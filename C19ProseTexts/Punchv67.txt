IT was the mid of night: “Twelve " clashed from the great bell of St. Paul's. Almost at the same moment-allowing for
1 the difference of longitude—“Twenty-four" clanged from the great bell of St. Peter's. Two venerable forms sat on the
oblatest part of the terrestrial spheroid, listening.
“ Urbi !" shrilled Papa Punch, as the last boom of St. Paul's died away.
“ Orbi !" sighed Papa Pius, as if in unison with the dying thrill of St. Peter's.
Then, suddenly turning on their respective axes, they survey ed each other—these two INFALLIBLES !
“ That 's' urbi et orbi' between us,” remarked Papa Punch, blandly.
“I do not divide my Empire," grumbled PAPA Pius, edging away from his companion.
“Why not?” said Papa Punch, cheerfully. “The world has seen two Popes sharing St. Peter's Cbair between 'em
before this. But where CLEMENT and URBAN fought, let Punch and Pius fraternise."
“ Apage, Sathanas . . . Excommunico te- Anathema- ” But the hand of Papa Purch was already on the lips
of Papa Pius.
“ Connu, mon vieux. ... 'It won't go off !'—you know. Keep your breath to cool your pasta. Cursing is the worst
use the wind of man can be put to. Suppose we reasoned ?".
“ Cursing is in my line. Reasoning isn't,” angrily retorted Papa Pius. “Sum Pater infallibilis," he went on, "et
sum super ratiocinationem," and he closed his eyes, folded his hands over his abdomen, and smiled to himself with an air of
ineffable self-satisfaction.
“ But when there are two Infallibles, my dear Pius, I really don't see how our respective claims are to be settled.
Unless, indeed,” added Papa Punch, with a flash of happy inspiration, “ you liked to toss for it."
“Agreed !” said Papa Pius, eagerly, whipping out a penny.
“One of Peter's ? " asked Papa Punch, winking interrogatively towards the coin.
“I believe you, my boy,” replied Papa Pius, winking back. “There's more where that came from. Here goes !
heads I win, tails you lose,'”—and he prepared to spin the consecrated coin.
“O fie, Papa," good-humouredly remonstrated Papa Punch. “Not if I know it."
“That's our Roman game,” said Papa Pius, pausing in act to spin, with an air of injured innocence. Quod
semper, quod ubique, quod ab omnibus,'--you know."
“Yes, I know. So suppose, instead of tossing, we split our difference divide the world between us ? "
“. Divide et impera,' you mean, of course ? ” was PAPA Pius's more complacent rejoinder. “An excellent principle,
and one those dear Fathers of the Congregation understand to perfection, as they may show your BISMARCKS and your
GLADSTONES one of these days."
"• Divide et impera' be it. The old women of both sexes, and the Priests in both Churches fall to you by a process of
natural selection, and I'll throw you in all the dilettante who want Churches turned into playhouses, with appropriate
music, dresses, and decorations, and all who would rather not call their souls their own, but prefer to have their faiths
fixed, and their minds made up for them. Then you may bave all who have never read history, or seen through pious
fiction ; all who've forgotten there ever was such a thing as an Inquisition in Spain, or faggots in Smithfield.”

“Ah, happy days!" sighed Papa Pius. “When the Secular Arm was in its proper place, under the orders of the
Spiritual Head. There was a Christendom then !—now, 'tis a Chaos. And you," he went on, his urbanity gradually
oozing away through his irritation, "you dare to sit there, and look me in the face, and call yourself Infallible! You
Infallible, indeed !—Where's your cathedra ? ”
“ In the office, 85, Fleet Street, Editor's room-first-floor front."
“ And your Bark of St. Peter ? "
“I'll back Toby's against it."
" And your pastoral staff ? "
PAPA PUNCH held up his truncheon.
“ And your Ring ?”
“ Roo-too-it !" chimed PAPA PUNCH, with one of his most tintinnabulary flourishes.
“ And your Keys ? "
“ Wit and Wisdom !”
“ And your Apostolic See ?".
“ Rome, like your own. I was established there from times even anterior to yours. Can I not trace my Atellanic
succession from Maccus and Pappus—through Pulcincellus—down to Punca—your humble servant—simple as he stands
here?"
“ And your General Councils ? "
“ The Wise of all time."
“ Your badges of Universality ?—your quod semper ?'"
“My good sense and good humour."
“ Your quod ubique ?'"
“My circulation."
“Your . quod ab omnibus ? "
“My welcome!”
" But you ain't Infallible. There can't be two Infallibles, I tell you—and I'm the only one now travelling, and here's
my title-deed !” So saying, he drew from under his cassock a huge roll, inscribed, “ Infallibility; Vatican Decree, 1870."
“And I don't care for your DOLLINGERS, or GLADSTONES, or Actons, or PETRES, or CAMOYSES—e'er a one of 'em—and I dare
any of 'em to tread on the tails of my coat." And the old gentleman, now thoroughly irritated by self-assertion, brandished
the roll wildly, and prepared to come down with it—"whack”—on Punch's devoted head !
Luckily, that Protestant Papa Antipapa was able, by a nimble movement, to upheave VOLUME SIXTY-SEVEN
as a buckler between the Holy Father's swashing blow and bis devoted pate.
The untrustworthy weapon collapsed at contact with the sevenfold shield of Bull's-hide,-appropriate binding of Bull's
bosom friend and breast-plate-Punch.
Hitherto that Hero had stood on the defensive ; but, like Fitz-James's blade in the encounter with Roderick Dhu,
PA Punch's book “was sword and shield.”
From defence to offence was but a step.
When grey morning rose upon the encounter, Papa Punca had Papa Pius on the reel-and, with the sharpest
points of Volume Sixty-seven, was beating a terrible tattoo on ihe venerable bread-basket of the Holy Father, who vainly
attempted to interpose between his midriff and that irresistible battering-ram the weak defence of the Vatican Infallibility
Decree!

THE country sadly wanted rain;
It han't come none too soon.
O’drought the Farmers did complain
Till nigh the end o' June.
We hadn't scarce had nare a drop
Not sence the fust o' May;
And things looked uglee für the crop
O' turmuts, and the hay.

Stuck restiff as a pig.
And when a' shifted fur a bit,

What times to raain it tried.

Our early 'taturs late.

Fur loonaties to ate.
No frogs nor slugs nor snails about,
Which they Mooshoes devour.

As well as yarb and vlower.

REGATTA RAIN.
Ar Henley the rain you can never restrain,
The glass may go up, but 'tis perfectly vain ;
The Clerk of the Weather, with utter disdain,
Washes all the barometers down, in the train
Of his fast-falling thunder-flood, good for the grain,
But not for the nymphs of their finery vain,
Or the swells, who will never their stiffness regain,
Till they're valetted well, and have had some Champagne,
And have sworn that they won't go to Henley again.
The Red Lion's hostess must snobs entertain,
But no one observes her to greatly complain;
And, by this time, she's probably used to the rain-
That annual deluge that ne'er seems to wane,
But swells Father Thames till he widens his lane,
And floods the flat meadows, and threatens to reign
O'er the streets of the town, and the Mayor's bothered brain.

MR. PUNCH is pained to notice that there exist certain snoblings,
in good clothing, who, when the National Anthem is performed
within their hearing, omit the usual act of loyalty, and neglect
to take their hats off. Possibly they are fearful lest their long ears
should be seen if they were to stand bareheaded. Mr. Punch

than he did on Tuesday. The best and worst that can
be said of CROSS's Bill is that it is a supplement of

In the Commons, we had the first night of the great

Punch follows the precedent of the O'CONNOR POWER

old proverb about throwing a tub to a whale. ... Substi-
tuting "BUTT” for “tub, this is about the sum and sub-
stance of Tuesday and Thursday night's eloquence. Only
it was a Butt without a bottom. There was no reality
in the whole business. The Member for Limerick and
his supporters were not talking for England, but for
their Home-Rulers, that is the least intelligent part of
their Irish constituencies. They know themselves that
the ear of Parliament is closed, the mind of Parliament
made up, on the point, even as the ear and mind of JOHN
BULL out of Parliament. And more, they know-nine-
tenths of them--that they are talking bunkum—talking
what they no more believe themselves, than they expect
JOHN BULL to believe that they believe. The truths on
the subject are disagreeable ones, but they lie in a
nut-shell; and Punch can formulate some of them which
SIR MICHAEL HICKS BEACH and the MARQUIS OF HART-
INGTON and MR. DISRAELI can not put quite so plainly.
They are these :
Home-Rule means-
Rome-rule in School legislation : Peasant-rule in
Land legislation: Protectionist-rule in Trade legisla-

WELL, Par, Home-Rule has had its innings:

You tell us, through that famous seer,

But where's the Press, or far, or near,

Still, as Join BULL his history traces,
Nation he sees that Clan effaces :
So 'tis, has been, shall be.
When ALFRED thrashed the wild sea-rover,
And made the war-Dane wince,
Did not your learned men come over,
Take wives, and settle here, in clover,
To teach us, ages since ?
And in this Parliament of ours,
What a part you have borne !
Where PLUNKETT'S, CURRAN'S, GRATTAN'S powers
So oft have winged Debate's dull hours
From midnight into morn.
Genius is yours, if we've more talent ;
And never soldier stood
One 'gainst a host, as gay as gallant,
But for each Saxon, or Scotch callant,
Ireland brought two as good.
A threefold cord our fathers twisted,
Ne'er to untwist again.
In British ranks three strains enlisted,
The world in arms have still resisted,
Nor turned from face of men.
In as much John to Par knocks under,
As over him he towers ;
We can't afford the tie to sunder;

While London's yours and ours.

Acrobatic Children are boneless. Turkeys are sometimes boned.
Children are sometimes boned by gipsies. These had been boned.
This was how it was done.
Their performance was to fly like birds, to the sound of a trumpet.
They had been carefully supplied with food.
TOMMY, waking first, got it all.
This made PICKLE-LILLY, the youngest, to cry bitterly. POLLY
sat in her cradle-nest and looked on hungrily. The little ones

The child's cry is a sublime psalm. To make it cry is to make it

Inscribed with equal parts of fear and rage.

And own the care which corrugates my brow:
Out on the laws, which, vexing railway swains,
Increase their outlay, and reduce their gains !
Hobbs. I, too, confess to anger and alarm,
In expectation of approaching harm
Through acts which will amerce us, and restrain
From sending doubtful ships to plough the main.
Dobbs. O heavy load of penalties and pains
Incurred by accidents befalling trains,
Averted only by precautions, such
As cost as nearly, if not quite as much!
Hobbs. Alas, our loss in ships from sailing stayed,
By interference of the Board of Trade!
And curst be they new trammels who propose,
The Sailor's friends, but the ship-owners' foes !
Dobbs. Collisions between trains bring grievous woe.
How many bones are broken at a blow!
Juries, with sympathy which knows no bounds,
May for one limb award one thousand pounds;
And, to relations, suing for their dead,
They often give e'en more than that, per head.
Hobbs. There's serious talk of legislation, too,
To give surviving kin the power to sue
When vessels, proved unseaworthy, go down.
So we shall have to pay when Sailors drown,

Be made, besides, indictable for crime.
Dobbs. Come to mine arms, my Brother in distress.

Against the first we remedy have none.
Its will, if not evaded, must be done.
Upon the latter we may turn and sting;
Your action, thus, for libel you can bring.

He'll gain his object nearly, if not quite.
The Government will take his oause in hand.
Would that his flesh were flayed, his hide were tanned!

This fair isle of ours becomes a land of light.
Can we not negative the poet's mournful murmur-.
“Where the wealth accumulates, there the men decay?"
Cannot party-leaders grasp with fingers firmer
This the future's problem, the question of the day?

When there's free space for every son of labour,

When hot antagonists, labourer and farmer,

Where wisdom toils to sow the future's seeds ;'
Whence if some weeds spring up whose taste is bitter,
They yet are always medicinal weeds.
POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE.
ASSUREDLY the French are a most inventive people, and in few
ways is their talent more surprisingly made manifest than in the
tales which they invent respecting things which are not French.
For instance, here is a description, translated from a Paris news-
paper, of the duties which in England devolve upon a “ Whip":-
“ The Parliamentary "Whip' is a young Member who spends his life in a
gig whipping a thoroughbred (hence his name) and running after the mem-
bers of his party when a division of any importance is expected. He pursues
them at the park, at their friends', male and female, et souvent ces recherches
donnent lieu a des incidents delicats ; in short, he takes no rest until he has
unearthed them, and brought them down to the House."
To this accurate account we may append some minor details,
which are heartily at the service of enlightened foreign journalists :-
The Whip's gig is called a “sulky” (une boudeuse), and derives
its name from the fact that it is made to hold three persons, this
being by the English deemed a most unsocial number, as is shown
by the old proverb which declares that “two are company, but three
are none."
The thoroughbred employed is the Winner of the Derby, which is
invariably purchased by the Government at the finish of the race.
The animal is then placed under the care of the Master of the Horse,
and, after a month's training in the Circus known as “ASTLEY's,"
is prepared to go the rounds which constitute the West End circuit
of the Whip. By an ancient Act of Parliament, the LORD MARE is
required to sow a peck of wild oats yearly in the garden of the
Mansionsouse, and the crop is duly garnered for the thoroughbred, a
stable being found him at the place called Horseliedown.
Liberal, Conservative, think both of your pledges,
Which shall redeem them best-be that your race !
Gather from the back-slums, the hovels, and the hedges,
Young cubs still human in the soul as in the face.
Seek them where'er in ignorance they grovel,
Be it in the gutter or the reeking alley's den;
Be it in the labourer's damp o'ercrowded hovel-
Think-a nation's strength and wealth are in its men.

While round our nose careers the pleasant wasp.

With heartbrug covers up the shining grate,

In the coal-cellar hides her timid head.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

VERY WARM WORK.
Among the news of the week nobody can be surprised
| by the announcement that:-
“The difficulty of keeping down the temperature in the House
of Commons as the heat increases has necessitated the use of a
greater quantity of ice over which the air is passed before it
reaches the cbamber. The consumption is now one ton per
night, and the extra cost thus entailed is about $20 per week.”
The debates on the Public Worship Bill have appa-
rently been attended with an actual rise of physical
temperature. Hence it would seem that fiery eloquence
and the heat of argument are not mere phrases; that
"thoughts which breathe” do in breathing really involve
combustion by the combination of oxygen with carbon,
and “ words that burn” liberate sensible caloric. It
is a pity that the necessity for icing the atmosphere of
the House of Commons, created by these conditions
occurring in the Dog Days, precludes the experiment,
which would be highly interesting if it could be tried,
of testing by thermometer the comparative warmth of
the House during theological and secular debates.

HAIL, Perspiration! cleanser of the pores,
Foe to the subtle acids that infect
The stream of life! Who does not love thee well,
When on the green are pitched the cool white tents,
And clad in flannel, wearing shoes well spiked,
We play the game of games ? Hot let it be
As ever Phæbus made it, or as when
Phaëton drew down Jove's thunder, feebly holding
His sire's wild steeds- the exulting blood within
Makes such heat tame. Or when, with bending oars,
We pass reach after reach of glorious Thames,
A lady steering; with each well-pulled stroke
The body lightens, and the spirit grows
Stronger and clearer. O, the drowsy woods,
The flashing mill-race, and the lazy lock,
Where waiting brings flirtation! Am I warm ?
Yes, but I like it : yes, but I enjoy
My tankard, ere we try another spurt.
SMITH does the same, and I delight to see
SMITH's friendly, ugly, humorous, sunburnt face
Through the glass bottom of the silver mug
As he inverts it like a gentleman.
Now is the time when my great wolfhound loves
To lave his tawny sides in Thames, and roll
In fresh-cut grass thereafter. He has read
No silly paragraphs on Rabies,
And won't go mad at present. Flies there are ;
Granted : but how the deuce would that sweet bird,
“The temple-haunting martlet,” live without ?
And there are thunderstorms. I love to see
Pure fire of ether in its zig-zag lines
Dazzling against dark cloud; I love to hear
The boom of the great thunder, and to feel
The close air cleared by each electric flash,
Till the birds sing again, and fields smell sweet,
And the great arch is thrown from hill to hill,
As when the Patriarchs saw it. Theatres
We have not here, but Night, the fair lessee
Of Nature's Theatre Royal, has her stars,
Her orchestra the music of the spheres.
Then there's a Comet, wherein sodium lines
May be distinguished, if you deftly place
Brandy and soda in your spectrum-glass.
The necessary cat comes never near
My realm: the far more necessary dog
Would soon reduce him to his last mol-row;
And, for a reason not dissimilar,
The genial burglar never burgles here,
But plies his trade where spoons are plentiful :
For cottage windows open all night long,
And the aroma of cigars that calm
The mind into a state to write to Punch
Something as perfect as the diamond
On SAPPHO's finger, tempt not WILLIAM SIKES ;
Nor does he care to have his vituline
Protuberance (he perhaps might call it calf)
Gripped by an honest English mastiff's teeth.
No, I sleep sound : if gnats come, I don't know it,
But wake to exclaim, "O glorious Summer! Go it!
Bring perfect perspiration to your poet!”

past scandals. The Edmunds mess
(Monday, July 13) having been
stirred by the gentleman who
made it-or, rather, by a clever
young Lord whom he had induced
to stir it for him-LORD SELBORNE
was obliged to rake up again a
great deal that, for MR. EDMUNDS'
sake, had better be kept buried.
No one wants to hit MR. EDMUNDS
now he is down, and it is open to
any Lord or Commoner even to
pity him, and to think, and call
him, an unfortunate man. But
there public sympathy must stop.
The request of MR. EDMUNDS for
a pension as having resigned an
office he ought never to have re-
ceived is nothing short of what,
in a less unfortunate offender,
would be called impudence.
In the Commons, the Right
Hon. BENJAMIN DISRAELI, with
that graceful diffidence which
belongs to him at such moments,
promised the House a gladiatorial
entertainment on Wednesday and
Friday next, in which he would
have the honour to play Retiarius
to MR. GLADSTONE'S Secutor.
The Public Worship Regula-
tion Bill was not a Government
Measure, but Government, having
allowed it to be brought in, was
bound to find time for its discus-
sion. MR. GLADSTONE having given
notice of Resolutions, which amounted to a repeal of the Act of Uniformity, the
Government was bound to give him rope enough. So Orders of the day and
Wednesday's Standing Orders would be swept on one side, a clear stage-and no
favour-made for W. E. G., -and then for the gladiatorial interlude he had
promised them. (Sensation prolongée.)
The House got back to the adjourned Kirk Patronage debate, but evidently
"with minds distraught and thoughts elsewhere." Every head was running on the
anticipation of the royal entertainment promised for the fag-end of the week. In the midst of this distraction the abolition of Kirk
Patronage was rediscussed, Sir R. ANSTRUTIER complaining bitterly that the Liberal party should have been “whipped "against the Bill
to please MR. GLADSTONE, and indeed openly revolting against the Gladstonian “lead” in the matter. As if this had been the only
revolt of the week! The Second Reading was carried by 307 to 109-in the teeth of MR. GLADSTONE.
Tuesday.-LORD SANDON announced that Government intended to give the coup-de-grâce to the Endowed Schools Commission, to hand
over their work to the Charity Commissioners, reinforcing that body so that they might get through their work of cleansing the Augean
(we beg pardon—we should say the Endowed School) stable in five years, and laying down new rules, calculated to secure more weight
to founders' wishes-especially when they tended to give the lion's share of endowments to the Established Church.
The move is a mistake—the most serious mistake Government have yet committed-a move backwards, as MR. GLADSTONE and
MR. FORSTER very clearly showed.
The Opposition are bound to fight this Bill for putting up a bar on Endowed-School-doors which the late Government's Bill ap-
pointing the Commission took down. If they can stop its progress by any Parliamentary tactics they have a right to use them. It
will be but clapping a stone behind the wheel of the Endowed-School "trap,” to which LORD Sandon and his friends are for giving a
shove backwards and down-hill.
True, the Commission has become unpopular. People armed with besoms and set to sweeping out dark and dirty places seldom are
popular with the bats and black-beetles. But suppose the Commission has been too doctrinaire or too drastic, the Government
might have infused a soothing, softening, and sobering element into it. To do away with it is a sin and a shame. To hark back to
"founders’ wills"—that great bugbear and barrier of all real Educational improvement-is worse than a sin and a shame, it is a
gross blunder. It is hanging round the neck of middle-class JOHN BULL, on his way to the Educational waters he stands so much in
need of, the clog which he had reason to think himself rid of for good and all. It is a violation of the sound principle which-as
MR. GLADSTONE truly said, distinguishes our Parliamentary Government from all others, “ Vestigia nulla retrorsum.” It is saying,
in effect, that the wills and prejudices of the ancient dead shall override the wisdom and needs of the actual living. It is thrusting back
the hands of the dial, and advancing by retrogression.
Fight it, FORSTER—fight it to the last man in town, the last hour of the Session, the last breath in your political body. Now is
the moment for a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether from Her Majesty's Opposition, if there be such a thing!
Wednesday, MR. DISRAELI cleared the floor for the fight on the Public Worship Bill. There was a demure twinkle in the eye,
an ominous calm in the bearing of the Right HONOURABLE B. HECTOR, and a smouldering fire, dark and dangerous, in the look of the
RIGIT HONOURABLE W. E. ACHILLES, as each armed for the encounter.
But unto him, as, to his Captains turned,
The scornful question, Was't for this he came?'
In his red eye the fire of battle burned,
And, warned in time, this fatal fight forbear,
Far-sighted FORSTER and grave Goschen drew,
That brings defeat to thee, to us despair.
And their wet blankets o'er Achilles threw.
Or if thou, blinded by the wrath of Jove,
“See where our host, reluctant, backward draws,
Must needs to battle on such issue move,
Averse to follow thee in such a cause :
Expect to see thy Captains, sore in grief,
See their ranged points sink lower and more low;
Turn their reluctant arms against their Chief;
See ready shaft withdrawn from slackened bow;
Till all alone, left by thy former train,
See where asunder shrink the serried shields,
Against the foe thou shalt the fight sustain.
Till all their wavering battle yawns and yields;
Ili fares the Chief who so directs his blow
Hear the scarce smothered murmur at thy name,
As to make foe of friend, and friend of foe.

Still the come on, for to bite the duhan in my ore
Lo, where the Bill which thou art fain to stay,
Through Second Reading moves, without a Nay;
Then pause, Achilles, ere it is too late,
Nor, spurning counsel, rush upon thy fate."
Achilles groaned and chafed, but gazing round,
Clear confirmation of this warning found :
The while he paused, for once, to count the costs,
Plume-shaking Hector strode betwixt the hosts,
Brandished his lance and cried, “Why stay the Chief,
FORSTER and GOSCHEN, who will come to grief?
Myself the champion of this Bill I own,
Not less strong in your strength than in my own;
But if Achilles wills to bite the dust,
Let him come on, for Nemesis is just !

My banded host 'gainst Ritual rebels stands,
To bow reluctant Church to Law's commands.

He cannot say the choice was mine, I ween,
Though, had I chosen, this my choice had been.
Then let him raise his war-cry, 'Church 'gainst Law,'
Or from his Resolutions Six withdraw,
And, owning himself vanquished without strife,
Avoid the field, and back to lettered life.

its £87,000 of debt, its white rowdies, reprobates, and kidnappers,
and its less savage mountain black-fellows? The island authori-
ties, such as they are, offer us the islands. Commissioners have
reported in favour of acceptance. LORD CARNARVON has considered
the matter all round-north, south, east, and west- and has come
to the conclusion that if we accept the islands, it must be undon-
ditionally; and if we govern the islands, it must be as a Crown
colony “of rather a severe type," that is, as a despotism pur et
simple. Like the Waggoner in Æsop's fable, we have called on
Hercules — SIR HERCULES ROBINSON to wit — who from South
Australia is to visit Fiji and report, and by him the Government
will be guided. But JOHN BULL cannot allow that horrible
“blackbirding” to go on. And LORD CARNARVON's conclusions
seem, on the whole, sound ; at least, we find nothing in Thursday
night's cons to overbalance the pros in their favour.

EXEUNT THE SIX RESOLUTIONS.
THOSE Six Resolutions! O, GLADSTONE, 'twas cruel
In caniculæ horá to challenge a duel-
By the light of a forest of Ritual torches,
When Phoebus Apollo sufficiently scorches.
We thought that your spirit, to cool down its glow,
had
Gone where the Ægean embraces the Troad;
Had traversed the sea which Phoenicia environs,
Out of earshot of chants from Gregorian Sirens.

And received at his hands a new spell to throw o'er us
From his rolling hexameters, strong and sonorous.
Disillusion indeed! As Apollo and Sirius
For cool dress and cool drinks make parched London
delirious,
From his tent our Achilles indignant emerges,
And his war-cry rings out as High-Church Boanerges.
The Romanist poachers on Anglican manors
May echo his cry and may flock to his banners;
But John BULL in his Church wants one cooling
ingredient-
That that Church to the Law should be humbly
obedient.
That Church may be even deformed with anomalies-
Its Articles may not agree with its Homilies-
But it has not quite reached such a point of deformity
As perverting its Rubrics to sheer Rome-conformity.

A POINT OF SIMILITUDE.
CABMEN are at present a much more
respectable class than they were formerly.
Satire on their dishonesty would be now
out of date. But men yet living may
be able to recollect a caricature in the
printshops, representing a cabman as being
told to drive to the Old Bailey, and re-
plying that he did not know where it was.
An odious comparison is not to be drawn;
but when, in the debate on the Public
Worship Bill, MR. DISRAELI observed that
the Right Hon. Gentleman the Member
for Greenwich said that he did not know
what Ritualism was, did not the PREMIER
suggest a very striking resemblance, in
point of innocence at least, between that
Right Honourable Gentleman and that
cabman ?

Or, in English, “The measure that's one set o' men's meat
is another set o' men's poison."
In the Commons was fought the first real fight of the
Session, on the Endowed Schools Bill. Her Majesty's
Opposition in good force, Punch is happy to say. MR.
FAWCETT hit out in his best style, putting ~ Vestigia nulla
retrorsum” into the shape of an Amendment on going into
Committee, and was well seconded by LORD G. CAVENDISH,
one of the most moderate and conciliatory of men. LORD
SANDON protests the Bill is misunderstood. It is not meant
to shut out Dissenting pupils from either the instruction or
prizes of Endowed Schools, nor Dissenting parents from
their government, nor to confine head-masterships to men
in orders.
But the practical question is not what is the Bill meant to do-latet dolus interpretatione-but what does it do? And that seems
precisely what nobody, on either side, is in a position to say definitely and decisively. In the meantime Honourable Members put on
the paper all manner of Amendments, to prevent the evil consequences which LORD SANDON says the Bill will not have ; the law-officers are
silent, the Opposition indignant, Ministerial supporters divided and discouraged. The one thing clear is that MR. DISRAELI has
made a mistake, under the malign influence of the Marquis, and will do well to lose no time in imitating the Scotch trespasser
detected half-way through a garden paling, who, when asked where he was going, sagaciously answered, “Book agin.”
If the Commissioners are to go, let them; though the Minister who flings his Jonah, or Board of Jonahs, overboard, is apt to have
him, or them, come back, and as a rule unpleasantly, after many days.
It is bad enough in a Minister to swap horses while crossing the river, and try shifting the heavy pack of Endowed School Reforms
from a Commission that knows it to a Board that has it still to learn. But at least, let the mischief stop there. Besides ohanging hands
at the broom, why put a new lock on the Augean Stables ?
Tuesday.-Cold consolation to Spanish bond-holders from LORD DERBY in answer to LORD HAMPTON. No doubt this last swindle
of the bond-holders has been brazen even beyond the usual Spanish brass ; a certain batch of Pagarés,-a facetious word in Spain,
meaning “I will pay,”-having been sent over here to meet the claims of the bond-holders, and since boned by the Spanish Finance
Minister. But as LORD DERBY points out, with sweet and instructive candour, “the real check on these proceedings is the injury they
are calculated to do public credit.” “ Où il n'y a rien, le roi perd ses droits," was an old French proverb. The idea of Spanish
credit being damaged by anything now possible in financing!
In the Commons adjourned debate over going into Committee on Endowed Schools Bill. Everybody as much in the dark as yesterday,
as to what the Bill would do, or would not do. There seems to be the utmost haziness, even among those responsible for the ill-advised
measure, as to what it was meant to do. The most candid men on the Government side of the House repudiate retrogression,
e. g., SIR J. KENNAWAY, COLONEL BARTELOTT and MR. RUSSELL GURNEY—with a goodly batch behind them, as well vocal as
silent Members. It becomes more and more evident every hour the Bill is debated that three out of the six clauses will have to be
dropped, and the Bill pass as a bare sentence of death on the Commission. They will die, if they die, for having worked "not wisely but
too well.” Punch offers an inscription for their tombstone: -
The School Commission here lie we,
Now dead as is the Do-do,
Of too much fortiter in re,
Too little suaviter in modo.
Having sealed the Commissioners' death-warrant, let the rest of the Bill drop. Can't the MARQUIS OF SALISBURY take the mischief its
first three clauses will do as a sufficient consideration for the withdrawal of the three last ?
Wednesday. The whole sitting was occupied in fighting the Endowed Schools Bill. The Bill was successfully kept out of Committee
through the whole sitting. The same haze still hangs about this luckless and lamentable measure; the same doubts as to its action
and its intention; nobody, apparently, except its enemies--and MR. A. B. Hope, who clings to it in solitary desperation-having any
heart in the fight over it.
MR. DISRAELI must withdraw half of it, at least, if he means to pass any part of it into law. He need not much mind, though
MR. HOPE should then complain of it as “ monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui numen ademptum."
In the evening, at the Mansion House, coming in the wake of Tuesday's more illustrious guests—Captains of the Pen, Ministers of

AMONG THE OLD MASTERS.
Master Tommy. “I SUPPOSE THAT WHEN THIS NICE, BRIGHT, CLEAN, NEW PICTURE IS FINISHED, THAT NASTY DINOY OLD ONE WILL
BE TAKEN DOWN, AND THIS ONE PUT IN ITS PLACE!”
That was a pageant with the night that fades;
And so may fade the triumph of a Minister.
Then while the nation's wish for quiet aids,
Do you refrain from crass reaction's raids,
Lest Augur Punch should say “ The signs grow sinister.”
BETTER DO-NOTHING THAN DO-ILL.
(“Surtout, point de zèle." A Hint to Lothair.)
“Montas, idle months!” You know not what they mean!
Nor, since you sketched your boyish hero Vivian,
A Cabinet-maker of about nineteen,
One single idle moment have you seen-
You hate repose, which for you means oblivion.
You select Castle Indolent for seat !
Who fancied that, was singularly hazy:
You, who the war of words delight to meet;
Who love the arena heated to blood-heat;
Whom a do-nothing week would drive clean crazy.
You'd fain, you say, curb passions in the Church;
Secure more comfort to the peasant's hovel,
Restore to life the Pious Founder's birch-
And, if your following leave you in the lurch,
Your idlest month might yield its brilliant novel.
Premier, mystery-man, and novelist,
Sharp as you are, you have subs who would use you.
Wield your keen rapier with a facile wrist,
Brave e'en Achilles as antagonist,
But “point de zèle"-'tis too soon yet to lose you.
From Mansion House to Marlborough House you came,
That night when Fashion flaunted a new feather,
Where TITIAN's beauties graced an English frame,
And pretty Puritans set hearts a-flame
With coquetry and Quakerism together.
Where ransacked records of Romance and History
Yielded their quaintest and most witohing fashions ;
Where capered the Court cards, in quaint consistory,
Each tabarded quadrille a moving mystery,
And you, the Sphinx, calm gauger of all passions!
WONDERS OF MODERN TRAVEL.
WONDER whether accidents will be as numerous as usual during
this excursion season.
Wonder if a train, conveying third-class passengers, was ever
known to start without somebody or other exclaiming, “ Now we're
off!"
Wonder why it is that foreigners in general, and fat Germans in
particular, always will persist in smoking with the windows shut.
Wonder whether anybody was ever known to bellow out the name
of any station in such a manner that a stranger could succeed in
| understanding him.
Wonder whether it is cheaper to pay for broken bones, or for such
increase of service as, in very many cases, might prevent their
being broken.
Wonder how a signalman can by any means contrive to keep a
cool head on his shoulders, while working as one sees him in a
signal-box of glass, and the temperature of the tropics.
Wonder if upon an average there are three men in a thousand
who have never been puzzled by the hieroglyphics in Bradshaw.
Wonder whether any Railway Guard or Porter has ever been
detected in the very act of virtuously declining to accept a proffered
tip, on the ground that money, by the bye-laws, is forbidden to be
taken by Servants of the Company.
Wonder how many odd coppers the boys who sell the newspapers
pocket in a week by the benevolence of passengers.
Wonder what diminution there would be in the frequency of
| accidents, supposing Directors were made purse-onally liable.
Wonder whether people take to living at Redhill because it is so

“SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER.”
(A RECOLLECTION OF GOODWOOD.)
LUSK ET LUX.
(Letters and Arts feasted by the LORD MAYOR at the
Mansion House, July 21st, 1874.)
LETTERS and Arts asked to taste civic turtle!
Rich grains of mind clean wintowed from the husk!
The poets', painters', singers' hays and myrtle
Twined with your civic laurels, LORD MAYOR LUSK!
'Tis well one bard, with not too many a wrinkle,
Of lettered statesmanship the flag could bear,
Telling how VIVIAN GREY, M.P., could twinkle,
To shine, “ Premier des Premiers," as Lothair.
But HOUGHTON-Punch feels doubts about the title
By which he on SIR ANDREW's right appears-
Is that high place of honour the requital
Of Peer 'mong poets-Poet among peers ?
Why ask? All own he plays well either part,
Sustains both rankomstill cordial, good at need;
Who never lets the hand gainsay the heart
Ready to crown kind word with kinder deed.
He knew Great ALFRED in his dawn at Trinity,
And heard the prelude of his glorious chimes :
Lives to be startled from his equanimity
By SWINBURNE's loose Muse, sans reproche-for
rhymes;
From boyish memories he can give description
Of CATALANI's trumpet-tones at York,
To the strange concert, for the Hall Egyptian,
Of TimJEN'S, NILSSON's, Patti's knife and fork !
Wondrous conjunction! Three such stars bid glow
In one night and one heaven, yet bode no dread,
No earthquake shaking operas here below!
So Lord Mayors rush where Lessees fear to tread.
And lesser lights were there, names known of men,
Each a great planet in its proper sky
Of verse or prose, form, colour, or sweet sound,
Gathered to make up Lusk a galaxy!
The crafts the Times once cuffed they now caress;
Grub Street'sgone, with its scribes, tattered and lean,
The bulk their bed, the blanket oft their dress—
CAVE's beef to JOHNSON thrust behind the screen.
Now Arts and Letters defy bankrupt's dockets-
Are paid and pay: i' the City sit at ease :
Men, in good coats, with money in both pockets :
Ladies, with diamonds as big as peas !
What fogy asks has Art risen with the price of it ?
If“ le jeu vaut la chandelle" hints a doubt:
Were the cake in his reach he'd take a slice of it:
'Tis not from one of the well-paid, that flout.
Art ne'er had so much honour, so much money,
So many diamonds, since 'twas first a sinner;
Never had so much treacle, sugar, honey,
All sorts of sweet things-ending with Lusk's dinner!
O yes, the City loves Art-is possessor
Of a large stock-in-trade of works of mind.
But who's this out-at-elbows Art-professor
Whom I hear yonder, grumblingly inclined ?
“What is your money to my untold treasure,
By me, PAUL PENNILESS, bought for a song,
A verse, a picture—wealth, yours cannot measure,
To whom both Easts-London's and Earth's—belong!
“Money is good, and Lord Mayors' invitations,
Well meant, well given, and kindly ta'en as offered ;
But there's no gold-gauge for mind-mensuration,
Nor is Art paid for when cash-price is proffered :
Money, the saw says, will make Mayors to go;
Mayors it may, but not Artists nor their Arts;
Or with the cash now Art-wards bid to flow,
More of Art's life-blood would run in our hearts.
" Men talk of merchant-princes, cities fair
Where Art and Commerce once walked hand in hand,
Serene and stately sisters, in warm air,
By sapphire sea, on marble-terraced strand.
Alas! no Venice, Florence, here can rise,
For all our money, Mansion House, and Mayor-

WAYS AND NEW ONES.
THE Keystone loose in Temple Bar !
The Monument a-going !
What is there that's worth living for,
As they ain't overthrowing ?
They tell me that the sinking's caused
By Law-Court excavations-
I thought the City and the Law
Stood on the same foundations !
Well, now-a-days folks will go down
To'what's called “ fundamentals ;"
Will know what all things stand upon,
From men's faith to their rentals.
But I say, take care how you dig,
Lest in your spade-work's smother,
While one foundation you prepare,
You meddle with another.
Lest digging to old basements down,
And rooting up old curbing,
You loose the keystone of some arch
You ne'er thought of disturbing.
The old Bar might be troublesome,
It might impede the traffic ;
It mightn't be the gate to make
A figure in the Graphic:
But 'twas a symbol of the rights
Of Home-Rule in the City,
And I can't help but feel the loss
Of what marks that, a pity.
I like to think o' Kings and Queens
Bound, crowns and all, to wait,
Until Lord Mayor and Aldermen
Chose to ope that there gate.
I like to think there once was heads
Of rebels stuck up there;
If only 'cause it shows the times
Are better than they were.
I like to think CHILD's books was kept
In that room o'er the centre;
How but through cash and well-kept
books
Should men the City enter ?
In short, though, if 'twas now to build,
I don't say I should choose it,
I was fond of old Temple Bar,
And shall be grieved to lose it.
If the old keystone should drop out,
Can't they put in a new one?
But as for pulling down the Bar-
The idea quite goes through one!

THE LAST OF AN OLD FRIEND.
"The Sea Serpent has not only been seen, but actually killed,
in the Republican River, near Scandia, in Kansas, United States.
The Serpent would probably have escaped, but for the happy
thought of MR. A. P. SMITH, who arrived on the scene with a
fire-extinguisher, primed with sulphuric acid and other
chemicals. This machine was aimed at the open jaws of the
monster, and a tremendous dose of the mixture was discharged
ly' into his throat. ... Such was the sad end of an
old and respected friend, who will be much missed when Parlia-
ment has been prorogued.” (See Pall Mall Gazette, July 22.)
At Parliament's next prorogation,
When Ministers rush to the Sea,
When lawyers begin their vacation,
And Londoners Oceanwards flee,
When the Claimant has lapsed into quiet,
And French “non” fights no longer with "oui,"
When the Carlists have ceased to run riot,
When Archbishops and Bishops agree,
When they've settled the Sun's composition,
When the Transit of Venus they see,
When Stroud is without a petition,
Returning a blameless M.P. ;
When BISMARCK no longer is shot at,
When the last has been talked of Fiji,
And when there's no news to be got at,-
Ah, then there 'll be mourning for thee!
No more will the “Dailies " inform us
Of thy gambols and antics so free,
Nor describe thy proportions enormous,
And length like a Peer's pedigree.

And bleared eyes beneath my degree,

The vanguard of the Carlist forces in Spain appears
to be employed less in diffusing Christian civilisation
than in waging civil war, as distinguished from civilised
warfare. The former, rather than the latter, in both the
Old Continent and the New, has for some time been the
sphere of action in which the Latin race has chiefly dis-
tinguished itself by its activity, if not by its intelligence.
There is much more reason to wish than to hope that
Spain may be destined to initiate its purification. But
unless that process is effected by some agency or other,
that race bids fair, or rather foul, to sink to a level
with the Mongolian or Malay, the Red Indian, or the
Nigger. Then, perhaps, Professors, lecturing on national

of my sentiments towards you. I speak emphatically the truth. You should receive an impression of my presence-profound, trans-
cendent, indelible. I would give you my hand; both my hands, with my whole heart.
One such book as One-and-Three suffices for a lifetime. Nothing more pathetic, nothing more dramatic, nothing more original.
You will understand me to speak of Une-et-Trois, not of your representation of it as One-and-Three.
I again felicitate you on being at so great a distance as you are from me,

HE following are the notes we have received from our Sport-

equivalent for the notes he has received from us, to say
nothing of that new HENRY's patent double central-fire

solation that if the notes are bad they are like the sport

North and South Vist.—The awfully hard weather-the
natives call it “soft” here-having rendered the chances
of winged game out of the question, the sportsmen who
have rented the shootings are glad to try the chances
of the game, sitting, and have confined themselves to the

of the island was not visiþle. Her friend, Mrs. Gamp, now
here on a visit, declares she saw Mrs. H. very recently, but
was quite unable to give me any information as to shoot-
ings, except the shootings of her own corns.

ally have been seriously considering the feasibility of
combining with those of the once well-stocked Drum
Moor in Aberdeenshire, to get up something like a band

the only bags made have been those of the proprietors
of the shootings, who have bagged heavy rentals.
Rum.- I call the island a gross-misnomer, as, there is nothing to drink in it but whiskey, which, with the adjacent “ Egg,” may
be supposed to have given rise to the neighbouring “Mull”-hot drinks being the natural resource of both natives and visitors in such
weather as we've had ever since I crossed the Tweed. I have seen one bird—at least so the gilly says-after six tumblers, but to me it

A PLEA FOR FAIR PLAY.
“PRINCE BISMARCK,” (says the Times) has received a letter
from some working men, expressing their determination to avenge
any attempt on his life by murdering a Catholic Bishop for every
bullet which does not hit him, and two Bishops for every bullet
which hits; while the one that really killed him should cost the
Pope his life.”
We are not told that PRINCE BISMARCK reprobated
the tone and spirit of this document. But reverse the
I picture. Suppose it to have emanated from some fanatical
band of Catholic working men, who had addressed the
POPE, telling him“ of their determination to murder a
Prussian General for every bullet that did not hit His
Holiness, and two Prussian Generals for every bullet
that did hit; while the one that should kill the POPE
should cost the EMPEROR WILLIAM his life,”—what an
outcry there would have been. How many fresh penal
laws would have been enacted in Germany, and how
every journal would have denounced the nefarious
schemes of the Ultramontanes. And if the POPE had
not rebuked these misguided men, what odium would
not PIUS. THE NINTH have incurred: and justly. But
PRINCE BISMARCK has not replied to these fanatics; he is
silent, and silence gives consent. We hope, for the
RESSED for his opinion on the subject of honour of humanity, and of BISMARCK, that the story
MARSHAL BAZAINE's escape from prison, is untrue. Still, at present, there it is—uncontradicted.

DEMOCRITUS AT BELFAST.
(See Report of PROFESSOR TYNDALL'8 Inaugural Discourse
to the British Association.)
TYNDALL, high-perched on Speculation's summit,
May drop his sounding-line in Nature's ocean,
But that great deep has depths beyond his plummet,
The springs of law and life, mind, matter, motion.
DEMOCRITUS imagined that the soul
Was made of atoms, spheric, smooth, and fiery:
PLATO conceived it as a radiant whole
A heavenly unit baffling Man's inquiry.
Indolent Gods, immeasurably bored,
Beyond the blast of Boreas and Eurus,
Too lazy Man to punish or reward,
Such was the Heaven conceived by EPICURUS.
If, as the wide-observant DARWIN dreams,
Man be development of the Ascidian,
Methinks his great deeds and poetic dreams
Scarce square with his molluscous pre-meridian.
But, even as MILTON's demons, problem-tossed,
When they had set their Maker at defiance,
Still “found no end, in wandering mazes lost,"
So is it with our modern men of science.
Still in the “ Open Sesame" of Law,
Life's master-key professing to deliver,
But meeting with deaf ear or scorn-clenched jaw,
Our question “ Doth not law imply law-giver?"
Betwixt the Garden and the Portico,
Thou, vacillating savant, often flittest,
And when we seek the source of law to know,

Pray who may be the fittest to survive,

WEETEST of Graces, with prettiest faces,
Meeting the rays of the Midsummer sun;
Trouble and sorrow postponed till the morrow,
Thinking of nothing but frolic and fun.
Clad in the lightest, the thinnest, the whitest
Dresses that ever by beauties were worn;
Fitting so neatly, and sitting so sweetly,
Though soon to be flabby, and tumbled, and torn.
Off amidst laughing and innocent chaffing,
Off to the fields and the forests so green;
Sure such a hearty and mirth-loving party,
So jolly and sociable, never was seen.
Horses the fleetest, with trappings the neatest,
Trotting along 'neath the tallest of trees :
Prancing, piaffing, at roadside wells quaffing,
Off again, sniffing the Midsummer breeze.
Singing and talking, and gentlemen walking
Up the steep hills, 'midst the dust of the wheels;
Ladies tormenting, in tones unrelenting ;
Torrents of laughter in merriest peals.
Under the willows, with hillocks for pillows,
Stretched on a velvety carpet of green;
Lots of flirtation, and sweet conversation;
_Compliments, praises, and glances serene.
Though in the sunshine, there's plenty of moonshine
Mixed with the sandwiches, chickens, and tarts;
Glasses upsetting, and gay dresses wetting,
Loosing of brooches, and losing of hearts.

Trouble and sorrow postponed till the morrow,
Thinking of nothing but lovers to-night.
Peacefully sleeping, with rosy cheeks peeping
Out of their halo of gold-tangled hair.
Sweet be their dreaming, for on them are beaming
Visions of happiness, perfect, and rare.
Through the green bushes the merriment rushes,
Hiding and seeking the foliage among;
Thickets exploring, with lovers adoring,
Startling the birds in the midst of their song.
Notions concerning the time for returning;
Long shadows falling like ghosts on the ground;
Daylight fast ending, as twilight descending
Časts a deep shade o'er the country around.
Back through the valley, where in and out dally
Merriest brooklets, through flags and through ferns :
Back by the sedges, and dust-covered hedges,
Back again homewards, the party returns.
Lonely lanes ringing with sweetest of singing ;
Villagers staring as wheels whirl along;
Countrymen smoking, desist from their joking,
And listen awhile to the far-sounding song.
Cot-garden flowers and wild hedge-row bowers,
Cottages, villages, swiftly are past;
Lights fast appearing show home they are nearing,
And happy at home they are welcomed at last !

THE CITY MULBERRY TREES.
DEGENERATE Drapers! Is it a fact
That the utilitarian cataract
_Your eyes has so served to harden,
That you really mean, for a paltry fee,
To disestablish the Mulberry Tree-
Grub up your lovely garden ?
A glimpse of green in the City's heart !
A little haven of rest apart
From Mammon's turmoil and trouble!
Pshaw! L.S.D. is the faith we hold.
Build over the fount with its fish of gold,
So our rental of gold we double.
'Tis the God of the Age, this L.S.D.-
The utilitarian trinity-
Whereof we are all adorers:
And a City Company's bound by its creed
To stick right close to the friend in need,
And scorn sentimental soarers.
So the Mulberry Trees are all laid low,
And there's an end to their golden glow-
The brighter that seemed for its rarity;
And may we ask-or were 't better not?
When the garden is gone and the money is got,
Will it be spent in Charity ?
Or will it be spent, City-Company-wise,
In making each dinner a new emprise
For digestion's taxed activity
What's a fountain fair to a turtle tureen,
Or the greenest lawn to the fat that's green .
At a gorgeous Hall-festivity ?
For this indeed did our Fathers build ?
Was guttling and gorging of each old Guild
The end, if not the beginner ?
Did they dream those Mulberry Trees must stoop
To furnish a little more turtle-soup
At the Drapers' magnificent dinner ?
Punch troweth not. In those ages old
They feasted well upon well-won gold,
And of charity were not chary :
They lived great lives, and helped their neighbours,
And this was the motto of their labours,
Laborare est orare.
A dinner is good, saith the Prophet Punch,
If not too greedily people munch:
But the diners and money-scrapers
Might feel that a spot of garden-soil,
In the very heart of the City of Toil,
Should have sacred been kept by the Drapers.

PILGRIMS, NOW AND THEN!
In the days when of yore Pilgrims took up their staves
To ask intercession of Saints in their graves,
When they sailed the salt seas with no steamers to aid,
And walked the rough roads, before railways were laid ;
When Holy Land journeys were made without Cooks,
When mankind had no MURRAYS and hands had no books,
When the robber kept highway instead of hotel,
And his prey bled in purse, and in person as well ;
When a Pilgrim who forth to The Sepulchre fared,
Ten to one, on the way found his own grave prepared ;
When he faced thirst and hunger with scant scrip and cruise,
And for hard walking need put no peas in his shoes ;
For the pious to go on a pilgrimage meant
More than rattling by railway through Sussex or Kent,
To Newhaven or Dover pier-gangway, and then
Their accounts with old Neptune arranging like men;
Then a scramble ashore, run to Paris by rail,
Through buffet-extortionists, out of Church pale,'.
With six in a carriage, and noddles that swim
'Twixt sea-sickness and sentiment, guide-book and hymn.
All this, and the squeeze at the Station du Nord-
For Pilgrims' “bagages" must be searched, though a bore--
And the bother for bed-rooms, and struggling for chairs,
In Not' Dame Des Victoires, for before-breakfast prayers;
Then more rail to St. Florentin, and that hot dragi :
A la fin to Pontigny, with banner and flag,
And the pealing of chaunts, hymns, and litanies long-
(For the weaker our ranks the more need to sing strong)
All this makes a hardish excursion, I see-
But a pilgrimage-such as the thing used to be!
Allow for sea-sickness, hotel-bills and all,
· And gammon and spinach the business I call.
And just as your pilgrimage, smoothly railed o'er,
To that which the Pilgrim encountered of yore,
Is the faith that prompts you, to the faith that urged him :
His as child-like and clear, as yours doubtful and dim.
If blindly he followed the best guides he knew,
There was no one to show him his guides were blind too:
He did not from light turn, delib'rate, away,
Nor read Reason's guide-post, and then go astray.
He believed Priests could pardon, and Popes could condemn;
That Rome's Keys hung from Heaven, and that Crowns hung
from them ;
That the Church kept the toll-gate betwixt God and Man-
Which without the Pope's ticket let those clear that can!
So a Pilgrim he went where the Church bade him go,
To buy the indulgence the Church could bestow,
By payment of money, and masses, and toil,
To wash moral blackamoors white of their soil.
But you—is it kinder or harsher to deem
Your belief a belief, or the dream of a dream ?
'Tis a sore task for Charity's self to conceive
That what you profess to believe you believe.
Yet Charity holds 'tis in earnest you call
On all who'd be saved to your fetish to fall;
That some of you go to the Pontigny grave
In good faith that its bones have some magic to save;
Strange as it may seem, in these days you hold true
That a dead man's good works can, in some way, help you;
That the savour diffused by their prayers that are gone
Breathes up in a blessing from shrine and from stone !
Well-in days when faith scarce goes beyond gold and beef,
'Tis cruel to quarrel with too much beliet-
In all things well intended some good there may be
In a pilgrimage even, St. Edmund, to thee !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A PILGRIM ON HIS PATH.
SENSATION has been excited by the subjoined an-
nouncement in a report of the Pontigny Pilgrimage:-
“It may be worth while to notice that last night, in his
sermon to the Pilgrims assembled in full force at the pro-
Cathedral, Kensington, MONSIGNOR PATTERSON informed his
hearers that he had received a letter from a very high dignitary
of the Anglican Establishment,' conveying his warm sympathy
and good wishes for their undertaking.”
Who could this have been? DR. PUSEY is not a dig-
nitary of the Anglican Establishment at all; ARCHDEA-
CON DENISON is not a very high one. Therefore, the
letter received by MONSIGNOR PATTERSON cannot indicate
that either ARCHDEACON DENISON or DR. PUSEY is about
to follow MONSIGNOR PATTERSON. MONSIGNOR PATTER-
SON was a Clergyman of the Church of England. He
became convinced of the tenets avowed by the Ritualists,
and he kept a conscience. So, no doubt, does MONSIGNOR
PATTERSON'S correspondent. His heart was with the
Pilgrims on their way to Pontigny, and he did not
actually join them of course only because he was just
then on the point of going over to Rome. If he has not
gone it's a pity, and the sooner he goes the better.

DISRAELI on Circuit. Let's hope no despatches
His pleasant track follow, to bore him at morn :
For well he deserves the repose that he snatches,
Pausing now in the steep upward path he has worn.
The wonderful dreams of unscrupulous Vivian,
The dashing young Duke, who became a Lothair :
These sumptuous visions can't rest in oblivion,
As our BENJAMIN talks to the wise and the fair.
We think of him oft, in a library cradled,
Mixing letters with pap in a curious shape,
Then by ROGERS with sterling divinity ladled,
And choosing the Angel instead of the Ape.
By force mixed with tact he has reached the high summit
Of power in the world, which men strive for in vain;
But he measures the depth far below with a plummet
Of genius, and treats it with quiet disdain.
For he is not ambitious, as men take ambition,
Knowing perfectly well the full power that he wields,
And he likes just to look upon life as a vision,
And the gardens of Dukes as Elysian Fields.
A Premier who saunters and gossips and glitters,
Has an epigram ready for any girl-rose,
Marks the sunset that blushes, the red-breast that twitters,
Deserves, Punch declares, his autumnal repose.
For him, while from county to county he's vagrant,
Wherever caprice may incline him to go,
May the claret be sound and the pineapples fragrant,
And the pretty girls Tories from chignon to toe!

CONVERSION IN HIGH LIFE.
The following remarks, in the Bien Public of Ghent,
should have appeared under the above heading :
"The conversion of LORD RIPON appears to us, in the midst of
the mourning of the Church, persecuted in its chief and its mis.
sion, as a symptom full of consolation and hope. It will be a
balm for the heart of PiuS THE NINTH, it will also be a true
joy for all Catholics. From more than one heart prayers will
rise to heaven for the new convert and that noble country of
England, where, among the ruins heaped up by the heresy of
HENRY THE EIGHTH, one sees a rising harvest which will recall
to the astonished eyes of our sceptical generations the glorious
fecundity of the Isle of Saints."
The Bien Public is said to be the organ of the Jesuits.
It expresses the sentiments of a kind of persons who
“dearly love a lord.” Are there Jesuits of that order ?
Their reputed organ evinces a valuation of a lord which
is quite American. Do Jesuits love and value a lord at
this rate? Have disciples of IGNATIUS LOYOLA a respect
for a Peer equal even to that usually evinced on occasion
by citizens of the United States ? To be sure they may
value the lord rather than love him. They may exult
in having caught a live lord, not as respecters of per-
sons, who think any more of catching a lord than they
would of catching a beggar, but because they imagine
that, in having caught a lord, they have caught a good
decoy-duck. Let us charitably adopt that view of the
case, and give the Jesuits credit for worldly wisdom,
rather than suppose the foregoing quotation an example
of Jesuitism combined with flunkeyism in the proportion
of half and half. Be that as it may, the lord-loving
Bien Public might take for its motto “ In domino con-

Now the long shadows of September come,
And idle for a time the scribbler's pen is,
He passes from the Town's discordant hum,
From garrulous gossip of the kettle-drum,
From orators who should have been born dumb,
To watch upon green lawn the girls play tennis.
Robins are trilling in the faded trees,
The flitting swallows of their voyage chatter,
Testing their wings before they dare the seas,
For Nile's dun marge or blue-girt Cyclades ;
The sportsman's shots come frequent on the breeze,
The flying balls keep up a pleasant clatter.
Croquet's a merry game for those who flirt

But Tennis, when the ladies are alert,
Follow the swift ball with a looped-up skirt,
Strike it on high with graceful arm expert,
Burns up the masculine heart with sudden arson.
So, pour some icy fluid in a glass
Tinged with deep mulberry stain, true work of Venice:
And Mr. Punch will let the soft hours pass,
Watching with tranquil eyes each lovely lass
Flit like an Oread * v'er the smooth green grass,
And win his old heart as she wins at Tennis.

A MASK ON MEANING.
ACCORDING to the Globe-
“CARDINAL CULLEY has issued a Pastoral to the Dublin Clergy urging
prayer for the ‘Pope, now a captive in Rome,' and for the Church, which he
holds to be menaced by philosophy under the mask of science.'”
Philosophy under the mask of science must wear a mask very
much like its own face. Humility under the mask of meekness,
hypocrisy under the mask of deceit, superstition under the mask of
credulity, would wear masks of the same description. For the
purpose of attacking the Church, science might as well wear the
mask of philosophy as philosophy the mask of science. Which
does CARDINAL CULLEN consider the greater enemy of the Church,
science or philosophy ? Irreligion might attack the Church under
the mask of science, just as love of rule might attack liberty under
the mask of religion. Does his Eminence identify philosophy with
irreligion? The Cardinal effectually conceals meaning under the
mask of expression.

ANOTHER EXHIBITION.
THE success that has attended the Busy
Bee Show at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham,
has suggested the idea that an Exhibition
of Working Men might be made not only
amusing but instructive. Should the
motion come to anything, the following
Classes will probably be included in the list
of those competing for prizes. Members of
the International Working Men's Congress,
and other kindred societies, should, for
obvious reasons, be admitted as Visitors to
the proposed excellent exhibition without
charge :-
Class 1. Public Servants.--For Cabinet
Ministers and other Members of the Govern-
ment Service, whose hours of labour are
often from eight in the morning of one
day, until three A.m. of the day following:
Class 2. Literary Men.-For Journalists
whose toil knows no ending, for Novelists
who frequently have to write two romances
for the Magazines at the time that they are
finishing tales in three volumes for their
own publishers; and for Dramatists' who
have to rehearse all day what they are
engaged in writing all night.
1. Class 3. Clergymen.-For men with re-
fined tastes and educated minds, who have
to spend their week-days in visits to the
poor and the sick, and their Sundays in
hard labour in the pulpit.
Class 4. Doctors.-For men of science,
who cannot call a single hour of their lives
their own, and are ever at the service of
their snffering fellow-creatures.

Why to run down my poor little tunes you incline,

not want boots for this tour ?
Well, as he is making a list of what he does want, he may as
well put down boots. The list shall be alphabetical, and boots come
under “B.” Good. Bradshaw and Boots both under "B."
Nothing like method. But there ought to be something to put
under “X," so as to start fair.
The Club friend says, “I haven't been to Switzerland for ages.
It strikes him at once like an inspiration. Switzerland be it.
Geneva for choice.”
The next name (while looking out Geneva) that strikes him is
Cook. COOK's ticket! Some one has told him that “A COOK's
ticket” saves all trouble. Hitherto the name sounded somewhat
like that old familiar phrase “A ticket for soup.” He makes up
his mind, as far as an Intending Tourist can make up his mind, that
a Cook's ticket is the thing.
Now, then, “B” Bradshaw help me to “C” Cook.
Here are two young Ladies, in fashionable head-gear, who came

ma and sat in front of him.
Refer to 824, 825. Not a word about Cook. The pages in question
are occupied by advertisements, including a picture of a dressing-
bag, and a gentleman in a surgical belt.
The Dressing-bag at once suggests the idea. The Tourist does
want a nice handy bag. It's the very thing of all others. Put it
down as a mem. under “D” for Dressing-bag. The memoranda
now are: A-Nothing at present. B-Bradshaw (to buy one).
C-Cook (to inquire about him). D-Dressing-bag (to call and see
different sorts).
It may be Continental Bradshaw's joke, but at pp. 824, 825, there
is not one word about Cook.
The Tourist understands his friend to say that Neufchâtel is a
good point to make for.
He looks out “Neufchâtel” in Bradshau.
It troubles him seriously to find it, not in Switzerland, but France.
Yet he will swear, to the best of his knowledge and belief, that
when he was eleven years old, Neufchâtel was in Switzerland.
Perhaps the tel at the end of it got confounded in his mind with
the WILLIAM who had TELL at the end of his Christian name.
Neufchâtel is not the cheese place, surely, or if it is,-- Well, one
lives and learns Bradshaw, and owns one's ignorance. It is startling
for the Tourist to discover that Neufchâtel is the next station to
Dieppe, and that he has been there without knowing it.
But no, this can't be his, the Tourist's, Neufchâtel, the Neufchâtel
that he fondly supposed and hoped was in Switzerland, where merry
Swiss boys played on merry Swiss pipes to merry Swiss maids as
they milked merry Swiss cows and carried merry Swiss pails on the

(A Lay of Temple Bar in its present state, September, 1874–with grateful
remembrance of MR. KINGSLEY'S “ Three Fishers.")
THREE gourmands invited were into the West,
Out of Cornhill, by LORD FITZ-BROWN ;
They found they'd be late, and they thought it best
From Cheapside to cab it right into Town.
“For men will growl and women will weep,
If waiting for dinner my Lord we keep !"
Near Temple Bar they're moaning.
They were blocked up in Fleet Street for nigh an hour,
___And the lamps were lit as the sun went down ;
They swore they'd walk, but there came a show'r:
'Twas long past the hour for LORD FITZ-BROWN.
For cabs must walk and 'busses must creep,
Which causes a block from Fleet to Chepe,
While the Temple Bar is moaning.
Three "empties” drew up at Fitz-BROWN's house grand,
As the Devonshire cream and the tart went down;
And the ladies are smiling behind the hand
As the “empties” explain to LORD FITZ-BROWN.
While cabs must crawl and 'busses must creep,
All long to say, from Fleet to Chepe,
“0, good-bye to the Bar and its moaning !”
STATISTICS OF CONSCIENCE.
FROM official accounts which have just been issued, it appears
that in the financial year ended the 31st of March last, the remit-
tances forwarded to the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER as con-
science-money amounted to no less than £8,588 7s. 11d. This is a
good deal of money, and represents a considerable quantity of con-
science. But it can stand for only a small part of the conscience of
the community. How many persons are there who, having con-
science enough to make them pay their taxes at once to the tax-
gatherer, have no occasion to send conscience-money to the
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER? Doubtless, if their aggregate
conscience could be represented by figures, comprising all the taxes
they could evade if they chose, the sum of its pecuniary expression
would be a plurality of millions, and afford a gratifying proof of
the number, the wealth, and the conscientiousness of those British
taxpayers who can afford to keep a conscience, and do. That is to
say, who do keep a conscience, and don't do the Government andi
the nation.

of their friend SIR WILFRID LAWSON. Å select circle of

Past Master of the Grand Lodge of Good Templars, and
the Chairman of the Licensed Victuallers' Defence Asso-

a cask of goodly home-brewed should be always kept
on tap at the Park Lodge, which being a trifle over
three miles from their bed-rooms, will in no wise con-
travene the law respecting bona fide travellers.
MR. AYRTON is at present sojourning at Athens, where
he is busily engaged in the collection of materials for his
long meditated lectures upon Ancient Art.
The MARQUIS OF RIPON has just set forth on a pil-
grimage to Paray-le-Monial, in company with MR.
NEWDEGATE and the Rev. C. H. SPURGEON: the former
carrying a score of unboiled peas in his left boot, and

We notice yearly more and more that during the dull season certain journals
fill some inches of their valuable space by reporting the movements of the
Members of the Government, and, moreover, those of any gentlemen in Parlia-
ment who have happened to become conspicuous in debate. Not to be behind-
hand in conforming with the fashion of the age, we beg leave to furnish a few
details of this sort; although we altogether question the propriety of publishing
the private acts and pastimes of any public men.
MR. GLADSTONE has just started on a journey to the East, for the purpose of
examining the various claims advanced by several ancient cities to have been
the actual birthplace of the poet he so loves. Ere leaving home he stated to a
confidential friend that he saw three courses open ; namely, (1) To go at once ;
(2) to put off going; or (3) not to go at all: and, after a protracted mental con-
flict with himself, he finally decided in favour of the first.
MR. DISRAELI has been summoned on a visit to Balmoral, that he may have
the honour of submitting to HER MAJESTY a scheme he has concocted, with the
aid of CANON KINGSLEY, for severing the connection between the English State
and Church.
MR. LOWE is going through a rigid course of training, to prepare himself for
making a bicycle excursion from the end of Dover Pier to the door of John o'
Groat's House. He rises every morning at four o'clock precisely, swallows five
raw eggs mixed with a cup of rum and milk, mounts his bicycle and whirls off
at full speed, round and round his little grassplot, until eight o'clock; then
bathes, and eats for breakfast a pint of oatmeal porridge and a pound of raw
beefsteak; smokes a pipe and reads his newspaper till ten, practises the dumb-
bell exercise till noon, answers letters before lunching sparingly at one, and
whirls away again until he hears the second dinner-bell at half-past six o'clock.
The MARQUIS OF SALISBURY is out yachting in the Channel, in company with
MR. BRADLAUGH and MR. BERNAL OSBORNE, the latter costumed in the character
of Long Tom Coffin in the Pilot, as performed with such success by the late MR.

Often people ask :
Something may be taught 'em
If they like the task.
Follow not the pheasant-
Frivolous affair;
Wisdom 's effervescent
In Congress everywhere.
Pundits Oriental
Give us Sanskrit puns ;
They are ornamental-
Looking sons of guns :
They can talk in Tamil,
'Mid many other feats ;
Why don't they ride the camel
Through our sober streets ?
Congress of Fungologists-
Toadstool-eating men,
Who appear apologists
For aught that grows in glen.
Punch of no such rueful
Fungi will partake;
In pâté give him truffle,
And mushrooms with his steak.
The Congress scientific
Must bore us, just a bit;
Its sopor-sudor-ific
Results, we all admit.
The Congress Mr. Punch is
More willing far to share
Involves the best of lunches
In bright October air.
It puts an end to troubles,
And brings a calm repose,
The wine that briskly bubbles,
The wit that freely flows,
The pungence of a salad,
The laughter of the young,
The music of a ballad
By red lips gaily sung.
'Twixt politics and science
The year is taken up:
At both Punch hurls defiance,
And means to drink his " cup;"
Leave savans to their tall ways,
And saints to their repose;
Hold Autumn Congress always
Of the nicest girls he knows.

LEASE observe that this, the companion
volume to Things a Lady Would Like

knowledge, giving information on
many topics like the following :-
1. On whose heads the hair first
grew which is manufactured into her charming
chignons.
2. Of what chemicals are made her perfumes,
essences, hair-dyes, and washes for beautifying the
complexion.
3. What (she being a lovely blonde) LORD MIL-
LION's eldest son, whom she had almost caught, said about her to the wicked little brunette with whom he waltzed so often the other night.
4. Why her husband is so willing that she should enjoy herself for a few weeks at Brighton, though he has so much business that he
can only come down on Saturdays.
5. What the children are learning while the governess writes her love-letters.
6. What the servants think of the correspondence which she carelessly leaves about.
7. Why the fascinating CAPTAIN FITZ-PYRAMID, who is always bringing opera-boxes and bouquets, will let her husband induce him
to waste so much time on billiards.
From these examples it is clear that the book in question is one which should never be absent from any Lady's boudoir. Its negative

THE light, so long trimmed by a hand severe,
· Dies grave and gradual, without flash or flare,-
No storm cuts short the radiance calm and clear,
That ne'er showed doubtful but when skies were fair.
To the last drop of oil had burned the light
That shone ere sun-rise, after midnight mirk,
Ere to the life-long student came the night
That comes to all—“wherein no man can work.”
With such stern humour as his nature deigned,
He chose, for coat-of-arms, a rigid bar;
For motto,“ straight line shortest,” and so trained
His spirit for its work of peace or war.
Strange irony of Heavenly rule that he
Who knew least cloud in creed, least doubt in school,
Least laxity in life, was doomed to be
Such People's minister, such Sovereign's tool !
Rigid, right-minded, clear as keen of ken,
The student's, teacher's, step was straight and strong,
About the dusty ways of bye-gone men,
No path too dark for him, no search too long.
High, to a wider class than his Sorbonne,
His firm hand held the guiding light, to show
Out of Rome's dust, slow-shapen, one by one,
New nations gather, and new orders grow.
All reverenced the teacher, from whose chair
Truth's trumpet gave forth no uncertain sound;
And when professor's gown for statesman's wear
Was changed, men deemed a better time come round.
All knew him learned, high of life as thought,
As eloquent of speech as keen of pen,
And few but fancied, “he that so has wrought
Wisdom from books, must needs work good from men.”
Ah me, blind hearts of all from woman born!
The teacher that we knew so pure, so proud,
So strong in his own strength, so full of scorn,
For others' weakness, mingling with the crowd,
Stooped to their littleness his stately port,
Content, so his hands showed no sordid soil :
A mean king's mean grace not too high to court,
He stood by silent while knaves shared their spoil,
Deeming untempered mortar good enough
For buildings reared on sands of trick and turn;
Till, when the wind rose, and the sea waxed rough,
And at the crumbling basement 'gan to spurn,
It found not strength above, nor stay below,
But all, a rotten ruin, toppled down,
Sweeping away, in sudden overthrow,
Minister, measures, Cabinet, and Crown.
And when, stunned and bewildered, he, the chief,
Who had misjudged, misordered, things and men,
Struggled back to his feet, he sought relief
Where lay his strength, in thoughts and books and pen,
And was again the man of his first fame,
The father, sage, philosopher and guide,
For whom each day found its day's work-a name
For reverence, love and honour, far and wide.

Would three bottles leave him sober ?

Of that primal ship the Argo :

On a grand cock-pheasant rising,

And his noble memory drink
When the skies grow amber.

BISMARCK’S MASTER MIND.
ALTHOUGH inflexible, if necessary, in pursuing a foreign'policy of
"blood and iron," PRINCE BISMARCK in domestic life can unbend.
The other day, at Varzin, he gave all his farm-servants, male and
female, a grand feast, followed by a ball in celebration of harvest-
home. Soon after the waltzing bad commenced, the Prince and his
Princess entered the saloon, and joined in the festivities. The
Princess “danced with one of the labourers once, and then played
the part of a spectator.” But as for BISMARCK himself:--
“The Prince danced with all the girls on his estate, but not until he had
given his first partner a lesson in the art.'
This incident is mentioned in a piece of news under heading of
“PRINCE BISMARCK At Home.” It shows him at home in the
capacity of a dancing-master. Thus BISMARCK is proved to be
more of a master mind even than he is reputed. From his having
danced with all the girls on his estate, it is evident that he is an
indefatigable dancer. Who has ever dreamt that PRINCE BISMARCK
would remind him of SIR CHRISTOPHER HATTON? Yet if QUEEN
ELIZABETH had a dancing Chancellor, so, it appears, has EMPEROR

And read the records writ on flint and granite,
They must be ready for whate'ér reply

TONGUE V. TRADE.
How great would be the wonder of our Honourable
Legislators, were a Petition to be signed by our leading
Merchant Princes, praying that the opening of next
Session be postponed, say, till next summer, on the
ground that talking politics sadly injured trade! Yet,
so far as we can learn, nobody seems startled by this
scrap of Paris news:-
"A petition has been signed by the Merchants of Paris,
praying the National Assembly not to meet before the 15th of
January, in order to avoid exercising an unfavourable political
influence on the trade of the country at the close of the year.”
A petition such as this 'seems rather a bad compli-
ment to the honourable gentlemen who compose the
French Assembly, and who, be it borne in mind, are
paid a handsome salary for the service which they are
supposed to render to the State. If the influence of their
meeting be injurious to trade, one wonders that La
France should retain them in her service, and still more
that she consents to retain them in her pay. Or it
might be worth her while to increase their yearly in-
come, on condition only that they did her the great
service of abstaining from all speech-making, and living
peaceably in silence, as far as for a Frenchman that may
be possible, at home.
A Puzzling Announcement.
FRIENDS, Ladies, Housekeepers, lend us your eyes, to
look at this advertisement:
W ANTED, a GIRL, about 16 ; need not have been out ;
VV for titled family.
One may presume that this young person is wanted in
the kitchen, but, for aught that one can gather, she may
rather be required for social service in the drawing-room.
Perhaps the titled family may be wishful to adopt her,
and intend to bring her out if she has not yet been so
brought. There is no mention made of wages, or any-
thing of that sort: but admission to the house of a
family of title may be esteemed full compensation for
"MAKING THE BEST OF IT."

So, Physician and Prophet, though welcoming you,
Mr. Punch doesn't think you teach anything new,
And holds that your sayings may make men litigious,
But will give them no help to be truly religious.
The Church of our realm has a glorious basis
In the faith of the people, and scorns all grimaces :
Nothing new, DR. G., what you come to prescribe is,
In mediâ viâ tutissimus ibis.
MR. GLADSTONE ON RITUAL.
PHYSICIAN and Prophet, you write with a will
From your quiet retreat in Llandudno or Rhyl,
And the wicked world, given to excesses habitual,
Is warned by your eloquent sayings on Ritual.
Three courses there are which you carefully touch:
There may be too little, there may be too much;
What's precisely enough only trial can tell-
This prescription applies to one's Cognac as well.
The point that you miss is to most people clear:
SACERDOS should ask himself—“Why am I here?
To wear whimsical finery, radiant and rare,
Or to teach the true meaning of duty and prayer ?
Our stolid strong world is in some things obdurate,
And laughs at the silly caprice of the curate;
And even a GLADSTONE will labour in vain
To prove that excitement is good for the brain.
With music and painting to glorify God
Is a noble desire; but contemptibly odd
Is the notion, from Romanist policy caught,
Of exalting these Arts to the loss of true thought.
Our GLADSTONE, spoilt child of the nation, might see
That England is strong because England is free,
And that ferment of fierce theological yeast
Will ne'er put JOHN BULL under power of the Priest.
We think rather slowly: the heterodox
May laugh at the grave old strong sire of the ox:
But he waits till the fever of phantasy cools,
Knowing Premiers and Petticoats both may be fools.
A BLUE-BOOK WITH A ROSE TINGE.
READ the Third Annual Report of the Local Government Board
for 1873-74. In the midst of that vast blue-book of seven hundred
pages there is a bit of motherly writing by Mrs. NASSAU SENIOR,
which is delightful to read, and cannot fail to be of immense use.
MRS. SENIOR has visited pauper schools, and has traced about seven
hundred girls who had been educated at pauper schools; and her
brief biographies of these poor little waifs are perfect in their
simplicity. She believes that the Poor Law system will, in time,
come to an end through improvement in education. Mr. Punch is
not so sanguine. Tous Trucows gàs TávToti Zitt ri8 lautêv. Mendicity
is eternal. But the pauper may be gradually raised to a higher
level: and such an inquiry as MRS. SENIOR's is likely to do great
good in this way.
Mr. Punch is delighted when a lady does in this direction what
no man could possibly do. The terse memoirs of these poor little
pauper maids are much more pathetic than anything in modern
fiction. We trace the poor children from place to place-we see
them stunted, sulky, squinting, suffering from ophthalmia, the very
refuse of the world. MRS. SENIOR, kind and keen in her investiga-
tions, tells the Guardians of the Poor (who too often deem them-
selves mere guardians of the rate-payers) how they may gradually
diminish this evil. MR. STANSFELD did a wise thing when he asked
her to undertake the inquiry: if the lessons of it are rightly read,
| her second contribution to the blue-book will have a far rosier tinge.

meant pretty much what I had been saying, so I got her to write it
down for me, and here it is :-

paroles." -Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.
Now that's just that the French do with marshay. I hadn't

anything wouldn't do what it was intended to do, it was because it

marshay. If the kitchen stove wouldn't burn, through Cook having
shut all the dampers, it wouldn't marshay. When Master's razors
wanted setting he told me to take them to the barber's, about two
miles off, and tell him that they wouldn't marshay, and must be
raccommodaied. And so they were, and they've marshayed ever
since; at least, you'd say so if you looked at Master, for he's
shaved as clean as a Clown in a pantomime.
The first morning at breakfast Mistress announced that none of
the bells would marshay ; but I can't say I troubled myself much
about that. “That's the kind of bells' stratagem as suits me,"
I said. By dinner time we had found out that none of the locks
on the doors would marshay; and that night Cook and I, in fear of
our lives, didn't dare to go to sleep until we had piled the water-jug,
two basins, and a foot-bath against our door.
Next morning (it was very dry weather) some one came in to say
that the pump wouldn't marshay, and the very next day we were
told that the cow, which was let to us with the premises, had broken
down, and couldn't marshay any longer.
“Good gracious!” I said, when I heard this. “Why she must
be an English cow! How natural of her to break down along with
the pump. How well these dumb animals know their friends and

There was nobody near who could speak English, and, for a time,
it was as much as Mistress and Miss EDITH (our eldest) could do to
keep us straight with the Booshay and the Boolonjay. And, what
struck me most at first was the deal of use that the French make of
two or three words. Now, there's that wonderful word marshay.
Why, it's equal to a dictionary! I happened to say so to Miss

And the suction of eggs to my grandmother taught;

CASSANDRA was a Prophetess
Of credit and renown;
KING PRIAM's daughter eke was she
In famous old Troy town.
Ah, ladies in those ancient days
Sometimes made trivial slips :
Bribed by the gift of prophecy,
She kissed Apollo's lips.
But, being something of a flirt,
Poor Phoebus she deceived ;
So after, when she prophesied,
Why, nobody believed.
Who 'a think an English essayist,
Who wants to kill our joy,
Would wear the very petticoats
That Princess wore in Troy?
One SCHLIEMANN dug them from the soil,
Hid in a nectar-keg,
And by the hand of MR. Cook
Sent them to MR. GREG.
Now MR. GREG, he prophesies-
A melancholy soul-
That soon we shall be deep in debt,
And very short of coal.
He also says that down the hill
Must slide each Christian sect,
Since Christianity won't suit
The highest intellect.
And even a sadder sight he sees

CRYSTAL CONCERTS.
Now that the delightful Winter Concerts have begun,
men with music in their souls cannot do better with their
bodies on a Saturday than take them down to Sydenham,
between luncheon time and dinner. Many may prefer
the music of the whirring of the partridge, as it rises
from the turnips, or the rustling of the pheasant, as it
scrambles through the brakes. But men are not all
murderous : and some may better like to hear the beating
of a drum than the banging of a breechloader, or the
scraping of a fiddle than the yelping of a fox-hound.
At these Concerts MR. GROVE is still the principal
composer—that is, of the notes which vivify the pro-
gramme: and when he exults in singing praises of
BEETHOVEN, he speaks out truly from his heart, and
must not be confounded with the Groves of Blarney.
Shunning prudently the clap-trap of critical slangó-
graphy, he is an eloquent exponent of the beauties of
good music, and, for the benefit of ignoramuses in the art,
expounds its charms with elegant simplicity of language.
Moreover, as another magnet of attraction, MR. MANNS
conducts right manfully, or, if you like, right Manns-
fully. Not an omnibus in London boasts a cleverer
conductor. Practice makes perfect, say the copybooks
at school; and, by dint of daily practice, his band is now
as perfect as any one in Europe. With the careful aid
aforesaid, his programmes are the models of a musical
menu. Like a skilful chef, while catering for widely
varying tastes, he prudently abstains from monotony of
flavour. Assuredly, if music be the food of Love, Cupid
never need go fasting at the Crystal Palace.
A Famine Indeed.
An incident which has occurred in the experience of a
Preceptor, will doubtless occur repeatedly in that of
other Preceptors. According to a Book :-

THE SACERDOTAL PRINCIPLE.
COLERIDGE, poetic layman, taught the Church
Great truths in days gone by: another son
Of the same brilliant line, is fain to perch
On laic pulpit, where distinction's won
By breaking down the Sacerdotal bar,
And teaching Clergymen what fools they are.
The Sacerdotal Principle he dreads,
But cannot quite define it. Wherefore so ?
Bos, fur, sacerdos, aimed at priestly heads,
Became a stale quotation, long ago:
And ribald haters of the ascetic priest
Declared the M.B. waistcoat “marked the beast."
Yet, though there often is a craze for Ritual,
Among young Curates (who with croquet mix it),
'Tis folly to imagine it habitual:
Religion stable is, but Fashion tricks it,
Develops what the Puritans thought horrid,
And makes the_Service, like the Minster, florid.
The Church to-day is not a whit in danger,
In the free people's common-sense its trust is;
It need not fear the Nonconformist ranger,
Nor dread foreboding of the Lord Chief Justice :
It gave us learning, freedom, by degrees
These are the commonest of its Common Pleas.
So, if a few young Parsons play queer games,
Now they are bound in a parochial cordon ;
If, to shut up their semi-Romish aims,
There's need of the parishioners' Churchwarden,
Still make not every boyish priest a martyr-

“The harvest feast afterwards took place, and the celebration concluded
with a Musical Entertainment, in which the Magic Lantern played a part."
As it was only a part that the Magic Lantern is represented as
having played in a Concert, it can hardly be supposed to have played

LABOURERS IN DEVON.
The fine Old Devonshire Labourer
Is coming forward now;
He seems resolved to make a stir,
This driver of the plough ;
He's tired of sourish cider
And weekly “bob" eleven,
And he hears the world is wider
Than the pleasant shire of Devon.
So out he comes, Jan LACLAND,
To speechify and listen ;
And good SIR THOMAS ACLAND
Gives him a room of his'n:
He tells his sorrows and strong dislikes,
And looks uncommon blue,
Grumbling away till midnight strikes-
Punch hopes he won't strike too.
“ We finds all things are dearer
Except 'tis sugar and tea,
And to give a man a cheerer,
Why, what be they to we
Us can't get a mossel of roast beef
On Sundays for to carve;
Us thinks it mean to set up a machine,
And let poor labourers starve.”
It is the old, sad story;
But the Demagogue makes things worse,
When, for pay or for paltry glory,
He acts as a travelling ourse.
The man who rants and clamours and cants
Is a downright plague and pest:
Pity that fools who have failed in the East
Should carry the war to the West.
Ecclesiastical Divisions.
In the late Triennial Convention of the American
Episcopalian Church, proceedings, the other day, began
with the consideration of a petition from the Church
of New Jersey, asking that this diocese should be divided
in two." The diocese of New Jersey differs remarkably
from all the dioceses of Old England. It is not divided
into two yet. But, comprising High, Low, and Broad
Church parties, every one of our own dioceses has been
for some time divided at least into three.

I'm compared to a hero whose special vocation
Was mowing the chin.
'Twas at Seville he exercised his occupation-
My shop's at Berlin.
I, too, customers shave, but in my work I deal,
You're aware, not precisely with lather and steel ;
Though, for one thing, through Iron my purpose I win.
I'm the Figaro ! I am the general factotum
In Europe's affairs-.
Say the journals at large and the people who quote 'em.
No such nest as a Mare's !
They imagine me gifted with Old Nick's ubiquity,
Ever plotting all manner of schemes of iniquity,
Digging my pitfalls and setting my snares.
They detect me in Paris in this intrigue lurking-
In that at Madrid :
At Vienna, at Rome, at St. Petersburg working,
Getting done what I bid.
Be the fact what it may, 'tis no use to deny
That I have a finger in every pie-
Like a snake in the grass while I keep myself hid.
KNAVES?
Thus that valuable record of letters, the Athenæum :-
“Messrs. DE LA RUE will issue this season a pack of novel playing-cards,
in which historical personages of the present time are introduced as the
honours."
Charming idea! Mr. Punch has been informed by a contem-
porary novelist that in medieval packs of cards the honours were
great Princes, painted by great Italian painters. It will be a good
thing to resuscitate this custom : one's game of Ecarté or Whist will
be improved if one sometimes comes across HER MAJESTY as Queen.
Kings and Queens are plentiful enough; ay, even Emperors and
| Empresses ; but where in the world will MESSRS. DE LA RUE's artist
get his knayes ? Are there any among “historical personages of
the present time"? Let him search “ the Court, the Camp, the
Grove”-not to mention the Stock Exchange and similar haunts of
historical personages—and he will not come upon a single "fool
with a circumbendibus." We are “all honourable men," as the
LORD MAYOR says. Mr. Punch thereat rejoices; but he does not
see how he is to play Whist with these “novel” cards if the Knaves
are necessarily omitted.
'Tis a shame ; for I never did aught under-handed,
I truly may say.
I am sure that I ålways have shown myself candid-
As open as day.
'Tis my custom to speak the plain truth with audacity,
If diplomatists will disbelieve my veracity-
Why, I take that to be the more excellent way.
Something New.
“ The Leader, an organ of advanced thought in Politics, Literature, Re-
ligion, Music, and Art, will, it is stated, shortly be issued.”
THE bare announcement of the name of the new Journal would
have been misleading. Without the explanation of its scope, as
given in the paragraph quoted above, from the Echo, readers might
have fairly supposed that the Leader was going to be a sporting
paper, and in an especial manner the chronicle of four-in-hands,
and four-horse stage-coaches.

With the utilitarian Seer to quarrel;
Glaciers will slide, and greedy tigers munch-
Is this why old Dame Nature seems immoral ?
Is it not possible, sagacious MILL,
That these great blunders of the cosmic forces
Would seem result of an Omniscient skill,
If philosophic brains had more resources ?
You portray Nature as a merry minx,
Adorn her with a philosophic necklace :
Is she not rather an unfathomed Sphinx,
Whose riddles men too fain to solve are reckless ?
But why immoral? O the foolish dream
Of the slow thinker, to whom sunset glory,
Blush of the rose, and silver of the stream
Can teach no wisdom, and can tell no story?
Nature is God's machine-a perfect thing
Which does its work, though scientists degenerate :
The avalanche will crush, the wasp will sting-
The philosophic idiot will not venerate.
That same philosopher his teeth will grind
Over his theme, as baby over coral:
If he were wise enough, he soon would find
Himself chief proof that Nature is immoral.

And strive to banish Jute and lyre

Wherefore, O Dean, this change of fashions ?
Has Music now revived the passions ?
Is it a back-recoiling fear
Lest song than sermon prove more dear ?
Or does a too cacophonous clangour
In decanal ear arouse some anger ?
Or is it possibly despair
Of rivalling Music anywhere'?
Or thinks the Dean that nothing's holy
If severed from pale Melancholy?
The list 's too long to investigate-
It may be love, it can't be hate;.
But clearly, Worcester's fair Cathedral
Is ruled by men with polyhedral

To hurt the Church than such a Chapter.
Please reconsider, Mr. Dean!
The people like the pleasant scene,

Music that touches him to tears,

The papers announce that KING CACOBAU, Ex-monarch of Fiji,
has gone to Australia. Before he sailed he did a good thing.
LORD CARNARVON informs us that he has received a telegram from
SIR HERCULES ROBINSON, mentioning that
“KING THACKOMBAU bas had his favourite war-club elaborately orna-
mented in silver with emblems of Peace, and has sent it to the QUEEN, with
a dutiful message, confiding the interests of his people unreservedly to the
justice and generosity of HER MAJESTY.”
Which is the right spelling of his Fijian ex-Majesty's name,
CACOBad or THACKOMBAU ? Or, is it possible that its genuine
orthography is WHACK'EMBAU, hé having acquired that appellation
by his prowess in the use of the favourite war-club which he has
now resigned ? Would that all the Sovereigns of the great European

“SUBURBAN QUIET.”
SUBURBAN quiet! Futile dream-
Though lofty palisades may seem
To hide your pleasant villa,
Yet all day long the crowd of tramps,
Of pestering hucksters, thievish scamps,
Will worry your ancilla.
The sailor comes with wooden leg,
And seems to bluster more than beg,
He thinks no answer final;
He swears he fought at Trafalgar,
And spoils your early mild cigar,
Your musings matutinal.
When in the drowsy afternoon
Your daughter sings a favourite tune
Of fantasy or frolic,
Alas, you suddenly are riled!
An organ-grinder drives you wild
With discords diabolic.
The licensed hawkers enter through
Your private gate, and swear at you
If barked at by your terrier :
And, as to prim Policeman X,
His stolid soul they never vex,
He thinks, the more the merrier.
You can't bave tennis on your lawn,
Or, 'neath a patulous oak withdrawn,
Play chess or talk of letters,
But in they troop, in search of pence,
And by sheer force of impudence
Assert themselves your betters.

buy him, and ride home.”
I hesitate. It's my first effort at horse-
dealing, and I did not expect this enor-
mous success. Oughtn't I to offer him on
trial ? Oughtn't I to say, “My dear fellow,
you'd better ride him to-day, and if he
suits, send me the money to-morrow" ?
No; why should I ?
Happy Thought.-JELFER 's old enough
to take care of himself.
“Or, I'll tell you what I'll do,” says
JELFER. “I'll give you half the money,
and swop my Grey with you-the one you
saw me on the other day. I don't want to
keep two, and I haven't got work enough
for the old Grey. You must have a horse,
and it would be a bargain for you.”
Now what does this mean? I know
JELFER's horse, and admire it. I have
often thought that JELFER'S Grey would
suit me. I shouldn't mind the exchange
with the money, only it is but fair that I
should ask the question:
“ The Grey 's not been down, has he ?".
“ Been down !” he exclaims. “You
couldn't throw him down if you tried.”
He is so hearty, that I am satisfied.
“You know him," he adds, carelessly,
"and there he is.”
As JELFER doesn't ask any further ques-
tions about mine, I won't ask any more
about his. I confess that I would rather
he did not make any more inquiries.
"Splendid goer, my old Grey," he says, as
he writes out the cheque. “He only wants
work, and you can give him that. There !”
The money has passed. Gazelle is no
longer my property. JELFER mounts him,
and promises to send his Grey this evening.
I have my misgivings. All that puzzles
me now, is, which has got the worst of it-
JELFER or myself ?
JELFER, I think, because I've got JEL-
FER's cheque. Certainly, it's only half the
money I asked, but the Grey is coming to-

When the Grey comes, I shall know.

Vouchsafed him easy days,
Bill-hook in hand would roam about
The oaken holts of Hayes,
Enforcing Nature's wise decrees,
Here lopping, felling there,
Where outworn boles from younger trees
Usurped the light and air.
What wonder if, with equal ease,
Brain and axe deal their blow,
If the same heat in felling trees
As fighting Bills he show ?
If of no task or toil afraid
That can tax strength and skill,
Upon Rome's oak he turn his blade,
And smite, come what come will!
So the famed Wizard of the North,
Where border skies shone clear,
Maida at heel, would hirple forth,
With staunch Tom PURDAY near,
To wander by Tweed's wimpling tide
His magic pen flung by,
And laid the minstrel's harp aside,
The Woodman's axe to ply.
ORTHODOXY AND FACT.
Of a truth, 0 Punch, our friend PAUL CULLEN and his Bishop
have made a needless admission in granting that a doctrine which
has passed for a dogma may turn out to be an opinion or a statement
which may have to be surrendered or modified because opposed to
science. Are any dogmas of mine opposed to one another? Who-
soever thinks so, without doubt he shall come to grief. That being
the case, it stands to reason that no conceivable theological dogma
can ever contradict, or be contradicted by any possible conclusion or
discovery of science whatever. As we are compelled by ecclesiastical
| authority to affirm that the sun moves round the earth, so we are
obliged by mathematical demonstration to confess that the earth
moves round the sun. And so forth. This is the truth of the whole
matter; which truth except everyone admit without hesitation, it
will be the worse for him."

MR. JUSTICE LUBH, the immediate release of the Claimant, and
the abolition of Gray's Inn."
There is reason to suppose that the petitions for the
above specified objects will have been signed by at least
half of the Peterborough electors. Ought Peterborough
to send two Members to Parliament when Colney Hatch
does not contribute one? The promoters of an idiotic
petition ought not all, perhaps, to be confounded with
those who sign it. Some of them might desire to get

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A NIGHT WITH LAWSON.
SIR WILFRID LAWSON is fast getting "developed ”
into the comic orator of the United Kingdom Alliance.
Addressing a meeting of the “Sheffield Auxiliary” of
that body the other night, he said that he was always
willing to address meetings in dark places, and Sheffield,
unfortunately, was not this year so light as it was last,
inasmuch as one Member for the town steadily voted
with the publicans, and the other with the public." If
one of the Members for Sheffield voted with the publicans,
and the other with the public, it would seem that between
them they voted altogether for the public-house. The
one who voted for the public may then have voted
against the clause in the Licensing Act which shuts the
public out of the restaurants on Sunday afternoon just
during the very hours when they want to dine, and does
not let them in until when, if they dine, they will be un-
able, with any comfort, to go to Church. If this is what
SIR WILFRID meant to say, it was certainly a funny
way of pleading the cause of the United Kingdom
Alliance.
Is SIR WILFRID LAWSON, indeed, always willing

· EXPIRING COPYRIGHTS.
" There was once a London publisher who was described as a vulture feed-
ing on expiring copyrights."--The MASTER OF THE ROLLB.
Such publishers Punch does not want to know,
But fain he would learn, from some lawyer clever,
. Why should the right in works of genius go,
While land and stocks and shares are owned for ever?
· Just a few years beyond an author's life
The work he does belongs to his relations :
"And then, the publishers, in venal strife,
: May sell for pence the heritage of nations.
Well for the people they should cheaply read
The great work of some intellectual giant,
Who laughs at every superstitious creed,
And is of every form of cant defiant.,
But, England, an ill use thou seem'st to foster
When of thy greatest men the seed thou starvest,
That dwellers in the Row of Paternoster
May from their writings reap an ample harvest.
Lords of wide manors, gained, perchance, by crime,
Leave to their children woods and fields and waters :
Why should not gold from golden song sublime
Subsistence be for poets' sons and daughters ?
· BIRDS IN THE HAND. - ?
As the popularity of battue shooting seems to be yearly on the
increase, a new "Game Protection Bill," may be shortly expected.
With a view to improving the position of the Birds (as it may be
anticipated to become twelve months hence), Mr. Punch would
propose that the following regulations should be enforced by the
much-needed measure to which he has just made allusion. ..
1. The Birds should be allowed to leave their cages before they
are made the marks of the Sportsmen.
2. No Sportsman should fire at a Bird with a gun having more
than four barrels, unless he gives it (the Bird) a clear start of three
yards.
3. Birds answering to pet names should be allowed to see the
guns of the Sportsmen before they are fired at.
4. A Bird settling on the shoulder of a Sportsman should not be
fired at until it (the Bird) rises to fly away.
_N.B.-This Regulation should always be enforced, as pot shots at
Birds in the above position often lead to accidents.
5. Birds should not be chained by their legs to the trees, unless
they (the Birds) are very wild, and show a decided disposition to
fly away..
6. Lastly, to distinguish battue from other shooting, those who
take part in it should be known in future as Poulterers instead of
Sportsmen.
The Kingdom of Beer.
Is it the fact that, as SIR WILFRID LAWSON says, “Beer is King
in England”? If that were true, His Majesty's subjects would be
as sober as they were meant to be made when shops were licensed
for beer alone to be “drunk on the premises.” Surely it is not
eer but Alcohol that reigns in Gin Palaces.
A Caution. .. ..
We are Giants at present, and quite big enough,
But take care how you stretch us—we ain't werry tough;
And stretching might p'raps bring to light some weak p’int in us,
Or, we both on us think, might p'raps lame every j'int in us.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE LAST OF SIR ROGER.
THERE comes a message from the sea
To tell how ROGER TICHBORNE-he
Who, by his waste of early years,
Taught perjurers' hopes to outweigh fears-
Far in the South Pacific died,
And sleeps the lonely wave beside.
It may be false, it may be true,
It carries but a doubtful hue;
But this is clear the artful dodger,
Whose vulgarisms were “just like ROGER,”
Had ne'er found knaves, or misled fools,
ONSLow and WHALLEY made his tools,
But for the fact that ROGER went
Away in moody discontent,
Broke ties of duty, hearth and home,
In wild, unsettled lands to roam,
Went, Heaven knows whither, Heaven knows why,
In some far wilderness to die.
This is the lesson of the case :
Young men of our strong English race,
Destined to hold ancestral land,
Rule yourselves if you'd learn command;
Rush not to savage rudeness, weary
Of polish by excess made dreary,
From too luxurious life's routine,
Seek Himalayan change of scene;
Turn from the traps of Hurlinghame
To veldt's or prairie's wilder game,
For dull battue and tedious drive
Seek lions to keep sport alive,
And try if bisons can restore
A warmth that foxes wake no more.
Nor if some high-heeled, chignoned girl,
Of Prince's paragon and pearl,
Snub you, or with cold shoulder freeze,
Seek squaw at the Antipodes.
Noblesse oblige : this lesson take,
Ye gilded youth, for England's sake:
All time ill-spent revenge will wreak;
In life's stern law, they pay that break;
In person oftenest you make payment,
Sometimes SIR ROGER breeds the Claimant.

For shame! Is our humanity a dream ?
No: put all crime on rose-water régime:
Treat those who brain their babes, their wives who smash,
With loving kindness, not with brutal lash;
Deal with your murderer as an erring child;
Advice, with beef and beer, makes most men mild.

ROUGH ROADS.
“ VERY CULPABLE HOMICIDE.- At the High Court of Justiciary, Edin-
burgh, on Monday, the LORD JUSTICE CLERK and LORD ARDMILLAN on the
bench, ANDREW WALLACE, a young man, a collier, was placed at the bar on
a charge of murder. The indictment set forth that on the 30th of August
last, in his house in Boyd Street, Kilmarnock, he lifted up his child, JESSIE
WALLACE, aged two years and seven months, and dashed her head against
some pieces of furniture, and also on the floor, in consequence of which the
child's skull was fractured, and she died shortly afterwards. The prisoner
tendered a plea of Guilty of culpable homicide. The SOLICITOR-GENERAL
said that, after considerable hesitation, he had come to the conclusion that
there were circumstances in the case which warranted him in accepting this
plea, whereupon the LORD JUSTICE CLERK passed a sentence of twenty years'
penal servitude.”
WHAT, penal servitude for twenty years !
(It moves the kind philanthropist to tears)
For merely dashing out his infant's brains
In a slight fit of passion ? Justice reigns,
No doubt, in sober Scotland, yet sometimes,
Surely, goes too far in avenging crimes !
Consider, ANDREW WALLACE, young and bright,
Offshoot, perhaps, of that famed WALLACE wight
Who chased from Falkirk's field the English foe,
Now very near six hundred years ago,
Torn from his drink, his friends, his home, his wife,
For twenty years must lead a prisoner's life,
From hard stone-quarrying in Portland Bay
Return, ere fifty, prematurely grey,
And all because, though usually mild,
He one day crushed the cranium of his child !
Do not our punishments grow too severe ?
Hear those harsh martinets, who hold it clear
The brute who his own innocent could brain,
While there's a gallows best deserves its pain.
What if both nostrums be too often vain ?
If the Rough's hide oft prove hard as his brain ?
While brutes are brutes, how should brute's doings cease,
In spite of schools, gaols, gallows, and police ?
Would we cut off the springs of brutal crime,
We must attack the brute-germ ere its prime:
Lift gutter children from their low estate,
Catch them, and school, and Christianise, and wait,
Content to "find our bread cast”-not away,
“ Upon the waters, after many a day!”
While our residuum, proletarian, spreads,
Untaught, untended, hands-not hearts or heads-
If they drink, beat, brain, murder, now and then,
'Tis brute toil, brute life, that make brutes of men.
If the great leaders of our party strife,
The classes blest in schooled and guarded life,
Can catch the rough-child ere rough-man he grow,
And tame, and train, and teach, good fruit will show.
Low living and high thinking may unite,
And hands with heads and hearts new union plight,
Till England purged of brutal shame shall stand,
And Roughs and rough crimes perish from the land.

of scenes, and omitting personages goes, will be ad-
mitted by all. But is he at liberty to alter the course of
an action, as by changing an unhappy to a happy ter-
mination-or to modify an author's intention, as by
changing the tone of a character by suppression of
dialogue, or palpably to disregard indications of inten-
tion conveyed in parts of the dialogue which he re-
tains ?
Both these latter liberties MR. IRVING, or MR. BATE-
MAN, has taken, and I should think the actor had more
to do with them than the manager.
I least liked, and least went along with MR. IRVING
in his dealings with the Ghost. It seemed to me that
he had not realised, as our American cousins would say,
the effect of the sight of a real ghost on such a man.
I do not see how this is to be done, unless he can
contrive to believe in the Ghost; and to do this, even
in imagination, except for a Spiritualist, must be difficult
in these days. As COLERIDGE used to say he had seen
too many ghosts to believe in them : so may we all say
in these times of spirit-hands, dark seances, the DAVEN-
PORT Brothers, and Mrs. GUPPY.
I say nothing of the utter sacrifice of the opening
scene of the play. That is inevitable so long as the
scene is played close on the foot-lights. In the Crystal
Palace representation the whole stage was opened for
it, at the cost of a brief closing of tableau-curtains,
before the Great Hall was discovered. Only in this way
can the effect be imparted to that wonderful opening
which it deserves and requires, to give it its due import-
ance in the action. But the scene being in the hands
of "utility” people, what manager is likely to put
himself out of the way for Francisco and Bernardo, and
Marcellus, or even Horatio ?
SHAKSPEARE's Hamlet, wonderful in so many ways, is in none more wonder-1. Passing by this blemish, as not immediately concern-

His Honour, the Judge, however, said
that such horseplay was detestable, and
how the Mayor of Maidenhead should tole-
rate such things he could not understand.
It was a disgrace to English gentlemen.
The judicial remark about horseplay will be
recognised by some readers, especially our
Scotch friends, as a good hit at the Mayor.
But a still better joke was that made at the
expense of the defendant by the Jury in re-
turning a verdict for the full amount
claimed of £10 and costs. The custom of
bumping at Maidenhead is one to which the
remark of Hamlet on that of drinking at
Elsinore might be properly applied. It need
not be quoted ; if you want to hear it, go

Tue Mayor and Council of Maidenhead
Went forth to beat the bounds;
A merry affair no doubt it was
As they gaily went their rounds.
Wherever they stopped the Mayor was

And the Town Clerk also :

They might please themselves, you know.

May delight such dignified gentlemen--
But they should not make mistakes.
Be bumped, Mr. Mayor, whene'er you will,
If you like such elegant sport,
But don't treat others in that same way,
For fear of the County Court.
But if bumping suits municipal folk,
Punch sees no reason why
Ratepayers should not bump their Mayors
Whenever the rates grow high.
Whenever the fever-spreading stench
Of drainage haunts the air,
Take a hint from the people of Maidenhead
And instantly bump the Mayor.
When the gas won't burn in the public
lamps,
When the police are rare,
When there's water neither to wash nor
drink,
Then bump his Worship the Mayor.
So here's a bumper to Maidenhead,
And a health to its sturdy Mayor,
Who seems to hold, in every way,
The seat of honour there!

Established Dissenters.
We are told that it is no longer the Dissenters of the
Liberation Society alone who compass and imagine the
Disestablishment of the National Õhurch. Many of the
Ritualist Clergy also are said to contemplate it, in case
the laws are enforced against their mimicries of Roman
Catholicism. Thus disestablishment is contemplated
not only by Dissenters without the Church, but also
by Dissenters within. In the meantime might not these
established Dissenters as well disestablish themselves ?

DEAR MR. DEAN,
5th December, 1874.
THE deep interest which every educated Eng-
lishman must feel in the fortunes of the noblest archi-
tectural work which the genius of a fellow-countryman
has invented, induces me to address to you, before it is
too late, some practical remarks upon the proposed
mutilation of your Cathedral.
I must protest against the really disgraceful inno-

vations that have been made during the present century
in the interior of St. Paul's. Why has the choir been
gilded P Why has stained glass been put up in some of
the windows? Why has a new organ been purchased ?
What did SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN know about any of
these things ? Did he order the gilding, the stained
glass, or the organ?
No, Mr. Dean, let the Cathedral return to its old
condition. Remove the fine new pulpit, and set up a deal

DEAR MR. DEAN,

It appears that St. Paul's depends entirely upon

destroy the finest gilding and the most gorgeous colours.
Now, Very Reverend Sir, my brother has discovered
a new sort of glass, that may be applied in a liquid state
without damage to the costliest decorations, and my
own invaluable adaptation of the lime-light to domestic
purposes is admirably suited to the illumination of large
public buildings, both by day and by night.

SALMO AND OSTREA.
An Eclogue in an Estuary.
A MIGHTY Salmon, on his upstream way,
Paused where in bed a pensive Oyster lay
Plump in her shell, and, ere he onward flew,
Said, "Bivalve Maiden, how I envy you!”
OSTREA.
Wherefore, O knightly wanderer of the Sea,
Lord of all rivers, should you envy me?
Here as I lie, each day I lonelier grow,
My sisters taken by the human foe,
And well I guess, their fate must soon be mine,
To whet the appetite of men who dine.
SALMO.
Even so our race have suffered : every river
Had dangers dire that made our boldest quiver.
To reach the stream, how cautious must we move
To 'scape the perils of stake-net, and cruive:
Once in the stream, there were fair rods to fear,
Besides the poacher's pocket-purse, and spear:
While, if the leister we escaped, we met,
A little farther on, the casting net.
Now we're preserved-a care we did not crave,
Since peril is a pleasure to the brave.
OSTREA.
Ah, yours I know to be a daring race:
I like my bed, a pleasant resting-place.
Things will be altered soon; the fiying mews
Drop, as they pass, some scraps of earthly news.
We shan't be underspatted, 'lis alleged,
And, even better, sha'n't be overdredged.
They'll try to give me, in this still retreat,
Two things I love, tranquillity and heat.
SALMO.
Man means you mischief, Lady of the Shell !
He would reduce the price at which you sell.
I am degraded—'tis a sad come down;
Sold at a shilling through the greedy town.
You and your sisters, cheap enough of old,
Will soon be worth almost your weight in gold.
Have you no proper pride, and are you willing
To be hawked about, two dozen for a shilling?
Perish the notion! In her happiest mood,
Nature made oysters for a regal food :
Sold for a halfpenny! If you feel with me,
You 'll say, “No; rather let us cease to be!"
Up through the bright stream silver Salmo sped,
While pensive Ostrea turned upon her bed,
Doubtful between two evils, which the worst,
To be dredged out, or by preserving curst.
“Self-preservation,” she at length began,
“Is the first law of oyster, as of man;
But what man calls preserving fish or game,
Is but destruction by another name.
He raves of the delight to us he owes,
As our soft sapor o'er his palate flows;
Thanks us, because, when other viands bore,
We whet the edge of appetite once more;
In short, declares, of all months in the year,
We make the months with R.'s in them most dear.
Then, un-preserved, their beds let natives keep-
If we're so dear-why would man have us cheap ?"

THE TRANSIT OF VENUS.
THE Transit of Venus is over :
A spot on the Sun for four hours,
The radiant aërial-rover
Now sparkles the chief of star-flowers.
Home troop the astronomers various,
And bring their celestial log,
Some rendered by sunshine hilarious,
Some damped by inopportune fog.
They went forth in peaceful battalions,
The secrets of Science to clutch,
Americans, Germans, Italians,
With Frenchmen and English and Dutch:
Where the hardness of ice defies granite's,
Where lizards the noon-day warmth shun,
They watched the most brilliant of planets
Turn sable in crossing the Sun.
“Alma Venus," exclaimeth LUCRETIUS ;
Fair Goddess, the player of many tricks,
Of doings fantastic, facetious,
The quite inexhaustible genetrix !
Now binding all nations together
In a scheme tele-plus-spectroscopic,
Star-goddess, you bring us fair weather,
And we hail you as most philanthropic.
When, braving sub-tropic malaria,
And noses and fingers that freeze,
From Kerguelen to dismal Siberia
Astronomers sail o'er the seas,
Fair Venus, our beautiful neighbour,
Throws down her distinguishing light,
'Twixt the armies for Science who labour,
And the armies for conquest who fight.
Punch with patience waits tidings of Science,
But waits, with a thirsty impatience,
For the time when all warlike defiance
Will cease among civilised nations.
From quarrelling canst thou not screen us,
O brightest and clearest of stars,
And let the last Transit of Venus
Be crowned by the Exit of Mars ?

THE Times' Paris Correspondent states in a telegram
respecting the Ultramontane representative whom Bis-

"PRINCE BISMARCK's recommendation to him to use plenty
of water has created much amusement, HERR GEORG being
rather negligent as to his personal appearance.”
This HERR GEORG, or JOERG, or JÖRG, whichever
his name is, perhaps combines new-fangled Ultramon-
tanism with antique sanctity, of which he may be
imagined to live, intending to die, in the odour. The
typical ascetic saint appears to have entertained a
peculiar objection to water. With the exception of holy
water, he seems to have been accustomed hardly ever
to make use of water, except for drinking purposes, and
to have made a point of specially eschewing water in
connection with soap. But though the above-named

SMELFUNGUS ON SKATES.
Of all things, what Papa most hates
To buy his boys, must, sure, be skates.
The price of boots and shoes he pays
For trappings used perhaps three days.
A youth's foot grows; and that foot-gear
Will be too short for him next year,
Though it might be his junior's wear;
Then, like as not, the ice won't bear;
and thus, on small amount of play,
A sum of money's thrown away!
'Tis true that, should the ice be thin,
Your little boy may tumble in ;
And, if perchance he should be drowned,
Skates will have saved you many a pound.
Still, that reflection will impart,
Perhaps, to the paternal heart,
Not all the solace which it might,
Viewed in a philosophic light.

defendant, "SIR R. PHILLIMORE ruled that
the charge of undue elevation was not

acquitted of misconduct so very scandalous
as that of undue elevation. At the same
time, it is not saying too much to recom-
mend all reverend gentlemen who persist
in setting their Bishops at defiance and
breaking the law, to keep themselves within
the bounds of sobriety. This they will do
if they will carefully confine their practice
of elevation to endeavouring to elevate their
hearers.

STEAKS IN TOWN.
"A receipt, dated 1776, was produced for a payment of two shillings for
eight pounds of steak.”—Times' Law Report.
O PROGRESS is a noble thought,
Our glowing hopes to kindle !
With rifled guns our wars we've fought,
We've heard the words of TYNDALL.
We've seen the Church go merrily round
Through High, and Broad, and Low:
But we sigh for the steak at threepence a pound
Of a hundred years ago.
We ride by steam at a penny a mile,
And talk to our friends by lightning ;
We skate without ice in splendid style,
So a cold bath is not frightening ;
And as there isn't a cook to be found,
For they all to College go,
We long for the steak at sixpence a pound
Of fifty years ago.
Why 'tisn't as many years ago
We dwelt in Temple Cloisters,
And used to the cosy “Cock” to go
For steak and sauce of oysters :
But such juicy cuts at a modest price
No more the Cock can show:
And gone is the steak at eight pence a pound
Of twenty years ago.
With lots of science, not much use,
Our luckless brains we pester :
But none of our “ologies" help to produce
Two oysters for less than a tester.
And this Yule-tide, if you wander round
To the butchers' shops, I know
You 'll scarce find the steak at a shilling a pound
Of but five years ago.
CHRISTMAS “CRACKERS.”
The whole of the Monument will be illuminated with coloured
lamps and Chinese lanterns, between the hours of eight and twelve
on Christmas Eve.
The principal dish on the Pope's table, on Christmas day, will
consist of a noble baron of beef, supplied by a beast born and bred
on LORD ACTON's Shropshire estate.
All the Bishops will assemble to see DR. COLENSO off.
In the Christmas Pantomimes and Burlesques, the young persons
who take part in the dances will wear thick dresses coming down to
their ancles.
Her Royal Highness the DUCHESS OF EDINBURGH will be serenaded
by the Waits.
MR. GLADSTONE and ARCHBISHOP MANNING will exchange Christ-
mas Cards.
The LORD MAYOR, the Sheriffs, the Recorder, the Mace-bearer and
Sword-bearer, Gog and Magog, and the rest of the Civic Dignitaries,
all in their state robes, will play publicly at Snap-Dragon in the
Guildhall, as usual at this festive season.
It is calculated that the strings of sausages, sold in the London
Market alone, during Christmas week, reached to upwards of sixty-
four miles.
The Directors of the Bank of England will present a new half-
crown to every applicant wearing a respirator, and carrying a flag
embroidered with the City Arms, who can give satisfactory proof
to their Solicitors that he is of kin to the Founder. The loving cup
will be passed round in the Bank Parlour on this interesting occa-
sion, and a display of fireworks will take place in the evening,
weather and the state of the funds permitting.
With reference to the proposed Arctic Expedition, we are
authorised to announce that the most complete arrangements
have been made to photograph the North pole on a scale hitherto
unattempted.
“CHRISTMAS NUMBERS.”—The people who look forward every
Christmas to the annual delight of seeing Punch's Almanack.
