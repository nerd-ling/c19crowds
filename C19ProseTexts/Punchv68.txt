M he Longest Day was creeping slowly to its close. It was hot, very hot. Cool garments and cooling drinks were impera-
1 tively the order of the time. Motion was out of the question. Perspiration and meditation reigned supreme.
Under the shade of his own vine and fig-tree, over the coolest of cups, in the airiest of zephyrs, sat MR. Punch, with
his feet on the refrigerator from wbich he had been extracting the crystalline lumps which bobbed refreshingly, amidst the
green leaves and blue blossums of the fragrant borage, on the waves of the cool Moselle. There he reclined, in the summer
stillness, thinking, for more coolness, of the Pole and our gallant Explorers, who, by this time, must have taken a long
leave of Cape Farewell.
Already they must be within the Arctic Circle. Before this, probably, they have replenished their bunkers, and shipped
their dogs, at Disco. Dogs !-who knows? Ere now, perhaps, they may be beset by the formidable “pack” en masse,
gathering and growling and showing sharp, jagged teeth under the stems of the daring Islanders who have dared to invade
that solitary realm. Even now they may be sighting the “ Devil's Thumb,” protruded ominously to warn all comers off his
ice-preserves in Melville Bay.
Punch quaffed his cup to their success, and wished himself, for the moment, in their cooler quarters.
“Yes," he murmured, “it is a noble achievement to break into that charmed circle where sits enthroned—for the
winning of some Thomas CARLYLE of the Future—his oft-invoked favourite, The Everlasting Silence.
"The Everlasting Silence'! Can she be a Woman, by the way, as I have limned her? And if she is, how tired she
must be of herself! How fain, methinks, to fling herself into the arms of the gallant mariners who come to break her-and
substitute the silvern speech for her pale and frosted gold !
“But what a realm is hers—with what mysteries she has been entrusted, no doubt, as a reward for holding her tongue !
“There, at her frost-fettered feet,” Punch said, as Maury said before him, “icebergs are framed and glaciers launched ;
there the tides have their cradle and their grave, the whales their nursery; there the winds complete their circuits, and the
currents of the sea their round in the wonderful system of oceanic circulation ; there the Aurora is lighted up, and the
trembling needle brought to rest. There are the Pole of the Winds, and the Poles of Cold; the Pole of the Earth and the
Magnet. It is a great treasure-house of mysteries, and the desire to explore its secret chambers has grown into a longing.
It is no feverish excitement, no vain ambition, that leads men there. It is a higher feeling, a holier motive,-a desire to look
into the works of Creation, to comprehend the economy of our planet, and to grow wiser and better by the knowledge !”.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 3, 1875.
Before PUNCH got to this point he had passed from the realms of speech into the kingdom which King Somnus and
Queen Silence share between them--and lo! he was alone-alone-
" The first
That ever burst
Into that silent sea !”
It was a case of ice, as LORD DUFFERIN's Valet observed to his Lordship aboard his yacht off Jan Mayen,—" ice all
around.”
Punca had outstripped the Alert and the Discovery. Hugging his new Volume to his breast, as the best of all life-
preservers, a source of perennial light and heat, more sustaining than pemmican, more defiant of chill than three-piled duffle,
he had urged his way, gallantly, across pack and hummock, over berg and floe. And now he was TAERE. But WHERE ?
Latitude and Longitude had ceased to be. If Time and Space were at all, it was as much as they were.
The Midnight Sun burned red on the horizon ; the distant howl of the Great Bear, which had long been distinctly
audible, was now deafening.
Punch stood, at last, where never living man had stood before- FACE TO FACE WITH THE POLE !
He did not feel giddy, not even dizzy—only calm. He was not cold-only cool. The fact is, he was at home in that
proud position, on the apex of the round World (if anything so nearly round can be said to have an apex)—with the Globe at
his feet !
He looked superbly around !
What is that white mass gathered at the base of the spindle on which our Earth revolves ? An iceberg ? No,—a
sweet though snow-clad, and, presumably, snow-cold creature, gracefully enwrapped in a mantle of frozen drift, under a veil
fringed with crystalline icicles, half hiding, half revealing her coy loveliness!
Yes! it is the Polar Queen—the Lady of the Everlasting Silence—the Ice Maiden that hath waited to be won from
creation till now.
Gracefully advancing, Punch kneeled before her. There came a voice from behind the veil —
“ My Deliverer! At last! O how have I waited and longed for thee! But, first, thy credentials.”
Punch laid at her feet
VOLUME SIXTY-EIGHT.
She seized it eagerly—tore open its pages—and a roar as of many pent-up water-floods let loose of a sudden shook
the Seven Stars, and made the beams of her Auroral Crown shoot wildly to the zenith. It was the breaking up, and down, of
The Everlasting Silence, under the laughter-compelling spell of Punch!
“Come to my heart !" she murmured-and suddenly Punch felt a rushing chill as of an avalanche, yet pervaded by a
delicious perfume, oversweep his frame-
He had knocked over his tankard, and was wet through with the Moselle-Cup.
But he knew that his Volume was in the hands of Her Polar Majesty, and was happy!

CLAIRVOYANT CHRONOLOGY.

brutes who beat their Wives.
1876. A marked decrease is noted in
the noble sport of Wife beating, owing to
the civilising influence of the Cat.
1880. Startling discovery of a foot-
warmer, furnished gratis by the Com-
pany, in an English Third-class Carriage.

TENDERNESS FOR THE BRUTE CREATION.
-A good old English squire and M.F.H.,
having happened to read COLERIDGE'S
Ancient Mariner, said if anyone got bur-
dened with a guilty conscience by only
shooting an Albatross, wbat remorse
must perpetually prey upon the man who
has shot a Fox!
ABERRATION OF INTELLECT.-A Member
of the Anti-Tobacco Association, who is
also a Good Templar, making a speech,
said, in an exacerbation of insanity, that
Tobacco might begin with T, but was it
not, in almost all cases, accompanied
with intoxicating liquor?
RIDDLE FOR THE SICK-Room.- When is

So nursed in Pantomimes poor babes are seen
By reckless Clown and ancient Pantaloon-
Crammed with strange pap, with blacking-brush scrubbed

Chucked to and fro, their nurses' hands between,
And sat upon, if restless they have been
Under hot poker, sorubbing-brush, or spoon.

Or just conceive the Queen of Loves and Pleasures
Made use of to correct men's weights and measures !

She's sweet on savants, and her chief reliance is
On those ridiculous things they call their Sciences.

These prying fools-0 dismal degradation !-
Care less for Phæbus than his habitation.
Not unto such shall veilless Venus rise,
Love on her lips and laughter in her eyes ;
No, let them turn their trumpery tubes afar
To watch the twinklings of some tenth-rate star.
By Paphos, passion's roses fire my cheeks!
A fig for "progress,”-give me back my Greeks !
Have these blunt-witted Britons an idea
That Science suits the shrine of Cytherea ?
Is it for this their daughters I have dowered
With all the charms which 'neath my cestus flowered,
When I was Queen of every heart in Hellas ?-
Charms that might make my darling Helen jealous.
'Twould serve them right to turn each maiden's nose
As blue (poor darlings !) as Minerva's hose.
Men mouth our names, ye gods, but to insult us,
And mock us with mere mathematic cultus.
But Science has no camera that focusses
Her whose white feet amidst the golden crocusses

Would quite eclipse the thing they call her Transit.

She reckons certainly without her Cupid.
Pallas may prate, but I'll find means to check her-
She's only the Olympian LYDIA BECKER.

The Queen of Hearts is match for all the Sciences :
Nor shall they snatch a spell from all the stars,
To break the rule of her who vanquished Mars.
We'll lord it, She and I, while worlds revolve,
And Venus Victrix never need resolve
To shut up Paphos, or unyoke her sparrows,
While men have hearts, girls eyes, and Cupid arrows.
Postscript by Mr. Punch.
Punch, the sworn champion of British Beauty
Finds loyalty to Love his pleasing duty;
His Office, 85, Fleet Street, (between us) is
A very favourite shrine indeed of Venus's.
So he must print her plaint, yet thinks it groundless,
Deeming her empire, now as ever, boundless.

NEW-FASHIONED GHOSTS.
COME, Superstition, wondrous Maid,
No more in mouldy shroud arrayed,
But; clad in drawing-room attire,
Witch us without thine old blue tire.
Bid spirit-lights, instead, to dance
Before us at a dark séance;
For smell of sulphur, through our rooms
Diffuse the choicest of perfumes,
As Kiss-me-quick, and scents like those,
That lead us sweetly by the nose.
Instead of drawing round the grate
Ghost-stories merely to relate,
Around the board we'll form a ring,
And ghosts themselves about us bring
Their presence to announce by taps,
And spell us out their names with raps ;
Nay, talk, beneath the ribs of Death,
As though with voice of living breath,
No longer heaving hollow groans,
But chatting in familiar tones :
For the weird wail of other days,
Tipping us slang and current phrase;
Sometimes they will ", materialise"
Themselves to our admiring eyes,
Shake hands, and e'en, by such as list,
If ladies, let their lips be kissed,
Have locks cut from their spirit-hair,
And shreds from off the robes they wear.
What though through midnight air,
astride
Witches no longer broomsticks ride,
Yet “mediums still to ceilings rise ;
Still gas, turned down, to inward eyes
Reveals their airy "levitation,"
Wrought by no other incantation,
Than that of the accordion's strains,
Played out of tune, by spirit pains,
And such mysterious psalmoding,
As niggers at revivals sing.
This, Superstition, is to what
Thine ancient legends now have got,
Less thrilling interest they inspire
Than those once told round Christmas fire,
But send no children to their beds,

Thou terrifiest babes no more.

SUMMER AND WINTER.
How curiously our fancies vary
Betwixt July and January !
In Summer, little lady mine,
I twined your hair with eglantine,
In Winter, as, of course, you know,
Nought so becomes as mistletoe.
In Winter Cupid's favourite shop is
The drawing-room, and not the coppice:
Your slippered foot adorns the carpet,
Each eye is like an azure star, pet,
And the white hand that pours the Hyson,
By Aphrodite ! 'tis a nice'un.
Forgetting Summer's golden splendour,
Let's sit with feet upon the fender:
Let's put the skylark on his mettle,
With singing of our silver kettle,
Laugh at the follies of this clever age,
And brew our Punch-all-year-round beverage!

a deserter or bad character. Under the old rules-according to a
corporal, witness to a charge in a police-court of obtaining enlist-
ment by a false declaration-there was no difficulty in the matter:-
“ The man, on being discharged, would have been branded with the letters
'B. C.'—bad character-and this would have prevented his being enlisted
again.”.
Branding means nothing worse than tattooing on the inside of the
arm with needles and gunpowder, as ROGER TICHBORNE was tattooed
by LORD BELLEW for fun. It is therefore not painful, and it need
not be degrading. If the initials “B. C.” are open to that objection,
reverse them. What blackguard could feel himself otherwise than
dignified instead of degraded by the stamp of C.B., which would
only need to be read backwards to denote the blackguard instead of
the gentleman ? The Rogue's Tattoo would be a meet accompani-
ment to the Rogue's March.

When a third party stepped on the scene.

ANATHEMA ESTO!
A CIRCULAR letter with reference to the opinions on the con-
troversy touching the Vatican Degrees expressed by MR. HENRY
PETRE, of Dunkenhalgh, has been addressed by DR. VAUGHAN,
titular Bishop of Salford, to the Roman Catholic clergy of that
Papal diocese, commanding them to refuse the sacraments to MR.
PETRE unless he admits “the power of the Church to make defini-
tions of faith, and accepts in like manner the definitions actually
made and promulgated in 1854 and 1870." Will MR. PETRE give
in ? Not, perhaps, until excommunication shall have had the like
effects on him to those it produced on the Jackdaw of Rheims. To
the foregoing injunction is added the following menace :-
“Should any priest act in contravention of this command, he will be ipso
facto suspended from the use of his faculties."
What a fool, then, some people may say, the priest will have
made of himself! Not such a fool, perhaps, as those who believe
all that MR. PETRE questions. Is it not rather they who, by pros-
tration of their intellect, have suspended themselves from the use
of their faculties ?
Welcome Announcement.
PERHAPS the most pleasant item of the last week's news is the
announcement that
“There was a full supply of house coals at the coal market yesterday.
Business was exceedingly dúll, the tendency of the prices at the close of the
market being decidedly downward."
The dulness of business can only have been equalled by the
liveliness of Paterfamilias at such good news.
FOLLOWING THEIR NOSES.
We read a report of whales running ashore on the Orkney Coast
last week. They were of the bottle-nose kind, and probably followed
their noses, tempted by the free flow of “het-pint," a very tempting
new year's tipple, largely indulged in north of the Tweed.

Can such a transmigration indeed be true-from the battle of the Benches to
the battle of the Books, from Politics to Polemics, from HANSARD to HOMER?
Yes! He has chosen—and set us all asking, as CICERO asked POMPEY, but without his irony, “Tam bonus gladiator rudem
tam citò accepisti?”-Can such a fighter take his discharge so soon! With RUSSELL still politically combative and controversial, still
sensitive to a party raw, still hot over the memory of a party defeat and proud in the recall of a party triumph, at eighty-three! With
DISRAELI, only ten years younger, still in the Head-Master's Chair, still wielding the Head-Master's birchen sceptre over his Tory pupils
and subjects-GLADSTONE throws up the leadership of the Liberals at five years over the three score !
It cannot be true that time has done this, nor can we see in it the force of that destructive “tide in the affairs of men," which has
swept away so much good work-washed out all traces of so much gratitude.
Can it be that W. E. G. has found Pen a pleasanter or more potent weapon than Tongue-capable of being used with more
leisureliness in its aim, more precision in its stroke, more profit in the triumphs it secures ? But there are so many possible contri-
butors to the Contemporary of translations from Homer, even of translations as bad as W. E. G.'s of the speech of Achilles last year; so
many who could have set the Churches by the ears on the Vatican Decrees, and so few who can

call themselves “Liberal” can be content to serve and sink their differences; so few we can all be proud of; so few at whose feet
defeated enemies can lay their colours without shame!
But if the retrospect saddens, what is Punch to say of the prospect ? “Follow my Leader” was a game hard enough for some of the live-
lier Liberals to keep the rules of. But“ Choose my Leader” ..! What are those skittish and skipping spirits likely to make of that game ?
And when our ALEXANDER-even if he have passed his ring to GRANVILLE-has made no sign to guide the choice of his successor!
But that successor must be found. “Le Roi est mort!” Whose name is Punch to couple with his " Vive le Roi !"

THE LAST SONG OF A SAVAGE.
'Tis all for a misfortun? I'm condemned for to be 'ung,
As a warnin' and example to all Roughs both old and young.
'Twas brought in wilful murder because my wife did die
Just through my havin' kicked her-that's the honly reason wy.
I kicked her like I'd kicked her full many a time afore ;
I kicked her just as usual, I thought, no less nor more,
And only two days runnin'; but my ill-luck was such
One kick at last I give her as turned out a kick too much.
I do declare I never did intend to take her life,
But safe within an inch of it purposed to kick my wife,
Atakin' good care always short of murder for to steer,
And 'opin' hof the gallus by that means I should keep clear.
In pint of law I thought the crime of murder was intent.
Exactly not for to commit that much was what I meant;
So, therefore, when another's life it was my haim to spare,
To make me forfeit pay my own is wot I calls unfair.
I truly do repent the hextry kick I did bestow,
Or too much wigger unawares wot I flung into my toe.
Had I but know'd, I'd ne'er ha' kicked my wife completely dead,
To let myself in for the doom wot has 'lighted on my 'ed.
'Twas constant drink as brought me to the customary state
Wot caused the fatal haccident it grieve me to relate.
I was drunk the day I kicked her; I was also drunk the night.
When I kicked her the next mornin' I'd not yet got sober quite.
Liddon's Mycology.
CANON LIDDON has been driven by MONSIGNORE CAPEL to disclaim
certain doctrinal statements occurring in Ritualistic books of devo-
tion as "fungi.” A mycologist would perhaps like to know what
particular fungi the Canon means. As the statements in question
are rank Popery, it may be suggested that they are all so many
varieties of the Boletus Romanus. Of course CANON LIDDON cannot
regard them as common mushrooms, or any other sort of esculent
fungi, and, if he were a stanch Protestant, would class them with
the Russula emetica, the Amanita verna, the Lactarius torminosus,
and the other poisonous toadstools.

If ever you marry,
Be sure you don't marry a fool
Who's cram-full of learning,
And constantly burning

And psychio emotions

Remember Minerva

Seeking for reasons why
The circle and square
Are just what they are,
And can't be aught else if they try.
When, after thinking

He had not found the reasons why,
From his seat he arose
And cooked up his nose,
And said, “What a wise boy am I!”

He is full of how he treats himself when he is taken just in the

Why, I have a cough for more than half the year, twice as bad as

intervals. He won't believe it, because he doesn't see me pale,
emaciated, and writhing on a bed of sickness.

A NEW NATIONAL SONG.

O THE proud British pame 'tis a glory to bear,
So suggestive of all that is manly and fair!
The brave British Flag we have flaunted unfurled,
Till that bright bit of bunting's the “bore” of the world !
And who has been ever yet found to resist
That modern Thor's hammer, the true British fist ?
But now we must sing
Quite a different thing.
Long the lord of the seas and the pride of the Ring,
Let Joun BULL, with the world and his wife at his foot,
Lift a pæan in praise of the stout British Boot!
“There's nothing like leather!” We used to proclaim
That the knife was a sin, the sarate was a shame.
Our foes to chastise, or to chasten our wives,
What so manly and frank as a right “bunch of fives,"
Shot straight from the shoulder ? We've altered all that,
We stick, and we kick-in despite of the Cat !
No horn'd epidermis
So hard and so firm is,
For “nobbling" our wives, such the delicate term is,
As the thick leather sole, with stiff “uppers" to suit,
Of that sweetest of weapons, the stout British Boot!
Are our spouses remiss ? We'll their memory jog
With a brisk application of Lancashire clog;
That is better than manual punches or “ fibs"
To smash in and settle importunate “ribs”!
Effective enforcer of marital rights,
Companion and backer in “five to one" fights I
Our old British pluck
Has decidedly struck,
In enlisting your service, a new vein of luck,
Pint-pot, knuckle-duster, and Pat's oaken "shoot,"
All pale in thy glory, thou stout British Boot!
British pluck! Why, of course we're the bravest of men,
We bulldoggy Britons! With tongue and with pen
We've been telling the universe that, for so long!
In each patriot speech, and each national song,
What a theme it has been for self-soaping and bounce!
Yes, we know our unique tighting-weight to an ounce!
'Tis a militant land,
And we keep in our hand
By thumping our women and weaklings. That's grand.
And not only our hand we'll keep in, but our foot,
By a liberal use of the stout British Boot!
Upmanly ? Pah! Out on such sugary stuff!
JOIN BULL is no “molly”; he's best in the rough.
Your “chivalry” means, as a matter of course,
Just depriving a chap of the use of his force.
Nature favours a fellow with vigorous muscles,
To give him the pull of the women in tussles.
Legs sturdy and thick
Were intended to kick,
(We are learning that lesson in time double quick,)
And, as toes may be tender, we'll furnish each foot
With the rough's vade mecum, the stout British Boot!
There are fools who aver that the chap is a cur
Who'd admonish his wife with a kick or a purr”;
That the Cat is a creature too good for the dog
Who would smash his wife's ribs in with brazen-bound clog.
Most absurd, for all Britons are brave, and the kick
Is becoming their favourite militant trick.
We must alter our song,
“Hearts of Oak,” true as strong,
Have monopolised chorus and cheer far too long.
Let us sing, let us shout for the leather-shod foot,
And inscribe on our Banners “The Stout British Boot!"

Some to the blue are wed,

Where shot and shell the deadliest fell,

None dare look down on me!
And I feel, with the red coat on my back,
And the glorious flag I bear,
That while the two to each other are true,
They both can go anywhere.
But I have lived to find I'm wrong:
There's one place they can't go-
That's to West End stalls, and music-halls,
In the five and three shilling row.
And London's Managers can boast
What no foe has done to do-
Keep out Old England's Rank and File,
And her “Non-Commissioned ” too!
Now, there's red Guards and blue, and black-guards

But I hold it for a shame,
Red blue and black to clap all on a back,
And call 'em all the same.

Charles Kingsley.
BORN AT HOLNE, DEVON, JUNE 21, 1819; DIED AT EVERSLEY,
HANTS, JANUARY 23, 1875.
BORN in green Devon, nursed by her blue sea,
His heart, fed on her fairness and her fame,
Beat true to out-door life and nature free,
And thrilled to great deeds of our English name.
If Saxon e'er was Saxon to the core-
In hate of wrong, in trustfulness of right,
In strong man's sympathy with strength, nor more
In good man's love for good, as in God's sight-
This man was Saxon; Saxon too his love
Of wild things and wild sports by wood and wold:
To ride, shoot, speak the truth, he ranked above
Most arts, as did the Persian chiefs of old.
Out of a youth unfettered, frank, and free,
Came swift strong manhood, not without the storms
That clear the sky, if they stir up the sea
To level barriers and give shores new forms.
His faith in good, his trust in God's great ends,
Or so he deemed them,-urged him fearless on,
Through tracts of strange thought and new toil, while
friends
Frowned on the rashness that so wild had gone.
Not knowing what true needle, lead-line, chart,
Guided him, sounding on his trackless way,
Till in their fealty to that manly heart
Destroyers learnt to build, scoffers to pray.
He felt, and told, the ferment of our life;
Showed the same leaven swelling, fast and far,
In later Egypt's Alexandrine strife,
New faiths with old creeds then, as now, at war.
He raised strong Saxon HEREWARD from death,
In his grey shroud of mist from mere and fen;
Called up the England of ELIZABETH,
With DRAKE and RALEIGH, chiefs of Devon men.
Led us from Western combes to tropic isles,
Where giant cosmic forces have dwarfed man;
Taught us to trace, in Nature's frowns or smiles,
At home, abroad, signs of an all-wise plan.
Life, teaching, preaching, all tuned to one key,
of cheerful trust in God and hope for men;
Of faith that Earth more near to Heaven would be,
If from no height gained we fall back again.
A Churohman stanch, yet whose church-door stood wide
For Christians of all creeds to enter in.
A village Pastor, though on every side
His flock ranged far as voice or pen could win.
Lightly let who will rate a life so sped,
Of sympathies so sweeping, faith so wide,
England has juster measure for the dead
As she stands mourning at his coffin's side,
And notes how short the life so well employed,
Its thread cut mid-way fifty and three score,
And counting all he felt, toiled, loved, enjoyed,
Scarce grieves to think his cup can hold no more.

does interest me so much! I mean, I am eager to hear more."
"Good," he returned. “You shall. But, at present, No Name."
“I have read it.”
“Of course you have. Everybody has. See!”
He started off as he spoke, and was working the wheels of his
chair, flying like a whirlwind (on wheels, of course) round and
round the room. Then he paused for breath.
“There!” he exclaimed; "that's how I blow off some of the

Before I could stop him he had thrown himself out of his chair
head-foremost, and was now walking upside-down on the floor.
“I can do this on my head,” he cried, exultingly.
In another minute he was back again in his chair, a hand on each
wheel.
“Do you know what these are called ?” he asked.
I suggested timidly that, for my part, and for want of any better
information on the subject, I should have called them “wheels."

BULL
THE LIBERAL LEADERSHIP.
N the little-known
subject of the
responsible post
of Leader of the
Opposition in the
House of Com-
mons, we have
thought it our
duty — uninflu-
enced by party
bias, and un-
moved by politi-
cal prejudice—to
collect all the
available infor-
mation from the
most unimpeach-
able traditionary
sources, the best and most handsomely bound standard authors,
the rolls and journals of Parliament, family archives of priceless
rarity, and private documents not generally accessible to the public
eye.
The office is of considerable antiquity, probably as old as the
Chiltern Hundreds ; but it is sufficient for our present purpose to
note that for several days in the reign of one of our later EDWARDS
there was the same uncertainty at the Clubs, about the next occupant
of the post, as we have just experienced. (Sée HOLINSHED, MATTHEW
PARIS, FROISSART, HANSARD, &c.)
The post is not hereditary, and a younger son may aspire to it,
if he can lay claim to the genius of CHARLES JAMES Fox, the
eloquence of EDMUND BURKE, and the wit of RICHARD BRINSLEY
SHERIDAN, or any one of them.
There is no salary, or uniform attached to the office, and no
allowance for coals, candles, or gas. Its perquisites and privileges
are enveloped in a cloud of precedents; but it is understood that
the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition can claim large paper copies
of all Blue Books and parliamentary papers, and is entitled, if not
by statute, certainly by immemorial usage, to the undisturbed
occupation of the first seat on the front bench on the left hand of
the SPEAKER. He may also look forward, with as much cheerfulness
as he can assume, to seeing his Portrait Model, advertised and
placarded as among the most recent additions to MADAME TUSSAUD's
Exhibition.
Full evening dress is de rigueur, except at morning sittings, or
when the House is in Committee; but white kid gloves need not
be worn, unless the Mace is on the table.
The post is one which demands many and varied qualifications in
the occupant-eloquence, tact, temper, business hàbits, wakeful-
ness, patience, courtesy, a good cook, a sound digestion, and a fund
of quotations from the poets of antiquity (Homer, Horace, Virgil,
Quintus Smyrnæus, &c.), Pope, Goldsmith, the Rejected Addresses,
and the l'oetry of the Anti-Jacobin. There is no limit as to age,
but candidates must be over twenty-one, and under the grand cli-
macteric. A married man is usually preferred cæteris paribus.
When once the Leader has been selected, he may retain the post
as long as he pleases; but on the receipt of a round-robin signed by
a quorum, expressing dissatisfaction with his policy, or his meta-
phors, or his cook, he is bound to resign or provide a substitute.
Every Wednesday during the Session, the Leader of the Opposi-
tion is expected to give a dinner to twenty of his party, attired in
full Court dress. To prevent any suspicion of partiality or undue
favour, Members are invited in exact alphabetical order. The Whips
are present alternately. If the Leader is married, his wife throws
open her salons later in the evening, without opposition.
Resignation of his post is followed by a seat in the House of
Lords, if the Leader has been created a Peer; if not, by retirement into
private life and quiet enjoyment of the country, surrounded by his
books and his bees.
Must be foolish indeed, and as fidgety, quite,
As yon crass hippopotamus venting his spite
On the innocent reeds. Ah! that plump little Nigger
Was toothsome. It's true that he might have been bigger
But so choice a bonne-bouche does not always turn up,
When a Cayman's sharp set, and desirous to sup,-
There's a great deal of waste in Creation !
That's a thought that has often come into my head,
A text on which truly a deal might be said :
There is much in this world that requires explanation !
'Tis certainly odd,
That the Crocodile God,
Who doubtless created our kind by his nod,
From a Protoplasm-pea,
Did not also decree
That so very superior an order as we
Should be worshipped and fed by inferior creatures,
Like monkeys and men, whose ridiculous features,
So destitute wholly of Saurian beauty,
Shows submission to us is a matter of duty.
No doubt it was so in the days long ago;
But the world's out of order, and e'en Alligators,
Like princes and priests, stand in terror of traitors.
If Providence truly meant us to be dominant,
It is clear that these Men are becoming too prominent;
They grow altogether too proud and ambitious,
Whereas, as mere matters of food, they 're delicious;
And surely one glance at our teeth and our jaws is
To any believer in ultimate causes
A positive proof
That in Cosmos's woof
Men must have been shaped for our special behoof.
Our teeth were made sharp just to crunch them, and they
Were made bony, yet toothsome, to give teeth full play-
A sample, I'm sure, of correlative fitness,
To which 'MR. DARWIN would gladly bear witness.
And then, look again, in the matter of waste !
What a-- Well, let us say what a singular taste
Must that ruler have had, who could be so absurd
As to call into being a flower or a bird !
Though-ahem !--stop a bit,-
From this general "non fit”
I must really except that convenient tit,
Who serves as a Volunteer tooth-pick to me.
But flowers ! by old Nilus, I never could see
The use of a lotus ; it's not good to eat,
And its smell, I am sure, is disgustingly sweet.
It is quite out of place, this ridiculous bud,
In the Crocodile's heaven of sunshine and mud.
Beauty ?-nonsense and stuff—'tis a fetish barbarian. ;
All Saurian Science is Utilitarian.
Though critics disdainfully level that term at us,
'Tis the genuine" note" of the breed pachydermatous.
Ah, me! for that dear dead diluvial time,
The right golden age of our Cayman chronology,
When the whole of Creation was water and slime,
And Saurian ethics required no apology!
Talk of Progress, indeed! That's all fiddle-de-dee
'Tis becoming unpleasantly certain to me
That the jolly old days are as good as departed.
However, no need to be dull or down-hearted,
The status quo, doubtless, will outlast my time;
And while there are Niggers, and plenty of slime,
And an excellent appetite is not a crime
To be punished by summary iron or load-
(I strongly object to a shot through the head);
While those plaguy Britons are not so darned quick
With their LIVINGSTONES, STANLEYS, and BAKERS (Old Nick.
In the form of a Crocodile, catch them, say I!)
And Governments do not too earnestly try
To abolish that excellent system of slavery,
I'm really haunted by little misgiving
As to my being able to pick up a living.
That last pickaninny was truly most savoury-
Wish I knew where to drop upon just such another,
Dear little black boy, had you ever a brother?
Well, here goes-W00-0-s-h, oosh!
There, that's nice and soft-s-q-u-0-0-s-h!
What a comfort there is in a luke-warm mud-douche !
But Love's a delusion, and Beauty is hollow !
From swallow to wallow, from wallow to swallow,
That's the true summer life for a Cayman to follow !

THE CHAUNT OF THE CROCODILE.
A Song for Saurians-biped and otherwise.
I GRUNT in my slime, and I cheerily sing-
Though I may not appear the most lyrical thing
In the round of Creation,
Still song 's my vocation,
And I've quite syren powers of vocalisation-
But the mud is so soft to my elegant form,
And the air is so bland, and the sun is so warm,

Though Directors did all that Directors could do,
Weighed the evidence well, pros and cons on each side,
And called in physicians of eminence too ?
Then pronounced 'twas for want of fresh air the brutes died !
Come list, while Punch states the case briefly to you.
Of ARNOTT's opinion with nail and with tooth
Some Directors fell foul-said that, even if sooth,
It could not be for want of enough of good food;
They feasted on all that caged quadrumans should,
A physician was bound to have wrapped up the truth
On apples and carrots, as much as they would,
In terms scientific, abstruse, and uncouth.
Nuts, any giv'n quantities-more than was good.
But the less scientific Directors replied,
Facts were facts: Monkeys payed them that lived, not that died.
They had plenty of room too for taking their flings,
So they carried a vote that fresh air be supplied,
And all sorts of perches, rope-ladders, and swings,
Through netted wire openings—so high and so wide.
For Léotard feats and incredible springs,
In which legs, arms, and tails did the office of wings.
Soon the blue-nosed baboons ceased to look extra blue,
The Howlers set up their old hullabaloo-
When the sunshine was warm and the weather was fair,
Macaques, Lemurs, Loris, sprang, climbed, swung, and flew,
They'd a large summer cage open free to the air,
And the quadrumans no more died off at the Zoo !
Round which pretty nurse-maids loved well to repair,
With their juvenile charges, at Simie to stare.
P'raps if the Trustees to this case would attend,
And take measures the air their clerks breathe to amend-
When the cold weather came, they were shut up in glass,
As men's healths on the same laws as monkeys' depend-
Through which no breath of air was permitted to pass ;
The same means at the Mu would produce the same end !
And as Monkeys are creatures who make their own gas,
Ammoniacal compounds were sure to amass.

HE Curtain is up! The choric opening movement of Lords and Commons round the Woolsack-answering to the
Thymele of the Dionysiac Theatre-has been performe'. The Actors have put on their masks—this is the only
theatre in which these classic appliances are still worn-and the first speech of the ancient play-the QUEEN'S-
has been duly delivered. This tirade-or rhema as the Greeks called such “screeds "-- is always more ceremonial
than serious, and this year, when no one anticipates a performance of lively interest, or stirring incident, its
ceremonial character seemed more apparent even than usual.
The LORD CHANCELLOR performed the part of Queen "for this occasion only." He would have pleased
Polonius. The Speech in his mouth was "well spoken, with good emphasis and good discretion." Still the
performer would have a better chance of giving his words with effect, had they been thrown into a more rhythmic and pointed form-say
something in this fashion-
'Mid peace abroad, prosperity at home,
Slav'ry, once chained, to keep in chains we mean.
Gladly once more to the Old House we come!
Japan and China near a break have been.
Brussels' War Conferences were a snare,
Look out for smashes when they come to jar-
Our Russian friends won't again catch us there.
But WADE (wise buffer) came 'twixt them and war.

Poor Spain may well be thankful for a Crown!

WHAT may not GARIBALDI do,

Having made Italy anew,
He'd fain re-make the Tiber.
What things that stream of yellow mud
Has seen and done-good gracious!
Since o'er its swiftly flowing flood
Swam the renowned HORATIUS.
The stream was rushing thiek and fast,
The wind was blowing rawly,
When o'er the stream HORATIUS passed,
Just to oblige MACAULAY.
Bravely the hero hastened home,
After his feat audacious;
Later came Lays of Ancient Rome,
Just to oblige HORATIUS.
Now Rome receives with open arms

Kaiser's and Pope's—to zero.
When GARIBALDI's stroke of flame

To VICTOR's broad, tanned forehead came
The crown from fool's head tumbled.
Now Italy is calm and cool,
And laughs at imbecility,
And leaves the Pope, a Jesuit tool,
To vouch Infallibility.

Made Kings and Cabinets shiver,
As Revolution's grown absurd,

CHARLES LAMB'S CENTENARY.
“February 10, is the centenary of the birthday of CHARLES
LAMB. It is thought that this offers a fit opportunity to establish
some memorial of him in his old school, where, I am ashamed to
say, no visible trace of him exists.”—Letter of G.C. BELL (Head
Master of Christ's Hospital) in the Times.
DEAR ELIA, born a hundred years ago,
How through and through your quiet life we know:
How we delight in those quaint essays, made
Out of soul-sunlight conquering life-shade:
How we enjoy your happy style, sore sated
Of large words with but little meaning weighted :
How every one who reads your prose or rhymes,
Feels to you as a comrade of those times,
That heard you pun and stammer out your joke,
And breathed the fragrance of your curling smoke :
For never reader could your Essays end,
Without the thought, "Dear Elia is my friend !”
Now the Head-Master of that famous school,
Where once you writhed 'neath flagellating rule,
And, when birch-rod produced accordant hymn,
Enyied unpunishable cherubim,
Writes to the Times - says briefly, “Let us do
Something for that dear ancient brilliant Blue.”
Punch says the same, for through the world who knows
So exquisite a master of sweet prose,
So beautiful a dreamer, though the sky
To which you soared was not immensely high;
So subtle an observer of all things
Kindly and quaint, with old-world colourings.
What though the playful fancies of your pen
Be your memorial in the hearts of Men,
'Tis sad to know, where a boy-blue you played,
Within the churchyard where your bones are laid,
Your grave neglected, and your schoo-lroom wall,
Without a stone your memory to recall!

For wits such as we with the mob may not mix-

Away with the dullard rumbustical rant !

Though Grundys and Gamps may be loud in lament;
Though partisan spite-spitters, weekly or daily,
May stomach their snubbings with sore discontent.

With speeches forgotten, and leaders unread;
For dulness-plus-venom you don't care a tizzy,

On which side soever that party may sit;
And banter as bright as the beam of Astarte
Will whelm that poor wight in a whirlpool of wit.

MR. A. EGERTON,

the opinion of those most able to judge,
"not considerable."
In spite of a threatening question
POTTERY
from CHEVALIER O'CLERY, Her Majesty's
Ministers have determined to recom-
mend HER MAJESTY to recognise the ex-
isting Government of Spain.
MR. SULLIVAN had a happy hour-
quite after his own heart-of tempest
in a tumbler over MB. LOPES's descrip-
tion of the Home-Rulers in the House
of Commons as a “disreputable band.”
He took occasion to rake up an after-
dinner speech of SIB JOHN CASTLEY, in
which that worthy Lincolnshire Baronet had
painted the same party in colours more faithful
than flattering. But the well of Truth is, some-
times, one of those wells which are best let alone.
The jovial Baronet having had the good taste to
withdraw what he had the bad taste to blurt
out, MR. SULLIVAN ascribed the withdrawal to
the polite inquiries of an Irish military friend of
the CHEVALIER O'CLERY—"as to the state of his
health, more particularly his trigger-finger."
MR. DISRAELI complimented the honour-
able Member for Louth on his “glowing
rhetoric," only complaining that it was too long, and deprecated turning after-dinner speeches into matters of privilege. In fact,
most good speeches, including his own, were after-dinner speeches (Irish Members, we should have thought, would have been the
Jast to complain of a little post-prandial licence). He recommended MR. LOPES to disclaim all personal imputation, which MR.
LOPES rather sulkily did; and the tempest in a tumbler, raised by MR. SULLIVAN, at once subsided, to leave time for a long talk over
the Second Reading of the Unwholesome Dwellings Bill, which had better have been kept for Committee, fixed for the 4th of March.
Tuesday.-A day not to be marked with a white stone in the Parliamentary Register, for it brought news of the Return of
DR. KENEALY (shall we say, as the Englishman says, the great and good ?) for Stoke-upon-Trent, and of JOHN MITCHELL, the escaped
convict of 1852, for Tipperary. The ill-news was soon buzzed through the lobbies,
"And M.P.'s stood dumb,
Or whispered with white lips, "The two; they come, they come !''
But business must be got on with, even under the cloud of such an invasion. MR. WARD HUNT eased the anxious mind of MR. E. REED,
who is afraid that the new religious service on the christening of H.M.'s ships may interfere with their launching. The prayers will be
so timed as not to interfere with ways, wedges, or dogshores.
England will not be sorry to learn that Britannia is not going to postpone her Arctic enterprise till she can induce Germania,
Scandinavia, or Russia to climb the Pole along with her.
SIR J. ASTLEY, Lincolnshire Bart., the bold speaker whose picture of the Home-Rulers, painted in rich after-dinner colours, was
yesterday held up to the House by MR. SULLIVAN, feels natural anxiety lest those who do not know him for a soldier might think he
had been frightened by an Irishman. So he read the letter which was supposed to have frightened him, and his answer to it,
explaining, at the same time, that, feeling he was wrong, he had said so, but emphatically not under terror of CHEVALIER O'CLERY'S
possible pistol. That, in fact, was an O'Clerical error. ASTLEY's was as rapid an act as SULLIVAN'S was lengthy; and the blunt
simplicity of the Lincolnshire Baronet contrasted refreshingly with the blatant rhetoric of the Irish journalist.
MR. NEWDEGATE asked and got leave to bring in his hardy annual, the Bill for putting Monks and Nuns under inspection. Second

on the tails of neglectful or over-exalted parsons-and of SIR H. JAMES's, for clipping the charges of Parliamentary returning-officers,
which now fly decidedly too high.
Then, tidings of the Tipperary Election having reached Westminster with the proverbial speed of ill news, MR. HART DYKE moved for
the papers necessary to prove JOHN MITCHELL a convicted felon, who has neither received the Royal Pardon nor served out his sentence,
and is therefore disqualified for M.P. Taking “Dyke" in its north-country sense of “barrier," the work of barricading the House
against felonions entry fell into the right hands. Some of the Irish Members talked of “indecent haste," and divided, against

AFTER-DINNER SPEECHES.
“WHEN the wine is in, the wit is out;"-
Only to dolts the adage reaches.
| No wise man could for a moment doubt
The value of after-dinner speeches.
Punch can remember the time when PEEL,
Whose wisdom still the country teaches,
After steak and port, his nine o'clock meal,
Made the best of after-dinner speeches.
When the Ministers come to the Mansion
House,
(The King of London their presence be-
seeches),
No guest who has any touch of nous
Will be weary of after-dinner speeches.
When the Royal Academy blooms in May,
With its pretty girls and their cheeks like
peaches,
Who won't, on the opening Saturday,
Listen to after-dinner speeches ?
When there's aught that's generous to be
done,
A greeting to pay that no soul impeaches,
A dinner's the best thing under the sun,
And its gold coin the after - dinner
speeches.
And as to the House, which often suffers
From talk that to dreariest platitude
reaches,
It does not often allow its duffers
To make long after-dinner speeches.

KNAVES OF SPADES.
(In re Boss and Byfuss against the World.)
If you call a spade a spade,
What a blunder you 'l have made !
Say "a horticultural tool,”
Blunt for knave and sharp for fool.
Phrase which no offence contains,
While the spade a spade remains.
Spades, to them that call them spades,
Mostly prove vindictive blades.
Spades, so-called, have many a friend ;
Aid oft Judge and jury lend,
When high damages are prayed
By the spade that's called a spade.
There's a House, wherein to name
Spade a spade is to defame.
"Spade" is, of all terms that be,
Most unparliamentary,
And the word, howe'er exact,
Is a term you must retract.
He that's forced his words to eat,
Has the very worst of meat;
That's the least that can befall
Those who rashly spade dare call
Any spade within that place,
Though of spades you call him Ace.
Yet a man by worth and weight,
A right worthy magistrate,
Spades called truly spades can scout,
Kicking the complainants out.

he has no love for
them at best. We fear they are democratic
inventions-levellers socially as well as mecha-
nically, bringing dukes and ditchers under the
same iron rules.
LORD JOHN MANNERS, who has been proving
that if “Manners makyth man," he can un-
make men of letters, explained that his late
dismissal of five letter-sorters was not for Oliver
Twist's offence of “asking for more," but for
allying themselves with professional agitators
out of doors, and fomenting agitation within.
Firebrands can't be tolerated in the Post-Office,
the contents of which are eminently combustible,
particularly when brought in contact with the
non-contents. LORD John is not a likely man to be harsh or
hasty, and we should think the odds are that any punishment he
inflicts has been well earned.
MR. WAIT asked the question England has waited to have
answered, whether the Admiralty had refused LADY FRANKLIN'S
prayer to have her gallant husband's last representative and
nephew, an officer of pith and promise, appointed as sub-lieu-
tenant to the Arctic expedition—the only favour she ever asked
of Government. MR. WARD-HUNT pleads guilty. It was
decided that only two sub-lieutenants should be appointed.
Great care was taken to choose the fittest of the forty-four
who volunteered. It was impossible, for such a service, to let sen-
timent prevail over other considerations. Had there been more sub-
lieutenants, LIEUTENANT FRANKLIN would have been chosen.
Now it ought not to be necessary to remind MR. WARD-HUNT that
there is such a thing as "natural selection." It pointed to LIEU-
TENANT FRANKLIN. From a good, by such a plea on his behalf he
became the best, man for the work. Sentiment should have been allowed to prevail-even to the extent of appointing a third
sub-lieutenant, if necessary. What harder slap in the face to English good-feeling could the late Government, so abused for subordina-
tion of sentiment to service, have inflicted ?So like LOWE-or AYRTON," people would have said. Let us hope MR. WARD-HUNT has
not heard the last of it.
Officers who want to shirk the disagreeables, say of Indian service, are in the habit of exchanging with those in whose eyes Indian
pros, in the shape of extra pay and allowances, outbalance the cons. The War Office must now approve, not only of such exchanges, but
the terms of them; and the money that passes between the exchangers is at present limited to actual expenses. MR. HARDY moved the
Second Reading of a Bill to put the money-part of the transaction out of War Office ken, leaving the barterers free to settle their own
terms. The change has the strong and unanimous recommendation of LORD CARDWELL'S Purchase Commission, including LORD JUSTICE
JAMES and LORD PENZANCE.
Is this opening the back door to Purchase, barred out at the front ?
MR. TREVELYAN thinks so, and MR. Lowe, and both spoke their minds strongly. It is a natural suspicion, and Punch feels with
them a spontaneous horror of again admitting Purse-thrust out with such difficulty, and at a cost of seven millions-into the field of
Promotion. Is the attempt but one more proof of the melancholy truth-Nummos expellas furca, tamen usque recurrent ? But it is the
poor man who will profit by the change, and who prays for it. There seems no question of that. If Doctors differ, it is not the Military
Doctors. They are all for the Bill. It is the Civil Doctors who shake their heads at it. The weight of evidence seems against them.
The report is very decided, and comes from men with a stronger bias against Purchase than for it. It is difficult to resist conclusions
thus strenuously pressed :-
“It has been repeatedly and forcibly urged upon us that the prohibition of paying and receiving money for exchanges between officers on full pay
is a serious hardship to some and a serious loss to others. It does appear to us that the complaint is a legitimate one. The new rule has obviously proceeded
from an apprehension that to allow any pecuniary bargaining between officers in respect of their commissions might be as a letting out of the waters,

SOLD!
A SONG OF SIMPLE SIMONY.
(Respectfully dedicated to the BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH.)
SOLD, sold, our living is sold,
The verdant pastures, the sheep and the fold,
To a Parson in an "all-rounder."
No one asks, is he High, is he Low?
One thing alone they care to know,-
He's a real ten-thousand-pounder.
Nobody asked could he pray, could he preach,
Could he the lore of his Master teach?
Only-and this seems funny, -
Unlike those Twelve without purse or scrip,
The anxious question on every lip
Was, “ Has he come down with the money?"
He may be a sapient theolog,
May be a roystering, rollicking dog,
Or as a Quaker steady;
May in the pulpit be sharp or flat, -
Vendor or agent never asked that,
They asked, had he got the ready ?
He had. He paid them down his gold,
And the whole of the "snug concern" is sold
Tannies

(Monday, March

lities about the

seemed to be that
the SPEAKER
should have to
commit any Hon-
ourable Member
for misbehaviour,
or the House to
throw itself on the
arms of its Ser-
jeant for protec-
tion. But in these
days of Home-
Rule and House-

that their chief
Executive Officer
is not likely to fail
of the suaviter in
modo, or to fall
short of the fortiter in re, should it be necesary to defend the
dignity of the House against assaults from without, or from
within. So MR. DISRAELI was not without full warrant for the
Ultra-Disraelitish solemnity with which he announced that
HER MAJESTY, as a gracious favour to her faithful Commons,
had been pleased to appoint, in lieu of LORD CHARLES RUSSELL
-retired in a blaze of regards and regrets—CAPTAIN GOSSETT,
the esteemed, respected, and popular Deputy-Serjeant of thirty-
eight years' standing-or, more strictly speaking-sitting. CAPTAIN GOSSETT has surely
earned his “stripes” by this time-as fully as LORD CHARLES his good-service pension.
With the “stars,” which the latter ought to be specially empowered to wear, Punch
would have united the “stripes," which he has so mercifully, yet so manfully, admin-
istered, whenever called on, throughout his long tenure of office.
Then the House settled itself to hear SIR M. H. BEACH-Fagus indefa(ti)gabilis-
describe, with a little too much leafage, as a BEACH's verbiage may fairly be called, the
legal strait-waistcoat, by help whereof the Government hope to keep Irish tenants from blowing out
their landlords' brains, and Irish factions, sects, and parties from breaking one another's heads, for
the time being. In sum and substance, their proposal is to continue, with modifications, the Act
relating to the free possession of arms; to dispense with the Acts dealing with persons abroad at
night in specially proclaimed districts; to allow the Act for the summary seizure and suppres-
sion of newspapers to expire (to be re-enacted if its repeal is abused); to maintain for two years
the Protection of Life and Property Act; and to renew the Acts against Unlawful Oaths.
The Opposition, by LORD HARTINGTON, said ditto to the Government.
MR. Shaw, MR. POWER, MR. RONAYNE, LORD ROBERT MONTAGUE, and SERJEANT SHERLOCK, in the name of Ireland, protested against
Irishmen being treated like children. More's the pity, says Punch, that Irishmen should behave like children, and that the necessity of
treating them as such should be proved by the fact that while the strait-waistcoat is kept hanging over her head-for to do her justice,
tbere is very seldom occasion to use it-our troublesome little Irish sister behaves herself, but, so soon as it is put into the closet, begins
kicking and biting and blunderbussing as viciously as ever.
The Home-Rulers could not keep up the talk against the truth longer than half-past eight, when they shut up, and the Bill was
read a Second Time nem.-con.
Tuesday.—MR. Cross is able to reassure MR. NEVILLE-GRENVILLE (who is uneasy on the subject), that the interments of illus-
trious dead in Westminster Abbey are not frequent enough to endanger the health of the Congregation or the stability of the
foundations. A Campo Santo, outside, would come too expensive. Besides, the Abbey is our Valhalla. Burial in an external cloister
would look like being left out in the cold not half such “snug lying" there, as in the Abbey, to quote Sir Lucius O'Trigger.
MR. Cross, in answer to a volley of interrogatories, administered a well-deserved wigging to DR. HARDWICK, for his outrageous viola-
tion of sense and decency in forcing an utterly uncalled-for inquest on the remains of SIR CHARLES LYELL. If this zeal according to
indiscretion were not quite exceptional, “it would become necessary to clip the wings of Coroners"-a sentiment the House ap-
plauded.
MR. FAWCETT rose to move that it is undesirable that Little HODGE in the country should have less schooling than Little GUTTERBLOOD
in the town. And so it is, and it is well that the House and England should feel it, and ponder it, and think hard how best to alter it.
En attendant, LORD SANDON pleads for time. The present Agricultural Education Act has only been in operation for eight months,
and it is too soon to be pulling up the blade to see how the grain is growing. No harm, all the same, in being a little anxious, con-

0, MR. PUNCH! Now, wasn't it a shame of them to
laugh at that dear darling, SERJEANT SHERLOCK, when
he brought forward his Notion (I fancy that's the pro-
per word) -
"That it is expedient to remove the grating in front of
the Ladies' Gallery."
You can't think what a blessing it would be to us poor
caged and cooped-up creatures, who feel like that poor
darling of a starling in the Sentimental Journey, inclined
to sing "I can't get out!” when we go into the House.
Besides half stifling us, you know the grating really grates
upon our nerves. And then it stops the sound so, we
can hardly hear the speeches, unless we keep our ears
on tiptoe, as it were, and try with all our might. I'm
sure the House would look much nicer if the grating
were removed, for it hides our pretty dresses, and our
pretty faces, too, and prevents the fact of our presence
being felt. If the ladies were but seen, although not
allowed to speak, they might hope to have some influence
on the course of a debate. I should so like to applaud
when I won't say who is speaking; and I think the
savage rustling of our indignant fans would frighten
odious men from calling us mere persons, as they some-
times do when talking of the fairer sex.

IN MEMORIAM.
Sterndale Bennett. Charles Lyell.
(DIED FER. 1, 1875, AGED 59.) (DIED FEB. 22, 1875, AGED 77.)
Buried in Westminster Abbey, Saturday, Feb. 6, and
Saturday, Feb. 27.
Two sisters strew with flowers two neighbouring graves,
And each between those graves her blossoms shares :
Art from her BENNETT's wreaths for LYELL saves,
Science from LYELL's crowns for BENNETT spares.
Art that serves Beauty, Science that serves truth,
Are kindred maids of mistresses akin.
This frail musician, whose creative youth
Pointed to heights he did not live to win,
And this unhasting and unresting sage,
Whose eye in lowly reverence read the ground,
Alike in Music's chords, and Earth's scored page,
Record of the Creator sought and found.
'Tis well that they should sleep here, side by side,
Among their fellows of the glorious choir-
By PURCELL, he, and HANDEL, who with pride
May welcome this last master of the lyre :
By WOODWARD, he, and HUNTER, and by him
The highest, humblest seeker of them all,
NEWTON-for to such race of Anakim
He brings not strength unmeet or stature small.
Sleep sweetly, modest master of sweet sounds,
Grey reader of the rocks and seas and sands-
While the great spheres make music in their rounds,
And earth's change broadens on through times and lands.
LEYDEN V. SCHIEDAM.
THE Ghost of Cats* writes to us :-
“As a disembodied spirit, conversant with spirits, I am in the
best position to know how some of the Special Correspondents of the
London Press at the late Tercentenary Festival of the University of
Leyden discharged their duty, by studying Leyden at Schiedam, and
finding more interest in a Schiedam bottle than in a Leyden jar.
The only night one of these envoys passed at Leyden, he retired early
to his bed-room to consult the spirits, in deference no doubt to
the impression that Hollands must be the proper medium through
which to look at Holland and the things thereof-including its
Universities. In this instance, unluckily, the spirits consulted seem
to have led him to see half instead of double,' for certainly the
famous old University and its Festival never before loomed so small
as in the report of this representative of British journalism.
“When reading the sensible reports of the Journal des Débats,
Kölnische Zeitung, and, among English journals, the Academy, the
Ghost of Cats cannot but wonder how English' journals of high
standing could have entrusted the task of representing them at the
Tercentenary of his Leyden Alma Mater to such ambassadors. If
John BULL knew how heartily the Dutch sympathise with English
literature and English character, manners, and customs, he would
be more solicitous about the deportment of Britannia to the Dutch
Minerva. Oxford, he learns from a recent paragraph in the Times,
has been fain to apologise to the Senatus Academicus of Leyden for
the neglect of her Vice-Chancellor even to acknowledge its in-
vitation to the Tercentenary Celebration. Better late than never.
“Considering all that Leyden has done for Scientific Law, Lite-
rature, and free opinion-the illustrious students it has reared, the
famous Professors it has fostered, the noble champions of 'free
thought it has sheltered, methinks," says our Ghost, and we quite
agree with him, "she has a right to more cordial and respectful recog-
nition than she has found from England on her last Tercentenary."

century.

A EUROPEAN sensation has been created by the Bill framed in
opposition to the POPE's late Encyclical by the Prussian Government.
It authorises the stoppage of the salaries of Priests repudiating the
new ecclesiastical laws, and practically suspends the Bull De Salute
Animarum. LUTHER burnt the POPE's Bull, but to suspend it was
reserved for BISMARCK. Fancy the Papal Bull suspended, as it
were a ram over a draper's shop! Suspending a Bull with the
strong arm is an exploit worthy of a Hercules, a Theseus, or a Milo
of Crotona. Perhaps some patriotic German sculptor will repre-

Thames studies at Oxford)—yet I suffer enormously-unspeakably-by
anticipation, being so peculiarly, and unfortunately, nervous. Such an
imagination as I have, too, all through my nerves! Wasn't this known
to the ancients? Of course it was. Didn't ÆSOP select me-I mean one
of our race-(bother that word "race ! ” as it brings me back, willy-nilly,
to the subject of my present complaint-a complaint worse than my normal
rheumatics and chronic cramp-but to proceed)-didn't ÆSOP, I say, select
one of our kind as exemplifying imagination? Wasn't it the height of
fancy, in a Frog, to imagine he could ever swell himself out into a Bull ?
And for the Aristophanic Frogg-well, I'll engage that your poor friend here, meaning myself, who is obliged to fly for his life before
the invading hordes of outer barbarian Cockneys and cads, knows more about those Aristophanic-not, by any means, Aristocratic
- Frogs, than any four in the two eights who are preparing to row their blessed-(you know what I mean)-race, on this dear,
charming, delightful, dirty, picturesque, muddy, aromatic, stinking, pleasant old River Thames.
I protest. Sir, to you, I protest, in the name of all the inhabitants on the Right and Left, on the Extreme Right and the Extreme
Loft, and of the Centre of these troubled waters, I do protest.
Here's a good day for Airting and finery, and a bad 'un for Frogs! I hate flirting. I've settled down ever so long ago; in fact,
I've been thoroughly domesticated, since the days when Froggee would a-wooing go, whether his mother would let him or no, after
which I married MISS ALICE (related, of course, to the pretty young lady who passes so much of her time in Wonderland, and went
through a looking-glass), who is now ALLY CROAKER.
No more flirting for me or for her. A family of Tadpoles demand our care; waggle go their heads, and wiggle go their tails all day;
and just when we'd settle down so comfortably among the Reeds (quite a Gallery of Entertainments, I assure you) we are turned out
neck and crop (not much of either to lose, by the way) and forced to fly, like the coloured tribes before the face of white men, only there

ILL-used birds of the air,

You may plead self-defence in this nice nipping weather ;
Resistance to plan
'Gainst your enemy, Man,
Or be birds, soon, of not e'en so much as a feather!
There's no ostrich so tall,
And no tom-tit so small,

No sea-bird nor land-bird,
No steppe, swamp, or strand bird,
But should put best wing forward against the invader.
The Greeks, more aesthetio,
Or more sympathetic
Than we, wore no plumes, their own tresses content with;
Even Rome stooped to spare
The poor birds of the air,
Though she spared little else that her Empire was blent
with.
Now, from Prince next the Throne,
Who boasts for his own
The three ostrich feathers, with Ich Dien for motto,
To the Red-Skin, full-drest,
Whose sea-eagle-tail crest
Shades lank-hair and hatchet-face stained with arnotto
From the gay militaire,
On whose coiffure de guerre
Waves the spoil of some bird's neck or back, train or
pinion,
To the Court-belle, and Caffre,
For feathers who chaffer,
One to stick in her wool, one to hoist o'er her chignon :
From the peacock's-plumed eyes,
With their green and gold dyes,
| To the shimmer and sheen of the humming-bird's gorget,
Twixt the Pole and the Tropic,

now-a-days, when everything is

referred to a Select Committee.
But in the Lords (Friday, March
12th) the DUKE OF RICHMOND
performed the now uncommon
feat of bringing a Bill out of,
instead of sending one into, a
Select Committee.
His so-called Tenant Right Bill
is a mild attempt at securing for
tenants compensation for unex-
hausted and authorised improve-
ments of their holdings. It is
the outcome of a Select Committee
obtained by MR. PHILIP PUSEY as
far back as 1848. Certainly, it
cannot be said that Government
has not taken time for "consider-
ation.”
The Duke apologised, almost
pathetically, for taking up their
Lordships' time in explaining his
Bill. Unfriendly critics might
call it a glaring example of “class
legislation," what with its classes
of improvements, classes of
owners, classes of tenants, classes
of customs, classes of notice, and
classes of procedure. But with
all these classes the Bill is not to
interfere with “ freedom of con-
tract” between class and class.
A. landlord and tenant may make a class for themselves,
outside of all these classes, and settle their terms of
holding according to the exigences of the one and the
needs or eagerness of the other. The Duke has got in
what he may fairly call the small end of the wedge.
Never was so small an offspring of so long an incuba-
tion. If Select Committees did not occasionally hatch
larger chickens, it is clearly not to their breeding qualities
that they owe their present popularity.
In the Commons, MR. RATHBONE's complaint of the
undigested state in which Acts of Parliament are found
in the maws of Consolidation Acts, like the contents of
a tar's pocket in a shark's stomach, was met by the
universal recipe-reference to Select Committee.
SIR J. MCKENNA tried to prove that Ireland is unfairly taxed.
MR. LOWE nailed the fallacy on which his argument rested. It is not Ireland that is taxed, but Irishmen, and Irishmen pay less than
Saxons. Besides, SIR JOHN, think how Irishmen are allowed to tax the patience of the Saxon in and out of the House.
MR. T. BRASSEY wants another Commission on the practice of Marine Insurance, which might, from one view of its consequences,
be best described as “scuttling made profitable." But strange to say the Commission was not granted as prayed. MR. BRASSEY should
have asked for a Select Committee, “ Ça ne se refuse pas," as the French phrase runs.
MR. O'CONNOR POWER asked for a general amnesty for the Irish “political prisoners," a phrase which in Irish covers Manchester
murderers and soldiers who have been false to their oath. We need not say the request was refused" with regret," as MR. Cross said,
but with determination.
Monday.-(Lords.) LORD SELBORNE tried to put a back-bone of compulsory registration into LORD CAIRNS' Land Titles and Transfer
Bill, but without effect. “Inexpedient and impracticable," says the LORD CHANCELLOR. "We don't make laws to compel people to
do what they don't like.” That's our notion of "harassing legislation.” We had thought till now that three-fourths of the statutes were
passed for precisely that purpose. But all Bills now-a-days are to be Permissive Bills-except the one SIR WILFRID LAWSON wants.
(Commons.) CAPTAIN PIM is going to pick holes in MR. E. J. REED's ships, and to ask (of course) for a Select Committee to help him.
Take care, CAPTAIN PIM; MR. E. J. REED wields a pen in the Press as well as a tongue in Parliament, and his assailants coats may prove
as easy to pick holes in as his ironclads. Nobody believes in himself—and his ships-more absolutely than the late Chief Constructor of
the Navy. If he and MR. BESSEMER together put down sea-sickness in the Channel, who is there they mayn't feel strong enough to put
down on dry land ?
Then we had the debate on the Second Reading of the Regimental Exchanges repeated on the Bill going into Committee. But the
Bill "has got to be passed,” as the Yankees say, and argument and amendment are alike idle. Great wrath of the Guards Officers
and their organs at MR. GOSCHEN'S City way of looking at things, when he charged the Officers of the Household troops, in the words of
a Guards Colonel, with selling “their prestige and their privileges.”
Perish the thought! “ Non cauponantes bellum, sed belligerantes" is these indignant warriors' description of themselves.
Still, an exchange into the Guards does command a higher price than any other sample of the article; and what is the fancy price
for, if not for “prestige and privileges ?" No doubt, it was very rude in MR. GOSCHEN to apply City terms to a high military
transaction.
Tuesday.-(Lords.) Poor LORD LYTTELTON was very pathetic, in his grim, serio-comic fashion, on the cold shoulder given by the
Government to his Bill for Bishops by Voluntary Contribution. Of course, said LORD SALISBURY, Government could not be expected to
be responsible for the Bill, because they could not be confident as to its practical working.
LORD KIMBERLEY very rudely wanted to know if Government had any opinion on the subject. “Any opinion," indeed! Far toc
many opinions to be pleasant.

THE NEW FOREST.
“LORD HENRY JOHN MONTAGU-DOUGLAS-Scott on Tuesday
evening, March 17, obtained a Select Committee to inquire into
the enclosure of the New Forest."
"In the following pages,” says Peacock, in the preface to
DJUDI
Gryll Grange, “the New Forest is always mentioned as if it were
still unenclosed. This is the only state in which the Author has
been acquainted with it. Since its enclosure he has never seen
it, and purposes never to do so."
PUNCH thanks you, scion of the bold BUCCLEUCH,
Now, when our need of elbow-room is sorest,
For bearding the utilitarian crew

But breeds its legends plenteous as its throstles,
Which sing in summer hours sweet interludes

"THE Guards," their ardent champion affirms,
What myriads pour along the shore, by foot and wheel and rail,
What myriads teem on Thames' broad stream, by oar and screw and sail;
Are sweetly ignorant of “ City terms."

Of England's sons the champions for pluck and blood and bone,
Beneath the flag of Mammon e'er will muster ?

Pooh! pooh! it really is quite too funny
To talk to military swells of-Money!
How fair they show, trained fine to row, those sixteen striplings strong; “Purchase !” The word is destitute of meaning
Just weight enough, no ounce of stuff but helps their ship along.
To militaires--they would not stoop to gleaning
Each coxswain yare, with yoke-lines square, each boat on even keel,
In Trade's Tom Tiddler's ground, or-scarcely worse-
And level laid each stout ash-blade, held in a grasp of steel.

Where is the gallant Guardsman who could tell
A hush, a word, more felt than heard, twice eight oars dip like one,
The esoteric civic sense of “Sell” ?
The lithe boats leap, the ash-blades sweep, and flash 'twixt stream and sun; Or where the beau sabreur could bear the onus
A steady swing of backward fling, and home-pulled forward stroke,
Of being called on to define a "bonus"?
With all the aid that tough ash-blade demands from heart of oak.
“ Charges" they understand, but only those
Made in the field against their country's foes ;
'Tis either's race, so timed the pace, so equipoised the strength-
And comrades who should prate of loss or profit,
No, bow and bow are severed now, a quarter-half-a length-
They'd doubtless send to Coventry-or Tophet.
Now Cambridge slows, cool Oxford rows, but still 'tis well-pulled all,
How sweet and solacing it is to find
And no oar drags, no courage flags, from stroke to coxswain small.
The glorious modern military mind
What boots to tell the sink and swell of challenge-shout and cheer,
As wholly free from mercenary taint
Of hot blood's rush as fade and flush alternate hope and fear;
As that of any peaceful, purseless Saint !
How very nice to know there's yet a place
Of bright eyes filled, and hot hopes chilled, as, 'gainst the keen north wind,
Where Honour still can show a stainless face :
The light-blue oars show, from the shores, more and more lengths behind ;

GIN!
(A Ballad for British Workmen.)
'Twas a British Working-man of the sort
That demagogues flatter and publicans court.
His nose was red, eyes watery and dull,
Till his pocket was empty his glass was full;
As with husky throat, through the tap-room's din,
He thus sung the praises of British Gin.
" As Briton and Working-man, my boast
Is to come of the race that should rule the roast;
And the seal of a Briton's rights and kin,
Is the sign of the tap where he takes his gin.
Hang the rot-gut tipple of German and French,
That won't make a man drunk though his skin he drench!
But give me my gin, and I'll soak my brain
While a brown I have left to pay for a drain.
Gin! Gin!
Fill up my skin,
With the liquor of liquors, Blue-ruinous Gin!
“They may call me a sot, but I care not a jot,
While happiness out of the quartern is got ;
They may prate of the pleasures and honours of work !
'Tis a slavery every good fellow should shirk.
Or if one must drudge for some twelve hours a day,
Since e'en good brother Bung will not part' without pay-
Let us haste to end labour, and pleasure begin,
In the warming embrace of toil's antidote-Gin!
Gin! Gin!
Work is wages of sin,
And its only sure solace is strong British Gin!
'Sobriety? Fudge ! he's a white-livered fellow,
Who hasn't the pluck to get muzzy or mellow.
A cove go home drainless to kids and their cries,
Or spare his old woman a brace of black eyes ?
Sheer slavery! Lose all the sweetness of life,
For a Sunday-best coat or a treat with one's wife?
Not for JOE! Him as makes should, by rights, spend the tin,
Let home go to blazes so I gets my gin!
Gin! Gin!
Where's the home worth a pin
To a jolly warm bar and a skinful of gin!
“Dignity ? Stuff! 'tis the bugbear of fools
Your right British Working-man scoffs at its rules.
Hand to cap for a drink, a cove's day's work to shorten,
What's the pride of a man to the price of a quarte'n?
If your breeches are thin, and your coat show the rub,
There's revivers for both at the very next pub'.
Let the foreigner flout, and aristocrat grin,
You may laugh them to scorn o'er a noggin of gin.
Gin! Gin!
For a hide that's too thin
There's no hard'ning mixture like strong British Gin!
“ Try to cut off a free Briton's lush! That's all bosh:
As well bid a hog say good-bye to its wash.
'Tis the be-all of bliss, and the end-all of life,
And better than dignity, health, home, and wife.
Our Paradise here is the Publican's bar;
The broad doors of that heaven stand always ajar:
So let's soak, till our souls are well steep'd in the draught,
'Tis the badge of our creed, and the sign of our craft.
Gin! Gin!
What are rights yet to win,
To the right to get mad-drunk on strong British Gin."
The clock struck BRUCE and Cross as the chorus died
The last quartern was drained, the bar-door was flung wide;
With fumbling fingers, that vainly searched
In å penniless pocket, the drunkard lurched
From the toper's Eden, turned neck and crop out,
And the British Working-man, free and stout,
Reeled to his home-home!--grimmest of quips
That ever passed the foul fiend's lips-
A pale woman shrinks to the drunkard's side,
Bruised-blackened-that British Working-man's bride!
That's Home incarnate! She'll scarce begin,
An Io-Pæan to British Gin.
What's the husband's greeting? Kick, curse, and blow!
Till, bruiser and bruised, down, a-heap, they go !
Now British Working-man, one more flagon
To Moloch the mighty, not Bel, but the Dragon-
And drink round his shrine, and roar your chorus,

But before they
broke up:-
In the Lords (Fri-
day, March 19th),
LORD KIMBERLEY felt
exercised to know
why the Agricultural

Act should fix eleven

the Towns' Elemen-
tary Education Act
fixes thirteen for

of the back-slums, as
the end of compulsory
school-days.
THE DUKE OF RICHMOND admitted, but did not explain it. He would
not promise legislation, but would '“ watch the working of the Act."
Punch sees a pretty picture : subject, The Duke watching the Working
of the Agricultural Children's Act. MR. MILLAIS is welcome to it, with
the line for the Catalogue
“Abroad in the meadows to watch the young cram."
Then their Lordships did the honours of First Reading to the Regimental
Exchanges Bill, and adjourned, much exhausted, for the Easter recess,
after a laborious night's work, ending at the late hour of twenty-five
minutes to six !
In the Commons, miscellaneous Friday fire of question and answer, after
the Head-master had promised that, if the school would be good boys,
and get through their Peace-Preservation Bill on Tuesday, the Easter Holidays
should run from that nigbt till the following Monday week!' SIR C. DILKE showed
up the weak parts in the Ballot Act machinery, which, in spite of the pains of SIR
H. JAMES and MR. FORSTER, seems very shaky indeed. SIR CHARLES followed suit of
the Session by asking for a Select Committee, which the ATTORNEY-GENERAL pro-
mised him-for next session. The fact is that, for this Session, there are neither members, rooms, nor clerks available for more Select
Committees.
MR. P. A. TAYLOR moved for a free pardon of LUKE Hills, a labourer, fined £5 and £3 188. costs, or three months' imprisonment,
for leaving a service which an employer swore was a hiring for a year, though Hills and his wife denied it, and there was no
written engagement. SIR H. JAMES pointed out that that alone invalidated the contract, on complainant's own showing; it was one to
commence at a future day, which by law requires writing. MR. CROSS fully admitted the hardship of the case, but explained that
the Crown could not pardon, as the man was committed for non-payment of damages. MR. P. TAYLOR deserves all credit for
bringing forward a really cruel act of magisterial oppression and an example of a statute put to ill-use. A few Members, to mark their
strong sense of this, have since subscribed to pay off the damages and costs for which Luke Hills was sent to gaol, and the case has,
we have little doubt, driven the last nail in the coffin of the Masters and Servants Act of 1867, under which the alternative of fine or
imprisonment was open to the Bench.
Then the House was treated to another grievance, perhaps not quite so substantial as that of LUKE HILLS, though we don't feel
quite sure as to that. SIR W. FRASER, in pathetio terms, complained of the cruel snub inflicted upon him by MR. CROSS,
when, the other night, he, a “humble and constant supporter of the Government,” having innocently asked whether it was right
that remanded prisoners should be made to scrub their own cells, MR. Cross jumped up in a tiff, and protested that that was not the
sort of a question to put to a HOME SECRETARY, and by look, manner, and matter, let loose a douche of derisive cheers from his minions
behind him on the head of the harmless and respectful questioner.
MR. DISRAELI hastened to apply one of his soft-sawder plasters to SIR W. FRASER's raw. But SIB. W. has reason to feel sore.
His question was quite a proper one. It is very hard that prisoners on remand, or waiting for bail, should be put on a level with con-
victed offenders, as to certain menial offices and personal indignities of the prison-house; and the HOME SECRETARY might be much
worse employed than in getting the regulations overhauled, at least in the prisons under his authority.
Then the House went into Committee on the Artisans' Dwellings Bill, attacking, in business-like fashion, the ten pages of Amend-
ments on the paper. MR. CROSS was unusually stiff in the back, holding his own with rare tenacity. MR. FAWCETT was evidently out
of temper with the Bill, which he says has been turned into a paternally patronising one for 'providing dwellings for the Work-
ing Classes," which vexes me”-as MR. PEPYS would have said. " What are • Working Classes p1" asks MR. FAWCETT. “Does the
term include Carates and Clerks on small salaries ?" Altogether, the excellent and strenuous Member for Hackney was, what the
“Working Classes ” would oall“ nasty," and what Mammas and Nurses call “fractious," throughout the Committee, and finally
blocked the Bill at half-past twelve,

of course, tried half to shirk, half to pooh-pooh the suggestion, but it is one that should be attended to. The Admiralty have a night-
bell and keep a night-Secretary for emergencies of nocturnal work on their premises, and why should not the Board of Trade ?
On the Second Reading of the Peace Preservation Bill, LORD R. MONTAGU supported a futile motion by a futile speech, after which

with the Fine Arts. Would not“ His Grace" be a fitter title for

NURSERY RHYMES NEW SET FOR THE TIMES.
THE COMING HAT.
“The Cardinal's Hat is always kept upon a
table, either in the Throne-room, or the ante-room
of his apartment." -Times, from an Occasional
Correspondent at Rome.
THERE is much more than this to be told
about the new Red Hat which is shortly ex-
pected to arrive in England.
The Hat will never be placed in a cup-
board, in a hat-box, or hung up in the hall,
on a hat-peg, or a hat-stand, but, as is
said in the Times, it will always be kept
either in the Throne-room orante-room on a
table (of Roman Mosaic) in a magnificent
cut glass case ornamented with precious
stones, and bearing the Cardinal's coat-
of-arms on the top.
The Hat will never be left alone: a Re-
tired Hatter will always be in attendance
upon it.
At dusk the Hat will be transferred to a
patent fire-resisting safe, and a Watchman
will be on duty all the night in the Hat-
chamber.
The Hat will have an establishment of
its own. There will be a Keeper of the Hat,
assisted by a Conservator of the Tassels, a
Secretary of the Hat, an Usher of the Hat,
four Hat-bearers, one for each quarter of
the year, and a Beadle. There will also be
a Hatter in Ordinary, to reside in London,

Whether POONIKER's self was the dropper
Of the diamond-dust ars'nic and copper
In PHAYRE's pomelo-juice,
To inquire 'tis no use,
On the charge now the Court's clapped a stopper.
But such poison was found (whether Palace's
Or POONIKER'S) proved by analysis,
So PHAYRE jumps to conclusion
The noxious infusion
A last touch of MULIAK-ROW's malice is.
And he wires, " The last game GAIKWAR tries on me,

SIR,
Then straightway LORD NORTHBROOK sent PELLY,
Who brought a cool head to the mêlée,

The GAIKWAR suspended,
Stirring India from Ceylon to Delhi.
A Commission was sworn in for trial
Of the point who had emptied that phial;
They found no end to swear,
To the “who, when, and where,"
But each oath had an oath in denial.

SERJEANT BALLANTINE fee'd as defender;
Who put PHAYRE through the mill
With such Old-Bailey skill,
He, not MULHAR-RÓW, seemed the offender.
The Commission found plots had been woven,
But the GAIKWAR's guilt voted “not proven;"
Where in such a mess mixed are
Rogue, liar, and trickster,
To doubt the best judge is behoven.
So scot-free of the charge, if not shriven,
MULHAR-ROW may be said to have thriven ;
Besides BALLANTINE's fee,
He wins fame over sea,
And PHAYRE from Baroda is driven.
For the names “MULHAR-ROW,” of the latter-
I mean “row,"—there's no want in this matter;
But for "muller," I fear,
No'er the GAIKWAR will hear
That name, without feeling its satire.
WHEN Halfpenny Post-cards were first started, we were justly
charged sixpence a dozen. To this, any one who had played cards
with fish-counters could have had no possible objection. But after we
had been allowed to discover what a saving in time and money the
new post-card was, when, to put it poetically, we had learnt to love
the pretty Post-office infant, and felt our inability to do without it,
| up went the price of the dozen to sixpence-halfpenny; presumably
for the benefit of the stationer. This year we can't buy our packet
of a dozen halfpenny post-cards under seven pence. I begin to regret
not having liberally invested in post-cards when they first came out
-they'd have paid better than even the Brighton Aquarium, or the
Langham Hotel at the present moment. The Post-card of 1875
would have paid me over fifteen per cent. on the original invest-
ment. Will they go up another halfpenny? If so, I feel strongly
inclined to buy for the rise. On the other hand, if people can only
get sixpence for their sevenpence, they'll take to writing fewer
letters, and the demand for post-cards will be sensibly – very
sensibly- diminished.

MR. SQUARETOES' SACRIFICE
TO THE MANCHESTER CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

Ice-bound in darkness, want, and cold,
No martyr of his crown should doubt,
More than did martyred Saints of old.
Otherwise 'twere more wise, I hold,
To die a martyr to the Gout.
Martyr, that's witness, to good things;
Their martyr through enjoyment free,
Whence, in due time, Dyspepsia springs,
And thence the pang this toe which wrings-
That twinge in it just now! Ah, me!
But yet if Science could appease
My pangs, my former health renew,
Wealth for the cure can find the fees,
Not so with victims of disease
Who poverty groan under, too.
There are infirmaries for such ;
And my subscription to bestow
On one of them won't hurt me much,
As does-0!-Ah!- the slightest touch
Of this unfortunate great toe.

To which peculiar help seems due.
Those helpless innocents ne'er won
Their own complaints, as we have done ;
Myself, I mean, friend, if not you.

I'm game to stand-a guinea, nay,
A sacrifice of several pounds,
Which plainly to great good redounds,
So won't be money thrown away.

" The annual tea-meeting and donkey-show of the costermongers connected
with the Golden Lane Missions was held on the 24th instant at the Foresters'
Hall, Clerkenwell. ... The event of the evening was the presentation of a
donkey to LORD SHAFTESBURY. The animal was with some difficulty driven
on to the platform, whence his Lordship, standing with his arm round its neck,
addressed the meeting. The Emily Club of costermongers presented LADY
Edit: ASALEY with a bouquet.”
(From the Philosopher's stand-point.)
Could there be better gift? The patient beast
Who bears the stiok, and will on thistles feast,
Yet in hard duty struggles to the end,
Is always grateful to a human friend,
But seldom finds such friend ; is roughly fostered
By costermongers, sellers of the costard,
Sellers of other things from door to door,
And very useful traders for the poor-
He bears a cross, we know; and legends say
Has borne, in memory of a wondrous day,
When love wrought miracles, in stress and strife,
And sick were healed, and dead men raised to life.
Since when, 'twixt hard knocks, hard words, and hard fare,
He and his owners both their cross must bear.
The Earl, who loves his race, loves other races :
He has sought evil out in darksome places,
And bravely grappled with its many arms,
And tamed its strength, and paralysed its harms.
Brought aid to weakness, moved dead weights away,
That crushed the soul down, deep, in mire and clay.
The greatest, by descending, may ascend :
The peer who is the costermonger's friend,
Dares on the platform stroke an ass's ears,
Rises above the level of his peers.
Though SHAFTESBURY's arm around a donkey's neck
Might prompt a laugh, all ridicule we check:
That donkey to Saint Giles's Park will pass,
To feed, and roll, his fill in lordly grass ;
Mounted by many a high-bred boy and girl,
And praised and petted by the kindly Earl.
What though the shade of the Cabal-list sneer,
At such bucolics, or that sager Peer, *.
Who of his age Characteristics penned,
And whom the best men of his time called friend,
Wander around Saint Giles's grey old hall,
On Asinus no fear of them will fall.
He'll let those pule ghosts form and fade in mist,
Nor prick an ear, till the philanthropist
Bring him the kindly carrot, or, more prized,
The thistle, of all beasts save him despised;
Then, though a creature who on rough fare feedeth,
He'll proudly bear the weight of LADY EDITI,
And wonder how from a foul coster's slum,
To honour in an Earl's park he has come.
(From the Costermonger's ditto.)
IF I had a Donkey what would go,
D'ye think he should drudge in a cart? O, no!
He should win me a prize, and I'd cry, “Brayvo!”
And“ Go it, Neddy!”.

7. On the delicate subject of Flirtation
it is impossible to lay down any hard and
fast rule. Perhaps your wisest plan will
be to go at once to Mamma, state the case
fully to her, and be guided implicitly by
her decision. We can say no more than
this, except that if you are sure that by a
little harmless pastime of this kind you can
promote the great object of the Bazaar, you
will not be doing very wrong by obeying
the dictates of benevolence and humanity.
8. Invest your money freely in Raffles,
and do not waste precious time by inquiring
what the article to be raffled for is, or how
much you are to pay for your chance of
success. You will know what you have
won when the prize is handed over to you,
and the amount you have to disburse will
be marked in plain figures when your name
is entered in the list. Bear in mind what
a great philosopher once said to his step-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ALL THE FUN OF THE FAIR.
In a recent advertisement of the London School-Board,
for school-masters and school-mistresses in Bermondsey,
it is stated that “candidates, invited to attend the
committee, will be allowed a second-class railway fair"
[sic]. As Mr. Punch has never had the good fortune to
be present at “a second-class railway fair,” his curiosity
has been powerfully excited by this advertisement. It
was his good fortune, when he was young, to see at a
fair the fascinating Miss BIFFIN, whose foot-writing-
for she had no hands or arms-was admired by every one
who saw it.
"Surely,” thought Mr. Punch, “there will be, at a
second-class railway fair, many persons, who, having
lost their limbs in a collision, and being thereby dis-
qualified for any feat of arms, have made their arms of
feet, and emulated the skill of Miss BIFFIN. Surely, at
such a fair, the Living Skeleton will be represented by
the Original Shareholder, whilst the Preference Bond-
holder will do duty for the Fat Woman of Tutbury.
The Merry-go-rounds will closely resemble the Board-
room Tables, and several able Managers, whose efforts to
reduce the value of railway shares have been attended
with complete success, will have charge of the Knock-
'em-downs."
But, while Nr. Punch thus meditated, there came one
to him, who said that what the London School-Board
meant to offer, and would have offered, if their Inspector
of Spelling had not been absent on sick-leave, was a
second-class railway fare.
"Dear me," said Mr. Punch, “have I been feeding
my imagination on such homely fare as this? If this be
so, get thee from my sight, Little London School-Board !
Fare forth, and seek thy fortune! Fare thee well, and,
if for ever, then for ever fare thee well.”

As we shall have spent four

millions and a quarter on

HARDY recommended the
House to be cautious. The caution would have
come better before we spent the money. Suppose
we have to give up muzzle-loading, after all, for
a better system of breech-loading than SIR W.
ARMSTRONG'S? The probability seems to lie in that
WI direction, and what of our money and our caution
then?
The appointment of a Colonial bishop as Chaplain-
General of the Forces, instead of one of the six
Senior Chaplains, all of long service and exemplary
deserts, was questioned, and not justified. All MR.
HARDY could say was that the Chaplain-General had some
quasi-episcopal functions, and therefore he thought an ex-
bishop would be the right man for the place. But we never
heard that Chaplain-General GLEIG showed a want of either
episcopal authority or unction. Is there any more reason why
any of the six Senior Chaplains might not have done all the
quasi-episcopal work required, whether in the way of confirm-
ing recruits, or wigging subordinate chaplains ? But the job is
jobbed; and there is no use trying to put a varnish on it.
Then the House got to the Army Estimates. SIR A. LUSK,
COLONEL GOURLEY, and some other amateur critics, did the usual amount of
nibbling and hobby-riding. Attention was called to some fine examples of
the favourite official game of shutting the door after the steed is stolen-as the
Beggar's Bush Barracks nuisance, the Crimean graves, and other cases in
which the timely expenditure of a few pounds would have saved thousands;
and the bulk of the Estimates was comfortably disposed of before midnight.
Tuesday. It is wonderful how frank and full a Minister can be in admitting
the faults of those over whom he has no control. The Jersey prisons are not
under Home Office inspection. A weakly girl of fourteen, sentenced to a month's imprisonment-balf of it solitary, on bread and water--
has died from disease accelerated by her punishment. Mr. Cross admitted the facts, regretted that the case should have occurred, and is
glad to think it cannot occur again. But Jersey must be allowed her full privilege of local mis-government.
LORD ROBERT MONTAGU has been saying disagreeable things about the Folkstone drainage, and has been accused at a public
meeting, by a gentleman in shirt-sleeves, with a turn for unparliamentary language, of “telling a pack of lies about the town."
LORD ROBERT did not propose to call the offender to the Bar of the House, sbirt-sleeves and all, but himself waxed so unparliamentary
in criticism of his critic, that he was pulled up by the SPEAKER.
MR. J. Holms tried, in vain, to prove to the House that brewers having been relieved of the Hop-duty ought to be relieved of the
Licence-duty imposed in its stead. The House declines to believe that brewers are too simple innocents to extract the amount of that,
or any other, duty out of their customers. The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER undertook to correct inequalities in the scale of duty
which make it press unfairly on small brewers, and so cut away the only ground MR. HOLMS had to stand on.
The Customs and Inland Revenue are to have the benefit of the Bank Holidays' Act; but the latter are to lose the Coronation Day,
and PRINCE OF WALES's Birthday, which they have now. In the Docks the holidays are to be permissive.
MR. NORWOOD thinks the Bank Holidays' Act an unwarrantable interference with the rights of labour. Punch thinks MR. NORWOOD's
an unwarrantable interference with the rights of play. MR. NORWOOD is of opinion that the working-classes have too many holidays as it
is. Mr. Punch begs to remind him that SIR J. LUBBOCK'S Bill did not institute Saint Monday, and that clerks and employers, at
all events, do not worship at the shrine of that saint of the working-man.
Before going into Committee on Sir H. JAMES's Bill for regulating Returning Officers' expenses, MR. FAWCETT was defeated on his
resolution for throwing election expenses on the rates, by 130 to 46. Neither side of the House wants a rush of impecunious candidates.

PRIL, coquette month of the year, plays with our hopes and fears ;

When she should beam her brightest, her sunniest face display.

Strange contrast with our Princess, the gracious and the gas :

Death in her iron throats, and death about her iron prow.

ELEMENTS OF MISCHIEF IN HYPOCRITICAL REPOSE.
“WHAT IS THE GERMAN FATHERLAND?"
(Freely translated from "Was ist der Deutschen Vaterland.")
RESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO PRINCE BISMARCK, AFTER READING HIS
RECENT NOTE TO THE BELGIAN FOREIGN OFFICE.
WHAT is the German Fatherland-
As BISMARCK seems to understand ?
The land that KAISER WILHELM schools
In Blood and Iron's rigid rules ?
0, no 1-0, no !-within that line
Fatherland would be clipped too fine.
What is the German Fatherland ?-
From Memel's Haf to Lubeck's strand ?
From Erz-Gebirge's rocky pile,
To Stralsund's forts and Rügen's Isle ?
0, no!-0, no!-by such a line
Fatherland is drawn much too fine.
What is the German Fatherland ?
Where there's a Journal to be scanned,
Where there's a Cabinet to snub,
A sore to chafe, a raw to rub ?
O, yes !-0, yes 1-that's BISMARCK's line-
His Fatherland is yours and mine.
That is the German Fatherland,
That dares by prisoned bishops stand.
Dares fellowship in faith avow,
With those who to Falk-laws must bow.
O, yes !-0, yes !-give BISMARCK line,
His Vaterland is yours and mine.
That is the German Fatherland,
Where the Press knows no Censor's band;
Where thought 's ungagged, and comment free,
Though BISMARCK's rule its subject be.
O, yes !-0, yes !- that's BISMARCK's line-
“What's mine's my own—what's yours is mine."
What is the German Fatherland ?
Where all's not right that might has planned,
Where civil life, from service free,
Off-caps not to authority-
O, yes 1-0, yes !-give BISMARCK line,
His Fatherland swamps yours and mine.
No doubt the world were Fatherland.
Its own good could it understand :
Glad under Faust-recht to lie down,
And bow to Blood and Iron's crown-
O, yes !-0, yes !-when that's my line,
Then BISMARCK's Fatherland is mine!
What is the German Fatherland ?
Where Echt Deutsch are both heart and hand ?
Where cabbage doth for Sauer Kraut grow,
And Rheinwein ranks above Bordeaux ?
0, no!-0, no !-by such a line,
Fatherland, now, is squeezed too fine !
What is the German Fatherland ?
Where rule is rather bluff than bland,
Where backs to Jacks-in-office curve,
Where in the ranks all men must serve?
0, no!-0, no!-by such a line
Fatherland would be drawn too fine.
What is the German Fatherland ?
Is 't where Church stoops to State command,
Where Priests must pray as Prince requires,
And School but teach as State desires ?
0, no!-0, no!-by such a line
Fatherland's bounds are drawn too fine.
THE VERY TERM FOR IT.

O, YE PROSSERS, prophets of evil days,
That the price of the Native will thus on us raise !
Those beautiful bivalves which, witched if unwilling,
We swallow already at four for a shilling,
Do you wish to deaden their delicate zest,
And plant despair in the epicure's breast?
May DANDO's death his disciples release,
Ere British Natives are Sixpence apiece!
O what the deuce are those dredges at,
Coarse rakes in Native settlements stuck,
Disturbing their slumbers and spoiling their “spat,"
And amongst the mild molluscs running a muck?
'Tis an epidemic of sheer stupidity,
A chronic seizure of crass cupidity,
A purblind passion, that chastisement begs,
For killing the goose with the golden eggs!

GOVERNOR PINE, in re LANGALIBALÈLE, and that in
the teeth of Colonial feeling and opinion, he acted
under coercion of his very best judgment. If Punch
had felt any doubt about it, the sifting of the matter
to-night, in the Lords, would have satisfied him. If
this is the best case two such advocates as LORD GREY
and LORD KIMBERLEY can make, LORD CARNARVON'S
is a better.
(Commons.) Lewis is rapidly becoming a name of
fear. All the questioning capacity of MR. DARBY
GRIFFITH seems to have become concentrated in the
Clan Lewis. What is there MR. C. LEWIS does not mean to call
attention to-and does not wish to know? And now to-night
0., treading on the heels of C. of that ilk, proceeded to ask
MR. DISRAELI whether Prussia had not addressed a “menacing”
despatch to Belgium, and what steps England would take to main-
tain Belgian neutrality and independence, if endangered.
MR. DISRAELI, in reply, expatiated on the superfluity of
epithets. The German note was one not of menace, but of
remonstrance—“ friendly remonstrance” was a familiar phrase
- so let us say " friendly" note, not "menacing." (By the way,
isn't “friendly" an epithet, too?) “ When the neutrality of
Belgium is threatened, Her Majesty's Government will do their duty to their Sovereign, and not be afraid to meet Parliament.”
A personal duello between SIR L. PALK and Sik H. JAMES. SIR H. has held briefs in matters rising out of the Paraguayan Loan.
Sir L. PALK had asked a question on the subject, conveying, as far as we can understand it, the imputation that SIR H. JAMES was trying to
get out, through the Select Committee information which the Court has refused to help him to. It is inferred that SIR L. PALK's question
is prompted by the financiers chiefly implicated in the Honduras Loan. People will put “this” and “that” together.
Substantial progress made in Committee on Artisans' Dwellings Bill. 'MR. FAWCETT, still in the sulks with the Bill, complains of
the want of machinery to compel Local Authorities to build up after they have pulled down. MR. CROSS believes in Local Authorities.
When Home Secretaries do take to believing, their faith is wonderful. SIR SYDNEY WATERLOW know more about Improvement of
Dwellings than MR. Cross, or anybody in the House, indeed, and he thinks it would be well to give the Confirming Authority power to
compel the Local. MR. CROSS put his foot down for his clauses, and neither MR. FAWCETT nor SIR SYDNEY took anything by their Motions.
Tuesday (Lords).-Justices' of the Peace qualification will have to go like other qualifications. LORD ALBEMARLE's Bill takes the
first step to its abolition.
(Commons.) MR. C. LEWIS moved that the Times and Daily Ners have been guilty of a breach of privilege in reporting a letter
from MR. HERRAN (Honduras Minister at Paris) to the Chairman of the Foreign Loans Committee, read before the Committee but
not reported to the House. MR. LEWIS explained that he took this step because this letter contained a libel on a Member of Parliament.
MR. HERRAN's letter was read by the Clerk. Then followed a curious scene. It seemed, for a while, as if MR. LEWIS could find
no backer. But a backer was at last found – BIGGAR could hardly have been desired. Then MR. TORRENS tried to draw MA.
Lowe, and MR. LOWE would not be drawn. Then there was a fight between Ayes and Noes, and Noes all but had it; but
BIGGAR stood in the breach for the Ayes, and ere the three-minute-glass ran out, the Ayes rallied, and “had it" over the Noes.
Then came MR. C. LEWIS's Rider, "That the printers of the Times and Daily News be brought before the bar of the House."
This was more serious. Nobody had the presence of mind to move the previous question.
MR. DISRAELI repeated MR. TORRENS's attempt to draw MR. LOWE—with the same lack of success. The MARQUIS OF HABTINGTON
declared MR. Lowe would not be drawn.
Why, asked MR. WATKIN WILLIAMS, try to cripple the Foreign Loans Committee from behind the Times and Daily News ?
Then SiR W. HARCOURT dashed into the mêlée" a big rough stone"- the ugly word " lobbying." Thereupon followed confusion
worse-confounded. In spite of MR. BRIGHT's warning of the absurd position the House would put itself in, by calling its own organs of
publicity to its bar on a charge of having used the speaking-trumpets supplied them by the House's own hand, MR. DISRAELI was ill-
advised enough to vote with MR. LEWIS, and the citation of the Times to the bar of the House was voted by 204 to 153, of the Daily News

MUSICAL REVIVALISM.
Good MR. PUNCH,
I HEAR that one of MR. SANKEY's hymns is now
being whistled in the streets, which I take it is the
height of musical popularity. Perhaps it may be through
his influence that a street-organ while I write is actually
performing the “Hallelujah Chorus !” Fact, Sir, on
my honour! Within my hearing at this minute (which
is, to speak minutely, the twenty-second past the hour
of four on Friday afternoon), the grandest work of
HANDEL is being played, in a small way, by the turning
of a handle! Am I to give my thanks to MESSRS.
M. & S. for this amazing treat? As instruments in
their good cause, are the Revivalists beginning to con-
vert the barrel-organs ? Is Christy, about to be super-
seded by Christian, Minstrelsy?

ANY persons may
attempt to imagine,
but few, we believe,
are correctly in-

ordinary precautions
that will be taken to
prevent the intrusion
of any unauthorised
person into the Albert
Hall on the day of
the Installation of
His Royal Highness
the Grand Master.
Each Mason, as he
arrives, after being
blindfolded and shod
with carpet slippers,
will be required to
produce his certifi-
cate of baptism,
calling card, photo-
graph, and handker-
chief marked with
his name in full,
together with a
specimen of his ordi-
nary handwriting
and signature,-ali
countersigned by his
Lodge, and duly attested by
two Justices of the Peace for
the town or county in which
he habitually resides. He will
then be adjured to bare his
right arm, to prove that it is
branded with the letters which
denote his rank in the Craft;
and having passed this ordeal,
and shown that his name is
written inside his hat, his
claim to be present at the
ceremony will be put to no
further test.
Any attempt at imposture
will be instantly punished by
the removal of the offender
from the inside of the Hall to
the outside of the roof, where
he will be left with a bottle of
Apollinaris Water and all the best works on Masonry, but
without food, firing, or the means of smoking, until the
conclusion of the ceremony. Should he prove refractory,
CARDINAL MANNING will be sent for. When the Installa-
tion is over, the erring man will be tried and sentenced by a
tribunal composed exclusively of G.A.'s (Grand Aprons) and
P.G.A.'s (Past Grand Aprons), but their finding will not be
made known until the National Gallery has been rebuilt.
When all the brethren are assembled, the doors will be
locked, barred, bolted, and hermetically sealed, the keyholes
carefully plugged, and two Master Masons posted as warders
at each entrance, armed with drawn swords and loaded
revolvers, and carrying fog-signals in their pockets, to be
exploded in the event of any attempt being made to inter-
rupt the proceedings in the arena.
Previous to the Installation, a party of the brethren,
carrying safety lanterns and alarums, will thoroughly search
every nook and corner of the Hall, including the cellars, the
velarium, the ventilators, the roof, and the pipes and
bellows of the great organ; and will look under the seat of
each chair and behind the curtains of all the private boxes,
to satisfy themselves that no person is in the building
except those who have a right to be present.
Strange rumours are current as to the enormous sums which
Ladies have expressed their willingness to bestow on Masonic
charities, if they might only be permitted to view the pro-
ceedings from an aperture in the roof of the Hall. For further information respecting Freemasonry, its signs and secrets, its insignia
and rites, and its excellent dinners, consult the works of SANCHONIATHON (the cheap edition), TRISMEGISTUS THAUMATURGUS (the reprint
in a popular form), RHADAMANTHUS, HERMESIANAX, or PYTHAGORAS, and go early to the British Museum, as these authors are, at this
momentous crisis in the history of the Craft, in great request.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
OREIGN affairs occupied the Lords
(Monday, April 19th). LORD
STRATHEDEN wanted to teach
Austria how to make her com-
mercial treaties, and was politely
snubbed, from both sides the House,
by LORD DERBY and LORD GRAN
VİLLE. LORD RUSSELL called
attention to the late passage of
letters between BISMARCK and
Belgium. Laudari a laudato is an
ancient felicity. To be lectured on
letter-writing by a letter-writer is an honour hardly so
likely to be prized, at least by PRINCE BISMARCK.
The Complete Letter-Writer of a past generation
hoped Germany had not been asking Belgium to
curtail the liberty of the Press. LORD DERBY hoped
not. (PRINCE BISMARCK's first note had been happily
described by MR. DISRAELI AS “ friendly.” So, he had
been assured by the German Ambassador, was the
second.) Two negatives may be equivalent to an affir-
mative, but can two kisses make a kick ? LORD DERBY
thinks not. So Punch would like to think. But some
kisses are so like kicks.
LORD LAUDERDALE wants playing at soldiers at
publio and national schools to be turned into soldier-
ing in earnest, in hopes the boy's drill may be father
of the man's. DARWIN says the progress of the race is
in the other direction- from man-drill (anthropoid)
to man-not from boy-drill to man-drill.
The Commons took a series of what MR. COOK calls “ personally
conducted" excursions into regions the House has lately been
travelling too much into under the experienced conduot of Me
KENEALY.

art of self-defence lately-not a bad preparation for a "mill," but
which quite explained his delay in fixing the fight to whish the
gallant Captain had challenged him.
DR. KENEALY asked for a Government night for his " postponed ”
motion on the Tichborne Trial. MR. DrSRAELI said it hadn't been
"postponed,” for it had never been brought on. (Mr. Punch begs MR. Dis-
RAELI'S pardon. What is " postponed " but put off ; and what has the Doctor
been doing but “putting off” his Motion ever since he put on the M.P.?)
Besides, how could he offer facilities for a Motion that was still a mystery,
DR. KENEALY said it was no mystery; and after being pulled up incidentally by the SPEAKER-whom the Member for Stoke showed
himself quite disposed to argue with-explained that he intended to make certain complaints about the conduot of the trial-that was
parliamentary English and in reference to certain incidents of the trial which have occurred subsequent thereto-wasn't that Parlia-
mentary English (Englishman's English, at least) ?--and then to conclude with a Resolution for a Select Committee or Royal Com-
mission, whichever the House would give him,
“Then I'll try to get LORD ELCRO to give you to-morrow-Bis dat qui cito dat," said MB. DISRAELI,
"Really, that's too short notice-even for DR. KENEALY,” remonstrated MR. BRIGHT.
MR. RUSSELL GURNEY suggested Friday-better day, better deed.
DR. KENEALY said he was suffering from bronchitis. He would prefer that day week.
MR. DISRAELI said he had led the House under bronchitis all last Session, and knew what it was. However, he would give the
Doctor Friday. And so it was settled.
Then MR. WHALLEY had a round with MR. BAILLIE COCHRANE. “Had he not declined to present a Tichborne petition ?” “Yes,"
MR. BAILLIE COCHRANE admitted he had, by advice of the SPEAKER.
MR. BULWER read an allegation ascribed to the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE by MR. WHALLEY, and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE's contra-
| diction thereof as “destitute of the slightest shadow of foundation." MR. WHALLEY didn't feel clear that that was a reason for with-
drawing his statement.
What are “shadows of foundations" to MR. WHALLEY? There may be less things than “shadows," yet quite enough for MR. WHÄLLEY
to base a statement upon. He had made his statement on what he had seen in the papers-corroborated by the Honourable Member
for Stoke: assurance doubly sure. But he would see what he could do in the way of retractation.
MR. Lowe explained how the ridiculus mus of SENOR HERRAN's letter had crept out of the mountain of the Foreign Loans Committee
into the columns of the Times and Daily News. "
Then, returning at last, from its "personally conducted" evening's excursions, the House got the Artisans' Dwellings Bill through
Committee, and DR, PLAYFAIR dissected the Publio Health Bill, which might be a consolidation of imperfect laws, but not-pace
MR. SCLATER BOOTH-a final measure. But on the general approval of MESSRS. RATHBONE, STANSFELD, S. STANHOPE, DR. Lush, and
COLONEL BARTELOTT, (" 'Tis not as deep as a well, or as wide as a Church-door, but 'twill serve”) the Bill was read a Second Time.
In Committee on the Adulteration Bill, Dr. CAMERON did a good stroke of business by striking out the “knowingly," which made
convictions for adulteration practically impossible.
Thanks to the Dootor, a seller of adulterated articles is not to go soot-free till you can prove he knew there was sand in the sugar,
water in the milk, and lime or worse-in the saok.
Tuesday (Lords).-LORD MALMESBURY explained that, by eliminating two stout Assistant-Paymasters, they had found room for two
thin Chaplains, in the Arctic ships.
(Commons.)-MR. C. LEWIS wanted to know -(what a boy that is for curiosity !)—what MR. DISRAELI was going to do, now he had
got out all about the Foreign Loans Committee's " Ridiculus mus" ?
MR. DISRAELI said he wasn't going to do anything. Isn't that the rule of the Session ?
Dk. KENEILY, in answer to Simon CATECA[STES, said he had a list of naughty Mombers who declined to present. Tichborne

Finally, after COLONEL MURE's Jeremiad, MR. HARDI
replied frankly and sensibly, showing up the doctors'
differences, and professing his determination to give the
fairest trial to LORD CARDWELL's plans.
LORD HARTINGTON thanked him, and as in Leader's
duty bound, said there couldn't be much wrong in LORD
CARDWELL's reforms, if the holes hadn't been found out
before this. The truth was, the weakness was not in the
new patches, but the old garment. He thought, on the
whole, recruiting was getting rather better. (Let us hope
it has reached the point of "worstness" at which mend-

Wednesday.-A triumph of Common Sense and Chris-
tian Charity over Intolerance and Bigotry. MR.
OSBORNE MORGAN's Bill for allowing Dissenters to hold
their own services over their dead, in parish church-
yards, was only defeated by 14 in a full House-248 to
234, after an excellent débate, of which the honours
were worthily borne away by MR. GLADSTONE and MR.
BRIGHT-par nobile fratrum-in such a cause. MR.
BRIGHT, especially, spoke with more than a flash-with
a sustained glow-of the old brightness. It seemed as
if a good and great cause—the cause of Christian charity
against Christian intolerance-had given him back the
old life and the old fire.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HOW TO IMPORT CATTLE.
TAKE two hundred cattle, say at Antwerp,
and stow them on board a packet-boat, on
deck and in the hold, as closely as possible,
like herrings in a cask. Tie their heads so
tightly to the ship's side that they shall be
unable to move. Let them remain in this
position during the twenty-four hours
occupied by the passage between Antwerp
and London. Keep them all this time with-
out either water or food-at any rate with-
out water. Even in calm weather these
arrangements will answer very well, but
the sea being rough will render them
thoroughly effectual.
When the beasts arrive at the Foreign
Cattle Market, Deptford, lose no time in
getting them out of the ship, without re-

ANOTHER relic from the great Bronze Age !
Lethal this time in lieu of culinary;
Fierce warfare doubtless did its wielder wage
'Neath VUL-NIRARI.
If Man's first worldly lesson was to feed,
To fight must certainly have been his second.
Some rude device to make a brother bleed
Is rightly reckoned
Among his first inventions. Every land
Hives in its dust-heaps proof more plain than print
How soon man armed his homicidal hand
With shard or flint,
But here's a choice antique which clearly shows
That when this dainty death-dealer was dated,
The art of neatly slaughtering one's foes
Was cultivated.
Since this most ancient bit of bronze was new
Three thousand years have passed-s0 SMITH explaineth-
The men it served are dead as those it slew,
The sword remaineth.

Say will such posthumous glory wait for ever
On KRUPP and BISMARCK ?
When thrice ten centuries again have flown

Will War and “ Woolwich Infants" then be known
As themes for song?
Or if some ninetieth century SMITH should light on

Amidst the dust of,-Dorking, say, or Brighton,-
And strive to settle
Its date and purpose, will the world around
Be then Arcadian, or still a garrison ?
And will contemporary blades abound
To court comparison ?
Alas! this sword that has survived so much
Has not outlived its function; much sad history
May yet be written ere another such

Still lives, nay, gathers ghastlier glories round it,
Though ages part the smith, who forged this blade,
From SMITH, who found it.

BESIDES the other Channel Islands there is a St. George's Channel
Island possessing a domestio Legislature-the Isle of Man, which

The Home-Rulers demand also a distinct Parliament. Thus, in

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

UNLEY SA
URE as “listeners seldom hear good of themselves," "meddlers
rarely mend matters.” LORD RUSSELL (Lords, Monday, May 3)
ought to have had that truth well drummed into him by his old
experience of muddles due to meddling. His Lordship, however,
not satisfied with his share of meddles and muddles, like Oliver
Twist is asking for more, in the shape of “ papers calculated to
throw light on the recent relations of the German and Belgian
Governments," LORD DERBY thinks such publication would be
more conducive to beat than light, and prefers to wait till the
Belgian Chambers have discussed the papers in question. Rus-
SELLS will rush, where DERBYS fear to tread. Between BISMARCK
and Belgium it is a very pretty quarrel as it stands, and the inter-
ference of England might, in LORD DERBY's opinion, make it an
ugly one. While man and wife are fighting, or-the diplomatic
equivalent for that domestic situation, while Foreign Ministers
are exchanging "friendly" notes, it is time enough to intervene
when you can't help it.
(Commons.)– The CHANCELLOR OF THE Ex-
CHEQUER, in answer to SIR CHARLES RUSSELL,
said, he had heard "it was easier to get florins
than shillings.” Will SiR STAFFORD be good
enough to tell Mr. Punch (in strict confi-
dence) where?
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER de-
clares that £42,000 worth of shillings is lying
at the Bank, and as much more at the Mint,
ready to be squeezed into circulation by
"proper pressure." Unfortunately, in Mr.
Punch's experience, shillings want a very
great deal of pressing.

that examinations for Naval Cadetships were
no longer competitive. That is, at least, one

department rescued from the Heathen Chinee.
Mr. Punch is glad to hear from LORD H.
LENNOX—that active and intelligent ædile-
whose "answering" in the House Mr. Punch
is bound to report as “most creditable"—that QUEEN ANFE's statue in Her Majesty's Square (behind the Westminster back-
slums), is as well as can be expected under the “cock-shying " ciroumstances of the neighbourhood. The Westminster roughlings
have only knocked off two of Her Majesty's fingers, and a bit of her sceptre. What Queen in that region could expect to fare better?
LORD HENRY has assigned a policeman for the special protection of Her Majesty during the hours the young Westminster ideas are
learning to shoot, out of school. That Policeman will, at least, have the proud privilege of feeling himself more useful than the sentries
at Buckingham Palace.
.. Peace Preservation again. The usual talk, tall and small; the usual dividing, and the usual little or no progress to report. Once,
thanks to a “happy thought" and snap division of CAPTAIN NOLAN's (on Amendment to insert 1877, as the limit of the Act's continuance),
the Government only escaped defeat by two!
The debate included a long incidental chat about Freemasonry, in compliment, we presume, to the PRINCE OF WALES.
The Irish Members kept the House at it till one, when it broke up with the pleasant prospect of meeting again for Peace Preserva-
tion at two to-morrow. Preserving your peace is one thing ; holding it is another.
Tuesday (Lords).- LORD SELBORNE brought in two Bills, one for better Regulating the Inns of Court, the other for establishing a
School of Law, “where all might receive instruction." While Benchers and Barristers are satisfied with the existing government
of the Ipng of Court, those Inns are not very likely to see a change of hosts or bills, rooms or perquisites, larders or cellars. As for a
“Law School for all," Punch hardly knows whether to shake in his shoes or to sing for joy at the prospect of such a happy family of
kites, crows, and pigeons. Think of Solicitors, Barristers, and Clients in the bud all sucking-in that perfection of reason called
Law, on the same benches and from the same fountain-heads!' Who can say what developments might follow ? Perhaps kites, pigeon-
livered and lacking gall-like Hamlet—or pigeons with kites' claws and beaks! But this is likely to remain matter of speculation, for
all the prospect LORD SELBORNE's Bill has of becoming law.
(Commons.)- At two, Peace-Preservation again. The last Clause left was fought over tooth and nail, and the Committee was
adjourned, clausu infecto.
At the evening sitting, after MR. BOURKE had dealt with MB. O'CLERY-who so cleared the House as just to escape a count
on his Motion to recognise the belligerent rights of the Carlists- LORD HARTINGTON brought on his plan for exempting reports from
liability at Law, and giving a majority, instead of a Member, of the House power to put out the light of the Press in Parliament.
MR. MITCHELL-HENRY objected, complaining of abbreviated reports, and proposing a Select Committee to consider of a scheme of
official reporting, to which he thought some of the papers would subscribe. Mr. Punch, for one paper, declines to subscribe to any
plan that will make reports longer than they are. To adopt MR. DISRAELI'S “happy thought," he objects to the gallery being

Where a young giant, full of health,
Sprung from the loins of England, grows
To greatness in a calm repose;
Where wealth that comes from crowded mart
Is spent on Letters and on Art;
Where Englishmen work well together
Under divine Italian weather;
Worthy you are to bear the name
Of the great Queen whose dearest aim
Is peace to all beneath her sway-
VICTORIA !
Australian waters shall not feel
The cleavage of a hostile keel,
Nor foeman's flag from Europe toss
Beneath the silver Southern Cross :

And all men learn the Arts of Peace;
There poets of a newer type
Shall greet us, when the Age is ripe,
And Melbourne, strong and youthful town,
Shall share Athena's Violet Crown,
Ere many decades pass away-
VICTORIA !
Shame to the dullards who desire
To quench our colonising fire,
To keep the imperial instinct down,
And make a fool's cap of the Crown.
It shall not be: while ocean rolls,
And Englishmen haye gallant souls,
And court the strong heroic hour,
While Freedom is a word of power,
While great colonial nations rise

Everybody here is more or less interested in the proceedings,
which are, just this moment, apparently at a standstill, arising, it
might well be, to judge from the tranquillity about me, from the
Auctioneer's having dropped off to sleep. I have time to look round.
I should say I am the only accidental visitor present. I wonder if
there are many who know less about china than I do. Perhaps.
If so, those are the real Chinamaniacs.
The attitude of most here, and the impossibility at first of ascer-
taining exactly what is going on, suggests the notion of a mixed
crowd listening to an interesting case in a respectable police-court.
I have, as it were, evidently entered during the anxious pause
which intervenes between a crucial question put by the defendant's
counsel, and the reply of the adverse witness. Everybody is hold-
ing in, and we are all going to breathe again presently. The state
of the case is, that, there has been a bid, and there is now a pause.
A plate, or a bowl, is under examination.
The Auctioneer, in a witness-box, at one end of the room, keeps
up the notion of a trial. He seems to be an unwilling witness
giving his evidence with an air of melancholy regret, which is
simply touching. He is, so it appears to me, looking round the
room with a despairing glance, as though trying to discover in the
crowd some friendly spirit who will understand his sad position,
aud to whom he can say (with those pitiful eyes, and not aloud, of
course), "Look here! here I am! they've stuck me up here! I
can't help it! I can't get out! I must speak! it's a painful, most
painful position !”.
Then he seems to address the public in general, in a reproachful
way (but always with his eyes, of course, and never aloud), "I say,
you come here, and take up my time. You don't help me in the
least. It's no use talking to you. Do get on! Now, please, for
my sake, du get on!"
I have not the slightest doubt that many a sympathetic soul is
Jed into bidding by the plaintive but silent appeals of that apparent
victim in the Auctioneer's witness-box. I am very nearly crying
out, half sobbing too, I am so affected, “Here! What do you want?
I'll bid. How much? Anything to help you and the little ones
at home, only don't, please, look like that! How much? O, how
much ?"
But I restrain myself with the consciousness of having in my
pocket only a doubtful cab-fare to the place where I am going to
dine.

“PSYCHO” SURPASSED.
"A CLERGYMAN" in the Medium and Daybreak,
hailing from Edinburgh, relates wonders exhibited there
by a DR. MONCK at a séance in which that gentleman
“was suddenly lifted up by some invisible power on the
shoulders of some of the company.” The witness of this,
among other unusual occurrences, premises his report by
the statement that:
"After waiting a long time we were rewarded with numerous
raps of at least four or five distinct sorts.”
Was one sort the sort of raps that can be given by
a good cane over the knuckles? If so, perhaps the
"Clergyman and his companions were rewarded as they
deserved.
Another writer, who signs his name and address,
mentions amongst the “facts” which occurred at DR.
MONCK's séances : -
“Tests, elongations of the body on one occasion, as observed
by MR. SIMPSON and MRS. J. BOWMAN, who had hold of the
medium's hands; the medium was drawn out to the enormous
height of ten feet, nearly from floor to ceiling."
Credible witnesses have related the same incredible
phenomena of MR. HOME. Can MASKELYNE AND COOKE
produce the like---and what if they can? Will they
indeed have struck" a death-blow to Spiritualism" by
imitating sights which can never have occurred, except
in the imaginations of some who say they saw them ?
However, if DR. MONCK was really elongated to the
extent of ten feet, he should be employed by the Police
to carry apoplectic or drunk and incapable persons to
the station-house. He is evidently a first-rate stretcher.
Perhaps, however, that expression may be deemed more
truly applicable to the witness of his alleged elongation.

DERBY-DAY DISCIPLINE.
“Really I must consider this subject.”—MR. DISRAELI in
reply to SIR WILFRID Lawson's question if he meant to adjourn
over the Derby-Day.
IN night-, by way of considering-cap,
Small blame to BEN if he took his nap,
While BIGGAR maunders, and WHALLEY Weeps,
And dulness through St. Stephen's creeps-
He dreams: SIR WILFRID, airy pate,
With Adam's ale inebriate,
Wakes up the PREMIER ; wants to know
If to the Derby he may go.
BEN, after answer à la Sphinx,
Resettles to his forty winks.
Dreameth he of the stand, the hill,
Bookmen and backers bawling shrill;
The wild sweep-past of racing steeds,
And ladies of still faster breeds ;
The bold dog that will cross the course,
Defying Starling and the Force,
And tears defiant down the ride,
'Mid hoots and howls from either side ?
Meanwhile SIR WILFRID all would rules
By rod of the Good Templars' School,
And, laughing, shuts us from the pale
Which men will climb for cakes and ale.
"No Derby!” Let that field lie fallow:
A fig for favourite Camballo!
For wise men matters there a pin
Betwixt a screw and Gallop-in
This is Good Templardom's stern sentence,
*As medicine to help repentance,
Drink, Wednesday next, to purge your faults,
Not Epsom fizz, but Epsom salts.
For a siphonia mount hair-shirt,
Not 'gainst road-dust, but moral dirt;
Upon white tile no green veil pin,
But tear off that which screens your sin;
O'er your book rather blush than brag,
And mount not, but put on, the drag!"
That for Good Templars! Mr. Punch,
Wooed on all hands to laugh and lunch,
Will humours of the road enjoy,
Nor with excess enjoyment cloy;
Will rise to transient may-fly loves,
Lose, matters not how much, in gloves;
From bright eyes sparkling madness drain,
More swift and sweet than dry champagne,
Feel racing rapture, breathe fresh air,
And gladly meet SIR WILFRID there.

The Odd Persons (in the City) who represent themselves as simple

The Odd Persons (in the Country) who, in spite of recent dis-

The Odd Persons (in Trade) who object to the Adulteration Laws,
and yet wish to keep their customers from visiting the Co-operative

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

ům
Eure et
IFTY Members showed after the Whitsuntide
week-(Thursday, May 20)—"a beggarly ac-
count of empty benches.” The rest were not going
to cut short their holidays for MR. SULLIVAN'S
question, or LORD ELCHO's perpetual motion, that
the Service is going to that place which is paved
with good intentions.
Punch would not be surprised if a good many of
the dear naughty boys stretched their Whitsun
holidays over the Derby-day. À propos, suppose,
instead of PETER TAYLOR's regular Anti-Derby-
Day Jeremiad, SIR WILFRID, as Commons Professor
of “the Gay Science,” were to treat Honourable Members to a parody on " Black Eyed Susan," “All on the Downs the House was
poured.” Of course Ministers will be there on their Drag-if it has not been too much used up in the course of the Session. We
never remember the Drag so much in demand through the four months before Whitsuntide. .
Business opened with MR. SULLIVAN's question about Count MONSTER's speech at the National Club, for which the Count
certainly deserves a rap over the knuckles. (By the way, considering his high-flying Protestantism, suppose the Count changed his name
from Count MUNSTER to Count ULSTER?) Will the Count forgive Mr. Punch for the suggestion that his advice to England - à propos
of the struggle between Protestantism and Ultramontanism—“to look out in time," and "to keep an eye on Ireland," is altogether
superfluous, and tant soit peu impertinent ? Punch is quite aware the latter word is not diplomatic, but neither was COUNT MUNSTER'S
speech, as MR. DISRAELI was bound to admit in answer to MR. SULLIVAN's question.
Suppose LORD ODO RUSSELL had tendered a similar piece of advice at the dinner of some Protestant Club at Berlin ? Suppose
even Punch-non-diplomatic as he is-turned the tables, and recommended Germany, through COUNT MUNSTER, to look out in time,
and take care that between Eagle's claws and Falk laws she do not come to grief one of these days ?
MB. DISRAELI answered ÁR. SULLIVAN very discreetly. “ COUNT MUNSTER's speech, he should say, was not diplomatic; but he
had no wish to discourage free speech, even from a diplomatist. It is possible His Excellency may soon visit Ireland, and then he
will see there is not the slightest analogy between the Roman Catholio subjects of the German Emperor, and the Roman Catholic subjects
of Her Majesty the Queen."
Not the slightest. Our laws give our Roman Catholio fellow-bubjects—Ultramontanes or others—full swing and free speech. The
Falk laws give them repression, fine, and imprisonment. We leave the safety-valve free to work. Germany, or rather BISMARCK, not
only ties it down, but sits upon it into the bargain, and the Reich's-Kanzler is not a feather-weight. On the whole, England believes
her own system the safer of the two, and, through Mr. Punch, recommends Count MUNSTER to look at home, and keep his breath to cool
his (Prussian) porridge.
Another night of active ELCHO eruption-the Charteris Geyser in full military blast. Nothing and nobody can persuade LORD ELCHO
that our Army is not rotten-stock, lock, and barrel. Most of the old Army-men in the House, and a great many out of it, disgusted
with recent changes-above all, with the Abolition of Purchase, and the introduction of a Short Service System-and indisposed to give
these and their concomitant alterations a fair time for trial-are as busy as a certain gentleman in a gale of wind, picking holes in our
present Army arrangements. All the military malecontents find a ready mouthpiece in LORD ELCHO.
The best proof of the utter want of practical usefulness in these Army-nights is the absolute irreconcileability of the suggestions for
improvement with which they teem. If ever too many cooks spoiled the broth, there can be but small hope for our military pot-au-feu.
Look at the range of recipes. LORD ELCHO, pending a conscription, which he believes we must come to, wants none but effective men-that
is, in his sense of the word, men over twenty-entered on the Estimates of Effectives. He laughs to scorn the DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE'S
assertion that “if the present Aldershot Division were put on a war-footing he would be ready to march with them anywhere, or on
any service, at five minutes' notice.” He prefers the authority of "the man in the street” to that of the Commander-in-Chief.
SIR G. BALFOUR thought the estimate of men and horses to an artillery battery excessive. Good service had been done with half
the regulation numbers. As to recruiting, he was dead in the teeth of LORD ELCHO's plan of conscription.
MR. SIDEBOTTOM was all for raising the soldier's pay.
MR. HOLMS was all for Short Service and Reserves.
COLONEL LOYD LINDSAY was all for training Boys for the Army, as we do for the Navy.
GENERAL SAUTE was satisfied that Short Service must fail. Deferred pay and pensions, with Civil employment in prospective, was
the salt for the recruit's tail. Your Home service should be compulsory, your Foreign service Volunteer.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
glu
» Е САМъс
PARLIAMENTARY week with two
Derby Days in it-the Mon-
day, on which the House
heard the announcement of a
communication from LORD
DERBY to PRINCE BISMARCK
“ of a nature to correct mis-
conception and to ensure
peace," and the Wednesday,
for which it adjourned in
defiance of SIR WILFRID. So
we see Roman prodigies repeat
themselves. Bos locutus est !
JOHN BULL has spoken. And
more-80 the Head of Her
Majesty's Government in-
forms the Head of Her
Majesty's Opposition - has
“received a satisfactory reply." Fact! The British
Lion, it seems, might have figured in Mr. P's

Russian Bear, to that “genteelest of tunes,” “O,

Bos Britannicus-whatever be the brute-form in which

-has at last found a tongue, in a grave European
crisis, be an augury that, if need be, he could find
teeth and claws as well. Without them tongue is
apt to be treated with the contempt that edges the
old saw, “ Vox et præterea nihil."
- Talk of the Elephant's trunk that can rend an oak,
or 'pick up a pin; or the Nasmyth steam-hammer,
that can weld a hundred-ton crank, or crack a nuti
- What are these to the British Parliament ? On the same
night that it disposes of a dispatch on which may hang
European peace or war, behold it seriously busy about the
cutting of GEORGE WINTERBOURNE's hair, in Oxford Castle!
Other matters as minute were, on that same Monday night,
the subject of Members' questions and Ministers' answers. So
true is it that your Legislator, unlike your Lex, “de minimis
curat."
DR. PLAYFAIR, very sensibly, withdraws his Vivisection Bill, on the Government announcing the issue of a Royal Commission to
inquire into the subject. The matter is of importance enough, both in the interests of humanity and science. The popular excitement
on the subject, based as it is on humane feeling, and roused by some abuse of a useful practice, threatens to be mischievous, and
demands the guidance of cool inquiry. Most of the night was taken up by a tourney between the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and
Punch's good friend, PROFESSOR FAWCETT, on the subject of Local Taxation, à propos of the Second Reading of the Public Works
Loan Acts Amendment Bill. Pace the Professor, the fray was at once a sham-fight and a fight in the dark. No doubt, Local
Government is chaotic. As little doubt that the Government which steps into that “mighty maze," will very soon find its clue ravelling
and tangling in its hand, while the hornets' nests it will have disturbed make progress in any direction all but impossible, Local
Government will be work enough and to spare for more than one Session, or many either, and will need a stronger hand than the one
now at the helm. It is an enterprise that would have taxed GLADSTONE in his grimmest “cutting down” form.
Tuesday, May 25.-SIR WILFRID on the Derby-in very good form, and very excellent fooling. If only our dear baronet would
settle, beforehand, with Mr. P. which of his good things are likely to be fired off with best effect from the benches of Parliament, and
which had better be reserved for the columns of Mr. P.! There is his suggestion of the SPEAKER going to the Derby in his State
Coach, with a body-guard of Members! What a capital Cartoon is here wasted! The House would have laughed as heartily at a far
worse joke.
It is thirty years, it seems, since the House first adjourned for the Derby. Surely that should be sufficient prescription of title.
BIR WILFRID quotes MR. GREVILLE as an authority for the blackguardism of the turf (Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes ?),
and the Saturday Review for “the filthy ruffianism" of suburban race meetings—whereof the Derby (he says) is the whole forty rolled
into one. Punch is not disposed to dispute the verdict of such excellent authorities ; but he would remind SIR WILFRID that the
Derby is as much a scene of innocent outing, free-handed fun, and family, if rather rampant, out-door amusement, as an occasion
of betting, book-making, or turf-blackguardism; and that what degrades it is not the stamp of “Cockney carnival and suburban
saturnalia” which SIR WILFRID selected for the climax of his peroration.
It is the old quarrel of cakes v. no cakes, and ale v. no ale; and if the “ ginger" is a little “hotter in the mouth” at Epsom on the
Derby Day than in other places, where cakes and ale are in the ascendent over the virtues, Mr. Punch sees no reason in that, why the
House should not take a holiday for our “Isthmian games," and see the “blue riband," which politicians know more of as the prize
of a good deal of political “crossing” and “milking," “ pulling " and "scratching," contended for among a four-legged field, and on
the Downs instead of the Commons. So the House thought when it voted a Derby whole holiday by 206 to 81.
And then, as if to make up for the morrow's play by the day's work, it knocked off some 200 clauses in Committee on the Public
Health Bill; and after this “breather," rattled through the rest of the paper at the same slapping pace till seven, resuming for Scotch
Education and SIR WILLIAM STIRLING MAXWELL at nine, and adjourning over the Derby Day at ten minutes to twelve! Hadn't the
House fairly earned its Holiday ?
Wednesday.-All the World and his Wife Derbied and Joaned.
Thursday.-"A night wi' NORTHCOTE.” The battle of the Savings-Banks, Old v. New, was fiercely fought by the financial
great guns on both sides, GLADSTONE and LOWE among them. Is Government right in taking the profits made out of the low interest
on the Post Office Savings Banks deposits to make up the deficit arising from the too high interest allowed in times past on deposits
of the old Savings-Banks?
SIR STAFFORD NORTHCOTE says it is only a question of account, and that the £118,000 surplus, from the one source, may fairly be
employed to make up the £107,000 deficit, from the other. “No," says MR. GLADSTONE, " that is the untradesmanlike falsehood of
the same concern;' and, in Lombard Street, would be considered 'insane banking.'” It seems clear enough that the system is not
defensible from a business point of view. All that can be said is that the Old Sayings-Bank interests are strong, and that as they

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHIMS ON A WEDNESDAY.
Lawson, 'tis true the Derby's now no more
What it once used to be in days of yore.
E'en then, and at its best a mixed resort
Of dissipation, roguery, and sport;
Thence, of late years, the sport has well-nigh flown,
The Vices have it almost all their own.
Yet still, such magic works in happy names,
Our Epsom Races are our Isthmian Games.
House or no House, the Leaders of Debate,
And all of every party in the State,
Save Wednesday's would-be lawmakers, would play
The truant ever on the Derby Day.
But all those Members of eccentric mind,
To whose conceits each Wednesday stands resig
They, all of them, would take the best of care,
The House for sitting open, to be there.
O, then what rampant Acts might not ensue!
What mischief Wednesday's wiseacres could do !
Enfranchise the fair sex behind our backs,
Enact Home-Rule; repeal the Income-tax.
An awful Bill might manage to get read,
Letting deceased wives' sisters widowers wed;
Then what restraints fanatics might impose
On British freedom goodness only knows!
Some odious Act, the birth of addled brains,
To stop, on Sunday, boats and railway trains,-
The bantling of a Sabbatarian ass, –
Might go into Committee, nay, might pass !
Or what if, in the absence of the wise,
Who keep on meddling pedants watchful eyes,
Fit representatives of Colney Hatch,
In a majority, should chance to snatch,
Unfairly, and against its Author's will,
A triumph for your own Permissive Bill ?

(From our Sensational Reporter.)
Arctic Regions, May 29, 1875.
An appalling tragedy in domestic life has lately scat-
tered consternation in the neighbourhood of Bayswater.
A newly-married couple, possessed of ample fortune,
and moving, it is rumoured, in extremely good society,
had been observed to live together upon very loving
terms, and no suspicion as to their affection was
entertained among their friends. It appears, however,
that on Monday morning last the young husband left
his wife in considerable agitation, having, as he alleged,
some business in the City. It has since transpired that
he had previously secured himself a stall at Drury Lane
for SALVINI in Othello ; and there seems reason to be-
lieve that the tragical event, which subsequently hap-
pened, was first suggested to his mind by this most
masterly performance. It was noticed by the Footman
that he did not return until a few minutes before his
usual dinner-hour, when, rushing in abruptly, without
one word of warning, he proceeded to the bed-chamber,
where his wife was in the act of dressing for the even-
ing, and, before her startled Maid could even scream for
help, he caught his wife up in his arms, in a frenzy of
excitement, and deliberately proceeded to smother her-
with kisses!

NO RETURN
At her feet the Frozen Ocean, round her head the Auroral Lights,
SOME Spirit-Rappers hold a dreary creed,
Much like Pythagorean transmigration,
Through cycles, chill and changeless, of six month-days and nights,
In her bride-veil, fringed with icicles, and of the snowdrift spun,
That is, that souls from bodies will be freel
Sits the White Ladye of the Pole, still waiting to be won.
Only to undergo “Re-incarnation.”.
That theory is all humbug, let us trust,
What suitors for her palace-gates have hoisted daring sail,
Who would not rather be resolved to dust ?
Though eye of man has never seen the face behind her veil!
Our sires may well have wished again to be
So long sighed for, so hard served for, as this Queen, was never none,
On England's soil, so fair a face that wore,
Since the days of brave adventure and true service first begun.
But to revive among Posterity
To her feet their Norse blood urging sent the Vikingur throng,
For us 'twere sadder than to be no more,
Byrnie on back and axe in fist, in their war-drakes swift and strong.
Unless our souls could be debased, to suit
There, bleaching on her threshold, lie the bones of ships and men,
Surroundings suitable to natures brute.
With Red Eric that sailed Vinlandwards, ne'er to steer south again.
All that endears life to the young in heart
But old in years, is withering day by day,
To her cold threshold galliots of the Zuyder-Zee made way,
Else were they still unwilling to depart;
With brave BARENTZ, sturdy suitor, that would not be said nay;
Now little reck how soon they pass away,
He set his heart to win her hand-but only saw, afar,
And, if they disbelieved it not, would dread
The glimmer of her wan white veil beneath the Polar Star.
Return to this changed country from the dead.
In the steps of those Dutch suitors, English Captains, blithe and bold,
How fast the smoky sweltering cities grow!
Since the spring-tide of good QUEEN Bess, faced fog and ice and cold;
The flowers, the fields, the woodlands disappear!
FROBISHER, GRENVILLE, Hudson, and BAFFIN, souls of steel,
How foul with factory filth, and fouler, flow
In quest of the Ice-Maiden urging North each pigmy keel.
The turbid rivers, once so crystal clear !
As the desert track is measured by the wrecked ships of the sand,
'Twill be a worse world still for the next race,
So bleaching bones of men and hulls from berg and hummock stand,
Gving the way it goes, and at the pace.
To tell where in some high, hot, heart the ice-wind's pumbing breath
O Conquering WILLIAM, and I thou Red King,
Chilled the wild blood coursing eager for that Bride of Snow and Death. Whose bones were lately shunted from their tomb,

In the snow-bound silver silence whose cold quells aught but soul,

The bravest still have sought her, and will seek, whoever fail.
The forest glades, and trees you loved so well.
There is no power their doings to undo,
If England's flag yet leads the quest, crowding sail close behind
And deal as you'd have dealt with those and them:
Our Western Brethren give their Stars and Stripes unto the wind;
Yet hope remains to check the sordid crew,
On the faint tracks of Red Erie, follow Norsemen of his kin;
And sylvan shades, yet spared, -which they condemn
And Saxons tough, for Fatherland new conquests keen to win.
To vile utilitarian ravage, -save,
On, on, to the weird ice-world, where, the winner's prize, sits she;
Whilst you at least rest quiet in the grave.
An untrod land about her feet, washed by an unsailed sea;
And what though FRANKLIN's, CROZIER's, steps have left their icy track,

not say, and F.-M. Punch has reminded
him of the omission in this week's Cartoon.
The Duke roundly committed himself to
the opinion that conscription is out of the
question in this country. “Patres Con-
scripti” in Parliament, if you please, but
“Filiz Conscripti” in the ranks, never !
Punch is bound to say “ditto" to the
Duke. If we can't get an Army by help of
the spurs of patriotism and bull-dog love of
fighting in the hour of need, and by the
attraction of pay, as a matter of business
in the piping and pipeclay times of peace,
we had better shut up the military shop
altogether, and confine ourselves strictly
to the other branches of shop-keeping, with
exclusive devotion to which we are, even
now, often charged. Bosh! JOHN BULL
has always kept a serviceable shooting-iron
(long-bow, match-lock, Brown Bess, En-
field, Snider, Martini-Henry, as the regula-
tion pattern might be) under the counter,
beside his yard-measure; and said shoot-
ing-iron would be as readily forthcoming
as ever, on good casus belli shown-Man-

teaching to the contrary notwithstanding.

and theological Great Lights-deeply hurt, as usual, at
this cruel attack, rose to order, and timidly fled to the
shelter of the SPEAKER from MR. HERSCHELL'S "dew-
drops.” But the SPEAKER held that MR. HERSCHELL'S
“aspersion” was quite in order; and the House voted
that no writ should be issued till the House has con-
sidered the evidence given before the Election Judges on
the Norwich petition.
(N.B.-It has since decided to issue, not the writ,
but a Commission of Inquiry!)
At the evening sitting, MR. WARD HUNT did not oppose
SIR JOHN HAY's Motion, alleging the Navy's dismay and
dissatisfaction with the present arrangements as to re-
tirement, “which neither secured efficiency, content-
ment, or due flow of promotion."
MR. CHILDERS defended the existing plan, his own in
the main.
MR. WARD HUNT rather leaned to SIR JOHN HAY.
MR. GOSCHEN suggested that everybody should agree
to make the best of what everybody admitted was a bad
bargain-an able and willing body of Officers too big for
the Service they have to supply. So Motion and Amend-
ment were withdrawn, and all the Naval Lords and
Naval reformers on both sides of the House kissed and
made friends; but, alas, Punch fears, are not going to
live happy ever after.”
Wednesday.-The House rejected, by 301 to 151, an
Irish Landlord and Tenant Act Amendment, described
(by the minority) as “a Bill with the simple object of
enabling a Tenant to obtain the real value of his hold-
ing;” by the majority, as "a Bill to confiscate the Land-
lord's property in favour of the Tenant.”
No doubt there are faults on both sides. Mr. Punch,
with the best will in the world to amend some at least
of the acts both of Irish Landlords (such as the exaction
of rack-rents and the eviction of solvent holders) and
Irish Tenants (such as breaking each others' heads, and
blowing out their Landlord's brains) feels quite unable

tice," or the "cruel measure of confiscation,” which it
appears from different sides, and so must be content to

M188 CARLOTTA ADDISON is as well fitted with a part in Georgiana
Vesey, as MR. COLETTE is ill-suited in that of her father. This clever
actor seemed to have misconceived the character: he was angular
instead of round; harsh and grating instead of smooth and
unctuous; too loud, fidgety and uneasy from first to last.
But the crown of the performance is in the two new impersona-
tions added to the cast-MRS. BANCROFT's Lady Franklin, and Miss
ELLEN TERRY's Clara Douglas. How irresistibly kindly, pleasant,
and winning the former was all through ; how slily humorous in the
scene in which she coaxes Graves into forgetting first his own
sorrows, and then his coloured bandanna, then into humming a
dance-tune, and lastly, into dancing a jig, should be seen, and
cannot be told.
How much could be done by sincerity, feeling, and fervour to give
a new breath of life to the high-flown and cold-drawn Clara, Punch
had never conceived till he saw ELLEN TERBY in the part. The
appeal to Evelyn's better nature in the Fifth Act was almost start-
ling, so strange seemed its ring of heartfelt sincerity in the balanced
rhythm of the author's artificial periods.
This young Actress has, in the two parts she has played here,
revealed an altogether new and unsuspected quality of poetic grace
and womanly feeling, which should justify all who look forward to
the prospects of higher Stage art in England in building the highest
hopes upon the future that lies before her.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ER BISMARCK BEATIFIED..
KING OSCAR, of Sweden, on a visit at
Berlin the other day, personally conferred
upon PRINCE BISMARCK the Order of the
Seraph. This is said to be “the highest
of all Swedish orders.” It is also the
highest order in the Celestial hierarchy.
Note the point of resemblance between a
better place and Sweden..
The readiness with which BISMARCK has
acceded to proposals of peace, evinces feel-
ings of so angelic a nature, as to render him
quite the fitting recipient of an emblem,
signifying enrolment among the Seraphim.
He certainly seems more of a Seraph than
a Cherub; for it is the Cherubim especially
that are, sculptured and painted all head
and wings: whereas BISMARCK, whilst a
Statesman endowed with plenty of head,
has considerable body too ; although, to be
sure, he is as yet unfurnished with wings.
That defect, however, might easily be sup-
plied by art, in case the great Chancellor
should choose to appear at Sans Souci on
the occasion, for example, of a fancy-ball
in character as a Member of his new order.
His numerous admirers would doubtless
willingly subscribe to present him with a
pair of golden wings, and a harp framed
of the same material. Thus equipped, he
would look his part to the admiration of
everybody, except his enemies, “those
ribalds," as Mrs. Malaprop calls them,
"the Últramarines." They, indeed, with
M. VEUILLOT at their head, will perhaps
suggest that his wings had better be made
of leather, and that his harp should be re-
placed with a pitchfork.

A HOUSE FOR WHALLEY.
“The Government have engaged to make a House for the

June 7.
“ To make a House for WHALLEY,"
The pledge provokes a smile,
And yet why should not folly
Have its fling, once a while ?
The Borough of St. Peter
Its minster bells should ring,
When, the more scoffed at, the sweeter,
WHALLEY is asked to sing !
When that borough was re-christened,
Nine hundred sixty-three,
In KING EDGAR's eye there glistened
The tear of grateful glee, *
Sprung from conviction thorough,
That in his island home
He had, in Peterborough,
A city fair as Rome!
So lands and gold he gave it,
And a new name, as we see ;
But ah, he could not save it
From a WHALLEY yet to be!
No change could be completer
Than what has come to pass;
In the borough of St. Peter,
WHALLEY, ruler of the mass!
Then sing, thou new Ixion,
Whose wheel turns in thy brain;
While o'er thy foes Stoke's Lion
Shakes the dew-drops of his mane.
In this dizzy drowsy weather,
Of use a laugh will be,
So both sides should pull together
To keep a House for thee!
• A.D. 963, KING EDGAR, with the Archbishops of Canter-

by which the late SIR BALDWIN LEIGH-
Ton raised one of the most pauperised
parishes of England into a model of
parochial government - helping, in the way of out-door
relief, those, and only those, who, thoagh driven to the
parish by temporary pinch or pressure, were yet able and
willing to help themselves, and showing absolute destitu-
tion, sternly, to the Workhouse? At present we are making
paupers in the process of relieving them.
(Commons.) MR. Cross announces that though he cannot this year alter the absurd law as to Sunday amusements, he will pare its
claws in the way of penalties.
Another night of legal Donnybrook-fair “skrimmage" over the Judicature Bill. Every Lawyer seems to have his own view of what
might, could, and should be done in the way of a Court or Courts of Appeal. The battle-field to which Lawyers so rush in, Laymen
may well fear to tread.
Mr. Punch is not ashamed to say be shirks the subject, and advises bis non-legal friends to do likewise, and leave the Lawyers to
fight it out. “Procul, o procul, este profani !” “Hence, avaunt'tis (un) holy ground !"
In Committee on Offences against the Person' Bill, PETER TAYLOR made a determined attempt not to bell, but to burke, the Cat.
TAYLOR against Cat is a natural feud. How should ninth part of a man not hate nine-tailed beast? But the Cat has nine lives, as well
as nine tails, and in this cause may defy all the TAYLORS that ever set goose in array against him. Every argument urged by TAYLOR against
Cat is good against all forms of punishment whatever. What punishment is not degrading, unequal, and, in some sepse, retalia-
tory ? In the case of the brutes for the warming of whose backs alone the new Bill will sharpen the Cat's claws, that the punish-
ment is directly retaliatory is one of its best recommendations. We want to make such ruffians feel something of the pain they bave
inflicted. They can only be made to feel through their bides; and these are so thick, that it needs a sharp scourge to soore them. JOHN
BULL's common sense stands firm for Cat against TAYLOR.
Tuesday (Lords).-LORD BEAUCHAMP brought up the Bill for carving a new Bishopric of St. Alban's out of Rochester and Win-
chester. His Dewly-oreated Grace of St. Alban's will not sit in the Lords. Is this because the Saint's representative was disfranchised
in the Commons ?
LORD SELBORNE sacrificed his Law Schools Bill. Nobody wept that we have heard of.
On Food and Drugs Bill, LORD MORLEY tried-in vain-to strike out the “knowingly," which protects the seller of adulterated
articles till you can prove his knowledge of the adulteration, which in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred is hopeless. Perhaps
the DUKE OF RICHMOND thinks that a consumer only needs legal protection against the adulteration which is done “knowingly."
Against all other adulteration-less “knowingly" managed-caveat emptor- let the buyer protect himself.
(Commons.) Lands' Title and Transfer Bill. Half a loaf is better than no bread. The measure is not much; but what little there is
of it is good, and likely to do good. So pleaded the ATTORNEY-GENERAL against MR. OSBORNE MORGAN'S Motion to kick out the
Bill. The House got into Committee, but no further.
.(Evening Sitting.) The Metropolitan Asylums Board on their defence, for obstinacy and pig-headedness in persisting in the esta-
blishment of a permanent pest-house in a London lung. After a good deal of hot talk, in which MR. FORSYTH attacked the Asylums
Board, and MR. TORRENS carried the attack further to the principle of large permanent hospitals generally, while MR. J. G. TALBOT
defended the Board, MR. SCLATER-Booth, for Government, prooeeded to pour oil upon the troubled waters all round. He believed that
the Asylums Board was the most excellent, useful, and hard working of public Boards; that it was a very bad precedent for the House to
overbaul any exercise of that excellent Board's discretion; that the visitors and residents of Hampstead Heath would be no more
injured by the proposed Hospital than the visitors to Kensington Gardens; and, finally, that it was quite a delusion to suppose that
there was to be any erection of a permanent Hospital at all. (This is news, MR. SCLATER-Booth. What a pity we were not told as
much a little sooner!] But-all this to the contrary notwithstanding the Government had no desire to oppose the appointment of a
Committee, if the House wished it! The House did wish it, very decidedly, and the Motion for a Committee was agreed to.
Then the susceptible Doctor rose to move for leave to bring in a Bill for Establishing Triennial Parliaments, and the House was

force of police, penalties, and public opinion
united cannot keep the sot from his liquor.
Your Maine toss-pot will “kiss the baby” in
spite of all the Law may say or do to prevent
him. And though SIR WILFRID may try to
laugh that fact down, it remains still a great
fact against his Permissive Bill.
Thursday (Lords.)- LORD ROSEBERY delivered
himself of a long and carefully-prepared dis-
course on the Artisans' Dwellings Bill-to
what issue, or with what intention, it is not
easy to see. But his Lordship is a rising and
industrious young Peer, and if he likes to hear
himself talk,
Say, shall Punch damp such rare desire,
Upon young eloquence's fire
Cold water dropping ?
No! Out-talk lordings of thy years,
As Yorkshire hills one hill o'er-peers -
Rosebery Topping!
(Commons.) After a good deal of “confused”
question and answer, the ATTORNEY-GENERAL
moved the Norwich Corrupt Practices Inquiry
Commission, amid some murmurs from that
"par nobile fratrum" WHALLEY and his
Doctor. This drew forth an edifying revela-
tion from MR. BRIGHT of how Norwich eleo-
tions used to be-and, no doubt, still are-at
the mercy of a residuum of a few hundreds,
who in that venerable borough uphold the
anoient British elector's birthright-his bribe
and his beer-that right over which Big Ben
has still the solitary courage to toll a regretful
requiem.
When the House should have got into Com-
mittee on the Merchant Shipping Bill, MR. E.
SMITH set the bad example-in which half-
a-dozen talkers were ill-advised enough to
follow him-of delivering himself, at much
length, of his opinions on the Bill, which
had better have been kept for Committee.
So Progress, having been unduly impeded,
was reported at Clause 8, on the vexed ques-
tion of advance-notes, which appear to be
now used- not for the profit of wives and
children, as they were meant to be, but of
crimps, liquor-sellers, and the other harpies
who keep watch for the coin of poor JACK."
The Doctor then got an innings on Trien-
nial Parliaments, and the House, instead of
Counting him Out again, definitely refused
him leave to bring in his Bill, by 68 to 11, at
ten minutes past three in the morning!
Friday,—The Lords were glad to be assured

MR. DISRAELI gave notice the Government would want Tuesdays for the rest of the
Session. General grumbling! “Do they make such a good use of the nights they have,
that we should give them another ?"
Tuesday (Lords). - Second and Third Readings of a batch of “unconsidered trifles," knocked off between opening the doors and
twenty-five minutes past five.
(Commons.) MR. HARDY, in MR. DISRAELI's absence, moved the modest demand for Government precedence on Tuesdays.
Suppressed grumbling found many voices—LORD HÁRTINGTON'S, MR. FORSYTH'S, MR. FAWCETTS, MR. DILLWYN's, LORD ESLING-
TON's." "Honourable Members could not be in two places at once, like SIR BOYLE ROCHE's famous Irish birds.” How was he, and
many another “infelix Theseus " like him, to attend at once to his Committee work and his Morning Sittings ?
MR. NEWDEGATE declared the “Order"-book-ironically so called—“ could only be compared to a waste-paper basket turned upside
down"-(MR. NEWDEGATE deserves a Cartoon for his suggestion, and Punch gives him one). “Government had got into a mess, and
now coolly claimed all the time of the House to get out of it."
Poor MR. HARDY, bowing his head to the pelting of this pitiless storm from all sides, recommended adjournment till Thursday,
when MR. DISRAELI would be present to fight for himself.
If the Morning Sitting was stormy, at the Evening Sitting it literally “blew great guns." MR. HANBURY TRACY (a gallant naval
officer) moved the reappointment of the Ordnance Select Committee to act as a buffer between the Departments and the public. No
doubt we had the best great guns going ; but still it would be very comfortable if there was a break of big names naval and military,
engineers (the civiller the better) and artillerists, to say, and, if need be, swear as much, and to prevent collisions between the
Departments and those most troublesome of bores, the Inventors. CAPTAIN PRICE (a brother tar, but not tarred with the same brush),
moved, as an amendment, the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the best way of furnishing the Navy with guns more
trustworthy and efficient, our present armament being neither one nor the other. The gallant Captain (a gunnery officer, be it
remembered) has since followed up his speech by a letter to the Times, in which he offers to bet any odds that the Monarch cannot fire two
hundred rounds from her guns under fighting conditions without disabling one half of them.
MR. HANBURY TRACY writes next day, to prove that CAPTAIN PRICE has put his foot in it awfully, by this letter. (It is quite
wonderful how these artillery doctors differ.)
. MR. E. J. REED backed up CAPTAIN PRICE. We were on a wrong road in our gunnery, and the sooner our artillery-heads were set in
the right direction the better."
(At the same time it may be as well to remember that MR. REED was once SIR B. WHITWORTH's partner; and that the Battle of the
Guns has come to be something very like a duel between those gallant knights, WHITWORTH and ARMSTRONG.

MARTYRS AND MARTYRS.
At a meeting held the other
day, under the presidency of the
DUKE OF NORFOLK, supported by
several noblemen and gentlemen,
at the Roman-Catholic school-
room in Great Prescot Street,
Tower Hill, the subjoined resolu-
tion, moved by LORD O'HAGAN,
was “carried by acclamation":-
“That this meeting acknowledges
the appropriateness of raising in the
| vicinity of Tower Hill the new Church
of the English Martyrs as a memorial
of those heroic conservers of Catholic
faith who shed their blood upon
that spot, or who underwent painful
captivity in the Tower."
Apart from the foregoing ex-
planation, most Britons would
understand by “English Mar-
tyrs” those heretics who were
burnt alive in Smithfield, at Ox-
ford, and elsewhere, chiefly under
good QUEEN Mary. Most sects
have their Martyrs — to their
great mutual credit. It will be
seen that the Martyrs above re-
ferred to are not Foxe's, but
might rather be styled FAWKES'S
Martyrs.
