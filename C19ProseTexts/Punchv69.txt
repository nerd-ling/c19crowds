PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

\
THE New Year found PONCH on his way to India, to join the Priuce Incog. He halted en route to give a word of counsel
to his frit ml CAVE at Cairo.
"Shall PUNCH come within sight of the Pyramids, and not climb the biggest? On my eyes be it!" cried the
KHEDIVE, as he lighted his last cigarette after a snug dinner given to his Great Guest and his new Finance Commissioner—
whom he persists in calling " Adullam," because to him, as to that Cave of old, resort those who are in debt and difficulty and
discontent.
Straightway an escort of Pashas and Beys, Agas and Effendees, an army of Arabs—horse and man—dragomen and
khavasses, cooks and .chiboukjees and cafeedjees—was at MB. PUNCH'S orders. But with a majestic wave of the hand, at once
gracious and uumistakeable, that potentate dismissed the backsheesh-breathing brood.
"When PUNCH visits a poor country, 'tis to make it richer not poorer; and when PUNCH meets a Pyramid, it
must be alone!"
So he went, and gazed, and climbed—with no escort of clamorous touts or howling donkey-drivers to mar the solemnity
of that great encounter between the mightiest of mirth-makers and the most majestic of monuments.
Unaided, except by the tail of Toby, he climbed the highest of those sepulchral giants, and stood, at last, on the plat-
form that forms its apex—awe-struck, awe-striking, and—save for his faithful Toby, alone!
Morning had not yet broken. The sun was just peeping above the eastern horizon, little expecting on what a guest
his eye would fall. Above PUNCH'S head still twinkled the stars; below him gleamed the Desert sands through the mist of Nile.
But PUNCH questioned not the Stars of the Future they will not reveal; nor the Sands of the Past tney nold buried.
His eye followed the opalescent winding of the New Cut—not that which binds the transpontine Roads of Waterloo and
Blackfriars, but that which, interpontine, links the roadsteads of Alexandria and Suez—the Canal which LORD PALMEBSTON
did his best to burke, and M. LESSEPS his better, to plan, preach up, finance, and finish—the Canal which swallowed a great
many thousands of Egyptian fellahs' lives, and more thousands of European fellows' capital—the Canal which drained the
KHEDIVE'S spare cash, and opened a new road to India,—the Canal of Good Hope, vice the Cape of ditto superseded.
"And tliat," soliloquised PUNCH, "is the Sewer of Sewers"—("Suez," barked TOBY, correctively)—"into which
England is about to throw Four Millions of her money—unless Parliament thinks better of it, that is,—which is quite
possible!"
"And is Four Millions, or four times four, a penny too much for BRITANNIA to pay for her Indian door-key?" Such
was the question that vibrated on PUNCH'S tympanum in a thin and thrilling voice, at once foreign and familiar, strangely
blending melodious music, cynical mockery, and muffled meaning.
Upon that platform, from which Sixty-Eight Volumes of PUNCH, arm-in-arm with Forty Centuries of Time, were now
contemplating the world at their feet, save Ma. PUNCH himself, was none of articulate-speaking mortals who could have put
the question. Was it PUNCH'S thought made audible in the stillness of that weird solitude? Was it the Mummy of

[JANUARY 8, 1876.
KING CHEOPS—still sarcophagused in the labyrinthine recesses of the star-y-pointing Pyramid, to mock generations of Egypto-
logists, past, present, and to come—that had all at once found a tongue within his desiccated jaws? Was it TOBY, suddenly
revealed as Anubis, his ancestral Egyptian god, with his bark translated by the genius loci into intelligible oracle.,?, ^
"Own the coup a master-stroke, worthy of our great forefather MOSES, who first taught Jews the spoiling of Egyp-
tians." They were the same accents, but this time with a dry chuckle making a running bass to their music. And then
PUNCH knew it was the voice of the Great Asian Mystery—the utterance of the riddling oracle of Semitic wisdom—the speech
of the inscrutable, immutable, unfathomable SPHINX. Yes, they were the great granite lips of the Colossal Head—which
reared its impassive brow and stony eye-balls from the waves of the eand-sea far below—that sent forth that mysterious music.
And PUNCH braced himself for the encounter; for he knew that the Inexhaustible Fountain of Double Acrostics was about to
be let loose upon him, and that, like CEmpus, he must answer aright, or die. But asking questions, especially of the SPHINX,
is easier than answering them; so PUNCH determined to put in his cross-fire of interrogatories, before the Great Fountain-head
of My stery could flash forth its riddle.
"You call MOSES your groat fjrefathfr?"
"Is not the SPHINX of the seed of the SEPBARBIM?"
"Of what tribe?"
"Of the tribe of BENJAMIN."
"Then you are not Egyptian?"
"Neither of the Copts, nor the Fellaheen, nor tbe Hyksos. I am a Hebrew of the Heb-dws —and never felt so
proud of my blood as now."
"But how came jou to be left behind when the rest of ycur race emigrated from the Land of Goshen?"
"The tribes had a great deal of money mt on good security, and I stsyed to look after it. Do yon suppose our
dealings with Pharaoh's people fcegan and ended with the unredeemed pledges we carried across tie Red Sea?"
Here the granite lips curled contemptuously, and a sudden darkness—it might have been the shadow of a cloud,
but it had all the effect of a wink—passed across one of the stony eyeballs.
"But this purchase of the KHEDIVE'S Canal Shares?"
"'What is the best investment BKITANNIA can make of Four Millions?" Such was the riddle propounded to
LORD DERBY—by me—through one of our people. Of course he couldn't answer it—when was ever Foreign Secretary of
English Blood that could? But there was one set over him—a sen of my seed—my BENJAMIN. He sent the answer
by return of post; and another son of my people, though of the scorned AeKEENAzm, ttood, with the millions ready to
draw on at sight. And so the Great Riddle of the SPHINX was answered—and the SPHINX "an smile to see that her
seed is rot degenerate,—that her tons still know, and teach by example, that there are re . which it ncay be worth
wise men's while to pave with gold"
"And with what is more precious even than gold, O SPHINX!" shouted PUNCH. "Here goes for the first stone of
that inestimable pavement!" And with a majestic motion he hurled down to the Desert sands below, from which straightway
burst forth a fountain of laughing waters—

WHAT IT MAY—BUT'LET'S HOPE IT WON'T—
COMB TO i
(Dedicated, with Mr. Punch's compliments, to the " United
Artillerists.")
HOUSE OF COJIUONS. JUKE —TH, 187—?
THE SPEAKER took the Chair at four o'clock.
M A.IOI: SMITH then rose to propose his Motion (of which he had
given notice during the previous sitting), that "this Honourable
House do immediately form itself into a Committee to consider the I
present condition of the Woolwich guns." The Honourable and
Gallabt Member said that it was most mlvisaMo that the House
should examine the rival plans submitted by those whb were in
favour of breech-loading, on the one hand, and
An Honourable Member apologised for interrupting his honour-
able and gallant friend, but he wished to ask a question of the
SECRETARY OF STATE FOB WAR. ("Hear, hear!") Was it true
that the enemy had landed on the previous evening at Dover, as
reported in the morning papers? (Cheers.)
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR was understood^ request
the Honourable Member to give notice of his question in the cus-
tomary manner.
MAJOR SMITH continued his speech. He said that it was most
important that every one should understand the principle of breech-
loading artillery.
Another Honourable Member apologised for interrupting the
Honourable and Gallant Member, but he wished to ask the HOME
SECRETARY a question of some importance. ("Hear, hear ! ") Was
it true that the enemy had that morning occupied Dorking, as
reported in the second edition of the Times f (Cheers.]
The HOME SECRETARY was understood to say that he considered
that no attention should be paid to reports published in the press.
MA JOB SMITH continued his speech. He said.that muzzle-load ing
had been generally adopted in the Service until attention had been
called to the many defects of that system. The matter had often
been ventilated in that House. (" Hear, hear.'") Hon. Members
would remember that the matter had consequently been allowed to
remain in statu quo for some time.
A. third Honourable Member apologised for interrupting the
Honourable and Gallant Member, but he wished to put a question to
the CHANCELLOR OF TIIE EXCHEQUER. _ ("Hear, hear.'") Was
there any truth in the report (current in the City) that the enemy
had just taken the Bank of England Y (Cheers.')
The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER was understood to admit
that a rumour to that effect had certainly reached the Treasury.
The Right Honourable Gentleman begged to add, however, that the
report required official confirmation.
MAJOR Sunn continued his speech. He said it was moat desirable
that this great country (the most powerful in the world) should be
prepared to meet any emergency.
At this point, a General of the enemy (who had just entered the
House) called the attention of the SPEAKER to the fact that there
were not forty Members present.
House Counted Out at twenty minutes past four o'clock.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXED, appa-
Jrtntly by
something in
the Public
Health Bill
(Lordt, Mon-
day,JunelS),
the DUKE OF SOMER-
SET, who, sober not
to say saturnine as
he seems, is fond—
perhaps by that in-
fluence of a name, to
which the Greeks
ascribed so much—of
going head over heels
into unexpected at-
titudes, treated the
Government to a
"jobation" for
harassing legislation
in their Artisans'
Dwellings, Agricul-
tural Holdings, and
Rivers Pollution
Bills.
The Duke seems
to forget that all
these Bills, however
they might have been used to harass in
days gone by, have had their poison-
fangs of compulsion extract* d by the
cunning hand of the snake-charmer,
BEN-DIZZJT.
LORD SAirsBUBr administered some retaliatory
pepper, in effect recommending his ducal critic tu ten
more and to say lens.
(Common*.) MB. BOURKE promptly and curtly
burktd MB. BUTLEK-JOUNSTONE'S curiosity ubout
Greece. The Government has no information to give on
the very disagreeable subject; but has no reamn to
believe that Greece is more a-broil, or a-bublile, or
a-stew, or a-fret—however the normal condition of
Greece may best be described—than usual.
MB. CROSS'S Employers and Workmen Bill read a
Second Time, to a general chorus of commendation.
Never did performer in the Legislative "ground and lofty line"
make his bow amid a more brilliant blaze of triumph.
Appreciating the difficulty of getting the Lamb of Labour and
the Lion of Capital- or should the brutes and attributes be counter-
changed?—to lie down together, and honouring good intentions—par-
ticularly when they escape consignment to the paving department
"down-stairs,"—Punch is proud to present MR. CBOSS his compli-
ments, with a Cartoon.
As artful composers enhance their harmonies by a subtle dash of
discord, any risk of mawkishness in this chorus of " Bravo CBOSS 1"
was obviated by the harsh discords and unpleasing sharps of LOBD
ROBERT MONTAGTT, who denounced MB. CROSS as "a captive to the cloven
hoof of Capital," bent on beating down wages, and making a slave of the
Working-man; defended "rattening" and "picketting," as mere Working-men's counterparts of distraint and Parliamentary
"whipping;" and, generally, dragged nis coat through the fair in a spirited, though decidedly exaggerated, imitation of the wild Irish
boy, challenging such unanimity of disavowal as the House of Commons seldom concedes to even the most full-blown folly.
MR. CBOSS really deserves such great credit that Punch is not nice to mark what the House may have given him over and above
strict measure.
MESSRS. BUBT and MACDONALD, Working-men Members, energetically disclaimed agreement with LORD ROBERT MONTAGUE, and
admitted the honest intent, fairness, and general merits of the HOME SECRETARY'S Bill:—
Then,
Irrepressible HUBBABD
The House took to snub hard,
Sinking Fund when he moved to postpone:
Not a seconder there
Could he get, so, inns pair,
HISTBR HUBBARD was snuffed out alone!
Twitlay (Lords).—Half-a-dozen Bills were rattled through Committee with a Chifney rush before their Lordships adjourned at
twenty-five minutes to six.
(Common*). At two, MR. LOWE—quantum mutatus ab ilia, LOWE—brought forward the grievances of the Competition-Wallahs, who
"in the cold North (West)'sunhallowed shade"languish under slow promotion and small salaries, while more favoured servants, civil
and military, who had never passed the al Sirat of competition, ily over their heads on wings of favour, or from the spring-board of the
backstairs. He—even he—the BOB LOWE, whom we knew with such a grim scorn of grievances and grievance-mongers, and such
a close grip on JOHN BULL'S purse-strings—suggested pecuniary compensation—what it is to be out of office!—but ended by asking
for a Select Committee. The India Office admits there is a grievance, and will urge it on the Indian Government. On this assurance
the Right Honourable ROBERT LOWE retired from his unwonted position, and withdrew his Motion and his demand.
LOBD ELCHO asked MR. HAKDY whether it was the fact that of seven thousand Army Reserve men invited to attend the Summer

Parlour Staid (to Cook). "I KNOWED THAT MB. SMITH WASN'T NO GKNTLB-
MAN I WHICH HE NRVKK RAISED HIS 'AT TO ME W11KN 1 LET 'iM OUT AT THE

Drills, only twenty had sent an answer. Ma. HAKBT indignantly denied it.
Answers had been received from 114 out of fewer, he was certain, than 7000
to whom summons had been sent, though he couldn't exactly say how many had
been asked. But it is pretty clear that—many or few1-our paper-reserve, in
the field non est imeitlus. "Mock Reserves," the cynic may say, "suit mock
Manoeuvres."
In the evening a Count-Out, and no business done.
Wednesday.—An Irish morning's work on MB. BUTT'S Bill for Establishing
Irish County Boards.
SIR M. H. BEACH gave a sketch of what such Boards, in the Government
opinion, ought to be, and promised a Bill, but not for this Session. After which
promise, MB. BUTT, taking a division, was beaten by 182 to 125—many English
Liberals being glad to show their approval of a reasonable measure out of that
Butt.
Thursday (Lords).—Committee on the Rivers Pollution Bill, now very
Bcientifically relieved of its back-bone:—
"The times have been
That when the brains were out the ' Bill' would die,
And there an end; but now they rise again,
Nerveless and marrowless, their ' musts' turned ' mays,'
To keep ua on our stools."
(Commons.) MB. HABDY spoke a good word—not before it was wanted, and
not more, Punch quite believes, than is due—on behalf of those armed Apollos
of the Knightsbridge Barracks who may be said to make the "six-foot way"
over the hearts of the British nursemaid of the Metropolis. Their conduct,
MB. HABDT says, is unexceptionable; their officers strict; their houses of call
tans reproche. it is not the military—the mounted military, at least—that keep
up the blackguard haunts of the neighbourhood. So let our gallant Life and
Horse Guardsman—red or blue—ride on, stainless as his own pipe-clayed
buckskins in their first hour of wear—
"Sotto 1'uabergo dell sentirsi puro."
Or (for the benefit of non-readers of DANTE in the original)—
"Under the corslet of a conscience pure."
As introductory to Supply, on the Education Estimates, Loan ESLINGTON
told the pitiful story of MBS. MAHKS in full detail—
showing now the School-Board officer's zeal had in that
case outrun both discretion and humanity, and moving
a Resolution. MB. SANDFOBD seconded it in a diatribe
on School-Boards, in which those Boards were painted
blacker than any hung in their own school-rooms.
There is truth enough in MB. SANDFORD'S picture to
make those who believe in and hope from, and have
striven and still strive for, National Education, wince
under the sore sense of means wasted and efforts mis-
directed.
But bad as the ease may be between priggish and
pedantic masters and mistresses, over-taught in much
that is least necessary and sadly under-taught in most
that is most essential, and pupils who cannot even be got
to school and kept there long enough to learn anything
that will profit them,—it is better than it was; and the
Education Department is trying honestly to fulfil its
many hard tasks, and to make the best of its many bad
bargains. We are improving, however slowly and par-
tially. To this the general testimony seems conclusive.
Friday (Lords).—A. talk about the glut of Naval
Officers. The DUKE OF SOMERSET put the pinch of the
matter pithily—"To have officers enough in war, you
must have too many in peace." In fact, it is the neces-
sity felt in other branches besides the Navy of a " great
reduction on taking a quantity." The difficulty may
be palliated but can't be prevented; and different
Boards must be left to deal with it by different schemes.
LOBD DUSSANY thought that the success of CAPTAIN
WALTER with his Commissionnaire Corps might supply a
hint for employment of reduced Naval Officers!—very
much reduced, indeed!
(Commons.) The Captain of the Devastation reports
her (from Ragusa) "the sweetest ship, between decks,
he ever sailed in." And " the ugliest, above them, to
look at," he might have added.
Great fun! The Members for Weymouth, Poole.
Portsmouth, the Isle of Wight, and Southampton all
puffing the advantages of their respective boroughs over
Dartmouth as the site of a Naval College!
It was quite a lark. The House roared, as each
Member, with his tongue in his cheek, paraded the
claims of his constituency. Finally, MB. CHILDEBS
suggested a doubt, which Saturday's Times goes far to
deepen into a conviction, whether there is any occasion
for a Naval College at all. If the Cadets are not to go
atloat till sixteen, why not fix a pass-examination, and
leave them to qualify for it where, and as, parents and
guardians please.
MB. ISouBKE (for Foreign Office) declines to produce
the instructions on which LORDS COWLEY and CLARENDON
signed the Declaration of Paris; and the CHANCELLOR
of the EXCHEQUER does not see his way to interfero
with the Civil Service Co-operative Stores, at the
demand of the London Shopkeepers.
PH5TSIC FOR TIPSY MANIACS.
AMONG the principal members of the deputation, con-
sisting largely of Clergy and Medical Men, who waited
the other day upon the HOME SECBETABY with a
Memorial inviting the Government to carry out the re-
commendations of a Select Committee for the control
and management of Habitual Drunkards, otherwise
caUed Dipsomaniacs, one gentleman whose name in con-
nection with his errand may appear remarkable was
DR. LUSH, M.P. Dipsomania is both the effect of lush,
and the cause of craving for more lush. By lush Dip-
somania is also curable. Similia similibus—not exactly
as the Dipsomaniac, or sot, as we used to say, physics
himself o" mornings with the prescription of a nair of
the dog that bit you." But let him only pursue a steady
course of intoxicating liquors, taken in infinitesimal
quantities and no larger, and lush will certainly cure
him. Homoeopathy never fails in Dipsomania.
TOAST AND SENTIMENT FOB JULY.
SUCCESS to the Public Worship Bill, now come into
operation. May it enforce agreement between their
Reverences and their Worships.
WHAT THIS GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE CALLED.—The
Permissive Ministry.

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OB, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIYE ART.
By LEOHAKDO DKT.LV IJ.OBBU DE TUDQR WBSTPOND TUMPKYNS,
ESQ., 8.4.8., A,$.F., M.U.F., and ttan. Member of the Dulli-
ilillitanty Svcit-iy.

EOPLE nowadays
know simply no-
thing about fur-
nishing, on which
subject, everyone,
present company
always exeepted,
is a perfect fool.
A perfect fool,
however, is, in
art, better than an
imperfect fool.
Anybody possessing a house, and thoroughly pleased with it, will
find fault with everybody else's house. When you take such a
prejudiced individual into your dining-room, and show him the
window, he will pooh-pooh it. If he does, after showing him the
window, show him the door.

X
°
Household Decorative Art includes furniture, useful and useless.
Furnishing should be under-
taken on the principle of
Natural Selection.
Chairs.—The utile in a chair-
frame, for example, should be
combined with the duke in the
cushioning.
A chair, like an objectionably
obtrusive person, is made to b»
sat upon.
That is the use of a chair.
The abuse of a chair is what
you say when the leg gives way,
or the seat comes out suddenly.
If you are very hungry, you can carve the leg of a chair.


Easu Ghair.—This sort of chair is so called from its being any-
thing but easy to find one.
Everyone hoi his own ideas of comfort.
In a Grammar of Decorative Art, our first hint will, naturally,
oome under the heading of
Article.—There are all sorts of Articles required in a house, from
mi ornamental, and useful, dnnt-pan to a grand piano. Do not think

that your time will be wasted even in designing a dust-pan _and a
dust-brush. Pan, remember, was a classical divinity, and this will

give you a suggestion. If it won't, we can't help you, except by
giving you a design oi our
own for a Gothic Dust
Pan, representing the e_x-
terior ot a Cathedral, with
the Church-yard for the
dust: Motto carved on the
shovel, Cineres Misera-
Iriles, i.e., Miserable Cin-
ders.
In furnishing there are
definite articles (aa the one
abovementioned) and in-
definite articles, as, for
instance, anything we
haven't mentioned, or are
not likely to mention.
An Indefinite Article in
our Grammar of Furniture
is something that you
don'fj know what on earth
it is intended for—whether
it's a bootjack, or a coal-
scuttle, or an ann-ohair, or
a poker, or all by turns
and nothing long?
Mind, if you can get an
indefinite article which
shall be equally service-
able as a poker or a gridiron or an ann-ehair, or a grand piano,
don't part with it on any account, for you have a treasure.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
The article may be singular, as, for example, something of this
sort:—

Or it may be plural, which depends upon what reply you give to
the shopman, when he rubs his hands, and inquires, " What's the
next article, M'mP"

(To In continued.)
A BAKER ON LIGHT BREAD.
A UTKTURY and logical Baker has written the letter below quoted
on—
"THE BREAD QUESTION.
"To the Editor of the Hampshire Independent.
"BIB,—Having been a receiver of your valuable paper ever since its com-
mencement, I beg a small space in it be allowed to me for satisfaction to the
mind. I saw two letters in your paper of Saturday, the 5th iast., one from a
convicted baker, the other (as I suppose) fearing conviction. They were both
anonymously signed. I beg to ask why it was so unmanly done? In my
opinion it is next to confession of their supposed guilt. A poor bread baker
need not be ashamed of his name to withhold it from the public, as I firmly
believe they have as honest a face as their convictor. The bakers have not
robbed the public."
No._ The Bakers have not robbed the Public of a crumb. Only
—their apologist proceeds immediately to explain—
"They have deceived their customers by cutting short weight in dough,
and lopping off a penny in the (supposed) eight-pound loaf."
Then, he indignantly demands—
"From whence comes the very letter of the law to be brought into action?"
In answer to that question our letter-writer confesses,
"I must «ay the bakers years gone by acted more like birds of prey to their
brother batch for the sake of custom, which has brought a rod about our backs,"
But the case is—
"Very efferent now, we soil bread all alike in price, but the scent has not
left us."
Now the Bakers hang together, not, however, some people may
think, as they deserve. They only get fined. But "the scent has
not left" them. They remain in ill odour.
Next come the following liberal and candid admissions :—
"We all know we are bound by law to sell bread by weight. Had we kept
so close to the law as we might have done this contention would never arose.
I see but little fault to find with either magistrates or police; they have their
duty to perform."
Still the Magistrates do the Bakers some injustice; but in venial
ignorance:—
"At Southampton a police-constable stated to the Bench that other Bakers
had been visited, and oread on weighing found some over weight. If the
reader of the Independent will look in that paper he will see the reply from
the Bench, and I can say ' Father, forgive them, they know not what they
eayeth, being perfectly unacquainted with the trade.'
The text pointing the above passage appears to have been
quoted from the somewhat hazy reminiscence of a mind, let us hope,
unaware rather than regardless of its inaccuracy—and impropriety.
Argument succeeds iteration:—
"Suppose if a loaf is short weight, what then? When bread is sirteen-
pence per gallon it is only half a farthing per ounce—much lesa, then, now.
We all know that bread gets lighter as it gets older. But is the virtue gone?
No; it has increased in quality, or why do the people with large families
prefer stale bread?"
Here our logician's acuteness fails him a little. Do not people
with large families prefer stale bread chiefl. ybeeause among children
its consumption is less than that of new? However, he proceeds:—
"I don't suppose there is a doctor to be found that will recommend new
bread to be eaten; it has always been considered injurious to health—but if
stale when eaten, it ia lighter in weight but improved in quality. Therefore,
where is the evil f"
Why, the evil is in not allowing dough enough to the loaf—not
applying the knowledge thai bread loses weight out of the oven.
But the plea that the improved quality of stale bread atones for its
short quantity is admirable. So is the concluding peroration:—
"I do think the agitator of this vexed question would do wisely to bend his
knees and pray for the safety of his own soul instead of persecuting poor
innocent bread bakers. As for bakers being persecuted more than any other
trade, we will pass that over with a grin. It would look very unseemly to
see the miller's waggon cumbered up with his weights and scales as we poor
bakers have been so long. But I see no reason for their exemption ; paint us
all with one brush. It's the law we have to contend with, and we shall have
to abide by it till it is altered. But the agitator may not press the very letter
of that law to be carried into execution in this law more than many others.
Let him that is without a fault cast the first stone."
A text again—rather closer to the original this time. The Baker
to whom we are indebted for the flowers above culled is no
anonymous scribe. He signs himself as follows :—
"I am, Sir, &c., JOHN RICHARDS,
A convicted Baker; a bread baker, and seller of bread
39 years, and never served this trick before.
Sranstone, I. W."
MB. RICHARDS is evidently himself not a flower that was "born
to blush unseen"—if, indeed, to blush at all. He was "never
served this trick before." That is, apparently, he was never before
during thirty-nine years detected and fined. No doubt he sells
excellent bread, and will take care in future to prevent any com-
plaint that there is too little of it.
THE BASER SORT AT BIRMINGHAM.
FROM the subjoined statement it appears that the Electors of
Birmingham include a very considerable quantity of what their
Right Honourable Member calls the residuum:—
"DR. KENEALY, accompanied by MB. OMSLOW and MB. WHALLEY, went
to Birmingham on Saturday, and was received at the railway station by a
largo crowd. The horses were taken from DK. KBNEALY'B carriage, which
was then drawn by the people. A meeting was held in the Town Hall in the
evening, at which a letter was read from MB. JOHN BBIGHT, stating that he
declined to attend. A resolution was passed pledging the meeting to use all
legal and constitutional means for the restoration of the convict at Dartmoor
to liberty."
Clearly MB. BRIGHT has a great many constituents who would be
much more fitly represented by MK. ONSLOW, or MR. WHALLEY;, or
DR. KENEALY. They showed not so much respect to ORION'S advo-
cate as self-appreciation by drawing his carriage. For awhile they
constituted that vehicle a donkey-chaise.

HJNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JOLT 10, 1875.
A TllEAT FOR THE SULTAN.
WE certainly have pretty nearly done our best, or worst, to tire
our guest, the SULTAN. Froiu sight to bight we ve hurried him in
weather tine or wet; by rail and road we've scurried him with
speed lie won't for-
get. We have bortd
him with big din-
ners and the bang-
ing of big gnns;
we have baited him
with deputations,
corporations, and
the like; und we
have brought him
forth to balls, when
he had rather have
gone to bed.
But there id one
thing in the way <.f
wear} ing his High-
ness, which we have
somehow neglect-
fully omitted. We
have not given him
an hour's drive in
a licensed four-
wheeled cab. This
would have put a
climax on the la-
bours of his visit,
and impressed it
iqetfaceahly upon
his recollection. The
fatigue of being
jiJti-d in a shabby
old four - winder,
over a short distance
of certain of our
(streets, would have
rriade him think hut
lightly of the other
wajs of weariness
wheiewith we have
afllicted him.
8etiug sights, arid
being spouted at by
pmsy deputations,
would seem but trill-
ing torments com-
pared to being boxed
up in a stuffy old
four-wheeler, with
rattling doors and
windows, and at-
tenuated springs;
and after undergo-
ing half-an-hour of
such torture, the
SULTAN doubtless
would resolve to try
it on the slave-tra-
ders whom he is en-
deavouring to sup-
press in Zaiixibur.
Moreover, it would
certainly enhance
his admirali.ai of
this country, accept-
ing admiration as a
synoiiy m for wonder,
which the Diction-
ary permits. Of all
the wonders we have
shown him, none
would surely seem
more marvellous
than that a people
esteemed civilised should content themselves with riding in such
barbarous contrivances as are sanctioned by our Legislature; and
that a nation who can build a world-defying iron-clad should be
incapable of building a comfortable cab.

'REGULATIONS
[SPECIAL CIRCULAR.]
FOR

WIMBLEDON.
July 5, 1875.
IELD-MABSHAL PUNCH, Chie:
Inspector-General of the
Auxiliary Forces, &o. &o.
acting for himself, and foi
his able and distinguishec
colleague, SIB GARNET WOL
SELEY, 0.C.B., &o. &o. (ah-
eent on special service al
the Cape of Good Hope),
begs to inform the troopi
under his immediate com-
mand, that he has noticed,
with much pain, in years
gone by, the want of dis-
cipline often observable in
the Volunteer Encampment,
held annually at Wimble-
don.
The Field-Marshal would
remind Riflemen that (1)
the Camp in question should
be a School of Instruction,
rather than a pic-nic; that
(2) for the nonce Volunteer*
should consider themselves
soldiers rather than civi-
lians; and, finally, that (3)
., „ , ... ... England expects (during
the first half of July, at »ny rate) that every man should do his
duty.
With a view to insuring uniformity, the Field-Marshal besrs that
the following regulations maybe strictly observed by all taking part
in this year's gathering. He may add that experience has taught
him that none of the rules published below can be considered
unnecessary.
DRESS.
Officers ordered to attend Full Dress Parade, will not appear in
white neck-ties, lavender kid gloves, and swallow-tailed coats. A
projected visit to the Opera (after the Parade has been dismissed)
will not in future be accepted as an excuse for disobeyance of this
order.
^'on-Commissioned Officers taking part in Battalion Drill should
never unfurl their umbrellas without the command of a Brigadier
General.
Head-Dresses known as "Billy-Cock Hats," should not be used
(as a rule) during Company drill.
Fancy grey Overcoats (with black velvet collars and cuffs) should
not be worn over tweed shooting-jackets and regulation trousers on
parade in fine weather.
A Major (in the absence of his Commanding Officer) should never
hold a Church Parade in a straw-hat, a sword, and a pair of
goloshes.
Kid-Gloves should never be of more than three distinct patterns
and colours when worn by Privates belonging to the same Company.
DRILL.
The Order " March at ease " will not be considered, in future, as
tantamount to a permission for a Company to ride home oa the out-
side of an omnibus.
Guides should not explain the theory of Billiards or the rules of
Lawn-tennis to their Markers during the formation of four-deep
square.
Not more than a dozen Privates (to each Company) should speak
at once on the call of "Attention!" Constant disregard of this
rule will be found to cause some confusion, especially in the per-
formance of brigade movements.
Regimental wags are cautioned against repeating stale jokes in
wheeling from column into tine. Allusions to "a sad Mess" or
an odd File" will in future be considered an infringement of this
regulation.
Bunts.
No Band in futnte will be permitted to take np its station within
a radius of six yards from another Band.
i.Asua 'i11*6' Ban^8 practising within ten yards of one another,
snouwselect tunes of more or less the same character. For instance,
a .Band Aplays a quadrille, Band B should rehearse the " Lancers •"
it a and C commence a polka, Band D may perform a lively waltz;
and so on. It may be taken for granted that the Old Hundredth
does not altogether agree with the Military March out of Fatttt.
lha two tunes should be seldom played at th« same time.
In conclusion, FIELD-MABSHAL PUNCH begs to state that he will
during the course of the encampment, pay several visits to Wimble-
don, with a view to seeing that the above regulations are properly
carried out by Officers commanding regiments and other responsible
officials. He trusts that the Volunteers will cheerfully assume the
motto " Ready, aye Ready!"
He begs to remind them that he has, from the first, given them
his support, that they have never been lacking in zeal, and that
they only require discipline to make them the finest soldiers in the
world.
He trusts that they will enable him, on this occasion, to submit a
highly favourable report of their merits to the master they both
serve—the British Public.

Ma. PUNCH has received thousands of letters upon the subject of
Railway Carriages for Ladies. He is forced (by the exigences of
space) to publish only a selection from the many valuable contribu-
tions that have been addressed to him at his Office upon this all-
absorbing topic of conversation:—
Primrose Cottage.
Miss BRIDGET WALLFLOWER presents her compliments to Mr.
Punch, and begs to inform him that, for the last thirty years, she
has invariably patronised Ladies' Carriages on her railway journeys.
During that time she has never suffered any inconvenience from the
rude attentions of the male sex. Miss BRIDGET WALLFLOWER begs
to add that, as she is now just twenty-nine years of age, and is
considered handsome, she thinks a continuation of the precautions
she has hitherto taken absolutely necessary.
DF.AB MR. PUNCH,

POLLY RAPID.
MY DEAR SIB, Minerva Villa.
AFTER mature consideration, I have come to the conclusion
that Ladies' Carriages are unnecessary. The education of most
women (owing to the barbarous cruelty of man) has been deplorably
neglected, and, consequently, female conversation is usually vapid
and uninteresting. I confess that I like exchanging ideas with men

of talent and experience. It is only fair to say that I have been
greatly edified by the remarks of many learned Professors with
whom I have travelled during my many railway journeys. I am

I AM quite afraid of writing to you—I am indeed! But I

really can't help it. (I like a middle-aged man so much. You
creatures look better, speak better, and are altogether better at that
age than at any other! You artful things, you know you are!) It
is su stupid travelling in a Ladies' Carriage. Why, there is no one
to talk to, no one to save your gloves when you want to open the
door to get out, no one to look after your parcels for you! Don't let
them bully us, dear Mr. Punch. They are spiteful old things—take
my word for it. I know what women are.' 0, why did you marry?

FLOBENCE FLTBTAWAY.
DlAB MB. PrrarCH, The Shamrock, Dublin.
IT is an Irish girl now who is speaking to you. Mind that,
Sir. Why shall we have all this botheration about a miserable
Railway Carriage P Surely the gentlemen are not so bad at all, at
all. I abhor selfishness, Sir, and can't a young lady (especially an
Irish young lady) take as much care of herself as if she were just
the Lord Lieutenant himself?
No, if you must have Railway Carriages exclusively for Ladies,
why just admit the Gentlemen to them. There's a way out of the
difficulty, anyhow 1
Yours sincerely,
KATHLEEN MOLLOY.
A PRETTY KWD OF CURATE.
IN Convocation, the other day, a resolution having been moved
approving the Report of the Committee on Rubrics, and opposed by
the wiser part of their Reverences :—
"PRBBBNDABY PEBBT also opposed the Motion, as did CANON MILLBB.
The latter referred to an, occurrence reported as having happened at St. Al-
ban's, Holbom, on Sunday, when the officiating curate, pointing to the legal
vestment to which he was limited under a recent judgment, called it a
1 thing,' and refused to celebrate the Holy Communion in it."
So, on the other hand, 'some reverend young gentlemen occa-
sionally kiss the vestment they are going to put on. But we are
not sure of such clergy's gender. There have been female sailors.
May not young ladies in disguise have contrived to enter the
Church? Perhaps it was one of these, officiating at St. Alban's,
whose tongue bewrayed her :—
"And diskivered her tender sex."
And so she stood confessed as one whose proper wear was petticoats,
when, in a fit of vexation at having to wear a vestment she thought
ugly, she called it " a thing."

MAN TO MAN.
MB. PtfNClr,—The natives, not by any means to say the savages,
of the Admiralty Islands teach us how entirely to dispense with
undertakers. See the letter in the Times about them from on board
H.M.S. Challenger. They neither inter nor burn their dead. They
bury them—in themselves.
I know this practice is called "Cannibalism;" but that once
offensive word has in these days of progress become a mere de-
scriptive noun. Chemically, animal matter is animal matter. The
elements of Man do not materially differ from those of Ox, or Sheep,
or Pig.
The Admiralty Islanders eat man, although they refuse dog. But
BO enlightened a people can have no superstitious objection to dog;
they have doubtless tried dog, and found dog to be bad, whereas
they find man good.
By consigning the remains of the defunct to the interiors of the
living, these economical islanders not only incur no funeral ex-
penses, but altogether exempt themselves from the need and the
nuisance of cemeteries. They at the same time render their popula-
tion in a great measure self-sustaining. Science will in due time
teach them to utilise, in agriculture, the bones which they cannot
crunch, and as yet seem not to know what to do with.
These Anthropophagi are no common Cannibals. They eat, but
do not, unless perhaps occasionally, kill their kind. Their Canni-
balism, in fact, is next to Vegetarianism in point of gentleness.
Let us talk no more of Cannibalism. Let us call it " Comesture."
For my part, I should like to be as useful as I can to those I leave
behind me. Accordingly, I prefer Comesture to Cremation, and
account " Earth to Earth" an arrangement less philanthropic than
"Man to Man." At any rate, I had as lief be eaten as either burnt
or basketed.
However, we cannot at present in this island imitate the obsequies
of those other islanders. "It is singular that they are totally igno-
rant of the use of tobacco and spirits." Hence, their flesh is esculent,
because pure. We should disagree with one another, dead, worse
than we do, living. Before we can be Cannibals we must become
Teetotallers. Let LAWSON put that in his pipe, and smoke it, even
if he eschew tobacco.
But I have trespassed too far on your valuable space in observa-
tions less appropriate now, perhaps, than they would be in the Dead
Season. Believe me to be, in every possible respect, yours without
prejudice, VAMPIRUS GITS, Ph. D.
The Zoo.
LADIES AND BABIES.
LADIES have their will and their won't:
None their caprice disparages.
When we find the wipe among them don't
Much like Ladies' Carriages.
There Nurses travel and Babies sqtiall,
And a glance that's only cursory
Will show that it's no treat at all
To ride in a Railway Nursery.
Who cares to listen to silly stuff—
Baby-talk—in a railway carriage P
BaMes will come quite soon enough
Jf spoons should end in msrriagK
Well, spoons may end so, Latty fair!
"Tis a somewhat troublesome ending:
And you'll entertain angels unaware,
From the seventh heaven desoendiiig.
For the Baby utterly unknown
Is a noisy, troublesome creature;
Tli'iugh the Baby that's one's vt'ry own
Is a love in its every feature.
The Sex prefers the Carnage wherein
The sexes meet together;
Where a pleasant chat may oft begin
With a word about the weather.
Is there any harm in the brief romance
Of a talk with a courteous stranger?
If he offers Punch, you may see at a glance
There's not the slightest "danger.
That test is sure, my pretty waif;
Your comrade of the minute,
If he loves his Punch, is an escort safe,
For he learns good manners in it!
PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL.
ACCOHDING to the Alhenantm, "interviewing," as practised by
American Journalists, is about to assume a new shape. One of
these gentry is on the eve of publishing his experiences of inter-
views with representatives of the leading London periodicals. He
claims to have "interviewed" Mr. Punch and the Editors of " the
Daily Telegraph, Church Times, Bell's Life, Standard, Morninq
Post, Reynolds' Miscellany, Illustrated Ifcics, and the Athenaeum.1'
Mr. Punch, of ooxirse, cannot say what will be published about him
on the present occasion, but he thinks that any future interview
with an American Journalist may be safely reported as follows:—
American Journalist. Mr. Punch, as you refused me admittance
at the front door, you see I have availed myself of the chimney.
May I ask you why it is so dirty?
Mr. Punch. Certainly. I have it cleaned three times a week,
but that is scarcely sufficient to get rid of the soot caused by the
consumption daily of many tons of rejected contributions.
American Journalist. Do you possess a horsewhip, Mr. Punch?
******
Mr. Punch. I hope you will now feel that your question is
superfluous.
American Journalist. You have certainly {fiven me ample proofs,
Mr. Punch, that you do possess a horsewhip. How many feet is
your first-floor window from the street, Mr. Punch 1
Mr. Punch. Pray, Sir, go and see for yourself!

The American Journalist having gracefully retired through the
window, Mr. Punch returned to his desk.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
BIESTLY authority in
Ireland sets its face
against the Dublin
Training School for
National Teachers.
A plan has been sug-
gested for boarding-
out Roman Catholic
pupil - teachers in
houses approved by
their clergy. The
Government (Lords,
Monday, July 5),
don't tee their way
to this, and give
various reasons quite
wide of the real one,
which is no doubt an
unwillingness to of-
fend certain sections
of their supporters
by anything that
looks'** like concession to
priestly power in Ireland.
"Thus oad begins, and
worse remains behind." The
Church and the School are
at loggerheads, and School
goes to the wall.
THE DUKB OP RICHMOND
is seriously thinking of strik-
ing the "Knowingly " out of
his Adulteration Bill. The
absurdity of throwing upon
the buyer the proof that the
seller knowswhathe is selling
has proved too much even for
the oontentedness of that most contented
and Conservative public whose remon-
strances reach Richmond. There must be
at least ten miles of them!
, (Commons.) Levfe en matte of the Com-
mon Lawyers in the House, against the Con-
stitution of the Intermediate Court of Appeal, botched up by the Government to save the rest of the Judicature Act. "Hawks should
na' pike out hawks' een." The Lawyers of both bars ought to imitate the Scotch Members, and wash their legal linen in private. Their
fighting powers should be reserved fur their cases and their clients.

Let Q.C.8 fight to prove black white—
Tbeir briefs are marked thereto:
Let Counsel in the caute-listg fight—
'Xii what the; 're paid to do.
But, Lawyers, in the House ne'er let
Tour angry passions rise:
Tour brace of oars were never meant
To bar each other's rise.
"When thieves fall out," says the proverb, "honest men come by their own." If the disagreement of Lawyers involve the earn6
consequence, there should be every prospect of a satisfactory Court of Intermediate Appeal.
The Judicature Act would have reduced the Judges from eighteen to fifteen. "The Government has been convinced by the commu-
nications it has received " that it would be undesirable to lessen the number of judicial nests for the callow brood iu bombazine and
horsehair who aspire to those calm retreats, built high above the disturbance of political winds, and the catastrophes of parties. So
"Hu«h-a-bye, Q.C., upon the tree-top!
Ai the Judges are now so the Judges shall stop!"
The Judicial Committee of Privy Council is not to be starved to furnish forth the new Court of Appeal. That, at least, seems a
change for the better. The rules and orders to be made by the Judges under the new Act are not to overrule Common or Statute Law (so
likely they would!); but are to be confined to "pleading, practice, and procedure."
Lords (Tuesday).—Public Health Bill (300 clauses) passed through Committee in a jiffey. Punch feels he cannot too much commend
the wisdom of their Lordships. Take example, ye contentious Commons! That is the way to deal with a Consolidation Bill. If
you would imitate the wisdom of your betters—it would be a shame to call them your Peers—every branch of the Law which has got
into Statutory Chaos—and what branch has not ?—might have its Chaos reduced to Order by Consolidation preparatory to real amend-
ment only possible when the want to be supplied, or the blunder to be rectified, is clear to the meaner capacities of common lay minds.
Of Statute Law, unlike liquids, it may be said it never is clear until consolidated.
(Commons.) Civil Service Estimates. MB. GOIIST tried to get rid of the examiners of criminal accounts, who have occasionally made
the Treasury odious by penny-wisdom leading to miscarriage of justice.
It is to be hoped that this kind of penny-wisdom, in so serious a matter as the conduct of criminal prosecutions, will henceforth be as
systematically snubbed as there is reabon to fear it has, at times, been systematically encouraged (in common with much other penny-
wisdom) at the Treasury.
An hour was devoted to the grievances of THOMAS DUFFY, ex-canteen keeper at the Curragh, turned out by the War Office for
Ailing drink to the military at illegal hours. Who dares say the House of Commons is not the Grand (and petty) Inquest of the
Nation? Mighty enough to measure the designs of Russia, it is not too great to weigh the grievances of DUFFY!
What followed (on MB. BAILLIE CODEBASE'S speech, calling attention to the progress of Russia in Central Asia), in these days
of military manoeuvres, Punch takes the liberty of condensing into a brief dialogue in the camp and barrack style:—
English Sentry (to Huts Outpost, moving towards Affghanittan). Qui va la?
Jtuss Outpost. Friend!
English Sentry (after looking to Foreign Office and India Office for instructions, and getting none). Pass. Friend—
SirG. Campbell. And all 'swell!

"AH I THOUGH I UATIT'T BB A BUTLBR, I 'AVB THE Fsujy's OF ONE!"
Or, if our readers prefer x-Euopian to military apologue, here it is in that way:—
"A Russian setter was drawing cautiously towards an Affghan He-rat. A British
bull-dog, on the other side of the Hindoo Eoosh, lay watching his approaches. 'What shall
I do?' he growled at last, looking to his masters.
"'Bark,'said one.
i * i
"'Bite,' said another.
"' Lie still in the sun, and do nothing,' said a third.
"The bull-dog's tail quivered—he snarled uneasily, wrinkling his muzzle as if he longed
to show his teeth; but, finally, accustomed to wait for the word of command, and not
receiving it, laid his heavy head on his fore-paws, and resumed his attitude of unquiet
observation.
"Moral.—Activity is not always suocessf ul; inactivity may sometimes be masterly. Both
are to be judged by the issue. But the most masterly inactivity cannot err in keeping its

MB. WHALLEY, attempting to fix the meet for a Grand Jesuit Hunt, was cruelly Counted
Out before the smallest of the small hours!
Wednesday.—Was given to MB. TBEVTXYAIT'S Household Franchise (Counties) Bill.
Mr. Bright supported it by a petition from sixty thousand members and friends of the
Agricultural Labourers' Union. A vote for every householder in county, as in town, say
these petitioners, is the keystone of the Arch.
Clearly the time must come, whether the Commons like it or not. But, as clearly, the
time is not yet.
The House will some day have to face its dose of County, as it has drained its draught of
Borough, residuum. But both the Country and the Commons know that the decoction is
likelier to damage than strengthen the Constitution, unless the physic is very carefully
re-distributed.
This is the sum and substance of the MABQOTS or HABTINGTOII'S reason for refraining
from voting. If the House had been as free to follow its judgment as the Leader of Her
Majesty's Opposition, it would have done as he did. As it was, it rejected the Bill by
268 to 166.
Thursday (Lords).—The Friendly Societies Bill (boneless, so no wonder the House makes
no bones of it) passed Second Reading with
a protest from LORD ABERDARE and LORD
MOBLEY against the farce of a mock audit,
and the want of a real one.
(Commons.) REYNOLDS painted GABBICK
between Tragedy and Comedy. Why were
not Thursday's anti-Papal interpellations
in time for Punch to paint his pendant of
'' DISBAELI between WADDT and WHAXLEY"
—WADDT wants to know whether the Go-
vernment means to protect the Bench and
the Public Offices from the POPE. "Just
let the POPE put his finger in our pie,"
says MB. DISHAKM, "and we will take it
into serious consideration."
WHAILEY wants to know what more
information Government requires as to
Jesuit designs than CARDINAL MANNING'S
declaration that their mission is to put
England's imperial power under the Papal
toe?
MR. DISBAELI said if he wanted any in-
formation he knew where to go for it.
Very neat. But query the taste, or use,
of BO snubbing the irrepressible?
The PREMIER submitted to the country
the PRINCE OF WALES'S India Bill—a very
moderate one—under £150,000 in all:
£52,000 for the voyage put and home;
£30,000 for rites of hospitality in India,
to come out of India's pocket (a pity); and
£60,000 personal expenses.
Is this enough to do the thing hand-
somely? Better not do it at all than do
it shabbily. You can't ask twice. MAC-
DONAID, PETBB TAYLOR, and BUBT declared
snoh votes provoked more disloyalty among
Working-men than all the agents of Re-
publicanism. Do England's Working-men
speak through these three mouths P
We should be sorry to believe it, for the
sake of the Working-men. If it be true,
nothing can better show that our masters
still want teaching.
MB. HAITBUBY hoped we were doing our
duty—that is, our best—for the suppression
of the East African Slave-trade. MR.
BOUBKE declared we were, and described
what this doing amounted to. MB. FOBSTEB
thought our action satisfactory; and Mr.
Punch is content to follow MB. FOBSTEB'S
lead in this matter, into which MB. FORSTER
throws a hereditary heart.

MR. E. J. REED would not sit there and
hear big iron ships—his children par excel-
lence—run down in this brassy manner.
MR. GOSCHEN didn't see why we should
not have a few big ships, if only we had
a good many small ones.
"Just my idea! " said MB. WARD-HUNT.
"Great and small make up a wall." The

THE ROMANESQUE REVIVAL.
HAVING been obliged, by the decision of the Court of Arches, to put out
their lights and put off their motley, the clerical performers of St. Alban's,
Holborn, on Sunday last, proceeded only half-way with their usual imitation.
It terminated, according to the Post, with a short discourse, preached by the
REV. J. STANTON. After that, the audience went to attend the conclusion of
their Sunday's entertainment at another place:—
';The whole congregation, numbering several hundred persons, the great majority of
•whom were females, then proceeded through Holbom, over the Viaduct, and by Newgate
Street and Cheapside, to the Church of St. Vedast, Foster Lane."
The Bisnor OF LONDON has issued au inhibition forbidding the St. Alban's
Clergy to preach in any Church but their own. Instead, therefore, of the
Reverend Gentleman above-named, who had been expected to till the pulpit—
"In the Church of St. Vedast the sermon was preached by the Sector, who said there
had never been a revival of religion which had not its confessors, and the revival of these
latter days must, he supposed, have its confessors, if not its martyra."
The revival of religion is one thing; the "revival of these latter days" is
another. This revival—the Ritualist dramatic, musical, and spectacular
burlesque—the BISHOP OP LONDON is trying to suppress—it being out of the
jurisdiction of the LOBD CHAMBERLAIN. At some Houses—apparently at St.
Vedast's—it is given out for repetition till farther notice; indeed, in spite of
episcopal notice—the part not only of Confessor, but also of Father Confessor,
by Anglican Divines. It is quite certain that they will not, any of them, be
called upon to play the Martyr, and not at all likely that, if they were, a
single one of them would undertake that arduous character. Ritualist mimes
may be ridiculed, but will not be roasted.
The St. Vedast's and St. Alban's Revivalists have no connection whatever
with MOODY AND SANKEY. Except that of rivalry.

May wrangle over gauds and toys,
Fuming whene'er some scrap of flummery

May vent on LUTHER, or on TAIT,

Much like an angry housemaid, chidden
For finery that is forbidden;
Who strikes an attitude as martyr
Because her Sunday rig's not smarter.—
Is this the Church you mean? If so,
JOHN'S Answer is a ready " No .'"
Is it a "scene " where cleric pride
May be supremely glorified;
And every pretty priestling hope
To play the part of petty Pope,—
Shining in foolish virgins' eyes,
With sacerdotal sanctities;
And gently dazzling, now and then,
Some mooney and molluscous men;
Where, gaily decked in stolen plumes,
'Midst pompous rites and fragrant fumes,
The emptiest daw may masque and mum
Ecclesiastic Fe-Faw-Fum?
Is this poor thing your " Church"? If so
JOHN'S-Answer's an explosive—" -Vo.'"
Is it a word of Life, or Death?
A Sacerdotal Shibboleth?
A proud abstraction vague and vast
Veiling the tyranny of Caste?
A verbal Fetish, shaped to rule
The flexile fancy of the fool?
A web of forms, traditions, creeds,
Stretched 'twixt the soul and the soul's needs?

(By Our Own Special Reporter.)
PROVINCE OF CANTERBURY.
UPPER HOUSE.
THE only business their Lordships transacted was a discussion on
the Report of a Committee appointed to draw up a Special Form of
Service for the Use of Missionaries in Foreign Countries. The
question before their Lordships was, whether it would not be a more
advisable and expeditious course to employ the excised Services of
the English Church; for, though thera was no further necessity for
them in this country, they might be of great spiritual advantage to the
various Natives in the process of conversion.
The BISHOP OF BUNOAY observed, that, for example, the service
for Saint Charles's Day—he meant for CHARLES THE FIRST'S Day—
was really doing nothing now, and might be easily adapted for
Missionary enterprise, omitting t he political allusions.
The BISHOP OF BULLOCK-SMITHY asked what would be substi-
tuted for these allusions P For his part he was for retaining the
Service intact. It would be of the greatest benefit to both the
Missionaries and their native converts, as it would give them some
insight into English history, and so advance the interests of Chris-
tianity on the one hand, and of civilisation on the other.
His Grace the PRESIDENT referred to the clock, and took that
opportunity of observing that he mast now adjourn the debate,
having faithfully promised his wife to return to the Palace early, as
she had a large garden-party that afternoon, where he hoped all
their Lordships would be able to attend.
It was accordingly agreed to postpone the discussion till another
day. Their Lordships then adjourned.
LOWER HOUSE.
The Prolocutor took the chair at eleven o'clock.
A number of petitions and graoaminn were handed in.
The Ritual Debate.
CANON WEDOEND proposed the following Motion:—
"That the meaning of tho Ornaments Rubric of EDWARD THE SIXTH bein?
uncertain, thie House recommends that it shall suffice for tlie Minister to
wear a surplice only, and nothing else, or a surplice and a scarf, or a surplice
and a ncarf and a stole, and th» h".«l of his degree, if he has one; and to
these might be added anything else at the wish of the congregation, and with
the sanction of the Bishop of the diocese."
The Canon observed that he thought this would place matters on a
basis mutually agreeable to all parties. (Applause.)
ARCHDEACON BOULDER failed to see why the Bishop of the diocese
should be brought in at all. Bishops only muddled matters, and they
could get on much better without their interference. (Applause.)
The ARCHDEACON OP WYSEBOHOUGH expressed his firm conviction
that something must be done in the present crisis.
The ARCHDEACON or ADDLEPATE agreed with the last speaker.
CANON DRYLY proposed that there should be only one vestment
for everybody—a Cope. The Cope was originally a pluviale, or
Roman waterproof. ("Sear, hear!") It was warm in winter,
and airy in summer, and it had no mare doctrinal signification than
his own mackintosh. It was wise policy to provide for a coming
storm.
PREBENDARY NOODEL reminded the last speaker that they were
discussing "Ornaments," not "Vestments." Vestments were
illegal; Ornaments were not. The question was, what were
Ornaments? This was evidently a matter of individual taste.
CANON SYDB-SPLYTTEK said they were discussing what he would
take the liberty to call the "Vested interests" of the Church.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
(Laughter.) For his part, he never could see why anything should
mean anything. (Laughter.) He was prepared to Cope with the
difficulty. (Laughter.) He did not see why a Clergyman should
want to dress himself up as a groom of the Stole (laughter), but it
struck him that this House was just going to shut the door care-
fully after the horse had been stolen. (Great laughter.) If some
ffisthetioally-mi&ded among his clerical brethren liked to give
everything a symbolical meaning, he, personally, had no objection.
A spade with hi™ meant a spade, and there was an end of the
matter. (Laughter.)
DB. SMOOTH agreed with all the preceding speakers. If his own
congregation wished him to wear a Cope, he would do so; if not, he
would not. As long as we did our duty quietly and unostentatiously
it really seemed to him of no importance in what dress that duty
was done. (" No, no ! ") He was sorry to hear that some in that
House appeared to differ from him. He could assure them that his
motto was to live and let live, and to lire 'peaceably with all men.
(Applause.)
The REV. MABTIK CALVES wanted to know if the House wished to
restore Popery with all its rags and mummeries. (" Order.'")
Yes, he repeated " mummeries." He had only once, thank Heaven,
been inside a Romish Church, but that was quite enough for him.
{" Oh, oh ! ") He looked upon the present movement as Jesuitical.
?l Cope " rhymed with "Pope." If they wanted " Ornaments" of
the Church, CBANMBB (" Oh, oh!"), RIDLEY, LATOCEB, HOOKER,
HENBT, and SIMEON, were sufficient ornaments for any Protestant
Church. He did not want to return to Babylonish captivity, or
bow the knee to Baal. (" Oh, oh ! ")
PBBBENDABY MIDWAY deprecated the tone of the last speaker
(" Sear, hear ! "), while at the same time he admired his energy,
his zeal, and his fidelity to what he considered his duty ("Star,
hear ! ") in the truly liberal and widely comprehensive Church to
which they had the signal happiness to belong. (Applause.) He
approved of the scope of CANON WEDGEITD'S Motion, but should like
to add as a rider that,—
"Whatever Ornaments or Vestments might hereafter be adopted, they
might or might not be considered as baring any doctrinal signification,
according to the bias and taste of each individual."
For his part, he was'prepared to wear anything, or everything. His
congregation had given nim Scarves, Stoles. Copes, ana Chasubles,
and he wore them indiscriminately, consulting the tastes of the
donors. A minority of his congregation wished for the black gown
only, and so he gave them a special black-gown service every
Sunday. He was sure that, with a little mutual concession—one
giving up a doctrine here, an opinion there, and another a vesture,
an ornament, and so forth—we should all get on together, and enjoy
the blessings of peace, unity, and concord. (Applause.)
ABCHDEACON DOWNBIGHT said, either Vestments were right, or
they were wrong. (Great applause.) If right, let us have them.
(Applause.) If wrong, let us not have them. (Applause.) That was all.
CANON BUBLKIGH said he was past sixty, and didn't want to
change his old lamps for new ones. He had been all his life
accustomed to a decent worship in his own parish Church, and to
the beautifully impressive form used in our ancient Cathedrals.
(" Hear, hear.'") He now came up to London, and. on his word
and honour, on entering one of these new-fangled Churches last
Sunday, he absolutely thought that he had got into a Roman
Catholic place of worship by mistake. (Laughter.) It was no sub-
ject for laughter. He went to join in their common worship, as
ordered by the Prayer Book, and ne positively was totally unable to
understand anything that was going on. He protested against any
innovation as most dangerous to both Church and State, and
sincerely trusted that what had been good enough for such men as
HOOKEB, WILSON, and JEREMY TAYLOB, our fathers and grand-
fathers, might remain in statu quo.
The RET. THOMAS THDBIFEB said he wished to see the symbolic
beauty of the old services restored according, for instance, to the use
of Sarum, without raising any doctrinal difficulties. Let Effect come
first, and it would be then time enough to inquire into Cause.
The DEAN OF BHOAD SANCTUABY would not stop to ask what was
the use of Sarum. or what was the use of Convocation. (" Question ! ")
In fact, he would not waste his time in addressing such a set of
incapables as he saw around him. (" Order.'") The Resolution and
Amendments were simply puerile, and the only crumb of consolation
was that they were worthless. The aim of most of the speakers
reminded him of Mrs. Nickleby's proposal on a trying occasion,
when that muddle-headed but kind-hearted lady suggested that
"some fair arrangement might be come to with a pudding twice a
week or a dumpling which should be very satisfactory and pleasant
for all parties." ""Which compromise," the Novelist adds, "not
exactly meeting the point at issue, nobody took any notice of it."
[The Dean then abruptly quitted the House.]
CANON SOFTLY then proposed an Amendment, and a rider, that the
words "until otherwise advised" be inserted after "recommends,"
and the words " and nothing else" and " if he has one," be omitted.
The Resolution, thus amended, was carried with the following
rider, that,—
"This House does not hereby give any sanction to any doctrine contrary
to what may be ascertained by proper authority in the Prayer Book and
Articles; and, further, this House does not intend hereby to pronounce That
doctrine is BO contained, nor, further, to decide what constitutes the proper
authority in such matters."
The Members then heartily congratulated one another on their
success, and the Prolocutor pronounced the Benediction.
The House then adjourned.

THE BATTLE OF BAYSWATER.
Ult Special Corre-

Seat of War
telegraphs from
the scene of the
Summer Ma-
noeuvres of
1875.
9 A..X. — The
engagement is
about to com-
mence. The con-
tending forces are
divided into two
parties. The
Head of the
Family (for this
occasion only),
MB. SMITH, re-
presenting the
Enemy, and the
remainder of the
Household Bri-
gade (MBS. SMITH
and the Children)
representing the
Home Forces. It
is laid that, be-
fore muster at
breakfast, the Commander of the Home Forces (MBS. SMITH) gave
the Enemy a "rough idea" of the scheme of operation!. It is
supposed that the Infantry require change of air at the sea-side, and
that the Enemy is determined upon preventing any march from
London.
10 A.M.—The two Forces are drawn up in line in the Breakfast-
Room. The Household Brigade have commenced the attack, by
throwing out skirmishers (furnished by the Infantry), with the
purpose of discovering the intentions of the Enemy. The Head of
the Family, much harassed by these attacks, has taken refuge
behind the Times newspaper.
11 A.K.—The flank of the Enemy's barricade has been turned by
the Infantry, strongly supported by the Commander of the Home
Forces.
12 NOON.—The Enemy has taken up a strong position in the
Study. His arm-chair entrenchment is being forced by the Com-
mander of the Home Forces, at the head of a company of White-
washers.
1 P.M.—The Enemy has evacuated the Study, which is now
occupied by the Whitewashes.
2 P.M.—The Enemy is preparing to make a last stand in the
Dressing Room. He has locked and bolted the doors, and is known
to be in possession of much ammunition, in the shape of pens, ink,
and paper. The Infantry are engaged on out-post duty on the
staircase. The Commander of the Home Forces is waiting for
intelligence in the Boudoir.
3 P.M.—The Euemy has been starved out. He has just left the
Dressing-Room to make a reconnaissance in the neighbourhood of
the Kitchen.
4 P.M.—After an anxious invest! gation, the Commissariat Depart-
ment has been proved to have broken down. The Enemy has just
received a report from the Cook, informing him that "there is
nothing in the house."
5 P.M.—The Enemy has just returned to the Dressing-Room, to
find it in the hands of the Home Forces. During the Enemy's
foraging expedition an opportunity has been seized to take up the
carpet and dismantle the windows. The Enemy's ammunition has
been captured, and the Dressing-Room is quite unfit for occupa-
tion.
6 P.M.—The Enemy has retreated into the Dressing-Room, where
he has been hotly pursued by the Home Forces. Charges are being
made with great loss of temper on both sides.

of a Reserve Brigade (Mit. SMITH'S mother-in-law), and a severe
engagement is imminent.
8 P.M.—One of the Umpire Staff (a bachelor friend) has arrived,
and has directed the Enemy to retire to the Club.
0 P.M.—Recommencement of hostilities. Demonstration of the
Commander of the Home Forces strongly supported by the Reserve.
Feints, volleys, tears, and grand attack upon the better feelings of
the Enemy.
9'30 P.M.—The Enemy is wavering. The last attack of the Home
Furces is expected to prove successful.
10 P.M.—Arrival of the Umpire-in-Chief (the Doctor), who, after
carefully inspecting the present condition of the Forces of the oon-
'f nding parties, orders the Enemy to retire immediately to Dieppe—
the march to commence on the morrow. Triumph of the Commander
of the Home Forces.
10'15 P.M.—The Commander of the Home Forces, after declaring
peace, has resumed the supreme command. The order to "cease
firing" (at first resisted by the Reserve) is now being obeyed on all
hides. The Commissariat of the Household Brigade is in magnificent
condition. Supplies good and ample.
10'30 P.M.—Commanding Officer's call to supper. End of engage-

PUNCH AT WIMBLEDON.
F course, as all the world
knows, Mr. Punch looks
remarkably well in any and
every costume it may please
his fancy to assume; but
when Mr. Punch wishes to
appear to special advan-
tage, he dons his Volunteer
uniform. As it would cause
great and natural heart-
burning were the name of
the happy Corps of which
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL
PUNCH is the Commanding
Officer to be divulged, the
number of his Regiment
shall be carefully concealed.
It is enough to say that his
uniform, like many other
Volunteer uniforms, is
rather ornamental than
useful. The sleeves of his
tunic are covered with the
handsomest silver lace—
lace which glistens in the
sun when there is a sun, and which tarnishes in the rain when the
timid civilian unfurls his umbrella. He wears, as a Field Officer, a
perfectly useless sabretasoh, for the very excellent reason that he has
received orders from the Horse Guards to add it to the long list of
his accoutrements. On his head he balances a heavy shako, that
those who regard him may admire his powers of endurance. His
sword is of the regulation length, his high hoots are of the regula-
tion tightness, and his spurs are after the regulation pattern.
Mounted on his charger, with his holsters containing pocket-pistols
loaded to the mouth with Brown Sherry, and his_ pouch-belt fnll of
the best cigars, he is a man that Mars himself might admire. Nay,
more—not only Mars but daughters also.
As Mr. Punch has never missed putting in an annual appearance
at Wimbledon, it was not to be expected for a moment that he
would neglect to do his duty in July, 1875. Accordingly, on Mon-
day last he presented himself amongst the first of those who claimed
the attention of the clerk at the Waterloo Station, and in due time
received the necessary voucher franking him to the Camp from the
hands of a bowing official. Conscious of the fact that a soldier
should always appear "smart" on parade, he refused to enter a
smoking carriage. Ladies are charming creatures, but opening
doors for them is not an exercise calculated to improve the appear-
ance of regulation buck-skin gloves. A hint to the Guard secured
for him a compartment all to himself. It was evidently intended
for the use of elderly Generals, as it bore a label suggesting that it
was appropriated to the service of aged females. Then in perfect
privacy Mr. Punch opened the magic volume that is his greatest
solace in times of intense sleeplessness, and began to peruse "Sec-
tion 10.—Gymnastic Training.—III. Course for Drilled Soldiers."
Having nearly mastered the secrets of the Horse Guards, he found
himself, rather suddenly, outside the Station at Wimbledon. A
General, of rather genial appearance, had evidently been anticipating
his arrival with impatience.

"Ah, here you are at last!" cried the General, inviting Mr.
Punch to mount a gaily caparisoned charger.
"Morning, your R.H.," said the man of men, gracefully
flinging himself into the saddle. "What is the matter?"
"The matter, indeed! Why, Sir, how do you think we can get
to work until you have inspected us P"
"How, indeed!" echoed Mr. Punch. "How are you getting
on P"
"Oh, pretty well! I think the regulations you issued last week
will be tolerably well observed. I hear that wide-awakes are not to
be worn this year on duty, and sentries will mount guard without
umbrellas."
"Come," said Mr. Punch, cheerfully; "that's a great improve-
ment," and the two great men cantered away to the Camp. There
was the usual demonstration. The guard turned out, the bugles
sounded, and the cheers were deafening.
"Sorry I am obliged to leave you," said the genial General,
sorrowfully. "But the fact is, I have a great deal to do just now.
I am President of the Association, don't you know, and then I have
to look after the Summer Manoeuvres over yonder. Ah! I wish you,
were at the head of the Control."
"Well," said Mr. Punch, modestly. "I think I could help you a
little. It shouldn't be such a very difficult matter to feed 10,000
men seventeen miles from Aldershott."
"You have heard of that Mess!"
"It seems to me (to make an old joke) that there wag no Mess at
all," and Mr. Punch laughed, pleasantly.
"Don't say anything more about it, said the genial General,
anxiously. "Take a cigar P"
"Never smoke in uniform, your R.H." replied Mr. Punch.
"Besides it is your last—not that that matters much! If what
somebody says is true—there must be plenty of weeds at Alder-
shott!""
The genial General shook his head, and slowly rode away.
Thus the two Generals parted—the Man of the Sword to umpire-
in-chief at Aldershott. The Man of the Pen to inspect the Volun-
teers.
"And so," pondered the pensive Punch, "the Riflemen are
smarter this year. They no longer contrive uniforms of peculiar
construction. They no longer combine the stern majesty of the
military tunic with the graceful outlines of the alpaca umbrella."
And -Vr. Punch was well pleased. The greatest warrior of the age
(amiably dispensing with the chairing that certain enthusiastic
votaries of Mars would have forced upon him) wandered slowly
through the tented field.
"Ah, the old, old form," murmured Mr. Punch mournfully, as
he neared a well-remembered group—a group he had seen in years
one by, a group he will see again, if Ridicule is powerless, and
Daughter is in vain. "Every inch a soldier, except a foot of hat 1"
commented Mr. Punch sorrowfully, as the figure of a stalwart Scot,

clothed in the garb of old Gael, plus a " chimney-pot" (according to
the regulations laid down by that most eminent firm of cap-con-
trivers, MESSBS. LINCOLN AND BENNETT, came into view. Yes,
and every foot a civilian, except a few inches ef shako!" he added,
as he noticed that a gentleman -wearing what appeared to be "The
Tourist suit as advertised," had donned for the nonce a distinctly
military head-dress. "And yet they say that our Volunteers have
no notion of discipline and smartness!" and he sighed heavily as he
hurried away from a picture which was at once painful and exces-
sively absurd.
"Let me get me to the shooting," he said more cheerfully.
"Well, my man," said he, on his arrival at the targets, to the

marker, '' and how ate we getting on, eh? Outers all right? Ricochets in fine
condition? Surely that touched the target?"
"No, Sorr," replied the intel-
ligent official—an Irish boy,
by the way—"the larst hit,
Sorr, was a miss, Sorr!"
"Indeed," murmured [Mr.
Punch, "from the sound I
should have taken it for a
^mmm^ m rrr^MSsO^ tto'^utoSS'rf'iS'^LS
conceit, the Commander - in-
Chief wandered to another part
of the ground. The tents were
regularly pitched, and their
occupants seemed to be in good
spirits, and hard at work.
Altogether, Mr. Punch was
well satisfied with what he
saw, and made up his mind to
write a favourable report of the
Camp and its belongings.
Again he approached the shoot-
ing grounds of the happy Rifle-
men, and listened to the sweet
music of many bands as the
sounds floated past him, borne
to the targets on the zephyr
wings of summer breezes. It
may be seen from the construc-
tion of the above sentence that
he was rapidly becoming
poetical, when he was sternly recalled to prose by the following dialogue—
fi" Sergeant," whispered a timid voice, have you »een my Missis about?"
"Seen 'em!" thundered the Sergeant—the poor man was tired and out of


temper—" Seen 'em! I believe yer! High, low, right and left, and all over
the place!"
"Ah," murmured Mr. Punch, thinking of the fair sex,
but not exactly of his "Missis," "why do'not the Ladies
make Wimbledon one of their rights! How nice it would
be if this Camp were occupied by Amazons."
He had scarcely uttered the words when silvery tones
sounded in his enchanted ears. He listened, looked, and
lo! the prettiest of shakos upon the glossiest of chignons—
(See in margin a thumb-nail sketch of the effect).
Cautiously advancing in the wake of this lovely vision,
his progress was arrested by a female sentinel—with the
prettiest voice—softly whispering, "Who goes there?"
"A friend!" replied Mr. Punch, enthusiastically.
1 But what do you do here, my dear Madam?"
"Is this not the very place for us, Mr. Punch f" an-
swered the Sentinel, smiling. "Is not Wimbledon in
July the Head Quarters of Flirtation?"
Mr. Punch was perfectly charmed. For a few minutes
he could not utter a word. On every side he found proofs
of female taste. Even the ammunition brown paper had
been converted into bonnet peaks.
"Ah, TENNYSON !" he exclaimed.' [" You are at last outdone. You thought

of a College of Women, but I have discovered a Camp of
Girls."
"Not all girls, Mr. Punch !" said a stern voice, and
to his horror the Great Creature found himself con-
fronted by his better half, wearing the costume of a
Major-General. "I will teach you to flirt, Sir."
"My dear," mildly replied the luckless lone, "I do
not require teaching."
"Let him be tried by Court-Martial," and in a mo-
ment Mr. Punch was roughly seized by the collar.
*****
"Tickets, please Sir!" Mr. Punch woke to find him-
self certainly at Wimbledon, but still with a copy of
"The Queen's Regulations " lying open on the cushion
beside him.
And this was Mr. Punch's dream of Wimbledon,
suggested by memories of the past—he may, perhaps,
have something to say about the present of Wimbledon
—in the future.
A STOCKBROKER'S SOLILOQUY.
Do you remember, 0 MATILDA sweet!
When steaks and you began to get so dear,
How everybody thought it very queer
If Man and Wife got bread and cheese to eat,
And now and then a modest pint of beer,
Upon that hum-drum sum, three hundred pounds a-year?
And yet we both were brave enough to marry,
And of "inoumbranoes" disdained the fear.
Now we have eight: their little boots appear
Enough to make me wish them at Old Harry,
For everything is twenty times as dear,
And I, as yet, but make three thousand pounds a-year!
A precious lot of tin it takes to gild a
Life such as ours. Yquem suoceedeth beer:
For your old Exmooryou 've to drop a tear,
And drive a pair of dark brown cobs, Matilda!
Happily, on the Stock Exchange, my dear,
'Tis but a step from three to thirty thou. a year.
Make money, somehow! 'Twas my father's fancy:
I 've an hereditary taint, that's clear;
And without coin should feel uncommon queer:
Wherefore I practise City necromancy,
Kill many clients (names do not appear),
In hope to fairly earn my thirty thou. a year.
And when I 've got a snug estate in Kent
Or Surrey (London should be somewhere near,
For country life is rather tame, I fear),
Reposing calmly on my cent, per cent.,
Sipping my port, I '11 say, MATILDA dear!
Did we once live upon three hundred pounds a year?"
A City Chair (of Ease).
THE Gotham Committee will shortly proceed to the
election of a Professor of Rhetoric. Respectable medi-
ocrity is essential, but no special qualifications are requi-
site. Testimonials, however numerous and weighty, are
of little value, and will probably not be read. No great
power of voice is required, as the previous exertions
of the Committee have been successful in limiting the
audiences to about six persons. Preference will be given
to any one connected with a great City company, or the
prottgf of an elector.
"What's in a Name?"
AT the Suffolk Agricultural Show held at Stowmarket

which took the DUIE OF HAMILTON'S prize as the best

descent from Disturbance and Bombast!
SHADOWS OF DARKNESS.
BISHOPS and others very commonly talk of " shades of
thought in the Church." Respecting the dogma symbol-
ised by Ritualist practices, these shades of so-called
thought appear to the rational mind's eye shades of non-
sense.

OSTENSIBLE OCCUPATIONS OP JESUITS.
MB. PUNCH, anxious to partially quench MR. WHALLEY'S insatiable
thirst for useless knowledge, takes leave to offer him the informa-
tion which the House of Commons cruelly denied him. Mr. Punch,
always generous, goes beyond what the Honourable Member asks,
and furnishes him with infallible marks by which to distinguish a
Jesuit.
Ministers and Ex-Ministers.—It is sad to think that there are
many Jesuits in this small class—perhaps there are few exceptions.
A pamphlet against the Vatican, a novel whose princely hero is
surrounded by Ttfonsignore, a work on Foreign Exchange {the hidden
meaning of which phrase is a change to a foreign religion), a Plea
for National Holidays, an article in the Contemporary Review,
are unfailing marks of Jesuitry.
Members of both Houses.—Too, too many. Their ostensible occu-
pation, which nobody imagines their real one, is to make laws for
England. Any Peer who plays Polo is a Jesuit. Any Peer who
•writes books of travel is a Jesuit. Any M.P. who mentions
the Pope, in praise or dispraise, is a Jesuit. Any M.P. who never
mentions the Pope is the greatest Jesuit of all.
Novelists.—The author of Never too Late to Mend is a Jesuit,
because Jesuits can never be mended. The author of Can we For-
give Her? is a Jesuit, since they never forgive anybody. The author
of Cometh up as a Flower is a Jesuit, for they come up like weeds.
The author of Stoeet and Twenty is a Jesuit, since there are more
than twenty of them—by no means sweet. The author of Three
Feathers is a Jesuit, because the title of his book has a mystical
significance.
Suftopi and Clergy.—It is clear that a full catalogue would, in
this case, be impossible. No one, perhaps, could supply it bat the
DEAN or WESTMINSTER, Honorary Clerical Secretary to the Jesuits
of England. But any Clergyman who preaches in a gown, or a
surplice, or an alb, or a cope, or a white necktie, or black gloves, or
Oxford shoes, or a hunting coat, or cricketing flannels, is assuredly
a Jesuit.
As it is impossible to squeeze a Jesuit Directory into one number
of Punch, it may be well to conclude by warning MR. WHALLEY
that a Jesuit in the family is very dangerous. He should carefully
watch the behaviour of his servants on Fridays and fast-days. Any
cook who on those days spoils his dinner for the good of his soul,
any groom who keeps his horses without oats, any valet who gives
him a damp shirt, any maid-servant who declines to see a follower,
should be turned out of the house at once. Jesuits, depend upon it.
But is not Mr. Punch carrying owls to Athens, or coals to New-
castle P Though descended from a WHAIXBY, who was first cousin
to JOHN HAMPDEN and OLIVEK CRO.MWEI.L, is not the junior Member
of Peterborough
FATHER SUPERIOR OF THE JESUITS OF ENSLAND?

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

£P^
LL relations are, more or less, trou-
blesome. But of all troublesome
relations give us Cousins German
—(so argued my LOBD PEMZAHCE,
Lords, Monday, July 12)—if they
are to be allowed to lay down the
new principle of international obli-
gation, that every State is bound
to frame laws for preserving not
only its own internal peace, but the
internal peace of all its neighbours.
LOBD DEBBT hardly thinks COUNT
PEBPONCHF.B means to go as far as
this; but admits it is not easy to
say how far he does go. "For one foreign Court
to call upon another, under menaces, to silence its
press and public-speaking, was an act which had
excited, and he hoped would always excite, the
strongest feeling of sympathy and indignation in
this country."
Punch is glad to say ditto—as emphatically as
possible—to LORD DEBBT.
(Commons.) In a fearful fog over the Employers
and Workmen, and the Conspiracy and Protection
of Property, Bills. The longer the House groped
about, the thicker the fog seemed to grow. We
fear it is not yet cleared oft. (See Friday's Essence.)
Tuesday (Lords).—In answer to LORD WAVE-
NET'S contemptuous description of the Aldershot operations as " not manoeuvres,
but field-days," LOBD CADOGAN. for Government, sung very small, pleading cost
of forage, difficulty of getting land, Ac., &o., in extenuation of the very petty
proportions of this year's sham-warfare.
The DUKE OF CAMBBIDOE, though far too well-disciplined to let out loud,
showed clearly enough what he thought of the value of operations on a large
scale, and of the sufficiency of the War Office reasons for shirking them this year.
Finally, LOBD CAKDWELL had the calm and congenial satisfaction of posing
as Mars of Autumn Manoeuvres, and doing the magnanimous over the military
muddling of the Government.
(Commons.) MB. CBOSS confirmed the incredible story of the Spalding
Shallows' sentence of a little girl to fourteen days' in prison and four years in
a Reformatory, for plucking a geranium-leaf! He had released the girl, and rebuked the Shallows
—one of them a " Reverend," to mend the matter. (The Reverend Gentleman has since explained,
V\ \^A-S ^ appropriately enough, at an Odd Fellows'dinner. He wanted to play Providence. The Reformatory
was not
much
MB. SUT.LIVAN wants a Science and Art Department
hot Cole of its own, too, Ma. SULLIVAN? Surely, there are combustibles enough in Ireland already.) SIB STAFFOBD promised that
Government would see what could be done. Ireland—to judge by what she has done, unaided—would surely pay, and pay well, for
Art-teaching, in results, if not in money. Whatever she has not, Sister Cinderella has a taste.
Ma. P. A. TAYLOR wants the publication of the annual returns of crime and punishment in the Navy resumed. The Admiralty object
that the return, unexplained, is injurious to discipline, and exposes officers to misconstruction. Is there not a return published of
punishments in the Army?
MB. WHALLET moved for a Select Committee for his great Jesuit Hunt.
"ITe moved, but nothing followed—the dead air
Was mute and motionless."
No one either seconded or opposed him, and so the matter—commissione infecld—dropped. What was the Doctor about? WHALLET is
doubtless great, but is there no BIGOAB?
Wednesday (Commons).—Two " Previous Questions" and an Adjournment.
MB. HETOATE wants cumulative voting in Election of Aldermen by Town-Councillors. Very good as far as it goes. But why not
in Elections of Town-Councillors? Opinion on cumulative voting generally wants ripening.
SIR C. DILKE moved a Bill to enforce the Allotment Acts—the last dating from 1873. Doubtful if the Bills, as they are, do not pro-
vide sufficient coercive machinery; and, besides, there has not been time to test the working of the last Act.
Adjournment of debate on MR. M'CABTHT'S Motion to turn the Irish Public Works Commissioners into Reclaimers of Waste Lands,
for selling or letting. Ye gods, and loaves and fishes! what a gigantic vista of land-jobbery—
, "Heights piled on heights, and depths in depths withdrawn "—
rises to the dazzled view!
Thursday (Commons.)—The vote for the PBINCK OF WALKS'S India Bill was fought through the House, with just enough haggling'
to deprive the appropriation of perfect graoiousness.
Everybody, out MR. DISRAELI and MR. GLADSTONE, seems to think the Government has done the thing shabbily. To be sure, the
Government ought to know best.
Punch, with MB. FAWCETT, would have preferred that England should have paid every penny of the bill. India has certainly
not invited the PRINCE, and is as little in a position to invite him as she is to decline his visit: is certainly not as well able to afford the
expense of entertaining him as Canada was. As to the feeling of the Working-men (Punch is a representative Working-man, and knows),
nineteenth-twentieths of them—as MR. HURT, with characteristic straight-forwardness, admitted—neither think, nor care a ha'penny
about the matter: the other twentieth, including the blatant gentlemen who get up nasty noisy little mobs in Trafalgar Square, and
who claim to speak for the Working-men, because they speak, peculiarly, for themselves, oppose the visit and the grant for it—as they
oppose everything suggested by their betters, and, in particular, all grants to members of the Royal Family. They have found just
enough voice in Parliament to show how thoroughly they stand opposed to general opinion.
SIB WILFBID, for once, was rather forced, than gracious, in his fooling. The only hit of his speech worthy of himself or Punch
was the suggestion that, if the PRINCE'S trip was to be recommended from the educational stand-point, it should be in the interests rather
of Ministers than the PRINCE. For example, what a good thing it would be if the President and Secretary of the Board of Trade could
have the opportunity of a voyage to India to learn something about shipping!

ME. BRIGHT'S was the happiest suggestion,—that the PRINCE'S unfailing and unforced
courtesy, kindliness, and graciousness might, perhaps, serve as a lesson to Anglo-Indian
Officials, in their dealings with the " niggers."
This set up SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL'S back, and brought him on to his legs. Now SIR
GEORGE CAMPBELL on his legs with hit back up, is an animal so formidable that the House
— faint and hungry, and hard on dinner-time,—absolutely howled in horror of the onslaught.
They were reduced to submission by the Chairman's stern threat to clear the Bar—and then
SIB GEOROB was allowed to clear the House without farther expressions of dismay.
At ten, progress was reported to allow SIR CHARLES DILKE to bring forward his Motion
in favour of making our next Leap, not in the dark, but in as much light as inquiry can
bring to bear on it. MR. FAWCETT and MB. GOSCHEN supported the Motion. MB. DISRAELI,

rejection of SIR CHARLES'S Motion by 190 to 120.
Friday (Lords). — Another suggestion
(from LORD GALLOWAY) that we should pull
up CARDWELL'S Army-seed, to see how it is
growing. The DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE gave
the uaual warning—not yet often enough
repeated, it would seem—that nothing can
be so bad for the Army as constant change,
or suggestion of change, which is almost
as bad.
(Commons.) In Committee on the Labour
Laws Bills. Fog of Tuesday apparently
clearing up, but only to settle down again
over the Bills at last, thicker than ever.
The united wits of MESSRS. CROSS and
LOWB have elaborated a new clause—of
general application—in li«u of the Crimi-
nals Law Amendment Act, 1871 (the Picket-
ing Act). It proposes three months' im-
prisonment "for intimidation, or serious
annoyance, by violence or otherwise, with
a view to compel any person to do or ab-
stain from doing anything he has legal
right to do or abstain from doing."
Everybody approved of the clause as a
whole, and then proceeded to pick holes in
every part of it.
It is objected that it would apply to the
tradesman with a small account, who per-
vades MB. BRTEFLESS'S front door or club
steps, with a view to the pleasure of an
interview with that impecunious gentle-
man.
It really seems as if, in this Bill, the
labours of CROSS, LOWE & Co. have only
ended in making vaguer what was too vague
already, and in stretching the law which
they profess a desire to restrain.
Again, in the Employers and "Work-
men's Bill, MR. CROSS has succeeded in
getting rid of imprisonment, only to bring
it in at a further stage, as the remedy of
the surety who has to pay damages for the
defaulter.
ST. SWITHIN'S tail of fog has apparently
invaded the House and the heads of
Honourable Members. "Good intention
and bad invention" seems the only appro-
priate description of MR. CROSS'S and the
House's labours at these Labour Bills thus
far. They might be called the Labour-in-
vain Bills. The red-fire for the blaze of
triumph (see our last Cartoon but one)—we
sorely fear—has been lighted too soon.
The last battle of the Session, (it is to
be hoped) over the Judicature Act. Grand
triangular duel between those "eminent
combatants," SIR W. H. HARCOURT, W. E.
GLADSTONE, and SIR H. JAMES. SIR W.
HABCOURT says the strength of the Bench
is wasted by bad arrangements—that the
number of Judges, "has increased, is
increasing, and ought to be diminished."
MR. GLADSTONE said the same thing, and
sang, to boot, the pcean and dirge'of economy
—a virtue once dear to statesmen, now (he
says) respected and bewailed by himself
alone. A fig for efficiency!
SIB H. JAMES, on the other hand, main-
tains that it is arrears, not Judges, that
have increased, are increasing, and ought
to be diminished.
Who shall decide when Q.C.'s disagree?
(Evening Sitting,} — Shannon naviga-
tion—the old old story. The O'CONHOR
DON complains of extravagant plans, and
useless expenditure. SIR M. H. BEACH
complains, that though the Landlords are
very willing to tap the national purse to
the tune of hundreds of thousands, they
refuse to drain their own pockets of a
penny.
MR. BUTT draws the moral that the House
of Commons is incapable of dealing with
Irish Local affairs.
Mr. Punch is unable to draw any moral.

PUNCH, OE THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Hut he sees there never is any spending of money in or for Ireland,
hut it is !sure to lead to a cross-fire of charge and countercharge of
plunder, jobbery, and mismanagement, which tempts JOHN BULL
to wish he could, with a clean conscience, and a clear balance-sheet,
wash his hands of the whole troublesome and dirty business.
DR. LUSH urged the grievances of Army Medical Officers.
MH. HARDY showed a fair readiness to deal fairly with them.
THE PLAINT OF A PIGMY.
PITY me, kind Mr.
Punch.
I am a small man,
and am troubled
by small matters,
which to greater
men may seem of
insignificant ac-
count. Just now
one of my annoy-
ances is the custom
which prevails of
Ladies wearing
high-heeled shoes,
and piling up their
hair in the very
height of fashion,
which at present is
an altitude of highly
inconvenient ex-
tent. Thanks to
this, although I
really measure fully
five feet and four
inches and a quar-
terin my stockings,
I appear a perfect
pigmy when I ven-
ture to a flower-
show or other fashionable place of feminine resort.
Although an energetic dancer, I rarely go to balls, for I dislike to
dance with partners by whose side I look a dwarf. As for the
Academy, all the pictures on the line are utterly eclipsed by the
head-dresses in front of me, and I vainly stand on tiptoe to get a
passing glance at what I came to see. So too at the Opera I can
only catch a glimpse of A in inn, or Roaina, or Elsa, or Zerlina, as
they flit across the space between the piled-up curls before me.
Indeed I seriously think that MESSES. GYE AND MAPLESON should in
charity reserve some few front rows of the Stalls, for the exclusive
use and benefit of simple gentlemen of short stature, who are other-
wise debarred from a full sight of the stage.
In common fairness, then, I hold that persons of the fair sex, if
they would deserve that epithet, should diminish their unfair pro-
portions when they appear in public places, and should abandon the
unnatural excrescences of fashion which add so hugely to their
height. At present, though in point of mere material fact they are
looked up to, they hardly can expect to be held in high regard, at
least, by those to w_hom their presence is so highly inconvenient as
it now continually is to
Yours, SAM SHOET.
P.8.—Somebody in SUAKSPEA.KE somewhere says something about
the waves "curling their monstrous heads." Swell Ladies now are
like the waves—the swells of the sex—when they are at their
toilette and preparing for a party.

to the presence of muslin, even under canvas, precluded the gallant

EIFLES AND TRIFLES.
IT is no uncommon thing at our rural rifle-meetings to see some paltry little prizes
"donated" (as pur cousins say) by certain of the enterprising tradesmen of the district, who
want to see their names paraded in the newspapers. Prizes of this sort are generally fitter
for a raffle than a rifle-meeting, for they not infrequently consist of such small articles as
a cigar-case, or a corkscrew, or a pair of leather gaiters, or a bottle of old port. With the
knowledge that the eyes of all the " constant readers " in the country are upon them and their
presents, MB. STITCHER gives a pair of his famed fifteen-shilling trousers, and his neighbour
(M K. SCISSA us) presents one of his celebrated patent seamless shirts; while MB. POFFEB
perhaps offers a small photographic album, and MB. DFFFEB makes the gift of a pair of
hobnailed boots.
Everybody knows that prizes such as these are chiefly given as advertisements, and
everybody knows, too, that there is a proverb about looking at gift-horses in the mouth.
A walk through the prize-tent at Wimbledon this year will show that such advertisements
have crept into the Camp, and, for the credit of the one great meeting of the year, it might
be well to keep such little things in check. Unless more care be taken in revisal of the
prize-list, we may live to see a Bath bun or a penny trumpet presented to be shot for, or
perhaps a box of pipe-lights or an ounce of lollipops.

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OB, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.
By LEONARDO DKLLA ROBBIA DE TUDOR WESTPOND TUMPKYNS,
ESQ., S.A.8., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the Dulli-
ilillitunty Society*
AT this point you will generally find in Grammars what is termed
an
EXERCISE ow THE ARTICLE.
• ,>

Our instances shall speak for themselves: e.g.—
/ ride on a Chair. My Brother dances on the Table. Our
Grandmother is rolling on the Hearth-rug. Your Sister is tearing a
Window-sash. Tommy is kicking
the Door. The Boy is thumping the
Piano. The Girl is playing Cricket
with the China Ornaments.
And so on.
Of Substantives and Gender in
furnishing, we will not treat at
present. Perhaps we shan't say
anything about them at all. We 'II
see.
Number.—No Grammar of Deco-
rative Art would be perfect were
"Number " left out. There can, in
furnishing, be any number of any-
thing. This rule can be best com-
prehended by the following exam-
ples: e.g.—
We bought two hundred and sixty
Pokers with brass handles. He
bought fifty Stoves and seventy Side-
boards. She bought three hundred China Cups, seventy Ornamental
Vases, sixty specimens of Wedgewood, and a hundred Louis Quatorze
Tables.
This will give you some idea of Number in Decorative Art. There
is also, as in Greek, the dual number. Things go in pairs, as
candlesticks, sugar-tongs, &c.,
and cannot be sold separately.
Of the use of the Adjective
and Adverb in Decorative Art
not much need be said here.
Everything is "0, quite too
lovely 1" "0, what a little
duck of a thing!" "How de-
lioiously frightful!" "How
frightfully charming!" "How
quite too inexpressibly horribly
lovely!".
Adjectives are considerably
used by the vendor, as e.g.,
"That little table there is
really beautiful." "You
couldn't get so perfect a pair of
candlesticks if you were to try
everso!" "That lovely escri-
toire, Ma'am, is a decided
bargain at thirty-six guineas,"
&C.. &C.
Possessive Adjectives. — The
use of these is evident. You buy a chair and it's yours. This is,
by the way, how to make chairs
into washing-basins. Do you see?


buy my three chairs,
and "then my thri
Why, you ,
ree chairs become
ewers.
"Ewer another I " as the sugar-
basin said to the washing-basin.
Exercise on the Possessive Ad-
jectives in furniture is simple:
e.g.—
Here, jump up! that's my
Chair. Get out.' that's my Bed.
It'» thy Table, is it f then thou
wilt pay for thine. It's his Piano.
I say, those are our Carpets you 're
beating so cruelly! fyc.
Cases.—As for Cases in such a
Grammar of Furnishing Decorative
Art as this, there are various cases:
—Book oases, writing oases, wine
cases, spirit cases, music oases,
pillow cases, brush oases, cigar oases, glass cases, &o., &o., which
we must notice in due order, that is, as you order them, beginning
with wine cases—say a case
of Pommery ires sec. (Ad-
dressed here, of course, to the
Author of this work.0)
If you would be really ori-
ginal, be guided by me, and
never follow precedent for
precedent's sake. For in-
stance, if it strikes you that
a grand piano would be ad-
mirably adapted for a four-
post bedstead, do not hesitate
to fit the mattress on to the
strings, your pillow near the
keyboard, space for your ., .,.,,.
hands to pats through on to
the notes, and, after a very
little practice, your fingers would wander easily and lazily over the


\
octaves, and you could play yourself drowsily to sleep. A banjo
upside down would form a first-rate looking-glass for shaving.
If a carpet would, in your opinion,
serve better for a blind, have it up,
and make a blind of it. If anyone
says to you, "You can't make a look-
ing-glass into a feather bed," at once
seize the opportunity for trying it.
Depend upon it, there are many uses
to which glass may be put, at present
quite unknown, because hitherto un-
tried. Had the idiot, who laid down
the maxim that "there is nothing
like leather," been able to prevent
anyone from using glass, we should
still have been drinking out of the
"leather bottel," and decanters would
have yet to be invented.
* Opportunity for advertisement. Never
were such times! I take the opportunity
of informing Upholsterers, House Decora-
ters, &c., that here is a splendid chance for
advertisement. Being committed to no one
taste in particular, I am open to the best ofl'er, and am prepared to give, in
the course of these useful hints, the names and addresses in full, with list of
cheapest prices, of all those tradesmen who have the true interest! of art in
view. My artist will also execute designs for furniture, with the name and
address of the maker appended. We, the author and the artist, are willing
to take it out in part cash, part furniture, or articles of vtrtu, and our motto
is " An tonga, but business is business."
P.8.—The Editor takes this opportunity to warn tradesmen against the
artist calling at their shops and undertaking to execute designs in this work
on his own account for value received. He is unauthorised to do anything
without the Editor. Share and share alike.
(To be continued.')

"THE SADDLE ON THE RIGHT HORSE."
PARIS has got an International Exhibition of "Maritime and
Fluvial Industries." It includes, in the French Export Department,
"a trophy of Saddlery." For a moment we were at sea on reading
this piece of information, and at a loss to account for the pre-
sence of Saddlery in a Maritime Exhibition; but then we remembered
our old friends the Horse Marines," and understood at once that
the trophy must consist of their equipments.

amused the foreign attaches immensely. Can't write any more just
now, as I am off to Shoeburyness to see some pretty, but rather ex-
pensive, fireworks. Don't forget Wimbledon.
Yours ever, GEOHGE.
Mr. Punch, who is the'most amiable of men. at once consented to
comply with a request so becomingly expressed, and, without delay,
travelled down to the Camp. At Clapham Junction he was invited
to change carriages, and found that the Railway Companies, with
that forethought for which they are renowned, had prepared a little
preliminary puzzle for the Volunteers, evidently with a view to
testing their knowledge of military tactics. The tunnel underneath
the Station was in the hands of the plasterers; and as all the ordi-
nary directions on the walls had been carefully painted out, it was
a matter of chance if you turned up on a platform "right" for
Brighton, or got into a train warranted to carry you all the way to
Exeter in something less than no time. After an hour spent in a
fruitless search for a conveyance bound for Wimbledon, Mr. Punch
entered a vacant carriage, and soon found himself safely landed at
Putney. The comparative dexterity with which this feat was ac-
complished, was strongly suggestive of a third-rate conjuring trick
performed by a fourth-
rate conjuror. However,
Mr. Punch did certainly
arrive at Putney, and Put-
ney is, as everyone knows,
but a step from Wimble-
don. Remembering the
beauties of the Cedars, and
the fashions of the Camp,
he begs to add that he
found that step was the
step that divided the Sub-
lime from the Ridiculous.
On his way to the ground
the Great Creature was in-
vited to have his portrait
"done" by a Photogra-
phic Artist, who was " ta-
king off" a gentleman
of melancholy appearance,
"pour encourager let att-
tres." The offer was re-
fused.
Passing the Camp gate,
with its guard of police-
men, Mr. Punch found
himself in the enclosure. He noticed immediately that, in the
majority of cases, the Volunteers, in pitching their tents, had
neglected to follow the golden rule of camping out, "When in
doubt (of the weather) dig a trench."
With a deep sigh, Mr. Punch gloomily pursued his way. "In spite
of the camp nag of the Victoria Rifles, which I see, very appropriately,
contains a skull and crossbones," said the Great Man, "I fear the
Volunteers will never exactly understand the duties of real soldiers.
Stay, what have we here!"
he added, as abold yeoman,
in martial array strutted
past, with all the majesty
of a Lord Mayor, and more
than the dignity of a
suburban peacock. "Come,
this is very fair, indeed,
murmured Mr. Punch, ap-
Erovingly. "Boots, tunic,
elmet, and pouch-belt.
And now for the side-arms.
Ah! as I feared! That
fatal, that death-dealing
blow—an umbrella!" And
Mr. Punch felt very much
inclined to weep long and
bitterly. Had he no cause
for sorrow? Yes, indeed,
indeed he had. On all sides
the same utter disregard
for appearances met his
view. Volunteers in wide-
awakes of all colours, and
of every description, Volun-
teers in straw hats, Volnn-
teers in "chimney-pots,"
Volunteers in caps! The
same old story—careless-
ness and lack of discipline turning a magnificent force of patriots
into a body of mock marksmen—into an army of sham soldiers!


Walking away from the absurd umbrella-bearer clad in a helmet,
Mr. Punch prepared to enter one of the tents. There were beds
of flowers on either side of the opening, and in one of the beds
stood a board, bearing the inscription "CAPTAIN 8. BOUQUET. 443rd
Loamshire Rifles—the Soldier's Retreat." "Here, I say," mur-
mured the proprietor, languidly, "you mustn't come in until you
have wiped your feet." Mr. Punch left some mud on a cocoa-nut
mat, and entered "The
Soldier's Retreat." The
soldier seemed to have re-
treated very comfortably.
A thick carpet was spread
over the boarded floor.
On the carpet stood mar-
queterie tables, easy chairs,
and a piano. The atmos-
phere was suggestive of
a perfumer's snop; and
the ensemble would have
been invaluable to an
artist drawing (for a perio-
dical circulating in the
kitchen) an illustration
to a story of excessively
high life. A sketch of
the interior of the tent
would have done nicely
for a picture representing
"The Boudoir of the
Wicked Duke."
"Rather snug, eh?"
said CAPTAIN BOUQUET,
"next year I shall have
the canvas papered and
hung with pictures. Can't
do more than that! You
must rough it you know,
when you get to Wim-
bledon."
"Enough of this," cried
Mr. Punch. "I will have
no more of it," and he
hastened to the happy
shooting fields where small
bore men after firing their
rifles become (if they can
only secure an audience),
big bore men, in their ex-
planation of why they did
not make a "bull, or
wherefore they neglected
to score even an outer.
He was particularly pleased with the new positions. They seemed
to be both easy and effective.
"Must shoot in uniform," said a stout Rifleman, who seemed to
shrink from " trying his size " for certain weighty reasons.


"Very proper regulation, indeed," commented Mr. Punch; and he
noticed that one of the competitors (evidently a soldier every inch
of him) had complied with this rule by wearing a complete suit of
mufti plus a sword-belt attached to an umbrella.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

"Come," said he, " that is what I call entering into the spirit of
the thing! Would that there were more men like that Gallant
Rifleman in Wimbledon!"
The wish of Mr. Punch was granted—he noticed before leaving
the Camp that there were many more men like the Gallant Rifle-
man in question.
Clasping Rifle Exercises and Musketry Instructions, Pocket
Edition by Authority, fondly to his breast (regardless, it will be
seen, of the regulation printed on the cover, ordering him to carry
it in his pocket), the Hero of a Hundred Sights continued to notice
the shooting. Mr. Punch (easily tired with the monotonous occu-
pation) was about to turn away when he saw his old friend Full
Private (very Full Private) BUFFLES preparing to add another
"bull" to his fast increasing score. He remembered the Full
Private's saying in days gone by, "If you want to make a big
figure at the targets, fire on the top of a good meal—never empty,
my boy." And here was BUFFLES as large as (after dinner) life
preparing to shoot in his accustomed style. His left arm rested on
its habitual support, no one who looked at him could doubt it for a
moment—BUFFLES was evidently firing on the top of a good meal!
.-o

And now Mr. Punch was fairly taken by surprise. The clouds
gathered together into a compact mass, and. to his intense astonish-
ment, it began to rain again! Rain at Wimbledon! Who ever heard
of such a thing! And then it was that the skill of the tent-pitcher
was tested. Those who bad dug trenches and had cast their camp
on the side of a hill were rewarded for their forethought; those who
had done neither of these things, soon assumed the appearance of
heavily-moistened sponges.
"CAPTAIN 8. BOUQUET in "The Soldiers' Retreat," and the rest of
the Bandbox Brigade, must be very, very happy!" and Mr. Punch
laughed long and heartily.
The First General of his Age now waited for the rain to cease
(those who know how long he had to wait will keenly appreciate his
self-sacrifice), and hurried to his tent. The sun shone brightly as
he made the champagne cup. The birds sang their best, and the
crack of the rifle in the distance was pleasant indeed. Mr. Punch
sat down near his own tent-pole, and welcomed his guests—Comely
Canada, Arch America, and Juvenile Japan. He pledged them
with three times three (three cheers for each of them—COCKKR), and
they were simply delighted. He saw near him, in happy fraternisa-
tion, JOHN BULL with his rose, PAT with his shamrock, SAWMBY
with his thistle, and YANKEE DOODLE wearingthe feather of a
Macaroni. Everything was delightful, and Wimbledon never
looked so well. And why was this? The question was easily
answered. When Mr. Punch looked at Wimbledon for the last
time, he was following the fashion, and wearing a pair of glasses.
Those glasses (evidently with a view to counteracting the glare of
the sun) were stained. The colour of the stain was—coukur de rose!
"CREDE BYRON."
"I desire that my body may bo buried in the vault of tbo garden of
Newstead, without uny ceremony or burial service whatever, and that no
inscription, «ave my name and ago, bo written on the tomb or tablet."—
BVKO.V'S WM. (Stt " Times," July H.)
WHAT perils posthumous environ
The mighty Poet's radiant fame
Which fools and scoffers sought to shame!
The Churchmen, prejudiced and shabby,
Denied him entrance to the Abbey:
And wherefore so? Because, forsooth,
In Days of Sham he wrote the Truth—
Wrote it with keen, indignant ire,
In letters of eternal fire:
"Crede BYHON!"
When that strong wml began to tire on
Its upward flight, iti haughty way,
Into the worlds where song hath sway,
He, thinking of his final rest,
Dreamt of the place he loved the best,
Longed that soft earth should crumble o'er him
Where slept his passionate race before him,
Nothing thereon except his name—
Two syllables of deathless fame:
"Crede Braow!"
Clay mingled with his strength of iron:
But he was greater far than they
Who dare to call him wholly clay.
If England wishes something done
For her last Age's strongest son,
Be it his statue, calm and grand,
By the first sculptor of the land.
Touch not his homely churchyard stone—
"My Monument my Name alone:"
"Crede BYKON!"
What can we do for Him?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.


issiON closing in
jostle and jar:
A block of growlers
at Temple Bar:
Bills prert forward,
and nobody glad
of it:
Hills dropt that
earnest men go
mad of it;
Hunting with
bounds, and run-
ning with hare;
Tbe belt fight a Cross-fight, everywhere,
Till BENJAMIN'S mean, swelling more and more,
Threatens the Parliament Pot to boil o'er!"
"Facit indignatio venum." Would
there were less reason in the rhyme.
Slavery may easily creep in under the
guise of apprenticeship. Knowing what
horrors have been perpetrated in unregu-
lated Coolie-traffic, under the Portuguese
flag above all (Lords, Monday, July 19),
we may be glad to learn, from the answer
to LOBD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY'S question, that since a Commis-
sion reported on that traffic, LORD CABNARVON is not taking the
matter coolly, but preparing an ordinance for the better protec-
tion in transitu of these ill-used black cattle.
Reaction in favour of Enightsbridge Barracks and the much-
maligned Six-foot Guards found a voice through LORD LUCAS
and H.R.H. the Commander-in-Chief. The soldiers were
exemplary. The blackguardly beershops and music-halls in the
neighbourhood were the fruit of lax licensing, not of barrack
customers. The barracks were not fever-nests, though they were
not so sweet as they might be, if proper care and cost had been
expended on keeping them in repair. Lastly, strategical consi-
derations pointed to the site; and, as the Duke said, sensibly,
the houses had come to the barracks, not the barracks to the houses.
(Commons.) Now the rammer exodus is about to begin, the British traveller may be glad to learn,
on Foreign Office authority, that passports are not abolished in Austria; that in Italy F. 0. is
Mill writing about their abolition: that in France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Sweden, and
Germany they have been abolished, but may still come in useful, to prove identity or stave off
suspicion.
The Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition wants to know what are the business arrangements for
the rest of the Session.
The Leader of Her Majesty's Government not knowing, cannot say. All he knows is, that
they mean to go on with Committee on Agricultural Holdings Bill; then with Merchant Shipping
Bill (ride the scene of Thursday); then with Land Transfer and Judicature; and then with any
little unconsidered trifles there may still be time for whipping up, in the fag end of any odd days
or hours that may still be left over.
With that love of labour which distinguishes him, the Marquis congratulated the House on a
programme that promised to carry the Session well into September. A general chorus of groan
and grumble, in which an undertone from the Government side was distinctly audible.
MR. WHALLET complained he could not get a Seconder for his inquiry into the Jesuits, so
completely had the underhand machinations of the Order paralysed the House itself!
MR. DISRAELI protested against being expected to jump up " in a harum-scarum manner," and
doom Measures to death without full consideration. As to the Jesuits, he always understood it
was one of the dodges of the Order to keep a lay brother to go about abusing them up-hill and down
dale. He left it to the House to draw the inference.
The rest of the night was devoted to talk on the Motion for going into Committee on the Agri-
cultural Holdings Bill, when a great deal of fire was wasted that should have been kept for
Committee.
Bra T. ACLAND said the Bill would not do for Devonshire.
MR. ASMIETON that it would not suit Lancashire.
MR. GOLDSMID that it wasn't at all the thing for Kent.
LORD ELCHO condemned it as big with the germs of rank socialism, and looked on it with alarm,
not for what it contained, but what it would lead to.
SIR W. HARCOURT approved of it for the very same reasons. Then there was a fight for adjourn-
ment, and finally progress was reported before any progress was made.
Punch is really inclined to think better than he did at first of a Bill that partisans and hobby-
riders on all sides seem so dissatisfied
with. At the same time, he must
say nobody seems to want it
Tuesday (Lords).—The DUKE OF
RICHMOND declined to reassure LORD
CAMPERDOWN against an indefinite
increase of water-rates, part passu
with assessment-valuations. London
is to be congratulated on the pro-
spect of unreaisted and irresistible
•^pilling and polling" from both
Water Companies and Vestries!
(Commons.) Conspiracy and Pro-
tection of Property Bill huddled
through Committee, under protest
from MR. LOWE that he felt humi-
liated to be Member of a Parliament
that had passed the Bill as it stood.
The Bill has been drawn as might
be expected of a measure meant to
carry out Cross-Purposes. Thus
when MR. FLIMSOLL moved to in-
clude Seamen in its operation, MR.
LOWE had to show him that Sailors
were the only persons exempted from
the penalties of the Act to which
their champion wished to subject
them.
In Committee on Agricultural
Holdings Bill a long and desultory
preliminary fight over SIR G. JF.N-
KINSON'S Motion to exempt all hold-
ings held under written agreement.
Evident division of opinion in the
Government camp; MR. DISRAELI
fighting shy. His Party clearly
suspicions of the Bill; ana, if they
could have their way, glad to wash
their hands of the business alto-
gether.
MB. HUBBARD, on Local and Im-
perial Taxation, counted out just
after nine. The House tired to
death, and MR. HUBBARD, on any
of his hobbies, a decidedly heavy-
goer.
Wednesday.—The regular hobby-
riders protesting, of course, against
the cruel discipline of the Count-
Out, as administered the night
before.
MESSRS. NEWDEOATE, WHALLET,
MONK, P. A. TAILOR, and Mn-
KLL-llENBY, very plaintive on the
practice—
"Tbey best can paint it who have felt it
most."
_ The House knows better what its
time is worth, and how precious is its
one weapon against the ever-threat-
ening bore.
MR. M'CABTHT DOWNING moved
his Bill to make Irish paupers irre-
movable home after a year's residence
north or south of Tweed. MR.
DOWNING wants not only "Ireland
for the Irish," but so much of Eng-
land and Scotland as the Irish panper
stands on. The whole subject of
settlement and removal for Scotch
and English as well as Irish paupers
will have to be considered during the
recess; and on this understanding
the Bill was thrown out.
Thursday (Lords).—Sale of Food
and Drugs Bill passed without the
"knowingly," but with a provision
that a seller of falsified articles should
escape penalty if he could prove he
did not Enow of the falsification. If
the Bill as passed is not all it should
be, it is at least better than it was—
thanks to Her Majesty's Opposition;
and so Punch may say of the
VOL. LXTJC.

LORD DERBY gave an instructive history of the French folly, by which

wisely declines to crown that folly by any retaliatory folly on our part in the

(Commons). After a long cross fire of question'and answer, crowned by an
inquiry peculiarly a propos to the present state of Parliamentary business,
as to the prospect of the Infanticide Bill, MB. DISBAELI rose to announce
the withdrawal of the Merchant Shipping Bill, overlaid by the Agricultural
Holdings Bill. What are losses of life to leases for life? The scene which
followed is no subject for comic comment. Mr. Punch will only express
his deep sympathy with MB. PLIMSOLL, whose indignation at seeing once
more dashed from his lips the hope of remedying a great wrong, to the
righting of which he has devoted his heart and soul and strength, overcame
his self-control, and led him into a fierce defiance of the rules of the House of
Commons, for which, in his cooller moments, he will be the readiest to ask
pardon. The House behaved well throughout the painful scene. But what
does MB. PLIMSOLL mean by being so terribly in earnest?
Friday (Lords).—Angry attack on the Examination turnstile, admitting
to Commissions. EARLS HARROWBY, STANHOPE, GREY, and LOBD STRATHNAIBN
can no more understand the connexion between CHAUCEB'S Canterbury Tales
and a Commission than LORD DUNDBEARY could that between cows and
shrimps. A good deal of dirt was flung, by the way, into CHATJCEB'B "pure
well of English undefiled." H.ll.H. the Commander-in-Chief and LOBD
CARDWELL both explained that the examination was meant to test, not
military, but general education. As it was found that the best officers came
from the Public Schools, the point was to examine in what the Public School
taught.
The EABL or HABROTVBY was curious to know La what public school
CHAOCER was now read?
LORD GBANVILLE frankly admitted that not one word of English was taught
in the public school in which he was.
(Mr. Punch is bound to make the same admission. Things may be better now.
If the public school curriculum is to be the guide to the Examiners for Com-
missions, it seems to Mr. P. that rowing, cricket, foot-
ball, and hockey ought to be the telling "subjects " for
marks in the competitive examinations. And not at all
bad ones either. The complaint is that there is too little
of that sort of thing in the "exams" as they are; that
being conducted by bookworms they are naturally book-
wormish, and calculated to bring bookwormish boys to
the top. If they sifted out the lads who come to the
front by '' natural selection " in our public school playing
fields, they would give us just the right raw material for
soldiers—the JOHN BULL instead of the JOHN CHINAMAN
element of England's youth.
The whole subject of competitive examination wants
overhauling by the light of common sense. Standing
between our public schools and our public service, it
ought to be working to the improvement of both. But
it may be worked to the advantage of neither, and by
and for that pernicious person, the crammer, wholly
and solely. Is it? This is what their Lordships want
to know. And the country has a right to know too.)
A long and instructive discussion on the Constitu-
tion of Natal. That colony, like the rest of the lot,
seems in uncommonly capable hands while LOBD CAR-
NARVON looks after them. He gave a screed of excellent
advice to the Natalians (from the Bishop downwards)—
to bury the war-hatchet, and " take up de fiddle and de
hoe "—tools of good fellowship and industry.
(Commons). Lengthy, and let us hope, instructive
discussion on manures, crops, seeds, chalking, and other
points of agricultural chemistry. Pleasant to see how
anxious Honourable Members seem, like Honourable
Lords before them, to be left free to contract themselves
out of this best of all possible hills. If tenants are
equally anxious, Mr. Punch is puzzled to think who
will not be contracted out of the Bill.
Long argument on the nice question—has MB. MAPLE-
SON got the whip-hand of the Board of Works, or the
Board of Works the pull of MR. MAPLESON, in nettling
the arrangements for the site of the New Opera House?
If the end is a model Opera-House, Mr. P. would not
consider the matter too curiously. London will be the
gainer.
If MB. GREGORY and the Commission whose report he
quotes are sound in their conclusion that there are a
million of acres in England fit for enclosure and culti-
vation, he is right in 'moving that the schemes of the
Enclosure Commissioners, embracing 83,000 acres, and
now waiting for Parliamentary sanction, ought to be
proceeded with. With two provisoes: First, that the
Enclosure Commissioners don t play any tricks such ag
the Office of Woods proposed to play with the New Forest
(happily, as we see by the Report of the Select Com-
mittee, to be placed beyond further risk of desecration);
and, secondly, that for every acre given to the Lord
of the Manor a liberal equivalent is secured to the poor
whose rights will be ousted by enclosure.
In this connection, MB. FAWCETT is quite right. Be-
fore any enclosure schemes are proceeded with, the En-
closure Act ought to be amended, with a view to better
provision for the rights of the public and the poor.

our Army is utterly valueless. I insist upon it that our soldiers
are merely children of tender years and no stamina—that their
number is as limited as their powers of endurance.
You may tell me that the Authorities declare (a declaration not
without proof) that the recruits are excellent and numerous, that
:he Summer Manoeuvres are a perfect success, that, in fact, every-
thing I advance is reckless and wrong.
To these assertions I return the unanswerable reply: All these
statements may be perfectly correct (I have no doubt they are), but
— and here comes my point—I don't think to.
Although I have said above all that I can say upon this subject,
and all that I have ever said upon this subject, I would still write a
great deal more about it, were it not that I am now going quietly

what it is, my boy, we haven't much time for scribbling. No, my
lad, what we have got to do is to work • and, though I gay it who
shouldn't, work we do with as good a will as needs be.
We have had such a time of it at Aldershott! Rain day after
day, and march morning after morning; and marching in heavy
order " is no Joke. Do yon think we minded it, my boy? Don't
you make no mistake. Why, we were as cheery as possible,
a doing the work of horses, and such like, as if it were the
pleasantest thing in the world. Grumble? Not a bit of it I Why,
we don't know how to; but I tell you what, my boy, the singing in
the camp was something to listen to, and the laughter would have
done your heart good if you 'd been there to hear.
And then on the march! Why, the only thing as really was un-
popular was the Ambulance Cart. You see it was no manner of use
to us. We weren't a going to set into it—not a mother's son of us!
Ah, BILL, they write a deal of nonsense about us. Why, the
other day, my lad, as I looked at the old Rag on parade, with
"Waterloo " and Inkennan" and the rest of them a fluttering in
the wind, I couldn't help a thinking of the chorus of an old song I
heard sung a long time ago. It was something like this :—
"What Old England once has done

WISE MEN ON VACCINATION.
ITT the Court of Queen's
Bench has sat its last, if
it can now no longer
punish Contempt of Court.
Can it? This question has
been raised by the Wise
Men of Eeighley.
The Bradford Observer
reports a meeting of these
Wise Men, to wit the
Guardians of Keighley
Union, held the other day
in the Board-room of the
Workhouse. The Sages
met to deliberate upon
THE MANDAMUS!
This Writ, isiued against
the Keighley Guardians,
recites, that they have ne-
glected to carry out the
Vaccination Act, and com-
mands them forthwith to
make their Vaccination
- Officer do his duty, or to
show cause to the con-
trary. It is signed by
LORD CHIEF JUSTICE COCK-
— BURN. The Wise Men's
Clerk having presented it to the Wise Men, who in their wisdom
object to Vaccination, there ensued a debate which had a most
apt sequel. But many wise things were said first.
The Chairman, MB. MILNER, read a number of wise resolutions
which he bad received. One, from a public meeting at Bingley,

denounced the vaccination laws, thanked the Eeighley Guardians
"for fighting for the freedom of the people," and promised "to
support them in every way required." In another, from Middleton, •
admiration for and sympathy with the Keighley Guardians were
expressed for refusing to be made the ignoble tools of the Local
Government Board." Also, the Cheltenham and Gloucester Anti-
Compulsory League sent to say, through their Secretary, "that
they had contributed to the defence fund." Were not they of the
wise of whom it is said that they and their money are soon parted?
A Wise Man, MB, CBABTREK, "asked if the last was from the
Magna Charta Association?" This eminently wise question excited
"laughter;" and then another Wise Man, ME. JEFFERT, answered,
"No, we have nothing to do with that lot." More laughter. The
Wise Men laughed at something in which they saw wit—surely not
at the suggestion of fellowship with the Magna Charta Association
and the '' lot" who follow WKAILSY the Wise and KEHEALY the
Conscientious.
MR. JEFFERY went on dropping pearls of wisdom. The non-
prosecution of vaccination defaulters had been practised at that
Board for twenty years. The Local Government had only now
discovered that it was illegal. The only difference was that pre-
viously the majority of the Board had been for prosecutions, and
now all the breaches of the law took place when there was a
majority that voted against vaccination. Those opposed to prose-
cutions had been returned to the Board by a majority of one thousand
in most casee. The people who so elected them believed that disease
was engendered in their children by vaccination, and in some
instances the children had been brought to the grave by it:—
"For his part, he could not see that they had done any wrong. There had
been some talk about breaking the law, but they had only voted on the ques-
tion of pro and can., the only difference being that a majority was now
opposed to vaccination. He would give the Court of Queen's Bench that
answer."
Time was when that answer to the Court of Queen's Bench would
have got a rejoinder which the Wise Men might not have liked.
Will it yet? The Wise Men will see.
MB. JEFF BUY added that :—
"H« gave them nil ideas in bib and chops, and other gentlemen could put
it into shape?"
The Mandamus having now had paid to it all the attention which
the Collective Wisdom of Keighley thought it deserved, thus spoke
"The CHAIRMAN (after a pause): Unless any gentleman has anything to
more, I '11 puss on to the next business."
But a Wise Man, wise otherwise than his colleagues,—
"MR. REDMAN begged the Chairman's pardon. Here they had a Mandamus
calling upon them to obey the law, which in this matter was interpreted by
tbe Judges to be absolute, and they had the first opportunity of answering it
by showing cause."
In this strain MR. REDMAX proceeded to point out the wisdom
which the Wise Men would exercise by treating the Mandamus with
some degree of respect, and he proposed a Motion accordingly. This
occasioned an argument replete with logic, of which space only
allows a specimen. Wise Man JEFFERY having said that "he did
not believe it was the law that they could be forced," this dialogue
followed:—
"UK. KIDMAN. The Judges say BO.
"Mlu JEFFBRY. 0, yea, the writ says SD, but we don't believe it.
"Ma. REDMAN. We had better ask the Law Clerk's opinion.
"MR. JEFFEHY. No, no; he has already given his opinion. He stands as
a pivot between us, and does fair by both parties. But what this paper says
is that we are to show cause.
"Mlt SKUU WICK. We may do so or not.
"-Mil. JKKFEHY. We are to nuke a return."
Then the Chairman uttered words of wisdom concerning the com-
munication of diseases by vaccine lymph—wisdom mostly unutter-
able except to a Board of Guardians. And he said, meaning either
the Vaccination Act or the Mandamus—
"He really hoped that they would pass on to the next business, and not
take any notice of Buck a law. He moved that they do so accordingly."
The motion to pass on to the next business having been carried
against Mo. REDMAN'S amendment by eight to five—
"The Board immediately after arranged to visit the West Riding Lunatic
Asylum at Wakefield, on the 27th iuet., and to apply for a llagirtrate's order
lor admission."
An appropriate end of their proceedings!
A wise commencement" was succeeded by "an answerable
sequestration." No doubt the Wise Men of Keifrhley have since
visited the Lunatic Asylum. Of course the Magistrate to whom
they applied instantly granted them an order for admission. Any
medical man would have written them a certificate. The only ques-
tion is—Have they been let out again?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A NOVEL EXHIBITION.
oo Shows and
Donkey Shows.
HORSE Shows and
Hound Shows.
Cat Shows and
Cattle Shows,
have been plenti-
ful of late; and
at last by way of
novelty the Crys-
tal Palace has
been tempting us
to go and see a
Goat Show. Baby
Shows we have
beheld, which
some may have
called Kid Shows';
but a Goat Show
is a new thing in
the way of Exhi-
bitions, and if it
be found success-
ful, it will doubt-
less be succeeded.
Perhaps we may
ere long be treat-
ed to a Bore
Show, and this,
if "got np properly, would we daresay prove attractive. The
only fear is lest the Bores, being mostly private persons, would
not quite like to be exhibited in public; and though, each of them
is perfectly well used to make an exhibition of himself, we may
doubt if they would wish to be advertised and shown " en masse."
The Crystal Palace is quite welcome to our notion of the Show, and
we venture to append a catalogue of Bores, who might with great
propriety apply to be exhibited.
That the Show would be attended well we entertain no question.
Indeed there cannot be a doubt that their friends would all flock
thither to see—at a safe distance—such immense Bores as the fol-
lowing :—
The Bore who interrupts your story with irrelevant remarks, and
asks, "Well, what happened then?" when you have come to what
your emphasis has shown to be the climax.
The Bore who fancies he is gifted with poetic inspiration, and
publishes small pieces "for private circulation," and expects to hear
them, quoted by his friends.
The Bore who takes you by the button-hole when he meets you at
the Club, and bothers you to death by asking your opinion on some
family affair, which he describes with such prolixity that long
before he finishes you have utterly forgotten what he said at
starting.
The Bore who falls asleep behind yon in the Stalls, and, by his
snoring obligate, spoils your hearing of the Opera.
The Bore who, having spent a fortnight in Calcutta, seizes every
chance of lugging in allusions to his Indian experience.
The Bore who has the fame of being " such a funny fellow," and
thinks himself obliged to sustain his reputation by making silly puns
and senseless practical jokes.
The Bore with a big voice who bawls your name out like a toast-
master when he sees you in society, and slaps you on the back when
he accosts you in the street.
The Bore who always tries to travel' with the carriage-windows
shut, and kicks up a great row if you insist on opening one of them.
The dyspeptic Bore who takes delight in talking of his ailments,
and often ends by making you feel out of health yourself.
The (esthetic Bore who worries you with lectures on fine Art,
and tempts you to buy pictures which you think extremely ugly,
but which he assures you are " worth their weight in gold "—which,
if you were to weigh them, would not come to very much.
The Bore who, somehow or another, always manages to forestall
you in telling the good thing which you were told the other day, and
which you meant to tell yourself if you could anyhow lead up to it.
The Bore who waltzes at a pace peculiar to himself, and causes
endless collisions in his circle of (dance) acquaintance.
The Bore who, if he hears you say that you like music, treats you
to a sermon upon Lohengrin and WAGNER.
And, finally, the Bore who with some vehemence starts off talking
shop" while you are talking "shop," and you discover, to your
horror, that his shop is not your shop I

'T was the voice of the Sunshade, I heard her complain,
"I 'm of no use at all, for we' ve nothing but rain.
Bright Sol is deposed by the Demon of Damp,
And I' m put in the shade by that odious Gamp!"
Stout Gingham laughed loud till her ribs seemed to split.
"Aha! Madame Upstart, you 're lowered a bit.
Your flauntings and flirtings with Phoebus are over,
I warned you the God was a changeable lover!
Hoho! but you used to look down upon me.

To see me the favourite friend of both sexes;

THE ASTRONOMER-ROYAL AMONG THE
SPECTACLE-MAKERS.
HE Honourable Com-
pany of Spectacle-
Makers gave SIR
GEORGE AIRY a din-
ner the other day.
He in return gave
them some good ad-
vice, which was—to
learn to make Specta-
cles 1 "Heknew only
one capable maker of
glasses." This advice,
strange to say, was
very kindly received;
and, after dining last
week at the Castle at
Richmond, the Spec-
tacle-Makers deter-
mined to turn over
a new leaf and study
their business. Hi-
therto, evidently, the
blind have been mak-
ing glasses for the
blind. But Mr. Punch
begs leave to inform
his friend the Astro-
nomer - Royal that
when his keen sight
fails, if anything so improbable should occur, he will ask him for
the name and address of that "ONE capable maker of glasses"
already in existence.
Competent judges, if invited to dinner by other Honourable Com-
panies, might give them equally useful and appropriate advice
—Ctuque in sun arle credendum est. The best dressed man in
England (commonly reputed to be the Master of Her Majesty's
Buckhounds) should be banqueted by the Merchant Taylors, that he
might give them his opinion as to how many of them can out a
coat properly. The Lorimcrs should certainly invite the Chairman
of the Four-in-Hand Club, who could tell them what he thought
of their bits and chains. The Bowstring-Makers could not do
better than entertain the Member for Orton, as he draws the long
bow with fatal facility. As to Mr. Punch, he reserves himself for
the Vintners, who may rely on his being quite as candid and in-
structive as to the difference between sound and unsound liquor,
and the importance of the choice of houses, as affecting your
chances of getting one or the other, as SIR GKOHGE A THY on the
qualities and makers of spectacle-glasses. The Vintners' glasses,
by the way, have this advantage over the spectacle-makers'—that
they make one see double.

Milk Wine may be presumed to have, in a degree, the
same properties as those of milk punch, and, in excess,
to produce the same effects as those which milk punch
produced on Mr. Pickwick. There are beings who will
not scruple to suggest that a real milk wine ought to
yield genuine cream of the valley; but that kind of
cream is not to be obtained from Koumiss. They may,
however, some day catch a Tartar, who will inform them
that the original Koumiss is obtained from mare's milk;
as MB. BBAIXAQHAIT says, by a curious coincidence. He
hopes this Koumiss may prove a hit in the bull's-eye.

The balance upset of the skyey powers.
So does Punch, and hopes the Zodiac soon
May recover the equilibrium of June.

AN ELEMENT OF CONFUSION.
FROM a Report just issued by a Committee of the
Society of Arts, on the Application of Science and Art
to the Street Paving and Street Cleansing of the Me-
tropolis, it appears that the Streets of London lie for
those purposes under the divided jurisdiction of some
fourteen separate YestrieSj who mend their ways in-
differently and in vicious independence of each other.
Their agency for misrule in the regulation of the thorough-
fares the Report denominates the Vestral element. But,
inasmuch as parochial maladministration is mainly self-
ish, ought it not rather to be called, in the aggregate,
the Nostral element? Chemically, that element might
be styled Bumbleine.
REGIMENTS nr TUB Rinr.—BOTH the gallant troops at
Aldershott, and Volunteers at Wimbledon, have given their
country good earnest of their conduct in the face of an
enemy. No doubt they would behave as well under fire
as they have been lately behaving under water.
Duke of York (Waterloo Place). Ha, ha, ha! I can't help
laughing when I look at you poor devils down there in the fog.
What has poor BYRON done that he should be brought down to your
level? If they must give him a statue, better give it a lift—well
out of sight—like mine.
Viscount Nelson. No, no—must be a Sailor, your Royal Highness,
reallj to like going aloft. I don't believe your Royal Highness is
particularly comfortable up there.
Duke of York. Nonsense, my Lord. I consider myself the most
fortunate statue in London—no one owes so much—
George the Fourth. Gad, that's true, Bishop!
Duke of York. Hang your wit, GEORGE. How about your own
bills?—Owes'so much to his situation, I was going to say. I stand
here on my capital—
George the Fourth (sotto race). Tour creditors', that is—
Duke of York. Above the smother of the London fog, beyond the
fire of contempt, and out of the range of criticism! Which of you,

HYMN AGAINST HUMBUG.
IN a letter to the Times on the American Revivalists the REV.
CHAKLES N. EDGINGTON animadverts on "one essential oharateristic
of ME. MOODY'S teaching," to wit, "his persistent preaching of
religion without righteousness." There appears to be a good deal
of that religion in America, and perhaps we have not a little
amongst ourselves. Let us hope that little has not been increased
by the preaching of MB. MOODY. Indeed Ma. EDGINOTON, in arguing
that it has, adduces a quotation which may be thought to prove the
reverse. Speaking of MK. MOODY'S sermons in general, he observes:
"The burden of his song is expressed in the Revivalist hymn, which
waa one of his collection,—
'Doing is a deadly thing;
Doing ends in death.'"
When we consider how many hearers of MESSRS. MOODY AND
SANKEY were retail shop-keepers, too probably in the habit of
"knowingly" practising adulteration, and using false weights and
measures, we may descry a possibility that the burden of MR.
MOODY'S sermon, and ME. SANKEY'S hymn, has impressed with
the fatal consequences of "doing" some converts, who, before
their conversion, did whomsoever they could, and without any
sense that " doing" was otherwise than part of the whole duty of
(shop-keeping) man.

SOMETHING LIKE AN EXPEDITION.
(A Circular translated from the Russian.)
- THE Russian Government, always anxious to spread the blessings
of civilisation in every quarter of the globe, beg to inform the
World in general and Great Britain in particular, that the Expedi-
tion recently dispatched to Central Asia lias been organised merely
and entirely with a view to advancing the interests of Science and
Art.
The Artillery (when not engaged in action) will seize every oppor-
tunity of collecting geological specimens from the breaches made in
the fortresses captured on the line of march. •
The Engineers will be careful to mark in the maps of the countries
through which they may pass all hills, forts, rivers, stockades, and
military stations they may find en route, so that the charts may
subsequently prove of the utmost utility to the men of science, on
whose behalf principally they will have been prepared.
The Infantry will preserve the skeletons of the strange beasts
they may shoot down in the course of an engagement, for presenta-
tion to the Anatomical Museum at St. Petersburg.
The Cavalry will burn villages that have been built without taste,
so that towns of more refined architectural character may be built
on their sites.
That Central Asia may be thoroughly examined from a scientific
point of view, the country may have to be occupied for an indefinite
time. Should this expedition prove successful, a similar experi-
ment will be made in Afghanistan and the other provinces inter-
vening between the Russian frontier.

Of greed that, ghoul-like, feeds from watery graves,
Of homes and hearts that desolate abide,
Of brave men's lives foredoomed for gain of knaves—
And, so denouncing, Hunt? his charges wide,
And gave his enemies a scoff and boast,

Still let his bitter cry ring in our ears—

CABMAN EXTRAORDINARY.
IT is not always that Virtue is its own reward, and gets no other.
At the Middlesex Sessions, the other day, one JOHK MORRIS, a
shoemaker, who had stolen a purse containing £1 10s., the property
of GEORGE HARDWICKE, from his person, was brought to justice.
This satisfactory result was owing to the exceptional courage, steadi-
ness, energy, and self-denial—if not honesty—of a certain cabman,
badge 5665, living at No. 17, Great Warner Street, Clerkenwell.
The offence was committed on the person of an old gentleman taken
into 5665's cab. The old gentleman was drunk and incapable. He
and the prisoner together were taken into the cab at Cockepur
Street, and 5665 was directed to drive them to Moring's Hotel,
Dean Street, Soho. Suspecting the old gentleman's companion,
5665 on the way was led to lift the trap on the top of the cab, and
peep in, to see what he was about. That, he perceived, was picking
the old gentleman's trousers' pocket. Thence the prisoner extracted
a purse of gold. He transferred it to the pocket of his own waist-
coat. Cabman 5665 called out to the prisoner that he was robbing
the man. The prisoner offered him a dollar to pull up short of, or
beyond, Moring's Hotel. The Cabman indignantly refused the bribe,
and threatened the thief that he would give him in charge. Here-
upon, the thief jumped out and bolted—5665 after him, leaving his
cab in the street, unattended. When he came up with him, the thief
threatened violence if he followed further, and 5665 saying he would
do so, struck him a violent blow in the face. The Cabman, showing
tight, the thief took to his heels.
"It's no use your attempting to get away," said 5665, "for
wherever you go I'll follow you."
He accordingly followed him through several streets about Soho
for nearly half-an-hour. At length a policeman was found. What
a wonder! The prisoner of course was collared.
In the meanwhile 5665's oab had stood where he left it, taking
care of itself. After a long search it was found with the old
gentleman safe inside. There is a sweet little cherub that takes
care of drunken men and fools. "The prisoner expressed his
willingness to go to the station-house, but wished to go there in the
cab with the prosecutor." But—
'•The cabman appeared to hare had considerable acutenew here, for he
told the policeman that if he vat allowed to go in the cab with the prosecutor
alone, there was no doubt that he would put back into hit pocket the money
be had stolen from him."
No less downy than valiant and true. The thief having been
found guilty, the true man received at least some recompense
besides that to which virtue is proverbially limited. The Assistant-
Judge then ordered him to stand forward, and said that "the
Grand Jury by their presentment had expressed their high approba-
tion of his conduct, and of his great energy and skill in apprehend-
ing the prisoner." The Judge added that—
"He had much pleasure in endorsing their approval, and should order him
to receive a reward of £2, in addition to his ordinary expenses."
Virtue thus, for once in the way, got £2 reward in addition to its
own. It remains only to state the name of the gallant, resolute,
and honest Cabman, 5665. He is named SAMUEL ISAACS. There!
And we should not be surprised to hear that he had a hooked nose.
This is only a surmise; but we mention it in order to take an oppor-
tunity of doing all possible justice to hook-nose gentlemen 01 the
name of ISAACS.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Pie

OOK Ir'ish
Peers I LOHD
BKAUCHAMP
informed the
Lords (Hfim-
day, July 26)
that HER
MAJESTY did
not mean to
interfere between them and the
wicked will of their cruel brethren
of the Upper House.
Prince Edward's Island (Loan
CARNARVON tells us) was raffled for
over here, in lots of 20,000 acres,
more than a hundred years ago.
The present freeholders of the Island
represent the absentee winners of
these lots. Naturally enough, the
resident tenants have long kicked
at paying them rents; and, holding the best cards
in the Local Parliament, have at length, after a pro-
tracted squabble, forced on the Legislature of the
Dominion a Bill for enforcing compulsory sales by
the proprietors. The Governor-General thinks it
best for all parties to sanction the Bill, which
appoints three Commissioners (the one of the
Governor-General's appointment being "our" ME.
CUILDEKS) to assess the compensation prices to be
paid the ousted proprietors. LORD DUFFERIN and
his nominee may be trusted to make the best terms for the proprietors that the case admits,
and to sanction no arrangement glaringly unjust to them. All parties (proprietors included)
will be BO much the better for the healing of an old raw, that the proprietors and their
friends will, probably, be wise not to haggle over the conditions—though they may not get
all they think justice. The tenants, probably, don't quite see it as they do.
LOBD STRATHEDEN is a pertinacious person, with no sense of humour, who will insist on
poking into awkward questions in a way very troublesome to the Foreign Office. At present,
he wants to know if LORD DEBBY has not been putting the national dignity in his pocket,
and knocking under to the three great northern Powers, in re those troublesome Roumanian
provinces, with which Austria, Russia, and Germany have concluded commercial treaties, as
if they were Sovereign, not suzerain, States. The Porte says the provinces have no right to
conclude such treaties without leave of the SULTAN, and LOBD DERBY admits as much.
Austria, Germany, and Russia do not see the need of the SULTAN'S leave being asked. The
Porte says, "Only let the Powers ask leave for the Provinces to conclude such treaties on
their own hook, and we will issue a firman to that effect," and begs LORD DEBUT to back up
the SULTAN in insisting on his right to at least so much show of diplomatic deference. LORD
DERBY- submits the suggestion to.COUNT MONSTER, with a friendly " Come, can't you oblige
the poor dear SULTAN?" COUNT MUNSTER, with a masterly inactivity, feels no more bound
to favour LORD DERBY with an answer than the SULTAN with a request for a firman, and
LORD DEBBT, after waiting a week, recommends the Porte to issue a firman, without
waiting to be asked for it. The Porte declines, and its Foreign Secretary may be asking
LORD DERBY, not without reason, "Call you this backing of your friends?"
But when these very big Powers will have their way, what is left for poor little England
(in LOBD DERBY'S hands), but to knock under; and after all, this is only a diplomatic snub,
and JOHN BULL does not get savage over snubs in diplomacy. He waits till the row
begins. Quite time for him to get his blood up when he sees the red rag, or smells powder.
"A stitch in time does not save nine" in Foreign Office correspondence.
Labour Laws Bill read a Second time, after LORD CAIRNS had tried his hand at a final
tinkering of the Penal Clause which MR. LOWE and MB. CROSS have so failed to make a good
job of.
Query if LORD CAIRNS have not left the quibble-pegs as big as ever.
(Commons.} The undertow of MR, PLIMSOLI'S out-of-doors wave of popularity evidently
sweeping the House strong in the direction of Merchant Shipping Legislation.
AlR, ROEBUCK moved the Second Reading of MR. PLIMSOLL'S Bill for Thursday.
SIR C. ADDERLEY gave notice of the Government Stop-Gap Bill (hurriedly knocked up to
block PLIMSOLL'S) for Wednesday. MR. DILLWYW gave notice of a motion for precedence
for MR. PLIMSOLL'S Bill on Thursday.
Sj.vinz3 Bank Bill, Rivers Pollution
Bill, Offences Against the Person Bill,
sacrificed by their Parliamentary Parents.
If only they would not give reasons. But
when MR. CROSS talks in a breath of " paniu
legislation," and the mass of information
from Judges, Stipendiaries, Chief Con-
stables, &c., English and Scotch, on which
his withdrawn Bill was founded, he is
performing LORD CASTLEREAGH'S famous
teat of "flying in his own face." Why not
manfully confess the truth, that the Bill is
a bungle, and better withdrawn?
MR. HARDT, Punch is glad to hear, does
not mean to throw on officers and men 1 h--
cost of making good the damages caused
by .Summer Manoeuvres and St. Swithin
together to uniforms and accoutrements.
Then the House plunged into the sea of
the Agricultural Holdings Bill; and of the
cheerful subject of Manures and the effect a
thereof, "found no end, in wandering
mazes lost," till nearly three in the morn-
ing.
Tuesday.—A whiff of the Plimsoll breeze
ruffled the smooth waters of the Upper
House! LOBD CAHLIKOFORD wigged the
Government for their abandonment of the
Merchant Shipping Bill, for which they
were now about to "do penance" (see
Mr. Punch'* Cartoon) by what he feareii
would prove "hasty, wild, and bad"
legislation.
MR. PISKAELI'S defence was undertaken
by LORD MALITESBURY and LORD CAIRNS—
impar congretsut.
(Commont.) Morning Sitting devoted to
smoothing the way for MR. PLIMSOLL'S
apology on Thursday, and to securing the
introduction of the Government Stop-Gap
Bill to-morrow, in time for some detailed
information as to its contents.
In the Evening, the House up to its neck
in the dung heap till nearly two.
Wednesday.—After a few hours on Agri-
cultural Holdings BUI, in which an attempt
to limit freedom of contract (on motion of
M u. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN) was defeated
by ITS to 116, SIR CHARLES ADDEBLEY—the
Whipping-boy of the Government, for its
big sin of the Session,—rose to take his
punishment meekly, after his manner.
Judiciously blinking the fact that, but for
the universal voice of popular indignation,
the Stop-Gap Bill would? never have been
beard of, he proceeded to describe its
meagre features,—yet harsh as they are
meagre. It will authorize the Board of
Trade to appoint surveyors, armed with the
Full powers of the Board to stop ships they
have reason to believe unseaworthy, whether
from improper loading or otherwise, and
will empower one-fourth of a crew to com-
plain of unseaworthiness, without giving
security for costs, or the preliminary deser-
tion of any of their number. SIR CHARLES
gave statistics strongly corroborating the
worst MR. PLIMSOLL has charged against
ship-knackers and coffin-ship-owners, and
striking away all justification of the
Government which abandons a measure
called for by malpractices involving such
risk and sacrifice of life.
He did not state how many of the deten-
tions of unseaworthy ships by his Board
were due to PLIMSOLL'S persistent poking
up.
.No man need wish to see his worst
enemy in a more humiliating position than
the Head of Her Majesty's Government has
made for himself in this matter. Punch
will not aggravate his penance, or embitter
his humble-pie. He hates hitting a man
when he is do wo.
MR. GOSCHEN, in tempered terms, pointed
the moral of the moment, and complained.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
as did everybody who spoke with any weight of knowledge, of the
insufficiency of the Bill as described.
Mi. REED announced his intention of supplementing its de-
ficiencies, by so much, at least, of MB. PLIMSOLL'S Bill as prohibits
deck-loads and the stowage of (Train cargoes in bulk—two of the
most common causes of wreck in winter. JOHN BULL and Jack
Tar may not be able to get more, but, as the Cheap Jacks say,
they " will positively take no less."
Thursday (Lords).—Labour Bills got through at last, with the
LOHD CHANCELLOR'S last touch to that crux of a clause which
attempts the definition, of offences in the nature of pioketting, or
rattening.
(Cowimoru.) A perceptible marine flavour pervading the House.
Questions as to cases of unseaworthiness flying about. The House
artistically wrought up for the appearance of MB. PLIMSOLL in the
character of apologist, which he performed in a manly and digni-
fied fashion, but with a due reserve, withdrawing and apologising
for all such terms and expressions as were in transgression of Par-
liamentary usage, but not withdrawing any statement of fact.
MR. DISRAELI received the apology, so becomingly ottered, in a
manner as becoming—and with a graceful (apparent) unconscious-
ness of the fact that it was the Government's abandonment of the
Bill on which MB. PLIMSOLL had set hit hopes of ameliorating the lot
of the merchant seaman that had led to the offence for which, as the
representative of the House, he now accepted the offender's apology.
Mow do the maker and the acceptor of that apology respectively
stand at this moment in the estimation of the country?
MB. BENTINCK and MB. NSWDBQATE expressed themselves not
quite so satisfied with the apology as MB. DISU.VKLI. They wanted
a further withdrawal of all charges implicating honourable Member*.
MB. PLIMSOLL may safely gay his charges were never meant to
include honourable Members.
Before getting to Agricultural Holdings, MB. DELLWTN made an
ill-advised attempt to force Government to take up Ma. PLIMSOI.I.'S
Bill, and complaining of Government waste of time, laid himself
open to a well-planted " counter " from MB. DISUAELI.
The House was drifting into personalities, when MB. LEWIS
stopped it by announcing MB. PLIMSOLL'S wish, that his Bill should
give place to the Government measure, to which MR. RIKD an-
nounced his intention to tack certain of the clauses from MB.
PUMSOLL'S Bill, for the prohibition of deck-loads and stowage of
grain in bulk, and perhaps for a compulsory load line. Then the
House plunged once more, with apparent enjoyment, into the marshy
waste of the Agricultural Holdings Bill.
Friday (Lords).—The evils of our own old unregulated system of
Factory labour are growing up with the growth of the Cotton manu-
facture in India. LOUD SHAFTESBURY does well to call attention to
them. We are glad to hear from LOBD SALISBURY that Govern-
ment have their eye on the Indian factories—are aware of the
gradual growth of over-work and oppression of Indian innocents,
and mean to do their best to put them down. Their difficulty is
the native notion that all we do to protect Indian women and
children in the cotton factories is a hypocritical sham, meant to
mask our determination to sustain Manchester factories against
Indian competition.
SIB JOSEPH WHITWOBTH has not only given £3000 a year to
found scholarships in mechanics and the cognate sciences, but
wishes to hand over to the nation an estate of that value for their
perpetual endowment. He sets as good an example in his way of
giving as in his gifts, for he empowers Parliament at any time to
overhaul ,his foundation and bequest. There can be no objection to
relaxing the Mortmain Acts for the purposes of this wise and
munificent act of public spirit. For this the LOBD CHANCELLOR
now introduces the necessary Bill.
(Commons). Morning Sitting on the Stop-Gap Shipping Bfll. A
very practical morning's work, creditable to everybody concerned.
Government, by SIB STAFFOBD NOBTHCOTE, agrees to allow of the
discussion—presumably with a view to acceptance—of grain-cargo
and deck-load clauses, but objects to doing as much for clauses
securing compulsory survey and load-line. MB. REED will have a
fight for their introduction. MB. PLIMSOLL and MB. GOSCHEN want
fall discussion, at least, of these clauses. MB. DISRAELI made one
of those masterly changes of front which leave us all so proud of
the tactician, whatever we may think of the statesman or legislator.
By a dexterous twist he gives his penitential sheet the hang of a
triumphal robe; and calmly and complacently thanks the public for
the roar of execration which has " assisted" the Government to bring
in its Stop-Gap Bill!
Now this is is really clever.
Before the House got to Merchant Shipping, a merchant shipper,
MB. BATES, the Member fur Plymouth, very properly asked tor a
Select Committee to inquire into the charge MB. PLIMSOLL, by
implication, at least, brought against him of being a "ship-
knacker."
MR. PLIMSOLL'S worst fault as a strategist is his readiness to
make and endorse specific accusations. It shows his good faith as
a man, but gives a powerful handle against him as a Parliamen-
tary tactician. Dirt flung in the House is pretty sure to splash back
in the face of the flinger. Bettor overlook it than stoop for it, in
nine cases out of ten.
n

THE WRONGS OF WOMEN.
OURTEOUS MR. PUITCH,
I TRUST that your
known gallantry and gen-
tlemanly interest in the
•wrongs of Suffering Hu-
manity—or, I might even
say, Womanity—will in-
duce you to spare a very
tiny little of your valuable
space for the insertion of
this paragraph, which I
read lately in my news-
paper:—
"Originally, ladies were
eligible to become members
of the Order of the Garter.
HINBY THB EIGHTH decreed
that they should no longer
enjoythii privilege. CHARLES
THE FIB&T and GEOKQB THE
SECOND proposed to restore the
old arrangement, but tile pro-
ject is both cases was never
executed. After they shall
hare attained the Parliamen-
tary franchise, women may agi-
tate for the reiteration of their
ancient right to hare the Gar-
ter bestowed npon the wealthy
or weU-bora of their sex."
I fear extremely that a sneer is latent in these last few words,
though wherefore this should be so I am puzzled to imagine. Why
should not we poor women have the franchise granted to us, and the
Garter also, if we so desire it? Why should honours such as these
be reserved for only men, and we who pay our coal bills and our gas
and taxes are not so much as suffered to sit upon a Jury P
Hoping somebody in Parliament will be chivalrous enough to take
the matter up, and get our ancient rights restored to us, believe me,
Mr. Punch, your weekly reader and adorer,
Minerva Cottage, Friday. SOPHONISBA SMITH.
P.S.—That monster HENBY THE EIGHTH! I always have detested
him, and now I 'm sure we Ladies all must hate him more ferociously
than ever.
THE SEEYANTS' COLLEGE.
MB. PTWCH rejoices to hear that " the greatest plague of life" has
a slight chance of being abated by the establishment of a College
for Servants, who will be educated in the most careful way to do
justice to their employers—the main idea being that most lucidly
stated by the Dean of Saint Patrick's, that it is the chief duty of
every Servant to ascertain the full amount of his master's income, and
to spend the whole of it on his own department. Having been
favoured with an early copy of the subjects with which the courses
will commence, Mr. Punch is glad to give to this useful undertaking
the advantage of his world-wide publicity.
CLASS 1. Lady Housekeepers.—" How to manage a Widower with
young Children. In three heads: 1, Domestication; 2, Flirtation;
3, Temptation."
CLASS 2. Cooks.—" How to make the Kitchen-fire too hot for the
Missus, and too cool for the Sirloin."
CLASS 3. Sutlers.—" How to substitute Marsala for Madeira, and
Vin Ordinaire for Chateau-Lafitte."
CLASS 4. Lady's-Maids.—" How to look much prettier than the
young ladies when there are visitors in the house.
CLASS 5. Footmen.—" How to make a fortune out of six feet two
in height, and calves nineteen inches round."
CLASS 6. Men and Wives.—" How to keep their quarrels to them-
selves, and feed their ' inoumbranoes' in the neighbourhood."
CLASS 7. Coachmen and Grooms.—" How to make the corn sup-
plied to the stables more useful than if wasted on dumb animals."
CLASS 8. Housemaidt. — "How to train that noble animal, the
harmless necessary cat, to break glass and snap up unconsidered
trifles."
It can scarcely be doubted, from this preliminary syllabus of
lectures, that the new Institution will do much for the comfort,
economy, and refinement of our households.

You are getting most iconoclastic,
You mannikiu mortals, but this is too strong—
A new dose of dogma exceedingly drastic
Such sceptical laxness will call for ere long.
Tradition and Tale you have turned topsy-turvey,
But this last attempt to out me from your creed
Is far worse than wicked—it's stupid and scurvy,
Although—please the parsons!—it shall not succeed.

Of course the old Mulciber fibbed I—with my nose.

Compared with this insult from Clifton that comes;
I swear indignation my voice fairly stifles
When I hear myself branded as chief of the Hums!
Ah, JENKINS of Clifton! your future my care is!
You think me—0 Lucifer, here is a fall 1—
A sort of a swart subterrene Mrs. Harris,
And doubt if there's " any sich person at all!"
If seeing's believing—aha!—but no matter,
The parsons plus Pn i LLFMORF, bay on your track,
A victim to clerical chasing and clatter,
Might envy AoUeon his peaoefuller pack.
I'm safe, for the orthodox can't do without me,
The sine qua non of their Church and their creed.
To serve me would shock them far less than to doubt me,
To Niebnhrise me were destructive indeed.
I 'm the parson's own pet, and these reckless attackers
Of me will find them at their heels double quick,
With the sinners for thralls, and the saintly for backers,
A fico for JENKINS 1 Yours gaily,

NONAGE AND DOTAGE.
AT the Maidstone Assizes, the other day, a British Jury, on a
case of breach of promise of marriage, actually found a verdict for
the defendant. But they had no choice. Defendant's Counsel
pleaded infancy, and proved his client to be under twenty. The
learned gentleman argued "that an infant was only liable for
necessaries supplied to him," and that "marriage could not be
treated as a necessary"; and JUDGE DENMAN put the question of
infancy as the only one to be tried. It is quite clear that a wife
cannot be a necessary anyhow for an infant, unless a very forward
one, but a nurse may and generally is. Sometimes the defendant in
a breach of promise case is an old man in his second childhood, who,
if he wants a wife at all, wants her only as a nurse. On behalf ot
an aged ninny in cases of this description, would it not be advisable
to legalise the plea of infancy f

THE Alphonists, by not cutting off supplies from the Carlists in
their retreats, have been said to have given them a modus vivendi.
They seem to have rectified that mistake by active measures through
which they are giving their adversaries a modus moriendi.

A CITY MAYOR'S NEST.
LACE— The Guildhall. TIME
—An hour before the
dawn on the 2nd of
August, 1875. Goo, the
S'ant of Progress, and
AGOG, the symbol of
Statu Quo, ditcovered on
Guard.
Gog. "Well, Brother, I
trust you are pleased. I
really think the Inter-
national Demonstration
(taken as a whole) has
been a great success.
Don't you think so too?
Magog. "Well, it wasn't
so werry bad. It won wot
I call a himmertation —
something like that there
feed we 'ad when the
furreign Snff'rings came
Citywards in the beginning
of this 'ere new-fangled
oent'ry.
Gog. My dear Brother,
pray call their Majesties
—Sovereigns. Look to
your pronunciation, my
good fellow, look to your
pronunciation.
Magog. I tell yer wot it is—you leave my grammar alone, can't
yer! Although you 've taken up with the new style, I tell yer I
'old with the old. At the beginning of this 'ere new-fangled
cent'ry we called 'em " Buff'rings."
Gog. My dear fellow, we need not quarrel. I have no doubt
(when I take into consideration the crushes at the old City banquets)
that " Suffering " was not an inappropriate title.
Magog. An inner—wot? I tell yer what it is, Goo. I don't under-
stand 'alf yer say. You 've grown so werry fine of late years, that
there's no knowing yer! "Wot's come over yer?
Gog. I have merely marched with the Spirit of the Age. There
is nothing absurd about an Alderman now-a-days.
Magog. Well, there never was, was there?
Gog. My dear Brother, you have the entrfe to the City Library.
I will give you a reply by asking a question. Have you ever looked
at the back numbers of the periodical published at the Office of the
Greatest Sage of this and any other century?
Magog. You mean Mr. Punch. In course I 'ave. "Who ain't?
Gog. Pray use the aspirate, my dear Brother. You positively
shock me. Your education must have been sadly neglected.
Magog. Neglected indeed! Now I tell you wot it is, don't you
begin a chaffing me about my haches, cos I won't stand it.
Gog. I apologise. Let us change the subject. To return, you
must have been pleased with the International gathering. It was
better, far better, than the banquet given to the Allied Sovereigns,
because it was held in the honour of peace. It was a congress of
doves.
Magog. Eight you are—turtle doves!
Gog. You are pleased to be facetious I But was not the sight
most gratifying? Did it not prove that Municipal Government had
received a new lease of power and popularity?
Magog. Guver'ment, indeed! A lot of guver'ment we 'ave in
the City now-a-days! Why, 'aven't we been obligated to give up
almost everythink? Didn't they make us turn Smiifel into a
butcher's shop? didn't they meddle and muddle with the Thames?
and 'aven't they put dbwn the men in brass? A coming into the
City and turning of everythink upside down!
Gog. I am delighted to say that everything that was capable of
improvement twenty years ago is now greatly improved. The LOUD
MAYOB OF LONDOJT is no longer the laughing-stock of the whole
nation.
Magog. And why shouldn't he be?
Gog. Because he has taken his proper place. He is the National
Host, and the Head of Public Philanthropy.
( Magog. Fine words butter no parsnips f I like the old style best.
Give me the days when the LOBD MAYOB and the Corporation did
nothing but heat and drink and go to sleep in the Justice Room of
the Mansion 'Ouse!
Gog. My dear Brother, I fear your tastes are unrefined.
Magog. I s'pose yer means "low." Low, yerself! Who husks
scribblers and hartists, and such like chaps, to dinner nowadays?
Yah I
Gog. I rejoice to say that after many years of " black neglect" (I
quote from a recent speech of that distinguished novelist MB.
DISRAELI), the City has redeemed its reputation by recognising the
claim of Genius to share the honours bestowed upon the Soldier and
the King.
Magog. Well, if that aint low, I don't know wot is! Bat it's too
'ot for rows. Let's go to Margate awhile nobody's looking.
Gog. Margate!
Magog. 0, don't you be shocked. It's quite genteel now. Don't
yer know as 'ow the Prince took 'is wife (bless 'er sweet face and
kind 'eart!) with 'im the other day. Where 'is Ry'l Ugliness can

Gog. Well, really, 1 should like a little sea-air. Do you think
we could get away without attracting attention to our departure?
Magog. In course we can! Now, then, down yer comes! 'Old
'ard! Get back!—just our luck!—'ere comes a Peeler! We must
wait for another hopertoonity!

were still on guard, and London slept in peace.
A SAINTS WARNING.
YOUB Meteorologists may refer the late rains and floods to natural
causes, but the truly weather-wise will know what to think when
they read the subjoined extract from a Hampshire journal—the
Andover Advertiser:—
"A startling rumour has lately been current in this county to the effect
that the authorities of the Cathedral are about to disturb the repose of
St. Switbin, by either removing the slab which is dedicated to him in the
Presbytery, or by placing on the top of it the proposed cenotaph of BISHOP
SOSUJEB.
It may be that this report is unfounded, for the deluge on
St. Swithin's Day, and the subsequent floods, have been followed
by some fine harvest weather. Or perhaps the authorities of Win-
chester Cathedral have abandoned a vile intention. But in so far
as they are the same as those who, a few years since, turned the
bones of RUFUS out of his grave, because towards the end of eight
centuries they discovered that the tomb over it stood in the way,
they are capable of anything. To be sure Swithin as saint had the
advantage of RUTUS as Sinner. On the other hand, BISHOP STJILNEU
has the better of St. Swithin, by his reign of forty years to the
Saint's of forty days.
Offence may also have been given to St. Swithin by the sale of
Winchester House, and by the enlargement of the new diocese of
Rochester, through the diminution of the old one of Win-
chester, now shorn of Putney, Mortlake, Wimbledon, Richmond,
and Eingston-on-Thames. The Saint may have resented this
curtailment of his old domains by throwing cold water upon that
proceeding. However, his wrath seems to have abated; at least,
his waters have. Should the former rekindle, and the latter be
renewed, perhaps, with the view of appeasing St. Swithin, devotees
at the approaching season, instead of going to Lourdes or Paray-
le-Monial, might make a pilgrimage to Winchester. They would
be heartily welcomed there by the tradesmen and licensed victuallers.
But as it is an ill wind that blows, so it is bad weather that
brings, nobody good. If St. Swithin, as successor to Jupiter
Pluvius, is injurious to the farmer, he is gracious to the myoolo-
list and myoophagist. If he drowns the hay and wheat, he
quickens the mushrooms and toadstools. Among these last, Mr.
Punch is told, there is an esculent variety sacred to a Saint—the
St. George's agaric,—which comes up on or about St. George's Day.
But the Patron Saint of fungi and their eaters at large is clearly
St. Swithin. In this connection it is remarkable that the general
form of mushrooms is that of an umbrella.
NEW NAVAL MONSTER.
Trre last new thing in naval architecture is a Russian novelty,
the Novgorod, designed by ADMXBAL POPOFF, and highly commended
in the Times by a no less authority than MB. E. J. REED. She
carries armour eleven inches thick and guns of twenty-eight tons,
goes eight knots an hour, has steamed from Nioolaieff round the
south of the Crimea to the Circassian coast, thence back as far as
Sebastopol, then on to Odessa, and lastly into the Sea of Azoff,
through the Straits of Eertoh in a depth of only fourteen feet of
water. The Novgorod is described as a "Circular Ironclad." She
does rather fast work for a sort of vessel that our old naval heroes
would have styled a saucepan and a tub. In another kind of
phraseology than the purely nautical, to wit, the horsey, or, so to
speak, the horse-marine, she might be said to be "a rum 'un to
look at but a good 'un to go," and the Admiralty might as well
perhaps consider the possibility that the Novgorod might some day
prove an ugly customer.

It isn't turbot, it 's brill, dear,
And I hope that you '11 find it nice;
And give me a chair, my poppet,

On my forehead before I sink;
And open the window wider,

And order a cup of cider,

And where is the cool silk jacket

And I think that I '11 take a nap, dear,

And bring me my smoking-oap, dear,

That in future we '11 promise not
To complain of the chilling winds, pet,

City Sports.
FOR some years past the all-absorbing
amusement east of Temple Bar has been
Kite-flying. Fashions will change, how-
ever, and this pastime has had to cede the
palm lately to some very smart Cricket-
ing, — in which many of the most success-
ful Kite-flyers only came oif second-best.
Several of them were soon stumped— some
experiencing a difficulty in finding their
bails after they were bowled over.
On the side of the field, both long and
short slips were found at the Banks— by no
means their proper places. In some games
leg was not square, and in one case he dis-
appeared with the bail. The most effective
bowling has been that of a Young hand,
who has made several good catches, and
seems the only player likely to reap at the
same time honour and profit from the late
City games.
A BAG OF THICKS!
PROFESSOR DISRAELI, Wizard of the East, Inventor of the "Asian
Mystery," &o.. &c., presents his compliments to the Members of both
Houses of Parliament and the Public generally, and begs to state
that he has recently added the following amusing tricks to his
already extensive repertoire of Political llitisiona:—
The Magic Mess.
The Professor will take a dozen first-rate Bills (collected hap-
hazard from the ranks of the Ministry), and after allowing them to
grow to an extraordinary size, will cause them to vanish, by the
waving of a pen, into thin air. In the place of the dozen first-rate
mils will be found a small and unpopular Measure of the Professor's
own construction.
The Phantom Paper.
. In this trick the Professor will take a popular Bill and destroy it
in the presence of the Public. A storm will immediately arise,
upon which the Professor will speedily restore the Bill to what (the
* ublic will believe) was its original condition.
The Changeable Order Book.
The Professor will cause the names of a number of Bills to appear
roi the pages of an Order Book. He will invite the World to get
nd of them, and the invitation will not be accepted. Suddenly
When least expected) the page, at the Professor's command, will
become a blank.
The Perplexed Party.
The Professor will hold up a number of Measures before a Party,
and will ask for the colour of the Measures. The reply of the Party
will be "black." Immediately the Professor will prove that the
Measures are " white," to the astonishment of all beholders.
Sound versus Vapour.
The Professor will take the Queen's Speech and pass it round for
inspection. It will be found to contain a large number of promises.
By an effort of will, the Professor will change all the promises into
smoke.
The Vanishing Majority.
This remarkable feat (in which nearly seventy_vqtes will be made
to disappear in the most extraordinary manner) is in. active prepa-
ration, and will probably; be exhibited in the House of Commons
shortly after the completion of the Recess.
The Professor pledges himself to perform the last-mentioned feat
in a third of the time consumed in its accomplishment by his pre-
decessor, DR. WILLIAM EWABT GLADSTONE.
On a Proposed Abandonment.
To massacre the Innocents,
We know's a sad affair;
But throwing Sailors overboard
Was more than we could bear.

JOHN'S BAD DREAM.
JOHN BULL he sat in the Summer dusk,
And brooded o'er his Times;
The air was sweet with the rose's musk,
And a sea-breeze shook the limes.
Bnt his heart was hot. "I've a precious lot
Of bunglers," murmured he,
Or things better would thrive, 'twiit dead and alive,
On my " Silver Streak of Sea."
"Ha! Ha! Ho.' Ho.'" JOHN looked, and lo 1
A Thing was standing there,
With lantern-jaws, and legs a-bow,
And a tangle of sea-weedy hair.
"Who are you?" quoth JOHW. With a laugh that fell
Like the rattle of dead men's bones,
Quoth the grisly thing, " You should know me well,
For my name is DAVT JOKES!
"A partner I in the shipping firm
That is hight'JOHK BULL & Co.'
I'm the 'Sub-Sea Branch '—'tis the fittest term,
For I manage affairs below!"
"The deuce you do!" cried choleric JOHN.
Said the Spectre, "Don't be rash,

And our interests scarce can clash.

"For they came in hundreds who came in scores,

JOHX BULL awoke from a troubled dream,
And he uttered never a word;
But there was that in his eye's quick gleam
Which showed that his soul was stirred.

Of PLIMSOLL and of

When in personal debates
"Merchant Shipping'1 fettled down.
REID and HUNT fiercely bandying
Fro and eon.;
And SIR WILFRID hand to hand,
'Gainst SIB. STAFFORD making stand,
While BENTINCK, big and bland,
Led them on!
Before getting to such 'serious business (Common*—
Saturday Morning Sitting] as MB, PLTMSOLL'S imputa-
tion and MR. BATES'S refutation, MB, C. LEWIS and the
ATTORNEY-GENERAL had a Email (but troublesome)
bone to pick together. The said SMALLBOUE appears to
be an old rogue who, by proceedings which Mr. Punch
prefers not to characterise in plain—or, rather, ugly—
English, having put his brother's widow to heavy costs,
for which she had a moral but not a legal claim on him, she was com-
pelled to file a bill in Chancery 'against him. The result was that
SMALLBORE was ordered bv the Court to convey to her certain property
which he had "conveyed5' to himself, and to pay some £60 of costs.
To defeat the claim against him, this amiable old gentleman made not
the smallest bones of collusively getting rid of his property, after pro-
viding for the costs of the enterprising attorney who had assisted him in
his equitable litigation. The upshot was that he found himself committed
to prison by the County Court Judge, at the cost of a violation of form,
and, through his own stupidity and that of his lawyer, was kept in
durance eight months. Admitting the irregularity of the sentence
itself, Mr. Punch can only say, "Sarved him right."
The most enterprising and active attorney in the House, Ma. C. LEWIS (M.P. for Londonderry),
has brought the case before the House with professional eagerness to avenge violated form, ana a
natural desire to make the most of his SSIAT.UJONK. The House saw the last of it, it is to be hoped,
on Saturday. ME. LEWIS wants to restrict the County Court Judge's power of committing
fraudulent debtors. Suppose, instead, he were to try his hand at a Bill for restricting Attorneys'
power of cpmmittingthemselves, by bringing or defending fraudulent suits?
CTI Civil Service Estimates, a hawk unnaturally proceeded to pike out hawks' een, DB. CAMEBON
moving to strike off a grant of £200 towards chairs at Edinburgh and St. Andrew's for teachers.
The Scottish Schoolmaster might well have been abroad, and even aghast, at such a violation of
the good old Scottish rule—the simple plan—
"That Scots should get who had the power,
And Scots should keep who can."
DR. PI.ATFAIR rebuked DR. CAMEKON, but the grant was withdrawn from the'Estimate—a
Cross having been set against it.
Then came a very different vote—£454,368 for National Education in Ireland. Where the
National Exchequer gives £85, local contributors only give £14. Luckily the results of little
PATJDBEEK'S schooling are better than the "results" of old PAT'S payments, though even the
best might be better. But JOHN BULL owes PAT a heavy debt for past blundering, oppression, and
injustice, and will do wisely to pay it in the shape of education expenses. What Ireland wants
are better and more loyal National School-teachers. What Irish National School-teachers want
are better houses and better stipends; and we rejoice to know that Government is giving both,
though still with too timid a hand. Even pensions to superannuated teachers are in prospect.
If the "results " of Irish National schooling are not as good as could be wished, both countries
will find better payment by these "results " than any other that is likely to come of money spent
for PAT out of J. B.'s pocket.
And then came regrettable debates in re BATES. The maritime Member for Plymouth, out-
raged by MB. PLIMSOLL'S question if he is, or is not, the MB. BATES who last year figured at a
painfully high figure in the Wreck Register, wants a Select Committee to clear himself of the
imputation which he feels—and, no duubt, rightly feels—to be implied against him, .of ship-
knacking. As far as classification
and insurance returns can clear a
man, MB. BATES has cleared himself,
but wants a Select Committee to go
into the matter, and bring him out
as clean as a man naturally wishes
to stand before the House and the
country, after the shadow of such an
imputation has been flung over him.
MB. Fr.iusoLL is in too excited
and critical a state of health, we
are sorry to hear, to be trusted
with a "personally-conducted" de-
bate, and MB. REED, on whom he
leans, contrived to lisp out a " modut
apologendi" after much heated ques-
tion how far MB. PLIMSOLL had
retracted, how far he was bound
to retract, and much collision of
words and wit, in which the House
took that eager and interested part
which it may be trusted to take in
a personal question. The late Con-
structor of the Navy showed all his
acknowledged cleverness of con-
struction, and his skill in avoiding
misconstruction even by two of its
most belligerent Baronets, SIB W.
I,AWSON and SIB C. BILKS, and some
of its most amiable officials, as LOUD
SANDOW, SIR STAJTOBD NOBTHCOTE,
MB. WABD HUMT, and the Leader of
Her Majesty's Opposition, besides
less minacious outsiders, in the Reso-
lution (accepted nem. con.)—
"That in the opinion of this House,
no stain rests upon the character of the
Honourable Member for Plymouth, in
consequence of the statements made in
this House by the Honourable Member
for Derby on the 22nd of July."
The House has at least shown its
sense by not crowning the waste of
Saturday's discussion t>y the blunder
of a Select Commission for an in-
quiry safe to be more personally
conducted than the most tribulatory
tour of too many Cooks in which
broth was ever spoilt.
Best part of Saturday's morning
sitting was consumed in this hot and
heady fight. It was announced as
a sitting for the [dispatch of busi-
ness. In one sense only business
was dispatched—it was very effec-
tually killed by overlaying with
BATES and PUUSOLL. The only
thing on which the House is to be
congratulated is for not taking its
BATES at his word. It would cer-
tainly have been drawn into a trap.
Monday (Lordi).—Last stages of
a batch of Bills rattled through.
Q. b.f. f. q. t. In plain English,

(Commoni.) A hard night's work,
trying to stop gaps in the Stop-Gap
Merchant Shipping Bill. This BUI
can only be described as "nnsea-
worthy" when it came into the
House, and Punch sorely fears it
will hardly deserve to be called
seaworthy when it comes out.
MB. REED first tried to carry a
Resolution, on going into Commit-
tee, in favour of a load-line, whether
sanctioned or recorded by Govern-
ment. This was only meant to ven-
tilate the load-line point, and the
Resolution was withdrawn when this
had been effected. The real fight
came in Committee when the House
so unmistakably showed its deter-
mination to have some load-line,
that, after opposition from SIB C.

ADDEBLEY, MR. DISRAELI was fain to yield a line to be drawn by the ship-
owner, not the Government. MR. REED then moved the prohibition of deck-
cargoes, but was defeated, after a discussion in which SIR C. ADDEELET anc
Sis STATFORD NORTHCOTE had by no means the best of the argument, by 19"
to 130.
JOHN BULL and Jack Tar both would have good reason to be obliged to thi
House of Lords if they could undo the Commons' work in this matter, though i
is to be feared that there is little chance of it at this fag-end of the Session
Probably the majority felt that, as they had overborne the Government on th(
load-line, and meant to force their hand—MB. DISBAELI calls it "assisting1
them—in stowage of grain-cargoes, they thought it only due to their allegiance
to throw over MB. REED'S deck-load clause.
The upshot of the night's work was to stop two of the leaks in the Bill, am
to leave the third, and perhaps most dangerous, open. But there is an extra
plank or two between poor Jack and death for this winter. Let us hope there
will not be quite so many who go down to the (bottom) of the sea in ships a
usual.
Tuesday (Lords).—Low CABNABVON gave a cheery account of the Gol(
Coast, whose revenue is increasing as it ought to be—pacification going on
steadily, and Slave Trade Abolition Ordinances working well. Conflict of juris
dictions between our settlements and the French at the Gambia are the wors
dangers!
"Satan finds some miachiof still
For idle hands to do."
And when, besides idleness, new rum is cheap, the
hermometer at boiling heat, and swamp-fever waving
ler yellow wings over every un-woolled head within the
margin of that White Man's Grave, the Old Gentleman
3Ught to be having a peculiarly lively time of it.
LORD JOHN, who loves to have his dear old fingers in
jvery pie, came forward with a zeal for poor Jack that
loes honour to his heart, to move an address to HER
IAJESTY to give special directions for every precaution,
letween this and next Session, to preserve the lives of
ur sailors from danger of unseaworthy ships.
Luckily, PLIMSOLL and Parliament together will give
Poor Jack something better than such directions to
rust to.
"Pretty," as PEPTS would say, to see everybody so
ealous for Poor Jack all of a sudden!
(Commons.) SIR C. ADDERLEY formally announced HER
HAJESTT'S intention to issue a Royal Commission on
Copyright. Not before it is wanted. Hitherto, when
one hears of MR. C. READE'B eighteenpenoe and ARCH-
JISHOP WHATELY'S eleven and twopence (was it?) from
,he Pactolus opened for British Authors by Canadian
aw, one cannot feel that, up to this time, whatever else
.hey have got by the sale of their works, they hare got
such a " Royal Commission."
A long and strong fight—MR. SHAW LETETRK heading
;he one force, and MR. HUNT the other—between the
pro and con of competition for Naval Cadetships. Much
lense spoken on both sides.
The Government have determined on doing away with
Competition for the first step in naval service. There is
much to be said against competition as actually con-
ducted, not for Naval Cadetships only, but for Army
Commissions and Civil Service Clerkships. It has been
conducted, as far as Mr. Punch can learn, so as to strain
to the uttermost the case that can be made in its favour.
There is nothing that stands in more need of the con-
stant influence of sound sense and the diplomatic dis-
couragement of pedantry and red-tape. But the remedy
is not to do away with competition—for that means the
re-establishment of jobbery, back-stairs' favour, and
personal influence, and the casting back again into the
cold shade of unfriended ability, and energy that cannot
reach high or low enough for a patron—but the conduct-
ing of it with a sensible regard to the demands of the
Service, and the actual training, natural strength, and
knowledge and reading reasonably to be looked for from
bovs of the age to be examined.
JOHN BULL should look to this, and neither allow Com-
petitive Examination to be discredited by the pedantry
and unwisdom in the misconduct of it, nor the country
to be robbed of the unassisted energy and ability to
which it should open, and was meant to open, a career.
The Battle of the Guns—already fought once this Ses-
sion—opened again by CAPTAIN PRICE. He insists on
experiments to test onr Woolwich " Infants," bigger and
lesser, as they would be tested in action—not with
violet and iris-powder, but villanous sulphur and
saltpetre.
These "Infants" are certainly too dear to be left
without very close looking after. MB. HUNT promised
careful, nay, crucial experiment. •
Wednesday. — Additional Estimates of £417,000.
Dopsoir may gnaw at the .Exchequer file, and welcome,
while SIR STAFFORD is able to announce a rise in
Customs, Excise and Stamps large enough not only
comfortably to cover the big body of Supplementary
Estimates, but to tuck in on each side with a million
margin! To be sure, "there's many a slip between
the cup and the lip"; and only four months of the
twelve are over yet.
MR. GLADSTONE once more donned his favourite
costume^the dark mantle of Jeremiah, Prophet and
Economist—and delivered himself of a wail not only
over the wicked extravagance of JOHN BULL'S house-
hold, but, still more, over JOHN'S own light-hearted
indifference to it. JOHN absolutely declines to work
himself into a wax over any amount of wasted candle-
ends and cheese-parings not fully accounted for.
MR. GLADSTONE has added another to his famous series
of political Triads—" the Three Roads to Ruin of a
Government—to increase expenditure, not to reduce
debt, and never to impose new taxes."

THE ALOERSHOT CAMPAIGN.
Private Sweeny (Highland Rcgrnneitt). "CotONT Boo, is IT t THDT BKDAD! I
WISH 1 WAS BACK IS Tiri'IRARY I"
A WET BIRTHDAY.
Tnu column of Births, Deaths, and Marriages in the
Times, if carefully watched, will often supply food for
serious reflection. Perhaps its latest phenomenon is the
announcement of a birth, with the special intimation
that the interesting little event happened "on the 15th
July (St. Swithin's)."
Births on particular days of the year are frequently
recorded, and the reason is generally self evident. It is
not difficult to understand the degree of parental anxiety
that would be felt concerning the future career of a child
which had the misfortune to be born on the first of April;
and for an infant coming into the world on Michaelmas
Day fears might be reasonably entertained lest it should
turn out a gooee. But what influence St. Swithin can
have, either for good or for evil, on the fortunes of a
child born on the day appropriated to the rainy Saint in
the Calendar, it is not so easy to determine.
The babe, if a boy, might undoubtedly be called
Swithin, or possibly Pluvius (like Tertius, Septimus,
Ootavius, and other appellations of the like description),
but such a name would certainly expose the bearer to
a good deal of unpleasantness during his schooldays, and
it is hard to say what advantage it could be to him at
any period of his life. If a girl, the French name,
Heine, might perhaps be considered appropriate. (For
the contingency of twins we confess we are not pro-
vided.) Whatever sex, however, the child born on St.
Swithin's may be, it will do well to remember, when of
an age to appreciate the moral teachings of poetry, the
line in I,ox<; FELLOW which reminds us that
"Into each life some rain must fall;"
and as it grows up into manhood or womanhood, if it
proves provident and thrifty, and disposed to put by
something against that rainy day which occurs in the
lives of most of us with disagreeable frequency, it will
have no cause to regret having been born on St. Swithin's,
and chronicled in the Times accordingly.
N.B.
Tun Pott contains a favourable notice of the Barney
Prize Essay for 1873, lately published. It may be neces-
sary to inform some of our friends in North Britain that
the Barney Prize Essay is not a treatise on Cremation.
But was not one of MR. GLADSTONE'S late quarrels with his suc-
cessors precisely on the ground of their making too elaborate arrange-
ments for systematic reduction of the National Debt? And we
hardly think JOHN BULL will be easily got to turn on them for not
laying on new taxes.

advertisement in that truly national journal, the Irish Times:—
HAECOTJKT STKBET.
TO BE LET, at 80 guineas par annum, a most desirable HOUSE in
the best part of above street, with ample accommodation for a large
family, having all modern improvements, and in perfect order.
If old-fashioned as well as stupid, they, perhaps, would like the
7mA Times to explain to them what the modern improvements of a
family are, especially seeing that order, and more especially order
in a large family, is at any rate not one of them.
Spotless Character.
A NOTORIOUS Gentleman, who has been in gaol, is reported to Have
said that he had left prison, after having served his sentence, with-
out any stain on his character. Very likely. Some characters are
of such a colour that they never show the dirt.

MR. PUNCH observes that, at the sale by auction of MANDEK'S
Menagerie, whereas a Gorilla brought a hundred and five guineas, a
Russian Bear brought only a sovereign, and an American Wolf
twelve shillings and sixpence! Unhappily, he was unaware of the
intended sale, or he might have purchased those two quadrupeds
to guard his sacred portals against all intruders who plague him
with contributions before they have learnt to spell.
Might not MANDER'S Menagerie sale be followed by an auction at
the Menageries of Maunderers? A few lots may easily be set down
as inviting purchasers, and any experienced Valuer could approxi-
mate to the prices at which they would be knocked down. Here is
an extract from the report, by Mr. Punch's own Prophet:—
Lot 1.—A Chimpanzee from Buckinghamshire, with an original
trick every evening. (£1000.)
Lot 67.—A Roman Boar from Peterborough, warranted to sing as
well as dance. (2|rf.)
Lot 99.—An Amphibious Animal from Carlisle, hitherto unde-
scribed. (5s.)
Lot _i)l.—A Merman, caught off Greenwich, with an axe in his
hand. He was very hard to capture, and was with difficulty pre-
vented from cutting down a large oak in Greenwich Park.
(£16G« fit. Sd.)
Lot 392.—A bigger Laughing Hytena than any yet exhibited,
from the County Cavan. (lid.)
Lot 656.—A Lion, from Stoke-upon-Trent. Yery tame. Has been
taught to shake his mane when sprinkled with dew. (i'/.)
The bidding was not brisk, everyone appearing anxious that the
Lots should be knocked down. Indeed, the Lots were of the same
opinion, as the majority of them knocked themselves down.

THE SEASON SUMMED UP.
By one of its Slaves.

A SEASON of rushing
and straggling
to squeeze
And scramble
through crowds
for the shake of
a hand,
Of nine o'clock din-
ners, and five
o'clock teas;
Of wanting a cab
when not one 'a
on the stand.
A season of wishing;
the Countess of
This
Would ask one to
dinner and not
to adrum;
Of watching at
PRINCE'S some
very fast Miss,
And feeling quite
sure that to
grief she will
come.
A season of coaxing and scheming to get
Invitations to anything out of the way;
Of swearing that never again you will bet,
And of trying to smile as your money you pay.
A season of polo and poker and balls,
Of wet garden-parties—passed, yawning, in-doecs.
A season of making most wearisome calls,
And enduring returns from more wearisome bores.
A season of mirth and success to a few,—
To many a season of failure and pain.
A season of yearning to see something new,
A season of seeking for pleasure in vain.
O Season of SlaveryI why do we shrink
From breaking the fetters that bind us to thee ?—
Good gracious! it's time to be off to the Rink t

MONSIEUR, St. Petersburg, January 1.
I HATE discovered that, twelve years ago, you were good
enough to accuse me of telling an infamous falsehood. I have taken
ten years to obtain a copy of the wretched print in which the libel
appeared. That miserable periodical you edited twelve years ago,
and, if it still exists, you edit it still. You must edit it still, I
repeat, because it is top barbarous to be edited by any one less mean,
less despicable, less dishonourable than yourself! Yon hear me!
The never-to-be-sulneiently-hated journal is, or was, called Le
Gamin de Deux Mondes.
I courteously invite you to explain to me what is the meaning
you attach to the words "infamous" and "falsehood."
I may add, for your information, that recently I strolled into the
cemetery in which is situated the grave of your grandmother. I
(the writer of this letter—you understand) danced upon that grave!

weapons, distance, and conditions. He proposes pistols as the

a part of the conditions. He will meet your Principal, pistol in

be loaded with powder and paper, they must not be loaded with
bullets. His honour (which is far dearer to him than life) demands
this sacrifice 1
The incident must therefore be considered at an end, unless your
Principal accepts our Principal's proposition, which is as follows:
The weapons to be rapiers, the distance four feet, and the condi-
tions to be that the rapiers shall have blades at least three feet long.

that the rapiers, instead of having blades three feet long, should
have no blades at all!

SOCIAL QUESTIONS.
Suggetted for discussion at the Social Science Congress,
IF yon invite to your table the Wife of a Dean, and the Niece of
an Archbishop, which of them do you hold entitled to precedence?
When the Girls and their Mamma remind you of your promise to
let them give a ball, and instead of it you oner them a visit to the
Continent, are you justified in mentally reserving to yourself the
right to take them to Boulogne one day, and back the next by
Calais?
If, when dining at the Club, you chance to come across a dear
old friend of yours, whom you have not met for years, do you con-
sider that the meeting may be held as an excuse for your not going
home till morning?
When you take down a Lady who is an utter stranger to yon, and
who replies in monosyllables to everything you say, are you justified,
before the joint comes, in leaving her to her fate, and offering your
small talk to your left-hand neighbour?
Supposing a young gentleman in the Civil Service earns a salary
(less Income-tax) of two hundred pounds a year, to what expendi-
ture per week ought he in prudence to restrict himself in the way
of (1) gloves, (2) cigars, and (3) button-hole bouquets P
Is there any prospect of solving the vexed question, whether the
Host or Hostess ought to lead the way to dinner?
When you are informed that the Doctor says the children require
change of air, and are told with the same breath that Cook desires
a holiday, and that your study must be painted, what more proof do
you require that the Season is at an end, and that you had better
make your mind up to leave Town within a fortnight P
Weighed in the social scale, which is the lighter fib—to say that
you are indisposed, or that yon are not at home, when your dear
friends the BOHEINGTONS expressly call to see yon P
When you are invited to dine at half-past seven—the at being
underlined with considerable emphasis—do yon think that punctual
eight would really be considered premature for your arrival P
I» it possible for two Ladies of average acquirements to converse
with one another for upwards of five minutes without talking of
their balls, their babies, or their bonnets P
If you happen to meet your friends the SWELLBOBOUGHS in Town
in the middle of September, how much credit is attached to the
pretexts which you mutually advance for being visible P
Supposing that a Gentleman accompany his Wife upon a round of
morning calls, and afterwards is treated to a dinner of cold mutton,
to what revenge in the way of dining at his Club is he socially
entitled?
Do yon consider that an invitation to dine, which has been
declined, on the plea of a previous engagement, is an equivalent for
a dinner which has actually been eaten r
If, while travelling abroad, you chance to stumble on your tailor,
to whom you are in debt, is it wise to greet him affably or to
endeavour not to see him?
If you are asked to what yon know will be a dismal dinner, how
many days do you consider you may wait before replying, in the
hope that something better may prevent your acceptance P
PARSON AND GRAZEER.
Is giving judgment on Keet v. Smith, SIB ROBERT FuiixmoRK
explained that, by law, the Churchyard is the Incumbent's freehold
—subject to the right of parishioners, or strangers dying in the
parish, to simple interment, but no more. He added:—
"Indeed, the Incumbent has the right to pasture animali which do not
injure the bodies interred in the Churchyard, and ever; gravestone, of course,
interferes with that pasture."
The Parson is bound to respect existing gravestones. Bat it
appears that, if he stood on his rights, he might refuse to have any
more set up, and oould, if he chose, devote all the available space
iu the Churchyard to growing meat. He might then advertise, if
he thought it likely to pay. Burial-ground Beef or Churchyard
Mutton. The Reverend Gentleman would thus exhibit himself in a
twofold capacity of Pastor.

COMPABATTVE JUSTICE.
WHY reproduce the " Enormous Gooseberry" at this season when
you can invent an enormity so much more astounding than that as
the one thus reported in the Eastern Morning Newt r—
. OUT A HORSE'S Towous.— JOHN JAMESON, farm-servant
»ith MB. MICHAEL OWBTON, of Harpham, farmer, was charged with pulling
out the tongue of a mare, bis property. Defendant was working in a field
with the mare, which did not please him, in going too fast, as he alleged.
He therefore tied the leading-string on a draw-loop round the horse's tongue,
and, by jerking the string, completely cut out the poor animal's tongue, which
fell to the ground. For this cruel act defendant was committed to the House
of Correction, at Beverley, for three months, to hard labour, and the wages in
ME. OWION'S hands were to be forfeited."
If a wretch had the heart to pull out a horse's tongue, yet could
he have the strength to do it? The idea of such a thing seems absurd,
and the story of it a seasonable, but a shocking, if not a too monstrous
hoax. However, the above paragraph is published under the head
of " Police Intelligence — Dnffield Polioe,"which is not the place in
a paper for seasonable enormities. It can hardly, therefore, but be
horribly true, and Mr. Punch is asked to say if the Reverend Gen-
tleman who has made himself famous on the East Lincolnshire Bench
thought fourteen days' imprisonment and four years in a reforma-
tory not too severe a sentence on SARAH CHANDLER for plucking a
rtower, what punishment does Mr. Punch suppose that he would
have felt bound to award to JOHN JAMESON for plucking out a
horse's tongue? And does not Mr. Punch think that JOHN J AM E-
*o» may think himself a lucky fellow that he lives in the East
Hiding of York, and not in East Lincolnshire? Mr. Punch hardly
knows. A Magistrate capable of passing an uncommonly cruel
sentence on a child for a peccadillo, might, for aught Mr. Punch
knows, have a fellow-feeling for an uncommonly cruel fellow, and
perhaps if Ma. JAMESON had been had up in East Lincolnshire for
pulling a horse's tongue out, then, instead of being punished (as
he ought to have been) with the utmost rigour of the law, he might
have been let off altogether.
PRODIGIOUS 1
THIS is an attractive advertisement in a Sporting Paper :—
TO NOBLEMEN and GENTLEMEN.—TO BE SOLD (by private
arrangement only), a fine FREEHOLD ESTATE, in South Wales,
containing upwards of 700 Acres, with a good family Mansion thereon. The
Property commands, from the local advantages it possesses, a baronetcy, and
a seat in Parliament. First-class Fishing and Shooting. Principals only
treated with. Apply, &c.
What are the "local advantages " of the land? Turnips, mangel-
wurzel, gooseberries, or what? Do these give the title, namely,
for .example, SIR TIMOTHY TURNIPS, Bart., SIR MANGEL-WURZEL,
SIR GREGORY GOOSEBERRY, and so forth? Or do the Fishing and
Shooting give the title, as, again, Snt FRANCIS FISH PHEASANT, SIR
PETER PIKE PARTRIDGE? And then to be able to "command" a
seat in Parliament! I Why, here's a big chance .for DR. KENEALY
and his son AHMED! The Doctor could be the Baronet, and his son
could have a seat in Parliament, next to the Convict-Baronet's
advocate, without a struggle. At all events, it is worthy of imme-
diate attention.

^ ,' TRIBUTE TO AN AGITATOR.
TO THJE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND.
FELLOW-COUHTRYMBir,
TEK Irish have been "celebrating" what they call a
"Centenary " festival in honoor of DANIEL O'CoswELL. • It is de-
scribed ns a " tribute to his memory," and a pretty addition it is to
the tribute which he used to receive under the name of "Ithint."
I have never had any tribute whatever paid me. My "Cente-
nary". occurred in 1862, but nobody then proposed to pay any
"tribute " to my memory. Why, then, have the Irish been paying
tribute on tribute to DAW O'CoNNBii? "01" they §»y, "because
he was nur Great Liberator I" Was I not your Great Liberator,
and a Liberator a precious deal Greater than theirs, though, to be
sure, people never called me a Big BiggarmanP Were not my
writings and speeches the original means which in the end liberated
you from the borough-mongers? I shall be told that my Centenary
has gone by, but that is all the more reason why a tribute which
has been long owing to my memory should now be paid. What
tribute do I want? Not a statue, which is a tribute only fit for
a fellow as Sir AKSJ'EAKE, or such another fellow as BTHON.
c , .
No; pay me a tribute more durable than a thing made of brass,
which will, by-and-by, turn to verdigris. Let your tribute be the
publication of a handsome edition of my works, which everybody
who has read them acknowledges to be the most useful and best
written in the English language. That is the only sort of tribute
for me. Pay me that, and, in so doing, you will render an imperish-
able and everlasting tribute to the memory of

LAST week a dinner was given at the Mansion House in honour of

A GOOD HOUSE TO LET, with Accommodation for Pigs.
THIS advertisement is sure to attract a considerable amount of
attention. There are too many people living like pigs to whom such
an offer of accommodation will be irresistibly tempting. The ad-
vertisement may also be regarded in another light, as an interesting
example of increasing refinement in the use of the English language.
Now-a-days it is evidently thought improper to mention such a
vulgar thing as a pig-stye: in its stead we .are taught to say " accom-
modation for pigs."

MR. PUNCH'S EAILWAY GUIDE.
(Compiled for the Use of Tourists, Excursionists, and others.)
Hints about Ticket Taking.
purchasing your ticket, it will be as well to accustom
yourself to the manners and modes of address of the Booking Clerks.
This task may be easily accomplished by a series of early morning
strolls in the celebrated Fish Market, Billingsgate.
Never address a Clerk when he is relating an anecdote to a col-
league. If you do, you may very possibly spoil the point of his
story, and consequently subject yourself to a not-to-be-unexpected
display of official insolence.
If you have to receive any change, you will find a weighing-
machine (Troy weights) and a bottle of aquafortis very valuable.
Station Suggestions.
If you are fond of walking upon the platform, be careful to wear
india-rubber buffers attached to the toes of your boots. At this
season of the year you will find luggage-trucks rather heavily laden.
If you are fond of ladies' society, ask the Guard to put you into a
smoking-carriage.
If you wish to save your hat from being sat upon, your coat from
being torn, and your legs from being kicked, do not get into a com-
partment occupied by children come home for the holidays.
Necessary Preparations for the Incidents of Travel.
You should choose a seat in a carriage as near as possible to the
engine, to avoid a lingering death.
As an ample amount of luggage is permitted to passengers on
English Railways, you should always tie up your coffin with your
sticks and umbreljas.
Never forget to insure your life. The trifling outlay will probably
be returned a thousand-fold to you, or rather to your heirs, exe-
cutors, and assigns.
Something about Railway Refreshments.
If you propose to lunch on your journey, a small hand-saw will
be found very useful in cutting up fowls and sandwiches.
Never neglect before starting to consult your Doctor as to the best
antidote to Railway Refreshment-Room Sherry.
Buns should be well soaked in water before they are eaten by
travellers with tender teeth.
If you have determined upon drinking a glass of ale, see that you
have time to wait for the next train before you ask that the beverage
in question may be served to you. A speaking-trumpet is some-
times useful in attracting the attention of the persons behind the
counter—sometimes—not always.
Railway Law.
In the eyes of the law railway travelling is not considered as au
attempt to commit suicide. This strange view of the matter has
been adopted by all the Coroners' Juries who have sat upon victims
to railway accidents. A verdict of "Temporary Insanity" has
consequently never yet been recorded in cases of this sort.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

BIDAT, August 6th, be-
gins the last week of
the Session. No more
Essence of Collective
Wisdom till next Feb-
ruary! No more burn-
ing and shining light
from the Clock-tower
beacon above, or the
benches below. _ No
more displays of dizzi-
ness in Office, or drow-
siness in Opposition.
JOHN BULL and the
Times must combine to
exist without thai piece
de resistance, their
"Imperial Parlia-
ment, for five months
to come.
"Finis coronat opus"
says the old saw. But
"Opus coronat finem"
is the rule of British
Parliamentary prac-
tice. What week of the
Session sees such a mar-
vellous amount of work
knocked off as the last?
Look at the Lords, and the Bills
they have made happy despatch of in
these last eight days; the interchange
and consideration of amendments be-
tween the two Houses: the last shots
fired, as the two lines of battle sheered
asunder! the Notices of Motion for
next Session! to say nothing of such
bagatelles as a Review of the Session
from the Hartingtonian stand-point
and the Disraeli tish, the Indian Budget,
and a Ministerial Whitebait Dinner.
To come to particulars. The next
time LOBD OBANMORE (Lords, Friday,
August 6th) wants to know the par-
ticulars of CAHDINAL MANNING'S re-
ception at one of the FBINCE OF
WALES'S Chiswiek Garden-parties,
Punch would recommend him to get
an invitation, and see for himself, rather than
trust to some unauthorised JENKINS.
(Commons.) Unseaworthy Ships Bill (Stop-gap)
read a Third Time, after notice by MB. HEED of
MB. I'I.IMSOLL'S intention to move for a Select
Committee on Marine Insurance next Session.
JOHN BULL may depend upon it, that is where
the shoe pinches; and so long as your ship-
knacker can recover more than the value of his
rotten hulls from the underwriters, he will find
means to sail, and sink them, in spite of all the
Unseaworthy Shipping Bills and Board of Trade Surveyors with which you can dog
his rascally heels.
The report of the Judicature Bill brought up a breeze with it. The Attorneys
are beginning to be a power in the House now, and they showed it to-night in a
not unreasonable onslaught on some questionable points of Barristers' practice, as

the taking retainers in more cases than a man can attend to; the
employing of clerks to screw up their masters' fees, and so forth.
Barristers' fees, like physicians', once came under the description
of "honoraria." the honour of the recipient dispensing with the
need of legal bond between employer and employed. Physicians'
fees are now recoverable at law. No wonder if, under the influence
of such malpractices at the Bar as the above, a feeling is growing
up that the sooner Counsels' fees are made matters of common
contract—where money paid on the one hand means work done on
the other—the better.
With the Second Reading of the Appropriation Bill came the
Review of the Session—both sides of the shield. LOBD HARTINOTON
took the black, in discharge of his duty as Head of Her Majesty's
Opposition. Could he do less, after the stupendous coolness of that
Mansion-House mystification P
"Labour Laws, about the best thing Government had done—but all
the good in them picked out of the pigeon-holes, or brains, of the
late Administration; Public Health Act, mere draughtsman's work;
Artisans' Dwellings Act a big Towns Improvement Bill made
general; Friendly Societies Act, great pry and little wool—without
security against dishonest, local administration, or provision for
trustworthy audit; Unseaworthy Ships Act, a stop-gap, run up in
a scare; the Judicature Act, another stop-gap, forced on Govern-
ment by a mutiny; Agricultural Holdings Act, a law for Landlords
and Tenants to contract themselves out of; wasted time of the
Session, due not to the factiousness of Opposition, bat to the feeble-
ness of Government.
"Summary of the Session:—Public business mismanaged; Par-
liamentary prestige lowered; Legislation emasculated."
DISRAELI, Q.C., contra:
"So much for Opposition's criticism on Government. Opposition
having been a nullity, Government cannot criticise Opposition.; Our
Labour Laws do embody a principle, and we did not find it in our
predecessors' pigeon-holes: it is Abolition' of Imprisonment for
Breach of CivU Contract.
"Our Public Health Act is more than a consolidation. It contains
alterations and amendments of the existing law. If our Artisans'
Dwellings Act merely invites to Town Improvements, why did you
leave «s to give the invitation "t Besides, millions are [waiting to be
invested under it. Our Friendly Societies Bill does all that was
practicable. Our own Merchant Shipping Bill Opposition amend-
ments forced us to give up, willy-nilly; and we were very glad to
get the help of public excitement to save what we have saved out
of the wreck of it. Oar Judicature Bill is, at least, an improvement
upon yours. If the Agricultural Holdings Act does little, you would
fain have had us do less; yon were always advising us to put it off
to another year. If our measures want the element of compulsion,
it is because we prefer that of persuasion. If time has been wasted,
it has been the fault chiefly of a headless Opposition. If the dignity
of the House has been lowered, thank the Members for Stoke and
Lonth for it—not Her Majesty's Government, or me its head. What
case has the Honourable Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition made
out? Has he proved that wn have done nothing, or that it has done
anything?"
Punch, C.J.:
"An unsatisfactory Session. Little to raise the credit of Par-
liament in the matter of Legislation—a great deal to lower it in the
manner. Her Majesty's Government and its Leader, and Her
Majesty's Opposition and its Leader, equally below the mark."
With this duello of the Leaders really ends the Session. Xo
Essence is to be extracted from the dregs and driblets of the last
few days—devoted in both Houses to Third Readings, and considera-
tion of Commons' Amendments by Lords, and Lords' by Commons.
Only on Monday, when the Session was really over, and the House
had dwindled to the faggest of its fag-end, LORD G. HAMILTON
brought in the Indian Budget. MR. FAWCBTT moved a Resolution
censuring the Government for this mockery.
MR. GRANT DUFF, from his own experience, does not think the
House would pay a hit more attention to the Indian Budget if it
were brought in in the prime of the Session.
Much depends on its introducer.
LORD G. HAMILTON had a pretty good account to render, with

the aid, at least, of that very convenient distinction of " ordinary"
and "extraordinary" expenditure. Last year's anticipated deficit
is likely to end in a modest surplus.
MR. SMOLLETT made a savage onslaught on the Public Works
Department, and charged Expenditure on Public Works—his red rag,
much after the taurine manner—with his eyes shut.
Save this belated Budget, there is nothing more to note, beyond
the happy flight of the House on Friday—the pilgrims to the shrine
of Saint Grouse (all but the poor Office-hacks) having sped on their
devotions before the formal fall of the curtain.

At last does us justice. The tuber which nourishes
Patriots par excellence, begs on behalf of
All routs to acknowledge the compliment. Chaff of

When he stated the fact that our climate was humid
In sentences pompous and sesquipedalian,

Doubt not are moved by professional jealousy.

May the " split Opposition, like rain-beaten corn—
As he phrased it—be "desolate, prostrate, forlorn."

May his critics be mute, may his "murphies " be mealy.

FASHION-BLINDNESS.
(A Contribution to the Philosophy of Ugliness. Ey a Social Seer.)
DEAB PUNCH,
THE Saturday Review says that—
"Ladies can never toe ugliness in a dress, BO long aa it is made in the
height of the reigning fashion."
Why, of course they cannot; and I hold that their inability to do
so is a beneficent ordinance of Providence. Free taste and bondage
to In mode are simply incompatible. Fashion has not—never has
had, and probably never will have—anything directly to do with
Beauty. It is here that would-be satirists of the sex shoot beside
the mark. Why does a Woman dress? In order to look beautiful?
Not at all. Not one woman in a hundred cares a snapped hair-pin
for Beauty in itself. Your average she-creature has as little sense
of pure loveliness—in dress, at least—as of pure humour or abstract
honour. To be in the fashion is the great primary object of the
woman who dresses: to attract attention, to eclipse rivals, and to
spend money, are strong but subordinate motives.
The love of change is perhaps at the bottom of the business.
The sphere of mere Beauty is not wide enough to give full play to
this feminine craving, and so Woman makes bold incursions into the
illimitable realms of Ugliness. But—and here comes in the provi-
dential provision I have referred to—she is not conscious of the
difference between the two worlds. Some people are afflicted with a
disease known as colour-blindness. Well, the great majority of
women are what I call "fashion-blind." If they were not so, if
they were at all aware what frights—there is no stronger or more
awful word in the feminine vocabulary—they make of themselves
in their devotion to Fashion, their lives would be a burden to them.
Art and Fashion together are'fast forcing on a sort of apotheosis of
Ugliness. Our picture galleries, our illustrated books, and our
shops and streets, furnish daily multiplying proofs of the truth of
this assertion. The Artists—save the mark 1—deserve unsparing
blame, but the Women are rather to be pitied. They have, for the
most part, no real sense of the beautiful or the becoming as such,
and that is why all satire or argument addressed to them from this
point of view is as futile as paper pellets puffed against a pachy-
derm, or, more aptly, as a mitrailleuse fired at a mollusc. BELINDA
buys an unbecoming bonnet. As a natural consequence, BELINDA.
looks a guy, and, probably, courts a cold. But prove to her that it
is ugly, demonstrate that it is unhealthy, and the dear creature ia
smilingly immoveable as Atlas. You miss the point, I repeat.
BELINDA does not want a becoming or a convenient bonnet, but
simply a fashionable one. A Fashionable Fright is to her an absurd
self-contradiction in terms. When the Fashion changes, she will
freely own that it was monstrous; the spell of Fashion-blindness is
no longer upon her with regard to that particular mode at least, and
Free Taste has a chance, liut Free Taste against Fashion—pooh!
'Tis Lombard Street to a China orange with a vengeance!
Satire has couched many a keen and glittering lance against
the Fool-goddess Fashion, but always, and inevitably, in vain. I
think I have shown why. Saturday Reviewers, and other pseudo-
satirical Mentors, please copy. If Woman care infinitely less for
beauty or health than for the height of the reigning fashion,"
where is the use of proving to her that the height of the reigning
fashion is ugly or iniurious? Against Fashion-blindness, as against
stupidity, e?en the Gods fight in vain. Q. E. D,

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OR, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.
By LEONARDO DELI,A ROBBIA DE TTOOR WESTPOND TUHPKYNS,
ESQ., S.A.S., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the Dulli-
dillitanty Society.
EXPENSE should be no object. My aim is to create a National
taste iu internal and external House Decoration. My hints, there-
fore, will be as applicable to the dwellings of the Poor (to which I
intend to give considerable attention) as to the mansions of the Rich.
Here, for instance, is a plan for a Bed, and a Bedroom, which ca.n
be equally adapted for the poor, the middling, and the very wealthy.
Its great merit is its originality and its cheapness.

THE EARLY ITALIAN STYLE.
Four posts supporting candelabra at the feet and oriental fans
at the head.
Pointed hangings, with bells attached, to be set by machinery to
tunes and time. These could form a perfect carillon.
Between the posts, at the bed-head, is a suspended circular per-
forated pan to hold cold water. A string hangs down, which, at a
pull from the person in bed, will release the water, and immediately
i refreshing douche will be given. This can also be used as a bath
by a person above without disturbing the sleeper below.
The pillow forms a writing-desk.
The mattress is easily opened in the centre by pressing a spring,
and allows the sleeper to descend suddenly into a full-length bath

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
below, which lies between, two chests of clothes-drawers, forming
the side supports of the bedstead. The handles of the drawers can
be taken out and used as corkscrews and pipe-pickers. The boot-
jack fits in naturally at the foot of the bed, so as to be useful when-
ever you happen to go to bed in your boots.
This bed in full operation is admirably adapted to the necessities
of a poor family, where economy of space is an object. Thus: One
person can sleep in the cistern above; the mattress dividing in the
centre (as described above), can open out BO as to make two couches,
allowing air for a fourth person to sleep in the bath below, while a
fifth would find a most comfortable bed in the corkscrew drawer.
N. H.—A clock in a mattress is also most useful; it gives the hour,
its alarum calls you, and it supplies the ticking.
One great moral principle must never be lost sight of, whether by
builder, architect, furnisher, or tenant, and that is,
No matter what your ap-
pearance outside may be,
as long as you are all right
inside.
Can you ever accurately
judge of a man's moral
worth by his looks? No,
no more than you can spe-
culate on the amount he has
at his banker's by the cut
of his hair, the shape of his
coat, or the turn his con-
versation may take.
When a woman is de-
scribed as comfortable, she
is no longer praised for her
beauty. Greek statues are
beautiful, but they never
look comfortable.
A word, therefore, on
Exteriors would not be
inappropriate in this place.
No London house can be
perfect without iron rails in
front. Every London house
might be accurately de-
scribed as within a minute's
walk of a line of rails.
These ornaments are intended to keep up the good old English
maxim that " an Englishman's house is his castle." A castle was
fosse'd all round by its moat. The Feudal Baron gave his order
to the Architect, finishing with, "And don't forget the moat."
To which the Architect replied, " So mote it be;" a phrase which
is still preserved in English Freemasonry.
About an Englishman's Town-house there is no room for this
moat; the nearest approach to it, therefore, is an area guarded by
strong iron railings.
The spikes of these rails should be formed for use as well as
ornament. They should be musical, never flat, but always sharp.
The ironmonger should look sharp in putting them up, and they
should be of sufficient aeuteness to offer a pointed repartee to the
insidious burglar.


They should be sufficiently long to serve as hooks for beer-cans,
pint pots, and hat-pegs.
They should be ornamental and graceful, so as to suggest to
the passing shop-boys, errand-lads, and cabmen the notion of
elegant raillery."
While.on the subject of ironwork a few hints may, nay I am sure
will, be useful. I mentioned burglars just now. When one of this
fraternity is trapped, it will save time, if instead of calling in a
policeman (unless you have a pretty housemaid in your employ, in
which case you may leave all your doors and windows open, and let
the burglars beggar your neighbour—they won't come near you) you
send at once for your laundress, who will at once attend, and for a
comparatively small sum your freshly caught burglar will soon be
heavily ironed.

Modern door-hinges are an utter mistake. Never by any chance
use modern door-hinges.* The only place to obtain really useful
hinges, and in fact all articles of ironmongery, is Mr. J. Selluws's,^
Ifo. 3, Suiter's Rents, Charles Alley, near Gray's Inn Lane.
If a common hinge (I do not mean anv one of those manufactured
by J. BELLOWS, of No. 3, Huxter's iRents, Charles Alley, near
Gray's Inn Lane, W.C.) gets out of order, and there's a screw loose,
so that the hinge hangs down on one side, you will soon find that
this state of affairs will be followed by some other great ex-
ternal hinge-awry to the door. (N.B.—This capital joke was made
by MB. BELLOWS, of the above-mentioned address, who has a ready-
made stock always on hand; and when he has a sore throat he
always has his hand on his ready-made stock.)
A door once in this condition soon comes to utter grief, or as that
eminent disciple of QUENTIN HATSYS, Mn. BELLOWS, Ironworker, of
Huxter's lients, facetiously puts it, "Sich a door is a dying by
hinges."
As by this time the student, for whom I write, must have had a
dose of iron, I will proceed to another and no less interesting
question.
* I say this emphatically, and moat feelingly. Not a single modem-
working ironmonger has sent me an advertisement, or entered into satisfactory
arrangement with me.
t Except thi» most respectable tradesman, and just see how it is in my
power to puff him, (P.S.—My opinions are still open to a change.)
(To be continued.)
THE GONE GROTTO.
Now the holiday time of the year we have got to;
Now the husbandmen hasten to garner their grain;
Now the streets should resound with " Remember the Grotto 1
Bat of that bore we now can no longer complain.
There was one ragged urchin heard something to mutter,
Whilst in fingers unwashed he extended a shell;
But so low was the voice of this child of the gutter,
That his gesture was all that his meaning could tell.
Alas!—though young beggars disturbed meditations,
When they plagued us and pestered like flies or as gnats,
And dogged us and teased us, till wild execrations
We .broke out in against those importunate brats,
0 how glad we should be if once more, at this season,
We were met with the old cry by each passing child,—
Once again, if occasion afforded it reason,
And the grotto again in the alley were piled.
Of two things one used ever the other to follow,
But now of that sequence cessation we mourn;
The return of the oyster and that of the swallow,
To the mouths of the Million too dear to return.
Ah, we well recollect, in Life's race when we started,
Then Best Natives were eightpence a dozen, galore,
But now, save as a dream of an era departed,
We " Remember the Grotto," my tulips, no more.

JUMPING AT CONCLUSIONS.
Ethel (much impressed). "0, Miss GRUMFH, DO LOOK! THAT MUST BE ADAH!"
PERSONS WHO OUGHT NOT TO TRA.VEL.
IDIOTS •who scrawl their names upon the walls, or else carve their
initials on the trees, or rocks, or turf, as a memento of their visit to
places of repute.
Snobs who strut and stare about them in the middle of the streets,
and crack jokes upon the names which are displayed over the shops,
whereof perhaps the owners are sitting underneath.
Persons who not merely quarrel with their bread-and-butter, but
find fault with everything they either eat or drink; and though at
home they often dine on cold or lukewarm mutton and badly-boiled
potatoes, growl and grumble at the choicest cookery abroad.
Men who act upon the principle that "every Englishman is an
island," and hardly condescend to answer civilly when addressed
with common courtesy at a table-d'hvte.
Women who 'persist in carrying their lapdogs, which snarl and
snap at you without the slightest provocation on your part.
Simpletons who scrawl their names in the hotel books, make
nonsensical remarks upon the beauty of the scenery, and express
themselves delighted with the "excellent accomodation" (with
one " m"), or else astonished at the reasonable charges of "mine
host."
Swells who, .journeying en prince, and dressing every day for
dinner, superciliously stare at men who travel with a knapsack and
without a change of coat.
Men who use the tablecloth to clean their knife and fork, between
the courses, and cannot sit through dinner without picking their
teeth.
Persons who persist in airing their bad French, or still worse
German or Italian, in cases where plain English is distinctly under-
stood.
Fools who, when they stray into an unfrequented district, where
the sight of British tourists is phenomenal and rare, spend their
money recklessly, and tempt the simple natives to be extortionate
and grasping to the strangers who come next.
Ladies who hate smoke, and really can't exist without their tea
three times a day.
Men who never raise their hats when entering a Caff, or take the
trouble to conform to common courtesies abroad.
Snobs who, even during service, stare about a Church, and talk in
loud tones of the pictures hung around the walls.
Bores who take their shop-talk with them when they travel, and,
when you would enjoy a pleasant scene or sunset, bother you to
listen to their details of a case.
Ladies, unattached, who cannot stir from home without innumer-
able packages, which exact Inn petiti joins of all the men they meet.
Roughs who, when they go to see a monument or statue, perhaps
of world-wide fame, will, if unperceived, chip off, by way of keep-
sake, a finger or a toe.
Donkeys who, by chance haying discovered a happy valley, with
a trout-stream, pretty sketching, and a comfortable inn, begin to
bray about it in a letter to some newspaper, and bring a crowd of
Cockney tourists to desecrate the place.
Great, and little, Britons who turn their noses up at everything
they see, and make rude remarks on manners which may differ from
their own.
Ladies who persist in wearing shabby dresses when they go
abroad, and of course look doubly dowdy by the side of the smart
costumes, fresh from Paris or Vienna, which they are sure to meet.
Dolts who overpay their guides, and over-fee the waiters and the
railway guards and porters, and in Paris fling a franc by way of
pour boire to a cabman, whom they make henceforth a grumbler
when offered his five sous.
Englishmen who, when they meet a fellow-countryman in France,
think it shows good breeding to speak to him in French.
And, lastly though not leastly, louts who make themselves
abhorred by stumping about cities in their thick boots and old
shooting-coats, ana lounging to the Opera in a costume which is
better ntted for a Music-hall or a New Cut penny gaff.
BOTTOM' SUFFERINGS.
As Law is to Rheumatism, so is Equity to Gout. The fusion of
Law and Equity may be said to form the counterpart of Rheumatic
Gout.

THE IMPORTANCE OP BKAINS.
As regards injuries of the nervous system the present day is,
probably, much like the past.
"The times have been
That when the brains were out the man would die."
Those times do not appear to have ceased to be. Kobody has ever
wen known to survive an entire loss of the brain. But, at one of
the late meetings of the British Medical Association at Edinburgh,
in the course of a discussion of some experiments on the brain of
monkeys, Da. FLETCHBB said he had known a case " in which a boy
had lost two ounces of his brains, and was none the worse of it.
He added that " he had watched the career of that boy afterwards,
but never found there was any difference in him in any respect after
tne occurrence, compared with his condition previously." Where-
upon:—
"DR LOWB asked whether the boy, when he came to manhood, could drink
u much alcoholic liquor as other people?
'DE. FLETCHBB said that could not bo ascertained, as the boy had always
been a teetotaller. (Laughter.)"
The Doctors were evidently tickled by the idea that a teetotaller
lost nothing of any consequence in losing brains. But that does not
Quite follow. A boy who had lost two ounces of brain appeared to
Ua. FIATCHEB to be as wise as he was before. He might have had
wisdom to lose or he might not. The medical philosophers at Edin-
burgh, having had their laugh, could have gone on to ask DK.
mrcHEK a few questions. Dr. Punch would have proposed these
inquiries to DK. I'LETCHER: What did you know about the boy's
nund. previously to his loss of brain? How far did you subsequently
test its powers P Did the injury of the brain extend to both hemi-

loss of one eye is to sight, so is lesion of one hemisphere of the brain
to mind? Or else, then is the brain anything more than mere
padding, as little connected with mind as pudding, and of so much
less noble use than pudding, that there would be something rather

HOW TO ENJOY A HOLIDAY.
A Social Contratt.
I.—THE WKOHG WAY.
PATXB. Here at last! A nice reward for a long and tedious
journey I
Mater. Well, you were always complaining in town.
Pater, Broken chairs, rickety table, and a nideous wall-paper!
Mater. Well, I didn't buy the chairs, make the table, or choose
the wall-paper. Discontent is your strong point.
Pater. And is likely to remain so. lleally, that German band is
unbearable!
Mater. My dear, you have no ear for music. Why, you don't
even care for my songs! You used to say you liked them once.
Pater. So I did—thirty years ago!
Mater. Before our marriage! And I have survived thirty years I
Pater. Eh P What do you mean by that, Madam P
Mater. Anything you please. But oome—dinner's ready.
Pater. Dinner! The usual thing, I suppose—underdone fish and
overdone meat 1
Mater. Well, I see that you are determined to make the best of
everything, my dear!
Pater. I am glad you think so, my darling!
[And so they sit down to dinner.
II.—THE RIGHT WAY.
Pater. Here at last! What a charming spot! A fitting sequel
,o a very pleasant journey 1
Mater. And yet you are very fond of town!
Pater. This room reminds me of my own oozy study. Venerable
chairs, a strange old table, and a quaintly-designed wall-paper.
Mater. Well, I think if I had had to furnish the house, I should
lave chosen the same things myself. But had they been ever so
ugly, I feel sure that you would have liked them. You know, Sir,
;hat content is your strong point.
Pater. I am sure that I shall find no opportunity of getting any
merit (after the fashion of Mark Tapley) for being contented in this
jleasaat spot. What a capital German band!
Mater. I don't believe that you understand anything about music,
Mr. Why, you even pretend that you like my old songs I
Pater. And so I do. Every day I live I like them better and
letter. And yet I heard them for the first time thirty years ago!
Mater. When we were married! And so I have survived thirty
years!
Pater. Eh? Wnat do you mean by that, Madam?
Mater. That I am a living proof that kindness never kills. How
lappy we have been! But, come—dinner's ready.
Pater. Dinner 1 The usual thing, I suppose—a nice piece of fish
and a juicy joint. Now, that's just what I like. So much better
.haii our pretentious London dinners! Not that a London dinner is
not very good in its proper place.
Mater. Well, I see that you are determined to make the best of
everything, my dear.
Pater. I am glad you think so, my darling!
[And so they sit down to dinner.

HISTORICAL ACHIEVEMENT.
THE Surrey Comet confirms SIB JOHN LTTBBOCK'S announcement in the Times,
It fears "that the last chapter in the history of C.I:SAH'S Camp has been
reached." For—
"Navigator* have been employed during the past week levelling the ramparts and
ton, whica may be ascribed either to the great conqueror or to his brave opponent,
CiBsrvELACHUS. The trenches which arc said to have seen the first, slaughter of Saxons
by Saxons, will, if the work of demolition continue, soon ceate to exist."
_ What an exploit will then have been consummated! Its author is covering
himself with glory.
The Conservators of Wimbledon Common are said to have offered to purchase
the site of C^SAB'S Camp at a fair price. It is reported that the proprietor is
a MB. DBAX, M.P. A MB. DBAX is M.P. for Wareham. This will be news to
most people except the hon. Member's constituents. Very few besides, probably,
have ever heard him named. The name of DRAX came before the public for
the first time when it appeared in connection with the Camp of C.ISATI.
Now, unless connected wrongfully, it will remain everlastingly celebrated in
that connection. It will go down to Posterity as that of the Destroyer of
C.F.SAB'S Camp. DRAX, in relation to C^SAB, will live with BBUTUS.
In a nominal list of the House of Commons the Member for Wareham is
marked with a "C."' That means "Conservative."
Yet C.ESAB'S Camp is destroyed, whereas it might have
been spared at a good bargain. This seems to indicate
extremely Destructive principles. Apparently, a mistake
has been made about the politics of the hon. Member.
He has seldom opened his mouth. But his acts speak
for him. If the effacement of C.T.SAR'S Camp be one
of them, Conservatives—and Liberals, too—will cry,
"Confound his politics!"
But the Electors of Wareham—of course Destructives
nearly to a man—will boast of their Representative.
Better late than never'; but now he has done them
credit indeed. That is, in case it is really true that he
has directed or authorised the improvement of im-
proving C.KSAR'S Camp off Wimbledon Common. And
should he, one of these days, ever stand again for Ware-
ham, the Electors lof that evidently thoroughgoing
Radical and Destructive borough will some of them,
with good reason, shout, "Who destroyed C^SAB'S
Camp?" whilst others will rend the air, in reply,
with roars of " DBAX for ever!"
PUNCH TO THE CITY.
MERCHANTS of England, has there come the day
When foulest fraud will make the realm decay,
When, after living a strange sumptuous life,
Each nerve close strung by agonising strife,
'Twill be the fashion of the Merchant Prince
To vanish from the scene, nor ever wince,
Until, poor slave of the Almighty dollar,
The hand of Scotland Yard shall grasp his collar F
The honour of old English trade was knightly;
No man signed bill or note or bond too lightly:
Of many a merchant it could well be told
That, _come what might, his simple name was gold,
And, if disaster came, as come it may
To the most prosperous master of his day,
The trader did not stoop to felon tricks,
Nor rascal dodges with fair business mix,
But took his trouble calmly, well aware
No act of his had ever been unfair.
The modern monster speculators stand
On higher level, and are far more grand:
Surely a Newton mercantile was he
Who made a three months' bill a ship at sea,
Built mighty mansions, delicate pavilions,
15 y help of nonexistent paper millions,
Lived a short, noisy, miserable time,
Then vanished, cowardly, from the scene of crime.
City of London! World-Metropolis 1
The question Punch is driven to ask is this:
Can you not check these felons who have made
Men wholly doubtful about honest trade?
We wonder when some mighty bubble'a burst;
But take this fact—the City knows it first.
A telegraphic tremour passes through
The centre of Finance, and some one knew
If RTTFUS forged, or BALBUS overdrew.
Now, as the tide of gold flows up and down
From all this universe, by London town,
Punch, censor morum, makes severe demand
For sterner discipline in Money land.
Prevention is a better thing than cure:
Fugitive swindlers may some ills endure,
Yet, picking oakum, they will feel quite vain
That dupes have paid them for much dry champagne.
Great firms we have in London: honour, bright
As the keen rapier of the ancient knight:
But there are rogues, on villany intent,
Who 'd sacrifice their souls for cent, per cent.
Cannot the Princes of the City stand
Between the public and this pirate band,
This crew of rogues who have their glorious day,
Defraud whoever trusts them, run away':
It can be done, so Mr. Punch declares;
Golden the wheat, too numerous are the tares:
No longer to the ooinless rogues show pity,
But from dishonest traders purge the City.

THE LORD WARDEN ON MUSIC.
usic hath "charms," we have
all of us heard:
Many a statesman sings
like a bird.
One of the pleasantest
possible things
IB when GBANVILLE listens
while GLADSTONE sings.
Wherefore should not me-
lody's strain
Drive political puzzles out
of the brain?
'Tis trne the House hath a
minstrel wight,
But WHALLEY carols not
every night.
Punch agrees with the gal-
lant Earl
That a singer sweet is the
English girl:
No need for a COSTA to t«ll
us that—
The man who doubts it is
just A flat.
No need for the sculptor
MAROCHETTI
To tell us English girls are
pretty.
In the land where^Venus sprang from the foam,
There's nothing to touch our girls at home.
Through the world of verse a graceful rover,
The Earl could assure the people of Dover
That Music had the Poets' benison,
From CHAUCER and SHAXSPEAHE to BROWNING and
TENNYSON.
"Right you are, my noble Earl,"
Says Punch, of poets the perfect pearl;
And he says to the grouse, "Sing a dirge, wild birdie,
"We've stopped Saint Stephen's hurdy-gurdy."

"THE TWO VOICES."
AT a Meeting held last week, at Dover, to promote the establish-
ment of Free Scholarships at the new National Training School for
Music, EARL GRANVILLK, who presided, in the course of a capital
speech, made the following announcement:—
"The lato Prime Minister, he could say from personal and pleasurable
experience, had one of the finest musical voices he ever heard, and he believed
that MB. GLADSTONE continued to sing to this day. He was happy to add
that his own party spirit was not such as would lead him to deny that MR.
DISRAELI, though he never had the privilege of hearing him sing, was equally
harmonious."
This interesting, and probably by the majority of the people of
England, unexpected information touching the vocal powers of the
past and present Premier, naturally suggests a few questions, to
which we are certain LORD GRANVILLE, with his never-failing
courtesy, will return prompt and explicit replies:—
What sort of a voice does MR. GLADSTONE possess—bass, baritone,
tenor, or alto?
Who was his singing-master? (The value of this information, as
an advertisement, it is needless to point out.)
What are his favourite songst Homeric ballads? Is "The
Pope" to be found in his repertory?
Does he require any pressing to induce him to sing, _and what
voice-lozenges is he in the habit of using? (Another invaluable
advertisement.)
Can he accompany himself?
Nothing seems to have been said about MB. GLADSTONE being an
instrumentalist, or the further pertinent question might have been
asked—Does he not always play "first fiddle "?
Would it be correct to 'describe MR. DISRAELI'S style of singing as
partaking somewhat of a bravura character?
Can his voice ever be said at all to resemble & falsetto ¥
Does he oblige his party with " The Standard-Bearer " or " Awa1,
Whigs, atea' f"?
Do both MR. GLADSTONE and MR. DISRAELI continue to give great
attention to the "Register " f
Would it be possible to induce MR. GLADSTONE and MR. DISRAELI
to take part in a duet together in public—"All's Well," or some
other old established favourite—for a charitable purpose?
Is there any probability that MR. DISRAELI will e ver " sing small"?

ODD FREAK OF FATE.
_ THE following piece of Shipping Intelligence reads like an inven-
tion. But it is a veritable entry on Lloyd't Litt of August 0:—
"FALMOUTK, 7th Aug., 9 p. M.—The Enrica (Ital. barq.), Guagnino,
from Mazngan to this port, for orders, with beans, sunk last night, 20 miles
W. of tho Lizard, immediately after collision with the SAMUEL PLIMSOLL
(ship), from London to Australia. A Falmouth pilot and two of the crew of
the Italian barque were drowned; the remainder of the crew landed here by
No. 6 pilot cutter."
The contrast between SAMUEL PLIMSOLL (ship) and SAMUEL PLIM-
SOLL (M.P.) apparent in the casualty above narrated, seems remark-
ably striking at the present moment. Just while the M.P. is doing
his best to save seamen from drowning, the ship sends a vessel to the
bottom. Whilst the shipowners (of the baser sort) are running down
SAMUEL PLTMSOLL, the SAMUEL PLIMSOLL runs down a ship. So sea-
sonable and unseasonable a coincidence perhaps never was known.
Might not our friend. Old AUBREY, have booked it amongst his
"fatalities" P He probably would have cited it as an instance of
bad luck going with a good name.
Perplexing Passage.
THE Local Correspondent of a morning contemporary concludes
his narrative of the particulars of an inquest by saying that:—
"The deceased's relatives had not heard of his death, as he had omitted to
rrite on purpose to surprise them."
This was no case of presentiment. The deceased had been sud-
denly killed by a simple railway accident. He had tumbled out
under the train. If he had committed suicide by throwing himself
under it on purpose, then indeed the foregoing statement would be
intelligible.
Great Consternation at the West End.
THINK of their exhaustion, their utter prostration! Think of the
restoratives they must have required after such unheard-of exertion I
Imagine the anxiety of their wives and families, when they were so
long past their usual hour of returning home! Picture the amaze-
ment of their domestics when they opened the door to them! One
night last week the Lords sat until five minutes to eleven!
GEMS OT THE NAVY.
IT i« estimated by MR. BRASSEY that unarmoured vessels of the
Amethyst type, which would carry fourteen guns and be of three
hundred and fifty horse-power, would cost £71,000, So much for
Amethysts, even without a setting! These Amethysts are costly
jewels.

NEWS FROM BOSHNIA.

HOBTLT before '.'six
o'clock on the
evening of Thurs-
day last an enor-
mous Aerolite fell
in a turnip-field in
the neighbourhood
of the Capital, not
fifty yards from
a merry pic-nio
party. The report
made by the fall
was so violent that
no fewer than
sixty-eight highly
respectable inhabi-
tants had the drum
of the ear nearest
to the field where
the phenomenon occurred, broken by the
concussion. All the Police who could
be spared from duty, with the Fire
Brigade, were immediately despatched
to the spot; but they proved insuffi-
cient to surround the nissing stone,
which was so deeply" imbedded in the earth that a powerful engine from an adjoining ginger-beer
manufactory had to be employed before it could be dislodged. When the flames had been ex-
tinguished by the Brigade, the aerolite was at once conveyed, gaily decked with ribbons, on a dray
drawn by twenty-four horses, to the Opening Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, where it was received with open arms and boundless enthusiasm. It is sixteen times the
me of the famous meteoric stone which fell from the tail of the great Comet in the Archipelago, in
1796; and presents the appearance of a gigantic fossilised plum-pudding, numerous stalagmites of
igneous feldspar being distributed over the entire surface.
"We have been favoured (writes the deputy Editor of the Soshnian Bedouin) with a private inspection
of a most remarkable vegetable production, in the shape of a gigantic Cucumber, which had attained
the unusual dimensions of six feet four inches in length, and two feet in girth. It has since been
removed, in a covered conveyance, kindly lent for the occasion by a sympathising member of our
Vegetarian Society, to the Town Hall for public exhibition; and we are happy to be in a position to
state that negotiations have been set on foot .with the proprietor of this interesting abnormal growth
of the vegetable creation, which there is every reason to believe are likely to result in satisfactory
arrangements being concluded for pickling and presenting it, enclosed in a handsome glass jar, to the
Museum belonging to the Greengrocers' Company.
At an early hour yesterday morning, a prodigious Mushroom (Munchauseniu*incredibilu) was
gathered in a field adjoining the farmhouse recently in the occupation of the Bailiff of the EIGHT HON.
THE EABL OF GBASSMDALE. Owing to its amazing size, this fungus had just before afforded ample
shelter to an intelligent little fellow, three years and a half old, who, with his attendant, had rambled
oat before breakfast from the cottage where he was staying to recover from the effects of hooping
congh, and been overtaken by a sudden shower of rain. The Mushroom yielded six dozen of excellent
ketchup, and has been admirably photographed by our rising young townsman, MB. MONTGOMEBY
CLICK.
There is now on view in the shop-window of MB. DIAMOND SMITH, plumber and glazier, 184, High
Street, a hailstone which fell in the storm that burst over this town and neighbourhood on the_30th of
last month. The stone is a perfect rhomboid in shape, and measures four inches and a fraction in a
diagonal direction from the apex to the base. It was picked up by a poor boy, not a stone's throw
from the magnificent range of conservatories MESSRS. WOOD AND STONE are now engaged in erecting
for SIB TAVHTOCK ROPSLEY, Bart., M.P. for the Northern Division of the County.
NOTE BY A COCKNEY
NATURALIST.
THE common black beetles (Sca-
ralia-us niger), which so abund-
antly infest the culinary regions
of Cockaigne, are alleged to be
agreeable, although profuse, in
flavour, provided they be deli-
cately larded before crimping,
and then fricasseed or simply
fried. Care should specially be
taken not to injure their antenna'.
which, when crisp with egg and
breadcrumbs, exquisitely tickle
the palate of the gourmet, and
provoke him to the liveliest of
gastronomic feats. There lurks
in vulgar minds a savage pre-
judice against these interesting
insects, by reason, very likely, of
the popular impression that at
times they have been manufac-
tured into Soy. But this may be
assumed to be mere idle supersti-
tion, and SOTKB, the great chef,
wisely set his face against it,
remarking, as he did so, "Hani
Soy qui mal y pense."
Among the warblers which
abound in the vicinity of the
Metropolis, one of the most inte-
resting is the Little Mudlark
(Alauda (rreemrichieniit), whose
plaintive cry may nightly be
heard upon the shore of the river,
where these little creatures con-
gregate in flocks, and pick up
any grub which they may chance
to meet with.
Doubts have been entertained
by sundry Cockney Naturalists
whether the pyramids of oyster-
shells, which in the early part of
August used to be noticed in the
streets, should be regarded as a
proof of the migratory habits of
the mollusc. That the oyster is a
sluggard and objects to leave his
bed seems pretty generally ad-
mitted; but that he is endowed
with the power of locomotion
has, fortunately for science, been
placed beyond a doubt. Whether
oysters shed their shells when
they are crossed in love is a point
on which the Naturalist is still
somewhat in the dark.
Medical Monomania.
MB. PUNCH has lately received several anti-vaccination pamphlets, which he has known what to do
with. These treatises, however, should not have been presented to Mr. Punch. They should have
been sent in to a competition for the Colney Hatch Prize Essay. The Prize to be awarded by the
most dangerous lunatic in the Asylum.

AUGUST DELIGHTS.
AUGUST! unto thee
an ode I must
Build up Pindaric,
calling thee
august:
Which is more

As on the lawn the
soda-water pops,
Into the icy Bad-
minton there
drops
The dusky hornet
or more lively
"wapse."»
As lovely LAURA,
in divine repose,
Brightens with wit
the stream of talk
that flows,
The stinging gnat
makes red her
Grecian nose.
As on the Thames
the happy stream
we woo,
And the accompanying naiads too,
Down pours the electric flood—we 're all wet through.
At some snug Inn there's refuge from the rain—
The watery nymphs we comfort with Champagne:
But how the deuce shall we get home again?
0 August, onoe thou wert a month of nout,
Bringing repose to jaded Commons' House,
Bat now, how desperately shy thy grouse!
Thy epicure delights were manifold—
Thy grouse to London poulterers now are sold;
Thy oysters fetch almost their weight in gold.
And the unhappy and perplexed M.P.,
Who cannot choose his way 'twixt D. and 0.,

And Parliament in wiser guidance revel ?—

TUB divine WILLIAMS makes Oberon, in the Midsummer Nighfs

lately appeared in the Pall Mall Gazette, is clearly not such an
one:—
"Mas. SCOTT SIDDOHS baa distinguished herself at a volunteer riflewoman.
The Btdeford and Torrington Kiilt; Corp* hare just obtained a new long range,
which was formally opened by MRS. BCOTT SIDDONS on Thursday. In the
presence of Sia EDWABH GREBN, the local gentry, and the officers and men
of the respective corps, MRS. Si m><>vs took a Martini- Henry rifle and fired at
the target, making a ' bull's-eye' the first time, and a 'centre' with her
second shot. She was loudly cheered, and the Devon volunteers boast that

EARL RUSSELL'S CURRICULUM.
EABL RUSSELL has kindly supplemented his Further Thoughts on
Education (see Times of August 19) by some still Further Thoughts
in the form of suggestive Examination-Papers. Mr. Punch gives
them the benefit of his prodigious publicity:—
Q. Who is the true inventor of proverbs?
A. They have been erroneously attributed to KINO SOLOMON and
the scarcely Jess illustrious MB. TurPEB, but their true inventor is
EABL RUSSELL.
Q. Who is the heaven-born Admiral of the Channel Fleet?
A. EABL RUSSELL. He is typified in the Union Jack, and also
in the famous Jack who had a sweet little, cherub sitting up aloft to
look after him.
Q. Whom should the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's call in to
complete the work of SIB CHBISTOPHEB WBEN?

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OR, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.

ESQ., S.A.S., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the DuUi-
dillitanty Society.
LIX.IJIETIUS Exterior.—This
style was invented in the
days of the magnificent
BETST TTTDOR, when jew-
elled stomachers, hoops, and
ruffs were in vogue. The
Elizabethan style should be
highly patronised by sport-
ing men, as reminding them
of the Great English Bet,
and of her costume, which
was at that period Raff's
guide. She was in her time
the MADAME ELISE who set
the fashion, and, by my
halidome, gadso, and marry
come up, she would have
taken off a man's head with
the same ease, and enjqy-
meat too, forsooth, with
which she was accustomed
to take the head off a pot of
old ale in the drawing-room
of the Palace. "Tap for
Tap, and so part fair," was
the line which our noble
BETST best appreciated and most applauded, and by "part fair"
she meant the top half of the pewter for me, my dear young
friend. These considerations are absolutely necessary before enter-
ing, however slightly, into an Elizabethan—or as the better edu-
cated classes call it, Elizabethian—Mansion. She was a gay young
woman was BETST TCDOB, and finally an obstinate old woman—

And earned the introduction of Tudor into this distich, whioh was
found scratched with a diamond on one of the panes of the Palace.*
The Tudor or Two-door Style.—This, at first, seems simply to limit
itself to a front and back door, an entrance and an exit. This
notion gives the idea of quiet and repose, and is, in reality, derived
from the word Tudor itself in its original French form—that is the
fourth form in which French was taught wherever EDWABD THE
SIXTH'S Grammar was used—which was "Tu dors, thou sleepest."
In keeping with this derivation, the Elizabethan houses present such
a comfortable snug snoozling appearance, that you feel inclined to
come to anchor in a bay-window, and lie down in sweet slumber for
the rest of your life, soothed to sleep by the gentle monotonous
• "The Panel of the Palace" are, or hare lately been, Old PATHS in the
opening, and HARRY PAYNE as Harlequin in the after part. I never lose an
opportunity, nor do I expect that othen will. "Panes of the Palace "—why,
heavens! what a chance is here offered to the Crystal Palace Company for
next Christmas. The idea is evident: the Palace is glass, therefore the
PAYNBJ—the Pantomime PAYNES—are absolutely indispensable. "No glass
building complete without its PAYNES!" "No expense has been spared,
and all possible PAYNBS taken to render," to. The Secretary of the C. P.

cawing of the rooks, those ancient Christy Minstrels, who never
perform out of the nooks and corners of Old England.
The fainted Style.—This, wherever it occurs, is most objection-
able. A pointed style is most difficult to get over.

Still, this sort of architecture has about it a business-like air,
resembling an acute-angled nose (the appearance of which in our
juvenile ancestors so struck the great and good POPE GHEGOHT),
which, to its praise be it spoken, comet to the point at once, and be
blowed to it.
It is a style of architecture which has been lucky enough to
attract the attention of the artistic Ma. POTHTKB, who may be called
the retriever of mediaeval designs.*
The Early Pointed, or Night-Cap style, was much patronised in
Bedfordshire, but seldom used elsewhere, as, from time immemorial,

ELEVATION OF BzDFOADSHHtK MANSION.
it has always "been considered rude to point," and, therefore, "the
Pointed" soon came to be considered as the architecture of a rude
period. It belongs to a time when the hymn-books, though compa-
ratively unknown, were all noted, and when the music, though of a
monotonous character, was all pointed. But one thing is certain,
that, however great_the objections may be to "the Pointed" style,
it u infinitely superior to the "pointless " buildings of the present
day. The Architect's motto should be, "Build with an object in
view, but don't let the building in view be an object."

THE CARDINAL'S PKOPHECY; or, A VATICAN VISION.
THE Cardinal sat (in his brand-new hat), and he dreamed a
lugubrious dream:
He heard Europe's battle-drums beating for war, he beheld all her
bayonets gleam;
And he says, says he, one may easily see a catastrophe cannot be far;
Seven millions of men, and all armed to the eyes, must portend a
most terrible war!
Heigho! it is sad; yet the world is to bad that it calls for this
bloody self-soourging,
For which, unaware, all the nations prepare, as directed by Heaven's
own urging.
The ill wind of war, which I sniff from afar, shall blow good to the
See of St. Peter,
And, 'stabliah, I hope, the sole sway of the POPE. Could a Nemesis
well be oompleter?
The rascal apostles of Red Revolution have pulled down the temporal
power;
Heaven's justice must seat Humpty-Dumpty again, while j his
enemies grovel and cower.
But chastisement dire and a scourge as of fire are a sine qua non for
redressing
That hideous wrong, and so armaments strong claim a Cardinal's—
sorrowful—blessing!
Threat is not my intent; 'tis a pious lament. I 'm exceedingly
grieved to foresee it,
But the great Diet Ira of "Reds " is at hand, 'tis too late they '11
discover to flee it.
I plainly perceive that the Counsels of Heaven have settled the term
of their tether;
Sear of blood must atone, and the POPS have his own—then we all
may be happy together.
Not in DOLLIHGEB'S fashion,—the mooning schismatic! how dares
he to prate about Unity f
Those blundering babblers at Bonn must be shown that they can't
shunt the POPE with impunity.
The Sirens of Schism sing vainly of peace, though they warble as
sweetly as PATTI can,
The only true pan-pipe to marshal the llouk of the Church is that
played at the Vatican,
On woes men must sup, MESSRS. ARMSTRONG and Knurr are pre-
paring the meal most unwittingly;
Big gun and torpedo shall 'stablish our Credo; so Providence
fashions it fittingly.
Saltpetre shall fume for St. Peter—an incense unpleasant, but yet
an oblation
Supplied unawares by those foes of the Church who are destined to
self-immolation.
Steel, powder, and shot, they will soon make it hot for thy spoilers,
Infallible Vicar!
On that deluge of blood the Sole Ark of the Faithful shall float to
its haven the quicker.
It is sad—that of course!—but if murderous force prove the backer

No doubt it is true that, from this point of view, there's a sort of a

No firebrand am I, though I see in Fate's sky all the omens of woe

TRIPS FOR:TRIPPERS.
(Being afew Seasonable Hints for Vacation Voyageurs.)
^ifl ig the tim
of year to b
caught tripping
At this season
every one wh
can packs up hi
traps, goes fo
his trip, an<
joins the orde
of Trappists am
Trippiuts. Miste:
Indecision stay
at home; Miate
Decision is oi
and away.
A Guide, whi
will give usefu
and valuable in
formation in i
few words, is
just now, mos
welcome. Every-
one wishes to
give himself airs
— sea airs, o:
course — and as
naturally as one would go to a tallow-chandler's for a candle,
so everybody goes to the sea-side for a dip. How many dips go
to a pound is a question which the bathing-machine proprietor
will decide.
Here is a direct line for" the Undecided. Go to DeaL It is really
a Dealightful place, Dealicious, in fact quite the beau i-deal of a
quiet sea-side place. Ton need not stop there long; for the Tourist
has this advantage over the Leopard, that he can change his spotf
just as often as he likes. But Juno go to Deal t Simply thus, and
let yourself down easily: leaving the bottle of London at Victoria,
go by the sea-coast line past Rochester, famous for—well, ROCHES-
TER was famous for his jests and poems, from the sale of which he
made so much money as enabled him to build Rochester Castle, as
every schoolboy" knows,—past Chatham, famous as being called
after the celebrated Premier, who gave his name to that part of the
Theatre where he always used to sit, and which to this day bears
the name of the Pit,—past Faversham, famous for being the place
where the London, Chatham, and Dover Collectors request the
pleasure of seeing your tickets,—past Herne Bay, so called as being
the-favoured spot where Herne the Hunter invariably went for his
holiday, out of the hunting season, and when there was nothing
doing at Windsor Castle,—past Margate, that is unless you stop at
Margate, now celebrated for what the cobblers call the "Awl by
the Sea,"—and then -to Westgate, where no person fond of tran-
quillity would think of staying, as it is said to be " such a rising
place." Of course there are many objections to a "rising place."
At this time of year, the Session being ended, and the House naving
risen, you don't want to hear of anything or anybody rising: it
sounds revolutionary. So take a glance at Westgate (the porters
call it " Westkit," which suggests an easy costume of shirt-sleeves
and no coats), and pass on, via Broadstairs, to Ramsgate.
Here pause. Go down to the Sands early, and take a front seat
;o see the tide come in. You can book this a week in advance. No
fees.
The amusements here are—trying your strength, shooting at the
3hah (for nuts), hearing the niggers, listening to two bands playing
lifferent tunes at the same time, both being a trifle weak in the
ugh notes, but strong in trombones and drums, throwing at the
itioks, taking galvanic shocks from a gentleman with a perambulat-
ng battery, seeing the entire play of Punch and Judy, and having
four likeness taken alfresco with such astonishing results that even
rour best friends wouldn't recognise your portrait. Then yon can
see the London Boat come in, and inspect the passengers, making
ludible remarks on their personal appearance (on every safe occasion,
.e., when the subject is not too Dig), with observations on the
uggage.
Having thus let himself down gently, the visitor may now let
umself down another peg (so as not to deprive himself of all his
wonted excitement at once), and walk over the cliff (which he will
irobably do, if he attempts going to Broadstairs from Ramsgate, as
here are no railings, or posts, or anything to tumble against) to
Pegwell Bay.
Pegwell, or the Well of MABGAMT, corrupted into the Well of
EG, and so into Pegwell. The story of MARGARET'S grim ghost will
be told the tourist by any one whom he may ask for the legend.
Pegwell is the home of the Shrimps. The Pegwellians live on
Shrimps, and by Shrimps; that is, they tell Shrimps, and the
stranger will buy Shrimps.
It was our luck to enter a Shrimp-seller's shop and hear the
following dialogue:
Visitor. Are these Shrimps fresh?
Shrimp-Shopman. Fresh! Bless you, Sir, we can't get 'em fresh
enough!
The Aquarium mania has seized on Pegwell, and two men and a
boy, with five ladders, a wheelbarrow, and two spades, are hard at
work scooping out the sand, and doing whatever they can towards
making an Aquarium. The Shrimps object to the innovation.
Walk on, and pass the Coast-guard Station. Here is the place
for real sport. A splendid cannon is kept here for sportsmen who
come down to pot their own shrimps. A small charge for each shot,
which includes the powder.
The visitor may have a talk to the Coast-guardsman on duty,
without any extra payment.
The visitor will now return to Ramsgate for the evening, where
he can, if inclined for real fun, amuse himself by hiring a small
boat and going out with a supply of fireworks. He will saU, or row,
towards the Goodwin Sands, and there will send up a rocket. This
will be taken as a signal of distress, and will be immediately
answered by another rocket from shore. Then out will come the
life-boat and its crew, with a steam-tug, perhaps a spare man-of-
war or two, and the Harbour and Coast Police Boat, with constables
rowing. Now you can send up more rockets, or Catherine wheels,
or squibs, or anything, in fact, only, be off a* quickly as possible, or
the tun of the proceeding may be spoilt. If they catch you, you
can say you were only lighting a Roman Candle to go to bed by, or
you can deny it altogether, and say, "Please, Sir, it wasn't me;
twas t other boy 1" and point to any buoy that may happen to be
in eight.
Having thns finished a happy day, with real fireworks and real
:un, you can (if unprovided with a lodging for the night by the
Ramsgate authorities) go ashore, find a cradle in the shipbuilding
yard, and go to rest.
Having thus played your hand here, remember that, next day, it
is your turn to DeaL Of which place, anon.
SOBRIETY AT.SOUTHAMPTON.
A ORAND Temperance Demonstration and Festival was an-
lounced to take place on the 23rd instant, in the Southampton
,rieket Ground, and to comprise a meeting under the Presidency of
he REV. BASIL WILBERPORCE. According to a bill of the proposed

up,' meluding'JoHH BARLEYCORN'and a life-size elephant." What

"rue temperance is shown by partaking of JOHN BARLEYCORN in

letters have lately been written to the Times
respecting the "Brent Goose." Certain effusions of
Ritualism, which appear from, time to time in the

EEVTVAL AT BONN.
WHAT have we heard? A Conference talking theological meta-
physics; debating on prepositions, if not diphthongs; the next thing
to Homoousion and Homoipusion over again—an actual revival of
argument on ATHANASIUS'S Creed— "flioque." And all this in hot
August, and within sight .of the twentieth century!
Something like a conclusion, however, has certainly been come to
by DR. DOLLINGEB'S Old Catholics and others at Bonn. There are
Old Catholics and Old Catholics, so calling or deeming themselves.
Some seceded from the POPE five years, others three centuries, and
others eight and more ago,
DB. GUMMING probably considers, if he does not call himself, an
Old Catholic. So, perhaps, does MB. SPUBGEON. Yet neither MB.
SFUBGEON nor DB. CUM MING attended DB. DOLLING mi's Conference.
But CANON LID DON was there. So was DEAN HOWSON.
DB. DOLLINGEB'S Old Catholics have taken that title to distin-
guish themselves from the Roman Catholic body, who swallow the
New Dogma. But now there are1 so many kinds of Catholics, that
really the word "Catholic" has ceased to have any particular
meaning. Might not all Catholics, except Ultramontanes, just as
well call themselves "Protestants "? They are Protestants. Don't
they all protest against the pretensions of the POPE and the decrees
of what the POPE calls a General Council? Yet most of them,
except such Old Catholics as MB. SPURHKON and DR. GUMMING, are
offended if you call them Protestants. Why ashamed of their name?
Your Ultramontane, on the other hand, hates to be called a 1'apist.
But he is a Papist. His exact speciality is that he goes the whole
Pope. Popery is his distinct creed. Papist and Popery have now,
at any rate, become simply definitive, and not opprobrious, ex-
pressions. People and things might as well be called by their right
names—mightn't they?
In the meantime, let the Old Catholics or New Protestants who
have been conferring with other Protestants, or Protestant Catholics,
at Bonn, have all due credit for the agreement at which they have,
in a measure, arrived. They have agreed upon the adoption of
forms of words signifying ideas, if any, which are inconceivable by
the human mind—things which, by any reasonable being, no fellow
can be expected to understand.

Glad will you be of some ioed champagne.

When you 've nothing to do but adore and steer.
Row, darlings, row! Whether Stroke or Bow

Is a question that plagues not me, as I laze,
And on their graceful movement gaze.
'Tis the happiest hour of the sultry year:
The swift oars twinkle; I smoke and steer.
Row, beauties, row! 'Tis uncommon hot:

USING GOOD NAMES.
FAS be-it from Mr. Punch to puff a Music-Hail singer, whether
he be a "Giant Comique" or a "Little Wonder/' or "The
Unequalled" Somebody, or " The Great" Nobody. But Mr. Punch
has just received a programme of the " Great VANCE'S " entertain-
ment, with a picture of the immense comic vocalist himself (and,
by the way, the Great .Creature's hairdresser should insist upon
advertising himself underneath this charming "portrait of a gentle-
man"), and extracts from various papers, stating the almost
unutterable enjoyment they (the writers) have derived from the
Great One's " unexampled," admirable," "artistic," "eminently
successful" impersonations, delineations, &c., &c. So far, "live
and let live" being the motto, and every man his own trumpeter
in the World's Fair, there's no harm done to any one, and much
good may it do the Magnate of Mimics—a new title to which the
Great Artiste is welcome.
But, at the head of all this puffery, there is an announcement
which Mr. Punch reads with regret, and it is this:
"Patron—H.R.H. PBINCE OF WALES, fatroneu—H.K.H. PBWCBBS OP
WALES."
Are the names of their Royal Highnesses used with, or without,
permission? If " with," it is a great pity: if " without," the Great
One should be politely requested to omit them from his pro-
gramme.
There is one delicious puff which, however, should not be
omitted,—
"N.B.—It is a noted fact that the Ariitocracy, Clerjy, and Gentry of the
Three Kingdoms recognite VANCE'S Varieties as the matt refined Comic
Entertainment of the day."
It calls to mind " TABLET'S Waxworks." It is a wonder that the
Clergy do not ask him to perform at the next Festival, and request
him to give "Lord Swoon; or, the Exhausted Swell," " The Shah,"
"The Beautiful Blonde," " Slap Bang!" "Old Brown's Daughter*'
and other choice tastes of his quality, which have doubtless contri-
buted vastly to the amusement of their Royal Highnesses, above
advertised, and still more to that class of young men of the period,
of the cheap swell order, with the rakish air, the unwashed hands,
and the bad cigar, who, we suppose, are included among the
"Gentry" that patronise the Great VANCE. But surely, surely,
our Princess and our Prince are not really giving their countenance
to this sort of thing!

CONSIDERATIONS ON COOKERY SCHOOLS.
LL the arrangements of
Cookery Schools should, of
course, be made, as the
bumpkin said, with a view
to Eton.
In the First Form of a
Cookery School the instruc-
tion should be rudimentary.
The earliest lesson might
be how to toast a piece of
bread, which not everybody
knows. The next, perhaps,
how to boil potatoes. Yea,
"perhaps; because the
ability to boil potatoes pro-
perly is uncommon. It
may even be considered by
some persons as the test of
scholarship in Cookery, and
thought worthy to consti-
tute the principal exercise
of the Sixth Form.
The Second Form might
learn the rudiments of
roasting, boiling, and fry-
ing after having received
sufficient instruction in
Chemistry. One of the
first lessons to be impressed
on the tender mind is that all cookery is essentially a chemical
process, an operation based on principles. An unprincipled cook is
as bad as an unjust steward.
Made-dishes of the simpler kind might be commenced in the
Third Form. For instance, plain hashes, minces, and stews-
including Irish Stew.
The Fourth Form might go as far as bubble-and-squeak and
toad-in-the-hole.
in the Fifth Form the course might comprise the ordinary Three
Courses; not MB. GLADSTONE'S, but those of the well-to-do middle
classes.
The composition of "French kickshaws and toys" should be
reserved for the Sixth Form. At the top of the School the students
could learn to prepare such dishes as potage de tortue clair and turtle
puree, doree a I'ltaliennc, riz de reau, mazarine de foie gras a la
Lucullus, and so on with all manner of salmis, fricandeux, and fri-
cassees—such as supreme de volatile.
These hints have been partly suggested by an interesting report
in the Standard of an official visit by MB. BUCKMASTEH, deputed
from the Committee of Council to inspect the Cookery School of
St. Mary's, Soho, an academy originated by the RBV. ROBEBT
GWTHNB, Vicar, and MB. THOMAB BLACKWELL, Churchwarden, with
the object of teaching " Cookery for the poor and invalids." In this
establishment education does not soar quite so high as mazarine

defoie gras a. la Lucullus. But it is sound as far as it goes. Some
idea of it may be derived from the following extract from a diary :—
"' Went to market at 30 past 9, February 20th, 1875.—Two Ibs. of tripe at
8rf., la. id.; dripping, 4rf.; two sheep's hearts, lOd.; giblets for pie, 6rf.;
onions, 4rf.; pork for soup, 3d.; flour, Id.; currants, Id.; potatoes, 8rf.;
carrots, sage, and leeks, 3d.: total cost, 4s. 9<f.' On this date from these pur-
chases eighteen persons dined."
In this School it will be observed that economy is taught as well
as cookery; and the Vicar and Curates sometimes sit down to dine
in the kitchen on dishes provided from such as the above-named
materials.
In the Soho Cookery School prizes for proficiency are awarded to
successful pupils. In the higher Schools which must soon be gene-
rally instituted, competition will probably be promoted likewise;
but it is to be feared that in Cookery Schools, beyond all others,
there will inevitably be a peculiar tendency to cram.
DIGNITY AND IMPUDENCE.
THE Commissioners appointed to examine into the cases of
corruption alleged to have taken place at the.Bribeborough Election
resumed their inquiry.
MB. CASH examined: He' said he was a member of the firm of
CASH, DISCOUNT & Co., Universal Merchants. He knew nothing
about the bribery said to have taken place at the election. The
fact of the matter was this—the Commissioners would have their
trouble for nothing. (A laugh.)
The Chief Commissioner. Don't he so sure of that! (Renewed
laughter.)
The Witness resumed: What was the good of dragging him into
that room when he had nothing to say?
Commissioner Wagg. Come, Sir, I have no doubt you are very
fond of a drag at Epsom! (Roars of laughter.)
The Witness resumed: He admitted that the Commissioner was
right—on this occasion only! (Laughter.) Well, he had said his
say, and there was an end of it. He could give no further evidence
of any value on any subject to any one. (A laugh.)
The Chief Commissioner. What is your favourite Party?
The Witness. A dinner-party! (Roars of laughter.)
Commissioner Clever. Very likely. But we don't mean that.
What we want to know is this, do you belong to the Pinks or to the
Blues?
The Witness. Well, at the election I belonged to the Pinks, but,
since I entered this room, I have .been in the Blues I (Shouts of
laughter.)
THOMAS CLOBD was next examined. Witness said he was &
labourer. He had a vote at the election.
Commissioner Clever. A what?
The Witness. A vote. Don't you know what a vote is? (Laughter.)
Commissioner Clever. Do you? (Renewed laughter.) Come,
what is a vote? (The Witness hesitated.) Try and describe it.
Well, perhaps I can help you. Is it a vegetable? (Laughter.) Is
it good to eat?
The Witness. No, it's good for drink. (Roars of laughter.)
The Witness resumed: He was a poor man.
The Chief Commissioner. And fond of your beer? (A laugh.)
The Witness. Yes, when it ain't brought-to me by the under-
taker. (Much laughter.)
The Witness resumed: He did not know why he had been
brought before the Commissioners. He could offer no evidence.
At the Election he had had some beer. He took it as a medicine.
(A laugh.) He was not very well.
Commissioner Wagg. In fact it was a case of ailing! (Laughter.)
The Witness. You make a pint of the beer. That's wrong—it
was a quart! (Renewed laughter.)
Commissioner Wagg. I see that you will give me no quarter!
(Roars of laughter.)
The Witness resumed: He did not know why the Commissioners
had come down to Bribeborough. They (the Commissioners) would
make a mess of it. (A laugh.)
The Chief Commissioner. Well, a Bar Mess is a very pleasant
thing indeed! (Much laughter from the other Commissioners.)
The Witness having no further evidence to offer, the inquiry
was adjourned.
A Peculiar Plant.

graph for a—

TRIPS FOR TRIPPERS.
Seasonable Hints for Vacation Voyageurs.
HERE are all sorts of Trips
from Ramsgate for Trip-
pers. By rail, by road,
and by sea. You can be
like " Little Water Wag-
tail," and " sit upon a
rail," or you 'can "put
yourself up for sail," and
go for very ; little,—that
is if you go on board
what is called "apleasure
yacht," at a shilling a
head for two hours, in
which case you 'might be
entered in a catalogue as
among "an odd lot for
the next sail." Some
people enjoy this sort of
thing per se, but, if you'll
enjoy it more per land,
don't you go. Should you,
however, feel that you
are a born Tar, then, avast
heaving and step on board
the Saucy Emma, and
away, with a fair wind,
to Deal, to the home of
Slack Eye'd Susan, to the
scene' of the true lore of that able seaman William, so hardly-
treated by that unable seaman Le Capitaine Crosstree, R.N., both
devoted to La Fille de Madame Hatley. Though, on reconsidera-
tion, it occurs to me that William was Mr. Hatley, and Susan
was no relation to the Hatkys—kvA the subject without a pedigree,
or a chart, or a bill of the play to refer to, is somewhat obscure.
If the sea does not take you, the train will.
En attendant, while making up your mind (the lightest luggage,
by the way, you can take with you), you can look round at
Ramsgate for the Pier, and wonder why, with all its advantages, it
is not to Margate what Dieppe is to Boulogne,—only that for «s, it
should be rather Boulogneian than Dieppish in its opportunities of
amusement. Ramsgate has the advantage over Boulogne in being
what the Guide Books call "a salubrious spot,"—being, in fact,
about the salubriousest spot that ever we did see. No sea-side
place is without some sort of odour at some time or other of the
year, and at some particular rspot. Even Ramsgate may once and
away, with a south-easterly breeze, get a sniff of the mud in its
own harbour at low tide. But Boulogne, with regard to smells of
all descriptions, puts Cologne in the shade, the hitter being unable
to hold a scent-bottle to Boulogne in this respect.
The Tripper to Boulogne will find the smells there so thick, that
he will be positively compelled to cut them—and that as quickly as
possible. In Boulogne the Tripper, who is following his nose, will
be perpetually obliged to stop it in the street.
Every sea-side place has its season and its seasoning, and the
French proverb may be adapted to the French watering-places, and
be read thus: " Chucun a son I'qout." At certain hours of the day
Boulogne is simply Covent Garden by the sea—only worse. In your
hotel, if on the Quai, you are not safe from the incursion of the
odour. - A young lady Trippiste might at Boulogne complain to her
father of the'odour, and say with Hamlet, on Yorick's skull, "and
smells so! Pa."'
Yet our compatriots who would turn up their noses at Ramsgate.
do not object to stand on a foreign shore, and "hold their own," and
even to hold their tongues on the subject afterwards. Indeed, they
seem to be attracted by the smells as bees are by the scents of
flowers. However, our beloved compatriots who, when abroad, can
make themselves so much at home, and who, when at home, are so
often all abroad, have but one use for their noses, and that is, to pay
through them. It is next door to impossible (we forget the number
and name of the street, but the foregoing direction will suffice) to
order rooms in Boulogne, as our countrymen would say, "ong
sweet." Go sweet yourself, and "sweets to the sweet" would be,
of course, superfluous.
By this time, if not by this tide, the Tripper will have determined
how he will go to Deal.
Much of the material for the '' wooden walls of Old England " used
to be supplied by Deal.
Before arriving there, it will be as well to say that should you
find Deal not so warm as you had expected, you can go to a place
that is Walmer.
Temperature is a matter for each individual traveller, as you can
soon make even the Arctic regions too hot to hold you.
Notice the coast. See the Flats of Deal. These flats have not
yet been taken in by anybody; and not having been taken in, they
are, strange to say, not let out; though when lodgings and hotels
are at fancy prices at Ramsgate, it would surely pay any enterprising
Company to let these out, advertising them as Several airy Flats,
with considerable accommodation for large or small families, to be
Let, in the neighbourhood of Deal."
If you go by train, you won't see much of these; but read this,
and ''imagine the rest,'' as the lodger did when he was kept awake
by fl*»s.
The Pedestrian will have 'a good time of it. Naturally it will
occur to him that, if hungry, he can walk into Sandwich.
He will also see, somewhere about here, the commencement of a
splendid building, probably another Aquarium, in these Aquaria-
maniacal days.
Apropos of aquaria, a Frenchman on a visit to a compatriot
residing in London, came suddenly upon the New Winter Garden
and Aquarium in Westminster. He mistook it for a new Railway
Station, and exclaimed, "C'est magnifique! cette Garef" His
friend corrected this wrong impression by his reply, "Out, man
cher, vous avez raison, 'c'est magnifique, mats ce n'est pat la Gare.'"
En voiture, Messieurs, for Deal 1 Carthago est delenda .' which,
being translated, "Carthage was uncommonly like Deal."
Forwards! To Deal, to Dover, and then-
Over the Sea! Orer the Sea!
Let ui away to the Stinkomalee!
Over the Sea I Over the Sea!
To Calais, and so to Boulogne!
Avoiding Folkestone, which is too full to be pleasant. Not that you
will meet with the dregs of the people there, but you cannot help
coming across the Lees.
Au plaisir.
WEBB ACROSS THE WATER.
Co M B, now at last there 's something new we 've seen' beneath the
Sun;
A swim from England's shore to France, which CAP-CAIN W«BB has
done.
So kudos be to CAPTAIN WEBB—and he '11 get it from the QUEEN,
As an ornament to his Country and the Mercantile Marine.
He stripped himself to his calecons—of merino made, or flannel P
He anointed his skin with porpoise-oil, and plunged into the
Channel.
And, whilst bystanders let their tongues in cheers uproarious loose,
Some fools cried, "What a duck of a man 1" and others, "What a
goose!"
Hurrah for daring CAPTAIN WKBB, that resolute Commander!
He has far outdone LORD BYRON, MB. EKENHEAD, and LEANDJER.
As for LBANDER, now his fame must sink to nearly zero;
For what is he compared with WEBB—who's in himself a Hero?
LEANDEB was a Grecian youth, but CAPTAIN WEBB 's a Briton.
Our WEBB is to LEANDER as a large cat to a kitten;
Or rather, since above all things a cat objects to water,
LEANDER is a water-rat to WEBB, who is an otter.
Our Merchant Navy's mostly manned by men of this man's stuff;
A man of might and valour, and endurance firm and tough.
When shipknackers, 0 PLIMSOLL, send seaworthy men like him
Afloat in unseaworthy ships, they need know how to swim!
Now, JONATHAN, let WEBB'S exploit drive none of you too frantic,
So as to lead to more than talk of swimming the Atlantic.
You may cross it in a fragile barque—not to choose an A 1 clipper—
But 0, don't perish in the attempt to excel our doughty Skipper.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION.
IT is strongly to be hoped that, as education spreads, and School-Hoards multiply around
us, a knowledge of something more than the Three R's will be gradually instilled into the
smallest of Great Britons. Little boys now run the risk of being nabbed by the police,
and even pnt in prison, because they have not studied the law of gravitation. In ignorance,
no doubt, of the force which is acquired by the impetus of falling, they drop brickbats
upon trams when passing under bridges, and incur thereby the .peril of being tried for
manslaughter. Unversed in physics, they project mnall pebbles with their catapults or
with their tiny fists; and these projectiles, coming into sudden contact with the window
of a railway-carriage, pierce the glass, and injure, or, at the least, affright, the passengers.
As a preventive to these pastimes, a course of physical instruction might with wisdom be
prescribed; and a fair notion of the forces of contact or collision might be fittingly imparted
to the minds of little students, by exposing a small portion of their bodies to a few blows
with a birch, which should be so wielded as to come into collision with them.

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OB, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.

ESQ., 8.A.S., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the Dulli-
dillitanty Society.
OaoABioiTAL NOTE.—Remember that French polish is most useful.
When you want an old piece of furniture done up to look rather
better than new, you must go smilingly to the upholsterer, and
address him thus, putting on your best French polish, " Voulez-vout
renter?"
Not sufficient attention has been hitherto given to tables.
A table, like a ballet-dancer, should .hare good legs. How much
of them should be shown to the public is a question for the lady of
the house, or, in her absence, for the master, who will act as Lord
Chamberlain.*
Do not lose sight of the fact that there is poetry in furniture;
though this would not warrant you in calling on MR. ALFRED
TENNYSON and asking him, "if, being such a good hand at turning
neat compliments in verse, he would kindly turn yon an eleeant set

,,i legs fo* year dtning-table." The Laureate, his fine eye in frenzy
rolling, would probably be inclined to turn the modest visitor out
among his own laurels in the front garden.
Here at once is a device for a
Shakspearian Table, a figure of
Hamlet intersected in the centre by
the table which Hamleft legs support
underneath. Hamlet's hands are
raised, each holding a little carved
miniature table, while round his
waist is written the quotation,—
"My tables! Meat it is!
Set it down."

This is a highly artistic conception.!
The Addition' Table is so con-
structed that by the simplest possible
mechanism another • place can be
added at a moment's notice. Most
useful (where friends drop in acci-
dentally) to a really hospitable
person. It will be satisfactory to
explain to a host of a -truly liberal
turn of mind that this table cannot
be, and is not intended to be, worked by a Screw. Our illustra-
tion, showing the arrival of an unexpected but welcome .guest, say
the Author of this work,t and the table at once enlarged, to one

place more. We cannot inform the public now it is done. That is
our secret. But when 'tis done, 'tis well and quickly done.
The Multiplication Table is something of the same notion, only
made to suit Hotels and Families arriving.
In'few articles of furniture can so nraoh variety in taste and fancy
be shown, combined with the strictest economy where necessary, a--
in tables.
For a West-End Moneylender1* Dining-room what more suitable
than an Interest Table, with, in the middle, a small fountain, wit li
equally-distributed jets throwing up into the air Scent per Scent't
The Interest Table should be divided into four quarters and sup-
ported by twelve legs. Xhe leg* should be of ebony. We append .
design (our own) for an Interest Table, supported by Twelve BlacK

Legs. The rich ornamentation should be executed in gold, silver,
and as much brass as possible.

Who can* conceive a Conception standing on a table? Such an
object, so situated, appears about as imaginable as a hypothesis on
the mantelshelf or an assumption in the grate. The mind might ;.
well try to form a notion of a chimtcra buzzing in a vacuum, eating
its second intentions.

DISGUISED IN TARTAN.
MoSfiOO HAS BKKN INVITED NOBTH FOB A FEW DAYS' SHOOTING. Ha AKKIVES TOUT A FAIT—" EX MOSTAQSAKD" I
DISCOVERIES IN LONDON.
During the Dull Season.
IF by accident yon happen to remain in Town just now, you will
probably discover—
That, although everybody who is anybody has long ajro left
Town, there seems to be a myriad of nobodies still moving in it.
That London, after all, is a vastly more agreeable city in the
autumn than its fashionable visitors would imagine or believe.
That you may cast away your " Chimney-pot" and wear a com-
fortable "Billycock," and yet be safe from all reproof by your
feminine relations.
That, if you wish to give a dinner at some river-side Hotel, you
can do so without writing down beforehand for a room.
That there are many ancient nooks, and lots of modern sights in
Town which are really well worth seeing, and which, in the hurry-
tourry worry of the Season, you never have the time to dream of,
much less try to go to see.
That even Hansom Cabmen can be civil in September, and will
condescend to drive you nearly two miles for a shilling, even though
forewarned by you that such will be their fare.
That you need not pay for booking your place now at the Theatre,
for you are sure of a good seat by simply paying at the doors.
That the penny papers issue still great placards of their news,
although it puzzles you perhaps to imagine how their columns can
daily be fresh filled.
That now is just the time for trying your new Shooting-boots, and
persuading them, by gentle ambulation in the Park, to adapt their
creases neatly to the contour of your feet.
That you may absent yourself from your seat in Church, without
a tremble lest vonr neighbours should take notice of the fact.
That your Club is all your own now (if the painters be not in it),
and you may read the papers leisurely, and lay your legs up cosily,
and even take your forty winks without a chance of interruption.
That, though your 'Wife perhaps may grumble at being kept in
Town without a sonl to speak to, the novelty of such a solitude is
really not unpleasing to the meditative mind.
VOL. tin. i
That yon never need be dull while yon have your tradesmen near
you, who, for dearth of other customers, will welcome yon most
heartily, and lend you their ears cheerfully whenever yon drop in.
That if you want a joint cut after your own fashion, you will find
your butcher most willing to oblige you, and to throw you in a
sweetbread gratis just to turn the scale.
That you can get a chair now in the Park without a scramble for
it, or may ride along the Row at any pace yon please.
That yon can pass by MESSRS. CHBISTIB'S without running any
risk of being tempted there to bid for something which yon well
know that you can't afford to buy. .
That, if your tailor comes to see yon about that small account,
you may relax your mind by having a few minutes' conversation
with him, and hardly need apologise for taking up his time.
That, should you desire to see the Lions fed, you need not fear the
crowd, nor be nervously afraid that you may have your pocket
picked.
That you may practise small economies by wearing your old
clothes and riding outside omnibuses, without offending MBS.
GRUMDT—who, of course, is out of Town now.
That, when your hair wants cutting, you can get it done directly,
and need not waste your time and temper by waiting to take your
turn while the Artist operates on preceding patients.
That even so-called quiet streets are really quiet in the autumn,
for all the blaring bands and barrel-organs are gone to the Sea-side.
That when the Tax Collector calls—strange though it may seem—
you are not sorry to see him, if merely for the sake of seeing some-
body you know.
If by good luck yon chance to find a friend still left in Town,
what a capital good fellow yon find him to be! and what un-
suspected virtues you discover in his character, especially if he
insists upon your dining twice a week with him, and you have
previously tested the merits of his Cook.
And, in conclusion, that as to all the rest of your acquaintances,
yon will probably learn that you get on very well without them;
though you will also very probably be vastly glad to see them when
they return to Town.

HELPS OF A HIGHER KIND.
SCENE— The Domestic "Board after Dinner. PATERFAMILIAS,
DAT;GHTE:RS, and UHCLE.
Daughters. "What nice weather this would be for the Bea-side,
Papa!
Paterfamilias. H'm! How nice it has been for the harvest, and
the British Association.
First Daughter. And so like it. So dry.
Uncle. Well, this time the Association was, perhaps, a little drier
than usual. But you should read Mus. CHAWSHAY'S paper on "Lady
Helps." That might interest even, you.
Paterfamilias. Will her plan ever answer?
Uncle. Not as it ought to, I aw afraid. Not among the higher
classes.
Paterfamilias. Why?
Uncle. It requires th» Lady of th« House personally to work it
out. She won't, unlwa she his a very exceptional taste for doing
good. Too much trouble. But poor gentlefolks might manage it, if
they ohoce.
Paterfamilias. How?
Uncle. By having Lady Helps, who would be helps in reality,
helping the young ladies of the family do the household woik, all of
it—no common servants being kept at all.
A Daughter. What, help clean knives and forks?
Uncle. Yes, my dear, and boots and shoes; scrub floors, wash
plates and dishes: perform all the offices of maids-uf'-all-wurk,
uooks, kitchen-maids, and scullions.
Daughters. 0, Dnol« I
Uncle. 0! Y«§. 0! I know. Nonpottumw, as the POPE
says. But in poor genteel families Lady Helps could hardly expect
any wages. They would have to accept association, with the family
on equal terms, and board, as sufficient consideration.
Paterfamilias. Common servants ace better oil' in their way than
that.
Uncle. Considerably. But there are people, rich people, who
could well enough afford good wages— if they were only inclined to
put the " Lady Helps" scheme in practice.
Paterfamilias. What sort'(
Uncle. Uneducated people; persons of low origin who have grown
wealthy. Any of them, capable of treating poor ladies with proper
recpect, might derive a double advantage from Lady Helps. In
addition to getting the work of servants faithfully done, boots and
shoes, for instance, thoroughly well cleaned, they might acquire a
degree of polish themselves by habitual intercourse with persons of
higher culture than their own.
Paterfamilias. A benefit for them, indeed.
Uncle. Their children, too, by conversing with Lady Helps, would
unlearn dropping their aitohes—just as, on the contrary, you know,
little boys and girls usually learn from common servants to talk bad
English.
Daughter. 0, Uncle, how can yon!
Paterfamilias. I wish the project could be brought to bear.
Anything to save girls from the necessity of marrying merely to
live.
A Daughter. That must be a sad life for tham.
Uncle. Yes. Still sadder for their husbands.
Paterfamilias. Eh? I say. Mightn't there be Gentleman Helps,
too?
Uncle. Certainly. We know—and I am sure you girls know—
numbers of young gentlemen who are exactly fit to be Helps. They
are sons of small gentry or professional men. They inherit neither
property nor brains. Are perfectly honest, obliging, and civil, but
utterly incapable of learning enough to enable them to pass any
examination. All the higher walks of life are as completely closed
to them as to women; and they loaf about at home with nothing to
do but smoke short pipes, stupefying the moderate intellect they
possess. But nature has admirably adapted them to be valets,
footmen, butlers, buttonses, grooms, and coachmen — especially
grooms and coachmen; for they mostly do know how to ride and
drive. Were Gentleman Helps practicable, then youths might be
rescued from a life of idleness, and, in helping others, also in some
measure get to help themselves.
Paterfamilias. Eh, now, after that discourse, practise your
preaching. Help yourself, and pass the wine. And let us drink—
"The Dignity of Domestic Sendee." Paterfamilias, at any rate,
can appreciate the endeavour to promote it which has been made at

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OR, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.

ESQ., S.A.S., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the Dulli-
dilUtanty Society.
Astronomical Tables.— Our designs for these will, ws feel sure, be
praised up to the skies. They can be specially ordered, and will be
adapted, according to the order received, to the use of stars of the
first magnitude.
We impartially
advise MESDAMES
NILSSOIT, PATTI,
TITJKSS, and the
other operatic
stars, to inspect
our Catalogue.
The one idea
of increasing a
table has hitherto
been to split it
up into leaves.
These leaves, be-
ing invariably
brown, or some
dull colour, give
the table an au-
tumnal appear-
ance, far from
exhilarating. Our
design for a Sunflower Table, without leaves, meets every possible
contingency, and overcomes all difficulties.
K.B.—To carry out our magnificent designs, we have already
rented a large space in a well-known table-land. The address, for
various reasons, cannot be published at present.
The Tea Table ought in every way to carry out its name. Nothing
for simplicity can compare with the accompanying illustration:—


In houses where green and black teas are mixed, in obedience to
the rule " always cross your teas," it will be as well to have another
sort of table in use. But, really, if you trust to us, you can't have
too many of these tables
[designed at our place, pa-
tentea'd and sold only by us.]
This symbolises the mix-
ture abovementioned, and is
called the Cross'd Tea Table.
There can be no possible
doubt that much space is
wasted in our rooms, while
much space is inconveniently
occupied. Thus, what are
legs of tables, as a rule, but
difficulties in the way of our
own legs? "I beg your par-
don, is that your leg or the
leg of the table?" is a com-
mon question. The situation
is most awkward. But if
there were no legs—if all
tables were what we shall
henceforth term (having pa- CRO ss*& T "IABLE.
tented the name) "Biffin
Tables," the difficulty would be cut away from under our feet.
It is evident that guests round a table are not likely to knock
their heads together: heads have eyes: legs have not.

The space above the table is free and unoccupied. I do not say, let us put
our legs on the table; no, but let us, in the interests of Decorative Art, and in
the name of all that is commonly sensible in furnishing, utilise this vacant.
space, and let us either support the table by four strong wires from the centre
of the ceiling attached to the centre of the table, or by the same number of
wires fixed to the four corners.
The wires can be golden-coloured or silver; or they may be as chains of
flowers supporting the banqueting table. Or, if another plan be adopted, a
handsomely carved brass rod, of bed-post circumference, could descend from the

ceiling to the centre, representing the trunk of a tree, while the branches 'would
serve for light, and the effect would be what is expressed in the additional
title, the " Picnicky Biffin Table."

THE GUIDE OF THE CYNICAL TOURIST.
Compiled by SIR CHARLES COLDSTBEAM, Second Baronet.
Aberystwith.—Chief occupation of visitors—pebble collecting. Here they
speak Welsh, and dine at one o'clock. Principal attraction — the Atlantic
Ocean, which, at this point of its career, is strongly suggestive of the River
Thames off Gravescnd.
Boulogne.—Rather more English than Ramsgate. Bathing on the sands,
with the occasional nse of a Tidal Wave. Bone-breaking and other attractions
on the Skating-rink. Port odoriffrant three P.M.
Cologne.—Sights limited—drains unlimited. To prevent any unpleasant-
ness, it is as well to remind travellers that, strange to say, killing a Cathedral
Commissionnaire is considered murder, and not justifiable homicide.
Dieppe.—French watering-place of the usual character. Sun-dresses and
chatter. The Casino will be found an excellent cage for jackdaws and parrots.
JExeter.— Should only be seen from the window of a railway-carriage.
Enemies may be recommended to visit this City, with the certainty of vengeance.
Folkestone.—Dear and dull. During the calm weather, even the Boulogne
Boat loses its attraction, except when Frenchmen are on board.
Geneva.—Brussels is a bad imitation of Paris, and Geneva is a worse imita-
tion of Brussels. Mont Blanc is sometimes on view—when on view, Mont
Blanc is uninteresting.
Hastings.—Pronounced by many of its visitors 'Astings.
I/tterlachen.—Decidedly slow. Cockney accessories prominent and un-
pleasant. JungFrau in the sunset—rather "loudly"dressed. Scenery—over-
done.
Jersey.—Better than Guernsey, but not to be compared with Southend.
Knightsbridge.—Near the Park and the Barracks. Capital place at this
season of the year. No one there!
Lucerne.—Table d'hote at the Sohwerzerhof Fair. This meal consumes
about one hundred and twenty minutes—the remaining two-and-twenty hours
of the day will be found excessively depressing.
Margate.—Several cheap excursions daily from London!
Naples.—After you have seen the Bay, take the advice of the natives, and
die. Von will have nothing else to do.
Oucht/.—Music and mist. The Lake monotonous. Company genteel, and
the Sunday Scotch.
Paris.—At this time of the year an excellent place for old melodramas, dear
hotels, and sun-strokes. French spoken on the Boulevards, near the Palais
Royal, and in the Rue de Rivoli, as at the best finishing schools of Clapham
and Putney. Costumes of the visitors quaint and unpicturesque.
Quebec.—Comparatively new. When the electric telegraph is brought to
perfection, you may spend an afternoon in travelling to Canada and back with
H line amusement. At present the trip is rather impracticable, unless you are
passionately fond of ballooning.
Ryde.—Would possibly be a very pleasant place indeed were it not for the
yachts, the sea, and "the Island."
Scarborough.—The Margate of the North. Much patronised by Birming-
ham, Sheffield, and Lower Tooting.
Tunbridye Wells.—Good place for Cemeteries. The
decease of Her late lamented Majesty QUEEN ANNI:
accepted here as news.
Lxbridge.—Capital spot to drive a coach to—and back
again.
Venice.—Damp.
Waterloo.—Place to be carefully avoided by patriotic
Britons staying at Brussels.
X.—A sign signifying the unknown. A splendid
place, if you could only find it.
Yarmouth.—Cheerful town for people who live
entirely upon bloaters.
Zurich.—Go to Xurich, and be happy. Don't go to
Zurich, and be happier still.
N.B.—Mr. Punch wishes it to be clearly understood
that he has no sort of sympathy with the rather extreme
views of his " used up" contributor.

there is—

aged Woman, R.C., a« GENERAL SERVANT, to wwh

Most people will flatter themselves that they have

but not oftener than once a day f

knife-cleaning, proportion of the water-rate, loan of latch-key, &o.?
Shall we get our meat at HOUND'S, who displays the PRINCE OF
WALES'S Feather* over his shop-door, and plumes himself on being
"purveyor" to His Royal Highness; or at CLEAVER'S, who boasts

Shall we be praise worthily economical, and determine not to spend
a single unnecessary sixpence; or shall we, as we have oome to
Pierpoint, enjoy ourselves to the utmost, go in for all the amuse-
ments of the place—pier, public gardens, theatre, concerts, Oeean-
arium, bathing, boating, fishing, driving, riding, and rinking—
make excursions, be ostentatiously liberal to the Town Band, and
buy everything that is offered to us on the Beach P

WHAT is the object of the subscription for CAPTALM WEBB P Only
to reward merit. It surely cannot be to keep his head above water.
He has shown us that he is able to do this for himself. However,

the hour that " There it a tide in the affairs of man, which, taken
at its flood, leads on to fortune,"—via Dover and Calais.

PIETY AND POLICY;
OR, PASSING WORDS WITH A PILGRIM.
E 'D a very keen eye
and a fair
double chin,
And the set of hia
lips was more
sly than de-
mure.
"Whither bound?"
we inquired.
With an affable
grin,
He replied, "On
a Pilgrimage,
friend, to oe
sure!
Out of date? Not
at all! 'Tis a
day of revivals;
Time's clock is
turned back-
wards, the POPE
holds the key.
The Palmers of old
have their lat-
ter-day rivals.
Well fugled by
PUTS, GHAF
STOLBBBG, and
Me.'
"Who am I ? Well
—ahem!—I'm
incog, for the
nonce;
But I'm very well
known, though
I 'm not to DO
named.
I used to wield sceptre and crosier once,
And—well, well, we shall see! Pious zeal is inflamed
For the Paray-le-Monial Nun. We 're supplied
With badge and with banner, with legend and motto.
In honour of her—it must fill her with pride!—
We are off on a pilgrimage now to her grotto.
'Cvi bono? Good friend, time would fail me to mention
The gains to be looked for, there's such a variety;
'Twill keep us en evidence, stir up contention,
And give a freeh fillip to Catholic piety.
Sauves Some et la France.' A good cry, and we hope
It may help to put BISJCABCK—the brute!—in a panic.
He's had rather the pull in some rounds with the POPE,
But we '11 play off the Gallic against the Germanic,
'And checkmate him yet. We 've the POPE'S special blessiagr;
The fair Teuton fraiileins have broidered our banner;
So I think, on the whole, we 're—for tyros—progressing
In a pleasant and highly professional manner.
Xii need for sore penance, or peas in our shoes;
Such stuff is, of course, obsolete and absurd;
No civilised comforts we 're called to refuse,
While en route for the shrine at Oar Lady of Lonrdes'.
'Notre Dame des Vicioires !—a nice rendezvous surely
For patriot Teutons who never could plot to
Set Faith, against Fatherland! Piety purely
Inspires them. 0 yes! Thy miraculous grotto,
MARIE AUCOCHTE, is a godsend indeed
For a Pontiff sore put to it. Hope sweetly sings
That the new Holy Pantomime's bound to succeed
Since the Pilgrims are puppets, the POPE pulls the btrings.
'Vine the Virgin of Lourdes, and hurrah for the road!—
Of the Pilgrims, I mean—we are dropping the leaven.
Processional piety, quite a la mode,
Must further the views of the Vioar of Heaven.
Farewell! I 'fall ia'!" He adjusted his cloak
And his face, till be looked like a Saint orthodox:
None had dreamed that a sinister smile ever broke
O'er the lips of this latter-day Reynard the Fox!
Horpnro rrc RENT—UITBIVALLBD FEAT.—The other day, a Kentish
labourer took one hop from Faveraham to Canterbury. He is none
the worse, and backs himself to repeat it on the first opportunity.
TRIPS FOR TRIPPERS.
(Seasonable Hint* for Vacation Vbyageurs.)
AT Deal. Deal is not only unfinished, it is hardly commenced.
It is a charming place for a Tripper, but for anybody who aspires to
be more than a Tripper,—well, this carefully-compiled Guide is not
"for the likes of him." A Tripper should never be caught tripping,
—and this he might be if he once ceased the rotary or merry-go-
round-the-world movement, and became, what the celebrated bad
oyster was, and what a "welcher" never is, a settler.
There is a new terrace at Deal—but it <» new; and the road is
new; and, as the song used to say, "Wait a little longer."
But, per contra, there is a first-rate pier, with a tramway (price
one penny) right up to the end of it; and at the end of it there are
baths, as good as you '11 find anywhere; and the Deal Band can
come out there strong on occasions,'pretending to be Brighton—at a
distance. Though, as to saying a word in favour of Brighton, now-
a-days, be that far from this Guide, which seeks to introduce the
Tripper to cheerful, but comparatively quiet, places, where London-
over-again is less an object than a pleasant lounge on a beach, a
walk on the sands, and sufficient amusement within reach, if you
feel inclined for it.
Sailing, bathing (not very great), lounging on beach under
shadow of an awning (an excellent idea of a spirited proprietor—on
spec), rowing, piering, sailing, and plenty of fishing,—these are the
recreations of Deal.
The Tripper will go over to Walmer Castle, and visit Richborough,
which belies its name, being, apparently, a Poor-borough. How-
ever, the Guide-book purchased on the spot will tell you all this,
and time is getting on, the Long Vacation will be over, and the
undecided man will not have left London, unless this Guide becomes
his familiar friend, and tells him where to go.
From Deal to Dover by Coach.—Yoioks! tantivy 1 tallyho! and
any other sporting ejaculation inspired by the sound and sight of
the word '"Coach"—that ia, as a means of conveyance, not as it
sounds to Undergraduates' ears, who would only connect coach with
cram. And, by the way, on most occasions, the Coach from Deal to
Dover is connected, very closely .connected, with cram. It is usually
crammed inside and crammed outside, and the weakest are left
behind in the struggle for places—for "booking" is a mere form
with the proprietor of the Deal and Dover Coach. How the luggage
is managed, the Proprietor and Providence (who most assuredly
watches over him) only know. How ten people manage, on an
emergency, to squeeze into space which is a tight fit for six, Provi-
dence may know, the Proprietor doesn't. But here it is advertised,
in large letters over the office-door, with two "o's" in Dover, either
because that is the way to spell it, or because the Fruiter was out of
the letter £. So the Tripper will read, staring him in the face—
"THE DOVOR COACH,"
and will ascertain, on inquiry, that it starts from that office.
Ah, my Trippers! Imagine a neatly appointed turn-out, buff and
blue, or dark maroon, drawn by four greys, richly caparisoned, with
chinking bits and burnished buckles, tight reins, roses in their ears,
knowing leaders, strong, hard-working, but sprightly wheelers-
imagine the Coachman in his long white coat, with pockets in every
possible place, and a flap over his shoulder to protect him from rain,
airily flicking a fly off the leader's ear with his long whip, and
tooling the "tits with a dexterous turn of the wrist and the
slightest movement of the left foot on the foot-board, as they whisk
round a right-angled corner—imagine the Guard, in scarlet and
gold, perched up behind, guarding the bags, beguiling the
passengers with his stories of the road, and occasionally awaking the
echoes with his post-horn—imagine all this, and anything sporting
the Tripper likes to add to the picture;—for, when he sees the reality,
the ideal will vanish, "leaving not a wrack behind," except the
"Dover Coach" as it really is, viz., a second-rate ordinary omnibus,
with a knife-board outside, and a couple of steady useful animals to
draw it from Deal to Dover.
Monte:, Messieurs les Trippers, montez! En route .'
A Palace for the Parisians.
THB deliberations of the Committee appointed by the Versailles
Parliament to consider what should be done with the remains of the
Tuileries, have resulted in a report, drawn up by M. MONNET,
recommending a faithful restoration of the external features of the
building, but mentioning the circumstance that—
"M. GLAIS lirzoiv proposes that it should be the restibule of an immense
glass building, exceeding the Crystal Palace in splendour and utility,"
It is obvious to the meanest capacity that this idea of M. GLAIS
BIZOIN is worthy of a master—glazier.

ROMANCE OF THE KITCHEN.
Cook (/; om flu, Area).
'0, 'LlZA, Ol' MTt MY 'WlNIQRETTE—I 'VE ?AD A—OFJBK—
FROM THB
"WHERE SHALL WE GO?"
AMANDUS exclaims to AMANDA,
When Roses are richest in bloom,
And Clematis climbs the verandah,
And full is the air of perfume,
"To go out of Town in September
Is an absolute duty, 1 know:
I 've done it since first I remember—
But, where shall we go?
"I don't care for Alps in hot weather;
Hill-climbing don't suit men of nuus;
Very pleasant a tramp through the heather,
Bat scarce, as I hear, are the grouse:
Iceland sounds nice and cool, but they say it
Is turning to lava and snow,
Sinoe volcanos and earthquakes betray it:
So, where shall we go?
"There's your Uncle, whose partridge and pheasant
Uncommon good shooting afford;
But he potters away on the peasant,
Until one is awfully bored.
When, a fellow gets so philanthropic,
They should send him to Hauwell, you know.
I can't stand the horrible topic—
So, where shall we go?
"There's Trouville and Deanville patrician,
Where fashions in bathing are fine,
And the nymph is a very nude vision,
And it costs you a guinea to dine:
There's Brighton for fun and flirtation,
The Thames, for a jolly good row:
But I say, with, a strange hesitation,
0 where shall we go?"
Then AMANDA she said to AMANDUS:
"There must be some corner divine,
Where the countryfolk can't understand us,
And won't charge us double for wine;
Where, escaping from civilised fetters,
We oan hear the cool rivulet flow,
And never be bothered with letters—
Aye, there let us go."
LONDON IN SEPTEMBER.
MY DEAK MB. PrarcH, September 4,1875.
I AM quite sure that you sympathised with me, when I was
forced, bv circumstances over whicn I had no control, to refuse your
very kind invitation to accompany you and two other " guns" over
the stubble on the ever-glorious First. If a proof were'needed that
your sympathy was sincere, a certain hamper, labelled " Game,"
received at my solitary lodgings yesterday, afforded the proof
required. Your happiness was indeed a contrast to my misery. In
my mind's eye on Wednesday I saw you the whole day. First you
were blazing away behind the dogs; then, under the cover of a
leafy hedge, you were exploring tne succulent treasures of tne
luncheon-basket; then (a few hours later), you were driving merrily
home in the dog-cart, so that you might reach the hall in ample
time to drees for dinner. Yet, we both 'of us know that a certain
amiable and accomplished hostess likes to see her husband and his
guests assembled in the drawing-room before the sounding of the
second gong. A pleasant dinner, some claret, a little mu&io, and a
pipe in the smoking-room after the ladies had retired. That was
your programme, was it not?
And what was I doing on the First? Alas! I was all alone in
London the deserted, London the dull! As everybody knows, there
is not a soul in Town in September. This year is not an exception
to the general rule. As a proof that my assertion is what the
French would call "exact," I send you the diary of my day's work.
After breakfast I walked down Regent Street, and could scarcely
make my way along the pavement for the crowds of red-cheeked
people who blocked the way. Staring into every shop were fathers,
mothers, sisters, and brothers.
Driven from Regent Street, I lounged into the Park, and for my
pains was deafened with the hearty shouts of a thousand vigorous
children. Not satisfied with this cruel outrage, they knocked off
my hat with india-rubber balls, and broke my thins with hoops of
wood and iron.
Hurried thus from the streets and the gardens, I determined to
visit some of the "morning entertainments" which during the
Season are so very popular. I looked in upon three, and quick! y
locked out again, for I found the rooms crammed to suffocation.
"There is evidently nobody in the West End of th« Town," I
murmured; "then let me try the East."
I walked into the City. I was pushed right and left, and took
ten minutes to cross from the Royal Exchange to the Mansion House.
"The East is every bit as empty as the West," I oried, bitterly,
and turned my face homewards.
Tired out and weary, I went to my second Club (my first is closed
for repairs), and had to wait half an hour for a table. At last I
managed to dine, but the meal was not served comfortably. The
waiters seemed overworked, and the Members were numerous.
However dinner is a great restorative, and I was soon, merry and
sociable. I met a Club friend.
"You here!" he cried, in'surprise.
"You here!" was my very satisfactory answer.
We discussed the dreariness of. Town, and after a small oup of
coffee, a smaller glass of cura<;oa, and a mild cigar, decided that the
only thing to be done was to go to the play. We sent out for Stalls,
and would you believe it, my dear Mr. Punch, not a single place
could be obtained for love or money 1
From this letter you will at once gather that London, (as is usually
the case in September) is unquestionably empty.
Yours very mournfully,
THE LAST MAS LEFT nr TOWN.
.
The Model Man-of-War.
ABOVE half-a-million of public capital invested in the Vanguard
has been added to the Treasures of the Deep. But the money sunk
at the bottom of St. George's Channel is not all thrown away. Now
we know what to look out for in case of a war. And, seeing that
the Iron Duke poked her ram through the mail of the Vanguard,
we now clearly discern that all our Ironclada of the future must be
of the Punch type.

A TEMPERANCE LINER.
i
A CERTAIN Marine Engineer had his certificate suspended the
other day for twelve months, by the Hull Local Marine Board, for
drunkenness. He had signed Articles to go from Hull to New
York in the Wilson liner Naearino, as Chief Engineer. He got
down in a cab to the dock just as the steamer was going out of it.
Witnesses declared him to have been so drunk as to be incapable of
getting on board. Happily, perhaps, for others as well as himself,
he was left behind. But we are not sure. For, according to the
proverb, there is a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft to keep
watch for the life of drunk JACK—amongst other drunkards.
And the crew of the Navarino appear to have been, in respect of
sobriety, the mates of their Chief Engineer. The Times, in a para-
graph headed "Unseaworthy Sailors," and containing the above
particulars, further states that :—
"The vessel left the dock at Hull on Saturday the 29th ult., the bulk of
her crew being intoxicated at the time appointed for sailing. One of the
gallon fell overboard, owing to hia drunken condition, as the vessel passed
through the dock lock. Later, whilst she was at anchor in the roads, another
of the men jumped overboard, while intoxicated, and was drowned."
It will of course occur to almost every reader that although the
Navarino had gone no further than the roads, her crew were already
half-seas over. We can only hope that the vessel herself ever got
so far as the middle of the Atlantic, and did not, very soon after she
left Hull, go down to the bottom of the German Ocean.
Cause and Effect.
"LouiSE LATEAD, according to a letter from Brussels, is again a stig-
matist. For some weeks, her sister having kept priests and sightseers aloof,
she reverted to normal habits and conditions; but relapsing into a state
which led to priestly services being called in, the former symptoms, fasting,
trances, and stigmata, have reappeared."
THIS case of miracle (so-called) abroad,
We stigmatise it as a case of fraud.
SCOTTICISM AND WUTTICISM.
A PtTBLic-spiBiTBD act of an ornament to the Scottish Peerage has
received a due acknowledgment from grateful citizens. Witness
the annexed paragraph in the Times respecting—
"THE EARL OF AIBLIE. — At a meeting of the Dundee Town Council
yesterday, it was unanimously resolved to confer the freedom of tho burgh on
the EAB.L OF AIRLIE, in recognition of his generous assistance to procure a
new water-supply for the town."
This resolution having been voted by the Dundee Municipality,
there is too much reason to fear that more than one Member of that
corporate but national body took occasion facetiously to remark that
"it's aye the Airlie bird that picks up the worm,"

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OR, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.
By LEONABDO BELLA 11 MI HI A DB IUDOE WBSTPOND TTMPKTHS,
ESQ., 8.A.8., A.B.F., M.D.F., and Hun. Member of the D*lli-
dillitanty Society.
IT may be objected that my designs are impossible except for
millionnaires. Quite the contrary. I am prepared to furnish any-
hudy and everybody with a hundred varied designs equally adapted
tn the peer or the pauper, the private house or the public-house,
the palace or the pavilion, the homestead, the hut, or the hovel.
U.S.—The present writer has turned his attention largely to
Hovels. Hovels furnished entire on the most reasonable terms, and
tuken to any part of the kingdom.

N.B.—All builders of Castles in the Air I am able to furnish with
ideas—at a moderate charge. As the patient says, who is going
through the system of Earrogate or Aix waters, "A considerable
reduction made on taking a quantity."

The Hall.—The Hall, where you leave your hats, should be paved
with tiles. This is what is termed "corresponding affinity" in
decorative art.
A School-Room.—A School-room
should be furnished exclusively
with cane chairs. A boy inclined
to be obstreperous will be re-
minded of the fate in store for him
•when told to seat himself in one of
these chairs.
The Drawing-room should be as
attractive as the magnet; for a
drawing-room is a room which,
like a successful piece, draws.
There should be in it several cabi-
nets or chiffoniers (called in Lodg-
ing-house English " sheffyneers "),
because these are full of drawers.
These are general notes which
may be of some use to my readers.
It is a (treat pity that the prin-
ciple of Pantomime tricks has not
been introduced into furniture.
Why should we avoid the Panto-
mimic in one art when we have adopted it in another? Why

reject in furnishing what we jump into in clothing? At one time
no well-dressed gentleman was without a pair of pantaloons, and

the French tailor still has the "pantalon" on his list. Again, in the
garden, the most jealous and the strictest of housewives would not
object to seeing her husband utilising his leisure hours by training

Columbines. While, in some instances, when the landlord took an
interest in the cottage of his ploughboys and other yokels, he might,
like a fine Old English Gentleman, make them a present of half a
dozen Columbines apiece, and let the clowns themselves train them
up in the way they should go.

This is no digression, hut merely a note or two on the road to the
application of the Pantomimic Principle on furnishing.
(To it continued.)
A Nominal Euphemism.
Ai Bow Street, the other day, a prisoner was committed for trial
on a charge of theft. He was named JOHN SHOJESMITII,. but had at
one time gone under the name of DUVAL, and many different names.
Of all the aliate$ MB. 8HOE8UITH could have selected, the most
appropriate one would surely have been COHULEK.

Rationalism and the Reverse.
PROTESTANTISM, CARDINAL MANNING has told us at
Manchester, ends in Rationalism. But has not Roman
Catholicism, a good deal of it, in the land of VOLTAIRE,
and other "Latin Races" than the French, made the
same end? Still, to some extent, no doubt, it has ended
in the reverse of rationality. Few reasonable persons
will deny that the doctrine of Papal Infallibility and
the legend of MARIE ALACOCQUE, are entirely contrary to
reason. However, people who profess belief in absurdi-
ties are not always so unwise as they seem. If CARDINAL
MANNING will only try to analyse his own thoughts,
perhaps he will discover that a man can at most only
believe that he believes in propositions which express not
any ideas that are conceivable, and in dogmas which he
has swallowed whole without first having chewed them.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(One Evening in Town en route.)
SIR,—No one, at this out-of-town Season of the year, would
dream of representing You in London, except en passant. Having
to leave the grouse in the North in order to join my yacht in the
South (this is, of course, what I say to anyone I meet in Town) it
occurred to me that London would be an excellent via media.
"To think, with me, is to do," as JULIUS C.KSAK said, on the
celebrated occasion when but as this ought to be known to every
schoolboy, I will not pause for the historical details.
"Take me," said I to the Cabman, whose emotion on seeing me
arrive was most touching to witness, "take me to mine Inn, the
1 Bedford,' Covent Garden, where 1 take mine ease. Away!'
The Cabman touched his hat. It was a sign that I had touched
his heart.
By the way, is there no voice that can make itself heard about
the disgraceful state of Covent Garden Market? Of this another
time. For the present, passons.
What was to be my evening's amusement?
Sir, Your Representative unhesitatingly chose The Shaugraun;
first, because I hadn't an idea what the word meant; and, secondly,
because a Sensational Drama is, to my mind, the easiest way of
being amused without any mental effort,—a strong recommendation
for hot weather. A Drama finds more employment for the eyes than
the ears, and an Irish Drama by MR. BOUCICAULT would be sure to
be full of sensational situations, with a relief of Irish fun. This
being settled, it occurred to Your Representative that, at this time
of year, when no one is in Town, he would be able to have his pick
of tables, and the very cream of the menu to himself, at the now
famous Holborn Restaurant. I lounged in. "Can't have a table,
Sir, for another quarter of an hour," said the most civil and obliging
of Managers, "unless you wouldn't mind going into the hot room.'"
He seemed to imagine I wanted a Turkish Bath. But the place was
crammed. "London is here!" exclaimed Your Representative, to
himself. Then a Happy Thought occurred to him: London is
empty—so am I; therefore, we both come here. After dinner,
London will be full—so shall I be.
"Gordon, le menu!" Bring me " Puree a la Tomate," and " Cote-
lettes a la Cardinal" (evidently His Eminence's idea of what's
ood—d i-otre tant£, MONSEIGNEUR MANNING!), while the melodious
'and discourses for me La Gazza Ladra, and that delight of the
waltzers, known as La Manola. Now the fragrant cup of coffee,
and the cigar (here, at a certain time, you can light up, without
quitting the table,—a great luxury to the after-dinner smoker), and
then, all hail McHansom and to Old Drury, to see Her Majesty's
Servants perform The Shaugraun.
Heavens! London empty I Well, if London be empty by this
time of the evening, it must be because Drury Lane is full.
In a stall chair I sat and saw the lately produced Irish Drama.
"' Time writes no wrinkle on thy brow,' MRS. BOUCICAULT,"
observed Your Representative to himself, on seeing the most charm-
ing and perfect delineation of the Irish Maiden trip on to the stage
as comely, as neatly-ancle'd, as bright, as bewitching as ever she
was as Arrah-na-Pogue or the ColUen Sawn. "And Time puts
you up to a good many dramatic wrinkles, MB. BOUCICAULT," was
my next observation, as the piece proceeded. It was all good; all
admirably put together; slow in parts; very little new from begin-
ning to end, not even the perpetual mention of the faithful dog
Tatters, who, without being either heard or seen throughout the
piece, raises the same kind of interest in his behalf as was felt for
"Mein tog Schneider," when MR. JEFFBRBON played Kip Van Winkle.
The Irish Wake was'a novelty, and the Scene a good one. In spite
of the heat, there was no doubt as to the enthusiasm of the audience,
from the first row of the Stalls up to the Sixpenny Gallery, and
assuredly no doubt as to the success of the piece, in which MB. BEV-
EHLET'S scenery was no small ingredient.
It was over at 10 '30, as all principal pieoes should be in these
early closing days, and Your Representative was able to step into

A PIS ALLER.
(Ste latt Number.)
HEN AMANDTTS exclaimed
to AMANDA,
"I think I have hit the
right track,
Let us hurry away to the
Forest—
I don't mean the New,
but the Black.
To pet out of Town in Sep-
tember
Is always a pleasure, I
know,
And that Forest how well
I remember—
In days long ago!
"'Tis a place where you 're
quite clear of tour-
ists—
Of the terrible COOK and
his band!
Who swarm elsewhere like
locusts in Egypt.
And eat up the fat of
the land.
There living is cheaper
and better
Than in most other
forests I know;
Yes! that Forest's the place of all others
To which one should go.
"There the traveller meets with innkeepers,
Who of honesty still have a share,
And don't think that because you are English,
To cheat you is perfectly fair.
Who really seem glad to see you,
And civil—though prices are low;
And whose bills do not always want checking,
As when elsewhere we go.
"You may wander in beautiful valleys,
Refreshed by the cool water's flow,
With the pine forest murmuring above you,
And the rivulet babbling below.
They 've no waterfalls lit up to bore you,
Lake that dreadful Swiss Staubbach and Co.
One is free to see just what one likes to—
0 say, will you go?"
Then AMANDA replied to AMANDT/S,
"Call a Hansom, and let us away,
For London grows dustier, drearier,
And stuffier, day after day;
You have not a Club fit to dine in,
I 've not a soul left that I know;
No Black Forest on earth can be duller—
So do let us go!"

to be so. Ma. BIGGAB, too, has made himself <flstinguished this
last Session, though, perhaps, not in a manner that most persons
would think enviable. And not to prolong the list, ME. DRAX, M.P.
for Wareham, may also claim to rank among our Members of dis-
tinction. He is distinguished as the man who is destroying CJESAB'S
Camp, in spite of the appeals which have been made both to his
pocket and his patriotism.
-
DISTINCTION—WITH A DIFFERENCE.
SAID ME. ROEBUCK the other day, by way of something sharp to
suit the blades of Sheffield,—
"There is no nation in the world BO distinguished u England by a House
of Commons." •
Collectively, we brag of pur " Collective Wisdom," yet our M.P.'s
are not all wise, regarded individually. So we may call our House
of Commons "distinguished" if we like, but we can scarce apply
that epithet (at least, by way of compliment) to certain of its
Members. For instance, the Member for Stoke is a distinguished
man, no doubt, but few of his fellow Members would covet his
distinction. So the Member for Peterborough likewise is dis-
tinguished— but we will not attempt to say for what he is esteemed
SIGNS OF SWEETNESS.
NOW-A-DATS we defy augury. We have renounced, at least, that
superstition. No alarm will probably be created by the following
piece of seasonable intelligence :—
"PORPOISES IN THE THAMES.—During the past fortnight several porpoises
hare been Been disporting themselves below and above London Bridge. One
has been shot near the Cherry Tree Garden landing stage, Rotherhitue, and
another wai captured near Waterloo Bridge, and the carcase has been exhi-
bited in the neighbourhood of the New Cut. The body of a dead porpoise has
for the past week been floating up and down the Thames, to the great annoy-
ance of excursionists in the neighbourhood."
/We are not as our forefathers were when, as Old AUBRET notes in
his Miscellanies,—
"A little before the death of Oliver Protector, a Whale came into the
River Thames and was taken at Greenwich. . . . Foot long. 'Tis laid,
Oliver was troubled at it."
Nobody would now take the appearance of Porpoises in the
Thames to portend that anything was going to happen to anybody.
If such visitors may be regarded as ominous, they can only be looked
upon as good omens. Perhaps Porpoises seen in the Thames are
signs that we shall soon have better fish there—Zoologists, pray
pardon the misnomer of calling a Cetacean a fish. They testify to
the comparative purification of the Thames. A few years ago, the
body of a dead Porpoise in the River would have added little to the
annoyance of excursionists on it. Could yon, dear friends and
fellow-citizens, only contrive duly to dispose of all your sewage,
then there might be a river of Middlesex which would resemble a
river in Macedon and a river in Monmouth likewise, in the special
circumstance that there would be "salmons" not only in two of
those fortunate rivers, but in all three.
Ducks and Dripping.
0 WHITHER hie, the heat to fly P
Of course a sea-side trip!
Perspiring down we steam from Town,
And dripping take a dip.
To wipe us dry, in vain we try,
For drying makes us drip,
And so again we seek the main,
And strip, and drip, and dip 1

Br the composer of an advertisement extracted from the Aberyst-
wyth Observer there is—
WANTED, unfurnished, a small Garden and House, near Aberyst-
w^th, within a mile of the town preferred.—Address , Post Office,
Aberystwyth.
The want of an unfurnished Garden as well as House, above
expressed, may suggest that there are Welsh bulls as well as Irish.
It is, however, obvious that anybody who wishes for a Garden
without furniture can as little delight in leeks as rejoice in potatoes.

THE Newspapers report that, on the evening of Thursday, a terrific
thunderstorm .broke over the north of Scotland. Punch does not
wonder at it, considering how close the weather has been. Were he

spondents.

COSTLY EXPERIMENTS.
HER Majesty's Government, having learned that the loss of the
Vanguard is considered by the nation "a costly but valuable
experiment," are said to be arranging the following "trials," with
a view to obtaining information:—
To Test the Endurance of the Travelling Public. —To allow
accident after accident to occur on the Railways without taking any
steps to fix the criminal responsibilities upon the Companies in
fault.
To Test the Popularity of Recruiting for the Militia.—To repeat
the experiment made this year in Somersetshire, when a Regiment
was kept encamped on marshy ground, in tents half full of water,
for a fortnight.
To Teit the Good-Nature of the London People.—To allow (as
heretofore) all the principal thoroughfares of the Metropolis to be
blocked up annually for weeks, that certain officials may have ample
leisure to turn their attention to the mending of a gas-pipe or the
reconstruction of a water-supply.
To Tett the Power of our National Existence.—To allow our Army
to remain disorganised, and the ship* of our Fleet to be proved
dangerous only to one another.
To Tett British Prestige in Foreign Parts.—To allow our Flap to
be insulted with impunity; to permit, further, our Representatives
(in Asia) to be ill-used, and our Ministers (in Europe) to be out-
witted.
And, lastly, to Test the Patience of the Nation.—To Repeat the
half-hearted policy that was the disgrace of last Session.

—the breakfast that will be eaten at our destination by the thought-
lees and unwary?
Subordinate. Ay, ay. That indeed I have.
Steward. 'Tig well, 'tis very well. And now, Bay. back again to

I must contract. Ha, ha, ha! But let me dissemble. (Enter Im-
perfect Sailor and CHARLES, his Friend.) Good morrow. Gentlemen.
I am the Steward of this pleasant ship. The journey will b« a fine
one. You will contract?
Imperfect Sailor. Faith, yes—if I do starve.
CharCa (hit Friena). Good! very good, indeed!
Steward. You speak truly, Sir—a very merry quip, indeed! Ha,
ha, ha! Your pardon, Sir, out you will be the death of me!_ _But
you will net starve if you contract with me for your provisions.
First, lunch—a slight collation, some simple soup, a broken biscuit,
a little cheese and butter, nothing more. And then a good Old
English dinner: Salmon, meats of all kinds, fruit pies, nuts, cheese,
grapes, plums, pears, and everything you can require.
Imperfect Sailor. A noble meal 1
Charles (his Friend). A noble meal, indeed!
Steward. So you will say when you do see it. After dinner a
rich meat tea—not devoid of kippered herrings. Supper for those
who will. The next morning coflee with the rising sun, to be
followed by a glorious breakfast (with fish, meat, and many eggs)—
a breakfast worthy of our sires. Another good Old English dinner,
and then tea, supper as before. Do you like the picture P
Imperfect Sailor. Much.
Charles (his Friend). Vary much, indeed!
Steward. And for all this—a dozen paltry shillings!
Imperfect Sailor. Done with you. Sir Steward.

done.
Steward. Indeed, fair Sin, then 'it would be imeourtly not to
echo "done!"
[ The contract is signed, and the Imperfect Sailor and C H AJVLES

The Steward regards them with an air of triumph.
SCENE 11.—The Same. Off Greenwich.
Imperfect Sailor. This boat appears to breast the waves most
bravely. See, a gale is springing up. Already we have weather
that old sea-horses, making for Battersea Bridge from Westminster,
would call "dirty." Come, good Sir Steward, is dinner ready P
Charles (his Friend). Yes, indeed,—we ask for dinner.
Steward. Anon, fair Sirs, anon. [Exit, smiling.
SCENE III.—The Same. Two hours later.
Steward. Dinner waits, my masters. Salmon—the finest meats-
boiled mutton, and white-sauced fowls. Come, and be merry.
Imperfect Sailor (struggling with his emotion). Begone 1
Charles (his Friend—ditto). Begone, and quickly!
SCETTE IV.—The Same. TnrB— The evening of the second day.
Steward. I have called you once to breakfast, twice to dinner,
and still you will not come. You are eating nothing. Nay, good
my masters, let me urge you to take somethings-say a tiny piece of
good fat ham, cut thickly, and smothered well in large broad beans
and savoury melted butter.
Imperfect Sailor (faintly). You torture me! Begone!
Charles (his Friend— very faintly). Odear! OdearM Odear!!!
SCENE V.—The Same. The Steamer has arrived in Port. Imperfect
Sailor and CHAHLES (his Friend), having recovered, are seen
eating breakfast.
Imperfect Sailor (giving money). Take thy cash, false Steward,
for food we did not eat—for phantom dinners and for shadowy teas.
Steward. They were there lor you to eat. Why did you not come
for them P I own the passage was a rough one, but was that fault
mine?
Imperfect Sailor. Fault or no fault, begone! Let us enjoy at
least in peace the one poor solitary meal we have been able to eat
since leaving London.
Steward, ^our pardon, fair Sira. For this meal we charge you
each four shillings extra I

WORDS TO THE WISE.
T this season of the year,
when so many of Mr.
Punch's friends cross the
seas in search of distant
lands, "advice to those
about to travel" rises to
a premium. Under these
circumstances, the
Greatest Sage of this or
any other age jots down a
few opinions of more or
less value—opinions which
must be taken for exactly
what they are worth; an
unknown quantity. It will
be seen by the intelligent
that the following advice
is tendered with a view to
enabling the recipient to
avoid what our "lively
neighbours" (by the way,
they are not particularly
"lively" on the Channel)
call mal de mer.
Angelina's Advice. —
Choose a day for the
passage when there is a
magnificent sun-set and
(insist upon this) a glori-
ous moonlight. Pass the
afternoon in reading TENNYSON, and, as the evening star appears,
accompanied by the silvery moon, begin to talk softly (after having
disposed of Mamma, in the Cabin) to EDWIN. In his company, the
voyage will prove a very short one.
Jfr. Decimal Point, M.P.,'s Advice.—A mere question of figures.
Take seventy blue-books, and find out the average of shipwrecks in
the summer months and the average of shipwrecks in the winter
months. Calculate the proportion of shipwrecks to the vessels
(taking care to distinguish between sailing vessels and steamers)
leaving the Fort of London. Repeat the operation with the other
British Ports. Having obtained these figures, be guided by the
result, and choose a day for your passage which would seem to
warrant you in the belief that the statistics, properly considered,
should yield you a fine passage.
Mr. Thomas Nipper's Advice. — Keep it up, 8», k«ep it up.
Choose any day you please. It don't matter a rap whether it s
rough or fine. All you have to da when you come on board is to
order the Steward to bring you a brandy and soda. Drink it. Next
smoke a pipe. This done, drink a quart bottle of stout. After that
take another pipe and another quart bottle of stout. Repeat the
remedy every ten minutes until you arrive at Calais, and when you
get there you will find yourself quite able to hold your own with
the Mossoos who want to examine your luggage.
The Son. Plantagenet Vagueboy's Advtce. — The simplest thing
in the world. Tell your Fellow to choose a good thingummy for
you, and be careful when you go on board to see that the what-you-
may-call-'em is on a line with the thingumbob. Before you turn
in, ask for a glass of what-d'ye-oall-it (mind you don't take what's-
his-name, as it is never good on board ship), and be careful to
regulate the—dear me, what is it ?—by the—h m, I had the word
only a moment ago. If you make no mistake in carrying out these
directions, you are sure to be as right as possible in the very roughest
weather.
Mrs. Materfamilias's Advice.—Before going on board, mind you
have a good meat tea, and be careful to drink a bottle of champagne.
The moment you are in the cabin, put large lumps of ice on your
head and lie on your back, eating every now and then a mixture of
glycerine, ketchup, and camphor. These remedies were furnished
to me by the Family Doctor. I am not altogether sure that I have
given them quite correctly.
Mr. Punch's Advice (warranted infallible).—Take all the above
remedies, and choose the most comfortable berth in the vessel.
Then, if you want to be quit:-', well, oome ashore, and allow the
steamer to start without you.

WONDERS AT A WATERING-PLACE.
(From Oar Special Penny-a-Liner.)
TEE inhabitants and visitors of Shrimply-upon-Sea have been
thrown into a state of considerable excitement by a series of dis-
coveries which have recently been made there. Shrimply-upon-Sea,
as our readers are aware, is a well-frequented watering-place, fast
rising in repute, and its lodgings-letters long have enjoyed the
doubtful fame of being among the surliest and most slovenly of their
kind. It is, therefore, the more singular that the discoveries have
been made there, which we may proceed, without more prelude, to
relate.
The facts are briefly these. On the arrival of the mid-day train
last Monday afternoon (it being, as is usual, about fifty minutes
late), a gentleman from London, of the well-known name of SMITH,
engaged a sitting-room and bed-room, with a good view of the Sea,
for the mutual accommodation of himself and better half. Tne
simple word "APAHTHKNTS" attracting his attention, and no
friendly introduction having led him to the house, MB. Sunn was
much surprised at finding the door opened by a clean and civil
handmaid, instead of by the dowdy and draggle-tailed young person
who usually waits upon the lodger near the Sea. On entering the
house, his astonishment was heightened by finding that the door-
mat was not threadbare, nor the stair-carpet in holes; and his sur-
prise was much increased by the subsequent discovery that the door

of the bed-room could be shut without a bang, and that the windows
of the parlour did not rattle to his tread.
Being induced by these allurements to engage the rooms forthwith.
MB. SMITH was further able, at his leisure, to discover that he could
sit at table without hurting his knees, and could recline upon the
sofa without injuring his back. The easy chair, moreover, was not
devoid of stuftmg, nor fractured in its springs, nor was there any
sign of weakness in its legs. Still more wondrous to relate, the
white curtains were evidently recent from the wash, and upon the
table-cover there was neither trace nor spot of candle-grease or ink!
Subsequent disclosures showed the like result. Both the bed-
room candlesticks were furnished with extinguishers, and the two
decanters were liberally provided with a stopper each. The wall-
papers, though cheap, were not offensive to the eye; and the vases
on the mantelshelf were neither of them cracked. ME. SMITH,
moreover, found that he could even lift the water-jug without an
inward tremble for the safety of the handle, and that his looking-
glass did not need any propping with a hairbrush to prevent its
twirling round upon a sudden while he shaved. His comfort, too,
at meal-times was considerably heightened by his finding that the
pepper-box, when shaken, very rarely lost its head, and that the
two salt-cellars had a spoon apiece. Moreover, the carving-knife
was not lose in the handle, and would actually cut; while, to his
wife's astonishment and infinite delight, the lid of the tea-pot was so
securely fastened, that it never took the liberty to drop into the cups.
Asa climax to his comfort, ME. SMITH likewise discovered that not
a single (nor a married) flea, nor any heavier insect, disturbed his
light repose; nor did his mutton, nor his muffins, nor his marma-
lade, nor his money, stand in any danger of consumption by the Cat.

BAPTISM WITH A BOTTLE.
Two large canoes, according to the Court Journal, eaeh hollowed
from a single log of wood, were one day last week recovered from
the bottom of the Loch of Kinnoord, Aberdeenshire, where they are
supposed to have been lying for more than one thousand years, and
whence another such canoe was fished up some time ago. "The
largest canoe, on being drawn ashore, was christened by the
MABCHIOITESS OF HUNTLT, and a bottle of whiskey was broken over
the bow."
This proceeding suggests questions more or less grave.
Everybody almost will be ready to ask what was the use of
christening a canoe which had been for more than one thousand
years under water? Had it not had more than enough of water—
and that by immersion?
The answer, perhaps, will be that water is not the matter where-
with vesseh-^ol that kind—are wont to be christened. They are
christened with wine or spirits—as in the present instance with
whiskey. In fact, their christening is a baptism to Bacchus.
A doubt might possibly arise in the minds of Ritualists whether
the canoe christened by the MABCOIONESS OF HUNTLY had ever been
christened before; and some of them may, therefore, suggest that
her Ladyship ought to have given it merely a conditional christen-
ing. This point will perhaps be considered by MB. MACKXWOCHIE
and ABCHDEACON DESISON.
What do SIB WII/FBID LAWSON and the United Kingdom Alliance
think of christening a boat by breaking a bottle of whiskey over its
bows? That it was about the best use which could have been made
of a bottle of whiskey? Or, on reflection, will they not be rather
inclined to regard the practice of christening vessels with ardent
spirits or wine a vicious glorification of intoxicating liquors? What
say the Teetotallers and their anti-Bacchic Momus, their Fal$taft\
who has abjured sack and addicted himself to thin potations? That
is, if he himself really practises the dismal abstinence which he
longs to have the power of enforcing upon others.

Mr old Dog stands by the Temple Stairs,
Watching the water's turbid flow.
And he thinks, as the Autumn sunlight glares,
This is a river he ought to know.
He gives a strange suspicious sniff
As he sees the dark stream eddy along,
And dreams of a lazy loitering skiff,
Of a Lover's laugh, of a Lady's song.
First drops of a deluge, heavy and warm,
Under Mariow B rid (re had driven us three,
And we rocked in our boat in the thunderstorm:
If either grew tired, dear Dog, 'twas he.
Ah. the days are here for the straining oars—
The life and the love our toil to crown!
You shall splash, old boy. from the soft green shores
Of a river unsoiled by London town.
INTOLERANCE IN TURKEY.
ACCORDING to the Osservatore Romano, the POPE, the other day,
in replying to an address from some pilgrims, complained that
Catholicism is persecuted in certain countries, especially in Germany
and Switzerland. His Holiness added that—
"Even the Turk, who was lately tolerant, had become the protector of
Neo-tjchiimatici.''
The world at large imagines that, in thus acting, " the Turk " has
only afforded another instance of his accustomed toleration. Not to
protect the "Nee-Schismatics," or any other Schismatics needing
protection, would be intolerance. But the protection of Schismatics,
apparently, in the judgment of the POPE, is the persecution of the
Church. Who shall dispute it, if His Holiness is really the infal-
lible judge of faith and morals P
TITIENS WITH THE TROWEL.
ON Tuesday last week the first brick of the New National Opera
House on the Thames Embankment was laid by MLLK. TITIKNS.
Here was a Brick laid by a Brick; a Foundation bv a Songstress
who has long been a main support of the Opera. The Tinms, in
reporting this event, says, speaking of that Brick of a Vocalist—
"The lady descended by a ntairwny dressed with red doth to that corner
of the foundation which had been chowH for the honour, accompanied by
Jlu. MAPLESON, Mu. FOWLKK, the architect, and some dozen (tentlenipn
well known or interested in music, and all people and things musical, while
about an equal number watched the proceeding! from above."
There is one statement in the foregoing extract which in the
minds of fair readers less thoughtful and more frivolous than those
of Punch, will no doubt have created a sense of disappointment.
MILE. TITIBNS, they are told, "descended by a stairway dressed
with red cloth." Yes, that is all very well to know; but what,
dress did MLLE. Tin KXH wear herself Y This they are not told;
whereas for them, it is just the one point in connection with the
ceremony in which she figured about which they care to know, or
take any interest.

MB. GLADSTONE the other day told the labourers of Ha warden
that in a village like theirs there ought to be an institution which
should—
"Assert its own existence and be a familiar, every-day part of life—an
institution in n-hich all families may take an interest, and in which they may
find opportunities for culture united by judicious arrangements with opportu-
nities of rest and recreation."
Perhaps Hawarden is, as it were, a village in Arcadia peopled
with nymphs and swains, shepherds and shepherdesses, both equal
to sing and prepared to reply in pastoral eclogues. The institution
proper for a village like that would be, of course, a rural Athenamm.
But are not the majority of English villages, unfortunately, so little
like Hawarden that an average specimen of a rustic villager, if
aeked what sort of an institution he understood by that described
in the eloquent language above quoted, would be almost certain to
name the " White Horse " or the " Red Lion "?

A SECOND VISIT TO SCOTLAND.
Being an additional Chapter to " The Tour in the Hebrides."
IB," saidDu. JOHNSON, "let
us take a walk down
Princes Street."
Finding the Great Mart
in so excellent a humour,
I seized upon the oppor-
tunity to put to him many
interesting questions.
"Sir," said I, "pray
•what do you think of
Edinburgh?"
"I think, Sir," replied
the Doctor, "that its name
is most appropriate."
"Sir," I continued, in
a fever of anticipation, "I
shall be very much obliged
to you if you will explain
your meaning in greater
detail."
Dr. Johnson. Sir, I am
sorry that my meaning
should require explana-
tion. I say that the name
Edinburgh is appropriate,
because I find the City
primitive and beautiful.
ADAM and EVE would,
doubtless, have held it in
high consideration had they had the advantage of its possession.
In short, Sir, they would have called it the Town of their Eden, or
Edinburgh."
Mr. Soswell. A pun, Sir!
"It was a pun, Sir!" cried the Doctor, very angrily, and I
hastened to change the subject.
"I am surprised to find, Sir," said I, "that HEB MAJESTY does
not reside at Edinburgh. Do you not think, Sir, that she might
use her Scottish Palace at Christmas time?"
"No, Sir, I do not think so," replied the Doctor, "and I can fiad
no reason for your surprise."
"Indeed, Sir!"
Dr. Johnson. Sir, were Her Most Gracious MAJESTY to dwell at
Edinburgh at Christmas time, she would be put to great inconveni-
ence. Her Most Gracious MAJESTY exhibits excellent sense in
selecting Balmoral for her residence.
Mr. Sostcell. Sir, I trust you do not call in question my loyalty
to the House of Brunswick?
Dr. Johnson. Sir, I do not; I only question your wisdom.
Mr. Bosicttll. Sir, if I do not trouble you, will you explain to me
why HUB MAJESTY should avoid Edinburgh at Christmas time?
Dr. Johnson. Why, Sir, the very branches put up in honour of
the festive season woiild treat her with disrespect!
Mr. Boswell. Indeed, Sir 1
Dr. Johnson. Sir, if Her Most Gracious MAJESTY visited Edin-
burgh at Christmas time, would she not find Solly-rood f
Mr. Bosicell. Another pun, Sir I
"It was another pun, Sir!" cried the Doctor, very wrathf ully,
and I said no more.
The next day we visited Stirling. We walked up to the Castle,
and admired the magnificent view we there obtained of the
surrounding country. We next examined the rampai ts.
"These old walls, Sir," said I, '• must weigh many thousand tons
avoirdupois."
"Sir, replied the Doctor, "you should have said pounds
Stirling!"
"Another pun, Sir!" I exclaimed.
"It was another pun, Sir !" roared the Doctor, and I thought it
best to hold my peace.
The next morning found us at Perth. Here we were received

TVo more Centenaries! The World 'B gone mad
About this latest fashionable fad!
Here 'a a suggestion—why not celebrate
The birth of ADAM ?" Who will fix the date?"
What matter? He was born (ah! more's the pity!)—
Be the exact date left to a Committee;
Say MANNING, HUXLEY, LIDDON, SMITH—a dozen
Of priests and savants equally well chosen;
And when by calculations just and joint
They 've settled that preliminary point,
Doubtless the human race will be quite ready
To answer with subscription stiff and steady.
National pride's a localised insanity,
Our noble selves shown up by reflex vanity;
(That's why the Teutons find such wondrous charm in
The glorifying of their hero, ABMIN ;)
But ADAM all may claim: no learned German
Has yet made out hit name, at home, was HEEMANN.
Our last find is, four centuries ago
Was born the mighty MICHAEL ANOKLO;
So, in pursuance of the latest fancy,
We must proclaim the fact with loud jactinoy. *
Upon our tall talk it might clap a stopper,
Could BUONABOTTI'S spiritplay eavesdropper
At R.A. council-doors! He who shook men so
In the strong days of JULIUS and LOEENZO,
How would that eagle nutter our tame sparrows
Of Art, whose small strength braves small critics' arrows,
With prurience, half voluptuous, half ascetic,
Or puling commonplace, miscalled pathetic,
False medievalism's fantastic flummeries,
Or mock Catholicism's vapid mummeries?
That Titan-thewed exalter of high themes,
How would he rate our Art's distracted dreams,
The petty peddling of its puny toilers,
And all the modern mystery of pot-boilers!
In fight for fame, which now would come off victor—
This giant, or the dainty West-End pictor,
Whose highest inspiration must be sought
In dull or doll-face, tame truth over-wrought,
Or in a well-paid manufacturer's order,
And dealer's fiat, our Art's best rewarder?
What a new light would glow upon " the Line."
From bull's-eye of the fierce old Florentine!
Punch recommends the thought to his Art-brothers,
As fitting this Centenary, of all others!
* Why should not Punch add to the language his translation
of the French "jactanct"?
most hospitably by the gentry and the people. In the company of
our host (a gentleman of the highest consideration in "The Fair
City "), we ascended Kiimoul Hill, and greatly-admired the splendid
scenery.
"A very lovely spot, Sir," I ventured to observe.
Dr. Johnson. Sir, yon are right. Sir, I have here found the
people so kind-hearted, the City so handsome, and the scenery eo
magnificent, that I confess it would give me infinite satisfaction
were I able to call the town in which I was born the place (as the
Highlanders have it) of my Perth!
"A pan, Sir!" exclaimed our excellent host, and I could not
help noticing that he seemed greatly surprised.
The Doctor made no reply, but I could Bee by the working of his
countenance that he was suffering pain.
We came to our journey's end at Wick.
"What do yon think of this place, Sir?" I asked.
Dr. Johnton. Sir, I think that the title of " The Modern Athens"
should be conferred upon Wick rather than upon Edinburgh.
Mr. BosueU. Indeed, Sir 1 May I ask why?
Dr. Johnson. Why, Sir f Sir, you must be very dull. I say, Sir,
that Wick should be called "The Modern Athens."
Mr. lioswell. I confess. Sir, that I am dull, and yet I cannot
perceive why Wick should be called " The Modern Athens " rather
than .Edinburgh.
Dr. Johnson. Sir, you indeed must be dull if you do not associate
Wick with the centre of Greece!
I was silent for a few minutes, and then I ventured to make a
remark.
"Sir," said I. "you once expressed a very strong opinion about
pun-makers. Sir, you asserted your belief that a man who would
make a pun would be capable of picking a pocket."
Dr. Johnson. Sir, I believe so still.
Mr. JJoswcll. And yet, Sir, during the course of our tour, you
have made a large number of puns.
Dr. Johnson. Sir, you have good grounds for what you assert. I
admit, Sir, with a feeling of sorrow, that I have made many puns
during our tour.
Mr. Boswett. Sir, may I venture to ask you why you have made
so many puns?
"Sir," said DOCTOK JOHNSON, "the puns you have noticed are
symptoms of a painful disease, known to men of letters as 'the
Silly Fever.' I attribute the commencement of this melancholy
malady to the depressing effects of a Scotch climate upon a Londoner
in September!"
SING A SONG OF BRIGHTON!
SINS a song of Brighton!
Pockets full of gold;
Skating-rinks, Aquarium,
Piers new and old.
When the Season opens,
The Stars begin to sing;
Wasn't it a famous place
When GEORUK THE FOURTH was king?
Pater, in the counting-house,
Slaves to make his money;
Mater, on the Esplanade,
Spends it, sweet as honey:
The girls are in the balconies,
Showing off their clothes—
And here comes a family
Distinguished by its nose!

IN one sense, Ma. GLADSTONE ia certainly a leveller. According
to a Liverpool paper, two hours before the meeting at Hawarden on
Tuesday evening:—
"Ma. GLADSTOXB wa» engaged in his favourite exercise of felling trees.
For a portion of two duya he hat been wielding the axe upon a large tree in a
lane at tbe outskirts of Uawarden village, and he succeeded in bringing it to
the ground late yesterday afternoon. Those who Baw him aay that he went
to work in true woodman fashion, with his braces thrown off behind him and
his shirt collar unfastened. After completing his task, he walked home with
hia axe alung over his shoulder, and two hours afterwards waa at the meeting,
looking not tired and weary, but quite refreshed with his bodily labour."
The Right Honourable ex-Premier, depicted by a competent
artist in the guise above described on his walk home, would most
admirably serve for a wonder and a sign; namely, for the sign (pace
SIR WILFKED LAWSOK) of the Man in the Moon. Although hia
followers are disunited, he might be suitably represented carrying a
bundle of real sticks. Long live the People's WILLIAM to fell
timber, if he prefers that occupation to the Liberal Leadership and
lopping national expenditure. It ia an employment which may
typify advanced Liberalism; but whilst WILLIAM ia physically
cutting down the Monarch of the Forest, his mind, when not
engaged upon Vaticanism, is doubtless often most profoundly
absorbed with the rumination of the wisest designs for the support
and preservation of the British Monarchy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SOME WONDERFUL WANTS.
THE wants of our f ellow-ereatures, some of them, claim our
sympathy. Others may contribute to our amusement. Subjoined
are a few of the latter kind, extracted from sundry both local and
London journals. The first of the series, for which thanks are due
to a country paper, might be imagined to have appeared in the
Medium, the Spiritualist, or some other of Mr. Punch's necromantic
contemporaries :—
IF MRS. FRANK BEVEN wishes to see her Mother before she is
buried, she will come to her lodgings at once.—Address, &c.
In these days of "materialised" apparitions of the dead-alive at
"dark seances" to those at least who credit them, not the slightest
difficulty can present itself in the idea of a corpse walking to give
anyone wishing to see it a look in. The Ghost does indeed walk
now-a-days out of the theatre, and in the iiesh, which naturally
occasions wags, especially if Scotchmen, to remark that Spiritualism
is all Walker.
A want rather unlikely to be readily supplied is experienced at—
HARTLEPOOL SCHOOL-BOARD.—WANTED, by the above Board,
a FEMALE INFANT PUPIL TEACHER, in her third or fourth year.
—Apply, not later than August 31st, 1875, to, &c.
A female infant pupil teacher in the third or even the fourth year
of her age would be an infant very much more precocious, probably,
than the world has for some time seen.
In another quarter there is—
WANTED, a ROAST COOK, also VEGETABLE MAID, thoroughly
experienced, for first-class Hotel by seaside.—Keply, stating age, wages
required, and where last employed, to, &c.
How a Roast Cook could want wages is a question which has not
occurred to the mind whence this requisition proceeded. It is
evidently in a frantic state. The postulant of a Roast Cook,
perhaps, labouring under the mental delusion that he is a native of
the interior of Africa, contemplates eating his Vegetable Maid,
boiled, together with his Roast Cook. Cooks would really seem to
be delicacies in the imagination of a certain insane class of adver-
tisers. Subjoined is another inquiry for an esculent Cook:—
WANTED, a PLAIN COOK, to Bake. Two Cows kept; no family.
—Address, &c.
The imaginary anthropophagist may be supposed to dream of
eating his baked Plain Cook without sauce.
A story has lately gone the round of the papers about a father
who rescued his child from the jaws of a crocodile; an incident
which, whether it occurred or not. nobody can be surprised to see
reported at this season. Perhaps the account of it put an idea into
the head of a party who announces a—
NURSE "WANTED. Four miles from Tonbridge. Two children.
Able to take a baby from the mouth. £16 and all found. Help given
in the Nursery. Address, &c.
Now that the better sex has so generally taken to swimming, it is
at least conceivable that a Nurse could emulate the exploit of taking
a baby from the mouth of an alligator.
A not uncommon want is expressed in an odd fashion by appa-
rently an eccentric man of letters :—
AE. I. 0. IT.—A Man, possessing the Five Vowels, Ability, Energy,
• Industry, Originality, Usefulness, seeks a Situation of emolument and
trust—Address, with particulars, &c.
Besides the five vowels, initials of the virtues abovenamed, there
are, as LINDLBY MUEKAT says, sometimes W and T. W stands for
Wisdom, which a man can hardly possess who expects any answer
to an application for a place so very indefinitely described as the
one which he means by a "situation of emolument and trust." It
is, however, too probable that he could add Y to his vowels—T for
Yokel.
That same appellation may likewise be deemed applicable to the
gentleman who meditates marriage in the circumstances thus can-
didly stated :—
A Respectable Single Gentleman, age forty-seven, income £50 per
annum, would be glad to correspond with, a Lady, with a view to mar-
riage.—Address 0 26, at tbe Printer's.
0 26, indeed! A better thing than matrimony for 0 26 would be
the employment which he could doubtless obtain by replying to the
notification following:—
WANTED, a good-looking DONKEY, free from vice, to draw a Bath
Chair.—Apply, &c.
Or this situation might also suit the man of five vowels and vir-
tues, if the virtues are unqualified, and the advertiser is indeed
justly desoribable as a " donkey free from vice."
Let us conclude this string of wants with the want of a droll
individual who wants to sell a very extraordinary animal:—
JUST ARRIVED, a WILD BOAR, from the Brazils. Perfectly tame.
U To be SOLD.—Apply on board, &c.
This is obviously an advertisement to which there would be a
peculiar impropriety in appending tbe notice that "No Irish need
apply." Who indeed but an Irishman could expect to buy a tame
wild boar? And, of course, if PAT came to be a customer for such
a bargain, he would find that he had to deal with a compatriot.
It is a pity that advertisements such as the foregoing are dispersed

SWEETS OF THE SEA-SIDE.

Shingleton, near Dulborough.
SYMPATHISING MB. PUNCH,
WITH the desire of enjoying a few days of tranquillity and
a few dips in the sea, I have arrived and taken lodgings at this
"salubrious watering-place" (as the guide-books choose to call it),
having heard that it was quiet, and possessed of a steep, cleanly,
and bathe-inviting beach. As to the latter point, I find that fame
has not belied it; but surely with a view to tempt me into suicide,
some demon must have coupled the term " quiet" with this place.
Quiet! Gracious Powers of Darkness! if this be your idea of a
quiet spot to live in, I wonder what, according to your notion, need
be added to its tumult to make a noisy town. Here is a list of aural
tortures wherewith we are tormented, which may serve by way of
time-table to advertise the musical attractions of the place :—
1 A.M.—Voices of the night. Revellers returning home.
1'30 A.M.—Duet, "Jo t'amo," squealed upon the tiles, by the
famous feline vocalists MADEMOISELLE MINETTE and SIGUTOB
CATTERWAtTLWI.
2 A.M.—Barc-arole and chorus, "Sow wow wow" (BACH), by the
Bayers of the Moon.
3 A.M.—Song without words, by the early village cook.
3'30 A.M.—Chorus by his neighbours, high and low, mingling the
treble of the Bantam with the Brahma's thorough bass.
4 A.M.—Twittering of swallows, and chirping of early birds,
before they go to catch their worms.
4'45 A.M.—Meeting of two natives, of course just under your
window, who converse in a stage-whisper at the tip-top of their
voices.
5 A.M.—Stampede of fishermen, returning from their night's work
in their heavy boots.
6 A.M.—Start of shrimpers, barefooted, but occasionally bawling.
7 A.M.—Shutters taken down, and small boys sally forth and
shout to one another from the two ends of the street.
7'15 A.M.—" 8o-holes! fin* fresh so-holes!"
7-30 A.M.—"Mack'reel! fower a shillun! Ma-a-ack'reel!"
8 A.M.—Piano play begins, and goes on until midnight.
8'25 A.M.—Barrel-organ at the corner. Banjo in the distance.
9 A.M.—German band to right of you. Ophicleide out of time,
clarionette out of tune.
9'30 A.M.—" Pa-aper, mornin' pa-aper! Daily Telegraft!'
9'45 A.M.—German band to left or you. Clarionette and cornet
both out of time and tune.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
10-15 A.M.—A key-bugler and a bag-piper a dozen yards apart.
11 A.M.—Performance of Punch and Toby, who barks more than
is good for him.
1V30 A.M.—Bellowing black-faced ballad-bawlers, with their
banjoes and their bones.
Such is our daily programme of music until noon, and such, with
sundry variations, it continues until midnight. Small wonder that
I have so little relish for my meals, and that, in spite of the sea air,
I can hardly sleep a wink. I shall return to Town to-morrow,"f or
surely all the street tormentors must be out of it, judging by.the
numbers that now plague the sad Sea-side.
MISEHBIMUS.
THE HOUSE AND THE HOME
OR, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF.DECORATIVE ART.
By LEONARDO DELLA ROBBIA DE TTTBOB WESTPOND TCMPKYNS,
ESQ., 8.A.8., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the Dulli-
dillitanty Society.
OLD furniture fanciers should avoid the localities where their
taste has been especially consulted by the vendors of antique
specimens.
Let them keep their eyes open, and remember that there is all the
difference in furniture between a venerable appearance and a veneer-
able appearance.
I know a clever man who can manufacture Elizabethan chairs and
tables for a mere nothing, and turn them out as good as old. [Name
and address on receipt of twelve stamps.]
To furnish Actively is to carry in your own furniture yourself,
and place it where you like.
This action need not be
limited to your own furni-
ture. You can carry in other
people's. Only, to make such
an action worth your while, it
should be carried into your
own house.
To furnish Passively is to
give a general order, and let
the Upholsterer carry it out.
while you lie on a sofa and
give yourself no further
trouble about the matter.
This is what a tradesman
likes, whose motto is " Order
is Heaven's First Law," and
he will write to you to inform
you that your "esteemed
order" will receive every
possible attention.
The conscientious Uphols-
terer will carry out your
instructions, will carry in
your furniture, will (as is
said by SHAKSPEABE, who
furnishes us with quotations)
"set down ought in malice"
and carry one, and go on carrying]"one, until he calls on you with
hia Little Bill—


DECLENSION OF NOUNS AND ADJECTIVES.
The following Nouns, with their disqualifying Adjectives, should
be declined altogether by
every student of my Gram-
mar of Decorative Art: e.g.,
Nominative. — A broken
old cheap chair.
Possessive.—I have this
broken old cheap chair
[implying, "And I will sell
it to you a bargain ").
Objective.—l don't want
your broken old cheap
chair.
But remember your
French polish, and inva-
riably let such a qualified
Noun be declined with
thanks.
The Verb " To Furnish."
this Verb, as of all
similar Verbs, there are
three kinds, the Active, Passive, and Neuter: and it is also divided
into Regular, Irregular, and Defective.
Neuter.—This relates to the tint of the papers, coverings, blinds,
curtains, &o., &c.
First, in Wall Papers.—You. must cautiously guard against the
wall-papering so common now-a-days in external mural decorations.
The Art Student, having avoided the above, must be very careful
in his choice of papers.
The first paper for choice will of course be Punch. Cela va sans
dire. For your Dining-room you can't do better than choose certain
Low-toned papers. An example of
A Low-Toned Paper is the Englishman. I should unhesitatingly
say, do not bring this into your dining-room or drawing-room, or
library. There are a few other low-toned papers, whose tone is not
quite so low as this, which may perhaps suit the taste of the present
day. ~A propos of low-toned papers, it is a marvel to me (the author
of this work) that the Authorities (whoever they may be) do not ask
and you gay, "Dear me, how he's grown! I had no idea he was
so big!"


me to decorate St. Paul's. Here is my suggestion for the Whisper-
ing Gallery: give it a low-toned paper. The Deans and Canons are
welcome to this hint gratis. I trust the Canons are canons of good
taste. But to resume.
There are some papers, which, for their washed-out appearance,
might be called the weakly papers. But do not forget that, accord-
ing to the sort of paper on which you ultimately decide, so must you
choose your articles. A light paper will require light articles: a
heavy paper, heavy articles. A neutral-tint would represent the
political opinions of a Liberal-Conservative, and if this idea is care-
fully acted upon throughout, what opportunities for conversation
will be afforded! The paper, whatever its tone, will speak for
itself, and will speak for its proprietor.
Papers and Borders.—The question of borders will, perhaps, only
occur for the parlour. Of course you must decide by your means
whether you will have parlour-borders or not. Borders are placed
at the extremes of papers; but this is less a question of extremes
than of means. If you do have parlour-boarders, humour them,
and avoid "crossing the boarders" in any way.
(To be continued.)
MELLOW miLOSOPHY.
"I HAVE ceased," remarked a blast cynic, "to care enough about
my species to take any pleasure in saying disagreeable things."

"Literature—that is a very high flight. Science—that is a higher flight

YOUR pardon, dear GLADSTONE. We seldom dispute.
Are you rightly reported? Punch cannot be mute.
As a recognised leader and lover of Letters,
He will not admit the Professors his betters,
Or let ARCHIMEDES fly higher than HOMER,
Through whose infinite realm you 're a fortunate roamer.
Oar NEWTON reached Science's summit, we know,
But on Poetry's peak was great SHAKBPEABE below?
Imagine the wrathful discussion 'twould kindle
If we had to decide 'twixt the Laureate and TYNDALL I
Punch, Proctor of Letters, designs no defiance
To the absolute definite value of Science;
But he holds that by logic 'tis clearly deduoible
That the Pen beats retort and alembic and crucible,
Beats compass, theodolite, sewing-machine,
Creates or suggests them, and tells what they mean.
It gives us the easiest record of thought,
And without its strong aid all our Science were nought.
September's long lights cross the lawn and the garden,
You, statesman retired, enjoy autumn at Ha'arden;
Punch hopes, when you 've felled the due number of trees,
On the turf by the Castle there, sitting at ease,
You'll just reconsider that saying of yours—
Since you 're one whose terse apophthegm always endures.
The different grooves which are occupied scan:
See, Science takes Nature, but Letters take Man—
Take Woman as well, a most exquisite field!
Think over that matter, dear GLADSTONE, and yield.
The Binomial Theorem's something to strike; it
Was clever, no doubt—I prefer As You Like It.
ARCHIMEDES was deuoedly wise on the cone,
ARISTOPHANES' Birdt suit me better, I own:
And though Science must have her keen Surgeons with lancets,
Her Astronomers sage to watch Venus' s transits
(From boudoir to drawing-room, doubtless, and back again),
Yet as long as life lasts men will tread the old track again,
Will follow the Pen, that can wing them afar
To regions beyond the least visible star,
Will smile just awhile at the Science experiment,
Then welcome pure Poetry's music, depth, merriment.
Since School-Boards have come a great change there mast be,
And even ex-Premiers have learnt Ride of Three:
So, as Letters to Science is Dinner to Lunch —
Thus verily sayeth
Yours verily,
Head and Foot.
THE following advertisement, extracted from a newspaper, might,
if the Compton Hotel at Liverpool were not a respectable Inn, be
capable of misconstruction :—

SIB WILFRED LAWSON is a merry man. Indeed the adjective and the sub-

Merryman; a Mr. Merryman, but for the handle to his name. Say, as a
Frenchman would, Sir Merryman. The Member for Carlisle has constituted
himself a sort of Clown in the Temperance Ring. He may be regarded as the
United Kingdom Alliance Yorick, whose jibes and flashes of merriment, in
Liquor Law Debates and at Total Abstinence Tea-parties, are wont to set the
tables in a roar. Such a Yorick, it may be suggested, would not have done in
Denmark. We don't know that. Our Jester's jocosity is a great marvel von
may suppose—he drinks no wine. Doesn't he F See The Draper's report of an
entertainment lately given by a "MB. GEORGE MOORE, in his Cumberland
Home," whereat—
"A Champagne luncheon was served in a large marquee.
"Sm WILFRID LAWSON-, M.I'., presided; MR. MOOUF. sat on his right
"SIB WILFRID LAWSOX proceeded to say—' Gentlemen, I hare to propose the health of
our worthy host. . . . And ... let us pay honour to our worthy host—the kind, the
hospitable, the generous, the popular MB. MOORE; and I call on you now to drink his very
good health with all the honours.'
"The toast was drunk with great enthusiasm."
Drunk in what? Champagne, doubtless, by the majority of the drinkers.
But by SIB WILFBIB LAWSON P As President of a Champagne lunch party, one
would think, in Champagne too. At any rate, he not only countenanced people
in drinking Champagne, but also warmly exhorted them to drink it in drinking
a health which he well knew very few would drink in water. The President
of the United Kingdom Alliance, in presiding at a Champagne lunch, proposing
a toast to be drunk with all the honours in an intoxicating liquor, and pre-
sumably drinking it himself, has joked a joke immensely surpassing the most
brilliant witticism he ever uttered; and the best of it is that the joker of this
high joke is the Mover of the Permissive Bill in the House of Commons, and the
Permissive Law Orator, who, liquoring up in Champagne, goes about clamouring
for leave to be enabled " to rob a poor man of his beer."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

NUPTIAL REFORM.
na Pall Mall Gazette
records a marriage in
humble life, transacted
with an exemplary
simplicity. The bride-
groom, a MR. JONES,
employed at the Old
Brentford Gasworks,
had to be sent for
thereto from Church, to
which he came from his
work ooatless, with
tucked-up shirt-sleeves,
and smoking a pipe:—
"There being nobody
present but the bride and
another woman, JONES was
asked who was to give the
bride away, when, turning
to the sexton, he replied,
with much feeling, 'You i
can do that, Guv'nor.''
On the conclusion of the j
ceremony the happy pair
adjourned to a public-
house, and after 'partaking
of some refreshment,' they |
departed—the brida to her
new home, and JONES to bis
work at the gas factory."
How glad manyyonng
men of the middle and
even higher class, meditating matrimony, would be to be enabled to contract it j
with as little ceremony as what attended the nuptials of MR. and MRS. JONES ! j
Of course, their customary morning dress including a coat, they would not come
to Church from their employment in their mere shirt-sleeves, and if they
adjourned from the altar to a public-house, it would be such an one as a decent
restaurant or hotel. Thence the bridegroom, going like MB. JONES about his
business, would go, after having partaken of a moderate refreshment, sober of
course, and there would be nobody to remain behind drinking intoxicating
liquors. The bride, satisfied to go home and wait there for her husband, would
spare him all the expense of a wedding tour.
Too much praise cannot be given to Mas. JONES, and
to Mas. JONES'S relations, if she have any, for the readi-
ness with which they entered into MB. JONES'S views
with regard to hymeneal ostentation. She is doubtless a
sensible woman, and may be expected to make a wise
man as happy as any husband can be who has to work
for his living.
The subject of funeral reform has lately undergone
much appropriate discussion in the dead season; but that
of nuptial reform is equally suitable. Indeed, as a
philosopher pleasantly remarked at a wedding breakfast,
the marriage list in the newspapers, involving that of
the births, represents the conditions necessary to those
of the obituary.
MONSTERS AND BOGIES.
ARTTLLEBT, MB. MELTON tells us in Paradise Lost, was
originally employed by a certain Generalissimo of Legions,
one of which, considered to be under his special com-
mand, is that of the Inns of Court Volunteers. The
original cannon appear, from MB. M.'s account, to have
been monster guns, and may well be imagined to have
resembled the 81-ton gun thus described in the
Times.-—
"The gun is mounted for proof on a sleigh or carriage com-
posed mainly of iron—portions of the cheeks only being of wood
—and carried on two six-wheeled bogie trucks. The bogies are
pivoted under the sleigh by centre-pins working in square iron
blocks, having springs fore and aft of each block."
The ordnance wherewithal the military Old Gentleman
or Veteran, ex-Archangel, and Commander of the Rebel
Hosts, assailed the Loyal troops under Major-General
St. Michael, was invented by a Bogy, and constructed,
as well as carried, by Bogies. It is natural to suppose
that the Bogies introduced their own forms into the
design of their field-pieces for ornament, like the dragons
which decorate the now comparatively little, but formerly
enormous, mortar in St. James's Park. A good sense of
congruity and keeping was displayed in mounting the
81-ton gun on bogies. We trust that the bogy-borne
gun will play Old Bogy with all at whom aggression may
compel us to fire it.
GENEROSITY AND G&AMMAB SCHOOL.
ACCORDING to a letter in the Times, by MB. J. HABDCASTLE, the
Trustees of Felsted Grammar School, Essex, and the Visitor, the
BISHOP OF ROCHESTER, have been behaving in a most generous and
gentlemanlike manner to the REV. W. S. GBIGNON, Head Master of
the School for nineteen years up to last June, when the Trustees
and the Bishop summarily sent him about his business.
It is true MB. GBIGNON may pretend to have done the School
some little service. He raised the number of boys from si vty-cight
to two hundred and sixteen. Many of them have gained University
and College distinctions. One of his pupils was last year's Senior'
Wrangler. When first MB. GRIGNON came to Felsted School, it •
was in a bad way. Under the clever management of a House i
Steward, it had fallen into debt eight hundred pounds, for which .
the Trustees were personally responsible. MB. GBIGNON, at their I
request, took the House-Stewardship on himself, paid off the debt,
reduced the School expenses twenty per cent., and put an end to
complaints of long standing about the diet. But then, finding
double work too much for his strength, he gave the Stewardship up,
se that his self-sacrifice was not entire. The Trustees hereupon
appointed their own Clerk Steward. He was seventy years old, and
lived six miles off. So he visited the School once a week, and his
duties were almost wholly entrusted to, and equally neglected by,
the Matron,
But, of course, no complaints from parents or guardians were
made to the Trustees. MB. VELEY, their Steward, was also their
Clerk. Complaints as to the Steward's department would have had
to.be carried to them through the Clerk. MR. VELEY would have
had to complain of MR. VBLEY. MB. VELET is no Essex calf.
MR. GBIGNON did not follow MB. VELEY'S wise example.
In August last year diarrhcoa and sore throat broke out in the
School. In February last, scarlet fever. The drains, among other
little matters, had been neglected. One boy. who sickened of
scarlatina, was placed by the Steward or the Matron in the ward-
robe-room, whence clothes were distributed to all the boys—certainly
a slight mistake. All this may not have been quite the thing; but
was there any occasion to make a fuss about it'?
Nevertheless, in March, MB. GRIGNON sent the Trustees in a pro-
test against the mismanagement of the School by the Matron and
the House Steward. The Trustees perhaps took time to consider
their reply. But MR. GRIGNON could not wait longer than till
April, when he wrote a circular to the parents and guardians of the
boys, disclaiming responsibility for the state of the School, and
apprising them of his protest, and its failure!
That was bad enough—in the eyes of the indignant Trustees.
But MB. GRIGNON was not content with that. About the same time
he actually applied to the Charity Commissioners for an inquiry into
the state of the School and its Trust!!
Accordingly, on the 6th of June last, the five Trustees—who
ought, by the scheme of the School, to be eleven, but have omitted
to fill up vacancies—met, and passed a resolution, subject to the
approbation of the BISHOP or ROCHESTER, cashiering MR. GRIGNON.
The Bishop approved of this noble and righteous resolution. It was
communicated to MB. GRIGNON six days afterwards, when he was
in the midst of a school examination.
MB. GRIGNON immediately forwarded a protest to the BISHOP OF
ROCHESTER. DR. CLAUGHTON took no notice of it. MR. GBIGITOS,
in a fortnight, wrote to DR. CLAUGHTON again. DR. CLAUGHTON
answered him through MESSRS. DAY AND HASSARD. Prompt and
polite.
MB. HABDCASTLE says that MR. GRIGNON is fifty-two years old.
received only £500 a-year, "is thrown on his own resources, and
dismissed with a quarter's salary, with as little compunction as if
he had been a drunken butler or a poaching gamekeeper." But had
he not committed high treason against the majesty of the Trustees P
Had he not been guilty of flat blasphemy in murmuring against
their inscrutable ways? So, apparently, thought BISHOP CLAUGH-
ION. It is difficult to say which is the more admirable in this busi-
ness—as told by MR. HARDCASTLB—the magnanimity, considerate-
ness, and courtesy of the Trustees of Felsted School, or the behaviour
of the BISHOP OK ROCHESTER. The Trustees, however, did perhaps
only what might have been expected of them; but the oenduet
ascribed to the Bishop must be acknowledged to exceed everything
that could have been imagined. It is, indeed, lovely if true.

(Aberdeen Station, Saturday, September 18,1875.)
THE account, in the Times, of the journey
of the PHINCE and PHHTOBSS OF WALES, on
their return from Scotland to Sandringham,
records the following extraordinary inci-
dent :—
"Aberdeen was reached at nineteen minutes
past twelve, or one minute late. OQ the platform
were a few of the public officialsand an unusually
large concourse of the general public, embracing
representatives of the leading families of the
county and city."
WE VE heard of Scottish pride,
And something have believed,
But such a scene at Aberdeen
Must show us we 're deceived;
For rank and caste disowned,
This rather stiff-backed nation
Have taught us all, both great and small,
Our duty in our Station.
The Prince's train arrived—
What met the princely gaze?
A great surprise for Royal eyes,
In these decorous days:
Officials, steady men,
The Public, in high feather,
The county swells, the city belles-
Embracing all together!
BLOWING GREAT GT7N8.
THE 35-ton Gun, named at its birth " The
Woolwich Infant," was a strange monster;
well, the 81-ton Gun may be fairly said to
be a little Stranger.
CUE EDUCATIONAL PROGKESS.
AT STTNGITON not long since, on the meeting of the Sohool-Board,
there ensued a brisk debate as to the duties of their Clerk. Certain
members pleading ignorance as to what they had a right to expect
their Clerk to do, it was explained by the Chairman that :—
"The duties of the Clerk were to give notice of meetings, and to mention
special subjects to be considered; to keep the accounts, and to hare them
printed twice a year; to make any returns which the Education Department
asked for, or which he required, and, under any circumstances, to make them
once a year. The Clerk might appear for the Board in legal proceedings, and
he must keep his office open at all reasonable hours that the rate-payers might
inspect the books."
In addition to these trifles, it seemed to be considered that a
Clerk should be a sort of general overseer and educational police-
man, as well as a man of all work to the members of the Board.
Said one speaker, somewhat shrewdly:—
"Certain duties were defined, but the Act did not prevent other duties
being done by the Clerk, which it might be proper to put on him in order to
save a multiplicity of officers."
Considering their nraltiplicity of duties, candidates for Schqol-
Board Clerkships ought to be examined, with the view of testing
thoroughly their fitness for the place; and, as there seems to be no
knowing what a Clerk may be called upon to do, some few "fishing"
questions like the following should certainly be put to him :—
1. What is your age,'and weight, and power of physical endur-
ance?
2. Can you write shorthand, and are you acquainted with the use
of the boxing-gloves and globes P
3. For how long will you be satisfied to pocket without grumbling
a salary not exceeding ninety pounds a year P
4. Can you clean boots, and will yon be too proud, if called upon,
to do so P
5. Who dragged whom, and when, round the walls of what?
6. Explain in a clear manner, and also with conciseness, the
differential calculus, the origin of the digamma, and the atomic
theory as applied to neutral salts.
7. Have you any taste for Art, and does your wife prefer chintz
or cretonne for the covers of her drawing-room?
8. Cite the leading cases where the legal cestui qui trust of a copy-
hold assignment has established a contingent claim to the remainder,
under the Act abolishing the use of lease and release P
9. When were you last vaccinated, and how much did it take P
10. Have you a good temper, and are you prepared to keep your
office open until midnight, for inspection by the rate-payers, and to
supply them gratis with pipes and gin-and-water whenever they
drop in?
11. In case of sudden illness of any Teacher m your district, could
you, at five minutes' notice, undertake to give instruction in Welsh,
Russian, Greek, Turkish, trigonometry, therapeutics, geography,
gymnastics, Hebrew, High Catch, singing, dancing, Chinese, and
thorough bass P

13. Explain and give the derivations of the following:—Cepha-

pay for it?
15. Transpose the first six bars of the music of the Spheres,

To the Admiralty Circular, of July 3lst, to Captains of H.3L Shipi,

"EH! what!" cries BRITANNIA, rubbing her eyes,
With a look of exceedingly startled surprise,
"' Supplementary Slave-Trade Instructions'?
I thought I had settled that little affair.
A pretty pottscriptum, my Lords, I declare!
But I don't see my countersign set anywhere,
To this newest of naval productions.
"My will, I conceived, was made clear to the world,
That, wherever my Union Jack was unfurled,

That's a fair and square rule which all quibbles should quell,

It would tax a Sea-lawyer its bearings to tell:
One thing, though, is plain,—it 8 a blunder!
"No need for tall talk about ruling the waves,
But, at least, my ' broad rule' does not recognise Slaves,
Whether stretched o'er green land or blue ocean.

VERY IMPORTANT!
BT some unaccountable mistake, the following "Extra Parlia-
mentary utterances " have not been reported in the London News-
papers. Mr. Punch, ever anxious to do full justice to the wisdom
of our Legislators, begs to supply the omission. It will be noticed
that the following speeches do not differ materially from the orations
so frequently telegraphed to the Metropolis for publication at this
pleasant season of the year:—
TOEYSHIBE.
On Monday last SIB PEHCT PEOST, Bart. (M.P. for the Eastern
Division of this. County), attended a meeting of his Constituents,
held in the Banqueting Hall of the Blue Lion Inn and Hotel, Doll-
borough. The- Hon. Baronet was supported by the greater part of
the Bench of Magistrates, the Town Clerk, and others of the nobility
and gentry of the neighbourhood. So great was the interest taken
in the proceedings, that at one time no less than fifteen persons were
present in the magnificent saloon provided for the auspicious
occasion by ME. CIDEEBEES, the enterprising landlord of the Blue
Lion Inn and Hotel at Dullborough.
The Hon. Baronet said that he had great pleasure in meeting his
Constituents once again. Although he had not had occasion to
speak in the House of Commons during the past Session, those of his
Constituents who had perused the local Conservative paper of Dull-
borough would have noticed that his votes had been always given
for those measures which had received the sanction of that Great
Man, that Magnificent Statesman, that Excellent Financier, his
Bight Hon. friend ME. DISRAELI. (" Hear, hear ! ") He had much
pleasure in telling them that the country was prosperous, and that,
at the present moment, England, he might say Great Britain, was at
peace with all nations. (Cheers.) There had been some heavy rains
in the summer, but now they seemed to be enjoying fine weather.
("Hear."') This was very satisfactory. ("Hear, hear .'") He
could further say that the great question of granting a Government
grant for the improvement of that noble structure—the Dullborough
Town Pump (cheers) was now under consideration. (Enthusiastic
cheering.) Nay, more, he had been assured by one of the Ministry
of this great fact. (Great cheering.) He knew the question of the
Dullborough Town Pump was a matter of deep interest in the
County, and he was glad to be in a position to give them such
welcome news. (Cheers.) The Member of the Ministry ("hear,
hear ! ") from whom he derived his information very kindly added
that the Cabinet, as a body, extended their great appreciation of the
Town Pumps of Dullborough to the Pumps of Toryshire collectively
and individually. ("Hear, hear!") He was pleased that a
Merchant Shipping Bill had been passed, and was very well satisfied
with the Budget. He had nothing more to say. (Cheers.)
After the meeting had listened to two or three speeches of purely
local importance, a vote of confidence in SIR PERCY PEOST, Bart.,
M.P., was passed unanimously.
GLITTEBBOEOUGH.
On Tuesday last ME. WACO, M.P. (of the firm of MESSES. WA.OG,
CASH, AND WA.GG, General Merchants), met his Constituents at the
new hotel recently erected in this rapidly rising town. The mag-
nificent saloon was crowded in every part. On the platform were
the Mayor and MESSES. THOMPSON, SMITH, SNOOKS, BBOWN, JONES,
and ROBINSON, ME. ALDERMAN WH.KINS, and other persons dis-
tinguished in the worlds of Fashion, Literature, and Art.
ME. WAGG said that he felt like the Clown in the Christmas
Pantomime when he observed "Here we are again!" (Loud
laughter.) Well, he had nothing much to say. (A laugh.) His
friend the Prime Minister (a laugh) had at length reached the
summit of his ambition—what he might call a "Dizzy" height.
(Shouts of laughter.) Peace seemed to be the order of the day—not
the DET OF AIGIEBS (" hear, hear!") in China, This was most
fortunate, as everybody knew that China was a very brittle article.
(Loud laughter.) He was glad, therefore, that the Government had
been tender with China. (Renewed laughter.) He did not think
that a single Act that had received the Royal Assent during the
past Session could be of any service to anyone. ("Hear, hear! ")
He could not give his reasons for this assertion—was he not a
Liberal? (Cheers.) As a Liberal, he claimed the right to do, to
say, and to think what he pleased, without consulting anybody.
("Hear."') Of course he excepted his Constituents, whose will
was at all times his very sternest law. (Cheers.) As for the Ses-
sion, like old Mother JfiMunl's cupboard—there was nothing in it.
(Shouts of laughter.)
A vote of confidence in the Hon. Gentleman was then passed in
the customary manner, and shortly afterwards the meeting separated
in great good humour.
POCKETBOEOUGH.
On Wednesday the MABQTJIS of PEHKTBOY (grandson of His Grace
the DUKE OF CTTRFEW, to whose title he is the heir) met the tenants
of Pooketborough at a luncheon given in the Duke's grounds.
The Noble Marquis said that ne had much pleasure in meeting
his Grandfather's tenants. (Enthusiastic applause.) Their greeting
was so very kindly that he wished he could call them his friends-
hut that he could not do, as he regarded them as his enemies. He
palled them enemies because he knew perfectly well that he did not
in the least represent their opinions. (Murmurs.) They were
enemies to the Constitution of their country. (Renewed murmurs.)
He justified his assertion by pointing out to them that they made no
sort of use of that noblest of institutions, the Ballot. (Loud mur-
murs.) His opinions, he knew, were not snared by his Grandfather.
(Loud and long-continued cheering.) He told his Grandfather
(renewed applause), years ago. when he (the Noble Marquis) was a
boy at Eton—in fact it was in 1873—that without the Ballot the
country would be lost. As to the past Session, his Constituents, or

rather hia Grandfather's tenants, would notice that he had been
Connted Out when he had made an attempt to abolish the Esta-
blished Church and the House of Lords. (Cheers.) "Well, as he
said before, he knew that he did not represent them. That was
their fault. Why did they not get another man? (Loud murmurs.}
In common fairness, however, he must warn them that so lonp as
he retained a seat in the House of Commons he would certainly
work with might and main to change England from a Kingdom into
a Republic. (Loud murmurs.)
Ma. PAID WELL (Agent to His Grace the DTJKE OP CURFEW) ad-
mitted that the sentiments of the Noble Marquis were perhaps a
little extreme. They were charmingly expressed; but perhaps,
taking everything into consideration, they could scarcely be said to
be quite the sentiments of a High Tory. Now they were all High
Tones in that town (loud cheers), and as High Tones he was quite
sure that they would not forget that Poeketborough, from time
immemorial, had been represented by the heir to the estates and
title now belonging to his (Mit. PAIEWELL'S) noble employer, His
Grace the DUKE OF CURFEW. (Enthusiastic cheering.) He there-
fore begged to move a vote of entire confidence in the Noble Marquis
who had so ably represented them, during the past Session, in the
Junior Chamber of the Legislature.
A vote of confidence in the views of the Noble Marquis was then
passed unanimously amidst much enthusiasm.

startling sounds disturbing

PUNCH "stood on the bridge at midnight," when Big Ben was-
tolling the hour,
And an Autumn moon was gleaming through the mists above the
Tower.
The Bridge was that self-same structure on whose wreck MACAU-

Will sit to portray, at no distant day, St. Paul's as a ruin hoary.
Thinks Mr. Punch—" Should that Maori bring a bit of the Bridge
his view in,

greatness in ruin.

MISTAKES ABOUT SCOTLAND.
(Contributed by a Converted Cockney.)
IT is a mistake to believe that every Scotchman, when
he goes to Edinburgh, immediately walks down Princes
Street clad in the ancient costume of the Highlanders.
It is a mistake to believe that the piece de resistance
at every Scotch dinner-party is a Haggis.
It is a mistake to believe that a Scotchman does not
enjoy a joke every bit as much as an Englishman.
It is a mistake to believe that a Scotch Sabbath in the
country is a whit more triste than an English Sunday in
the provinces.
It is a mistake to believe that a Scotchman sets a
greater value upon his " bawbee" than an Englishman
upon his shilling or an American upon his dollar.
It is a mistake to believe that inns in Scotland are
dearer and less comfortable than hotels in England.
It is a mistake to believe that we have a City in
England that can compare favourably (from an archi-
tectural point of view) with the town of Edinburgh.
It is a mistake to believe that it always rains in the
Isle of Skye.
It is a mistake to believe that there are no more
"Fair Maids" in the houses of Perth.
It is a mistake to believe that Hampstead Heath is-as
beautiful as Dunkeld.
It is a mistake to believe that the Caledonian Canal is
at all like the Serpentine.
It is a mistake to believe that Aberdeen is less im-
posing in appearance than Chelsea, or Islington.
It is a mistake to believe that the countrymen of SCOTT
and BURNS do not appreciate the works of Sn AKSVKA RE,
MiLTOW,.BrRON. DICKENS, THACKEBAY. and TENNYSON.
And, lastly (this is added to the Cockney's list by the
wisest Sage of this or any other age), it is the greatest
mistake of all to believe that Mr. Punch does not like
and respect (in spite of an occasional joke made at their
expense) the kindly, homely, sound-hearted people who
live North of the Tweed.

CONSERVATIVE EDUCATION.
MB. PUNCH,
SIB,—I hear people call the present Ministry Tories. Sir,
I say they are not even Conservatives. Here is MB. CROSS actually
opening an Educational Bazaar at Orwell, and making a speech in
which he tells workpeople that they" might as well starve their
children as not send them to school! MB. FOBSTEB could not have
said more, and I doa't see a pin to choose between FOBSTER and
CBOSS, nor indeed between DJSKAKLI and GLADSTONE, for the matter
of that. Education! Why, wasn't it DIZZY himself who boasted that
he had educated his Party, and now his Party begins to talk, not only
of educating the People, but of compelling them to be educated.
He has given them a Liberal education" with a vengeance. But
he husn't educated me. I hold to the belief that popular education
is as dangerous politically as it is pecuniarily expensive. It will
only make the working classes dissatisfied with their lot in life.
Don't tell me education will prevent drunkenness. A sufficient pre-
ventive of drunkenness would be the Stocks, if we had a genuine
Conservative and Tory Government to revive them amongst other
good old Institutions insanely abolished. I know there is no hope of
such Conservative legislation as that. Some say CROSS is what they
call in advance of his colleagues; but, no doubt, they will soon all
give in to the cry for education to keep in office—the time-servers!
They 're all alike to Yours, in disgust,
AJT UNEDUCATED Tour.

REGINALD DEUCEACE wants an Engagement in a decent Family.
Snobs objected to, and needn't come bothering. He doesn't intend
to do any dirty work, and he is going to get up when he likes; but
in return for a liberal salary, he will teach his Employer any or every
game of cards that exists, give him a few wrinkles for Fool, make
him a book on the next Derby, and teach him to mix American drinks.
MEDICI'S (Middlesex Hospital) has studied this question, and sees
that Helps are only to be used when there can be three or four of
them. He knows three other first-rate fellows (all ploughed in last
Exam.) who would be very happy to join him, and get an Engage-
ment in a comfortable house (as their present lodgings are beastly),
where there is a billiard-table. In return for their grub and bed,
they will all be delighted to_ perform operations on their Employer,
to write him as many prescriptions as he likes, and if they kill him,
will dissect him in the most artistic manner. Troublesome dogs or
cats in the neighbourhood promptly vivisected. N.B.—No old
frumps, or Ladies who object to Beer or Birdseye, need apply.
HON. FnzROY PLANTAGENET has heard of this sort of thing, and
thinks it will suit him down to the ground. He has no objection to
living in anybody's house, and being treated as one of the Family,
if he is paid a pot of money for it.
F. 0. CLARK wants an Engagement in a Provincial Family
desirous of entering Society. His terms are high, but he is worth
the money, having been in good Society all his life. He will teach
the men of the family to walk, talk, bow, ride, and generally
behave themselves everywhere, from the ring at Doncaster to a ball
at Buckingham Palace. He will impart instruction to the girls in
dancing, flirting, and polite conversation. If his efforts meet with
success, he will furnish his employers with some good introductions.
JOHM (generally called JACK)'HAKE AW AY, having come a howler
over the Leger, is stumped. Wishes to come across a muff, who
wants it taken out of his horses. Doesn't mind tooling a drag or
tandem in the Park, but objects to a one-horse brougham. Will
drive his Master to fires, but won't wait outside theatres, and will
be blowed if he '11 put on livery. •
WOOD B. BENEDICT thinks it's all very well talking about ninety
million (he is not quite certain about the figures) superfluous women,
but there seem to be a jolly lot of superfluous men. He is one. He
has got five hundred a year, and only spends a thousand, but he
wants to marry and settle down, only the girls of the present day
are so sharp. If any of this superfluous stock (under forty, and
with more than two thousand pounds a year) will marry him, he
don't mind. P.S.—He never advertised before, bat, while he is
about it, will do the right thing. N.B.—Reduction made on taking

AN UNLUCKY OMISSION.
IT is much to be regretted—considering the comments called forth
by the letter which COLONEL PONSONBT, by HBE MAJESTY'S com-
mand, lately addressed to the Commodore of the Royal Victoria
Yacht Club—that the letter was not printed in its entirety. It was
written on two pages, the second of which seems to have been
detached by some unlucky accident before the letter reached the
papers.
Punch is glad to be able to snpply the missing passage:—
"At the same time, the QUEEN has commanded'me to remind all
Officers of Her Majesty's Navy of the importance, especially in the
navigation of much-frequented waters, of keeping a careful look-
out, and never, under any circumstances, exceeding such a rate of
speed as will leave them in thorough control of their vessels. Above
all, the QUEEN hopes the Officers of her Navy will bear in mind that
the maritime rule of the road—according to which vessels under steam
shall give way to vessels under sail, as being less manageable—
admits of no exception, whatever be the dignity of the flag or rank of
the passengers on board of the vessel on which steam is employed."
Had this passage of the letter accompanied the portionTalreaay
made public, we should probably have heard nothing of the disagree-
able comments provoked by the publication of the first part only,
without the context.

MORE CIVIC IMPROVEMENTS!
Is consequence of the very successful manner in which the plan
for the degradation of London Bridge has been devised and accepted,
several proposals for the further improvement of the Metropolis will
be brought forward at the next meeting of the Common Council :—
1. To avoid the detour of St. Paul's Churchyard, it will be pro-
posed to throw open the Cathedral as a public thoroughfare.
Carriages and carts will paes through at a walking pace.
2. Owing to the complaints made by several members of the
Common Council, who are also members of St. Stephen's Club, of the
interruption to their slumbers by Big Ben, a suggestion will be
made to the First Commissioner of Works to pull down the Clock
Tower, and melt the bells into something useful.
3. Temple Bar being both dangerous and unsightly, it will be
proposed to leave it in its present condition.
1. It will be proposed to excommunicate J'unch for having dared
to impugn the taste of the Common Council!

THE HOUSE AND THE HOME:
OR, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.

By LEOITABDO DELIA ROBBIA DE TUTOH WESTPOND
ESQ., S.A.S., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the DuUi-
dillitanty Society.
THE Wall-flower Pattern for a ball-room is charming.
Of course you will decide what sort of ball-room it is to be before
settling your pattern.
Shall it be a cricket-ball-room or a tennis-ball-room? A soft
ball-room, or an elastic ball-room?
Patterns are at once suggested by
these distinctive appellations.
Summer Boom. — Decorate this cool
apartment with a frieze all round.
Get a friezingly polite artist to do
it for you. You can speak of this
as "An ice room." It yon don't
speak of it like this, you won't have
your little joke, and you must have
your little joke. [N.B. — Yon needn't
speak of it at all unless you like.]
A modern writer on paper patterns
says there's "nothing so dreary as
an unrelieved pattern." I beg to
differ from him; an unrelieved Sen-
try is far more dreary than an un-
relieved pattern. If it's damp, the
Sentry, unrelieved, must stay where
he is; not so a pattern of unrelieved
colour on a wall, which, in the damp,
can run, and ultimately go away
altogether.
However, if you want to be kind
to a iault, you can relieve your
patterns as they do the sentries at
certain times of the day. The Artist
can (if he likes, and yon can shoot
him if he won't do what you want)
indicate this idea on the walls of the
room by portraying a soldier saluting his sergeant and guard, and
saying, with SHAKSPEAKE (who need not be in the picture), "For
this relief, much thanks."
Gold. — Gold can be judi-
ciously introduced into
papers. Gold can do any-
thing it likes, in fact. The
effect on the papers will be
— well, start a daily paper,
and see for yourself. Ex-
perientia, &c.
Having omitted to make
any allusion to furniture
during this disquisition on
papers, I consider it advis-
able to introduce at this
point a simple rule— forming
part of my present Art
Grammar — with regard to
Furniture Verbs, which are
divided into
Regular, Irregular, and
Defective. — The Regular is
divided into regularly good
and regularly bad. The rule
is to avoid the latter.
The Irregular chiefly ap-
plies to clocks, which are, of
course, included in the items
of furnishing.
The Defective will be evi-
dent from the accompanying
illustrations.
1. The Necessity Table. "Necestitas nan habet Lsss."
2. The Old Greenwich Pensioner Chair. Lost a leg. Lost an
arm.
Yon send one to be mended. The Carpenter tells yon that it is
"weak in the back." To which you will reply, "Then it won't be
back in a week?" This is a side-splitter which will send him into
tight fits.
With the above furniture "thrown in," I can now beg your
attention for a very few moments to the important question of
Mural Decorations. — There are intra-mural and extra-mural
decorations. The latter are divided into two classes — (1) those

extra-mural decorations which you put up yourself but don't want,
and which are simply extra; and (2) those put up for you, outside
chiefly, by streets boys gratuitously.
These latter (specimens of which may be seen on the Pompeian
remains, and belonged also to the earliest
school-time, or out-of-school-time, of
youthful Egyptian arts) consist of such
designs as a portrait of yourself (not
generally nattering), suspended in the air
to a gallows, after the model of the hang-
man whom Mr. Punch, in the old legiti-
mate show, hangs on his own gallows-tree,
with some legend underneath, professing
to give his (the artist's) opinion on you
personally, as, for instance, " SMITH is a
fool I" "Old SMITH is a Hass!" and so
forth.
Intra-mural decoration of the same genre
will be supplied gratis, if you have a
small family in your house, and allow
them lead pencils. They will practise
spelling on your walls. Encourage this
talent u you will. By so doing, you may
be rearing up pupils of a school of Decora-
tive Art of which your countrymen will
be proud (a " Proud Countryman" would be a fine subject for the
wall of a rustic villa, or would make a good sign for an old inn),
and, if this satisfies you,—you are very easily satisfied, and at a
small cost. (To be continued.)

MACBETH AT THE LYCEUM.
TrrFRK is little to be said about MB. IBVING'S Macbeth which has
not been said already, with quite unusual accord, by the critics in
the papers. It is a picturesque and energetic performance, based
upon and working out a very distinct conception of the murderous
Scottish thane, as what the Scotch call a "fey" man; that is, a
man borne helplessly along in a career of crime under the sway of
an irresistible fate. But MB. IIIVING seems to have overlooked", or
not to admit, that the impressiveness and pathos of such a spectacle
depends mainly on our sense of the height of nobleness from which
the " fey" man has fallen; and that the strength of the tide which
sweeps him down will be gauged involuntarily by our feeling of the
thews and sinews with which the swimmer buffets and bears up
against it. Those who can conceive SHAKSPEAEE'S Macbeth as thin,
pale, and haggard [in face, meagre almost to emaciation in frame,
shrill and high-pitched or hollow of voice, feverish and restless of
movement, and hysteric of temperament—those who can clothe in
suoh hectic and sickly flesh and blood that " minion of valour," that
"Bellona's bridegroom" who drives in flying swarms rebel kernes
and gallowglasses before him, and unseams the merciless Macdon-
Itl from nave to chaps—the Thane whose praises, as a valiant
warrior, are poured out, post on post, before the king, till he
acknowledges him chief of his chiefs—the noble Macbeth, who has
"won golden opinions from all sorts of men "—may be prepared to
accept MB. IBVINO'S impersonation, if not as consistent with the text
of SHAKSPEABE as it stands, at least as within the limits of fair
But all must see at once that this is Macbeth without the back-
ground of stalwart strength and material courage against which his
murderous deeds, if they are to have any relief, must stand bloody
off; it is, as has been well said, an "abject" Macbeth, exhibiting
before us, in the utmost elaboration, the extremities of physical
terror, and the most palpable and pitiable writhings and wrenchings
of remorse. And, as in Hamlet, MB. IBVOTG expunged those passages
of the text which he found in the way of his interpretation, so, in
Macbeth, the introductory scene, of which Macbeth's fighting feats
are the theme, is bodily struck out, and we lose even our old friend,
"the bleeding sergeant," because, for the actor's purpose, the
thought of Macbeth as a mighty warrior must not be called up in
the spectators' mind.
MB. IBVING has gallantly—whether wisely or not is another
matter—chosen in Macbeth a part, with which every one of his
personal peculiarities seems to jar. Now there are some physical
barriers from which the utmost histrionic energy and courage must
fall back battled and beaten. Suoh a barrier nature seems to have
raised between the part of Macbeth and the person of MB,. IBVING.
He is, by physique and temperament, absolutely unfitted to embody
a rude, stalwart, fierce, fighting, northern warrior of those stormy
times when gracious Duncan ruled. His thews and sinews neem un-
equal to the wielding of heavy bill and battle-axe—his body to the
weight of bnll's-hide targe and ringed byrnie. The exhibition of
physical terror and cowering, shrieking remorse, with no suggestion
of strength and manhood behind it, becomes repulsive. We turn
from it with a kind of loathing, largely dashed with contempt.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Even his courage in the last Act—when he is tied to the stake, and,
bear-like, must fight the course—is feverish, tetchy, and irritable,
more like the waspish petulance of an angry sick woman than the
concentrated fury of a strong man driven to despair.
In the presence of this pervading character of MB. IBVING'S
conception, all details of odd or ungraceful habits of pose, or
movement of body and limbs, all peculiarities and tricks of
elocution—the sudden shrillings or sinkings of voice, the gut-
tural slurring of some lines, or the long-drawn dragging out of
others,—are hardly worth insisting on. They are only tolpe noted
as mannerisms already fast growing into affectations, which, like
the abuses attacked by ME. BUBKE'S famous Bill, "have increased,
are increasing, and ought to be diminished."
Miss BATEMAN'S Lady Macbeth had many points of high excel-
lence. She, too, has peculiarities of elocution which sometimes
detract from the effect she aims at—as in the Sleep-walking Scene,
the slow,drop-by-drop utterance of her "Who-would-have-thought-
the-old-man-had-so-much-blood-in-him!" But her strong mark-
ing of the different moods of the wicked woman, from tin- intense
determination of the First Act to the breaking strength and failing
spirit of the Third, was both original in conception, and powerful in
execution. But she should distinguish, by a more decided change of
voice and manner, her evil brooding over Macbeth's letter from her
triumphant greeting as she throws herself into his arms; and she
should be more careful to assume a serpentine smoothness and lowly
courtesy of subject and hostess as she bows before Duncan.
Punch must again protest, as in the case of Hamlet, against
arbitrary changes of scene running in the teeth of the text.
What is the meaning of bringing Duncan and his train in front of
Macbeth's Castle by moonlight, and setting the Castle at a distance
which deprives of all meaning the reference to the martlets' nests
under its eaves and cornices? Is it not evident that SHAKSPEABE
meant to conjure up in the minds of his audience of the Globe—he
had no scene-painters—a close view of the grim, grey Castle front,
basking serenely in the pleasant air of summer afternoon, as if in
contrast to the dark deeds of blood and horror about to be wrought
within it after set of sun.
And if there must be not a "moving grove " only in the last Act,
but moving miles of the country between Birnam and Dunsinane,
at least the management might give us the comfort of a set-piece to
mask the raw, straight edges of the shifting cloths.
Punch must congratulate MBS. BATEMAN on her courage in
getting rid of the chorus of witches, even at the cost of MATTHEW
LOCKE'S music, and bringing back the weird sisters to the original
mystic three—The Fates of Macbeth—the Eumenides of modern
tragedy.

not the experiment be tried of attaching to her, at low tide, a
number of those gentlemen who are so clever in floating Public
Companies? The Blue Book of the Foreign Loans Committee

recently published will suggest the eminent members of the com-
mercial world whose extraordinary powers of flotation especially
qualify them for the task. Even should they fail to float the
vessel, and, in the attempt, go under themselves, the loss would
hardly be irreparable. Yours,

SIB,
I HAVE given intense thought to the problem of raising the
hull of the Vanguard, and, up to the present time, I have oome to
the firm conclusion that one of the obstacles to successfully floating
it is its great weight; and another may be found in the fact that
there is a large hole in the vessel's side.
Hoping my humble efforts may assist any ideas which may have
been formed by others on the subject, I have the honour to be, Sir,
Yours reflectively,

THAT there are difficulties to be met in raising the Van-
guard cannot be disputed, but with money and encouragement there
are f e w things impossible to the modern Engineer. Let the Govern-
ment place £1,000,000 at my entire command, and give me a baro-
netcy before I commence operations, and I think I may promise
that the task of floating the noble ship would appear leas formidable
than it does at present to Yours faithfully,

DEAR Sat,
I HAVE a firm belief that successive shocks, from seaward,
produced by a huge battery charged with a sufficient number of
Electric Eels, would have the effect of driving the Vanguard into
shallow water. Hoping you will not think me officious in making
this suggestion,

OF course, long before this, you have come to the same
conclusion as myself with respect to raising the Vanguard.
You may just as well try to raise the Devil.
Nothing can be done except to censure the Iron Duke and give
the Vanguard what the Court Martial has already given her

of the Iron Duke, in other words, everybody concerned in her loss
—a good "blowing up." Yours, sternly,

He needs a stout rein, a strong hand on the bridle,
And brain .'—the Bonassus!—to guide his good will.
Small blame to the juvenile Titan, but trainers
Who boast of their favourite's power and pace,
If they hope of the "National Stakes " to be gainers,
Must learn that good jockeyship counts in the race.
This sturdiest servant of civilisation
May stay to the end if they handle him well;
But we want fewer " spills" ere a satisfied nation
Claps hands to this chorus of whistle and bell.
We may drink to the health of our Giant of Fifty—
Punch empties his bumper—yet gladly would find
His trainers of tall-talk a trifle more thrifty,
While yet in the race Matter handicaps Mind.
Brute force is not all, nor material progress;
While soul 'a at a stand, stoutest sinews are vain,
And Civilisation an iron-toothed ogress
Oar Titans may toil for, but cannot sustain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

AMONG THE FISH.
(Meditations in the Brighton Aquarium.)
EWABE the gigan-
tic Turtle. He is
"dangerous to
touch." Clearly,
therefore, this in-
teresting creature
may be viewed in
three different
lights—as a thing
"to eat, drink,
and avoid."
What will he his
ultimate fate?
Will the Direc-
tors and their
Staff always be
proof against
temptation?
Suppose some
morning he is
missing—and the
coroner's juris-
diction does not
extend to these
poor friendless
animals — what
grave suspicion
will rest on those
who have access
to the building at times when the public are not admitted! Watch
long enough, and you will see an instructive sight—Aldermen,
Common Councilmen, and other great municipal functionaries
devouring the Turtle—with their eyes.
Aquariums make us acquainted with strange tankfellows. When
the Golden Eel thus unbosomed itself about the Mud Fish to a friend
of both parties, it had reason on its side. A compromise has since
been effected. So long as the Mud Fish has the privilege of being
the companion of the Golden Eel, it is only to be accosted by its
scientific name— Lepidoiiren.
Have Ichthyologists reflected what may be the "effect of captivity
upon the fish r Bo the Crabs become more crabby, and the Chub
more chubby? Do the Carp carp at the passing remarks of the
tench, and are the Plaice more or less common-place than when
they had the range of the Channel? We trust there is no founda-
tion for the report that the Cray-fish occasionally go crayzy.
The Company should provide intelligent and well-informed
persons, of good manners and address, to guide the pronunciation of
visitors. Even the best of men may go astray when he is confronted
with the Axolotl for the first time; and we know that Anemones
and Zoophytes have been stumbling-blocks to many generations,
and are yet far from being household words. But there is no excuse
for anyone calling a Gurnard a "Cnnard," or making the g in
"Conger" soft. It would increase the public comfort, if one of the
officials were to proclaim in a loud voice the proper pronunciation
of Octopus every half-hour during the day.
Do not raise your expectations too high. Be prepared for a little
disappointment. The Sea-horses are under fourteen hands. It was
hardly fair to the Paradise Fish to give them such a pretentious
name. The Telescope Fish are scarcely six feet long, ana the Boar
Fish, whatever rumours you may have heard to the contrary, show
no indications of tusks.
Great sympathy was expressed for the Toper. Not a drop of any-
thing to drink but salt water. Common humanity might surely
prompt the management to do something to alleviate such suffer-
ings. One suggestion we will presume to offer. Put Bass in the
same tank with Toper, and there will be no more discontent. The
Monk Fish might be safely trusted to see that there was no approach
to excess.
_ Smokers should not neglect the Pipe Fish, and an important sec-
tion of the artisan class will do well to make acquaintance with the
Weevers.
We could not learn whether the Skates had been to the Rink.
The Herrings and Sprats are together. We waited some time,
hoping to see a long standing question satisfactorily settled, but we
had to leave without seeing a sprat catch a herring.
Happy Aquarium which shall first exhibit a live Sea Serpent, and
happy those who may hold shares in the concern! The only chance
for any rival establishment would be to secure a Mermaid.
A NASTY DOSE.—The thing to put London Bridge to-rights
(according to the Common Council)—" GREGORY'S Mixture."
A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN.
(A Chapter from Punch's " Pilgrim's Progress.")
PUNCH dreamed a dream.
He was walking in a dreary and desolate country. On either side
of the dark-coloured road were stunted, leafless hedges. Every now
and again there was a mile-stone, and once or twice he saw a pool
of murky and stagnant water. The sky was hidden from sight by
heavy lowering clouds, and although he knew that it was mid-day,
everything seemed to him to tell of night. The hedges were black,
and so were the mile-stones; so, also, were the pools of stagnant
water. In the distance he could see tall factory chimneys belching
out huge volumes of smoke, and the air was dense with a yellow and
loathsome fog.
And as he went his way, he came upon a house—a house which
those who saw it might have called a hovel. The glass of the win-
dows was shattered, or replaced by rags or boards; the door was
broken, and all but hingeless. The little garden space was fall of
weeds, and in the weeds lay broken bottles.
Punch was curious. He pushed aside the broken door, and looked
in. He saw a miserable room nearly bare of furniture. The table
had three legs—one shorter than the others. A couple of tottering
chairs, a heap of rags to represent a bed, and the inventory was
complete. Seated in this room were a couple of half-naked children,
with hollow cheeks and large hungry eyes. As the door was pushed
open, these children raised their hands in silence, and Punch felt,
as he looked upon them, that they had no strength to cry, even for
the bread for want of which they were pining away.
Punch was glad that he was only dreaming. He left the hovel,
and walked on. Again the road seemed to be utterly deserted.
The factory chimneys were still adding their volumes of smoke to
the dense overhanging clouds. He saw no living creature. He
murmured to himself, Where are the men of this strange country?
Where are its women?"
His question was answered by a voice from under the smoke-cloud.
"The women are over yonder, working," and a dirty finger was
pointed at the factories.
"Do you work?"
"0, yes," was the reply. "I am a Fogger. It is I who beats
down the wages of the wives. You see, women can't combine like
men, and I can get them to take almost anything. Lor bless you,
they don't stand out for tommy and beer. They think themselves
lucky if they can get anything to feed their hall-starving families
with! We give them eight shillings, instead of twelve—and quite
enough too, for the sort of work they do."
"Is it not good work?"
"Well, it's hard work." And then came a laugh. "Making
chain-cables is no joke. But, as to its being goml work, well, that
must be proved at sea."
"And what are you?"
"Can't yer see—a man I"
And, for a second time, Punch was glad that he was only
dreaming.
Punch walked on. He grew nearer and nearer to the smoke, and
soon the air resounded with the sounds of heavy blows, soon the
walls were red with the glare of fiery furnaces. Punch entered a
workshop. What did he see?
Haggard and slatternly women doing unwomanly work. Some
were carrying heavy weights on their neads: some were wielding
iron hammers,—all were labouring beyond their strength; all were
more like African slaves than English maids and matrons. Health,
youth, and beauty, maidenliness and mannerliness, had all been
sacrificed in the hard struggle for bread.
"And have these poor creatures no fathers, brothers, husbands,
lovers, to save them from this P"
Again Punch was answered.
"I have a brother, but he was taken years ago from the Tavern
to the Hospital"
"I have a husband, but he spends all he earns in gambling and
drink."
"I have a lover, and when I get bigger wages he will take me to
the church, and then I '11 work for him instead of father."
And once more the air resounded with the din of the heavy ham-
mers, and once more the walls were red with the glare of the fiery
furnaces.
And for the third time Punch was glad he was only dreaming.
So Punch went his way, and now he found himself in a crowd of
respectably-dressed people, and the crowd of respectably-dressed
people cried to him with one voice—
Punch, we complained of you, years ago, for painting the I'lack
Country too black. But we were wrong, and you were right!"
And they spoke so loud that Punch awakened from his dream,
to find himself seated in his study, his right hand resting on a book
with a blue cover, inscribed " Factories Inspectors' Reports" (Ms.
BBEWEB on the Iron Manufacturing Districts, S. W.),

JUBILEE."
SCENE—A Chimney Corner. SMKLFcrarotrs
and MUNDUNGDS croaking behind pipes.
Smelfungus. What a fuss and parade
.hey have been making up there at Dar-
ington, to celebrate the starting of the first
passenger train fifty years ago on their
Hail way!
Mundungus. Wonder how many railway
accidents have happened from then till now?
Smelfangus. A Railway Jubilee! Why
Jubilee? What is there to rejoice at in the
nvention of railways?
Mundungus. Atter fifty years' ex-
perience, less, I should think, than there
.s in a golden wedding.
Smelfungus. A fast would be fitter than
a jubilee for either anniversary.
Mundungus. Railways have brought, on
;he whole, more mourning than joy.
Smelfungus. Yes. As undertakers and
mourning-linendrapers especially may say,
Good for Trade."
Mundungus. Mourning, even sincere, ia
always much aggravated by mourning bills.
But, how many persons have Railways
made to mourn in earnest, turned out of
bouse and home?
Smelfungus. By cutting through their
parks, and spoiling the beauty of land-
scapes.
Mundungus. Hush! You '11 be called an
aristocrat it' you talk like that. Say, rather,
cutting through their shops, and ruining
business, for wnich no award could possibly
compensate.
Smelfungus. So individuals are sacrificed
to the community.
Mundungus. As though by cannibals.
Smelfungus. And with what results?
Mundungus. Of course we are told, un-
bounded Prosperity and Progress.
Smelfungus. Beef atone shilling and six-
pence a pound.
Mundungus. Fowls nine shillings a
couple. Geese eleven shillings each.
Smelfungus. Oysters three shillings a
dozen.
Mundungus. 4Continually increasing
excess of population.
Smelfungus.. Competition and struggle
for existence in every walk of life daily
getting more and more wolfish.
Mundungus. Greater and greater dif-
ficulty for young men to get on.
Smelfungus. And young women to get
off. What with the expensive habits and
dress which have resulted from Railways
and prosperity, what young fellow of the
middle class not in business, and not doing
a roaring trade, dares to marry? In these
days, and at this season, nobody, however
silly, would venture, even in the news-
papers, to propose marrying on twojhundred
ayeai.
Mundungus. Well; there, perhaps, is an
evil tending to work its own cure. If half
the population would only keep single, its
rate of over-growth would decline. Mean-
while, the lot of the unmarried is all the
better—if they would only think so.

A PLEA. AGAINST THE BEE.
A CEKTAIN " C. R." has announced in the Times the
discovery that the Bee, from time immemorial reputed
a model insect, the embodiment of virtuous diligence
and industry, is, instead of that, a truculent and noxious
pest, no better than a wasp, a cockroach, or an earwig.
This discovery is news indeed. It is also just now par-
ticularly seasonable, as this is the season of fruit, espe-
cially of monstrous pippins and gigantic peaches and
pears. "C. R." accuses Bees not only of devouring his
own wall-fruit and that of other people, but also of
haying wantonly pitched into and stung himself, and
being prone, without provocation, to fly at and sting
mankind. His denunciation of Bees has naturally raised
a swarm of gainsayers about his ears, and the character
of the Bee may, perhaps, be considered to have been
satisfactorily vindicated; but, if "C. R.'s" assault upon
it could have been sustained, the immortal poem in
which it has been extolled by DR. WATTS would have to
be re-written. Instead of. being represented as an ento-
mological pattern to a moralising infant, the Bee would
deserve to be proposed as a study to an idle and vicious
boy, abandoned to the indulgence of a swinish appetite,
and glorying in it. The verses of DB. WATTS might
then be replaced by the following perversion of his
panegyric:—
THE BEE.
How doth the gorging greedy Bee,
Destructive little brute,
Hum all day long from tree to tree,
And spoil the choicest fruit!
Behold how deep she scoopa a cell,
When peaches she attacks,
In nectarines and peare as well
How big a hole aha makes!
Likewise to eat and drink my fill
I should be happy too;
For Nature has disposed me still
But little else to do.
In prog and grub, by turns with play,
Might all my life be past,
Till I, perhaps, should come to weigh
Good fourteen score at last.
However, there is every reason to think that "C. R."
has mistaken a sort of blow flies for Bees, and that,
having, as he says, been stung by a Bee, he is labouring
under melissophobia.

and the proletarians go on increasing and multiplying like Colorado
beetles, and overrunning the earth with their Cockney abodes.
Mundungus. Impregnating our air with noxious gases and
noisome effluvia.
Smelfungus. Turning our rivers into filth.
Mundungus. That is, turning our filth into the rivers.
Smelfungus. And what are we the better for railways? What
have we got by them that we had not in the old coaching times?
Mundungus. Facility of locomotion, as the phrase is—quick con-
veyance from place to place. But then one place is daily getting
more and more like another-^and all more like suburbs of London.
Smelfungus. Railway receipts grown to £22,000,000 in one year!
What have we got to show for it '<
Mundungus. About the greatest blessings I see from the railway
system, and steam, and commerce, and communication between man
and man, are cheap pine-apples, gutta-percha, and india-rubber.
Smelfungus. In the meanwhile an Ironclad costs above half a
million, and we have to reconstruct the Navy every two or three
years.
Mundungus. Every shot or shell we may have to fire from a
monster gun, bang will go from five-and-twenty to fifty pounds.
Smelfungus. Public expenditure and private extravagance, grasp-
ing and squandering, increase yearly, at the rate of thousands of
millions. And every now and then there is a smash for three or
four.
Mundungus. All the fat's in the fire.
Smelfungus. And — with the Iron Horse all over the civilised
earth to feed—all the coals. There at least they will be before long.
Prosperity is blazing up, but when our coal-nelds are exhausted?
Uow then P
Mundungus. Prosperity will have burnt itself out.
Smelfungus. Darlington won't be much inclined to celebrate a
centenary Railway Jubilee, I take it.
Munihmgus. If the world lasts so long.
Smelfungus. Let us hope it won't.
Mundungus. We shan't, at any rate, old man.
Smelfungus. No; long before that we shall both of us have fallen
martyrs to bile and indigestion.
Mundungus. And so have got rid of a world of sorrow, stink,
steam, rheumatism, ritualism, roguery, and rhodomontade!
Smelfungus. And a good riddance, too!

GRACIOUS COMMUNICATIONS.

IT is rumoured that, in consequence of the general satisfaction
given by two of their most recent official communications, the Lords
of the Admiralty intend sanctioning the invariable use of the
following form of "letter, to he used in all cases where the recognition
of assistance rendered at sea becomes absolutely necessary. The
same form to be adopted by the Board of Trade :—
WhiieJiall, [Date].
SIB,—I am directed by the Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's
Admiralty to inform you that, in consequence of your heroic
gallantry in saving the crew of the ship , during a heavy gale,
you have made it necessary for their Lordships to take notice of the
matter; and, on your enclosing a stamped receipt for Five Pounds,
and a letter of thanks, I shall be directed to forward to you, in the
course of the next financial year, the above-mentioned sum, together
with a concertina, or any other article you may. within the above-
mentioned period, select from the Lowther Arcade.
Their Lordships, however, desire me to warn you that, should you
at any future time render like services at sea, you must not look for
any further recognition of such service.

Now that the REV. "W. 8. QBIONOW has heen dismissed by the
Trustees of Felstead School, a new Head Master will probably be
mjuired for that once rising educational establishment. Mr. Punch
has great pleasure in preparing an Examination Paper which should
be immediately submitted to Candidates for the appointment. A
single answer in the affirmative to any of the following simple ques-
tions will of course be an ample proof that the competitor does not
possess the necessary qualifications for the peculiar position he
wishes to occupy.
1. Do you think it advisable that a Head Master should call the
attention of Parents and Guardians of his Pupils to the existence of
a neglected fever raging ia a School over which he has (theoretically)
the supreme control Y
2. Do you think a Head Master, who properly represents his
subordinates, should feel aggrieved if his Assistants are told to go
to the Matron to get the cheques for the salaries due to them''
3. Do you think a quarter's notice, given with the scantiest
courtesy, an improper or insufficient warning of dismissal, when
addressed to a respectable Clergyman, who has spent twenty of the
best years of his life as Head Master of a School he has rescued, by
his exertions, from debt and obscurity?
4. Do yon think that the aged Clerk of the Trustees of a School is
an improper person to become the Steward of the School of which
his employers are the Trustees—do you, in fact, object to his filling
two positions, in which the duty of servant and master are strangely
jumbled together f
5. Do you think there should be any appeal to a higher power in
the case of the Trustees neglecting to perform the duties they were
appointed to perform?
6. And, lastly (most important of all), in the event of your being
appointed Head Master of Felstead School, will you expect to be
treated with the courtesy and respect generally accorded to a person
claiming to be a scholar, a gentleman, and a divine?
NATIONAL MISTAKES.
(By a Dyspeptic Neietpaper-Reader.)
IT is a mistake to imagine that water-tight compartments can
be relied on to keep iron-dads afloat, if they strike on a rock, en-
counter a ram, or are struck by a torpedo.
It is a mistake to imagine that our Naval Officers understand their
business.
It is a mistake to rely upon our Navy as a first line of defence
against invaders.
It is a still greater mistake to rely upon our Regular Army as a
second.
A greater still to trust to the Militia as a possible third.
And the greatest of all mistakes to regard the Volunteers as any-
thing better than an armed mob.
It is a mistake to imagine that the British Flag is the standard of
freedom, and that slaves setting foot upon British ground (including
the quarter-decks of Her Majesty's ships) "never, never, never shall
be slaves" any more.
It is a mistake to imagine that with the freest and fined.
Constitution in the world, we are free from the lowest political
vices.
It is a mistake to believe that our houses are our castles, so long
as we live under the sway of Bumbledom.
In fact, it is the greatest mistake in the world to believe now-a-
days that BBITANNIA rules the waves, or that JOHN BULL li;n the
slightest right to turn up his nose at the follies, shortcomings, or
vices of his neighbours.

THE OTTOMAN OUT-AT-ELBOWS.
So the Turkish Government is obliged to come to a
composition with its creditors^ whom it proposes to pay,
for the neit five years, half in cash and half in paper!
This is the result of gross extravagance, especially in
two principal branches of lavish expenditure-money
squandered to satisfy the demands of the Harem, and to
pay for the Fleet. Both the ships and the ladies are
more ornamental than useful. It is difficult to say which
the SULTAN has found the more costly—his Ironclads or
his |Silkenelads. This cool act of repudiation will swell
the ranks of the rising against Turkey, by adding to the
other rayahs in revolt all the British creditors of the
Porte, who will now be just as eager to get rid of their
Turkish bonds as the Bosnians or Herzegovinese.
Vindication of Wales.
IN the course of his discourse on Crime before the
Social Science Congress at Brighton, LOKD ABKBDARE
mentioned that the crime of Wales, in proportion to the
population, is but half that of England. Ihis statement
may help to remove from some minds a prejudice they
have been imbued with in the nursery, that—
"TIFFY was a Welshman, TAFFY was a thief."
This slanderous nursery-rhyme should be cancelled, or
re-written, now that LORD ABERDARE has vindicated his
countrymen from the aspersion it implies. He has
demonstrated, by figures, that TAFFY is not half such a
thief as JOHN Bull-
Hunt to his Friend Punch.

A STRONG CASE FOE PLIMSOLI.
IF the report of BISHOP CLAUGHTON'S conduct in
the dismissal of the Head Master of Felstead Grammar
School be correct, his Lordship is clearly un-see-
worthy.
A SPEECH TO MEDICAL STUDENTS.
Aw exceptional " introductory lecture " was delivered on the first
instant, in the Medical School of the Westminster Hospital, by
MR. Ji it'ii AIM) DAVY. In marked contrast with discourses reported
the next day, and filling much space, it must have great.ly disap-
pointed many respectable persons who love to read, or sit and listen
to, a succession of moral and scientific platitudes. Ma. DAVY—
according to a summary of his address—began by saying candidly
that:—
"He disapproved in into of introductory addreues, but, at the requeit of
the Medical Council, conformed to custom. Both students and teachers pre-
ferred a day's pheasant (hooting to hearing or giving an ' introductory." As
a surgeon, he should cut down his sermon from an hour to fifteen minutes,
and his successor might still further reduce the volume of these fruitless
harangues."
MR. DAVT wronged himself in calling his lecture a "sermon."
It could have had no effect in common with morphia or mesmerism.
Still, in point of brevity, it was a model which preachers might
study.
Having touched on the subject of mfidioo-chirurgical reform, the
Lecturer next, in a few strokes, gave his audience a sketch of their
professional prospects. He told them what honours and payment
they mieht hope to obtain by the practice of their noble calling.
Thus did he set forth the generosity with which an appreciative
Government, and a grateful Public, are accustomed to requite the
services of medical men:—
"Their salaries were simply miserable; hospital physicians and surgeons
were, for the most part, unpaid. Poor Law Officers most piteously; surgeons
in the services very badly, and youn» practitioners not at all. For seven
years' hard work in the Marylebone Dispensary he had received one guinea,
and a very distinguished London assistant physician had found that his
salary equalled that of the man who put the skid on the omnibus wheels at
Holbora Hill."
Who, then, would enter the medical profession but a wealthy
philanthropist? We should say nobody except a poor fool. Perhaps
this consideration may, in a measure, account for the shortcomings
of medical science, as well as for the general quality of the intro-
ductory lectures delivered on the First of October. Possibly, in
some cases, for that of the whole course.
Ma. DAVT warmly supported a prophylactic Act of Parliament
denounced by sentimentalists. Moreover—
"Ho was pained at the nonsense which, had been let off over vivisection.
Practical experiment* were as important to medical men as to the Boyal
Artillery at Dartmoor."
In conclusion—
"He advised every one to resien at once any and every thought of becoming
a medical man unless be possessed three qualifications: —First, independence;
second, an aptitude and love for the profession; third, the readiness to pay .1
heavy premium in this world for his prospects of reward in the next."
It may be hoped that MR. DAVY'S introductory lecture will, if in
any sense a " sermon," at any rate not prove a "fruitless harangue."
The " lastly " of this " sermon " is commended to the attention of
all young men who dream of living by the practice of the medical
profession.
Longevity at Felstead.
DEAR MR. PITNCH,
I SEE in the Guardian that the Felstead Rump have adver-
tised for a new Head-Master. They promise him £200 a-year, and
"five pounds capitation fee for every boy beyond 25 and up to 75,
two pounds; for every boy beyond 75 and up to 150, and one pound
for every boy beyond 150." Will yon please to let me know, per
return, whether these are the common ages of boys in Essex, and if
the longevity of that county extends to girls P If so, I shall migrate
thither. Yours trnly,
AN OLD MAID.

Your Church has long been audible and visible,

THE NEXT NAVAL NOVEL.
CHAPTER XLV.—" The Lively Polly."
HE Vulcan wan
ploughing the s< a
bravely. In spite
of the immense
thickness of her
iron sides, she was
moving at a speed
of at least two knots
an hoar. It is
scarcely necessary
to explain to the
nautical reader that
she could have
attained even a
greater rate of
speed, had not the
Lords of the Ad-
miralty issued their
celebrated instruc-
tions regulating
the consumption of
coal.
"And so, MB.
SIMPLE SIMON," said our First Lieutenant (a Fellow of Trinity, by the way),
"our Junior Midshipman will join us at Portsmouth from Cambridge."
"Yes, Sir," I replied. "MB. MUTTONHEAB has done well. You will have
noticed, from reading the newspapers, that he joins us as Senior Wrangler."
"Yes, yes, very fair," commented my superior officer. "Still, I must con-
fess that I should have been greatly disappointed had he not joined us aa First
of his year."
"I suppose, Sir, he will resume his ordinary duties when he reports
himself?"
"Unite so. He will personally superintend the weighing out of the rations,
and will occasionally (in his official capacity) test the quality of the grog."
Our conversation was interrupted at this point by a cry from the sailor on
the look-out. The Second Lieutenant hurried on to the quarter-deck, and,
after the customary salute, addressed himself to his senior.
"Sir," said he, "it is my duty to inform you that black care often sits at
the back of the helmsman, and that, therefore, jn^t equitem sedet atra cura may
have a wider meaning than the glorious old Roman was inclined to give to it."
"Always classical, SOBJSKSIDES," remarked the First Lieutenant, with a
smile; "but I hope you bring no bad news. Remember garrula lingua nocet!"
"Well said!" exclaimed SOBERSIDES (who, I must admit, was something
of a sycophant). "But I wish merely to report to you that the look-out,
through his telescope, has made out a boat in the oiling. She appears to be
steering for us. How shall we get out of her way?"
"How far off is she?"
"Some five-and-twenty miles."
"We may yet have time to save ourselves!" exclaimed the First Lieutenant,
gallantly. "MB. SIMPLE SIMON, will you be good enough to get the Book of
Signals."
Of course, I complied with the request; and for the next three hours the
First Lieutenant, SOBERSIDES, and myself were engaged in perusing the
mysterious volume.
In the meanwhile, the boat discovered by the look-out continued on her
reckless course. She seemed to be a deserted pleasure yacht, of about two tons,
and, from the fact that she carried the name of Lively Polly painted in white
letters on her bows, I took it that she hailed from the Fort of Margate.
By degrees, she came nearer and nearer, until she was within half-a-mile
of us. Then there was a cry of astonishment from the lips of the younger of
our crew. She was carrying a sail—an article of nautical perambulation scarcely
known to the rising generation.
"Rara avis in terris nigroque timillima cygno," I heard one of our Second
Class boys observe to a companion.
"Tinrrw 1" replied the other, suiting the action to the word.
"Really, MB. SIMPLE SIMON," said our First Lieutenant, "I do not like to
disturb the Captain in the midst of his experiments, but I think I must trouble
you to request his presence on deck."
"Aye, aye, Sir,' I replied, and I descended below, and knocked at the door
of the laboratory of my Commanding Officer.
CHAPTEB XLVL— The Captain of the " Vulcan."
"COME in!" And I entered.
The Captain of the Vulcan was a thin, intellectual-looking student. He wore
long hair, and his eyes were shielded from the glare of a small fire (in which
several crucibles were glowing) by a pair of azure-coloured spectacles. His
laboratory, or (to use the nautical term " cabin") was furnished with a library
of dusty volumes, a stuffed alligator, and a few skeletons. He was standing
near a camera, and held in his hand a penny whistle.
"This interruption is very mal a propoi," he exclaimed as I entered.
"What is the matter, ME. SIMPLE SIMON?"
"We are in danger of a collision, Sir," I replied, respectfully.
"We are always in danger of a collision," he mur-
mured, petulantly. "Really, I must leave the matter in
the hands of the First Lieutenant. I have every con-
fidence in him."
I bowed, and was about to leave the apartment, when
an irresistible impulse seized me to put a question to my
Commanding Officer.
"Your pardon, Sir," I said with some hesitation,
"but the experiment upon which you are engaged seems
to interest you deeply. Is it indiscreet to ask you what
you are doing ? ".
"Not at all 1" he cried, with the enthusiasm of an
inventor. "I am attempting, with the aid of photo-
graphy, to fix and depict a ray of sound." _ And he blew
the penny whistle, and concealed his head in the curtains
of the camera.
On my return to the deck, I found that the Lively
Polly was *ithin a few yards of the Vulcan. We con-
sulted the Signal-Book for the last time, and prepared to
meet our fate like Officers, Gentlemen, and Scholars.
The crew of the Vulcan stood still, and closed their
eyes, and then came a shook. The-Zi're/f/ Polly's bow-
sprit had made a hole in the side of the Vulcan, and all
was lost!
At this moment the Captain appeared. He was calm
and resolute. He spoke to the First Lieutenant—
'What is the size of the leak?"
'Two inches bj; three, Sir."
'At what rate is the water coming in?"
'About a pint an hour, Sir."
'Then get to the boats, and save yourselves 1"
Within five hours of the collision, every man belong-
ing to the Vulcan had left that hapless ship to her
melancholy fate. And such is life on the waves!
CHAPTEK XLVII.-2%« Last of the " Vulcan."
IT was many years after the events related in the last
Chapter that I (now SIB PETEB SIMPLE SIMON) was
coasting in a steam-launch off the Isle of Thanet. On
board were my eldest son, his wife, and their youngest
daughter, a charming little maiden of nineteen. My
grandchild, who was called WOLFHILDA (a family name),
was standing near me, looking through a pair of opera-
glasses at some object seen dimly in the distance.
"0, Grandpa!" she cried, with a little joyous laugh,
"do let us see what it is! I am so curious!"
Willing to please her, I smilingly put the helm hard-
a-port, and we soon neared the suoject of our conversa-
tion. It turned out to be a very old ironclad, covered
with sea-weed. In the starboard side was a hole, which
had evidently grown larger, in the course of years, from
rust and the action of the waves.
"0 look, Grandpa!" cried WOLFHILDA, pointing to
the stern of the vessel. "See, the name is written
up!"
I put on my spectacles, and then leisurely looked at
the boards at which my descendant was pointing. Then
I uttered a cry of surprise.
It was the Vulcan tnat we had deserted five-and-forty
years before; and as we gazed upon the wreck, the brave
old ship at last began to sink.
Two months afterwards, the spot once occupied by the
Vulcan was occupied no longer!
Clerical Conference Question.
IN the course of a discussion, at the Oxford Diocesan
Conference, on the subject of Church Patronage, the
BISHOP OF OXFOB.D made a remark which may have
raised a question:—
"As to the appointment of Clergymen for terms of years, it
must be remembered that Governors of Colonies and others had
retiring peruiom, and a Clergyman without an incumbency
would be in a cold place as far M thi« world'• advantages were
concerned."
But, it may have been whispered among the Bishop's
diocesans, is not a cold place in this world preferable to
a warm berth in the other?
A King in a Fix.
WHAT ALFONSO, knave and cad-rid,
Can do, is a mystery hidden;
When his capital is Mad-rid,
And the race he rules mad-ridden.

<f
CAB, SIR.?"

:>NSII>KHI.VC. that we have ha(
a show of Caba, Cab-horses
and Cabmen, it seems to bi
only just to the employee
that we should have an ex-
hibition of the employers
Should the scheme come tc
anything, Mr. Punch wil
expect to hear that th
Cabmen of London liny
agreed upon the followin)
list of prizes.
First Prize.—Lieutenan
and Captain the HON. BBR-
TIE DASGLS (Life Guards
green). Ii in the habit o:
paying cabmen at the rate o:
two shilling! a mile. Has
a very small bump of lo-
cality. Considers the dis-
tance between the Guards
Club, Pall Mall, and the
Bank of England, Thread-
needle Street, to be seven
and a half miles. Forgeti
to dismiss his cabs, and
pays willingly and hand-
somely for keeping the
vehicles waiting.
Second Prize.—TAu., WALTER Cnffisus THOJCPKINS. Connected
with the City Money Market and South Belgravia. Although he is
a keen man of business, he payi his cabmen half-a-crown a mile,
because he wishes them to consider him a votary of fashion and the
"West End." When addressed as ;," My Lord," adds an extra
shilling to the fare.
Third Prize.—MAJOB Aw. PAT. Recognises a good horse when
he sees one before him. Pays only a shilling more than the legal
fare, but gives his cabman a cigar before parting. Never bullies the
driver when there is a mistake in the turning.
Fourth Prize.—Miss LILT HEABTSEASE. Pays nothing, but
makes her Mamma give an extra shilling when the weather is
showery. Says " Thank you!" when the door is closed for her.
Fifth Prize.— MH. .1 EKKMmr GKUHBLBTON. Growls on entering
the cab, and pokes his umbrella through the trap-door when any-
thing displeases him on the way, but who always pays double fare
at the journey's end.
Sixth Prize.—MESSES. BBOWN, JONES, and ROBINSON. Know the
fares, know the distances, and know that cabmen have to live, and
very often, moreover, have to support wives and children, and,
knowing all this, are not too hard upon poor fellows who are out all
hours of the day and night in all sorts of weather.
Grand Extra Prize.—For saying a good word for the Cabmen
(who, mind you, are not an ungrateful set!), Mr. Punch.
N.B.—Mr. Punch begs to say that h« will accept, in lieu of a
prize, future good conduct and civility.
THE BRITISH WORKWOMAN.
A Pcean of Modern Progreii, disrespectfully dedicated by Mr. Punch
to the Slack Country Niderings, ironically called British
Workmen!
"The women are >aid to take the place of father* a> well as of huabandi,
while the men are idle and drunken. . . . At Bromsgrove I heard also of the
growing custom of idle, lazy youag lad> looking out for skilled industrious
wires, in order to obtain an easy lit'*."—ilu. BREWER on tht Slack Country.
BBAVE Britons of Bromsgrqve 1 You 've hit on a plan
Which redounds to the praise of the creature called Man!
The term sounds archaic. It once, so 'tis said,
Stood for one who 'd a fancy for winning his bread
Before he devoured it, and held it foul scorn
To sponge on the sax which to motherhood'» born.
You have altered all that, and the heads of your houses,
Brave lads, are your stout Amazonian spouses.
You loaf, "train your whiffets," and razzl* and gorge,
While they sweat at the anvil and puddle and forge.
Ingenious scheme! Let us hope it may solve
Some of those puzzling problems which sages revolve.
Want work for our women? Absurd! while they 're able
To hammer a spike or weld links for a cable.
These swarthy she-Yulcans set fancy agog.
The old rule marital of knuckle and clog,
One would think, should be •waning, since women must work
At the toil their protectors are eager to shirk.
Brute-force in its bondage too long must have held her,
This " Oliver "-wielder and chain-cable welder,
Once known as Weak Woman! 'Tis pleasant to think
That the sex in the stithy can swelter and swink,
Whilst husbands and fathers,—these titles are nominal,—
Reserving their vigour for duties abdominal,
Grow fat on her toil, and their idleness cheer
With such light recreations as skittles and beer.
"Our Amazons?" Nay, 'tis not quite one's idea
Of a latter-day version of Penthesuea.
Those virile viragoes of old played the man,
As masters, not serfs; but the Black Country plan,
A happy contrivance, as cunning as brave,
Unsexes the Woman, but keeps ner a slave;
Shifts at last to her shoulders Man's share of the Curse,
Yet leaves him sole lord of her person and purse.
The British Workwoman! Up, pencil, and ply,
And bid her appear to the general eye!
No LELY or LA WHENCE is wanted to limn
That Daughter of Drudgery, grimy and grim.
A sight to raise dandified Chivalry's gorge.
For her skin is not sleek, and the reek ot the forge
Hides, not the cheek-roses the bardling be-sings,
But the pallor which ill-tended motherhood brings.
Yes, paint her, true limner, in hues of eclipse.
Toil's grime on her forehead, shame's seal on her lips,
Our Nymph of the Hammer, hard-worked and ill-paid,
The scapegoat of sloth, and the victim of Trade 1
Paint her so, and present her, the tribute of truth,
To the chivalrous souls of our stout British youth,
In the Black Country hives who the parasite play
Upon creatures, though loathly, less wormlike than they,
And contrive to lead easy and jovial lives
On the toil of their mothers, and sweethearts, and wives!
Hurrah! These magnanimous males may well cheer
For materialprogress, plus "tommy" and beer!
If the poor 'Woman's part in our grand Iron Age
Be the heaviest toil and the scantiest wage,
Give they not sweet assurance of family joys,
These she-smiths and their partners, the Black Country boys?
Where men drink, drowse, and dawdle, reserving their force
For that physical discipline, needful, of course,
When the bread-winner's restive. A chain-welding slave,
To coward marital and mercantile knave!—
Say, is there a creature more hopefully human,
Than this pride of our Progress, our Black Country woman P
ANOTHER GLORY GOING!
As if it were not enough that Temple Bar'should have given way,
another of the most venerable institutions of the City of London has
come to such grief as will necessitate its abolition, or at any rate its
iisuse. Witness the subjoined paragraph of melancholy news
touching Aldgate Pump : —
"AI.DOATE PUMP WATHK.—The Sanitary Record says it has had a sampls
of water from the Aldgate Pump analysed by MR. J. A. WANKLYN, whose
report shows that the water contains of solids 8; chlorine 11 1 ; ammonia,
'.tee, O'Ol; albuminoid 0'"6. It is, therefore, positively impure, contaminated,
and dangerous water."
Even if not absolutely removed from the site which it has occupied
almost from time immemorial, Aldgate Pump will remain where it
now stands only as it were a defunct carcase and a doleful monu-
ment. From the dignity of a hydraulic engine it will have sunk
into the abasement oi a supernumerary post. Aldgate Pump, if
permitted still to exist at all, will drag on a miserable existence,
livorced, so to speak, from the vitality it possessed as a fountain of
iving water, which, however, it perhaps really ceased to be, when
.he spring whence the neighbourhood derives water to drink
coming: to contain, among other',matters, "albuminoid" enough
almost to make that water " thick and slab.'' became converted into
truly dead well. Alas, poor old Aldgate Pump I

CARDINAL POINTS OF TACT.
IF" there IB sometimes wisdom in the wig, how ranch must there
always be in the Hat—the gift of an infallibly wise donor P
Although it is just possible that a Cardinal may err, who can point
ont any mistake in the eloquent discourse delivered by CABDINAL
MANNING on the twenty-fifth anniversary of that benefaction to
England by heretics misnamed Papal Aggression? Mark, for
instance, the extraordinary accuracy of the statement that:—
"The English Church, which remains established by law and endowed
with property, is so divided and subdivided by the internal conflicts of reli-
gious belief, that but the other day it was necessary to invoke an Act of
Parliament to determine their conflicts—nay more, to settle how Almighty
Ood is to be worshipped."
Now that we are told by CARDINAL MANNING, we see the full
scope of the Public Worship Act. Its framers no doubt thought
they had merely devised a statute to compel the observance of the
law which had long ago settled what public worship was to be, but
was only not strong enough to prevent the Ritualists from mimick-
ing Roman Catholic ritual. But the Legislature may learn from
CARDINAL MANNING that they meant not only to settle much more
than that in respect of worship, but also to determine conflicts of
religious belief—as though Parliament had pretended to be a synod.
Who dares to think that he knows better than what CARDINAL
MANNING says? Of course the Cardinal doesn't know better him-
self.
Here also is wisdom, in part perhaps prophetic, though our
MANNING disclaims the pretensions of our Cuvtti.su :—
"He did not pretend to be a prophet, but he ventured to foretell that if
ever England again clashed with the revelation of Divine Truth, she would
lose the last fragment of her Christian inheritance. But he did not think
England would, for Englishmen now knew that the Catholic Church had
nothing to do with politics, or with the Crown, except to obey it like good
subjects."
As long as the Ultramontanes, or as CARDINAL MANNING calls
them, the Catholic Church, do that, there is small chance that
England will ever clash with what he also calls the revelation of
Divine truth. Nor is there any fear that English Ultramontanes,
any more than Irish, will meddle with politics, or will do other-
wise than obey the Crown like good subjects, as long as the law
allows them the liberty they now enjoy, or any further liberty they
may claim. How loyally doubtless the Bishops would all behave in
Germany, if BISHARCK and his King would only desist from enforc-
ing education laws, which, being calculated to make the children
of German Catholics not only Catholics but Germans too, are there-
fore opposed to Papal policy!
Good Works.
"The Commissioners of Works intend to distribute, this autumn, among
the working classes and poor inhabitants of London the surplus bedding-out
plants in the Metropolitan parks."
YOUB bedding-out plants you may offer the poor,
Now Autumn her leafage is shedding;
But Winter will teach you they want something more,
And then you can oiler them—bedding.

TALK of Women wanting work! Here's a chance—from the

and industrious young Lady:—

Tlie Confession of a Voluntary Trappist.
AYIH& what is not
true, I know, is a
sin, or at least as a
baby I was taught
to think so; but I
find it difficult to
believe it, since
making the charm-
ing acquaintance of
so many ribbons of
Diplomacy, stars of
the two Houses, and
lesser lights of the
Legal and Medical
professions, who as-
sure me by their
daily practice of the
contrary; so that I
suppose it is only
some latent souvenir
of a Puritanical
code of morality
which makes me
shudder as I sit in
the back dining-
room in Stucco
Square, when I hear
that worthy but
dilapidated MRS.
SHRUB, with the chronic snuffle which peppermint and prevarica-
tion engenders, answer the knock at the front door with_a re-
sponsive— ->-.•-' "-^
"Hout of. Town, Sir. The fam'ly is at presink on the Riggy,
and don't return afore the hend of October." •
The " fam'ly" being myself and my two daughters.
When a widow in Society,—the best Society (well, not Marlborough
House, you know, andCarlton Gardens, but next door)—is expected
to be everywhere during the Season, from pigeon massacres at
Hurlingham to Son-slaughter on the Rink at PRINCE'S, it is difficult
on limited means to bring both ends to that affinity which a plump
banking account renders so easy: so when Society goes out of
Town we must go out of Town too.
•-••Accordingly, we go out of town, that is, we close the shutters,
send away our servants (who are engaged by the month, and, most
unaccountably, are found fault with just four weeks before the
Ministerial whitebait dinner), carefully dress all the furniture in
Tussore polonaises, call in the invaluable MRS. SHRUB, and retire
with our Murray* and Buedecken to the back dining-room, where
ETHEL and WINIFRED study the route we have chosen for our trip,
and study it till I am satisfied they can both pass a thorough
examination in it when we go down to my brother-in-law's in
November.
I had seriously thought of covering the small area of leads which
forms our landscape with cotton-wool or salt, which, with an old
Christmas-tree and a couple of alpenstocks, might have added to
the illusion: but as strict economy is the order of our vacation tour,
I have thought better of it, and simply put the refrigerator there,
which suggests ice, you know, though there is never any in it.
ETHEL practises the zither (the lessons are cheaper than a first-
rate pianofortist), and WINIFRED has set up the tails of a brace of
black game, as a souvenir of _the Tyrol, where we think of spending
a week as soon as the Righi has been sufficiently explored in the
pages of Bae decker and Murray.
My French and German, both learnt at Highgate some years ago,
are, happily, sufficiently polished to admit of teaching my dear girls
the necessary phrases which waiters and guides consider indispen-
sable; so that I feel sure that no tourist, and few foreigners, will
ever know that we have never left the back dining-room of 44, Stucco
Square, South Kensington.
"I wonder who it was that called 1" MRS. SMUUII suys. "Tim
gent wouldn't leave his name. But he come on foot, and 'ii'ginral
appearance wam't by no means haristocratio."
1'here are always a few men in town rushing through on their way
from Cowes to the Continent, or from the Grampians to Germany,
which makes it awkward sometimes, for my dear girls can never take
exercise until the evening.
After all, the parks are lovely when no one is in town, and I send
them sometimes down to Battersea, where they are sure to meet no
one of their acquaintance, and where they can get up some of the
plants Mi;uHA v will speak of so continually.
Lucky thought, to ask for GOUPFE'S Cookery at MUDIB'S. A
outlet, or chop is the most we indulge in; but it becomes quite
exciting to know what dish we shall have for lunch, as I never allow
my girls to mention the word chop, or cutlet without an addition, or
an alteration.
Chaudfroid d la Marfehale means cold outlets. Epigrammes a la
Montmorency, does not sound like chop and potatoes, but it gives an
additional zest to our somewhat monotonous meal, and, as we some-
times vary the entertainment by the substitution of mutton-broth,
it does not jar on our nerves when one hears it, in the dear ffirls
voices, dished up as Potage a la Reine Pomare, or Puree de Gibier
aux Quenelltt Imperiales.
The only luxury I allow ourselves is a cup of coffee. This we
take sitting on the leads outside, with the refrigerator as a table.
We make believe it's a cafi, and ETHEL pretends to be waiter, and
calls out " Pavilion d gauche-Bodm "—as to the manner born. We
have no neighbours but the cats—all the others being really absent
either in Switzerland, or Shepherd's Bush, at the Hague, or, perhaps,
only at Littlehampton.
The blacks are unpleasant, it is true, but we try to think they are
snow-flakes, and we wrap ourselves in our rugs and chorus the
Ranz des Vaches, certain that we shall be able to describe our
autumn tour as well as any of our friends we may meet this winter.
MYNHEER VAN DUNK.
(Anew Version.—AduswnSir Wilfrid Lawton.)
M v MI KM; VAN DUNK,
That he might not get drunk,
Drank milk and Thames water gaily,
After ridding the first
Of what it had worst,
By a LIPSCOMBE'S filter daily.
Singing, 0, that our London milk might be
As pore as it is in Alderney!
Milk mixed with water, as one to four,
No Londoner thinks of scorning;
But of milk unwatered he sees no more
Than the cow supplies,
Milked under his eyes,
In the Park on a summer's morning.
And his milk, like hia water, should filtered be,
And drunk, even then, most cautiously.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEL

BELLE A LA MECANIQUE. (A RINK WRINKLE.)
RAILWAY JOKES.
At Played Daily on the Principal Lines.
Tumrmp Sutiness into Pleasure.—Take a Traveller pressed for time, and induce him to
enter a train supposed to be in correspondence with another train belonging to another line,
and by which other train the Traveller proposes to proceed to his destination. As the first
train arrives at the junction, start oil' the second train en route for Town. The dismay of
the Traveller when he finds his journey interrupted will be, to say the least, most mirth-
moving.
The Panic-stricken Passengers.—Allow an express train to arrive at the station of a
rival Company two hours behind its time. The Travellers will, of course, be anxious to learn
the cause of the delay, and will (again of course) receive no sort of information on the
subject from the servants of the rival Company. Should there be any nervous Ladies in
the train, the fun will become fast and furious.
A Lark in the Dark.—Start a train ten minutes late, and gradually lose time until it
arrives in the middle of a long tunnel, and then stop the engine. Stay where you are for
half an hour, whistling and letting off steam every now and then, to increase the excitement.
Should it be known in the train that an express is due on the line of rails already occupied
by the carriages, the humour of the situation will be greatly improved. Before playing this
joke, it will be as well to lock the carriage-doors, and to carefully sever the cord of communi-
cation existing (on some lines) between the Passengers and the Guard.
A Comical Meal.—On a long journey promise that the train shall stop at a stated station
ten minutes for refreshments. Lose time in the customary manner, and allow the train to
arrive at the stated station half an hour late. Permit the Passengers to descend and to enter
the Refreshment-rooms. The moment they
are served, drive them back hurriedly into
the carriages with the threat that if they
are not immediately seated in their places
they will be left behind. When the
Passengers are once more in their com-
partments, the carriage-doors should be
securely locked, and the train can then
remain waiting beside the platform for
three-quarters of an hoar.
The Strange Companions.—Invite Ladies
and Gentlemen to travel in a First-Class
Carriage. When the compartment is a
third full, over-fill it with "merry" ex-
cursionists holding Third-Class tickets.
The contrast between the "merriment" of
the excursionists and the disgust of the
Ladies and Gentlemen will be found a
source of never-ending amusement.
A Wholesome Joke (added by Mr.
Punch and suggested to the Passengers).—
Whenever you find yourselves subjected to
the"fnn" of the Railway Officials, write
to the Newspapers and obtain a summons
against the Directors of the Company which
you believe to be in fault. Verb. sap.
PUNCH TO OCTOBER.
JOTOUS Month of the Pheasant!
Gamely come to the front:
Give us a time that's pleasant—
Menses tristes sunt.
Now and then a disaster
On the bright blue sea—
Royalty steaming faster
Than safe, where sails fly free:
Now and then a collision
'Twixt ships of monster power,
Bringing a sudden vision
Of battle's terrible hour.
Come, awaken, October 1
Give us a happier time:
England's oaken robur*
Should shake off folly and crime.
What can there be absurder
In a land of progress and pith,
Than every morning a murder
And every evening a myth?
0 for October weather
Oat on the moorland wide,
Birds in covert and heather,
Beauty at eventide!
If the Winter chills ns,
If the Spring is severe,
If a wet Summer fills us
With fancies utterly drear,
Yet our English Autumn _
Ought to have days divine:
Fair month, have you brought "em.
With game, and peaches, and wine P
Ministers turn one acid
With blunders worse than crimes:
0 for an Autumn placid—
And nothing new in the Times.
Come, russet, ripe October!
Month when England's ale,
Sipped by Judges sober,
Doth o'er all drinks prevail.'
Bring thy calmest weather,
Spare the yellowing leaves:
Punch, with his lengthened tether,
Over their downfall grieves.
Ay, and Youth at the portal
Of life will grieve much more
Than Mr. Punch, the immortal.

THE RUNAWAY COACH.
"Many a Layman has been somewhat startled of late by the pace at which
the Clerfry run away with the old Coach of the Establishment wheneyer it is
repaired."—Times.
A pronos of DISRAELI! How sad the reproach,
That he cannot pull up the runaway Coach,
That off the brisk team at a gallop will go,
The leaders too High and the wheelers too Low,
While the Whip who maintains he can best understand 'en,
Is driving the POPE and old HOMER in tandem!
BEN 's a judge of a horse too: indeed, there are few men
With eye that is keener, or truer apumen.
We remember his speech, when, with humour to flavour it,
He backed Angel to win, although Ape was first favourite.
But what can he do^-ask his warmest adorers—
When Rectors will jib, and when Bishops are roarers?
Away down the hill goes the runaway team;
The old woman who aits on the box doesn't scream;
For though the old coach has been many times patched,
Its early materials are not to be matched.
And the Coachman observes, with no atom of doubt,
"Only give them their heads, and they'll run themselves out!"
Punch must needs shake his head o'er this coaching revival:
And, whether 'tis BEN on the box or his rival,
Only hopes that the team (if they must have their kick),
Won't smash the old Coach by some rascally trick:
And whoe'er holds the reins, if the horses go wrong,
Let us wish him strong wrists, and a whip with a thong.
THE RULE OF HOME.
Aw " Inquiring City Clerk," fresh from his Roman History, writes
to ask if " S.P.a.R." stands for " Small profits, quick returns."
LADY HELPS.
ON this subject much nonsense has been written. They are quite
as suitable (perhaps more so than otherwise) to the cottage as to the
castle. The cottage need not have a name spelt with a Celtic series
of dissonant consonants. A few hints may be advisable to the
numerous." Lady Helps " at present in the market.
A Lady may efficiently help the mistress of the household to snub
her husband, by adroitly echoing (and improving) the said mistress's
remarks of a personal character.
A Lady may help the Cook to produce an original dinner, by
suggesting fresh combinations, which will make the said Cook
indignant, and even furious.
A Lady may help the Butler effectually, by decanting the '-15
port, and shaking it a little first, as you would DAFFY'S Elixir.
A Lady may help the visitors to the house by reading all the
letters that may chance to be thrown aside, and taking advantage of
any private intelligence they contain.
A Lady may help the master of the house by a flirtation in the
library, while the mistress is away on a round of visits.
A Lady may help the daughters to quiet talks in the Park with
ambitious Curates.
A Lady may possibly help the son and heir to—herself.
You see, there are ladies and ladies, as there arefugots et fagots,
and Mr. Punch has his suspicions of the Lady Helps of the future.
An Experienced Envoy.
A TELEGRAM from Berlin announces that:—
"The Arnim Case will come on before tho Supreme Tribunal on the 20th
of October."
By-and-by, perhaps, BISKARCK will discern COUNT AKNIM to be a
person possessing one important qualification at least for an office
of trust. He must see that he is a well-tried man.

PERSONAL INTELLIGENCE.
(From Our Own Special Eaveidropper.)
ORD SKYNFLYNT has invited a
small party of his friends to
stay a few days with him al
his mansion in Ayrshire. But,
as a rumour is abroad that Hia
Lordship's guests last autumn
were chiefly fed on rabbits,
there are reasons for supposing
that His Lordship's invitations
will this season be declined.
SIR THOMAS NODDY has ac-
cepted a seat on the directorate
of The Aldirate Pump and
Hounsditch Milk Adulterat-
ing; Company.
LADY PRATTLEWELL is suf-
fering from the loss of two oi
her front teeth, which she has
sent to be repaired by her
dentist, MR. TUGWELL.
The EARL OF STABBOROUQH has purchased the St. Giles's Theatre,
and there will shortly make his dfbut before a British audience, in a
burlesque, which has been expressly written for him by his wife.
The HONOURABLE MR. SCAMPERTON has just returned from a short
tour upon the Continent, wherein he visited Vienna, Copenhagen,
St. Petersburg and Moscow, returning by the way of Amsterdam,
Constantinople, Athens, Norway, Venice, Heligoland, and Rome.
LADY BOOBIE is at present on a visit at LORD OGLE WELL'S, near
Greenock, where she is enjoying some fair sport in her favourite
amusement of fishing—for compliments.
CAPTAIN SHARK is just now living with, and on, his friend LORD
LOOSEFISH, to whom he is imparting some, but not much, of his
knowledge in whist, billiards, and ecartf.
VISCOUNT NINCOMPOOP has laid a wager with LORD POPFINGTON
that he will shoot a score of sparrows, sing a comic song, swallow a
pint of shrimps, and swill a quart of soapsuds, standing on his head,
all within the space of sixteen minutes and six seconds.
MAJOR SLYHOOTS has returned from a campaign in Dumfriesshire,
where he has been laying siege to the widow of LORD MONIBAGGE.
MR. HOOKITT, after vainly trying to negotiate a loan upon some
Honduras and Ojibbeway Ship Railway State Securities, shot the
moon last quarter-day without taking out a gun licence, and since
has not been heard of, even by his Uncle.
LADY ROTJGELEY has contrived, after several attempts, to bring
LORD CRCTSUS on his knees (figuratively speaking, for his Lordship
has a wooden leg) before her eldest daughter.
MR. BORER has again been blackballed at the Snarlton Club,
although on this occasion he was both proposed and seconded by
Members of the Government.
The EARL OP MAGNOHBUHY is unfortunately laid tip with a sharp
attack of gout, in consequence of a week's visit to uis friend LORD
BEESWING.
MR. DUNDEH HEAD, M.P. for Muddleborough, took the chair, on
Monday last, at a meeting of the Anti-Vaccination and Small-Pox
Insurance Society.
MR. SNOBLEY has started in his yacht for Alexandria, with the
intention to waylay the Prince when he proceeds to India.
LADY BUTTERFLY has been fluttering about among her friends.
She is now on a flying visit to LORD CHRYSALIS, at Grubwell.
COLONEL LONGBOW is enjoying some rare sport in Central Africa.
According to his letters, which have not yet been credited, his
average bag per diem has consisted of six elephants, eight gorillas,
ten ostriches, twelve tigers, fifteen lions, twenty reindeer, and a
brace of hippopotami.
VISCOUNT LTOTORUP has proposed, and has been declined with
thanks by the HONOURABLE Miss BELINDA GOODIE GOODIE.
SILENCE IS BRAZEN.
0 WHERE is the BISHOP OF ROCHESTER?
On a jaunt beyond the seas?
And where, out of reach by goad or spur,
Are the Felstead School Trustees!
The GRTGNON affair—what an ugly tale !—
Could they not, if they chose, explain?
Do they let it pass by, like the idle gale,
As a slander they all disdain?
Again and again is the story told,
Which a word might at once confute;
But from pen, ink and paper their hands they hold,
'And their tongues keep also mute.
In the pride of a conscious rectitude,
Can it he they forbear reply?
Are they, Bishop and all, in too haught a mood
To a fiction to give the lie?
The world may believe that a Board of Trustees
Did an act of ungenerous spite,
Which a careless Bishop confirmed at his ease,—
Whereas both may be in the right.
They are silent still, they are silent all;
They are dumb while accusers shout.
They are deaf, as it were, to a trumpet-call—
Will nobody draw them out?
COTTONOPOLIS.
MR. ALDERMAN COTTON has expressed his intention of reviving
the glories of the Lord Mayor's Show on the 9th of next November.
On that day London is to be rejoiced with a glimpse of Trade
Deputations and Volunteer Detachments marching gaily from the

And double the Militia and the Line,

WHAT A SPLENDID CHEST YOU'D 'AV«, MB. BOWDBIB!"
"OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
Dated (en route) Oct. 11, Ilrantli/paunee, India.
SFR,—When the subject of H.R.H.'s visit to India was first on
the tapis (this is not an Indian word), the question you naturally,
yet artfully, asked, in my presence, was, "Who will to for us f"
There was no response. Silence may speak consent; and / (hitherto
Your Representative) was silent. So also was the rest of the party.
Enfin (again not an Indian word), to quote the Immortal Bard, the
rest waa silence. Then came the rumour that the Frinoe wouldn't
go. I knew that the Prince would go. I remembered the ancient
song, which said, " If I had a donkey wot wouldn't go,"—but we
had a Frinoe who had said he would go, and go he meant to, and
go he decided to, and gone he has 1
Going! going!! gone! 1!
But not there yet.
Now where's the fluster? Everywhere. Every newspaper
Editor rushine to me; my room besieged from dewy morn to foggy
eve. Editors, Proprietors, everywhere at my doors, at my windows,
all beseeching me and crying out, " You 're the man we want! Come
nut of your ambush! Name any terms you like! India and back
for five millions. Only do go."
"Gentlemen," I replied, seated at my rosewood desk, in my
damask dressing-gown with silk tassels, and the smoking-oap of her
work on my glossy locks, "Gentlemen, I cannot. I am another's.
My word is my bond—better than Turkish, more durable than
Khedives. The stance (not an Indian word) is dismissed."
They left, blowing their noses to conceal their emotion. It was a
touching sight. I put my pince-nez (French word, not Indian) to
my eyes, and took a sip of chocolate to conceal my emotion.
Then, Sir, I came to you.
In five minutes it was settled. I was to go as Your Representative
in India—as Agent in advance, to let yon know how the boilers of
the Serapis were getting on, and make things generally pleasant for
the Royal party.
Of course the Public will be fed from time to time with accounts
of.what is doing on board, and then will come "how gallantly, how
merrily," &o., we passed the day on the broad expanse of ocean.
You will hear how (also to be found in the song of The Admiral)
"strange things came up to look at us "—to take a sight at us—
"the monsters of the deep." Of all this you will be duly informed.
But where the interest must commence is in the Second Act of the
Drama, with the arrival of the Prince on Indian 8oil._ Till then,
the saucepan of journalism can only be kept simmering—then it

But this climax it is my aim to anticipate, that is, to a certain
extent. By the time you have printed and published this I shall
have arrived in India. I, Your Representative, will be on the spot,
rehearsing the Indian Rumjams, Rajahs, Burrumpooters (trouble-
some fellows these Burrumpooters—always have been), and my first
telegram, which you oan append to this letter, will put yon au
courant (French, not Indian, this—but I'm a master of both
languages, and have sincere friends in both countries) with my
doings, and will give the Public some sort of idea of what the Prince
will have to expect when he is welcomed here by the swarthy
natives.
You may depend upon me for genuine local colouring. Indian
ink shall not be spilt in vain by me. Of course this erudition and
labour can't be done for nothing, and Your Representative expects
something considerably extra for the local touches, Indian phrases,
&o., &o.
I have obtained introductions to the best society, and special
information on every subject from the intelligent REGENT' RILM.M UN,
now a resident in London—a worthy and noble Indian, who is
amassing a colossal fortune. He takes care of the pence, and lets
the pounds look after themselves. He is a Parsee-monious gentle-
man. [ Vide Foot-Note.]

11 A.M.—The Bungalows have arrived. They are as fine a get of

i.e., a genuine native Prince, all jewels and gold, daggers, swords,

instruction from Your Representative. We are arranging terms for

The Howdah rode in accompanied by a guard of Tiffins (mounted).
After kincob (an Indian meal for which there is no equivalent in
England), he treated me to a cigar and a review. To see the agility of
each Tiffin is marvellous 1 While his horse is at full gallop, the Tiffin
swings himself out of the saddle, rushes back three hundred yards,
fires his betel (a peculiar sort of Indian pistol), executes a supposed
enemy, and is on horseback again in less time than it has taken me
to recount the feat. I doubted, I said to the Howdah, whether this
Particular Tiffin would have had time to out off the head of a real
3e. It is dangerous to hint a doubt to a Howdah. He frowned,
and said something in Hindostanee, which I would rather not
translate. The result, however, was that an unfortunate Punkah
was ordered to represent the enemy, and, in the next charge, the
Tiffin (whose agility I had questioned) leapt from his horse, and,
before I could wink, his coolie flashed in the air, and the poor
Punkah rolled down-hill a lifeless corse at my feet! The Howdah
smiled . . . This telegram leaves while he is still smiling. Y. R.

THE CAT FOR CRUELTY.
LOBD ABEBDABE, in his speech on Crime, at Brighton the other
day, called in question the hitherto undoubted fact that the decrease
of robbery with violence was owing to the punishment of that
offence by flogging. From the tone of his Lordship's remarks, he
does not appear to enter into those feelings which are solaced by the
consideration that a cruel ruffian, by whom a person's teeth have
been knocked out, or his skull cracked, or his nose smashed on his
face, has been scourged to the effect of making him howl some time
for mercy. To this extent LORD ABEBDABE is evidently deficient in
the heart that can feel for another.
However, it is idle to argue the point whether or no flogging has
diminished garotting. If this were at all doubtful, it might be
tested by a very practicable and most desirable experiment. The
crime of wife-beating and wife-kicking is just now prevalent.
Extend the punishment of flogfring to savage assaults, and see
whether it does, or does not diminish them.
LOBD ABBBDABE should consider that for crimes of violence the
oat-of-nine-tails is not merely an instrument of retribution. It is
a means of commencing the moral education of the criminal by
teaching him what it is to feel physical pain, which he did not con-
sider when he inflicted it. The Cat appeals to his sensitive nerves,
in which resides all the feeling he has, and to arouse this is, neces-
sarily, the first step in a process of development tending, as highly
as possible in his case, to the elevation of our fellow-man.
THE HOUSE AND THE HOME;
OB, HINTS TOWARDS A GRAMMAR OF DECORATIVE ART.
By LEONABDO DELIA ROBBIA. DB TTJDOB WESTPOND TTJMPKTNS,
ESQ., S.A.8., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the Dulli-
dillitanty Society.
Paperhangingi.—The most important feature in this portion of
decorative art is "The Dado."
Origin of the Dado.—It is supposed originally to have been the
feminine of the now extinct Dodo. The Dodo and the Dado were
formerly, of course a very long time ago, caught, stuffed, and kept
in glass cases in the Atrium or Hall of the House. In order to dis-
play the plumage, the wall forming the back-ground to the Dado,
ana visible through the glass, was coloured plainly in paper, or if
the bird had not been in good health, in "distemper "—but, as the
Latins said, Dittempera mutantur. and as we haven't now got the
Dado, and are forced to do without her, so we perpetuate the
remembrance of her stuffed existence by colouring the wall of the
hall to a height of three or four feet from the floor. Whatever
colour you choose, bear what I have told you in mind, and don't
forget the Dado.
Flock patterns are, as might be supposed, a sheepish sort of
design, and I cannot recommend them.
For the pavement of a hall—and by a hall I mean something
more than a narrow passage between the front door and the dining-
room, lighted by an outside gas lamp—tiles should be used.
How to Collect Tiles.—Give several parties. At each party
several guests will do what Bo-Peep's sheep did with their tails—
and leave their "tiles" behind them. These tiles can be easily
arranged for the hall.
As for pattern in tiles, buy a kaleidoscope. It will supply you
with an endless variety of patterns.
But if you require REAL NOVELTY, take my advice, and combine
the useful and amusing with the ornamental. Make your hall a
place where to spend, nappily, a rainy day. Every householder
should make provision against a rainy day—and here you are;
here is your modui operandi: Lay down a chess-board pattern in

tiles. Have chess-men made as big as skittles. Yon oan then walk
about and play the game*
The same pattern forming a chess-board will also do, of course,
for draughts. But, as draughts should always be avoided in a
house, specially in a hall, I will not be the first to introduce them.
A skittle alley, and an alley for American bowls, should form part
of every well-regulated hall.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
While so near the front door, it will be as well to pay some atten-
tion to the exterior decoration in knockers and bell handles.
The knocker, which might be a Roman note, or a fist, should be
so arranged as to answer tit own requirement!.
I will explain. When a person knocks at a door, it means that
he wants tomethiny. Now, the first thing he wishes to know is.
whether any one is at home. Now, the knocker may be so arranged
as to touch a spring, with one knock, which shall immediately shoot
out a white metal plate with "Not at Home" on it. Two raps
would produce "Return Uncertain." Three raps, which would
show obstinacy, and would indicate an unfriendly spirit on the part
of the rapper,—an unfriendly spirit-rapper,—should produce a
metal plate bearing the words "Be Off.'" Four raps, evincing
pertinacity, animosity, or clearly the hand of a dun, should produce
a plate with the words " Go to—Jericho!" on it. All this can be
managed with a circular shield, of medieval design, affixed to the
front door at a small cost.*
A fifth rap should touch a percussion exploder, and project a
small but sharp-hitting pea, with the words "Do 'a done! will


you f "—or, instead of the percussion, a piston-worked squirt which
would discharge a small quantity of water into the rapper's face.
Bells could be arranged on a similar principle. Unless they were
entirely done away with, and speaking-tubes used.
The Master or Mistress is then able to go to the window, or with-
out doing so to recognise the voice of the caller. In which case, if
there is a piano at hand, DB. WATTS'S Sluggard's Hymn can be
adapted and sung as follows:—
'Tis the voice of the Caller,
I heard him complain,
"Not at home 1 Always out I
I won't call here again."
Or, without wasting time in'song, the answer can be at once given,
"No, gone out," or "Not at home," or
yon can call down through another
tube to the footman in the pantry, and
?ay, "Master's not at home—gone
out—won't be back for ever so long,"
&c., Ac.
Thete Tubet can be, externally, in
floriated metal of exquisite, design,
representing flowers of speech.
These speaking-tubes save the ser-
vants' legs, if that is an object, and
your servants' legs should be an object
—of admiration.
A propos of "saving your servants'
legs "—every Lady of fashion should
have a cupboard where she should save
her servants' legs—I mean a cupboard
which should represent a Domestic
Magatint, for the me of male ser-
; vants, and be filled up with plenty of
padding.
A Lawyer, a Doctor, a Clergyman,
a Dentist, an Artist, an Author, an
Actor, &o., 4c., each one ought to
have a special and peculiar style of
furnishing his house, instead of bringing down the decorative art to
one dead level uniformity.
* Send to the Author of this work; h» knows tho man to do this cheap.
Small commission; no oth«r charge. Orders punctu ally attended to.

SfFor example, a Barrister's door knocker should be a tail of a legal
wig; a Clergyman could publish his bands outside; a Dantist could
have a tooth and nail, and so forth.

(To be continued.)
(POLICE)-COUET THEATRES.
IT is stated, on the best authority that can be found for the
rumour, that the delay which has taken place in providing proper
Police Courts in several districts where the existing ones are dis-
gracefully inadequate, has been occasioned by the consideration of a
scheme which would necessitate buildings of an entirely different
character. It has been thought that the large amount of " ap-
plause," "laughter," and " cheers, which were taken up outside
the Court." continually occurring, might warrant the establishment
of an auditorium where such manifestations would appear less out
of place. The ordinary design for a bijou theatre would be all that
could be desired.
In this the worthy Magistrate might occupy the centre of the stage,
and persons of distinction, instead of being " accommodated with a
seat on the Bench," could be shown into a private box. The Chief
Clerk might be accommodated in a prompter's box, such as is used at
the Opera House, where his various suggestions and expoundings of
the law would not appear so derogatory to the Magisterial capacity
as is occasionally the case at present.
Prisoners, accompanied by a Policeman, might come np a trap
from the cells. On conviction, they might descend amidst flashes of
red fire. On acquittal, they might be allowed to bow to the audience
and retire at the wings, amid applause. Any defendant informed
that he. or she, left the Court "without a stain on his (or her) cha-
racter, might at his, or her, exit, have the limelight turned on,
as a visible and sensational symbol of innocence triumphant 1
On such a stage the worthy Magistrates and Counsel, who are now
so often witty under every disadvantage, might crack their jokes
to their hearts' content, and receive naturally the national tribute
of laughter and applause.
On these boards the Comic Witness might "gag" till he brought
down the house; while the Comic Prisoner might rouse " the Gods"
to that enthusiasm which expresses itself in the cheering which at
present is so often "taken up outside the Court."
The question of refreshment-rooms, and a small orchestra to play
appropriate airs during the unavoidable pauses in the proceedings,
such as adjournments for lunch, might be considered at leisure.
While, however, "laughter," "applause," and "cheers," cannot be
suppressed in the Courts that exist, Police-Court Theatres do not
strike us as a very great innovation. If Justice cannot be ad-
ministered with gravity, in the present temper of the public, we see
no reason why the temples of Themis should not be invested with
all the attractiveness that now belongs to those of her popular rela-
tives Melpomene and Thalia.
What Can It Be P or, the Sphinx of the Sea.
THE Correspondent of the New York World, on board the
Pandora, hailing from Disco, transmits his log; wherein occur the
following entries:—
"Monday Wlh.—Begins with calm. At three A.M., DAVIES, A.B., catches
three'moley-mokes.' At eleven we see two seals. . . . We also §ee several
bottle-nosed whales."
A bottle-nosed whale may be imagined a S6a,-Bardolph, an
emblem of a man who drinks like a fish, as a whale drinks, it either
a fish or a whale drinks at all. But what is a "moley-moke"?
There are said to be sea-horses. Can the " moley-moke" be a sea-
donkey i We hope the People will shortly be enabled to study a
"moley-moke " in the Westminster Aquarium, some fine Sunday.

EQUALITY.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere. "CAN YOTT TELL MB, JANB, WHAT YOU MOST WANT FOR YOITR
Jaw. "RKALLY, MY LADY, I CAN'T 'ABDLY BAY. I 'AVKN'T GOT NOTHING. BUT YOU'D KNOW BEST, MY LADY—ANYTHING JUST
WHAT i OU'D WANT, MY LADY, IF YOU WAS IN THB SAUK POSITION."
A WONDERFUL SHOW.
ENGLAND is a showf ul country. But we question whether any qf
the Shows and Exhibitions which have allured millions of shillings
during the last quarter of a century can vie, for variety and com-
prehensiveness, with one which is being held this week at the
Alexandra Palace.
The mere recital of the extraordinary attractions now on view at
the Alexandra must convince the most hardened sight-seer that
there is still something left to stimulate his attention, and satisfy
his curiosity.
Pouters.—We put these first, because of the place they occupy in
the advertisement. But why they should hold such a prominent
position, or why they should be thought to possess any merit at all,
we are at a loss to understand. Pouters ( one who pouts," Diet.)
may be found in most domestic circles, particularly where there are
children, but this must be the first time that the idea of rewarding
them with prizes can have entered into anyone's head.
Carriers.—A most useful class, who deserve all the encouragement
that can be parcelled out to them. The success of the Cabmen's
Show has, no doubt, suggested the propriety of awards to Carriers.
Dragons.—This class ought of itself to fill the Palace to over-
flowing, and to bring in a fabulous amount of money. There is not
a Zoological Garden in the world which can boast of even a single
specimen. Having the repute of being very ferocious creatures, we
trust all proper precautions will be taken to ensure the public
safety.
Tumblers.—No rarity either at the Alexandra or Crystal Palace.
Perhaps these may possess some extraordinary elasticity of limb,
some singular strength of nerve, calling for special commendation.
Jiarbs.—Out of place here. Ought to have been sent to the Horse
Show.
Jactibins.—Very interesting. Ilather a surprise to find they are
not extinct, at least under this name. See CAXLILE'S History oj the
French Rtoohttion. Not to be confounded with Jacobites, of whom
there are no specimens in the Collection.
Fantaih.—A complete puzzle. The hats of peculiar shape, worn
by coalheavers, dustmen, and other industrious classes, are, we
believe, called "Fantails;" but such articles scarcely seem inte-
resting enough for public exhibition.
Nuns.—None so remarkable as these in the whole Show. All our
conventional notions of the seclusion and retirement of these excel-
lent persons are shattered to pieces for ever. It is needless to add
that they are without exception carefully hooded. (We looked in
vain for prize Monks to match them.)
Trumpeters.—Novel, but noisy. Probably supplied by the bands
of Her Majesty's Regiments. Perhaps more suitable for a National
Music Competition.
Oah, Magpies,—Attractive to bird-fanciers, Judges, and chat-
terers.
Runts— Can this, after all, be a Cattle Show?
Turbits. —Is this a misprint for Turbots?
Antwerp!.—For mysteriousness may be bracketed with Fantails
and Nuns. There is but one Antwerp in the world, and to transport
it from the Scheldt to Muswell Hill, even with all the appliances of
modern scientific ingenuity, is simply an impossibility.
Archangels.—This Show must be a hoax. Nothing of the sort I
It is really a Pigeon Show. Poultry also; but these we must entrust
to other pena.
Useful Knowledge in Yorkshire.
HOOHAT for the Yorkshire Training Schools for Cookery!—esta-
blished by the Yorkshire Ladies' Council of Education in various
Yorkshire towns, particularly York, Leeds, and Wakefield, to teaoh
Cookery in all its branches, from those at the top of the tree down-
wards, and so instruct the poorer classes how to better and cheapen
their meals; which perhaps may be said to be going to the root of
the matter. It is confidently anticipated that the effect of these
Yorkshire Training Schools will even extend to a very considerable
improvement of Yorkshire Pie. Let them take care: "Le mieux
est Pennemi du bien."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHEERS FOR THE "CASTALIA."

MB. PUNCH, feeling the deepest interest in the success of the
Castalia (a most admirable vessel), has great pleasure in publishing
the following letters which have reached his office during the last
few days. To judge from their contents, some of them seem to have
been written by the Correspondents who have been airing the sub-
ject recently in the columns of a highly respectable and respected
contemporary:—
SIR, October Uth, 1875.
WILL you allow me space in your excellent pages to supple-
ment with a few words of popular explanation the valuable observa-
tions of the wants who have treated the question of sea-sickness
from a scientific point of view? I think the following simple
illustration .will be as easily understood by the most frivolous as by
the least learned.
Suppose a smooth sphere to rest on an inclined plane at an angle
of—say forty-five degress. To fix our ideas, we will imagine that
the plane weighs a pound, and that the smooth sphere is of globular
form and is vertical in direction. When the smooth sphere is at
rest, we will imagine that the lateral gravity is virtually impressed
with a weight varying from zero to double (or even more) the weight
of the intermediate velocity between the initial reaction and the
artificial upward motion. Assuming this to be the case, it stands to
reason that if the brain is removed (with becoming gravity) from
the lowest point to the place where the upward motion W9uld
increase the pressure between the smooth sphere and the inclined
plane, the difference between the brain and the table (upon which it
now would rest) must be equal to a reversed pressure of two pounds,
or, in other words, a ratio of lateral velocity exactly corresponding
with what gravity would confer upon it from the rest. Now, of
course, it is for pathologists to say whether this variable gravity
acting en the stomach will or will not produce nausea; bat if it icill,
why then sea-sickness is at once accounted for.
Adding my declaration to the mass of evidence already collected
testifying to the excellent sea-going qualities of the Castalia,
I have the honour to remain, Sir,
Your humble, obedient servant,
The Lexicon, Leamington. PLAIN ENGLISH.
SIB, October WJi, 1875.
I THINK there can be no doubt now ab9ut the success of the
Castalia. She has only to be well known to gain a large and lasting
popularity.
Faster engines have been suggested as a mode for securing this
very desirable publicity, but I think I can propose a far better plan.
In years gone by, there was (I am given to understand) a coach
running between London and the Provinces, which was wont to
carry its passengers for nothing. This plan was adopted to ruin the
prospects of a nval conveyance. Now, Sir could not the Directors
of the Castalia take the hint, and convey their travellers at a similar
rate? The scheme might be greatly improved upon by the addition
of a gratuitous dinner offered to the passengers before starting.
If the latter valuable suggestion is adopted, I, for one, shall be
very happy indeed to patronise the Castalia daily for weeks and
months — nay, perhaps, even for years to come.

Sra, October 16th, 1875.
THE Castalia is unquestionably an excellent vessel—per-
haps a little too excellent. I am a first-rate tailor. I have been
all over the world, and have never been ill in my life. My wife, on
the contrary, is invariably reduced to silence the moment we leave
the harbour. The other day, to my great annoyance, she insisted
upon travelling in the Castalia. I opposed the plan, because I have
been accustomed to enjoy peace and a cigar on the deck of the Mail
Boat when my wife has been helpless in the cabin below. How-
ever, she would go by the Twin ship, and, thanks to the disgusting
steadiness of the vessel, on this occasion I enjoyed neither peace nor
a cigar. My wife remained on the deck the whole time, and
favoured me with her views (very decided ones) — anent latch-keys
and late suppers.

SIR,
MABBTED FOR MONEY.
October 16th, 1875.
As a very old sailor, who has made the passage between
Dover and Calais at least a score of times, I trust you will permit
me to say a few words about that greatest of modern inventions, the
twin-ship Castalia.
In the olden days, I have seen the Mail Boat crowded with pale
men and suffering women. The miserable hour and a half has
been miserable indeed, especially at times when the weather has
been described (excuse my nautical phraseology) as "dusty.
A few days since, I determined to cross the Channel in the Castalia.
The sea was tolerably calm, and the sky was beautiful. As a
thorough salt, I made my customary preparations to secure a
painless passage. Before starting, I consumed a hearty lunch of
salt herrings, boiled mutton, lobster, champagne, and Chartreuse
vert. My pockets were full of rose cough lozenges and liquorice,
and next to my back I carried a good sized linen bag, containing
crushed ice, mustard seed, and powdered camphor.
Thus fortified, I went on board, and took up a position near the
centre of the vessel. I lighted a cigar, and enjoyed, for the first
time, a splendid view of Dover Castle. The Castalia began to move,
and we slowly left the harbour. The moment we were in the open
sea, I noticed a slight (a very slight) rolling— as comforting as the
rock of a cradle. I took out my note-book to chronicle further
observations, when, I am sorry to say, I was suddenly seized by a
strange indisposition, which caused me to lie on my back for the
rest of the journey.
The Steward (who was most attentive to me) informed me on our
arrival that only one passenger had been ill during the passage.
I am, Sir, your obedient servant,
The Sea Gulls, Slackheath, AN ADMIREE OF NELSON.
DEAR MASTER, October 16th, 1875.
IN compliance with your honoured instructions, I have just
been from Dover to Calais and back in the Castalia. The sea was
rough, but the movement of the vessel was so pleasant that we, none
of us, felt in the least unwell. The ship (when she has new engines)
will be a great success in every particular.
I hope you will not be angry with me for biting a man who said
something about my " bark being on the sea." 1 could not help it.
He told a story — I did not bark at all.
Yours respectfully and affectionately,
On Board the " Castalia," Dover. TOBY.
Does a Bad Ending make a Good Beginning P
IF so, there is much hope for the new Servian Ministry, which, as
we learn from the Daily News of the llth instant., contains the
following names: M. KAUEVIC, M. PAVLOVIC, MAJOK SDRAVKOVIC,
COLONEL PICKOVIC, and M. JANCOVIC. COLONEL PICKOVIC is probably
a member of an Eastern branch of the PICKWICK family; but, be
this as it may, one cannot but regret the appointment of so vicked a
Ministry at such a critical moment.
To the Serapis.
"The boilers (of the Serapis) have been found to prime to an
extraordinary degree."
YOUR boilers are " priming," and just at a time,
When, consid'ring your errand, they ought to be prime.

SCHOOLS FOR SCAELET FEVER.
IT is possible for School Board visitors to be not a little too active
in the execution of their office. Some of them exceed it by the
exercise of considerably too much zeal. Witness a case related by
"A MEDICAL MAN" m the Standard, "a propos of compulsory
school attendance." The children of a family he usually attends
have lately been suffering from severe, if not malignant, scarlet
fever. During its continuance, they having: been removed from the
Board School which they had previously been attending, remained
some time absent, when—
"The visitor called on the mother during the week to learn the cause of
their absence, of which he was informed. 'How long had they heen ill?'
'Some ten days; one was then very bad.' 'One was nearly well?' 'Yes —
at least, was much, better/ 'She must be sent to school again imme-
diately.' The mother replied that she did not think it would be riifht to send
her, oa she would probaoly convey the infection to the other children in the
school; and, upon the visitor insisting, positively refused to allow the child
to attend for the present. The viiitor, finding her determined, left, threaten-
ing to take further proceedingi."
Zeal, in the conduct of this official, appears to have dangerously
prevailed over discretion. In fact, the latter attribute may be
thought so conspicuous by its absence as to constitute an utter
nnfitness for any function which could not be performed by a fool.
According to " A MEDICAL MAS," however, such fools as this one
are by no means uncommon amongst School-Board visitors : —
"Yet it is a matter of wonder why scarlatina, &c., have lately been so
much on the increase. Often I hare been horrified, on 'calling to see children
barely convalescent from scarlet and other fever*, to hear that they were at
school; and, on inquiring what could hare prompted the mother to tend
them, have been informed that the School-Board rUitor had been and had
insisted on their resuming attendance at once."
Not to know that "scarlet fever is a deadly and most infections
disease," that for at least a month after ita disappearance it is not
safe for a child to return to school, and that the case is the same
with measles, chicken-pox, hooping-cough, and typhus, is ignorance
through which "A MEDICAL MAN," has found all those diseases, and
perhaps even small-pox also, propagated by "hyper-zealous visi-
tors " of Board-Schools. Is not such ignorance on the part of such
officers quite as criminal as any which, when it kills people, juries
tind to be manslaughter?

PROVINCIAL MOSSOOS IN THEIR SUNDAY BEST.
THE PRINCE'S LAST WORDS.
Oct. 12, Dover Pier.
Lo, the Cattalia ready to start,
And our pet Princess, with a tremulous
heart,
Thinking of perils by sea and shore—
When there comes a Mayor (don't call him
a bore!),
And, to tha Mayor a natural pendent,
A Corporation, in robes resplendent,
And the sauve Lord Warden, with patience
Says, "Vour Royal Highness, this is the
Mayor."
He had an address, which he could not
read,
For the Captain wanted to get up speed:
The moon was bright and the sea was calm,
And why should Royalty suffer a qualm?
There was tug and turmoil the deck all over,
So " nnabatedly loyal" Dover
Was perforce content with a word in the
Times,
And immortal fame in Punch't rhymes.
Never, since Princes had to be fluent,
Was better speech than our royal truant
Made to the mighty Mayor of Dover—
Who wished him fortunate passage over,—
For he simply said, with his good-humoured
air,
"I am much obliged to you, Mr. Mayor."
The Prince's laconic style of reply
We advise all mayor-ridden magnates to
try. ==========
"With a Difference."
"I sir at ten pounds a week," exclaimed
Sir John Falstaff; and the fat knight
wished to make an end of it. "I sit at
ten pounds a day" might be the exclama-
tion of the Chief Commissioner at an
Election Inquiry, "and I have not the
slightest desire to make an end of it."
Verb. Sap.
REASSURING INTELLIGENCE.
A LOAD must have been taken from many minds by the Times'
statement that the Pump in Aldgate, about to ba closed by the
City Commissioners of Sewers, "on account of sewage contamina-
tion rendering it absolutely unfit for domestic purposes," is another
Pump than the venerated engine which has stood so long the
ornament and glory of Aldgate, and bears, distinctively, the name
of that famous Ward :—
"The offending pump is opposite the Church of St. Botolph, Aldgate, at
the corner of the Minories, and must not ba confounded with the Aldgate
pump par excellence, situated at the junction of Leadenhall and Fenchurch
Streets, against which no imputation can justly be made."
Let us hope so. Perhaps Aldgate's own Pump descends into a
formation below the stratum whence sewage leaks into the well
of the mere Pomp in Aldgate. Maybe the water of Aldgate Pump
par excellence excels that of the other in purity, and, particularly,
does not contain any of that meaty "albuminoid," which, present
as so much, and in any quantity too much, "body," in any water,
renders it peculiarly unfit to drink. Alas, this possibility is con-
tested as a fact, but if it were really so, and not otherwise, what
good citizen would not rejoice exceedingly to learn that the announce-
ment of conditions implying an end to Aldgate Pump was a false
alarm?
NICE NAMES FOR THE NAVF.
ALABIOSTS we are not, and have no wish to frighten anybody.
Still, we cannot help remarking that there really is some room for
some improvement in our Navy. Costly as they are, our ships seem
hardly worth the pains and pounds we spend on them. Soon as
they stir from shore, they appear to be assured of either breaking
down, or else of breaking up and sinking. The Vanguard was lost
lately, mainly owing to bad seamanship; and the Serapis, though
chosen for her speed as the right ship for the Prince, has, !it is
reported, owing to the "priming" of her engines, been (teaming at
the rate of only seven knots an hour!
In either men or ships, then, it is clear we cannot boast much of
our Navy just at present. Put not your trust in Ironclads, must
just now be the watchword. As a cautionary measure, it might be
wise to change the names of certain of our ships, so as "to inspire a
wholesome doubt of their seaworthiness. Names expressive of dis-
trust might be judiciously applied, and might by way of warning
prove of service to the nation. Instead of choosing names such as
the Victory or the Valorous, it might be well to christen vessels as
the Faulty or the Timorous. As a name of evil omen we should
rather like to see a big ship launched as the Cassandra. Names
such as the Trusty we would utterly discard, and in their place
make use of others—such, for example, as the faithless, the Decep-
tive, or, still worse; the Unreliable. The Eagle or the Lynx might
likewise well be laid aside: and to imply a bad look-out, we would
call a ship the Mole, the Bat, or else the Blindworm. For the
Camilla or the Swiftsure, we would advise the substitution of the
Sinksure or the Slowcoach: while in lieu of braggart titles like the
Terrible, the Bulldog, the Ajax, and the Thunderer, we would
recommend the usage of a more modest nomenclature—as, for
instance, the Feeble, the Tortoise, the Jackass, or the Blunderer.
Herzegovina and Spain.
A PARTr in Spain is said to meditate a pronunciamento in. favour
of Ex-QuEKN ISABELLA. While they are about it, they might as
well tell us how to pronounce the name of the Herzegovinian Leader
LJUBEBRATICS. That crack-jaw word looks about as like
"Lucubrations" as "Skuptschina" to " Soup-kitchen."

OUR ADVERTISING COLUMN.
HAVE we Cannibals among us, without going to the Fans of the

advertised in the Daily Telegraph:—

Apply, &c.
Pecksniff is immortal. Therefore we may be sure Pecksniff can-
not be dead. He lives and advertises. Here surely we trace the
fine Pecksniffian hand, in this advertisement from a recent number
of a leading daily :—
GOOD NEWS FOE FATHERS.—An architect, of credit and renown,
has VACANCY for ARTICLED PUPIL, on exceptionally favourable
terms ai regards premium and advantages.—Letter to PALLADIA, o, Stucco
Terrace, South Kensington.
Othelh talks of "anthropophagi and men whose heads do grow
beneath their shoulders." Had the Moor been a reader of the daily
papers of October, 1875, he miftht have felt that the advertisement
which heads our column of Wants was meant for his " anthropo-
phagi." And surely he would have admitted that the "delicate
monster" demanded in the advertisement to which we now give
extended publicity, would have been worthy to figure beside his
men with heads beneath their shoulders :—
10 PLUMBERS, GASF1TTERS, Ac. — WANTED, a THREE-
- HANDED MAN.—Apply, &c.
Can anybody tell us why Plumbers and Gasfitters should be con-
sidered the likeliest trades to supply such a phenomenon?
Widowers beware !" Lady Helps" are all the cry; and here is
a Lady, who evidently, we should say, means to help herself. As
an appeal to the Snobocracy, her last touch is capitally imagined.
This serene Lady Housekeeper will have nothing to say to parvenus
or noui-eaux riches: so, if she accepts a situation, her happy hirer
may feel assured that he does not belong to either of these " low"
categories. Such a Housekeeper will, of herself, bo as good if not
as a patent of nobility, at least as a cachet of distinction:—

lent manager, calculated to make a home very comfortable. Being a staunch
Churchwoman (without bigotry), a thorough Lady both by birth, position,
and education, she could not treat with any one avowedly professing 110 reli-
gion, neither with parvemu nor nouvcaux riches,—Address, &o.
We can only end as we began—Widowers beware!
And here's a chance for the Clerk of the Weather in London, if—
as we admit is very unlikely—he should be short of the article ill
question for November :—
1HIRTEEN ACRES OF FOG TO LET.
We cut this advertisement from the Leeds Mercury. Leeds is a
good way from London, but no doubt, as fogs can be let by the acre,
they are capable of being carried by the mile.
SHAKSPEAAE has familiarised us with the notion of " Sermons in
stones." What do our readers think of " Sermons on bones?' This
happy thought seems to have occurred to the Ex-Indian Chaplain
whose advertisement we take from the Ecclesiastical Gazette:—
PREFERMENT or EMPLOYMENT SOUGHT, lor a period not
Ji. exceeding Two Years by au Indian Chaplain on furlough. Age fifty-
five. Thirty years in Holy Orders. Opposed to all mimicry of Woman
usages. Preaches Extempore from a skeleton. Ample testimonials. London,

DESPOTIC OFFICIAL!
Punch wants to know
Why in the world you drench us so;
Why, with savage persistence, again and again,
You turn off the sun and turn on the rain;
Why you spoil the frills of the lovely sex:
Why Thames and Severn and Trent and Exe
Of their legal limits pass the line,
And in neighbouring cellars spoil the wine.
The official mind, 0 Clerk of the Weather,
Is apt to keep to a certain tether:
The Board of Admirals clearly think
'Tis nothing to them if Ironclads sink:
The POSTMASTEH-GENEBAI, scorns all fetter,
And laughs at the fellow who loses a letter;
If on Home Affairs a man 's at a loss,
Little he '11 get from ASSHETON CROSS.
But on Olympus, 0 Weather-Cleric
(Punch respects you as heing Homeric),
There are surely officials who manage to beat
The do-nothing duffers of Downing Street:
And now, as the rains are washing away
The splendour of Autumn's divine decay,
Punch, Earth's Zeus, insists on knowing
Who left the tap of the cistern flowing.
It really will not do, you know,
This damp, discouraging overflow:
Clerk of the Weather, think again
Defore you order additional ram.
Would you cruelly make your Punch rheumatic,
And drown the only wit that's Attic?
If you turn to a sponge our native granite,
We must emigrate to another planet.
Insolvent Islam.
THE Mahometans were, during the ages of Chivalry,
stigmatised by Christian knights with the name of
"Pay mm." This appellation revived, with the dif-
ference of a letter, will perhaps very soon be rendered
applicable to the modern Turks. There is too much
reason to fear that, Turkey becoming utterly insolvent,
the SULTAN and his people will be soon in a condition to
be denominated " Pay-nix," or " Pay-nil."
NEW SPORTING NOMENCLATURE.
GIVE a dog an ill name, and hang him. By the account of the
ield,^ this saying applies likewise to the Horse. Conversely it may
be said, Give a horse a good name and—back him. He goes in to
win:—
"It is indubitable, BO far as the British Turf is concerted, that the euphony
and appositeness of his name have often exercised the most potential influence
on the fortunes of a distinguished racehorse. It is a singular circumstance
that, among nearly 300 horses by which the three historical rao«s of Engjnnd
have been hitherto won, there is not n single animal cursed with an ill-
sounding or unseemly appellation."
Hence it appears that Mr. Shandy1 s theory of the influence of
Christian names is confirmed by parallel facts proving the like of it
to hold good with regard to that noble animal the Horse. Mr. Shandy
did not wish his Son to be " Nicomedns'd into nothing." The same
feeling influences the " stable mind " :—
"About twenty years ago, MR. BOWES requested a brother Member of the
Jockey Club to lay out a considerable sum for him upon one of the best-bred
and best-looking colts that the Streatham paddocks have ever sent up to
Langton Wold. 'I will do your commission with pleasure,' was the dis-
couraging answer,' hut I shall not follow it myself; for it is impossible that
a horse with the name of Griemltts Eiarienf should ever win the Derby.'"
So even the matter-of-fact horsey man has a spice of superstition
in him. As touching horses, at least, he believes in the " magic of
a name." Of course he would object to names for racehorses which,
if racehorses had sponsors, some sponsors would give them in view
of the ignoble purposes to which those noble animals are made sub-
servient. Racehorses then, like Ironclads, as the Devattatwn^ the
Warrior, and so forth, would receive names which, if not eligible
for euphony or seemliness, would however be significant. As, for
example: Attutetieta, Concealment, Dectption, Dishonour, False-
hood, Knavery, Meannets, Roguery, Rascality, Subtlety, Treachery,
Trickery—appellations expressing the qualities and attributes which
chiefly characterise and actuate Betting-men. Also denominations
representing the crimes which horsey clerks and shopmen are apt to
be led into by gambling, as Embezzlement, Rubbery, and Forgery.
Likewise the terms denoting the various blackguards who undertake
the underhand and dishonest practices which discredit the Turf, as
Tauter, Tipper, Scratcher, Welcher, and Thimllerig: to which
might be added Repudiation, Levanter, and—were jockeying bond-
holders a sufficiently horsey trick—Grand Turk.

And JOHN, though he wills that all faiths should be free,
Turns up nose at the ill-smelling Jesuit-leaven
You 'd spread, my fine " Priest of St. Leonard's-on-Sea I"
To gloat o'er the capture of foolish young gudgeon
Seems small. But our kidnapping priest doubles parts
Like a knowing fay-burglar, he handles the bludgeon,
As well as the picklock of Jesuit arts.
Nay, fatherly tears are a joke to this " pastor."
Friend JOHN, is this Rome? Then, methinks, you '11 agree
It were well, if you wish in your house to be master,
To watch spies like this "Priest of St. Leonard's-on-Sea!"
Compromise with. Nonconformity.
FROM a quantity of breath lately expended in talk at various
"Diocesan Conferences," it seems that there are not a few Clergy-
men who think it wise to resist the claim of Dissenters to bury their
dead in parish churchyards after their own manner. Argument in
such a matter is useless; but a compromise may be suggested to
reverend gentlemen. Might not a portion of every churchyard be
set apart for the interment of Dissenters; and could not the Incum-
bent or the Bishop, if they thought proper, deconsecrate so much of
it for that purpose t Who would be in any way the worse for this
simple arrangement f

PROUD OF HIS CLOTH!

S the punishment most appropriate
to the offence, H.R.H. the Field-
Marshal Commanding in Chief,
has sentenced an unruly Subal-
tern, who has disgraced Her
Service — by taking
part, first, in some silly practical
yoking at Hythe, and, as a sequel,
in some un gentlemanlike, and,
^,. ™ KKf <i/ I'fiHSD worse, unfair fisticuff* on a public

\i~~T nj f ri-*TTs-l \\ \ of a year constantly in uniform. Until
'/V\ A '"!,,,! \ i now the Queen's coat has been considered
an honour to its wearer, not a disgrace.
However, "we have changed all that," and
may soon expect to see the publication of the
following sentences:—
The Colonial Bishop of Niggerstown, having
insisted upon lighting sixteen candles during
"Morning Celebration," has been ordered to
wear his lawn sleeves at all qroquet parties to

MB. CHBISTOPHEB SHABP, Barrister-at-LaW;

during the Opera season of 1876.
MAJOR-GENERAL SIB HRBCDXES HANNIBAI, K.C.B.. D.C.L., having spoken with dis-

ordered to wear his Doctor's gown in Rotten Row every day for a twelvemonth.
And, lastly, H.R.H. THE DUKE OF CAMBBIDGE, having made a serious mistake, is hereby

A VICAB ON VANITIES.
(Some words with the REV. A. WILLIAMS. Vicar of Kingston, concerning his Vteies wit!
regard to "Dramatic Performances and "Entertainments for the People." fl*
Daily Telegraph, Oct. 20.)
REVEREND SIB,—MB. PUNCH has a profound respect for honest convictions temperately
expressed, however antagonistic they may be to his own opinion. But as it is in the nature
of pulpit Philippics, especially when directed against what are clerically known as " Worldly
Vanities," to be just a little one-sided, he would like to put to you a few questions wit!
regard to your recently reported Sermon.
In the first place, wnat are " Worldly Vanities;" and are there no Vanities which may be
called "other-worldly"? It in not, perhaps, every Stall in Vanity Fair whose badge i
motley, and whose sign is the Cap and Bells. Are there not booths there, sombrely enougl
draped, yet where are vended, at a good price too, such indisputable "Vanities" as spiritua
pride, professional bias, purblind dogmatism, and uncharitable construction? All i
Vanity, said the Preacher of old. Bat modern pulpiteers are apt to be somewhat arbitraril;
eclectic, and to brand as Vanities the things only which they individually or professional!;
dislike. It is well to hold the balance fairly—even in Vanity Fair!
Again you endeavour to give show of logical process to what you please to consider your
"argument," by declaring that "amusements of this description" are demonstrable
nrong, because Scripture pointedly con-
emns " foolish talking and jesting." But
s the sequitur so clear as might be wished?
tfight not the text, with equal show of
ogic, be twisted into a condemnation of
he pulpit, seeing that from that quarter
we have such a superabundance of "foolish
•alking"? Or is stultiloquence more
olerable from the lips of a preacher than
rom the month of a mime?
You do not seem to take the intelligible,
hough disputable, position, that in the
livine economy of things there is no legiti-
mate function for mirth or for amusement,
t is clear then, that it remains to decide
what is permissible amusement and allow-
able mirth. The inquiry demands discrimi-
nation and candour, things not much in
'avour with such sweeping anathematisers
as yourself. But "the Cloth" is fond of
he argument analogical. Shall we say
;hen that because so many Sermons are
lull, idealess, unprofitable, not to say,
'deteriorating," it would, therefore, be
well to abolish the pulpit altogether?
You say that "the whole spirit of such
,hings is as worldly and unscriptural as it
can possibly be." Worldly? Unscriptural?
Vague words. Reverend Sir, which may
mean anything or nothing. la all that is
not distinctively spiritual to be condemned
as worldly, in an evil sense? Is all that is
lot specifically enjoined by Scripture to be
jranded as unscriptural or anti-scriptural?
[s Hamlet "worldly"? Is the Midsummer
Night's Dream "unscriptural"? Or are
;hey, like a large proportion of legitimate
luman works and ways, innocently extra-
scriptural, but no more antagonistic to the
Spirit of the Book we all reverence than a
lily or a laugh? Your Philippic, though
intended to be pungent, seems to lack point
and particularity. There are numberless
details of the daily duties of humanity,
concerning which Scripture gives no specific
i udgment or direction; otherwise you would
hardly, in your indiscriminating condemna-
tion of the Stage, be compelled to fall back
upon doubtful metaphors and distorted texts.
Does it not strike you that the role of
Spiritual Watchman," which you so
readily assume, demands, for its proper
discharge, some judicial faculty and fair-
ness, some knowledge of human life, its
needs and its possibilities? Do the spiritual
policemen who would imprison a child for
picking a flower, or anathematise an adult
for entering a theatre, exhibit that fairness,
or that knowledge—to say nothing of such
minor Christian attributes as mercy or
charity? "The broader the farce, the
more it pleases," say you. But about
sundry ecclesiastical performances of late,
has there not been all of the farce but the
fun? Would it not be well to banish bur-
lesque from the pulpit before falling foul of
it on the stage.? Finally, doffing "the
seven-league boots of self-opinion," would
it not be wise to direct the lively battery
of clerical energy against the proven evils
which beset all human institutions, ecclesi-
astical ones not exoepted, rather than
sweepingly to condemn dramatic perform-
ances and popular entertainments (as one
might as fairly denounce the multitude of
"pulpit ministration" in which you
rejoice) by the aid of illogical appeals to the
misread letter or misrepresented spirit of
Holy Scripture? I pause for a reply; and
holding my lay rostrum of at least equal
dignity with a misused pulpit, do not think
it necessary to apologise for thus catechis-
ing a Catechist before I subscribe myself
Your very obedient Servant,

"OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
Letter 2fo. 3.
DEAB SIB,
HEBE we are again: in India. Oar Indian Empire lies
between 80 Fahrenheit and 120 Reaumur. It is composed of divi-
sions, subdivided into caetee, according to their behaviour. The
First Division is the lowest form, and the lowest form of caste is
not spoken to, or recognised, here, any more than is a man of "bad
form among ourselves, chez nous. The people's religion is mixed:
they have the sacred books of the Deccan, and worship Veda,
Brushnu, and Bogie alternately, according to the weather. I forgot
to add MuMBO-JiTMBO, but I rather fancy that his rites belong
exclusively to the High Church caste in India. I do not pick these
items out of MUUKA r, but have obtained them at first hand, either
from personal observation, or from the KHOKNT Re M M i'w, the dis-
tinguished resident whom I have already had occasion to mention.
On a brilliant November day the Prince will land, and will be
received at Bombay with a ceremonial unequalled since the glorious
days of the Old Lord Mayor's Show, the time of BTTNW, DUCBOW,
and the Lyceum Extravaganzas.
Subject to alteration, here is the programme (in the rough), which
I have already drawn up:—
1. A Band of Papaws on the quay, playing, "Ood Bless the
Prince of Waks."
2. The leading Quava (a kind of High Sheriff), accompanied by
the chief Jamrocks (sort of Deputy-Lieutenants), bearing garlands
and banners.
3. A Bevy of Nautch Girls dancing up and retiring. Tune, "It '*
Nautchy but it't Nice."
4. A Hashish with his Suile, who will read an Address between
them. Solo and chorus.
5. A Regiment of Mangosteens (the very pick of the Native
Troops), mounted on thoroughbred nullcolls. (•»* I can't explain
this, but ask any respectable Indian resident in England, and he '11
tell you.)
6. Eurasians playing on bandicoots. [This last word, of course, is
musically suggestive, and was, no doubt, imported into India from
England. COOT'S band is well-known (I think they call it COOT

mixed words. This is entre nous.']
7. More Nautoh Girls dancing up, scattering garlands, and re-
tiring. (Whenever I am at a loss for any part of the entertainment
on the Prince's tour, I shall always throw in the Nautch girls.
They like it, and so will H.R.H.)
8. Shurjashes in chain armour. (These are all that now remain
of the ancient chivalry of India, of which you've read so much—and
I haven't.)
9. Then will come a procession of Loguats (native Barristers
without wigs) preceding a Yum (a native Judge, with his wig on),
followed by Pumplinoses (Beadles, Ushers, and Officers of the
Native Court, evidently a W9rd of mixed origin for " pimply-nose"),
bearing white wands, and singing hymns to Fu-Rangum (Jugger-
naut's brother—and a great card here).
10. Anglo-Indians and Indo-Anghans led by SIB SAM JAM .11-:n
JBLLYBOY, in coat-tails and turban, who will deliver an address.
11. Ayahs, Punkahs, Pandits, and Nabobs, in full costume, bear-
ing insignia.
12. Nautoh girls, and bells.
That's as far as I've 'got at present, and it promises to make a
pretty big show.
After spending some time here, H.R.H. will be taken by me to a
real treat. He will dine off Jungliwallaht—a. sort of sweet-scented
venison,—and drink the soothing tatous, a. kind of mild champagne,
with only two per cent, of sugar.
At this point I have engaged a party of Western (f lulls (conjurors),
who are the most entertaining dogs in the world. I will tell you
some of their tricks, which would puzzle MB. HOME, the spiritualist,
and make MASKELYNE AND COOEE wild.
One fihiit balances a stick on his nose, while another, a stout
man of about sixteen stone, runs up it, bare-footed, and, when he
has reached the top, he suddenly disappears—apparently into the
air, like the witches in Macbeth. Then a goat, a horse, and,
finally, an elephant,—mind, this is in full daylight, and in an open
plain, no mfcanique, no spring, no deception,—ascend the stick
one after the other, and all, in turn, disappear. Five minutes
afterwards, the stout man, the goat, the horse, and] the elephant,
reappear, quietly making their way through the crowd, which
receives them with enthusiasm.
This ii wonderful, and, sharp as I am, I can not tell how it'»
done. Money won't buy the secret.
This will please H.R.H., as will also the Cheetah, a sort of native
"Jolly Nash," who sings comic songs racy of the soil, after dinner.
Such is life in India.
The next day I shall take H.R.H. to the Begum's Restauration,
where he will be received by the Surra Sahib (or head waiter),
attended by his Chokeet (i.e., the other waiters in white chokers).
The name Cftokee bears the same relation to the Choker as mort-
gagee does to the mortgagor. Again evidently Anglo-Indian.
Then the Prince will taste the most lovely iced durbar that was
*»* fool-Note.—We have a sort of idea that Our Representative is deceiv-
ing us, or that somebody is. From information we 've received, we learn that
a " lluiciltih," described by Our Representative, in his letter last week, as "a
genuine Native Prince," is a sort of palanquin on the back of an elephant
used by tiger-hunters. There can be no such corps as a "guard of Tillini"—
if tiffin be the Indian word for Luncheon, as we ore now told it is. Again, a
"coolie" cannot be flashed in the air, </a " coolie"—as a real Indian, MAJOR
RYCB CHUTNEY, has written to us to say—means "a man of low caste."
Should Our Representative insist on extra pay for his " looal colouring," he
shall get it—pretty strongly—when he presents himself at our office. We
print his letter, and suspend our judgment. Only, we do advise our readers
to consult some dictionary of Indian words and phrases—such a vocabulary
as may be found in any book about the Sports of India, or Mu. SALA'S excel-
lent prospective account of the Prince's tour, recently published in the I/lut-
t ml id London Neiai, where, we are informed, many of the words used in Our
Representative's letter appear. But, in any cose, if our reader* will kindly
inform us whenever they catch Our Bepresentative tripping, they will be
doing good service to the Public, and conferring a benefit on the Editor.

How to Furnish it Home for a Composer.—Every article of fur-
niture should be instrumental in affording him assistance at his
work of genius. Nothing should be lost
His chairs should combine the harp ai
the back and the pianette in the seat.
The glasses on his table should be each
of a different tone, and BO arranged as to
produce the most melodious tunes ai
every meal.
The patterns on his plates should be in
musical notes, and these would exhibit
his peculiar crotchets in decorative art.
His fire-place should be five bars. His
tongs should be two quavers, and his
poker another quaver, and they could
stand on clefs. Nothing more simple,
nor, I may add, to the artistic mind,
more touching.
What for a flower-stand can be more

and also not to allow of the escape of the water so necessary for
the support of the flowers.
For the Composer's Washing-Stand, what better than a drum

BEEF AT A CHURCH CONGRESS.
(See Letter by a "WEST SOMERSET PARSON" in the Times, Oct. 20.)
THERE is a Country Parson of Western Somerset,
He seems as wise a Parson as Punch has ever met;
He finds the tenant of his glebe at law and justice mocks,
And sends to London market cow by the name of ox:
He finds,.moreover, that said cow, seller and buyer weeting,
Died in a state which rendered it most questionable eating.
He does not stay to sermonise—he writeth to the Times;
He says that selling beef that's bad is quite a crime of crimes:
He states that the bucolic lout, extremely fond of pelf,
Will send to Leadenhall Market what he would not eat himself—
He really doesn't think it a wicked thing to do,
Just poisoning with meat diseased a Lunnon chap or two.
Punch likes idyllic country life, and really feeleth loth
To think that Arcades amlo too oft means "blackguards both;"
Yet might the term apply full well, he verily must avow,
To the man who sold, and also to him who bought, that cow.
And he thanks the Somerset Parson for coming to relief
Of the unsuspecting Cockney who prefers wholesome beef.
For what says he, the Parson? Unlikely you would guess:
This, that such tricks are the thing to moot at the Church's next
Congress.
Altar or Table battle is squabble very slight;
'Twixt con- or trans- substan-tiate is hardly worth a fight;
Wear alb or surplice as you will—long petticoats, short sleeves:
But High or Low should teach their flocks they ought not to be thieves.
Sail, 0 West Somerset Parson! Go on as you 've begun,
Archbishop Punch declares the Church has not a wiser son.
fou know the way to check the men who swindle and overreach:
_f your sermons are not very long, he '11 come and hear yon preach;
And afterwards, right willingly, go home with you to lunch
On steak of ox (with oyster-gauce) fit for the plate of Punch.

ADMIRALTY GUIDE.
(Out of the Fog.)
THERE appears to have been considerable misapprehension among
officers of the Royal Navy as to the line of conduct to be adopted
under certain circumstances. All doubts, however, on these points
must have been removed by the decision of a recent Court-Martial
and the Admiralty minute thereupon.
For the benefit of the Service we give a short summary of the
instructions which appear to be conveyed.
For Admirals.
Admirals in command of a squadron will regulate the speed of the
ships composing it, but will not be responsible for accidents which
may arise from the rate of speed being improper.
On the approach of fog, a gun may be fired from the flagship;
care being however taken that the gun used is not heavy enough to
be heard oy the other ships of the squadron. (Suitable pieces of
ordnance for this purpose may be obtained at the Model Dockyard
in the Strand.)
For Captains commanding Ironclads in Squadron.
No alteration of speed or course must under any circumstances
be made on the Captain's own authority.
Should a vessel be unfortunately discovered across the bows, the
Admiral must be signalled to, and his directions awaited. If, how-
ever, the vessel in danger be the Admiralty yacht, carrying their
Lordships, the Captain of the Ironclad may, on his own responsi-
bility, order life-buoys to be got ready; that intended for the First
Lord being at once decorated with red cloth.
In the event of fog coming on, steam is immediately to be shut off
from the whistle, or it might inadvertently be sounded, thus giving
notice of your whereabouts to some other ship, and enabling ner to
get out of your way. or perhaps to ram you; in which case, of
course, you would be held responsible for the disaster.
Should this however occur, the diver belonging to the ship will
immediately assume his dress and descend to inspect the leak.
On his return he will prepare a written report of its size, &c., and
upon this report, countersigned by the Captain, the necessary quan-
tity of oakum, spare sails, and hammocks will be handed to the
Carpenter, in order that he may at once arrest the influx of water.
Should all endeavours be unavailing, and the ship continue to
settle down, the efforts to save her are on no account to cease; but
when the ship commences her final plunge, and the decks begin to
burst up, boats' crews may be piped away and the boats lowered.
The men must not, however, be allowed to get into them until the
water is level with the hammock nettings. It must be strictly
borne in mind that the preservation of the crew is entirely a minor
consideration. Men may be had at any time at the usual rate
of pay, but modern vessels of war cost both time and money, and
the loss of one may even cause the addition of a halfpenny to the
Income-tax.
The above instructions have special reference to ships getting into
a fog, and by inducing a corresponding state of mind with those in
command, may be of the utmost practical utility.

A TELEOBAH from Hong-Kong the other day confirmed the report
that the Gordon Castle had landed at Shanghai sixty tons of Henry-
Martini ammunition for the Chinese Government. It does not much
signify, but the telegram would have been more welcome if it had
announced that the ammunition landed was all Betty-Martini.

WEAK MOMENTS.
IIEN I yielded to the per-
sistent solicitations of
MBS. GILLIPLOWBK, and
migrated with the whole
of my family (ten souls in
all), for six weeks, from
a comfortable home at
Upper Norwood, to un-
comfortable lodgings at
Stragglesea; where we
had indifferent cooking,
defective sanitary
arrangements, a high
average of easterly winds,
several inches of rainfall,
a carriage accident, a dim-
tor's bill, and an unex-
pected and unwelcome
affaire de occur, in which
the rapidly advancing
tide, a Newfoundland
dog, a Lieutenant of
Militia, and my second
daughter, MO»A FBANCES
OAKOI.L.NK, all played a
conspicuous part.
When I allowed my
eldest daughter, LEILA
KATHARINE, to contract
an engagement with MR. BOUNOBROKE JAXON, a young engineer,
who hopes, through his cousin, who is a connection of the wife of one
of the Directors, to get an appointment under a Company now in
formation for the purpose of supplying the Fiji Islands with tram-
ways. Seeing that BOLINQBSOKE has been a regular visitor at Upper
Norwood twice a week, and always on Sundays, for the last three
years, and that his views on politics, Church questions, education,
the drama, and smoking, are directly opposed to mine, and that he
is subject to violent sneezing fits, and invariably only just catches
the last train at night, it will surprise no one—certainly no father—
to be told that the Polynesian project has my best wishes for its
successful accomplishment.
When I gave my sanction to our two youngest boys, WILLIAM and
liuFi's, keeping poultry in the back premises, on the understanding
that they should bear the entire expenses of the establishment, and
furnish the family breakfast table with a constant supply of fresh
laid eggs at a very liberal rate of remuneration. WILLIAM and
RUFUS have altogether failed to fulfil their engagements, and I have
been summoned to appear at the Police Court, to answer a complaint
from the neighbours that our "Bright Chanticleers proclaim the
dawn" with distracting loudness and unnecessary frequency.
When I was cajoled into a little dance with refreshments, which
was artfully expanded into a regular ball and supper, to the serious
depletion of my pocket, the detriment of the furniture, the complete
upset of all domestic comfort both before and after the rout, and the

by STKPIIKN CABBAWAY, citizen and grocer, in lo(>5, where he was
diligently instructed in XENOPHON'S Anabasis and OVID'S Metamor-
phoses, as the best possible training for his future career as a clerk,
and probable partner, in the old-established house of GILLIFLOWEK,

from brilliant meteors in the heavens to enormous potatoes in the
earth, none of which ever found a corner in the columns of the
paper in question.
When 1 deeply offended my Aunt MABTHA—one of the old school,
who had all the washing done at home, insisted on her maids wearing
large frilled caps, and would not allow them to speak even to
the Postman, if she could prevent it—by needlessly constituting
myself the champion of the servants as against their mistresses, so
that she made a new will within the week, and left the bulk of her
property (sworn under £80,000) to the Home for Blighted Hearts at
Nozzlebrooke.
When I began by throwing out that bay-window to the dining-

greatly improved the sleeping accommodation by the addition of
two or three bed-rooms, and finally rebuilt the kitchens, out-
premises, and stables; so that for five years, on and off, I was
always moving in a circle of masons, carpenters, plasterers, painters,
and other costly artificers.
GLIMPSES OF THE FUTURE.
MB. PUNCH'S prophetic inspiration is a matter of world-wide
notoriety, and when in the peculiar mesmeric condition into which he
occasionally lapses after dinner he is more than usually clairvoyant.
"Rapt into future times" the other evening, Mr. Punch dis-
tinctly saw a copy of a morning paper (second edition) dated
November 1st, 1883, in which were the following interesting items
of intelligence:—
LATEST TELEGRAMS.
Plymouth, 4 A.M.
Last night, Her Majesty's Ironclad Ships, Dicer, Blunderer, Lob-
sides, Crusher, Submarine, Downshire, Founderer, and Mudlark,
forming the Channel Fleet, and which had in the morning been got
off the sandbank on which they grounded the day before, ran into
one another, and all went down in deep water. Officers and crews
all saved by taking to the boats a quarter of an hour before the
collisions.
7 A.M.
Nothing is visible of the sunken vessels. An Admiralty official
with a numerous staff has already left for the purpose of making a
minute inspection of the waves beneath which the submerged vessels
are supposed to be.
9A.M.
The cause of the untoward event is supposed to have been the
extreme clearness of the night, the brilliancy of the moon having a
decided effect upon the commanding officers. The fleet of boats had
quite a picturesque effect coming into harbour, the men receiving
an ovation. It has already been decided that the Admiralty tug
ll~«slitu/i shall cruise in the Channel for the protection of the coast
until the fleet can be replaced. She will have her funnel repainted,
and be re-christened " The Tug of War." A telegram has been
received from the QITEEN, expressing a hope that none of the officers
or men have taken cold.
9'30 A.M.
Immediate orders will be issued for the construction of eight new
Ironclads—two on the circular principle, two on the three-cornered,
two on the telescopic, and two on the upside-down principle. A
diver has just been down, and brought up a capstan-bar and a
cocked-hat, as well as his breakfast. Nothing further can be done
till the Spring.
CONSTANTINOPLE.—A decree has been made that in future all in-
terest on Turkish loans shall be paid half in Turkey Sponge and
half in Turkey Rhubarb.
NORWICH.—The Election Inquiry Commissioners resumed their
sitting this morning. After hearing the evidence of the oldest in-
habitant, who is stone-deaf, and the potboy of the " Goat in Boots,"
who is an idiot, and whose answers gave considerable amusement to
the Court, the inquiry was again adjourned.
A new Magazine will appear at Easter. MB. GLADSTONE, the
late Member for Greenwich, nas promised to contribute a series of
papers on " The Past, Present, and Future of the Hot-Crossed Bun:
its influence on the Established Church and the Digestion," &o.
The Little-Smashington Line was closed yesterday. It is a single
line, with several level crossings, and the Authorities have deemed
it prudent, considering the loss of the entire rolling stock (with the
exception of an engine and a trolly) during the Excursionist Season,
to close the Line until next Autumn.'
The Detectives are still actively engaged in their search for
ALKXANDBB COLLIE. They are confident they possess a clue.
The 81-ton gun burst in Fleet Street yesterday, immediately in
front of No. 85, and
• ***•*
It was a knock at the door, and Mr. Punch's trance was at an
end.

"GENTLEMEN—LORD DABNLEY!"
LOBD DABNLEY has given the Mayor of Gravesend notice to quit a
farm of which his Lordship is the landlord and his Worship is the
tenant. The Mayor is under the impression that LOBD 1>.\ UNLK v
would not have ejected him had he (the Mayor) consented to put
pressure upon his son with a view to causing a gap in the ranks of
the West Kent Yeomanry Cavalry. LORD DARNLEY is ex-Colonel
of the celebrated corps in question, and MB. LAKE (the Mayor's son)
is one of the troopers. LORD DABNLEY having incidentally testified
to his love for "feudal tradition," expects his tenants to do their
duty—that is to quit the service of Her Majesty the (JUKKN at the
order of their ex-Commanding Officer. The Mayor of Gravesend
has refused to put the necessary pressure upon his patriotic son, and
Mr. Punch rejoices to say, MB. LAKE, junr., is still a member of
the West Kent Yeomanry Cavalry. The lengthy correspondence
between the Mayor and the Earl has resulted in the QUEEN having
one soldier the more and LOBD DABNLEY one tenant the less.
Under these circumstances, Mr. Punch hastens to inform the
Public that there is not the slightest foundation for the report
that LOBD DABNLEY is about to issue the following characteristic
circular:—
IB. To OUR WOULD-BK TENANTS. E.
Cobham Hall, October, 1875.
LOBD DABNLEY begs to say that no wish to get rid of the Mayor
of Gravesend personally emanated from his pen. On the contrary,
so far from itpeing so, his Lordship might as well have put up his
farms to public competition, and indeed it would be foolish not to
do so.
LOBD DABNLEY would explain that all he wanted the Mayor of
Gravesend to do was to make his son follow his example in giving
up his commission in his late regiment, where he had found things
not pleasant, and which good feeling (as he must know) would have
induced him to leave a corps which has been personally a source of
annoyance to him. No further wish than this emanated from his
pen.
LOBD DABNLEY begs to say, that if any one personally has any
difficulty in finding put the meaning of the above paragraph, that
it is immaterial to his Lordship whether he accepts it as written or
according to any other construction he may be pleased to place upon
it. However he disclaims the idea of puzzling persons personally.
In fact, nothing of the kind has emanated from his pen.
LORD DABNLEY would explain that he expects would-be tenants
to be free as the air, and he disclaims the idea that he wants to
control anything more of their movements than all the actions of
their public and private lives. So long as his tenants do exactly
what LOBD DARNLET wishes, they are perfectly at liberty to do
what they like, and it is immaterial to him whether they accept
anything as it is written or according to any other construction that
they may please to place upon it. This is his opinion from a mone-
tary point of view; and had he thought it would not have been
sufficient notice, he 'would have been glad and ready to give it.
However nothing of the kind has emanated from his pen.
LOBD DABNLEY, moreover, begs to say that any very enterprising
gentlemen residing at Birmingham or Liverpool, or wherever else
you will, would answer every purpose. LOKD DABNLEY would also
say that, in conducting an angry correspondence, he is in the habit of
addressing his opponent as "Dear Sir," and signing himself "Yours
very faithfully," and it is immaterial to him whether any other
construction is placed upon it. LORD DABNLEY has adopted these
forms because he avowedly claims to write with grace, grammar,
and generosity. As he is about to start for Scotland, however, little

LORD DABNLKT begs to say that the following paragraph is as

LORD DABNLEY does desire and intend to have a resident tenant

also to say that to say (as some of the Press cay) that LOBD DAKNI.KY
would have lost his head on the scaffold, for trying to break up one
of Her Majesty's Regiments, had he lived hundreds of years ago, is
immaterial to him. He begs to say (indeed, it would be foolish not
to do so) that it would have been utterly impossible to have deprived
him personally of his head. Nothing of the kind has emanated
from nis pen.

Repudiation and Revolt.
PENDING an insurrection in Herzegovina, the Turkish repudiation
was peculiarly inopportune. By renouncing their obligations to
their bondholders just now, the SULTAN and his Government not
only justify the Herzegovimans in throwing off their bondage, but
also set Crete, and all their other discontented provinces the
example of rejecting their bonds too. This repudiation, if tried,
will be preventible only by force, and then, the Sublime Porte
just having cheated ita creditors, now on earth will it possibly be
able to borrow money to carry on the war?

VACCINATION AND WISDOM.
AMONG the Boards of Guardians in England and Wales, there is,
whatever satirists may say, a considerable number comparatively at
least endowed with immense wisdom. Our friends the Keighley
Board lately held a meeting, thus reported by a contemporary:—
"OFFICIAL OPPOSITION TO VACCINATION.—At the meeting of the Keigh-
ley Board of Guardians yesterday afternoon, fifty letters were read in answer
to an anti-vaccination memorial which had been sent by the Board to all the
Boards of Guardians in the kingdom. Not one of the replies concurred with
the opinions expressed in the memorial."
The absolute amount of cense indicated by this difference of
opinion is, to be sure, no more than ordinary. Relatively to the
common understanding it does not appear to be above the average,
and might in fact be below it. Nevertheless, it is evident that there
are no less than fifty British Boards of Guardians endowed with
intelligence in a measure whereby they immensely exceed those of
Eeighley. Indeed, the replies of some of these fifty Boards evince
even a degree of aouteness:—
"The MerthyrTydfil Board said they thought that the Eeighley Board
must have gone mad, and hoped the laws would bring them to their senses.
The Stafford Guardians enclosed a copy of a resolution which had been passed
by them to the effect that' the Eeighley Board ought to be sent to an asylum,
and made to pay their expenses.'"
Hereupon it is significantly added :—
"No remarks were made by the Guardians."
Although they could not be sent literally to an asylum for idiots,
the Keighley Guardians were, as to their anti-vaccination drivel,
conclusively shut up; a reality which it appears they were just
sufficiently sensible to feel.

PUNCH'S WEAtHER-EYE-OPENER.
Ms. PUNCH, resolved not to be 'behind his contemporaries in
enterprise, has determined to publish henceforth a Meteorological
Chart. Allowances are requested for his first attempt, as the young
man who was engaged (on his own representations) for the purpose
apparently knows nothing about drawing, and still;less about
Meteorology.
WEATHER CHART.

.—The arrotet fly with the wind, in fact, 6010 before it.
a, awful; b, beutly j c, cursed; rf, never mind; e, everlasting ; /, frantic.
Rainfall*—"Wet through twice a day, and through the ceilings of
the attics.
Barometrical Readingt.—None. Somebody having smashed the
barometer by tapping it too hard with his umbrella.
Thermometrical Readingt.—None. A youthful and scientific
member of the family having robbed the thermometer of its practical
utility by putting it in the tire to see the mercury run up trie tube.
General Remarks.—Shan't make any, for fear of using bad
language. Dreadful cold in my head.
THE METEOROLOGIST TO MR. PUNCH.
RULE OF THE ROAD WANTED.
THE Iron Duke has, as Ma. O'BRALLAOHAN says, by cannoning
the Vanguard, taught us that the Ram in naval warfare is the best
Gun. Another lesson is suggested by that cannonade. Pedestrians
on land are exposed to collisions as well as mariners at sea. Veloci-
pedes moving with a certain velocity may do similar damage to that
done by Ironclads going so many knots an hour. Foot-passengers
on public thoroughfares need eyes in the napes of their necks to see
them coming. Not seeing them, and particularly in the dark, they
are liable to be run into by them. The approach of the Velocipede
is as silent as that of the Dromedary, or the Camel, the "Ship of
the Desert." Impact from a Velocipede at a high rate of speed is
no joke. Would it not be as well if the riders of Velocipedes were
obliged to carry- little bells, and after sunset lights, in their bows?
Eminence and Innocence.
MANNING is reported to have lately read a paper to the
Catholic Acadeinia, contending that POPB INNOCENT THB THIRD
never condemned Magna Charta, but only the Barons for having
obtained it by levying war against their Sovereign. No doubt his
Eminence made out to the satisfaction of his hearers that the POPE
accused of having anathematised the title-deed of English liberty
was an injured Innocent.

Superstitious Suggestion.
THE following piece of intelligence suggests a question which may
have occurred to sailors:—
"TJIB 'IRON DUKE.'—A Press Association telegram lays: 'On Saturday,
as the Iron Duke was being taken out of Devonport Mock, "she ran foul of the
Itlacl Prince. The latter lost her davits in the collision, but little other
damnge was done.""
Happily. But the Iron Duke is evidently an unlucky ship.
What has made her so? Is it possible that she was, if not launched
or christened, begun on a Friday?
Bavarian Misnomer.
THE Ultramontane and anti-Liberal Party in Bavaria has an
aliat. The Ultramontanes are also called Particular)eta. But (see
the Times) " the Ultramontane Deputies in the recent debate con-
trived to wound the King deeply by applauding and making mirth
over some infamous scurrilities published in a low comic journal
imported from the other side of the Main, and quoted with gusto by
a member of the Opposition." As the Ultramontane Deputies must
be taken to represent their constituents, this outrage provei the
Ultramontanes are not all particular.
No Answers.

A Sovereign Remedy.
M. BorTHEH, who, in the French Chamber as Imperial Minister,
by declaring that the Italians should never go to Rome, earned the
name of a prophet in association with "famais," has been, at Ajao-
cio, cracking up Bonapartism, which brought France to grief. Poor
France is sick of the Imperial dynasty; and it appears that in
recommending her a restoration of the fallen Empire, DR. JAMAIS
would fain prescribe a hair of the dog that bit her.

Before the LOBD CHIEF JUSTICE.
Brown v. Smith.
THIS ease, which has now reached its fortieth year, is of great
interest to the general Public. In 1797 PETER BBOWIT, being then
heir in tail to the estates of Llymcromroh and Chatmysllingo, North
Wales, married, and had five children, of these THOMAS (cujut ett
tolum ejut ett usque ad calum), was the co-heir, with a contingent
remainder to BAKTS AHA.
At this point the Jury said they had made up their minds, and
found the prisoner Guilty.
The LOBD Cure*- JUSTICE, having ordered both Plaintiff and
Defendant to stand in the dock, said, that the Jury were doubtless
aware that the intricate gloom of Chancery was henceforth to be
illumined by the pure light of Common Law. His Lordship,
addressing the prisoners, said that, in the whole course of his pro-
fessional career, he had never had to try so bad a nase as this. The
prisoners had tried to find shelter behind the quibbles of Chancery
by dubbing themselves Plaintiff and Defendant. That only inadi-
their case worse. He would sentence l!i«>« N to twelve months'
imprisonment with hard labour, and SMITH to seven years' penal
servitude, regretting, at the same time, that he could not have them
both soundly flogged.
The Plaintiff and Defendant, who seemed verv much surprised, if
not gratified, at the sudden termination of this protracted case,
were.then removed in custody.
Before the LOUD CHANCELLOB.
WILLIAM Sios, thirty-five, thief, was charged with the wilful
murder of his wife. The case has already been fully reported in
our columns. The facts of the murder having been clearly proved,
The LOBD CHANCELLOR, in the course of an elaborate judgment of
four hours' duration, remarked that all those in Court were doubt-
less aware that the intricate gloom of Common Law was henceforth
to be illumined by the pure light of Chancery. His Lordship,
having quoted a great number of precedents, said that the judgment
in the case of Thompson v. Green compelled him to discharge the
rule.
The Prisoner, after remarking that he had never been called a
rule before, hastily left the Court.
BRAVO, PROFESSOR 1
IT is seldom indeed that "Parliament out of Session," or in it
either, is redeemed from dulness by such a passage as the following
in PBOFESSOB FAWCETT's late speech delivered at the North London
and Hackney School of Art and Science Annual Prize Distribution.
Speaking of the cultivation of the aesthetic faculties derivable from
works of nature, the Professor having, "evidently with the deep
sympathy of his audience," referred to the calamity which has for
twenty years past denied him the pleasure of looking upon them,
said:—
'• It was perhaps because he had once enjoyed that pleasure, and could do
so no longer, tbai he could estimate what a precious privilege it was, and
during the ten years he had been in Parliament there was nothing in his work
he regarded with so much satisfaction as his endeavours to preserve Epping
Forest, the New Forest, and the beautiful commons which still remained,
from being sacrificed to the selfishness of individuals and a contemptible
parsimony."
This declaration was received with cheers, to which might have
been deservedly added "three times three" for the LORD MA YOU
and Corporation of London, as the saviours of Epping Forest, and as
many rounds of hisses and groans for the individuals to whose self-
ishness that and the New Forest, and sundry beautiful commons,
were like to have been sacrificed; and likewise for the Administrators
who wished to sacrifice them from motives of contemptible parsimony.

IRISH "AT HOMES."
AT a time when the representatives of the Emerald Isle are urging
in the Honse of Commons and elsewhere the necessity of giving to
Ireland " Home Rule," Mr. Punch does not think it necessary to
apologise for calling attention to two little meetings held recently
at Waterford and Bally Grioken. The first was a banquet given on
the occasion of the turning of the initial spadeful of earth of the
proposed new waterworks; the second a meeting of free and inde-
pendent electors, called together to listen to the eloquence of a
certain Irish solicitor, yclept MR. HENKY SARGRNT.
At the banquet, CAPTAIN JOHNSON, J.P., proposed "The Health
of the Municipalities of Ireland." To quote the report :—
"He said that, OB the Mayors of Cork, Limerick, Clonmel, and Wexford
were present, he felt great difficulty in selecting one of the number to respond.
He, however, gave the preference to ALDERMAN WOODS, Mayor of Clonmel."
Now this seemed to be a moderate suggestion, and one that, in
England, would have been hailed with a mild hammering of knives
upon plates—in other words (as the reporters would say), with
"enthusiastic applause." Not so in Ireland. Cork, Limerick, and
Wexford were disgraced, and the fiery champions of municipal
precedence were on their legs in an instant, shouting for justice,
and purple with excitement. The scene was terrible.
"ALDERMAN WOODS and MH. XAGLB, Mayor of Cork, rose simultaneously
to respond.—ALDERMAN WOODS: 'I rise 'MR. NAOLB: 'I beg your
pardon.' (Great uproar, and erics of 'Hear WOODS!' 'Hear NAOLEI')—
A Lni UMAX WOODS (scarcely audible): 'I must request the Mayor of Cork to
take his seat.'—MR. NAOLB . 'I will not, Sir. (Great confusion.) As the
Mayor of the second city 'ALDERMAN WOODS: 'Sit down, Sir, and
don't interrupt me.' (General uproar.) MR. NAOLB: 'As the Mayor of
, I claim '(Terrible uproar, and cries of' Hear WOODS !') ALDBR-
WOOD-S: 'I will not sit do irn, Sir, until I am heard.' MR. NAOLE: 'I
Cork
MAN
have been insulted.'"
And now the time had arrived for the treading upon coat-tails,
and, doubtless, many a gallant Alderman regretted that he had left
his shillelah with his opera-hat in the vestibule. All eyes were
turned towards MR. NAOLE, and " an elegant quarrel" was evidently
expected. Fortunately, discretion even in Ireland is the better part
of valour; and MR. NAGLE, having declared himself insulted, pre-
pared to leave the room, amidst " a scene of great uproar." He was,
however, persuaded to return; and after he had once more taken
his seat at the hospitable board, MR. A.LUKHMAN WOODS returned
thanks. MR. WOODS' observations are not chronicled, bat doubtless
they were of the most edifying character. But the storm was not
over. To quote the report—
"MR. NAOLB followed, stating that CAPTAIN JOHNSON had exhibited a
very ingenious diplomacy in the gingerly manner in which he had proposed
the toast, and held that as Cork was the second city in Ireland, he should
have priority in responding.—MR. HALL, Mayor of Limerick, followed, and
denied that Cork waa more important than Limerick. He denied that Cork
was the second city in Ireland. Ma. NAOLB: 'I rise to >ay 'MR.
HALL: 'Sit down. I did not interrupt you.' (Cries of ' Chair! Chair !')
MR. HALL: 'Let me explain.' MR. NAOLB (very firmly): 'I will not be
interrupted.' (Grin of ! Sit daunt!' and '•Chair! Chair!') MR. HALL
then resumed, and defied any person to show that Cork waa more important
than Limerick. He represented the city of SABSFIBLD. The city was the first
and last city in Ireland to fight for civil and religious liberty, (<j-re.it
cheering.)"
The "very firmly ' I will not be interrupted'" of MR. NAOLE,
the interrupter, was delightfully Irish, and was appreciated at its
proper value. But Ma. HALL had more to say. He did not con-
sider that the question of municipal precedence had been satisfac-
torily settled, so he offered more evidence "on the same side."
Said he—
"If parental importance gave a Mayor priority, he claimed it, because he
had one of the finest daughters in Inland—(great laughter)—and if the
Mayor of Waterford gave any of the fine young fellows he law round the
table a letter of introduction to him in Limerick, he would take care to see
that they were properly introduced to her. (Benetoed laughter.)"
This argument was allowed to settle the question in dispute, and
after the Mayor of Waterford had insisted that the town he repre-
sented should have priority over Cork, Limerick, or Clonmel, the
company (once more to quote the report) "proceeded to spend a
very social evening." Mr. Punch only hopes that digestion waited
on this occasion, on appetite. It is scarcely necessary to say that
in England an uproar is not usually adopted as an excellent sub-
stitute for "brandy and coffee."
The second little meeting was held, as Mr. Punch has already
said, in Bally Grioken. Three hundred good men and true, from
the City of Waterford, were present, and MR. HENRY SARGENT
addressed them from a very appropriate stand—the Bull Post; no
doubt the post to which, in the old times, Bulls, not M.P.'s, were
chained for baiting. The speech began pleasantly.
"MR. SAROENT commenced by calling on those present to give three cheers
for old Ireland. He cheered for Ireland from the depths of his Irish heart.
(Laughter.) He had but one object in view, and that was to be returned
the Home Rule Member for Waterford. If they returned him he would
succeed in blending the orange and the green. (Cheering.) Green was his
colour. [A lad who was convenient to him here knocked off MR. S vim EXT'"
hat.]"
Which, to say the least of it, was very rude, and must have been
inconvenient to MR. SARGENT. However, MR. SARGENT was equal
to the occasion,—and here we have a glimpse of the sort of etiquette
that will be observed on College Green when the Irish House of
Commons meet once more in their old quarters. Says the reporter
of MR. SARGENT :—
"That gentleman turned round, and, with a stick he held in his hand,
amidst roars of laughter, began thrashing all round him with it."
These very striking arguments seem to have had their due effect,
and order was soon restored.
"MR. SAROEXT continued. He said that it was not SAROEST that was
speaking to them that day. (Laughter.)—A Voice: 'Well, maybe it's your
ghost." (Great laughter.)—MR. SAROENT: 'No; it was the spirit of the
great O'CoNNELL that had come back to them through him, to implore of
them to return him (Mil. SAROBNT) to Parliament. (Roars of laughter.)"
And then came a threat that will cause much weeping in Peter-
borough and Bucks :—
"He assured them that the first time he met DISRAELI he would call him
and WHALLEV to account lor wanting to pry into the mystery of convent
life."
In spite of this warning, so full of mystery "and vague terror,
MR. SAHGENT seemed to have a kinder side to his character, for he
immediately—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
—" utkcd them to remember that they had immortal souls, and he prayed to
God he and his dear sisters and brothers would all meet in Paradise."
Now, after so pleasant and pious a sentiment, it is very sad to
hear what followed.
"A number of little boys here began to throw caps at him, when he turned
on them, amidst a scene of great uproar, and began striking them in every
direction with his stick till order wai restored."
After this little " diversion," MB. SABGENT resumed his speech
denouncing MAJOB O'GoRMAN, and declaring (amidst great laughter)
that the PRINCE OF WALES should succeed HEB MAJESTY (whom he
requested to yacate the throne), with a view to founding " Balmoral
in Ireland." After quoting MILL'S Political Economy and Lord
Chesterfield's Letters, he brought his speech to a quaint conclusion
by observing that—
"He believed in the spirits of the departed coming back to this world, and
hoped no man would wear any colour but green."
A colour, by the way, very appropriate to the believers in Spiri-
tualism.
And yet, after these two meetings, there will be people, Mr.
Punch will be bound to say, who will still declare that Home-Rule
is not a good thing for Ireland!

SOCIAL SLAVERY.
IKPATHISING MB. PUNCH,
PRAT let me call your
notice to this paragraph:—
"The well-known work en-
titled Le Monde Slave, by M.
LBGER, hae been supplemented
by a very timely Tolume of
f.tudti Slaves, by the same
author."
By "Le Monde" I may
•presume the writer means
"Le JBeau Monde," to
which I have the honour,
and the labour, to belong.
Although the work may
be well known, I confess
I never read it, for really
1 've so many other things
to do. But I perfectly
agree with the title —
"Le Monde Slave.'" Yes,
indeed! We slave from
morn till night, and from
year's end to year's end.
It is very fine to say
that Britons never, never,
never will be slaves; but
the fact is that we all of
us, who belong to le beau
monde, live a life of constant slavery, from which we never, never,
never can be free. Noblesse oblige. See how hardly we all slave in
London through the Season; and when the summer ends, we have
the slavery of travelling, when we so want to be quiet, or of
entertaining people whom we so want not to see. Or we have the
hard labour of visiting our relatives, and everybody who is anybody
knows exactly what that means. Then, again, we have to slave to
get our daughters off our hands, and get good places for our sons;
and what with all the daily work and worry of dressing-, driving,
dining, and occasionally dancing, I 'm sure not even the Negroes in
Cuba are greater slaves than we are, and I wish heartily that some
one would endeavour to emancipate us, and set us free to live exactly
as we like. Meanwhile, believe me,
Yours in thraldom,
URSULA FITZ-BATTLEAXE.

Ovations and Omelets.
BT telegram from Munich we are apprised that:—
"K r xi! Louis has declined with thanks to accept an oration which it was
intended to make in his honour on his arrival in the capital."
There is a disaffected party in Munich who might perhaps have
attempted to render the KING OF BAVASIA'S ovation in the literal
sense an. egging. lu that sense, an ovation differs materially
from an omelet. Omelets, if not sweet, are savoury; but the
ovation with which a Sovereign is likely to be assailed by a rebel-
lious faction might turn out an unsavoury one.

THE BISHOP'S BAN.
"THH BISHOP OF RIPON ON MONUMENTAL INSCRIPTIONS.—A letter has
been received from the BISHOP OP RIPON, in reply to MB. DAVID HOTLK, of
New York (U.S.A.), who desired to have cut on the gravestone over the
grave of his father, in the churchyard of Marsden, near Huddersfield, the
words 'Sequietcat in pace.' The Incumbent of Marsden (the R«v. T. WHIT-
NEY) refused to allow the inscription to be cut on the stone, and on an appeal
to the BISHOP OP EIPON, his Lordship replied:—' I am truly sorry to find
myself unable to comply with your request. I cannot sanction the inscription
on a tombstone, "Seouietcat in pace." I need not remind you that this is,
in fact, a prayer for the dead. All true Protestants believe that the state of
the departed is fixed the moment after death. The souls of the faithful are
in joy and felicity, and do not need our prayers. Lost souls could not be
benefited by them.' "—Leeds Mercury, October 23, 1875.
THE cleric mind is a continual feast!
Bishop and Hector, Presbyter and Priest,
All seem of late industriously engaged
In giving Charity, PAUL'S crowning gift,
The tautest tether or the shortest shrift.
The war of dogma, long so hotly waged
In pulpit and polemic tome,
To its last stage is surely come,
By such a chief episcopal when led,
And fought above the gravestones of the dead.
This Overseer of the Church declares
That kindly wishes are as bad as prayers,
When humbly breathed above the grave's grim portal
After the spirit of a parted mortal—
Flown—whither? Who may say? In any case,
The Bishop's cold dilemma stops the way
To all who hope, as to the few who pray,
For any grace
Beyond the ken of the prelatio mind,
Which Heaven's own love in cords of creed would bind.
What! Give the faintest hope the feeblest wing?
Solace with vain lip-woks hearts that grieve
When "that which all true Protestants believe"
Brands the fond impulse futile? 'Tis a thing
That cock-sure dogma may not sanction. No!
Let the departed go,
Unfollowed by good wishes on their way,
Bather than Faith from her straight line should swerve,
Or Charity—the creedless vagrant—stray
Into God's-acre,—priestcraft's last preserve!
And are we then so sure! Have we so soundel
The awful depths of doom,
That hope from the grave's border mast be hounded,
And poor affection vainly plead for room
To carve upon the tomb, where hates should cease,
Her yearning—" Rest in Peace!"'(
When soaring Science set her iron law
Against the plea for prayer, the cleric host
Rebuked with pious zeal the careless boast
Of Sciolists, and bade them kneel in awe
Before the Inscrutable. And now
Cold Dogma, with uplifted brow,
Bids humble aspiration halt before
The tomb's dark door,
Nor dare to desecrate its stone with speech
Of gentler augury than Churches teach.
Nay—stand aside! Let human love have way
Where even hate stays foot! Forbear to play
The Graveyard Cerberus; or else go fix
Your dolorous office on the shores of Styx,
Weigh Charon's freight, assay each erring soul,
Take there your tax and toll,
But cease to ban, with your despotic breath,
These inoffensive courtesies of death.
Brand not for het'rodox poor Hope that dares
Break Creed's fixed bounds, though' twere with humble pray'rs,
That seek for pangs of parting some surcease
In bidding the departed—" Rest in Peace!"

PORTE IN A STORM.
MR. GLADSTONE having refused a Palace on the Bosphorus, and
£50,000 a year, in return for his services as a Turkish Financier,
the Government of the Sublime Porte are said to be turning their
eyes to other quarters in search of a possible substitute for the
eminent English Statesman in question. It is rumoured (it is fair
to say on very unreliable authority) that the following letters have
been received at the Turkish Foreign Office during the last seven
.%*•„ ^or obvious reasons the names of the writers are not given
in full:—
Stoke, October, 1875.
lja". •<*• T, M.P., Q..C., &c. &c., presents his most respectful
compliments to his Sublime Majesty, the SULTAN OF TURKEY, and
deeply regrets that the toil of literary labour, devoted to the
noblest purposes of mankind, prevents him from accepting the very
complimentary invitation of becoming Minister of Finance to Turkey,
the land of the brave and the free, the nation of heroes, and the
terror of slaves. The Doctor feels that he is eminently suited to
nil the post with care, punctuality, patriotism, and the most busi-
ness-like despatch. The Doctor (as doubtless his Sublime Majesty
is aware) can speak Greek, Latin, Hebrew, French, Austrian,
Prussian, German, and Irish. Years ago, too, he could write
English. The Doctor, however, will be glad to send over to Turkey,
the land of the brave and the free, the nation of heroes, and the
terror of slaves, one of his dear sons to represent him. The boy
with the Turkish name would be the most appropriate; but the
SULTAN can take his choice. His Sublime Majesty may have the
pick of the lot. In the event of this proposal being accepted, the
Doctor would wish that all subscriptions to the Magna Charta
Association (prospectus enclosed) may be sent to the President
direct. The Doctor as a man, a father, and a peer of CROMWELL,
must insist upon this in the plainest language possible. Accounts
audited every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Office hours,
from eight to six.
T. R. D. L. October, 1875.
•— —w B T presents his compliments to the SULTAN OF
TURKEY, and regrets to say that previous engagements will prevent
him from accepting the position offered to him by His Majesty.
MK. D N B T, however, would suggest that the only way to
place the Turkish Finances on a satisfactory footing would be to
produce in Constantinople in the off season a new and original
Oriental Drama, with gorgeous scenery and novel effects. The
features of the piece might be a Race (in sacks) on the Bosphorus,
the Burning of a Real Turkish Mosque, and the Celebration (in the
third Act) of a Comic Arab Funeral. The present Turkish Bonds
might be exchanged for Orders for the Upper Circle not admissible
after seven o'clock. Should His Majesty think well of the sugges-
tion, ME. D N B T would be glad to undertake the manage-
ment of the scheme on sharing terms. Provincial Rights in the
Herzegovina to be arranged for after the production of the piece in
Constantinople.
Peterborough, Oct., 1875.
MR. W T, M.P., indignantly refuses to become Finance Minis-
ter to the Sublime Porte. MR. W T, M.P., begs to say that he
believes the SULTAN OF TURKEY to be as wily a Jesuit as CARDINAL
MANNING himself.

England^ Oct., 1875.
MR. E. A. S N regrets to say that it is utterly impossible for
him to accept the office of Finance Minister with the title of Pacha.
MR. E. A. S N feels that the SULTAN OF TURKEY has written to him
under a misapprehension of the facts of the case. Lord Dundreary
is merely a creation of the brain. MR. E. A. S N, however, cor-
dially agrees with His Majesty that were Lord Dundreary a real
parsonage, his Lordship would be just the man to arrange the details
of Turkish Finance.
85, Fleet Street, E.G., Oct., 1875.
MB. P CH is surprised at the impudence of the SULTAN.
Turkish repudiation is a disgrace to civilisation, and His Majesty
deserves to be brought before a Judge and a common jury. Mr.
P ch begs to state that should any further messengers be des-
patched from Constantinople to the Punch Office, Toby will arrange
matters with them on their arrival!
THE PROFESSOR OF THE FUTURE.
THIS Lady Professor's so wondrous wise,
Her very face is a study;
She mounts a pair of celestial blue eyes,
And her mouth's small ellipsis is ruddy.
To masculine pupils of various age
She lectures,—for such is her duty;
And the old ones think her an absolute sage,
And the young ones a perfect beauty.
Her small white hand has a clenching force,
If sometimes her facts look like fiction;
And, whate'er be the logic of her discourse,
Her smiles breed instant conviction.
Such sweet little theories doth she advance,
And her eyes emit proofs so thickly,
Her senior disciples fall into a trance,
Her junior in love as quickly.
Now, though Punch's opinion should go for nought,
Or be slighted as merely funny,
He holds that if thus the old fellows be taught,
The boys will get most for their money.
THE OLD, OLD STORY.
IN CESAR'S time, as he tells us at the beginning of his Commen-
iriet, " O/Hiiis Gallia divisa est in ires partes." So it is still,—the
hree parties being Legitimists, Bonapartists, and Republicans.
Only CAESAR is wanting.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
THE CLERK OF THE WEATHER TO MR. PUNCH.

FIE, MB. PUNCH!
That you should
join in the Chorus
of Cnmmination
which perpetu-
ally assails me!
Still I know your
forte is fairness,
and your foible
indulgence; your
motto "Strike,
but hear!" And
I think I can say
a few words for
myself, if you
will listen.
"Clerk of the
Weather" you
call me. Well,
I should like to
see the mundane
clerk who could
successfully con-
trol so much as
the smallest sub-
branch in my
establishment.
The department
of Sprin g Showers
in your dot of
an island alone,
would, I suspect,
drive your astu-
test Bank Direc-
tor to distraction
in the twirling of
a meridian. And
consider what I
have to look after!
But, of course,
nobody does con-
sider : blind abuse
comes so much
easier. Of course it doesn't much matter. You may rave till all is blue—in TTSIIAu.'s
sense—and not stay a seemingly superfluous rain-drop, divert a too torrid sun-ray, or ruffle
my equanimity. Indeed, you may thank your lucky stars that I um impervious to abuse
as to entreaty, and do not put the reins of my power into the hands of every pseudo-Phaethon
of the moment. But 1 have compassion on the sufferers from meteorological miseries, of
which, I confess, you Islanders have a Benjamin's portion, and mean to give mortals a hint
or two through their sagest representative—yourself! You know what unthankful rule is,
and are familiar with the manners and customs of well-tended but recalcitrant donkeys.
Look here, then I Why not try and work with me, instead of railing at me? E. g.
I supply the rain—more than you appear to relish sometimes—you provide the cistern,
the watercourse, the sluice, the umbrella, and the waterproof. _ I furnish the material,
you the means of utilisation, distribution, defence or prevention, as the case may be.
Carry this partial co-partnership out on the large scale, and there you are. Twig P The
rain I send must fall on the just and the unjust, the thirsting plain, and the thronged
promenade, the turnips, and the turnip-growers, who want it, and the ripening ears and
holiday pleasure-seekers, who do not. A Local-Sun-and-Shower-Distribution Company,
Limited, IB not possible in my realm. I have the round World to look to, not Little Peddlington
only. But Little Peddlington can help
itself if it will.
The fact is, you monocular mortals suffer
far more from drought and deluge, damp
and dirt, discomfort and disease than there
is any necessity for. Why ?—For want of
forethought, providence, ingenuity. Pre-
vention of a large portion of the woes you
attribute to the vagaries of the Clerk of the
Weather are "within the resources of
Science," as the newspapers say. Let
human ingenuity, which, after so many
rain-discomforted generations, achieved
the l.Oingham and the Macintosh, set to
work on the great scale at the task of
adaptation, utilisation, self-protection, and
the Chronic Grumbler's occupation will be
pretty nearly gone. You have not half
exhausted the sweet utilities of the Conduit
and the Tank; nor, in spite of your much-
mouthed proverb, do you really cultivate
the useful art of providing for or against a
Rainy Day. You bear, grumblingly, all
the evils incidental to the alterations of
draught and deluge, from damp feet to
drowning, from scorched noses to sun-stroke
and water-famine, when by timely provi-
sion and intelligent economy you might
strike a normal balance between plentiful
lack and unmanageable superfluity, dodge
discomfort, shun disaster, and minimise
loss.
You don't expect me to play the part of
universal Sangster, street-cleaner, hy-
draulic engineer, and sanitary inspector,
do you P If you won't play those very
practicable roles yourself, Maine your own
unwisdom, not the Weather. Grumbling
at the Weather is about as wise as tilting
at windmills. _ Set your vanes to the wind,
and it will grind your corn for you: direct
and store your floods, and they will serve
instead of swamping you; rightly manage
your streets and subways, and my rains
will be not much less welcome or more
worrying on the flags than on the furrows.
Whether they result in refreshment or
rheumatism depends largely on yourselves.
Here be a few examples out of many
possible ones. Verbum sap., my dear
Punch. Sorry to incommode you, I'm
sure 1 Would gladly find you a weather-
proof private Paradise—a bright little isle
of your own. where north-easter* never
wandered, and St. Swithin was unknown—
if you would accept it. But I know you
would not. The World and 85, Fleet Street
cannot spare you. Noblesse oblige, eh?
But do just tell the stupids and the mn-ants
what I say.
How large, of weather-woes which men endure,
The part that sumphi may cause and skill might
cure!
No more time now. There's another
"tap" requires turning on. Au Reser-
voir 1
Yours plnvially,
THE CLERK OF THE WEATHER.
\3fr. Punch gladly prints this commu-
nication. Even if his accustomed courtesy
did not constrain him, the maxim, Fas
[st et ab hoste doceri, would move him to
compliance with the C. of the W.'s request.
Wisdom may derive a few wrinkles even
From a special-pleading Jupiter Pluviut.]

IMITATION being the sincerest form of flattery, a few admirers of the Light Brigade
intend to celebrate the anniversaries of the following charges:—
November 9.—HKEE Vow CHEATEMTORF, of the Golden Fleece Baden-Baden, celebrates
the ninth anniversary of the famous day when he charged VISCOUNT NOODLE five pounds
for his bed and breakfast.
November 11.—M. MACAIBE, H6tel du Grand Voleur, Paris, celebrates the first anniversary
of the glorious day when he charged SIE SMITH and SIE BBOWN thirty-five pounds for a week's
accommodation.
November 20.—ANGUS McCoRKiroN, Rob Roy Hotel, Glen Stealaoh, N.B., celebrates the
third anniversary of the unco' guid day when he charged a party of Frenchmen sixteen
shillings for eight small glasses of whiskey.
December 2.—The BISHOP OF DOUBLE GLOUCESTER celebrates the eighth anniversary of
the pious day when, in his charge to his Clergy, he forbade them the use of scent on
their pockethandkerchiefs, and the playing of croquet.
December 17.—A Contented Nephew celebrates the nineteenth anniversary of the
fortunate day when his Rich Uncle put so large a charge of powder in his gun that he blew
himself to smithereens, and thereby enabled the aforesaid Contented N ephe w to take possession
of his large estates.
STRANGE COMPANY.
WONDEES will never cease, while people advertise their wants. As for instance, thus:—
A LADY of Good Education desires a POST as COMPANION.
We have heard, when on board ship, of a companion ladder, but we never before heard
of a companion post. Really, a post seems an odd thing to desire for its companionship.
For ourselves, we had far rather make a crony of a walking-stick. There are so many
kinds of posts, too, that we wonder that the lady does not specify her preference. For
light company perhaps a lamp-post would be suitable; but at afl. events at night one
might find comfort in a bed-post.

Theirs but to drain all dry,—

Walked the Two Hundred I
Bottles to right of them,
Bottles to left of them,
Bottles in front of them,
While the band thundered:

Boldly they went to work,
After the eatables
Fell to their knife and fork,—
Thirsty Two Hundred!
A La Rutte might surprise,
Still they knew joints and pies,
Clearing the dishes there,
Relei-t's and entrees, while
Scared waiters wondered;
Then, plunged in 'bacca smoke,
Glasses and pipes they broke—
Comrades long sundered,
Big with old lark and joke,
Gleefully met again—
Jolly Two Hundred!
Trophies to right of them,
Trophies to left of them,
CARDIGAN'S charger's head,
Piously sundered!
Back they reeled, from the spread,
Straight as they could, to bed—
They that had dined so well—
Nothing to pay per head—
Happy Two Hundred!
When shall their glory fade'(
0, what a meal they made I
Cockneydom wondered.
Honour the Charge they made—
Bravo the Light Brigade!
Hearty Two Hundred!

Since as Lie Tea 'tis known to grocery fame:
But comes the deep momentous question, why
False Tea alone should have the prefix " Lie."
Lie-Wine is found on tables of pretence,
Lie-Agitators mock our common sense,
Lie-Hair is seen on heads of ladies bright,
Lie-bloom to cheeks gives dangerous delight,
Lie-Ten-per-Cent. brings house and land to th' hammer,

Lie-Christian clerics shock the world with curses,
Lie-Coals are slate and brick, Lie-Broadcloth shoddy,
Lie-Whiskey 'd make a Soot abjure his toddy.

Half to exhaust the catalogue of lies:
They flatter in the fine patrician air;
They haunt our shops and workshops, plenteous thire;
E'en when you walk beneath the rainy sky,
Your silk umbrella soon begins to lie.
Wherefore Punch says, whoever may be able
Lie to detect, should give that lie its label:
If this were bravely done, right soon there 'd'be

Are scarcely those that best suit his Showman.

First in the battle, then in the Show.

With the gift of the gab for the hour of need.

And much tall talk is Our Heroes' meed.
'Tis fine to be brave, but better, no doubt,
To be up to the rule of the Hero's Tout.'
What shall we do with Oar Heroes? Nay!
The problem's solved in the prettiest way.
They find their Kudos, at life 's grey close,

THE ART OP NOMENCLATURE.
By Coo NOMEN, ESQ., Prenomen Place, near Agnomen.
THE Art of the Nomenclator has been neglected in these modern
days. There seems good reason for calling attention to its great
importance. A few hints on the subject may lead to its scientific
investigation. Names have a great influence on destiny.
Soys.—Call a boy JOHN, and he will be steady; call him CHAHLES,
and he will deviate into CHARLEY, and go in for flirtation. It is to
be remarked that MESSRS. SMITH, BROWN, and JONES are fond of
christening their sons STANLEY, HOWABD, CLINTON, GBOSVENOB,
though they have no claim to connection with those noble families.
HOWARD SMITH is a queer combination. Why not go to earlier
traditions? As thus:
For the son of a Statesman named SMITH—PEBICLES SMITH.
For the son of a Poet named SMITH—HOMER SMITH.
For the son of a Doctor SMITH—^ESCDLAPIUS SMITH.
For the son of a Soldier SMITH—ACHILLES SMITH.
For the son of a Democrat SMITH—THERSITES KENEALY SMITH.
And so on, to the end of a very long chapter indeed.
Girls,—Difficult. All questions about girls Mr. Punch finds
uncommonly difficult. Would you, pretty reader of this column,
rather be KATE or KEZIA, JESSY or JEMIMA, AMY or AMELIA, LILY
or LUCINDA, SALLY or SOPHONISBA? Ponder this momentous ques-
tion, for upon it depends the opinion of you held by that Arbiter
JPuellarum who dwells at 85, Fleet Street. Mr. Punch likes to give
girls names of poetic form. A famous Poet called his daughter
ROTHA, after the river which flowed beneath Rydal Mount. And
may not fair christenings be found in English poetry? Have not
TOL. LIU. 1
SPENSEB'S Una, and SHAKSPEABE'S Rosalind, and JONSOS'S Earine,
a right to be remembered.?
Streets.—The two chief streets of a certain English city are Wine
and Corn Streets. Good. But the old London names are good also.
Piccadilly may be connected with peccadilloes: Punch can't say.
Pall Mall recalls the pleasant game of ball played by the gayest of
our kings. The Strand was once the shore of Thames; through
Holborn ran the Old Bourne; once there was a gate to commemorate
King Lud. Can't modern folk be similarly commemorated? We
seem to have lost our inventive faculty—all of us, save Mr. Punch,
who means to amaze the City with Punch Buildings, and get Apollo
and half-a-dozen other gods to meet the LOED MAYOR and Aldermen
when the great College of Wit is opened.
Dogs.—Rover, Lion, Neptune, Dash, are among the stupid old
names for dogs which have become stereotyped. Inventive people
have other names. Mr. Punch has his ancient immortal canine
comrade, Toby, who in days to come will be transfigured to the skies
as Cam's Maximus, Cants Major being utterly eclipsed. This, of
course, will be coincident with Punch's own apotheosis, the date
whereof depends very much on the arrangements to be made between
Olympus and No. 85.
Maid-Servants.—Fair LUCILLA ought to have her name legibly
written on her face. POLLY and SALLY and SUKEY materially differ.
But are there any POLLIES and SALLIES and SUKEYS now? Not a bit
of it. Miss MABIANNE comes as Cook, Miss SARA as Housemaid,
Miss SUSANNA as Lady's-Maid—all in the latest fashionable attire.
The mistress who is deciding whether or not to engage them gets
many a wrinkle about the latest fashions from their elegant costume.
THE LARGEST-SIZED TURKEY SPONGE.—The SULTAN.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DINNER.

HE Show was over.
The Procession
had made its tour
of the City and
got to Westmin-
ster, picked up
the Judges, and
returned by way
of the Thames
Embankment.
The City Marshal
had pranced on
his fiery untamed
steed through the
ancient street of
Fleet, and the gilt gingerbread coach
(very full inside) had jolted past the St.
Stephen's Club and the site of the New
National Opera Honse without an acci-
dent. The trumpeters, in jack boots
and velvet caps, had nourished their
loudest flourish, and the principal
guests had been cheered by the other guests, and all was joy, cold viands and hot turtle-soup—thick and clear.
Mr. Punch, having only consented to be present at the Banquet on the understanding that his incognito should be strictly respected,
was seated at one of the lower tables, with a Common Councilman on one side of him, and a gentleman in a Yeomanry uniform-
fearfully and wonderfully made—on the other. He was weary of the talk of his neighbours. The first had given him a tedious
history of all the less noted pumps in the City of London, and the second had shown him (with the aid of some walnuts, a pair of
crackers, and a desert-spoon) now Putney might be saved from the hoof of the ruthless invader, in the event of the Germans taking
Etrne Bay by a coup de main. Mr. Punch listened with the amiable politeness for which he is famed all the world over, and was
turning round to suggest that, perhaps. 85 Fleet Street might be of some service as a rifle-pit (Mr. Punch's military knowledge is
sound, as far as it goes, if limited), when he noticed that, in the place of the warlike Yeoman, was seated a lady of most prepossess-
ing appearance. She was dressed in white, and carried in her hand a small mirror.
"My dear Mr. Punch," she said, smiling, as her neighbour gazed upon her with a broad stare of astonishment, "you are sur-
prised to see me here?"
"Very much indeed," replied Mr. Punch, hluntiy.
"As one of my oldest, dearest, and firmest friends," she continued, "I will tell you why I have come. I want to make the
speakers to-night talk frankly. In my presence they dare not be guilty of deceit. While they are smiling and attempting to conceal
their thoughts, you and I will be listening to the Truth. You know who I am?"
"May I be shot if I do!" replied Mr. Punch, again very bluntly.
"Look at this mirror!" Mr. Punch looked, and saw a very handsome, clever man—it was the reflection of his own face.
I see you have guessed my name now—I am Truth; and for the last thirty-four yean I have been near your desk, to guide your pen
and point your pencil. And here we meet at the LOBD MATCH'S Banquet! What do you think of that P"
••' "That you are out of place^" returned Mr. Punch.
"Quite so. It is the first time I have had anything to do with after-dinner speeches, and very likely it will he the last. But hush!
There is the LOBD MAT OH proposing the health of the QUEEN.
'And very pleasantly did the LORD MAYOR perform the duty. In the presence of Truth he could only praise HER MAJESTY. His
speech indeed would have been perfect had he omitted the last two or three sentences, which seemed to he forced from him against his will:—
"I am very much pleased to be Lord Mayor," said he; "and before my predecessor was out of office I took care to put myself en
Evidence by explaining that, out of respect to MR. ALDERMAN STONE, I could not take part in any public ceremony. The QUEEN is the
fountain of honour, and certain Representatives of Foreign States are still permitted to go to Court. I am sure you will be delighted
to learn that, in future, people admitted to the Palace will not be allowed to dine in the Guild Hall. The Crown I admit is the Fountain
of Honour, but is not the LOBD MAYOR something more—is he not the Chief Cook of Dignity?"
"Really," said Mr. Punch to his neighbour, "I think these remarks very mal d propos."
"I made him say that," replied Truth, with a smile. "But listen to that Distinguished Officer returning thanks for the Army."
Said the Distinguished Officer: "You do not deserve much praise from us. We know perfectly well that you scrutinise every item of
the Army Estimates. Still. I must say something civil, and so I allude to the City Train Bands. I think they must have been, as a
body of men, nearly as useless as the Volunteers. I believe they have a large drill-ground somewhere near Finsbury Circus. I hear
you have been squabbling about it. All I can say is, squabble as much as you please, but don't bother ui with your complaints.
These remarks are local, but I will add one of general interest. Recruiting is still very unsatisfactory. The young men we wish to
draw into the Service consider the Army a disgraceful calling. Under these circumstances, it is most important that we should
treat the livery of Her Majesty with the greatest possible respect; that soldiers should be taught that the red coat is the most honour-
able of costumes. Accordingly, we have ordered two officers to wear their uniforms, as a punishment, for the space of a year; and may,

some day, send all the old tunica, returned into store under the new
regulations, to Pentonville and Dartmoor, to be re-issued as oonvict-
clothing.
"Surely he did not mean to say that!" whispered Mr. Punch.
"I don't think he did," replied Truth; "but I put it into his
mouth. Silence! here come the thanks for the Navy."
An official in a richly embroidered coat was now addressing the
company:—
"The Army is not so popular in this great city as the Navy, for
the simple reason that Commerce requires ships, and not regiments.
Were England invaded, your hearts and pockets would be equally
touched. It is only right therefore to tell you that you have been
wasting millions upon Ironclads that run into one another and sink
on the smallest provocation. You will be consoled to learn, how-
ever, that their loss is of comparative unimportance, as they are out
of date, and have long been unable to perform those duties for
which they were originally constructed. As to that unlucky
Slavery Circular—it wasn't our doing, but those blundering fellows'
at the Foreign Office, and they ought to be made answerable for it.
I speak for my brothers of the Admiralty, and can honestly say
that the Board is a most united one—a perfect happy family.
Vanguards may sink, Mistletoes may be run down, but Patronage
will go on for ever. These are my sentiments, and I think I may
add are the sentiments of every true-hearted sailor and long-headed
civilian who passes his leisure hours in the Admiralty, Whitehall,
near Charing Cross, 8.W."
"Eh," cned Mr. Punch, "surely that is a very painful confes-
sion."
"Great is the power of Truth," replied his fair companion.
"But listen, here comes the speech of the evening."
A well-known Statesman was on his legs.
"In the absence," said he, " of one more worthy to occupy the
place I fill, I return you hollow thanks for those hearty after-dinner
cheers. The traditional policy of a Tory Cabinet is well-known to
all of you. A Conservative Ministry is supposed to be jealous of
the national honour, to be the mouthpiece of all that is good and
stable in the land. Since we have been in power we have found our
Foreign policy laughed to scorn. Turkey no longer looks up to us
as a guide ana authority. Russia does precisely what she pleases.
Considering that the latter country is making great strides towards
our Indian frontier, we can scarcely repeat the ooast that we are an
Asiatic Power of the first magnitude. For all that, we have still a
certain amount of influence on the West Coast 'of Africa. This
influence may fade away, and when it does we doubtless shall be
able to introduce civilisation into New Guinea and the countries
lying adjacent to the North Pole. Thus the power of England will
always be in the ascendant. That we are the mouthpiece of the
People must be very apparent to you. The Nation told us to bring
in a Merchant Shipping Bill, after we had rejected the measure, and
we brought one in. 1'he Nation told us that we had issued a dis-
graceful Circular about Fugitive Slaves, and the disgraceful
Circular was withdrawn. The Nation tells us that we are a mistake,
and we do not say no. Our opinion of one another, on the contrary,
coincides strangely with the opinion of the Nation. However,_here
we are at the Lord Mayor's Dinner, and now is the time for hiding
the truth under a bushel of big words, and smothering plain sense,
as far as we can, with ornamental nonsense."
The applause that followed this strange address was so hearty
that Mr. Punch turned round to Truth to inquire the cause of the
enthusiasm. His fair neighbour had vanished, and in her stead was
the Yeomanry officer.
"You have been snoring, Sir," said the warrior. "We could
scarcely hear that gentleman proposing the toast of the ' Ladies.'"
"And who will return thanks for them? " asked Mr. Punch.
"Perhaps ," and then the Yeoman mentioned the name of a
very great Statesman indeed.
'f Why should he return thanks for the Ladies?" again inquired
Mr. Punch.
He heard the voice of Truth—invisible as she had made herself—
for the last time, " Because, my dear Sir, the Right Honourable
Gentleman is the most egregious old woman they can find in the
Egyptian Hall 1"

I HAVE but few hints left to make on the subject of furnishing.
Already I see an improvement, and I look around me with pride at
the first improvement which I recognise as the genuine results of
my labour, and as so many steps in a right direction. The right
direction being, of course, towards the shops where, by arrangement
with the proprietors, I can choose anything for anybody.
Glass is an important item in furniture: as my old friend HEHK
JOSEPH MiiLLEE observes, "Glass offers matter for reflection."
Glass ceilings are amusing, because you can see yourself>s others
do not see you; i.e. walking on your head.
In drinking-glasses two things alone have to be considered,, quality
and quantity; and these have more to do with what you put into
them, than what you are likely to get out of them.
But a dinner-giver should get a good deal out of glass. New
shapes will be supplied by our Artist, as for instance—

The last shape, in china, would make a handy coffee or tea-cup.
But for designs let inquirers send to me, and 1 shall be happy to
furnish them myself.

pose to conclude for the present a subject which is interesting to all

REVEREND SIB,
IT is with much diffidence I write, having failed to receive
my acknowledgment in any one of the daily journals to which I
lave applied for publication, but I feel there is deep significance
>eneath the motley garments in which you are depicted, and it is
.his which gives me courage to address you.
I am one of those ministering martyrs who believe that the beau-
ies of the soul must be represented to erring sinners by the glory
of the garments we wear.
Are we not told to consider the lilies of the field? Am I not right
-hen in appearing before my congregation in the nearest approach
a imitation of Nature's hues that Art and workmanship can devise?
They toil not, neither do they spin. Therefore I appeal to all my
Christian sisters to devote a portion of the day to albs and dalmatics
:or my use.
Rome decrees that feasts and fasts should have their various
colours. I adore all that issues from Rome, though pecuniary cir-
sumstances prevent me from accepting every sacrifice, and martyrs
lave no right to elude the struggles their conscience has commenced;
put I opine that we should clothe our bodies in the colours which
illustrate the spirit prevailing In us at the time. Thus: Tulips,
yellow and purple, on a red ground—noble pride. Lilies on amber
and gold—purity of purpose. Gardenia on Hue—odour of sanctity.
Would that 1 could persuade my brethren to assist me in this
noble enterprise! Would that all who hear me would be persuaded
that religion is nothing without embroidery; tenets futile without
vestments.
Fools and sceptics point the finger of scorn at me, and say, " Look
after your poor. Cleanse the inside of the platter." My dear
friend, would my congregation be a tithe of what it is, if the eye
were not fed with constant variety of form and colour? _ Every
sister wonders as she takes her seat what my state of soul is going
to be. Shall I wear Tulips on a red dalmatic, or J«nquils on a
silver stole? She sees my vestments, and in them reads her
ministering priest's spiritual mood.
There is much controversy going on in the Press about subjects
which are as nothing compared with this. Several of the sweetest
shades of religious temperament are still unfurnished with their
corresponding robes. I appeal again, through your powerful
columns, to my beloved sisters. May their neeiles point the way
to perfect happiness!
FBANCISCO FABETSEE,
Incumbent of Saint Wistaria.
P.S.—I fear you have no space for an exhaustive exposition of
my faith; indeed, in moments of discouragement, I doubt whether
you will aid the good work by printing my letter. If I see this in

not, Snowdrops and Violets—resignation under advene circumstances.

Yet who at the same time does not feel that, whilst those rogues,
the vendors of bogus titles, deserve imprisonment and hard labour,
those other rogues, but also fools, their customers, the would-be
buyers of distinctions which, if veritable bargains, would be lying
testimonials, deserve at least to lose their money.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
PUNCH TO THE LORD! MAYOR; GREETING

ALVX, my LORD MAYOR I In con-
vivial session,
Punch has seen pass your annual
procession;
The City Marshal, on the worst
of nags,
Leading the City guilds, whose gorgeous flags
Have made the ancient street of Fleet alive,
And caused a joke or two at Eighty-Five,
Whose wit, no great ones, howe'er gorgeous, spares-
Sultans or Shahs, Khedives, Czars, or Mayors.
The gaudy pageant has passed Temple Bar:
Punch stirs his fire and lights a fresh cigar,
And ponders over London. How it grows,
This City flushed with luxuries, vexed with woes!
Is it to be a town, for many a day,
"Where wealth accumulates and men decay "?
Epicure Mammon in BEN JONSON'S time
Had scarcely reached our gorgeous heights sublime:
Now he rides rampant, and his splendid dinners
Have magnetising force for saints and sinners.
Who can resist the haunch, the hot-house pine,
The perfect menu, the long-cellared wine?
The company befits the bill of fare:
You meet Wit, Beauty, Rank, and Fashion there.
A prima donna comes, no singer sweeter:
And Mammon's Rector is right glad to meet her.
And all the while, in many a London hovel,
What mvriads of the dangerous classes grovel I
No hope in this world of less load of care,
No knowledge of a happier world elsewhere.
Philosophy, with scientific lens,
Looks on the inmates of those dreary dens,
Finds that the poor existed long ago,
And smirking says, "It always must be so."
Now, LORD MAYOR COTTON, there's a chance for you;
Tour race has always been both brave and true.
Tour ancient motto,* which in verse won't scan,
Announces you a proper type of man.
The life of fashion, the disdain of fear,
Brought to the front that haughty Cavalier,
WELLINGTON'S friend, the daring COUBERMERE.
Another COTTON, Admiral complete,
In Tagus river seized a Russian fleet.
Earlier, Sis ROBERT, in rare learning dipt,
Collected many a priceless manuscript,
And, with a princely scholar's generous will,
Gave to the people fruit of wealth and skill.
fortuna paratus."—ifotto of. Cotton.
Noblesse oblige.' The claims of such a race
Will make you bolder .in your civic place:
Besides you are a poet. Very odd:
Punch knew it not till he referred to Dod.*
Put poetry in practice, dear LORD MAYOR:
Already you have somewhat cleared the air—
See Punch's last Cartoon in every street-
Drawing the line 'twixt honest man and cheat.
Go on as bravely as you have begun,
And when your year of civic power is done.
Punch will give London's and all England s thanks
To him whose shield bears the three Cotton hanks,
And.hail the falcon in your ancient crest,
The City's scourer of a vermin-pest.
•_".Has written poem*."—Dod, p. 190.
EDUCATION AND CRIME.
MR. PUNCH, SIB,
ALTHOUGH the necessity of living, combined with impa
tience of industry, has compelled me to pursue illicit courses, I am
enabled, by having had the advantage of instruction, to read the
Times, and you. Your contemporary, the other day, published a
report, more interesting than . agreeable, to me at least, on the
"Employment of Convicts." It contains the following particularly
unpleasant suggestion:—
"The chaplain of Pentonville Prison suggests that there should be assigned
to convicts what he calls the unsavoury occupation of diverting sewage from
your rivers, and utilising it for manure."
Diverting sewage, indeed! A high diversion, no doubt, for the
Reverend gentleman, situated to the windward of a member of his
flock engaged in it, to contemplate. An occupation truly unsavoury,
and equally laborious. I cannot but admire the ingenuity of this
aggravation—not to say refinement—of punishment. There is,
however, another service imposed upon gentlemen in seclusion, of
which, regarded as a penal infliction, the annoyance is really refined.
In some of the principal Government Prisons, besides hammocks
made for the Royal Navy and mail-bags for the Post-Office—
"Clothes are made by convicts for the Police."
The pain of being thus obliged unwillingly to work is enhanced
by a sting of studied acuteness craftily envenomed, mental, and
nicely calculated to hurt the feelings. To what toil could a convict
be doomed more bitter than the task of making clothes for the
Police? Only one, Mr. Punch, that—under sentence for robbery
with violence—^f having to manufacture cats-o'-nine-tails.
It is with mingled feelings of approval and apprehension that I
transcribe a passage of a nature slightly personal:—
"It may surprise many to learn from this year's report of the Chaplain of
Dartmoor Prison, that ninety-five of the prisoners have, since their confine-
ment there, studied and made considerable progress in the French, German,
Italian, Spanish, and Latin languages. The Chaplain of Portland Prison
states that some of the educated prisoners are among the most difficult to deal
with, for their superiority in some respects to the general class leads them
to resent the application to themselves of some of the prison rules ; and it has
been found to check the tendency to a morose, sullen, and insubordinate spirit
if a little ambition to revive former studies can be created, or if a man can be
induced to employ himself after the labours of the day are over, in enlarging
lis knowledge by the pursuit of some particular subject."
In the too probable event of my getting into trouble, I trust I
may experience the kindly discipline of Dartmoor, where penal
servitude appears to consist very much in literary occupation.
Should my place of detention be Portland, the difficulty of dealing
with me wiu, I am sure, be much simplified by treating me in the
considerate manner suggested by the Chaplain of that Institution,
making the " labours of the day" as light as possible, and never
subjecting me to the cruel indignity of being_ utilised as a tailor to
;he Police, slavery which I should feel to be infinitely more disgusting
even than employment in the "diversion" of sewage.
With every apology for trespassing on your valuable space, I
remain,

UNION of Equity and Law!
Who such a union ever saw?
Such fusion must confusion mean I
Can no Queen's Proctor intervene,

Being divorced, they can't be married.
This happy union, people say.
Was fitly fixed for All Saints' Day.

Was such a blunder ever known?
Ye who in Hall eat legal dinners,
Is there no feast that s named All Sinners?
Picture the bridal 1 Bridegroom gruff,
Made 9f the very sternest stuff:
No smile o'er that grim visage flits;
His wedding coat is lined with writs.
His honeymoon, no doubt, he fain
Would spend in happy Chancery Lane.
But 0 sweet Equity, the bride!
A creature to be deified—
With perfect justice in her eye,
She cannot cheat, she cannot lie:
Behold her, dressed in virgin white,
An angel of serene delight.
They 're wedded I Wonders never cease:
War in due time will marry Peace;
To seek a husband Truth will range,
And find him on the Stock Exchange;
Religion, jilting Controversy—
Her follower long—will wed with Meroy.
When Law and Equity receive
Their guests, one hardly can believe
That ho, of tyrants quite the sternest,
Will take her counsel in good earnest.
But Punch the union won't disparage,
And drinks their long and happy marriage.
MOURNING AND GRIEF.
As a Reformer, MB. GLADSTONE is a little behind MR. BRIGHT
with regard to a social question whereon the latter statesman is
thorough. Hear our WILLIAM, however, on "Funeral Reform."
He thus answers a Correspondent :—
"Iltiwardcn, Oct. 29, 1875.
"SIR,—I thank you for your communication, and, though unable to concur
with you in the opinion that the wearing of mourning ought to be abandoned,
I concur iii much that you hare said, and think the whole subject requires to
be gravely considered by this country.
"Tour faithful servant,
"W. E. GLADSTONE."
Will not WILLIAM, on further reflection, Bee that mourning might
be advantageously abandoned by influential and independent parties
who can afford the expense of it, for the relief of those who cannot,
and at the same time cannot afford to ignore MBS. GRT/NDY.?
"Mourning" always aggravates grief, unless the mourners are
wealthy, or ladies whom it becomes. It is especially grievous when
it has to be worn by survivors for a relation who has left them no
money. The whole subject of the haberdashery pertaining to
funerals requires, as MR. GLADSTONE says, to be gravely considered.
Levity in the consideration of a subject so grave strikes us as
unbecoming. Is our WILLIAM also among the punsters f

DARWIN UP AND DOWN.
PBOFESSOB MTVABT, the other evening, at the Leeds Philosophical
and Literary Society, delivered an instructive lecture on the subject
of ourselves and "our poor relations." Speaking of development
and evolution, he pointed out that the animal kingdom presents
"certain exceptions to this ascending change." Amongst reptiles
and some shell-fish, indeed, "there had been a process of degrada-
tion rather than of advancement," especially observable in the
lobster and shrimp group. He might have added the oyster—
except, indeed, as regards price, in which there has been an advance-
ment too rapid and too hign to be pleasant.
"Of late, however, there had been a tendency to extend the zoological
area orer which degradation was supposed to have taken place. If this view
met with acceptance, it was difficult to see where it was to stop; indeed, it
might bring our ape friends again before us in a new light, for hereafter some
one might profess to find in them not the rude ancestors, but the degraded
descendants, of early man."
QHereat there was, of course, "a laugh." It is much better fun
to'imagine that other people, once on a parity with our ancestors,
degenerated from humanity into apehood, than to suppose that we
are the descendants of apes. Britons also may complacently regard
much in the manners, customs, and conduct—including, they con-
sider, numerous monkeys' tricks—of foreign nations as indicating a
process of undevelopment still going on amongst some of our neigh-
bours. As for ourselves, however, let us confidently hope—if we
cannot exactly assert—that a daily increasing height of moral aim,
and preference of _the sublime and beautiful to the ignoble and
the grotesque in literature and art, demonstrate ns manifestly to
be on the rise, and tending, not downwards towards the Ape, but
(with ME. DISBAELI) upwards to the Angel.
« RETIRE YOUR MEN, SIR!"
THE premature publication of the proposed Army Retirement
scheme in the London papers having caused much confusion in
military circles, Mr, Punch thinks it right to issue apian of his
own, founded upon precedents that have been for years recognised
both in the War Office and at the Horse Guards.
RETIREMENT.
W, O. Circular, 01,423. Horse Guardt, Nov. 5, 1875.
In future, Buglers will be kept on the strength of their regiments
for two years. At the end of that time, if they are found to be
efficient, they will be discharged, unless (in the interim) they have
been promoted to the rank of Sergeant-Majors unattached. If a
Bugler at the end of two years' service is found incapable of sound-
ing a single call, he will be kept on the strength of his regiment for
a further term of two years. After he has completed four years'
service, however, he will be compulsorily retired on a pension of
five pence a day, or a lump sum of £l 3s. l^d.
Subalterns, having learned their drill, will be compulsorily retired,
to make room for subalterns who have still their drill to learn.
Captains who have passed the Staff College will be offered a brevet
step and 5s. a day. Commutation, £150.
Majors having completed twenty years' service will be ordered to
retire on the uniform of a Lieutenant-Colonel and £135 a year. On
availing themselves of the privilege of wearing " mufti," they will
be deprived of their pensions.
Lieutenant-Colonels with twenty-five years' service (fifteen of
which have been spent before the enemy) will be ordered to give up
their commands, to make room for untried men. Lieutenant-
Colonels so retired will have the right to wear their medals, clasps,
and other decorations, at flower shows, agricultural meetings, and
private evening parties.
Generals, Field-Marshals, and offioers of all ranks who have
reached the age of seventy-five, will not be called upon to retire,
but will remain in the posts they occupied prior to the Abolition of
the purchase system, until severally recommended for further
promotion.

A PROCLAMATION!
COTTON, LOED MAYOR.
BE it known, once for all and to all, that from and after the date
of this current number of Punch, any joke, jest, gibe, pun, quip,
crank, or waggery, offered as a voluntary contribution, and fondly
intended for publication, answering to the description hereinafter
contained, will be treated in the manner hereunaer set forth, any
statute, ordinance, institute, enactment, or encouragement and
approbation of deluded and deluding fathers, mothers, brothers,
sisters, wives, sweethearts, and friends to the contrary notwith-
standing.
Any written communication, designed for a joke on Threadneedle
Street, in connection with the surname of the LOBD MAYOK, will he
instantly torn into ten thousand (more or less) fragments.
Any contribution which, on being opened by one of Mr. Punch's
private secretaries, shall disclose at the first glance such expressions
or phrases as "cotton to" "dropping the thread of his discourse,"
"winding his way," "wound up his speech," and the like, will,
without a moment's hesitation or delay, be thrown contnmekonsly
into the waste-paper basket.
Any piece of paper bearing on its surface, in characters inscribed
either in ink or pencil, a suggestion to the effect that the LOBD
MAYOR, on those public occasions when he has to return numerous
salutations, will have to go through a great deal of bowing and
bobbin', will be forthwith flung contemptuously into the office
grate.
Any note, letter, or other missive, whether with or without an
envelope, proposing that, for the year 1875-6, the name of Cottono-
polis should be transferred from the City of Manchester to the City
of London, will he twisted up into the form and shape of a spill, and
used as an instrument for lighting a pipe or kindling a cigar.
Any person being so misguided as to allude to the possibility of
the LOBD MATOB giving a Cotton Ball, and plunging still deeper
into crime by associating reels with an entertainment of this de-
scription, will, if he can be traced, be handed over to the 'proper
authorities, to be dealt with as the Supreme Court of Judicature
may direct.
And, generally, any correspondence which may have for its object
the establishment of a playful connection between a soft white
vegetable substance, largely imported into this country from
America and India, and the name of the LORD MATOB, will be
zealously guarded from all other eyes but those of the butterman
and his customers.

in its main purport—the discouragement of unseemly jesting on the
names of great civic dignitaries and the diminution of Mr. Punch's
correspondence—to MB. ALDERMAN and SHEBIFF KNIGHT. It seems
hardly possible that the most disordered imagination, the most per-
verted ingenuity, can extract any material for its nefarious practices
from the name of MB. SHERIFF BREFFITT: but time and the post
will show. Mr. Punch knows only too well what human nature is

CURSING AND SWEAEING.
WE know that good Society has now for some time relinquished the bad
habit of cursing and swearing. So, SIR GEORGE BowYEK maintains, has the
Roman Catholic Church—although he cannot deny that, at one time, it cursed
as terribly as ever the British Protestant troops swore in Flanders. On All
Saints' Day the Defender of the Ultramontane Faith appropriately communi-
cated the following explanation to the Times .—
"Sir,—In answer to your Correspondents of to-day, I will only Bay that I did not assert
that curses bad been never used in the Culmination of excommunications. But I assert
that curses are no essential part of excommunication, for it is denned by the Canonists
limply as a comtnunione excltuio."
Just BO. Curses, in excommunication, as well as in common talk, are
unnecessary. Excommunication, in its ultimate effect, means all that can be
expressed in the strongest language. Going into detail from the crown of the
head to the sole of the foot, with a special malison on each of the intervening
organs, is simply superfluous. Ecclesiastics, like other gentlemen, have dis-
continued the use of vulgar expletives. It is now only the coarser portion of
the populace who are accustomed to utter imprecations on the organs of sight,
the circulating fluid, and the members of those who displease them. The
declaration added to the foregoing statement will perhaps he frankly accepted
by Ma. NEWDEOATE, or even by MB. WHALLEY himself :—
"I assert that those old forms are either abrogated or obsolete. Our present POPB
repealed a great number of old excommunications, and, among others, the Bull of POPB
CLEMENT excommunicating Protestants."
Had not this Bull, however, practically repealed
itself? What was the use of a Bull to excommunicate
persons who were never in communion? A Pontifical
Bull which had come to be as it were a capital sentence
on dead men had surely degenerated into a Bull of the
Irish species.
However, it is some news to hear from SIB GEORGE
BOWTEB that the POPE has repealed Bulls. If present
Infallibility can allow itself to repeal bygone Infalli-
bility's Bulls, there is no saying to what rational con-
clusions future Infallibility, guided by Common Sense,
may not one of these days find it possible to arrive. In
the meanwhile, let us allow all due weight to the assur-
ance that, in the fnlmination of excommunications,"
unparliamentary language is now unusual, if not nn-
canonioal.

GLADSTONE'S CLARET."
LORD MAYOR'S DAY AS IT MIGHT BE.
(Extracted by Clairvoyance from the City Chronicle, A.D. 1975.)
WE often hear remarks about the wisdom of our ancestors, yet we
are not seldom filled with pity when we patiently reflect upon the
follies of our forefathers, such, for instance, as they perpetrated in
their foolish Lord Mayor's Show. How vast is the improvement
since a hundred years ago! Who would ever dream now of stopping
for some hours the whole traffic of the City, that stupid simpletons
might stare at a stupid, senseless show? And who would dream of
sitting squeezed and sweltering at what was called a "banquet,"
where, after scrambling for some soup and a slice of lukewarm
mutton (christened "venison" in the menu), you were doomed to
sit half-stilled and to listen to dull speeches which you vainly tried
to oatoh?
But, now that women have their rights, and the Lady Mayoress
reigns as Empress of the City, how much altered for the better are
our old Civic ceremonials, since they have been confided to the care
of the fair sex! In lieu of gingerbread state coaches, and men in
pasteboard 'armour, and tawdry flags and trappings, which of old
were suffered to impede the traffic or the City, and attracted crowds
of idlers to be plundered by the pickpockets and pommelled by the
roughs,—in place of this tomfoolery which was termed the Lord
Mayor's show, what is it that now constitutes the principal attrac-
tion of our Lady Mayoress's Day? Let us briefly chronicle a part
of what occurs.
The happy day is welcomed by a peal of merry laughter from the
mouths of the Bow belles, who attend as maids in waiting on the
Lady Mayoress, and are all a-Gog (and Magog) for the Show. They
proceed to deck her Ladyship in her official robes, and scatter roses
in her path as she proceeds to the Guild Hall. Here the Show of
Civic Beauty is annually held, and the prettiest girls in London are
arranged for exhibition, previous to their reception and appearance
at the Ball. On the entrance of her Ladyship, the band strikes up
"See the Conquering Charmer Comes.'" and the young ladies all
drop curtseys, and present bouquets. In order to prevent blushes,
as well as scrambles for admission, the Show is strictly private, and
no unmarried reporter is permitted to intrude.
To satisfy the Public, a few photographs, however, are suffered to
be taken, and these are sold by auction, and the various civic chari-
ties share the proceeds of the sale.
After the Show, the Lady Mayoress entertains the fair assemblage
at an elegant repast of sugarplums and sweeties, whereat their
partners are by courtesy invited to assist, on production of certifi-
cates (signed by a Court Dancing-Master) that they are chatty in
square dances, as well as active and untiring in a galop or a value.
None but known good dancers are suffered to obtain an entrance to
the ball-room, and all chaperones and wallflowers are most rigidly

THE INPALLIBLE^TRUTH.
"WHAT is Truth?" asked PILATE,—
Bat that he asked in vain.
"0! what Truth is," says MANNING,
"I can soon make plain."
"Truth is this—this only—
The one Infallible Church;
Doubt, and at Day of Judgment
You '11 find you 're in the lurch."
"Achf ist das so?" says BISMABCK.
"Tour notion is not mine."
"Ten times accursed," cries MANNING;
Says BISMAKCK, bravely, "Nein!"
LOKD REDESDALE says, " Inform me,
And you '11 oblige me much:
What thing can be Infallible
That does not'act as such'?"
Says MANNING: "My good gracious!
You beg the question quite.
Can't you—or won't you—understand?
Whatever's right is Eight!
"A Church divinely founded—
Is this not clear to you ?—
Cannot but apt divinely,
Whatever it may do.
"I hope that proposition
Has set your mind at rest?"
Says REDESDALE, very sharply,
"If it has, I am—blest!"
Powerful Peacemakers.
THE Paris Correspondent of the Pall Mall Gazette, the other day
ielegraphed as follows :—
'There are rumours to-day of a Russian Circular inviting the Powers
ignataries to the Treaty of Paris to a pacific intervention in the affairs of
Turkey."
If the Russian Circular were a Circular Ironclad, a summons from
uoh a pacificator, to judge by MK. REED'S account of it, would
>erhaps command attention.
Suggested Epitaph

DEATH was our end, that end was great,

Aristocracy and Ale.
THE Hampshire Independent contains a statement that MB. BASS
as declined a Peerage. If this is true, it shows the distinguished
Jrewer to be a supporter of whom the Government thinks no small
eer; and the House of Lords has failed of a reinforcement by one
lore able man of business. It is whispered that the title destined
or the Honourable Gentleman was that of the "EABL or BUKTOH.'I

IN consequence of a recent decision of the Lords of the Admiralty,
distinguished sailor-officer will probably for the future change bis
ame from TABLETON to TAR-LET-OFF.

BURIAL IN BEDS.
WE must not believe all the world says; but the Christian World
at least should speak the truth; and, if it does, the Established
Church appears to be in danger of losing a valuable Clergyman.
The REV. HABBY HOCKEN, ^Tioar of Cople, Bedfordshire, is, the
Christian World says, "a fanatical member of the Ritualistic
School." Ritualism is not commonly combined with logic; and
the Ritualists who secede to Popery are exceptions. But—still
if we may credit the Christian World—the Vicar of Cople has
lately delivered himself of utterances sadly suggestive of the fear
that his Ritualism is too essentially Papistical to allow the hope
that he can continue much longer to hold his Protestant vicarage.
The late Archidiaconal Conference at Bedford included a debate
on MB. OSBOBNE MOBGAN'S Burial Bill. In this controversy MB.
HOCKEN took part; and some of his remarks are quoted by the
Christian World. They were directed principally against the REV.
HUGH BLAGG SMYTH, Rector of Houghton, a previous speaker, who,
in moving an unsuccessful Amendment to a Resolution denouncing
the proposed measure of concession to Dissenters, "had delivered a
speech admirable for its kind Christian feeling and statesmanlike
moderation; but it seemed to have almost a maddening effect on
MB. HOCKEN." Transcribed from out the text of the Christian
World, and with only the needful grammatical changes, set simply
together in the first person, the selections from the speech ascribed
to that Reverend Gentleman may be read as under; it being pre-
mised that the name of " MB. HUGH BLAOG SMYTH," was "repeated
contemptuously" by him " at least a score of times:"—
"I wonder how MR. BLAOG SMYTH could dare BO'dreadfully to violate his
holy orders by introducing a motion so contrary to his profession
I am horn tied at the thought that this MR. HUOH BLAOO SMYTH can be a
parish priest. . . . Some ladies with whom I lunched . . . also expressed tbeir
horror at MB. HUGH BLAGO SMYTH being now a priest in the Church of
England I must enter my protest against this horrible amendment,
which is so dreadfully discreditable to holy orders. . . . Such a horrible
amendment would be a curse to the Church of England; and I should not
be surprised if MR. HUGH BLAOO SMYTH, who would thus shake hands with
the Dissenters, would not hesitate to shake hands with that horrible man
who introduced that measure into Parliament, MR. OSBORNE MORGAN."
Does it not strike the reader how extremely the foregoing invec-
tive resembles that which his Holiness the POPE is accustomed to
hurl at parties who have incurred his animosity? Only the Holy
Father never abuses anybody by name. He always limits himself
to vilifying the object of wrath by implication, or else under a pseu-
donym, calling him, for example, HEROD, or JUDAS, or PONTIUS
PILATE. If MB. HOCKEN did really blackguard MB. HUGH BLAGO
SMYTH as above, he will probably learn how to talk as a " temperate
controversialist," and curse in due canonical form, very soon.
Moreover, not only does he scold in a Papal style, but, in denouncing
a Clergyman for shaking hands with Dissenters by concession as to
the Burial Bill, he expresses an exclusiveness founded on ideas of
the effect of consecration on churchyards, quite special to Romanism.
Let us hope, however, that he has been misreported, and that the
Church of which he is an ornament need not hopelessly make up her
mind to lose him.

THE PRINCE'S VISIT TO INDIA.
(Our Own Representative at Bombay, and all over the place.)
DEAR, VEBT DEAB SIR,
HEBE 's local colour for you! Here we are again! I send you a picture
—a mere sketch—" a poor thins,', Sir, but mine own," which I knocked off on
the spot. Isn't there about it a life and a go—quite a man-go—(ha! ha I
Indian joke too!)—which is raoy of the soil ?—Yes, you won't see many illustra-
tions so up to the time of day as this.

THE INDIAN VISIT.
MB. BLANK CALLING AND QIVIXQ CARD TO "THE BUTLER."
The Ayah (knowing he wishes to see the Daughter of the House). "MASTER CAN'T
8KB MlSSBE. MlBBEB IN BATH-TcB, BATTTM THB MANGO FiSUIT, SAB."
Of course I do not say who the Gentleman with his back to the audience is.
No. Pine man, isn 't he? But delicacy forbids to make any remark behind a
Gentleman's back, which I would not make to his face. I mean before his face.
Look.at my puggaree! Look at the umbrella! There's Local Colouring, my
boy 1 When I told the story—which this cut illustrates—to the gallant ——th,
at mess, they yelled and shouted. It went immensely. Of course I imitated
the native dialect, which I can do to admiration, so if the picture seems to go a
little flat, try reading the words underneath out loud. I need hardly say that
directly a certain Exalted Personage, in whose company I happen to pass most
of my time just now, heard it, he clapped me on the shoulder, and exclaimed,
'' By jove, BILLY, it's the best thing I 've heard for years! It's a side-splitter!
It's a screamer! Send it to Punch."
rSo, Sir, it is at his wish I have forwarded this now invaluable sketch to you.
Treasure it, cherish it, prize it, for England's Royalty has laughed at it,
England's Hope and Star of India has approved of it, and what more can you
want?
We had an interesting Masonic ceremony at Bombay. We laid a stone:
pretty sight! You should have seen me with my orders, sashes, buckles,
sword, and apron, with a trowel in my hand, and H.R.H. leaning gracefully
on my shoulder, haranguing the assembled Brethren, I prompting him.
"Brothers," said he, "when I come to this foreign shore, which is my own
home, I feel that whether the sun is in the East, the moon in the West, or the
stars are shining bright, there is but one sense of universal Brotherhood, which
we experience in following the commands of our Great Master HIBAMABIFF.
(Masonic applause.) Brothers, let us make the signs secretly to one another
(here all made signs secretly to one another), and let each place his hand on his
heart, and in the presence of the two elder Pillars of
Brotherhood. BROTHERS JACHHT and BOAZ, let us pro-
nounce the Shibboleth of the password; and giving the
grip in the third degree (here every one gave the grip in the
third degree,, a most touching sight), let us say, with one
voice, 'Fidelity, Fidelity, Fidelity!'"
JHytelf. So mote it be.
Then the Masonic hymn was sung :—
0, Masons all, with one accord,
Sing out with tuneful fire,
And praise the great KING SOLOMON,
And HIRAM King of Tyre.
Let Indian Brothers hymn the strain,
O'er mountains, hills, and dales,
And after SOLOMON and HIHAMS twain,
God bless the PBINCE OF WALES!
You '11 observe that the third line in the second stanza
is a trifle out, but it exactly suits the tune which has
here a florid passage. The chorus was repeated enthusi-
astically. The author was called for, then the composer.
Need I say that representing both, I stepped forward and
bowed my acknowledgments. This was one of the first
and biggest successes of the Prince's tour as far as we've
gone.
On Tuesday last we saw a Nautch dance in a Chu-
prassee, and walked round a Cummerbund. After this
we returned to our Bheiree, where we partook of Aukoos
and a Hackery (iced). Before retiring for the night, we
smoked a mild Jemadar, and had a short conversation
with a native Chunam, played three games of Chowne
(at which I politely and loyally came off second best.
H.R.H. is so pleased, even if its only half a Gongwala on
the rub—he does like winning)—and then turned in,
Yours ever,
YOUR OWN INDIAN REPRESENTATIVE.
Foot-NoU by the Editor.—Once more we have our doubts.
On referring to an Indian dictionary we find that a Chupratiee ia
1 an upper servant;" a Cummerbund is "a waistcloth;" a
Bheiree is "a long-winged hawk; " Aukoof " a goad for driving
elephants; " Hackery (which he says he drank iced), "a cart;"
Jemadar (which he represents himself as smoking) is "a Sepoy
sergeant J Chunam (with whom he says he held a conversation)
is "a cement made of shells;" Chowrie (which he speaks of as
a game at cards) is " a fly-flapper formed of the tail of a Thibet
cow;" and the Gongwala (which he mentions as a coin) ia '• a
villager." Either Our Correspondent is incorrect, or a new
Anglo-Indian dictionary is a want which should be speedily
supplied. But we have our suspicions.
PYROTECHNICS AT THE PYBAMIDS.
An Allegory on the Banks of the Nile,
"After dinner came the event of the evening—the illumination
of the Great Pyramid . . . First Bengal fires, placed at short
intervals round the Pyramid, were lighted, and each stone
shone out as clear as day. Rocket*, Roman Candles, and other
more complicated feux d'artifice, tilled the air with many colours.
Then lights of all imaginable colours, which had been placed on
every course of stone, and up each angle of the Pyramid, were so
simultaneously lit that the blaze seemed to run up the vast mass,
and, in a moment, enveloped it in one great blaze of variegated
fire, while magnesium wire shone out bright and clear from the
apex. Every sort of firework crackled and blazed and made
cascades of coloured stars in the heavens. . . . Soon all was
grey and cold again, and the lonely, sad-eyed Sphinx was left
behind in the gloom."—Time},
Father Nile. Are there no Gods in Egypt? Hath'the
S[jhinx
No voice to startle these mad fools?
Sphinx. Methinks
K'en Memnon might find utterance! 'Tis a crisis
To move hia lips to murmuring. Though, by Isis,
Silenoe is sweetest!
Father Nik. Silence never more
Shall haunt thy spreading sands, my reedy shore.
The West overwhelms us I
Sphinx. Could not Horus bid
These blatant Britons spare the Pyramid,
Leave the lone Sphinx m happy, haughty scorn
Of the false fires of Sydenham and Cremorne:
Nor shame old Egypt's night—the vulgar Van-
dals!-

With flare of rockets, squibs, and Roman candles,

Of white-faced wanderers and their Prince clap hands
At the poses plastiques of Ghawazee bands;
Sleep at Gesireh, dine at fair Abdeen,
And wake Nile's echoes with " God save the Queen!"

Are all the theme of princely perorations;
And Egypt's rulers stoop to hob-a-nob

To greet a Mushroom Monarch from the West.

Methinks I sight. When Memnon's song no more
Salutes the morning, all that is shall pass
Like a swift scene from a Magician's glass—
That hour must be at hand.
Some snares at least
Beset the path of England in the East.
Bondholders fume, the watchful Bear creeps near,
The Lion's growl wakes not the ancient fear.
The word seems passed,—the hope may prove forlorn,—
Play off the Nile against the Golden Horn.
Time may avenge us yet, Fate fronts the West!
Let us await, in silence,—as is best!
"BOTTOM, THOU ART TRANSLATED."

Lr returning thanks for the Navy, MH. WASD HUMT said :—
"It is with great pleasure that I rise on behalf of so popular a
branch of the English Service as the Navy; and it is with greater
pleasure that I am able to inform you that never in the whole course
of its history was the Navy in such a gloriously perfect condition
as it is now. (Cheers.) There have, I know, been some blunders
and accidents lately. But what of that? In spite of the sneers
of the Liberal Press, I prefer to look on the bright side of things.
(Cheers.) _ The Blunderer and the Incapable came, as you well know,
into collision the other day. I am very sorry that both sank, and
eight hundred men were drowned. But does no gleam of hope
shine out from that accident P I am certain there does. It proves
that we possess magnificent vessels. What is a ram for, if it is
not to run down a shipp (Cheers.) Then you remember in our
torpedo experiments the other day we blew np four new gun-boats.
Ought we not to feel proud and happy that our engineers are capable
of constructing such deadly instruments of warfare? (Cheers.)
Suppose those gun-boats had been the vessels of an enemy, would
their destruction not have been a glorious triumph P (Cheers.)
At the present moment there are no less than half a dozen of Her
Majesty's ships aground in different parts of the globe. The mere
mention of such facts is sufficient to prove, that despite the asser-
tions of libellers, the British Navy is still distinguished for the
intrepidity, for the exploring zeal, for the seamanship of its officers
and men. (Cheers.) In conclusion, I will relate to you a con-
versation I had with the PKKMJ KII this afternoon. He said to me,


in that epigrammatic manner of which he is so great a master
(laughter), 'HUNT, the countr
must go I'
said
things; and I cannot help thinking it will be a good day tor
the English Navy when I resign my office." (Loud and prolonged
cheering.)
THE RIVAL OPTIMISTS.
(JOHN'S Judgment on certain Speeehifyinyt at tht Mansion Saute Dinner.)
"To one or two of these vessels accidents had recently happened, but to
whom waa blame for these accident* to be attached? Surely not to any man,
but rather to the action of the elements."—The LOBD MA YOB at tht Mansion
Sou<e Dinner.
"We only recently lost one of the finest of Her Majesty's ships. I prefer,
however, to dwell with you, my LORD MAYOR, on the bright features of that
unfortunate event."—Ma. WABJ> HUNT, on tht tame occation.
ATS JoHW, "It
would seem
I 've been
having a
dream,
A nightmare in
fact I may
term it;
Some poet de-
clares things
are not what
they seem—
And Man-
sion House
speeches con-
firm it.
I had fancied, of
late, in my
Nautical
State
There was something remarkably rotten;
But' everything's fair, if it isn't first-rate,'
Is the verdict of HUNT and of Conos.
"I must say the view is decidedly new;
These Sages who spot the 'bright features'
In all the big blunders we 've made on the bine,
Must be the most keen-sighted creatures.
For these blunders, they say, do these Optimists gay,
There is no one to blame but—the weather!
That settles the thing in a very neat way.
But does not end my doubts altogether.!
"If my ships cannot steer when the weather is queer,
And are equal to nought but plain sailing;
With the advent of Iron-plads, ugly as dear,
Old seamanship surely is failing.
My old wooden walls were not frightened at squalls,
And had lubbership courted disaster,
JACK had found ' consolation'—what COTTON so calls—
But a pitiful sort of a plaister.
"Though my vessels, I see, must decidedly be
Well adapted for sinking each other,
That fact does not perfectly satisfy me,
Or suffice my misgivings to smother. _
If, handled aright, they sank foes in fair fight,
It might be a matter for merriment;
But this mutual method of proving their might
Is a somewhat expensive experiment.
"Very fine to pooh-pooh just a blunder or two,
And lay stress on some fanciful far gain;
To rejoice that in losing our ships as we do,
We lose not our men in the bargain!
What such Oracle saith is mere wasting of breath.
While around my own shores matters wrong go,
I am scarcely consoled by brave GOODENOCQH s death,
Or some bush-whacking feats on the Congo.
"No; your yarn of excuse is decidedly loose,
Most hopeful First Lord of the Navy.
These pleas </' la Pangloss are worse than no use;
There's a vast deal more pluck in ' Peccaei.'
Perhaps I am dense, but your line of defence,
In my judgment, could scarcely be thinner
And your words won't go down with one Bi\tou of sense,
Save perhaps at a Mansion House Dinner!,"

HOT CODLINS AT THE CAPE.
THE South African Mail publishes some particulars of intelligence
which, if of a political character, nevertheless wears a dramatic
aspect:—
"MB. MF.KHIMAN has visited Dordrecht, but was coldly received. At the
conclusion of the meeting of his constituents, there was something like a repe-
tition of the back-door scene."
Doesn't this look as if MB. MEBRIMAN had, in professional motley,
been playing Member of Parliament, though to unappreciative
spectatorsP Yet the "repetition of the back-door scene" seems
something rather like success. In his performance of that scene
one can imagine that Ms. MEBBIMAN introduced the red-hot poker.
MB. MERRIMAN, we are further told, addressed his constituents :—
"In a Ion; speech he defended the action of the Ministry, and denounced
the Conference as of no advantage to the colony, and wished it no success."
An appropriate form of wish for a MB. MEIUUMAN.
"When he had finished, he intimated that he would answer any questions.
MR. H. HUTCHONS asked whether he would vole for the Conference—yes or
no. He avoided a direct answer ; whereupon MR. HDTCHONS denounced him
as not representing the opinions of Dordrecht, and moved a vote of want of
confidence. Two milder votes were proposed, but lost; and the vote of want
of confidence was carried by a large majority."
All this hag a very pantomimic appearance; but the sequel is
exactly the sort of business with which Christmas has rendered
playgoers familiar:—
"A Gentleman who attempted to support MB. MBRBIHA.N was charged
with being a turncoat. His excitement caused him to rush to the speaker to
explain; and the audience, thinking he had other intentions, interposed. In
the confusion that thus ensued, Al u. MKHHIMAN slipped out at the side-door
into the Magistrate's office. The meeting closed with cheers for federation."
So the shindy ended. ME. MKKKIMAN really seems to have per-
formed very well; and his want of success appears to have been
quite undeserved. Although indifferently received at Dordrecht,
he would very possibly find favour on the London boards, where he
might count upon being duly supported by an efficient Harlequin,
Columbine, and Pantaloon. If, therefore, he has failed at the Cape,
he will perhaps do well to try his luck in the Mother Country.

THE EMPEHOB OF RUSSIA, as Managing Director of the above
Company, has much pleasure in informing the World in general,
and the European Public in particular, that he is making arrange-
ments to establish a Branch of his business in Constantinople.
When this has been accomplished, he will take over the Bankrupt
Stock of the present SULTAN OF TUKKET, at a valuation hereafter to
be agreed upon.
On the establishment of the Branch at Constantinople, a great
increase of Trade may be expected with the East, and negotiations
will be immediately commenced, with a view to acquiring the right
of opening fresh Branches in India, China, and the Australian
Colonies.
Preparations are now being made to buy the good-will and
fixtures of the Britisb nation, on terms exceedingly favourable to
the interests of the Managing Director. After this has been done,
the Company will at once commence operations.
No Shares will be allotted.
N.B.—The only contract affecting the new Company is a treaty
signed by the EMPKKOB OF RUSSIA on the one hand, and Lby the
EHPKROKS OF GEKMANT AND AUSTRIA on the other.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE STORY OF THE SERAPIS.
(A Thousand and Second Arabian Night.)
E read in the
Sahar Danush (or
Garden of Know-
ledge) that there
was in modern
times a Prince of
a goodly presence,
and with a kindly
disposition, who
was also fond of
travel. And this
• Prince, having
voyaged through-
out the length and
breadth of Europe,
desired to journey
to the country of
India, which was an
empire belonging
to the QUEEN, his mother. And he consulted a great statesman, one Bus
Dis HAEI.I, upon the subject. And BUN, knowing that the Prince, the son of
his Royal Mistress, had been to St. Petersburg, and to Paris, and to Cairo, and
to Margate, and to other distant places, was pleased with the idea, and said
unto himself, "This visit to India will be as a robe of honour to myself.
"When the great day of feasting arrives in the City, and the LOBD MAYOB
proposes my health, I shall be able to say this is a great day for England. No
one can doubt that the visit will be rife with consequences of importance both
to India and to England." And so BEIT rejoiced greatly, and promised to
bring the matter before the Council of the Kingdom. And the story of the
bringing of the matter before the Council of the Kingdom is recorded in the
pages of H ANS \HD. And when BEN had named a sum to be used for the purchase
of presents for the Princes of the East, there were those who puffed out their
cheeks and snapped their fingers, saying, " Bah! This sum is not enough for
the purchase of white elephants and jewelled swords and gifts of gold and
silver!" But BEN replied: "I know a place where white elephants and
jewelled swords and gilts of gold and silver can be purchased for a moderate
sum." And they wondered greatly, and questioned him as to the name of the
place. And BEN replied: "The name of the place is Birmingham." And
after this answer they who had puffed out their cheeks and had snapped
their fingers held their peace and were heard no more.
And it was arranged that the Prince should travel in a ship propelled by
steam. This ship was to meet him at a certain port called Brindisi, and was
then to carry him to Bombay. And certain of the Lords of the Admiralty
looked round, about them to find a vessel proper for the purpose. And they
selected a troop-ship called the Serapis. And the Serapisvras to be accompanied
by a 'squadron of iron-dads. And when it was related that the Iron-olads
were to accompany the Serapis, some of the people marvelled greatly, and said,
"Surely these Iron-clads would be safer at anchor off Herne Bay." And
others said, " The Lords of the Admiralty have decided wisely. The Iron-clads
will serve as diving-bells, if peradventure the Prince should wish to examine
the bottom of the sea. Do we not know that the voyage is to be a luxurious
oneP"
So the Serapis was turned inside out. The after part was converted into
dining-rooms and drawing-rooms and bed-rooms and bath-rooms. And the
chairs were of costly leather, and the windows were glazed with the best plate
glass. And the Serapis was painted white, with a broad gold line. And part
of the deck was made into a practising ground for the Prince's horses. And
when it was rough, the horses taking exercise on the practising ground had
a pleasant time of it.
And when it was time for the Serapis to start, the Purser beat his breast with
his hands, and gave way to great lamentation. And it was asked of the Purser
what was the matter. And he replied: "Lo. we have everything of the best
on board. "We have goodly meats and excellent seasonings, and a cow, and
claret and sherry and champagne in magnums and quarts. But, alas! we have
not champagne in pints, and therefore do I beat my breast with both hands
and give way to great lamentation." And those who listened ran quickly to the
shore and visited the merchants of wine, and returned to the Serapis, bearing
with them large hampers. And, when the hampers were opened, behold there
were dozens and dozens of champagne in pints. And, when the Purser saw the
bottles, his brow cleared and he smiled, and his countenance was like unto the
bulbul singing in the fig-trees of Bagdad.
And now the Serapis was ready to start, and the Captain (who was new to
the ship) gave the order to let go. And there was great noise and much blowing-
off of steam and little more besides. The Serapis moved as the omnibus moves
in mid-day in Fleet Street, as the turtle moves on the shores of the Pacific.
And the Lords of the Admiralty bowed their heads, and said, "Lo, we have
remembered everything save one thing—and that thing the engines." And
there was much patching up and alteration, and at last the Serapis started for
Brindisi.
And the Lords of the Admiralty were greatly troubled in their minds
about the engines of the Serapis, and they ordered and commanded a great
official to meet the vessel at a distant port, so that he
might see to the machinery. And the great official
started for the distant port. In the meantime, the
Serapis had taken a smaller official on board, who had
cured the engines of their vices, so that the travelling
of the ship through the water was like unto the bound-
ing of the antelope from the arrow of the pursuer. And
when the great official found this to be the case, he obeyed
the instructions of the Lords of the Admiralty to the
letter, and journeyed for many days on board the Serapis,
And the people rejoiced greatly to find the nation pos-
sessed an official with so nuch zeal, common sense, and
discretion.
And when the Serapis had arrived in Greece, a certain
Royal Yacht came within half a mile of her bows. And
the Serapis, being manosuvred with great skill by the
Captain (who was new to the ship), cleverly managed to
avoid running over the Royal Yacht by the space of a
cable's length. And those who were on board the
Royal Yacht were filled with wonder, and cried, "We
have had a narrow escape!" And after that the Royal
Yacht contrived to steer clear of the Serapis. And the
distance between the Royal Yacht and the Serapis after
this was usually two miles. And yet there were those
who dwelt on board the Royal Yacht who lived in dread
of the Serapis, saying, "Who is safe from her?"
And when the Serapis was brought to her moorings,
she contrived to carry away two of her anchors. And the
people marvelled greatly, and said, " This is a wonderful
thing! This is the first time a ship so placed has carried
away two of her anchors. The Captain of the Serapis
(who, it is reported, is new to his ship) must be a man
of original genius." And this was the second accident
that happened to the Serapis off the coast of Greece.
And the accidents to the Serapis were considered clever
and unique by mariners of all nations and of every
clime.
And after this the Serapis arrived safely in Bombay.
And when it was told in the Bazaars and the Mosqnes
and the Temples and the market places that the Serapis
had arrived safely, the people were exceeding glad.
And there were those who were surprised at the accidents
that had happened to the Serapis. And this was in
India. But when the story of the accidents was reported
in England, about the champagne in pints, and the
priming of the engines,, and the narrowly escaped
running down of the Royal Yacht, and the carrying
away of the anchors, the people were not surprised.
But when it was reported that the Serapis had arrived
safely in India, the people of England cried with one
voice, "This safe arrival of the Serapis seems to be the
greatest accident of them all!" And Punch, the Imam
of the Prophet, agreed with them I
GOOD NEWS FOR DISTRACTED HUSBANDS
(And others whom it may concern').
AMONG the varied attractions which their establish-
ment offers to Depositors who do not care to be burdened
with the custody of their own valuables, the National
Safe Deposit Company (Limited) advertise that "there
is a room specially adapted and reserved for Ladies."
A word to the unwise, who are unable to keep their
wives out of mischief, or their daughters out of danger
—Apply to the National Safe Company.
Our only regret is that the cost of a Safe specially
adapted for females will probably put such a retreat out
of the reach of many of the victims to marital brutality,
especially in Lancashire and the Black Country.
A Bash Challenge.
ME. PUNCH, last week, after prohibiting all puns on
the name of LOKD MATOB COTTON, was daring enough to
doubt if the most perverted ingenuity could extract any
material for the nefarious practices of the punster from

I BEG leave to lay before you an illustrated plan of my new invulnerable invincible breech-loading Man-of-War.
I have not submitted it to the Government of my country, much lees to any foreign state, for the simple reason that the former would
not be likely to appreciate anything: so radical, not to say "revolutionary" (the latter was the reason why the Elder-Reed-Popoff-
Cirpular-Turtle-Battery was objected to), while the Foreigner pays oft unpatriotic Englishmen by appropriating their plans and
claiming their inventions. I shall therefore content myself for the present with registering my plan and description in your columns.

OUR MAYORS.
THE ninth of November has come and gone to join so many of its prede-
cessors. The loving cup has been passed round, toasts given, quotations
borrowed, hands grasped, and bells rung. We have welcomed the coming and
sped the parting Mayors. Throughout England and Wales, from Bootle to
Beaumaris, from York to Yeovil, the annual transfer of furred gowns, gold
chains, historical maces, and antique wands, has once more taken place, and
our Boroughs have again chosen new Mayors, or been faithful to old Mayors,
or, as in one or two cases, found it a very difficult enterprise to secure any
Mayors at all.
Turning away then our eyes and thoughts for a time from Bombay to Bodmin,
from Turkey to Tewkesbury, from the Herzegovina to East Retford, let us
keep up an established practice, and go through the new tale of Mayors, that
we may form some idea of the way in which the Municipalities are likely to be
governed between now and next November. No interference with the politics
of their Worships will be attempted, beyond the expression of a hearty wish
that they may all be Liberal in their hospitalities, and Conservative of every
good custom and laudable usage.
This year there can be no doubt which Borough ought to take precedence
of all its fellows—Hull, for it has put itself under the sway of a King, in
marked contrast to Maidstone, which is satisfied with the services of a Page.
Wolverhampton happily combines both the civil and military power in its
Major; and the renewed fidelity of Birmingham to its
Chamberlain deserves again to be recorded. It remains
to be seen to what height the Mayor of Truro will
attain: at present all we can say for certainty is that he
is a Clyma.
What great names there are in the list! Sampson at
Leominster, Nelson at Warwick, Livingstone at Swansea,
Manning at Nottingham, Walton (would that his Chris-
tian name had been Izaak!) at Newark, Cotton in the
City of London, and Pinnook at Newport!
While Brighton, ecclesiastical in its views (the Clraroh
Congress met there not long ago), secures an Abbey,
Dover, which so often receives passing visits from
Royalty, not unnaturally shows itspartiality for a
Court. Rotherham has Chambers, Wigan, Burrows;
Leeds a Croft, Great Yarmouth a Barnby, and Rochdale
a Littlewood; Dartmouth, as a true Devonshire town,
possesses a Puddioombe; Wakefield a Gill, and Graves-
end, we are 'particularly pleased to announce, will not
part with its Lake.
Many of the Municipalities are modest in their aims,
moderate in their aspirations. Bath is loyal to a Paynter,
Hanley is contented with a Baker, Canterbury with
a Cooper, Ipswich with a Mason, Tynemouth with a
Potter, Derby with a Turner, Oldham with a Wain-
wright, and Barrow-in-Furness with a Schneider. The
Fowler is at Louth, but the Trappes a long way off, at
Clitheroe; and the Hunt appears to be fixed at Scar-
borough.
Man (we do not forget Wildman at Tamworth) does
not seem to have sole possession of the field. There is a
Wolfe at Bolton, and a Galloway at Gateshead; a
Papillon at Colchester, and a Goldfinch at Favershom:
a Dawe at Penryn, and a Rooke at York.
If Leicester shows a Barfoot, Deal can supply a Nether-
sole. There may be Cutts again at Retford, but there is
Healing at Tewkesbury. Portsmouth has its Pink—it
would be disrespectful to an old and tried joke not to
add—of perfection, and Devonport its May; Coventry
getsl a Berry, and Banbnry a Stone. There is Brown at
Windsor, and White at Launcestpn; and, as a fitting
ending, at Chipping Norton, there is, for the sixth time,
Farwell—can there be a stronger proof that he is a far
better man for the office than any one else in the whole
place? __
THE CIRCULAR IRON-CLAD.
WHO invented the Circular Iron-clad? REED,
Says ATIMI HAL POPOFF—most frankly indeed—
First started the thought in his nautical brain:
And, this being so, Punch can only complain
That Russia has got, for its sea-warfare's need,
The very first use of the notion of REED.
Build your Circular Ship, Lords of tar and red tape,
But will it from nautical dangers escape?
Alack, the First Lord would be flurried and angered
If, misplaced in a fog.it went down like the Vanguard:
While a terrible rage all the realm will be rapt in,
If it coolly capsizes, and outdoes the Captain.
My Lords may be asked (without answer, I ween)
Why the CZAJS could obtain what they lost for the
QUEEN?
Why, if we must fight upon Neptune's rough tide,
The genius of England should go the wrong side?
Why our sharpest ship-planner from office was hunted,
While improvements in build, thanks to old screws,
were shunted?
Another shrewd question. It touches us all.
And extends from the Neva as far as Whitehall,—
Why should Circular Iron-clads, viciously whirled,
Against the fair fleet of a neighbour be hurled?
Why fight for more provinces, quarrel for trifles,
And tax us to pay for your cannons and rifles?
War's fire is the flare-up of Statesmanship's fuel:
Why cannot Prime Ministers make it a duel?
If England and Germany fail to agree,
DISEAELI and BISMABCK might meet, don't you see?
And, should this occur, Punch is ready to swear,
They 'd fire, as they frequently talk, in the air.
CHANGE OF NAME (suggested for the new Directors).—
The Emma Mine—The Dil-Emma Mine.

CIVIC HONOURS AT SHREWSBURY AND
SOUTHAMPTON.
A REMARKABLE case of mendicity has occurred at Shrewsbury.
The Mayoralty of that Borough was, up to the 10th instant, going
a-begging. Out of the candidates for the office of Mayor proposed
to the Town Council, one was rejected, and the other two declined
their election, and paid £50 each rather than serve. A Correspondent
suggests that this is a scandalous state of things. Yes; but scan-
dalous to the municipality of Shrewsbury or to its population?
Some light on this question may be thrown by accounts received
from another borough—Southampton. Thereat, indeed, a Mayor
was elected on the 9th of November; but after proceedings of which
some idea may be briefly presented thus from the local papers :—
SCENE—The Council Chamber at the Audit Houte. Present— The
Town Council, with a Privileged outer fete, and a dense body
of the General Southampton Public.
Enter ihe Mayor and Corporation, and take their teats. As they
severally appear in succession, they are saluted by the South-
ampton Public as follows:—
Mayor (MR. PASSENGER) arrives.
Southampton Public. Make room for a First-Class Passenger.
You 've not long to sit there: your time 's nearly up. Don't cry!
What's the price of coal V Any coal-tickets knocking about? Have
you had the chain polished up ?—because MB. POTTY did. (This was
a reference to a gentleman in an extensive business including that
of a Plumber and Glazier.)
MB. PHIPPABD arrives.
Southampton Public. "What's the price of meat and paper?
MB. DAMNAIL arrives.
Southampton Public. What's the ticket for soup?
MB. ROGERS arrives.
Southampton Public. Well done. Evergreen! Come at last.
Where's poor BILLY GAMLEN? Look at his trousers!
(An allusion, like most of the preceding and subsequent questions,
to the gentleman's vocation—that of a Clothier.)
Why
MB, LAME arrives.
Southampton Public. Make room '.for HAUBDBAW IA
don't you use your pocket handkerchief?
ALDEBMAN PAYNE arrives.
Southampton Public. Take off your hat, old man. No, he's afraid
of showing his bald head. Your friends the Templars are here.
Ar.DRKM AN .1 IINKS, J.P. arrives.
Southampton Public. Hurrah! Hurrah! Hip,hip, hip, hurrah!
One cheer more, Hurrah! (Could MR. ALDKKMAN JONES, a most
respectable man, have felt himself flatteredf)
MB. SHERITF PBABCE arrives.
Southampton Public. Yah! '8s! Hurrah! On, oh I Coals, coals!
What is the price of coals? MELDBTJM will wait on you. Why did
you shut up poor HABBY ABRAHAM P (A considerable testimonial to
MB. PEABCK.)
MB. G. P. PBBKTNS arrives, struggling towards his seat.
Southampton Public. Now for the King of the Cannibal Islands!
MB. CHIPPEBFIBLD arrives.
Southampton Public. Hollo, here's CHIPPBR! Now you '11 have
some physic.
MB. WESTON and ALDEBMAN TCCKEB, J. P., arrive.
Southampton Public. Knock 'em down, JIMMY! Knock 'em down,
JOHN!
MB. ELLYETT arrives.
Southampton Public. What have you done with your white pony?
After a succession of speeches interrupted by amenities of which
the foregoing are mild specimens, a Mayor was elected. M u. JONES,
a previous Mayor, who had declined re-election last year, now
having consented to undertake the office. But is it not a wonder
how any decent man can be prevailed upon to become Mayor of'
Southampton? and—if Shrewsbury is like Southampton—is it any
wonder that nobody could be got to be Mayor of Shrewsbury?

SBTJEE JEBJEBBHOT received
the Royal party, and conducted
them inside the garden. He
also explained the processes by
which the vultures are gorged
on the Towers."—Report of the
Prince'* Progreti.
"THE Towers" of Silence!" Where, 0 where, are they P
Not where political palaverers stray,
And, while with care all common sense they shun,
Tell what they might, could, would, or should have done;
Not where Cluh gossipers, in full dehate,
Pass on the scandal which they oft create;
Not where deep Dulness reads, without a fear,
What stirs e'en kindred Dulness to a sneer;
Not where fair maids and merry matrons come
To silver tea-kettle and kettledrum;
Not where the waltz's liberal law hath placed
AMANDUS' arm around AMANDA'S waist;
Not where the Woolwich Infant's giant power
Sends twelve-foot iron shields in splint'ry shower;
Not where quick thought and judgment soundly ripe
Set engines roaring in the Square of Type; ^
Nor where, to catch the time's swift change alert,
Punch and his friends are sitting at dessert.
As for gorged Vultures—Princes need not range
In search of them. They haunt the Stock Exchange.
Bight plausibly the gorging Vulture works:
He '11 sell Egyptians, Eries,—even Turks.
When with a customer of shallow brain,
Excited by petroleum champagne,
He '11 say, with countenance most kindly wise,
"The safest thing is buying for a rise."
The man who lives by books which others write,
The man who earns the fame when others fight,
The man who many a legal fraud will dare,
And from a bankrupt, come up millionnaire,—
The man who cures the mass of human ills
By odorous ointment, diabolic pills,—
Such we have had, since first our world began:
No need to search for them in Hindostan.
This nineteenth century is an age of culture,
And cultivates the ever-gorging Vulture.
0 for the Towers of Silence! Let us rest
And leave all Vultures to their own foul nest.
Silence in tower, where great star-movements »tir
The vision of the keen astronomer;
Silence where with a look, half kiss, half Jpraye1,
AMANDUS springs to clasp AMANDA fair;
Silence in Paul's great Gallery, while below,
London lies basking in the sunshine's glow;
Silence when Mr. Punch, who doth determine
To laugh at idiots and extirpate vermin,
Lights a cigar, his regal orinamme,
And calmly cogitates an epigram!
PUNCH'S INVENTORS' COLUMN.
MB. PUNCH does not see why he should be without an Inventors'
Column. He starts one with a few of the patented inventions
which have recently been sent him by imaginative Gentlemen—and
Ladies. Like the words in a Latin Dictionary, he classes them as
"Masculine" and " Feminine," hoping none of them will turn out
neuter.
Balloon for Pic-Nict.—Goes up into the air with a motion as
smooth as silk, and stays there all a summer's day. Special corners
arranged for flirtations. Champagne bottles can be thrown over the
side when done with. Kisses inaudible on the earth's surface. F.
Diring-Betl for Pic-Nics. — Diving Belles . . . pun too obvious.
Warranted not to throw cold water on matrimony. Champagne
bottles can be dropped into the sea. Kisses invisible to people on
shore. M.
Aaron's Rod, redivivut.—Very useful in the City, and also in the
West-End. Scourges, of its own accord, all swindling members of
Syndicates, all men shady on the Turf, all women who talk scandal
and do worse than what they say of their neighbours. Warranted
to draw blood from the thickest cuticle. M.
The New Cinderella's Slipper.—Will only fit the foot of a Lady
who has no guile in her heart, and who knows the true meaning of
love. F.
The Philosopher's Stone.— Reduces to common sense the theories
of DABWIN, HUXLEY, and TYNDALL. For this a large sale cannot
be expected. M.
The Perpetual Motion.—This cannot be offered to the Public,
having been at once purchased by MB. GLADSTONE. M.
The Alkahest.—Turns Tory into Whig, Whig into Radical,
Radical into either. Supposed connection with the modern trinity
-£.t.d. M.
The Magic Inkstand.—Enables anyone using it to write leading
articles for the Times, and poems for Punch, which will bring him
in many thousands a year.* M.
The Perennial Roseate Bloom of Youth.—This recipe is never
failing : so. Ladies fair, attend unto it and you will be beautiful for
ever. Read Punch. F.
• "Credat Judaous Apella,
Non ego."— Punch.
Interesting Experiment.
"SiR,—At thii present time two vessels laden with petroleum are dis-
charging in the Regent's Canal basin, where there are many other vessels
with various cargoes."
THUS a Correspondent writes to the Times. It is evident that the
local authorities are curious to ascertain which is the most des-
tructive, gunpowder or petroleum. The explosion of the gunpowder
barge on the same canal two years ago supplied one factor of the
experiment. These petroleum boats are, no doubt, meant to furnish
the other.
In the City.
"The Aldermen had proved themselves admirable managers, and the
Members of the Common Council . . . took the liveliest interest in the care
of the street* . . . There was only one thing upon which he would not defend
them—namely, for their introduction of aspbatte."—LORD MATOK COTTON,
in proposing the " Corporation of London,'' Xov. 8.
LUBKS there beneath this compliment
In COTTON'S silky phrase,
Another meaning and intent—
You 'd better mend your ways?
High-Water Mark.
MK. PUNCH is informed that, in consequence of a distinguished
member of the Metropolitan Board of Works having got his feet wet
during the late high tide, immediate steps will be taken to prevent
a recurrence of a calamity which has tour or five times reduced
the poor water-side population of the South of London to the
greatest misery.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH ON THE RINK.
PABT I.—The Ute of Skating.

PtmcEt, as everybody knows, is the
real Inspector-General of Nuis-
ances. In the exercise of his official
duties he has been everywhere—
now to a croquet party, now to a
Volunteer review, now to a pas-
sage across the Channel. For
many years he has inspected the
House of Commons, and, when he
has been able to turn his eyes
away from 'Westminster, any number of foreign potentates have laid claim to his attentions.
Only a wonderful man is ubiquitous. Mr. Punch is a wonderful man, and ubiquitous.
Like the steam-hammer, he can crush either a common nut or an uncommon Colonel, either
a fussy nobody or an injudicious somebody. So when a cry reached his ears, " Rinking is
a nuisance," he determined to examine the nuisance for himself, with a view to presenting a
report founded upon his own observations. "Sliding on thin ice" is a favourite amusement
in the City, and "skating upon wheels "is the fashionable dissipation of the West End. They
are equally dangerous. The first usually ends in a fall below par, the last invariably
terminates with a tumble before Ma—that is to say, if the young Lady is attended to the
Kink by her mother. "Skating on wheels" frequently entails sprained wrists and frac-
tured arms; "Sliding on thin ice" constantly causes tarnished reputations and broken
hearts. Mr. Punch, having recently said a great deal about the Sliding in the City, now
turns his attention to the Skating in the West End.
London boasts three Itinks. The first is near a successful rival to Clarjham Junction—the
station of many trains; the second would very possibly be situated m Belgrave Square
were it not established somewhere at the bottom of Ebury Street; the third is at Lillie
Bridge, in close proximity to the Head-Quarters of a Metropolitan Volunteer Corps. Of the
three, perhaps, the last is the beat for beginners. It is paved with asphalte, and asphalte is
excellent for—tumblers. It is, moreover, conveniently near a Cemetery. To fall (on Skates)
is human; to fall with grace and dignity is sublime. Any one can fall. It shall be the task
of Mr. Punch to teach the young idea how to tumble in a manner worthy of JULIUS C/ESA.B,
WOLSEY, or MONSFEUR LKOTAKU. All that is required is a little courage, a great deal of
endurance, and a well-developed taste for the romantic and the picturesque.
Bat, first, let Mr. Punch declare that his duties as Inspector-General of Nuisances
became a sinecure on the Rink. If yon have no objection to what the Railway Companies
call a " severe shaking," and are fond of sprains and bruises, you will find skating on wheels
one of the most delightful recreations in the world. It is no more a nuisance than organ-
grinding, a November fog, or the steam-roller. It is an amusement that is equally well
adapted to young and old. The young have the advantage of strong constitutions, the old
have no teeth. The first have the power to " pull through" the pain of a broken arm, the
latter are free from the danger of losing incisors that can never be replaced. With such
advantages to recommend it, "Skating upon Wheels" must always be popular.
But this favourite diversion may be something more than a frivolous amusement—it may
be converted by the least experienced into one of the most important " opportunities " of a
man's long life. To prove this assertion, Mr. Punch will take an imaginary case. He will
say that Ms. EDWIN BBOWN has for years secretly adored the beautiful and aristocratic
LADY ANGELINA. SMITH. Season after season he has allowed dances and garden-parties to
pass away without putting that important question which even the best of us seldom put
more than half-a-dozen times in as many months. He has never been able to ask her to
become his wife. He may have met her at the Bean Rivage. Ouohy, at the table d'hote, and
then only may have hinted at his affection by the melancholy manner in which he may have
passed her the salt or recommended the salad. He may have seen her at Dieppe, and vainly
attempted to show the depth of his feeling by a hoarse allusion to the _ state of the weather.
He may have done all this, and more, and yet may never have made his meaning quite plain
to the object of his soul's adoration. And it is at this crisis that he determines to visit Lillie
Bridge, with a view to learning the secret of Skating upon Wheels. Perchance he may have
heard that a hated rival knows how to do "the outside edge," and a thirst for vengeance
may be driving hi™ onwards, onwards,
towards the discovery of a solution to that
most difficult of problems "the figure
eight." He is in this state of mind when
he pays a visit to Lillie Bridge.
He arrives at a Railway Station, and
finds a passage leading from the platform
to the Rink. He thinks, "I have left the
wheels of the trains to go to the wheels of
the Skates. Only a few planks separate the
proud power of steam from the weak in-
decision of poor human nature. It is but a
dozen yards from the sublime to the ridi-
culous!" If he continues in this groove of
melancholy thought, he may imagine that,
if "Wheel" is a good name for the Station,
"Woe" is a particularly appropriate one
for the Rink.
He walks into a vast marquee. There
are high poles here and there to support the
canvas, and round the sides run a row of
friendly seats. The place is all but empty.
There is no one there save an accomplished
skater, who pursues his graceful course
with the ease and elegance of a wheel-
wearing Apollo. He hates this skater (who
seems to skate with more than his wonted
elegance as he enters the marquee) with a
savage jealous hate, until he learns that
the services of the Accomplished One may
be purchased with gold, or rather silver.
"Are you going to skate, Sir?" asks a
boy, as EDWIN sits on one of the friendly
seats.
"I am going to try," is the half jocular,
half terror-stricken reply. And then a
bargain is struck between the Experienced
and the Inexperienced. EDWIN is to receive
his first lesson. The boy looks at his feet,
exclaims " Tens," and the fatal skates are
put on. EDWIN tries to rise. For a moment
be stands looking about him proudly, and
then he shudders slightly and hurriedly
resumes his seat. As he does this there is
great whirring of wheels at the ends of
his feet.
"Lean upon me, Sir," says the Professor,
"and I will take you out.
EDWIN once more rises and clings to his
teacher. He moves his right foot, and in a
moment the playful skate carries it quickly
away in an eccentric direction. EDWIN
tries to follow his wayward right foot, and
then there is a strange weird motion of his
until now bashful left foot, and he em-
braces the Professor with what the French
call " effusion."
"You will soon feel your feet, Sir," says
the Teacher. "Now all you have to do is
to keep your feet close together and to
strike out gently. Mind you don't fall."
And EDWIN is alone on a desert of asphalte.
Alone, and on wheels 1
What can he do Y Two yards from him
;s a pole, upon which is fixed a placard. If
can but reach that pule, his head may
yet be saved. He draws his long cloak
jloser to him, and prepares for the sacrifice.
He cautiously advances his right foot. As
le does so he trembles like a leaf on his left
.eg. He puts down his right foot, and,
5 joy I it does not give way I—at least, not
at once. And now his left foot is in the
air, and then there is an awful struggle, in
rhioh dignity is thrown to the winds, and
IB is clutching wildly at the pole. Saved!
He pretends to read the placard. For five
minutes he stands unsteadily perusing the
llules and Regulations. As he does this he
s conscious that a Lady has put on a pair
of skates, and is coming towards him. He
jannot move, he dares not turn his head,
)ut something tells him he is in the pre-
sence of the woman he loves 1
And now Mr. Punch begs to adopt the
dramatic form of description:—

SCHOOL FEES AND FLOGGING.
ACCORDING to the Metropolitan, as quoted by the Pall Mall Gazette .—
"The masters of a Board-School at Tipton have adopted a novel plan of enforcing
payment of school fees. Three children have been 'severely flogged by the masters of the
schools which they attended, owing to their having neglected to take their school-pence
with them.' It seems, also, that at one school there is a regular Hogging hour, at which
non-paying children are whipped."
If this is true, it is visiting the sins of the parents on the children with a
vengeance. Worse, in some cases it is visiting the poverty of the parents on
the children.
It appears that:—
"The School-Board, however, are not horrified at the occurrence, and have not
prohibited the practice, but only express their dissatisfaction at'undue' flogging."
It would be a great satisfaction if a flogging highly due were inflicted on
offenders who—always unless the Metropolitan has been hoaxed—richly deserve
it. Satisfactory as is the knowledge that a savage garotter has been handsomely
whipped, it would satisfy retributive feeling much more to know that the cruel
pedagogues who flog poor children to extort school-pence from their defaulting
but perhaps indigent parents, had been flogged themselves, for their dastardly
brutality, to within an inch of their lives. There was once an eminent hero of
the Prize Ring, celebrated in connection with Tipton. What man—not to speak
of the Tipton School-Board—would not wish such an athlete as the Tipton
Slasher could be appointed to slash their backs with a cat-o'-nine-tails?
THE PEN AND THE POPPY.
AccoBunra to the London and China Telegraph, two prizes, one of £200, the
other of £100, given by MB. J. W. PEASE, M.P., for the two best Essays on the
Opium Trade, have, after much deliberation, been awarded by the Committee of
Examiners; the first prize to MB. SPSOAT, Agent-General for British Columbia,
the »eoond to the REV. F. 8. TUBNEB, Secretary of the Anglo-Oriental Society
for the Suppression of the Opium Trade. MB. PEASE, who appears to be no
Free Trader, is an active member of the Anti-Opium Society. He offered the
prizes with Anti-Opium intentions. The Prize Essays have been doubtless
conceived in an Anti-Opium spirit. Yet they are
announced under the title of "Opium Essays.'f Too
many Essays upon all manner of subjects are found to
produce upon their readers the effect of opiates. Let us
hope, however, that the Opium Essays may possibly
prove so interesting that, on the contrary, they will
deserve to be entitled "Anti-Opium Essays," by answer-
ing their purpose, and not that of the narcotic they have
been written against, but for which, in the latter too
likely case they may serve as substitutes.
THE LITTLE BIRDS TO LESBIA.
(A Bound Robin from Songland to tla Softer Sex.)
"A considerable demand for small birds, especially robins and
wrens, has arisen within the last few months for the decoration
of ladies' hats, this being the latest requirement of fashion. Mot
only are the birdcatchers of the Seven Dials and Whitechapel
unusually busy, but we have the authority of the proprietors of
a large West-End establishment for saying that, great as is the
supply, it does not at all equal the demand."—Lancet, Nov. 13.
'The fashion now so prevalent of ornamenting ladies' hats
and bonnets with small birds, has given «uch an impetus to the
activity of the birdcatchers, both here and in France, as to cause
well-grounded fears for the annihilation of our favourite little
songsters."—Daily Neva.
LESBIA I are Ladies' hearts more cold
Than when your prototype of old
Wept over one dead sparrow?
Has Fashion iced that snowy breast
Where Cytherea's doves might rest,
Till sighs of Songland, sore distrest,
Its feelings may not harrow?
0 Sex, whose softness lords of rhyme,
From soft CATULLUS to our time,
Invoke in songs and sonnets;
Can you look on with smiling face
While La Mode's myrmidons apace
Exterminate our harmless race
To trim your hats and bonnets?
This crowning woe you well might spare:
With Cockney's shot and coster's snare
We long have had our trials;
But is it meet that your commands,
Through Fashion's call, which none withstands,
Should give us to the Herod-hands
Of slaughtering Seven Dials?
Ah I deign to picture, if you please,
Yourpoor petitioners' miseries.
Which well may claim your pity I
Tracked by an ever-thickening throng
Of London louts, who '11 leave, ere long,
Our woodland ways as void of song
As is your smoky city.
Conceive how feathered bosoms throb
When, roughs' rude hands, intent to rob,
In our loved haunts invade us I
Yet not with them, dear Ladies, lie
The wrong, the shame, the cruelty,—
For, did we plead, they might reply,
"'Twas gentle LESBIA bade us."
Think when you trim your hats and " things"
With linnets' breasts and finches' wings,
How many songs you stifle;
Swallows that charmed with darting flight,
And nightingales which gladdened night
In myriads die to deck aright
The moment's modish trifle.
The robin, e'en, who all may dare,
Whom callous Cockney gunners spare,
Must fall as LBSBIA'S quarry.
0 shame, to think that gentle she
Should such a ruthless butcher be!
Could she her slaughtered thousands see,
The Slayer might be sorry.
But if compassion may not move
That breast, supposed the home of love,
When Fashion sways within it,

Self-interest should surely wake
And bid men spare, for Music's sake,
To banish from the hush and brake

ESQ., S.A.8., A.R.F., M.U.F., and Hon. Member of the Dulli-

LAST AND MOST
CHAPTEB.

THB ugliness of modern dress is, in my opinion, undeniable,
look in the glass, and I find it so. I am the best judge of what i
good or bad taste, of what is true o
false in Art, and / say. once for all
emphatically, that modern dress'
hideous.
Male attire is unbecoming, and becom-
ing more unbecoming every day. As to
evening dress, had we all, unquestion-
ingly, accepted the theories of ME. DAB-
wiw, we could not have done more to
illustrate our hereditary deficiency than
we have done in putting on tails. Nol
one tail each, which would savour at all
events of some sort of sense, but two
tails apiece. For my part, so disgusted
am I with this imbecility, that, when
forced by the requirements of my friends
to dine out, I have a coat with only one
tail. It is more ornamental, and more
graceful, simply because it is more in
accordance with the dictates of nature.
As to buttons,—Great Jupiter! why
should I have buttons to a garment that
i j j i i. i. ,, Ja -J ne.ver button, and that was never in-
tended to be buttoned? No, I will not have buttons-except where
necessary: and I am inclined to admit their use, in certain in-
stances, when, however, they might
also, with very little trouble and no
expense, be made artistic as well as
useful.
Nature is our teacher. She never
throws away a chance. All in Nature
is useful, and, according to its sur-
roundings and its intention, ornamen-
tal. Nature has not produced buttons.
Nature has produced coats in endless
variety,_ but I defy every eminent
naturalist to point me out one single
instance of a coat, of Nature's make,
with buttons.
I am not prepared to say what
style of costume would be best suited
for all classes.
I am not certain if something of
this sort wouldn't do:—A sensible hat
—time of JAMBS TKB FOOT,—modern
collars, to protect the face and neck;
shooting coat, to button over, with
large pockets; waistcoat, of course,
and a sort of half caisock, covering
knee breeches or knickerbockers, gai-
ters over stockings and shoes. Then,
on.entering the house, the visitor would simply take off the sort of

outer petticoat, which would have been invaluable out-of-doors as
against cold, wind, and rain, &c., and would appear thus :—


Either in tights or knickerbockers. Or, the dress might be more in
pieces, so that in two minutes an entire change in costume might be
made with the greatest ease.
This might be done with facility, but there is no time now to
spend on details.
The question of dress is (1) what is wanted, (2) what is necessary,
(3) what is absolutely indispensable.
1. What is wanted.—This depends on the person—his position in
society. &o.
2. What 13 necessary.—This also depends on accidents of birth
and education.
3. What is absolutely indispensable. This appears to all. Of
course we must begin boldly with clothes generally. In a civilised
state, they are indispensable.
But why not one garment for everything? Instead of wearing a
stock of things, and making oneself a clothes-peg, existing only for
the benefit of tailors and haber-
dashers, why not one garment—a
simple over-all, a be-all, and end-
all '( And a hat—a hat, of soft
material, to cover the ears in the
wintry tempests, and guard the
pate from the summer sun?


THE HAT IN WIKTIR—SIDES AND
BACK TIED Dowy.
There is perhaps something monkish about this, but I am not at
all sure that the monks' habits are not «« fond the very best. In
lort, a robe, a bed-gown, stockings, and a hat would be all, which,
ecording to my plan, any man would want in this world.
The material would be according to his quality.
One endeavour we ought all to make, i.e. to do away with buttons
ntirely. I have not yet succeeded in tnis. My washerwoman has
ried to do so very often, in her own way, which is not mine.
And so I finish pro tern, my hints towards a Grammar of Decora-
verArt. That what I have written is invaluable, and worth its
eight in gold, I shall be the first to proclaim and to admit. Let
vervone follow my lead, and they will be right. Let them look at
le back numbers of this work, note down the addresses .of the
iops; where certain makers follow my patterns, give their orders
tere, and they will be happy ever after. Farewell 1
HINT TO THE ADMTBALTT.—One gun that will sink an Iron-clad
a shot, is equal to any multiple of it that can be fired from a
roadside, and cheap in proportion.

MUSICAL.
THE questions which naturally suggest themselves to all inquiring
minds, on perusing the following advertisement from a eontem-
>orary—
BOARD (partial) wanted in musical family, by Young Gentleman,
where he can practise singing. Full particulars to " Music "—
are various. What sort of a voice does the Young Gentleman possess?
s he a tenor, a baritone, or a bass? Will he request Maud to come
nto the garden, after—a long way after—the manner of MR. SIMS
IEEVES? Will he inform the musical family, in a way not at all
suggestive of MB. SANTLEY, that it is his wedding morning? or
will he acquaint them, in sepulchral tones, that hearts of oak are
ships? Does he accompany himself, or has that to be done for
aim? Does he wish to sing solos, or to join in duets with the mu-
sical daughters of the musical family? If the latter, is he good-
looking? and what are his prospects? Will he practise in the
mornings, or will the evenings content him? Will he sing in bed (
Will he take a rest on Sundays, or will he then turn his attention to
hymns and anthems? Does he sing French, German, Italian? or
does he confine himself to English? Will he promise not to sing
comic songs? Is his partial board to include beat-np eggs, trochet,
STOLBEBO'S invaluable lozenges, and other compounds good for the
throat?
These questions ought to be answered; although, tor our own
part, we cannot imagine a more delightful resident in the bosom 01
one's family than a Young Gentleman who wants to practise singing.
"Hail to the Chief who, In Trouble, Advances."
A TELEGRAM informs the Public that " The Uncle of the SHAH OF
PERSIA has arrived in Constantinople." Mr. Punch is not aware
whether the SDXTAN OF TURKEY has an " Uncle." If he have, what
a lot of unredeemed pledges he should have on hand just now!
what a godsend must his visit be to the SULTAN in his present state
of impei uniosity, if the Commander of the Faithful has anything
left on which to raise money!

THE LAW AND THE LADY—OF THE MANOR;
Or,'the Menaced Maypole of Ashford-Carbonell.
"The old English practice of dancing around a Maypole haa been Bolemnly
vindicated before the High Court of Justice; and the right of some Shrop-
shire parishioners to a particular piece of land whereon to BO disport them-
Belvea has been established against the contention of the Lady of the Manor."
—Daily Telegraph: Hall v. Nottingham and Others.
THE Men of Ashford-Carbonell they doughtily declared,
That where their Maypole had been raised, that pole should still be
reared;
But the Lady of the Manor and her myrmidons of Law
Took counsel with a view to strike those villagers with awe.
Is it in England's favoured land, on turf by Britons trod,
Where " propntty " 's a fetish, and the landlord as a god,
That resistance to the sacred rights of owners of the soil
Is found among its rustics and its humble sons of toil?
Alas I e'en so; the times have changed; LOBD DARNLEY knows it
well:
And she learns it too, the Lady high of Ashford-Carbonell;
While, sadder still, Law's powers refuse an owner to support—
And the great High Court of Justice backs the Ludiow County
CourtI
So the Parish beats the Lady, for the big-wigged Barons found
That reserving here and there a space for recreation-ground
Was a "reasonable " practice, and that " proputty's" tight clutch
Must be relaxed, nor landlords play the Ahab overmuch.
Hard lines for injured owners! Ay! But tenure of earth's soil
Must be viewed with other eyes than robbers' swag or warriors'
spoil;
From "Custom immemorial" as clear a right may flow
As any Norman WILLIAM or Eighth HARRY could bestow.
If " proputty" were but compelled to render back in full
All it has cribbed from "common-land," how long a face 'twould
pull!
How many a Lord-of-Manors would have to tithe his hoards.
And make bonfires of his fences and his threatening trespass-boards I

To play the Lady Bountiful, with a British Matron's grace,

RECIPROCITY IN PULPIT-ROOM.
THERE has been lately going; on in the
Times a controversy respecting the "In-
terchange of Pulpits ": whether or not it
is lawful and nifht for a Clergyman of
the Church of England to preach in a
meeting-house, or, by his leave, for a
Dissenting Minister to hold forth in a
church. Tliia appears to be a matter that
had best be left to the discretion of a dis-
creet Bishop. To Bishop Punch it would
seem one thing for a Clergyman to change
pulpits with such a Dissenter as the late
DR. BINNEY, another to reciprocate in like
manner with an emissary from BRIOHAM
YOUNG. The appearance of MR. NEWMAN
HALL or MR. SPURGEON in a Low Church-
man's pulpit would be something consider-
ably different from the apparition, in a
Ritualist's, of MONSIGNOR CAPEL. But is
not the one just as legal as the other? At
present, with regard to the interchange in
question, all that appears quite certain is,
that a Parson has no right to change
pulpits with an Auctioneer.

A GOOD PLAIN COOK!
ME. J. C.
MASTEB, that
most ener-
getic pioneer of
civilisation, has
recently. been
visiting Glasgow.
The object of his
journey to the
North was to de-
liver his excellent
Lecture upon "the
Art of Cookery"
—a subject which
is peculiarly his
own. His remarks
were (as usual;
characterised b]
wisdom, mirth
and tact; and no-
thing could pos-
sibly have been
better than his
selections from
Scottish poetry
It is well Ttnown
that LOBD MAYOI
COTTON is a bare

published at the Mansion House Lines on a Turtle, and a Meal toil).
the Common Council, but until the appearance of the two anticipated
pieces specified, the following lines will certainly bear off the palm
as the best culinary poem of modern times :—
"0 leeze me on the canny Scotch,
Wha first contrived without a botch
To make the gutty good hotch-potch.
The French mounseer or English loon
When they come daunderin' through the toun,
Wi' smirks and smacks they gulp it doun,
And lick their lips fu' brawly,"
But ME. BUCKMASTEB'S prose is even better than his verse. At
Glasgow he was addressing an audience composed of all classes of
the people. Under these circumstances he could not have chosen
his words more wisely. To quote the report—
MB. BUCKMASTEB said :—
"The cookery schools which I am anxious to establish are intended to teach
people the virtue and religion of domestic life. How many ill-natured words,
quarrels, suits in the Divorce Courts, and even murders, have originated over
a badly-cooked dinner? flow many happy marriages, how many hard-and-
fast friendships, have been formed over a nicely-cooked dinner! No man is
BO dangerous as a hungry, ignorant man when he returns home weary and
exhausted, finds everything in disorder, his wife uncleaned, a mass of greasy
odds and ends turned out for his supper, the sight of which is enough to make
a cannibal sea-sick. (Laughter.) Can you wonder at him using bad language
to his wife, and immediately setting out for the nearest public-house? And
do you think that any amount of schooling, teaching, tracts, sermons, or tea-
parties will efface from the memory of his children the horrid curses they have
heard under such circumstances, and the dreadful scenes they have witnessed';
All tbis misery and demoralisation proceed not from poverty, but from igno-
rance of those duties which every woman ought to know how properly to per-
form before she undertakes the responsibilities of a wife. And, if I were a
despot, no woman should ever be allowed to marry unless she was able to
cook, (tmtghttr.y
And, although the "canny bodies" of Glasgow laughed, ME.
BUCKMASTEB is perfectly right. Take two men of similar tastes,
who have lived similar lives, and give them two dinners with the
same ingredients—one dinner badly cooked, and the other cooked to
perfection, and you will find that he who eats the well-cooked
dinner will be a hundred per cent, happier than the other.
Try the eater of the badly-cooked dinner first. He arrives tired
and hungry at his own home. He sits down, and the first .discovery
he makes is that the soup is cold.
"As usual," he says, with a sigh, "soup cold. Never can get it
hot!"
"You ought to speak to the servants yourself."
"Well." he continues, " after all, it is not so cold as my principal
client. I met him this .morning, and he out me! The soup re-
minded me of it."
The fish appears.
"Hm! not fresh! It never is fresh. The sort of fish that wants
renewing,—and that reminds me that a bill for two thousand pounds
somes due to-morrow, and I don't know where to get the money
from with which to meet it."
The joint arrives.
"Burnt to a cinder, of course! And that reminds me that that
scamp of a son of mine has been burning his fingers on the turf I"
The pudding appears.
"I really can't stand this I It is always the same! Nasty and
expensive. I shall be off to the Club."
And the bad diner disappears, and returns accompanied by a
policeman seeing him home at three in the morning.
Take, on the other hand, the eater of the well-cooked dinner.
He arrives tired and hungry at his own home. He sits down, and
the first discovery he makes is that the gonp is hot. .
"As usual!" he exclaims, with a smile. "Soup hot. Never get
it cold in this house."
"You should praise the servants, it is their doing."
"Well, it is not so warm as the greeting I got from my UNCIE
HABKT this morning. He was quite affectionate, and asked after
the children most markedly, my dear. Wanted to know their
Christian names in full."
The fish appears.
"Quite fresh! But not fresher than the air of Brighton, my
love,—we will take a holiday there next week. It will do you
good."
The joint arrives.
"Done to a turn. And that reminds me that that good-hearted
boy of ours has really taken a turn for the better. I gave him a
good lecture to-day, and am certain of his reformation. I never
felt happier in my life. Another slice, dear."
The pudding appears.
happy
as this to rest in!"
And so the evening grows into night, and all is good-nature and
contentment.
That is the idea—is it not, MB. BUCKMASTEB?
Cheap at the Money.
MB. PLTMSOIX writes to the Times of last Wednesday—" A single
telegram from the British Government to our Consuls and Vice-
Consuls, authorising them to spend £2 2*. on the proper inspection
of each grain-loading vessel, is all that is required to make the Act
of 1875 virtually operative, and so to save many lives. The neglect
of this will consign them to a watery grave." Of course the British
Government has, before this, thanked ME. PLIMSOLL, and sent the
telegram. Punch is waiting to hear of the receipt of it.
Clerical Nosology.
AT the opening Autumnal Assembly of the Church Conference,
the other day in Liverpool, the Chairman, MB. THOMAS R. ANDBKWS,
said, with reference to the future work of the Society, that " they
had a number of typical oases of Kitualism ready to be submitted
to the new Judge when he entered upon office." Is ME. ANDBEWS

WHEN the First Lord of the Admiralty was raised to his exalted
position, Mr. Punch was good enough to celebrate it by observing,
"The Hunt is up!" From the present tone of public opinion,
Mr. P. feels constrained to fear that it is all up with HUNT.

A QUESTION FOR MR. CROSS.
THE subjoined questions and answers afford a specimen of rural
and juvenile intelligence :—
"'How old are you?' 'I don't know.'—'Can you read?' 'Yes, a little
bit.'—'Can you -write?' 'No.'—'Can you reckon?' 'No.'—'How many
are twice two?' 'Seven' (lauyhter).—'Try again, two and two?' 'Eight'
(renewed lattghter).—'Do you know how many commandments there are?"
'No.'—'Do you know the ninth commandment?' 'No.'—'Did you ever
hear anything about bearing false witness?' 'No.'—' Ever before the Magis-
trates?' "JSes.'—'Did they ask you to kiss a book?' ''Ees.'—'Do you
know why you kissed it?' 'No.'—' Did the Magistrates tell you that it was
a testament, and you called God to witness about speaking the truth?' 'No.'"
The examiner in the foregoing catechism was a MB. THOMAS
BLAKE, of Ross, in Herefordshire. He cited it at a public meeting
there, as illustrating, in particular, the moral and intellectual
fitness to give evidence on oath, of SAMUEL RUDOE, a little clown,
ten years of age, the principal witness against EMILY DAVIES, a
child of thirteen, sentenced, on the 17th of September last, by the
Ross Magistrates, to fourteen days' imprisonment in the County
Gaol, and. thereafter to four years' detention in a Reformatory, for
stealing a few plums. MASTER RUDGB was an accomplice in this
extensive robbery, and turned Queen's evidence.
MR. BLAKE also read, as below, part of a letter from MB. MINETT,
lerk to the Magistrates, who pronounced the lenient sentence which
occasioned the above-mentioned meeting, held to denounce it and
get it rescinded :—
I' You have been condemning the Justices upon very meagre information,
jeing information given in open court. The Justices have other information,
and upon that information they have acted."
_ We have lately seen a general fusion of Law and Equity. A par-
icular instance of it is afforded by the Ross Magistrates in dealing
with the case of EMILY DAVIES, only Law prevails; especially in
respect of the evidence, oral and hearsay, this heard out of Court,
on which they convicted her. The evidence last referred to—their
''other information "—appears, from the report of the meeting on
her behalf, to have been false information, affecting the character of
her parents; a sort of information which, in fact, was defamation.
Is it so? This, surely, is a question for the HOME SECRETARY to
consider; for awful as the crime is of which EMILY DAVIES was con-
victed, and imperfectly as it may have been expiated by only four-
teen days' imprisonment in gaol, yet, if her parents are really
respectable people, is it quite fair to them, to say nothing of her,
that she should not be forthwith replaced under their care, instead
of being kept four years longer away from home shut up in a
Reformatory? Perhaps MR. CROSS will deign to answer this crucial
question.
CRIMINAL COURT COSTUME.
SAYS, very properly, the reporter for the Standard, describing tho
scene last week at the Central Criminal Court:—
"Chacun /I ion gout: but that taste can hardly be deemed praiseworthy
which prompts elegantly-dressed, and some young and charming Ladies to
crowd and hustle at the Old Bailey for seats on such an occasion as the trial
for one of the most repulsive murder cases of the present century."
With all our boasted progress of feminine enlightenment, one
might have fancied that Young Ladies would have nowadays
known better than to scramble for admission to a place where a
revolting case of murder was en trial. One would think that
elegant dresses might be displayed with far more fitness in the p - -
cinets of St. James's Court than in the Court of Newgate. 6ho i d
the taste increase for attending courts of justice when murder cases
are on trial, we may expect that the Court milliners will take
advantage of it. Elegant dresses will be advertised for such occa-
sions, and pretty names will be invented for criminal costumes.
Robes d la Calcraft will be considered de rigueur. Young Ladies
will array themselves in shining satin dresses made after the
manner of that worn by MRS. MANNING on the memorable morning
pf her execution; with, perhaps, white cotton head-dresses, formed
in Newgate fashion, and round each snowy tliroat a necklace,
knotted a la mode Jack Ketch.

THE COMPENSATIONS OP LIFE.
RECENTLY, in his travels, Mr. Punch met with a gentleman who
declared that he was an ancient Druid (not in MB. CAKIWELL'S
sense of the word), and that he had helped to build Stonehenge. He
looked dilapidated, but not quite so old as that perplexing edifice.
He did not object in the least, when Mr. Punch—who, when wan-
dering, finds small generosities often to have their reward—pro-
posed a glass of ale. If he was an ancient Druid, and had therefore
lived before ale was invented, how delighted he must have been
to know that to some brilliant genius had occurred the happy mar-
riage of malt and hops!
This Druid talked most wisely, as might be expected of so ancient
a philosopher. He propounded several theories, one of which was
the Theory of Universal Compensation. Others may follow, if
Mr. Punch finds the Druid's philosophy appreciated. He maintained,
being an Optimist, that whatever happens has its compensation—
and that you are always better off than you were before. He
descended from the lofty pinnacle of Druidio antiquity, and deigned
to give from modern time examples of this great Theory of Compen-
sation. Thus they ran:—
1. You acknowledge yourself a descendant of ADAM and EVE.
You cannot, therefore, have any original sin, and may do just as
you like.
2. You are "something in the City." It is very sad, but it means
a good many thousands a year.
3. You are a great poet. Terrible thought I But then nobody
reads your books.
4. You are the Belle of the Season, and are modestly afraid lest
you grow conceited. The Beaux of the Season prefer the dinner-bell.
5. You are the only man who can act Hairnet. Console yourself
by the thought that this is the belief of every man who ever, acted
or even aspired to act.
6. You envy MB. DISRAELI his pride of place. Would you like to
have to scratch a Russian to find the Tartar underneath, or to be
plagued by the Heathen Chinee?
7. You envy MB. GLADSTONE his retirement and renown. Go cut
down an oak in the forenoon, my dear boy, and disestablish the
POPE in the afternoon, and translate a book of the Iliad after
dinner.
8. You meet an elderly wiseacre, who trill talk about the Herze-

THE Political Pad is a singular steed,
Not Pegasus boasts of more various paces.
The Hippogriff beats it in breeding indeed,
Claims pedigree prouder, and daintier graces.
Bat bottom and stay, with a Protean way
Of changing its colours, its paces, its jockeys,
Are points of our nag. It is risky to play
At thimble-rig, "poker." or "nioky-naok-nockies ";
But seers may well shun the Great National Course,
And tipsters eschew the Political Horse 1
He will run well enough in the Buff or the Blue
For a time,—though his distance the sharps cannot settle.
Yet Jocks who are up to the mount are but few:
A seat like a Centaur's, grip, judgment, and mettle,
He '11 want who would back this redoubtable hack;
And, given a Perseus with spur, whip, and bridle,
He '11 fly—yet possesses a curious knack
Of pulling up short with a shy or a sidle,
Which gives the best rider a nastyish spill,
"While Progress—old 'oss—jogs along at his will.
"What jockeys have tried him! Deft Tiverton PAM,
Who oared not to push him beyond a brisk canter,
Kept saddle some time, for the horse like a lamb
Bore bit from that light-handed master of banter.
Then BILL BUFF, a right Jehu, set spurs to his flanks,
And sent him along a rare rattler indeed—
Stiff hedges, stone walls, posts and rails, ditches, banks,
Nothing daunted that jock, or gave check to his steed.
Till the spurring and pace tired the latter, who then
Gently grounded BILL BUFF, and gave seat to BLUE BEN.
BLUE BEN is a jock of the Tiverton rape,
Light hand, quiet seat, and no passion for spurring;
He takes the old plater along at a pace
More steady than showy, more easy than stirring.
But jog-trot or not, there's a certain slow lot
Who from Progress would change the nag's name to Reaction;
And thinking the pace even yet is too hot,
Would look upon "pulling " with much satisfaction.
Nay, had they their way .this Conservative class,
Would put the Political Pad out to grass.
Bat although he may lag, the Political Nag
Has an eye to the goal, and prefers to keep moving;
And BEN, the Blue Jock, is a bit of a wag,
Who may find any day that the pace needs improving.
BEN knows very well did he try to turn back
The steed who beneath him so softly will amble,
He would find himself prone on the turf in a crack,
And BEN is no flat with his chances to gamble.
Bat lest her Blue backers of patience should fail,
He will ride, if they please, "urith his face to the tail!"

JERSEY JUDGES.
AMONG things not generally known is the recent history of the
Jersey Bench of Judges. Of this the Post supplies some interesting
particulars in a narrative of certain truly " notable events," which
have occurred during the .last two 'years and a half. The first of
these was the catastrophe of Judge No. 1:—
"Ma. JOSHUA LB DAII.LY (elected a Judge in 1856), who, in May, 1873,
was placed as a criminal at the bar of the Court in which he had eo often
administered justice. He was chairman and managing director of the Mer-
cantile Union Bank, which suspended payment in February of that year, and
was charged with issuing false and fraudulent reports as to the condition of
the bank, and with embezzling trust moneys under his care. He was found
guilty and sentenced to five years' penal servitude."
Jersey Judge No. 2 :—
"MR. ELIAS NBEL (elected in 1861) wag chairman and managing director
of the Joint-Stock Bank, which suspended payment in July, 1873, its collapse
being hastened by that of the Mercantile Union. In November of that year
MR. NEEL, who sat on the bench during the trial of his former colleague,
MR. LB BAILI.Y, himself stood in the dock on similar charges of issuing false
reports and inducing persons to take shares in the bank at the time it was in
an insolvent state. The jury were divided."
Everybody must be presumed to be innocent who has not been
found guilty. Still Judge No. 2 did not return from the dock to
the bench.
Jersey Judge No. 3 :—
"MB. "WILLIAM GAUDIN. Solicitor, was elected in October, 1873, to'replace
MR. NBEL. Domestic troubles, and the fear of being involved in a lawsuit
with a client for whom he had acted during a lengthened period in the case of
La Cloehe v. La Cloche, had the effect of sending him into a low state of
mind, and in August of the following year he committed suicide."
Jersey Judge No. 4 was rather an improvement on some of his
colleagues and predecessors:—
"MR. PHILIP DUMARRSQ, elected 1869, after attending to his judicial
duties for nearly two years, ceased to attend either the Court or the States, of
which he was an ex-offlcio member."
The nonadministration of Justice is obviously better than its
maladministration; a probability when the Bench is occupied by
Judges who eonimonly have to quit it for the dock. JUDGE
DUM AisKsu persisted in a cpnstant^inattention to his judicial duties
on the sworn plea of disability from illness:—
"His friends pressed him.to resign,.but he stubbornly refused, saying.
'Non, je suis Juge, et comme Juge mourirai.' At length, by repeated
entreaties, he was induced to resign in February last."
The career of Jersey Judge No. 5, M. DE QUETTEVILI.E, appears to
have been suoh as to entitle him, comparatively, at least, to the
respectful denomination he is described by in the statement that :—
"This gentleman was the senior Judge on the Bench (with the exception of
LIEUTENANT BAILIFF BBISSON), having been elected in January, 18ol.
For his history may ^possibly be that of a gentleman indeed,
though an unfortunate one. The account of Jersey Judge No. 5 is
as follows :—
"He was chairman of the Commercial Banking Company, and carried on an
extensive business as a ship-owner, with fishing establishments in Newfound-
land. An action has been for some time pending between him and his co-
partners in the bank, who claim about £23,000 for balance of account and
interest. On Saturday week several judgments were given against him in
the Hoyal Court, and on Saturday last he gave notice of his intention to
appear before M. GIBAUT, the Judge Commissioner of _the Insolvent Court,
with a view of making a composition, with his creditors."
Judge No. 5 will turn out able to pay not
gs in the pound. The result, how-

ever, of having had to be whitewashed, though of nothing worse
than debt," wUl be "to render his seat on the Bench vacant.' Per-
haps his successor will turn out something better than either an
insolvent or a criminal. It may, perhaps, be as well to observe that
it is Old Jersey, the Channel Island, whose judicial bench has been
adorned with the worthies above enumerated, and not New Jersey,
the American State. Old Jersey, indeed, can almost show Judges
with New York. MB. Burr and MB. SULLIVAN may, perhaps be
induced to review their wish to reduce Ireland to the insularity of
Jersey, by the example, presented by the Channel Island to the

OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
(The Prince among the Pig-Stickers,—a Sketch from Life.)
LNTAiiK A , tantarra,
the hunt is up!'
for "'Tie our
opening day! Up
rouse ye then,
my merry, merry
men, for 'tis our
opening dayl"
And, l?If you.'re
waking, call me
early, call me
early, Ayah dear,
as I'm to go
out Pig-sticking,
and hope to get
"first spear."
"And a-sticking
we did no, my
boys, a-sticking
we did go 1
"With a heigho
sticky! Hark
for'ard.harkfor'-
ard tantstieky!
And this is the
burthen of my
song, lo-d.i\ ,i pig must die! To-day a i>ig must die!!"
Just cut that up into verse, sing it, with a chorus, and see how it
goes. It even woke the early Mangoes—the mango is so early that
it's a proverb here "Up with the mango,"—and echoed through
the farspreading chowriet.
You in England haven't the vaguest idea of Pig-sticking. Ah I
it is the sport of sports! You in England would send for a pork-
butcher, or, rather, send to a pork-butcher, and order the pig that
had already been stuck. Not so here. Pig-sticking is the national
sport. Children in arms are brought up to the sound of the dark
Ayahs' voices, accompanied by the tinkle of the budjerow (a native
instrument of a very sweet tone, in shape something between a
pillar-box and a dust-shovel),* singing in Hindostanee (what you
wouldn't understand, so I translate). I give the Orientalisms as
nearly as possible—
"This offspring of the female porker travelled to the place where
the vendors of varieties trade publicly in their merchandise; This,
the next in order of the sons of the sow, preferred to remain in the
house of his parents, where he had been reared; This, his brother,
aat down to a dainty meal; And, this, the next of kin. gat down,
but partook not of the savoury mess; And this, the smallest of the
Porco family, lifted up its voice and wept bitterly, crying ' Qwee,
Q,wee, (Iweek! I'"
Is not this beautiful P Ah, you should hear the Florlkans (a kind
of Indian chorister) chanting it in their deep and wild cadences,
while the Chicks dance around, keeping excellent time on their
charpoyt.t
Well, Sir, to the sport itself. We were aroused in the morning
by the Hakims (Indian pig-huntsmen), who blew the Chont (Indian
hunting-horn made of elephants' tusks), and summoned us from our
comfortable Chupatties (beds).
We were all rather sleepy, having been engaged, deeply, in an
Indian rubber till past four in the morning. (You know a certain dis-
tinguished Royal Personage is fond of his rubber. "Aye, there's the
rub," as What 's-his-name says.) Well, Sir, I am the first to spring
up, and get to boot and saddle. After a hasty breakfast (before the
boot and saddle, of course), we mounted pur Shames (horses about
sixteen hands high, piebald), and nourishing our bunds (Indian
hunting crops, made out of stalks of maize), we cantered gaily
towards the covert side.
• We haye^looked out budjerow in the Dictionary, where the meaning is
distinctly given as " a decked passage-boat." We begin to suspect our Cor-
respondent—or a new Indian Dictionary is a desideratdssimum.—ED.
t Now, we will not stand this. Let the intelligent reader try for himself
if he can't make our old nursery song of " Tha pig went to market," &c., fit
exactly into what our Correspondent (the humbug!) calls the " Orientalisms " f
He may be right, and it may hare a common origin: but we do begin to
suspect. Again we have consulted the Dictionary, and we find the meaning
of flarikan, which he explains as a kind of Indian chorister, to be a "bird of
the bustard tribe;" also the Chicks are not children (as he would have us
believe), but " Thin curtains, made of thread and strips of bamboo;" and,
finally, a Charpoy, which he would palm off on us as another musical instru-
ment, is " a low bed, or stretcher." Our Correspondent, we begin to think,
tells lots of Oharpoys, or stretchers. But we caution the Public, and can do
no more.—ED.
Here the Dewanee Khds (or pig-beater), informed us in a low
voice, or what they call in India a pig's wnisper," that a magnifi-
cent Buckshees (a sort of fine sucking-pig), had been seen within a
few yards of the Sunneer (or shooting lodge by the covert side).*
I have ^scarcely time to describe the exciting scene. We hid
behind thickets, our breath suspended, our pulses beating fast, our
hands on our rifles, our eyes fixed intently on the spot where it was
likely the sucking-pig would rush out of his ambush. The beaters
went in crying ''Jdt! Jail" and only succeeded in driving out a
fine specimen of the Jampaun, t which I kicked over, and it fell in
mortal fear. I picked it up, wrung its neck, and put it into my bag,
for the Jampaun is good eating. A certain Royal Personage cries
out, "Jhool jemadar guddee gurrah.'" "Ja, mynheer!" I replied
in the same tone, though not in the same language. But to me all
languages are alike.*
And in less than no time out rushed one of the finest sucking-pigs
I 've ever seen out of a dish. He made, squealing and squeaking
savagely, for where the Hope of our Nation was standing, who fired
five shots from his rifle, seven from his revolver, and then stood on
the defensive with his sticker.
It was a moment of intense excitement. The sucking-pig jumped
up furiously, the P oe defended himself gallantly, but unfortu-
nately, not Being the old hand at it that I am, he had not learnt the
trick of fence so necessary on these occasions. He fell on one knee;
the pig was making a dash at him which would have proved fatal,
and there was that expression on the pig's face which would have
terrified the boldest of us, when I took one leap, and drawing the
carving-fork (worn on these hunting excursions), I plunged it into
the creature's back, while my knife soon settled the remainder of
the question. He squealed horribly, but I crammed an apple and
an onion into his mouth, and in another second our Cummerbunds
had lighted a fire and were cooking our victim.
Of the affecting scene that followed it would not be becoming in
us to speak. We wept on one another's shoulders. But I leave this
to England's future historian. It was a glorious animal, measuring
at least fourteen inches from the tip of his snout to the curl of his
tail. We gathered about the fire, for the dews were falling, ate
trotters and drank Hafiz (a sort of Indian Champagne, as you may
see by the name, with "fiz" in it), and then rode home singing,
"Mahout! Mahout!" the great hunting song in those parts.
I remain, in hot haste, ever
YOTJB REPRESENTATIVE IN INDIA.
* There must be something wrong with our Dictionary. We've held it
up to the light, we've turned it upside down, we've consulted solicitors and
one of the Indian sweepers of the Metropolis, and we find that the Indian
words used by our Correspondent in the above paragraph bear the following
meanings. Hakim, a "physician;" and he says it's a "pig-huntsman."
Chont, which he describes as another musical instrument, is "one-fourth of
the revenue claimed by conquerors of the soil." A chupatty is "an un-
leavened cake," and he makes "a bed" of it. A bhtmsee, which he turns
into a "horse sixteen hands high," is, in the Dictionary, "a short-winged
hawk;" and a bum/, which he represents himself as flourishing like a whip,
is " an embankment" Dewanee kh&i is not a " pig-beater," but a "hall of
audience;" buckiheei is our old friend baktheesh—not a "pig," but a
"gratuity;" and the bwtneer is not a "shooting-lodge." but a "shopkeeper."
We do begin to suspect our Correspondent, and really think we nave fair
ground for suspicitn.—ED.
t We have looked this word out. Jampaun is "a mountain sedan-chair."
n it be a mistake, or a misprint, or a lapsus calami ?—ED.
J We really do believe this.—ED.
EPI8COPUS LOCUTUS E8T.
AN invitation, signed by all the head-masters but one of every
•eat public school in England, to explain his behaviour towards
!R. GRIGNON has at length "drawn" the BISHOP OF ROCHESTER.
Nothing, in the Bishop's opinion, MR. GRIGNOW could say, could
justify his tone and language touching the Trustees. That is
BISHOP CLATJGHTON'S brief but triumphant vindication of his recti-
tude in sanctioning MR. GRIGNON'S summary dismissal, having
refused to hear him, or to return him any personal reply. No mat-
ter what provocation the Master of Felsted School had received from
the Trustees, nor what length and amount of service he had done
the school. Had he been heard, of course he could not have proved
more than that the latter had been immense and the former exces-
sive. Even if he could have truly said all that, what then? The
Bishop had predetermined to be moved by nothing he could say.
No amount of merits, and no excuse, could be weighed against a
little intemperate language. Now we see what caused his Lord-
ship's long silence. It was a serene consciousness that the pro-
priety of his course in confirming the Trustees' dismissal of
MR. GRIGNON was self-evident. BISHOP CLA.UGHTON is announced
shortly to officiate in a more strictly episcopal confirmation. There
can be no fear that this will be at all prejudiced by comparison with
the other.

Against this fallen Nursery of Saints!
As though post-Reformation times were bare
Of noble names, whose record well might dare
Challenge the mediaeval muster-roll
To free comparison. Science, when she stole
Tradition's rotten staff, left deathless Truth
With unswathed limbs, and still renascent youth,
Plumed for the race. It is not we who fight
Against the ever-brightening flood of light,
Which some—apt heirs of the old monkish whim
That deems all light religious which is dim—
Would darken and divert, nor trust to fall
Save through stained windows in a Church's wall.
Old Oxford's motto's ours; but then we know

From the old source,—nor will we close our eyes
To all save Orthodoxy's scant supplies,
Filtered through Rome's discoloured glasses! Nay I
Love night who will, we dare confront the day!
Derelict? Well, we 've left the Papal Ark,
Finding it hut a crank and leaky bark.
Yet Truth is still our lode-star, and all life
Is but a struggle with that sea of strife
Whose waves so fright you, but to us appear
Less dread than the dull calm you hold so dear.
Derelict? Have you nought abandoned, too?
Freedom, the fearless tracking of the true,
Humbly and trustingly, to God's own ends?
An early love, and all the charm it lends
To Age's memories? Now your later faith
You 'd set against your earlier, and would scathe
The tree which sheltered you because it bears
For fruit the outcome of your younger prayers.
Derelict f 80 we deem your faith to be,
Yet fain would wish you well, and leave you free
To anchor by that " rock" from which doth shine
The faint fixed light you doubtless deem divine.
We seek the dawn—that being our idea
Of " Dominui Illuniinalio Mea."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH ON THE RINK!
PAET II.— The Abuse of Skating.

HAT]Skating on Wheels has
its uses having been proved,
Mr. Punch now turns his
attention to the abuses in-
separable with "Rinkular"
(bran new adjective) loco-
motion. "Aouse of the
Rink" can be heard in
great perfection by listen-
ing to .the talk of begin-
ners, and the murmurs of
the "engaged ones" who
do not skate,' but whose
"futures" do.' The Rink
has its enemies'like every-
thing else Lin the world.
At Brighton, for instance,
where Skating on Wheels is
practised in four different
places, the foes of the Rink
are the Aquarium and the
New Pier. In London,
(when London is London,
i.e., during the Season), the hated rivals of the Rink are Lord's and
the Row. But the Rink has its friends in the persons of managing
Mammas and ubiquitous Surgeons. The first superintend the
wounding of hardened hearts, and the last undertake the setting of
broken arms. Flirtation thrives on the asphalte, the cement, and
the wood, and many are the skaters who, while preserving their
heads, have unconsciously lost their hearts. Nowadays, the edu-
cation of that most wearisome of bores (in male society), the "ladies'
man," is scarcely complete unless it includes amongst " the extras"
a thorough knowledge of how to shout pretty things during the
performance of the "outside edge." He may be able to sing
"Waiting to ZHe,";.he may have mastered the difficulties of mewing
like a cat, or barking like a dog, in obedience to the rules of some
"innocent game;" nay, he may have even gone so far as to wear a
scarf of many colours at a pic-niq, but unless he can skate upon
wheels his popularity with the fair sex will be a thing of the past.
Under these circumstances "ladies' men" can scarcely do better
than practise spouting poetry on wheels. A drill-sergeant might
be in attendance on these occasions to make suggestions. He might
stand in a corner, and when necessary observe, A little louder, if
you please, Sir. i b You can't 'ear that there bit of TENNYSON at
twenty yards' distance. A little louder, if you please." The allu-
sion to the Poet Laureate naturally suggests the following lines,
which may be considered very encouraging and useful to begin-
ners :—
Barly to tumble, early to rise,
Makes a man healthy, stealthy, and wise.
The health and the wisdom may possibly be open to argument, but
there can be no doubt about the stealth. The tiger creeping
towards the unconscious negro destined to serve ere long for an
al fresco dinner, is not more cautious in his movements than the
tyro who has put on his skates for the first time.
Before teaching the young idea how to skate, Mr. Punch begs to
present the public with a few useful
HINK PSOVERBS.
It is the early comer who gets the Rink all to himself.
A foot on the ground is worth two in the air.
Five minutes on the Rink is as good as enough.
Too many tumbles spoil the temper.
You may take a wise man to the Rink, but you cannot make him
skate.
Idleness is the root of all linking.
Look before you tumble.
Give a puppy a bad start, and upset him.
It is a wise skater who knows his own absurdity.
Having unbosomed himself of the above encouraging maxims
Mr. Punch takes the young beginner by the hand, or rather by th<
ear, and gives him his practical advice on the subject of Skating.
lesson the First—The Toe and Heel Step.
Stand up, with the feet turned out in the First Position. Noy
walk away with the toes turned out, the heel of one foot placec
almost touching the toe of the other. Now give a sort of slide, ant
over you go. First tumble.
This is an easy exercise, and should be well practised. When th<
young beginner has mastered the falls in slow time, he shoulc
attempt them in quick.
Lesson the Second—The Glide Step.
Stand up as before, with the feet turned out in the First Position.
pw take your right foot, and rest with your whole weight upon it.
Jive a sort of push with your left leg, remove it from the ground
martly, and you will find yourself 'reclining on the asphalte before
memory regains her hastily-deserted throne. Second tumble.
Lesson the Third—The Best Step.
Sit down, read Mr. Punch, take off your skates, and go home.
If these three Lessons are properly taken to heart, they will be
ound almost more than enough for the most reckless of young
leginners.
And now as to falls.
It is easy enough to tumble (the merest child can manage it); but
x> tumble with grace is quite a different matter. While you go
arefully you will never fall suddenly. Remember there will be
always a premonitory scramble, and this scramble will ever be found
musing by those who take an interest in your eccentric evolutions,
lememoer this, and make your scramble as quaint and intricate as
xjssible. Say that the scramble is over, and you are reclining on
he ground. (By the way, you will soon find yourself quite at home
>n the ground.) And now is the time to improve your opportunity.
The Majestic Tumble should be adopted by statesmen, nistorians,
and dignitaries of the Church. The tumbler, 'on reaching the
fround, should strike an attitude as nearly resembling, as possible,
lome well-known statue. "The Dying Gladiator" will be found
most effective. If the tumbler carries an umbrella, the upper
portion of "The Apollo Selvidere" may often be realised with
;enuine success. Should the fall lack dignity, the tumbler should
it once assume the position of " Ajax defying the Lightning."
The Mysterious Crawl should be the favourite exercise of
Chancery barristers and sensation novelists. The crawler should
wrap his cloak about him, and seem to be inspecting the ground,
vith a view to the discovery of a secret panel. If he notices that
le is observed by those who do not skate, he should immediately
draw a large wide-awake hat over his brow, and dissemble.
The Mirth-Moving Smash is a capital fall for Comic Men,
Amusing Rattles, and other pleasant persons belonging to similar
classes of society. All the smashed one has to do, is to imitate the
inties of a Christmas clown. Should he say, "Here we are again 1"
ic will greatly add to the effect of the tumble. If he acts in amateur
;heatricals (which it is to be hoped he does), he may exclaim, "O,
what a fall was there, my countrymen!" Should he manage to
jreak his leg in the tumble, and thus lay himself up for a month, he
will find, on his return to society, that the accident has become even
more popular than the fall itself.
Before taking leave of the subject, Mr. Punch, in the interest of
;he public, would call attention to the existence of a couple of
SINK NUISANCES.
The Snob's Progress.—The Snob, after getting up his speed,
suddenly backs, and moves blind-fold amongst a crowd of ladies
and children. The result of this manoeuvre is a general stampede.
If the Snob is very quick he generally manages to knock over a
couple of young ladies, and half a dozen tender little boys and girls,
with results that often include broken arms and flattened noses.
The fool's Slide.—The Fool bends his right leg until his head is
within two feet of the ground. He then extends his left foot so that
he appears to be a sort of natural " tea-pot." This vulgar inanity
may be sometimes seen near the Addison Road.
And now, Mr. Punch having written what Skating on Wheels is,
leaves it to his readers' imaginations to realise what Skating on
Wheels might be. One is a pleasant dream—the other an existing
nightmare. Mr. Punch refuses to say "which is which "—no, that,
for obvious reasons, should be left to the decision of Mr. Punch's
world-wide public, after they have tried the one and imagined the
other.
WHAT CAN WE DO FOR HIM?
ADVEBTISEBS are not seldom prone to blowing their own trumpets,
but the following is rather an exception to the rule.:—
A BACHELOR, elderly and somewhat infirm, having a moderate
acquaintance with the Latin and Greek languages, and who is likewise
eipert with a weeding hoe, seeks a HOME and EMPLOYMENT. A bracing
air and easy access to the services of the Church indispensable.—Address, &c.
A smattering of classics, and some little skill in hoeing, can
hardly be regarded as extraordinary acquirements; and we there-
fore cannot wonder that the advertiser makes no claim for any
salary, but contents himself with seeking for employment and a
home. Perhaps he hopes to vary the monotony of hoeing by digging
out Greek roots: but these could little help him in the matter of his
maintenance, and he quite forgets to mention his necessity for food.
However bracing it may be, he can hardly live on air; nor, except
as mental nutriment, can he expect to get much food by frequently
attending the service of the Church.

HE averted his gaze from poor benighted Balliol, and dropped a
little tract into the Master's letter-box.
He scowled at the Martyrs' Memorial.
He went into St. Mary's, and sighed and shook his head at the
University pulpit.
He frowned when he saw Manning's Sermoni in a bookseller's
window.
He called on DB. PUSEY, but, unfortunately, an unavoidable
engagement had obliged the Doctor to go out only a minute before.
lie shuddered when he met two Heads of Houses in " the High,"
laughing and talking together, and seemingly careless of the doom
awaiting them.
For old acquaintance sake he bought a pair of stockings at a cele-
brated hosier's, and was measured for a new hat at an eminent
hatter's.
He listened once more to Great Tom, and mused on CARDINAL
WOLSEY.
He met his old scout, and gave him a sovereign— and a word of
warning when he found that he was still clinging to the poor worn-
out Church of England.
He fairly broke down when he passed the Schools, and thought of
the Thirty-Nine Articles.
He looked with a longing eye at Christ Church Cathedral—and
indulged in a vision of the day when, the Constitution of England
re-modelled, the Members of the Legislature converted, the Dis-
senters exterminated, the Press suppressed, the Middle Classes hood-
winked, public opinion stifled, and the Universities restored to the
happy condition in which they were before the Reformation—he
should " officiate pontifically" in that misappropriated edifice.
He grew melancholy when he met so many promising young men
walking in the paths of fatal error; but brightened up when he
thought of the time (date not yet positively fixed) when the new
University in France would attract all the youth and intellect and
culture of Christendom, and Oxford be deserted—its Colleges and
Halls closed for want of students, its streets grass-grown, its public
buildings in dilapidation, and its revenues applied to the mainten-
ance of Jesuit seminaries.
MY BAKER'S MYSTERY.
OF late, on a dark evening, by my Baker's shop I pat
A neighbouring gaslight through the gloom its radiance dimly cast.
On a high-laden cart it threw a faint and feeble light,
Wherein, as it stood waiting, the cartload glimmered white.
It was, for all unaided sight availed me to divine,
A lofty-towering pile of cubes, in substance crystalline,
Most fike unto loaf-sugar blocks, or cakes of concrete snow,
Compressed, as in the balls which youths at one another throw.
What could it be? A horrid thought there flashed across my mind,
Of a certain earth with acid and alkali combined;
Astringent, deleterious drug, wherewith 'tis sometimes said
Bakers have been suspected of hocussing their bread!
I went a long and thoughtful walk; the cart, returned, I found
Had gone; a portion of its freight lay spilt upon the ground.
I scraped a sample of it up and carried home to see
If I, perchance, could ascertain what that white stuff might be.
Some grains of it upon the fire I tentatively threw.
The glowing coals gave up the thin familiar flame of blue.
'Twas common salt! 0 mind relieved! Now 'Evins be thanked
therefore,—
Not alum, of which my Baker had been laying in a store.
Considering with how little salt a loaf of bread is made,
I joy to think my Baker needs must drive a roaring trade,
Since he so vast a magazine "of salt requires to stow,
As I beheld him taking in to mingle with his dough.

SONGS FOR THE NAVY.
THK acute faculties of Mr. Punch enable him, without
going into the gallery of St. Paul's Cathedral, to detect
even a whisper. It has been whispered that as a last
resource, the Authorities of the Admiralty have deter-
mined to resuscitate the spirit which is generally sup-
posed to have animated our seamen in the days of
NELSON by circulating a choice collection of songs
throughout the Navy. There being no DIBDIN among
us, the productions of various authors, from SHAK-
SPEARE downwards, will be selected for the occasion, and
will include,—
"Fail Fathom Fice," " Down Among the Dead Men,"
"On Yonder Rock Reclining," "Come Unto these
Yellow Sands," "Poor Jack," "How Little Do the
Landsmen Know," " Dawn, Derry, Down," "Man the
Life-Boat," and many others of an equally lively
character.
It is also proposed to alter some of our nursery
rhymes for the education of our future sailors. As a
specimen of what may be done in that way, Mr. Punch is
enabled to publish the following :—
When we 're built up, up, up!
Then we go down, down, down!
Sometimes stern first, sometimes forward,—
But soon we'll be round, round, round!
Enough has been said to give the reader some idea of
the interesting scheme which is in contemplation, and
to rouse the inventive faculties of those who would wish
to aid in the great work. All Mr. Punch can suggest
at present is that something might be made out of the
"Last Lines" of poor THOMAS INGOLDSBY, altered to
"As I lay a synkynge, a synkynge, a Bjnkynge!"
Uncommon Affection. . .
A MAW, seventy-four years old, who lived a lonely and
penurious life in one of the meanest slums in Manchester,
was found by the police the other day dead in his house.
In a safe which they discovered on searching-the pre-
mises, he had left behind him deeds and mortgage-bonds
to the value of £12,000, besides £200 in gold. A journal
announces these particulars in a paragraph headed with
"Death of a Miser." It adds that "Death resulted
from enlargement of the heart." Not exactly the sort
of complaint one would imagine a miser to nave been
troubled with.

FOX-HUNTINQ AND FALLS.
HAIR: "Successto
Fox-Hunting!"
This toast.Igiven
by VISCOUNT
HABDINGE, at
the annual din-
ner of the West
Kent Fox-Hun-
ters, the other
day, at Pens-
hurst, was
drunk, of course,
with acclama-
tion. But could
not Fox-Hunt-
ing possibly be
too successful P
In India, Tiger-
Hunters might
drink "Success
to Tiger-Hun-
ting !"—which,
as generally un-
derstood, would
imply the ex-
termination of
tigers, and, con-
sequently, an end
of hunting them.
Who, except very utilitarian but short-sighted farmers, are they
that would wish Fox-Hunting to succeed so't
In a Fox-Hunter's sense, "Success to Fox-Hunting " means, on
the contrary, no end of Fox-Hunting, and, therefore, perpetuity to
the breed of Foxes. In prefacing that toast, proposed in that point
of view, with an appropriate speech, the noble Viscount said:—
"He had ventured to touch lightly on the accidents of Fox-Hunting, and he
would allude as lightly to the drawbacks. There were drawbacks to every
sport. There were such things ts broken fences, and, unfortunately, the
foxes ate pheasants, and they ate chickens, too. But, as ho had said before,
all the difficulties could be overcome by a spirit of good will and conciliation."
Doubtless; all the difficulties about the poultry and game
devoured, and the fences broken. But how to get over the difficulty
of other breakage—that of broken bones? For, though even this
drawback to Fox-Hunting can to a large extent be surmounted by
surgery, it is occasionally insuperable. Now and then Fox-Hunting
results in a broken neck, which no science can set. The only
wonder is that this dillicnlty does not happen more often. The
infrequency of serious accidents in the hunting-field happening to
be mentioned to a late eminent Surgeon, he, with dreadful disrespect
for a noble sport, accounted for it by quoting the adage that,
"Providence takes care {of drunken men and fools." Where can
that irreverent Surgeon have gone to P

MUSIC AND ITS MURDERERS.
THESE are some people in the world who seem never to shrink
from annoying other people. They take the wrong side of the pave-
ment when they walk along the streets, and either push you off it,
or elbow you aside. They swing their walking-sticks about, so as
to hit you in the eye if you happen to be near them; or they tread
upon your heels by coming suddenly behind you, and with the
point of their umbrellas, couched like lances at a tournament, they
prod you in the back. Such people take delight in coming last into
a theatre, and treading on your toes while stalking to their stalls.
Such persons are especially a nuisance in a concert-room, which they
are pretty sure to enter with abundant noise and bustle after the
commencement, and to leave with the like tumult in the midst of
the last piece.
To persons such as these does ME. AHTHUB CHAPPELL make a
sensible appeal, beseeching them to cease from worrying the audience,
as well as the performers, at the Monday Popular Concerts, where
so charming is the music that there is no excuse for spoiling it by
noise. Says ME. CHAPPELL on the matter:—
"The inconvenience is not merely felt by earnest listeners, but by the
Artists themselves, who have to begin the concert and also to bring it to a
conclusion, and whose attention is inevitably distracted."
The person who disturbs a concert-room in this way is one whom
it were flattery to call a selfish snob. Better far that he or she
should stay at home/and go to sleep over the newspapers, than come
to worry people by unmannerly intrusion, and disturbance of their
pleasure. Though secular in general, the music at the Monday
Concerts may' be looked upon as sacred to the cause of Art. It
should be listened to with reverence, and not interrupted wantonly.
The works of MENDELSSOHN and BEETHOVEN are works of inspira-
tion; and such of them as may not be adapted for a Church, should
not be spoilt by brawling, when given by a CHAPPELL.

bution was sined by " An Inhabitant" of that Town; the t'uther, a

contaned a abscrd "appeal to the benevolent for assistance,"

playnt that over lleleeaf of the Pore 'ad encuridged Porperism. The
former inwitcd Basses to open their Passes, the latter warned 'em
for to bnton upp their Pookitts.
Aeordin' to "An Inhabitant" of Southampton the Number of
Porpers in that unfortnit Town "annually increases, and now
amounts to over one-fifth of the population." He hadds :—
"Indeed there is but One Union under 60,000 inhabitants that spends so
much money as Southampton on the relief of the poor."
The emount thus annivally and orfully wasted at Southampton is
no Less, Sir, than.£23,0001 The "Inhabitant" of Southampton is
werry natterally Asham'd of 'is Naybors for so Grossly Misapplyin
all that Munny. But tha,t ain't all their Bewinus Extravigance wot
increases the Growth of Porperism:—
"This growth is assisted by the unorganised and indiscriminate charity
which is lavishly squandered in the town. For example, last year 14,435 of
its -50,000 inhabitants received gratuitous medical relief, or one to 3J of its
inhabitants."
So, you see, Sir, it's not honly Poroohial "proddigallaty but like-
wise Privat at Southampton wot Encuridges the Brede of them

SOMETHING LIKE A GRIEVANCE.
MY DEAR MB. PUHCH,
I TURN to you in a time of trouble, as I know that nothing will induce
yon to betray my confidence by making this communication public.
I arrived at my house unexpectedly this morning from the country, where I
had been on business. I was tired and cold, and determined not to go to my
office, but to enjoy my Penates in Veneering Square. If ever a man yearned
for the bosom of his family, I was that man.
On my arrival I was somewhat surprised to see the cook at the area-gate
conversing with two rather suspicious-looking men; and I just caught sight of
the housemaid in rapid retreat, she having observed me. I let myself in with
my latch-key, intending to mention the matter to my wife, or one of my
daughters. I looked into the dining-room. The fire was out, and there was
a general air of untidiness and discomfort. In the breakfast-room I found the
page-boy taking a hasty snack from a particularly choice game pie, the break-
fast-things not having been removed. I learned from this functionary that no
one was at home. My eldest daughter had gone to the skating-rink, my second
daughter had gone out to lunch, but I could glean no other facts from my male
domestic.
I subsequently found my youngest daughter, who should have been
"practising," promenading the square with a moustaohed young gentleman,
the honour of whose acquaintance I do not enjoy. With, i hope, becoming
modesty, I took the liberty of asking my daughter where her Mamma might
happen to be. Her reply stunned me, Mr. Punch,
absolutely stunned me I "Why—didn't JANE tell you?
She's gone with that dear LADY SHOCKEHLY to hear
that most interesting murder case at the Old Bailey!!"
I staggered into my solitary abode, and actually was
obliged to take four glasses of sherry before I could sit
down and write this. What can I do? Tours in all
wretchedness,

(Respectfully Dedicated to the First Lord of the Admiralty.)
ENGLAND is proud of her Iron-clad Fleet,
That all the rest of the world can beat;
Of each mighty monster of the deep,
That at half-a-million is dirt-cheap,
In whose guns the old Vikings' lord of thunder
Wakes again to strike foes with wonder.
The Fleet that will make all navies reel.
If you never Speak to the Man at the Wheel.
What if an Iron-clad sink its twin?
'Tis just that way that fights begin.
Whitehall is pleased that it ended so:
The enemy now our power will know.
What if after, the iron monster tried,
In remorse perchance, a suicide?
It failed, and intelligent folk must feel
'Tis wrong to Speak to the Man at the Wheel.
Another monster starts on her trip
By running into a timber-ship.
'Twas "Shiver my timbers!" once, my males;
This time it came to " Shiver my plates!"
Well, neither sank, and if, by-and-by,
Some of us would fain know the reason why,
A delicate scruple we seem to feel.
Since you mustn't Speak to the Man at the Wheel.
On the Iron Duke an "investigation
Strictly private," must please the nation:
England, of course, don t care to know
Why to DAVY JONES her Iron-olads go;
So an Admiral and Captains three
A confidential Court will be:
And their verdict will that axiom seal—
You mustn't Speak to the Man at the Wheel.
For the sweet little Cherub that sits up aloft—
If Cherubs e'er swear, he must do it ott—
Poor JACK should pray for a smart engineer,
And a kettle of steam that will swim and steer.
Once a sink, or a smash, or a sudden capsize
Would have made old salts make free with their eyes;
But now civility outdoes zeal,
And we never swear at the Man at the Wheel.
Now is there nobody knows what's what?
Have we a Navy or have we not?
Have the men who invent, and the men who contract,
Grown all of them bunglers, in point of fact?
Are we land-lubbers all, who contrive to catch
For the head of our Navy the worst of the batch P
Put a Seaman there with the duffers to deal—
Then you may talk to the Man at the Wheel.
Respice Finem.
(Sy a Crusty Critie.)
MB. DISRAELI is credited by all parties with a fine
stroke of policy in his purchase of the KHEDIVE'S Suez
Canal Shares for £4,000,000. Wait a while. The Con-
tinental Press generally speaks well of it. Nevertheless,
it may possibly turn out an advantage for England.
We shall see.

"A SNAKE-EATING SXAKK.—Difficulties have arisen in feed-

Zoological Society's Gardens, in consequence of his refusal of all
other food except living snakes, which in the winter time it is
not easy to procure in this country. A supply, however, has
been received from the Continent, and the Ophiophagui has just
made a fresh meal. The monster is now engaged in digesting

So make eats snake 1 There is no mistake:
The epicure pines if he can't get snake;

This Elaps ophiophagas

So all Europe o'er they for snakes set traps,
To save him from his sarcophagus.

You may fairly hiss out, "You 're another!"
ENTIRE ABOLITION OF BETTING-HOUSES.—A change

FASHIONABLE STREET-SWEEPERS.
LADIES, pay attention, if you please, to an important piece of
news. We quote it from a letter by a fashionable writer on the
Paris winter fashions:—
"Dark green and grey, with check patterns, are the favourite shades for
dresses. Tnese are worn both in and out of doors much longer than last year;
the skirt, flat in front, grazes the ground at the sides, and runs off in a long
narrow peak, trailing a full yard on the ground."
Crossing-sweepers are but seldom to be seen in Paris, but while
the present fashion lasts their presence is not needed. Their work
will be, no doubt, efficiently performed by Ladies with their pretty
dresses trailing on the ground a yard or so behind them. Dark
green and grey, being rather sombre colours, are quite fit for winter
wear; but, considering the state to which long skirts must speedily
be brought by draggling in the dirt, we should have recommended
mud-colour, as being still more suitable. Check patterns are clearly
d propos, in our opinion. It mast be rather costly work to let your
wife's dress play the part of the besom of a crossing-sweeper; and
her costume may fitly show the figure of the cheque which you
have paid for it.
A FARTHING'S WORTH OF FEELINGS.
IN the (iueen'g Bench division of the Supreme Court of Judicature
the other day, a Miss FRANCES SHIRREFF sued a MR. CRYSTAL for
breach of promise of marriage. ME. CRYSTAL, according to law
report, "is an old gentleman with some private means." Miss
SHIRKEFF " is a dressmaker. Her father said he believed she was
more than forty years old, but he did not know how much more."
They had quarrelled over the purchase of a table, for which the
plaintiff wanted to give what the defendant thought too much;
whereupon, it was stated, she had called him " a stingy old Scotch-
man "; but this she denied. Defendant, on bis part, denied that
he had ever promised to marry plaintiff. That, of course, no British
Jury could be expected to believe. This one returned a verdict for
the plaintiff, but a verdict—in a typical case of crushed affections,
lacerated feelings, and blighted hopes, will it be credited P—of
"Damages one farthing." The Jury, moreover, that awarded to a
confiding girl this uncommonly moderate compensation for a broken
heart, was a Common Jury; presumably composed of shopkeepers,
husbands, and fathers. Is a verdict so contrary to all precedent,
but so nearly in accordance with common-sense as that given by
them in a breach of promise of marriage case, one of the first fruits
of the fusion of Law with Equity?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SUGGESTED ILLUSTRATION
FOR "DB. DABWIN'S MOVEMENTS AND HABITS OF CLIMBINO PLANTS."
(See Murray's List of Forthcoming Works.)
*»* We lad no notion the Doctor would have been BO ready to avow his
connection with his quadrumanous ancestors—the tree-climbing Anthropoids
—as the title of his work seems to imply.
PUNCH AT THE CATTLE-SHOW.
(Another Chapter from the "Progress.")
THE early days of December had come, the time for Annuals and
extra numbers was at hand, and Christmas, with its traditions of
holly, mistletoe, bills, and empty chairs, loomed in the future.
Punch sat in his study, pondering; over a paper. As his eagle eye
rested on column after column of crimes and disasters, he sighed.
Turning, impatiently, from the news, he perused the advertisements,
and found that London was living in the week of the Cattle-Show.
He paused in his reading, and memory carried him back to the days
when the unhappy " exhibits" were stalled in Baker Street, where
the Chamber of Horrors up-stairs found a faint reflection on the
ground-floor. Punch thought, "It is better now. The Agricultural
Hall is large and airy. The beasts are to be congratulated on their
change of quarters.
"Are you going this year, Master?" asked Toby.
"Are you r" was the questioning reply.
"Certainly not," said the Wisest of Dogs, with decision. "Sheep
may amuse collies with nothing better to do, and oxen may please
those thick-headed individuals, the bull-dogs, but as for myself
hate Shows."
"You go to the Dog-Show at the Crystal Palace," said Punch.
"Only out of duty, my dear Master," replied Toby. "You see
the Heads of the Profession are there, and it would never do for me
to absent myself. It would be sure to be remarked, and dogs (espe-
cially those foreign creatures, the Maltese) are so spiteful. Now
confess—were there a Show of Men, would you not attend it?"
"No. I hate Reviews. I carefully avoid Aldershott and th<
Cnrragh. I never go to Iteviews."
"I said a Show of Men—not an Exhibition of Soys." And Toby
was silent.
Punch sat in his arm-chair, and listened to the singing of
kettle. He murmured to himself, "An Exhibition of Men!" and
closed his eyes. "When he opened them again, the study was bril-
liantly illuminated. He could not account for this sudden increase
in the lighting of his cozy little room. The gas was burning as
limly as ever, and the fire was red and nameless.
"How do you do, Mr. Punch?"
Punch started, and then became conscious of a very Bright Per-
onage indeed. This Bright Personage seemed to take to Punch at
ice.
"I belong to a very large family, Sir," said the Bright Personage.
Hundreds and thousands of my brothers have been introduced to
he Public by you, Mr. Punch."
"Indeed! And who may you he P"
"My father's name is Imagination, and I pi called The Idea,
fou were thinking that, instead of visiting the Cattle Show, you
would like to see something of the sort of greater novelty. Now I
can help you,"
"You! The Idea!" exclaimed Punch, contemptuously.
"Wait until you have eeen my power," said the Bright Personage.
1 Follow me, and you will find that you have already left your
study."
And the Bright Personage was right. Punch had certainly f ol-
owed The Idea far away from home. He w.as standing in the
Agricultural Hall.
"Now come with me I" Again following The Idea, Punch found
limself near a number of strange-looking men. Two were fighting
Curiously as he came up to them. They paused for a moment in
..heir combat as Punch approached, and then he found that their
>lows were made of hard words and little else besides.
"What are yon quarrelling about P" asked Punch.
"Quarrelling, is it ?" cried one of them. "And it is quarrelling
;hat we are! Come now, I like that."
"What are you doing, then?"
"Why can't you seeP Are we not an elegant band of united
Brothers a-honouring the greatest peace-maker of the age—the
Liberator, DAN O'CoNNELL P" And the fight was resumed.
"Band of brothers I" exclaimed Punch. "Why yon don't seem
x> be agreed upon any one point."
"It's wrong ye are!" they shouted together. "We agree about
Eome Rule!" And the combat was conducted with increased fury.
"And who are these strange animals?" asked Punch of his guide.
"Bulls from Ireland."
"The Idea!" murmured Punch, who now found himself before
another pen.
He was now in the presence of a number of Ladies. The first who
attracted his attention was dressed in the most gorgeous garments.
Her attire was made up of velvet, satin, and fur. She wore magni-
ficent jewellery; evidently no expense had been spared to make her
costume attractive.
"May I ask who you are, Madam?" eaid Punch, with his
habitual politeness.
"Certainly. I am the COUNTESS OF SCATTEBCASH."
"I congratulate your Ladyship upon your charming appearance."
"0, don't speak of it, my dear Mr. Punch," said the Countess,
hastily. "The fact is, the Earl's estates are dreadfully mortgaged,
and the bills of my dressmakers are a fearfully sore point with him.
But you see I must follow the lead of my dear friend the Duchess."
And then Punch noticed that all the other Ladies were dressed in
exactly the same fashion. One was the wife of a hard-working
professional man; another, "the lady" of a tradesman living
beyond his means; a third, the daughter of a retired Major existing
on half-pay. To these persons Punch put but one question, "Why
do you dress like this?" and the answer he received was, "Because
we are pleased to be like the COUNTESS OF SCATTERCASH; and because
we will be like her Ladyship until the names of our respective
husbands or',fathers appear in the list of bankrupts!"
"And who are these strange creatures who follow one another so
closely and so foolishly P" asked Punch.
"Sheep from England."
"The Idea!"
And now Punch was standing before a group of Men with greedy
eyes and cruel mouths. Their foreheads receded, and there was an
air of stupidity about them which was particularly unpleasant and
irritating. They were speaking in French, and seemed to be in a
very angry mood.
"What is the matter?" asked Punch, using the Gallic tongue
with the purest accent.
"Look here, Sir!" they shouted together. "We are simple-
minded peasants. We cheat one another all the year round. We
are accustomed to do it. A Parisian comes to live in our midst, and
we cheat him. He objects, and we try to kill him, and he objeoti
once more! Did you ever hear the like before? 0 how aggrieved
we are!"
"Who are these amiable persons P" said Punch.
"Untamed donkeys from France!"
"The Idea!"
And now Punch was standing before a hulking scoundrel, with
the most repulsive of countenances imaginable. On this scoundrel's
feet were heavy boots, and in this scoundrel's hand was a bludgeon.

LES PAUVRES DE PARIS.
THE Correspondent of the Daily Tele-
graph tells us that" the other day PRINCESS
DOLGOTIROIIKY wore a pelisse made entirely
of ermine studded all over with diamonds
set in turquoises;" also that "the cloaks
to he seen on the fair shoulders of the
PRINCESSE DE SiOAN1, MADAMK DE TAL-
LEYRAITD, and MADAMK DE ROTHSCHILD
represent 'each, in fur alone, a value of
£4000 sterling." This is going too fur
with a vengeance! Somebody ought to
interfere, and take up the subject, as
this is evidently a "great Pelisse case."
Seriously, aren't there any poor in Paris?
Isn't it going to be a hard winter? and,
instead of four thousand covering the value
of one of these cloaks, wouldn't one of
these cloaks cover the freezing misery of
four thousand, and, in the end, consider-
ably enrich the wearer? The Parisian
unscriptural motto seems to be, just now,
"Fiat Luxe."

"The animals repudiate him."
"Well, then, what is he called?"
"Heiscofferf—a Man!"

"You have been making such a'noise in your sleep, Master," said
Toby.
"So would you, if you had seen the Man-Show," replied Punch,
rubbing his eyes, and recovering from his slumber.
"The Man-Show! Why, what is it like?"
"I will tell yon," answered Punch, now quite wide awake. "It
is twice as instructive, but not half so amusing, as the Cattle-Show
in Islington!"
THE SENSIBLE GHOSTS.
A Story for Christmas.
I HAD been sitting before the fire reading. In my hand had been
a small red book—bound in leather. For hours the walls of the old
oak dining-room had echoed and re-echoed with my roars of heart-
felt laughter.
0 it was a good book. A clever one. Full of quaint stories and
brim-full of excellent pictures. It conveyed information too most
useful to professional men. I was a professional man myself, and
I had found it useful—very useful.
And I had read this excellent book twice from beginning to end.
The fire was going out, and the candles were burning low in their
sockets. I got up to go to bed. As I rose from my chair the clock
struck twelve. The clock of the village church hard-by. I could
not account for it, but the tones of the old church clock filled me
with a sort of strange alarm—a feeling of vague mistrust. Why
was it?
1 rose to go, I repeat, when facing me I found a Shadowy Figure I
There was no doubt about it. My blood froze in my veins, the hairs
of my head stood on end. I was in the presence of a Ghost!
The Shadowy Figure glided across the floor towards the table. 0
that I could forget that moment of intense dread! Even now my
cheek blanches, and my hand trembles as I write of it! It was too
terrible 1 too awfully terrible!
I could not speak, I could not move. My tongue clove to the roof
of my mouth, and my arms hung listlessly beside me. And as I
gazed at the Shadowy Figure the candles in the sockets began to burn
a faint blue. 0 that I could forget I 0 that I could forget!
And even as I looked at the first Shadowy Figure the door opened,
and a second Ghost entered the room, and my brain reeled, and I
felt old before my time.
"Have you got it?" The voice sounded so sepulchral. It was
the second Ghost who was speaking.
"Not yet 1" was the terrible blood-freezing reply.
I summoned up all my courage. I am generally considered a
brave man, and I nerved myself for the task, the terrible task
before me.
"What do you want here?" My voice sounded so strange that
I scarcely recognised it. It seemed to be the voice of a horror-
stricken lunatic.
"We must have it!" shrieked the first Ghost. "We cannot rest
without it! It is our only solace! It consoles us all the year round 1
We read it together, and forget (so entranced are we in its glorious
pages) to roam about the castles we were appointed originally to
haunt. For your own sake give it to us, and you shall not see us
again until next year."
'' Take it from him by force!'' shouted the second Ghost. '' Tell
him that we will have it 1"
The beads of perspiration gathered thickly on my brow. I
trembled in every limb.
"What do you want, Gentlemen?"
"Mr. Punch's Pocket Book for 1876."
When I recovered from my swoon the apparitions and the red
leather-covered book were gone 111
Proverbial Philosophy.
OUR quaint old proverbs are continually receiving illustration
from modern doings and sayings. For example. The Town
Council of Maidenhead (charming retreat! inseparably associated
with the memory of delightful dinners) have been specially enter-
taining a proposition to the effect "that the Mayor do receive a
salary of £250 a-year." Now, can any one doubt that those who
advocated this munificent proposal were influenced by the recollec-
tion of the sterling adage which instructs us that "Money makes
the Mayor to go"?

GENEROUS SELF-DENIAL.
Hostess. "You ABE KOT DANCING, MRP. MIRABEL! I SUPPOSE lou'v* GIVEN DP srcH A FRIVOLOUS AVICSBMEKT!''
Mrs. Mirabel (ilaut Lady of considerable personal attractions). "0 DEAR, no! EOT—A—YOUNG MBS AKB soiKCff, AND I UOM'T THINK
IT'S QUITE FAIR 1O 1IIK GlRLS, 1OU KNOW!"
WHAT THEY (AND WE) SAY ABOUT IT.
In France.—That it is worthy of England the perfidious.
That England is accustomed to the changing of coats.
That the French Government has neglected to do its duty.
That an angry note should have been sent from Paris to the Court
of St. James.
That if this had been done England would have trembled, and
the transaction would have been repudiated.
That a further proof has just been given that England is merely
a nation of shop-keepers.
That all Englishmen are cowards.
That all Frenchmen are heros.
That in spite of everything, the incident only increases the glory
of France.
In Germany.—That England may (with the kind consent of the
EMPEKOB OF GEKMANY), do what she pleases in this matter.
That Germany, on account of the relationship existing between the
two peoples, will not interfere.
That Germany acknowledges the judicious good feeling displayed
by England in disappointing the wishes of that ex-grand nation—
the French.
That Germany congratulates England upon having gained the
consent of Pitmen YON BISMABCK to the completion of the arrange-
ment.
In Austria.—That England, as an Asiatic power, of second-rate
importance, may do what she likes with Egypt.
That Austria is, of course, far too great a country to concern
herself with the petty bargains of a nation of cheese-selling
islanders.
That England need fear no Austrian invasion at present.
That Englishmen should be delighted to hear this piece of good
news.
In Russia.—That England in this emergency has done wisely in
at last obeying the directions of the late KM PKKUU NICHOLAS.
That the transaction is worthy of the Stock Exchange, and is
consequently characteristic of the British Nation.
That, perhaps, under all the circumstances of the case, Russia
will deter the annexation of India until next year.
That England should be very thankful to Russia for thU display
of friendly moderation.
In England.—That Englishmen are not afraid of Frenchmen,
Prussians, Austrians, or Russians.
That people living outside the British Empire may say and think
what they please.
That the purchase of the interest in the Suez Canal was carried
out without the advice, much less the consent, of any foreigner.
That England, if she requires full, free, and unopnfined control of
the Canal for her own imperial purposes, has no wish or intention to
exclude any other nation from the same advantages.
That England, having got a hold on the Suez Canal, and paid for
it, knows how to keep it, and means to keep it, all people and poten-
tates to the contrary notwithstanding.
N.B. What is said in England, Mr. Punch begs to remark,
happens in the present instance to be an accurate statement of facts.
Foreign papers are invited to reproduce this announcement.
Educational Compromise.
THE question whether Education in Board Schools should include
religious instruction, still rages between Denominationaliats and
Secularists. There seems to be a way, which has, as yet, occurred
to nobody, whereby Secularist arrangements, extended to the
utmost, might be adopted with a pure view to Denominationalist
ends. Suppose the Bible and religious books were not only excluded
from District Schools, but the reading of them out of school were
also strictly prohibited, would not the certain effect of that be to
make all the scholars carefully read them?

clawed and beaked gules. Great: a Head Semitic grinnant, winkant, above

JACK'S CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS.
LOOSE my valves, start my rivets, and shiver my plates!
We expects good and bad luck to mingle;
But it never don't rain without pourin', my mates,
And misfortins they never comes single.
One on t'other, galore, they are laid at one door,
Sins whether of o- or corn-mission,
And WARD HUNT we shall see soon the scapegoat will be,
For each sinking and smash, and collision.
The Vanguard had scarce to the bottom been sent,
When, through springs out of gear, shipping water,
The Ram what had caused that disastrous ewent,
Iron .Duke, pretty nigh foller'd arter.
Scarce JOHU BULL nadn't ceased for to grumble and growl
At mischances from this and that blunder,
When the Monarch, behold, of the Halden runs foul,
And they both very nearly goes under.
For ships in succession so comin' to grief
Lay the blame on the right back, my hearties;
'Tis them there Admirality Lords and their Chief
People thinks the responsible parties.
When a Landsman the First Lord your Government makes,
In the place of a Sailor selected,
If there wasn't to happen continial mistakes
'Twould be luck as could ne'er be expected.
But a valve may give way, or a screw may get loose,
Under any command whatsomdever;
All the same, if so be that my Lord is a goose,
As in case that he's able and clever.
And this here is a fact as must all men have struck
When the log of their lives overhauling
That such things often happens as runs of ill-luck
In every department and callin'.
There's failures and tires, there's offences and'crimes,
There's explosions I also may mention,
And famines and fevers occurrin' at times,
Spite of every attempt at prevention.
So likewise, mayhap, comes collisions by sea,
And all manner of naval disasters,
In trains, why and wherefore the reason may be,
Of the knowledge we 're none on us masters.
The causes is laid to the rule of the Stars
By them that from ZADKIEL takes pattern,
There's been Jupiter lately, they tell us, and Mars,
In conjunction together with Saturn.
Good or bad, their effects is a question of doubt.
Let it meanwhile set Sailors a-thinkin',
As a token that all hands had better look out
To keep more ships from smashing and sinkin'.
FLYING KUMOURS.
WE give extended publicity to the following rumours, without
pledging ourselves to the literal accuracy of every particular. Some
of them, perhaps, are not more incredible than the purchase of
177,000 shares in the Suez Canal by this country would have been
considered only a fortnight ago :—
Yesterday the Stock Exchange was violently agitated by a report
that the EMPEROR OF RUSSIA had become so large a purchaser of
shares in the Great Northern Railway, as to give him a preponde-
rating influence in the future direction of that undertaking.
The POPE is understood to have expressed his readiness to render
substantial assistance to the Corporation of the Albert Hall, but
with the express stipulation that the Freemasons are never again to
be suffered to assemble within its walls.
If the telegraph is correct in its announcement that the youthful
EMPEROB OF CHINA is about to become a partner in the Worcester
Porcelain Works, the future productions of that Manufactory must
be largely influenced by Oriental tastes and requirements.
So highly was the SULTAN OF ZANZIBAR impressed by the stability
of the institutions of this country, that he has telegraphed his
desire to become a large purchaser of shares in the Westminster

The money market was violently convulsed this afternoon by the
announcement of extensive projects for the manufacture of plaster-

FRENCH REPUBLIC, and the EMPEROR OF VIENNA were respectively
stated to be deeply interested.
The PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN REPUBLIC is reported to be on
the eve of acquiring a considerable stake in the Langham Hotel.
It is not expected that this action, on the President's part, will lead

FROM the irritation displayed by our French neighbours at] our

had given them the " Cut Direct," from Europe to Asia, instead of
securing a portion of it for ourselves.

Nizams, Princes, Gwaliors, Dhallees and Cherangs, is not likely to
be deceived, nor, may I add, has he the smallest temptation or
inclination to deceive. Besides, apart from other substantial
reasons, best known entre nout (this ia French, not Hindostanee),
was I not chosen for this post because I had taken in Punch for so
many years t Long may I continue to do so. "Believe not the
tales they have told thee.of me," as somebody says in his Thingummy

for I own I have been in a fury since receiving the telegram from
my friend. I was obliged to tell it to a certain distinguished Royal
Indian visitor.
"What will they say in England?" exclaimed H.R.H., much

CURIOUS CONTRADICTION.
ME. EDWAKD ROUND, Vice-Chairman of the Tipton School Board,
writes to say that the article quoted from a contemporary, and
commented on last week by Mr. Punch, under the title of " School
Fees and Flogging," "is simply untrue."
In proof of this assurance M it. ROUND sends the subjoined copy of
a letter from the Clerk of the School Board:—
"To E. BOUND, Esa.
"DEAR SIR, « Tipton, Nov. 26,1875.
"I enclose the extract of the resolution which was passed on account
of the Attendance Officer's Committee of the Western Division reporting that
several children had been withdrawn from No. 3 School on account of undue
flogging, and in one cine the child had been beaten for not bringing its school
pence. "Tours obediently,
"BDWABD RICHARDS."
In the article quoted by Mr. Punch three children were stated to
have been flogged for having neglected to take their school-pence
with them. By the foregoing account several children appear to
have been flogged unduly—flogged for little or nothing—and " in
one case " the offence which the child was flogged for was in fact
that specified in the article declared "simply untrue" by MR. ROUND.
Does he not, on the contrary, prove it to have been at least partially
true? However, perhaps the one child flogged for not bringing its
school-pence was only a little one."
MR. ROUND also sends the subjoined copy of an extract from
certain minutes:—
"Extract from Minutes of October 19, 1875.
"Board-Room, Upton, Nov, 26. 1875.
"Moved by ME. ROUND, seconded by MR. TOMSON, and carried unani-
mously. That the Clerk write the Master of No. 3 School, expressing the
displeasure of the Board at the reports of undue flogging, and that whilst he
must exercise great discretion himself in corporal punishment, it is his duty
to see that the Assistant Master is never, under any circumstances, permitted
to administer such punishment, according to the resolution of the Board of
which he has bad a copy.
"EDWARD RICHARDS, Clerk to the laid Board."
The above resolution merely interdicts flogging by the Assistant
Master. It leaves "corporal punishment" to the Head Master's
discretion. There is nothing in it to prohibit him from flogging
children for not bringing school-pence, if he thinks fit—if, for
example, he suspects they have spent them on their way in lollipops.
This seems, under favour of MB. ROUND, no more than a roundabout
way of putting the statement relative to the Tipton School Board
contained in the article he objects to. Let us hope that if only one
child has been flogged at a Tipton Board School for coming there
empty-handed, that one will be the last.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
Literary.
TUDENT.—Wheu did LY-
COMANDER of NaSOS
flourish? Tell us what
he flouriehcd, ami
•we'll let you know.
AKTFCL, l)oDOEa &
Co. — Thanks, no!
llaving a copy of the
work, we don't care
to subscribe »to an
edition of The Pil-
grim's Progress in
seventy - two half-
crown parti (subscrip-
tions to be paid in ad-
vance). Still, tfo wish
you success.
ASPIRANT. — Yes, a
blank-verse poem on
the History of the
World, from the ear-
liest times to the pre-
sent day, would be
very interesting. But
you must look sharp,
as it is a big subject.
Bow BELLS.—Your poem
on the Rights of
Woman is admirable;
but try and get better
rhymes to "Aurora'
than "saw her," and
to "hippopotamus"
than "rhinoceros."
UMBLE ENERY.—It is
very difficult to judge,
off-nand, whether you
are best fitted to write epic "poems, novels, dramas, or leading articles. But, from
the specimens of each that you send us, we consider that a light portership would
suit you admirably.
INQUIRING FANNY.—You can't find their names in the Biographical Dictionary! Then
we '11 tell you, dear. APPENDIX was a Greek poet, and a friend of SOPHOCLES
GLOSSARY was a contemporary of CHAUCER. Most libraries possess these authors'
works.
Artistic.
UP TO A WRINKLE.—You may certainly invite the Hanging Committee to a champagne
lunch (and you may ask us), but we don't see what good it will do you.
YOUNG BAPHAEL.—If it gives you pleasure, whenever you meet an II. A., to tell him that
all modern painters are idiots, do so. It doesn't hurt us.
CATALOGUE.—No. Mil. WARD, 11.A , has never painted any incidents of the French Ke-
volution, nor any scenes in the life of CIIAULES THE SECOND.
Dramatic.
A LOVER or BEALISM.—We perfectly agree with you that "the effect of Hamlet would
bo much enhanced if the performers were killed really, and not in mere make-belief;"
and we sympathise with your unsuccessful efforts to get a company to play it in
that manner. We consider, when we remember the end of the drama, that you show
much modesty and forbearance in contenting yourself with the small part of Horatio,
A VERY Youso MAN.—The actress whom you mention is very' pretty, but, as she is
married, and is the mother of five children, we must really decliuc introducing you
"with a view to matrimony."
BUNCH.—Head the above answer. We cannot help you to become a " life-long companion
to that divine actor with the god-like eyes," as he has got one already. Still, if he
becomes a widower, we '11 think of you.
Legal.
TIIUSTEK.—Kick your solicitor.
LOVE'S YOUNG LW.AM.—Bring the action, dear. He had no right to break off the
engagement because you had dved your hair from black to a " Venetian red."
EXCITABLE.—If you lost your case, we certainly don't condemn you for seizing your
counsel by the whiskers, and hitting him in the face, but you shouldn't have called the
Judge "a stupid old fool."
Natural History.
PET OP THE FAMILY.—It does show a nasty disposition on your brother's part to object
to your putting your pet hedgehog into his bed.
LOVER OF A.MMAJ,-.—We can't tell you how to charm a rattlesnake. Try stamping on
its head.
TIMIDUS.—If your "full-grown male tiger has got a sore throat," apply a cold water
compress. Oi»ly be cautious.
BURGLARIOUS JIM.—There are no fixed rules to send a fierce and lively bull-dog to sleep;
but, if you have time, you might read him the Athenteum.
General.
IGNORANT.—(1) No. (2) Bosh. (3) Walker. (4) Idiot. (5) Idiot. (6) Shut up.
THIRSTY CARL.—We congratulate you. A young Lndy who refused to marry you, on the
ground that you drank eight quarts of beer a day, would have been an incumbrance
through life.
PITT.—We don't advise you to smoke more than twenty pipes a day, as most Doctors
say thut excess in tobacco is bad.
FRED.—You want to know how much Whiskey will intoxicate
you. Try.
ARTHUR JAMES.—Wo never play Hookey, but if anybody hit
us over the head with a stick, \ve should promptly return it.
LITTLE LOUEY.—Throwing yourself into a river, when you see
« young man, is a very good way of being introduced to him;
but suppose he can't swim?
AMIABLE ALICK.—Bosh about only having met him once. If
you love him, write and tell him so. He won't mind it.
VICTORIOUS AUNTIE.—Not being a relation of yours, we don't
see any objection to your thrashing your Nephews and
Nieces every morning to teach them meekness and humility.
PARVENU.—We don't go to balls ourselves; but if it is against
strict etiquette to shake every one in the room warmly by
the right hand, it shows a genial and affectionate disposition.
LIVERPOOL LUNATICS.—Hunting Cuts with a Fox-terrier is
not the way we should recommend you to spend Sunday
afternoon.
ECAUTK.—If he broke a decanter over your head because he
caught you looking at his hand, he is a simple brute, and
we wouldu't play with him again.
G. C.—It is considered rather aristocratic not to answer letters.
Attention to such matters shows a commercial spirit.
BALAAM.—Misprints in country newspapers must bu very funny
indeed to be admitted to our columns. Misprints and un-
gnimmntical Advertisements are not paid for at the rate of
original articles.

ETENHANDED FLOGGING.
OK the morning of November 24th. a little boy, FBEDEBICK JOHN WHITKAB,
aged twelve, stole two watches and three gold chains out of a private post-bag
Iviag unlocked at the Winchester poet-office. For this offence he was tried at
Winchester Assizes, He had given one of the watches and some pieces of the
watch-chains to JACOB WHITBAR and ANN SMITH, described as of "mature
«*e," who were pat on trial, together with him, for receiving the stolen goods.
They were acquitted; but—
"The boy, FRTOEBICK JOHN WHITBAR, who had pleaded guilty, wai tben sentenced
to three months' imprisonment, twenty strokes of a birch rod, and six years in a re-
formatory."
The effect of twepty strokes f ropo a birch rod, laid on by an ordinarily vigorous
turnkey, will probably be such as, through a tender skin, to impress as tender
4 mind with some idea of the value of property, the lack of which induced
that youag Roniir BOOB, little WHITEAB, to give away what he had stolen,
ajid perhaps mainly contributed to make him steal it. Not that there is any
ground whatever for the slightest suggestion that the scourging to which that
infant criminal has been sentenced is at all too severe. 0 dear, no! Perish the
very ghost of an idea so sentimental! But if there is no reason to deprecate the
infliction of twenty strokes of a birch rod on a email boy for a crime of whose
gravity he was clearly insensible, is there not every reason to desire that an
adult thief who commits an equal offence well knowing what he is about, shall
be liable to receive at least a proportionally good flogging with the cat-o'-nine-
tails? Why, in the scale of vanishment for theft, is torture to be limited to
ehildren? Grown-up rascals are at least as able to bear it; and grant, there-
fore, that mere thieVep, if they had their deserts, would not escape whipping,
does not the conclusion that brutal violence committed in beating and kicking
women and other dfife.iiceless victims, should subject every ruffian guilty of it

RECOLLECTIONS OF THE STOCK
EXCHANGE.
(Vide MB. TEKNYSON'S "Recollections of the Arabian
Nights:')
WHEN the breeze of a golden hope blew free,
In the time of my legal infancy,
The tide of men flowed on with me,
Onward into an Eastern clime,
Where bulls and bears and stags do range
Their paradise, the Stock Exchange— •
0 exquisite the aureate air!
Stunning the champagne-luncheons there!
I oft was bull, I oft was bear,
For it was in the glorious time
Of sumptuous ABDUL Aziz.
At night my hansom bore me West,
And as it whirled through Temple Bar
A votary I to Fashion's star,
By POOLE unto perfection drest:
With youthful wealth no girl finds fauUs,
All doors to me were open wide,
1 was the hero of the waltz,
And anywhere could choose a bride:
In sooth it was a goodly time,
For it was in the golden prime
Of gorgeous ABDUL Aziz.
That Sultan, fond of bird and beast,
Sent men-of-war to search for them,
Bought many a fair Circassian gem
To shine in his Seraglio—
He was the Monarch of the East;
He set his palace walls aglow
With pictures of prodigious price;
He tpent his money in a trice:
Ah, this was just the goodliest time
Of all, the very golden prime
Of lavish AHDUX Aziz.
Bat ah, 'twas all too good to last,
The SULTAN soon this lesson learnt,
That he who spendeth money fast
Will some time get his fingers burnt.
So he proposed half interest,
For all the mighty sum of cash
Obtained from lenders green and rash:
But will he ever pay the rest?
Alack- a-day 1 how sad the time 1
For in his impecunious prime
Is reckless ABDUL Aziz.
A sorrow in my bosom lurks,
My diamond rings I wear no more,—
My Uncle, perhaps, might tell you why.
Remote from Fashion's haunts am I,
And, till I reach the Stygian shore,
I will not speculate in Turks.
But if, in Charon's fatal boat,
SULTAN and 1 are both afloat,
I '11 throw him over, bearing the blame,
So much I hate the horrid name
Of cheating ABDUL Aziz!

"Entuned in the nose full feateously."—CHAUCER.

makes that tuneful Musical Doctor say, "When I was
in England the pronunciation there was BO unmusical as
to be very distasteful to me, and I gave up attempting
to learn the language. Since coming to this country
I see its beauties, and am learning it." Is this pretty
little compliment to the pronunciation of our American
cousins due to the Doctor or his interviewer P 11 to the
former, it shows a highly intelligent appreciation of our
cousin's little susceptibilities, and proves that what-
ever other musicians may think, YON Fiji LOW, at least,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A DREAM OF UNFAIR WOMEN.
r\

KNEBALLT awake, Punch, like HOMER,
has his hours of Bleeping:; but when his
eyes are closed, his mind is at work.
The dreams of Punch have more wis-
dom in them than the wisest moments
of the profoundest sages. Under these
circumstances even tbe sleeping- seconds
of Punch's life are worthy of record,
and accordingly they are recorded.
Without further preface, then, Punch
relates a dream he dreamed a few weeks
ago—a dream that was also a nightmare.
Punch sat on a cushioned seat. His iaoe was
grave—BO grave, that his white wig did not seem
ridiculous—so grave, that his ermined robes did
not seem less becoming than the motley. He was
sitting in a large apartment, with high, narrow
windows, and roughly-fashioned pews. This large
apartment was crammed from the floor to the
ceiling. Near Punch sat men in gaudy robes; and
it was the fiction of the place that these men,
and not Punch, were the real representatives of
justice. And over one of these gaudily-costumed
men hung a sword. And Punch knew that he held
in his hands a power more terrible than that of
those who wield swords, and level lances upon the
field of battle. He knew that he had the power
to condemn a fellow-creature to a painful, a dis-
graceful, a miserable death. And this knowledge
made Punch grave and sorrowful.
And Punch looked round about him. There were advocates in that large apartment so full of the Shadow of Death, in the
lisoharge of their duty; and Punch found no fault with them. Did not their profession bring them into that terrible place F And
here were the reporters, who were there in the service of the Public. And Punch found no fault with them. He knew that crime must
be recorded in the cause of good government and fair play. And then Punch looked upon the white face of a man who was dying—
man who was full of life and strength, and yet was dying. And as he looked at that face, he thought "Who would be here

[// Customers could only change Plates f
who could be away? Who would crowd for excitement to a sight

And Punch looked round about him to see if there were any who
could seek interest in such a fearful sight.
Silk and satin and fur. Gold and silver and jewels. Soft faces
and refined faces and faces strangers to misery and want. Bright
eyes, sparkling and eager. And in the pauses of the terrible show—
when the witnesses were not helping justice to trace to its sources a
horrible crime—there was lunch to regale the body, and merry con-
versation to relieve the mind! But what a show it was I So well
worth looking at, that double opera-glasses were in constant requi-
sition, and a pince-nez almost indispensable! So very interesting
to watch the quivering of the lips of this white-faced man! So very
instructive and so exciting! Will he shudder when he hears
the Judge's tumming up, mil he scream when the verdict of the
Jury is read over to him, will he fall in faint as he listens to the
sentence condemning him to be hanged by the neck until he is
dead P Oh, these are questions worth the answering, and an eager
watch must be kept to learn the replies! So out with the opera-
glass, and on with the pince-nez, so that nothing—not a sigh nor a
shivtr—may be lost I
As Punch looked at these fair faces, he thought that they
belonged to those who were less than women and more than men,
and Punch wished from the very bottom of his heart that the vision
he has related had been indeed—a dream!
Harried Life in the East.
"ACochin paper states that a rich Hyot in South Travaneoru, who has four
wives, makes use of tiro of them by yoking them to his plough."
THIS must be the latest novelty in matrimony. The knowing
Ryot evidently put a a literal interpretation on the word "yoke-
fellow." The Prince should make a point of seeing BO unique an
exhibition of native husbandry.

Is answer to your letter this morning, I am sorry I did not see
you on Monday. I would have come to-morrow, but I feel it is
useless; and as you do not say whether you would pay my ex-
penses one way if I did not engage, Madam, I feel I must now
decline your situation, for I have never had the Servants' Hal]
to clean; in fact, I have never been expected to do any clean-
ing. I have often done my own covers—not that I was expected to
—only because I liked to see them look nice; and I have always
made my own butter, and got up in the morning according to
what]! have to do, not when the other servants have got up; bul
in justice to myself I must now positively decline your situation.
Yours, obediently,

"OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
(With H.R.H. and the Elephants.)
SIB,
I HASTES' to despatch this letter, which will probably
arrive, thanks to extra stamp and other influence which I have at the
Post-Office, before any other paper in England receives the news.*
We are among the Cingalese, and, as I said to a certain distin-
guished Royal Personage, "To be among the Cingal-ege is
Singul-ar."t
lie screamed at it.
He implored me to let him tell it as his own. It was a bargain.
I regretted it afterwards, as my Illustrious Friend spoilt it. He
said, "Tobe among the Cingalese is curtout, isn't it? eh?"and
was annoyed because nobody laughed. Of course a bargain is a
bargain, and I was compelled, in conscience and as a duty to my
family, to decline refunding the lac of rupees which was the joke's
price for three years' Indian use only, and all 9ther rights of
translation and adaptation reserved. 0,1 am quite fair. As I
said, "My dear Sir,
"If I had a joke what wouldn't go,
Wouldn't I force it? 0, no, no, no I"
MY Exalted Friend very nearly bought this couplet of me, but a
loss of two rupees and a half at our Indian rubber laat night had
impoverished the exchequer.
We 've had blazing hot weather—regular Indian summer, varied
by downpours of rain, which washed us all away OB the road, and

quicker in this way. [We do not like the look of this. Why send to Bath
if our Representative is in India ?—ED.]

guished Companion's baggage was all over the place—gun-ca_ses in

The moths ore rather troublesome here; they are as big as crows,
and have a nasty habit of getting into your bed in the dark.
The moon at night is lovely. It is five times the size of the moon
in England, and so we can see distinctly the mountains and the lakes
in it with the unclothed eye. I could almost swear (and for a
verylittle more I would—but it's not worth while telling a falsehood
for such a trifle) I saw a man come out of, what appeared to me to
be, a house in a terrace, number nine, I think, and look at us through
a telescope. Whether this was so or not. at all events the nights
are simply exquisite. My Exalted Friend and myself sit up, after
all the others are asleep, practising our duetts on the concertina;
and as we play "In my Cottage," the dear old familiar air brings
tears to the eyes of all who hear us.

been published.

down a cataract and up again (coming up again, against the falling
stream does take your breath away a little at fint), I ran round to
the tent of my Illustrious Co- Voyageur, and, putting my head
in, called out playfully, "Bo 1" A boot-jack came flying out, and
from the whirring noise within, I knew that my Distinguished
Chief was having his hair brushed by machinery. The natives
are delighted with this, and dance with joy whenever My Gracious
giung Friend allows them to look in at the corners of the tent,
e is so good-natured I
"Sir," I said, for I was the first to bring the news, "there is an
old Tusker."
He darted to his legs, upsetting the Suwarrees (or native hair-
dressers), and exclaimed—" Where?"
"In the jungle!" I replied, scarcely able to control my excite-
ment.
"To horse!" cried my Exalted Fellow-Sportsman. Then turn-
ing to his native attendants, he said, "Worromot retfa y adehtu
oysawwoh !" which was about as pretty a compliment as I 've heard
for some time, but its finesse it so subtle as not to bear translation
into English.*
In another minute my Distinguished Friend, myself, and a few
other notabilities, carrying the bags, extra guns, and luncheon,
were advancing towards the jungle.
Being an old hand at the game. I warned my Illustrious
Co-adshooter not to walk too quickly, but to let me lead the way.
We were on the trail of a rare old Tusker, as I could tell from the
Paundaus (footprints), and also from the Khaldmuts, which were
bent and broken on all sides, t
We had scarcely traversed ten miles of tangled Toofaun and
prickly Vakeel, i. when my old trained dog stood still, and made a
point. Our fingers on our rifles. Hush! There they were!!
Before us lay sound asleep a herd of fifty as magnificent
elephants as I have ever seen : and in the centre lay the old
Tusker himself, snoring heavily.
"The Duke of Task-any," I whispered, to my Exalted and
Appreciative Companion; for even in that perilous moment I
couldn't restrain the joke that rose to my lips.
My Distinguished Friend was convulsed—nearly purple with sup-
pressed laughter.
"Sir," I said, imploringly, "Don't!"
He tried hard not to, but was compelled to stamp. Had it not
been for this, we should have captured the herd,—catch 'em alive
0!—for, as the heel of the Illustrious Personage touched what
seemed to be the Indian pampas grass, our ears were suddenly
sainted with so astounding a whirr, as can only be imagined by
those who know what the simultaneous rise of a thousand pheasants
would be, or the sound of a score of policeman's rattles all going off
at once.
The truth flashed upon me too late 1 My Most Illustrious Com-
panion had trod on a rattlesnake, and the vigilant reptile, which
always keeps watoh by a herd of elephants, had sprung his alarum
with a vengeance.
The natives (amongst whom we observed MB. JEE-JEE-JELIT-
BHOY) bolted, panic-stricken; the suite ran to bring them back;
and in less time than this has taken to tell, we two—my Illus-
trious Fellow-Hunter and myself—were alone among the gigantic
mammoths of the Primaeval Prairie!
The Tusker stood before us, brandishing his trunk aloft, and
whetting his tusks one against the other, like a carver with his
knife and fork, before proceeding to the attack.
My Distinguished Co-Sportsman was pale, but calm. My brow
was unmoved. It was not the first time by many that I had
encountered, single-handed, herds of far larger and more furious
elephants than those by which we were now surrounded.
rt Do not waste your powder." I whispered to my Most Noble and
Illustrious Friend, but never for one moment taking my eye off the
hideous monster that now threatened our existence.
My Royal Pal (an Indian term of friendship and respect), trne to
the pluck of his race, would have blazed away, and then—ah!
what then P
An old Indian hunter like myself knows well that an elephant
must be trapped before he can be shot: the bun first, then the
bullet.
I had provided myself with a more than, sufficient supply of nuts,
* We've been up for nights with dictionaries, grammars, vet towels,
and Indian professors, but can't make It out. A young Gentleman, from the
Universities, happening to look in, gave it na hu opinion that it was only
English written backwards, and could be translated DT—" How was you the
day after to-morrow f" But we refuse to believe that such a trick has been
put upon us. No, it mart be a ran Indian dialect.—ED.

ing. Still, on the other hand,—we will lend out and buy a new Dictionary.—ED.

buns, and gingerbreads, which (with the exception of a small
reserve) I now threw out by handfuls to the excited herd.
This scattered them. They stooped to pick up the much-prized
morsels, and so broke their circle. Then, adopting at once my hint,
my Illustrious Friend and myself retreated, back to back, so that 1
was still facing the Tusker, towards a magnificent Keemcat (a sort
of beech-tree) whose branches offered us a welcome ambush.
This manoeuvre was thoroughly comprehended by the old Tusker,
who knew the moves of the game almost as well as I did myself.
With a shriek of rage, and raising his trunk aloft, he charged at us.
My Illustrious Companion wheeled round suddenly, fired Doth bar-
rels without effect (except that we heard a sharp cry of anguish
from Ma. JBE-JIE-JELLY-BHOY in the rear) and then He stood con-
fronting the enormous foe. Another moment, and even my ex-
perienced hand would have been powerless to save 1 Patting aside j
Court etiquette, I placed my hands on my Royal and Illustrious
Friend's shoulders, forcing him involuntarily to (as the schoolboys
say) "tack in his twopenny," and give me a back. As I sprung
over his head, I dropped my rifle; he fell prone, and I alighted
safely, straddling across the nape of the old Tusker's short neck.
Not the millionth part of a second was to be lost I I leant down,
and pressing my left hand into the soft part of his jowl, tickled
the beast with my right hand while I passed my other across
his eyes, thus completely blindfolding him.» In this position I
placed my lips to his ear, and sang him the Indian snake-charmer's
song, which I had learnt from a faithful old Ayah who had long
been retained in our family. In a low, sweet tone I sang, or rather
chanted—
"Tbab, Ybab gnitnub,
Srehtaf enog gnitnuha."
and so forth—but you would not understand it. To these weird
sounds he sank slowly down, and the entire herd (they are an
imitative race) followed, his example. Changing my melody to that
of the well-known—
"Tmmot ekam moorrof ruoye lonu!"
I slid down, and reaching out my hand to snatch up my suwan (or
short dagger), I was about to despatch him at a blow, when it oc-
curred to me that my Illustrious Co-Sportsman ought to give him
his coup d' Indian grass. This joke I made then and there, and it
might have cost us dear (for it roused the elephant), had not My
Most Distinguished and Royal Friend pulled the trigger of my rifle,
and, at one shot, in the right place, the ancient Tusker breathed his
last at our feet.
I knelt, and cutting off the tusk, presented it, Indian fashion, to
the Illustrious Sportsman, much the same as the brush is given in
our own country.
The other elephants were easy victims. I will not describe the
scene that followed. My Impulsive and Gracious Companion was for
making me a Knight of the Star of India sur le champ. I grace-
fully, but emphatically, declined, quoting the chorus (in a whisper),
"What will Mamma say?"
He pressed my hand, andmurmured, "I shall never forget this day."
Then the merriment began. We sat round the camp fires, drink-
ing Schrofft and Sircar (both delicious Indian beverages, somewhat
resembling our gingerbeer with just a taste of brandy in it), and
singing Routees till the break of day.f
Long ere this, I had stolen off to my tent to write this letter, and
it was with a grateful heart, a feeling of deep thankfulness, and the
consciousness of having earned my repose, that I at last laid my
head on my Pillau,* and slept such a sleep as can only be the lot of

following telegram:—

•ticking for the first time, and had the nonour of killing
the only pig stuck on that occasion, the Prince, who, as
is to be expected from his fine and portly figure, _ feels
the heat considerably, turning to one of his suite, in his
own affable and irresistibly numerous style, observed,
"I must adopt a new motto—Dum (per)spiro tpearo."
I hasten to secure the exclusive publication of this in
the columns of Punch. It has created the best possible
feeling throughout India.
"AKMY, FOBM!"
MB. PUNCH begs to "publish the following letters apropos of the
Army Mobilisation Scheme which have been received at his office
during the last fourteen days:—
MBS. SNOOKS' Boarding House, .
DEAK SIB, Islington-Super-Mare.
I BEAD your paper every week, after it has been put in the
Salon for the entertainment of MBS. SNOOKS' ladies and gentlemen.
I also read the Times, when I can get it away from MAJOR POPLEY
(late of the Royal Shoreditch Highlanders)—the gentleman who
occupies at present MBS. SNOOKS' top-floor back. From reading you
and the Times, I know that you both are just and well-informed.
It appears that the Army is soon to be called out and distributed all
over the country. Why should this be done? As a Vestryman and
a patriot, I beg to ask why?
I will go further. If the Germans or Russians wanted to invade
England, I would ask why shouldn't they? Is not this a free
country r No, my dear Sir, take my word for it, an invasion would
be a blessing rather than a curse to us. In fact, if the gentlemen
ehpse to come in the winter months, their arrival would be the best
thing possible for trade. Lodgers after October are very soaroe. I
appeal to your sense of justice then to make the following announce-
ment public, for the benefit of foreigners in general and Germans
and Russians in particular: Should any number of invaders honour
Islington-Super-Mare with a visit, they will find waiting for them
a hearty welcome, comfortable apartments, and a really excellent
five o'clock table d'hote dinner, at seven shillings and sixpence per
head. I am, dear Sir, yours most truly,

You are always so kind and so nice and so good that I am
sure you will not laugh at me, and call me a "little stupid." Now,
will you p
I think the M obilisation of the Army inost proper. Papa a&ys
that it is very patriotic, and I agree with him. I know that a Ball
is never so nice as when there are a number of Officers present. They
dance so beautifully, and are so very charming. Now are they not?
Bat, from reading the Times, it seems to me that the Guards are all
to be kept in one place! Is this fair? Of course the Cavalry are
awfully nice, and the Rifle Brigade, the Sixtieth, and most of the
Highlanders, are dreadfully pleasant; but, after all, a Guardsman is
a Guardsman. Now isn't he? If they keep all the Guards in one
place, it will be horribly unfair to the rest of the country. Now
won't it?
Surely, my dearest Mr. Punch, the matter might be compromised.
All the Household Brigade might be sent to Fiirtington. and then
everybody would be contented. 0, do see to this, and gain the
heartfelt thanks of Yours most sincerely,

Ma. PUNCH. SIB, Edinburgh.
I HAVE been deeply interested in the account of the pro-
posed Mobilisation of the British Army, which appears to me to be
a very proper proceeding on the part of the authorities. But, my
conscience 1 it will cost very much, very much, indeed 1
May I make a suggestion, which has occurred to me and some
friends, who have talked the matter over thoroughly and com-
pletely over a glass of whiskey?
Surely it would cost less were the Army quartered, rent and
food free, abroad—say in Sweden or Denmark, or some other
law-abiding and weakly defended country, whose inhabitants would
be able to offer no practical objection to the proceeding.
Or, if the money must be spent in the United Kingdom, does it
not stand to reason that it should be spent in Scotland, where there
is plenty of room for half-a-dozen armies, and where the .expendi-
ture is sure to be properly appreciated P

Mr. Punch will regard his efforts to please with indulgence.

MY DEAREST AND BEST FKIES n,
I REALLY think that GEOKOE and HAHIJY have been trying to
do their duty. Of course, it would he more satisfactory to see the
Army instead of only hearing of it. However, now that we have
the shadow, perhaps we may find the substance near at hand.
Shall we agree to hope for the best?
Ever Yours Affectionately,

SOMETHING IN IT.
(To the Editor of Punch.)
CATHOLICS are often charged—when their glasses are
charged—with a sort of festive disloyalty for drinking the health of
the POPE before that of the QUEEN. Of course we Know there is
Protestant precedent for this in the old toast of " Church and State,"
"Church and King." But on the celebration of Founder's Day at
Eton College, at the grand banquet then given, the first toast was
"In Piam Memoriam" and the second toast was "The QUEEN."
Now, Sir, I don't profess myself to be a scholar, but I can't see
much difference between drinking " In Pium" and " In Piam" as a
first toast. The Catholics do the former, the Etonians on Founder's
Day the latter, and both, without any disloyalty, drink "In He-
ginam" second. I am, Sir, yours,
Birch Lane. IGNORAMUS ETONENSIS.
PERSONAL AMENITIES.
(From a High Church Organ.)
"We regret to observe that that 'chartered libertine,' the DBAN OF
WESTMINSTER, has once more degraded the venerable church which is so un-
fortunate as to be committed to his charge, by making ita nave a lecture-
room in which Nonconformist Ministers may disport themselves."
"Who doubts for a moment, that if a saintly, diligent pastor had been
accused of Ritualism by any drunken infidel reprobate, the Archbishop would
have eagerly sprung at the occasion, and tried to ruin him, as he is trying to
ruin MB. BISDALB, for obedience to the teaching of that church which he
himself has sworn to uphold, and has systematically defied throughout his
discreditable career."

(Nov. 30) ia designated as DR. MOFFATT'S Entertainment.—from a recent
Numter of the Chunk Times.

THE MOST PESTILENT OF HERETICS.
THE Times' Correspondent at Rome telegraphs a piece of news
about the POPE which is pleasant if true. Some, time back the
ABCHBISHOF or TTTBIN imposed a vexations restriction upon his
Clergy. By a new regulation he prohibited them from frequenting
public hotels, caffs, eating-houses, restaurants, and refreshment-
rooms, and obliged Priests from the country visiting the city on
business and requiring accommodation, to put up in some seminary,
or other ecclesiastic establishment, at an expense exceeding what
they would have incurred elsewhere. Thus inconvenienced, a
number of the Inferior Clergy appealed to the "Congregational
Council" for redress, on the plea that, "since the Vatican Council,
the regulation of matters of discipline relating to the Clergy
throughout the whole of the Catholic world is vested in the hands
of the Supreme Pontiff only, and that the Bishops have no farther
power beyond that of carrying out the instructions which emanate
from him." The tribunal appealed to is said to have entertained
the complaint, and put the Archbishop on his defence. Further-
more :—
"It is stated that Pros THB NINTH is adverse to the liberty of the Clergy
being unduly restrained, and, upon being informed of the complaint of the
Turinese Clergy, stigmatised discipline of this rigorous character as Jan-
BcniBtio."
Well said, your Holiness. Shall not your poor Priest take his
ease in his inn? Of course, provided he take not too much. Undue
restraint of liberty, clerical or lay, is Jansenistic rigour. Jansenism
is heresy, even in our Protestant eyes, because it is excessively
rigorous—nay, from a British point of view, for heretical de-
pravity, there are no heretics so Dad as those guilty of excessive
rigour. Let them he Anathema .' Sint oculi stout oculi eorum qui a
paupere furantur cerevisiam suam. May they fare, as promoters of
Sabbatarian Acts and restrictive Liquor Laws, the Embitterment
of Sunday Association, and the United Kingdom Alliance. Though,
indeed, among these last there are some even mere depraved than
the followers of JAHSKN rus. Those most wretched Restrictives, may
it please your Holiness, are what we call Advanced Radicals, and
Secularists—Puritans without religion. What can be more intoler-
able than Puritanism destitute of even religious pretence? As though
religion were not for every reasonable being the sole raison d'etre for
the imposition, or the endurance of any restraint on simple self-
indulgence. May all heretics and apostates, who seek to subject
other people to Jansenistic rigour, be, as the holy EBKULPHUS says,
spifilicated and flabbergasted, from the crown of the head to the tip
of the great toe, inclusively of all the intervening organs and
members. In the meanwhile, score we treble X to the POPE. He
has, at last, spoken, whether ex cathedra, or not, with something
like the voice of Infallibility.
FOR ONCE.
MR. POTTCH being continually asked why he does not publish an
Acrostic, simply replies that he is not in the habit of imitating
others, however successful—that, moreover, if he did, most probably
not a single Subscriber would be able to crack his nut, .sup-
posing him to have given his great mind to it. However, if his
Readers like to weary their intellectual jaws, let them put them
to trial on this:—

Elects my Second to expose his view.

If that ia the

of "Gyneoology,"
hut it is doubtful
if his researches
can have embraced the whole of that very extensive science. As a distinct
science, by the way, Gynecology will probably be something new even to philo-
sophers at large. Some few survivors of the pre-Board-8chool period may need
to be told that Gynecology means the Science of the Softer Sex. Let us call
Gynecology the better half of Anthropology. Then we must own Andrology the
worse. The proper study of Mankind is Man in general, and Woman in par-
ticular—the latter claiming his special attention under the name of Gynecology.
At present, however, we appear to be behind foreigners in the prosecution of
that science. We have not any Professors of Gynecology. Perhaps, how-
ever, Gynecological chairs will, in due time, be established at Oxford and
Cambridge. Discourse, they will be open only to men who have taken the re-
quisite degree. Nobody will be eligible to Gynecological Professorships who
is a mere Bachelor.
THE TAR OF THE FUTURE.
HEKE a sheer hulk sits poor JACK STOKER,
A smoking of his screw,
No more he '11 wield a Navy poker,
As he was wont to do;
His face was usually sooty,
His hands were black, but soft:
Ready below to do his duty,
He never went aloft.
JACK seldom from his post departed,
Except to take the air;
His ship was water-tight-compart<d,
The main sluice was his care.
And one day SIOKKK had the folly
To leave the valve unstopped,
The consequence was melancholy,
The vessel—down she pupped!
Yet still JACK STOKER kept his weather-

And when the crew was piped together
JACK STOKKR turned up first.

my dear Punch,
must be legion.
Has any of them

I see them plen-

good cheer they are
no doubt, and cer-

To ram and to run-down
Again and again!

Till they 're well in the way;
And, if they see us,
They can t wear, steer, or stay.

TENDER AND TRUE.
TEE Lords of the Admiralty have issued an advertisement, in-
viting Tenders for the raising of the Vanguard. Amongst the
thousands of letters upon the subject received hourly at Whitehall,
the following seem to be the most promising :—
23i 6, Pipemakers' Buildings, St. Giles1! Alley, W. C.,
MY LOKDS, December, 1875.
Iw answer to your advertisement about the raising of the
Vanguard, I beg to say that I am perfectly prepared to undertake
the task on the most reasonable terms. In reply to your condition
"that all parties tendering shall furnish evidence of their financial
ability to undertake the work," I beg to say that I have large con-
cessions in South America, and am a personal friend of His Excel-
lency the BABON MuNCHAtrsEjr. On receipt of five pounds and six
postage-stamps my tender shall he forwarded to you forthwith.
I am, my Lords, your obedient Servant,
JEREMY DIDDLES,
Knight Commander of the, Golden
Fleece of Costa-Rica.
The Lords of tfie Admiralty, Whitehall.
The Retreat, Harwich,
MY LORDS, December, 1875.
1 SHALL be very pleased to undertake the raising of the
Vanguard. I see that you insist that "the scheme of proposed
operations shall be submitted with the tender." This regulation
seems to me a little harsh; but as I believe I am dealing with
honourable men, I feel no hesitation in sending you my recipe.
Take half-a-pound of common salt, a little salad oil, and a few
Minces of gunpowder, and mix them well together over a slow fire,
being careful to remove the scum as it rises to the surface. Now
get your steam-engine and balloon, and proceed as in ordinary cases
of hair-cutting by machinery. You will now find you have an
enormous lever-power at your command, and the heaviest weights
may be lifted with ease, and even impunity.
Trusting to your well-known courtesy and love of fair play to
keep this secret,—a wonder known only to a few, and shielded from
the curiosity of fools, knaves, and the knife-grinding and brush
manufacturing confraternity generally,
I remain, My Lords, your obedient servant,
LtrarAB Frss,
Companion of the Cold Bath, and only genuine
Pope of Rome.
The Lords of the Admiralty, Whitehall.
241, Paradise Parade, Clapham,
MY LORDS, December, 1875.
WITHOUT hesitation I accept your terms for the raising; of
the Vanguard on behalf of my immediately - to - be - launched
company, "The British and Foreign Fleets Salvage Association,
Limited." You wish me to name a "lump sum" for the job.
Well, say four millions and a half, or, accepting a reduction for
short term—i.e., if cash can be banked before noon to-morrow—
£10,000. Also to give dates " for proposed commencement and pro-
bable end of operations." I intend to commence at once, and shall
very likely get the matter satisfactorily settled by the 1st of April,
1876. Warning you against any slanderous reports you may hear
about me in connection with my recent negotiations with the Court
of Bankruptcy,
I remain, my Lords, your obedient Servant,!

that I shall he happy to undertake the removal of the Vanguard
from the bottom of the sea to any of Her Majesty's Docks.
I notice that you wish the ship to be delivered " in such a state
that she may be docked." May I ask whether you will have any
objection to her being packed in one of my large and commodious
vans, in which I am accustomed to remove families on the most
reasonable terms, and at the shortest notice possible?

The Lords of the Admiralty, Whitehall.
MY LOBDS, 85, fleet Street, E.C., December, 1875.
I HAVE the honour to inform you that I shall be delighted
to undertake the raising of the Vanguard on the following condition.
I propose to descend to the bottom of the sea (where I shall remain
half an hour) and I shall expect all of you to accompany me. I
shall wear a diver's dress, and you can appear in full official costume.
As the result of our little expedition will most probably result in a
change in the government of the Admiralty, I am sure the scheme
I propose will meet with the enthusiastic approbation of the British
Public.

With all the respeet you deserve to receive,

CHRISTMAS "CRACKERS."

OOD cheer being the rule of Mis-
rule, and Mis-rule the rule of
Christmas-tide, the operation
of roasting the Baron of Beef
for the Christmas festivities at
Windsor Castle will be con-
ducted with the usual cere-
monies on Christmas Eve, by
the Yeomen of the Guard (the
Beef-eaters), in the presence 'of Garter King-at-Arms, the junior
Bishop of the House of Lords, the Warden of the Standards, the
Barons of the Exchequer (the New Judicature Act expressly re-
serves their right to the dripping), and the Hydrographer to the
Admiralty. Each of these distinguished personages will, in turn,
baste the Baron appropriately (decorated with the Union Jack,) while
the choir of St. George'ssing " O! the Roast Beef of Old England.'"
newly set by PROFESSOR LIVELY, Mus. Doc. Oxon.
The papers to be read at the Society of Arts between Christmas
and Easter, will most probably be on Mobilisation, Vingt-et-un, the
Advantages of Early Rising, Kinks and Rinking, Double Acrostics
(the LOBD MAYOR and Sheriffs to preside at the distribution of
prizes), Night Lights, Hair Dyes (with practical illustrations).
Mineral Waters, Second-hand Clothes, Pickles and Preserves, and
Torpedoes (with experiments), and Bicycling.
A great revolution is about to take place in the curriculum of
studies at Eton. After the vacation, instruction in Field Sports,
Horsemanship, Practical Land Surveying, Painting in Oil and
Water Colours, Vocal and Instrumental Music, Road-making, Civil
Engineering (including boring, blasting and tunnelling), Natural
History (with frequent country excursions), and Pyroteehny, will
be given to any boy who shall signify his desire (in writing), to the
Head Master to substitute these branches of useful learning for the
study of the ancient Greek and Roman authors, and Mathematics.
A report is prevalent that the Albert Hall is to be converted into
a grand Skating Rink.
It is in contemplation to give a series of popular Lectures,
amusing Readings, and Musical Entertainments (including an exhi-
bition of the Magic Lantern) during the holidays, in which the
Dean and Chapter and the entire Cathedral staff will take part, in
aid of the project for supplying St. Paul's with a peal of bells.
A rumour is afloat that the Lords of the Admiralty intend to take
a cruise in the Iron Duke to the Scilly Islands and Isle of Mull—to
start on the 24th of this month.
It is said to be the intention of the PRIME MINISTER to appoint
either a retired Cabinet Minister or an ex-Colonial Governor to the
Secretaryship to the Local Government Board, vacant by the re-
signation of ME. READ, M.P. The place of Secretary to the Civil
Service Commission will most probably be filled by a former Lord of
the Admiralty.
A Company is in process of formation for the constructisn of an
Underground Railway to connect the Crystal and Alexandra
Palaces.
A gigantic Christmas-Tree will be on view in Westminster Hall
on Boxing-Night. The proceeds will be added to the fund which is
being raised to assist the Vestries and other public bodies in keeping
the streets of London passable on the occurrence of another snow-
storm.
Great News! No more School-rates for London! The City
Companies have unanimously resolved to unite in bearing the entire
expenses of all the Schools now under the control of the Sohool-
Board.
The Government are understood to be in negotiation with His
Highness the KHBDIVE for the purchase and transfer of the Great
Pyramid to Lincoln's Inn Fields—an area which it has always been
calculated this stupendous monument of antiquity would exactly
fill. Should the bargain be completed, the Sphinx, it is said, will
be thrown in, and placed]in front of the official residence of the
FIBST LOHD OF TILE TREASURY in Downing Street.
It is gratifying to learn that the Works to be expressly composed
for the New Opera House on the Thames Embankment are all on
national themes. HERR WAGNER is engaged night and day on a
romantic opera which deals with the eventful annals of the Tower
of London. GOUNOD has selected for his subject the Insurrection of
WAT TYLER; and OFFENBACH'S sprightly powers will have full
scope for display in the story of Robinson Crusoe. VERDI may also
contribute. If so, his libretto will be founded on the Spanish
Armada. ABTHUB SULLIVAN has chosen the history of Boadicea.
Try it!
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I AM about to write to my creditors to inform them that I
cannot conveniently pay their bills for some little time.
Would it be a correct image if I were to suggest to them that I

LIFE AND DEATH INSURANCE.
IN a highly interesting lecture on "Unhealthy Occupations,"
delivered the other evening at the rooms of the Society of Arts,
Adelphi, hy DR. BENJAMIN W. RICHARDSON, F.R.8. :—
"The lecturer said that, according to the certified returns, out of sixty -nine
recognisable occ upation a
in this country those of
barristers and clergymen
stood prominently for-
ward as the healthiest."
Considering: how
many briefless barris-
ters there are, and
how many curates
with nothing but
their stipends to sub-
sist on, one wonders
that the essential
healthiness of their
occupations, as such,
is not more than
counterbalanced by
deaths from' famine.
Many poor lawyers
and parsons would
seem to be obliged to
live considerably
within the bounds
of healthful modera-
tion. Yet they do
live. Behold, my son,
with how little sus-
tenance life may be
prolonged.
The occupations
"found to be most
conducive to short-
ness of life." accord-
ing to DR. RICHAHD-
SON, are "those of
cabmen and coach-
men (not domestic
servants), and of
earthenware manu-
facturers."
As to cabmen and
coachmen, in respect
of mortality, both the
rule and the excep-
tion are intelligible.
The potter is apt to
he turned prema-
turely to clay by
causes which affect
him "during the
stages of drying and
turning the ware"
with all the diseases
incidental to all the
various occupations
injurious to the lungs
and the skin. This
will be new to most
rple ; but they will
still more sur-
prised by what fol-
lows. DE. RICHARD-
SON stated that :—
"The modern system
of hair-brushing by ma-
chinery was most in-
jurious to the operators,
and several cases bad
occurred in which the
hairdresser had been
which, that, if required to brush hair hy any but the usual method,
he would probably demand an extra fee.
It is too clear that artisans engaged in unhealthy employments,
and having wives and children, should by all means if possible
insure their lives ; the rather that the money saved for that purpose,
instead of being spent in drink, would really effect the insurance of
a comparatively prolonged existence. The Insurance Companies,
however, would per-
haps rather wish to
have life insurance
more generally prac-
tised by the long-
lived gentlemen of
the surplice and the
long robe.

"OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
(Gaiety going on. Vive I'amour, cigars, and cognac !)
Mr PEA HOLD CHOWPATTEE,
T was lucky
the M AIU -
KAX.V or
OUDEDOO
left us yes-
terday. We
were not
sorry to get
rid of him.
His pigtail
was always
in some -
body's way,
getting
shut into
a door, or
V> pulled, by
'mistake,
for a bell-
rope. He
was a very
quick-tempered man, but, as I said, "If he's quick, I know a
Quiokwar." (This is a real Indian joke, and depends upon the
correct pronunciation of the word " Guiaoar." It s all right with
the right audience.)
The rank and file is thinning. They can't keep it up. We
cleaned out the THAKORE OF KISHUGGUR, who had come with his
ikets full to buy sweets and toys at the Bazaar for his ladies at
ne. Won't they give it him when he goes back! and won't he
I10TUG* ., — —. _ -—j __ „ _ — .. - .— 0_,_ . _ i v~" *•
be unable to give it them! He hasn't got more than would pay his
fare back to his own Station, and his family circle was expecting
him to return with waggon-loads of dolls and bales of sweeties.
The MAHAKij AIIH OP MYSORE and YOURSOBB are very nice fellows,
but they do not understand ecarte, though at the same time there was
an unpleasant scandal about the SIBDAK OP NOWATYEHAT, which
was hushed up on his consenting to quit the place at once, and
return to his native home; but I did see an ace. a king, a queen,
and one or two other good and useful cards tumble out of his ample
sleeve. However, one mustn't speak ill of the departed—aad he's
gone.
We had a really beautiful ball, and my Illustrious Friend was all
that Fancy could paint him. I had fortunately brought out my
concertina with me, and had been able to give him private lessons
every morning after breakfast, so that my Noble Companion has not
forgotten any of his steps—nor have I; and we did go it 1
ML the advice I gave my Esteemed and Royal Companion was,
"Be affable. Whatever yon do, Sir, be affable/'
And he was Affability itself: in fact the Indians have !al ready
invented a new title of honour for "The Queen's Boy," and
they call him " Khansamah Bagheecha" which "scarcely has an
equivalent in our cold, unpoetical language, but which expresses
their immense undying Love and Reverence for myjAmiable and
Illustrious Companion.*
Well did my Amiable and Distinguished Friend follow out my
instructions. He was Affable. He was the Great Affability. He
danced with the oldest, flirted with the plainest. At the Grand
Tuculla Ball he led out MRS. MUOGAB, the Aunt of MR. HUGGAB
MUGGAB, and kissed Miss FBUMPLY under the mistletoe,! and
* The boy whom we sent out last week to buy a new Dictionary has not yet
returned. He had half a sovereign, and all London before him. This only
shows how difficult it is to obtain a new Indian Dictionary. We hope to hear
from him soon. In the meantime our old Dictionary gives the meaning of the
two words above, thus, Khansamah "a butler," and Bagheecha "a fruit-
garden." Now, the Oriental mind may see something very beautiful and
deeply poetical in the title of " A Fruit-Garden Duller," or " A Butler Fruit-
Garden," but we must honestly confess that we do not see what there is poet-
ical in the idea. The other morning, in order to try by experience whether
there really was something poetical in the notion, we sent our own Butler
into the fruit-garden, and looked at him over the wall. It struck tt» as a very
commonplace affair. On the other hand, our Correspondent says that it ii an
Orientalism, and has no English equivalent. The nearest approach in our
language to a "Fruit-Garden Butler" would be, perhaps, " a green-grocer;"
but still even this, a title expressive of respect and love for our Prince, is not
all that could be wished—at least by a .European. But we must not be
narrow-minded, and are perfectly ready to admit that there is more in India
and other places than is dreamt of in our philosophy. When the boy returns
we shall know more—and so will he.—ED.
t Hallo! What's this? Mistletoe? We've not been in India, and yet
somehow—however if it was mistletoe—still it has a suspicious flavour of home
ity just about this season of the year. Boy with Dictionary not yet re-
ied. Wonder what keeps him i The half sovereign, perhaps.—ED.
slapped old RAO SAHEB Ur HIUIUND ONNERSF.F.SY heartily on the
back, and asked him, in excellent native dialect, "Emag rehtona
evahuoy LliumeJno t" The Rao Saheb was enchanted, but he
revokes at whist, and is rather a nuisance.
I walked round the ball-room, and introduced all the notabilities,
and, in fact, everybody, to my Royal and Affable Companion.
Among the natives I observed SIR COWJUICE JEEUPAHOY, RAO
OUSLX, the RAJAH OP HULLABIIOY, SIR RARS BKKKM AM, and SIR
KITE RANT JELLT BHOY, the RAJAH OP KOLLY WOBBLAR, the
CHIEP OP HOOSUBE HATTAS, SIB MUCKPICKA DUSTHO, DR. JEE JEE
STOOPIDAS, MR. MUCHDHARKAB, MR. SILLIJEE BILLIJEE, and a lot of
other swells, not to mention the great MAHABAJAH OF TATAR OWARU,
who shook two jewelled fingers at me as he was leaving.
To supper the Prince, who had been dancing a galop with Miss
CBAWLEY, after a fast waltz with Miss CREEPER, led in old LADY
STUPHER, and helped her to turkey and iced sausages with a jest
which will scarcely bear repetition. We kept it up with spirit;
and SIB MYNT Jrarp SINGH FLATTEEBHOY would insist on standing
on the table, and giving us his version of " God Bless the Prince of
Waks."
We took shots at him with rolls, and, in avoiding one as straight
as a die in his left optic, he stumbled back over the barley-sugar
elephant, his turban came off, and his stupid old head was hoary
with iced cream.
My Illustrious Friend enjoyed it amazingly.
Before my more than Esteemed Companion quitted Ceylon, two
aboriginal Veddahs were presented to him.
"If you were a bachelor, Sir," I whispered to him, "yon could
marry one of these ladies."
"Why," he returned, falling unwittingly into my verbal trap for
SLJ'HU ih: mot, "I could not, because they are married."
"No, Sir," I returned, chuckling with the humour of my jest,
"They 're not married—they 're Vuldahs!"
You should have heard the shouts at this side-splitter. I implored
him, for the sake of his health and buttons, to desist.
"Dash my buttons!" he exclaimed in a perfect explosion of
humour. And the guns from the Fort saluted this really good joke.
It will be a long time ere that scene is forgotten in Ceylon. It is
now historical.
The telegram about the Ball sent of! to Europe, was simply, "The
Prince appeared to enjoy the evening very much, and did not leave
till after the Tenth dance."
"Pooh-na!" as we say in Ceylon. The Tenth don't dance.
We enjoyed ourselves. On Sunday we all went to church, and
in the evening I read Sandford and Merton to my Illustrious
Friend, and played "Greenland's Icy Mountains" on our concertinas,
arranged as a duett. Weren't we good P I believe you, my JAM-
JEE-JELLY-BHOY!
We send the DtrsE OP SUTHERLAND home. He wants to get back,
look to his fire-engines, and darn his hose.
The Guzzul (or Indian Drink-Maker) has just come in to say that
my Royal and Illustrious Friend is awaiting my presence for a good
story, a glass of Chokee'jtaA. a calm Trinchinopoly cigar before we
turn in. So bye-bye.
Send Chequey-Bhoy to your own dear Goody-Bhoy, who is now,
as ever,
YOTJB TRUTHFUL REPBESENTATIVE
(In India}.
P.S.—We "ve had a day with the Jugglers. I found out most of
their tricks, and made 'em wild. I was, as I said to my Noble
Friend, "quite in the Juggler V^-" This was received with
screams ana shouts. In fact, every joke of mine tells now, since (I may
say this in confidence) the D-KE OF S-TH-BL-ND has left us; for his
Grace, being such a thorough-going amateur fireman, always went
about as a wet-blanket. This mot was an out-and-out convulser. One
more, and I 've emptied, for the present, my Indian bag of tricks.
The other evening, the DUKE OP BUCKINGHAM came to dine with us.
Before we (His Grace and myself) entered the room, the Duke con-
fided to me that he had recently been photographed, and he pre-
sented me with his portrait. I took it, rushed into the room, my
Noble Friend blanched for one instant, and the suite (thinking it was
tigers) made for the other door. I threw myself into a Kern Vile
attitude, and exclaimed, "My Liege, the DUKE OP BUCKINGHAM is
taken!" My Appreciative Friend s memory coming to his aid, he
took the cue, and returned, "Off with his head!" "Here it
is," said I, presenting the DUKE'S likeness, price sixpence plain, and
a shilling coloured. I haven't time to describe the bursts of merri-
ment that resounded through the Kucker* (Indian for dining saloon)
after this sally.
Yours ever, Y. R. 1.1.
* Kucker in our Dictionary is a "barking deer." This is certainly not
a "dining saloon;" but, on the other hand, as we do not believe in the
existence of a " barking deer," we are the more ready to rely upon our Corre-
spondent's veracity. That boy has not yet returned. "He will return, wo
know him well"—he won't, if he knows us well.—ED.

A FYTTE OF HACKNEY DOWNS.
IT was open walking where Hackney Downs
Lies green beneath the skies,
From a time whereto man's memory
Runneth not contrariwise.
The Lord of the Manor hath made essaye
To enclose and build thereon;
And a blessing upon the Board of Works,
That to law with him have gone!
He planted postes and sett up rayles,
And hedged hym yn the grounde,
The churl mote have waited at least until
He law on hys side had founde.
For the Lord, the Hackney Commoners said,
To collar our common land,
Never sticking so much as to ask our leave,
Ytt ys more than we wyll stand!
What right hath he that land to cribb?
And a curse upon his orown!
No more to set fences and palings up,
Than we have to pull them down.
Soe busk ye, bowne ye. merry men all,
To Hackney Downs hie we,
And let the proud Lord of the Manor know
We can doe as muehe as he.
The Commoners all did wend their way
Unto Hackney Downs eftsoon,
And thereon they met with much folk beside,
On a Saturday afternoon.
Then DE MOBOAN up, and bespake the throng,
The fences that grieved their sight,
As having been reared against the law,
Colde be razed as of right.
They needed not to abide the suit
Which at that time did pende,
'Twixt the Lord of the Manor and Board of Works,
Howsoever that cause might ende.
The Commoners all had rights of their own,
Apart from either side,
To clear those palings and postes away,
From letting them walke and ride.
So forth to those iron rails they went,
To tear them from the land;
When they were 'ware of thirty stout knaves,
Of Bobbies blue a band!
The Bobbies, they drew their good ash staves,
For to guard the railings fain,
But a word their Superintendent spake,
And they putt them up agayne.
Then went the Commoners to their work,
With many an hundred mo,
They seized the fences on Hackney Downs,
And laid the enclosures low.
They tore up and twisted the iron railes
Into whatso shape they wolde:
And eke uprooted the postes of oak
That the iron railes did holde.
The posts had been tarred but just that morn,
From seizing their hands to stay,
All the better therefore dyd the bonfire burn,
Which they made of the wood straightway.
In a trice of fences they cleared the ground,
And the people went to and fro,
Passing free over Hackney Downs once more
Whosoe'er them list to go.
May they only have kept within the Law
These Hackney Commoners true!—
Then hooray for their geste upon Hackney Downs,
And their deed of derring-do 1

THE CYNIC'S CAROL.
CHRISTMAS comes but once a year;
Happy that twice it cometh not:
For sirloin is uncommon dear,
And dear the pudding iu the pot;
And floods are out, and rooms are chill,
And every morning brings a bill.
That plant yclept the mistletoe
To me by no means pleasant is:
My daughters underneath it go
To meet a detrimental kiss,
From one who nothing hath a year,
And liveth in the street called Queer.
My parson preacheth straight at me,
My wine merchant sends claret sour,
My stocks are down to thirty-three,
My stockbroker won't wait an hour;
My boys, escaped scholastic swish,
Take from the larder what they wish.
"Well, life has consolations still:
Locked in my study, far away
From riots that my household fill,
I pass a calm, if cheerless day—
Thankful, as bed-time draweth near.
That Christmas comes but once a year.

and candied peel
in this Christ-
mas-pudding time. These commodities just now are specially
profitable to grocers. Nor these alone. Amongst other good things
your Grocer retails you beverages more or less appropriate to
Christmas fare; notably that "intoxicating liquor," Gladstone,
the variety of Bordeaux for which humble consumers are indebted to
the considerate legislation of the ex-PREitlER, besides other wines,
of home and foreign make, and even spirituous cordials and com-
pounds of more or less alcoholic strength. Rumour has actually
dared to say that an endeavour to arrest the issue of grocers' wine and
spirit licences is meditated by a no less respectable and reasonable
body than the Church of England Temperance Society. This report
is manifestly a canard of the wildest kind—doubtless "a thing
devis edby the enemy ;" perhaps a calumny concocted by certain of
the less scrupulous of our Dissenting brethren. Moderation is the
peculiar merit of the Church of England. The moderation of her
Clergy is known to all men, especially those who aek them to dine,
or are privileged to be their fellow-guests. In drink as well as
doctrine she professes the tia media—Tiolds an even course between
Mynheer van Dunk and ABCTJBISHOP MANNING. To represent the
Church of England Temperance Society as outheroding the United
Kingdom Alliance, Would be to discredit the Church as to her most
cherished virtue, were the bate attempt successful. But the slander
is too absurd.
- Nevertheless it has been as positively as shamelessly asserted that
the Temperance Society of the distinctively moderate Church has
already drafted a Bill for the suspension of the further issue of
Grocers' licences for the sale of " intoxicants," and the suspension,
likewise, of any further issue of public and beerhouse licences until
the limit shall have been reached of one in five hundred of the
population. The names, even, of the Members destined to have
charge of this Bill for weaning the naughty People from their drink-
ing ways, are mentioned—SIR HABCOUBT JOHNSTONE and MR. HUGH
BIBLEY. If these preposterous announcements were true, what lots
of petitions would be got up by short-sighted grocers and publicans
on behalf of a Bill the chief effect of which, if enacted, would be
that of temporarily enriching themselves by a fat monopoly! In
the meanwhile, to be sure, the debates on the Bill in the House of
Commons on Crotchet Day (of course) Wednesday, Wilfrid's-day,
could possibly do no harm. The two Honourable Members above-
named, indeed, would make fools of themselves too, though in
talking to no purpose only, and not at the same time amusing the
House; but still their project of a sumptuary law would afford some
diversion to SIB WILFRID LATVSON'S Permissive Bill.
It is remarkable, though, how extremes meet. Restrictive liquor-
laws are followed, according to their promoters declaiming on the
teetotal platform, by increasing drunkenness. Therefore fanatics
shriek for further legislation in the same spirit of " democratic des-
potism." They roar, as it were, for the drunkard's restorative, "a
hair of the dog that bit you"; their cry, so to speak, is "Pick-me-
up!'
The Church of England Temperance Society, at any rate, needs
not to be told that the licensed grocer's shop is a counter-attraction
to the public-house bar, and that in the former at least no one can
gtt, drunk on the premises, so that it is an utterly false joke to say
that grocers' licences only facilitate a grosser kind of intoxication.

MARY ANNER ON MODES AND MISSISES.

UKCH read, only last week,
that—
"Attempts are being made
to revive a Society started
some time ago with the object of induc-
ing women of all ranks to discard such
fashions as are injurious to health, un-
graceful, and untrue. It is now pro-
posed to re-organise the Society upon
a broader basis, and to set to work in
earnest. The prevailing love of finery
evinced by female domestic servant*
is to be taken in hand, and awards in
money are to be offered as encourage-
ment to servant-girls to dress more
suitably to their stations in life."—
Daily 'Telegraph, Dec. 21st, 1875.
DEAR SUSAN JANE,
You 'VE heard, no doubt,
of this Association
For making people dress their-
selves according to their sta-
tion;
"Which what they sez they 're aim-
ing at is putting of a stopper
On fashions as is 'stravagant, or
hurtful or improper.
~hli'fc«.»vi<. Well, / 'm agreeable, I 'm sure-
thai is,—to quote them law-
yers,—
"Purwided always" 'tain't no trick of Fashion's she-top-sawyers,
To keep hits down! /know their ways: theirselves they will bedizen,
But seeing servants smart and trim's a thin$ they hates like pizen!
That's why I seem to smell a rat, dear SUE, in this Society,
As these " awards in money " is, I fear, a neat wariety
Of "trap;" which toasted cheese is nice, and cash, no doubt, is nicer,
But we 're too sharp, I reckon, to be caught by such a 'ticer.
Encourage Servant-Girls to dress as suits their situation t
0 yes, I dessay! Very fine! I 've heard that observation
A goodish many times before, from lips of lots of Missises
As though nice toggery weren't for all, the same as food and kisses is 1
Which service ain't no 'eritage at best, but plague upon it
If a girl can't have a sweetheart, or a Sunday-best smart bonnet.
It's all their nasty jealousy! There's Missis and her darters,
A plainer lot you never see, red-nosed,! and
reglar Tartars !—
But dress, 0 my I just don't they! Which
Miss HARABELLA—drat her!
Would give her little finger for a shape—
but there, no matter;
Though that absurd JOHN TOJIMAH do
declare as mv contooer,
Compared with HAXABELLA'S, is as Wenus
to a brewer;
And CAPTRN BHOOK, as she 'opes to hook
with eyes as ain't a pair,
Sez, as he tipped me handsome—well,
that's neither here nor there.
But 0 the shindies I 've gone through, the
dodges, SUE, the fibbings,
Along of trumpery trifles in the.way of
caps and ribbings!
Which nothing short of charity rig, mob-
caps and straight-down skirts,
Will satisfy some Missises. Which they
flings, and flaunts, and flirts
Like peacocks or them Flaming Goes as
you 've seen, dear, at the Zoo,—
Which gaudy ain't the word, as mast be
well-be-known to you,—
While tee must go to see the play, or ramble
in the Parks,
Like dowdies out of workusses or children's
Noah's-Arks!
Just wearing my new fixhyou V other
evening in the garden
(The sweetest thing you ever see at four-
mil-tenpence farden!)
So aggrawated our Miss JAKE (as hers
might be its fellar,
Though dearer), her complexion, I swear,
went blue and yellow.
Sez she, "Take oft that thing, I beg I"
Sez I, "Make no mistake, Miss,
Taint one o' youm, though simmylar, I
own, in style and make, Miss.
I "d not demean ." I 'm sure a Queen
could not have cut me shorter.
And I 've my serious doubts if I remains
beyond the quarter.
I calls this right down tyranny; and this,
my dearest SUE,
Is why I takes my pen in hand to write
these lines to you.
This here new move, yon mark my word, 's
a mask for something artful;
But they won't tempt me to play the Nun
with prizes by the oartf all.
To put us into uniform's their game; dear
SUE, don't heed 'em,
But let us Servants all unite, and stick up
for pur freedom.
^"Missises hates "finery," they've only
got to drop it,
But bribing Servant-girls they'll find is
not the way to stop it.
If they 'd have us laugh at Fashion, let 'em
set us the example,
Before they frowns at our fal-lals, and on
our feelin's trample.
No! "Sunday Best for Ever!" is the
motto for our banner.
Down with Mob-caps and Missises!
Tours truly,
MART ANNKK.
NOT TO BE WONDERED AT.
WE hear that stringent orders have been
issued by the Admiralty that no Mistletoe
is to be allowed among the Christmas de-
corations of the ships now in the Solent.
SEASONABLE HINT.
THE person likely to feel warmest at this
time of year is the man who is not
thoroughly wrapped up in himself.

A SWEEPING REFORM.
SOUR dissatisfaction having been expressed with regard to the
efficiency of our Street-sweepers, the Metropolitan _ Vestries have
determined upon instituting Competitive Examinations, in which
the following questions will be put, among others:—
1. Can you lean on a broom or a shovel P
2. Can you look up and down a street P
3. Can you chew tobacco?
4. Can you converse fluently with other sweepers on the topics of
the day P
5. Would you feel capable, during your moments of leisure from
the above-named occupations, of sweeping the mud in the street out
of the way of horses and carriages, and into the way of foot-
passengers, and to such a depth and width as would preclude ladies
and children from crossing the street P
6. Do you think you could remember to construct the largest and
most deceptive mud-pies and puddings midway between the gas-
lamps, so that, in the semi-darkness, persons might plunge both feet
in them before knowing where they are going?
These questions being satisfactorily answered in the affirmative,
an old broom (not a new one—the latter being proverbial for sweep-
ing clean} will be presented to the candidate, and on the first fine
dry, windy day he will be set to work to sweep dust into the eyes of
a suffering public.

[JANUARY 1, 1876.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
In view of Christmas-Day—Jovialities—Festivities — Minulice—
Specialities-" All there!"

SIB,—I write in haste, so that you may have the first news of
outmost recent doings. I have no doubt but that there •will be
various accounts of our proceedings, but believe me that mine is the
only genuine one. "CODLLN 's the man—not SHORT."
You should hear my new Songs. One commences thus :—
"Merrily, merrily do wo live now
Under the mango that bangs on the bough."
The copyright is still for sale: early application necessary, as I
have already refused twenty lacs (or lakhs) of rupees from SIB UAO
BEBBI JAM JEE JELLYBHOY, and thirty from MIBZA Id \i FOOZLAH,
the latter of whom prides himself on his tenor voice; but, bless you,
he " cannot sing the old songs" any more than his rivals, the Grate
YASZEJEE, the LYTJN-KOHMEKEE, or SIB JOLLEJE NASHBHOT.*
My latest Conundrum is going the round of all the Indian circles,
and the natives are in fits. It is, "When may rupees be considered
as 'loose cash' "? My Illustrious Companion made twenty-five
guesses, and then offered me a Baronetcy and the Star of India if I
would tell him privately. But I wouldn't. "Rupees," I answered,
before an admiring crowd of Ram-jams, Rajahs, and such like.
"Rupees may be considered as 'loose cash' when they are looked
upon as Lax." Whereupon I bowed, and retired. Delirious
laughter, and shouts of delight. I returned, and again bowed.
You may not be aware that my Illustrious Companion invariably
goes about with a Gold Umbrella. It was found necessary to distin-
guish him in this manner, as it was so awkward for me always to
be explaining who Ac was, and who I wasn't. The Rajahs, the
Nizams, the Mahranas, and so forth, used invariably to come up to
me first, and insist upon presenting me with diamonds, yataghans,
zem-zems, and richly-caparisoned elephants, which, out of courtesy,
I felt obliged to give up, saying, jocosely (in Hindostanee, of course)
"No, no, my dear Maharajah (or Rajah, or whoever it might be),
"it's not me—it's t'other boy." My Noble and Disinterested
Friend and myself arrange the shares afterwards; and so I shall
have a magnificent Collection ready for exhibition at the Egyptian
Hall, with a panorama, some songs, and, altogether, a first-rate
entertainment, for next Easter. 1 make you the first offer. I '11
take a hundred a week, and twenty-five per cent, of the profits.
Eh?
I had—I mean my Illustrious co-Shooter and myself had—some
fine iport the other day. There is a curious ornithological specimen
here. It is rare, but not absolutely uncommon. It emigrates to
India from Ireland at certain seasons, and is called the "Paddy
Bird." It possesses few notes; and as it belongs to the species
"Mocking-Bird" of the genui " Parrot," no doubt it has picked up
and brought to this country many of the words peculiar to its
own native land. Its cry is generally plaintive, and it may be
heard any morning early, uttering such sounds as "Ochone!
Worra, worra! Bedad!" and so forth. When challenging another
cook-bird, it sings out, clearly and distinctly, "Will ye tread on
the tail of my feathers?" And, on being mortally wounded, it
falls with a wild shriek of "Whoop! Ould Oireland for iver 1"
* The quoition with ue at this moment is, are these real Indian names of
real genuine Indian magnates, or are they not? A young friend very much
about town just now, wishes to insinuate that, under a thin veil of Indian
terminology he recognises the names of well-known London vocalists. Any
light that can be thrown by our well-informed readers on this subject, will be
taken as a great service rendered to the public and to ourselves. Our boy bos
not yet returned with the new Indian Dictionary. It must be a difficult thing
to find, as he has been absent from our office for nearly three wetks.—ED.
We managed to shoot three of these Paddy Birds, and I am only
astonished that, with these remarkable characteristics, we have not
heard more of them from English ornithologists.
It is wonderful how coming abroad expands the mind. Merely
going to the Zoological Gardens three times during the London
Season is, comparatively, of very little use.
Last Sunday afternoon, to amuse my Estimable and Appreciative,
but by now somewhat blast, Companion, I engaged in single combat
with an elephant, a rhinoceros, two rams, and a buffalo. Of course
I soon settled them all—one down, t'other come on; so I will not
enter into details, which would be scarcely interesting to my fair
readers.
We visited, the other day, the little pity of Mukkipoora, the
streets of which, after a heavy rain, were in a dreadful state. The
Governor, COLOBEL THE HON. RETCHIDWBTIIKR, MA.TOK SLUSHING-
TOK, MIBZA MCDPIZA (the eminent banker), and Sin SLOSHEF. DHYB-
TETBHOT entertained our party at the Downpore Club. We had a
wet evening of it, I warrant you; and it was with great difficulty
that we managed to collect our hats and umbrellas in the hall.
COLONEL RETCBIDWETHEB tried to see my Distinguished Friend and
myself to the hall-door: but in consequence of his seeing two Dis-
tinguished Friends and two Myselfs, he somehow managed to
conduct the wrong party, cannoned against a swing-door, and dis-
appeared head first—his boots in the air, and an apology in his
mouth. Being unhurt, and the carpet soft, he remained there till,
I believe, next day. Long before this, SIB SLOSHJEE and MUDDI-
PIZA had disappeared under the table. I regret to say that we were
compelled to put up the following notice in the hall:—" Any gentle-
man having taken, by mistake for his own, the Oold Umbrella
belonging to H.R.H., is hereby requested to return it to the hall-
porter without delay."
In the meantime I 've lent my Noble Companion my own, just to
go on with, but not to go off with. This interchange of more than
brotherly amenities binds us by a still closer tie. I am loyal to the
back-bone; and, a propos of my umbrella, to the whalebone.
Did I give you an account of our going to see the Guikwar P Here
it is—in brief. He was gorgeously attired, his proboscis was fan-
tastically massive, rings encircled his legs, and his ears were stained
of a pale yellowish colour. His head was coloured saffron, his tusks
were sawn off and blunted, and his attendants were dressed to
match.*
The usual way of getting on to an elephant's back is to be lifted
up by small Native Hoisters. I, as an old hand, discard all assist-
ance, and, taking a short run at the brute's head, leap on to his
tusk, and with another bound I am on his back. Of course this
requires practice, and my Royal and otherwise Accomplished
Friend has not had the time to acquire my skill and efficiency. The
consequence is, that he rather worries a mettlesome elephant in getting
on to bis back; and, as he is invariably in uniform, u-Hh spurs on,
the consequences are in some instances likely to be fraught with
some danger. "Thgit dloh!" cried the Natives, as, on feeling the
tickling of the spurs on his sensitive hide, the high-couraged Guik-
war gave such a heave of his back, and such a lash out with his
bind legs, as caught SIB PIIOBTYSTUK JBLLYBHOY just as he was in
a salaaming position, with his back to the elephant, and his turban
towards myself, and sent him flying over my head as if he had been
discharged from his office liy a catapult of sixty-four horse-power.
Poor old JELLYBHOY! He is no longer a young man, and this
sudden surprise must have taken ten years off his life. My Illus-
trious Friend kept his seat wonderfully, and away we cantered, he
on the Guikwar, and myself on a white elephant (which really
required riding), while the Nizzars brayed, the drums beat, the
cymbals clanged: and so we rode to dinner. After the banquet,
one of the native Butties ran in from Mukkipoora (thirteen miles
off), to say that he had brought the Prince's umbrella, and asked
For two thousand kutwdah (a kind of fourpenny bit), and fifty
Maungees (amounting to about three shillings and two-pence and
three-eighths) as a reward for his trouble and honesty.t. My Gene-
rous and Royal Companion at once turned to me, and said. Give it
iim." I laughed, and replied, in Hindostanee, "Ton rof hpesoj I"
for I am not a millionnaire, and it's these small sums that break the
camel'si back,}; C-B-NGT-N had to fork out; he has always got
what the Indians term " Sparecashee" about him, and so we sent out
* Surely, turely, there must be some mistake here. The Guikwar, as
everyone knows, is a little Indian princely boy—not an eltphcmt, as our
Correspondent seems to infer. Either this is carelessness, or—or Yet if
our Correspondent be on the spot, he mat have means of knowing what
a Guikwar really it, which we in this country do not possess. We arc un-
willing to judge harshly or hastily: audi alterant partem is our motto.—ED.
t In the continued absence of the boy with the Dictionary, we oan only
ascertain, from our former source of information, that Eutu-ual i( a " polioe-
man," not "a kind of fourpenny bit;" and that Maungcf means "a boat-
swain." Odd!-Eo.

be a curious example of an undesigned coincidence.—ED.

a handsome present to the honest Suttee hy ADMIBAL McHAGGia,
who presently returned, and, in a violent rage, produced an old
broken gingham, which the rascal (after having collared the money,
and bolted) had left tied up in a large parcel in the hall.

he likes, and no one better: and MK. NUHSEBBI RYMJEE is singing
"Little Jack Homer" in order to keep young PEINCE NANABY

that he 'd never been born.

INUNDATIONS.

PUBLIC characters complain
severely of having been
inundated by requests
for autographs.
Householders complain of
their letter-boxes being in-
undated by trade circulars.
Governors of
Charitable In-
stitutions say
that they are in-
undated by ap-
plications on be-
half of all sorts
of impracticable
cases.
Theatrical
Managers com-
plain of being
daily inundated
by requests for
free admissions
from people who
haven't the
slightest
to them.
Editors
Papers
plain of
claim
of
cnm-
heing
inundated by torrents of useless Correspondence. The complaints
of the Editor of P /> are bitter. His time is taken up in at-
tempts to decipher ill-written MSS. which are worthless when
deciphered, and his sanctum is inundated by a flood of old jukes
and stale witticisms.
Last week everybody worth anything to anyhody was inundated
by calls for Christmas-boxes. These Inundations have been accom-
panied by a tremendous Inundation of Christmas bills, which is
likely, we fear, to spread itself all over the country. Those whom
Providence has not blessed with affluence, would find Boulogne a
pleasant place of resort during these terrible Christmas Inundations
at home.
MILITARY INTELLIGENCE.
SORE—MISTUKB PDNCH,
SEE here now what LOUD DEBBY said the other day in
Edinburgh:—
"It is easy to point to the estimates of forty years ago, and to draw invidious
contrasts. But forty years ago an able-bodied Irishman thought himself
liberally paid at a shilling a day; and no wonder then that you could get
soldiers and sailors cheap.
Chape, is it? Yes, bedad. To go a sodgerin' or a sailorin', and
run the risk of being say-sick, or mayhap of being shot at, for only
a shillin' a day, bedad it 'a making human flesh and blood as chape
as cat's-meat. Ye see, forty year ago PAT was a pore divil, and
emigration—blessings on it!—wornt invinted. Besides, provisions
thin were chape, and so was food for powdther. But, thanks to
'Merriky and Melbourne. PATJDY knows the value of his able body
now-a-days, and won't let it go a sodgerin' for a'most next to
nothin'. Ye see, when butcher's mate is asy sellin' at a shillin' a
pound, a boy ud be a goose to let himself he hought for on'y a
shillin' a day, with the chance of being shot at or transfigured by a
baynit. Forty year ago, PAT could live like a fighting-cock upon no
betther pay than that, becase thin butcher's mate was chape—
anny way he niver tasted it. But, in the present march of intelleck,
a sodger couldn't think of living on pitaties.
Yours humbly to command,
PHIL. FOGOAHTY,
Ex- Corporal of the Fighting Onety- Oneth.
Men in their Places.
AN opinion is gaining ground that the office of First Lord of the
Admiralty, to be efficiently discharged, requires to be filled by a
Naval Officer possessing the professional knowledge necessary for
its due performance. It may be hoped that the change thus sug-
gested will not be made without some endeavour to ascertain
whether the practice which it is proposed to depart from does not, in
fact, work as well as possible. Suppose we try the converse of it to
teat the point. When the next opportunity presents itself, let us
select a distinguished Admiral, not to preside over naval affairs, but
to be Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Here'» the Year's first daughter, Spring.
Dear delicious morning hours,
White hands wet with April (lowers;
Not a thought for dolt or zealot,
Valentine the ruling prelate:
Spring, with myriad odours shed—
Of bud from burgeon, flower from bed!
Lo, the air with perfume fills
Of hyacinths and daffodils.
Now's the day
For love and play.
Thrush's song!
Nightingales the woods among—
Perfect blue at happy noon,
When the Summer seems to swoon;
Sunsets when the colour rushes
Into many million blushes;
Night so still that love's own star
From our dull earth seems not far;
Sunrises divinely yellow—
Prithee stop, poetic fellow,
Whom day's peep
Finds still asleep.
Leaves float down:
Autumn wears her wondrous crown.
Gay the trample o'er the heather,
Gay the time we spend together,
Friends, who let life's troubles go
For a merry month or so.
Autumn brings the " happy thought,"
From decaying radiance caught,
That there is for toilers here
Summer in a wider sphere.
Leaves float slow!
Love doth not go.
Snow and ice!
Take wise HORACE'S advice.
Let the mighty Yule-log glow,
On holly and on mistletoe,
Under whose benignant cluster,
Christmas pairs for kisses muster!
So the year is round again,
Peace and war, and sun and rain,
Love and marriage, death and birth,
Fun and fancy, tears and mirth,—
Heaven knows what—but may we be,
Coming year, by aid of thee,
Nearer Heaven
In Seventy-Seven!

A GOOD SOUL.
A HANDSOME Christmas-Box, in the shape of £1,200 raised by
nendly subscription, has been presented to MB. JOSEPH SOUL. Mm
isouL, who is not well, and.has a Wife and Daughter to maintain,
is well known as having acted as the Secretary of more than one
Jbaritable Institution in the Metropolis." Chiefly by the exer-
ions of MB. SOUL, the sum of £20,000 had, it was mentioned by
he Gentleman who handed him the merited testimonial, "been
wpcured on behalf of one particular Charity. He might also be
aid to be the founder of the Alexandra Orphanage for Infants and
he Convalescent Home at Margate." This Soul appears to have
een the life as well as soul of many charitable institutions. He has
well earned his Christmas-Box of £1,200; but that, though a
landsome one, is, it may be remembered, with three SOTOS to sup-
port, money enough to go some way only towards keeping body and

SEASONABLE JOTTINGS.
THB designs for Christmas Cards, preserved in the Ambrosial
Library at Milan, by the Old Masters, particularly those by COBPO
DI BACCO, DOLCE FAB NIENTE, PIETBO PUNCHINELLO. FBA SOBAP-
FITO, and VILLEQOIATCBA, show no indications of plum-pudding,
holly, or turkey, and only in one or two (by Poco CUBANTE) are
there any signs of snow and icicles.
It is both interesting and instructive (especially for those young
persons home for the holidays who may be detained in-doors through
stress of weather) to trace back to the fountain-head one or two
of the phrases which are everywhere current at this festive season.
"Christmas comes but once a year" is claimed for several writers
of antiquity by their respective partisans; but it is hardly worth
while to discuss the question, for the Author, whoever he was, must
have been a man of singularly contracted views, not to see that his
aphorism has no special reference to Christmas, but applies equally
to Lent, Michaelmas, the Battle of Marengo, Mr. Punch's birth-
day, and all other great anniversaries. The cheery good wish, " A
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year," has been ascribed to
BONIFACE and also to 111 I.AKY, but it is older than either or both of
them. Uttered from time immemorial between the twenty-fifth of
December and the sixth of January, it may be traced back in illu-
minated MSS. and palimpsests, in venerable scrolls and papyri,
through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the Invention of
Learning and the Revival of Printing, till it is finally lost in the
darkness which preceded the dawn of Gothic Architecture in the
Byzantine Empire. "What seasonable weather!" That distin-
guished philologist, Vow Si'iiAcii EH/UNOE, gives a list of seventy-
six languages, and one hundred-and-eleven dialects, in which this
well-known'formula occurs, extending from 196° 28' N. to 47* 195' 8.
The Christmas-Tree was first introduced into this country from
the Black Forest by a German Band. Some harmless superstitions
hide themselves amongst its branches. It should be dug up with a
silver (certainly with an electro-plated) spade, by a distant relation,
between the hours of 8 P.M. and 8 A.M., and removed, carefully
wrapped in silver paper, in a cylindrical pot of vermilion hue, by
four of the best girls in the next charity-school, wearing duffle bon-
nets trimmed with green ribbon, long yellow mittens, short red
petticoats, and blue worsted stockings. If possible, a deputation
from the nearest School Board, with their Beadles, should be invited
to the exhibition of the Tree, and little appropriate gifts handed to
them by anyone present who has passed the Oxford (or Cambridge)
Local Examination. The Lady, having an establishment of her own,
who receives the last present from a Christmas-Tree, may confidently
look forward to one of three things happening in the course of the
New Year—either the roasting-jaok will get out of order, or the
housemaid will give warning, or there will be a fracture of crockery
in the kitchen.
On New Year's Eve it is considered very lucky if yon d|eam that
you are at a Fancy Dress Ball at the Bank of England.
On New Year's Day, if the post arrives before you are down to
breakfast, you will receive during the year a list of prices from a
wine-merchant, patterns from a tailor, and the announcement of
the purchase of a bankrupt draper's stock and its unreserved sale at
55 per cent, below cost price. If, on the other hand, you are seated at
the breakfast-table when the letters are delivered, twelve months will
not elapse without your receiving a pressing solicitation to subscribe
to the Grand National State Lottery of Boshnia, a card with the
prices (up to the latest possible moment) of the best Wallsend,
Silkstone, and Derby Brights, and a cordial invitation to dine (at
your own expense) with the Patrons, Stewards, and Supporters of
the Hospital for the Relief and Cure of Diseases of the Midriff,
supported entirely by voluntary contributions.
Never make your Will on Old Christmas Day (Twelfth Day).

necessary forms, and paying the necessary fees) at the Registry,

TERENCE AT WESTMINSTER.
f*0w a night not long ere Christmas Day,
DOCTOR PUNCH, who is sapiens et vajer,
Taken the book of the very first play
Of PtTBLlUS TKHliNTIUS AFER:
He looks at the Westminster hoys,
Judges, big-wigs, and ladies in satin,
Then, ere fact all illusion destroys,
He buries his nose in the Latin.
Good stuff, 0 TEBENTI! Although
It is not a critical slander
To say, that We very well know.
That you borrowed your plot from
MFNANDEH.
But are tee not borrowers too?
Why the critics are raving in'chorus
That nought now-a-days can be new,
Since the Ancients were authors before
us.
Be it so. Let our wine and our wit
Be famed, if you will, for antiquity:
But why should that lessen a whit
Our enjoyment of Dams' iniquity?
Not, though, while the best fun s astir,
Our neighbour, SIR MABK MEGATHE-
RIUM,
Says, "The play has no heroine, Sir!
Where the deuce have they hidden
Gly cerium?"
"Play without' leading lady.'—too bad!"
Verdant Greens in loud protest may
mutter,
Who for stage-sirens go to the bad,
On the shoal where short petticoats
flutter.
For their sake Mr. Punch must declare
That our stage would be often less
quizzible,
If the heroine, foolish as fair.
Could all through the play be invisible.
The Actress her "h's " who drops,
The Actress who shrieks in her passion,
The Actress who won't mind her stops,
The Actress who will set the fashion;
Just think of them, playwright of nous,
And say is't not very much safer
To shut the sweet thing in her house.
As did PUBLICS TEHBSTIUS AFER?
BIRDS AND BONNETS.
ONK of those evils which work their own cure will, it is to he
hoped, prove to be the present barbarous fashion of wearing 'little
birds or portions of them as trimmings of bonnets. In "Fashions
for December" Le Pallet announces that: —
"The birds and wings are getting very common, and are superseded in the
bonnets made by fashionable modistes by long plumes and curled feathers.
As many of these can be supplied from one victim, the small ornithological
species muat be very grateful for this new decree of Fashion."
By "getting common," Le Pallet means that cookrobins, gold-
finches, and tomtits, have commenced appearing in the head-dresses
adopted by the wives and daughters of small tradesmen, and by
servant girls, whence again they will disappear in due time after
they have been "superseded in the bonnets made by fashionable
modistes" for the superior classes. Thus all orders of the sex
will, in succession, figure as feather-headed, but, in succession,
we trust, to return to less objectionable trimmings and humaner
head-gear.
In the meantime Punch grieves to learn that, so far from this
being the case as yet, the Chairman of the Avon and Stour Far-
mers Club has lately brought under the notice of the Club a new
cruelty springing from the same source—viz., the plucking out the
wings and feathers of birds while still alive, the offenders in their
defence averring that the feathers were more valuable when so
plucked, as longer retaining their natural hue.
BAHONKSS BuBDBTT-CouTTS has been on the </ui vive, as usual, in de-
fence of her poor little feathered friends, and writes to the Secretary
of the Club a letter which Punch is glad to reprint in exterao: —
"Sin, "Heron Court, Dee. 19th.
"PLEASE convey to the members of your excellent society the sense of
pleasure it gave me to learn that there was an unanimous desire on their part
to put down the cruelty which hai been extensively practised in this and
other districts, in wantonly killing, and (as I learn from the ChrUtchurch
paper of the 1st inst.) actually torturing small birds. That three men should
be charged with plucking the wings and feathers of these moat harmless of all
God's creatures while still alive seems incredible at this period of the nine-
teenth century; but as it appears that these feathers are intended for the
adornment of Ladies' attire, it is time that the sense of Englishwomen should
be quickened to the enormity of the crime which they are virtually encouraging.
I have already communicated with many of the leaders of fashion in this
country on the subject, but, in a truly sympathetic letter I received from
MADAMB LOUISE I am grieved to learn that, repugnant to womanly feeling
as this kind of decoration should be, there is still an increasing demand for it.
English Ladies will incur a serious responsibility, and gain an unenviable
reputation, unless they discard a practice attended with so much pain and
cruelty as this ia now shown to be. „ BUHDBTT-COUTTS."
JUSTICE .TO A HEAD-MASTER.
Off "Speech Day" a^ Highbury College the usual festivities
were observed in Highbury New Park in the presence of some two
hundred Ladies and Gentlemen.
"BISHOP CLAUOHTON took the chair, and proceeded to the presentation of
the prizes, making some excellent remarks commendatory of DR. KIMMO and
bis staff of masters, who had, during the put twenty years, imparted so sound
an education to so many pupils."
Here, now, was just the right man in the right place, saying just
the right thing. No one, perhaps, is better qualified to appreciate
the services of a Head-Master who has creditably conducted a Public
School for the last twenty years, than BISHOP CLAUGHTON. Recently
published correspondence and rtmarks have probably impressed him
with a sense of such services, which, had he oeen endowed with it a
little sooner, would have enabled him to do justice to the Head-
Master of Felstead School, MR. GBIGNON.

PUNCH'S ALMANACKS.
S Mr. Punch
has of late been
compelled to
undergo the
perusal of
many Alma-
nacks (in the
preparation of
his own incomparable
one), he has been
painfully struck by
the amount of stupi-
dity shown' in their

<if course, his own
incomparable one).
The average almanack
reads like the follow-
ing :—

.1. Smith b. 1807
loseph Miller d.

Til Dividends due

1491
Win. Bloggins d.

Now who wants to know when the sun rises, or who, if he does
know it, will get up to tee it? Does not every schoolboy know that
JOHN SMITH was burn in 1807? Is anyone so disgracefully ignorant
as not to be aware when JOSEPH (familiarly called JOE) MILLKR
departed this life 'r1 If anyone has irot any dividends, trust him for
knowing when they are due; and if he hasn't got any, what is the
use of tantalising him? Does any one require to be informed when
Jamaica was discovered, and is there any one so lost to all sense of
decency and shame that he dues not know that WILLIAM BLOGGINS
died in 1CS3?
Mr. Punch, true to his one great instinct of benefiting mankind in
every possible manner, ha» devised and patented a new series of
Almanacks, which will meet everybody's wants. He subjoins a few
specimens, leading the years blank till he has time to consult his

NAVAL KUHSERY BHYMES.
A KKCENT public speaker is reported to have said that the way in
which the Navy is now managed is " positively childish." If this
be true, our Sailors may in some sort be looked upon as children,
and scarce out of the nursery; and, this being so, they may perhaps
find some amusement in such nursery rhymes as these :—

When the wind blows, safe ashore you should btop:
Ere you awake there '11 perhaps come a squall,
And down may go Iron-clads, sailors and all.

Ah, yes, precisely so, of leaking valves 'tis full.

And what on earth they "re wanted for no fellow well can learn.

For repairs when he forks out the cash.

And see that your whistles are ready to scream.
For fear of a leak your fog-signals prepare.
But don't start till the weather-glass stand* at Set Fair.

On a perfectly calm morning from Spithead, head, head:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A HAPPY NEW YEAR.

IT was 11.30 P.M., on the night of the 31st December, 1875.
Punch sate in front of his study-fire, thinking over the events
of the past year: Toby lay at full length on the hearth-rug,
lazily watching the hands of the clock. Near Punch was a
play-bill, recalling the glories of a Pantomime he had seen on
Boxing-night, and the room was gay with mistletoe and holly.
The window-curtains were drawn back, BO that not a moment
might he lost in throwing up the gash to let in the first clash
of the bells proclaiming the birth of 1876.
"It's over at last!" murmured Punch, dreamily. "What
a number of events crowded into three hundred and sixty-five
days! Capital notion for a Pantomime—A Review of the
Year's Events. Splendid Transformation Scenes! Lots of'em!"
And Punch would certainly have fallen fast asleep had he not
suddenly found himself preternaturally wide awake, Toby,
strange to say, was endowed with human speech.
"You must see them, Master," said the Dog of Dogs; "many
of them have come a long way to pay their respects to you; and some of them / have ordered round to receive from you the rating
they deserve."

Here Toby suddenly began singing with great feeling, " Ood Bleu

and prepossessing appearance, walked up to his Master.
"Don't rise, I beg," said the young Oentlemon, with a pleasant
smile; "I hate ceremony. I came to tell you that I like India

most courtly air. "Every day brings us news of the good im-

in the way of sport, that occurs to him, or to me?"
"_Yes, Sir, I have," replied Punch, smiling; "and his contri-
butions, if yon will permit me to say so, are infinitely better fun
than the regular thing in the morning papers. I trust we shall soon
see your Royal Highness at home again?
"I hope to be back in March." said H.R.H. "In the meantime
allow me to wish you the compliments of the season, in my popular
character of the Traveller of the Year."
He was gone, and suddenly his place was taken by a Gentleman
whose face was as a book, where men might read strange matters.
"Got through the year without losing my seat on the Treasury
Bench, you see," said the new-comer, with a smile full of sarcastic,
though serious, meaning.
"You have been very lucky," replied Punc h, drily; "for the
Session was mismanaged from beginning to end."
"Pini* coronat opui.' Who thinks of the Merchant Shipping
Bill, or of all poor WARD HUNT'S Admiralty messes, with the Suez
Canal Purchase fresh in his recollection? May I bow to you in the
character of the Success of the Year?"
But before Punch could frame an answer, the RIGHT HONOURABLE
BEN.IAMIN'S place was occupied by a sham Sailor. Toby growled
savagely, and the ontwardly sea-faring man seemed to yaw and
shift uneasily under the steady gaze of Punch,
"Who are you?" asked the Sage.
"I hail from the Admiralty," growled the young Salt.
"Off with you!" cried Punch, angrily; "the sooner we forget
the Blunders and Mishaps of the Year the better." Straight the
place of that anything but Ancient Mariner was filled by two Sailors
of a very different stamp. The first was a stalwart man, his suit of
rough fear-nought stiff with ice and heavy with snow; the second a
lad, on whose clothes and hair had passed the scathing blast of fire.
The man had come all the way from the North Pole, the lad only
a few miles, from the burnt and blackened skeleton of the Goliath
Training Ship.
"Not a word, my friends; not a word!" cried Punch, enthusiasti-
cally; "the Heroes of the Year require no introduction."
Then two more Seafaring Men appeared. One wore a strange
waterproof dress stuck over with advertisements; the other stood
modestly forth, a man every inch of him, in puris naturalibui.
"CAPTAIN WEBB, your hearty admirer!" said Punch. "CAPTAIN
BOYION, your obedient servant I In what character do I see you here?"
"The Sensations of the Year," whispered T«ly.
"But with a difference," added Mr. Punch, toito voce, as the
swimmers passed on.
And now two Ladies appeared, the first leaning on crutches, the
second chiefly remarkable for her fine clothes, her bird-plumed
toque, and a savage expression disfiguring a countenance naturally
refined.
"I am sorry to see you in this condition," said Punch to his dis-
abled Lady-visitor.
"A victim to the Skating Rink," sighed the interesting cripple.
"The Rage of the Year/' commented Toby.
"And you, Madam," continued Punch, turning to the second
Lady, "to what do I owe the honour of your visit?"
"I want your influence, my dear Mr. Punch. I have the run of
the Old Bailey when there is anything very interesting at the
Central Criminal. If you would only take me to see a private exe-
cution, my happiness would be complete. I see you are looking at
the plume in my hat. Beautiful—isn't it? So bright! Picked
from the live bird, you know!—a great discovery!"
"I know," said Punch with a shudder; "you are the Horror of
the Year." And as the two Ladies disappeared, he added, "That
graceful ghoule has given me a turn. I will see no more."

"Then there are three Foreigners in diplomatic uniform who wish

"The Scandal of the Year! Come, come, this is quite enough
The levee grows depressing; I will see no more."
Toby would have expostulated further, when suddenly there cami
a pattering of fairy feet, and the sound of joyous laughter.
Punch was attacked on all sides by a bevy of beautiful girls
They shook hands with him, they kissed, they cuddled, they hugged
In a twinkling he was their helpless prisoner. Over his head whizzed,
lasso-like, the matrimonial noose; his wrists bound faster thai

fashion, about his ankle.
"The Penalty of Leap Year," they laughed out in the intervals
of their kisses: "1875 has given place to 1876!"
At this moment Toby began to bark so loud that Punch sud-
denly awoke. He rubbed his eyes, and looked up at the clock
The hands were on the stroke of twelve.
Toby rushed to the window. Punch followed leisurely • and as the
cool night air poured into the room, and the bells of the City clashec
the solemn hour of midnight, there came a joyous burst of far-of
music.

my good creature, bear in mind, that, while the Government under
which I serve " desires to mitigate the horrors of slavery," yet "Her
Majesty's ships are not intended for the reception of persons other
than their officers and crew," and here we are. Her Majesty's
ships, in fact, resemble omnibuses or cabs, or any other public con-
veyance, being licensed to carry so many, and no more. Therefore,
you will, I am sure, see the necessity of my satisfying myself that
there is sufficient ground for taking you on board, before I can
accommodate you with a rope.

you have not yet satisfied me as to whether, even if you are what
youprofess tobe, i.e., a Fugitive Slave, you have been "detained in a
state of slavery contrary to existing treaties." You should recollect
that, as representing the British Government, I am "bound by the

THE BURNING OF THE
GOLIATH.
(At told by an old Gravesend Salt to a Messmatt
in Greenwich Hospital.)
A DIBIT, foggy morning 'twas:
Grays loomed large, close a-lee:
The watch was holy-stoning decks
As white as decks could be:
There were five hundred workhouse lads
A training for the sea.
Qnhalh was a giant-hulk
Built in the days of yore:
And more than one small DAVID
Upon her books she bore.
No iron in her: knees of oak,
And oak-heart at the core.
The bell had just struck half-past eight,
As broke the winter's day—
On the main-deck 'twas dousing glims
And stowing them away.
Darn that new-fangled paraffine !—
Whale-ile 's the stuff, I say!
Young LofiBm had the lamps in charge—
A steady boy, I 'm told—
One on 'em burnt his fingers, till
He couldn't keep his hold;
Down fell the lamp; along the decks
The blazing oil it rolled.
"Fire!" "Beat to quarters!" "Man
the pumps! "—
I conld cry like a fool
To read how them lads mustered all,
As if for morning school.
In their sky-larking at Christmas
They wasn't half as cool.
I 've heerd of Balaclava—
Bat those were bearded men,
And theae were little fellows,
Most part 'twixt twelve and ten.
Some calls 'em gutter-children—
God bless our gutters, then!
The Capt'n he was at his post,
A smile upon his face;
And not one officer or lad
Bat knew and kept his place.
Though soon 'twas plain as plain could be,
The fire must win the race.
Most of the little chaps could swim;
But, swim or not, they made
And kept their lines as regular
As soldiers on parade.
BOTTCHIER had wife and girls aboard—
But by them lads he stayed.
Till when the pumps no longer sucked,
Boat-tackles scorched, in-board:
Ship lost 1 No lowering the boats!
The Captain gave the word,
"Leap from the ports: swim, them that
can;
The rest, trust in the Lord!"
One little chap hung round his neck
A blubb'ring, "Burnt you '11 be.
Jump over first—and then we 'It jump."
"No, no, my boy," says he.
"The Skipper's last to leave the ship—
That is our way at sea."
So young and old their duty did,
Like sailors, and like men:
There was HALL, and there was NORHIS,
And GUNTON, TIE, and FENN—
Who swore he 'd save the women,
And did it, there and then.
The Captain's wife jumped thirty feet—
Needs must when Wuloan drives-
Hand over hand—in sailor style—
His daughters saved their lives ;—
Brave girls you see, and well brought np,
The stuff for sailors' wives!
On the tank-barffe some twenty boys
Had climbed dear life to save;
The Hames flared out, the pitched top-
sides
Yawned like a fiery grave;
And some set up the cry, " Shove off I "—
Lads will like lads behave.
But BILLY BOLTON'S boyish voice
Was heard—" I 'm mate in charge:
There 's room enough for plenty more;
Hold on there with the barge."—
That BILLY BOLTON may run small,
The heart in him looms large.

Fourth R's, Old English, Italic, and other. Dissenters and Secu-
larists want instead of the Fourth R to substitute 0, standing for
nought, the symbol of " the propagandism of negation." Of course
R the fourth is superadded to all the R's of the Ragged Schools,
inclusive of their own initial. The KAKL OF 8n AKTKHIICKV, under
whose auspices those schools have been hitherto so usefully con-
ducted, would take oare of that. Bat now another R steps in to
supersede the Ragged Schools with all their R's. They appear to be
officially threatened with extinction by SIR CHARLES RKKD, consi-
dered as the representative and Chairman of the London Sohool-
Board. He boasts of the superior education received by from
12,000 to 15,000 children who have been transferred from the
Ragged Schools to the School Board's. But, according to LOBD
SHAFTESBUBY. as many as 30,000 children had been getting educated
in Ragged Schools, now broken up, of whom from 15,000 to 18,000
seem to be nowhere. Can SIB CHAXLES REED lay his right hand on
his left waistcoat pocket, and say he has not been injuriously poach-
ing on the Shaftesbury preserves P Not to dwell too much on initial
R's, it may be allowable to suggest that the systematic promoters of
popular instruction would do wisely to make quite sure that as
regards the education of London " gutter children," they do not
lean too completely on a broken reed.
