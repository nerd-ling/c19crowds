Now Punch has the belief beating in his heart, that he is about to add another proof–

utterly eschews any attempt to make a market-penny on the mystic number Seven. Were he
not a philosopher, he would do otherwise. Yes, he would discourse of the Seven Wise Men

iv. PREFACE.
He might—also to please his vanity—avow that the EMPERoR of Russia has Seven times inquired whether Punch would
come to St. Petersburgh; in which case, it was the imperial intention to bestow upon him at least Seven knouts, and all going at more
than Seven knots an hour !
Were Punch vain-glorious, he could relate how Louis Philippe, with Seven of his best smiles, congratulated our Sovereign
Lady Victoria on the possession of such a subject as Punch, whilst the QUEEN, PRINCE ALBERT, and all the Royal Infants (the
PRINCE ALFRED shaking his coral bells the while), with Seven times Seven phrases of delight, cried “Io Punch 1”
Punch might also-if he would—display very fine engravings of the Seven Gold-branched Candelabra which he has received
from the KING of PRussia—the Seven Superfine Waistcoats from the KING of SAxony—the Seven False Collars from the Duke
of SAxE-Coburg—the Seven Watch Ribands from the KING of THE BELGIANs—to say nothing of the Seven Penny Pocket-
handkerchiefs from the Hereditary GRAND Duke of MeckleNBURGH-STRELItz! Punch could do this; but then to do so, would be
vanity—gross vanity, and therefore, Punch forbears it.
And thus what secrets might he divulge, and all turning on the cabalistic Number Seven l But is Punch the person to
divulge a secret? Oh, no : therefore his lips are close—“close as oak ;" otherwise he would with vain-gloriousness relate ul:to the
reader how Brough AM is wont, in Parliamentary sittings, to come to him Seven times a day for good counscl—and how Bitou on AM
Seven times a day at least forgets it.
Punch might print the Seven Invitation Cards per week he has from PEEL to take a quiet chop with him, and advise him
for the best.
Punch might also enumerate the Seven Letters he has per post—and remember it is now hourly—from the Lavnirs, and the
LENNoxes, and the Gibbses, and the BuckinghAMs—and the Moons—and (poor little fellows!) the George Joneses—and such very
twinkling obscurities—all such letters prayers for mercy, promising amendment, reformation, conscience-money to an injured world,
and all that ; but
Punch disdains to do it !
No: although this be Punch's Seventh Volume, he will say nothing of Number Seven ; he knows enough of the world to
keep unflinchingly to Number One!
The foolish folks of the earth have thrown it in his teeth, that Punch is made of wood. Punch accepts the odium, and will
glorify himself by it.
He is made of wood: of the like wood that composed the Cremona and Amati fiddles. A wood that with every year receives
a strengthening power of melody: a wood that, with use, gives forth increasing harmonies, as though strung with the heart-strings
of angels
Hark! the strings are now vibrating. And what think ye—gentle readers, do they play ? Why, Punch putting his soul
into the strain, plays to the tens and hundreds of thousands who listen to his hebdomadal crotchets and quavers; he plays to a tune
of his own—
“ £i ſãrrry (ºristmas, amb a 30appy jºtto ºrat 1”

MY DEAR SIR James,
Having, as I
modestly believe, writ-
ten a Complete Letter-
Writer – yes, having
penned some fifty models
of epistolary correspon-
dence, involving all the
affections, interests, rights, wrongs, and courtesies of social life,
I am naturally anxious to obtain for the work the protecting coun-
tenance of a high, appropriate name. Your official privilege makes
you, in truth, the very interesting object I have some time looked for
with increasing despair. I confess it; L desponded lest I should fail
to obtain a patron whose natural genius and finely educated taste
would immediately appreciate in my labour the manifold heart-
touches, the subtleties of style, with—greater glory than all that—
practical golden wisdom, without which the very finest writing is
little more than the very finest glass-blowing.
A mere high title at the head of a Dedication is a piece of pompous
lumber. In the shallowness of our judgment, we bestow a humiliat-
ing pity on the forlorn savage who lays his offering of fruits and
flowers before his wooden idol with a formidable name; an idol cer.
tainly with gold rings in its nose and ears, and perhaps an uncut
diamond in its forehead; but nevertheless, an insensible block. The
fruits shrivel and rot; the flowers die a death of profitless sweetness;
for the idol has no gustatory sense—no expanding nostril. I say, we
pity the poor, darkened fool, who may have risked his limbs for
cocoa-nuts, who may have tempted the whole family of mortal
snakes, groping his way through woods, scrambling up ravines to
gather flowers, and only to lay the hard winnings of his toil before a
stock, a stone, that cannot even so much as wink a thankfulness for
such desperate duty done.
And what shall we say of the author who, choosing a patron merely
for his titles—for the gold rings in his nose and ears, and certainly
not for the diamond in his head—lays before him a book for which
the poor creature has not the slightest relish He is incapable of
tasting its deliciousness. Its most sapid morsels lie in his mouth
like bran. He chews and chews a prime cut, yea, the very pope's-
eye of philosophy, as it were chopped hay. I bestow ink upon no such
man. And thou, sagacious and therefore pacific goose, still enjoy
thy common right; still with snaky neck search the short grass,
still, with fixed and meditating look, eye man askance—I disturb
thee not ; I rifle not thy wing of its gray wealth to nib a pen for such
a patron.
But hither, hither, ye sprites and genii—old visitants of dimmest
garrets—ye who have made the musty air musical with your quivering
pinions, and with kindly conjurations given state to stateless kings,
who, from their attic thrones, rule the thankless and despising world
beneath, hither ye, who from the phials of hope have sweetened
the bitterness of the present, who first did crown the poet in his
solemn solitude, and—no illusion but sweetest truth !—made him see
in every growing line a grove of budding laurel—made him with a
shuddering glee hear the far-off praises of the future, even as men
hear the distant music of a coming triumph 1 Hither, hither, ye
Parnassian fays, and bring me ink—bright ink—odorous ink—ink
made in the deep recesses of some Indian wood, dark as night, yet
fragrant as the morn.
Well done. It is black and liquid as a black eye smiling sweet
mischief on unconscious man. And now, boys, a pen Stay, know
ye the vicarage of Purplecloth It is a fruitful nook, where there
is an hourly struggle between the rector and his geese which shall be
the fattest, man or birds. Hieye there, and straightway choose the
primest goose. Kill him, yet kill him quickly, humanely, singing some
sacrificial melody the while. He will give up his quills serenely,
quietly as a dying laureat. When the goose is dead, take care that
the creature be properly buried ; to which end I charge ye give his
body to the poor.
So I An errand quickly done. Here is pen and ink. As for paper
—no matter; out of the most beautiful, yet costly bravado, I will
write my Dedication on the back of a £50 note, which—the words
enshrined in type—be it known, remains the perquisite of the printer.
May he make the most he can of it! And now to begin my Dedica-
tion in good earnest.
MY DEAR SIR JAMEs,
I perceive from the works of those daily law-breakers, the
reporters of Parliamentary speeches, that you have the right—a right
solemnised by law—to burglariously break and enter into every
package, bundle, letter, note, or billet-doux, sent through the Post-
office. Yes; you are permitted this high privilege by the Act of
1 Victonia (whom God preserve :)
I protest, SIR JAMEs, that henceforth I shall never think of that
crowning pile of St. Martin's-le-Grand, without seeing you in imagi-
nation working away with a crow-bar, smashing red and black wax–
or, by the more subtle agency of steam, softening wafers, that the
letter may open its lips, and yield up the contents of its very heart
to the Secretary of the Home Department.
I am not a squeamish creature, SIR JAMEs. I have not what is
called by the world false modesty: a modesty, I presume, to be classed
with false ringlets and false teeth, and therefore never used but
when the real thing is wholly departed. No ; I have seen too much
of the world to care a great deal for its turned-up noses and the
ugly mouths it may make at me. Nevertheless, SIR JAMEs, there is
a point between philosophy and apathy. Yes; the rhinoceros has
his tender part—I have mine; so tender, and withal so vital, that I
cannot get rid of it. Were I, like Achill Es, vulnerable only lin
one heel, I would instantly cheat fate of its malice, have my limb
amputated, and laugh securely at destiny on a wooden leg. This,
Sir James, I would do: but a man cannot take the weak parts of
his heart away as dexterously as a careful housewife removes the
fly-blow from meat. Hence my complaint. -
My one weakness—(for weaknesses, strangely enough, are like
wives; no man, whatever the truth may be, thinks it proper to own
to more than one at a time,)—my one weakness is a disgust, a horror,
that any man should dare to profane the sanctity of my letters I
know not—for if a man can save a bit of self-flattery out of his
weakness, it is so much virtue got, as one may say, out of the fire-I
know not if this aversion may not, in some degree, arise from my
love of mankind, and consequently my annoyance at seeing it in a
paltry, pitiable condition, pushing its brazen nose where only its
brass can protect it. Be this as it may ; when I learned this morning
that you, Sin JAMEs, made yourself a sort of horse or ass-hair sieve,
through which the correspondence of men was passed, that, if there;
the daggers, pikes, and pistols of the writers might be duly deposited
in the state vessel appointed to detect them—I confess it, I felt in a
paroxysm of passion, for the proper expression of which no words
have as yet been fashioned.
And for this just reason. I knew that my name was too much
noised in the world to escape even the ears of Cabinet Ministers.
Hence, I felt assured that my letters—and the thousands I receive 1
—had all of them been defiled by the eyes of a spy; that all my
most domestic secrets had been rumpled and touzled, and pinched
here and pinched there—searched by an English Minister as shwd-
dering modesty is searched at a French custom-house! My first

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 3
feeling, Sia JAMEs, was intense indignation; and then I vehemently
slapped my breast, and so, giving the virtue a jerk, pity came upper-
most.
Then I thought, how can I and SIR JAMEs ever meet again?
When we met, I was wont to don a crimson waistcoat, worked with
all sorts of impossibilities in gold; to wear a court coat of cut choco-
late velvet, and silk stockings shining like glass. Knowing that the
vulgar were taken by such things, I always went among Cabinet
Ministers, drest to the amazement even of tailors. SIR JAMEs, you
know my secret, and how in that dress can we meet again Deny
it not ; you must know it, for you have read MR. NATHAN's letters
long before they came to my unconscious hand, letters demanding
of me, I will not take upon myself to say how many times, payment
for the hire of that crimson waistcoat and chocolate velvet coat
This is one case; I might cite a hundred.
At length, I took comfort. A true chymist will extract sugar even
from the cudgel he has been beaten with. SIR JAMEs has, I thought,
ill-used me, but nevertheless, from his very shabbiness will I extract
the sweets of patronage. I will dedicate to him my “Complete Letter-
Writer;” and for this reason—a reason stringent as an iron hoop.
As SIR JAMEs GRAHAM has the whole run of the Post-office—as
he has the unquestioned fingering of all the letters of the QUEEN’s
subjects—he cannot but possess a most refined, most exquisite taste,
for the graces of epistolary composition. Yes; he above all men,
from his large reading of the subject, will take and hug to his bosom
—if Ministers own such physical vulgarities—Punch's CoMpleTE
LETTER-WRITER. He will appreciate its many-coloured style; he
will acknowledge it as a work to supersede all works of the sort
hitherto written; he will—perhaps in his place in Parliament, and
so save a considerable sum in the way of advertisements—declare of
the book, that no family should be without it; and that every gentle-
man's library, having all else, yet wanting IT, has nothing !
Therefore, SIR JAMEs, it is with the profoundest opinion of your
experienced ability to judge the surpassing merits of the volume—
a volume for the world—that PUNch’s Complet E WRITER is dedi-
cated to you,
By your Old Acquaintance,
#3552C19.
Be it known, SIR JAMEs, that the aforesaid Letters will be published
every week until the conclusion of the present—Punch's seventh—
volume.
MEDITATIONS BY A DESPAIRING ANGLER.
(suggest ED BY Lord wallennox's ode “The Isles of GREEcE.")
The Isle of Eels: The Isle of Eels'
Where Mrs. Horkins dined and sung;
Where first (as this seared heart reveals),
My passion for the Widow sprung
The pies are good, and so 's the ale-
But all to me is flat and stale !
Fill high the glass with ginger wine!–
On Richmond's bridge, or Twit’nam’s
shore,
Oſt had I held my rod and line,—
But never had a bitc. before :
There was a downright tug that day;-
But ah! he tugged, and swam away !
Where Richmond looks on Teddington,
In patient guise I threw my line;
And fishing there (and catching none)
I dreamt, that she might still be mine:
For, dressed in DoudNEy's light gambroon,
I could not deem myself a spoon.
And where is he? And where art thou,
My widow? At the Angler's heart
Thou gav'st one mighty tug, and now
Art fled—but hast received no smart!
Such loss would sure a Stoic move-
My only fish My only love'
Place me on RAI Lton's stunted post."
(Queer pedestal for FRANck's FEAR);
And fishing there with Nelson’s Ghost,
I'm sure I.’d catch as much as here !
DoudNEY and line no more be mine—
Dash down—no, don't—that ginger wine!
Fill high the glass with ginger wine!—
We will not think on this here theme;
Not for the charming Widow pine;
Others may yet more charming seem.
More charming? Ah, it cannot be—
Her equal never made the tea!
AN APPROPRIATE PRESENT.
It is now generally known that the distinguished lady who proposed to
the Emperor of Russia a postponement of the Polish Ball, in delicate
deference to imperial feelings, was her Grace the Duchess of someuser.
It appears that the act was not lost upon the mind of the EMPERoR, who
has most appropriately rewarded the zeal of the Patroness ; for last week
Nicholas forwarded to the Duchess a magnificent armlet, in the shape of
a caterpillar set with brilliants. The present has been much admired in
. circles for its costliness, and, more, for the peculiar fitness of the
evice.
LAUGHING MADE EASY.
The Paris Charivari is quite angry with Punch for laughing at France.
If our contemporary wishes to retaliate, why doesn't he read our Parlia-
mentary Debates 1
* The Nelson column.
THE PRIZE COMEDY.
he Committee, consenting to select the
Prize Comedy from the ninety-eight
comedies sent into the Haymarket, have
done a very handsome thing. Very
handsome. Finding that Quid pro Quo
has failed, the Committee have among
themselves subscribed the 500l., and
handed over the sum to M.R. WEBSTER.
We are enabled to give the letter of
MR. Charles KEMBLE (Chairman of the
Committee), to the Haymarket manager.
CHARLES KEMBLE TO BENJAMIN WEBSTER, ESQ.
MY DEAR SIR,
Quid pro Quo has deceived us all. True it is, there were several
comedies among the batch much better written, but we thought there was
more real fun in the play we selected; and real fun, you will allow, is of
great value in the legitimate drama, and more especially in a comedy
illustrative of living manners. We had great hopes of the slang put into
the mouth of Mas. Nisbett, as also of the cigar in the same pleasant
predicament. Both the slang and the cigar—we all of us keenly feel the
disappointment—decidedly failed.
Under these circumstances—with the comedy of their choice limping
and not running—the Committee consider that a strong verdict has been
passed upon their judgment; they themselves all feel, as LAUNCELot Gobbo
saith, “like an ill-roasted egg, damned on one side.” Not a hiss escaped
the audience on the first night that the Committee did not honestly appro-
priate half the sibilation to themselves. I assure you, that the Committee
considered it a strong evidence of either the indulgence or forgetfulness of
an intelligent British public, that the audience did not summon the judges
before the curtain, and when there visit them with a very significant
sentence for their false judgment. I must, however, say this for the Com-
mittee ; every man of them was ready to suffer the result of his respon-
sibility, whether administered from the galleries in the shape of nuts,
apples, oranges, or gingerbeer bottles. -
9 come, however, to the more gratifying purpose of this letter. Upon
our judgment, sir, you paid 500l.-that judgment is now proved not to be
worth as many farthings. The Committee have, therefore, subscribed the
500l.—they could not turn comfortably in their honest beds until they had
done so-for which sum I have the pleasure to enclose you a cheque pay-
able at Messrs. ALDGATE, PUMP, and CoMPANY, and remain,
My dear Sir, yours always,
B. WEBSTER, Esq. CHARLEs KEMBLE.
P.S.. I had almost forgotten to say that, as I am about to recommence
my readings of Hamlet, &c., I shall be very happy also to read (“for a
consideration ”) any, or all of the rejected comedies, just to unbend the
mind of the audience after Shakspere.
This letter, it must be owned, demands but little comment; it speaks
for itself. Nothing less was to have been expected from the honourable
men who composed the Committee appointed to declare the Prize Comedy.
THE KENSINGTON RAILROAD.
[From our own Correspondent.]
In order to preserve the strict privacy and utter retirement to which
this railway seems devoted, a hoarding has been put up to prevent the
public from seeing the trains, so that any passenger who goes by them
may enjoy the most secluded solitude. An application has been made to
Wimbush to put his omnibus in connection with the line, so that the whole
arrangements may be in strict keeping with that spirit of extreme one-
ness, which has hitherto been obvious in the number of passengers, who
have started by the Kensington Railway. One cab has also been put upon
the vacant ground in front of the booking-office, but at present nothing
seems to have been booked but the railroad itself. One waterman is also
appointed to the bench on the public-house opposite, where he sits all
day in close and anxious consultation with the one cabman.
A PLEASANT REFLECTION.
The scientific papers say a beautiful Northern Light was seen distinctly
on the 8th of June. This is quite a mistake ; it was a grand illumination
throughout Siberia in honour of the EMPERoR's absence from Russia.

Paivate and confident---L-
Our terrific artist has made a representation of the
Home Secretary, which we recommend to every Post-
master, Banking-house, Merchant's Office, and private
family in England: and which we present this week
GRAt 1s. It is cheap, elegant, finely drawn, a wonder-
ful likeness, and a most moral and interesting allegory.
Look at him, and see how his fine eye is a rolling
between the folds of the letter; lighted up with a tender,
curious, and parental expression 1
Look at him, Ladies and Gentlemen — the Right
Honourable Secretary of State for the Home Depart-
ment: discharging one of the noblest duties of his high
office. As Load LYNDHuast is Chancellor and Keeper of
the Seals, Sin JAMEs GRAHAM is a Breaker of the same.
Look at this enlightened patron of Letters! Far from
denying the soft impeachment the other night, he owned
it like a man. If the EMPERon or Austria has a fancy
to know the nature of any person's correspondence, Sin
JAMEs GRAAAM will get the little job done for him. If
the Pope of Rome, or the Prince of Toun And
TAxis, or the EMPERon of Russia, or any other
crowned gentleman, is anxious to be acquainted with
the doings of his subjects in this country, a word to
SIR. JAMEs GRAHAM, and the English Home Secretary
will be charmed to oblige him.
There is nothing like mutual accommodation. Let us
keep well with the Governments of Europe. Politeness
costs mothing. In this case you do but open a letter, read
it, sealit up again cleverly, and sendit on to its address. Is
the text a bit altered because somebody has just glanced
his eye over it? No, no more than your face is changed
because a policeman looks at you in the street.
There never was a more absurd complaint than that
of Count Oysterowski lately. He said something
uncomplimentary of the EMPERoR of Russia, or the
Imperial Trousers, for which the police seized the Count,
his paper-knives, and the papers in his desk. If a man
chooses to talk disrespectfully of an Emperor's breeches,
it is a natural consequence that his papers should be
seized. If his papers are seized, it is a natural conse-
quence that they should be read. If they are read, and
contain anything treasonable, the fault lies with him.
Why did he write or receive anything improper; and what
business has he to abuse the breeches of any crowned
head? The only Emperor one can speak of with safety
is the KAIs En of TIMBuctoo, for he wears none—but
this is not to the purpose.
The question is this—as the Duke, Sir JAMEs, and
other revered Statesmen put it. It is the duty of a
Government to look into letters if they suspect the letters
to contain anything wrong.
Now, Governments are like men, more or less suspicious,
according to their temperament. Hence, the more a
Government is hated, the more suspicious it will naturally
become; and the more it is its duty to open letters. What
a happy knack at letter-burglary some folks may get at this rate,
and what an enlarged sphere of agreeable “duties 1” It was the duty
of the Council of Ten to clap any gentleman under the Plombes if
they suspected him : it was the duty of the EMPERon NApoleon and
Louis XVIII. to have a Cabinet Noir, and to open everybody's
letters: it is the duty of the admirable EMPERoR N1cholas
to have spies upon every man of mark in his dominions ; to have
little men to spy great men, fathers to spy sons, and rice rersá;
and what is history for, but that Statesmen may profit by it; and
why are our governors to neglect advantages which every other
civilised state possesses? The only monarch who perhaps does not
open letters is TIMBuctoo before mentioned: and why?—See the
paragraph concerning the pantaloons.
As there is not the least reason why letters should not be opened,
there is not the least reason why other means of espial should not
be adopted: if SIR JAMEs GRAHAM
directly it becomes a duty to gratify all a Minister's suspicions, or
those of any adviser of his who suspects—there is no end to the duty
which will fall upon him.

suspects anything wrong,
For instance, because a tailor in St. James's street
suspects that Count Oystemowski has intentions against
Russia, the Count's papers are seized : because the .
Austrian or Sardinian, or any other legation, suspects
Ma. MAzzIN1, the letters that his friends write to him
are opened—it might enter into somebody's head to sus-
pect that MR. Rothschild was engaged in treasonable
speculations, and, of course, it would be necessary to open
his letters to his broker to buy or sell; it might be
suspected that MR. O'Conne LL's designs were suspicious,
and all letters to him or to Irish members, or to the cor-
respondents of Irish members, ought to be looked to, out
of mere duty—let the CHANcellon look to it: here's a
fine opportunity for a commission.
In the debate in the Lords upon the subject, there was
one sensible thing said by our dear old Brough AM. He
defended the letter-opening practice of course-Queen
Canoline's Attorney-General admitted that “cases
might arise, in which it might be necessary to obtain
infºrmation in this way;” a man should pursue “useful
knowledge” in spite of any such paltry difficulties as a
wafer or a bit of sealing-wax. But he did confess “that
it was a rery popular thing to declaim against the opening of
letters in the Post Office.”
Yes, so popular a thing, that we hope every print in
every part of the nation will declaim against it, and
against Right Honourable Gentlemen who do it... It is
likewise a popular thing to declaim against picking
pockets—well then, don't let us be ashamed of being in
the fashion.
“SPECTATOR” ON THE “WESTERN
GENII.”
THE
His blood is snow-broth.-Shakespers.
The Spectator of Sunday, last put its icy paw upon the
poets who publish with Mr. Moxon. “No one of those western
genii,” it says, “is distinguished for a very manly or very
healthy tone of mind.”. Among these genii, be it remembered,
is ALFRED TENNyson, the writer of Locksley Hall, and BARRY
CoanwALL, whose songs “stir the blood like a trumpet.” To
these—he is in glorious company; and, more, is worthy of it—
the spectator adds, MR. Coveniny Parmore, a very young
writer, who has just given to the world a small volume of
poems—full of various beauty, a volume which we heartily
recommend to all men. The Spectator in its own blight-
ing way reviews these poems—as an east wind would review
peach-blossoms—calling them nought ; and this time, at least,
adding to its general unimaginative qualities, the sin of heavy
ignorance. For instance, we believe no poetic critic—save
the gentleman who “does”, the “western geni” in the
Speciator—could make the blunder we are about to charge
him with. Once upon a time there lived a man—he wrote
little stories—named Boccaccio. Among these—almost the
gem of them—is the story of the falcon. Well, MR. PATMoRE
takes this story, indicating as much in a line of verse. He
-- changes the name of the Italian hero Fredesigo into Sir
Hungar, and faithfully keeping to the story, writes his poem.
Now what says the Spectator of its plot
-- -> ability at defiance. The scene is laid in times of
ai. º of*::::: *:§: : º: substance in feasting a lady who
weds somebody else; and then, instead of taking to the wars, or the road, Sir Hpakht
turns day-labourer, on what is called his last farm; which is so pool and unprofitable,
that when his mistress, some years afterwards, visits him as a widºw, to request a favour,
he has to kill his hawk for dinner, though it turns ºut that the bird she has eaten was the
- anted. "Such is the bathos of the school we speak of; such the substitute for
::::: . minners and reason in conduct - and such the sort of weakness which often
mar, the effect of considerable poetical powers' -
Poor Boccaccio, after some five hundred years, unconsciously ºn-
demned for “bathos” in the person of a young poet of 1844. The
“school we speak of" being opened in the fourteenth century, it is heavily
censured as the weakness of the nineteenth
wenust own, however, that when we had gone through the frost-work
which the spectator puts forth for poetic criticism, we felt that, in this
sultry weather a shake of the hand from the critic must be a refreshing
thing.
Good News-The Scotch papers say, that the grouse are very plentiful
this year; so that we may reasonably indulge in the Pleasing anticipation

AMEN CORNER.
His pleasant little cranny of our “right little
tight little island ”’ nestles almost under
the shadow of St. Paul, and is a sort of
offshoot or runner from Paternoster Row,
where the ancient clerici used to meet to
repeat their paternosters. In the days of
monkish error it was a superstition of the
people, that while the frères or friars were
at their paternosters, those who got into
a corner and said “Amen,” would be
fortunate for a whole year—(vide Brand)
—and hence the corner itself got the
name of Amen, from the use it was devoted
to. This explains the meaning of the
assage in Macbeth, where the ambitious
Thane, finding himself driven into a
corner, pathetically observes—“I could not say amen”—which is a direct
allusion to Amen Corner; though it has baffled the acumen of Knight
and the research of Collier. -
Though Amen Corner is considerably altered since the time of SHAK-
speARE, there is still a literary interest attaches to it; and there is a
plank in the warehouse of Mr. ORR, the publisher, which is said to be
the very one which Johnson stood upon when he entered into the engage-
ment with Cave, of the “Gentleman's Magazine,” to do a portion of the
theatricals. In allusion to this circumstance, we are enabled to add an
anecdote that was put into our hands by one of the partners of the
executor of the son of one of the early friends of Boswell. Somehow it
never got into “The Life.” But we are happy to give it, as illustra-
tive of the habits and customs of Amen Corner at the period alluded to.
“Johnson being rather cheerful, I asked him the reason, and I ven-
tured to observe that in proportion as our spirits were high, our counte-
nances became animated. “Sir," said Johnson, “the man who would be
cheerful at all times is a fool; but he who would be cheerful at no time
is a humbug.' I then observed that it was not my nature to be very
cheerful ; and seeing Johnson to be in a communicative mood, I ventured,
in the hope of drawing him out, to ask him if he thought me a humbug.
‘Sir," said he, “you are a dreadful humbug." After that we went to the
Mitre, and he did me the honour to sup with me.”
With this characteristic and appropriate anecdote we close the present
paper on the Nooks and Corners of Old England.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COMIC BLACK STON E.
prologue TO PART II.
2 he Second Part of BLAckstone touches on
Real Property—though, by-the-bye, any pro-
perty that is not real, can scarcely be called
property at all—and this division of the
subject is said to comprise the rights of
things, which, as everybody likes to know
the rights of things, will be a very popular
topic with the multitude.
CHAPTER THE FIRST.—OF REAL PROPERTY;
AND FIRST, OF CORPOREAL HEREDITA-
MENTS.
The Law of England distributes things into
two kinds—real and personal ; though we
should personally be really sorry to leave our things to be distributed by
the law, for if we did, we should not expect to see much more of them.
Things real are such as are fixed and immovable, which cannot be carried
out of their place, such as a Ministry that will not resign, and looks upon
itself as the real thing, or just the thing, to carry on the Government.
Lands are called things real, because they cannot be moved; but goods
are called personal, because they can be moved, as landlords sometimes
find out when they discover that the moon has been cruelly shot by an
unprincipled tenant. In treating of things real, we shall consider–First,
their sorts; but, by-the-bye, those individuals who have nothing that is
real, must be terribly out of sorts: Secondly, the tenures by which things
real may be holden—we have seen a man at a fair hold a real red-hot
poker in his hand, but by what tenure we never could find out: Thirdly,
the estates which may be had in them : and Fourthly, the title to them,
or how they may be got, and how they may be lost, the latter being a point
that the law is very fond of arriving at. Things real consist in lands,
tenements, and hereditaments. Land means anything substantial, but it
don't mean a substantial dinner—tenement means anything that can be
holden, though it don't mean a woman's tongue, which the owner can
hold sometimes—and an hereditament means anything that can be in-
herited.
Hereditaments are of two kinds—corporeal and incorporeal; the
first of which will be treated of in the present chapter. Corporeal here-
ditaments can only be such as affect the senses, though it is not necessary
they should be calculated to drive people mad; nor was the Cock Lane
Ghost, who frightened a few individuals out of their wits, a corporeal
hereditament. They may all be comprised under the name of Land,
which signifies any ground or soil whatever, so that a flower-pot with
mould in it is the lowest species of real property, though when it is on the
outside of an attic window, it assumes a somewhat higher position.
Land also includes castles, except, perhaps, castles in the air. ater is
also Land in the eye of the law, because the law takes a dry view of
everything, and looks not at the water, but at the ground beneath it.
Land also comprises everything above and everything beneath it, so
that the owner of the soil may carry a building to any height he pleases,
even as far as the very clouds themselves, which would, perhaps, be the
height of absurdity. He may also go downwards, to the very centre of
the earth, but if he went beyond that point, the landlord at the immediate
antipodes would have an action of trespass. Land, therefore, does not
mean the mere face of the earth, but the very “bowels of the land,” which
Richmond, when he seemed bent on showing his dominion over the soil,
expressed his intention of marching into. If a man grants only water, he
grants nothing but a right of fishing, which may be called possession with
a hook, and can scarcely be said to descend in a right line to one's
posterity. By the title of water nothing passes, except a right of fishing,
though, by-the-bye, water itself often passes by the title of milk—but by
the name of land anything terrestrial will pass, except, perhaps, fullers'
earth, which is the only instance that we are aware of, in which the
earth itself cannot be regarded as real property.
*ire I Lºire I
IncendiaRisk is rife in Suffolk, where the devouring element is making
a pretty progress. A shilling or two a week of extra wages would insure
the whole of the property; but the farmers unaccountably neglect the
precaution. Is it possible that they are ignorant of the efficacy of that
well-known fluid, Beer, and those familiar substances, Bread and Fat
Bacon, in extinguishing this species of combustion 1 Agricultural
Chemistry must be in a very backward state in Suffolk.
MEAN STRATAGEM.
- The French papers are accusing the English Government of im orting
into Morocco a quantity of arms and ammunition. If the “Albert ap” is
amongst them, we can feel for the alarm of our neighbours, as the French
troups, we will be bound, have not yet seen anything like it.
T H E G R A H A M L E T T E R S.
[PRIVATE AND confidential.]
IT appears that SIR Jaxies GRAHAM has not confined the civility,
which tempts him to break seals, to the ambassador of Sardinia.
No ; we find that SIR JAMEs has been for some time in correspond-
ence with many of the potentates of the world; all of whom had
cause to fear that treason dangerous to their thrones was constantly
passing through the English Post-Office. The letters addressed to
SIR JAMEs have fallen into the hands of Punch, who, profiting by the
example of the Home Secretary, immediately opened them. We
give the contents of two of the epistles.
“MULEY ABDERRAH MAN, Emperor of Morocco, to the Great
GRAHAM, health and greeting !
“Whereas, the EMPERoR believes that one BEN ALI BEN MoMo,
his lawful subject, is at the present time dwelling in Ratcliffe-High-
way, for the wicked purpose of carrying the fire and sword of
rebellion into the happy city of Timbuctoo, the EMPERoR prays of
the magnificent GRAHAM (whose name is sweeter than roses), that
he will seize all letters coming to the said BEN ALI BEN MoMo, and
straightway send faithful copies thereof to the EMPERon, who will
remember the pious GRAHAM in his prayers.
“The Emperor herewith sends to the mighty GRAHAM the Order
of the Umbrella |
“The EMPERon should not omit to say that BEN ALI BEN MoMo
(son of a dog, as he is ) is frequently changing his house and occu-
pation. Sometimes the EMPERoR is informed he is to be found, with
a broom in his hand, near the Alley of the Cranbourn.”
“Poxi.Aná, Queen of Tahiti, cries to the compassionate GRAHAM in
her distress. Her heart is smitten, and her name made a by-word
by Owy HAPTEEK1, who is now dwelling in London. The said
Owy HAPTEEK1 is her lawful subject, and is now fomenting treason
in the great city with six French dancers, men and women, that by
such treason QUEEN Ponia Ré may be sent prisoner to Paris, and her
kingdom become the property of France. QUEEN Pomaaß believes
that some of her wicked subjects at Tahiti write letters to Owyhar-
TEEK1 ; and she therefore prays that the glorious GRAHAM, faithful
servant of her dear sister Victon 1A, will not fail to seize upon all
such letters, and without delay send them to Tahiti by a fast-sailing
ship. It is only by such means—as QUEEN Pomahá from her soul
believes—that nations can be united in a flowery bond one with
another. It is only by breaking the seals of their letters, that the
hearts of subjects are to be properly known. Blessed is England,
blessed with a GRAHAM Happy land, with such a man of post-office
wax :
“Que EN Pomare feels it necessary to advise the magnificent
GRAHAM of the guile and craft of Owy HAPTEEK1. Sometimes he
is to be seen, carrying a parrot in a cage for sale; sometimes slip-
pers; sometimes, that he may the better disguise his treasonous
intentions against his mother-land Tahiti, he offers to the good and
unsuspecting English bamboo-canes and cocoa-nuts.
“QUEEN Pom ARé has only another prayer to put up to the great
heart of GRAHAM. It is this ; which, with affection for her dear
sister Victor 1A, she hopes will be granted. QUEEN Pomané intends
to establish the penny post throughout her vast dominions; that, in-
structed by the wisdom of the all-knowing GRAHAM, she may the
better learn the sentiments of her subjects towards her. As, however,
QUEEN Pom ARé's people are as children before the subjects of her
dear sister Victon 1A, she prays of the bountiful GRAHAM that he
will delay not to send to Tahiti a cunning man instructed after the
great GRAHAM's heart, who can turn letters inside out, break seals,
and undo wafers.
“This Queen Pomane prays of the great GRAHAM ; and also prays
for him, that he may meet with that sweet reward his virtues here on
earth deserve l’”
There are other letters of the like nature from Abn-El-KADER, the
Dictator SANTA ANNA, and the Pop E. We have, however, no space
for them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SIR PETER LAURIE, THE LORD MAYOR, AND THE
KING OF SAXONY.
Aying closely watched the treatment experienced by
SAxony, since he has been in London, we declare
it beats anything that has been recorded in the
whole annals of coolness. The courtesies of life
and the book of etiquette have been utterly set
at defiance. The other day his broad-clothian
Majesty was invited to take what was termed in
the note of invitation une snacke (a snack) with
MAGNAY. The Lord MAYor and the KING had
scarcely taken a mouthful of the sandwiches,
of which the repast consisted, when three men
—a beadle and two others—rushed precipitately
into the room, the beadle exclaiming vehemently,
“A Deputation l’’ while the other two men tum-
bled almost into the Lord MAYoR's plate, and
caused him to drop his knife and fork, until
he had ascertained comment le chat woudrait définitivement sauter how the
cat would ultimately jump). At length it was explained, in a sort of patois
of German, French, English, and Italian, that the intruders were SIR PETER
LAURIE, and MR. MastERMAN, the M. P., who, pioneered by one of those
mercenaries that bear the name of beadle, had come under the guise of a
deputation to invite the KING of SAxony to give éclat to the inauguration
of the Wellington statue, of which the first toe had been laid on a pre-
vious occasion. An enormous row then ensued between the Lord MAYon
and SIR PETER, the latter trying to pull SAxony out of his place by what
is usually termed the scurf of the neck, and the former holding him
down by the small of his back with anxious vehemence. It was decidedly
a case of Boulanger v. Diable, till at last the intruding trio giving
a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull altogether, fairly hoisted Saxony
out of his seat, and hurrying him down the stairs of the Mansion House,
got him into the Poultry, where MAGNAY, smarting from defeat, came
to terms with SIR PETER—simply stipulating for the right of walking
arm-in-arm with his guest as far as the Royal Exchange, where the statue
was to be inaugurated. We can fancy the indignant tone in which the
future historian will record this strange event. The following will be
the mode in which some paulo-post-futuro HUME, or preter-plu-perfect
SMolleTT will describe the transaction by which our remarks have been
elicited.
“At this period the destinies of the city were swayed by one MAGNAY,
who united with a strong love of display an utter distaste for the expense
which necessarily attended it. One day he was sitting over a frugal
repast with the KING of Saxony, when one LAURIE, who had originally
made saddles for the soldiery, rushed into the apartment, dragging in one
of the city members by the arm, and attended by one of his mercenaries
—a beadle of desperate fortunes. , MAGNAY, who, it was suspected, might
not be altogether displeased by the interruption offered to the meal,
sprang from his chair with well-dissembled rage, according to some ;
while, according to others, he was really vexed at the banquet being
broken in upon. The unhappy monarch was then torn from his chair,
and dragged through the streets by the arm, amid the shouts of the
assembled populace. LAURIE, who appeared to be in league with one
MASTERMAN, and the executors of an individual named CHANTREy—
a worker in stone—conducted the insulted Sovereign to an open space,
where he was compelled to listen to a long harangue in a foreign tongue,
which, as he could not understand, he did not attempt to appreciate. The
wretched and degraded monarch was then led back to the Mansion
House, where he was suffered to finish his interrupted meal, with an
appetite which rendered him for the remainder of the day an object of
aversion even to the man who professed to be entertaining him.”
Submarine Operations.
We are happy to hear that several of the troops are being drilled to go
under water ; and as it is thought not quite so well “to send them to the
bottom without an object,” they are instructed to pick up anything they
can lay their hands upon. Corporal Splash has captured a blacking bottle,
and Private Pubbs has been tremendously successful in bringing up
repeated handfuls of oystershells, amid the cheers of his gallant comrades.
We have not yet heard the use that the aquatic troops will be put to,
in the event of their being brought into action. The general impression is,
that they will be armed with gimlets, and that their duty will be to bore
holes in the bottoms of the ships of the enemy.
APPROPRIATE INSCRIPTION.
We understand that the memorable words Napoleon addressed to his
soldiers about the Pyramids are to be inscribed, with one alteration, on
both the towers of Hungerford Bridge: “Du haut deces tours quarante
siècles vous regardent”; this being supposed to be the time they will take
before the building is completely finished.
TO GOVERNESSES OF “DECIDED PIETY.”
In the advertisement pages of The Evangelical Magazine for the pre-
sent month, will be found the subjoined:—
ANTED, a YOUNG PERSON, of decided piety, about 22 years of
age, to TAKE the CHARGE of, and Educate, THREE CHILDREN, under 12
years. . She must be capable of imparting a sound English education, with French and
Music! Any one who would feel anrious for the welfare of the children, will be treated
as one of the family, and may realize the comforts of a home. Salary 8t. per annum,
Every application must contain real name and address (post-paid). Direct G. I., at
Mr. Bauck's, Stationer, Trump-street, King-street, Cheapside.
There is little doubt that “ G. I.” will obtain an instructress,
“anxious for the welfare of his children;” at least, equally anxious
as their devoted parent, seeing that he is ready to sacrifice “8l. per
annum,” that is, 21.13s. 4d. per head for their sound English educa-
tion, with French and Music
There is certainly this little alloy in the golden offer; namely, that
the governess will absolutely be treated as “one of the family;” for,
reader, consider what a family
However, “G. I.,” by his yearnings for “decided piety” has inte-
rested us. We are anxious that, for his magnificent 81. per annum—
(by the way, what may he give the boy who cleans the knives and
forks :)—he should have the very best instruction for his babes pur-
chaseable by so liberal a sum. There is much philanthropy as well
as paternal love in this 8l. per annum; every shilling of it speaks the
benevolence of “G. I.” Yes | we hear at least one hundred and
sixty silver voices, crying altogether, “What a Christian 1"
Let us consider what sort of reading, in the way of an English
education, would harmonise with the apparent spirit of “G. I.,” as
developed in his advertisement. Would not daily lectures on the
beauties of BLIFIL comfort the parental heart? And if he have not
forsworn the drama as a pestilent thing, might not an oceasional
reading of the Hypocrite, with a frequent disquisition on the worldly
wisdom of the excellent MR. Scrooge, be, in the judgment of “G.I.,”
admirably adapted to form the mind of his children after the excel-
lent model of their father ?
As for French, we propose a frequent reading of that part of GIL
BLAs, in which AMBR.ois E DE LAMELA so often visits a church that
he may more securely rob his master ; together with a frequent
perusal of Rob ERT MACAIRE, in all his inimitable ingenuities.
And next for Musie : let the governess, at £8 per annum, choose
for her general theme the air of “This cold, flinty rock,” occasionally
varied with, “He was despised among men.”
Excellent “G. I.” I Would we could have his portrait ! Yet,
wherefore the wish Do we not see him, ay, as plainly as the
ink-marks before us? Does not the reader behold him Nay,
peruse his advertisement once more ; and now is he visible in the
sheet, as though done by Jack LEEch himself. Look at him I Hath
he not a sulphur-tinted cheek—a crop of hair, smooth and shining as
court-plaister, over his inch-deep brow—and an eye expressly made
to shudder at carnal sins and bad shillings
And this very man is of the set of men who, believing they be-
lieve in the Bible, think the human heart is poor worldly vanity,
altogether extra of the sacred book. They have every respect for
religion in a fine large type, but for the daily religion between man
and man—for that sense of justice which abhors oppressive chaffering
with the needy—that refuses to drive its hard, relentless, Shylock
bargain, with female dependence,—oh, that is a feeling out of their
creed, a something for the scribblers of romance and the writers of
profane verse to rave about !
Yet, doubtless, is “G. I.” a devout christian. Yes, sure we are,
that after a charity sermon at the Magdalen, he would meekly
hold the plate at the door, sweetly unconscious of the victims that
such as he, with their Pharisaic “piety,” drive to a soul and body-
killing commerce in the dreadful street.
Fashionable Intelligence.
The example set by the Ladies of Fashion, who are getting up a
Waverley Ball, will, we understand, befollowed by the dashing MRs. Fitz-
Jones, who intends giving a series of Quadrilles and Country Dances,
illustrative of some of the principal rules in MURRAY's Grammar. There
will be a grand tableau of the tenses, and a magnificent procession of the
moods, concluding with a reel by the degrees of coinparison, and a galop
by all the cases. A bolero by the pronouns is expected to prove very
effective, and it is understood that Lord BRough AM will be present as the
article indefinite.

A WALK WITH MY WIFE ;
OR, CONJUGAL RATES OF CONVEYANCE.
H ! never get
married, my
boy; never get
married, is the
admonition of
many an old
gentleman. I
do not say that.
I daresay there
are some rea-
sonable women
in the world :
if you can find
one, and like
her, marry her:
and probably
you will be
more comfort-
able, on the
whole, than if
you had re-
mained single.
Recollect, how-
ever, that ma-
trimony has
- its troubles.
The chief of these is its expense. For double-blessedness you must pay a
double price. Marriage involves chop plus chop, steak plus steak,
tailor's bill plus milliner's, at least; mind that. This is domestic felicity
on the cheapest terms.
When you marry, if you have more money than you know what to do
with, go and live anywhere ; in Belgrave-square if you please. But
otherwise, if you possibly can, take a little place in the country, Depend
upon it that a cottage near a wood is eligible upon other than sentimental
grounds. Not only are rambles through avenues and green lanes pleasant
and salubrious in themselves; but, mark l—there are no shops on either
side of you. -
ARABELLA and I, before we were married, used to be constantly taking
long walks into the country. Above us was the blue firmanent; around us
were hill and dale, fields, flowers, trees, meandering streams, rippling
brooks, cows, sheep, and other animals; all pleasing to behold. We
returned home in high spirits, and with a good appetite, both of us. We
had enjoyed ourselves greatly, and were no poorer than when we set out.
After marriage, my avocations compelling me to reside in town,
ARABELLA began gradually to lose her taste for scenery, and to take to
staying within doors, in consequence of which she became unwell. Our
medical man recommended exercise ; and I was obliged to insist on her
walking out with me.
I will not say where we live; because I am not writing for my wife's
edification, but for that of the readers of Punch. We took a walk yester-
day. Proceeding at a moderate pace, in about twenty minutes we found
ourselves in Oxford-street, near Regent-circus.
Here my wife, feeling herself a little tired and out of breath, declared
she could go no further. So we stopped 5–opposite to one of those real
nuisances to husbands—a linendraper's shop, with windows of enormous
panes, and a heap of I know not how much finery, of all sorts and colours
in the same ; a regular wife-gin or lady-trap. Man-traps are abolished ;
and I am sure these ought to be.
I tried to direct ARAbella's attention to the wood-pavement; it was of
no use : she was fascinated by that window ; and there she stood, like a
parish-boy before a dining-room larder. I feared how it would be, and
so it was. I was victimised for a thing that shone and glistened and
ehanged colour in different lights; she called it a shot-silk—I wish the
man had been shot who put it there.
My wife now felt wonderfully recovered ; as able to walk, in fact, as
when we set out. Finding this, I proposed going up Portland Place to
the Regent's Park, where, if we wished, we might get a seat. But ARA-
BELLA was confident that she should require no such thing, and preferred
turning down Regent Street. After another stage of about thirty yards,
she wanted to rest herself again; this time it was opposite to a jeweller's ;
of which the consequence was her purchasing some ear-rings, and my
paying for them. She remarked, as we recommenced our journey, that
she could get on very well by going short distances at a time, and then
stopping for a moment. . So it appeared ; but after passing a shop where
there was a very rich shawl which she admired, she seemed to proceed
with much difficulty.
At about the middle of Regent Street, ARABELLA thought that by the
time we got back she should have had walking enough. I suggested that
we might extend our steps to the Quadrant. Whereat she fairly bargained
with me, in case of her so far exerting herself, for a certain love of a
bonnet which she had lately seen there, and which she knew would be
gone if she did not get it now. As this would not quite ruin me, and as
my wife, if any desire of her’s is ungratified, is generally out of temper
for some days, I censented to get it for her.
I wish my wife and other ladies would come to an understanding with
their husbands, as to rates of travelling and conveyance; as thus ;-
For One mile . . . . 3 Yards Ribbon.
Two do. . . . . 1 Pair Silk Stockings.
Three do. . - - 1 Pelisse do.
Four do. . . . . . l Boa.
Five do. - - . . 1 Muff, &c.
But I must not talk of muffs, I suppose, after the above confession.
However, I shall manage better in future. I do not object to ladies being
properly remunerated for their trouble in walking out with their hus-
bands; but the latter, on the principles of common prudence, should know
what they have to pay beforehand.
OXFORD PRIZE POEM.
E have been favoured with the follow-
ing poem, which we believe is the one
that gained the prize at Oxford. We
have only to say that if it did not it
should have done, for when we see the
sort of literary comicalities that gain
prizes we think the following must be
quite good enough to have obtained
university honours. The Prize Comedy
seems to have been selected as if it had been a prize ox, by the weight.
The subject of the Oxford Prize Poem is the
BATTLE OF THE NILE.
Loud booms the cannon o'er the quarter deck,
And Nelson feels 'tis nothing now or neck.
Behold the busy bomb and active shell
Strike where their fatal force is sure to tell.
The gallant Nelson draws his shining sword,
Victory, victory ! is now the word.
Now screams the terrified marine with dread,
While the brave tar defies the hissing lead.
Broadsides and bullets, cutlasses and shots,
IIe spurns, though even death his keen eye dots.
A fatal rifle from a hostile bark,
Now makes immortal NElson its sure mark.
A carpenter beside him weeping kneels,
A faithful bos'un drunk before him reels,
While Collingwood hastes with the hostile flag,
To dress the wound—proud substitute for rag.
Neptune perceiving war has done its work,
Leans mournfully on his inverted fork,
Britannia and the Tritons sit and weep
Into the bosom of the briny deep.
The seagull gives a screech, as if 'twould say,
England has lost its hope, but won the day.
Even the very dolphins cease their sport,
Appearing wrapt in melancholy thought.
The whale his value doth unwitting spoil,
Curdling to very vinegar his oil.
And England weeps for a tremendous while
The memory of the Battle of the Nile.
MORAL.
Ye gallant admirals—ye noble tars,
Who seek in battle glory's frightful scars,
Take warning by immortal Nelson's fate,
And seek the cabin, ere it is too late.
SAxon Y in DANGER.
we understand it has been thought necessary to appoint three of the
police force to attend continually on the King of Saxony, to protect hº
Majesty from the invincible politeness of Sir Peter Laurie.

PUNCH'S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER I.
FROM A LADY. INQUIRING THE CHARACTER OF A SERVANT,
MADAM,
BRidget DustER having applied
to me for a place of maid-of-all-work, I
beg to learn of you, as her last mistress,
her fitness for the serious responsibilities
of that situation. Having suffered so
much from the impertinence and wicked-
ness of servants—(I have often thought
they were only sent into this world to
torment respectable people), you will, I
am sure, forgive me if I appear some-
what particular in my inquiries. Ex-
perience, madam, has made me circum-
spect. There was a time when I thought
all the world as good and honest as
myself; but house-keeping wipes the
bloom from the human heart, and makes
us lock our tea-caddies.
I have kept house for five-and-twenty years, in which time I have
constantly endeavoured to find a servant who should be without a
fault; yet, though I have given eight pounds a year with tea and
sugar, would you believe it !—I have never once succeeded. How-
ever, I must say it, I like the face of BRIDGET ; I never saw a deeper
small-pox. As for handsome servants, I never have 'em : they
always think more of their faces than their fire-irons, and are pucker-
ing up their mouths at the looking-glass when they should be rubbing
the door-plate. Curls, too, I never suffer to cross my threshold. I
know more than one instance in which curls have destroyed the
peace of a family. For my money, a servant can't be too plain : in a
word, I think ugliness to be a sort of cheap livery intended by nature
for maids-of-all-work—it keeps 'em in their proper place, and pre-
vents’em thinking of foolishness. So far, BRIDGET's looks are most
satisfactory.
And now, ma'am, for the article of dress. Servants have never
been servants since linsey-woolsey went out. It makes my very flesh
creep to see 'em flaunting about, for all the world as if they were
born to silk gowns and open-work in their stockings. I hare seen a
housemaid go out for the day with a parasol 1 I prophesied her end,
and—poor wretch 1–so it came about. What I have suffered, too,
from such presumption I once had a creature who copied every
new cap I had, violating my best feelings under my own roof
BRIDGEt looks a humble dresser, fit for a kitchen ; I trust she is so.
I hope, however, she is sober. When servants are very plain,
they sometimes, to revenge themselves on nature, fly to drink. This
is shocking; for with such people, with all one's locking and bolting,
one's brandy is never safe.
In the next place, does BRIDGET break 1 Not but what I always
make my servants pay for all they destroy ; still, they can't pay for
one's nerves. Again, there is this danger—they may break beyond
their wages.
Is BRIDGET honest ? Pray, madam, be particular on this point, for
I have been much deceived. I once took a servant with the finest
character for honesty; and, only a week afterwards, detected her
giving three cold potatoes to a little hurdy-gurdy foreigner with
white mice.

vant who answers is my abomination. It is clearly flying in the
face of the best interests of society. Surely, people who pay wages
have a right to find what fault they please; it is the natural privi-
lege that marks the mistress from the maid. I would have a severe
law to punish a servant who answers—even if right.
Is BRIDGET an early riser, without any reference to the time she
may be allowed to go to bed A good maid-of-all-work should, so to
speak, be like a needle, and always sleep with one eye open.
Has BRIDGET any followers ? Such creatures I never allow. I
conceive that a servant ought to be a sort of nun, and, from the
moment she enters your house, should take leave of all the world
beside. Has she not her kitchen for willing hands always to do
something in And then for company, doesn’t she see the butcher,
the baker, the dustman—to say nothing of the sweeps
Is BRIDGET industrious—is she clean I hope, for the poor crea-
ture's sake, that you may be able to answer these few questions to
my satisfaction, when BRIDGEt may immediately bring her boxes
Is Bai DGET civil Will she bear wholesome reproof? A ser-
With me, her duties will be few, but they must be punctually per-
formed. Indeed, I require a servant to consider herself a sort of
human kitchen clock. She must have no temper, no sulks, no flesh-
and-blood feelings, as I’ve heard impudent hussies call their airs and
graces, but must go as regularly through her work as though she was
made of steel springs and brass pullies. For such a person, there is
a happy home in the house of
Your obedient Servant,
PAMELA Squaw.
LETTER II.
FROM A SERVANT, INQUIRING THE CHARACTER OF A MISTRESS.
DEAR Molly,
FINDING that you're in place next door to Mrs. Squaw,
and remembering what friends we used to be when both of us lived
with the pastry-cook, I have thought fit to write to you to inquire
about your neighbour. It’s all very fine, Molly, for mistresses to
haggle about the characters of their maids, but surely we poor
servants have as much right to ask the characters of our mistresses.
However, folks who pay wages will always have the upper hand in
this world, whatever to our comfort may happen to 'em afterwards.
I thank my stars I don’t judge of people by their looks, otherwise
I wouldn't go into MRs. Squaw's kitchen, if it was made of gold;
she’s dreadful ugly, to be sure, but I don't despise her for that, if
her temper's sweet. I can't bear a mistress that's always nagging
and magging. A good noise, once in a way, I don't mind—it brisks
up one's blood; but I have known mistresses always pushing their
words at you and about you, as if they were sticking pins in a cushion
with no flesh and blood.
How does she like her maids to dress Mind, I don’t insist on
ringlets in the house, but when I go out, I’m my own mistress. I'vo
given up two places for my bird-of-paradise feather—it looks quite
alive in my white chip !—and would give up twenty. After slaving
among pots and pans for a month, it is so sweet to be sometimes
taken for a lady on one's Sunday out.
And now, dear Molly, tell me truly; does MRs. Squaw drink
I have lived in one family where the mistress kept a bottle in a thing
that looked for all the world like the covering of a book. No wages
should make me do this again ; and—perhaps I am wrong—but,
looking at Mas. SQUAw, I thought I never saw a redder nose.
When a mistress has such a habit, a poor girl's character is never
safe.
I’ve agreed to pay for all I break, but that I don't mind, as I
never break nothing—it's always the cat. But then I’ve known
mistresses mean enough to put off a cracked basin on a poor servant.
What is MRs. Squaw's character for crockery
MRs. Squaw asked me if I had any followers, as she allowed of
no such thing. I said—and truly, Molly—that I had nobody that
followed me; but, Molly, there is a young man that I have followed
these two years, and will, so long as I’ve eyes to stare and limbs to
move. Such a sweet creature—six feet one inch and a half without
his boots I Such a mustachio on his lip—such a delicate thing, just
the colour of a leech He's in the Life Guards, Molly ; quite a
building of a man. You can’t think how fond he is of me; for these
last two years he's smoked my wages in cigars. I lost one place
about him, and gloried in it ! It was one quarter-day, and he came
whistling about the area. Mistress saw his red coat, and ringing
the bell, asked me what I meant by harbouring a low soldier My
blood was up like ginger-beer. “It’s all very well for you, ma'am,”

says 1, “to say low soldier. But, ma'am,” says I, “you don't know
what it is to be courted by a Life Guardsman.”
Oh, these mistresses, Molly they think poor servants have no
more flesh and blood than a porridge-skillet. They can have their
comfortable courtings in their parlours and drawing-rooms; and
then, with their very toes at the fire, they can abuse a poor servant
for only whispering a bit of love, all among the snow, perhaps, in the
area. This is the treatment that often makes poor girls desperate,
and drives 'em to marriage long afore their time.
No followers, indeed 1 No ; they think that the cat and the kettle,
and the kitchen clock, are company enough for a poor servant.
They never think of us in the long winter nights, when they are
playing at cards, or chatting with folks who’ve dropt in—they never
think of us, all alone as we are, without a soul to speak to 1 No; we
must have no followers, though, perhaps, the parlour's ringing
again with laughter; and our only chance of opening our lips is the
chance of being sent out to get oysters for the company.
However, dear Molly, write me all you know about the character
of Mrs. Squaw : if she's sober, and gives civil words and regular
wages to her servants. I don't mind having her for a mistress, until
the sweet day arrives when I become a soldier's wedded lady.
Till then,
Believe me, your friend and old fellow-servant,
BRIDGET DUsTER.
THE KING OF SAXONY IN TROUBLE.
We think the readers of Punch will be very sorry when they learn
that the King of Saxony is likely to lose his throne. We have received
the intelligence from what we believe to be a most trustworthy quarter,
and whatever may be the anguish of our feelings, we are nevertheless
bound to make the news public.
It has for some time been known that a Congress is about to be held
somewhere in Germany during the approaching autumn. Many impor-
tant matters will be agitated in the crowned heads there, and when
assembled, SIR JAMEs GRAHAM will, we understand, forward a note pro-
posing a uniform government for all post-offices; so that the correspond-
ence of all civilised mankind may come under the knowledge of their
paternal rulers. It is feared, from what M. Guizot said a day or two ago,
that France will stand out; but there is no doubt that SIR JAMEs will have
the active advocacy of the ambassadors from Madagascar and Morocco.
However, our more immediate concern is with the KING of SAxoNY.
It is stated that at the Congress His Majesty will be impeached for con-
duct “unworthy of a king, and unbecoming a nobleman.” This charge
will be mainly supported by depositions taken in England, corroborative
of the very unkingly behaviour of Saxony during his sojourn with us.
Circumstances permit us to allude to only a part of the testimony that has
been taken in London, and will, at the Congress, be adduced against his
Majesty.
Signon LABLAche has deposed that his Majesty, although he was once
brought to the Opera, never presented the said Signor with a gold snuff-box,
diamond ring, tooth-pick, or indeed with the slightest testimonial of his
homage.
GENERAL ToM THUMB has also vehemently deposed that SAxony treated
him with the most marked contempt, never having even so much as
visited him. This conduct the General very justly considers as a most
uncourteous reflection upon other crowned and royal heads, with whom
his Dwarfship has been so worthy a favourite. This complaint of the
General will, it is feared, go far to damage his Majesty among his royal
brethren. We can only hope the best, but the case appears very serious
against him.
MDLLEs. CERito and CARLotta GR1s are both ready to depose on oath
that they have never received so much as a bunch of violets from his
Majesty,
MADAME Tussaud has also proved, that although the King of Saxoxy
visited Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's, he never had the common
civility to drop in at Upper Baker Street: whereas PRINCE ALBERT
knows better what is due to the interests of pure art.
It is also affirmed by BARoN NATHAN that his Majesty has been heard
to speak in contemptuous terms of the Polka.
In addition to these grave charges, there is, we regret to say, strong
proof that his Majesty, during his sojourn in London, was visiting museums,
and libraries, and churches, and behaving, indeed, rather like a low phi-
losopher who travels for vulgar curiosity, than as a monarch who, if he
knows himself, ought to be above such things. It is known that the KING
of Saxony is a great botanist, and we regret to say that he shows much
more interest in the cullitig of chickweed and pimpernel than in the cul-
tivation of laurel. It is believed that many other facts will come out
before the Congress, which it is feared will go far to endanger the throne
of Saxony. It is believed, in the best circles, that he will be deposed for,
as we have premised, conduct unworthy of a king and a nobleman.
We would advise the PRINCE of DENMARK to take care of himself.
Here has he come from Denmark to Scotland and the Faroe Isles, with
nothing but a geologist's hammer, to chip and chip at rocks and stones.
Rudely s .# the Opera and ALMAck's, he has, like a boorish Dane,
occupied himself with felspar and quartz.
AN IRREGULAR ECLIPSE OF THE MOON.
It is well known that the King of Saxony paid a visit to Newgate, and
MR. Moon “attended in his place”—as the Parliamentary phrase goes—
to let his Majesty into the secrets of the prison-house. Mr. SHERiff
Musgrove was also present on the occasion, and a consultation took place
between the two Sheriffs as to the proper method of behaving in the pre-
sence of royalty. Moon, who is a tremendotis stickler for etiquette,
insisted on walking backwards—a departure, by-the-by, from his usual
custom, which is to push himself forwards in a manner most unscrupulous.
Musgrove, who is a discreet Sheriff, determined that he would not
“back” through the vaulted passages of Newgate for any sovereign
breathing; and he therefore kept sensibly but respectfully at Saxony's
side, while Moon went through a scene of slavish pantomime, in the
course of which he now and then executed a dos-à-dos with a stone but-
tress, or was brought up suddenly, with an involuntary bow, by a knock
on the back of the head from a bit of coping, or a piece of projecting
cornice. Nevertheless, Moon “bore it with a patient shrug,” and an
occasional rub of the hand to
allay the anguish, till he got
into a wide passage, the unob-
structed aspect of which, as
he backed along it, inspired
him with the fullest confidence.
His air became almost jaunty,
and he was executing a sort
of courtly pastorale a few paces
in advance of the King and
Mr. Sheriff Musgrove, when
suddenly, the Moon became
nearly eclipsed, nothing being
visible but his face and his
heels, which were in an instant
out of sight, and Musgrove,
springing forward, perceived
his unhappy colleague at the
bottom of a flight of stone
steps, down which he had backed with a sort of frisky recklessness. Had
the King followed his officious cicerone, his Majesty would indeed have
been shown “over” Newgate in a manner that would have been com-
plete, at least, if not satisfactory.
LORD DENMAN IN DANGER.
Lond DENMAN spoke nobly in the Lords, on the conduct of SIR JEMMY
TwitchER GRAHAM, eloquently denouncing the Post Office Jack Sheppard.
Whereupon BRough AM, with all his modesty upon him, rose and said:–
“If anything could make the noble and learned lord more dear to the
people of England or to himself, it was the declaration which he had made.”
We earnestly intreat Lord DENMAN to mind what he is about. It is im-
possible that the people of England can value him more highly than they
do ; but if he make himself “dear” to Lond BRough AM, he is lost.
A QUADRUPLE ALLIANCE.
The Sloth, which has just arrived in this country, is described to have
jour stomachs. He has four good reasons to congratulate himself, then,
that the Zoological Gardens is not a Poor Law Union.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 15
THE LAST STAGE OF TEMPERANCE.
f The Manager of the Victoria Theatre, whose personal sacrifices in the
cause of morality are of the most unprecedented kind, has produced a
new drama, the object of which is to excite the spirit of pure teatotalism
in the breasts of the New Cut-ians, a race long devoted to gin, and those
bitters by which it is too often accompanied. “The Temperance Pledge”
is a drama of intense interest, and depicts the moral struggle between
neat wines on the one hand, and unadulterated Mocha on the other. The
workings of beer on a guilty conscience are prominently put forward,
while the four-and-ninepenny mixed is exhibited in the light of a stimulant
to honest exertion, and is strongly recommended to families through the
mouth of the hero of the drama. Allitteration seems to favour the moral
of the piece, for Rum and Ruin, Brandy and Beggary, Wine and Want
seem to be naturally connected; while Happiness and Hyson would sug-
est a line in the bill, which ought to terminate a grand tableau of Spirits
§. and Tea Triumphant 1
We understand that in order to preserve the strictest propriety in the
getting up of this piece, and that everything may be in perfect keeping,
the actors have all been compelled to take the pledge from week to week
during the run, and the manager also pledges himself that the usual cry
of “bottled porter,” which is heard between the acts, shall on no account
be permitted. The refreshment-sellers are instructed to offer only “apples,
oranges, tea, coffee, bread and butter, or bill of the play,” to the audience,
who are thus compelled to “assume teatotalism, thqugh they have it not,”
during the performance. The author of the piece has been inspired with
the general tone of the subject, for his sentiment is the purest milk and
water. The fact that the actors are most of them Fº and that the
tea-pot is their favourite attitude, must be regarded as heightening the
effect of the drama.
G00D-When A Little Punch is TAKEN.
- We must, however, call the manager's attention to the horrible destruc-
tion of the illusion, occasioned by the money-taker at the box-door, who
sits with a glass of brandy-and-water under the till, from which the
immoral liquid is occasionally brought forth, to the utter horror of the
visitors.
TEN MINUTES ADVICE ON THE FACE AND HANDS.
BY THE CLOCK OF ST. CLEMENT'S.
UESTIoNING my past bitter experience, I am
enabled to speak most feelingly of the dis-
advantages arising from a neglect of the
Face and Hands. I publish my observa-
tions for the benefit of the unfortunate Dial
at the Royal Exchange, and the Clock at
Windsor, which seem to have been born
to those very defects which almost banished
me from the Circle of Clocks, and sent me
—not before my time, but considerably after
it—to the lowest scale of degradation. The
Face and Hands are, or ought to be, very
closely connected, and any well-regulated clock need not be ashamed to
show 3. Face if his Hands are in a fit state to meet the eye of the public.
A sudden jerk of the Hand should always be avoided : it is not grace-
ful; and it is almost impossible to avoid going too far. It should always
be the aim of a Clock to keep its Hands on the move, but this should
be done so gently as to be almost imperceptible. , Small Hands are
considered a sign of good breeding among human beings; but among
Clocks it is quite the reverse, for with them the largest Hands are gener-
ally to be remarked in those which occupy the highest position.
Though these observations are principally directed to the Hands and
Faces of Clocks, the Figures ought to be on no account neglected. Every
Clock should learn how to divide its time, and it will then be sure to find
one pair of Hands quite sufficient to get through all that is expected of it.
The complexion is a matter of some importance in the face of a clock; and
nothing is more destructive than the affectation of delicacy of colour, which
is to be observed in the Clock of St. James's, Westminster, as well as in
that of the Horse Guards, both of which clocks betray, by their ghastly
appearance at night, the horrible effects of late hours. Their Faces,
immediately after dark, become almost transparent with a sort of lurid
light; aud there is a kind of false brilliancy imparted by the artificial
means which are taken to keep their Faces presentable to the public at
all hours of the night. The healthy hue on the Face of St. Paul's, though
somewhat dingy, presents a striking contrast to the consumptive com-
plexion of St. James's, and some other clocks, whose names I refrain
from mentioning, lest I bring into their faces a Blush which might prove
injurious to their reputation. In conclusion, I beg to extend to all my

The sentiments put forth on a recent occasion, by several of the
members of the University, have suggested the probability that a few
Moral Songs might be found very acceptable to the gentlemen of Oxford.
We therefore present the following specimen:—
A bill for a hundred come discount for me,
I'll half of it take in champagne;
No matter what wine, so some cash there should be,
(Aside)—For you'll ne'er get your money again.
And oh when the date of the bill is gone by,
When lawyers and bailiffs distress him,
The promise of payment is then all his eye :
Here's a health to i. Doo, God bless him 1
The swindlers of old, in their pleadings, we're told,
When at those who had trusted they laugh'd,
Put pleas that were sham, with effrontery bold,
The more costly to render the draft.
My plea's in my pocket—'tis empty, alas !
Of that plea none can e'er dispossess him ;
Upstanding, uncovered, round round let it pass,
Here's a health to the Doo, God bless him

The second Appearance of Sir Robert Peel's Notorious Dancing Dogs. -
BLENHEIM GARDENS.–PRICE FIVE SHILLINGS.
A CoahEspondent of The Times writes of his late pilgrimage to Blen-
heim, wherein the Duke of MARLBoRough—like a very small mouse
in a very large cheese—keeps his solitary state. The pilgrim complains
that the Duke's Scotch gardener insisted upon receiving five shillings for
snowing the DUKE's Eden; and, when remonstrated with, shut the
gate in the faces of some ladies. Poor man we wonder not at his
aptitude at shutting gates in the faces of ladies—has he not had high
instruction ?
The garden tickets are signed by the proprietor, by MARLBorough
himself, who deputes a Scotchman to take the money. Holding the said
gardens from the public, the Duke is, of course, doubly justified in
making the public pay for the exhibition. And then, what a small sum
is five shillings compared with the rare and delicious thoughts which
perforce throng the brain, dreaming in the gardens of the Duke of
MARLBoRough All truly great minds, from Dioclet IAN to Lord
Bacon, and so by natural progression to MARLBohough, have delighted
in gardens; all, too, have had some peculiar way of manifesting that
delight. Bacon wrote garden essays; MARLBorough writes garden
tickets, price five shillings
Have we really visited Blenheim gardens, or was it only in some day-
dream that we beheld the spot where the great Chunchill, of 1844,
walks and meditates for his country's good; where, sweetly smitten by
the loveliest aspects of a bountiful nature, his heart is wont to gush with
that abounding love for all men which has made his name sweet as
manna in the mouths of the poort No : surely we have been at Blenheim.
Yes, it all throngs upon our memory; we remember every word that the
Scotchman said to us, as he showed us about the place—yes, we can
repeat every syllable.
“Here,” said he, “is the Duke's bower, where he sometimes sits for
hours in a deep study. And then he will go into his library, summon his
steward, and send him on some errand of charity to Woodstock.
“Here, too, in this wilderness of roses, he will walk early in the
morning. And I have often seen his Grace (when he thought nobody
was near him) clasp his hands together, and look gratefully up at Heaven—
sometimes wipe a tear, I assure you, sir, a tear—from his eye, and then
smile so, it was a delight to the heart to look upon him 1 He seemed
like a man giving thanks for all the good that God had given him. After
this, somehow or the other, the poor would be sure to hear of him.
“Now, look here, sir. You can't believe the bushels and bushels of
peaches sent from these trees to the folks of Woodstock every autumn
by the Duke. “They’re not much, FERGuson’—my name's FERGuson,
sir, “they're not much, the DUKE will say, “but they’ll shew I don't
forget my neighbours.' And then, bless you ! if he hears that anybody
is sick, why I’ve known him come down himself and choose the very
finest grapes to send to 'em. Ha, sir! nobody knows the good the Duke
does But how, indeed, could anybody help it, living in such a paradise
of gardens !”
We could not but acknowledge the truth of FERGuson's words. It
is plain, we thought, that here the Duke cultivates the laurels that have
made him glorious. With such thoughts, conscious that to a mind sof-
tened and disciplined by a contemplation of nature in her loveliest looks,
we owe the virtues that so distinguish the Duke, what, we exclaimed
in our enthusiasm, what price can be too much to visit Blenheim
Gardens !
And an Irish echo answered—“Five Shillings f"

AFFLICTIONS OF THE ARISTOCRACY.
It used to be generally considered that gout was the prevalent com-
plaint of the peerage, but certain advertisements would seem to indicate
that the English nobles are martyrs to corns, and that all their feet are
in the hands of the chiropaedists. Messrs. LENT AND Eisenberg are
engaged in a desperate struggle for the toes of the aristocracy, and he
carries off the palm who can get the largest number of patrician soles or
heels within his clutches. . Both of these great operators are great in the
science of extraction, for they generally extract a testimonial as well as a
corn from their lordly customers.
A HINT FOR MOSES.
MR. Punch, Baker Street, June 15, 1844.
Passing by the eminent establishment of E. AARoN AND
Co., the great European tailors of the City, I was naturally attracted
(along with hundreds of others) to examine the beauteous objects of
gent.'s attire, which are exhibited in their unrivalled plate-glass
windows. 'Tis a sight indeed worthy of inspection. And not a little
amusing was it to the observer of human mature, which I flatter
myself I am, to mark the various passions of delight and surprise
exhibited in the countenances of the myriads thronging round the
establishment.
One couple specially engaged my attention: a gentleman in a green
coat and mahogany coloured top-boots, evidently fresh from the
º

country, held in his hand a little boy, who no doubt was his son.
This simple pair were evidently more astonished and charmed than
any persons there.
The following dialogue took place between them :—
Country Gentleman. §. lod, we've seen Loonun thro' a'most ;
but ifackins we've seen noothin loike this.
Boy: No, dear papa, this is indeed a galaxy of splendour to which
the other magnificences of this proud metropolis bear no parallel.
Country Gentleman. Why them windows is as big as our turnip-
field !
Boy. Ay, dear sir, and I think the coats and vests within are more
lovely than any of the flowers in our favourite meadow.
Country Gentleman. What would they say in tº village to see thee in
. a coat as that, my lod? Ai’m blest if moother would knaw.
thee I
Boy. Dearest father, 'tis hard to deceive the keen eyes of a parent,
and my mamma would recognise her boy in any guise; but I think
with you she would rejoice to see her child attired in one of the
AARon's fashionable suits.
Country Gentleman. Doost think so Well, thou art a good lad, and
ecod thou shalt have un 1
Boy. How, how shall I ever prove my gratitude to the best of
fathers?
Mr. Aaron (who happens to be looking out of the window). Pray
walk in, gentlemen ; I think, Sir John, I can suit the young gentle-
man to a nicety.
The celebrated tailor, the country baronet, and his interesting boy
here walked into the shop, and I could not but look with pleased
interest as the eminent artist took the measure of the young fellow.
MR. A.A.Ron's aspect was deliciously benevolent; the country
baronet (for such, I am given to understand, was his rank) looked on
at the scene with all a parent's pleasure, and when the operation of
measuring was concluded, MR. A.A.Ron bowed his customers out of
the shop with infinite politeness, promising to be punctual with the
clothes in Berkeley Square, next Tuesday.
Several persons had been spectators of the scene (for it took place
before the shop door, so that all the world might see it), and I have
no doubt many were attracted by the exhibition, and determined to
bring their own children to the Emporium.
Well sir, 'twas my lot some days after to have a second occasion
to visit the Majories (where MR. AARoN’s shop is) and at about the
same hour of the day, when the busy throng crowd thickest in that
commercial quarter.
I was amazed to remark gazing into MR. AARoN's window another
country gentleman and another son, and their conversation began.
Country Gentleman. Wawns lod, we're seen Loonun thro' a'most; but
ifackins we're seen noothin loike this.
Boy. No, papa, this is indeed a galary of splendour, &c.
Gracious heavens ! they were the pair I had seen on the previous
day ! The same dialogue was gone through—the same AARon came
to the door and welcomed the rustics, and, having measured the
young one, bowed them out, and promised to be punctual in Berkeley
Square as usual 1 |
I make no comment, but my opinions of human nature are by no
means so favourable as they were before that second visit to the
Majories.
Your obedient Servant,

P R O S P E C T US
OF THE LOTTERY FOR WATERLOO BRIDGE.
Heinous Humbug and Company,
AGENTs for the celebrated HEINEs, of Hamburg, have received Instruc-
tions from
ROMEO COATES, ESQUIRE,
And the other Proprietors, to undertake the very desirable office of
getting rid of
Waterloo Bridge by Way of Lottery.
The Bridge will be disposed of in a million shares, of one pound each, and
in order to
inSURE A PRIZE TO EVERY TICKET. HOLDER
It has been determined to divide the waste bricks under the dry arches into
ONE MILLION LOTS,
Which will be delivered to each subscriber on his having paid his pound,
and produced his receipt as a voucher. To prevent confusion, the pound
must be paid immediately in London, and the receipt will be forwarded
from Germany at an early opportunity. In addition to this
CERTAINTY OF A PRIZE,
It has been arranged to give to the public a chance of obtaining the
Bridge Itself,
Which will be divided for the purpose into arches; and the fortunate
holder of the centre arch, will find himself in possession of
The KEY-STONE TO FORTUNE.
Tickets for whole arches, º: of arches, or sixteenths of arches,
should apply without delay to Heinous HUMBug AND Company, who are
also authorised to dispose of

nature. For how it brings all sorts of men together How, when
its merits are the theme, does it make men forget the distinctions
of society, mixing up—as in familiar, family intercourse—the titled
and the untitled, the law-makers and the law-breakers, men of gold
and men of straw, the blushless brigands of the town, and the
pattern persons who make up the noble world !
Pleasant, too, is it to meditate on a LoRD BENTINck, touched by
equine influence, and dealing in horse-flesh like any brother with
“GLYNDE, the baker,” who, true to old associations, takes odds
against the MILLER.
Especially grateful, too, to the philanthropist is it to know that
though erring man may for his unfortunate iniquities be barred from
associating with his nicer brotherhood in the common paths of life—
there is, nevertheless, one place where universal tolerance may greet
him, if (forgetful of every other obligation towards the world,) he only
pays his bets. He may cheat his tradesmen ; indeed, he may draw the
daily breath of a swindler; or, what is worse, he may “clothe the
back and feed the maw" from the profits of the dice-box, or, fouler
still, from the stews, yet, if there be one virtue left him—the grace,
the one redeeming grace of paying his bets—he is “a fit member of
the ring; ” he is a gentleman by virtue of ready money ! Well, if
only for the sake of the noblemen who deal in horse-flesh and legis-
lation too, we earnestly hope that rascality, unlike the small-pox, is
not catching. Nevertheless, after reading Lond BENTINck's evidence,
we cannot but look upon the sporting aristocracy, in insurance
phraseology, as doubly hazardous.
FASHIONABLE MOVEMENTS.
In quarters, eighths, and sixteenths, according to the taste of the specu-
lator. Any individual taking four whole shares will be entitled uncon-
ditionally to a gas lamp, and the purchaser of eight sixteenths will receive
a kerb-stone, whatever may be the result of the lottery. It is confidently
asserted that there will be
No BLANKs,
Except on the profit side of the account books of the Company.
Due notice will be given of the drawing, which will take place at the
wheel at the toll-gate in London; but, in order to prevent confusion, the -
prizes will be declared only by
HRINoUs HUMBUG AND company,
At their offices in Germany, where the lucky arches and happy balustrades
will be legally assigned to the fortunate drawers.
-E
TOLERANCE OF THE BETTING-RING.
The Betting-Ring—we gather as much from the late evidence of
Lond George BeNTINck—like the infernal ring described by brain-
less skulls in Der Freischütz, admits of any company. No leg can be
too black to step into it. Rank and virtue, too, put off their dignity
in that magic circle; and, sweetly condescending, are familiar with
the moral unwashed; yea, with the unsavoury and foul-fingered of
the land.
“I have known the plaintiff's father”—(thus spoke Lohn Geonor
in the Court of Exchequer)—“some time, and betted with him while
he kept a “hell’ſ ”
“I have employed GLYNDE, the baker, in Regent-street, to take the
odds against Grey Miller.”—
“We [i.e. the Jockey Club] should not turn out a gaming-house
keeper, unless he did not pay his bets. . Whatever be the occupation and
pursuit of a man, he is a fit member of the Ring, if he pays his debts of
honour !”
We hear much of the cold dignity, the high exacting manners of
the English aristocracy towards the vulgar mass of Adam's starless
and ungartered children—nevertheless, the Turf affords one green
spot where all men are equal; where the “ hell-keeper,” whose pro-
fits are pillage in defiance of the law, may meet and shake hands with
the sporting maker of the statutes; where the midnight sharper may
“kiss his five fingers” to my lord, and with pleasant familiarity
book a mutual bet ! The turf supplies the true fuller's-earth, and
takes out all sorts of social stains. Cleansed by it, the foulest knave
suddenly becomes sweet company for Dukes and Marquises.
Burron has called the domestication of the horse the noblest
conquest of man. The horse itself-magnificent animal 1–has its

movement of the arm,

same time inclining the body forwards, raising the eye-brows, opening
the eyes, and elevating the angles of the mouth. N. B. The pavement
may be simultaneously scraped with the right foot.
2. On asking a Lady opposite you at dinner to take Wine.—Catching
the eye of the gentleman who sits next her, and executing a pantomimic
movement expressive of pouring fluid into a glass, by way of intimation
that you want him to fill hers; waiting till he has done so, and holding
your own, in the meanwhile, by the stem. Fixing your eyes with a
fascinating expression upon hers for a moment, then lowering them,
and with them your forehead, till your mouth approaches to within four
inches of your glass, which, having thus met it considerably more than
half-way, you then raise to your lips.
3. At the Opera.-During the chorus, or other uninteresting part of
the music, or during the whole of it, holding a double glass to your eyes,
and directing it by a succession of horizontal and perpendicular move-

and over again.
4. At a Lecture or a Sermon.—Reclining in an easy attitude, and
holding, in like manner, a single glass to your eye, through which to
continue gazing at the preacher or lecturer; or you may retain the
same in its place by the muscular action of the eye-brow.
5. At Almack's.-Placing the palm of your left hand gently on a lady's
waist, taking the tips of the fingers of her left in your right, and describing
a series of gyrations round the room; or prancing thereabout in concert
with the lady, and alternately kicking up your heels under your coat

LEGAL INTELLIGENCE.
he young MR. BRIEFLEss, we understand, is
in treaty with the trustees of the Sessions
House at Westminster for a series of musi-
cal entertainments, under the title of “LEGAL
Evenings.” The first performance will
comprise
A Night with Eldon,
of which we have been favoured with the
following Programme.
PART I.
Eldon and his Father.—Curious Scene
on board a Coal-barge.—Solemn Declara-
tion of the future Chancellor that wool,
...stead of coals, shall fill the sack he is destined for.
Song.—Believe me, if all those mysterious pleas
Life at College.—The Sighs of a Sizer.
Song.—Amo, amas.
Keeping Terms.-Eating one's way to Eminence.—The Call to the Bar.
SoNo. –Roley poley, 9ammon and spinuch.
Between the First and Second Parts will be exhibited a series of Dis-
solving Views, in the course of which an allegorical representation of a
splendid fortune will gradually dissolve into the Court of Chancery.
PART II.
How to rise to Eminence.—Going at it Right and Left.—Sides of no
eonsequence.
- Song.-The Pendulum.
The Motion of Course.—Here we go up, up, up.–Wool-gathering.—
More Motions and Pro-motions.—Hey for the Woolsack 1–"Turn round
three times.”—Huzza 'tis gained :
Song.—We're all doubling.
Such are a few of the leading heads of the new legal entertainment.
If it should be successful, it is in contemplation to get up a Night with
Blackstone, as well as a miscellaneous selection of varied hours, introducing
a few minutes with Coke, Chitty, Archbold, and Petersdorff. The popular
abridgment of the latter will be arranged for fifteen voices, each voice
being of a certain volume ; so that the fifteen volumes would harmonise
most delightfully.
PUNCH TO LORD BROUGHAM AND WAUX.
ENRY, Lord BRough AM,
“When a poet wants to make him-
for a throat of iron, and for ninety-nine
move tongues than he has been provided
with by Nature ; in short, for nearly as
much tongue as your Lordship has. -
“Now, my Lord, I wish you to hear
me. Such is the unfortunate deafness to
common sense, and, I may add, humanity,
that you have of late been troubled with,
that a simple chalybeate larynx, and a
poor hundred tongues, will not suffice for
my purpose. I must have Seven Thousand
ToNgues, my Lord, and a throat composed
of that metal, which, in figurative but
popular language, is said to be the material of your Lordship's phy-
siognomy.
“Those seven thousand tongues, my Lord, I would borrow from the seven
thousand debtors now, thanks to your Lordship, confined in the gaols of
England. And then, with the voice of a multitude, I would roar in your
Lordship's ear that pithy little exclamation of Sterne's starling—‘I can't
et out.”
g “You would be unmoved, perhaps, by my roaring. You do not know
what it is to be shut up, except politically, which you must own you
decidedly are. Well, then I would aggravate my roar. I would roar
you as gently as any sucking dove. I would roar you an 'twere any
nightingale. I would say, “Kind Lord Brough AM, sweet LoRo
Brough AM, benevolent Lord BRough AM and WAUx You know very
well that in opposing Lond CoTTENHAM's motion for the Abolition of

Imprisonment for Debt, and causing the postponement of its consideration
to the next session, you had no sort of practical end in view. You are
conscious that you were actuated simply by that little weakness which is
constantly making you troublesome and ridiculous; the propensity to
interfere and meddle. Do, pray, for once, practise a little self-denial.
I know it is pleasant to you to gratify your vanity. I am aware how
delightful it is to you to render yourself conspicuous. You need not tell
me how fond you are of having a finger in every pie. But consider, now,
whether, in this instance, it is not worth while to be quiet. Multiply one
year's individual suffering—bitter suffering—by seven thousand ; and
then ask yourself, conscientiously, whether your mere transient gratifica-
tion ; the gratification, too, of a whim—a crotchet—is to be weighed
against it?”
“You have been doing nothing lately, my Lord, in the thoroughfare of
legislation, but creating obstructions. Hear Reason, in the language of a
policeman, desiring you to move on. You are worse than any apple-
woman in Cheapside on Lord Mayor's day. You are something more
than an inconvenience; I might almost say you are a nuisance. Do you
know what people say of you? They declare that you are the property
of his Grace the Duke of WELLINGTon ; and whenever any useful measure
is impeded in the House of Lords, if the cause of its arrest be questioned,

A FRAGMENT—COMPOSED IN A DREAM.
BY A. Tennyson.
In Hungerford did some wise man
A stately bridge of wire decree,
Where Thames, the muddy river, ran,
Down to a muddier sea.
Above the people rose its piers,
Their shadows on the waters fell ;
Year after year, for many years,
All unapproachable !
And filmy wires through tether spread,
From such proud piers' unfinished head,
Kept up a mild communication,
• Worthy of their exalted station;
And many gazers far below,
Waſted by the waveless tide,
Which 'neath those slender wires did flow,
Upturned their eyes and sighed—
* If that air bridge,” they whispered low,
“Wos broad enough to let us pass,
We’d not av so much round to go,
As now we av-alas!”
In vain their sighs, in vain their tears,
May blow and flow for many years 1
No mortal man may cross the cord
That crosses Thames at Hungerford
Its wondrous span to me doth seem
The bridge described in MIRza's dream
On which the good alone might tread,
Whilst others fell and perished.
Alas, in modern Babylon,
There's not a soul that can pass over ;
No, not a single holy one,
Endowed with virtue to discover
The step by which to tread the ridge
Of Hungerford's aerial Bridge 1

THE HERO OF WATERLOO.
Albion's brave troops were some in bed,
And some in giddy waltzes led,
Allured by Beauty's charms,
When suddenly the tocsin rang.
And loud was heard the trumpet's clang,
And Brussels was in arms.
The sentry at the chamber door,
Heard Britain's chieftain loudly snore,
So at the door he rapt.
“Now please your grace don coat and boot,
The enemy are all en route,
While we all thought they napt.”
“A horse 1" was all the warrior said;
A horse was brought, and from his bed
He leapt upon his back.
His movement it was so alert,
He strode the charger in his shirt,
But did not clothing lack.
For with a soldier's ready thought,
The coverlet he wisely brought
That lately decked his bed,
Which round his shoulders careless thrown,
Gave tout ensemble quite his own,
And thus his squadrons led.
Nor saddle strode across his steed
Nor surcingle nor stirrups need,
A horseman like his grace,
A horsecloth on the charger's back,
He sat as close as any sack,
Nor feared to lose his place.
With oaken cudgel in his hand
He brav'd the Frenchman's serried band,
He wanted not a sword.
Where'er he rode death scattered round,
The foe upon the gory ground,
He conquered in a word.
But should'st thou doubt my wondrous song,
And think it spins the yarn call'd long,
Seek London's Royal Bourse ;
And mark the Chieftain ride again,
With rolling-pin and counterpane,
High seated on his horse.

INTERESTING MEETING.
ON the opening of the Westminster Hall Exhi-
bition, on Monday, Punch and the Duke oz
WELLINgtoN were both present; and an im-
mense crowd followed the two noble lords round
the room. Both were looking remarkably well.
His Grace was dressed in his usual blue frock and
white trousers; while the noble Punch was in
his Sunday's, and not his Monday's attire—viz., a
claret-coloured frock coat and brass buttons; a
yellow vest, with vermilion under ditto ; a light
green satin stock, with a splendid garnet breast-
pin ; a white hat; shepherd-plaid trousers, with
rich worsted stripe; high-lows, and valuable brass-
mounted cane.
The crowd round the two venerable noblemen
was such as seriously to incommode them—the
noble Punch especially.
When they came before the Statue of a stat Es-
MAN, the noble Duke looked at the noble Punch,
the noble Punch looked at the noble Duke, and
both burst out laughing. It is needless to add,
that the Statesman represented was their mutual
friend Lond Brough AM. He appears between
two sleeping nymphs, in a dressing-gown, with a
fur collar (having removed the stock and shirt-
collar which he usually wears), and seemingly being
inclined to sleep.
“Egad it's the best thing he can do,” whispered
the noble Duke to the noble Punch, which caused
another burst of laughter from the latter good-
natured nobleman.
He was observed taking notes of some of the
most interesting pieces in the Exhibition, and
the public will, doubtless, have the benefit of
On his quitting the Exhibition,

The Liberality of the Landlords.
At a recent audit, MR. Tomkins returned ten per
cent on his rents to the tenantry. The circumstance
arose in the following manner:—The tenantry consists
of a second floor lodger, at 10 shillings a week. The
audit takes place every Monday morning, and one of
the shillings out of the ten having been discovered to
be a bad one, it was sent back again to the lodger,
being equivalent to a return of ten per cent on the

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
PART II.
CHAPTER THE SECOND.—OF INCORPOREAL HEREDITAMENTS.
t seems that Coke, in his pleasant squib on
Littleton—for surely he who throws a
light on another may do so by aiming a
squib at him—has described an incorporeal
hereditament as a right issuing out of a
thing corporate, whether real or personal ;
such as a rent issuing from land, which is
not the same as money got by raising, the
º
Vº wind, though rent is sometimes paid by
º resorting to the latter process.
ſº There are ten sorts of Incorporeal Here-
ditaments; so that they must be out of
sorts indeed, who have not the enjoyment
of any one of them.
The 1st is an advowson, or the right of
presentation to a church ; which would
indeed be an unsatisfactory kind of introduction if it applied only to
the church, instead of the good things connected with it. Advowsons
are of three kinds: 1st. Presentative, where the patron presents his
clerk to the bishop, who is expected to institute the said clerk, or rather
to “let him regularly in.” 2ndly. Collative, where the patron and bishop
are one, in which case Coke insists, in a lengthy chapter of eighty-six
pages, that “the bishop cannot present to himself unless he were one
beside himself, in which case he would be stark-staring mad; and, there-
fore, mon compos, and, reang de bishoppe de too.” 3dly. Donative, when
the King, or any subject, by his licence, has founded a church, which the
patron is allowed to give without presentation. “And this,” says SPEL-
MAN, “is an illustration of the patron's willy being superior to the bishop's
milly; the latter going for nil in opposition to the will of the former.”
Tithes form the second species of Incorporeal Hereditaments, though
a recent jurist says that tithes ought rather to be the tenth, because they
are the tenth part of the profit yearly arisingfrom lands.
Tithes are not payable on animals, ferae naturae, or, in other words, wild
beasts; so that the proprietors of the Zoological Gardens are not bound to
settle on the rector one in ten of all the tigers, bears, lions, or cassowaries,
that may be added within the year to the live stock alluded to.
Tithes are due to the parson, who is entitled to the tenth of almost
everything; and there is a case in the books, where a parson claimed the
Xth of a hogshead of XX, which he held must be equivalent to half,
because X is the half of XX.
There are three ways of being exempted from the payment of tithes:
namely, composition, custom, or commutation, to which some unprincipled
persons have occasionally added a fourth, by bolting and leaving the
tithes unpaid, to the extreme disgust and decided damnum of the parson.
A composition is where a parson makes hay while the sun shines, by
getting a good round sum in his own lifetime in discharge of the tithes
which would have been payable not only to himself but his successors—a
practice which savoured so much of covin towards future incumbents, that
a law was passed in the 13th of Elizabeth to prevent parsons and vicars
from making away with the property of their churches for more than
three lives or twenty-one years, a statute which consequently fixes seven
years as the average duration of human existence. Secondly, is a dis-
charge by custom, which is sometimes only a partial discharge, as where
the parson is accustomed to take the twelfth cock of hay instead of the
... in consideration of the hay being made for him, unless, indeed, the
parson be such a jolly old cock that he can make his own hay, un which
case the modus decimandi would not operate. Sometimes also the parson
accepts two fowls instead of a tenth of all the eggs, which is, in fact,
counting his chickens after they are hatched,—and the reduction is made
in consideration of the labour employed in sitting on the eggs; from the
risk and anxiety of which the parson thus saves himself.
3dly, Commutation, which provides that the parson shall take his
tithes in money, instead of rushing into poultry yards, and carrying off
one goose out of ten, or going personally into the hay-field and cocking a
cock or two into a cart for his own use; “a plan by which, it is true,”
says Fortescue, “he made cock-sure of his tithes, though at a sacrifice
of his dignity.”
The 3rd incorporeal hereditament is the Right of Common, which is
of four sorts, namely, pasture, piscary, turbary, and estovers. Common
of pasture is the privilege of turning out ducks and jackasses, or other ani-
mals, to indulge in the luxury of a meal of buttercups among a lot of boys
flying kites, pitching stones, or playing cricket in all directions. Common
of piscary is the right of fishing, which presents a curious contradiction to
the science of mathematics; for in fishing it requires only one line to make
an angle, while in mathematics two lines are required before an angle
can be formed. Common of turbary is a right of digging turf, but unless
it is for a lark, this right must be regarded as rather infra dig. Common
of estovers is the privilege of cutting wood from another's estate, though
Williams, J. has declared that any one cutting another person's wood
deserves to be made to cut his own stick with remarkable rapidity.
The 4th kind is that of Ways, or the right of going over another person's
ground, which is, in fact, the right of getting into the way of other people.
Offices form the 5th kind, such as the office of beadle; though tho
worthy beadle of the British Museum is himself anything but incorporeal.
Dignities constitute the 6th, and franchises the 7th sort of incorporeal
hereditaments. The former speak for themselves; but a franchise is a
branch of the royal prerogative existing in a subject; such as the right
of killing bucks, does, and roes, in a royal forest. Whether the does and
roes alluded to are the celebrated John and Richard, of legal celebrity,
we are not aware, and none of the jurists have helped to solve the
problem.
The 8th, 9th and 10th descriptions of incorporeal hereditaments are
corodies or the right of sustenance, which may be had at any respectable
workhouse; annuities, which must be well understood by those who enjoy
them, but are not worth the trouble of describing to those who don't ;
and rents, including rent-service, rent-charge, and a few others. Rent-
service has fealty attached to it, as where a policeman is put into an empty
house to let it—which, by-the-bye, he never thinks of attempting. A rent-
charge is a rent-payment charged upon land, with the power of distress—a
power which the law loveth to exercise, for distress is the very essence of
law in general. Rack-rent is rent of the full value of the tenement ac-
cording to some, but in the opinion of others it is thought that rack-rent
means a rent so high that the tenant is on the rack how to succeed in
getting it together.
RUNNING REIN MORALITY.
“Mihi quidem cogitanti,” as Lord Brough AM says.
The only moral that BARon Alderson elicits out of the Running Rein
case is one worthy of the plush rather than the ermine, and which would
come well from the lips of BARON JENkins.
“The trial has produced great regret and disgust in my mind. It has disclosed a
wretched fraud, and has shown noblemen and gentlemen of rank associating and betting
with men of low rank, and infinitely below them in society, in so doing, they have been
cheated and made the dupes of the greatest frauds. They may depend on it, it will
always be so, when gentlemen associate and bet with blackguards.”
This, as the poet affectingly remarks, is coming it a little too strong.
Does the Baron mean that gentlemen never cheat Is all that work done
by us vulgar ! Did he ever hear of a lord cheating ; of gentlemen
backing the lord because he was cheating Did he ever hear of young
men being rooked at play, and in good society too ! or are blacklegs
only to be found among the lower classes 1
It's too bad that all the regret is to be for the gentlefolks, and all the
abuse for the vulgar. Why not lament that the commoners fall into bad
company with lords, and are ruined by their wicked associates?
Besides, what is a gentleman? Does a gentleman who associates with
blackguards continue to be a gentleman, or degrade himself to be a black-
guard 1 or does a blackguard become a gentleman by consorting with such,
or how !—and what may a man do and still be a gentleman—let MR.
Justice JENkins decide.
If gentlemen consort with rogues and swindlers, knowing them per-
fectly to be such, have money transactions with them, win or lose by their
successful or unsuccessful roguery, it is too bad of a judge to assume that
the gentlemen are the spotless in honour, and the clodpoles the only
rascals. It is paying the gentlefolks a bad compliment too. What fools
they must be to go into such society; where, according to Judge Alder-
son, the poor artless creatures are sure of being plundered.
No | A gentleman who has an affection for the society of thieves,
depend upon it, frequents them for some other motive than that of hav-
ing his pockets picked. There's no pleasure in that. Our respected
superiors are not so “jolly green” as the judge describes them. ...Does
not Lord GeoRGE show in the transaction that he can pretty well take
care of himself?
They go among those knaves and swindlers, those low-bred ruffians
reeking of gin and the stable, to make money of them. They associate with
boors and grooms, Jew gambling-house keepers, boxers and bullies, for
money's sake to be sure. What other could bring such dandies into com-
munication with such brutes ? You can't suppose that a gentleman would
associate with such scoundrels, any more than he would willingly incur an
infection, unless he had some end in view.
And the noble patrons of the Turf have a great end in view—that of
money. So the Turf becomes our pride, and we respect it as a great
English Institution, of which we have just as good reason to be proud as
I have of the hump on my back.
But let young men coming out in life follow Punch's counsel as well as
BARon Alderson's. “Avoid the Turf blackguards,” says the BARon.
“My son,” I say to you, “avoid the Turf gentlemen too.”
Thrº UN Kindest CUT OF ALL.
MR. Roebuck has been abusing in Parliament the daily press. What,
in the name of pity, have we done that we were not included in the hon.
member's abuse !

PUNCH'S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER,
LETTER III.
FROM A GENTLEMAN TO A FRIEND, SOLICITING HIS ACCEPTANCE
AND BOND,
MY DEAR Richands,
In this our fleeting life, how few are the
opportunities afforded us of really testing the hearts
of our friends ! Sorry, indeed, should I be for my
own nature, were I of the barren creed of those
who, from the depths of their would-be wisdom, smile knowingly at
friendship, as though, like the word phoenix, it spoke of something
very fine, but very fabulous: a spicy monster, building in the clouds,
and never known to descend upon our earth. No : I should be
among the most insensible of my kind—a very savage of social life—
did I fail to worship friendship in my innermost heart as a virtue
illustrated by one of the noblest of created men. Forgive me if I do
not name him; for true worth, like the rose, will blush at its own
sweetness :
Truly, it is pleasant to hear men abuse the world, as though, for-
sooth, they themselves were the only shining exceptions from the
eneral selfishness they condemn. When I hear a man cry out, “It
is a bad world,” I must of course lump him with the aggregate ini-
quity; for how can he have the enormous vanity to select himself as
the one pure Adam from naughty millions ! No, Richands; be it
my faith to think the best of the world; be it my special felicity to
know that I hold the heart—ay, as though it were in my hand—of
the truest and the best of friends. But what, indeed, is friendship,
if it be not active What, but a harp, or the divinest of Cremonas,
resting in silence—all the melodious, ravishing sounds that waft our
spirits to the clouds, sleeping in their strings, a dumb sleep So is
it with the heart of a true friend until touched by the wants of his
companion.
My dear RIchands, I enclose you a bill for a hundred and fifty
pounds. That bill, like the harp or fiddle I have spoken of, is now as
a dead thing. But only write across it “Accepted, John Richards,”
and it will have a voice of gold—yes it will ring with sovereigns.
Oh, friendship ! thou divinest alchemist, that man should ever pro-
fane thee I Send the bill back by post, as I must have the cash
to-morrow.
I have many acquaintance, any of whom would have gone through
the little form (for it is only a form,) I ask of you. But no : I should
have thought such an act on my part a treason to our friendship.
You know, my dear boy, that I am apt to be imaginative; and thus,
it is a sweet and peculiar pleasure to me to fancy both our names
linked indissolubly together—the union legalised by a five-shilling
stamp, each adding value to the other by being paired. Thus, it
almost seems to me, that we merge two souls into one—that in very
truth, by the potent spell of friendship, we are no longer single, but
bound together by a bond unknown to those pagans of the ancient
time, OREstEs and PYLADEs, DAMon and Pythias |
Yes; with a slight flourish of the pen, we shall feel what I once
thought impossible, a greater interest in one another. We shall know
that our names, written upon accredited paper, pass in the world as
symbols of gold; you will have turned ink-drops into ready money,
tnd I shall have received it.
The roses that wreathe around the
stamp are, to my mind's eye, Richands, the very types of our
kindred minds. Do not, however, fail to post the bili to-night.
There is—I believe he calls it—a bond on my account for three
or four hundreds to which a troublesome attorney wants your name.
Come and breakfast with me on Monday, my dear boy, and it shall
be ready for you. Heaven bless you,
Your friend, to the Place of Tombs,
Mont Ague St. GEorge.
P.S.. I have a páté de foie gras, which I don't think you ever tasted,
from Paris, for Monday. It's made of geese's-liver. They put the live
goose before the fire and make it drink and drink. . Rather cruel,
but there's no mistake in the liver.
LETTER IV.
The FRIEND's ANswer, REFUSING BOTH ACCEPTANCE AND BOND.
MY DEAR Mont AGUE,
Youn letter has given me great pleasure. You know how
highly I have always thought of friendship; it is, as you say, a divine
thing. Indeed, to my mind so divine, that it should never, no never,
be mixed up with money.
Nevertheless, however we may differ on this little point, it is
impossible for me to speak as I feel on your letter. It is charmingly
written. There is a beauty, a fervour in your sentiments about
friendship that convince me you have felt its treasures, and are
therein, though poor in the world's esteem, rich as an Emperor. My
dear friend, cultivate this style of writing: I am certain Inoney is to
be made by it.
I agree with you as to your opinion of the world; it is a glorious
world—and glorious, indeed, are some of the people in it. The
friendship that has so long subsisted between us, must make me
acknowledge this. Your simile of a friend and a fiddle is perfect
and touching. What, indeed, are they both made for, if not to be
played upon
Your picture of the unison of souls, when both the souls' hands are
to the same bill, is beautiful, affecting. I have read the passage over
twenty times. It has neither one word too many or too few. The
picture is perfect: a cabinet gem to be locked up in one's heart.
The unison of souls is a charming phrase; but, unhappily, my friend,
it is too fine, of too subtle an essence to be acknowledged and res-
pected by the coarse men of the world. The sheriff, for instance,
cares not for souls, only inasmuch as they are in bodies. Now, unhap-
pily, so far as we know, disembodied souls do not draw or accept;
otherwise, what felicity would it be to me to meet and mingle with
your spirit on a five-shilling stamp !
I confess, too, that it is tempting to think that, by the alchemy of
a few ink-drops, I could put a hundred and fifty gold pieces (bating
the discount) in the purse of my friend. Alas ! if the ceremony
began and ended with ink, I would spend a Black Sea upon you.
You should have my name ten thousand times multiplied, with a good
wish in every stroke, hair and thick.
That you have eschewed so many acquaintance, all happy with
clean-nibbed pens to accept for you, and in the fulness of your friend-
ship selected me, is a compliment, may more, it is an evidence of
your affection which I—I hope to deserve.
You know that I, as well as yourself, am apt to be imaginative.
Imaginations, however, fly not always together. You say, that by
accepting the bill, our souls would be united. My dear friend, for
three months, I should feel ourselves growing together, every day
strengthening the process. I should feel as if I breathed for two ; nay,
I should hardly turn in my bed unincumbered. I should, in my
fancy, become a double man with only single strength to bear about
my added load. You know the story of Sinbad and the Old Man
of the Mountain That is a fine allegory, though not understood.
The truth is, the Old Man drew a bill, and Sinbad—guileless tar !—
accepted it.
- You speak of the roses that wreathe about the stamp. They are,
indeed, very pretty. But, somehow, my eye fell upon the thistles;
which I doubt not, the benevolence of Her Majesty causes to be
embossed there: thistles, clearly significant that the man who
accepts a bill, save for his own debt, is an ass.
I am, on the contrary,
Your affectionate friend,
John Richards

IRISH STATE TRIALS.
PRoceedings in ERRoR BEFore THE House of Lords.
Their Lordships met at 10 o'clock on Thursday morning, for the
purpose of hearing the arguments, in this case; and counsel having been
called in, a discussion arose as to the best means of saving time.
The Lord CHANCELLoR observed that they had only got four days, and
it would be desirable to make the most of them. If the case could not be
disposed of, the traversers must remain in prison.
LoRD BRough AM saw the .# of saving time. He remembered a
story told by a certain peer in their Lordships' House—a peer who might
not be in the recollection of all their Lordships, but some of their Lord-
ships might, perhaps, remember the circumstance.
Loap CAMPBell thought that if time was an object, his noble and ||
learned friend was taking a very strange mode of saving it.
LoRD BROUGHAM replied that he always saved time when he talked, but
the noble and learned Lord (CAMPBell) never spoke without wasting time.
The LoRD CHANCELLOR was anxious that some arrangement should, if
possible, be entered into to save time. . There were seven counsel who
might all claim to be heard for the seven traversers.
SIR Thomas Wilde said it would be impossible for him to shorten his
address. He had a duty to perform to his client, and that duty he would
discharge.
The Lord Chancellor. But suppose your client is kept in prison
because your speeches take so long a time that it becomes impossible to
give judgment until the term of the sentence has expired.
SIR Thomas Wilde repeated that his speech must be delivered. He
had a duty to perform.
LoRD BRough AM. What have you got to say, MR. Hill
MR. HILL. I shall want a clear day, at least, my Lords.
LoRD BRough AM. Surely, MR. Peacock, what you have to urge ought
not to occupy many minutes.
MR. Peacock observed that he should require an entire morning.
A counsel, whose name we could not learn, here rose, and said he
should like a week. The rest of the learned gentleman's speech was
drowned in a general shout of “Oh 1” and he was pulled down furiously
by MR. FitzRoy Kelly and MR. SERGEANT MURphy.
LoRD BRough AM. You will be entitled to a reply.
what do you mean to do
SIR. W. Follert. I shall certainly claim the reply.
MR. FitzRoy Kelly said he should expect to be heard in reply.
LoRD BRough AM. Then we shall have seven replies, unless we save one
in the person of MR. Peacock.
MR. Peacock said he should wish to reply.
The Lord CHANCELLOR. What do you mean to do, MR. Hill
MR. M. D. Hill...All I can, my Lord. (A laugh.) If the other
counsel reply, I shall certainly reply also.
The learned counsel, whose name we could not learn, intimated that he
should expect to be heard in rejoinder as well as in reply.
LoRD BRough AM. Good gracious, man, what are you thinking about !
The learned counsel observed, he had a right to speak in mitigation.
LoRD BRough AM. You are now speaking in aggravation.
SERGEANT MURPHY here muffled the mouth of the learned counsel
with his brief-bag ; and
SiR THoMAs Wilde commenced his address, for which we refer to the
papers of the day, showing the numerous interruptions and episodes it
was interspersed with.
Mr. Attorney,
A POST OFFICE PIE.
The Stanford Mercury states that a day or two since a gooseberry pio
was sent through the Post-office. For the sake of those who ate it, we
hope that Sir JAMEs had no finger in it, the Home Secretary having, just
now, not the cleanest of hands.

We have heard that MR. CHARLEs Dickens is about to apply to the
Court of Chancery for an injunction to prevent SIR Robert PEEL conti-
nuing any longer to personate, in his capacity of Premier, the character
of MR.PEcksNiff, as delineated in Martin Chuzzlewit, that character being
copyright. We hope this rumour is unfounded, as the injunction would
certainly be refused. SIR Robert PEEL is in a condition to prove that
the part in question has been enacted by him for a long series of years,
and was so, long before any of MR. Dickens's works appeared ; in short,
that he, SIR Robert PEEL, is the original PecksNiff.
“AN ENGLISHMAN'S HOUSE IS HIS CASTLE.”
The truth of this soul-delighting saw was beautifully illustrated, two
or three days ago, in a court off Gulston Street, Whitechapel. A poor
man, named LEEson, owed ls. 6d. for rent; yes, he was one week in
arrear, having before been punctual with his eighteenpence. His land-
lord, named MARTIN–may seraphs harp the syllables 1–forced the room-
door off the hinges—dragged a girl of fifteen by the hair of her head from
the bed, then her brother, a boy of seven—and, lastly, removed an infant,
which he placed on the ground outside the door . The poor girl had
prepared some food for the babe, which the merciful MARTIN, in the
fullness of his powers of distraint, refused to let her have. One Lyons,
a Jew broker, dwelling at 4, George Court, Stoney Lane (an apt address),
Houndsditch, then left the following document, which was handed in to
MR. Norton, of Lambeth Street:—“Rent, 3s. ; levy, 3s.; and man in
possession, 2s. 6d., making altogether 8s. 6d., though all that was due was
one week's rent, 1s. 6d.” What a luxurious thing is English law, even
when it visits the hovels of the poor . For eighteenpence debt, law asks
seven shillings costs MR. Norton, however, sent word to the land-
lord and the Jew that they must immediately restore the goods free of .
expense. He had better have sent his warrant for their apprehension
for the assault, and punished them accordingly. However, Leeson may,
as a Briton, have this satisfaction : his house is his castle, so long as his
landlord and a Jew broker refrain from breaking into it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S FINE ART EXHIBITION.
Ew persons will deny that the subjects of this Exhi-
bition, of which we give unrivalled copies to
the British public this day, are disgraceful
in every point of view : that they are mean
in execution : that they are vulgar in idea:
that they are questionable in morality:
and, in a word, unworthy of consideration.
We therefore propose to examine them
calmly, carefully, and in an aesthetical point
of view. As we have no party prejudices,
we are happy to say that we despise them
all equally; and have spared no expense to
lay them before a generous and enlightened
public, for whose opinions we do not care
one Straw.
Why MR. Spoken should have repre-
sented our Gracious Queen in the character
of “BRITANNIA patronizing the Fine
Arts,” we are at a loss to conceive. It is
neither correct in point of history, nor complimentary to our Gracious
Monarch, who does not patronize the British Fine Arts at all, liking,
and with reason, French, German, and Italian artists, much better.
Nor is GENERAL Tom Thumb a Briton. He was, like GENERAL
WashingtoN, born in the town of Kentucky, in the county of
Pennsylvania, U.S., and, therefore, is an American. Hence it is
absurd to typify him as an exemplification of the Fine Arts.
That the Artists of Great Britain are among the most devoted of
Her Majesty's subjects, is proved from the fact that they furnish the
Queen with pictures at about a fifth part of the price which common
publishers will give for them. So that it is lucky for them that the
Sovereign does not patronize the Fine Arts more. This is no doubt
the royal reason, and is incontrovertible : only vulgar persons will,
henceforth, raise any objection to Her Majesty's apparent coldness
towards the Arts.
The other large piece by Spilleh is equally reprehensible—
* Field Marshal his Royal Highness Prince ALBERT attiring MARs
for battle.” Mars was the God of war—he is so no longer. He is
represented with the flower-pot-Albert hat which he never wore :
and which is about as fit for a God of war as a gauze turban with a
bird of paradise or a tulip to ornament it.
His Royal Highness the Prince Field Marshal nerer put this hat on
MARs—on the contrary, he withdrew it. It is, therefore, disrespect-
ful to the Prince, as it is disgraceful to the God of war.
MARs is represented with a Blucher lying beside him. Ought he
not in common justice and good feeling to have had a Wellington on
the other foot 1
No. 965. “Joseph Hume buttoning his caliga, or highlow.” Of
this statue we make the complaint that has been made relative to the
effigies of his Grace the Duke of WELLINGTGN, his late most sacred
Majesty GEoRGE IV., &c.—viz., a total, shameful, wicked, mean,
perverse, base inaccuracy of costume. How is Joseph represented
by a wicked perversion of fact—in pantaloons—and nothing but pan-
taloons. Is he not a Scotchman—and do Scotchmen wear panta-
loons —quite the contrary. There is not a snuff establishment in the
metropolis but can furnish a proud denial to the question. So much
for the author of Huxſe;—pass we now to
1885. “B. D'Israeli, Esquire, (M.P.), strangling the Whig and
Tory serpents.” This is a fine idea—and the snakes we may say are
magnificently handled. Whether, however, the Tories are snakes, or
the Whigs resemble those exceedingly venomous creatures—we for
our parts decline to state. To call a gent. a snake, is to our thinking,
to say that he is no better than a reptile : and is it fair to treat the
two great parties in England in this humiliating manner }
The portrait of the celebrated author of “Coningsmark,” &c., is
good, but not in the least like him. In this the artist has shown his
tact and skill.
10465. “Mercury teaching Sin JAMEs GRAHAM the Use of
Lett-ºrs.” Absurd—contrary to truth. It was CADMUs who invented
letters by the aid of the God of Quicksilver. SIR JAMEs Graham
only broke them open when written.
100000. “John Bull extracting the Income-Tax from his Foot.”
Ha! haſ haſ We wish he may procure it, but not all the Levis
or Eisr NBERGs in the world can remove that obstruction from him.
As for “Sibthorp eating Thistles” (895), and “Loºp Bhough AM
in the character of a Peri mourning his being kicked out of
Paradise” (No. 4967), these are base-reliefs indeed;—if Colonel S.
likes thistles (and we have not heard whether he does or no, and
if he does, there are some very useful animals who like them, too),
why should he not eat them and why be held up to public ridicule
for a harmless, though singular, taste § And in regard of Lond
Brough AM being turned out of the Treasury—we ask one thing
—Could his Lordship help it 1 and is it not perfectly natural that
he would like to get back again? Would not Russell and PALMER-
stos like to go back, too ! and, as in the case of John Bull
(100000), we say, we heartily wish they may get it.
THE * EIGHT POUND" GOVERNESS.
In a recent number, it may be remembered, we extracted an advertise-
ment for “A Governess of Decided Piety,” at eight pounds per annum.
The letters were to be addressed to “MR. BRUCE, Stationer, Trump-street,
King-street, Cheapside,”—the unsuspecting MR. Bruce never having seen
the advertisement which was to shed its mild rays on the Evangelical
Magazine. Hence, many persons have—in their contempt of “G. I.”
the advertiser—confounded him in some way with the worthy MR. BRUCE,
who, had he seen the advertisement, would, he assures us, have never lent
his name and house to so shabby a transaction. We have also been
informed that “ G. I.”—(by the way, is “G. I.” either of the dozen
Wandering Jews?)—has obtained a victim, a governess; that, in his own
words, “he is nicely suited.” Poor doomed thing !
PUNCH's (Exclusive) LAW REPORT.
THE important question, which of the Barons should try the case
of Running Rein, was discussed in their lordships' private room.
Instead of the sittings in banco, their Lordships held their
SITTINGS IN ELBOW-CHAIRS BEFORE MAHOGANY.
Mr. BARon ALDERson opened the proceedings by remarking that
there would be some fun for the judge who tried the case of Run-
ning Rein. And he thought it would not be fair for the chief to
exercise his privilege, and preside as he would in strictness have
the right to do.
MR. BARoN Rolf E said the question was really one of merits, and
the judge in whose peculiar line the matter seemed to be, ought, he
(MR. B.Anon RolfE) thought, to be the one to try it.
The Chief Baron said he would be glad to leave the affair in the
hands of the puisnes.
MR. B.Anon GURNEY said the only point to decide was whether
the trial was likely to be comic or serious. If comic, he thought the
broad humour of his brother ALDERson would meet the merits, but
if serious, he thought that the melodramatic and impressive Baron on
his left (he meant Ma. BARoN PARKE), would be the judge to whose
hands the matter ought to be committed.
MR. BARon PARKE observed that if he were selected to try the
case, he should adopt the solemn tone of the Admiral in Black-Eyed
Susan, whose luminous judgment on William seemed to be a model of
British jurisprudence.
After some further consultation, it was agreed that their Lordships
should toss up, or, in other words, undergo the ancient ordeal of trial
by copper. This plan, however, presented difficulties, and it was
then proposed to settle the question in the shape of a game at odd
man, but this left it still unsatisfactory, for two of the very oddest
men are Barons of the Exchequer.
It was ultimately settled that BAmon ALDERson should try the
case that had been the subject of so much judicial competition.

GRAHAMPS “SECRET COMMITTEE.”
HE magnanimous determina-
tion of SIR JAMEs GRAHAM
to explain all his letter-break-
ing doings — the inevitable
felonies of ungrateful office
—has ended in an amendment
for the appointment of a Se-
cret Committee 1 SIR JAMEs
was desirous that the fullest
light should be thrown upon
the business; but then the
light must be in a dark lan-
tern. He was painfully anx-
ious that the whole universe
should know every circum-
stance—nevertheless,it would
be best to confine such know-
ledge to some half-dozen in-
dividuals. In one evening
did SIR JAMEs double the
parts of Brother Bruin and
Jerry Sneak.
However, the Committee have been at work; meeting and trans-
acting their business with a secrecy and stillness touchingly compli-
mentary to SIR JAMEs. The Committee-room (No. 14) was especially
prepared for the occasion. The windows were hung with curtains
which admitted a very dim, though not particularly religious light.
We observed—(how Punch obtained admittance, it would be very
ungrateful in him towards Sin JAMEs to declare)—we observed a
tea-kettle and hammer hanging from the walls, the insignia of the
Post-office under the direction of the present Home Secretary.
It is now, we believe, pretty generally known that the steaming
kettle is employed to undo wafers—whilst the hammer transmits
the impression of the wax to a piece of lead which, the letter being
perused by SIR JAMEs, is used to re-seal the missive, that unsuspected
it may pass into the hands of its guileless owner.
The members of the Committee are only admitted into the room
by a pass and countersign. Thus, an officer appointed for the pur-
pose cries “Fouché,” and the member answers “Jack Sheppard: ”
on this the member—who, by the way, we should observe, is care-
fully masked, in order that the witnesses examined may not know
their interrogators—enters, and takes his place.
It is, in truth, a great pang to us that our limited weekly sheet
does not afford verge and room enough to give a cerbatim report of all
the proceedings. We trust, however, to be able to give sufficient to
display the fine spirit animating the Committee. The first witness
called and examined was
SIR JAMES GRAHAM, BART.
You are the Secretary for the Home Department, SIR JAMEs –
I have that good fortune, whatever the country may think to the
contrary.
And, as Secretary, you have the run of the Post Office —Such
privilege is one of the peculiar sweets of my office.
You have been in correspondence with several foreign powers ?–
I have.
For the purpose of opening letters addressed to their various
subjects?—Exactly. I consider myself a sort of foolscap Jack
Sheppard to all crowned heads.
Do you conceive such custom congenial to the habits of English-
men —Perhaps not yet ; but use—'tis a worn adage—is second
mature. In time, I have no doubt that letters may be opened quietly
as oysters.
Is it not an axiom that every Englishman's house is his castle —
Why, there is an agreeable fiction of the kind. There is, too, a poet-
ical illusion that to break wax or wafers is to commit a felony. These
things are the imaginative parts of the laws of England—or, I should
| rather say the jokes, invented to relieve the general dullness of the
statutes.
You do not object to break open a man's letter? You would,
consequently, not refuse to break open his desk —Most certainly I
should, and for this reason. The letter may be resealed, and so
‘. notice: now the broken desk would at once betray the
W10lence,
-
But how if you could open it with a false key t—That materially
alters the question.
Do you see any difference between a counterfeit seal and a false
key –None whatever. Both instruments are excellent in their
way; and particularly serviceable to a “strong government.”
Have you any objection to state what letters you have opened, and
to whom addressed —No objection whatever. Here are copies of a
few to and from General ToM THUMB, the Ojibbeway Indians,
Mlle. DEJAzer, Mons. Jullien, MR. EisenBER6, the corn-cutter;
HERR DöBLER, SIGNon BERTolin1, the eating-house keeper; Mons.
VEREY, the partry-cook; besides others.
All of them foreigners?—All. I had them stopped in obedience
to the commands of their separate governments.
May the Committee ask you the favour to go over them t Your long
practice must have rendered you so excellent a reader t—Truly, gen.
tlemen, I never boast, never; but if there is anything I can do, it is
reading other people's letters.
Proceed, SIR JAMEs.
Here the worthy and respected Baronet proceeded to read an
epistle from ToM THUMB to a brother in America:—
“My dear Jonathan,—We are gettin' on slick as greased lightnin':
doin’ it tarnation strong to be sure. As for the smartest nation of crea.
tion, I have now considerable doubts since I’ve been among the Britishers.
President TYLER is no rowdy at all after Queen Wic. : he never gave me
the slightest thing on airth—but the Queen has done the right thing in
the way of millions of jewellery. Governor BARNuM is as gay as an alli-
gator in a pond of treacle. . As for me, I'm beautiful, and don't grow at
all, the gin here being so splendiferous. I’ve got watches from the royal
family for all of you.
“Your affectionate Brother,
“ToM THUMB, General.
“P. S. I don't sing Yankee Doodle now ; but tip the Britishers God
Save the Queen. Nothing like soft sawder here, I can tell you.”
Here SIR JAMEs GRAHAM was re-examined.
What led you to intercept General ToM THUMB's letters 1—In-
structions from President TYLER. You will perceive that the
PRESIDENT is spoken of in a contemptuous manner as being “no
rowdy” at all. Now, if we are to allow Tom Thumb the hospitality
of the Egyptian Hall, we are not to permit him to sneer at the head
of a country, with which we are at profound peace. Besides, the
PREsident informed me that Tom Thumb was concocting a con-
spiracy with other Americans in London, the purpose of which was
to destroy Pennsylvanian bonds, by buying them up. This the
PREsin Ent considered an unexpected blow at the credit of his
country.
The next Letter which we have room for was from Mr. Eisen-
BERG :-
“My dear KARI,_To shew you how I am getting on in this country, I
inclose you the following certificate from SIR. Robert PEEL :—
“‘Mr. EisenBERG has entirely relieved me from my corn that has
troubled me all the session. I think him a far superior operator to
BRight or Cobden.”
“When I return, my dear KARL, you shall see how I'll cut the corns
of Old Germany.”
Sin JAMEs GRAHAM re-examined.
Well, Sir James, Mr. Eisenberg's letter is harmless enough t—
Certainly not: it is plain that, by his allusion to cutting the corns of
Old Germany, he means to advance the progress, the movement as it
is called, of that country. The King of PRussia is dreadfully
troubled with corns; so much so, he can make no advance at ali.
This secret he confided to me as Home Secretary, and I considered
it a solemn duty to that potentate to open all letters to and from
MR. EisenBERG. If we welcome foreigners to our hearth-stones, it
is not that they should whet their revolutionary weapons upon them.
The next letter was from Mlle. DEJAzer. SIB JAMEs very
fluently translated it:-
“My dear ANGELIQUE,--I have quite enchanted the barbarous Islanders.
Pauvres bêtest They have almost smothered me with bouquets. Never-
theless, I have not forgotten La Belle France, as Louis Philippe shall
find the very next time I am commanded to Versailles.
“You know these English are only fit to make knives and scissors. I
have purchased—but I won't tell you what till we meet.”
SIR JAMEs GRAHAM re-examined.
And was MLLE. DEJAzET considered dangerous 1 Certainly. I
was desired by Louis PHILIPPE to keep my eye upon her: all her
letters were of course brought to me: but I hope I have exercised a
very proper delicacy. The police traced her “purchase” to the

--N- -
tradesman. We feared, from the dark way in which she hints
at Louis PHILIPPE, another infernal machine.
And what article did the lady buy?—A steel corkscrew of the last
atent.
p Here SIR JAMEs read other letters, but we have no room for the
contents. He, however, declared that there was danger to our
Canadian frontier in the epistles of the Ojibbeways—that M. JULLIEN
was likely to set England by the ears—that HERR DöBLER, by his
adroit and successful shuffling, naturally excited envy in all the
breasts of Downing Street—and that Bentolin1 and VEREY, in
their separate letters, gave great uneasiness to foreign nations, as
they proved that Young Germany, Young Switzerland, Young
Poland, Young Italy, and Young France, were continually meeting
at both the tradesmen's houses, and of late consuming dinners and
drinking wines of a very superior quality. It was plain, argued SIR
JAMEs, that revolutionary gold was spreading ; and, therefore, it
was his solemn duty to open every letter that came into his clutches.
Perhaps we may continue to report the proceedings of the
Secret Committee.
DEAR SHAKSPEARE.
or Seven weeks
ago, MRs. WAR-
NER and MR.
PhELPs took
Sadler's Wells
Theatre, therein
---, to enact, with
is some chance of
25° success,the plays
of W.M. Shak-
Punch
presents his compliments to MRs. WARNER and MR. Phelps, and there-
with his congratulations, for the zeal which has impelled them thus to
consecrate a temple to the Drama in the remote waste of Islington.
He begs at the same time to tell them, that he knows a trick worth con-
siderably more than two of theirs.
They have made ShakspeaRE cheap to the people. Now, if they have
any regard for their interests, and, he need not say, for propriety, they
should endeavour to make him dear to the people.
By rendering ShakspeaRe dear to the people, they will convert him
into a luxury; and thus, placing him in the category of early peas, unsea-
sonable strawberries, extraordinary fiddlers, and horticultural shows,
procure for him the patronage of the exclusive circles.
MR. Charles KEMBLE has been reading ShakspeaRE to crowded
audiences, composed of the élite of Ton, at the charge of 10s. 6d. a head
for admission. The same MR. CHARLEs KEMBLE has played the same
ShakspeaRE at Covent Garden to nearly empty benches. It was long
thought that the fashionable world would not have ShakspeaRE at any
price ; but the fact is, that they will have him at a certain price; only it
must not be under 10s. 6d.
It is not true that our aristocracy do not care about the Bard of Avon.
On the contrary, they are so fond of him that they must have him all to
themselves. They understand him quite as well as they do music which
is intrinsically nonsensical, and would at least give as much to hear
him as to see a dancing-girl caper. Besides, during the performance of
Macbeth or Othello, they could talk and chat with each other, just as com-
fortably as they do at the Opera.
This word Opera is Punch's cue. He seriously advises Mrs. WARNER
and MR. Phelps to take her Majesty's Theatre on the off-nights; and to
charge opera prices for admission. The ladies will all rush to hear dear
ShakspeaRE; and, of course, the gentlemen will follow them. If this hint
is not taken by those to whom it is addressed, Punch does not know that he
will not act upon it himself ; and if it does not answer—if the house is not
nightly crowded by Rank, Fashion, and Beauty, to his realisation of a
fortune by the end of the season—he does not say that he will not shut up
his Office.
HER MAJESTY AND THE MILLINERS.
It is with great pleasure that we copy the following from the daily
papers :-
“The Queen has been pleased to send a donation of 50l. to the Association for the Aid
and Benefit of Dressmakers and Milliners.”
There was a foolish, nay, a wicked rumour that her Majesty had all her
dresses, direct from Paris—that they were duly taken to Buckingham
Palace in charge of an officer of the customs; but the paragraph we have
quoted, pregnant as it is with sympathy for English workwomen, gives a
triumphant denial to the calumny.
A CASE OF REAL DISTRESS.
THE father of a numerous family
is compelled to throw himself
on the generosity of a British public.
He is a Frenchman and has tried
his own nation in vain. He there-
fore comes like Themistocles to
place himself at the threshold of
his most generous and powerful
enemies.
His name is Louis Philip—he was
recognised by BENJAMIN D'IsrAELI
Esquire, as Ulysses—he refers to that
gentleman and Lohn Brough AM,
who both knew him in better days.
He is not only a father but a
grandfather; and the poor little
ones round about him are crying for
bread. It is awful how great their
appetites are, and his paternal old
bowels yearn with pity at the no-
tion of their want.
He has a sister who is very kind
to the children, and has come down
with the dust as far as her humble means permitted.—His cousin
CHARLEs Dix by name, left him a pair of shoes, which he has worn
ever since 1830; another cousin, one ANTony Condé, died and left
one of his sons a decent maintenance. But there are a dozen left—
quite unprovided for—the unhappy father could not pay the money
he promised to Léopold BELLEchique, who married his eldest
daughter, and who has been dunning him ever since.
The world presents no instance perhaps of a parallel misery.
And as his own people refuse to help him; and as the English
are proverbial for their generosity towards Jews, Ashantees, Quashi-
maboos, &c.—L. PHILIP humbly suggests that his own case be con-
sidered, and beseeches them to come down with the stumpy.
The smallest subscriptions in money or goods thankfully received;
among which we have the gratification of announcing—
DANIEL O'Connell, Esq. . - - - - - . 0}
LoRD BRough AM . a pair of Shepherd's plaid inexpressibles.
BENJAMIN S1Donia, Esq. - - - - . 2 old hats.
— PEcksNIFF, Esq., a warm and uncompromising
admirer of virtue—a friend to distress—a lover of
respectability—and a humble helper of all in need, A toothpick.
Need we say that our Offices are open for the generous purpose of
the subscription ?
MOORISH DESIGNS.
(From the National.)
The EMPERoR of MoRocco is raising troops in Europe. Already the
Brussels journals announce that several scores of Braves Belges have
been enlisted, and are on their way to Abdel-Rahman.
We need not French soldiers to destroy these paltry mercenaries. Let
the Government hire half the number of Dutchmen.
But there is a nation of much greater importance, which is busy in the
field against us—a nation always perfidious and ready to wreak against
France its diabolical ill-will. We need not say we allude to England. A
well-informed Correspondent from London writes—
“War will be declared nert month.”
I have this intelligence from the most positive authority. All the gun.
makers of London are busy preparing arms; immense provisions of lead
and powder are making daily. I myself went with SiR Bouledog (a
young, Baronet and Member of the Upper House), to inspect a store of
weapons, of which he selected two formidable instruments, and when I
asked for what purpose, he replied with insolent calmness:—“My good
friend S. and a party are off to the Moors.”
The day is fixed for the 12th of August, half the young aristocrats of
England have given themselves rendezvous in Morocco; and this is our
ally, this is the entente cordiale, this is England in a word.
We summon the Minister; we adjure the insulted nation; we recal the
wrongs of eight centuries of hatred ; we demand, is this news true
The Strongest Corroboration.
In consequence of the alterations caused by Sir R. PEEL's new law, it
is reported that ninety additional clerks have been engaged at the Bank.
This report must be true, as we have been told ninety additional newspa-
pers have been ordered to be sent in every morning to the same place.

THE QUEEN'S VISIT
TO THE “ PUNCH* FINE ART EXHIBITION.
ER MAJESTY and PRINCE ALBERT, previous
to this splendid collection being thrown
open to the public in the pages of Punch,
were invited to a private view, at the
extensive studio in Whitefriars.
At an early hour, MR. Jones (not the
GEORGE,) was in attendance to receive the
royal guests; but, it was pithily observed,
that the more he kept on waiting, the more
did the royal couple seem disposed to keep
on not coming. At about twelve o'clock,
a rattling of carriage-wheels in Bouverie-
street announced the arrival of the royal
cortège, consisting of a single carriage;
which, by a good deal of ingenious backing
and manoeuvring, was successfully jammed
up into the corner of Lombard-street, pre-
cisely opposite the principal entrance to
the studio of the establishment. Lombard-street (Whitefriars)—our
Lombard-street—presented a scene of extraordinary commotion. The
white banner of Marseilles—belonging to the order of the washed quilt
—floated from the second-floor window of the laundress at No. 5; while
mignonette gushed from a broken tea-pot at the attic of No. 2; and a
sweet-pea, at No. 6, was twining itself fervently round a piece of string
with all that clinging ardour of attachment which none but lovers and
scarlet-beans are in the habit of exhibiting.
The fowls in the romantic little street of the adventurous Lombards,
had clustered beneath a truck full of stereotype plates, which was standing
near, and a cloud having given way with a most creditable feeling of
courtesy, the sun was enabled to lend the scene its animating countenance.
MR. SMITH was immediately at the door of the royal carriage, and with
considerable presence of mind began to whistle the National Anthem, as
he led the way to the studio—the road to greatness is always difficult to
mount, which accounts for the fact that Punch's studio is only approach-
able by a perpendicular flight of steps, which the courteous would call a
staircase, but to which stern unflinching truth could only affix the name
of ladder. Perhaps, good-nature might take a middle course, and use the
milder term of “flight of steps,” though nothing but delicacy prevents us
from denouncing the means of ascent as a ladder, assuming the arrogant
aspect of a genuine staircase.
MRSMITH walked with considerable dignity up the steps, followed by
the royal couple, who, on arriving at the top, were conducted into the
cutting-room. Here PRINCE ALBERT looked round him with evident delight,
and observing a box on the chimney-piece, inquired its use. On being
told it was for contributions, he liberally dropped two jokes into it;
which, on his Royal Highness's departure, were taken out, and distributed
among the boys engaged on the establishment.
At a signal from MR, SMITH, the door of the studio itself was suddenly
thrown open, and MR. Jones was discovered, attended by two devils-in-
ordinary, who formed in single line, and preceded the royal visitors in
the direction of the fire-place. HER MAJESTY and the PRINCE then
examined very minutely the collection of cartoons and statues which are
given in the present number of Punch. The figure of “ Hume tying his
Highlow,” was objected to by the QUEEN, on the ground that the expres-
sion of the highlow was tame, and wanted sole, though HER MAJESTY
admired the idea of HUME being exhibited in the very act of putting his
foot in it.
A property déjeiner, of which it was known the royal visitors would
not partake, had been borrowed from one of the theatres, and the royal
couple, having expressed their wish to retire, MR. Jones conducted them
to the carriage, of which MR. SMITH opened the door, and the ceremony
of backing, plunging, rearing, capering, cracking of the whip, &c., having
}. again gone through, HER MAJESTY and the PRINCE returned to the
alace.
HUNGERFORD AND HER BRIDGES.
The works at the Hungerford Suspension Bridge are proceeding at
their usual pace, and we are told that “on Friday wooden cradles were
placed at each of the pillars in the centre of the river, for the men to
work in.” Nothing could be more appropriate than these cradles, which
have been thought necessary in consequence of the men engaged in the
work having been for some time past going to sleep over it. The directors
of the Company, however, declare that the cradles have been resorted to
because the concern is at present only in its infancy. We can only
attribute the reluctant amorous delay, evinced by the Proprietors in
putting up their chains, to an inclination to have their “linked sweet-
ness long drawn out.”
ITALIAN INTELLIGENCE! !
PUNCH OFFICE, HALF-PAST WINE.
TAKING OF VENICE i ! I
We have received a telegraphic despatch from our own correspondent,
announcing the taking of Venice—by a sheriff's officer. The distress
under which this model of a city has fallen is a distress for rent, and the
individual who acted as its Doge has calmly surrendered the republic into
the hands of the sheriff of Middlesex. The circumstance has suggested
the following poetical fragment:—
O Venice, Queen of cities—freedom's home !
Fair subject of the poet's noblest song 1
Who wert but second to immortal Rome,
Venice whose Doges in a goodly throng
Would fill a page of history six yards long,
Has all thy glory vanished in a day,
Has poverty for thee, then, beat its gong
Isle of the free, the beautiful, the gay,
Hast thou been seized for rent, thy masters could not pay?
I stood in Venice—at the Egyptian Hall,
A lamp shop and a stationer's on each hand,
I saw alarm its owner's heart appal,
As a rude bailiff—one of Levy's band—
The rent of the apartment did demand.
I marked the owner's very vacant stare,
And still more vacant purse—that model grand,
I heard the bailiff say, he might not spare.
Taking his warrant out, he read his duty there.
(Two hours later from Piccadilly.)
We are glad to find that the principal singers of Her Majesty's Theatre
have volunteered their services for a concert to be devoted to redeeming
Venice if possible from the grasp of its captors. If music once moved
the rocks, it may touch the hearts of the bailiffs. We shall be delighted
to hear that Venice, the city of pasteboard palaces, is once more free.
EQUESTRIAN FEAT OF THE PRINCE OF WALES.
Ast Friday and Saturday the “Court Circular” must
have given to British enthusiasm one of those
tremendous stirs which British enthusiasm,
bounding and bubbling about in British bosoms,
can alone experience. For several months the
public have been accustomed to hear that
“the Royal Family had taken their usual
airings,” and the announcement has no doubt
raised up before every loyal eye a pleasing
picture of Royal cherubim shuffling along the
ground on their precious little tootens, sup-
ported by the hands of nurses. But who could
have been prepared for the startling, nay, the
stunning, but withal, the gratifying, intelligence
that the PRINCE of Wales “rode out on a
pony.” “The stability of the Throne,” says
Jones, “depends on the certainty of the suc-
cession”—and when we find the heir-apparent
firmly seated on a pony, we must feel that the House of Brunswick
becomes more firmly seated in the affections of the people. Our heart
canters, our blood gallops through our veins, and our patriotism rears
proudly up, when we think we have got a Prince of Wales who ls
iearning to hold the reins of power by an early experience in holding the
bridle. -
We understand that his Royal Highness went round the small lawn at
the back of the kitchen-garden, at the rate of three miles an hºur, held
on only by two attendants, and that this “rapid act of ponymanship” gave
the highest satisfaction to the select party who were invited to witness the
Prince’s “Scenes in the Circle.” It was said that nothing had been wit-
nessed at Astley's in the same style that could come near to the equestrian
exhibition of the little Prince, whose “daring flight over a buttercup.”
would make a line in one of Astley's bills, that even Ma. Srickney would
find it difficult to carry out to the full satisfaction of an audience.
Foreign Intelligence.
We have received, by Extraordinary Express, despatches from Spain.
They contain nothing new—excepting that there has been no change of
Ministry during the present month. This is the more astonishing, as two
weeks have already elapsed.
Should such an event occur before 12 o'clock, we will certainly publish
a Second Edition. -

St. Martin's-le-Grand, July 19th.
FM perons, Kings, Princes, Grand Dukes, Viceroys, Popes, Poten-
tates, Infants, Regents, Barons, and Foreign Noblemen in general,
are respectfully announced that, on and after the present month, the
following alterations will take place in the opening of letters:—

Copies of letters opened will be despatched the same evening, and
every information afforded as to the address of suspected parties.
A Polish and Italian translator is now permanently engaged, and
a choice assortment of foreign seals has lately been added to the
extensive collection.
Greater dexterity practised since the recent disclosures.
*** No increase in the prices.
Extensive Imperial Failure.
Considerable sensation has been created in Imperial and Royal circles
by the alleged insolvency of PRINCE Jerome Bonaparte. The Prince
has, it appears, made a target of a certain luminary, or in other words,
“shot the moon,” by precipitately leaving, Florence. The Ex-king of
Westphalia was never confined to Ham—or its fortress.
The GENERAL ADVERTISER.
Lond BRough AM has been appointed in the House of Lords one of the
Committee for inquiring into the opening of letters. Since the Committee
is a secret one, his loquacious Lordship has of course been appointed to
officiate on all divisions in the capacity of a Teller.
REVIEWERS REVIEWED.
The QUARTERLY REview.—Murray.
One of the most elaborate articles in the present number of this pleasant
little miscellany is on the subject of illustrated books, in which an im-
mense fund of information is exhibited. In speaking of Punch, the writer
learnedly remarks, that it owes at least half its popularity to the pencil of
George Cruikshank—whose power of imparting popularity to any work
we do not for a moment doubt—though we hardly see how he has increased
the reputation of Punch, to which, as it so happens, he has never contri-
buted a single effort of his genius. We might as well say that our con-
temporary, the Quarterly, owes more than half its popularity to Boghos
Bey, or Dr. Praetorius.
Considering the variety of subjects the Quarterly touches upon, from
Toys to Timbuctoo, and from Punch to the Punjaub, it must be difficult
to collect the necessary facts, so that much must be left to the imagination
of the writer. The Quarterly reviewer has written about Punch without
knowing anything of the matter, as the gross blunder he has made will
testify. To show that we are not ill-natured, we promise that when we
again criticise the Quarterly, we will actually read it first ; and this would
be indeed making a sacrifice at the shrine of impartiality.
THE POST-OFFICE BALL.
The Waverley Ball in aid of the funds for the completion of Scott's
Monument having succeeded so well, it has been resolved to get up a
grand Post-office Dress Ball for the purpose of erecting a Statue to Sur
JAMEs GRAHAM, in commemoration of his “opening” virtues, so recently
discovered. We are enabled to give a few of the character-quadrilles,
with the distinguished names of the parties who have kindly consented to
preside over them.
The Jack Sheppard Quadrille .
The Paul Pry Quadrille -
The Peeping Tom Quadrille .
The Devil to Pay Quadrille . . Thomas Duncombs, Esq.
The Hypocrite Quadrille. . . The Editor of the Standard.
Other Quadrilles are in agitation ; and there is no doubt that sufficient
money will be returned to pay the expense of the Graham Statue, the
more especially as it is intended to cast it of the very finest black sealing.

THE BOY JONES AND THE BOY JOIN WILLE.
The eyes of Europe are once more upon the Boy Jones. Well,
the eyes of Europe have very often been turned upon more insig-
nificant persons. We confess it—we have a regard for the Boy
Jones. Whether he be really nephew or not of GEoRGE Jon Es,
of Ancient America, Esq., - we have nevertheless a regard for
the youth, who at so early an age associated his name with the
annals of his country; for what future History of England, we ask,
will be complete omitting all notice of Jones
Poor boy If fortune were not as perverse as a prima donna, the
Boy Jones would have been born in some western square; would
have learned his humanities at College, and so been regularly trained
for public place. Only think of the Boy Jones, as Home Secretary,
at the Post Office . As it is, we have only the heavy GRAHAM. At
least, we should have had sprightliness casting its charm over illega-
lities; Jones would have broken a seal with a whim apologetic of
the felony, whilst GRAHAM—but we will not pursue the contrast.
Jones is a genius. That of the millions who gaze upon the awful
walls of Buckingham Palace, shut out from them as from Paradise,
Jones should have been the only daring spirit that conceived a
design to pass them—to dip his plebeian fingers in the custards of
the royal larder—to creep up the royal chimneys—to crouch beneath
the royal sofa, thereby (as his uncle, GEong E Jones, has written to
Punch,) “causing her Majesty so much alarm;”—that he alone should
have done this makes Jones—whatever his real time of life may be
—far in advance of his age. And her Majesty—bless her —saw
the daring in its proper light; and therefore, as it now appears, sent
the Boy Jon Es on board the Warspite (whence the world has just
heard of him,) with a recommendation to the Captain to watch “his
dawning merits,” that Jones may, in good time, sport epaulets.
A recent letter tells us that Jon Es fell overboard off Tunis in the
first-watch ; when the life-buoy, “which blazed away with a steady
and beautiful light,” was let go, and Jones clinging to it, called out
to the boat's-crew, “here I am—look lively 1” However, the writer
insinuates that Jon Es jumped overboard, “and that for no other
purpose than to see the life-buoy light burning.” This is a slander.
The truth is, the poor boy had been reading in the fore-chains his
uncle Jones's Ancient America; whereupon, he naturally fell into a
sleep, which lasted many hours, and in his sleep fell overboard . His
life was saved for greater things.
IIowever, we are happy to have heard thus incidentally of the
Boy Jones; as his whereabout is a sufficient evidence of the watch-
fulness of Ministers as regards the designs of France on Morocco.
Sure we are that neither Sin CHARLEs NAPIER nor Lond Minto
would have twitted the Admiralty with neglect had they only known
that the Boy Jon Es was on the Gibraltar station. We at once
acknowledge the profound policy of Ministers: it is their intention to
meet Joinville with the Boy Jones . There is, if we mistake not,
a minor theatre drama called The Prince and the Chimney Sweep :
and we have no doubt that this piece will, sooner or later, be revived
on the high seas, with—as Ma. Oshalpiston has it—“new and
startling effects; the whole to conclude with the destruction of the
enemy's fleet !”
Yes: let Joinville hover on the coast of Morocco, BRITANNIA
may be as mild as a Quakeress, for has she not at Gibraltar her
babe of glory—the JER v is of the chimney—the Nelson of the
larder, her Boy Jones It may, possibly, wound the self-love of
the French to learn that we pit our Jon E3 against their royal
admiral; nevertheless, up to the present moment, is not the achieve-
ment of greatest daring on the side of our hero? We taste the fulness
of content to know it is so. To quote the sweet song of a sweet
singer–
“As the pause upon the ceasing of a thousand-voiced psalm,
Is our mighty satisfaction and full eternal calm,”—
to know that wheresoever Joinville is, there henceforth will be
Jones ; that whensoever it may please the French Admiral to
attempt a descent on Brighton, Margate, or Herne Bay, Jones,
“Like a sweet little cherub will sit up aloft,
And keep watch for the life of John Bull . "
And when some twenty years have passed away, pleasing it will
be to see the Boy Jones—then Post-Captain Jones—kneeling to
receive the honour of knighthood from our darling Queen, sur-
rounded by her seventeen sons and daughters; most pleasant will
it be to mark the sly yet benignant smile with which HER MAJEsty
Vol. VII.-1844,
tlubs the hero who “once caused her so much alarm,”—the intruding
boy, who, according to his own report, once heard the Princess
Roy AI. “squeak.”
We put it to M.R. GroRGE Jones, as a man and an ancient
historian,—should so likely an event come to pass, would he then
deny his nephew, the Boy Jones Punch thinks not.

MR. Punch has the honour to inform the Public that he has lately
Blaughtered a fine Russian Bear,
which has been cut up after the most approved Fashion, and will continue
to be served out for the benefit of the unfortunate Poles of the Metropolis.
The Public are respectfully warned against the nauseous stuff called
“Russian Balm,” which has been laid on so uncommonly thick by some
of MR. Punch's contemporaries. -
QIbrattical Intelligentt.
We understand that the lovely and accomplished dancer of the High-
land Fling at a celebrated suburban Tea-garden has eloped with the
facetious and insinuating primo buffo of a rival establishment. The buffo
had been starring it for a benefit at the Tea-garden where the fair votary
of Terpsichore was permanently engaged, and is said to have won her
heart by the exquisite feeling he threw into the song of “Werry Ridi-
culous.” The inamorata, who had to dance a naval hornpipe immediatel
afterwards, was observed to go through the double shuffle with ...}.
embarrassment, and drops—since supposed to have been tears—were
remarked on her countenance during the final hitching up of the white
trousers at the conclusion of the effort. A short time afterwards, while
the buffo was on the stage, she was seen to watch him with intense
interest, and at a particular passage in “O ! Don't I Love my Mother,”
she was led in strong hysterics to the green-room—a detached section of
the bar-parlour. The first restoratives that were at hand being freely
resorted to, the danseuse became considerably better, and at the end of
the performance neither she nor the buffo were anywhere to be found.
The happy pair were traced as having gone by the “last omnibus,” and
letters were received the next day from Chelsea, stating that they had
been linked in the bands of Hymen, and intended joining in a grand pas
de deur for the remainder of their mutual existence.
The young lady has at present nothing in her own right, and will be
entitled to as much again on the death of all her relatives. The §
Lothario holds a dishonoured bill of a minor theatrical manager, whi.
he endorsed to his lovely partner previous to the performance of the
marriage ceremony, so that it has all the force of a settlement.

PUNCH'S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER. v.
FROM A VERY YoUNG GENTLEMAN TO A FAVOURITE ACTRESS WHOM
HE HAS ONLY SEEN IN PUBLIC.
DEAREst MADAM,
For these past six months I have pulled
against my heart—I have resisted my transports-
I have fought with my passion. Yes—I determined
—I will die, and my consuming secret shall pºlish
with me. Ajas I silence is no longer possible. Your
witcheries of to-night have driven me with whirlwind force to pen
and ink. Your voice is still in my ears—your eyes still upon my
cheek—I will, I must write I
Madam, I have long adored you. Love is my witness, that I never,
hoped to breathe as much ; but after your devotion of this evening
—after the heroic sacrifice that you have made for love—after the
happy willingness you have shown to give up fortune, rank, and
friends, and retire with your lover from the world, though that lover
was but a woodman, with nothing but his axe to provide for you
both, after the development of such a feeling (believe it, adored
one, there was not a dry eye in the pit), I should wrong the sweet
susceptibility of your nature, I should wrong myself, to keep
silence. No ; the way in which you withered the unprincipled
nobleman, the tempting seducer in the second act, convinced me
with an electric shock that we were made for one another I thought
—ecstatic thought !—that catching your eye from the third row, you
read my heart, and, while the theatre rang with plaudits, that our
souls mingled ! Ah was it not so
But why alone speak of your virtues to-night Does not every
night show you more than something earthly In whatever situa-
tion of life you are placed, are you not in all equally angelic Have
I not known you accused of theft, nay, of murder—and have I not
—witness it, Heaven –adored you all the more for the charge Has
accident or malice thrown a shadow over you, that you have not
burst forth all the brighter for the passing gloom And in all these
sorrows I have been with you ! I, from the third row of the pit, have
trembled with you—have visited you in prison—have attended you
to the scaffold's foot, and then, in that delirious moment when the
spoons were found, or the child, thought dead, ran on in a white
frock, then have I, though still in the third row, caught you inno-
cent to my arms, and wept in ecstacy 1
As a daughter, have I not seen you all your father ould wish
As a wife, have you not cast a lustre upon all your wedding-rings-
as a young and tender mother—pardon me, sweet one,—have you
not been more devoted than the pelican, gentler than the dove
How was it possible, then, for six months to behold you, moving
in and adorning every sphere—now to see you the polished countess,
now the simple country maid — now smiling at want, and now
giving away an unconsidered number of bank-notes, how, in the
name of Cupid, I ask it, was it possible even from the third row of
the pit to behold all this, and not as I have done to worship you ?
Shall I, ought I, to attempt to describe to you my feelings for one
night 1 Will my lovo bear with me while I write Why do I ask t
Can I doubt it 1
Exactly at half-past six—my heart, my best watch-I take the
third seat of the pit. Often, for many minutes, I am there alone.
I like it—I enjoy the solitude. I have often wished that not another
soul would enter the theatre, that I might, a mental epicure, have
all the feast to myself. I seem to grudge every man his seat, as
slowly one by one drops in. I unwillingly suffer anybody to partici-
pate in your smiles and honied words. No : I would have you act
all to myself. Even applause sometimes throws me into a dangerous
paroxysm: I feel it as an intrusion on my privilege that any one
should dare to applaud but me; my blood boils to my fingers' ends;
but I suppress my feelings, and have as yet, though sorely tempted,
knocked no man from his seat. -
I have breathed the secret of my love to nobody; and yet my eyes
must have betrayed me. Forgive me; I could not control my eyes.
Methinks you ask me, who has discovered my love? Smile not, I
will tell you; the fruit-women. Good creatures 1 there is not one
who does not hurry to me with a play-bill, folded down at the
glorious letters that compose your name, her finger—as though by
accident–pointed at the soul-delighting word. I will not tell you
how I treasure those bills; no, you shall never know that every such
play-bill is folded beneath my pillow at night, and is resigned to a
morocco portfolio in the morning; my sensations at the theatre first
briefly marked in the margin. This you shall never know.
Let me, however, return to my third seat. The curtain is down
—the orchestra yet empty. That curtain seems to shut me from
Paradise, for I know you are behind it. The musicians come in, and
my heart begins to throb at the overture. The play begins; perhaps
you are discovered in Scene I., in the depths of misery—how
deliciously my brain beats to know it. You speak; and all my veins
are throbbing like the tongue of a Jew's-harp. Perhaps you sing ;
and then I feel a kind of sweet swooning sickness—a sort of death
made easy—that I can't describe. At times you dance; and then
do I seem lifted by some invisible power, and made to float about
you. Then you leave the stage, and all who come after are no
more to me than jointed dolls with moving eyes. How I loathe
the miserable buffoon—the comedy-man, as he is called—who, while
I am languishing for your next appearance, makes the empty audience
laugh about me : such mirth seems an insult to my feelings—a dese-
cration of my love. No 1 you from the stage, plot and players are
lost to me; I sit, only thinking of your return—sometimes abstracted
from the scene, mechanically counting the scattered hairs in the
head of the first fiddle.
And thus, until the curtain is about to drop, and then—my heart
with it—I throw abouquet, that has nestled all the night in my button-
hole, at your fairy feet. Then do I rush from the pit to the stage-
door; and there—the more delighted if it rains—there do Istand, until
sweetly cloaked and shawled, I watch you—see your Adelaide boots
emerge into the street, and, with a thought, vanish into cab or coach.
Ha! the door is closed with a slam that seems to snap my heart-
strings. The horse-shoes sound in the distance—I am alone. I
wander to my lodgings, sometimes in despair, and sometimes in
delirious spirits, feeling that I have your arm warm and pressing
under mine, and still seeing your eyes look at me, as I thought they
looked at the third row of the pit.
I arrive at my cold lodging. Yet, ere I sleep, I look at your dozen
faces—for I have at least a dozen—plain and coloured, hung about
my walls. Yes, my beloved one there you are, and though only
published from half-a-crown to five shillings, worlds should not buy
you of me ! -
If you have played a new part, I touch no breakfast until I read
the papers. How my heart goes down upon its knees to the sensible
critic who tries—although vainly—to sing your full deserts; whilst
for the wretch who finds fault, or—but enough on this disgusting
theme. There are monsters in the human form who write so-called
criticisms for newspapers.
And now, my dearest love, in the same spirit of frankness—with
that boundless gush of affection—which you have so wonderfully
developed to-night—with that fervor and truth which prove to me
that we were born for one another, and that I have too rightly
read your heart to believe that my want of fortune will be any
defect in your eyes—rather, indeed, I should say, from what I have
seen to-night, a recommendation—
I remain,
Your devoted Lover,
CHARLEs Spoonhill.
P.S. Please, dearest, leave an answer at the stage-door. And,
dearest, pray let me catch your eye in the third row to-morrow,

LETTER WI.
ANSWER FROM THE ACTRESS'S FATHER TO THE VERY YOUNG
GENTLeMAn.
SIR,
You are either a madman or a fool. I have to inform you
that I usually carry a stout stick. Any more letters to my daughter,
and you may become acquainted with it. Should you, however, be
beyond my power of chastisement, there is a certain gentleman, to
whom, on the advice of my daughter, I have only to show your letter,
and he will commission his footman to thrash you as your imperti.
mence deserves.
Your obedient Servant.
Thespis Buantcork.
P.S. In future I shall keep my eye upon the third row of the pit.
CULINARY INTELLIGENCE.
WE see by the papers that “M. SoYER (the cook) remains at the Reform
Club, with the confidence of the members, if possible, increased.” We
happen to know that the increase of confidence has been immense, for a
member who orders a chop no longer makes any observation as to how
he would like it done, but leaves it entirely to the discretion of M. Soyer.
We understand that the chef de cuisine is so extremely sensitive that he
has been known to shed tears if a person ordering a basin of mutton broth
has asked for the pepper, because the mere demand seems to throw a
doubt on M. SoYER's powers of seasoning. At a recent house-dinner, a
member of the committee held in his hand the resignation of M. Soy ER,
which was to have been peremptorily given in if a new arrangement of
beef collops had been in the smallest degree objected to. By some this
step may be regarded as unconstitutional ; and it is probable that M. SoYER
had in his remembrance the extreme step taken by EARL GREY to ensure
the passing of the Reform Bill, when he caused it to be given out that he
had in his pocket a carte blanche for the creation of Peers. The collops,
however, on coming to a division, were perfectly successful, and their
principle unanimously approved.
We understand that M. Soy ER has a few young gentlemen reading with
him, as pupils, in his chambers; and that one of them, who is studying for
the made-dish department, corresponding to what, in the legal profession,
would be called the chancery, is likely to rise to culinary eminence. On
the simple joint-side of the kitchen, or rather the common law of cookery,
there is not so much scope for genius.
Punch's Visit to the New Houses of Parliament.
PUNCH having determined to pay a visit to the New Houses of Parlia-
ment, proceeded thither without attendants in a public cab, and having
reached the entrance to the works, he found no one in readiness to receive
him. Having kicked for some minutes against the wooden hoarding with-
out effect, he went round to the Victoria Tower, where a policeman was
in waiting, who did not seem at all prepared for Punch's visit, and the
“authority” consequently took no notice of the illustrious visiter. Punch
therefore satisfied himself with measuring the width of the carriage
entrance, which he discovered to be nine feet four inches, and as the state
carriage happens to be nine feet six inches wide, he begs leave to ask–
by way of a sum in division—how many times the state carriage may
be expected to go into the Victoria Tower, and how much will remain
over. The top of the Tower also, on measurement, appears to be nine
feet six, while the bottom is only nine feet four, and as it is a rule of gra-
vitation that the greater weight must crush the lower, Punch will be glad
to know when the top of the #. may be expected to reach the bottom 1
THE BLESSING OF BAD HEALTH.
A short time ago the English and Irish papers rang with the
musical name of O'Daiscoll, a gentleman of exceeding bad health,
and with temper to match, who, for certain peculiarities, was removed
by Ministers from the magistracy. O'DaiscoLL had a taste for
tyranny beyond even the ordinary stomach of a thorough-going
Irishman “in the peace,” and he was unwillingly sacrificed to the
indignation of the country. The scales were taken from the hand
better strung to wield a shillelah; and, in brief, O'Driscoll was
banished to the decent obscurity of private life.
And now, within a few short months, O'Daiscoll is again a
magistrate 1
“Ask ye, Boeotian shades, the reason why tº
In the first place, sundry good-natured souls have petitioned for
his restoration; and, secondly, it is averred that “his health” is now
sufficiently amended to enable him to decently perform his magiste-
rial functions: all his former eccentricities being clearly referable to
a bodily ailment. He has really carried out the vain promise of
Falstaff—has “lived cleanly,” and is therefore again fitted for the
bench.
And do we object to this charitable construction of the causes of
human infirmity? Assuredly not. On the contrary, we hail it as an
evidence of enlarged benevolence—of increasing philosophy. We
consider it as beautifully illustrative of the fact that the Prime
Minister was called in as a “Doctor” to watch over the condition of
the state. All, however, we require, is an impartial operation of the
principle. If MR. O'DR1scoLL's previous bad behaviour was nothing
but bad digestion, why should not O'Connell be permitted to plead
derangement of stomach for his agitation in the cause of destitute
Ireland Why should not even SIR JAMEs GRAHAM be allowed to
defend his Post-Office malpractices on a superabundance of bile !
Why should not poorness of blood sufficiently excuse the act of those
hon. members who voted on both sides on the Sugar Bill We are
willing that O'Daiscoll should be saved by the temporary derange-
ment of his nerves—but then we must exact the like charitable
indulgence for all parties. Why, indeed, should the authors and
defenders of the Poor Law bear so much really unmerited obloquy,
when they are not morally culpable When they might show that
the measure originated in no moral obliquity, but in nothing more
than a bodily disease—as O'Daiscoll would say, a mere ossification
of the heart
It is by no means fair that BARBER's medical man was not ex-
amined on the trial to show the condition of his patient's health
when Fletch En tempted him in re SLAck. Proved indigestion
might, otherwise, have saved the culprit ; and, as in the case of
O'Driscoll, he might by this time have been labouring in his old
office. O'Daiscoll, committing all sorts of enormities in the very
weakness of delicate health, is cashiered from the bench. He is,
however, convalescent, and is therefore restored to the commission.
Who could have thought there was such intimate connexion between
Justice and Blue Pill
Henceforth, we think, a certain number of physicians should be
appointed to sit with the judges; and, in lieu of the old interrogative
“Guilty,” or “Not Guilty,” the sworn physician, addressing the
accused, should simply say—
“Show the bench your tongue !”
Indeed, after the restoration of O'DR1scoll, we cannot well imagine
the justice of any other ordeal.
ARCADIAN SIMPLICITY.
ConsideBABLE inconvenience is experienced by the occasional visiters of
the Opera in consequence of the recently-erected Watch-box of the Beadle
of the Opera Arcade, which is so constructed that it looks very like an
extra pit door, and a crowd frequently collects round it, in the expectation
that it will be opened at the usual hour. A few evenings ago, when the
public were being admitted at the regular pit door, the most tremendous
indignation was manifested against the watch-box, and there were loud
cries of “shame” vented on the management for not opening at the same
time all the places of ingress to the Theatre. One night last week the
Beadle had fallen asleep, over a cup of tea in his box; and he was only
roused by the violent kickings of an excited mob, who, on his looking
through the round glass hole, assailed him with the most vehement exe-
crations. The unhappy official continued for some hours in a state of
blockade, and was ultimately rescued by the shopkeepers, who came
forward to explain the mistake that the crowd had fallen into.

The Dogs have got their committee in the Lower liouse, but there is
a deep old, dog in the Upper House, of whom it is said by many, that
nothing will satisfy him. This is a downright libel, for the cunning old
dog has got nothing and is not satisfied, so that when it is said he will be
satisfied with nothing, a gross untruth is told regarding him. The dog
alluded to labours under the disadvantage of dealing with a crafty old
bird, one of those who cannot be caught by chaff, and it is well that he
cannot, or, he would long ago have fallen a victim to the bowing and
wowing; the pawing, and crouching of the dog in question. The manner
in which ºur artist has drawn him, looking up with a mingled expression

PUNCH TO DANIEL IN PRISON,
IMMURED in Dublin's prison base,
Great DANIEL, while thou smartest,
'Tis thus thy venerable face
Appeared to Punch's artist.
He reads those weekly bulletins,
Which of your health inform us.
And thus the prisoner paints, who grins
Contented and enormous !
Perhaps the wicked limner shows,
Inclined to laughter spiteful,
That certain patriots' vaunted woes
Are not so tery frightful.
Perhaps he would insinuate,
By that stupendous figure,
ſ That those who free are Truly Great,
When wronged are Doubly Bigger
I know not which ; but love to read -
Each speech of DAN the younger,
Which tells us how your people feed
Their chief's imprisoned hunger.
IIow matrons cook you soups and broths,
IIow cakes are baked by virgins,
IIow weavers weave your table-cloths,
And fishers hook you sturgeons."
Says DAN, “My father's cheek's as red,
His mood as blithe and merry,
As when at morn his dogs he led
Along the hills of Kerry. l
His mighty lungs more free to talk,
II is body stronger waxen,
Than when at Tara or Dundalk,
He bullyragged the Saxon.”
Amen I hope the tale is true,
Thus brought by Irish rumour;
May each day's prison bring to you
Good health, sir, and good humour !
Amen, cries Lord Chief Justice Punch,
Approving of your sentence,
It is, I swear it by my hunch,
A jovial repentance
No chains shall in his prison clink,
| No ruthless jailor urge him,
With lashings of the best of drink
I'd pitilessly scourge him.
'Tis thus that noble Justice Punch
Would treat his Celtic neighbour,
And thus at dinner, supper, lunch,
Condemn him to “hard labour.”
Nor you alone but good son John,
And RAY, and STEELE, and DUFFY ;
Ye dire Repealers every one,
Remorselessly I’d stuff yel
I'd have you all, from last to first,
To grow such desperate gluttons, |
That you should eat until ye burst |
Your new Repealers' Buttons !”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 41
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
PART II.
CHAPTER THE THIRD-OF TENURES, or THE MANNER IN WHICH
REAL PROPERTY MAY BE HELD.
Ll real property is held—and it is generally pretty
tightly held by those who possess it. This
tenacity of property is such that the thing
holden is called a tenement, the holder a
tenant, and the mode of holding a tenure.
There is another mode of holding, called
holding hard, which is frequently used in
conveyancing—by the cad of the omnibus.
Tenements are of two kinds—frank tene-
ment, or free holding, and villenage, of
which there are different degrees, including
pure villenage and villein socage. A pure
villain is such a very low sort of villain
that he must do whatever his landlord
commands; but socage villains, or villain
socmen, are not such villanous villains, inasmuch as there is a limit to
their villany, the services required of them being certain and definite.
The most honourable species of tenure was knight service, which was
to attend the King in his wars; but sovereigns in these days instead of
fighting boldly, invariably fight shy, so that knight service, or, attendance
on the King in his wars is now merely nominal. There is also a tenure
by grand serjeanty, by which the tenant bound himself to do some special
service, such as acting as champion at the coronation; but as all improper
characters are scrupulously kept out by the police, the valour, of coming
forward in a suit of armour, and offering to fight any body who disputes
the title to the crown, is rather questionable. The champion, however,
pockets the gold cup and a few other valuable coronation,” properties,” so
that he can afford to throw down a large theatrical gauntlet, which by-the-
by is invariably “smugged” by some subordinate as a perquisite. . .
Knight service eventually was found so inconvenient that the knights
gave money instead of going to battle, and thus paid themselves off, rather
than run the risk of being paid off by the enemy.
By the 12th of Charles II. all military tenures were destroyed at one
blow, for knights, being of no service had long since converted knight
service into a farce of the broadest character.
Socage subsequently became the most general kind of tenure, so that
the tenants, to use the quaint notion of GLANvil, “rushed precipitately
from boots and spurs to simple socks—or socs; which is, no doubt, the
origin of the word soc-age.”
ree socage has several kinds, the chief of which are petit-serjeanty,
or little service, such as giving the King annually an arrow, or a lance;
but it does not seem that lancing the King's gums once a year would
amount to petit-serjeanty-tenure in burgage, where the tenant lives in a
borough, so that the Southwark people afford a specimen of this class,
and gavelkind, where all the sons take alike, so that when a father gives
his boys a thrashing all round, he in fact only illustrates the good old
principle of gavelkind.
We now come to villenage, from which copyhold tenures are derived,
so that any copyholder is a villain in the eye of the law ; and it is
F. on this principle that the printer's boy who carries to and fro or
olds the copy, is termed a devil, to show the alarming state of villenage
he has fallen into.
A copyhold must always exist in a manor, which must have a court
attached to it, with a jury consisting of two tenants at least, or the
manor is lost; so that if manners do not always make the man, it requires
two men to make the manor.
A part of the ground of a manor was called folk-land, or land for the
folks who lived upon it, who were downright slaves to the owner;
and as they were called villains, it is probable that Folkstone was, at one
time, a very villanous neighbourhood. When the Normans came over
to this country they did not proceed to kick out the villains, but allowed
them to remain on the land, until at last the villains got a better title to
the land by custom than the lords themselves by conquest; for the
stewards of the manors merely looking on and taking notes, the villains
referring to the copy on the rolls of the court, declared themselves copy-
holders to all intents and purposes. The essentials of a copyhold are–
| 1st, that the lands should be part of a manor, and consequently of right
belonging to somebody else; 2ndly, that they have been demised by copy
of court-roll immemorially, for if any one can remember the transaction
it is bad, because the thing will not bear thinking of.
There is a fine payable on the death of the tenant or alienation of the
lands, and this fine is now in most cases limited by law; because, says
| GLANVIL, “when the landlords could lay on as large a fine as they liked,
they made a very fine thing of it.” The italics are GLANvil's own, so
that the joke must be given to him, though later writers, including four
of the CHITTYs, have made a severe struggle to obtain the merit of it.
Ancient demesne is a sort of privileged villenage, the villains who enjoy
it having the privilege of paying no taxes, and of holding a court of
their own to try their own rights to their own—and, perhaps, other
people's-property. The villains, however, can only alienate their land
by surrender, instead of passing it by the usual conveyance; but a recent
writer has thought it necessary to state in a note, that though the villains
may not pass their land by the usual conveyance, there is no law to
prevent them from going past their own houses in a stage-coach or
omnibus.
In addition to the lay tenures there used to be the spiritual tenure of
frankalmoign, by which .." corporations held lands on condition of
singing masses for the soul of the donor. These masses amassing too
much in the hands of the church, and weak-minded persons, attracted by
the notion of having psalms sung for them, having been let in to a very
retty tune, the statute of Quia emplores was passed in the 18th of
dward I., to prohibit all such donations for the future. Many of the
parochial clergy still hold their lands by this tenure, which accounts for
a congregation being occasionally startled by a demand of their prayers
for some one who would never be thought of either by parson or people,
but for the necessity of observing the conditions by which the Church
retains possession of the deceased's property.
IN MY COTTAGE NEAR A “RAIL.”
In my cottage near a “rail,”
Bliss and Betsy now are mine;
Bliss how very like a whale,
Wedded love beside a “line !”
Clatter, clatter, horrid row !
Puff and whistle, scream and whizz ;
Oh you can't imagine how
Disagreeable it is.
Wain the sigh, the whisper vain,
Breathed in Passion's fond excess;
Rattling by, the thund'ring train
Burks the voice of Tenderness.
Oft at eve will BETsy dear
Sit and sing me “Alice Grey”—
But that engine, boiling near,
Always drowns my fav'rite lay.
Ever at the morning's meal,
Or the happy hour of tea,
All our cups and saucers reel,
Often spilling the bohea;
Floors, and walls, and windows shake,
Just as though the house would fall ;
And our heads, moreover, ache,
With the smoke, and smell, and all.
Oh! for some sequester'd spot,
Far from stokers and from steam,
Where we might enjoy our lot,
Realising Love's young dream.
Would we had not ta'en a lease,
(Foolish pair, ourselves to nail :)—
Soon we'd fly, in quest of peace,
From our cottage near a “rail.”
Alteration in the style of Domestic Correspondence.
In consequence of the late disclosures, the custom has become pretty
eneral—with a view to prevent the whole of a letter from meeting the
#. eye-of making it evident, in the first sentence, that the
writer is aware of its probable fate, and, therefore, unlikely to inclose a
Gunpowder Plot; as thus—“My dear MARIANNE,-Since SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM and I last heard from you of Bobby's hooping cough, we have
been naturally anxious for more,” &c. Some have even made use of a
domestic communication as a short, though indirect, method of presenting
a petition to the Home Office; considering, that one so presented is sure
at least of being read; thus—“My dear FANNY,+If, as you say, the
admirable Minister, who at present presides at the Home Office, could
only be made aware of the extreme hardship of my case, I am convinced
that he would, without a moment's hesitation, following the dictates of an
excellent heart,” &c., &c., &c. This is an ingenious course, and Punch
means to adopt it.
STATE OF HERNE-BAY.
We much regret to state that it has been found absolutely necessary to
call in an additional body of police for the government of this flourishing
watering-place. Up to the present year there has been only one
policeman; there are now—two t

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PRIVILEGE OF COUNSEL.
LoRD $3Rough AM is of opinion that an advocate ought to sink every
consideration for the interest of his client—that, in fact, a counsel ought
to forget himself—a thing which Lond BRough AM constantly does when
sticking up for his new friends, the Conservatives.
MR. Charles Phillips was a pupil in the same school, and sacrificed,
or attempted to sacrifice, two or three characters in addition to his own,
when insisting on the innocence of Counvoisien, who had confessed his
guilt to his zealous advocate. However, “the instructions” are every-
thing. Counsel must do as they are instructed, and MR. Cockburn, when
he brought certain accusations against Lord GeoRGE BENTINck, which the
latter had no opportunity of disproving, was only acting in obedience to
his instructions. What those instructions were may be judged from the
following extract from the
IBrief for the Plaintiff.
“Counsel is requested to bully Lord GeoRGE BENTINck.
“It may be as well to observe that he has tampered with the witnesses,
and to prove that he has tampered, counsel may put the question at
random to any of the shrewdest rascals that may happen to be in the box,
and who have an interest in the success of the plaintiff. One of the
witnesses has a new suit of clothes. It is suggested that counsel had
better get out, if he can, that Lond GeoRGE BENTINck bought the clothes
with the view of corrupting the witness. It may, perhaps, be urged that
these things have nothing to do with the matter at issue between the
parties; but it may divert attention from the merits, to bully a nobleman,
who is not a party, and the jury may be confused if it is represented that
he is indirectly a party to the suit. Counsel will, of course, use his
discretion,” &c., &c., &c.
Sporting Intelligence.
We perceive, with considerable satisfaction, that a new branch of sport
has lately rushed into popularity. Swimming has recently become the
subject of considerable excitement, and a match took place in a large tank
somewhere in Holborn, when six swimmers contended for the champion-
ship of the cistern. The race consisted of three heats, twelve times the
entire length of the tank ; and the swimmers started off on the firing of a
signal gun—which, we presume, must have been a pop-gun—in order to
accommodate the nerves of the audience. We understand that it is intended
to render swimming—if possible—a sort of rival to horse-racing, and that
there will be an attempt to get up a species of St. Leger, to be called the
St. Swithin's, in the Serpentine. We heartily wish success to this whole-
some branch of British Sportsmanship.
on THE UNCURBED LICENCE OF COUNSel.
By dealing out invective vain,
From his instructions false and idle,
The advocate of Running Rein
Prov'd that his tongue required a bridle.
PEEL'S ULTIMATUM.
We were not astonished at the “Dogs’ Protection Bill,” as we felt con-
fident, months ago, that, as Parliament was going on, it was sure, before
the Session was over, to go to the dogs.

FAIR SUFFERERS.
By fair sufferers we mean about ninety-nine out of every hundred of
those poor dear young ladies, condemned, through the accident of their
birth, to languish, in silk and satin, beneath the load of a fashionable
existence.
Ah! little think the gay licentious paupers, who have no plays, operas,
and evening parties to be forced to go to, and no carriages to be obliged
to ride about in, of the miseries which are endured by the daughters of
affluence 1
It is a well-known fact, that scarcely one of these tender creatures can
be in a theatre or a concert-room ten minutes without being seized with a
violent headach, which, more frequently than not, obliges her to leave
before the performance is over, and drag a brother, husband, lover, or
attentive young man, away with her. If spared the headache, how often
is she threatened with a fainting fit (nay, now and then seized with it),
to the alarm and disturbance of her company | Not happening to feel
faint exactly, still there is a sensation, “a something,” as she describes
it, “she doesn’t know what,” which she is almost sure to be troubled with.
Unvisited by these afflictions, nevertheless, either the cold, or the heat,
or the glare of the gas, or some other source of pain, oppresses or ex-
cruciates her susceptible nerves. And when we take one such young
lady, and put together all the public amusements which she must either
go to—or die—in the course of a London season; and when we add up all
the headaches, and swoons, and the somethings she doesn't know what ;
the shiverings, burnings, and other agonising sensations which she has
undergone by the end of it; the result is an aggregate of torture truly
frightful to contemplate.
Suppose she is obliged to walk;-this is sometimes actually the case:—
happy is she if she can go twenty yards without some pain or other; in
the side, the back, the shoulder, the great toe. Thus the pleasure of
shopping, promenading, or a pic-nic is embittered : thus is colocynth
infused into the eau sucré of bliss
If she reads a chapter in a novel, the chances are that her temples throb
for it. She tries to embroider a Corsair ; doing more than an arm of him
at a time strains her eyes. Employ herself in what way she will, she
feels fatigued afterwards, and may think herself well off if she is no worse.
Nine days out of ten she has no appetite : on the tenth she enjoys her
dinner, and is taken ill. Then comes that horrid physic 1 She cannot
take pills: she objects to powders: draughts are insufferable to her.
Poor unfortunate 1. What is she to do
Without a care to vex her, save, perhaps, some slight misgivings respect-
ing the Captain, she is unable to rest, though on a couch of down. Exer-
cise would procure her slumber; but oh she cannot take it.
Whether a little less confinement of the waist, earlier hours, plainer
luncheons, more frequent airings in the green fields, and mental and bodily
exertion generally, than what, in these respects, is the fashionable usage,
would in any way alleviate the miseries of our fair sufferers, may be
questioned. It may be also inquired how far such miseries are imaginary,
and to what extent a trifling exercise of resolution would tend to mitigate
them Otherwise, supposing them to be ills that woman is necessarily
heiress to—unavoidable, irremediable: gracious powers I what torments,
what anguish, must fishwomen, washerwomen, charwomen, and hay-
makers, to say nothing of servants of all work, and even ladies' maids,
endure every day of their lives |
Puncta's Indian Mail.
The Punjaub is in a frightful state; and all the Sings—inciuding MEER
SING, Sherr Sing, RUNJEET Sing, ITTUR SING, Dhyan SING, and about
ten more of this very pugnacious family—continue to be at most dreadful
loggerheads. Mohammed had refused to put down his Dost, a distinction
which has always occasioned much jealousy to the rival potentates.
Literary INTELLIGENCE.
MR. O'Connell is devoting his leisure in prison to a new and important
work—a second series of “The Epicure's Almanac : or a Dish for Every
Day in the Year.”
Editorial Thanksgiving.
TheRE are, at present, no less than forty-seven Editors of newspapers
imprisoned in France. It is lucky for the English press that Ma.
Roebuck does not possess the same power as Louis Philippe, or else
Newgate would contain three times the above number; that is to say,
every editor in the kingdom who would not praise him.
CELESTIAL SARCASM,
CAPT. Pidding tells us, in his Tea Talk, that the Chinese call America
“the flowery country.” . This looks as if Jonathan had been trying to
pass off in China some of his Pennsylvanian bonds.

PUNCH, OR THE I,
ONDON CHARIVARſ. 43
THE * BUSINESS" of PARLIAMENT.
A sunrise or so ago we paused, as once Wordsworth paused on
Westminster Bridge, and, smitten by the scene, fell, like the poet of
Rydal Mount, into deep, philosophic thinking. We thought of the
Abbey, and of the twopences taken at its doors; we thought of the
Dean and Chapter, and their tenants; of the Almonry; of the rejected
statue of BYRoN, and of the onslaught of BARon FitzHARDINGE.-
And then we turned towards the rising walls of the new Houses of
Parliament, and, thinking of their cost, asked despairingly what is
the good of them?
Yes, fellow-countrymen, we put it to you—are not Houses of Parlia-
ment, old and new, vain and useless as Egyptian cenotaphs We
put it to the industrious and dispassionate man, who, with a patience
that must surely be a set-off to some minor sins, plods his way
through the daily debates of Parliament—we put it to him whether
the business of the country, as it is gravely called by some droll
talkers, might not be more efficiently performed by some mechanic
means than by the six hundred and fifty-eight learned individuals
who meet in February to do everything, and separate in August,
having done nothing? Really, the trick is now so old, that we
wonder at the courage of any set of Ministers who can repeat it.
At the opening of the Session, how beautiful is legislative alacrity
Measure after measure is promised—nay, is fairly brought in—has
one, perhaps two readings, and is dropped for another session to be
dropped again. A night or two since, Si R Rob ERT PEEL, with one
of his blandest smiles, informed the House that he would let it know
what time it had lost upon bills not to be proceeded with ; yes, he
would count the addled eggs, and in the ensuing session they might
—poor, defrauded geese l—sit again. If HERR Döhl ER or the
Wizard of the North were to conjure after this fashion, the audience
would tear up the benches.
Returning to the new Houses of Parliament, we must again protest
against the money lavished upon them. For what business, we ask,
has been effected in the present session that might not have been as
efficiently transacted in a sentry-box Wherefore, then, these costly
buildings for men to do nothing in Why, indeed, should we have
Members of Parliament at all, when sure we are that MR. BABBAGE
would construct a legislating machine, which, in the hands of Sin
Robert PEEL, would fully answer all the purposes of living
senators
We are serious. We therefore propose that, at the next election,
every gentleman desirous of affixing M.P. to his name should, on his
election, send his proxy machine to the House of Commons, setting
the instrument at “Aye” and “No,” as MR. BABBAG E will instruct
him, on certain questions, and suffering the Ministry to take their
divisions accordingly. The result of the present session convinces
us that the “business of the country” will be got through quite as
well as by the present mode; with this advantage, that the machines
may be put anywhere.
THE CHIMES FOR THE ROYAL EXCHANGE.
It is stated in the papers, that Professor TAYLOR is composing a tune to
be played by the bells of the Royal Exchange. We have no doubt that
the Professor, who liberally abuses the compositions of everybody else, in
the calm columns of the Spectator, will find himself quite at home in his
task. If the bells are to be exposed to draughts, and are liable to be moved
about by the air, the music will, of course, consist of a passage for the
wind instruments; but if they are to be pulled by ropes, it is the stringed
instruments they will bear the nearest resemblance to.
It is to be regretted that the Committee did not place the bells in the
hands of Doctor MENDElssohn while he was in England; and if they had
allowed him full play, he would certainly have struck out something
worthy of himself, of the City, and of the bellhanger. By-the-by, it
would not have been a bad idea to have adapted Schiller's Song of the
Bell, as a solo for the largest bell, assisted by a chorus of little ones. We
understand that the question was raised in the Committee, whether Auben
or Donizetti should not be invited over to this country for the purpose of
composing the chimes for the bells, as it was thought that, when Her
Majesty attends at the opening of the Royal Exchange, the works of a
French or Italian master would sound more gratefully in the ears of royalty.
A Porlorn Hope,
THE Irish papers announce that the “Rent” this year will be upwards
of 30,000l. e understand that poor Louis Philippe, disappointed in
his dotations, has written to Dan to ask him “to do a bill.”
BANKRUPTCY EXTRAORDINARY.
Before SIR. C. F. Williams.
At the sitting of the Court, a figure entered, looking as pale as death,
and begged to be allowed to surrender himself as a Bankrupt.
The figure represented himself as the statue of Nelson, now and for
some time past of Trafalgar
Square. He stated that a few
friends had been desirous of
setting him up in the neigh-
bourhood of Charing Cross,
where he had hoped to have
cut a good figure, but want
of money had for a long time
kept him down, and he had
been completely laid upon his
back for a very considerable
period.
SiR C. F. Williams. What
do you want here I sit here
to do justice, and if justice is
not most thoroughly done in
every sense of the word, it is
no fault of mine.
The figure observed that he
came to surrender, and to ask
for protection against the nu-
merous jokes that were being
made at his (the statue's) ex-
pense, and which were really
almost enough to break a heart
of stone.
SIR. C. F. Williams. I can
give you no protection against
jokes. I can't protect myself.
I have been nearly joked off
this chair on several occasions.
The figure said he really could not tell. A man and a boy had been
employed, who had left no stone unturned, but he (the figure) was not
aware whether they had been paid for their labour.
Sir C. F. WILLIAMs asked if there was any truth in the report that the
statue contemplated throwing himself off the pedestal, in consequence of
his awkward position. -
The figure, with large drops of stucco standing in his eyes, observed
that he had never thought of throwing himself on the public by jumping
down ; but he admitted that, if he had had sufficient rope, he might as
well have hanged himself.
SIR. C. F. WILLIAMs. How much rope have you, then
The figure said he had got a coil of about a yard, till some of it was
cut away, for what reason he did not know—for he was just as much tied
by the leg now as he had been always.
SiR C. F. Williams asked if the statue had no friends who would set
him up respectably
The figure replied that his best friends were for withdrawing him alto-
gether from public observation. He would sooner pave the public
street than be knocked about and taken to pieces as he had been lately.
SIR. C. F. Williams. I sit here as a commissioner, and I really can do
nothing.
The figure said he had heard so before; and having thanked the Com-
missioner, he was carried out by the man and the boy who were appointed
assignees under the bankruptcy.
What is the extent of your liabilities :

Bottled ALE. QuART.o. ABBOTT, LATE Hodgson AND ABBOTT.—London.
We have dipped into this production, and are happy to be able to
express a favourable opinion of its merits. Much that comes before us
for criticism is intolerably dry, but that which we now have the pleasure
to discuss is quite of an opposite character. It appeals to the head rather
than the heart, but it possesses all the sweetness of the Meux combined
with the bluff bluntness of the BARclay. At present we speak only of the
quarto edition. When we see it complete in a cask, we shall have a better
opportunity of judging more fully of its qualities.
The Gallic Gasconades,
The Morning Chronicle says that the reserve of the French Navy is
very considerable. The great reserve of the Navy renders Joinvilla's
utter want of reserve—or, in other words, his excessive impudence-n
matter for increased astonishment.

THE DEBTORS' NEW GAOLER.
Loud CorteNHAM brings in a Bill for the Total Abolition of Arrest for
Debt: the measure is received with the apparent good will of all parties.
In a few weeks, and, save the fraudulent debtor, no man will be imprisoned
for his poverty. This prospect, however, is too delightful for Lond
Baoughim. So he goes to work-tinkers up another bill—and manages
to throw Lord Cottenham's measure into the hopelessness of a select
committee: no more of it will be heard this session. Thus the hundreds
of debtors confined throughout the country may consider Lond BRougham |
AND WAux their new gaoler, self-appointed |
IRISH RAZORS.
PUNCH's oration and humble expostulation at the blood-thirsty indignation
of the Editor of the “Nation,” whom he treats to a jobation.)
SoME genius has been presenting MR. O'Con NELL with a pair of
“rale Irish shuperfine silver-steel rasiers,” which have been exhibited
by MR. D. O'Connell, jun., at the Corn Exchange, with great ap-
plause, as beautiful specimens of Irish talent and Irish manufacture.
Mn. W. J. O'Connell (determined to cut blocks with a razor)
nobly said: “He hoped those razors, so kindly presented to the
illustrious incarcerated leading friend of Ireland, would cut bigotry
and intolerance through for ever.”
But this magnificent wish is nothing compared to the graceful and
ingenious plan proposed by the Nation newspaper, which says: “We
observe among the presents to O'Conn ELL last week, a pair of razors,
of Irish manufacture. When the writ of error succeeds, we will
make a special request that he will bestow them to T. B. C. SMITH
and Abhali AM BREwst En For obvious PUR poses.”
Mr. Punch compliments the Nation upon this smart and manly
joke j upon the Christian principle which it evinces, the gay and
playful wit it exhibits, and the spirit of generous fair-play which
distinguishes it.
Mr. Punch has published six volumes quarto of jokes, of which
he is naturally a little proud—but he confesses that in all those
thousands of pages there is not one epigram at all equal for sharp-
ness to the razor-allusion of ‘the Nation.”
Were Mr. Punch disposed to be bitter, he would hint to the Joker
of the Nation, that the razor-allusion is rather stale in Ireland,
where Parties have been accustomed to cut each other's throats
from time immemorial.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
But Mr. Punch is averse to retort, and declines (from a regard to
his fingers) to meddle with edge-tools; he would, therefore, only
suggest to his confrère, the Editor of the Nation, to try upon the
amateur assassin who wrote that dastardly joke, not the razor, but
the strap.

THE PHILOSOPHY OF NECESSITY.
(An Appendir to a book so called, lately published.)
The first point in the Philosophy of Necessity is, to be impressed with
the necessity of philosophy. Philosophers very often find themselves in
necessity; and they should take care not to lose themselves in it. In
fact, necessity frequently arises from º which tends rather to
make a man think deeply than look sharply; however, where necessity
begins, philosophy commonly ends; in like manner as when it effects an
entrance by the door, it causes something else (very different from
philosophy) to make an exit by the window.
The Philosopher in Necessity will sometimes find his coat out at elbows.
Natural Philosophy, under such circumstances, suggests the victimisation
of the tailor; but Moral Philosophy prescribes consideration for the
sufferer. Practical Philosophy falls back on patching and patience.
Very often, when Self, communing with Self, asks whether a dinner at
VEREY's would be advisable, Appetite replies “Yes,” but Necessity
answers in the negative. Philosophy, under these circumstances, recom-
mends the eightpenny plate.
Necessity, when it surveys its boot, often beholds a Coburg, where
Taste would have preferred to see a Wellington. Or aghast, in the
sides of the same, it discovers an awful burst. Vanity would repine ;
but Philosophy whispers comfort. “What,” it inquires, “is the value
of mere externals Thou hast a soul ; what will thy boots be to it a
century hence Beatitude is a phase of mind; and what mattereth it,
so long as thou art in a state of felicity ?”
The four-and-nine is less elegant than the velvet nap ; the Berlin glove
than the Paris kid ; less agreeable is the cotton than the silk pocket-
handkerchief; more sightly is the umbrella of the latter than that of
gingham. Yet the Philosophy of Necessity reconciles us to the cheaper
article. It sweetens Geneva to lips longing for Champagne ; it commends
the Cuba to the mouth that waters for the Havanah.
Who would wear a pair of trousers three years?
obedient to the law of Necessity.
Necessity, in the garb of Seediness, may excite the ridicule of Beauty;
and the heart of the derided may, for a moment, be wrung: but Philo-
sophy whistles peace to it, in the shape of some popular air, and the pang,
ere one could articulate Jack Robinson, hath fled.
The Philosopher,
A Good Opening for Sir James.
At the Custom House things are passed without being opened ; at the
Post Office things are opened which should be held sacred. Let the officers
of the two establishments change places, giving SiR JAMEs GRAHAM the
control of the Customs, and then the business in each will be properly
transacted.
THE CITY OF LONDON DISFRANCHISED.
It seems that the entrance to the Victoria Tower of the new Houses of
Parliament is only just large enough to admit the royal carriage. If this
be true, by what entrance is MR. Pattison to get into the House !
THE ACTUAL LOCUS IN QUO.
WE understand that the next edition of Thomson's works will be embel.
lished with a view of the House of Commons, as the best illustration of
the “CASTLE of INDoleNCE.”

FIROM A GentleMAN To his FRIEND ON BEING CALLED TO THE AA v.

E-
MY DEAR ToM, -
I hope I am the first to con-
gratulate you. What a career is open
to you ! There is such loftiness of
purpose—such true nobility of aim in the profession to which with
a lover's fondness you have bound yourself—that in a measure I
feel myself glorified by the advancement of my friend I
You are now called to the bar ! Yes, you are of the happy few
chosen by the solemn election of the law as the privileged champions
of humanity. To you the widow and the orphan may prefer their
prayers; in you they are taught to look for an adviser and a bene-
factor. Injured lowliness may claim the bounty of your counsel,
and innocence betrayed demand the lightning of your words.
With these thoughts, what strengthening comfort must support
you through the paths of study still to be adventured 1 Feeling the
dignity of your mission, your mind will instinctively reject whatever
is mean and mercenary—will assimilate to itself all that is beautiful,
and pure, and good. In your hours of study you will feel that you
are arming yourself for the overthrow of craft, oppression, and all
the numerous brood of ignorance and ill : you will be sustained by
the thought, that you are dedicating the powers you have received
from Heaven to the noblest vindication of its grandest truth, justice
to all men. With this belief, you will labour rejoicingly: you will
dedicate your night to study, and the early lark will greet you at
your book.
It is, I know, averred that the study of law is dry and harsh—a
barren, thankless theme; that “the Books” have that within them
to weary the most patient spirit. And so, indeed, it may be to those
who as mere wordcatchers would study them ; who, incapable of
considering them in a philosophic light as operative on the social
mass, would seek their pages as Indians seek poison berries, only
for better means to slay their game with-But you, my dear friend,
have nobler aspirations; you contemplate law as the discreet and
virtuous daughter of Justice, and not as her Abigail.
When you look around and consider the various occupations of
men, how sweet must be your self-complacency 1 You cannot but
observe how thousands are doomed to a plodding obscurity; how
thousands pass from birth to death with no one action of their lives
to signalize themselves among their fellows: how, like corn, they
grow, ripen, and are cut down, leaving behind them no mark of their
past existence. Again, how many pass their days in acts of violence,
making life one scene of wrong and tumult; whilst others creep
and wind through the world, timorous and cunning, with little of
the majesty of man to glorify them. Forgetful of the greatness of
their mission as human creatures, they dwell within the small circle
of their selfishness, all things beyond mere things of fable.
How different is your lot You are “called to the bar:” you are
chosen to play a part before the eyes of the whole world. You
are to uplift your voice in defence of all that dignifies our nature:
you are to work the daily champion of the weak and the distressed.
ls it possible that man can have a more glorious vocation ? Is it
within the ambition of a truly virtuous mind to achieve greater
triumphs 1
Again, how beautiful will be the study of human nature laid before
Vol. VII.-1844.
you ! Every day you will be called to read that wondrous volume,
the human heart, in all its strange yet fascinating contradictions.
And when, in the fulness of fame, distinguished by every attribute
of moral goodness, you are summoned to the bench,-you will display
to the world one of its noblest spectacles, a great and good man
honoured for his worth. Your elevation, whilst it rewards the labours
of your own clear spirit, will, star-like, shine upon the hopes of
others, inciting them to act your worthiness again and again. Thus
will your excellence be multiplied, and example beget example.
Believe me, my dear Tom,
Your sincere friend,
Justus HARTLEy.
LETTER VIII.
REPLY OF THE GENTLEMAN CALLED TO THE BAR TO HIS FRIEND.
MY DEAR HART LEY,
You are, I find, the same enthusiastic, unsophisticated
creature that I left at Cambridge. May you never meet with aught
to change the noble simplicity of your nature I
True it is, I am “called ;” and most true I may, if I would wish
to starve, dub myself knight of all distressed matrons, virgins, and
orphans. Unfortunately, however, for your rhapsody, it will always
lie in the breast of the mother of accidents, whether I champion the
wronged or the wronger; whether I am to pour oil and honey into
wounds, or to be the humble instrument that adds another bruise :
whether, indeed, I fight on the side of Virtue, or lustily take arms
against her. This, however, is the accident of my fate; and so
that good retainers come in, I am content to bow to it. In your
noble philanthropy, Justus, please to consider the condition of the
world, if only what seemed virtuous and innocent were defended–.
if all who by the force of circumstance appeared knaves were left
to scramble for themselves. Look at the wrong committed under
this ignorant devotion to abstract right. Virtue making victims by
her very bigotry 1
As for the hours of study, they certainly bring their sweets; but
verily not after the fashion you, in your blithe ignorance, imagine.
Law, my dear fellow, is not a region of fairy to be searched for golden
fruits and amaranthine flowers; no, it is a deep, gloomy mine, to be
dug and dug, with the safety lamp of patience lighting us, through
many a winding passage—a lamp which, do what we will, so fre-
quently goes out, leaving us in darkness.
I grant you many of the high, ennobling privileges of the profes-
sion that your eloquence has dwelt upon ; but there are others which,
if you know not, permit me in the freedom of friendship to say, you
know nothing of the pleasures of the bar. Consider, what invulner-
able armour is a wig–a gown When they are once donned, you are
permitted, by the very defence you wear, to play with the characters
and feelings of men even as little girls play with dolls; ripping their
seams, blackening their faces, making sport with them in any way
for the prosperity of your cause, and the benefit of your client. By
virtue of your profession, you are emphatically a gentleman ; and
the very mode in which you are permitted to exercise your calling
proves you to be a slanderer for so much money. You are protected
by the Court, and, taking full advantage of your position, you may
say in the face of Justice that which a regard for your anatomy
would not permit you to utter even in a tavern. You are protected,
and may to your heart's full wish enjoy your abuse. You are pistol-
proof, and may therefore throw what mud and call what names you
please. You have the privilege of the bar, which in this case means
—the privilege of cowardice; and to the last letter you avail your-
self of its immunity.
You have likewise forgotten another privilege, that of cross-exa-
mination. Ha! my friend, you know my love of a joke, and truly I
anticipate much enjoyment from the freedom of tongue allowed me
when I shall have a witness to practise upon. How I will “torture
him with my wit”—how turn him inside out for the benefit of my
client 1 Indeed, the true heroism of the advocate is only shown by
his contempt of all things in honour of his fee. IIence, if retained
by homicide to wash white and, if possible, to sweeten the blood-
dyed ruffian for the world, I shall not hesitate (though assured of
my client's guilt) to blacken all the witnesses against him. In pur.
suit of this high duty, I shall think it onerous uſiou me to impug"

innocence, I may open the prison door to murder.

THE LUCIFERMATCH AND THE LUCIFER TONGUE.
At the Chelmsford assizes, a boy of nine years old, has been found
guilty of firing a barn. John Hanny, aged eleven, was also con-
victed of firing a stack of straw. At Huntingdon, SAMUEL. Baxter,
aged ten, was sentenced to fifteen years’ transportation for a like
crime. These offences are very dreadful—very. We are shocked
at the powers of mischief which the Lucifer match places in the
hands of the reckless and malignant. Terrible is it to contemplate
blazing stacks of hay, and straw, and wheat—most terrible to imagine
the savage satisfaction gleaming in the eyes of a starved, and there-
fore sullen and revengeful peasantry. However, the evil-doers are
caught, arraigned, and sentenced; and little would it avail them if,
in the dock, they were to make the most contrite, yea, abject apology
for their wickedness. The crime, they might declare, was accom-
THIRTY SECONDS''. ADVICE TO A CABMAN.
My Good Fellow, -
Your being a cab-driver is no reason why you should be dishonest
and impertinent, or even express yourself improperly; pray, therefore,
take these few words of advice as to your conduct and demeanour. ...,
When a gentleman hails you, do not cry out “Here you are, sir!
What you mean to say is, “Here I am, sir.” To tell a gentleman that h;
is where you are, is nonsense; unless, when he addresses you as * Cab 1
you mean to reply that he is another, and then it is impudent. Say,
simply, “Here, sir!” which is both concise and civil. - -
in soliciting for employment, pronounce the word, cab, according to its
orthography; that is, as it is spelt, c-a-b-cab, and not as if it were,
k-e-b-keb. Your brethren almost invariably cry, “Keb, sir!” “Keb,
sir 1" There is no such word askeb in the English language; you annoy
the correct ear exceedingly by using it; and besides, you set a bad
example, to youth, who learn to imitate the inaccuracy. . . .
Abstain, while on your stand, from flourishing your whip in the face of
everybody who passes you. By this gesture you often needlessly inter-
rupt a train of reflection, and discompose a philosopher.
When you are desired to drive to such a place, go there by the nearest
way. Endeavour to do your duty rather than your fare.
plished in an idle, reckless, or passionate moment; and therefore
they humbly begged pardon of judge, and jury, and of the directors
of the offices insuring the destroyed property, and so, having apolo-
gised, the culprits might trust that nothing more would be said of the
matter. Alas! such apology benefits not the incendiary with the
Lucifer match; he is not permitted to “explain,” but is inevitably
transported. -
How different the fate of the incendiary with the Lucifer Tongue!
He may idly, passionately, malignantly apply his combustible to the
character of any man; he may in the House of Commons—beneath
that awful roof where laws are made to restrain and punish the
vindictive and ferocious passions of men—he may there, in his place
and solemn function of statute-maker, cast fire about him, and
when caught in the fact, when become an object of most unenviable
attention—he may apologise for his inadvertence; he may declare
that he meant nothing; that he is very sorry if he have used his
Lucifer Tongue to the inconvenience of any gentleman, and there-
fore hopes that his accidental use of the brimstone will be looked
over. Great is the privilege allowed to the Lucifer Tongue, but
woe to the errings of the Lucifer Match Is it not so, good MR.
Wopesouse ! The Lucifer Tongue may “apologise,” and the
Lucifer Match is transported. -
A New Excitement.
Wr see by the papers that a “Thé dansante” was given a few days
ago by LADY YARDe Buller. A “Thé dansante”—or, in plain English,
a dancing Tea What an awful rattling of cups and saucers It must
have been almost as bad as our old friend, BARon Nathan, among the
new laid eggs at Tivoli.
We have heard of a leg of mutton and capers, but never did we hear
of café aur entrechats. This affair seems to have been a sort of Tea and
turr-out—the turning-out being applicable to the toes of the visitors.
LiterARY INTeLLIGENCE.
A work is, we understand, in preparation to be called The Calum-
ntator's Guide, or Every Man his own Apologist. It will contain copious
directions for backing out of slanderous assertions, and will be dedicated
to Ma. Wodehouse.
“ please, siR, is this the bank 1 "
“No, M’EM, this ERE's tunn'em green 1"
In making your charge, recollect that there are 1760 yards, not less, in
a mile ; and that miles are to be multiplied by eightpence, hot one shil-
ling. At all events, try whether you cannot, now and then, for once or
so in the way, receive your just due without grumbling for more, and
being abusive if it is not given you.
If it is not really too much trouble to you, mind, i little, where you are
driving. If you see a child or old woman in your way, you may as well
cry out before you run over them. Should they not hear you, you might
even slacken your pace a little. -
When any sort of property happens to have been left in your cab, it
will not be amiss, provided it is not exceedingly valuable, to take it to the
Hackney Coach Office, or to the place at which you set your fare down.
Honesty is not altogether ridiculous, and may sometimes prove worth as
much as a crown to you. -
These hints, my good fellow, are kindly meant by your possible fare,

tº SHAVING THE LADIES.”
ONE of the tricks, it seems, of the haberdashery trade, is a process de.
nominated “Shaving the Ladies;” but which would have been much
better termed, simply, imposing upon the ladies. This operation is per
formed by an assistant, and consists in persuading a lady to give some
three or four shillings more for an article than the price marked upon it.
We now see the reason why the sign of the Golden Fleece is suspended
in front of so many drapers' establishments.

THE SEVEN WISE MEN.
[A newly-discovered Tragedy of Æschylus, translated expressly for Punch.]
[This singular Drama is a real curiosity. Our researches, after six
months’ fag in the British Museum, have been totally fruitless in dis-
covering the period of ancient history to which it refers. The introduction
of the wise men of Greece affords no clue at all, for the functions and
fate of these persons in the Tragedy are so totally different from those
handed down from any other source, that a doubt rationally arises
whether they are in fact the “Wise Men of Greece,” commonly so called.
Some expressions, which seem of a modern character, have led to a
suspicion that the Tragedy is not really the work of AEschylus. This
suspicion must, however, immediately vanish, if due attention be paid
to the stern simplicity of the plot, which most unquestionably shows the
hand of the old tragedian, to say nothing of the affinity of treatment which
exists between this play and the Persa. In the translation liberties
have been taken with the lyric metres, but in the opening speech and
the speech of the spectre, the Iambic trimeters and Trochaic tetrameters
have been carefully preserved.]
Argument.
ARTAxerxes, tyrant of the Echinades, and a great patron of tragic art, offers the
writer of the best Tragedy his weight in gold, and appoints the seven Sages of Greece
arbiters to decide the merits of competitors. After fifty years they arrive at a decision,
but the Tragedy proves unsuccessful. ARTAxERxes, indignant, puts the seven Sages to
death, and then, in a fit of remorse, kills himself. The scene takes place in a portico,
where the seven Sages are resting from their labours.

The WISEST OF The WISE MEN.
Thus forty thousand tragedies have we read through,
And prayed to Bacchus, patron of the tragic art.
Long was our task and weary, but we now shall reap
The mighty praise which labour well bestowed deserves.
When we began to read we were but little boys,
But we went reading on till hair and beard grew white,
And now we look back on our tedious lengthy life,
And only see a vista of long tragedies.
To him that wrote the best of this tremendous lot,
Great ARTAxeRxEs hath allowed his weight in gold,
Appointing us to be the sapient arbiters.
We have decided after reading fifty years,
And now hard by the wondrous tragedy is played,
Of that bless'd wight who gained his weight in solid gold.
But hark, we hear the murmurings are gathering loud
Of that vile herd whose tragedies bestrew the earth.
CHORUS OF MALCONTENTS.
Até rides on wheels of fire,
Makes my arteries boil with ire;
Never again my proud head shall I rear,
Till my thirsty ears the glad news hear
That the tragedy is dammed.
Then will my heart be crammed
With joy transcendant, nigh as
Great as Apollo's when he played Marsyas.
I am neglected,
I am rejected,
Long I suspected
This was a do.
With my head crazing,
With my heart blazing,

Such a “row’’ you never heard, and much I hope you never will.
Some like snakes were hissing, while some others had a mighty cough :

yell'd “off, off "
ARTAxeRxes then came forward. To the countless mob he told
How he gave the man who made the Tragedy his weight in gold.
Then the mob roar'd more than ever, and a fellow strong and stout,

PUNCH, OR, TIIE LONDON CHARIVARI.
EARLY PARLIAMENTARY HOURS 1
GREAT MEETING OF MEMBERS.
N Thursday last a large meeting of Mein-
bers of Parliament was held at Exeter
Hall, for the purpose of considering
measures to ensure them—in common
with linen-drapers and others—the be-
nefit of short hours; that, like their
humbler fellow-subjects, they might
have the opportunity of improving their
minds.
MR. Brotherton, being unanimously
called to the chair, opened the business
in an eloquent and feeling address. It
had, he said, been his pride to struggle
against the system of late hours—a sys-
tem that had produced incalculable evils,
too evident in the speeches and conduct
of many members of the House of Com-
mons; who, worn out, by being com-
pelled to sit up for late divisions, were
morally and physically unable to culti-
vate their minds, or to know anything
of the real activities of life around them.
(Hear.) Such a system went to make a
Member of Parliament no other than
a mere voting-machine. (Cheers.) He,
therefore, trusted that such a blow
would that day be given to the system,
that Members of Parliament, like linen-
drapers' shopmen, would be allowed
some time to attend to their intellectual
requirements. At present, no set of men
demanded keener sympathy from the
public for their benighted condition.
(Hear, hear)
MR. Roebuck proposed the first reso-
lution. IIe then begged to express a
hope that no reporter was in the room ;
or if he were, that he would take no no-
tice whatever of his (MR. R.'s) speech,
as nothing gave him greater pain than
to see any of his speeches reported in
low-minded newspapers. The hon.
gentleman could give his testimony to
the evil of late hours. He had suffered
—deeply suffered from it. Worn out
and exhausted by late divisions, he had
been unable to cultivate that urbanity
of manner, and that charitableness of
feeling towards all men which—(here
the honourable gentleman was risibly affected)
—which he felt to be so beautiful in
theory, and desired to know something
of in practice. (Hear.) The hon. gentle-
man concluded by moving the first reso-
: lution.
MR. Won EHous E seconded the reso-
lution. He, too, had felt the hateful
influence of late hours. On a very
recent occasion he had entirely forgot-
ten himself; had talked he knew not
what ; made accusations in the dark,
and had, he feared, unconsciously played
the part of Snake in the School for Scandal. He could only account for
this misfortune by late parliamentary hours. They had, at times, so
bewildered him, that he found all his moral faculties in a fog. He
wished to cultivate his nobler part, but this was impossible, unless
the House of Commons shut up at a reasonable time of night. He
was convinced that the public knew very little of the prejudicial
effect on the intellects of Members of Parliament, by legislating, or
seeming to legislate-(Hear, hear)—after midnight.
Mn. D'Israeli moved the second resolution. It had caused him
the most painful emotions to witness the evil of late hours on the
great body of the House of Commons. How few of them—granting,
--—-S-
indeed, that they had the capacity—how few of them had the time
to cultivate their intellectual powers . How many sat, torpid as toads
in blocks of marble, until two or three in the morning, all their
ratiocinative powers blunted and destroyed by the dull, lengthened
routine of parliamentary debate. It was true there was one—an'
only one species of mind—namely, the Hebrew mind—that was able
to resist the numbing influence. The Hebrew mind was always wice
awake; and for that reason Young England (which he was ready to
prove was the lost tribe of Israel) would be the regenerative power
that would save England. Had not Sin Robert PEEL and Sik
JAMEs GRAHAM come of a Jewish stock—and this he (the speaker)
was prepared, in the twentieth edition of Coningsby, to testify, their
intellects, such as they were, could never have survived the wear
and tear of late Parliamentary hours. He hoped that the beneficent
spirit of the age, so much vaunted, would at least put Members of
Parliament on the same footing as the linen-drapers. At presen”
it was really dreadful to contemplate their ignorance. (Hear, hear.
Colon EL Sin Thorp was only too delighted to second the resolu-
tion. No member, better than he, could speak to the dreadful effect
of late hours upon the mind of a senator. He could honestly declare
it. Sometimes, after stopping till two or three in the morning, when
he gave his vote, he didn't know whether he stood upon his head or
his heels. (Hear.) Moreover, he was so jaded and worn out, that
ever since he had been in Parliament he had been unable to read
any book, pamphlet, or newspaper soever; that, in fact, he might
compare himself to a squirrel in a cage—(Loud Cheers)—that went
round and round, while all other squirrels were going on. He was
convinced that many Members of Parliament, according to BARoN
ALDERson, “kept company with blackguards,” only, as he (Col.
SIBThorp) thought, because they knew no better; because the late
hours of the House of Commons had only left them blackguardisin
for strong excitement.
Other resolutions were carried, and other eloquent speeches
delivered; but we have only room to state that, thanks having been
returned to the Chairman, the Meeting broke up, determined to use
all legitimate influence to compel the IHouse of Commons to shut up
at twelve every night, that the Members might have sufficient time
allowed them where with to educate their minds.
TOM THUMB AS HE WILL APPEAR AT PARIS.
THE RE rar at of WEllingtoN AT WAtr Ri oo.
As it is the intention of M. BARNUM to visit Paris with ToM THUMP,
he in the handsomest manner invited Punch to have a private view of the
General in the costume in which he will exhibit to our lively neighbours.
The GENERAL, having worn out Napoleon in England, he will there, in
olite deference to French prejudice, appear as the Duke of WELLINGTON.
he decided style in which the GENERAL wears his hat is in the finest
inlitation of the noble Duke—whilst his management of the double eye-glass
is perfection. He will besides, for the especial delight of the Parisians,
dance a hornpipe after the manner of his GRAce, and, moreover, sing a
comic song on the Reform Bill. When the GENERAL returns to America
he will, we understand, enchant Jonathan by appearing as PRINCE ALBERR.
HEAVY AFFLICTION.
The Paupers in Union Workhouses complain sadly of a feeling of
“oppression after eating”—their gruel. This, however, we imagine, is
the oppression of the Poor Law Guardians.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE FOURTH.-OF FREEHOLD ESTATES OF INHERITANCE.
Before we go any further we mean to consider an estate—but we shall
be very brief, though an estate is just the sort of thing we should like to
dwell upon.
A freehold estate of inheritance is either a fee simple or a fee tail, and
estates are probably called fees, because the lawyers generally contrived to
pay themselves pretty well out of them.
The true meaning of the word fee is the same as feud—a feud signify-
ing a row, because fees, which arise from law proceedings, are the result
of a squabble.
A fee simple is an estate that a man may leave to whom he pleases;
and it is, perhaps, called fee simple because it is sometimes very simply
or foolishly disposed of. “Hence the tenant,” says Bracton, “makes
good his own title to be called a simpleton.”
It used to be thought that a fee or freehold might remain in abeyance—
that is to say, without an owner—but modern lawyers cannot tolerate
the idea of a fee with nobody to take it, and the doctrine is therefore
exploded.
We must now consider a limited fee, which we must take care not to
confound with a half-guinea motion, which is a very limited fee indeed—
but is not an estate of inheritance, because one's heirs are not likely to
see much of it. These limited fees are divided into fees base or qualified,
and fees conditional.
Base fees are fees with a qualification subjoined, though, by-the-by,
a barrister who takes a base fee, or, in other words, receives less than is
marked on his brief, has seldom any qualification at all, either as an advo-
cate or a gentleman.
It is a base or qualified fee, if an estate were granted to A and his
heirs, beadles of the Burlington Arcade; for if any of the heirs of A
should cease to be beadles of that Arcade, the grant is entirely defeated.
A conditional fee is perhaps the lowest of all fees in its ordinary sense;
for when a barrister agrees to receive a fee conditionally on winning his
cause, it is a conditional fee that he bargains for. A person seised in
such a fee, or caught at such a trick, would deserve to suffer in tail by a
general endorsement, without limitation or restriction of any kind. An
estate held by a conditional fee is when it is granted to B and his heirs
male: so that if he has only daughters, they cannot have the estate.
When an estate is granted to a man and his heirs, he has what is
called a fee tail, from the French word tailler, to cut, because his heirs
must eventually cut him out, or because he may in some cases cut off
his own tail, by cutting away the rights of those who come after him.
Tail general is where an estate is given to a man and all his heirs
whoever they may be, which is a sort of tag-rag and bob-tail; but
where the gift is restrained to certain heirs, the estate is tied up—like
the head of a Chinese Mandarin—in a special tail.
Among the incidents of a tenancy in tail, are—first, the right of the
tenant in tail to commit waste by felling timber, breaking windows, and
other similar acts of mischief, which, if tenant in tail were a troublesome
young scamp, he would most probably like to be guilty of. The Marquis,
who rode his horse into the drawing-room of a furnished house he had
taken for the season was guilty of waste, because he was not seised in
tail, though his horse might have been.
Estates tail could not at one time be aliened at all, but it is now quite
settled that a man may cut off his own tail under a recent statute which
abolished fines and recoveries; for, although the law always delighted
in fines, it never favoured recoveries—for an estate in the hands of the
law is generally considered to be past recovery.
CORRESPONDEN C E BETWEEN ET ON AND
WESTMINSTER.
THESE two great nurseries for British statesmen have been corre-
sponding, through two of their senior pupils, on the glorious subject of a
rowing match. Westminster writes a tolerably business-like note, but
Eton soars far, very far, above the trammels of LINDLEY MURRAY. It is
true that public schools teach only Latin and Greek, which may account
for the fact that Eton cannot write English.
We give, from recollection, a specimen of the style of Eton, and we
beg the public to bear in mind that a lot of Eton boys are the chief cha-
racters in MR. D'Israeli's Young England Novel of Coningsby. West-
minster having written to enquire whether Eton will enter into a rowing
match, Eton, in the name of one of its scholars, thus replies to West-
minster :—
“Dear Sir-I don't know what you mean to say, when I read your
letter, which I think very absurd. I don't suppose you wrote what you
have said in your note, because the match, in . way you propose, is a
very strange manner of doing things, which all who have seen it say they
because, then, if you do, I shall be able to understand it better than if
ou did, which I must say I do not, nor do I see very well how you could
ve thought how that I ever could. At present
“Believe me, dear Sir, yours very truly,
* ETON.
To the above communication Westminster pithily replied that he
retracted nothing, and would publish everything. Considering that Eton
gives so many members to the Senate, can we be surprised at the
wretched manner in which those who speak in Parliament are often found
to express themselves It is to be regretted that Sik JAMEs GRAHAM did
not on this occasion practise his letter-opening propensities, for if he had
intercepted the Eton portion of the correspondence, he might have saved
the credit of the college. We should suggest that every Eton grammar
º have stitched on to the end of it a copy of the Complete Letter
riter.
CROCODILE TEARS"
Lord Bnough AM having, for the session, defeated Lord Cot-
TENHAM's Bill for the Abolition of Imprisonment for Debt, has
suddenly become very anxious—very anxious indeed—for the
passing of a new Insolvent Bill, that just tinkers the evil. There
are, it appears by a recent return, 3,352 imprisoned debtors ;
of these, 810 are for debts under one pound; under five, 794; and so
forth. One man has worn out 32 years in the Queen's Bench
Well, his Lordship hears of this report, and then declares that the
account of suffering “makes his hair stand on end I " He, however,
presses on the Bill, as “at this period of the session, the delay of every
day increased the risk of entire failure.” Why, the man knows
that, but for his meddlesome interference with Lond CoTT ENHAM's
Bill, that Bill might by this time have been an Act. But no;
it was too much for Lord Brough AM, that any large measure
should be passed without him. Therefore, he threw it over, and
then whimpers about the existence of an evil, which, but for him,
would have been remedied. For ourselves, we have no faith in
these crocodile whinings. If the Bill do not pass this session, then
may there be inscribed on the gateway of every debtor’sgaol—“Here

THE RAILWAY TELEGRAPH.
the papers, the other day, the public will have observed an
account of the application of the Electro-Magnetic
Telegraph to the Great Western Railway, by which
messages are sent up and down the line with
extraordinary rapidity. The readers of Punch
will be delighted to hear that the telegraph has
been attached to the “Wormwood Scrubbs, Ken-
2 sington, Warwick Square, Paddington Canal,
Shepherd's Bush, Little Western, and No June-
tion Railway,” which connects the two-and-a-half
milestone with a field in the Western suburbs.
The telegraph has been constantly in full play—
it is all play and no work on this secluded little
line—since Thursday. We give a specimen of the messages:—

THE MARQUIS OF LONDONDERRY's PITMEN
To THE MARQUIS OF LONDONDERRY.
The RE has been a great turn-out of the MARquis of Londox-
DERay's Pitmen, for which incident—deny it as he may—we have
|little doubt that the Marquis is uncommonly grateful. And for this
reason: It affords him an opportunity for the exercise of his literary
powers; and that the Marquis is smitten with the fatal charms of
pen and ink and foolscap, who that has read the noble writer's His-
tories and Travels, can deny Hence, the Marquis has, from Holder-
ness House, sent to his Pitmen several epistles full of “really paternal
advice " The result of this is, the following answer from the
pitmen to their anxious father, London DERRY.
“Durham, July 22.
“Marquis, We have received your letter that calls upon us “to leave
the Union and return to our work.” In answer to this we say—‘Oh, Mar-
quis' leave you your union, that coals may be cheaper, and the pitmen's
labour more abundant.”
“You charge us with combining. We, Marquis, charge you with the
like act. We combine with one another, that we may have the value of
the sweat of our brows; you belong to the Coal Trade Union—to the
Union of Masters, banded together to keep up the price of coals: to stint
the supply of the market, that it may always bring a certain price. What,
then, wealth may combine—but labour, not

keeping-book. The result is a
balance in your favour, “unbe-
known,” to speak popularly, to
your husband; which you quietly
invest in the bonnet. The success
of this little experiment depends
upon having a confiding husband
who never inquires about prices.
—N. B. It will also help towards
“making a purse.”
3. How to get credit for a
Country Residence.—Shut all
your lower shutters during Au-
gust and September, and live at
the top of the house. Take this
opportunity of wearing out your
old clothes.
4. To perpetuate Youth : —
Important to Matrons.—Having
grown-up daughters, of sixteen,
and pretty, dress them in frocks,
inafores, and frilled trousers.
}. them to play with
skipping-ropes, battledores, and shuttlecocks, and let them come in after
dinner to have half a glass of wine. Or send them somewhere away to
school, till people begin to say that you are treating them shamefully.
By this means an inference as to their age, and consequently as to yours;
will be precluded. For your own part, wear no caps; lace tightly, and
if your cheeks should have lost somewhat of the bloom of youth, buy
a little. You may thus remain stationary for a long time at eight-and-
twenty.
5. #, multiply Sherry—Take of old Brown. Sherry one bottle ; of
Ruisin, two ; of White Currant, three. Mix. This will make an excel-
lent Pale Sherry for supper at evening parties; but you had better not
introduce it at dinner.
6. Arioms.-Flannel for the fire-side; silk, satin, and velvet, for the
soirée.
7. Pudding first and Meat afterwards for little Girls and Boys:-To
cloy is to moderate the youthful appetite. Fat mutton goes far with the
young consumer.
8. Scraps on six days; a dinner party on the seventh. - -
9. Wax, damask, Brussels, magnificence, and profusion, one evening in
the year; dips, dimity, drugget, seediness, and parsimony all the
rest of it.
10. Pinch the stomach ; pamper the back. -

any family with a hint as to “making it out,” he will be delighted.

(From our own Astronomer.)
EveR having seen a Comet, and being most
desirous of getting every possibleinformation
about this particular one, I took an early
breakfast and commenced my observations
with the naked eye. A sort of fluid smoke
for some time interrupted a clear view of
the sky, and I had recourse to my spec-
tacles, which gave me very little assistance.
Having read the Times, in which I found
Professor South's report stating that he
had “seen the comet for the fraction of a
second, but could make no observation of
it,” I thought that, with great mental
energy, I might eventually, succeed in
doing nearly as much, and thus be in a
position to divide the laurel with that very great astronomer. Accord-
ingly, after dinner I sat down with a bottle of wine before me. and my
eyeglass in my hand, determined to watch for the come; Having been
unsuccessful for the first hour, I opened a second bottle of wine, and
eventually a third, which I had got about half-through, when the dazzled
state of my vision induced me to come to the conclusion that, like the
celebrated South, I had seen the comet. Such was my state of happy
ecstacy, that I remember nothing more, and I have great pleasure in
confirming the report of the great astronomer that no observation could
be made of the Čomet. Indeed I could make nothing. of it at all, but
I shall co-operate with the renowned South, in keeping my eye still
upon it.

CAPTAIN WARNER'S DISCOVERY.
WE have received the following report of the proceedings the other day
...t Brighton from Lord Bhough AM. We are obliged to his Lordship for
his prompt attention, but had rather that his style of addressing us had
leen a little less familiar. We have an objection to liberties being taken
with us, but we must, we suppose, allow much for that love of freedom
which has always been one of the salient points of Lord BRough AM's
character.
“Brighton, July 20, 1844.
“DEAR PUNCH,-I believe you know my opinion of the invisible shell.
I thought it a piece of humbug, and, hating all humbug—perhaps on the
principle of two of a trade never agreeing—I came down, determined to
blow up CAPTAIN WARNER, if he did not blow up a vessel, according to the
pledge he had given to the public.
“Having reached Brighton, I took up my station on the battery, and
amused myself by lying at full length on the wall, making my white hat a
support for my telescope, and reporting to the people round me the
result of my observations. Two was the hour fixed for the experiment.
Two came, but no blowing up. Humbugs are never punctual. They
never keep their appointments, though, by-the-by, if I could get a good
appointment now, I think I should keep it.
“I, of course, got rather impatient, and spoke my mind pretty freely.
They told me it took time to bring the ship up to her moorings. Pooh
All humbug, my dear Punch. As if they could not have hoisted her gaff,
put her mizen in the wind, and let her luff on the larboard tack till she
got athwart the bows of the steamer. I said as much to the by-standers,
who agreed with me, with the exception of a meddling fellow of a naval
officer, who was of course in WARNER's pay, and put there to puff up the
invention. I offered to go myself and bring her up, if they would allow
me. I also offered to go and remain in the vessel, while Warner tried to
blow it up—so certain was I that the whole affair was a hoax; but even
this they would not agree to. At last, tired out by importunities, without
which †. people would have seen nothing at all—for it was only mystick-
ing to the thing as I did that got WARNER to make the attempt—a noise
was heard, the vessel went away, and the thing ended in smoke, as I
The ship turned right over, so that daylight was

visible by the aperture in her timbers, and I saw through it of course
immediately.
“The ship sunk, true enough ; but, my dear Punch, I'll just tell you how
the thing was done. It was either done by a rope, or else by something that
floated up to the ship which pulled a trigger—that would be easy enough of
course—or an electric battery, or an air-gun, or a quantity of gunpowder
made to act by Kyan's process from the bottom of the sea, or a submarine
shell—or something or other. At all events it's a mere trick, and being a
trick, anybody could do it. I could, at all events, if the proper materials
were supplied to me. If you mean, my dear PUNch, to assume a sort of
scientific air upon the subject, put in the following paragraph, which I
should have put into the Penny Cyclopaedia, if the work had not been com-
pleted :- There is no doubt that all submarine salts acting in coalition
with a pure phosphate, and coagulating chemically with the sublimate of
marine potash, will create combustion in nitrous bodies. It is a fact in
physics that sulphurous acids held in solution by glutinous compounds
will create igneous action in aquiferous bodies, and therefore the pure
carbonate of any given quantity of bituminous or ligneous solids, will of
themselves create such a result as that which CAPTAIN WARNER produced
on Saturday by his alleged discovery. It will, therefore, be seen that we
gain no new fact—that there is, in reality, nothing done—and that the
whole is rather a semi-optical delusion than a great truth in science."
“There, my dear Punch, print that, and you will gain the credit of
knowing something about everything. That's the way I got my reputa-
tion for all kinds of useful knowledge.
“Ever, my dear Punch,
“Your devoted friend,
“BRough AM.”
We need hardly add that we do not quite agree with our noble and
!earned correspondent's criticism and conclusion on the discovery of
CAPTAIN WARNER.
PUNCH'S POLITICAL LEADER.
The public has lately been startled by an extraordinary glut of pine-
apples, and it has been found impossible to turn either to the right or to
the left without being, as it were, stared out of countenance by this salu-
brious luxury. Everybody is asking what can be the meaning of such a
sudden influx of this hitherto almost unattainable delicacy. Pines are
now thrust under our very noses, and ticketed at the most tempting
figures, so that every man may sport his pine-apple on Sunday, for dessert,
as reasonably as he could luxuriate in his threepenny pottle of hautboys.
Superficial observers see nothing in all this but a fall in the luscious fruit
we have alluded to. We, however, take a deeper view of the subject, and
look apon these pine-apples as the legitimate fruits of the tariff. The
insane and selfish policy which, for a long time, crippled currants, and
kept figs at a feverish price ; which prevented the Brazilians from a
friendly interchange of their nuts for our manufactures; which debarred
the merry sons of Naples from sending us their maccaroni, and taking
our Birmingham cutlery in return ; this insane and selfish policy no
longer prevails, and we may hope that SIR. Robert PEEL will, ere long,
give us a cheap loaf, since he has ventured on the experiment of giving
us a cheap pine-apple. We trust that the cry of “pine-apples for the
people” will henceforth be the watchword of free-trade; and it is very
possible that “melons for the million” will hereafter find an echo in the
policy of future governments.
TO M.P.'s ON THE USE OF A GUN.
of the Honourable Gentlemen, the
business of I.egislation
having been concluded,
will shortly be off to
the Moors. Punch
has sometimes had oc-
casion to give them
advice as to their con-
duct in the Senate, and
he now begs to offer
them a few friendly hints with regard to their behaviour in the field.
In the first place, he would express the hope that honourable gentlemen
will not, in the latter situation, hang fire quite so much as they are in the
habit of doing in the former. He trusts, also, that they will now be on
their legs from morning till night to somewhat more purpose than they
have so been from night to morning ; that the grouse they will bag will
be proportionate to the time they have killed, and that they will make &
great many more hits in the Season than they have succeeded in making
during the Session.
He begs to call their particular attention to their priming and loading,
matters which, judging from their senatorial proceedings, he fears they
may incautiously overlook. Their speeches on various subjects have
showed many of them to be very indifferently primed : should this be the
| case with their guns, the latter will go off like their orations, that is to
say, not at all.
IIe would recommend them to direct their guns in a way just the
reverse to that in which they direct their remarks; namely, towards the
grouse, or object in view ; not against each other. For honourable
gentlemen are to remember, that, though words break no bones, the
same is not predicable of No. 4; and that, should they, by accident,
shoot other honourable gentlemen through the head, however opinions
may differ as to the amount of mischief which in some cases will be done,
such mischief will be irremediable by apology.
Lastly, he would suggest to them that the Moors are the place for
shooting, not for talking about it; but perhaps this admonition is unneces-
sary ; for fowling is one thing, and law-making another ; and honourable
gentlemen, he has reason to believe, are never more in earnest thrº when
they are in sport.
THE SCALES OF JUSTICE—COTTINGHAM WEIGHT.
Willi Axi Wilson, a Merton omnibus driver, is charged at Union
Hall, before Mr. Cott INGHAM, with a gross assault on a lady named
Mu R RELL. He is fined 3l. and costs l—Immediately paid.
HENRY SHEPHERD of a Carshalton omnibus, on the same day and
before the same magistrate, is charged with furious driving; and is
—committed for a month to hard labour.
Next comes, before the same magistrate, John LINton, a butcher
of the Waterloo Road, who enters a man's house, and commences a
criminal assault on a modest married woman, “using the most dis-
gusting language.” Mr. Cotti Ngh AM expressed his surprise, that the
woman's husband did not “criminally indict the man;” and then, as
a wind-up to such astonishment, inflicts a 5l. fine upon the offender;
which, of course, is—Immediately paid.
Thus, you may strike a woman (as it was proved Wilson did) a
severe blow on the bosom, and the charge for the same is 3.

dodging Johnvill just as I used to dodge the pages and housemaids in
Buckingham Palace. The day before yesterday he comes here, and starts
next morning to Tangier (just off where I tumbled overboard), and comes
back again at night to take his mess with the Governor, old SIR Robert
WILson. SIR Bobby never had the civility to ask me, but that made no
difference. I quietly dropped myself overboard, got ashore, and down the
chimney into the Governor's house. All dinner-time I stowed myself
in an empty wine-cooler, and saw and heard everything. Master John-
vill—a sly-looking chap that, uncle—palavered it very well. They
drank his health ; and then he got up and drank England's health and
Vic's health, (bless the little lady how is she t) and said he hoped that
the English lion and the Gallic cock would play with one another till the
world's end ; that he loved England very much, indeed, and wouldn't mind
spending all his days in an English three-decker, he'd such a taking for
that sort of thing. When he said this, I could see that some of our blue-
jackets winked at one another, just as much as to say, I wish you may

his hands upon his bosom, and taking the other to stroke down his tip (that
hangs from his chin for all the world like a swab of horsehair), he said
that if he had written the book, he didn't mean anything in it. He said
that nobody prayed against war more than he did ; that nobody loved the
English so much as he did ; that he'd rather die than hurt a hair in the
British Lion's tail, and a good deal more flummery of the sort, without
blushing a bit more than a figure-head. . And then he tossed off his grog
to the glory of the British navy; and then I saw our blue-jackets wink
at one another again, and so the toasting ended.
“When the PRINCE went away he embraced the Governor, giving him
such a hug that all the blood in his body flew into his face—and then the
PRINCE embraced the Captains, and then the Lieutenants, and I did
think he was going on with the Midshipmen, but he brought himself up
with a round turn, and then with a low bow, sheered off. This is all I
can write to you at present. However, if anything else happens, you shall

at last to throw it overboard. If you write anything more, don't send it
to me, for the Captain swears 'twill waterlog the vessel.

Sir Robert PEEL grants Mr. Duncombe a committee to inquire into
the iniquities practised at the Post-office, but will not suffer Mr. DuN-

1NTEREST FOR A PLACE,
HoNou RED SIR,
According to my promise, when I last had the pleasure of
shaking your worthy and high-minded hand, I take up my pen to
let you know how matters go on in our borough of Pottlepot. Oh,
sir! the Blues are done for ever ! They ought, if they had any
sense of their littleness, to crawl upon all fours the rest of their
natural lives: it’s downright impudence of 'em to think of walking
upright on two legs, like incorruptible, independent voters. But, sir,
they are done for ever ! As I said at the club on Saturday, where
we always drink your honoured health standing with nine times
nine, as I said, after we had toasted your patriotism and all your
public and private virtues, SIR. Curtius Tu RNst ILE, says I, sits for
Pottlepot for life; it's as good as his own freehold. And so it is,
sir. Be sure of it, there isn't a Yellow that wouldn't die for you,
with all their wives and families included. You have touched their
hearts, SIR. CURTIUs, in the proper way, and there isn't a man
that wouldn't bleed for you in return. And then for the women;
why, I'm a sinner, if last Sunday there weren't six babies every
one of 'em christened CURT1 us. There they were, sir—bless the
little cherubs —with yellow ribands in their caps, and ribands hung
all over them, and their mothers and fathers smiling on the colours
with all a parent's fondness. Ha, sir! it would have done your noble
heart good to hear how the same night we drank the healths of the

pendent voters of Pottlepot.
But how, sir, should it be otherwise Who can forget your kind-
ness when you came among us to canvass : What condescension—
what liberality There's poor MRs. Spaiggs, the good soul who
sells cakes; she never speaks of you without tears in her eyes; and
as for her husband—a rascally Blue !—whom the kind creature made
so drunk, and then shut the shutters on the day of poll, that when
he woke he thought it was still night, and so went to sleep again,_
dear Mrs. Spaiggs, says she can't enough bless you. Though
you bought her jackdaw for ten pounds, she's got another; and for
all her husband—like a brutal Blue as he is l—beats her once a week

You'll be glad to hear, Sin Curtius, that little Bobby Windfall,
the bellows-mender's child, has got over the small-pox, and won't be
very much marked. I’m sure you’ll be glad of this, from the kind
manner with which I saw you kiss the suffering babe when it was so
very bad indeed.
The organ that you sent down to the chapel plays very beautifully
—very It quite melts the heart of every true Yellow to listen to
it. But I am sorry to say—I blush for my species while I write it—
that several stiff-necked Blues stay away from chapel because of that
organ : whilst one of 'em, with a sneer that meant I know not what,
said, “The organ was a most appropriate gift from you, as no sinner
could listen to it without thinking of corruption.” What he meant
by this 'twould puzzle me to discover.
Your kind hospitality in inviting all of us to your mansion in town
whenever we should come to London, will in a few days be rewarded.

you'll not let BRADs stir in London without you’re by his side; she

welcome to keep her husband for a month; only when he comes
back, she says she shall expect to see what sort of caps they wear
in London.
We are all on the look out for your first speech, as you promised
us on the hustings that it should be a teazer.

HAMPDEN BRick.
P.S.—I had almost forgotten to say, that my son Bautus—the
youth to whom you jokingly gave a five-pound note to light a cigar
with—is now anxious to enter upon the world. Forgive the feelings
of a father; but please to write by return of post whether his place
will be in the Excise, the Customs, or the Treasury. I suppose we

LETTER X.
ANSWER OF SIR CURTIUS TURNSTILE, M.P., TO HIS CONSTITUENT,
HAMPDEN BRICK.
MY DEAR SIR,
It gives me the deepest pleasure to learn the happiness
and tranquillity of the favoured borough of Pottlepot. Bound up as
my future public life is with the sympathies of the noble-minded and
incorruptible men by whose votes I hold my present exalted situa-
tion—my present enviable prominence in the eye of the world—
it must be to me a vital felicity to know of their felicity. As for
the Blues—that desperate faction—that band of little Neros preying
on the vitals of their mother-country but I dismiss them from my
thoughts. Contempt relieves me from the excess of indignation.
It is to me a deep happiness to find that I am remembered at your
hebdomadal meetings at the Angel. Believe me that every Saturday
night I shall spiritually return thanks for the honour that you do me.
The thought that I have awakened a feeling of respect in the
bosoms of my fair well-wishers and active supporters of Pottlepot,
awards to me the proudest moment of my life. That, with a delicacy
which peculiarly distinguishes the disinterested excellence of their sex
from the too frequent selfishness of ours, they should give my name
to the pledges of their hallowed love, produces feelings in my breast
much more easily conceived than described. Tell them from me,
good MR. BRick, that whilst they have complimented me, they have
imposed a task upon me—yes, sir, a task; for, henceforth, it must be
the peculiar study of life to do nothing that shall be in the least
unworthy of my interesting namesakes. It would, I assure you,
have given me great pleasure to be their godfather, but—another
time.
I am delighted to learn that the excellent MRs. Spriggs is in
good health. Though decidedly not a woman of high education, she
has that instinctive patriotism which made the glory of the ancient
matron. She might, without a blush, call the mother of the GRAcchi
sister. I am more than amused to hear of her jackdaw ; and, for
her sake, hope for better things from her husband.
Believe me, you only do justice to my feelings when you say that
I shall be happy to hear of the recovery of Master Robert Winn-
Fall. Though asleep, and in a sad condition when I saw him, I do
think I never looked upon a more intelligent child. I trust he will
become a blessing to his parents, and an honour to the ancient
mystery of bellows-mending.
What you tell me respecting the organ, shocks me. That the
spirit of party can, in such a subject, find matter for its bitterness,
makes one almost despair of human nature. Alas! alas ! that even
the humble present of a church organ cannot escape the ribaldry of
party malice. But nothing, sacred or profane, does escape it !
You speak of a projected visit to town by Chors, BRAps, and
STRoNG-1'-TH'-ARM, my worthy and indefatigable constituents.
There are no men for whose honesty—whose singleness of purpose
—whose primitive simplicity of character—I have a higher admira-
tion ; but was there ever anything so unfortunate At present my
mansion is undergoing a thorough repair; filled with carpenters,
bricklayers, plasterers—in fact, turned inside out. Hence, to my
inexpressible annoyance, I shall not have the pleasure of seeing
them under my own roof; and what is worse, I fear—I say, I fear-
that unavoidable business will, for a week at least, take ºne from
No. 160.

I have not yet spoken in the House. It is my policy never to
throw away powder. But when I do make myself heard, depend upon
it that Pottlepot will hear the report.
Believeme, my dear Sir,
Yours faithfully ever,
Cuatius TuRNstile.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH SUDBURY:
(From our Hampshire Correspondent.)
Sudbury is disfranchised. Yes, it is blotted out from the political map:
and the question now arises, What is to be done with the vacant fran-
chise? It is rumoured that there will be a new metropolitan borough,
effected by the conglomeration of Chelsea, Kensington, and Hammersmith.
Chelsea has her Piers, and why should she not have her Commons?
Kensington has her railway, and why not her rights? Hammersmith has
her Chain bridge, and why should she not form a Link in the constitution?
Echo answers, “Why should she not?” while Common Sense whispers,
* Certainly.”
But, then, it may be asked, why should one of the suburbs be favoured
to the prejudice of its fellow-outskirts? Is Kensington alone capable of
freedom, and can Putney never know the pride of a patriot + Shall there
be an honourable member for Chelsea, while Peckham pines in unrepre-
sented hopelessness? Fulham has her feelings, and the heart-burnings of
Hackney are proverbial; while the blood of Brixton boils for the enjoy-
ment of that political position which has been hitherto denied to her.
The proud population of Pentonville are maturally jealous of any conces-
sion to a rival suburb; and, though we do not apprehend the horrors of
civil war, we should be sorry to see Islington ranged in deadly hostility to
Chelsea, between whom civilisation, and an omnibus every ten minutes,
have contributed to establish a most amicable understanding.
But, in the words of the French politician, mous verrons, or, as BLAG-
pen would express it in his Interpreter, “We shall see”—if we do but
keep our eyes open.
-
THE LAW OF ARREST.
We understand that, if there should be any alteration in the Law of
Debtor and Creditor, involving the abolition of Imprisonment, the trustees
of Staples Inn will claim compensation, on the ground of their chambers
being greatly reduced in value, through the operation of the measure.
It is not perhaps generally known, that the range of buildings on the south
side is situated partly in London and partly in Middlesex; so that a
debtor in bed has only to draw up his legs into the county at the approach
of a city bailiff, or dive down under the bed-clothes into London, if a writ,
sued out in Middlesex, should be shown to him.
This freedom from arrest is very ancient; for, while the person living
in ALPRED's time was safe in the precincts of the palace, there is a case in
the Books, as old as Egbert, where there appears to have been a privilege
of palliasse, and a rejoinder of Nul tiel Bedstead was declared on ...
to be bad for uncertainty. In another case, Respondeat ouster was resorted
to by ousting the respondent, or kicking him out of bed, which led to a
replication De injuria; but as no bruise could be shown, it fell to the
ground for want of colour.

“Repudiation " is a Yankee no-
tion—so is slavery, so is Lynch law,
so is annexation, so is Mormonism,
so is chewing tobacco. But the
Yankee notion which we are about
to develop is the notion of a Yankee;
and if the reader does not own it to
be a considerable one, we are pretty
particularly mistaken.
All foreigners, whether counts
and barons, or fiddlers and dancing-
masters, are distinguished by pecu-
liarities of dress and person. This
assertion includes the Yankee, who
thus, though untitled, may be ranked
among distinguished foreigners.

knows, was a conjuror. The brim,
however, turns up more at thesides:
so that there is much less of the flat
about it than there is about the
Royal invention; a difference, per-
haps, depending on the different
minds of which respectively the two
hats were emanations.
In the second place, the Yankee

Thirdly, the Yankee is denoted by
his paiz,
in which lankness of feature may be
said to vie with sallowness of com-
plexion. The mouth, to speak with
mathematical precision, is curvi-
linear, like that of a steel purse:
his nose is as plain as that on your

by the tail of the rat.

GRAND BALLET POLITIQUE.
In PRePARATION AT her MAJESTY'S The ATRE.
We shall soon have to congratulate MR. LUMLEY on one of the most signal triumphs
of a triumphant season. The Grand Ballet now in preparation will be the occasion of
the débùt of a young and highly promising artiste, Signor D'IsrAELI, a dancer of the
pure Caucassian school, who comes to Her Majesty's Theatre with the strongest recom-
mendations from several distinguished parties, and whose eccentric Pas diplomatiques have
already excited the attention of the continental dilettanti.
We can, as yet, give, from hearsay, no more than a very
| slight sketch of the action ; which, however, if we mistake
not, will be enough to put our readers' expectation on tip-
toe. The ballet consists of two tableaux; and the scene opens
in the “Temple of PEEL,” said to be one of the chastest efforts of
the MessRs. GRIEves' pencil. Here at first all is harmony, and
the corps de ballet go through a pretty “Conservative Dance”
round the altar; towards the conclusion of which, however, some
five or six (the party of Young England) are observed to separate
from the rest, and engage in earnest pantomime : these dancers
(who are very becomingly dressed, with white neckcloths, trunk-
hose, and rosaries) are ãº by Signor D'Israeli, who is ex-
pected to make a very great sensation in the pas which follows.
The scene changes, and the Young Englanders proceed at once
to their “Pas de la Nouvelle Génération ;” in the course of which
curious and recherché dance (said to partake of the Coranto of
Elizabeth, with a soupron of the Anglo-Saxon jig), they thrice
approach DR. Pusey, who is seated near the footlights, attempting
to crown him with a cardinal's hat; which the Doctor as often
refuses with inimitable grace. At the end appear, first, MR. Miles
nnd some West Indians, who dance a “Pas de Differential
Duty,” with a determined air; followed closely by Lond John
Russell and the Whigs, who execute a very charming “Pas
d'Espérance,” and afterwards mingle with the rest: the first
tableau closing with a spirited .."; Dance, which represents an
encounter between the votaries of Peel and the opposing party;
who, by means of their increased numbers, come off victorious.
The chief feature of the second tableau is the “Pas Tartare et de
Screw-driver” by PEEL, which is highly original and forcible, SIR
| Robert advancing with menacing gesture, and brandishing the
instrument at the deserters. No sooner is this dance over, than
four of the latter break from the group, and commence a “Pas Pénitentiel,” which is
described as a species of Mazurka, all the four repeatedly coming down sur les maro-
bones in a deprecatory manner, and finally, on receiving a gracious nod in token of for-
giveness, falling gracefully into the ranks of the consistent votaries. The Tilting Dance
is then repeated, and this time (from the new change of numbers) with an opposite
result, ending in the complete victory of Peel. Young England
then performs a Polka of the times of Pharaoh, of a vindictive
character; and the curtain falls.
Besides those we have mentioned, there are interspersed throughout the ballet many
other very attractive pas; the gem of the piece, indeed, is said to be the “pas de
== º
- / / ! -
çhancellor's Pig,” by Loap BR9vgham (MADLLE. CERito) and Lond Lyndhurst (M. Sr.
Léon). In this pas, Csaito (who makes a very fascinating Broughº) executes
\
the most incredible bounds, tours de force, and rapid
and unaccountable gyrations; while St. Léon, hold-
ing the wig at arm's length, and appearing to offer it
with each hand alternately to the pretty claimant, always
playfully withdrawing it when it seems in the very grasp
of Lord BRough AM's fair representative. Another ver
striking feature is the “Pas de Post-office,” in whic
Signor Mazzini is observed reading a letter, over his
macaroni, when SIR JAMES GRAHAM (it is a pastout seul
º that artiste) advances noiselessly on tiptoe, and peeps
alternately over each shoulder at the contents. Altogether,
it apparently may be safely pronounced of the forthcom.

THE BRITISH PHARMACOPOEIA;
OR, FARMER'S FIRST LESSON IN CHEMISTRY.
A class has been formed at a place down in Hampshire
º Punch does not feel called upon to speak more expli-
citly)—for the study of Agricultural Chemistry. The plan
of instruction is catechetical. The following Lesson is
founded on the responses, as reported to Punch by his
own correspondent, delivered at one of its recent meet-
ings. Mistakes, they say, afford often a valuable lesson.
If so, it is hoped that the lesson subjoined will be of great
value:—
“Chemistry is keepun' a doctor's shop. An atom is
a mossel o' zummut; a bit o’ dust or zand, loike. The
weight of an atom is the heft on un. Light is accordun
as it med be : day-light, moon-light, or candle-light.
Heat is that are as comes out o' the vire.”
* [To the question, “What are the phenomena of heat 1"
the reply was, “Dooan't 'zactly know what you maues,
zur.”
“The effect of heat is, rooastun' mate, bilin' 'taaters :
burning your vingers if you gets too clooase to 't. Light-
ning is a thunderbolt fallin' out o' the clouds; a thunder-
bolt is a thing like a clinker. An acid is any sort o'
zour stuff, like vinegar or varjus. An alkali is a foreign-
eerun' name vor zummat or other, may be for a pig.
Potash is ashes from under a pot. Soda is stuff as washer.
women uses. Ammonia is one o’ them fine names as
your gentlefolks gives their daaters. If you puts zul-
phuric acid to lime, and makes zulphate o' lime, why, of
coorse, if you adds it to wuts (oats) you gets zulphate o'
wuts. A simple body means a zimpleton, like Zilly Billy
at the Poorus. The laws of Chemical Union is like the
laws of any other Union, pretty strictish, and o' coorse
every Chemical Union has got a Beadle. Chemical Affi-
nity, Attraction, Cohesion, Composition, Decomposition,
Analysis, Synthesis, is a parcel of outlandish gibberish.
Justus Liebig is zome Wrenchman.”
The foregoing statements, we imagine, exhibit some
slight discrepancy with the views of FARADAY ; but as the
agricultural mind expands, its ideas of chemical science
will very likely become rather more accurate.
Theatrical Intelligence.
The Busy Body is now being performed with great suc-
cess at two houses. Critics are at a loss to decide whose
Marplot is the finer bit of acting—LoRD BRough AM's, or
Charles MATThews's, but, after the astonishing way
in which Lord BRough AM has acted all through the
Imprisonment for Debt Bill, the superiority has been
awarded, most justly, we think, to his Lordship.

attacks, the FRANchise of Sudbury. Owing to internal
corruption, the FRANchise was obliged to undergo the
amputation of two of its members, which, mortification
having ensued, hastened its death. The pockets of 440
voters have been left to deplore the loss of the Franchise.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COUNSEL’S CODE OF HONOUR.
CoMMON Honour, like Common Honesty, is a thing which, on this side, at least of
the Atlantic, is generally understood. The attempt, therefore, to explain it, would
be either a superfluity, or an impertinence; sins which were never yet laid at the
door of Punch's Office.
The Bar is said to be an honourable profession. So different, however, is Forensic
Honour from Common Honour, that a frequent question in Society is—“What in
the name of goodness does it mean?”
Forensic Honour is a mass of opinion floating about the legal profession. Like the
Common, Law, it is an unwritten code. Its code shall be unwritten no longer.
Should the following—(Punch's)—be incomplete, there may be found a Queen's
Counsel, or, peradventure, a Bankruptcy Commissioner, to amplify it.
Article 1.-Of Clients.-The client is the person whose cause is to be pleaded.
He may be a knave, rogue, or villain of the blackest dye. Yet it is perfectly
honourable in a barrister, well knowing him to be such, to undertake his case for
hire; and to promote his object, whether fraud, extortion, oppression, or the
evasion of justice, to the utmost of his ability.
Art. 2.-Of BRIEFs—The brief contains the substance of the story to be told.
This may be true, false, or doubtful. Whether true, false, or doubtful, it is all one
to the counsel. He may doubt its truth, or have no doubt of its untruth. No matter.
He has to tell it, and try, as hard as he can, to make the Court believe it; and this
conduct is quite consistent with his honour.
Art. 3.-Qf Witnesses.—A witness is a person sworn by a solemn oath to speak
the truth. The barrister may honourably entrap him into speaking untruth. He
may confuse, intimidate, ºi. and bully him, as much as he likes, so as to force
him to say what he does not mean, or not say what he means. It is a mistake to
suppose that he thus draws the guilt of perjury on his own head.
Art. 4.—Of Juries.—Juries are sworn to decide according to the evidence.
Honour by no means forbids a counsel to make them falsify their oath; by inducing
them to decide according to their prejudices and passions.
Art. 5.-Of Pleading.—Pleading is the advocacy of a case by argument and
oratory. In argument a barrister may very honourably have recourse to sophistry;
in other words, to those verbal artifices which impose on unlearned and undiscerning

minds a wrong conclusion, in plain English, a falsity. As to oratory, he may affect
any sort of enthusiasm which he does not feel; and he may malign, asperse, and
ridicule, to any extent, the character, however pure and estimable, of his opponent's
client and witnesses.
Art:6–9F Honour Among BARRisters.-Notwithstanding that Common Honour,
even that which exists among thieves, prescribes mutual civility, it is allowable for
one barrister openly to accuse another, deservedly or not, of ignorance, meanness,
jº. and trickery; provided always, that he speaks of him as his “learned
Tiend.
Art. 7-SUMMARy of the Code.—The counsel may, with unsullied reputation, be
the conscious mouth-piece of the swindler, the seducer, the libeller, the extortioner,
the thief, the pickpocket, the murderer. He has a carte blanche for aiding, under
the name of agentleman, in the spoliation of the fatherless and the widow. He
may, for these noble ends, corrupt testimony, pervert judgment, traduce innocence,
deride worth, and call his neighbour all those names which, according to vulgar
notions of honour, he has thereby earned for himself: and all this he may do for a
consideration—unscouted, unkicked, unpumped upon.

POOR BLOWN-UP GENERALS
WITH the prophetic spirit which is the sole property of
Punch, he here with supplies his million of readers with
the long hoped-for result—very graphically put—of the
invention of CAPTAIN WARNER. Without waiting for
the opinion of Lord Brough AM upon the matter, Punch
confidently predicts, on the success of the invisible shell,
a terrible decline in the world's market of all gunpowder
heroes. The great god, MARs himself, will have nothing
left him but Basinghall Street: he must give up wholesale
carnage, and for an honest livelihood—if he have still a
weak hankering after combustibles—sell Lucifer matches.
As for BELLoNA, it will be well with her, if now and then
she can get a day's charing.
PUNch has had a dream, which “was not all a dream.”
The destructive power of the WARNER shell duly
acknowledged, he thought that all the cannon from Dept-
ford--all the shot—all swords and bayonets—in a word,
all the metal cast and hammered by Vulcan for the sport
of war, were put up for auction; mere waste iron, to be
turned into railways and steam-engines. PUNch in his
dream saw a very taking advertisement, drawn out in his
most unctuous style by GEon GE Robins, who “had re-
ceived orders from the Horse Guards to sell”—PUNch
knows not the number—of helmets, which GEong E, in his
prettiest manner, recommended to country wives and far-
mers as “exquisitely adapted for bee-hives.”
Hurrah, then, for the WARNER shell, from which—all
terrible as it is—peace may be hatched, to the true happi-
ness of man, and the best glory of nations !
LORD ELDON'S LOVE VERSES.
All the world knew Lord Eldon to be a great lawyer, but
no one was aware—until MR. HoRAce Twiss published the fact
—that the great ex-chancellor was a poet of no mean preten-
sions. His Lordship's lyrics to his Bessy contain all the
sweetness of SPENCER combined with the copiousness of Cokx
—all the melody of MooRE, with nearly all the precision of
PETERSDoRff. "We are happy in being able to furnish a
specimen.
LINES to BESSY.
My head is like a title-deed,
Or abstract of the same:
Wherein my Bessy thou may’st read,
Thine own long-cherished name.
Against thee I my suit have brought,
I am thy plaintiff lover,
And for the heart that thou hast caught,
An action lies—of trover.
Alas upon me every day,
The heaviest costs you levy:
Oh, give me back my heart—but nay ?
I #. I can't replevy.
I'll love thee with my latest breath,
Alas, I cannot you shun,
*Till the hard grasp of Sheriff death
Takes me in execution.
Say, Bessy dearest, if you will,
Accept me as a lover;
Must true affection file a bill
The secret to discover.
Is it my income's small amount
That leads to hesitation ?
Refer the question of account
To Cupid's arbitration.

I could not smoke—I was with three ladies in the fly—they were
all fat, and, oh! how hot . The sun beat down upon us ruthlessly.
CAPTAIN WARNER wouldn't come. We drove and put back the
dinner. Then Miss Bog LE said she would like to drive to the
Library for the last volume of GRANT's Visit to Paris.
While we were at Folthorpe's, their messenger came running
in—he had been out but one minute that day; he had seen it. We
had been out four hours; it was all over ! All that we could see when
we got back was this—

That was what I had come to Brighton for—to eat prawns for
breakfast—to pay five shillings for a warm bath—and not to see the
explosion 1
I set off for London the next day. One of my dinners was coming
off that day—I had resigned it. There would very likely be turtle;
and I wasn’t there ! Flesh and blood couldn’t stand it. “I will go
to Dover to-morrow,” I said, “and take the first packet that goes—
that goes anywhere.”
I am at Dover. This is written from the Ship Hotel : let me recol-
lect the adventures of the day.
The Dover trains go from two places at once : but my belief
is, the cabmen try and perplex you. If it is the turn of the
Bricklayers' Arms train, they persuade you to London Bridge, if of
the London Bridge, they inveigle you to the Bricklayers' Arms—
through that abominable suburb stretching away from Waterloo
Bridge, and into the Great London, which seems as it were run to
seed.
I passed a Theatre—these creatures have a theatre it appears—it
is called (to judge from a painted placard) the Victoria. It is a

morning—if you don't, I won't answer for the consequences.—You
look as white as a sheet—as puffy as a bolster—this season you've
grown so inordinately gross and fa’ ” ”
It’s a word I can't bear applied to myself. I wrote letters round
to decline my dinners ; and agreed to go—
But whither Why not to Brighton I went on the 18th July.

brick building, large, and with the windows cracked and stuffed with
coats.
At the Bricklayers' Arms, which we reached at length after paying
several base turnpikes, and struggling through a noisy, dirty, bustling,
dismal city of small houses and queer shops and gin palaces—the
policeman comes grinning up to the cab, and says, “No train from
here, sir, next train from London Bridge—hoften these mistakes.
Cab drove away only just this minute. You'll be in time if
you go.”
The cabman gallops off, with a grin. The brute! he knew it well
enough. He went for an extra fare.
As I do not wish to have a coup-de-soleil ; or to be blinded with
dust ; or to have my nerves shattered by the infernal screaming of
the engine as we rush howling through the tunnels: as I wish to sit
as soft as I can in this life, and find a board by no means so elastic as
a cushion, I take the first-class, of course—I should prefer having
some of the third-class people for company, though—I find them
generally less vulgar than their betters.
I selected, as may be imagined, an empty carriage : in which I
lived pretty comfortably until we got to Reigate, where two per-
sons with free tickets — engineers and Scotchmen —got into the
carriage.
Of course one insisted upon sitting down in the very seat opposite
me. There were four seats, but he must take that, on purpose to
mingle his legs with mine, and make me uncomfortable. I removed
to the next seat—the middle one. This was what the wretch wanted.
He plumped into my place. He had the two places by the window—
the two best in the coach—he leered over my shoulder at his comrade
a great, coarse, hideous Scotch smile.
I hate engineers, I hate Scotchmen, I hate brutes with free tickets,
who take the places of gentlemen who pay.
On alighting at Dover, and remembering the extravagance of
former charges at the Ship, under another Frº. (pray Heavens
the morrow's little bill may be a mild one !) I thought of going else-
where. Touters were about seizing upon the passengers and recom-
mending their hotels—“Now, GENTs, the GUN 1" roared one
monster. I turned sickening away from him. “Take me to the Ship”
I faintly gasped.
On proposing for dinner, the waiter says with an air as if he was
inventing something extremely clever “Whiting, Sir Nice fried

for long years and years until my soul is weary of them. “You great
ass” I felt inclined to exclaim, “I can get whiting and sole in Lon-
don, give me something new " * + +
Ah for that something new I have seen the dry toast come up for
my breakfast so many, many times—the same old tough stiff leathery
tasteless choky dry toast, that I can bear it no longer. The other
morning (I had been rather feverish all night) it came up and I de-
clare I burst into tears, “Why do you haunt me,” I said, “you demd
old toast ! What have I done that there is no other companion for me
but you? I hate and spurn you—and yet up you come. Day by day,
heartless brute, I leave you in the rack, and yet it's not you that
suffers torture:” and I made a passionate speech to that toast full of
eloquence, and howled and flung the plateful at the door—just as
Mary came in.
She is the maid. She could not understand my feelings. She is
contented with toast for breakfast, with bread I believe, poor wretch!
So are cows contented with grass. Horses with corn. The fine
spirit pants for novelty—and mine is sick of old toast.
“Gents” are spoken of familiarly even at this hotel. During
dinner a messenger comes to ask if a young “gent” was dining in
the coffee-room ;
“No,” says the waiter.
“How is that,” thinks I, “am I not a young gent myself?” He
continues, “There's two holdish ladies and a very young gent in
No. 24; but there’s only a MIDDLE-HAGED gent in the Coffee-room.”
Has it come to this, then Thirty something last birthday, and

ribaldry no more. Perhaps the sea may console me.
And how it’s only a dim straight line of horizon, with no
gaiety or variety in it. * A few wretched little vessels are twiddling
up and down. A steam-tug or two–yachts more or less—the town
is hideous, except for a neat row of houses or two—the cliffs only
respectable. The castle looks tolerable. But who, I should like to
know, would be such a fool as to climb up to it ! IIark 1 There is a
band playing—it is a long mile on, and yet I go to listen to it.
It is a band of wind-instruments of course, a military band, and

beer, (I'm forbidden it myself). They played so infernally out of
tune that they blasted me off the

cheap finery, and the grinning
yokels, and the maniacs riding
velocipedes.
This is what I saw most worthy

LORD LONDONDERRY'S SECOND UKASE.
LoNDoNDERRY has issued another tremendous ukase, warning all
the shopkeepers of Seaham against giving credit to his rebellious
pitmen. We have not room for the document which appeared in
the Chronicle, but its literature, without any signature, showeth its
origin. The egg declares the bird. If the inhabitants of Seaham
continue to trust the pitmen, Lond LoNDoNDERRY threatens that
he will immediately go down, and, carrying away the ocean from the
place, in some bucket made for the occasion; ruin the town for ever.
ROYAL SPOONS
Thr order of the Golden Fleece owes its origin to a Spanish king;
we think we may very soon expect that Isabel, LA of SPAIN will
establish the order of the Wooden Spoon. We found this belief on
the following recent incident :-
The QUEEN of SPAIN, with her pretty sister and gracious mother,
has visited Barcelona ; and with a fit of condescension that does
sometimes attack royalty, personally inspected all the barracks. The
soldiers were about to have their supper—a mess of rancho-served
to them, when, says the Times correspondent—
“At her Majesty's request the corporal, charged with the inspection of the cooking,
presented to her Majesty, in a wooden spoon, a portion of the rancho, which she touched
with her royal lips, and pronounced to be excellent, as a matter of course.”
The QUEEN Mother next tasted the rancho, and declared “it was
exquisite.” Then the INFANTE tasted, and in the ingenuousness of
youth made wry mouths at the mess, declaring she should be sorry to
have nothing else for dinner. How strange The daughter of
CHR1st INA, yet doubtless the child spoke the truth.
Now, the three spoons provided for the three pair of royal lips
were, we are told, shaped like the soldiers' spoons, but were of finer
material, and had the royal arms engraved thereon.
Now comes the reward of merit !
“After the ceremony of tasting was over, the spoons were presented to three of the
oldest and best-conducted soldiers, as a present from her Majesty, and a suitable speech
was made them by the BARoN DE MEsk, congratulating them on having in their posses-
sion those useful articles which had the high honour of having touched the lips of the
Queen ºf Spain, her mother, and sister.”
The spoons, being laurel-wood of course, have perhaps by this time
sprouted anew, and may be seen in full leaf in the caps of their
spoons.
happy successors :
Burke talked of “the chief defence of nations,” meaning thereby
the types of chivalry, as titles, stars and garters, &c.; but surely even
BUR KE never dreamt of such cheap material of defence as wooden
Happy soldiers taking their rancho out of spoons that have
touched royal lips. How fortunate, by the way, that wood is a
non-conductor.
However, the QUEEN, in a fine utilitarian spirit, presented the sol-
diers with really “useful articles.” Had it been Louis PHILIPPE,
he would have given worthless crosses, of no utility whatever.
Hence, we would have the Order of the Wooden Spoon, as one beau-
tifully combining usefulness with distinction. When we see stars
and crosses, and Orders of the Swan, the Eagle, the Elephant, and
of fifty other honest animals, whose names have—as we have often
thought—been equivocally dealt with, we are sometimes inclined to
ask—what is the good of them Now, of the Order of the Wooden
Spoon, we could put no such question. Besides, there are so many
men, with such very little right to the Orders they wear, and yet who
seem expressly made for the Order of the Spoon, as, indeed, the
Order of the Spoon should be instituted solely for them.
And then, in the case of lowly merit, could there be a more signi-
ficant gift from the great—born with Silver Ladles—than the present
of a Wooden Spoon 1
ficted rulugital intelligence.
DURING a recent thunder-storm it was observed by the passenger of
WIMBush's omnibus that the lightning was scarcely visible in consequence
of the conductor having stepped inside; and at a dinner-party on the same
day, three of the guests were laid prostrate by a sort of fluid–not the
electric fluid—with which they had very highly charged their glasses.

IR IS H IN T E L LIG E N C E.
(From our Dublin Correspondent).
THE Liberator is a greater man than ever since his im-
prisonment, for he has gained in bulk what he has lost in
influence. Good living has told terribly on his waistcoats,
which have been of necessity let out, though the Liberator
is himself kept in for the present.
Imprisonment we always said would be of no use, and
it will only cause the patriot to proceed to larger measures.
A letter to his tailor confirms our worst suspicions on this
head. O'Connell's coat's seams may give way, but his proud
spirit never. We have heard that the repeal Buttons of his
waistcoat started open while he was talking in his usual
inflated style on the subject of his country's wrongs, and
he laid open his heart in reality with a splendid burst of
nature. Gymnastics have been recommended to the Libe-
rator as the only means of bringing him down, and a pole
has been erected in the precincts of the prison, with a
Repeal Cap on the top of it. To this O'Connell clings with
all that affectionate intensity which characterises the ivy or
the scarlet runner. He will never sigh for other climes,
while he has repeal in view for his grand climacteric.
LORD BROUGHAM ON DEBT.
ORD BROUGHAM will very probably
carry his Debtors' Bill,
to the temporary confu.
sion of Lond CoTTEN-
HAM. The comical
HENRY was more than
usually jocose on bring-
ing up the report of the
measure. After his most
approved fashion did he
taunt Lord Cotte N-
HAM. He said:—
“If a man with 100l. a-year
unly ran in debt 20,000l., or if,
having little or no property, he
went to a tradesman, and in-
duced him to give up his property, a couple of thousand pounds' worth
of goods in which his capital was investcd, by appearing to him as a
person of wealth, he might as well rob the tradesman at once, and he
ought to be sent to Botany Bay for it, not because he was a debtor, but
º: he was a fraudulent individual, or an individual quasi fraudu-
ent.
After this, Lord Bhough AM complained that Lord
Cott ENHAM's Bill brought noble peers, nay princes of
the blood, within the operation of the Bankrupt Act 1
“Well, now suppose the PRINce to make some inquiries into this
unwelcome interference with his freedom. “What is the 'official assig-
nee 7' asks the PRINct or Wales. “Oh Sir, he is a very drastic
person; he sifts people’s affairs and property, and takes possession of
what they have not got rid of.” “Well, but cannot you let me keep
my pictures at Carlton-house?' 'Oh I dear no! not one. Your
Royal Highness is an adjudicated debtor.” (A laugh.) “An adjudi-
cated debtor' What is that?' 'Why, please your Royal Highness,
or whether it please your Royal Highness or not, it means in plain words
you are a bankrupt.’”
And then the PRINce remonstrates (through his advocate, Lond
BRough AM):—
“‘It is a very hard case,” complains the PRINCE, ‘why did you not apprise me of this
before ?' I should not have spent so much money in plate, or in horses; I should not hare
bought so much marischal powder; I should not hare presented so many jewels to this
person and to that. Why did you not give me notice of this before?’”
Now, surely, a Prince who outruns his income is no jot more pardon-
able for the extravagance than a poor man : nor should he have a
greater right to ask to keep his pictures, than the meaner person to
demand the use of his chairs and tables. As for the plate and
horses, and marischal powder, and jewels, why, change the words
for cigars and wine, and other creature comforts, and the like excuse
may be allowed to the poorest insolvent. There is, however, no
doubt that Lord Brough AM will carry his Bill. Can we wonder that
laws sometimes fall into contempt, when we consider the vain and
petty motives of those who make them t

THE SONG OF THE PINE APPLE.
The extraordinary glut of pines has made a deep im-
pression on the public mind. These are, indeed, revolu-
tionary times, when the highest luxuries of the aristocratic
table are meted out to the very mob at one penny per slice.
As for ourselves, we can only give full vent to a melan-
. strain of sentiment, which finds a natural termination
In the
SONG OF THE PINE-APPLE.
The gooseberry hath a pleasant gush,
As it leaps from its prison of skin,
And deep is the blackheart cherry's blush,
From the dark red juice within.
The raspberry hath a graceful hue,
As it grows on its stem so fine,
But hurrah 1 hurrah 1 hip, hip—halloo !
For the pine apple—the pine !
There's deep philosophy in the peach,
If its meaning were only known,
For a soft external (doth it not teach f)
May hide a heart of stone.
But, oh there's a fruit that is rough to view,
While within is a flavour divine,
Then hurrah 1 hurrah 1 hip, hip, hallool
For the pine apple—the pine !
Let others sing of the melon soft,
Which I own is exceedingly nice,
But remember that indigestion oft
Will lurk in each savoury slice.
And thou art wholesome and savoury too,
No flavour can equal thine ;
Then hurrah! hurrah 1 hip, hip, halloo !
For the pine apple—the pine !
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER V.—of FREEHOLDS NOT OF INHERITANCE.
A FREEhold not of inheritance is an estate, held for one's
own life, or for the life of somebody else, so that, a cat
having nine lives, it would seem that a grant to a cat and
his heirs would be almost as good as an estate in tail, for it
would extend to so many lives as to make it nearly equal to
a freehold.
A tenant for life has the right to enjoy the land in what-
ever way he pleases, so that he may roll about in the
asparagus beds, play at leapfrog over the gooseberry bushes,
or indulge in any other species of enjoyment which he
thinks the land is capable of affording him. He must not,
however, be guilty of waste on the premises, such as felling
timber; but he is not prohibited from domestic waste, such
as neglecting to eat his crusts, or buttering both sides of his
bread “as some folke,” says SPELMAN “dydde formerlie.”
If a tenant for life sows the land, and dies before harvest,
the executors are entitled to the crop; and it seems that if
a tenant for life has planted mustard and cress, but dies
before it comes up, his personal representatives may enjoy
the salad..
These profits are called emblements, and the doº-
trine of emblements applies not only to corn, but to
roots—though not to fruit-trees, so that the heir would
have the apples, but that the executors would have the parsley, and,
perhaps, the rhubarb. . Fruit-trees are not included, because they
are not planted annually for immediate profit; but if a gooseberry bush,
recently put in, bears fruit the first year, and the tenant for life dies,
it would be difficult to say whether the gooseberries would vest in the heir
or the executor. The better opinion seems to be, that it would be better
for the executor to relinquish the new gooseberries than to go to law with
the heir, which might play old Gooseberry with both of them:
There are one or two other kinds of life estates, which it is not neces-
sary to go into. Among them is tenancy by the curtesy of England.
Any gentleman endeavouring to keep up his tenancy by curtesy, alone—
without being able to pay the rent—would very soon be curtsied out by
his landlady, or bowed or kicked out by his landlord. There is also
tenancy in dower, where a widow gets one third of her husband's estate.
But a recent act has made it so easy to bar the dower, that the widows
are generally done out of their thirds; and instead of the corn, the fruit,
or even the vegetables, there is nothing left but the Weeds, with which
the unfortunate widows can console themselves.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
P A R LIA MENT A R Y REPO R. T.
(From our own Spy.)
hhough a private channel Punch has
been favoured with the following reve-
lations which have been elicited by the
Dog Stealing Committee.
“Miss TABITHA CRUMP examined :—
Is a maiden lady; her age of no conse-
quence to anybody. Is labouring under
severe domestic affliction from the loss
of her dear Pug. Should know him
among a thousand. Answered to the
name of Cupid. His muzzle was black ;
the rest of him whitey-brown: the little
creature was slightly corpulent. Should
rather think she knew what it was to
have a lover. Would much sooner
- have lost one than her Pug. Couldn't
think who had stolen her little dear.
Meant her Pug, not her lover. Wished
she did. Thought nothing would be too bad for him : should like to see
him hanged–transported—anything.”
“MR. John Thomas.—Is footman to LADY Dowager Doddlesworth.
Has various duties. Has to attend upon her Ladyship; also on her Lady-
ship's poodle—that is to say, her Ladyship's poodle as was. The hanimal
in question is stole. Should say he was an ansome dog. He was white,
and wore a ribbon the colour of his (John Thomas's) inexpressibles round
his neck. His name was Fy-Dell. His (John Thomas's) duties towards
the poodle consisted in giving him his meals, washing him with soap and
water, and combing him every morning; and shaving him, as such dogs
usually was, three times a week. The poodle had six meals a day of milk
and bread. Eat more than would keep three poor people's hinfants.
Lady Doddlesworth used often to muss him. Slept on a cushion in her
Ladyship's apartment. Thought the dog had an uncommon good place of
it: had a tolerable one himself, but shouldn't mind changing places with
him any day. Suspected some of them dog fanciers of having stole him.
Would swear he had not sold or made away with him himself.”
“SusAN TRIMMER.—Had been living in service, as nursemaid to MRs.
ALDERMAN Collop, at a terrace
near Regent's Park. Her mis-
tress was very fond of dogs;
keeps about nine. They were
little dogs. King Chawls's, she
thinks. One of their names was
Wenis. She (Wenis) used very
often to be let sit up at the table,
and eat off a plate. When she
was ill, she was wrapped up in
flannel, and put in a little cradle.
MRs. Collop had three little girls
and two boys. Couldn't say
which her mistress liked best,
them or her dogs. Wenis was
lost, and she (Susan) had lost her
place in consequence. (Here
witness cried.) Had to take the
children one day for a walk in the
Park; took Wenis too, by her
mistress's order. After walking
about some time, sat down on a
seat with the children. A gentle-
man came and sat down near them.
He was a gentleman from Albany
Barracks; a sergeant. The gen- 5
tleman began talking to her. Was:
walking with him, she dared say, R
half an hour. When she went
away, Wenis was gone. Was
afraid her mistress would refuse
her a character. Bother Wenis,
and all the rest l—wished they were drowned—that she did."
On the causes and means of prevention of the crime of canine kidnap-
ping, the labours of the Committee have as yet thrown little light; but
more or less information on those important subjects will very likely be
developed, in the course of time, by this interesting inquiry.
LITERARY INTELLIGENCE.
The next edition of the “Life of NElson” will, we understand, be
‘ done up in the plainest boards,” out of compliment to the present con-
dition of his statue,
RHETORIC OF THE COUNTER.
ANY Advertisements appear,
Genteel Address, for an As-
sistant to a Linen-draper.”
We now see what is meant
by a “genteel address.” It
is that conversational art
whereby the process, termed
“Shaving the Ladies,” is
effected.
“Shaving the Ladies” is a
very delicate operation; and
a few hints as to its mode of
performance may be accept-
able to those whom they may
concern :-
No sort of shaving can be
effected without soap, except
what is called “close shaving,”
as practised at workhouses and the mansion-house: without *...*
inquiring how drapers' assistants in general are circumstanced wit
respect to that article, Punch will at once present them with a little cake
of it; premising that the soap which the ladies are to be shaved with
must be particularly soft-soft soap, metaphorically speaking, is the
rhetoric of the counter.
The first figure to be studied in this species of rhetoric, is that called
hyperbole ; which is derived from two Greek words, signifying to over-
shoot: a feat to be accomplished by the use of the lº, ; that is to
say, by telling enormous fibs. So, when a lady asks, “Will this wash "
“Will that wear?” and so forth, no hesitation must be made in answer-
ing, or, if necessary, swearing in the affirmative.
Be careful in laying on your soap. You must not do this too violently.
Your situation, with respect to the lady whom you are to shave, is not
such as to admit of telling her that those sparkling eyes, those raven or
auburn tresses, that roseate cheek, that sylph-like form of hers will be set
off to such advantage by this or that silk, satin, muslin, bombazine, or
what not. You are only to insinuate all this.-As thus:—
* That pink lining, Miss, is lovely:-really quite lovely,–for any lady
with a delicate complexion.”
“Those flowers, ma'am, are exquisite to match dark hair and a high
forehead—I assure you they are considered so. If I might venture the
remark, ma'am, they would become a lady like yourself extremely.”
“This is an article, my lady, which I would strongly recommend to
your ladyship. It is true that it would only suit a first-rate figure ; but I
am quite confident it is just the dress for your ladyship.”
You will find it advantageous, having named a sum considerably above
the mark, to abate a little of it sometimes, and to lead a lady to suppose
that she has won upon you so to do. As, for instance—
“Well, really, ma'am, this is seventeen and six : but to you—I don't
mind saying sixteen.”
You will also do well to practise a little on female apprehension and
eagerness ; as follows—
*I assure you, miss, 'pon my honour, that this article is the very last
we have got ; and I am certain you won't meet with it at any other
establishment.”—The fact may be that both your master, and the man
over the way, are overstocked.
Removing the Rubbish.
It is the intention of Government, as soon as Parliament is prorogued,
to introduce the new Sweeping Machine into the House of Commons to
cart away those measures that have been dropt during the Session. If
this be true, HERCULEs's labour of cleansing the Augean stables will be
mere child's-play to it.

The Russian frigate Aurora, has just arrived with some valuable
presents for Her Majesty, and a quantity of gold, which, it is rumoured,
“has been sent to this country for the purpose of being refined.”. If this
gold comes from the mines of Siberia, the only method by which it can
possibly be refined, is to give it to the poor Poles.

LETTER XI.
FROM A TAILOR FOR HIS BILL,
S1 h,
WHEN you reflect upon the time that has passed, since you
did me the honour to enter my books, you will, I am sure, acquit me
of any desire to appear pressing. Five years, sir, make a long time
in the life of a tradesman; the more especially, with business as it
has been. Houses thought good, tumbling down like houses of cards;
men, considered men of rock, turning out men of straw ; bills sent
back, and a thousand other bits of bad luck, enough to break the
heart of any tradesman. It is now, sir, two-and-thirty years since I
entered business ; and, in all my life, I never knew so bad a season :
bad enough they have been, to be sure, but nothing like the present.
There was a time when a tradesman might now and then think of a
little profit; but profits in these days they don't pay for taking
down the shutters.
Therefore, sir, you will, I am sure, pardon me if I solicit you to
think of your account. It has been the golden rule of my life never
to press a gentleman; but, sir, I am like a peaceable man in a crowd;
if I am pushed, I must, whether I will or no, push other people.
What has come upon the times I know not ; men now ar'n't the men
they used to be. I recollect the day when, if a man failed to honour
his bill, he was never known to look up again. Now, I'm blessed if
he does n’t look all the bolder for it. People have entirely lost the
shame they had when I was young in business; and, now-a-days, go
into the Gazette as they go to Margate, just to freshen themselves
up, and feel all the stronger for it. The truth is—or I should never
think of pressing you, sir—there seems to be a want of morality
throughout all society. One person puts the evil down to one thing,
another to another. A neighbour of mine—a shrewd shoemaker of
the old school—swears it's all owing to the Adelaide boots.
For which reason, sir, I hope you will not think me urgent if I call
your thoughts to my bill. There was a time, sir, when I never
believed I could do such a thing; but, as I’ve said, I fear there’s no
morality left. And how, indeed, should there be Gentlemen are
no longer gentlemen. I have my grandfather's pattern-books by me,
sir. He—rest his soul—made for the West End eighty years ago,
and, when he died, was buried in superfine black, with twenty coaches
to follow. Now, die when I will, I much doubt if—but I have no
right to trouble you with my griefs—and so, sir, will stick to busi-
ness. In grandfather's time gentlemen were known to be gentlemen
by their coats. They walked about clothed and marked as superior
people; there was no mistake in them, and the lower orders knew
their betters by their satins, their velvets, and their gold lace. Now,
sir, how are we to know a gentleman There is no mark, no differ-
ence in him: we can only come at his gentility by his manners; a very
roundabout way, sir; and one that has led to a great many mistakes.
According to the good old plan, you might stand at your shop-door,
and count the real gentlemen as they passed; they wore—if I may
say as much—their proper uniform, and the common people paid
them proper respect for it. And now, if the grandfathers' ghosts of
the gentlemen of our day were to meet their grandsons in Piccadilly
or Bond Street, they’d take half of 'em for a set of carters, or
drovers, or some such low-animals; they wear nothing but sacks or
smock-frocks, with cotton buttons to 'em. Every day of his life, a
Duke passes my door to Parliament in a pepper-and-salt linsey-
woolsey, duffel, flannel sort of thing, that his tailor, try as hard as he
may, can't charge him more than two pounds for. And in this con-
dition his Grace goes to make laws in Parliament. After this, I
should like to know how it's to be hoped that common folks are to
respect the House of Lords? It's flying in the face of nature to
expect it.
No, sir, there is the evil; there the abuse that has, as I’ve often
said, sapped the morals of the world, by hustling all folks together
in the same cloth and the same cut. It was never intended that the
lines of society should be so finely drawn by the tailor, that you could
not see them ; yet, because it is so, you now have all sorts of discon-
tent, no stability in trade, and no real morals in gentlemen : if the
upper classes would only show their true dignity, and return to cut
velvet and gold lace, there might even now be some hopes of the
country; but while noblemen and gentlemen dress in thirty-shilling
coats, there is an end to England. Her real glory set with gold lace.
If men never felt the National Debt, it was because they wore
embroidered pocket-holes.
You will forgive me troubling you with all this, but I could not
think of putting your account into my lawyer's hands without
showing to you the troubles that a tradesman has in these days to
fight with.
Hoping you will therefore not take the writ amiss,
I remain, your obedient Servant,
SAMUEL STITch INGTon.
LETTER XII.
The GENTLEMAN'S ANSWER TO THE TAILOR.
MR. StitchingtoN.
Is it indeed five years that I have graced your books 1 How
fleet is life—it scarcely appeared to me as many months. Although
I have never given you a bill for the amount, how have the years
passed by 1 You will guess my meaning when I assure you it is a
theory of mine that the wings of time are no other than two large
bill stamps, duly drawn, and accepted. With these he brings his
three, six, or nine months into as many weeks. He is continually
wasting the sand from his glass, drying the wet ink of promissory
notes. But let me not moralise.
You want money, MR. Stitchington. As I am exactly in the
like predicament, you are in a capital condition to sympathise with
me. You say you never recollect so bad a season as the present.
Of course not ; no tradesman ever did : the present season is always
the worst of the lot, however bad the others may have been. It says
much for the moral and physical strength of such shopkeepers to see
them still flourishing from worse to worse; they really seem, like
churchyard grass, to grow fat and rank upon decay. You touchingly
observe that present profits do not pay for taking down the shutters.
My good sir, then why proceed in a ruinous expense In the name
of prudence, why not keep them continually up !
You say you never press a gentleman. Why, in familiar phrase,
we never press a lemon ; but then we squeeze it most inexorably.
That men should go into bankruptcy, yet live and laugh afterwards,
is a great proof of the advancing philosophy of our times. A Roman
tailor, incapable of meeting his bill, would, heathen-like, have fallen
upon his own needle, or hung himself—in a bottom of whitey-brown.
The English tradesman suffers christian hope to play about his
goose, and fresh from Basinghall-street dreams of golden eggs.
Whether your neighbour is right in attributing our present social
laxity to the Adelaide boot, is a matter I have no time to consider.
The speculation is curious; nevertheless, rigidly to follow the subject
would take us even beyond metaphysics.
You are quite right, MR. StitchingtoN, as to the revolutionary
effects of the disuse of velvet and gold lace. It is not, I assure you,
my fault that they are not again the vogue. If permitted, I should
be happy to have a dozen suits of you. Fine clothes were a sort of
gentleman-made-easy; as you profoundly observe, they at once
declared the man. Now, one has to work out the gentleman by
one's mode and manners—at times, I assure you, a very difficult
labour.
I entirely agree with you as to the cause that has lowered the
consequence of Parliament—the vile, plebeian outside of England's
senators. I hold it almost impossible that a nobleman can vote with
a proper respect for his order unless in full court-suit. There is a
dangerous sympathy between common garments and the common
people. The Reform Bill had never been carried if Lord Brougham
had not worn tweed trousers. Universal Suffrage will be carried—

THE REPORT ON DOG STEALING.
We have received a copy of the Parliamentary Report on Dog Stealing,
which is in a terribly dog's-eared state. The most interesting portion of
the Report is a manuscript Appendix, from which we have selected the
two following cases:–
CASE I.
EARL Grey had a very snappish dog called Brough AM : he was a very
sharp animal of the Scotch breed; but so uncommonly vicious that EARL
GREY was looking out for an opportunity to get rid of him. Having let
his place to Lond Melbour.NE, EARL GREY gave him the option of the
Dog Brougham ; but Load Melbourne would have nothing to do with
him. The dog was left to go astray, and for some time he used to come,
and lick the hand of his old master, who used to pat him on the head,
and say “poor fellow,” but he could do nothing for him. At last the
old dog went and scratched at LoRD MELBourne's door, wanting to come
in, and waited patiently for some time; but at last he got rather savage
and barked, but no attention was paid to him. Some Tory dog-stealers
who were lurking about the Treasury whistled to the old dog, and by
throwing him down a bit of sop occasionally, succeeded in getting him
away.
Somebody who took an interest in the dog then called at the treasury
and wanted to get them to buy BRough AM back again. Lord Melbourne
said the dog was of no use, that he was more trouble than he was
worth, that he was dangerous, and that he, Lond Melbourne, would
rather, do without him. The dog is now in the hands of the people who
lured him away, and it is said they would be very glad to give him up,
for he is of no use except to worry the rats now and then; but he will
hang about the old place, and fawns, so upon his new masters that they
don't like to kick him out entirely. The old dog has got some funny tricks,
and is now rather an amusing animal, but beyond this he is now of no
value.
CASE II.
A little turnspit named Roebuck came from Bath, and was picked up
by somebody who offered him for sale, but for a long time the dog could
not find a purchaser. At last it was thought he might be useful in
snapping at people's heels, and he was bought by the late Lord DURHAM.
The dog got a good deal kicked about and was bought by an Ex-Chancellor,
who dressed him up in a silk gown, and made him cut a very laughable
figure. After this he was offered for sale again, and he could easily be
had if the price were to be given.
THE FéTEs of JULY.
On Saturday Louis-Philippe visited the fortifications, and was graciously
pleased to express his royal satisfaction as to the very handsome way in
which Paris had been “taken in.”. In the evening the whole of the ten-
ceinte continuée.” was brilliantly illuminated.
On Sunday the 47 editors imprisoned in France were regaled, by the
King's orders, with an additional allowance of pain bis and win ordi-
naire. Several toasts in honour of the revolution were drunk in-cold

BY our FAT contRIBUTOR.
The sea.
I HAD one comfort in quitting Dover. It was to see TowzER, my
tailor, of St. James's Street, lounging about the pier in a marine
jacket, with a tuft to his chin.
His face, when he saw me in the boat, was one of the most intense
agony. I owe TowzER 2031.
“Good bye, TowzER,” I said. “I shall be back in four years."
And I laughed a demoniac yell of scorn, and tumbled clattering down
the brass stairs of the cabin.
An Israelite had already taken the best place, and was preparing
to be unwell. I have observed that the “Mosaic Arabs,” as CoNINgsby
calls them, are always particularly amenable to maritime discomfiture.
The Jew's internal commotions were frightful during the passage.
* Two Oxford youths, one of whom had been growing a moustache
since the commencement of the vacation, began to smoke cigars, and
assume particularly piratical airs.
I took the picture of one of them an hour afterwards—stretched
lifeless on the deck, in the agonies of sea-sickness.
I will not print that likeness. It is too excellent. If his mamma
saw it, she would catch her death of fright, and order her darling
ToMMY home. ... I will rather publish the following—
That man is studying LEv1zAc's grammar. He is a Scotchman.
He has not the least sense of modesty. As he gets up phrases out
of that stale old grammar of 1803 (he bought cheap on a stall in
Glasgow), the wretch looks up, and utters the sentences he has just
acquired—serves them up hot in his hideous jargon. “Parly roo
Fransis,” says he, or “Pranny garde de mong tait.” He thinks he has
quite the accent. He never doubts but that he is in a situation to
cope with the natives. And au fait, he speaks French as well as many
Belgians or Germans in those lands whither he is wandering.
Poor Caledonian youth ! I have been cramming him with the most
dreadful lies all the way. I should have utterly bewildered him, and
made him mad with lies, but for this circumstance :—
In the middle of a very big one, which (administered by me) was
slipping down his throat as glibly as an oyster, there came up from
the cabin a young woman, not very pretty, but kind-looking, and she
laid her hand upon the shoulder of that Levizac-reading Scotchman,
and smiled, and he said with an air of immense superiority—
“Wall, Eliza, are ye batter noo !”
It was his wife She loved him. She was partial to that snob.
She did not mind the strings of his shirt-collar sticking out behind
his back.
Gentle Eliza a man whom you love and whose exposed follies
would give you pain, shall never be made the butt of the Fat Contri-
butor.
It will hardly be credited—but, upon my honour, there are four
people on deck learning French dialogues as hard as they can. There
is the Oxford man who is not sick. A young lady who is to be the
spokeswoman of her party of nine. A very pompous man, who
swore last night in my hearing that he was a capital hand at French,
and the Caledonian student before mentioned.
What a wise race : They learn French phrases to speak to German
waiters, who understand English perfectly.

The couriers and gentlemen's servants are much the most distingué-
looking people in the ship. Lond Murrington was on board, and
of course I got into conversation with his Lordship—a noble-looking
person. But just when I thought he might be on the point of asking
me to lº. Castle, he got up suddenly, and said, “Yes, my
Lord,” to a fellow I never should have suspected of a coronet. Yet
he was the noble Earl, and my friend was but his flunky.
Such is life! and so may its most astute observers be sometimes
deceived.
Ostend, August 6.
While the couriers, commissioners, footmen, gentlemen, ladies'-
maids, Scotchman with the shirt-collar, the resuscitated Oxford
youth, the family of nine, and the whole ship's passengers are strug-
gling, puffing, stamping, squeezing, bawling, cursing, tumbling over
their boxes and one another's shins, losing their keys, screaming to
the commissioners, having their treasures unfolded, their wonderful
packed boxes unpacked so that it is impossible ever to squeeze the
articles back into their receptacles again; while there is such a scene
of Babel clatter and confusion around me, ah! let methank Heaven
that I have but a carpet bag!
Any man going abroad who purchases this number of Punch a day
previous to his departure, will bless me for ever. Only take a carpet
bag You can have everything there taste or luxury demands; six
shirts, a fresh suit of clothes, as many razors as would shave the
beards of a regiment of Turks, and what more does a traveller require?
Buy nothing. Get a reading of Munnay's Guide Book from your
neighbour, and be independent and happy.
My acquaintance, the Hon. JAMEs Jrtly flower was in the boat
with fifteen trunks as I am a sinner. He was induced to take packages
for his friends. This is the beauty of baggage—if you have a bag,
you can refuse. On this score Irefused twenty-four numbers of the
Metropolitan Magazine, a teapot, and a ham, which he accepted.
Lady Scramjaw—the packet was opened before my eyes by the
custom-house officers at Ostend—gave JILLY Flowen a parcel of law
papers to carry to Italy, “only deeds upon her honour,” and deeds
they were, but with six pair of gloves inside. All his fifteen trunks
were opened in consequence of that six pair of gloves. He is made
miserable for those gloves. But what cares Lady Scramjaw Let
all travellers beware then, and again and again bless me for the hint.
I have no passport. They have arrested me.
I am about to be conducted to the police. I may be put into a

THE STATUE OF WELLINGTON.
The following piece of City news is extracted from the Eraminer: —
“The name "Wellington" is about to be inscribed on the four sides of the base of
the wºulington statue in the City; and ‘The 18th of June, 1815, on the upper edge,
under the fore feet of the horse, and also under the hinder feet.”
This is almost as good as the name of the raging lion being inscribed
on the signboard of the raging lion, to indicate the fact of the lion being
a lion, and also a raging one. To put the 18th of June under all the feet
looks a good deal like keeping it out of sight; but perhaps it is meant to
show that the 18th of June is what WELLINgton's military reputation
chiefly stands upon.
British and Foreign Institute.
The Times has been requested by MR, Silk Buckingham to state that
the bankruptcy of the Hotel next door does not affect the solvency of the
British and Foreign Institute. We have ascertained and have been
requested by nobody to add, that the British and Foreign Institute takes
such good care of itself that the bankruptcy of the whole street would not
affect the solvency of the concern.
The British and Foreign Institute is next door but one to the corner of
George-street, and is consequently No. 2, while the Hotel is No. 1. The
bankruptcy of the latter is an extraordinary instance of MR. Silk
Buckingham, not having taken that care of Number One, which it is
customary for him to hºw upon it.

THE GREAT AGRICULTURAL SHOW.
*Naving despatched
a correspondent
to Southampton,
expressly to re-
port the proceed-
ings at this Show, we
are sorry to say he
was so hustled among
heifers, pushed about
among pigs, horrified
at the hogs, deafened
by the shouts of the
drovers, and, in fact,
so completely worried
on all sides, that he
is unable to remember
anything. He tells us
that he got his toes
trodden on by a Prize
Bull; and the noble
beast, being quite
unaware of the cir-
cumstance, did not
move his hoof for ten
minutes, during which
our “own correspon.
* dent” was in agony,
* attempting in vain to
withdraw his foot, or
to push the leg of the
generous animal from
the top of it.
The agricultural
implements were
completely beyond
the comprehension of
our correspondent,
who could not make
out what they were
intended for, and,
venturing on a closer
inspection, got caught
in a sort of ploughing apparatus, from which he was extricated by one
of the attendants, after having been abused for his clumsiness. The
whole affair was exceedingly unsatisfactory to our “own correspondent,”
whose report is extremely meagre in consequence.
He, however, furnishes us with an extract from a Southampton paper
containing an account of a public dinner given on the occasion, which we
are sorry we cannot give at length, for the report is replete with richness.
“The dinner,” says the provincial historian, “was a cold one—and the
wines were-for the price—very good.”
What a world of meaning lurks in those little words “for the price.”
How craftily qualified is the praise bestowed on the wines; “very good
for the price,” speaks volumes, and the phrase brings us back to those
days when the enterprising CANN offered “a devilish good dinner for 24d.”

window-bill :-

The bill of fare of the very good dinner “for the price,” would lead us
to calculate that, instead of Bordeaux of the vintage of '42, there might
possibly have been Cowslip of the haymaking of '43; and a choice bin of
Elder was, we believe, opened to do honour to the truly British occasion,
where truly British hearts were inspired by truly British wines with truly
British sentiments.
The following is an extract from the bill of fare; which, though con-
sisting of next to nothing, was set out in three columns, with all the
pomp of a bill of fare on Lord Mayor's Day, at the Mansion House:–

In looking critically into this bill of fare, we cannot blind ourselves to
the fact that beef and ham constitute the principal—nay, the only—meats;
while, in the matter of vegetables, there is a struggle for ascendancy be-
tween salad and potatoes. On the subject of salad, it would be idle to say
a word ; while, as to potatoes, the track is so beaten that we should be
travelling over unprofitable ground were we to go deeply into them.

(58 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The King of the City having expressed his determination to pay a round
of visits to the whole of the river pierage, the necessary steps were taken
—a temporary ladder—to assist the embarkation of his civic Majesty.
At the appointed hour the civic barge was alongside the stairs, and the
round towards the shore—this, and the other adjuncts of the gorgeous
scene, presented a coup-d'oeil which few could witness without emotion ;
and, when the barge was pushed off with a tremendous splash, there was
scarcely a dry eye among all the bystanders. The party consisted of some
civic friends, and at a given signal the Lord Mayor manned the easy chair
that had been prepared for him, while a select party of Aldermen took up
their places on either side as ballast, and trimmed the boat with a sea-
manlike precision which would have done NELson's heart good if he
could have witnessed it.
A shout from the shore, echoed by a scream from the boat, as she
lurched while shoving off, announced that the voyage had commenced, and
the barge, with its illustrious cargo, was soon cutting away at ten knots an
hour, in half a fathom of water, with a sou'-westerly breeze, and the ship's
compass pointing towards Baker Street. It was soon announced by the lar-
board watch on the look-out ahead that Southwark was heaving in sight on
the starboard quarter; and a signal having been hoisted—abird's-eye gules,
on a Bandanna argent—it was answered from the bridge by the national
variations of Lul-li-e-tee, executed by a juvenile band accidentally in
attendance, arranged as a concerted piece for four windpipes. A salute,
consisting of several handfuls of gravel, was discharged from the bridge
as the barge passed under it; ºft. juvenile band, with considerable
promptitude, ran to receive the craft at the other side with a renewal of the
popular air with which the first appearance of the barge had been greeted.
is civic Majesty then neared the pier, having carefully avoided the
Rocks AHEAD,
and received the following address, which was read in a loud and impres-
sive style by the check-taker:—
“The pier of Southwark, though of comparatively modern creation,
will yield to no member of the pierage in firmness to support the civic

coloured craft in the foreground, with her cutwater turned contemptuously

THE LORD MAYOR'S VISIT TO THE RIVER PIERS.
throne, or to bear the weight of any responsibility your Majesty may
think fit to impose upon it.”
To the above address the Lord Mayor made the following gracious
reply:—“If every pier were as firm as the pier of Southwark, the whole
of the river pierage might, indeed, be most implicitly relied upon.”
Having admired a marquee over the Southwark pier, his civic Majesty
was graciously pleased to command that the Southwark pier should, in
honour of the said marquee, assume the title and dignity of a marquess.
The barge having passed Blackfriars, the Temple pierage was the next
in order. The patent of pierage dates from a comparatively remote period,
and the dignity was first conferred upon one of the elder Barges for some
services rendered in landing some packages intended for William IV.,
and conveyed through MESSRs. Chaplin And HoRNE, the carriers. Here,
unfortunately, a feud happened to be raging, for the dignity is hotly con-
tested by two parties, whose retainers are stationed to enforce allegiance
from the passengers to that particular pier of which each is a partisan.
The Lord Mayor, declining to venture into the bosom of a civil, or rather
most uncivil, war, gave a signal to the coxswain to keep the barge's head
still to leeward, and having put up an umbrella to act as a gaff, which the
captain of the vessel said, if he had got, he should certainly like to hoist,
the craft went on at an improved pace towards Hungerford.
It would be tedious to accompany his Lordship on his visit to the whole
of the River Pierage; and the civic authorities who went with him would
have been of the same opinion if the vessel had not been liberally
victualled from the larder of the London Tavern.
Having regaled themselves freely with the wines, the Lord Mayor and
his guests came to the conclusion that the piers came doubly as far into
the river as they ought, that they shook about prodigiously with craziness,
and that they seemed to be turning round and round with the force of the
current. . Upon these grounds the whole of the river piers were univer-
sally condemned as nuisances, and the following regulations were drawn
up on the spur of the moment—the said regulations having been subse-
quently put into the shape in which they appeared in the newspapers.
The following were the rules drawn up immediately after the dinner,
which took place in the civic barge :-
1st. That no pier shall be allowed to go beyond a certain length, and
that the lengths, LoRD BRough AM goes to, as a peer, are greater than
ought to be permitted.
2nd. That every pier shall be of a certain thickness at the head, but
that no peer ought to be thicker in the head than Lond Londonderry.
3rd. That there should be a chain and a drag ready on every pier, in
case of any one tumbling into the water, which, by the by, is very likely
to happen with a chain for everybody to trip over.
4th: That there shall be holdfasts driven into every pier, to catch any
one who falls overboard—if, as he is tumbling, it occurs to him that he
may as well stop half-way down before he reaches the water.
The resolutions were here interrupted by a general chorus of “We
won't go home 'till morning,” and the Lord Mayor having vacated the
chair, the Aldermen presented sundry Heads,which were laid upon the table.
EDUCATIONAL HANDKERCHIEFS.
We have seen with considerable satisfaction that the schoolmaster has
been abroad even to the Bandannas—or, in other words, that fine moral
lessons are imparted through the medium of silk pocket handkerchiefs.
Instead of the old unmeaning bird's-eye pattern, by which the mouchoir
was formerly adorned, we have a series of highly finished designs illustra-
tive of “great facts” in reading, writing, or arithmetic. Science of every
description is now taught through the Inedium of the pocket handkerchief,
and learning is thus thrust under the very nose of the public. Some were
inclined to think that pocket handkerchiefs applied to science, would be
the means of giving it a very severe blow ; while others believed that the
plan would be sure to succeed, for the public are easily led by the nose,
and a great moral truth is never so well inculcated as when it is nicely
wrapped up in the folds of a silk pocket handkerchief. It is true that
philosophy is not a thing to be sneezed at, and the Lights of the age might
stand a chance of being snuffed out, if the pupils took snuff while using
| the handkerchiefs on which the glorious coruscations of the luminary in
question might be emblazoned. We are, however, happy to find that the
experiment is to be tried, and we are enabled to state that a Primer has
been prepared, in a series of two handkerchiefs, one in use and the other
at the wash, according to the custom of most economical families.
A geography will be comprised in a set of four handkerchiefs, so that the
student may wipe away the dust from his forehead with a map of his
native land, and he will thus be able to keep England in his eye as long as
he may find it convenient.
An arithmetical series will also be very interesting, and that this idea
can be carried out is easily proved by the fact that the pocket handker-
chief has often served for working various lessons in Subtraction, some of
which have required considerable ingenuity.
Law may also be inculcated in the same manner, and as it is often paid
—
for through the nose, it may surely be acquired through the pocket hand.
kerchief. We understand that the series will be placed under the super
intendence of the editor of the Metropolitan Magazine, who is likely to
produce a dry soft article, extremely well adapted to the purpose.

THE AFFAIR AT TAHITI.
LL the following are unpublished proclama-
tions of the French Commandant.
They were a few of the original drafts
from which he concocted the docu-
ments that were actually issued:—
No. 1.-A French sentinel has had
his nose pulled in the night; perfidious
Albion has had a finger in it. The in-
habitants are warned against having
lights in their houses after dark. All
candles must be extinguished at three
o'clock in the afternoon ; and any
stranger found in ..} house after gun-
fire, will subject the landlord to death,
and all the lodgers to banishment.
No. 2.-A French sentinel has been
insulted. A blacking-bottle has been
thrown at him ; and one PRItch ARD is believed to have been at
the bottom of it. The inhabitants must hold no communication with
each other after twilight. If anybody causes disturbances, everybody
is subject, not only to be shot dead, but to be arrested.
No. 3.-PR1Tch ARD is taken Perfidious Albion is in the station-
house, in the person of her consul.
No. 4.—The inhabitants are prohibited from setting a light to any
thing—even a cigar—after gun-fire.
No. 5–PR1tch ARD is to be waited upon by one servant, who is
not to speak to him. Clean clothes are to be conveyed to him once

RATIONAL READINGS FOR GROWN-UP PEOPLE.
The grand object of modern educational science is the instruction of
the asinine intellect. This is the great problem of which each new
hornbook professes to be a solution. Among various notable expedients
for the enlightenment of the dolt and the edification of the booby, is a late
invention, of a two-fold title, denominated “Rational Readings” and
“Elliptical Questions;” well known, we apprehend, to the world in
general, from having been ridiculed in the last Quarterly.
These “Readings” and “Questions” consist of sentences wherein a
word or phrase is omitted ; what such word or phrase, if inserted, would
have been, being obvious to the meanest, one degree above the idiotic,
capacity. As, for instance—
“Winegar is , and sugar is sour.”
From this example (and it is a fair one) it will appear that about these
“Questions” and “Readings” there is much more of the “Elliptic"
than of the “Rational.”
Now, it has occurred to Punch, that this device, if not available for the
purpose of instruction, might yet be rendered conducive to that of amuse-
ment; in the shape of what are called puzzles. His readers, no doubt,
will find themselves agreeably puzzled to fill up the blanks in the
ensuing :-
The Income — imposed upon the country by Sir Robert Peel, is a
heavy — on the back of Bull.
Lord and VAux has a — in every pie.
“Great cry and little ——” should be the motto of the House of
Commons.
MR. Joseph HUME is always putting his — in it.
Colonel Sibthorp never gets on his legs without creating a -— at his
own expense.
Whether or not the sense of the country brought Ministers “in,” it has
certainly “found them ––.”
The boast of Old England are its “Wooden ——” and white cliffs, –
Young England is renowned for —— heads and —— waistcoats.
If people may, without rebuke,
Call Wellington the “Iron ——,”
Why then we safely may presume
The “Brazen Peer” to term Lord ––.”
The above “Rational Readings,” like the originals, will have probably
taught people nothing but what they knew before ; but if the facts con-
tained in them are not very new, Punch verily believes they are
extremely true.
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE sixth. – OF ESTATES LESS THAN FREE hold.
Estates less than freehold are of three sorts: 1st, for years; 2d, at will ;
and 3d, by sufferance.
An estate for years is where a man takes premises on a lease, which
may be for half a year, or even a quarter; but still it is a lease for years,
because the law does not take notice of anything less than a year—for the
law has nothing to do with halves—never doing anything by halves—and
will not recognise quarters; “for the law,” says Jones, “giveth quarter
to nobody.”
The law of England has a peculiar division of time; and though the
old wags have said in the books, that “legal time shoudde bye ryghte be
sixe-eighte time—for thatte sixe and eighte pence be ye lawyer's fee"—
still the old wags have thrown no light upon the subject.
A year, says Cocker, consists of 365 days, except in leap-year, when
there are 366, but the 21st of Henry the Third merges the added day in
the day before ; so that, on the 28th of February, to-day is, in fact,
to-morrow, while the day after is, by act of Parliament, yesterday, for all
legal purposes. A month is either lunar or calendar; but a month in
law is lunar, unless otherwise expressed,—for there is a natural affinity
between law and lunacy. A day includes all the twenty-four hours, for
the law makes no distinction between day and night, but loveth the dark-
ness of the latter better perhaps than the light of the former.
We are however losing sight of an estate for years, which is often called
a term, because it must have an end or terminus; but it might as well be
called a railroad, as far as that goes, because every railroad must have a
terminus.
Estates for years must also have a certain beginning and a certain end ;
but so must almost every thing, except a jack-towel, which has neither one
nor the other.
It is a settled principle of law, that an estate is a freehold if it is for
one's own life, or for anybody else's ; the latter being called in the sort
of Cockney French of the jurists, who probably picked it up at Boulogne
during the long vacation, an estate pur auter vie. But an estate for
1,000 years is only a chattel, and less than a freehold, which we can
hardly understand, unless the auter vie should be such another vie as that
of METhuselah or Widdicombe, but even then the estate for 1,000 years
would have a small majority in its favour.
A freehold must commence immediately and not in futuro, because there
must be seisin; but a lessee for years need not be seised, though his goods
may be seized, and probably would be seized if he neglected to pay the
rent of his premises.
A tenant for a certain number of years is not entitled to emblements,
because if he is fool enough to plant peas in February, and he is com-
pelled to march out of possession in March, he must leave the peas and
take the consequences. In the same way if he has sown wheat in June,
and is compelled to quit at Midsummer, he cannot reap the wheat, nor
reap the benefit to be derived from it.
An estate at will is where the lessor may kick out the lessee at pleasure;
as where A lets to B, and A changes his mind directly B has moved in
his goods, and A orders B to be off, and B, being merely tenant at will,
is compelled to mizzle. It is evident that lessor gets the best of it in an
estate at will ; and, as to lessee, “it is clear,” says SALKELD, “the less he
has to do with such an estate, the better.”
An estate at sufferance is where a man is not actually kicked out, but is
clearly kick-out-able; as if he has taken a lease for a year, and the year
has expired, and he either won't or don't go—he is a tenant at sufferance.
When, however, tenant at sufferance becomes insufferable, the landlord
must enter and oust him, or he will be guilty of laches, or neglect. But
if tenant locks himself in, the landlord can avoid laches—or latches—by
forcing the bolts, after a regular process of ejectment.
By recent statutes an insufferable tenant at sufferance must pay double
rent if he refuses to go after regular notice, but if he has been in the habit
of paying no rent at all, the penalty will not be a very heavy one.
Realth of the Metropolis.
Theae has been a good deal of illness in the City, and some of the civic
dignitaries have not escaped. There have been some severe cases brought
on by an over indulgence in the luxury of gooseberry-fool during the early
part of the fruit season. SIR PETER LAURE has been among the principal
sufferers ; and, though the skill of his physician has succeeded in getting
rid of the gooseberry, the other part of the deleterious mixture, there is
reason to fear, is regularly implanted in the system.
The BONDS OF FRien Dship.
The Pennsylvanians have been shedding each other's blood. This is the
last method they have adopted for “paying people off."

"HIS affair came off on the 3rd of August. It was arranged
that the party should go down by a wherry, though some of the
Ministers have not been in the habit of rowing in the same boat on
ordinary occasions. Bhough AM was not invited to be of the party,
but the Ex-chancellor had made up his mind to hook himself on to
their boat, in accordance with his usual custom. The particulars of
the White Bait Dinner itself would not be interesting. On the bill
being brought in there was a good deal of inferior joking on the sub-
ject of “passing it,” letting it “lie on the table,” and having it “read
again on that day six months.” The waiters of course were com-
pelled to laugh at these miserable specimens of ministerial wit, and
SiR JAMEs GRAHAM even went so far as to let the document fall in
order that he might pun upon the circumstance by alluding to the
bill as one of the dropped bills of the session. Even the waiter was
unable to laugh at this exceedingly small wit, and the Home Secre-
tary was put down by the general “Oh oh 1 oh 1” of the entire com-
pany. While the glass was circulating pretty freely the Premier
was called upon for a song, and he immediately burst forth into the
following impromptu, written for him expressly to order, by the
only English Improvisatore :-
Come, list my lads, my jolly lads, and now without digression,

of Woods and Forests, to wit, the trustees of Regent Street, be em.

opinion of the said Beadles, do anything to deserve the kicking, whacking,

is also a sumptuary clause, stating the expense, with a fiscal section,
determining the salary of the Beadles, which will be a charge on the
consolidated fund, or paid out of the revenues of the duchy of Pad

PUNCH*S DEMONOLOGY.
here are some persons who deny
the existence of Demons';
but Punch begs to assure
them that they are quite
wrong, for he has seen thou-
sands with his own eyes. It
was but the other day that
he beheld , some twenty
fiends, with horns, and tails,
and cloven feet, brandishing
torches, seize upon an Italian
gentleman of the name of
For Nasari, and descend with
him bodily, in the midst of
fire and smoke, through the
floor, in the presence of a
large company of fashionable
people, to the great admira-
tion of the lookers-on. After
which a number of gay young
ladies, in short dresses and
spangles, came and danced
over the very spot, just as if
nothing had happened.
The Prince of Demons is
not, as has been erroneously
supposed, an old gentleman, but one under the middle age, and his name
is O. Smith. Punch has seen him appear repeatedly; but not of late.
At one time he used to be raised nearly every night, by a conjuler of the
name of Fitzball, at a place in the Strand, where another conjurer
was exhibiting his wonders. This demon takes many shapes, and has
several names, of which the most notorious are “The Bottle Imp"
and “The Flying Dutchman.”
The following are Demons of great celebrity :—
1. Zamiel.—This is a demon in the shape and attire of a huntsman:
He does not, however, wear cords and top-boots, nor what you would
exactly call a scarlet coat. His apparel consists of a great slouched hat
and feathers, a huge cloak, and buskins ; all of which, together with his
hands and face, are of one uniform red tint. He looks, in short, as if he
had been rolled in brick-dust or powdered red ochre...He has a particu,
larly large hooked nose, something like a Jew's, which there is, gºod
reason for believing to consist of paste-board; and he wear; his locks,
or rather his wig, for that is what it really is, very long, all down his
shoulders. He has been several times seen to throttle HERR Staudigl,
and to carry away Messrs. H. Phillips and Paul Bedfond to the in:
fernal regions. His apparition is generally accompanied by a gong, and
attended with a strong smell of brimstone and saltpetre. He seems par-
tial to snakes and skeletons, of which, on grand occasions, he has alwa
a lot surrounding him. His other names besides Zawiei, are W. H.
Parne and Howell, under which he sometimes appears as Harlequin.
2. MEPhIstophiles.—The demon so named appears as a gallant of the
middle ages, in his Sunday best: with slashed sleeves and hose on, and a
little round cap with a cock's-tail feather in it on the top of his head.
He looks very sly and sarcastic, an expression which he owes to his eye.
brows being touched up and pointed with cork, and to a slight smudge of
paint, made by a hare's foot on either cheek. The rest of his face is
deadly pale, except his eye-lids, round which also the hare's foot has been
applied. He carries a little spit of a rapier at his side, and wears a slight,
peaked moustache on the upper lip. Sometimes he is seen as a dancing
devil, in the person of a little Frenchman.
3. As Modeus.-This is a little imp, otherwise called Wieland. He goes
hopping about on a couple of crutches, illustrating the academico-arith:
metical operation denominated “dot and go one.” He is a terrible devil
among the fair sex, to whom he plays the dancing-master, and with whom,
divers pranks, to the great diversion of the British Public.
Besides these, there are—
Certain Witches, whose names are MEADows, HARLEy, and Compton.
A castle-haunting Specrae, now seldom seen, at least on this side of the
water.
A Ghost ; whose Christian-name is John and surname Cooper, and
who used to appear every Easter Monday, or Boxing night, in the shape
of George Barnwell.
• A supernatural Statue on horseback, who nods and sings in his saddle,
accepts a libertine nobleman's invitation to supper, and comes there
stalking on foot.
Other demons, witches, and spirits, there are, of less note, to be seen.
The majority of them drink porter when they can get it ; eat bread and
cheese, provided they can earn it; which is not always: and smoke
more or less tobacco. Punch is sorry to say that they are mostly very
poor devils, in many cases with wives and families and deserving much
to be pitied.
THE FRIGHTS OF THE BALLET.
THE announcement of a work on the subject of the Beauties of
the Opera has suggested to Punch the happy notion of a literary
undertaking, to be devoted to the Frights of the Ballet. Each
fright will be complete in himself, and four frights, stitched in a neat
wrapper, will constitute a part, while a dozen frights done up in
cloth—though anything but lettered—will form a volume.
In order to put the very worst face possible upon the matter, we
commence our frights with Mons. Arlo MB, who enjoys, it is said,
the countenance of the aristocracy. We are thus enabled to view
him under a new aspect, and to dwell on those features of his history
which are the most pleasing, if not the most prominent.
A Plomb is one of those artists who, instead of trusting to his face,
is content to stand upon his legs, and these have successfully carried
him to that position in public favour which he at present occupies:
his parents lavished hundreds on the tuition of his toes, which have
turned out exceedingly well; and it has been said of these toes, that
they have proved little fortunes to their lucky owner. A Plomb paints
passion with his pumps, and while others have their profession at
their fingers' ends, this very popular Fright has his art at the points
of his toes, which can express all the noblest sentiments that are
capable of being embodied by the human ankle.
It has been sometimes objected to the feet of Aplomb, that they are
destitute of sole; but this is not where the shoe really pinches. In
private life the Fright must be a very estimable man, for he is
evidently impressed with the idea that one good turn deserves
another, inasmuch as after one extraordinary pirouette, he always
indulges in a second.
INELIGIBLE INVESTMENT.
The following extraordinary advertisement appeared in the Morning
Chronicle of Thursday last :-
“ELEPHANT for SALE.-A fine male Elephant, very tame, is just arrived from
Calcutta, and is for sale.”
We anxiously looked to another part of the paper, expecting to find an
announcement of the arrival of Lord ELLENBorough. Perhaps, however,
the advertisement is put out as a feeler, so that either party may make a
bid for the late Governor-General. The Tories have evinced a disposition
not to have him at any price. Whether the tame elephant will submit to
be ignominiously knocked down to the Whigs is nevertheless exceedingly
doubtful. . We suspect he would turn out a very bad lot to any one who
purchased him.
A NEW POSTMASTER GENERAL.
M. Conte, the Directeur of the Poste at Paris, has published a report,
in which he states there is a person in his office who reads 3,000,000
letters every year. Now, if this person can read English only one half as
well, he is worth his weight in gold at St. Martin's-le-grand. Only
imagine, Sir JAMES, what an invaluable co-operator that man would be to
you, who could devour—say 30,000 secrets a day !

LORD WILLIAM LENNOX's
READINGS AND RECITATIONS FROM JOE MILLER.
RiDAY last, Willis's Rooms were crowded to hear
the opening lecture of Lord WILLIAM LENNox,
who, we are happy to learn, proposes to give an
entire reading of Joe MILLER. Nothing could
exceed the curiosity and enthusiasm of the au-
dience. Indeed, when we reflect on the peculiar
reputation which his Lordship has obtained from
his Tuft-Hunter—when the extraordinary con-
tents of that composition are duly considered—we
cease to wonder at the applausive shouts that
yesterday hailed the lecturer's appearance.
His Lordship, having swallowed a little water
from a decanter before him, at once entered upon
his task. He showed himself wonderfully at home
in the antiquarian knowledge of every joke ; began with its birth, and
traced it throughout every part of its literary history—now shewing us
where it had gone to the playhouse, and now where to the bookseller's.
The most effective part, however, of the performance, was his Lordship's
recitations. Into these he seemed to throw his whole soul. His eye
flashed, his voice trembled, his form dilated ; and, indeed, he presented to
the imagination of the beholder a very lively hint of his Lordship's
appearance, when, doubtless, inspired by the composition of the Tuft-
Hunter. Had he only grasped a pair of scissors, the resemblance must
have been perfect.
We cannot follow his Lordship through every jest of the immortal
Millen, but must content ourselves with dwelling on two or three,
recommended for quotation by their brevity. LoRD WILLIAM's first :—
“A man was once carrying a hare along Fleet Street, when DEAN Swift stopt him,
and, in his waggish manner, asked, “Friend, is that your own hair or a wig º'''
LoRD WILLIAM read this with exquisite delicacy. He began the passage
in a light colloquial tone, rising in purpose as he came to DEAN Swift.
His pause between the words “asked ” and “friend,” shewed the student
of the human heart; and the deep, not loud, and absorbing chuckle with
which he rolled out “ or a wig ” caused a sensation much more easily
conceived than described. We proceed to a second example:–
“Two friends once met, one with a very short coat on. “How now, Jack?', said one,
“your coat is much too short for you!”—“That may be,” answered the wag, “but it will
be long enough before I get another.’”
Load William here produced a startling effect. The artistic way with
which he for some time coaxed the joke, until he sent it cracking among
the audience, was—tremendous. Reading the third :—
“GARRick was once passing by, when one chimney-sweeper cried to another, “Jack,
that's a player.”—“Hush l’ cried the second sweep, “you don't know what you may come
to yourself!'"
We have heard much of public recitations, but we never heard any-
thing equal to LoRD WILLIAM's “Hush 1” It went point-blank to the
hearts of his hearers; and the half-jocose, half-moralizing way with which
he gave the reproof of the sweep, did equal honour to the speaker's heart
and head. Our next quotation must be poetical.
“The witty CHARLEs the SEco No having asked Lond Roch Est ER how he would
write his epitaph, the waggish nobleman immediately answered as follows:—
“Here lies our sovereign, CHARLEs the King,
Whose word no man relies on ;
Who never said a foolish thing,
And never did a wise one.""
LoRD WILLIAM's recitation of this was probably his crowning triumph.
His Lordship has evidently exquisite ears for verse. There was a sweet
gravity in his intonation of the first line—a deepening feeling in the
second and third—and a solemnity of manner in his delivery of the fourth,
that took our heart and imagination right away to a place of tombs. Like
the writings of JEREMY TAYLoR, the verse, under the treatment of Lond
William, seemed to smell of the grave. But doubtless the heart of the
speaker was touched by the recollection of the virtuous CHARLEs—the
great progenitor of the illustrious house of LENNox—illustrious in the
field, the senate, and the Betting Ring. This may reasonably account for
the emotion of the reciter.
We are *PW to state that the audience were numerous and more than
respectable. e noticed among the visitors the Duke of CAMBRIDGE,
who seemed to relish the culinary jokes with all the gusto of the House
of Brunswick; Sheriff Moon ; Silk Buckixgham, with his SANcho,
GEORGE Jones; Tom Thumb ; MR. OsbALDiston, of the Victoria, and
others of equal celebrity.
These readings by Lord William present a curious anomaly, when we
think of the deserted condition of our playhouses. Here is a man who,
by his unassisted genius, attracts a large audience to hear the reading of
jokes, when the same things in “new” comedies and farces, with all the
*djuncts of rouge, wig, wardrobe, and scenery, are spoken to empty
benches. Verily, it is a strange public I

COMFORTABLE LODGINGS.
* IND MR. Punch,
I AM a promising, amiable, and rather f.
fine young man, of about five-and-twenty years of
age; but alas ! I have every reason to believe
that there is a horrid conspiracy against my life,
for ever since the Introduction of the Polka into
Great Britain I have undergone a series of tor-
tures that must ultimately cause my premature
death. My occupation being a sedentary one, I
am obliged to be engaged nearly all day in my
study, which is at the back of my family mansion,
and in this hot weather it is very necessary to sit
with the windows open ; the same cause I suppose
induces all my neighbours to adopt the same means of cooling themselves.
Well I that is all right and proper ; but, my dear Punch, in every house
near me there are some four or five very pretty girls: all of these very
pretty girls seem to have §. pianos, and they, one and all, play that
inf-, no, TIIAT Polka. Now, added to all this, six of my sisters have
just come to spend the day with my wife, and they too, have all brought
Polkas; so that I am afraid by four o'clock or thereabout I shall be
defunct—miserably—cruelly—Polka'd to death. Do, Punch, pray do
step forward and use your powerful influence to put a stop to this pre-
sent “Great Plague of London.” There—there it goes again, and
Good Heaven l Balfe's “Marble Halls” (which I hate) has broken
out in Great Ormond Street. I am nearly mad!
Yours, distracted,
BEETHoven WEBER SMITH.
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE.
THE Kensington and Wormwood Scrubs Little Western and No-Junc-
tion Railway remains as per last. A servant of all work has been engaged,
who takes a pride in scouring the wooden sleepers and black-leading the
rails throughout the entire line every Saturday. The clerk is still enjoying
his otium cum dignitate. He seems fully impressed with the truth that
“the post of honour is a private station,” and the Kensington station
being a very private one, the honour of the post is quite undelliable.
We understand that the Directors have it in contemplation not to run
their carriages at any particular hour, but to allow the public to hire a
carriage and an engine for a run up and down the line at so much per
hour. The plan is to be the same as that adopted at livery stables, and a
board is already being painted, announcing, “Neat engines by the day or
hour.” Parties wishing to bring their own coke will be permitted to do
so, and they can have hot water supplied them by the company.

PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER XIII.
FROM A YouNG GENTLEMAN, DESIROUS OF ENTERING THE ARMY,
To his GUARDIAN.
MY DEAR SIR,
In our last conversation, you more than hinted at the
necessity of my making choice of a profession. I have again and
again considered the important subject, and am at length resolved.
Yes; I have made my election—I will become a soldier. I have
looked about me, I trust dispassionately ; I have weighed and
counterweighed all other things with the sword, and found them as
nothing to the glorifying steel. Do not believe, sir, that I am biassed
in my judgment by the outward show and ceremonious parade of
military life; no, sir, although I can well believe that they have a
false influence on the youthful mind, I nevertheless trust that I have
too well benefited by your philosophy to confound the noble profes-
sion of arms with its holiday blazonry—its review-day splendour.
The mere human clod may turn from the plough, beckoned by the
fluttering ribands of the recruiting-sergeant—the clown's heart may,
to his astonishment, beat to the beating sheepskin, and so beguile
him into the ranks—but, sir, I trust that education has taught me a
truer valuation of things, enabling me to consider the profession of a
soldier in its abstract glory, in its naked loveliness. I look only
at the wreath of CAEsan, and care not for the outward splendour
of his legions.
Oh, sir, when I read the career of conquerors, I have a strange
belief that I was born to be a soldier . I feel such a sympathising
throb of heart at the achievements of an A1. Exande R, that
all other pursuits, save that of arms, seem to me poor, frivolous,
and unworthy of the highest dignity of human nature. To me, sol-
diers appear the true lords of the earth; and other men, however
rich, but as mere greasy serfs—creatures with their souls dwelling
darkly in money-bags. The game of war is a pastime for gods, and
man is sublimated by its exercise. And then death—death in the
bed of glory—with a whole country weeping over our ashes is not
that a prospect, sir, to quicken the blood of youth, and intoxicate
the brain with the sweetest, the noblest draughts of ambition 1 And
then, sir, the laurel, flourishing in everlasting green, and circling our
memory for ever !
Nevertheless, should you wish me to delay the purchase of a com-
mission for a few months, I trust you will permit me to visit Germany
this autumn to witness the reviews. It is said that the troops ex-
pected to assemble will be the flower of the world. I know not, too,
how many thousands. What a sublime spectacle ! In their different
uniforms—with their banners, their artillery, and their leaders—
many of them with the history of the last wars cut in scars upon
their bodies 1 I do not think the world can show a nobler sight. So
superhuman in its power—so awful in its beauty
And now, sir, having freely communicated to you my desire to en-
ter the army, permit me to assure you that I shall devote my entire
soul to the study of my duties as a soldier. They have I know their
severity: but have they not also their rewarding sweetness? Yes,
sir, for how delicious must it be—the heat and fury of the battle
over—to solace the wounded, to protect the helpless In those
moments the noblest emotions of our common nature must be
awakened; they must repay the warrior for toil, privation, suffering
unutterable. Yes, sir—to know that in such an hour we are lessen-
ing the anguish of a fellow-creature must for a time elevate us
beyond the common impulses of poor humanity.
Anxiously awaiting your reply—and with it, as I fondly believe,
your consent—
I remain, your affectionate ward,
ARTHUR BAYTwig.
P.S. Do not think, my dear sir, that the opinions of a certain
young lady, who has always declared she would marry no one but
a soldier, have had the least influence upon my determination.
No, sir; not the least, I assure you.
LETTER XIV.
ANSWER OF THE GUARDIAN TO THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
MY DEAR ARTHUR,
I thought more highly of your discrimination. I believed
that you knew me better than to make so foolish a proposition.
My opinions on war and its instruments are, I know, not the opinions
of the world; it would save the world—I am vain enough to think—
much guilt, much misery, if they were so.
You, doubtless, believe your letter the result of an honest en-
| thusiasm; and yet, to my fancy it is nothing more than the folly
of a boy, who, unconscious of his prompter, writes with a fiend
dictating at his elbow. Yes, my boy, a fiend; he is too often
busy among us—one of the vilest and most mischievous demons
of all the brood of wickedness. To be sure, he visits men not in
his own name—oh no he comes to them in the finest clothes
and under the prettiest alias. He is clothed in gay colours—
has yards of gold trimming about him—a fine feather in his cap
—silken flags fluttering over him—music at his heels—and his
lying, swindling name is—Glory. Strip the thing so called, and
how often will you find the abhorred nakedness of a demon. Be
assured of it, fife and drum make the devil's choicest music. He
blows and beats—ſor, being a devil, he can do this at the same time
—and makes the destructive passions of men twist and wriggle in
the hearts of even peaceful folk, and with the magic of his tattoo
drives them on to mischief. You know, people say I have strange,
violent thoughts. Well ! I think every sheep whose skin is turned
into drum-parchment, has been sacrificed not to the gods but devils.
You tell me that you are smitten with glory in the abstract—with
its naked honour. Pooh I like a poor-souled footman, you are
content to take the blows for the fineness of the livery.
You say, that when you read the history of conquerors, you yearn
to become a soldier. Well, I dispute it not ; there have been men
made soldiers by tyranny and wrong, whose memories may, like
the eternal stars, shine down upon us; these men may be envied.
But I, too, have read the lives of conquerors; and, as I live, they
no more tempted me to emulate them, than the reading of the
Newgate Calendar would make me yearn to turn foot-pad or
house-breaker.
At best, soldiers are the evils of the earth. The children of human
wrong, and human weakness. Understand me, I would not have
men ground arms, and, with quaker-like submission, cry “friend” to
the invader. Nevertheless, do not let us prank up a dire necessity
with all sorts of false ornament, and glorify wholesale homicide. You
say war is the pastime of gods. Hom ER tells us as much. And pretty
gods they were who played at the sport 1 In my time, I have known
many men who, for very humbly imitating them in some of their
amusements, have died on the gallows or withered on board the
hulks. I trust the time will come when it will bring as great shame
to men to mimic Mars, as it now deals upon the other sex to imitate
Venus.
You talk glibly enough of the bed of glory. What is it? A battle-field,
with thousands blaspheming in agony about you? Your last moments
sweetened, it may be, with the thought that somewhere on the field
lies a bleeding piece of your handiwork—a poor wretch in the death-
grasp of torture ? Truly, that is a bed of greater glory which is
surrounded by loving hearts—by hands uplifted in deep, yet cheerful
prayer. There are thoughts, too—it is my belief—better, sweeter far
than thoughts of recent slaying, to help the struggling soul from out
its tenement.
You talk, too, of the nation's tears 1 In what museum does the
nation keep her pocket-handkerchiefs? Depend upon it, nations that
love to fight, are not the nations that love to weep. I grant it; many
a fine, simple fellow, has died in the belief of being wept over by his

My dear boy, never sell your life for imaginary drops of water. And
then you rave about laurel—an accursed plant of fire and blood.

the spectacles of truth, there cannot be a sadder, a more rueful

than thousands of men dressed and harnessed, and nicely schooled for
the destruction of their fellow-creatures. All their finery, all their
trappings, are to me but the gimcrackery of the father of wickedness.
In my time, I have seen thousands of soldiers drawn up, with a
bright sky shining above them ; and I have thought them a foul mass

beneficence of heaven But then, I have odd thoughts—strange
opinions.
You say it will be sweet, the battle over, to solace the wounded.
My dear boy, it will be sweeter far not to begin the battle at all. It
may be very humane to apply the salve after you have dealt the
gash,_but surely it would be better wisdom, truer humanity, to
inflict no hurt. And, in time, men will learn this truth ; they are
learning it; and as I would not see you in a profession which I
trust is speedily becoming bankrupt, you will never, with my consent,
purchase into the army.

THE RAILWAY MORAL CLASS BOOK.
BY THE BISHOP OF LONDON.
Morals for the First Class.
The morals prescribed for
this Class are the same on
all days of the week. An
act which is moral on Mon-
days, Tuesdays, Wednes-
days, Thursdays, and Fridays,
is moral also on Sundays.
The reason is, that this class
employs the best tailors,
eats the best food, drinks
the best wines, in short,
lives the best; and lastly
and especially, pays the
highest fare of all the three
Classes. Moreover, being
accustomed to amuse them.
selves all the six days of
the week, it would be cruel
to deprive them of recreation
on the seventh ; and having
little or no business on any
day, they have as much
business to travel on Sun-
day as on any other.
Morals for the Second Class.
It is not, strictly speaking,
uite proper for persons of
this Class to do the same
thing every day; so that a
perfect system of morality
would prohibit them from
Sunday travelling. Many of
them go to Holborn and the
City for their clothes, dine
upon two courses, and can-
not afford Hock, Claret, and
Champagne, or even good
Port an . However,
on the whole, they are pretty
respectable. Thus, for the
transgression, the rigid rule
of right may be relaxed, and
they may permitted to
travel on Sundays; but they
are to understand this per-
mission as a sufferance
merely, and their conduct in
availing themselves of it is by
no means to be approved of.
Morals for the Third Class.
For this Class of people
to travel on Sundays is a
heinous crime. They are
meanly clad, and live upon
a coarse kind of food. Toil
and hardship are their por-
tion during the week, and
enjoyment on the Sunday
would make them discon-
tented with their lot, The
Third Class of railway pas-
sengers is formed of the in-
ferior classes, and not being
respectable, no respect what-
ever should be shown to its
inclinations. Its fare is no-
thing like an atonement for
the crime in question. The
Legislature, therefore, has
acted very improperly in
compelling Sunday trains to
run Third Class carriages;
and the statute, if possible,
should be evaded.
A TESTIMONIAL TO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,
WE really think, now that the Session is over, that a Testimonial ought
to be presented to the Speaker of the House of Commons, as an expression
of public sympathy for his unprecedented sufferings this year; for if it
be true, that there is nothing so fatiguing as having nothing to do, what
must it be to watch six hundred people, night after night, doing nothing
for six months in the year ! We propose that the testimonial consist of
a handsome night-cap, with an air cushion and pillow; a warming-pan, and
a copy of “Sleep at Will,” to enable the Speaker to pass future Sessions
in greater comfort and repose.
THE MINISTERS' HOLIDAY LETTERS.
THE following holiday letter, written in consequence of the
approaching vacation, has been forwarded by SIR Ron ERT PEEL
to his Tamworth constituents, whom he has always regarded as his
political parents:—
“MY DEAR PARENTs,
“I write with much pleasure to let you know that our
vacation will commence next week, when I hope to see you in good
health.
“I think you will be satisfied with my progress, and though I
have not been fortunate enough to get many good marks, I have had
a very few crosses.
“I have had some very hard French lessons in the course of the
half year, and I have got a very difficult one for my holiday task,
but I shall do all I can to beat MAs TER GUIzot.
“I have got on very well with my arithmetic, though at the
beginning of the half year I had a good deal of trouble with compound
fractions. I have thrown off weights and passed measures ; but
I have skipped corn-measure, because of its being so very difficult.
“My geography has given me a good deal of trouble, particularly
India, which I nearly got punished for, through the fault of another
boy named ELLENBorough. But ELLENBorough has been turned
back; and now that he is out of the class, we go on a great deal
better.
“I have not spent all my money, but have got a large surplus;
which MR. BULL, my master, says is much more praiseworthy than
what was done by those naughty boys, MasTER MELBouhn E, MAs-
TER Monte AGLE, and Masteh Russell, who spent all the money
they had, and got into debt very much besides.
“In my drawing, I have done very little; but I have got a good
many pretty designs, and I hope next half year to finish them.
“Our Vacation will end at the usual period; and
“I remain, my dear parents,
“Your affectionate offspring,
“Rob ERT PEEL.”
FROM LORD ABERDEEN.
IN order to show the proficiency he has acquired in French, Loni,
ABEmdeen has written his holiday letter in that language.
“Mes chers Parens,
“Je suis heureur (I am happy) de rous dire (to tell you),
que notre saintes jours (that our holy-days) sont bien près i la main (are
very near at hand), J'ecrit celui ci lettre (I write this letter) en
Francais (in French) en ordre de rous montrer (in order to show you)
comme j'ai obtenu en arant (how I have got on) dans mon Francais (in
my French). J'ai eu, un dur tirage (I have had a hard pull) area
Maitre Guizot (with Masten Guizot) qui a cssayé diaboliquement dur
(who has tried deuced hard) d'oltenir le mieur de moi (to get the better

que je serais un allumette (that I shall be a match) pour lui (for him).
Il n'est pas allant (he is not going) de faire un fou de moi (to make a fool
of me). It me prend pour une jean ane (he takes me for a jackass),
mais je suis rien de l'espèce (but I am nothing of the sort).
“Toujours, mes chers parens (always, my dear parents),
“Votre affectionée soleil (your affectionate son),
“Doyen d'Aber (ABER DEEN).”
FROM SIR JAMES GRAHAM.
“My DEAR PATA AND MAMA,
“I am very glad to tell you that the holidays will begin
next week.
“I am sorry to say that my master, MR. John Bull, is not
pleased with me, and I have been in a great deal of disgrace about
my letters.
“I hope when I go back to school I shall be a better boy, and I
remain,
“My dear Parents,
“Your undutiful, but repentant, child,
“JAMEs GRAHAxi.”
NOTICE OF MOTION.
EARLY in the ensuing Session a return will be moved for, (we believe
by Colonel Sibthorp,) of the number of words eaten by Hon. Members
from the commencement to the conclusion of the present Session.

MIGRATION
THE migration of the Italian Singing Birds from
this country is about a month antecedent to that
of the martins and swallows, but nearly simultaneous
with that of the swifts, or squeakers, to which last-
named genus they thus present an analogy in more
respects than one.
The swallows and martins, previously to their
departure, collect, with much twittering, on the tops
of houses or trees, in large flocks, for the purpose,
apparently, of practising flying before they set out.
The Italian Singing Birds, also, not without much
chattering and twittering, collect themselves, when
about to migrate, in the first-class train of one of
the great railways. This takes them into the pro-
vinces, where they collect something beside them-
selves. Other birds of passage have by this time of
the year abandoned their nests; not so these, who
labour at the feathering of theirs unceasingly.
A brief account of the principal of these interest-
ing warblers will not, perhaps, be unacceptable to
the reader:-
The LABLAche.
This is a very fine bird, not only considered with
reference to the fine feathers, or state of feather,
which he appears in, but, taken altogether, for the
combined power and richness of his song he is un-
rivalled; and his singing, it is worthy of remark, is
much less frequently interfered with by the pip and
other ailments than that of the generality of his tribe.
He is a bird that can sing, and will sing, never re-
quiring any compulsion to make him sing. He is
distinguished by great capacity of chest, exceeded
only by that of an inferior region, and of the upper
story, or head, which has evidently a great dealin it,
to judge from the scope of his abilities. His general
habits may be represented as easy. He may often
be seen sunning himself in Regent Street, or sailing
down Waterloo Place. Birds of this class feed
generally on macaroni, ravioli, and similar kick-
shaws; and their drink is mostly acid and meagre :
but we strongly suspect the individual under con-
sideration of being addicted to beef and pudding, and
doubt if he would object to ale.
THE Gilisi.
Among Italian Singing Birds the female is equally
musical, to say the least, with the male. The song
of the Grisi is remarkable for its variety, strength,
and sweetness. The habits of the Grisi, from what
we have been enabled to glean respecting them, seem
to be those of a bird that contrives, in a considerable
measure, to enjoy its own existence. Whether rising
with the lark is one of them, or not, we do not know,
but we are certain that singing with it is ; for the
- S S---
Grisi may undoubtedly be said to vie with the lark,
OF THE ITALIAN SING ING BIRDS.
---
or even the nightingale, in singing. The Grisi is
evidently a bird of a kind disposition, and susceptible
of affection and attachment; but we should conjecture
that she would be apt to peck if ruffled. The kind
of food best adapted for this very fascinating song-
stress is to be obtained at M. WEREY's.
THE FORNAs ArtI.
The Fornasari, we believe, first visited these shores
in the Spring of 1843. This is a large well-pro-
portioned bird, standing no less high on his own
private supporters or legs, than he does in the esti-
mation of his public supporters. He is remarkable
for a tufted or beard-like appendage to the lower
mandible or chin. His song is much prized, being
considered to be in no sense inferior to that of the
TAMBURIN1; to which, by many indeed, it is pre-
ferred. This bird is occasionally to be seen in
the Quadrant. His habits are not generally known;
but there is no reason to suppose that they are
otherwise than generic ; and it is probable that,
with a good cook, he might be fed and reared with-
out difficulty.
The PERSIANI.
This delightful warbler is very highly esteemed
for the delicacy, flexibility, and mingled ease and
brilliancy of execution which characterise her strain,
which is a term that perhaps we are wrong in
using, as she sings apparently without the slightest
effort. Her principal habit is that of walking in
her sleep, a peculiarity which, as she sings divinely
during this state of somnambulism, has procured her
a great reputation.
THE MARIO,
A very pleasant vocalist. He is now regarded as
an efficient substitute for the Rubini, to whose note,
his own, in point of quality, is somewhat similar.
He differs, however, from the latter bird, in singing,
like a good bullfinch, the airs which he has acquired
without any admixture of certain “native wood-
notes wild” which, however well enough in their
way, are no embellishment to such music as
MozART's. We lately had the pleasure of hearing
him deliver “Il mio tesoro” with very commendable
fidelity. He is in the habit of being frequently
encored; which is the only habit that our knowledge
enables us to ascribe to him.
So highly are these Italian Singing Birds prized
that many of them fetch, on an average, fifty pounds
a night for a mere performance. The sum that would be required to buy one of them up
altogether, would be enormous. Whether it is the length of John Bull's ears, which causes
him to pay so dearly for their gratification, we do not know.
Would he give as much to
relieve the National distress Perhaps : if it were set to music, and sung at the Italian
Opera !

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER VII.-OF ESTATES UPon Condition.
ERE we come to Estates upon
Condition—which are sometimes
estates that are sadly out of con-
dition, and must be considered as
estates that a man may call his
own if he can, but if not he
mustn't.
An estate on a condition implied
by law, is where a man has a
grant of the office of beadle—the
implied condition attached to
which is that he do act as beadle,
or he might be ousted by the
grantor and his heirs for ever.
Thus the Beadle of Golden Square
runs after imaginary boys at least
twice a-day, in order to fulfil the
condition on which his office is
held ; for if he did not make some show of this sort, the cane would
become a mere badge of indolence, rendered more conspicuous by autho-
rity. This would come under the head of non-user, for which any public
office would be forfeited ; and a beadle, having nothing to do, often
walks an applewoman off to the station-house, lest, by non-user, he may be
considered useless, and lose his appointment. |
On the principle of either non-user or mis-user, all forfeitures of estates
proceed—as if a man had taken a house for a few years, and he has the im-
pudence to call it his own freehold and sell it, he incurs a forfeiture of his
lease—“ which is,” says Coke, “the leased punishment that can be given
him.” Felons used to forfeit their estates, but as they often got better
estates in New South Wales, it did not signify. The law was therefore
altered, and the descendants of felons may now take—whatever they can
get, from their worthy ancestors.
An estate on a condition expressed will be understood at once, by
reading the words, and taking them to mean what they say—which in a
legal definition is very i.i.
Some conditions are void :—1st. If they are impossible, as if an estate
be given to Lord Brough AM, on condition that he keeps himself out of
mischief. This would be clearly an impossible condition, and BRough AM
would have the estate. Here the law is at variance with its general
principle, for while it requires impossibilities in many cases, it doth in
this instance set its face against them. 2ndly. A condition is void if it is
against the law. As, if an estate be granted to B., on condition that he
do stick a bill on the gate of Buckingham Palace—this condition would be
void, and B. need not stick the bill, but he would take the freehold.
Some estates on condition are held in pledge, as where a man borrows
£200, and grants an estate of £20 a year till it is paid, after which the
estate is at an end—and this is called a Welsh mortgage. Why it should be
called Welsh is a puzzler, for it has nothing Welsh about it, any more than
a Welsh Wig or a Welsh Rabbit. Next comes a mortgage—mortgage, or
dead pledge—called dead, because the estate is dead to the mortgagor if he
does not look alive and pay off his mortgage in good time. A mortgagor
has, however, the equity of redemption, which is the privilege of taking
his estate out of pawn, by paying up the principal and interest at any
time within twenty years after the mortgagee has taken possession ; so
that mortgagee is kept for twenty years in a precious state of uncertainty
as to whether he shall say “Mine own is not mine own,” which is ex-
tremely possible.
The other estates on condition are estates by statute merchant, statute
staple, and elegit. The two former are intended to benefit commerce;
but as they are nearly obsolete, we leave it to commerce to make what it
can of them. An estate by elegit is where a plaintiff occupies and enjoys
half the defendant's lands and tenements, as if defendant has a two-stall
stable, and plaintiff turns a horse into one of the stalls; or if the former
has a lot of chickens, and the latter takes by elegit every alternate egg
that may be laid in the poultry-yard. This troublesome sort of estate
may be ended by the payment of the debt that gives rise to it. These
estates are chattels and no freehold, so they go to the executor instead of
to the heir, though, by a little alteration in the spelling, these estates may be
said to go to the heir or air, for property of all kinds will vanish in tenues
awras, when the lawyers once get a hand in it.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
Tow Pithey, the juvenile pet of Leicester Square, undertook for a
trifling wager to knock at four doors, ring three bells, get up behind two
carriages, and leap over six street posts within a quarter of an hour. He
got through the knocking very cleverly, and had proceeded as far as the
second ring, when the police interrupted the sport by carrying him off to
the Station House.

MUSIC FOR RAILWAYS.
We understand that the Electro-Telegraph is to be further improved
by the tuning of the wires on the same principle as the guitar or fiddle-
string. A celebrated composer has been requested to furnish a series of
airs, so that the correspondence kept up between the stations may be of
a musical character.
We have much pleasure in giving our aid to this admirable idea by
writing some of the poetry, which is quite at the service of the Great
Western Railway, if paid for by the Line, that is to say, if the Line will
give a fair price for it.
The following is intended as a duet between the Kensington and the
Great Western Railways:—

But some day ! but some day ! but some day !

THE WARNER INVENTION.
The excitement occasioned by the bare possibility of CAPTAIN WARNER
getting a good sum for blowing up the British navy, has set all the smail
maritime geniuses to work, and offers are pouring in upon the Treasury
from all directions to shiver ships to atoms at reduced prices.
A civil engineer at Jersey has written up to town to say he shall be
very happy to blow-up something small upon very moderate terms—and
he proposes to smash a barge for 120l., so that, we presume, he would
annihilate skiffs and wherries at proportionately low charges.
If money is to be really given to these explosive gentlemen, Punch
does not see why he should not have his chance, and he therefore proposes
to blow-up that crazy old funny—Brougham,_for any sum that the
achievement may be thought entitled to. Punch is aware that the diffi-
culty about placing confidence in CAPTAIN WARNER's blowing-up arose
from the suspicion that there was a communication between the blower
and the blowee—a doubt which could not arise in the case of Punch and
the old funny Brougham.

The following is a faithful copy of the lithographed circular the Duke

tions most thankfully received. State secrets bought up in any quantity,
and matrimonial offers answered per return of post.

THE BURNS” FESTIVAL.—“REPENTANT* SCOTLAND.
August 6, Banks of the Doon.
To pay, Scotland did penance for past coldness of heart, and avarice of pocket. She had
degraded her poet into an exciseman; she had snatched Robert Bunns
-- from the sickle and the plough,
To gauge ale-firkins,”
and finally saw him on his death-bed agonised by a most trumpery debt, without once drawing
her purse-strings.-Well, to-day
“Caledonia stern and wild,
Meet nurse for a poetic child,”
(albeit her nursing of the Ayrshire ploughman was very much after the fashion of Mrs.
Brown Rigg)—to-day, repentant Caledonia confessed her sins of
neglect and selfishness, and by the Banks of Doon, supplicated for-
giveness of the ghost of Robert Burns. And was her penitence
genuine? Did she really feel the birth of gratitude to the sublimating
spirit of Poetry And if another Burns—yea, or a lesser genius–
were to manifest himself, would she honour him living, or would
she again suffer him to be—
“oppressed with grief, oppressed with care,
A burden more than he could bear?”
And after he had passed away some fifty years from this earth, N
…-
--
&
would she then rend her
garments and cast ashes
\ - on her head, and wail and
wring her hands in most theatrical remorse for
- V the callousness of her neglect? Well, it is a
hard question; we cannot satisfactorily answer
it; but we beg to refer the curious to Thom,
the living poet of Inverary. He, doubtless,
can give testimony of the tenderness of Scot-
land; can show the sincerity of her repentance
for past omissions, by the activity of her sympathies towards
present suffering. For, of course, Scotland would hardly play the
hypocrite to the Shade of Burns, whilst Thom—a man of exquisite
powers—was ground to the earth by the tyranny of want. No,
no ; Scotland on this sixth of August, comes, a true penitent, to the
Banks of Doon, and she has therefore first visited the poet of
Inverary with sympathising gladness.
Punch—he says it with all manly modesty—has ever been dis-
tinguished for the exclusiveness of his intelligence. Whenever he
has condescended to chronicle the events of the times, he has
generally contrived to enrich his narrative with incidents which
have altogether escaped the attention of his soberer contempo-
raries; nay, he has often reported circumstances wholly unknown
to the actors thereof. Nevertheless, by so doing, he has endea-
voured to deliver himself in the true spirit—if truly developed—

of the event. If in his reports he narrates not precisely what really
happened, but what—tested by the thing professed—ought to have taken
place, he may certainly violate historic fidelity, but he submits that
the fiction may have its moral utility. With this little preface, PUNCH
begins his brief report of the late doings at the Banks of the Doon.
Scotland is tremendously in earnest in all that relates to BURNs ;
in earnest alike in her gratitude and her penitence. This is strongly
and most touchingly shewn even in the grave of Bunns's father; the
rustic patriarch of “the big ha' Bible,” embalmed by his immortal
son in verse beating with the pulses of the human heart. The grave
is in “Auld Alloway's" haunted kirk-yard : and, gentle reader, if
any one returning therefrom tell you that the said grave was on the
6th of August a trodden mass of mud, with nothing to protect it—
nothing save a low stone—to distinguish it from the graves around,+
then, reader, confound the traducer of Scotland, by declaring to him—
(on the authority of the pilgrim PUNch)—that the grave of BURNs's
father is rêverently cared for; is held as precious dust, dear to the
heart and memory of Scotland, as a part of him who is now her espe-
cial glory ! Is it likely that, at the time thousands and thousands
were pouring in procession past Alloway Church, to pay heart-homage
to the memory of BURNs, that the grave of his father should be a
mere heap of mire—so much unregarded muck No ; it was beau-
tifully planted about : every rustic care was bestowed upon it; the
national veneration for the son was manifested even in the dust of the
sire I
At intervals throughout the day the rain poured steadily down—
and then the sun flickered out, and veiled himself again, as though
refusing to shine upon the tardy penitence of Scotland. However,
the procession—and to our fancy there was nothing in all the glories
of the Eglintoun show equal to the Ayrshire ploughmen in their
homely plaid—the procession, made up of various bodies, passed the
cottage in which BURNs was born, vailing their banners and doffing
their caps, as they looked upon the hovel made glorious by the im-
mortal mind that dawned there. There was a false legend that this
house was turned into a dram-shop ; a way-side hut for the sale of
whiskey ; that the room in which Bunns was born was suffered to
remain a dirty, fetid nook, fit for the stying of a hog. All base
calumny against the enthusiasm of Scotland 1 No : the cottage has
been bought by the Township of Ayr : has been properly repaired,
and is shown to pilgrims by an honest matron, who keeps the cottage
beautifully clean and neat; as, indeed, Scotch cottages peculiarly
are. It is said that the Town of Ayr will, in a short time, surround
the cottage with a silver rail.
As the procession passed over the Doon, an incident occurred—
suggestive of a strange freak. The Box-makers of Mauchline carried
an enormous thistle, under which was well inscribed :—
“I turned aside my weeding hook
And spared the symbol dear.”
PRofesson WILson—caustic enthusiast !—seized the thistle, and
plucking a piece of it, pressed it to his bosom ; the Count Ess of
Eglinto UN and others did the same. Whereupon Punch could
not but think that the act was satirically typical of the treatment of
BURNs by Scotland; for truly, did she not press her living poet to
her beating heart, even as men press a thistle—shrinkingly, cautiously
The procession passed into a field, where a large temporary build-
ing was erected, capable of dining the whole dining population of
Scotland; that is, all of the enthusiasts willing, in honour of BURNs, to
pay the sum of fifteen shillings per mouth for a piece of cold tongue,
a plate of gooseberries almost ripe, and a pint of some mystery,
calling itself Sherry. There was, however, a deep meaning in the
sum of fifteen shillings. It was an unerring test of the sincerity of
the heart through the breeches pocket.
Down poured the rain as about a thousand persons sat down to
affect to eat a dinner; but the pavilion was water-proof, and they ate
and were dry. But how went it with the thousands who composed
the procession, and who could not pay fifteen shillings? Why,
gentle reader, they were all fed at the EARL of Eglintoun's cost ;
for is it likely that the EARL–the same princely nobleman who
expended a tolerable fortune upon knights and squires for three days
only—would stint on such a national occasion ? Oh no 1 all the pro-
cession folks were feasted at some house, though, after the most
industrious search, Punch could not discover the sign.
The speeches were very excellent. LoRD EGLINtoun delivered
himself with such ſervour on the genius of BURNs, that, sure we
are, he would have willingly exchanged his rank and possessions for
the fame of the Ayrshire Ploughman. Professor Wilson's speech
had one fault—it was too short;-“brief as the lightning in the
collied night;” and the hearers could not repress the expression of,
their disappointment at this; for they now and then scraped the
floor with their feet, and rattled their knives and forks. The speech,
however brief as it was, was beautiful. The Professor did not,
before the sons of BURNs, exhume their father to read a lecture on
his moral diseases; certainly not. He was content, (or might have
been,) to expatiate solely on the genius of the Bard, and on the
immortal wealth that he had bequeathed to all generations of his
kind. The Professor knew that it was his business to deal only with
the Poet—for the Man Burns had already answered to his God.
The sons of BURNs were present; so was his sister, with her
daughters. It was delightful to behold them. The sons of BURNs
had already made good their claim to the high nature of their father
in their conduct to his widowed sister, left struggling with the worst
necessities; and had, of course, assisted their helpless aunt, and her
cordial, fine-hearted daughters. Rob ERT BURNs, late of Somerset
House, and MAJon and Colon E1. BURNs—who could doubt it?—had
acted worthy of their name, imperishable from its associations with
all that is lofty of mind, and profound of heart.
The hospitality of Scotland is proverbial. Nothing could exceed
the kindness of the committee who arranged the festival, to those
who were not Scotchmen. Indeed, it was sufficient to have the
meanest title from English letters, to receive from the Scotch gentle-
men in authority on the occasion attentions the most delicate and
cordial. Many English writers had been invited, but sent excuses
of some sort. Perhaps, with the intuitive forecast of genius, they
thought that, if they came, they would be left to shift for themselves,
and stayed at home accordingly.
The proceedings of the day were wound up by the EARL of Egil N-
Toux, who proposed the health of MR. Robert CHAMBEns, which
was drunk with an enthusiasm truly national. And well did Mn.
CHAMBERs merit the distinction. For it was he who first sought out
the suffering sister of Robert Bunns ; it was he who brought a
tardy blush into the cold face of Scotland for her neglect of one dear
to her dead poet—BURNs' aged sister, saved only from the direst
want by the needle of her sempstress daughters. Truly, indeed, did
the EARL of Eglintoun say (or might have said) that it was to the
active kindness of MR. Robert CHAMBERs that Scotland was spared
the crowning shame—God knows, the needless ignominy—of the
misery of the widow Begg and her children—the sister and the
nieces of Rob ERT BURNs.
The festival will be long remembered in Scotland. Certain we
are, that no Englishman present can ever forget it.
That everything may be in accordance with the genial spirit that
begot the festival, Punch understands that the wood composing the
temporary Pavilion will be divided amongst the poor of Ayr ; and that
the thousands of yards of calico which covered ceiling, seats, and tables,
will be made into “cutty sarks” for those who may need them.
“FULL INSIDE.”
A little book is just published under the title of the “Cnotchi r
SAMPLE.R.” We have been told it is illustrated with a frontispiece of
Lord BRough AM's head.
PROFESSOR: WILSON'S NEW WORK.
Several volumes have been published of The Beauties of Burns. We
understand that the Professor has a book in hand to be called The Faults
of Burns. He proposes (with singular taste) to dedicate the work to the
Poet's sons.
The Phil OSOPHER'S STONE.
THERE is a “Club Des INVENTEURs” just established at Paris, for the
purpose of encouraging discoveries. Let us propose that the first premium
he awarded to the person who discovers an article in the French press
that is written with the least good feeling towards England.

TRAV E L L | N G NOT ES
BY OUR FAT CONTRIBUTOR.
I was not led to prison, as might have been expected. I was only
conducted to a corner of the room, where was an official with large
mustachios and a conical cap. Eyeing me with lowering brows, the
following dialogue took place between me and this myrmidon of
tyrants:—
Man in the Cap—“Monsieur, votre passeport.”
Fat Contributor—“Monsieur, je n'en ai pas.”
Mº in the Cap—“Alors, Monsieur, vous pourrez passer a votre
hôtel.”
Fat Contributor—“Bonjour, Monsieur” (ici le Gros Rédacteur tire
wn profond coup de chapeau).
Man in the Cap—“Monsieur, je vous salue.”
We separated. I want to know how long Britons are to be sub-
jected to such grinding oppression
We went then to our hotel—the Hôtel des Bains. We were so
foolish as to order Champagne for dinner. It is the worst Champagne
I ever drank in my life: worse than Champagne at Vauxhall—worse
than used to be supplied by a wine-merchant at the University—
worse even than the Bordeaux provided in the Hôtel des Bains.
Good Heavens ! is it for this I am come abroad Î
Is it for this To drink bad wine—to eat fried soles as tough as
my shoe—to have my nerves agitated about a passport—and, by way
of a second course, to be served with flabby raw mutton-chops 1
Away ! I can get these in Chancery Lane. Is there not such a place
as Greenwich in the world; and am I come two hundred miles for
such an iniquitous dinner as this 1
I thought of going back again. Why did I come away? If there
had been a gig at the door that instant to carry me to my native
country, I would have jumped in. But there is no hope. Look out
of the window, miserable man, and see you are a stranger in a foreign
land. There is an alehouse opposite, with “HIER v Eaxoopt MAN
Tn AN KEN” over the porch. A woman is standing before me —a
woman in wooden shoes. She had a Belgic child at her neck,
another at her side in little wooden shoekins.
To them approached their father—a mariner—he kisses his
wife, he kisses his children, and what does he do next? Why he wipes
the nose of the eldest child, and then the fond father wipes the nose

of the youngest child. You see his attitude—his portrait. You
cannot see his child's face because ’tis hidden in the folds of the
puternal handkerchief.
Fancy its expression of gratitude ye kind souls who read this. I
am afat man, but somehow that touch of nature pleased me. It went
to the heart through the nose. Ah! happy children, sua si bona nºrint ;
if they did but know their luck! They have a kind father to tend
them now, and defend their delicate faces from the storms of life. I
am alone in the world—sad and lonely. I have nobody to blow my
nose. There are others yet more wretched, who must steal the hand-
kerchief with which they perform the operation.
I could bear that feeling of loneliness no longer. Away let us
hasten on the dyke to enjoy the pleasures of the place. All Ostend
is there, sitting before the Restaurant, and sipping ices as the sun
descends into the western wave.
Look at his round disc as it sinks into the blushing waters —look,
too, at that fat woman bathing—as round as the sun. She wears a
brown dressing-gown—two bathers give her each a hand—she
advances backwards towards the coming wave, and as it reaches her
—plop ! she sits down in it.
She emerges, puffing, wheezing, and shaking herself. She retires,
creeping up the steps of the bathing machine. She is succeeded by
other stout nymphs, disporting in the waves. For hours and hours
the Ostenders look on at this enchanting sight.
The Ostend oyster is famous in Paris, and the joy of the gorman-
dizer. Our good-natured neighbours would not enjoy them, perhaps,
did they know of what country these oysters are natives.
At Ostend they are called English Oysters. Yes; they are born upon
the shores of Albion. They are brought to Belgium young, and
educated there. Poor molluscous exiles they never see their
country again.
We rose at four, to be ready for the train. A ruffianly boots (by
what base name they denominate the wretch in this country I know
not) was pacing the corridors at half-past two.
Why the deuce will we get up so confoundedly early on a journey
Why do we persist in making ourselves miserable t—depriving our
souls of sleep, scuffling through our blessed meals, that we may be
early on the road Is not the sight of a good comfortable breakfast
more lovely than any landscape in any country? And what turn in
the prospect is so charming as the turn in a clean, snug bed, and
another snooze of half an hour?
This alone is worth a guinea of any man's money. If you are
going to travel, never lose your natural rest for anything. The pro-
spect that you want to see will be there next day. You can't see an
object fairly unless you have had your natural sleep. A woman in
curl-papers, a man unshorn, are not fit to examine a landscape. An
empty stomach makes blank eyes. If you would enjoy exterior
objects well, dear friend, let your inner man be comfortable.
Above all, young traveller, take my advice and never, nerer, be such
a fool as to go up a mountain, a tower, or a steeple. I have tried
it. Men still ascend eminences to this day, and, descending, say they
have been delighted. But it is a lie. They have been miserable the
whole day. Keep you down: and have breakfast while the asinine
hunters after the picturesque go braying up the hill.
It is a broiling day. Some arduous fellow-countrymen, now that
we have arrived, think of mounting the tower of
ANTWERP.
Let you and me rather remain in the cool Cathedral, and look at
the pictures there, painted by the gentleman whom Lady London-
DERRY calls REuBEN.
We examined these works of art at our leisure. We thought to
ourselves what a privilege it is to be allowed to look at the works of
Reuben (or any other painter) after the nobility have gazed on
them “What did the Noble Marquis think about Reuben " we
mentally inquired—it would be a comfort to know his opinion : and
that of the respected aristocracy in general.

BIRDS OF A FEATHER.
SIR JAMEs Graham being on his legs—if it can properly be said that he
has still a leg to stand upon—remarked the other evening, in the House
of Commons, on the question of Medical Reform, that
“He now approached the subject of Quackery.”—
A delicate subject for the Home Secretary to handle; and delicately,
indeed, does he handle it. He “approached” it—for the first time, of
course. It was something quite new to him in principle, and, a fortiori,
in practice. Behold how reverently he “approached” it.
“When they considered with what tenacity men clung to life under every variety of
circumstances, it was not to be wondered at that, at the period of illness, the person
labouring under what he conceived to be a mortal malady should fly (if he could obtain
relief from no other quarter) to the quack for assistance.”
Exactly so. The country labouring under what it conceived to be a
mortal malady, flew, unable to obtain relief from PRofessor Melbour NE,
to MEssRs. Peel & Co. However, SIR JAMES GRAHAM might have spoken
a little more to the purpose : let us speak for him.
“When they considered how large a revenue was derived by Govern-
ment from the duty on quack medicines, although such medicines,
generally, were either useless or mischievous, it was not to be wondered
at that Ministers should uphold quackery.”
But moreover, continued SIR JAMEs,
“In the act of being cheated, the person so imposed upon often felt a great pleasure,
“For sure the pleasure is as great
In being cheated, as to cheat.”
We wonder which enjoys the greater pleasure just now ; the Nation,
or the Ministry SIR JAMEs GRAHAM seems to express himself very feel-
ingly. Does he speak from reminiscence of his own sensations “in the act
of being cheated " Did he ever consult a mesmerist fee a homoeopathic
doctor? or buy a box of vegetable pills and has he had personal experi-
ence of the “great pleasure” felt in being “so imposed upon ” Be
that as it may, the Right Honourable Baronet declared that—
“It was not his intention, however, to attempt to suppress quackery by introducing
new statutes.”
The gentleness with which SIR JAMES GRAHAM “approaches" the sub-
ject of quackery, is equalled only by the quietness with which he shirks
it. No marvel. He admirably appreciates the nature of the “house he
lives in ;” and accordingly, with judgment, abstains from throwing stones.
Destitute, indeed, must that brain be of the organ of comparison, which
fails to perceive that the Cabinet is the Political College of Health, with
Sur Robert PEEL for the Hygeist, and the Income-tax for the universal
medicine. How many more doses of that bitter panacea are we to
swallow :
ANOTHER TAHITI ON THE THAMEs.
T the very time Tahiti was being
a bone of contention
abroad, the Thames was
almost set on fire by the
flame of discord at home.
The affair at the Society
Islands has founda parallel
in a series of proceedings
at the Eel-pie Islands,
where a sort of QUEEN
PoMARE has long held
peaceful dominion in the
person of a respectable
landlady.
It appears that a party
of Frenchmen landed a
little while ago on the Eel-
pie, and endeavoured to
make themselves masters
of the island. The Twicken-
ham policeman, who acts as
a sort of chargé d'affaires,
inerely watched the pro-
ceedings without taking any
part in them, but he report-
ed what was going on from
time to time to the seat of
government at the station-
house. The civic consul,
who acts as British resident to look after the swans belonging to the
corporation, kept a jealous eye on all that was being done, but observed
for some time the strictest neutrality.
A little while after lamplight the Frenchmen became exceedingly
noisy, and a shot was fired from a pea-shooter, which shivered to atoms
the glass of a clock, and stopped the minute hand, so that the inhabitants
were prevented from ascertaining the hour.
A scene of riot then ensued, the French were in a state of fierce
intoxication, and the landlady, the Pomare of the Eel-pies, screamed for
help, upon which the Frenchmen offered their assistance, and at once
proclaimed a French protectorate.
Poor Pomare fled for succour to the only British vessel, which
happened to be a coal-barge ; for it will hardly be believed that such has
been the apathy of the government, there was not even a steamer on the
station.
The French, then finding themselves masters of the island, began to
insult the helpless natives, and the civic consul having advised resistance,
was at once seized and shut up in a small boat-house, where he was kept
a prisoner until CAPTAIN Snooks, of the Vivid, having arrived, demanded
his release in the name of the Civic Government.
MRs. Pomare remains on board the coal-barge, where she bears her
misfortunes with becoming dignity.
The following scene in the Twickenham Vestry will throw some further
light on this affair, which it is hoped may be yet arranged satisfactorily :—
MR. Swaddles, seeing the Churchwarden in his place, would ask if
there was any truth in the despatches that had been laid upon the table
from the Eel-pie Islands ! (Hear.)
THE CHURChwardEN said that advices had certainly been received
which had caused some embarrassment; but in the present state of affairs
he was unprepared to say anything. -
MR. Swaddles would only ask whether it was true that the only force
we had at the Eel-pie was a coal-barge (Hear.)
The ChurchwARDEN replied it was true that a coal-barge was at one
time our only force, but a punt had since been sent out, and a wherry of
observation had been commissioned for the Eel-pie service. (Cheers.)
MR. Swaddles was of opinion that there should have been a steamer on
the spot. It was wilful negligence to leave the Eel-pie exposed to the
chances of surprise. The island might be sacked in a few hours; and if
that were done, what was to prevent Twickenham falling into the jaws ºf
the foreigner (Hear, hear, hear.)
THE CHURCHwanpen thought that if it became a question of jaw, there
could be no fear while the Westry could boast of the honourable member's
countenance. (A laugh.)
The subject here dropped, and the Westry adjourned.

CAPTAIN PRUDENCE.
y the version given in the Emancipation de

learn that the French vessel, the Phaëton,
“Passed, along the coast on her return, throwing
shells on all the houses within her reach.”

Whilst, however, pursuing this generous
mode of warfare, the heroes of the Phaëton–
“Perceived with astonishment two intrenchments,

who appeared to command them, came to the shore to
challenge a landing. Prudence commanded that nothing

was throwing shells on the houses of the defenceless Tahitians, CAPTAIN
PRUDENce was taking a nap in his hammock; the vessel being under
the direction of Lieutenant CRUELTY.
CAPTAIN PRUDENCE, we find, was—
“Satisfied with sending them some broadsides, which appeared not to frighten them,
as they did not stir.”
Much, we apprehend, to the astonishment of CAPTAIN PRudence, who,
no doubt, under similar circumstances, would have run away as fast as
his legs could carry him.

GONE TO THE DOGS.
The papers have informed us of the death and burial of Yeos, a grey-
hound to which her Majesty and PRInce Albert were both “greatly
attached.” The death of the beast appears to have been so sudden, that
the Queen suspected foul play, and MR. BRown, of Windsor, who is, it
seems, the royal dog doctor, was immediately sent for, that a post mortem
examination might take place immediately. Several of the servants gave
evidence at the inquest. The following extracts will show how carefully
the investigation was conducted.
“SARAH Schub, the scullery maid, was now brought in, and cautioned
by MR. BRown that her testimony would be taken down, and might be
used elsewhere against her. Her examination then proceeded.—Knew
the dog Yeos. Saw her last alive poking her nose into a dish of sweet-
breads on the pantry dresser. The dog was allowed to go everywhere by
HER MAJesty's command, and was not to be thwarted in anything. The
dog was a very great favourite with the Queen and PRince ALBERT.
Wituess was in the habit of feeding YEos: gave her a páté de foie gras
the day before her death.
appetite.
y PRINCE ALBERT-Did you make him too rishe by too musli of de
nastie salt buttare :
The witness replied distinctly that fresh butter had been used.
PRINCE ALBERT.-Can you sware dat?
WITNEss.-I can. (Great sensation).
Dr. PRAtoRius, who had been watching the case on the part of PRInca
Albert, thought it would be useless to carry the criminal part of the
matter further. He (DR. PRAEToRIUs) would candidly admit he had no
stronger evidence to offer. “
MR. Brown.—Then I suppose, Doctor, you withdraw from the inquiry
DR, PRAEToRius.—Certainly, unless you think there is enough for a
remand. In the case of the MARquise DE BRINvilliens, which a good deal
resembles the present, a remand was allowed. Or to come to later
times, if we are guided by the rule in the prosecution of MADAME
LAFFARGE- -
MR. Brown (interrupting)—No, Doctor, I think we must not do that.
The surgeon then, assuming the office of coroner, proceeded to sum up
as follows:–This affair was apparently involved in a good deal of doubt,
until this inquisition was held. The deceased (weeping) might have been
poisoned, or might not, and here the difficulty comes in to determine
whether he was or wasn't. On a post-mortem examination, there was a
good deal of vascular inflammation about the coats of the nose, and I
have no doubt the affair of the sweet-bread, which was possibly very
highly peppered, had something to do with these appearances. The
pulse had, of course, stopped ; but, as far as I could judge from cir-
cumstances, I should say it had been pretty regular. The ears were
perfectly healthy, and the tail appeared to have been recently wagged,
showing that there could have been nothing very wrong in that quarter.
The conclusion at which I arrive is, that YEos came to his death from
old age, or, rather, by the lapse of time; and a deodand is therefore
imposed on the kitchen clock, which was rather fast on the day of the
dog's death, and might have accelerated his demise.
This verdict having been regularly entered, the inquest was broken up,
and the scullery-maid set at liberty.
She seemed in good spirits, and ate it with
$tijolastic Intelligence.
We have been requested to insert the following intimation to Parents
and Guardians:—
The Misses WHALEbone take in a select number of young ladies to
board, wash, and educate, at Twenty Guineas per annum. A coal mer-
chant's daughter might be received on terms of mutual accommodation;
the usual branches being considered as an equivalent for the best Walls'-
end coals.
The Misses Whalebone would be glad to meet with a butcher who
would place a young lady under their care, and take out the amount of meat
in the polite accomplishments. A young greengrocer might also be finished
in the piano, as a compensation for the potatoes required for the use of the
establishment. There is also an opportunity for a milkman to place a young
lady, who may dance out the milk score, at the rate of 84 quarts for six
lessons. There is still a vacancy for a parlour boarder; and any landlord
having a large house might arrange to receive the rent, in the shape of
lodging for one of his daughters, who could receive her board and educa-
tion on the usual terms.
N. B.-An assistant is required to superintend the school-room in the
absence of the principals, and who would be expected to look upon her
tuition in those branches she may be deficient in, as a compensation for her
general services.
A CHANCE LOST.
Mr. Punch, in respectfully congratulating his Royal Highness PRINcs
Albent upon the birth of his royal son, cannot but point out with a
mournful satisfaction a suggestion which was offered to the Government
by MR. Punch himself. - -
MR. Punch insinuated (as well as the delicacy of the august subject
permitted), the propriety that her Majesty should visit Ireland, and that
an Irish Prince should be born there.

have been born in Dublin on the birthday of DANIEL O'Connell.

–
THE BIRTH OF THE PRINCE,
-
The very early and unfashionable hour at which her MAJEsty mappened
to be confined, caused a tremendous commotion among the Ministers.
The intelligence reached town at a few minutes after six ; and a Treasury
Messenger was pulling away at SIR Robert PEEL's area-bell by half-past;
while a policeman was furiously kicking at Lord Lyndhurst's door by
five-and-twenty minutes to seven. The Premier, who was the first to
hear the noise, popped his head out of his bedroom window, and ascer-
tained the cause of his rest having been disturbed. LoRr ...rndhurst,
who had laid down with his clothes on, in expectation of the event, was
soon on his way to the station of the Great Western ; while the Bishop of
London, in St. James's-square, hearing a terrific tattoo at his knocker,
turned round upon his pillow, and half muttering, “ Humph 1 another
party from The Caff. DE L'EURope,” was presently locked once more in
the arms of Morpheus. The Duke of Wellington was roused by his valet
with the intelligence, and merely replied, “Yes—yes. There's plenty of
time: these matters always take time !” after which he went through
his customary toilette without any particular haste. The EARL of Liver-
pool, to whom the news came last, would not believe the messenger, and
took it cool; while Lord WHARNcliffe got hold of a blunt razor, and lost
three-quarters of an hour in a desperate effort to shave himself.
The scene at the station at Paddington was very amusing. EARL
Delawane was the first who reached the spot, and he waited nearly half an
hour before he ventured to order a special train on his own responsibility.
Ho was subsequently joined by Lord Lyndhurst, SiR JAMEs GRAHAM,
and two others, who thinking he had ordered a special train, omitted to do
so, and, after waiting for some time, inquiries were made, and the mistake
having been found out, it was unanimously declared to have been “very
stupid of DELAware.” They were no sooner off than PEEL and Stanley
came rushing breathlessly into the office, and ordered “special trains for
two,” which were taken and paid for ; but the regular train having gone
on first, the special train was compelled to follow at a very sober pace to
the Slough station. The Duke of Wellington arrived next, and did
not find out how wrong he had been in his calculation, and how little he
knew about these matters till he got to Slough, when he found no carriage
waiting for him, and he was compelled to jump into a hack fly, exclaiming,
“Onwards, onwards! Charge, forward–charge, charge l’” an injunction
he found had not been forgotten when he paid the bill furnished to him.
LoRD WHARNcliff E, who had waited to shave, and the EARL of Liver-
pool came on leisurely enough by the regular train, their lordships not
having thought it worth while to pay for a special one.
A tremendous deal of quizzing took place on the return home at the
expense of the Bishop of London, who was leisurely walking up from the
station to Windsor Castle, when all the Cabinet Ministers were coming
back again. The Bishop felt so ashamed at being so late. that he would
not show his face at the Castle, and was easily persuaded to join the
others to go back altogether ; so that, with the jokes at the Bishop's
expense, the Ministers made up a very jolly party for the journey home
again.
As sure (and slow) as a Gun.
The news of the birth of the young Prince was known at Edinburgh at
twelve o'clock at noon, and many unthinking ladies expected an immediate
salute from the Castle. Scotch cannon, however, take time to deliberate :
no salute was fired. It, however, being customary to gunpowder new-born
princes, the guns of the Castle called a meeting, with Mons Meg in the
Chair when it was determined that a salute should be given—the next
day/
THE GREAT BRITAIN STEAM Ship.
A GENTLEMAN has offered to get this vessel out of the dock at Bristol.
We don't see how this is to be done; but Punch will have the greatest
pleasure in rigging it—by running his own peculiar rigs upon the majestic
vessel.
“'TIS DISTANCE LENDS ENCHANTMENT, &c.”
We propose that CAPTAIN WARNER be allowed to try the virtues of his
“long range” on the “MAuvais” Comet, as being the object furthest off;
or, as the Insurance Offices might object to this, what does SIR Robert
Peel say to the Captain being allowed to have a shy at the Repeal of the
Income tax? It is the most remote object any “long range” could reach ;
and, if “CAPTAIN WARNER." can only bring it down, we are sure the
nation will willingly award him the 400,000l, he modestly asks for the
experiment.
IDaniel the IDrainer.
IRELAND, they say, requires, for the development of her resources, a
thorough drainage. The Repeal Rent of MR. Daniel O'Connell is stated
by the Dublin Evening Mail as averaging from 50,000l. to 60,000l. a year
How can Ireland be drained more effectually

THE “ GLORIOUS FOURTH OF JULY ºn AT
PHILADELPHIA.
account has reached us from our (native) American correspondent of
the rejoicings which took place at Philadelphia on the fourth of last July;
the anniversary of that independence which, our correspondent observes,
“his forefathers wrested from the proud Britishers, after having licked
them with an elegance unparalleled in history.”
The Philadelphians appear to have celebrated this day with uncommon
splendour; which our correspondent ascribes to the circumstance that
they had a double triumph to commemorate; for, as their ancestors,
formerly, had burst their bonds in general, so they, recently, had cancelled
their own in particular.
We omit all notice of such festivities as are the common attendants on
a holiday ; and shall record those only which were distinctive of this
special occasion.
Pleasure parties were formed in various parts of the city and its
neighbourhood; also on the Delaware, whereon floated an immense
number of boats, crowded with dense masses of human beings. The
greatest harmony, morally speaking, prevailed ; although, in a physical
sense, this does not seem to have been the case, since patriotic vocifera-
tions, intermingled with the discharge of fire-arms, and the hissing and
popping of squibs and crackers, resounded on every side : added to which,
hundreds of bands were playing, and thousands of people singing, dif-
ferent tunes at once—the national anthem of “Yankee Doodle" prepon-
derating over the rest considerably.
Military and civic processions paraded, at intervals, about the city all
day, halting from time to time in front of the different stores, to partake
of mint-julep and other refreshments. They bore numerous banners,
displaying appropriate legends and devices. The more conspicuous and
generally admired were the following:—
A colossal head of Liberty, painted on an immense sheet of canvas,
her cap adorned with a huge feather; the word “Repudiation 1’’ in
bronze characters, being inscribed thereon.
A black flag, with a skull and cross-bones depicted on it, and “No
Liquidation 1" in large capitals, underneath the same.
A standard, exhibiting an allegorical figure in a garment of drab,
meant as a representation of Pennsylvania, one hand clutching a bag of
dollars, marked, “Loan 1" the other derisively applied, with a peculiar
gesture, to the nose.
Other flags, banners, and placards, of various sizes, stencilled, and
ainted in different colours, with the sentences, “Wr NEveR Will.
EFUND !” “ DistralN IF You CAN : ” “WE DEFY PRosecution 1 ''
and many manifestoes of like tendency. There was also an emblem
carried about, consisting of a bucket, labelled “Whitewash," on the
end of a long pole.
At the various dinners, public and private, which took place in the
afternoon, speeches of a tone highly moral, with sentiments to match,
were delivered in great abundance. A State, it was contended, was an
irresponsible abstraction, and amenable to no law whether of honesty or
honour. Liberty of conscience, it was asserted, was an American's birth-
right; liberty of conscience involved liberty of action ; liberty of action
rendered payment or non-payment optional. One speaker remarked, in
a glow of philanthropy, that the interest of Pennsylvania was now iden-
tical with that of the human race, since she had appropriated everybody's
principal; and another, unaccustomed to public oratory, contented him-
self with declaring that, as to the merits of the question, people might
say what they liked, but for his part, before he would agree to pay one
cent, all he had to say was, he would be hanged—a declaration which was
received with unbounded applause. Among the toasts proposed, “Washi-
INGroN AND WIPE OUT Your Score,” “Jeffenson AND Jockey The UNI-
wease,” “DUFF GREEN AND Do Your CREditors Brown,” may be
enumerated.
The day and fire-works went off without any, beyond the average,
damage to eyes, apparel, and property, nor does it appear that the num-
bers lodged in the lock-up houses at night were greater than they have
usually been on previous occasions.
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE EIGHTH.—of Estates IN Possession, REMAINDER,
AND REVERSION.
Estates may either be in possession or expectancy—much in the same
way as a bird may be either in the hand or in the bush ; and the doctrine
that one of the former is better than two of the latter, may also apply to
some estates, particularly when the bush happens to be that verythorny
one—the Court of Chancery.
Estates in possession may be very soon disposed of—too soon, indeed,
by some who are forced to sell their property. We shall knock them all
down in one lot, by saying that estates in possession are estates that one
actually possesses; though estates in expectancy are the subject of some
of the very nicest law—the law being, by-the-by, very nice for the lawyers,
though anything but nice for the clients who pay for it.
An estate in remainder is where a man, having the fee-simple, grants a
lease of twenty years to A, and after that to B; as if a person should
treat A to the first drink of a pot of porter, which is afterwards to go to
B. Here A is seised of the whole pot during the term of his drink, but
afterwards B comes in as the remainder-man. In the first case there is
only one estate, though there are two interests ; and in the second case,
there is only one pot of porter, though two drinks, and, consequently, two
distinct interests are carved out of it. So there may be an estate to A,
remainder to B, remainder to C, which is like the well-known measure
vulgarly known as three outs to a quartern of gin, where A is in posses-
sion of the whole quartern, till B, who is a sort of tenant in expectancy,
has a term (that is to say a glassful) carved or rather poured out of it,
with the residue of the quartern to C, who takes whatever may be left, as
the remainder-man.
It is a maxim of law that an estate in remainder must be preceded by
an estate in possession, which is tantamount to saying that something
must be taken before anything can be left; but there is often nothing left
when the law begins to take, and thus the remainder-man finds nothing
remaining. It is another rule of law that a remainder commences at the
same time as the estate that precedes it; so that the remainder-man gets
his estate, in the eye of the law, before he gets it at all—but he does not
get it in his own eye, or, if he does, it is just about as much as he may
put in his eye and see none the worse for it.
Remainders are either vested or contingent. A vested remainder
being one that will certainly he had if the party entitled to it lives long
enough ; and a contingent remainder being one that a man who is
entitled to it will get, if nothing occurs to prevent his having it. To
revert to the allegory of the liquor: it is a vested remainder that falls to
B, if A may only drink half, because B must have some of it; but it is
a contingent remainder when B is to have a drop, supposing that A
happens to leave any. A contingent remainder may be dubious on many
grounds, 1st, as to person; as, when A has a pint of porter, with remainder
over to the first comer, then the moment somebody comes the remainder
rests in him, though till then it hath been contingent. This is the same
as an estate being left to A, with remainder to B's eldest son ; then, if
B has no son, the remainder is never vested.
A remainder may also be contingent, where the person is certain, but
the event on which it is to take effect is dubious ; as where land, or a
pint of beer, is given to A, and in case B survives, or drops in after the
first draught, then with remainder to B. Here the person is certain; but
there the event is dubious, for B may not survive—that is to say, not
come till the porter is all drunk up—and then there is of course no
remainder. There can be no remainder on any estate less than a free-
holl, or, to come back again for the sake of familiarity to the beer,
there can be no gift over, or contingency, on less than a pint; for the
estate or drop of porter would be too insignificant. Contingent remainders
may be defeated—as by surrender; and to pursue the simile of the
beer, the remainder may be destroyed either by being spilt, or
by the remainder-man executing a surrender, and saying he don't want
any.
We now come to an estate in reversion, which SiR Edward Coxe
describes as a return of the land to the original grantor; as when the lord
of the soil lets his back-attic for one week, he has the reversion at the end
of the week—if the tenant will go out quietly. It may be proper to
observe that, when a greater and a less entail meet in the same person,
the less is merged in the greater; as where the back-attic lodger takes
the entire floor, he is tenant of the whole floor, and not of the mere attic :
so if tenant of the first floor marries the lessee of the whole house, it is a
tenancy of the entire house, and the first-floor merges in the rest of the
building. It is now settled that one term of years may merge in another;
and it is also settled—which looks very like a settler—that 1000 years
may merge into one—if the one is the reversion ; which is something on
the same principle as six-and-twenty in an omnibus, or any other tre.
mendous crammer that might be cited.

LETTER XV.
FROM A MAIDEN AUNT TO A NIECE, ON THE IMPRUDENCE OF
MARRIAGE.
#;
- - º
** tº
MY DEAR CLARIBEL,
I should ill acquit myself of the duties
—l of an aunt—should show myself wickedly un-
grateful for the goodness that has hitherto
preserved me from the cares and frivolities of the marriage-state—
were I to see you, my sister's child, ready to throw yourself into a
bottomless pit, and never so much as scream to save you. It was
ºnly yesterday that Doctor PRUNEs acquainted me with your
Leadstrong passion for an unworthy creature of a man. Although
I had grouse for dinner—and you know how I love it !—I never ate
so little; and, in the evening, revoked twice in only three rubbers.
What with the news of Doctor PRUNEs and the tooth-ache, I have
scarcely slept all night, and at breakfast, instead of buttered toast,
absolutely gave chicken to the parrot. May you, even at the twelfth
hour, prove worthy of all I suffer for you !
You are only three-and twenty, and yet, with a forwardness that
makes me blush for the true dignity of womanhood, you already
think of marriage I had hoped that my lessons of morality would
have taught you better things. I had flattered myself that, strength-
ened by my principles, you would have risen above the too common
weakness that unites a woman to a creature in every way inferior
to herself, whatever the said creatures, in the fulness of their impu-
dence, may trumpet to the contrary. I do not dispute that men may
be necessary in the world; but, at the best, they are only necessary
evils. It is thus that every really sensible woman should consider
them. In the vulgar attribute of brutes—mere muscular strength—
they are certainly our superiors; but how immeasurably beneath us
are they in all that constitutes true greatness—in delicacy, liberality,
tenderness, friendship, fortitude, and taciturnity And, in their
hypocrisy, they confess as much ; for they call us angels—(though, I
am proud to say, no man ever so insulted my understanding)—yes,
angels, that they may make us slaves. How any woman can read
the marriage ceremony without having her eyes opened to the real
intentions of the creatures, is to me most wonderful. Love, honour,
and obey ! My blood burns to think of it ! To the ears of a sensible
woman every syllable rattles like a dog-chain.
I did think that my own CLARIBEL–taught by my precept and
example—would as soon have put her finger into a rat-trap as a
wedding-ring. I did believe that you would consider all the fine
things that men utter as nothing more than the false notes of a bird-
catcher; mere sounds to bring our free minds “from the heaven of
high thoughts,” as some poet says, and shut 'em up in cages. How
women can listen to a jargon of loves and doves, is melancholy to
think of. A woman of really strong mind hates Cupids as she hates
cockroaches.
Nevertheless, my dear, I can sympathise with human infirmity.
Everybody is not born to keep a heart of virgin ice that, pressed as
it may be, no pressing can melt. Still, there is nothing like a diver-
sion of thought to cure a hurt. It is wonderful how a wound heals,
if we never think of it. Therefore, return his letters to the man
who would ensnare you; and, forgetful of the cares and littlenesses
of marriage, give up all your thoughts to astronomy. It is a charm-
ing study, and presents a more ennobling field for the human mind
than the small limits of wedlock. How insignificant seems the wife,
studious of the goings-out and comings-in of a mere husband, compared
to the nobler woman who knows all about the Great and Little Bear !
How petty the noblest house in the noblest square, to the House of
Jupiter or Mars—how perplexing the cares of children to the lofty
contemplation of the Via Lactea (known, as Doctor PRUNEs says,
to the lower orders as the Milky Way);-how insulting to the true
greatness of the female mind the smallness of the wedding-ring,
when the ring of Saturn may be all her own, with no incumbrance
of Saturn himself
Or if, CLARIBEL, you want enthusiasm for the stars, why is there
not geology Properly considered, can there be a more delightful
employment for the female mind than to settle the ages of things
that vulgar souls care nothing about Who would not turn from
the cries of a nursery, to the elevating sounds of felspar and quartz?
What really great woman would study the mere heart of a mere
man, when she might discover fossil shrimps and caterpillars in
marble No. Woman will never assert her true dignity till she
can wisely choose between the two.
Then, after some ten or fifteen years—for it is a study too rashly
submitted to the young—botany may disclose its lovely mysteries.
How delightful, what true freedom for the human soul, to be exempt
from cares of husband and family, and to know everything about
the operations of pollen But I am incautiously anticipating a sub-
ject reserved for your maturer years.
Break, then, the chains with which mere tyrant man would bind
you, and—defying the slavery of conjugal life—live like DIANA,
And your still affectionate Aunt,
Lucret 1A DRAgon Mouth.
P.S. Is it true that the wife of Doctor BEETLEB now is really
dead? I wouldn't utter a word against the departed; I should hope
not, but—is she really dead
LETTER XVI.
THE NIECE'S ANSWER.
MY DEAR Aunt,
How can I ever express my gratitude to you, how repay
the care with which you seek to gather me to that sisterhood of which
Luchet IA DRAGoNMouTH is the crowning rose Alas, madam 1. I
feel my unworthiness I should but bring a scandal on the
community by the frivolity of my words and the earthliness of my
desires. I have the greatest respect for DIANA, but feel it impossible
to become lady's-maid to her. Therefore, dear Aunt, you must even
leave me to my headlong fate; and unbroken rest, heartier meals,
and successful rubbers, be your continual reward.
It would ill become my inexperience to dispute the sentence you
pass upon the other sex. Men are, doubtless, all you say of them :
therefore, forewarned by your opinion, I shall endeavour to support
the necessary evil that may fall to my lot with all the fortitude I may.
As for the marriage ceremony, I have read it again and again, and—
such is the hopeless perversity of my taste—think it the loveliest
composition 1 To my ears, it murmurs the very music of Paradise.
I feel the full force of what you say about astronomy. No doubt,
its study might relieve a wounded heart, but then as I feel no wound
that is not most delicious, why should I go to the stars to get rid of
it Yes, madam, I can forgive your talking about the stars. You
have never seen my ALFRED's eyes | No doubt the Great and Little
Bear have their attractions; but you never saw my ALFRED's
moustachel
Geology, too, may be fascinating. It may be musical to talk of
felspar and quartz; to seek for fossil bees that made honey for the
pre-Adamites; but you never heard my ALFR so sing Lore in thiae
Eyes—you never felt the pressure of his throbbing hand 1
As for botany, I really feel its influence in a manner I never felt
before ; for I am just now called to choose my bridal wreath of orange
flowers, and must therefore abruptly conclude—
Your affectionate Niega,
CLARIBEl MAYDEw.
P. S. It is not true that MRs. BEET LEBhow is dead; though once
she was given over by her physicians. Ha, my dear Aunt how

FIGHTING MISSIONARIES.
It is a pity that Exeter Hall should ever be confounded with
Woolwich Arsenal. A pity is it, that a fabric expressly built and
dedicated to thegatherings of Christian Charity—where she pleases to
call her working children, the bright ones of the earth, together—
should be made to “smell woundily of gunpowder.” But so, within these
few days, it has been. A meeting of the London Missionary Society
has been held at the Hall, for the purpose of considering the naughty
doings of the French blusterers at Tahiti; and the means proposed
to meet the wrong committed, was, to do further wrong. The best
remedy for the wound was a gunpowder plaster One reverend
gentleman proved that he had been misplaced by fate: certes, he
should have been a post-captain, and not a meek, black-coated
preacher of the Christian Mission, for, with a quickness, worthy of
SIR CHARLEs NAPIER, he enumerated the English naval force off
Tahiti, indignantly compared it with the force of France on the same
station, made a bold joke about Jack Ketch, and finally implied the
necessity of sending MR, PRitch.And back to his consulate, with all
the hubbub and glory of shot and gunpowder. For our own part,
we think the lips of Christian charity all-sufficient to settle the
difference; and should be very loth to call in the teeth of a man-of.
war. If, however, the London Mission think otherwise, we would
earnestly counsel them to address themselves to CAPTAIN WARNER,
whose secret is still in the market; and who, doubtless, if only to
spite Peel and the other unbelievers, would be very happy to treat
with the peace-loving men of Exeter Hall for a reasonable remune-
ration. . Thus, with the London Mission possessed of WARNER's
secret, they might disseminate practical benevolence by means of
the long range, and insinuate true Christianity among the heathen
by the invisible shell.
REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON
PARLIAMENTARY PETITIONS.
THE Committee appointed to inquire what becomes of the petitions pre-
sented to Parliament in each session, have found their task by no means
an easy one. The first step taken by the Committee was, to distinguish
between those petitions which lead to any result, and those which do not,
the Committee intending to report upon each of these two sorts. The ex-
treme insignificance of the number of those belonging to the former class,
soon induced the Committee to discard them from the present inquiry, and
to confine their researches to the class of petitions which lead to no result
whatever; and which, therefore, suggest an interesting field of research as
to what becomes of them. It seems, that the great majority of petitions
are ordered to “lie on the table;” and the Committee, therefore, deter-
mined on examining the table itself, without disturbing the position of any
of the petitions that had been ordered to lie upon it. The Committee were
greatly surprised to find that the table was entirely destitute of any papers,
though itself consisting of three blank leaves, which, on inspection, were
found to contain some writing; but, on further examination, the writing
proved to be the names of some of the clerks, who had amused themselves
by scribbling and drawing on the table while officially occupied in sitting
at it.
The Committee ascertained that, when a petition is ordered to lie on, it
is usually thrown under, the table; and here the Committee found so much
obscurity, that they were nearly abandoning the inquiry, when MR. DARKE,
the very intelligent dustman, volunteered to throw further light on the in-
teresting inquiry. The Committee had MR. DARKE under examination for
several hours, and ascertained from his luminous evidence, that, having
contracted with the parish of St. Margaret's, Westminster, to carry away
the dust and rubbish, he is compelled to include the House of Commons,
which makes more rubbish and kicks up more dust than all the rest of the
[. put together. The Committee ascertained from MR. DARKE, that
he was obliged to carry away thousands of petitions annually, and found a
great deal of difficulty in getting rid of them; because there are now very
few places in which dry rubbish may be shot, and the rubbish of the House
of Commons was much drier than almost any other rubbish he had met
with in the course of his long experience.
MR. DARKE was examined as to his having ever carted away any rub-
bish of a heavier description ; and he replied he thought he might have
done so, when he took the contract for St. George's, Hanover Square,
because he had carted away a good deal of rubbish from MR. Bentley,
the publisher of novels, in Burlington Street. Still, he preferred the
literary rubbish to the parliamentary rubbish, because the book stalls
furnished a market for the former, while the latter “had no chance except
with the cheesemongers.”
The Committee having gained a clue from this last expression, at once
turned their researches into a cheesy channel, and a clue being afforded
as to what became of the Parliamentary petitions, the Committee saw a
wide expanse opening before them in the butter-shops. Many intelligent
witnesses were examined, and some curious facts were ascertained, as to
the custom of adapting the petition to the cheese—an art which requires
considerable nicety and knowledge of character. MR. CARBERRY, of
Bond Street, was for several hours before the Committee, and it was
ascertained from him that he had at the outset of his career lost many
customers to whom he had been in the habit of sending cheeses. At first
he thought the cheese must be bad, but on inquiry he found it was the
envelope that had given offence, for he had sent home a ripe Stilton to the
Premier of the day in a petition to the House of Commons to address the
King, entreating his Majesty to remove his Ministers. After this MR.
CARBERRY carried his observations much further—and the result was
his adoption of a system for working his waste paper, to which he attri-
butes much of his success in business. He bought all the Parliamentary
petitions he could, and employed a clerk to class them into three heads—
Conservative, Whig, and Radical. The Conservative petitions he used
for sending home Parmesan, Gruyère, and Stilton ; the Whig petitions
were used for the Cheshire class of cheeses; while the Radical petitions
were devoted to the cheaper sorts, including black-puddings, and single
rashers of bacon. By this method, each class of customers consumed
their own petitions, and the prejudices of none were hurt through the
medium of his cheese, which had been, unhappily, the case in former
instances.
Mayoral Festivities:
It is reported that the Officers and members of the Honourable Artil-
lery º have it in contemplation to present their Treasurer, the
Right Hon. WILLIAM MAGNAY, Lord Mayor, with a piece of Plate, as an
acknowledgment of the hospitality and attention the corps have received
from his Lordship during the year of his Mayoralty.
The design is novel and severely simple, yet strictly emblematical of
the purpose which it is intended to commemorate : it is, a footless cup
without a bowl. The inscription is still an open question, but will, most
probably, have reference to his Lordship's well-known crest, viz., a
close fist.

we ourselves tremble at—so vast
is it — an explosive machine to
which WARNER's longest range is
a trifle — a power which will set
twenty millions of Anglo-Saxons,
roaring, raging and thundering—a
power which can let loose the
bloody, irresistible war-dogs, who
so many a time have hunted over
your country.
If we were not better patriots than you, we could

plunge the two countries into a war. There would be no end to the profit to us.
Our sale would go up to a million. We should be in no danger. Your bullets
would not reach us in the Strand, and our gains would be so enormous that
the smallest printer's devil might eat turtle soup all day, out of business hours,
and buy thousands into the funds.
But the funds would fall. They did in former quarrels. The funds fell and
the country suffered. The poor man was pinched and the horrible Income Tax
invented, in order that we might have the honour of beating the French.
We would beat them again no doubt, but the play is not worthy of the candle.
We might profit by a war, but our country would suffer. Punch therefore preaches
peace.
Ah, Sir I do you follow the example of Punch t Consider, there are some things
which may be bought too dear; a dotation for your family is one. None of the
papers have whispered the secret — but I and Palmerston knew it at once.
TANGIERs HAs heen Bom BARDED THAT THE PRINCEs MIGHT BE PENsionED.
This is a hard price the world has to pay for the maintenance of your amiable
young family, and puts one in mind of the Chinese economist, who burned a house
down in order to roast a pig. It was a neighbour's house too, as I’ve no doubt.
It is to get this money that the wise man par excellence of Europe, the lauded of
our Journals, the Napoleon of Peace, BEN D'Ismaeli's Ulysses, is burning towns
now, and perhaps going to incendiarise Europe to-morrow. Ah, Sir 1 after all your
doubling and shuffling, your weeping and protesting, and weary smiling—all the
labours of a life to make a character—is it not a pity to be losing it in your old age 1
What will Europe, what will MR. BENJAMIN D'Israeli, say? To endow your
sons, and out of other people's pockets too, is a comfortable thing; but what a
chance do you run for the sake of that enjoyment 1 You burn down a city—you
butcher, broil, and bombard whole myriads of Tangerines (poor devils 1 had they
but known how to make the offer, they ought to have proposed to pay down the
dotation-money at once—it would have been cheapest in the end for them).
Nor does the mischief end here with the benighted Turks. In a street, when
No. 4 is on fire, No. 3 begins to be rather anxious—and Gibraltar is No. 3, and a
pretty combustible place too.
Even though you are Ulysses, and the Napoleon of Peace, No. 3 won't
stand it. With every respect for your character, and the warmest wish that the
amiable little Joinvilles and NEMou as may be provided for, No. 2 is bound to
remonstrate against your peculiar mode of making your children comfortable. Only
let it be known what your plan is—and it is now beginning to appear pretty clearly
—not only No. 2, but the whole street, will be indict-
ing you for a nuisance, and we shall have the fire-
offices of all Europe on the look-out.
In other words, if you send crack-brained officers
to bully our consuls—if you patronise harum-scarum
young admirals who write schemes for the destruction
of our coast, and who are rewarded for their inge-
nuity by instant commands, and leave to practise their
favourite plans elsewhere—if you have a peaceful
minister, but take care that he be powerless and kiss
Her Majesty a score of times—our people will begin
to doubt that you are the NApoleon of Peace, and
others will take counsel with them.
There is the poor EMPERoR of Morocco, who
vows that he is a NApoleon of Peace, too, in his
way; and how do you serve him He can't practise
the peace he preaches, say you ; and you send Join-
ville to burn his cities, and Bug EAUD to lay waste
his territories, seize upon his flocks, and butcher his
people.
Suppose all Europe were to take up a similar
opinion with regard to a certain country that is said
to be at the head of civilisation. Suppose it were
to say, as it has before, “We don't trust you and
your professions of peace. You are false when you
make them ; and powerless to work them out. You
are peaceful; and yet your people are perpetually
brandishing their swords at the throats of all their
neighbours—cursing and shrieking, and endlessly
threatening war. You are peaceful; and yet you tell
one friend that you will take his Rhine boundary
from him—imprison the servant of another; tell
him he is a liar, and favour him with projects for
butchering, firing, and ruining him. You may pro-
test of your good intentions till you are black in
your royal face : but this is not our way of under-
standing peace.”
If this goes on much further, with all our love
of quiet we shall be forced to speak out. The Mis-
sionaries are already gone over to the war-party.
Have a care, great Sir, that Punch don't join then
too. Dire will be the day when that event occurs;
and we shall be compelled to perform the sad and
painful duty of poking up the Baitish Lion.

PRINCE ALBERT'S DEES.
We have been favoured by PRINce Albert–for
after what we have done, it may be very well sup-
posed that Punch is a first favourite at Windsor Castle,
even though his name as guest has not yet appeared in
the Court Circular—we have been favoured with a
private view of the royal Bee-hives. They are formed
after the most approved political principles, albeit the
said principles have not yet come into general fashion.
They are so constructed, that the working-bees within,
(they are a very curious species of bee, and bear an
outward resemblance to British mechanics and ar-
tificers,) are carefully deprived of all the honey they
elaborate, save the honey that is considered sufficient
to afford them ample sustenance in all seasons. Thus,
it will be seen, that the Bees pay a very large pro-
perty-tax; but, unlike too many of their fellow-sub-
jects, they are left enough to eat in return for their
labour. All is not taken from them. Their hives,
we understand, have been expressly fitted up for the
instruction of the PRINcE or WALEs, whose dawning
mind will, we trust, receive and appreciate the whole-
some political and social lesson they so unequivocally
convey.

A BISHOPS ARMS.
A schoon ER has been fitted out for the use of the Bishop of
NEwfoundLAND, to be used as a church in the smaller and more
remote settlements of his colony. She is called the Hawk (would not
the Lamb have been better?) and has been supplied with all neces-
sary ecclesiastical fittings. We are told that “at her mast-head was
displayed an ensign, one certainly new to the nautical authorities,
which caused many various speculations on the river—the arms of the
Bishop of Newfoundland appropriately emblazoned.” We should like
to know what the arms were that puzzled the simple rowers of the
Thames? Of course, they were composed neither of griffin, nor
tiger, nor pelican, nor cat-o'-the-mountain,_nor, indeed, of aught
ravenous or monstrous. Such bearings would have fluttered a
mockery of the purpose of the peace-bearing craft. What, then,
were they Doubtless, a Dove with Olive Branch. Any symbol
less innocent would ill assort with the “communion-plate” and
“the altar” to be found below. Nevertheless, a “Bishop's Arms”
always sounds oddly to us—as oddly as a cherub's suit of mail.
A VOICE FROM THE GROUSE.
THE news from the hills and moors continues to be quite as
interesting as the intelligence from Tangiers. Indeed, we question
whether there is not truer glory to be found in the adroit bringing
down of grouse and black-cock—as at the present moment effected by
English law-makers—than to be obtained by knocking men's houses
about their ears for the laurels of a Joinville and the dignity of
France. Certainly, if Punch might choose, he would all to nothing
rather walk the heather with dog and gun, than drop bomb-shells
through the roofs and garret windows of the unbelieving. Man-
shooting is, after all, a little more wicked than the killing of grouse,
and—in the instance of Tangiers—much less glorious. It appears,
however, that there are dangers to be encountered even in grouse-
shooting, of which men dream not : that sportsmen (especially par-
liamentary sportsmen) are liable to strange questionings by their
victims. We have this intelligence on the report of a very respect-
able M.P., who assures us that—according to the good old Pytha-
gorean theory—certain Members of Parliament who, whilst in the
flesh, have neglected their duties, are made upon their death to trans-
migrate into the bodies of grouse, for the express recreation of
the members who follow. It is well that this truth should be
generally known; and we therefore give a dialogue (duly authen-
ticated) that passed a few days since between a grouse and a sporting
M.P. The sportsman had his finger on the trigger, when he was
startled by the voice of the bird. We give the conversation that
ensued.
Grouse. Halloo ! what are you about 1
M.P. (Dropping his gun.) Bless my soul! A talking grouse
Grouse. Yes; there are a good many of us upon the hills.
M.P. A good many of you ! Why where do you come from 1
Grouse. Where you came from—from the House of Commons.
This is our punishment for nights misspent—for votes misgiven—for
all our sins committed as Members of Parliament. You don't know
how soon your time may come.
M.P. My time !
Grouse. Yes, for you look as great a sinner as any of us. It’s a
sort of retribution, that we who neglected what we were sent to do
in the House, should be made the future game of Parliament when
the session is closed. It’s quite true. There’s at least fifty of us
about the hills, who in our time have written M.P. to our names;
and done all sorts of tricks permitted by the two letters.
(The M.P. slowly raises his gun.)
You may as well save your powder and shot—my time isn’t come.
I’ve another year of it yet.
M.P. Another year !
Grouse. Yes; we are doomed to sit here upon the hills seven years
—and hard work the sitting is, I can tell you. This is my sixth
season : come next year, and you may bag me. In the meantime, if
you wouldn't after your death be made a grouse of yourself, don't
shirk your duties, or sell your constituents.
And with these words, according to our informant, the bird flew
away, leaving a great moral lesson for all Members of Parliament to
ponder on.
3gricultural College.
WE are happy to find that there is to be a College of Agriculture, and
that the worthy clodhopper will henceforth have his Alma Mater, like the
Cantab, and the honest highlow of industry will tread the sacred groves of
Academus as well as the aristocratic Oxonian.
We see no difficulty in organising a College of Agriculture, and we can
suggest a few of the probable professorships. Of course there will be a
chair of new-laid eggs, which the professor of poultry would be well
qualified to occupy. Degrees will be conferred in guano; and a series of
lectures on the philosophy of making hay when the sun shines would, no
doubt, be exceedingly popular. We should propose that, previous to
matriculation, every student should be required to undergo an examina-
tion on moral philosophy in connection with chaff, and the efficacy of
thrashing by hand when the ears are unusually lengthy. , Corresponding
with the university Masters of Arts, there could be Bachelors of Barley;
and the undergraduates might be brought direct to the Agricultural Col-
lege from Plough, as they are now brought to the universities immediately
from Harrow.
The examination papers would at first be difficult to frame, but the
following may be some guide for preparing them.
Find the square root of a stick of horse-radish.
Describe the milky way, distinguishing the whey from the milk, and
chalking out the way by which the milk gets there.
We merely throw out these as hints, but the Professors themselves will
be better able to frame the necessary questions for the use of students.
Clover will offer a very wide field; and hay, though rather dry, will be the
sort of food that the students may take advantage of.
BARON ALDERSON ON CRICKET.
THE learned Baron has delighted a Suffolk grand jury, and many
worthy folks besides, with certain intelligent and humanizing
remarks on a game of cricket which he saw played by a Noble Earl,
tradesmen, and labourers. He said he believed, if the aristocracy
“associated more with the lower classes of society, the kingdom of
England would be in a far safer, and society in a far sounder, condi-
tion. I wish I could put it to the minds of all to think so, because I
think it is true.” This may, or may not be true; but we put it to
the Duke of Rich Mon D, Lord BENT INck, CAPTAIN Rous, and
other gentlemen of the turf, whether after all their association with
the lowest of men—and only of course for the purpose of elevating
them—they, the plebeians, have not remained the knaves and sharpers
that they were before. Certain we are, the evidence in the Gaming
Committee showed the vast condescension on the part of the wealthy
and the high-born. To be sure, cricketing may have a healthier
moral influence upon the vulgar than betting; and, with BARox
ALDERson, we wish the aristocracy would try it.

THE PILGRIM BUCKINGHAM.
wands the end of last month,
MR. JAMEs Silk Buck-
INGHAM, with an en-
thusiasm akin to that
of Peter the Iſermit,
quitted the luxury of his
soft-bottomed fauteuil in
Hanover Square, and
with staff in hand and
oyster-shell in gossamer,
wandered into the pro-
vinces for the glorious
- purpose of enlightening
the rustic “clergy, professional men, naval and military officers,
gentlemen and their families,” by coaxing them to become sub-
scribers to the British and Foreign Destitute. Great is the philan;
thropy of Buckingham; for already hath he in divers places delivered
a public lecture on “the great advantage and convenience" of the
asylum in Hanover Square. Punch hath received a dozen hand;
bills, industriously circulated in various towns by the pilgrim ; and
subjoins an extract from one of the documents.
“The purpose of this Lecture is to develope and explain the origin, nature, and object
of a Public Institution recently established in London, of great advantage and convenience
to the Clergy, to Professional Men, to Napal and Military Officers, and to Country
Gentlemen and their Families visiting the Metropolis in the Season.
“The Institution was opened by His Royal Highness the Prince Albert in person...as
Patron, accompanied by º: Right Honourable the Earl of Devon, the President, and *
long list of Noblemen as Vice-Presidents, who were received by about 800 Ladies and
Gentlemen, members of the same; the number having since increased to about 1,200
rºon-.
*::::: Inaugural Lecture was delivered by Mr. Buckingham, at the Queen's Concert
Room, in London, before an assemblage of more than a thousand auditors, including
Ladies of the highest rank in society, as well as Gentlemen, by whom it was enthusiasti-
cally received; and it is believed that the nature of the Association requires only to be
*. generally known to insure its favourable reception by the higher classes, for whose
pleasure and accommodation it was chiefly established.”
Now, if any composer would adapt the above to music, let us
humbly suggest the air to which the landlady of old sang–
“Ducky, ducky, ducky, come and be killed,”
(with this slight variation of words)—
“The Buckinghams are waiting, their bellies must be filled.”
We, however, regret to state, that the pilgrim has not met with
that vast success which his hardihood evidently merits. This much
we gather from a letter written by the pilgrim himself—a letter
which, in the handsomest manner, has been handed to us for pub-
lication:—
To GEORGE Jones, Esq., BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE.
“MY DEAR Jones, Cowes, Aug. 19.
“What can have come to the people Is it the march of
intellect, or—worse than all—is it the malevolence of that scoundrel
Punch 7–for at my lecture this morning at the Town IIall, I bagged
but six ; and as I have to deduct from the half-dozen the housemaid
of my printer and the wife and eldest son of the bill-sticker, you will
at once perceive that the receipts are ruinous. IHowever, nothing
daunted, I dwelt with my usual eloquence on the advantages of the
Institute; spoke of the height of the footmen; the beauty of the lec-
tures; the breadth of the sandwiches; and the vivacity of our ginger-
beer. Thinking that a parson was among my hearers, I took a flight
upon our fine crusted port; but to my dismay discovered that the
wretch was nothing more than a bagman. Although I professed
myself ready to book names of members, and in the finest spirit of
liberality offered to commute the annual 5l. 5s. for fifty guineas
down, such, my dear Jones, is the perversity of human nature at
Cowes, no man heard me speak of money that he did not imme-
diately button his pocket. I have had no better luck at Dorchester,
at Sherborne, or at Poole. However, I attack the natives to-morrow
at Ryde, and the next day at Portsmouth.
I had almost forgotten to observe that, as I have had to follow in
the immediate wake of two brother lecturers, I may possibly suffer
from competition. But so it is. Mr. HollowAY has a person here
lecturing on his ointment—Dr. Monnison has another on his pills;
and therefore, though the Institute has quite as good a claim as
either the ointment or the pills upon the patronage of the world, and as
I take equally respectable means to make its merits known, neverthe-
less, I fear, I suffer from a crowded market. You may have observed
that, even at a fair, people will not patronise three fire-eaters at the
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
*TNS- -
same time; however, I will send you all particulars of my further
doings, and am, -
Yours, whilst the Bank of England lasts,
J. Silk Bucking HAM.
P.S.. I have caused myself to be placarded as “Ma. Buckingham,
THE ORIENTAL TRAvellen "it has struck me, that as MEHEMET
ALI is making a stir just now, if I were to dress myself in the very
dress in which he purposes to visit Mecca, it might draw. Your
opinion on such a point is worth something. What do you think
PAY YOUR GAMEKEEPERS.
What is sport to country gentlemen, is death it seems, or at least
destruction, to the farmers. The Brighton Herald, of August 3, contains
the following paragraph:—
“We are glad to see that the Game Laws have excited a very general and strong
feeling against them in all parts of the country. It is seen that the supply of hares is
kept up, not for the landlord's sport, but for his profit—the hares being fed at the
expense of the tenant-farmer. Five hares, it is well known, consume as much food as a
sheep, and we know of an instance in this county where the damage done to one piece of
wheat only is estimated at between 40l. and 50l.”
Hence, it would seem that Game conducts itself pretty much like Wer-
min. But, “Fiat justitia ruat caelum,” a phrase which we translate for
the benefit of country gentlemen, because it is to them we would address
ourselves—“Do justice, though at the sacrifice of rent.” Whatever your
game may eat up, do not let it eat up your tenants. Game must be pre-
served, we know.—True, Poaching must coexist with its preservation.
The peasantry must consequently be demoralised, gamekeepers every now
and then shot, a man or two hanged occasionally, and hundreds imprisoned
and transported. All this is very lamentable; but it cannot be helped ;
and the man who would sacrifice the pleasures of the field to the welfare
and happiness of his fellow-men, is unworthy the name of a British
'Squire. But, good gentlemen, behave as such—Pay for the keep of your
game—Allow for it at your audits—Why do you not actually sell the
animals which your farmers feed But perhaps you are right. Theu
why not, at once, turn your horses, cattle, swine, poultry, into your
tenants' fields? You are the law-makers; pass an act for the abolition of
pounds—all but your own. At least be consistent; at present you are
doing both things and persons by halves.
PRINCE ALBERT'S MILITARY PRIMER.
His Royal Highness Prince Albert is very actively engaged in rubbing
up his military education—which had hitherto been much neglected—by
reviewing his own regiment previous to the expected arrival of the King of
the French at Windsor. Her Majesty is very anxious that the Prince
should not appear at a loss in his capacity of colonel, when Louis Philippe
is present as a guest at the castle, and his Royal Highness daily reads from
a book the words of cºmmand, and watches the movements of the men,
so that he may ascertain what is the meaning of the various evolutions.
He has got as far as carry arms—which he is practising to pronounce as
“Carry hums tº under the tuition of an able drill serjeant.
IRELAND TO WIT.—IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT.
Sir Robert Peel, having determined to do his utmost to remedy the
evils of Ireland, has decided on rendering a Bill, having that object, a
matter of open competition. A PRIze of 1000l will be awarded to the
successful competitor. Candidates for the PRize Bill are to send in
their measures on or before the 1st of January next, to the office of Mr.
Punch, who has been authorised by Sir Robert PEEL to take and receive
the same. Each document to be accompanied by a motto, and a sealed
envelope containing the name of the author. The decision between their
respective merits will rest solely with Sir Robent Peel and Punch, and
if Punch and SIR Robent cannot agree, it has been arranged that they
should toss up.
Fashionable Removals.
The papers announce that that old sinner MEHEMET ALI is about
to retire from public life and devote himself to a religious retirement at
Mecca, where he will repent of his sins and adore the holy Stone. Here
is a subject for the accomplished author of “Palm Leaves” to exercise his
poetical powers. It is vacation, and we promise the honourable member
for Pomfret an insertion of his poem in the columns of Punch.
Another hint too may be advantageously addressed here to a well-known
individual. There is a certain law.lord who ought to be tired of the
vanity of public life by this time : let us hear of his departure to the
Holy City, and of the edifying repentance and austerities of HADJEE
BRough AM.

the low Ays—“THE LOST TRIBE"—AND
YOUNG ENGLANI).
R1DAY last an agreeable incident powerfully
tended to prove the truth of MR. Grong E
Jon Es’s theory—a theory so ingeniously, so
eloquently supported in his Ancient History of
America, that the Red Men are no other than
the descendants of the lost tribe of Israel.
Young England—it is proved by Young BEN
—is also a section of the wandered race. Well,
the Iowa Y INDIANs—the last marketable im-
ports from the Back-Woods—with an instinc-
tive feeling of their remote origin, did, on
Friday last, visit Grosvenor Gate, Park Lane,
and then and there did, in the most affectionate manner, fraternise
with the magnificent host, BENJAMIN D'IsrAE1.1, Esq., M.P. The
superficial newspapers stated, that “the immediate object of the visit
was to give these children of the forest an idea of an English gentle-
man's residence, and of the style of living of our aristocracy.” No
such thing; we grant, that such may have been the ostensible pur-
pose of the Indians' visit to BENJAMIN's wigwam, but the real object
was, as we have said, to fraternise, as the remnant of the tribe of
Israel, with YouNo ENGLAND, and in due ceremony, to admit MR.
I)"Isa AEL1, Lord MANNERs, M.R. GeoRG E SMYTHE, and other illus-
trious spirits of the regenerating party, as brothers of the tribe.
This ceremony was performed in the library. A suitable oration
was delivered by SE. Non-ty-YAH, the Medicine Man; and was re-
sponded to by the author of Historic Fancies, who chaunted an appro-
priate stave (to appear in the forthcoming new edition of his work.)
The Indians were then conducted over the mansion, and expressed
themselves prodigiously delighted with all they beheld. The kitchen
appointments wrought them into a state of high enthusiasm; and
when they were shown that very complex piece of machinery, the
ball-cock, which regulates the supply of water into the butt, they
were roused into a state of inconceivable excitement. Hereupon,
the host, with his fine knowledge of human nature, read “these
children of the forest” a couple of pages of Coningsby, and the
lowering effect was marvellous. They were immediately cooled
down to their ordinary temperament.
The party was next conducted into the bath-room. Whereupon,
the Medicine Man observed, that he cured most of his patients by
immersion in cold water, and by vapouring. Mr. D'IsrAEL1, with
one of his slaughtering smiles observed, “He had tried vapouring,
especially in Parliament; and all things considered, it had done
wonderfully.”
The house being thoroughly inspected, the party returned to the
dining-room, where—the Young England Members joining—the
dance of brotherly love was executed. A “déjeúner” was then
served up, and duly honoured. At four o'clock, the guests departed,
Mr. D'Is RAELI having with his own hand fixed the pen with which
he wrote the last chapter of Coningsby, in the head of the Medicine-
Man. (It may be viewed by the curious at Egyptian Hall.)
If, however, there be any truth in the report that the Ioways were
invited to Grosvenor Gate that they might see, and for a time share
in, “the way of living of our aristocracy,” we beg to inform Mr.
D'IsrAE1.1 that there are thousands of darkened souls in London,
equally ignorant of that Paradise, Grosvenor-Gate, as his guests the
Red Indians. Therefore, we have now no doubt, that Mr. D'Ish AELI
will upon this knowledge instantly issue cards of invitation to the
dwellers of Shoreditch, Whitechapel, Kent Street, Seven Dials, and
to other remote fastnesses of savage, pauper existence.
NOTA BENE.
The IOWY American Indians, now exhibiting at the Egyptian Hall,
belong to a tribe from the interior of the country, which is reported to be
a very honourable race, being always honest in their dealings with
strangers, and never breaking their faith when once it is pledged. They
must not be confounded with the tribe of the I OU’s, who are natives of
Pennsylvania, and bear a very opposite character,
Annoyance Jury.
We see the Inspectors of Weights and Measures were very busy last
week. We wish they had paid a visit to Sir Robert Peel, to test his
measures of last session ; for we are sure they would have found them
not only false and hollow, but many of them of no weight at all. The
Qui Tam and Commons’ inclosure measures, we are confident, ought to
EX PARTE LUD IN RE LORD.
An Opinion, by Punch.)
Punch is requested by an intelligent Correspondent, and cabman, to
explain a certain analogy which exists between gentlemen of the long robe
and gentlemen of the long whip. The latter, as we observed a week or
two ago, indulge in a peculiar variation from the standard of WALRER in
the pronunciation of the word CAB ; and a corresponding liberty is taken
by the former with the monosyllable Lord. As cabmen, vociferating in
their vocation, cry “KEB, sir!” so barristers, addressing the bench, say,
“My Lud.” Wherefore ?–Now for a morsel of logic.
Be it noted, that a barrister, in speaking of a nobleman by his title,
expresses himself like any wigless gentleman. It is plain, therefore, that
he does not call a judge his Lud from want of knowing better. Conse-
quently, he terms him so on purpose. If this is not.a first-rate sorites,
call Punch Sibthorp.
As there is no other valid reason assignable for counsel's thus curtailing
her Majesty's vernacular, Punch concludes that they do so for the sake,
as grammarians phrase it, of distinction. Not that they intend to confer
distinction : quite the reverse. They wish to distinguish between their
legal and their noble Lordships. Accordingly, they call the former LUDs,
to show, by not pronouncing the name in full, that they do not look upon
them as full Lords. Ludship is meant to denote a certain inferiority to
Lordship. So that Justices ALDERson, ColeRidge, and Williams are
Luds; whilst EARL SPENcER, Wiscount Melbourne, and the BARon
NATHAN are Lords. Lords BRough AM and CAMPBELL are both Lords
and LUDs—LoRDs in the House of Peers, LUDs in a Court of Justice.
Whether LoRD plus Lud is a higher title than simple Lord, is an inter-
esting question ; but we have not space to pursue it.

JENNY WREN'S REMONSTRANCE.
* --~~
AVING perused with wonder Lond Maidstone's poem, in the Morning Post, Jenny WREN
indites a humble remonstrance.
Jenny does not consider it necessary to teach the genteel reader that one of my lord's
respected names is Finch.
SHALL WE WHO CRUSHED THEIR FATHERS.*
SHALL we who crushed their fathers at Cressy and Poitiers,
And bade their guard at Waterloo “be off,” and “clear the way,”
Sit tamely by and tremble when swords have left their sheath,
And Gallic threats are bandied in the British lion's teeth
'Tis thus they prate of honour, and spit upon the hem
of Britannia's regal resture and shame her diadem. ,
No, by the soul of Edwann, by the triumphs long ago
Of the strong Norman lance and gallant English bow,
We will not cower before them while yet a bosom stirs
At the tale of CR1st IN's Morning or the Battle of the Spurs.
And yet they, &c.
Their ships are rolling in our ports, their banners deck our walls,
The tri-color is sighing in the breezes of St. Paul's.
For fear of us a hundred forts gird Paris with a chain,
And Jacobins and Anarchists look on, and daren't complain.
And yet they, &c.
They begged of us a favour, and we yielded them their plea,
The ashes of NApol. EoN from the island in the sea.
We gave them all they asked for, but we could not give them back
The glory which departed when we thundered in their track.
And yet they, &c.
The mark of England's heel is trampled on the neck
Of Paris and her citizens, of this they nothing reck;
But though her youth may bluster, and swear they felt it not,
There are other youths in England can make the brand as hot.
And yet they, &c.
Then DuPIN cease to prattle, and Joinville cease to write;
The ancients had a custom to hold their tongue—and fight.
Pray to the God of battles for a strong heart and hand,
And a better sword than IIoch E's to decimate our land.
And cease to prate of honour, and spit upon the hem
Of Britannia's regal resture, and shame her diadem.
SILLY LITTLE FINCHES.f
SILLY little Finches have silly little ears,
Make Poitiay to rhyme with way—little boy, it is Poitiers.
Why sit by and tremble when swords hare left their sheath,
Then will British lions begin to show their teeth.
Spitting is a nasty thing, which French people do,
Little lordling, don't begin expectorating too.
Roy Al Edward's in his grave—he and his long shanks—
Did he do our people good—butchering those Franks 1
HARRY FIFTH won Agincourt—won it at a pinch—
What became of HARRY Sixth-silly little Finch t
With your wiggle waggle, &c.
He's a silly fellow of rotten things who brags,
At church best look at your prayer-book—not those bloody flags.
What the Paris forts were built all for fear of you ?
Silly little Finch, so to cockadoodledoo !
With your wiggle waggle, &c.
Was it then so generous, granting them their plea
Bull-FINch ! are not islands always “in the sea 1"
Better read the story of the fight of Mount St. John,
IIe robs us half our glory who says the French had none.
With his wiggle-waggle, &c.
The march of English Wellington-heels has trampled Frenchmen low,
Swaggering young poet, pray Heaven it be not so.
Trampled men will turn and hate, that full well we know
We should never trample on a fallen foe.
0 you triggle-waggle, &c.
Then MAIDston E cease to rhyme, and Joinville cease to write,
Better ’tis to hold your tongue in order not to fight.
Better 'tis that little boys remember the old rules,
Nor cut their little fingers while playing with edge-tools.
And cease to poke at Frenchmen with your wicked little pen;
So, to little FINch, cries peaceful JENNY WREN.

for our establisl t. and who d the strictest injunctions to inculcate peace.
That event has much altered our opinions, and, indeed, our desire of maintaining terms
of politeness with the chief of the French Government. And (though we laugh to scorn the pretension of any man who would question our right to contradict ourselves
as many times in a column as we please), yet we condescend to own that our opinions are considerably altered by the brutal onset on Tangiers:
Lond Maidstone, then, has been untimely sacrificed. But his Lordship's mangled corpse will serve to show that we had a sincere desire to maintain the peace; and, at
the same time, it may be looked at as the first victim of what may be a long and fatal war.
Punch's Autograph.
GREAT is, sometimes, the misery of a high reputation! Punch is being
continually pestered for his autograph. §. therefore take this oppor-
tunity of informing those dealers in virtù, who are anxious to obtain his
hand-writing, that he has a few acceptances in circulation, and that the
way in which his admirers can best show their enthusiasm will be to
take them up. Particulars to be had of Punch's publisher. It is hoped
that no one but persons seriously inclined will apply.
The Burns' Pestival.
As we believe there are many enthusiasts in Scotland anxious to show
their sympathy towards the poet Thom, we beg to state that he dwells in
Inverury, and not, as the printer placed him in our last, in Inverary.

PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER,
LETTER XVII.
FROM A GENTLEMAN TO HIS FRIEND, ENTREATING HIM
TO RENOUNCE THE BOTTLE.
MY DEAR PETER,
MAy I, by a friendship of thirty years'
growth, be permitted to address you on your
faults—or, rather, your fault; for it is so capa-
cious that it swallows every other error; in the
same way that boa constrictors gulp toads and
other unsightly creatures of smaller dimensions.
May I venture to remonstrate with you on—well,
it must be said–your habitual drunkenness?
Alas! my friend, to what a condition has this
folly, this wickedness, reduced you ! This morning
only, I saw a full-grown cucumber in a bottle :
there is nothing in the object; it is a common-
place, to be seen in the windows of every pickle-
merchant: and yet did that imprisoned cucumber
touch my heart, and bring pathetic moisture into
my eyes; for by the tyranny of association, it made me think of
my forlorn friend. Yes; looking at that cucumber, trained to
grow in its glass prison, did I behold in it the hopeless condition
of PETER. Rubygill 1 There he is—thought I—there is PETER,
and who shall deliver him? And how, alas ! does that plethoric
gourd fully declare the story of my friend How, like him, was it
insinuated in its green youth—a very sucker—into the bottle's
throat; and how, when there, was it made to grow and swell, until
far too large to be withdrawn, it possessed the whole of the bottle,
and was then cut off for ever from the vine that had cherished it !
And is it not thus, PETER, with a doomed drunkard Does he not
enter the bottle in the greenness of his days, and though he may
again and again escape from the thing that threatens to inclose him,
at length is it not impossible for him to get away? Habit makes him
swell, and there is no hope for him ; cut off from the genial world,
he has no other dwelling-place than a bottle. Verily, PETER. RuBY-
GILL, Bacchus—like a pickle-merchant—has his bottled cucumbers,
and you are of them 1
And yet, PETER, I would fain hope for you. In the name of all
that is great and beautiful in the world, why seal your eyes to its
grandeur and loveliness, why walk with your drowsy brain in a fog,
when, touched by the light of beauty, it might answer the touch with
most delicious music 1 What, in truth, can you know of the bounty
and magnificence showered about you? No more than a silly fly, that,
finding itself in the palace of a king, sips and sips, and tumbles
headlong into the first syrup it may light upon. Have I not seen you
leaden-eyed —clay-pated—almost dumb with pain hammering at
your temples—degraded by nausea tugging at your stomach—your
hand shaking like a leaf-your mouth like the mouth of an oven—
and your tongue, I am sure of it, like burnt shoe-leather And for
what, PETER Rubygill 1 For some six hours' madness the night
before ?
You were left a comfortable competence. Where is it now Gone.
The bottle is the devil's crucible, and melts all !
You were tolerably good-looking. And now is your countenance
but as a tavern sign; where numberless little imps—liberated by
drawn corks—continue to give a daily touch and touch of red, proud
of their work, as portrait-painters to the devil himself.
There was a time when your word was true as gold. And now,
upon whom can you pass it? From the mouth of a drunkard, the
most solemn promise is no better than the best-made bad money: it
may pass for a time, but is certain to be nailed to the world's counter
at last.
You had friends. But there is a mortal fever in the reputation of
a drunkard, and sober men wisely avoid it.
You have a wife. Has she a husband 1 No. She vowed to love a
man, and you are a liquor-cask. Can you expect her affection ? You
might as reasonably expect her wedding-ring to hoop a wine-barrel.
| You have children. Poor things They see a satyr sprawl and
reel before them ; and, in their innocence, blush not as yet to call
the creature father
But, my dear PETER, there is yet hope. Learn to love home.
|Avoid the tavern. It is in the tavern-cellar that the devil draws up
|his army array against the brains and good resolves of men. It is
there that he reviews his legions of bottles, and prepares them for
the attack upon weak humanity. But, arm yourself, PETER ; meet
the assailants with cold water; and, in the fight, you shall have the
earnest prayers of your old friend,
CoRY Don Rivers.
LETTER XVIII.
The ANSWER.
MY DEAR Cory Don,
You talk of the beauty of the earth—you talk of the mag-
nificence of the world ! Why, then, let moles sing psalms to the
moon, and that hermit in feathers, the screech-owl, tune a ditty to
the noonday sun. The bottle is the true philosopher's microscope,
and shows him worlds within worlds that you, poor naked-eyed
wretches, never had the heart to dream of.
You say that you have seen me with my brain in a fog. Poor
ignorance After a night's—say three nights"—continual happiness,
you little know the bliss I walk in. You little think of the genius
within me, that turns your scoundrel streets of London into the
abodes of the blessed. What see I there but love and truest brother-
hood The very knockers wink and laugh at me ; and roses and
honeysuckles grow about every lamp-post. There are, I know, weak,
puling creatures, who talk of headaches; but these are milk-sop
neophytes, not yet of the true priesthood of our order. What if
now and then I have a twinge Think you I accuse the bottle ; I
should be a villain to do so. No : it’s the d–d east wind.
As for the fortune that was left me, it is true I have invested it in
the bottle ; and, oh what compound interest have I had for my
money ! Whilst you would count every rascal guinea, and, after you
had counted all, broke into a cold sweat to think there was no more,
I—seated on my tavern-throne—have had wealth that would con-
found all arithmetic. All about me has been glorious riches I have
drunk out of hollowed diamonds, and spat in gold-dust.
It is my darling faith that every bottle contains in it a pair of
beautiful wings, to lift poor man above the gutter-mud which this
sober world is made of. A pair of wings And I, like MEacu RY,
can't do without three pair.
I have somewhere read it at school—ha! Rivers, sometimes at
the heel of the night I see you again in your green jacket, and I sit
and enjoy myself, and let the sweetest of tears run down my nose—
well, never mind that—I read it at old CANETwig's—that Jupiteh
fastened the earth to heaven with a gold chain. All a flam, my
dear boy It was no chain, but a splendid, a most magnificent line
of linked bottles. The higher you climb, the further you are from
this vagabond world. Pity, my dear fellow—pity it is, that the road
is so devilish slippery !
You say I had friends. Had t I have millions. , Ha! my good
creature—for you are good, I believe, sober and stupid as you are–
you don’t know the philanthropy that a corkscrew lets out upon me.
I may have been ruffled; may I be pardoned for it, I may now and
then have thought harshly of my poor erring fellow-creatures, but—
pop 1–out comes the cork, and the wine, as it bubbles forth, speaks
pacifyingly, soothingly. Again—again The bottle coos like any
dove; and I have not listened to it above two or three hours, when I
feel myself turned into one large lump of human honey ! And then
these two hands of mine are multiplied ten million times, and Ishake
hands with every man, woman, and child upon this beautiful earth,
my creditors included.
But all this, though much, is nothing to the wisdom—the know-
ledge—that drink so subtly lets in upon poor, darkened man. What
is it ! You have studied these things; but then you have studied
them with a dry, dusty throat; and so, can know no more of the
true operations of the intellect—glorious intellect—of majestic man,

than a monkey knows of a steam-engine. Well, what is it? I say,
what is it? Ha! my dear soul, if you had only two bottles of the
stuff that is now shining before me—shining like a lion's eye—you'd
know all about it. Then you'd know metaphysics—that is, meta-
physics assisted by glorious wine—here's a bumper to you, old cock 1
God bless your little green jacket !—metaphysics is this, as you'd
know. Every man has an angel within him. Lord love us ! and
yet, sometimes, we use one another as though we lodged nothing but
devils. Well, as I said, every man has an angel within him ; and
this angel—poor thing !—you dull, sober, miserly fellows, board in
the most rascally way; giving him nothing generous to drink, or
just wetting his lips, and there an end. And what’s the consequence?
Why, he tells you nothing worth knowing—just casts up your
accounts for you—gives you a nudge when stocks are going, or some
small chandler matter of the kind; but, with a noble resentment of
your shabbiness, he does nothing more. What does he to me, who
know how to treat him I give him bumper after bumper, and
my brain feels him expanding his wings—you, poor wretch I don't
knows that he has wings—bumper after bumper, until, at last, my
angel takes up his golden fiddle, and plays me such a tune (I can feel
him rosining his bow at this minute)—such a tune, that as it sounds
I catch all sorts of wisdom ; thoughts like diamonds, bright and
everlasting.
Ha! haſ he's playing now, and I drop the pen to listen, and feel
myself an emperor.

MY DEAR Cohydon,
Don't mind the stuff I’ve scrawled above—for
I’ve been mad this month past. I am just arrested. You'll find
me at —, Chancery-lane. Come, come—for God's sake, bring fifty
pounds, and you will everlastingly oblige
Your wretched friend, "
PETER. RuBygill.
PADDINGTON TO THE BANK IN ONE DAY :
1T may be interesting to travellers to know, that the journey from
Paddington to the Bank is now accomplished regularly in one day. An
ºmnibus leaves the Yorkshire Stingo at 8 A.M., and, proceeding leisurely
down the New Road, stops at the Regent's Park to take up fresh passen-
gers. It then proceeds at a rapid rate to the corner of Tottenham Court
Road, where another halt is necessarily made to enable the coachman and
guard to have a little refreshment. No other stoppage is made after this
till the omnibus reaches the King's Cross, where a little delay sometimes
occurs to allow the passengers the opportunity of observing the picturesque
confluence of no less than six distinct thoroughfares. The halfway-house
is the Angel at Islington, a noted house for beer and accommodation, at
which the coachman and guard always stop to dine. This does not take,
upon an average, more than an hour. The omnibus then proceeds at 2 P.M.
Quitº way down the City Road, and, after stopping at the Grecian Saloon
to take in cheroots, reaches the Bank (the wood pavement permitting) a
little, before dusk: What would our grandfathers say to this wonderful
rapidity of travelling :
Clemical.--WE understand that MR. Robert Montgomery is appointed

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
RULES FOR NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENTS.
Erºſ) upposing you wish to contribute to a public charity,
-- " - send your money to the Editor of a newspaper.
He must acknowledge the receipt of it, and so
you get your name and benevolence advertised
in the best part of the paper for nothing.
2. Another good method, if you are fond
of appearing before the public, is to request
the Editor to state that “the Richard Jones
who, in our police report of yesterday, was
sentenced to Bridewell for shoplifting, is not
the Mr. Richard Jones, the respected chiro-
paedist, of Sackville Street.”
3. If you are writing to a political news-
paper, never mind about writing on the two
sides of the paper, as, depend upon it, it will
be a recommendation in your favour if the
Editor sees you can write well on both sides.
4. You need not be particular about writing
legibly, as it stands to reason, if the Editor cannot read your letter, that
you will be spared the mortification of reading in the next day's Notices
to Correspondents, that “Philo-Justitia, is an ass.”
5. It is usual in sending a statement, which impugns the character of
another person, to send your name and address with it ; but, as in
matters of libel, this is a very troublesome, as well as a very expensive
plan, it is better to send any body else's card rather than your own. By
this means you avoid publicity, and have the double gratification of
annoying two persons at once. - - - - -
6. Inserting your death one day, and contradicting it the next, is an-
other very cheap plan of advertising in a newspaper. . Besides you have
the advantage of learning in your lifetime what your friends think of you
after your death. This plan, however, will only answer once.
7. It is better, perhaps, not to send any poetry to a newspaper... We
never recollect an instance of the Times inserting “A Sonnet to a Sow,”
or “Lines to my Mary.”
8. Be careful of quotations, especially in a foreign language. If an
editor knows his own language well, it is as much as you have a right to
expect of him.
9. Never send anything to a newspaper “to be continued,” unless it
is a legacy or a dozen of port.
10. Never trouble yourself in calling to see the Editor of a newspaper.
It is a strange circumstance, but you might call a hundred times and
always find him “out.”
SANCTITY AND CANNON BALLS.-JOINVILLE
|N IRELAND.
The Belfast Vindicator—one of those “talking potatos” that would be
mischievous but for their delicious absurdity—thus gabbles of Tangier
laurels:—
“The PRINCE prjoinville has won his laurels ſquery, stonecrop) before the ramparts
of Tangier. We are sure they will not be his last. We are full of confidence in his
future triumphs. He has a mother, whose prayers are, no doubt, offered up for his
honour and his welfare; that mother is a living saint, and her prayers are not offered
in vain.”
The French Queen is a most admirable woman ; nevertheless, we hope
better from the prayers of saints than bombarded towns, and a butchered
people. Surely, prayers were not made for the better direction of cannon-
balls, or the more perfect throwing of Congreve rockets. Or, for a
moment granting that they were, surely her Majesty's prayers might, in
this last instance, have produced better gunnery. The Vindicator, or The
Tator, continues:—
“What if he [Joinville] should invade Ireland? Why, in that case, all that we can
take upon ourselves to say is, that the Irish people could offer him no resistance, seeing
that their Government has left them no arms. We could not be expected to fight him
with sticks. But if he should happen to bring with him 100,000 stand of arms, and offer
them gratis to those who may be willing to possess them, why, in that case, we should
leave people to judge for themselves of the propriety of accepting them. This country was
thrice invaded by France in the last century, and it would not surprise us that the present
century saw one or two more invasions before its close.”
The writer knows the small value of his head, or he would hardly cackle
such treason. For ourselves, we would not deprive him of arms;
certainly not. In reward of the above, we would have him made to walk
sentry six hours a day before his own office—with a musket on each
shoulder—a couple of cannon balls slung at his waist—his feet in shoes
of Gallic wood—and on his simple head a foolscap of tricolor soft paper.
BRIGHTON FORtified.
In the event of a rupture with France, we are happy to state, that
Ministers have taken the best means to keep the enemy from this town,
having engaged CHARLEs KEAN to play here during the whole of the war.

REPORT OF THE LONDON SEASON.
an there be conceived a more interesting study than that of human
nature especially in its feminine modification. Punch, anxious as
his BRough AM for the promotion of all the sciences, has lately been
philosophising among the Fair. In other words, he has been
questioning every young lady whom he had the happiness of
dancing with or sitting by, with a view to eliciting her recollections
of the London Season just past; and he here presents the results of
that process to his readers:—
Miss MARY Anne Stowers informed Punch that she had been in
town for several months. Would confess that she had been stopping
in Bedford Square, at a solicitor's. Went every day to the West
End. Should so like to live there. The carriages were so splen-
did. Envied those who rode in them so much The shops—
she meant the linendrapers, of course—were magnificent. Saw dresses in the windows
that were perfect loves, and bonnets as lovely. Had seen all the sights. Wouldn't deny
that she had kissed Tom Thumb. The Ojibbeways were horrid; but interesting. Went
to the Opera once, with an order. Couldn't exactly recollect what she saw. It was Don
something: Pasquale, perhaps; perhaps Giovanni—had forgotten which ; but it was very
splendid. The Royal Academy was a great treat; MacLise was very talented; so was Mull-
Ready, so was EastLake: which of them had painted the “Whistonian Controversy” did not
recollect. Begged that Punch wouldn't talk about the Polka; it was perfection. Had made
many observations on things in general; had principally to remark—that cardinals were popular,
tunics a great deal worn, and skirts, trimmed with a succession of flounces, highly fashionable.
Miss EMMELINE Aubrey said that she had been staying with her aunt, Lady Mincingham,
in Grosvenor-square; where she had passed an existence truly delightful. Was always going
out in the carriage; seldom walked, except now and then through a quadrille. Occasionally
promenaded, very gently, in Kensington Gardens, to hear the band play. Delighted with the
* Blues;” did not mean literary society by that—what a question I Had been to the Opera and
LADIES”
Ballet over and over again, to the Chinese Collection, Burford's Panorama, balls, concerts,
exhibitions, and sights without number; had been, in short, everywhere. Had never been to
the British Museum: where was it? Had seen Westminster Abbey—the outside of it. Actually
once went to the Royal Institution. Heard FARADAY-had no idea what on. The Opera was
Paradise; the Ballet, beyond everything. Cekiro was an angel ; GR1s and PERsian nightin-
#. MARto a love; Fornasarrah idol; LABLAcur immense, really, without a joke 1 The great
eatures of the season were the Polka and Tow Thumb; couldn't say which was the greater. The
Philharmonic was heavy; the Ancient Concerts triste—no causerie going on at either: missed
Labitzky at both. CHARLEs KEMBLE's readings of SuakspeaRE were clever; so was ShakspeaRE
himself, certainly, but passé and Gothic. Preferred the French plays immeasurably. English
performers were not artistes. Had learnt a great deal while in town—couldn't say what, it was
more than she could tell.
Miss AMELIA BATEs said that she had been residing with her brother-in-law at Camberwell,
MR. Figley, a merchant in the City. Had been under the Thames Tunnel; it was ever so long.
The Docks were very extensive; took less interest in them than in the Industrious Fleas. The
Monument was very high. St. Paul's was a vast building. HERR DöBLER and the Wizard
of the North struck her as much as anything; thought them equally wonderful. Had
she learnt the Polka! Oh yes; a real Bohemian gentleman came to teach it her every Wednes-
day. Had been to the West End two or three times; should never forget a silk that she saw
under the Quadrant, nor an ice and a basin of mock-turtle, which she had had there. Had
been to a good many parties; met several nice young men, and enjoyed equally nice suppers.
Had remarked that pearl necklaces, earrings, and Adelaide boots, were very much the rage; no
other observations had occurred to her in particular.
The above examinations comprise the cream of upwards of one hundred, instituted in as
many different cases by Mr. Punch. His note-book contains numerous answers relative to
Rotten Row, Almacks, the Waverley Ball, and other gay and festive scenes of a similar descrip-
*ion. All these responses are most enthusiastic; but being chiefly of an interjectional character,
me has thought it unnecessary to record them.
Lincoln DisrRanchised.
Ma. BARRY has strenuously objected to Colonel. Sibthone entering the new House of Commons,

MEDICAL REFORM.
The following plan of a Council of Health and
Medical Education, is respectfully submitted to
Sir JAMEs GRAHAM by Mr. Punch, who conceives
that it will accord with the Right Hon. Baronet's
ideas of Medicine exactly.
The Council of Health shall beformed from the
Members of the present College of that name; re-
inforced by a selection from the different patent
medicine venders, the advertising surgeons, and
the itinerant lecturers upon Animal Magnetism :-
The President of the Council shall be the Arch-
Hygeist; and the Fellows shall consist of those
º above alluded to, who advertise.
The President and the Council shall nominate
the Examiners.
The examinations shall chiefly have reference to
the ability of the candidates to concoct puffs and
posters. Testimonials as to ability will be received
from the Editors of the “Morning Paper,”
“Evening Journal,” &c., &c.; also from noble-
men, green-grocers, ladies of title, mechanics,
operatives, farmers, and others, who shall certify
as to the benefit they have derived from the pills,
elixirs, tinctures, drops, or other remedies of the
said candidates.
The following Professorships shall be founded.
A Professorship of Pills and Ointment.
A ditto of Universal Medicine.
A ditto of Life Pills.
A ditto of Homoeopathy and Humbug.
Lectures will also be delivered on the file
subjects; all candidates being required to ...;
them.
On the Blood, considered as the Seat of all
Diseases.
On Nervous and Mental Complaints; with
the Cure for Benevolence rather than Gain.
On Brandy and Salt.
On the Popular System of Therapeutics for
the time being.
The syllabus of this course to be as follows:-
1. On the Pleasure of Cheating.
2. On the Pleasure of Being Cheated.
With regard to the fittest person to deliver the
course of Lectures last mentioned, Punch has his
own opinions; but he will leave this point to the
discretion of Sir James GRaham.

London against all England.
The cities of York and Kent are contending for
the honour of the title for the last-born Prince.
We recommend Her Majesty to crush the dis-
pute at once, before it grows into a civil war. The
best way to silence both pretenders would be, we
think, to create a bran new title for the occasion.
We suggest for a title, the Duke of London.
We are sure the little PRInce would not say may

Paris, and we will wager the amount at our
bankers he will immediately see the necessity why
the Modern Babylon should be represented in
DEBRErr’s “Peerage” by something better than a
trumpery Lord Mayor. We are in earnest; and
we can only say that, should the little PRINCE be
made the Duke, as he ought to be, of the first city
in the world, that we shall be happy—besides
standing sponsor, if the Queen wishes it—to pre-

THE BOMBARDMENT OF TANGIER.

a-flying, and there was such a roar of laughter aboard of us, you'd have thought it was pay-day. Bless

the Frenchmen, for all the world, as you may have seen boys look through a pastry-cook's window

There has been a good deal of talk about the bad gunnery of Joinville. Poor young man l I dare

IMPROVEMENTS AT WINDSOR
CASTLE.
The Commissioners of Woods and
Forests have resolved on pulling down the
old houses in the Lower Ward, called the
Lower Foundation, at Windsor Castle, and
set apart for the residence of the Military
Knights, who will be turned out of house
and home by the arrangement. The Mili-
tary Knights are to be stowed away any-
where, and a cock-loft has been found for
three of then at the top of the Salisbury
Tower, which is to be made weather-proof,
for the accommodation of the ousted
veterans. A couple more are to be put over
an old gateway, in a sort of round sentry-
box built by HENRY VIII. and nearly
blown down in the reign of GeoRGE I.,
but now about to be plastered up, to prevent
the Knights from being blown away by the
wind, or washed completely out by the
rain beating in upon them.
More Mysteries of Paris.
Because cases of poisoning are not fre-

. Orfil A, the celebrated chemist, is
publishing, in the feuilleton of the Siècle,
a series of articles on the most subtle
poisons, describing their uses, history,
secret application, &c. The next publica-
tion of the sort, we suppose, will be, “Fire
Minutes' Advice to a Young Wiſe on the
Care of an Old Husband; or, the Young

Pecksniff Monomania.
A few nights ago, SiR Robert PEEL
visited the Strand Theatre. He was so
struck with the Pecksniff of H. HALL (a
perfect piece of acting that all the world
should see), that nothing could convince
the Prime Minister that it was not he him-
self upon the boards. SIR IRobert con-
tinued to be so possessed with this idea,
that on the succeeding Saturday he abso-
lutely presented himself at the treasury of
the theatre to take his week's salary.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A DISH OF GLORY.
The Oran correspondent of the Times relates a fact touchingly
illustrative of the moral condition of the French army of Africa.
In November last, one EMBARAck, the Khalif of ABD-El-KADER,
with between seven and eight hundred infantry, was set upon by
GENERAL TEMPoun, with four squadrons of cavalry. Nearly four
hundred of the Moors were slaughtered, and among them EMBARAck,
after he had wounded six Frenchmen. The Khalif dead—then came
in the sweets of revenge : The Times says:—
“The Spahis, or native cavalry, immediately after EMBARAck fell, cut off his head.
The head of EMBARAck was then covered with honey by the Spahis, and sent to Oran;
arrived at Oran, the head of EMBARAck was then salted, and thence despatched to
Algiers. At Algiers, the head of EMBARAcx was “served up' at a soirée of MARs HAL
Bugraun, something in the style of the serping up on a charger of the head of John
the Baptist mentioned in the New Testament. When all eyes had been sufficiently
regaled with the sight of the head of the brave chief of the desert—the unconquerable
enemy of the French (conquered only by accident)—the Marshal, yielding to his instincts
as a soldier, gave the head a funeral with the ceremony awarded to the rank of a
lieutenant; and the head of EMBARAck was at last buried, either at Médéah or Miliana,
with all due military honours.”
We think the Marshal acted without due consideration. He ought
to have carried out the principle manifested in the “serving up" of
a human head at the table of a Christian hero, and not have buried
it. What an idle ceremony was this serving up, if a funeral with
military honours was to follow What a waste of honey and salt.—
what a piece of useless show, the charger . . In the straitened condi-
tion in which the French army too often finds itself in Africa, we
think—we hazard the opinion with all modesty—that a much better
use might be made of slaughtered enemies.
Man is the victim of many foolish prejudices, until philosophy with
her sweet voice—“musical as is Apollo's lute”—converts him from
his darkness, and makes him all her own. Now, philosophy has
evidently done much with MARs HAL BUGEAUD and men of his plastic,
yet heroic substance: nevertheless, the MARs HAL has his best lesson
to learn, otherwise he would never have buried the barbarian's
head; no, he would have consummated the tasteful, the humane
yearnings that set the head before him, by supping off it. He would
have paid EMBARAck the most delicate compliment by incorporating
him with himself: he would thus—in the sweet slang of the French
army—have fraternized with the fallen Bedouin.
That soldiers do not eat soldiers, has always appeared to us a gross
prejudice, altogether unworthy of tradesmen in war: a squeamish-
ness inconsistent with the atmosphere of fire, and blood, and blas-
phemy, in which the laurel is usually cultivated. It is, however,
something to find that MARs HAL BUGEAUD and his African heroes
are getting a little in advance of the rest of Europe, and vindicating
French claims to superior civilisation in the art of war, as in the art
of cookery and mantua-making. It is a step gained, that a hero will
have a hero's head served before him in a charger; the next move-
ment will, of course be, for the hero to say grace and fall to. We
can discern the hankering, the liquorishness of appetite, that has the
human joint put upon the table,_and then the latent weakness, the
deference to popular prejudice, that, with a sigh, bids the untasted
dish be taken off. And after all, what folly, what waste, to give to
worms that which might have done so much good to MARshAL
Bug EAUD !
The human lawfulness and wisdom of war once granted, we confess
we look upon any indisposition to make the most of our enemies,
by eating them, as a mere sickliness of sentiment—an affectation
unworthy of the natural majesty of man, made more majestic by
musket and seventy rounds of ball-cartridge. Let us consider a
razzia by the French—one of those interludes which, to the employ-
ment, if not the delight of the recording angel, they are every day
enacting in Africa. These Christian men come swoop upon an un-
armed village. They cut the throats of the men—bayonet their wives
and children, if at all troublesome—set fire to the growing crops—
and drive off every head of cattle. Consider the scene—the heroes,
with another sprig of laurel, marched away—and say, if it be not a
place for devils to revel in Consider the blackened earth, the
smouldering ruin, the human form divine gashed and stabbed, and,
worse than all, outraged beyond the decency of words to tell; and
what is there in the spectacle that Beelzebub himself might not
feel a diabolic pleasure to claim as his own especial handiwork—
his own doing?—albeit committed by men, whose creed it is to
“love one another tº
As then, apparently to us, it really requires a greater amount of
moral courage to kill a man, than to eat him when killed, we must
again express our satisfaction that MARshal Bug EAUD has so cun-
ningly, so adroitly touched the pulse of human prejudice to feel its
present cannibal condition. Be it our duty to assist MARs HAL
Bug EAUD, by every argument at our command, in his praise-
worthy purpose.
The Commissariat difficulties with which the French have to con-
tend in Africa are well known : they are constantly, though in the
face of the enemy, on short commons. Now, let the Marshal's hint
be ripened into practice, and so long as an enemy is to be found, so
long will the soldier be supplied with a sufficiency of rations. IHe
may satisfy his glory and his appetite at the same time. It becomes
as much a war of the knife and fork as of the sword; glory, as we
have said, going hand in hand with full eating. Thus, the French-
man kills his enemy, and he devours him—as we eat a custard–
flavoured with bay-leaves.
The refinement of the French army may, possibly, revolt at the
dish; but we beg to assure our lively and chivalrous neighbours that,
to use one of their own adages, the appetite will come with eating.
The acute Doctor MUFFETT, an Elizabethan philosopher, writes
of a certain king of Lydia, who “ having eaten of his own wife, said
he was sorry to have been ignorant so long of so good a dish.” To
be sure, the Lydian king may have spoken more as a husband than
as a gourmet—but we have the assurances of New Zealanders, and
others, that the human animal is very excellent feeding. Hence, as
MARshal Bug EAUD has gone so far as to familiarise his army to the
sight of human heads—honeyed and salted—in chargers, we trust
that his next lesson will be to make them draw to and eat. The
saving to France will be enormous. No Arab so tough that he may
not be edible; for the aforesaid Doctor Muff ETT observes, “a
lion being showed to a strong bull three or four hours before he be
killed, causeth his flesh to be as tender as that of a steer : fear dis-
solving his hardest parts, and making his very heart to become
pulpy,” Upon this theory, we can judge of the effect of the French
lions upon even the oldest and hardest Bedouins.
Instead of burying the killed, as is sometimes done with the usual
military honours, they might be eaten, after a grace composed quite
in the spirit of the same Christianity that compasses their destruction.
If such a dish becomes common in the French camp (and after the
exhibition of the head in the charger we have great hopes,) we would
advise Parisian cooks to study some new condiment to add, if pos-
sible, to the delicacy of its flavour. Let us, for instance, suggest a
sauce piquante à la baïonnette.
PUNCH IN THE PROVINCES.–CLIFTON.
ot liking the cockneyism of a “Sum-
mer's day at Windsor,” or a
“Spring Wºn to Hampton Court,”
we determined on an “August
afternoon at Clifton.” Having
executed a sort of steeple-chase in
a cab from the Punch office, we
arrived at the Great Western Rail-
way Terminus in time to snatch a
handful of tickets from the startled
clerk, and to have them snatched
back again by the policeman, to
whom we stated our intention to go
to Bristol, and our wish to be re-
gularly put in the train for getting
there.
The Great Western Railway is a
wonderful triumph of cash and
F pick-axes over obstacles of a fiscal
as well as of an earthy nature. The
tunnel at Box-Hill, proves that man may get through, almost any thing.
A railroad suggests, however, any train rather than a train of sentiment,
and there is no such thing as the poetry of loco-motion. Reality, is to
the fancy, what the stoker is to the fire on the engine,—with, however,
this exception—that while the stoker pokes the fire to keep it in, reality
pokes the fancy completely out. - -
We have arrived at Bristol, that city famous for its Bristol board and
lodging. The Mayor and Corporation afford fine specimens of the Bristol
Board, for they are what may be called very great cards in their own
Odinion.
P. great feature of Bristol at the present moment is the Great Britain
steamer, and it is likely to be a permanent feature too, for she •ccupies
much the same position in the dock as George the Thind's apple did in
the dumpling : any one might wonder how it got in, for getting it out is
quite out of the question, unless everything that surrounds it is utterly
demolished. It has the power of 1,000 horses, but the stupidity of a few

—r-S-
asses has prevented the thousand horse-power from being made available.
She has no paddle-boxes, and, if she had, they would be of no use to her;
for the only way to get her out to sea, is to pull down all the docks or
half the city. There are three boilers, so that she might take in all the
washing of Bristol, and six masts, upon which the clothes might be dried
with the utmost facility.
Continuing our course we come to the celebrated rock of St. Vincent,
where the naturalist picks up Bristol stones and the mere natural drinks
the hot water. The Clifton Waters contain a quantity of gas, and this
accounts for the invalid occasionally flaring up under their influence.
The terms are 2d. a glass payable in advance, or so much a pint if taken
by the quarter. The water is bottled and sent abroad, which is about as
good a joke as selling the Serpentine at so much a dozen, or getting rid of
the Thames at 2d. the tumbler. On the 1st of November, 1755, the water
became suddenly red, and nobody could tell why. Our own opinion is,
that the fluid had a qualm of conscience for the qualms of another kind
it had occasioned, and was bleeding for the price that had been paid for it.
Going from the Hot-wells there is a beautiful walk called the Zig-zag to
Clifton Downs. Nature has made it worthy of the pencil, but cupidity is
fast dooming it to the pickaxe. At every turn of the romantic pass we
meet a most unromantic notice that “Stone MAY BE cut At so Mucii PER
Ton.” The authorities are selling their splendid scenery at about two-pence
a hundred-weight. The beauties of nature are being rapidly carted away
to repair the roads, and ravines are being knocked down without reserve
to the first bidder.
On the rock of St. Vincent is the Giant's Hole, which is about four feet
in height, so that the giant must either have been a very moderate-
sized phenomenon, or he must have been completely doubled up when he
occupied the hole that tradition has assigned to him. It is supposed that
the two sides of the rock were once united and were rent asunder by a
convulsion of Nature. Perhaps Nature was cutting her teeth at the time,
and if so, convulsions might have been expected. Nature is sometimes
subject to fits and starts—but MR. Wick offered “a soothing syrup" in
the shape of a legacy to erect a bridge to unite the two sides of the rock,
and thus heal the effect of Nature's convulsion. This suspension bridge
is a sort of rival to the one at Hungerford, with the exception that
Iłungerford has a man and a boy at work, while Clifton Suspension-Bridge
employs only an old woman. This lady takes care of the clothes-basket
which is slung on the rope, and affords the only means of transit.
In speaking of the Suspension-Bridge we must not pass over the ferry,
and nobody who has passed over it once will be in a hurry to do so a
second time. The ferry is church property, and the craft is the most
horrible specimen of priestcraft that can possibly be imagined. The ‘erry-
boat is a sort of coal barge cut down nearly to the water's edge, but there
are no divisions in it, and consequently a horse and cart occasionally trot
in amongst a crowd of passengers. The crew of the ferry-boat consists
sometimes of one man and sometimes of nobody, for when the tide is low,
people are left to scramble across as they can ; the captain of the ferry-
boat merely stopping them to take the toll from them, as if they had been
rowed across, instead of having walked it. The regulations of the ferry-
boat are very lax, and the passage is generally made amidst swearing,
smoking, and squeezing—none of which are prohibited.
Nevertheless, Clifton is a very charming place, and it is to be regretted
that in the struggle between Nature and the Town Council, Nature seems
to be getting decidedly the worst of it. The romantic rocks are having
several dreadful digs in the side, and the Town Council ought to be well
blown up themselves, for allowing the stone to be blown up by relentless
Baltpetre.
SONNET BY A PSEUDO.SCOTCHMAN.
I stood upon BEN PRIMRose. It was morn—
The wind was westerly; the day was fine.
Far in the distance gleamed Loch SERPENTINE,
Like patent-leather boot beneath the sun;
Hard by thy chesnut groves, GLEN KENSINGTON ;
Before me, like a giant steep'd in wine,
Or Kraken, slumb'ring on the Norway brine,
Enormous London lay. There was I born ;
Ay, there, within the echoes of Bow BELLs;
And when I gaze upon thy dome, SAINT PAUL,
And think of Clapham, IsLINGTON, and all,
With patriotic pride my bosom swells,
And I exclaim, with lip serenely curled,
“There's not a place like London in the world !”
Vit at the Palace.
In consequence of the fortunate convalescence of her Majesty, DR, Lo-
cock and i. FERGuson left their apartments in the Lancaster Tower
last week. An acquaintance of the latter doctor, not having been aware
of his departure, called to inquire after him, and one of the palace domes-
tics (a wag) has since written on the door of the vacated apartment, “Da.
FERGuson don't lodge here any longer.”
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE NINTH.-of Estates in sEveRALTY, Joint TENANCY,
REMAINDER, AND common.
Of the four ways of holding an estate described in the title of this
chapter, the first is decidedly the best, because the holder of an estate in
severalty has it all to himself; like the Member of Parliament who got up
to address the House, which made every one run out of it.
An estate in joint tenancy is where two or more persons have one and
the same interest, by the same conveyance, at the same time, and held by
the same possession. First, they must have one interest; though, if they
quarrel, they will probably have had a dilemma, which the wisdom of the
law does not guard against. It must come to them by one convey-
ance; but whether that “one conveyance” shall be the Parcels' Delivery
Company, or the railroad, does not appear to signify. Joint tenants must
have one and the same title: but semble, that a nobleman would not
refuse an estate in joint tenancy with the Lord Mayor, whose title
cannot be one and the same with that of the peer, who would nevertheless
“take,” as the legal phrase characteristically expresses it. There must
also be unity of time to constitute a joint tenancy; but it does not appear
that a mere difference in their watches would defeat the estate, nor would
one of them being in London, and the other at Bath, where there is a varia-
tion of some minutes in the clocks, prevent them from having an estate in
joint tenancy. If this rule as to time were very stringent, the property
in the parish of St. Clement's would be placed, by the irregular conduct of
its very eccentric horloge, in constant jeopardy. The joint tenants must
have one and the same possession; or, as the law term has it, they must
be all seised at once—for the law is so very fond of “seizing,” that it ap-
plies the term to the acquisition of property, and it is certainly a word
that expresses pretty accurately the law's own mode of acquisition.
Out of joint tenancy arises the doctrine of survivorship, by which the
longest liver is entitled to the whole estate; but if they both die at the
same moment—by shipwreck, for instance—we should like to know which
of their two heirs would take the property. It is probable, that if the ocean
swallowed up the joint tenants, the estate itself would be gulped down
by the tempestuous sea of Chancery. It is an important question, how a
joint tenancy may be severed or destroyed, for joint tenants may wish to
part, and one may make the other very disagreeable. For instance,
suppose two people are joint tenants in a house, and they both want to
live in it. As it belongs equally to both, neither could prevent the other;
and if both wanted to occupy the best room, or both insisted on putting
up their feet on the bars of the same fireplace, endless litigation would be
the consequence.
The law, foreseeing this sort of thing, provides that there may be a writ
of partition, and the jointure may be dissolved ; “for Chancery,” saith
Coke, “can dissolve, that is to say, it can swallow and digest, melt ol
otherwise make away, with anything.”
Estates in coparcenary are such as descend to two or more persons,
as, where a man's next heirs are females, the estate goes to them all, all
arrangement the law delights in, because it is probable that handing au
estate over to the ladies is almost equivalent to making it immediately the
subject of litigation. Coparceners have not the benefit of survivorship,
which is, perhaps, a rule made out of consideration to the fair sex, who
could not enjoy an estate, if living to grow old were one of the conditions
of getting it.
Tenants in common are such as have different interests in the same
estate, as in the celebrated case of the oyster, where the clients came in
for the shells, and the lawyer took the fish. Here they were all tenants
in common of the native, but the oyster was a sort of separate intereºt
carved out of the shells, which the clients held as long as they found it
convenient.
It may be as well, before concluding this . to remark that the
illustration of the oyster is not taken from the well-known rule in Sheller's
case; but to seize the fish, and give the shell, is the rule in almost every
case where it can possibly be acted on.
Military Intelligence.
CoRPoral J. Silk BuckinghAM is in the Isle of W. recruiting for
the service of the British and Foreign Destitute. Volunteers are very
scarce, as he offers no gratuity, and the rations and pay of the service are
not at all liked. Pressing, too, has been tried on a large scale, but not a
single raw member caught. The Corporal returns to town in a few days,
as there have been several deserters in his absence from the Destitute
depôt in Hanover Square.
OUT OF HARM'S WAY.
AFTER the late exhibition of bad firing at Tangiers, we should say that,
in the event of a naval engagement with France, the safest place for
English ships would be in front of the French guns.

TUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
----------
THE Members of the London Mission beg respectfully to inform
Christian philanthropists in general, and the religious world in par-
ticular, that encouraged by the applause which rewarded their
last entertainment at Exeter-hall, in the matter of PRItch And,
Que EN Poman E, and the French, they have made arrangements to
continue their performances for the further enlightenment of the
heathen, and the pacification of the world at large.
Profoundly touched with the truth of the political axiom that the
best warranty of peace is to make every preparation for war—
believing that the best security against the discharge of a gun is to
keep it continually at half-cock,-the London Mission confidently
invite the public to witness the extraordinary efforts they have made
for the perpetuity of peace, and the growth of brotherly love among
all nations.
The London Mission are in treaty with her Majesty's Government
for the purchase of the bomb-ship Infernal (to be re-christened the
Iſomeycomb), in which it is their intention to visit Tahiti, and, if neces-
sary, to argue every point of Christianity with the French at point-
blank. The immortal NEwton declared that with all he had done,
he seemed to himself no more than a child who had picked up a few
shells by the great ocean of truth. The London Mission flatter
themselves that their shells will be found very different from those
of Newton ; and their truth very different from his truth.
Pending the negotiation for the bomb-ship, the Mission have
purchased a forty-two pounder, and earnestly invite the public to
witness the extreme skilfulness with which they load and fire. They
have discovered that the very best wadding is supplied by tracts and
sermons; they help to make the loudest noise, and, in many instances,
very considerably increase the smoke. It is also confidently believed
that cannon-balls inscribed with the words Peace, Lore, or Charity,
do much more execution than vulgar, unblessed iron, discharged by
| the ignorant laity.
THE LONDON MISSION.—LOADING THE GUN AT ExETER
HALL.
The London Mission do not arrogate to their own untaught efforts
the gunnery perfection at which they have arrived. Certainly not.
Since their last meeting at Exeter Hall, several of the brethren have
taken daily lessons at Woolwich Marshes, under the direction of
distinguished officers of artillery. The Reverend MR. SMITH has
especially distinguished himself, having with a rocket split a quill
tooth-pick at an inconceivable distance.
It was the intention of the London Mission to have exhibited their
gunnery in Lori's Cricket Ground, but that place having been pre-
viously engaged for the performances of the Ioway INDIANs, the
Mission had too much Christian consideration for the war-song and
war-dance, even to repine at being anticipated by their unconverted
brothers.
The object of the Mission in calling upon the public, and the re-
ligious world in particular, to witness their artillery practice is, that,
upon their shown success, they may the more confidently ask sub-
scriptions from the peaceful for the purchase of the Infernal bomb
above-named.
The rapidity with which the cannon is loaded and discharged will, it
is believed, at once ensure all needful support.
Modestly certain of the funds necessary to buy the Infernal, the
London Mission cannot forego the present opportunity of stating that
they are already open to the application of those peace-loving men
who would serve as volunteers in the expedition. The officers being
already named, foremast men only are required; and these must
have served the office of clerk at least three years to be eligible. A
few cabin-boys who have received medals at their Sunday-schools will
be received. There will also be an opening for half-a-dozen pew-
openers as cockpit-nurses. -
The chair will be taken at 11 a.m. The gun will be loaded at half.
past. Firing to begin precisely at noon.
*
TMore Toestruction.
The WARNER shell and long-range sink into nothingness compared to
a recent discovery made by Colonel. Sibthorp. After much pondering,
the gallant Colonel has absolutely invented a pocket earthquake. The
destructive agent is so portable, that, as the advertisements say, “the
most timid female may carry it in her reticule.”
A Reasonable Request.

upon examination to be really exceedingly moderate, for in demanding

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGI, ANI).
(From our Folkstone Correspondent.)
E regret to say that the
Gallic Cock has again been
crowing over the British
Bull-dog in a manner that
complicates the question
between the two countries
much more than hitherto.
The British Bull-dog, in
the person of a commer-
cial traveller by the Dover
Railway, applied to the
Gallic Cock—represented by a French waiter at the Pavilion Hotel at
Folkstone—for a bed, when the Gallic Cock, with a grin of malicious
satisfaction, announced that every bed was full, to the immense annoyance
of the British Bull-dog, who went on by the next train to Dover.
It will hardly be believed that, notwithstanding this occurrence, the
harbour of Folkstone is sometimes left in the middle of the day, when the
steamers are all out, with no other force than a casual collier to protect
British interests. The landlord of the Hotel is a Frenchman, and, of
course, secretly devoted to France; so that the English may be put into
the top-rooms, get the worst places at the table d'hôte, and obtain the least
attention when they ring the bell; while the foreigner, arriving from per-
fidious Boulogne, is well boarded, lodged, and waited on. British blood
will, of course, boil furiously, and every English pulse assume the violence
of the sledge-hammer at the contemplation of these facts; yet SiR Robert
PEEL sleeps in his bed, and the EARL of Abendeen takes his wine after
dinner as usual.
SIR JAMES GRAHAM'S PUPILS.
MR. Punch,--I am one of the suspended letter-carriers about
whom there has been such a fuss in the newspapers; and I, with my
brethren in affliction, knowing the impartiality of your judgment,
address you, that fair-play may be done to all of us.
We are charged with opening letters addressed to Lord BEN-
Tinck, MR. TATTERsALL, and to other horse-racing gentlemen.
Well, we confess it : we broke open their letters—every one that
fell into our hands—but we did it, as SIR JAMEs GRAHAM broke
the letters of other people,_all for the sake of public peace and
public morals. I should like to know what’s the use of high people,
Queen's Ministers, and all that, if we poor small folks ar'n't to copy
and learn from them :
Sin JAMEs said that what he did, he did for the peace of the
world and the well-doing of society. He had heard or dreamed of
cut-throat conspiracies, and so he went to work and opened right
and left. And what's the consequence Why, all sorts of good.
They do say that the Italians who were all lately shot in the back,
were only found out by the news that was sent of them from the
Home Office—news picked out of opened letters to Italians here in
London. Isn't this something comfortable to think of Doesn't it
do an Englishman's heart good to know this
Well, sir, I and my fellow-suspended took SIR JAMEs—good pious
man as he is—for our pattern; and knowing that there was such a deal
of roguery, and hedging, and hocussing, and all that going on upon
the turf–we opened all sporting letters that we might know all
about the wickedness, and, like Sin JAMEs, make the most of it.
All we wanted, sir, was to put honest folks upon their guard as to
what was going on ; just as good Sin JAMEs broke seals only to let
the EMPERoa of Russia and the KING of NAPLEs know the wicked-
ness that was being got up against 'em. I repeat it, we merely
wanted to find out roguery, to make the most of it.
Well, sir, and for this, we are to have our characters taken away—
to be suspended—to have our mouths deprived of our honest bread,
and to have all sorts of bad names given us in the newspapers;
whilst SIR JAMEs GRAHAM keeps his seat and his salary, and his
character—or all that remains of it—to boot.
Well, this comes of being conceited, and copying one's betters!
For the future, as I want to do right, I shall just do the contrary of
Sin JAMEs ; and, in the meantime beg, Mr. Punch, that you will do
all you can for A SUs pen DED Post MAN.

an order, carried out with all characteristic zeal and fidelity ly
Douaniers and Postmasters, by which means every number of Punch'r
inimitable and cosmopolite journal found in the possession of a
steam-boat passenger has been seized and impounded, as though it
were another Infernal Machine in handsome type—by which means
every copy has been stopped at the French Post Office (to the all but
irreparable loss and most poignant grief of the defrauded sub-
scriber),
Punch is hereupon determined to engage at any cost,
A FEW BOLD SMUGGLERS,
that his Journal may continue to disseminate civilisation throughout
benighted France; and, if possible, to touch the hearts of the natives
with a true sense of human glory, converting them from the false
worship of blood and fire, and gathering them into a brotherhood of
peaceful men. Hence, smuggling—at the worst, a venial eccentricity
—exercised in the cause of benevolence and Punch, becomes an
occupation for the Philanthropist and the Philosopher; and the man
who successfully introduces our sheet into France, may, for all time
forward, consider himself a human benefactor. Ile is the missionary
of peace among the drum-beating heathen.
It would ill-become the character of Punch—now, happily, known
to the universe for his plain outspeaking—to affect an ignorance of
the cause which has made him distasteful to that fortifying mouarch,
Louis Philippe. No, no ; Punch is fully aware that his well-meant
epistle to Joinville—that letter, written with a dove's-quill dipped
in attar of roses—was vitriolic acid to the royal palate. He knows,
too, that his exposure of the Royal Beggarman, who talks of his sons
and daughters as a mendicant talks of his sores, that he may gull and
pillage the unwary, the while he is padded with greasy bank i.otes
beneath his rags and tatters, Punch knows that his exposure of
royal avarice has called down upon him the prohibitory vengeance of
KING Dives, detected, as Punch detected him, mumming as Louis
PHILIPPE LAzARus.
And, therefore, is the weekly sheet of Punch prohibited throughout
free and sunny France And, therefore, does Punch appeal to the
gallantry and magnanimity of the smuggler, that, by the beneficent
aid of the wiles of contraband, he may still, in despite of Louis
PHILIPPE, exercise a high Moral Influence over his unhappy sub-
jects. He, it has been said, is a benefactor to man, who makes two
ears of wheat grow where one only grew before. What, then, will be
His reputation, who, by the genius of smuggling, causes two numbers
of Punch to circulate in France, in places where one has been prohi-
bited Who shall enter into the sublimating feelings of that man
Not Punch : no—it would be presumptuous.
Ladies and Gentlemen desirous of acting as smugglers to Punch
are requested to apply at his office from Monday next to Saturday
inclusive, between the hours of 8 and 8; or to the Editor, who, with
two of his agents, is now residing in the Rue St. Honoré, Paris. A
preference will be given to ladies; Punch having, in his various con-
tinental trips, observed that the softer and more innocent sex smuggle
with an ease, a graceful audacity, far beyond the power of that
sophisticated creature—Man.
Handsome terms will be given to Members of Parliament—also to
a few members of the Dramatic Authors' Society.

Letter xix.
FROM A COUNTRY ACTOR TO A LONDON MANAGER,
FOR AN ENGAGEMENT.
DEAR SIR,
It may probably have escaped your recol-
lection, that in the year , you did me the high
honour to pay me a very flattering compliment on my acting—im-
perfect as it was — of Catesby. You then said, sir, and I have
treasured the words—that should it be ever your destiny to manage
a London Theatre, you would be only too happy to make me one of
your little set. Yes, sir, little set were the words ! I am, indeed, sir,
most happy to find by the newspapers that that time has arrived.
It is a great day for the profession. Such an event has long been
wanted ; and at length Shakspere—that really great creature —will
have fair play done him. How happy, indeed, shall I be, if per-
mitted in the smallest degree to assist in that national triumph 1
To return, sir, to the compliment you so kindly paid to my Catesby.
That, sir, was ten years ago, and—but “on their own merits modest
men are dumb"— I flatter myself that an unceasing attention to my
profession, and more especially to the advice you were pleased to
give me, has made me not less worthy of applause. You may forget
that advice—I never shall. The Horatio had been arrested coming
to the theatre, and I studied the part from scene to scene. It was
where Hamlet discovers Ophelia's death, and falls upon Horatio’s neck.
Pardon me ! but can I ever forget the point—the telling point—you
made there Never ! It was then you said to me “My good sir, I
have been much pleased with your attention—very much pleased—
you are in the rough, very much in the rough at present; in fact you
know nothing: but keep your eye on me—do as I do—exactly as I
do—and you can't be wrong.” From that moment, sir, I set you up
as my model, and—but friends are partial—I have been told that the
resemblance between our styles of acting is extraordinary.
You may possibly have forgotten me, and therefore will excuse it,
if I remind you that my figure is good, indeed much improved since
we met. My voice is powerful; its intonation—I have been told—
like KEAN's (of course I mean EDMUND), my face expressive, and
capable of any sort of making up—and for my study, I can swallow
anything. With all this, sir, I shall be very happy to come in as one
of the team. Yes, sir, all I want is opportunity; the chance of play-
ing before a London audience, quite convinced that the rest is in
myself, and must come out.
On the other side I forward a list of parts. I have gained—I may
say it—great reputation in the provinces in all of them. The
Stranger is a favourite bespeak part of mine—and my Claude Melnotte
a great hit with all the boarding schools. Some critics have given
the palm to my Macbeth, and some to my Jonathan Bradford. If I may be
allowed to have any opinion, I think them both equally good in their
way, though, I need not say to you, requiring different touches from
the artist. Still, he must be something of a painter who can use the
delicate camel-hair of that great creature Shakspere, and the four-
pound brush of the melodramatist. My sailors, too, have been
accounted remarkably good; especially at the seaports. I have
played William in the Surrey trash of Black-Eyed Susan, in a way to
make T. P. CookE shake in his shoe-buckles. I could say more, but
it is painful to speak of one's self. I therefore take the liberty of
forwarding with this, a small book in which you will find a great
number of criticisms, carefully pasted from the first provincial papers
of the day. They have been preserved by my wife; for though not
insensible of the power of the press, I myself make it a point never
to look into a newspaper.
Speaking of my wife, can you find a corner for her 1 A clever
little chambermaid—sings well and all that—and a faultless breeches
figure. It is often difficult for a husband to speak of a wife's merits,
but sometimes it must be done. The acting of Mas. Wilkins is
wonderfully natural. She has it born in her what other actresses
have too often to labour for. She has such impulse! The French
actors have a better word for it—abandon—yes, abandon is the word.
Well, sir, other actresses may obtain this from art; now Mrs. Wii.-
KINs has it all by nature.
I have not spoken of salary, nor will I. On that point, sure am I,
we shall be unanimous. All I want is London gaslight, for, indeed,
I am tired of acting as I have too long acted, under a bushel. In a
word, sir, “I am a poor man who'd fain grow richer,” and hoping to
be—in your old and long-prized words—“one of your little set,”
I remain, yours truly, ,
BULcAz Exi Wilkins.
LETTER Xx.
The MANAGER'S ANSWER.
SIR,
It has been my misfortune to play with so many provincial
Catesbys—a part, by the way, singularly neglected in all country
theatres—that, at the date you name, it is almost impossible for me
to have any recollection of your merits. I think, however, you were
then the sucking actor who entirely marred my fifth act. I think
Wii. KINs was the name. If you are, I am glad to hear that you are
improved; though I would rather have that fact certified by any
other authority. If, however, you are the Wilkins I mean, you have
at least this consolation—worse you cannot be. It is quite true that I
have entered on the arduous task of management, and I cannot consent
to make that task more irksome by adding to my difficulties, on the
strength of a promise made I knew not when—where—or to whom.
I am afraid that frequent acts of civility when playing in the pro-
vinces have been sadly misinterpreted ; for you are at least the twen-
tieth applicant that has applied to me upon the encouragement of
some vague compliment meant for nothing—nothing I assure you.
And now, sir, I will give you a small piece of valuable counsel.
You are an actor (at least you say so); well, never promise what you
will do when you become a manager. Only praise an author's piece,
and regret that you have no power to bring it out—(if you had, hai
how happy you should be )—well, sir, you praise it and think you
have done with it. Why, in ten or fifteen years' time you become a
manager, and back comes the piece to you with your own commen-
datory letter, and the pest of an author claiming the fulfilment of
your implied service. It might be difficult, but were my time to come
over again, I should in these matters endeavour to speak the truth.
Never say what you’ll do when you become a manager. It is just
like a Prince of Wales promising what he'll do when he becomes
king : flummery, sir—polite flummery.
With your great natural qualifications of figure, face, and voice,
it would only distress me to see such fine advantages thrown away
upon mere utility, could I even offer you that—and anything beyond
is entirely impossible. You are not a man for the team ; no, but a
racer that should start upon his own account. There is, no doubt,
a plate for you somewhere, though not at my theatre. -
Your list of parts is certainly very long. You seem to have played
in everything, except one piece—The Baslful Man.
I have not read the criticisms you sent, but I at once detected the
source of their eulogy—tobacco and gin and water. Such criticisms
must be valuable, for they have every appearance of having cost you
a great deal.
Your praise of Mrs. W 11.xins does honour to your feelings as a
man and a husband; but the chambermaids are filled.
Your obedient Servant,
Magnus PUFF.

JOINVILLE AT HERNE BAY.
The French papers continue to threaten invasion. Should a casus
belli occur, we understand from the same undoubted authority that
supplies exclusive intelligence to the Herald and Standard, that Herne
Bay, like Mogador, will be the first place destroyed by French
cannon., Imagine the bulletin of Joinville—“Herne Bay est
écrasé !” From other sources we learn that, out of gallantry to Mrs.
Thwait Es, the benevolent foundress of that marine city, it will not be
destroyed. No ; Joinville knows too well the value of the place,
and will spare it Once possessed of the pier, he will, by means
of the two guns that now so gallantly defend it, command the
Channel. He has only to sit in the drawing-room of the Dolphin
Hotel, and, by the aid of the respected landlord's very excellent
telescope, mark out every merchantman as she passes, and our trade
is destroyed. If Herne Bay is not the key of the Thames, it is at least
the pick-lock; and France, with such a pick-lock in her hand, may
in a very little time enter the Tower of London 1
As journalists, as patriots, we are bound to give all the intelli-
gence within our power. As to its truth, we leave that to be disco-
vered by idle people, who have nothing better to do. Our first
business is to fill our paper. We learn, then, that Herne Bay, once
possessed by Joinville, transports will immediately land troops.
We can imagine the frantic bravery of the two policemen of the
Bay-(who, as they wear no figures on their collars, may, although
two, be said to be numberless)—we can imagine each of them a
Cocles on a British bridge, madly defying the invading Gaul. Vain,
vain is their valour. The policemen—as we are positively assured
-will be shot through the body, and the toll-gate successfully
carried; the lives of the toll-keepers being graciously spared on
their delivering into the hands of the conqueror all their half.
pence 1
Paunce Joinville will then establish his head-quarters at the
Dolphin. Insultingly wiping his brow with a copy of the Times, he
will sit down, and, in a tone of heroic derision, call for “a bifstick
and a pot of port-er.” These things discussed, he will immediately
command Lilly, the postman, to be seized, in order to cut off the
too rapid communication with Canterbury.
The troops will soon land, Joinville having sent for a large force
of cavalry, which, from the peculiar openness of the streets of Herne
Bay, can act with the greatest efficiency. Many of the streets, too,
have this double advantage ; they not only supply room but forage
—the potato crops being excellent.
The authorities, including the town-crier and the post-mistress,
will be immediately seized, but, if possible, respected. They will be
confined in the bathing-machines; and both doors being nailed up,
victuals will be supplied to them through the windows.
All the boarding-schools will be invested; and at least one officer
quartered on each. PRINcE Jouxville, however, with those human-
izing feelings which make war so very respectable, will quarter at
no school any officer who has not the true Parisian accent, so that
the French studies of the pupils may not be deteriorated.
Punch—trembling for his own Herne Bay—has visited and sur-
veyed it. Doing nothing by halves, he has himself sounded for
anchorage. In all candour, he cannot say much for the bottom, but
the water is excellent.
Punch does not look upon Herne Bay as lost, if Government will
only attend to his advice. We have the Cinque Ports: there is
much in a name; let there be the Six Ports, and let Herne Bay make
up the half-dozen :
Punch also suggests a most efficient mode of defence. The world .
—says the author of Coningsby—is ruled by the Hebrew mind. Now
let an officer of the Jewish persuasion be in readiness on the pier
(by-the-by there generally is one), and when Joinville lands, let
the said officer immediately serve him with a copy of a writ. Gene-
rals who have faced many pounders, have been known to run from
writs.
THE ROYAL RODS.
The papers state that two splendid fishing-rods have been presented to
PRINCE ALBERT and the PRINCE of WALEs. The construction of the rod
intended for the infant Prince is quite different from what has been stated.
It is composed of a number of slender twigs of that ornament of our woods
and forests, the birch; bound together at one end, so as to form a handle,
with gold and silver wire. We may also assert that it has not been put
into the PRINCE of Wales's hands at all; but into those of his Royal
Papa ; who, we believe, has for the present entrusted it to those of Laor
LyTTElton, with directions to use it when necessary.
A Remonstrance.
How can'st thou, Punch, with pen of gaſ.
The Mansion-house assail,
And hint that in its festive hall
The ancient glories fail?
Its name unchanged, its rank increased,
E’en satire must allow ;
Last year Lord HUMPHREY spread the feast,
Duke IIUMPHREY rules it now.
GENERosity REwARDED.—PRINCE Joinville and the French gunners,
who so distinguished themselves at Tangier, have been appointed houarary
members of the Royal Humane Society.

THE French, having possessed themselves of Algiers, have in the
most praiseworthy manner set about cultivating the soil. This is
nothing but right—the proper payment of a debt due to dear, ill-used
mother earth. Having committed a hundred razzias (a new word
in the rich vocabulary of military glory,) upon the Moors, having
burnt their crops, destroyed their villages, and carried away every-
thing that could be made into rations, they have now turned farmers
themselves, in the sincerity of their compunction determining to eat
of the fruits of their own labour—the fruits of pillage having become
scarce and so uncertain. To follow out this noble intention, num-
bers of model farm-houses have been constructed in France, and
shipped for Algeria. We give a correct sketch of one of these
abodes of rustic peace and happiness, and are furthermore enabled
to lay before the reader the translation of a lettor, sent by a cul-
tivator of the soil to his kindred in France. It is valuable, as
showing that whatever the difficulties of the farming interest may
be in England, they are, nevertheless, not to be compared to the
agricultural struggle in Africa.
My DEAR PARENTs, August 25, 1844, Mon Repos, Algiers.
Your kind letter, strange to say, found me alive. You ask me
to send you an account of our Model Farm. I inclose a picture of it, by
which you will see the happy security we dwell in. The farm is sur-
rounded by a stockade, and we mount not less than fifty forty-two
pounders; these are constantly double loaded with grape of the very
best vintage. Thus, our guns bear upon our fields, if nothing else does.
Indeed, everything about us may be said to be shooting, except the crops.
Still I do not despair. Two months ago we ploughed two hundred Arabs
into a field of four acres, and find they are coming up very nicely in
turnips. For agricultural glory, there is nothing like bone-dust.

Indeed, it is amazing to see how glory blesses us in this country. We
feed the Gallic cock upon small-shot; and, strange to say, the hens lay
nothing but bullets. Indeed, such is the vigilance of the Arabs, that we
are compelled to stand to our guns at milking time, and feed the pigs with
fixed bayonets. We are, however, exercising the milkmaids in platoon
firing, and trust they are quite able to take the field with the cows, now
that the guns, which they are to carry, have been provided us.
We yesterday held a court-martial on the sentinel who mounted guard
at the ducks' house; a party of the enemy having scaled the wall at night,
and carried off our only brood of ducklings. The drake and duck were
found with their throats cut. Were there ever such barbarous villains
as these Arabs: The sentinel was shot this morning at six, with all the
honours. Although the villains stole our ducks, they fortunately missed the
onions ; I say fortunately, for they might have found, at least, a rope apiece,
We are, however, preparing for a grand operation. We have deposited
an immense quantity of gunpowder under the dunghill. We purpose to
appear off our guard—shall suffer the enemy to scale our stockade,
plant their banners on our dunghill, and then—as they think, in the
moment of victory—blow them to atoms . Thus may true glory be
obtained, like mushrooms, even from a dunghill !
You will, from the above, judge of the charming excitement of our
country life; of the delightful employment of cultivating beet-root and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE WOODEN-SHOE AND THE BUFFALO-
INDIANS.*
LL travellers agree in stating that the
powerful tribe of Wooden-Shoe In-
dians occupies a large tract of terri-
tory on the Great Salt-water Lake,
opposite the island inhabited by the
Itoast-Buffalo tribe. The two tribes
have been at war from time imme-
morial; the Wooden-Shoes hating
and cursing the Roast-Buffaloes, and
the Buffalo having, in turn, the
greatest contempt for his neighbour
across the Lake.
The Wooden-Shoes are particu-
larly bitter against the Buffaloes,
because the latter are the only tribe
in America over whom the Shoes have not obtained an advantage.
The Shoes are the most violent and quarrelsome people of the
Continent: they live by robbery and pillage : they are little skilled
in trade; hence, probably, their dislike to it, and their extreme
fondness for war.
A Chief, to have any authority over them, has hitherto been in a
manner obliged to lead them to the war-path; for, when left to them-
selves, they are so quarrelsome that they are sure to be cutting each
other's throats; and the Sachems wisely consider it is best that their
braves should be employed against the enemy than in the ruinous
practice of internecine slaughter. Many moons ago, there was an
unlucky Chief of the Wooden-Shoes, the Manchon Blanc or White Muff
by name, who was of rather a peaceful disposition. The Wooden.
Shoes scalped him and his wife, lifted the war-hatchet, burst into
the territories of the neighbouring tribes, and such was the vigour
of their onset, that at first all the Continent was subdued by them,
and made to pay tribute to the victorious Wooden-Shoes.
They were led, at this proud period of their conquests, by a chief
who was called in their language, Le Petit Caporal, a warrior of un-
daunted courage and amazing savageness and cunning. He conquered
all the Continent; and, though of a -low origin himself, carried off
from the Great Father of the Pipe-Smoking Indians a daughter, whom
he brought home to his wigwam, putting away his first wife for the
purpose. But the successes of the Petit Caporal were of brief dura-
tion. The tribes allied themselves against him; and, headed by the
Roast-Buffalo Indians, whom he had never been able to master, they
overcame and utterly annihilated him.
They held a council after the victory, and determined on restoring
the government of the Wooden-Shoes to a younger brother of the
Sachem who had been scalped by the tribe. The Wooden-Shoes,
however, indignant that foreigners should intermeddle in the con-
cerns of their government, determined to get rid of the family so
imposed upon them ; and, though they allowed the first chief (he was
called the Fat Turtle) to reign and die unmolested, they took occasion
to seize upon his brother, who succeeded the Turtle, and turned him
out of the government, and out of their territory.
We now come to the chief subject of the present memoir—the
famous old chief who has been called by his countrymen La Vieille
Poire, and who has reigned over them for fifteen years.
La Vieille Poire was a relation of the Fat Turtle, and his family (a
younger branch) had incessantly been quarrelling with the elder for
the chieftainship. The Poire's father conspired against the old chief,
who was scalped in the outbreak, and had hoped to seize the govern-
ment when the Vieux Manchon was murdered, but the people scalped
the pair of them; on which the Poire, who was then a young warrior
distinguishing himself in the trail of the enemy along with the other
braves of the Wooden-Shoes, fled away from his native tribe, having
no fancy to leave his top-knot to dry on the pole alongside of his
father's.
Vieille Poire then rubbed off the war-paint of the Wooden-Shoes,
and joined the Buffalo Indians, tattooing himself as much as possible
after the manner of that tribe. He lived about among the Buffaloes
as well as he could, and finally came back to his own tribe with the
Fat Turtle, when that chief was restored. In the delight of his
heart, the Turtle forgave the Poire all the evil his father had done,
and restored to him the paternal wigwam. The people revolted for

Jones.
a second time against Fat Turtle, when the Poiré persuaded them that
he was the very man for their purpose, and accordingly they elected
him their Sachem.
Since then the Poire has attained a position vastly too secure to be
ever ousted from it, and now governs the Wooden-Shoe tribe in spite
of themselves. As they were a very rebellious, captious race, the
Poire surrounded the principal village of the Wooden-Shoes with
blockhouses, which he filled with his own braves, who are ready to
fire upon the other Wooden-Shoes, if they make the least disturbance
or revolt.
In the last 15 years, the Poire's children have grown up, have
taken squaws of their own, and the papoosey now begin to swarm
about their lodges.
Last year the Poire sent one of his sons, called the Belle Poule,
or Fat IIcm, on a visit to the Buffaloes. They showed him their
Island, and he thought it was very rich, abounding in game, firs,
and wealth of every kind—the young braves who went in the canoe
with the Belle Poule, looked upon the Virgins of the Buffaloes and
panted for the day when they should set their wigwams blazing,
scalp the young men of the tribe, and carry off the girls to their own
lodges.
The young men of the Buffaloes—who have been thinking too
much of their hunting and trapping, their fishing and trading, and
who, from a long habit of beating the Wooden-Shoes, have got to
despise them perhaps too much—are meanwhile beginning to awake
and get angry too. “Shall we who crushed their fathers,” they say,
“allow these little savage Wooden-Shoes to bluster and threatent Are
they to go on for ever whirling their tomahawks, singing their war-
songs, firing their rifles within an inch of our noses, and the Buffaloes
never to show their horns?” -
To this, there is an Old White Bison among the Buffaloes who
replies. He is very old, very white, very wise, and very brave—
perhaps the bravest chief now known in the world — for he has
been more often on the trail of the Wooden-Shoes than any known
warrior, and he it was who took the scalp of the Great Brave of the
Wooden-Shoes, the cruel and terrible Petit Caporal. “The Wooden-
Shoes,” says he, “sing and chatter like women; the Buffaloes are
men. He who is silent can see and hear better than he who talks.
He who is still can take better aim than he who is running. If the
Wooden-Shoes dig up the hatchet, the Buffaloes will take it up ; and
they know how to wield it better than any brave among the Wooden-
Shoes. But it is better that their young warriors should brag, than
that our lodges should burn. The yelping of curs only frightens
children. The Buffaloes are men. I have spoken. Hech 1”

At this interesting period the document kindly furnished us by
MR. Jones ceases; and we know not what was the cause of the dis-
pute between the two tribes. He states that the accompanying
savage design, depicting the war-dance of these wild men, con-
tains pretty accurate portraits of the chief of the Wooden-Shoes
(Louis PHILIPPE); of Belle Poule (Joinville), his son ; of the
Solemn Owl (Guizot), the chief Medicine of the tribe, a grave and
peaceful chief; of the little Cock-Sparrow (Thiens), a very savage
and mischievous little Wooden-Shoe, who has never been on
the war-path himself, but has a great skill in inflaining his com-
rades; and of the Old Bald Eagle (SouLT), a great warrior of the
tribe, who has often engaged with the Old White Bison of the Buf-
faloes. The Old Bison has had the better of him in all their battles,
and has taken his top-feathers several times—hence the barrenness of
his poll at present. But the two old Braves respect each other very
much nevertheless, and know too much about war to plunge into it
hastily, like some of the young braves of either side.

PUNCH*S POLKA.
EALLY the dancing world abounds with Polkas.
They are so numerous that it would take
a Polka Encyclopaedia to enumerate them
all. Jullien has a Polka for nearly every
day in the month, which he names after
the persons by whom, or the squares,
lanes, or alleys where, they were first
danced. His Polka de Mdlle. Polyphema
Hopkins is certainly superior to his Polka
de Hanway-yard. As the Polka seemed
to be in everybody's mouth, Punch
thought he might as well try his foot at one, but wishing to be, as he
always is, unique, he sent the original Polka, -as invented by the
“Bohemian Nobleman,” A. D. 1843,-to BARON NATHAN, to have it ana-
lysed, so as to avoid any of the numerous adulterations of this much-
deteriorated dance. The following are the component parts discovered
in the Polka by that greatest Terpsichorean Liebig of the age, the
BARoN NATHAN :—
Cracovienne . - - - - - . 31.3%
Jim Crow . - - - - - - 24
Cachuca . - - - - - - . 1543
Waltz, Galopade, Sauteuse, &c. . - - 13
loway-Indian Dance - - - 9
College Hornpipe. - - - - 7.3%
Minuet de la Cour . - - - 0

In the compounding of Our Polka, we have studiously avoided the
deleterious ingredients of the above analysis. Every step of it is deeply
imbued with the sublimate of Polka. The directions for using it are very
simple. When it is taken, it is to be well shaken, and the dose to be
repeated every evening, at the interval of half an hour, according to the
state of the Polka patient. We will warrant it to keep in any drawing-room.
ILLUMINATIONS ON PRINCE ALBERT'S BIRTH-DAY.
PUBLIC BUILDINGs.
The Waithman Column.-A soft glowing red light, fed by a piece of
tobacco embodded in a small white bowl of clay. The light was attended
to by the waterman on duty at the cab-stand.
The Monument at King's Cross.-A continued succession of candles
up to midnight, beginning in the beer-shop below, and finishing at about
twelve in the camera obscura above, which serves at night as the bedroom
of the proprietor.
The Nelson Column.-A transparency of the EMPERoR of Russia–
with the committee at his feet, thanking him for the £500. The boards
round the column embellished with the fresco of a Greenwich pensioner,
begging, drawn extremely fine. Motto—“Dinner forget.”
PALACEs.
Buckingham.—A beautiful transparency of ToM THUMB—and medal-
lions, surrounded with gold-coloured lamps, of GRisi, STRAuss, Thalberg,
PERs1AN1, and an Ojibbeway. Victoria, as FAME, crowning them with
bank notes. A small statue of “ShakspeaRE compressed," just visible in
the distance.
PUBLIC OFFICES.
The Seal Office in Inner Temple Lane.—A succession of lamps
(three) rising, one above the other, up the entire staircase of the building,
and forming, with the windows, a transparency of remarkable softness.
The Office of First Fruits.—A highly illuminated early gooseberry.
The How Street Police-Office.—At the door, a lantern thrown out in
strong relief on a girdle of black leather.
shops.
Mr. Moon's, Threadneedle Street.—The gas in the shop not turned off
till ten, illuminating seventeen portraits of PRINCE ALBERT dedicated to
the QUEEN, and forty of the Queen dedicated to PRINCE ALBERT. The
effect of this arrangement was very pleasing, from its wonderful contrast,
each portrait presenting a different feature.
The THEATRES.
Victoria.-A row of baked-potato-boys, in front of the portico, with
their lighted cans.
Astley's:-The letters “P. A." here, over the Pit-door; and a transpa-
rency of Britannia, riding on seven horses, over the waves, towards the
temple of Immortality, with Widdicomb, as Time, standing, in hessians,
on the steps, to receive her.
PREPARATIONS FOR WAR.
The London Mission intend visiting the principal ports and towns of
England to preach peace. A recruiting serjeant accompanies them.
Every regiment has been presented with a facsimile copy of PRInck
ALBERT's Hat.
At the first outbreak in Canada, a printing press, with MR. Roebuck,
will be sent over to the insurgents. A free pardon and a pension to be
given to any one who survives his proclamations.
An “Ugly Brigade” will be formed as a body-guard for the Queen.
A celebrated Radical-Whig-Tory Ex-Chancellor is to be appointed the
Colonel. Americans are to have the privilege of enlisting.
Covent Garden Theatre is to be turned into barracks, and MR. CARTER,
with his wild beasts, is to have the command of the London Militia.
In the event of a disturbance in Ireland, O'Connell will be offered a
nsion twice the amount of his “rent,” or, if necessary, to be made
aster of the Mint. The Pacificator is to have a good appointment in
the War Office.
M. Thiers, and the French press, will be paid handsomely to write
strong Anglophobian articles; and the Dramatic Authors' Society will, as
a compensation for their trade being ruined by the stoppage of French
pieces, have the job of translating them.
The regimental bands are to be reinforced with musicians from
Jullirn's orchestra. Jullien himself, with his piccolo, will defend the
Bank.
The Punch Office will not be fortified, further than its having the usual
number of enthusiasts outside, blocking up the office and the whole Strand.
THE POLICE BOOT.
O! (we are obliged to begin thus, gentle reader, on account of
the graphic initial), an official advertisement has appeared,
offering to receive tenders for the supply of the Police with
boots. The mention of the word tender, in connexion with
the Police chaussure, ought, as ShakspeaRE expresses it, to
--~ breed a kind of remorse in the breast of the Home
Bºss Secretary—at least; if it is his place to see the men
º shod. We do not know who Sir JAMEs GRAHAM's
§ boot-maker is, and we do not care; but if the Wel-
lingtons of the Right Honourable Baronet are no
better made than the Bluchers of the corps which he controls, we should
think he must be a good patient of Mr. Eisenberg's ; and would respect-
fully ask how he is off for corn-plaster? Policemen; surely, must vary
with respect to their feet, like other mortals; but their boots (if boots
they may be called) are of two sorts only, the too small and the too large.
The latter class are by far the most numerous ; so that it is easy to
judge of a Policeman, as of Hercules, by his ſoot, which seems about
-
“This is about the MARK, I think?"
twice as big as anybody elses, and Er pede Policeman will become the
popular proverb. These boots, or rather boats, presumably consist of
leather; but they look as clumsy, awkward, and inflexible, as if they were
made of cast-iron. We hail as a symptom of improvement, the announce-
ment in the advertisement alluded to, that no guarantee is given for the
reception of the lowest tender.
USEFUL AND ORNAMENTAL. -
The French dispatches of the battle of Isly mention the capture of the
EMPERon's son's parasol 1 MARSHAL Bugeaud has claimed this for his own
use, as he thinks it will keep the laurels he has gathered in Algeria
from withering.

THE BROUGHAM PORTRAIT.
* We stated in our last, that Lord BRough AM intended to present his
portrait, in a plain frame, to every English attorney. We are now enabled
to give the picture, with a copy of the letter which accompanied it.
*DEAR —, “Brougham, August 25, 1844.
“Herewith you have my portrait, in a plain frame. It has often
been a matter of surprise to me, that whereas almost every attorney's
office is decorated with either a portrait of Lond ELLENBoRough, LoRD
Eldon, or some such worthy, that in no one instance did I ever see, or
was it ever made known to me, that the portrait of LoRD BRough AM was
ever similarly honoured. How is this?" After much pondering, I must
confess my inability to know, unravel, or discover, the cause of the omis-
sion. For have I not dedicated a life to a reform of the laws—have I not
for thirty years been cleansing the profession from the moral feculence
with which extortionate costs had defiled
it? I have enemies—thank Heaven' I
have enemies—but when all their malig-
nity is vented, this they must allow, that
HARRY BRough AM has done more to destroy
costs (those harpies that feed upon the
oor and the unfortunate) than any other
egislator from the time of Bacon. And,
therefore, is it most surprising that a por--
trait of BRough AM is never to be found in
an attorney's office
“Naturally anxious to remedy this
omission, I forward you the accompanying
print (like my late friend, O'Connell's) in
a plain frame. It is reckoned very much
like me—though, between ourselves, I think
it wants elevation: it has not a sufficiently
encyclopaedic stare.
“You will hang it, sir, in your office—you will, I trust, place it in a
favourable position, that your clerks, while making out your bills of costs,
may now and then raise an eye to my vera effigies, and, by so doing, never
forget how much the profession owes to,
In this style, 1s.
“Yours faithfully,
381teb{H314333i.
*P.S.. I perceive that a few crass attornies have called a meeting ' to
counteract the operation’ of my ‘New Insolvent Act,’ as being “injurious’
to them. It is an odd coincidence, but at that very time the foxes in my
neighbourhood—as I understand—called a meeting ‘to counteract the
operation' of the watch-dogs, that in the most injurious manner protected
the fowls and geese.”

HORRORS OF WAR.—THE DRAMATISTS' PETITION.
We are informed that the following petition lies at the office of the
Dramatic Authors' Society for signature. It has already received very
many influential names. It is a sort of private remonstrance to Lord
ABERDEEN : nevertheless, we believe we are violating no confidence in
laying it before the world, and soliciting—which we do most earnestly—
the active sympathy and assistance of all whom it may concern :—
“My Lord,—Your petitioners have for some years exercised the pro-
fession, or handicraft, of dramatists. That is, they have continually and
anxiously watched the movements of our natural enemies, the French ;
with the patriotic determination of always making the most of them.
Hence, the French have never put forth anything that your petitioners
have not immediately done the best to take it. That your petitioners
have very frequently succeeded, is triumphantly shown by the playbills of
all the London theatres.
“Many of your petitioners are yearly subscribers to the foreign library
of Mons. DELApoRTE ; and they submit that having, in the full reliance of
peace, only recently paid their annual subscription, any hostility between
the two countries would tend to the complete forfeiture of all such money
paid for the early transmission of French dramas—such dramas being,
like grouse, of a most perishable description.
“Your petitioners, therefore, humbly pray that you will on no account
undertake a war against France; war always being, to most people,
attended with disastrous results; but, in the case of your petitioners, with
ruin most complete and final.
“Your petitioners earnestly entreat you to consider the forlornness of
their condition, in the event of war. They are incapable of any other
labour save that of translation, which (for many years) has afforded them
a decent subsistence. Utterly unacquainted with the process by which a
plot is made—incapable of the least invention of character—and wholly at
a loss to find a language of their own to express themselves, they put it
to your Lordship's generous consideration to imagine their destitution
in the event of such a catastrophe as a war with France. All other wars
are, perhaps, allowable; especially Indian and Chinese wars, they being

very dramatic in their character, and affording the finest opportunity for
entirely new scenery, dresses, and decorations.
“Your petitioners further state it as their belief, that several of their
distinguished body are at this moment in Paris, in the delightful and
praiseworthy pursuit of knowledge at the various metropolitan theatres;
and your petitioners therefore trust—in case of the worst—that Loan
CowLEY will be instructed to demand passports for their brethren; or, if
that be impossible, to cause whatever “effects” they may have obtained
on the French stage, to be immediately transmitted to this country, for
the benefit of the fraternity in general.
“And further—if a war be inevitable, your petitioners trust that all the
effects of Frenchmen residing in England will be immediately seized and
confiscated for the compensation of the dramatists undersigned.
“And your petitioners will ever pray (prey).”

PRINCE ALBERT'S MILITARY STUDIES.
Rom Windsor we learn His Royal HighNEss
PRINCE ALBERT is taking daily lessons in soldier-
ing; so that, in the event of a war—should the
PRINCE DE Joinville land a lot of troops on the
English coast—PRINCE ALBERT will be ready at
the head of his regiment to drive them all back
again. We understand that the telescope, which
is usually carried in the hand of a Commander in
Chief during the action, has not evaded the keen
eye of PRINCE ALBERT, who has been practising
the telescope exercise four hours a day, with
the very natural idea that he will be able to
do more good by looking on at a distance, than
by exposing himself to immediate danger on the
actual field of battle. His Royal Highness has also been devoting much
time to acquiring the exact tone of voice in which the Duke of Wei-
LINgton uttered his celebrated exclamation “Up guards, and at 'em "
which is said to have been one of the causes of winning the battle of
Waterloo. If a victory can be gained by such means as these, we have
every hope that PRINCE ALBERT will twine the laurel of Fame round the
peaceful jupp of his every-day costume.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 117
SHAMEFUL CASE OF LETTER OPENING.
A TALE OF THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE.
We have received from a member of that absurd place of meeting
the two following letters, which we print at his request:—
SIR, August 16, 1844.
You will see by the stamp on the paper, that I am a member of
a club which shall be nameless—but spose its in George Street, Anover
Square.
q I ave friends, lovers of litteryture and members of that club.
HALDERMAN Codshead is a lover of litteryture and member of that clubb ;
MR. X-SHERIFF SPETTIGUE is a ditto ditto —and hah what tremlous
ixitement and dalicious hinflux of joy I ave ad, when SELINA SPETTIGEw,
in her kinary bonnit and pink muzzlin dress, attended our president's last
lecture on Jericho | I was introdewst to her by the sheriff that day. It
was but the fommation of a wild inheffable tremenduous passion on
my part.
I'm not the honly member of our club of the name of Jones, has you
well know. I'm not only not the only Jones, but I’m not the only
SAMUEL Jones—there's another S. J. (ang him, or if you will allow the
stronger word, pray don't bawk yourself) there's another SAMUEL, the
capting, late of the Oxillary Legium, a great feller of near six foot high,
with emence beard and mistaches, who always smoax his filthy sigars, and
swells and swaggers hup and down the club-room as hif it was his own.
Heven when Buckinham comes in, this great beast don't stir hisself or
take hoff his at. You may then fansy what a rood monster he is. They
say he killed two gents in jewels in Spain: and though he's perpetuly
hectaring over me, of course I ain't a going to run the risk of gitten
myself anged for the pleasure of shootin' him. Besides I never fired a
pistol hoff in my life—but to my porpoise.
You must know this beest is always º my letters. He's at the
Hinstitute from morning till night, and has I can only stepp in of an
evening when my estabblishment (Swan and EDGAR's) is closed—of coarse
he has the pick and chews of the letters that come in. And I have my
letters directed there as well as he has. It's more fashnable.
In this way the blaggerd has red many scoars of my letters—those from
my Ma and Sisters—those from my Aunt Cowdy in Liverpool—from all
my friends in fact: for his curosity is perfectly insashable. But once
when I opened one of his letters by mistake, the great broot snapt his
fingers close to my nose, and swoar he'd pull it if he ever found me
meddling with his corspondance again! The consquance now is, that I ani
halways ableeged to wait now until he has º both our sets of letters,
before I venter to look at mine. So that I hoſt’n say (in bitterness of
sperrit) “there's two on 'em at my letters, SAM Jones and SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM.”
Well ! When I say I made a favorable impression on the art of SELINA
SPETTIGEw, on the night of that Lectur on Jericho—I bleave I may say so
without fear of going wrong.
Old Sperrigew, who had been asleep during the lecter with his
bandanner over his face, woak up where BuckixhAM came to a stop, and
said to me, -
“You’ve taken care of my SELINA, MR. Jones.”
“Sir,” says I, “I ave,” and SELINA's is and mine met; and we blushed,
my, how we did blush :
“I’ll tell you what, Jones, my boy,” says he, (he knows my fammaly.)
* I'm blest if I don't ask you to dinner.” My art beat an hunderd a
minute; I went and called a cab, and put the dear ladies in for Hunter
Street, their fammaly manshan, and SPETTY and I ad some supper at the
Hinstatute, which I stood—the appiest of human beings
- - +
Days roaled on—SPETTY never asked me to dinner—I pined and pined
as I thought of SELINA. I did’nt call in Unter Street. Pride pravented
me: and bisness hours isn't over till eight. I saw SPETTY at the lectur
on the tomb of Cheops' grandmother (dalivered by Mr. B.), but he
evoided me. I was too prowd to notice him—I am not poor—I am not
an adventurer seaking for faviours. My father is an aberdasher in the
west of Hengland, I am in London honly for my heducation.
Fansy then my disgust one day at hearing that other SAM Jones—
confound him—a standin' among a score of other chaps, roaring with
lafter, and making no end of fun—and imagin my luxry at overearing
him say—
“You know that little beast my namesake who comes to this infernal
hole. He's a haberdasher's apprentice. I open all his letters by mistake
—and have read every word about his mama, and his sisters, and his aunt
Cowdy. Well sir, six weeks ago, old SPETTIgue was here with his
daughter at Buck's lecture. The gal's a monstrous fine gal. I heard
SPET say he would ask the little brute to dinner. I got his invitation ;
answered it, and by Jove, sir, I went. Real turtle—and plenty of port
after dinner.”
Hearing this I was halmost busting with indignation. So I goes up to
the other SAMUEL Jones and I says, “Sir,” says I, “your umble servant.”
At this sarchasm the beest bust out laughing again—and all the other
ſellers as well—and has for me—I, sir, can bear it no longer.
*
Ham I to be robbed, my letters to be opened, to be bullied, laughed at,
in this dastardly way? No sir, as you have taken the affares of the
Hinstitute in hand–I imploar you pint out the shameful impydince
practised upon
Your constant reader,
SAMUEL Jones.
SIR, B. & F. I. August 18, 1844.
It 's too late now. You needn't put in that fust letter I wrote.
It's no good : no balls in to a broken art. Send me a straight waste-coat,

for I'm dizzystracted. I’ve jest read in the Morning Post the
following:—
“Married at St. Pancras, by the Rev. Dr. Golightly, SAMUEL Jones, Esq.,
K.S.F., K.S.T., M.B. & F.I., late a Lieutenant in the service of her Most Catholic
| Majesty, to SELINA Scramjaw, only daughter of Mortimsa SpsTrigus, Esq. or
Hunter Street, Brunswick Square.”
It's his reading my letters that has done it. This is the consequence
of the spy system. -
No more from your unappy
SAMUEL Jones.
THE KENSINGTON RAILWAY.
A PASSENGER AT LAST |
An omnibus suddenly drew up at the Kensington and Wormwood
Scrubbs Little Western and No Junction Railway, at 35 m. p. 7, on
Saturday evening last : the sensation created was immense. On the roof
was observed a gentleman with a brown paper parcel ; the One Porter, in
stupified amazement rushed to the omnibus—the Gentleman threw down
his luggage, and scrambling down, demanded, in a trembling voice, if the
“train was gone.” Bewildered by the strange question, the porter could
not answer, but, taking violently to his heels, ran over the way to fetch
the Clerk. Five minutes afterwards, a person in shirt sleeves, emerged
from the public-house opposite, and, with a curl on his lip, told the
Gentleman “he was the Clerk.” The Gentleman gave a convulsive twitch
to his brown paper parcel, and mildly replied “he wished to go to Bath.”
A cry was immediately raised of “Where's the Stoker?” and a pot-boy
out of place, having volunteered as the Guard, was, after a consultation
of five minutes between the Clerk and the till, despatched to Hammer-
smith for a half hundred-weight of coals. The steam, however, was got
up in less than forty minutes, and, at about 4 p. 8, the Special train
started, with its one passenger, for Bath. In the evening the office was
lighted up with gas, and the Clerk invited the Conductor and Cad of the
Omnibus to an elegant souper of Welsh rabbits and cheroots, in com-
memoration of this event. The beer was of the best XXX.

Sir James gave the word in a fine sonorous voice ; and was admirably responded to. Nothing could
be more dexterous than the manner in which the postmen, by means of lucifer and wax, resealed the various missives. When wafers were to be
used, the word of command was thus:–
* Wet waſer I
“Insert waſer I
“Stamp 1"
The review over, Sir JAMEs emphatically complimented the body on their efficiency; and they were then dismissed for their several walks.
BEAUTIES OF THE POLICE COURT.
One Christopher PRATT was charged at the Thames Police Office with
an assault. Having made his way into the kitchen of the Camden's Head,
Limehouse, he committed felony on a leg of lamb, by eating thereof.
Kerrle, the pot-boy, remonstrated with the thief, when–
“. He seized the boy by the neck and drew the knife which he had used in cutting the
lamb several times across the lad's throat, at the same time uttering the most dreadful
imprecations, mixed with awful threats, that if Kettle ever uttered a word about the
iamb, he'd certainly do for him. In drawing the knife across his throat Pratt inflicted
two slight wounds in the lad's throat.”
Subsequently, the boy informed his master, when Pratt learning this—
“Tapped him [Kettle] on the shoulder and said, 'So, you have taken ºut a warrant
against me?" Kerrle admitted that he had, upon which Pratt struck him a violent
blow upon the stomach, which at the same time felled and doubled him up, so as nearly
to deprive him of all sensation. Exhausted as he was, he, however, remembered that
Paart first jumped with his whole weight upon his body, then knelt upon his chest,
and seizing him violently by the throat, endeavoured to strangle him.”
The boy, it is said, from extreme pain and debility gave his evidence
with considerable difficulty.
And what was the punishment of this would-be cut-throat—this das-
tardly thief and ruffian
Why, the majesty of the offended law fined him in the sum of four
pounds, which, as he could not pay,+as he had not the wherewithal to
buy the luxury of cutting a throat, he was ignominiously consigned to
the van, to be imprisoned for—one month !
Had he been indicted for stealing the meat his imprisonment might
have been three times that duration.
Memorandum: a boy's throat is of less value than a leg of lamb.
Inhuman Reprisals.
If the French madly rush into a war, the severest measures of ven-
ance will be taken by this Government. Every prisoner will be com-
lled to enter into the British and Foreign Destitute—with continual
tures on Jericho by MR. BucKINGHAM I
REAL SCALPS 1 GREAT ATTRACTION.
MR. Carlin, the importer of foreign curiosities for the English nation
lately advertised a most attractive dish. The Ioway Indians—he assured
a refined, a humane, and discerning public—would dance the Scalp Dance
with-real scalps Think of that, ladies and gentlemen; the real skin
and hair of a human creature. Is not that attractive As for the
loways themselves, why by this time they are a common cold dish—but
the scalp supplies the delicious pickles to the feast.
Still, we think the entertainment might be heightened. Scalping is,
ordinarily, a fatal operation: nevertheless, men have been known to
survive it. Why not then—for a crowning treat—why not engage a few
desperate wretches, as the managers say, at an enormous expense, to
submit to scalping—making it worth their while to risk life –and of
cºurse doubling the price of admission to the tasteful and curious public
We really think the experiment would answer; at all events, it would
º tº carrying out the delicate feeling which advertised the—“real
caps:
We are happy to learn that Mr. Carlin has engaged a party of Hot-
tentots who will succeed the Ioways. After the real scalps, we presume
they will be girdled with sheep's intestines, and everything natural.
Where, alas! will the romance of life hide itself? We look in Cooper's
novels upon glorious pictures of the majestic wild man—the proud, the
indomitable, the disinterested—and he comes among us, and, with a torrent
of native eloquence, begs for sixpences !
The Plattest Contradiction,
. The Times announces that it is now certain that Louis Philirrº
is not coming over this year to England. We knew he never intended
it, directly it was published that M. MonTAliver had drawn from the
Liste Civile, for the expenses of the journey, a sum of 3,000,000 francs;
especially as it was reported the money had been paid over to His
Majesty.

PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER xxi.
From A poor relation.
_2~ *
MY DEAR Cousin,
Although so many years have passed
since we last met—nay, since we last corres-
ponded—I feel that I should do much wrong to
the goodness of your heart, to the truth and
dignity of our early friendship, did I fail to write to you in my pre-
sent strait. Did I listen to the sarcasms of the worldly and unge-
nerous, I should suffer in silence—but my soul revolts from their
harsh, cold creed, that confounds prosperity with selfishness, and
makes a golden barrier between kin and kin. I fear it may be too
true that a profitable commerce with the world is apt to change
some men—but there are others whose lustre of soul nothing can
dim. Let them possess the diamonds of Golconda, and their minds
would remain to them priceless and unchangeable.
Though there has been silence between us, it has often delighted
me to learn in this obscure nook that you were still increasing in
worldly goods and in the respect of all men. I have sent you no line,
yet have I spiritually again and again congratulated you on the
happiness that a wise enjoyment of wealth bestows—on the enviable
power of doing good to all around you. For I remembered the
candour and generosity of your soul, and knew that riches would be
only acceptable to you as bestowing a power to assist your fellow-
creatures; that you would consider gold, not as the familiar of avarice,
but as the beneficent charm of a fairy, by which you might profit and
delight your species.
There are foolish, gossiping folks, whose pleasure it seems to be to
set friends against friends: people, whose happiness (at least it would
almost appear so) is to find or make a flaw in the best of hearts.
Had I listened to them, I should have believed that you were desirous
of forgetting all your poorer kindred; that you looked upon your good
fortune as giving you the best right to deny your own blood; that,
in a word, being rich, you were no longer of the family—that you had,
in fact, been altogether new made by PLutus and had no relation-
ship whatever with the Rob INses. But how base, how wicked would
it have been in me to believe in such a scandal
“He has never written to any of you,” these people would say—
“depend upon it, he looks upon you all as a disgrace—as blots upon
his finer fortune.” But I knew too well that every monent of your
time was occupied—that you had so many demands upon your hours
that folks living in the quiet of the country have no thought of.
“Again,” I’ve said, “if cousin doesn't write to us, you must remember
we never write to him.” To this they've answered, “that was a
different matter; for as you were the rich party, you ought to write
first.” A sort of argument, I must say, I never could see the reason
of; for suppose you a thousand times richer than you are, what
difference should that make Lord bless us 1 as if your poor father
and my dear mother—fond brother and sister as they were—would
ever have thought about their children standing on any ceremony
with one another
You will, I know, be sorry to hear that I have had a great loss—
for me, a very great one. The House of FLIMsy and STRAw stopped
payment last week, and the consequence is, that I am at the present
moment without a penny. Nevertheless, it isn’t so bad as it seems;
for they do say that the estate will pay some day ten shillings and
odd in the pound. But the worst of it is, I am not able from this
accident to meet two or three matters which are fast pressing upon
me; and therefore in my difficulty must beg your assistance. I
would not do so, were I not certain that it would even annoy you if
I were to apply to anybody else. I know your heart so well that you
would never forgive me for hesitating. It would—I am sure you
would feel it so—be an affront to you as a friend and a kinsman.
How delightful then is it, on a stroke of ill-fortune like the present,
to know that we have a relative—a flourishing, cordial soul—who
looks upon himself as the steward of Providence; who is too happy
to show his gratitude for prosperity, by shaking some few crumbs from
his sumptuous, loaded board to his poor relations: who acknowledges
the solemn claims of blood, not alone with lip-acknowledgment,
but with a sympathy that elevates “him that gives and him that
takes.”
I will by the next post send you all particulars.
Your affectionate Cousin,
Edwan D. Ronixs.
LETTER XXII.
The answer.
DEAR Cous IN,
You are quite right. Although so many years have gone
by since you have written, you, nevertheless, only pay me my due,
when you believe that I am by no means forgetful of my father's
relations. As for the sarcasms and ill-words of people, I have too
much faith in my own motives to attend to them. You will always
find idle—too often, disreputable—persons who make the high and
the wealthy their licensed game. It is enough to be rich, to be
abused by them. Philosophy, however, and my bank-book, have
taught me to despise them. Not that I am a jot altered from the
time when we were intimate; certainly not—nevertheless, the
prejudices of the world require a certain dignity of appearance that
the vulgar mistake for pride and ostentation.
I am pleased to find that, though we have not corresponded, you
have, nevertheless, not forgotten me. I assure you, many a time,
worried and oppressed by the toil of a commercial life, I have, in
thought, visited your beautiful little house—(hal my dear friend, if
we only knew it, in such humility is true happiness I)—and have
wished that I could change all the glitter and ceremony of life for
the simple, yet substantial happiness of that homestead. You are
quite right in believing that I consider wealth as only an agent for
the ease and felicity of those about me—that is, if I really had the
wealth which the world, out of its ignorance or waywardness, is
pleased to credit me.
Forget my poorer kindred Impossible No man, who, by the
superiority of his talents and the energy of his character made an
advance in the world, was ever yet permitted to forget them. They
take too good care of that. It is true, my dear friend, that you
and I have not corresponded ; but you little know, how frequently,
and how very peculiarly, I have been made to remember the exist-
ence of the Robinses. As for being new-made by Plutus, I am
sure they have believed in such a re-creation, for they have again
and again addressed me as one lump of gold—again and again would
have been happy to change me among them.
They who have maligned me by urging that I considered the
poverty of my relations as a disgrace, know little of my true judg-
ment. I have, it is true, been compelled to look upon it as a great
misfortune, inasmuch, as I have too frequently felt its influence.
Your allusion to my father and your mother touches me—takes me
back again to the days of my youth—when I thought the world was
all that we read of in fairy books. Ha! my dear cousin, that was,
indeed, a time ! Pity is it that so sweet a dream should give way
to so hard and cold a reality.
Your news about FLIMsy and STRAw affects me deeply. I would
have wished to keep the ill-tidings from you, but the truth is, I fear
that I shall be seriously compromised by their failure. Very seriously,
indeed. I have been engaged in a mining speculation, in which-
but I will not distress you with what I fear may be the result. Not
that I have to dread anything fatal—certainly not ; nevertheless, I
fear—indeed, I am sure, that I shall be so driven into a corner that
my heart will not be allowed to act as it could wish ; and therefore
—but you must take courage, my dear friend, and not suffer yourself
to be dismayed by what may end in, comparatively, a trifle.
I know you think me rich—very rich. Well, I am not ungrateful.
Notwithstanding,a man may be CRuesus himself, yet not have a shilling
in his pocket. #. may appear strange to you; but nevertheless, men

PUNCH'S CHARGE TO JURIES.
GENTLEMEN of THE JURY, -
You are sworn in all cases to decide according to the evidence ;
at the same time, if you have any doubt, you are bound to give the
prisoner the benefit of it. Suppose you have to pronounce on the guilt
or innocence of a gentleman accused of felony. You will naturally
doubt whether any gentleman would commit such offences; accordingly,
however strong may be the testimony against him, you will, perhaps,
acquit him. The evidence of your own senses is, at least, as credible
as that of the witnesses; if, therefore, your eyesight convinces you
that the prisoner is a well-dressed person, you have a right to presume
his respectability ; and it is for you to say whether a respectable
person would be likely to be guilty of the crimes imputed to him.
In like manner, when you see a shabby-looking fellow in the dock,
charged, for example, with sheep stealing, the decision rests with
you, first, whether or not that individual is a ragamuffin, and,
secondly, how far it is probable that a man of that description would
steal sheep. Of course, as has been before said, you will always be guided
by the evidence; but then, whether the evidence is trustworthy or not is
a matter for your private consideration. You may believe it if you
choose, or you may disbelieve it; and whether, gentlemen of the jury, you
will believe it or disbelieve it, will depend on the constitution of your minds.
If your minds are so constituted that you wish to find the prisoner guilty,
perhaps you will believe it ; if they happen to be so constituted that you
desire to find him not guilty, why then, very likely, you will disbelieve
it. You are to free your minds from all passion and prejudice, if you
can, and, in that case, your judgment will be unbiassed ; but if you
cannot, you will return a verdict accordingly. It is not, strictly
speaking, for you to consider what will be the effect of your verdict; but
if such a consideration should occur to you, and you cannot help attending
to it, that verdict will be influenced by it to a certain extent. You
are probably aware, that when you retire, you will be locked up till
you contrive to agree. You may arrive at unanimity by fair discussion,
or by some of you starving out the others, or by tossing up ; and your
conclusion, by whichever of these processes arrived at, will be more or
less in accordance with your oaths. Your verdict may be right ; it is to
be hoped it will ; it may be wrong; it is to be hoped it will not. At all
events, gentlemen of the jury, you will come to some conclusion or other;
unless it should so happen that you separate without coming to any.
EYES AND EYELASHES.
SAD complaints have been forwarded to our Office of the conduct of
Waggoners, Draymen and others, Drivers of Carts and other vehicles of
burden, in respect of their manner of carrying their whips. The whip is
borne by these individuals over the shoulder, with the thong dangling
down their backs. To this arrangement, abstractedly considered, there is
no objection; but the thong not only dangles, but also whisks about at its
own sweet will, flying constantly in the face of all propriety, and every
now and then into that of some unhappy passenger. It is made to describe
those mischievous gyrations by the slouching, careless gait of the bearer;
the irregularity of which, there is every reason to suppose, is in many
cases aggravated by beer. It is bad enough when a natural lash gets into
the eye; what must it be to receive that of a whip there Policemen

get a guinea a day out of every prisoner: now, the money goes to
creditors. Believes that all the world will be insolvent, with nobody
to arrest 'em, if the Act isn't repealed. Has lost by it—for he is a
conscientious man, and has calculated every penny—£6000. 17s. Gºd.

THE WRONGS OF BARTHOLOMEW FAIR.
UNch might propound many deep specula-
tions to account for the decay of this
time-honoured festival, which BEN Jon-
son has immortalized—and at which the
LADY CAst LEMAINEs were wont to at-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IN AU G.U. R. ATION OF THE P UN CHI STATUE.
UNCH is proud to announce, that
though he has been expelled from
France, an honour far more than com-
pensating for that indignity has been
conferred on him by moral and intel-
lectual Germany. That noble country,
in testimony of its appreciation of his
public conduct, has caused a statue of
him to be executed by the celebrated
artist ADolph Fleisch MANN ; and
the statue has been sent over to Mr.
Punch, with a request that it should be
erected in some conspicuous situation
in London. It has been accordingly
erected in his office win-
dow, and the inauguration
took place last week, in the
presence of a large crowd
of spectators, who were
casually looking in. The
ceremony was performed
by the Publisher and Boy
Dick; and consisted in the
latter's moving some num-
bers of the periodical out
of the way, and the for-
mer's placing the figure in
the vacant space; after
which our Boy replaced his
hands in his pockets, and our
Publisher retired up the office,
amid the acclamations of the
lookers-on.
It was at first intended to
have placed the Punch Statue
on the top of a column of
“Punch ;” but as this proceed-
ing would have been less prac-
ticable than appropriate, the
intention was abandoned.
This wonderful work of art is
an admirable likeness, conceived
in the sculptor's happiest mo-
ment, and embodying the
happiest expression of the
original. By means of a
spring concealed in the
hunch, the features may be
set in motion at pleasure,
so as to produce those pe-
culiar movements which
it is Punch's greatest de-
light to excite in those of
his readers.

GENUINE REPORT OF THE PRINCE DE
JOINVILLE.
he delay attending the publication of the
report of the Paince DE Joinville created
considerable surprise, and even now the re-
port which has been given to the public is
not exact. The following are the precise
terms in which the PRINce DE Joinville
furnished his account of the bombarding of
Tangier. The report was addressed to the
KING, and not to the Minister of Marine,
though in its revised form it is given to
the world as a communication to that
functionary.
On board the Pluto Steamboat,
MY DEAR FATHER, August 10, 1844.
Knowing that you will be anxious to hear what I have
really done out here, I send you the particulars, which you can dish
up in any way you like as a report to MAckau, to whom I don't
think it worth while to write at all upon the subject.
On the 6th of August, being very anxious to distinguish myself in
a naval engagement, we let off some guns at the batterios. I
cannot tell the number of the enemy because we never saw them,
but I have no doubt that there were at least fifty times as many as
there were of us. Our brave sailors fired away beautifully, and we
only lost three men, who, I think, were killed by some of our own
shots; but it would read better in a Despatch, to attribute the fact to
the spirited resistance of the enemy. After having ceased our own
firing, we heard none from any other quarter; so I sent some of
our gallant fellows on shore, who saw that the batteries were all
destroyed, and the enemy retired from them. Not exactly knowing
where the enemy might be, I contented myself with the destruction
of the batteries instead of going into the town, where I thought the
enemy might have been waiting to retaliate, and thus have brought
down upon themselves further punishment. I dare say a good many
of the foe were killed. It is utterly impossible to count, because we
have nothing to guide us in our calculation; but it might be 150
killed, and 400 wounded. It is true, it might be half the number—
or it might not be one quarter;-but I think, as there is nobody to
set us right if we are wrong, it would be as well to make it the
number I have fixed upon. I have no doubt the English will be
greatly humbled, if this affair is worked in our Paris newspapers as
it ought to be. If I could bombard Tangier, why should I not do
the same with Dover? The only difference is, that one is in Morocco,
and the other in England. -
I'm in a great hurry to go to Mogador, where I believe the enemy
are not, for Bugeaud has gone to meet them somewhere else. I
shall knock Mogador about as much as I can without going too near,
and I think a very good report to the Minister of Marine may be
made up.
Your affectionate son,
Joinville.
THE NAME OF A PRINCE.
Our contemporary the Court Journal lately put forth a very beautifully
written article on the probable name of the last new Prince. The rake of
recollection had been poetically plunged into the garden of history, or, to
drop all metaphor, the writer had hooked up one or two leading events
in Hume and SMollert, upon which he had hung the glorious conclusion
that the public would be Electrified if the Prince were to be called
ALFRED. Now if electrifying the public is to be the grand object in
selecting a name for a Prince, we should suggest that the public would
be much less electrified by his being called ALFRED, than if he were to be
christened EbenezER SAMUEL JAMEs Timothy BENJAMIN. Such a name
as that would be what might be termed, figuratively—a stunner, to the
entire nation.

HOW TO LIVE ON NINE SHILLINGS A WEEK.
very man's income is limited more or less ; and he
must limit his expenditure accordingly. Thus, he may
be forced to content himself with a house of a rent not
exceeding two thousand a year, with no greater number
of servants than a dozen, with six horses and no more ;
with but two carriages; with turtle, venison, cham-
pagne, and burgundy, only now and then ; with a
middling box at the opera, and so on.
Nine shillings a week is a decidedly limited income. To live upon it a
man must first cut down his expenditure to the fewest possible branches,
and secondly apply the closest shaving to each. They can, hardly be
reduced below }. : food, clothes, and º ; but if anybody could do
without one of these, the difficulty would be much simplified. As to
lodging. The cheapest to be had must be chosen : the more unpleasant
the situation the better, as the rent will then be more reasonable. A road-
side hovel, or a ruinous old house up a court, may be recommended. A
single room, however small, must suffice for a whole family, however
large. Chairs, tables, bedsteads, and other moveables, may be dispensed
with ; the entire furniture should consist of a few blankets, and some
straw; and the blankets ought to be begged. Coals and candles are too
expensive ; and it is extravagant to have any fire at all, except to cook a
few potatoes, or to avoid being frozen to death.
With regard to clothes. These must be obtained, if possible, through
charity: there is another way of getting them, which it would be hardly
right to hint at. By a proper economy they may be made to last till they
fall to pieces, which they will not altogether do for years. If it is neces-
sary to buy clothes, they must be bought ; but the purchase should only
include indispensables. Shirts and stockings are superfluities; and the
younger children may always, and the whole family at times, manage to
do without shoes. Food must be confined, in general, to bread and
potatoes; but perhaps, with management, a little bacon may be indulged
in now and then. It will be out of the question to think of any other
drink than the plain water; and tea and sugar are luxuries not to be
dreamt of.
By following the above rules it is perhaps possible to live honestly on
nine shillings a week, with a wife and family. Medical attendance is out
of the question. What are called comforts must be considered unattain-
able ; for any man, even though starving and perishing, to help himself to
a meal, a handful of wood, or anything of the kind, is highly immoral ;
the law respects not persons but property, and severely visits such
wickedness.
Qſìt #int àrts in ſtantt.
We understand that it is at length decided what are to be the subjects
cf the two pictures for which vacancies have been left on the walls of the
French Chamber of Deputies. The first will be a magnificent and highly
imaginative representation of the PRINCE DE Joinville in the Belle Poule,
towing the town and castle of Dover into Boulogne harbour; while the
second will exhibit the same hero storming Windsor Castle, and receiving
the keys of the Round Tower from the five military knights who had been
defending it.
SHAKSPERE AT SADLER’S WELLS.
It is a fact not so generally known as it ought to be, that when the
Shaksperian monopoly was destroyed by Act of Parliament, several
of the ancient members of the profession—the champions of the good
old times—went into deep mourning for the death of the legitimate
drama. Two or three took to their beds, had their knockers tied
up, and straw laid before their doors. CHARLEs KEMBLE made a
manful fight for it; and, as a last piece of devotion to the moribund
Shakspear, read him “a little compressed.” MR. BuNN took
refuge from his sorrows in the blandishments and endearments of
ballet and opera, and at length consented to be comforted. Now,
Mrs. WARNER and MR. PHElps did better than all ; for, full of
hope, they took Sadler's Wells Theatre, and, to the edification and
amusement of thronging audiences, have for weeks past been playing
Shaxspeak, BEAuMont and FLEtchER, SHEniDAN, and such
folks, who—it was sorrowingly predicted—had been destroyed for
ever and for ever by a recent statute It is not often that Punch
visits a theatre. Sooth to say, he has had but few temptations; but he
has been to Sadler's Wells of late, and has seen plays so excellently
put upon the stage—has beheld an audience so possessed and delighted
by the admirable acting of the scene,—that he would be false to
himself and to the town (whose guide, philosopher, and friend he is),
not to counsel the said town—or those members of it who delight in
the glories of a good play well acted—to make a ºft. towards
merry Islington, made all the merrier by the high entertainment
now proffered to all comers. Assuredly it is a pleasant reproof to
those despairing folks who sighed over the hopeless condition of
the Drama, to witness its robust vitality at Sadler's Wells. Shak-
sPERE may have been banished from Drury Lane and Covent Garden;
but then he has found the snuggest asylum near the New River.
There, at nights, is he heard in all the might of his passion and the
tenderness of his thoughts, and there, in sweetest, laziest mood, is
he sometimes to be seen, fishing for what Chan LEs LAxis called

Accident to the Liberator.
When all the preparations were made to liberate O'Connell, it was
discovered to be impossible for the martyr to quit the prison by the same
door that he entered it. The truth is, he had become so enormously fat,
in consequence of the culinary presents of a grateful people, that another
opening had to be made in the walls before he could wend his way to
Merrion-square. This circumstance is not generally known ; but those
who recollect—and who does not t—our portrait of O'Connell in his
captivity, cannot for a moment doubt it.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
-CHAPTER THE TENTH.-OF THE TITLE TO REAL PROPERTY
IN GENERAL.
ITLE is defined by SIR Edward Coke to be
titulus, a definition in which the Latin
dictionary curiously coincides with the very
* astute old jurist. A title is the means by
which a man hath the just possession of his
property, and there must be several requi-
sites to form a title to land, which differs in
this respect from a title to nobility, which
is often conferred on those who have none
of the natural requisites of nobility.
The lowest degree of title is naked posses-
sion, which is such a title as a man has who
is bathing in the Serpentine; but his naked possession may be put an
end to by his being ordered out of the water when the term for bathing
has expired.
The next step is the right of possession, which arises when a man has
booked a phace in the boxes of a theatre, but is kept out by some one who
has the wrongful possession. Here the rightful possessor is disseised
until the intruder, who has the actual possession, is seized and turned out
by the box-keeper. The right of possession may however, be lost by
negligence, as when the actual possessor is allowed to sit without being
disturbed by him who has the right of possession until after the end of the
first act, beyond which period no places can be kept, although they may
have been taken.
There may, however, be a right of property without even a right of
possession, which is equivalent to the law saying, “such a thing ought to
be yours, but nevertheless you shall not have it.” This occurs when a
disseisor, the genteel legal name for a man who takes what don't belong
to him, happens to die, then the son of the disseisor has a right to the
possession, and the owner has a right to the property—if he can get hold
of it. This is called a mere right, which is in many cases a mere humbug.
A complete title to lands therefore requires a right of possession joined
with a right of property; but the crafty Fleta, perceiving that people did
not always get their property even when they had this jus duplicatum or
double right—the two affirmatives sometimes resulting in a practical
negative—the knowing Fleta laid it down that possession was also neces-
sary in order to constitute a good legal title. It follows, then, the law
gives you a title to what is your own :-lst, if you have a right to it ; and
2nd, if you have actually got hold of it, when if you can manage to keep
it, you will have the full privilege of doing so. Such are the incidents of
a title to real property in general, which means that the law generally
surrounds all property with the little difficulties alluded to.

FRIENDLY ADVICE TO A POLICEMAN.
Young Officer,
Always come when you are called ; this is a rule too much
neglected by some of you. Do your duty; England expects that of every
man; but she does not expect you to do more. Bid the apple-woman,
if obstructive, to move on ; but go not out of your way to get into hers.
Keep a sharp look-out for rogues and vagabonds ; but apprehend not
every poor-looking person you see, for a beggar. Smite; but smite for-
bearingly the young leaper of the street-post : cuff, but cuff not with
cruelty. Remember that the mice will disport themselves in the absence
of Grimalkin ; that the pickpocket is on the alert when the Policeman's
back is turned, and suffer not the siren voice of Susan at the area to
beguilo you from the beat of vigilance.
our deportment should inspire respect, not excite ridicule. Strive,
therefore, to know what to do with your hands at times when the collar
of the evil-doer may not require their agency. Avoid the semi-military
f. walk perfectly, but not bolt upright. Above all things, when you
appen to be on horseback, never allow your head to be turned by your
unifornia.
Young Officer, whoever you are, A., or Z., accept these gentle hints
from one who ranks among the chief friends of that Peace of which you
are constituted the guardians; namely,
Punch.

and Louis-PhILIPPE. Her ladyship wished to
know if war was likely, and like a true woman
applied at once to head quarters. We have been
exclusively favoured with a copy of the cor-
respondence, which we subjoin :-
LADY ALDBOROUGH TO LOUIS-PHILIPPE.
SiRE,--I have just returned home from my morning drive, and having
seen “Mort aux Anglais" chalked on walls and other places—besides
having remarked many significant gestures on the part of your excellent
people—I am desirous to learn of your courtesy, when you think the war
between England, and France will really commence. It would much
'oblige me could I have the earliest notice, as I have much packing.
Your obedient servant,
.P.S. In the event of a war, I wish particularly to know if my poodle
will be suffered to depart with me, or if he will be claimed as a French-
born subject 1
LOUIS-PHILIPPE TO LADY ALDBOROUGH.
MY DEAR Lady Aldborough,
It penetrates me with the greatest distress to learn your uneasi-
ness. Assure yourself, my dear madam ; assure yourself. As for the
words “Death to the English,” they mean nothing. They merely indicate
the literary yearnings of my people. They must always be writing some-
thing; and it is one of their characteristics to choose death and such
horrors; they being, as they conceive, peculiarly national. As for the chalk,
I assure you, odd as it may seem, it is that very article that will prevent
any rupture between England and France. We can't afford it; we must
fight upon credit—and then how is the chalk to be wiped off—how is the
score to be paid afterwards :
Resides, is it likely that we should be going to war, when I have just
sent a char-à-lanc-a sort of French omnibus—to my sweet little friend,
QUEEN Victoria It is one of the largest kind, not only capable of
accommodating Her MAJesty, the PRINCE, and the children ; but all the
philosophers, authors, artists, and men of science, who, as I understand,
are continually guests at Windsor.
Trust me, my dear Madam, we shall have no war: no, you are in Paris
safe-safe as though you were in Eden.
Yours,
Louis-Philippr.

THE COMEDY
OLP birds are not to be caught with chaff; or certainly not with
the chaff of Irish law, as administered in the case of RegiNA v.
O'Connell. In vain has SIR Rob ERT tried to put the fatal salt on
the tail of the Liberator. He has flown away upon “the wings of a
dove;” but whether he will be at rest, even Punch himself cannot
prognosticate. That the sporting delights of September were ex-
pressly invented for the solace and relaxation of law-makers, no one
save the forlornest sceptic can deny. Never, then, were these plea-
sures so necessary to a Ministry as on the closing of the session 1844.
They must have retired from the House of Commons with feelings
very much akin to those of an actor, who—although he had made a
few tolerable hits in the course of his part, and was vehemently
applauded therefore by his good friends with orders—was, neverthe-
less, soundly hissed at the fall of the curtain. O'Conn ELL is now a

incarnation of all the wisdom, the force, and the purity of human

Robinson's Magazine.—Robinson, this month, presents a good bill of
fare ; though some of the dishes want a little seasoning. “Quiddlethorp”
increases in interest; but a spice of ginger in the hero, and a little more
pepper and salt in his tiger, young Fipp, would be an improvement. The
scene in Wapping is deficient in gas ; and the Police Office sketch wants
indigo. We admire the junk in “Larboard Jack ;” but must enter our pro-
test against the bilgewater. Had the author kept more to the gangway, and
steered clearer of the main-brace, the tale would have told more effectively.
The Cheshire in the “Demon Sire” may please some palates; but we
should have preferred Stilton. We laughed heartily over “Alderman
Bobwig.” The narrative, it is true, is rather fruity, but in many parts
of it we recognise the true bee's-wing. On the whole, and making allow-
ance for some little excess of sawdust, and an occasional unnecessary
introduction of bran, the current Robinson is an improvement on its
predecessors.

PUNCII,
OR TIIE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THOM, THE WEAVER POET OF
THE Scotch press is even at this time hardly silent on that great
national ceremony—mingling of triumph with self-humiliation—
the Burns Festival. Scotland, however, is repentant Scotland, and
will sin no more. Let us test her sincerity. Let us try the honesty of
her sighs and groans at the Banks of the Doon, by the activity of her
sympathies at Inverury. Let us, if we can, discover the real annount
of her affection for the dead Ploughman, by her tenderness towards
a kindred, if a lesser, spirit—the living Weaver. In fine, let us
see how Scotland—enthusiastic, genius-loving Scotland—stands
towards Rob ERT Bunns, deceased, and WILLIAM Thost, living and
suffering.
It is obvious that our limits compel us to be brief. Otherwise, we
would reprint the whole of Thom's story, written, as much of it is,
in the very tears of domestic anguish. We must confine ourselves
to brief extracts. WILLIAM Thom is a hand-loom weaver; he is a
native of Aberdeen, and was born in 1800. He lived with his family
at the village of Newtyle, when, some years since, he was left to
struggle on five shillings a week.
“I will not expatiate,” he says," on six human lives subsisting on five shillings weekl
—on babies prematurely thoughtful—on comely faces withering—on desponding yout
and too-quickly declining age.”
With no employment, he pawned “a most valuable relic of better
days” for ten shillings, with which he bought a few books to trade
with. He and his family then left their breadless home. They
travelled three days.
“Sunset was followed by cold, sour east winds and rain. The children becoming
weary and fretful, we made frequent inquiries of other forloru-looking beings whom we
met, to ascertain which farm-town in . vicinity was most likely to afford us quarters.
Jºan was sorely exhausted, bearing an infant constantly at her breast, and often carrying
the youngest boy also, who had fairly broken down in the course of the day.”
Thom, we should have premised, is a cripple. When seven years
old, his ankle and foot were crushed beneath the carriage of the
EARL of Earol, Lord Lieutenant of Aberdeenshire. No pleasant
thought this, to the Earl, we should imagine, when he heard—for as a
Scotchman, of course, he has heard—of the multiplied miseries of the
unassisted poet. But to proceed : Thom seeks shelter at a “comfort-
able-looking steading,” but is denied the hospitality of an out-house
and straw.
“I returned to my family. They had crept closer together, and all, except the mother,
were fast asleep. ‘Oh, Willie, Willie, what keepit ye?” Inquired the trembling woman:
* I'm dootſu'o' Jeanie,” she added : " isna she waesome like? Let’s in frae the cauld."
‘We’ve nae way to gang, lass,” said I, ‘whate'er come o' us... Yon folk winna hae us.”
Few more words passed. I drew her mantle over the wet and chilled sleepers, and sat
down beside them. My head throbbed with pain, and for a time became the tenement
of thoughts I would not now reveal. They partook less of sorrow than of indignation,
and it seemed to me that this same world was a thing very much to be hated; and, on
the whole, the sooner that one like me could get out of it, the better for its sake and
mine own. I felt myself, as it were, shut out from mankind-enclosed-prisoned in
misery—no outlook—none My miserable wife and little ones, who alone cared for me
—what would I not have done for their sakes at that hour ! Here let me speak out—
and be heard, too, while I tell it—that the worli does not at all times know how unsafely
it sits—when Despair has loosed Honour's last hold upon the heart—when transcendent
wretchedness lays weeping Reason in the dust—when every unsympathising on-looker is
deemed an enemy—who the N can limit the consequences? For my own part, I confess
that, ever since that dreadful night, I can never hear of an extraordinary criminal, with-
out the wish to pierce through the mere judicial view of his career, under which, I am
persuaded, there would o'ten be found to exist an unseen impulse-a chain, with one
end fixed in Nature's holiest ground, that drew him on to his destiny.”
He is no common man who writes thus. However, to finish this
terrible narrative. The wretched family obtain admittance about
INVERURY, VERSUS SCOTLAND.
eleven o'clock at the farm-house of John Coopen, West Town, of
Kinnaird, and were led to an out-house.
“In less than half-an-hour, the whole slept sweetly in their dark and almost roofless
dormitory. I think it must have been between three and four o'clock when JEAN
wakened me. Oh, that scream 1–I think I can hear it now. The other children, startled
from sleep, joined in ſrightful wail over their dead sister. Our poor JEAN is had,
unobserved by us, sunk during the night under the effects of the exposure of the
lº. evening, following, as it did, a long course of hardship, too great to be borne
y a young frame.”
The child is buried—the family wander on. One night they arrive
at a lodging-house at Methven. Thom is required to pay sixpence
for the accommodation; the rule of the house being payment before
the parties “tak'aff their shoon.” This demand induces Thom to
have recourse to his flute. He leaves the lodging with his wife –
“‘A quarter of an hour longer,” said I, ‘and it will be darker; let us walk out a bit.”
The sun had been down a good while, and the gloamin' was lovely. In spite of every-
thing, I felt a momentary reprieve. I dipped my dry flute in a little burn and began tº
play. It rang sweetly amongst the trees I moved on and on, still playing, and still
Jacing the town. “ The flowers of the forest' brought me before the house lately
mentioned. My music raised one window after another.”
His music touched the hearts and pockets of the Methven folk.
“There was enough to encourage farther perseverance; but I felt, after all, that I had
begun too late in life ever to acquire that “ease and grace' indispensable to bim who
would successfully “carry the gaberlunzie on.' I felt I must forego it, at least in a
downright street capacity.”
After a time, trade revived a little—he got tired of “this beggar's
work”—and settled at Inverury :—
“Nine months after our eettlement here '’ he says, “She died—JEAN, the mother of
my family, partner of my wanderings, the unmurmuring sharer in all my difficulties-
#. us, too, just as the last cloud was passing, ere the uutbreak of a brighter day. The
cloud º, but the warmth that followed lost half its value to me, she being no
partner therein.”
In 1841, Thom sent a poem, The Blind Boy's Pranks, signed “By a
Serf" to the Aberdeen Herald. The simple beauty of this poem
attracted the attention of MR. Gordon, of Knockespock, one of those
men of true heart who wait not until genius shall become church-
yard clay, ere they can feel for its past agonies. . This gentleman
became the fast friend of Thom, and has stood by him until the
present time. Thom is now at his loom at Inverury. “Alas! for
the loom though,” he says, “amid the giant waves of monopoly, the
solitary loom is fast sinking Thus must the lyre like a hen-coop be
thrown on the wrecking waters, to float its owner ashore . "
We have no space to quote any of Thom's poems. They possess
great natural grace and tenderness; though their dialect will prevent
their popularity on this side of the Tweed. For which good reason,
Thom more especially belongs to Scotland; it is the more her duty
to foster him.
Be it understood, that in the above we have made no discovery.
Two years ago the narrative was published in Scotland; nay, it
adorned the pages of Chambers' Journal—a work peculiarly addressed to
Scotch sympathies, and what has Scotland up to this time done for
Thom 1 Why, in the words of a correspondent, “Scotland, with but
few exceptions, has felt proud and sorry, and has given a return
of nil 1 *
But the time is not yet come. In some eight-and-forty years,
perhaps, there may be a Thom Festival. A descendant of Ennoi's
Earl—of the family whose carriage made a hopeless cripple of the
poet—may honour the solemnity with his presidentship; a Professor
—some Jupiter from the great Saturn—may discourse
“Like that large utterance of the early gods 1"–
and all be jubilee and gladness. Then may the weaver's house at
Newtyle bevisited—then may the roadside where the mother watched
her dying infant be deemed consecrated ground—the flute on which
the poet played for meals and shelter, a priceless relic Wait eight-
and forty years, William Thom, and such glory shall be your's.
For the present, starve. It is cheaper—thinks economic Scotland–
to give bays to the dead, than bread to the living.
it has been insinuated that—rirá roce—we called the Burns
Festival, a “hollow humbug.” We have no recollection that such a
phrase ever escaped us. If, however, Scotland continues to neglect
the weaver of Inverury, we shall no longer doubt the hollowness of
the late festival, as a national demonstration. Add every Scotch
coronet to that of Eglintoux—let Professon Wilson
“was that thunder?”
No : we can name Prof Esson Wilson, and the heavens still be
tranquil Let Professon Wilson, we say, utter the eloquence
of all Olympus, why, even then, with Tuom neglected, we would

most unhesitatingly pronounce the words attributed to us, and in the
very teeth of Scotland groan, “Hollow Humbug. 1"
But no, Scotland will do otherwise; she will be genial, generous
towards the weaver of Inverury. She will sympathise with his
wants, she will be proud of his genius. Yes, in the case of WILLIAM
Thom a miracle will be worked; for he will find that he “can gather
figs of Thistles.”
A word for ourselves. We have been pleasantly abused by Tait.
Very dirty motives have been made for our notice of the BURNs
Festival. Now the man who makes
dirty motives for others, generally
does so from an abundance of the
material in his own nature. The

“had visited too-favoured Scotland
at publishers’ expence.” Now, how
was it that this enthusiastic Scot
thought of an expence—in this case
certainly apocryphal, and never to

of his closet, trying to feather his
skewers for arrows that he might
shoot them at Punch. He heard
upon the stairs the chink of six-
pences and the rattle of bawbees; and then the pulseless genius of
Scottish thrift walked in to cast up for the enthusiast his expenses per
rail and back from Edinburgh to Ayr. It was thus he thought of
ours . A matter wholly of association of ideas. And then his genius,
thinking of Punch, cried out to him, in the words of Scrub in the

Monday. — PRINCE ALBERT's
shaving water started from the
kitchen boiler exactly at six, and
arrived at the royal landing-place,
where it was received by the Prince's
valet, at two minutes after. Her
Majesty, who always washes in cold,
M was ready some time before ; and
MAJon-GENERAL WEMYss, who is
a very bad getter-up, having been
waited for for a few minutes, the
royal cortège then started in three
| carriages and four for the railway
station.
MAJon-GENERAL WEMYss had to
be woke up on arriving at Slough ;
for the gallant officer had been at-
tempting to snatch forty winks, and
had succeeded in enjoying about
twenty, when a violent nudge from
Colon El Bouvenie reminded him
of the necessity for keeping his eyes
open. At Slough the royal party
were received by the porters and
policemen; the former wearing the
Knots of the Order of the Portman-
teau. The clerk in attendance having
made out two grown-up tickets for
the Queen and the Prince, and taken
half fare for the Princess Royal, de-
livered the checks to Visco UNT Ess
CANNING, who placed them in her
glove, and the whole party soon ar-
rived at Paddington. From thence
they proceeded over Vauxhall Bridge
to the Elephant and Castle, where
the Princess Royal was rather trou-
blesome, in consequence of a sudden
desire to stop and see the Elephant;
but her Royal Highness having been
pacified by an acidulated drop, the
royal party at length arrived at
Woolwich.
ARRIVAL AND EMBARKATION AT WOOLWICH.
Nine o’Clock.—Woolwich was in a state of immense excitement,
and the authorities at the Dockyard had tied bits of ribbon all about
the premises in celebration of the auspicious occasion. An immense
cannon, and a battery of twelve-pounders, having been placed under
Captain Bohe, the gallant Captain, with the battery of twelve-
pounders under him, sat down to wait the coming of the royal
visitors.
Precisely at nine o'clock two outriders plunged into the dockyard,
which was the signal for the discharge of the battery under Carrain
Bone, at which the horses of the outriders took fright, and Captain
Bohe entirely disappeared—nobody being in the least aware, what
became of him.
The little Princess was much pleased with the music of the band,
and called Prince Albert's attention to the fact that they were
playing “God save Mamma;” a tune with which her Royal Highness
has of course become by this time perfectly familiar.
The Queen looked remarkably well, and wore her second-best
black silk dress, with her new crape bonnet. Paince ALBERT wºre
his Oxford mixed wrapper over a suit of black, and he had got on his
drabhat, with a deep black band standing out in bold relief over the
rim of it. The PRINcess Royal wore a bonnet and ribbons, but as
her mamma's shawl was placed over her shoulders, it was impossible
to make out the remainder of the infantine apparel.

they did not arrive pretty punctually. Whether the conjugal joke
had anything to do with it, we, of course, cannot tell, but HER
MAJEsty, as the Obserrer informs us, “looked very pale, and went
below immediately.”
The current number of Punch, without which the QUEEN never
thinks of travelling, soon restored HER MAJEsty to her former self;
but Pai Nck ALBERT, seeing it begin to rain, and having already had
sufficient damp thrown upon him, crept for shelter into a small nook
“abaft the paddle-box.”
It was soon after this that the Lightning steamer was observed
approaching on her return from conveying PRINCE FREDERick to
Ostend, when HER MAJEsty being anxious to know how Prussia got
home, had the Lightning stopped to ask after him. It was then that
Lond ADolphus FitzcLARENcE came out with a touch of that
epigrammatic humour for which his Lordship, amongst his own im-
mediate circle, is peculiarly noted. He was engaged at the moment
in heaving the lead, and wrote on a card with the very lead he was
in the act of heaving, the following Epigram:
on THE LIGHTNING Being stopped AT THE DESIRE of QUEEN victoria.
Though CANUTE could not check the wave,
While rapidly the tide was heightening,
Victoria her orders gave,
And at her bidding stopp'd the Lightning.
On reaching the Nore Light the PRINCEss Roy AL fell into the
same error to which most juveniles are liable. Hearing that there
was a buoy in the water, the PRINCEss with characteristic kindness
wanted to have a rope thrown to the little fellow, but HER MAJESTY
having called for the Royal Spelling Book, and pointed out the happy
distinction drawn by MAvon between B-o-y Boy, and B-u-o-y Buoy,
the PRINCEss was found to be consolable. We ought, perhaps, to
have stated that at Woolwich, his Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT
was prevailed upon to take off the very unbecoming drab hat with the
black hat-band, and to substitute a naval undress cap,with a gold band.
While the foaming waves were swellin',
PRINCE ALBERT look’d extremely well in.
At Rosherville, BARoN NATHAN and a large body of retainers were
screaming on the pier as the squadron passed, but nobody heard
them, and their loyalty passed by as the idle wind, which nobody paid
any attention to. At Herne Bay, HER MAJESTY was exceedingly
desirous to view the place, having heard so much of it for the last
three years in Punch, and observing a select party of eleven at the
end of the pier, the QUEEN was graciously pleased to remark that
she presumed she had the pleasure of seeing all the inhabitants.
On pursuing the investigation through a powerful telescope, the one
policeman was seen brandishing his staff and entreating the crowd 11
to keep back, adding, that there was plenty of room for everybody.
Three o’Clock..—By this time the squadron was abreast of Har-
wich Harbour, and all the authorities were congregated at the end of
the pier, with an address; but the nearest vessel was ten miles off,
and, though the Mayor caused signals of distress to be thrown up
every ten minutes, the municipal authorities were compelled to dis-
perse, which they did, after a violent quarrel amongst themselves as
to whose fault it was that the deputation had failed in its object.
“At six o'clock,” says the Observer, with its customary acuteness,
“the royal squadron had left Aldborough far behind;” and, as our
contemporary thinks it a notable fact that the squadron had left
Aldborough behind, we presume that the Obserrer thought it very pos-
sible that the squadron, instead of leaving Aldborough behind, would
have taken it on as a part of the luggage.
The QUEEN, having taken an early tea, retired very soon to rest,
and Paince ALBERT repaired to the deck to smoke a quiet cigar
with the EARLs of Liverpool, and ABERDEEN. Loit D A Dolphus
FitzcLARENcE was invited to join the party, and, as PRINCE ALBERT
always makes a point of tasting the provisions dealt out to the men,
wherever he goes, some grog was brought to His Royal IIighness, on
the merits of which a council was held, which sat till a late hour.
The EARL or ABERDEEN, who is a high authority on foreign affairs,
gave a very favourable report as to the genuineness of a Bengal
cheroot, and his Lordship also received dispatches from the Havannahs,
with which he transacted business.
Tuesday.—This was an extremely flat day on board the royal
yacht ; and neither the Queen nor PRINCE ALBERT ventured on
deck, while the little Princess remained in her berth as quiet as
possible.
HER MAJESTY'S ARRIVAL AT DUNDEE.
Wednesday.—At half-past three, the royal yacht came to anchor
in the roadstead of Dundee, and a party of Native Dundeeians, with
the mayor at their head, anxious to avoid the error of the people of
Edinburgh, who were too late, came rattling, bellowing, and hailing
under the bows of the royal yacht, long before HER MAJEsty felt
disposed to get up to attend to them. In vain did Lord ADolphus
Fitzci. ARENce exclaim, “Hush, the QUEEN’s asleep !” in vain, did
the honest tars insist on the “land lubbers sheering off.”
The authorities of Dundee would not quit the yacht till they knew
the hour HER MAJEsty had appointed for landing. At length, the
QUEEN, aroused by the noise, inquired the reason, and having
ascertained the facts, good-humouredly exclaimed, through an open
port-hole, “Eight o'clock, my good people I come again at eight
o'clock '"
Such is our account of the Royal progress as far as Dundee, where
HER MAJEsty was received by the usual assemblage of authorities
and evergreens, triumphalarches, town councils, pocket handkerchiefs,
and pink calico; all of which she gracefully acknowledged by those
smiles which royalty is expected to wear on similar occasions.
HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED PICTURES.
This Institution is the building in Trafalgar Square, heretofore known
as the National Gallery. It is one fraught with melancholy interest.
Here is provided an asylum for the Old Masters during their progress to
decay; which its arrangements are in every way calculated to expedite.
They may be seen, in their respective wards, resting against the wall; an
incrustation of dust, dirt, and mildew quietly forming over them, and no
attempt at disturbing their latter days being made by interfering with it.
With feelings like those of Lord ByRon in the Coliseum, one surveys the
fading tints, vanishing outlines, and darkening canvass of RAPHAEL and
GUIDo, CoRREggio, and CARAcci, GAINsborough and HogaRTH. To think
how many of our old acquaintance are going ! Age is daily creeping upon
WANDyke and REMBRANDT; RUBENs is fast breaking up, and poor SIR
Joshua looks very ill. Everybody used to talk of the green old age of
GEvartius; his fine fresh colour has almost departed ; and his venerable
face is now quite smoky. Unfortunate VENUs, vainly attired by the
Graces, begins to look quite palely ; and ANDRome DA's complexion is
beyond the reach of Kalydor. Might we venture to suggest that a little
soap and water occasionally, a gentle dusting now and then, would really
do the patients no harm, and improve their looks considerably But
perhaps this would be giving the attendants too much trouble.
A spreaking likeness.
ROYAL FASHIONS.
PRINCE ALBERT's taste in hats seems to be rather singular, not only as
far as the military eap is concerned, but the civil tile selected by His
Royal Highness appears to bear the stamp of eccentricity. At the recent
embarkation of the Royal Family for Scotland, PRINCE Albert, we are
told, “wore a drab hat, with a deep mourning band,”—and a precious
Guy he must have looked in it. His Royal Highness appears to labour
under a sort of monomania with respect to hats, some extraordinary
specimen of which he seems continually doomed to run his head against.

Messieuns,
You have long raved about “Perfidious Albion,”—you

You have nourished yourselves upon such national rancour, as

And alas ! what now avails this magnanimous, this truly heroic

already near the throat of Albion the Perfidious, that in another

PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER,
LETTER XXIII.
FROM A WIDOWER TO A WIDOW, WITH AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE.
MY DEAR MADAM,
Your kind looks and cordial words have
accompanied me all the way home, and—the
truth is, I write this before going to bed; I shall
sleep the more soundly for having the matter off
my mind. It is true, we have met but once;
but we are both of us at that rational point of life, when people know
the most value of time; and as all ceremony is but an idle waste of
existence, I beg herewith to offer you my hand, and, with it, though
I have been married before, an entire heart. There are hearts,
nadam, allow me to say, all the better for keeping ; they become
inellower, and more worth a woman's acceptance than the crude,
unripe things, too frequently gathered—as children gather green
fruit—to the discomfort of those who obtain them. I have been
married to one wife, and know enough of the happiness of wedlock
to wish it to be continued in another. The best compliment I can
Pay to the dear creature now in heaven, is to seek another dear
creature here on earth. She was a woman of admirable judgment;
and her portrait—it hangs over my chimney-piece—smiles down upon
me as I write. She seems to know my thoughts, and to approve of
them. I said, madam, she was a woman of excellent judgment.
My means are tolerably good; more than sufficient for my widowed
state. Of the truth of this, your solicitor shall have the most satis-
factory proof. I have also heard—casually heard—that fortune
has not, my dearmadam, been blind to your deserts, and has awarded
you more than enough to keep the wolf from the door. I rejoice at
this; for whatever might be my disappointment, I would not entail
upon you the inconvenience of marriage unaccompanied by an agree-
able competence. What is enough for one—it has been said—is
enough for two. But this is the ignorance of Cupid, who never could
learn figures. Now Hymen—as you must know, dear madam—
is a better arithmetician; taught as he is by butcher and baker.
Love in a cottage is pretty enough for girls and boys; but men and
women like a larger mansion, with coach-house and stabling.
You may urge against me, that I have incumbrances. By no
means. My daughter having married a beggar, has ceased to have
any natural claim upon me. If I am civil to her, it is solely from a
certain weakness of heart that I cannot wholly conquer; and some-
thing too, moreover, to keep up appearances with a meddling world.
I have told her that she is never to expect a farthing from me, and I
should despise myself not to be a man of my word.
I have, too, a son ; but when I tell you that I have once paid his
3ebts, incurred in his wild minority, you will allow that, except my
blessing, and, at times, my paternal advice, he can expect nothing
more. I know the duties of a father, and will never satisfy the
cravings of a profligate. Nevertheless, he is my own son ; and what-
ever may be his need, my blessing and my counsel he shall never
want.
My health, madam, has ever been excellent. I have worn like
rock. I have heard of such things as nerves, but believe it my fate
to have been born without any such weaknesses. I speak thus
plainly of essentials, as you and I, madam, are now too wise to think
consumption pretty—to tie ourselves to ill-health, believing it vastly
interesting. I can ride forty miles a day, and take a hedge with any
fellow of five-and-twenty. I say, I speak of these things, that you
may know me as I am. Moreover, I assure you I eat with my own
teeth, and grow my own hair. Besides this, I am only two-and-fifty.
What do you say, madam : As for vices, as I am an honest man, I
do not think I can lay any to my charge. I may have my human
weaknesses—such, indeed, as I have touched upon above; but,
madam, it has ever been my study through life to be respectable: I
have the handsomest pew in the church, and don't owe any man a
shilling.
Well, my dearmadam, it is getting late, and I must conclude. I
hate to be out of bed after eleven—it is now past twelve. Hence,
you must perceive how very much I am interested in this business.
In another ten minutes I shall be asleep, and dreaming of you. May
I wake to find my dream—for I know what it will be—a reality
If our solicitors are mutually satisfied, will you name the day ! I
am superstitious about days—say, then, say Thursday week, and
believe me your devoted lover, till death,
Nicholas BLAckthon N.
P.S. May I see you to-morrow 1
LETTER XXIV.
S the WIDOW's ANswer.
IR,
You R favour of last night has, I own, surprised me. What
after one meeting, and that at a card-party, to make such an
offer | Well to be sure, you men are strange creatures | What,
indeed, could you have seen in my conduct to think I could look over
such boldness :
As for the rational point of life you speak of, I must confess I
know not when that exactly occurs; do you think it—at least with
women—at two-and-thirty: or if not, may I beg to know what age
you consider me ! Perhaps, though, my early and irreparable loss
may have brought a look of premature age upon me. It is very
possible—for what a man he was
As for what you say about hearts, sir, I know but little; I only
know the one I have lost. If I did pluck it green, like the winter-
apples in my store-room, it grew riper and riper in my care.
You say your wife's portrait smiled while you wrote. His dear
miniature is now before me; I think I see the tears starting through
the ivory as I look upon the precious features. If he ever could
have frowned, surely he would frown now to think—but I will not
pursue the theme.
As to your means, sir, I am happy to hear they are sufficient.
Although I can by no possibility have an interest in them, never-
theless I myself too well know the blessings of competence not to
congratulate you. True it is I know but little of the ways of money;
but am blessed in my solicitors, MEssrs. GRIP and NIP, No. —,
Furnival's-inn.
You speak of your incumbrances; my husband dying, left me
without a single one. That your daughter should have forgotten her
duty, is an affliction. I am glad, however, to find that you know the
true source of consolation, and refuse to lend yourself to her impro-
vidence. Truly, indeed, do you say it is a meddling world. I have
found it so; as some of my lamented husband's poor relations will
answer for me. However, as I could not endure the sight of any-
thing that reminded me of my dear lost treasure, I have left them
for ever in Cornwall. It is now some months since they have ceased
to distress me.
Your son may mend. If you will allow me as a stranger to speak,
I think you should still act with tenderness towards him. How very
little would pay his passage to Australia |
Health is, indeed, a treasure. I know it. Had I not had the
robustness—pardon the word – of a mountain nymph, I had never
survived the dreadful shock that cruel death has inflicted on me.
As it was, it struck me down. But, as the poet says, “the bulrush
rises when the oak goes crash.” -
You are partial to hunting It is a noble recreation. My depart-
ed lamb followed the hounds, and, as sportsmen say, would ride at
anything. He once broke his collar-bone; but, with good nursing,
we put him in the saddle again in a month. Ha! you should have
seen him in his scarlet coat I
In this fleeting life, how small and vain are personal gifts compared
to the treasures of the mind Still, if there is anything I admire, it
is fine teeth. A wig, at least in a man, is detestable.
You say you are two-and-fifty. Well, I must say, you don't look
that age.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CIIARIVARI.
You speak plainly of vices, and say you have none. It would be
ill manners in me, on so short—I may say, so very trivial—an
acquaintance, to doubt you. Besides, it has been my faith—and
what I have lost by it I hav'n't time to tell—to think well of every-
body. Weaknesses we all have. One of mine is, a love of a pew.
We think but very little of religion, when we forget proper hassocks.
I have, however, delayed you too long ; and indeed, except for
politeness' sake, know not why I should have written at all.
I therefore remain,
Your obedient Servant;
Ruth Double knot.
P.S.. I shall be out all day to-morrow. At present—I say at
present—I know of no engagement for the next day; no, not next
day—the day after; for I hate a Thursday.
LORD LONDON DERRY'S PROTEST.
It has hitherto escaped the notice of our contemporaries that
Lond London DERRY has placed a protest on the journals of the
House, which, for conciseness of style, and closeness of reasoning, is
certainly very far superior to anything of even the late LonD IIol-
LAND's. The reader will remember that the Lay Lords upon the late
writ of error were entreated by the Lond WHARNcliff E not to
vote, as, having heard none of the arguments, they could not be sup-
posed to know anything of the matter. Load London DERRY's protest
is, it will be seen, a tremendous blow at this new and very dangerous
doctrine,
33rotest.
That having sat many years in the House of Lords—(in the same
House which has been decorated by the eloquence of my late
lamented relative, that did more for Ireland than any other states-
man which has ever lived)—I hold it to be altogether and wholly
unconstitutional—completely and entirely and in every part subver-
sive of the rights of the Peers of the United Kingdom which they are
born to and hold by birthright, to refrain from voting on the egre-
gious and radical doctrine that they do not understand what they
vote upon.
That it is a constitutional and no less agreeable fiction of the law
that Peers are supposed to be born knowing everything : and that
even if they know nothing—which is never the case—when they are
elevated to the upper House, such elevation does inmediately impart
to them all the science of government. They take such science as
children take the small-pox, by mixing with them which have it.
That with this belief I have unhesitatingly voted, and ever should
wish to vote, upon any and every question : and that if I have not
exercised my born birthright upon the late writ of error, it is simply
because I was not in the House, and for no other cause, let, or
hindrance whatsoever.
That firmly attached to the constitution—which my lamented
relative did more to uphold than any other Minister which ever was
—I have entered this protest, that my late absence (and with it my
unavoidable silence) may not be taken for a precedent.
That to forego this privilege would soon reduce the British consti-
tution to the state of Constantinople (my Voyage to which is still to
be had at a reduced price, in a new edition, of MR. Colnu RN, Marl-
borough-street). 31693?IDOſ):BCElitt?
INTENTIONS OF FRANCE.
Esolutely determined there should be no war
between France and England, still we
may as well let our countrymen know what
they might have expected in the event of
hostilities; for we have succeeded in
finding out the plans of the French from
a commercial traveller, in an Algerine
beard, who was bringing some ribands
from Paris—a pattern of which, as he be-
longed to the Legion of Honour, he was
privileged to wear in his button-hole.
The French intended to have landed
200,000 men at Folkestone, so that WAN-
TELINI, of the Pavilion Hotel, would have
been prettily puzzled how to accommodate
his gallant countrymen. They would have
taken a special train up to the Bricklayers'
Arms, sacking the receipts of the company
at all the stations on the road up ; and they would then have bivouacked
on Kennington Common. The next morning they would have marched
into London, pillaged the Mint, turned the coffers of the Bank inside out,
and have proceeded thence by omnibus to the West End, where they
would have declared England a republic in the middle of Regent's Circus.
They would then have marched on Paddington, bombarded the Yorkshire
Stingo, and sent a detachment round St. James's Park to spike the gun
belonging to the Gun Tavern, immediately opposite Buckingham Palace.
They would then have taken a special train to Slough, and dictated the
terms of peace at Windsor Castle. Before showing the heads of a treaty,
they were to insist on having the heads of all the Ministers, particularly
that of the Duke of Wellington ; after which they purposed deposing
the Queen, and installing Tom Duncombe as First Consul, assisted by
FEARGus O'Connon and Joseph Hume, as Tribunes of the people.
It will be seen that the whole of this account is very complete and
substantial, as far as the French are concerned ; but the statement omits
altogether one very essential point—namely, how the English meant to
employ themselves while the scenes above described were being enacted.
BEAUTY AND BUSINESS versus EARLY SHOPS.
We have received the following communications from persons interested
against the early closure of linen drapers' shops; and, on the principle of
hearing both sides of a question, we insert them :-
MR. Punch—SIR,
Your wife ought to pull your ears; wouldn't I, if I were Judy f
I will tell you why; for trying, as you do, to get linen-drapers to close their
shops at eight or nine o'clock. Suppose a lady, late on Saturday night,
sees, in the Magasin de Modes, a new lilac, or lavender (and it's just the
same with a shawl), that she would like to appear in at church the next
day, why now all she has to do is to go and get it : whereas if the shops were
shut, she would have to wait till the following Monday; and how would
you like that, if you were in her place By the time Monday came, very
likely she wouldn't want it at all ; and it isn't always convenient for a lady
to go out in the morning. , Do be a little considerate, Mr. Punch, really,
it is too bad of you. Hoping you will excuse haste and spelling, &c.
UNE Elºgante.
P.S. As to the young men sitting up an hour or so, getting pale, and
having little headaches, what is that to a lady's disappointment 1
PUNCH !
What business have you to dictate to us as to when we ought
to shut up shop : . It is no affair of yours. A man has a right to do
what he likes with his own ; and his shop is his own ; and so are the shop-
men in it, as long as he pays them. You talk about their wanting
recreation ; but why are they to have recreation at our expense What
do we get by their recreation : Their “mental culture,” as you call it,
is nothing to us. We hire them to increase our business, not to improve
their minds. Besides, we do very well without it, and why shouldn't
they As to their morals, I’m sure we attend quite enough to them.
We teach them not to embezzle goods, or rob the till ; and we prosecute
them if they do. Besides, morals may be carried too far. An assistant
must stretch a point, now and then, to get an article off. A pretty sort of
morals, too, I call it, to cheat an employer out of three or four hours a
day. At 4s. a day's wages, reckoning fifteen hours a day, four hours
would be 1s. 0}d., and a fraction over, downright plunder. What have you
got to say to that As to injuring their health by confinement and late
hours, that is their look out. Our object is to get as much work out of
them as we can ; if they don't like it, they may leave it.

DREADFUL STATE OF DESTITUTION.
YEstERDAY, a miserable object—we present his portrait—was
brought up before Sin PETER LAURIE, at Guildhall, by Policeman
A 1, who stated that he had taken the prisoner into custody on the
heinous charge of begging. He had found him seated on the pave-
ment, the culprit having written thereon with chalk “I am starving.”
The general boldness and flourish of the writing was of the most
hardened description. Several of the aldermen had been consider-
ably disgusted with it, as another evidence of the effrontery of the
lower classes. -
Sir Peter Laurie. Starving, eh? Humph a growing abuse. I must
put it down in the same way that I crushed suicide. What is your
name, my man and what your occupation ?
Prisoner. My name's my own property, and I shall keep it to my-
self. As for my occupation (here the prisoner laughed hysterically), my
occupation's gone.
Sir Peter. Come, come, no laughing here. I’m an alderman, and
won't allow such fellows as you to write “starving ” on the
Queen's highway, with the London Tavern, Binch's, and a hundred
cook-shops beside, in the City. What are you ?
Here the policeman informed SIR PETER that the prisoner was
the Clown of Richandson's Show. Since last Bartholomew's-day
he had been wandering about the City—abusing the Court of Alder-
men—swearing that they had robbed him of his birthright—and that
he’d have compensation, or his friend Lou D BRough AM should
know it.
Sir Peter. Oh, oh And pray, fellow, is this true :
Prisoner. Yes, it is ; even though the policeman swears it. The
Court of Aldermen have robbed me of my birthright. I was born
a Clown—I have a wested interest in Bartlemy Fair, and was brought
up to get my living by making a fool of myself: and now, the Court
of Aldermen, like a pack of amatoors—
Policeman. He means amateurs, your worship.
Prisoner. Didn't I say so Like a pack of amatoors, come and
take the bread out of my mouth. Is flesh and blood to stand this
I married the Ghost of the Show—as sweet a cretur as ever stood
in a white sheet—on the strength of Bartlemy Fair: I’m the father
of a family on the understanding that Bartlemy should last for ever.
And now it's put down, I should like to know why I'm not to have
what they call compensation ? I can't do nothing but grin, and
what's to become of me? I tumbled from the werry breast, and
now I’m brought to a stand-still.
Here the worthy magistrate, becoming visibly affected, asked the
prisoner what had become of the rest of the troop.
Prisoner. Why, the Pantaloon's married the Columbine—she'd
saved five pound—and gone into the baked tatur business. The
Harlequin now and then gets a job as mute with his cousin, an
undertaker. As for me, why I tell you—me and the Ghost of my
bosom is starving ! -
Sir Peter. Nevertheless, you mustn't write “starving” in the City
—it is offensive to the aldermen, and, as I say, is flying in the faces
of the chop-houses.
Prisoner (much excited). Will the aldermen give me compensation,
then
Sir Pater. Be quiet, my man. Impossible 1
Prisoner. Will they buy my Clown's dress, then It's sure to fit
some of 'em.
Sir Peter. Quite out of the question. Notwithstanding, I feel such
an interest in you—I may almost say that it amounts to a sympathy,
that—
Prisoner. Heaven bless you, SIR PETER I
Sir Peter. That I will see what can be done for you and your wife.
Hereupon SIR PETER directed the officer to go to Ma. Osbal-
D1ston, of the Victoria Theatre, to inquire if, with his known
benevolence, he could not give shelter in his asylum to the unhappy
couple.
In a short time the officer returned with a letter to SIR PETER
from MR. O., stating that he should be happy to engage the prisoner
for the next Christmas pantomime, and that there would always be
employment for his wife, the Ghost, in the continual run of some
domestic drama.
The poor fellow was so overcome with gratitude, that he threw a
summerset out of court.
THE LAW IN DANGER:
Aving heard of the panic caused in the legal
profession by the passing of Lond
BRough AM's Bill, we were not
astonished when we were told that an
association will shortly be formed
under the name of the “Pettifog-
gers' Protection, United Bailiffs'
and Amicable Turnkeys' Society,”
the object of which will be to re-
serve the classes above named from
that gulf—which, in anticipation of
their ultimate descent into a larger
abyss, threatens immediately to
swallow them. We have been given
to understand that the following
resolutions will be proposed at the
preliminary meeting:—
- That Lord BRough AM's bill is
calculated to injure the trade in parchment, by diminishing the number
of writs—and is, therefore, in direct opposition to one of our greatest
commercial interests.
That the iron works of this country give employment to several thou-
sands of souls. That it is expedient to preserve our manufacturing
superiority. That iron gives employment to an enormous amount of
labour and capital; and that Lord Brough AM's bill will cripple this branch
of our industry by lessening the demand for bolts, locks, and bars to our
prisons, and that, therefore, all the great iron making districts ought
immediately to organise an opposition to this very obnoxious measure.
That it is a grand principle of philosophy to turn an evil into a good–
and to derive a profit from misfortune. That the attorneys, bailiffs, and
turnkeys have hitherto profited largely from the misfortunes of other
people—a piece of practical philosophy which Load Bhough AM's bill will
henceforth render impossible. (It will be seen from the above resolutions
that self-interest has nothing whatever to do with the hostility to Loni,
Brough AM's new measure.) The objections to it are founded on a deep
sympathy with the parchment and iron trade, as well as a zealous regard
for the principles of practical philosophy.
ANOTHER NEW COMET.
(From our own Astronomer.)
Having read a letter in the Times from Professor South, who has dis-
covered another Comet which nobody can see, I took out my lorg.nette, and
watched with considerable intensity. Having detected a bit of coagulated
vapour in an altitude of two and a half, I looked for its right ascension,
but as it did not ascend right, but was left on the end of my glass, I dis-
covered that the phenomenon was occasioned by a bit of what is usually
termed flue, or flough, adhering to the end of my opera-glass. Having
manoeuvred a little so as to get my lorg.nette to a better focus, I continued
my observations, and ultimately espied what I suppose must have been
the Comet, and which the following table may perhaps enable the public
to trace the course of.

138 PUNCH,
APPROPRIATE AIRS.
The custom of following the giving of
toasts at public dinners by appropriate airs,
is all very well if it can be carried com-
pletely out, but when some of the toasts
will admit of the arrangement and others
will not, the effect may be occasionally
rather awkward. The other day, at the
dinner given to SIR Robert SALE, the
health of Her Majesty was followed, very
properly, by “God save the Queen ;” but
when it came to the PRINCE of WALEs, and
the rest of the Royal Family, there was no
air that seemed particularly appropriate,
and the glee-singers unfortunately struck
up the popular ditty of “That's the wa
the money goes,” a contre temps which
was happily put an end to by the band
commencing, fortissimo, the “Prince of
Wales's March,” thus effectually drowning
the efforts of the glee-singers.
But the funniest combination of the
evening was the health of SIR R. A. FER-
guson, BART., the Member for the City,
with the song of “I’m ower young to
marry yet." We should be glad to know
the honourable baronet's age, and whether
he has any idea of marrying; and if so,
whether he is considered “ower young” to
enter into the state of matrimony.
THE HUNGERFORD SUSPENSION
BRIDGE.
It has just occurred to the proprietors
of this snug little footway, that it will pay
by adding a railroad to it. They have got
the bridge and they now only want the
railway, a state of things which reminds us
of the boy who had got a watch-key and
only wanted a gold watch to add to it. If
the proprietors are desirous of uniting
with a railway, why not fraternise with the
Kensington concern; a bridge that nobody
wants to go over, would be an excellent
adjunct to a railway nobody wants to go
by, and as the two speculations are deci-
dedly two negatives as far as profit is con-
cerned, it is just possible that an affirmative
might arise out of them. An uninter-
rupted communication between Wormwood
Scrubbs and the Belvidere Brewery might
stand a chance of being visited from a
feeling of curiosity, and the very absurdity
of the thing would render it to a certain
extent an object of interest. |

D'AUBIGNY REPRIMANDED.
Mons. Guizot has undertaken to order CAPTAIN BRUAT to repri-
mand M. D'Aubigny for his conduct to PRitchand. The solemnity
will, we understand, be performed in the following manner:—
Bauar will be seated at a table with bottles and glasses before him.
He will then order D'Aubigny to be brought into his presence.

—and you are reprimanded accordingly. (D'Aubigny bows.) Now,

And, until a late hour in the evening, D'Aubigny continues to be
reprimanded.
English Politicians Abroad.
The Whigs are all gone upon their travels, the country having left
them quite free to aller promener as long as they find it agreeable.
Speculation is very busy as to the motives by which some of the leading
politicians are influenced; and it is roundly asserted that Lord John
Russel L. has been into Germany with the intention of “warming up old
animosities against France.” This seems to be a most unprofitable branch
of political cookery; for, whoever tries to warm up old animosities, is
likely to make a pretty hash of it. -

INCIDENTS OF THE ROYAL TRIP.
THE report of Her Majesty's progress announces the important fact
that during a heavy shower PRINCE ALBERT refused to go below, but
took shelter abaft the paddle-box. His Royal Highness must have stuffed
himself in somewhere between the kitchen and the gunwale, but he
evidently kept his weather eye disengaged, for the report adds that he
was able to command a view of surrounding objects. Amongst the sur-
rounding objects the EARLs of Liverpool and ABERDEEN are particularly
mentioned.
The Archaeological Bociety.
Punch has to apologize to this learned body, that in consequence of an
excruciating press of matter, he is not enabled to give up so * of his
columns as he could wish, to a report of their proceedings. He will,
however, next week, make sure amendment. He has been favoured by
JAMEs Robinson PLANché, Esq., F.R.S.A., with the MS. of his forth-
coming paper, “On the Origin, Progress, and Uses of the Shoulder-knot.”
This paper forms a companion essay to that read at Canterbury by the
learned gentleman on the Buckle, and will, furthermore, be illustrated
with a very handsome portrait of the author.

LETTER XXV.
FROM A CLERGYMAN TO A CHURCHwardEN, EccENTRIC IN HIS
ACCOUNTS.
It is now two years since the horrors of
fiscal war broke out in our once peaceful parish of
Wholehog-cum-Applesauce. For two years, sir, have
the affrighted parishioners had their souls and pockets
torn by thoughts of mammon—for two years have
they nightly fallen to sleep to groan and writhe beneath a nightmare
sitting on their breasts in the horrid shape of a Churchwarden,
grinning and hugging in his arms an iron-clasped account-book
Neither sex nor age has escaped the evil influence of the time: old
women wax older when they talk of Churchwarden GRIPPs ; and the
faces of little children become sharp and thin as sixpences when
they stammer out his name. True it is, the parishioners have put
you in the cage of Chancery; nevertheless, with a magnanimous
philosophy, you do nothing but make mouths at them through the
bars 1
*
Dear sir, pause—consider. Have you not done enough for history?
Is it possible, think you, that the fame—such as it is—of Church-
warden GRIpps can die whilst the parish of Wholehog-cum-Apple-
sauce shall endure Will not its annals preserve until the latest day
a thousand memoranda of the peculiar reputation of Gnipps Whilst
arithmetic shall remain to man, can they ever be forgotten Why,
then, be thus gluttonous of glory? Why crave for more renown, when
some folks vow it is impossible for you to stand upright with the
load already on your shoulders ?
Dear Churchwarden, consider the danger of your present con-
dition. For years and years have you borne the bag of Wholehog.
cum-Applesauce. You have been the depository of the hopes of
the parish; and if—as with a golden tongue you have declared
it—the people owe you monies, blush not, but take the balance.
Let your mystic books be opened; call in pundits for the work, and
let the Cabala of Wholehog-cum-Applesauce be revealed to the
vulgar. Then, how joyfully will your debtors pay their dues to the
Churchwarden ; while, on the other hand, if you should have
slumbered in error—for even Churchwardens are men—with what
serene delight will you pen a cheque upon the fortunate banker who
holds in trust the hoard of Gnipps 1
Dear sir, you have been abused—sorely abused. You say it—all the
world know it. Unhappily, it is the infirmity of men to throw any-
thing but crowns of flowers upon him they deem their debtor; and
true it is, you do not walk in the odour of roses. It was one of the
thousand fallacies by which the Romans hectored it over the world,
that “money has no smell.” Never believe it, dear Gaipps. There
is some money that will turn the sweetest Christian into a human
pole-cat.
Consider what a plight are we all brought into by these pestilent
accounts : Enter the Church of Wholehog-cum-Applesauce—survey
its wants—take some leisure solemn half-hour, and pace up and
down its aisles: Tears will trickle down your nose, and your noble
heart will lie melting in your breast like green fat in the platter
of an alderman. You will weep, sir—I am sure of it—you will
weep, and your trembling and repentant hand will, with awakened
instinct, unbutton for once your breeches' pocket.
Give ear to the sorrows of the people of the church. Myself, sir,
its unworthy minister, would be very happy to hand you a receipt for
arrears of salary. You are my debtor; but I pass my own claim,
and implore for others.
Our organist, sir—our tuneful musician—lacks payment of some five
quarters. I’very touch of his subtle fingers has been for fifteen
months a touch upon credit. Can you think of this, sir, and surrender
up your Sabbath heart to the solemnity of pealing fugues Alas,
sir! with these teazing accounts upon your mind, does not some
evil genius strike all religious harmony from out the music—does it
not to your ear profanely change the hundredth psalm into the
worldly discord of The Miser thus a Shilling sees? And then our church
bells that should call like comforting angels to your Sabbath soul—
alas, sir, and alas !—what do you hear in them 1 Nothing, but three
horrid, clanging notes—£ s. d. £ s. d. 42 s. d. 1
Our sexton, sir—poor, patient creature —for a year and a half he
has not known the sweets of income. Consider it, dear sir, consider
it; a day must come, when you will need his service. Therefore,
that you may meet that day with Christian peace, ponder on the
troubles of Wholehog-cum-Applesauce—allay the tumults—pay
arrears—cure all heart-burnings—make straight your accounts, and
believe me,
Your earnest well-wisher,
GILEAD BALM,
LETTER XXVI.
The CHURCHWARDEN'S ANSWER.
SIR
As I consider your letter a very great impertinence, you
will take any answer to it as, upon my part, a remarkable condescen-
sion. I had made up my mind to go out of the world without ever
deigning to write or speak again of the accounts of Wholehog-cum-
Applesauce. I feel that they ought to be beneath my notice: but so
it is—throughout the whole of this fiscal war, as you are pleased to
call the present atheistic revolution of the parish—I have been over-
flowing with a courtesy, a gentleness, that has only increased the
audacity of my slanderers. I have been meek and unresisting, and
so I have been trampled upon. But, sir, a worm will turn, and, by
consequence, so will the Churchwarden of Wholehog-cum-Apple-
Sauce
The parishioners hare certainly put me into Chancery. What of
it The people at the Zoological Gardens have put a brown beat
into a pit ; and the fine fellow still climbs to the top of his pole, and
squatting there, looks with surly contempt upon the poor creatures
who, whatever they may say of him, dare not come to close quarters.
Take your answer out of that, sir. -
I have law upon my side—law, sir, which I should hope is stronger
than any arithmetic you may please to talk of. I am Churchwarden
of Wholehog-cum-Applesauce for life: for there is a divine right of
churchwardens as well as of kings. As a scholar and a man of some
sense, you ought to know that I was born for the office. At all
events, come what may, I intend to die in it.
You ask me to throw open my books to the vulgar eyes of the
whole world ! What next No, sir, it is enough for me to know that
the parish is in my debt; and if I do not arrest every man, woman,
and child in it for the arrears, I only show a considerateness and a
humanity for which myself to myself has always been distinguished.
I know nothing about the Romans, and want to know nothing.
They were, I believe, a set of heathens, who never knew the blessings
of a Churchwarden. I believe, however, with you, that money has a
smell, and a sweet smell too, or how, as a man of wealth, should I
still be hugged and caressed by so many friends in the City .
You invite me to take a turn in your church. No, sir; until the
brawls which now disturb it shall have ceased, I will never enter it.
I shall perform my devotions in a place where parishioners are
obedient, and churchwardens are respected.
As for your claim, sir, I wonder at the hardihood with which you
make it, when you consider the heavy balance there is between the
parish and myself. , Decency should have taught you better:. . . .
As for the organist, I very much doubt whether a parish that is in
debt should encourage such a luxury. I know that I should never
think of spending my money in music whilst I owed money to a
living soul.
Your sexton, too, has claims for wages. Poor man I am sorry–
very sorry for him; but as I have made up my mind to have a public
funeral in either Westminster Abbey or Saint Paul's, I shall, of
VoI. VII.-1844.

course, be under no obligations to the sexton of Wholehog-cum-
Applesauce.
And now, sir, to conclude : You have, among you, placed me in
Chaneery. There I shall remain, and take the cast of the dice.
What I do you think I would call in accountants and so end the
matter 1 I should think not. You know not how sweet to me is the
hubbub I have made. When folks can't afford real turtle, they make
themselves as comfortable as possible with mock; for callipee and
callipash they content themselves with plain calf's-head. In like
way with other men, if they are not able to make a high reputation,
they will at least, by hook or by crook, lay hold of notoriety. Now,
reputation to notoriety is what real turtle is to mock. . If I am con-
tented with the humbler dish—with the mere calf's-head—I best show
my humility, and at the same time remain,
Your obedient humble servant,
Eben Ezen GRIPPs.

HER MAJESTY IN THE CITY.
HE QUEEN and PRINCE ALBERT are to
dine in the City on the opening of
the Royal Exchange. It may not
be generally known that the City is
indebted for this glory to the persever-
ance and great moral energy of MR.
LAMBERT Jones, who seems to have
a peculiar genius for drawing out
crowned heads. It was his indomi-
table politeness—aided and abetted
by the kindred spirit of Laurie—that
dragged the King of Saxony, with
his unmunched luncheon in his
mouth, from the Mansion House to
confront the WELLING-Ton Statue
world ; and we repeat, it is to the
invincible courtesy of Jones that the City owes, the forthcoming
visit of QUEEN Victonia. Indeed, it was found impossible by her
Majesty to withstand the invitation of Jones, who some days since
flung himself into the Slough third-class train, and taking omnibus for
Windsor, proceeded to the Castle. Having pulled the bell, and
given a double knock at her Majesty's door, Jones gave in his card,
desiring an instant interview with the Queen. To the astonishment
of the “King of the City”his card was refused, and he was unceremo-
niously bid to go about his business. A weaker spirit would have
quailed beneath this rebuff. Not so, LAMBERt Jones. He imme-
diately retired to the Garter Hotel, and there penned a letter to the
QUEEN, of which letter Jones has, in the most handsome manner,
favoured us with the subjoined copy:-
“Parlour of the Garter Hotel,
“My very DEAR MADAM, Windsor, September —.
“I—that is—we of the City are about to open our New Exchange,
a fine building, a very fine building, I assure you. . You will be particu-
larly struck by the figures which I have had perched about it, as a sort of
exercise for the dull intellects of my fellow-citizens. As yet, nobody but
myself knows what they mean, and, between you and me, the secret shall
die with me. However, to business.
“On the day of opening, we intend to get up a little dinner; and I
need not say, my very dear Madam, how much it will delight me, and
indeed the whole City, if on that day you will take pot-luck with us. Come,
and bring your Husband and Children with you—there shall be room
º for all, and nobody shall be more welcome.
“Say you will come, and I will meet yourself and amiable family at
the Paddington Station at any hour you may name.
“It was my intention to have personally invited you, but the people at
the Castle, strangely enough, denied me admittance. I therefore retired
to this hostelry, and in a pint of brown sherry drank your health and the
rest of the Royal Family.
“Trusting, my dear Madam, that it may harmonize with your many
arrangements to pick a bit with us on the day appointed,

COURSE OF STUDY FOR A PRINCE.
The following course of study is recommended for a young Prince ;
and distinguished examples prove it to be highly princely :-
1. Philosophy.

be delivered by Professors Moses and WILson ; the latter gentleman
to undertake the principles, and the former their application.
2. NATURAL. History.
Lectures on the Canine Species ; with peculiar reference to its more
nondescript varieties; as to the Physiology of the Turnspit, the Uses of
the Pug, and the Habits and Manners of the Poodle. The Lecturer
might be appointed by the Parliamentary Dog Committee, who may
perhaps select him from the venders of the animals in question who
frequent the Quadrant.
3. ARCHITECTURE.
A Discourse on Foundation-stones, with Directions for laying them,
and a Dissertation on the Gilt Trowel, with the Mode of Handling thereof.
This Punch will be happy to deliver himself; and he would introduce a
Disquisition on Perfumed Mortar, which he hopes would blend entertain-
ment with novelty.
4. LANGUAGEs.
The Application of the English Tongue to the Answering of Addresses
of Congratulation. An Essay, to be composed by the joint efforts of the
Cabinet.
5. AccomplishMENTs.
Instruction in Dancing and Deportment, by some Nobleman of course;
and who could give it better than BARon Nathan
Instruction in Music. Preceptor, M. JULLIEN undoubtedly.
Instruction in Riding—especially as exhibited in the Clearing of Five-
barred Gates—need we propose our Widdicombe for Tutor?
Instruction in Field-sports, by the prototype—whoever he is—of MR.

Punch will be satisfied with a moderate sinecure for the above
suggestions.

MR. Punch,
At the late “martyr” banquet, the Rev. MR, MAGUIRE rashly
observed, that “the mantle of Moses had fallen upon O'Connell.” Now,
sir, as the reverend gentleman could not by possibility mean any other
than our firm, we here beg leave to state that we have never made mantle,
cloak, or any thing else for the said DANIEL O'Connell.

P.S. We have, however, an elegant assortment of strait-waistcoats,
which we beg to recommend to the attention of the friends of MR. HeNRY

Qſbt &rtbtrologital $0títtp.
ANY persons may not be aware
that the Archaeologians are a
body of savans who devote their
whole lives to the unrolling of
mummies, the opening of bar-
rows, and the pick-axing of
ancient tumuli. A select few of
these enthusiasts have lately
been playing “Mag's diversion”
with the antiquities of Canter-
bury, and the Dean has very
injudiciously, but very good-
naturedly, allowed them the run
of the Cathedral.
It is a mercy that the whole
building did not tumble about their ears, for they have been grubbing
away at the foundations, under the vague idea that they should get at
PUNCH*S FINE ART DISTRIBUTION.
InspIRED by the extraordinary (the very extraordinary) success of
similar speculations, Mr. Punch contemplates the possibility of getting
together a large sum of money, a portion of which he has no objection to
give back again in the shape of
P R Z E S.
Every Subscriber of sixpence will have his choice of
oNE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NUMBERs of PUNCH,
one of which will be delivered at once on the sixpence being paid, together
with the
Chance of Obtaining a Prize,
if he happens to get one, in the contemplated Fine Art Distribution. Any
person persuading six friends to pay threepence each, will be entitled to
A SEVENTH PUNCH FOR HIMSELF
on the payment of threepence, which will also give him a claim to one of
interesting bones, and they have dug up a series of bricks which they the
declare will form materials for the future historian. If that had been
the case, Gibbon would have written his Decline and Fall among a lot of
dry rubbish, and HUME would have pursued his researches among the
curious collections of John Johnson, SoN, and BIRD, who were the leading
dustmen of his own era. For our own parts, we have little sympathy
with the Archaeologians, and, therefore, though we hear they have lately
opened a barrow, we care not to inquire whether it is a baker's barrow,
or an ordinary barrow, which, by-the-by, could scarcely be opened, for
it has generally no top to it.
The unrolling of mummies is a sort of monomania with MR. PETTIGREw,
and as the eccentricity is harmless, we do not see that it calls for the
energies of a commissioner of lunacy. The most interesting part of the
proceedings of the Archaeological Society appears to have been the reading
of the papers, one of which we subjoin, as it is from the able pen of MR.
J. R. PLANchk, who has judiciously chosen the subject of the Buckle,
which perhaps is capable of as much point as anything that he could
possibly have selected for an Archaeological essay. In the last week's
number of Punch another paper had been promised, but as the portrait
of the author is not yet completed, it has been thought better to give the
paper on the Buckle in all its primitive purity :-
PAPER ON THE BUCKLE.
In rising to treat of the Buckle, I feel my own tongue-(every Buckle,
it must be observed, has a tongue)—sticking to the roof of my mouth, be-
cause I feel overwhelmed with the importance of my subject. Buckles
are of very ancient origin. It is supposed that the first Buckles ever
known in this country were brought over from Normandy by the Con-
queror and some of his nobles, who wore them on their shoes ; but finding
the Buckle was not so fashionable as the old cothurni, or shoe-strings, the
Norman nobles buried their Buckles on entering London, and Buckles-
bury, corrupted by time into Bucklersbury, no doubt had its name from
the fact alluded to. After this period, we lose sight of the Buckle for
nearly three centuries, until we find it at the end of a leather strap, in the
shop of a barber, who flourished in the very middle of the dark ages.
Again, we lose all trace of the Buckle till the year 1825, when it bursts
upon our astonished senses in the shape of a prize at Brook Green Fair, in
the Lucky Bag. I do not think it necessary to branch off into the subject
of Brook Green Fair, or go deeply into Lucky Bags, or any bags at all, at
the present moment; but on some other occasion, I hope to dive into that
fine mine of Archaeological lore, and trace the Bag in all its stages, from
the sack in which SIR WALTER RAleigh first brought potatoes over to this
country, down to the horse's nose-bag of later date, and the still more
recent reticule. (Cheers.)
To return, however, to the Buckle—(IIear)—the Buckle to which I last
alluded was improperly denominated, in the fortunate ticket by which it
was drawn, “a silver breast-buckle ; ” but I have had the assistance of an
accomplished Archaeologian, who had preserved one of these buckles, and
by holding it over a lighted candle in an iron spoon, we found the buckle
to be made of pewter or some other metal—say lead–of equal ductility.
º I have in my pocket one or two specimens of Buckles, the
nest of which is the Buckleius Melodramaticus, or equilateral tri-tongued
buckle, which is usually to be found on the girldles of smugglers at the
Minor Theatres. There is also the Buckleius Vitreus, or glassy
buckle, worn chiefly by testy guardians on their shoes in genteel comedies.
Having now exhausted the Buckle, and I fear very much fatigued you
(No-not very much), I bring my observations to a close ; and I hope that
the Buckle may long remain a type of that union which a society like this
ought always to be cemented by. (The learned Archaeologian resumed
his seat amidst loud and long-continued cheering.)
Who'll TAKE 100 to 1 that the Duke of CAMBRIDGE is present at
the Dunner given at the opening of the Royal Exchange
SPLEND ID LARGE CARICATURES
which have appeared in any of the numbers of the work that are already
published.
The Prizes will consist of 60,000 volumes of Punch, amounting to the
value of
$220,000,
The Prizes being in the proportion of one to every thirty subscribers
of sixpence, threepence of which will be returned at once in the shape of
the current number.
Among the splendid Numbers, from which a selection may be made,
will be found

(To siR JAMES GRAHAM.)
It is understood to be your intention to bring in, during the next
Session of Parliament, a Bill for Medical Reform. It is generally
admitted that the Law wants reforming just as much as Medicine, and
that you are equally competent to legislate on either subject. Your
above-mentioned Bill includes, I am told, a clause, empowering certain
unqualified practitioners, otherwise quacks, to pursue their calling with
impunity. Sir, I belong to a much-injured class of men, debarred, at
present, from getting an honest living, except at their peril ; and I claim
your protection for myself and my fraternity. I humbly hope you will
couple Legal with Medical Reform, and that you will, in so doing, repeal
that enactment which imposes upon all persons who wish to practise
Law, the necessity of articles, study, examination, and other expenses
and hardships. The unskilful physician can only kill a few patients, the
ignorant attorney can but ruin a client or two ; and I put it to you to
say, in common fairness, which is of the greater consequence, life or .
property. I am, Sir, -

DIRECTIONS TO LADIES FOR SHOPPING.
Shopping is the amusement of spending money at shops. It is to a lady
what sporting is to a gentleman; somewhat productive, and very charge-
able. Sport, however, involves the payment of one's own shot; shopping
may be managed by getting it paid for. Ride all the way till you come to
the shopping-ground in a coach, if you can ; in an omnibus, if you must ;
lest you should be tired when you get there. If you are a lady of
fashion, do not get out of your carriage; and when you stop before your
|
º |
milliner's, particularly if it is a cold, wet day, make one of the young
women come out to you, and without a bonnet, in her thin shoes, stand
on the kerb-stone in the damp and mud. The best places for shopping
are fashionable streets, bazaars, and the like. Street-shopping principally
relates to hosiery, drapery, and jewellery of the richer sort. Bazaar and
Arcade-shopping, to fancy articles, nick-nacks, and perfumery. In street-
shopping walkleisurely along, keeping a sharp look-out on the windows. In
bazaar-shopping, beat each stall separately. Many patterns, colours, novel-
ties, conveniences, and other articles will thus strike your eye, which you
would otherwise have never wanted or dreamt of. When you have marked
down some dress, orriband, for instance, that you would like, go and inquire
the price of it; haggle, demur, examine, and, lastly, buy. You will then
be asked “whether there is any other article to-day?” Whether there is
or not, let the shopman show you what wares he pleases; you will very likely
desire one or more of them. Whatever you think very cheap, that buy,
without reference to your need of it; it is a bargain. You will find, too,
as you go on, that one thing suggests another; as bonnets—ribands for
trimming, or flowers; and handkerchiefs—perfumery. In considering
what more you want, try and recollect what your acquaintances have got
that you have not ; or what you have seen worn by strangers in going
along. See if there is anything before you superior in any respect to a
similar thing which you have already; if so, get it instantly, not reflect-
ing whether your own will do well enough. You had better finish your
streets before you take your bazaars and arcades; for there the shopping,
which one might otherwise call cover-shopping, though excellent sport,
refers mostly to articles of no manner of use; and it may be as well to
reserve toys and superfluities to the last. Married ladies, when they have
laid in all they want for themselves, are recommended to show their
thoughtfulness by purchasing some little trifle for their husbands, who, of
course, will have to pay for it in the end.
LEGAL INTELLIGENCE AT FOLKSTONE.
He other day, Ma. BARon ALDEason
went an extraordinary circuit, or, in
other words, a tremendous round from
the Pier at Folkstone to the waiting-
room of the Custom House, where he
held avery tedious sitting in (wooden)
Banco, while several cases (of luggage)
were being disposed of. The learned
Baron opened the commission by em-
ploying a commissioner, who acted as
associate protem, carrying the judicial
sac de nuit, umbrella and mackintosh.
The learned Baron having taken his
seat, alluded to the motion of course, of the steamer, which he had
recently gone into, and then proceeded to try a demurrer, by de-
murring to other people's luggage being looked at before his ºwn was
examined. The demurrer having completely broken down, his lordship
called for the list of the day's business, and ascertained that short
causes were being taken first, that is to say, people with one package
were having their baggage first looked into. The learned Baron
coincided in the justice of this proceeding, but expressed his opinion
that the list was not being fairly gone through, and his lordship
made use of some very strong expressions in favour of number
one, when
Faulkner—on the part of the Custom House officers, showed cause,
and explained the mistake into which his lordship had fallen.
Alderson, B.-This savours of Corin. I have sat on this bench for
upwards of two hours, and I have seen all the cases that have been
looked into.
Faulkner—Your lordship will see by the paper-book (handing up
the list) that all the cases before your lordship are fairly entitled to
rank as precedents.
Alderson, B-But suppose I put myself in the position of the
remainder man; is the remainder man never to be allowed to come
in, Mr. Faulkner?
Faulkner.—Your lordship must be aware that the remainder man
cannot come in until all the searchees in possession are satisfied.
Mr. Baron Alderson said he should take time to consider, and
shortly afterwards his lordship's judgment confirmed the view taken
by Ma. FaulkNER.
OH ! THE WHITE WESTS OF YOUNG ENGLAND !
Ana.-"oh! the Roast Beef of Old England!"
On 1 the vests of Young England are perfectly white,
And they're cut very neatly and sit very tight,
And they serve to distinguish our Young Englishmen
From the juvenile MANNERs to CoNINgsby BEN :
Sing, “Oh the white vests of Young England,
And Oh! the Young English white vests 1'.'
Now the Old English vest was some two yards about,
For Old England was rather inclined to be stout :
But the Young English waist is extremely compress'd,
By the very close fit of the Young English vest.
Sing, “Oh! &c.”
The Young English white vest, upon one little score,
May perhaps be considered a bit of a bore,
For it makes the resemblance .# near
*Twixt the Young English Waiter and Young English Peer.
Sing, “Oh! &c.”
But what are the odds as concerning the vest,
So long as felicity reigns in the breast !
And Young England to wear what it pleases may claim,
Let us hope all its tailors are paid for the same.
Sing, “Oh! &c.”
- Good news for the Pensioners,
It is stated that the out-pensioners of Chelsea Hospital are to be identi-
fied every six months, and “are to be considered on a nearly similar
ºf as when they were in the service.” We shall be glad to know
how this will affect those pensioners who have lost their legs, and who
cannot be supposed to be on anything like the same footing as when they
were in the service.

CHAPTER THE ELEVENTH...-OF TITLE BY DESCENT.
ong has it been one of those beautiful maxims in which
our law is luxuriantly rich, that “what one man
loses, another gains,” but, supposing a man to lose
his senses, which he often does when he goes to law,
we should be glad to know who gains them. At all
events, it seems quite agreed that law is a matter of
gain and loss, whereof the latter decidedly prepon-
derates. The methods of acquiring on the one hand,
and losing on the other, are reduced by Coke to two,
namely, descent and purchase, though if we had been
asked to say the two methods by which property may
be legally lost, we should have at once defined them
to be Common Law and Equity.
Descent is the title by which the
estate of the ancestor is cast upon the
heir, but if the estate of the ancestor
consists of Wallsend coals it may be
very inconvenient for the heir to have
them cast by descent upon him.
Descent depends upon consanguinity,
which is either lineal or collateral, the
former being the sort of relationship that exists between old Jones
and young Jones, supposing young Jones to be the son of old Jones,<
and all the little Joneses would be lineal descendants through as many
generations as there happened to be of them. Collateral consanguinity is
the sort of relationship existing between a couple of gooseberries, growing
on different branches of the same root, as if Smith (the root) has two sons
(the branches) each of whom has a son (a gooseberry), there is a clear
collateral consanguinity existing between the young Smiths, that is to say,
the early gooseberries. Several alterations have been made in the law of
descent, which did not come into operation until the 1st of Jan. 1834;
and MR. Stewart has discovered, with his usual acuteness, that persons
who died before 1834 will not be expected to comply with the law that
came into operation after that date, an indulgence which those who died
previous to 1834 will no doubt fully appreciate.
By the old law, an estate could never ascend, or go up, but always de-
scended, and indeed even now the law rather delights in knocking property
down, for an estate goes down to the son, before it goes up to the father,
who only takes it if the owner has no son to come in for it. But by the
same law, paternal ancestors take before maternal ancestors, or, in other
words, the law never falls back upon the mother until the father is quite
exhausted. A second rule is that the law easts the estate on the male
issue before the female, which we can only account for by presuming that
the law, in its gallantry towards the ladies, is unwilling to cast upon them
anything they may not be strong enough to sustain the burden of. A
third rule is, that males shall inherit alone, and women altogether—the
latter being a cunning device of the law to get property into its own
hands, for by giving an estate to a lot of women, a quarrel amongst
them is ensured, and the estate getting into Chancery, the law has its
pickings out of it. A fourth rule is, that the lineal descendants ad infinitum
shall stand exactly in the same position as the ancestor would have done,
had he been living ; so that alſ the posterity of BARON NATHAN will be
expected to dance hornpipes among new-laid eggs, because that was fre-
quently the position in which their ancestor placed himself. A fifth rule
is, that if lineal descendants fail collaterals shall take, or to revert to the
simile of the gooseberry bush, if the root has no branches the estate shall
go to the gooseberries, “but this,” says BRActon, “is sending the estate
to old gooseberry;” a remark that could only have been made for the
sake of the joke, for there is certainly very little legal learning comprised
in it. A sixth rule is, that the brother shall shut out the uncle, a pro-
ceeding, by-the-by, that appears to be very unnephew-like. Thus, if
John STILEs has a brother, the uncle is shut out until there is a failure
of brothers; whereupon if there should be a glut of uncles, the oldest
uncle—like the oldest hand at a game of whist—is allowed to count the
family honours. The seventh and last rule is, that male stocks in colla-
teral inheritances shall be preferred to female; so that if land descends
from John STILEs, who marries Lucy BAKER, the STILESEs shall for ever
shut out the BAKERs, who, like the old woman and her pig, will not be
able to pass over the STILEs, as long as one of them remains in existence.
In former editions it has been customary to give elaborate directions
for searching for the heir of John SriLes, and it has been usual to add a
table of consanguinity, through the various ramifications of which that
illustrious person—like a needle in a bottle of hay—may be looked for.
We shall not, however, take the reader through the awful labyrinth,
pouncing at one moment upon Stiles's paternal grandfather's mother,
now .."; down after his maternal grandmother, then suddenly
emerging from the blood of the BAKERs, to wade through the collateral
consanguinity of the Whires, the Thorpes, and the Willises. No. if
Srules's heir is an object of interest to any particularly curious reader,
let him exercise his own ingenuity in searching for STILEs's heir amid the
amusing puzzle of bits of riband, squares, hexagons, octagons, demi-hex-
agons, demi-octagons, hands, lines and numbers, which in the Table of

AGE OF OUR LINE-OF-BATTLE SHIPS,
A statement under this head has been put forth for the purpose of
proving that our ships are not so very old after all ; and it appears that
half of them are not out of their teens, while very few indeed have
reached the years of discretion. The Superb, of 80 guns, turns out not
to be an old man-of-war, but a mere baby, having been launched in 1842;
while the Boscawen, 74, can hardly be said to have been weaned, having
never hoisted the pendant. In fact, the line-of-battle ships seem to
be in a state of happy infancy, and England may boast of as juvenile a
navy as she could possibly wish for.
A DAY AT A CUSTOM HOUSE.
or the fºllowing Vicissitudes of a “Day at a
Custom House,” we are indebted to the kindness
of the Custom-House Officers at Folkestone :-
You arrive very early in the morning. Your
fellow passengers eye you with distrust; though
you are 135 on the list.
The clock strikes nine. . A groan escapes
from 178 individuals in and out of the room.
The first train has gone.
No. 4 is called. An hour afterwards No. 5;
then No. 6, followed at eleven o'clock by 7
and 8, the latter consisting of a French school-
master with thirteen of his pupils, come over
on a holiday trip. Good Heavens ! It is
already twelve o'clock, and you have a wife waiting for you at the
Bricklayers' Arms, and a bill to take up at 4. -
one o'clock. —You have read the Almanack over the mantelpiece no
less than four times, eaten a basin of soup, got bitten in playing with the
old lady's parrot, and yet No. 29 has only just gone in You think of
your wife, and prepare to go to sleep. -
Half-Past One.—You wake up. Can you believe your eyes! There's
not a man, woman, or child, in the room, Don't be alarmed ! The
Custom-House Officers have only gone to their dinner, and you have
missed the second and third trains long agº. -
Quarter to Three.—Another boat has just come in. 200 passengers,
You wonder at what distant period No. 200 is likely to reach London.
Not before A.D. 1845. You suddenly determine to go in search of
lodgings.
Three o'clock.--Not a lodging—not a book—not a newspaper to be got
in the place, excepting at the Pavilion. You begin reading the “Hackney-
coach Fares,” in last year's Pocket-Book, till another train starting re-
minds you it is -
Four o'clock.—You rush recklessly into brandy and water and cigars.
Five o’Clock.-It's beginning to rain. Your great coat is in your
trunk, so you are obliged to go back again into the little cupboard of a
waiting room for shelter.
six o'clock.—A mutiny has just broken out amongst the starved-out
passengers. The complaints are heart-breaking. The door-keeper has
retreated into the next room to escape the vengeance of an old lady's
poodle, and the threats of a BARon of THE Exchequeh."
seven.—A Policeman and a copy of Punch have restored order...A
famine, however, has just attacked the 257, remaining passengers. Five
and thirty full-grown children and two babies are, screaming excru-
ciatingly with hunger. The Policeman has sent to the Pavilion for a wheel-
barrow of sandwiches. - - -
Eight.—The sandwiches be praised 1 The babies are again quiet.
Halfpast eight.—The children are asleep, the women, are putting
their hair into paper. The men every five minutes keep Pulling out their
watches. -
Nine.—No. 100 has just gone in. Hip, hip, hurrah
Ten.—Every bed in the town is booked three deep.
Eleven.—Can it be possible? Only two numbers more, and then—
Quarter to Twelve.—No. 135 ! Yes—no, pooh it cannot be—but
yes, it is—you are called ! You shake the doorkeeper by the hand, and
plunge frantically into the next room,-huddle boots, shirts, shaving tackle,

the Last on the list.
THE QUEEN IN SCOTLAND.
Sin ANDREw AGNew has written a letter to the EARL of ABERDEEN,
tlough intended as a sort of side-wind epistle to Hen Majesty. This
letter is, on the face of it, meant as a lecture to Queen VicroR1A on her
better keeping of the Sabbath. SiR ANDREw is grievously afraid that
the Queen will introduce the sinful levities of Sunday-breaking England
among the patent pious folk of sweetly austere Caledonia. He trembles
lest the Sabbath revelry of Windsor should startle and confound the
kilted proprieties of Blair Athol. Certainly, if we wanted to pick out
a man of pattern impudence, we would go neither to the court or camp,
but to the conventicle. Your self-thought saint is ever a fellow of im-
perturbable brass. One Mawworm, in such material, outweighs a hundred
Bobadils. Take an example:—
“Scotland has, since the Reformation, [says Sin ANDREw,] been distinguished
amongst the nations of Christendom as a strict Sabbath-observing country, in the true
Scriptural sense of that word; and it is this important fact which, with all imaginable
respect, and deference, and dutifulness. and loyalty, it is humbly prayed may be brought
u-der the notice. At this tims, of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen, not dowhting
that in this, as in all other respects, it is the gracious desire of the Royal mind to re.cº.
mise, to respect, and to gra’ify the religious habits, the peculiar characteristies, ºstd
the best principles of Her Majesty's most loyal and devoted subjects in this her ancient
kingdom.”
That is, Sin ANDREw, in plain English, hints that the QUEEN will behave
herself better on Sundays in Scotland than is her wont on the Sabbath-
day in England. As her Scotch subjects are in every respect a nobler,
}. more generous, and really and truly more religious people than the
nglish—in fact as, past dispute, they are the chosen vessels of all created
flesh—so should the Queen pay to them that studious observance only due
to the elect of heaven. Thus, Sir ANDREw hopes that, on the Sabbath,
the Queen will encourage no quadrille parties; that PRINCE ALBERT will
nor whistle “My heart’s in the Highlands;” and that the little Princess
will especially not play at “Beggar my Neighbour” with LAny Canoline
Cocks. It is evident that Sir ANDREw fears licence of this sort, or
why, with such tremulous sanctity, should he give warning to the Queen
The saintly baronet continues:—
“It would be the highest presumption to surgest to your Lordship's consideration
the extent of the overwhelmi moral infº which the ple of the court is cal-
eulated to produce upon the religious habits of Scotland on this auspicious occasion.”
HER Majesty's visit will extend to a few days; yet may such brief
time be fraught with mortal danger to the habits of the most moral people
on the face of the earth ! For that the Scotch are the most moral people
of the universe, who shall be bold enough to doubt, seeing that they
themselves never lose the remotest chance of declaring it ! Well, let us
hope the best for Scotland in her present Petil: but had Punch been
born north of the Tweed (think of a Scotch funch /), he would not feel
at ease for the surpassing purity of his native land until Queex WicroRua's
court was once more fast at Windsor.
The amount of nonsense from those folks “whose heads do grow"
heaven above knows where—those mysterious diurnal scribes called “Our
own Correspondents,” “Our own Reporter,” “Our own Special Reporter,”
and such like magii—has been of average quantity and quality. The
Morning Post's “special,” of course, carries the day. Hence, the “rude
hand of health,” which, according to the same authority, has its “esta-
blished dwelling-place in the hills and glens of Scotland,” (making
lodgings preposterously dear, no doubt,)—well, this rude CRIBs-like hand
of health has made very free with the Queen's complexion; “for,” says
the “special,”—and we are half-inclined to think that JENkuns has reco-
vered from his trance, and wears a kilt—for
“Her Majesty left the shores of England like a second Galatea—
“Candidiornivei folio, Galatea, ligustri;”—
but constant exposure to the weather and the fresh air, which streams through “the land
of mountain and of flood,” have substituted a healthful ruddiness for the pale cast of
thought with which her Majesty's countenance has been sicklied over,” &c. &c.
HER MAJEsry as Galatea! Well, we hope no man doubts our loyalty—
but for the moment, charmed by the picture of the special Jenkins, we could
not help associating HER MAJESTY with the Opera glories of Drury Lane I
“The Princess Royal, mounted on a Shetland pony, and attended by a groom and servant,
..º.º. her Majesty and the Prince in their morning walk through the grounds,
and the Royal parents are frequently seen to stop and listen with alternations of interest
and amusement to the nafs observations of the youthful Princess on the novelty of the
objects which meet her view at every instant.”
| How extraordinary 1 that a father and mother should be pleased and
| interested with the simple prattle (that is, with “the naifs observations")
of their own babel Is it possible that a woman, become QUEEN, can
condescend to laugh and talk with the child of her blood? Well, we only
hope that such eccentricities will not bring royalty into contempt.
We suspect there will be a great run for Gaelic masters at the West-end,
the QUEEN having become so intensely Scotch.
“Her Majesty appears to have a great taste for things peculiarly Scottish. At Dun-
keld, Moulinearn, and Blair, she tasted, and not only so, but as the report goes, highly
relished, the Athol brose which was proffered her; and oaten cake is an established and
especial favourite. ‘Scotch broth,” as Englishmen term it, is also in daily requisition at
the royal table.”
The most astounding part is to come :-
“It is even whispered that her Majesty is not altogether unacquainted with the mys-
teries of Scotch ‘haggis.” The English cooks are puzzled.”
And therefore, we are informed, HER Majesty has appointed two new
officers to her kitchen, to be called the Serjeant of Brose, and the Grand
Master of Cockaleekiel
“And then as to dress, both her Majesty and the Prince, when at the Falls of Bruar,
appeared in tartan plaids, and, but that they are now in mourning, they would, it is
said, wear tartan dresses.”
However, the PRInce has promised—when out of mourning—to wear
nothing but the kilt at Windsor. One incident, shamefully unnoticed by
the Scotch papers, shows the intense admiration of the Queen for all things
Scottish. alking to the Falls of Bruar, HER Majesty suddenly paused
—and out of compliment to the custom of the country—pulled off her
shoes and stockings, and walked an hour and more barefoot I
“The Princess Royal, young though she be, is not slow in these things tº imitate her
al mother. Not a jº. all broad Scotland likes better to lunch on milk and oaten
e, or dine on broth. Meeting the young son of Lord Glenlyon, the other day, in the
Castle avenue, she told him how much she liked his tartan dress, and how it was the
same as was worn by the Prince of Wales.”
The Princess has also refused to wear shoes and stockings, and, in imita-
tion of the peasantry, runs about the grounds of Blair Athol “bare leggit."
HER Majesty, however, has learned a new pleasure from her visit to
Scotland. She now knows what water really is ; for, according to a
Scotch paper (The Witness), she takes a copious draught from a stream
in Glen Tilt, “declaring that never in England did she taste of such a
stream I?’
HER MAJEsty will, however, have left many marks of her condescension
behind her, which will be duly prized, for we are told that-
“The good folks at the Falls (of Tummel] are delighted with the smallness of the
Royal foot. From the prints left in the sand they have measured the exact length, and
they keep the trophy as a great treasure."
Silver slippers will, we understand, be made according to the dimen-
sions of the impression. Since Robinson Crusoe started at the foot-mark
“left in the sand,” there has been no such astonishment.
The royal party are accompanied by Scotch bards who point out
different historical localities, at the same time narrating their legends.
The field in which Clavenhouse was shot, was shown to HER MAJESTr.
“According to tradition, Claverhouse was shot with a sixpence, the superstition being
that }: bore a life that was charmed against ordinary modes of attack, and a body bullet-
proof.”
This is, of course, a poetic fabrication. Shot with a sixpence Ws
should like to know who supplied the money i

PUNCH'S OWN REPORT OF THE ROYAL
PROGRESS.
Eron E resuming our report of the Royal
progress, we have one or two little
incidents to revert to, particularly the
affecting circumstance of the QUEEN
having tied on the bonnet of the
Princess-Royal at the window of the
inn ; a fact that has added ten per
cent. to her popularity. That bonnet
will give stability to her Crown, and
those strings will tie the people more
closely to the House of Brunswick.
Another source of the popularity
which Her Majesty has gained must
be looked for in the Brose, an unpala-
table concoction of barley and salt,
which the QUEEN manages to taste
wherever she goes ; and, by calling it
nice, she has tickled the vanity of the
Scotch people. PRINCE ALBERT has
patronised the toddy once or twice,
and the little Princess has been made to eat oat cake several
times—for a child will demolish any thing with the name of cake—
and the Scotch are flattered into the belief that theirs is really a treat
for the illustrious infant.
Saturday—PRINCE ALBERT rode out on a pony, and shot three
harts, facetiously observing, that three harty dinners could be made
of them. The QUEEN rode out in a pony-phaeton to see the Falls of
Bruar, but witnessed a fall of another kind in the shape of a pelting
shower, which she was informed would add greatly to the grandeur
of the scene; but as she was compelled to hold a great gig umbrella
right over her eyes, the grandeur of the scene was thrown away upon
her.
Monday.—Her MAJEsty was wheeled about in a garden-chair,
while PRINCE ALBERT went out grouse-shooting. The sport was
meagre, and, it is said, the birds were shy, but we suspect the “shy-
ness” was on the part of the PRINCE's sportsmanship. On his way
home, he bought a few brace, to prevent the Queen from quizzing
him—an innocent amusement Her MAJEsty is much addicted to.
Tuesday. — The PRINCEss-Roy AL and her nursery-governess,
MADLLE. CHAIRIER, had their usual run and romp, for half an hour,
on the grass-plot.
As it would be wearisome to continue the account of the progress
from day to day, we therefore refer the public to the daily journals,
in which events equally interesting with those related above will be
found faithfully recorded.
We ought, perhaps, not to omit a royal bon mot of more than
average brilliancy:-THE QUEEN asked PRINCE ALBERT's opinion
of Lord GLEN Lyon. “Oh 1” said the Prince, “Lon D GLENLYon
is all very well, but nothing out of the way.” “Indeed 1" replied the
Queen, “you would not have thought him nothing out of the way,
if you had been taken, as I was, a mile in the wrong direction by his
Lordship yesterday.” The PRINcE, who indulges in the same sort
of banter that the QUEEN is said, by the papers, to delight in at the
expense of the PRINcE, threatened to send the joke up to Punch.
How well his Royal Highness can keep his word, our present
number will testify.
SCENE AT A CHOP HOUSE.
A Gentleman eating his Dinner, and reading a Paper. Another enters.
2nd Gent. I'll look at that Newspaper when you have done with
it, Sir.
1st Gent. It's not a Newspaper.
2nd Gent. No What is it then
1st Gent. It's the Morning Herald.
2nd Gent. Oh !—then I won't trouble you.
A Disloyal Dog.
We have often heard of the sagacity of the canine species, but we don't
know what to say to the ill-mannered hound, who while on his way to be
presented to PRINCE ALBERT, slipped away from the person who had the
charge of him. Perhaps the creature was shy and felt nervous at the
idea of being expected to make his bow-wow in the presence of royalty.
LOUIS PHILIPPE'S VISIT TO “PERFIDIOUS
ALBION.”
It is by this time pretty well known to the whole universe that
the King of the French has no great claim upon the good offices of
Punch; seeing that, wherever Punch shews his nose in France, he is
immediately impounded by the police ; that he is stopped at the Post-
office—seized at the Custom House—not permitted even to be at the
table of any steam-boat in any French port. But doth this foolish-
ness of the King of the French move the wrath of Punch 2 Certainly
not—nothing but his pity; he can look philosophically around him,
and pardon French injustice : more, he can give good advice to
Louis PHILIPPE—a fact made manifest by the subjoined epistles.
From the King of the French to Punch.
Neuilly, Sept. 17, 1844.
MR. Punch,-Whatever differences may have passed between us, I
have too much faith in your wisdom and generosity to believe that you
will deny me your counsel in my present perplexity. -
I have been invited to England. Now, Sir, do you think it safe for me to
come Do you believe that, after all the hard words, all the fanfaronnade
of my Paris press, that I shall be decently received by the people of
England Shall I be mobbed or huzzaed ; Covered with roses or eggs?
I am induced to put this question from a thorough belief that if QUEEN
Victoria were just now to come to Paris, that a French mob would not,
by their reception of her, prove themselves the most civilised people of the
earth. Sure I am that her ears would be assailed with “a basles Anglais”
—“Pritchard”—“Albion perfide,” and other choice epithets current in
the French papers.
To whom, then, in my difficulty can I so well apply as to you, Mr.
Punch ; you, who know so well the heart of perfid— that is, of generous
Albion. Pray, then, drop me a line—let me know if I may with safety
venture among you, and (despite our quarrels)
Believe me, your sincere friend,
Louis Philippe.
From Punch to the King of the French.
SIRE,--I thought your long experience of Englishmen had taught you
better. What have you forgotten the sweet days of retirement when,
freed from the ceremony of a palace, you lived a philosophic exile in a two-
pair back, Tottenham-court-road Î Can you, then, for a moment, doubt
the kind of reception you will have of us?
Fear not, Sire but come. We shall treat you with respect—with hospi-
tality. We leave it to “the sons of glory,” to “jeune France,” to insult
the stranger in their streets by foul words and braggadocio gestures—yes,
we leave it to “the most civilised nation of the earth” to make mouths and
deal in foul words towards the foreigner who, in the security of peace,
trusts himself to national hospitality and—finds it not.
I remain, your obedient servant,
33&H$2CH2.
When you come, I shall be happy to show you the lions.
SNAILS ON RIBANDS.
In one of the excursions of the Archaeologists, DR. Buckland paused
at some snails. He gave, says the Athenaeum–
“A striking illustration of the strong acid of these snails, ºf one for a short
time on the lilac riband of a lady’s bonnet. The young lady did not seem displeased
with the test, with its success, or the scissors of the operator reducing the riband of her
bonnet; but when Da. Buckland requested her signature in attestation of the truth of
his statement, the lady declined the honour.”
This is an error. The young lady wrote the following document —
“I hereby attest that Dr. Buckland, with his nasty salts of snails, has entirely spoilt
my love of a lilac riband; and 1 furthermore declare it to be my opinion that the said
Dit. Buckland, if he be a gentleman, will behave himself as such, and immediately
present me with a new one.”
Martyr Promises.
The present MR. GRattan—who bears about the same relative value tº
his great father as the potato apple bears to the potato—has promised
Ireland “never to have a quiet mind or a peaceful sleep” until repeal
shall be obtained 1 MR. STEELE has also promised Ireland never to sneeze
until his country shall be free ; whilst it is whispered that FATHER
Maguine has vowed “never again to open his lips' until that glorious.
consummation I This last report, however, is too good to be true'

PUNCH*S GUIDE TO STATE SERVICE.
The following suggestion, it is hoped, will prove useful to the servants whom
they concern:— -
1. The PREMIER.
No particular person is more qualified than another to be Premier ; indeed, a
Premier must not be particular. The Premier's place is to superintend the other
state servants, and see that they do their work ; but he has no occasion to trouble
himself about this till complaints are made. He has also to propose new laws, or
alter old ones ; but he should wait, before he does either, till the country is on the
eve of insurrection.
His chief business in Parliament is, to resist all improvements as long as he
can ; to which end he must possess great strength of lungs, to out-talk those who
call for them. He should be able to speak, standing, for three hours at a time,
either without saying anything tangible, or only to the effect of misleading his
hearers. He will find an active imagination useful, therefrom to derive his facts.
He should know how to answer an argument with a joke, so as to turn the tables
when in a corner. He may as well be provided with a few classical quotations,
for use on occasion : he will find plenty in the Eton Grammar. He must be able
to take all sorts of abuse with indifference; and bear to be hooted and even pelted,
now and then, with equanimity. He must be ready to say and unsay without the
slightest scruple, and to change his opinions as often as he may find it expedient.
2. The Home-Secret ARY.
The Home-Secretary is an under-servant to the Premier. He has to regulate
*ien little matters as prison discipline, workhouse regulations, and the appointment

assimilate them as closely as possible; and in the latter he should
be guided by his political prejudices. He also presides over
the Post-office; and when he has nothing else to do there,
may employ his leisure in opening the letters that pass through
it. He is likewise employed, subject to the approval of his prin-
cipal, in introducing new laws of a certain sort, such as Medical
Reform ; but it does not seem at all necessary that he should
understand one iota of the subject on which he legislates.
THE SONG OF THE LIBERATED.
AIR-"The Groves of Blarney.”
“Och sons of praties—I know how great is
Your joy to see me resume my sate;
Did DAN not tell yez—ye loyal-rebellious,
He'd bother Justice and bilk the State 1
Such pleasant quarters they gave us “martyrs,"
That some of my friends felt inclin'd to stay,
Else 'twas not in natur, that a Liberator
So long should dwell under lock and kay.
I knew 'twas in yez—to find the “sinews
Of war,”—so long as in “quod.” I’d lie,
And DANIEL junior, he, in matterspecuniary
Is almost as taking and 'cute as I.
And thus relyin', on him and O'BRIEN,
At Richmond long I could love to stay,
Wid princely diet, and peace and quiet,
And “sympathisers” and extra pay.
A monster meeting—ye'll be entreating,
To yell in pride, through an idle day,
But I'll make a “preachment,” about “impeachment,”
And turn your heads on a smoother way.
Yez must not jostle your great apostle,
Wid ill-timed shoves, to the battle's van,
But wide mouths opening, wid closed eyes groping,

FIROM A LADY IN WANT of A Governess,
TO AN ACQUAINTANCE,
Nº ſ: DEAR MADAM,
ſ We are again in tribulation; for
ſ #. Miss SincLain, the young person whose
ſº -5 harp-playing you were pleased to admire,
- has left us—left us, too, in the most shame-
ful and ungrateful manner, before we could
provide another teacher for the dear children.
Oh, these governesses I am told there is some clever gentleman who
has invented an arithmetical machine that will calculate any sum to
a fraction. What a blessing would that man bestow upon really good
society who should invent an instrument for teaching! I am sure, in
these days, the thing might be done, and would pay admirably; for
how much annoyance would be spared us—how much impertinence
that we are daily exposed to from a class of individuals who can have
ro standing in society, and are nevertheless continually at one's
elbow ! The cook, the housemaid, the lady's-maid, all know their
place, and behave themselves accordingly: but there is no teaching
a governess that she is nothing more than a servant; a person hired
for wages to polish the minds of your children just in the same
manner as Molly polishes your rosewood and mahogany—and to be
as careful of their morals as if, like the housekeeper, she was entrusted
with so much precious china. Your maid dresses your hair with due
humility, and takes your little bits of ill-temper with proper resigna-
tion; she knows these things are considered in her wages, and thus
she may be an ornament to the sphere to which it has pleased
IIeaven to call her. But governesses they are continually flying in
the face of Providence 1 There is, too, an impertinence in their very
meekness; at times, an insult in their silence. They move about
you with the air of injured beings—an air that says to your very face
—“We, too, are ladies, though you can’t believe it.” Ladies i as if
the person who takes a salary is not, to all intents and purposes, a
servant—at best, a better sort of menial servant.
To return to that person Si Nclain. I never liked her from the
first; but as I heard that she had an old father to provide for—the
inan was, I believe, in gaol at the time—I suffered my charity to
cover a multitude of her faults, and received her, as she was after-
wards pleased to call it, into my family,–into one of my back bed-
rooms would have been a more respectful phrase. Well, she would
always be reading, when she ought to have talked to and amused the
dear children. It was only yesterday that she repeated the fault.
She had been out three or four hours walking, and I found her again
reading a book, whilst the dear things were moped to death for
something to enliven them. My indignation was roused, and I asked
her if she thought she was acting honestly by her employer She
looked up at me—her face turned blood-red—her lips quivered with
some impertinent reply, I am certain, by their motion—and then
dropping the book, she burst into tears. Governesses, my dear
Madam, always can. But I have not told you all. What book, think
you, was it? A Christmas Carol. I have never read the thing; but
knowing it to be aimed at the best interests of good society, all the
feelings of a mother rushed upon me, and I believe I did read her a
pretty lesson. You hav'n't heard all. Whilst I was reproaching her
WoL. V. I.-1844.
for her ingratitude, her baseness in bringing such books into my
family, and saying something, I forget exactly what, about a viper 1
had warmed—she sprang from the chair like a play-house queen, and
in a voice as searching as an east wind–told me that she would
leave my house that instant 1 Her impudence—for I knew she must
go to starvation—fairly took away my breath. Well, it isn't all told.
She multiplied her insults, for with her wet, streaming face, she
caught little EMMELINE about the neck, and kissing her violently,
cried “God bless the children : " I trust I am not unforgiving; no :
but there was an emphasis upon “the children” that nothing would
ever make me pardon. It was a refinement of abuse that made me
quiver again. However, I had my satisfaction of my lady; for I
would not suffer a servant to stir—no, I made her call a hackney-
coach herself to take her boxes; though after the sort of book I
caught her with, I certainly ought to have well rummaged them
before they left the house.
Can you recommend me another governess—for although I have
been but a day unprovided, I feel worn to death by the children
What's worse—but then she’s only a child—EMMELINE has been
crying all day about the creature, and moreover says she loves her.
The principles she might have instilled into the dear babe's mind i
shudder to think of . However, we are happily rid of her. If you can
recommend me a really useful, well-behaved person—you know the
kind of individual I want—you will confer a favour on
Yours obliged,
Hononia Asphalt.
P.S.. I hav'n't told you all my troubles. We are about to lose our
treasure of a cook. Sin John and he have had some words about
the soup—the man feels his reputation wounded, and has resigned.
I have myself tried to pacify him, but as yet without success. I have
scolded Sun John well for his indiscretion towards so valuable a
chef. I am, however, going out, and shall see if a nice diamond ring
will restore peace; if so, fifty or seventy pounds will be well
bestowed.
LETTER XXVIII.
The ANSWER.
DEAR MADAM,
Whilst I sympathise with you, I must also use the privilege
of a friend, and admonish. The truth is—and, though truth, like
medicine, is generally unpleasant, it must nevertheless, like medicine,
be sometimes administered—the truth is, you spoil all your gover-
nesses. You do, indeed. I, who have had a large experience of
that sort of people, know it. Only a week ago, I saw Sinclaim in
the Park, talking with another governess.
liberty of asking her who she was She replied—I thought very
boldly—an old schoolfellow. Upon which I told her you would be
very angry if you knew of the indiscretion. That, as a governess,
she had no longer anything to do with schoolfellows, and should
speak to nobody but to the young ladies. That it was her duty, as a
young woman of principle—and I dwelt, as you know I can dwell,
upon the word—upon principle, to cut herself off from the rest of
the world, and study nobody but you and the dear children. My
idea of a good governess, I observed, is, that she should be a sort of
nun engaged upon wages; a person vowed to humility, gentleness,
and resignation, for so much salary. That she should usix in the
world as though she were no part of it—self-removed from its plea-
sures and its sympathies; in fact, as a sort of machine ordained by
Providence to await the behests of those ordained above her. Upon
this, she dropt her eyelids, I thought, very insolently, and, with a
smile not to be inistaken, turned away. Never, my dear madam, let
your governess talk with another governess. Depend upon it, their
conversation is always about their employers; and such is the un-
grateful spirit of the people, I fear me always to their detriment.
Besides, I have known the scarlet fever brought into a house by
such a practice.
You will also pardon me, when I tell you that you are not suffi-
ciently discreet as to the age of your governesses. Monnis, I
remember, who preceded Sinclaim, must at least have been seven-
and-thirty ; whilst Sinclain cannot have been more than one-and-
twenty. Now, a governess should never be chosen younger than
five-and-twenty, or older than five-and-thirty. The intermediate
time may be called the prime of governess life. If you get them
younger, their heads are full of most preposterous notions about
affections, and sympathies, and what they call yearnings for home.
Like unweaned lambs, they are always bleating and unsatisfied. At

As your friend, I took the .

five-and-twenty, the governess-mind knows better what is due to
itself and employer, and with a strong hand plucks up such weak-
nesses as unprofitable weeds; at least, if it doesn't, it ought. After
five-and-thirty, the governess gets slow and prosy, and her heaviness
may dangerously infect the light-heartedness of the dear children —
therefore, she is not to be thought of an hour longer. Immediately
supply her place with a junior teacher, as you value the morals
and accomplishments of your beloved family. -
If, in the course of ten years, with a salary of, let us say, twenty
pounds a-year, out of which she has only to buy clothes fit to keep
company with the children, the governess has not saved a sufficiency
for her declining age—it is but too painful to know that she must
have been a very profuse, improvident person. And yet, I fear me,
there are lamentable instances of such indiscretion. I myself, at
this moment, know a spendthrift creature who, as I have heard, in
her prime—that is, for the ten years—lived in one family. Two of
her pupils are now countesses. Well, she had saved next to no-
thing, and when discharged, she sank lower and lower as a daily
governess, and at length absolutely taught French, Italian, and the
harp to the daughters of small tradesmen, at eighteen-pence a lesson.
In time, she of course got too old for this. She now lives somewhere
at Camberwell, and, though sand-blind, keeps a sixpenny school for
little boys and girls of the lower orders. With this, and the profits
on her cakes, she contrives to eke out a miserable existence—a sad
example, if they would only be warned, to improvident governesses.
"I am now called away, and am therefore unable to answer your
letter to the full. However, you shall have another epistle on the
subject to-morrow."
Yours always,
DoRo THEA. Flint.
MEDITATIONS ON MR. BARRY'S NEW Houses OF
PARLIAMENT.
Written on board the Lily Steam-Boat.
THE wharf-bell tolls the knell of starting steam,
The #. crowd pours quickly o'er the pier;
The ladies forward rush with .# scream,
And leave the stern to Punch and bottled beer.
Now fades each public building from the sight,
As on her course the Lily steamer holds,
Till new St. Stephen's rears its moderate height,
Which many a tier of scaffolding infolds.
Beneath those beams; those yet unfinished towers,
At present echoing with the workmen's clang;
Upon their legs, perchance, for weary hours,
Shall Britain's future Senators harangue.
Full many a Whig of coldest heart serene,
Shall broach his philosophic nonsense there;
Full many a Tory, born abuse to screen,
Shall waste his humbug on the midnight air.
Some future Duncombe, there, with dauntless breast,
The tyrant of his diocese shall twit;
Some mute, good-humoured BROUGHAM contented rest—
Some Sibthorp, guiltless of his country's wit.
Mourn not the Houses burnt some years ago;
No vain regrets the ruin'd pile requires.
Ev’n from its dust a voice exclaims “Oh Oh!
Even in our ashes live their wonted fires.”
ERRATUM.
The Post’s “special” reporter at Blair Athol, writing of Lond GLEN-
Lyon's little boy, says that, “his eyes glitter as with morning dew.” This
is an error of the printer. For “morning dew," it should have been
“ mountain dew.” The whole tenor of the article shows what was in the
writer's brain.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Ghost of Whittington to Michael Gibbs,
Citizen AND Fish Mongrk.
From the Shades, Sept. 30, 1844.
Y EXPRESS.—We have just read it in the
Morning Herald that thou, Michael, alder-
man—churchwarden—salt-water treasurer
—inspector of the sewers, with many et
ceteras—art chosen Lord Mayor of glorious
London. The thing is not credible, Michael.
We believe it not—and for two reasons. The
first is, that it is so put down in the Morning
Herald, which as a punishment for our mortal
sins, is the only gazette permitted in these
dreary regions. Verily, for the commer-
cial reputation—for the honoured name of
the city—we are prone to denounce the story
as scandalous and wicked; a naughty fiction
to cast shame upon the Court of Aldermen.
No, Michael : thou mayest be citizen and
fishmonger—(the folk of Walbrook say skinner, too)—but thou art
not, never canst be, chosen Mayor. When the Guildhall cook shall
trust his custards to the keeping of the Guildhall cat—then shalt
thou be trusted with the authoritative mace—the glorifying chain
London's Mayor should be cunning in arithmetic. Alackſ therein
forlorn is thy ignorance. Thou wouldst have to count hob-nails at
Westminster—thou, who wilt count nothing, though sorely pressed, ir
Walbrook. Venerable are those hob-nails; yea, in them is the very
Palladium of the city. Yet, once in thy hands, who shall make
thee render them? When thou hast come down upon the mail as
churchwarden, it may then be seasonable to reckon nails as Mayor.
The merchants and traders of London were wont to have a golden
name for honour—for men of righteous dealings. Their books of
trust were open as their hearts. Their reputation, even among the
heathen, was lustrous as a star. The word of an English merchant
was more precious than ingots. And can these men have chosen
Michael Gibbs Lord Mayor Say it not to Gog and MAGoa, or even
they will blush redder through their paint.
Michael GIRBs, Lord Mayor 1 Walbrook's stiff-necked and
unrelenting churchwarden for one year the master of the City
Palace Sole despot on London's thronet Grand depositary of the
city plate 1 Alas, the twelvemonth over, who shall say that the
“loving cup” may not be fast in the gripe of litigation—that Chan-
cery, with its thousand hands, may not clutch the city spoons?
Once on the civic throne, who shall make thee descend from it?
Mayest thou not grow there—become, to the amazement and despair
of all, the Great Immoveable With thy instinctive adhesiveness to
place and profit, mayest thou not—infelix Michael 1–sit and for ever
sit the Lord Mayor Tyrant of all future years? SIRTHoMAs GREshAM,

from the Exchange, and to mark the sad, unprofitable twelvemonth,

If it, indeed, be true that in punishment of the grievous sins of the
city, thou—Michael Gibbs—art really London's Mayor, what a
pageant will there be on the coming ninth of November 1
For that day, at least, we shall visit thee! I shall again walk in
the procession,-every city ghost of us carrying a banner, or some-
what typical of the virtues of Michael Gibbs, Lord Mayor 1 Mr.

self a great treat on that festival.

English merchant glorious, will throng Fleet Street, Ludgate, and

mists of gray November—and one by one make faces at thy Mayoralty.

Qi Haº, “” hence, the 28th of September, 1844,
N j * ought to be marked down as a day of fasting
and humiliation in the Civic Calendar.
Gibbs has been elected Mayor—a result
that, like the funds of St. Stephen's, Wal-
brook, there appears to be no accounting
for. An immense dab of black ink has been
spilt smack in the centre of the civic
scutcheon. There is a blot on the City
arms, which the most succulent of pads
can never absorb. Time, alone, which
administers the salts of lemon of oblivion
to the stained canvas of history, may per-
haps mollify, but never can wholly expunge
the spot, which is as dark as if myriads of
office inkstands had poured their atrabilious
contents on the Cockney annals.
But this current of lamentation must be checked ; the mourner must
be sunk in the man ; and the plaintive philosopher must leave to the
penny-a-liner the office of detailing the facts of this deep humiliation for
the City of London.
The GREAT PLAGUE OF LONDON.
The papers announce that the King of Prussia has just created a new
branch of administration, under the title of the “MINISTRY of GRIEvances,”
the object of which is to pay special attention to such complaints as the
citizens may make against public functionaries. If a similar institution
existed in England, ALDERMAN Gibbs (the Lord Mayor elect) would
certainly be requested to accept the Civic Chiltern Hundreds.

152 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE THEATRES.
HE Season has begun . Again do play-bill posters
give life to dead walls—again does the neighbour-
hood of Drury Lane begin to feel “music's pulse in all
its arteries”—again does the courteous Mn. Anchen
sit invitingly at the Haymarket Box-Office from ten
till four—and MADAME CELEstE, having taken “more
removed ground,” for the first time opens the cleansed
and ventilated Adelphi. The theme, however, is too
serious to be lightly touched upon. Let us address
ourselves to it—for Punch, hear it ye green-rooms:
purposes to be critical this season—with respectful
gravity.
An entirely new portico, under the conscientious
direction of MR. BuNN, has been given to Drury Lane.
We present the reader with a faithful representation
of the architectural novelty. Shakspere has been
removed. We have ALFRED Bunn, vice WiLLIAM
Shakspere, promoted to Sadler's Wells. This is only
as it should be. We have, however, one fault to find
with the Bunn statue—it is all white plaster. Now,
when we remember those ebon velvet breeches, we
would have had, at least, half of Bunn, like the Prince
in the fairy tale, of black marble. However, let us
not be fastidious. The dancing figures are very taste-
fully disposed, and touchingly insinuate what support
the manager expects from ballet.
In music, MR. BuNN will be powerful as Amphion
and like him, will, we trust, make houses by the magic
of cat-gut. Some of the singers engaged are of bril-
liant reputation. We have Duprez, ANNATHILLon,
Romer, and the cordial and melodious RAINFonth.
There are, however, two timid neophytes, of whom
music-masters speak highly, and for whom—upon our
bended knee—we pray for a fostering indulgence. We
allude to a MR. John HARLEY, advertised as buffo 1
He is, we believe, not wholly new to the stage, and
has a voice of extraordinary compass, reaching we
know not to how many notes, a week. During the
recess, he has been wholly fed upon the eggs of night-
ingales and lark-pudding. Therefore, what he will do
as a buffo, nobody can tell
The second vocalist—he has not yet been announced
as such—is MR. John Cooper, who, one morning, in
the intervals of shaving, discovered that he had a very
promising baritone: This latent faculty has been
most delicately cultivated, and promises to come up
very strong in the spring. That the new-found trea-
sure may not be injured, a Doctor of Music is in
constant attendance upon MR. Coopea; not per-
mitting him to run the slightest risk of draught.
Nay, he is even not allowed to sit upon any chair,
unless duly aired.
MR. BuNN has, for what he purposes to do, an ex-
cellent company, and we heartily wish him all success.
Whilst the drama was bound hand and foot in the two
patent theatres, we fought lustily against the injus-
tice; but now, that Shakspere may, without let ºr
hindrance, wander to Islington—may, poor fellow !
whilst he is even permitted to be worried at the Vic-
toria—we have only to commend MR. BuNN or any
other manager who offers the town such entertainment
as the programme for the season promises. There-
fore, may good-luck rosin his bow, and—strike up
fiddlers :
The Haymarket throws open its doors to comedy
and farce, and has a company to do them justice.
VANE Rugh, with his silver-lace newly cleaned, has
already made his bow. At this time, especially, we
welcome these revivals. Audiences, nay Haymarket
audiences, have had in their time so many pieces with-
out either characters or words, that it is well they
should now and then go to school to the old masters.
However, for a timelet Thalia tear her hair, and chant

MR. Caixge, being desirous of falling in with the prevailing taste for
nirect communication, has made arrangements for cutting through
the inconvenient Isthmus of Professional Etiquette, which divides the
client from his counsel; and undertakes to do business without the inter-
vention of the Attorney, or Middle-man.
CRINGR begs leave to call the attention of the Felonry, his Friends,
and Patrons, to the great advantage to be derived from personal inter-
views with the Barrister, which CRinge is quite willing to grant, even to
those in the humblest or lowest stage of delinquency.
CRINGE may be consulted personally in any of the prison passages; and
he will be happy to receive Acquitted Thieves—who are desirous of
paying the residue of the fee—in the Vestibule, near the Robing-room.
CRisge begs leave to call the attention of the Guilty to the important
fact, that only a small deposit is taken on delivery of the brief, the re-

BRITISH ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT
OF SCIENCE.
(From our own Reporter.)
His Association having met at York,
Science is, of course, being advanced
in that favoured city, and such is the
determination of some of the more
active members to keep science on the
move, that they have resolved on push-
ing it to the very last extremities.
Science has taken a very considerable
round in the hands of this very able
body, and we should not be astonished
to hear of its eventually going to Jericho.
What will become of š. British, &c.
for the advancement, &c., it is not our
business to inquire. What the British,
&c. &c. &c. &c. is actually about at the
present moment, is the point to which we shall confine ourselves. The
Committee having met, Colonel SABINE–no relation, we believe, to
the historical Sabines—came forward to read the report in his character
of General Secretary. It is worth while to observe that the Association
for the Advancement of Science has advanced the Secretary, by making
a Colonel into a General—for General Secretary is the title which the
Colonel goes by in his connection with the Brit. Ass. as the sapient body
occasionally calls itself.
Colonel-General.Secretary SABINE, having cleared his throat, and sent
for his spectacles from the President of the Optical Section, who had
borrowed them in order to try some experiments in reading books,
Colonel-General-Secretary SABINE, having, in a style worthy of the Archi-
tectural Section, placed his glasses on the bridge of his nose, began to read
the report, of which the following is a summary :—
“Your Committee have great pleasure in stating that they have tried
an experiment with a captive balloon 72
Here the Secretary was interrupted by a new member inquiring what
was meant by a captive balloon. Was it a balloon that had caught on
the railings of a house, as MR. HAMPton's generally did or was it a
balloon seized and become captive on account of the damage done by its
descent, which happened occasionally to MRs. GRAHAM and other intrepid
aeronauts.
Colonel SABINE having paused for some time, and having looked out
the words “captive” and “balloon” in Johnson's Dictionary, replied,
that he could not answer the question. He would, however, refer it to the
Lexicographical Section, if the honourable members desired it.
The report was then proceeded with.
“Your Committee having had some maps, have drawn some lines,
showing some good spots for some canals, some Artesian wells, and some
other advantages.”
The new member inquired whether the lines did not disfigure the maps.
Colonel Sabine. Rather.
New Member. Then cui bono 2
The President here interfered. “If,” said he with much warmth,
“the Association is to have the cui bono test applied to its proceedings—
if we are to be asked what is the good of this or that, we may as well
dissolve the body.”—(Much cheering.)
Colonel Sabine then proceeded :—“Your Committee have sent out
Professor Forbes with a dredging machine.”
New Member. A what?
Colonel Sabine (continuing), “A dredging machine for the ose of
dredging the Ægean Sea.” ) ging purp
New Member. Oh that’s too rich—ha, ha, ha!
The President. The honourable member is right. It was the richness
of the AEgean Sea that induced this Association to dredge it. Go on, Mr.
Secretary; what does the report say as to the result of the dredging
Colonel Sabine (reading). “Your Committee feel much ecstasy in stating
that Professor Forbes has dredged
up several buckets of mixed stuff,
which have been laid before the Analytic
Section, and found to contain 150 species
of animals, all new to Science.
New Member. 150 animals 1
have their names.
The President (interfering). We should
be glad to afford every information, but
these interruptions are improper.
New Member. Well. Let's have a
few of the names of the 150 animals all
new to science.
The President. Well—I don't know !
Suppose we say, the Cockleius Scollopoe-
culus, or Cockle good for scolloping—
That’s one ! I can't think of any more
just now. Pray go on with the report,
Colonel SABINE.
Colonel Sabine (winking at the Pre-
sident). “Your Committee wished the
Government to publish the result of this
dredging; and Sir Robert Peel agreed
to print 500 copies, if there were any
means of getting rid of them. One
hundred were at once carried away by a celebrated professor.
New Member. What became of the remainder ;
The President. That's an unfair question. I don't know.
A Clerk. The cheesemonger
Colonel Sabine and the President (very vehemently to the Clerk).
Silence, sir, silence 1 You are stepping far beyond your duty, sir. Hold
your tongue, sir!
Colonel Sabine (continuing to read). “Your Committee have received
1,000l. from the Treasury for the publication of Lalande's Catalogue of
the Stars.”
New Member. What a rum catalogue.

Colonel Sabine (stuffing his pocket-handkerchief into his mouth, and
coughing.) Shall I go on with the report, or not

all away.”
New Member. All !
Colonel Sabine. Every one. They were of no use to us.
New Member. What did they cost
The President. That question must be referred to the mathematical
section.
New Member. Yes! But which is the paying section 1 (Loud cries of
“Indecent l” amidst which the New Member sat down.)
Colonel Sabine. “Your Committee beg to say in conclusion, they have
got several invitations for next year, and amongst others Cambridge
was anxious for the honour of taking them in—and doing for them "
The report having been read, a warm discussion took place on a Daddy
Longlegs, the point of dispute being whether the Daddy should be referred
to the zoological section, or whether an ethnological sub-section should be
formed for the purpose of placing the Longlegs in the hands of a separate
committee. It was ultimately agreed to look upon the Daddy Longlegs as
a subject for the zoological section at present. The meeting then broke up.
Friday.—The business to-day was quite of an abstract nature. In
Section A., Professor LoNg read a paper on infinite series, &c., or series
without end ; in illustration of which he read some observations, which
seemed as if they never would end, and even when concluded, no end
was come to.
Section B. Mr. West read a paper on mineral waters, founded on
experiments with a bottle of soda water.
Mr. HUNT read a paper on the influence of light on plants, which he
proved to be deleterious. He had held a buttercup over a lighted candle,
and, though the buttercup was not melted, the flower was considerably
damaged.
DR. BABINEUR read a paper on the mode of detecting the adulterations
in tobacco. He had smoked several penny Cubas, and detected adultera-
tion in every one of them.
Professon Forbes and MR. HEListon jointly read a paper on the
tertiary formations of the Isle of Wight. As they both read at once, it
was to us the most interesting paper we had heard at the meeting.
Section E.-MEDICAL SciENce.—DR. HeMING described a peculiar
disease of the tongue, attended with great constitutional disturbance. It
was found a good deal among Radical members of Parliament and Chartist
demagogues. The tongue was generally very bad in these cases, but th
constitutional disturbance generally insignificant,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAR1.
THE CIVIC CHAIR.
he Civic Chair really threatens to be the source
of almost as much fuss as used to be
made in the time of our Richand THE
Thirds and our Johns about the throne
of England. What with the rightful
heirs and the wrongful heirs—what with
YWood, the claimant by succession—
what with Gibbs, the pretender—and
MAGNAY, the usurper—there is no know-
ing what will eventually become of the
Cockney Sovereignty. The only thing
that we can suggest is, to put the civic
chair—as is sometimes done with the
Great Seal—into commission. Punch
would be happy to act as one of the
commissioners, and he is quite sure that
the mayoral dignity would lose nothing
in his keeping. When the heir to the throne is in his minority, it is usual
to appoint a regent; and, surely, the same course ought to be followed
with respect to the sovereignty of the city, when the aldermen next in
succession have not arrived at years of discretion.
[We had written thus far, when we received the astounding intelligence
that Gibbs was elected Mayor As the Mansion House requires a
twelvemonth's cleansing, the civic authorities now will know what to do
with the City Compter.]
AMENDE HONORABLE
The Chaplain of H.M.S. Warspite, having been reprimanded by the
Admiralty for his indiscretion in criticising the PRINCE de Joinville's
tactics at Tangier, avails himself of the indulgence of Punch to publish
the following apology to His Royal Highness:–
“The Chaplain of H.M.S. Warspite presents his compliments to His
Royal Highness the PRINCE DE Joinville, and begs hereby to apologise
to #. Royal Highness for having, in a letter to the Times, described His
Royal Highness's seamanship, as displayed at Tangier, as lubberly.
*The fact is, that the Chaplain was only joking, which, he feels, was not
perhaps quite correct, the gravity of his profession considered. . When
he insinuated that the PRINCE was a lubber, what he meant was just the
reverse; as a man does when he calls his friend a rogue or a dog. By
“lubber” he meant heart of oak, tight sailor, smart officer, naval hero.
However, he feels that his joke must have been a poor one, since he is
obliged to explain it; for the PRINCE DE Joinville, no doubt, understands
a joke as well as he does his own profession. Indeed, the PRInce's idea
of a steam-invasion of England was a capital joke.
“The chaplain of the Warspite takes this opportunity of assuring the
Paince de Joinville that he entertains the highest respect for the
French character, which he greatly admires on account of the absence of
pride, vanity, petulance, and childishness, which it displays. And so far
from intending any insult to the tricolore, he has no hesitation in saying
that he considers it equal in every respect to
“The flag that braved a thousand years,
The battle and the breeze.”
In conclusion, he will only observe, with regard to the Prince personally,
that he looks upon him as a regular out-and-out thorough-going Jack tar;
and has no doubt that he fries watches, lights his pipe with bank-notes,
chews pig-tail, hitches up his trousers, cries “Avast !” (in French), does
the cut and double shuffle, and sustains the part, in every other respect,
quite as well as MR. T. P. Cooke.”

THE REPEAL CHESTNUT.
What a modest man is MR. DANIEl O'Connell In the matter of

follow in the ranks—his heart will beat with raptures not to be expressed,

“I say that the man is not honest who does not wish to see Grey Porter at the head
of this national struggle (Cheers). As for myself. I do not want to be a teader. I am
willing to work in the team, and I will cheerfully resign to Grey Porter the reins and
guidance of the whole (Loud Cheers).”
One moment, good MR. GREY Porter, one moment only, whilst we
tell you an old, º story. Once upon a time there were some chestnuts
- call them Repeal chestnuts if you will—roasting on the hearth. An
old monkey, grown wrinkled in his tricks, watched the smoking nuts, and
longed, and longed to get one of them. But then the monkey was a cunning
old creature, and cared not to risk the burning of his fingers. A cat,
ust out of kittenhood, lay upon the hearth, purring and unsuspicious.
hereupon the monkey seized hold of the cat's paw, and boldly thrusting
it into the fire, sought thereby to take out a chestnut.
MR. Guky PontRR, that monkey's name was DAN 1
“SPORTING” At BLAIR ATHOL.
The Herald's “own correspondent” sends the following story
which, for sundry reasons, we cannot readily believe:–
“On Wednesday afternoon His Royal Highness had a wild stag brought into the
Home Park, immediately behind the castle, and shot it for the amusement of the Queen,
who was looking out of one of the back windows. The stag had on two previous nights
disturbed the inmates of the castle by its cries.”
We cannot believe that our gentle, tender-hearted Qurex, could
receive amusement from such a mere piece of butcher's-work. No :
in our mind Her Majesty is associated with that lovely picture of
womanly tenderness, bequeathed to us by magnificent old Chauces :
“She was so charitable and pitous
She wolde wepe if that she saw a mous
Caught in a trap, if it were ded or bledde.
Of smale houndes hadde she, that she fedde
. With rosted flesh, and milk, and wastel breds
But sore wept she if on of hem were dede,
Or if men smote it with a yerde smert:
And all was conscience and tendre herte / "
The correspondent goes on to write, “That it was intended that
the affair should be something of a coup de théâtre,” but Lond GLEx-
Lyon and some of the party were out of the way. Otherwise, when
the stag fell beneath ALBERT's bullet, they would doubtless have
struck up—“This day a stag must die!” We say it—we suspect the
truth of the story that the animal was thus ignominiously shot for
the amusement of Her Majesty. Certain we are that Phince
ALBERT does not grudge Mn. Giblett, of Bond Street, his
honours; sure we are that His Royal Highness has no wish to add
to his other titles that of “Butcher to the Queen 1"
EVENING THEATRICAL COSTUME.
MR. John Cooper has advertised “that no one can, on any account,
be admitted in future either to the dress circle or the stalls of Drury
lane, unless in evening costume.” MR. Coopek has likewise, in the
kindest manner, presented to us his notion of
Evening pauny-LANE costume,
revised and approved by MR. Planché. It consists of an “elegant

ROYAL SPORT.
It will be in the recollection of our readers that a handsome rod (which
turns out to be really a fishing-rod after º was a little while ago
presented to the Prince of WALEs. His Royal Highness has lately had
some capital sport with this rod, having succeeded in capturing several of
his Mamma's gold fish, one of which was as big as a dace and weighed
six ounces. It was very nearly pulling the Prince in.
PETER THE GREAT.
SIR PETER LAURIE is a great man—a very great man He had
! already shown a hundred civic proofs of his greatness, when, only
a few days since, he exhibited proof a hundred and one. Fiat experi.
mentum in rili corpore t . Therefore, what a fine thing it is that there
should be desperate, life-weary wretches to prove the moral value of
an Alderman. A cat, a rat, a mouse may, by its agonies, beautifully
illustrate the philosophy of an air-pump. A miserable, wo-begone
MAGDALEN may in like manner bring out the wisdom, and, what is
more, the fine humanity of a LAURIE. Let the reader be delighted
with the proof.
A forlorn young woman, named Elizabeth Moh RIs, a poor
seduced creature, is charged before the Knight with having taken
poison; whereupon his philosophy is immediately exhibited—the
human air-pump is instantly set at work.
“Sin Peter LAUR1E said he should send her to the Old Bailey for attempted suicide.
It was a fit case for trial, and he had no doubt she would be transported. He had put
AN END to PERsons ATTEMPTING to Daown the Misklves ; he would now TRY
the same curs For AttkMPTED Poisoning. He had no doubt that those who took
poison did not do so for the purpose of self-destruction, but for the purpose of exciting
sympathy; and such morbid charity was more calculated to do injury than any-
thing else.”
-
Wise man—good man—great man He has “put an end " to one
mode of suicide—he will, by the potency of his many-featured genius,
guard every avenue to death. He will stand sentinel on the banks
of Styx, and, by virtue of his power as an Alderman, forbid Charon
to take any shivering ghost into his boat that has not lawfully quitted
the flesh. He will, in a word, make death respectable, by placing it
out of the reach of the poor and desperate, until it shall be properly
awarded by disease or famine. Sapient magistrate—great northern
wizard of the human heart 1
Laurie will put an end to suicide We have heard something of
the ecstasy of soul that possessed NEwton, when the law of gravi-
tation burst in a flood of glory on his brain; something, too, have
we heard of the moral transport of a JENNER, when his mind
grasped the antidote to fell disease. From this we can have some
faint, very faint, idea of the sublimated state of a Laun IE, when, on
the tiptoe of his intellect, he grasped the golden secret that, even
among Aldermen, will immortalize him. We see him, arrectis auribus,
. hear his exulting soul braying like a trumpet, or some other
thing !
But wherefore, LAURIE, with the impatience of genius, begin at
the wrong end ? ... It is good to put down suicide—yea, very good.
Die when you will, you have earned an epitaph bright and enduring
as the stars.

What a climax to a tombstone laudation I Thus, the public life
of LAURIE will practically realise the Portuguese perfection of a

Great LAURIE :
But wherefore, again we ask—Oh, Launie —wherefore begin at
the wrong end ? Why not, great moral physician, first try to put
down the heart-achef Why not, from the high seat which, for some
yet inscrutable good, fortune has awarded you, why not, as you are
so potent over the human machine, with all its passions, its moral
aches and miseries, its weariness, its utter recklessness of all, yea,
even of LAURIE—why not cleanse the soul of “that perilous stuff.”
that sinks it to the grave?
Have you ever tried, LAURIE * Where is it written that from your
judgment-place you have ever bestowed one word of sympathising
humanity? Where shall we find one expression that, for a moment,
linked your ineffable nature to the shivering misery at the bar—that
| made you, in your Aldermanic dignity, take for one instant common
ground with forlorn wretchedness—with sorrow, stung by scorpion
wrong into despair Where shall we read of this That it is
written, yea, in a thousand leaves, we doubt not. We only ask—
where 3 Are the records yet extant; or, like the wisdom of the
Sybil, is the wise humanity of a LAURIE scattered to the winds t
‘Amū je ball no tigubt ºbe mould be Cransportcu.
Who shall say that the hard duty of an Alderman has not still its
rewarding consolation ? Yes; it is something after a weary day's
labour at Guildhall to know, or at least to hope for the transportation
of one broken heart. Sir JAMEs GRAHAM has his luxury in the
expatriation of a MARY Fun LEY. Wherefore, then, should not
LAun IE grease his moral chin with a like savoury morsel ? When the
master has dined off the haunch, it is hard if the lackey be denied
his little bit of marrowy fat.
And then, how passing pleasant to the spirit 1 when the day is
done, and the Alderman is making up his soul for the night—when
with serious looks and composed thoughts he has prayed for daily
bread, passing sweet must it be, as a LAURIE sinks into his
eider, to know that the fruit of his past day's wisdom may be the
transportation of some forlorn woman, driven to error by the want of
that bread whose very superflux makes the race of LAURIEs alder-
men. Surely these are thoughts that in the solemn night must sing
the brain and heart to rest, even as the songs of angels
Had a common biped, one of the unrecognised million, uttered the
words—wise as they are—of LAURIE, we should have passed them
as unheeded breath. But it is the dress of authority that makes
LAURIE remarkable; that attracts the eyes and ears of the world. We
can, in some way, parallel his position by a very recent example.
On the evening of the day that LAURIE let fall his last pearl, Mn.
BARRY, the clown at Astley's, embarked in a wash-tub on the
Thames, and was carried on his voyage from Vauxhall to Westmin-
ster by means of a pair of yoked geese. “MR. BARRY,” say the
accounts, “appeared in his Clown's dress.” MR. BARRY knows
human nature. Had he been simply habited, the attraction would
have been infinitely less. He would certainly have been associated
with the geese—perhaps, in the minds of the spectators confounded
with them—but he stood out to the eyes of men in his Zany's suit.
Now, what the whitened and vermilioned face—the many-coloured
dress—is to the Clown, so is authority, as employed by him, to SIR
PETER LAURIE. The Clown's suit and the civic gown are to the eye
of moral philosophy one and the same thing. There is no distinction,
none, between the mountebank's flaring livery and the Aldermanic
violet and miniver. We might also parallel the geese. The Clown
owed his onward progress and the safety of his seat to the birds. Well,
there may be Aldermen who also owe their progress and their seats
to creatures of kindred sagacity. Yet, is there one difference
between the Clown and the City Magistrate. Mr. Merryman, in the
exuberance of his antics, may draw tears of laughter; now the tears
excited by the Clown of the bench too often flow from a far different
source.
We have dwelt thus at length upon the peculiar merits of Sii:

PETER LAURIE, because we feel that we have sometimes neglected
him when in sooth he deserved especial notice. Thus our present
little essay is as much the offering of remorse as of admiration. We
can imagine a man in such a plethora of prosperity that all appeals
to his sensibility are vain. A man beyond the reach of moral medi-
cine. But such a man is not SIR PETER LAURIE. We can, indeed,
imagine a man so prosperous, with so much of the world's fat about
his heart, that the poor, stifled organ scarcely beats or feels : that
like a toad in marble, it lives, indeed, but stirs not. This man has
walked through life upon lamb's-wool. He has ever been fortunate.
Worldly Luck kissed him in his cradle, dandled him, put him upon
his feet, and said, “My child, be rich 1” And the world to him has
been, as the children say, all “Tom Titº LER’s ground,” where he has
picked up nothing but gold and silver. And wherefore this luck
Oh, it has been to him the equitable payment of his prudence, his
wisdom, his surpassing respectability. It is his rightful wages, and
he has nothing but his hard own. He has never felt the pangs of
want—he has never known his brain, after long sickness of hope
deferred, fire into despair. Desperation, begot of the world's misery,
is to him high treason against his sovereign Lord PLuTus—a flying
in the face of the Bank—a sort of blasphemy against those worldly
divinities—£ s. d. 1
And so this man turns up his varnished cheek at human despair,
and with triumphant looks of cunning and incredulity peers at
misery, as some self-imagined wit looks at the tricks of a conjuror,
pitying the fools who are gulled by him, and, full of his own wisdom,
declaring that he is not at all deceived; not he. He has watched the
whole legerdemain, and can tell how every trick is done. Fools may
admire, but he is not to be juggled.
To return, however, to SIR PETER LAURIE. His conquest of
suicide by water and poison is, perhaps, among the greatest triumphs
of the human mind. It will make him a noted man while on the
earth, and will embalm his memory when departed from it. May
that day, however, be long distant But when it comes, as come it
must, let a grateful generation pay all honour to departed wisdom.

Remarkable Resemblance between the Two Greatest characters of the Present nay.
THE SERVICEABLE PENSIONERS.
WE perceive that there is a determination on the part of Government
to galvanise the Chelsea Pensioners, with a view to active service.
Service, it is true, may be exacted from these veterans, but activity is
wholly out of the question. Their occupations for the last few years
have been any thing but military; in fact, they have been so exceedingly
civil, that holding horses at Kensington Gardens, and touching their hats
to every one who goes in, has been their chief employment.
A return of their various pursuits would be a very amusing, not to
say, a particularly interesting paper. For instance, many of the brave
fellows would have been found, reposing from the fatigues of war in the
tranquil art of window cleaning, while others have taken off the laurel of
victory to replace it with the powder of footmanship.
Some who helped to beat the French on the field of Waterloo, have
taken to the congenial occupation of beating carpets in the fields at
Battersea. Altogether the occupations of the pensioners since the
war have savoured strongly of peace, and the polite arts of waiting at
table, or delivering messages, have superseded the warlike employments
they had been previously accustomed to.
GRATTAN THE SLEEPLESS.
A few nights since, MR. H. GRATTAN took up his quarters at GREshaw's
Hotel. A little before midnight the hon. gentleman snored so violentl
that, for the peace of the house, it was necessary to wake him, althou
it took three chambermaids, two waiters and the boots to perform the
operation....This is too bad, when the orator had solemnly promised
that “until repeal was granted, he would never know a comfortable

THE REPORTERS AT BLAIR ATHOL.
The movements of the gentlemen of the press who have been sent
down from London by the different journals to dodge her Majesty, have
necessarily been very eccentric, and we therefore beg leave to publish
some account of them in the shape of a
Newspaper Court Circular.
The Times reporter left his room before five, in order to have the very
i. peep through the park palings, at the morning promenade of her
ajesty.
The ioning Chronicle correspondent gave an audience to the intoxi-
cated Highlander who had created a disturbance at Blair Athol. The cor-
respondent instantly sent off an express, containing exclusive particulars.
The Morning Post reporter sat for some time concealed in a bed of
stinging nettles, expecting the QUEEN would have passed that way. Her
Majesty did not leave the Castle.
The correspondent of the Morning Herald was honoured with an
exclusive squint through a fissure in the panelling of the room at the
Inn where Her Majesty was tasting some brose. Papers were instantly
forwarded to town with the interesting intelligence.

OPENING OF THE NEW EXCHANGE.
UNch is happy to record that MR. LAMBERT
Jones (the great lion of the city) has been
for this week past characteristically active;
that is, he has been labouring heart and soul
for the dignity of the city — such dignity
ºf being intimately associated with the impor-
tance of MR. LAMBERT Jon Es. After all
the world would be a very dull world with-
out the family of the Jones Es; and we
notice their doings with admiration mingled
with gratitude.
It is well known that the Queen has
accepted MR. Jon Es's invitation to the
city to witness the opening of the Royal
Exchange. Great preparations are being
made to amuse IIer Majesty; to which end,
engagements have been made with many
celebrated individuals, all of them specially
selected by MR. LAMBERT Jones. We
cannot flatter ourselves that our programme of the intended doings
is complete; but we pledge ourselves to its correctness as far as it
Roes.
§ In the first place, Ma. LAMBERT Jon Es has engaged himself to
give a faithful description of the statues perched about the Exchange
—their origin and purpose; this lecture is looked for with the great-
est anxiety.
SIR PETER LAURIE will, in three jokes—being the positive, the
comparative, and the superlative of bad—next illustrate what the City
Chamberlain meant, when he alluded to “Sir Peter's peculiar style
of badinage.”—SIR PETER will further illustrate this by a new song,
written by Ma. Rob ERT Montgomery, to be called “The Ass that
danced among the Chickens.”
The present Lond MAYon will next read through the whole of
Mrs. Rundell's Cookery, carefully marking the dishes which have not
graced his table during the present year; with the number of guests
not invited to partake of them.
MR. ALDERMAN Gibbs will recite a poem on the benevolent pur-
pose of the Margate Sea-Bathing Infirmary. He will do this in cha-
racter, being dressed as Sinbad's Old Man of the Sea; a part in which
he has already obtained great notoriety in Walbrook. After the
recitation, it is expected that he will go round with a hat for contri-
butions, which he will give a proper account of when he likes.
Mr. GEoRGE Jones will read his forthcoming volume of “America”
—the volume which, according to the testimony of MR. G. R. P.
JAMEs, it has so “provoked the Duke of WELLING'ron to wait for”
—and will prove that the Phoenicians first came to London for “tin.”
to SIR Thomas GREshAM. M.R. Jon Es will next attempt to prove
the difference between “bulls and bears;” taking a Royal Exchange
bull and the bull of Sin Rob ERT PEEL–an Exchange bear and one
of MR. TYLER's bears of the Surrey Gardens.
A celebrated member of the Antiquarian Society will deliver a
short lecture on cats; illustrating his subject by several kittens, all
descended in a right line from the cat of Richand WhittingtoN,
and so possessing peculiar claims on the attention of the city.
A member of the Archaeological Society will exhibit the first
vibration—duly attested—of Bow Bell.
Ma. Moon (ex-Sheriff) will sing “The light of other days is faded,”
and “The Moon has gone down.” He will, after this—and all for the
encouragement of British art—sit half-an-hour for his own portrait;
whilst DR. CRoly will make a poetic speech on the virtues and
commercial liberality of the ex-Sheriff.
And, as a crowning glory, SIR PETER LAURIE will receive a gilt
gingerbread medal, presented to him by the whole of the Humane
Society, for his unparalleled efforts in putting down suicide by water.
The Apothecaries' Company will next present him with a bottle of
real British brandy, for his good intentions in the matter of suicide
by poison. -
These are a few of the events intended to grace the opening of the
Royal Exchange—but only a few. However, should we hear of
others, we will duly advertise them.
2
Public Exhibition.
The (very) extraordinary collection of figures in the Collection of
LDERMAN Gibbs are now on view. Tickets may be obtained by those
rsons who can procure them, on application at Walbrook.
HER MAJESTY'S RETURN.
WE are sorry that this happy occasion has been sullied by one
remarkable instance of the weakness of human nature. It has been
beautifully said by somebody—ourselves, we rather think—that
“beadles are but men; ” and the same afflicting truth must, hence.
forth, be told of the Dundee constables. These wretched specimens
of mortal frailty, instead of keeping off the crowd from the QUEEN
and PRINcE ALBERT at Dundee, actually swelled the mob at Her
Majesty's heels by their own indomitable curiosity. We know it is
difficult, at all times, to smother the man in the constable ; but it
is necessary that the old ADAM should be temporarily suppressed
in the breasts of those who are appointed to keep off the crush of the
crowd from royalty. The QUEEN was, however, literally run down
at Dundee by the very myrmidons whose duty it was to have kept
the space around her perfectly clear; and PRINCE ALBERT was
compelled to turn round to request the constabulary to keep a
respectful distance, as they were treading down at heel the very
shoes of royalty.
It will have been observed that PRINCE ALBERT came back in
the white hat with the black crape-band, notwithstanding the fact
of the chapeau having been smashed a week or two ago by Punch's
bâton. Why he will persist in wearing such an unsightly head-gear
it is far beyond our philosophy to discover.
Among other incidents of the return must be noticed, the handing
out of the Princess Royal from the barge, by RENN1ck, one of the
royal footmen. RENNick is henceforward an historical personage,
and his name will find a place in the appendix of all future editions
of the Histories of England. Among the questions adapted for
schools, we shall no doubt have, after
When did Victor 1A ascend the throne 2
When was the Princess Royal taken out of the barge by RENN1ck
There is no doubt that RENN1ck is now A 1 among the Buck-
ingham Palace flunkies.
We ought not to omit to notice the gallant and seamanlike exploit
of Lond Adolphus FitzcLARENce, who superintended the landing
of a great portion of the packages belonging to Her Majesty. His
Lordship exhibited considerable tact, and directed the movements of
the crane with much skill and energy. He personally presided for a
few minutes at the wheel, and it is whispered that the rank of first
Lord of the Luggage will be bestowed upon him in the brevet that is
expected to take place in honour of the King of the French's visit.
33ritisi) āşşotiation for tijt 3bbanſtment of $firmſt.
We regret to find that the British Association wound up the meeting of
the present year with a row among the members themselves, and an
expression of ill-humour at their having been the subject of ridicule.
The last discussion which took place ought to have been referred to the
Meteorological Section, for it was exceedingly stormy, and the speakers
kept bouncing backwards and forwards, in and out at the door, to have the
last word in reply to something or other that was dropping from somebody
who had not yet taken up his hat for the purpose of leaving the meeting.
Several members of the various sections were at high words in the lobby;
and the ejaculations “mismanagement l” “humbug ' " were once or
twice distinctly audible.
A Paper on the “Dog” had been previously read by DR. Hodgkin, in
which the worthy Doctor imitated the barkings of all the different kinds
of dogs, and made some very learned observations on the African jackal.
He also went into the early history of the ordinary growl, and illustrated
the snarl by a series of musical efforts which were not very successful.
In his assumption of the various looks of the different dogs, the hon.
member was much happier. He went through the whole of the nine
countenances given as illustrations to his paper in the Illustrated London
News; but he was particularly felicitous as the old English hound, for
which the natural mildness of his countenance admirably adapted him.
By putting on a wig he “made up" exceedingly well for the Iceland
Dog, and by the aid of a pair of shaggy eyebrows, he contrived to give
the company a fair notion of the Wolf Dog, but he completely failed in
his portraiture of the Scotch Terrier. On the whole this was one of the
most successful papers that were read at the meeting.
We now take leave of the British Association, whose efforts at advano.
ing science have ended in their bringing science to exactly where it was
thirteen years ago—they met at York in 1831, and were at York in 1844.
So that § have just come round to the point they started from.

160 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
==TS=
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE TWELFTH-OF TITLE BY PURCHASE;
AND FIRST, BY ESCHEAT.
purchase in its vulgar sense is giving
money for a thing and getting it;
but as the law contemplates the possi-
bility of giving money for what one
never gets, as well as getting what one
never pays for, the word purchase in
its legal signification is very large, for
the law calls every man a purchaser
who has got hold of property almost
anyhow. The word purchase is de-
rived from perquisitio, and there are
five methods of purchasing, the first
, being Escheat, to which, probably on
account of its final syllable (cheat),
[.. the law gives the preference. Escheat
is a sort of interruption to the course
of descent by which the original lord gets his estate back into his own
hands, by an escheat or cheat—the former being merely the long and
the latter the short of it. The law of Escheat is founded on the suppo-
sition that the blood of the last tenant is extinct and gone, so that as
Coke says, “y” tenant failing in bloodde yº lordde walketh in and bones
ye propertie.” There are three modes by which Escheats may arise,
1st. Where the tenant dies without relations, not even a brother or an
uncle, then “y” lordde,” says Coke, “doth supplie relations by coming in
and cozening yº tenant out of his possessions.” A monster cannot take
by the law of the land, though giants—who are monsters—have taken
prodigiously at Greenwich Fair, and it does not seem that their caravans
became escheated.
Illegitimate children are incapable of being heirs, the law calling them
nullius filii (the children of nobody) which is in fact having a game of
None-of-my-child at the expense of the very ill used individuals
alluded to.
Aliens cannot be heirs; so that if Lord LYNDHURST's doctrine were the
right one, no Irishman could inherit English property. The dictum has,
however, been much doubted, and the noble Lord himself has contradicted
it. An alien cannot even purchase land, until he is made a denizen, or
translated from a foreigner into a British subject, when he may take
whatever he can get hold of. Our dramatists afford specimens of the art
of denization by translating French into English, though the subjects of
their denization do not always take to the extent that might be desired.
Another cause of Escheat was attainder, by which the property of all
the felons in Newgate or elsewhere would escheat to the lord; so that the
lord of the soil actually had an interest in all his grantees getting hanged
as speedily as possible.
By a recent act all men who are hanged after the 1st of January, 1834,
shall enjoy the privilege of leaving their property to their heirs, unless
murder or petty treason have been the crimes they suffer for. This
enjoyment is however a luxury that few—for want of property to leave—
have been able to take advantage of.
Before concluding this chapter it is necessary to observe that there is
no Escheat in the case of a corporation, and therefore the Lord Mayor
and Aldermen of London may all go and be hanged, without the doctrine
of Escheat coming into operation. In such a case as this the donor would
have the lands again by reversion, if the donor could be found, which
perhaps might be the case if he were advertised for, something in the
following fashion :-
“The corporation of London having been dissolved (by hanging, or as
the case may be) any gentleman who gave any lands is requested to apply
at the Mansion House, London, when he will hear of something to .
advantage.”
In this case the little GREshAMs would claim the site of the Royal
Exchange, and the heirs of Walth MAN would demand the strip of granite
set up like an isolated ninepin at the top of Farringdon Street in memory
of their illustrious ancestor.
So much for Escheats: but it never has been decided whether if a dust
contractor should be convicted of high treason in the middle of his
contract, the rubbish would escheat to the owner of the soil, or whether
the law would come down with the dust to the heir of the contractor. : ".
A Kindred Feeling.
At a meeting of the Pennsylvanian Repudiators, the following resolution
was put amongst loud cheers :-
Resolved,—That the freedom of the State be presented to Michael
Gibbs, Esq., the Lord Mayor of London, in a handsome money-box, as a
token of heartfelt admiration of his conduct as churchwarden, for twenty-
one years, of the parish of St. Stephen's, Walbrook.
Carried unanimously.
3bbertisement.
PRISON TO LET.
To be Let, that extensive and most commodious establishment, favour
ably known for many years to the nobility, gentry, and public in general
as The Fleet Prison. It may be taken with or without the turnkeys
As, however, the building, from its peculiar situation, might be made a
most profitable speculation as a theatre, the turnkeys might be found
valuable in domestic dramas. They will also go very cheap. The in-
creasing love of dramatic literature throughout the City of London suggests
the propriety of converting the Fleet into a Temple of the Drama; and
when it is recollected that the ensuing Mayoralty will (perhaps) be graced
by a Michael Gibbs, there can be no doubt but in some way or other
he will greatly contribute to the amusement of his fellow-citizens. With
this view, it is proposed that the Fleet should henceforth be known as the
Mayor's Theatre (the Sheriffs have Newgate to perform in), and that
Michael Gibbs should be manager, scene-shifter, &c. &c., of the same;
being in fact anything and overything, save money-taker and treasurer.
Should the premises not be considered available for a theatre, it is con-
fidently believed that they might be found admirably adapted for conver-
sion into alms-houses for decayed sheriffs' officers, and more especially for
those ill-used attornies, made more chary of discounting at 100 per cent.
by the atrocious bill of Lond Brough AM. In the Fleet they might find an
appropriate dwelling-place for their declining years.
Apply to the City Chamberlain.
AGRICULTURAL PREMIUMS.
EALLY, since 1830, the Warwickshire Agricultural
Society has spent no less than 15501. 10s.
6d. in prizes awarded to farmers’ labourers,
Punch is enabled to state how a part of
this vast sum was expended. At a recent
distribution the following prizes were
awarded :— |
To Giles Joskins, head carter-to Mr.
Hobbs, of Mire End, sixpence and a pot of
beer, for eloquence in talking to his horses.
To Thomas Noakes, labourer in the ser-
vice of MR. StAREs, of Thistlecroft, a four-
penny piece and a screw of tobacco, for pro-
ficiency in whistling at the plough.
3 To SARAH GALE, milkmaid to Mr.
Applejohn, of Chalk Dairy, a new cap, a
pair of cotton stockings, a case of darning
needles, and a thread paper, for distinguish-
ing herself in singing at the pail.
To Bill, Jones, odd boy to Mr. Sykes, of Clod Farm, two penn'orth of
lollipops for keeping birds.
QIbe jountains in QTrafalgar $quart.
ON our last examination of these capacious scolloping shells, we |
observed that a sort of deposit of orange peel, bits of paper and dirt, has
formed at the bottom of them. Nothing is said about laying on the water,
the Commissioners of Woods and Forests having commenced a well, but
in compliance with the principle of leaving well alone, nothing has been
done with it. If Nelson had had no more water to distinguish himself upon
than that which his statue is likely to get to show him off to advantage,
the song of the death of Nelson would never have been written.
We have heard bathing the eye in cold water recommended as a remedy
for soreness. We strongly recommend the cold water cure for the great
public eyesore in Trafalgar-square at the present moment. If Govern-
ment can't afford to lay the water on, let every patriotic householder
bring a bucketful from his own private cistern, in the same spirit that the
Spartan women cut off their hair to make bowstrings-though, by the
by, if the Spartans had only thought of cutting off their horses' tails, the
experiment would have been a much more successful one.
...At all events, the Commissioners of Woods and Forests may have
plenty of cold water from the Punch Office; and we shall begin to lay it
on regularly every week, if we do not see some efforts made to ..". the
fountains in Trafalgar Square with the cheap and nutritious element
alluded to.
RAILWAY INTeLLIGENCE.
We are glad to perceive that the Kensington Railway has added another
line—by branching off into the vegetable line—having planted a few winter
cabbages on a portion of the ground belonging to the railroad. The greens
will, we understand, be presented to the shareholders as emblematical of
their own condition.

ADMIRALTY Olt DERS–THE TANGIER LETTERS.
oME of our readers will, we hope, be
gratified to know, that in conse-
quence of the offence taken by
France at the publication of the
Tangier correspondence, the English
Admiralty has issued a list of stand-
ing orders to the fleet for the better
conduct of our hardy tars in all
future cases. Perhaps it is the first
time that CHESTERFIELD was ever
so ceremoniously introduced on the
quarter-deck. We subjoin a copy
of the Orders :—
“The Lords of the Admiralty,
desirous that the most polite and
ceremonious observances be culti-
vated, under all circumstances, by
the officers of Her Majesty's navy
towards the officers of the navy of France, publish the following
Orders—
“That in all cases in which an English ship shall witness the
gunnery of the French, such gunnery shall be considered with the
tenderest indulgence.
“That English officers shall not, under pain of dismissal from the
service, write or cause to be written any letter, passage, or mono-
syllable, expressive of any feeling save that of unbounded admira-
tion at the expertness, precision, and coolness of the French navy,
although every operation of the said force be ineffective, lubberly,
and unseamanlike.
“That English officers, being servants of the QUEEN, are to con-
stantly bear the fact in mind that they are not—in cases of attack
by the French on a friendly power—to trust to the uncertain evi-
dence of their own senses. That, on the contrary, they are, under
all circumstances, to conform to the general order, and to declare
the gunnery and seamanship of the French to be perfect, past
imitation.
“That in all cases, officers are to consider and speak of the
PRINCE Joinville as the French NELson.
“And finally, that every ship shall, henceforth, carry a civilian—
to be called naval historiographer to the French—who will chronicle,
in proper complimentary phrase, all the operations of our friendly
ally—to be published in an extraordinary Gazette, for the better
satisfaction of the people of England.”
Here follow the usual signatures.
-REGISTRATION COURT EXTRAORDINARY.
CITY OF LONDON.—MR. PUNCh’s CASE.
MistER PUNch having made his claim, entered an objection to himself,
and the learned Revising Barrister having been much mithered by this
proceeding, took time to consider. At length he delivered the following
judgment. - -
MR. Ahnold said: “This gentleman claims to have his name inserted in
the list of liverymen; and I think the peculiarity of his costume brings
him within the description of a liveryman, for he clearly wears a livery.
I think I need only refer to Velveteen versus Plush, 19 East, to make my
own mind, and everybody else's mind, perfectly easy upon that point. It
has been urged that the claimant is a freeman, and undoubtedly there is
no man whose freedom is more decided. There is the case of Mister Punch
himself against Michael Gibbs, in which even the defendant Gibbs was
constrained to admit that Punch was more free than welcome ; therefore,
as a freeman, I think his claim must be admitted. It has been objected
that Punch is a pensioner, because he takes the public money; but
here, I think, common sense comes in and quashes the objection, because
his taking money is an obligation he confers upon the public, not the
The only
real difficulty I find in this case is, that Punch has objected to himself,
though I really don’t see how any one else could possibly have objected
to him, because he is wholly unobjectionable. This is proved by reference
to the Books—I mean his own volumes.” -
The learned Revising Barrister went on to observe, that finding both
sides very nearly balanced, he had written out the arguments on separate
pieces of paper, and put them in a pair of scales; and he had, on the
whole, come to the decision that Punch's claim would have been allowed
—there being a preponderance of two pennyweights—but the claimant's
own scruples preponderated over the pennyweights, and thus the claim
fell to the ground.
THOUGHTS SUGGESTED TO A GENT. AT GRAVESEND,
on
THE CHIVALRY OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AS
COMPARED witH THE NINETEENTH.
BARon of N– 1 when I viewed to-day
That form of dignity, and step of grace,
Mix in the saraband so free and gay,
And marked thy bland benevolence of face,
I fell to dreaming of an elder day,
And of the haughty Fathers of thy Race
I thought,who such benign pursuits abhorr'd,
And to the Polka much preferred the sword.
º Noses and ears from lazy serfs to lop,
The Lords of N thought it not a sin;
Nought their volcanic violence could stop,
Burning and smashing all with horrid din;
As though the realm had been a china-shop,
And they the bulls that did disport therein:
Whilst thou amid the tea-things, in and out,
Dancest sublime, and breakest ne'er a spout 1
HEINRich Von N was a shocking swell ;
He built the “Mouse-tower” in the Rhine afar,
And burnt his vassals in a barn, they tell,
Shouting, “The merry mice They dance I ha, ha 1–
So that that wicked nobleman may well
Be decmed inventor of the entre-chat;
IIe was the second of thine ancient name,
But thou, oh Baron, art the first in fame.
,
Another Baron too (who will not rhyme)
Was fond of dancing, when his wars were o'er;
But turned the gentle art into a crime;
For, wanting sport and finding peace a bore,
He, to beguile the lagging of the time,
Would light a fire beneath his dungeon floor;
So that the prisoners, for fear of scars,
Danced an intuitive Polka on the bars.
Thy fifteenth grandsire by the mother's side,
Was the most rampant Margrave of them all ;
He, after raising plunder far and wide,
Held roaring revel in his castle-hall;
With lawless riot he the night defied:
Thou, with thy peaceful graces in the ball,
Win'st due subservience to thy gentle laws,
And dost from noisy gents. extort applause !
We deem not thee degenerate—ah, no
Much we delight to mark thy raven hair
Along the gay quadrille so featly flow,
Thy mild address, and gentlemanly air–
Far nobler triumphs than those deeds of woe—
Still be the waltz and Spanish dance thy care I
For peer or peasant, Baron, Count, or Bart.,
To be a GENT. is still the noblest art?
Long may the honours thou so well dost wear,
Adorn that gentle, though baronial, brow;
And though the coronet thou still must bear,
May it sit lightly on thy head, as now !
Never for politic or courtly care,
Or lust of power, thy needful rest forego;
Ne'er be the golden canon lost on you,
That with its Rights, RANK has its duties too !
FRIENCE FORESIGHT.
The King or the FRENch being about to leave the country for a few
days, it has been thought necessary to delegate the royal authority to the
Duc pe. NEMoURs, who is only to act in case of a revolution occurring
directly Louis-Philippe's back is turned. The Duc DE NEMouhs is
consequently KING for a fortnight, which, for a country like France, is
not a very contemptible tenure of sovereignty. The PRINCE DE Joinville,
is to remain at his elbow all the time; and, but for the sober character of '
the Duc de NEMours, we should be almost afraid that the young men
would get, what is vulgarly termed, “larking” with their father's crown,
and place it in jeopardy. -
We understand that one of Louis-Philippe's reasons for leaving
France is to try how the French would get on without him. If there
were many countries like France, it would answer tolerably well for
somebody to start a revolutionary insurance office, with a capital of a few
small kingdoms, so that every Monarch who subscribed might, in the
event of being burnt or barricaded out of one kingdom, be indemnified
with a throne in another.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GOG AND MAGOG IN MOURNING.
NOWING that God and MAGog
are only ligneous dignities—
giants of mere wood, we do
not wonder at there being,
now and then, a strange sym-
pathy between them and the
Lord Mayor for the time.
Nay, this sympathy has on
many an occasion extended
to the Court of Aldermen,
several of whom may be con-
sidered especial parts of Gog
and Magog; log of their log
and wood of their wood. It
is extraordinary what chips
of the old blocks have been
known to preside at city police
courts Thus the election of
all civic dignities has its effect
upon the giants. As in the
olden day when the statues of the gods were sometimes known to
perspire at the presumption and wickedness of men, so on the eve
of last St. Michael's day, did Gog and MAGog sweat at the folly of
the Court of Aldermen I Gibbs Mayor This was a calamity too
great even for heart of oak. A deep groan burst from either bosom.
For half an hour, did giant moan to giant; and then—we have it
on the faith of our own reporter—they gave their sorrows words:–
Gog. Michael Gibbs Mayor He of the hard fist the Lord of
City hospitality
Magog. The Man of No Account the twelvemonths king of
London's merchant-princes ! -
Gog. The Churchwarden in Chancery London's first magistrate
Magog. I have it, Gog. Alas! I see the cause of this Woe—woe
for London :
Gog. How What? Confide these sorrows to your friend.
Magog. It is quite plain the city's coming to a close. All London's
bankrupt, both in character and goods. We shall be sold off, and,
slit into lucifers, be scattered throughout the land.
Gog. Impossible !
Magog. Or worse than all—with Gibbs for Mayor—how shall we
'scape Chancery No ; we shall be flung into that most direful
limbo, and no account be rendered of us.
Gog. Will Temple Bar be safe
Magog. I doubt it. I pray the city gods it may stand the mayor-
alty of Gibbs :
Gog. And Newgate
Magog. That, perchance, may be respected.
Gog. And Bow Bell ?
Magog. That may be preserved. GIBBs may treasure that, where-
with to ring the knell of London.
Gog. And the Mansion-house, and in truth, all the property of the
city ?
Magog. Chancery, Gog, Chancery 'twill all go into Chancery.
Even the dragons of the city arms will be passed over to Lord LYND-
Hurst. Nothing will be left the Corporation save the dagger, which,
if it have any sense of its degradation, it will immediately plunge into
its heart. It never will—it never should—survive the mayoralty of
Gibbs
Gog. And the sheriffs' chains,—and the aldermen's gowns–
Magog. And Sir PETER LAURIE’s “badinage,”—
Gog. And London stone,—
Magog. All—all into Chancery 1 Our own clock here won't strike
without leave of Lord LYNDHunst. London and its glories all are
gone A heavy day will be the ninth of next November 1 An you
love me, three groans for that day !!!
The groans were earnestly delivered ; and then the giants lapsed
into their customary silence. The next day they appeared in deep
THE HONOUR OF THE BAR.
In order that every barrister at the Old Bailey may have an equal
chance, we should recommend that the same system should be adopted as
that which has been found so convenient in the case of cabs. It might be
arranged that an usher of the Court should act as a kind of waterman, to
regulate the movements of the legal gentlemen, and prevent that pre-
cipitancy in rushing forward for #. which might occasion an inconve-
nient pressure on the clients. . To what extent they might be allowed to
hail the public for business might be a matter of arrangement, but we
think their solicitations ought not to go beyond the simple exclamation of

MARTYRS MADE EASY.
WE have the liveliest belief that, with our onward moral and
physical progress, some invention will be jumped at by which eels
may be even skinned to their own self-satisfaction. We know, it is
the theory of some philosophers, that already the frequent endurance
of excoriation makes the matter a mere bagatelle to the sufferer.
With time however, we have no doubt, the operation will be a
positive pleasure. We ground our hope in this, in the condition of
O'Connell, the Martyr There can be no doubt that the Liberator
has suffered a martyrdom to which the gridiron of St. Lawrence
must have been a bed of roses. Indeed, look through the martyr-
ology; count suffering by suffering : and when every agony is
counted, what are they all to the multiplied horrors endured by the
Martyr of the Writ of Error? And yet, with what heroic constancy
—aided by the fattest and the best in the way of meat and drink—
has DANIEL suffered his torments : What a blithe look he puts

LETTER XXIX.
FROM THE HON. MRs. FLINT to LADY honoria AsphaI.T,
ON THE CHOICE OF A GOVERNESS. -
DEAR MADAM,
I REsu ME my pen to finish my
º, subject; and as I have had considerably more
experience than yourself in the article of
governesses, I will briefly tell you how I
have always dealt with these people. You
will then be able to contrast my practice with
your own. Like myself when a very young mother, you have been
too considerate—too yielding. Firmness, dear madam, firmness is
the first essential — young governesses are as difficult to break
as young horses; but it is to be done.
I told you that I always had my suspicions of SINCLAIR's German
—I am sure it was not the true Saxon. Now I have never engaged
a governess unless she had acquired French, German and Italian in
their separate countries. Nothing like studying a language on its
proper soil, otherwise the accent of the children becomes irretrievably
ruined. It was only last week that my dear friend, LADY DINAH
GRosBEAK, called me in to examine a candidate for the place of daily
governess. The creature had certainly learned French in Paris, but
she knew no more of Florence or Dresden than the city giants. She
played the piano remarkably well, and brought excellent testimonials
to her knowledge of thorough bass. She sang, too, very nicely—and
if the water-colour paintings she produced were really her own, they
were-for I always like to do justice to everybody—very pretty.
However, with all her accomplishments, humility was not among
them, for what do you think she asked of LADY DINAH to attend
only her three children as daily governess? Positively, thirty pounds
a year, and, by way of climax—her dinner
However, to proceed with my own experience. Knowing the
artifice of governesses—feeling assured that it is necessary to be quite
alive to their whims and caprices, I always made it a principle to
deduct their salary for any week or even day of illness. Bless you,
madam, without this precaution, there is no knowing what one might
lose in sham fevers and surreptitious headaches. Let your governess
be aware of your inflexibility on this point, and be assured she is
never ill; or if she is, it is all the same, you never hear of it. Again,
I never allowed a bell in the bed-room of a governess—otherwise,
the poor servants would, I knew, be continually rung up and down.
No ; if the governess wanted anything, she could certainly somehow
get it, without raising the house for it. On one occasion, too, when
we left town—leaving some of the children at home, I gave to the
governess a proper dietary; a certain scale of food which it was my
order was not to be departed from. As I had to pay for the meat,
bread, butter, milk, &c. to be consumed, I was of course the only
fitting judge of the quantity—that is, for a governess.
There are, however, occasions when appearances may justify a
little extra outlay on a governess. For instance, when my dear
father died—ha, madam 1 if ever there was a true Christian, he was
one—I made my person a present of a dress and bonnet. In fact, I
had three dresses for my maid, the nurse, and governess, all alike.
A little liberality of this sort towards our fellow-creatures is, after
all, not lost in this world, and can do us no harm in the next.
Whenever it was necessary that my governess should join any of
my little social parties, I of course never introduced her. No–it was
perfectly well understood who she was, and she was never drawn
out of her place—never for a moment confounded with any of tho
ladies present. It is convenient, too, now and then, to have these
persons with you : they relieve a dull moment or so in an evening,
when desired to take the stool and play. And even here, one must
be very guarded, lest the governess forgets herself. I remember on
one occasion, a governess I had—a pale, puling thing, with large blue
eyes and flaxen hair, and by the way, a cough that entirely made
her singing a bad bargain—I remember that whilst she played, she
once suffered my nephew Adolphus to turn the music | But when
we retired, didn't I school her ? She had red eyes for a fortnight.
I had written thus far, when I received the letter that accom-
panies this. It is from a young woman who has never yet been
from home. She has been splendidly brought up, but her father
would speculate in hops or some such things, and they are all
beggars. Having a sort of feeling for the family, and hearing that
the girl must go into the world, I wrote to her—with a view to your
service—asking her notions of the duties and responsibilities of a
governess—the treatment she expected, &c. &c. You will read her
reply. It is exquisite. Quite a leaf from an old French romance.
Poor thing 1 with such ideas, what will become of her I will,
however, look somewhere else for you; in the mean time,
Believe me, yours always,
Do notite A FLINT.
LETTER XXX.
FROM A YOUNG i.Aldy DESirou8 OF AN ENGAGEMENT AS FAMILY
GOVERNESS.
MADAM,
IT is, indeed, true that the sudden and total wreck of my
father's fortune, renders it necessary for me to earn my own bread;
and, unhappily, not mine alone. Your letter, kind madam, came
like a sunbeam upon our darkened dwelling. Now, indeed, do I feel
grateful—past expression—for the few attainments I possess, for they
will enable me to bear with cheerfulness the change prepared for
me. They will raise me above the indifference and contempt of the
world; and whilst they supply me with the means of honourable
existence—and what, indeed, so honourable, so truly lofty, as a life
dedicated to the mind of childhood —they may haply not be
deemed wholly useless to others. I am now tranquil—decided.
When the truth first came upon me that I must henceforth exist by
my own exertions, I own it, old vanities—the follies born of fortune
—clung for a moment closer to me. But I have laid apart false
pride like a masque-night garment.—I am instantly prepared to
begin my working life.
You ask my notion of the duties, the cares, the responsibilities of
a governess. Alas, madam it is a contemplation of their seriousness,
nay, of their solemnity, that makes me pause—falter, in my hopes.
I cannot but fear my own unworthiness for the task—it is so vital.
For is not the mind of childhood the tenderest, holiest thing, this
side heaven Is it not to be approached with gentleness, with love,
—yes, with a heart-worship of the great God from whom, in
almost angel-innocence, it has proceeded ? A creature undefiled by
the taint of the world—unvexed by its injustice—unwearied by its
hollow pleasures? A being fresh from the source of light, with some-
thing of its innocent lustre in it ! If childhood be this—how holy the
duty to see that, in its onward growth, it shall be no other To
stand, as a watcher at the temple, lest any unclean thing shall enter
it. This, surely, is one of the loftiest duties that can elevate infirm
humanity; and this duty is especially required of him or her who
tends upon the growing mind of youth : it is a task that, however
misunderstood by the many, ennobles the doer. I know that all the
world thinks not thus. I know, alas ! that there are mothers who
place their mere jewellery under bankers' locks, who, nevertheless,
trust the jewelled minds of their children to the keeping of a stran-
ger, with scarcely a thought of the fidelity of the keeper.
You have, now, inadam, my idea of the duties of a governess—of
her hard, her earnest, yet rewardful labours. As to her treatment,
she is—if conscientious in her vocation—a gentlewoman. She has
within her trust the greatest treasures that human life—with all its
pride—can know; the hearts and, indeed, the future souls of children.
As her mission is a noble one, respect and courtesy are hers by right.
To look upon her as a better-dressed drudge is, in very truth, not
poorest insolence alone, but darkest error. Her patient, quiet labours
are to insure the best triumphs of life; for they make, or should
make, good daughters, good wives, good mothers. In these the
truthfulness and happiness of the world have, surely, some stake,
and are, indeed, her lasting debtors.

I have heard many stories of the contumely, the hard-dealing of
the world towards the governess. It was not so in my home—and,
if only for the sake of woman, I must hope such tales are over-
charged. For if, indeed, the poor governess is this frequent sufferer,
to whom does she owe the misery, but to sister-woman? Of whom has
she to complain of coldness of looks, harshness of words, of all the
petty, reckless injuries that sting her daily life, of all the scorn of
pride, and arrogance of apathetic wealth Why, to woman; to her
richer sister; to one of her own sex—made hard, exacting, by unde-
served good fortune 1 This is a scandal, madam, that women should
rise against and defy ; or if not, they must, in truth, remain uncon-
scionable debtors to the poets.
With many thanks, madam, for the interest you have taken in our
broken fortunes,
I remain, yours gratefully,
MARY Wilton.

NICHOLAS AND THE JEWS.
WE fear that Nicholas in some measure anticipated his full renown
by his too hasty visit to England last summer. True it is, he was
received with open arms by English noblemen. Dukes, Whig and
Tory, scrambled to do him honour. Saloons were built for him,
which to this hour remain, as gorgeous evidences of the enthusiasm
of his hosts—things to be pointed out to future generations as made
little less than sacred by the temporary presence of the EMPERon
Nicholas. Though steeped from head to heel in the blood and tears
of Poland, he was approached as almost something divine by the
aristocracy of England. The “better classes” smiled, and ducked,
and “kissed their five fingers” to him, and were rewarded with gold
boxes and diamond rings in acknowledgment of such fealty. High-
born ladies of England—wives and mothers—conveniently oblivious
of the women of Poland, of their every domestic tie torn by the
autocrat asunder—were in a flutter of delight at the briefest glance of
the Emperor—he was so fine a man—so tall a man—so perfect a
gentleman :
And then, the Emperor to act out his part in the grim farce, paid
the homage of his gold to English Charity—and Charity, like
St En NE’s recording angel, must have blushed as she took the alms.
Well, the Emperor had even last summer great claims upon the
admiration of certain Englishmen; nevertheless, he came among us
too soon ; he should have waited some time longer, when the wrongs
and sorrows of another one-hundred-and-fifty thousand of his fellow-
creatures would, if possible, have made him more lustrous in the
eyes of his worshippers.
One hundred and fifty thousand souls | Such is the number of
helpless Jews driven by the order of the autocrat to the deserts of
the interior of Russia. Some Jews, it was found, upon the frontier
smuggled; whereupon the magnanimous Emperor ordered the removal
of the whole Hebrew body. At this moment the are being torn
from their homes; their property destroyed; their every privilege
as human creatures laughed to scorn. “They are compelled,” says
the National, “to seek an existence in the silent deserts of the
interior of Russia, where they will dispute the possession of those
immense wastes with the birds and beasts of prey which are their
sole population. There they will find their tomb : ”
After this, can it be doubted that Nicholas did not come too
early among us. Close and fervent, it is true, was the embrace
which PRINcE ALBERT bestowed upon him ; but how much sweeter
the welcome of Nicholas had he been associated with the woes of
a hundred and fifty thousand Hebrews | He ought to have waited
for this last triumph, and then the enthusiasm of certain of the
English must have been prodigious !
Besides, what extrinsic value would then have been added to the
gold boxes and brilliant rings As it is, they are of course very
grateful to their possessors—(albeit Punch would as soon have a toad
in his pocket and an asp about his finger), -but associated with the
groans and tears of 150,000 Jews, they would have been invaluable.
Moloch himself could give nothing more peculiarly costly.

THE SHERIFFS AT WESTMINSTER HALL.
RoM Stowe's Chronicles we learn that the annual
ceremony of chopping sticks, counting horse
shoes, and enumerating hob nails, is a very
important one. The new Sheriffs, HunreR and
Sidner, who had recently disjointed the official
noses of Musgrove and Moon, were presented to
the Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer by the
Recorder in a speech, abounding with what is
figuratively termed “soft soap.”
The Recorder ingeniously managed to make
out that the late Sheriffs were the best possible
Sheriffs in the world, but that the new Sheriffs
were better still ; so that all parties must have
been perfecty satisfied. The Cursitor Baron re-
plied by assenting to the assertion as to the
super-excellence of the old Sheriffs, and the extra
super excellence of the new Sheriffs.
| The Usher of the Court then produced a small bundle of spills, such
as are generally used for lighting wax-tapers to seal letters, and the
Senior Alderman having been presented with a chopper, began to chop to
the imminent peril of the Usher's fingers. Alderman Thomas Wood,
| being the Senior Alderman on this occasion, was at first a little awkward,
and the Usher of the Court, who is a wag, could not miss the opportunity
of saying, in allusion to the Alderman's rejection by the city and his
clumsiness at chopping the wood, “I should have thought, Sir, you must
have known how to cut your stick by this time.” Alderman Thomas
Wood threatened in a whisper that he would complain to the Cursitor
Baron, but the Usher merely mumbled, “Oh, no my fine fellow, you
know better than to do that ;" and the Alderman was compelled to finish
the operation.
A number of Horse-shoes and Hob-nails were then produced, when the
Sheriff of Middlesex was called upon to count them, a process designed
as a sort of examination of the Sheriff in the noble science of arithmetic.
The Cursitor Baron then set the Sheriff the following sum :—
As twenty Hob-nails are to sir Horse-shoes, how are you?
It is expected that the problem in question will be solved by about the
time that the Lord Mayor elect has made out his accounts to the satis-
faction of those who are interested in understanding them.
-
HER MAJESTY'S STRAW BONNET AND SHAWL.
The Sun, a few days since, stated that it had received several com-
plaining letters touching the plain dressing of the Queen. The writers
were astounded that her Majesty should wear a simple straw bonnet and
a plain shawl. Their notions of royalty were, doubtless, that royalty
should always appear with the crown on its head, the sceptre in one hand,
and the ball in the other. That this notion is the right one is evident
from the subjoined letter which the MARquis of London DERRY-assuming
his privilege as peer—has addressed to the Queen. It has all the marks
of the Marquis's casy style.
“MADAM,
“Deeply attached as I am—like my late lamented relative—to the
institutions of my country, I approach you with an earnest anxiety re-
specting your simple straw bonnet and plain shawl. Being second to none
in my attachment to the crown, and devotion to your royal person, may I
therefore humbly suggest that the true dignity of the crown is in danger
when so frequently supplanted by plain chip or Dunstable; and that the
royal purple cannot but be in peril when so often covered by a Paisley
or shepherd's plaid.
“The people, may it please your Majesty, confound º with
want of power. Use them to nothing but the bonnet and the shawl, and
the diadem and the imperial robes will be to them a fiction of the law.
In a brief time they will cease to believe even in the existence of such
things; and then—but I tremble to think of the revolutionary con-
sequences. The people are a vulgar, sight-seeing mob ; their eyes are, in
fact, the greatest part of them. The late lamented Geoage the Fourth
knew this, and fed their eyes, and nothing but their eyes, accordingly.
“Hoping, Madam, that you will not misconstrue my loyalty in this
lowly remonstrance, and further, that in all future journeys the plain
bonnet and the very plain shawl may give place to something more likely
to awe the swinish multitude,
“I remain, your Majesty's dutiful and most devoted Subject,
“LoNDoNner RY.
*P.S. PRINCE ALBERT's white hat and black band—forgive the expres-
sion, I can't help it—are positively vulgar. ... Why doesn't he always wear
his coronett Nobody can look better in it.”

TH: following frightful affidavit has been filed at the Punch Office:—The deponent has
offered to deposit with the Registrar-General two of his coats—one referring to the period
before—the other made for him after—the present Mayoralty.
- The deponent's measures may be inspected at his tailor's, in confirmation of his affidavit, and
the attesting witness will corroborate the facts in person to any purchaser of an entire set of
Punch, on application to the publisher.
Affidarit.—Sworn this day, before Mr. Punch, at his Office, 194, Strand.
BLANK Blank, being an Alderman of the City of London, maketh oath and saith, that, pre-
vious to the year 1843, he found himself from time to time, and at all times, unable to button his
coat, by reason of his great bulk, to wit, his excessive corpulency. And the said deponent
further maketh oath, and saith that no cloth or other woollen manufacture, however stout,
would have resisted the said stoutness of him the said deponent, whereof the torn button-holes
of the coat—now filed with the registrar general—do well and truly testify. And the said
deponent maketh oath and saith, that one MAGNAY, a stationer, became Lord Mayor of the City
of London: and the said deponent did dine at the Lord Mayor's dinner, and did retain his said
stoutness till the end of the year 1843. But the said deponent solemnly maketh oath and saith,
that from and after the commencement of the year 1844, he began gradually wasting, which your
deponent verily believes is only to be accounted for by the fact, that he had formerly consumed
for many years, divers soups, joints, savoury patties, pasties, and other viands, at sundry dinners,
banquets, and entertainments given at the Mansion House, which said soups, &c., as well as the
said sundry dinners, &c., have been wholly and completely discontinued since the said MAGNAY
has ruled—not the roast, for there is none—at the Mansion House.
And your deponent will ever pray that unless he is to ever fast, the said MAGNAY may never
again be permitted to occupy the civic chair to the extreme attenuation of the Aldermen.
Signed,
Attesting Witness, BLANK BLANK.

TO THE HUMANE.
Westminster Pit, Oct. 2, 1844.
DEAR PUNch,
I always said MR. MARTIN's Acts
would have a short life. What sense or
reason was there in them If people must
go humanity mad let them stick to their
blacks and their children, and not meddle
with the dumb uns as can't complain.
(Praise be for that same 1) However,
please inform our friends that “the Pit” is
open again, and police has order to wink at
us. In fact, ever since I read, with tears
of joy in my eyes, of the tame otter (a
natural wild un fights better, only, I sup-
pose, it could not be had), that was “run
into nearly at the feet of her Majesty, and
quickly despatched,” “ I have been con-
vinced the humanity game was all up.
Consequently, I immediately set to work
to anticipate the Lord Chamberlain's
orders, and am getting ready for a royal
reception at the old place. Evening to
commence with a badger bait; box to be
kept by Lord John Nix, with able assist-
ants; to conclude, time and life per-
mitting, with a few cats.
A duck hunt on or about Virginia Water
is in preparation ; particulars in future
announcements.
Constantly on hand—a good assortment
of bears, badgers, cats, rats, and other var-
mint, on the most reasonable terms, and at
short notice. Yours ever,
Tim Shiney.
P.S. We open in state, same day as the
Royal Exchange, so pray come ; and con-
sider you are the only person it has been
mentioned to at present, so make what use
of the information you like.

THE QUEEN AND THE OTTER.
THE glories of the bear-garden may yet return. The jocund, hearty
times, when royal Elizabeth gave the majesty of her countenance
to the baiting of Bruin, may not be irrevocably passed away. No ;
when Young England reads the account of the otter-hunt at Blair
Athol, at which Queen Victon 1A presided, the said Young England
may complacently pat its white waistcoat, believing that the wisdom
of our ancestors in the matter of bear-baiting will again be manifest.
Indeed, we do not see why cock-fighting should not again flourish in
all its wonted heartiness. We have even hopes of long-neglected
badger-drawing.
lſ seems that Lond ABERDEEN took his otter-hounds to Blair
Athol, where there were no native otters. In a word, the hounds
wer") appointed to a place in which there was nothing to do ; an ap-
pointment often made by Foreign Ministers, Whig and Tory. How-
ever, in due season, an otter was caught at Kelso, and transmitted in
a box, to be properly worried at Blair Athol.
We are told that the Strasburg goose, that is tortured to death for
the sake of its enlarged liver, “knows that it is dying for the honour
of France, and expires without a tear.” We have this comfortable
assurance in the Almanach des Gourmands. In like manner, the otter
—poor little wretch —may have known the greatness of its destiny
as it travelled in its box from Kelso, and thus have complacently
resigned itself to its fate. It may have known it was a living dish to
be set before a Queen, and been pleased with its fortune.
It poured with rain, but nothing could damp the heroic ardour of
the sportsmen. Even the Queen mounted her pony under an um-
brella; and PRINce A.I. bent particularly distinguished himself at
the onset—
“For the Prince of all the land
Led them on.”
We now come to the details :—
“The otter was started at a point under the hill of Tulloch, in the Garry water, a few
hundred yards above the village of Blair Athol. The Prince followed on foot close on
the hounds, which hunted the otter a short distance up the river, affording pretty good
sport, until at length, in about 20 minutes after the first start, he took to the land, and
was seized by one of the hounds. The huntsmen took him off, and flung him back
again into a deep pool. He darted to the other bank of the stream, where he earthed.
Unearthed again by the huntsmen, and started afresh, he gare the hounds some truuble
for about ten minutes longer, when they killed him, and he was speared in the usual
way by the huntsmen. The otter, when ſairly spent, crawled up the bank near where
the Quren was, and the hounds of course were upon it. Her Majesty turned away her
head while they were worrying the animal.”
This was to be expected ; but time and custom will eradicate this
amiable weakness, and we have no doubt that next season otters
may be worried to any extent without producing the slightest qualin
in even the bosom of a Maid of IIonour. In these matters use is
everything. The little Spanish girl, who may tremble and turn pale
at her first bull-fight, in a brief time witnesses all the glory of the
contest with smiling face and an applauding fan.
Great, however, as is the above achievement—glorious as it is to
contemplate the ardour of a PRInce Albert, the enthusiasm of a
Foreign Minister, with the tumultuous energy of Lords and Highland
Chiefs, appointed and arrayed for the destruction of one otter,
“sent in a box from Kelso,”—it is in itself as nothing compared to
its utility as an example. Thus considered, there is really something
of national importance in the otter hunt of Garry-water.
There is a troublesome body of persons, calling themselves the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. These people
have in the most meddlesome way interfered with the sports of the
lower orders. They have forbidden a harmless main of cocks; they
have set their faces against the pleasurable and innocent excitement
of dog-fighting; duck-hunting they have denounced as cruelty
abominable; indeed, there is no thorough English sport, enshrined
by the wisdom of our ancestors, that they have not condemned as
brutal and inhuman.
After the news from Blair Athol, we trust that these people will
feel themselves properly rebuked. Sure we are it will be more than
impertinence in them to interfere with the sports of our countrymen.
Hence, the bear may again be baited to the delight and edification
of Englishmen; the cock-pit at Westminster may echo the
triumphant clarion of conquering birds, and Copenhagen Fields be

PUNCH'S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER XXXI.
FROM A BISHOP TO A YOUNG FRIEND ABOUT TO TAKE ORDERS.
DEAR BASIL,
I have learned, with exceeding gladness, of your excellent
father, that it is your determination to enter the Church. From
what I know of your nature, I feel assured that this resolve is
not the offshot of a vagrant, unthinking disposition, but the goodly
fruit of a mind disciplined, and chastened of those vanities which, at
your age, too commonly beset mankind. Believing that your election
is that of an ardent and purified spirit, I hail it rejoicingly.
My dear young friend, be grateful—yea, in your inmost soul, be
grateful—that you have been directed to a choice which, whilst it
will abound with life-long satisfaction to yourself, will make you a
daily, providential comfort to your fellow-creatures. There is a
happiness in this belief, too deep, too awful for any words of mine—
a happiness only to be felt in the heart it consecrates.
From the moment of your ordination, you are set apart from the
gross, vain, foolish desires of men ; you are made a teacher and a
watcher of your kind—the counsel, the reproof of the pastor, directed
and softened by the love and sympathy of a brother. There is no
despair so wild that the music of your comforting may not tame to
gentleness and hope; there is no heart so stony that, smitten by your
word, may not be made to gush with a living stream. High privilege
—glorious prerogative, that makes man the mediator with Heaven—
that gives him strength to raise from the dust the faint, crushed,
guilt-defiled heart, assuring it a home and resting-place among the
stars :
From how many blighting evils, cancerous cares, will your high
office preserve you ! You will see men pursuing vain wealth and
vainer honours, even as little boys hunt butterflies; with frantic
glee they seize the thing pursued, and it is worthless in their grasp.
Whilst you, rich in the spirit that is within you, upraised by the
dignity of the awful future, will smile, though not in pride, but with
abounding pity, with compassionating love. To you poverty itself
will be a robe of highest state : and though most frugal be your
board, yet, as with the patriarch, angels may feast with you, though
men know them not.
In every stage of mortal life, you are the elected comforter, adviser
of mankind. Your glorious and beautiful mission begins with the
babe that shrinks and wails beneath the baptismal water, nor ends but
with the blessing prayer that leaves the image of man to become
again dust. From the fount to the grave how many the calls—how
many the necessities of your infirm and erring brother—for that hope,
that consolation, of which you are the chosen phial How beautiful
your daily intercourse with those who feed and thrive upon your
sayings How sweet that gentle familiarity that mixes itself in the
working-day life of the poor; that with soft greetings and kindly
smiles claims kindred with the meanest of the earth as fellow-
sojourners in future heaven : And now, hark it is black midnight,
and the tempest howls and claws like a famished wolf at your door.
The thunder rolls, crashing above your roof The lightning opens
up the sky in one wide vault of fire—and now it is dark, and the
wind moans like a despairing soul. There is a loud and urgent
knocking at your door—again—again Alas, dear sir, there is a
poor creature, a cotter, one of your flock, in his last agony. His soul
must from his flesh this awful night, and he begs your comforting,
your benediction on its solemn journey.
You spring from your bed. Your cloak is old—thin almost as a
web : nathless, you hug it closely around you, and with stout heart
and composed soul follow your guide through path and no path—bog
and mire. The thunder splits above you—the lightning chases your
steps: but like a good spirit sent on God's own errand, you pass
scathless on. You enter the hut of the dying ; you comfort and
strengthen the quivering soul. It departs to the Great Source it
came from. And then in peace and prayer you retrace your steps,
and sleep the sleep of the good.
But your own heart, my dear young friend, will best find out your
duties. You will feel that every moment of your life must be a
living example to all men. You must feel that your daily actions
are as a mirror by which your flock are to dress their souls: that
your every gesture should be gentle—your every word soft and
sweet even as a note of well-touched music. Your life must be
the active comment on the text you are sworn to, or your life is
naught.
What! is there a man vowed to that text, who, worse than a hire-
ling player, acts his part yet never feels it Does he dress himself
for some brief hour or so, to ape a mission Is his daily life coarse
chaffering ! Is he a swiller at taverns Does he, with embossed
face, tell Cyprian tales, laughing the loudest at his noisome jest? Can
there be such a man, and can he on the seventh day, with unabashed
forehead, tempt God's thunder No—it is impossible. He who
says there is, gently rebuke. Say, “Some enemy hath done this.”
My dear BAsil, I have endeavoured to place before you your duties
as the parish pastor of a flock. Providence may, however, raise you
to the bench. Yes, Basil ; you may become a bishop. Nevertheless,
seek not the dignity; nay, pray that it may never fall upon you. In
your mid-day walks—in your closet—in your bed, let your constant
ejaculation be—Nolo episcopari. Sweet, most sweet, is the humblest
curacy—dangerous and difficult the richest see. How far happier—
how more truly primitive the pastor of a Welsh mountain, than the
bishop of even golden Durham And the bishop—be assured of it
—thinks so.
Nevertheless, I will suppose it your hard destiny to become a
bishop. Power and wealth are poured upon you. Gold trickles in
upon your treasury from a hundred curious crevices – from chinks,
that in sooth might sometimes astonish the fathers. You cannot bless
even so much churchyard clay, but that the clay, like a Potosi mine,
shall render you so much gold. You would be bewildered by your
wealth—you would weep in anguish of spirit at your riches, but
that you always have with you the ignorant to teach—the poor to
succour. Hence, you may with sweetest conscience clutch all the
money you can ; for why? As a bishop, are you not the almoner of
Providence Do not the hungry cluster at your gate 1 Send you
not away the naked clothed and rejoicing Oh what a weight—
a weight dragging the soul to earth would this mammon be, but
that it stays not in the bishop's purse—but that, as the soft-hearted
housewife feeds the winter birds, he scatters abroad his substance to
the wretched and the suffering. Hence, being bishop, you may take
all you can. Of course, you hold it but in trust. Every quarter,
your conscience audits the accounts with Heaven, and you are
serene, are happy in the humble sense of your own righteousness.
Being bishop, you are also law-maker. Beautiful, soul-exalting
mission : You sit in the IHouse of Lords as a Superior Intelligence:
superior by the charity for all men that resides within you ! Hence,
you defile not yourself with politics. The lawn of the bishop is
never, like the coat of Joseph, parti-coloured. The bishop knows no
one side of the human heart. No ; he is for humanity in all its
breadth, and in all its depth. I lence, when lords talk of war, and
tiger looks steal into the eyes of men, the awful bishop rises from
his seat, and with a voice of thunder denounces the abomination
And then with tearful eyes, and with a voice broken with the heart's
spasms, he shows the blasphemy of murderous war—paints in their
own diabolic hues thousands and thousands of drilled and hireling
Cains butchering their brothers And thus the bishop sometimes—
only sometimes—melts the House of Lords !
And now, my dear young friend, I have—though most imperfectly
—laid before you the many blessings which await you in the Church,
which, rightly ministered, is the vestibule to an immortal life. That
you may serve in it with glory to yourself, and with profit to all men,
is the prayer of
Yours affectionately,
SAMUEL of —.
LETTER XXXII.
The ANSWER.
MY DEAR SIR,
It is impossible that I can sufficiently thank you for your
letter. I have been all along in a sad mistake. My family having,
by marriage, a snug thing or two in the Church, I thought it a good
investment of the little talent I may possess. I don't boast of much
—but at a fox-hunt I was never yet out at the death, and at a
steeple-chase never oraned at anything. I therefore thought I might
manage to rub on very well in canonicals; but, really, you have
thrown so many difficulties in my way, that I certainly must give
the clergy the go-bye.
With thanks, however, for your very long letter,
I remain, yours truly,
BAs IL Jolly
P.S. They tell me I’ve the gift of the gab–I think I shall go
to the Bar.

T-
THE VISIT OF THE KING OF THE FRENCH.
THIS truly gratifying event had long been a subject of discussion with the Corporation
of Portsmouth, who on hearing the booming of the guns scampered off to the pier
in their robes and white kid gloves, and awaited with intense anxiety the coming of the
French Monarch.
They had already agreed to an address, in which they anticipate “new aeras; ” pledge
themselves to “lively gratification,” and talk of the advantage “every part of the
habitable globe”—Kamschatka included, of course—will derive from the KING's visit.
It seems that their jurisdiction is bounded on the north by a large pair of wooden gates,
something in the style of the civic sovereignty which is hemmed in by Temple-bar on the
west, and, consequently, the Mayor and Aldermen were compelled to go on board the
royal steamer to present their address, because their authority does not extend beyond
the Royal Clarence yard, expiring, we believe, immediately over the iron grating at the
left-hand corner. The Mayor and Corporation, with the Recorder at their head,
descended the companion-ladder with some difficulty, and were introduced to the KING.
The Recorder made a very low bow, and on rising up again, being a very tall man, he
fetched himself—as the boys say—a most tremendous crack on the head against the beams
of the vessel. Having rubbed his head, he began reading the address, but getting inspired
on arriving at the words “highly important national event,” he drew himself up with
sudden dignity, and “fetched himself” a second most severe wipe—to use a juvenile
expression—which almost brought tears into his own eyes, and a smile into the face
of the Duc DE MonTPENsien. The address, in fact, ran something in this fashion :
—“We, the Mayor (thwack on the head), Aldermen, and Burgesses of the Borough of
Portsmouth (dreadful crack on the pericranium), the loyal and affectionate subjects of
our most gracious Sovereign, Queen Victon IA, desirous of expressing (awful blow on
the temple), the sentiments, &c. &c.”—The address was continued in this style to the
close ; the Recorder, every now and then, rising with his subject, and stooping imme-
diately afterwards with a blow from the top of the cabin. When this was concluded, the
KING gave a very gracious and good-humoured answer, having first joked the Recorder
on the whacks he had received, and apologising for the ship not having been built high
enough to receive so very exalted a personage. The familiarity of the King set the
Corporation off taking liberties, and they began asking him if it was true whether he ever
was a writing-master in England, and advertised specimens of his pupils' improvement
after six lessons :
Louis-PHILIPPE was very good-natured about it, and the Recorder bothered the KING
to write out a copy of the answer to the address, and devote his time to other small ama.
bilities, one of which His Majesty adroitly got rid of by saying that his answer to the
address was only written in his heart, so that the Recorder could not very well request
a lithograph from such an original. The King, however, made up for this disappointment
by offering to shake hands with the whole lot; and they all began tearing away at their
tight-fitting white kid gloves; but his MAJEsty expressed his desire that they would
keep their gloves on--a hint which was not taken by all of them. IIe then good.
naturedly asked them their names and addresses,
when there was a sudden rush of cards, amongst
which we recognised

HIGH S T R EET.
French Rolls at Eight in the Morning.
His Majesty alluded, playfully, to the idea of
the French Rolls, and MR. Johnson suggested
it was better than the Roll of the Drum—a joke
which was judiciously burked by his brother
Aldermen.
At length the Corporation got bowed out, for
the KING had already said, in French, “Ces ercel-
lents messieurs nes'en iront jamais” (“These worthy
fellows will never go”); upon which ADMIRAL
Mackau hoisted unmistakeable signals of dis-
tress, and they were got rid of by a subordi-
nate officer.
It was soon after intimated that PRINCE
ALBERT had arrived; and the Prince jumped
upon deck in that horrible white hat with the
black hatband, which he will wear, followed by
the Duke of WELLINGTon. The meeting of
the PRINcE and KING was very cordial. The
KING's first words were, “Well, here I am ;”
to which Prince ALBERT replied, with great
sincerity, “ Glad to see ye.” WELLINGton
took a sort of sidelong squint at Am M1 RAI.
MAcKAU, as much as to say, “Humph, who are
you, I wonder 2" and MAck Au turned half-round
upon his heel, as though he would have ex-
claimed, “Well, I’m sure : What are you
staring at 1" .
| We now turn our attention to Windsor
Castle, where Her Majesty and suite were in a
state of constant bustle, looking out of the win-
dows, running up and down the stairs, straining
their eyes over the Long Walk, and practising
pretty little speeches to do honour to Louis-
Phill PPE on his arrival. Her Majesty was in
the highest spirits, and jokingly told Sun Rob Enr
PEEL she hoped that he and Mons. Guizor
I would not get talking politics together, and

perhaps proceeding to high words, for she was determined that if
she heard of anything of the sort, Sin Rob ERT must not stop one
moment at the Castle. SIR. Robert PEEL promised to be on his best
behaviour; and with the words, “Not a syllable about Tahiti,” her
Majesty bounded up the great staircase to have another look out
of the top window for her illustrious visitor.
At length the cavalcade hove in sight, and the Queen, who was
the first to catch a glimpse of it, pulled every bell-rope that she went
by, on her way to the grand vestibule. This presence of mind on
the part of the QUEEN had set the entire household agog, and they
all came running towards the foot of the grand staircase, so that a
d tableau was got up in a moment, and Louis-PHILIPPE had an
opportunity of seeing the “whole strength of the company” drawn
up to greet him on his arrival.
When the KING really drove up, her Majesty could not restrain
herself from rushing out to the door of the royal carriage, and the
affectionate words, “Pray go in, you’ll catch cold,” were the first
that were uttered by Louis-PHILIPPE on seeing his hostess without
a bonnet—not even a crown—standing in a thorough draught to
welcome him. PRINCE ALBERT could not refrain from adding,
“I think you’re imprudent, my dear;” but there was no time
for parley or remonstrance, and in a few seconds they were all in
the vestibule kissing each other in all directions. The Duchess of
KENT affectionately clutched in her arms the Duc DE Mont-
PEN.sier ; and after Louis-PHILIPPE and the QUEEN had had a
good hug, the KING or THE FRENch gallantly kissed the Duchess
of KENT.
At length they all started up stairs, and the KING of THE FRENch
was shown to his room, with a request that he would ring for any-
thing he wanted. Dinner wound up the proceedings of the day;
and on Wednesday the KING ran about the slopes with all the
activity of a stripling, and the rest of the day was passed in looking
about the Castle.
Thursday was fixed for trying the char-à-banc, which proved a
dead failure. It jolted awfully, and the number of seats in it pre-
vented that snug gossip with her illustrious visitor, upon which her
Majesty had calculated. It is a sort of “Hampton Court Pleasure
Van,” with the seats placed crossways instead of longways, and
Louis-PHILIPPE saying, “Ah ! I see you don't like it,” playfully
threatened to take it away again. If it is used again, it will only be
in consequence of this banter; and in order to persuade the KING
of THE FRENch that her Majesty is not displeased with his present.
Friday had been the day fixed for investing Louis-Philippe
with the Garter; and the KING, having put on a pair of knee-
breeches, took particular care of his left leg, to keep the stocking
clean for the interesting ceremony. His Majesty looked exceedingly
well in shorts, and appeared extremely proud of his calves, which he
occasionally looked down upon with evident satisfaction.
The Chapter having been summoned for half-past two, the Knights
arrived, and GARTER called them over in the following order.
Garter. Rutland.—Answer. Here am I.
Garter. WELLINGToN.—Answer. Eyes right. Attention. (A laugh.)
The others were called over in their order, and answered to
their names. After a short delay, Louis-PHILIPPE was intro-
duced ; and having been informed that he was elected a Knight
of the Garter, he raised his left leg in the air, resting his toe on
the edge of the table. His stocking was then drawn well up, and
her Majesty, turning her head a little on one side, PRINCE ALBERT
and the Duke of CAMERIDGE secured the stocking by the garter,
which they were about to buckle rather too tightly, when a slight
exclamation burst from the lips of the illustrious monarch. “Too
tight !” inquiringly observed the Duke of CAMBRIDGE. “Un
peu,” replied Louis-PHILIPPE; and the garter was arranged one
hole looser than it had been at first buckled. The riband was
then produced, and the QUEEN was proceeding to place it over the
right shoulder with a complimentary speech, when the DUKE of
CAMBardo E loudly ejaculated “Over the left l” to the utter conster-
nation of all present. Black Rod relieved them from embarrassment
by observing that it was usual to place the riband over the left
shoulder, and the DUKE of CAMBRIDGE exclaiming very loudly,
“That’s what I meant,” the error of her Majesty, in putting it over
the right, was adjusted.
After the ceremony, Louis-PHILIPPE ran to his apartments to get
ready for a drive, and soon made his appearance in an enormous
Mackintosh, which he had thrown on over his garter paraphernalia,
º: he would be compelled to appear again at the evening
nquet.
Windsor was in a state of commotion during the whole day, the
Castle being literally besieged, and every one who came out in regi-
mentals or livery being eagerly followed by the multitude. To cause
a diversion, a few beefeaters were turned out into the quadrangle, to
allay the appetite of the sight-seers. The beefeaters were eagerly
set upon, and seemed in danger of being swamped by the curiosity
of the people, when a lot of Gentlemen-at-Arms were thrust out 3A
a side door, and the populace were thus drawn off from the unfortu-
nate beefeaters, who escaped into their lodging fastnesses. Tha
Gentlemen-at-Arms, being proud of their regimentals, rather liked
being pursued; but ultimately the public got tired out, particularly
when it was discovered that the Gentlemen-at-Arms were only
dressed up to look like deputy-lieutenants, but being, in fact, a lot of
nobodies.
In a short time a glass of wine on a waiter was seen to issue from
one of the side doors, carried by a servant in the royal livery, and
an immense rush was made towards the place to which it was being
taken ; but the servant having entered another door, the wine did
not allay the thirst of the populace for information.
At last the carriages were seen to draw up at the principal en-
trance, but nobody could get near enough to see who got into them,
and nobody could guess which direction the carriages would take;
so that, when they started, the populace ran to all points of the
compass, with a singular difference of opinion as to which way would
be the right one for lighting on the royal cortège. Eventually the
carriages passed out where no one was expecting to see them, and a
lot of loyalty, which had rushed suddenly away from the railings
where nothing was to be seen, turned desperately round a corner,
screaming (whilst several hundred yards from the royal party) a
welcome, which the exertion of running, and the immense distance,
rendered utterly inaudible to its objects.
While we were returning, puffing, blowing, coughing, and wheez-
ing, from our fruitless helter-skelter into the Long Walk, we met
two gentlemen with umbrellas under their arms. One wore a
blue surtout, the other a black long coat, and both were engaged
in quiet conversation; the gentleman in the black coat making a
walking-stick of his umbrella, the individual in blue holding his
parapluie under his left arm, and resting his right hand on about the
centre of it. Our practised eye caught the familiar countenance of
SIR. Rob ERT PEEL, and we recognised in his companion no other
than Guizot. They turned off from the Long Walk towards the left,
and their course was checked for a moment by a stile, when SIR
Rob ERT leading the way, and Guizot following close after, they
both stepped over it, and it occurred to us that the ramble in the
course of which they had easily and pleasantly passed over the
same stile, would do more towards enabling them to get over the
Tahiti and other questions, than all the diplomacy that could ever
pass between them.
PUNCH*S THEATRE.
EALLY desirous that the King of the
FRENch should witness a Shak-
sperian play during his visit to Eng-
land, her Majesty commanded King
John at Sadler's Wells, the only
house at present open for the tragic
drama. Louis-PHILIPPE, like our
own beloved Majesty, has a passion-
ate fondness for the theatre; and
like her Majesty, loses no opportu-
nity of lavishing favours upon its
professors, actors as well as authors.
On Saturday last, the QUEEN, the
KING of THE FRENch, PRINCE
ALBERT, and a select party visited
W). Sadler's Wells, — though not in
state. The distinguished visitors
were received at the door by Messrs. PHELPs and WARNER (dressed
in court suits,) who, carrying superb silver candlesticks, lighted them
to the royal box; which was fitted up in the most tasteful manner;
the arms of England and France being very happily blended in
various-coloured silk velvet.
God sare the Queen was sung, and was immediately followed by the
Parisienne. The play—King John—was immediately begun; and
throughout its performance both their Majesties evinced their admi-
ration by cordially applauding the stern and powerful King John of
MR. PHELPs, and the majestic sorrows of MRs. WARNER's Constance.
On the conclusion of the play, the royal party were again attended
by Messrs. PHELPs and WARNER. Before quitting the box, the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
King of THE FRENch, with a very gracious smile, addressed MR.
Phelps. “It gives me,” said his Majesty, “infinite pleasure to find
that even in the suburbs of London, the mighty genius of the
immortal Shakspere can be so finely illustrated, as I have this night
witnessed it. I am much gratified. Her gracious Majesty will
permit you, MR. PHELPs, to wear this, as a slight token of my admi-
ration of your talent.” Whereupon, Louis-Philippe immediately
handed to Ma. PHELPs the cross of the Legion of Honour.
An immense concourse of spectators had gathered about the
theatre, and the royal carriages drove off amidst acclamations.
THE POLKA
PEST.

the supposed ontein of the polka-
NEARLY twelvemonths ago, Mr. Punch, you must know that I was at
Vienna. There I witnessed the first rise, progress, triumph, and apo-
theosis of the accursed Polka, and learnt it myself in self-defence. After
I was completely sick of it, I went to Paris for the winter, and there, to
my disgust, found that I had to go through the whole process of rise,
progress, triumph, and apotheosis, for the second time. With prophetic
eye I foresaw that in the next London season the whole series would
be inflicted upon me once more; and I need not tell you how right I
was:—and now, sir, that I have gone down into the country, in hopes of
enjoying a little quiet shooting, by Jingol here it is again, just on the
threshold of a vigorous youth, and promising me all the delights of rise,
progress, triumph, and apotheosis, for a fourth time. I can really
scarcely preserve the courteous demeanour for which I am so celebrated,
when I hear the eternal round of questions–Have you seen the Polka?
Have I seen it!!!!) Can you dance the Polka 1–Do you like the
olka!—Do you know the new Polka –Polka–Polka–Polka—Polka–
it is enough to drive one mad! Then, Sir, the way in which these rustics
execute it! That I, who have beheld it, (and performed it, too, not with-
out distinction) in the first salons of Paris and London, should be con-
demned to assist at such an exhibition Two or three couples, who have
been talking big about it for the preceding three weeks, trot with faces of
solemn self-satisfaction round the small circle into which they are hemmed
by the gaping crowd, holding each other at arm's length, and rolling their
heads most religiously from right to left, according to instructions; this
they vary with an occasional attempt at a “toe and heel” step, which
consists in stamping their own heels upon other people's toes, and then
they march away in triumph to receive the congratulations of their friends,
leaving the poor deluded spectators under the impression that they have
seen the Polka. Do, pray, Mr. Punch, throw one of your invisible shells
into the middle of this atrocious nuisance. I ask it on the score of
common humanity, and not on my own account, for I start for Lapland
to-morrow, though, I dare say, I shall find my enemy has preceded me.

THE PRESENTATION OF THE CITY ADDRESS.
Louis-Philippe proved himself a very attentive reader of Punch by what
he said to the civic folks on Saturday last; and two or three of the coups
de pat with which he favoured Magnay and Moon, would almost tempt us
to offer his Majesty terms to join us in the character of a contributor.
The King of the FRENch indulged in two jokes of the most extravagantly
humorous kind. He actually complimented MAGNAY on his father's hos-
pitality, and told Moon he knew him well, having heard of “his encourage-
ment of the arts.” Magnay's hospitality, and Moon's encouragement of
the arts, have long been two of the standing jokes of this periodical, which,
it is evident, Louis-Philippe gets smuggled over into France for his own
private reading, though publicly professing to prohibit it.
We understand that Magnay winced perceptibly; but Moon, who is not
easily made to blush, faced out his Majesty's pleasantry with characteristic
hardihood.
Magnay's invitation to the King to come and dine at the Mansion
House would have been inexplicable, but for the fact that the Lond Mayor
was perfectly aware of his Majesty's intention not to visit London. A
chuckle was observed to pass over the countenance of Louis-PHILIPPE, as
much as to say, “it would be a good joke to take him at his word;” but
his Majesty good humouredly spared Magnay from the state of nervous-
ness into which he would have been thrown by the slightest apprehension
that he might be called upon to entertain the French sovereign.
The people at the palace appear to have been quite in the humour for
quizzing the citizens; and poor MR. LAMBent Jones got a dig at the door
of the outer chamber from the Duke of WELLINgron. The Duke, having
no doubt the recollection of poor Jones's rebuff vividly in his mind,
exclaimed, “By-the-by, Jones, do you know when her Majesty intends to
have the ceremony of opening the Royal Exchange performed?”, Poor
Jones could only say he knew nothing at all about it; and, considering
that the Queen declined seeing him when he called at Windsor on the
subject, we hardly know how Jones could have given a more satisfactory
answer.
Altogether the citizens were what is commonly termed “rigged” most
unmercifully, probably as a warning to any other corporations that may
feel disposed to interfere with the privacy of Louis-Philippe's visit, by
publicly addressing him.

THE STUDENTS GRATITUDE TO GRAHAM.
By a number of rejected Medical Students a very respectable meeting was yesterday
held in the Lecture Room of a certain large hospital, for the purpose of voting an
address of thanks to SIR JAMEs GRAHAM, for the Medical Reform Bill which he means
to introduce next session.
The chair (namely, the Anatomical Teacher's,) was taken by MR. Ports, of Guy's,
who, considering that he had been plucked at the Hall three times, was unanimously
determined the fittest person to occupy it.
A young gentleman in a Tweed wrapper, with a stick projecting from the side pocket,
whose name, we understand, was Faker, rose to move the address. He commenced by
claiming, in the usual terms, indulgence for his inexperience as an orator; and then,
plunging in medias res, declared his conviction that SiR JAMEs GRAHAM was a brick.
He (MR. FARER, not SIR JAMEs GRAHAM) had had the honour of º plucked.
(Cheers.) He considered that it was an honour. (Renewed cheering.) He might
have passed, if he had agreed with the examiner about bleeding in Apoplexy. The
examiners were unfair. (Hear, hear 1) He had been floored by a catch question.
(Shame 1) They had bullied him. (Groans and hisses.) They had asked him the
composition of Calomel. He happened to have forgotten it; anybody might. (Hear,
hear 1) Then they got him on Materia Medica; and he (MR. FAKER) was sure that
every gentleman present well knew that this was a subject that nobody could get up
thoroughly. The fact was, that they took a delight in rejecting a fellow. . (Groans.)
To ruin a young man's prospects was a pleasure to them. It was their object. They
were a set of brutes, (hear, hear 1) old women, (hear, hear, hear 1) humbugs. (Tre-
mendous cheering.) They would now be done up. (Hurrah!). Sir JAMEs. GRAHAM's
Bill would settle them. No more Hall ! No more grinding ! No more waiting in that
“funking room l’’ (Cries of capital t and glorious !). He should now say no more,
as he was tired, and should like some half-and-half; but would at once propose the
resolution; which was to the following effect:-
“That this Meeting begs, on the part of Medical Students as a body, to express its
gratitude to the Ri i. Honourable SiR JAMEs GRAHAM for his intended measure of
Medical Reform, and especially for that part of it which will enable them to practise
without passing any examinations.”
The gentleman in the Tweed wrapper sat down amid immense cheering.
The Address was seconded, in a neat and characteristic speech, by a MR. Nibbs,
who strongly insisted on the point that Chemistry was gammon.
A student of the name of Dobson suggested as an amendment to the Address the
following addition:—
“And this Meeting considers the Right Honourable Baronet a trump.”
MR. Tucker, a University College man, seconded the amendment.

A MR. Jones perfectly coincided with the last gentleman, and wished anybody would
tell him what good it did to get up Pharmacy
Another student expressed his disapprobation of Latin.
his Celsus, and thought it a great shame.
A desultory conversation followed on the inutility of knowledge in general; at the
end of which the amended resolution was put and carried by an immense majority: after
which the company adjourned, in parties, to various subterranean taverns, with the
exception of MR. Jones, who expressed his determination of

PU N C H
To Messieurs les Rédacteurs of the “Constitutionnel.”
the “Quotidienne,” and the “Siècle.”
My ExcelleNT BUT Incomprehensible BRothers,
What does possess you? Here have we English
been fussing our hearts out to do honour to France in the
person of her Sovereign. SIR PETER LAURIE has distinctly
stated that he has the very highest respect for Louis
Philippe. MR. Moon, and the excellent members of the
Common Council, were treading on each other's toes in
their anxiety to present him with a loving address from
the City of London, while everybody at Windsor (though
I don't lay so much stress on this) from the Queen
downwards vied in attention to our illustrious guests.
Even I, Punch, who had the best excuse for sulking,
when the King presented himself, have actually embraced
the man who exiled me from France. And yet you are
not satisfied. You will find an insult in every attention,
a dagger in every word of congratulation, a thrusting of
the tongue into the cheek in every look of welcome.
Really you expend a monstrous deal of ingenuity in flinging
dirt into your own faces. Do you always behave so? Is
it a natural tendency of yours to suppose everybody wants
to insult you, to rake up the ashes of every old heart-
burning, and rummage your histories for every recollec-
tion of defeat, that you may have the pleasure of saying—
“and these are the courtesies of Albion : " Upon my
sacred honour, as a great moral engine, I’m ashamed of
you. Take Punch's word for it, John Bull is the best-
natured, simplest creature in the world. As for deeply-
plotted insults, and far-fetched gibes, he hasn't a notion
of them—he hates them—he sums up his detestation of
them when he calls them “Un-English.”
In sending the Duke of WELLINGron to receive Louis-
PHILIPPE at Portsmouth, he hadn't a thought of the battle
of Waterloo; and in setting out dinner in the Waterloo
Gallery, depend upon it the Comptroller of the House-
hold was thinking of the book of precedence rather than
the treaty of Versailles; and as for the cheers that
greeted MARSHAL Soult on his late visit, they were the,
simple recognition of a brave enemy—but by no means of
a beaten Frenchman. If he had thrashed the Duke, his
reception would have been just the same. I know you
don't believe a word I say, but I must tell the truth,
nevertheless. Do think and talk more like men and
sensible men, or your own countrymen will laugh at you.
I am accustomed to be laughed at, and like it; but for a
serious newspaper, the laugh of its “constant readers” is
fatal. Your annoyed brother,

PERFIDIOUS ALBION.

Jeune France for one moment imagine
such an atrocity—the Duke of WEL-
LINGTon, who, with his English gold,
bought the battle of Waterloo, he who
brought back the Bourbons over the
slaughtered bodies of Frenchmen, he,
above all other men, was despatched
by QUEEN Victon 1A to welcome to
Portsmouth the King of THE FRENch !
And Louis-PHILIPPE shook him by
the hands – yes, one hand was not
enough—but, hear it France, and let
the ashes of NApol EoN stir with
indignation,--he shook him by both
hands !
[From the Siècle.]
What was it necessary for the full accomplishment of our
degradation that the KING of THE FRENch should be feasted in
the Hall of Waterloo in Windsor Castle? A hall, decorated with
the portraits of men who have outraged France—who have spilt the
blood of her children Had not M. Guizot sufficiently degraded
the unfortunate country which mourns his administration, but that
with a smile upon his cheek—yes, a smile traitorous to ourselves and
our institutions—he must walk in Windsor Park with the man PEEL

with Peel in the Home Park I Why does not all France, leaping
from its lethargy, chant the Marseillaise and grasp the sword
[From the Globe.]
The least that France could expect of the Duke of WELLINgroN,
during the visit of Louis-Philip PE to Windsor, was decent
behaviour. Much, from the character of the man, could not be
expected. No : the man who had been base enough to corrupt the
traitors who sold their hapless country, the man who with accursed
gold bought the battle of Waterloo, was not likely to make any large
sacrifice to decency. Nevertheless, the least to be expected of him
was, that during Louis PHILIPPE’s visit, he would remain within
his own doors. Certainly, it was not to be expected that he would
have had the audacity to approach the King of THE FRENch !
Had he possessed the true delicacy of a hero, he would on the sudden
have fallen very ill, and kept his bed until the KING had departed.
Such sensibility, however, does not dignify a Wellington. No :
on the contrary, even before the FRENch King had touched the
hateful soil of Albion, WELLINGton was on board the Gomer; and
what is more—as the English prints audaciously declare it—“ look-
ing in excellent health and spirits : " But France—whilst the man
of Ghent reigns—is doomed to be insulted.
Provincial Intelligence.
Our Herne Bay Correspondent has written to inform us that one of
the two policemen has resigned, in consequence of a row with the pier-
master. This must have been expected, for it was utterly impossible
that a civil and military despotism could long co-exist without a
collision.
The Bay is now at the mercy of anybody who chooses to take any
trouble about the matter. We should be wrong to endeavour to lull the
inhabitants into a consciousness of security, when we know that there is
no force in the place sufficient to check the insolence of any invading
squadron. It is fortunate that the pier-master is not a BRUAT, nor the
policeman E PRIrchand. If one had been the one, and the other the
other, we might have had the Tahiti business over again before we knew
exactly where we were, or where events were leading us. The pier-
master has, however, reprimanded himself, and the policeman having
cesigned, the Gordian knot is cut—at least for the present.
STARTLING AND MOST IMPORTANT INTELLIGENCE.

“SIR PETER LAURIE entertains the highest respect for the King of
THE FREnch.”—Not only does SIR PETER LAURIE thus honour. His
Majesty Louis Philippe, but gives us his most exquisite reason for it
—What do you think it is, O Public Guess
Is it because Louis Philippe has shown himself determined to main-
tain peace between England and France Bagatelle :
Is it because he supported exile with courage and self-reliance, and
elevation to a throne with dignity Mere acting 1
Is it because he has just released some fifty or sixty prisoners of state
from the dungeons of St. Michael Policy
Is it—? but we might fill our number with probable reasons: It is for
none of these things that SIR PETER LAURIE respects Louis Philippi.
It is—

wards A MonARch, who, when AskED BY THE MAYor of PortsMoUril
FoR A copy of The REPLY OF HIS MAJESTY TO THE ADDRESS PRESENTED
to HIM By the corporation of that Town, SAID, “I HAVE No copy ;
It is writteN IN MY HEART l’.”
And this, O Public, is the reason why SIR PETER LAURIE respects the
King of the French.
SIR ANDREW AGNEW AGAIN.
To the EARL of ABERDern.
Nº AM right well pleased, my Lord, to learn that during
Her Majesty's late visit to Blair Athol, she com-
ported herself with every deference towards the
feelings of the most religious, the most moral, and
the most delicate-minded people on the face of the
earth, need I say, my Lord, that I allude to our
inestimable countrymen ;
I was most satisfied with the deportment of the
QUEEN at Church, and, though I trust I have the
humility of a superfine Christian, I cannot but
attribute the pious behaviour of Her Majesty to
= the influence of the letter which you had the
honour to receive from me on Her Majesty's arrival
- in happy and religious Scotland.
I assure you, although it was not generally known, I watched Her
Majesty pretty closely. I felt that all Scotland required such
vigilance of me. Hence, I attended the Church, and, by the aid of a
strong pocket telescope, was enabled to watch every movement of
the Royal countenance during the service. Not for one minute did
I have my eye off the Queen. As I have said I thought the country
required this of me.
I also made it my business to inquire of the servants at the
Castle as to the deportment of Her Majesty in her private hours;
and, altogether, must express myself very well satisfied with her
conduct. PRINCE ALBERT is, I think, a well-disposed young man,—
but on his next visit to our beloved country, he will, I trust, show a
better respect towards the feelings of the most religious, the most
moral, and the most delicate-minded people on the face of the earth,
by not whistling to his dog on a Sunday.
The Princess Royal is a very pretty little child, but I would rather
not see her smile so much on the Sabbath. She is, however, but a
child, and may be instructed out of this dangerous levity. May I
also suggest that the next time the Queen visits a Scotch Church,
she should not wear roses in her bonnet. Roses on a Sunday are
scarcely proper—a bit of riband I think quite sufficient.
Altogether, however, I am very well satisfied with Her Majesty,
and think that Scotland will be in no danger from the Sabbath
example set by the QUEEN. Hence, I shall be very glad to hear of
Her Majesty's coming among us another season, and am-
Your well-wisher and adviser,
ANDREw AgNEw.
Consumption of Meat in Isondon.
Last week the consumption of Butcher's Meat at the Mansion House
was 6 chump chops, 2 lbs. of gravy beef, 3 lbs. of suet, 1scrag of mutton, and
3 lb. of calf's liver... Compared with the corresponding week of the pre-
ceding year this exhibits a falling off of 48 quarters cf lamb, 30 shoulders,
18 legs, and 20 haunches of South Down mutton, 13 sirloins, 17 fillets of
veal, and 100 lbs. of rump steak. This alarming difference has quite
created a panic among the Aldermen in the City.

OMISSIONS OF THE COURT CIRCULAR.
The gentleman whose duty it is to concoct the Court Circular is, in
sooth, a strange forgetful person—a man of marvellous short memory.
The blunders committed by him—the omissions of which he has been
guilty—during the visit of the King of the French, have, however,
exceeded all previous errors. He has duly given the names of Dukes,
and Marquises, and Ambassadors, and so forth, honoured by a command
to the royal table, but he has in no one instance chronicled any name of
the host of poets, philosophers, painters, authors, musicians, sculptors, and
other professional men who were expressly invited that Louis-Philippe
might see the representatives of much of the intellect of the country.
What is the man of the Court Circular about ! It would almost seem
that he has so long attended to the mere doings of a palace, that he has a
. grudge against intellect. We trust he will be more attentive for
the future.

ACCIDENT ON THE KENSINGTON RAILWAY.
The up and down train, which keeps running up and down the line to
make believe there's a passenger, had just left the Kensington station
with its usual freight of enginemen, stokers, and policemen, when the
train was overtaken by a man running at a pretty smart pace after it.

ing such a thing possible, called to the stoker to stop, but the stoker sup-
| posing the policeman only wanted to get down, and cut a salad for supper
as he had frequently done before, no attention was paid to the summons.
Ultimately the engineer, being desirous of going home, stopped the engine,
and it was then ascertained that the train had passed over two horses,
without either stoker, policeman, or engineer having known anything
about it. The unfortunate horses had, it seems, broken away from a
| groom, and the sagacious animals having observed the very little traffic
on the line, thought there could be no possible danger in indulging in a
| scamper down it. The unfortunate beasts were, however, out in their

THE QUEEN'S VISIT TO THE CITY.
THE following will be as nearly as possible the ar-
* rangements on the occasion of Her Majesty's going
to open the Royal Exchange, on the 28th instant :-
Her Majesty and PRINcE ALBERT are to be at
Temple Bar (the western boundary of the civic do-
minions) at exactly twelve o'clock ; and the Lond
Mayor, with the civic functionaries, will be standing
on the other side of the closed gate an hour previously,
taking it by turns to look through the key-hole, so as
to be aware of the precise moment of the arrival of
the royal visitors. The hairdresser's shop, which forms
part of the gateway, will be blockaded by a strong
police force, so as to prevent the Corporation from
being surprised, and the proprietor will be compensated
by the price of six “easy shaves,” as an equivalent
for what he will lose by the interruption to his usual
routine of rasping the chins of the public.
A Herald will then kick at the gate, and ring the
top bell in the name of the Queen, while Stick-in-
Waiting will give a rap at the door, and Herald-in-
Ordinary will give a severe blow to his trumpet. The
LoRD MAYon will then exclaim through the key-hole,
“Who are you ?” and TANNER the hair-dresser will go
through a piece of pantomime at his window expressive
of the sentiment that he would let them through the
shop if he could, but that he really can’t, and he will
make signs implying an uncertainty as to where his
allegiance is due, pointing first towards the Lond
Mayon, then towards the Queen, and ultimately
taking refuge under his own counter, leaving the two
sovereigns to arrange the matter between them. Stick-
in-Waiting will then put his mouth to the key-hole,
exclaiming, “Open in the Queen's name 1” when
Magnay will draw the bolt, the gates will be un-
closed, and he will rush out with two pantomime keys,
supposed to be the keys of the city, which he will hand
to Her Majesty, who will immediately hand them back
again.
The whole party will then proceed to the New Ex-
change, where the Gresham Committee will be in
attendance under the portico; the Chairman having
previously been voted on to the top step, to enable
him to preside over the meeting, the ordinary mem-
bers occupying the street posts, kerb-stone, and other
accommodations, until the arrival of Her Majesty. The
Gresham Committee will all start upon their legs when
the Queen appears in sight, and will receive her on
her arrival, the Chairman stammering out something
about “British Commerce; ” the Queen alluding, in
reply, to the connection between the House of Bruns-
wick and the London Merchants. Her Majesty will
then be conducted into the area, across the open court,
up the principal staircase to the building appropriated
to Lloyd's, when she will probably express a wish to
see Lloyd, whose celebrated list she has heard so much
about.
The Queen will then pass into the apartments de-
voted to the Royal Exchange Assurance Company,
which it is expected Her Majesty will open by laying
the first insurance—that is to say, taking out the first
policy in the new office in favour of the royal apiary.
Her Majesty will, it is understood, not wear the splendid
badges of the orders of the County Fire Office and the
Phoenix, in both of which some of the furniture at
Windsor is insured, but she will present the company
with the insignia that will in future be placed on all the
buildings insured in it. A banquet will be announced
at two, to which Her Majesty will be conducted, and
the corporation will then proceed to the discussion of
the real matters of interest connected with the day's
proceedings.
Such are the arrangements as far as we can at pre-
sent ascertain them, from the mysterious programme
which has been put forth; but as the citizens are very
liable to be confused when they come to carry out their
own intentions, it is possible there will be a few devia-
tions from the path already chalked out. Punch having
received an invitation to the banquet and the rest of
the day's proceedings, will not ſail to give a true
account of them.

aide-de-camp. RAMo SAMEE will be ap-
pointed his guard of honour and parasol-
bearer.
1847.-The PRESIDENT of THE UNITED
STATEs. He will not lodge at the Palace,
however, on account of his republican
principles, but simply have a knife and
fork laid for him at the royal table every
day. The North, and South American
Coffee-house will have a handsome second-pair back fitted up for him.
1848.-The SULTAN of TuRKEY, who, out of compliment to the Queen,
will not smoke under her hospitable roof, but will take his dozen cheroots
every evening at GLIDDoN's Cigar Divan.
1849.-The KING of the CANNIBAL IsLANDS. LoRD BRough AM has been
appointed interpreter to His Majesty; and Colonel Rowan, of the Blues,
ordered to wait upon him.
1850.-The EMPERoR of CHINA, who will preside at the Royal Agricul-
tural Association, and compete with PRINCE ALBERT in prize pigs. The
EMPERoR's royal relations, the Sun, Moon, and the Stars, will travel night

will be received by the Lord Chamberlain, and shown to the door by
Inspector MALLALIEU. His Majesty's visit will be very short.
S O A P 1
A short Essay By one of THE “good old school.”
Within the last few days meetings have been held for the
purpose of establishing baths—cheap baths—wherein the laborious
poor may cleanse and refresh themselves. The Bishop of London,
the Lord Mayor, and other respectable people, have advocated the
measure. Poor ignorant enthusiasts—unconscious revolutionists
What? Is there, then, to be no distinction among men Are all
the sons of Adam to wear clean faces? Are we no longer to refresh
our sense of superiority with a sight of begrimed countenances—no
longer to feel proud of our own dainty anatomies in the knowledge
that the low working people about us are coated with dirt Is this,
the last distinction of decent society, to be destroyed—washed out !
It was bad enough when velvet and gold lace were given up, and
the true gentleman had to be picked out by his conduct, and not by
his coat. This, to a man who really loved the institutions of his
country, was certainly bad enough. But, nevertheless, there yet
remained one, as it seemed, ineffaceable mark of inferiority—one
lasting badge of serfdom—namely, dirt. And we are to sap the
constitution of society by destroying this most valuable social ingre-
dient We are to throw cold and tepid water on it !
When we called certain folks the “great unwashed,” did we not,
in our contemptuous raillery, shew our superior condition ? The
“unwashed ” was the dirty, defiled ADAM ; a thing of the earth,
earthy—a low creature. On the contrary, we stood as upon a
pedestal, upon our soap, and looked loftily about us with a sense of
the blessings of water. We were the washed; and, being so, were
therefore the elect of the earth. The “unwashed ” were of a lower
species—the mere negroes of poverty -
And now all men are to have cheap baths 1 Well, there is an end
to really good society, when butchers, dyers, even coal-heavers, are
all—all—“warranted to wash : *

MISERY AMONG THE FLOWERS.
Esthen Pience, another pallid victim of the needle, was charged
at Worship-street with illegal pawning. Yes—famine took her to
the pawnbroker with the goods of a MR. John HALDEN, of 6, Bread-
street, Cheapside. Est HER PIERcE was employed to embroider a
silk shawl with flowers—with no less than eighty silken blossoms—
for the sum of sixpence 1 . Well, this was a hard day's work; bring-
ing something less than a halfpenny an hour. The young woman had
neither food nor drink; and so, with misery and famine at her heart
—in the very despair of biting hunger—she took MR. John HAL-
DEN's property to the pawnbroker. She is urged, tempted—sorely
tempted beyond the power of suffering nature to withstand—to com-
mit crime, to make herself a felon, by the miserable wages awarded
her by the tradesman of Bread-street, Cheapside. Bread-street 1–
There is a cruel irony even in the address.
There is a society—all-honoured be its object—for the relief and
conversion of miserable young women, cast like weeds upon the
world; for the wretched Magdalen, despised, outraged, degraded.
This society calls with a voice of comfort to the defiled creature, and
teaches her, in goodly season, modesty, self-respect. She is snatched
from daily, hourly perdition, and restored to the decencies of life.
She is no longer an animal, cursed with a soul. All praise be to the
institution that works this goodness.
Yet, surely we think, the Principle of Wickedness must grin and
hug itself at the gatherings of this society—must chuckle, as the
devil only chuckles—when the secretary, with grave face and self-
complacent tone, reads the number of victims saved — of brands
snatched from the fire—and turned to worthy uses. We say, this
same Wickedness must laugh at the small, retail humanity of such an
institution, when, as in mockery of it, there are thousands and thou-
sands of young women tortured by the injustice of the world, by its
mercenary, heartless tasking, into a life of infamy. A feeble phi-
lanthropy saves indeed a few wretches; but then there is a Giant
Injustice—iron-hearted son of avarice and trade—that drives his
crowds into the street; that makes them in a wild despair of heart—
for bread, horrid bread indeed so purchased—bind themselves to
agony and shame ! How many fall—how many, with heroic serenity
of soul, their wounds bleeding inwardly, pine from day to day—and
at length wither from the earth, no more accounted of than autumn
flies And now and then some haggard, white-lipped creature—
some famishing Esth ER PIERCE for the sake of a meal dares New-
gate and the doom of a felon. And so it will be, until throughout all
society it shall be preached—not meekly mouthed, but preached with
a terrible, soul-smiting energy, that there are holier things than
pounds and shillings; that human souls are in very truth of more
account than Bank paper.
Est HER PIEncE—our readers will rejoice at it—escaped prison,
the benevolent pawnbroker (we should have liked to chronicle his
name) giving up the shawl without payment—the shawl which con-
tained the eighty flowers, worked for sixpence In the East, they
have a well-known way of arranging flowers that, like words, they
may discourse a passion. Alas! what a story may the eye of pity
read in these eighty flowers, worked for a tester. On the one hand,
what cruel, selfish, iron-hearted tasking ! On the other, what misery
—what weariness of life—what utter blankness of all that should
comfort and sustain toiling humanity
We should like to know the particular eighty flowers worked for
sixpence by Est HER PIERcE for John HALDEN. Is it possible that
for such a tradesman any of them could be heart's-ease ?
MR. HALDEN, in a letter to the Times, says, that “he gives consi-
derably more than sixpence” for such work ; but then, with the
diffidence of genuine liberality, he does not specify how much
In Ore.
MR. HALDEN also observes that the wretched story of Est HER
PIERCE is “calculated to do him serious injury.” We do not think
it unlikely.
In conclusion, however, we would say to all wholesale dealers in
embroidered shawls, give something more to female toil than six-
pence for eighty flowers. Something more, considerate masters . So
that whilst your wretched slaves are working flowers, your own con-
sciences may not—for the after time—be working nettles.
Q.
ExTREME SIMPLICITY.
MR. O'Connell, in a late letter to the Repeal Association, distinguishes
between “Federalists” and “Simple Repealers.” . We understand, by
the latter class, all those who are simple enough to subscribe to the “Rint.”

We have had several inquiries addressed to us as to what has become of
LoRD BRough AM. We have no means of knowing with certainty how his Lordship
is at present occupied, but it is not impossible that his success as clown to the
ring during the last parliamentary campaign has induced him to seek during the
recess a similar situation in the provinces. We know that there are several
equestrian companies traversing the country at this period of the year, and we
have heard of a very clever clown in MR. Cooke's employ, who jumps through a
hoop on the back of a horse at full gallop. Can it be Lond BRough AM 2
A G REAT WA L N UT CAS E.
“And oh, it was nuts for the devil to crack!”-Moore.
AMong other odd theories, we have one, that some men were never children
—that, if we except their size at the time of their birth, they were in all other
respects adults; mentally full-grown ; he-MINER was, albeit for a period doomed
to long clothes and swaddling bands. “Colonel H. D. CAMPBell, of North-
End, near Kingston, Portsea,” must we think be one of these privileged beings.
IIe, it is plain, from the short newspaper history we are about to quote, was
never a boy. He has known nothing of the temptations of childhood-life in the
shape of walnuts “hanging over a garden wall.”
Before the solemnity of a Portsmouth tribunal was “a little boy, named
John HoARE,” arraigned for knocking three walnuts “of the value of one
farthing” off the branch of a tree, the property of the aforesaid Colonel
CAMPBELL. The culprit had been abetted in his iniquity by three other boys.
Two of them escaped, but the third, for the ends of justice, was induced to
turn himself inside out as Queen's evidence. John HoARE, however, evidently
bronzed in crime, pleaded guilty to the charge. Whereupon, the little walnut
ruffian was sentenced to be “imprisoned and kept to labour fourteen days.”
This appalling story is very pithily related in the Hampshire Independent, from
which we gather the further comforting intelligence that the police are keeping
a sharp look out for the two escaped criminals, “in order to bring them to
justice 1” Happy is Hampshire in such a police “Oh, Justice,” cried the
French patriot, “what tomfoolery, what wickedness is often done in thy
name !”
We think our readers—at least some of them—will now accord in our
theory, that there are men who have never been boys; and that stern lovers
of justice, like unto Colonel CAMPBELL, are among the privileged. Other-
wise, the Colonel, remembering his school-boy days, when apples smiled at
him from over a wall—when walnuts, audible to his heart, cried “knock me
down”—would have rebuked, or angrily shook his fist at the offending John
HoARE, or have threatened him with horsewhipping, but, certainly, with a
thought of the frailty of the flesh of boyhood in the matter of fruit hanging
over a wall, he would not have pursued little John to the
treadmill for a loss of the value of one farthing. Yes; we
think it plain that the valorous soldier was never in reality
a child. Perhaps, indeed, he may be the identical warrior
of whom the well-known story is told that “the Colonel
was crying for his porridge.”
† The stern Lond ELDoN, in his old age—even when he
had become hardened in ermine—looked indulgently at
school-boy apple-stealing; for he somewhere says of him-
self and brother, “we were very good boys; we never did
worse than rob an orchard.” But then Lond ELDoN had
been once a boy He had—shall we call it so—the advan-
tage of Colon EL CAMPBELL.
John HoARE will, however, gain experience. After
fourteen days retirement in gaol, he may come out with a
contempt of the pettiness of his offence — instead of
knocking down walnuts he may learn to steal handker-
chiefs and pick locks.
...We think the county of Hampshire should in some way
mark its gratitude to Colon EL CAMPBELL. The whole
Iliad, it is said, was once so minutely written that it could
be enclosed in a walnut-shell. Let the same ingenuity be
exercised on the Newgate Calendar, and then be presented,
with grateful solemnity, to “Colonel H. D. CAMPBELL,
of North-End, near Kingston, Portsea 1"
THE HONOURABLE ARTILLERY COMPANY.
At a Court of Assistants of the above Honourable Company, it
was resolved unanimously —
1st. That the members be strictly ordered not to put on
their clean shirts on Sunday, but save them till Monday, as it
would be a disgrace to the Service to appear with dirty collars.
2nd. That Privates be not allowed to have straps at the
bottom of their trousers; and those Members whose trousers
are too short, are ordered to have their boots blacked well up
the legs.
3rd. That the Members be ordered to attend particularly to
their Caps; the Court of Assistants having noticed, with regret,
the very rusty appearance of the beaver, which can be reno-
vated at a small expense.
4th. That the Armourer be ordered to take off the locks of
the muskets, to prevent any accident.
5th. That the Captains be instructed to arrange all the
short men in front, so that the taller men may look over their
heads without standing on tip-toe.
6th, and last. It is earnestly requested, that the whole regi-
ment will be careful not to tread on each other's heels; and
none but Officers will be allowed to wear eye-glasses or
spectacles.
By Order of the Court,
W. White, Secretary.
THE RING OF THE FRENCH AND THE CITIZENS.
Louis-Philippe has quite enchanted the Corporation by his
urbanity, though his confounding SIR CLAudius HUNTER with
SIR PETER LAURIE proves that the impression created by the
latter was somewhat of an evanescent character. The answer
to the address of the City is, it seems, not to be simply copied
in the ordinary ink of every-day life, but it is to be engraved, so
that every one of the Corporation may have a copy of it. We
understand that the copy is to be carefully made from the
original in the heart of SIR PETER LAURIE, who has solemnly
declared that the address is engraved there, and will continue
to be engraved there as long as the proprietor of the engraving
is in existence.
Advertisement for Tongues."
A CERTAIN “Y. Z.” of Wandsworth, advertizes in the
Times for “an active young woman who can speak French
and work well at her needle, as Housemaid, in a small family.”
A small touch of Chinese and Arabic would, of course, not be
objectionable. We may next expect an advertisement for
“a getter up of fine linen, who can, use the Italian iron, and
read DANTE.”
Nothing SURPRIsiNg. – We regret to hear that Louis-
Philippe suffered dreadfully, during the night he spent at
Dover, from the night-mare. His medical attendants attri-
buted it to apprehension of the visit from the corporation at
day-break.

THE GRASSHOPPERS’ FEAST.

ºs RAY come, call your cabs, and away, And there came the Wasp on his versatile wing,
one and all, Who assails friend and foeman alike with his sting,
The Queen BurtERFLY opens the The Wasp of the North, with perpetual hum,
GRAsshoppers' HALL ; Whom nothing can ever persuade to be dumb:
* The trumpeter civic has summoned Then a crowd of strange creatures, of every size,
~& the crew, Of all kinds of shapes, and of all sorts of dyes;
And Her Majesty can't be kept wait- State Locusts were there upon pensions that gorge,
ing for you.” Fine birds with fine feathers; Bath, Thistle, and George ;
So squeaked MR. Punch, and no sooner had said, Creeping things of the Earth that wind up the back-stairs,
Than his merry Contributors after him sped ; And Spiders that spread in the Law Courts their snares,
And on the smooth pavement, the kerb-stone beside, Grave Owls of the Bench with significant looks,
Beneath a tall lamp-post, the storm that defied, Parliamentary Jack-daws and clerical Rooks.
Saw the Children of Rank and the Tenants of Place Duke PEAcock was there and Lord TURKEY.cock too,
Repair with their presence the gala to grace In orders and ribands, green, yellow and blue.
Of the Grasshopper princes of portly renown, The Lobster his brother the SEA-CRAB brought there,
Good liegemen and true to the BUTTERPly's crown. Who promised for once not to swagger nor swear;
And there were the Grasshoppers standing in files, The Political RAT had crept out of his hole,
Their jolly round faces all beaming with smiles: And walked in by the side of RED TAPist, the Mole;
City Marshal, Remembrancer, Chamberlain big, And GRUB the old Tory, fat, burly and big
And the Chaplain with gown, and Recorder in wig; Came crawling before CATERPILLAR, the Whig.
And there, with his mace, stood the Mace-bearer stout, So thus they all enter'd, the great and the small,
And the bold Lumber Troopers, rigg’d famously out. And the BUTTERFly open'd the Grasshoppers' Hall.
The windows were crowded, the balconies crammed, She wished them prosperity, health, and success;
Poor ladies were jostled, fat gentlemen jamm'd; And the Grasshoppers thank'd her; they couldn't do less.
And the banners, drums, trumpeting, cannon, and cheers, If they clipp'd the Queen's English a little ; what then
Would have dazzled your eyes and confounded your ears. Your Grasshoppers ne'er talk exactly like men ;
First came the Queen Burreafly, fairer ne'er ſlew, If they “put their foot in it,” as some people say,
O., a moss-rose to breakfast off nectar and dew ; Why isn't that always the Grasshoppers' way :
Her Majesty looked so remarkably well, If they bunglingly managed or awkwardly spoke,
That she seem'd to be fresh from her chrysalis shell. The mistake only tended to heighten the joke.
The Grasshoppers' Chief, with his courtliest speech, The Burterfly fluttered her pinions with glee;
Helped her up the Hall steps with a rev'rence at each ; The Goose cackled blithely the pageant to see ;
And with equal profusion of smiles and of bows, The WATERLoo Cock crowed aloud with delight ;
The next in command did the like by her spouse. And the SNARE hiss'd his pleasure as well as he might ;
Her spouse, the Moth Consort, renown'd for his HAt, The GRAsshoppers' chirrup was noisy as gay,
(Though we’re happy to say that he didn't wear tha'); And the WASP, for once, buzzed in a good-humour'd way.
Then the Ministers came, and the Lordlings that sport, A Sinail, one Sir PETER, was said to advance
Gay creatures of air, in the BUTTERFLY's Court. And offer to end the affair with a dance,
And there came the gallant old Chanticleer, who But the uproar was such that he pull'd in his head ;
Won the main that came off upon famed Waterloo; “And now,” said the Queen, “we’ll adjourn to the “spread'.”
And there was the Goose, waddling in on his legs, “Home, too, let us hasten, my boys, for d'ye see,
First Lord of the Treasury's rich golden eggs : A dinner waits also for you and for me."
And there crept the SNAke, all so cunning and sly, So squeak"d MR. Punch, and retracing their track,

LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER XXXIII.
FROM A YOUNG MAN ENTERING BUSINESS TO A RETIRED
TitadeSMAN.
Respected SIR,
WHEN we last met, you were
kind enough to say that the benefit of
your long experience in business should
be always at my service; and that as the
friend of my poor late father, it would
always be a pleasure to you to advise his
son. At the same time you desired me to
give you my notions of the duties of a tradesman to the world and
to himself, that you might at the onset correct my errors, and
strengthen my judgment. I therefore hasten to comply with your
request.
Of course, sir, I consider the old schoolboy copy that “Honesty is
the best Policy” to be the golden rule of life, and that the shortest
way from one point to another is always in a straight line. Hence, it
will ever be my pride to let my practice illustrate this beautiful sen-
timent. I do not see why a shop may not be made a temple of truth
—and cannot understand why a falsehood “in the way of business”
is not, after all, a falsehood in all its bearings. Lies are lies, and no
outside, skin-deep gilding will give to the base metal the value of the
precious ore. I have, I am sorry to say, known tradesmen with
great wrathfulness mail a proffered pocket-piece to their counter,
and still from their own mouths continue to issue counterfeit truths
—in fact, to do nothing but speak pocket-pieces. Yes, sir; I have
known them do this, and never blush or stammer when their eye has
fallen on the copper countenance of the false half-crown, gleaming
reproachfully upon them. But then, to pass bad money is a statutable
offence—whilst to pass lies for truths, if adroitly uttered from
behind the counter, is nothing more than to do a clever stroke of
business. The one practice has led men to the gallows—the other
has taken them to the Bank of England.
“All in the way of trade” is, I know, a phrase that covers great
hypocrisy, great practical deceit, great injustice between man and
man. It is a convenient phrase, that from long custom has become
an allowed apology for the trickeries of dealers. But a highwayman,
who takes a purse, might as well believe that the black crape which
hides his face from the knowledge of the despoiled, does also hide
from his own soul a knowledge of his iniquity. How often is the
“way of trade” no other than so much black crape worn behind the
counter | A man may be as completely robbed by means of a false
protestation, as though the lie were a loaded pistol.
There is, I know, a tenderness in the law towards the trippings of
trade, that seems to show a positive sympathy between law and
roguery. Men, it would almost seem, by general understanding,
allow the necessity of wrong as a proper alloy to keep society toge-
ther. Pure unmixed gold is too good for coin that is to suffer the
wear and tear of passing from hand to hand; and so, that it may
endure the longer, it is mingled with a little wholesome copper. In
the like way, law seems to think pure honesty as altogether too
refined for the hard working-day purposes of trade, and therefore
looks indulgently upon its little shifts—its winning “ways.” Let
me further explain myself.
My opposite neighbour is a chandler and green-grocer: he makes
his gains out of the veriest poor. Rags and keenest hunger are his
miserable customers. You would think, sir, that when a tradesman
held the scales for such buyers, justice would be to him a high reli-
gion. Well, sir, it was only yesterday that this very man was found
to use false weights. . It was his third offence; and he was fined by
the compassionating law—ten pounds !
This same man has at the present moment a boy in gaol, doomed
for six months, for stealing from his shop, when very hungry, one
red herring. Thus, the tradesman may rob by means of scales and
measures, merely paying for a sort of licence to cheat, when detected:
the very gains of his iniquity, too, go to lessen the fine; he can in
fact, with tolerable luck, afford to rob. Now, does not law that
makes such robbery only fineable, look most tenderly upon the evil-
doing : Does it not give a marked preference to the thief behind the
counter above the picker and stealer before it Hence—use light
weights, and pay money for the theft; filch with your five fingers,
and do hard-labour in gaol. Besides, the tradesman is sweetened—
purified by the fine; the stain upon his reputation is blotted up by
bank-paper: now the vulgar thief always bears about him the foul
odour of a prison. The keen nostrils of the police continually smell
in him his first iniquity.
Now, sir, it will be my endeavour, as a tradesman, to acknowledge
no “ways of trade”—to consider truth as truth in the smallest
as in the greatest affairs of life. With this belief, I shall take my
daily stand behind the counter, and cheerfully leave to Providence
the rest. Tell me, dear sir, if I am not right,
And believe me, yours sincerely,
John BALANCE.
LETTER XXXIV.
ANSWER TO THE ABOVE,
MR John BALANCE,
I HAve known you from a boy—yes, from a very babe—and
I did not think you capable of insulting the friend of your excellent
father. Worthy soul it is a good thing that he is out of the world:
he is, it is my belief, saved that worst of all sorrows—a headlong,
disobedient child. Your letter is enough to make him shiver in his
coffin.
I can well understand your insinuation about the false weights.
It is base and cruel. To me, with honourable gray hairs upon my
head To me, almost old enough to be your grandfather It is
true, that, in my time, I was fined, I think three times; but then, I
always proved that the false weights had been substituted by a
malicious servant. The fines were certainly never returned to me;
but there was not one well-disposed person of the Sunday congre-
gation—and twice a-day, MR. John BALANCE, did I appear in my
pew, reserving my evening of rest to look over my books—not one
of them who did not believe in my innocence. But then, I always
studied respectability.
Your notions of business are the notions of a noodle. Truth is
very beautiful no doubt, but if stark-naked truth was always to
stand behind a counter I should like to know who’d go into the
shop. I know the value of truth as well as any man. And
throughout my long and useful life I always used it as the dear late
partner of my joys used her silver teapot—upon holiday occasions.
I had too much respect for the real value of truth to be always
bringing it out upon working-days.
You have no knowledge of the real talent required by a tradesman,
and therefore I should advise you to go to sea, or list for a soldier.
There is nothing so worthy of the attention of man—of his immortal
spirit, as the Reverend MR. Doublech IN used to call it—as business.
It employs all the strength of the soul—for the end and aim of all
business is for man to look upon the rest of the world as only so
many people to make so much money of. He is to consider them—
that is, in a business way—as made especially for his own profit as a
tradesman. And so, if he has only common sense, he is to use it as
he best can for his own advantage. As for what you stupidly call
lies, I always looked upon them as necessary tools for business—
things without which it would be impossible to keep open shop.
Lies are a sort of wooden pegs that keep the world together as if it
was a box; nice little things, so let into the work as never to be
seen. Take out the pegs, and how would the box tumble to pieces !
When you are really come to years of discretion you will know
that the private man and the tradesman are not at all one. Cer-
tainly not. I, Isaac SMIRK, behind the counter, was not the Isaac
SM Ink dressed for church on Sundays. How could I be How was
I to bring up a large family—as yet you don't know the expense of
clothing and schooling six children—in respectability, if I’d played

HURRAH FOR HIGH-HANDED JUSTICE
We are glad to see that the wisdom of our ancestors, as evinced in the
punishment of offenders, which, we feared, had fallen into general con-
tempt, continues, in some favoured nooks of these dominions, to govern
the proceedings of the magistracy.
A glorious case occurred at the BANBURY Petty Sessions. One John
Goggins, labourer, was charged with an offence against the Game Laws.
He had been seen, on the morning of the 1st of September, walking about
in a stubble field with a gun. WILLIAM Cowling, one of the EARL of
Jensey's lookers-out, saw him, the rascal Coggins, to be sure, had no
dog, nor did any game get up, neither did he fire; but witness took his
gun away. A stupid jury might have doubted whether he was sparrow
shooting or not, or have believed his story, that he was going to guard his
potatoe crop. But he had a true English magistrate to deal with, who was
too deep for the rogue.
Mr. MATThews said, it was painful to him to address the prisoner. Of
course. Mr. Matthews, says the Times Reporter, is a clergyman, as
well as a sportsman ; and we may excuse the weakness: particularly as
Mr. Matthews, smothering his sensibilities, inflicted on the offender a
penalty of ten pounds: and said, a distress warrant should be levied for
the amount. , Coggins declared that his goods would not fetch that money.
“Then,” said the just Matthews (how well a malediction in a lay mouth
would have sounded after the “Then l’’) “you stand committed for two
months' hard labour.”
Coggins will probably be ruined, with his wife and family, if he has any.
This is the way to keep fellows in order. This is the method to teach
people what they are at. Would that our 'Squirearchy had still the
making of the laws. Rogues would soon see what was what. Oh, for the
good old days of the stocks, the pillory, and the gallows. Alas ! they
scarcely ever hang any body now !
Princely Thrift.
It appears that Kennington Common, whilom a place for cricket and
other healthful sports, is to be built upon, to benefit the estate of the
Prince of Wales as Duke of Cornwall. These places have been called
the lungs of a town. Surely, to choke the lungs is hardly the best way
to captivate the heart. Will the Prince of Wales be more beloved in
Kenuington if only known as the Prince of Bricks and Mortar 1

A SCENE IN THE COURT OF BANKRUPTCY.
(Before SIR. C. F. WILLIAMs.)
In the bankruptcy of a person named SMITH, a question arose as to
whether a widow should receive out of the estate a debt that was legally
barred by the statute.
Sir C. F. Williams. Certainly it ought to be so, justice is justice;
(to the Solicitor) I say, sir, it ought to be done.
Solicitor. I shall be very happy to bow to the Court, and if you, sir,
will give the order—
Sir C. F. Williams. I shall give no order, sir. I will not be dictated
to by any man breathing. The widow ought to have the money.
Solicitor. So I thought, SIR CHARLEs, and if I have your authority
Sir C. F. Williams. Sir, you have no authority. I am the only person
that has authority here. This Court must not be a bear-garden.
Solicitor. Well, SIR CHARLEs, then I can do nothing.

principle of justice. Who is that old

LIBERATION OF THE GREAT BRITAIN.
Nothing, since the liberation of O'Connell, has excited so great a
sensation as the talked of liberation of the Great Britain, steamer, from
her long and unmerited confinement in the dock of Bristol. , Never was
a prisoner known to be kept in the dock so long, and the penalty has been
inflicted in spite of the fine old national allegory of “Britains never,
never shall be slaves,” for “never never” was there such a slave-as
this unfortunate Great Britain. She was built to be, what is expressively
termed, a “regular out and outer,’ but never having been able to get out,
she has never had a chance of showing whether she could fulfil the
designs of her builders. It is now definitively arranged that the dock
shall be demolished, and as the noble captive passes over the gate that
formerly obstructed her, “See the conquering hero comes P. will be played

JTHE MEEK REMONSTRANCE OF THE MAN
IN BRASS 1
TO MR. ALDERMAN GIBBS.
HE last twenty years, Sir, I
have always been one
of the principal sights
at the Lord Mayor's
Show. When I say
this, I needn't tell you
that I am the man who
rides in brass armour.
I was brought up to
the Bar, but having,
in consequence of a
fatal modesty of tem-
perament, failed as an
Old Bailey pleader, I
was compelled to make
the most of my very
fine figure by riding
the high horse every
ninth of November in
a complete suit of mail.
Denied the Old Bailey
Bar, I nevertheless still
thought I could profit
by brass in some shape.
I confess it ; I have very often thought myself elevated above my
merits. When, riding in state, and looking over the heads of certain
Aldermen, I have thought that nature had created them with a
larger claim to the brass than myself. Nevertheless, I have thought
they had sufficient opportunity of exhibiting their native metal on
the magistrate's bench and at Guildhall meetings. Hereupon I did
not feel wholly abashed at the unworthiness of my elevation.
Alas, Sir, now it is otherwise With you, elected as Lord Mayor,
my position is gone. It is impossible that I can stand against such
rivalry. I shall be no more thought of in the show than so much
gilt gingerbread. Those who deign to look at me will turn away
from my despised glories, as men turn away from bad money. “You
the man in brass 1” they will cry, with contemptuous unbelief–
“Pooh-pooh-a rascally counterfeit.” And then, Sir, they will
turn to a certain carriage, and, with an exulting shout—a shout that,
through my metal, must wither my very marrow—will acknowledge
the presence of the true thing—the Man of the Greatest Brass in
all famed London's city.
I beseech you, Sir, think of my condition. Let me be paid, for I
cannot forego the fee ; but, good Sir, dispense with my services on
the coming ninth of November. Why should I be set upon horse-
back, only to serve as 'a foil to your surpassing merits? Besides,
to put metal upon metal is bad heraldry. Therefore, Sir, let me, on the
important ninth, remain in the bosom of my family. Do not enforce
my presence in the procession only to conquer me. As you are
strong, be merciful; and so you shall ever have the sympathising
admiration of Yours, eclipsed,
THE MAN IN BRAss.
THE GEESE ON THE THAMES.
We regret to say that the Lord Mayor and civic authorities, jealous of
the attraction of MR. BARRY in his washing tub drawn by geese, which
threatened to extinguish the glories of swan-hopping day, have forbidden
all such exhibitions for the future. We believe, however, that that
inventive person, MR. Richard LAMBERT Jones, has suggested to MR.
Gibbs that it would have a famous effect if, instead of using the Lord
Mayor's barge, in the next civic water-party, MR. Gibbs were to allow
himself to be drawn in a tub by four of his supporters chosen from the
Court of Aldermen. SIR PETER LAURIE is all a-gog for the scheme, and
there is a tremendous competition among the members of the court for
the honour of appearing in harness. SIR PETER will, of course, take the
place of one of the leading ganders.
APPROACHING ALLIANCE. -
Shortly will be united in the bonds of political wedlock, Repeal, of
Publin, to Whiggism, closely allied to a wealthy Bedford family.
MA. O'Connell will give away Repeal. After the union, the happy pair
will make the grand tour of Ireland, and towards February repair to their
parents' seats in the House of Commons.
WISDOM OF THE COURT OF ALDERMEN.
BigoTRY is a spicy dish; and we know exactly the sort of faces
that glow above it—the sort of ears pricked up with keen delight at
the savoury morsel. Delicious is turtle; nevertheless, it is occa-
sionally flat, insipid, compared to a highly-seasoned prejudice, cooked
according to that time-honoured recipe—“the wisdom of our ances-
tors.” Within these few days, the Court of Aldermen have been glut-
tonous at such feeding. Yes; they have banqueted upon a Jew,
and filled themselves to their very hearts' enjoyment.
MR. SALoMons, it is well known, has been elected Alderman of
Portsoken. He has, however, been rejected by a majority of the
Court of Aldermen, who would not even give him time—a poor
fortnight—to consult counsel. M.R. SALoMons might have sneaked
into the violet and miniver “as a separatist,” under the Act of 1838.
But MR. SALoMons is, in the noblest sense of the word, agentleman;
and he refused to do so. He might have subscribed the declaration
“upon the true faith of a Christian;” but he rejected the quibble.
For, as Touchstone's knight swore “upon his honour, that the mustard
was naught;" yet, on Touchstone's showing, was not forsworn, seeing
he had no honour to be sworn upon ; so might MR. SALoMons have
subscribed “upon the true faith of a Christian,” being in the strictest
sense of the Jewish nation. But MR. SALoMons, with a true nobility
of nature, spurned the subterfuge.
SIR PETER LAURIE attempted to be very learned in the law. As
we read his speech, we saw in our mind's eye a plethoric flesh-fly
kicking and struggling in a cobweb, and fixing itself the faster with
every wriggle.
However, the Court of Aldermen vindicated the ways of good old
Madam Bigotry, and rejected the philanthropist, the gentleman—
David SALoMons. Poor Bigotry the time was, when the flushed
harridan rejoiced herself at an auto-da-fe—when she delighted herself
with a Jew roasting at the stakeſ “That time, with all its aching joys,
is past;” nevertheless, if she cannot still burn a Jew for his faith, she
may yet insult him for the creed that is within him—and that is
something. Is it not great, wise, benevolent SIR PETER
3 BATHS FOR THE MILLION.
UDGING, from the public meetings, buildings will
soon be wanted for the new public baths. We
propose Covent Garden Theatre : it is useless,
of a capital size, and an overflow in any part
of the house would be quite a novelty there.
The pit would make a capital bath, and the
stage a first-rate springing-board. The chan-
delier could be made into the largest shower-
bath in the world, and the one-shilling gallery
is the very thing for a reservoir. The private
boxes will give ready-made dressing-rooms,
and the scenery-room from its height will at
any time dry a million of towels. Shampooing
might be performed in the treasury. The
scenery from The Daughter of the Danube,
or the Bath-scene from the Revolt of the
Harem, could be carried round the stage,
and flowers from spicy Arabia planted in the
slips. Quadrille parties might be given once
a-week, and Polkas be danced every Saturday, Jullien's orchestra being
rowed about in a large wherry, or tugged by a small steamer. In winter
the pit could easily be frozen over and turned into a Glacially M. This
new 'Bath-Theatre, we are confident, would answer, especially as the
depth under the stage going, as it does, more than half-way towards an
Artesian well, would enable the Proprietors to get their water merely for
the boring.

Mr. R. LAMBERT JONES begs to inform Punch that, according to
his plan, the interior of the Royal Exchange will be decorated with
frescoes designs by HERR SANG, the subjects chosen by Mr. R. LAMBERT

their artistic one, and to make of the Royal Exchange a sort of Walhalla of
City worthies, the figures, which are all allegorical, are portraits. Mr.

CHRISTIAN HUMILITY “BY INCHES.”
IN a brief account of the restoration of St. Olave's Church,
Southwark, we are delighted to meet with the following golden
syllables:— -
* THE PEWS HAVE BEEN CUT Down MANY–INCHES 1 ''
It is a homely saying, that an inch is a good deal in a man's nose.
It is plain that some folks think the same measurement equally im-
portant in a man's pew.
Nevertheless, we hail this small sacrifice to Christian humility as
something. It is too much to expect that well-dressed, well-fed, and
very well-to-do believers can all of a sudden throw down the pews
which have so long enshrined them from the poor and struggling
church-goer—from the man who, with a soul to be saved, does
nevertheless pray for its salvation on a wooden bench. To do this,
would be to confound all those nice distinctions of fortune and ward-
robe never, with propriety, to be forgotten in moments of devoutest
sacrifice.
Besides, consider the danger to worldly respectability from sud-
denly leaving off a pew. What a comfortable, snug thing it is : how
it wraps a man about, keeping him from vulgar breath ! How it
warms his Christianity, making him feel something superior to the
mass of common clay ! And what ? Leave off the pew all at once 1
Why, dear sir, your Christianity may take cold—may fall into a de-
cline—may, alas I die outright. No, sir, no. Do with your pew as
careful people do with their flannel in spring : throw it not off all at
once, but, copying tender St. Olave, leave your pew off by inches.
When we consider the enormous altitude of much church-going
pride, a curious and most difficult sum forces itself upon our mind.
It is this. We give it to be worked by any bishop, cunning in such
arithmetic :—
If a man leave off an inch of his pew a year, in how many years will he
sink to the true standard of Christian humility ?
We have had curious calculations of the time consumed by a cannon-
balſ in its imagined transit from a star to the earth—now, there are
some souls, heavy in their pride as iron shot : how long may it take
to send them from the earth to the stars Alas! who shall say :
Nevertheless, we hail this sacrifice of inches. Our only fear is,
that the coy Christianity of St. Olave having given an inch, the
revolutionists of pews may clamour for an ell.

OPENING OF THE EXCHANGE–THE MAGNAY MANIFESTO.
“Jove in his chair,
Of the sky Lord Mayor.”—Midas.
sceptic who doubts the heart-delighting
axiom—that every man, no matter how
low and poor in worldly estate, has,
nevertheless, a stake in this our merry
England, it is by consequence another
truth, that there is no artificer so
humble, no labourer so mean, no man
whose sole wealth is in his sinews, to
whom England's Exchange has not a
significant value—a most pleasing inte-
rest. True it is, he cannot come “smug
upon the mart ; ” he can make no lucky
bargains there; he cannot every day
shake hands with greeting Fortune, re-
turning home a cosier and a richer
man. No ; the Exchange is for the
merchant prince : it is the palace of
trade reared for its golden potentates
—a Temple of Commerce wherein her
magnificos do profitable sacrifice. Yet
what are princes without subjects :
º
-
ſº

| "Wºº
“Alone, alone;
Prison'd in ermine and a golden chair.”
What your merchant, but the lucky representative of labour—what
all bargains but, in truth, the sweat of thousands turned to the
enriching use of two or three ? Look at that Croesus of the ledger,
whose simple yea passes good for half a million. What, in the very
majesty of money, does he sell but the toil of his vassals; What is
he, if not the chapman and dealer in human energies. Therefore,
most true it is that the meanest labourer has some interest in
England's Exchange. Hence, Monday was a day of rightful rejoicing
to the veriest drudge of trade. And yet—how it happened we know
not—yet might the holiday have been poorly kept by those to whom
holidays are few. Such vulgar folks—whatever might be their
expectations—were significantly rebuked by London's Mayor. Yes;
LoRD MAGNAY, in one of those pithy edicts which high place and
wealth delight to publish, commanded Labour to keep quiet at home,
lest, we presume, his coarse looks should spoil the triumph. Listen
to the big voice of Guildhall :—
“That no person be allowed to pass or remain in the Poultry,
Cornhill, Bartholomew Lane, or Threadneedle Street, after 7 o'clock, except inhabitants
and others going to the houses in those streets, who will be permitted to pass for
;: "...; Antil 9 o'clock, after which time no person whatever will be admitted into
ose streets.”
Happy, privileged people, who had houses or friends “in those
streets.” Otherwise, they were to be shut out from the Eden “after
7 o’clock;” whilst even the few elect householders might not budge
either out or in after nine. Great is the voice of Mayors Yet
have we-O MAGNAY —a shrewd suspicion that you cannot wield
your mace thus despotically. It is our belief, that, for all your civic
regality, Lord DENMAN would, in the Court of Queen's Bench,
construe the law somewhat to your confusion. A man not permitted
to quit or enter his own house after nine o'clock ' What a stab with
the city dagger at Magna Chartal Does not the ghost of KING John,
like UNCLE Toby, draw a long breath, then whistle—Lillibulero !
We doubt not thousands hugged themselves in the fond, the loyal
thought, that Monday would be to them a day of jubilee. True, they
had neither houses nor householder acquaintance in the line of pro-
cession; but then there was their ancient right of way—there was
their allowed property in the broad pavement—they at least pos-
sessed, as it has been truly called, that triumph of democracy. There
they could stand and gaze to their hearts' content, and look at even
the great Lord Mayor, burly with the thoughts of baronetcy—at those
merchant princes on horseback—the solemn aldermen—at the sage
ones of the common council, in their gowns of mazarine. And in
good time, being almost sated with feeding on these civic glories, they
might at length behold the crowning wonder in the royal carriage and
its royal burthen. Then would the poorest Englishman, in a loyal gush
of heart, feel that he had a stake in the country. However imperti-
nent it might be in his poverty to think so, still he would for some
Mansion-house Street,
brief moments revel in the delusion. Yes; the lifeguards were his—
the chamberlain—every officer of state—the cream-coloured horses,
the royal carriage, everything that made up the type of England's
power and greatness, were, for one intoxicating moment, a part of
his own importance as an Englishman; and even, forgetful of the
empty cupboard at home, he would huzza in the very fulness of his
ideal possession.
But no ; such enthusiasm—such fond delusion—was not to be
permitted by the Lord Mayor. MAGNAY “shook his ambrosial curls,
and gave the nod,” and the line of procession was not to be defiled
in the city. The pavement was to be held sacred from poor men's
shoes. And the Lord Mayor doubtless blessed himself for his wisdom.
Why should the pavement be thronged? Were there not seats “to
be let” in shop fronts—even at attic windows t Did not hundreds
of householders offer hospitality—for a consideration? Why, we pay
our hard cash to look even at playhouse royalty, and shall the mob
stare at a real anointed QUEEN gratis Forbid it, loyalty—forbid it,
true respectability
Seats | Why, churchyard clay was let for temporary building.
There, above the consecrated earth, there—where
“The rude shopkeepers of the parish sleep,”—
were built up accommodation for hundreds; and there did dear,
sight-seeing Woman, gaily, lightly clad, sit for patient hours, smiling
though shivering, and all forgetful of the coffins under foot—all nobly
heedless of the colds and damps that might perchance, in come few
weeks, send her to slumber with the dead below.
Now, if really respectable people—that is, if people with money— |
will suffer and tempt all this and more, though “that is not much,” |
will brave the contemptuous pity of the cynic for the love of such a
sight as that of Monday, ought it for a moment to be thought of
that the labouring poor should be permitted to have even the most
fitful glance for nothing? Why, it is a shameful slight—a gross
affront to those who can pay for seats, only to imagine it. No ; to
make the poor uncomfortable, is often only a proper homage to the
snug and well-to-do.
And the Royal Exchange was opened. The QUEEN was feasted
in all queenly glory. The sons of Commerce—that is, the elder
sons—did all that in their pockets lay to honour and be honoured.
Her Majesty looked around her, and saw hundreds of men with the
revenues of princes, and all paid by trade. She saw, as we have
! said, the elder sons of Commerce in the triumph, and flush, and ful-
ness of their wealth. There they were, in that magnificent temple
reared to their greatness. What a glorious gathering ! how full and
complete the satisfaction 1 Nothing—no tittle—was wanting to the
national triumph.
‘Yes—we think—one thing. It may be thought sullen, carping in
us to suggest a fault. We cannot help it. Even though LAURIE
deem us cynical, it shall out. The elder sons of Commerce And
where, we ask, were the younger ones; they, the brethren doomed,
with treble toil, to a starveling patrimony Why was there not a
deputation—a chosen few, just one small table full—from the sons
of labour—yea, and from the daughters too ! Some score or so of the
toilsome hands, without whom England's Royal Exchange would be
of no more account than a Temple of the Winds? Surely it could
not have marred the glory of the picture, but rather —properly
disposed—have blended, an harmonious whole, to have had a few—
just a few—of those whose sweat is, after all, the only gold of your
prince merchant. It would have been pleasing to see this; to mark
the touching acknowledgment of plethoric wealth to toiling poverty.
It was, doubtless, a goodly sight to the QUEEN to behold merchants,
each the owner of a navy. Would her eye have frowned had she
also seen—as a representative of his class—one drudging ship-porter,
only one, with his equals in labour, at the lowest table We think
such a group would have added finish to the picture; but the com-
mittee had, doubtless, better judgment. Yet, would such a homely
party have had a use ; for like skeletons at an Egyptian revel, it might
have mutely preached to merchant princes one common humanity.
However, at the opening of the next New Exchange—yes, in the
year 2844—all this may perhaps be altered.

MODEST PROPOSALS FOR A FASHIONABLE
PROPRIETARY CHAPEL.
HE growing desire of the very
vulgar poor to visit church may
in the minds of some people, it
is much to be feared, go far to
bring the true interests of reli-
gion into contempt, it is here
proposed by certain zealous pro-
jectors to build a chapel for the
exclusive use of the rich and the
very respectable. People in high-
lows and corduroys are never
seen in the pit of the Opera, and
wherefore should they be suffered
to elbow ladies and gentlemen in
their fashionable devotions ! For
such people are there not meet-
ing-houses, nay, even churches:
Keenly alive to the wants of
the superior classes of the neigh-
bourhood of , the present
projectors intend to build a Pro-
prietary Chapel, which shall, in
all its appointments, make reli-
gion, like venison, a luxury for the better orders. Every pew—like
an opera-box—will bear so high a price, that it will be unattainable
save by the wealthy; thus, every religionist will;have the comfort of
confessing himself once a week “a miserable sinner” only in the
very best society. He is hereby spared the humiliation of such an
avowal in the presence of the vulgar, who too frequently presume
upon such merely ceremonious confession. If a gentleman is a
“miserable sinner,” is there any necessity that he should con-
descend to own as much to the very riff-raff: Certainly not.
The elegance and the costliness of the pews—they will be fitted
up under the tasteful direction of MR. BRADw ELL, late of Covent
Garden Theatre—ensuring the most select subscribers, the sermons
to be preached will, it is believed, be of corresponding beauty and
superiority. Thus it may be confidently promised, that the minister
engaged will never talk of “corruption,” and “the grave,” and “the
worm that never dies,” and such distressing subjects—well enough,
and indeed very proper for working people with nerves like whip-
cord—but will so order his discourse that it shall not ruffle a single
feather of the very downiest conscience. Hence the subscribers to
the pews may take a sermon as they take a tepid bath—for a soft
and pleasureable sensation. Not even in the shape of one of his
matches, shall LucIFER be in any way permitted in the proposed
edifice.
A clergyman has been engaged, at an enormous expense, who
brings with him the highest and most delicate testimonials : namely,
a silver warming-pan, the tribute of one admiring fashionable flock,
and two dozen lawn handkerchiefs marked with the hair of the
spinsters of another congregation.
Male and female vocalists, from the theatres, are engaged; and
M. JULLIEN will occasionally preside at the organ.
The beadle already engaged has lived as butler to an earl, and is
therefore used to good society.
The pew-openers have also waited on the upper ranks, having in
their youth employed themselves as family governesses.
No subscriptions returned. Vivat Reginal

ated to the Common Crier in the civic procession was immediately after

THE LAWYER'S CLERK QUESTION SETTLED.
(To The INGENious MR. BABBAGE.)
Hope you will excuse me for troubling you with a
little suggestion. My office is absolutely choked
up with letters from Lawyers'Clerks, complaining
of over-work, under-pay, and ill-usage. I write
almost up to the elbows in a mass of this kind of
correspondence. You will naturally ask, what is
this to you ; Sir, you shall hear, presently.
I pity the case of the poor Clerks; but what
can I do for them? In the first place, I cannot
serve their employers with a writ—the only kind
of argument they could be expected to attend to.
In the next, supposing I could redress the griev-
ances of the servant, my bosom, ligneous as it is,
would bleed for the unhappy master. What
would be the feelings of an Attorney at having
three hours, perhaps, of service wrenched from
him per day, and as much as a crown a week
additional extracted from his pocket? What, in-
deed, could extort so much, but the peine forte et
dure ?
Now, Mr. BABBAGE, I will tell you what I wish
you would do. You have invented a Calculating
Machine. Cannot you likewise invent an En.
ossing Machine—an Automaton Lawyer's Clerk The misery of the
lerk at present in use is, that his frame is composed of flesh and blood;
that there is a heart in his breast, a brain in his skull; there are nerves,
pulses, and other delicate and touchy structures in his anatomy; and
emotions and sensibilities in his moral nature. This constitution of his
ill qualifies him to work on an oak seat, leaning against a hard desk from
morning till near midnight, and to exist on some few shillings a week, with
an old widowed mother, it may be, or perhaps a wife and children, to sup-
port out of that. It creates, also, a demand for an occasional holiday; a
demand which, for six-and-eightpenny considerations, cannot, for the most
part, be acceded to, even in the Long Vacation. But, ingenious Sir,
could you construct an Automaton Clerk, all these inconveniences would
be obviated. Mahogany has no nervous system, springs and wires do
not vibrate with sensations; and to the Attorney's wrong and the
Solicitor's contumely, the whole clockwork would be impassible. The
machine could not contract, matrimony and have to keep a family; and
were you, Sir, its Parent, (which Heaven avert 1) to fall into distress,
it would not be called upon to maintain you. It would bear all kinds of
indignity and ill-treatment without a murmur; it could call no meetings,
write no letters to the newspapers. Like master like slave, it would be
wholly unfeeling. It would work all day, and night too, if necessary,
uncomplainingly, till it got out of order; and then it might be mended.
Here is a Clerk that would work incessantly, and neither eat, sleep,
want payment, or grumble : thus, I apprehend, exactly supplying the
Attorney's grand desideratum—I would advise you to call it THE PATENT
INSENSIBLE LAwyER's CLERK.
I am, ingenious Sir, yours respectfully,
38885?Cº.

THE NOBLE SCIENCE OF WARFARE.
ARCHIMEDEs would have moved the world if he could have got the means of doing it, and
then got the world to stand stock still while he tried the experiment 1 CAPTAIN WARNER
would have spiflicated Europe, if he could only have prevailed on SIR. R. PEEL to supply the
powder and shot for such a magnificent project. Some scientific folks have got into an establishment
at Fulham, from which they issued a prospectus, undertaking to blow up schooners on moderate
terms, and annihilate fortresses at the very shortest notice. All this is to be done by shells;
but the public are called upon to shell-out as a preliminary; and, so far, the plan of the Fulham
folks and that of CAPTAIN WARNER, appear to be pretty nearly identical. The benevolent object of
the parties is, to put an end to war, by making war so truly terrific, that, like the two Kilkenny
cats, it will put an end by its very ferocity to its own existence. It seems to be (familiarly
speaking,) a rum idea to destroy life wholesale, for the purpose of saving it in detail; and we
must say, we prefer the peaceful philosophy of the private in the Royal Artillery, who did for the
touch-hole, what horticulture has already done for vegetation. Instead of spiking the enemies’
guns he watered them—an act for which he deserves to go down to posterity with the watering-pot
in his hand—for there is, surely, more real civilisation in applying the soothing system to the angry
cannon, than in converting it into a monster which even
those whom it serves are afraid of.
We should suggest to the Peace Society, that a corps
should be raised, to be called the Light Water Pots, whose –
duty it should be to -
damp the fury of the
enemies' guns; and
thus introduce a real
Grand Junction be-
tween all the nations
of the world.

THE HARE AND THE PEASANT.
ALTHough many of the pure-minded who offer incense at Exeter
Hall, may not be conscious of the fact, it is nevertheless most true
that John BULL has his idols; to the which with most sanctimonious
face he is ever and anon sacrificing men, women, and babes. John,
with a look of pitying disgust, talks of the superstitions of the past
and of the present: he laments the darkness of the heathen who
have their sacred apes, their consecrated crocodiles. Nay, John
does more than this. John unbuttons his pocket, and pays men to
build ships, that truth and wisdom may be carried to idolaters. He
enlists missionaries—he sends forth the hopeful and strong-hearted
to wither beneath a pestilential climate, so that even withering,
they may be ministrant of civilisation to the savage. And all
the while—simple John—that he is paying for and labonring iu
these good works—he has his own pet idols—his own baboons and
alligators—with his “bold peasantry,” as their constant victims.
Alas! ere John shall again count up these abominations of the
heathen, let him calculate the number of men, with their wives and
families, sacrificed at every quarter-sessions to the idols of the land-
lord—to his hares, his pheasants, and his partridges 1
THE BELLS OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE.
Much disappointment has been expressed at the bells of the Royal
Exchange being fitted up with old tunes, instead of being placed in the
hands of native composers. A rapid stride might have been taken in
favour of English opera, if the British bell-rope had been confided to some
of our English musicians. Though unfortunately they are so much
addicted to pulling different ways, that fearful discord would perhaps
have been the consequence.
PRofessor Taylor has, however, composed a very effective solo for the
largest bell, with a chorus for the little ones. We understand that
Donizetti will be invited to write a romance for the street-door bell, and
a duett for that and the knockers, with full accompaniments for a peal
of six-and-twenty muffin boys, to which the general postman will form a
bass of surprising depth and grandeur. The effect of this composition
will not be tried until the Exchange is in full operation, and the muffin
season has set in, which may be looked for in the course of nature within
a week or two.
THE CITIZENS AND THEIR HORSES.
It would hardly have been supposed, from the awkwardness of
several of the citizens on horseback on Monday, that they and their
horses had ever met before; but the fact is, that the animals had
been introduced formally to their riders on the previous Thursday.
The interesting interview took place at Davis's riding-school in the
Blackfriars Road, the ring of which was devoted to the reception of
the select circle. The noble animals had been brought up expressly
from Woolwich; and were, one by one, introduced by Mr. Davis,
who acted as master of the ceremonies, after the following fashion:
Old JAck, SIR PETER LAURIE–SIR PETER LAURIE, OLD JAck.
Horse tosses his head—LAURIE bows.
Sir Peter. I’m glad to see you, Jack.
Horse. He he l he l
Sir Peter. A facetious animal, upon my honour! I'll try and mount.
Horse. (kicks out behind, and snorts.)
Sir Peter. That's as much as to say neigh (nay), my fine fellow.
Horse. He he he l
Davis (coming up). Well, Sir Peter, what do you think of your new
friend ?
Sir Peter. I never saw so little breeding.
Daris. Oh, nonsense, Sir Peter: you’re strange just now, but you’ll
get on better together after a bit.
Sir Peter. Get on together 1 I can’t get on a bit—he won’t let me.
Such was the “peculiar badinage” that passed on the occasion, and
it was ultimately agreed that, in consequence of the general difficulty
of mounting, the crane which is used for drawing up the hay and
straw into the loft should be at the service of those gentlemen who
might desire at once to be placed in the saddle without any prelimi-
nary rearing of the quadrupeds. The civic cavalry would, of course,
therefore, be drawn up in single line—that is to say, with one rope—
previous to joining the procession.

“Again HE URGEs on his wild can EER."
THE disappearance of GIBBs from the civic procession created some little astonishment, and many were the Inquiries as to what
had become of him. The following Poem gives a bold, but very probable, notion of how the Alderman was really occupied on the
day of the opening of the Royal Exchange. It is supposed that some of his parishioners, meeting with him in a back street, caught
hold of him, and, tied him on to a horse, which got dreadfully into a-rear, and was then suffered to run on without the smallest check-
thus typifying the state of the accounts of St. Stephen's, Walbrook. The Poem begins at the period when the Alderman is about
to undergo his equestrian martyrdom.
“Bring forth the horse t” the horse was brought; Away, away, we madly whisk
In truth he was a noble steed— Along ! past Waithman's Obelisk!
A creature of the hackney sort, On, on we go, we gallop still
Dash'd slightly with the dray-horse breed. Up Ludgate's gently rising hill.
His sire had drawn a fly, A moment now our way seems barr'd,
Into which six would often cram; Oh I shall we stop at last !
His mother was of lineage high, 'Tis the barrier at St. Paul's Church Yard-
Himself was worth—well worth his dam. No, Ino, he gallops past.
He plunged, he kick'd, he rear'd, he snorted, I pull'd the bridle, but in vain,
With ears erect and eye distorted; The horse refused my will to heed;
He switch'd his tail, he show'd his hoof– Each motion of the useless rein
E’en W1DDIcomb had kept aloof But madden'd him to wilder speed.
At sight of such a noble steed, I tried my voice; but nonsense, pooh [.
He was a precious beast indeed. Onwards the brute contemptuous flew :
They seized me fiercely by the daddle; At times I thought he must have stopp'd,
They thrust me down into the saddle ; When 'gainst an omnibus he whopp'd ;
They tied me strongly by the bridle : But vain my hopes 1 the sudden blow
The horrid brute began to shy, Served but to make him faster go.
To kick, to amble, and to sidle, Away, away, we turn and wind,
And then away they let him fly; Leaving the city far behind.
Away, away ! my breath is gone ; He tears away, hock touching hock,
Still gallop, gallop, gallop on. Swift up the Hill of Haverstock:
Down, down the street, and up the Strand, Until, with just exhausted breath,
Over the woman's apple-stand. At last he reaches Hampstead Heath.
We pass the cabs, and here we are, The brute has only strength to bound
Plunged at one bound through Temple Bar. Into the well-remembered Pound ;
The courser's fleetness seems to mock Where in the morning we were found
The slowness of St. Dunstan's Clock. By a policeman going his round.

LETTER XXXV.
FROM A MATRON TO A NEWLY-MARRIEd YoUNG LADY, ON THE
TREATMENT OF A HUSBAND.
MY DEAR CLARIBEL,
YoUR honeymoon being over, I feel it my duty—as, indeed,
it will be my pleasure—to instruct you in the serious purposes of
marriage. I have had my trials, my dear, in what is called the
blessed state, and could if I chose write this letter in the tears of
widowhood. Three times have I been bereft of the tenderest of
husbands—for every one of the dear men was really so—and now
am I left like the lonely dove, to murmur alone. I have, however,
this satisfaction, to know that I managed them all to my heart's con-
tent, whilst they—dear, simple lambs —believed they managed me.
Men in their extreme ignorance call us the weaker sex. The
weaker sex When—and they know it—we can pull and play with
their hearts'-strings as little children play with toy harlequins. How-
ever, never disabuse them of the fond conceit. Our weakness, as
they are pleased to call it, is our best strength. Continue to make
your husband think you the most delicate of creatures, and he will
treasure you accordingly. We all of us seem pretty well to know
and follow out this truth in days of courtship, but forget it almost as
soon as the clerk has said amen. This, my dear girl, is the great
error of our sex : it is this that makes wife the slave and husband
the master. Now it has ever been my plan to perpetuate the privi-
lege that courtship gives us, throughout every day of wedlock.
And very properly. What I is your lap-dog that obediently fetches
and carries—is he suddenly to refuse to obey you, and only because
you have put a collar round his neck, and hold him by the ring of a
chain at your third finger ? Therefore, my dear, let your nerves be
always delicate : hence, your husband will treasure you like a
precious piece of china. Be foolish enough to appear robust, and,
on the contrary, you will have no more care bestowed upon you than
a red clay pipkin.
There are, I know, brutes in the human form, not to be deceived ;
but your husband is, I trust, not of them. As a girl, I remember
a monster of the sort. My own dear mother—from whom, let me
confess it, I learned many precious lessons—she made as much as
any woman of her nerves. Well, one day, my father poking the
fire, down came—as you know, sometimes they will come, with such
a clatter—the shovel and tongs. My mother screamed, declared my
father wanted to get rid of her, and immediately retired to her
chamber. Though a party was to dine with us, my mother—true to
her principles—resolutely went to bed. My father was all self-
reproach and sorrow. He related the unfortunate event to the
monster I speak of, saying something about “the wear and tear of
the female constitution.” Whereupon, I shall never forget it, the
wretch replied—“Pooh-pooh Female constitution I It never
wears—it never tears : at the worst it only stretches.” And this—
their conduct proves it—is the brutal faith of thousands. My dear
father, however, was of the contrary belief; so well too did my dear
mother manage, that after this fall of the shovel and tongs, he never
after poked the fire as if the poker was really his own. And this is
as it should be.
Hence, my dear girl, cultivate your nerves: you can't pet 'em too
much. Something will always be happening in the house,_and
unless your husband be worse than a stone,—every new fright will
be as good as a new gown or a new trinket to you. There are some
domestic wounds only to be healed by the jeweller.
I don't advise you not to love your husband very much,--but
never show the abundance of it. How men impose upon what I call
a superfluity of affection, it is dreadful to think of . No ; there is a
decent sort of tenderness—a sort of tepid love—that is the safest.
It never permits a wife to commit herself; it never shows to the
man that he is supreme in her affections, and so enables him to sport
with them. However, do not let him think himself indifferent to
you : certainly not; at least, let the poor man have the benefit of
the doubt.”
In the slightest case of sisterly frailty, be all indignation. It is the
very easiest and cheapest way of airing your own excessive goodness.
Now and then, too, you can—with great pain to yourself, of course—
hazard suspicions of some of your acquaintance. Suspicion, skilfully
used, is an excellent thing. Like a little dust of rouge, if very ten-
derly laid on, it throws out in fine relief the natural beauty of the
wearer. Rouge is a darling little fib, that lies, as somebody says, like
truth—and so, I take it, is if properly applied, a slight suspicion.
They may both colour false modesty.
There is, too, a sort of side-wind way that will enable you at once
to please and tease your husband. Jealousy—that is, a happy affec-
tation of the passion—is a wonderful weapon in a skilful hand.
Therefore, when walking with the poor man, declare that he looks
at every woman he meets, and sulk accordingly. Sometimes, how-
ever, vary the accusation, and declare that every woman he meets
looks at him. From this assumed fact, you can make any deductions,
and endeavour in a torrent of words to declare how very, very
miserable you ought to be. The man, of course, must think himself
dear to you, or wherefore such fantastic jealousy " . He must feel,
though with a feeling of wretchedness, that you love him; or where-
fore show the love with so much misery to him Does not puss love
the live yet wounded mouse she bites and scratchest
Again, as to temper, never let it be certain. Husbands—I know
them—presume upon evenness of temper. No, let your husband feel
that he is never safe. He will accordingly be gentle, watchful, in
his manner. Hence, be at times in the most exuberant spirits; and
then, with a thought—at some unconscious look of your husband,
some playful word—have a mute tongue, and brows of threatening
thunder. In your very gayest moments, let your helpmate feel as if
he is called upon to admire some curious gun—very beautiful, but to
be most carefully handled, lest it go off, and destroy him.
If your husband wishes for music, declare you have a sudden
headache, and add this, he ought to have seen as much, and not have
asked you. If, on the contrary, he has a book, or would doze by the
fire, immediately play the “Battle of Prague,” with all the cannon
accompaniments.
If he wish you to go out with him, say he always asks you when he
knows you can't go; and then, on the contrary, desire that he shall
take you to the opera or play, when you are well aware that he has
some previous engagement.
On this point, too, be particularly obdurate. When your husband
goes out with a likelihood of returning home late, insist upon sitting
up for him. He may urge, that he can take the key; that, in fact, it.
will annoy him to keep anybody from their bed. Meet all this with
a cold, decisive assurance, that you will sit up for him. If he come
home late, what a delicious triumph for you ! There you are,
my love—I always was—in your nightcap and wrapt in three shawls,
making up yourself for the picture of a very much wronged woman.
The culprit at length returns; you catch his eye, and lead it to
dwell upon the reproachful candle guttering in the socket—that
candle, which in very weariness of heart and for nothing else, you
have every five minutes mangled with the snuffers, as though uncon-
sciously to make the case all the stronger against your offending
mate. Sometimes on such occasions, say nothing, but cold as a
statue walk up-stairs. Sometimes, too, it will add considerably to the
pain of the criminal, if you carefully draw a sigh, and “wish you
were in your grave.”
As for your husband's friends, give them always a chilling welcome.
If now and then they insist upon staying, as you think, late, declare
that they have had wine enough, and they ought to know it.
My dear mother had an admirable way. Two or three times—for

my father never tempted her oftener—she sat up guarding the fire-
place. No coal did she suffer to approach it. The fire went out ; it
was piercing winter; and then in a triumph, only known to such a
wife, did she retire to her room, comforting herself that “They’d
soon be starved out, and must go.”
I have herein, my love, thrown down only a few hints; but I can
add a great many more to them, if I find you worthy of my teaching.

LETTER XXXVI.
THE YOUNG LADY'S ANSWER.
MADAM,
At present, I have no wish that my husband should leave
me; when I have, I shall lose no time in availing myself of your
instructions, feeling quite convinced that they could not but very
soon lead to such a conclusion.
I remain, yours &c.,
CLARIBEl SMITH,
MAGNAY THE MAGNATE.
WE understand the following were the original regulations, of
which MAGNAY the Magnate had prepared a draft, in a fit of after-
dinner dignity. The fact of his dining, as usual, alone, accounts for
the regulations being such as, if he had had a friend at his elbow,
he never would have been permitted to promulgate.
Regulations.
&lt, MAGNay, Monarch of the Mansion House, King of all the
Cockneys, and Defender of Temple Bar, hereby declare our
royal will, that nobody shall, on any pretext whatever, go in or
out, backwards or forwards, or to, by, or from his own abode,
between the hours of nine and six, on the 28th of October; and
we further order, that persons in need of medical assistance
shall postpone their necessity until after the latter hour, or take
the consequences as part of the honour conferred on them by
the visit of her Majesty: ſor inſerras, the old Greeks (here his
Lordship called for another bottle of his own private champagne), for
whereas, the old Greeks did make sacrifices, called holocausts,
on the triumphal entry of their Roman Emperors (“There's a
bit of classical for 'em,” writes his Lordship, in a note): amb
toūtreas (more champagne), it is much better that twenty citizens
should die than one sovereign should be impeded—for it is the
law of the land that sovereigns do always pass—(“There's a joke
for 'em ; surely that'll do”); and our blessed sovereign shall pass,
or my name ain't
Jllaguay.
These regulations were, of course, carefully, edited by the City
Remembrancer, whose duty, we suppose, is to remember when the
Lord Mayor forgets himself. The spirit of the regulations, it will
| however be seen, was preserved faithfully.
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH.-OF TITLE BY OCCUPANCY.
INCE we began writing the present elaborate work,
we have made it a rule never to sit down to a
fresh chapter without reading through the whole of
the Statutes at Large, to see what the law originally
was ; and we then turn to the recent acts to see
what the law is on the subject we are about to
treat of.
Title by occupancy appears to have been a
sort of title that a man acquires to a place in the
pit of a theatre, which he takes by the mere act of
jumping into it. We had arrived at this con-
clusion when we lighted on the 29th Car. II., c. 3.;
and we gradually kept reading up to the 14th
of Geo. II., when, having got as far as chapter
20, we discovered that the title of common occu-
pancy is utterly extinct and abolished. We there-
fore considered it useless to put the match to that
mine of learning with which we were ready to explode, and batter away
the barriers to legal knowledge, for, as title by occupancy was semi-
tmashed by the 29th Car. II, and received the finishing blow from the
14th of Geo. II., it is not quite consistent with the plan of this work
to say anything more upon the subject.
In accordance, however, with the quaint practice of the old law-writers,
we feel justified in beginning to talk about something else when we find
there is nothing to be said about the matter which nominally forms the
subject of our chapter. We, therefore, rush precipitately from title by
occupancy to the consideration of islands rising in the middle of seas and
rivers. These belong to the king, if they start up suddenly, like ghosts
through stage traps; but if they collect together by slow and impercep-
tible degrees, like the building of the NELson column, they go to the
owner of the land adjoining. Land left dry in the middle of the sea
sometimes belongs to the first occupant—the Goodwin Sands to wit—but
when the tide comes up, the occupant is glad to release his claim by
means of a regular conveyance.
It is a maxim, that whatever hath no owner is vested by law in the
sovereign; but this is hardly correct, for an infant left deserted, without
an owner, on the step of a door, with a flannel waistcoat on, is vested in
the flannel, without being vested in the sovereign.
THE A. A.D.ERMAN".
(by A PARIshioner of st. Stephen's, walbaook.)
How gallantly, how merrily, they ride upon their way;
Fleet-street is in commotion, the QUEEN comes here to-day !
The Aldermen are mounted, and sitting bolt-upright,
Like riders in whose eyes it is no joke to hold on tight.
All London owns their triumph, they ride along two-deep,
Small boys come up to look at them, their seats so well they keep.
In their wake, as mild as new milk, stand policemen stiff and stark;
Oh I who would not be Aldermen, in such a famous lark 1
Oh! proud must be our Alderman (tho' he looks queer to-day),
Of all the glories he shall win upon next Lord Mayor's day;
He's fought the fight and conquered (how, is neither here northere),
Nobility, which he shall have, when he's installed Lord Mayor.
I would I were an Alderman, churchwarden in our ward,
To hold the books for eighteen years, and no accounts afford.
I'd say to Punch or CRoly, who dare to make so free,
Some day I'll be Lord Mayor, and then you'll see what you will see :
Our Alderman look'd half-ashamed, and more ashamed he grew,
Still spoke he to SIR CLAudius, and smiled on all he knew:
He look’d up to the windows, and he look'd down by his knee,
And there, in every hand, his eye that horrid Punch did see I
Last night an awful rumour came over Walbrook way,
And we heard our fine old Alderman the balance meant to pay;
The Vestry hoped it might be so, but nought else could we hear
To give us hope we should be out of Chancery this year.
All night we talked it over, we couldn't go to sleep,
And this morning, all through Walbrook, on Gibbs our eye we keep.
He rides among the Aldermen, his gay gown streaming free,
But we fear we may whistle ere the balance we shall see.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BEADLES OF ENGLAND.
Oua articles on the British Beadlery have had a very remarkable effect
on that extraordinary body—a body, by-the-by, which we are justified in
looking at as an offshoot from the early Beefeatery of our Saxon ancestors.
While, however, we are gratified to see the effect of our criticisms on the
Beadlery in general, we are sorry to perceive that Lowther Arcade has
rushed, from the very midst of meanness, into the extremes of extrava-
gance. Lowther Arcade has torn the cheap Berlin from the hand, and
the used-up gossamer from the head, of her Beadle, to replace the one with
kid, and the other with a chapeau emblazoned with a profusion of gold-
lace of the costliest character. This was not our object. We never con-
templated urging the Lowther Arcade into the absurdity of bedizening her
Beadle; our objection simply was, to a beadle of “shreds and patches:”
for such a beadle ought not, we thought, to wield the cane and the destinies
—at once—of an extensive thoroughfare.
Our purpose always has been to give to every street and arcade a cheap
Beadle—but, at the same time, a decent Beadle. Lowther Arcade has
wrapped him up in gaudy trappings, and the result is that the figged-out
functionary is fast falling into the arms of a sort of luxurious indolence,
which is too often the consequence of ill-judged finery. We trust that the
Arcade will come to its senses, and at once proceed to strip her Beadle of
that superfluous lace which can only enervate the mind—and thus *mpair
the efficiency of him who wears it.
THE KING OF SAXONY AND THE JEW JEWELLER
**The king or Saxony, before his journey to England, made purchases of a Jewish
jeweller to the amount of 30,000 dollars for presents. On distributing them it appeared
that most of the stones were false, for which reason the return of all the presents is
requested.”-Dutch paper.

Sir ;
This is how they make the
laws, Sir,

For the opal palms the flint off.

Kings are chisell’d, by these presents,
Just as states will diddle peasants.
MAZEPPA GIBBS.
Ir will be seen that it was adjudged prudent for ALDERMAN Gibbs not
to take part in the civic procession. Ride si sapis was the maxim of the
laughing philosopher; but don't Rupe si sapis was evidently whispered
by somebody into the ear of the churchwarden of St. Stephen's Wal-
brook. It is probable that the Lord Mayor elect is keeping himself back
for the ninth of November. It would certainly have been a pity to have
weakened the effect his appearance is likely to produce on the latter
occasion.
To gib is to back out, and Gipps has shown his wisdom in gibbing or
backing out of a ceremony where he might have divided the attention of
the public with the Sovereign, in a manner that he would, perhaps, have
found rather disagreeable.
Queen Elizabeth and the citizens.
It is reported that when Queen Elizabeth visited the city, she dis-
missed her military attendants, and the Spanish Ambassador having
inquired, rather impertinently, “Where are your Majesty's guards?” she
replied, pointing to the citizens, “These are my guards." We have searched
into the truth of this anecdote, and find that Queen Elizabeth was asked
the question, but the reply was not exactly as it is stated above. Her
Majesty pointed to the mob, and said in the quaint phraseology of the
period, “Guards, mylord ambassador? marry what need I of guards, when
my Lord Mayor sends me so many of these honest black-guards to wait
upon me!”
-

- - NEW BOOKS. -
- We have to announce the publication of Tecumseh, a Tragedy, &c., from
the goose-quill of “George Jones, Esq., M.R.S.” Our limits do not
permit us, in one Number, to canvass the pretensions of MR. Jones; we
his merits. By such means we shall be enabled to display his mar,
his taste, his style, his ignorance, his effrontery, his most amusing conceit.
We shali commence this herculean labour next week. Joses, by the way,
in his Preface, has a fling at us and others as “atheistical writers.”
Atheistical : That is, we do not believe in Jones.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE OPENING OF THE ROYAL EXCHANGE.
Monday, the 28th of October, dawned somewhat hazily, and a fog,
which came up to town with one of the early busses, threatened to obscure
one of the brightest days in the civic annals. On entering the metropolis
the stranger was met by barriers at every turn, for the authorities even in
the most distant parts of London tried to get up a notion that they had
something to do with the ceremony; and the parish of St. Martin's-in-the-
Fields particularly distinguished itself by barricading all its principal
thoroughfares, so that vehicles kept rushing about from street to street,
up and down, backwards and forwards, in consequence of the arrange-
ments that had been made for facilitating their progress. On reaching the
Strand, mounds of gravel thrown into the middle of the road announced the
fact that something national was about to happen. . The various shops in
the line of procession were fitted up in a style that showed a severe struggle
between loyalty and lucre, for the devices partook equally of puffs for the
goods and affection for the sovereign. . At an early hour, people who had
been persuaded that they must be in time to secure good seats, for which
they had paid ten shillings in advance, took up their stations in the shop
windows as decoy ducks to those who got the same accommodation for
about half-a-crown, by dropping in just in time to view the procession.
St. Clement's Churchyard presented a small array of shivering victims at
eight o'clock, who had paid half-a-guinea each; but at about eleven, the
gailery was tolerably well filled at a shilling a head from the casual comers.
It was a glorious sight to see the goods removed from the windows of
the shops on the line, and female loveliness occupying the places of
shawls and sugar. Unfortunately, in some places the tickets were left in
the upper panes, while the company filled the lower; and thus we saw
“Alarming Failure” suspended immediately over the head of a gentle-
man who had been expressly got up in a white waistcoat, and curled hair
to do honour to the occasion. A splendid galaxy of British beauty was
labelled “Tremendous Sacrifice, all at Four-and-nine ;” while a group of
juveniles grinned gracefully under a ticket announcing “Families Sup;
plied" to the astonished multitude. The newspaper offices accommodated
their advertisers, and we recognised A. Rowland AND SoN lolling in the
first-floor window of a Sunday print; while the individuals who are continu-
ally apostrophising “Those about to Marry,” were peering over the parapet.
The decorations of the houses were of arious merit, and among others
we particularly noticed Isherwood's, 9 Ludgate Hill, where a piece of
calico was suspended from a walking-stick, out of the window on the fifth
story. ... The calico was richly fringed with age, for it was literally
unravelled—and such a mystery as such a flag, really stood in need of
unravelling. We must acquit Isherwood, who is a Decorator, of any wish
to puff himself, for that bit of dirty calico was never exhibited as a
specimen of his decorative powers.
The next extraordinary instance of illustrative failure was at DAkIN
AND CoMPANY's, the tea-dealers, in St. Paul's Church-yard. These gentle-
men exhibited a tableau of four men, emptying horns of plenty into
nothing, surmounted by a portrait of the QUEEN, with two black eyes, and
having underneath some allusion to the sun never setting on her pos-
sessions. Who was the artist of DAKIN AND CoxipANY we should be glad
to know, that we might avoid him.
Immediately opposite the transparency was an immense window
crammed full with British Manhood and Female Beauty, with the words
“Warranted not to shrink,” inscribed on a large ticket exactly over
them — the label usually applied to broadcloth ; but it was not inap-
propriate to those spectators who might have shrunk affrighted from such
a picture as the transparency of DAKIN AND CoMPANY exhibited. An
unscrupulous gallopping of horse guards on to the toes of the multitude
announced the approach of the procession, and the wanton plunging of the
policemen's staves into the breasts of the crowd, bespoke the propinquity
of the spectacle. The cortège began with two evident glass-coaches, and a
hired cab with a livery groom put in it, to make believe it was a private
one. Then came the royal carriages with all sorts of equerries and sticks
and grooms in them, and then followed a few trumpeters with palpable
Taglionis, ill-concealed under gowns of scarlet; then came the Common-
councilmen, trembling on their horses, with the artilleryman, who was in
the habit of riding the noble beast, at the side of each. Then came the
Remembrancer in an awful state of trepidation, nearly overbalanced by a
terrific weapon, which he poised on the whole with some dexterity. The
Aldermen next appeared amid shouts of laughter, and one of them was
evidently negotiating with the artilleryman whether he should dismount
from his horse, in consequence of the animal being disposed to an
amiable amble. A correspondent, by the bye, subsequently informed us
that there was ultimately a dissolution of partnership between the gallant
Alderman in question and the horse alluded to, which indeed was

LETTER XXXVII.
FROM A YOUNG GENTLEMAN, SOLICITING HIS FATIIER
To PAY HIS DEBTS.
-- sº-
º Kºfi & º
Fºº ſº
My Dr. An FAT: Ea,
How often have you told me that I should see my folly!
Indeed, sir, you are a true prophet ! I never thought it possible that
I could look upon the world as now, in very truth, I find it—a
deceitful, hollow, seductive place, in which there is nothing worthy
of the mind of man, save those inestimable comforts which, had I
but followed your wise and excellent counsel, I should by this time
have been in the enjoyment of. Ah, sir! there are many young men
who, in their worst inisfortunes—and can there be worse than debt?—
are nevertheless spared the remorse which at this moment preys
upon your wretched son. They—poor fellows 1—may have been
launched upon the sea of life—as you have often pertinently called
this vale of tears—without rudder or compass; with nothing, sir, to
direct or counsel them. It is no wonder when such men suffer ship-
wreck, ºr are stripped by pirates. . But, sir, I vainly seek a single
comforting excuse. I have had the best of men and kindest of
fathers, who has bestowed upon me advice of greater value than
Pearls-more precious than gold. And yet how headstrong, wild, and
Yicious—yes, sir, I blush to write it—vicious I have been, reckless of
thoseinestimable precepts which of themselves ought to have enriched
Ine with a treasure more lasting than wealth. But, sir, at length I
am convinced. , Yes, sir, my eyes are opened, and I now behold the
precipice on which I stand. Another step or two and I had been
lost for ever. But there is yet time to draw back—yes, sir, aided by
Yºur parental hand—there is, I fondly hope, yet time for me to regain
all that I have lost; except, indeed, the precious hours that, as you
once beautifully expressed it, I have cast away like water in the sea.
I write, sir, as you will perceive, from a prison. IIa my ho-
noured father, it is—I humbly believe—impossible even for you to
imagine the change that prison walls have worked in me. They have
softened my heart—they have made me take an inside look into
myself—they have shown me, written with a terrible hand, the long,
long list of all my vices, all my follies; they have—but I cannot
pursue the theme. The very recollection of the pain. I have caused
you almost makes me drop the pen abashed; nevertheless, I will
struggle with my feelings, and, if only for penance, try to proceed.
With all my sufferings, I nevertheless try to feel grateful to my
creditors who have placed me here. There are, I am sorry to write
it, yºung men in this prison upon whom the moral of the place (as I
calli) seems entirely lost. They give themselves up to the most
reckless enjoyments; they drink-for, somehow, drink is smuggled—
they game, they play at rackets;–in fact, they sink from bad to
worse, and when they return to the world, they will, I fear, visit it
more like pests, than as reformed, rational creatures. , Again and
again have I been tempted by some of these brawlers to join in what
they madly call their pleasures. But no, sir; I trust I am not wholly
lost. IIitherto, I have lived as much as possible apart from all-I
have read, sir, read the one Book, which it was your best advice to
me always to read. There are lost young men in this place, who say
a father—“ governor” is their slang expression—is a person made by
Providence only to pay his son's bills; I hope, sir, that I have a
truer, a nobler notion of the uses of a parent. I fervently trust that
in entreating of you for this, the third and last time, to pay my debts,
you will believe me when I assure you that I do this with the greatest
reverence for your parental character—with (whether you grant or
refuse my prayer) abounding gratitude for all that you have accoin-
plished for a hitherto unworthy son.
I assure you, dear sir, this time my penitence is profound. From
my present feelings, I know I can withstand all future temptations.
“Ha, ha!” cried one of the spendthrifts here, “you’ll soon get
tired of this moping, miserable life; you’ll soon be a jolly, roaring,
drinking dog like one of us.” But no, sir! although this prison
should be my grave, it shall at least be the tomb of a penitent.
With many burning blushes I enclose you a list of all my debts—
really all; pay them, my dearest father, and be assured of the
gratitude and obedience of
Your erring, but affectionate Son,
CHARLEs BUTTER.
P.S.—I have been urged to liberate myself as a bankrupt ; but I
trust, sir, I can still feel like your son—can still respect the honour of
the family. I'll die first.
LETTER XXXVIII.
THE FATHER'S ANSWER.
Sin,
You have seen your folly! so often that, it is evident, by
this time you are quite accustomed to it. All your long letter may
be boiled down, like spinach, into three words, “Pay my debts.”
All the rest is mere flourish—mere palaver. No, sir; you may break
my heart, but you shall not break my fortune. I 'll not pay a single
sixpence.
I am, your affectionate Father,
John RuTTER.
P.S.—You may become a bankrupt as soon as you like. Thank
heaven the honour of the family is too secure to be injured by such
an unprincipled spendthrift. Not a sixpence, sir-not a single
sixpence.
LETTER XXXIX.
FROM THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN'S MOTHER.
My BelovED Boy,
I Haven't slept a wink since you’ve been in that horrid
place. I had n't yet dared to speak to your father; but I saved your
ietter, which, in a dreadful rage, he threw upon the fire. Ha! my
dear boy, that letter made me almost happy. With the abilities you
have to write such a letter, what might you not do in this world ! If
you would only be your own friend, what could stand in your
way ?
But I please myself in the belief that your repentance is sincere.
I am heartily glad that you have nothing to do with the riotous and
sinful set about you : most glad to find that you neither drink, nor
game, nor do anything but read that one Book. Continue to do so,
my dear boy, and depend upon it your father shan't have a minute's
rest in his own house until you are again among us. God bless
you !
Your affectionate Mother,
MAnt H.A. But TER.
P.S.–I send you 10l. I hope this time that your list of debts is
quite correct: that you have put all down : for you know how you
deceived your poor father twice before.

LORD MAYOR'S DAY.—GIBBS, MAYOR
“Hung be the heavens with black 1"—Shakspere.
AT an early hour this morning, (Nov. 9th, 1844,) the solemn tolling
of the great bell of St. Paul's struck upon the heart of the City of
London. After a short interval, the bell of every other city church
also pealed forth; whilst the bell of St. Stephen's—“swinging slow,
with sullen roar”—had a peculiarly heavy note of lamentation.
It seemed as if some great—some monstrous evil—had fallen upon a
doomed people ! Misery—a sense of degradation—appeared in the
lengthened faces of all men Milkwomen served their ha'porths
with a sigh—housemaids, for once speechless, took in the fluid, and,
with apron corner, wiped away a tear. Even old-clothesmen crept
stealthily along, as though “shod with felt,” and the very dogs, that
had any voice to bark, barked hysterically The birds in cages, at
the windows, sat in lumps upon their perches, motionless and dumb.
On every coach stand, coach and cab-men were seen, looking down
with leaden eyes upon their horses' backs, and listlessly playing with
their whip-thongs. Even the horses drooped, with the unchewed
hay depending from their mouths. All–all was desolation 1
Men would meet one another, pause a moment, and then despe-
rately smiting their foreheads with their fists, start madly on ; others
would heave a deep groan, and creep away, as though they crawled to
the grave. Whilst ever and anon, some miserable wretch, whose
grief was too mighty for his heart, would wring his hands, and
scream in terrible alto-" Gibbs is Mayor Gibbs is Mayor 1”
“Woe—woe to London 1” yelled another. “A doomed generation 1”
groaned a third And still the bells tolled, tolled, tolled !
Ere the silent citizens had swallowed their fourth roll, and eaten
their tenth egg, most of the houses in the line of procession from
the Guildhall displayed emblems of woe. Almost from every
window hung yards of sable cloth; whilst not a few civic patriots
had caused all their shutters to be painted three coats black.
MR. LAMBERT Jon Es had, at his own cost, arrayed the Wellington
statue in a very respectable—if, indeed, respectability is a word for
such a frantic moment—in a very respectable mourning cloak;
and it was observed by those who had strength to look up, that under
the circumstances his Grace looked as well as could be expected.
Some sympathising, unseen hand had also given to the statue of
QUEEN ANNE, St. Paul's Churchyard, a petticoat of blackest bom-
bazine. But neither time nor space will allow us to particularise the
many types of woe.
Silence reigned in Guildhall. The sheriffs who were in attendance,
evidently thought themselves in Newgate, and behaved accordingly.
The members of the Court of Aldermen seemed ashamed of them-
selves and said nothing. Two or three were observed to desperately
bite their nails. SIR PETER LAURIE alone began a smile, but even
he could not go through with it !
At half past eleven, the Lord Mayor was informed that the
Sheriffs were waiting for him, when he descended to the Council-
Chamber. The unfortunate man walked with tolerable firmness;
shook hands with the Sheriffs; said he felt happy, and having begun
to suck an orange, intimated that he was quite prepared :

The procession took the ordinary route, proceeding to Southwark
Bridge. Thence the Lord Mayor embarked in the state barge
(painted black, and bearing pewter escutcheons). The barge was
rowed—the men keeping minute strokes—to Westminster. All the
craft in the river had their colours half-mast high. Minute guns
were fired. As the barges passed under the various bridges, sprigs
of rosemary, yew, and other funereal plants, were showered down
upon them.
The Lord Mayor having landed at Westminster, and performed
certain ceremonies—(he sucked another orange,)—returned to Guild-
hall. No sound was heard from the populace save a few sobs—some
mutterings of grief—some indistinct words of sorrow and despair.
T H E E A N Q. U E T.
. In the evening, the Lord Mayor gave the accustomed inaugural
dinner at Guildhall. Everything was cold—very cold. Even the
smiles on the faces of the visitors seemed iced.
* The Ministers of State, the judges, and foreign ambassadors—as a
matter of duty—were present. We are not enabled, from want of
space, to give the general bill of fare. The model of an accompt-
book, in very rich pound cake, attracted melancholy attention. It
was, however, not touched—a label being affixed to it, written “Not
to be opened. Gibbs, Mayor.”
The usual loyal toasts were given, and drunk with due respect.
After these, followed “the health of SIR Rob ERT PEEL.”
SIR Robent rose, and in that happy vein of pleasantry which will
immortalise him among England's prime ministers, addressed the
company. He said, “It gave him great pleasure at all times to dine
in the city. In the first place he was always sure of a good dinner ;
ship was not a patent place—to set up a shop anywhere within their
ancient liberties. To come, however, to the point. Shaks PERE,
that Stratford Wizard of the human heart—and the citizens delighted
in SHAKs PERE, for had they not given money for his autograph,
albeit they still refused him a theatre for his plays —SHAkspenE,
with his prophetic genius, had foretold the present mayoralty. Yes :
he (SIR Robert) would prove it. When Polonius asks Hamlet, “Do
you know me, my lord ' Hamlet replies, “Very well; you are a
fishmonger.”—“Not I, my lord, says Polonius. “Then,' answers
Hamlet, ‘I would you were as honest a man.” From this, it was
clear that SHAkspenE looked upon fishmongers as men of the
greatest probity on earth. Now, Michael Gibbs, Mayor, was of
the worshipful company of Fishmongers; and had in a hundred
ways, familiar now to all the world, illustrated the subtle truth of
SHAkspear. He had shown, that of all men he was the fittest for
the seat he then occupied ; fittest by his urbanity, his gentleness, his
almost morbid anxiety to show a crystal reputation to the world.
In every trust, and he (SIR Robert) would not dwell upon their
number, for which his Lordship was answerable to his fellow-citizens,
his account-books had been as open as his temper—quite as open.
In his Lordship's nature, all was plain ; in that there was no double-
entry. Plutanch told a story of Alcibiades, who once accosting
PER1clEs, asked what he was pondering on. PER1cLEs answered,
“I am thinking how to return my accounts.”— Should you not,’
rejoined the unprincipled AlcIBIADEs, “should you not rather think
how to make no return at all 2’ PLUTARch had not chronicled the
reply of PER1cles, but he (SIR. R.) could well imagine what would
have been the indignant answer of Lord Mayor Gibbs, if, in the
situation of the great Athenian, he had been counselled to such a
paltry, such a double-faced evasion. It was, therefore, with the
highest admiration of the manly, straightforward, unequivocating
character of his Lordship, that he gave health and prosperity to his
Mayoralty.”
It was plain that the company shared in the sentiments of SIR
Rob ERT PEEL, for whilst the toast was drunk—so intense was the
admiration of all—that, we are assured upon the authority of Toast
Master ToolE, he heard a pin drop
The Lord Mayor returned thanks in an affecting speech. He said,
among other things, that being entrusted, as Lord Mayor, with the
civic Scales of Justice, he felt he should be quite happy so long as the
Balance remained in his hands.
Other toasts followed ; after which a Ball was held, and dancing
was kept up until a late hour at night. It was past nine before all

206 PUNCH,
— — -—
OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE BRITISH AND FOREIGN INSTITUTE.
“Hark, hark! the dogs do bark,
The beggars are coming to Town.”
Old Song.
- UckinghAM (the redoubt-
VA- 23-sºº. able %. Silk)
º --- N has arrived in Lon-
- - don, after having
indulged in a series
of lectures on the
advantages, &c. &c.,
of the British and
Foreign Institute.
lie has now issued
a manifesto, in
which he states
that “the Club
łooms have been
recently re-opened
under the manage-
ment of MR. NEAL,
an extensive wine-
merchant of long
standing at Tun-
bridge Wells,” but
how long he will be
able to stand the
British and Foreign
Institute, can at
present be only a
matter of specula-
tion. We are told
that “in fixing the
tariff his great aim
has been to unite
economy with suffi-
ciency of quantity;”
which reminds us
of the enormous plain pies stuck in a window in St. Giles's, with the
words “Larger than ever ! only twoPENCE ' ' " suspended on a label
over them. The immense importance of this arrangement to the mem-
bers of the British and Foreign Institute cannot be denied, but “two
things” we are told “are required to obtain for it that degree of success
by which alone it can be upheld.” One is “more members ;” the other
is, that “all the members, the old as well as the new, should give it
at least their occasional visits and assistance,” or in other words the
members must patronise the cuisine as well as the conversazione. . We
should recommend the introduction of the fourpenny arrangement of the
sandwich and glass of ale; and a baked potato-stand on the drawing-
room landing-place would afford a luxurious luncheon to the economical
savant; or a glass of hot elder, including rusk, for 2d. would perhaps
furnish a light and wholesome petit souper to the junior branches, who
are taken in as well as their parents at the British and Foreign Institute.
There is some vagueness about the announcement that “the drawing-
rooms are open from 9 A.M. to 11 P.M. to all the members, and especially
to ladies.” We are told the literary department has been improved ; but
if this is the sort of grammar we get after the improvement, what must
have been LINDLEY MURRAY's treatment previous to the amelioration
The drawing-rooms “ open to all,” and “especially to ladies,” reminds
us of “Caesar and Pompey very much alike, especially Pompey.” Are
the gentlemen obliged to squeeze in through a small aperture, while the
ladies are allowed to enter by a widely extended portal: What can
JAMEs Silk mean by this curious paragraph 1
“The soirées,” we are told, “will be dress parties, and to these no
members can be admitted in undress.” There is, however, a relaxation
of the rule in favour of the Lectures, Conversations, and Discussions; but
“as the presence of ladies is earnestly desired at each, some attention to
costume, as respectful to them, will be reasonably expected.” This is so
indefinite, that figurines, as the milliners term them, should be issued to
show the sort of costume that would be respectful or disrespectful to the
ladies. Highlows, we suppose, would be a decided outrage on female
sensibility; and the man who would force his society on lovely woman in
splashed Tweeds would be unworthy, &c. &c., of the name of et cetera.
BuckINGHAM himself always wears pumps, out of compliment to his
customers.
A postscript gives the dismal intelligence, that the Institute will be
what has been tersely termed “No go,” unless there is an “augmenta-
tion of members ;” and each member is entreated to “enrol a lady” as
speedily as possible. Husbands are called upon to bring wives, brothers
sisters, fathers daughters; and those who are neither husbands, brothers,
nor fathers, are urged to bring any “other relative.” But no ; we trust
there is enough of British manhood still left to prevent this sacrifice of
the weaker sex. Let us go through the labour of listening to Bucking-
º º
º:
_TV
HAM's lectures ourselves, but do not let us call upon our wives, our
sisters, and our daughters, to endure the hardship.
We perceive it is proposed to add a Journal to the scheme, “that
there may be a permanent record” of the proceedings of the Institute.
This seems the nearest approach to a self-sacrifice that we have yet ob-
served on the part of BuckinghAM. But if he really wants a permanent
record, has he ungratefully forgotten what Punch has done towards telling
the world what has been going on at the Institute 1
, PUNCH'S GUIDE TO PARTIES.
To those who are just emerging from the verdancy of youth, and to
those “young men in d. city” who wish to “wriggle" themselves into good
society, PUNch affectionately addresses the following advice,—commise-
rating the pitiable mortifications inflicted on young gentlemen whom he
has seen defiling drawing-rooms (consecrated to evening parties and full-
dress) with railway-pattern trousers and Blucher boots.-Keenly pitying
the situation of others who have found themselves in the very midst of the
uncivilised orgies of a bachelor's feed, adorned with satin waistcoats and
full-dress stocks,—he benevolently publishes an infallible scale of evening
dress, marked and arranged from the various terms in which invitations
are usually conveyed, that the inexperienced aspirant to elegant society
may no longer be at a loss.
When the invitation is in the following form :—
“Come up old fellow to my rooms, { You *}^*:::::: you please, from a Velve-
and take a chop.” trear teen shooting-jacket upwards.
A note asking you to join “A few ºr A black coat; but you need not change
friends to dinner next Thursday.” your Tweed nethers for black ones,
if you have not time.
Dress-coat and trousers, fancy waist-
coat, and Wellington boots.
Dress ditto ditto, white waistcoat, long
satin stock, brilliant breast-pin, and
dress boots.
You need not be particular. Surtouts
and coloured continuations won't
be objected to.
Same as a week's notice “to dinner"
with the addition of a pound's
worth of silver in a card-purse.
Blue coat with gilt buttons, black
trousers, patent leather ºn.
boots, satin waistcoat with gol
sprigs, white neckerchief, frilled
shirt, and two pairs of light kid
gloves for fear one should get soiled.
An MS. request for “Your company ->
to dinner ou Thursday week.”
An engraved ditto for a “dinner- ºr
party on Thursday fortnight.”
“A few friends to tea.” --
“An evening party—cards.” --
An engraved invitation on enamelled ->
paper in a fancy envelope, soliciting
“the pleasure of your company to
an evening party at half-past nine
o'clock on that day five weeks”—
with the addendum in one corner
of “quadrilles.”
As the greatest Reformer of the age, PUNCH desires that every member
of “Young England”—from the clerk to the Count—from the SMITHs of
the East, to the SMYTHEs of the West End—will get the above directions
printed in large letters, framed, glazed and hung up over their washing-
stands.
JUSTICE FOR WESTMINSTER.
"A connespondent of the Times complained, the other day, that
whereas the Lord Mayor had recommended the citizens to close their
shops on the occasion of her Majesty's progress to open the Royal
Exchange, the West End tradesmen, having no authority to guide them,
were in doubt as to how they should act. The children of the West can
know no better than those of the East what to do, unless they are told.
Human nature is the same on either side of Temple Bar, and is as
much in need of government on this as on that. Under these circum-
stances, Westminster naturally looks to her High-Bailiff; but what bailiff,
however high, can be considered her competent adviser . It is high time
to speak out. Westminster wants a Mayor, and must have one. A new
employment will thus be created, which will be just the very thing to
suit Lond Brough AM ; or, should his Lordship decline its responsibilities,
perhaps Colonel SIBThoRP would undertake them.
Trafalgar Bøuare.
ConsiderABLE excitement was caused at the latter end of last week by
the appearance of some real water in the basins at Trafalgar Square, and
it was rumoured that the Commissioners of Woods and Forests had so far
recovered from their long attack of hydrophobia as to have consented to
the playing of the fountains. On further inquiry, it appeared that the
water in the basins was occasioned by the heavy rains, and that the sup-
ply of the fountains was still among the remote contingencies which the
completion of Trafalgar Square appears to depend upon.
IF ABD-EL-KADER will return to his home at ALGIERs, everything
shall be made comfortable for him, and all his past errors forgotten, by his discon-
solate Governor, MARshAL BUGEAUD.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH...-OF TITLE BY PRESCRIPTION.
2= ITLE by Prescription
ſ Kºſh- 4 \ has been held by
| W º - some to be the title
W Z'ſ 2- which a chemist has
- | | - to charge for medi-
- - cine, because he has
generally the pre-
scription to show for
it. Prescription,
however, is a title of
which no one can
remember the origin
—a doctrine which
was very agreeable
to those pretenders
to the English throne
who found it conve-
nient not to remem-
ber that any one else
had a better claim to
it, and they carried
their shortness of
memory so far, as
very frequently to
forget themselves.
* The inconvenience
of having title by
prescription dependent on such a very vague business as a matter of
memory, induced the legislature to pass the 2nd and 3rd Will. IV., c. 71,
which materially shortens the time of prescription. A right of common
cannot be defeated by showing the commencement of it, after thirty
years; so that a donkey, who has enjoyed the luxury of a rollick on the
village green during the period alluded to, cannot afterwards be ousted
by a reference to the period at which he was first invested with the
Order of the Thistle. After sixty years—and it has been quaintly said by
all the judges sitting in Banco, that donkeys never die—the animal's right
becomes absolute, unless he has, from time to time, had the consent of
the owners. Forty years will give a right of way; so that if a man can
contrive to commit a trespass uninterruptedly for forty years without
interference, he may, at the end of that time, turn round and snap his
fingers at the heir or the tenant, whether in tail or not in tail, and all who
may come after him.
The use of light is indefeasible, if used for twenty years, provided the
window tax is punctually paid ; and, therefore, if I knockout a window in
order to pry into my neighbour's premises, my neighbour is justified in
running up a brick wall slap before it, unless he tacitly submits to my
impertinence for twenty years, after which I might batter down his brick
wall, if he attempted to build one.
It now becomes a question what may be prescribed for ; and, though
the jurists have laid it down that incorporeal things, such as rights of
way or common, only can be prescribed for, the chemists have laid it
down that corporeal matters, such as the gout, a cold, or even chilblains,
may be the subjects of a prescription. A prescription, before the recent
act, could only be claimed by him that had the fee, and he who has the fee
—being the physician—generally prescribes, so that the 2nd and 3rd
Will. IV. made very little difference in this respect. The lord of a manor
cannot tax strangers by a prescription; probably because the dose would
be rather too strong for them.
There are one or two other incidents attending a title by prescription,
which it is not necessary to name; for property is too well looked after,
in these days, to admit of its being claimed by others in consequence of
those to whom it of right belongs forgetting to look after it. Prescription
is, in fact, letting in number two, through the original owner neglecting
to look after number one ; but this is a piece of laches that very rarely
happens.

THE WAITERS AT THE CITY BANQUET.
It will hardly be believed that these functionaries, who were decked out
in all the splendour of pumps and pigtails, were paid only three-and-six-
pence each for their services on the occasion of Her Majesty's visit. We
have received a letter from one of those individuals, who alludes touchingly
to the misery of a crushed and impoverished heart sinking beneath a vest
of black satin. He asks us to conceive the feelings of a man with cur-
dled blood and curled hair, with silver buckles in his shoes and daggers
in his bosom, a velvet collar on his coat and the chain of poverty dragging
heavily on his heart: how was a human being, he eloquently asks, to
stand erect while stooping to receive a paltry three-and-sixpence? They
would have crushed him with the consciousness of his own littleness, and
yet required him to be at least five feet ten inches high 1 which was the
lowest standard allowed to the waiters at the Civic banquet.
PUNCH IN A FRIGHT.
The Humble Petition of Punch to the Greenwich Guardians,
sheweth,
That Your PETITIONER last week read a Report of a Meeting held by
your Board, in which your Vice-chairman proposed a motion for the
establishment of a Lending Library in the Union House. The motion
was carried. Fears were expressed by one very sapient member of
your Board, that Punch might find his way into the paupers' library,
if . sort of philanthropic humbug, as he thought it, was counte-
nanced :
Your Petitioner accordingly fears that he might be taken in, and con-
siders he should certainly be taken in if “an order to go into the
House” were left at the office of your Petitioner.
Your Petitioner is attached to his wife Judy and his child, notwithstand-
ing his apparent harshness to the latter, and would by no means con-
sent to a separation from them in his old age.
Your Petitioner lives by his Jokes. But he would not have the heart to
joke in a workhouse; and doubts if, after a week's residence therein,
he would ever joke again.
Your Petitioner is in the habit of speaking the truth, and calling a spade
a spade. He is therefore clearly unfitted for residence in a union
workhouse.
Your Petitioner would be apt to use his bâton on the heads of an oppres-
sive governor or pursy beadle, and has no reasonable doubt of being
urged thereunto in case of misbehaviour of said governor or beadle,
to the subversion of discipline in said workhouse.
Your Petitioner is used to the open streets, and cannot bear confinement.
For all which reasons, your Petitioner hopes that he may not be taken
in by your honourable Board.
And your Petitioner will ever pray.
THE QUEEN AND THE LORD MAYOR.
@ tical jart.
At the recent opening of the Royal Exchange, MAGNay, of course, wore
boots while riding in the procession, but on presenting the Address it was
proper that he should appear in dress pumps, of which he had a new pair
waiting to enable him to change on his arrival. The boots were however
what the French term trop juste, and not easily drawn off without a boot-
jack, which did not happen to be at hand; and the Lord Mayor, having
succeeded in releasing the right foot, was unable to extricate the left from
the unyielding Wellington. He rushed about the vestibule, frantically
calling on everybody to pull, and at length resigned his foot into the
hands of the City Marshal, who tugged away, with MAGNAY hopping after
him, as the Marshal's vigour on two legs overcame the resistance of the
Lord Mayor on one. At length the Remembrancer, pinioned his arms
while the Marshal gave another tug at the foot, but a loud exclamation of
“Oh, you’ll have my leg off l’ compelled the Marshal to desist ; and
finding it impossible to keep the Queen any longer waiting, MAGNAY
rushed into the royal presence with a pump on one of his feet and a
Wellington on the other. While he read the Address Her Majesty
observed the want of uniformity in the chaussure, and could not refrain
from a hearty laugh; but at the conclusion she kindly assured the Lord
Mayor that “the breach of etiquette was of no consequence, for it was
only typical of the fact that the 'Change was not quite completed.”
THE LAW OF STORMS.
The state of the weather in the metropolis at the latter end of last week
somewhat puzzled the meteorologists, who found themselves utterly unable
to account for it. On inquiry it turned out that a tremendous influx of
attorneys from the provinces had taken place, in consequence of their
being under the necessity of signing the rolls of the Courts in which they
purpose practising. The damp thrown upon London on Saturday, the first
day of term, exceeded anything of the kind that has occurred for a long
period. The elements seemed to be engaged in the maddest strife, and
the sun appeared to have got completely locked up in Chaucery.
A Good Sign of the Times.
Sir G. Hayter has received the Royal command to paint a large sign-
board for Windsor Castle. On one side there will be a portrait of PRINCE
ALBERT, with a dog and a gun; and on the other a portrait of the QUEEN,
with her crown and sceptre. The inscription on it will be :-
“House of CALL for Sovereigns.”
“An ORDINARY of Cnowned HEADs EveRY SUMMER at Seven.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S REVIEW.
Malibran's Pastille Papers : SAvoRY AND MooRE, London.
EcENTLY we have been favoured with a box
of lozenges, which, we presume, have
been sent us for the purposes of
review, and also to cure us of any
little hysterical attacks, lowness of
spirits, loss of voice, or tightness of
the throat we may be subject to.
We are sorry we cannot give the in-
ventor the full benefit of our name,
for the purpose of adding it to the
list of singers and others, who profess
to have derived benefit from the Ma-
libran Pastille. Not being very hyste-
rical, never having lowness of spirits,
being absolutely incapable of losing
our voice,—for, if the voice we have
in the country were to be missing, it
would be a national loss which no
lozenges could restore, never being subjected to tightness of the throat
—for we have a knack of eluding that tightness, and transferring it to our
enemies: (vide the fate of the Gentleman in Black in the street edition of
our exploits), considering all these things, we are hardly fair subjects
for the Malibran Pastille to be tried upon.
But if we cannot appreciate the merits of the Pastille, the Correspond-
ence connected with it forms one of the curiosities of literature, and with
this part of the subject we have much pleasure in dealing. The Lozenge
Correspondence brings into play the literary powers of many distinguished
persons, whose effusions we shall proceed to notice:—
We perceive, from a brief note, that MR. HENRY PHILLIPs has lozenged
with effect, and MR. John Wilson, though repudiating the habit of taking
things for the voice—certainly he don't appear to require any—yet he is
willing to admit that the Malibran Pastille may be serviceable to some of
his less fortunately situated brethren. MR. RANsford confesses his inten-
tion of relying on the Pastille during the remainder of his professional
career, and handsomely orders one box as an earnest of his intention.
MR. CHARLEs HoRN pleads guilty to having been unable to sing on a
certain Tuesday; but on Wednesday, the wondrous effects of one Pastille
had made him a very chanticleer. He encloses a portrait of his low G
before the Pastille, and another portrait representing the said G after
one lozenge.
MR. GEORGE HoRNCASTLE looks at the Pastille in a scientific point of
view, and goes into a learned disquisition on phlegm, with the apparent
effects produced on it by the Malibran Specific.
Miss VINCENT (the acknowledged Heroine of Domestic Drama) testifies
to the efficacy of the Pastille, which, when singing out for help as Susan
Hopley, gave considerable roundness to the tone of her shout, and
enabled her to ask for mercy from MR. DALE with much more clearness
than she could otherwise have thrown into her appeal to that most
respectable of dramatic tyrants.
MR. WILLIAM Cooper, a barrister, has found the Pastille beneficial in
removing irritation ; such irritation, no doubt, as such a barrister would
experience when bursting with the dignity of a motion of course, and
getting no attention from the Usher. We have no doubt that one pastille
would have invested MR. WILLIAM Cooper, the barrister, with all the
eloquence that the amount of his practice would require.
Miss DE PINNA has evidently been pitching into the lozenges, in the
absence of her uncle ; for she writes to say, that her relative is out of
town, but that the Pastille has been serviceable, not only to herself, but to
her uncle's pupils, to whom the young lady—in her uncle's absence—
has been dispensing them.
We must now close our criticism on the celebrated Pastille Papers,
which are valuable as displaying the different styles of the different—and
indifferent—professors who have had recourse to them. The letters will
not add much to the reputation of English literature in the present day;
but there is a pleasant relish for the lozenges apparent in nearly all of
them, which makes them, on the whole, satisfactory.
Gibbs and Guy Faux.
SoME sensation has been excited by the coupling together of the fifth
and ninth of November in the precept issued by the Lord Mayor against
fireworks and other proceedings that might be calculated to disturb the
peace of the city. “An inhabitant of Fleet Street for thirty-five years”
never remembers Lord Mayor's Day to have been included in this
circular. Perhaps it is feared that the custom of burning in effigy, which
is usual on Guy Fº day, may be extended to the day on which Alder-
man GIBBs commences his Mayoralty.
SERMONS IN STONES.
MR. PUNCH,
I AM an old Street. Why should I blush to declare my name t
—I am George Street, Bloomsbury. For many many years I have been a
fixture there, and I had good grounds for believing {}. a settlement in
the parish. I was in error. The Commissioners of Metropolitan Im-
provements cast their fatal eyes on me and my brethren. We were
marked for destruction 1 And now, after waiting in vain for some kind
friend to come forward in my behalf, I am compelled to appeal to you
myself; but not till havoc has been busy—not till one side of me was
dead and gone ! But still, paralytic as I am, there is life enough in the
side that is left me to protest against the wholesale destruction going on
around. My brother and sister Streets have sunk under it; and I am
told * our relations on the other side of Holborn have also been
visited.
What, I ask, have I done to deserve this I am old, they say. True ;
my inmates were poor, filthy, vicious. Well ; I grant it. My houses
were squalid, rotten, tottering to their fall. Be it so. But I was old !
Not a fissure in my walls—not a weather-stain—not a choked drain in me
but was hallowed by the touch of time. Why, then, should the protection
of antiquity be denied me, when everywhere else in Church and State,
town and country, at home and abroad, it is pleaded with effect, if not
vaunted in defiance? Tell the Lords or Commons, when next they put in
the plea of antiquity in favour of some vicious usage, or foully ill-used
right—“No ; George Street, Bloomsbury, was as bad and as ancient,
and she has been levelled to the ground.” Tell the Church, when
she points to her gray and crumbling towers, to deprecate the rude
touch of all reform—“George Street, Bloomsbury, was old and rotten,
and it availed her not.” If old Streets must go to make way for new,
let not old sinecures be sacred. Never let me hear again in the House
of Lords or Commons those great words of a great man, “Stare super
antiquas vias”—which I would render, “Stick to your old Streets.”
Levelling is now the order of the day, and, if we must fall before it, let us
not fall alone.
At least, if I am to be destroyed, let my inmates have compensation.
If they robbed, did not the Six Clerks do the same to a longer tune
When they were turned out of their snug offices, a refuge was provided
them at a cost of many thousands to the public. But for the houseless,
who are now lingeringly departing from me and my brother Streets, what
shelter have these Commissioners found –my one side is suffering under
plethora. Ten in a room I was used to, but twenty I find a serious incon-
venience. Where are my children to go? If I could see how they are to
be provided for when I am gone, I should die easy; but I do not—my
last moments are embittered by the sight of crowds who leave me to go
they know not where—to herd, it may be, under the arches of the
Adelphi or the trees of the Park. I was dirty in my habits—my drainage
far from perfect—my circulation (of air) irregular; but still I gave the
poor the shelter of a roof. Again I say to the upstart new Streets, with
their nicely stuccoed faces and heavy rents—hopelessly I say it—“Go ye
and do likewise.”
I remain yours,
MR. PUNCH,
GEORGE-STREET, Blooms.BURY.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH AND PALEY."
At a recent meeting of the Greenwich Union Board of Guardians, held
to determino as to the establishment of a library in the workhouse, some
singularly sensible remarks were made by a Mr. Adam Young. Mr.
ADAM Young averred—
“That he did not think the institution of a lending library in a union house was
at all proper."
Bravo! Mr. ADAM Young. We agree with you. Very improper, sir!
Highly improper | Preposterous !
But listen further to Mr. ADAM YoUNG. Tº
“It had been said that at Wandsworth a library was established in the union house,
and upon looking over the titles of the books there, he found Paley's Evidences. The
ideal To give Paley's Evidences to a pauper! The thing was absurd.”
Spoken like a man of sense, Mr. ADAM Young. To believe what they
are told to believe, without knowing what that is, is the proper religion
for paupers. PALEY might impress them with a positive belief in Chris-
tianity. The next thing would be, that they would pry into its doctrines,
and learn what they really are. Imagine the consequences of such a dis-
covery. Fancy the comparisons they would draw between the profession
and practice of their superiors. No, no This would never do. Keep
PALEY from the workhouse.
But softly. Can it be possible that we have misunderstood Mr. YoUNG !
Why, really, it would almost seem so. Hear him again.
“He supposed the next thing would be to admit Punch "
Punch and Paley's Evidences / Does MR. Young consider the latter
a jocose work; or, failing to perceive a joke in our pages, does he think
the former a serious one f His mistake, we apprehend, must relate to the
Archdeacon; for, in continuation, quoth ADAM—
“In looking over the Board table that morning, he saw Punch and two newspapers
lying there.”
Perhaps he takes PALEY for a periodical. Can he have confounded it
with the Morning Herald & We confess, we begin to doubt whether our
friend ever read Paley's Evidences. May we take the liberty of suggesting
that he might do so with advantage MR. ADAM Young may confound
ourselves with the Watchman, and Paley with Joe Miller: his argument,
notwithstanding, rests intact. Banish all comfort, every solace, from the
workhouse. Scout the notion of any sort of amusement there. As
to a library, laugh it to the veriest scorn. Food for a pauper's mind,
indeed It is quite enough to have to find food for his body.
The Great Wash I
At a meeting of the principal Pictures in the National Gallery, a vote
of thanks was unanimously given to Punch, for his services in calling the
attention of the Commissioners to the filthy and neglected state of the
inmates. They have, since our remonstrance, had their faces washed, and
every one will admit that they look all the better for it. All they have to
complain of now is overcrowding. If they belonged to the National Art
Union, or any other Union instead of a National Gallery, they could
hardly be worse off in this particular.
GENTILITY AT A DISCOUNT.
Respectability, everybody knows, means “keeping a gig.” An equally
concise definition of Gentility has long been wanted. The desideratum has
been supplied by a MR. Holden, lately examined before the Bankruptcy
Court. He was described in a certain bond as “a gentleman.” Primă
facie, there was no evidence of the fact—quite the reverse. The Com-
missioner, with that anxiety for information which distinguishes him,
pressed for the grounds on which the title rested. MR. Holden himself
seemed puzzled, but at last hit on the mark: He occasionally discounted
bills, and that he supposed was the reason he was styled gentleman 1
Punch's Court Circular.
PUNCH took his usual airing by rolling along the window of his own
. * throwing himself at full length upon the projecting ledge in
ront of it.
T º the afternoon he visited the new kennel in preparation for the dog
oby.
The dinner party at the office in the evening included Shallapallah
and the publisher. The Pandean band was in attendance, and played
several favourite morceaur in the outer passage. ,
We understand a company has been formed for the purpose of converting
Vauxhall Gardens into a bathing place, by bringing the sea-water up to
town along a line of railway. The projectors have been already in nego-
ciation with the directors of the South-Eastern for permission to introduce
a pipe into the sea at Folkestone harbour, and to run a main by the side of
the rails to the Bricklayers' Arms, with a continuation as far as Vauxhall,
where a resident turncock will be permanently stationed. There will be
branch plugs at some of the intermediate stations, and a ball-cock at each
terminus.
Vauxhall Gardens will be fitted up to resemble the town of Margate;
the fire-work ground being dug out and lined with zinc to represent the
sea, while a pair of flats at the back will realise the notion of the Marine
Terrace, with Buenos Ayres in the distance, and its romantic little oyster-
shop nestling under it. The entrance to the gardens will be converted
into a fac-simile of the jetty, and a pasteboard packet will be in attendance,
which will work in a groove, and give the visitors the idea that they have
arrived by steamer. A set piece will be arranged on the right hand,
showing the Bathing Rooms and Marine Library; to give effect to which
persons will be engaged who will shake a dice-box, exclaiming, “I want
but one—only one wanted to complete the sweepstakes ' " while others
make bows, and observe that the “sea is in fine order for bathing.” To
complete the illusion, Margate slippers and telescopes may be had at the
doors; so that the public will have an opportunity of realising, in every
particular, the luxury of a trip to that favourite watering-place. The wall
of the adjoining Hotel will be whitewashed, to represent the cliffs, and
some of the supper-boxes will be converted into chasms on the shore;
while cockle-shells will be profusely scattered about in all directions, so
that nothing may be wanting to give an air of marine freshness to the
locality.
PUNCH'S SENTIMENTS.
Sentiment for Young France.—The Ocean a French Lake, and England
at the bottom of it.
Sentiment for Young England.—A speedy return of the Middle Ages.
Another.—The art of suction ; and may our grandmothers prove apt
scholars.
Sentiment for Young ſreland.—May Federalism and Porter triumph
over Whisky and Repeal.
Military Intelligence."
PRIVATE SNooks, of the Guards, took his usual promenade for two hours
at Story's Gate. He successfully resisted the passage of a bundle across
the frontier line, and discomfited a washerwoman with a clothes-basket.
Immediately after the action alluded to he stood at ease, and was
eventually relieved by SIMMONs, of the same regiment.
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE.
We are happy to announce an increase of traffic on the Kensington
Railway during the last week. A passenger went with a carpet-bag by
the up-train : giving a surplus of one carpet-bag over the previous returns.
It is, we have been told, in contemplation to contract with a job-master
to horse the carriages on this line, thus obviating the necessity of steam ;
and it is supposed that one strong cob would be able to carry out the
objects of the company.

TRIUMPHAL ENTRY OF LORD ELLENBOROUGH.
By some strange inadvertence no account has been given by the journals of the
return of this gallant individual to his native land. We have much pleasure in supply-
ing the deficiency of our contemporaries, by giving the account of an eye-witness who
was present at the landing of LoRD ELLENBoRough.
On the vessel containing his Lordship being brought alongside the pier, a plank was
thrust into the gangway to facilitate his Lordship's landing. The Ex-Governor-General
of India was met in the centre of the plank by the agent of the Steam-packet Company.
who received his Lordship's ticket, while a Custom-house officer went through the usual
ceremony of asking whether he had anything about him that was liable to duty.
On placing his foot on shore, Lord ELLENBoRough must have been excessively
gratified by the enthusiasm of the porters, all of whom pressed upon him with an offer of
their services. His Lordship seemed much moved by the zeal of the worthy fellows, and
addressed them with considerable emphasis, the substance of his remarks consisting of
a recommendation to them to visit a locality even hotter than that of the place which he
had just arrived from.
His Lordship had scarcely concluded his interview with the Portsmouth Porterage,
when he was met by deputations from the principal hotel-keepers, and received from
each of the deputies an address—printed on a card—in which he was invited to avail
himself of the hospitality of the various innkeepers. His Lordship gave a verbal answer
to the deputations, in which he alluded to the expediency of adding to the police force,
and made a few other observations characteristic of the soldier-like bluntness he
enjoys a reputation for.
On arriving at his hotel he was received by two waiters carrying their napkins and
wearing the insignia of the order of the White Cravat, while the bells in the passage
rang a merry peal which lasted for nearly half a minute. After partaking of refresh-
ment, the Ex-Governor-General of India retired to rest, apparently much gratified by
the reception he had experienced, and not much fatigued by the ceremonies he had been
called upon to take a part in.
LApOur LOST.
THE Mansion House has been undergoing a thorough cleansing previous to the entrance
of the new Lord Mayor. Surely it was hardly worth while to take this trouble. The
task should have been postponed until the end of Gibbs’s mayoralty.
SIR PETER I.AURIE’s LoGIC.
THE civic House of Peers, videlicet the Court of Alder-
men, being assembled in solemn conclave, MR. ALDERMAN
Woop proposed that the evening sittings at the Central
Criminal Court should be discontinued.
The Worshipful Court hates novelty; and, accordingly,
MR. Wood's motion, being a sensible one, was rejected.
Among its natural opponents was SIR PETER LAURIE,
who, not content with a dissentient vote, obliged the Court
with his most sage reasons for the same. “It was ob-
jected,” said SIR PETER, “ that after-dinner sittings were,
for certain reasons, calculated to operate against rational
and judicious decisions.”
The “certain reasons,” ladies, are, a kind of confusion
of the ideas, a sort of mental excitement, benign or choleric,
according to individual temperament, by which Humanity,
having taken a drop too much at dinner, is liable to be
affected after it. It has been rumoured that Old Bailey
jurymen—nay, judges—have been known, who, having
dined, have beheld two witnesses in the box, and a double
prisoner at the bar. Under these circumstances, the
strength of evidence, the amount of criminality, and the
severity of punishment, may sometimes have been multi-
plied by two. Therefore are after-dinner sittings at the
Central Criminal Court objected to. “But,” argues SIR
Peter LAURIE, “it should be remembered that for several
hundred years not a single law had been made before
dinner.”
Exactly so. The old law of Debt, the ancient Penal
Code, the Statute Haeretico Comburendo, the New Poor
Law, the existing Game Laws, and a few others, were
doubtless made after dinner. In the same way, unfor.
tunate wretches may have been found guilty, sentenced to
be hanged, or transported, after dinner, who, perhaps,
would have been more fortunate before it. We do not
quite see the force of SIR PETER LAURIE’s logic; nor can
we refrain from respectfully recommending to him DR.
WATTs's useful lecture on that subject for perusal.
THE CRY OF THE PARTRIDGE.
“The Eagle-King may plume his wing,
Aloft on his granite throne;
The Vulture may boast of the warrior-host
On the plain, for his banquet strewn :
But the first am I of birds that fly,
For they are slaves to me,
In whose high hands are the good broad lands
Of the Island of the Free,
“Of Egypt old the Gods, 'tis told,
Were reptile, beast, and fowl;
And temples were raised, and altars blazed
To Ibis, Hawk, and Owl :
But in modern time, in a Christian clime,
I am a bird divine ;
And Christian blood in many a flood
Is shed before my shrine.
“My sacred ground they guard around
With arms of deadly strife;
And laws restrain the hand profane
That dares attempt my life;
A felon's pains, a dungeon's chains,
Await the peasant-slave,
Though by famine wrung, with children young,
And a starving wife to save.
“Then who so proud, of the feather'd crowd,
Can vaunt himself as I ?
The Idol-Bird, to men preferr'd,
For me condemned to die.”
So the PARTRIDGE sung, till the greenwood rung
With his shrilly notes of glee ;
And none said Nay to his boastful lay,
So rare a bird was he
" Calumny Refuted.
WE are glad to see in The Voice of Jacob, that the story
of SAxony's counterfeit jewels, is a shameful fabrication.
We hope that when the author of the calumny is dis-
covered, SAxony will double mill him.

PUNCH*S REVIEW.
Tecumseh - An Israel-Indian Tragedy—Life and History of Gen. Har-
rison—and the first Oration upon the Life, Genius, and Character of
Shakspeare. By GEoRGE Jon Es, Esq., M.R.S., &c.—Longman and Co.
Let not Mr. GeoRGE Jones, in the abundant vanity of his soul, believe
that in our review of this his last offence, we expend all our labour upon
him, Joxes. Let not his discreet heart think it. Certainly not. Punch
uses Jones's book as a farmer uses a polecat, a weasel, or other vermin ;
nailing it to his page,
as a terrible warning
to all of the unsavoury
genus. MR. Jones has
tried to make himself
public property, and we
shall therefore use him
to public ends. In fact,
we nail him up for a
public good.
Jonesis troubled with the lowest
plebeian disease. He has “an itch-
|ing palm” for titled people. Hence,
he is continually telling the reader
of the “hospitality” awarded to
º:-- him by kings, dukes, and lords.
He seems to be “taken in ’’ wher-
ever he shows himself. He dedi-
cates his Israel-Tragedy to the
Duke of CAMBRIDGE, and says–
“Those who have been graced as I
have, not only by the hospitality and the
proverbial urbanity of your Royal High-
ness, but by repeated interviews, wherein
º: ºwn. of a deeply-inquiring mind,”
c-N-c-
He makes the dedication “with pride, sanctioned even by humility.”
If he have failed in the work, the failure is owing—
“To the exalted character of the subject, which, like the electric flash, while it illumes
the darkest caverns of the brain, often has the power to blind perception.”
Thus the more the brain of Jones is illumined, the darker are his per-
ceptions ! Judging from his book, he must be in a continual state of
light-headedness.
We now come to the Preface, inscribed with a motto from “MS. in the
Vatican.” Was Jones ever in Rome, or is he in correspondence with
the Pope? However, in this preface, Jones lays lustily about him on a
portion of the Press, that “attack a young soldier in the path of fame from
behind coward walls or masked batteries.” Now, Jones, this is too
modest. You a young soldier? No, no; an older soldier we never met with.
JoNEs, like MR. Holloway with his Ointment, next proceeds to give
letters eulogistic of his Ancient America. MR. JAMEs, the novelist, has
written one, in which he tells us, that he bought the book “at the
recommendation of his Grace the DUKE of WELLINGTON.” MR. JAMEs
thus adroitly publishing his acquaintance with the literary Duke. JoNEs
next quotes a paragraph which appeared in the Times, in which it is
stated that Jones, when at Berlin, dined with the KING of PRUssia. We
remember the paragraph well; the quackery was headed “from a
Correspondent,” which, by the way, Jones has here omitted.
MR. Jones next proceeds to speak of a certain letter that, signed with
his name, appeared in our columns. This letter Mr. Jones vehemently
pronounces to be a forgery, because it contained bad grammar ! Now,
we put it to the reader (after he has read the subjoined) whether the
false grammar is strong presumptive evidence against Jones's authorship ;
for that ill-used man observes—
“The injurious effects of this audacity WAS proved,” &c. &c.
Jones next proceeds with his hero, Tecumseh :-
“If I should have succeeded in securing his statue in the Temple of the Muses, or of
History, I shall be content to have my humble name traced even upon his mantle.”
Jones fecit t Why not When Jones's hatter puts his name even in
Jones's hat, why should not the maker of Tecumseh put his name upon
Mr. T.’s mantle
Hear Jones on historical tragedy:—
“Such tragedies not only teach us to avoid tyrants from base and º: authority
[what does he mean?]; but they instructus as to the means employed by these scorpions
of the human family, to obtain their enre nomed AND poisonous power.”
Pretty well this, we think, for style.
Now for the tragedy itself. Well, Tecumseh has disappointed us. Its
whole character is tumid and extravagant; but in it Jones is more
frequently dull than ridiculous. The following, however, is a pretty
figure of a sympathizing tomahawk. Jessie loquitur :
“While in his death-struggle, the Indian threw his tomahawk; it came like the wind,
—I instinctively raised my hand, the weapon ed my wrist, and penetrated an aged
oak, where it remained quivering, as if in sympathy with its dying master!”
MR. Jones fondly hopes to see Tecumseh on the English stage, and gives
notice to all managers not to play it without his “written consent.” We
think the precaution a little unnecessary; as needless as to set man-traps
and spring-guns in a churchyard. -
Tecumseh, as we have before intimated, is vapid and tedious; but judged
by other scribbling of the same goose-quill, is not such rich burlesque as
we expected. The tragedy is enriched with notes. In one of these MR.
Jones trumpets forth his religion towards woman. He says–
“I have ever hesitated to form even an acquaintance with a man who should speak
harshly of woman; but I have with alacrity endeavoured to secure the friendship of that
man who should view a mother with filial affection; for I have felt convinced that that
friendship would be lasting, and I have never been deceived.”
If these sentiments do not endear Jones to very many tea-parties, then
are widows and spinsters dead to gratitude. Gallant Jones I. We would
have statues of him in little, made for such festivities, in Devonshire butter.
There would be a significance in both the statue and material.
In 1831 (we learn from these notes) Jones ascended “the mountain of
the Kaatskill, North America.”. The time, sunrise:–
“The entire, expanse of the vast valley was covered with a most brilliant silvery
vapour, which, being graced by the warm smiles of Apollo, became suddenly as a golden
sea, in which the Naiades of a fabled ocean might have gathered to witness the radiant
form of the Queen of Love, as sea-born she arose to glad the world with earthly bliss 1'.'
Cock-a-doodle-doo !
Jones gives the oddest reason for the authorship of The Life and
History of General, Harrison. Jones had sent intelligence (how very
kind of him () of the President's death to the Dukes of CAMBRidge and
WELLINGTON. They acknowledged Jones's letter, and he immediately
“felt himself in duty bound” to produce the penny-a-line biography
before us. However, the letter of CAMBRidge will show, the danger of
*...* loose grammatical company. HARRison's death, writes the Royal
uke—
“Must be looked upon as a great calamity to the United States, and equally so to this
country, as there is every reason to believe that he VERE not only inclined,”
&c. &c. &c.
Now, there is no doubt that the Duke once knew the English Grammar;
but then having had “several interviews” with GEORGE Jones, who can
wonder that His Royal Highness should have written the above Bad
grammar, like the typhus, must be catching ; therefore, let all men beware
of GeoRGE Jones.
We have not sufficient space to devote to all the blunders and extrava-
gance of the “Biography.” . We can only touch upon a few. The author,
it will be seen, is peculiarly learned in echoes. He says–
“The night-challenge was given in many parts—the Echoes alone gave back the
answer—they were repeated a second and a third time—the Echo, as if pointing to the
foe, still ANswer Ed “There !’”
What? Was the watch-word “there,” that Echo, pointing, should
reply with the same syllable Or what was the night-challenge to which
Echo so generously responded,—pointing :
Jones, in his own way, gives a high character of HARRIsoN :—
“The beverage of the fruit-tree assuaged those who were athirst,-his table was a
daily tribute to the poor, and the fire of his hearth warmed those whose only mantles
were the bleak winds of cold and cheerless winter.”
We must, however, hurry from the Biography to the Shakspearean
Oration. It is peculiarly full of broad grins. In his Preface, Jones de-
clares himself to be of English birth, and for this good reason :-
“American papers have declared that I am American born, and that they claim me
and my honours accordingly; and that I do not evince my usual chivalric spirit, in de-
nying my land of birth.”
This is true, that America claims Jones; for we ourselves read in a
late number of The New York Republic, that Jones was born in Bos-
ton, the son of a constable. Judging, indeed, by his oft-expressed desire
to keep the peace between America and England, there might appear
something in the story; but no, Jones declares that England shall have
him whether or no. Mark, however, his magnanimity. He says–
“Had I been base-born in Ethiopia, instead of the capital of England; had I been the
offspring of an insensate Hottentot, instead OF THE son [that is, according to Jones,
‘the offspring of the son”) of a highly intellectual English mother, the same spirit of
truth would have actuated me!”
We quite believe it—just the same.
It appears, however, that Jones made an oration at the Stratford
Jubilee, in 1836; he subsequently made a speech thereat, in which—rub
your eyes, gentle reader—he talked the following:—
“At the age of seven, I left this, my native land, for America, and after an absence of
seventeen years, I returned to England,—with a vivid recollection of the horrors of my
voyage, in youth, to the shores of Colombia,—for in that passage every grade of famine
had been experienced. As I conjure up the image of that horror, I can still remember
how my strength yielded to lassitude,-lassitude to melancholy,–till blindness closed the
scene of terror and despair I can still hear the wild shrieks of wretched,—maddened
mothers, as they cast the offspring of their affection into the vast deep, +the victims of
starvation: I can still feel the chill upon my heart, as my nearly fleshless hand was
placed within the DEADLY GRN, to draw forth the lot of life or death; and my mind
still bears the torture of the brain, as I followed,—sightless and tearless, a beloved
sister,-famine's victim, to the confines of her charnel-house!. Never to be forgotten
was the horror of sight restored, for it presented to my bewildered gaze, the terrible
spectacle of an idiot brother, a sorrow-stricken mother, and a maniac father 1"
Ships of course always carry “deadly urns” for such tragic occasions
as that painted by Jones—indeed, every passenger must know as much.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
But what we want to know, is this : since little MASTER Jones “at the
age of seven" with his “nearly fleshless hand” did not draw the fatal lot
—did it in reality fall to Joxes's “beloved sister f"—or if not, what are
we to understand by his following her, “famine's victim, to the confines
of her charnel-house !” MR. Jones is wont to be very particular in all
matters relating to his own importance, then wherefore does he not give
the name of the ship, the name of the master, dates, &c.?
We, of course, believe every syllable of the story. It is only that
MR. Jones may stand well with the world at large, that we ask for parti-
culars. Otherwise, there are people, who may put down the whole
narrative to the genius loci, and consider it one tremendous flam. We,
of course, are not of these ; nevertheless, names and dates, if you please,
MR. Jones. -
We now take leave of Jones; but that his book may be generally read,
it is our intention to deposit our purchased volume with a respectable
librarian (we shall duly give his name and address), that it may be hired
at not more than one half-farthing per diem. After this, can MR. Jones
say that we are unmindful of his literary reputation :
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER Tin E FIFTEENTH.-OF TITLE BY FORFEITURE.
very one is aware that
amid the numerous
games played by
the law is the
game of forfeits,
A of which it seems
there are eight
varieties, and if
variety is charm-
ing in the singular
number, the law
* of forfeiture, with
- no less than eight
varieties, ought to
be a most fascinat-
ing topic.
Property may
º be forfeited by
*I crimes and mis-
demeanors: such
as treason and
felony, drawing a
weapon on a judge,
or striking any one
- - in a court of
justice. It seems, therefore, that whenever the court is over-crowded,
and people on the back benches begin to push each other about
for the purpose of getting a place, and come to blows—however mild—
they are all liable to forfeit all their property, if they happen to have any.
Drawing a weapon on a judge is happily obsolete ; but we have seen a
disappointed suitor shake his umbrella at a puisne, behind the puisne's
back while attending a summons at chambers, which is in some sort
drawing a weapon on a judge, though “the books” are silent on the
subject. Lands may be forfeited by alienation, or conveying them to
another contrary to law, such as alienation in mortmain, or dead hand,
the term being applied chiefly to lands given to monks, who, as may
have been already observed, were dead hands at a bargain. The motto of
a corporation being “Never say die,” the lands could not be transferred to
a corporation without a licence. The clergy, however, soon set to work,
and concocted the beautiful system of fines and recoveries, which was one
of the most delicious bits of legal cobwebbery that was ever spun by
monkish mummery. Several of our early legal blue-bottles were taken
by these webs; and old Coke delighted to tangle himself and others in
the curious yarn, but the Turk's head of Law Reform has brushed away
the whole of it.'
Property may be forfeited by lapse, which signifies a slip; and “thus,”
says Selden, the proverb of “Many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip" is
verified.” How Selden makes out any connexion between the property
and the cup, or the tenant and the lip, we don't exactly see; but we should
be sorry to disturb the authority of any of those quaint dogmata that the
old jurists so often revelled in.
Another mode of forfeiture is simony, or presenting any one to a bene-
fice for money.—A sort of thing that is done every day by certain loop-
holes which the law, notwithstanding its pious horror of such transactions,
leaves to be taken advantage of. There have been some curious decisions
as to whether it is simony to bargain for a parson's living, when the
parson himself is dying ; and it has been held to be simony to treat with a
rector who is ill, though it seems that if the incumbent has only a
toothache there would be no simony in offering him “terms” for the
next presentation to his benefice. -

* Forfeiture by breach of condition it would be a forfeiture of our own
trouble and the reader's time to dwell upon, so we jump at once to for-
feiture by waste, which seems to be founded on the homely saying that
“You can't eat your pudding and have it,” for if you pull your own house
about your ears, you cannot very well continue to enjoy it. Tearing down
your landlord's wainscot and pulling up his floors is waste in the eye of the
law, but it does not seem that walking in his cockloft and tumbling through
the laths and plaster is such a waste as would amount to forfeiture.
It is also waste to convert one kind of ground into another, such as
meadow land into arable. And it seems that, by strict right, a paved yard
cannot have the stones torn up and mignonette planted in place of them.
It is otherwise with the gardens in the centre of squares, which may be
meadow to-day and arable to-morrow, because, as nothing will grow, there
is in fact no difference. -
Opening land to search for a mine is waste in general, and waste of time
in particular; but if there was a mine commenced, the tenant may dig
away with impunity. There is, however, an old case in the books, of a
plug-hole being on the estate of A, when B, the tenant for years, claimed
the right of opening a mine by virtue of the plug-hole. The point was
reserved for all the Judges; and Holt, Chief Justice, said “Pooh, pooh
the plug-hole is not large enough to let the tenant in.” Another of the
Judges followed with the observation, that “he thought at first there was
something in the plug-hole, and he had probed it very patiently, but there
was no soundness at the bottom. It seemed at first to savour of some-
thing, but if the Courts permitted tenants to wedge themselves into the
fee through such apertures as these, there must be an end to everything.”
It went off on this point; and the case has never been opened since for
argument.
It is waste on the part of a tenant if he cuts his landlord's timber :
but if the tenant cuts his own stick, it is sometimes waste on the part of
the landlord to go after him.
Another species of forfeiture is a breach of the customs of a copyhold :
as, where the rent is a peppercorn, the tenant must seek out the landlord
and give him pepper to the amount specified. The learned and facetious
Bracton remarks, that “Where the rent is pepper it is easily muster'd,”
a joke almost as venerable as the subject by which it is elicited.
The last method of forfeiture is by becoming a bankrupt, when every-
thing goes to the assignee, to enable him to declare dividends, sometimes
to the tune of twopence a pound, like black-heart cherries. A bankrupt
seised in tail has it instantly cut off, or at least so much of the tail
as belongs to him.

GRAND GAME MEETING.
(From our own Correspondent.)
Last night a very numerous meeting of the game of Lond Cop-
PEncAP was held in one of his lordship's preserves. The meeting
was very numerous: so much so that it would have brought the water
into the mouths of those wretched animals, destitute labourers, to
behold the hares, pheasants, and partridges present on the genial
occasion. They all appeared in their very best sleekness, and in their
finest feathers.
The chair was taken by the REv. Mn. SLY Puss (a jack-hare of
the very first respectability), who briefly stated the purposes of the
meeting. He said, it was impossible for them to witness the unceas-
ing efforts of the owners of the soil in the cause of all that was sacred
—need he say he alluded to the Game Laws (Loud cheers) without
feeling the heaviest debt of gratitude towards the English landlord.
It was to express this gratitude, that they had met. They could not
but feel that they were privileged creatures of the earth—beings
guarded by peculiar laws—creatures consecrated from the vulgar
mouth, and protected even at the cost of human blood and suffering
(Cheers). Hence their gratitude to those enlightened and patriotic
men who had protected them by statutes. (Hear, hear.)
MR. FINEwiliskER (a young hare, of very jaunty appearance),
moved the first resolution. Whilst it might be proper to express
gratitude and all that, it was onerous upon them to call for further
protection. The present laws were not sufficiently strong to appal
the poor and starving. Nothing could exceed the arrogance of the
lower orders: he himself had that morning had a stone thrown at
him by a famishing hedger (Sensation); whilst a friend of his, whom
he regretted not to see present, had, three nights ago, narrowly
escaped wires, evidently laid down by one of the inferior classes.
Something must be done to check this arrogance, or there was an
end to the best interests of the society.
Mn. Oldscut (a sedate, middle-aged hare), in seconding the reso-
lution, remarked that new vigour was necessary, otherwise “their
order” would soon be confounded with that of rabbits and vulgar
barn-door poultry. Though suffering under severe domestic affliction,
he could not refrain from appearing among them. A week ago, he
was a happy husband ; the meeting now beheld a disconsolate

widower. (Sensation.) The wife of his bosom had been snared from
him by a labourer: yes, one of themselves—for it was their common
cause—had been caught and killed by a low unlicensed person, and
devoured by a boor and his wretched family I Had his wife been
killed by a gentleman, by one duly licensed to shoot, he trusted that
he should have been the last of husbands to complain; but to be
butchered by the starving vulgar—to be consumed for a mere dinner,
not used as a dainty—it was too much to endure with resignation.
He could have been content to lose his wife to the mobility or gentry,
but that she should have been eaten without currant-jelly sauce was
too much for his conjugal affection. The speaker concluded by call-
ing for more vigorous measures.
MR. SILv Encrow (a cock-pheasant, in very bright feather) moved
the second resolution. He was not, he said, much of a genealogist
or antiquary ; nevertheless, he believed that his brethren were
originally of Asiatic stock; and if, indeed, there needed an argu-
ment to prove this, it might be found in the beneficent laws passed
by English senators for their protection. Was it not a cause of
gratification to all of them, that at that very moment the English
labourer was made a slave to them—that even the English farmer
was compelled to see them devour his grain, nor yet, but at his
peril, to kill or wound them : Had they not the grand satisfaction
of tempting the fingers of famine to break its fast and the law at the
same time : Had they not the sweet consolation to know that at
that moment there were scores and scores of men—husbands and
fathers—locked up in gaol, and their bits of household furniture
seized and sold—for indignities offered, ay, even to members of that
meeting Besides, if they had any wrong to complain of against
men in general, were they not sweetly revenged for the injustice;
for did not they, as game, tend to work more immorality, more
tyranny, more heart-burning (with now and then a little wholesome
blood-spilling) than any other beasts of the field, or birds of the air
For himself, he never thought of the men that he and his fellows
caused to be locked up for felons, that in the exulting feeling of his
high privilege he did not crow the louder for it. Nevertheless, with
the last speaker, he thought they should petition their landlords for
more vigorous measures.
MR. Shon TBILL (an elderly and very respectable partridge)
seconded this resolution. He said he begged to call the attention
of the meeting to a paragraph which he would read from the Oxford
Chronicle. It was to this effect; that—
“Rich And Nutt, of Postcomb, a lad about 15 years of age, was charged by PALM En
with looking at seven wires on the 15th of October. The poor boy said he was coming
down the footpath and saw the wires, and only stopped to look at them, but did not
touch them. Fined 15s., including costs, and in default 14 days’ imprisonment I "
The speaker observed that such a paragraph must be especially
sweet to the feelings of the meeting (loud cheers), as it assured them
of the more than paternal care exercised towards them by their en-
lightened landlords. Looking upon himself as of the aristocracy of
birds, he could not but feel grateful for such protection. Seeing that
the country had a superabundant population, nothing could be wiser
than to continually sacrifice the peasant to the pheasant. (Cheers and
laughter.) Instead, however, of fining a labourer for looking at wires
or at any game soever, he would stop the chance of such disrespect,
by compelling every labourer—unless upon lawful work—to walk
blindfolded ! (Cheers.) He hoped another session would not pass
away ere this was done. It was an axiom that could not be too
sternly preached, that the poor were made for game, and not game
for the poor.
The resolutions were passed, thanks returned, and the meeting
separated.
PARISIAN INTELLIGENCE.
“The Major-General of the Navy had issued an order at Rochefort, prohibiting Naval
Officers from wearing long beards and moustachios.”—Revue de Paris.
“The PRINck De Joinville will shortly set out for the Brazils.”—Do. nert day.
The excitement caused here by the above announcements is dreadful.
I am confined to my apartment. My portier, who is abonné to the Siècle,
is marching up and down the court as I write, armed with a shoemaker's
paring-knife, swearing he will have the blood of the perfide Albionnais an
quatrième. I find a difficulty in getting the most trifling service from
any one, and have had to black my own boots ever since these startling
paragraphs appeared. How it will end, I dare hardly surmise. Heaven
grant the storm-cloud may pass without bursting I send you some
articles from the Opposition journals.
[From the Siècle.]
“At last, then, the cup of outrage is filled to the brim. The Man of
Ghent has swallowed the bitter draught without a wry face. Ha! It
was offered him in a jewelled cup, by the hand of one higher than SIR
PEEL himself. Day after day, week after week, had France been bearded
by Albion—and now her insulting razor is to pass over the chin of our
brave marine ! The manly beard of the young hero, noble scion of a
degenerate stock, was offensive, forsooth, to the haughty insulars. He
had dared to hurl the language of defiance in their proud throats; and,
with petty malignity, Albion thus wreaks her vengeance France looked
for this consummation When the hollow greetings of the Château d’Eu
were reciprocated by those hollower hypocrisies of Windsor; when the
Man of Ghent grasped the hand of WILAINron, the blood of France not
yet dried upon its palm, France exclaimed, “What new humiliation is
yet left for us?' The blow has come. In every sweep of the razor upon
the chins of her naval officers, France feels a new rent in her banner;
in every beard that falls, a gem torn from her diadem 1 Yes, the prince
we revered abandons an ungrateful country, beardless, and seeks a foreign
clime. We would fain adopt a graceful custom of ancient Greece, and

j will elevate each hair into a relic, and wear it as a martyr's
record 1
[From the Quotidienne.]
“WELL did Albion know that the sword of vengeance was suspended
over her head by the beard of De Joinville, as the blade over the neck of
DAMocles by the hair of Dionysius . She has severed the hair-Why
has the sword not fallen In the name of France we ask of Ministers,
What hand intercepted the weapon Alas, it was a child of France who
with one hand cut the hair, -
with the other arrested the
sword in its downward pro-
gress.”
[From the Moniteur de
Brest.]
“ALL is tumult here. A
body of French officers
wearing beards, have just
now laid their swords at
the feet of the Admiral of
the station.
“The officers of the gar-
rison have muffled their
beards with black crape, to
mark their sympathy with
their brethren of the ma-
rine.”
[From the Journal de º º -

“Two officers of the navy -
have committed suicide.
They had shaved off their
beards in compliance with
the recent order, and wove
them into ropes, with which
they hung themselves in

throughout the fleet.”

JUSTICE AFTER DINNER.
HAs it ever chanced to the reader to attend the Old Bailey
evening sessions—we mean at that genial time, when the digestion
of Justice and the trial of a pickpocket may be going on at the same
time—when Justice, to engage her contemplation, has a dinner on
the one hand and a sinner on the other? If the reader have not
visited such Newgate Court after the cloth has been withdrawn and
the bottle gone its round, then does he not know the possible alacrity
of Justice. We have known her in the morning—may, up to the
time that that “tocsin of the soul, the dinner-bell,” has rung—serene,
self-balanced, full of the awful subject pending: and then Justice
has retired to dine. The dinner over, how very often does a different
Justice sit upon the Bench We have seen her with a roseate tinge
upon her cheek—a look of fulness—in fact, altogether another sort
of Justice to the pallid, nun-like maid that summed up in the fore-
Iloon.
Doubtless, it was some belief that morn and evening Justice was
not one and the same high quality, that, a few days since, caused the
question to be mooted in the Court of Aldermen, whether the Old
Bailey after dinner sittings should not be altogether abolished. The
proposition was, however, negatived; the majority of the Court
doubtless feeling that Justice never had so soft a heart as when her
belly was full, and that though proverbially blind, nothing so infallibly
cleared her intellectual vision like sparkling Burgundy, and fine
full-bodied port.
Besides, as we have said, Justice is so alert after dinner . We
have known some half-dozen prisoners, whose cases in an early part
of the day might have pestered the Court for some hours, we have
known them all arraigned, tried, and sentenced, ay, in comparatively
as few minutes . How often, too, has a Recorder passed a tremendous
i. upon an offender, simply because he has seen his iniquity
double :
The Late Rains.
By putting our umbrella into the fountains at Trafalgar Square, we
have ascertained that the quantity of rain fallen last week is just one
cubic ferule. This, if poured into buckets, will make 25 pails, 7 cups, and
3 saucers. This quantity has been drawn out, and pumped into the
Artesian well, so as to form a sinking-fund for the fountains when they
can no longer play in their old age.

has just completed a series of the most beautiful and significant Shawl Patterns, peculiarly illustrative of the benevolence of the employers

MR. Pu Nch has misery in every phase, and worked in all colours. Death's heads and broken hearts are most tastefully blended with
roses and amaranths, and picturesque starvation set off by gilliflowers and carnations.
Ladies who have a passion for great bargains, will find these Shawl Patterns peculiarly º

PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER XL.
FROM A GENTLEMAN TO HIS FRIEND, SOLICITING HIS SERVICES
IN A DUEL.
MY DEAR BRow N,
LET me see you immediately. A matter upon which de-
pends the good name, the honour, the all that makes this world
tolerable, requires that I should instantly consult you. I will, how-
ever, in as few words as possible, inform you of my present position.
When you know it, I feel assured that I shall have your immediate
sympathy—your promptest assistance.
This evening, taking a quiet stroll by the Serpentine, accompanied
by faithful Ponto, the dog suddenly jumped into the stream, and
swimming into the middle, remained there, swimming round and
round–you know what a water-dog he is—barking and snapping at
the gnats that danced about him. The superb fellow attracted much
attention : some ladies—among them two very lovely girls—stopped
in a carriage to watch and admire Ponto. They called him all kinds
of pretty names, and one of the girls, I was inclined to think, looked
as though she wished some of the praises to be shared by Ponto's
master. I am not a vain man, BRowN—I should despise myself if I
were ; but I nevertheless felt a very pleasurable emotion as the girl,
with her large black eyes, lighted up at the doings of Ponto, did now
and then glance approvingly at me. All this continued for some
minutes, and very pleasant it was. At length a gentleman—I sup-
pose I must call him so—came up to the carriage, and knowing the
ladies, entered into conversation with them. The girl with the black
eyes begged him to look at Ponto, who was still chasing the gnats;
the gentleman, however, scarcely deigned to bestow a glance on the
magnificent fellow, and what is more—leaning his arms upon the
phaëton door—he absolutely, and in a most marked way, turned his
back upon the dog, as I am now convinced, to pass a slight upon his
master. You know I am not a passionate man, BRowN ; certainly
not ; nevertheless, I felt I had attained what you are continually
preaching to me—some conquest over myself—when I suffered this
incivility of a stranger to pass unrebuked, unnoticed. However, this
was bad enough—but matters were not to end here.
At length, Ponto came ashore, landing where the gentleman stood
with his back to the water. On coming to land, Ponto—with the
natural movement of a dog—gave himself a vigorous shake, and the
water flew from him as from a well-twirled mop. Of course, much of
it went upon the gentleman, the ladies laughing at the dilemma.
My gentleman, however, in a burst of passion, flung out his foot at
Ponto, and wholly forgetful of the ladies' presence, cried “D–n
the dog.”
Now, Brown, you know I am not a hasty man—no, I think not :
nevertheless, I can suffer no man under any circumstance whatever
to damn my dog. Besides, in addition to the offensive word, there
was a violence attempted upon the person of the animal. It is but
little satisfaction to me that Ponto, by his never-failing agility,
avoided the kick intended for him, the gentleman by the ill-directed
violence of the action being almost flung over, that has nothing to do
with it; I feel that I–I, HEcton Montgomery, was attempted to
be kicked through Ponto: and that when the man damned the dog,
he most certainly meant the damn to reach the master.
- Under these circumstances, my dear Bnow N, nothing remains for
me but to call the offender. The laws of honour demand it : my po-
sition in society requires it—for how,-how, I ask, could I ever
again appear in the world unless this stain was wiped out in blood
I enclose you the party's card : but come, come instantly, that no
time may be lost. My honour festers with delay.
Yours, my dear Brown, ever truly,
HEctoh Montgom ERY.
LETTER XLI.
ANSWER TO THE ABOVE.
MY DEAR Montgomery,
I HAve waited on MR. GREEN, and have, I think, arranged
all matters according to the very nicest sense of honour. MR.
GREEN would not allow himself to be in fault, inasmuch as Ponto
was the first offender. Hereupon—animated by your spirit—I urged
that whatever might have been the indiscretion of Ponto, nothing
could have justified a damn and a kick. Such words and acts were
tabooed from good society; and therefore I begged to be favoured

with the name of his friend, that we might settle the matter immedi-
ately. MR. GREEN instantly complied with my desire; and in a
word, the meeting is to take place in Copenhagen Fields to-morrow
morning.
We have arranged the matter after this fashion. MR. GREEN has
in his possession a remarkably fine bull-dog, by name Fury. Now,
as Ponto was really the offending party, and I could in no way bring
MR. GREEN himself to meet the dog, it is decided that he shall
appear in the person of Fury to fight his antagonist. True it is that
Fury is in weight, breed, and bone so superior to Ponto, that I fear
he will hardly escape with his life. These odds are, however, in-
evitable in the duello. For instance, MR. GREEN never drew a trigger
in all his days : now, you can hit the stone out of a cherry at twenty
yards. He has heard of this prowess, and therefore is content to be
represented by his dog.
The meeting is to come off at five to-morrow morning, in Copen-
hagen-fields. MR. GREEN’s friend and myself have agreed, that
whichever dog shall be worsted, its owner shall be declared in the
wrong; whereupon—if life be spared—we have no doubt that a
reconciliation of the animals may be effected at a very small expense,
at the first dog's-meat shop.
I trust, my dear friend, that you will acknowledge the wisdom of
this arrangement; and, moreover, as you are a leading man in the
higher walk of the world, that you will exert yourself to the utmost
to make the practice general. If fighting be really necessary, why
not fight vicariously I should like to know how many duels have
taken place in which the honour, the dignity of human nature, would
not have been equally well vindicated if the antagonists had been
even terriers and turnspits.
As for washing out stains in blood, I for one know no process of
moral chemistry that can effect it. There never was so miserable a
mountebank as what is called Worldly Honour ! It is this quacksalver
that talks of washing wrongs out with blood, in the same way that
a jackpudding at a fair vends powder of pot to take out every house-
hold blot and stain. Both these creatures are impostors—with this
difference, that one is a zany with a death's-head.
If men must fight, let them fight by deputy. Let us leave what is
called “gentlemanly satisfaction” to be worked out for us by the
lower animals. Your very high folks might settle their disputes
with a couple of lions; whilst the vulgar might have their quarrels
satisfactorily worked out by cocks and terriers.
Indeed, how many a feud that has tragically ended with a bullet,
might not have been settled by a maggot race
Yours truly,
JAMEs BRowN.
P.S.. I shall send to-morrow morning at half-past 4 for Ponto.
Let him be well washed and combed for the field, in case of the
worst.
THE HONOUR OF THE BAR.
HERE is a good deal being said just
now about the Honour of the
Bar, as affected by the terrific
touting of some of the utters—
we do not trust ourselves to
supply the substantive to the
adjective utter — at the Old
Bailey.
The truth is, that the struggle
for bread and briefs among
some of the Central Criminal
Gentlemen would form a little
melodrama.
We give the following scene
from a grand Legal Spectacle,
of terrific interest, which is con-
stantly being represented at the
Old Bailey.

GENERAL WASHING COMPANY.
Report of the Provisional Committee of the , “General Washing Company,”
appointed at a Meeting of the Shareholders, held on the 1st of April last.
Your Committee beg to report that they have, deliberated upon the various
important matters referred to them, and offer the following as the results:–
That the Company be formed forthwith on a Capital of One Million, in shares of
10l. each ; the calls to be 21, per share.
Your Committee have to report that they had taken the Theatre Royal, Covent
Garden, where (in order to combine utility with novelty and profit,) the operations
of the Company will be carried on. Your Committee propose that the stage and pit
shall be amalgamated, and a steam-engine erected in the centre, for the purpose of
washing blankets, sheets, quilts, and other large articles; and that the suds be dis-
tilled by an apparatus affixed to the furnace of the engine, to provide geneva for the
washerwomen ; this, it is conceived, will effect a saving of at least 14 per cent. to the
Company. It is further intended to open the Theatre every Tuesday, Thursday, and
Saturday, that the public may witness the performance; and to giye due effect, the
women will be taught to keep time and wash to the music of an efficient band.
The following are submitted as the prices of admission :-To the dress circle, 9d.,
boxes, 6d. ; and gallery 3d. No drab hats nor bonnets in the dress circle. Refresh-
ments upon the usual scale.
Your Committee have engaged 1000 experienced washerwomen, and have ordered
50 patent carts, and a sufficient supply of buck-baskets, to fetch and carry the washing.
All disputes to be referred to the Ironing Board. Your Committee have also
determined upon taking possession of Leicester Square as a drying ground, and
have engaged two policemen to watch the clothes. -
Your Committee desire, lastly, to report that LoRD BRough AM has kindly consented
to preside as Chairwoman. *
A WERY Old of FENDER.
JUSTICE FOR KENSINGTON.
THERE is not a more loyal town; nor one that pays in its mite of allegiance to
the British throne more cheerfully, than Kensington. She submits pleasantly to the
almost paternal sway of PUMMELL, the beadle ; and the voice of sedition is never
heard within her peaceful precincts.
It is this which emboldens us to demand justice for Kensington. We allude to the
shameful darkness of the road, from Knightsbridge to the gates of the Palace; the
route has all the appearance of a now deserted, but once important thoroughfare.
There are still the skeletons of the lamps, with their broken lantern jaws and pallid
posts, standing up as if to protest against the indignity that has been offered them.
To paraphrase the line of Byron, it may be said, that on viewing the lightlesslanterns—
“We start! for gas is wanting here.”
Why Kensington should have been selected as a solitary victim to utter gasless-
ness, we are at a loss to discover. What has Kensington done, to deserve this oppro-
brium ? . . During the agitation of the Reform Bill, Kensington — thanks to the
moderation of PUMMELL–never forgot hefself. Had the staff been in other hands,
there is no knowing what attitude might have been assumed by this supple, but
sometimes ambitious suburb. -
Again, we say, the road ought to be lighted ; and we shall be obliged to turn some of
our light on to the subject every week, if gas is not speedily resorted to.
THE STRONGEST CLAIM.
A FRENCH philanthropist has just left a § to be distributed amongst persons
“t he most disgraced by nature.” Now, as SIR JAMEs GRAHAM dined with ALDERMAN
G1 BBs on Saturday, we strongly advise him to apply for it, as we are sure that
circumstance alone is quite sufficient to entitle him to it.
COMIC SONGS FOR LADIES.

While I sit before the glass;
Care can never reach the lass

Who thinks her face di-vi-i-i-i-ine,
Who thinks her face di-vi-i-i-i-ine;
Care can never reach the lass
Who thinks her face divine !

Corset lace and waistband strain;
But relief she’s sure to gain
Who thinks her form divine !
Chorus. Who thinks, &c.
You may call me vain and pert;
You may say that I’m a flirt:
Nothing can her feelings hurt

Pa, perhaps, may go to jail :
Care can ne'er her soul assail

Be my form with taste array'd;
Grief can never reach the maid
Who thinks herself divine !

FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED.
AFTER the Ball at Birkenhead, on the occasion of laying the
first stone of the new Docks, there was a general scramble
for the hats, bonnets, cloaks, and great-coats. It seems that
the waiters had helped themselves rather too freely to cham-
pagne, and, feeling their incapacity to fulfil their duties, had
gºne home at an early hour, to sleep off the fumes of MoET.
The consequence was, that when the ball was over, as the
waiters had taken the tickets with them, it became a very
difficult matter to distribute the garments to those who came
with their duplicates to redeem them. . In the utter despair
of a strict distribution, the whole articles left in pledge were
brought out, and thrown in a heap' into the middle of the
room. Every person fell to, and helped himself. Gentlemen
got four-and-nines for real beavers, and many a lawyer, who
came with a Chesterfield, was obliged to walk home with a
Wrap-rascal. One gentleman was compelled to put on a Dun-
stable bonnet and a plaid shawl, and, when he got home, was
refused admittance by his own wife. But the most melancholy
case was that of an old lady, who, at day-break had to walk
to her hotel in a dirty macintosh and an oilskin sou’-wester.
The company must have felt to a ticket, that if “property
has its rights, it has its losses, too,” when taken to an evening
party. The inquiries after hats, clogs, boas, and tippets, have
been very numerous ever since.
The Fall of London.
SoME scientific gentleman has just made the discovery that
London is stuck into a sort of clay-pit, and as long as the
clay is kept moist, the metropolis is all right, but directly the
water is drawn off, or dried up, the whole concern will
crumble to pieces, and London will tumble through into the
antipodes. We were not aware that our houses were
fastened into their foundations by so slight a hold, and we
recommend all who put faith in the theory, to swamp their
kitchens once a week, as a precaution against the possibility
alluded to. We always had a prejudice in favour of dry sit-
uations, but we presume marshes will henceforth be preferred
as building grounds. As we have been told by the pro-
spectus of the British and Foreign Institute that without
more members it will be swamped, we conclude that the
| looseness of its foundation must be regarded as a good omen
of its stability.

IDANIEL AND MATHEW.
THE TWO GREAT AGITATORS.
DANIEL O'Conn ELL and Father MATHEw
are the two greatest men of Ireland. No
Irishman — not even the self-loving MR.
GRATTAN, can, we think, question this.
Both, too, are martyrs.-DANIEL has suf-
fered three months' unjust imprisonment;
albeit the prison was no worse to him than
the rich cheese which a mouse once se-
lected for his hermitage, still the captivity
was unjust. MATHEw has spent a fortune,
and has been subjected to the defiling touch
of a bailiff. Here, on both sides, is mar-
tyrdom. DANIEL, however, wears his mar-
tyrdom with a difference. He has hoarded
bags of gold: he has, with MIDAs faculty,
turned the wrongs of his country into per-
sonal wealth ; and is exceedingly rich, only
because, Ireland has i been , exceedingly
miserable. '
Now, MATHEw the Martyr brought his
fortune into the market to buy up vice; to
bribe wretchedness into comfort; to pur-
chase, with ready money, crime, and pas-
sion, that he might destroy them. He has
laid out all his means, that he might make
Temperance alluring to an impulsive, whis-
key-loving people : he counts his tens of
thousands of proselytes, and then, taking
out his purse, he counts nothing. He has
triumphed, but he is a beggar. Taught by
his temperance lessons, the peasant and
artificer —ay, thousands of them — have
made their homes more worthy of human
creatures, and the teacher himself is shown
the way to a gaol. MATHEw is arrested for
- the price of the medals with which he de-
corated his army of converts—we know few
orders, home or foreign, more honourable, if
sincerely worn—and, unless Ireland arise as
one man, the reward of the Great Teacher
is the County Prison. -
The martyr DANIEL is, with his money-
bags and beagles, at Derrynane; and the -
martyr MATHEw, with an empty pocket, is
in the gripe of a bailiff.
It would seem that Fortune had wrought
DISAGREEABLE EFFrcts of A HIGH WIND-
THE LORD MAYOR'S OATH.
ONE of the most interesting features of
Lord Mayor's Day was the oath taken in the
Court of Exchequer by the late Lord Mayor
(MAGNAY), that he will render to Her Ma-
jesty a true and faithful account of the
issues and profits of his office as escheator,
and furthermore shall “well and truly be-
have himself in yielding the same account
as a true accountant ought to do.”
MR. BARox PARKE, while administering
the oath to MAGNAY, looked significantly at
Gibbs, as much as to say, “Well, my fine
fellow, how will you get over that part of
the business **
The tone of the learned Judge was strongly
suggestive of the fact, that the QUEEN was
not to be humbugged, and would not allow
the royal prerogative to be trifled with.
We nevertheless fear that Her Majesty
will find the Man in Brass a very awkward
customer. ...a
"LORD MAYOR'S DAY.".
THE tomfoolery of a Lord Mayor's Show
was never more conspicuous than in the
case of GIRBs, for though there may be
some excuse for the nonsense when the
thing goes off what is termed “well,” it
becomes cruelly absurd to lug a man about
in a great uneasy state-coach merely to hoot
and yell at him. GIBBs's position on the
9th of November was pitiable. It was a
case of pillory without the eggs — an
omission for which, by the way, we give
great praise to the populace. The people
acted sensibly in sparing their eggs, and
allowing the Lord Mayor to save his bacon.
The procession was a mournful piece of
business from first to last ; and the almost
incessant rain suggested the idea of Nature
in tears for the departed glory of the City
of London. The Ancient Knights presented
an appearance at once horrible and ludi-
crous. Rain and perspiration had washed
the rouge on their faces into large spots,
giving them all the appearance of having
been attacked by scarlet fever or erysipelas.
all this for the further glorification of MR.
O'Conn ELL. Lucky man that he is when
even the misfortunes of others conspire to crown him with a triple
glory. How often—with his heart beating in every word he uttered—
has MR. O'Conn Ell declared his everlasting obligation to FATHER
MATHEw, to the great Apostle of Temperance, whose all but miracu-
lous, influence over an ardent and impulsive population had prepared
the country to receive, as sober men, the holy draughts of patriotism
prepared for them by the great political Agitator. According to
MR. O'Con NELL, FATHER MATHEw has been to him a moral drill-
serjeant, whose glorious discipline prepared for the patriotic general
the great and certain elements of success. In O'Con NELL’s hands
FATHER MATH Ew has been the unconscious, although the invincible
weapon of Repeal When the Irish Parliament meet on College-
Green, will not such a gathering be the result of FATHER
MATHEw's Temperance, marshalled and directed by O'Conn ELL’s
Patriotism."
And therefore, if we know the man, we know that DANIEL O'Con"
NELL will immediately fraternise with FATHER MATHEw. What
does DANIEL write from Derrynane -
“FAther MATHEw must be relieved from all his difficulties—difficulties brought on
in the performance of that astonishing moral miracle, of which he has been, under Pro-
vidence, the instrument.”
And therefore, will DANIEL O'Conn ELL immediately on his return
to Dublin—“which cannot be before the 24th *—share half the pro-
ceeds of “the Rent,” with FAthen MATHEw.
The Esquires, in half armour, were arrayed
in a strange conglomeration of military mail
and civil seediness. Steel breast-plates clashed comically with
sleeves of evident cloth ; and the warlike buckler but half con-
cealed the skirt of the peaceful wrap-rascal. Greaves of metal
struggled, as it were, with trousers of the clearest, corduroy;
and the ankle-jack betrayed itself beneath the polished steel
legging. A knee of glittering brass was backed by a calf of
unquestionable Tweedish trousering; and the ancient knight was
swamped in the modern supernumerary. . The idea is indeed
ludicrous, of one ticket-porter as an esquire being attended by
another ticket-porter as a standard-bearer; while both are
humble followers of a third ticket-porter in a suit of chivalric
dish-covers, surmounted by a thing on his head, partaking about
equally of a knightly tin pot, or an heraldic jelly-mould. But if
bad went before, worse remained behind, for Gibbs himself came
last in the procession. It is time for these absurdities to be done
away with ; and the expression of opinion at the parading of Gibbs
may, perhaps, have paved the way for treating Lord Mayors' shows
in future with the contempt that is due to them. . . . . . .

MOON IN PARIS
ARAGRAPHs like the following have
appeared in most of the London
newspapers; how they got there
is a mystery we are not disposed
to dive into:—
--
\ “Mr. Alderman Moon, the well-
- known promoter cf the Fine Arts, and
the mover of the address of the city
of London to the King of the French,
had the honour to dine yesterday with
their Majesties at Saint Cloud, and has
been engaged to pass the evening with
the Royal Family on Saturday next.”
—Galignani.
We should be very glad to
know : — 1st. What are the
Fine Arts Moon has promoted
and 2nd, How has he promoted
them : The fine old art of hum-
bug is certainly indebted to him
for a more perfect development
than usual; and if humbug is
recognised as one of the fine
arts, we acknowledge Moon to
be a “well-known promoter”
of it. If getting pictures en-
graved, and assuming to oneself all the merit of the artist, be promot-
ing art, then has Moon promoted it. Louis-Philippe is a very good-
natured man, but he surely can't have Moon to dine with him in the
character of a promoter of the fine arts. His Majesty might as well, on
being struck with a piece of music played on an organ, invite the organ-
blower to the palace, instead of the composer, or even the organist.
Moon has about the same relation to the fine arts as the organ-blower
has to the music ; he only puffs away as hard as he can, thus supplying
the empty noise, while others promote the ability. Moon is a printseller,
and has made what money he has by selling prints; so that the fine arts
have promoted him, instead of his having promoted the fine arts.
TIIE PRICE OF A JAW.
ONE would think that Plutus made most of our English laws,
there are so few of them that are not to be mended with money, if
the breaker can afford the tinkering. This is, indeed, the true aris-
tocracy of wealth, and makes a man with gold in his pocket feel
that he is unquestionably one of the superior classes—in fact, a char-
tered ruffian, who may knock down his fellow-creatures like nine-
pins, if he have ready cash sufficient to pay for the sport. Blessed
privilege of wealth ! How contemptuously must the rich offender
eye the pauper ruffian, who can no more afford to enjoy the broken
members of his neighbours than he can afford green peas at Christ-
mas : Again and again do magistrates—by their judgments—call
upon us to marvel at the healing principle of gold—the never-fail-
ing aurum potabile of the police-office.
The subjoined case, however, applies, we presume, to a penniless
ruffian:-
“CLEakes well.—George Combes was charged with breaking the jaw of an unfortu-
nate girl named ANN: Goaxi.A.N.
“The poor girl was standing quietly in the Chalk Road, when the prisoner told her
to accompany him. She refused, upon which he dealt her such a blow with his clenched
fist as broke her jaw and felled her to the ground, where she lay insensible for half
an hour. She was then conveyed to a surgeon.
“M R. Comb E.-Will you make this poor creature some compensation for the grievous
injury you have done her?
“Prisoner.—I won’t give her a farthing.
“M R. Combe.—Then you will pay 5t., or go to the House of Correction for two
months.”
“Some compensation” for a broken jaw Geon GE Combes could
not, or would not pay for the article, and—we cordially hope—he is
a prisoner for two months, with the supplementary punishment of
hard labour. If, however, he could have paid 5l. he would have
been free to break another jaw the next night on the same terms.
The magistrates say they have no discretion in these matters.
If the ruffian hare money, justice writes him a receipt in full of all
demands.
It is the men who make these laws who are answerable for their
injustice.
Well, we will suppose it eight in the evening—the place, Palace
Yard. There goes Lond to his seat in the Commons. A
ruffian, thinking that he has a good quarrel with his Lordship's
jaw, with his clenched fist breaks it. Does his Lordship—the law-
maker—think the fine of 5l. a sufficient punishment for the atrocity?
We think not; but then, Lords are so seldom assaulted: such doings
generally fall upon the “lower orders,” and they being made of
coarser clay, are—like pipkins—to be paid for when broken. Men
with money can afford it.
We are pretty certain that MR. Thomas DUN.cox/BE must read
the police reports; and equally sure that the iniquity of this law is
wholly worthy of his reforming energy. Or where is Young England 1
Wherefore does it not champion the jaws of what Breeches Pocket
in its big complacency calls the lower orders 3
Commtrſial 31ſttrature.
AN advertisement appeared the other day for n Clerk, who was wanted
at Lloyd's, where he would receive a hundred a-year, and it was added
that editing Lloyd's List would be part of his duties. Lloyd ought to be
ashamed of himself to pay his editor so shabbily. It is true the List does
not require a very imaginative mind, or a very fertile fancy; but the
editor of such an important paper must be cognisant of commerce, im-
mersed in the mysteries of mustard, thoroughly ground in pepper, and, in
fact, a walking price-current. The man to edit Lloyd's List should be
able to see which way the wind blows without the aid of a weathercock,
and to discriminate at a glance between the various degrees of fresh,
squally, and moderate. The noble sciences of breeze-ology, wind-ology,
and tide-ology, should all be at his fingers' ends. He should be on the
constant look out for bits of vessels washed ashore; and as Hamlet knew
“a hawk from a hand-saw,” the editor of Lloyd's List should be able to
distinguish a figure-head from a marling-spike. No blacking-bottle washed
up by the tide should elude his editorial vigilance ; for some of the most
interesting articles in Lloyd's List have been written on the subject of
bits of paper discovered corked up in a former recipient of DAY and
MARTIN's jettest of all jets that ever were manufactured. Such should be
the mind that ought to preside over the putting together of Lloyd's List;
and if our contemporary don't strike for an advance, he is a traitor to the
press, a villain to himself, and a wretch to his family

FROM A SchoolMASTER IN WANT OF AN USHER TO A FRIEND.
DeAR Wilkins,
I AM getting on pretty well-boys are
dropping in-but I am terribly in want of an usher.
The fellow I have just got rid of spoke disrespect-
fully of our suet-dumplings, and so set a fatal ex-
ample of insubordination to the pupils. Moreover,
when the boys played at trap-ball and cricket, he
had, I discovered, a knack of lying down upon
the grass, and doing nothing but stare at the
sky—as if he had any business with that. So he's gone, and a capital
riddance. -
I never can thank you enough, my good friend, for your advice to
go into the academy business. I had no notion that the trade was so
easy. When I failed in my own line—and from no defect of minº,
Wilkins, for there wasn’t a bootmaker that I'd turn my back
upon—I thought I was ruined outright. Little, did I then dream
that the trade of schoolmaster seemed made by Providence for

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
unfortunate tradesmen who had failed in everything else. Little
did I think that so many nice academies I could name—with their
Venetian blinds and bright brass knockers, and hearth-stoned steps,
and all so nice as if learning was the neatest and cleanest employ-
ment in the world,—little, I say, did I think that these places were
little more than very handsome almshouses, supported by good-
natured parents, for the unfortunate and helpless. But it is wonderful
to see the confidence of fathers and mothers | When I was a boot-
maker, the trouble I used to have with my customers l—now, all
goes as smooth with 'em as neat's-foot oil.
I'm certain of it, WILKINs ; yes, it does seem to me in human
nature, that folks think more of their own corns, than of the children
of their flesh. When I was in business, the fuss and fuming I used
to have if a boot pinched a little ! How my customer would storm
and bluster | What anxiety, too, would he show when being mea-
sured ; how many questions he would put to me, as though to come
at my abilities for a good fit. I’ve known, too, some bold-faced peo-
ple ask for references. Ha! those were days of worry and weari-
mess; nothing of the sort now. No, no; fathers and mothers bring
their little boys, and take it as a matter of course, that they’ll have
all manner of Greek, and Latin, and mathematics, and geography
crammed into them. The parents have made up their minds to pay
for the articles, and with a trustingness, which in this mean world is
quite delightful, they believe the things will be delivered. It is quite
enough for them, that the schoolmaster offers the goods—they never
stop to inquire if the commodities are of the right sort. Folks don't
buy even cabbages after this fashion; but then, children are not
cabbages.
You will see, dear WILKINs, that I am in the best spirits with my
new business; and I never can forget what I owe to you as an old
academy master—a venerable birch, as I have heard you called with
the deepest respect. Learning is, indeed, a delightful refuge against
the disappointments and vexations of the world. How little did I
think when I paid sixpence in the pound, of the future cosiness in
store for me in Crichton House ! How little did I dream that, having
been tossed upon the deceitful waves of trade, I should here sit in a
nice library—(according to your directions I make it a sort of show-
room for my boys' parents: when they see so many books on my
shelves, they of course think I’ve a good many of them in my head)
—a library smelling so of russia-leather, that it’s difficult not to
think one's-self a scholar. And all this, my excellent friend, I owe to
you. t
Pray add to the kindness, and find me out an usher. You know
exactly the sort of animal that is required in so handsome an esta-
blishment as mine. Hoping that you will soon pick him up for me,
I remain, your obliged friend,
JAcob Awl.
LETTER XLIII.
ANSWER TO THE FOREGOING.
DEAR JAcob,
I AM by no means surprised to hear that your usher is
gone. I never liked the fellow : there was a great deal too much
conceit in him. I once heard him talk very high about gentlemanly
feelings; and so prepared myself to be startled at nothing. However,
there is plenty of such cattle as you want in the market, and depend
upon it, you’ll soon be suited.
I am glad to find that you like your new business; but haſ Jacob
—good as it is for folks in your strait, boarding-school work is n’t
half so good as it was. I remember when I was flourishing forty
years ago: they were the times. Then there was no talk of march
of intellect—no slang, vulgar nonsense about a schoolmaster being
abroad; as if, indeed, he has any business to be abroad no impudent
interlopers setting up proprietary schools to the injury of the regular
master. No : in those days the people who had been sent to school
were at once acknowledged to be people of the better sort—people
of education. There was no disputing about the matter. And then
for the Universities, why, then they were places for gentlemen. It
was enough to say “an Oxford man,” “a Cambridge man;” and
folks at once allowed him to be a superior, a very extraordinary
person. But now, what a revolutionary change A man now,
whether from Oxford or Cambridge, can't pass for a conjuror, unless
he shows his tricks. People in these uncivil times have a vulgar
habit of asking, “What has he done " It was not so in my day.
However, bad as things are in the scholastic profession—lowered
as they are—let us thank our stars, they are better here than in that
wretched, frog-eating, wooden-shod country, France. There, indeed,
—and I believe in other parts of the tyrannical Continent—there is
no liberty for learning: none at all. For instance, JAcob—You, at
Crichton House, profess to teach all dead and living languages,
mathematics, geometry, and all that. Well, and parents are con-
tented to take your word upon the matter; with a straightforward
John Bullism they don’t put any impertinent questions. Now, how
would it be with you in France, JAcob Why, you’d have been
had up to a board, a committee, or something of the sort; and there
you'd have been examined and searched, and your brains turned
inside out, to see if there was that in 'em that you set up to teach.
If there wasn't, why you’d been fined and clapt in gaol for trying
to deal in learning without a licence. And therefore, Jacob,
after all, let us be thankful that we live in a free country; in a
happy land where the government—however sharp it may look
after adulterated tobacco and illicit gin—does not interfere with
the liberty of the subject; but permits him to trump himself off
as knowing all sorts of things, leaving it to the rest of the world
to find him out if they can. Yes, Jacob ; night and morning
return thanks that you are a free-born Briton. Had you been a
bankrupt Frenchman, you must have sunk to the lowliness of a
cobbler; you would have been mending the shoe-leather of your
species in some hut or cellar, and not living in lamb's-wool, doing
nothing, in Crichton House. And for this comfort, JAcon, never
forget that you are indebted to a bountiful government.
As for the usher, it has just come into my mind that I know a
young man who will suit you. He is meek, civil, and a very small
eater. I will immediately write to him, and you shall have his
answer.
Your sincere old friend,
MAT THEw WILKINs.
P.S.–I shall venture to offer the young man 201. a year.
MAYORALTY AT A DISCOUNT.
The city of York is likely to undergo all the horrors of an inter-
regnum, for want of a chief magistrate. Our advices from that ancient
city inform us that a sort of Mayorophobia has broken out among the
aldermen, who are resigning, and paying the fine, one after the other, as
fast as they are chosen to wear the civic purple. Nothing can exceed the
excitement into which York has been thrown by the refusal of the
members of the corporation to wield the mace of office; and it is feared
that the city must be handed over to the inspector of police, which will at
once establish a semi-military despotism.
There is only one way of accounting for the reluctance of the citizens
to assume the mayoral dignity, and that is, by attributing it to the dis-
credit which has lately been thrown on the office of Lord Mayor by what
has taken place in London.
A. Comparison.
ARABIA's desert we may well compare
Unto Trafalgar's fountains in the Square ;
For place the traveller in either quarter,
He would in vain seek for a drop of water.
THE TENURE OF OFFICE.
LoRD STANLEY is advocating the principle of the “Fixity of TENURE.”
Tais is slightly at variance, we think, with his recent expulsion from
Downing Street.

| FROM THE LORD MAYOR. To THE TRUMPETS AND DRUMS OF THE
- LIFE GUARDS.
Mansion-House, Nor. 11, 1844.
GENTLEMEN, AND My GooD FRIENDs, The procession past—
the dinner over (why SIR. Robert PEEL did not attend, I cannot
discover)—and the sermon of ceremony heard (though not at St.
Stephen's, Walbrook, for they do tell me that the church isn’t safe),
my next duty is to render thanks to you. Since WHITTING Ton’s
cat was kittened, never did Lord Mayor owe so much to brass and
parchment Yes, gentlemen, I feel myself to be your debtor for
life; and moreover, gentlemen, I am content to feel so.
It is now no secret that a coarse, malignant multitude—a flock of
human geese—did on the 9th inst. assemble to hiss me. My dear
friend, the Editor of the Morning Herald, who really knows what a
goose can do—says there was no hissing whatever : other people—
but I know their prejudice—protest there was. However, thanks
to you, gentlemen, it was to me a matter of perfect indifference;
for albeit every man might hiss like a steam-engine, I—praised be
your brass and parchment—heard it not. Never was malice more
triumphantly vanquished by blowing and beating !
And here let me digress, that I may thank two enthusiastic young
men in Highland attire, who, on Ludgate Hill, played the bagpipes
most tremendously. Their gratuitous devotion on the occasion
must be acknowledged by all, for even my enemies cannot say that
I would pay the piper.
To return, gentlemen, to you, who were, on the eventful ninth,
the instruments of my exceeding happiness: I cannot express to you
the more than placid delight that pervaded my soul, as, sunk back in
a corner of the carriage, I closed my eyes to the rabble without,
and was conscious of nothing but your delightful sounds. I felt
that I was undergoing a great trial—I did, I confess it, as the coach
lumbered along, now and then reflect upon the uneasy rides that
sinners had once taken to Tyburn ; but the reflection suddenly
passed, and I felt my whole physical and moral being resonant and
tingling with brass : My heart was stirred and glowed as the con-
genial metal brayed to it. I felt arrayed from head to heel in the
soul-sustaining substance, and thus—to my mind, etherially clad
—what knew I of the taunts, the coarseness, the hootings, the
sibilations of an unreflecting mob, whose vulgar mind is tied down
to this world and its small and dirty doings, by the trammels of
arithmetic |
What cared I for the Rule of Three, whilst you, gentlemen, blew
and beat Rule Britannia
Gentlemen, you may have often blown and bled for your country
- moral victory : for what were
the execrations of a mob against your matchless instruments on
the immortal ninth of this November Gentlemen, with heart-felt,
pocket-felt gratitude, I remain,
but never did you obtain so great a
Your affectionate Friend,
GIBBs, Mayor.
P.S.–Understand that I engage you for the next ninth, when I
GO OUT.
ST R E E T TH O U G HT S.
BY A SURGEON.
IN perambulating Oxford-Street or Holborn, what a number of little
ragamuffins I observe trundling their hoops . With what interest I con-
template their youthful sport; particularly when I regard its probable
consequences ! A hoop runs between a gentleman's legs. He falls.
When I reflect on the wonderful construction of the skeleton, and consider
to how many fractures and dislocations it is liable in such a case, my
bosom expands with gratitude to a considerate police, to whose non-
intervention we are indebted for such chances of practice l
The numerous bits of orange peel which diversify the pavement oft
attract my attention. Never do I kick one of them out of the way.
The blessings of a whole profession on the hands that scatter them | Each
bit may supply a new and instructive page to the Chapter of Accidents.
Considering the damp, muddy, state of the streets at this time of the
year, I am equally amazed and delighted to see the ladies, almost univer-
sally, going about in thin shoes. This elegant fashion beautifully displays
the conformation of the ankle-joint; but to the surgeon it has another
recommendation. I behold the delicate foot, separated scarcely by the
thickness of this paper from the mire. I see the exquisite instep,
undefended but by a mere web. I meditate on the influence of cold
and wet upon the frame; I think of the catarrhs, coughs, pleurisies,
pneumonies, consumptions, and other interesting affections, that neces-
sarily must result from their application to the feet; and then I reckon
up the number of pills, boluses, powders, draughts, mixtures, leeches, and
blisters, which will consequently be sent in to the fair sufferers, calculate
what they must come to, and wish I had the amount in my pocket.
SONG OF THE LONDON CORN EXCHANGE.
How markets alter by degrees
Experience makes us find:
This week the duty paid on peas
Has sensibly declined.
The holder of the foreign wheat
Not yet his price abates,
But firmly has refused to treat,
Except on the old rates.
Barley is now in fair request,
But second sorts are dull;
In every species but the best
The buyer has the pull.
Five vessels laden with the oat
(It is the Irish sort)
At present in the harbour float,
And grace the busy port.
Then hey for commerce, corn, and wine !
Where'er the ocean laves,
Our native land is sure to shine,
“BRITANNIA RULES THE waves.”

The health of towns commission, in order to come at the diseases
induced by living in cellars, have sent Professor FAIRPLAY down to
Manchester to investigate the subject. The learned Professor now
occupies the chair of Rheumatics in a cellar under the Royal Institution.
He has been eminently successful in his labours, having already caught
15 catarrhs, 12 sore throats, 9 coughs, and 3 inflammations of the lungs.
It is thought that the capture of a few more of these interesting specimens
will do for him.
A CAPITAL HASH.
A New sauce is advertised under the title of “SIR Robert Peel's
Sauce.” It has been concocted, we believe, from his promises that the
Income-Tax should not last longer than three years.

ENEvoleNT persons, in this instance
more ready to mind other people's
business than their own, have
founded a Visiting Society for the
Rich. It employs upwards of a
thousand visitors, who force them-
selves into the houses of the wealthy,
inquire into their circumstances, give
them advice whether they want it or
not, and distribute tracts among
them. The Bishop of LoNDoN being
otherwise engaged, MR. Punch has
been made President of this Society.
The nature of its operations will ap-
pear from the annexed report of one
of Punch's lay readers, whose sphere
of usefulness is St. George's, Hano-
ver-square :-
“The results of your missionary's
labours are, he regrets to say, very
painful. A distressing amount of
destitution, moral and intellectual,
exists in the district under his in-
spection. Of a hundred persons
interrogated by your missionary re-
specting their duties towards society,
ninety-nine replied that they con-
sisted in maintaining an appearance
in it. Many, when asked where they
expected to go to, said they really
did not know ; others had not
quite made up their minds; some
answered to Cheltenham or
BADEN-BADEN, and several named
a concert or a soirée. A Baronet, with ten thousand a year, understood
by charity the obligation of paying the Poor's rates; and his Lady, the
necessity of patronising fancy fairs. A fashionable preacher, residing not
ten yards from a court whose inhabitants were starving, had no idea who
lived in it. Of fifty individuals who attended a place of worship, forty-
eight admitted that they went there in their carriages. Nineteen out of
twenty infants had been abandoned to nurses.
“Much physical distress exists among the rich population. Languor,
low spirits, fainting, and headach, are almost universal in boudoirs and
drawing-rooms. Their cause may be traced to ill-ventilated salons, over-
work and excitement in dancing, polkas and waltzes, and to the dire
necessity of tight-lacing. Both sexes are sadly troubled with imaginary
complaints, which too often render them the prey of designing physicians.
“Pecuniary, embarrassment, strange as it may seem, is common
among the rich. Your missionary has an idea that this may be, in some
measure, connected with their large house-rents, the number of carriages
and servants kept, the frequent parties given, and the expense incurred
in dresses and jewellery. He suspects that a box at the Opera (a
necessary of fashionable existence) may sometimes be one source of
difficulty. Another, perhaps, may be the number of improvident mar-
riages almost daily solemnised at the parish church. A rash gentleman
often marries a lady with three thousand a-year, who spends five : the
consequence is obvious. Your missionary has visited several hundreds
of first-rate houses ; in some cases with an introduction, in others having
introduced himself. He has walked up, unasked, to evening parties; he
has intruded on families just sitting down to dinner. He has asked all
sorts of questions, without regard to delicacy; he has given much advice,
little of which has been taken; and he has distributed numerous tracts,
whereof most have been flung in his face.”
Father Thames in a Rºess.
A chARge of partiality has been got up against the Thames, which is
alleged to have been recently guilty of a series of partial overflows. We
have, however, ascertained that the venerable father has distributed his
exuberance along the Belvidere Road, with considerable impartiality,
having turned the saucepans under all the kitchen dressers in that locality
into so much floating capital. The only part of the business that really
does seem to savour of partiality, is the fact that the overflow has been
effected by spring tides, which is rather going out of the way at a period
when autumn tides would have been far more natural.
PUNCH*S REVIEW.
The Commercial Phenomenon.
The Mosaic literature of the day is just now divided between George
Jones, who has just published (we beg pardon, we meant to say printed)
an Israel-Indian Tragedy, and Messrs. Moses and Son, who have just
produced their usual half-yearly Treatise on Cheap Clothing. . The
Tecumseh of MR. George Jones having had its turn last week in the
pages of Punch, that work and its author must give place to the Com-
mercial Phenomenon of Messrs. Moses and Son. By the way, we cannot
help calling attention to the similarity in the style of the two productions.
Jones (in his preface) boasts of the favours he has received—so do
Moses and SoN. Jones talks proudly of his own achievements—so do
Moses and SoN. But Jones bursts the bonds of LINDLEY MURRAY-a
boldness that Moses and SoN have not yet aspired to.
We must, however, confine ourselves for the present to the Commercial
Phenomenon. On the whole, it seems more ambitious than the previous
works of the same authors; there is less playfulness and more business;
the poetry occupies a smaller and the lists of prices a larger space than
has hitherto been assigned to them. Not that we have to complain of
any dearth of fiction, for the cheapness of the goods is insisted on with
the same pertinacity as heretofore. The preliminary chapter takes a
retrospective glance at the names which Moses and SoN have given to
their establishment, and puts forth reasons for selecting a new title every
year. The practice of assuming numerous aliases is a very ancient one.
If we remember rightly, Ikey Solomons changed his name frequently :
and whatever Ikey would do, Moses and SoN are certainly at liberty
to imitate. The new title that has been chosen by these individuals
is the Commercial Phenomenon—an appellation we look upon as par-
ticularly appropriate; for the business of Moses and Son has always
appeared to us a commercial phenomenon there is no accounting for.
As Moses AND SoN evidently are of opinion that they deserve some-
thing, we have had a design drawn for a Moses testimonial.
Moses and Son. Small quarto.
VALUABLE TESTIMONY IN FAVOUR OF THE ALLOTMENT SYSTEM.
SIR CHARLes NAPIER considers that nothing will so much tend to
ameliorate the condition of the labouring classes, as the allotting to them
small portions of land. The gallant officer says that some time since he,
with certain others, took an Acre,
which has been quite the making
of them.

S O N S OF C L O R Y .
RECRUITING AT BIRMINGHAM.
FIAlf-a-chown obtained under false pretences commonly con-
signs the impostor to dreary limbo. Men, on the other hand, may
be tricked from their families and themselves, and the sharper be
rewarded for the juggle. To be sure, there is property in the half-
crown piece : look at the royal countenance in its sweet compla-
cency—listen to the metallic music of the ring: it beams and
vibrates, property; but where is the property in human bodies moved
by human breath The cheater in goods and chattels is abominated,
punished. Now the recruiting-sergeant is an allowed man-stealer, a
permitted swindler, with streamers in his cap.
... Within these few days, Glory has hung out her promissory wreaths
at the King's Arms, Steelhouse Lane, Birmingham. Glory has hung
the walls with invitations to enlist. Yes; the old harridan has put
her trumpet to her lying mouth, and once more played the familiar
air of “Ducky, ducky, ducky, come and be killed.” Listen to the
strain :—
“WANTED, 500 unmarried, handsome, and gay young fellows, from 18 to 25 years of
age, for Her Majesty's 55th REGIMENT of Foot.”
In these days of peace, Glory has become squeamish in her tastes.
Or, perhaps, the bullets are particular, and, like the fair, prefer above
all, handsome and gay young fellows.
“Those who are of a rovinz mind, and wish to see the world, a better opportunity
cannot offer. The Bounty is risen to all such as are willing to enter this gallant corps,
whose honourable services in every quarter of the globe have often been so highly spoken
of, and laurels gained, too NUM ERous To MENTion : therefore, all who have a good
and honest heart, follow the example of those you now see enrolled in the ranks of the
royal corps, with flowing streamers in their caps, the true emblems of valour, courage,
and fidelity 1"
And thus is man, the paragon of animals, led to be shot at, by
flowing streamers, by valour, courage, and fidelity, at sixpence per
yard I
“Any gallant young fellow so disposed, will apply to Serjeant O’NAIll, ſominous
name!] King's Arms, Steelhouse Lane, who on entering the service of Her Majesty will
be taken care of, and invited to drink her health in a Flowing Bumper, and No
Mistake 1 **
Hospitable O'NAILL–invitation, most delightful . The bumpkin
drinks—feels, or hardly feels, the homicidal shilling slipped into his
hand, and he is enlisted—NAILLED ! From such ecstatic moment he
is at Her Majesty's service to cut, stab, burn and destroy, as though
all human will and human conscience were suddenly stricken dead
within him, and he was left no other than a machine of bone and
muscle – a marching, counter-marching, cutting, stabbing, pipe-
claying instrument 1 Great are the miracles worked by the
O’NAILLs 1
We once read a story of a huge ogre, who, playing upon a drum-
head wrought by the devil out of witches' skin, entered a town, and
drumming and drumming, led all the men away by their ears to his
bone-strewed cavern. And then and there he threw aside his music,
and gnashing his teeth and blaspheming the while, he took his
victims and ate them one by one, as a hedger would eat spring
onions. We forget the ogre's name, but we think it was something
like O'NAILL.
Oh, Birmingham youth—whoever you may be—look with stony
eyes upon the jovial, roystering courtesies of the Great Seducer
NAILL. Though you may be an Adonis—that is, a Brummagem
Adonis—do not believe yourself either “handsome” or “gay”—
but ugly, and irredeemably stupid : so ugly, that your plainness
would do no credit to a battle-field : so obtuse, that even the
awakening cane of the drill-sergeant would be lost upon you.
Again, you have not a roving mind—you do not wish to see the
world. Besides, a mind may not rove at “its own sweet will” accord-
ing to army regulations—and the world is a poor thing to see, with
musket in hand and rounds of ball cartridge at your back. Oh, youth,
stay at home, and see Birmingham.
And then the “laurels of the 55th foot l” What, in truth, are
laurels Dissect, analyse them. You may—with a touch of fancy
—trace in them the veins of withered hearts. Test them by true
moral chemistry, and what are they Blood and tears –tears and
blood | A homicidal wreath, gilded by the world's Great Lie And
so, Birmingham lad, cultivate coleworts, chickweed if you will, but
avoid laurels. They are a plant of death, manured by human hearts.
And next, the “flowing streamers”—the “true emblems of valour,
courage, and fidelity.”—Emblems, indeed, are they ; but view them
aright, young man between eighteen and twenty-five, and you will
see in them the flesh-tearing, torturing cat; in reality, the “nine
hard cords, about twenty-one inches long, each cord having nine
knots;” although appearing to your dazzled gaze—cheated as it
is by the Father of War—as so much fluttering riband.
In the United Service Magazine (No. 183), there is an article devoted
to the doings of the cat-the weapon with which Madame Glory
rebukes her naughty children :—
“Men have declared to me,” says an officer, “that the sensation experienced at each
lash, was as though the talons of a Hawk were tearing their flesh off their bones.”
Hear General SIR CHARLEs NAPIER on the cat—the real streamers
of the Recruiting Sergeant :—
“I have seen many hundreds of men flogged, and have always observed that when the
skin is thoroughly cut up or FLAYED off, the great pain subsides; and they bear
the remainder without a groan. They will often lie as without life, and the Drummers
appear to be flogging a lump of dead raw flesh. The faces of the spectators (soldiers)
assumed a look of disgust; there was a low whispering sound, scarcely audible, issuing
from the apparently stern and silent ranks;––a sound arising from lips that spoke not,
but that sound was produced by hearts that felt deeply. . . . The low sound sometimes
resembled what may he called sniffing, and may be occasioned by an increased flow of
tears into the nostrils.”
The heart sickens at this, and an unutterable feeling of disgust and
indignation must possess the reader. We might have paused ere
we committed the horror to our page, but that we utterly denounce
that easy humanity which shrinks from the contemplation of wrong
because of its hideousness. There are abominations—however
demoniacal—that must be placed before the startled eyes of a too
easy world, and this flogging—this blasphemy against the divine
nature of man—is of them.
Young men of Birmingham –nay, of all England—take these
things to your hearts, and consider well the streamers of a
SERGEANT O’NAILL. They look fine and gay; but they will tear
the flesh like “the talons of a hawk.” They are silky and soft; yes,
soft as the paw of a sleeping cat: but oh young men “from eighteen
to twenty-five,” be sure of it—the cat has claws Q.
YOUNG MANCHESTER.
Young ENGLANDIsM is spreading in all directions, and as these things
are generally pushed to the extreme, we should not be surprised at some-
thing still more infantine. Turning politics into child's play, is not
perhaps a new method of dealing with the subject, though it is the first
time that the juvenile in statesmanship has been openly contended for.
We understand that the Young Englanders intend to establish branches
in all the large towns, and Young Manchester will be one of the first off-
shoots from the parent society. Eventually there will be agencies every-
where; and an attempt is already being made to rally a few patriots round
Pummell, the beadle, under the banners of Young Kensington. He, how-
ever, is unwilling to tarnish the parochial gold lace, or sully the crimson
cape of power with the stains of sedition. Like CinciNNATUS, who rushed
from the service of the state to the hand-weeding of his own garden,
Pummell quits the pride, pomp, and circumstance of his staff for the humble
oyster-knife with which he opens out the prospect of profit to himself and
supper to his customers. However all this has little connection with
Young Manchester, which is the cut above these remarks, and a cut above
Young Kensington.

IMPORTANT RESOLUTIONS.
At a recent meeting of the waste-paper trade, it was moved by an
extensive rag-merchant, and seconded by a most influential butterman :-
That the thanks of this meeting are due to MR. GeoRGE Jones, the
author of Tecumseh, for having come forward with his tragedy at a period
when the waste-paper trade was languishing, but which, by the publication
of his play, has every prospect of speedily resuming its activity.
It was moved by the cook of the British and Foreign Institute, and
seconded by a large cheesemonger:-
That the côtelettes en papillote, or cutlets done up in curl-papers,
should, in compliment to the great work destined to be employed in
their preparation, be henceforth called JonesiAN chops, or côtelettes à la
Tecumseh.
It was moved by a marine store dealer, and seconded by a trunk-
maker :—
That the market price of waste-paper should not regulate the transac-
tions in Tecumseh, the extreme weight of which would place it beyond the
reach of the ordinary dealer at the customary rate per pound, and that
twelve pounds’ weight of Tecumseh should be paid for as one pound
weight of any other printed matter.

LONDON'S LIABILITIES.
The Aldermen of London have advertised their intention to redeem

the Lºrd Mayor, which the city will be glad to be redeemed from as
speedily as possible.
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH. —OF TITLE BY ALIENATION.
ALIENATION is the transfer of property from one to another, a process
in which the law delights; “For it is hard,” says Coke, “if the lawyers
do not get a chance of catching the oyster while it is being passed away
from one shell to the other.”
Traitors and felons cannot convey their lands; and if it is felony to
imitate the signature of A. Rowland AND SoN, it would seem that the
dealers in spurious Macassar cannot aliene their property. A felon may,
however, purchase anything he pleases, because ceo qu'il achetera la
couronne grabbera (that which he shall purchase the crown will grab, or,
lay its hands upon).
Infants and idiots may enter into agreements, which are not binding
unless confirmed when the infancy or idiocy has ceased; but it has been
said that a non compos cannot plead his own non-composity, because if he
could, the knave might often play the fool, and write himself down an ass
for the sake of getting rid of a bad bargain.
A married woman may purchase without her husband's consent; but,
after his death she may decline the bargain; so that MRs. ToMkINs might
buy a house, and having lived in it till the decease of ToMkINs, she might
then “cry off,” and insist on having her money back again. This is on the
principle of the boy, who, having heard an invitation “to taste 'em and try
'em, before you buy 'em,” ate half a hundred walnuts and expressed him-
self so dissatisfied with the fruit that he declined purchasing.
A married woman may join her husband in selling her property, but
she must undergo a tête-à-tête with a Judge or a Master in Chancery, who
are empowered to pump her, with a view to ascertaining whether she sells
of her own accord, or has been bamboozled or bullied into doing so. A
married woman who has property settled to her separate use, may play
at ducks-and-drakes with it if she pleases, and the law, instead of interfer-
ing, rather likes the fun of it.
An alien may purchase anything, but can hold nothing, except perhaps
his tongue; for it is useless on his part to say a word against the claim of
the sovereign, who may bone on the instant whatever may have been
bought by the alien. -
Having considered who may get rid of his property, we are next to
discuss how it may be done, and a thousand modes instantly suggest them-
selves. The law, however, reduces those modes to four—namely, by
deed, by record, by special custom, and by devise, which will form the
subject of the four remaining chapters.
SONNET TO THE TRUSTEES OF THE KENSINGTON ROADS.
YE sons of darkness, enemies of light,
Does conscience never haunt your troubled souls
See you no visions on a foggy night
Of omnibuses running with their poles
Into each other with an awful crash,
While panels scream with agony of smash;
And female passengers raise high the shout
Of “Stop, conductor, stop. Let me get out !”
Does not the rusting lamp-post, void of glass,
Like the tall skeleton of wild despair,
Point with its iron fingers as you pass
Into the vast infinity of air
While mutely eloquent it seems to say,
“Those stars must light the wanderer on his way.”
The Weather.
The wood pavement has suffered dreadfully from the late rains, having
been seized with an alarming swelling in all its joints. SIR PETER LAURue
has been called in, and has recommended, to keep down the swelling, an
immediate application of omnibuses. Should it come to the worst, the
city Solon has given directions to SIR CHARLEs CLARKE to send for the
Lord Mayor's state carriage, and, filling it with a strong solution of two-
thirds of the Common Council, and one-third of SIR PETER’s badinage, to
apply it instantly to the parts affected. Since this intelligence, the swelling
has burst with indignation.
Beparation in High Life.
It is our painful duty to record the secession of the Camera Obscura
from the King's Cross. It seems that on Saturday morning last it was
much affected by the fog, and, after taking one long lingering sight at the
faithful partner of its bosom, it left its constant Cross in a Parcels'
Delivery Company, and has not been seen in the neighbourhood since.
The report on the cab-stand is, that it has retired to Waterloo Bridge
for change of scenery. . If so, the future look-out of this wretched
Camera will be melancholy indeed.

BY OUR FAT CONTRIBUTOR.
[The relations, friends, and creditors of the singular and erratic being who, under the
title of the Fat Contributor (he is, by the way, the thinnest mortal that ever was seen),
wrote some letters in August last in this periodical, have been alarmed by the sudden
cessation of his correspondence; and the public, as we have reason to know from the
innumerable letters we have received, has participated in this anxiety.
Yesterday, by the Peninsular and Oriental Company's steam-ship Tagus, we received
a packet of letters in the strange handwriting of our eccentric friend; they are without
date, as might be expected from the author's usual irregularity, but the first three letters
appear to have been written at sea, between Southampton and Gibraltar, the last from
the latter-named place. The letters contain some novel descriptions of the countries
which our friend visited, some meat and ite moral - ts, and some ani -
descriptions of maritime life; we therefore hasten to lay them before the public.
He requests us to pay his laundress in Lincoln's Inn “a small forgotten account.”
As we have not the |. of that lady's acquaintance, and as no doubt she reads this
Miscellany (in company with every lady of the land), we beg her to apply at our Office,
where her claim, upon authentication, shall be settled].
* Aving been at Brussels for three
^ whole days (during which time, I
calculate, I ate no less than fifty-
y four dishes at that admirable table-
s' d'hôte at the Hôtel de Suède); time
began to hang heavily upon me.
Although I am fat, I am one of the
most active men in the Universe—
in fact, I roll like a ball—and pos-
sess a love of locomotion which
would do credit to the leanest of
travellers, GeoRGE Borrow, CAP-
TAIN CLAPPERton, or MUNgo
PARK. I therefore pursued a rapid
course to Paris, and thence to
Havre.
As Havre is the dullest place on earth, I quitted it the next day
by the Ariadne steamer—the weather was balm, real balm. A
myriad of twinkling stars glittered down on the deck which bore the
Fat Contributor to his native shores—the crescent moon shone in a
sky of the most elegant azure, and myriads of dimples decked the
smiling countenance of the peaceful main. I was so excited I would
not turn into bed, but paced the quarter-deck all night, singing
my favourite sea songs—all the pieces out of all the operas which I
had ever heard, and many more tunes which I invented on the spot,
but have forgotten long since.
I never passed a more delicious night. I lay down happily to rest,
folded in my cloak—the eternal stars above me, and beneath me a
horse-hair mattress, which the steward brought from below. When I
rose like a giant refreshed at morn, Wight was passed; the two
churches of Southampton lay on my right hand; we were close to
the pier.
“What is yonder steamer ?” I asked of the steward, pointing to a
handsome, slim, black craft that lay in the harbour, a flag of blue,
red, white, and yellow, on one mast; a blue peter (signal of depar-
ture) at another.
“That,” said the steward, “is the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation Company's ship, Lady Mary Wood. She leaves port
to-day for Gibraltar, touching on her way at Vigo, Oporto, Lisbon
and Cadiz.”
I quitted the Ariadne—JAson did the same in Lemprière's Dic-
tionary, and she consoled herself with drinking, it is said—I quitted
the ship, and went to the inn, with the most tremendous thoughts
heaving, panting, boiling, in my bosom
“Lisbon 1" I said, as I cut into a cold round of beef for breakfast,
(if I have been in foreign parts for a week, I always take cold beef
and ale for breakfast,) “Lisbon : " I exclaimed, “the fleuve der
Tage! the orange groves of Cintral the vast towers of Mafra Belem,
the Gallegos, and the Palace of Necessidades 1 Can I see all these
in a week? Have I courage enough to go and see them : " I took
another cut at the beef.
“What!” continued I, (my mouth full of muffin,) “is it possible that
I, sitting here as I am, may without the least trouble, and at a trifling
expense, transport myself to Cadiz, shining o'er the dark blue sea,
to the land of the Sombrero and the Seguidilla—of the puchera,
the muchacha, and the Abanico If I employ my time well, I may
see a bull-fight, an auto-da-fé, or at least a revolution. I may look at
the dark eyes of the Andalusian maid flashing under the dark meshes
of her veil; and listen to ALMAviv A's guitar, as it tinkles beneath
the balcony of Rosina – What time does the Mary Wood go,
waiter?” I cried.
The slave replied she went at half-past three.
“And does she make Gibraltar " I continued. “Say, John, will
she land me at Gibel el Altar opposite the coasts of Afric, whence
whilom swarmed the galleys of the Moor, and landed on the European
shores the dusky squadrons of the Moslemah Do you mean to say,
THoMAs, that if I took my passage in yon boat, a few days would
transport me to the scene renowned in British story—the fortress
seized by Rook, and guarded by ELLIot Shall I be able to see the
smoking ruins of Tangiers, which the savage bully of Gaul burned
down in braggadocio pride #"
“Would you like anything for dinner before you go 1" WILLIAM
here rather sulkily interrupted me, “I can't be a listening to you all
day—there’s the bell of 24 ringing like mad.”
My repast was by this time concluded—the last slice of boiled
beef made up my mind completely. I went forth to the busy town
—I sought a ready-made linen warehouse—and in the twinkling of an
eye I purchased all that was necessary for a two months' voyage.
From that moment I let my mustachios grow. At a quarter-past three,
oua FAt contRibutoR,
a mariner of a stout but weather-beaten appearance, with a
quantity of new carpet-bags and portmanteaus, containing twenty-
four new shirts (six terrifically striped), two dozen ditto stockings—
in brief, everything necessary for travel, tripped lightly up the
ladder of the Lady Mary Wood.
I made a bow as I have seen T. P. CookE do it on the stage.
“Avast there, my hearty,” I said, “can you tell me which is the
skipper of this here craft, and can a seaman get a stowage in her ?”
“I am the captain,” said the gentleman, rather surprised.
“Tip us your daddle then, my old sea-dog, and give us change for
this here Henry Hase.”
'Twas a bank note for 100l. and the number was 33760.
Royal Destitution.
We beg to call the attention of Her Majesty to the dreadful state of
her royal ancestor in Leicester-Square. His poor Majesty is nearly
smothered in grass; and though he and his horse probably lived all their
lives in clover, still it must have been of a far different quality to the
weeds which are actually forcing themselves into their mouths. We
have waited in vain for the scythe of Time to be applied to it, and we
sincerely hope Her Majesty will feel for the destitution of her nearly
invisible relation, and not allow him and his horse to be turned out to
grass (and such grass 1) during the severity of the approaching winter.
Perhaps the Poor Law Commissioners will, out of sympathy for the statue,
since it is made of stone, give it an order for the Middlesex Union 1
Irish Feathers.
LoRD CastleREAGH promises to be worthy of that father who has
given to the world A Voyage to Constantinople; for at a recent dinner to
the Londonderry tenantry, he said, “the proudest feather in Lond
Londonder Ry’s cap was not the laurels he had won in the field, but
the tenantry over whom he presided.” Truly, Mrs. Malaprop could
not have made a prettier jumble of feathers and laurels. . As for
Punch, whenever he thinks of LondonderBY's cap, he never dreams of
feathers, but of bells.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH,-OF ALIENATION BY DEED,
Aving to plunge into
the depths of
this subject, we
will first take
breath on the
margin to con-
sider what we
are about, and
having asked
ourselves the
question, what
is a deed we
shall proceed in
our own pecu-
liar way to an-
swer it.
A deed is said
by Coke to be
a writing sealed
and delivered by
the parties, but
a letter sealed
by the postman
and delivered by
himself is not a
deed — and we
defy Coke to
make it one. It
is called in Latin
Jactum, meaning something done, but we are of opinion that the word factum
in law proceedings should have a wider sense, and imply somebody done as
well as something. There is no doubt that Shakspere when he made
the witch in Macbeth exclaim “I’ll do, I'll do, I’ll do,” had some legal
craftsman in his eye, and the subsequent expression “a deed without a
name * proves that he intended an enormous doo and a deed to be syno-
nymous. An indenture is a deed cut at the top to resemble the teeth of
a saw, which is emblematical of sharp work according to some, but others
attribute it to the two parts of a deed having been cut from the same
parchment. A deed made by one party is called a deed poll from its
being polled or closely shaven, “and this " says Fleta, “is typical of the
client, who is generally pretty closely shaven.”
The requisites of a deed are:–1st, persons to contract and a thing to be
contracted for ; there must be something to give, somebody to give it, and
somebody to take, but if there were any difficulty about the latter, there is
the lawyer at hand who is ready to take anything.
2nd. There must be a consideration—but it is to be feared many deeds
are executed without any consideration at all—and there is a case in the
American books of a man without consideration having, on leaving his
chambers, hung his hat on the candle and put the extinguisher on his
head, a deed which if he had considered for a moment, he would not have
been a party to.
3rd. A deed must be on paper or parchment, for it has been decided to
be no deed if it be written on stone, board, linen, or leather. So that an
indenture cannot be made with the sole of a man's foot, though it has
been done on the sands at Ramsgate. Such an indenture is not however
binding, and it is liable to be quashed or squashed, when NEPTUNE enters
upon his usual roll, which he does about breakfast time. A deed is not
good on linen, but we have seen a cotton conveyance, when property, such
as a pound of cherries, has been passed from one boy to another in a
pocket-handkerchief.
4th. A deed must consist of the usual parts—the premises, which have
nothing to do with any premises in the bricks-and-mortar meaning of the
word, but simply include the names of the parties and other preliminary
matter-the habendum and tenendum or having and holding, which the
law being of a grabbing disposition is extremely jealous of. The red-
dendum, which means the rent and is something to be rendered to the
granter, from an immense yearly sum downwards to a peppercorn. The
condition, which provides for forfeiture in case of the rent not being
forthcoming. The covenants or clauses of agreement some of which run
with the land, which has nothing to do with the case of a tenant running
with the goods; and the conclusion which mentions the execution and date
of the document—though a wrong date does not signify, and a deed
dated the 30th of February, showing it had been executed in no time,
has been held valid provided there is proof of its having been actually
delivered.
Reading is requisite to a deed, but as hearing it read generally has the
effect of confusing the parties and preventing them from knowing what
they are about, the ceremony of reading is seldom insisted on. A deed
must be signed and sealed, but a deficiency of penmanship and sealing-wax
may be: got over by a cross and a wafer, which are sufficient for legal
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
purposes. Delivery is also an essential to a deed, but it is not a delivery
in the sense of the London Parcels Company that is here alluded to.
Every deed must be witnessed, which is the greatest safeguard the
subject enjoys; for it is horrible to contemplate what deeds the law
might do if not controlled by the presence of witnesses.
We must now explain the several species of deeds, a subject well worthy
the poetic muse, which has been successfully wooed by Mr. John CRISP,
who in the Conveyancer's Guide" has shed a halo of imaginative light
over the sombre darkness of Feoffment and its dreary fellows.
1st. Comes feoffment, which is derived from infeudare, to give a feud,
and a feud meaning a row, it must be inferred that a feoffment, being the
conveyance of a fee, is a thing that it is worth one's while to quarrel and
fight about. 2nd. We come to gifts; but gifts very seldom come to us,
for they are almost obsolete; and gift being conveyance number two, we
are not surprised that regard to number one has almost superseded it.
In the 3rd place are grants, which speak for themselves, and we therefore
plunge at once into the 4th mode of conveyance, which is a lease, a style
of deed that every one must be familiar with. Exchange and partition,
which are the fifth and sixth kinds of conveyance, are also self-evident in
their meaning, and we are therefore surprised at their forming a part of
our fine old inexplicable legal system. -
Releases, confirmations, surrenders, and assignments, afford various
opportunities for getting rid of property; but the technicalities attendant
on describing them would be too abstruse for the comprehension of the
purely elementary student whom these learned pages are designed to edify:
Suffice it to say, that a release has nothing to do with a rescue, though it
prevents property from being locked up by showing you how to get rid
of it. The other modes may easily be learned by those who have any
estate of which they are desirous of being legally disencumbered.
A Covenant to stand seised is an agreement to hold property, for the
use of another, which must be rather a tantalising position. It is some-
times called an innocent conveyance, and perhaps a man may be said to
enter into a covenant to stand seised, if he gets into a row and allows the
policeman to walk him off quietly to the station house.
These are the principal modes of conveyance, by which property may
be carried off, at a rate surprising to those who have heard only of the
law's delays, though the law, when anything valuable is to be disposed of,
displays remarkable quickness.

TO AN USHER FOR A BOARDING SCHOOL,
ſº.º.
CºTON Azoº
A&AD E My . º
==tº is * % ->
|
I FEEL. glad with myself to believe
=> that I am enabled to place you in a com-
fortable home. My friend, MR. Jacob Awl,
"º-ºw
of Crichton House, has at this moment a
vacancy for an usher." I have taken it upon myself—and I trust that
this confidence on my part will not be abused by any bad conduct
on yours—to recommend you. MR. Awl, like myself, has a great
respect for learning; and—as I have assured him of your proficiency
in Greek and mathematics—he has come to the determination of
offering you twenty pounds a-year, without your washing. There are
altogether about three months’ holidays in the twelvemonth, which
time, let it be understood, you are expected to board and lodge
yourself. As, however, non semiper tendit arcum Apollo (you remem-
ber the adage, MR. MAPLE), you will be enabled in the summer
vacation to relax those energies which, as an honest man, you will
be called upon to string to the utmost at Crichton House. There is
Brighton, or Worthing, or Ramsgate, open to you. So much for
pleasure.
As to business; you will remember twenty pounds per annum is
the sum—a remarkably handsome stipend for any young man, who,
having decorated his mind, is consequently careless of the finery of
dress. Nothing so befits the true scholar as a well-worn coat : it is
to my mind the only proper badge of the man of real learning.
Hence, you will be expected to dress cleanly, decently; but with not
the least approach to foppery. My friend MR. Awl is very particular
on this point. He parted with one usher, only because he would insist
upon wearing straps to his trousers.
MR. Awl has upwards of seventy boys, and he will place sufficient
confidence in you—that is, upon my recommendation—to hand them
over to your keeping. Hence, you will be expected to see them all
safe in bed; to have an eye upon them whilst dressing and washing;
to take your meals with them ; to never leave the school-room; and,
above all, when the young gentlemen recreate themselves in the play-
ground, or take a walk, or go to church, you are to accompany them,
giving your most vigilant attention, your every thought to their
doings, and indeed at all times and in every respect studying the
interest of your employer as if 'twere doubly your own. For you
will remember that the salary is twenty pounds per annum ! There
are positively many footmen who do not get so much.
But the money, to a man of enlarged and truly scholastic mind, is
as nothing. It is, if you rightly consider it, the dignity of the calling
that makes it really valuable. You are to remember that you are, in
fact, making future citizens; that you are, if I may so express myself,
creating a part of the future mind of the country, and ought there-
fore to look upon salary as the mere inevitable dross—the something
that the dealings of the world make necessary—but as altogether
dust in comparison with the golden satisfaction that, whatever in old
age may be your fate, you may probably have taught the youthful
mind those noble lessons which have obtained for it station, wealth,
and honours.
It is a great satisfaction to me that I am able to place you so hap-
pily as at Crichton House. I have every belief that you will not
disgrace my recommendation, and am,
Your well-wisher,
MAT THEw WILKINs.
P.S.—Whatever they may be, let me advise you not to depreciate
the suet-dumplings.
LETTER XLV.
THE ANSWER.
SIR,
THANK you for your kind intentions. Happily, I am other-
wise provided for. Having served five years as usher, I am fully
able to appreciate the blissful liberty I now enjoy. Sir, I remember
where I have been, and so remembering, think myself at this pre-
sent time in Paradise.
It may be true enough that a threadbare coat is the proper livery
of the scholastic drudge of a school; but alas ! sir, I had not suffi-
cient philosophy to bear rags and darnings with complacency; and
moreover to endure the wit of the young gentlemen—levelled as it
often was—at the poverty of their teacher. For five miserable win-
ters, trying to look very genteel for the respectability of your esta-
blishment, did I shiver in one thin coat. A comforter—there was a
mockery, I always thought, in the word—about my neck, vainly
essayed the service of a surtout. And now, sir, I am warmly, cosily
clothed, and can put on a bluff countenance at the elements.
Judge you, sir, of the happiness of my present state. It is true, I
am sometimes up early and late; but then, sir, I am abroad in the
world. I am looking upon life in its every aspect. I am not nailed
to a desk eight hours a day, with little dunderhead boys droning
their lessons in my ears till they sing again. I may now and then
have my little disputes with folks; but I am not doomed to the prac-
tical tricks of a set of young rascals, who think it a prime piece of
mischief to quiz a “beggarly usher.” I may have to send certain
folks home to their beds, but I have not to rouse them up in the
morning, and be answerable for their washed faces and combed hair
at breakfast.
Beneath your roof, I had I remember one hour a day—yes, one
whole hour, as you would say, to myself: the hour before bed-time :
now, sir, I have hour upon hour in which I can reflect upon life and
death; in which I can again and again call to my memory the glory
of the poets, which glory I make a sort of armour to my soul, that
with invincible serenity it may bear the buffets of the world about
me. I am now in the country; and at solitary midnight, I can con-
jure up old HoxtER, and AEscHYLUs, and SoPHocles, and Thucy-
DIDEs, and so make them walk and talk with me, and thus enjoy
immortal company. Now and then, it is true, some squalid thing—
some harsh noise—will for a time scare them away; but, with little
effort, I can manage to bring them back again, and make them
familiar to me as before.
Happy liberty Above all things, I am not expected to look after
half a hundred boys while they play. I am not accountable for every
rent in their nether corduroys—for every button violated from their
jackets—for the black eye that Jon Es gave to Robinson, returned
with a sanguinary nasus by BRow N. True it is, that I am still a sort
of overlooker of juveniles—but let them quiz me if they dare.
No, sir! it is in vain that you seek to tempt me back to Academic
groves. I am too much enchanted with my present liberty to—but,
sir, when you know what I am, you will at once acknowledge the
superiority, the abounding comforts of my place, compared to that of
usher at a boarding-school.
Know, then, sir, that for the last three months, I have enjoyed
the appointment of full private in the New Police. Have I not said
enough Could you, would you, after this have the heart to lure me
to Crichton House and questionable suet-dumplings?
Yours, with thanks,
MARTIN MAPLE.
ASSURANCE DOUBLY SURE.
OUR last accounts from Ireland assure us that MR. O'Connell will be
a Federalist again, or something worse, next Monday. We feel convinced
of this, as he was a Repealer every day last week.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FºxPENSES OF PUNCH.
A HAMBURGH newspaper lately gave an account, partly true and partly
erroneous, of the enormous expenses of the Times. The German peri-
odical, Der Swingin Norwidgin, has been busy in calculating the expenses
of Punch. The calculation is almost as full of blunders as though the
Statistical Section of the British Association had had a hand in it. Never-
theless, there is a good sprinkling of truth, sufficient at all events to
warrant our inserting it.
“The British periodical, The Punch, has fifteen hundred first-rate
writers constantly employed upon it. They are paid at an enormous rate,
and are kept in stalls or cages near the printing-office in the day-time;
but at night they are driven out into the suburbs. Each of the principal
contributors has forty pounds a week (2000l. a year), and as much ink as
he can consume, gratis. The chief artists are on the same footing. There
is an enormous corps of small jokers, at salaries averaging about three
hundred a year each; but they are obliged to act as a sort of joke police,
constantly on the look-out to take up any facetious subject they may meet
with, and bring it to be dealt with by one; or other of the principal
contributors.
“The merely mechanical part of the arrangements is also exceedingly
costly. There are several hundred compositors, who relieve one another
constantly, as they successively boil over with indignation or are convulsed
with laughter at the manuscript they are putting into type. There are
several boys at the engine ready to prevent the chases, in which the type
is placed, from splitting their sides, which they have been known to do
with the pressure of an unusually rich caricature or article. But the
hardest work of all is performed by the Publisher, who sometimes sinks
down in a state of exhaustion, and is always wrapped up in blankets, and
carried away from the office, after the exertion of having taken the money
on the day of publishing.”
THE ADVANCE OF BEADLEDOM.
It is not without a feeling of fine old constitutional alarm, that we con-
template the slow but certain, the insidious but unmistakeable growth
of Metropolitan Beadledom. We do not allude to that pure race of patri-
archs, who have worn, the parochial purple with becoming mildness
towards the great, mingled with unspeakable dignity towards the small;
but we do allude to that alarming hydra which seems starting up with a
bit of gold lace on its interminable array of heads in every quarter of the
Metropolis. The Quadrant, which formerly owned the paternal sway of
a private watchman, is now—a Beadledom, and we are threatened with
having the peaceful flag-stones of Trafalgar Square trodden down by the
iron-heeled highlows of a staffed and hatbanded functionary belonging to
this most dangerous of despotisms. If we turn our eyes eastward, and
peep through the new arcade in Catherine Street, what do we see 1 Does
not everything, bespeak the probability that a pretext for indulging the
spirit of beadleization will be found in this locality also We know that
we may be told the British Beadle is not formidable. We may be per-
haps informed that there are moments of alarm when even the burly and
bludgeoned Beadle of the Burlington Arcade may be knocked down with
a feather. But we will reply, it is not what the Beadles now are, but
what the system is progressing to. As lovers of the Constitution, as
friends of the people, ay, as protectors of those wretched and infatuated
instruments of despotism, the Beadles themselves, we deem it our duty to
keep our eye on the great and growing grievance.
THE ROYAL ALBUM.
When QUEEN Victon IA visited Louis-PHILIPPE, he had an
Album prepared in honour of Her Majesty's sojourn at Eu, the inci-
dents of which formed the subject of the pictorial and literary matter.
As it is probable that the QUEEN will wish to pay a similar compli-
ment to her friend and ally, by making his visit the subject of an
Album, we have taken the liberty of furnishing a few hints for it.
Some pictorial illustrations will be found on another page, and the
following are quite at the service of our beloved QUEEN, as scraps
for the proposed Album.
LINES ADDRESSED To Louis-PHILIPPE BY QUEEN VICTORIA, ON HIS
ARRIVING AT WINDSOR CASTLE.
So you have ventured here, in spite
Of all that little Thiers could write
Come, take my hand, with honest clutch,
Nor fear “perfidious” Albion's touch.
'Twas only perfidy, of course,
That made them cheer till they were hoarse,
I mean the folks who hours did wait,
To greet you at the entrance gate.
Perfidious, are they Well, my friend,
I wish you only could depend
Upon your safety 'cross the brine,
As I can safely trust to mine.
EPIGRAM BY PRINCE Albent.
They ask, vy do you come
Avay from your French home,
A visit—d'oder day,
To QUEEN and me to pay :
You owe us dat, 'tis true,
Because we vent to Eu (you).
As it will be desirable to have as much as possible in the Album
from the pens of the Royal Family themselves, we should suggest that
the heir-apparent's little hand should be guided while he signs his
little name in a little bit of French :
Edouard ALBERT, LE PRINCE DEs BALEINEs.
(The Prince of Wales.)
THE WORKHOUSE AND THE GAOL.
WHAT a wicked set are the poor Under the frivolous pretence of
hunger, like animals ignorant of the rights of property, they rush into
bakers' shops, and, without one penny in their pockets, seize and devour a
twist worth twice the amount . Therefore, of course, they are sent to
gaol. But this is their very object. Instead of meekly kissing the rod of
SIR JAMES GRAHAM, and submitting, with resignation, to the just reward
of their poverty, they craftily manage to exchange the workhouse for the
milder horrors of the prison. With this unprincipled view, they actually
go and break windows. The daily police reports prove the fact. Now
destitution must be punished. The law, backed by a Bishop, has said so;
still, respectable people must not have their windows broken. The good
man's twopenny twist must be protected. We see but one course to
pursue. Justice must be sometimes sacrificed to expediency; and infi-
nitely lower on the scale of morality as the pauper must be allowed to be
than the convict; still theft must be put down. This can only be done
by increased severity, and, accordingly, we recommend that the prisons
and unions should respectively change their inmates; the Poor being at
once sent to GAol, and the FELoNs consigned to the Workhouse. The
alteration may bear rather hard upon the thief; but that cannot be
helped.
Two Epigrams.
“America claims me and my honours.”—Wäe George Jones on the doubtful question
of George Jones's origin.
You say America your honours claims—
Speak, Jones I on what more worthless could it fix *
If with success you carry on your games,
You never win by honours but by tricks.
HARK to Columbia's question of despair,
“Where are his honours?” Echo answers, “Where?”

blow, she having lost four of her front teeth by the violence of the Thursday night. They had had a few words; in fact, the prisoner was a

Police Constable Lynx deposed that he was, on Monday night, on his advance of him. The complainant meeting the woman addressed her in
beat in Coventry Street, when he heard the screams of a woman. He a very rude and unseemly way, at the same time throwing his arms round
ran, and discovered the complainant, lying on the pavement, and the her. Whereupon the prisoner, rushing forward, struck the complainant,
It appeared that the prisoner and his wife were proceeding home on
accused at the bar shouting and hallooing, and swearing he was a gentle-
man, and no mistake. Whereupon, after much difficulty, the Constable
took the prisoner into custody.
GRAce MITTENs (the complainant) deposed that she was employed in a
dress-maker's establishment. She had been kept late at work on Monday
night, and was returning home, when the person at the bar accosted her,
placing his arm round her waist. She told him to go about his business,
when, with his clenched fist, he struck her so violently on the mouth, that
he dislodged four of her front teeth.
MR. HoNEY.combe asked the prisoner what he had to say for himself.
The prisoner said he had been out dining.
MR. Honeycombe observed that that could be no excuse for such un-
manly atrocity. It was a most shameful and cowardly assault upon a
defenceless, virtuous girl, and he certainly would fine the prisoner in the
sum of five pounds, or—two months' imprisonment.
The fine was IMMEDIATELY PAID, and the gentleman drove from the
office in his cab.
and knocked him into the road.
CHARLorte BRiggs deposed to the above facts. She had been very
grossly assaulted by the complainant before he was struck by her husband.
MR. Honeycombe said he had no doubt that an assault had been com-
mitted ; a very gross assault: nevertheless, people must not take the law
in their own hands: there would be an end to all things, if people took
the law in their own hands. He wished to know what the prisoner had
to say for himself?
The prisoner said that, seeing his wife assaulted, he could not help doing
what he had done; he was not sure that he should not do the like again
under the like circumstances.
MR. HoNEY.combe observed, that he had no doubt that the complainant
had very grossly misconducted himself; nevertheless, the prisoner had
committed an assault, and the sentence was that he must pay a fine of 21.,
or undergo six weeks' imprisonment.
The prisoner had not a farthing, and was—REMoved IN THE PRIson van.
THE MOON AT THE FULL ||
(By ExPREss.)
Moon has dined with Louis-Philippe at St. Cloud l l l
He behaved very decently at the dinner, considering everything. The
King (bless him, he is a good-natured man after all), introduced Moon to
the party as “the Promoter of the Fine Arts.” Moon has got the new
title engraved on his cards. Thus–

To
his MAJESTY Louis-Philippe.
Not content with the dinner at St. Cloud, Moon asked himself to the
palace the following Saturday. Louis-Philippe good-naturedly said,
“Certainly,” when Moon intimated his intention of dropping in, in a
“come, phil, give Us A lig:It l”
friendly way, for a cigar. Of course he took his subscription-book to
the Palace, and pressed all manner of signatures, from the Duc D'AUMALE
to Monsieur Piporte, the concièrge. Moon wears the grand cross of
the Legion of Honour at his button-hole, and has been twice mistaken for
the English Ambassador. He often refers to the mistake with pleasure.
There is only one fear to be entertained—that his mind may give way, like
the lady's in the ballad—
* With the burden of an honour,
Unto which he was not born.”
THE LAW OF DEODAND.
A cuRIous question arose the other day in the Bail Court, as to what
could or could not be the subject of a deodand. An enlightened puisne
and a sagacious junior got chatting over the subject very cosily, putting all
sorts of absurd cases, in which the judge and the junior kept trumping
each other's wild suppositions and funny associations with considerable
cleverness. We give a specimen of the sort of game they were playing
at :—
Judge. It might have been a bit of the boiler.
Junior. Then the deodand should have been on the bit of the boiler.
Judge. And on some particular bit of course—but which bit {
Junior. The bit that struck him. If a man is killed by a cannon-ball,
the deodand must be on the cannon ball.
Judge. But how could the Coroner sit upon it?
Junior. Or he might have been scalded by the water.
Judge. Then the deodand must be upon the water
Junior. Truly.
Judge. How if he was frightened to death by the noise Where would
you put the deodand
Junior. On the noise, of course.
Judge. I think that would be a sound decision.
After all this we find the two words RULE GRANTED, but what rule, or
why, or what about, we defy anybody to collect from the sort of conversa-
tion they—the puisne and the junior—had previously been indulging in.

LAST might a very numerous and respectable (if a
little noisy) meeting of Wine Bottles was held at
Exeter Hall, for the purpose of petitioning the Par-
liament for an Act to make all Wine Bottles hold a
certain quantity, and thereby to put an end to much
duplicity and public disaffection created by the present
order of things.
MR. MAGNUM (a bottle of very respectable appear-
ance and dimensions) was called to the chair, and
briefly opened the proceedings; he said, he hoped that
all assembled would remember where they were, and
behave themselves accordingly.
MR. BEEswing moved the first resolution. He said
things had come to such a state, that the name of
Wine-Bottle was now synonymous with cheat and
swindler. Let the meeting look at him. He was
called a Quart Bottle ; again and again had he been
sold as such, and how often had he heard himself
upbraided and sworn at for not running more than
nine glasses 1 (Cries of shame.) Their ancestors-
the great bottles that had gone before them—were
incapable of this. (Hear, hear.) Every one of 'em
held twelve glasses, that was, a fair wine-quart—then,
indeed, it was merry England.: but with wine-bottles
of uncertain measure—with none of 'em giving as
much as seventeen to the old respectable dozen—it
was no wonder that we had the income-tax
MR. THIN TAwNY seconded the resolution. He looked
upon a Bottle as the fountain of truth. (Hear, hear.)
If, then, the bottle was a cheat, a hypocrite ; yes—he
would say it—a humbug, what was to be expected of
Q fault if he were only a pint and a quarter, instead of a
| fair quart. (The speaker, who from his ercitement
seemed as if he had been drinking himself, sat down
º after seconding the resolution.)
N MR. Full FRUITY moved the next resolution. The
M E E T IN G.
B O T T L E S.
mankind in general He himself was a humbug.
(Hear.) But could he help it ! No ; he had been
made what he was by the falsehood, by the unholy
thirst of gain in the world about him. It was not his
whole wine-bottle question required full and imme-
diate reform. He cared not from what side it came
(hear); for he was not for men, but measures. (Loud
laughter.) It was once held a great thing to be called
a four-bottle man. Why, as bottles were made now,
a spinster might carry four of 'em, and be never the
worse—no, all the better for it.
MR. PALE seconded the resolution. If members
of Parliament would honestly attend to the Bottle
Question, they would do more honour to themselves,
and greater service to their country. It was only
a few days ago that Mr. Justice PATTEsos declared
that he could not understand half the Acts passed
by Parliament; and why?—doubtless, because mem-
bers shamefully neglected the Bottle. It was not so
in the good old times of Fox and Sheridan. (Hear.)
He looked upon the question as vital to the preserva-
tion of society, and he called upon every Bottle pre-
sent never to desist from its efforts, until it was made
a quart—a whole quart—and nothing but a quart.
The resolutions were all passed; and the meeting—
the police having gathered strong—quietly separated.
REBELLIOUS JERSEY."
Now ING that England is in danger of being
dragged into a war of conquest by the
impertinence of the shabby little island
of Jersey, where the Supreme Court is
treating the authority of British law
with supreme contempt, endeavouring
to cheat the Great Charter, and playing
all sorts of tricks with the Habeas Corpus
Act, we boldly say the disaffection of
Jersey must be promptly put down, and
we strongly recommend a summary
smash being applied to the officials of
that dismal islet. Somebody proposed
the other day to send a small party of
grenadiers into the place to frighten the
turbulent Jerseyites into submission,
but we don't wish to see any spilling of powder or loss of lead, (we
calculate, of course, that a few harmless discharges over their heads
would soon bring them to their senses,) and we should prefer despatching
Inspector MALLALIEU at the head of a few of the valiant letter E's, who
have already distinguished themselves by the capture of sundry fruit.
baskets and the routing of numerous apple-women.
Jersey, however, must be quelled; for, paltry as the place is, it must
not pull off its allegiance as if it were an old pinafore. We shall have
Sark next talking about its independence of the British crown ; and the
Legs of Man may begin kicking against Her Majesty's authority.
We should as soon have expected our old friends, neighbours, and
fellow-subjects of the Eel-pies to have commenced talking about declaring
their independence, or the Isle of Dogs to have insisted on sending
ambassadors to the court of St. James's.
SIR FREDERick Thesiger has been giving indirect encouragement to
the rebels, by talking about Jersey being governed by a Grand Coſtumier
before or since (it don't matter which) the Norman Conquest. If there
is any fellow going about Jersey, calling himself the Grand Coûturnier,
and denying the authority of British law, there can be only one opinion
as to his proper place being a London station-house. He ought to be at
once bound over to keep the peace between England and Jersey.
Old Bailey Justice.
It appears that SIR JAMEs GRAHAM, recommending the discontinuing
the evening sittings of the Central Criminal Courts, the experiment is
about to be tried. We are, however, told that “on account of the short-
ness of the notice, it will not be possible to discontinue the evening
sittings on the days appointed for the next session.” Nevertheless, on the
recommendation of Punch, the judges and aldermen will, during and after
dinner, restrict themselves to cold water. ".

Punch. (hysterically.)—“Bless you BILL! you shall never want a friend, or a good word, as long
as I live.”
To that spirit of courtesy which is always shown to Punch at Windsor Castle,
Buckingham Palace, and every other Royal residence, does he owe a copy—an
exclusive copy—of QUEEN Victoria's letter to Louis-Philippe, touching
SHAKEspeAR in France. MR. MACREADY had the honour of receiving the
epistle from Her Majesty's own hand, and ere our sheet can be printed, will
have delivered it to the King of the French.
Windsor Castle, Nov. 27th, 1844.
MY DEAR BROTHER of FRANCE,
Health and greeting ! The bearer of this is MACREApy. You doubtless
remember on your late visit to our Court, that, among other things, I expressed my
regret at the absence of MacREADy—he was then on his way from America—by which
you were denied what I conceive to be one of the highest of all intellectual enjoyments,
namely, SHAKESPEAR finely acted. However, MACREADY is now with you, and I know
you will cherish him.
I assure you, my dear brother of France, that, in consenting to your wish that
ShakespeAR should be played in Paris by some of my best English actors, I have
made a sacrifice to my friendship. You read the English papers, and must know how
dearly I love a play; how, might after night, I visited Drury Lane when managed by
MacREADy; how, indeed, in twenty different ways, I showed my admiration of the
drama, believing it, as I truly do, worthy of the best encouragement of an enlightened
monarch. All I envy Elizabeth is her SHARESPEAR. What a subject to have glorified
a sceptre What a jewel in a crown However, as I can’t have SHAKEspeaR himself
at Court, I am continually listening to some of his plays, and continually thinking how
best may be honoured the divine art of which he is the Divinest Magician. You will
recollect, very shortly after Bulwer wrote a play, I made him a baronet. I have
wanted to do something of the sort for MACREADY, but PEEL–he is such a strange,
cold person—declares that it would not “be correct.” Aldermen, and so forth, may
be dignified, but not mere men of genius. PEEL declares that the world can get on
very well without genius; and, really, one has only to listen to him for a short time to
believe it.
In France, however, these things are differently thought of. Hence, if you choose
to give the Legion of Honour to MacREADy—nay, if you like to make him a French
peer, you may. I shall be only too well pleased by any distinction you may confer upon
him. Let me also recommend Miss FAUCIT-a great favourite of mine—to the good
graces of the Queen and the Princesses.
Write me over what you think of my actors; and, above all, when they have gone
their round of plays, let them not linger in Paris; but cause them to return imme-
diately to London—for I assure you I don't well know how I shall get over the time
without them. To be sure the Opera will be opening ; but, compared to SHAKESPEAR,
what is the Opera !
Your affectionate Sister of England,
Victoria, R.
PHILADELPHIAN REVELS.
ANOTHER journal has been informed, by its American cor-
respondent, that the 200th anniversary of the birth-day of
WILLIAM PENN, and the 160th of his landing on the shores of
the New World, was celebrated at Philadelphia on the 25th
ult. with appropria e exercises. Our own, has told us what
these appropriate exercises were:–
One very appropriate exercise was the exercise of the
Thimble-Rig by a company of the chief Merchants and
Bankers, wherein was displayed great adroitness.
Another was the exciting and national sport of “Beggar my
Neighbour.”
A great many exercised themselves at a species of Back-
gammon, played between a Philadelphian and an European,
in which the latter was invariably gammoned.
The abilities of sundry were likewise exercised in round
games of Commerce and Speculation; the chief fun, as is
usual in those amusements, consisting in the cheating.
“Forfeits” were also largely played by men in drab and
aliens, the latter forfeiting whatever they intrusted to the
former.
The populace, in the meanwhile, loudly exercised their
lungs, bawling continually—“Non-Payment l” “Repudiation
for Ever!” “No Surrender l’” One Quaker, amid much
applause, propounded the following sentiment: “Phila-
delphia ; herself independent, can never be depended on.”
|FASHIONS FOR PUBLIC STATUES.
IN head dresses we have
seen nothing new, the pre-
vailing mode partaking of
the cocked hat and the pig-
tail. Sheets and table-
cloths are much in favour
as wrappers, and an anchor
hanging out of the coat-
pocket, a la NELSoN, gives
a novel finish off to a naval
uniform.
The
WINDSOR WARNINGS.
We should like to know
who is the Editor of the
boards stuck up in Windsor
Park, to warn people off
the grass, for there is a de-
cided roughness in the style,
which would be the better
for a little polishing. On
entering the Park from the
Castle, there is a board on
the left, intimating that
“Gentlemen are required,
and servants are desired,
to keep upon the gravel,
and not to break out upon
the turf.” The difference
of the tone adopted to-
wards “gentlemen’’ and
“servants” is very re-
markable. To the former
it is evidently intended to
say, literally, “be good enough to keep to the gravel ; ” while
to the latter it is clearly designed to convey such a sentence as
“Hollo l you fellow, come off the turf, or I'll pretty soon
make you.” What is meant by “breaking out” upon the
turf we do not exactly comprehend. Does it mean that horses
are not to be “broken in " on the spot that is prohibited
the Duke's statue, As seen
FROM The Poultry.
ANOTHER AND ANOTHER STILL SUCCEEDS.
ANOTHER revolution has been discovered at Madrid within
the last week. We wonder the papers have taken the trouble
to mention this, since it is only one.

Who can fail to be struck with the alterations in the fashions since the
days of chivalry . Then, steel turned up with leather was the prevailing
material, and a delicate trimming of spikes gave a finish and fulness to
the shoulder. Gloves, instead of being formed of the flimsy kid, were
regularly Birmingham manufacture; and a grasp of the hand from a
friendly knight was not a thing to joke about. The falchion has been
superseded by the cane ; the crested saucepan for the head by the velvet-
napped gossamer.
We can fancy a tailor's window in the olden time, with its FRoissant-
like “stock,” and good old English labels. We think we see a placard
thus inscribed—“Lookke hearre . . Yese fynne coattes of maille ſytte for
ye stouteste knyghte, onlie 4 and 6.” Yes, imagination paints to our heated
vision a lot of greaves, with a ticket announcing, “Fyve thousandde
paires” of them. But this is all over now, and the highlow has trodden
down the knightly what-do-ye-call-it.
SITTINGS IN THE COURT OF REVIEW.
The Trial of “Old Heads and Young Hearts,” for Wilful Obscurity.
Mr. Punch for the Prosecution.
Q. What are you, sir?
A. A dramatic author.
Q. Do you remember the night of Monday, the 18th of November 1
A. I should think I did.
Q. State to the Court what occurred that night.
A. A new comedy, called “Old Heads and Young Hearts,” was pro-
ced on that night at the Haymarket Theatre.
Q. Who was the author of that comedy ?
A. Am I obliged to criminate myself?
Q. Is that your name 1 (Producing a play-bill.)
A. It is.
Q. You are there stated to be the author.
A. I confess it.
Q. Now, sir, on your oath, had you any distinct notion of a plot in
writing that comedy?
A. I think so; but I am not quite sure.
Q. Could you describe to the Court the plot of that comedy ?
A. (looking very confused.) Describe the plot
Q. Yes, sir.
A. I would rather not attempt it.
Q. In the comedy, Lord Charles Roebuck runs away with one lady,
and MR. LITTLEton Coke with another. Now, sir, which gentleman runs
away with which lady ?
A. Lord Charles runs away with LADY HAwthor N–no, with MR.
Littleton Coke—no, no, Coke runs away with LADY Alice, and Miss
Rocket runs away—no, Lady Alice runs away—no ; really, sir, I can't
exactly say
du
charged
A. Why, sir, he tells the EARL of Pompion that Lady Hawthors is
in love with Lord C11 Å RLEs Roebuck; and then M.R. LITTLEToN Coke,
who is in love with Miss Rocket—no, with LADY Alice—is very angry ;
and somehow the Earl thinks that Lord Cilamles is somebody else, and—
really, sir, I can't say—
Q. I thought as much. Now, sir, tell the Court why MR. LITTLETox
Coke quarrels with his brother.
A. It was necessary for the piece, sir.
Q. You had no other reason 4
A. No.
Q. Can you explain how the EARL of Pompion is deceived about the
election ?
A. (after a pause.) I cannot.
Q. In the first scene, you state that MR. Coke's fortune left him by
his father was 700l. per annum; in the last scene it is stated as 2000l.
per annum. How do you account for this
A. Why, I relied upon the interest that should have been produced
during the four acts.
Q. What is the object of making Bob assume the character of an
electioneering agent
A. It was necessary to create some fun for MR. Buckstone, who played
the part.
Q. Had you no other reason?
A. I had not.
Q. You may stand down.
“THE DEADLY URN.”
MR. PUNCH,
In your review of MR. GeoRGE Jones's book, you quote an ex-
tract from that gentleman's speech at Stratford, in which he details all
the horrors of starvation at sea: in which he talks of “the deadly urn,”
wherein his shrivelled hand was placed to draw his lot—of a beloved sister,
“famine's victim,” &c.
you ask, with an incredulous sneer not to be misunderstood, for the name
of the ship, of the captain, and of the owners. After some trouble I have
discovered what you seek, and to shame you in your scepticism, send it
you. Know then, sir, that the name of the ship was the Houncer, the
name of the captain FLAM, and the owners were no others than Mux-
CHAUSEN AND Company.
Your obedient servant,
NAUTicus.
P.S. However you may sneer at Mr. Jones's story, I assure you it is
one of those narrations that are often recommended to be told to the
marines.

HEAve away, my tight niggers, my jolly brisk blacks,—

You'll be smarter, I guess, for correction.

Of Oppression and Wrong and all that,
Where's the true Yankee nigger who'd wish to be free,
Or would make a wry face at the Cat

Don’t it flog universal creation ?
Ain't you wallop’d, you dogs for the good of the State—
The enlighten’d American nation

With “Yoho l'at the top of your pipes;
Stick like wax to your colours, the stripes and the stars,
And give thanks to your stars for your stripes.

3%loom's Court Cittular.
N Monday MR. ALDERMAN Moon visited Wer-
sailles, and chose the particular spot
where his portrait should hang. It is
between David and LE GR0s, and a
little above NApoleoN.
On Tuesday the PRomorER gave an
audience to MR. HoRAcE VERNET, who
wished to consult him about his por-
trait. It was decided that MR. Moon
should be taken in the right side of the
face, as it gives the artist a better
opportunity of painting MR. Moon's
favourite cheek.
On Wednesday MR. Moon received
M. JANET, the celebrated engraver, to
listen to a proposition for engraving
his portrait. In the evening MR.
Moon went to the theatre at St. Cloud, attended by Louis-Philippe.
On Thursday MR. Moon received an address from the artists of France,
with a vote of thanks for his disinterested patronage of the fine arts—
caricature in particular. The deputation was headed by MEssRs. PHILIP-
Pon, GAvARNI, and DAUMIER. -
On Friday MR. Moon attended a Cabinet Council. All the Ministers
were present. M. BIARD was in attendance behind a curtain, to take a
sketch of this historical event, which His MAJESTY intends presenting as a
picture to MR. Moon.
On Saturday the PRomorER was busy all the day in getting subscriptions
for an engraving of the above picture, which he intends dedicating to
Louis-Philippe. The CoMTE DE PARIs and the young Princes waited on
MR. Moon, to take their leave of him. PRINCE Joinville was in tears.
After dinner, the QUEEN sang a duet with MR. Moon, and the Duchesse de
NEMoURs heard him his French lesson in “Au clair de la Lune.” About
seven, MADAME ADELAIDE helped MR. Moon on with his great-coat, and
a citadine being called to the door, the PRoxſoter left the palace, with his
gºs, charged with autograph letters to all the poor artists in
rance.
TWO WORDS TO M. DE LAMARTINE.
SIR,
You are what is rare in France—a Poet—and, what (we fear) is still
rarer, a Christian | When you speak, Young France takes his hat off,
though you do believe in something older than the Revolution. Your
words have weight even here in England; and Punch began to read your
letter to M. Thiers with highly-wrought expectations. He laid it down
with a long-drawn “Phe-e—ew !” You deliver M. Thiers a lecture on
the absurdity of exciting his peppery countrymen about a petty question
of religious differences, and kindling the torch of war with the dis-
patches of M. BRUAT D'AUBIGNY, for a miserable rock in Oceania.
Significantly, you add, “there are richer fields of glory to be reaped
on the banks of the Rhine, and the shores of the Mediterranean.”
You remind me of the old thief, who when his son exhibited with
pride his maiden trophy, a brass tobacco-box, extracted, without de-
tection, from the parental small-clothes, boxed the boy's ears. “Not,
my son,” he added, “because you have picked my pocket—but be-
cause you have not picked it of something more valuable.” Did you
ever hear the story of the gourmand, who, at table was seen stealthily,
but bitterly weeping; “They are the first tears I ever shed 1" he re-
plied, on being asked the reason; “I weep to see that man” (and he
pointed to a hungry poor relation, who was walking into a joint at the
foot of the table), “throwing away that blessed appetite upon a leg of
mutton!’"
So, M. DE LAMARTINE, you weep to think that M. THIERs, and Young
France with him, should be throwing away their appetite for glory on the
“leg of mutton” of Tahiti, when the “pdté de foie gras” of the Rhine,
and the “macaroni au jus” of the Mediterranean, lie temptingly, crying,
“Come eat me.”
Somehow, I didn't expect to hear the author of the “Méditations
Poétiques et Religieuses” measuring the sin of an injustice by the amount
of the product. Puzzled, I took down that volume of your works, and
these lines met my eye:—
“Chrétiens, souvenons-nous que le Chrétien suprême
N'a légué qu'un seul mot pour prix d'un long blasphème
A cette arche vivante oil dorment ses legons;
Et que l'homme, outrageant ce que notre âme adore,
Dans notre coeur brisé ne doit trouver encore
Que ce seul mot: Aimons !”
Think on the import of these lines, M. DE LAMARTINE, and cancel, if you
can, your letter to M. Thiers.

MILITARY MIIPS SING.
Several meritorious officers having complained of the expense of the
wine drunk at the mess, Field-Marshal the Duke of WELLINGroN, the
Commander-in-Chief, hereby sends forth the following regulations:—
That it shall be permitted to every officer who cannot afford port or
sherry, to try Masdeu or Marsala ; but it must be distinctly understood,
that any officer drinking these inferior wines, be expected to leave the
table directly his allowance is exhausted. His Grace also desires that
some intimation should be given when the allowance has been drunk out,
and his Grace suggests a wink, or a kick of the shins under the table, as
being, perhaps, the more delicate, because the less generally perceptible.
His Grace desires that in poor regiments, where, in consequence of
the expense, the quantity of wine is limited, the officers should make out
with beer.
His Grace desires that if any officer is unable to stand the cost of wine,
he shall be protected by his superior officer in the economical expedient
of having at his side a decanter of toast-and-water; and any one insulting
the said officer on that account, or in any way throwing the toast-and-
water in his face, should be severely reprimanded.
His Grace also desires a general revision of mess expenses, so as to
bring them to something like conformity to the expense of getting into a
mess before a magistrate, which is usually about five shillings.
PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER XLVI.
FROM A PEASANT, FoR AN ALLOTMENT OF LAND
TO A LANDOWNER.
Honoured SIR,
HoPING that you will be pleased to
pardon the boldness of a poor man who wants
# to keep his wife and children, I take up my
º ºf pen to write. And, honoured sir, I hope you
*J will forgive me, if I say that I feel alittle happy
that I am able to put a few words to paper,
—it being a sort of comfort to a man, howsoever poor he may be.
My boldness, honoured sir, is this. It is, under your favour and
consideration, to ask of your kindness, to let me have an acre of
| land : or if I am too bold in asking a whole acre, half or a quarter of
the same. I know that it may be thought a little high and daring in
me, to ask for such a favour, seeing that your estates are let out in
large farms. It is, perhaps, a presumption, and—as I’ve been told—
a sort of flying in the face of property, for a man who isn't rich
enough to farm a thousand acres; who has n't money for cattle and
bone-dust, and all that, to think of having a little slice of land, just
to grow a few things on for himself and children, land only being
for them who can have a lot of it, or none. Nevertheless, sir, I
hope for your kindness. I've been all along used to go to church,
though I hope I may be forgiven for it, I haven't been these two
months, seeing that my clothes are all in such rags that, as one of
the churchwardens told me, they were quite a disgrace to a respect-
able congregation. Well, sir, I say I used to go to church, but I
never heard there whether the Garden of Eden was twenty thousand
acres or not—perhaps the gentlemen who set their faces against
small allotments, know it to have been a very large farm indeed, and
so think they have religion upon their side, when they refuse a poor
man a little patch for his own spade. I know that it was made a
part of the punishment of sin—a part of the curse of heaven—that

man should eat his bread in the sweat of his face. That, however
wicked he may have been, he should not on his own account be suf-
fered to eat his bread at all, does seem to me—and my heart is so
full, I can’t help saying it—very like a curse coming from the other
place. I suppose, too, they who eat their bread from the sweat of
other people, have never sinned at all. I hope, honoured sir, you
will forgive these words; but my pen runs away with me like.
When I ask, honoured sir, for this bit of land, I mean, of course,
to pay the very highest price you can get for it. I know that land
let out in little bits is always made to fetch more than when let by
the lump. This, of course, the poor must expect. It is so in all
things. My wife gives more for her bit of soap and candle (when
she can buy it), more for my bit of 'bacco, than if we could buy
such things by the pound, like respectable people. And it isn't then
to be expected that a great landlord, even though he may be a
Duke to boot, will do otherwise than the keeper of a chandler's-
shop. No, sir, though my neighbours say I'm a bold fellow, and have
strange nonsense running in my head, I don't expect that.
If people wern’t so foolish as to think otherwise, there would never
have been such a noise about a gentleman who said, “If he let a lug
of land for fivepence when he could get eightpence for it, he should
be giving away threepence to the tenant.” The gentleman only said
what was true : the gentleman only said what nearly all the world
do with one another every day of their lives. I was reading in a
London newspaper that was lent me a day or two ago, where all
sorts of things were advertised to be sold one under the other;
coats, and waistcoats, and trousers for almost no money at all. Well,
the people who buy 'em say it's no business of theirs how the things
are made ; that's not their concern,-all they want, as a duty to
themselves and families, is to get a cheap penn'orth ; as it were to
wrap themselves comfortably up in a bargain and then go with their
prayer-books to church to show it. If we could ever think that the
time would come when folks wouldn't bargain with folks, as though
because they'd money to buy, they’d eat their fellow-creatures up—
if it isn't, indeed, bold in me to say fellow-creatures—if we could ever
hope for such a time, why, sir, then this world would be indeed much
nearer heaven than, perhaps, poor men have any right to expect.
And yet, sir, church has puzzled me now and then. When the parson
has told us that we are all made of earth, I have, I own it, now and
then looked into a fine pew or two, and—if it’s a sin, I hope I may
be pardoned for it—and I have sometimes doubted it. To be sure,
soil is so different; the better sort of folks may be the rich and
loamy; and the poor, the cold stiff clay, only fit for draining.
Still, sir, folks say that things are brightening up for the poor.
There are a good many signs of it. Only last autumn, I’m told,
three real lords played at cricket somewhere with some shopkeepers.
A man in our village—who's reckoned to know something—has
said it isn't unlikely that in less than twenty years a squire may
now and then join in quoits or foot-ball with day-labourers. If ever
this should come to pass, it must lead to good things. For of course
the matter won't stop there. The squire, after making so familiar,
will look in at the men's houses ; will talk with their wives and
little ones about their food, and their clothes, and such like—giving
them a kind word and a helping hand when they want it. This, of
course, will come of the matter; otherwise, for my part, I can’t see
such very great good in it. Politeness is a nice thing, and sometimes
warms a poor man's heart more than he can tell it : but politeness
itself won't put a 'tato on the plate when there isn't one. Folks can't
eat quoits and foot-balls.
And now, sir, I hope you will be so good as to let me have this bit
of land. It will, I feel, make quite a man of me. Yes, sir, I mean
that word and no other. As it is, sir—I don't know how it can be—
but somehow at times I don't feel a man at all. I seem as if I’d no
business in the world; as if I was a sort of toad or slug upon the
soil; an interloper on the land, having no right even to make a foot-
mark in it. The sun doesn't seem to shine for me—nor the wheat
to shoot—nor the hedge-flowers to blow. I feel sometimes as if
poverty in this world was made the mark of CAIN, and was upon
me ; with this hard difference, too, that any man might smite me
for it.
And then, sir, the temptations that fly and run about one ! I mean
the game, sir. Many a time, when I’ve heard the pheasant crow,
it has somehow sounded—though not a bit like it—like one of my
children crying for food, and then for a minute my brain has been in
a blaze, and I’d have done anything. When things are at the worst,
and starvation is for days in my cupboard, the devil—or something
like him—has sent the hares running about me, as though on purpose
to be knocked down with a stick. It's a hard matter, sir, to keep
one's hands off a dinner running at one's feet—a dinner that it's hard
to think belongs to anybody in particular.
And therefore, honoured sir, I do hope for a bit of land. If it’s no
bigger, one may say, than a lark's turf, like the lark I know I can
whistle upon it and be happy. And so, honoured sir, asking your
pardon for my boldness, as a poor man, in thinking of such a thing,
I remain,
Yours humbly to command,
ABEL WEED.
LETTER XLVII.
THE LANDLORD'S ANSWER.
ABEL WEED,
HAD you known anything of the true principles of poli-
tical economy, you would never have written such a letter to me, a
landowner. Know, that it is much better for you that you should
not have even a quarter of an acre—that it is for the social good of
all that you should remain as you are.
THEoPHILUs CANAAN, Bart.
THE HOUNSLOW MAIL.
We of course feel much satisfaction at anything like cordiality among
the servants of the public ; but we think private friendship ought not to
be allowed to interfere with the discharge of the duties belonging to any
department of the Government. We have observed for some time past
a growing intimacy, which seems ripening into esteem, between the two
drivers of the Hounslow Mail Carts; and the result is, that when they
meet at Kensington Gore, one going out of London and the other coming
in, a chat takes place between them. This interchange of civilities began
with a mere nod; it then budded into a pull up of both horses in the
middle of the road, and it has at length blossomed into a long chat of some
minutes' duration. This is a very delightful sight to the mere philo-
sopher; but to the citizen and man of business it suggests a delay of
letters, which may cause much inconvenience to the Londoners, as well
as the Hounslowites.
We should be sorry to check the gushes of cordiality, the “How are
you, my heartys 1" and other gratulatory expressions that mutually
burst from the lips of the two mail drivers; but we think they should
arrange their meetings to take place after the delivery of the letters, and
then private friendship would not clash with the public interest.
Harmless Enthusiasm.
The Globe tells us that some ladies at Fonthill, Wilts, have been at
work for two years on pieces of cushion lace which they intend as a
present to the Queen. Our “own correspondent” from Fonthill gives us
the further gratifying intelligence, that the over-hours of the same enlight-
ened and benevolent women have been given to the making of gowns
and petticoats for the necessitous in the neighbourhood. This is, indeed,
to combine the elegant with the useful.
DE MINIMIs. CURAT Lex.
How true it is, that the law of England protects the humblest as well as
the highest species of property, throwing over the poor man's turnip and
the rich man's pine-apple an equal shield ! Nothing is so insignificant or
comparatively valueless, that it cannot be rendered safe in the hands of
its owner; and we know of no stronger illustration of this than the fact,
that at the bottom of the title-page of GeoRGE Jones's Tecumseh appear
the words, “CopyRIGHT secuRED !!!”

AFTER-DINNER SESSIONS.

show the expediency of discontinuing

you mean the prisoner.
Officer of the Court. Well, it’s all the same. What does the prisoner
say, Guilty or Not guilty?
Prisoner. Not guilty. ".
1st Counsel. Gentlemen of the jury, it is my painful duty to appear
for the prosecutor—
Prisoner. That’s the gentleman who was paid to defend me.

am for the prosecution, ha, ha, ha!

is impossible I can sit here to be interrupted by counsel.
2nd Counsel. Call the first witness, what's his name
Usher (calls). “What's-his-name !” (A general laugh, in which the
bench, bar, and jury join.)
Judge. I must commit, if this sort of conduct is repeated. Prisoner
at the bar, what have you to say to the charge
1st Counsel. My friend has not made out any case; I submit there is
nothing to go to a jury.
Judge. Gentlemen of the jury, you have heard such of the facts of
this distressing case as are capable of being conveyed to your know-
ledge. Gentlemen, the criminal law of this country draws a happy
distinction between assumed guilt, and guilt actually proved. In
Hawkins's “Pleas of the Crown” you will find all this laid down
much better than I can explain it to you. Gentlemen, I shall not
detain you with any further observations, but I leave the case in
your hands, with this simple observation, that if you have any doubt
you must give the benefit of that doubt to the prisoner.
The jury (laughing among themselves). Of course we must let him off.
We’ve heard nothing against him.
Foreman of the jury. We find the prisoner, Not guilty.

If we see you here again, you will certainly be transported. You
belong to a bad lot. I’m quite convinced of that. Hollo 1 where's

fellows are rather too quick for us.

pupillari, who shall be seen at any hour of the day in any of the courts of
this college, whether it be the Great Court, Neville's Court, the New
Court, or the Fourth Court, without his academical dress; whether he be
seen or not seen by any porter, tutor, or master of the college, shall be
fined the sum of two shillings and sixpence, which shall go to the benefit
of sound learning and religion, by being applied to the college library.
3mu fligredbrr, Let notice be taken, that any cap of which more than
three of the four corners be broken, or otherwise dilapidated, or if more
than two corners together with the tassel shall be wanting, it shall not be
considered as academical, and shall be liable to the said fine of two
shillings and sixpence.
ØIgg, If any gown be worn, of which more than half the skirt together
with one sleeve be torn off, or if the skirt be whole and the two sleeves
be gone, or the gown itself be in ribands, then shall it not be considered
as academical ; and any person, in statu pupillari, wearing such a cap

gown over his night-shirt, or at any rate lying on the bed, or without his
cap on, over or under his night-cap, as the case may be, contrary to the
good order and discipline of the University, he shall for the first offence
be fined the sum of two shillings and sixpence; and if he persist, for the
second time he shall be fined the sum of five shillings; for the third seven
shillings and sixpence, and so on. But if he persist obstinately, he shall
then be brought before the master and senior, and shall suffer such
punishment as they shall think fit to inflict.

Now, Mr. Punch, I ask you, if it is not a hard case, that after the first
of April next I shall be obliged to purchase a new cap, or be fined two
shillings and sixpence? I consider this a breach of our privileges as
undergraduates—we, who are accustomed to pride ourselves on the
badness of our caps. Shall all our honest pride be overturned—the pride
of all the rows we have been engaged in—of all the lamps we have
smashed—all the heads we have broken—is this to be taken from us by
? But I find I am getting personal, and hoping you will make our
case known, I am proud to be
THE Own ER of A BAD CAP.
Alarming Failure.
THE eclipse of the moon on Sunday week last was, as the Post would
say, a “fiasco.” In London it was regularly hissed at an early part of
the evening. In Liverpool, where it shone to a little better advantage, it
was slightly applauded, but in no instance was it called before the curtain
after the performance, though this might have been partly owing to a
strong cabal formed against it by the fog. One thing is certain, that the
eclipse must have been a failure, or else why was it withdrawn the following
evening, and has not been announced for repetition again this year?
DO OBLIGE US FOR ONCE,
PARLIAMENT is announced to open on the 4th of February. Really, it

WI DI) ICOMB. THE FOX-HUNTER.
ºvº- -
lºsº-
WE have seen WIDDIcomb under almost every phase. We have watched him
charging the Lambeth cohorts on the deal platforms of Waterloo. We have
seen him leading on the Stangate Russians, and urging them to feats of pa-
triotism over the planks of Moscow. We have observed him dictating terms to
Astleian India from the back of BATTY's elephant. We have marked him
marshalling the Mamelukes in the avenue leading from the stable, prior to his
bursting out into the circle in all the pride of white stockings, tights, a green
baize coat fringed with door-leather, and highlows converted into hessians by
the tops of a pair of Wellingtons. But never until the present season have we
seen him as Widdicome, the English Fox-hunter, the British sportsman chasing
the real fox through the O. P. Wing, and round the sawdust circle. The air
with which he salutes the hounds, the urbanity with which he winks at the pro-
perty man to let the fox out of the canvas bag, the bonhommie with which he
capers, about among the gentlemen riders at the Meet, must be seen to be de-
scribed; and having been described, must still be witnessed.
HUSBANDRY OF THE DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH.
The Aylesbury News continues to give new accounts of the benevolence of the
Duke of MARLBoRough, who is fast making for himself an enduring reputation
in the hearts of the poor at Waddesdon. It appears that the Noble Duke at
Lady-day last let out some allotments of stiff land at 48s. per acre, for spade
husbandry. The land was very unproductive; it was doubtful whether it could
be made to yield even a single sprig of laurel for his Grace. However, tenants
took the land at Lady-day last, and at Michaelmas the over-punctual Duke
sent his steward for twelve months' rent ; that is, his Grace required of
the spade-labourer six months' rent in advance t Dull people have thought
such demand a little unusual. Why, so it is; but then, as the Duke of
MARLBoRough —he is notorious for it—pays always in advance for what he has
himself, he merely wishes that his tenants should conform to his own practice.
Besides, allotment tenants have always a superfluity of money; and the worthy
Duke, by demanding his rent before it is due, does so upon the benevolent
principle that none of the cash shall go to public-house or beer-shop. Excellent
nobleman Great-hearted landlord A few more such landowners, and what a
Garden of Eden would England be

PETER THE GREAT ON WEIGHTS 1
It was thought an irreparable loss to the world of fun
when the immortal Gai MALDI ceased to sing Hot Codlinst
Nevertheless, the world has been somewhat solaced for a plea-
sure gone, by the frequent self-exhibitions of SIR PETER
Launie. May he live until the miniver on his gown grows
grey as time !
SiR PETER has lately expended his wisdom on weights. A
cheesemonger of Silver-street was charged for trading with
illegal weights in his shop
“Sir P. LAURIE directed the weights to be produced, which were earthenware
ones, plugged with lead at the bottom. Sir Peter observed that they were no
weights at all; they were not allowed by law, and THERErose they could not be
called illegal weights.”
Now, short weight is not allowed by law; and so, according
to Sin PETER, short weight is not illegal weight. And this is
the logical brain that decides upon the imprisonment of men
and women—this, the intellect that is to put down suicide 1
But, to proceed with ALDERMAN Gaixi.ALDI:—
“Sir P. LAURIE. These new-fashioned earthenware weights are not weights
at all. They are dreadfully cheating weights, and my mind is almost good
enough to break them myself at this very moment.”
“Almost good enough 1” Why, SIR PETER, were weights
made of stones, your mind would be quite good enough to
break them : quite; and not a bit too good.
“A gentleman in the Court observed that Alper MAN Copeland had recom-
mºnº. tradesmen in the City to use porcelain weights, or better known as
ALPERMAN Copeland's weights.
“Sin Pster LAURIs... I know nothing of Alder MAN Corelaxp's weights;
he mºy have an eye to business. I have not, and am therefore better able to
decide on their merits. They are grossly illegal—no doubt of it, but not illegal
enough. The defendant is discharged; his weights will be broken up.”
Why should the man's weights be broken up, if the man is
discharged Why, says SIR PETER, the weights are grossly
illegal, but not illegal enough. In the like way, we presume
that a candidate for an Alderman's gown may be grossly
asinine, but not asinine “enough.”
THE WOODEN WALLS OF ENGLAND.
A Newspaper paragraph informs us that “if an acorn be left for
some weeks suspended by a string over the surface of some water
contained in a hyacinth-glass, it will throw down long roots, whilst
its stem will rise upwards, and become decorated with leaves.”
This is cheering to know, as the British navy need never be in
want of timber as long as there is a hyacinth-glass and a bit of
twine left in the kingdom. The idea of growing oaks in a second-
pair-back is so rich to us, that we intend to-morrow to plant
four-and-twenty acorns on all our mantel-pieces, and have no
doubt that in less than a year we shall have a perfect Windsor
Forest in every room in the house. Let us hope that the Oaks
will not be of such a nature as eventually to take us in.

FRIENDLY WARNING TO REBELLIOUS JERSEY.

A PPL E S — A N D T H E I R S I N S.
or H apples and men have their good qualities;
and apples, like men, are denounced as of ques-
tionable reputation, if found in bad company.
Beautiful is the fruit piled in the centre walk
of Covent Garden market; tempting the fair-
est and the richest daughters of Eve to touch,
and then to make it their own. Very beauti-
ful, too, are apples with their golden skins and
rosy cheeks beaming through the plate-glass
window of the West-end fruiterer. They
are a wholesome luxury; by no means for-
bidden fruit to either dealer or purchaser.
They have blossomed and ripened for wor-
shipful society, and are pleasant to the eye,
delicious to the taste of the delicate, the com-
fortable feeder. Yes; strange as it may
seem to the sons of ADAM, there is an Aris-
tocracy of Apples 1
Who shall deny it ! Here is a basket of
plebeian pippins; it may be, poor, crude wind-
falls. It is not their fate to be ticketed in
Covent Garden at eight a shilling. They are
not to be gently handled by the kidded palm
of lady huswives, afterwards to play their part
in a dessert, and be ceremoniously cut in
pieces with a silver blade. No : they are
doomed to a wicker basket, to be exposed in
the common highway for sale by creatures,
who having scarcely a roof to cover them, do,
nevertheless, assume to themselves the part
of fruit-sellers, to the manifest scandal of the
law, and the virtuous disgust of the shop-
keeper.
Several criminals of this sort have lately
been cited before MR. TRAILL, of Union Hall,
and their delinquencies proved by solemn tes-
timony of policeman 178 P, who, it is doubtless
a satisfaction to learn, “has been very active in looking after
offenders of the above description.” They had absolutely sold fruit
in the Walworth-road. The iniquity was so glaring—was perpetrated
in such noon-day light—that human patience, nay the very meekest
and most tolerant Christian charity, could not wink at it; and thus
we are told, in the police report, “ some of the shopkeepers had
written to the station-house complaining of the nuisance 1"
It is of course a nuisance to the sympathies of shopkeepers that
people who have not the respectability of a shop, and the comforts
of a back parlour, should, tempting the wrathful visitation of a wintry
sky, stand with their shops about their necks, to waylay school-boys
for the halfpence that, by every respectable rule of trade, ought to be
paid over a counter. It is the misery, the pauperism of the traders,
that makes the offence. Could they now and then sit themselves
down in an arm-chair before a sea-coal fire—only to be thence
disturbed by the advent of a customer, there would be no nuisance
whatever in the traffic. But that the audacious vendors should in
biting, frosty days, stand roofless upon the stones until their flesh is
almost bloodless as the granite they tread upon, it is this that stirs
the sensibilities of shopkeepers: it is this that makes them write,
with pens of flame, complaining missives to the station-house !
Many of these shopkeepers are, doubtless, admirable people :
pattern husbands and wives, fathers and mothers. They make their
very trading only subservient to their domestic affections—their
household duties. And they are to be disturbed, ruffled past
Christian patience, by people not at all respectable ! To be sure, it
might by special pleading be urged, that the offenders too have
husbands and children, albeit—miserable wretches l—they have no
shops. They stand wretchedly clad in the cold, dreary street, to
earn uncertain bread for mouths at what they call a home. Never-
theless, they are a nuisance — poor people always are—and the
abomination should be put down. And how ; Great hope 1 we see
a way.
Let vigilant Policeman 178 P do his duty sternly as fate. Let the
magistrate fine every offender—he can do so—forty shillings, or
commit to gaol; and in a short time the law-breakers must inevi-
tably be hunted to the Union. This step will, of course, add no
trifle to the poor's-rate of Walworth; but then, respectable shop-
keepers will bear the extra burden resignedly, gaily, for a great
“nuisance” will be abated. They, the shopkeepers, husbands
and wives, will not be separated; they may hug their children still ;
and, like good Christians, teach their little ones the Lord's Prayer
night and morning.
Still, the Walworth apple-sellers are not the worst of the wicked.
However annoying and unlawful their vocation, they do not put a
very brazen face upon the matter. No ; they have a sort of latent
respect for the shopkeeper, for on Ma:TRAILL asking, if they walked
on the footpath “so as to prevent passengers from going along about
their business,” it was admitted by Policeman I78 P that “the
defendants stationed themselves at the edge or curb of the footpath "
There is, it must be confessed, a seeming modesty in this; though
there is a sort of respectability that walks about the world with his
arms so very much a-kimbo, that patient, striving poverty, at the
very “edge” of his footpath, is an obstruction, a nuisance; a thing to
be thrust into its kindred mud. What, indeed, to such respectability
would be the possession of the Garden of the Hesperides, so long as
paupers vended shrivelled apples at the “edge "
However, there is no doubt that the audacious spirit of the times
has manifested itself in even the doings of street fruit-sellers.
They no longer know their place, but by all sorts of blandishments
tempt unwary children to lay out their holiday halfpence. It was
only last summer that these offenders absolutely sold slices of melons
and pine-apples | The exclusive luxuries of the rich and respectable
were positively vulgarized, being bartered in the common street for
copper penny-pieces. Melons and pine-apples made familiar as
gooseberries to the palates of the mob I Alas, and alas ! for the
institutions of the country 1
We really hope that the authorities will act with vigour in this
apple question. Let them be assured of it, there is more in the
matter than meets the eye. The apples may, indeed, look rosy and
wholesome, but—unless strong measures be adopted—they may, like
the Dead Sea apples, be nought but cinders to the public mouth.
Walworth respectability already knows as much, and spits at them.
Q.
SONG OF THE CHEAP CUSTOMER.
HURRAH for cheap clothing ! I want not to know
How the work or material was got ;
If the article's good, and the figure is low,
For the wherefore I care not a jot.
Make me out to encourage oppression and vice,
On my beggarly meanness enlarge ;-
Ha! I get a whole suit at one half of the price
A respectable tailor would charge.
Hurrah for the Saxony coat superfine,
Which I buy for about two pounds ten 1
If Theft furnished the cloth, 'tis no business of mine,
If Starvation the stitching, what then
Hurrah for the trousers of best kerseymere,
And the gay satin vest at thirteen
To employ any tradesman, although he is dear,
All because he is honest,-how green 1
And hurrah for the shirt for whose purchase I pay
From a couple of shillings to three,
Wrought by famishing Need at a farthing a day;
What on earth can that matter to me?
All I want is to dress at the smallest expense,
In as stylish a way as I can,
Like a practical, straightforward, plain, common sense,
Economical, provident man.
That to clothe me the skinflint and swindler combine,
Is a fact I don't ponder about,
And that thousands in hunger and wretchedness pine,
I regard their employers' look-out.
To procure all my goods at the lowest of shops
Is the course that I mean to pursue ;
Then hurrah for low tailors and sellers of slops 1
Be they Heathen, or Christian, or Jew I

BY OUR FAT CONTRIBUTOR.
II.--THE SHIP AT SEA.—DOLORES l
He first thing that a narrow-
:= minded individual does on ship-
board is to make his own berth
comfortable at the expense of
his neighbours. The next is to
criticise the passengers round
about him.
Do you remark, when Britons
meet, with what a scowl they
salute each other, as much as to
say, “Bless your eyes, what the
angel do you do here " Young
travellers, that is to say, adopt
this fascinating mode of intro-
duction—I am old in voyaging
—I go up with a bland smile to
one and every passenger. I
originate some clever observation about the fineness of the weather
—if there are ladies, I manage to make some side appeal to them,
which is sure of a tender appreciation: above all, if there are old
ladies, fat ladies, very dropsical, very sea-sick, or ugly ladies, I pay
them some delicate attention—I go up and insinuate a pillow under
their poor feet. In the intervals of sickness I whisper, “a leetle hot
sherry and water 1* All these little kindnesses act upon their deli-
cate hearts, and I know that they say to themselves, “How exceed-
ingly polite and well-bred that stout young man is.”
“It’s a pity he’s so fat,” says one.
“Yes, but then he's so active,” ejaculates another.
And thus you, mydearand ingenuous youth who read this, and whom
I recommend to lay to heart every single word of it—I am adored by
all my fellow passengers. When they go ashore they feel a pang at
parting with their amiable companion. I am only surprised that I
have not been voted several pieces of plate upon these occasions—
º dear youth, if you follow my example you may be more
ucky.
Acting upon this benevolent plan, I shall not begin satirically to
describe the social passengers that tread with me the deck of the
Lady Mary Wood. I shall not, like that haughty and supercilious
wretch with the yellow whiskers, yonder, cut short the gentle efforts
at good fellowship which human beings around me may make—
or grumble at the dinner, or the head-wind, or the narrowness of the
berths, or the jarring of the engines—but shall make light of all these
-nay, by ingenuity, turn them to a facetious and moral purpose.
Here, for instance, is a picture of the ship, taken under circumstances
of great difficulty—over the engine-room—the funnel snorting, the
ship's sides throbbing, as if in a fit of ague.
... There ! I flatter myself that is a master-piece of perspective. If
the Royal Academy would exhibit, or MR. Moon would publish a
large five guinea plate of the “main-deck of a steamer,” how the
public would admire and purchase With a little imagination, you
may fancy yourself on shipboard. Before you is the iron grating,
up to which you see peeping every minute the pumping head of the
engine ; on the right is the galley, where the cook prepares the
victuals that we eat or not, as weather permits, near which stands a
living likeness of MR. Jones, the third engineer; to the left and run-
ning along the side of the paddle-boxes are all sorts of mysterious
little houses painted green, from which mates, mops, cabin-boys,
black-engineers, and oily cook's-assistants emerge; above is the
deck between the two paddle-boxes, on which the captain walks in his
white trousers and telescope (you may catch a glimpse of the former),
and from which in bad weather he, speaking-trumpet in hand, rides
the whirlwind and directs the storm. Those are the buckets in case
of fire; see how they are dancing about 1 because they have nothing
else to do—I trust they will always remain idle. A ship on fire is a
conveyance by which I have no mind to travel.
Farther away, by the quarter-deck ladder, you see accurate
portraits of Messrs. Mac WHIRTER and Mac Mundo, of Oporto
and St. Mary's, wine-merchants; and far, far away, on the quarter-
deck, close by the dark helmsman, with the binnacle shining
before his steadfast eyes, and the English flag streaming behind him
(it is a confounded head-wind)—you see—O my wildly beating,
my too susceptible heart l—you see DOLORES :
I write her name with a sort of despair. I think it is four hours
ago since I wrote that word on the paper. They were at dinner, but
(for a particular reason,) I cared not to eat, and sat at my desk apart.
The dinner went away, either down the throats of the eager passen-
gers, or to the black caboose whence it came—dessert passed—the
sun set–tea came—the moon rose—she is now high in heaven, and
the steward is laying the supper things, and all this while I have
been thinking of Dolores, Dolones, Dolones
She is a little far off in the picture; but by the aid of a microscope,
my dear sir, you may see every lineament of her delicious counte-
nance—every fold of the drapery which adorns her fair form, and
falls down to the loveliest foot in the world ! Did you ever see any-
thing like that ankle —those thin, open-worked stockings make my
heart thump in an indescribable rapture. I would drink her health
out of that shoe; but I swear it would not hold more than a liqueur
glass of wine. Before she left us—ah me ! that I should have to
write the words left us—I tried to make her likeness; but the abomi-
nable brute of a steam-engine shook so, that—would you believe it –
this is all I could make of the loveliest face in the world ! .
Dolores-A Sketch taken in Rough Weathera.
I look even at that with a melancholy pleasure. It is not very like
her, certainly; but it was drawn from her—it is not the rose, but it
has been near it. Her complexion is a sort of gold colour—her eyes
of a melting, deep, unfathomably deep, brown—and as for her hair,
the varnish of my best boots for evening parties is nothing compared
to it for blackness and polish.
She used to sit on the quarter-deck of sunny"afternoons, and
smoke paper cigars—oh if you could have seen how sweetly she
smiled and how prettily she puffed out the smoke I I have got a bit
of one of them which has been at her sweet lips. Ishall get a gold box
to keep it in some day when I am in cash. There she sat smoking,
and the young rogues of the ship used to come crowding round her.
Mac Whi RTER was sorry she didn't stop at Oporto, Mac Mundo
was glad because she was going to Cadiz—I warrant he was—my
heart was burst asunder with a twang and a snap, and she carried
away half of it in the Malta boat, which bore her away from me for
ever.
Dolores was not like your common mincing English girls—she
had always a repartee and a joke upon her red lips which made
every one around her laugh—some of these jokes I would repeat
were it not a breach of confidence; and had they not been uttered in
the Spanish language, of which I don't understand a word. So I
used to sit quite silent and look at her full in the face for hours and
hours, and offer her my homage that way.
You should have seen how Dolores ate too ! Our table was

served four times a-day—at breakfast, with such delicacies as beef-
steaks, bubble and squeak, fried ham and eggs, hashed goose, twice-
laid, &c., of all which trifles little Dolon Es would have her share—
the same at dinner when she was well: and—when beneath the
influence of angry Neptune the poor soul was stretched in the berth
of sickness, the stewards would nevertheless bear away plates upon
plates of victuals to the dear suffering girl; and it would be “Irish
stew for a lady, if you please, sir?”—“rabbit and onions for the ladies'
cabin”—“Duck, if you please, and plenty of stuffing, for the Spanish
lady.” And such is our blind partiality when the heart is concerned,
that I admired that conduct in my Dolor Es which I should have
detested in other people. For instance, if I had seen Miss Jones or
Miss SMITH making peculiar play with her knife, or pulling out a
toothpick after dinner, what would have been my feelings
But I only saw perfection in Dolob Es.
THE DOINGS OF NICHOLAS!
The noble ladies of England, who smiled so sunnily upon the EMPERoR
of Russia, will doubtless feel interested to know that that mighty
Potentate—so tall, and such a handsome man l—has issued an order K
prohibiting all natives of Poland from marrying, till they have completed
their thirtieth year ! Nicholas by certain sycophants has been called
the “father of his people ;” the lawful title of “grandfather” he is ||
evidently not inclined to. Nicholas has also ordered the suppression of
all Temperance Societies throughout Poland. Thus the Emperor hopes
to choose for his Polish Ministers two most diabolic agents—Lust and

THE Hilary Battue has just concluded, and the result has been on the

WE do not profess to be in the secrets of the Bank Parlour, but
having seen the Governor sitting on one chair with his legs on another,
we should say that the addition to the “rest” will be very consider-
able. There is an unhealthy buoyancy in coupons for the Old Account;
and money is still so abundant, that nobody knows what to do with it.
We have offered anybody any amount at anything per cent., but we
can find nobody ready to avail himself of our proposition.

A SWIMMING MATCH. -
THE Great Britain has taken a couple of sea-baths since her release
from the dock of Bristol. At the first plunge, her timbers shivered very
much ; but she soon struck out, smoking all the time, in a style that
proved her to be up to a rig or two in swimming. The Great Britain has
since undertaken, for several hundreds, to swim to New York and back
again in less than a month.
Royal Sportsmanship.
PRINCE ALBERT and his party started off after a hare, but in the middle
of the run returned to the Castle to attend a Privy Council. This having
been disposed of, the run was resumed, the hare having sat itself quietly
down on a mile-stone while the Prince went to Windsor to pay attention
to his duties. The feeling entertained by the hare, was evidently that of
“business first and pleasure afterwards.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH...-OF ALIENATION BY MATTER OF
RECORD.
NCIENTLY this subject embraced four divisions,
two of which, fines and recoveries, hav-
ing been recently abolished, we are hap-
pily saved from the penalty of having to
describe a fine, and being made quite ill
by explaining the mysteries of a recovery.
Two branches of the subject still, how-
cver, remain, namely, Private Acts of
Parliament, and Royal Grants, which,
after stropping the penknife of acuteness
on the hone of industry, and nibbing the
pen of perseverance, we proceed to
M plunge into.
Private Acts of Parliament are fre-
quently used to disentangle an estate
from the confusion into which the law
has contrived to get it by surrounding it with contingent remainders—
springing uses—which are generally useless—resulting trusts—it is doubt-
ful if a turnpike-gate is a trust of this description—and other artificial
contrivances.
To attempt to put an end to confusion by an Act of Parliament,
seems to savour of rendering the said confusion worse confounded. Such
acts are very cautiously granted, and are declared to be void if contrary
to law and reason; though this is a very nice point, for if it is contrary
to law, it may be perfectly conformable to reason; and if consistent with
reason, the chances are that law has been lost sight of.
Royal grants, whether of landsor.honours, are conferred by litera patentes.
Grants or letters patent must always begin with a bill. “Ay,” says
Spelman, “and end with a bill too; for, marry come up ! there is no getting
letters patent without paying a pretty long bill for them.” The sovereign
signs them at the top with his own hand. “Whyche,” says Coke, who
must claim the merit of having invented the now venerable joke, “whyche
sygne is a sine quá non in alle letterres patente.” Coke, however, with
all his waggery was wrong, for the sovereign is not compelled to sign every
new patent for life pills, infallible mixtures for the hair, and other articles
which are continually being made the subject of royal letters patent.
Royal grants are always to be construed most beneficially for the sovereign
and against the party; while a grant from a subject is construed on
exactly the opposite principle. Thus, if a sovereign grants the trees on
certain land without the right of coming to take them, the subject
can have no other enjoyment of them but such as he can derive
from looking at them at a distance. If, however, a subject should grant
the sovereign a pint of new milk, it seems that the cow would follow as a
matter of course, because there can be no new milk without a cow; and
a fortiori, the cow must be fed—so that it is a nice point whether the
land in which the cow was turned out would not run with the milk, in-
stead of the milk running with the land, as it certainly would do if the
land were granted to the sovereign.
If the sovereign grants anything by mistake, he has the subject of the
t back again; so that a royal exclamation of “Hallo l what have I
been about 1 I didn't mean to do that,” will revoke the strongest grant
in existence. If the property granted is worth more than the king or
queen thought it was, he or she may take it back again. And, in fact,
under almost any circumstances, a thing given by a sovereign to a subject
is subject to be made the subject of recapture. -
Fines have been happily discontinued since the 31st of December, 1833,
which, according to a pun in pencil on the 989th page of the fifteenth
volume of PETERspoRFF's Abridgment, is “the finest thing that could
have happened for the simplicity of the legal system.” The quaint old
jeu on the mot fines is neatly pointed out by a strong italicising of the
word finest. -
Though fines and recoveries were abolished by the 3rd and 4th
of William IV. ch. 74, the benefit of them was preserved ; but as
this benefit chiefly benefited the lawyers, the advantage does not appear
particularly obvious. Thus a tenant in tail may cut off his own tail
by means of a pair of scissors, with which the law has provided
him, in the shape of the protector of the settlement. If there is
any estate in lands prior to the estate tail, the owner of the prior
ostate shall be the protector of the settlement. Where the pro-
tector of a settlement is an idiot, the LoRD CHANcellon, as stock repre-
sentative of all idiots, comes in to supply his place ; and if a traitor or
felon is the protector, the Court of Chancery generally undertakes the
arduous character.
A GOOD CHARACTER FROM HIS LAST PLACE.
We would recommend to the attention of Lond Ellenborough, as he
is out of a situation, this from the Times of Monday week:—
W ANTED, a Person with a thorough knowledge of fustian. Unexcep-
tionable references required.
THE RAILWAY MONITOR.
To Travellers,
THE existing railway arrangements render it imperative that you should
provide yourselves with a large stock of philosophy, to enable you to put
up with certain inconveniences, which you will be sure, to a greater or
less extent, to encounter on most lines, and
whereof a classification is hereby appended
for your benefit.
FIRST CLASS.
The chief inconvenience peculiar to this
class, is, that your fare will be about twice as
much as you ought in fairness to pay. You
run, perhaps, rather less risk in this class
than in the others, of having your neck
broken ; but you must not be unprepared for
such a contingency.
SECOND CLASS.
In travelling by the second class, you will do well to wear a respirator,
unless you wish to be choked with dust
and ashes from the engine close in front
º of you. Also, if you are going far, you
are recommended to put on a diving-
dress, like that used at the Poly-
technic ; because, if it should rain
much during your journey, the sides of
the carriage being open, you will have
to ride in a pool of water. , Your dig-
nity must not be hurt, should you have
for next neighbour a ragamuffin in
handcuffs, with a policeman next him.
The hardness of your seat is a mere
trifle; that is the least of the annoy-
ances to which you are judiciously sub-
jected, with the view of driving you into
the first class train.
THIRD CLASS.
Make up your mind for unmitigated hail, rain, sleet, snow, thunder and
lightning. Look out for a
double allowance of smoke,
dust, dirt, and everything that
is disagreeable. Be content
to run a twofold risk of loss
of life and limb. Do not ex-
pect the luxury of a seat. As
an individual and a traveller,
you are one of the lower
classes; a poor, beggarly,
contemptible person, and - - - -
your comfort and conveni. Yº ſº ----->
ence are not to be attended - -
to.
ALL THREE classes.
Punctuality may be the
soul of business, but suppose
not that it is the spirit of
railways. If you do not care
whether you keep an appoint-
ment or not, make it on the
faith of the Company, by
all means; but otherwise, -
by none. Regard starting, or arriving at your destination, only half an
hour too late, as luck. You pay nothing extra to attendants for civility,
so you must not hope for it. Remember that you are at the mercy of the
Company as to where you may stop for refreshments; for which, accord-
ingly, be not surprised if you have to pay through the nose. Beware, if
you quit the train for an instant, lest it move on ; you have paid your
money, the rest is your own look-out, and, you may depend will be no one
else's. For loss and damage of luggage, and the like little mishaps, pre-
pare yourself as a matter of course; and if at the end of your journey you
find yourself in a whole skin—thank your stars.

THEATRICAL INTELLIGENCE.
(By the Observer's Own Correspondent.)
2 INCE last month the testimonial received by
MR. BALFE has been the subject of conversa-
tion in theatrical circles, and the opinion
seems to be that he is a clever man, which
sº there can be no doubt of, at least we have
never questioned it to a certain extent, though
some have their opinions, as they have a per-
fect right to have, upon this as well as any
other subject. Whether a breakfast service
was the most appropriate mode of rewarding
merit, it is not for us to say, but at all events
MR. BALFE was justified in taking it, indeed
no man more so, because it was intended for
- him”; and though there are many very clever
- men, yet altogether we hardly think any one
else had a right on the present occasion to expect it. GARRick never took
a breakfast service on the stage of the theatre, it is true; but then it must
be remembered that the Roscius never had one offered to him, at least that
we know of, though we can't be expected to know some things, or indeed,
sometimes anything. As we have said before, and will say again and
again if we think it right, but even if we do there may be no occasion to
repeat it, that if the public will pay certain compliments, nobody ought to
find fault, and especially MR. Balfe, who would be very ungratefuſif he
were to turn round and complain, which we never charged him with.
PUNCH'S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER XLVIII.
FROM A BACHELOR TO A HUSBAND on THE Accomplish MENTS
OF HIS WIFE,
MY DEAR SIMPson,
As an old, old friend, I feel no hesitation
in addressing you upon a subject, which the
weakness of most people makes a very nice and
delicate one. Married men are, I know, ridicu-
lously sensitive to opinions passed by their
friends upon their wives. You, my dear fellow, are not of these.
No : you remain unchanged by matrimony; you are the same
transcendent philosopher you ever were. Hence, I feel that I can
talk to you about your wife as upon any other subject that tests a
man's better taste. I can criticise your helpmate with the same free
judgment that I would pass upon your horses or your wines. Feel-
ing this, I the more readily respond to your request, and tell you at
once freely and frankly “what I think” of the lady whom the com-
plaisance of the world denominates your better half.
I had prepared myself, from what you had said, to see a full-
blown, radiant beauty. Now, my dear boy, your wife is not brilliantly
handsome, certainly not. She has, however, a very pleasing face—
very nice, expressive eyes; very nice. And when she has seen a
little more of the world—when, too, she can have benefited more by
your counsel—so that she may achieve a little more self-control, she
will, I have no doubt, be a very charming, comfortable sort of little
body. At present—now what I say, SIMPson, accept as the surest
proof of my friendship for you—at present, there is now and then an
air of constraint, and then, again, an air of forced vivacity about
her, that is hardly natural to good society. This little defect, how-
ever, time and your good judgment will remedy.
Her conversation is sprightly; certainly sprightly. I did not how-
ever—and I assure you I watched most vigilantly—I did not detect
in it those flashes of wit, that radiant fancy, of which, ere you made
the lady your wife, you wrote to me so much. Matrimony, however,
may be fatal to these good gifts; wit and fancy may not submit to
the small circle of a wedding-ring. For myself, there is nothing I
admire so much in a woman as a discreet silence; nothing that so
much annoys me as her vain attempts to shine. If anything can take
the beauty from beautiful lips, it is when they evidently try to drop
pearls and diamonds, and let fall nothing worth the picking up. I
will not say that MRs. SIMPson does this; certainly not ; neverthe-
less, my dear friend, you may teach her with great advantage that
now and then the best adornment of a wife is taciturnity.
You were wont to praise your wife's temper. I have so much
respect for your judgment, that I am sure no artifices of courtship
could blind you to a defect. And yet, my dear fellow, the whole
education of woman from the cradle to the altar is one long course
of—no, hang it ! I will not say deceit. Bachelor as I am, and intend
for ever to be, I will not put down that ugly word. Nevertheless, it
is extraordinary how women can hide their real temper until the
parson, as they think, gives them a legal right to show it. It is
really wonderful to know how very long talons may sleep in the
velvet paw of courtship before the “amen” of the clerk calls them
out. I cannot think it is thus with MRs. SIMPson : oh, no. Still I
watched her—and my heart had a slight misgiving when I saw her
frown at your ventured opinion, that the sweet sauce was a little
burnt. However, perhaps it may have been only her peculiar mode
of look, and not a frown. You, my dear boy, know best; for who,
indeed, ought to judge between man and wife
Touching your wife's music, I do not think her ear very good, but
it may be improved. Her voice—to be sure it may have altered
since you wrote so much about it—is thin as wire; and by the way,
not silver wire. Her execution is a little too hurried; as though she
would hide defects under an assumed brilliancy of fingering. All
this, however, time and practice may remedy. Apropos, who taught
her Italian Her pronunciation—in a word, my dear fellow, your
wife's Italian—Lancashire witch as she is—is Lancashire Italian.
However, who in a wife—as wives are made by present education
—is to expect perfection ? You, my dear friend, were ever too
philosophic, too wise, to look for excellence, and therefore will, I
have no doubt, be very comfortable with your present little helpmate.
Doubtless, you might have done better—but then, again, you might
have done worse, and so, all things considered, it is as well as it is,
You asked me, “what I thought of your wife—candidly?” I have
endeavoured to illustrate my old friendship for you by giving you an
honest, ingenuous answer. All husbands are, I know, not to be so
openly dealt with. But the experience of twenty years tells me that
you are a friend and a philosopher. *
Ever, my dear SIMPson, yours truly,
FRANK DAvis.
P.S.—Remember : we dine at the Club on Thursday.
LETTER XLIX.
THE HUSBAND'S ANSWER.
DEAR DAvis,
Your frankness is charming—delightful How few friends
would have had the fine moral courage to write such a letter How
well, too, have you judged of my philosophy. I assure you, I have
laughed—laughed heartily at your epistle : it has amused me
mightily.
As for Mrs. SIMPson's beauty, why in a wife, I take it, that is a
particular which has peculiar reference to her husband. To be sure,
beauty may exist, and some eyes never see it. I wonder now, what
the mole or the owl really and truly thinks of the sun ? But doubt-
less, you can tell.
It is quite true, that MRs. SIMPson has some feminine diffidence.
She was not, unfortunately you may think, brought up in a garrison ;
and has never yet headed the conversation in a mess-room. I believe
the age of silver preceded the age of brass. -
As for her wit and fancy, you know, my dear sir, how difficult it

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
is to define those qualities: how much more difficult with some
people to appreciate them. How very much they are wasted upon
them. I know, in some countries, it is the fashion to hang the heads
of mules with melodious, semi-toned bells; but whoever could hope
that the brutes should understand their beautiful modulation ?
The temper of Mrs. SIMPson is—but it is not for a husband to
expatiate on the household excellences of his wife. No ; they are
too sacred in their nature to be defiled by ink: they are to be
respected, worshipped, in the innermost core of the conjugal heart.
I may merely observe this—Mns. SIMPson merer frowns. My wine
is, I know, potent, and—dear sir—you were evidently very thirsty.
Hence, you may not be accountable for the then haziness of your
Vision.
Your exceeding thirst, too—seeing how industriously you tried to
sate it—may have rendered you a little unfit to criticise music. We
all know what PAN thought of Apollo.
With respect to my appointment to dine at the Club, I have this
morning—at the request of MRs. Simpson—withdrawn my name as
a member. Hence, I cannot have the pleasure of meeting you. Never-
theless, I am,
Yours obliged,
John S1MPson.
Turtle for the Million."
LAST summer the metropolis was inundated with fourpenny pine-apples,
and though ship-load after ship-load arrived in the Docks, “the cry was
still, they come.” This cheap luxury having retired for the season, we are
promised real turtle for sixteen people out of a 2 lb. tin, being, by-the-by,
about a gravy-spoon per head, or rather per mouth, of this most salacious
relish. It seems that there was a good deal of mockery in the alleged
real turtle of olden times, which has been nearly as delusive as the actual
mock in vogue at the pastrycooks'. The cheap turtle is made from the
fish seized while sporting in their native waters, caught in the first gush
of confidence and “preserved under patent at Honduras,” before they
have time to feel the terrors of their situation, and lose any of their
liveliness.
AMUSEMENTS FOR THE RICH.
EREBY Punch presents his compli-
ments to illustrious personages,
the nobility and gentry, and re-
spectfully begs to condole with
them, on account of a sad cala-
mity which they labour under.
He has learned, with the great-
est pain, that thousands of the
higher orders are almost perish-
ing for want of employment. It
is a long time to go between
breakfast and dinner, when the
latter is at seven, even though
the former should be at twelve,
~ with an empty head. That this
is very generally the case among them, is too plain to Punch, from the
character of fashionable mornings' amusements. Sitting over and over
again for a wretched portrait, under the vain idea of encouraging art,
and inspecting china and poodles, pony-driving, coursing, otter-hunting,
destroying game, and duelling, show a lamentable want of resources.
During a large portion of the year there are no concerts, or fêtes of
any sort. Evening parties and fancy dress balls soon become monotonous.
Theatres (Her Majesty's excepted) are out of the question; and happy
are those whom want of occupation does not drive to the gaming-table.
This state of things ought not to last. The minds of the better orders
must be employed, or they will very soon be the worse. Might Punch
suggest, for a frolic, the idea of making business a pleasure ? There are
various useful offices, and pursuits which might be undertaken gra-
tuitously. The elite of ton might become amateur tailors and milliners,
taking, for amusement, part of the labour of the working classes off their
shoulders. They might occasionally officiate as linen-drapers' assistants,
giving the shopmen a holiday. . They might now and then guide the
spindle and direct the loom, or take a turn at the plough, or the mangle,
for fun.
Some of our younger gentry might volunteer, for a short change, as
policemen, instead of giving occasion for their services. But these are
mere hints. The matter ought to be taken up. The Rich require
amusement equally with the Poor; they are dying for want of it; and
that useful body, the aristocracy, is bidding fair to become extinct. Punch
expects that England—that is to say, Young England—will do its duty.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
chapTER THE NINETEENTH,-of Alienation By special custom.
ssukANCEs by special custom are confined to copy-
holders and their tenants, whom the law
regards as very special customers. A copy-
holder is strictly speaking a villain, and those
holding under him are, a fortiori, more vil-
lanous; for copyholds all have their origin
in pure villenage. A surrender is an assu-
rance by special custom ; and it is managed
by A., the copyholder or villain, coming to
B., the lord or his steward, and giving up a
rod or a glove to B., who gives it to C., the
copyholder elect or villain that is to be, and
who swears to perform all the conditions to
which A., the ex-villain, was subjected. The
last public case of this kind was when that
honest fellow, but pure villain, the late
square-keeper of Golden-square, resigned
the cane to the present worthy villain, who
has ever since wielded it. He swore fealty
to the trustees, and took an oath of extermi-
nation to little boys at the foot of the statue
—which was all according to the custom of the manor.
When an estate is once surrendered the lord of the fee must admit the
surrenderee, and writing up the words “No admittance” will not cut off
the right of the surrenderee, who may insist on being let in ; and he may
continue knocking and ringing, or kicking up a row till he is let in, for
the law will assist him.
The same rule applies to heirs, married women, infants, and lunatics,
who must all be admitted en an estate being surrendered to them ; but an
infant must be let in through his guardian, as infants often are, and a
married woman must be let in, through her attorney, as occasionally
happens; a lunatic must have a committee to represent him, but it does
not seem that the committee need have a chairman, or any of the usual
requisites. In lunatics’ committees, one is a quorum, but there is always
an appeal to the Lord Chancellor, who is, by virtue of his office, the
representative of all monied idiots.
COMIC SONGS FOR YOUNG LADIES.
Young gentlemen of England,
That only mind your ease,
Ah, little do you think how hard
Young ladies try to please I
Give ear unto the Milliners,
And they will plainly show
How the waist must be laced,
By the Fashion-books to go.
She who'd attract attention
Must laugh at common sense,
For when one goes to choose a dress,
One mustn't mind expense;
Northink how Pa will scold one,
Whene'er he comes to know
How he's let into debt,
By the Fashion-books to go.
What terrible privations
Young ladies must endure,
A lovely face and form of grace
From damage to secure :
Their appetites they must control,
Lest they too stout should grow,
And in vain strive and strain,
By the Fashion-books to go.
In days of bitter weather,
Which winter doth enforce,
One cannot think of such a thing
As good thick boots, of course;
With instep undefended,
In rain, and hail, and snow,
All so bold one gets cold,
By the Fashion-books to go.
INDISPOSITION OF THE THAMES.
We regret to state that Father Thames has been in a very low state

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 261
THE LANDLORD’S FRIEND society.
ARLY in the present week, this body—newly-
constituted in imitation of the
Labourer's Friend Society—held its
first meeting ; though, strangely
enough, no report of the proceed-
ings has as yet appeared in the
papers.
The chair (a three-legged stool)
was taken by JAcon THATch, a
gaunt, sallow-faced labourer, look-
ing sixty, though in reality but
thirty-two. He briefly stated the
- objects of the society. He said, it
was very kindly meant of many
gentlemen to meet and talk so much
—for they never spared talk—about
the condition of the labourer. He
himself had been at a good many of
such meetings; but somehow or the
other, he always came away hungrier
than he went. He now thought it
was the duty of the labourers to
return the kindness of landlords; and
by meeting and talking over their
destitute condition—moral condition
he believed was the word—to see
what could be done for them. (Cheers.)
There could be no doubt that many
of the landlords were in a desperate
forlorn state, not knowing right from
\ wrong; and it was the duty of
* labourers as Christians—if he wasn't
= going too far in calling them Christ-
=ians—to teach them the proper path.
== It was only due to their peace in this
sworld, and their happiness in the
Y world to come. (Cheers.)
V. GILEs Acohn proposed the first
resolution. He said he didn't wish
to brag, but he believed he was
rather a goodish player at put and
checkers. (Hear.) Well, he believed
a good deal might be done among
—"Tºº landlords by mixing oftener with
them, and making more free like.
To prove that he was in earnest, he had no objection to play a
few games at put with the Duke of MARLBoRough, or any other
such landlord: he thought it would do the Duke good. There was
no knowing how his heart might be opened at put, just as the gentle-
folks did so much for the wants of the poor when they played at
cricket with 'em.
Hodge Sow THIstle seconded the resolution. He didn't know
much about dice; that is, he didn't know the rigs of 'em ; he had
raffled once in better days for a goose, and won it. He wouldn't at
all mind, however, playing at hap-hazard, that’s what he believed
entlefolks called it—with any landlord in a destitute state of feeling
for the labourer. He had heard a goodish deal of late of a little gen-
tleman called Young England. Well, he wouldn't mind playing a
game at ring-taw with the child, if he'd fairly knuckle down. The
knuckling-down, however, was what they wanted to catch the land-
lords at (cheers); whereas, with all their fine words, he believed there
was a great deal of funking.
SIMIon Clod moved the second resolution. He said the whole of
the fact was, they had too long neglected landlords as their fellow-
creatures: they never went among 'em. Whereas—as having their
good at heart, and showing 'em that they thought 'em only men, like
themselves—they ought to go into their houses, to see what sorts of
beds they slept upon—to see 'em at their dinners, and to teach 'em,
what it's plain they didn't well understand, the blessings of a good
appetite, and the curse of hunger with nothing to satisfy it. It was
plain that many landlords believed the labourer couldn't eat at all.
Now they had only to undeceive 'em in their own larders to bring
about a great blessing. Certain gentlefolks often came to the
labourer's dwelling, and never seeing nothing in the cupboard, in
course believed that the labourers and their wives and children never
wanted food. They had only to dine at the landlords' houses to teach
'em the contrary. Although he'd rather have his bit of bacon at his
own fireside—that is, where there ought to be a fire—he would,
nevertheless, to assist the society, dine with as many landlords as
was thought fit. Moreover, he had six children, and they should all
go and dine along with him. (Cheers.)
ZAchARY CHAFF seconded the resolution,. He said the last
speaker had hit the nail upon the very head. It was as plain as the
Union, that most of the landlords believed that labourers never
wanted to eat at all. That they were like the threshing-machines,
that might go on beating out the corn without ever wanting to taste
it. They ought—poor souls l—to be taught the truth. He was sure
all they wanted to learn was that the labourer was flesh and blood–
and, indeed, how few of 'em present at that meeting looked anything
like it—to treat 'em as such. For himself, he didn't know what a
dinner was ; nevertheless, for the souls' sake of the landlords—and
he feared a lot of 'em was very dark indeed—he'd dine with twenty
of 'em if the Society thought it right. (Cheers.)
These and other resolutions were unanimously passed, when the
Chairman rose and said—The best part of the business was to come.
They had to give out the prizes to certain landlords for their noble
and feeling conduct towards the labourer.
Hereupon Lond FitzwhEEDLE was introduced, when the Chair-
man addressed him as follows:–
“Lord FitzwhEEDLE, you have shown yourself to be the la-
bourer's friend. You play at cricket capital. For a lord, your
bowling is special good. You have this season in the handsomest
manner played three games with nothing better than as you call 'em
the sons of the soil; and for this noble conduct, the Society presents
you with this piece of stick, upon which may be notched your future
runs. We hope, my Lord, that you will show this bit of stick to all
the Club folks in London. We hope that you will let this bit of
stick go down, so that your sons' sons may have it—every one of
'em ; and that the world may for ever know that Lord FITz-
wheep LE was a good cricket-player, and therefore the labourer's
friend.” (Cheers.)
His Lordship endeavoured to address the meeting. His feelings
were too much for him : he merely said, “Bless—bless—bless the
labourer 1’’ then burst into tears, and pressed the stick to his heart.
The DUKE of SMALL.Borough was next introduced, and received
a bunch of dried dandelions for being—of all landlords—the very best
to stop. The Duke returned thanks in an affecting speech.
After certain minor formalities, the meeting separated.
THE BUSS-DRIVER's LAMENT over BYGONE DAYS.
I've known the time, alas 'tis past!
When I might drive my buss
Through thick and thin, go slow or fast,
And no one make a fuss.
When we, that is, myself and cad,
Could o'er our pewters slumber;
But, stop an instant now, and, 'gad'ſ
The pºliceman's got your number.
I've known the time when I might race
With Cloud or ShillibeeR,
Down Cheapside, at a furious pace,
Without a moment's fear;
When if I spilt an apple-stall,
Or overran a few,
I only got a fine, that's all,
And went to work anew.
But times and beaks are sadly changed
I can't abide that BRoughton;
Lord Mayors among my foes are ranged,
With MALTBY and with Norton.
But, O, there’s one / he likes his task,
(And we're the class he's foe to.)
Whose persecutions make me ask,
“Where HARDwick thinks he’ll go to 1"
NATIONAL LUNACY.
We seriously advise the Great Powers of Europe to hold a commission
“De Lunatico Inquirendo” on Spain: her distracted state proving that
she is incapable of managing her own affairs.

L
CHARITY is said to begin at home, but it has lately been going out, and
we are happy to announce that certain miserable objects, who have
long been suffered to remain in a state of destitution in the public streets
of the metropolis, are about to have something done for them. The public
must, for some time past, have noticed a miserable object standing in St.
Paul's Churchyard, who seems from her destitute condition to be sadly in
want of Queen Anne's, or anybody else's bounty; the poor creature has had
themselves, and the result is that before the frost sets thoroughly in, he
will be provided with a sentry-box. -
CHARLEs THE FIRST, who not only suffered during his own reign,
but during every shower that has fallen since, will be provided with
a capacious gingham umbrella; but the horse will be left to his fate, the
presumption being that the brute is by this time used to it.

The shelterless condition of the DUKE of York has also been taken
into consideration, for he stands like patience on a thermometer, smiling
at freezing-point. Why should he be worse off than the common sentinel
at his feet Such is the question some humane persons have asked
opposite the Houses of Parliament, or assuming the appearance, as some
suppose, of a ghost expressly to haunt PEEL and WELLINGTON, and a few
others who are said to have worried him in or rather out of his hiſe. The
statue of CANNING is to be provided with a pilot coat to keep him warm, and
distinguish him from PITT, the other pilot, who succeeded in weathering
the storm raised by his enemies.
PEEL'S PROMENADE CONCERTS.
THE public is respectfully informed, that the Theatre Royal, St.
Stephen's, will open for a series of
Promenade Concerts,
early in February next. The instruments will comprise the usual
amount of wind and brass, while the music selected will embrace a variety
of different tunes, uniting numerous extraordinary changes of notes and
a curious collection of measures.
Among the solo performers will be LoRD BRough AM, whose eccentric
performances on one string, introducing the grand theme of his treatment
by the Whigs, will be repeated occasionally throughout the season.
SIR JAMEs GRAHAM will preside at the big drum, or grosse caisse, and
will introduce the well-known letter duet, which is peculiarly adapted for
the big drum, being one of the grossest cases that ever happened.
Sir Robert PEEL will have the honour to attempt a concerted peace
with Mons. Guizot ; and an engagement will be offered to MR. FERRAND
to act as second or third fiddle, introducing some of his celebrated feats
with the long-bow, in the use of which he is quite unrivalled. Further
particulars will be announced in future bills, which will be brought for the
purpose of being read as soon as possible.
A TRIFLE FOR JONES.
George Jones complains of our accusing him of having “scarcely any
punctuation.” He certainly does not know where to stop.
WATERLOO BRIDGE REPORT.
This document is more than usually encouraging. It states that there
has been a distribution of three-and-twopence amongst the annuitants,
and a division as usual among the proprietors—as to the mode, of
managing the affairs of the company—being the only division of which
they have yet had the benefit. An allusion was made to the Hungerford
concern, and it was suggested they should now buckle on their armour;
upon which a proprietor wished to know whether it was meant by buck-
ling on their armour to put the man at the toll-gate in a helmet and
breastplate, in order to attract passengers. A proposition was also
brought forward on the subject of touting; and it was under discussion
for some time, whether men should be employed to hoot all persons going
over Hungerford Bridge, and “chaff” the tollkeeper of the rival concern.
It was, however, agreed, that the Suspension affair would only be brought
into notice by this sort of thing, and it would therefore be better to leave
it alone, so that it might “ hang itself in its own chains,” as a mortgagee
of ten shares in Waterloo prettily expressed it.
Ilegal Intelligence.
OUR learned friend MR. BRIEFLEss has paired off with SIR WILLIAM
Follert for the sittings after Hilary. No arrangement to this effect was
specially entered into, but it is an understood thing that MR. BRIEFLEss
will not hold a brief until after the return of Mr. Attorney from the
Continent. Should SIR WILLIAM go to the Privy Council as presiding
Judge, MR. BRIEFLEss will, of course, feel himself at liberty to assume
whatever attitude he may think advisable.

They were Gallegos going to Lisbon for service; and I wished that
a better hand than mine—viz., one of those immortal pencils which
decorate the columns of our dear Punch—had been there to take cog-
nizance of these strange children of the South—in their scarfs and
their tufted hats, with their brown faces shining as they lay under
the sun.
Nor were these the only new passengers; with them came on
board a half-dozen of Hungarian cloth-sellers, of one of whom here
is the accurate portrait as he lay upon two barrels, and slept the
sleep of innocence sub Jore.

A GUIDE Tó SINGLE LADIES.
I. BEwARE how you accept an invitation from an industrious widow or
an indefatigable old maid “to spend the day,” especially if she should add,
“Come early, love, and bring your work.”. Be assured that very soon
after you arrive, a heap of linen-drapery will be piled on the table, and
you will be asked “just to run up a seam or two,” and then to “fit on the
boddice, like a dear.” When that is done, she will apologise for not hav-
ing anything to amuse you. If you are obliged to accept such an invita-
tion, be sure to ask your mama if you may ask CHARLEs to fetch you home
at night—“about nine.” Write to him immediately, telling him not to be
a minute later than six.
II. Should a similar invitation come from a young lady who is in your
confidence, by all means take every one of CHARLEs's love-letters; you
will find them very pleasant reading after your friend has shown you all
her lover's presents, and told you all his secrets.
III. When you are invited to a diner de prétention, be sure to dine
very heartily before you start. As, however, merely looking on is dull
work, take a huge bouquet. This should emit an odour strong enough to
spoil the appetites of the men who sit next to you, so that they may have
the more time to flirt and talk. Be perfectly ignorant of the name of
every dish ; for to be suspected of the smallest cognizance of cookery is
disgustingly vulgar. Should any old-fashioned man ask you to take wine,
give him a glance of unconsciousness, and turn to one of your neighbours
to ask what is meant? That explained, you may take up an empty glass,
and set it down again, bowing at the same time to the épergne.
IV. When you are going out to a grand quadrille party, you will, of
course, be obliged to wear a very expensive and very extensive dress;
* Though our fat friend's log has been in the present instance a little tedious, the
observant reader may nevertheless draw from it a complete and agreeable notion of the
rise, progress, and conclusion of the malady of sea-sickness. He is exhausted; he is
melancholy; he is desperate; he rejects his victuals; he grows hungry, but dares not
eat ; he mends; his spirits rise; all his faculties are restored to him; and he eats with
redoubled vigour. This fine diagnosis of the maritime complaint, we pronounce from
experience may be perfectly relied upon.
stipulate, therefore, for the whole of one side of the coach, that the skirt
may be spread over it and not be tumbled. Never mind getting your
poor and unattractive cousin squeezed up on the other seat between your
two fat uncles. If, when you arrive, CHARLEs should bore you, tell him
you have made up your mind not to dance that night; but the moment he
has engaged another partner, waltz away with the handsomest man you
can get. Be handed down to supper if possible by a title, if it is only a
Captain. The next morning, when CHARLEs calls, ask him how he dares
show his face “after his cruel neglect of you last evening.”

THE CROWN OF SCOTLAND.
BE it premised that we write not of Caledonia's diadem, exhibited
for testers in Edinburgh Castle; but of the five shillings—the
crown “received from Scotland” for the benefit of a Scottish
heroine. The subjoined advertisement, however, briefly narrates
the history of the matter. It is from the Times of the 30th ult.:—
SCºANR and her Heroine of Matagorda.-On the 30th and 31st of
October, Appeals, couched in terms as strong as they were sincere, were addressed
to “The Sons and Daughters of Scotland,” through the papers of Edinburgh and
Glasgow, calling on them to contribute to a Fund that has been in course of subscription
in this metropolis to purchase an Annuity or Pension of something like ls. 6d. a-day for
a poor old woman, AGNEs REston, a native of Scotland, who, 30 years ago, won for
herself from the Peninsular armies the name of Heroine of Matagorda, but who has,
since then, been grievously neglected, until now, in her 72d year, she toils for her bread
in the office of a nurse in the Town’s Hospital of Glasgow. It was promised in those
appeals that an acknowledgment should be inserted in the Times of November 30, of
the sums that, in answer to them, should be generously forwarded to the office of Messrs.
Cox, of Craig's Court: to redeem that promise, it is here acknowledged that the amount
received from Scotland ...}. 5s., forwarded by MR. DAv1D CRoll, of Glasgow.
N.B. During the same period (one month) 434 has been contributed in England.
We are afraid that we recognise a little malice in the above.
True, it may be, that Scotland has only sent five shillings to Eng-
land; but who shall say what amount of money Scotland may have
contributed that England knows nothing of Scotland, with a noble
jealousy, may have refused to mingle her large subscriptions with
Southron mites. No ; she may have reasoned—and acted upon the
thought—“AgNEs Reston belongs to us : she is our own heroine;
a native of enthusiastic, impulsive Scotland; and we want no English
aid; we will do the goodly work alone and unassisted.”
There can be little doubt that it is owing to this laudable and
patriotic feeling that MEssRs. Cox, of Craig's Court, London, have
received five shillings only from Scotland. Money has of course
been subscribed throughout that country; a committee has doubtless
been formed at Glasgow; and—although we have yet seen no report
of the matter in the papers—the eighteen-pence per day has been
assured to AGNEs REston ; and the Heroine of Matagorda is no
longer a worn-out drudge in the Town's Hospital, but, for her few
remaining days, she has secured to her an easy competence by the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SERVANT S' HAL L.
THE Livery of London—we do not mean the Freemen, but the Foot-
men—have got up, among themselves, an Institution with the above title.
At this Hall young candidates for service are examined—if they please;
so that it is such another Hall as Apothecaries' Hall will be if SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM's bill passes. The Examiners are six footmen, and as many
coachmen, with an experienced butler for President. They meet at a
certain public-house; and though their society, like their master's, is ex-
clusive, our reporter got admitted to one of their meeting; by pretending
to be a valet out of place. We subjoin the examination of a Footman.
Q. What is your views?—A. A nobleman or gentleman's family.
Q. How would you set about brushing a coat?—A. I’d begin by
searching the pockets. (“Wery good.”)
Q. What is wales 1–A. All fish as comes to net ; more 'specially tips.
Q. What would be your duty to my Lord!—A. To attend upon him.
Q. What would be your duty to your profession ?—A. Not to attend
on my Lady. --
Q. Suppose her bell rung, and there was nobody but you to answer
it?–A. I should stop where I was.
Q. What ought you to mind —A. My own business.
Q. What ought you not to mind —A. Anybody else's.
Q. Suppose you was told to roll the lawn ——A. I should say it was
the gardener's place.
Q. If the coachman was took ill suddenly, would you consent for to
mount the box 3–4. Not by no means. (“Quite right, young man.”)
Q. What would you expect to have to do —A. To attend at table,
brush my Lord's hat and clothes, answer his bell, and deliver messages
for his Lordship ; but not for nobody else.
Q. Would you clean plate —A. I might condescend to do that.
Q. What would you expect —A. Not less than thirty pounds a year,
wages. (“Salary, Sir ; salary, if you please.”) I beg your parding; salary.
Q. What else?—A. Three suits of uniform ; cast off wardrobe ; and
four meals reg'lar a day.
This candidate passed at once ; and was highly complimented by the
Examiners on his attainments. Others were not so fortunate. One was
asked “Suppose, in a family where a boy was kept, you were called upon,
on a pinch, to clean boots and shoes; what would you do? He replied
“Clean them,” and was “plucked" immediately.
Another who wished to be a butler, was rejected on a catch question,
“How do you make a bottle of wine !” The answer expected was, “In
decanting a dozen.”
Some housekeepers displayed a very creditable knowledge of the per-
centages to be insisted on from different tradesmen. A lady's maid was
asked, Q. What is your chief business –A. To dress my mistress.
Q. What next —A. To dress myself.
Q. What would you do when your mistress was out 2—A. Go and put
on her clothes.
These answers were much applauded; as was also those of a valet, who,
to the question, “What coat ought a gentleman to wear at a swarrey !”
responded, “His master's best.” The examinations concluded, the whole
party regaled themselves upon beer and gin, provided by the examination
fees, which came to sixpence a head. -
MR. COMBE AGAIN.
T WILL any of our readers kindly inform us if there be at this
moment a Home Minister If so, is he in a mesmeric condition, or
really awake If awake, does he ever read those vulgar composi-
tions, the daily papers? And if not, why not
We have looked in our own Pocket-Book, and find that SIR JAMEs
GRAHAM is really Home Secretary. May we then call the attention of
SIR JAMEs to the manifold merits of MR. CoMBE, the magistrate of
Clerkenwell ? That man is a blighted Lord-Chief-Justice. He was
born to be wrapt in ermine—to sit upon the Queen's Bench. He
wears plain black, and is confined to an arm-chair. Such is life I
Again and again have we marvelled at the judgments of CoMBE.
They have at length convinced us that Apuleius is not wholly a fable.
No; sure we are that the spirit of a philosopher—albeit nobody shall
suspect it—may animate an ass.
We subjoin a brief police narrative, showing the wisdom of Mr.
Combe.
“John STEvens was charged with assaulting Mr. Thom As BANTING, dairyman,
John Street, Bedford Row. Complainant owed the assailant a sporting bet of 151,
Whereupon, STEvKN's entered complainant’s shop, and demanding the money, aimed a
violent blow with a large stick at his head. Witness put up his arm to ward it off, and
received the blow on it. The blow caused a swelling as large as a half-pint pot on the
elbow, and he has not had since then the use of the limb.”
Now, listen to MR. CoMBE :
“Mr. Combs. Why don't you pay Mr. Stevens the 151.7–CoMPLAINANT. I was
unable to do so, sir—other parties had not paid me.
“Mn. Combs. Nonsense! how is he to know whether they have or not? You had
better pay him the 15t. You are a long time in his debt.”
After more talk, MR. CoMBE hints at “a bill.”
“MR. CoMBE. The defendant asks for a bill.
the 15'., which you acknowledge you owe ?
... “The complainant said that after having received such treatment, he should be less
inclined to do so than ever.
“Mr. CoMBE. If you pay him the 151., I'll fine him for the assault.
“The complainant said he had been brutally treated, and declined the offer,
. “The defendant, who admitted that he was “a betting man,’ was merely bound over
in his own recognizance to answer any charge at the sessions.”
Is there not sweet comfort in this for creditors—for all betting men
with money owed them.” Gentlemen creditors, provide yourselves
with large sticks—enter the houses of your debtors—drub them
soundly; and if brought before MR. CoMBE he will use his gentle
offices to get you “a bill” from the man you have thrashed; and if
failing, will let you off upon your own recognisance
And then again, how courteous to attempt to make a bargain with
the stiff-necked complainant “If you pay him, I'll fine him.” But
the ruffian was not paid, and—equitable MR. Combe –he was not
fined.
Why don't you give him your bill for
ATROCITIES OF THE HAIR-CUTTERS.
ow; Mr. Punch, I am a man with a very bad
head of hair. There was, one time, at the
fairs, a Porcupine Man: now it is, indeed,
no vanity for me to say it, but I might in
my infancy have been shown as the Hedge-
hog Babe. I have, however, philosophy,
and what I have suffered at the hands of
Hair-cutters is a secret to be buried with
– me. Nevertheless, it is impossible for me
** to be silent on a growing abuse, seeing
that it aims at all men alike for its victims.
It is no matter whether a man has “hy-
acinthine locks,” as MR. Milton says, or
to a shock of hair familiarly known as a pound of candles:
is doomed
he is alike doomed to the importunities, the crushing civilities, the touting,
the chaffering of the Hair-dresser's man, who has evidently taken a
private oath that he will put off oil, pomatum, elixir, essence, or what-
ever name the quackery may lie under, upon any and every unfortunate
creature who may place his head in his hands. I have just rushed from
a barber's in the neighbourhood to solace myself with rump-steak and
stout at the Cock.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEW PATENT NOWEL WIRITER.
To MR. PUNCH.
SIR,
I have to apologise for some delay in answering your obliging
favour, in which you did me the honour of suggesting to me the manufac-
ture of a Lawyer's Clerk. After much consideration, I regret that I have
found it impossible to produce an article which should be satisfactory to
myself, and to the profession. I have, however, been completely success-
ful in the production of a New Patent Mechanical Novel Writer—
adapted to all styles, and all subjects; pointed, pathetic, historic, silver-
fork, and Minerva. I do not hesitate to lay before you a few of the
flattering testimonials to its efficacy, which I have already received from
those most competent to judge.
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
J. BABBAGE.
Testimonial from G. P. R. JAMEs, Esq., Author of “Darnley," and of
300 other equally celebrated works.
SIR,--It is with much pleasure I bear testimony to the great useful-
ness of your New Patent K. Writer. By its assistance, I am now
enabled to complete a novel in 3 vols. 8vo., of the usual size, in the short
space of 48 hours; whereas before, at least a fortnight's labour was
requisite for that purpose. To give an idea of its application to persons
who may be desirous cf trying it, I may mention that some days since I
placed my hero and heroine, peasants of Normandy, in the surprising-
adventure-department of the engine; set the machinery in motion, and,
on letting off the steam a few hours after, found the one a Duke, and the
other a Sovereign Princess; they having become so by the most natural
and interesting process in the world.
I am, Sir, your truly obliged servant,
J. BABBAGE, Esq. G. P. R. JAMEs.
Testimonial from SIR. E. L. Bulwen Lytton, BART.
I AM much pleased with MR. BABBAge's Patent Novel-Writer, which
produces capital situations, ornate descriptions, a good tone, sufficiently
unexceptionable ties, and a fund of excellent, yet accommodating morality.
I have suggested, and have therefore little doubt that MR. Babbage will
undertake, what appears to me to be still more a desideratum, the manu-
facture of a Patent Poet on the same plan.
E. L. Bulwen Lytton.
Testimonial from Lond WILLIAM LENNox, Author of Waverley.
Lord W. LENNox presents his compliments to MR. BABBAGE, and has
pleasure in stating that he finds the operation of the Patent Novel-Writer
considerably more expeditious than the laborious system of cutting by
hand. Lord W. has now nothing more to do than to throw in some
dozen of the most popular works of the day, and in a comparatively short
space of time draw forth a spick-and-span new and original Novel. Lord
... would suggest the preparation, on a similar plan, of a Patent Thinker,
to suggest ideas; in which he finds himself singularly deficient.
CONTINENTAL INTELLIGENCE.
CANNEs has become an English
colony, and some of the settlers
have adopted the manners and
costume of the natives with sin-
gular facility. LoRD BRough AM
has cultivated the long hair pecu-
liar to Young France, assumed
the Parisian swagger, and wants
nothing but the war-whoop to
enable him to exhibit, on his re-
turn, as a perfect specimen of the
natives amongst whom he has
located himself.
State of the Assault Market
at the Police Courts.
The past week has been some-
what dull. A few broken heads
(low people) went off at five shil-
lings each, and found purchasers
in gentlemen who afterwards went
away in their cabs. Ruffianly
assaults upon married women have -
been rather languid; but one—of -º
a very fine sort—by a gentleman
“who had dined,” was bought in
at forty shillings; the purchaser
evidently thinking he had a great
bargain. Two black eyes, and a
contused nose, were offered by poor
policemen. Although they might
have been bought at thirty shil-
lings each, they were suffered to
| remain on hand; those who had the option of being theJ.'." having
| no money, and—for such delinquency—being sent to
e House of Cor-
rection in the prison-van.
POLICE REPORT.-CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.
Two individuals, who gave their names respectively, as Rock and
Flight, were brought up on the serious charge of ill-treating a mare.
It appeared from the evidence that the animal, who answered to the
name of Michael, had been very roughly treated. The poor creature
had been seen to wince under it very frequently, but Rock replied that
“galled jades” always would “wince,” and he could not help it if Michael.
was in the predicament alluded to. It was proved that the poor thing had
been driven from St. Stephen's, Walbrook, to the Court of Chancery, very
much against its will.
getting into a-rear, and it was necessary to check the animal.
The magistrate asked whether the mare had any tricks.
Rock. Oh, several, your worship. I don't know whether I ought to
call it vice, but the mare is certainly very tricky.
Magistrate. But you ought not to ill-use the poor animal. Where is -
the creature now Does anybody own it !
Rock. I believe not, your worship. The mare is generally considered
not worth the expense of the keep.
The magistrate expressed a wish to see the animal, who said nothing
but “Neigh I neigh 1” and appeared very restive.
The prisoners were admonished and discharged.
RAILWAY INTELLIGENCE.
In Kensington the speculations for the closing have been fully realised,
for the railway has closed. A stoker and a kitchen-poker are thrown out
of employ by this catastrophe. The place of money-taker having been
always a sinecure, will, it is supposed, be continued as heretofore.

THE SCHOOLMASTER IN GLASGOW.
The flourishing city of Glasgow is blessed with a population of
nearly 300,000; it is further blessed with a yearly revenue of 17,000l.
and the city of Glasgow supports one public school. Possibly bigoted
to the foolish saw, that “a little learning is a dangerous thing,” the
Glasgow authorities, with characteristic prudence, do all they can to
lessen the evil. One BAILIE WHITE HEAD has, it appears, very
original opinions touching the dignity of learning; and has therefore
proposed to cut the schoolmaster to the quick; to make him a kind
of day-labourer—a respectable sort of stone-breaker.
There, are seven masters in the one public school of Glasgow.
Five of these have 50l. per annum each, with certain fees; the other
two must live on fees alone. Besides these, there is an old, retired
schoolmaster—a worn-out man—who has taught arithmetic and the
humanities to the present merchant princes of Glasgow. This man
receives a pension of 100 a year for his past hard labours. Altogether
i. is a yearly total of 500l. expended by Glasgow for public educa-
lon I
Now, BAILIE WHITEHEAD, in the breadth of his mind and the
depth of his heart, sees in all this a reckless, sinful extravagance.
The tree of learning is all very well, but it may be too richly
manured ; its apples, golden as they are, may cost too much.
Whereupon, the BAILIE proposes—with a benevolence that all men
must acknowledge—that the superannuated schoolmaster be, in his
old age, deprived of his pension . He might starve, to be sure; no,
not starve : for has not Scotland the beneficence of her peculiar
poor laws After this, the BAILIE would take the 50l. salary from
each of the five teachers, reducing them to fees alonel
Many—very many other propositions, the valuable fruit of the
BAILIE’s thrift, have been set forth for the future regulation of the
one school of Glasgow. So that it may reasonably hº hoped, if the
fºr succeed in his reforms, that the free school will, in due season,
be a hall for cobwebs, the schoolmaster giving place to the spider.
Is it not intended to institute public baths in Glasgºw If so, we
would advise Bººne whitehead to take an early dip; and, if
possible, cleanse himself of his present intentions.
-
STATISTICS OF DRUNKENNESS.
A very curious document has been lately drawn up on the origin
causes, results, metaphysics, philosophy, and physiology of drunkenness
one of the most curious chapters is that which contains a table of the
various circumstances to which inebriety may be attributed. The Report
divides intoxication into several heads, including the muzzy, which is a sort
of minor branch. Among the muzzy, six cases ºut of ten may be traced
to spasms, and that one-nineteenth arises from birth-days; that among
confidential clerks inebriety is rare, but when it occurs, pickled salmon,
or the arrival of a friend from the country, are found to be the most
usual eauses of the malady. -
Drunkenness has also been known to arise in some instances from
taking up a bill; but as the latter is an operation which persons given to
intoxication seldom perform, the number of cases to be attributed to
this source is very insignificant. A wife's birth:day has often been known
to lead to a total prostration of the husband; but it is a remarkable fact,
that the day is frequently mistaken in these instances, and such is the
power of imagination, that a man has been known to drop down into the
gutter eight or nine times in a year, through having fancied that the
Éirth-day of his wife occurred repeatedly in the course of a twelvemonth.

THE COMIC BLACKSTONE.
CHAPTER THE TWENTIETH...-OF ALIENATION BY DEVISE.
Aving run through nearly every species
of alienation, we now come to mental
alienation, which is often the accompani-
ment of law, or, at least, the characteristic
of those who rush blindly into it.
Alienation by devise is leaving property
by will, which could not formerly be done;
for, in feudal times, it was not permitted
to a man to have a will of his own—at
least as regarded his real property. By
statutes of Henry the Eighth and of Charles
the Second— who was commonly called
the Merry Monarch, because, as Coke
says, “he was a sadde dogge,”—real pro-
perty was made devisable.
The law of wills was, however, altered
by the 1st Victoria, cap. 26, which facili-
tated the transfer of property, personal,
real, and perhaps sham; for the law loves
to encourage the transmission of property from hand to hand, because,
as valuables are never moved without risk of breakage, so, in the transfer
of property, bits may fall to the lawyers.
A will to pass real or any other kind of property need now be signed
only by the testator and two witnesses, who need not be credible, for the
law will recognise a very bad man as a very good witness.
We shall conclude this Chapter with a few rules for interpreting wills
which have been laid down by the judges, and picked up by those who
heard them.
1st. Wills will be construed to mean what they say, unless they do
not say what they mean, and then the lawyers will go to work to render
confusion worse confounded.
2nd. When the intention is clear, the meaning of the words will be dis-
regarded ; and as the intention can only be gained from the words, the
lawyers again rush in to complicate the matter. False English and bad
Latin will not set aside a will ; so that if a man devises his “worsest
coat,” the legatee will take the oldest coat of the testator; or if the will
specifies a jocularis bona caena to a party of six, it seems that a jolly good
supper would pass by these words to the individuals specified.
3rd. Every part of a will must be supposed to mean something, and
the law, thus tries to put some meaning upon every word, a process
which often ends in making it all amount to nothing.
4th. A will must be construed as unfavourably as possible to the party
making it ; so that if he leaves a peg-top to A. a piece of whip-cord to
spin it with would pass by such a devise, if such a piece of whip-cord
should be in existence.
5th. If the words have two senses—forming, in fact, a pun—the sense
most agreeable to the law will be acted upon ; because it will no doubt be
the most dis-agreeable to every one who has anything to do with the
matter.
6th. When two clauses are repugnant to each other, the last clause is
to stand ; but the clauses leaving property to one, and being, therefore,
repugnant to those who expected the property, are not repugnant clauses
in the sense alluded to.
7th. A will is not void for want of the usual legal phrases; and it is not
therefore necessary for a testator to read up all the old learning on the
subject of “to wit,” “whereas,” “hereinafter,” and the other terms which
constitute the peculiar elegance of legal literature.

The Industrious Fleas were so indisposed last week, that they were
confined for three days to their Witney blanket. NapoleoN is still laid
up with chilblains, owing to the severity of the weather. His Charger,
also, is suffering from weakness in the knees, in consequence of the
slipperiness of the wood pavement of the Pembroke table. They are not
expected to perform again with their usual animation before the return
of the Spring.

T H E (NEXT) * E L A Z E OF TRIUM PH !',
IT is well known that MR. BALFE's Daughter of St. Mark was a
“Blaze of Triumph.” There can be no doubt of it; for Mn. BUNN
has avowed as much in very confident type in all the newspapers.
A blaze of triumph : We can now understand why Fire Offices will
not ensure theatres. With BALFE's operas, too, they are more
than Doubly-hazardous. We are happy to state that the blaze
passed off without doing any mischief. This fortunate event, how-
ever, is mainly attributable to the sagacity of MR. BUNN. He had
made up his mind—had prophesied it to himself—that the opera
should be “a blaze,” and therefore took the precaution to have a fire-
engine ready at every wing. The hose was duly prepared ; and
might in an instant have deluged the whole orchestra, washing {{
Maestro (as the departed JENRINs would have said) Balfe from his
stool. This was perfectly right. The “blaze” originating in the
brain of the composer, it was necessary to be able, at a moment, to
command that; otherwise “the devouring element” might have
produced a general conflagration. Fortunately, the peril is now all
over ; but two or three times the opera was thought to be in great
danger. More than once the firemen were about to play upon
MR, HARR1son, feeling for a moment greatly alarmed by his
shake.
The English, having borrowed nearly all the plays of the French,
also insist upon imitating the French custom of calling for the
author, the composer, the actor, whom they delight to honour. At
times, this mingled condescension and gratitude displays itself in a
most enthusiastic manner, and hence their late calls for manager—
hence did they drag the unwilling BUNN upon the stage, when, like
the celebrated “flower,” he would rather have “blushed unseen *
behind the curtain. Well, after all, too much gratitude from the
public is a sin upon the right side, and we will not check it. On the
contrary, let us endeavour to foster the feeling. Let us hope that the
time will come, when the claims of the orange and apple women of
the front will not be forgotten; that the green-coated, plush-breeched
domestics of the stage, the stage-door keeper, the call-boy, the bill-
stickers to the theatre, the tailors, the sempstresses, the dressers,
in fact, that everybody even in the humblest way connected with
the theatre, will be compelled by a clamorous and admiring public to
enter and receive applause and wreaths for every “blaze” which—
more or less—they may have all helped to stir up.
And a propos of wreaths and bouquets. Why should they not be
sold by the fruit-women; so that impulsive admiration might buy
its sixpenn'orth of homage upon the spot; without being compelled
to purchase it outside the theatre, and then nurse it up for the
enthusiastic moment To return, however, to the “blaze.” Punch
has taken counsel with his artist, who, prophet as he is, thus portrays
the effects of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH*S COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.
LETTER L.-FROM A PUBLISHER TO AN AUTHOR.
Tº lºſſ
º || ||
º
ºrrº-
DEAR SIR,
º Upon my word, this is too bad! We
e have been standing for copy for two days. Really,
tºº too bad. I would not wish to write anything that
might be thought severe; no, I trust I have a
greater respect for letters. Nevertheless, it does
appear to me very strange that gentlemen authors are the only sort
of people with whom there is nothing like regularity. It is never
so with other tradesmen. If I want a coat, or a pair of boots, by a
day—the tailor, the bootmaker never disappoints me: And yet men
who write trill take such liberties 1 as if pen-and-ink gave 'em a sort
of license to do what no respectable tradesman ever thinks of doing.
Business is business all the world over; and there should be the
punctuality in making poems as in making pantaloons. When writers
can't be punctual they ought to give up the trade, and seek other
employment. T - - -
I do not deny that your head may have been a little bit out of
order—that your spirits may have been low or desperate—that all
this beautiful world, as you once very finely said to me, may have
seemed to you as if it was made of wet brown paper. I don't
deny this; but then what have I said to you, again and again?
ought not men who are liable to such ridiculous crotchets, to work
double-tides when they are quite well, so that they may always
have copy in advance of the blue devils? I, sir, who do not pre-
tend to what some folks call the dignity of an author—I have
always been in advance of the world; I have always caught time ºf §
by the forelock in all things. -
Permit me to say, there is a good deal of nonsense talked by you
gentlemen authors—to the great inconvenience of the unfortunate
tradesmen who deal with you—about waiting for inspiration. Pooh 1
It's very like waiting for a policeman when you want him—you
may wait all day, and never light upon him. Inspiration, sir, if you
only persevere, comes with pen-and-ink, in the same way that a
pump that seems dry gives water with pumping.
Again, some of you gentry affect to be affected by the weather—as
if you wrote in quicksilver and not in ink. Docton Johnson, sir,
contained in himself as many people now called authors, as there
are sticks in a faggot. And what says Doctor Johnson about the
effect of season and weather? Why he growls a laugh at it. Yes,
sir, that great man would have written Paradise Lost quite as well in
a coal-mine as in Arcadia, if there is such a place. Besides, when
a man has served his time to writing, it’s after all—I’m sure of it
—nothing more than a knack. Just as a woman knits garters and
gossips at the same time, he can go on writing his book and think
nothing at all about it. This is done every day by some people: I
could only wish, sir, that, with all your talent—for you have a sort of
talent, I don’t deny it—you could do the same thing. It would be
money in your pocket, and a very great convenience to me.
It is true you have written much ; nevertheless, as I say, there is
a good deal of meat upon you yet—a good deal of meat. Some
people may think this a coarse phrase of mine—I don't. . On the
contrary, I think it significant and original. I look upon authors
simply as a butcher looks upon Southdown-mutton; with merely an
eye to the number of pounds to be got out of 'em. You know that
my character is frankness. I have lost a great deal by it—but I
can’t help that.
And now, by ten to-morrow I must have the remainder of this
book. Work—work: you know you can take to your bed, if
necessary, when you have done it. At all events, do the book." And
after all, as somebody says, what is a book but words—and words but
breath Really you must not be after ten to-morrow ; if so, there
are now, thank heaven, twelve posts a day, and I have directed Biggs
to write to you every hour. Yours faithfully,
John CURLL.
LETTER LI. (AND LAST.)
The AUTHOR'S ANSWER,
DEAR SIR,
WITH this, you have the last of the copy. Thank heaven
It is very true, that I have not the punctuality of either your
boot-maker or your tailor; but then I am punished for my iniquity,
for neither have I anything like their banker's account. It is also
the misfortune of my craft to admit not of the services of either
journeymen or 'prentices; otherwise, I too might be very punctual
by the hands of other people.
It is very true that, for the past fortnight, I have had a certain
sickness of the brain, from, I believe, over-work. It is, perhaps, pos-
sible, that even one of your horses if made to carry double might,
for a time, require the repose of the stable. Not that I would think
of comparing my brain to the horse-flesh that calls you master.
Indeed, an author may be rather likened to an elephant, seeing he
frequently has to carry a house upon his back filled with a numerous
family.
You are pleased to say I have a great deal of meat upon me. I
can only say in answer, that it shall be my especial care that, for the
future, none of the said meat shall be transformed into your mutton-
chops.
With this determination, Sir, I remain,
Your obedient Servant,
º, THE switHFIELD cattle show.
---
s UNCH is happy to announce that the Cattle Show
\ has far exceeded in fatness any former
\ years, and the animals have one and all
behaved with a corpulency that does the
highest credit to their heads, hearts, and
5 stomachs.
His Royal Highness PRINCE ALBERT has
come out unusually strong, but his great
force has been in pigs; and he appears to
have thrown his British Farmer's heart into
the pig-pen with an agricultural energy that
others would have done well to imitate. His
Royal Highness was not so great in the ox
line, but he exhibited a pet animal of the
Scotch breed, whose legs were like those of
a foot-stool fastened at the bottom of a large
straw palliasse placed upright, and covered
over with the skins of cattle. The end of the tail had been beautifully
combed out by the perruquier in ordinary to the Royal Cattle, and the
ears had been brushed out very spruce, so that the beast had quite a
foppish look as he peered at the judges through the noose of his hempen
halter.
Some of the short-horned steers seemed not at all to like the impertinent
staring of the Committee appointed to decide on their merits, and a three-
year older, who was ultimately chosen, seemed disposed at one time to
settle the matter by a toss up, while the judges were examining his points
with a view to a decision. Some of PRINCE ALBERT's sheep were the
theme of universal admiration, and a long-woolled wether—the long wool
being very appropriate to this we(a)ther—was loudly cheered as he
tumbled over with an excess of obesity hitherto unparalleled in the annals
of mutton. It was, however, in the pigs that his Royal Highness carried
off the palm, and when his three Bedfordshire pigs waddled into their
pen, the enthusiasm of the public was boundless. These animals seemed
to be fully aware of their Royal ownership, for they attacked some adja-
cent porkers with savage determination, as if to show that they would
bear no rival near the pig-sty.
Nothing, however, that was exhibited at Baker Street Bazaar could
equal Punch's Prize Boar, whose portrait is given in our present number.
He is a superior animal, of a cross Scotch breed, and has been accus-
tomed to the pen from an early period.
