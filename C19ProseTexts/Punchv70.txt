JULY 1, 1876.1
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

rilHICK darkness brooded over the blue waters cf the Bosphorus and Golden Horn, and spread its black pall above the
_L gardens of the Serai' and the dusty waste of the Bezestaii, the domes of Aya-Sofiah, and the crumbling arch of the
Bab-i-Humayun. From the Port of Kara-Keui to the Tepeh-Bashi, the hill-top above the English Embassy, the busy buzz of
life was hushed through the crowded hives of Galata, and the eddiss of traffic crossed and chafed no more in the steep and
stony high street of Pera.
In a word, Stamboul Blept.
But in one inner room of one Konak there were eyes yet open and brains still wide awake. Tnis was in the Inner
Chamber cf the Palace of MIDHAT PASHA, where sat A COUNCIL OF THREE. On the right, in the red fez and blue
surtout of Stamboul officialism, sat MIDHAT; on the left, in the ample green turban, of the Hadji and the flowing robe of
Osmanli orthodoxy, was the SHEIKH-UL-!SLAM; and in the centre, Turk for the nonce as to the outer man, Tartar to those
who might try to catch him, and True Briton, as ever, in heart, the "Pasha-in-Pasha " of endless tales—PORCH!
Yes, I was there—in that pregnant moment big with the future of at least one Turkey, and, probably, several Eagles
—as the Representative of Great Britain, by a warranty over-riding Foreign Office credentials, and with higher than
mere diplomatic functions; the confidant and secretaire intiine of BRITANNIA, the mouthpiece of JOHN BULL.
I had found MJDHAT buried in what, in my playful manner I had ventured to call his " Mid-hat-ations among the
tombc,"—for, indeed, the blood of the wretched ABDUL Aziz was scarce dry on the marble floor of the Cheragan Palace,
and the imperfectly cleansed stains of CAPTAIN HASSAN'S wholesale slaughter were still visible on the pavement and walls of
the Council Chamber in which we sat.
Yes. "Turks " were down with a vengeance! Never did " Bull" under a heavy " contango " work more desperately
for a rise in the market, than did poor MIDHAT, now Master of the Situation—such a situation !—and the SHEIKH-UL-!SLAM
work to get a diplomatic rise out of PONCH!
"La illah Allah illaha, wa Mahmoud rasoul ullah .'" I heard the SHEIKH muttering, as he ran the beads of his chaplet
helplessly through his fingers.
"He means," interposed MIDHAT, with a rather sickly smile, "'there is no power but England, and PUNCH is its pro-
phet;' and you are here for our profit, too," he added, stooping, in his mortal anxiety, to what your dignified Turk rarely
condescends to—a pun. "Say it is so. The English are our friends. Yes—you are going to back us up once more against
those Kaffirs—those dogs, the Russki—as in the old Crimean days? Bono Johnny!"
"Distinguons," I said—it is so hard not to talk French in one's diplomatic moments. "There are ' friends' and
'friends.' Your best' friends,' just now, my dear MIDHAT, and my Venerable SHEIKH, are those, believe me, who will tell
you disagreeable truths"
"All truths are disagreeable," interposed MIDHAT, with a sigh.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"What can a Christian dog know of truth, agreeable or disagreeable?" growled the SHEIKH-UL-!SLAM. "There is no
truth outside of the Koran."
"There it is !" I said, in English, to MIDHAT. "How do you propose to give equal rights to the SULTAN'S subjects,
Christian and Mahometan, under your new Constitution, while you have this orthodox old Gentleman in the green turban to
settle accounts with?" MIDHAT groaned. "We had better come to a clear understanding at once," I continued. "England
is quite disposed to stand between the SULTAN and foul play. We don't mean to allow Russia to take possession of your iron-
clads, or to occupy Turkish waters. That's why BRITANNIA is just now counting her chickens, and their shells, in Besika Bay."
"And the Russkis know it," chuckled MIDHAT. "That's why IQNATIEFF is so civil all of a sudden."
"But we are just as unwilling to stand between Moslem misgovernment and its retribution. We won't help
Russki or Prusski, Austrian or Magyar, Teuton or Slav, to bleed you to death under pretence of breathing a vein, or to
hamstring you on the pretext of giving you a lift out of the ditch; but we don't mean to aid you in putting down
insurrection which is the natural fruit of oppression. If you can't turn your Slaves into subjects, the less you look to us to
help you keep them Slaves the better. If you can trust Osmanli and Christian alike with arms for military service;
if you can restrain both alike from carrying arms in time of peace; if your Cadis can be made to enforce the same law
fairly against both Christian and Moslem; if you can find officials fairly to levy fair taxes on all creeds alike; and Valis
to treat Rayahs with respect, and their women with decency; whether the miracle be wrought by dint of your New Constitu-
tion, or by a new reading of my friend the SHEIKH-UL-ISLAM'S old Koran, then PUNCH will undertake that JOHN BULL will
stand your friend, and that it shall be Bono Johnny again, as in the old Crimean days. But, if not—if the old abominations
are to be perpetuated, with no change but a MOURAD for an ABDUL Aziz—don't trust to England to stand your friend.
All I can promise in that case is that, if it comes to a fight between you and those you are not strong enough to govern
well, but who have grown too strong to be any longer ill-governed as of old, England will see you have a clear field,
and no favour. More than that she won't and can't do"
Aa I spoke, MIDHAT'B face had been growing longer and longer. As for the SHEIKB-UL-ISLAM, I fancy, though
he still kept mechanically fingering his beads, that he must have fallen asleep; at all events, he gave no sign of
understanding. Just then I heard a rustling behind the curtains which veiled a doorway. I recognised the thrilling
frou-frou of feminine garments.
"Ah, ha!" I exclaimed, with a wink at the Minister.
"My hareem!" blushed MIDHAT. "She will do it. The other day I imported a cargo of Western notions for
Office use. A report of the Woman's Rights Association must have been slipped in among them. Ever since she has
led me such a life! The Eastern Question was bad enough, without this worst of Western Questions turning up in
my anderoon."
As he spoke, a mysteriously muffled figure, in feridji and yashmak, stepped majestically from behind the portiere.
Her right hand was raised as in menace; with her left, she laid a rose-tipped finger where the gleam of red lips and white
teeth shone temptingly through the semi-transparent muslin.
The Eastern Question, provocative, veiled, mysterious, seemed suddenly to have taken bodily form, aud to stand
revealed before me.
"Hem !—as 1 said—the Eastern Question,"—faltered MIDHAT, with an uneasy glance at the muffled apparition, and in
a voice in wh'ch marital authority seemed ineffectually struggling to keep up appearances. "May I request you will"
"Pop it?" I exclaimed, gallantly raising to my lips the warm, white fingers of the shrouded odalisque. "By all means
—if you, my poppet, will only be good enough to answer :—but on one condition—that, before I pop that question, you read,
mark, and digest this—to help you to answer it." So saying, and dexterously contriving to catch hold of the veiled Beauty's
hand under her feridji, I slipped into it—my SEVENTIETH VOLUME!

PUNCH'S ALMANACK FOB 1876.

RANDOM RECOLLECTIONS OF GREAT MEN.
IT is not generally known that the Poet Laureate is
liable to painful attacks of doubt and hesitation. Not
long ago ne went into the shop of MESSRS. PIESSE AND
LUHIN, and, after chatting with the two eminent Per-
fumers for some time, looked sadly at them, shook his
head, and saying,
"1 know not which is sweeter I No ! not I '"
sighed, and left the shop.
Mn. BASS, as he one day escorted Mus. HEMANS over
liis brewery at .Burton, expressed in warm terms his
admiration of her poetry, and told her how much he
coveted her power of giving pleasure to thousands.
The Poetess laughed at his enthusiasm. "Your suc-
cess is greater than mine," she said, "for
"Earth's noblest sons thy bitter cup hare ah:iroJ."
POPE was very much attached to LOUD ELCHO, and
was accustomed, in familiar conversation, to call him
"Honest-Instinct." Being asked by LORD RANELAGH
to explain this singular appellation, POPE replied,
"You would not ask such a question had you read my
Essay on Mini, but would remember
"How Hottest I nst in •! comes, a Volunteer
bure never to o'ershoot, but just tj hit."
SIR JOHN LUMBOCK was surprised one day at meet-
ing THOMSON in Threadneedle Street, and asked him,
in much astonishment, what had brought him into the
City. The Poet of The Seasons pointed to a number of
grev-headcd old gentlemen, who were walking briskly
in tile same direction, and said, archly, u This U Divi-
dend day, and
"1 seek the Bank where flowery elders crowj."
The same Poet, hearing HEKR DANNREUTHKK praise
the works of WAGNER the Composer, asked what WAG-
NER had written'; and, on being told that his music
was called "The Mitsie of t/ie future" replied, "Yes,
yes; I understand! We had such music in the Castle
of Indolence. It was
"A certain music never known before."
BOSWELL one day told DR. JOHNSON that the REVE-
REND JOHN MACAULAY, in his History of (it. Kiidn,
had stated us n well-authenticated fact that, whenever

not to suppose that there is anything singular in that:
it only shows that the islanders prefer the stranger's
rheum to his company."
During the recent severe frost, the RIGHT HONOUH-
AIILE JOSEPH ADDISON went into the office of the
Spectator, in Wellington Street, and asked for a little
brandv and a clothes' brush, giving as a reason for this
singular request, that he had just had a severe fall oil
a slide. Tne Kditor, who did not quite comprehend
the exclamation, exclaimed hastily, "When did you
fall ?"—" O!" replied the great moralist, " it was
"Wlien in the slippery paths of youth
With heedless tt-'ps 1 nm."
"How is it that you always get an invitation to the
Guildhall dinner on the ninth of November?" said Silt
JULES BENEDICT to MR. ARTHUR SULLIVAN. "I
don't exactly know," was the reply; "but I think that
I must owe it to my connection with Booney's Ainiiiaf."
HORACE and MJBCBNA8 were walking down the
Strand sue day last Spring, just as a great crowd of
ladies was pouring out of Exeter Hall. "What is all
this aboittr" said M/KCESA8. "Don't you know?"
said HORACE. lijain verts comite.s. This is the time

Society." Lived sumptuously upon the subscriptions.
November, — The subscribers of “ The Deceased
Mariners' Aid Society" asking disagreeable questions,
entered the Merchant Service on this occasion with
all my wits about me.
December.-Assisted in putting my Captain in irons,
and kept Christmas merrily by breaking into the spirit
cupboard and going to the bottom. Not being born to
be drowned, picked up and brought to England. Ended
the year in the parlour of a sea-side tavern, in a happy

When the water nearly freezes.

Go, glide o'er the mimic “Rink,"
And sing, "What a day for skating !'

July.—Starvation. Went back into the Union, and
resumed my old work.
August.—Came out of "the House," and went back

(Being a leaf out of our Almanack for Hit Ttar 10TC.)
Foil the instruction of posterity, and in order to pre-
serve some record of the way in which we live now, we
chronicle a few of the remarkable events which have
occurred in the past twelvemonth :—
l\'fir Year'* Day.—Opening of New London Bridge,
built in order to relieve the growing traffic of the City,
mid extending in unbroken width from Westminster to
Wnpping.
.S7. Valentine's Da;/.—Xo fewer than five million
four thousand and twentv-scvcn Valentines were re-
ceived and delivered by the patent postal telegraphic
lightning apparatus, within the radius of the Metropolis
before six o'clock, A.M.
Nl. Patrick's Day.—Inaugiiration of the Submarine
Railway from Holvhead to Kingstown. Grand break-
fist in honour of the visit of the LOUD MAYOII OF
LONDON, given by the Corporation, in the Phn.-nix
Park, and banquet in the evening to tho MAYOR OF
DVBLIX, who returned with his Lordship by express
train to the Mansion-Heine.
All Fools' Day.—A report pained credence at the
Clubs, and thence was wafted to the Vatican by private
wire from Westminster, that BISHOP BHOADciit'BCH
had been preaching in Mil. STCRGKON'H tabernacle, and
thence returned to Lambeth Palace on the knifeboard
of an omnibus.
Lady Day.—The House of Ladies was opened for the
Session by the SPEAKERESS in person, who announced
in her Speech that the stringent Act of Parliament
which the House had passed last autumn, extending
the rights of nvirricd women to the privilege of latch-
keys, had been ihreatencd with repeal by the Oppo-
sition in the House of Lords.
3fay Day.—Banquet given to the President and
Members of the Itoyal Academy, to celebrate the fiftieth
anniversary of Iho'niaking of the law which prohibits
the U.A.'s from hanging their own pictures; a task
which is performed now with far greater success by a
Committee of outsiders.
Waterloo Day.—Great excitement was caused in
certain fashionable circles by a letter in the Times from
the COUNTESS OF Coi.NEY HATCH, complaining that
her Cook, though paid a salary of £-500 a-vcar, insisted
upon having her own tea imported overland through
Russia, and, besides receiving the usual bonnet-money
and culinary perquisites, demanded to be found in
Derby Day.—The annual contest of Aerial Veloci~
pcdes was flown on the new course from Birmingham
to Bayswater, and resulted in a dead heat between
LORD HEI.TER SKELTER's Tearaway and CAPTAIN
STIRRUP'S High Stejiprr, the nice occupying tweuty-
Beveu minutes three seconds and a half cxactlv.
Jllitlfiiuimcr Day.—Fancy undress ball and breakfast

MAHCK, the President of Prussia.

sion from the Opera, for having dragged her worscr
half on a round ot morning calls.
Lord Mayor's Day.— Having been unanimously
elected to the onerous o« well as honourable office of
Lord Mayor of this immense Metropolis (which now
covers the whole country from Bedford to Brighton,
and from Salisbury to Soutliend), Mr. I'lindi presided
at the banquet, which, as usual, was held in the Guild-
hall, and was honoured by the presence of the Sove-
reigns of Europe, together wilh the British Governor
of China, the KINO OK CALIFORNIA, and the EMPRESS
OF THE SOUTHERN DISUNITED STATES.
King's Birthday.—Grand review of our Steam Sol-
diers upon Canterbury Common, in honour of the visit
of the EMPKROR av AUSTRALIA. Upwards of a mil-
lion of Mechanical Troopa were mustered to march p ist,
and the charge of the Steam Cavalrv was described as
something wonderful. When the Emperor left the
field, a battery of " Woolwich Babies" (each a thirty
thousand pounder) opened tire in a salute, which was
distinctly heard at the Land's End and John o'Groat's
House.
DIARIES FOR THE YEAR.
THE TAILOR.
January.—Moved up to London from the country
with my wife anil children.
1'cliruary.—Obtained employment in :» West End
establishment, and curried favour with my master's
customers.
March.—Got access to the books of the firm, nnd
made copious extracts therefrom.
April.—Became a widower, and married my master's
daughter.
May.—Explained to my father-in-law that he was
ring to the extracts I had made from the journal and
the ledger. My father-in-law angry, but powerless.
Became his partner.
June.—Very busy with legal proceedings against the
less important customers of the firm. Constant com-
munication kept up between our Solicitors and the
official representatives of the Sheriffs of London and
Middlesex.
July.—Enjoyed a tour on the Continent. Travelled
strictly incognito iinder the nomine (fc voyage of "LE
BARON UE SMITH, Grand Milor' Anglais."
August. — Back to business. Recommenced legal
Sroceedings, and called in all the debts of the firm,
uined the establishment, and divided the profits.
Father-in-law retired to Clapham.
Septtmlier.—Started business on mv own account in
the premises lately occupied bv my father-in-law and
myself. Invented tho Royal Khiva Ovircjat. Got the
garment made by the machine girls for next to nothing,
and advertised it largely. Spent a great part of the
month in shooting over my new preserves in Sussex.
Octolirr.—Explained to the important customers of
the late firm that my then partner (my father-in-law)
was responsible for commencing legal proceedings against
any gentleman of higher rank than a baronet. Upon
this, important customers returned to my books by the
score, and unimportant customers (following the lead
of their betters) by the thousand.
Jforemlici:—Commenced to accommodate my cus-
tomers. Lent money at eighty-five per cent, to these
(if them who could give me proper security. Found
this venture oven a better thing than the sale of "the
Royal Khiva Overcoat, as advertised."

Half-a-dozen decoys bringing mo customers (each with
two good names) daily. Nothing could be better.
Ended the year by eating my plum-pudding off silver
plate, and marrying my daughter (by my first wife) to
a parson!
A TREE OF WOE.—The common Yew (Tnnia bae-
tain), as an ornament of the churchyard, has acquired
melancholy associations. No wonder, considering its
botanical name, Taxus.

the season?

THE CYNIC S CALENDAH.
(Melancholy Hems, on the Hitcritt a} tin J/uiilA.)
OCTOBER,
CHILL October, month unpleasant!
Now gun-maniacs pot the pheasant.
Leaves are falling, fields are damp,
Can't go out without a Gamp.
All the Cackle family out,
Primed to prose and prompt to spout.
Zeal at zemth, nous at zero,
Season to trot out a Hero.
Money spent and temper flown,
Think" of coining back to town.
Silly season! Sense that's sober
Shuns the precincts of October.
NOVEMUER.
NEXT November. Eugh! its presence
Brings black misery in quintessence.
Sky a pall, and earth a. bog,
Intermediate region—fog!
Egypt's darkness could uc felt,
Ours is worse, it may be smelt!
Who to peace may make pretences,
Suffering through all his senses?
Fog, big feeds, Guys, rows, and rockets,
Plague ears, eyes, nose, stomach, pockets.
Fawkcs I 'd gratefully remember
Had he blown away—November!
DECEMHEH.
DREAR December cuds the dozen.
One day flooded, next one frozen!
Christmas, falsely called the jolly,
Saturnalia of folly.
Gush, dyspepsia, decoration,
Shillingsworth's of stale sensation,
Parcel-plague.—things known as " presents,"-
Wines none want, superfluous pheasants.
Exit old year! Crowning bother,
With next day begins another!
Bills, bad weather, bones,—remember
Don't depart with dead December!
LOOKING VP OUR HISTORY.—How few of those who
admire the roof of Westminster Hall remember that the
original Hall was built by WILLIAM AVFCS!
SEPTEMBER 29. —Michaelmas Day. Roman Capitol
saved by geese. English Capital lost by ditto.
DIARIES FOR TH >. YEAR,
THE THIEF.
January.—Having nothing better to do, started a
Bank. Christened it the Royal English, Welsh, Irish,
and Scottish Banking Association. Appointed agents
in all the principal towns in the United Kingdom and
the colonies. Agents' premium, £100.
February.— The Bank having failed, turned my atten-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A LA MODE DE FRANCE.
As Englishmen are very prone to envy the advantages of their
neighbours, Mr. Punch begs to present the nation with a picture of
the House of Commons as it would become were it conducted a la
mode de Versailles :—
Lower House, Feb., 187—.
The SPEAKER, amidst general reclamations from all sides of the
Chamber, took his seat at four o'clock.
Immediately after prayers (which were much interrupted by
noises from the Left), seven Members sprang to their feet together.
The Speaker. I must proclaim order. (Cheers from the Right.)
Order is the language of Rule. Without Rule there is no true
liberty. (Loud protests from the Left.) MR. BROWN is in pos-
session of the House. I implore MR. BROWN to remember that he is
an Englishman.
Mr. Sroten. The SPEAKER tells me I am an Englishman, and I
tell him he is another. (Laughter.)
The Speaker. The House knows that threats arc powerless to
influence me. (Cheers from the Right.) And the House shall now
learn that ridicule, the heritage of tools (protests from the Left, and ,
interruption)—I repeat, ridicule, the heritage of fools (renewed
interruption, and Hear! hear!" from the Right) is equally
powerless.
Mr. Brown. I move that the Earlv Closing Bill be read a Third
Time, and pass. It has been read a i'irst and Second Time without
provoking a discussion.
Mr. Smith. There was once a grandmother who lived in
Putney
Mr. Sroten. We do not want history.
Mr. Smith. No, you do not—neither you nor your party. (Loud
cheers from the Right, and great excitement amongst the Left.)
Your party has made History a record of blood and shame. (Frantic
excitement on the Left.)
The Speaker. I must call MH. SMITH to order. The dignity of
this House will not permit such a statement to go forth. The history
of the greatest nation on the earth (cheering on the Right), the home
of civilisation (cheering on the Left), and the pride of the ocean
(general cheering)—in fact, England (tumultuous applause in all
parts of the Chamber) cannot be described as "a record of blood and
shame." (" JVb, no.'")
Mr. Smith. I do not speak of History, but of a Grandmother.
(Loud laughter.) This Grandmother lived at Putney, and was very
stupid. (Protests from the Left.) She had a Grandson, and he
was called MR. BROWN. (Frantic excitement amongst the Member*
of tlte Left, who shake their fists at MR. SMITH.}
Mr. Brown. An insult is only damaging when it emanates from
a worthy man. MR. SMITH is not a worthy man. (Shouts of
applause from the Left.)
The Speaker. I cannot permit such a discussion. I call both the
Members who have just spoken to order. (Protests from all sides of
the House.) We must not forget that if we all of us have, or have
had, Grandmothers, most of us will have Grandsons; and those
Grandsons will be Englishmen. (" Hear.' hear ! "from the Right f
and protests from the Left.)
Mr. Robinson. I tell the SPEAKER deliberately that he insults
posterity. (Immense tumult, shouts and shrieks from Right and
Left, and " Hear ! hear .'"from the Cross Benches.)
The Speaker. Were I not here to preserve decorum and peace,.
I would strike MR. ROBINSON to the ground!
Mr. Robinson (rising). I am waiting for the blow. (Excitement.)
The Speaker. I shall wait until you leave this chamber. If von
fall here, you will fall on honourable ground. The proper place
for the slanderer is the gutter. (Loud and prolonged sensa-
tion.)
Mr. Robinson. Posterity will avenge me. •
Mr. Brown. Then posterity will not have much to avenge.
(Laughter.)
The Speaker. I call MR. BROWN to order. This House is not the
place for recrimination. (Cheering from all parts of the Chamber.)
Mr. Tompkins. And vet MR. BROWN sometimes rides in a
Brompton and Islington Omnibus. (Protests from the Left, and
"It is true.'" from the Right.)
Mr. Brown. A sneer can be endured when the sneerer neglects to
pav his butcher's book! (Great excitement below the Gangway.)
Mr. Tompkins. This is not the first time that I have been
slandered. I demand that my Butcher be called to the Bar of this
House to be questioned. (Loud Laughter from the Left.)
The Speaker. MR. TOMPKINS is within his rights. As Speaker of
this House. I command that all business be suspended until the
Butcher of MR. TOMPKINS has been examined. (" Well done .'"from
below the Gangway.)
Mr. Smith. Then jour command will not be obeyed. (Immense
cheering from the Right.)
The Speaker. To endure is to be noble, but nobility has its limits.
I am here to preserve order, but when my authority is questioned I
can only do one thing. I can only take off my wig I (Immense

excitement. Scores of Members rush up to the Chair to dissuade
the Speaker from carrying out his intention.) Gentlemen, my
mind is made up, but before I go I would ask, is there any Act that
requires passing ?>t^*s?
Mr. Broicn. The Early Closing Bill requires passing.
The Early Closing Bill (which provides that every Englishman
shall keep within the limits of his own premises between the hours
of five P.M. and seven A.M.) was then read a Third Time, and passed
without provoking any further discussion.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
(Containing some Account of the Chapter of the Star, and how it
was managed, with much novel information, and many interesting
detail*.)
AB Sru,
0 WHAT a day wi;
arehaving in India! Never.
•were .such times! I am
bursting with news, over-
flowing witih intelligence
— as I always am—even
you, Sir, must admit that
—and I scarcely know
where to commence. Shall
I tell you about Ceylon?
or, us I said to my Amiable
and Illustrious Friend,
"shall I take this seal off
my lips to tell him about
this Ceylon?"
My Gifted Companion
did not see this joke at
first; but when ie did,
nothing save my own in-
llexilile patriotism could
hare _ prevented him from
creating me a Peer on the
spot. But I wouldn't have
it; because, on return-
ing home, it would be
such a bore 'to keep •np.
"The Jew wouldn't lie worth the scandal," as somebody said.
'Well, 'Sir, shall it be of Ceylon, or of Kandy — sweet Kandy P.
As I remarked to my Royal Co-Explorer, "If I speak of sweet
Kandy, I must be candid." "That joke" my Illustrious
and 'Intelligent Friend returned, "ought to be preserved."
"O pickles! I replied, sharp as a knife, cm the instant; for I was
not to be outdone, even though Royalty, like Femininalitiy, ought
to be allowed the last word to the end or the chapter. Chapter!—
that's it! I '11 begin with that; i.e. with some account of the Chapter
of the Stars of India, which my Condescending and most Illustrious
Leader held the other day at Calcutta. Its success—and it was a
success—was mainly owing to the admirable forethought of Yours,
Truly; for in these matters the ordinary Staff are nowhere,—in-
cluding LOBDS C-GT-N, B-B-F-D, and the DUKE OF S-TH-RL-in),—
who is what the Australians call a" damper "—which is aflat cake—
where a feu dejoie is concerned. But, though I say it, who, perhaps,
should not, when there is a real difficulty," Je suts-tout Id," and my
motto is, as my amusing Friend, the BABOIT DE LESSEPB used to say-
to the KHEDIVE, "Nil(e) desperonditm!" Mais, qu'il etait drote,
ce cher LESSEES!
Well, Sir, when the notion was first started, my preface to this
first Chapter was the following suggestion:—"Sir, these Rajahs,
Maharajans, Jamjams, Jellybhoys, and other Princes, will come in
such gorgeous costumes, that we, in merely our European .uniforms,
will be nowhere: we shall be worse than insignificant, and the
British Rule in India will be imperilled." A shadow passed
across the open brow—(it is becoming more and more open every-
day)—of my Exalted Friend. The Staff were mute.
"What, then," he asked, "do you propose?" ^
"Sir," I replied, "simply this: ME. CHAKLESMATHEWS is coming
out to Calcutta. Let us telegraph to him to call-at 8.'MAY'S, the1
Theatrical Costumier's, in Bow -Street, and before that estimable
person is too busy with his Christmas Pantomimes to attend to us.,
let us have all the most resplendent costumes that his wardrobe, and
my experience, can supply." 'Bien, tres bien, from ,the left. Joy
was restored to every countenance.
"I.playcd Aladdtn'when I was at the University," suddenly cried
out LOKD C-R-GT-N, with all the'gusto of a young Polonius, recall-
ing his performance of Caesar. It was »a magnificent dress! 'I'll
send for that!1'
It was arranged. I made out the list, arid before the Veteran
Comedian left England he had received'his Secret Instructions. 'Not
a word of this has been breathed till n<fw. I made out the list, and
when we arrived at Calcutta we found the boxes awaiting us, with
the following dresses carefully packed, arranged, and labelled:
One Sardanapalus, with sword complete. One Richard Coeur dc
Lion, with fiat King John Helmet. One Captain Crosstree, with
extra largo silver epaulettes, and double-sized cocked-hat. One
Richard the Third, with boots, sword, and crown. Box and Cox,
one of each, with three hats for Cox. One King of the Peacocks.
Two Sprites, spangled tights. Three Brigands, with russet boots,
belt, pistols, and combat swords complete. N.B.—Swords, if not
wanted, to be returned at once. Harlequin's Dress, Clown's and
Pantaloon's ditto, brand new, with Red Hot Poker lent for the occa-
sion, with MR. CHATTKBTON'S compliments, only -used in last year's
Pantomime, and to be returned immediately if not required.
Banners, with emblematic devices worked on one side only. N.B.
Care must be taken in carrying to keep this side constantly facing
the audience. One Doge of Venice (by kind permission of Mi. anil
MRS. BANCROFT, who have no further use for it. N.B.—Can be
bought a bargain). One Dancing Jiarber in satin, -with trick tails to
work. One llepnistopheles, with a Faust disguise cloak and second
dress to match. Six Pairs of Fleshings, in case they might be
wanted. Five Petticoat Trousers for Smugglers, Red Rovers, and
Black Wills. One Clanearty. one Buckingham (complete). Alad-
din's Uncle. Two Big Heads tor Courtiers, not required in the
Covent Garden Pantomime, with MB. RICE'S best regards. One
Earl of Leicester (Kenilworth). One Henry the Eighth (with jewels).
One Shah (with plumes and scimitar). Two Guests (Noblemen), in
Lttcrexia liorgia. Ditto, Monks in Pavorita. Full Suit of Armour,
with white tunic, as worn by Jean in Le Prophete. And, in case
of accidents, one Mr. Golightlv, in Lewi Me Fine Shillings, and
one Sprigging in Ici on Parle franqais. OneOsrick. One Tyrolean
Peasant, and one Jeremy Diddlcr, and a Harlequin. One Miles
na Cqppaleen. One Venetian Nobleman, and one Swell in a Pan-
tomime, with Dundreary Coat in canary yellow. Wigs, by MR.
CiiABKSOif, the Theatrical Perruquicr, to match, including one Red
Scratch, one Brutus, one Trick Wig, one Light Sparse, two Scalps,
three Short Blue Crops, and a Middle-Aged Eccentric.
Here was a choice! Here was, as we say in India, a Caste.'
Lords C. and B. had a tremendous row as to which should be Cox
and which Sox. But I stopped that, and locked away the farce
dresses and the Big Heads in my bedroom. I was so afraid that if
they had been worn, some religious prejudices of the lower orders
might have been offended. As for myself, I simply came out as
the Earl of Leicester, rand carried the Red Hot Poker, for I
couldn't intrust it to any of the younger members of the Staff,
who might have been inclined to upset everybody by playing the
fool with HOTRRAO DADO, of Outdore, or old RAJAH STTTMJAKJ who
has the very deuce of a temper, and is a thorough martinet in all
matters of Court ceremony. My Illustrious Friend put himself
in my hands, and the effect of a mixture, admirably -selected,
of Aladdin, King of the Peacocks, Richard the Third's Crown,
and Manrioo's White Cloak (from Trovatore, you remember f), was
simply magnificent.
He was followed by .two Cavalier Pages with ringlet wigs, and
preceded, as I have already intimated, by myself as Earl of
Leicester, bearing the H«d Hot Poker. A thrill of envy ran
through the brilliant throng as we strode towards the Dais. SIB
AuGwrrs BALAX .Ttwo and SIB JAK HOLKAE—the Holkar, as he
is called here — burst out into involuntary applause, which,
however, at a hint from me (with the Poker), was immediately
suppressed. The extra costumes, such as Box and Cox, Golighrtly,
the Brigands, and so forth, which we couldn't use, I let out
to some of the smaller swells at so much an hour; but I had
a great deal of trouble in getting them back, and more trouble
in collaring the ready cash. The stout little RAJAH OF POJJYPORE
had got into the Harlequin's Dress—Heaven knows how!—and
as we couldn't get him out of it, except by cutting it off him, he
was .compelled to buy it. He gave me two lakhs of rupees down
on the nail, and I left him inside the dress. He will have to wait
till he is thinner to get out of it again. He-thought himself no end
of a swell, but as he could move neither hand or foot, he had to be
carried by eight Bungalows (i. e. a kind of Yeomen of the Guard) *
who supported him during the ceremony.
In the evening we had a little music with SING RTTMTUM TIDDI -
SHOT and DOKEM IFAK DEEP, accompanied by the GUITAB and
Sra BASSOOX HOBHOT. Then the MAHARAJAH OF Pirns AH (a-regular
old Indian JOE MILLER, and rather & bore after a quarter-of-an-
hour.of him), dropped in with a fanny story to tell us. But for-
tunately the BOSHAR OF POOHPOONAH, was present, who knows all
the Maharajah's jokes by heart, and shuts him up without cere-
mony; so we were spared that infliction, ano>iinished a merry and
exciting day with a quiet Indian rubberit

PUNCH, Ofi THE, LONDON CHAEIVARI.
Next day we held a. private encampment of our own; and created
two of the suite Knights of By-George and By-Jingo.
My Illustrious'and- Musical^Friend has taken it into his head to
learn, the Tom-Tom. A native Professor from. Banjppore comes
every morning and evenings. I hsveTtatrtested against th& lessons
being given .after I am in bed,, and. before I awake. If this course
of instruction is persisted in, my Royal Companion witt lose a
trusted and valuable servant. Should you sec me at your office
sooner than you had expected, do not question me: merely hand
me tie cheque due ,—you will know why I have returned.
On Saturday we had a visit from RAJAH BUKDLAE SEGAB SMOKAB,
of the Baccs district. He is of a rich brown colour, very strong,
and, by the way, draws admirably. He came in his steam-yacht,
which, is commanded by his Admiral, EIHZAH BACCA STOPAK, who
was presented: to us in the course of the- afternoon. We sat round
the Jlookam (or. Royal Tent of'purple silk), taking our usual re-
freshment at five oclock, slaking our thirst with iced Jhool and
pounded Jemadar, with a small slice of Goru—a kind of pickled
Jungle salmon, which would scarcely bear exportation.*
Yesterdar we visited several manufactures. Among other
curiosities I took my Illustrious and Noble Companion to see the
machinery employed in extracting the cocoa-nut juke. My Intel-
ligent and Boyal Friend was much struck on my pointing out how
the ultimate object of this process accounted for the peculiarity of
the presence of the milk within the oocoa-nut, though it'appears
that, even in our advanced stage.of civilisation, we are as far as ever
from the solution of the problem suggested to all thoughtful minds
by the presence of the hair outside.
Our, prospective arrangements are thus, subject to alteration. Two
days' elephant shooting, and other sport, with NAWAB GsruHirr
BAXGrSinJTAB; a Banquet given by the Indian Legal Luminaries;
with, SIB. JAX "Flor.KAU, the Holkar, in the chair; a Ball chez the
BEGUM OF POLKAK; two days to change cheques, en route,
nt Bankipore in Cashmere; then on a Mission of Peace to the
HAJAH Mcsr HAVA. Row and RAJAH URAB NUTHEB, who have deter-
mined to accept, the decision of our Royal Solomon.
You 'mill be glad to hear that the Gold Umbrella has been found,
at* least, the ticket has, with the name of Sierra on it. The Native
Police have traced it as far as Pawnee. I do not attribute any imv
portance to the faet (which will soon be made public), in connection'
with thisi strange umbrella episode, that LOBD NOHTHBHOOK will
retire in-fovour of but no, I couldn't undertake it, or it would

liave already seen in most of the daily papers full and detailed accounts of
this striking; ceremonial, which, to a certain extent, differs from that of our
esteemed Correnpnndcnt. We have not yet had' time to call and verity the
facts at the Costumier's in Bow Street, but we shall, and for the satisfaction
of our readen we will add that if we do not find the above information cor-
roborated, we shall pay another viitt in Bow Street, and ask the- sitting
Magistrate's advice. We are not to be trifled with, and, by the wav, it is now

will pleaie accept this intimation.—Ki>.
• We have had recourse to our old Dictionary. Somebody's wrong some-
where. We find that Jlookam, which our Correspondent describes as "a
Boyal Tent,',' is " an order or command." Jhool is " an elephant's housings,"
and'/Maxtor is "a Sepoy sergeant." "We merely point out the impossibility
of slaking one's-thirst with "iced elephant's housings, and pounded Sepoy
Sergeant." Yet—a* there are two sides to every question—what would an
Indian say if In; heard, of our drinking " cobbler," and looked ouf that word
in a Dictionary? Perhaps Jhool and Jemadarmay be slang names of Indian
drinks-, and tliis hypothesis would suffice to explain "a small slice of Goru,"
Gent being, in our- Dictionary," a teacher or priest," One thing wet do not
understand, and that u Our Correspondent's description of Goru &i " Jungle
Salmon." Surely, surely, there an: no salmon in a J angle! Wo spaak under
correction, never having been ourselves in India, yet we must confess we

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 15, 1876.
1
A CATECHISER CATECHISED.
Ms, PUNCH has had the pain of perusing certain extracts, in the
form of question and answer, declared to be taken from a little
book, entitled, Some Question! of the Church Catechism and the
Doctrines Invoiced briefly Explained, for the Use of Families and
Parochial Schools. Mr. Punch would fain helieve this agreeable
compilation to be
apocryphal, and
hopes to find its
principles generally
repudiated. The
spirit which it mani-
fests, however, is
only too palpable a
sign of the times.
The extracts made
public have special
reference to those
sinful and idolatrous
heretics, "who go by
the general name of
Dissenters." In the
view of the author of
this work, that gene-
ral name would ap-
pear to be a mere
alias of Antichrist.
The bearers of it are
explicitly said to
"Worship God ac-
cording to their own
evil and corrupt ima-
ginations, and not
according to His re-
vealed Will, and,
therefore, their wor-
ship is idolatrous."
Dissent is declared
to be "agreat sin,"
the sharers in which
are only saved from
i'x communication by
the culpable laxity
of the law of the land
»s opposed to that of
the Church. To enter
'' a Meeting House"
at all is affirmed to
be "wicked," and
the Quotation of
Church prayers by
Dissenting teachers
is denounced sinful
and presumptuous.
Mr. Punch is lost
in admiration at this
outburst of clerical
Common Sense, and
Charity. Admira-
tion naturally moves
to emulation, and he
is impelled to try his
hand at catechetical
composition. He
flares hardly hope
that, with his lay-
man's pen, he may
compete in charity
of spirit or in co-
gency of argument
with his clerical ex-
emplars ; but mind-
ful of the maxim,
that imitation is the
sincerest form of
Hattery, he hopes, by
framing his on their —
Own lines, to conciliate the compilers of this catechetical
to be delivered from the sins of 'envy, hatred, and all uncharitable-
ness.'
"Q. Is. then, their form of worship a reasonable Service?
"A. No, because they worship according to their own fantastic
imaginations, strenuously denying to others the right to adopt a
simpler and more serious ceremonial; and, therefore, neither the
form nor the spirit of their worship can be said to be in accord with
sober sense or good
feeling.
"Q. Is Ritualism
Emngeliiw (as the Offertory bag is coming round).
THE QUEEN
'Short
Way with Dissenters."
"Q. We have amongst us certain Dissenters from the accepted and
Established Church Customs of the Country, who go by the general
name of Ritualists. In what light are we to consider them?
"A. People of sense prefer to consider them as little as possible.
Too many of them are vindictive, vainglorious, vituperative, and in
our Litany we expressly pray, as strangely enough do they in theirs,
I' 'I sreat'folly?
"A. Yes; it is in
direct opposition to
our duty towards
our neighbour.
"Q. How comes it
then, in the present
day, that, in some
quar t er s, it is
thought so highly of''
"A. Partly from
ignoranceof its great
absurdity, partly
from men and
women being more
zealous for forms,
fashions, finery, and
the indulgence of
their own fancies,
than for serious, ami
sometimes, arduous,
spiritual realities.
"Q. But why have
Ritualists not been
excommunicated'?
"A. Because the
wholesome law of
the land does not
allow the will of
ecclesiastical zealots
to be acted upon:
but many Ritualists
have virtually ex-
communicateJthem-
selves (or, in other
words, sent them-
selves to a sort of
clerical Coventry),
by setting up a
standard of act and
speech which is
aohorrent to all per-
sons possessed of
courtesy, candour,
and Chri s t ia u
charity."
Mr. Punch does
not venture to follow
his pricstlv pioneers
further, having a
dread of presumptu-
ous profanity, which
they do not appear
to share. For ex-
ample, he hesitates
to declare, ex cathi--
dnij that the most
rabid Ritualist is
"not in a state of
salvation," to rigor-
ously limit the use
of any prayer to
priestly lips, or to
pronounce it wick-
ed, though he may
think it unprofit-
able, to enter at all
one of those places
where "Mass in masquerade" is most elaborately "performed. But
he would call the attention of the compilers of the Brief Explanation,
to the fatal facility with which the catechetical form of dogmatism,
may be turned to what they would doubtless consider base uses; and
would invite a reconsideration on the part of all reasonable Ritualists,
of the policy which finds issue in such impotent outbursts of malig-
nant bigotry as this Anti-Christian Catechism "for the use of
Parishes and Parochial Schools!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ON THE OLD WAYS.
(By an Ancient and Quiet Churchman.)
"There is a remarkable instance of longevity
at present among the officials at the parish church
of Kirkburton, Yorkshire. The vioar, the REV.
R. COLLINS, M.A., is in his eighty-second year,
and has been officiating there for a period of
thirty-eight years; the parish clerk, MR. I. FIT-
TON, is in his seventy-fifth year, and has occupied
his position also for thirty-eight years; the sexton,
JOHN AKMITAGE, is eighty-four years of age; and
the verger, JAMES HOTLB, is in his seventy-sixth
year. Their united ages are 316 years, giving an
average of seventy-nine years. They are all in
good health except the sexton, whose duties are
performed by his sou. The schoolmaster, MB. A.
HARGREAVES, who was teacher at the Church
Schools, died a few weeks ago, aged seventy-eight
years."
WHAT a long-lived parish
Must Kirkburtpn be!
Instances are rarish
Of such longevity.
In rhyme 'tis hard to state years;
^ But there's the Viear, who,
Serving thirty-eight years,
Has reached Eighty-Two!
Parish Clerk is younger;
Still he is alive,
With a healthy hunger
For fees at (seventy-Five.
Sexton chants a merry hymn,
Though it be a bore.
Some boy must some day bury him—
He's only Eighty-Four!
Verger keeps in order
Schoolboys at their tricks,
Close on Fourscore's border—•
Being Seventy-Six.
Schoolmaster has yielded
His ferule up to Fate,
Sceptre having wielded
Up to Seventy-Eight.
Verger who has listened
Threescore years and ten
To Vicar while he christened
Babies, now old men!
Parish quite ideal
Ruled by elders sage!
Can the tale be real
In this headlong age?
When these ancients travel
To another sphere.
Mysteries to unravel
Which perplex us hero,
Should the ruling prelate
Let Kirkburton go
To a heady zealot,
High of Church, or Low!
Full of bile and bitter hate,
Breathing brawl and breeze,
Some raw semi-literate
Buzzer of St. Bees
Pace grows quick and quicker,
OlJways youth eschew,
But give me the old Vicar,
Hale at Eighty-Two!

SHORT COMMONS FOR SOLDIERS.
PKTJDBNT MK. Pmrcn,
WE must not be too lavish. Sir—" Equi etpoctee aletidi, non
aginandi sunt. The rule prescribed by CHAKLEMAGNE for horses
and poets has been in part at least persistently applied to the
Sritieh Army with tho best results. Our private Soldiers, happily
or ourselves, Jare not fattened. Certain grumblers say they are
jnly.half-fed. , Because Civilians about Christmas are accustomed
o eat ajuttle more meat than is good for them, this is the time that
las been'chosen by/Gentlemen discontented with the diet of others
o. complain that boldiers do not get food enough. They oome out
with Christmas Appeals on behalf of the Army.
The REV. *H. P. WEIGHT, Chaplain to the Forces, states in the
Times one of the Soldier's many grievances, which in the aggregate
ecount'for continual desertion, to be insufficiency of food—his
laijy ration of meat in particular falling short of a pound.
DB. FABQTTHAESON, late Assistant Surgeon, Coldstream Guards,
oes not scruple to endorse this statement, not only urging that the
len ought to be allowed more, but also declaring that the Army
Medical Department " have for many years pressed on the Govern-
ment the necessity of making some increase in the Soldier's ration."
He even adds :—
"In the re^merot to which I had formerly the honour to belon" this point
was always insisted upon in our Annual Report; and SIR GALBKAITH LOOAN
endeavoured vainly to induce the Authorities to consent to add another
quarter of a pound of meat to the daily allowance."
DR. FAROT-HABSOJT pays a compliment as merited as undesigned to
the cml Authorities who so long and steadily resisted even pro-
fessional solicitations to relax their system of military 'economy
Perhaps he expects to seduce a Conservative Government from the
path of parsimony pursued by their Liberal predecessors. He
appeabj to their softer feelings in the name of Temperance with the
following rhetoric :—
werememb"r that our troops have nothing to eat between their
dinner and next day's breakfast, except a cup of coffee and a bit of dry
oread, we can understand the craving for stimulants and tobacco which
usually exists, «nd the evil effects produced by adulterated public-house
liquor taken on what is popularly called an empty stomach."
If the craving for stimulants and tobacco could he repressed bv
recurrence to Hogging in the Army for drunkenness, the evil effects
produced by adulterated public-house liquor taken on what is popu-
larly called an empty stomach would be -very much minimised and
a hundred lashes, or so, would be vastly cheaper than the allowance
of an additional quarter of a pound of meat per man per day or
even of an 'evening meal which might be supplemented in various
ways up to the nutritive value of another quarter of a pound of
animal food, " as DE. FAHQUHAHSON insidiously suggests with a
feigned deference to official frugality. DR. FARQTJHABSON is pre-
sumably a Scotchman, and ought to be ashamed of himself.
That the^ British Soldier's courage requires to be maintained with
animal food is an antiquated idea. The Constable of France in
Henry F., says of the English—" And then give them great meals
ot beef, and iron, and steel, and they will eat like wolves, and fight
like devils" To which Orleans replies-" Ay, but these English
are shrewdly out of beef." So they were. Nevertheless they fought
and conquered at Agincourt.
Everybody knows that foxhounds have to be dieted considerably
below the degree which would appease their hunger. It is neces-
sary to keep them reasonably lean. That is also precisely the
rationale ot the Soldier's rations. When the kennel or the barrack
s mutinous— apply the lash.
It may be objected that perseverance, with a view to keep down
the Estimates, m keeping the Soldier on short commons, diminishes
enlistment at a rate whicli threatens soon to leave us with an in-
adequate Army. Well, then we can acquiesce in the Admiralty
Circular, and make such other concessions regarding the " Comity
}f Nations." that we shall never find ourselves in want of any con-
iderable Army, if of any Army at all. Or we can ultimately have
recourse to Conscription, when we needs must. In the meanwhile
we can wait till then, and save our pockets, and not suffer our
enjoyment of four meals a day, including jive o'clock tea, to be dis-
turbed by Christmas Appeals, demanding for the men who tight
ur battles a whole quarter of a pound of meat more per diem from
he country, and the

DISINTERESTED DRAMATISTS.

MONO the letters from distin-
guished living dramatists (in-
cluding one in which the author
modestly veils himself under
the name of his creation) re-
ceived by MR. DISRAELI since
the publication of that written
by the accomplished Author of
1 he Shaughraun, we select the
following:—
The Duke's Theatre, HoUwrn.
SIR,
DURING the last nine
years, on and off (I have, per-
haps, been rather more "on"
than off), we have been repre-
senting before the English
people in London and the pro-
vinces a most pathetic play, entitled Slack Eyed Susan, to whicn is
ay,
title,
appended a secondary 'title, The Little Bill that teas Taken Up.
To commence, let me disclaim for the author all idea that "The
Little Bill" bears any resemblance to the great Liberal ex-Leader,
"The People's WILLIAM." No, Sir, our William is indeed the most
popular Bill that has ever been introduced into the House under any
Ministry.
As a literary effort, the work has a merit peculiarly its own. As
for its poetic clothing, I can only refer you to the songs of " Pretty
See-usan, don't say no," "Susan make Emm for your Uncle," and
"Captain Crosstree is my name." The encores that have invariably
followed these morceaux must not be taken as evidences of any
violent political excitement. It is the simple story of a young
English Sailor assaulting an inebriated Naval Officer, being tried,
convicted, and eventually restored to freedom by a pardon granted,
at my intercession, under the LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S Licence, during
your tenure of office as First Lord of the Treasury.
I call to witness twelve million of the English people who have
paid their money to witness this representation (and I shall be happy
to call as many more on the same terms).—and I call to witness the
enormous Free List entirely suspended—I call to witness the Public
Press, most justly excepted,—and I call the whole World to witness
this spectacle (it wouhlbe a big House if they all came on one night,
—ana I may add that this " Spectacle," whicn I call upon the whole
World to witness, does not depend solely and only on spectacular
effects, though we do fire a gun from a man-of-war, and there are
two " working figures" in a rowing-boat—a most moving sight),—I
say I call on The Whole World, ay, and his wife (children under
twelve half price to all parts except the gallery), to witness this
spectacle—the Government of England, with a full and noble
reliance on the loyalty of the English people, authorising, and
approving, through its officer the LORD CHAMBERLAIN, the perform-
ance of this play, in which a gallant Naval Officer (myself) is repre-
sented as getting most unwarrantably intoxicated, and, while in that state, acting in a manner unworthy of a British Tar, by laying
hands on a female in distress, and being, thereupon, cut down by an A.B. Sailor, who is forthwith tried by an incompetent and muddle-
headed Court Martial, thus inviting, nightly, a Jury of the Entire Population of London to come, if they can, and pronounce their
feelings not only on a great social, but also on a great political, and vitally national question.
In all countries, from the time of Noah's Ark to the present day, the Theatre has been acknowledged a sensitive test of public opinion
on Naval affairs. It was, surely, not the cunning of the dramatist (it might have been his craft, as some of the action is on board ship),

norlthe great merit of the actors (of one in particular, whose name
my native modesty will not allow to pass these lips), that lifted the
roof off several theatres where this play has been performed, that
caused the audience to shout with frantic delight, wave their hand-
kerchiefs and hats, throw bouquets to me, Sir, and compel the actors
to repeat one song and dance six times, and another twice, nightly,
and that cheer after cheer rang through the house when, freely in-
viting contradiction, I asserted that Captain Crosstree was my name?
Surely there is no attempt throughout the play to palliate the
offence of a Naval Officer allowing himself to be disguised in liquor?
Why do the spectators watch with interest my progress across the
stage, my necktie disarranged, my hair unkempt, as 1 endeavour to
place a bottle carefully on the table? Are they actuated by their
love for the bottle, or their regard for me? And, when an announce-
ment is made by Captain Crosstree (myself), at the end of the piece,
to the effect, that having taken the pledge, I am wearing a medal
given me by SIE WILFBID LAWSON, why are these words greeted
with hearty applause? May we answer: it is 1te.cau.tc the great
English people have begun to forgive the offence which they have no
desire to forget t The question has been asked, nearly seven
hundred times in London alone, of millions of people of all classes,
and has been answered from the PRINCE and PRINCESS of WALES,
the QUEEN of DENMARK, the PRINCESS THYRA (in a private box), and
their respective suites (in the stalls), down to, or. rather, up to, the
humblest mechanic in the sixpenny gallery, without one. dissentient
voice. No, Sir, out of all this vast multitude not one single soul has
risen in his place to assert that Captain Crosstree is not my name. I
have delayed calling your attention to this matter until this moment,
when,we are on the eve of playing the piece for the seven hundredth
timci and no charge for booking.
I am no engineer, Sir, any more than you are, but if I venture
out of my mental depth, it is to ask you to request Mr. W. H. to go
down in a diving-bell and raise the Vanguard, then repair the
errors of recent Naval Court Martials, and the injuries of the Iron
Di&e, and, finally recall the Second Slave Circular.
Then, Sir, and not till then, will I cease to assert before a loyal
and generous public that, with all respect to you, Sir, my name is—
Aboard H.M.S. P&Uy Pternus. CAPTAIN CKOSSTHKB, K.N.
SlE,
WE have produced a Play of which the universe has now
heard much. We have called it All for Her; but believe us, Sir,
when we say that we have had no other wish in producing it than
that, of assisting the ill-used publican. It is AH for Him that we
have now at the present moment some three thousand reformed
drunkards hammering at the Pit-door. To you. Sir, the first Dra-
matist in the world—for such assuredly you would be if you turned
your magnificent talent* to writing for the Stage—to you, Sir, we
appeal on behalf of our ill-used countrymen. Why should the
public-house bo closed at half-past twelve, now there arc no more
inebriates in our nobla city?
Put on the clock, Sir, to two A.M., and the millions of Londoners
who have flooded our boxes and stalls with their tears will bless
the Authors of All for Her.
We have the honour to remain,
P. S. ATO H. M.
Sm,
To you, the brightest Star on that Stage which is the World, I
address myself, as I would have you believe that I love my country
every bit as much as Ma. BorrciCAUlT.
I have just withdrawn for ever my historical Play of Buckingham.

LOUD MAYOR downwards, declared nightly for the space—well, for
a considerable period—their faith in the dynasty of the STTTAKTS.
To you, Sir, the only poet of our epoch, I proudly point as the man
who has it in his power to remove the reigning House from the
Throae and so do tardy justice to the Irish branch of the STUARTS,
which the voices of a million admirers have elected to the Throne of
England. For this I have struggled; for this I penned my Charles
the First: for this I ran down CEOMWF.H,, and threw the halo of a
chaste but ardent imagination around BITCKTCGHAM. That play will
never appear again; but my convictions will remain the same until
I lose my head as the mot COUEEpS did before me.
I am writing another piece in honour of the STUATITS, for which
all the stalls and bexes are retained for one hundred nig-hts in
advance.
I have the honour to remain

For over three hundred nights the Fjiglish people have
witnessed at this theatre a play called Our Soys. In that play two
young, men endeavour to earn their living by the literary craft,
wherein you are the most distinguished living adept. They
starve, Sir—they are rescued,—they are amply provided for, and
cheer after cheer shakes the walls of the theatre. Sir, there are
many young men in London in a similar predicament. Rescue
these struggling authors, provide them with pensions, and your

TRIAL by Jury is received nightly with great applause. If
we were asked what it is that evokes the generous enthusiasm of
the audience,'we should answer, that it is the fact that the Judge
nobly marries the Plaintiff in a Breach of Promise suit. Make this
a law, Sir! In future, compel all judges in this class of cases to
marry the Plaintiffs, and high as is the esteem in which you are now

never be allowed to make the acquaintance of our sisters, our

hat falsest of friends, Madam Fashion. And what has Madam
fashion done for her votaries? Little good and much bad. It was
jy the command of tliis hardest of task-mistresses that maidens
issumed robes of arsenic green, and robbed the poor little Dicky
iirds of their pretty plumage. It was by her command that hoops,
dyes, and false hair were rummaged out of the lumber-rooms of
;he Past to figure once again in the drawing-rooms of the Present.
Contempt follows close upon disgust when it is found that Madam
Fashion is not only cruel but stupid. The poison of the arsenic
might have been condoned had the colour of its green been becom-
ng. Rink hats and dolls' bonnets might be tolerated were they only
iretty. But neither the dve nor the head-dress could show the
lall-mark of good-taste. The mysterious is closely allied to the

Nothing is prettier than a sweet face peeping out of a becoming

friends to make Madam Fashion their slave in lien of their

warm bonnets—which maybe made eminently becoming—instead of
the tasteless and useless abominations which now usurp the name.
They will find the change, they may take Mr. Punch's word for it,
not only better for their health, but (what is far more important in
their eyes), decidedly conducive to their attractiveness.

INSTRUCTION FOR THE UNIVERSE.
OST PROPOUND
MR. PCSCH,
You had better
look to your laurels,
as the reporters say.
There exists an Uni-
versal Oracle else-
where, Sir, than at
«.">, Fleet Street.
Above another portal
than your offioe-
door it may now be
written:—
"Hie stupor est niundi
qui scibilc disL'Utit
omne."
Moreover that other
Astonishment of fche
World knows all he
talks about, as well
as you 4o. Omni-
science, said to have
been the late DR.
WHEWELL'S foible,
is another's forte,
as well as yours.
Who is that other?
You are told in the following paragraph of news, if truly
reported :—
"CARDINAL MANSINC, last night opened the Academin of the Catholic
religion in Manchester. The object of this institution is to promote the study
of tie Roman Catholic religion, to oppose the errors of the day, to preserve
the young from the influence of such errors, and to provide lectures on literary,
historical, and scientific subjects in connection with Catholicism. In the
course of the proceedings the Cardinal delivered an address, in which he
maintained that the Catholic Church is the true exponent of revelation,
science, history, politics, and morals."
Of course, Mr. PuncJi, this Oracle has always been at the service
of Christendom, though nobody knew that till 1870, when the Vati-
can Council declared^ the POPE infallible. The Universal Oracle
has always existed at Rome in the form of the Pope for the time
being. Inere Infallibility and Holiness combined have ever, from
the pontificate of St. Peter downwards, impersonated the Infallible
Church—infallible in its dogmas not only dcfidis et moribus, but also
ili- rebus cunctis et quiimsdam aliis.
Sow, thanks to the electric telegraph, for the invention of which,
primarily, mankind are indebted to the only true exponent (besides
yourself) of all science and all truth, whether sacred or secular, the
Oracle of Rome has branch Oracles in sundry places, notably at
Manchester, where CARDINAL MANNING opened the Academia, and
in Westminster, where he resides. The ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY
can grant degrees, but is not supposed to pretend to know, for
instance, how far a recipient is qualified for tno diploma of Doctor of
Medicine. There the ARCHBISHOP OF WESTMINSTER has the advan-
tage of him, through connection of the local with the central Oracle.
Unluckily, any degrees he might be authorised to confer would
perhaps not be recognised by the Medical Council. It is deplorable
that bigotry should impede the rapid advancement in scientific
Medicine, Physiology^ Chemistry, and all the collateral sciences,
which would necessarily result from due concession to an infallibly
true exponent of science, no less than of revelation, history, polities,
ami morals.
The true exposition of History, Mr. Punch, you will allow, is
conditional on the true exposition of Science. The former and the
hitter taken together will set the stury of GALILEO, for instance, in
the right light; and demonstrate that astronomical truth, like all
other, originated from Rome.
Now that the Ao.ide.mia of the Catholic Religion is established at
Manchester, PROFESSOBS TTSTDAU, and HUXLEY, MB. DARWIH, and
all the rest of our naturalists and philosophers, had better go there
to school. So had MR.. CAEI.YLK, who is not too old to learn; so had
ME. FROUDF,, so had every other historian; so had both MR. GLAD-
STONE and MB. DISRAELI—especially MR. GLADSTONE; so had all
politicians; so had every moralist—except you.
Perhaps no long time will elapse before roe Catholic Aqademia of
Manchester shall have published a Catholic Encyclopedia for our
instruction in nil things, particularly on the subjects of the Begin-
ning of life, I ii vi-lopment, and Orisrin of Species, the Age of Man-
kind, the Antiquity of the World, the Functions of the Brain, and
Physiology and Geology at large. In this publication we may also
expect tout tlir true exponent of History will unfold the annals of
Chemistry, Klectrieity, Steam, and Mechanics, and show that the
modern .great conquests <if Nature bv means of Science were mac of
them the exploits of Protestant PETESTIXYS, DAVYS, FASARAYS,
WATTS, STEPH i:xsoxs, WHKATSTONKS or any heretics whomsoever,
but all so many victories won by soldiers of the Faith. And ««rely
the compilers of this useful volume will, while they are about it,
not forget to prove (by infallible assertion) that the initiative «f all
great moral reforms, which have elevated humanity, signally that
of the Abolition of Slavery and the Slave Trade wns taken by the
one true exponent of everything that is good, either in an Allocu-
tion, or an Encyclical, or a Brief, if not a Bull. Infallibility cannot
conflict with infallibility, otherwise, Sir, yon might perhaps be
pleased to consider whether you had not better be beforehand with
its other Claimants in bringing out a Dictionary of Uuivernal Truth,
for the diffusion of knowledge and enlightenment, and the aoeeler-
ation of l'i;o<; RKSS.

Blunders—of course. Would the Nation ene Party in power

'Tis blunders bring healthy rotation of crops on the Treasury Bench.
But are there no questions that burn on next Session's liberal list,
That yon, sharp-sighted KIR VERSON, come out us a Negativist P
True, better aught than maintain Mob for king with his toadies and

And with husks for good grain fob off the hunger of fools,
Y'et 'twere well to protest against telling tie world to stand still;
Of eloquence where is the test like fruit of work with a will?

U-ril to the Continent. Spciiks four I'mgunges. Understands hunting
things.
A useful servant this, no doubt; but, with a view to on engage-
ment, he might be more explicit. For instance, why does he not
name the languages he speaks? Suppose ho is a Welshman, and is
conversant with Hindostanee, Hebrew, and Chinese; his knowledge
of four languages would really be remarkable, though not pecu-
liarly serviceable in Continental travel. Then again, what are the
"things" which he understands hunting P Are they rats and mice,
and such small deer; or elephants and tigers, and other nobler
animals? Or can he be conveying a delicate allusion tothe"things"
which are unnameablc, but which are so commonly hunted after
nightfall by tourists on the Continent, and indee'd are too well
known to need more identification?

enough to ask the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF to step this way.

Great Military Reformer (reading text-book). "In 1874 the Mar-
tini-Henry superseded the Snider Rifle." Yes. that 's all right. I
have got one of each. Stupid people, why didn t they label them!
[Continues his examination of the fire-arms.
Enter the
Commander-in- Chief. I think you sent for me?
Great Military Reformer. 0 yes. I want to discuss the Mobili-
sation of the Army Scheme with your Royal Highness. But, before
we begin, will your Royal Highness kindly tell me which of these
two rifles is the Martini-Henry and which is the Snider.
Commander-in- Chief. Certainly. This (pointing to one of the
rifles) is the Martini-Henry, and that (pointing to the other) is the
Snider.
Great Military Reformer. 0 thank you BO much! You see I
have promised to deliver a lecture at Sheffield this evening on
"Modern Fire-arms — their History and Manufacture," and I like to
be accurate. And now may I beg your Royal Highness to be seated.
Commander-in- Chief. Thank you, Sir, I prefer to stand.
Great Military Reformer. As I am about to give you a short
account of some of my Reforms, I really think you had better take a
chair. Well, then, Your Royal Highness, since I have had the
honour of being Secretary of State for War I have made several
alterations in the Army.
Commander-in-Chief. So I have been told byjall^the Officers
Commanding Districts.
Great Military Reformer. Ah, you must not listen to them. You
must know that I have had to interfere with some of them con-
siderably.
Commander-in-Chief. Quite so. The Inspector-General of
Recruiting informs me that his office is now a sinecure.
Great Military Reformer. Well, certainly, we do not get quite so
many men under the new system as we did under the old, but que
ronlez-votis?—a sacrifice must be made somewhere.
Commandcr-in- Chief. Pardon me if I am wrong, but I was under
the impression that you came to the War Office to increase our
Army, not to cause it to fall off in numbers.
Great Military Reformer. Your Royal Highness is perfectly
right, but remeniber 1 am feeling my way. I have several systems
at work in different parts of the country. For instance, at Sheffield
(thanks to the Act passed last Session, giving me unlimited powers),
I am carrying out the Prussian plan. I make service compulsory,
and the saving in the pay of the soldier is something enormous.
Enter PRIVATE SECRETARY, with a letter.
Private Secretary. This has just come by the country post, Sir.
Great Military Reformer. Thank you. (Takes the letter, and
reads it. His face folk. To Secretary, angrily.) Really, MR.
TKOTOFOTTR, I wish you would not interrupt me when I am
discussing matters of national importance. You can go, Sir.
[Exit Private Secretary.
Commander-in-Chief. No bad news, I trust?
Great Military Reformer. O, nothing very serious. The Sheffield
manufacturers refuse to undertake a contract I offered to them.
They declare that, since Compulsory Service has been in force,
the labour market has been drained, and trade has gone to rack
and ruin. So silly of them! If they are ruined, it will increase the
work at the Bankruptcy Court. So what is bad for them will be good
for the lawyers. It will be only carrying money into another branch
of industry.—To continue: At Dublin I nave abolished the Army in
favour of the Militia. We do not want two distinct forces to defend

Really, MK. "TEXTOFOUK, I think I said I did not wish to be
disturbed?
Private Secretary. Very sorry, Sir, but I think the matter must
be important.
Great Military Reformer. Give it me. (Takes telegram, reads it.
and makes a grimace. After a long pause.) I really think you had
better tell COLONEL HEKDEBSON to order the A Division of Police to
hold themselves in readiness for immediate embarkation.
[Exit Private Secretary, hurriedly.
Commanfler-in-Chief. Nothing wrong, I hope?
Great Military Reformer. Well, it is annoying. The fact is, the
Militia Regiment stationed in Dublin has mutinied.
Commander-in-Chief. Dear me! Very strange! The Miittia
used.to be a very loyal force. Excellent raw material, and capital
officers.
Great.'Military Reformer. Yes; but, you see, I dismissed the
officers, and don t quite know how to deal with the raw material.
But it will be all right when the Police arrive.—To continue : In
Scotland I have abolished the Militia in favour of the Army.
(Enter Private Secretary.) Really, Ma. TEHTOFOUH, this repeated
intrusion is absolutely indecent.
Private Secretory. I am very sorry, Sir, but they say they won't
go away until they have seen you.

Have you made them put down the purpose of their visit in

Private Secretary. Yes, Sir. (Reading from paper.) "To invite
tke SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR to restore the ancient Scottish
Militia instantly, or to discuss the matter with them after the
fashion of their Highland ancestors."
Great Military Reformer. 0 this is most irregular!
Private Secretary. So I said, Sir. But I can do nothing with
them. The LAIRD OF CRAIGIE Busy has got an immense two-
handed sword and [Loud noise heard without.

Great Military Reformer. Thank you. Will you kindly telegraph
to Sheffield to say that I shall be unable to deliver my lecture this
evening. Good morning, Your Royal Highness.
Commaiukr-in-Chief. But I thought, Sir, that you wished to
discuss the Mobilisation Scheme of the Army with me.

"OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.
(Why we Didn't See Bangalore—The True.""'Reason—A Grand
Affair—An Evtmng with a Cheetah.)
EE best-laid plans, dear Sir,
will mis-carry. I had got
up, privately, and, as a
matter of personal spec., a
first-rate reception tor my
Illustrious Friend at Ban-
galore. My Royal and
Respected Companion had
expressed his intention of
doing Bangalore. Banga-
lore has not been'done, but
/ have. I had engaged all
the best Eastern Swells,
troupes of Nautch Girls.
Jugglers, fireworks, and all
sorts of games, regardless
of expense, and you can't
do these things for nothing.
You can't get a genuine
Rajah and suite for one
night under a lakh, and, if
they aren't paid, they have
their knife into you, lite-
rally. However, I didn't
make the engagements,
luckily, myself, out put the
whole show into the hands
of a Native Entrepreneur,
the SIB SOUTHTJEE SORDAR-
BHOY. who can smooth over
a difficulty with his com-
patriots, where I should
only get deeper into the
mire. The feature of the
show was a Bevy of the Beauties of Bangalore forming a Royal
Arch, and the loveliest of their sex advancing in line and sing-
ing, "Let me Kiss him for his Mother." The RAJAH MnraiTl
KBI.SMAKSTRE would have held aloft an artificial bunch of Mis-
tletoe, and the ceremony, to Native music, would have been carried
out in -detail. The only person in the secret was my dear
friend theJ.Assistant-Secretary, who, at the last moment, rushed
in to mo with a telegram from England, dated Scotland, to this
effect:—
"•Meeting of Anglo-Christian Union. Row about H.R.R's
doings. DR. Duff's speech. Nautch girls not respectable.
Advisers of Prince to be censured. Parliamentary proceedings,
Old Bailey, Netrgate, threatened. British Throne in danger.
Drop animal fghts, idols, and Nautches. More Parsons, less

Parsees. Look out for your Sal-morals. WUat on earth in
DUCKWORTH about?
Signed D—s OF J5—irs—an."*
There was no help for it. My Royal Friend was indignant at
first, but he soon recovered his spirits, and pointed out that, in any
o»*>, all the blame would fall on me and the Assistant Secretary, and
than, in his clear, ringing voice, my Gay and Noble Companion sang
out I never go East of Bangalore," which was immediately taken
up by the Suite, Lords C—GT—N and B—SK—n leading, and after a
short dance, we sat down, laughing, but exhausted. It is the only
approach to a. fiasco that has happened since we 've been out here on
the tour with the Star of India.
CoLONBt HOGG invited us to some pig-sticking, but you 'vc had
enough of that. My Illustrious Co-Sportsman speared all the pigs
bar one, for I could not stand it any longer, but stepping forward,
exclaimed,—
"Woodman, spare that pig!"
and he did. That was the only incident.t
We had another good day in the preserves of His Highness, MEKR
GREEK'SAJEE, Jam of Larstere, and in the evening we were invited
to the Tayku Mandoum Club by SIR ROWJEE FUSSYBHOY, who must
have his nngcr in every pie. There was to be a great reception, and
I managed to fetch some of my other Native swells from Bangalore just
in time. This was the order of the Procession, which was, by a great
way, the most characteristic thing that's been done as yet:—
The GRAND ZIND AVEHTA
(carrying a cushion which he could sit down upon when he was tired—I found
I must give him something to hold, as he was so awkward with his hands).
The DJUVAII OF PZXKUMHI. Hia Excellency TUPPKSOJEE BVBKADDI.
His Highness KHANJEE BUTTEE WONTJBE,
Nawab of Jogalongo (mounted).
SIR SQUEJEME TOAJELLYBHOY HOHAMED MEEIILI ALI
(attended bv four Nautch (The Native Historian, attended
Girls). by Secretaries).
An Elephant, painted Green and Red, with
.Fireworks on his Tusks and Tail.
Jugglers Snake Charmers Jugglers
(doing tricks with Knives), (with real Snakes). (swallowing Swords).
* We are not quite able to reeonri/f the dates. Snoh a meeting, under the
presidency of DR. DUVP, was held in Edinburgh, nnd reported in the Daily
Telegraph only last week; but how could Our Correspondent have received
the news in time to write and send an account of it to England? On second
thoughts, perhaps, the fiijfffrtnce in clocks between England and India might
account for it; or, he may be alluding to some previous meeting of a similar
character. We confess we are not prepared to dismiss :iu old and valued
Correspondent merely for a difference in clocks.—ED.
t In a recent telegram, we find "The Prince spared one pig." This, to
our mind, spoke volumes for the veracity of our Correspondent. On our
calling at the office of the journal in which the telegram appeared, we usriT-
tained that "spared" was a printer's error for "speared.' But, still, it
shows that Our Representative must have been on the spot, which is, in fact,
the only thing we have ever had any doubt about during his correspon-
dence.—ED.

The people of Singleloo were delighted, as the whole affair was

gave us an excellent dinner at the Club; and my Gorgeous and
Hearty Friend ate fifty-two curries, three dozen mangoes, and drank
half-a-dozen bottles of fine old Shuter-suttoar* and so did I.
I regret that the evening did not end so pleasantly. I must
unwillingly record a scandal. But it is better for you to have the
true version of it through me, than to trust to vague telegrams,
rumours, and unauthentic dispatches.
We sat down after dinner not to our rubber, but to ecartf, with
two strangers, apparently native swells. One was introduced as

suddenly seized the CHEETAH by the. throat, shook his sleeve, and out

his face became three shades paler, and he leapt out of the window

As for the CHEETAH, his pockets were emptied, and he was kicked
out of the Club by a herculean young Gentleman, ME. H. ARDASSAR
NAYLEBEE, who sent him flying into the moonlight. I was afraid
tha,t there would have been a free fight, as the CHEETAH had his

whose friendly disposition towards the English residents is so well
known as to have passed into a proverb.
The Old Rajah had but to clap his hands, and his band of'Native
BOKSARS would have rushed in and cleared the room in a second.
The Rajah, who is a sort of Unpaid Magistrate, told us that if the
CHEETAH was brought before nim, he should order him to receive
twenty krakhs (blows on the head), thirty bakwakhs (lashes, but not
necessarily on the head), and be fined seventy lakhs. Knowing that
the CHEETAH might be still about, I trembled, for the Gold Umbrella,
which, for a second time, had been thoughtlessly left by SIR JAK
HOI.KA it—the Holkar—in the Hall.
However, it was safe. I am glad this Gold Umbrella has been
found—but, if LORD NORTHBROOK has retired, he has not been
recalled. J remain in haste, your truthful

AN EPICURE’S EXPOSTULATION.
“I conclude that the best diet, the one best adapted to the
human constitution, and to sustain the highest vigour of body
and mind, is one composed of bread and fruit. By bread I mean
all the grains, placing wheat at their head, and including pota-
toes, yams, and the like, for the cooked potato is an inferior sort
of bread, so is the chestnut. With bread and fruit as pivots, we
may take milk and eggs simply, or in combination, as in cakes
and puddings, or milk in its forms of cream, butter, and cheese.

SINCE the production of MB. GILBERT'S Broken Hearts so much
ultra-sentimentality has found a vent in Belgravia, that the following
sad cases of incipient insanity have been registered by the medical
gentlemen whose fashionable Victorias may be seen any day
careering wildly down Grosvenor Place:—
LADY THEODOSIA SPINDLESHANKS, impressed too vividly with the
beautiful idea of a sympathetic exchange of affection with inanimate
objects, has set up a large sable muff in her boudoir, which she
declares reminds her but too dearly of her faithle_ss CHARLEY in the
Blues. Alas, poor muff! he is warm-hearted, it is true, but cannot
squeeze her hands as her dear one did. LADY THEODOSIA burns two
candles (long fours) continually before it. She is at present occupied
in embroidering a cover for her pet muff.
THE HONOURABLE MAEIA FBJSKYFOOT sees no one. Her many
admirers (she is a widow, and rich) have all to leave their cards anil
turn awav, unblessed with a sight of her, from her doors. She has
devoted all her ardent affection to the adoration of a spoon, silver, it
is true, bearing an ancient coat of many quartcrmgs, but still
undeniably a spoon. The HONOURABLE MARIA has been heard to
declare that the soul of that barbarous baronet, SIR PAUL FITZPOODLE,
hangs about that silver semblance;—SIR PAUL, who swore to marry
her when she became a widow, and who long ago consoled himself
with a wealthy Manchester manufacturer's daughter and heiress.
In vain she presses that spoon to her lips; there is as yet no
response from the cold metal, no sign of emotion in those armorial
bearings: still she will love it with all the ardour of a fading beauty,
and never, never, no, never, will she cast her eyes on that spoon
without recalling her cruel PAUL.
Miss ETHEL DE NIGAUD, the lovely and accomplished daughter of
an old Norman House, has left London and retired to the family
mansion in Shropshire, where there is no one but the Housekeeper
and Gardeners to interfere with her infatuation. Every morning
she decorates with holly and ivy, and such hot-house flowers as can
be obtained, the fine old Pump standing in the stable-vard. She is
convinced that a magnetic chord exists, connecting this relic with
the Member for , to whom she was devoted, and from whom she
expected a proposal of marriage all last season. That Pump is the
object of her worship, and the recalcitrant M.P. little thinks what
image reproduces him to the mind of the little ETHEL he was proud
to flirt with in Society.
We believe that the accomplished author of Broken Hearts is
responsible for all these aberrations of intellect, and we beg of him
to consider under what a fearful weight of responsibility he exercises
his great powers of imagination and invention.

0,1 say Punch, old fellow, here's a jolly bit of news:—
"FAIRS, who is pronounced to be incomparably the beet racquet-player of

So you see that racquet play now ranks among the Arts, and
FAIRS may style himself M.A. like any other Eton master. I wonder
now if other public schools will follow in the fashion. Harrow ought
to start a Master of the noble Art of Cricket, and Rugby might set
up a Master of the Art of Football. Degrees might be conferred for
prowess in such Arts; and the initials M.A.If. and M.A.F.G. might

GUARD!
THE following: communica-
tions, headed "The Brigade
of Guards," and apparently
intended for the columns
of a respected contem-
porary, have recently fonnd
their way into Mr, Punch's
Letter Box:—
January 22, 187G.
8m,
I AM proud to say
I belong to the old school,
and hate your new-fangled
notions about 'humanity,
kindness, and the rest of
it. Why should not the
Guards take their "Sentry
go" with the rest of the
Service? The Duke, Sir,
would never have permitted
men to shirk their duty.
By degrees we are losing
everything. Stocks, and
the fine old regulation
knapsack, are already
things of the past, anot,
doubtless, before my name
is erased from the Army
List, the ohaoo (spell itthat
way, Sir, vide the Quern's
Regulations) will also kave
ceased to exist.
Remember, Sir, that Soldiers are not Boarding-School Miises.
They should be tough and hardy, and ready to go anywhere and
everywhere at a moment's notice. Night sentry duty, indeed! Why
not? Remember Waterloo and the Peninsula. Take my advioe,
Sir. Give the Guards lots of night sentry work. Yes, and let 'ein
do it without their great coats.
You may ask me if I have ever done anything of the sort myself.
The question is impertinent, but I answer you. No, Sir, I have not.
I am a General Officer, Sir, and have spent the greater part of my
life at Bath and Cheltenham. There, Sir!
Yours, indignantly,
The Pump Room. RETIRED HALF-PAY.
gm January 22, 1876.
IN these days of progress we cannot pay any attention to
the old-fashioned traditions of the past. Oi course, I know that
history (a subject I had to "take up many, many months ago) records
the glorious doings of our Army when it was ill fed, ill clothed, and
(from an educational point of view) badly officered. But then our
victories were won when an ensign scarcely knew the difference
between an angle and an angel. In my opinion, night sentry
duty is utterly useless. Were the sentry-boxes -fitted up as studies,
or lavatories, the case would be different. If a Private could devote
a few hours of the ni^ht to reading chemistry, and tie higher
branches of mathematics, I would be the very last man in the
world to say him nay; but merely to march up and down a beaten
path without purpose and vaguely is quite repugnant to oommon
sense. I am well aware that the General Officer commanding the
district in which my regiment is stationed disagrees with my con-
clusions ; but then, although his experience may be somewhat larger
than mine, I do not think he could compete with me, with any
pros_pect of success, in an examination carried on with a view to
testing our respective knowledge of Hebrew, Greek, and modern
languages.
I may say, I have devoted a considerable portion of my life to an
analysis of this important question. I-^-but here I am obliged to
break off, as the Adjutant has just conveyed to me the commands of
my Colonel to immediately present myself in the barrack square for
the purpose of acquiring some knowledge of a rather difficult
military manoeuvre. I allude to the exercise called, in civilian
circles, "the Goose Step."
I have the honour to be., Sir.
Yours, very faithfully,

and the New Junior University Club.
g[R January 22, 1876.
I AM quite afraid to write to yon! And I would not see
my name in the papers for worlds! But, then, I do so like the
Officers that I cannot help feeling some sympathy for the Men. I
know I am very silly, but I do think that night sentry duty is
wrong. Of course, in the day time, there should be Soldiers at the
gates of Marlborough House to salute the Prince and the dear
Princess, and the darling Royal Children. If there were hot, how
could they turn out the Guard, or whatever it is, when a Royal
carriage passes V But at night no one can see the sentries, and they
are therefore useless—now are they not f I am sure the dear
Princess can care very little for all this State on her return from a
ball or the opera. I know / don't care a bit for the coachman's
touch of the hat when / get out of the carriage at two o'clock in the
morning. Of course the Guard being turned out is much nicer and
grander, but, then, what is the use of it if you can't see it?
I think, unless the sentries can be lighted up with the lime-light,
or something of that sort, at night, they ought to be discontinued.
Don't you f

NIGHT sentry dutv is a decided mistake. It makes our men
discontented, and sends them into the hospital. Give them three
extra meals of meat a day, and let them have one hundred and
fifteen extra reading-rooms, and the Brigade will never be at a loss
for recruits.
I have the honour to be, Sir, yours obediently,

gIE January 22, 1876.
NroHT sentry duty is an excellent thing. It makes our men
heroes, and is an admirable remedy for coughs and colds. Give
them rather less food and close the exercise-destroying reading-
rooms, and the Brigade will never be at a loss for recruits.
I have the honour to be. Sir,
Yours, obediently,

January 22, 1876.
THE whole Brigade of Guards consists of 875 men. Out of
these 875 men, no less than 17,643 are constantly in hospital, on
account of night sentry duty. Surely, these figures speak for them-
selves! \ours, accurately,

NIGHT sentry duty is. undoubtedly, bad for the Guards.
The men are deprived of their beds three nights out of six. In the
Line one guard night in seven is the usual average. Besides this,
London, Windsor, and Dublin life has its temptations. Might not
a Line Regiment occasionally relieve the Guards? Out of the
season, for instance, why should not the Highlanders come to Town,
and thus permit the Bearskins.to have a glimpse of Bonnie Scotland'(

ACTOES AT HOME.
A CoRBESPONDEtrr 'at Florence has lately favoured a London
journal with details of SALVINI'S domestic life. This will render
the following facts all the more interesting:—
ME. PHELPS, the veteran exponent of so many grand Shakspearian
characters, it is not generally known, has apartments at the top of
the Lambeth Shot Tower. He lives here in comparative loneliness,
with fifteen grandchildren, to whom he gives lessons in elocution
during six hours of the day. In his ordinary conversation his
utterance is very rapid, and delivered in a shrill counter-tenor,
which has a peculiar effect on those who hear him in private for the
first tune. It has been kept secret for a long time, but we believe
we are not indiscreet in making it public that this tragedian likes
nothing so well as athletic sports; and indeed, when not otherwise
engaged at Christmas time, ne appears as the Boneless Wonder at
a popular Circus. He has two performing Poodles which he is going
to introduce very soon to a London audience, and which it is expected
will be the rage next Season.
MB. CHARLES MATHEWS, the genial light comedian of this and
last century, is popularly supposed to be in Calcutta. It really is
his grandson who is now performing in India, but the resemblance
is so striking as to deceive his most intimate admirers. MK.
MATHEWS himself is now at Twickenham, where he may be seen any
morning sculling between Maidenhead and Oxford. His constitu-
tional pipe-opener" over, he retires to his study, where he is
correcting proofs of an annotated edition of PLATO'S Dialogues, with

for the footlights will not allow him to remain at nights away from

tastes for different from those he is usually credited with. He holds
a Spelling Bee every morning in his quiet little home in Thistle
Grove, which the Members of the Press are earnestly entreated to
join. After luncht which consists usually of a cold crumpet and aglass
of liquid magnesia, he repairs to the Young Man's Improvement
Society's Rooms in Sloane Street, and gives a lecture, which he
often prefaces with an extract from one of BLAIR'S Sermons. The
Series of Lectures now being delivered is on. the "Frivolity of
Giving Way to Laughter." MB. SOTHERN rises at live every
morning, and cooks his own simple meal of oatmeal porridge and
plovers' eggs.
MB. TOOLE, whose very name convulses a London audience, in the
privacy of his everyday life is of very ascetic habits. He retires to
bed as soon as he leaves the Gaiety (a name he would willingly
change if he could), in order that he may rise with the lark, to
pursue his favourite occupation of fetching watercress from the
suburban streams to till the baskets of a grateful tribe of coster-
mongers. In the afternoon he presides at the Cabmen's Mutual Aid
Society, under the name of MK. LA WHENCE, and is remarkable for
his reserved and austere manner. It is an extraordinary fact that
MR. TOOLE is widely known under another name as a great artist,
being probably the only representative of the classical painters left
in England. Up to the present time, his canvases have been of a
body
hit of the next exhibition in Burlington House. On Sundays,
MR. TOOLE is a constant attendant at the Tabernacle, and allows
himself one glass of Ipecacuanha wine at dinner.

THE SNOB'S PROGRESS.
MR. PUNCH now-a-days has rarely reason to complain of the treat-
ment he receives at the hands of his contemporaries. Years ago his
articles used to be pirated in the most unceremonious manner, but
since the century has entered into its second half the magic name of
Punch has usually been attached to the good things extracted and
reprinted from his immortal columns. This being tlie case, it is a
little annoying to find a highly respectable newspaper publishing a
letter which was .evidently intended for the Landoii Charivari.
"SISTE VIATOR " writes as follows:—
"An ordinary train is timed to leave the Great Western Station, Oxford, at
4'35 P.M. for the branch line to Witney and l*'airford—worked by the Great
Western Hallway Company with their accustomed punctuality and regard for
the convenience of their passengers. (N.B.—This is iair testimony, and not
'wrote sarkasticle.') On Saturday, the loth inst., this train was unusually
full. The time for starting arrived, but there was no departure. After a ten
minutes' pause, passengers began to be restive, and inquiry to be made; and
a little pressure elicited the fact that we were ' waiting for the HON. MR. ,
who had telegraphed to the Station Master to keep the train for him." It
further appeared that the 'honourable' traveller expected to arrive at the
London and North-Western Station at Oxford five minutes after the Great
Western train by which he desired to travel should have left that. station;
and, as the two stations are some live minutes' walk apart, a compliance with
this request must involve a delay of about ten minutes, and did in fact detain
the train for twenty minutes precisely. While this information was being
obtained, the Great Western Station Master prudently remained in ambush,
leaving his subordinates to encounter angry reproaches. But it seemed to be
clearly understood that this twenty minutes' detention occurred to oblige a
single intending passenger, and not by the authority of the Superintendent of
the line."
Is not this delicious? And yet this excellent story appears in
these columns at second hand. The selfish impertinence of "'the
HON. MR. ," and the cringing servility of "the official in am-
bush," are equally ludicrous. It is strange so capital an anecdote
should appear in a paper usually devoted to pure serious matter.
Mr. Punch knows that the story oan not be true, because time and
trains, like to-day, wait for no man. And yet the tale is related
with a curious atiectation of veracity. What shall ,Vr. Punch say?
Why, this: that if the story is true, it really is his duty to call the
attention of the Great Western Directors to the conduct of their pro-
vincial Station Master, and to declare the selfish ill-bred, "low-
form" traveller to be none other than that anything but mythical
personage "the HON. MR. SNOB."
Brutes In and Out of Boots.
•" POLICE Constable, 22 C, said that, while on duty on Monday night in
Crown Street, he saw the prisoner knack a woman down, kick her, and jump
on her body. It was elicited by the Magistrate that thn prisoner had no boot*
on; and the Magistrate said, 'had-the prisoner worn boots at the time, he
would have sent him to prison for three months, instead of, as he did, for
two months.' "—The Times, Wednesday, Jan. 19, 187G.
So, now the rough knows tiie tariff. To jumping on a woman,
with boots on, three months. To jumping on a woman without
boots, two months. No doubt, by a parity of reasoning, the amuse-
ment might be indulged in in slippers for a month; and in bare feet
for a week!

"ECCE NOS RURSUM."
(Pantomimes, Circuses, and Theatres.)
"Now. by our troth, but we must see this Surrey," says Some-
body in Somebody's historical play. Mr. Punch repeats it in refer-
ence to the Pantomime at the theatre of that ilk—taken all round,
and VOKESES apart, emphatically the best this year. That is, of
the theatrical Pantomimes proper. Punch must be allowed to keep
a special 'niche in his affections for the high-chivalric Ring-Panto-
mime,' Valentine and Orson (with such a beard), at HENGLER'S
Cirque, where BIBB the Inimitable almost succeeds in ousting
"SAITDY" himself—now a Sangerian instead of a Henglerian—from
our dear loves. The two stand like a brace of Circus Arcadians,
"Et cantare pares et respondere parati," the crowning clowns of
their generation. Altogether HENGLER'S opens to us a round, or,
should we not say. circle, or circus, or cirque of delight; and as the
joy of children is the sauce royal for all Christmas feasts of fun, give
us one Circus, with a clown like BIBB or SANDY, SANDY or BIBB,
and, better still, three Circuses—for, besides HENGLER'S, have we
not SANGER'S at Astley's, and RKARELLI'S in Holborn—before many,
nay, before most, theatres.
,-' "Currite Servi."
"At the Madras Cli|b nine different curries flavoured by as many different
chutnejB, were served to Hi* Boyd Highnew."
"Our Own," with the Prince.
THREE times three curries thrice three chutneys flavour!
Byeulla's plats, if not their plots, so thicken,
One thing the native Cooks won't curry—favour,
By surfeiting the Prince with curried chicken!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

CAVEAT NAVIGATOR.
OME recent revela-
tions have rendered
it almost impera-
tive that intending
voyagers by any
ocean steamers, with
the exception of cer-
tain favoured ones,
upon which Mr.
Punch occasion-
ally^ Camillalike
"skims the main,'
should make care-
ful investigations
and arrangements
before purchasing
their tickets.
The intending pas-
senger should claim
the right of exa-
mining the entire
cargo, in order to
ascertain whether
any dynamite is on
board.
After this, a care-
ful inspection of the
coals should be
made, in case any
torpedoes should have been introduced among them. As each
lump would have to be examined separately, this might occupy
some time, but to the apprehensive -mind it would be indispensable.
This done, the water-tight compartments should be carefully
examined, the intending passenger claiming the right to close them
and fasten them with padlocks, the keys of which he should imme-
diately place'in his pocket.
A descent into the lower hold would then be necessary, in order to
ascertain whether any mechanical "rats" were at work, or ready to
begin their work of boring holes through the ship's bottom.
Presuming that all had gone well so far, an arrangement should
be made with'the najpfatin, by whiak tkc intending passenger should
be at^liberty to see that every light is extinguished on board at a
given 'horrr, while insisting, besides, on the right of keeping for
himsdf.a private look-out ahead as a precaution against collisions,
particularly in quarters frequented byHer Majesty's cruisers.
After being rowed round the Tessel, in order to inspect the load-
line, it would be advisable that the intending passenger should go
ashore'and make'his will, at the same time taking> tender farewell
of his friends, and relatives.
These few_preliminaries being adjusted, there would be no objec-
tion to paying for the ticket and proceeding again on board, it
being,! or course understood that the intending passenger has a
Bpyton dress, or; perhaps, a collapsible boat in preference, and (if
his means permit} has chartered a private steamer, or stout sea-
going tug, to sail in company with the vessel in which he is going,
in ease 01 accident.
Other precautions night, of course, be taken, but the above would,
we believe, go far towards tranquillising a nervous temperament, and
even ensuring sound sleep, at more or leas widely separated intervals
of time. __ _
EXPERIMENT IN STREET-CLEANING.
UKA UKKS of the Rock will probably rejoice to'find it therein stated
that—
"A Carman was brought on Tuesday before the LORD MAYOK, charged
with unlawfully using profane, indecent, and obscene language in Billings-
gate Market. The charge was made at the instance of a Committee appointed
at a recent wardmote for the purpose of endeavouring to put down the practice
of using fool language."
KFhis Carman might as well have carried coals to Newcastle, as
bad language to Billingsgate. We are told he was dismissed with a
caution fromlhis Lordship, which we hope may render him more
cleanly in his speech.
Perhaps, when Billingsgate is purified, and the neighbourhood
adjacent, the Committee may extend their work to the West End.
A stroll on. Sundayjin the Parks, or the thoroughfares contiguous,
might convince them that bad language is not confined to Billings-
gate, and that juvenile offenders need to be corrected quitr as fully
as adults. Filthy words are used by children of both sexes, who
appear to take a pleasure in bawling them aloud. How to cleanse
these little foul months is a proat social question, which we fear that
the Committee (to whom we wish good speed most heartily) will find
it hard to solve. In morals, as in medicine, a foul tongue is a
certain indication of disease, and when children are afflicted with
it, they may be bettered sometimes by a dose from Dr. Birch.
A WAENING FKOM NEPTUNE.
BRITANNIA! Hoy! Belay, mv lass! What 's all this yarn I hear
About this lut new notion of the go-ahead Engineer?
Come, take a seat here at my feet, where oft you 've sat and heard
Your old salt-sea-sire's voice, whose ring your blood has ever stirred.
Of late you 've used me sourvily. I 've blushed for very shame
At things that brutes and bunglers have done to soil your name:
Scuttled ships, sunken seamen, and Slave-Circulars are not
The sort of things to feed my pride, or keep your blue from blot.
BOSTON and WEBB I winked at. I liked the Briton's grit.
If the Yankee's gutta-percha suit seemed to me a misfit,
We '11 pass all that. Bat this new game is coming it too strong.
Take NEP'S advice, and stop it, girl; the C.E.'s are all wrong.
The best gift you owe destiny is old NEP'S emerald ring,
To break it, for whatever bnbe, will never blessing bring.
Your Engineers are clever, but they '11 serve you ill who seek
To rob you of the safeguard of your guarding .Silver Streak.
I set you 'midst my subject seas and girdled in with,foani
Your isle for freedom's fortress, its altar and its home.
Beware, lass, how you break the spell! Think not my words a joke, —
'Tis sea-bonds clinch the fibres of your TJngKuli Hearts of Oak.
To bore beneath or build above the barrier set by me
Between your bastion cliffs and foes and rivals over-sea,
Is casting carelessly away your citadel's best guard,
Where patriot vigilance should keep its keenest watch and ward.
Eh? "Selfish insularity"? BBTTANXIA, my lass,
Don't be the fool of phrases! Helpful sympathy will pass,
By lightning flash, or force of cash, or steel — should need arise;
1 ou will not want a Tunnel, girl, to carry such supplies.
But foot-dry passage fixed and fast naffkt bring your foes to you,
Or help your mutineers, — such may be in every crew.
You 're far more stoutjthan ready, watching 's less your line than
fight,
And, should they take you by surprise, old NEP can't help your
plight!
In vain your ships might scour the seas should some dull blunderer
doze,
And let rogues snatch your street-door key under his snoring nose.
You 've had some lubbers in your crew. How would a Nelson feel
With foes who 'd slip from shore to shore beneath his very keel '<
Though all, in piping times of peace, are welcome to your land,
Remember that Achilles' heel could lame Achilles' hand.
Seeing old NEP has served you well by setting you apart,
The safety Nature gave you do not you give up to Art.
Why should you? What are doubtful gains, in cash or comfort,
weighed
With ne'er so faint a chance of foes ivithiii your walls conveyed '(
Are shores inviolate a boon to risk with calm content,
For boo-hoo of sea-sick tourists or bait of cent, per cent.?
Nay, let the Silver Streak still roll unbridgod, unburrowed still,
Still girdle with its shifting^sheen stout heart and strenuous .will,
Though cosmopolitans declaim and engineers devise.
It means security from shock, and safety from .surprise.
Self-centred, billow^circled, let BBiTAiraTA still abide,
Though insular not isolate; swept by no sudden tide
Of foeman or of fever-tit from any foreign shore,
When the Red Spectre raves abroad or war's slipped ban-dogs row!
On Opposite Sides.
MR. PITNCH, the general Arbiter Sleffantiarum, being asked his
opinion of the present Ladies' dress, with his usual taste and readi-
ness replied, "I highly approve the present fashion, comprehending
as it does the highest graces of two of the most distinguished types
of female beauty—modelled in front onthe Yenus de' Medici, behind,
on the Venus de Hottentott"'

O, CHURCH of England, whither dost thou wend,
Driven by heady Bishops, Rectors, Vicars '•:
Whose altar-flame, ere it to Heaven ascend,
r Via the sulphurous mouth of Hades flickers.
Your life in charity and virtue spend;
Abstain from rant and cant, cigars and liquors;
Live, like Stylites, on the loftiest level—
In vain, unless you own a personal Devil.
There are innumerable devils, surely:
The printer's devil hath his share of fame;
There's Mephistopheles, who tempts impurely;
There's sly Asmodeus, gossip-demon lame:
Old Nick from a bright eye may peep demurely;
There are blue devils, devilled biscuits, game—
Punch, who has known more than one atheist.
Would stare to meet an adiabolist.
0 Vicar, if the Devil's in the Creed,
Is he the Attorney-General of Jon,
Who is allowed his run of ADAM'S seed,
A dignitary clad in wig and robe,
Ornate in manner, plausible to plead,
The Public Prosecutor of the globe?
Or has he horns, tail, hoofs, which, if you scan 'em all,
Combine into a graminivorous animal?
It seems a satire upon things religious,
When two Archbishops and the Chancellor
Have to decide betwixt two folk litigious
Whether the Devil is or is not, or—
Seeing the might of Love and Power prodigious—
How the deuce he's to be accounted for.
The cleric mind in quarrels seems to revel:
Devil or none, some clerks will play the Devil!
QUITE Of THEIR LUTE.
THE question has been asked why MR. HOLMS selected
Sheffield as the place for his first speech on Army Re-
form. He knew the people of that busy manufacturing
town must take a deep interest in rank and file.
THE PLAGUE.
MR. PUNCH,
I SKK by the public prints that a paper has been read to
show there is a "prospect of a reappearance of Plague in this
country and on the Continent of Europe." .The Continent of Europe
I _ leave to others, but I fearlessly assert that Plague has never
disappeared from England. My proofs are set out below. I challenge
all the Medical Officers of Health, and all the professional journals,
and all the learned societies, to gainsay or contradict them.
A SUFFERER OF MANY YEARS' STANDING.
What a plague it is when the boys are all home for the holidays,
and there comes a week of wet weather!
What a plague it is when the house has to be cleaned!
What a plague tiresome children are!
What a plague Rates and Taxes are!
What a plague Bills are!
What a plague Bores are!
What a plague it is when your wife and daughters insist on your
giving a dance!
What a plague smoky chimneys are!
What a plague Beggars and Organ-grinders are!
What a plague Circulars and " Appeals " are!
What a plague it is when the Drains have to be looked to, or the
pipes burst, or the kitchen boiler gets out of order!
What a plague—" the greatest plague of life "—Servants are!
Fine Opening for a Young Man.
IT is stated that the vacant Lordship of the Treasury is to be
filled up by the appointment of VISCOUNT CRICHTON. The new Lord
will have an unexampled opportunity of reviving in his own
person, by the most strenuous devotion to the duties of his office,
the proud title of the " Admirable CRICHTON."
THE dUEEN r. CURLING.
SOME young Englishwomen, whose studies are limited to the Fashion
Books, may, probably have stared at the following announcement
in a fashionable Contemporary, if they ever read anything so
rational as a daily paper:—
"A DISCOURAGEMENT TO OHLEKS.—The Balmoral Curling Club, which
only played its maiden game last winter, has ceased to exist, orders having
been writ to all the members of the Club on the Royal estate* to discontinue
the game."
That, however, the " maiden game " of curling has nothing to do
with any capillary arrangement will be deducible by the least
reasoning of young Ladies from what follows:—
"HER MAJESTY ii understood to have disapproved of the game, owing to
its tendency to encourage a lore for whiskey.
It must be obvious to the meanest capacity, that the discouragement
to Curlers, given, according to the above statement, by Royal pro-
hibition, is nothing that girls have any occasion to trouble their
heads about. Though, even if it concerned the head-dress at all, it
would not concern them; for curls are not fashionable, and it is
only those girls who think, in a measure, for themselves, and possess
some little mind and taste of their own, that are capable of curling
their hair, if curls become them better than the chignon, or top-knot,
or whatever it is called, howsoever grotesque, which is the general
PLURAL AND SINGULAR.
IRELAND has Home Rulers. When the Member for Hackney is
installed at the War Office, England will have a HOLMS Ruler.
CONCLUSION OF A CHEESEMONGER.—Mite is right.

"WHAT THEY DID.
THHY assembled round a large fire—an admirable receptacle for Admiralty Minutes and
Slave Circulars. Some oae added fuel to it: who it was i* Mot clear. A great waste-paper
ki.-.k i-t standing handy was also not without its sugigestiyeness.
They talked aboutjthe wea&cr. the floods, shipping disasters, the state of the nation, and
for some of the "Ministers had waited—of the streets.
Then they commenced business.
ME. DISRAELI proposal a riddle (like the Sphinx), and alluded to some Canal Shares he
had lately bought.
The LORD CHANCELLOR placed a mark in one of the many treatises on the New Judicature
Act which he had been reading, and laid down the law.
The DCJCE OF RICHMOND, LEKKOX, DAUBIGNV, AND QoBBOS, described the delightful
sensation of feeling like four single Dukes rolled into one.
The EARL OF MALMESBTJRY played with a seal.
MR. SECRETARY CROSS hummed " Home.' Street Home '."
Mu. SECRETARY HARDY did not hum "HOLMS, sweet HOLMS!" On the contrary, he
startled his colleagues by uttering a loud War-cry of defiance. Afterwards he calmed
down, and asked the Council their opinion as to the correct spelling of Mobilization—
whether with "z," or "a."
The EAJIL OF CABNABVON was engrossed with FROUDE.
The MARQUIS OF SAXISBT/RY related anecdotes of the Prince's tour in India, and quoted
"OWEN MEREDITH " a propos of LORD LYTTON going to " hear the leopard in the hills.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER looked cheerful and happy in such Friendly
Society. Then a shade passed across his face. Was he thinking of the Deputations that
awaited him before Budget night? But he soon brightened up, when he thought of the
Probate Duty payable on BARON ROTHSCHILD'S Will.
MR. G. WARD HUNT sat plunged in deep reverie, and was silent for many (Admiralty)
minutes together. Perhaps ne was reflecting how far preferable was the Bench at Quarter
Sessions to the quarter-deck.
LORD JOHN MANNERS did his best to swell
the revenue of his own department by
writing letters and sending telegrams.
The KARL OF DERBY, after a brief con-
sultation with MR. DISRA.KLI and one or two
more, answered a note from a foreign cor-
respondent. The post-mark was " Vienna,"
and the signature "AlfDEASSY."
Business being thus concluded, all the
Ministers joined in a Spelling Bee, and
enjoyed it so thoroughly, that, when the
meeting broke up, summonses were imme-
diately issued for another Cabinet Council
(and another Spelling Bee) on the- following
day.
MAMMON'S METAMORPHOSIS.
A Buii and Bear together sat,
In friendly and convivial chat;
Together they are wont to sup,
Though this tear down, and that toss up:
Both leek for Danae's golden rain,
Both drink the very best champagne;
Both 'con assume a human shape
More palpable than DABWHT'B Ape.
They discussed Stocks of all descriptions,
8paniards,.Peruvians, Turks, 'Egyptians;
Each had his visions unsubstantial,
And prated much of schemes financial,
And each beyond the other went
As to the right amount per cent.,
While Mr. Punch, the wise and witty,
Who does no business in the City;
Caught casual words (he scorned to listen),
Watched the grim gossips' keen 'eyes
glisten,
As through the wo :ld they took their range
Prom their standpoint—the Stock Ex-
change,
That Pare awe cerfs of Mammon King-
That fouler, fatter, Betting Ring.
Bull and Bear gone, Punch felt relieved,
Yet over greed and folly grieved.
He sipped his port of many summers,
Nectar, uncorked not for chance comers—
For such it were a serious sin
To -tap the Poet laau-efttie's bin—
And thought how many weak outsiders
Play flies to these stock-jobbing spiders.
Cp go their *i«Mi«>i wares, or down
Thare 's joy or panic in the Town:
None seem to see that down or up
Means nothing in an empty cup;
That nations which -their coin have spent,
Although they promise ten per vent.,
Can never pay you fire or three—
Since "What's impossible can't be."
Punch, as he smoked his last cigar,
Blest his unspeculative star,
Pitied the fate of foolish foik
Who 11 buy aa egg with addled yolk
When knaves who sell with might and
main
Swear 'twifl one day be fresh again.
His verdict on the <iase is tills:
There's010 such metamorphosis.
Till blood for sawdust out of doll*
You draw, Turks won't tap like Cnmsols.
Though Bears that hngand Italls that toss
May hoens-pocog gain and loss,
Though with their "High, Low, Presto,
Pass!"
Confounding wits of owl and ass,
They ring the changes—here and there—
From Boar to Bull,.from Bull to Bear!

presenting his wife to the Holy Father, he eannot a^y^t be said to
have made his Holiness a still "handsomer present. That he will be
fully enabled to do so on an early day, however, "is hoped for." In
the pheasant-coyer it used to be a saying among sportsmen that
"where the cock is, the hen is not far off. The parties who hope
for the MARCHIONESS OF RIPON'S conversion reckon, perhaps, without

OUR REPRESENTATIVE" IN INDIA.

.il-CUTTA — I'll route,—
Jumnton—Lahore—3fu*t
interesting particulars—
The Vie Intime—Prnx-
peta,
MY VERY DEAR SIR,
You did not get
a letter i'rom me last week because the weather was so dreadfully bad there
was nothing doing, at least worth mentioning. The Golden Umbrella was of
no more use against those severe falls in Downpore than a parasol under Niagara.
Fortunately we were well entertained by the RAJAH OF INDORE, and so did not
care about going out.
We had the Punjabbers (native jesters) in for an hour or two, and then sat
down to a Spelling Bee. I gave 'era a word which floored them all: it was
"Tf'ffsp." The I)—E OF S-TS-BL-D borrowed a pocket dictionary from the
Assistant-Secretary, who was just on the point of handing it to liiuij when 1
called oat, in excellent Hindostanee, "On skral!" and my Accomplished and
Royal Patron observed, with mote severity perhaps than the occasion actually
required, that "if they couldn't play fair, they shouldn't play at all," which
intimation, I am glad to say, had the desired effect.
L-Ri) C-R-SGT-N spit it " n'«w»s"—but he was educated nt Cambridge.
L-RD B-R-S-F-RD spelt it "Warsp—and lost two rupees by having backed
himself to win. The D-E OF S-TII-BI.-XD was ivery much annoyed on beinj
informed that " Wotp" was a mistake, though not had phonetically; anc
W. II. ll-w-LL accounted for his rendering of it as " ll'hnps" by informing us
that this was in reality the Celtic origin of the word. We did not, however
give him a second chance, and Hltimntely it was won by my Learned anr
Exalted Companion, who, with the greatest ease, hit it off correctly the verj
first tinre of asking. After this the children of t<lR JF.EJF.E JePMBBHOt came in
and played horses, wbile we sat round the room on cushions, smoking hotcdiths
and sipping mnstnlyett (a sort of sweet liqaoriee-water having rather the flavour
irf oystefs).*
After this the children were taken off to bed by SnroH LULLAH LULLABY, the
Ayah night-nurse, whose sole office in the establishments of the wealthier

But I will not continue what in your cold phleg-
matic Saxon country might be misconstrued into mere
fulsome adulation. Still, entre nous, I hare deserved it,
for I 've been larish with the coin. I have not waited
for official orders from head-quarters. No, I have been
all heart and pocket, in the interest, of course, of the
British Dynasty in India. So free-handed in this way
have I been as' to have justly gained the sobriquet of
Tippoo SAHIB, i.e., the Sahib who tips. Why, my dear
friend, with a neat Durbar twisteu round my head, a
Serai m mv hand, and some walnut juice on my face, 1

But I only mention the above facts to show you what
can be done by a little attention to the wants of a
naturally loyal and trusting race.
Talkiiig of "trusting," in consequence .of your re-
mittances not having arrived in time, I have been com-
pelled to adopt the system known in India as that of
T'ikh. This plan, which, in some cases, supersedes
ready-money payments, was invented by the NOBOH or
ODUJIFHORE, a celebrated Indian financier, who, with
SHAHPVR, of Swindlia—the SHAHPFR, as he is called
here—contributed so largely to the extensive failures of
some of the biggest houses in Calcutta. The Nobob
bolted, and the unhappy SHAHTPR was arrested at
Aritsur—a sad spectacle of another good man gone
wrong.

Crowds to receive us. A variety of colour, creed, caste, and com-
pany. Here are the Nabobs, the Nobobs. and the Hobnobs, all
fraternising together. A cheering sight. Here is a swarthy Nobnob
(or big swell) reining in his fiery little Kobkob (or native Indian
pony) while talking to a young but wealthy Sunnob, who is giving
himself as many airs as though he were the SIIAHPITR, or even the
HOLKAE himself.
There, in the corner, stands a lynx-eyed Sobbee (or native Police-
man), and near him a fellow of lowest caste, who, I could swear, is
the well-known RROBAR of Burraglaree, who, it is believed, is still
at large.
Just by the door of the Shanttc stands, his hand on his jewelled
sword, the stately GHAUT; while arm in arm with the paunchy
little BOWLEE is the aristocratic BHISTEY, who is not ashamed on
this occasion to drop hereditary animosities and indulge in a friendly
giizzul with a handsome representative of the too-often despised
Florfkans, and one of the insidious and mealy mouthed denizens of
the Tatarkan district, dressed in his ragged brown jacket.*
• At this point we have recourse to our Dictionary. The word Ghaut we
cannot find in it. But we would be on our oath that it it an Indian word,
and yet it does not recommend itself to our memory as meaning a human
boing of any kind. We may, however, be quite wrong on this point: wo
acknowledge ourselves in having been, at least once, quit* wrong; i.e., when
we gave that boy half-a-sovereign to go and buy a new Dictionary. It is now
itat seven u-eekx since that boy disappeared. However, to resume, Bowlee is
"a well," not a "paunchy little man"; Bhittey is a " w»ter-carrier," who
can, we should imagine, scarcely be " aristocratic." Here, however, we admit
We are to have another grand ball to-morrow, which, it is
expected, is to be crowded by the natives, to whom I am invariably
told off to do the honours. The fact is, I have won their hearts, and,
by the way, shouldn't mind winning their diamonds; but no doubt
even this would come in time.
I get on capitally with the natives, specially at supper. But,
indeed, on such festive occasions I have never yet found any natives
disagree with me, and, goodness knows, I have had large dealings
with dozens of 'em in my time. Here some of the natives are
bearded and some not, and, though of a retiring disposition, I soon
manage to get them out of their shell.
AVe have been badly off for sport lately, but at Lahore I managed
to bag three' Nuggars (a kind of long-tailed animal, something
between a fox and a goose), one Pat/tan (of the panther tribe),.a fine
Beloochc (not unlike our titmouse), and a brace of Rajpoots—which
last are of the genus partridge, only of a brighter colour.
I must now leave off, as CANON DUCKWORTH wants me to give
him a few hints for his to-morrow's sermon, and I have also to
entertain a bevy of Parsee Indies at our five o'clock tea, or Indian
Drum, which has become an institution on Saturday afternoons.
CANON DUCKWORTH is an excellent fellow, just the sort of Parson
who ought to be canonised—as he has been. On Sundays he gives
us a good burst of fifteen minutes' eloquence, and he makes all the
points I 've given him on the previous afternoon. You see I know
the rie Mime of his audience better than he does, and in arranging
the hits of the sermon I can put in some nasty home-thrusts now
we may be in error. A Hindoo, acquainted only with our military terms,
would scarcely imagine that a " Sergeant" could be a great legal dignitary
only one remove from a Judge, and so it may be with a Bhwtey or water-
carrier. Quziul we have looked out before. It sounds like drinking, but it
is really " an erotic ode." A Florikan is not a man of any race, but "a bird
of the bustard tribe." As for the " Tatarkan district" we have searched the
map of India in vain for such a place: yet it may be there. A young friend
about Town, who has just dropped in, asks us if we couldn't find something
nearer home resembling the Tatarkan? We cannot believe that Our Repre-
sentative is merely inventing a name. But we have our plan—and in another
week we shall be in a position to tell the public more.—ED.

Can any Clergyman of the Church of England be so inflated by
self-esteem without self-respect, so destitute of dignity, charity,
common-sense and taste, so devoid of all perception of absurditv,
as to be conceived capable of penning this notice? It must be a
thing devised by the enemy"—the fling of hostile and unscrupulous
Sectarians. Perhaps they will next advertise MR. MANNING as
renouncing the clerical black and white tie because Weslevan
Ministers wear them, and adopting coloured clothes and a bird's-
eye fogle instead.
It may be that the letters " P. P." arc insidiously intended to be
taken for " Parish Priest," so making out the namesake of CARDINAL
MANNING a Ritualist aping the style of his Eminence's Priest-
hood. Suppose a Popish Priest were to publish a request that
nobody should subjoin to his name the letters "P. P.," now dese-
crated in their permitted assumption by a Protestant heretic?
Would you not consider him as great an ass as a Church of England
Clergyman renouncing the title of "Reverend " because it has been

bers of Parliament are

MAJOR McGoRMAN will

MR. WHALLEY will bore
the House with stories of imaginary grievances and impossible
plots.
MR. PLIMSOLL will lose his temper in a good cause.
SIR CHARLES DILKK will pick poles' in the British Constitution,
and show how to mend them by his private ^patent processes.
MR. DISRAELI, in answering plain questions, will be mysterious
facetious, or flippant, as the exigences of the case may require—but
never discourteous,or explicit, or perfectly intelligible.
The MARQUIS op HARTINGTON will conduct the Opposition, subject
to the embarrassing supervision of MESSRS. GLADSTONE, FORSTEH,

The above gentlemen will pull different ways,'' as 'tis their nature to."
SIR THOMAS CHAMBERS will prose away (for the twentieth time)

ances of the West End tradesmen.
MR. MACDONALD will do his best by his advocacy to render
unpopular the cause of the Working Man.
And lastly, DR. KENEAIY will—but no, let us indulge the hope
that " the Doctor " will not appear at all this Session, being too much
occupied in establishing a new Religion.

A VISIT TO THE WESTMINSTER AQUARIUM.
"TJprouse ye then, my merry, merry, men,
For 'tis our opening day. —The Chough and Crow.
(Omitted from the Aquarium Programm.)
I CAN perfectly imagine the moment when the now managing-
director (pro. tern.), MR. WYBROW ROBERTSON, returning from a
visit to the Brighton Aquarium, >-,,i Victoria, compelled to masterly
inaction in his Hansom by a block system of complicated carts, car-
riages, cabs, and omnibuses, looked to the right and the left, and said
to himself What a good thoroughfare for a show! and nothing
here but the Abbey, the Houses of Parliament, and the Law Courts!
Then his mind reverting to the Brighton ho had so recently quitted,
there must have occurred to him one of those electric flashes of in-
spiration, now popularly known as a
Happy Thought. Here's the place for an Aquarium.
Evidently the very thing! All that London in general, and West-
minster in particular, could want to complete its happiness was,
surely, an Aquarium. Then it arose out of the earth with, com-
paratively speaking, the celerity of Aladdin's Palace. An eminent
architect was obtained for the fabric, an eminent naturalist for the
fish, and an eminent composer for the fantasias. Other eminent
persons were soon got hold of to appear as Fellows, so that at last
for one Gentleman to call another a fellow, and to receive the retort
"you 're another," came to be, Aquariumly speaking, rather a thing
to be proud of than otherwise. This short ferm in the_ neighbour-
hood of St. Stephen's became, as it were, the Masonic pass-word
among the Fish-exhibiting fraternity,
"Sir, you 're a Fellow P'
"Sir, you 're aaothei!"
And this was the sign- and coantersign accessory for entrance on
Saturday, January 22nd.
The Aquarium was opened in some sort of State. A crowd in
reserved and unreserved places wondering what was about to happen
next. All eyes on a set of decorated private-boxes, with the Royal-
box in the middle, guarded by (apparently) sailors, who, in turn-
down collars and short jackets, looked as if they 'd grown out of
that kind of dress, and were feeling rather awkward in not having
been put into stick-ups and tails long ago.
Then came a great time for inquisitive people who always want to
know all about it, whatever it is, and well-informed persons who
always do know all about it, and are equal to any emergency.
Inquisitive Visitor. I say. why have the sailors got guns?
Tf ell-Infornicd friend. They 're Naval Artillery.
Inquisitive Visitor (only half-convinced]. Oh! but artillery have
cannons, not guns.
Well-informed Friend. Ah! but these are on duty, and they
always go about as the body-guard of the DUKE OF EDINBURGH, the
Sailor Prince.
Inguisitire Friend. Ah ! yes. Good idea having them here instead
of soldiers. Soldiers would have been out of place among fish.
Happy Thought (far the title of a new ballad). The Soldier and
the Fish. Suggested gratis to MH. ARTHUR SULLIVAN. It might be
appropriately played by the Cold-streams.
Inquisitive Friend (using owni-glassest). I say, who 'f that in a
private-box with lace on hi» shirt—?
WeU-Iuformed Person. That's a Sheriff.
Inquisitive Friend. Ok! (Then apparently resenting the intrusion.}
TIT- ', i , r\
YV hy s no here f
Well-Informed Person (nonplussed fur on.cc in his life). I don't
know. (Recovering kimself.) Oh! because he was asked.
Inyuisitice Visitor. Who's that in » fez?
n ell-Informed Person (proud of his superior Jcnoicledge). Thai is
the Turkish Ambassador.
Inquisitive Visitor (as before). Why's he here?
Funny Gentleman from the Stock Exchange (overhearing and an-
;<i>-: ,;„</}. He's just the man for the place. He'» here, as the repre-
sentative of a decidedly fishy State.
Hats off, and enter the DUKE OF EDINBURGH. He stands up in
his box, and somebody facing him, reads him an address. It looks
uncommonly like Punch and Judy, with the squeak and the dia-
logue left out, as the voice part is inaudible.
Inquisitive Friend. What's he doing?
Funny Gentleman. He's hearing the Duke his Catechism.
Then the Duke replies, also inaudibly, bows, accepts the paper,
hands ijt to somebody to put away somewhere, and then the Concert
begins. The songs are most appropriately chosen; the first, sung by
MADAME PATEY, being evidently intended as, somehow or other,
applicable to the DUKE OF EDINBURGH on the present occasion,
commencing,
"Gentle youth, ah! tell me why?"
which is the sort of question the Inquisitive Gentleman has been
putting with reference to the presence of every notability in the
building for the last half-hour.
MADAME PATEY, still singing, then goes on to hid H.R.H. the
Duke leave the building as quickly as possible:—
"Far from hence, oh haste away!
To the heart iU ease restore,
Go, and never tet mt more.'"
Which command, if the accomplished songstress represented the
Genius of the Aquarium, was scarcely a cheery sort of welcome to
the Sailor Prince.
Then MADAME WYNNE, more in harmony with the spirit of the
occasion, informed the Nautical Prince that she would
"Dance on the sand*;"
but this smacked more of Margate than the Westminster Aquarium,
which has not, as yet, obtained its dancing licence from the Magis-
trates.
SIM» I; i.i v KM obliged the company with "You'll Remember Me"
which it is to be hoped they did, handsomely.
The great feature of the Orchestra, under MR. SULLIVAN'S able
direction, was an advertisement stuck up over the player of th« big
drum, announcing, apparently, the name of the player (mo other
musician being labelled in this way) as "POTTER & Co." Somebody
said it was the name of the firm who built the drum. The audience
refused to accept this, and all the interest felt in that Concert was
centred in "POTTER. & Co." Others in the band might be greater
musicians, but few. except the initiated, knew'them by name; and
so " POTTER & Co. had it, so to speak, almost entirely to himself.
The musical honours of the day were, undoubtedly, shared by MR,
SULLIVAN. MR. GODFREY, and POTTKR & Co."
What did "POTTER & Co."—a most respectable elderly gentle-
man, by the way—care for the vocalists? While they sang, he had
an easy and luxurious time of it. Suddenlv, three raps from the
li,ilon of the Conductor awoke "PorrEftA Co." from his reverie.
He was called into action. No; he was not wanted as yet; and,

into the repose from which he had been so unwarrantably aroused.
Ah! now /—at last his time has come.
The Procession March" by ARTHUR SULLIVAN. A nod of rccog-

calm, determined, and unimpassioned wav in which " POTTER & Co.
settled down to work. No unnecessary nourishes of his drumstick,
as a showy, younger, and less experienced musician mig^it have
been tempted to give, with such a weapon in his hand. Not a bit.
He hit the drum as though he loved it; tenderly, almost reluctantly
at first ; then warming to his work, encouraged by the eye-glass of
his chief, and impelled by a stern sense of duty, he came down on
that drum so as to make it writhe again, and bellow under the thud.
But when his part was finished, when dulcet strains succeeded,
then with more than maternal care did " POTTER & Co." pat and
caress the suffering instrument, and not a few among the audience
but felt a choking sensation in the throat, as they saw that venerable
man turn aside and use his pocket-handkerchief, doubtless to wipe
away a tear. Beat on! thou Loving Heart! Thy joys and sorrows
are appreciated by the public! Oh! well deserved was the dejeuner
of "POTTER & Co.," when he and his instrument sat down with a
drumstick between them.
Last Happy Thought (but one) at the Aquarium. Get some fish.
Or, why not a pond with sticklebacks for the boys to fish in't
Or,—Last Happy Thought of all. While the Tanks are unoccupied,
wouldn't it be an excellent plan to turn them into private baths,
getting eminent individuals to bathe in them—(pretty bathing dresses
being provided, of course)—and let in the public, as at present,
to stare at them through the glass fronts? It could easilv be adver-
tised. For example: Saturdays, MR. GLADSTONE (Tank No. 1), from
10 till 1. MR. DISRAELI (Tank No. 2), from 2 till 4; and so on—the
Band playing all day, and refreshments handed round. There ought
to be some special attraction pending the arrival of the still absent
Octopus and the Fish of the Future.
JOURNEYS "PERFORMED."
THE Manchester Examiner states that the Lancashire and York-
shire Railway Company have resolved to paint their first-class
carriages yellow, the second-class brown, and the third blue. The
tickets will be of the same colour as the carriages. This will give the
trains a nice and lively appearance, it is true, and may serve to beguile
the minds of anxious passengers; but it must be admitted that for
certain lines of railway the most appropriate colour for the carriages
would be black, with feathers for the first-class and other less
costly marks of mourning for the second and third. The tickets
might be black-edged, and ornamented with a funeral urn. The
Guard's costume should resemble as closely as possible that of an
undertaker, and the journeys should be "performed " as much like
funerals as possible, with all the chances of cremation included.
Of course an undertaking should be given, and kept, that all
trains will carry an experienced surgeon, and that a proper propor-
tion of ambulances, with all the necessary surgical appliances, will
accompany every excursion and express.

YOUNG CHELSEA V. OLD.

O, tell me not, in cold an-
ticipation,
>'c.\t Session's horo-
smpe portends sfirma-
tion,
While Chelsea's Baronet
o'er vasty deeps,
The Stormy Petrel of the Future, sweeps.
(>r among birds is Petrel's flight too narrow?
Should we not rather call him JavaRparrow 't
From that far isle one day wo hear his
twitter,
The next at C'helsea lie shows, brisk and
bitter.
The liveliest '.' sparrer" if a wildish
hitter.
Pardon the pun let "sparrow" be pre-
ferred
For him who skims o'er subjects like a bird,
And wider, wiser, than e'er bird that new,
The world embraces in a bird's-cyc view.
Not the bird's-eye, of course, in smoke that
ends,
But that which loftiest elevation lends,
To look down on the British Constitution—
Old -wheel-work, but still good for revolu-
tion!
After swift survey, hear him condescending
To prove to ns how all in it needs mending.
So one may sometimes see a Chelsea sparrow
Peeping into a bone that once held marrow,
And after squinting down it for a minute,
Conclude, on-hand, that there is nothin
in it.
When the contents but lie beyond his
peep,—
The Sparrow s ken too short, the bone too
deep.
By CHAKKKKS let " old Chelsea's " praise be
sung.
Punch, chief of chaffers, takes his Chelsea
young.
At sales old Chelsea mugs may cut a figure,
Young Chelsea's mug, self -mirrored, cuts
a bigger.
Let China-maniacs the old prefer,
The young 's omniscient, and can never err;
Then happy C'helsea, whose far - seeing
Bart.,
Survey? mankind, and scorns not to impart
To "free and independents" ne'er so rough,
Of his collective wisdom quantum suff.;
Nay some, profane, may say, mare than
enough.
THOROUGHFARE v. BARRACKS.
POVEHXMEXT, it is reported, have deter-
mined to pull down the Knightsbridge Bar-
racks. So far so good. But they have also
determined, it is said, to build another, and
bigger, and better, block of barracks in their
stead.
Kensingtonia, a wealthy and fashionable
suburb, naturally objects to any such erection
—with its fringe of beerhouses and music-
halls—in its midst, and is up in arms, and,
like other interesting creatures in arms, crying
loudly. As it has Lords and Millionnaires to
utter its disgust, there is no fear but it will
make its wrongs and wishes very distinctly
audible.
There are so many move crying grievances
pressing on poorer Metropolitan populations,
that Punch cannot bring himself to take this
of Keusingtonia from the Knightsbridge bar-
racks very seriously to heart. Still, if a wider
roadway could be substituted for a eavalry
barracks, no doubt all who have occasion to use
a much frequented approach to the Metropolis
would bless the Board of Works.
THE WABDEN OF THE STANDARD.
"BOTTLE MEASTUE.—The Warden of the Standard
lias occasion airain te advert to the subject of the size
of bottles. Six years ago it was represented to the
Standards Commission th.it wmo and tile bottles,
commonly known as reputed quarts or pints, were
getting smaller. The Warden or the Standard Terified
standards of these measures in 18"0, and he now re-
ports that he re-verified them in 1875. But lie has
to state thnt these newly-lepralised measures do not
appear to lie murh used. In the whole of the last
few years not ([uite a hundred bottle and half-bottle
measures have been verified for the use of local
inspectors of weights and measures; only two in the
hut year !"—Xt'icxptrpcr Paragraph,
UKRK '* the Warden of the Standard!
A useful officer he;
Though by many Good Templars slandered,
The need of his office I see.
He has a good deal of work in
Making the publicans swear,
Yet hogshead, kilderkin, h'rkin,
Are smaller than once they were.
In his drink the labourer i* eut short,
Getting a pint and a half for a quart.
The Warden stamps the bottles
That are brought to him to stamp:
Alas for thirsty throttles
When the Bungs fair measure scamp!
Thev laugh at you, not rarely,
With a mean, dishonest laugh,
When for your quart you pay squarely,
And get but a pint and a half.
Measures are passed of a silly sort:
Best measure of all is the honest quart.
Good Bung, give us malt full measure,
Drink brewed in October prime,
Wherein to dip beak is a pleasure,
And to scrimp thereof a crime.
Here's health to squire and peasant
Who own or till the ground,
Both find their liquor pleasant;
1 wish it were always sound!
But a plague on the salted and hocussedtap
The labourer often is doomed to lap—
The man who sells such deserves a rap!
The Voice of Truth's Last Lie.

JOHN JONES, 70, a starved-Iooking man, was charged with having
stolen four potatoes. Witnesses haying deposed to the potatoes
being found in the prisoner's possession, the Bcnclt asked Him if he
had anything to say for himself. The prisoner said he was starving.
The R^v. L. DBASE said ho ought to be ashamed of himself. If that
was all he had to say, he had better have held his tonstue. The
prisoner said the potatoes were rotten, and that he founa them in
me middle of the road. LOHD SHALLOW remarked that that asser-
tion was. oh the face of if, false, as rotten potatoes never grew in
tlu: middle of roads; a remark in which the rest of the Beach con-
curred. The Risv. MrSio CtrinirN asked if there were ally previous
convictions against the prisoner. Poliee-Gonstable Z 11 said the
pnsmef had always borne ri very good character. The Reverend
Gentleman said he considered that made the case worse. It was

Tne' urosecufrix, whose head was enveloped in bandages, and who
was sffll so weak from tier recchf frijuries tliar sh'e Ka'd to be accom-
modated with a chair, said that last Saturday her husband came
home drunk, and asked her for money. On her telling him she had
none, he knocked her clown with the poker, then kicked her for
half-an-hour, and finally turrjed her out of doors for the night. The
Bench asked the prisoner what he had to say for himself. The
prisoner said" he was a little overcome, and had no recollection of
anything his wife had deposed to. The REV. L. DBASE thought
that altered the ease very much. AVas the prosecutrix so ignorant
of the duties of Christianity and the married state that she did not
know that it was her duty as a wife to have forgiven, her husband
under the circumstances f J. FOOZLE, ESQ.. concurred. Women never
did any good by pulling up their husbands, any more than by
nagging at them. The prosecutrix said she had forgiven her husband
several times before. The REV. MINTO CUMMIN asked if he was to
understand that she had been beaten previously, and had never
charged her husband with the offence? The prosecutrix said that
was so. The Reverend Gentleman could only observe that, according
to his reading of the law of the land, she had been guilty of the
heinous offence of compounding a felony, and had rendered herself
liable, he believed, to penal servitude. It was for her husband to
say whether he would press for a conviction. The prisoner said that
as his wife earned more wages than himself, he wouldn't. After a
short deliberation, the Bench acquitted the prisoner of the assault,
but fined him five shillings for drunkenness.
The money having been paid, LOUD SHALLOW said that he thought
it was his duty, on behalf of himself and his brother Magistrates, to
siy how pleased they were with the generous manner ia which the
prisoner had refrained from pressing against his wife the charge of
compounding felony, and cautioned the woman to be earoful iu
future.

PUNCH OPENS PARLIAMENT.

WILL not have opened till after this number goes to Press. The
Queen's Speech will have to wait a week for Punch's commentary.
Failing the actual discourse, why should not Punch offer a
Speech of his own as the best substitute? This might run:—
MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
I CONGRATULATE you, the Nation, and the QUEEN, on the
opening of Parliament by HEH MAJESTY in person and in State.
I condole with you on your return to the gloom and fog and
dirt of this great Metropolis. I observe a growing tendency to
postpone the date of vour re-assembling to as late a day as pos-
sible. I cannot wond"er at this reluctance on your part to come
back to London.
I commend to your notice the discreditable state of its streets,
especially after snow-storms.
The inundations which befell many parts of the country during
the recess have been followed by a flood of new Peers and Baronets.
If, by means of questions addressed in no unfriendly spirit to those
amongst these Noblemen and Gentlemen who form part of your
ranks, you can extract from them the reasons for their elevation, you
will solve a difficulty which has perplexed many intelligent persons.

• Tailor.
Since last you met within these walls, an agreeable place of relax-
ation and amusement has been opened near to the seat of your
deliberations. I refer to the Royal Aquarium, where you will have
the opportunity of unbending; your minds, after too long and too
close attention to your legislative duties. I venture to suggest to
Her Majesty's Government the propriety of holding their annual
Ministerial Fish Dinner at this establishment.
The Royal visit to India has proved a gratifying success, and will,
I trust, induce you to take a greater interest in the concerns of that
vast country than you have of late years displayed. Perhaps the
diversion of boar-hunting, from which so much was expected, has
proved more satisfactory to the pigs than to the Prince. By the aid
af an intelligent and trustworthy eyewitness I have endeavoured to
keep you fully acquainted with every detail of the Royal progress.
Should it be necessary to ask for a supplementary grant, grant it
without a moment's hesitation or a night's debate.
Of the relations of this country with Foreign Powers, I foresee
that you and I will hear more than enough. It is hard to believe
that the sick man " who is in such straits on the Bosphorus con
ever be convalescent. It remains to be seen whether a recent trans-
action in Canal Shares with His Highness the KHEDIVE OF EGYPT
will hold water. The startling project of a Tunnel under the English
Channel, to connect this country and France, is worthy of a few
minutes of your serious attention. Spain is much as usual. Germany
and England will, I hope, never be other than the best of friends.
You have had the happiness of seeing that the PRINCESS OP WALES
ias returned from Denmark in health and safety. Sweden and
Norway never give ME. BRIGHT, myself, and other experienced
salmon-fishers a moment's uneasiness. You will all, I am convinced,
wish success to the approaching Centennial Exhibition at Phila-
delphia.
England must have a real Army—not the show and shadow of one.
I trust to your common sense to look facts in the face, and to provide
the means of effective national defence.
GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,
When the annual Estimates are laid before you, I trust you
will devote due time and attention to their consideration. Be
liberal, but not extravagant; economical, but not niggardly.
Should the year's accounts show a surplus, I am confident that
you could not better employ a portion of it than in augmenting the
pay and salaries of those meritorious persons in the service of the
Crown whose means of living hove not increased with the increasing-
expenses of living. A great and wealthy country like ours should
not be outdone in remuneration of its servants by a bank or a brewery.
Mr LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
"Circulars," as we all know, are troublesome and annoying,
but sometimes we are obliged to read and consider their contents,
even though we should afterwards throw them into the waste-paper
basket. The documents of this description which you will be called
upon to discuss are of more than fugitive importance, and should
not be weighed in a spirit of mere slavish submission to party consi-
derations.
I trust you will fathom and get to the bottom of certain disagree-
able incidents connected with our Navy.
You will know how to spell Mobilization and Localization before
the labours of our busy Bee are ended.
I implore you to settle the vexatious Burials Bill question. The
prospect of another recess, with its clerical controversies and corre-
spondence, its meetings of unwise clergy and imprudent laity, is too
terrible. Let us try, fi we can bury nothing else, to bury the hatchet.
Either you or your successors will be forced to face the life and

death questions of Drink and Drinking. May yoxi be blessed with
wisdom to deal with them.
Local Taxation, Merchant Shipping, and other topics of pressing
importance will amply occupy your attention. I trust, therefore,
you will sternly discountenance personal squabbles, Hibernian
obstructiveness, and any attempt at intrusion and insolence on the,
part of a nuisance to which you were far too lenient last year.
Do not waste time at the Beginning of the Session; be concise and
to the point in your speeches; intelligible and straightforward in
your answers to questions; original in your quotations; think more
of vour country and less of your party; more of the Division bell
and less of the dinner ditto.
Assuring you of my intention at once to resume the ahronicle of
your triumphs and defeats, your blunders and successes, your sense
and your nonsense, in my illustrations and "Essence," I now
dismiss you to the labours of a Session, which I cannot conceal from
you must be of more than ordinary length, seeing this is Bissextile
or Leap Year, and that February will therefore have twenty-nine
instead of twenty-eight days.
CULINARY SCHOLARSHIPS.
"The Society of Arts lately founded five ccholurships entitling the holders
thereof to free instruction in the National ^Training School of .Cookery; and
these honours will be competed for on the 12th of this mouth at South
Kensington."
E believe we break no con-
fidence in stating that the
following were for some
reason omitted from the
questions to the candi-
dates:—
If the wages of a Cook
are £30 a-year, how much,
in addition, may she expect
as perquisites?
Supposing that you took

extra wages would you ask
for lighting yourown fires?
How many pounds of

State the market-price

table of its fluctuations
during the past twelve

Do you consider it is one
of the privileges of a Cook
to imitate in (Sunday dress

tress P
If you chanced to have a handsome cousin in the Police, what

"Ha. Puwcn, ever on the qui vice to pick up anything that -may be

to ME. MAcDoUGALL for his list of "Unanswered Questions," with
the motto, " Gutta carat lap/idem, non vi, sed s&pe cadendo," and

they are the moat disagreeable questions that the querist's know-
ledge of the sore or shady places in the past of the queried, or the
weak joints in their armour, personal or financial, can suggest.
Though the motive for asking such questions may, as a rule, be
questionable, still such curiosity may have its public uses; and Mr.
Punch, hoping that the method has not been patented, proposes, for
once, himself to apply it, in the hope thereby to elicit some informa-
tion of use to the public, and not as yet sought by MB.

ECONOMY IN A MESS!

THE following ac-
count of a iless-
Meetinp of the
129th Regiment of
the Line has found
its way into Mr.
Punch s letter -
box. Although the
name of the Bat-
talion in question
does not appear in
the Monthly Army
List, there is no
reason for doubt-
ing the accuracy of
a report so evi-
dently the outcome
oJF recent corre-
spondence in the
Public Press and
less recent Horse-
Guards' Regula -
tions.
Mess-Meeting
of the
1291/1 Regiment.
Present—LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TRIMMER (in the Chair); MAJOR
MILDMAN; CAPTAINS FASTBOY, DRAG, BUSKLN, and PLODD;
LIEUTENANTS SHODDY and CAPER; SUB-LIEUTENANT BANTAM;
•SURGEON PBOBANG.
After the roll of officers had been called by the Adjutant, the
Minutes of the last Meeting were read, approved, and confirmed-
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TRIMMER said that he had called a Meeting
of the Officers of the Regiment because he wished to take their opinion
upon the subject of Mess Expenses. In the olden time, the Mess
was considered private.—it was left to the Officers who had the
honour to command the Regiment (assisted by the Mess-Committee)
to regulate the customs and decide upon the uniform. Now-a-days
the Mess-jacket was a matter of sealed patterns, and he was directed
to see that no unnecessary _ expense should be incurred by the
Officers under his command in giving entertainments. He wished
to live in friendship and good-will with all his Officers, and he there-
fore called upon them to make any suggestion they pleased for his
information. Of course they would understand it was merely for
his information, as the Mess had now become a question of disci-
pline.
MAJOB MILDMAIT begged to call the attention of the Colonel to
the fact that Champagne was drunk at Mess contrary to the wishes
of the General commanding the district.
CAPTAIN FASTBOY wished to correct the Major. The General
objected to Champagne. He doubted if the liquor recently supplied
to the Mess under the name of Champagne really came within the
General's objection. It was more suggestive of gooseberries than
grapes.
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TRIMMER wished to know why Champagne
had been introduced after his orders to the contrary.
SUBGEON PROBANG explained that the General commanding the dis-
trict had dined with the Mess during the temporary absence of the
Colonel. The General commanding the district had ordered the
Champagne.
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TsJODtBR said that altered .the matter.
Evidently the intention of the General was not absolutely to forbid
the consumption of effervescing wine—what was commonly under-
stood by "fizz," in fact—but to put a stop to unnecessary display.
Under those circumstances the case might, perhaps, be met by
Champagne being drunk in future from China mugs in lieu oj
CAPTAIN BUSKIN would respectfully ask the Colonel if private
theatricals came under the heading of entertainments."
LlEUTENANT-CoLONBL TRIMMER (before answering the question]
would wish to know who took part in the theatricals.
CAPTAIN BUSKIN informed the Colonel that SURGEON PROBAXG
LIEUTENANT CAPER, and himself, were the leading members of the
troupe.
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TRIMMER was of opinion that, under these
circumstances, the theatricals could scarcely be considered as enter-
tainments.
LIEUTENANT CAPER respectfully requested to know whether the
Regjment might not occasionally give a ball to the resident gentry
The fact was the amateur theatricals recently given, which had been
•ery largely attended, had created a very unpleasant, and, he was
lound to say, erroneous impression in the neighbourhood. Hamlet
tad been played, he thougnt very well played—but the resident
gentry who had witnessed the performance insisted that there had
leen'an intention to burlesque SHAKSPEARE. Such an intention he
legged most energetically to repudiate, for himself and the other
members of the regimental corps dramatique.
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TRIMMER thought that perhaps, under the
special circumstances of the case, a ball might be given, but officers
must be put to no unnecessary expense. He would be glad to
receive suggestions.
MAJOR MILDJIAN would suggest that the band of the Regiment
should play quadrilles from eight until ten, and that tea and cake
should be qerved for ten minutes, in the ante-room, at half-past
nine.
CAPTAIN FASTBOY said that it would be absolutely necessary, to
>reserve the prestige of the Regiment, that a string band should bo
jrought down from Town, and that the supper should come from
GUNTER'S.
LIEUTENANT SHODDY thought that things ought to be-well done, if
hey were done at all. Five-pound bouquets should be provjded for
the Ladies. His father was ready to put down £2,000 to pay his
jroportion of the cost of doing things in style. "D—n the expense,"
was his motto.
LIEUTENANT-COLONEL TRIMMER begged to decline MR. SHODDY'S
offer. He did not think that MR. SHODDY had quite caught the
regimental spirit.
CAPTAIN PLODD could not help feeling that a ball was an unneces-
sary, as well as unsatisfactory, form of entertainment. A scientific
Conversazione would be infinitely better. For £50 he undertook to
purchase the materials for several most interesting illustrated
lectures on Electricity, the Spectroscope, Organic Chemistry, and
the Darwinian System of Evolution.
SUB-LIEUTENANT BANTAM, as. an officer of two months' standing,
thought that the Regiment would be utterly disgraced if they did
not give a good Ball at least once a quarter. Did not the glorious
rag ne had had the honour of carrying that morning for the first
time, record what the Regiment had done at Waterloo, the Alma,
and Inkermann? As to expense, he for one was quite sure his
widowed mother would send him an extra £10 note for so good a
purpose.
CAPTAIN DRAGS would like to know whether the Colonel wished
the Pack to be kept up?
The Colonel said certainly—at the same time he would like to see
more economy in its management, and had made a suggestion with
that view in his list of regulations, which he thought would meet
the exigences of the case all round. He had framed them with a
view to encourage good feeling and keep up the prestige of the
Regiment, while avoiding all unnecessary outlay, which, as their
Commanding Officer, it was his duty to discourage.
The Adjutant then read the following list:—
Mess.—Champagne and all other wines may be drunk, but in
mugs. The cAe^will send up the dinner (which will be of the usual
recherch£ description) on willow-pattern plates. Water decanters
will not be put on the table, as being an unnecessary expense. The
supply of salt and other condiments will jn future be carefully con-
trolled, with a view to the strictest economy.
Private Theatricals.—Stage costumes, professional coach, and hire
of rooms will remain as before. As it appears, however, that it has
been customary to pay ten boys at a shilling a head to g^o into the
gallery to applaud, a reduction is recommended under this heading.
In future only five boys will be sent into the gallery at tenpence a
head.
Ball.—Band and supper will come from London as heretofore.
No alterations will be made in the sums voted for hire of rooms,
floral decorations, &c. With a view to economy, however, the
riband attached to the pencils of the dance programmes will be of
common silk instead of twist gold-thread.
Pack.—In future, the man in charge of the dogs .will receive one
quart of beer, allowance, daily, instead of three pints,as heretofore.
After the reading of the above regulations, LIEUTENANT-COLONEL
TRIMMER thanked the Offiqers for their attendance, and the Meeting
was formally dissolved-
The Colonel, before leaving, intimated, however, that no great
reduction would be made in the Mess subscription of the 129th
Regiment, in spite of the above sweeping reforms.

A GRACE'S COUP DE GRACE?
ACCORDING to the London Correspondent of a local paper, the
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK has lately distinguished himself by saying a
sharp thing. In order to the repression of national intemperance:—
"The ARCHBISHOP OF YOKK cleared the ground for doing something when
a few days ago he gave the coup iff grace to the old blatant sophism ' You
can't make people sober by Act of Parliament,' and said 'But you are now
making them drunk by Act of Parliament.'"
This is clever, indeed. An Act of Parliament not only sanctions
public-houses, but also compels people to go and get drunk in them.
That is the case of the agitators for a Liquor Law. It isn't as
though the people could do as they chose, drink or not. That would
be simply reasonable and constitutional freedom. They are absolutely
forced to drink, and more than so, to get drunk, by Act of Parlia-
ment. Under what penalty? The ARCHBISHOP OF YORK will
perhaps tell us if it was really he, and not somebody of another
order of intellect, who, by the particularly brilliant saying with
which his Grace has been credited, so completely gave to the "old
blatant sophism" the "coup de grace " quoted as archiepiscopal.

LAWS03 AND LIBERTY!
A FEW evenings ago SIR WILFRID LAWSOX, "in connection with
the Temperance agitation," as a newspaper savs, "visited Ports-
mouth." There, at a public meeting in the Soldiers' Institute, he
delivered another of his funny speeches on the "Permissive Bill."
Referring to the feud raging between the Publicans and their rivals
the Grocers, he said:—
"The Grocers who held licences for the sale of intoxicating liquors were
about to be attacked. His hair stood on end when he rend the organs of the
Licensed Victuallers, to find what a bad account they gave of the Grocers.
(Laughter.) The Publicans accused the Grocers of every enormity because
they sold drink, which in their opinion ought to be sold and consumed only in
the public-house."
Having, amid " lottd laughter and applause," observed that in
this case the relations between the Pharisee and Publican in the
parable were reversed, the speaker went on to say that—
"He had a great respect for the ordinary Grocer, but ho had no respect for
the Grocer who sold intoxicating drink, and he would heartily help the Pub-
licans in driving the liquor-Selling Grocer out of the field, ifaving got rid of
him, however, he would join them in any movement against the Publicans."
For this fair warning that the "Permissive Bill" is intended not
only to put down public-houses, but also to restrict private persons,
Sin WILFRID LAWSOX deserves the thanks of every freeborn Briton
who values his freedom. In themeanwhile the conflicting Publicans
and Grocers will perhaps hnve sense enough to see how completely
they, in relation to o»e another, correspond to those famous com-
batants in the fable, the Frog and the Mouse, and with what exact-
ness the Kite hovering over them, that swooped down upon and
snapped up both together, is represented by the- United Kingdom
Alliance, personified in SIR WILFRID LAWSCX.

(An Appeal to MR. BRIGHT.)
No doubt the wise, Friend BRIGHT, with thee on Free Trade ground
who stand,
Must own that no impediment should clog the sale of land.
Consistency and logic this acknowledgment demand;
Yet feel'st thou not that something may be said, on the other hand,
For the fine Old English Gentleman, one of the olden time?
Imagine, JOHX, that for the last two centuries, or three,
Trade in respect of land had been from trammels wholly free;
Where now would all the large estates with their broad acres be,
Entailed at present upon heirs of ancient pedigree,
Like the nne Old English Gentleman, one of the olden time!'
Where the grey keeps and castles, the historic courts and halls?
The granges o'er whose gables lichen creeps, and ivy crawls,.
Whence nit the bats and owls as dark the shade of twilight falls?
Where the stately manor-houses, the time-worn, ancestral walls,
Of y6ur fine Old English Gentlemen, all of the olden time?
Thon know'st the ancient seat that bears a county name of mark,
The homestead nigh the rookery in avenue or park,
Whose annals were recorded by a grave and learned clerk,
That house where eery things are seen, say the neighbours, after
dark,
By its fine Old English Gentleman, 'Squire of the olden time.
The house that's full of wainseotting, and chests and coffers old,
And antique chairs and furniture, and mildew, moth, and mould;
Inside and out a picture, oh, how lovely to behold!
And where the Family Ghost appears before the death, we 're told,
Of the fine Old English Gentleman, still of the olden time:
Whence the Squire drives on Sundays to the Church, hedged round
with yew,
And through service sits with gravity and grandeur in his pew,
From which, by mien distinguished from the men of fortunes new,
He contemplates his scutcheon on the tablet full in view
Of that nnc Old English Gentleman, all of the olden time.
Canst thou not with him sympathise, Friend, canst thou not admire
The behaviour and belongings of this typical old 'Squire?
Would it not grieve thee were his Hall to be destroyed by fire?
Or the house and grounds to pass away to a base and alien buyer,
From that fine Old English Gentleman, one of the olden time?
'Tis sad enough already when, through cutting off entail,
A spendthrift is empowered to put his heritage up to sale;
How often and how sorely, and how vainly, we bewail
The good old mansions that have gone the way of the good old aid,
And the good Old English Gentlemen, 'Squires of the olden time!
NO MORE KNIFEBOYS!
A SHORT time ago Mu. BRIDOI!, at Wandsworth, and MS. CHAN'CE,
at Lambeth, decided, against the Commissioners of Inland Revenue,
that liability to the tax on male servants was not incurred bv the
occasional employment of a boy to do odd iobs. At Kingston, how-
ever, official zeal has been rewarded by obtaining from the Magis-
trates a conviction, with a mitigated penalty of five pounds, incurred?
by a Gentleman through having, without &• licence, employed a Lad'
daily for a few hours. He had previously given an old mhn the
sanrc employment, which kept him out of the workhouse.
Nothing of this sort can occur again; and the Commissioners off
Inland Revenue are further to be congratulated that the effect of
their public-spirited proceeding at Kingston has already been that
of causing numerous housekeepers to dismiss their boys. For of
course all these housekeepers will now, instead of boys, employ
regular footmen, or other male servants for whom they will be
chargeable with no more duty than they were liable to for the boys,
and of whose wages and keep the additional cost will be no object.
Tluis the Revenue will gain immensely; unless the appeal of which
the Defendant at Kingston has given notice should be decided in
his favour, and the Commissioners be unhappily ruled by the Court
above to have unduly, vcxatiously, and mischievously endeavoured
to press the law to the injury and annoyance of their neighbours.
New Rhyme for the Nursery.
THERE was an old woman, and whoi do jjou think?
She paid one and sixpence to skate-at a Rink;
A cropper she came, when she ventured to try it:
Oh, couldn't this foolish old woman keep quiet!

The Irrepressible Doctor was determined to have his Procession to the House, too—King Mob's

Side by side with Sra STAFFORD'S Bill to diminish Insurance

it is a sure sign that vou
will marry money. But
if a Love bird, then it is
absolutely certain that nei-
ther parents, nor guard-
ians, nor long absence, nor
limited means, nor the
high price of provisions,
will prevent you from
marrying the person who
is dearer to you than all
th,e world besides. A
Blackbird is a clear in-
dication that your husband
will be a Clergyman; a Redbreast, that he will be in the Army; a
Bunting, in the Navy; a,Goose, or a Booby, should warn you of
a want of intellectual qualities; a Duck will instinctively bring a
particular person to your recollection; and the sight of a pair of
Turtle Doves will make you blithe and happy for all the rest of
the day.
It is an undertaking fraught with considerable peril to send a
Valentine to a Ward in Chancery. Do not run the risk of fine and
imprisonment, unless you have fcrst obtained the written sanction,
Cperly stamped, of the LORD CHANCELLOR, or a Judge at Cham-
8. The document you propose to transmit must be filed in Court
at least fourteen days before the Fourteenth of February, accom-
panied by an affidavit-made before a Commissioner in Lunacy, that
the contents of the .valentine, if in MS., are your own original
composition, and that you have, at least^ fifteen hundred a year, or

expectations from two wealthy maiden aunts, who approve of the
match.
Whatever the prevailing coiffure may be, on this day it is indis-
pensable that vou should wear your hair in a true lover's knot.
In buying a Valentine to send to an adult, if you wish it to pro-
duce a favourable impression, the following precautions must be
strictly observed :—
1. Select a fine day in February for the purchase, when there is
no fog, and the wind is in the South-west, and there is blue
sky and sunshine, and the birds are singing on the trees.
2. Wear a Nosegay, composed of Bachelors' Buttons, Forget-Me-
Not, Heartsease, Love-in-idleness, Passion Flower, and
Speedwell.
3. Let every article of your dress be new, and worn on this occa-
sion for the first time. A Glossy Hat, a Blue Coat, with
brass buttons, White Waistcoat, Lavender Trousers, and a
Violet Scarf, present a tasteful and unobtrusive appearance.
4. Draw up to the door of the shop where you purpose making
your selection in a neat Brougham, or smart Victoria.
5. Take no change. If the Valentine you fix upon is priced
threepence, and you have only a sovereign in your purse,
beg the seller's acceptance of the balance. Any neglect of
this injunction, betraying, as it would, a mercenary spirit,
may lead to the destruction of your most cherished hopes.
G. Post your Valentino with your own hands, not in a Pillar-box,
not at a-Receiving-house, but at St. Martin's-le-Grand, "if
you live in London; if in the Country, then at the Head-
office. For greater security, you had better register the
packet; and be particular in inviting the attention of the
clerk to the nature of its contents.
If the first time you go out of doors on St. Valentine's morning,
you should meet the same person in the same spot and at the same
moment in three successive years, you will be guilty of a dereliction
of duty if you do not mention to her the subject which is nearest to
your heart, and press for a favourable reply before post-time.
This being Leap-Year, there can be no objection, as an excep-
tional occurrence, to a Lady sending a Valentine to a Gentleman;
but she must first consult all her maternal female relatives, who are
unmarried and above forty years of age, on the propriety of the step,
and afterwards submit the Valentine itself to the family lawyer,
who will take Counsel's opinion upon it, if thought advisable.

Extracts from his Journals and Correspondence, and Portrait, is

we need not wonder it

burning questions of
how the strap of the

to have been set at rest
for ever. Mr. Punch
heartily congratulates
the DUKE OP CAM-
BRIDGE upon the cpm-
pletion of his arduous
labours, and trusts that
he will be equally suc-
cessful with the twin

not critical; and, ac-

SOBRIETY OT SCOTLAJTD.
Lsr a lately published Parliamentary paper, the number of persons,
during the year ended the 30th of last June, arrested in Scotland
for drunkenness was 61,173. "Drunk and incapable," 38,213.
"Drunk and disorderly," 22,960. And have Scotchmen still the
cheek to sing " We are na fou, we 're nae that fou?"
CLERICAL INTELLIGENCE.
ATB. meeting of High Churchmen for discussion of the Burials
Bill, the REVEREND T. HUGO is reported, in the Church Times, to
have spoken thus :—
"With regard to the grievance the Clergy felt at being the national undcr-
Uters, it was one he felt in no small degree. It was an intolerable wrong
Mat a man who was excommunicated had a right to come to the Clergy to be
buncd. But there was a greater grievance. No doubt every Dissenting
Minister had his black sheep, and, when the hand of death fell on them, he
might refuse to inter those black sheep; the alternative being that the Clergy
would have to bury them, and so they would not only have the reprobates of
their own congregations, but all the carrion of dissent to bury, which accord-
ing to law, might be turned over to them."
"The carrion of dissent!" What a pretty figure of speech for n
(lergyman to utter! How this "snowy-banded, delicate-handed"
Gentleman must shrink from the idea of being a "national under-
taker, and^ how tightly he must hold his nose the while he reads
the Burial Service over some black sheep of a Dissenter!
After using more strong language than we feel inclined to quote,
the Reverend—very Reverend—speaker thus concluded :—
"With the exception of a few here and there, Dissenters were chiefly
remarkable for impudence, ignorance and stupidity; and dissent w*s below
contempt as regarded its intcllr. tunl position. It was a base thing, and as
long as Churchmen kept it down under them, so long would there be happiness
iind blessedness in England."
Hard words break no bones, or the dissenting body would be
found in a sore plight after such a speech as this. England must
indeed feel happy and blessed in the thought that, she possesses
such a champion as this Churchman, ever ready to defend her from
the Dragon of Dissent.
HARD MEASURE.
FROM a statement circulated by ME. G. S. MEASOM, a member of
the Orphanage Working School Committee, it appears that the
"Joseph Soul Testimonial," raised in recognition of Mu. SOUL'S
services as Secretary to that charity and others, was not a payment
made directly to MR. Son. himself, but was a sum of money
(£1,337 lls. 6rf., less necessary expenses) invested for the benefit of
MRS. SOUL and her daughter.
It, further appears, however, that a Committee of the Orphan
Working School had generously awarded to ME, SOUL, on his
retirement from office, a pension equal in amount to his full salary.
benefit by ME. MEASOX without consultation with any member of
the Committee "—which MR. MEASOJI denies.
Here, surely, there is some mistake. All kinds of governing and
legislative bodies comprise little-minded members, actuated chiefly
by a sense of self-importance—nearly all the sense they have. Some
of them, under a show of zeal for economising corporate funds, are
apt, on opportunity, to indulge a predilection for reducing another
man's income. Doubtless, the majority of the Orphanage Working
School's " General Court" is not composed of that kind of constitu-
ents; and, if it has been betrayed into inflicting a disappointment
and an unmerited hardship on a worthy SOUL, will lose no time in
rescinding a harsh resolution.
SIR,
"Credat Judeeus!"
THERE was a Sermon in behalf of the Society for Promoting
Christianity amongst the Jews in our Parish Church last Sunday.
Walking home with my family afterwards, my eldest son (a very
hopeful young man, as you may guess) asked me what I eoasidered
the greatest difference between Jews and Christians.
I answered that I knew of no other differences between them save
ihose of nationality and religion. To which he replied—
"Oh, yes, there is another very great difference. Christians take
much interest at the Jews, and Jews take much interest out nf the
Christians."

THE DEFENCE OF HACKNEY DOWNS.
CERTAIN markings and earrings on the face of Nature are
popularly ascribed to the Evil One. A dell in a certain Down is
named The Devil's Punchbowl." On. Hackney Downs, also, there
is an excavation which will, perhaps, one day bear the same title.
Possibly it mfcy likewise be called AMHURST'S Hollow. A Circular,
bearing the signature of MK. JOHN DE MORGAN, alleges that, not-
withstanding the Metropolitan Commons Acts of 1866 and 1872,
forbidding enclosure of or encroachment on any Metropolitan
Common,— •• . •• • .
"MR. TYSSBK AMHORST, the Lord, or one of the Lords, of the Manor, in
1874, enclosed two pieces of Common) Land on Hackney Downa and North
Mill Field; and at the same time opened a large pit (now measuring 190 feet
by 90 feet, and a depth of about eight feet), from which gravel has been taken
and aold, to the great injury of the pasturage of the Common."
Now the enclosure and excavation" of public land may be regarded
as the work of a public enemy, so .nearly resembling the Enemy of
Man as to make any hole he might illegally dig alike and equally fit
to be called the devil's or his.own. MB. DE MORGAN contends that
the pit above-mentioned was dug, and that the fences were erected
on Hackney Common against the Law. • Accordingly, he says,—
"I, at the invitation of the Commoners, after careful study, advised the
removal of the fencei erected on Hackney Downs. In the presence of 60,000
people, the Commoners asserted their right, on December llth."
For which exploit the bold Commoners and their dauntless
Champion have been immortalised; modesty alone prevents Mr.
Punch saying how—besides, everybody knows. Of course MR. DE
MORGAN was prepared for the consequences. He thus relates
them :—
"Immediately an action was commenced against me, at the instance of the
Lord of the Manor, for damages, and for an injunction to restrain from further
proceedings."
A Committee of Commoners on the part of MR. DE MORGAN have
instituted a cross action against the Lord of the Manor. The case
has come before the Master of the Rolls; litigation is still pending;
the parties on either side having mutually undertaken in the mean-
while to hold their hands, the Lord of the Manor from setting up
any more fences, or digging any other holes, and the Commoners
from removing any extant fences, until the case shall have been
heard. But encroaching Lords of Manors are not to bo fought
without money. Subscriptions can be sent either directly to MR. DE
MORGAN, or to his Solicitor, MR. E. KIMBER, 22, Queen Street,
Cheapsidc. He and.his valiant Commoners want them to carry on the
war. A Public that 'values its own Open Spaces will doubtless
respond liberally to the following appeal:—
"For the sake of the health of the poor living in overcrowded houses, for
the sake of preserving the natural powers of your children, by providing for
them a playground. I appeal for funds. A balance-sheet will be published at
the close of the tight."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"OUR REPRESENTATIVE" JN INDIA.
(True, full, and Particular Account of a Great Tiger Hunt, showing "How it
is done")
KAE SIR.
I SHALL give
it all up. I -won't
play any more. I
shall chuck up the
sponge, and return.
I've nad a row with
SIR JAK'HOLXAR—
the Holkar — who
can't stand a joke.
The Holkar is not
a Jokar. He will
wear a European
hat, which doesn't
suit his native Tog-
garee (civilian's cos-
tume on ordinary
occasions), and so
at Jeypore I got a
lot of little Tattees
(a sort of native
street-boy) to run
after him, and
shout, "Who's
yourMahr-hatta?"
He was wild, and came to complain to my Noble and Princely Companion. I
could not help overhearing their conversation, as they were in the next room to
me, which LETAH DORAJAH, our head Butler, had just quitted, forgetting, as
he invariably does, fermer la porte behind him. You know the proverb about
listeners? Well, I was obliged to step in and have it out with the Holkar, who
finished by weeping copiously, lint—my Noble Friend was short with me.
For the first time—-and mind you—for tide last. We made it up before dinner
over a. glass of Chowrie (a kind of barley-water, with slices of Indian pickle in
it, sei-red like cup), and a fragrant IJar^nuaulah (something between a 'Pick-
wick' and a ' Vevey Fin') out of my own private cigar-case.*
When this cloud had cleared off,'my Noble Sportsman wanted to have a shot
at a tigerjln fact, to see some real fun, with a spice of danger in it. The truth
is, he had been excited by,' my accounts of how in former y«ars (Aii! how
little did I then think I should revisit the scenes of my youth in such distin-
guished company) 1 had traced the monarch of the forest to his lair, had
wrestled; with him single-handed in the jungle, had given hwn his coup de
grace all among the pampas, and how, armed only with a Musmtd (a kind of
light walking-canet), I had tickled a tiger like a trout, till I bagged him.
"Mon Prince," said I, for he wouldn't be gainsaid, " you simil have your
tiger."
B-R-SF-RD, C-R-GT-N, W. H. R-6S-LL, S-TH-BL-HT, and all of 'em, came
up to me.
"Don't let him risk anything!" they cried.
"Leave it to n*«," I replied, and then I gave them my plan. It was simple,
and succeeded to admiration. I got a fine bullock, had him killed, steeped in
rum, and then drove out into the jungle. Sure enough, true to his unerring
instinct, the finest Bengal tiger I have ever seen came bounding up to where
the carcase lay, with myself concealed in the high grass behind it. The
splendidibeast made a dinner for a month olf the dainty provided for him,
and, of course, the rum utterly fuddled him. When he was sufficiently far
gone.to render all chance of his going any farther highly problematical, I slipt
my lasso round his neck, led him quietly down the hill, and tied him up in a
large old forty-gallon cask, which I had taken the precaution to have placed
there for the purpose. Then I sent messengers into the town with the news,
and presently out came my Noble Sportsman and the Suite in carriages, armed
to the teeth. I could not help laughing in my sleeve. However, the natives
did the thing in style. They erected a wooden tower, into which my Royal
Companion could climb, and from which he could shoot at his ease—or,.I should
* As Our Correspondent intimates hia intention of speedily returning, we have decided
upon waiting for his arrival, in order to obtain suoh explanations of Indian •words as we
iannot find in our own Indian Dictionary. At present, in default of better information, we
can only inform our readers that the usually accepted interpretation of Haremeadah is not
any sort of cigar, hut " a savage;" that Chowrie, of which he professes to 'have had a glass,
is a "Fly-flapper, formed of the tail of a Thibet cow, and only used by persons of high
tank;" and the Tattee, whioh he explains to be "a sort of street-boy," is "a screen of
glass placed in a window, and cooled by water." Mayna est veritm! We break off sud-
denly. • A Telegram has just reached us, from a person in whom we have every confidence,
informing us that a person, bearing a striking resemblance to our itppresentatire, and a. Hoy
with a liifi/e book, have just been seen on the pier at Gravesend. The Boy, by the descrip-
tion, seems to be our missing link. We hare telegraphed back "Spare no expense. Follow
them, and bring them to justice, whatever it may cost you." Perhaps, before this number
is published, we shall be in possession of further and more certain details. At present, all

this end 1—ED.
say, shoot at his tiger—for 1 suppose that a man shooting at
his ease, would intend to kill tune, whatever he aimed a1.
When all was prepared, I undid the cord, and pulled
the tiger's tail, but he wouldn't wake—he was sleeping
off the fumes of the rum. Two buckets of water did the
trick, when he arose with a low growl, and gave me a
side-glance of intense dislike. But, fortunately, as a boy.
I had picked up the secret of pacifying these brutes, and
it stood me in good stead on this occasion. He came out
of the tub, looked about, yawned, and then, pulling him-
self together, began quietly trotting homewards towards
his native jungle. Another tug of his tail from me sent
him off towards the Royal box. whence he was very soon
saluted with two or three shots that immensely as-
tonished him. He gave one roar, bounded off, and dis-
appeared, much to the disappointment of the gentlemen
in the wooden tower. But, knowing his route, I took a
short cut, and met him as he was turning the corner.
With all the concentrated fury at his command, he
sprang on me, but, luckily, remembering that sort of
Pantomime trick which Indian hunters practise, I passed
underneath him as he bounded over me, caught him by
the tail, which brought him heavily to the ground, and
then with an air-pistol, so that the report might not
reach Somebody's ears, I settled accounts with Mr. Tiger.
Then I carefully inserted a bullet in the beast's heart,
and ran back, shouting and holloaing^ to the Noble and
Distinguished Party. What was their delight at seeing
the Splendid Animal dead as mutton! The question
was, Who killed Cvck Robin f" The answer was
soon forthcoming. One of the natives, stooping, found
in the Tiger's heart a bullet, which, being handed round
(like the shoe in Cinderella), to find out to whom it
belonged, was at last discovered to fit exactly the bore of
His Royal Highness's rifle.'!
Come, Sir, wasn't that worth five thousand a-year and
a baronetcy r I believe you. my Bhoy! But where is
gratitude in this world? Hymns are actually being
composed and sung in honour of the Tiger Slayer; and
no deed has done more for the future of India than this,
the fame of which will raise my Noble and Amiable
Companion to the highest pinnacle on which Indian
reverence can place him. And yet—shall auld acquaint-
ance be forgot 7
I must finish up this in haste, having been just called
in to join in our evening Spelling-Bee, over our cup of
Kaffy. They put too much Shikkaree in the Kaffy here.
However, as it's in the next tent, I must throw my
Suwarree loosely round my throat, and run in.
JiuuiUM BBS has just come in, to ask us to lend him
two rupees, to put on at Sagheecha * (a sort of Blind
Hookey). IBRAHIM BEG belongs to an ancient family,
but he's always cadging, and he doesn't pay when he
wins. I 'm off.

SUFFOCATION AND SCIENCE.
THE atmosphere of the Lecture Theatre of the Royal
Institution is remarkable for containing a very large ex-
cess of carbonic acid gas, when, as usual on Frid"ay evening
meetings, those who breathe it are numerous. Hence, the
Albemarle Street rendezvous of philosophers cannot be
crowded, without being, literally,tcrammed to suffocation.
The representative of the Medical Press and Circular
notes, tnat during PROFESSOR HUXLEY'S lecture there the
other night, Ladies were led out fainting, and states that
he was himself almost obliged to retire by the stifling
nature of the air under the gallery. An attempt made
to open the ventilators set PROFESSOR HUXLEY sneezing,
and nearly made him shut up. Ventilation has ever
been notoriously defective, and the air loaded with
noxious gas^at the Royal Institution. Its theatre when
filled is as fit for a lecture-room as the Grotto del Cane—
fit to stupefy everybody in it. and send even the hearers
of PROFESSORS HUXLEY and TYNBALL to sleep. Yet the
Royal Institution is the very Temple of Chemical Science.
Here is another parallel to the case of the shoemaker's
wife; always the worst shod woman in the parish—isn't
she?

Dearth, of Army Doctors.
THE papers report a grievous lack of candidates for
;he commission of Medical Officer in the Army. Private
practice is lucrative to few but the most eminent Phy-
sicians and Surgeons. Anything like adequate pay and
a. position on a fair footing with combatant Officers
surely might be expected to attract at least a suffi-
siency of Army Surgeons. These attractions have yet to
>e tried.
STEEN TEUTHS.
DEAR ME. PUNCH,
Nor having had an opportunity of laying my -views before
the PRIME MINISTER the other day, I send you a brief note of what

tained in consequence of his impertinent meddling. Because one
Fourth of a crew of sixteen object to be drowned, are they to prevent
twelve other honest and daring fellows from risking their lives, as
British Seamen ought always to be ready to do at the call of duty,
[t is perfectly monstrous!
It is true that one or two of my ships have occasionally sailed
•ather deep in the water, and that one did go down not long after
eaving port. But in this case it was solely because the Captain
lad foolishly forgotten to allow for the weight of the crew, who
mly shipped at the last moment—the carpenter and boatswain
jeing exceptionally heavy men.
Then, as for saying that Seamen are, as a rule, dissatisfied with
heir ships, it is all moonshine. The Sailor's attachment to his ship
s, on the contrary, proverbial. Why, it was only the other day
i man fell overboard from one of my own ships. Did he swim
away from it? No, he immediately endeavoured to climb on board
again, and expressed the highest satisfaction when he found him-
self once more among his messmates. Instances of this kind are
numerous.
With regard to want of proper comfort and accommodation, all I
can say is that I don't believe there is a single bunk in all my
^essels in which the stoutest Sailor could not turn without coming
i contact with the top planking. What do you say to that,
Mr. Punch?
There are only two more points upon which I need trouble you;
and they are so insignificant, that I must apologise for mentioning
them.
The frequency of casualties has been much spouted about by
PI.IHSOLL AND Co. I simply remark, "Pooh!" Do not accidents
happen on land P Did not my own daughter tread on a piece of
orange-peel the other day, and twisted her foot, so that she could
not skate for a week? And as to a case, lately much commented on
by a scandal-loving Press, in which one of my ships came into port
with eighteen out of twenty disabled by sijurvy, if you only knew
the trouble a Captain has to get his men to take the slightest pre-
cautions, and their rooted prejudice against lime-juice and other
antiscorbutics, you would, I am sure, agree with me that the
owner'is the last person to be made responsible for what is, after
all, only a form of disease, and mysterious, like all diseases.
Scurvy is, no doubt, an unpleasant complaint; so is the gout:
I "ve got a touch of'it myself now. So you see, Mr. Ptmch, there is
not the slightest occasion for all this agitation; and all I can say
is, that if I am to be interfered with in my business, it will end in
my being unable to clear a living profit, and cutting the concern
altogether, at whatever cost to the country. I have only expressed
in this letter what I know to be the private views of others of my
class.
If you want to see what a jolly, contented dog the British Seaman
really is, come and spend a week aboard my yaoht, and believe me
to be,
Yours, indignantly,
A SHIPOWNER.

A GUINEA FOR JACK'S HOSPITAL.
MONEY is wanted to extend the efficiency of one of the noblest of
our national charities—the most expressly national indeed of them
all, yet at the same time more'thari national. That is, dear friends,
the Seamen's Hospital, late the Dreadnought, at Greenwich, open not
only to British Seamen who need laying up for repairs, hut likewise
to Seamen of all nations requiring to go into dock. To the funds of
this excellent and sorely-needed Institution the Goldsmiths', the
riothworkers', the Saddlers', the Mercers', the Drapers', the
Skinners', the Vintners', the Salters', and, last, not least, the
Worshipful Merchant Taylors' Company, have liberally subscribed
—the latter to a donation of £31 10s. having added a grant of free
admission to their Convalescent Institution at Bognor, which has
accordingly received many patients from the Seamen's Hospital
during the past year.
However, the support of Jack's Hospital concerns not only the
City and Port of London, but every Port in England—indeed every
Port and Harbour all over the world. It is itself a Universal Har-
bour of Refuge. In their fifty -fifth annual Report, just published
—a pretty little blue book—the Managing Body of the Seamen's
Hospital Society apprise all whom it concerns—that is, everybody
—that, for reasons which see:—
"The Committee ask the Public to come forward, and increase the amount
received in annual subscriptions from £2000 to £5000, and then, if on an
nverage £50 annually be received from each port that sends patients to the
Hospital in the coune of the year, the Society will be established on a sound
national bams."
This appeal is now made known to the world at large by the one
periodical which can truly boast a world-wide circulation.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
so locutus est! And when either Leo or Bos Britannicut has
spoken, there is an end of discourse and discussion. (Monday,
Feb. 14.) Leo has spoken on the Suez Canal purchase, and, how-
ever obliged he may be to the CHANCELLOB OF THE EXCHEQUEB
for his explanations, and to the Head and Members of Her
Majesty's Opposition for their critical analysis thereof, he is
satisfied with his share—the Lion's share—in the venture, and
that is (as set forth in this week's Cartoon) no less than his
Indian Street-door Key. Whether the purchase be a good invest-
ment or bad of our four millions, by interest measure, that is not
the measure to be applied to this transaction. There is a high
policy measure, as well as an interest measure,
in which the scale is marked—not by nominal
L(ibra;), S(olidi), D(enarii)—but by national
C(redit), S(afety), and H(onour). By that
measure Ministers demand, and rightly de-
mand, to have this purchase gauged. And
with British Lion and British Bull at their
backs, they may confidently face the criticism
of the Opposition, in the adjourned debate
this day week, for which LOBD HABTINGTON
and MB. GLADSTONE reasonably pressed, and
which MB. DISBAELI wisely conceded.
Tuesday.—SIB WILLIAM FBAZEB attacked
the "ParochialSystem" of Local Metro-
politan Government, and thereby laid him-
self open to sundry "counters"—but more
for slips in words than facts—from LOCKE,
LUSK, and HOGG. London is now mis-
governed, not by its beadles, but by its
Jidiles; not by "porochial" Bumbles, but
by District Boards and Vestries, which com-
bine in a smaller cluster of big bodies most
of the faults of the huge congeries of lesser
bodies they have absorbed. LUSK uttered the
pious wish that those who found fault with
the existing vestrymen, had to look after the
street-sweeping, the dust-carts, and the nui-
sances themselves. Fancy SIB W. FRAZEB
transformed from Apollo to Hercules—turned
from translating Tasso to cleansing the
Augean Stable of London! SIB J. HOGG said
a good word—not undeserved—for the Metro-
politan Board, which has now finally passed
from the stage of Words to that of Works.
But more is needed for London than the great mind of even the Metropolitan Board can compass. We want to see jEdileship brought
down from such heroic tasks as Embankments and Viaducts to the humbler duties of the scavenger's cart and the domestic dust-bin.
No doubt the Wen is a big one to deal with, but it wants doctoring sadly. If CROSS would take up his London, London would take
up its CROSS, and set him on a higher pinnacle than he ever will reach by even the regulation of Licensed Victuallers', houses and
the improvement of Artizans' Dwellings.
ME. HUBBAED is going to set the law as to Crossed Cheques on its right end again, from which it has been rudely toppled by the rude hands
of the Judges in MILLS and SMITH. Don't check the use of crossed cheques whatever you do! There is nothing prettier to look at than the

narrow majority of 101 to 94 for Second Reading of MR. RATHBONE'S Bill empowering Corporations to grant superannuation allowances—
with due precautions against local jobs. Old public servants in municipal employments should be much obliged to MB. HANKEY—
who pointed out that pensions are only a form of deferred salary, on which principle they are .paid by the Bank of England—and to
MB. CROSS, who supported the Bill. ME. BASS opposes it. Bitter beer is tonic, and braces up men s nerves to do hard things.
Wednesday.—WALTER SAVAGE LANDOB used to boast his own short and simple plan for increasing the efficiency of the Episcopate.
"Give every Bishop £600 a year, and make it death to leave his diocese." ME. BEBESFOBD HOPE, in his scheme of episcopal im-
provement, takes another line. Private persons are to be at liberty to endow, and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners to cut and carve,
new Bishoprics out of existing dioceses—subject to the approbation of ttueen in Council and Parliament assembled.
Everybody—who wants Bishops at all—wants more of them. The Bench, as it is, is over-diocesed and over-worked. The flocks—
black sheep and other—are certainly not easier to rule now than in old times, and the shepherds and crooks at work now are no more than
when HENRI THE EIGHTH was King, and population counted by hundreds, where it is now reckoned by thousands.
But nobody—neither SIR W. BABTTELOT, nor MB. MONK, nor MB. MOWBBAT, nor MR. DILLWTN, nor MB. HENLEY, nor MR.
WALPOLE, nor MR. CROSS,—much as we may want more Bishops, approves MR. HOPE'S machinery for making them. And so HOPE—
spes fon$ra—was obliged to accept an adjournment of his Bill to the Greek Calends—alias July 26.
Thursday (Lords).—LORD CARNARVON, after apologies for a very bad cold, gave an elaborate explanation of the motives which
had led the Government to entertain favourably propositions for an exchange or our possessions on the Gambia against French pos-
sessions on the Gold Coast. No wonder an explanation made with such a cold was rather coldly received. LORD CARNARNON makes a
very good case, but their Lordships want further information. And so should the country. There ought to be very strong reasons
indeed for giving up the command of a river navigable for 440 miles by 100-ton craft, and so leaving us ten degrees of African
coast without any station but a tiny island off one of the mouths of the Niger.
(Commons.)—The Nasmyth Hammer at work. A brisk fire of questions on all sorts of subjects, from Snow in the streets to Slave-
Trade Legislation. Inter alia, knife-cleaning boys (so the CHANCELLOR op THE EXCHEQUER informs us) serving many masters are
not to be taxable as men-servants ; but knife-cleaning boys with one master, are. Let all who keep a boy to clean their knives see forth-
with that he finds somebody else's knives to clean, or send him about his business. Also, we are glad to learn from MR. HABDY that
the indecent practice lately prevailing in the Eoval Artillery Barracks at Aldershot of lodging four families in one room without screens,
or even curtains, to separate them, is at once to be put an end to. But why four families in one room at all? If a certain proportion
of married men is allowed in the Army, surely there ought to be proper provision for that proportion in all barracks—witn its own
room, at the least and lowest, for. each family.

DULL is an essay on the Vatican,
Even by GLADSTONE written; dull the day
When nought save fog in street and square you scan,
And e'en policemen fail to find their way;
Dull is KENEALT, that prodigious man;
Dull is the fierce Home-Ruler's blatant bray;
Greatly I fear—how sad is the confession!—
We 're settling down to a most dreary Session.
Look at the PREMIER'S countenance of lassitude!
Might he not be a worn-out, weary Sphinx,
Gazing o'er deserts dim of Tory crassitude,
Where from Wit's fount no weary traveller drinks?
If with Lavater-lens you tried to glass it, you 'd
Discern that chiefly of repose he thinks:
Itoi faineant he, who finds it a relief
That hostile hordes have lost their mightiest Chief.
That Chieftain, who of yore for battle lusted,
And hurled invective s jayelin swift and straight,
Being by many followers mistrusted,
Quietly bowed to the decree of Fate.
We know not if his bright sword, still unrusted,
Will starlike shine again in hot debate,
Or if, heroic shade, he means to dwell
Henceforth in HOMEB'S field of asphodel.
Dull are the Chiefs, the followers duller still,
Dullest of all the great financial topic:
For down the steep inevitable hill
Egypt descends, and we, with philanthropic
Ardour, waste millions to pJevent a spill.
Creditors' chances shrink to microscopic.
And when the crash comes, 'twill be found, I fear,
PHABAOH was not the last lost Charioteer.

WHY THIS THtlSNESS?
THERR is surely »omelhing—shall we say "high "—not to put it
coarsely—in the State—we may call Denmark—supposing such
social contrasts as the following to be of everyday occurrence. There
are noble and elevating thoughts, no doubt, associated with the • ex-
pression "a Paternal Government," but somehow that paternity
shows itself usually in the castigation of illiterate babies, and the
petting of well-educated sons ana daughters who ought to know
better. Judge for yourselves.
One Sunday afternoon last week HODOE, PATrand BILL (JuimrDGE,
resisting the temptations held out to them by sleeps-compelling par-
sons, repair to a neighbouring stream, where their low tastes and
sinful tendencies tempt them to throw chrps into the current. Not
content with thus desecrating the day, they continue thoir nefarious
proceedings, adding the further crime of backing one chip to pass
unothcr in their short race to the village bridge. At tfeis plebeian
amusement they stake several pence, and coppers change hands
freely. The Paternal one has its eye on t/hem, hewever, and BILL,
PAT, amd HODOE are walked off by tne Police to the nearest station.
One afternoon, a few days later, while BILL and his corn-
pampas in crime are engaged in an interesting ^conversation with the
magistrates, Frrz. HUSH, and GKRALD May be observed at the
window of the Holy Alliance Club, Piccadilly, watehing with intense
eagerness the horses attached to cab, cart, brougham, or omnibus as
they pass along the thoroughfare.

"I '11 do ditto," says Frrz, who has seen four grey dray-horses
pass, and feels he must win.
Chestnuts, browns, and a bay, aad ninthly a General Omnibus
•with two whites to the fore.
HUGH pockets his hundred, and they retire to the card-room,
where they remain, with an interval for dinner, till four o'clock the
next morning. GERALD has lost a couple of thou., which ho hasn't
got', and Frrz has recouped himself with an agreeable surplus, of
which we hope a few sovereigns will find their way into the pockets
of HODGE, PAT, and BILL.
In the Drawing-room and Kitchen next door may be noticed by
any Asmodeus like ourselves another and equally edifying contrast.
Down-stairs a very snuffy old w»man, with a walnut-juice resem-
blance to a gipsy, is promising, witk the aid of a greasy pack of torn
cards and a sediment of tea-leaves, all sorts of honours, titles, and
fortune to poor little MART ANNE HOUSEMAID, for the large sum of
one silver sixpence and a pound or two of kitchen stuff. While
MARY ANNE is gazing with r-ivdulous delight on the propitious Sibyl,
a Paternal agent steps down through the area-gate, which is wide
open, and kindly offers an arm of escort to the snuffy pseudo-gipsy,
for whom lodgings have been prepared in Queer Street.
In the Drawing-room above sits MRS. REGINALD COL KVEAL, with
six or eight friends, who have invited the celebrated American
Medium, JABEZ M. POSTOB, to join their circle, in hopes of eliciting
revelations of the Future from such condescending spirits at> may
happen to listen to their call. The shutters are closed, the little
fingers of the Illuminati are linked round a large table, on which a
tambourine is already beginning to tap out the names of the return-
ing ghosts and the destinies of the inquirers. This masculine
Sibyl has nothing snuffy about him, wears a faultless evening dress,
and several diamond* on his fingers. It would be downright rude-
ness and want of tavoir-virre u the Paternal Governor interfered
with him—but at the game time we confess to a weak pity for the
gipsy, and a strong desire to let off PAT and HODGE aforesaid.
To the Government we simply repeat—Why this Thusness•?
RINKO MANIA.
E believe we break no
confidence in publishing
the news that the atten-
tion of Parliament will,
shortly be called to the
prevalent epidemic, and a
Royal Commission, in all
probability, appointed to
inquire into the causes
which have led to the
mania for Ranking, to
consider the effects it
is producing on society,
and to report if any, and
what steps may be ad-
visable to check its rapid
progress, H«w exten-
sively the mania is spread-
ing on all sides may be
gathered froni a rlance at
the columns of advertise-
ments, which, besides in-
viting notioo to the rinks
already started, announce
a myriad of new skating
clubs in progress, or in
prospect. That the mania
has extended from the

SANSCULOTTES AT LIMERICK.
IT is not often that an Irishman can be twitted with what other
Irishmen might call Seotch economy. But the Cork Examiner
reports a suggestion on the part of certain members of the Corpora-
tion of Limerick, not only in respect of caution and economy, but
also as relative to a matter of clothing, specially Caledonian. At a
late meeting of one of the Limerick Corporation Committees, the
Mayor presidingj MR. CONNOLLY, of the firm of JOHN CONNOLLY AND
SON, the municipal tailors, attended to submit for acceptance the
new clothing which had been ordered for the Night Watchmen;
when
"ALDERMAN CLEARY said be heard a member alongside observe on the
impropriety of supplying Watchmen with trousers; for, if they dismissed u
Wul i'l11n,(ii. the question arose how would they get the |roue«ca off-hi<a if i li<'

trousers,"
"It's ill takin' the breeks aff a Highlandman." This T»an?-
Tweedian adage might, had the colleagues of the two gentlemen
abovenamed adopted their ideas, have become as applicable to the
Night Watchmen of Limerick as it is to the Gael. The Watch
would perhaps have had to be neoonstituted, and the Corporation to
advertise for recruits, notifying, although in Ireland, ttiat "No
Irish need apply." The suits of Limerick/8 Nipht WartcW«n would
then have suited none but Scotchmen. A uniform consisting of a
hat, coat, and cape, and no tronsera, would for its complement have
really required a kilt. The expedient wherewith BJLtAN O'LSTNN
supplied any deficiency in his wardrobe is no longer practicable.
Sheepskins are too costly for that now. As a lay of a Limerick
Night Watchman, Brian CfLynn would hftve needed to be sung
with a difference, somewhat after this fashiom :-*-
"BRIAN O'LYNN, wanting trousers to wear,
Joined the Limeciok Night Watch in hopes, of a pair;
Which when he found out he would not De founo in,
''Twill be mighty cool walldny s»y» BRIAN O'Lvvsr."
The "songs of other days" included one iii \«hich a pretty picture
was presented to the mind's eye by a couplet in glorification of—
"PADD-VWBACK just come from Cork,

"It was no longer the interest of the State,—at least to nothing like the
extent it was some years ago—to interest itself in the multiplication of
Enclosures. They must now rather consider Enclosures as schemes for private
improvement, the State seeing that the public interest did not suffer by the
Enclosures. . . . They must take into consideration that which the people of
this country wanted almost as much as food,—the air which they breathed,
and the health which they enjoyed. . . . The Government had thought it
right to make every encroachment on a village green a public nuisance, and
to enable any one to proceed against the person so offending."—MH. Ciioss,

BRATVO. MB. CROSS, Sir! Plain speaking at last,
Worth columns on columns of roundaboutation.
Such " improvement" may go it a trifle too fast
For the temper and taste of a trade-ridden nation.
The City must spread with the spreading of man—
That's the law of our life, and'twere folly to ban it;
But we don't want to see every trace of old Pan
Improved off the face of our planet.
Too plainly we feel that the chimney and wheel—
Twin symbols of Modern Mechanical progress—
Stretch sway every day. "We may fume a good deal
Against Trade, the omnivorous Octopus-Ogress,
Whose far-reaching tentacles mesh us all round.
Yet we know she at least is a sort of Step-mother.
But must we give up every acre of ground
To the demons of Shindy and Smother?
We have yielded too much to Utility's clutch,—
That one-eyed Utility, Duneedom s pet idol—
Forgetting the use of such matters as touch
The health or the heart. We may well put the bridle
On Selfishness rampant, most hard-mouthed of nags,
Who all public interest rough-shod rides over:
May well check old Mammon when plumping his bags
On the plea of some " right of estover.
Too long, under shield of too negligent law,
The insatiate ghoul hight Enclosure has nibbled
Those bits of green open, so sweet to his maw,
In defiance of all who have squabbled or scribbled:
He 'd prig from the poorest heath, common, or forest,
And laugh at the masses who toil and can't travel,—
Preferring to needs which are sure of the sorest
The profits from villas or gravel.
But on Wealth versus Health we are getting new views;
New measures of worth for our few Open Spaces:
All glimpses of Nature we dare not refuse
To the populous City's poor throngs of pale faces.
JOHN plainly means backing the weak 'gainst the strong:
Though the " rights" of the rich he's no wish to disturb, he
Intends to preserve for the labouring throng
Same sort of a poor Rut in Vrbe!
Here's a health to the few who have sturdily fought
In the cause which the many now take into favour.
The names of the nobs who such " pickings" have sought,
To the sense of to-day have a nauseous savour.
They will find, will these grudging earth-gobblers, whose greed
Would filch from the poor their few " Patches of Pleasure,"
The cry " No Short Commons!" means mischief indeed
When 'tis backed by shrewd men and sharp measure!

of true that Spelling Bees are all "Walker. The operation of

Where the mystic Ganges flows,
Where we English, unafraid,

THERE is reason to believe that the " Imponderables " are about

determined, bjr experiment, that Light at least is ponderable. At
the Royal Institution, the other Friday evening:, Ma. CROOKES gave
a lecture, in which he appears to have actually demonstrated the
possibility of weighing a ray of Light. Now if Light has weight,
the weight of Light in some quantity must be no light weight, and
in that case, therefore, it is manifestly not a paradox to say that
light is heavy.

Not satisfied with
Monday's discomfi-
ture, the conscien-
tious and energetic
W. E. G. has since
hung up his twenty-
seven headed syllabus
in the columns of the
Times. There is much
force, and we doubt
not solid foundation,
in his cross-question-
ing of the ministerial
bargain from _ the
pure Economist's
point of view., But
that is not the stand-
point from which JOHN BULL just now looks at it. He applauds a prompt act of " spirited policy,"—
annoying as such a strange piece of perversity may be to Ms. GLADSTONE—and persists in his "inflam-
matory approval" of MR. DISRAELI s unprecedented coup de bourse. Nothing can show this so clearly
as the hornet's nest MR. GLADSTONE and MR. LOWE have brought about their ears, even from the
friendly columns of their own Press, by their objections to the purchase. The course and conclusion
of Monday night's debate gave Parliamentary proof of the same incontestable, however inexplicable,
fact. MR. GLADSTONE must appeal from JOHN BULL "inflammatory " to JOHN BULL " condemnatory."
That appeal cannot be yet set down for hearing; but it may come on.
Tuesday (Lords).—Patents Bill: same as last year's, but with only one class of Patents (for fourteen
years) instead of two (one meant for "one-horse Patents, to last half as long), and without the power
to appoint professional referees, besides the Commissioners and Examiners of Patents, to sitt the
grounds of Patent claims—both changes for the worse, but said to be pressed on the Government ah
extra. No sufficient reason, we are glad to learn on satisfactory authority, for the complaints of
the Martini-Henry rifle as the soldier's shooting-iron.
(Commons.) First night with the Fugitive Slave Circulars.
MB. WHITBHEAD—as by right hereditary—moved Resolutions involving immediate withdrawal of
Number Two, without reference to the Commission's report.
MR. HANBURY moved a Resolution contra, to wait for the oracle from under the extinguisher.
Hence two nights of very long speeches; the lawvers having a good deal of the field to themselves,
and expatiating freely, but as unable as their lay-fellows to reconcile the irreconcilable.
There is no denying the fact that LORD CLARENDON in 1870 wrote a letter that goes the whole length
of Circular Number Two. Policy and public feeling, conscience and comity, the hearts of the British
Public and British Officers, and the heads of departments, are all alike at odds in this unlucky matter.

"Que diable allaient-ils fairs
dans cette galere f" Why didn't
Government leave the difficulty
as it has been left tiH now—in the
discretion of the British Captain'(
There seem to have been only six
hitches concerning fugitive slaves
in some thirty-six years; and
better any number of such hitches
than an official act of the Govern-
ment tying the hands of British
Naval Captains — discreet and
indiscreet alike — from helping
the slave out of his shackles.
Several speakers in the course
of the two nights' talk recalled,
with a sigh of regret, LORD MEL-
BOURNE'S famous query — in a
similar perplexity between con-
flicting courses with much to be
said for each—"Why not let it
alone?" It was a British
Admiral (SiR J. HAT), who sug-
gested the course Punch would
nave recommended, to await the
Commission's Report, and mean-
while withdraw the Circular.
Even staunch Conservatives
prayed" MB. DISRAELI to follow
SIR JOHN HAY'S sensible advice.
Of course, it isn't a party ques-
tion; of course, Her Majesty's
Government hates Slavery as
much as Her Majesty's Opposition.
But, unluckily, if a Member ef
H. M. 0. moves Resolutions, and
a Member of H. M. G. moves
counter - Resolutions, the fight
will become a party one in spite
of everybody's teeth, and so it
was here. Two nights' talk
(Tuesday's and Thursday's) ended
in a party division. Circular
Number Two stands, and MB..
WHJTBREAD'S Resolutions are
defeated by 45 (293 to 248), a few
of the usual supporters of the
Government holding aloof. A
solitary "Act" of stout MAJOR
O'GoRMAN's enlivened the long
and wearisome two nights' dis-
cussion of humanity, internation-
ality, and exterritoriality. The
portly Major wound up with an
impassioned allusion to his portly
Dartmoor protege, ARTHTTB. OR-
ION. What that obese impostor
has to do with the Slave Circular
is not clear, though, taking cor-
pulence and captivity together,
one does see an association of
ideas between him and a circular
slave. One thing must be said
to the House's credit. There
was less "cant" and "rant"
than might have been expected
on such a subject. - .
But whatever Commission may
report, and Commons vote, Punch
agrees with SIR HENRY JAMES
that Circular Number Two is as
dead as Circular Number One.
The country, simply, will not

PHILOLOGS" "IN SPORT."
IT is agreeable to notice a praiseworthy effort to make the study
of abstruse languages no longer a task and a drudgery, but a pastime
and a pleasure. . A Sanskrit Handbook for the Fireside has our
cordial wishes for its success through many editions -to come; and
we hopefully look forward to a time when the language, dealt with
in this very alluring manner, will have become as familiar as Irish
or Scotch, Erse or Gaelic, to many a solitary student by his lonely
hearth, to many a fair philologist in her comfortable chimney-
corner.
We are betraying no secrets, abusing no confidence, in announcing
that this help to Sanskrit is only the first of a series of Handbooks
planned to while away odd moments and unconsidered minutes. The
following pleasant little manuals may be expected to appear in due
course :—
Garden Strolls among Greek Hoots.

SUN v. STEAM.
ACCORDING to the Mhenauim, a Frenchman "states that he has
proved his .position of being enabled to use sunshine as a motive
power." This piece of scientific intelligence suggests three obvious
corollaries:—•
1. The employment of sunshine as a means of locomotion is alto-
getter distinct from the extraction of that article from
cucumbers.
2. Should a patent be taken out for the practical application of
this discovery, it will be of but little value in the Metropolis,
Manchester, and other large cities and towns, owing to the
absence of the motive power for a considerable portion of the
year.
3. It may be fairly assumed that within twelve months from this
time some other sanguine projector will uphold the claims of
another motive power as equally efficacious—namely Moon-
shine.
The Pope and the Pretender.
THE Carlist forces having been signally defeated at Vera, Estella,
and Totosa, DON CARLOS is told from the Vatican that, in the opinion
ot the Holy Father, " he ought to cease carrying on war in Spain
now that there is no probability of his being successful." His
Holiness, claiming to be the Vicegerent of Heaven, recognises the
safety of siding with the big battalions.

able movement in the East

will not be forgotten by
City opulence, appealing as
it must do to testes and
pursuits which, for many
generations, have been
cultivated with untiring
energy and complete suc-
cess to the East of Temple

sary to name the School of
Cookery and its wants, to
prompt the most hospitable Corporation in .the world; the 'Fish-
mongers, the Fruiterers, the Vintners, the Poulterers, the Cooks,
and all the rest of the festive City Companies; and the genial
Common Counoilmen of Portsoken, Vintry, and every other ward in
London, to end9w, with loving care and affectionate liberality, an
establishment in which they must all feel the deepest personal
interest—thereby showing that while they are mindful of the wants
of the larynx and the voice, they do not overlook the claims of the
epigastrium and the appetite, and are as sensible of the pleasures of
good eating, as they are alive to the delights of drinking in sweet
sounds. Music has had a hearing at the Mansion House: we hope
that Cookery also will soon receive proper attention in that congenial
atmosphere.

snowballing), how many carts, and of what capacity, will be re-
quired to cart away all the snow lying in one mile of a London

found this, find 'how many carts, of the same capacity, will be

"TUftCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE HARD-UP HORTICULTURISTS.
ET us give a tear to the sor-
rows of the poor Royal
Horticultural Society!
They were pathetically re-
counted by LORD ALFRED
CHTBCHJLL, presiding at the
adjourned annual meeting of
the Fellows of that impecu-
nious Corporation in their
Council Room, South Ken-
sington; and signally illus-
trate the auspiciousness of
the yeniiix loci. His Lordship
stated that:—
"In the past year the income
of the Society had been diminixh-
ing;, and the rent of the Garden*
had not been paid. The Boyal
Commissioners, howerer, had
given the Society three yean in
order to enable them to raise
their income up to £10,000 a
year. Up to tne present time
they had only received £3,000,
but still the year was young. If,
however, the income was not
raised in three yean to £10,000,
the Society could not any longer
exist."
The report above aad
In-low quoted contains no
reference to any payment or delivery of prizes due to successful competitors at the Society's
shows. Those debts may possibly have been paid, though rent is owing. But never say die!
"1 in. ALFRED SMKE was of opinion that, no matter what they did, they could not damage the prestige'
of the Boyal Horticultural Society."
No, indeed. The prestige of a Horticultural Society in arrears of rent for its grounds, or
prizes for its premium-winners, must be pretty well past damaging.
"Although the Society might be short of funds, it would still rise again."
Yes; in the meanwhile its motto may well be Jteturgam—for how long? DR. SMKS
continued:—
"They might do many things to raise the fortunes of the Society. They might have Skating Rinks and
other attractions, but unless they kept to the cultivation of horticulture, they could never maintain the
Gardens in their proper position.
At South Kensington? Is that a proper position for the Horticultural Gardens? And
would not the position be more suitable for " Skating Rinks and other attractions" than for
the "cultivation of horticulture"? If the "other attractions" included Skittles, the sad
Horticulturists might, at least, have a chance of competing with the " Jolly Gardeners."
The Horticultural Society has had losses, personal as well as pecuniary. It has lost
Fellows. There are some Societies that no Fellow can possibly be expected to remain in
connection with, and whose accounts are of the things no Fellow can understand, not even
LordDnndreary. But, of course, it would be uncivil to say that the Royal Horticultural Society
is one of them. A bold Fellow suggested an attempt to reclaim the Fellows they had lost:—
"He (MR. BOWRINO) was exceedingly glad that the Council had come round to the views of the
Fellows, and he would urge that it was of the highest importance that the Fellows who had been lost
should be recovered to the Society. ('Hear, hear!') Let the Council make a special appeal to those
Fellows to come back to their Society, and let there be a systematic house-to-house canvass in the
neighbourhood.''
"De I' audacetde Faudace, ft toujours de Patulaee .'" appears to be the motto of bold
MR. BOWBUTO. What cheek a Fellow—-any Fellow—must have to propose sending round
the Hat on behalf of the Royal Horticultural Society! Systematically, too, from house to
house in the neighbourhood! Would not that expedient be a little less unlikely to answer
in a remoter district wherein the Concern on which residents are solicited to bestow their
charity is less known than the R. H. S. is at South Kensington?
THE TURNER'S "TIP" TO THE CITY COMPANIES.
"I desire that each of these local institutions may thrive and prosper on that only basis on which
anything can permanently thrive and prosper—namely, the steady and careful performance of its
duties. ... So far from desiring their abolition, what I cordially desire is their development and expansion
in an application to duties that are of the greatest importance to tho country. ... It is not for an
infant to advise adults. . . . The main difficulty, no doubt, is the change of circumstances; but if we
look to the original duties of these ancient Guilds, we shall find in most instances they have disappeared,
and you do not know where to find them. There is required for full conformity to tie purposes of these
Companies, a change in the form in which their energies and resources were to be applied. ... A great
man of new wants hare come into existence. . . . The necessity of falling back upon our ingenuity, uinl
developing onr resource*, has become greater and greater. . . . Professional and technical training is
wanted by most of the various classes of our artisans . . . and all these classes are, as it were, knocking
at your doors, and asking what help you can giro them."—MR. GLADSTONE to the Turners' Company.
GREAT City Guilds, what think vou, pray,
Of the new Tueaer's " basis " V
Affairs are entering, one would say,
Upon a novel phaeis.
"New wants," indeed! the " want to know"
"Which Brother GLADSTONE starts with—
Is this the sort of thing to go
And trouble Civic hearts with?
This Woodman deals a sturdy stroke
Stark strength with skill combining.*
Duty with him is not a joke,
Or synonym for dining.
A guest extremely kind and nice
To have within your border,
Who gives you neatly-veiled advice
To—set your house in order!
Not JONES'S gush" nor COTTON'S smeer
Will this stern Woodman soften.
For tunning .'—well, his foes, I fear,
Deem he "s done that too often.
But when he spots a Upas tree,
And thinks it ripe for acting,
To turn Ami were a task, partite!
Titanic muscles taxing.
And yet this " infant's" cool advice
Perhaps is worth revolving,
Ere the new Turner thinks his thrice
And reaches to resolving;
Or other chopper-wielders rise
To mark your trees with " blazes,"
And tell home-truths to Companies
In less mellifluous phrases.
For these are days when revenue
Entails responsibility;
Big trusts are left to very few
To toy with in tranquillity.
Commissions sometimes take by storm
Strongholds of Corporation;
And then the " rude liand of Reform"
Works wondrous tribulation.
Neglected duties, funds too fat,
And interests sly and sinister—
Which he so gently hinted at,
Our fluent ex-Prime Minister,—
Are not the things to buoy a barque
When storm to storm seems beskoning:
How would it be, to build an ark
Against a day of reckoning?
Those duties of each ancient Guild,
To which old Charters bind them,
Most surely ought to be fulfilled
Wherever search may find them.
And if Time's metamorphosis
Have blurred their very traces,
One thing is certain, and 'tis this—
New ones must take their places!
Trade interests alone may yield
Full scope for all your vigour.
To bring Art-work into the field,
And put down rogues with rigour.
Are tasks to tax your cash and skill;
Since some who look upon her
Fear Britain's course must be down-bill,
Till scamped work brings dishonour.
Shrink not from Satire's friendly whip,
Nor pose yourselves as martyrs:
But take, in time, the Turner's "Tip,"
And overhaul your Charters.
Pageants, brave halls, and sumptuous
feeds,
Mean vulgar ostentation;
Trade and the Time have larger needs
Which claim consideration!

The Costumier. "BRING DOWN THE 'AKQRY CAT!"
HENRY THE
(Voice in the distance. "YES, SIR !")
[He must have meant "HENRI QUATRS," but that was what he said.
CHAIRS BEHIND COUNTEBS.
As a rule, when a customer enters a Draper's shop, an Assistant
hands that customer a chair. That is, if you are a Lady, or a
being of the lower sex at ladies' heels. Not if only a Man, come
shopping simply on your own account. Male customers never
have chairs offered them. The Shopmen know that the man will
be suited immediately. He will choose what he wants out of any
assortment of articles at a glance. Man, in making purchases, of
draperies at least, does not compare, deliberate, and judge. It is
not nis nature to. He will buy and be off. He won't sit down for
an hour, or even a minute. He does not want a chair, not he.
However, chairs are at his elbow, plenty, before the counter. But
there are none behind it. There, those who serve stand. The
Female Assistants stand, as well as the Shopmen, and have to stand
all day. A Lady, who at farthest will probably not exceed three
hours in choosing a silk or a muslin, has a seat provided for her;
but the Female Assistant, to say nothing of the Shopman, who
serves her, must keep on her legs not only while attending on
customers, but even whilst unoccupied, from early morning till
late at night. There is no sitting at the receipt of custom for
her; no sitting for anybody but the Cashier. Why does this
particularly brutal and barbarous arrangement exist ?" It is said
that this custom has to a certain extent been adopted out of defer-
ence to the supposed wishes of customers." So we learn from a
Circular signed by a number of Ladies resident in Bristol. Clifton,
and the neighbourhood, deprecating the regulation by which Female
Assistants in shops are "obliged to stand so many hours continu-
ously," to the detriment of their comfort and health. These are
their words :—
"Without any desire to interfere unduly in business arrangements, but
solely out of Hynijwthy with those of our own sex, we beg to submit to the
Master? of all retail shops in which women are employed aa Assistants, that it
would very much add to our comfort when we are making our purchases, if we
saw these young women relieved from this unnecessary strain upon their con-
stitution, by seats being provided for them, and permission given to sit and
take a few minutes' rest at the various intervals, in which, as we believe, the^-
might, when not serving, do so without neglecting the interests of their
employers."
This appeal, though addressed to all Shopkeepers who employ
Female Assistants, chiefly concerns Drapers. The Philosopher,
detained in a Draper's shop, and looking around him, is generally
struck with the pallid, hectic, pasty, flabby, and otherwise unwhole-
some visages of the Assistants, male and female. Of the hitter even
he may often grieve to notice that not a few have partially lost their
hair, so that their heads present here and there appearances similar
to the half-worn mop, or long-abandoned crow s-nest. He feels
that all this is partly owing to the vitiated air of the shop, always
peculiarly stuffy, though made so by emanations from sources worse
than stuffs, and he sees that the injurious effect of a bad atmosphere
is greatly aggravated by having to stand in it all day long.
The considerate Ladies who beg that Shopwomen may be allowed
seats, add the suggestion that all shops might advantageously "be
closed at a much earlier hour than is now the case." They truly
observe that—"The chief thing wanted is unanimity among the
Masters." An initiative is needful to render people unanimous who
are not so yet. Might it not be judiciously taken by any enter-
prising man of business, master of Female Assistants? He would
surely find it at least a safe "spec" to combine enterprise with
humanity. Who will risk it? "Seats behind the Counter"—
would not this be a taking legend in a shop-window amongst the
scrolls that teach us to come and buy? Of all attractive labels
announcing the " novelties of the season," would not this be the
Ticket?

UNITED AT LAST ! *
A Novelette for the Drawing-Room and the Kitchen.
CHAPTER I.—AU Wrong!
"DOW'T speak to me," said FRANCES. "I cannot bear to think o:
it. Your Master did not come back to-day, and I do not expect to
see him to-morrow."
She was a pretty, pouting young wife. Her complexion wai
cream-coloured, and her eyes a glorious hazel. When she smilec
her face became as bright as a sunbeam: but now, as she recline*
on her easy-chair, there was a curl about the ends of her rosy mouth
telling of great distress of mind. The expression of anxiety was
out o? place on that sweet, trusting countenance. So thought thr
faithful ATALANTA .
"You will find it will come all right, Mum, in the end" observe*
the faithful creature. "Take my word for it—it will all come
right."
* So many stories are published now-a-days without a purpose, that Mr
Ptmth has no hesitation in presenting hU readers with a tale having a ven
high purpose indeed—the spread of the science of Cookery. The style of its
popular Author is so patent in every line that it is unnecessary to divulge his
"I have done my best to make my home comfortable for his
»ake," continued the Mistress of the house; and her lip trembled.
'I have clothed the walls in blue-green tints, and hung up any
amount of delft and Persian plates. All the furniture is artistically
ugly and sesthetically uncomfortable; and, to please him, I have
changed your name from BETSY to AIALANTA, because I thought it
sounded more refined."
"Indeed you have, Mum," replied tho faithful creature.
"And yet he does not come!''
The words were scarcely out of her mouth when a loud knock was
leard at the front door. The two women looked at one another as
women will when they feel their hearts in their mouths. Then
CHANCES clapped her hands with joy, and ATALANTA glided grace-
'ully out of the room to attend to the visitor. In a moment more a
lurried step was heard on the stairs, the curtain barring the entrance
a the bo-uauir was thrust aside, and husband and wife were locked
n one another's arms. And then they began to talk. He was full
of conversation. He gave her a. precis of all the leaders in the daily
japers, and read many articles from tho Law Times, the Engineer,
ind the Economist.
"I could listen to you for hours," at last she said; adding, with
a smile, "Indeed, I have done so. But I want so very much to ask
you a question, dear."
"Nay, nay, pretty trifler," he replied hurriedly, but affectionately,
'you really must hear this. Listen!'
And then he read, from beginning to end, the last number of the
Journal of Ptycholngical Medicine. She listened with a half-smile
ipon her lips, but there was a feeling of anxiety at her heart—at her
heart of hearts.
"You must tell me," she said gently, hut firmly, why you did
not return to dinner P"
"Did I not?" he murmured, absently.
"0 EDWIN, you know you did not."
He blushed up to the roots of his hair. He felt that his evasion
was regarded as a subterfuge.
"You are right," ,he said, at last—and there was a hard, cold
expression about his eyes as he spoke—" I did not return to dinner."
She was all of a nutter, and the tears gathered in her eyas. In a
moment she was clasped to her husband's heart.
"0 my darling!' he cried, ,"we have been married only six
weeks, and yet a shadow has arisen between my loved one and
myself: a shadow bringing with it agony and '{remorse—a shadow
horrible and palpable!"
She was cold and p_ale now, hut she replied, oalmly, You-mean
the shadow of dinner?"
He buried bis face in his hands, and was silent.
"EDWDf, my love, my angel," she said, softly, "before we part
for ever—for part we must if the Club claims you daily for its own—
Nay, do not interrupt me, darling. I repeat, before we part let me
ask you, is there no hope?"
He was silent for a moment. Then he wiped away a few tell-tale
drops of moisture from his eyes. Then he sighed heavily, and pro-
duced a newspaper.
"Only this," he said. "Take it!" He moved towards the door-
way. When he reached the curtains he turned round and cried,
with a voice trembling with emotion, "My darling, 0 my darling,
I leave my dinner in your hands. Let us forget the past in a glorious
future."
As he disappeared she began to read the 'paper he had left with
her. A passage, was marked. The marked passage contained a
report of a Lecture upon Cookery delivered by MB. BTTCKMASTEE at
High Wycombe.
Soon her eyes glistened and her cheeks became rosy. "At last I
know the way," she murmured—" at last I knowthe way. And now
for ATALANTA."
She rang the bell, and soon the faithful creature was closeted
with her Mistress. At the end of the conversation the Mistress
kissed the servant, as women will under the impulse of a joy too
great to bear single-handed.

REAL "FASTING GIRLS."
THE announcement of "Another Fasting Girl," which is going the round of the papers
does not interest Mr. Punch. He is far more concerned for the poor fasting girls whose
total earnings for a week's work of eight hours a day only amount to three or four shillings.
There is certainly something of "the miraculous" in the fact that these unfortunate
creatures manage to keep body and soul together; rather more wonderful, thinks Mr. Punch,
than that a girl should be able to lie in bed and sustain life by the "moistening of her lips
with wine, brandy, &c." "Moistening" is a convenient word, and " &c." is a wide term.
A little wine and brandy, and a few " etceteras " would often save the life of an over-worked
sempstress, whose " fasting " had become a matter of cruel necessity.
If our readers wish to have brought home to them a real and recent case of this sadder
order of "fasting girls," let them read, mark, and digest this brief record, from last
Thursday's morning papers:—
"Last evening, MB. BEDFORD held an inquest at St. Martin's Vestry-hall, Charing Crosa, respecting
the death of ADA FILE, an unmarried woman, aged twenty-two years. From the evidence it appeared that
deceased and an elder sister lived in one room in
Chandos Street. Since the death of their mother,
who died recently, they have gained a precarious
livelihood by needlework. The deceased was at
work all Saturday night anJ Sunday morning.
At about half-past five on Sunday morning, ahe
gave a sudden shriek, and fell back in her chair,
and died almost immediately. The medical evi-
dence showed that the body was extremely
emaciated, and the stomach was completely empty.
All the internal organs were healthy, with tho
exception of the right side of the heart, which
was dilated. Death arose from the failure of the
action of the heart, produced by over work and
long abstinence from solid food. The Coroner
said it was a sad case, and the jury returned a
verdict in accordance with the medical evidence."
"EMPEESS" V. "QUEEN."
WHEN CJESAB shirked the kingly name,
And reigned as " Imperator,"
The choice implied no higher aim—
None deemed that title greater.
With anxious care he shunned the style
That Roman pride offended—
Content the " cives " to beguile,
And rule through forms less splendid.
What though that daring Soldier's sway,
Through scores of rogues transmitted,
Enslaved Old Europe, from the day
When Roman freedom flitted;
And, age by age, that name accurst
Has still, from first to latest,
Implied of Monarchies the worst,
But ne'er with us the greatest;—
What though the phantom of a Past
With crime and folly teeming,
Was, for a wonder, doomed to last
In faint imperial seeming,
Until this shadow of a shade,
A tyrant's views offending.
Like some old ghost, at length was laid
By NAP'S resolve unbending*;—
What though this empty name, the scorn
Of honest right and freedom,
In apish mimicry is borne
By those who little heed 'em ;—
Let mushroom dynasties that spring
From spoil and usurpation.
To this, as to each emblem cling
Of lawless domination.
For us, though now we go to school
Where crazy Crotchet s mission
Seems to be to subvert old rule
Of History or Tradition—
Still " King" or "Queen" from earliest
days,
To British understanding,
A sense of rank supreme conveys,
That brooks no rash expanding.
Symbol august of regal state,
With Freedom's spirit blended;
Can title so securely great
Be altered or amended?

THE SECOND, the last of the Emperors of the old
Holy Koman Empire, which was broken up by

GREAT SULTAN, stubborn 'gainst attacks,
Diplomacy attention begs,
While you digestion over-tax,
By this excess in hard-boiled eggs.
Look, where your Rayahs evil-starred
Oppression s cup drain to the dregs,
And think your yoke on them lies hard,
As on you yolks of hard-boiled eggs.
From scorn, wrong, robbery, grant them rest,
And you may spare your powder-kegs—
And find it easier to digest
Hard-worded notes than hard-boiled eggs;
Or, when Al Sirat's narrow bridge
You cross with rather shaky legs,
Rayahs will speed you o'er the ridge
With blessings on those hard-boiled eggs!

this act of apparent cordiality the condemned man con-
trived to twist out of joint the pen-lingers of the Critics'

but yon are very young, and as I do not suffer from either the one
or the other misfortune, I shall be able to educate you, so far as a
mere masculine intellect is capable of development.
To devote yoxir wealth to the noble pursuits of Science will be a
grand enterprise. Money is very needful for great experiments.

following ?-

W value a kind home more than high wages, as NURSE in a private

I don't at all mind owning that I've seen many better. People who
have seen me steal a baby, and then thump it on the floor, or treat
it like a football, may entertain a doubt if I can be “a Christian

will work for them for kindness' sake, and next to nothing wages,
may expect their advertisement to be treated as a joke, and

THE DUKE OF EDINBURGH is going to give something more than

on the National Wind Instrument of Scotland, with personal illus-
trations on the Bagpipes. Of course there will be a Bagpipe
Scholarship to add to the fleet of scholar-ships already announced.
The question as to “who will pay the piper” has not yet been
answered. Doubtless, H.R.H., as England's Sailor Prince, will also
throw in a Hornpipe Scholarship. The lucky winner of both
honours will be known as Kensington Bag-and-Hornpiper to H.R.H.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

* EBUKE. more pungent than Peers' pepper
usually ie (3fi>nda;/, Feb. 28), was adminis-
tered by LORD CARNARVON (Lords) to LORD
STANLEY OF ALDEBLEY, for his premature
condemnation of Authorities and Army in
our late Straits' shindy. LORD STANLKY
should have waited till the Papers were
before Parliament.
(Commons.)—ME. BIGGAR looked smaller
on the oollnpse of his raiip at the ROTHS-
CHILDS. The only one of that name now
in the House, SIR NATHANIEL, is not a
member of the Mighty Firm, and so has no
disqualifying interest in the Suez Canal
bargain. It is a pity that MR. BIGOAR did
not ask the one question before the other.
MB. GOSCHEN stirred the Vanguard mess,
with its accompanying messes, the Admi-
ralty Minute on the finding of the one Court-martial that was held, and the Admiralty
mistake in refusing the two Courts-martial that ought to have been held.
MR. WARD HUNT defended himself after his wont, blunderingly, but in perfect good faith.
He did not seem even to see the point of MR. GOSCHEN'S attack—that in over-riding the Court -
martial's censure of one of bis own colleagues by an Admiralty Minute, he was exposing a good
and gallant officer to the most unfavourable imputations. Also that a Court-martial on ADMIRAL
TARLETON and CAPTAIN HICKLKY, so far from a hardship, would have been the greatest boon
to both. The Service, differing on every other point in the case, agrees in dissatisfaction
at the withholding of full public inquirv into the conduct of the two officers exonerated by
the Admiralty Minute, and this without reference to their deserts in the case.
That is about the upshot of the long night's talk. Even MR, WABD HUNT must, one would
think, have got the true grnramen of his own blunder beaten into him by this time. It is
true, his power of resisting the ram of reason is amazing. Talk of iron-clads!
A snug job (creation of a Chief Civil Service Commissionership at £2000 a-year, for LORD
HAMPTON, at. seventy) rudely questioned, and all but upset. Too bad. Aren't there two
Commissioners to do the work, and hasn't LORD H. earned a retreat for his old age P
Tuesday (Lords). — Second Heading of LORD CAIRNS' BLLL, bringing the law as to
Crossed Cheques into accordance with mercantile practice, out of which a recent judgment
has rudely shaken it. A cheque crossed "& Co., may be paid through any banker. But
any one who takes a cheque specially crossed with a banker's name—except that banker—
does it at his peril.
LORD SANDHURST led an attack on Knightsbridge Barracks. But they have got to he re-
erected. The site is pronounced, on high authority, the best for strategic purposes—if the
Guards should ever have to do bloodier duty than guard the line of route for a procession—quod
Di arertant. Besides, the Duke assures us that the healthiest cavalry barracks are those
where men's rooms are over horses' stables. Troopers so lodged are not so liable to chills as when
they pass,.heated, from detached stables to gusty barrack-rooms. The ammoniacal odours, we
presume, they get used to. Nay, perhaps we shall be told these are medicinal. Did not an
elderly carcase-butcher tell the Smithfield Committee that if ever he felt a little " queer in his
inside" he used to go and inhale Ithc odours from the grating of one of the Smithtield sewers,
and it always brought him round better than any physic? Odor eqtii—like odor lucri—bonus est.
(Commons.)—The brisk Baronet of Chelsea gave the House a delightful night's ratting sport
over the " unref'ormed Corporations." There were some hundred little burrows left untouched
when the immirip:il rats were smoked out of the bigger boroughs. It was intended, no doubt,
to bring the sulphur and the ferrets to these lesser holes, after the big ones were cleansed and
set in order; but this latter work took more time and energy than was calculated,.and so the
venerable "rottenness of these cosy re-
treats of antiquated corruption was
spared to exercise the Chelsea Baronet's
keen taste for ferreting. Last year he
turned his ferret into the burrows of
New Romney, Uueensborough, and
Woodstock. This year the sport is
spread through Sussex, the Isle of
Wight, Dorsetshire, Devonshire, and
Cornwall. Shall Punch wrong DILKE
by picking the plums out of his pud-
ding? No. Let otir readers go to his
speech if they would enjoy the amazing
bag" of musty abuses and venerable
villanies his sharp eye and keen scent
have brought to light. Never was there
siich an unearthing of vermin since the
Pied Piper of Hamelin charmed the rats
into the Weser, and did not earn the
blessing of the Corporation.
MB. CROSS undertakes the future
ferreting in these well-stocked pre-
serves; and SIR CHARLES leaves the
sport in his hands. The vermin should
have been unearthed, and their rotten
old burrows cleared out, forty years ago
—but better late than never.
Wednesday.—Another Irish after-
noon. By doubling the usual number
of Parliamentary sponsors to a Bill, the
Irish Managers have doubled their
chances on the ballot for days. So we
are in for a good allowance of Irish Bills.
En rerrmrhe the English Members seem
disposed to leave Irishmen all the talk
on Irish business.
The Great O'GoRMAN moved to as-
similate Irish to English municipal
franchise. It would be more to the
purpose, if we could, to assimilate the
English municipal franchise to the Irish
—of {10 rating. As it is, haying made
the mistake of severing municipal taxa-
tion from representation, in our own
Corporations Reform Bill, we should be
cruel to do Ireland the same bad turn.
The Bill was thrown out by 176 to
148, a narrow majority under the cir-
cumstances.
Thursday (Lords).—Second Reading
of the Ecclesiastical Offices and Fees
Bill. Offices are to be amalgamated,
staffs reduced, fees diminished, vested
interests preserved or compensated,
£10,000 a year saved out of more than
four times that amount, and, with all
this, a salary to be screwed out of the
surplus for the new Judge under the
Public Worship Regulation Act. All
facts about fees are the better-for sharp
sifting—and those about Ecclesiastical
Fees are particularly likely to repay
investigation. So Pittirh can't pretend
to be sorry that the Bill was referred to
a Select Committee.
(Commons.)—Army Conversation and
Army Estimates.
HARDY—toiijoiirs hurdi—tackles his
hard task like a man. He gallantly
speaks up for the Knightsbridge Bar-
racks site—echoing the DUKE. The
road is to be widened when the barracks
are rebuilt. He increases the pay of
noncommissioned officers and rank and
file. He has settled a scheme of deferred
pay, both for the line and the reserve,
'atculnted to check desertion, and to
bring the reserve-men up to the colours.
He speaks, and thinks, hopefully of onr
recruits, and gives very good reasons
for so speaking and thinking; and he
has done his best to content the Medical
Service and attract to its ranks the
strength, now wanting. Altogether
HARDY shows cause for the extra half-

COLLISION EXTRAORDINARY.
COLLISIONS at sea are, as every one knows, but too common, though they usually occur when
one or the other of the vessels is urging on a wild career with supreme indifference to the
fate of any unlucky craft that may happen to be in the way. The disaster of the Sirathctyde
has tauglit us that broad daylight, smooth sea, and unimpeded sight of the vessel into
which you are driving, are no securities against running down. But we had yet to learn
that not even the fact of both ships being at anchor will prevent vessels from indulgence in
their favourite pastime. In the Wrecks and Casualties report of last week we read :—
"GRAVESEND, Feb. 27.—The Dorothy, of Sunderland, from Newcastle for Marseilles, has returned
from the Downs with damage, having been in collision with the Toivoiaar (barque), CAPTAIN LINDELI,,
from Shields for Genoa. Both vessels were at anchor at the time (midnight) in the Downs. The T(,\-
votaar has received considerable damage to quarter, &c."
_ If we feel profoundly puzzled how the Franconia came to run into the Strathclyde, we are
still more cunous to learn by what perverse capacity for mischief the Dorothy, at anchor,
managed to run into the luckless Toivotaar, at anchor too. At all events, the occurrence
goes far to justify ME. HUNT'S assertion that collisions "will" occur.

And I who have done so much for my country! Alas! how does
History repeat itself! Did not an ungrateful people make C.ESAR
himself sit in a swamp all night until he caught tho cramp, from
which he never fully recovered? "Was not HANNIBAL, the liberator

What of HELIOGABALUS? . What of IVANITCH THE FIKST of Russia,
whose near relation, the chief of the M'ScATCHiTT clan of Scotland,
was also cruelly rewarded hy his own ingrate countrymen? Not to
multiply examples, how about MAC ASSAR THE THTBD and ROWLAND

However, so be it! Farewell the tented field! Farewell the
elephant-hunt, and the death-struggle with the tiger! Farewell
the private scandal and the secret history of our life in India 1 Ha.!
Sir, do you not now regret not having forwarded me the paltry dross Y
Why, if you liked to come to terms now, aye, at the last moment, I
could a tale unfold of Indian life behind the scenes which would
make each particular porcupine stand on end, and send up your cir-

thousand a second would be your sale. Hut there are two sides to

of loyalty, I would not (except on the conditions just mentioned)
allow a single word of all this to pass my lips. But let me remind
you there are other firms, besides your publisher's, who know the
value of this offer. But I would rather, for old friettdship's sake,
that you were hrst in the field; so if you want to realise thousands,
send a buy on receipt of this with twenty-five pounds on account. §
• The cheque was sent, was received, and woe cashed. We know all about
it now, arid so shall the patient public.—ED.
t The evident reply to Our Correspondent's question, "Why cannot I
borrow?" is, of course, " Because no one would be such a donkey as to lend
you anything." We know Our Man by this time.—En.
J In spite of all that fias happened, and of all that may happen, we shall
always regret that a gentleman of such historical learning and research should
have so utterly thrown himself away as the public will subsequently learn he
has done. We willingly admit that eo accomplished and erudite a scholar
would be an ornament to any society. Alas! poor Yorick !—ED.
$ Here Our Correspondent at last let the cat out of the bag. In his eager-
ness to secure the moneVj he wrote, as may be seen, "send a boy on receipt of
Mi*"—forgetting that his letter was supposed to be written in India. We
secured the envelope. It was stamped Gravesmd! We took steps accord-
ingly. Gravcsend is associated with the place wherein to "spend a happy

I am bidding farewell to my old and faithful Sunderbund (a kind
of Indian valet), who has served me most faithfully ever since my
arrival. The poor fellow is weeping bitterly. *
It is a heartbreaking scene. Our Tattee is packed. I have given
away my last new pair of palankeens, with India-rubber straps,
made by the.best Indian tailor, to my old Suwarree (Indian cook),
while my pistols, I am presenting, as a souvenir instead of wages (for
as to wages, like "two into one, I can't), to my trusty Patarras (a
kind of gamekeeper), the truest shot in India.t
I suppose I must bid farewell to my Illustrious Friend, even if I
run the risk of having the bootjack thrown at me ; for this he will do
when suddenly roused from sleep.
My elephant, and camels, and Arab steed await me. I must depart
without noise, and get down to the coast. Away! Ah, the weeping

morning in India . . . unless before I embark;! receive a telegram
from Gravesend to say, "All right—cash paid—stay on the tout—

write you all particulars.

Oh, Sir, as you are great, be merciful! For the sake of my poor
•widowed mother! for the sake of my bedridden children and my
disconsolate wife, to whom your harsh conduct would be a death-
blow! for the sake of my family name! do not, do not ^proceed to
extremities ! J I admit it all. Let me tell my story, "iou wanted
» rir<4-rste Correspondent. I am that. You will own so much, I
know. Sir, I was on my way out—I mean I had packed up, and
was (for economy's sake) carrying my valise myself, down Regent
Street, in order to reach Charing Cross Station, when an intelligent
Hindoo, to whom I have often given a penny, thereby saving a dirty
boot, touched his turban, said "Salaam, Sahib!" and offered to
carry my small portmanteau for a trifle. While arguing with him
the simple point of remuneration for his services, I told him the
RTUOTITM PAL BOSHJABBA" (himself he meant) "can tell the Sahib
all he wants to know. RUMMITM tell him all Indian words—every-
thing that go on in his own country, all true, on RTJUMUM PAX'S

fader and moder, and his whitey wifey, and live happy ever after!
Who will know? RrJXJttnt PAL not tell! Sweareef Takum Aff a
Dava, RUMMUM no split on Sahib!"
Was not this a tempting offer? It was.
It was too much for me. Home ties held me. I went to Graves-
end. RUMMTTM PAL came down every evening after his dirty work
was done to do dirtier.
Sir, I have been betrayed. You have also suffered. Rmofuii's
Indian words were all humbug. So was he.
One evening, when, in consequence of some inexplicable delay on
your part, the-usual supply did not arrive, the RumtTTK became
very angry. Helcame the worse for liquor!; he got worse and worse
for liquor as the night wore on. He would not give me any Indian
words. He insisted upon receiving all the money himself—may I
never again have to do with such an unprincipled vagabond—and
because I would not yield a point (for with me, on honour, a bargain
is a bargain), he became violent, dashed his turban on the ground,
whirled his broomstick round his head, and exclaiming, "Hurroo
for owld Oireland!" upset the whiskey and rushed at me.
I was one too many tor him, and encountered him with the poker.
We parted, and I have not seen him since. When we next meet, I
shall have great pleasure in handing hi™ over to the police, as I
consider that you, Sir, have serious cause,of complaint against him,
and so have I.

now. I surrender him. He is not a bad boy. though, were I yon, I
would not implicitly trust all he says, especially when he is speaking
about me. The Indian Dictionary is, I regret to say, lost. I took
it to church by mistake for my prayer-book, and left it in the pew.
When I went to afternoon service it had disappeared. So much for
piety! I am now ready to go out to India, or wherever you like to

• The Clerk and the Policeman returned with the Boy. The B«y owned to
having spent the ten shillings. He never bought any Dictionary. He now
says that he went down with the money to Rosherville "to spend a happy
day." There, he says, he met Our Representative. The Boy (who is a brave
little follow) attacked him, and charged him with ingratitude to his em-
ployer. Our Representative retaliated, and threatened to take the Boy to the
nearest police-court. The case was serious, and the Boy'i mother interfered.
The Boy was induced to remain with eight-and-siipence at Gravetend. His
mother received eighteenpence, and left. Our Correspondent took the money,
saying he would giv» the Boy a weekly allowance of twopence. He kept his
word so far a» to giv» the Boy an I 0 U for that amount every Saturday. We
believe the Boy, and have blamed the Policeman for not havine brought up
the principal offender, who has now absconded. However, on behalf of liii
afflicted family mentioned in his appeal, we have written a full and free
pardon.

CHAPTER II.—All Right!
IT Was a'rery happy party. EDWIW and FRANCES, were seated at
a table upon which was
spread a snowy white
cloth, upon which were
placed some hot-house
flowers. He was eating

aglow with excitement.
In the background
ATALANTA stood like a
presiding genius, the
very impersonification
of contentment. The
faithful creature was
employed in removing
the dishes. The soup
had been praised; the
tish had been excel-
lent; the joint was on
the table.
"Come." said ED-
WIN, "this is some-
thing like a dinner. I

pouting. "1 followed
the direction* of the
grvat master."
"You mean BUCK-
MASTER?" put in
EDWIN.
"I do mean MR.
BUCKMASTER," replied
FRANCES, smiling. "A
piece of tape was tied
round the joint. The
dirty fork lets out the
gravy."
"It is beautifully
eookod!" murmured
KDWDT.
"It is," returned his
wife, with conscious
pride. "Thoroughly
agreeing with MB.
Hi CiMASTKK that it is
a f<r.'at mistake to keep
the pot bubbling away,
I got a receptacle large
enough to receive the
meat in, the clean soft
water I had heated to
about 190 degrees to
receive it. The meat
was boiled a quarter
of an hour to every
pound. 1 carefully
(with the assistance of
my faithful ATALANTA)
removed the scum every
now and then, and you
nee the result."
'' I do indeed 1' cried
EDWIN, laughing; mer-
rily, and holding out
his plate for a second
helping. •• How good

the soup was;!"
"Yes," murmured FRANCES, dreamily, "I followed the direc-
tions of Mii. BUCKSIASTEB. I put the meat in cold water, and set
it on the hob to simmer for three or four hours."
"Did you say culd water, my angel? Another potato, please!"
It was EDWIN who was speaking.
"Y'es. The joint was plunged into hot water, the meat forming
(with oatmeal) the nourishment of the soup, was thrown into cold.
In one case I wanted to keep the juices inside the joint, in the
other to get thejuices out into the soup. In future (following the
advice of MR. BUCKMASTER) I shall turn the liquid in which the
meat, is boiled into soup." This was said with a pretty little air of
determination.
"How good these potatoes are!" cried EDWIN, enthusiasti-
cally. "I am sure you
took the advice of MB.
BCCKMASTER on this
subject, too f"
I am not ashamed
to say I did," was the
reply of the sweet young
wife. "I selected no-
tatoes of the same size
and same variety, I
washed and scrubbed
them with a hard
brush."
"Did you remove the
skin before cooking?"
"Certainly not," she
cried. "If I had, all
the delicate flavour of
the potatoes would have
been lost. If a raw
potato is peeled, the
part giving the dis-
tinctive taste of the
different varieties —
which lies just under
the skin — is wasted.
No, Sir, I packed them
as tightly as possible in
a saucepan, and covered
them with the smallest
quantity of rain-water.
I brought them quickly
to the boil, and when
they did boil I set them
aside till they were
tender. I soon ascer-
tained that they were
tender by using a knit-
ting-needle—not, mark
me, a dirty fork. When
I knew that the pota-
toes were indeed tender,
I put them on the fire
to boil for two or three
minutes quickly. Then
I pourod all the water
I could away, gave the
potatoes a shake, and
took off the lid to allow
the remainder of the
water to evaporate.
Then, and not until
then, the potatoes were
peeled, and sent up to
table.'1
EDWIN was silent for
a long time, thinking
deeply and gravely;
then he rose from the
table, went to his
desk and wrote a short
note. All this while
FRANCES was watching
him anxiously and ea-
gerly. Then he came
to her, and smilingly
placed the letter in her
lair hands.
"My soul! " he mur-
mured, as he embraced
her, "it is my resigna-
tion of the Club. In
future I dine at home
with a darling little angel who knows how to cook. Thanks to
MB. BUCKMASTEB'S teaching, this is now a happy house — and,
darling, we are united at last!"
Our story is over. EDWIN and FBANCES (now MABQUIS and MAB-

couple to be found in the pages of liurke—their dinners are the

gladly give publicity:—
REASONS AGAINST the SCIENTIFIC TORTURE of ANIMALS,
most respectfully addressed to the Members of the House of Commws,
shortly to be engaged in the consideration of the question of Vivisection:—
Because it cannot b» justified without justifying the scientific torture of
an. To torture a man is not wrong on the ground that he is intelligent or
immortal, but only because he has a sensitive body; and the same is true of
all vertebrated animals.
Because it cannot be practised without an immediate hardening of heart to
students who grow up under it, and a spreading demoralisation in the com-
munity.
Because in particular it becomes impossible to punish boys for indulging
their boyish curiosity by cruel experiments, when philosophers indulge their
philosophic curiosity by experiments prodigiously more cruel. So too if a
philosopher may try how many minutes it takes to bake a dog to death, or
what amount of torture suffices to alienate his affection, rude man cannot be
punished for trying which of two animals has greater endurance of wounds.
Because a medical degree is at best a test of intellectual attainment, not of
gentleness, patience, and wisdom; and since one heartless man who has taken
a medical degree can torture in living death tens of thousands of dogs, cats,
and rabbits, no licence of torture can safely, wisely, or justly be granted to
any one by virtue of his degree or station.
Because the increasing use of more and more artificial apparatus for inge-
niously torturing our helpless, harmless, and innocent creatures, has been
accompanied with an increasing tendency in the medical profession to approve
of and promote artificial impurity in the blood and in morals; cruelty, reck-
lessness, and impurity going hand in hand; so that we are threatened with
demoralisation of a complicated order from the profession which ought simply
to minister to health,
Because it cannot be proved that any truth of science worth knowing is not
attainable by legitimate observations and experiments which involve no
cruelty, and especially by observations upon human beings.
„ Because in particular it is denied by competent medical authorities that the
circulation of the blood and the function of the nerves were discovered by
vivisection ; while other eminent persons have avowed that this cruel practice
has perpetuated error and distracted students from truer modes of discovery.
Because it is not even pretended that the cruelties aim directly at the
relief of human suffering. Avowedly they aim at science, that is, at the
gratification of curiosity; any relief to man from it is only contingent and
barely possible, and to judge by results may rather be called a fiction and a
fraud.
Because Christendom has long since been taunted by the nations beyond as
the hell of dumb animals, and Christianity must be eternally and fatally
disgraced if nations called Christian allow the perpetration of these heart-
rending enormities under any pretext whatever.

It would be difficult to find a better illustration of the softness of
heart—and head—at the bottom of the present vehement horror of
Vivisection. The Commission's Report recommends the'wise course,
regulate, but do not prohibit. Prevent the abuse of Vivisection,
but in the name of Science and Humanity do not deprive the world
of the use ol it.

make an example of you, as ADMIRAL T******* did of WILMOT,
when he ran his ship ashore.
SIR,
(Private.)
WHAT, in Heaven's name, do you mean by thinking, when
you ought to have been below instead of on deck—no, I mean ought
to have been on deck instead of in the tops? You did it for the
best, indeed! Why did you not follow the example of your Captain,
and do as he did? Had you drowned yourself, it would have been
better for us all.
(Private.)
DEAR CAPTAIN,
OF course you know best. There is no doubt that, if the
Captain's place on board the Iron Dtike was on deck, your place on
the Vanguard was below. If the Admiral was right in not being on
deck, which cannot be contradicted, then LIEUTENANT E • ought
to have known better than to remain out of his cabin. You are not
to blame any more than the fog.
(Private.)
Mr DEAR G«»»",
I AM in a fog. That is, they were in a fog. Do tell me
who ought to have been on deck and who below? When an Admiral
is below, ought the Captain to be in his berth? Has a Lieutenant
in charge any right to leave the wheel, or may he remain in the
galley r Answer me these questions at once, or I shall be in
a fix.
LOVELINESS BY LIMELIGHT.
"During the PRINCE OF WALES's visit to Agra, the Taj Mahal was illumi-
nated by coloured lamps and limelight, with results as little pleasing to the
senses as to esthetic sentiment. Malodorous fumes from myriads of oil lamps

'set-piece' on a windy night, could hardly have enhanced the native beauty
of the place, or—one would think—the pleasure of the Prince."—Our Own

UXORIOUS SHAH JEHAN, could you return
To view the peerless tomb your love created,
How would your Eastern blood within yon burn,
To see that sacred shrine so desecrated!
The snowy marble must have blushed for shame.
Better decay like Tadmor's should, with time, light
Upon that fairy dome, than it should flame
A la Cremorne, with coloured lamps and limelight!
Were Sahibs snobs that they should do this thing,
Where the East's Marble Miracle reposes,—
A dream of "mist and moonbeams" glistening
Amidst its clustering cypresses and roses?
A Prince's Progress has its needs, no doubt;
Yet is there not a dash of something sad in
Thought of the lovely Taj tricked, tawdry, out.

AURINKULAR CONFESSIONS.
(By Witncatet examined before Mr. Punch's own Royal Com-
mission.)
THE HONOUBABLE MR.
DAWDLE confesses
he thinks Rinking
rather fun than other-
Does not skate
himself. Likes to
drop in, don't
you know, and
look at other fol-
lows.
Mis« AURORA
GtisHTN GTON does
not mind confess-
ing that she dotes
upon the Rink.
Thinks it quite
too awfully jolly.
Is not very
strong, and gets
knocked up by
dancing. Can
skate for hours
and hours — at
least, when
CHAHLES is with
her.

DUPPE (unattached) skates because it 's cheap. Can't afford to hunt,
or to play rackets, or tennis. Rinking only costs you eighteenpence
a day. Cheapest exercise there is, and never wears one's boots out
as one does by walking.
LADY SHORTCOMMONS confesses, with a blush, that, as the mother
of six daughters, she looks upon the Rink as quite a heavenly insti-
tution. Girls must have amusement, or they $et out of sorts, and
even out of temper. Now skating is so economical a way of taking
exercise, and quite as fashionable as riding, which is so expensive.
Besides, there are always some eligible young men now at the Rink,
and who knows but an attachment may spring up from a premedi-
tated tumble. Really, don't you know, a Kink is quite as suited for
flirtation as a ball-room; and there 's no expense incurred for bou-
quets or evening dresses.
MR. SLOWCOACH confesses he objects to this new-fangled amuse-
ment. Thinks it quite un-English to go skating in summer-time.
Seems to him like flying in the face of Nature.
MR. DASHERTON confesses he goes in for Rinking a good deal.
Has averaged five hours a day for the last six months. Doesn't care
much for the skating — in fact, considers it a bore. But likes
meeting girls one knows, you know, and having larks and chaffing
with llii'iii.
MR. BONESETTER confesses that, professionally speaking, he much
approves of this new fashion ot skating upon wheels, for it has
brought him several highly interesting cases. Asphalte is more
dangerous to tumble on than ice; accidents, though personally
pitiable, are professionally paying.
Miss OOLEWELL confesses she loves Rinking. Those little ducks
of hats are so delightfully becoming, and a short skirt looks so well
when one has pretty feet and ankles. It 's really, don't you know,
almost as awfully nice as valsing. Indeed, in one respect, it's
nicer, for if one feels timid one needn't be ashamed of leaning upon
somebody.
CAPTAIN RATTLECASH thinks Rinking a good spec. He has helped
to get up heaps of Rinks, and, as a promoter, of course has helped
himself to something handsoms.
MB. SPOONLEY confesses that he's awfully fond of Winking.
Yes, he means to say Winking. Can't pronounce his R's well.
Likes Winking better than waltzing. Comes a cwopper pwetty
often. Hasn 't fallen in love yet.
Miss DOLDRUMS confesses she thinks Rinking a sadly demoralis-
ing habit, and one likely to produce a most pernicious influence upon
the female character.
MB. ADONIS WOBBLEBY confesses, upon pressure, that although
he is most brilliant in a ball-room, he does not shine on wheels.
Has an uncommonly fine figure (for a fellow over forty), but rarely
shows it on the Rink for fear of looking awkward.
Miss PRETTIPET confesses, with some shyness, that she delights
in skating; that is to say, when she gets some one nice to teach
her. Really, is so nervous that she dares not try alone, but can
manage pretty well, if some one holds her by the hand. When
one makes a slip, you know, he cannot well help squeezing it. (The
last six words were spoken in so low a tone mat the Witness was
obliged, with great reluctance, to repeat them.)
SIR .CHARLES DILKE AND THE CORPORATIONS.
ALAS, ye unreformed Municipalities,
With small venalities,
Saltash, Lostwithiel, Pevensey, and.Wareham,
This harum-scarum
Young Baronet has tried you, taking notes
From the Land's End, it seems, to John o' Groat's,
And swears your members all are greedy sinners,
Who spend the public money upon dinners.
Certos, not quite un-English this proclivity
To free festivity:
GLADSTONE, in tones half menace and half pity,
Has told the City
That not for banquets did our fathers build
The deep foundations of the traders' Guild:
And who can doubt that all men will be learners
From WILLIAM'S wise sayings to the Turners 'i
So Romney, with your very grave election *
(Then gay refection),
And Brading, with your Hall for Aldermen,
Eight feet by ten.t
And Plympton Earle, that sold the portrait rare
Of great Sis JOSHUA, your most famous Mayor,J
Not very long the public shall you bilk:
Reform must follow on the words of DILKE.
• "The Corporators of New Romney sat round a tomb to elect their Mayor,
and, locking the gate of the Church to keep the people out, declared them-
selves a public meeting of the inhabitants."
t "At Brading the Town Ilall and the Stocks were the only outward and
visible signs of the exislenee of the Corporation. The Town Hall was the
smallest he ever saw, being only eight foot by ten."
t "SiE JOSHUA REYNOLDS was once flavor of Plvmpton Earle, and,
not being able on one occasion to attend the Corporation dinner, he sent down
his portrait, painted by himself, to be put in his vacant place. It was after-
wards hung in the Town Hall, but, after a long period had elapsed, the
representatives of the Aldermen claimed that the portrait had not been given
to the Corporation, but to the Aldermen as private individuals. They sold it,
•nd it was now in the possession of LORD EOREMONT, at Silverton Park."

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

LANK-CARTRIDGE fire—not
• -o'xvxx. s —^\\^~<^ L exactly a feu de joie—
^V^^^ in the Lords (Monday,
M&rch 6) from LORD
STRATHEDEN AND CAMP-
BELL over the Andrassy
Note. LORD DERBY said
what little there is to be
said, in a case where
there is nothing to be
done but to keep our eyes
open, mouths shut, and see what the SULTAN will send us. We couldn't keep our fingers out
of the Turkey Pie when all the Great Powers were dipping theirs in; but it is a comfort to
know we have not plunged them deeper than was inevitable, and than will allow us to take
them out without soiling—it is to be hoped—or burning.
(Cemmtatt).—A night on the Suez Canal. The Government declines a partnership in the
Egyptian National Bank. It has not declined to appoint, with France and Italy, one of
three receivers of Egyptian revenue, with power to appropriate the needful out of Egyptian i
income, for payment of Egyptian debt. Unfortunately any dealing with the KHEDIVE flings
our Government among the bulls and the bears. It is unlucky that our road to India should
lie, not only through the Suez Canal, but through the dirty alleys of the Stock Exchange.
MR. GLADSTONE twitted the Government on the dismissal of SLR D. LANGE from the
English agency of the Canal Company. M. DE LESSEPS wants to show he is still master of his
own house, if England flatters herself she has bought the latch-key. MB. GLADSTONE thinks,
as most people are likely to think, the publication of private and confidential despatches an
inadvertence and an error, and suggested that the Government ought to intervene on behalf of
an agent whose only fault was being too English.
MR. DISRAELI retorted with some irritation. SIR D. LANGE had not asked the interven-
tion of Government. When he did it would be time to consider of action on his behalf.
Two, and the most important, of his five Dispatches published, were not marked "private
and confidential." Besides, LORD GRANVILLE had seen the Blue Book, and had not objected
to their publication.
LORD HARTINGTON explained that the papers were sent to LORD GRANVILIE merely as an
act of courtesy, and that he had not been consulted as to the propriety of the publication of
SIR D. LANGE'S Dispatches.
Altogether, MR.T)ISRAELI did not come brilliantly out of the night's skirmish. The Bill
to raise the Four Millions was read a Third Time.
In Committee of Supply on Army Estimates. SIR. WILFRID poked fun at the increase of
MR. HARDY'S little Bill; and MK. PEASE, with better taste and more sense, withdrew his
Motion to knock off 10,000 men.
MR. HARDY defended his estimates gallantly. He hankers after MB. ANDERSON'S scheme
for marking recruits in vaccination. And why not? There seems more prejudice than
reason against such a plan of making a " marksman " of the British recruit. Of course, if
outsiders will call such a mark a " brand," it sounds ugly, and is likely to be pooh-poohed.
If it be adopted, officers should be marked as well as men.
An Irish row over the appointment of the Referee Committee. MR. SULLIVAN wanted
more Irish Members on the Committee. MR. BUTT was not there to keep the "boys" in
VOL. LSJ. j,
order; and so SULLIVAN and O'GORMAN
between them kept up the game, through
seventeen divisions, till after four in the
morning! Now "division," like love,
may be
"The sowl of a nate Irishman,"
but Englishmen get tired of the sport,
when begun unreasonably and kept up
hopelessly.
MR. SULLIVAN ought to know better
than discredit Quid Ireland by such
"devilry," especially when all decent folks
—even M.P.'s—want to be in bed. The
pleasantest Club in London will lose its
character if this sort of thing happens
often. To be sure, the Home-Rulers are
not particularly anxious to promote tie
harmony of its evenings.
Tuesday (Lords).—LORD GRANVILLE dis-
posed of MB. DISRAELI'S statement that he
had sanctioned the publication of the Lange
Despatches. LORD DERBY had to admit
that no such sanction had been given. He
added a lame defence of what remains,
after all said and done, an official blunder,
if no worse.
The best summary of the pro and con.
on the subject of the Slave Circular that
Parliament has yet obliged us with. LORD
CAIRNS for the Government, LORD SEL-
BORNE against. LORD SELBOHNE'S argument
clinches the case against Circular Number
Two. Why not have substituted for it a
declaration that we would not restore
Fugitive Slaves, and leave the aggrieved
Governments to look after their own
Niggers? That's what it must come to,
with more or less circumlocution.
(Common*).—Three talks on Wine Duties,
Tralee Savings Bank Losses, and Railway
Passengers Duty. Government won't give
Select Committees on the two first (won-
derful! Select Committees are not granted
as asked, then); but to make up for the
unexpected refusal, grants one on the
third.
Wednesday (Commons).—Great rejoic-
ings of Opposition. In the fight over MR.
M'LAGANS Scotch Game Laws Bill,
Government floored by 172 to 150. First
blood for the Opposition!
It is true it was a scramble. The
Government didn't seem quite to know
their own mind. The Bill was a decently
good Bill, on a subject fertile of bad
blood, and hard to handle reasonably.
Scotch Members are not so easily driven as
English, when the Government road is one
they don't want to go.
It wasn't much of a victory, but the
Opposition is thankful for small mercies in
that way, and yelled vociferously at the
announcement of the division.
Thursday (Lords).—An instructive talk
on LORD SALISBURY'S Oxford Reform Bill.
When their Lordships do talk to the point,
their wisdom is wonderful. W e seem in their
high House to breathe a serener atmosphere
than the hot, if breezy and healthy, breath
of the Commons. But who are the "Idle
Fellows" LORD SALISBURY is for waging
such tierce war on? Punch would have
said that Clerical fellows, as a rule, best
answered the description. The danger
seems to be that LORD SALISBURY'S Bill will
hand over the University to the tender
mercies of these very Clericals. If that is
what LORD SALISBURY meansby strengthen-
ing the University element, we would rather
he strengthened the Colleges, by getting rid
of the Clerical dry rot which now infests
them, and left the University to take care
of itself.
(Commons).—Queen or Empress? Which

is it to be ?" Empress," says Ms. DISRAELI, with much emphasis, ye
with little force of logic, or reason of history. "Queen." says MR
GLABSTONB, with emphasis all the more effective for the pulse of
patriotism and force of feeling that beat and glowed under his words
The House, like the Country, is most anxious to avoid anything
that shall have the appearance of interfering with HER MAJESTY'?
choice of a title, still more of disapproving any title she may choose
But HER MAJESTY always feels with the Country. For her best title,
if she still hesitates, we beg to refer her to our Cartoon, and to reminc
her of the additional reason she has given in favour of "Queen ol
the East," by her last week's visit to the London Hospital, and the
womanly and motherly feeling which guided her kind hand to poor
little KATIE AMBLEB'S pale cheek.
Friday (Lords).—A good word for a good thing—LORD SHAFTES-
BURYon Training-ships—themost useful of machines (witness the boy-
heroes of the Goliath] to work up the waste of our back slums into
stout "fearnought"—about the best stuff going for wear and tear.
Government admits the need of able Seamen and the feasibility of
converting our X. Y. Z.'s into A.-B.'s. The question is, who 's to
find the money? The Ship-owners, for whose use the article is
manufactured, are not at alt disposed to pay for it. JOHN BULL
doesn't like to be asked to dip his hands in his pocket, though it
would be cheaper, in the end, to turn street Arabs into sea-boys
than into gaol-birds.
(Commons.)—MB. BRASSEY on the same tack as LORD SHAFTKS-
TUTRY. Punch is glad to hear that the Admiralty is ready to pay
twenty-five pounds for every trained boy who joins the Navy, and
three pounds for every Naval Reserve boy, and to provide three
training-ships a year.
MB. BBASSEY, besides training-ships to look after the launching
of our Jack-tars, wants a Pension Fund to provide for them when
"laid up in ordinary "—their best berth, when disabled, now being
the Workhouse.
Here o^ain Government is welcome to do its utmost, but Ship-
owners will not hew of a compulsory contribution. The Sailors'
Friends must fall back on "Voluntary Contributions "—in other
words, the generous must pay for the selfish.
"So was it ere my life began,
tio is it, sitK'i- I'vr bean a man,
So will it be Than I am gone!
Let SH AFT ES WHYS, BKASSBYS, still work on 1"
Altogether, this has been one of MR. DISRAELI'S bad weeks. He
has treated the House, strange to say, to bad taste, bad temper, »»d
stranger still, bad talk. MR. GLADSTONE, on the other hand, ha*
been in rare force—quite a revival of the old man—

OUR NEW NOVEL.
CONFIDENTIAL ADDKESS.
Ons Readers will learn with pleasure that negotiations have been
entered into with an Authoress of great repute, as the representative
of a certain school of fiction, for the immediate production of a
Novel in this Journal. The Editor, in pursuance of his usual course
of plain-spoken and open dealing between himself and the Readers
of this paper, wishes to put them in possession, at once, of the cir-
cumstances attending this new arrangement. For reasons which
will be appreciated in the proper quarter, he gives to the Public the
correspondence that has passed between the gifted Authoress and
himself, in lieu of preface to the forthcoming work, which he
believes will prove itself to be the Authoress's chefd'ceuvre—unsur-
passed by any work of fiction within the present century.

I HAVE not had the great pleasure of reading any of your
charming Novels, but having heard from a great number of my
fairest and liveliest friends that your works are "awfully good," I
hare determined upon asking you to give us something in your very
best and most characteristic style. You understand, of course, the
high moral tone which is required from all Contributors to this
Journal, and I am certain that it will be your aim and object, as
well as your greatest pride and truest pleasure, not only to adorn
your talej but also to point clearly and emphatically a first-rate and

undoubted and acknowledged talents, jHE

Mr DEAU Yororo LADY,
I NEVER object to " tremendous interest," even up to fifty
per cent. Yet permit me to observe, as a matter of business, that,
en the interest is extraordinary, the risk is proportionately large.
You will take this remark as made from a humorous point of view,
and will have too much uncommon sense to be in the least offended.
In fact, I am sure that I may leave the question of "Love interest"
to vour own good taste, delicate feeling, and excellent judgment.
With most profound respect for your genius, and every confidence
in the result of our arrangement,
I beg to remain, &c., &c. (as before).
From Miss R. D. to the Editor.

interest with proportionate risk. Of course I do not write for milk-

divine ambrosial loveliness. Those who listen to the voice of this
Syren, must prepare their palates for goblets of the vein-tingling

demure Hebe serving out flabby toast and wishy-washy tea to sleek

my dear Sir, depend upon me for that. I am proud to say that there
is not one of my novels which has not been written with the highest

"milksops " among our readers. I should request them to take their

in your letter. I heartily agree with you, and, holding out the
right hand of fellowship, I wfll order the 'agreement to be drawn out
at once, and am yours strenuously and hardily, jjjg EDITOR.
P.S.— I couldn't get Red as a Nose at either MUDIB'S or SMITH'S.
I suppose the run on it was enormous. Should like to read it. You
might send me a presentation copy on toned paper.
DEAR SIB From Miss R. D. to the Editor.
YOUR letter is highly satisfactory. Now I understand you.
As you say, "Tapioca for the Timid," so I may be permitted to add
Rice for the Respectable! Venison for the Venturesome!! Beef for
the Bold!!! Why did you not tell me at first the sort of thing vou
expected? I detest beating about the bush. But now vou shall
have your Novel. You want a real good thing — the pith and marrow
of Red as a Arose is She., Good-bye, Sweet Tart, Not Slily, but don't
Tell, Cometh Dmcn Like a Shower, and the rest of my popular
works, all distilled into one strong, clear jelly— a very Lieoeg's
Essence of a Novel! Good, my dear Sir, you shall have it. "Man
wants but little here below, but wants that little strong."
Yours sincerely, R. D.
P.S.—" That Little— Strong!" wouldn't be a bad title. But I
prefer either titles of popular songs or a bit of a proverb. I have
had my eve on several song- titles, such as " Tommy, make room
for your Uncle," which might be cut into " For Your Uncle ;" also
"Don't be Sorrowful, Darling," which could come out well as
"Sorrowful Darling!" * * t Stay! I have just put my hand on
what I am told is quite a catch phrase about Town now, and that
will be half the battle of popularity. It is " There '» another ffood
Man gone Wrong." You can therefore announce my new Novel as
GONE WRONG!
And you can advertise the first Number foy your Next.
* On showing this loiter of the gifted Authoress to a confidential friend,
whose advice we have hitherto found invaluable, he remarked, "Ahem! —
'veins throbbing '— * pulse beating with ecstasy '— ah — um— if the Novel is to
have this effect on you, don't you think it would be as well to keep a first-rate
medical man on the premises?" We felt he was right, and acting on this
suggestion, we intend to edit the forthcoming work under medical advice.

has, with the advice of his Solicitor, inserted a clause in the agreement with
Miss It. I), (in whom he has, of course, all the confidence consistent with
ignorance of the gifted lady's previous writings), to the effect that, on occasion,
he m»y, in hia highly responsible capacity of Editor, insert a little explanatory
note, or remark, wherever the text may appear to require it. To this the
distinguished Authoress has, with a ladylike courtesy which does credit at
once to her head and heart, replied, that, aa her text will need no comment,
she has no objection to the insertion of the above-mentioned clause, which
stipulation the talented Lady goes on to observe, seems to please the Editor,
and can do no sort of harm fo the writer. On this amiuable understanding,
the Editor has the greatest possible pleasure in welcoming this rarely-qualified
'Writer a« a contributor, who will widely extend her already large circle of
ardent admirers.
A ZODIACAL CONGRESS.

Ai KKTINCJ of the Signs
of the Zodiac, in re-
ference to the state of
the weather, was re-
cently held at the Mermaid
TilVl'lTl.
As tie PISCES (though
"parents of sweetest
sounds ") are not
famous for ora-
tory, AQUARIUS
was unanimously
voted to tiie
Chair.
The venerable
but rather wash-
ed out Chairman
remarked that,
although his duty
had ended in
February, his
successors had
carried out his
aqueous policy
with real consis-
tency, for which
he heartily
thanked them. He was proud to be able to say, in the words of
'"Piicium et sumina genus htesit ulmo,
Note qu;r- sedrs fuerat Columbia."
PISCES wagged their tails in grateful response. There was no need
to provide for them a special aquarium, as the room was under water.
ARIES rose to dissent from the Chairman's watery discourse. His
favourite grass meadows were all overflowed. It was his chief
duty to provide good mutton for the Lords of Creation, and that
could not be done unless the sheep had wholesome grass to eat. Had
it not been for the fun he had lately had—on salt water—thanks to
the employment found him by the Iron Duke, he really hardly
knew how he could have stooa the late superfluity of fresh water
vouchsafed by JUPITER PLUVTUS.
TAUKUS followed on the same side. He had no personal disrespect
to the Chairman, but he should lie to see him cross his paddock
with water-buckets. He should have an aSrial voyage gratis, and
see how he relished another element. He had quite enough to do
on the Stock-Exchange, in keeping up his " Egyptians," without
having to waste his time on a set of " Putn,ps.'"
The GEMINI spoke together, and swore a little, but they were
suddenly interrupted by
LEO,,who, having kicked CANCER out of the way, roared his
approval of the remarks of ARIES and TAURUS. Both men and lions
wanted beef and mutton (sensation), and you couldn't grow either in
wet weather. For his part, he was thankful that the Ministers had
given him a permanent interest in the fine dry climate of Egypt,
and the Canal he was most concerned in was one not of drainage,
but—passage! (Sensation.)
LIBSA rose to deprecate political allusions. It was his object, and
should be that of his brother and sister Signs, to hold the balance
between Government and Opposition. Open to all parties,
influenced by none," should be the motto whether of houses, or
Planets, who hung out Signs to the public! He hoped his friend
AQUA&IUS would not misconstrue him.
Here LIBRA was out short by an unanimous call for
Viaeo, who remarked, in a musical voice, that, as she looked for
garden-parties and pleasant hours on the river in that part of the
year which was specially her own, she should take good care that
strawberries and flirtations should not be spoilt by the extravagant
folly of the Chairman and his clique. A great poet—Atf ACEEON—
"Nature to bulls gave horns,
To lions tierce-fang'd jaws "——
But to Woman (he sang)
"What's Nature's boon '—'tis beauty-
More than a match for shields,
More than a match for spears!"
With such authority on her side, she had courage to defy what she
must call the fishy conspiracy against the comfort of mankind.
Aquariums were all very well, particularly with " covered" rinks
attached to them; but to turn the world into an aquarium was a
thing unendurable. The race of mortals should have a summer this
year, if a lady hod anything like the influence due to her sex with
the Clerk of the Weather.
The speech was greeted by loud cheers, led by LEO and TABBUS,
and the meeting broke up without a vote of thanks to the Chairman.

"I see before me say two thousand honest, virtuous, industrious young
women, working hard and half starved; and I see before me at least twenty
thousand other women holding out plenty in both hands, and that plenty
rejected with scorn by young women of very little merit, or, if not rejected,
accepted only under vexatious and galling conditions imposed by the persons
to be benefited. . . The way the modest householder is ground down by these
young ladies is a grievance too large to be dealt with under this head, and will
probably lead to a Masters' and Mistresses' League. . . . Why do they (the
Sempstresses) sit hungjry to the dullest of all labour, and hold aloof from
domestic service, at a time when Ladies born are beginning to recognise how
much better off is the rich housemaid than the poor Lady i . . . They think
a female servant has no ' liberty,' and that her principal remuneration is her
'wages.' . . Her wages are as a drop in the ocean of her remuneration. . . In
the place where she pigged with her relations, she often had a bit of bacon for
dinner and a red herring for supper. In the palace of cleanliness and comfort
she is promoted to she gets at least four meals a day, and butcher's meat at
two of them. . . The wages of her class have been raised, when they ought to

DEAR SUSAX JANE,
I takes my rjen, I may say. con amory,
Just to relieve my mind a bit. much a more wicked story
Than that there MB. READE, as writes his nibbidge to the Telly,
/never see. And that, as JOHN would say, 's the casein belly!
Of course you 've read his letter, ST/E. A nasty, spiteful—there, I
Should like to comb his wool a bit, and so says JOHN and SAIKT.
Which what domestic Ladies, SUE, possessed of sense and sperrit.

A lot he knows about it. I dessay, as talks of Mississes
Being ground down by Servants. He should know what groans and

If the slandered twenty thousand in his presence might but muster;
I 'd like to tackle him alone, armed with my tongue—and duster!
He seems to think us Servants' lives is regular paradises— _
"Where ignerance and cetrer." But, oh lor! my dander rises
When he says our wages is too high, and reckons up our perkses.
A Screw, as ought to go and herd with Ottingtots or Turkses!
And then his nasty insults, SITE! Young Ladies in our stations
Don't feed on no red herrings when we pigs with our relations "—
0 drat his imperence!—which, Sun, it well to you beknown is,

"Trampling too hard on Mississes "? I wish he 'd got a sample
Of Stnckup Naggers at his heels. I guess he 'd want to trample!
Which if us Servants didn't show a sperrit, lawkamussy,
Tain't us would play that little game, but rather wisey wussy!
And as to talk of cutting down our liberty and wages—
Well, there—it ain't no use, I s'pose, to fly into seph rages!
1 've spilt the ink, and Missis is that horridly pertikler I
But let who will knock under, SUE, I keeps my perpendikler.

They 'd better try it on, they had! I 'd like to see 'em at it!
I proudly hopes there's none on us, from Brixton to Belgravy,
As wouldn't rally to the flag; no not the veriest slavey!
And as to them there Sempstresses he 'd shove into our eribses—
Walker! I says. The letter, SUE, 's all foolishness and fibses.
Just like that " Lady Helpses " dodge! Would READE, for all his
bawling,
Relish two thousand Hammy Toors pitchforked into his calling?
He says we holds our heads too high. I guess we'll hold 'em higher.
It's time we pulled together, SUE. But there! that's Miss MARIAK

And so no more at present from your much-riled

black pudding was a favourite dish at all state dinners. In default
of other sweets, they beat their wives into a jelly, or made mince-
meat of their enemies. As regards one dish of this appetising menu
ancient Ethiopia may boast a rival in our modern Black Country.

MERE METAPHOR.

OME writers say that
an English public
ahip, wherever she
goes, is part of the
English soil. ... I
must, beg leave to
ilotibt the accuracy
of that proposition.
I believe it to be
a metaphor, and a
metaphor eminently
calculated to mis-
lead." — Lo EI>
CAIRNS on the Slave
Circular.
"There is no
such thing M a
Slave by the law
of England." —
LORD HOLT, at
quoted by LORD
COLBKIDOB.
Jack (looking up from hie fffiomjaperj.
What's a fl metafore," Mate f
Bill (scratching his head}. Well, I can't rightly say;
But it's poetry-lingo for somethin' or other;
A sort of a figger o' speech, anyway,
As seems to say one thing and means quite another.
Jack. Hang sich figgers o' speech then! A false figger-head
To a sneaking; piratical craft isn't wuss!
Bill. Dont know as you 're werry far out when all's said;
But if land coves will use 'em, 'taint nothin" to us.
Jack. Ain't BO sure about that! Here's a Parlyment chap—
Their top-sawyer Lawyer, I take it—as says
That we Jacks has been sniffin' this " Metafore " trap,
And is like to be caught in it one o' these days.
Sill. How's that, JACK?
Jack. D'ye see, we have had an idee
As our deck is a bit lik« o' free British soiL
But this chap says, says he, that's pure fiddlededee—
Mere misleadin' "metafore "!
Pity to spoil
A Htraightforrard rule with such stuff, JACK, say ].

A "metafore," eh Bnx! That sticks in my gizzard
Which how many more such false signals is nying

All that 'bout BKIIAJ*YBR a rulin' the waves,

With the Union Jack as can't cover no slaves,

Avast jawing, JACK! Soft'.

The part o' Perlice to soaped Niggers and such,
Why, don't let us have no more metafores," pray,
'Cos they only means bounce when they 're put to

Jack (pointing to Paper). Here's lots o' palawr: I don't
rightly see
What the plague they are driving at. When they
have done,
I hope that plain fellows, like yon, Bin, and me,
May be able to spell out our duty. For one
I goes for the faith of the true-blue old school,
That a man-o'-war's deck's like a bit o' free land;
But if that's only Metafore—let's have the rule
Put in plain English speech as we '11 all understand.
THE ANGEL IN THE HOUSE.
(An Apostrophe to DB. JoaTfsoir.)
MARXEBD life is indeed a sad aflair when all the conversation
between the partners is "whether the mutton shall be boiled or
roast, and3>robably a dispute about that." But in so saying, DB.
JOHN sow, von did not mean to countenance a foolish disesteem of
eating, and to censure culinary discussion. No, Sir—not you. A
conference—no altercation—between husband and wife as to what
shall be done with the mutton or the beef—question not confined to
the alternative of boiling or roasting, but extending to the possi-
bility of frying, stewing, mincing, hashing, making a vol-au-vent
ot it, or a curry, or bubble-and-squeak—this, Sir, surely you would
consider anjntellectual talk on a practical branch of the most useful
knowledge. You were never the man to disparage gastronomy, or
gastrology either; yon. Sir, who declared that " the man who would
not take care of his belly would hardly take care of anything
else."
Sir, an interesting letter in the How—a Tory, or, as we now
say, a Conservative paper, mind—on "Teachers of Local Cookery
hools,' signed " SPES," announces that at Darlington, Stockport,
Middlesborongh, and other plhces in the North, some sensible persons
are actively endeavouring to institute local schools of Cookery. Ton
will doubtless approve the suggestion of "SPES " that it is not only
?irls in elementary schools, but girls in "middle schools "—that is to
iay, School-board schools for general teaching—who require instruc-
tion in the art of preparing food:—
"A local school should provide for teaching both classes; and MB. Brcx-
MASTER, at one of the meetings to which we hare referred, says:—' A local
school should not exist for the instruction of children of the working classes
only, but the daughters of the middle and upper classes, and, indeed, any
class wishing for the instruction. It is the want of this knowledge which
makes mistresses dependent on their servant*.'"
Why, Sir, might you not have said all this yourself? and did you
aot, in tact, very often say the like in the course of your valuable
life: 1 ou know the concise Alderman who, being a man of more
wisdom than eloquence, exclaimed on an occasion, "I say ' ditto ' to
ME. BCTHKE!" Sir, you are eloquent, otherwise you likewise might
simply say " ditto " to what follows :—
"The school must be taught by a person who had not only passed the
technical and practical examinations at South Kensington, but who was able
to impart her knowledge to others in a pleasing and interesting manner.
Such a teacher should be received and treated as a Lady, supposing her to lie.
as she ought to be, a person of education and refinement, with whom no Lady
ought to be ashamed to associate. You can never elevate or improve the Art
of Cookery by despising the persons engaged in teaching it."
Them, Sir—pardon the vernacularism—them's your sentiments.
That is, if BOZZT has enabled us to divine them. Ton must know
that the MR. BUCKMASTEB referred to by " SPES," is a propagandist
of practical gastronomy, an expert and able philosopher, who goes
about doing good by lecturing on culinary science and art. You
perceive that a principal object of BUCKMASTEB'S labours is to train
ladies to be, so to speak, Buckmistresses—and what better right-
hand, I ask you, for a MaterfamiUaa 'f Mistress-cooks are rare. A
chef it ex vi termini, always a man. Master minds in cookery, as
in poetry, painting, and music, are specifically—genderically may
we say—masculine. Is cookery, then, one of the High Arts? Per-
haps; but until Ladies are taught that art as well as those others,
we cannot know that its highest range is above their powers. Mas-
culine ideas may be necessary for composing a symphony, but do
you not think due precept and practice should suffice to enable any
thinking woman to compose a salmi? Many women have an. apti-
tude for inventive cookery, as in the case of a Lady who did herself
the injustice of saying that she had made some mock-turtle out of
her own head. Surely, Sir, this aptitude has only to be duly culti-
vated to qualify any Lady endowed with it for appointments at Cluhs
and Hotels now entirely engrossed by the male sex, or to preside
over the kitchen as well as at the table of a rational husband, one
who, having known how to appreciate a real treasure, has insured
himself an antepast of your Elysian and ambrosial beatitude, Sir,
in the good things provided for him at homo, by the truly placens
uror, an educated woman whose education has rendered her, as a
thorough Cook, indeed an " Angel in the House."
LTTKLLIGENCE.—MB. WESTOJT, who has walked, and was
still walking when we last heard of him, so hard against Time,
declares he is not in the least sensible to the shock of the collision.
Will he never stop? It really looks like it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

The Flea also argued that no relation whatever ex-
isted between sixe and suffering. He was liable to be
cracked without the slightest compunction. If cracked
at all, why not under chloroform? He claimed .the same
consideration as his biggers.
Several Animals here rose at once, and said that Legis-
lation must draw the line somewhere. An uproar of
inarticulate noises ensued, and the Meeting broke up in
confusion.
SWEET SIMPLICITY.
Vifitor. "JANE, HAS TOVR MISTRESS OOT A BOOT-JACK?"
Maid-cf-att-Wurk. "No, SIR; PLEAS*, SIR, I CI/EAN AU, THE BOOTS, Sir.!"
THE ANTI-VIVISECTION MOVEMENT.
A MEETING of lower Animals to claim participation in any measure which
may be framed to regulate the practice of Vivisection, was held last evening at
the'-iEsopian Hall. A Pig was unanimously voted into the Chair.
The Pig complained that Pigs were subjected to death by most unpleasant
Vivisection. An incision was made through the Pig/s neck into a large vein,
and he was bled to death. He demanded that porcine Vivisection should be
performed under chloroform. Then, he shonld not mind. A Pig must die some-
how; and if under an antesthetie, after a good meal, he would as soon die as sleep.
The Eel wanted to know how much longer he was going to be skinned alive.
He wished to give the. most decided contradiction to the statement that Kuls
were used to it. He spoke on behalf of Fishes in general. It was as bad as any
Vivisection to be hooked on to a night-line, and remain so for hours.
The Earthworm had something to say to that. His own lot was still worse;
and the Eel might remember that ho owed all he got to biting at worms.
The Eel replied thnt, as tor that, it was only putting worms out of their misery.
The Earthworm would submit that fishing with ground-bait should be for-
bidden, and gardeners obliged to be careful in digging not to cut worms in two.
The Lobster wanted to know if the proposed Vivisection Bill would contain
any provision to protect him from liability to be boiled alive.
The Domestic Pigeon contended that being torn with shot which did not at
i >ne>- kill a bird, amounted to Vivisection of the very worst kind, for it had not
the excuse of shooting wild creatures for food, nor that of any scientific or other
useful object whatever.
The Sheep concurred with all that had fallen from the President the Pig.
He wished to know if mutton would be any the worse for being made under
laughing-gas?
The Calf desired-to extend the oliservations of the last speaker to veal. It
was cruel stinginess of butchers to grudge a poor animal a little nitrous oxide.
The Frog had been represented by some physiologists as a creature of what
1hcy called "low organisation.'7 They tried to make out that Vivisection did
not hurt him. He knew best, and he begged to differ from them.
The Beetle said he had SHAKSPKARE'S authority for the fact that when
trodden to death he suffered as much as Gog or Magog would. People should
mind how they walked; and he had quite as much right to protection as the
r'rog.
THE WRONGS OP OUR NATIVES.
(A Moom from the Molluscs of Milton.)
"NATURALISATION OF ALIENS.—Some revelations which are
calculated to surprise the oyster-eatiny community were made
yesterday in a ease which came before MR. RECORDER WEST at
the Manchester Quarter Sessions, involving a charge of theft
gainst one CHARLBS SMITH, employed as orstcrman at'The
Manchester (Limited)' restaurant below the'Royal Exchange.
On the 18th of January he got £i from the cashier to buy oysters,
but absconded with the money. On nil apprehension a month
later at Harrogate he denied the theft, and said he had left the
place because he was disgusted at having to supply Dutch oysters
as natives. The cashier and the manager of the restaurant
admitted, under eroM-eiamination by the prisoner's counsel,
MR. COTTINGHAM, that it was the practice to put Dutch oysters
into native shells, and sell them under the pretence that they
were native oysters. The manager stated he was the responsible
person, and'kept it quiet.' It was done at the suggestion of
the prisoner. The prisoner was found guilty, and was sent to
gaol for six months."
DEAR PUNCH,
We gape with indignation
At this appalling revelation!
Crossing in love we hold a trifle,
But this stirs wrath too strong to stifle.
We 've seen our race, by lovers' treason,
O'erdredged, and swallowed out of season;
We 've borne the sauce of vulgar rivals,
Though—thank our strength—we're still sur-
vivals—
But, by bur beards, this is too much—
To be translated to Low Dutch!
"What's six months for this worst of " sells,"
That serves up Dutch in Natives' sheila?
How could they hope to " keep it quiet,"
While England, like Worms, has a di«t?
Manchester of its taste cracks much;
But fancy DANDO done by Dutch .'
What is electoral personation
To this blow at onr reputation?
Aliens pretend to Native worth!
Then what is name or fame on earth?
Much it concerns the whole community
Suok a crime pass not with impunity'.
D«ar we-nray t»e, but we 're delicious;
And k*s we 'd fetch if less ym 'd fish ws.
Seasons too should share blame for thai!
How can we help short fails oi " spat" f
But Natives' character should stand-
Above all, in their native land—
At whate'er cost they show your dish on,
Like CAESAR'S wife, above suspicion!
Sure this worst form of personation
Asks the strong hand of legislation.
If they who personate electors
Have statutes, sentences, detectors,
What Act would be too bad for MM men
As dare for Natives pass off Dutchmen?
And though I thankllECORDEK WEST,
The muse of MILTON in my breast
Swells into protest at the thought
That such crime, to conviction brought,
But dooms the wretch to six months' prison
Who gives the Dutchman what's not his'n,
Bnt mine, the advantage of the favour
I owe to mv unrivalled flavour!
Then lay, 0 Punch, thy potent Insh
On him that, for vile greed of cash,
The worse for better oyster sells,
And plants intruders in our shells—
What doom's too bad for the low caitiffs
Who pass off Dutch for
Your own,
NATIVES!

THE SLEEPY HOLLOW OF SCIENCE.
A LECTURE on " The Paraffins and their Alcohols " was given the
other Friday evening by PROFESSOR ODLINO, in the Theatre of the
Royal Institution.
A lecture by a clever man on combustible matters, illustrated by
experiments, is peculiarly interesting to a popular audience. The
remark, therefore, below quoted from a report of PROFESSOR
On LINO'S discourse, may to some minds appear unaccountable, if not
a joke at the Professor's expense. Of paraffins the Lecturer had
said:—
"The lightest and most volatile varieties constitute benioline, a liquid of
many uses in the arts, but exceedingly dangerous for lamps."
His reporter continues :—
"PROFESSOR ODLINO placed a minute quantity on some cotton wool in a
jar of oxygen, allowed a few seconds for it to diffuse itself, and then applied a
match. A sharp, short, and very loud report resulted, the effect of which was
peculiarly observable on those of the audience who were unable to struggle
against the demand for an after-dinner doze."
Nobody, however, who has ever experienced a crowded theatre of
an evening at the Royal Institution will make the mistake of sup-
posing that PROFESSOR ODLDTG'S observations on paraffin had sent a
good many of his hearers to sleep. The demand for an after-dinner
doze on their parts was created not by scientific information, but by
carbonic acid £as, with which the atmosphere in the Theatre of the
Royal Institution is always loaded when full of people whose lungs,
by a law of nature, exhale that narcotic. What we learn from their
somnolence is not that PROFESSOR ODLING lectured in a somniferous
style, but that the Royal Institution remains unventilated, although
its Managers have had pointed put to them, what it is strange they
should need to be told, that their Theatre, a Theatre of Science in
general, and Physiology and Chemistry in particular, whenever
crammed, is crammed, literally, to suffocation.

The Great Divide.
THE EARL OF DUNRAVEN has chosen a subject for his new book
which will deeply interest all British matrons. Of course the object
of The Great Divide is to teach economy in the use of coals and
firewood. His Lordship would, however, do well to attend a Spelling
Bee, and he will then be able to announce his next edition under
its correct heading, with the "e" in the right place, and an
explanatory second title, i.e.,The Grate Divide; or. Hoio to Sare

Country during the Last Three Winters. But perhaps this"would
be more suitable to Lord Dundreary than LORD DUNRAVEN. Or,

Regards with amaze the present craze
Of what's called the public mind,
On a single fad the world run mad
"Tis no new thing to see;
Hut now 'tis insane upon fancies twain—
The Rink and the Spelling Bee.
Like droves and herds, and nocks of birds,
Like oxen, sheep, and swine,
And rooks and daws, whom an instinct draws
Together, how folks combine,
With one consent on a purpose bent,
For no reason the wise can see,
With a common crush as in crowds they rush
To the Rink and the Spelling Bee!
The human swarm will sometimes form
Intent on perilous ends;
But if spelling and skates have turned your pates,
That is all the harm, dear friends.
You indulge no vice on the mimic ice,
Or in mild orthographic',
And no naughtiness shames the popular gamis
Of the Rink and the Spelling Bee.
Our William's Last.
FA*CT What the Farmers will say to MH. GLADSTONE'S
late declaration that he derived more lively and unmixed
satisfaction "from the increase of the agricultural
labourer's wages "than from "any of the economical
changes he had lived to witness!" "Increase o'
labourer's wiges! Yah! Call that there a economical
change? Purty economy for we Farmers! There be'n't
many as 'ood practus the 'conomy o' spendun moor money
nor they could help. What's the differ'nce, at that
rate, 'tween economy and ixtravagance?" In these, or
similar observations, it may be feared that too many
agricultural gentlemen will criticise the epithet applied
in its philosophical sense by WILLIAM to increase of
wages.
ADVICE TO ASPIRANTS.—If you go in for a Spelling Bee,
and are brought down at the first shot, mind not to be
waspish.
CLUBS ARE TRUMPS.
Clubs are rising almost as rapidly as Rinks and faster than
mushrooms. An unsophisticated provincial may perhaps wonder
what denomination of mankind remains to be catered for. Mr. Punch
can answer his mute amazement with the following list of proposed
Clubs:—
"The Janus." Political. For unsiiccessful Candidates in Parlia-
mentary Elections, who are not quite decided as to what line they
may adopt when they next offer themselves to the Nation.
"The Brillantine." Social. For the younger members of the
highest Society, who find their partings not accurately defined at
TRrEFiTi's or'DOUGLAS'S. A staff of German shavers and French
hairdressers are engaged.
"The Wag arid Lavish." Military. For those Gentlemen who,
having strong military tastes, are, from failure in obtaining com-
missions in the Army, ineligible for election at the Army and Navy,
Junior ditto, United Service, Junior idem, Naval and Military,
Horse and Foot, Star and Garter, and other Clubs. No Servant of
this Club will address any Member otherwise than " Captain."
"The Tarbrush." Consolation. For Gentlemen who have been
blackballed at all other Clubs. Five blackballs insure admittance.
"The Ham-and-Eggs." Festive. Many Gentlemen having
complained that in no London Clnb oan they get a decent early
breakfast after leaving the Hyde Green whist-table at six o'clock
in the morning, this Club will be considered positively a sine and
nnn for men about Town, and breakfasts, at a moment's notice,
may be obtained here between 5 and 10 A.M. during the Season.
"The Worms." Ditto. A Club -which has long been wanted.
Where early birds, tnrned out of other Clubs by their absurd rules
and regulations, may find a snack and a pack of cards after 4 A.M.
"The Pavement." Good intentional. Only Gentlemen are eligible
who have sworn off plunging, whist, and ecartf, and have;made vows
to drink nothing stronger than giugerbeer. Spillikins the only
game allowed in the Club. Tea at any hour up ml twelve at night.
"The Alexandrine." Literary. It has long been a subject of
astonishment in literary circles that no Club has been started to
meet the requirements of Poets—a class now increasing every day.
This Club is opened to benefit the numerous disciples of Parnassus
who may not find their assthetical tastes appreciated by Club men of
other denominations. A Listener of long standing and great judg-
ment will be kept on the establishment. Members may introduce
Publishers as visitors at all hours. Hair-brushes not allowed.
"The Sable Stockings." Exclusive. Got up by Gentlemen who
have found it expedient to retire from the Hyde Green, Beziqne,
Br,ag, and other card-playing reunions. Members are allowed to
bring their own packs, bones, and^boxes.
Other Clubhouses top numerous to mention are in course of
con- and obstruction, with power to add to their number.

MR. PUNCH,
SIE,—I 'd like to know why we 're having all this bothera-
tion about the addition to the Royal Title? Sure HER MAJESTY
(long life to her!)'can do what she plases. It is not as if there
wasn't a new style convenient, and one that would flatther morv
than the Indies.
See here, Sir. Don't we all know the Emerald Isle is the finest
jool in the British Crown, and why wouldn't the QUEKBT be own in'
it? Sure, thin, isn't here an iligant title which would be aimiully
nate and appropriate for Ireland as for India—and that's the Paddy
Shah?
Should the Royal Titles Bill pass its Third Reading in the
Commons, LORD BROWNE AND OKANMORE might take the matter in
hand, when the Act reaches the Upper House.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

E may take comfort from LORD CABNABVON'S
assurance (Lords, Monday, March 13) that, if
the DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM, when Colonial
Secretary, did despotically abrogate the Con-
stitution of Heligoland, Heligoland has since
got on ever so much better for the loss of her
Constitution. She no longer shares the dis-
credit of Monaco, the Governor having done
-• *tx- . what her Constitutional Council would not—
put down her gaming-tables. A desultory talk
on Iron-clads, led off by LORD DUNSANT. "Why is it that on Naval Construction everybody thinks himself able to advise the Government?
What with Naval Lords, Naval Construction Board, Professional Advisers, Amateur Critics of the Royal Navy, the Merchant Service, and
all the Yacht Clubs, the Admiralty ought surely to be able to command the best advice. Punch never reads a Parliamentary dis-
cussion on the subject of ships and ship-building, and what the Admiralty ought to be and to do, but the moral of .iSsop's Ola Man
and his Ats is borne in strong on his mind.
(Common*.)—Nor was the thought of that pregnant apologue ever more present than to-night, when, after MB. BENTnrcic's
Resolution (that the First Lord of the Admiralty should be a Naval Officer) had been curtly, and with general consent, disposed of by 261
to 18, MB. DISRAELI having first elaborately smothered Big Ben under Blue Beoks, MB. REED applied his private and peculiar measuring
rod to our iron-clad sea-going Navy, and by excluding first one class of ships as too long, and another as too short, and a third an
too fast, and a fourth as too slow, or for some equally sufficient reason, brought down our fighting fleet to a poor dozen, and hence
concluded, to his own satisfaction, at least, that France, joined with either Germany, Russia, Austria, Turkey, or Italy would be more
than a match for Great Britain. Even Germany, Russia, and Austria—land-lubbers our JACKS have been accustomed to think
the smallest beer of—together were stronger on the Ocean than poor BBITANNIA, ex-Queen of the Sea! Our mle of the waves, in fact,
according to REED, is a lapsed legacy of the past, and an idle dream of the future, unless we lean on our REED as we ought, and go on
as he would have us, builaing more, and still more, Iron-clads of the kind he fancies. "Vous etes orfevre, Maitre Josse,'" You are
an iron-clad-ship-constructor. MB. REED. Not only do you believe in nothing but Iron-clads; but your faith in Iron-clads is apparently
confined to those of MB. REED'S building. Verbum sap. _
Till somebody will satisfy Mr. Punch that_ there is a vital distinction between land-fighting and sea-fighting, he must continue
to ask why the experience of armour on shore is so utterly inapplicable to the future of armour at sea? Why, if the Knight's steel-
coat was thickened and complicated till it fairly swamped the man inside, growing, at last, too heavy for any horse to carry, and too
cumbrous for any strength to wear, and wield weapons in, should not a similar danger be apprehended from thickening the armour-
plates of our men-of-war? So far from feeling with REED, Punch must own to deriving comfort from MB. WABD HUNT'S assurance
that for the present he means to confine the new ship-building work of the year to unarmoured vessels. We want eighty-four of these,
it seems, for the regular reliefs, and have only eighty forthcoming; so MB. HUNT has already made contracts for six gunboats and two
sloops, without waiting for leave of Parliament, and proposes to contract for twelve more gunboats, six corvettes, three sloops, and
four torpedo-vessels—in all 4,000 tons of new unarmoured craft to 5,200 of armoured ships now building under contracts of former
years. Altogether, if MB. HUNT asks for £11,400,000 of Navy Estimates, he shows us value received for it. And, as earnest of his
performance in the year to comet he informs us he has built up to within 450 tons of his programme in the year gone by. If Punch
could only, like the Iron Duke, sink the Vanguard, he would say, "Well done, WARD HUNT!" He not only spoke to the point, if
clumsily, on Monday, but showed a good tele of work done in the last twelve months. Altogether, spite of the Vanguard, &c., &c.,
&c., Punch feels more like trusting WARD HUNT than leaning on E. .1. REED. "Nothing like leather!" maybe a natural cry for

than in plates of iron, and in big guns than big ships.
Tuesday (Lords).—" Quistulerit Gracchos deseditionequerentes?"
Fancy LORD HALIFAX and the DUKE OF ARGYLL—two of the most
aggravatingest Indian Secretaries that ever nagged a Governor-
General and his Supreme Council to tearing of hair and gnashing of
teeth—united to wig the MARQUIS OF SALISBURY for dictation to
LORD NORTHBROOK, because he preferred other tariff reforms to the
remission of the 5 per cent, import duty on cotton goods! That the
Secretary of State for India must have some say in Indian Government,
is admitted. It needed no J. 8. MILL to come from the grave
to tell ns THAT. That, with the telegraph at his elbow to say
his say through, the Secretary of State is likely to say it more
promptly and peremptorily than always pleases a Governor-General,
is not surprising. Perhaps, in the instance specially complained of
by LOUD HALIFAX, LORD NORTHBROOK may have been right, and
the MARQUIS OF SALISBURY wrong. Doctors differ. But surely it
is rather unreasonable to complain of a Secretary of State suggesting
that it might be more convenient if important acts of Indian legisla-
tion were submitted to him, as a rule, for approval, before they are
passed in Council, rather than for veto after passing. Altogether, in
the night's debate LORD SALISBURY seemed to Mr. Punch to have
decidedly the best of it—whatever he may have had in his difference
with LORD NORTHBROOK.
(Commons.)—MR. _ CLARE REED enjoyed that pleasantest and
proudest of all positions—that of the martyr who can point to the
conversion of his persecutors to the faith he has suffered for. He
resigned Office because the Privy Council would not enforce uni-
form regulations for the slaughter of diseased cattle in Ireland
and England, and lo the Privy Council have agreed, as LORD SANDON
now announces to the House, to uniformity of regulation in the two
countries!
As MR. REED'S case was unanswerable, his triumph is complete;
and he has fairly earned the handsome testimonial which his friends
the tenant-farmers have subscribed to present him with.
He remarked significantly, in closing the debate, that all the
changes made by the Privy Council had been made since his resig-
nation in November. He has earned his little crow.
The Government has lost more in MR. REED than MR. REED in his
berth under the Government.
Wednesday.—A. wonder!—the Scotch Members divided among
themselves, over MR. M'CLAREN'S Bill for the Abolition of Church-
rates in Scotland. As the organs of Scotland's collective wisdom
always manage to agree among themselves when the object in view
is clearly ana demonstrably good, we conclude that MR. M'CLAREN'S
Bill was not of this kind; and that it was rejected by 210 to 155 for
good and sufficient reasons. . .
MR. EGERTON'S Bill for putting parishes into "mission " whose
parochial "black shepherds" neglect their pastoral charge, was
talked out.
Punch is rather at a loss whether to condole with MR. EGEHTON,
or to rejoice for JOHN BULL that another Clerical bone of contention
is not to be added to the heap already collected: but he is disposed
to think that the measure might have done good in some cases, and
that some of the black shepherds it aimed at might be the better for
its rod being hung up over their irreverend heads.
Thursday (Lords).—The LORD CHANCELLOR'S Bill for lopping the
too luxuriant branches of the Irish Judicature. The twenty-three
judges are to be cut down to twenty.
Et tu, Brute.' Then die, Irish Conservatism!
The changes suggested seem called for. But let us hear what
Ireland—above all, the Irish Bar—may have to say to them, and then
cut away, CAIRNS!
(Commons.)—Second Reading of the Royal Titles Bill. The Leader
of Her Majesty's Opposition gave voice to the general feeling
in his Amendment that "it is inexpedient to impair the ancient
and Royal dignity of the Crown by the assumption of the style and
title of ' Empress.'" But MR. DISRAELI persevered, in spite of

rather for Queen than Empress, had no very strong feeling in the

honour her, with a new and unfamiliar title, of doubtful antecedents
and objectionable associations. So far as Air. P. can feel Jons

Friday (Lords).—Crossed Cheques Bill passed. May all who haye
had crosses and checks in life henceforth find them coupled in the
pleasant guise of crossed cheques.
Bill authorising Pensions to three Members of the Council of India.
LOUD SALISBURY admits that, if he had his way, he would have
Members of the Council appointed for life, leaving it to themselves
to retire and draw their pensions when they felt no longer fit for
service. That would he the handsomest arrangement in the case of
such men as deserve to fill seats in the Council, and so give the last of
their lives to the public service. But what would MR. RyLAlfDs say
to it?
(Commons).—Sharp attack on MB. SCUDAMOHE. All his figures, in
connection with the purchase of the Telegraphs, called over the
coals—his estimates of cost contrasted with actual payments—those
of revenue with actual returns, and general cawing of the croakers
over what they are delighted to call the failure of a great experi-
ment. They crow best who crow last. MR. SCUDAMORE, and the
Purchase of "the Telegraphs—can both wait for time to justify them.
En attendant, LORD JOHN MANNERS said what he could in anti-
cipation of time. So Manners, ye cavillers, and croakers! Be of
good cheer, SCUDAMORE!
MR. MELDON on the insufficient salaries of Irish National School
Teachers. On this one point, and only this, all who wish well to
Ireland are of one mind. Whether out of voluntary or compulsory
rates, imperial taxes, or school pence, the salaries of Irish National
School Teachers have got to be raised. The Government seems to
feel it; so Punch hopes he may live to see it.
''LINKS WITH THE PAST."
To the Editor of Punch.
IR,
I BELONG to a singu-
larly long-lived race. My
great grandfather lived
to be ninety-seven, my
grandfather was an un-
questioned centenarian,
my father would have
been able to claim the
same distinction if gout
had not carried him off
somewhat prematurely,
and I myself am now in
my ninety-second year—
writing, as I think you
will admit, an extraordi-
nary hand for one so far
advanced in life. I can-
not remember my great-
grandfather, but the
family tradition has never
wavered that he was an
eye-witness to SIR WAL-
TER RALEIGH laying down
his cloak in the mud for
QUEEN ELIZABETH to step
upon. My grandfather,
whom I am said strongly
to resemble, distinctly re-
collected the wart on OLIVER CROMWELL'S face, and had often
escaped from his nurse's charge to see CHARLES THE SECOND
feeding the ducks in St. James's Park. I think the event which had
left the deepest impression on my father's mind was his being hoisted
on the shoulders of "BEN," the old family coachman, to admire the
illuminations for the Battle of Blenheim.
Here, then, you have only four generations from ELIZABETH to

But I am not writing to you to gossip about my own reminiscences,
but rather to inform you that my mother's sisters (AUNT GRISELDA
and AUNT JANET) danced with the young Chevalier, and a Gentle-
man, who, from their description, I think must have been Mr.
Waverley, at the ball given at Holyrood, in the eventful '45. We
have still in our possession a few grains of snuff, which fell from
the Prince's Vernit Martin tabatiere on that memorable occasion.
I would enclose some for your inspection, but the precious powder
[an heirloom) is in the muniment-room, at our family seat in Mid-
Lothian; and I write this hasty note from Torquay, where I am
wintering.
Ever yours, my dear Mr. Punch,
FLORA MAC JAHVIE.
I enclose my photograph, untouched.
MR. PUNCH,
I AM eighty-four, and can still play the flute. My foster-
brother is eighty-two, and able to read the smallest print without
glasses. My mother-in-law, who was ninety when she died (after
living with us for more than half a century), rode to market on a
pillion in the last year of her life. One of my sponsors attained the
extraordinary age of ninety-nine, and never took a dose of medicine
or wore a great coat. The husband of my eldest sister, now in his
seventy-ninth year, gets up at six winter and summer, and practises
for an hour with the dumb-bells. Not to weary you with too
many details, my step-father, when he was considerably over foxir-
score, walked from Putney to Mortlake and back on the day of the
great boat-race, and afterwards dined at the " Star and Garter" at
Richmond, and played three rubbers in the evening.
If there is any other family which can pretend to so much
longevity and vigour in its different members, I shall be surprised,
and not altogether pleased.
Yonrs faithfully, SENEX.

I HAVE seen the last link-boy and the first gas-lamp, the
last watchman and the first policeman, the last mail-coach from
London to Dover, and the first tram-car from Westminster to Brix-
ton, the last pig-tail and the first wide-awake; the last Bishop who
looked awful in a wig, and the first servant girl who made herself
ridiculous with a chignon.
I have handled snuffers, lit my pipe with a tinder-box, been
carried in a sedan-chair, worn powder and a night-cap, slept in a
bed warmed with a warming-pan, carried my watch in my fob.
pulled a bell-rope down, fastened letters with wafers and dried
them with pounce, eaten my dinner oif a pewter plate, pursued peas
with a two-pronged fork, and for many years taken a bottle of port
after dinner without experiencing any inconvenience.
I have seen the first envelope, the first postage-stamp, the first
mateh striking exclusively on its own box, the first photograph, the
first perambulator, the first breechloader, the first Great Exhibition,
the first croquet match, the first " Ulster," and the first Number of
Punch.
I think you will agree with me that my Links both with the Past
and the Present are sufficiently striking to be noticed in your
columns. What will they be with the Future P Even your prescient
eye may here acknowledge some indistinctness of vision. TJut is it
very venturesome to connect with the coming time submarine tun-
nels, and sea voyages smooth and agreeable as a summer's evening
excursion on the Thames, and reasonable hotels, and comfortable
hats, and clean swept streets, and the final extinction of parochial
misgovernment in the Metropolis?
Tours, p. p. p.
P.S. — My father has often told me that, when he was a boy, he
used to go Dird-nestinT with another boy whose father, when he was
a boy, bird-nested with a young companion of his own age, whose
grandfather was the first person to cultivate potatoes in his own
garden. Few " Links with the Past" can, I think, compete with
this in interest.

OME may ask, What's in a
Name? In these things
everything's in a name.
Association and sympathy
gather round these ancient
names, and it is these things
which constitute the national
spirit and the continuity of
national life. Patriotism
and loyalty—sentiments the
strongest in our nature—are
made of these ancient asso-
ciations. It is for these things
that great men have been

JOHN BULL (loquitur)—
DON'T like it, that1

why.
They -wonder
SIB. STAFFORD says it's
all unreasoning panic.
Perhaps. Yet stick to
the old "Queen"
say I.
No mixture of the Im-
perial or Sultanic
Should taint that ancient title. I woula drink
Still to the good old toast—" The QUEEN! God bless her I"
But " Empress "—'tis a word from which I shrink—
A name by which I 'd rather not address her.
"What's in a name?" Well I suspect there's much,
I ar more than is accounted for by reason;
But there are things 'twere hardly well to touch
With Logic's fingers. Fellows who spout treason
Might say that Loyalty is but a name
For something rather baffling definition—
Mere sentiment. It rules us all the same,
Spite of the sumphs who dub it Superstition.
"What's in a name?" Well, there's association
Still counts for something. Did it not, confound it!
Society were pure chaos. Should the nation
Snap the old well-loved links that long have bound it
In ordered freedom, loyal ranks well ranged,
Before they rind the bond to be a fetter?
Not so! Nor should the Royal badge be changed
Until we 're very sure we ve found a better.
"No change—addition only "? Well, I 'm bad
At logic-chopping, but that statement strikes me
As much like quibble. I 'd be vastly glad
To please HER MAJESTY; but this mislikes me,
I must confess. An Orient alias
Tagged to her grand home-title's not precisely
The sort of compliment I 'd choose to pass
On one I love so well, and—I hope—wisely.
"India craves it?" Well, I have my doubts
If those who say so can read India rightly.
I thank her for her loyal shows and shouts,
But yet would wish to intimate—politely—
That, though her wants and wishes have all claim
Upon my thought and care, 'tis my opinion
The British Empire's Mistress bears a name
Grand enough e'en for the Mogul's dominion.
I 'm for the QUEEN! Two titles might get mixed
In course of time, and—well, with names, the bigger
Mostly gets foremost. BEN, your aim seems fixed,
_But pause a moment ere you pull the trigger.
You may bring down much more than you intend;
The QUEEN, as England's Queen, rules England's realm:
ror guide and guard her empire to defend,
Loyalty at its heart, Law at its helm!

"'WANTED, a General Servant, one who can neither Read nor Write
preferred. She must be clean, obliging, willing, and honest. Good wages
given.—Apply personally, to M., Post Office, &c.'
"Would cleanness, obligingness, willingness, and honesty be any the worse
with reading and writing? Let us hope that, if the former qualifications
were found in the applicant to ' it.,' the reading and writing would not be
fatal—disqualifications!"
They have elicited this plain-spoken letter:)
SIB,
IN answer to your query, allow me to state,' briefly, that
atter twelve years' experience as the Mistress of a Household,
numbering from five to eight domestics, I unhesitatingly affirm that
those who have been innocent of the three It's, were invariably the
most industrious, and the most honest. Instead of reading my
letters, and rewriting their own—of the Cook basting her joint
with one hand, and her eyes on a greasy cheap pamphlet held in
the other (a fact), of the Housemaid carelessly dusting my drawing-
room with a feather-brush, and then spending the hour she had .
gained in my rocking-chair reading some mawkish novel, pregnant
with evil results, my ignorant servants have been faithful to their
duties, respectful, and respectable; and this, I think, is the expe-
rience of thousands.
With every wish of good Mistresses to be considerate to their
servantSj their homes are hives for labour, not houses for idlers to
lounge in; and with every deference to the great and good in
our land, who have endeavoured to ameliorate the condition of the
poorer classes, my experience tells me, and my ordinary sense
shows me, that with regard to female servants, their efforts are
monstrous failures.
My sympathies are entirely with the Advertiser " M," whom you
hold up to scorn ;* and I think I should find an ally in Mrs. Jitrf//.

PAIRING AND REPAIRING.
THE reasons inducing two young people to enter the holy bonds of Matrimony have hitherto, as a rale, been love, interest, intellectual
sympathy, compatibility of temper, parity of social rank, and so forth. Now, Mr. Punch (who is an inveterate match-maker) thinks it high
time these selfish and old-fashioned notions as to what constitute mutual fitness for the married state should be improved away, in the interests
of the Anglo-Saxon race. He begs to present his readers with a sketch of two prize couples, exhibited by him (in imagination) at a "Married
Couple Show " (evolved from his own inner consciousness), and earnestly commends the same to the thoughtful study of the youth of England.
And oh ! should one single misguided pair of gifted but dyspeptic enthusiasts be induced hereby to forego their intention of taking each other
for better for worse—should one single splendid champion of the river and the cricket-field, on contemplating the above, transfer his affections
from some simple-minded and congenial linker to some such inspired little being as that who divides the first prize in the picture—Mr. Punch
will not have thought and wrought in vain. Verbum sap.
"THE MORE HASTE THE WORSE SPEED."
SCENE—The Charing Cross Station of ihe District Railway.
Country Cousin bound fur Say/swater, to 1'icket Clerk, with
scrupulous politeness. If you please, I want a first-class ticket to
Bays water.
Ticket Clerk (abruptly). No first-class here. Go to the next
booking-place.
[Country Cousin retires rebuffed, and finds his way to next
booking-place.
Country Cousin. If you please, I want a first-class ticket to
Bayswater.
Ticket Clerk (explosively). Single or return? Look sharp!
You 're not the only person in London!
Country Cousin (humbly). Single, please.
[The ticket and change are slapped down unceremoniously, and
Country Cousin is shoved on from behind-by an impatient
City man. Hushes precipitately down brass-bound steps,
ana presents his ticket to be snipped.
Snipper (inspecting ticket). Queen's Kontl, Bayswater? Wrong
side! Go up the stairs, and turn to the right. Look sharp!
There's a train just coming in!
[Country Cousin, with a deepened tense of humiliation and be-
wilderment, hurries up-stairs, turns to the right, and
reaches entrance to platform just in time? to have gate
slammed in his face. The train being gone, gate is re-
opened, and the necessary snipping performed on his ticket.
Country Cousin (to Snipper, politely). If you please, will the next
train take me to Queen's Road, Bayswater r
Saturnine Official. Can't tell you till the train comes.
[Country Cousin paces the platform in moody silence, and wishes
he had taken a cab.
Enter Train, rushing madly along.
Stentorian Voice (without stops). Earl's Court North End and
Hammersmith Train first and second-class forward third behind!
[Country Cousin makes his way towards a carriage, but finds it
full. Tries another with the same result, and is frantically
endeavouring to open the door of a third-class compartment
in which there is one vacant seat next a fat woman with a
baby, when train mores on.
Indignant Official. Stand away there! Stand away, will you!
(Drags back Country Cousin.) That ain't your train! What do you
want a-trying to get in there for?
[Country Cousin, in deeper humiliation, re-arranges dress, dis-
turbed by recent struggle, and resumes his agitated march.
Enter another Train more madly than the first.
Stentorian Voice. High Street Kensington Netting Hill Gate and
Bayswater train Main Line train!
Country Cousin (to Haughty Official, in an agony of entreaty).
Is this train for Queen's Road, Bayswater?
Haughty Official. Yes, Queen's Road. Look sharp I She "11 be off
in a minute.
[Country Cousin scrambles through the crowd to a carriage:
drops his umbrella: stoops to pick it up, and on rising finds
train three parts through the tunnel. Exit Country Cousin
in a rage, to get a cab, having lost twenty minutes, the price
of his unused ticket, his self-respect, and that of everybody
he has come in contact with in the Metropolitan District
Railway Station.

GONE WRONG!
A NEff NOVEL. BY MI33 RHODY DKNDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh Down like a. Shower," "Red in the Nose i
"Good/ Buy Sweet Tart!" "Not Sltiy, Put don't Tell."
CHAPTER I.— mat Jenny says.
On the Sea! the Sea! the open, the unpallmg, the unfriendly,
the unequal, the billowous, unsmooth, the unfailing, the unsteady,
the unboundless, the fishful yet porpoiseless, the unshrimping, the
unawhaling Sea!
Grand weather for poor little despised "Wollum, on the low coast
of the Fullum Roads, within full view of the far-stretching Shell
Sea. Poor little Wollum! Few people know it, fewer still love it.
Pierless "Wollum! with its swarms oi flies drawn to the place by one
horse, and its neat little wheel Bruif um machines, at so much an
hour not including the driver. Fresh, sparkling Wollum! with its
leafy glades, where the loving trees twine their lissom arms above
the low-voiced 'busman's head, and kiss one another in the shady
twilight.
And so on the Green—the Green of Wollum—old, froggy-blooded
people tottered, and bashed, and the marine-coated policeman
cracked a nut or two for sheer wantonness, shading his eyes from
the fierce darts of the great sun-god, and peered in the direction of
the old Knight's Bridge on the one side, the Reach of Putterney on
the other, or out on to the horizon-bound Shell Sea.
The small first-floor of a small Wollum Green House; its tem-
perature up to one hundred in the shade; a temple dedicated to
rich odours and brave tints; and, in this room, we two sisters, the
two MISSES ST. JOHN VILLAHS.
JENNY—I am JENNY—is engaged in the interminable work of knit-
ting sand-ropes whereon to string the highly-scented, nature-favoured
apple-beads of Shalotte. JENNY is the elder of the two. She is a
young old maid, and likely to remain so, as her figure has long since
passed the turning-point, the embonpoint, of comeliness; and young
men with short crisp hair, grand broad chests, clean-shaped limbs,
muscles of iron, and no sinews of tin in their composition with their
creditors, are not likely to be enticed by the matrimonial advertise-
ments of a poor, but respectable, family inviting them to " Try our
Stout JANE!"
Let us go to the other—as men always did—BELLA ST. JOHN
"ViLLABs. BELLA, is our youngest born, and the show one of the
family. She is not in a particularly graceful attitude just now, and
yet there is a certain charm in it, which would make male passers-by
look twice—three times—perhaps even four times, at the two round
greyish-green eyes deep set and as full of sweetness as un-shelled
peas; and a fifth time would men of maturer age glance at the
plump white arms, hanging lazily out of the window, playing with
her tresses of bright hair, which she is swinging, to and fro, in the
softly-caressing breeze. Neither wholly red, nor purely golden,
are her electro-plaited locks, which gleam with all the brilliancy of
an autumn walnut in a dank wood. She is just settling in her mind
which colour it is to be, and has done her sister the honour of con-
sulting her. She makes a soft pillow for her little glossy head on
the window-sill. Thought made her head ache.
"I do not want to dye yet!" she murmured plaintively.
"There is no necessity for it," I say. I always say whatever
BELLA wishes—it is my role in life, and I take a good look at her as
she twines her shapely fingers in among her sunset tresses. She
has big grey eyes, in which, at first sight, there appears to be a
considerable amount of green. She has the small upward turned
nose of a person who is passing through Cologne, or through a back
street of the Seven Dials in the hottest summer time, with two little
heart-shaped, dimpled nostrils, that are very extinguishers for
men's souls. Her laughing full-blown lips form an elastic frame-
work to a gorgeous mouth, which could scarcely be measured with
the^breadth, or length, of two table spoons, and enough to make a
selfish man of large appetite (and most men have both qualifica-
tions) pause before inviting her to dine with him on the remains of
yesterday's meal tete-d-tSte in his luxurious bachelor lodgings.
All men who looked once at BELLA'S mouth, thought twice. It
seemed to expect life to be one long pleasant dinner of ever-varving
dishes, with luscious fruits for the dessert, and then the whole
movement da capo from the potage d la Heine.
There is a lurking gravity in her low forehead which most men
have wondered at; and her full, unblushing cheek, men admire
still more, but wonder at less. This face is nicely set on a warm
round throat, not too white, nor like unliving marble, but like a
large, well-turned, soft, consistent roley-poley pudding, with the
veins of raspberry jam within, indicated on its warm, soft surface.
As for BELLA'S figure,—well, she has told me, her Sister JENNY,
that five thousand a year would be about her figure, if the parti
were in other ways suitable. But there is no depending upon the
whims and fancies of this soft, undulating, plump, dumpling-like
•girl, who is fascinating all round, and whose whole contour, what-
ever our family lineage may be, would never induce an antiquarian
to believe in her having been descended from the Angles, though
indeed, some observant naturalists, or logical theologians, holding
severally the theories of evolution or development, might have
arrived at a somewhat different opinion. But all this is too hig^h for
me, who am only Sister JENNY, and, physically speaking, a failure.
BELLA wears a pretty little dress of Japanese silk; of so simple
a pattern as to consist of only three figures crossing a bridge, two
people in a boat, a quaint tree with large blue apples, a sort of
pagoda, two brilliantly plumaged birds fighting in the air, and that
is all. It is too plain and quiet to suit most people; it becomes her
marvellously, and, being drawn in slightly at the girdle, gives a
truer expression to her healthily firm and shapely shoulders, than
many a grander garment would have done.
There she sits, lazy, happy, passive; a pretty dollop of colour on
the grey stone window-sill of our first-floor front.
"I wish I had something to eat!" she exclaims, wearily. "This
air gives me an appetite, especially out here "(As I nave inti-
mated, she is on the window-sill, and throwing these remarks into
the room to me.) "I sent TOMMY out to buy some jelly and a
pickled cabbage. Where is he?"
"Good Heavens!" I exclaim—I generally exclaim ' Good Hea-
vens !'—" you don't suppose the unhappy imbecile is so infatuated
as to run about Wollum with pickled cabbages and jellies in his
pocket?"
"Yes, I do," she returns triumphantly, "and ices too, and sponge-
cakes, and buns, and nuts. What s he made for, if not to be useful?"
I am about to attempt an answer to this problem, when the sound
of a concertina strikes our ears.
BELLA starts up, and holds on by the window-sash, craning her
neck out to look round the corner of the next balcony, and down the
street, a few yards distant.
"Here he is!" she cries. "He is always playing the same tune,
that is, as much as he knows of it." (It is Pretty Jemima, don t
say 'No!'" and we both recognise it.) "And—oh!" she cries,
almost bounding off her perch, "he 's got some one with him! A
Man! such a Man! Oh, I do hope he is going to bring him up
here!"
I look out of window, and see TOMMY—that is, our friend, the
REV. THOMAS HASSOCK, who is taking care of us at the seaside—in
his long clerical coat, high waistcoat, large white tie, and big, soft,
pulpy, slouched hat, dancing about in the middle of the road, playing
the concertina; his little pink eyes thrown up, beseechingly, through
his pale green spectacles, towards the object of his loving worship,
eager for one smile—for one slight glance of approval, or even of
recognition, of his attempts to please and amuse her.
But BELLA'S eyes are turned in another direction. For a time
she is apparently utterly ignorant of the very existence of the
REV. THOMAS HASSOCK, and as deaf to the voluptuous harmony of
his concertina, as she had been, for months past, to the theme of his
pitiful entreaties. It is a Man who has attracted her attention;
and even I, with all my old-maidish contempt for the sex, am
forced to admit that BELLA is a connoisseur ql this portion of the
creation, and that she is right in refusing this title to poor fluffy-
headed, green-spectacled, whimpering Reverend little TOMMY, who
would play and dance himself to death in the broiling sun on the
Wollum Green, if thereby he could hope to win from her one word
of love.
"Come in!" She beckons imperiously to the infatuated dancing
Clergyman, with a whisk of her dimpled, white, plump finger cutting
his capers short.
TOMMY obeyed instantly.
In another second he is in our room.
"Where 's your friend P " BELLA asks.
"Outside," answers TOMMY, blushing, and smoothing his curly
straw-coloured hair with the corner of his concertina.
"Why didn't you bring him up ?" BELLA inquires.
"He is old enough to have brought me up," replies TOMMY, turn-
ing all manner of colours, and pulling out a chord from his instru-
ment.
"You are such a donkey, TOMMY!" says BELLA, throwing at his
head a thick cushion on which she has been sitting. The cushion
caught the REV. MR. HASSOCK on his right ear, and brought him
suddenly to tie ground.
"Never mind, I say, trying to soften matters—it is my mission
in life to soften matters—" she does not mean it."
"You know, MRS JENNY." the poor creature says to me, "I would
do anything for BELLA. If she told me to stand on my head I
would-do it."
"Don't call me BELLA," says the young lady, sharply. "And
doit."
"Stand on my head?"
"Yes."
He requires no further pressure. He is on his head, with an
±ity which shows he has prepared for this occasion, and is turning
rly round and round, following with his spectacles BELLA into
whatever part of the room her sudden impulsive walk may take her.

(See " Wrongs of Our Natives."—Punch, March 18.)
DEAB PUSCH,
WE hope, in this Metropolis,
They play no tricks of Calicopolis:
But we, plain Dutchmen dare to say
We are of real use to-day;
Nor to you only Mr. Punch,
Who. haying had your oyster-lunch,
Resolve it into purest pearls
For thoughtful men and laughing girls.
We cry, Come; eat us! Let the best,
Who boast the Natives' choicest zest,
Awhile beneath the ocean rest.
To them we claim not to be equal,
Yet eat us, and await the sequel."
Once, if we credit Roman stories,
Ceteris ostriosior ori»
Was the far-famed Rutnpian marge
Where Latian epicures at large
Enjoyed a British oyster-supper,
When HORACE reigned instead of TUPPEE.
But oh the oysters night and day
Eaten, since CJESAR came this way!
Since Roman gourmands, growing boisterous,
Swore that Olympus was an oyster-house,
That Hermes opened bivalves well,
And always in the concave shell;
That Zeus, almighty self-refector,
When eating them abjured his nectar,
Thought Ganymede a clumsy lout,
And wisely called for London stout.
Natives no longer are abundant;
We, by comparison, redundant,
Not caring, though with scorn you treat UB,
"Come, ope," we cry, " come, ope, and eat us!"
Trust not the men who, fond of " sells,"
Translate us into Native shells;
But gulp us in an honest way,
And, having done it, you will say,
"'Twere wiser to grant breathing time,
For Natives to regain their prime,
Nor, while we spare them, scorn too much
The plump and modest Anglo-Dutch."
The doings of Mancestrian folk
Are, we admit, beyond a joke,
But we are not in league with such men:
We 're honest, unpretending

Then she stops, and speaks, before releasing him.
"You 'd better stay as you are. For months you have been ' off
your head.' Your parishioners will be glad to hear you are on it
again. Tell me what's your friend's name?"
TOMMY, having righted himself once more, produces from his
pockets a pickled cabbage, some ices in brown paper, a bottle of
ginger-beer, two jam tarts, and a sausage-roll. These he offers to
BELLA.
"I thought," stammers the timorous little man, "I once heard
you say you liked them."
She puts them aside, and repeats her question—" Tell me his
name?1'
He answers, "DUSOVER HKUAIIUK."
What is he?"
'A Captain."
'A Captain! I shall go out for a drive with him."
'Good Heavens!" I exclaim.
'My dear Miss BELLA," says TOMMY, nervously, drawing out one
long expostulatory note on his concertina, and twisting round slowly
on one leg. as he sings, in a high, but not positively unmusical
voice, "What will Mamma say? What will Papa say? Oh my,
fie for shame! What will Mam"
But a mischievous, tormenting look flashes into BELLA'S grey eyes.
"Take off your coat and hat!" says the wilful girl, in a calm,
determined tone, to TOMMY; who stands aghast—"Take off your
coat, hat, waistcoat, and white tie! I am going for a drive with
CAPTAIN DUSOVER BELJAMBE!"
(To b« continued.)
WHAT IT SEEMS LIKELY TO COME TO.
THE Lords Commissioners of Her Majesty's Treasury contemplate
the opening of Westminster Hall as a Skating Rink, for the use of
Members of both Houses, the Bench, and the Bar.
The Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's hope shortly to be able to
announce the opening of their new Skating Rink, in the Cathedral
crypt, for the use of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons.
Loggia and box-holders at the Albert Hall, who have converted
their property into private Rinks, are requested to abstain from
skating during the few remaining Concerts which will take place
before a Bill is applied for to authorise the adaptation of the Hall
as a Metropolitan Rink for the use of the British Public.
The President and Members of the Royal Academy of Arts
beg to inform Exhibitors that their entrance cards will admit them
to the new Art Rink, to be constructed in the courtyard of Burlington
House previous to the opening of the Exhibition.
The Zoological Society is about to turn the Fish House into a
Skating Rink. Lessons will be given by the Polar Bears.
Conservative Notions.
IT is understood that, should the sanction of Parliament be given
to the Ministerial proposal of adding the new and foreign denomi-
nation of Empress to HEB MAJESTY'S old English title of Queen,
MR. DISRAELI will shortly ask the House of Commons to vote a sum
of money for the purpose of whitewashing Westminster Abbey.

said to have been planted by the dueen of CHARLES THE SECOND.
If so, and the caitiff is only quick enough about his work, he will be

THE following note occurs in a column of Southampton news :—
"CHARLES EDWARDS is announced to give Gospel addresses in the new
Skating Rink to-morrow (Sunday) afternoon and evening."
To serve the purpose of MR. EDWARDS, a Skating Rink seems
about as fit as a Circus; but authority for preaching both in season
and out of season may equally warrant preaching whether in or out
of place. However, perhaps a sermon would not be quite out of
place in a Skating Rink, where it might touch backsliders.
Elementary Education.
THE Elements of late have been unusually unruly. Meetings
to promote Elementary Education have had not the slightest effect
in restraining their violence, so as to keep them from tearing tele-
graphic wires, and throwing tiles and chimney-pots. There are
Elements which nobody as yet has been able to master; hence the
late tempestuous weather. Better luck to the efforts of philanthro-
pists to educate the people.
Proposal to Parliament.
IN order to the more effectual exclusion of private jobbery from
Parliamentary proceedings, suppose you resolve that anj; Honourable
Member accepting office as a Railway Chairman or Director, shall
by the fact of so doing, like the receiver of a Ministerial appoint-
ment, vacate his seat, and ere he is permitted to resume it, have to
offer himself for re-election.

[MARCH 25, 1876.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

PERFORMANCES IN LENT.
THE Hampshire Independent,
utfder heading of Lenten
Missions at Southampton,"
reports the particulars of
certain proceedings lately
conducted at various
churches in that town and
its neighbourhood by cer-
tain "mission preachers,"
invited by some thirtv
Clergymen, who, "headed
by the Rural Dean, the
KEY. DR. CARY, approached
the LORD BISHOP OF WIN-
CHESTER, and obtained his
sanction and warm approval
of a series of Services to be
held during the iirst eight
_r; or ten days of the present
Lent." Somo of these pro-
ceedings would once have
been deemed prodigious,
and not merely extraordi-
nary; but in these days
wo are accustomed to no-
tices of Theatres Clerical,
such as the following ac-
count of a performance at—
"ST. MICHAEL'S CHURCH.—Those who, knowing the Ritualistic tendencies
at this church (REV. F. M. GREGORY'S), expected that the Mission would be
accompanied by extravagances, were not disappointed. The notices, announ-
cing the Services stated the Mission Priests will bo ready to hear confessions,
or to give spiritual direction after any of the Services, with the Service for
the renewal of baptismal vows."
The acting at the REV. F. M. GREGORY'S Church, where " Mission
Priests" attended to hear confessions, if truly described, was verv
close to the real thing indeed. Mn. GREGORY appears to have played
the part of a provincial POPE GREGORY in capital style. This is
further apparent from what follows:—
"On Saturday evening the Missioners (REVS. R. LINKLATER and L. N.
JONES) were met by the Vicar and choristers at the old parsonage house,
where a procession was formed, and headed by one of the choristers bearing
aloft a jewelled crucifix, they proceeded to the church, singing, ' Onward,
Christian soldiers!'"
These soldiers, however, seem unaware that they are troops with
whom the genuine Pope's Own would not march through Coventry,
nor would have marched through Southampton.
A " service," we are told, was next " conducted" by MR. GREGORY
—playing Anti-Pope, perhaps, rather than POPE GREGORY, as the
Ritualists disobey Pius. It was "taken from the Book of the
Mission" :—
"In this book the advantages of coming to confession are set forth, with
directions 'how to make a good confession,' in which an admonition is given
'not to keep back anything,' to ' take care to be plain and simple, and if you
find it difficult, to ask the priest to help you;' 'if you doubt whether any-
thing you have done was sinful, ask the priest;' 'keep to the point, and
remember you have to confess your own sins, not the sins of other people;'
'make your confession as if it were your last, and you were going to die to-
night.' Then is given the following form of confession."
This was simply the Roman preamble to auricular confession
slightly garbled to suit the Ritualistic stage. It is followed by
the direction, "Thon tell th« nriest. vnnr sins" nnrl tlinf dnn»
finally, to pri
absolution.''
Might not the penitent, told not to confess the sins of other
Then tell the priest your sins," and, that done,
"you, my father, to give me penance, counsel, and
people, as well consider how far he is sure that his own will not be
divulged by his mimic " Father Confessor"? There is nothing to
prevent a Ritualist from being a hypocrite; nor are there in the
laws of the Church by Law Established any provisions to regulate
the practice of "Confession," which, as a practice, that Church
ignores. No such provisions are likely to be made by Act of Parlia-
ment, and even if the Bishops could be prevailed to frame any,
what Ritualist—each his own Pope—could be trusted to obey Kis
Bishop? Let boobies, therefore, beware how they play at auricular
confession.
The thirty odd Hampshire parsons have "approached" the
BISHOP OF WINCHESTER to such purpose that next, instead of
warily "approaching" him—getting at him in a gradual and
tentative manner—they will perhaps at once peremptorily request
him to patronise their sacerdotal performances. If the REV. MR.
GitEflORY, of Southampton, for instance, has the courage of his
opinions, will he hesitate to apply to his Diocesan for a faculty to
erect a Confessional in St. Micha'cl's Church? For that purpose,
however, the mere faculty of imitation will not do.
AN EDUCATIONAL NORTHERN LIGHT.
IN these days, when the Schoolmaster is so much abroad, what a
comfort to know that even where School Boards are not spread, the
banquet of instruction is readv for the children of the humbler as
well as the highest orders. And what instruction! Take as an
example the following bond fide educational menu—actually put
forth by a North Country Schoolmaster—which has been sent to
Mr. Punch, and which he reproduces textually.
"MR. now ventures to commend his scholastic attainments to the
inhabitants of the neighbourhood of , feeling confident he has made him-
self master of a good sound English education, after pursuing the above object
many years—nevertheless returns his sincere thanks to those who have
favoured him with their patronage and yet earnestly solicits a favour of
greater patronage feeling assured that by strictness, perseverance, economy
and wonted ability he will give satisfaction to both sexes in tuition and also
to parents by imparting to their Children a liberal Education, consisting of
Reading, Writing, Grammar, Geography, Arithmetic in all its extensive
branches and powers, also Mathematics and Drawing.
"N.B.—MR. deems it highly necessary to remark that it is a matter
of great materiality regarding the progress in any boy or girl being absent at
school, as their progress entirely depends on their attendance, if the Teacher
do his duty, and it i§ an undeniable fact that Learning cannot be acquired
unless attention be paid, hence MR. only wishes to have attendance of
boys and girls, to prove what he has stated above, but he begs to say that he
wishes parents would deliver their Children into his hands and charge, as he
has already proved in several cases that indulging Children in laziness and
not making them obey their duty have been their ruin—thinking this a
sufficient remark yet without verbosity or any vague assurance—he hopes this
will be conclusive and worthy of the readers attention without embarrassment
of un-accomplished achievements.
"METHOD.—I. A course of intelligent study is initiated & steadily pur-
sued having immediate reference to the requirements of his meanest pupils.
II. The exercises worked by his pupils are carefully corrected and honestly
criticised and every means are taken to secure rapid improvement. III. The
result of six years experience are offered for consideration.
"TERMS.—Learning the letters 2rf. per week; Beginning to read 3rf.
per week; Ditto 'Writing & Arithmetic 4d. per week; Small Hand Writers
ad. per week; Those learning Grammar Gd. per week ; Drawing, Mathematics,
Geography, &c., from 9rf. to 1». 6rf."
Who can say the region enlightened by such an educational lumi-
nary as the author of this hand-bill can be in want of a School-
Board?
SUPPORTERS OF THE CROWN.
A NOTAHLE discovery was communicated to the Times the other
day by MR. HENRY WALK Kit, the Honorary Secretary of the West
London Scientific Association. On the preceding Saturday after-
noon, in the brick earth pit of the old Thames bed at Crayford in
Kent, a gentleman belonging to the learned body abovenamed
found an unquestionable relic of a noble animal too commonly, of
late years, accounted a myth:—
"One of the members of this Association, MR. R. W. CHEADLE, of Christ's
Hospital, was successful in excavating a bone which was identified by PRO-
FESSOR MORRIS as the thighbone of a British species of lion."
Thus the British Lion, whose very name is sneered at by subver-
sive scoffers as all humbug, is now demonstrated to be a genuine
reality, at least to have been a real quadruped once; a live lion in
his day, the most ancient of the good old days,—
"When wild in woods the noble savage ran."
Said "noble savage" being the aboriginal Briton, bedaubed with
woad. That is if in Britain at that prehistoric period there existed
any aborigines on two legs and f eatherless, and if woad was comprised
in the British flura at an epoch when the British fauna included
lions. But, most strange to say, the discovery of the British Lion is
not the only one made by MR. CHEADLE. A more remarkable case of
"curious coincidence" has perhaps never been announced in any
journal than that which remains to be pointed out:—
"MR. CHEADLE found at the same time several teeth of rhinoceros in this
cemetery of ancient life among the hop-gardens of Kent."
It is indeed wonderful that the remains of a creature associated
in heraldry with the British Lion should have been discovered near
those of its companion on the Royal Arms, and that the same
fortunate explorer should have had the honour of discovering not
onlyithe Lion of our British escutcheon, but.the Unicorn as well.

OUR Transatlantic cousins trying
To meet the last cry from the Gallery,
Go in an honest head for buying
At half the present scale of salary.
Almighty Dollar's slaves essay-—
The notion strikes us here as comic—
To halve their President's poor pay,
And so prove clean hands economic.
Alas! there will be no more fun—
Hops. Germans, champagne lunches, dinners—
At the White House in Washington
For hungry saints or thirsty sinners.
Your public life alas! breeds dirt;
Your public organs throw it gaily;
And now the Presidential shirt
Will hardly pay for washing daily.
What it five thousand pounds a year?
'Tis just an English Bishop's income.
While, in the President's starved ear.
The dollars melt from hands that clink 'em!

And English Dukes with envy wince

Emperors and Kings are much too dear;
A President may well come cheaper:
But why give anything a year
To your exalted office-keeper?
Put up the place to auction, friends,
Choose who bids highest—when you 've made him,
Wait till his term of office ends.
And, guess, you '11 find, somehow, it's paid him.
A Fruitless Visit.
MRS. MALAPROP? has suffered a great disappointment.
Hearing of "the fall in the price of silver," she thought
it was a favourable opportunity to buy what she had

expectations of a great bargain were rudely dashed to
the ground when she reached the silversmith's shop.
AN OXFORD MIXTURE.
TTTE following letters have been received at 85, Fleet'Street, during
the past week, on the subject of the Oxford University Bill, now be-
fore the House of Lords. In these days, when public opinion is so
powerful, all useful hints should be of service to Commissioners,
hoth of the present and the future. This being the case, Mr.
Punch has no hesitation in publishing the communications of his
correspondents for that unknown quantity—what they are worth:—
(LETTER I. Postmark, "London, W.")
DEAREST MR. PUNCH,
You have always been the best friend of the Ladies—always
—and I do so want you to help us now. You are so good and so
clever and so amiable that I am sure yon will if you can, and you
know—you satirical, nice important creature—you know you can do
anything if you please. A single line in your truly amusing paper
will have (as Papa calls it) "the desired effect." You know it will,
now don't you?
After reading the first column of the Times the other morning, I
turned to the other pages (as I always do, to see if there is any news
of the dear Prince), and, quite by accident, I came upon a long ac-
count of a meeting of a Convocation at Oxford, headed " LORD SALIS-
BURY'S Bill." As my brother JOHN is at Oxford, of course I devoured
the article with the most awful relish. I couldn't quite understand
it, but Papa tells me that it is proposed to alter the way of spending
the money belonging to the Colleges—the endowments or something
—you know what I mean. I hope you won't consider me a eery silly
goose if I suggest something en passant. I suppose the old Gentle-
men have been too extravagant in their tailor's bills—I know at
Commemoration some of the gowns were quite too gorgeous! Now
for my suggestion.
Don't you remember there was a great fuss a short time ago about
the expenses of Commemoration. I recollect a lot of letters in the
papers saying that the young men could not really afford (poor
fellows) to entertain their sisters and cousins in proper style. One
wretch wanted Commemoration to be abolished! Now this would
be simply too awfully miserable; it would be really wicked! Com-
memoration is too nice, it is indeed.
Why shouldn't some of the funds, dearest Mr. Punch, be devoted
to paying for the Balls, Pic-nios, Garden Parties, and Flower Shows :•
If the Heads of Colleges (is that the right name for them'() objected,
they might be wheedled into saying ''Yes," by receiving a lot of
cards of invitation to everything—of course on condition that they
only asked nice young .Men and unmarried Ladies at least over
forty.
Do, do get this done ior us, dearest Mr. Punch, and merit the
eternal gratitude of yours most sincerely,
A LITTLE GIRL.
P.S.—I must introduce you to JACK. I am sure he would be
delighted to put you up for the week, and his breakfasts are really
quite too lovely.
(LETTER II. Postmark, " City Road.")
MR. PUNCH,
SLR,—I am not a Member of Oxford College, but I have
written ten five-act pieces that a jealous clique of theatrical Mana-
gers (in London and the provinces) have kept off the boards once
trod by that far-famed gentleman sometimes called the famous
"Swan of Avon."
Sir, "if there is any justice in the land of the brave and the free;
if there is still a sun keeping watch over the busy world by dajr as
the silvery moon does by night, like a hawk searching for his first
meal—the early worm of daybreak " (pardon me for quoting from my
own works), let some of the bloated funds of the luxurious College
of Oxford be expended in assisting
Your obedient Servant,
A GENIUS NOT YET RECOGNISED.

SIR,—After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion
that an Oxford education is scarcely the sort of thing to suit a man

intending to enter the Army. My present duties are confined to
company drill, the internal economy of a regiment (inspecting raw
meat and tasting weak tea), and occasionally assisting at the deli-
berations of our Mess Committee.
Why should not some of the University Funds be devoted to
purchasing parade-grounds and the endowment of a Chair of Mili-
tary Science? 1 may say the exercises would he of local as well as
of general importance. As a soldier it is my opinion that even the
Heads of Colleges would be benefited by a course of "setting-up
drill," and as for "the coaches" a month of "par-buckling " and a
fortnight of " trench digging " would do them all the good in the
world—it would make men of them, Sir.
For the sake of the Service you will be glad to hear that what I
learned at Oxford I completely forgot at Sandhurst.

B. A. (Ojrford), Lieutenant —th Foot.
(LETTER IV. Postmark, " Putney.")
MR. EDITOR,
FAR be it from me to suggest that a good oar must
necessarily be a bad scholar (on the contrary, many of our best
Blues have been the prides of their respective Colleges); but surely
field and water sports might now take rank with cramming.
The London Public, Sir, fully appreciate the Oxford and Cam-
bridge Boat Raoe, and the University Cricket Match; but those two
great contests have never been properly recognised on the banks o;
the Cam and the Isis. I see a good opportunity for some repara-
tion in the proposed redistribution of the Oxford funds. Two
chairs (one for Cricket, the other for Boating) might be advan-
tageously established; and perhaps a small fund miglit be reserved
for the entertainment of ex-Lord Mayors by victorious Eights,.or
conquering Elevens.
Let this be done, and I say that Athletic Oxford will be more
than satisfied.
(LETTER V.
MR. EDITOR,
Yours most truly,
AN OLD BLUE.
Postmark, "Little Peddlington.")
SIR,—You will see by my signature that I am the celebrated
Tragedian. Sir, in that character I have a right to be heard.
Sir, what do our young men know about elocution? Nothing—
I absolutely nothing. Don't talk to me, Sir, about a Public Orator.
Pshaw, Sir!—his office is a sinecure, a farce, a sham! Sir, I hear
that Oxford proposes to spend her money after a new fashion. By
all means let her do so.
I am given to understand, Sir, that the University boasts a
Theatre of its own (I have my own doubts upon the subject, Sir;
for I cannot find it mentioned in the Era: but no matter). Then
let that Theatre (if it exists) be worthily filled.
Sir—mark me well—let the University make it worth my while,
and I will allow our youth to see me nightly in a round of my most
famous Shakspearian parts.
As you know, Sir, I am the Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo, Apnthecuri/

three consecutive nights), Othello and Falstaff of the epoch. Need

DOUBTLESS there will be many excellent suggestions made
for the redistribution of the Funds of Oxford University. Accord-
ingly, I am a little shy of advancing the claims of the class to which
I myself belong, and yet if something could be done for us, it would
indeed be a blessing. Indirectly, many an Oxford man working

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
OOD joke (Lords,
Monday, March
mh) of LORD
STANLEY of AL-
DERLEY'S — Will
Government issue
a Fugitive-Coolie
Circular— the
Fugitive Slave
Circular having
proved such a
success? LORD
DERBY, with per-
fect seriousness,
disclaimed any
such intention.
( Commons).—
In Committee on
Royal Titles Bill,
MR. DISRAELI
tried to take the
sting out of the
Bill by explain-
ing that the
QUEEN would,
under no circum-
stances, assume
in fact, is to be
the style of Empress in England. VICTORIA
Empress, "Limited "—to India—and her children, further West, are
still .to be Royal—not Royal and Imperial—Highnesses. LORD
HARTINGTON was sorry this re-assuring pledge had not been given
before Second Reading of the Bill. Still he foresaw awkward com-
plications. Think of the difficulty of keeping the Snoboeracy—Social
and Municipal—to the old title. There would be something so
irresistibly tempting to JENKINS in a new and lower form of Kotow!
SERJBANT SLMON wanted to include a reference to the Colonies in
the Royal Style. Our Warwick—Empress-maker as he is—really
didn't just now sec how that was to be managed, but did not despair
that some day a happy device might be hit upon!
Now it has come to tinkering the Royal Title, Punch can't for the
life of him see the difficulty of turning out a serviceable and com-
prehensive article. What is the objection to " VICTORIA by the Grace
of GOD, of Great Britain, Ireland, India, and the British Colonies
and Dependencies, Uueen '(" Or—better still, because briefer,—why
not, " VICTORIA of the British Dominions Queen?" Mr. P. will be
happy to meet the RIGHT HON. B. D., the RIGHT HON. W. E. G., the
RIGHT HON. SIB, S. N. BART, and the RIGHT HON. LOUD HARTINGTON.
ind will back himself to help those four lame dogs over the Royal
Stylo in the course of an hour's confab, with the aid of a sedative
cigar.
After some boggling, and with many wry faces from the Opposi-
tion, and no great appearance of relist on the .part of the Majority,
the Bill was got through Committee without a division.
Then the House, having shaken off its nomenclative nightmare,
went joyously into Committee of Supply, and knocked off a good
batch of "excess votes " in Army ana Navy Estimates.
Tuesday (Lords).—LORD SALISBURY has ventured—RYLANDS not-
withstanding—to make the post of Indian Councillor tenable
during good behaviour. Their Lordships are to have the comments
)f the Hebdomadal Council and Convocation on the Oxford Bill,
Before going into Committee. That is only fair.
(Commons).—Thank you, MR. RITCHIE, for a very nseful exposi'
)f the constitution, efficiency, expense, and pay of the Metropolitan
Fire Brigade, in support of demand for a Select Committee. Would
;hat all Committees asked and granted had as good a ground laid for
;hem or the chance of being as useful.
SHAW the Life Guardsman used to be a popular hero in the days
when the Buttle of Waterloo came off annually at Astley's. Our
SHAW—the Life and Property Guardsman—has a more solid claim
on London's recognition, for he does a large work with small means,
ind spends himself and his men freely for very inadequate reward.
'.f all our big Babylon's municipal services were as well adminis-
cred, manned and worked as her Fire Brigade, we should have
'ess need for reform of our Local Government.
DR. CAMERON—with Scotch shrewdness and Highland pluck—
wought forward the grievances of the Talisman's crew; the men,
mprisoned without trial, for more than a year, in a filthy dungeon
at Callao, then released without compensation, after being forced to
serve the Peruvian Government for a cruise aboard their own ship:
;he officers still untried prisoners after fifteen months' suffering,
and one of them murderea en attendant by one of the native ruffians
shut up in the same foul hole.
MR. BOURKE told at great length the story of the Talisman—seized

fairly enough by the Peruvian Government as having been chartered and loaded
here by agents of conspirators against the Government, and used for the pur-
poses of a rebellion in the country—but shirked DR. CAMERON'S point, which
was that our Government had been slack in acting on behalf of the crew. "We
are glad to hear from ME. BOURSE that LORD DERBY has, at last, sent out a
peremptory demand for the immediate trial or release of the officers. Better
late than never. Unfortunately, the demand comes too late for the mate,
SIBLEY. The ruffian's knife has already picked the dungeon-lock for him,
poor fellow!
LOBD DERBY should be made to feel that there are occasions on which it is
the duty of a Foreign Secretary's blood to boil. Peru may be as weak among
powers, as she is lawless in her prisons, and rascally in her finance. But that
is no reason why she should be allowed to imprison and ill use English sailors
with impunity. Weakness has its privileges; but this is pushing them too far.
Let us hope that DR. CAMERON'S creditably cool and clear exposition of the case
will from this time secure his clients against the cooling influences of Foreign
Office snow-broth. Even MR. GLADSTONE admitted that LORD DERBY might
have shown more spirit, without infringing his over-cherished rule of discretion.
(Wednesday.}—An Irish afternoon as usual. DR. WASH busy proving that
the Irish Fisheries had been knocked on the head by the treacherous jealousy
of the Saxon, and starved, when the Scotch Fisheries were fed fat on grants and
bounties. He only asks for an Irish Board of Commissioners, like the Scotch—
a branding system, like the Scotch—and a modest annual grant of £20,000, to
be spent in the repairs of piers and harbours, and loans to fishermen, &c. &c.
Da, WAKD, backed by MR. Burr. LOBD HAMILTON, and MR. BRTTEN, and a
strong muster of Irish Members, made out a good case, in the teeth of BAXTER
and the Economists; and SIR M. H. BEACH was driven to the candid admission
that so long as the Scotch system was maintained, if it could be shown that the
Irish Fisheries suffered for want of it, it ought to be extended to them. He
Promised inquiry. As to the grant, there were various loans out of the Repro-
uctive Loan Fund under the Act of 1874. Let us see how the repayments
under that came in, and then it would be time to talk about an extension of the
system. Sly SIB MICHAEL! On the whole, he must oppose the Bill. So it was
negatived by 215 to 131. But DB. WARD can't say he has taken nothing by his
motion.
Thursday (Lords).—LORD SALISBURY promised the
Cambridge University Bill after Easter. Why are the
Dark Blues to have precedence?
(Commons).—" Que diable allait-il faire dans cette
Galfre?" A startler for Egyptian Bulls. When DIS-
RAELI promised CAVE'S Report he had not read it.
Having read it he thought KHEDIVE mightn't like it.
KHEDIVE being asked, said he didn't like it, and the
voice of the CAVE is not to be heard in the City. 80 the
Report is burked, and the Bears are loose with a ven-
geance! DISRAELI may boast to have repeated the feat
of his forefathers. He has spoiled the Egyptians!
MiLTOlf's hymn conies to mind—with a difference:—
The Oracle IB dnmb!
From forth the Cave no hum
Skaketli the market, up or downward heaving.
The KHEDIVE doth opine
That light might raise a shine.
So Cabinet seals CAVE—Egyptian darkness leaving!
Another contribution—perhaps the largest of the year,
and they have been both large and many—to BENJAMIN'S
mess.
But he crowned even this to-night, by his amazing
speech on the Royal Titles Bill—in which he ran play-
fully down a whole gamut of "authorities," from
SPENCER'S Fairy Queen and CAMDEN'S Britannia to
ir/iitaki-r's Almanac, and the letter of a nursery cor-
respondent—a dear good girl of twelve—who finds the
QUEEN called Empress in her school-geography, a work
with the high authority of an eighty-ninth edition.
But the Sphinx's most mysterious riddle was left for
the last. Have not the bazaars and the ryots heard of
an '' Emperor "—an irresistible conqueror—who is slowly,
but surely, absorbing Asia, from the North downwards?
Henceforth India shall have her "Empress " to throw
in the "Emperor's" teeth!
Marvellous medicine of a word! Mighty mystery of
the Asian mind! Soundless depths of the Disraehtish
incomprehensible!
Here be reasons, 0 BULL! plentiful as black-berries,
and big as it is easy to make wind-bags. So Third
Reading of the Bill was carried by 209 to 134, under
protest of the Opposition, well and weightily uttered
by the accredited mouths of GLADSTONE and LOWE; and
with the freshness and force of a new voice, besides—
that of COWEN, a dark diamond from coaly Tyne. So
passes the Bill to the Lords. Q. b. f.f. que siet, prays
Punch, but doubtingly, for he loves not to see high
things lightly handled—and is for holding to the old
ways nowhere so reverently as in the region round the
Throne.
On Merchant Shipping Bill. There is a chance of
getting the pressure of Poor JACK'S collar lightened
in one place. MR. GOBST enforced from recalcitrant
ADDERLEY promise of a Clause to confine imprisonment
for breach of sailor's contract to cases involving danger
to life or ship.
Friday.—Nothing so remarkable as SEHJEANT SHER-
LOCK'S gallant proposal to uncage the Ladies! Many
Members—HOPE and MANNERS included—maintained
that the Ladies preferred their present den " behind the
grille, behind the grille !"—to parody the Laureate.
Stone walls do not a prison make,
Nor brazen bars a cage;
Ladies, the House who visit, take
These for a privilege!
NOTE ON NAVAL ESTIMATES.
ONE Gnn that will sink an Iron-clad is as good as a
broadside. A gunboat, whilst hitting hard enough to
sink a Minotaur, is hard for the Minotaur to hit. The
smaller the vessel and fewer her crew, the smaller and
cheaper the calamity of her going to the bottom. A Little
Ship with a Great Gun might do wonders. We want a
lot of those Little Ships, my Lords.

DRAWING-ROOM DRESSES.
You DEAR
CREATURE,
I KNOW you
receive letters
from Ladies
sometimes —very
often, perhaps,—
but, anyhow, you
published a week
or two ago one
from an awfully
jolly girl, I
should think
(though I really
forget what it
was about). But
what I want to
say is apropos of
these Drawing-
Rooms HEB
MAJESTY (I sup-
pose I ought to
say Her Imperial
Majesty f) has
announced— that
is, of course it is
the LORD CHAM-
UKKJ.A1N, not
the QUEEN, who announces them — for May next. * .
I am'sure no girl in the United Kingdom, India, or the Colonies,
can bej more loyal than I am, but why on earth we should be
victimised and forced to go in evening dresses to a morning perform-
ance goodness gracious only knows. I have been to more than one
Drawing-Room, and I know the delights of running out, even in
May mornings, into one's carriage in low body and a train; sitting
to be stared at by any casual passer-by in St. James's Street—and,
whether it be LORD OGLEBY or the crossing-sweeper who looks into
the carriage window, I know my shoulders in broad daylight must
look frightfully yellow, however much poudre de r>z I put on before
starting, and even supposing them couleur de rose or "cherub-
tinted, one feels so undressed in the day-time that it really seems
quite too awfully shocking, especially as a girl does not take a fan
to a Drawing-Room. Why are these fetes not held at night? Or,
if they must be by day, why cannot Ladies be received in a special
morning dress, which, WORTH knows, may be quite as expensive and
much more becoming, with those loves of Sebe bonnets which are
just coming in from Paris. Trains, of course, would be discarded,
though no doubt the skirts would be quite as long. But what
anxiety, what nerves, what hysterics would be avoided if such a
consummation could be arrived at!
Surely feathers, trains, and all the rest of it should be as obsolete
as cavauer boots and powder, or, at any rate, as tail uniforms and
epaulettes. Some Mammas (don't print this), whoso daughters
possess exceptionally good shoulders, might object, you know, but
oh! what a blessing it would be to most of us, who now catch frightful
colds, and in some oases consumption, merely to give the Gentlemen-
at-Arms an opportunity of studying iesthetical anatomy while we
are shivering in the Ante-Room.
I am quite serious, so do be so for once, and help

A NEW NOVEL. BY MISS HHODY DENDHON,
Authoress of " Cometh Down like a Shower," "Bed in the Nose is She,"
"Good! Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, £ut don't Tell."
CHAPTER II.— What the Author says.
"WHILE our erring, wayward, wild, innocent BELLA, despising the
shackles of conventionality, is disguising herself in the REVEREND
TOMMY HASSOCK'S clerical costume, and making that soft, dumpling-
headed clergyman turn quite pink with exasperation at being locked
into the jam-cupboard during the process of masquerading which is
going on in our front apartment,—JENNY takes a good long look at
the innocent cause of all this excitement, who is standing in front
of the one hotel at Wollum. He is engaged in swallowing a basin
of soup, while, with bis eyes, he is devouring the bill of fare which
the waiter is holding up for his inspection. Not a very romantic
situation for a hero, truly; yet BELLA,—pausing to settle her white
tie, and adjust the REVEREND TOMMY'S pale green spectacles to her
great unusual-looking eyes, which shine brightly under their white
Eds,—catching the movement of his deep, poppy-hued lips,—half
hidden under a Niagara of tawny hair,—as they pronounced the
words, "Heal Turtle," felt, that, within her soul, there was suddenly
revealed to her a bottomless depth—a wild, mad, reckless fervour
of .passion, to which all her past girlish pleasure in ices, jam-tarts,
rolls, and cauliflowers, were but as a drop of summer dew to the
tempestuous upheavings of old ocean's stormy bosom. She had seen
his lips move; she had caught the masterful words, "Real Turtle!"
Ana what sort of man was he, who, this day, had been so freely
inspired with tho secret word, the talisman, the key to this priceless
treasure of new-born uncalculating passion? This is he:—A big,
powerful figure, deep-chested, clean-limbed, thin-flanked. Arms
long and sinewy, with muscle rising in knotted cords upon them.
His head,—towering stately over the heads of other men, being, as
anatomists technically express it, " screwed on the right way, —
was so firmly set on his long, massive, columnar neck, as—his rich
tawny, deep-brown hair, being cut short, and brushed straight up,
artichoke fashion—to find a perfect resemblance in the sun-lit pine-
apple that crowns the summit of Old London's fiery Monument.
He has harsh, swart features,—swarter than most swart features,
—and a great, soft, black-brown moustache, silkier than the silkiest
floss, drooping over his ample, gleaming:, mouth. Penthouse brows,
and dwelling under them, in their shadow, luminous dark eyes that
loved to feast royally on Nature's bounteous gifts to women, with
long, unshackled looks. A magnificent ugly man. Such was CAP-
TAIN IVAR DUSOVER BELJAMBE.
So much for his outside. For his inside, it requires a more inti-
mate acquaintance with the menu he is considering than we as yet
possess, ere we can weigh and measure this momentous question, and
pronounce according to any fixed constitutional standard. He was
not more conceited, more dissipated, more self-indulgent, or secret-
lier fonder of nuts, preserved fruits, and sweet things at dessert after
the ladies have gone, than most men are. His voice was soft, and
low as the tone of a muffled fog-horn sounding o'er the summer sea
through the mists of evening-tide. Dreadfully soft could that voice
be when it chose, suiting itself to the quality or the willing listener.
An ostler is waiting with a dog-cart for CAPTAIN BELJAMBK.
Seeing this, he finishes his soup, and stretching out lazily one of his
long, big, strong, shapely legs, he gave free play to his muscles, and
with an abrupt intimation of his iron, inflexible, foot, dismisses the
waiter, who, borne upward, and onward, by the giant impulse, floats
away to where the sun is already sloping westwards, and disappear-
ing in the first sprinkling on the water of the holy moonshine, is, so,
gradually lost to view.
During the above, BELLA has finished her toilette, has turned to
her sister, and asked,
"There, JENNY, am I a waiter? Am I a waiter or a clergyman?
Am I to say ' My Christian friends,' or 'C'mingsir, yessir, d'reckly-
r —which is it to be P"
"Good Heavens!" exclaims JENNY. But before she has time for
more, BELLA has shut the door briskly, and has rushed down-stairs
into the street.
CAPTAIN IVAR DirsovER BELJAMBE has already taken his seat in
his dog-cart, is giving the last smoothing caress to his lion-coloured
moustache, before taking the reins in the firm-enclosing, unrelenting
strong, iron, grasp of the long, clean, well-shaped muscular fingers of
his sinuous right hand. His left, ungloved, still retains the soup-
plate, which, in momentary forgetfulness of the waiter's enforced
departure, he is holding out, expecting it be taken by the'attendant.
And so it is. White, plump, round, soft, ready little (fingers seize
it, as a tremulous voice, from a pleading face, upward turned to-
wards his hairy countenance and herculean shoulders, says
"Sherry, Sir? Yessir (Trocklysir."
Happv DCSOVER! Lucky Moslem in the dog-cart, to have'his
sherbet brought to him by such a houri.'
It was a pretty sight: the big, gentlemanlike-looking man in
light clothes, bending down towards the beautiful girl masquerading
in the REVEREND MB. HASSOCK'S clerical attire—
"Half light, half shade,
A silent waiter, or a gleeful maid?"
Her white tie, tumbled and creased in her endeavours to make both
ends meet, seemed but a poor muddy yellow strip, as it lovingly
encircled her soft, white, warm throat. Her high, black, waistcoat
sat well on her bold, well-denned fairy bust, and the sun kissed her
hair and her hands, as though he were some rod-loving schoolmaster
who could never be sated with, tanning her. Her cheeks, rosier
than rosy red, are glowing hotlier and notlier with the unwonted
excitement, and her eyes sparkle and glitter like beautiful great
sapphires.
The grey mare is growing restive.
"Come up!" says the deep tone of DUSOVER BELJAMBE'S bell-
like voice; so deep, so bell-like, that, at its sound, the good people

of Wollum took up their prayer-books, and were ioi trudging off to
church; while some few of the smaller tradesmen came out to put
up their shutters, under the impression that the knell of the Lord oi
the Manor, or at least of the old Squire, was being rung.
"Come up, will you?" he says once more to the restive mare.
BELLA VILLABS hears, looks up at him hardily, growing crimson,
but with a dare-devil light in her eyes, and repeats,
"' Come up, will you?' I will.''
"I don't care about mixed society," returns CAPTAIN BELJAMBE,
rudely: "and you seem to be neither one thing nor the other."
"It I am not allowed to do what I like, I scream," answered the
girl, gravely. "I am coming for a drive with you, and intend to
upset your cart. Do you give me carte blanche f
"This is my carte de vmte," replied CAPTAIN Dr/sovER BELJAMBE,
carelessly, "and I am going to make a round of calls."
"So am I!" cries BELLA. "TOMMY, make room for your uncle!"
she adds, as, at one bold jump, she springs up lightly into the
vehicle, and seats herself by bis side, not more than three inches
distant from his great shoulder.
"Now then! Wake up! Oft we go!" she exclaims, as, in a
sudden ecstasy of breathless enjoyment, she reaches over the splash-
board and flogs the mare with poor MB. HASSOCK'S crumpled hat.
CAPTAIN DUSOVEB looks at her full womanly figure, at the round
white throat, like a column of Devonshire cream, and then, with one
short stirring cry, and a sharp click of the whip, he gives his mare
the reins, and away thev are carried at the rate of thirty miles an
hour, while her sister JENNY from the balcony is shouting out,
"Come back! Come back!" and the REVEREND MR. HASSOCK, pink
with vexation, and dressed in BELLA'S cast-off gown, which the
emergency has compelled him to adopt, is waving his blue umbrella
from an upper window.
"She is a dear good girl," he is saying to himself, "and really
fond of parish work."
He waves his umbrella once more, and for the last time—BELLA is
out of hearing, out of seeing, now: she is galloping down the shady
green lanes by the sea, looking up into the searching flame of
DUSOVER BELJAMBE'S gaze, sipping draughts of poison, thinking to
herself "All this is very wrong, highly improper, but what of that?
It is utterly unimagined bliss I
So they sped on, swiftly, these two, down the still road.

forth the difficulty he and thousands of others, occasional visitors

night, owing to the multitude of streets with no names visible at
all, and even in the principal thoroughfares none to be seen for half
a mile. You need not be told how to remedy this state of things in

as not to require being enlightened by J. E. S." as follows :—
"What I wish to propose, or rather suggest, is this: that the names of the
streets be put on the lamp-glasses, as you now see at many of the Railway
Stations. The cost would be trifling, and the boon immense."
A clever idea, isn't it? and one which, if realised, would be a

MORAL SUASION FOR SOTS.
(An Appeal to the United Kingdom Alliance.)
WHY cry for vexatious laws to curtail the freedom of the Briton,
destroy the Liquor-merchant's livelihood, rob the poor man of his
beer, and in consistency the rich man of his burgundv, when you
could make people sober without any restrictive Act of Parliament?
The way thereto has long been an open secret for any one with eyes
in his (mind's) head. Now every fool who runs may read it in a
paper just issued by the Howard Association on the "Means of
Diminishing Intemperance."
For this purpose, instead of trying to go the whole hog like tee-
total fanatics, the Howard Association proposes to proceed on old
"HESIOD'S maxim that " the half is more than the whole;" to do
as much as will suffice, and not to fail by over-doing. Having sug-
gested certain modifications of the present licensing system, they
observe, for the instruction of Good Templars and Permissive Pro-
hibitory Allies:—
"But when all has been done that intelligent public opinion is ever
likely to sanction in the way of legal restrictions and licensing conditions, the
principal work will still be to influence the personal convictions and habits of
the people themselves as voluntary agents. And this can only be effected, us
hitherto, by MORAL AND RELIGIOUS OPERATIONS cencurrently (it is im-
portant to remark) with an increase of such necessary facilities of sobriety, as
HEALTHY DWELLINGS, PROVIDENT HABITS, INNOCENT RECREATIONS,
WORKMEN'S CLUBS, EDUCATIONAL ELEVATION, and a cheap and ever-rcadj-
supply of HARMLESS BEVERAGES."
Why, is not all this the revelation of a secret which everybody
must now see to be as plain as the nose on his face—how plain
soever? Who are the sober classes pray, 6iK WILFRID LAWSON!'
Just exactly those who enjoy the abovenamed advantages, all,
except Workmen's Clubs, because you Swells have Clubs of your own
—the Carlton, Reform, Conservative, and such. You are the sober
classes, you, the superior classes—not always classes as sober as they
were superior. You, the comfortable and luxurious classes, blessed
especially with healthy homes, and with a cheap and ever-ready
supply of harmless beverages—champagne, claret, and numerous
other wholesome wines; beverages dog-cheap to you who can well
afford them, and not only harmless but beneficial to you who know
better than to abuse them, and have no temptation. When the
superior classes drank port and sherry and brandy-and-water, a sot,
drunk and incapable, used to be proverbiallv said to be "as drunk
as a lord." Do you ever see a nobleman in tfie gutter now? With
good hot coffee, as sold in the streets of Birmingham at a halfpenny
per cup (and a profit of from 12 to 15 per cent.), good ginger-beer
no dearer than bad ale, try if you cannot wean the drunken classes
from intoxicating liquors, as their betters—BO called—were weaned
on light wines before them. Legislate for the drainage and ventila-
tion of those dwellings, from whose filth and squalor they fly to the
public-house. Give them—the Howard Association particularly
urges—religious training: that is to say, Christianity, not Maho-
metanism. The Turks are patterns of temperance, but of what other
virtue? Suppose, whilst you, the United Kingdom Alliance, go on
agitating for coercive liquor laws, the preventives of Intemperance
recommended bv the Howard Association are effectually tried.
Suppose by-and-by you find drunkenness, your raison d'etre, abo-
lished, vour platform cut from under your legs, and your occupation
gone. How glad, no doubt, you will all of you be; now rejoiced at
beholding national sobriety effected without the enforcement of
unwilling abstinence!

this Commission do much?
* REDESDALE

The Duo OF RICHMOND
promises the DUKE OF
Commission to inquire into
noxious vapours — the
breath of Vested Right in
its most unsavoury forms
—of candle, soap, and
manure manufacturing,
bone - boiling, alkali -
making, copper-smelting.
and so forth—but does not think the Commission should recommend
what legislative measures are required to deal with these rank
offences, which smell to heaven at least as strongly as Claudius's
fratricide. Parliament as well as the public would have reason to
thank the Royal Commission that could suggest any legal remedy
for such nuisances that would work. Otherwise, we hardly see the
good of the inquiry. The nuisances are admitted, and we have
plenty of legal remedies that won't work, already.
LORD CAIBNS doesn't see his way for the present to a Marriage
Bill to harmonise the law of connubial coupling for England, Scot-
land, and Ireland. Store shame for JOHN, SANDY, and PAT, who
are content to leave it a puzzle for legal heads to solve when one
and one make one, and When they make two, by the law of the three
countries.
(Common*.)—SAMUELSON trying to undo the work of BENJAMIN.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER did his best, but to little pur-
pose, to temper the wind to the shorn bulls, by explaining away the
non-publication of CAVE'S Report. It won t do. Everything is
presumed against our unfortunate client, the KHEDIVE. BENJAMIN
has smitten the Egyptians hip and thigh; and Poor ISMAIL brought
to his marrow-bones by a fall of ten ijer cent, in less than ten days,
may well pray, "Save me from my friends!"
The Leader of the Government promises the Leader bf the Oppo-
sition an opening for a set-to, on the vote for the cost of MR. CAVE'S
mission. Somebody ought to catch itt hot and heavy.
In Committee on Merchant Shipping Bill, MR. PLIMSOLL tem-
perately, and therefore powerfully, pleaded for his Amendment
enforcing a survey of all unclassed ships', in preference to the
Government plan of punishing the Owner who sends an tlnseaworthy
ship to sea. The Country's feeling goes with PLIMSOLL; and Punch
is not by any mcalis inclined to boW down to the authority, as pleaded
by MB. SHAW LEFEVRE, of nearly every President of the Board of
Trade and all the permanent officials in favour of penalties and
against the protective operation of survey.
After a long discussion—in which ME. FORSTER'S adherence to
MR. PLIMSOLL is worth noting—the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHE-
QUER threw his weight into the scale against PLIMSOLL, declaring
that the Government, after much balancing of the two plans, had
deliberately preferred punishment to enforced survey, as a preven-
tive of unseaworthiness. The fear is that the State Surveying
Board would finally swallow up all the private surveying bodies
like LLOYD'S, and that this would create a false security, and exone-
rate shipowners from responsibility. So pleads ME. NORWOOD. VTe
don't feel quite disposed to take the word of the wolves on the
efficacy of competing systems of sheep-watching. But the end was
—after a debate, in which Ms. PLTMSOIL trat his case very
effectively, and the Board of Trade (till the CHANCELLOB OF THE
EXCHEQUER came to the President's aid) very weakly—the defeat of
the Amendment by 247 to 110. So be it. Let us see how penalty
works. We may yel fcoine to prevention.
Tuesday (Lards).—The DUKE OF BUCCLEUCH indignantly disclaims
the intention of seconding LOBD SHAFTESBURY when he asks the
Peers respectfully to pray HER MAJESTY not to flaunt Imperial
Purple in her BULL'S face. AVe are only sorry the Duke is not going
to do about the most sensible thing a Conservative Peer could do in
this unlucky business. As Government did not concert with Op-
position before bringing in the Bill, their best course would be so to
concert before passing it. But they won't—the more's the pity.
(Commons.)—Ma. DISRAELI fenced and dodged about a question of
MR. ANDERSON'S as to the precedents for the QUEEN'S going abroad
during the sitting of Parliament. MR. DISRAELI is not happy in
this kind of performance, which is always a dangerous one. Even
so old and skilled a performer as PALMERSTOW damaged himself
seriously at it. The House is glad to laugh at'a smart answer to an
awkward question, but, in the long run, resents being poked
fun at.
Government had the narrowest escape from a very damaging de-
feat on MB. MELDON'S Motion for assimilating the English and Irish
Borough Franchise—in other words, for giving household suffrage in
Irish boroughs.
To be sure, household suffrage in England corresponds to mud-
cabinhold suffrage in Ireland. We should have thought this
a weightier distinction than it appears to JOHW BRIGHT, who
came out quite in his old form, so that the Home-Rulers found
themselves in a minority—would it be more Irish to say a large, or
a small one?—of 166 to 179, and nearly shouted themselves into
hysterics. Punch, from his invisible seat in the gallery, turned his
eyes tenderlv away from the Major, out of respect for his feelings.
The Irish Reform Bill stops the way! Reform Bill coming down!
Wednesday.—An Irish afternoon, in the coolest sense of the word.
MR. Bun, with inimitable assurance, brought forward what he
called a Land Tenure—but which MR. HERBERT of Muckross' more
correctly described as a Land Transfer—Bill for Ireland. The
Honourable and Learned Member for Limerick proposes to deprive
Landlords of the power of Eviction, except for 'non-payment of
rents, to be settlea by the award of a Court of Arbitration. This,
with a variety of other limitations and conditions, would result in
what MR. HERBERT not unfairly described as a transfer of the land
of Ireland to the Tenant-Farmers, reducing the Landlords to
uncertain annuitants on rent-charges, the amount of which would
be very much at their Tenants' mercy.
The House wasted the afternoon on this wonderful specimen of
Home-Rule Legislation, and finally paid it the ill-deserved com-
pliment of an adjournment till Monday. LORD HABTINGTON
was somehow crowded out, or he ought to have stood by SIR
M. H. BEACH in putting, down his foot on this audacious attempt
at confiscation. Irish Landlords may be bad enough—some of them
—but does what we know of Irish Tenants warrant any hope for
Ireland from putting them in their Landlords' shoes? There is
"property " in the serious, and "property" in the theatrical sense.
We may help MR. BUTT'S Irish mob to treat the one as if it were the
other. But the House of Commons should not be the place to let the
distinction be disregarded, even for a Wednesday afternoon.
Thursday (Lords}.—The Royal Titles Bill read a Second Time,
without a division—except of opinion. But that division .found as
full and potent voice as if their Lordships had been voting " Aye"
and "No." The DUKE OF SOMERSET spoke his protest; and when
the straightforwardness of LORD GREY—christen it "crotcheti-
ness" if you please, you can't deny the intelligence and indepen-
dence that are worked into its warp and woof—the plain-spoken
sense of LORD LAWRENCE, the experience of LORD WAVENEY, the
whimsical keenness of LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY, the polished
humour of LORD GRANVILLE, were pitted against the perfunctory
pleading of the DUKE CF RICHMOND and the trenchant audacity of
the MARQUIS OF, SALISBURY, can we Wonder if filigree "Empress"
kicked the beam against weighty " Queen " P
What we do wonder at Is, that the President of the Council and
the Indian Secretary should daro maintain that the dislike to the
title is a figment of faction, and the public meetings and petitions
against it a " got-up " thing! Tour motto, my Lords, your motto
— (see your Punch of last week) — " jtolumut nomeii Regina;
mtitari:" Speak it out—the voice of England is ready to echo you.
(Common*.)—MR. CROSS announced TYLEH'S fiat, closing Ham
mersmith Bridge on the Boat-Race day.
More Merchant Shipping.
Friday (Lords).—A gallant attempt by LORD GBANVILLE to turn
LORD SALISBURY flank. Instead of doing away with the "Idle
Fellowships "—falsely so called—LORD GBANVILLE proposed to open
the Clerical ones! Audacious! But strange to say 40 to 57 went
along with this audacious innovator.
The Unattached Students may thank the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTER-
BURY for empowering the Commissioners to employ surplus funds in
, founding scholarships tenable by these well-deserving waifs—these
diligent dogs who eat of the crumbs from the rich men's tables.

in reading or writing bad poetry or execrable histories and biographies—all
this rubbish to be read by the few, and thrown aside by the many—it is a
gratifying reflection that we are this day met to celebrate the triumphs of
a profession which has not only benefited its members by the riches they
have derived from its pursuit, but has been the means of securing the world
against the most awful calamity that could befall it—after a far advance into
civilisation—a relapse into barbarism."—MK. LOWE to the Engineers.
HIDE, PLATO, thy diminished head, and pass
Into Philosophy s inferior class,
Since but for thee, vile sophist, but for thee,
There had not been the sad catastrophe,
When the barbaric tide was onward hurled,
And Rome no longer ruled a happy world.
Yes, metaphysic prater, but for thee,
Rome would be mistress still, o'er land and sea,
Gallia and Britain, humbly crouching down,
"Would send their tribute to the Imperial town;
And subject provinces would lick the dust
Before our Emperor, peerless and august.
Thus Mn. LOWE, who always greatly dares:
And next, he kicks the literate world down-stairs,
Sneers at the small grammarians, although he
Has lately stooped to grace a Spelling Bee;
Lays heavily his strenuous lingual lash
On poets' rubbish and historians' trash,
Ana fails to see that, if poetic thought
And great historic records go for nought,
If life is sunk to mere material sense,
No State existing would be worth defence.
'Tis very well to praise the Engineers—
A useful army—but they have their peers:
It is the solitary thinker's brain
That gives us lightning-wire and railway-train.
Apollo bids the radiant arrows fly:
Let Vulcan forge the sun-god's panoply.
As to the Roman Rule, it may be sad
That it was crushed by the barbarian cad,
And all through PLATO—sad to think that we
Are Englishmen, and tolerably free,
Instead of working hard at Roman roads,
And bringing to the ds&AB birthday odes.
But in that higher state, we want to know
"What special corner would belong to LOWE.
"Would he not vanish, Orator of whim?
And would there be a Punch to laugh at him P
w
Piping Times.
THIS must be a pleasant and easy-going employer, who advertises
in the West Sussex Gazette:—
ANTED, a CARTER. "\Vill be allowed to do anything he likes
except smoke in the drawing-room. Liberal wages given.—Apply, &o.
Carters seem to inspire facctiousness in advertisers. This is
from a Bolton paper:—

rately sober one would not be objected to.—Inquire, &c.

'TRAIN UP A CHILD IN THE WAY HE SHOULD GO."
Tommy (to Mamma, encouragingly). "Now THEN, MA', HARDEN YOUR HEART, SIT WKLL DOWN, AND NEVER SAY DIE!'
SANITARY SANGRADOISM.
REALLY, the Doctors are determined to frighten us out of our wits.
Every day we are warned to take care of our nerves, not to touch
alcohol, not to walk too far, not to play a game of cricket, or row on
the nver with AMANDA—
Where on the ait all emerald is the osier,
Where the white swan-fleets indolently sway,
When, in the sunset, Beauty, crowing rosier,
Murmurs, " How happy we have been to-day ! "—
not to sit up late o' nights, whether to hear the chimes at midnight
or unsphere the spirit of PLATO; not to do anything which our
strong forefathers did freely, yet lived to a good old age with clear
brains to the last, in spite of gout and insanitary surroundings.
Such Sages as C'LEOBtrurs and PnrACUS were all very well with
their Measure is best "and "Nothing in excess": but nowadays
we are vexed with an immoderate moderation, an intemperate
intemperance. Here is DK. RICHARDSON, who ttlls us that alcohol
produces "Nothing but disease and death—mental disease, mental
death; physical disease, physical death." Silence the profane
rhymer, who sings—
Hear, oh hear!
DIONYSUS and DEMETER—
Give, oh give
Wine and corn, that the Poet may live:
All Olympus I disdain,
Blest with aid of that glorious twain.
And don't for a moment suppose that one drink is worse than
another. "To say this man only drinks ale, that man onlv drinks
wine, while a third drinks spirits, is merely to say, when the
ipology la unclothed, that all drink the same danger." Mr. Punch
has never unclothed an apology; but he holds that there is less
langer in a pint of sound ale or wine than in a much smaller dose of
irandy or whiskey.
The same medical luminary objects to exercise, except of a languid
sort. He thinks the tortoise wiser than the eagle. Perhaps he is,
if length of life is the only desideratum. "Centuries of life in the
aggregate," says a Times Critic, as humorously as if he were writing
for this lighter page, "may have been sacrificed by the single
invention of the staircase." If so, what has the railway to answer
for, shattering every fibre of brain and body through mile's of travel?
Let us all be lotos-eaters. Let us swing in hammocks, and read
feuilletont, and smoke latakia. A pleasant idea, doubtless; but the
world will move, and its inhabitants must move with it. Besides,
what says SIR WALTER ?—
"Sound, sound the clarion, fill the fife!
To all the sensual world proclaim,
One crowded hour of glorious life
Is worth an age without a name"
The heroes eat no lotos. Ulysses and Mr. Punch alike decline
torpidity. The universe wants the mind of man to keep it going.
Fancy the result if everybody were to give up hard work ana mid-
night fun, to stay at home and nurse his nerves, and go to bed
early after a moderate supper of water-gruel! Faith, it would be
high time for the Ladies to take the reins—and they would do it too,
and make the "mildeyed melancholy lotos-eaters" break into a
sharp trot.
There are doctors of nerves, whom it pleases
To write about modern diseases •
Who believes in their books
Will feel " off the hooks"
If he suddenly shivers or sneezes.
Appalling the tiniest swerve is
To any who knows not what nerve is —
But the string of the bow
Whence brain-arrows flow,
Oft must tremble to do the State service.
0 reader, who wisdom diecernest,
Take life at its gayest or sternest:
Tho doctors may prate,
They are welcome to wait.
Eat aiul dnuk, work and pluy, in good earnest.

TEMPERANCE TAVERNS.
ur of the columns of a
contemporary Mr. Punch
transcribes with high de-
light an interesting para-
graph respecting—
"PUBLIC - HOUSES FOB
WOUKING MEN.—We have
been requested to draw utten-
tion to an effort to establish
another' Public-house,' with-
out the drink, in the East End
of London. The success al-
ready attending the movement
has induced the REV. Gr. P.
KEOOH, Vicnr of St. Paul's,
Stratford, to start another in
that populous neighbourhood.
The district contains some ten
thousand inhabitants, chiefly
working men. llu. KEOOH
has raised one hundred pounds
but wants the balance of one
thousand pounds to enable him
to complete the good work."
"Without the drink,'
at a public-house of the
kind above - mentioned,
means, not the negation
of any drink at all, but
only the absence of those particular beverages which, in excess, occa-
sion inarticulate utterance, bad language, metaphysical argument,
devious gait, prostration and incapability, or disorderly conduct,
violent assaults inflicted on pot-companions, passers-by, or police-
men, and the commission of furious outrages, such as savage beating
or kicking upon wives. Of course, public-houses for working mei
supply them with the means of purely quenching their thirst, and
are furnished with bars if not taps; but the bars, and the taps H
there be any, are temperance taps and bars. From the foregoing
statement it appears that the movement" of co-operation in
establishing such public-houses is a success. It is therefore one ii
which the benevolent may invest money with the reasonable hope oi
high returns, not to say dividends, in the shape of the improvemenl
and welfare of their "kind. Certain Teetotal Societies are in the
receipt of subscriptions for which, perhaps, though there are many
tracts and much talk to show, there is little temperance. The
quantity of this at present inadequate result would be greatly
increased if they would rather expend enough of their income on
the institution of these public-houses to promote sobriety; and ii
particular contribute a sufficiency to make up the balance requirec
by the REV. ME. KEOOH for the completion of the truly good work
to which he has devoted himself in Oriental London. Success t
that-Reverend philanthropist's endeavours to provide carpenters
bricklayers, plumbers-and-glaziers, and other workmen, with house
of call which are not pot-nouses; public-houses without barrel or
bung.
GONE WRONG!
A NEW NOVEL. BY MI88 RHODY DENDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh Dawn like a Shower," "Red in the Nose w She,'
"Good! Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, Sut don't Tell."
CHAPTER III.— What Jenny says.
"Goon Heavens!" I exclaim. This is my favourite ejaculation
and being recognised only as " BELLA'S Elder Sister," it is as gooc
as any other, nobody seeming to pay any attention to my observa
tions, which are invariably distinguished by excellent common sense
We—that is the REVEREND MB. THOMAS HASSOCK and myself—
are tramping across the fields within view of the Wollum high road
and the grey, monotonous, motionless sea-shore. I am carryin
BELLA'S dress, which she has left behind her in our room, and poor
hapless, hopctul TOMMY is holding his green umbrella over my heac
with one hand, while with the other he is disconsolately playin
"The Glorious Flag of Old England.'" on the concertina. In thi
world one must love something—even though it be a donkey "avers
to speed "—and yet I neither love, nor am beloved. I have set u
no idol, to be adored with frenzy and knife-gashings. No; I do no
get ley md homely intercourse with a "friend," and a friend is
sexless thing, I shall never have a lover: I had better become a
once a member of the " Society of Friends," where, perhaps, I sha
meet with nothing more grand, manly, or fondly devoted!, as far a
I am concerned, than is, at this present moment, the REVEREN
THOMAS, who is secretly worshipping his Ideal, while his little pin
yes are peering through his blue spectacles, and a small pocket
.elescope of unusual power, into the mist beneath the dull yellow
moonlight. Then he hands me the telescope, and by its aid I see
—hat makes me exclaim, for the second time, "Good Heavens!"
BELLA is seated in the trap close to DPSOVER BELJAMBE'S great,
road shoulder. Her small head is bent down towards the jrrey
mare's tail, which is heavily laden with great twists of crisp, silky,
urzy hair tied with a blue bow; and, as the restless wavering
moonbeams fall under BELLA'S soft hat, and light up the deep
merald eyes of that small downy face, he could not fail to notice
low downy this beautiful creature looked,—
"Bo downy she,
As none like her could snare the winged songster,
With bait saline upon its hindmost feather:
So downy she—that, not in all creation,
Gould aught, except a hammer, be proclaimed
Her peer in downiness."
TOMMY'S telescope brings them so near to us that we are able to
:atoh their words.
"I hated my father," says BELLA presently, dangling her white,
)lump hand over the wheel, and playing with the mud, as it spirts
ip inlittle silver jets over the folds oi her long dark robe—whereat
\£R. HASSOCK groans audibly—for it ia kit clerical coat that my way-
vard sister is still wearing.
"And your mother?" asks DUSOVER, bending his head so as to
tare right under her hat into h,er grand opal eyes.
BELLA drew up her long white throat, and tossed her head in the
lir. CAPTAIN Bi:i,.iA 11 in: eyed this feat with curiosity, but with no
apparent admiration. It occurred to him that a girl, who could do
so much, might throw herself away. In all his past experience of
women, this one was something new, relishing, appetising to his
laded palate.
Then BELLA folded her round, plump, dimpled hands in her lap,
and put them carefully away in her pocket, while delicious ripples
of laughter played about ner rosebud lips and warm southern
cheeks, on which still remained the blush-dye of the fiery sun-god's
dss.*
"My mother," answers BELLA, "was a good, dowdy old soul,
always in tears and revoking at whist." And BELLA disdainfully
;hrusts out her red under-lip, and looks up into DUSOVER'S hirsute
countenance with contemptuous pink face, as she recites,—
"' Who was it slapped me when I fell,
Who whipt, and bade me not to tell,
Who kicked the place to make it swell?
My Mother!"'
"Shall I sing to you?" she asks, suddenly.
CAPTAIN DUSOVER, who is leaning his arms on the splash-board,
and craning his sinewy brown neck out beyond the grey mare's
blinkers, to ascertain the clearness of the coast towards the direction
in which they are rapidly going, replies, carelessly,
"If you can sing, chantez.'
"Chante*.'" she repeats, drily: then'adds, pettishly, " Shanjt-y."
"Do you mean that for a pun P"
"If you like."
"I don't care."
"No more do I."
"Sing!"
"Shall IP In this dress?"
She points down at the long clerical skirt which is wafted against
his knees. TOMMY HASSOCK, seeing this from afar off, sinks on his
knees, while tears well up into his little pink eyes, and suffuse his
blue spectacles. _
"I think I might mould her!" he sighs, clasping his moist, limp
hands.
"Mould your grandmother!" is my rather vixenish reply. It is
enough for him, and he says no more.
Why on earth cannot this mauling propose to me f I am his
senior by twenty-five years, and should know what was good for
him. I should like to see him try to "mould" me. I would
"mould" him first, with a heavy tombstone over him in his own
churchyard, before he should try such nonsense with me. But he
has not yet offered. Perhaps he may. I take to my telescope
again, and see what I can see by the assistance of an extra strong
glass.
BELLA is leaning her round, white elbow on her lap for a moment,
until her pensive look fades out of her face, and a dare-devil smile
flashes over it.
"Are you a Rollicking Ram P" she asks, abruptly.
"Not now," he answers. "WhyP"
"You cannot take my song personally, that is all. Listen!"
* What the Editor myt.—" Doe* this mean that she was sunburnt • We

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
This is BELLA'S sone, as it rings gttily out over the silent shore.
Most of you, my friends, know it well enough.*
"Come along, come along, come along!
For I am a Member of the Rollicking Rama!
Come and be a Member of the Rollicking Rams,
Out all night till broad daylight,
And never go home till morning!"
"Do you like it P " she asks.
"Immensely," he replies, and there are tears in his shaken voice.
"You are crying. Are you never merry when you hear sweet
music ?" she asks, harshly; for to her, as to most of us, in a man's
hairy, blubbered face, there is always less of the sentimental, than
of the justly irritating.
The REVEREJTO TOIIMY, still at my side, runs his feeble, dumpy
fingers through his dry straw-coloured hair, and begins to whimper
helplessly.
Can I do nothing for you?" I ask, staring at him uncom-
fortably.
Ho brightens a little.
"I should like to have my hair nicely combed," he says, simply.
From my pocket, where I generally keep a number of useful
articles, I produce a small three-legged stool, and comply with his
request. When I desist, exhausted, TOMMY sits down m a stooped,
shapeless attitude, of utter despondency.
Again I take up the telescope, and exclaim " Good Heavens!"
This is what I see, and hear.
The horse stops suddenly—brought up in the way he should not
go, shortly and sharply, by a heavily barred gate, apparently belong-
mgto a toll-house on the cliff.
The old deaf toll-keeper is the only one awake within the cottage.
He is playing the fiddle dreamily, and his sole audience is his soft, sleek
cat, purring an accompaniment before the fire. All else are asleep.
Silence tor a few moments. No sound but the "swish " of the
whip on the mare's light grey, moon-lit hide, and the cool plash of
the beady puddles kicked up by the animal's strong hind legs
against the dark splashboard of the dog-cart.
"Can you take a leap with me to-night, BELLA," DUSOVEH asks,
looking down into those dewy green wells—his darling's eyes.
"Shall we look before we leap?" replies BELLA, with a startled,
shrinking look. "Or," she says, stopping a rising sob, and trying
to realise the great plunge she was about to make, " Shall we clear
the gate without a ticket? Who 's afraid? Are you f"
CAPTAIX DUSOVER whistles softly, and looks rather too proudly
conscious of the sixteen centuries of Norman blood in his strong
fibrous veins.
Suddenly, before BELLA can utter another word, a white cow, that
has been lying by the roadside, rises slowly, majestically, ghostly as
a spectre of remorse from a grave of past memories! Tlie grey mare
starts, pricks up her ears, then forces them back, so that they incline
towards her mane, as the ripe ears of corn are bowed down beneath
the fierceness of the hurricane—then, drooping her long beautiful
head, with her wild lustrous eyes riveted on the dread apparition,
she sniffs the earth with pink, dilated nostrils, and, heaving her
gracefully curved shoulders, begins to sob hysterically, as the
autumn wind wafts one lock of her long, grey, silky tail against
DUSOVER'S swart, earnest face. In another moment, her forefeet
are rooted immovably to the soil, her hinder steel-clad hoofs glitter
in the calm, clear moonlight,—a tremendous bound—a cry—a scream
—a groan—a deep-toned moo" from the ghastly cow—a whirlwind
of dust, a volcano-like eruption of mud, stones, and slush,—and
CAPTATN DUSOVER and BELLA are flying in the air ;—the dog-cart,
shivered into ten million splinters, lies a mere wreck on the white
coast; while the cow, mad—delirious—amidst the havoc she has
caused, bursts the one tether that yet holds her to earth, and yield-
ing to an uncontrollable, curbless frenzy of passion, with one great
giant bound springs from the edge of the cliff, and disappears over
the moon!
Within the cottage the deaf toll-keeper is still fiddling away to his
cat—full, sleek-coated, and sleepy-eyed—seated by the hob, while
his good wife and family are soundly eking out their well-earned
repoae. A dish—it ii the soup-plate which CAPTAIN DCSOVEB had
placed under the seat of the dog-cart before starting from Wollum—
is rolling down the road with a bright, metal spoon, firmly wedged
into its shiny, round sides. A small, lazy, lolling, blear-eyed pug-
dog, the sole witness—save ourselves—of the abrupt catastrophe,
awakes from slumber, in the cottage garden, to bay the moon, with
* What the Editor inyt.—" Never even heard of it. We do not now un-
derstand its meaning. Are the words an attempt (we speak under correction,
a* they might be ila. TBNXYSON'S or Ma. BROWNING'S—only we don't
rememoer to have come across them in our reading, which, we admit, may
have been as limited as a modern Company's liability) at turning gome deeply
expressive compound word in some German poem into English? We should
be really glad of instruction."
What the Authorets says.—" Is 'Botch' German? Je tuit tine payianne—

canine cynicism ridiculing the vain efforts of human bipeds—his
masters, forsooth!—to oppose their puny barriers to the onward
pitiless march of what nomad philosophers call " Our Destiny."
As DUSOVER rises in the air, the rarefied atmosphere of the upward
road to Heaven clears his brain. The plump, supple form is no
longer by his side; the white, warm, round arms have disappeared.
Where is she P" he cries hoarsely, while big, heavy tears tem-
per the blaze of his agonised eyes.
A deep groan from below the cliff falls on his ear, and stabs him
to the very heart. Is she lost to him—for ever?
(To be continued.)
» What the Editor lays.—" The suggestion may be feeble, and if so you will
forgive it; but haven't we read something like the events of this chapter in
an old Nursery book of Rhymes, commencing ' Hi diddle diddle, the cat and
the fiddle' (which are realised in your old toll-keeper amusing himself in-


happens to a soup-plate in your novel). We of course see that it might have
been a pure accident, and accidents will happen in the best-regulated novels.
Don't forget the moral."—ED.
What the Authoress says.—"What are you talking about? Nursery
rhyme! Nonsense. I never was in the Nursery, and don't suppose I ever
read it. Why don't you felicitate me on the 'go-bang' of the whole thing?
Unexceptionable Moral coming."—R. D.
TALES OF MY LANDLORD.
HIT the" House I think of
taking is a model and a
marvel of domestic modern
.-irchitecture, and has been
built and fitted up under his
own personal and experi-
enced inspection, and with
a complete regardlessness of
cost.
That, to his certain know-
lodge, none but the very best
materials have been used,
and the best workmanship
employed in the construc-
tion of the dwelling, and
that wellnigh every penny
expended on the premises
has been spent with an eye
to durability, convenience
and comfort, and not for
tricky showiness or decep-
tive display.
That, although my Lease
may bind me to pay for all repairs, none can possibly be needed for
fourteen years at least; so a moderate calculation of the money
saved in this way really should in fairness be added to the rent.
That in all the neighbourhood the soil is nowhere so salubrious as
is the exact spot whereon the house is built.
That all the gas and water-pipes have thoroughly been tested,
and the drainage has received the most especial care.
That the fittings, to be taken at a valuation, are likely to be mine
at less than their prime cost.
That the fires have all been lighted in all manner of wind and
weather, and it has been fully ascertained that not one single
chimney smokes.
That, although there is a " slight odour" of paint (his language
and his sense or smell are not so strong as mine) about the passages,
it cannot penetrate the sitting-rooms, and will pass off in a week.
That the Vestry is one of the most honest and enlightened in the
Kingdom, and the district is renowned for the lowness of the rates.
That the bells are all well hung with the best of cranks and wire,
and there is not the slightest danger of their getting out of gear.
That, owing to some secret meteoric influence, higi winds are
comparatively unknown in the neighbourhood; and tie house is
therefore, so to say, insured against the elsewhere common and
expensive accidents of a falling chimney-pot or a loosened slate.
That all the window-fasteners, and locks, and knobs, and handles
are of the most durable description; and the stoves and kitchen-
range the very best that can be bought.
That the neighbourhood is free from all the usual street noises,
and that organ-grinders never venture to intrude.
That all the doors and window-frames are made of seasoned wood,
and there is no fear of their warping or admitting any draughts.
That the rent asked is far less than the house is really worth.
And, as a final clencher, that only his anxiety to have me for a
tenant (owing to his knowledge of my character or family) prevents
his now accepting higher offers for a lease.

RACE.
Ail I premature? Will anyone say that it is dishonest to describe
that grandest of contests, that noblest of sights, that magnificent
exhibition of British pluck, the University Boat-lla.ce, days before it
(as they have it on the river) "comes off"? I pity the man who
thinks so. Yes, indeed I am sorry for the creature whose heart is so
dead to every noble impulse that he cannot appreciate an account of
the " Blue .Riband of the .River " simply because time is anticipated,
and dates are hurled into space. I nave nothing to do with him—
he is not of my class; we (so to speak, and as they say at Putney)
do not " row in the same boat." It is to the true sportsman, the
honest young Englishman with rosy cheeks and curly hair, the
representative of all that is good and grand in the national charac-
ter—it is to him that I address myself. He will understand me, he
will appreciate my wonderful word-painting, he will recognise the
profound knowledge I possess of matters aquatic, his heart will beat
with mine—in a word, he will pull bow to my stroke. The Uni-
versity Boat-Race has often been described before; it is described
again. Once more, should it appear to some of the more thick-
headed of the public that the description (under the special circum-
stances of the case) is a little premature, let it be remembered that
Mr. Punch is no ordinary man, that his wealth is boundless, and
that wealth can purchase everything. Mr. Punch commissioned
his "Own Man" to write an account of the Boat-Race, and an
account oi the Boat-Race has been written. Transactions of a simi-
lar character to ours between editors and contributors have taken
place before. Men have described battles on the Continent without
leaving London; they have hunted the tiger in far Bengal, and yet
during the chase have still contrived to sleep nightly in their apart-
ments at Lower Tooting. L«t it be remembered by the thoughtless
that one Boat-Race is the counterpart of the others, and then " good
luck to us all." Ring the bell, take off your hats in front, and clear
the course!"
THE ROAD.
"What sort of day is it?" was the popular question in the early
morning of April 8th. Dukes reclining on couches set with jewels
and curtained with cloth of silver and gold, put the question to their
countless domestics; and costermongers, taking their fevered heads
out of the coal-skuttles in which they had deposited them the night
before, made the same inquiry of their "old women." And what
was the weather? Well, to some people it would have appeared a
bright, sunny spring day. Others might have declared that it
rained heavily, and was bitterly cold. Way, some might have said
it snowed. After all, the weather is a mere matter of opinion; and
such was the weather on the 8th of April, 1876.
From an early hour the roads leading to the scene of the contest
were thronged with pedestrians and vehicles. Who does not know
the scene? Who does not remember the hansoms, four-wheelers,
stanhopes, broughams, and family coaches? Why, it is a twice-told
tale, as stale as the news of the decease of Her Majesty QUEEN
ANNE. Shall I tell this tale thrice? Shall I, who have seen the
most glorious sights in the world—the mighty Niagara, the frowning
Rock of Gibraltar, the twinkling lights of the Rue de Riyoli—shall
I descend to such homely stuff as this? Never! I will content
myself with one or two sketches.
First, a roomy carriage rilled with a bevy of pretty girls all
dressed exactly alike. Their beauty was the same—hazel eyes Ian-

pagne! And why did they look so happy f Because the man they
loved, the man any one of them would have willingly taken for a
husband, was with them. A gay young bishop was the lucky fellow.
"It was too bad of you, my Lord, to ask Mamma to get out while
we ascended that last hill, and then to leave her behind! I am
sure we shall never find her again! "—I heard one of the fair
creatures say to the young ecclesiastic. The Bishop's cheery laugh
was heard for yards round, and once more he began to amuse them.
Well, and why should not a Bishop put on a false nose if Beauty-
smiles? I envied them their beauty, and him his luck, an(l
passed on.
An open window. I nodded right and left, for this was a tableau
of celebrities. There was an eminent Comedian, talking to a not
less eminent Statesman; and the Editor of a Newspaper was ex-
plaining to a great General the theory of war; a celebrated Dissent-
ing Minister (who had come to see his University win) was smiling
at the sallies of wit of a famous writer of opera-bouffe books.
And what a background of loveliness! I had to shade my eyes
with my Hand as I noticed that the female portion of the Chorus at
the Opera had apparently come to see the Race en masse. Later in
the day, I found that the celebrities of the day had, BO to speak,
thawed, and were gaily dancing quadrilles with their fair com-
panions. Ah! beauty and genius! It ia good to be wise, but better
still to be young and lovely I
And the crowd. Officers in the Guards, in State uniform, rub-
bing shoulders with Barristers, who had run out of Chancery Lane
just to see the Race; Conjurors; Brass-bands; Punch Shows; Circus
Processions (greatly impeding, by the way, circulation on the towing-
path); and hearses. Here was a Bridegroom who had, on the way
home from church, taken his blushing Bride to see "the finish;
there a Company uf M(mrntT3, who had stayed awhile to hail the
victory of the Winning Llue. Oh! it was a grand sight! Once
seen, never forgotten—and, never forgotten, always described!
THE RrvEB.
It is not every wiseacre who can say whether the River is smooth
or rough. Sometimes there may be waves that look to the short-
sighted like ripples. Then why describe the state of the River on
the ever-memorable 8th of April? To the learned it would be an
insult, to the unlearned it would be an injury! So the state of the
River shall not be described.
Plenty of boats, barges, steam-launches, and outriggers! Here
was an elderly man in a tub, pulling as if for dear life, and yet
smiling with a glee scarcely befitting his grey hairs. Who was he?
By the respectful manner in which the River-Police saluted him,
evidently some one of consequence. Was he the LOED CHIEF JUS-
TICE, or CARDINAL MANNING, or ME. GLADSTONE? Who can say. on
a day like this? and so he passes on. The steamers soon give him
their wash, and the tub disappears.
And now it is time for the Race. The bunting either flies gaily
in the crisp sunshine, or hangs heavily in the wet. There is a snout
—and a mighty one. "They are off! It has been said before, and
it will be said again.
THE RACE.
The boats left Putney together. One of the Blues was on the
Middlesex side, the other hugged Surrey. And so they started,
pulling a stroke which had eight oars to give it the necessary
impetus.
The Water-Works were neared and passed; the Gravel Pits
followed the same fate. Off Chiswick it was anybody's race 1 "Go
it, Oxford!" "Cambridge wins!" were the rival cries as the
two boats steadily pursued their way. Every sinew cracked, every
muscle was stretched to the utmost.
And oh! what a shout there was at Hammersmith as the rival
crews came in sight! And how the people cheered at Barnes and
Mortlake! Hark to the gun! 'Tis over. The expectant enthusiasm
of the year is concentrated into the madness of a thrilling quart
<Pheure! Oh, it was a noble race nobly won. Both victors and
vanquished deserved well of their respective "Varsities," (as the
Universities are called by members of the less important Colleges at
Oxford and Cambridge), and no one was surprised at
THE RESULT.
The Oxford and Cambridge Boat-Race of 1876 was won on Satur-
day, April 8th, by the Light Dark Blue. The time (as taken by
BENSON 8 chronometer) was about twenty minutes—a minute or so
more or less either way.
And thus it will be seen that (as usual) the best men were the
victors! Ixmg may it be so; and long may we be there to see it,
and to tell the tale!

A QUESTION TO BE ASKED.
New Carnivora House, Regent's Park, April 1, 1876.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,
ON the authority of MR. DISRAELI, we are informed that
the "Royal Titles Bill" is to have a strictly local operation. I wish,
therefore, to know whether the tigers residing in our Indian pos-
sessions will be affected by its operation.
Will it be correct in future to speak of a Royal Bengal Tiger?
Here, in the Zoo, I suppose this designation will still hold. But in
India itself must not "Royal" be exalted to " Imperial"?
If so, I hope the tigers will feel a proper sense of their dignity,
and improve accordingly in their manners, tastes, and tempers,
particularly now that they, like the other native rulers, have had
the advantage of becoming more nearly acquainted with that model
of urbanity and good-temper, H.R.H. the PRINCE OF WALES.
MR. DISRAELI, though unsuccessful with LOWE forms of human
nature, may, perhaps, like Orpheus with his lute, be able with his
Act to tame that of the savage brute—
"Dictus ob hoc lenire tigres."
I remain, dear Mr. Punch, yours,
A WOULD-BE IMPERIALIST.

ELIGIBLE TENEMENTS.
OME few days ago
there occurred
on a railway an
uncommon kind
of accident—un-
common in that
the Directors
were not to
blame for it.
The carcases of
a pair of hotises
that were being
built iu the
Earl's-Court
Road, adjoining
the Earl's-Court
Station, sud-
denly tumbled
down upon the
line with a crash
in a heap of
ruins which
blocked it for
three hours.
This catastrophe
occurred about
midday, just as
the carpenters
inside the new-
ly-raised edifice,
finishing off the
flooring, were
about to leave
work for re-
freshment—the beverage " brother chips " and other workmen term
their "twelveses." Several'of these poor fellows were badly hurt,
and one is reported to have died. The fall of therhouses imme-
diately followed the passing of a London and North-Western train,
of which the last carriage had a narrow escape.' It is supposed that
the vibration caused by the transit of the train" shook them down.
These structures, while standing, were evidently specimens of an
order of domestic architecture, examples of model suburban dwell-
ing-houses for the middle classes. It is comparatively fortunate
that they fell to pieces when they did, instead of remaining to be
completed, and soon after that to topple jipon their tenants, over-
whelming perhaps a diligent clerk ot an establishment in the City,
together with the wife of his bosom, a child or a lot of children, a
baby in arms, and a maid-of-all-work. In re-erecting those typical
eligible tenements, perhaps some care will be taken that their con-
struction shall not bo so shamefully scamped as to render a tragical
occurrence of that description too highly probable.

OUR CORRESPONDENCE.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
Downing Street, April 1, 1876.
I CRAVE the publicity of your columns to dissipate some of
the fears which are abroad in connection With the Royal Titles Bill.
The Royal Arms will not be altered in this country. But in
India, yielding to a wish which has long been felt and at last openly
expressed in the Bazaars and Xenanas, Her Majesty's Government
have advised that the Lion and Unicorn should be replaced by
the Tiger and Elephant, as creatures more imposing to the Oriental
imagination.
Not a bar of our glorious National Anthem will be touched. In
the words some changes, to be strictly localised and confined to
India, must of necessity be made. The few leisure moments I ortn
command I am employing in recasting the Anthem in English, Hin-
dustani, and Tamil; and I hope in the course of to-day to send you
a rough draft, that I may have the benefit of your sagacious and
good-natured criticism, before submitting my new version to
Parliament.
P^Her Majesty's Government would view with horror and amazement
any attempt to interfere—certainly in Great Britain and Ireland—
with those familiar and time-honoured letters V. R., which have sent
a thrill through so many loyal hearts, and can never be read without
emotion on our mail-carts and pillar-boxes, and on the lead pencils
which are daily and hourly wielded by the Civil Servants of the Crown.
I trust that these explanations will calm the public mind and
restore tranquillity to the national pulse.
I am, my dear Mr. Punch,
Yours very faithfully, B. D r.
DEAB PUNCH,
I CAN guess your thoughts at the present hour when the
excitement is growing every moment deeper and more intense.
They are not fixed on the Budget, or the Royal Title, or the Uni-
versity of Oxford Bill, but on the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-
Race; and you are yearning to know which University will be
victorious on the 8th. I can tell you, for I have seen every race for
the last twenty years. I hare watched every movement of the two
crews since they were at the two Universities. I am on the river-
bank all day long, and sleep alternately at Putney and Mortlake.
Don't be guided by LORD SALISBURY, or either of the Vice-
Chancellors; or even the most knowing of the Heads of Houses, but
pin your faith on me, and then you will wear the winning colours
next Saturday. Take time by the row-lock, and meet me at once
opposite the Soap-Works. I wear a white hat, with a blue ribbon.
Putney, Saturtla,/. Yours' CoRNEt REACH.
MR. PUNCH,
COME and witness my great and unprecedented feat of
walking 10.000 miles in 10,000 hours. In the outer Circle, Regent's
Park, roped in and kept clear by the Mounted Police, illuminated
after dusk, military bands playing all day and night long, fireworks
at the expiration of every mile, vocal and instrumental concert at
the end of each week. Referees from every nation in the world,
umpires in all languages, judges from all the Courts of Law in
Europe and America. Admission, One shilling; season-tickets, a
Pound.
Hare and Tortoise, N. W., 1 April. FELTS FOOTIT.
DEAE MR. PUNCH,
IT will give us much pleasure if you can act as Interrogator
at a grand Spelling Bee which we propose to hold in the Royal
Albert Hall in Easter week. There is no one in whom the Committee
would feel such-absolute confidence. We have engaged six military
bands, and the choruses of the two Opera Houses, and we hope to
induce the Moore and Burgess Minstrels to give us their invaluable
assistance. Our Bee will take a wide range, and settle on many
branches of knowledge. Spelling, and Definitions, and Proper
Names, will, of course, be included, but, besides, we propose that you
should test Candidates in Modern Languages, Chronology, Cookery,
Domestic and Political Economy, Physical Geography, Moral Philo-
sophy, and the Higher Mathematics.
Our prizes will be worth the struggle. They will include a
furnished house, a carefully selected and handsomely bound library,
a complete trousseau, and a fine organ—built expressly for the
competition by those eminent makers, MESSRS. BELLOWS & BLOW.
Signed, on behalf of the Committee,
KNIGHTSBRIDGE AND BROMPTON, Chairman.
Committee Room, April 1, 1870.
PUNCH, old man, why did you not come on Monday? I particu-
larly wanted you to see, before I sent it in a special van to the
Academy, what I fearlessly assert to be the greatest picture of the
year. What do you say to a canvas 32 feet by 18? Well filled, too
—not an inch of sjmce " to let." You know the subject. One of the
grandest events in the annals of modern civilisation—one of those
critical turning-points in the history of peoples and dynasties: '' His
Highness the KHEDIVE or EGYPT in the act of affixing his signature
and seal to the transfer of his shares in the Sue/ Canal to the British
Government." Painted for the new Town-hall at Cairo.
How often have we discussed the treatment! I have made one or
two slight changes since our last conversation on the subject. Now
the KHEDIVE is surrounded by his Ministers, Grand Muftis, Drago-
mans, Bashi-Bazouks, Pachas, Effendis, Camels, and Foreign Ad-
visers: he is in the act of dipping his pen in a splendid cold
standish, and looking, a little anxiously, at the Sphinx. The
Pyramids, irradiated by the sotting sun, form the background; the
Nile, guarded by the Sphinx and Memnon, is in the middle distance;
and the Canal itself fills up the foreground. All the figures are life-
size; and the buildings, palm-trees, dates, dahabeeahs, &c., are
done to scale. I hope to see you at the Private View, and show
you my picture myself. So I will not dwell upon details, except
just to mention that, exercising a pictorial licence, I have introduced
one of the zinc cases in which the Share Certificates were transported
to this country. I think you will say that the painting of this
interesting accessory is life-like. Ever yours
Kensington, Saturdai/. SEBASTIAN ANDREW DAWBNEY.
[There is one singular circumstance about this Correspondence
which we cannot quite fathom. All the letters have the same date,
and were received on the same day—Saturday the First.—ED.]

mentary report of Friday's Times, alludes to Shipowners as " Re-

moved his Resolution praying the Queen
X the Roval
Titles Bill
(Lords, Mon-
day, April 3),
LORD SHAFTES-
to take a Title
BURY
more in accordance with history and JOHN BULL'S feeling?
than that of Empress—which may fairly be said to have been
received by the Nation with the reverse of Emprcssement. In vain
LORD SHAFTESBraY—who for party has not given up what was meant
for mankind—reurged all that has been urged already against this
ill-starred move in a wrong direction. In vain LORDS SEI.HORNE,
SANDHURST, ROSEBERY, HOUGHTON, pressed the reasons against
"That word of fear,
Unpleasing in an English car,"
that most commend themselves to the legal, lay, military, and
literary minds. Ministers have hardened their Hearts, and stand
upon their majoritv, such as it is. In the Lords, 137 to 91 is not a
very commending division, with 200 Peers standing aloof too. LORD
CAIRNS and LORD CARNARVON tried to argue that the dislike to
"Empress"is factious and factitious. They know it is neither.
The CHANCELLOR thinks the title can be localised. He reckons
without his JENKINS.
In the meantime let official Conservatism take note that it is
unofficial Conservatism which utters protests, "not loud, but
deep," against this bartering of a new Crown for an old one, which
the soundest sense of England feels is likely to bring no more
blessing to Q.fEEN VICTORIA than yielding to the analogous
temptation of "new lamps for old ones" did to QUKEN BADROOL-
BADOOR. Will no QUEEN'S friend show HER MAJESTY Mr. Punch's
Cartoon? To ALFONSO THE WISE'S famous triad of old things that
are the best things—"Old Wine, Old Books, Old Friends "—let
Punch, ALFONSO'S successor in wisdom, add " Old Titles." On our
Crowned Head rested the oldest, most honoured, and most honour-
able Title in Europe. Ill-advisers have marred it by an "addi-
tion." which should be called a subtraction. No wonder Re-
publicanism at home sneers, and Republicanism abroad chuckles,
over this lowering of the Royal Style.
All this is on the supposition that the QUEEN wishes for, and
...cans to assume, the Empress. But query, does she'( What
Royal act or word from the beginning of her reign till now, has
showed her unable, or unwilling, to read the signs of the times—to
recognise and respect the genuine will of her people'( Punc-h has
already told her, in his own way, that " the Queen with Two Heads''
is »vt one of the signs of the time; whereas the old "Queen's
Head " is a sign for times past, present, and to come; and he can't, for
the life of him, believe that QUEEN VICTORIA is not just as well aware
if the fact as her most faithful Public and Privy Councillor Punch.
(Cowwon*.)—Make way for the Budget! MR. BULL'S Bills for
the year, "foot up," the imposing total of rather more than
£78,000,000! To meet this extremely handsome outlay, the House
TOL. LXI. P
Steward hopes to be able to lay his hands on £77.250,000, leaving
him nearly £800,000 short. So there is nothing for it but putting
his hand into master's pocket for another penny 'in the pound on
the poor old Gentleman's—we beg his pardon—the wealthy, old
Gentleman's income, and this will give House Steward NORTHCOTE,
some £364,000 more than he wants to make both ends meet! Such
is the Budget in brief.
My dear BULL, you must pay for voiir blessings; and a Conservative
Government is not one that can be had for nothing. True, when
MR. GLADSTONE, once, in a moment of rash anticipation, promised to
get rid of Income-tax altogether, DISRAELI met him by the asser-
tion, that abolition of Income-tax was peculiarly Conservative
policy. But SIR STAFFORD explains that only meant if and -when
the Government could do without it. So far from being able to do
without it just now, they want an extra penny- But they will do
their best to make the rise easy to the middle-class elector, by
raising the limit of exemption from £100 to £150, the amount of
deduction from £80 to £120; all incomes up to .£400 to have the
advantage of the deduction.
In this way the rise will bo felt only by those who are too com-
fortable to complain, or too well-off for their complaints to find
sympathy from the masses. All with less than £400 a-year will be
better off under the new tariff than under the old one. If this is
questionable political economy, it is like enough to be popular
policy, and will secure the Government against the opposition of
those who turn the scale at Elections.
Tuesday (Lords).—LORD INCTIIQUTN moved the Second Reading
of his Bill to limit the further creation of a very useless and unhappy
order of beings—Irish Peers, who, where real lairds come, may be
best described as neither fish, flesh, nor good red herring—the Irish
Bulls of the Peerage. But while prohibiting any further creation
of these objectionable abortions of aristocracy, he proposed to add
four to their representatives in the House of Lords, to make up for
as many Irish Spiritual Peers improved off the face of the Green
Isle. Punch doesn't' quite see the logic of this. LORD INCHIQUTN
would also open Irish boroughs to Irish Peers, who may now repre-
sent English but not Irish constituencies. Anything to give these
p_oor creatures an enlarged field of usefulness. If an Irish Peer can
find an eccentric English borough to elect hiin, why should we not
have that chance, and the borough that pleasure? It seems odd to

(Commons/.—A good deal of bother in arranging; for a night for
PROFESSOR FAWCETT'S Farewell to the Royal Titles Bill. After much
nro and con. it seems the House is not to have this treat till after
Easter.
The Whiskey War!—
"Irish spirits and Scotch,
In the hot mtlt'e
Mingle, mingle, mingle,
Ye that mingle may!"
A spirited debate—as was to be expected. The 0'SrLi.ivAN opened,
denouncing, in the name of the public health, the pernicious prac-
tice, now sanctioned by law, of adulterating Irish Whiskey in Bond
with inferior Scotch spirit, under the specious name of " blending,"
ind callingonthe Government to become bonded warehousemen on the
.argest scale, by keeping all spirits and whiskey in bond till it was
:welve years' old—had sown its wild oats in the shape of fusel
oil, and mellowed to a drink equally wholesome and delieious.
Then ANDERSON arose and raised the slogan of the Scottish Still—
that "Still" whence Silent Spirit flows!—the Silent Spirit which
Iocs not seem to be the ruling spirit of the House of Commons,
rle declared "blending " was not adulteration but improvement;
;hat Irish whiskey unmixed was an unmixed evil, "full of head-
aches to the brim,'" only to be drunk with impunity bv natives—
as snake-charmers are said to swallow cobra-poison—put to the
world at large only to be made tolerable by a liberal infusion of
'Scotch," that pure and healthful blood of JOHN BARLEYCORN, which
leither is an enemy in men's mouths, nor a stealer away of their
rrains, but circulates in the shape of health, and utters itself in
words of wisdom!
Then Sra W. LAWSOX arose and chaffed impartially both cham-
)ions, of Scotch and Irish—
"Tros Tyriusque illi nullo discrimine agendus."
[Tie better the whiskey the worse—in SIR WILFRID'S eyes—because
he more tempting. "More blame was laid on fusel oil than it ought
o bear." To SIR WILFRID the "fusel oil" is as the salmon that
sears the burden of Greenwich compotations—an innocent and
much-wronged creature.
MR. SULLIVAN said something like ditto to SIR WILFRID.
SIR W. CUNNINGHAM contributed one wise and weighty saying to
he debate:—
"If bad Scotch spirits were prevented from (toing to Ireland, there would
be plenty of bad Irish spirits to take their place."

quarrel as it stands, declined to interfere, by 145 to 69; and the im-

Desultory and ineffectual talk about the Slave Trade and the

his views in vain upon a large and variously recruited Majority.
Thursday (Lords).—The LORD CHANCELLOR will not give the
House of Commons an opening for new discussion of the Royal
Titles Bill. He thinks "Localisation" may be secured by pro-
clamation, without amendment of the Bill.
(Common*.)—In answer to LORD HARHNOTON;, SIR STAFFORD does
not consider it the duty of Her Majesty's Ministers to initiate a
financial policy for the KHEDIVE. They nave done quite enough in
bringing down his Stocks some twenty per cent, in as many days.

Friday (Lords).—Royal Titles Bill again. LORD SELBORNE doubts
whether,—
"Localisation by Proclamation
In Law may not be bad,"
and JOHN BULL may finish the adaptation,—
"A Queen with Two Heads bothers me,
And ' Empress' drives me mud."
CAIRNS tried to pooh-pooh SELBORNE. But when such Doctors
differ, Punch will still hope, with LORD DENMAN, that the QUEEN
will still go by the old style, seeing that her subjects can't get over
the new one.
(Commons).—Some wretch, not having the fear of the Sergeant-
at-Arms before his eyes, has been signing the highly respectable
name of NEWDEOATE to some indecorous petitions, insinuating nasty
things of convents, and their rules, practices, and inmates.
MR. CALLAN moved the offensive petitions off the table. As their
proper destination clearly was the dust-hole, ME. NEWDEGATE was
ill-advised in resisting the motion for a moment, though the petition
was one against his pet bugbear.
MR. SPEAKER submits to the House a curious question, "Shall a
petition from Boulogne (signed by French, as well as English inha-
bitants, of that hybrid sea-port), that their Consul may not sink to
Vice, be received by the House f"
MR. DISRAELI is for receiving it; MR. GLADSTONE, on the whole,
for declining to receive. It is not desirable (he thinks) to encourage
petitions against what might be a proper use of the Treasury cheese-
parers. Besides, to lend an ear to such a prayer, might stimulate
Consuls to get up an agitation against their degradation to Vices,
or set Vices trying to raise themselves to Consuls. Much as this
might seem to tend to morality, a good deal was said, and evidently
more remains to be said, on both sides. The point is to be referred
to a Committee, as it ought to be.
MR. KNATCHBULL-HUGESSEN aired a matter which much interests
the Upper Ten—the grievances of Assistant Public School Masters.
BROWNING'S case was lengthily discussed.
MR. CROSS interposed his mitis sapientia as usual, and doubted if
such public washing of their dirty linen benefited either Schools or
Masters, parents or pupils. Punch shares the doubt. The House
did well—he thinks—to decline granting a Select Committee. Oh,
for an hour of old KEATE! Fancy the House of Commons offering
to interfere with Aim /
The removal of Woolwich Arsenal and the punching of MR.
PALMER'S head were then discussed with much emphasis, though
to uncommonly small audiences, and the varied evening's entertain-
ment wound up with the favourite farce of '' Votes in Supply "!

THE Children of Israel, under a PHARAOH, were op-

cent, on Egyptian Bonds. "Thus the whirligig of Time

A NEW BACONIAN ESSAY.
MUCH excitement has been caused by the announcement of an
article in a Contemporary, with the startling title, The Latest
Theories about Bacon. Since the advertisement appeared, the trade
in a very favourite and useful article of food has been almost at a
standstill, buyers and sellers being equally unwilling to engage in
any extensive transactions until they knew whether revelations
were likely to be made affecting the character of a commodity of
large consumption, and representing a great pecuniary value.
Bacon has hitherto, on the whole, stood high in public estimation,
although some descriptions have been more fancied than others; but
if " Theories " are to oe started and publicly discussed, perhaps to its
detriment and disparagement, an injury may be inflicted on a most
estimable item of domestic consumption, welcome both at the break-
fast and dinner-table, and equally relished in the castle of the peer
and the cottage of the peasant, from which it may never again be
able to rally.
If Sausages had been made the subject of comment and specula-
tion, but scant surprise would have been felt, and the market would
probably have shown little or no sympathy with the attack; but to
do anytning which may shake the credit of Bacon is a very serious
proceeding, and one the consequences of which may be felt for years
to come, alike by the wealthy Wiltshire farmer and the humblest i
cotter in the remotest county of Ireland. Since the publication of
the Essay on Irish Bulls, we can recall no occurrence which has
produced a similar sensation. The writers of articles in Reviews
and Magazines should be careful what titles they prefix to their
lucubrations. In the present instance, a rasher one could hardly
have been devised.
POETRY AND PRONUNCIATION.
UNDER the title of "Purple versus Grey" the Post publishes a
piece of poetry, advocating the cause of "Purple," and signed
Winehilsea." This flight of genius extends to nine verses. Here
is the first of them:—
"Good People of England, attend to my lay,
Which treats of the Purple compared with the Grey,
And plainly declares that all facts are a farce
When riew'd through the light of a strong party glass."

tion he will perhaps remember that'' glass " is commonly considered

Astronomy Royal.
A Correspondent of Qalignani, having enumerated the illustrious
personages, the QRAWD DUKE and DUCHESS OF BADEN, the DUKE OF
EDINBURGH. PRINCE Louis and PRINCESS ALICE OF HESSE, and the
EMPEROR WILLIAM, expected to be shortly present with the QUEEN
at her Continental abode, informs us that—
"There is also a rumour that the EMPRESS OF AUSTRIA, on her return
from England about tha same time, may join this galaxy, if but for a day."
He seems to forget that a galaxy, however brilliant, can be visible
only at night. Also that the Milky Way is supposed to consist of
innumerable myriads of stars, not merely of spmeTialf-dozen. Per-
haps, when he called six or seven Royal luminaries a galaxy, what
he meant to say was a constellation.

GONE WRONG!
A NEW NOVEL. BY MISS RHODY DENDRON,
Aulhvrtss of " Cometh Doivn like a S/unver," "Bed in the Nose is She,"
"Good/ Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, Bid don't Tell."
CHAPTER IV.— WhaQfie Author says.
^ -^^^~^^~~ ^' s^e ^as fallen
r-^ below the sheer
cliff, where the
merry gulls sing
their sweet
pteans to the
wind-blown, un-
punctual, irregu-
lar, disappoint-
ing, unapologetic
** fc - sea, and lies, her
beautiful head
buried kit-cat
length down-
wards, in the
muddy sand, her
gleaming balmo-
rals appealing
for aid with a
mighty implor-
ing clicking of
the high heels
aloft, while with
her lavender kid
gloves she is
clutching at unhappy molluscs and killing innumerable shrimps and
sand-eels in her struggle for life.
DCSOVER at one glance saw the balmorals — they were, alas!
the only morals that interested him—and, exclaiming to himself,
"By Jove! sand-eels—I mean sand Aeels." he took the plunge,
and was at her side in an instant, raising her gently, and placing
her on a bank of sweet, fragrant-scented, long-dry seaweed.
Her gown clings to her limbs like a mask of soft putty, and defines
her form.
"Not hurt, only a little shocked," she exclaimed, gaspingly, as
she pushes back her flabby hair, and shivers. Then she sings out
cheerily—
"And right to the bottom,
All kivered up o' mud,
Went the pretty Little Ratcatcher's Daughter.
Do you remember the chorus?"
"Yes."
"Let us sing it together."
"Let's."
And they began—his deep, sonorous, tin-like, minor-canon tone,
harmonising, touchingly, with the clear, resonant, treble-bob-major
pitch—a pitch that no one conld touch without suffering the con-
sequences—of her rich mezzo, as they sang the immortal words of
that sublime chorus, composed by one of England's greatest, if
least known, bards—
"A doodle dee, a doodle dum,
A dum di doodle day!"
And again—
"Doodle dee, doodle dum,
Dum di doodle day!"
The next moment they were rolling over and over on the dry sand
and the seaweed-covered rocks.*
A yellow light plays on his hairy face from the heights above. It
eomes from the candles held by the old toll-keeper and his family,
who are at the several windows of their cottage, surveying the
strange scene, aghast at the manners and customs of these visitors
to Wollum,
"Get out, you snobs!" shouted DUSOVKB, and the casements closed
* What the Editor says (m correspondence with the Authoress).—"'Kolling
over and over.' We have some doubt as to the propriety of admitting this
line. Our Editing Committee (our Doctor, our Solicitor, and Ourselves with
a casting vote) are now sitting on it. We send this note by special messenger,
and are anxiously awaiting answer before going to Press. Does the line mean
'rolling over and over together' or ' separately'? You see it makes all the
difference. £.S. V.P. tris prest*."—ED.
What the Authore»s toys (in reply to the above).—"It's just as well to
leave something to the imagination. Each reader will take them to roll sepa-
rately or together, as best suits his or her fancy, ffoiii soit yni mal y poise

on the honest peasants, who returned respectfully to their well-earned
slumbers, thinking that what they had seen was but the spectral
illusion of a late and heavy supper, troubling their repose in the
middle of the remorseful night.
Then he clasped her in his vice-like arms, and kissed her
repeatedly.*
BELLA," he said, hoarsely, as her head nestled close to his big,
broad chest.
She looked up into his lurid, hungry eyes with hers, so dew-soft
yet spirited, while her blood-red lips, half parted, murmured,
DTJSOVER, I will marry you!"
CHAPTER V.— JFTiat Jenny says. ,
WE are on the spot, the REV. THOMAS HASSOCK, and myself.
The farmer, seated on his gradually collapsing concertina, which,
sighing Out its latest breath, sinks wheezfly to earth beneath the
light pressure of jpoor dejected TOMMY, who, rendered momentarily
heavier by his weight of woe, is mournfully regarding the entranced
couple, happily unconscious of his proximity.
The shrimps are skipping about blithely, the prawns are drowsily
humming among the rocks, a lobster is toying with a crab, a cockle
is giving them his broad, warm smile; the tremulous whelks are
bathing silently in the opaline gulfiets. pearly lights shine from the
half-open, bad, -nicked oysters, and the great, big, strong mussels
are straining themselves, in pla3"f ul gymnastic exercises, on the low
sun-bar. All is silent, all is drowsy, and the new moon, appearing
among the old bhtse stars, smiles with all the bashful timidity of a
pale/bright, maiden, at her first ball.
"What on earth are you doing here on the sea-shore?" I ask,
stupidly enough.
We drove here," answers BELLA, briskly, "to call on the tide,
and do the civil thing. But when we came we found the tide was
out, and isn't expected to be in again for some hours."
Poor TOMMY hears this, and murmurs softly to himself, "She is a
dear, good girl, and really fond of parish work."
For a moment DUSOVER has turned away. I am recovering my
scattered senses, and BELLA is looking towards the sea. Her head is
thrown forward, and the absence of the crumpled white tie, which
has tumbled oft, displays a white, carven, blue-veined neck, which
TOMMY gazes on with passionate, yet painful, admiration. He steals
towards ner on tiptoe, and she is unconscious of his presence behind
her back. He stoops over her, and his lips are so close to her soft,
warm hair, how can he help laying them yet closer? Men never
resist any temptation as long as there is no one to tell of them, and as
long as their pocket is not affected.t This temptation offers peculiar
advantages, as I shall shut my eyes—he might be induced to repeat
the performance on me, the elder and plainer sister—and site will
not object to what gives him a bitter joy.
Having once kissed her, a shame comes over him, he sighs, and,
taking up his blue umbrella, he fixes his green spectacles on his
moist pink eyes, spreads out his concertina, and singing softly, with
a suspicion of tears in his voice,
"I 'vc gone wrong for the sake of SABAH,"
he trudges off along the high road, and disappears into the darkness
of the summer night.
"Good-bye, sweetheart, .good-bye!" cries BELLA, as the tail of a
black shadow cat flics her eye. Then suddenly seeing me, she jumps
UP, exclaiming, "You mustn't let the poor little gentleman go
without his best suit of black. What can 1 do?"
"I have brought your dress in a bag," I say, exhibiting my usual
good common sense, and then add, authoritatively, "The sooner you
change, the better."
"*A la bonne heure!" she cries, and accompanies me to the toll-
keeper's house, where, in an inner chamber, she re-makes her
toilette, and I pack up the REV. TOMMY HASSOCK'S clothes in the
bag. Her masquerading frolic is over.
* What the Editor says (to our Reader»).—" As there was considerable
difference of opinion as to the advisability of permitting this line to remain,
and as the employment of the casting vote, in a party of three, only left matters
just where they were before, it was decided (there being no time to spare, as
the Press was waiting) to use the powers possessed by the Committee of adding
to its number, and so we sent a boy, with a cab, from our office, and fetched a
Maiden Aunt (the first we could find—between forty-five and fifty), who at
once complied with our request, and was accommodated with a seat at the
board. She has read the novel with great pleasure, as far as it hae yet gone,
and has decided on retaining the line in question about' kissing repeatedly.'
She says she thinks it gives local colour to the novel. Perhaps she is right.
Our Doctor and our Solicitor are inclined to agree with her; and, if fine, we
are all going to dine at Greenwich on turtle, whitebait, and dry champagne.
The Committee has still power to add to its number, and, perhaps it would
be as well (in the interest of our lady-readers) if the female element in it
were to be proportionally increased. VTe know several very but the
Press is waiting, and so is the Greenwich Train."—ED.
t By the Editor.—The male portion of the Editorial Committee objected
strongly to this sentiment. Our Maiden Aunt, however, strenuously opposed
any alteration of the text. We think this explanation due to the Public. - ED.

"JEJTNY," says BELLA to me, when her toilette is completed,
"DUSOVER likes me very much. We shall be married."
"BELLA," I return, reddening with indignation at her insane
conduct, " I have heard about this man. He is ugly, irreligious,
ill-tempered t fierce, stingy, greedy, dissipated, and a drunkard," I
say, with rising exasperation.
"He is 1" she replies, with a triumphant smile; "but as I like
ugliness, irreligion, ill-temper, ferocity, stinginess, greediness,
dissipation, and the bottle — with one who combines all these
qualities in himself, my married life must be one of unalloyed
happiness."
It is impossible to answer this argument. Even in logic, BELLA
invariably gets the better of me.
"But, I say to my wayward!sister, " you will return with me
toWollum."'
"I am not going back to Wollum," replies BELLA; "at least, not
yet."
"Do, there's a dear good child!" I say. coaxingly.
"I will not!" returns the dear good child.
"You want to stop with that scarlet-haired man!" I say,
vixenish!}1.
"He is not scarlet-haired!" cries BELLA, in a fury. "Go away^"
she screams, stomping her foot violently.
"Perhaps,"! say, giving in—I am the .elder sister, and have
always been accustomed to give iu to BELLA, whenever she screams
and stamps—" perhaps I had better run after MR. HASSOCK, with his
bag: he will want his suit for Sunday," I add, with my usual
material view of things.
So I leave her, and walk in the direction which I think the un-
happy, little, broken-hearted clergyman has already taken. But I
still have the powerful telescope with me, by whose aid I can sec,
and hear distinctly, what is going on in the dark blue night-time by
the grey sea-shore.
CHAP. VI.— What the Author says,
FOB a moment BELLA paused before returning to DUSOVER
BELJAMBE. She listened with strained attention. Thud after thud
struck the dry, parched, rocky ground, the sound conveying to her
mind the notion of some strong, powerful man employed in lifting
weights out of a box, and letting them fall on the dull, muffled
earth. Unable to resist the temptation, she descended the sheer
cliff with the steadiness of a trained creeper, and, peering in between
two immense boulders, saw DUSOVER BELJAMBE heaving big, over-
burdening sighs out of his great, deep chest.
She felt within herself that she too must share his fearful grief,
and so, in her new dress, cheerful, deep-faced, metamorphosed, she
stands before him.
He rushed to her, and clasped her in his strong embrace.
"My little, pure, white snowdrop!" he exclaimed, bending down
his long, brown neck, and gazing, ravenously, on the small face,
cavernous full mouth, pouting, ripe lips, and glorious wealth of sun-
coloured, autumn-scented hair, which any three mighty sovereigns,
of reddest carat-gold, could scarcely have purchased.
DUSOVER felt himself irresistibly drawn towards her by capillary
attraction,—to this fair creature, in her plain, uncoquettish, simple
attire. An oranga-coloured riband snopded over her pin-like head
in the innoeentest, freshest manner possible, while the crown of nut-
brown-sherry hair, turned up in one great bunch which she could
twist into form at the rate of twenty knots an hour,—the nuttiest,
brownest, goldenest, sherriest, hairiest hair over her alabastercst
temple
"That ever you did see,"
formed a rare frame for her liquidest, southernest, innoeentest,
rosebudest, shyest, translucentest, pinkest-geraniumest face, whose
great glow of unutterable gladness revealed a sunrise of enormous
Love to the hungry tenderness of his dear, gorging, famished eyes.
She flung herself on to his breast, ana then—gently shook his
hand.*
* What the Editor says (in'a letter to the Authorcss).—" We (the Com-
mittee, including the latest addition to our number) have decided upon
omitting the remainder of this paragraph. At one time it was proposed (by
the Chair) that the entire passage should be left out, but our Maiden Aunt
(who enjoyed the Greenwich dinner yesterday immensely) forcibly argued,
from the suggestion (in your latest note to Ourselves, my dear Madam) about
'leaving something to the imagination,' that, while your admirable description
is (as the lady in question demonstrated) strictly true to nature, it is just a
trifle too garish in colour, and this defect we (the Committee) have therefore
remedied, by the substitution of the neutral-tinted line 'and then gently
shook his hand,' which, after all, ia quite in keeping with the situation, and
(with our contract as to the morale of this novel), does artistically leave a
considerable amount to the imagination. Should you not be entirely with
us in this matter, we are afraid your communication will arrive too late, as
the chapter is now going to Press."—ED.
What the Authoress says,—"You know the proverb about pearls. Tour
Aunt (who seems to be a thoroughly sensible person) writes to mo privately to
say, that, if she could have had her way, the whole passage should have stoid
"I will be MRS. CAPTAIN DUSOVER BELJAMBE," she murmured.
"JT7//youf" he returned, inquiringly.
Then a deep shade passed over his kind eyes, and his brown face
turned white, as a tender, troubled, look arose in his deep-set, cavern-
ous eyes.
"Come nearer, BELLA," he said, "and I will tell you the secret
of my life."
(To be continued.)
WHITE MATES IN ONE MOVE.
DAMS has been giving herself
up lately to the enjoyment
of sensational weddings.
The crowning interest has
been reached by the mar-
riage of MLLE. BLANC,
who was lately pushed
across by her father, the
celebrated proprietor of the
Monaco gaming-tables, to
the PRINCE RADZYVILL, one
of hismostconstantpatrons,
for better or worse—in
fact to turn out a prize or
a blank, as fortune may
determine. A few interest-
ing details of the ceremony
have not as yet been di-
vulged to the public.
Punch trusts he is not in-
discreet in publishing some
additional information. If
old BLANC be "Impair"
(tin pi're], as he has been
called by a punter now
sunk to a punster of the
most reckless description—
let us hope that bride and
bridegroom are destined to
be a happy pair, thougn sue is not yet twenty and he is between
(rente et quarante. The contrast of the bride's auburn tresses with
her lord's raven hair made more than one spectator compare them
to the rouge et noir of the paternal board of green cloth.
The lady certainly does not bring her bridegroom a zero as a
dowry. Though we may not admire the connection, prejudice is no
cause for not wishing that their married life may go comme sni-
des roulettes.
It is reported that when the bride arrived, pale with emotion, at
the altar, her affectionate father could not resist a last paternal cry
of " Jtouge perd et couleur." This not unnaturally called up a
flush on file cheek of the manly bridegroom, but he had the presence
of mind to cap the paternal allusion of BLANC Senior to his daugh-
ter's paleness with a smile and the half-audible retort—with refer-
ence at once to his own blush and the lady's dot—" Couleur gagne.'"

Historical Title for Government.
THE present Ministry should be historically remembered—though
when once out it will not be easy to re-" Member" it—as "The
Additional Administration." Their policy has not led them to a
Division, but to a continual Addition. Thus, inter alia, it has added
an hour to the daily period of Drinking: it has added the Suez
Canal to the list of English rivers: it has added the Vanguard to
the total of British wrecks: the Slave Circular to the number of
blunders: one penny to the Income-tax: and Empress to Queen.
That the Prime Mover of all this should take the ARCHBISHOP OF
CANTERBURY'S house at Aldington, is a suggestion which might be
acted on by a consistent politician who has also a respect for puns in
place.
as I originally wrote it. Was HOOAHTH a moral teacher or not f Was
KUJIENS a great colourist? Put HOQAUIH and RUHENS together on to a
report of the Admiralty Divorce and Probate Court? Me 'eomprtncz-vout,
man ami? Do I hold up DCSOVEB BELJAMBE as a faultless hero to be imi-
tated? or BELLA as a paragon of frigid respectability, or oyster-like flabby
virtue? Do I tell you or anyone to copy him or her? Do you expect a long
threnody? No."—R. D.
What the Editor saus.—" Dear Madam, don't be angry. We do not expect
a ' threnody'—but a tnree-volumey. You see tee are in a good temper. You
are begging the question. Read our letter again."—llu.
What the Authoress soys.—" Dear Sir, I in not angry. I do not see the
humour of your ' threnody' joke. If I • begged the question,' you begged ^tho
answer, ana now you 've got it. Haven't time for reading It-tiers—I write."—

WE read your wisdom here in Cathay, where we are
naturally interested in Asian Mysteries. Let me tell you of one in
my own family. My ancestor, ALADDIN, had an old lamp, by rub-
bing which he could, in a moment, summon to his service the
mightiest powers of earth and air to do his bidding, like the Jins at
the bidding of SOLOMON (on whom be peace!). But one day, when
ALADDIN was out, a venerable Hebrew merchant (he was in truth a
magician) appeared, offering new lamps in exchange for old ones;
and the court Ladies, and the snobs, sycophants, parasites, and
flunkeys about ALADDIN'S Princess-wife, BADEOOL-BADOOB, per-
suaded her to exchange her Husband's old lamp for the Jew's new
one, which looked so much bigger and brighter. But with the
lamp departed all those spirits of power; and the Princess, and her
palace, and her hall with twenty-four windows, from which she
looked on her domains in all quarters of the world, vanished away.
And now tidings come from your Land of the Setting Sun that your
QUEEN VICTORIA, who, for a thousand years, has worn a Crown more
wonderful than even the Lamp of ALADDIN or the Seal of SOLOMON,
for its power of calling men and Jins from the East and the West,
the North and the South, to do her service by sea and by land,
has been persuaded to listen to an old Hebrew magician, who has
offered her in exchange for that venerable talisman of sovereignty
a new one, made of what your goldsmiths who travel into these
regions tell us is of the metal called Brummagem, electro-gilded in
Parisian fashion upon German metal. Will not your QUEEN or her
advisers take warning before it is too late, that the new Crown has
none of the marvellous powers of the old one; and that VICTORIA
may find, as BADHOOL-BADOOB did, that he who offers her the dazzling
gawd is an Asian magician, whose powers lie among the unsubstan-
tial shows of the desert-mirage, rather than over the mighty if evil
majesty of the Jins and Afreets, or the more abject red spectres of
the nether world. Salaam aleikum.

SUB ROSA REFLECTION.
(A prupos of PALMEE'S Case. By a Prig.)

Of them Bobbies as g^ot in the slreet called Queer,
For hittin' a gent in the eye.

Words of Command.
CONCERNING certain suggestions for the Private Soldier's comfort,
"SEHO BED SERIO," in a letter to the Times, declares " comfort" an
"unsoldierlike word." The divine WILLIAMS, however, makes
Surdolph avouch " accommodated" to be " a soldierlike word, and
a word of exceeding good command," Anyhow " comfort" is a thing
as excellent, and a word as soldierlike as accommodation which
implies it. How can a soldier be said to be "accommodated" in
barracks, unless he is comfortable?
A Cabinet Question.
A PARTIAL Tax, now made more partial still,
A brand-new, lackered, Royal Titles Bill,
With mean alloy debasing England's Crown,
Bringing its pure gold to Mosaic down!
Bethink you whither these offences tend.
Are they not the beginning of your end?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE WHISKEY WAR.
HEN, a few clays
since, ME. O'SuL-
LIVAN rose in his
place in the House
of Commons to ask
for a Select Com-
mittee to "inquire
into the practice of
'blending' foreign
spirits in bond with
pure Irish Whis-
key," Mr. Punch
regrets to say that
the Third Estate of
the Realm was so
impregnated with
British prejudice
that the Committee
was refused. He
begs to supply the
omission. The following report (which has been furnished by
Mr. Punch's own dining-room table) may be relied upon as an
accurate account of what would have occurred had the prayer of
MR. O'SuLLiVAN been granted:—
First Meeting of the Irish Whiskey Committee.
Present—The MULLIGAN (in the Chair); The MAC SHOWN of Mac
Brown; SIR DOUGAL CREATURE (of that Ilk); The MACGILLI-
CUDDY of the Peat-Reeks.
The CHAIRMAN said it was entirely unnecessary to call any
witnesses. Sure couldn't they be their own witnesses? "Was there
not an elegant display of spirits on the table? They would test
those spirits for themselves. He was delighted to see his fellow
Committeemen. He begged to drink their very good healths, and
would commence the proceedings by proposing the toast of " •*"
go Bragh!"
The MAC BROWN of Mac Brown agreed with the Chairman in all
but his toast, which he considered offensive. They were duly quali-
fied to test and taste Whiskeys for themselves. To be in order,
then, he would propose that they should call up the Silent Spirit
of the Highlands at once. It was very good drinking.
The MACGILLICUDDY begged to move an amendment. He would
suggest the invocation of Pure Irish Whiskey in lieu of the Silent
Spirit of the Highlands. He begged to say that the Pure Irish
Whiskey was just the best drink in the whole world.
The CHAIRMAN proposed that both spirits should be tested. The
proposal was cordially received. After the empty bottles had been
removed,
SIR DOUSAL CREATURE (of that Ilk) was understood to say thai
something was " fery coot."
The MAC BKOWN of Mac Brown, as the Chieftain of a Clan, bugged
to ask his friend SIR DOUGAL CREATURE (of that Uk) whether his (Bra
DOUGAL'S) remark was intended to apply to the Silent Spirit of the
Highlands.
SIR DOUGAL CREATURE (of that Ilk) was understood to say thai
the Silent Spirit of the Highlands was "fery coot."
The MACGILLICUDDY asked with great warmth whether it was the
intention of SIR DOUGAL to reflect upon the Pure Irish Whiskey
He (the MACGILLICUDDY) was afraid of no man. He invited SIR
DOUGAL CREATURE (of that Hk) to tread upon the tail of his coat.
The MAC BROWN of Mac Brown here interposed, and the MACGILLI-
CUDDY consented to withdraw his invitation on the understanding
that SIR DOUGAL CREATURE should admit Pure Irish Whiskey to b
also "fery coot."
The CHAIRMAN remarked that talking was dry work. He nac
noticed that, during the last few minutes, several fresh bottles hai
been uncorked—he would therefore respectfully suggest that th(
spirit-testing should recommence. The suggestion was adoptee
with acclamation. After a pause,
The MACGILLICUDDY sang twenty-four verses of an Irish song-
assisted by SIR DOUGAL CREATURE (of that Ilk), who held his hanc
during the ceremony,—and declared his intention of adopting SIR
DOTOAL CREATURE'(of that Ilk) as a brother. He (the MACGILLI-
CUDDY) was afraid of no one. Did the Chairman doubt his word?
The MAC BROWN of Mac Brown interposed between the Chairman
and the MACGILLICUDDY, to give a detailed account of his own pedi
gree. The latter portion of his speech was nearly inaudible am
quite unintelligible.
The Chairman, at the conclusion of the speech of the MAC BROWN
of Mac Brown, to which he had listened with marked impatience
said that he held the MACGILLICUDDY in contempt. He was a spal
peen. For himself, he never felt better in his life. He had been
grossly insulted by the present company. He invited the presen
company to dine with him that day week, and bring any one the
leased. He would be proud to see them and their friends. "The
more the merrier." Alter repeating these words several times, first
milinglv and then frowningly, he suddenly disappeared.
The Committee then retired (under the table) to consider their
eport.
JENKINS v. JENKINS.
An Indignant Disavowal.
DEAR PUNCH,
You 've heard of me before:
Our race runs back to days of yore.
I 'm JENKINS, not the rude M.P.
For that unhappy town, Dundee—
So much I feel constrained to write,
For it would be too awful, quite,
To be confounded with that man—
But the more loyal JENKINS, who
Is proud to lick each Royal Shoe.
I quite approve DISRAELI'S plan.
Empress * I feel some inches bigger;
Though Rads may shout and Cads may snigger,
I shall be most supremely proud,
If I may only be allowed
To be the first who greets our QUEEN
By the new style, in newest sheen,
Which sheds o'n her effulgence bright,
And upon us a reflex light.
This opposition 's most vexatious.
How can M.P.'s be so ungracious?
I marvel at their cool effront'ry,
But every JENKINS in the country
(Save him, our loyal nock's black sheep
At whose defection I could weep)
Cries shame upon the tongue that sticks
At that sweet word, " Imperatrix."
Query the quantity—but Latin
Is not the language I 'm most pat in.
Is the " a" long or short ?—I falter—
If it's short, leave—if long, please alter.*
Let BENJAMIN on us depend,
For every JENKINS is his friend.
Who says the title's "purely local"?
Not so, while we have organs vocal,'
And pliant backs and callous knees;
Did Heaven bestow such gifts as these
To rust unused ?—The mild Hindoo
Must not monopolise Kotou!
Besides, 'twere very poor requital
To him who blest us with a title,
WThich puts us on a par with Prussia,
Makes France look bilious, frightens Russia,
To treat the Imperial style's effulgence
As all too bright for home-indulgence.
No, Mr. Punch. Too much'we prize it,
And will do more to naturalise it,
In spite of protests and petitions,
Than any number of editions
Of most prophetic schoolbooks. Do,
Drop down on Ginx's Buby, who
Must have the brass of fifty MENKENS.
Yours proudly,
THE ORIGINAL JENKINS.
* JENKINS is wrong; but does he think Punch is going to stoop to correct
his false quantities?
Parochial Progress.
A CONTEMPORARY announces a happy change about to be effected
in the—
"CONVERSION OF A CHUBCHYARD.—Yesterday morning Dn. TRISTRAM,
the Chancellor of the Diocese of London, granted the application by the REV.
HENRY JONES, the Rector of St. George's-in-the-East, and the Church-
wardens, for a faculty to convert a part of the churchyard into a flower-garden.
In the sanitary way, as well as the Esthetic, a great improvement
For the accomplishment of so tasteful and salubrious a proceeding as
the conversion of a churchyard into a flower-garden, it is gratifying
to see the faculties of parochial authorities enlarged.

JOHN TO JONATHAN.
THEY are in a "fix" in America; embarrassed by an unexpected
balance from the Geneva award, amounting to about nine million
dollars. Much discussion is going on about the appropriation of this
nice little sum. The Committee who have to deal with it are divided
in opinion, both the majority and minority proposing different schemes
for its disposition. The majority favour one set of claimants, the
minority another, as the lucky recipients of the balance. If Mr.
Punch is invited to act as arbiter, he is prepared to step in
between the two parties and cut the Gordian knot with his usual
unerring stroke. His proposition would be very simple and
practical. Remit the balance back to this country. The dollars
will arrive just in time to relieve the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER
from the painful duty of adding another penny to the Income-tax;
and we shall all, both Americans and English, meet at the
Cententiial Exhibition with increased satisfaction and the best
cousinly feeling.
Important to Divers.
AN announcement which may seem to concern philosophers and
poets is that of a newly-invented instrument, exhibited the other
evening at a conversazione of the Royal Society under the name of a
"bathometer." But that this is a contrivance for indicating, with-
out plummet, the depth of the sea, it might be imagined a device
for gauging either profundity of thought, as exemplified in the
speculations of some modern sages, or of imagination as manifested
by certain contemporary Bards, in divers plunges displaying their
proficiency in Bathos, or the art of sinking.
ROYAL TITLES.
'QUEEN of Great Britain" and " Empress'of Ind :"
Can these phrases accord with the popular mind?
An addition of titles we do not desire:
To the prefix of "Mr." we add not " Esquire."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A BRITTLE SEAL.
AsxcEnnOTALlST [Corre-
spondent, hailing 'from
near the London Docks,
denies that a "crucifix"
•was carried in procession
at a Ritualistic performance
nt Southampton, lately com-
mented on by Mr. Punch.
The description was copied
from a local paper. If'' cru-
cifix" should
have been
"cross"—What
%Val«, de-
nics that auri-
cular confession
is a practice
which, as a
practice, the
Establi sh ed
Church ignores.
In witness he
quotes one of
the Canons of
1603, relative
to it as an oc-
casional and
optional act,
and forbidding any Minister to reveal and make known "any
crime or offence 'committed to his trust and secresy (except they be
such crimes as by the laws of this realm his own life may be called
into question for concealing the same) under pain of irregularity."
Mark the exception—and mark the rule. What is there in either
to punish the disclosure of a confession, which is not a " crime" or
an " offence " in law, but only a " sin "? Talk of a clever lawyer
driving a coach-and-six through an Act of Parliament! "What
ecclesiastical advocate could not easily drive a railway-van through
such a Canon as that relied on by our sacerdotalist friend? And
what machinery is there to enforce that old Canon?
If there are in the laws of the Church by Law Established pre-
visions sufficient to regulate tho habitual practice of confession,
why did a number of Romanising Anglican divines, the other day,
memorialise the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY to make such pro-
visions—and in vain?
Let sacerdotalists ask any original sncerdos, of the order they ape,
what he thinks of the Canon of 1603, concerning confession, and
enjoining secresy—with exceptions. What kind of a seal is such a
"seal of confession"? So fragile, as to be very much less like a
seal than another thing with which Ritualists are wont to play at
Romanism—a wafer!

THE GIRL WHO BEES.
WK know the sylph on " Spillers;" now from rinks the fancy flees,
To the bun bleu of the period—the learned girl who " Bees."
She has WKH^TKR at her finger-ends, o'er WALKER walks with ease;
Can crack all the nuts in NITTTALL, this portentous girl who Bees.
She can spell "metempsychosis," knows how many /'s and c's
Should be put in "peccadillo "—this alarming girl who Bees.
"Phthisis" has for her no terrors; in " sciatica" she sees
Nothing to cause her trouble—she has had them both at Bees.
Never "harassed" or "embarrassed," she can spell you both of
these;
She can "braze " out MR. LOWE, can this ftabititt'e of Bees.
Even COTTON, ex-Lord Mayor, admits he can't afford to sneeze
At the fight where he encounters this triumphant Queen of Bees.
Blithely ever is she buzzing. Night by night, snow, blow, or freeze,
Gaily humming " I am coming," as she flits among the Bees.
Once she quailed at MR. D'ORSEY; now she puts the "e " in pease.
She "s as good as MR. CASSOWAN, that veteran of Bees.
She browbeats interrogators—" Just explain it, if you please."
"Would you kindly re-pronouncfi it?" says tnis champion of Bees.
She 's not lost, though she hesitates. She minds her (jf's and »'s,
"Slow and sure " 's the golden rule that guides the heroine of Bees.
Other girls do High-Art needlework, sing BACH or nigger glees,
But she her glamour casts by spells—the Queen of busy Bees.
Our banks are furnished with them. There is really quite a
squeeze
Of seraphic Curates hiving whole swarms of Ladies' Bees.
Male orthographers are cyphers: they please not, nor displease—
'Tis stilljthe befit who bears away the bell at all the Bees.
May she win a, prize from Hymen. Soon her fair face may we see
In a hive with blithe brood humming—Spelling changed for Baby
Bee.

Eastern Potentate. Your Royal Highness will see that we are
quite civilised. I speak English, and know how to order a dinner.
A propos, I trust the menu has given satisfaction?
Illustrious English Traveller. Nothing could have been better,
my dear Khedive. Oysters, soup, fish, entrees, game, everything
excellent. You must nave a cordon bleu in your kitchen.
Eastern Potentate (smiling). Well, I do not mind admitting that
I do pay a good round sum to my chef. It surprised poor CAVE,
and the man is worth the money. Even OITREY said he was quite
up to the Parisian mark. I am rather proud of my cellar. What
do vou think of that Chateau d'Yemeni?
Illustrious English Traveller. Excellent—simply excellent; and
your dry champagne would do honour to Marlborough House.
Now for coffee and chasse, and then the mild cigar (ictth a sigh of
anticipation).
Eastern Potentate (to Confidential Butler). You hear, BEN
SoLO>rox. Coffee, chasse, and cigars!
[Confidential Butler bows, and gives the necessari/ directions to
the other Servants. Exeunt the other Servants.
Illustrious English Traveller (regarding Confidential Butler
ivith some curiosity). Does that man come from England, your
Highness?
Eastern Potentate (confused). Well, not exactly—at least, if he
comes from England—he is of Eastern extraction.
Confidential Sutler (irith confidential ivhisper). Fact is, your Rile
'Ighncss, I 'm from Cursitor Street.

you kindly desire this person to retire?

(Scene closes in.)
Going too Far.
Dm M. JOHN LEMOINNE, in his last Article in the Debats_ on the
Royal Titles Bill, really speak of the QrEEN as " the Sovereign of a
great country, which desired nothing better than to respect her,
almost to embalm her"? If he did, Mr. Punch must set him right
! on one point. This is a great country, and it desires nothing better
than to respect its Sovereign; but it certainly has not the slightest
wish to embalm her—that being a process which M. Lr.MorNjfE must
know requires life to be terminated before it can be performed, and
the termination of HER MAJESTY'S life is the last thing this country
would desire.
An "Alias" Improved.
THY Sovereign dub an Empress, BEN? What for?
A countercheck to Russia's Emperor?
Rather, my BENJAMIN, wouldst make the QTTEEN a
Match for the CZAB, entitle her " Czarina."

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EY for the Holidays!
Monday, April 10 (Com-
mons).—" How does a Naval
Captain decline to receive an
Admiralty reprimand?"
SIB ROBERT PEEL has been
much exercised by this knotty
problem, since the World
announced that CAPTAIN WELCH had ventured on
what DANTE would have called this "Gran
rifiuto."
MB. WABD HUNT declared that there was no
authority for this strange piece of news, except
the World, which he described as a " quasi-comic"
paper. We have SHAKSPEABE'S authority that" all
the World's a stage," but we have yet to learn
that the staple of its performances is comic, or even
"quasi-comic," whatever that may mean. But
the World's announcement may well have per-
plexed graver heads than SIB ROBERT PEEL'S. A
man may decline to receive a present, but hardly
a slap in the face or a kick on the opposite ex-
tremity of his person. That sort of thing is not usually preceded by the opportunity
of such an option as includes the possibility of refusal. A cuff or kick may be returned,
but scarcely refused. For a Naval Captain to decline receiving an Admiralty repri-
mand, would seem to be very like reprimanding the Admiralty: and that, as MB.
WABD HUNT explained, would " in a Captain" be the "flat blasphemy" called
insubordination. A Captain, reprimanded, may ask for a court-martial.
"Had CAPTAIN WELCH asked for a court-martial?" asked SIB ROBERT.
"No," said MB. WABD HUNT.
A few minutes after, MB. ANDEBSON said he had in his pocket a note written by
CAPTAIN WELCH to him, stating that he had asked for a court-martial.
MB. WABD HUNT declared that no such letter had "reached the Admiralty."
Now "Admiralty" is an "amphibologous" term. It means a Building, and it
means a Board. It may have "reached" the one, but not yet got as far as the other.
At any rate, the contradiction should be explained. It does not look pretty as it
stands.
MB. FAWCETT gave notice that on the first day after the Easter recess he will ask
MB. DISRAELI whether he will give him a day for discussion of the Address to the
Crown, before the issue of the Proclamation under the Royal Titles Bill.
Her Majesty's faithful Commons have a Constitutional right to audience of HEE
MAJESTY. Punch hopes MB. DISBAELI will not refuse such audience, even to the
so-called Minority which wishes to put on record its final protest against the
Brummagem title of " Empress." But there is still a fortnight, at least, between us
and the Proclamation. Between the Proclamation and the assumption of a title
which every day is becoming more and more unacceptable to the sound sense and
educated opinion of Great Britain there is the still larger interval filled by HUB
MAJESTY'S excellent judgment and trained experience of the strength of feeling that
couples Loyalty and Liberty in the hearts of her subjects.
Then MR. ANDEBSON opened his battery of heavy guns against the conduct of
Government as regards the collision of the Alberta and the Mistletoe.
The Andersoman artillery took a wide range—blazing away at everybody
concerned in the unfortunate accident—the PBINCE OF LEININOEN, CAPTAIN WELCH,
GENEBAL PONSONBY (the indiscreet letter-writer to the MABQUIS OF EXETEB), the
Coroner, Foreman, and most members of the first Jury, BABON BBAMWELL, the
ADMIRALTY, and, finally, MB. HEYWOOD, who had had the audacity to declare himself
satisfied.
TOL. LXX. Q
In short, it is clear to ME. ANDEBSON that some-
body ought to have suffered, besides CAPTAIN
WELCH who has been reprimanded, and JOHN
BULL who has had to pay the compensations.
It would be impossible for the most hard-
mouthed patriot that ever " heckled" a Minister
on a case affording a grand opening for cheap
clap-trap, to have discharged the duty more dis-
agreeably, or with more apparent relish, than the
rasping Member for Glasgow. And it would be
impossible for any Minister, directly and offen-
sively attacked, to have received the fire of his
bitter and boisterous assailant more meekly, and to
havereturneditmorefeeblv, than MB. WABD HUNT.
Of course, the Admiralty have bungled. It
is their way. But the Queen's yacht will not in
future run at fifteen knots an hour through the
Solent, or any other waters where small sailing
craft he thick, and ply frequent. Let JOHN BULL
put that in his pipe, and smoke it, as his returns
from all that has been done, and left undone,
said, and left unsaid, in the unfortunate case of
the Alberta and Mistletoe. As for ME. HEYWOOD,
who is base enough to be satisfied, and mean-
spirited enough to hope that "bye-gones will
be bye-gones, we leave him to the scorn of MR.
ANDEBSON.
MB. 8. LLOYD did a good work in calling
attention to the grievances of the Marines—
those step-children of the services, whose high
pride it is always to do their duty, and whose hard
fate it is always to fall between the two stools of
the Army and Navy, to both of which, and yet
neither of which, they seem to belong, if we may
judge by the proportion of kicks to halfpence in
their allowance.
Everybody who spoke admitted the grievances
of this gallant corps; and MB. A. EGERXON, for
the Admiralty, declared that the Board was most
anxious to put both promotion and retirement in
the Marines on a more satisfactory footing, but did
not like to apply a merely temporary remedy.
Let them only make the remedy as long-lived as
the grievance has been, and 'twill serve.
Then the House went into Committee on Naval
Estimates, and MB. SHAW LEFEVRE showed the
usual zeal of ex-Officials of the Admiralty in
calling attention to desertions in the Navy, the
difficulties connected with the training of boys for
the Navy, and the urgency of establishing links
between the Navy and the Merchant Service.
MB. WABD HUNT was as grateful for MB. SHAW
LEFEVBE'S suggestions as obliged Officials always
are to obliging ex-Officials, and pointed out all
the difficulties in the way of improvement in the
usual cheerful official style.
It is remarkable how much cleverer your ex-
Official usually is in seeing and stating difficulties
than your Official in removing them.
Tuesday (Morning Sitting).—Notices of Motion
for after-Easter sittings—pos^-Pasehal eggs, with
more or less prospect of hatching.
But SIB STAFFOBD NOBTHCOTE decidedly de-
clined to be dragged into the Suez Canal by SIB
H. D. WOLFF. Then St. Stephen's School broke
up for the Easter holidays, MB. DISBAELI giving
notice to his young friends that the business of the
School would recommence on Monday, April 24.
We leave boys, Ushers, and Headmaster to their
holiday tasks and amusements, with the wish that
the coming two-thirds of the Session may be more
prolific of good work than the first third has been!
For one who claims such exceptional powers of
education as the present Head of the School,
Punch cannot say that he will carry dpwn_ to
Hughenden the crop of laurels and testimonials
which had probably been anticipated by his
admirers.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

BIRDS FOR THE BONNET.
H, Mr DEAREST PUNCH.
%Do pray hold up
to ridicule as severely as
ever you can the stupid
satirical remarks on a
pretty fashion, which I
copy from a newspaper
that copies them out of
La ml «,i,l Wate)—a man's
paper I never see, where
they appear as an extract
. from a letter pretended to
be written by a Lady in
Westmoreland, Jamaica,
"in deprecation of the
cruel fashion of destroying
the humming-bird for the
sake of decorating Ladies'
hats." Speaking of some
flowering trees frequented
by those birds which look
so pretty in the hair, the
writer says:—
"I see the humming-birds
darting about the branches
like sparks of emerald and
crimson fire; but unfortunately their number is being rapidly reduced by
the womankind of England, who will decorate their silly heads with the
lovely little bodies which ought never to be seen except on the wing."
Oh, as if any Lady would ever think of calling her own sex woman-
kind, and talking about their silly little heads.' Of course these are
the expressions of some horrid man; but what follows is beyond
anything:—
"Unfortunately, too, such is the course of fashion, the Negro women here
are adopting the same mode, and I fear there is not much doubt that the
humming-bird will Boon be exterminated. It is, indeed, a shame to destroy
these little beauties in the ruthless manner they are being destroyed at the
present time."
The Near* women, indeed! 'As much as to say of course that our
fashion 01 trimming- our hats with humming-birds is one which
their adopting it proves to be peculiarly adapted to a barbarous and
savage taste, which I call a most shamefiu sneer and only wonder
the wretch did not accuse vt of having adopted the fashion from
then. And, as to ruthless, I should like to know what can be more
so than each nonsense as the above.
If they want to stop the destruction of humming-birds, there are
plenty ready killed and stuffed in that fusty old place the British
Museum, where they are of no use, but only to look at, and a great
many more than enough, and other birds besides, of the most
brilliant colours equally becoming and all well adapted foT ornaments
to a head-dress, and do pray dear Punch exert your great influence
with Parliament or whoever it is to order all that are not absolutely
wanted to be disposed of for that purpose, and then as a fashion
soon changes unless when it is found fault with and abused, and
made fun of and caricatured, there would most likely be quite a
sufficient supply of humming-birds and others in use for hat and
head-dress trimmings to last as long as they are wanted and dispense
with the necessity ot.going on killing any more.
Ever yours affectionately and devotedly attached,
ANGELINA.
P.S.—Better have humming-birds than bees in your bonnet.
GONE WRONG!
A NEW NOVEL. BY. MISS RHODT DENDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh Down lilce a Shower," "Bed in the Nose is She,"
"Good/ Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, But don't Tell."
CHAPTER VII.— What the Author says.
D08OVEH BELJAHBE stretched out a strong, gentle arm, and pulled
her tenderly towards him. The moon steals up quietly, inaudibly,
and, looking down with its own sweet, shy, silent, askant yet
benignant gaze on the lovers, dashes some of her night light on nis
grand, recumbent form and dark, hairy face, forming a sombre
ground against her pale, smooth one.
Let no one think that I am holding this pair up for imitation.
My opinion is that DUSOVEH is an unmitigated scoundrel, and
BELLA, to say the least of it, a Slyboots. I warn my readers against
falling in love with either of them, though I confess I do write this
sort of character con amore, and I admit that it is not a labour of
love for me to be obliged to introduce such a namby-pamby, wishy-
washy milksop—excellent moral character though he be—as the REV.
THOMAS HASSOCK. If we cannot all be saints, we can all be sinners;
if we cannot all be strong, and, what the world calls, vicious, let us be
weak, and, what the world calls, virtuous. Am I all my fancy paints
others? Am I all that the fancy of others paints me? Do I recom-
mend you all to be DUSOVER BELJAMBES and BELLA ST. JOHN
VILLIARSES? Not I. If I write their characters so well, and
give novel-reading young ladies and gentlemen such graphic and
alluring descriptions of probable, but questionable, situations, as fire
your uninventiye imaginations, do I thereby offer them a temptation
to rush off and imitate my heroes and heroines? If I tell you that
DFSOVEE, in kissing and hugging little BELLA, and BELLA, in
allowing herself to be kissed and hugged, were utterly and entirely
in the wrong, that such conduct, though represented as irresistibly
nice, was intrinsically naughty, am I not a Great Moral Teacher?
And are not such great moral teachers always listened to with the
deepest attention f Am I not, in fact, the great moral benefactor
of the present generation? Certainly. Then, Liberavi animam
meam, and, on we go again, worse than ever.*
"Perhaps," said DOSOVER, painfully gnawing his heavy black
moustache, and looking up searchingly under her green eyes; "when
I have told you what I have to tell you—the secret of my life—you
will never speak to me again."
She threw her white arms round his neok, and stroked his hairy
face.
"DtrsovER," she said, steady and distinct, "if I were to have my
head cut off this moment without knowing anything about it, I
would not move for your sake."
He gazed on her with his dark, luminous eyes, that seemed aflame
with demoniac tenderness in their cavernous ghostly depths. Then,
in his deep, bell-like tone he spoke .
"You have noticed my rough-hewn massive features?'
She had; she could not deny it, had she indeed wished to do so.
She had scanned his features as often as she had scanned his poetic
spondeaan feet, and so she answered, as in a happy, baleful trance,
Yes, my own, old, wicked, darling DUSOVEB! I have!"
He caught her to him, and held her as a strong man on the
edge of a precipice might grip a lamp-post that kept him from
destruction. Craning his long, sinewy neck over her head, he took
one deep, exhausting draught from his great, big, imperial-quarto-
brandy Husk.
Then his voice came, sounding unsteady, and thick,
"You have observed my great thick moustache?"
"Yes," she answered, with wondrous soothinguess.
"You have not forgotten when^you first saw mo standing before
the hotel door at Wollum?"
"Forgotten you!" she exclaimed. "Were it as many years, as it
is minutes ago, that I first saw you, I should not have forgotten the
moment when vou were in your neat, gentlemanly dress, your
knickerbockers displaying those two full-rounded calves'
DUSOVEH BELJAMBE stopped her almost savagely.
"Hush!" he said, as his penthouse brows drew together savagely,
and he bit his lips morosely. "Tell me, has any one dared to
breathe a word against me behind my back?"
"Not a soul," answered BELLA, with a pretty, dimpling laugh,
and closing her eyes so as to give DtmovEE scope to gloat over those
fringed wonders, while she, nervously, intertwined her pale, pink,
warm fingers.
DUSOVEB gave a great sigh of relief.
"You must know all," he said, pulling at his grand qnarto-nask,
under his big; dropping moustache.
"I am not inquisitive," answered BELLA, coldly; "but go ahead,
dear boy, and tell me everything about yourself. t
Their faces are close together, and she can see the wild, honest
anxiety looking through those open windows.
"You have noticed mv magnificent, big shoulders?"
"Yes."
"You have observed my tawny, brownThair, and lion-coloured
beard?"
"Yes," answered BELLA, looking up wistfullv into that haughty
faee,and those wicked, miserable eyes. "Yes/1
"Would you like to see me without these appendages?"
BELLA raised her chestnut-shaped head,'and slightly shrinking, as
if from a great loathing, said brokenly, "Go on. Don't mind me."
He nerved himself to the task, for task it was to him.
* By the Editing Committee.—It is with pleasure that we print the above
brilliant apology by the distinguished Authoress, inserted at oar request. We
were quite sure she meant no harm, and we only wanted her to be explicit
upon that point. Our Maiden Aunt wishes to record that, in her opinion, the
apology was not in any way necessary, and is entirely useless. She is in the
minority.—ED.
t What the Editor sayi.—" Dear Madam, do young Ladies talk like this?
'Go ahead,' &c. We can't believe it."—ED.
What the Authoress says.—"Mine do. I don't follow a fashion, I lead.
Am I writing this Novel, or are you ?"—R. D.

'TRYING."
Happy Swain (she has "named the day "). "AND xow, DEAREST EDITH, THAT
18 ALL SETTLED. WITH REGARD TO JEWELLERY, MY LOVE; WOULD YOU LIKE A
SET IN PLAIN GOLD, OR"
Edith (economical and courageous, andwho suffers a good deal/ram toothache). "On,
AUGUSTUS, NOW YOU ASK ME—DO YOU KNOW—I—REALLY—BUT—MK. CLINCH TOLD
ME YESTERDAY THAT HE COULD EXTRACT ALL I HAVE, AND PUT IN A BEAUTIFUL
NEW SET FOR ONLY FIFTEEN GUINEAS!!"
"When I were"—he said—" I mean—when I wore uniform"
"In the service?" she asked, eagerly.
"Yes," he replied, hesitatingly, yet with impassioned mournfulness, "when
I was—in—in service"—she winced, and he continued, clasping her still more
convulsively to his great, magnificent, broad chest, and repeating the words
distinctly, and deliberately, as though he were stabbing himself, with each word,
as with a dagger—"when I was in service—I wore no beard"
"It is not permitted in the Army," she interrupted, with a secret misgiving,
at her heart, of some great overpowering evil, vet to come upon her.
"Who said 'the Army' ?" he exclaimed, fiercely. Then he resumed, with
a despairing tenderness, that sent a thrill through her whole body down into her
very sole—" No, the service in which I was enlisted did not permit either
beard, or moustache; it was necessary to be close shaven."
Her last hope was vanishing fast.
"But," she murmured, "you have smelt powder?"
"Yes." answered DUSOVEB. calmly, with a very dreary laugh, that the heart
denied all partnership in, as his full lips curved downwards under his heavy,
sunset-dyed moustache. "Yes, I have smelt powder, BELLA."
"Thank Heaven for that!"
"And," he went on. holding her arms, and turning full on to her his own
lustrous orbs, in which the fiery light was flashing and dancing, full on to her
odd big green eyes, thinly curtained by her bright sweeping lashes, "/ have
worn it."
"At Court?" she gasped, her veins throbbing.
"Aye, at Court!" said the rich voice, shaking and quivering under some
strong agitation.
"Before the Queen?"
"No; behind the Queen—on the footboard of the royal carriage."
He seized her hands, detaining her with a grip of iron, and hurried on in a
hoarse, broken voice, "Just now you spoke of knickerbockers—of calves." He
paused, as though contending with a whirlwind of passionate agitation, and con-
flicting emotions. Then, rinding himself uninterrupted.!] e went on, with
reckless, despairing candour, "They were my fortune. Would Heaven they
had never been! I was on the footboard behind—and
she—a lady of title—no matter who—sat in the carriage
following Aus—I mean us." She sent me a billy doo. I
was fool enough to accept the tempting bait, and I
Aassumed—I mean nssumed—the name of DUSOVEE
BELJAUBE at 'er request—I mean at her request."
"Her."' she exclaimed, lighting up an eager and
mobile face. "Was she beautiful?"
This is always a woman's first question.
"No."
And this is always the man's answer to it.
BKLLA sighed happily, and her heaving breast rose,
and fell, in short quick undulations.
- "She was rich—hawful rich—and squinted frightful.
But I was vain and poor-^-and—and—I changed my
name in order that she might change hers. I went
secretly to a night-school to complete my heddication"
—he stammered slightly, and his swart face was suffused
with that dark, bnck-dust flush, that stood to bim in-
stead of a blush, as he corrected his slip—" I mean my
'education.' And then, she bought me a rank in the
Marine Yeomanry Contingent; and then—I called myself
C'APTATlf DUSOVER BELJAMBE."
"And," asks BELLA, breathlessly, her great eyes* green
as goose-berries, fastened on his face, "before that—you
were—I mean your name was"
He looks grimly down into her upturned glowing face,
and answers with a death-like calmness, "I teas—JOHX
TIJMMUS JEAMES—the JEAMES of Bukley Square."
He watched her changing, flushing, paling face.
"Have you told me all?" she asked, almost inaudibly.
"Nearly," answered DUSOVEE BELJAMBK, smiling as
bitterly as though he had taken a deep, unwholesome
draught of sun-turned, thunder-struck, hop-ful bever-
age. "We were—married!"
Silence—such a silence! how many vears of agony
were pent up in those few pulse-beats '•! We shall never
know, we shall never learn the answer; had BELLA been
asked at this moment, she would have given it up, des-
pairingly.
"Married!" she echoed, in a dry, unnatural voice,
that jarred on his ear as though it had issued from the
metallic mouthpiece of an itinerant Punch showman.
"Is i/irt< all?"
"No," he went on, with a gall-bitter sneer, which,
lasting as it did for several minutes, was more painful to
sustain than any tears or sneezing—indeed sneezing
would have been a glad relief—"I had deceived her. I
had obtained .her hand under false pretences. She had
taken me for my magnificent figure, for my gigantic,
Ainormous Aand—I mean mormous, and—unequalled,
calves. A huge hair-pin, thrust in forcibly when I warn't
looking, and causing me not the slightest Aemotion —
emotion—betrayed my secret. My art failed me"
"Your Aeart or your art?" inquired BKLLA, bent on
sparing herself no single aspirate.
"Art, not Aeart," answered DUSOVEB, emphatically.
"My Aeart could have proved true, but my art had
played me false. My calves, like the poetry of a maga-
zine, were mere padding."
A spasm of pain crossed his face.
"Aren't you well?" she inquired, anxiously.
He made no reply, but forcibly clenching his hands,
threw himself wildly on the ground, rolled over three
times in his utter, hopeless, despairing, writhing misery,
then turned his face to the cliff, and;groaned.
(To In continued.)
Doctrine and Drink.
IN announcing the decease of a late priest, the Times
observes that—
"His death was the natural termination of a long illness,
brought on by too close an attention to theological studies."
Theology is like wine, beer, and spirits, oalumniously
called intoxicating liquors, because they do not intoxi-
cate unless they are abused or taken in excess; but
then they do, and their continued abuse may end in
delirium tremens. Theology too closely and deeply
studied may prove, for the student excessively addicted
to it, like brandy-and-water—too much of a good thing.

CAUSE AND EFFECT.
THE Grand National Hunt seem to have had rare SBort at their
meeting at Bogside (Ayrshire), last week. It is interesting to learn,
from the report in theScotsman, that—" The object of the Hunt is
the encouragement of the breeding, rearing, and schooling of first-
class hunters." And this is how it's done:—
"THE EOLINTON HANDICAP of 12 SOTS, each, with 200 BOYS., &c. . . There
was no change till the plough near the bottom turn, where Solon dropped
down dead, and Zero, heading Farley, came on and won in a canter by twenty
lengths.
"THK ADAMHILL CUP, value 70 SOTS., &c. . . . Student made play, fol-
lowed by Vagrant, which at the first hurdle came to grief, and threw CAPTAIN
MIDDLETON, who had his shoulder dislocated.
"THE GRAND NATIONAL OPEN FARMERS' PLATE of 75 sovs. . . . After
clearing the last hurdle, Percy staggered and fell dead, and Gamekeeper
finished a bad third."
From which it would appear that the educational curriculum of
the hunters is comprehensive enough to embrace within its limits
anything "from pitch and toss to manslaughter."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HOMELESS HUSBANDS.

BT us thank a benevolent
philanthropist, who pro-
poses to set on foot an
institution for the relief of
British Husbands, whom
the advent of a babv or
the arrival of a mother-
in-law has exiled for a
season from the comforts
of a home.
As many a married man
becomes by sad experi-
ence painfully aware,
home ceases to be home
to him when once a baby
enters it. Nor in six
cases out of seven can he
call his house his own
when he has placed it, s
to speak, at the mere
of his mother - in - law
While the latter potentat
is cosily installed ther
he runs a daily risk o
being snubbed by his own
servants, and often hall
starved at his meals. Fo
a time he is deposed, an
must retire into exile
j-i^- tm i • must retire into exile
and Kin* Baby is proclaimed, with Grandmamma for Regent, an
Monthly Nurse as Prime Minister, First Lord of the Treasury, an
Ministerial interim, in'all.the other departments.
At such a time poor husbands, being destitute of all the comfort
of a home, are specially in need of shelter and relief. It is propose(
therefore to founda;Home for their reception, where in cases o
emergency they may be admitted, without thereby incurring th
stigma which might cling to them, if they ventured upon seekini
entertainment'at a Club.
For such of them as have no occupation to divert them in the day
the solace of a reading-room will doubtless be provided: and for thi
general welfare a good plain wholesome dinner will be served a
seven o clock, as a cheerful substitution for a solitary meal In
order to prevent undue conviviality, a pint of sherry, hook, or claret
will be allowed to each guest: nor will this small quantity ever bi
exceeded, except in the case of invalids provided with a medica
certificate, signed by two physicians and a justice of the peace
Alter this, some quiet sober games, such as spillikins, or draughts
or chess, or possibly long whist, maybe permitted for an'hour or
two; a special prohibition being placed, perhaps, on billiards, as
savouring too much of the attractions of a Club. One cigar may be
allowed each poor husband while sitting in the play room, and
another may be doled out to light him going home; but only on
condition of his thoroughly removing all traces of it from his clothes
hair, &o., before he goes to bed.
In accordance with the growing fashion of the day, a rink will be
attached by way of outhouse to the Home—being provided as a
means of healthy daily exercise for husbands who are used to
pastimes such as hunting, which, if they live in London, can only be
indulged in at some distance from their residence. Such pleasures
they are bound to abandon for a while, in order to pay proper
devotion to their family, and especially the little stranger lately
welcomed into it. A Kink for Homeless Husbands will doubtless be
esteemed of national importance, and a company will probably be
started betore long to supply what is so clearly a requirement of
the age.
RINKOMANIACS.
THE following cases of this very painful malady are reported from
.Brighton, London, and elsewhere :—
The Persevering Curate.—Skates in blue spectacles and a suit of
lerical black. Progresses slowly and meekly. Will carry in his
right hand (if permitted so to do) a silk umbrella. Tendency to
indulge in mild flirtations with "not pretty but nice" girls of a
certain or rather uncertain age.
The Defiant Mamma.—A matron of sixty, who tries vainly to
look forty. Progresses slowly, but with much show of stern deter-
mination. Tendency to embonpoint, and extreme caution.
The Would-be Siren.—A. playful but anxious coquette, painfully
attempting to stand upon wheels. Unaccustomed as she is to public
(or any) skating, she moves with great difficulty. She is very
anxious to avail herself of male assistance. Arch, but nervous,
-tendency to fall ungracefully.
The Accomplished Cad.—Can manage the outside edge. Knows
how to skate « la teapot." Is accustomed to progressing at the
rate of sixteen miles an hour. Thinks it " funf> to upset children
and defenceless females. Tendency to receive chastisement from
lathers, brothers, and husbands without asking for redress
TU- i J?,?r,i"g Boardin9-School Miss.—Skates well, but bashfully.
1 hinks Kinking )h TO nice:" and seeks assistance from her cousins
and their friends. Tendency to get engaged " well—not wisely."
The Youthful-Mtnded Matron.—Skates slowly, but with much
finish. Fond of smiling amiably. Likes to go round with her
youngest daughter (aged sixteen—dressed ten), in the hope that
beholders may believe that her hair is real, her complexion is
genuine, and that she has never purchased her teeth from the
dentist. Tendency to look absurd.
The Awkward Adonis.— Skates with ease, but without grace,
beems to have very prominent arms and legs. Tendency to conjure
up visions of the comic singers at the music-halls in their less
successful "creations."
Mr. Punch.—No, that at least is a calumny; for, spite of the
fashion, this clever gentleman is not a Rinkomaniao—yet!
EASTER EGGS A-HATCHING, OE AN-ADDLINQ.
WHAT are we all doing this Easter? Mr. Punch will hazard a
tew conjectures.
The Prime Minister is settling in his own mind the ceremonial
details ot the coronation of Her Imperial Majesty, the EMPRESS or
ITTDIA, at Delhi, on the banks of the Jumna, the next cool season
He is also understood to be preparing another surprise for Parliament
the People, and the Press; but whether he intends still further to
enlarge the Peerage, or level the mounds on the borders of the
berpentine, or augment the salaries of the Civil Service, or trans-
port CLEOPATRA'S Needle from the Nile to Northumberland Avenue
or negotiate a Loan with MESSRS. ROTHSCHILD for the immediate
construction of the Sub-Channel Tunnel; between England and
prance, is shrouded in that impenetrable future lying beyond the
faster recess from which Time alone can withdraw the mystic
veil.
The Keepers at the Zoological Gardens are speculating as to the
habits, tempers, and dispositions of the various Beasts and Birds
now on their way from Hindostan to an honourable captivity in the
Regent s Park, and wondering what effect the Royal Titles Bill will
have on the Tigers.
The Lord Mayor and Sheriffs are wondering whether they will
be baronetted and knighted on the occasion of the Visit of the
PRINCE OF WALES to the City after his return from India.
Sundry Mayors and Corporations, with the aid of their Town
Clerks, are pondering the terms of the Addresses to be presented to
His Royal Highness when he sets foot once more on his native
shores.
The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER is wondering whether the
Americans would remit him the unexpected balance of the Geneva
award. (Doesn't he wish he may get it ?)
The Talookdars of Oude are meditating a visit to London, to
testify their joy at the fulfilment of their passionate longing to have
an limpress to rule over them. When they come, they will be pre-
sented at a levee, see some fireworks (weather permitting) and
•\ttend one or more of the great May charity dinners.
MESSRS. BLACK, BROWN, GRAY, GREEN, PINK, and WHITE are
wondering whether their landscapes, seascapes, portraits, historical
subjects, and touching little domestic pieces, have been accepted by
.he Royal Academy.
Thousands of excellent persons are longingfor the arrival of the
month of May that they may troop to Exeter Hall and other uneom-
modious buildings, to hear most interesting statements of the
operations during the past year of the Society for the Amelioration
t it6 V12?511"0111 of NaPle8> al>d listen to stirring appeals in support
rf?e A-ntl-G'T.e&0rian Chants and Vestments League.
Those peculiar people who spend their lives in the pursuit of
ileasure and the cultivation ot, amusement are hoping some new
liversion will be devised for them this season.
Some dear children at Sandringham are wondering what presents
papa will bring them from India.
Weather is the cause of many anxious thoughts and specula-
ions. I he betting was in favour of Hyems against Vertumnus.
But it has changed within the last few days, almost as suddenly and
s decidedly as the betting on the Boat Race.
RITUALISTIC NOVELTY FOE EASTER.
SERMON with full Orchestral Accompaniment" is the last new
ling out at Folkestone. We congratulate the Reverend Caterer for
ublic Amusement on his happy thought, and trust his lungs will
rove as powerful as his brass.

DROPPING IN TO TEA AT A GIPSY PARTY.
CRITICISM AND DEFAMATION.
THE Annual Dinner of the Shopkeepers' Mutual Protection Society, consisting largely of
retail dealers resident in South London, took place yesterday at the Hole-in-the-Wall.
The usual facetious and business toasts and sentiments having been drunk by the
assembly.
The Chairman (MR. SUNDRIES, Grocer) said he had now a toast to propose which he was
sure they would all drink enthusiastic. They were all on them aware 'ow important it was
for a tradesman halways for to bear a good name. That required a stringent lawr for to
protect 'is goods from bein' blowed upon, and a upright Judge for to enforce the lawr.
Bitch a lawr was the lawr as lately laid down by the LORD CHIEF^JUSTICE; and the LORD
CHIEF JUSTICE'
HERITAGE
a man who _..,..
to tell another man that to the lawyer's discredit. Now, they mightn't think that concerned
them much, but it did. What was lawr for solicitors was lawr for shopkeepers, too; sauce
for goose, sauce for gander. Besides, his Ixirdship^the Times said—went on to say that
"a man is not free to go about the world complaining of the incapacity of a workman
whom he has employed, nor may he volunteer a complaint to a friend who has recommended

him." No more right, in course, 'adn't a
customer to go about oomplainin' of the
dishonesty of a tradesman for avin' supplied
'im with a inferior article. That would be
slander, and liable to 'eavy damages—least-
ways unless he oould prove his words.
Now he (MR. SUNDRIES) would dare anybody
to go findin' fault with his tea, coffee,
mustard, or anythink else 'e sold. The
toast he had to propose was the Lawr of
Defamation and Libel, with which he would
couple the name of the LORD CHTEF JUSTICE
OF HENGLAWD. (Cheert.)
MR. SNITKINS, Tailor, was glad to hear
that clients would 'ave to keep cautious
tongues in their 'eads; and take care in
future 'ow they complained of misfits.
MR. VAMT, Bootmaker, would say them
was his sentiments too.
MR. WATERS. Dairyman, said his milk
had been a good deal cried down for bein'
poor. Grumblers had better mind now—
without they took care to 'ave the milk
tested.
MR. RUBBLE, Builder, would defy any
one to say as how he scamped his work.
So would MR. PUTTY, Painter, Plumber
and Glazier, and House Decorator.
MR. VINNET, Cheesemonger, arter wot
he had now 'eerd, would dare his cus-
tomers, any on 'em, to say as his Stilton
warn't the cheese.
MR. FRIBBINS, Linendraper, would let
people know, if ever he found 'em out
sayin' his calicoes wouldn't wash. He
would likej however, to know to what ex-
tent criticism was in law libellous. He
had superior connections. One of them
was a nauthor. He wrote for his bread.
The newspapers cut up his books. Wasn't
that as bad as runnin down a lawyer, or a
workman, or a shopkeeper? (" Oh, oh.'")
He would appeal to the Chairman. What
was the difference between criticising a
pound of tea and criticising a novel?
(Groans and hisses.)
The Chairman would only say it was
quite different.
MR. FRIBBINS. — How about a hartis
whose pictures is called daubs? Some
hartises is said to be pot-unters. Their
picters is called pot-bilers. True enough.
Their picters is their bread. Couldn't
their unfavourable critics, accordin' to the
LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, be sued for spiliii'
their market? (Uproar.)
MR. BUNG, Publican.—But how if so be
they be sign-painters? (Cries of" That'«
another thing altogether ! ")
MR. BUNG wasn't so sure of that.
The Chairman was sartin His Lordship
never meant to talk ridiculous. Besides,
no British Jury would never consider
hauthors and hartises in the same light
with the British Tradesman. So now he
would give, "The Law of Libel and De-
famation, No Privileged Communication,
and the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE! Upstand-
ing, uncovered, with three times three!"
The toast was drunk amid cries of "The
LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, 'is jolly good "ealth,"
followed by the chorus, For he 's a jolly
good fellow, and so say all of us!" Pipes
and tobacco were then introduced, and the
Society settled down to enjoy their evening.
Per Contra.
MR. PUNCH is pleased to observe that
"Homes for Smack Boys "are to be es-
tablished at Yarmouth and elsewhere.
Smacks for home boys having been so
long in force throughout the United King-
dom, it seems only right that something
should be done on the other hand.

had previously made to M. JOSEPH GAH-

covered in Spain of such marvellous rich-
ness that they might contribute to restore
the normal relative value — 151 to 1 —
between the two metals ; " to wit, gold anc
silver. M. MANNEQUIN added that a Com-
pany was now being formed to work the
gold-field whose richness he thus described
The foregoing intelligence seems a grea!
deal too good to cheer even the most san-
guine of , Spain's creditors. Few of them
probably will expect the Spanish gold-
mines, of which M. MANNEQUIN has an-
nounced the discovery,to turn out anymore
substantial than the celebrated " Castles'
peculiar to Spain. By the bye, does no1
Mannequin in French mean what in Eng-
land is called a dummy or lay-figure?
This is surely a suspicious source for such
startling information.

DEATH IN .THE DOSE.
A NOTABLE case of what a great living poet calls " pestling a
poisoned poison" came to light the other day before a Police
Magistrate. The Times reports that—
"Ax GREENWICH, MART KIUHV, chemist, of Trafalgar Road, Greenwich,
was summoned for an offence under the Adulteration Act. The Officer stated
that on the 8th ult. he went to the defendant's shop and asked for two ounces
of milk of sulphur. On receiving it he told the defendant that it had been
bought to be analysed. The defendant said that she had no reason to believe
anything was wrong, and that it was what was usually sold as milk of sulphur.
The analyst's certificate showed that the article sold contained forty-five per
cent, of sulphate of lime. A fine of five shillings an'd two shillings costs was
And" so the justice of the case was perhaps met, if the defendant,
a female chemist and druggist, had done no worse than neglecting
to assure herself that her drugs were pure. But then who were the
wholesale dealers by whom she was supplied with ostensible " milk
of sulphur " nearly one half of it plaster of Paris? The adulteration
of this pulverulent sort of milk is rather more prejudicial to health
than that of the fluid so-called, otherwise " skv-blue," diluted only
with the juice from " the cow with the iron tail." Milk of sulphur
is a medicine; but sulphate of lime, if swallowed, can answer no
purpose but that of taking neat and elegant casts of the interiors of
the digestive organs. These, however accurate and admirable, form
obstructions producing such results as to justify the declaration
that, if MRS. KIRBY was sufficiently punished with a penalty of
seven shillings, some other dealers in drugs and chemicals ought to
be hanged.

"Munchausen." Members must have been somewhere where

Merely looking into the crater of Etna will not secure election.
"John Bull." For Gentlemen who can pay their way and horse-

"John Barleycorn." For the Yeomen of England. Amber ale.
Breakfasts always ready at five in the morning.
"Bull and Bear." Curiously sumptuous. Entrance fee a

have any weather that he likes, on paying the small sum requisite for
the Clerk's deputy's subordinate's servant's fag's expenses—a nominal

If a few farmers are found punching each other's heads, let us hope
that this will not interfere with a rational meteorological arrange-

Good luck may vanish, or bad hick mend:
Put each in your pipe and smoke it, friend!
If you love a Lady, fair to view,
And she turns with a cold contempt from you,
While at your rival a smile she darts—
Walking in pride on a pathway of hearts,
Wrapt in her softness, dainty and nice,
Fire in her eyes, at her bosom ice—
In search of returns precious time why spend?
Put your love in your pipe and smoke it, friend!
Ifyou climb the ladder of politics, where
Whoso ascends breathes difficult air;
And, being highest 9f men of the time,
Are slightly elate with your seat sublime,
A little apt at yourself to wonder,
And mistake your own bray for real thunder;
Think how rockets rise and how sticks descend—
Put success in your pipe and smoke it, friend.
If Fame be your foot-ball, any day
A stronger player may kick it away.
Hound you to-day Lion-hunters smother;
Next week the Lion's skin goes to another.
From Popularity's box-seat hurled.
Lie still and see your successor purled.

HOW TO FLOAT THE "VANGUARD."
DEAB MR. POUCH,—I see that the Lords of the Admiralty have at
last entered into a contract with an eminent French engineer to raise
the sunken Vanguard, and that the method he proposes adopting is
to till the interior of the vessel with air-bags.
Now, Sir, I am glad to be able to inform their Lordships that the
requisite motive power is to be found on the spot, free of all;expense.
Let the Primate of the Irish Church summon, the General Synod
(which is to meet in Dublin next week) to assemble in the hull of
the ship, and there will be wind-bags enough among the.members
to float the vessel immediately.
MB. DILLON'S system, too, of raising the ship would also by this
means obtain a fair trial; for the Synod (at which great heat is
always generated) would not be long sitting before there would be
an explosion that would either raise the hull of the vessel, or else
blow it into small pieces, and so get it out of the way.
Hoping that your influential advocacy may be given to this simple,
economical, and efficacious method, I remain,
Your obedient servant,

HAPPY THOUGHTS OF A DISTINGUISHED
AMERICAN ENGINEER.
A DISTINGUISHED American En-
gineer has just startled the
speculative world with a scheme
for decanting the Black Sea into
the Caspian. Although at least
three hundred miles apart, the
distinguished American Engineer
assures us that a cutting of less
than two hundred miles is all that
} is wanted to unite the two. Of
course the D. A. E. ought to know
his business, and, judging by the
other transcendental propositions
for changing the normal con-
dition of our badly - organised
globe which are to bo found in
the said D. A. E.'s memoranda,
there can be no reason to suppose
that the scheme will not meet
with entire success.
But the D. A. E. has other
schemes to follow, hot and hot, like chops at a London eating-
house. Here are his Mems. of a few of them:—
Mem. A.—Scheme for converting the Falls of Niagara into a
natural bridge. Construction of works for blasting a tunnel beneath
the cataract. Consequent counteraction of force and reversal by
suction of the Falls themselves. Gradual change of current and
solution of problem.
Mem. B.—Establishment and registration of Great Geyser Hot
Bath Company (Limited). Conduct of series of iron pipes from
principal Geyser Depot in Iceland. Submarine service. Every
man to have his own Geyser turned on by proprietary tap.
Mem. C.—Scheme to supply the Serpentine with pure water from
Lake Ontario, by cutting a connecting canal beneath the Atlantic
Ocean. To be considered.
Mem. D.—The Philanthropic Super-Volcanic Omelette Society.
It .has been discovered that if, on the principle of the common
syphon, the ocean could be poured into the well-known volcanoes
Vesuvius, Etna, Heela. Chimborazo. and others, their active fires
might be extinguished, and the thousands of ostrich eggs now
wasted every year in Africa—having been collected by the hordes of
negro races now ravaged by the slave trade—might he cooked over
the smouldering embers to the amount probably of 6,100,800
per diem.
The mode of construction of these syphons, and the necessary
works for sinking them in the seas contiguous to the volcanic fires,
is as yet the secret of the distinguished American Engineer.
Mem. E.—Cyclopean Dyke Scheme, to cut out the Submarine
Channel Companies. Massive Dykes of Cyclopean masonry to be
constructed on either side the lines of transit from Dover to Calais,
one to the north, the other to the south. The Dykes, onco con-
structed, mere child's play to drain the intermediate space. (Mom.,
to supply therewith salt water and fish to the Westminster and
Margate Aquaria.) To turn the current of the North Sea towards
the Baltic, and that of the English Channel round the Bay of
Biscay, and there you are—an isthmus of Dover. The rest follows
at once. Limited liability.
GONE WEONG!
A XEW NOVEL. BY MISS BHODY DENDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh Down like a Shower," "Red in the Nose, is She,"
"Qoodl Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, Bui don't Tell."
CHAPTER. VIII.— What the Author says.
"GOOD-BYE, JEAMES!" BELLA said, after a long silence. "I 'm
going."
"Call me DUSOVEB," he exclaimed to her, in his great despair.
"' Dr/sovER!'" she murmured, in the moonlight.
He rose, unsteadily,' as the grand Camelopard draws itself up to its
towering height, Agamemnon-like, among its fellows; he sprang
after her, laid his iron hand on her arm. and said, in a low, hissing
whisper,—hissing as though he were disgusted with her present
performance—
"Are you a-goin'?"
"I am."
"You give me up'?"
"Like a conundrum."
He groaned aloud, and smote his hands together violently; if he
had hissed before, this she was fain to accept as a sign of his ap-
plause; and so, smiling, she curtsied gracefully in the strong lime-
like moonbeams, as DUSOVER, taking a bouquet from his tail coat-
pocket, threw it to her with a bitter, cruel smile.
Once more the soft, white, resolute, bewitching face let fall the
rich fringe of its drooping eyelids on the peach-like bloom of her
full, round cheek, as she made a deep, classically-bending obeisance.
"Where are we now?" he asked, hoarsely, huge pearl-beads of
perspiration standing on his wide, bold forehead.
"Here!" she replied, braving him in the moonlight, helpless,
powerless, tearless, doubtless, but dauntless: the soft eyes were
looking hard at him: the white face showed nothing, now, save
black looks: not a bit pretty now: only very pale, very brave, and
very perspiring.
"You have kept me here too long," she said. And so saying, she
turned—there, on the spot, where she was standing, she turned, as
the whitest, purest, mildest milk will turn, when detained too long
in a warm corner, as BELLA had been this night,
"Stop a moment!" he said, quite broken-voiced. And he clasped
her once more in his strong, rigid, despairing, straining arms.
"My darling!" he went on in a sweet, wavering voice, to which
the sort words, uttered through a speaking-trumpet, on the swelling
bosom of the silent listening ocean, could bo but as the tender
sucking-pig's whisper on a warm autumnal eve, " You brave little
child! You soft little person! You cheery, sweet, doughy, little
apple-dumpling of my eye! You little, cruel, darling!" And the
sound of his passionate, murmuring words, pierced into her very
soul, as though she were listening to the beating of the muffled drum
of her ear. over the grave of her buried hopes. They two, standing
on that silent crystal shore, on a sheet of silver sand,—the sea—the
great German Ocean, all silver too,—all German silver—booming, and
lowing at their feet—its waves "running in" one another like
playful police-children about the crowded strand; the bearded
oysters on their little beds dreaming of happy months without any
letter "r" in them: the unsleeping winkle singing his pleasant
song, and not caring one pin for any mortal being; the pulpy,
bilious sponge drinking in deep, cooling, saline draughts; and they
two, looking strangely, wildly, dreamily into each other's eyes.
It cannot last for ever! They cannot remain thus, hand-in-hand,
motionless, fixed, obstructing the traffic for all time.* No: the un-
loving, constable-like, sentimentless coastguard will pass this way,
and bid these two "Move on!" Nay, even the routine-loving,
mechanical sea will wash the polish from their patent leather boots
in sighing, murmuring protest against the wanton trespass.
Her solemn, tragic eyes, fixed on his plain, burnt face—tanned all
over, thickly, like a circus—travel slowly upward from his great,
mellow, medlar-coloured beard to his rich, deep-toned, drooping
moustache, and, ascending the point of his ugly nose, rest for some
seconds, sadly, on that bridge of size. So they remain: a strange
sight in the middle of the strand: a tall, ugly man, a fair, be-
witching woman; her lovely eyes on his plain face.
"Tell me," he says, with a very whitey-brown look, and a hoarse,
nervous laugh, "do you still love me?"
She feels a fiery, searing pain that, hut for her bravery, would
make her'scream in sudden agony, as she has seen—at some vague
time she could scarcely recall when—the Clown start, after he had
unwittingly placed the red-hot poker in his trousers-pocket, and
,hen had sat on it.
"BELLA!" he cries, impulsively clutching her small, passive
tiands.
She does not answer. She is listening to a whistling oyster, and a
talking fish.
The pale moon is becoming paler •with her night watch, tireder
and tireder she grows of this love-making, lovc-dostroving scene,
and the first blushing, crimson-red, morning star, slowly shines forth,
as though drawing aside the dark blue curtain of night, and holding
its small, bright candle to the rising sun-g^od.
A small buoy, unperceived by them till now, breaks restlessly
from its moorings, and seems threatening to float with the stream to
Wollum, and tell what he has witnessed of their meeting.
Could she bear exposure? Could he?
He. could; strong, hard, japanned, brown-burnt as he was, he
could bear any amount of exposure, as men always can. But for
the tender shrinking woman, what of her? Would she be bent and
broken, like the timid bulrush, before the searching blast of a
sirocco of scandal? No; it would be her death. The buoy knew
that, and could make terms.
"We must part," she says, coldly.
"I hateparting," he answers, abruptly.
"So do I," she returns. "But the buoy is waiting; and if you
will not part, I must."
She draws from a small purse a shining coin, and tosses it dis-
dainfully to the buoy, whose silence has been, she thinks, thereby
purchased.
Once more their hands interlocked, and the fair, broad moon is
* What the Public lays.—" We are glad to hear it cannot last for ever."

quailing before the cruel, red stripes of streaky light that stripe-
paint the sky, as though it were a gloriously illumined side of
breakfast bacon.
"One last kiss!" he cried, husky-voiced, yet holding the prize
— which he had so nearly won, and so lately lost—in his iron bon-
dage. "BELLA! ray darling! my own! my sweet, soft, scrumpshous
little dumpling-! Do you know how much" 1 love you 'i"
"No," replied BELLA, crying pitifully, and her big eyes looking
up at him through her tears, like quivering, guttering rushlights,
in which the flame of love was dying out, shining through a rushing
Niagara of overflowing grief.
It was DUSOVER'S sole chance—it had come to the point of "now
or never"—he chose "now," and throwing off the last rag of con-
straint, he let the floodgates of his passion loose, to the utter destruc-
tion of his painfully-acquired grammar, and wrapping his long,
supple, muscular arms round and round her as she stood, wound her
into his coils as the deadly, mesmeric-eyed boa-constrictor hugs the
fascinated rabbit, tighter, tighter, bending his head down from its
stately height—as the tell giraffe to nibble the lowly buttercup—
to cull the fresh, moist, dewy bloom on her pouting lips, nearer,
nearer—
"He squeezeth, ns, with feverish palms, the boy
Squeezcth the pipful orange, which, when squoze,
He chucketh down, a shapeless, tattered, rind,
To make the thoughtful slip, the cureless fall."
"I loves yer so much," hissed DFSOVER huskily in her ear—the
whole JEAMES of Bukley Square breaking out in the burst of un-
restrained, furious passion—" I lores yer so Jiairfii/ much tin—there—
/ could bile yer all to nothink, mill iline liajf yi'r, icit/mut n I'l-lish,
as if yer tcos tripc-a-noniuns!"
I confess I am tired of writing about love-making.* When two
people have reached the summit, they cannot go any higher, and,
it may be, have both to come down again.
In his strong embrace she was almost powerless, but battling with
her strong, turbid love, which would not, for worlds, have injured a
hair of that dark, crisp, curly hcnd, she whispered in his ear—
"PrsovER! JEAJTKS! hrrr '.< <i jxilircman coming!"
Then he let her go, and dashing her, almost roughly, against the
impassive rocks, strode onwards without one lingering glance or
grudging sigh, turning his back to the rising sun, as though scorn-
fully refusing the one offer of celestial hope that dawns each morn-
ing upon a guilty, foggy world. So he strode onwards, tall, solitary,
glaring-eved, with a canker-worm at his heart, and the small,
blue-eyed flower she had given him in his button-hole. So strode
he on, and so was lost to view.
Then poor, erring, wayward, loving BELLA, free at last, clomb the
sheer cliff, and threw herself down on the warm, soft, mown grass,
damp with the dews of night, as with the tears of angels on sweet
hay.
"I don't care how wicked he is," she said to herself, while
tumbling restlessly among the poppies, and weeping as though she
would cry her heart out. "I have lost him! He has gone!—for
ever!!"
The Lark rose, singing blithely, and was lost in heaven.
"That teas a Lark!" she exclaimed, looking upward. "He has
disappeared! Are there Larks still going on above the skies f"
Frantic passion, utterly uncurbed, made the girl recklessly wicked.
She rolled about all over the field, amonp the long grass, so that the
farmer might as well have had a hurricane over his property, so
entirely was the outline of her soft, plump form marked out in the
crushed and crumpled herbage.
"I am not one of those little muslin dolls," she cried, in un-
governed frenzy, "with wax heads and china hands, and all the

to request that we may have no more of this in the present novel. We are
bound, however, by our duty to our renders, to inform them that our Maiden
Aunt—who still represents the female interest at our impartial board—is of
opinion that there's no actual harm in it, and that in n powerful situation
powerful writing is necessary. We, in a calm and dignified letter to the
distinguished Authoress, ask, is it necessary to invent situations which demand
such 'powerful' writing? Do you not, my dear lady (we say), dwell just a
little too much on what might be (according to your own admirably artistic
suggestion in a former letter to us) left entirely to imagination. For instance,
wilh respect we advance this—why couldn't jour hero say,' / have deceived
you. My calves are false; and / am a married man. Good-bye.' Then,
unable to restrain fits emotion, they took a touching farewell of one 'another,
and so parted. There you arc—in a nutshell. Now, isn't your graphic and
—excuse us— rather sptm-out description of their embracing, caressing, hug-
ging, &c., both far too much and far too strong f—ED. (for Self and Partners).
What the Authoress says.—" Too strong i—nonsense! It isn't milk-and-

right-sized thing!" she said, pinching her own round, firm arm
quite fiercely. "There's not much sawdust in you!"
So she went on, this poor, xmgoverned soul,' and all the while
the little watch was ticking in her pocket, at her left side, as though
to remind her of the debt due from poor Humanity.
Suddenly she leapt up. She had told DUSOVEB that a policeman
was coming. Had she been right? Was that dark form approach-
ing indeed a stern, unbending constable'{ True, she had not till
this moment noticed the writing of the finger of fate on the board in
the field, yet it was there, clear and above-board, "Trespassers will
be prosecuted."
"Hallo, young woman! What the"
She waited for no more; but, like a hunted deer, she bounded
over the hedge, politely stooping her head beneath the interlacing
kissing boughs, and sprung into the narrow lane.

THE NEW BATTLE OF LIMERICK.

COEK bates the world for butter,
Unless Waterford out-out her,
And Dublin, Belfast, Galway has their backers less or more;
But for fish-hooks, gloves, and laces,
And the colleens' pretty faces,
'Tis limerick bangs all places, that flower of Shannon Shore.
'Twas there that SMITH O'BaiEN,
Of the ould Milesian Line,
Was mobbed at a tay-party, when the windy-blinds they tore;
And now Limerick to her story
Adds a ruction still more gory,
Resistin' Home-Rule's glory, upon Shannon Shore!
Ye Heroes of the Nation,
Keep your pathriot indignation
For thraytors that would sell the pass, as they have done before.
But bad cess to the shillelagh
Of that Fenian. JOHN DALY,
Friends and Home-Rule ussuilin' upon Shannon Shore!
Oh, iligant the views is
Out of " The George " and " Cruise's,"
Convanient to the Crescent, and the Club first-floor.
And the stone nigh Thomond Bridge is,
Where the Saxon sacrilegious
Signed.'the treaty he broke outrageous, to the shame of Shannon Shore.
The Home-Rulers they invited
ISAAC BUTT, Q.C., delighted,
As sure'he a right 'ud have to be, upon that score—
Spite of Fenians bent on baulkin'
That illustrious Q.C.'s talkin'.
And the Thrades wid banners walkin' along Shannon Shore.
Wid BTTTT there came O'SHAUGHNESSY,
Almost as great a man as he,
To prove'Home-Rule the panacy for poor Ould Ireland's sore.
And O'SuLLiVAN faced the throng wid him,
That for Limerick sits along wid mm,
Who 'd^have thought things could go wrong wid him upon Shannon
Shore!
And the Bishop, wid his Clargy,
Whin he looked and talked so large he
Thought little of the charge he would see e'er all was o'er;
And the Priests they walked in honour
Of Home-Rule, a blessin' on her,
And the Thrades wid bands and banners delighted Shannon Shore.
To the Crescent they marched gaily,
But 'twas there they found JOHN DALY,
Wid his "back agin the railins, and some fifty Fenians more,
Each an alpeen in his fist,
To which he gev' a twist.
Then let fly and never missed the head he meant to score!
'Twas the Fenians that begun
On Home-Rulers ten to one,
Knocked the wind out of their drums, and their thrumpets battered
sore;
Sure 'twas luck that MISTHER SLATTERr
Closed his shutters ere the batthery,
Or his plate-glass front had suffered, that day, on Shannon Shore.
Both sides " Ould Ireland!" cryin',
Their nate black-thorns was plyin',
Blood was spilt, and boys was kilt, and drums, coats, banners
sthrewed the flure:
Savs O'SULLIVAN to O'SHAUGHNESSY,
'' Where 'a BUTT? To talk the man is he;
To put out a flame or fan, as he, who BO good on Shannon Shore?"
But eloquence Parliamint'ry
Finds to Irish ears no intry,
While there's shillelaghs going among foes, or friends, still more:
So as long as DALY'S boys,
Had hands alpeens to poise,
Sure they 'd make BUTT hould his noise on Shannon Shore.
But in spite of phillaloo,
^y^rile sticks clashed and brickbats flew,
BUTT'S iligant discoorse flowed on serene amidst the roar,
And he said that his reception
Was a triumph that bould Neptune
Had never seen the likes of since his tide kissed Shannon Shore.
Sure the sweetness of his gammon
Would have wiled a Shannon salmon,
While, like Kilkenny cats, the boys they scrimmaged, scratched,
and swore;
And he spoke on widout shyin',
Though the brickbats they was thryin',
And both sixes sinseless lyin', along the Shannon Shore.
Oh 'twas sure a lovely sight,
That free and festive fight—
Who dars say Limerick's heart is not Irish to the core ?—
Ruction round.
Shannon Shore!
When Young Ireland's House is seen
In full blast on Palace Green,
Will they take votes by alpeen betwixt BUTT'S and DALY'S corps?
Will hard heads and hard hits sway 'i
Or will humbug win the day?
For a forecast of that future, go and look on Shannon Shore?
DISAPPOINTED OE DANA.
'TwiXT the cup and the lip we encounter a slip. We anticipated
the arrival of a well-known gentleman of high character, culture,
and attainments, as Ambassador from the United States—MB. DANA,
the author of Two Years Before the Mast. But the Senate—as
represented by its Foreign Committee—has refused to confirm
PRESIDENT GRANT'S nomination. MB. DANA is rejected on a charge
of " literary piracy." preferred by that model of moral and political
purity, GENERAL BUTLER. The alleged piracy, if proved, would
consist of an insignificant infringement, in editing an edition of
Wheaton's International Law, of a disputed copyright in certain
notes to a previous edition. As MB. DANA denies the piracy,
GENERAL BUTLEB further charges him with falsehood; and, having
denied it on oath, further still with perjury. The piracy would be
merely technical if true. And to be sure MR. DANA once stood
against GENERAL BUTLER in the Essex district for Congress, and the
Democratic section of the Senate had political reasons for voting
his rejection. But never let us suppose they were swayed by these.
Trust we rather that an extreme and oversensitively nervous horror
of "literary piracy" carried them away; that their judgment was
perverted by excessive scrupulosity lest the faintest shadow of a
shade of a suspicion of literary piracy should sully the fair name of
an American Foreign Minister.
This too fastidious moral sense of respect for the rights of author-
ship has expressed itself in gross injustice and indignity to MB.
DANA. We are very sorry for that. But our sorrow cannot but
derive some assuagement from a selfish hope. How gratifying to
behold the Senate of the United States now at length suddenly
awakened to the enormity of " literary piracy," and that piracy,
however trifling, represented, however falsely, to have been com-
mitted in compiling notes to a treatise on International Law! The
new abhorrence of the United States' Senate for that species of
theft is doubtless shared by the House of Representatives, and
British authors and publishers may now of course expect with per-
fect confidence that the American Congress and Government will at
their very earliest possible convenience unite in enacting a conven-
tion with this country for a scheme of International Copyright.

A DREAM OF MAGNIFICENT UGLY MEN.
DUB Mi;. PUNCH,
Iji the admirable novel, Gone Wrong, which is now appearing in your columns, the Hero is described as "a magnificent ugly man,"
a favourite type with certain lady-writers of the period. Being anxious to obtain work as a book-illustrator, I beg to send you a few specimens
of that particular kind of hero; they are all carefully drawn from Nature, as far as the face is concerned, several of my friends having kindly
volunteered to sit to me with their features flattened against a window-pane, and otherwise distorted. Tlie torsos and legs have been copied
from an anatomical lay-figure, dressed in appropriate costume,—and I owe the hirsute appearance of the neck, hands, 4c. (so dear to some lady-
novelists), to a stuffed ape in my possession. 1 have also conscientiously laboured to imbue their physiognomies with as much vice, selfishness,
and ferocity, as the size of the drawing will admit, and I think you will own they are not the kind of persons to be trifled with.
Trusting that you will accord me the favour of publicity in your widely circulated journal,
P.S.—I enclose my card. * remain, your obedient servant, STICKLEBACK.
THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE.
(A Matter-of-fact Idyll.)
IT was a lovely spring day. The sun was shining brightly in a
cloudless sky. and the bushes were green with early leaf-jbuds. It
was during the recess, and Punch was enjoying his holiday. He
was lying on his back near a silvery stream. In his right hand he
held a tony cigarette, and in his left he clasped a newspaper. As he
looked up into the cloudless sky, and heard the murmur of the
running brook, he could not help contrasting the pleasant peace of
the country with the reckless riot of the town. And as he pondered,
he heard the sweet voice of the Nightingale.
"Welcome, thrice welcome, charming song-bird!" he whispered.
"You are early this year. You seldom make your appearance
before May. You are very early."
"Not too early, Mr. Punch," replied a gentle voice. "Now
don't move!" it continued, as the Sage was about to turn. "You
cannot see me. Enough that you hear my words. Not too early. I
say; for my voice is needed as an advocate for the sick poor—the
sick poor who linger and die in the great city over yonder.
"My dear Madam, I am all attention," Punch answered. "I
call vou ' Madam,' because I know I am talking to a lady."
"Yes, you know me, Mr. Punch. Twenty years ago, when they
talked about the Guards' Memorial, you sent in a design of which I
was the central figure."
"I made a mistake just now, Madam. I gave you a wrong title.
In the hospital at Scutari you were called an angel."
"I am satisfied to call myself a Nurse, and as a Nurse—a Nurse of
large experience—I wish to speak to you, to ask you to add your
efforts to my own in the cause of the suffering poor. Do you know
what illness means when it reaches the homes of the labouring
classes?"
"Yes. I have read the newspapers."
"Ah, but you must see the misery yourself to understand the full
meaning of the word. When disease enters the poor man's dwelling,
what was once a little better than a hovel becomes a pigstye. And
it is the District Nurse (whose cause I plead) who must lead the van
in the crusade against dirt and fever-nests—the crusade to let light
and air and cleanliness into the worst rooms of the worst places of
sick London. It is she who must show the poor how to make their
rooms clean. She must sweep and dust away, empty and wash out
all the appalling dirt and foulness. She must rub the windows,
sweep the fireplace, carry out and shake the bits of old sacking and
carpet, and lay them down again, fetch fresh water and fifl the
kettle, and make the bed. And when she has done all this, her real
work commences as a sick nurse."
"Never-ending, thankless toil," murmured Punch.
"Not so," replied the gentle voice. "It may be never-ending,
for it may begin again and again in new room after new room; but
it is not thankless. To give the poor a clean home is to bestow as
great a benefit as can be conferred upon them. This is the way to
depauperise them. When a poor woman's house is once clean, it is
her pride to keep it clean. She has been taught by the District
Nurse what to do, and the lesson is not thrown away upon her. In
one case, where a Nurse had tidied up one of the most loathsome dens
imaginable, on the day following the cleansing, the eldest girl, a
child of eight, scoured the place, and was found perched on a three-

UNITED STATES to assume forthwith the title of the
EMPEROR OP CALIFORNIA, in order to protect that State
from Chinese annexation.
legged stool, trying to wash the dirty linen with her poor little thin
arms."
"The District Nurse must be the Angel in the House," said
Punch.
"You shall hear what her duties are before you decide. First,
she has to nurse. Secondly, she has to put the room in nursing
order; that is, to make the room such as a patient can recover in.
Thirdly, to bring such sanitary defects as produce sickness and
death to the notice of the Public Officer whom they may concern.
Nursing means keeping records of the patient's state, including
pulse, temperature, &c., for the doctor, and attending to every
want. When the room is in nursing order, the work of the hardest-
worked housemaid has been performed. When sanitary defects arc
pointed out, dust-bins are emptied, water-butts are cleaned, and
defective water supply and drainage are examined and remedied."
"Hard work, indeed!" murmured Punch.
"So hard," continued the gentle voice, "that when the Nurses
return to their homes they must rest. They have other things to do
than to cook for and wait upon themselves. And the homes and the
Nurses both cost money. Each District Nurse must have, before she
is qualified, a month's trial in district work, a year's training in
hospital work, and a quarter's training in district nursing under the
Superintendent-General.''
And what has been done up to the present time?" asked Punch.
He had grown accustomed to the voice, and he listened with interest
to the answer.
"There is but one District Home with five hospital-trained Nurses,
and three Nurse-candidates. To make the scheme a success, with
branches extending over the metropolitan area, a capital of £20,000,
and an income of £5,000 a-year are needed."
"One more question," said Punch. "Where may subscriptions
be sent?"
"To the Secretary of the Metropolitan and National Nursing
Association, 23, Bloomsbxiry Square, W.C."
And then Punch woke; for he had dreamed a dream.
Not quite a dream, for in his hand he held a paper containing a
letter signed "FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE." He read the last few
lines:—
"I ask the public not to add one more charity or relief agency to the many
that are already, but to support a charity—truly ' metropolitan in its scope,
and truly 'national' if carried out—which never has been before."
And as he read these words, the nightingale in the sky sang its
song.
"You are outdone!" exclaimed Punch. "There is a Nightingale
still upon the earth who sings a sweeter song than yours—a song
that should find its echo in the hearts of the rich, and have for a
reward the earnest blessings of the suffering poor."
A Wholesome Mixture.
IN a recent number of the Scotsman will be found an announce-
ment of a marriage between a scion of the house of JAMESON, of
Dublin whiskey renown, and a ditto of the house of HAIG, of the
celebrated Cameron Bridge Scotch distillery. May the mixture lead
to nothing but the best spirits on both sides; and may there have
been no preliminary refusal-oil to mar the smack of meeting lips
and the blend of loving hearts in the new firm, let us hope never to
be shaken, of HAIG, JAMESON & Co.

THE IIEAD-QUAKTERS 0V HEALTH.
AN illustration of the saying that the shoemaker's wife and
children are ever of all people the worst shod, more signal even than
that exhibited by the ill-ventilated Royal Institution, the chief seat
of Chemistry, presents itself in the ill-drained public offices at
Whitehall, the quarters, inter alia, of the Local Government Board,
successor to the Board of Health. Of these offices, which are among
the recent achievement s of the contractors under the Board of Works—
"The drainage is so defective that visitors to the building, and those whose
unfortunate lot compels them to pass their liven there, are forced to breathe an
atmosphere which their sense of smell soon tells them is tainted with sewer
^;is. The drains pass in some parts under the buildings, the joints are de-
fective, and the buildings have settled, the result beingthat the basement ia
in parts flooded. The whole energies of the Board of Works are occupied in
(.'fleeting little ridiculous economies in articles of office furniture; and unless
sntne champion arise to stir them up, many a poor fellow will suffer from the
ell'ects of breathing polluted air, as I understand some already have."
Thus far, in the Times. "OsnriA SANITAS." This ought to be the
motto of the Board of Works, but at Whitehall we rind, on the
contrary, quaidam, and plurima—indeed, insanitas. Not only are
sanitary arrangements conspicuous by their absence, but conditions
thence resulting are odoriferous from their presence. The basement
of that building is evidently in a most vile state; and the tilth, not
removed from it by being laid at the door of the Board of Works,
may be pointed to as an example of the lowest depth of muddle.
Obviously, an outbreak of typhoid fever is imminent at the very
centre of sanitary authority. Sanitary Reform, like Charity, should
begin at home. Let the Board of Works set some Hercules imme-
diately at work to cleanse its own Augean stable, and not leave it a
warning in the nose of all local authorities who eome to consult their
central oracle, "how not to do it."

a black-velvet skirt to your black-velvet jerkin. If you could only
see yourself as others saw you on Wednesday! You looked, for all

butler would have spared us the comical effect of a broad baldric of
gilt plates worn obliquely over his black tights and portly bow-

once more comely and more comfortable. I repeat, people can't

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

HUT-UP—Lion! What
is the use of growling
any longer? Time is
gone by; majorities
are.mightyj DISRAELI
is determined; the
advice will be given;
the Proclamation will
be issued; the title
will be assumed ; and
VICTORIA, Queen of
England, will be
henceforth VICTORIA,
Empress of India.
Such is theposition in
which the House finds
the BENJAMIN'S mess
of the Imperial Titles
on reassembling after
Easter (Jfonilni/,
April 24). La Heine
le veut. Ainsi soit-il.
England—exceptthat
portion of England
which would rather
be rid of a Queen al-
together — does not
want it. India—in
so far as she has a
voice to speak—declares site doesn't want it. "Who dues want it? That is the question not
to be asked—or, at least, if asked, not to be answered—as MB. ANDERSON found out, when
he wanted to know who told MB. LOWE that two Prime Ministers before ME. DISRAELI had
been pressed to do this thing, and had respectfully declined. Was it a Privy Councillor let
this Court-Cat out of the bag ?" That's U-llings,'" as the children say. MB. LOWE isn't a
Minister now, and the privilege of being; questioned in the favourite Parliamentary game of
"cross questions and crooked answers " is confined to Ministers. MB. FAWCETT had asked for a
day "to move the House's disapproval of the advice given to HEB MAJESTY by Her Majesty's
Ministers." But as MR. FAWCETT couldn't get his day before Easter, thanks to MR. KNATCH-
BUXL HUG ESSEN and MAJOE BEAnioKT,who stopped the way with their perfectly ineffectual
brace of motions, and as the Leader of Her Majesty's Government declines to measure swords
except with the^ Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition, and as LORDHABTINGTON, though ready
to support MR. FAwncrronamotion for a vote of censure, declines, under the circumstances, to
move such a vote himself, and so run his head against the stone wall of the Ministerial
majority, cadit quautio. There is a good riddance of bad rubbish. The Opposition must
remain content with what it has done in the way of protestation against a blunder which it
considers nothing less than deplorable, in common with the overwhelming majority of
intelligent^and loyal subjects out of doors.
So let England shut her eyes—not open her mouth—and see what the QUEEN will give her.
Who^knows'?..She.mav'have'had^her Royal
eves opened to'the real state of the case at
the eleventh hour, and may shrink from
the change of title after all! \t all events,
Punch won't believe in "VICTORIA Im-
neratrix" till he has it under her own
Royal hand. (Poor Punch.' So he wrote
some davs ago. He has it now. It spoiled
his breakfast last Saturday.)
Oh dear, oh cloar, those debates in Com-
mittee on the Merchant Shipping Bill!
with the puzzle-headed but eminently well-
ing PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF
Tu\r>K on the one side, and the almost as
puzzle-headed, and still better meaning,
Member fur Derby on the other. Between
the two, what should be debates sink into
wrangles, and neither ever seems quite to
know what the other is at. Wrangle No. 1
concerned Grain Cargoes. MR. PLIMSOLL
wants to prescribe the means of safetv: to
regulate by Act of Parliament the shape,
si/e, and thickness of shifting-boards for
such cargoes. Those who have framed the
Bill have been satisfied to require means
for obviating shift of cargoes, without pre-
scribing those means. Punch would say,
by the. liirht of common sense, that those in
charge, of the Bill have the best of it.
Wrangle No.' 2 was over Deck-loads.
Everybody who knows anything of the sub-
ject admits winter deck-loads to bo one of
the most fruitful sources of danger to life
at sea.
MR. PLXMSOLL wants absolute prohibi-
tions of such loads, with due exceptions
to be fixed by the Board of Trade. All
the Board of'Trade will concede is, that
deck-loads shall pay tonnage-dues. But
i he.knowing; ones seem agreed that if MB.
PI.IMSOLI, asks too much, the Government
give too little.
Hours were spent in beating about the
bush, till SIR STAFFORD NORTHCOTE stepped
in to help his lame brother ADDEBLEY over
the stile, and got MR. PLIMSOLL defeated
by 108 to 75.
Is it quite impossible to import a little
more clearness of head and distinctness.of
purpose into the Government conduct of
the Bill? SIR CHARLES ought surely to have
a foot to put down, considering what a foot
he has to put in. Whv don't well-meaning
men learn to convey their meaning?
Tuesday.—We have already expressed
the quintessence of what passed to-night
about the Royal Titles Bill between tin-
Heads of Her Majesty's Government, and
Her Majesty's Opposition. Besides, now
the Proclamation has been issued, why waste
more words on what is past pray ing against?
Wednesday. — PENTHESILEA in arms,
under the male mask of the Member for
Marylebone. All the old arguments, for
and against Female Franchise trotted out
in better form than ever. A curious divi-
sion of the BBIOHTS. JACOB for the Ladies;
Brother-in-Law LEATHAH, and Brother
JOHN against.
The honest avowal of plain JOHN that
he was wrong when he voted with STUART
MILL for giving votes to the Spinsters and
Widows, had a great deal to do in deter-
mining the division (239 to 152) against the
Member for Marylebone.
MR. SMOLLETT, victim of his name, flun?
a good deal of the mud which he mistakes
for wit into the Ladies' faces (prnh pudor /),
and MR. FAWCETT gave him a well-deserved
rap over the knuckles for it. Descended from
the Author otStoderiek linmlnni, let not OK;-
MR. S. descend below him. He is <>1<1 enough
to have learnt thai his ancestor's high-spiced
style of humour is too coarse for modern
tastes.

Loving, reverencing, and looking up to the sex, as 3fr. PunoA does,
he must needs rejoice in the defeat of those who would carry Woman
into about the dirtiest field that Man has to work m— Politics.
ThursJav.-The Lords reassembled. LORD STRATHEDEN AND
CAMPBELL called attention to the Felsted Scandal, and the BISHOP
OF ROCHESTER did not succeed in clearing himself of the discredit c
having dismissed a laborious and successful Head-Master without
inquiry, on the tx part, showing of Tru.tees, who, not to put too
fine an edge on it, had in no way entitled themselves to such con-
OnTthing isqnite true.' After speaking his mind as freely as he
had done, the Master of FoistedL could clearly, not have gone orL in
his work with advantage to the school under such a Board of Trustee*.
As the Trustees were fixtures, there was no alternative but fc
Master to go. But the question still remains, Who was to blame f<

M of Felstat. But we should have felt happier ii, as he went, th.
Bishop had been Been at his side rather than that of the Trustees. .
(Commons.)-The third bout of the fencing-match between th
Leaders, d propoi of the Royal, Titles Bill. See above for its sub
stance. Fresh interlude of the great Merchant Shipping Muddle.
The CHANCELLOR or THE EXCHEQUER stepped m as clemi « ma
china, and announced, to the great relief of the House, in
of all SIR CHARLES APDERLEY has been painfully hammering ou
for the last two nights, that the Government had decided to intro
duoe a clause directly dealing with Deck-loads of Timber-sh.ps m th
winter months, and hoped to frame a clause to prevent or pums
the improper loading of foreign ships.
SIR W. HARCOURT enjoyed the pleasure of _—
Ministerial management of the Merchant Shipping Bill for about an
our, till the ear! of the House were almost as tired as his tongue,
ut the House dropped back into the original muddle on the great
attle-frround of Load-line. Think of discussing for ever so long
whether "Billv-boys " should or should not be obliged to mark_a

at GOVERNOR HENNESST, in the hope of getting him summaril
ecalled. Meanwhile, their telegrams, read oy the light of one from
COLONEL SARGENT commanding the Military at Uarbadoes, are
jlearlv chargeable with gross exaggeration. „,«„•„„,*,
While reserving judgment till the arrival of more dispassionate
accounts of the facts, Punch trusts-as he believes the country, and
GOVERNOR HENNESST, and the Planters, and the friends of both, may
safely trust-LoRD CARNARVON. Thus far there is nothing to show
that the Planters have not been more m fault than the Governor
(Common»).-Mn. EUSTACE SMITH asked for a Select Committee to

Indian authorities.
LORD G. HAMILTON deprecated the proposed inquiry.
MR. FAWCETT declared it would do great good. _
MR. GRANT DUIT declared it would do enormous mischief.
Mr. Punch admired Doctors' differences-and wondered which
JOHN BULL would have considered the worst extravagance-
few thousands in money, and no life, or to lose a few thousands in
ttee was refused by 149 to 46; and Punch can t say
hels" sorry. On this matter he would rather be wrong with BIB

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH TO A VERY PRETTY YOUNG LADY OF FASHION.

Mr BEAR YOUNG LADY,
HERE is a picture sent in to the Royal Academy by that excel-
lent and humane friend of the Horse and of Mr. Punch—MR. WILLIAM
FLOWER. It is meant to illustrate the bearing—in the hope to forward the
fur-bearing—of bearing-reins.
Alas! the Council have rejected MR. FLOWER'S picture, like those of
many better men! "It would never do," said an influential Member
of the Council, "to give such a slap in the face to many of our most dis-
tinguished patrons—especially the Ladies, who naturally like to see their
horses well bitted up, while waiting for their fair mistresses in the court-
yard of the Academy. just as they like to see them glossy of coat and
lively of action. And I understand" (added the R.A.) "that nothing
keeps horses so lively as a tight bearing-rein." So no doubt, my dear
young Lady, in one sense it does—as the tire keeps the eels lively in the
frying-pan. But as MR. FLOWER could not exhibit his picture at the
Academy, I have had great pleasure in putting at its service a place in
my gallery, where it will be seen by (juite as numerous, intelligent, and
influential a Public as even that which crowds to ths spacious halls of
Piccadilly.
I hope, my dear young Lady, you will like the picture, and dislike the
bearing-rein, and that the next time we meet in Hyde Park, I may have
the pleasure of seeing your horses released from this torture, though they
may not toss their neads, and champ their bits, and fling the foam
about as freely as you have been accustomed to see them. 1 know your
coachman will tell you it is all nonsense; that horses take as pleasantly
to bearing-reins as young ladies to tight-lacing and high-heeled shorn. Don't believe him, my dear, but ask him how he would like
to drive in a gag; and if he says he should, try him; and then ask him his opinion of the bearing-rein on better acquaintance.
En attendant, believe me, my dear young Lady, Tours faithfully)

for their Removal.)
1. EXCEPTING on
the sly, she is in-
humanly debarred
from using a cigar-
case.

lowed to make lovf,
but merely to re-
ceive the manufac-
tured article.
3. She may not
•wear top-boots, not
even when out
hunting.
4. Unless she can
bear a lecture from
her feminine next
of kin, she must
never dream of
reading Sell's Life
or The Sportsman.
5. She cannot
even play a humble
game of Lady's
Cricket, without
being chaffed un-
mercifully.
6. Excepting at
the risk of being thought unfeminine, she must never row a Match,
nor ever'ride a Steeplechase.
7. Wh'en she bets with any member of the unfair Sex, she rarely
has the privilege of paying if she loses.
8."She is unable to go unattended to the Opera.

to flirting.
10. Excepting at great peril to her social reputation, she may not
indulge in either Black Pool or Blind Hookey.

she is not permitted the use of stronger language than " Dear me!"
or " How tiresome!"
12. While doomed in perpetuity to play on the piano, she is not

she knows his language perfectly, and longs to use the chance of
showing that she knows it.
15. By a masculine assumption, she is deemed unable to play
rackets, golf, or football, and is doomed to feeble games like battle-
dore and shuttlecock, or croquet with mild curates.
16. Though over head and ears in love, she may never make an
offer, except perhaps in Leap Year, and for this it would be hard
for her to quote an actual precedent.
17. She is expected to be able to make use of a Needle, and is
thus disabled from competing with Men in works of idleness.
18. Her ears are steeped in Slang when her Brothers come from
College, yet she is obliged, as far as possible, to keep her lips from
using it.
19. Although conscious of a guilty love for the perfume, she may
not proclaim her' preference for a Smoking Carriage.
20. If there be a Baby in the house where she is visiting, she is
presumed to be unable to talk sensibly about it.
21. When her Married Sisters call, she is always pounced upon to
entertain their Children.

cannot crack a joke or sing a comic song, without being thought
eccentric.
23. She must not practise Boxing, excepting as regards the ears of
her small brothers.
24. She is not allowed the privilege of a Latch-key. i
A Diocese in British Diggings.
AT a meeting under the presidency of the EAEL OP DEVON, at
Newton Abbot the other day, in aid of the fund for forming a new
diocese in Cornwall, it was stated that more than half the required

A SEA-FIGHT OP THE FUTURE.
LETTER I.
From the Admiral of the British Fleet to the Admiral of the
Enemy's Fleet.
SlB, High Seas. Jane 1. 187—.
I HAVE the honour to inform you that I sighted the fleet
under your command last evening. As in these days of civilisation
unnecessary bloodshed is to be deprecated, I take the earliest oppor-
tunity of letting you know that I have reason to believe, from in-
formation received through the newspapers, that my fleet is stronger
than yours. I have under my command three Iron-dads, each with
four feet of iron-plating protecting the water-line, and each carry-
ing four 200-ton guns, firing fore, aft, and all round, mounted in
turrets, protected by six feet of iron-plating, and with all the loading,
aiming and working performed bv hydraulic machinery, so that loss
of life at the guns is hardly possible on my side.
May I, under these circumstances, request you to surrender with-
out unnecessary delay?
I have the honour to he, Sir,
Your obedient Servant,
(Signed) NELSON IRONSIDE, Admiral.
(Reply.)
THE Admiral of the Enemy's Fleet presents his compliments to
the Admiral of the British Fleet, and begs to say that the Admiral
of the British Fleet has been misinformed. Toe Fleet under the
Knemy's Admiral's command consists of two Iron-clads each with
six feet of iron-plating protecting the water-line, each mounting
six guns of 300 tons, firing perpendicularly^ upwards and down-
wards, as well as fore, aft, and all round, in three turrets pro-
tected by eight feet of steel-plating, and with all the operations of
loading, priming, and firing effected by a galvanic battery worked
by a single engineer stationed ten feet below the water-line, so that
there is as good as no life to lose at the guns on his side.
As the Admiral of the Enemy's Fleet entirely reciprocates the
humanitarian ideas expressed by the Admiral of the British Fleet,
he trusts that the Admiral of the British Fleet will surrender with-
out any unnecessary delay.
LETTEE II.
From the Admiral of the British Fleet to the Admiral of the
Enemy's Fleet.
SIR, High Seas, June 2, 187—.
I HATE the honour to acknowledge your reply to my letter
of yesterday's date.
I regret to say that I am unable to comply with your request.
The rules of the Service to which I have the honour to belong do
not permit of any surrender of Her Britannic Majesty's ships. I
am forced to inform you that unless you surrender before to-morrow
morning, it will b« my painful duty to do my utmost to blow you,
your ships, and the gallant men under your command, from off the
face of the waters.
Trusting that, by your speedy surrender, you will avert this
unpleasant necessity,
I nave the honour to be. Sir,
Your most obedient Servant,
(Signed) NELSON IKONSLDE, Admiral.
(Reply.)
THE Admiral of the Enemy's Fleet presents his compliments to
the Admiral of the British Fleet, and begs to say that he is now in
a position to surrender, his flag-ship having, during the last six
hours, unluckily run into and sunk her consort.
The Admiral of the Enemy's Fleet begs to intimate that had the
force at his command been anything like equal to the force of the
British Admiral, he (the Admiral of the Enemy's Fleet) would have
considered it to be his duty to fight the battle out to the bitter end.
LETTER III.
From the Admiral of the British Fleet to the Admiral of the
Enemy's Fleet.
SIB, High Seas, June 3, 187—.
I HAVE the honour to acknowledge your reply to my letter
of yesterday's date.
1 feel in honour bound to inform you that, during the night, two
of the Iron-clads under my command have sunk each other in the
course of manoeuvres, directed with a view to perfect their ramming
practice. Under these circumstances, it has occurred to me that
perhaps you would prefer fighting to surrender. In ten minutes
my flag-snip (the remaining vessel under my command) will have the
honour of opening firs.
I have the honour to be. Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
(Signed) NELSON IRONSIDE, Admiral.

SIR,
To the Editor of Punch.
THE criticism upon my verses that appear'd in
Punch, April 15, 1876, has only just heen shown me, or
I should have replied earlier. Allow me to tell you—
Tis the measure and the time,
With thoughts witty or sublime,
Not the jingle of the rhyme,
That make verse!
Just as hatred in the heart,
Not phrases pert and smart,
Or the trickeries of Art,
Makes a curse. April 21.
N.B.—I am open to an engagement to teach both your
critics and your poets a few things to their advantage.
Oh, Horrible!
A RIVAL Composer in New York, in a jealous moment,
has imported two hundred barrel-organs into Philadel-
phia, grinding onlv the well-known airs of the best
operas of JACQUES OFFEITBACH. This ruffian in human
form is under the impression that this wholesale torture
will drive the Parisian maestro from the field, as he will
thus be made a symbol and synonym for one of the worst
forms of suffering. These practical jokes are as infectious
as murders. Only fancy a few out of the millions of anti-
Wagnerites starting a brigade of organ-grinders playing
nothing but the mysteriously monotonous recitatives of
Lohengrin and the Meistersdnger; or, perhaps—horror
on horror's head!—of Tristram and lseu.lt! But hero
our paralysed pen declines to be driven further. We
hold our ears, and gasp in speechless awe of the phantom
we have conjured up!
(Reply.) -
THE Admiral of the Enemy's Fleet presents his compliments to the
Admiral of the British Fleet, and bees to say that he accepts the
Admiral of the British Fleet's very kind invitation. Within the last
half hour the Admiral of the Enemy's Fleet has received large rein-
forcements—so that the Fleet now consists of ten iron-dads, with six
feet of iron-plating protecting the water line, and six turrets apiece,
with strength and system of guns in each turret as before stated.
Under these circumstances, he will have much pleasure in accepting
and returning the Are of the Admiral of the British Fleet.
LETTER IV.

invisible floating gun-carriages, carrying one of our newly-invented

For some centuries, or at all events for.a great number of
years. I have been engaged with my respected opponent the Unicorn
in fighting for the Crown. If the Bengal Tiger is to have a share
in the contest I shall decline to continue it. In the first place, two
to one is not fair play, and in the next place if the Tiger and my-
self got joint possession of the Crown, we should very likely begin
fighting for it between ourselves, and so thinks MR. LOWE,

honest, candid, temperate, moral, staid, of good intellect and address, pre •
possessing in appearance, of strong and healthy constitution, has travelled in
various parts of .England, France, and America, can ride, swim, row, shoot,
fence, sing, play, &c., and can give unexceptionable references, in desirous of
an ENGAGEMENT, &c., &c.
OUGHT not this paragon to have headed his advertisement, "To
Ladies of Beauty, Rank and Fortune?" Such a combination of
all the virtues and accomplishments, with personal beauty in addi-
tion, is seldom to be found. Surely he will not be long on the
market. He adds, what scarcely was necessary, that he is a " person
without conceit." Such persons are rare: but here is evidently a
perfect specimen of greatness combined with modesty. Ladies of
England, Leap Year is not over, and this admirable CRICHTON is
unmarried!

PUNCH AT PORTSMOUTH.
E— Neighbourhood of the newly-launched Iron-clad "Iiijlt xible."
Interlocutors—NEPTUNE, VULCAN, anil MR. PUNCH.
TIME—April 27, 1876.
Punch. Well, Father Nep,
and you, great Vulcan,
say—
What of our last sea-monster
—launched to-day ':•
Neptune. All hail the Inflex-
ible'.— the more the mer-
rier.—
Be it my lot to buoy, and not
to bury, her!
lrttlean. Ten thousand tons!
Seven hundred thousand
pounds!
And twetaty-four -inch ar-
mour! All that sounds
Convincingly colossal. Yet
beware f
You may forge armour past
all strength to bear.
Can those who arm the most,
in safety feel?
Nay, trust your foes to find
Achilles' heel.
Punch. With power on ar-
mour-plates old Vulcan
speaks;
And Neptune knows the
worth of silver streaks
Without the means to guard them. Waves environ
Our shores; we 've mighty store of gold and iron;
But vain are both without the will—and brain—
To keep our power unshaken on the main,
And more than match for all who chance to come ;—
A difficult and ever-shifting sum
Beyond Red-Tapist's reckoning! Yet till JOHN
Can tottle that, all reeds he rests upon
Are rotten, though as high their heads they rear
As
Neptune. Eight-and-seventy million pounds a year?
Punch. Just so! Yet twice that were no penny lost,
Were safety purchased at the monstrous cost.
But muffs waste every farthing that they spend,
While stopping short of that supremest end.
JOHN'S Fleet's his fate!
Neptune. Let him lay that to heart,
Of all his rivals get—and keep—the start;
Kick out the bunglers, quash the squabblers, loose
His purse-strings like a man—not like a goose!—
Make this the rule that, whether Blues or Buffs
Be in, the Navy shan't be left to muffs,
And—well, I '11 do what now I 'd rather not—
Praise without arriere pensee yon huge pot
On which he prides himself, a nine days wonder
Till some new Behemoth outroars its thunder!
Punch. Your lips drop weighty wisdom!
Vulcan. JOHN should try
To pick it up. Give him the tip! Good-bye!
[Exeunt NEPTUNE and VULCAN severally.
Punch (solus, thoughtfully surveying the newly-launched Colossus).
Sagacious counsel! echo of my own.
Thou dull mechanic monster, over-grown!
A type, to draw the gall of Punch's quill,
Of Man's ingenious folly, ill-used skill,
Waste power, and squandered wealth! Still grows the pace
In the great Iron Handicap: a race
Cruel and ruinous, void of grace or credit.
Is one thing sadly certain—must we head it?
[Exit, to ask the Public that question.
Poetry and Prose.
TffE electric wire is occasionally poetical. A recent telegram from
"Madrid, announcing that KING ALFONSO, the PRINCE or WALES, and
the DUKE OF CONNATIGHT had driven, without escort, over the Retire
in a carriage-and-four, added—" The city wore a gay and brilliant
aspect." This Court-prose-poet might, as he " struck the wire," have
gone on— « jjis Majesty and their Imperial Highnesses
The garb of Royal life."
GONE WRONG!
A NEW NOVEL. BY MISS RHODY DENDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh Doicn like a Shower," "Red in the Nose is She,"
"Good t Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, But don't Tell."
CHATTER IX.— TfJtat Jenny says.
WITH one shrill species of shriek she flew for bare life, as if ten
thousand Bulls of Bedlam were behind her, until, completely spent
with her violent exertions, she fell down on the floor of the room
where 1 am seated, playing the piano, panting, gasping, convulsive,
heaving, while the waves of rich carmine that that mad, wild run
has brought into her cheeks, are at ebb-tide now, leaving nothing
but the grey, white, solid sand of her marble face blanched with
fear as surely as if
"in terror of the Sun-God,
Whose steeds run curbless o'er our Southern France,
The young Aspiirngus turns yellow-white,
And quits its bed to meet tho market-knife."
Or, as the King of ancient Roman poets, and model of so many
modern lyricists, has so feelingly said,
"0 puer Asparagus! dea migratfi ante soliiit."
I am playing the piano while the others are dancing: being the
eldest sister and the plainest, it is my rule, in life to play the piano
while others sire dancing.
The scene is changed. It is no longer Wollum. We are at our
merry widow'd sister's house in Stuffordshire, and it is into the
drawing-room of her house that BELLA comes and falls down
exhausted after her long run.
Only one person, besides myself, notices her as she lies in her
rose-coloured dressing-gown prone on the rich yellow carpet, her
poor red eyes sparkling, and a quivering tremor about her mouth,
as she stretches out her desolate white arms, swimming through a
sea of troubles—onlvone person sees this—it is our Cousin, OKLISS
GWTNNIN. He is leaning lazily against a door-post, looking very
handsome, with his large, indolent, reproachful, sky-blue eyes,
while the gas-light catches his yellow hair: but of this he takes no
sort of notice, so sleepy and loungy is he, except to explain to me,
that " he does not mind any gaslight catching his hair, as he is
heavily insured;"—which explanation gives me every possible satis-
faction,—and lights up his sunny soft young moustache, so bright,
so slight, that it seems more as if he had been sucking some sweet
Seville Orange, and had left the strong trace of the rich golden-
tinted blood, in its pipful veins, than that flossy, downy hair should
be springing up about that handsome mouth, as spring flowers, or
drooping, bright-eyed reeds, will grow on the side of a bright, green,
sleepy, deep, well-like ditch.
He has been listening to, or rather, enduring, my playing slow
jigs, brisk minuets, valses d quatre temps, stately cancans, courtly
boleros, and voluptuous Roger de Coverleys, for three hours, without
an interval of refreshment, and I am beginning to feel a little
tired. Still there is a chance, even for me—the eldest, plainest,
and most utterly uninteresting of the ST. JOHN VILLARS family—as
long as our Cousin ORLISS GWYNNIN, the gay, lounging, butterfly
bachelor, is willing to sit in the same room with me without actually
going to sleep, as is the practice of most English gentlemen when
they hear sweet music.
ORLISS is laughing with good-humoured, boyish heartiness at
something he has just been saying to himself, when BELLA rushes
in as I have described, and falls on the floor.
"Good Heavens!" I exclaim—being the ugly woman of the
family, I invariably make use of the plainest expression—" what is
the matter't Is it all over?"
"No," she answers (drily) "not all over yet" (looking up sud-
denly at ORLISS, and laughing violently), " not half begun, I should
say (very indistinctly, and colouring violently, while the Wood in
ORLISS'S face mounts up to his deep, blue-lined temples). "Play,
play, PLAT! and"—she adds, gruffly—"if possible play until you
leave off. Do you hear?"
I hear, and obey, as I always do. And so JEHNY plays on.
OHLISS regards her attentively as he strokes the silky gold of his
moustache. Then his broad chest heaves, and his wide, light-blue-
Cambridge eyes glisten with a passionate excitement, as, struggling
with the strong emotion that the sight of those beautiful appealing
eves has aroused in his innermost being, he bites his lips till they
bleed again.
ORLISS is a splendid handsome idiotic man, an innocent cherubic
yet stalwart beauty. BELLA felt that even if the old love had left
her, here at least might be one good enough to go on with pro tern.,
and perhaps, at some future time, to go on with, also pro tern. But
these were lightning flashes of hope in her dark nights of storm,
misery, and undying grief.
The young man is trembling with the involuntary yehemence of
his own thoughts, as, in a voice sharpened and roughened by the
very intensity of his self-restraint, he spoke—

COVERT COMPLIMENTS.
(THE LAST OF THE SEASON.)
.
Captain Skirler (patronisingly). "HAW, Miss FENCER, so OLAD TO SEE YOU OUT TO-DAY. SAW YOU oo BATTLING WELL THAT LAST
DAY AT EVEHALLOW."
Miss Fencer (promptly). " Ws ALWAYS oo WHERE THERE is GOING. BUT "—(siceetly)—" I DARE SAY YOU DON'T OFTEN SEE us!!"
"Will you marry me to-morrow?" asked ORLISS, violently
clenching his hands until the nails disappeared in the palms and
came out distinct, firm, and visible at the back, while his teeth
closed hard on his upper lip.
She was dreamily thinking of Wollum and the seashore, and is
not attending to him.
"Answer me!" he cried, an agony of indignant perspiration
breaking out on his clay-white face, and colouring it a rich brown.
'We will be married to-morrow morning early, before the break of
day, won't we?" he asks, stooping his waved gold head over her
and smiling drearily.
"No, we tcon't!" she answered. Then, as if afraid of having
given him too sharp a stab, she added, as if in correction, " At least,
not too early. Let us be married after the break of day. Let the
break of day be married first."
He takes her to his arms, and strains her to his broad, strong,
heaving bosom. Then he seizes her slender wrists, but she breaks
away from him, and smiles once more on the floor.
I have ceased to play, but the guests, who had never cared to
listen to me, being ignorant of my having quitted my place at the
piano, are still dancing in the front room.
"Oh Heaven!" BELLA suddenly exclaimed, flinging out her arms,
and then throwing her head down on her knees so recklessly that at
any moment she might have let it drop and so lost it. "If I were
only certain of not suffering to-morrow, I would eat supper now.'"
"What are you talking about?" cries ORLISS, startled and
gravely shocked at this unlooked-for outburst.
But she makes no answer.
"We must dance before we sup," says OHLISS, gaily. "Come
along!" and he flings his happy arms around her. and looking with
fierce beauty into her defiant eyes, as a spasm of joy contracts bis
radiant face, he feels that for the next ten divine, mad minutes of
the quadrille, she is his and his only.
"Come along!" says ORLISS, gaily.
"Don't be a nuisance!" she am we
— answers. "Go away! Va fen!
Allez nous promener.' Allez vout en! Accrochez-le.'"
He accroches it. Yes, OELISS, his broad chest heaving, and his
wide blue eyes glittering with passionate excitement, seizes her
fiercely by her back hair in an access of sudden and uncontrollable
passion; ne presses the souvenir to his lips, and passes out. So Ac
is gone; dismissed, for awhile. Gradually the music ceased; the
guests, hot, weary, flushed, pallid, and straggling, have departed.
BELLA lifts her dreamy, wistful eyes up to me, and holds out the
advertisement sheet of a newspaper.
"Look," she says to me. A Lady-Help is required at once by
Sra GUY FOCKSDAY, of Focksday Hall. I am weary of this kind of
life. I shall go."
And before I can say a word, she has packed up her things, and
gone.
CHAPTER X.— What the Author says.
IT was a cold, dreary November when she arrived at the lodge
gate of Focksday Hall, and walked up the noble avenue towards the
ancient house. It was SIR GUY'S birthday—the fifth of the month;
and the simple-minded, attached peasantry were showing their love
for their old Squire by carrying him in a chair round the grounds,
while they sang pseans of joy suitable to the occasion.
SLR Gur, whose fine old venerable head, set loosely on his
somewhat uneven and stooping shoulders, hung forward on his
breast and harmoniously nodded in time with every movement of
his bearers. His dress, though a comfortable one for an English
Squire, had something of a foreign cut about it, which seemed
scarcely in keeping with the surroundings of the place: his coat,
which showed evident signs of rough, hard work in all kinds of
weathers, was patched, here and there,—with such a variety of un-
blended colours as would have driven GIOTTO wild, and given Tpf-
TORETTO fits,—and had been warmly lined for the inclement, cutting
winter season with clean, warm, supple, sweet-smelling straw, the
ends of which occasionally peeped out, revealing the real interior
luxury of this poor-looking old rag of a garment. His nether man
was defended in a similar manner from the biting North wind; and
his feet, encased in big, easy boots, hung loosely over the chair, so
that the toes turning by that mutual attraction to one another which
is the peculiarity of a certain class of toes, castanetted an accompa-
niment to their slow progress along the grounds. Be it remem-

Loving Husband. "WHAT HAS FATIGUED YOU, MY PirpETYWirpETY POPPET?"
Edith. "OH! I HAVE HAD TO HOLD UP MY PARASOL ALL THE TIME I WAS

A CHANCE FOR "OUIDA."
THE Herzegovinians hare had their Amazon, as most
guerilla armies have had before them. What a heroine
this MADEMOISELLE MERJCUS would make for " QULDA,"
>r the romantic sisterhood who toil after her in vain
through the unwholesome jungles of the improbable and
the improper! A Dutch Creole, born at Java, where she
possesses immense estate», attached to the staff of the
mpronounceable one, LJUBIBRATICS, equipping an insur-
gent squadron at her own expense, out of funds sup-
plied from her chateau and grounds in the neighbourhood
>f Jerusalem! Lovely, accomplished, raven-haired,
wasp-waisted, gazelle-eyed, Diana-limbed, and only
twenty-four years of age, she is all a lady-novelist can
require for a starting-point! There is your heroine.
Stew her down in the stock extracted from a chapter on
liqueurs, a discussion about old china and bric-d-brac,
and the descriptive detail of twenty or thirty dresses by
WORTH; pepper the mixture with quotations from the
naughtiest French novels and the best known Italian
proverbs, with a sprinkling of oaths in as many lan-
guages as can be found room for; and, after letting her
simmer through the proper number of pages with a
Florentine duke, whose limpid eyes dive down to the
soles of her "Hessians "—for she wears male Herze-
sfovinian attire—with a Parisian cocodette for her rival,
dish-up with a garnish of the raciest bits of the last
decade's worst literature, and you have a novel which
would certainly be in hot demand for three weeks at
least among the more reckless subscribers to MUDIK'S
Library—who, in their hunger for excitement, cannot
wait to discriminate the taste of what they swallow, or
the effect of it upon the ravenous devourer.
The Genius of the Ring.
AN excitable Lady, who disapproves of the paternal
and maternal government of the School-Board, being
summoned for not sending her children to school the
other day, suddenly took off her wedding-ring, and
threw it at the head of the sitting Magistrate. MR. BEN-
SOX, the Magistrate at the wicket, dexterously caught the
ring (amid cries of " Well fielded!" by the Clerks), and
proceeded good-humouredly to ask the irascible mother
conundrums which were not calculated to calm her
troubled spirit—" Why did you throw your wedding-
ring at mei"' To which she might have reasonably
replied, "Because it is the first step to a Union." But
she didn't. We are not informed that MB. BENSON told
her that, if she could not take care of her ring, the Court
would be obliged to find her a keeper.
bered that SIR GUY was now a man well stricken in years, and
so it was no wonder that such colour as remained in his white,
glazed-looking, hard features was of a peculiar, rosy, fresh gera-
nium tint; that his eyes were hollow and lack-lustre; that his nose
was sharp, white, and meaningless; and, as SIR GUY was still a
great smoker, it would have been a matter of unfeigned astonish-
ment to his friends had they seen him without the short clay pipe
which was now stuck, in a careless fashion, into his bar-slit, tooth-
less mouth, whose hard, shrivelled, yet brown-pink lips, held the
pipe-stem with a fixed pressure: nor would they have evinced less
surprise had they met him without the bunch of wooden matches, or
pipe-lights, which he carried, negligently, in one curved, powerless
hand, while, in the other—being old-fashioned, and not caring to
muddle himself up with new-fangled inventions—he held a lantern,
with a lighted candle within. It was this vision of
"A fine Old English Gentleman,
One of the olden time,"
that met BELLA'S gaze as she crossed the avenue, and entered the
side-path.
"SIR GUY seems beloved—though, no doubt, he is eccentric," she
thought to herself; "but I may be happy here."
Seeing a stranger approaching, SIK GUY bade his bearers set him
down somewhere away, among the laurel-bushes, or in the tool-shed,
or any quiet corner, so that he might he out of the way when the
supposed visitor called—as is the fashion with fine old English hos-
pitable gentlemen when thev ought to be present to receive a guest.
So the good, snub-nosed, Sabbath-clothed peasants, singing
"Please to remember
The Fifth of November,"
turned the chair over in among the laurel-bushes, and walked away,
leaving SIR GUY to watch the effect upon the caller when one of his
powdered, canary-coloured Colossi should open the hall-door, and
I sav "Not at home!" in answer to the first simple inquiry.
But Fate willed it otherwise; and the visitor was not to inquire
at that door yet awhile.
Her curiosity partially aroused by what she had seen, BELLA
crossed the garden-walk. Fatigued with her walk, for a moment
she sits down on a rough-hewn bench.
I do not believe in coincidences generally; but I believe in this
coincidence, because it exactly fits into this present situation, and
helps us along.
As she sighed, she heard the roll of wheels upon a gravel-path,
and two voices—a man's and a woman's.
The woman's said, lackadaisically—and yet why should she lack-
a-daisy where so many grew?—"Carry Floss: she's rheumatic,
and the ground is rather too damp."
"Yes, my Lady."
At that man's voice BELLA started so violently that she tilted the
seat, backwards, right in among the laurel and rhododendron
shrubs, and so—fortunately for her—disappeared from view as there
passed, right in front of where she had but the moment before been
seated, a Lady in a Bath-chair, wheeled by a tall servant in a
splendid livery, carrying a little fat, wheezing, silk-eared dog, that
had seen its best days among the snows of St. Bernard in the Isles
of Newfoundland.
BELLA, completely concealed by the friendly bushes, was able to
concentrate her whole attention on the Lady, while the face of her
male attendant was turned away.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

GREAT MEETING AT THE ZOOLOGICAL
GARDENS.
Good Friday, taking ad-
vantage of the closing of
the Gardens, a Meeting
of the most influential of
DR. SCLATER'S boarders
was convened for the pur-
pose of considering the
arrangements to he made
for the reception at the
Gardens of the animals
Presented to H.R.H. the
KIKCK OF WALES during
his Indian progress.
On the motion of the
Senior Lion present, se-
conded hy Chunee, the Big
Elephant, the Royal and
Imperial Bengal Tiger was
called to the Chair.
The Chairman said: No
doubt the Meeting was
aware of the fact that His
Royal Highness had in the
course of his Indian tour
received more — a good
many more—zoological gifts from the Rajahs, Maharajahs, Rams,
Jams, Guikwars, Peishwas, Nawaubs, and other potentates of
India, than he knew what to do with. The synonym for the most
embarrassing and unwelcome of gifts that could be made was
a "white elephant"—no offence to their most respectable paehv-
dermatous comrade of darker complexion, who, he was sure, would
always be a welcome present, under any circumstances. These
half-civilised Indian rulers—his family had known something about
them in earlier days—were apparently under the impression that
there were no tigerSj lions, elephants, panthers, cheetahs, or hears
in this country—(derisive howls, roars, grunts, growls, and squeaks
from the, company)—but what was the fact? The uncivilised ani-
mals which had been shipped on board the Scrapis and the JKtiteigh—
for, literally, the animals nad had to come over in two ships, like the
famous Monkey in the comic song—were no more to be compared to
the animals born, or at least educated, in those Gardens, than the
street Arab of the back slums could be compared with the highly
cultivated Graduate of Oxford or Cambridge. The question before
them was, should this fact bo acknowledged and acted upon, or
ignored? Should the new-comers he received with the attentions
due to distinguished foreigners, the deference that should always
he paid to Royal property, or the COD! and contemptuous indifference
that was the natural demeanour of civilised beings towards mere
illiterate and uncultivated—he might say savage—intruders on the
happy and highly-trained family-party which he saw around him?
The Indian Elephant, beins- loudly called upon, trumpeted to the
effect that he flattered himself he knew something about Elephants,
something about England, and something about India. He must
say that he felt as if he never could look an Illustrated London
JN etcs or a Graphic in the face again, after the glut of Elephants
they had inflicted on the public during the tour of His Royal High-
ness. If the Prince was as sick of Elephants as the public must be,
he feared the popularity of his family had received a blow from
which it never would recover. There could be such a thing as even
too much Elephant. (Cries of" JVp, no ! ") It was now twenty-five
years since ho had packed up his trunk for his journey to this
country. Since then he had led a quiet and happy, though somewhat
monotonous, life. It was easier, if less exciting work, carrying a
howdah-load of children than a fat Rajah or his harcem, or a sporting
Sahib with his breech-loaders; and he would rather make the
acquaintance of his distinguished friend in the Chair through the
burs of the Carnivora-house than at closer quarters on his own
flank, or with his (the Elephant's) trunk in his (the Tiger's) claws.
He would say nothing of the effects of a diet composed largely of
stale buns and questionable gingerbread. Luckily, his digestion
was pretty strong. But he Knew the British Public. It liked
novelty, it liked T^ions—no allusion to his feline friends—and it
liked Foreigners—if a little savage, so much the better. Look at
the way it ran after the SHAH. He was quite prepared to find his
friend the B. P. going into raptures over the new-comers, if only
because they knew no English and had never tasted a bun in their
lives. He did not mean to allow his trunk to be put out of joint by
any such ignorant intruders, though they came from the stud of the
mightv RAM-JAM JELLYBOY, the original BANDEBSSATCH, or the
great PANJANDRUM himself. He, for one, would take care that the
Superintendent, Fellows, and Visitors knew HIS sentiments on the
subject. If these strangers were thrust upon the established
animals, let the public look out, he would not say for squalls, but
for trumpets, to a pretty lively tune, and a smash to follow. He
did not think his howdah would be the safest place for hopeful hoys
home for the holidays if the rumoured intention was persisted in.
Jenny, the Ourang-Outan, after apologising for the weak state of
her voice, owing to chronic bronchitis—these East winds were really
cruel—put it to the Meeting, if this was the sort of weather
poor animals ought to expect so near May-Day. She would only
remind them, that the attraction of their less civilised brethren
would draw more nuts and buns.
The Chairman growled out that he didn't see what nuts and buns
had to do with it. If she had said ribs of beef, he could have under-
stood the observation.
The Ourang-Outan apologised, and for the rest of the meeting sat
pensively nibbling the Larger Ant-Eater's tail, but said no more.
The Polar Bear quite agreed with his pachydermatous friend (the
Elephant). He had no liking for Jndia, which he considered a
nasty, hot, disagreeable country, with not an iceberg or a glacier to
be had for love or. money, without travelling as far as the great
Himalayan range. He did not expect to find any of his kith or kin
among the new-comers, and had no disposition to admit relationship
with the diminutive and vegetable-eating Himalayan Bears who, he
understood, would he represented among them.
The Brown Bear of Europe begged to say " ditto" to his Polar
cousin. He did not believe in Indian gifts either. He might have
his own views about—some might say upon—India, hut all he would
say at that Meeting was that his motto had been, and should always
be, "Bear and for-Bear." They had heard of "the Lion's share"
long enough. He hoped the time was now coming for the Bear's
share to be meted out to him. He did not see what they wanted
with more animals, except for the commissariat department. All
he could say was, that, if they came, he was willing to do his best to
see them taken in and done for.
The Lion remarked that if he had changed his quarters lately, he
was still the Old Lion. He had asked his Royal and Imperial
friend to take the Chair, to show that he did not envv him his new
title. He preferred old names himself, and would remain the
original British Lion so long known, and ho hoped he might add, so
deservedly popular, in those Gardens. Ho thought the less we had
of Indian titles, or of Indian visitors, the better.
The Royal and Imperial Bengal Tig_er wished to know if the
British Lion had any intention of reflecting on him, or his family or
title, hv that remark?
The British Lion declined to explain.
The Tiger on this began to growl, and the Meeting was much
agitated for some moments, when, luckily, the Keepers coming up,
got the animals coaxed to their respective dens, and the bars were
secured on the Carnirora without mischief, though without any
distinct expression of the feeling of the Meeting.
(POSSIBLE) MAY MEETINGS, 1870.
MK. DISRAELI may meet with a good reason for his newly-acquired
Imperialism—better at least than those furnished by his favourite
almanack and little girl.
Mn. GLADSTONE may meet with something fresh to disestablish—
with MR. DISRAELI'S assistance.
DR. KEXEALY may meet with some oue who believes him the heir
of all the Plantagenets, a greater orator than DUJIOSTHENES, and a
juster man than ARISTIDES.
MR. WHALLET may meet with a simpler victim of delusion than
himself.
Ma. NEWDEGATE may meet with a nunnery that will receive him
with open arms.
The SULTAN and the KHEDIVE may meet with some one able to
show them a new way to pay old debts.
The Armies of the EMPKUOR OF RUSSIA may meet with the word
"EMPRESS " chalked on a board somewhere in Asia, and retreat into
Europe with precipitation.
The two giant Iron-dads Aeronaut and Dicing Belle may meet,
and prove MR. WAKD HUNT'S prevision in christening them.
MR. SwiNiitTRNE may meet with a poet equal to himself—even in
his own opinion.
The Home-Rulers and Nationalists may meet, without having to
be parted by the Police.
Christians of different denominations may meet without cursing
each other.
The House of Commons may meet with the serious intention of
doing useful work.
Mr. Punch may meet with an Upper Ten and a Lower Ten
Million, none of whom deserve his satiric lash.
PAINTERS, whose Pictures have been sent back for want of
room, must be pleased to learn that the Royal Academy has had a
STOREY added to it.

about Irish Peers—the country is not to
have any more of them. So far the
House of Lords agree with LORD
INCIIIQUIN. The rest of the Bill—as
far as 7>M/!c/i.can"understand—has gone to the dogs. No. Irish boroughs may
yet have the'chance given them of being represented by Irish Peers. Who dares
say England never does anything for Ireland?
(Commons.) — Merchant Shipping again. Government Clause carried to
prohibit deck-loads of heavy timber, or of light timber above three feet high,
between October and March. MB. PLIMSOLL was within eight of getting timber
deck-loads prohibited altogether. Bravo. PLIMSOLL! This shows the good
of "pegging away," even in the teeth of a stonewall; nay, against what is
worse than any number of stonewalls, such a feather-bed fender as ADLERLEY'S
puzzle-pate stuffed with good intentions.
Tuesday (Lords).—First cry over spilt milk—of which we are promised more
to come. LORD SELBORNE stated, elaborately and emphatically, his grounds
for contending that Ministers, after promising to "localise" the QUEEN'S
Imperial Title, by their Proclamation, have kept the word of '' honour to the ear,
and broken it to the sense," by localising the title of Queen in England, and
giving the title of Empress everywhere else in the British dominions.
"No." says the LORD CHANCELLOR. "The Proclamation applies only to
cases where the QUEEN'S full title has to be used. It provides that the new
title shall not be used in those cases, where they relate to England only. That
is what /undertook we would do, and that is what we have done."
LORD HATHERLEY (ex-Lord Chancellor) compactly puts the question, as
between LORD SELBORNE and LORD CAIBNS—which will next week be the ques-
tion between MR. DISRAELI and SIR H. JAMES, between Her Majesty's Govern-
ment and Her Majesty's Opposition, between the Majority and the Minority:—
"Did the promise to localise the title mean spreading it over every part of the
Empire except England?"
Now our readers know exactly the point at issue. It could not have been
better put than by LORD SELBORNE, or more clearly, and weakly, met than by
LORD CAIRNS. Between them we know the best that can be said for, and the
worst that can be said against, Government. And bad is the best.
(Meanwhile, it is a comfort to know that if Municipalities Kotow, it will be
because they like it. SIR BERNARD BUEKE, Ulster King-at-Arms, told the
Corporation of Dublin that in their Address to the QUEEN on the return of the
PRINCE OP WALES, they must approach her by the new style. "Nothing of the
kind!" says the HOLKER. in his off-hand way. "Bother SIR BERNARD!'
Bo BURKE is Burked! The Ulster King-at-Arms mav put the HOLEER'S flat
contradiction in his pipe—if Kings-at-Arms have such low things—and smoke
it—if Kings-at-Arms do such low things.)
(Commons.)—MR. DISRAELI explained to Sin H. JAMES that of course in
Commissions the new title must be used, as they operated
all over the world—in India as elsewhere.
"Investigation of Titles" has always been the raw of
our Land-Transfer law. It promises soon to be as awk-
ward and as sore a point in the Legislation, as in the
Law, of the land. What a crop of questions must be
growing out of the Proclamation for the Law Officers,
from the LORD CHANCELLOR down!
The Government grants SIB H. HAVELOCK a Select
Committee to inquire how berths in the Civil Service can
be found for meritorious members of the Military and
Naval dittos, after discharge. But MR. HARDT declines
to turn the War-Office into a Registration-Office.
PETER TAYLOR, that Don Quixote of doubtful cases
and desperate causes, laid bare for the second time the
backs of the two small boys whom MR. WILBERFORCE,
taking the law and the stick into his own hands,
thrashed, ripe parent-is, and has thereby earned, and
got, a lecture from the Losp CHANCELLOR on the danger
of Magistrates allowing their Eton experience of flogging
and its blessed effects to carry them too far. MR. TAYLOB,
after a statement of the case, in that peculiarly strong
language which anything that he views as oppression
always provokes him to,—so much must he said to the
credit of his heart, if not his head—asked to have ME.
WILBEBFOECE dismissed from the Bench.
The House agreed with SIR W. BARTTEIOT that the
Magistrate's error of judgment had been sufficiently
punished, and that "wigging" might fairly be set
against "whipping"—particularly as MB. W. had had
to pay £15 damages, at which rate the indignant parent
would probably be delighted to have his rabbit-hunting
offspring flogged every week in the year.
MR. C. LEWIS called the RIGHT HON. E. LOWE over
the coals for his after-dinner story at Retford, that two
Ministers, to whom the QUEEN had made the proposal,
had declined to bring in a Bill empowering her to add
to her title.
MR. LOWE having first answered ME. LEWIS'S letter,
giving notice of his intention to ask the question, as he
used to answer deputations, by a snub including a sneer,
tried to repeat the process in his speech, and so laid
himself open to such a double-thonging from MR. DIS-
RAELI, as the House has not had the pleasure of seeing
administered for many a long day, followed bv a denial
of MR. LOWE'S statement on the part of HER MAJESTY—
a real Queen's Message. The House received the mes-
sage with respect, the castigation with relish. On no
back could the lash have been laid so entirely to the
House's satisfaction. BEN thrashing BOB, BOB having
richly deserved it, is only less delightful than it will be
to see BOB return the compliment to BEN when he gets
the chance.
Arcades ambo,
Scarificare pare?, et pay-back-re parati.
Wednesday.—Bill to assimilate Irish Registration to
English. Ireland being so like England in all other
respects, why should it not be like her also in this?
Strange the House can't see the absurdity, but persists
in throwing out the Bill by 203 to 118.
Thursday (Commons).—MR. Lowz, having taken
council of his pillow, and his friends—he hat friends—
apologised humbly and fully for his Retford lese-majeste.
It would have been inexcusable in him to repeat the
story if false; still more inexcusable, if true. The
QUEEN'S name should not be dragged into debate, for
the QUEEN is the only person in England who cannot
open her mouth in her own defence.
After MR. LOWE had administered the discipline to
himself with a heavy hand, MR. LEWIS got up to improve
the occasion, but the House was not of a humour for MB.
LEWIS'S " improvement," and shut him up sharply. MR.
LEWLS had better be warned by the fate of MR. LOWE.
SIB HENRY JAMES gave notice of his intention to
move a Resolution that the Proclamation under the
Royal Titles Bill does not make adequate provision for
localising the title of Empress.
MR. DISRAELI, accepting the motion as at once a vote
of no confidence and censure, put that tlay week at SIB
HENRY'S service. So on Thursday the llth, the Crown
will again be thrown up for a kick off, a "rooge," and
a "bully," though there can be no doubt, considering
the strength of the sides, which will carry the goal.
But irnt the Crown meant for a foot-ball?

ships'-boats, and advance-notes in hand. The President of the
Board of Trade threw a new light on the dangers and disadvan-
tages of ships'-boats.
"Suppose a ship wrecked in the middle of the Atlantic, with all the life-
boats and deck raft* propo»ed by the clause on board, and that all the passen-
gers were lowered safely; what would become of them? They would simply
be starved, and die by inches, instead of being drowned in the ship."
Of boats, said MAJOR BEBESFORD (as of wounds in the old play,
according to the well-known JOE MILLER),
"The danger"s great, because they are so small."
Sra CHABLES retorts (as smartly as the Wag in the gallery),—
"It would be far less, were there none at all."
Ought not the new Shipping Bill contain a provision that no ship
carry boats, as a precaution against lingering death in cases of
ship-wreck? On Scurvy we are glad to hear that a Committee
is sitting. "We wish it a close and searching inquiry, and to
MB. BATES, and all the other owners of scurvy-smitten ships^ a
good deliverance. Poor MB. BATES! With all the ship-owning
virtues under the sun, he is so unlucky as to be under the necessity
—which must be painful to a truly modest mind like his—of per-
petually blowing his own trumpet. What is MR. BATES to do if the
sailors aboard his ships won't eat preserved vegetables, and will eat
"slush?" Then again, MR. BATES believes Advance-notes to be
essential to the well-being of the British Seaman; but perverse
Committees, both of Ship-owners and the House of Commons, will
report against them as demoralising to the Seaman, and of service
only to the crimp and the class of owners whose trust is in crimps.
BATES in the character of Antagonizes again!
Friday (Lnrds).—LORD DE LA WARE uttered a wail a propos of
the wicked School Boards, which are dragging us into the slough
of despond, of a purely, or impurely. Secular Education! He wants
to have the burning question of Primary Education handled in
the Lords before going to the Commons, who are sure.to scorch their
fingers over it. The DUKE OF RICHMOND did not see his way to
this. Educators must put their hands into the public pocket, and
that was a privilege reserved for the Commons.
Oxford University Bill read a Third Time.
(Common*.)—Last night the House was loud on the Seaman's
Advance-note in our seaports. To-night it is as hot over the Russian
Advance-note in Central Asia.
MB. BAJLLIE COCHBANE dragged the double-headed eagle on the
tapis. We ought to look on the Russian advance towards Merv as
the rise of a tide on our Indian frontier.
(Has MR. COCHBANE ever heard of CAXUTE and his courtiers?
Tides rise by laws of nature. Are Russians in Central Asia ad-
vancing so? Better drop the tide metaphor.)
MR. FORSYTE admits that the Bear is swallowing the Khanates;
but all the better for the Khanates. The Bear is a blessing—in
disguise, perhaps, but still a blessing. Central Asians can only be
civilised by absorption. There is no danger to our frontier from the
side of Khokand and Kashgar. Our street-doors are the Khyber
Pass (cid Cabul) and the Bholan Pass (via Kandahar). Herat is the
key of both. So long as we can keep Afighanistan between us and
Russia we are all right. Let us stick to SHEBE AM, and stand no
nonsense in the way of any stretching of the Bear's paws towards
Merv—for Merv is only 240 miles from Herat, and wten the Russ
takes Herat, he may say "erat" of the Anglo-Indian Empire—
"There was one once." (" Fuit" would be better Latin, but what
would become of the pun ?)
SIR G. CAMPBELL agreed in the main with MB. FOBSITH. Russia
might become a dangerous neighbour. She was not so yet. Our
best wisdom was to keep our eyes open and our powder dry—not
trust her an inch further than we can see her, but not irritate her
by perpetual expressions of distrust.
SIR H. HAVELOCK was of opinion that the Indian deluge would be
upon us in five years; and that our Ark, the Anglo-Indian Army,
was rotten.
MR. DISRAELI had no faith in understandings. (He has educated
too many.) He saw no reason why Russia should not follow her
natural law of development, provided England gave her clearly
to understand that we were determined to strengthen our Indian
Empire materially and morally, and always to claim our legitimate
influence in the East. Frankness was better than "silent BUS-

WHY in the world should the question arise?
la the course that bright-winged Pegasus flies
To be measured by means mechanic?
There's a power and passion that urge to write,
And the energy fills with strong dulight,
That moves the natural easy might
Of a genius Titanic.
As the war-horse neighs in the battle-hour,
So the spirit of fire, the wielder of power,
Works on, and in strength rejoices.
Better his visions than fortune or fame;
To spend himself is his glorious aim;
He can wait for Posterity's sure acclaim,
If grudged the multitude's voices.
The fickle taste of the thoughtless town
May wrongly assign the laurel crown:
Why should that spoil life's flavour?
Destiiiy works on a curious plan,
And is often kind to the charlatan;
But the man who has power is the happy man,
Whoever has Fortune's favour.

ATALANTA IN ENGLAND.
MR. POYNTKB'S s;<-
firrb picture Mr. Punch
Moralises—
A HAPPY loss! And not
the only race
In which the fair sex
fairly wins by losing.
Fleetiicss 'gainst force!
The nymph should
have the pace
Over a pleasant course
of her own choosing.
But in a pounding, long
cross-country spin.
When way and weather
make it heavy going,
Who 'd back those flying
rosy feet to win?
I'd rather see them
flowing
Through a waltz-measure,
than besplashed with
mire
On that rude course where
e'en male .roadsters
tire.
Meilanionhas it!" Yes, by sleight, not speed,"
Grumbles in Punch's car a phantom BECKER.
Could woman e'er run straight? Doubtful indeed!
That golden globe you see has power to check her
Midway a winning race. Dame Venus knew
More of her mind than MILL. That fruit's a symbol
Of things no woman, blaze she bright in blue,
Or meekly ply a thimble,
Could e'er be trusted to resist. While partial
To the marital, she enjoys the martial.
Fight? Yes, like Tomyris! But fight they fair.
Who war 'gainst nature, feeling, and affection r—
Given a tribe of BECKERS, trained with care,
By natural, or unnatural, selection,
For ages to judicial poise, the last
Who crowned your model species could no more
Resist love's lure in judgment's race-course cast,
Than she who ran of yore
For Woman's Rights in Ancient Greece could grapple
With the temptation of that golden apple.
Alas, dear LYDIA! It is all too late
To change the gentler sex in soul or stature.
With sheer unfitness—worse than extra weight—
Woman, thank Heaven, is handicapped by Nature.
Enter her for the great Political Stakes,
A race in which few men 'scape slip or stumble!
Sweet LYDIA, 'tis the maddest of mistakes.
No surer way to humble
Thy justest pride of sex. Before beginning,
Pray calculate what she might lose by winning!
"Mere selfish sentiment"? No spouter. Punch,
Of pinchbeck chivalry as poor and hollow
As SMOLLETT'S satyr-satire. By his hunch,
Lay Woman's weal that way, he 'd lead—not follow—-
The New Crusade! But say she wins the race,
Our Atalanta—not the Arcadian, surely,
But latter-day Boeotian—place ana grace
Which now she holds securely
As a non-combatant, are hers no longer,
Whom only weakness e'er can make the stronger.
Trust Punch, though maidens may be ne'er so fast,
Life's race-course, is not woman s road to glory.
OLYHENE'S fleet-foot daughter failed at last,
And, when she won, her tropliies were all gory.
Pardon the word, c'est male, and most unpleasant
Like others masculine and militant:
How shape them to your sex's lips? At present
Punch must confess he can't!
Gain's loss, when sex with sex for mastery grapples;
Best waive the race, and share the golden apples!
ACADEMY ECHOES.
"How do? So glad to see you." "Umbrellas and sticks to be

TIGHT FISH.
PERHAPS the audience at the Royal Institution the other Friday evening
included SIB WILFRID LAWSON. If so, a portion at least of a lecture delivered
by ME. G. J. ROMANES, on the "Physiology of the Nervous System of the Me-
dusse," must have captivated him. It is reported as follows. On those animals—
"Many experiments were tried to test the effect of poisons, or what are poisons to
most vertebrates. The actions were almost identical. Alcohol produced all the successive
stages of intoxication, from irregularity of swimming to hilarity of motion and final
comatose sleep, which was always recovered by a night's rest. The lecturer regretted
he had not tried the restorative effects of soda-water "—
And perhaps of pick-me-up. A man addicted to liquor is sometimes said to
drink like a fish, which is just what such persons do not, though the compulsory
Teetotallers do their best to make them. From the foregoing account, however,
it appears probable that fishes in common with most vertebrates can be affected
by poisons, including alcohol, and that jelly-fishes, though not vertebrate, were
actually intoxicated with it. Salt water is, of course, the strongest beverage of
"Fishes that tipple in the deep."
They " know no such liberty" as that of which SIR WILFRID and his asso-
ciates seek to deprive their neighbours. It is only by scientific experiment
that philosophers can ascertain how fishes, usually water-drinkers, behave
under the influence of spirits and water. They prove, it appears, unable to
swim straight, they roll and tumble about, and finally become senseless. In
this condition it might puzzle a Policeman, taking up a hsh, to discern if it were
drunk or dying. The "Talking Fish" some time ago exhibited was if not a
fish still a "vertebrate." If a talking fish were made tipsy, how would it
talk? As inarticulately, no doubt, as a Lord of the Creation, not to say a Chris-
tian in like case. In short, it seems that fishes behave exactly as human beings
do when half-seas-over. In that state they might, like the Spartan Helots,
be utilised as ridiculous examples. But really, is not experimenting on animals
•with intoxicating liquors as shocking as vivisection?
A MONDAY NIGHT'S DREAM.
A Fantasia. Composed and dedicated to his friend
MR. ARTHUR. S. CHAFPELL, by his ever grateful
friend, Mr. Punch.
(THERE is no evident reason why this very original
and most fascinating composition should be styled
"Fantasia" any more than the other grand compositions
of the same Master. That it is constructed in a wholly
independent manner, and that each movement shows a
certain fantastic character, is true. To analyse the so-
called "Fantasia" in detail would occupy more space
than can be afforded; but a brief quotation from each of
the principal themes will suffice to call attention to the
character and plan of each successive movement.— Our
Own Analytical Programmist.)
Iittrodiizionc—Allegretto.
A winter evening, and a spacious room,
A creeping fog, and a mysterious gloom—
No sight or sound that hints the picturesque—
A brass-bound piano, and 'a fiddler's desk.
Ladies sitting at their knitting,
Or chatting o'er their tatting;
The vast amphitheatre filling,
Modest votaries of the shilling,
And the tardy stalls, up-driving,
Just in nick of time arriving.
Now the gas bursts into brightness
And each heart leaps up in lightness,
Wliile a fiddle's distant flourish warns each wayward
sound to stop.
Do you ask me what's to-night meant
By this flutter of excitement P
'Tis the Hall of Great St. James's. We are at a Monday
Pop.
Andante Cantabile.
When the soul with sorrow laden
Finds no answer to its moan
In the jocund voice of HAYDN,
Or MOZART'S pellucid tone;
When our SCHUBERT'S cunning lyre
Fails to draw us at its will,
And the deeps of our desire
E'en BEETHOVEN cannot still;
When the mists that bound things human
We have sought to pierce in vain,
Then we turn to thee, 0 SCHUMANN,
Bid thee sing to us our pain.
Scherzo e trio.
ftuartett in A minor—
Sure nothing is finer,
And no one e'er heard a performance diviner:
For strength and for neatness,
For purity, sweetness,
And all that is blent in the joy of eorapletenes=.
Finale. Presto agitato con brio.
Now with all the speed they can,
All four playing like one man:
And a rapture half-divine
Steeps the senses, as in wine!
JOACHIM, ZEHBINI, STRAUSS—
Steadfast pillars of the house;
JOACHIM, PIATTI, HIES—
Where are players like to these?
And SIR Jumrs, their chief,
With his laurel, green of leaf.
To your sovereign long be loyal,
Children of the CHApPELL-Royal.
Should you fail us but for one day,
"Transit gloria " of that "Monday."
Let them cry from every steeple
We 're no music-loving people-
While we 're drawn from every part
By the magic of MOZART;
While two thousand souls are cloven
By the beauty of BEETHOVEN—
They may call us what they will;
We will come and listen still!

DEAR native! He measured six inches across,
And he whistled in answer to me.
Where'er shall I find, to make up for his loss,
So unselfish a shell-fish as he!
Spite of dredgers destructive he clung to the bed
Whereof from the spat he was reared,
And a true native lived, though he still, it was said,
Like a foreigner breathed through his beard.
How he sang, my brave bivalve! Molluscous of throat,
He could run up his scales clean to C,
A true Oyster-Patti—he reached as high note,
Though not quite as high L. S. D,
But one day my sweet native was torn from his bed,
A bran-new Aquarium to grace,
Where being the first to arrive, the red-lead
Of the glaziers' work settled his case!
My mollusc, he died in a week, sad to tell,
Leaving me, his best friend, to repine;
And FRANK BUCKLASD'S kind hand closed him up in his shell,
And embalmed him in spirits of wine!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A CRUEL CLAUSE.
'All the Ladies 'twixt forty and sixty
Said,' Oh, what a nwect pretty plan!'"
Meditcral Hi/inn.
WEET MR. PUNCH,
I AM a girl
'twixt "sixteen
and forty." I
have always
fondly loved the
Clergy of my
native Isle, and
my highest am-
bition has been
to wed one of
those dear
Bishops, who
wear such loves
of long frocks
and little darling
aprons. Judge
then of my just
indignation on
hearing that the
Synod of Ireland
have actually
obliged us to
carry weight for
age] in the race
for the Matrimonial Sweep-stakes, and have gone in for the Old
Trots.
"CHURCH OP IRELAND GENERAL SYNOD.
"The House assembled ut one o'clock yesterday. The BISHOP OF DOWN
presiding. The House proceeded to the orders of the day.
"MR. NI-NX moved the House go into Committee on his Bill to establish a
plan for making provision for Widows and Orphans of Clergy.
"The following clauses were considered :—
"1. The Widow of every Clergyman, at the time of his death in the service
of the Church of Ireland, or if he shall have been permitted to retire, shall
receive an annuity of £33 a year, to cease absolutely on re-marriage, subject
to the following conditions:—
"(a) The husband at the time of his first appointment to a benefice or
curacy in the Church of Ireland, being under forty years of age and un-
married, or a widower without family.
"(A) At time of marriage being under sixty years of age.
"(e) ?fot more than tu'enty-fve years older than his \cife."
I remain, dear Mr. Punch, yours always,
SWEET SEVENTEEN.
P.S.—Do abuse these naughty men, there's a dear old love.

GONE WBONG!
A NEW NOVEL. BY MISS RHODY DBNDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh Down like a Shower," "Red in the Nose is She,"
"Qoodt Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, But don't Tell."
CHAPTER XL— What the Author says.
A TALI woman, silk-and-velvet skirted, with serpentine-trailing
garments sweeping amply round her; a woman not old, not young,
not middle-aged; neither all here nor all there; a mistress of arts
and graces. Diana being taken to her morning bathe in her bath
chair, wheeled by a knee-plush-ultra Titan, could not have been
more bewitchingly, more deadlily attractive than this lissom,
undulating empress, whose every movement was a poem—unnatural
if you like, but a triumph of Art over Time, who, bald, ruthless,
envious though he is, has not yet straightened the curving outline of
that Grecian bend—
"Time writes no wriggle on thy azure bow."
And the man? Aye—one with a dark, ugly face; beardless, but
with a deep-toned picturesque, blue, southern shade mantling over
his upper lip and chin—the warm, Mediterranean blue, that was the
glory of FRA ANOELICO'S art—the blue that TITIAN revelled in, and
GIOTTO loved to paint; a man you would infallibly turn to look back
at in the street, if he had struck you in passing. One who
approached more nearly in physical conformation the glorious beauty
of the Hydeparkian Achillest than do most men, whom one sees, and
pities, now-a-days. With sinewy veins for streamlets, and swelling
muscles for rivers, with an incurving canal between two chains of
Pyrenean mountains of shoulders, 'he Vas mapped out Atlas-like
from Northern pole—where the white powder lay like a glory of
arctic snow—to Southern, where there was a wealth of sunny,
golden plush; and. as her eyes fell on him, she felt that never,
except one, had she seen a human form so like the deathless
dying athlete of antiquity, the Gladiator of the Forum, fitted with
faultless taste by some noted West-End tailor, proud of his mission
to clothe so magnificent a being—this Diskobolos of a man, this
Agamemnon in livery, this Enceladus ad ritulos ! *
Yes, it was he, after all, thought the girl, as she cowered and shook
among the laurels. There are not many like him.
Surely she could not have been mistaken?
A piano sounded within the house. The Bath-chair stopped. The
splendid, god-like, statuesque creature in livery ceased to impel it
along the path, and the Lady, with a wave of her hand, dismissed
this canary-clad Colossus of roads.
A window on the ground-floor was suddenly opened, and a pair of
legs appeared over the window-sill, whereat the Lady in the cnair—
the LADY VIRGINIA CREEPER, niece of Sin GUT FOCKSDAY—raised
her fan, and a faint peach-coloured blush passed upward over her
marble-veined throat and smooth, pearl-powdered cheek.
"Were dat you a playing the piano? she asked, with an air of
cold surprise, and the frigid dignity of a Christy Minstrel.
"It were, laughingly replied her cousin, the Hoy. PEECY SnoKT-
WYITD, sliding on to the ground. "I was playing A Major, and so
you didn't expect to see A Captain?"
Her pink-tipped ears went back, and a zebra-like expression came
into the LADY VIRGINIA'S face, as, quitting the chair, she gave a
little kick out behind with her high heels, and replied, with a little,
factitious cough,
'' Xo; knowing it was you, PERCY, I expected to see A Flat."
"Thank you; you are as amiable as usual."
"And vou are duller than usual," retorts the hard, cold beauty,
with ladylike exasperation. "But what does it matter? We are
going to be married very soon!" and pointing two long, shapely,
white fingers, she thrusts them sharply, and with a knowledge of
anatomy, scarcely to be expected of her, beneath her cousin's fifth
rib, then withdraws them as suddenly.
PERCY SHOKTWYND winces as he gasps out, drily, "We are; but
do not do that again."
VIRGINIA smiles, and the bright brooch, and chain of exquisite
Lowther Arcade workmanship, rise and fall in a soft, even, me-
chanical modulation on her Tussaud-like waxen breast.
While they are standing here—a colourless, marble, clean-cut,
immovable, expressionless-featured woman, and a full-toned, under-
sized, short-cut, importable, wide-whiskered man—a loud voice
from the hall breaks upon their silence.
"Here! hi! you! Confound you all! Hang it! dash it! blow
it! Why the doosc—where are those blooming idiots?"
It is old SIR GUY who speaks. He is a real, high-bred, old
country gentleman, and, it being past four o'clock, he is calling
VIRGINIA to give him his brandy-and-water hot, as all high-bred
old English gentlemen invariably do. On leaving the bushes where
he had been niding, he had passed into the hall.t
"Come!" she said to PERCY, who replied to her cold, chaste smile
by placing his hand on his heart, with all the courtliness of the old
school—he resembled his father, SIB GUT, in this respectr—bending
his head nearly down to his toes, and elevating his coat-tails.
The LADY VIRGINIA passed into the house, and disappeared.
PERCY, preparing to follow, caught sight of BELLA as she nastily
r'tted the laurels. One of her glances gave him an odd sensation
ut the midriff, and, not feeling quite well, he staggered into the
house.
"Can I love him?" asked BELLA, of herself, as she stood before
the front door; "and can he love me?" She smiles to herself, as
she places her small hand on the bell-pull, and prepares to make
her first call in her new character of a lady-help in an old English
gentleman's family.
• TTTiat the Editor says.—" Nothing we love so much as classical allusions,
and we feel the greatest possible gratification to witness so much culture in
one of the most talented of the softer sex. But—we own our ignorance on
this particular point, and neither SMITH nor LEMPHIERE has been able to

Trembling she approaches the door, and her feeble fingers were at
the handle, when the portal was flung open, and the same Antinous-
like creature, in all the sunlike glory of bright canary-coloured
plush and silken tags, burst fully on her dazed and misty view.
His foot is on the first step before he perceives her. Then an
electric shock of recognition seems to shoot through him, convulsing
his herculean frame with overpowering force, and he jumps clean
out of his shining shoes—out of his splendid livery—out of his skin!

IT was DUSOVER'S last word: her name on his lips. His beautiful
brown skin was picked up, stuffed, and presented (with the livery,
which SIR GTTY sold at a lair price), to the Museum of the neighbour-

more than once during her stay at Focksday Hall BELLA would

"' I have lived and loved: and it is plain
That while I live I '11 lore again.'"
As she murmured this to herself, the sky-
light above was opened, and the Hox. PERCY
SHOBTWTND, who seemed to possess the peculi-
arity of never entering by a door, looked in.
"1 see you!" said the HON. PERCY SHORT-
WYND, laughing. He looked pleasant when he
laughed.
''And I you," replied BELLA, throwing up
her little, sparkling, provoking, petulant green
eves, which PERCY SHORTWYND catches, and
then throws back a tender regard.
BELLA sings out—
"The Captain with the whiskers
Takes a sly glance at me!"
Again the HON. PERCY laughs, and slides
down a rope which suspends a crocodile from
the ceiling. He is not a professional acrobat,
and the exertion tells upon his robust frame.
He is not handsome—not a fairy prince in pink
tights, and a blue feather in a muffin-cap,
certainly; neither is he a charity-boy of twelve
years of age, in a brown jacket, coarse corduroy
knee-breeches, and blue stockings; he is not
a lily-handed, curled, woman's darling, but he
has a beautifully rounded, shapely waist,
small, thick, eolumnar-like legs, dimpled, fat
hands, a great, broad chest, a complexion like
gingerbread, and dark, crisp hair, forming an
astrachan-like fringe to what might have been,
but for his perruquier, one of the clearest
heads in the world. He has kind, grey, eager
eyes, a rich, brown-gravy complexion, and a
eabn, dispassionate nose, standing up against
his hot, red cheeks like a mellon-green fig on
an old sun-dried, fruit wall.
As he reaches the floor, he looks confusedly
conscious of having been seen descending very
awkwardly.
The clear moonlight is streaming in, on
these two, through the skylight above; for,
the solitary custodian of the Museum has for-
gotten the xinwonted presence of a visitor—a
greater curiosity than the curiosities them-
selves—and, having locked up the building
for the night, has discharged himself of his
official duties, and has gone home to bed.
BELLA has stayed beyond the regular hour of
closing, and the HONOURABLE PERCY SHORT-
WYND has followed, and sought her out in this
strange fashion.
"If you do not wish me to stay here," says
PERCY, in a calm, respectful voice, "I will
go." And he lays one hand on the rope, as
if about to ascend by the same way as he had
mad(£his descent.
"No! no!" she cries, with all a woman's
mad unreason, "Don't go! You must not!
I won't let you! You "re too heavy !—I mean
the rope is too slight! You'll be killed!'1
And so, gasping, she stretches out her white
arms towards him. and, as a cloud passes over the moon—thus leav-
ing them in total darkness—she falls insensible into his embrace.

WHITETHORN WINTER.
CHRISTMAS comes but once a year;
Yet, as now, the first of May,
Coming, oft, with cold severe,
Seems another Christmas Day.
Stormy sleet, and rain, and hail,
Pelt the plains with frequent showers;
East and north-east winds prevail;
Sear the leaves, and bite the flowers.
Mid the crankled foliage green,
Bright still glows the scarlet berry.
Merry Christmas though we 've seen,
Can't we make Mpy likewise merry?
Whilst the sky is fufl of snow.
Deck the wall with sprigs of holly,
Hang on high the mistletoe,
And indulge in rampant folly.
Drink until you 've had enough,
And continue drinking after.
Hunt the slipper and blind-man's-buff
Play, with peals and roars of laughter
As at Yule, to keep your souls
In your bodies warm, poor fellows!
Pile the log on blazing coals;
Sing " Old Rose and bum the bellows.'"
Merry Christmas folk so name,
For 'tis made a festive season;
Merry May for but the same,
If for any kind of reason.
May, too, if but once a year,
It comes with Polar blasts and breezes,
Surely it should bring good cheer
As it blows and snows and freezes.

LADIES ON THEIR LEGS.
EAR MR. PUNCH,
FOREMOST among the many disa-
bilities of Women, which all lovers
of the sex must wish to see removed, I
place her inability to speak at public
dinners. It is a scandal and a shame
that men should quite monopolise the
right of public speaking, considering
what good use Ladies can make of their
tongues when they get the chance of
using them. Even when the toast of
"The Ladies" is proposed, a man
.jumps up, and claims the honour of
responding.which he docs with a vast
deal of stammering and
stuttering, and stupid com-
monplace remarks about
the charms of the fair sex.
Why should not Ladies
have the privilege of an-
swering for themselves, and
of proposing, if they please,
the health of "The Gentle-
men" P This would at least
form some variety from
the usual vapid course of
after-dinner oratory.
ME. DISRAELI says the
charm of English art is
its originality j and if La-
dies were invited to dine
at the Academy, and per-
mitted to make speeches,
I think the yearly banquet
woul d be vastly enlivened, and our It. A.'s might now and then have an
original idea to be proud of. I have waded through the flood of words
Soured forth the other day at this masculine assembly, and have won-
ered howmen could possibly talk such solemn, common-place, empty,
no-meanjng, and stale bunkum! Instead of this monotony conceive
what varied themes a clever Chairwoman might find for a post-prandial
discourse. The subject of the Army she might smilingly dismiss by
warbling a few words of " Ah, quej'aime le Militaire !" while that
of the Navy might evoke a sadly'humprous description of her suffering
when invited to a cruise with the First Lady of the Admiralty, to
inspect the Channel Fleet. The step from Iron-clads to crinoline
would be obviously short; and the 'topic of the fashions being thus
artfully led up to, what a flow of eloquence would be forthwith
let loose! From bonnets to baby-linen, and thence to ball-dresses,
bouquets^ and dinner decorations, would be the easiest transitions in
a feminine harangue; and so the way would be made clear to
remarks on parties generally, picnics, croquet, drums, and so forth,
with the latest rinking news, and the spiciest scraps of scandal
in high life.
Thus, if Ladies were allowed to speak at public dinners, a marked

change would be made in post-prandial discourses, which readers of
the newspapers now wade through with fatigue. Variety is
charming; and, as no Lady would content herself with sticking to
the subject on which she rose to speak, the audience would be
spared that tedious monotony which is acknowledged to bo the bane
of after-dinner utterances.

FOR once in a way, the papers contain a cheering "announcement
relative to the Budget.
"In the Customs and Inland Revenue Bill there is a clause as to the restric-
tion of male servants in the 19th section of 32 & 33 Viet. c. 14. It is not to
include a person who has been bona fde engaged to serve his employer for
a portion only of each day, and does not reside in his employer's house.'
Give the Government their due, and that will be thanks for the
relief of poor householders from a vexatious restriction by which
the revenue really gained nothing, whilst boys and old men were
kept out of employment. Mr. Punch is pleased to find that Minis-
ters mind what they have been told, and hopes that this good
intention may not be put down, as so many good intentions are, to
pave the way of the new Bill through Parliament.

The Lords (Monday,
May 8), hy a narrow
majority of 12, decided
against cumulative vo-
ting in elections for Irish
Representative Peers.
Evidently a largo pro-
portion even of their
Conservative Lordships
are fairly ashamed that
Liberals should be alto-
gether excluded from a
voice! in the' representation of the Irish
Peerage. The LORD CHANCELL9E was
even more than usually reckless in his
reasons against the concession.
(Commons.) — The Financial Secretary
of the Treasury explained a curious dis-
tinction between the expenses of hang-
itig in Scotland and England. In the former the Koyal ^Boroughs have to pay the cost of
their own gallows, halter, and hangman; in the latter, the Sheriff is allowed £10 per
hanging, because, if he can't find a hangman, ho is bound to do the hanging himself. "Was
it supposed, by those who made such a distinction, that there never would he a Scotchman
to be hung but you would be able to find a Scotchman to string him up " for a considera-
tion;" just as it has been said, "there never was an Irishman to be roasted, but you can
find another Irishman to turn the spit." "Divil a bit o' like in it," says an indignant
Milesian, "the Irishman turns the spit for love; the Scotchman would tie the noose for
money."
The Merchant Shipping Mull once more, happily for the last time of its appearance.
MB. PLIMSOLL made a gallant, though ineffectual, attempt to enforce an official survey of
disclassed ships.
Sill C. ADDERLEY contended that such a requirement would be to reverse the present
practice as to surveys, which, no doubt, is the reason why MR. PLIMSOLL wants it. MR.
GORST moving Amendments on the Disciplinary Clauses, SIR CHARLES' manner of resisting
provoked such a feeling in the House, that MR. CROSS had to promise a Bill dealing with the
subject next Session. A pleasant prospect, if it is to be entrusted to the present President
of the Board of Trade! The rest of the Amendments being got rid of, SIR CHARLES was
enabled to enjoy his little crow in proclaiming the Bill through Committee, amidst the cheers
of the much-relieved House. No wonder they cheered!
"YTenry twelve nights, close confined,
Have they lingered, yawned, and dined;
Though the Bill could not be lost,
Tet it could be PlimsoU-toised."
It has, indeed, been a perilous passage through a fnanraig pas. SIR CHARLES boasted
that he had really, after his twelve nights' gestation, produced a Virgin Bill— meaning one
untouched by the rude hands of its would-be un-doers( or rather over-doers. Punch is
reminded of MARTIAL (Epig. i., 67) :—
"Secreta qnrore carmiha, et rudes curas,
Quits novit nnus Virginia pater ehnrto."
Or, if we may English it for SIB CHARLES'S behoof, —
"tPhat connultatione with BENTIXCK and STANHOPE,
What carking cares, as high or low rah hope
Of pinning pestilent Plimspll amendments,
And making clear Adclerleian jntendments.
Are his who Board 'of Trade's Chair doth fill,
To shape into life a Virgin Bill!"
Sffi W. HABCOUHT irreverently observed that SIR CHARLES'S virgo intacta had at all events
been delivered of two bouncing twins—the
deck-load clause, and the clause bringing
foreign ships within the Act.
On going into Committee on Naval Esti-
mates, MR. BRASSEY moved for a Royal
Commission to review the "Ship-building
Policy " of the Government.
MR. GoscHEN begged MR. WARD HUNT
to produce such policy.
MR. WARD Hirpn defied any man to say
that any Government could have any such
policy—and then proceeded to describe
the policy of the present Government, and
then agreed to the appointment not of a
Commission but a Committee to consider
whether sueh policy could be improved.
At first Punch thought the only upshot
of the discussion would be to show that
the British Fleet of the future was to be
like the Spanish Fleet of the past—a thing
we—
"Cannot see, because
It is not yet in eight."
But MR. WARD HUNT carried us clear
of this fear by his bold reversal of his
engines.
Tuesday (Lords). — A cheerful night.
LORD GREY laid a Burials Bill on the
table, and the MARQCTS OF HUSTLY car-
ried Second Reading of a Bill to punish
farm-servants for administering arsenic to
animals to make their coats shine.
"Ilfaut souffrir pour etre beau," is an
old proverb. But these ill-informed, if
well-meaning rustics, ride the proverb
literally to " death."
(Commons.)—SIR CHARLES DILKE tried to
move the House to move the Royal Academy,
because it had not moved, of itself, in the
right direction. SIR CHARLES spoke a long
indictment against the Forty—charging
them, in effect, as a band of forty thieves
with having stolen privileges and prestige,
honour, house-room, and hard cash, in the
shape of the splendid shillings of the public,
on a condition they have not complied with,
of teaching, cultivating, and promoting the
arts of design in England. Or if not forty
thieves, contended SIR CHARLES, they are,
at best, forty shop-keepers; and their Ex-
hibition, which they at first apologised for
not opening free to all, has now become a
receipt of custom, and the be-all and end-
all of their existence, the source of their
shillings, the scene of their Annual Dinner,
by help of which they keep a firm anchorage
among the official and aristocratic classes,
the stage on which they parade their supe-
riority over wretched " outsiders," whether
when they sit upon their pictures, or cold-
shoulder them off " the Line."
Perhaps no count in Sra CHARLES'S long
and heavy indictment against the Academy
might not be supported by evidence that
would go far to win a verdict of guilty from
an unprejudiced jurv. But such a jury SIR
CHARLES did not address in the House of
Commons, least of all a House with a
crushing Conservative Majority. If the
hard-headed and hard-hitting Chelse
Baronet drew the indictment against the
Academy anything but mild, MR. CART-
WRIGHT," MR. BAILLTE COCHRANF,, and ME.
COWPEH-TEMPLE went quite as far in their
more agreeable and amiable task of white-
washing—if we should not rather say
"sweetening "—and inegilping, framing,
and glazing their portraits of the Forty,
and hanging them in the most favourable
and flattering of lights. Even MR. BERES-
FORD HOPE, though he had his grievance
as a student of architecture, contended,
like MR. COWPER - TEMPLE and other
speakers, including MR. GLADSTONE, that
the House had no jurisdiction, as the-

Academy had in effect carried out the recommendations of the
Committee of 1863. (Mr. Punch has been studying those recom-
mendations, and can't, for the life of him, make that out.)
ME. GLADSTONE stepped! in as deus ex machina, with grave and
weighty reasons for the withdrawal both of SIR CHARLES DILKE'S
Motion—which was one of censure, not corresponding to the notice
given of it—and of MR. CARTWRIGHT'S Amendment—which called
upon the House to acquit the Academy, while contending that the
House had no jurisdiction in the case. Now the House, urges ME.
GLADSTONE, very decidedly, has jurisdiction in the case. (That
admission, at least, is a substantial result of SIR CHARLES'S Motion.)
There is a good deal to be said, with reason, against the Academy;
a good deal to be said, also with reason, in its favour. But what-
ever remark, pro or con., the Academy might be fairly open to, it
had committed no sin—either of omission or commission—to warrant
the House in coming down upon it with the heavy hand of censure.
that case forth. Think how wondrously facts may be transfigured
after double-distillation through the wits of a roguish suitor and
a rascally lawyer. Are we to hold counsel bound by such a brief,
and to make him answerable in damages for understating his case
as it appears thereon? Besides, as things stand, it is the best
lawyer who comes to the front. If more clients seek his services
than he can serve, at all events the fees stop his mouth, and
neither party is the better, if neither is the worse for him—a result
well worth paying for. At the same time, we should say, the fee in
such a case ought to be a payment by both sides. There was a con-
sentaneous howl against the Bill from all the barristers in the
House. "When they do agree their unanimity is wonderful"
—and MR. NORWOOD was defeated by 237 to 130. It is written
that the shipowner should stick to his ship. Let MR. NORWOOD
go, in future, to sea in his own bottoms, and paddle his own canoe.
Thursday.—Now dawned the day "Bigwith the fate of Titles'
On the whole, LORD JOHN MANNERS thought the best course Bill and Ben! "—no, no, nobody felt that; but the day when SIR
would be to withdraw both the Motion and Amendment, and to i HENRY JAMES had been magnanimously defied to combat d outrance
grant the Motion for
papers "showing the
attitude of the State
towards the Fine
Arts in the different
countries of Europe."
(What a charming
subject, by the way,
for a set of allego-
rical designs, to be
contributed by the
most historically-
minded of the Acade-
micians :—
The STATE—ram-
pant, couchant, dor-
mant, defiant, aidant,
reveillant, burkant,
as the case may be,
according to its
relation to the Fine
Arts.
And the FLNE ARTS
—resistant, crouch-
ant, snorant, hittant,
deprecant, mendi-
cant, kickant, as the
case may be, accord-
ing to their relation
to the State.)
So, finally, DILKE,
in comipliancs with
the advice of MAN-
NEKS, muzzled and
drew off his Motion;
whereupon CART-
WRIGHT, also con-
senting, whipped off
his Amendment. The
Motion for papers
was granted—and the
Forty breathed
again.
"But till that night's debate •
There were Forty, funking like one.'
(Mr. Punch has his own views on the subject of this night's
discussion, but he cannot admit that even the Collective Wisdom is
wise enough to be his mouthpiece on the relations of the Koyal
Academy to the Fine Arts, and the Fine Artists—being outsiders.
Has he not his own trumpet to talk through P And will he not talk,
when he sees fit?
Wednesday.—MR. NORWOOD. Member for Hull, and shipowner,
moved Second Reading of a Bill to make fees to Barristers recov-
erable by Counsel, and damages against Barristers recoverable by
Clients. "Que diable allait-il faire dans cette galere t" As Dun-
dreary would say, "What have shipowners to do with barrister's
fees?" Or was it that no lawyer could be found to lead such an
attack—hawks loyally objecting to "pike out hawks' e'en." This
change, say the barristers, would infallibly destroy the indepen-
dencej and lower the character, of the Bar. The barristers won't
have it at any price, and the public don't want it at that price.
The barrister's calling is a trying and a'ticklish one. It needs
brains even more than brass, and presence of mind quite as much
as absence of scruples. Counsel must be allowed a latitude in deal-
ing with the case on his brief proportioned to the longitude to which
roguish clients and unscrupulous attorneys together will go in setting

by the Prime Minis-
ter, with his maj ority
of a hundred behind
him. A safe challenge
to try a foregone con-
clusion! Punch, as
he has said, sees no
use in crying over
spilt milk. He hates
the Proclamation,
and the Royal Titles
Bill, and the Title of
Empress, like all
sensible people of his
acquaintance. But
there they are. Que
voulez - vous f It is
our duty, to make
the best—that is, the
least, rather than the
most—ofthem. Feel-
ing this, Punch
almost regrets that
the Opposition should
have given a night
to putting over again
the case so over-
whelmingly put
against the Govern-
ment by LORD SEL-
BORNE, to prove that
the Proclamation
does not carry out
the Government
understanding, not
because the Govern-
ment meant not to
redeem their pledge,
but because their
pledge was irredeem-
able. Of SIB HENRY
JAMES, it may fairly
be said,—
"That twice he routed all his foes,
And twice he slew the (lain!"
His proof of the'contradiction between the Proclamation and the
Government undertaking to localise the title of "Empress," would
have been crushing, but that LORD SELBORNE had put the matter
through the crushing-machine already. That being so, why dwell
on a debate of which the most conspicuous incident was the honour
conferred upon the Government by the support of DR. KENKAI.V?
ME. DISRAELI wound up with a perjubilant Ptean, supported by a
majority that will warrant any amount of Peeans—of 108. Mean-
while, the B. P. of the Metropolis—Upper Ten and Lower Ten
hundreds of thousands alike—had been hurraing itself hoarse in
welcome of the PRINCE OF WALES, as if to show that whatever the
Royal Titles Bill may do to sap, or unsap, the roots of loyalty, it
still flourishes as durable and deep-rooted in the British heart as
our native oak in the British soil.

pulsion. Is it due to public conviction, or priestly influence, that
so good a case has been got up for contending that opinion in Ireland
is in favour of shutting up the whiskey-shops one day in seven? The
Major was absolutely pathetic on the unalienable right of every man
"to drink'as much as he can carry." That right, dear Major, im-
plies its correlative duty—"to carry as much as you can drink."
Tis few can drink or carry as much good liquor as the Major, or
what a prospect would the enforcement of this right open to the
Irish distillers!

WHILE over the Atlantic the young Giant of a hundred
Holds wide his arms in welcome to the nations old and grey,
Proclaiming fellowship in Arts of those by oceans sundered,
^.Crowning the Old-World-shows with this that greets his natal day.
While the eagles, clawed and beaked, round the Moslem sick-bed
gather,
And Europe watches, breathless, for their swoop through troubled
&ir,
Vot knowing but fierce rivalries may turn to rending rather
Those that struggle for the carrion than the carcase they should
share.
While France toils slowly to rebuild her greatness shrunk and
shattered,
Of King's friends and Republic's patching truce that time may
hide,
While Spam, as proud a pauper as e'er draped his mantle tattered
Like a robe royal, draws his rags the bleeding sores to hide.
Lo, happier England, busy in awaiting and adorning
The way for one she welcomes as mother welcomes son,
Whose coming - home from far-off lands her evening turns to
morning,
And age's load makes light to bear for love's work to be done.
Where athwart fields green with Spring-time the iron-ways run
grimly,
Holiday crowds are gathered, flags wave and flowers are fair;
Where through the smoke suburban the festal trim shows dimly,
Like sights and sounds of welcome glad the eye and fill the air.
'Tis the Prince, the King of England that is to he hereafter,
Comes back to his own England from his travel, bronzed and
brown,
To the wife of his and England's love, to their babes' happy
laughter.
To mother's love, that even wife's and children's love doth crown.
And as the heart of England was stirred with a great sorrow
When he lay sick, it seemed, to death, and love could naught but
Now from the wife's joy at his side all hearts a gladness gather,
That God hath brought him home again, who held him on his
way.
'Tis no mere flourish of 'paid pen, no phrase of courtier's tongue,
Proclaims us loyal to our line of law-abiding kings;
'Tis for a son in more than name that England's heart is strung
To this high note of welcome that through the welkin rings.
'Twas no base flunkey fellowship that followed, day by day,
His doings and his dangers, parades, and pomps and shows;
The wild work of the jungle, the spoiling of the prey,
The staunchness that no toil could tire, the strength with need
that rose.
More we loved'him, that in wild-wood as in durbar or divan,
He bore him manly, princely, as an English Prince should do;
That he took the rubs and roughings of travel like a man.
And, if he won new friends in crowds, to the old friends still was
true.
He is kindly, gay, and gracious—he is manly, bold, and brave:
'Tis grace and manhood that rule hearts since first the world
began.
And he that will wear England's Crown must no allowance crave—
Had need be every inch a Prinoe, and every inch a Man.
We hold our QUEEN so dear we would brook no change of name,
No addition to the style we have used and loved so long:
The music of " GOD save the QUEEN," to Empress 01 would frame,
And we stick to the old title as we stick to the old song.
But all our quarrel is for love and loyalty beside:
Let who doubts look how England takes her Prince back to her
breast,
With a benison on that sweet face she welcomed as a bride,
Welcomes still more as a mother with lusty children blest. "22IZ

SCENE—Village Inn, Hampshire.
Languid Swell. "'STHAWA WIFL'CAW HEAW?"
Barmaid. "'BEo PARD'N, SIR!"
Swell. "'STHAWA WIFL'CAW HEA\V!"
Barmaid. "DON'T UNDERSTAND FRENCH, SIR!"

(He is supposed to have meant, "Is THERE A RIFLE CORPS HEBE ?")
A MEDICAL PARTNER.
SPEAKING in the Theatre of the University of London
the other day, that of the presentation of diplomas and
medals to successful candidates, LORD GRANVILLE, the
Chancellor, took occasion to advocate the admission of
women to medical degrees. MR. LOWE followed on the
same side of a question on which it is disgraceful to the
members of a literal profession that there are two sides.
Not so much because this is owing to a mean Trades-
unionism, but rather in that, if, as the Unionists allege,
women are naturally unfitted for the practice of medi-
cine, the fear of competition with them is grossly stupid.
It was well remarked by MR. LOWE that "Woman was
never more in her place than by the sick bed." If slit-
were duly qualified to occupy that place, she would not
only be exempt from the necessity of marrying to sub-
sist, but would be in possession of knowledge which, in
the event of her marriage from choice, would especially
befit her for the part of a wife and a mother. It would
also materially help to render her an unmixed blessing,
by preventing her from being, in one particular, a heavy
burden to her husband. A woman who knows how to
take her place by the sick bed, knows how to keep her-
self out of it. Even if she have no patients, therefore,
a medical woman is in a condition to avoid becoming a
patient herself. She also knows better than to let her
daughters injure their health by tight lacing, late danc-
ing, and other unwholesome follies. If she herself fetch
her partner no fees, she at least saves him doctors' bills,
and undertakers' also, besides continual alarm and
anxiety. The girl who has well earned a doctor's de-
gree, is one whom a young man, even in these sumptuous
times, could almost venture to think of marrying on two
or three thousand a year.
Moral Freedom in Spain.
THE question of liberty of conscience has lately been a
good deal discussed in the Spanish Cortes. In Spain
there appears to be quite a national feeling in favour of
an unbounded liberty of conscience. This; however, is
something other than freedom of theological opinion.
The liberty of conscience prized by true Spaniards is
the exemption of the national conscience from all such
trammels as pecuniary obligations of the nature of
Bonds.
MORE HONOURS!
A WELL-KNOWN Tobacconist has decided upon calling
a very tine class of Tobacco he has in stock, "Prince's
Returns." How gratified His Royal Highness will be!
LAW UNDEE THE EEJECTED ACT.
"He could not avoid always seeing his children in his brief."—Speech of
tht ATTORNEY-GENERAL upon the Barristers and Advocates Fees £ul.
JONES versus SNOOKS.—June 18i/*, 187—?
THIS, the first case held under MR. NORWOOD'S recently-passed
Act. was chiefly remarkable for the conduct of the Counsel engaged
in the trial.
The Plaintiff was represented by MESSES. COKE, Q.C., and BLACK-
STONE. MR. SERJEANT DOE and MB. RICHARD ROE appeared for the
Defendant.
MR. COKE, Q.C. (who was evidently suffering from violent emotion)
said that this was a matter of the last importance. If possible, he
would give an account of the facts of the case. He really must
implore the indulgence of the Court.
His Lordship. Really, you seem to be very unwell.
Mr. Coke, Q.C. (bursting into tears). I am, my Lord—indeed I
am. I feel that should I make one false step, should I be guilty of
the least indiscretion, my Client may recover damages against me.
and then my dear children—my poor little ones—oh, it is too painful!
I must retire. I throw up my brief, and retire. (Sensation.)
ME. COKE, Q.C., then left the Court.
His Lordship. This is really excessively painful. MR. BLACK-
STONE, will you kindly continue vour leader's argument P
Mr. Slackstone. Oh, my Lord, would that I could! But no!
although I am but a Junior (I have been called a promising Junior)
of some three-and-fifty summers, I too have a heart. It has been
my boast for thirty years to support an aged grandmother. (Sensa-
tion.) This secret I have kept until now, and only now do I reveal
it to a heartless world. (Cries in Court of " No, no.'") I repeat a
heartless world, to account for conduct that otherwise might appear

Mr. Roe. My Lord, I wish to make a short statement. Since the
passing of the new Act my nerves have become terribly agitated.
In every brief I see the grim faces of my ancestors, telling me to

strongly inclined to plead "guilty" on bis behalf, and—

fresh Counsel.

MAY MEETINGS.
F course a number of the
May Meetings have been
very successful, but there
have been also som
failures. For instance :—
"When BROWN met ROBIN-
BON, and remarked that i
was a lovely day; ROBIXSOI
at the time being a sufferer
from bronchitis, and the
wind being N.N.E., ROBIN-
SON'S 'language was. noi
what it might have been
had the wind been S.W.
Again the meeting of MH,
DUNUP with his creditors
was scarcely satisfactory,
inasmuch as Ma. DUNUP
snapped his fingers at his
creditors, and they in return
threatened criminal pro-
ceedings. MB. D. is now
on the Continent.
It was not a successful
meeting between EDWIN
and ANGELINA in the lane,
when the clock struck nine,
and they quarrelled, and
both caught a dreadful cold which rendered them " perfect sights"
for at least a fortnight.
Success did not attend the meeting of two vehicles in Wych Street
when neither would give way, and both were summoned by the
Police, and duly fined for obstructing the traffic.
There was not much glory either about a rencontre between
DE TOMPKYNS and Miss GWENDOLINE DE COURCY, when the former,
who had been neglecting the latter, observed playfully, "And doth
not a meeting like this make amends ?" and when the Lady imme-
diately rejoined ' Not a bit of it; unless you give me the seal-skin
jacket and the diamond ring you promised me so often."
There was also another meeting which was not altogether of an
unchequered character. Two individuals " met, 'twas in a crowd."
One of the individuals missed a valuable gold repeater on setting
out of the crowd.
It is no use multiplying these cases. Life has many phases, and
the most pleasant meeting Mr. Punch has heard of is where two old
friends, having had a disagreement, met one another half way and
made it up.

GONE WRONG I
A NEW NOVEL. BY 1IISS KHODY DENDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh. Down like a Shower," "Red in the Nose is S/M"
"Qoodf Buy Sweet Tart I" "Not Slily, But don't Tell."
CHAPTER XIII.— What Somebody says.
"WHAT can PERCY SHOETWYND do in such a situation, with this
round, warm, firm, unconscious beauty in his arms?
She is, it is true, little more than an acquaintance. But then she
is an acquaintance. He cannot drop her suddenly on that account
But a few days ago, after he had first seen her, he felt that he
could not do without her: now he does not know what to do with
her.
Shall he break open one of the butterfly cases in the Museum and
leave her there for the night? Her warm soft hair caresses his
cheeks, and mingles, sympathetically, with his weeping whiskers;
and it is no wonder that, in this intoxicating moment, he loses his
own head, and imds hers on his shoulders. Two heads are better
than one; but where is Aw own? He looks down the passage!
-I he blackness is illumined from the Aquarium Department, where
a stream of light is always kept burning— a sort of floating beacon
in case any ot the fish should be taken Ul in the night.
Here he lays her down at full length, reclining in an arm-chair;
aeavily on the outline of her knees lie her blue-veined hands and
ivory-carved wrists. What can he do? He caresses her gently
with a small wire hand-broom, which he fortunately picks up close
at nand th
,
at nand; then he pulls a live, wriggling, twisting, agonising eel
lets it wind itself playfully about her f
out of its tank, and es i win se payuy aout her face,
until, with a deep-drawn sigh, the soul comes back to its own place
and, pale and clear, her eyes' dark glories shine forth once more
beneath the upturned, curling lashes. Then he withdrew the cold,
eshing nsh from her face, and restored it to its tank.
What was it tickling me ?" she asked, in a low, frightened voice.
'Only a fish," answers PERCY, with a reassuring smile. "You
looked ill. and I thought I could eel you. So I did." Then he
added, softly, very softly, " You 're in the Aquarium."
"You 're a Fellow," she replied.
"You 're not another."
Then she recalls their relative positions: she, a nameless depen-
dant, a lady-help in the house of a fine, old-established, English
gentleman, whose titled son now stands entranced by her side.
"Go awav!" she says, faintly.
"Never!' he replies, impulsively shaking his short brown locks,
more curly than a bull's forehead. The next moment he has strained
her to his heart.
"BELLA !" he cries, "I will marry you, even if my father cut
me off with a shilling."
"What could we do ?" she asks, feebly.
|| Do!" he cries. "We could keep a bun-Ion shop."
Yes," she answered, lifting up her great green eyes towards
him, and speaking with a mouth like a ripe cleft cherry, "we could
keep a bon-bon shop, and make money by letting out suH'fts—
"Sweets of apartments, and taking in a flat or two," he cries,
finishing her sentence for her. and then laying his lips upon the
blossom of her sweet red mouth, he thinks that no bon-bon in all
the imaginary mtigasiit will be equal to this.
Suddenly a pang of jealous suspicion shoots across him, and he
starts as if with pain.
"Tell me," he asks, "have you ever loved any one before this?"'
Now is her opportunity. Is she to speak truth, or to lie? What
matters it to him, as long as he is happy '(
"Never! " she replies, with unhesitating vehemence.
Has she forgotten that figure of DUSOVER in the glass case? No,
but she will not think of it; she rejects it as being no longer a case
in point.
Then she stoops down, bending herself to her square-set, broad-
shouldered, sturdy lover, and whispering in his ear, "I love you to
subtraction!" she places two burning lips on the back of his
head.*
Enraptured, overjoyed, amazed at his own ecstatic, blissful happi-
ness, PERCY catches her to his heart with both arms, and whistling
a popular melody, galop time, he flies round the Museum with her
in frenzied haste.
Then, panting and palpitating, they dance in the middle of the
room, silent, careering, inexpressibly happy.
The old clock in the town strikes two, as, to relieve their over-
jurdened feelings, they commence playing Dumb Crambo. PERCY
s to leave the room, and BELLA is to tell him what the word rhymes
i ,.^e.9Pen3 tne door to go out into the passage, when in walks,
pale, digmhed, statuesque, and classical, LADY VIRGINIA CREEPER.
So!' she says, in a hissing voice. "This is what you call
Jumb Crambo!
BELLA sinks on the ground trembling, with a world of horror and
surprise in her great, innocent eyes; while PERCY, who at the first
start had jumped backwards into the Octopus Tank, now rises from
;hence, calm, dignified, serene, and confronts his cousin, as she
stands, with her pink ears back, and that zebra-like look in her
countenance, the very picture of a resolute, and cruelly-chiselled
itatue, in the grey moonlight.
CHAPTER, XIV.— What the Author says.
"WELL!" says PERCY SHORTWYND, turning towards the LADY
TIBGINIA CREEPEB, his face growing white and fierce. "Do you
not believe me?"
The zebra-like look comes into her face, as she replies, with freez-
ng calm. "I do not believe you, my boy. I fina you and Miss
JELLA ST. JOHN VILLABS in the Aquarium Department of the
duseum at four o'clock in the morning, and I do not believe that
'our sole object in coming here was to play Dumb Crambo. I may
>e behind my age—and I wish I were more so by several years—but
. have yet to learn that Dumb Crambo, in an Aquarium, between
wo people, is not contrary to all preconceived notions of propriety
and deportment. Therefore you will allow me to deliver my mes-
age, and then to take you, MR. PERCY SHORTWYND, away with
ne.
These last words she says haughtilv, and with terrible effect.
Whut is her message? That, at least, slie can let BELLA know, and
at once.
"It is a telegram," replied LADY VIRGINIA, elevating her cold,
lassie head, and extending upward her Jong, white, Parian marble
neck.
"A telegram!" exclaims BELLA, stung into swift anger with this
• "On tht back of ku food." The italics are ours (the Editing Com-

frozen, Gunter-iced woman, and feeling her own face burning hot-
lier than a furnace. "Give it me!"
"I could give it you with pleasure," returned VIRGINIA, with a
curve of her suave lips, expressing the intense bitterness of a bland,
unforgetting, unforgiving nature; "but I prefer simply handing
you the telegram, which, as you may see, I have already opened
and read."
"And it says ?" the poor young girl asks nervously.
"It says," answers LADY VIRGINIA, glancing at PERCY, with a
cold, impassive smile—" ' From the REV. THOHAS HASSOCK to Miss
BELLA ST. JOHN VILLARS. Come. I am very ill. All U. P.
There is money in it.'"
"And who is THOMAS HASSOCK ?" asked PERCY, his face distorted
with passion, as he pulls at, and bites, his long whiskers.
LADT VIRGINIA unbuttons her great eyes, and hooks her nose
with even more frigid, aristocratical haughtiness than usual, as she
replies, "THOMAS HASSOCK is the lover of Miss BELLA ST. JOHN
VILLABS."
PERCY SHOBTWYND jumps up three times in a bitter, surging
wrath that for a few moments quite carries him away. But as they
waited there for him, expecting him back every moment, he returned
at last, and speaks with a quickening, deepening emotion in every
word.
"You have deceived me!" he says, turning a blank back upon her
sternly.
LADY VIRGINIA stands hard by—hard as the iron nails in the
planks of the floor,—fanning herself blandly, with the zebra expres-
sion so strong on her face now, that even the upturned, speaking eye
of the passionately admiring Octopus, as he gloats on her marble,
Clyte-like charms, from a recess of his deep, cold tank, is for a
moment dimned, and silenced, by a great, overpowering awe.
"I have deceived you," she answers, with whitened lips, whence
proceeds a grievous, touching: sound,—a something resembling the
recently cut grass in summer, inasmuch as it is a fresh moan; >rgood
bye!"
"Good bye!" he answers, shortly,—very shortly even for him,
who is scarcely five feet six in the longest day. "I shall never see
you again nor speak another word to you." *
She flings herself upon his breast, her arms cling around his
thick, brown throat, and her wealth of hair falls all over his broad,
strong back and shoulders, as he pants and gasps in her embrace,
heaving his short, heavy, columnar legs up in the air one after the
other, in vain attempts to free himself from this fair, full, soft,
tepid, light-headed, heavy-bodied, caressing burden. She clings
frantically, with ivy-growth tenacity, around nis broad, open throat.
VIRGINIA, classic though she be; must be colder than iced marble
if she can stand by and witness this calmly. Reddening for once in
her life, and witn some show of resentful animation, she stoops
majestically, and, with her white, long, harsh, handsome hands,
seizes PERCY firmly and determinedly by the ankles. He is between
the two. BELLA has him by the head-locks, VIRGINIA by the fet-
locks. The latter will not release him, holding him as by a strong
chain that cannot be broken.
To and fro they swing him, these two glorious, brave, loving
women—with the violent flooding of a long pent-up passion. Their
hearts and pulses begin to beat madly, frantically fast, as though
rivers of flame instead of blood were coursing through their veins.
Their heads swim round the Aquarium, and, such is the boiling,
burning heat, that, were the Thames there, it would be set on Are;
but, being as it is,'only the fish are fried to cinders in their trans-
parent, cool tanks, now turned into very hot-houses, rather for
orchids, than octopuses.
A man is not easily pulled into little bits, but at one or other
woman's feet he must fall, scarred by the fierce, unequal contest.

"An Extraordinary Sea Monster, resembling
the sea-serpent, was encountered by the P. and
0. steamer Hyda»pe» on her voyage from Bom-
bay to Aden. The creature was discovered early
one morning to be following the vessel, and was
seen, says a correspondent of the Bombay Ga-
zette, by every one on board except the captain.
It was composed of a dark mass looking like
tangled seaweed, 20 or 30 feet lone, and 10 feet
wide, crowned by a huge black head, with a flat
top, like a toad, a thick fringe of reddish hair
over the mouth, and bright copper-hued scintil-
lating eyes. The monster followed peaceably
enough till aroused by the cries of some children,
when it raised itself out of the water, gave a
hideous bellow, and aimed three blows at the
mainmast. The last touched the mast, making
the ship sway violently, and the monster imme-
diately disappeared, leaving not even a ripple on
the water. The correspondent declares the crea-
ture could not have been a serpent, and gives his
name as a warrant of good faith."—Netcs of the
Day.
SIB,—No doubt, owing to your having
taken a deep interest in the last sea-
serpent, you will be overwhelmed with
letters, speculating upon the nature of
the one alleged to have been seen by the
passengers of the P. and 0. steamship
Hydaspes in last March. I take leave to
anticipate futile conjecture, by pointing
out that the "thing so eloquently de-
scribed by the REV. MH. STRONO in his
letter to the Bombay Gazette, can be no
other than the Jabbericock, whose name
and habits are now so familiar to us all.
No doubt the unwillingness of the Cap-
tain of the ship to face the hideous monster,
mav be accounted for bv the fact that he
couldn't find a " vorpal blade " on the spur
of the moment.

happiness of hooking this considerable

following the hold of VIRGINIA, falls through the open door, while
BELLA lies helnless and gasping, with the brown, crisp, curly,
pomaded looks in her hand, which had but now glistened on the
head of her lover PEBCY SHOHTWYXD.
VIRGINIA lays her cold, white hand on his shining head, and
bending down her white neck in a despondent attitude, strokes it
with mournful reproaehfulness. She is sad. even in the moment of
her great victory, she is sad. Was it for this she had played, and
won?
"I can soon get a new one," he murmurs, biting his lips.
"Come," says VIRGINIA, drawing herself up to her stately height,
and taking PERCY SHORTWYND with her. BELLA followed him with
her large, mournful eyes, as he was thus taken up by his affianced
bride, until he disappeared.
"Oh my wig!" she heard him utter, faintly, as he was lost to
her view. Then, with a great cry, and with the very little wool
that had so lately come from the HONOURABLE PERCY'S head, she
threw herself despairingly into a tank; and the Fishkeeper, one
hour later, entering, found her wailing in the Aquarium.
"Promise me," she said, piteously, falling upon and kissing his
broad shoulder, "promise me that I shall not catch it, and I will
hook it."
The Fishkeeper had a light figure, and a small, questioning,
retrousse face.
"I 'm a married man, Miss," he said, drawing himself up to his
full height with an appearance of calmness, "with a family; but,"
he added, relenting a little, as her white, plump, blue-veined hand
unexpectedly strikes his first blue, then black eye, "I will see you
to the railway station?"
""Will you not see me further first?" she asked, imploringly.
"I will," he answered; and so they passed out into the quiet
street, and onward to the sleeping station, where, true to his pro-
mise, he not only took her ticket, but accompanied her up to the
house of the REV. THOMAS HASSOCK, where, lifting his hat stiffly
and politely, he bade her farewell, and returned by the next train.
Then she went up-stairs, to where poor THOMAS HASSOCK was
lying, and entered his room.
"You telegraphed for me ?" she said.
But poor, wan, wasted TOMMY did not hear her; he was lying in
bed and playing the concertina under the bedclothes.
As she approached the bedside, she heard his muffled voice from
under the blanket gently singing these words,—
"Here's another good man gone wrong."
"Perhaps," she said to herself, "he may have water on the
brain; and, if so, a tap on the head will relieve him."
So communing with herself, she seizes the boot-jack, and, as
TOMMY raises himself from his ambush, she lets it fall sharply on
his pretty, silk, light-brown hair, the one thing commendable about
his outward man.
"So." he exclaimed, with a golden smile on his calm, passionless
face, you have come at last." He felt that he loved her—as he
had always done, madly. So he lay back on his pillow, and, gazing
wistfully into her moist, full eyes, murmured, "BELLA."
She stooped over him, and listened greedily.

THE WIND AND THE WOOL.
'TIS an ill wind that blows
nobody (rood:
Such a wind in the East for
the last month has stood.
To no men, at least, can it
profit have blown,
Exoopt Undertakers and
Doctors alone.
Long faces are pulled by the
pastoral swains
Whose fleecy live stock crop
the verdurous plains,
And the dales, and the downs,
o'er the spacious extent
Of the counties of Sussex and
Surrey and Kent.
Those sherp - farmers, ever
before till to-day,
Began their sheep-shearing
the first week of May,
But are forced to postpone
it a fortnight this year,
Now the East wind has blown
them a May so severe.
To the shorn lamb 'tis said
Heaven tempers the wind,
When the hand of the sheater
has left it bare-skinned;
Hut what swain in his senses that saying would trust,
When East winds like these in his eyes blow the dust P
Behold for a month, too. the local wool sales
Put off by the blast of those ill-blowing gales!
What matter if they, whilst the sheep-farmers weep,
A respite from shearing meanwhile blow the sheep P
Not only have husbandmen cause to complain
Of the wind that blows ills to their herbage and grain,
To the sheep-farmer's farming it blows a dead stop;
For sheep-shearing deferred is a check to his crop.
March winds blew of old, and then came April showers,
And our sires used to say that they brought forth May flowers.
May it not be June blight that these May winds will bring,
Which have blown all this while in the teeth of the Spring?
0 Clerk of the Weather, how long will it last,
This villanous, ill-blowing, easterly blast?
Send a Xephyr to chase agriculturist's fears,
And let the wool-harvest be reaped with the shears?
AT THE DEA\?ING-ROOM.
What a Papa sayt. Really, my dears, if you don't come down at
once we shall be late. The carriage has been here for a couple of
hours. John tells me that when he passed through the Park there
was a double row in the Mall. Surely you have had enough time
for your finishing touches.
What a Mamma says. Mind, dears, I don't like this at all—as a
rule. But really one docs look so rery well in Court Dress, Only a
soupc.on of colour, you know. AMY, dear, some of it has got on to
your nose. Never mind, dear, I will wipe it off for you.
WImt an Eldest Son says. Dear me, how my Militia tunic has
shrunk since the last Training! The sword-belt, too, seems to be
smaller. Very strange—I can't make it out.
What an Eldest Daughter says. Yes, I like the contrast very
much indeed. So pretty—isn't it?—cream-colour and rose-pink.
Satin, too, is so much better than silk.
What an Admiring Friend says. My dears, I think your dresses
simply quite too lovely. I could not let you go without giving you
a look in. Charming—charming! Perfectly sweet!
What n Younger Daughter says. I knew there wouldn't be room
for all of us in the carnage. FEED, my dear, don't you think you
could take a Hansom, and meet us there? Papa, you really must
get up for a minute—your sword is tearing my train.
What a Rude Boy says. Oh! look 'ere. Bill. 'Ere 'a a carriage
full for yer! Ain't they a stunning lot! Call ANSA MARIA and
SAIREY JANE, and let's 'ave a good look at 'em! Now, then, for a
shove!
What a Policeman says. Come, now, yon must move on. I can't
have you blocking up the pavement looking into the carriages.
Come, now, I say—just move on!
What a Bridegroom says. My darling, as I knew we should have
to wait a couple of hours at the very least in the carriage, I told
MORTIMER to put up a pint of Champagne and some chicken sand-
wiches. Now do, darling—do let me tempt you. I am sure they
will do you good.
What a Bride says. Oh! but really" it is so very dreadful!
Champagne in the morning! Oh! I don't think I ought to—really
I don't. Well, if you insist, dearest, I suppose I must. Are you
not my husband? But you will be careful, dear, won't you, not to
spill any of the Champagne on my train? And don't you think you
had better pull down the blind, dearP The sun is shining so
brightly, and I think, dear, I can see the DE ROSHERVILLES in the
distance.
What the Father of a Family says. I tell you what it is, JAXE.
It is simply disgraceful. You forget everything. You know the
last time we came to this—this—well, whatever you like to call it—
we were half starved, and here we are again without a single biscuit.
I have half a mind to leave you, and go off to the Club.
What the. Mother of a Family says. You will do nothing of the
sort—you will stay here. You are always thinking of eating and
drinking. Surely, you could have ordered something yourself. But
no! I have to do everything—yes, absolutely everything. However,
it will be soon over. You may not have noticed it, but I am rapidly
sinking into my grave. Now that you have challenged me, you
shall hear what I think about you. You are heartless, unfeeling,
selfish. Nonsense! leave the door-handle alone. Do stay, dear! I
didn't mean what I said—I didn't, really. How am I to get the
carriage without you? You really must stay. There now, 1 won't
say another word.
What an Elderly Page says. One of the cards is left here,
Madam: the other you will give to the LORD CHAMBKBLAIN.
What a Lady of Quality says. I really must request you to be
more careful. Your arm is hurting my back.
What an Alderman stiys. I am very sorry, Ma'am, but it ain't
my fault. The pushing is something awful. Now, then, LADY G.,
keep 'old of me when they go into the next room.
What a Devoted Husband says. I am sure you will be tired to
death with this waiting. I do so wish I could find you a chair.
What a Grateful Wife says. Never mind, dear. We shan't have
to wait more than half-an-hour longer. It will soon be over.
What a Gentleman-at-Arms says. Yoii must get into single tile,
please.
What a Great Court Dignitary says. The DUCHESS OF DULBO-
Rorron, LADY SNOOKS, Presentation—Miss SNOOKS, Presentation—
Miss ANGELINA SNOOKS. Mus. BROWN, Mas. JONES, LADY
ROBINSON.
What a Kind-Hearted Personage (in point of fact, Sir. Punch)
says. There, my dears, after weeks of preparation and hours of
waiting it is all over, and I hope you are satisfied, and not tired.
What John the Footman says to his Mistress (respectfully touch-
ing hi* hat). Yes, my Lady. (To Coachman, as he strings up on the
bojr, anything but respectfully.) Shortest way 'ome—old 'ooman's
orders.
What the Coachman says. That's the best bit o' news I 'vc 'eard
to-day.
What Everybody says. So tired; but it is quite the proper thing
to do!
ELEVENTH COMMANDMENTS.
"Tnou shalt not be found out" has turned the Decalogne into an
LTndecalogue from time immemorial. Mr. Punch holds the opinion
that for each individual there is what may be called an Eleventh
Commandment, suited to his idiosyncrasy. Thus—
Thou shalt not reveal the secrets of the prison-house. (MR. COPE,
R.A.)
Thou shalt not spread scandal and retract it. (The Editor of the
World.)
Thou shalt not invite Publishers to meet Poets. (The LORD MAYOR
of London.)
Thou shalt not make Greek heroines of white porcelain. (MR.
POINTER.)
Thou shalt not smooth away sex, or turn womanhood to wax.
(MR. LEIMITON.)
Thou shalt not flirt with detrimentals. (The Belle of the Season.)
Thou shalt not speak evil of dignities. (MR. LOWE.)
Thou shalt not contrive more mysteries and surprises. (The
PREMIER.)
Thou shalt not condescend to be Imperial. (The PIUXCE OF
WALES.)
A HAD MONTH, MY MASTERS!
WHAT mean these East winds, that so chill and parch?
Merely that May has on us stolen a March.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
KANVILLE on Grave-yards (Monday, Hay 15). Scarcely the
preacher one would look to for the handling of such a teit.
But he handled it well, in support of his Resolution, that it
is desirable to give facilities for interment in parish church-
yards, without the Church Service,—friends and relatives
being allowed to conduct the funeral with such Christian and
orderly religious observances as they shall think fit. The
question at issue has been, indeed, so completely threshed
out, that it is needless to add any of Punch's chaff to the
grains of sound sense and Christian charity which may be
winnowed out of the Lords'ispeecnes. Most of these, indeed,
are contributed by LORDS GRANVILLE and SELBORNE, who
put MR. MORGAN'S strong case even more strongly. But
it is something to hear a brace of Archbishops aamitting
that Dissenters have a grievance, and that opening the
Church-yard does not mean shutting-up the Church. The
BISHOP OF EXETER, too, not only spoke, but voted for the
Resolution. Of course Archbishops could not be expected
to rush in where Bishops feared to tread, so
we must not be surprised if, on the division,
BISHOP TEMPLE was left in a minority of
one, by his chiefs and brethren of the
Episcopal Bench. Still the speeches of my
Lords of CANTERBURY and YORK told rather
for, than against, the Resolution.
The BISHOP or LINCOLN, that highest and
dryest of prelates, can almost boast that
he has found a higher and dryer than him-
self in LORD SALISBURY, who drenched
Dissent with a douche of mingled wrath
and contempt that must have been as a
holy oil to BISHOP WORDSWORTH. On the
whole, however, both the weight of argu-
ment and the feeling of the House went with
the Resolution.
It is plain enough noWj if it was doubtful
before Monday's discussion, that the open-
ing of Parish Church-yards to all decent and
orderly religious services is one of those
foregone conclusions for which we may wait
with
"Faith in time.
And that which shapes it to a rational end."
LORD GRANVILLE'S Resolution only awaits a
leetle more spiritual and temporal resolution
in the Lords. Till then, let all who fail to see
that the burial of Dissenters in the Church-yard with their own services is the death-blow of the Church possess their souls in peace.
LORD CARNARVON brought in a sensible Bill, putting such checks on Vivisection as reason and science may join in approving.
(Commons.)—-RYLANDS up on his hobby, "Economy," got by ME. HUME'S Example out of Self-Conceit. If Rylands-Resolutions could
reduce Estimates, how cheaply we should be governed! But there is a kind of cheap Government not to be described except by the
addition of a dissyllabic epithet meaning the reverse of nice; and some may think this is the kind of Government Statesmen of the
Rylands order would be most likely to land us in. Flying CHILDERS made the running for MR. RYLANDS' Hobby, and galloped through
the financial history of the last few years, having everything his own way, and showing to his own satisfaction that we were spending
five and a half millions more than when last blessed by a Liberal cheese-panng Administration.
MR. WARD HUNT defended the Admiralty administration from the charge of waste. This, says MR. HUNT, is the way of it. The
Liberals come in, pledged to save; so, to show a reduction in totals, they sell stores, starve establishments, let down stocks, and
postpone orders tall, when the Conservatives climb into office over their ruins, they have to spend heavily the first few years to repair
the waste of Liberal savings. In short, your " Economist," says MR. HUNT, pares the cheese till the rind isn't thick enough to keep out
the rats and the blue-mould; and so Penny-wisdom brings in his yoke-fellow, Pound-foolishness, and both together work their will on
JOHN BULL'S establishments—Civil, Naval, and Military.
Suppose Punch puts into nursery-rhymes an unpractical night's playing at figures, fitter for children than grown men ?—

BBILLY and BICHARD were long-winded men,

MISTER HARDY played the card he

That cost on War-Office throw.
And FAWCETT whacks into Income-tax,
That to catch big tish spares little;
To which NoitTiiroTE tacks calculations lax,
That prove his own case to a tittle!
Tuesday (Lords).—In answer to LORD COTTESLOE, LORD CARNARVON told the tale of the KINO OP DAHOMEY'S insolence to COMMODORE
HEWITT; how that King had struck a British merchant, Ma. TURNBULL; and how the Commodore, in retaliation, had struck—oil—five
hundred puncheons, in the shape of a fine—which the King refused to pay, offering powder and bullets instead; and how it might
become really; necessary, if the Blockade of Whydah did not bring his sable Majesty to reason, to march on Abomey. his capital, the scene
of the most hideous abominations of the Abomey-nation, in the shape of bloody fetish rites, torture of slaves, and human sacrifices, put
them down, and rase it to the ground. The sooner the better.. Or, suppose COMMODORE HEWETT were to take Whydah instead of blockading

it, and if the King should ask, "Why da'?" answer him in the
dialect o f the Christy minstrel, "Cause dat Jons BULL'S plan of
bringin' naughty nigger to him senses."
(Common*.)—By a natural law of association, LORD ROBERT
dear simple soul, he is so innocent—may be prevented by putting all
sorts of checks and stoppers on bank deposits!
'Che CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER declined to interpose between
fools and their money. The parting of the two might be painful,
but Parliament could not prevent it.
MR. BRASSEY, the Cassandra of the Merchant Service, spoke a
weighty word of warning on the lack of sufficient training among
Second-class Merchant Captains. He would like to see voluntary
examinations in Modern Languages and Commercial Law (suppose
we add Rudimental Surgery and Medicine, while we are about
it ?) with inducements to Merchant Officers to study at the Naval
College (suppose we insisted on a University Degree at once ?)
The much badgered President of the Board of Trade said he found
it quite difficult enough to get Merchant Captains through the Board
of Trade examinations as they are, and altogether declined to
aggravate the difficulties of the passage.
MR. Burr moved to empty benches i'or leave to bring in a Bill for
coupling the lean, young Catholic University, and fat old Trinity
College into an Irish National University, Religion and Morality to
be under a Board of Roman Catholic Bishops, and any extra Endow-
ment that might be wanted to be drawn from the Irish Church
Surplus! The proposition suits'the weather, being more cool than
seasonable.
Not a Liberal was visible above the gangway to hear MR. Burr.
The Irish Tub was left, this time, to stand on its own bottom.
MR. WAI.POLE brought in the Cambridge Reform Bill. It is built
on the same lines as the Oxford Bill of the Government, and is as
good as a Government Measure. This Bill, too, contemplates a
process of transfusion—to bleed fat Colleges for the benefit of a lean
University. The scheme is to be worked by a Commission manned
by four Senior Wranglers, a Bishop, a Lord Chief Justice, and a
Professor of Divinity, with the mild wisdom of MR. BOUVFJUE as
Coxwain. Something like a University Crew!
Wednesday.—MR. COWEN wants the Licensing business turned
over from the Magistrates to a Representative Board, elected hy
the rate-payers. SIR W. LAWHON supports him. He sees in MR.
COWEN'S Bill a step to his own Permissive Bill for shutting up
Publics by plebiscite. Perhaps he thinks such Licensing Boards
will make public-houses so intolerable a nuisance that people will
sacrifice even their free agency to get rid of them, rather than
maintain them at the cost of a corruption to which Municipal and
Parliamentary corruption will be as snow to soot.
So argue SIR W. HARCOUHT, SIR W. BAHTTELOT, and MR. HENLEY.
The change is asked in the name of the Representative principle.
Better the J. P.'s than the L. V.'s with their hands on the tap; and
that is what, in too many cases, it would come to, in all probability,
with a popularly-elected Board to decide the question, Licence or
no Licence?" A great deal too much licence, we should fear, would
follow the adoption of the change advocated by MR. COWEN, but
rejected by the sound sense of the House, in a non-party division
of 274 to 109.
Thursday (Lords).—LORD DERBY told the House about as much as
the telegrams have told us already on the murder of the Consuls
at Salonica, ;md the panic of the Christians at Constantinople. The
agitation is allayed, and LORD DERBY hopes there is no danger. As
to that, Punch can only say that LORD DERBY is constitutionally
cool, and that London is a long way off Constantinople.
LORD POWEKSCOURT asked a question about Knightsbridge
Barracks.
EARL CADORAN said they would be built according to the plans in the
Tea-room of the House of Commons. Government had not yet taken
tenders, but they meant to be tough in resisting the remonstrances
of objectors, or suggestions of alteration.
(Commons.)—LORD H. LENNOX means to keep the Clock Tower-
dial illuminated all night, whether the House is sitting or no, that
early birds of artisans may know what o'clock it is, on turning out
to their work. This is a very wise little bid for popularity of LORD
HENRY. Considering how the face of Parliament itself beams upon
"the working-man" (especially about election time), the face of the
Parliamentary Time-keeper, outside the House, should look bright
for him through the dark. "£x luce lucellum" might be the
motto under the clock.
England will be glad to know that MR. CROSS does not mean to
allow the startling misfeasance, or mistake, of the Coroner at a late
inquest into a mysterious death at Balham, to pass without remedy.
LORD SANDON laid the Government Elementary Education Bill on
the .table. Enough for the night is the Bill thereof. Punch reserves
his opinion of the "blessed babby " till he and the Lower House
have had time to sit upon it. Meantime, he fears the babe looks
raifther rickety.
It used to be a question among the Schoolmen, how many angels
could dance on the point of a needle? The House amused itself
to-night with trying now many Economists could argue on the point
of an Income-tax exemption—whether its limit should be £80 or
£100—or whether the deduction should be £80 or £130 from incomes
up to £300 or £400.
It is hard to see how, if the one of these alternatives be statesman-
ship, the other can be Socialism, Communism, or any other awful
form of "ism." The CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER has been
ingenious enough to ease the screw on four out of five thousand
contributors, while tightening it on the upper one-thousand, who
have less weight in elections and make less noise about paying taxes.
Friday.—No House, nowhere—except at the Guildhall, and there
a great house, with a greater crowd of guests, however, than it
could well hold—old Guildhall and appurtenances, and new ex-
temporary ball-room together—for the City's welcome home of the
PRINCE OF WALKS.
TEMPERANCE IRISH MELODY.

No! Let's spurn the base bonds, with indignant aversion,
For the specious compulsion to do as we plase.

And resolved to control one another alone,
By the holy decrees of our Priests and our Pastors,
For our neighbours' correction as well as our own.
Ah, mano is the slave that from Whiskey on Sunday
Is content with the lave for himself to abstain!
To shut all Shebeens in all faces that one day
From our tyrants to wrest the proud freedom we mane.

To quench wid could water the thirst of the free:
If it was, by the Piper that played before Moses,
What a hullaballoo the oppressor would see!

Our demand to be ruled like gossoons at a school.
We '11 denounce the black villains like bondsmen that use us;
The thieves of the world that deny us Home-Rule!

IT having become known that the Office of President of the Supreme Council
to His Highness the KHEDIVE may be filled by a foreigner, the following
Letters have recently been received in Egypt:—
(LETTER No. I. Marked " Important")
Seven Dials (near lie/gravia, South Kensington, and
YOUR HIGHNESS, Eaton Square). London.
PERMIT me very respectfully to offer myself as a Candidate for the post
of President to your Council. For the last forty years I have had the greatest
possible experience in borrowing, in all its branches—from a shilling up to
£500.000. The latter sum was to have been paid to me in fully paid-up Shares;
but (from circumstances beyond my control), us a matter of fact, neither money
nor shares reached my hands.
Should you think well of my application, be kind enough to forward me
£1,000 by return of post, to defray preliminary expenses. Failing this, I shall
be happy to receive the sum of at least live shillings in postage-stamps.
I have the honour to remain,
Your llighncss's most obedient, humble Servant,

P.S.—Pardon me for leaving the postage of this letter unpaid. The paper
and envelope, too, might have been better had I not been forced to borrow them
(with the pen and ink) from a waiter to whom I happen to be under obligations
of a pecuniary character.

Lower Tooting.
Miss ROBERTHA HENRIETTA MANTRAP presents her compliments to the KHE-
DIVE ov EGYPT, and begs to say that she will be glad to accept the post of
President to His Highnesw's Supreme Council. As the KHEDIVE says nothing
about the sex of the holder of the office, Miss MANTRAP imagines that the fact
that she has the honour to be a woman will not prevent her from holding the
position she covets.
Miss MANTRAP considers herself well suited for the office in question, as she
has a ready flow of language—a most important qualification, she believes, in
dealing with Egyptian accounts. She points with pride (in support of ner
assertion) to a meeting held recently at St. George's
Hall, where Ladies proved, to the satisfaction of all pre-
sent, that the art of talking is by no means confined to
the soft sex.
Miss MANTRAP also believes that she will give satis-
faction to the KHEDIVE, as she shares with His Highness
a strong taste for what some people .are pleased to term
- useless finery. Under these circumstances she asks for
the post she solicits with confidence, urgency, and deter-
mination.
(LETTER No. III. Marked " Confidential."')
Houndsditch, E., and St. James's Street, S. W., London.
YOUR HroHNiss,
WE shall be happy to accommodate you with
;iny amount up to £500 (at onr usual rate of interest—
from five to 1500 per cent, according to circumstances) on

Some night, when no watch I keep.
For they all of 'em wear long knives,
And some have got pistols too.
And mine and my mates' dear lives
Aren't worth a tobaccy-screw!
They will take us unawares.
Like stuck pigs we shall die,
With no time to say our prayers,
And no ohance to exchange " Good-bye."
For a death on the Ocean Wave,
And a grave in the rolling deep,

On a foreign crew, dirt-cheap!

THE EEVERKND THOMAS HASSOCK was, apparently, as far that is
as human sight could pierce, at well-nigh his last gasD.
"Oh, TOMMY!" BELLA wailed, "you're not going, are you?
Oh! what shall I do here all alone by myself? Who will play the
concertina to me when you are gone? And when nobody else will
have me, there will be a strong likelihood of my remaining an old
maid, if you are not at hand to marry me. Do not go; TOMMY, do
not go! or at least stay here until it is perfectly certain you won't
be wanted any more, when, as you might be rather in the way than
otherwise, you can go to—wherever you like, and no one will care
leas than I! But at present, TOMMY, as there is no necessity for
you to withdraw in order to make room for your Uncle,* I ask you,
I implore you, I conjure you, to stay where you are!"
* "To makt room for yam Uncle." What the Editor >aid in a Letter to
the Authortn.—" ~.l propoi of this' Uncle,' so suddenly brought in; we have
never before heard of him in the story, and being afraid that it might either
be a mere slip of the oen, or, which would be more grave, the sudden intro-
duction of a fresh series of characters that might prolong the romance ait
infinitum, we have written to ask you for information. Who is the Uncle?
It necessary to the plot, why has he not been mentioned before? If unneces-
sary, why complicate matters now by bringing him in at, what we really
thought was, the lost moment?"
What the Authoress tay» to the Eli/or.—"Is it not permissible to intro-
duce an allusion to a popular modem lyric, and so crystallise what would
otherwise be evanescent, and give immortality to what of itself is perishable,
Her excessive grief seemed slightly to annoy him—him who was
already so far beyond all annoyance—for he raised himself with
difficulty on the bed, and, with hands growing disobedient, grasped
about darkly for his bolster: when he found what he sought, he
lifted it as it were a great weight to him, and let it fall three times
heavily on her bended, chestnut head. Then, as he sank back on
his pillow, a smile of happy memories passed across his countenance
—the recollection of the days when as a schoolboy he had excelled
in bolstering matches in the dormitory.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BELLA fell prone on the floor, her small, plump hands raised implor-
ingly above her head, and moaned painfully.
His eyes wandered from her face to where in a corner the sun was
going down, golden red as a glorious carrot.
I'm like him," said TOMMY, with a gleam of the happiness oi
former days when conundrums wore his greatest joy, " because I 'm
going down."
"Ob. no!" exclaimed BELLA, blushing, "you must mean'up
not ' down.'"
He aeemed a little worried by her not at once comprehending his
meaning, and mildly corrected her.
"The sun is sinking—so am I. That is why I am like the sun.
Doyou see?"
Yes, she did see; and, stooping, she covered his hand with warm,
passionate kisses, while, unseen by her, a smile stole over his placid
face, and his right eye slowly closed and opened, re-closed and re-
opened twice with an intense profundity of meaning.
"TOMMY," she sighed, "tell me you are happy!'
Then the oalm, gentle voice, interrupted by slight pantings, canie
to her ear again,
"I am: very happy, very, very happy," and once more he closed
and opened his eye with slight exertion, and, as she bent over him,
she caught these words, murmured indistinctly,
"I 've—gone—wrong—
For—the—sake—of—SARAH "—
the words of the tune he had last learnt on his concertina. Then he
gave her a sweet smile—so sweet, it might have been lollipops for
unorganised cherubs. She did not want that smile, and so she
returned it. Like a Frenehwqman she had been "coquette," then
"prude," now she was to show herself " derutee."*
Good bye, TOMMY. !" she cried. "Dear old boy, good bye. You
are going to Heaven, of course?"
"Of course, naturally," was the humble reply of this meek, dying
saint. ' I 'm a very good person. There never was a better person:
in fact, I am quite one of the best persons of my acquaintance.
But," he added, always unselfish, "I shan't really enjoy myself
anywhere till you are there. Of course out of politeness I shan't
say so, but I shall scarcely know a soul in the place till you come,
so don't disappoint me, will you? In fact, I don't think I shall go
to regions of Fairy Bliss, unless you come too." Then he put his
arms about her neck, and whispered, "I leave you"
She listened eagerly. She knew he possessed a little property in
the Venetian Asphalte Paving Company.
I leave you "he said, slowly, and with difficulty.
"What? she asked, in a soft, anxious whisper.
The reply came in the same gentle tone.
"Alone. As I have always left you. As you have always asked
me to leave you."
"But not now," she murmured.
"Not now?"
"No, dearest, truest ^Tomtr, my first, my best, my onliest,
lovingest, and most lovedest love, I have been young and wayward,
but I am so no longer. DFSOVER deceived me; OKLJSS is gone;
PEECY SHORTWYND has married VIRGINIA CUEEPEB. I would not
have had either of them at the best of my time—for my heart was
always true to you." Again his right eve closed, and opened, like a
wild rose, with tender significance, as ne pressed her closer to his
bosom, and stroked the soft, luxuriant mass of warm, sweet-scented
hair. "And I do not ask you any longer to leave me alone. Take
me, oh take me, TOMMY, I am yours!"
A convulsive tremor passed through his slight, patient body, as
he took her to his heart.
"Kiss me, BELLA, kiss me!" murmured this poor, fast-sinking,
saint-like creature.
Without a word he gathers her up in handfuls, as it were, and
for one heavenly moment they are bathed in the wild, tumultuous,
throbbing, fierce, religious silence of an everlasting farewell.
Her sister JENNY enters the room, suddenly.
(Te lie concluded in our next.)
• "Like a Frenchwoman 'Coquette, prude, devotee." What the Editor
soys.—" Excuse: encore. A Frenchwoman might be coquette, also prude, but
she never could be ' devotee'—for the plain reason that there is no such word
in the French language. She can be ' devote,' as a gentleman can be 'dfvot,'
and *devouve' she can be, but' devotee' never. Wo think it just as well to
mention this, there being BO much French scattered loosely about in your
charming works, and as you yourself would of course be the nrst to wish us to
correct, or expose, what you might possibly sot down to an error on the part
of the printer."

ALL AFLOAT!
AT the second of the late Scientific Con-
ferences at South Kensington the President,
DR. C. WILLIAM SIEMENS, announced an
istounding exploit performed by M. TRESCA,
Sous-Directeur of the Paris Conservatoire
des Arts et Metiers, who had read the
meeting an account of his researches into
"the now of solids." In proposing a vote
of thanks'to M. TRESCA, DR. SIEMENS said
that " by his investigations he had thrown
down the barrier between solids and
liquids." A scientific achievement of over-
whelming immensity; but what a confusion
it must create in the nature of things!
ENGLAND VERSUS GEEECE.
Jrsi now the Painter and the Bard
Are caught with this caprice—
That England's prosv, dreary, hard,
While beauty dwells in Gre«ce.
Hence six-foot Atalanta's Eace
'Gainst odds, and apples, heavy:
Hence laurelled Theban maidens pace,
And sing, a wax-doll bevy.
While Art seeks Greek ideals cold,
Mock-antique Bards indite,
And tales in LEMTRiiHE's prose o'er-told,
In puling verse recite.
At nobler fruits high souls might seize,
Than those we 're like to swallow
From BBOWNTSG-ARISTOPHAlTEg,
Or SwnruuaNE-sham-AroLLO.
Far fairer were more native growth,
And pleasanter 'twould be
If Poetrv and Painting both
Would work on what they see.
High in a place of power we stand
In an heroic time,
When there are doings in our land
For picture meet, or rhyme.
Greece painted Greece, and sang of Greece,
And cut Greek youth in marble,
And so won fame that shall not cease,
And glory none can garble.
England has snng of England too:
There's SHAKSPEARE, rivals scorning,
And glorious CHAUCER, tender, trne,
Minstrel of England's morning.
REYNOLDS and GAINSBOROUGH keep in lifo
The Great Men and tho, Graces,
That guided England's public strife,
And wore sweet English faces.
HOOARTH on England's social sores
Used pencil scalpel-keen,
Whose vivisection to the cores
Of vice cut clear and clean.
Poet and Bard, use eye and brain
Like them on life around;
If true the picture, strong the strain,
You, like them, will be crowned.
If statelier theme be not at hand,
With humbler themes begin:
Trv lyric of the Four-in-Hand,
Or idyl of an Irtn.
Trv English landscapes, women, men,
Till Punch shall thunder, " Cease !—
Too poor for England, Brush and Pen,
Your weakness waste on Greece!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
HINTS TO IMBECILES.
(CUit, Dinnert, and Donees.')
If you have got cheek
SAT that you are glad the Prince is hack,
enough, say that he
asked you to accom-
pany him. Say that
you think he is look-
ing better for his
trip. Be very par-
ticular about his
personal appearance,
as it will induce
people, who don't
know you, to ima-
gine that you know
him. Say how glad
the Princess is, as
nobody will be rude
enough to ask who
told you; if anybody
does, by the bye, say
it is only to be ex-
pected that she
would be delighted
at the return of her
husband.
Leave this subject
at once, and, before
any one else has an
opening, say, with
the air of aRtrsxnf
or a Revelation,
that you have been
to the Academy.
Every one will
brighten up at this,
and want to discuss
the pictures. Don't
let them. You can
keep the game in
your hands now, and
fain fame as a
older of original
views. Your friends
will want to distil
the criticism which
they have obtained
from the papers.
They will rave over
the "The Daphne-
phoria," and go mad
over "Atalanta's
Race;" they will
extol " The Widow-
er" andadore " Over
the Hills and Far
Away." Well, so can
anybody. But you
will abuse these
works; you will call
their painters names,
and say they ought
to be hung with their
pictures. Previous-
ly, however, learn
the names of two or
three very small
"skied" pictures,
by obscure artists,
and say loudly and
dogmatically that
those are the gems
of the Exhibition.
If any one says they
are not, shrug your
shoulders. If any
critic present dis-
agrees with you, call him a hireling;.
During the excitement caused by these latter remarks, you will
have time to explain the plot of Tannhaiiser. Say you heard it in
Germany, and it was far finer than in England. If any one asks
you in what town you heard it, call it quickly Cryptichonchoidsy-
phonostomata. Say Rossi is Hamlet from the Hanwell-padded-ward
point of view. He is not, but people don't know. Give the pronun-
ciation of JANATTSCHKS—your own, nobody will know better. Say
that " dear SALVDJI " is back, an d if your friends will stand it, give
imitations of him.
Say that you have got to go. You may be sure that yon won't be
asked to stay. Having departed, you can repeat your entertain-
ment at another
house,^ with the
assurance that you
will be looked upon
in the light of an
agreeable rattle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S: ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

USSIA, Prussia, Austria,
i'. England, in re
Turkey.
Since the Lords
had Vivisection in
hand (Monday, May
1'lnd), it was not from
the question in LORD
GRANVTLLE to oak
LORD DERBY as to
the interesting, if
painful, experiments
in the Vivisection of
Turkey now in progress, at the hands of the Northern Doctors. LORD DERBY
was ab'le to sav that England had declined to join in them. (Everybody sees
that the Sick Man can't get better; but we.don't like to take part in killing
him under pretence of curing. One thing seems clear. What between his
diseases and his doctors, he can't recover where he is. The climate of Europe
doesn't agree with him. Why not try change of air? Get him over to Asia,
and come to a fair and open understanding between England, France, Russia,
Germany, Austria, and Italv, how the estate is to be managed for the good
of the tenants, and not of the executors. That was what NICHOLAS proposed
to SIR HAMILTON SEYMOUR, before the Crimean War, and we fought rather
than entertain the proposal. And, after all, is not this about the best that it
is coming to ?)
Then came the smaller Vivisection question-^on Second Reading of LORD
CARNARVON'S Bill, putting scientific curiosity into humanitarian handcuffs.
Tuny, on behalf of the canine creation—and the feline race in whom he is not
above recognising a domestic poor-relationship—begs to thank the Government
for exempting dogs and cats from the knife. Anaesthetics arc all very well, but
doctors differ in the importance they attach to them; and your Kleins and Schiffs
evidently hold suffering dog-and-cat-cheap, in comparison with discovery. (By
the bye, what do the frogs, rabbits, guinea-pigs, and monkeys, on whom the
burden of Vivisection now falls heaviest, say on the chapter of Exemptions F)
LORD SHAFTESBITRY spoke warmly for the Bill, like a kind s«ul as he is. and
the Costermongcr's Donkey at St. Giles's would have brayed approval could he
have heard him. The DUKE OF SOMERSET tried a little chaff, in his own
style of cold-blooded common sense, but it did not take. Their Lordships
are sportsmen; they are not physicians or physiologists, and though they don't
mind sending away a bird with an ounce of lead in it to a lingering death, they
hate cutting up anything alive. Vermin is one thing, and Game is another.
Gentlemen must have their hunting and shooting: so field-sports must be
respected, though, as savage amusements, they are beyond regulation. The
laboratory is within the pale of Civilisation.
(Punch rejoices to know that henceforth the ardour of Science is to move in the
leading-strings of common humanity, and that the knife is not to be put into
the hand of every learner, to slash his way to knowledge through the nerves
of the lower animals. If beneficial discoveries can only be made by sounding
the well of life, let wise and reverent hands have the handling of the plummet.
But Punch had always understood that England, even without law, had set an
example of humanity to France and Germany in the conduct of physiological
and pathological experiments on living things. How if the chief effect of this
new law should be to drive our students to the French and German schools,
where, with their physiology, they may learn other things not quite so desir-
able?)
(Commons).—MB. DISRAELI gave a full and considered answer to MR. M.
BROOKS, stating seriatim the cases of the Fenian prisoners still in confinement, and
the reasons wh y it would be a lie in the teeth of justice and policy, as well as reason,
to remit their punishments. This raised a storm of
scurrilitv from MR. BIGGAR, whose offensive personalities
provoked MR. BROOKS, for himself and the other Irish
Members, to repudiate MR. BIC.GAR! Altogether, if
anything could open MR. BIGGAR'S eyes to his own
enormities, one would fancy this might. But no —he
will.be BIGGAH—the biggest of big , something, to
the last.
MR. O'CONNOR POWER insisted on the petition for
release of the Fenian prisoners, signed by 138 Members
of Parliament. But MR. ANDERSON said it would not
have been so numerously signed, at least among English
Members, but for the understanding that no murderers
were to be included in its prayer.
.MR. PAHNELL and MR. CALLAN denied the'alleged mis-
understanding, and MR. BUTT tried by special pleading
to prove that murderers in law might not be murderers
in fact, till the matter dropped in rather a confused
hubbub of antagonistic Irish and English protest.
On report of Merchant Shipping Bill Amendments,
several of the old battles were fought over again; and
MR. PLIMSOLL scored one important win, carrying the
absolute prohibition of winter timber deck-loading,
against Government, by 162 to 143! Whereon Punch
shakes hands with PLIMSOLL—SIB CHARLES a good deal
"bustled" as usual.
One is glad to think that he sees the end of his Plimsoll
purgatory at last. The Bill is to be read a Third Time
on Thursday.
Tuesday (Lords).—LORD GREY moved Second Read-
ing of his Burials Bill, for easing existing difficulties
by making new ones. LORD GREY proposes not to re-
lease the Clergyman from the obligation to perform the
service when he feels a conscientious objection, but, on
the other hand, he would not allow him to prevent some-
body else from performing service. Just one of those
sage compromises which please nobody. So it seemed,
for nobody, not even its parent, objected to its being
shouldered out, without a word or a division.
Several of their Lordships asked questions about the
Continuous Brake experiments on the Railways.
LORD ABERDEEN said the Report wasn't ready yet.
How should it be, with the break _ experiments still
going on on so many lines, if not quite continuous, all
but. Can't their Lordships wait for their brake until
the Companies have done with their smashes?
A talk about Dover Harbour, which, it seems, is still
under consideration. Their Lordships have a natural
sympathy with piers in difficulties.
(Common*.)—The CHANCELLOR or THE EXCHEQUER,
questioned by MR. CARTWRIGHT, said MR. RIVERS WILSON
would have no objection to take a year's financial en-
gagement under the KHEDIVE, if his place at home
could be kept open for it. But it can't. So it is sup-
posed RIVERS will flow back to native sources—of income.
The Nile is all very well, but Egypt still wants RIVERS
to carry out her financial irrigation scheme.
MR. JAMES (of Gateshead) called the City Companies
over the coals, moved for a great many returns con-
nected with them, and suggested that it was time they
gave an account of their administration of their £500,000
of annual income in the City, lest a worse thing come
upon them, in the shape of the heavy hand of Parliament.
The LORD MAYOR presented himself as a buffer be-
tween MR. JAMES'S fire and the Companies. Nothing
like a Cotton-bag to stop shot. His Lordship spoke
up to his brief. The Guilds.were private associations;
their property private property. They accounted for their
trust funds to the Charity Commissioners; and nobody
had a right to call them to account for more. They
spent £200,000 a year in charity, and the rest in the
best possible manner. (Suppose a good deal went in
dinners. Why not? '* Were they not good dinners?
And did not the good''Companies command good com-
pany ?)
SIB G. BOWYER shot beyond the LORD MAYOR. Parlia-
ment had no right to ask for such information. If the
Guilds were wise, they would refuse to give it. The
demand was unconstitutional, and pessimi exempli.
If there is still a Bowyers' Company, they are bound
to make SIB GEORGE free of it; for truly he draws a good
bow for the Guilds.)
MR. GLADSTONE was down on COTTON, and cut the string
and blunted the shaft of BOWYER. It might not be wise
to pregs for the information just now, when the Com-

DILETTANTISM.
TO THE TRUE CRITIC OF VOCAL MUSIC, ART IS EVERYTHING, AND VOICE IS ONLY A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION. IN FACT, HE
WOULD AS SOON DISPENSE WITH THE LATTER ALTOGETHER, AS THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A BEAUTIFUL ORGAN OFTEN CONSTITUTES A MATERIAL
IMPEDIMENT TO THE SUBTLER AND MORE SPIRITUAL .ESTHETIC SIGNIFICANCE OF REFINED EMOTIONAL INTERPRETATION—WHATEVER ALL
THAT MAY BE.
panieswere unwilling to give it, and Parliament not anxious to get
it. But a time would come when Parliament might be determined
to know, and then the Companies would find they had no choice
but to tell. They would not always be able to put COTTON in the
ears of either Parliament or the Public.
GOLDNEY and NEWDEGATE opposed the Motion. SIR. C. DILKE sup-
ported it.
ME. CROSS was cautious. If any move was to be made in the
matter, it was for Government to make it. ME. JAMES had not made
out any case of mal-administration. Government did not mean to
bring in a Bill, and had no power to insist on the information, so the
matter had better be let drop. So it was let drop—for the present.
But Koompanee-Bahadoor had better set his house in order.
Wednesday.—ME. MACDONALD moved Second Reading of a Bill to
make Employers liable for injuries to Workmen, even when caused
by Managers negligence.
All mining accidents are dne to the neglect of Owners (say
MACDONALD & Co.). All mining accidents are due to the carelessness
of Workmen (say KNOWLES & Co.). Both contentions are false—the
truth lies between them. MB. MACDONALD'S Bill does not hit it.
CROSS, as deus ex machind, admitted the law was not what it
ought_to be. But ME. MACDONAXD'S BilTwould only make a new
injustice. The matter should be referred to a Select Committee, and
the Government should undertake the framing of the Bill on their
Report.
Thursday.—The battle of'the Income-tax, fought out the other
day, was all fought over again, under the conduct of ME. EJBKMAN
HODGSON.
ME. FAWCETT struck a good stroke for the Commons, and against
the Commons Bill. It does not protect, the interests of the
labourers, or provide against illegal enclosures. It leaves too much
in the hands of the Enclosure Commissioners. In short, it ought to
be called the Short Commons Bill; so little does it make adequate
provision for protecting the rights of the millions in the uncultivated
land of England. MR. SANDFORD, LORD E. FITZMAUEICE, MB. COWPEB-
and MB. SHAW - LEFEVBE, followed on the same side;
MR. GOLDNET and MB. KNIGHT against.
ME. CROSS maintained that the Bill took the right ground between
the two, and that, under it, no enclosure could henceforth take place
without sanction of Parliament.
On going into Committee a fierce fight over a motion to report
progress, which lasted, rough-and-tumble fashion, till past two,
when progress, having been impeded all this time, was reported!

worst thing I have ever come across. In tact, he never knew what
a Sea in alt was till now.
"I am not myself at all," said the MaCstro to me one evening, as
the Steward was bringing him a nice basin of hot soup (but he
couldn't stand the association of ideas, and so I ate it myself).
"I 'm not myself at all," says he; "and often wish I were back
again."
I wouldn't lose the chance of an English jeu tJe mat, and gave it
him at once.
"Ah!" saysl: "you don't feel yourself; and you wish you were

I explained it to him, and he smiled. I am with him for the
double purpose of writing an English or American Libretto, and
teaching him English jokes, so that he may grasp our idea of
Burlesque. When he dues grasp it, he '11 be a wiser and a better

week, though he took several composing draughts, without effect.
In spite of the stormy sea the boats, manned by Musicians, came out
to meet us.
Up they went! Such a pitch! Trombones flying, ophicleide up
in the air, the players holding on for their life to the boats, and
OFFENBACH bending over the side of the ship—bowing, as they
thought. It was a picture of the "Ileart bowed dotcn." The
musicianers tried to serenade him, but it wouldn't be serene, and
they would soon have been beyond all aid; so they went back, and
awaited his arrival, which would be his first appearance on any
American Landing-stage. How glad he was to touch terra firma.'
How he enjoyed the change of air, even though the air was Yankee
Doodle. But for a while, after [quitting the ship, he was a wreck;
and though I sang him three of his own songs, I couldn't cheer him
up. So when the people with flags, and lights, and music came to
serenade him at the hotel (they re always serenading people with
lights—I don't knowhowthey treat people without lights—but that's
neither here nor there), I just slipped on a false nose, and a pair
of j)incc-nez, and stepped out on the balcony. In a broken English
voice I said. " Si'r, I thank you," which was received with shouts
and cries of " Chantez, JHossoo! Chantez quelgue chose, out of
your own darned works! Allez, you cuss 1 Go it!"
Then I gave it them. My rendering of " Je suis, moi, le General
Bourn!" was magnificent. I heard poor OFFENBACH calling me to
come in, but the people wanted me to come out.
However, in view of the future, I thought it better to bow and
retire. OFFENBACH thanked me sincerely, and then went to bed.
He is going .to dine at the Lotos Club, and is learning from me
"porter et repondre aux toasts."

GONE WRONG!
A NEW NOVEL. BY MISS RHODY DENDRON,
Authoress of " Cometh Down like a Shower," "Red in the Nose if She,"
"Good! Buy Smeet Tart I" "Not Slily, Sut don't Tell."
CHAPTER THE LAST.— What Jenny says.
_ "MT dear BELLA," I say, after we have left TOMMY'S room—she
first, and myself a quarter of an hour after—" he has given me a
promise of marriage."
"To you.for me?" inquires BELLA, anxiously, with a tender
trouble in the shady depths of her cool, green eyes.
"To me, for myself! " I reply, with quiet triumph, and giving an
instance of the great common sense for which I have always been so
justly celebrated. Then I add, " In two days' time we shall be
married. Had he refused, I should have written to his Bishop, and
exposed him."
And what am I to do ?" asks BELLA, with a mutinous pout.
"Good Heavens!" I reply; "send to ORLISS, or PERCY, or
DUSOVEB, or"—I add, cynically—" some new fellow."
She pauses for a moment; then, sitting down at the table, she
sends a telegram to ORLISS GWYNNIN.
******
In less than an hour ORLISS is at her side. He has come from the
Antipodes, and travelled post-haste. The difference of time allows
of his arrival here exactly two days and a half before the letter was
written to which his coming is the answer. This, at another time,
might have caused a muddle; it does not do so now. He is welcome.
******
The REV. THOMAS HASSOCK, dressed in white goloshes, and peer-
ing, happilv, with little pink eyes through pale green spectacles,
takes me, JKNNY ST. JOHN VILLARS, to wife, marrying me himself,
to save the fees. Then he puts on his surplice, and performs the
ceremony for PERCY SHORTWYND, who has presented himself in the
full uniform—now as seldom seen as the Archbishop's coronation robes
on the very stateliest of state occasions, and then solely and only
when occurring on the first of May—of one of " My Lords;" while
the LADY VIRGINIA CREEFEK is a triumph of red and white
flowers, of glorious gold and silver spangles, with a long bright
ladle in herliand (presented to her as a wedding present by SIB GUY
FOCKSDAY), in which to collect the offerings of the devoted peasantry.
ORLISS GWYNNIN is the best man, and makes himself very amusing,
appearing in his yeomanry costume (of white with red spots and
stripes) of the Drollshire Merriinen, the motto on the cap being1,
in old Norman French, "Nous voysy ongkor.'"—while BELLA is
the chief bridesmaid. Then BELLA is married to ORLISS, and my
husband, TOMMY HASSOCK, acting upon my common-sense sug-
gestion, takes the fees'for this also; and, during the intervals and
pauses, he plays appropriate tunes on the concertina, thus dis-
pensing with the services of the organist, (to whose honorarium my
husband became thereby entitled), while I, with great care, officiate
as clerk, make the necessary reponses, and pocket the gratuities.
The REV. THOMAS HASSOCK will bless the day when he married
so experienced, so steady, so sensible a person as Miss JENNY
ST. JOHN VILLAHS, elder sister of BELLA, and hitherto a sort of
Cinderella in the family. Sometimes I catch him in corners sigh-
ing, and then I make him give me a kiss on my sweet, soft, shy lips.
******
As [for BELLA I believe she is getting on happily enough with
ORLISS GWYNNTN; but, since our marriage, as my husband is very
much taken up with parish work and visiting, and as I never allow
him to go. anywhere without me, we have been compelled to be
"out" to the GWYNNINS whenever they have called. 1 don't think
ORLISS is well off, and BELLA hasn't a farthing. They profess to

superior to men. Give us the same lift, old man, on the Turf.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S DREAM OF THE DERBY.

*
FTER much considera-
tion. Punch made
up his mind this
year not to go to
the Derby. In the
first place he had
been so often be-
fore. He knew the
road by heart, or,
rather, by head. He
remembered that
lobster-salad and
salmon always made
him ill—that they
were poisons that
had only one anti-
dote — soda-water.
He hated the rail
with its hurry and bustle, and he was afraid
of the East wind. So, when a deputation of
the bravest and the noblest in the land (on
bended knees) implored him to act as whip to
their drag, he pursed up his lips, wiped away
a furtive tear, and replied "No." The depu-
tation knew their man. They felt that when
Punch had answered in the negative, that
there was no hope of altering his determina-
tion, so they bowed, wept bitterly, and retired.
A few days later there was a knock at
Punch's study door. It was repeated again
and again, for the Sage was very fast asleep—
he had been reading the Saturday Rertew.
When Punch regained consciousness, Toby
was standing before him. The Dog of Dogs
was dressed in his best; he wore the livery of
his master.
"You must come, Sir," said Toby. "All

the world will be there, and you will disappoint the people in its millions if you do not
smile upon them, even as the sun in its azure blue smiles upon the feathered songsters of
the grove."
"Toby," replied Punch, severely. "you have been reading*a leading article written by a
word-painter." The Dog blushed. "And'now what do you want?"
'.It's the Derby Day, Master, and you ought to go to Epsom."
'I can't,'' said Punch. "I have declared I won't go."
'jWhich is the very reason why you will go. Come, Sir, it is the way of the7world.
Derby promises are made, like treaties—only to be broken."
'Oh, but I have done the thing so often," urged Punch. "I know what I shall see."
'No you don't," replied Toby, firmly, but respectfully. "I have everything ready, and
I promise you that you shall enjoy a novel sensation. I am perfectly unselfish in the matter.
I shall certainly turn my back upon the race whilo it's being run. /only care for the Dog's
Derby—need I say that I allude to the Waterloo Cup? Come, Sir, you snail go."
Thus urged, the Sage arose, and having adopted a suitable costume, sallied forth.
"Where's tho drag?" he asked, when
he found himself in the road.
"Here, Master," replwd Toby, pointing
to a large hamper. "The lunoh is the real
Derby Drag—especially next morning."
Before Punch could reply, two charm-
ing young ladies seated themselves in the
novel conveyance. One was a delightful
brunette, with a pure Italian 'skin, and
shining, hazel eyes; the other a handsome
blonde.
"My dear"girls,".exclaimed Punch, "I
really don't think the Derby is quite the
place for"
"For us!" interrupted the Brunette.
"My dear Sir, don't you know that the
highest Ladies in the land patronise the
race now-a-days?"
"And you forget Woman's Rights," put
in the Blonde. Surely, after the meeting
at St. George's Hall, you must be convinced
that Ladres having claimed the deference
Eaid to weakness, ought to enjoy the privi-
:ge, until now yielded to strength and
power?"
Punch would have argued this point, had
not his attention been attracted to the
strange "steeds" that were being harnessed
to his hamper. Four large lobsters com-
posed the team.
"Dear me!" cried the Sage; "where
did vou get these from?"
"Not from the Westminster Aquarium,"
replied Toby, promptly. "After.the race
you know, Master, a raw lobster very often
carries you back to Epsom."
"Yes!" murmured Punch. "But
surely night-mares should be kept for the
Oaks."
"And if lobsters take you to Epsom after
the race, why shouldn't they hurry you
there before it?"
And then the strange conveyance started.
Toby had promised his Master a new view
of the road; and the Dog of Dogs kept his
word. Instead of the thousand carts and
carriages that usually appear on the Queen's
highway on the Derby Day, scarcely a
vehicle was visible. Punch noticed there
were a very large number of foreigners
making their way to Epsom. A swarthy
Gentleman, wearing a cap, strongly re-
minding him of a Tarn o Shanter oonnet,
plus a tassel, particularly attracted his
notice. This swarthy Gentleman had two
silent companions in attendance upon him.
"Ah, Punch!" said he, "here we are
safe and sound in England! Better off than
the peasants I left under the turf in Spain,
eh P My staff—Oh, don't be frightened;
they won't hurt you: at least, they didn't
hurt ME! Allow me to introduce Monarchy
and Fatherland.
"Impostors!" exclaimed Punch, as he
left the would-be regal Spaniard and his
companions in the distance, "Monarchy
and Fatherland, indeed! He should have
said, Self And Treason."
And now a very tall man indeed neared
Punch's conveyance. The very tall man
had a long moustache, and looked like the
Cousin-German of an Irishman.
"Surprised to see me at the Derby, Mr.
Punch t" he said, with a smile. "Why
should you be? You and I are the wisest
men in the world; and you are here. Be-
sides, you must remember that I am
ubiquitous. I should have been here last
year, hadn't that fellow ABNDK kept me
tied to Germany."

neighbourhood. Toby shouted to him the latest odds.

caught up the habit from you. But you see, Sir, that they do not
always pluck the pigeons they attempt to ensnare."
And then Punch observed that, thanks to COLONEL HENDERSON,
those worst of horse-flies, who throng the turf whereon races are
held, the London Roughs, were kept well in check by those most
useful of Blue-bottles, the Police of the Metropolis, and he noticed
that the tips of the sporting papers were easily recognised as the
dirtiest of bubbles, and he saw that the delights of the Derby were
the most toothsome of food and the dryest of champagne, and
he would doubtless have seen a great deal more had there not been
a cry of " They 're off!"
Down rushed the horses in a little cloud of colour. For a moment
they were seen and then they disappeared. But they came again,
and amidst most tremendous excitement and cheering, the judge
announced the number of the winner!
"Who has won P" cried Punch, eagerly.
"Why, I will tell you," replied Toby. "The winner is"
And at this point the Sage of Fleet Street awoke—Punch's dream
of the Derby was over!

world, but it may be discovered on the
Derby Day. It is the very time to do a
little useful business. Exempli gratia :—
^ You may call on LORD DERBY at the
Foreign OFFICE, and find him ready to
listen to your views about the Herzegovina.
You may, in like manner, enlighten SIB
STAFFORD NORTUCOTE on the difficult ques-
tion of Egyptian Finance.
You may look in at the Stock Exchange,
and show its Chairman the immense im-
portance of reforming that influential esta-
blishment.
You may have a quiet day of study at the
Reading-room of the British Museum, with
that polite Gentleman, the Principal Libra-
rian, in constant attendance upon you.
You may pass a happy nour at the
Academy in front of MR. POYNTER'S picture,
calculating how long it will take MILANIOX
to fall on his nose.
You may climb to the gallery of Saint
Paul's, and look down upon a deserted
City.
You may have a river steamer all to
yourself from London Bridge to Rich-
mond, and dine in delightful isolation at
the "Star and Garter."
You may travel by Rail without the least
fear of being in a carriage with an un-
protected ana aggressive female.
You may walk along Pall Mall, and not
see a human being you know.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
TTMPH! Nothing to yield a drop of Essence in the Lords on
Monday, May 29.
(Commons.)—ME. CALLAN means to move for a Select
Committee to subject Bubble Companies to the same pricking
as Foreign Loans have gone through. Emma Mines, Lisbon
Tramways, and similar swindles, promise a rich crop of
revelation under the operation of JAMES'S Powders. But
one hardly dares to hope there can be any legal punishment
for "financial enterprise" that has robbed to the tune of
millions.
The writ for Norwich is to he suspended, till that borough
has repented in its native crape—if not in sackcloth and
ashes. The same Bill will disfranchise the scheduled voters
for Boston.
MR. MITCHELL-HENRY moved a Resolution declaring that
no financial arrangements can be satisfactory which do not
relieve Ireland from a burden of taxation,
beyond her ability to pay, as compared
with Great Britain. As the taxes levied
in the Green Isle and the rest of the United
Kingdom are the same—except the Assessed
Taxes, from which Ireland is exempt—it
is not easy to say where the injustice lies.
But PADDY is at liberty to fit the burden
to his own back. Let him drink less
whiskey, and he will contribute so much
less to the Imperial Exchequer.
Ma. HZNKY did not venture on a division.
In Committee on the Commons Bill. As
the law stands, if a Lord of the Manor and
the Commoners agree, a Common can be
enclosed without sanction of Parliament.
This leaves out of sight the public interest
in the enjoyment of Commons, which does
not constitute a legal right.
ME. SHAW-LEFEVRE tried in vain to
press an enactment that henceforth no
enclosure of a common, town or village
green, shall be legal, except under the
statute. "Prqpputty, propputty!". was
trotted out against him by M it. CROSS.
(Happily Commoners are growing more
wide-awake than of old, and there is less
prospect of the lord being allowed to have
his own way with the waste than there
used to be. The great point is to give us
Enclosure Commissioners who understand
the importance of protecting open spaces
wherever they are wanted for public enjoyment, health, 'and recreation. That the Bill, with all its shortcomings, will forward. It
might be better, but it is good as far as it goes.)
Tuesday (Lords).—LORD DONOUGHMORE moved Resolutions for the amendment of the Irish Grand Jury system. The DTTXE OP RICH-
MOND had little to say against them but that they must be embodied in a Bill which must originate in the House of Commons. The
1.1 HIii CHANCELLOR admitted that the discussion had shown the need of an amendment of the law: BO the Resolutions, though withdrawn,
were not moved to no purpose.
A conversation about Foreign Titles conferred on English subjects elicited from LORD DERBY the rather startlingadmission^hat there
is no legal penalty for the assumption of a title to which a man has no right. (Punch never assumes his Foreign Titles in this country,
much as Judy has pined to be presented as LA MARCHESA DE PoLiNcrNELLO, and recommends his friends of the Upper House to follow
his example.) His Lordship confirmed the startling news of the deposition of the SULTAN. (ABDUL Aziz—as some hundreds of his
indefatigaole correspondents have already taken care to inform Mr. Punch—is now ABDUL as was. The Softas have settled the revo-
lution in the softest style. MOURAD THE FIFTH is now Commander of the Faithful. May the elevation not invest him with another title,
already familiar to Eastern story—MOURAD THE UNLUCKY. We are informed that he passed the four weeks previous to his accession in
a cellar. He may yet regret even that calm and secluded retreat. On the time-honoured principle that " When things are at their worst
they'll mend," the change must be an improvement; which, no doubt, accounts for the jump up of Turkish Stock from nine to
fourteen on receipt of the telegram, and the general rejoicing which seems to have hailed the news, at Constantinople and elsewhere.)
(Common*.)—After this stirring news had been confirmed by MR. BOITRKTE, the House was recalled from its excitement by MR.
DISRAELI'S curt Motion for adjournment over the Derby Day, on which SIR WILFRID had his usual innings. He scored his first
laugh by claiming the Motion for a Party one—" supported by the party of sentiment and opposed by the party of sense." He must
have meant the Amendment. He denied that he had been seen at the Derby in a scarlet coat and a green tie. He quoted from the
Daily Telegraph a summary description of Epsom Downs on the Derby Day, as "the grandest assemblage of blackguardism on the
face of the earth," with the comical comment, a few lines further on, tnat " the sight is one of the prettiest in the world." He asked
for votes against "a proceeding which was somewhat inconvenient, slightly mischievous, altogether childish, and thoroughly con-
temptible."
MR. BROMLEY-DAVENPORT said he had gone to the Derby for twenty years, and meant to go to-morrow. The Derby was a
general holiday, and he did not see why Members should not have the chance of enjoying it. When he was at Hyde Park Corner, in
the evening of last Derby Day, he saw a carriage pass with a gentleman in it, rather dusty, and apparently very cheerful, bearing a
most remarkable resemblance to the Honourable Member, and carrying a doll in his hat.
_ MR. ASSHETON deprecated jocularity. He denied that the custom of adjourning over the Derby Day was either good or old. He
believed the time would come when people would wonder that so late as 1876 the House of Commons in its busiest time adjourned its
proceedings for a whole day to see a horse race. (Punch hasn't a doubt of it, by the time when cakes and ale are things of thepast.)
MR. BRIGHT followed MR. ASSHETON'S grave lead, and gave the House a weighty lecture on the evils of horse-racing. He believed
that the character of the House would stand higher in the country, and wherever their debates were read, if they abandoned the
custom the Right Honourable Gentleman proposed they should follow now. (So does Punch, with one qualification, however—that
the sense and morality of the country shall have grown pari-passu with that of the.House. In the meantime, Punch fears that a taste

THE APPEAL OF THE PIOUS FOUNDER.
the Ghost of a Pious Founder stood
By COTTON'S couch, in the night-watch dim,
Above his brow it seemed to brood,
Then thus did make appeal to him :—
"Oh sturdy champion of civic right,
Yet a little let reason give thee pause,
Provoke not a more than doubtful fight,
Nor valour waste in a hopeless cause!
""We built, you inherit; and all our aim
Was within the ring of the Public Weal.
Time changes. You seekers of civic fame
Have with other duties and days to deal.
Make not our names mere snares to trip
The feet whoso progress we sought to speed,
And let not Prerogative's jealous grip
Minister only to pride and greed!"
With wrath COTTON'S hair stood up, but—" Nay,"
(luoth the mild Shade, "pray, be not wroth!
You 're all of you hon'rable, I dare say,
But why to the proof of the fact so loth?
'Tis clear public purpose bars private right,
Of that truth though you and BOWIER are scorners;
Be wise ; up windows and let in the light,
Cobwebs may lurk in some odd corners!
"Where Craft, Commerce, Charity, Culture you aid,
What need for striving inquiry to muzzle?

Are given to the joys of glare and guzzle?

Do you plead a per contra? You 've done your best?
Then put it to proof. No escape from that.
The public trust waits the public test.

Ere the cry you gird at waxes louder.

House of Commons represents the lower propensities of the country.)
ME. POWBE declared that if any Irish Member dared to oppose the
adjournment, he would out him—an awful contingency!—and that
if Ireland had her native Parliament, on Palace Green, it would
adjourn over every Derby Day in the year.
Finally, the House declared it did want to go to the Derby by 118
to 207. SIK WILFBID'S minority is on the rise.
A long discussion on the case of a Sub-Inspector of Irish Consta-
bulary dismissed in 1867. SIR M. H. BEACH promised to look into
the case. There is some "justice for Ireland, after all.
Ma. THKVELYAN, in a House of not much over a dozen, moved two
Resolutions: one for Equalisation of the Borough and County Fran-
chise; the other for Redistribution, with a view to more complete
representation of the electoral body. His reasons for, were better
than MR. LOWE'S against; and ME. BRIGHT backed him up in the
best speech he has made this Session.
Ms. DISRAELI rode off on Redistribution, and the House (which
had filled for division and to hear BRIGHT) followed him, throwing
out the first Resolution by 2fri to 165, and the mover withdrawing
the second. Quid plura f Time will be: Time is not now.
Thursday (Lords).—The LORD CHANCELLOR introduced his Bank-
ruptcy Bill. The old Act, in handing over arrangements in Bank-
ruptcy to creditors, had too often handed over bankrupt estates to
the trustees. The new Bill will empower creditors to appoint com-
mittees of inspection, who will nominate the trustee and look after
him; and estates won't be allowed more than two years for liquida-
tion. After that they must be handed over to the Court. As it is,
they are left in trustees' hands till they get liquidated in the original
sense of melting away altogether.
(Commons.)—On Commons. CROSS held his own against all
amenders.
CROSS introduced his Prisons Bill—to put our gaols on a more
uniform footing as regards diet, discipline, and cost; and to that
end empowering Government to take into its own hands the whole
cost, control, and management of prisoners from the date of their
committals. This, it was calculated, would save £392,000 to Local
Rates, if it added £285,000 to Imperial expenditure. A balance of
some hundred thousand to the good; to say nothing of the improve-
ment in prison discipline and administration. Bravo, Caoss!

Ethel (to Papa, who has been to Luiiclifon). "You 'VE NOT MISSED MUCH, PAPA. THKBE HAS
ONLY BBEN ONE HAN IN TUB BuoOK, AND TWO TUMBLES AT THE HuilDLES!"
DEKBY STAND-POINTS.
IT is perhaps needless to remark that Mr. Punch has received an enormous number of
descriptions o± last Wednesday's race. From the great mass of such contributions Mr. Punch
has selected two, which he presents to the public, that they may strike an average between
them:—
SIB, June 1, 1876.
NEVER again! I have now seen the race several times, and on every occasion I have
vowed it should be for the last time. Yet this year, on Wednesday last, I found myself in
a hamsom with WALLIS— WILLIAM WALLIS—and a hamper. Never go to the Derby in a
hansom! In the first place, you have no room for your legs; in the second place, if you ride
(as we did) four miles behind a van, your cab will become a receptacle for a sufficient amount
of peas to provide soup for the whole British Army; and, thirdly, it is ten to one that your
companion will (as mine did) want to smoke strong cigars the whole way down and back. I
need hardly say that WILLIAJI felt thirsty at an early period of the day, and insisted upon
opening the hamper, when we of course discovered we had no corkscrew. A blow from the
Cabman's whip soon got over this difficulty, though if the incident had taken place anywhere
except in front of my partner's villa at Clapham, I should have been better pleased. The
Press gentlemen, who are paid for it, always rave about the beauties of the road. I have
never seen anything except scrubby hedges, Cockney villas, and an unconscionable amount
of dust. Also the spectacle of several thousand ramshackle vehicles with their more dis-
gusting occupants, is not one to raise the mind to good and noble thoughts.
We got to the Downs, had some lunch, and left the hamper in care of the cabman. I
soon lost my friend, and had to wander about by myself. Good heavens, Sir! what does a
man go to the Derby for? If he enjoys having his coat brushed against his will; being
pestered by tawdry women thrusting decayed vegetables in his face that may once have
been roses; hearing the inanities of minstrels whose natural dirt one would think would
have rendered burnt cork superfluous; being invited to spot the king or to point out the
little pea; being sworn at for getting in the way of those idiots who are shying at cocoa-
nuts; being grilled alive by a fiery sun, and narrowly escaping being run over by the
drags of a bloated aristocracy—if, Sir, he enjoys all this, he is fool enough for anything;
and if he doesn't enjov it, he is ten times bigger fool for not being comfortably at home.
Just before the race, I started to run down the hill. In my haste I dodged under a carriage.
"That's him! Stop thief! hold him tight!" were what I heard; and then next moment
I was seized by two policemen, and accused of having stolen a bracelet! In vain I protested;
I had been seen to do it: and if it had not been for the arrival of another policeman with
the real offender and the bracelet, it would have gone hard for me. As soon as I was
released I heard a yell, and, on turning round, saw the number " 7"
What! The Race over! I had not seen it; and Kisber first!
*••#•«#*
On the drive homo I will not dilate. BILL was, as he put it, "on," the Cabman (as
he put it) had " copped the brewer"; both of them (as /put it) were in a hopeless state of
intoxication. The usual amenities of the road took place. Suffice it to say, that as, at half-
past eight, wo drove up Grosvenor Place,
my companions only capable of being used
as illustrations to a lecture on the Ghastly
Results of Intemperance, and I with my
clothes covered with flour, my face a mass
of soot, and my hat bashed in with a coooa-
nutj I saw on a balcony a lady to whom,
during a sat-out dance on Monday, I had,
in my most blase manner, declared the
Derby only fit for boys. She saw me!
The Cabman asked more than the appointed
fare, and, on my refusal to pay, did, at
BILL'S instigation, hit me in the eye.
Sir, in conclusion, the Derby Day is a
humbug! the House of Commons, for ad-
journing, is a humbug! and yon, Sir, arc
the greatest humbug of all for encouraging
in Cartoon, prose, and verse, an effete and
exploded idiocy.

finest horses and carts I ever saw in the
whole of life. Some had four horses, some
one donkey. We sang " Tommie, make
rooms for my Uncle " the whole possible
way there. We had a fine place, and saw
the race noble. When my country's horse
won, I threw my hat (white) in the air, and
never saw it again. After lunch we had
larks. I got a jolly blow on my head from
a man playing Aunt Silly. A Swell threw
lobster-salad over me. I talked to several
grandes dames in carriages, who gave me
champagne. It was not good, but the
English nobles are not so high exclusive as
peoples say. We had great fun back with
squirts and 'pea-shooters. I took my coat
off and fought a man, and was knocked
down stunning. Hurrah for the Darby.
I shall always go. Next year, with my
wife—in Hungary of course. I saw twice so
many carriages go home that went down.

your very good healths.

BOAT, 'tis a good derivation,
With beauty and power, if not truth,
For the East wind is forced to cessation,
And the year's in its lusty hot youth.

And wander on Whitsuntide waters
'Mid glory of June.
Comes music from many a villa,
Where they dance on the tree-shaded

The swan leads his cygnet-flotilla,
And hisses at boats as they pass:
Save Hesperus, twilight is starless
In the light of a fast-growing moon,
As we loiter awhile, not cigarless,
In silence of June.

Away to the /ephyrs be flung:
Accept the fair season's soft joyance;
In the breath of the youth-month grow

THE SCIENCE SHOW, SOUTH KENSINGTON.
THE following Notes are extracted from a Catalogue found by the
Police in the Exhibition of Scientific Apparatus, now open at South
Kensington. There is no name in the Catalogue—"Puffing Billy"
scribbled on the title-page appears to refer to a venerable steam-
engine—but the owner was evidently a man of an independent and
original mind, disposed to view the instruments in the Collection in
novel aspects, and not tied and bound to any preconceived scientific
theories, or overridden by narrow intellectual assumptions. Certain
of those who have had the privilege of examining this Catalogue
and its marginal Notes, seem to think that some at least of them may
have been made without the writer seeing the objects they refer to—
a question of considerable importance, on which we should be glad
to receive the opinions of learned bodies and distinguished men of
science both at home and abroad.
Notes.
"Slide Rule." As this instrument may be applied (among other
purposes) "to find areas," no Policeman, who has a proper regard
tor his own comfort and happiness, ought to be without one.
"Napier Bones." Mysterious, dismal, chilly. To which of the
many celebrated NATIERS did these bones belong, and how is it that
they are not in their natural resting-place?
Instruments of Precision." Invaluable to those innumerable
vague persons of both sexes, who are totally unable to detail what
they hear, read, or see, in any accurate, clear, or intelligible manner.
But can they be taught how to use these instruments'(
"Plotting Scales. Harmless enough here, but likely to arouse
suspicion in countries fertile in conspiracies, secret societies, and
revolutions.
"The Wealemefna." What can this be? A new patent medicine,
or hair-dye, or a strange wild animal from India, would clearly be
out of place in a Collection of this character. Perhaps it is another
sewing machine.
"M&asures of Capacity." What a.boon to constituencies choosing
new Members, masters and mistresses engaging fresh servants
youthful persons of both sexes selecting partners for life, and
parents determining on the future career of their progeny!
"Delicate pressure Gauge." By the aid of this ingenious instru-
ment, a diffident man will be able to estimate exactly the amount of
encouragement he may derive from the "delicate pressure" of his
hand by the beautiful being who is the source of all his thoughts,
dreams, schemes, hopes, fears, and palpitations.
"VON JOLLY'S Spring-balance." The mere title puts one in
spirits for the whole of the day. We forget the lateness of the
season, and the North-East wind, and the Eastern Question, and
everything else that is uncomfortable and depressing.
"A 12-mile Protractor." Consult PAYSON WESTON, or some other
eminent pedestrian, as to the uses and advantages of this instrument,
before going into training.
"'s. GKAVESANDE'S Apparatus to demonstrate the Theory of the
Wedge." There is something irresistibly fascinating and provoking
to the curiosity about that initial "'s." Does the Theory of the
Wedge apply to the whole, or only the thin end of it?
"Soldier Experiment." Strongly recommended to the notice of
the Horse Guards and War Office.
"Revolution Indicator." Must be of the greatest possible service
in countries, where Revolutions occur with a frequency to make some
sure warning of their approach invaluable to those inhabitants who
are wise enough to sell out of the Funds and change their residence.
"Whistles for producing Shrill Notes." Any one who has the
misfortune to live near a railway will condemn these as a superfluous
and terrible invention.
"Set of Vowel Forks." The attendant, on being asked why this
set was incomplete—there being no Consonant Knives—was mjute.
"Siren," and "Double Siren" (see HUM Kit's Odyssey). Sure to
draw enormous crowds. Except, perhaps, a Mermaid, the origi-
nators of the exhibition could not have sought and obtained a greater
attraction. (They are perfectly harmless.) With the ample material
at their disposal, the Committee might arrange a most telling con-
cert. The Sirens, of course, would be the principal vocalists, the

Where is this "red hot Copper Railway " to be found? What par

Does it pay any dividend?
Here, for the present, we must pause in our extracts from these
Notes; first recommending pages 20—22, 76—86, and 332—342 o
the Catalogue as light and pleasant reading for leisure moments.
BOOKS AND BRAIN-WOEK.
A WONDERFUL instrument, said to havebeen invented by DR. Mosso,
of Turin, was described the other day by DR. GASKELL, at a Con-
ference connected with the " Biology " section of the Loan Collection
of Scientific Instruments at South Kensington. It appears to be a
register chiefly for measuring the fulness of the limbs—-hence named
the Plethysmograph. According to a summary of its description :—
"The whole of the fore-arm is immersed in water in a glass vessel, and the
cover of india-rubber grasps the arm with a water-tight grip. Erery enlarge-
ment or contraction of the arm by the inflow of additional blood, or the
withdrawal of the usual amount, causes a difference in the bulk of the arm,
which affects the pressure on the water. This is connected by a pipe with a
recorder."
Cut bono ?—the present reader will not inquire, for the reader of
Punch never asks a shallow question. If it were asked, however,
the following reply, as far as it goes, may be deemed more—or less
—satisfactory.
"If a demand is made for blood in the brain by unusual brain action, it is
necessarily withdrawn from the extremities; hence it is claimed that this
apparatus can be used for testing the intensity of brain action. It is stated
that a classical scholar tested with a Latin and Greek book showed more blood
needed for brain-work to read Greek than Latin."
A picture of the classical scholar as he appeared sitting~with his
arm in a Plethysmograph, and being tested thereby, might be
executed with effect by a humorous artist. It would represent an
experiment of literary and scientific value, which could no doubt be
estimated by a sufficient scholar and competent philosopher laying
their heads together. But. perhaps, before drawing any conclusions
From the indications of the Plethysmograph of the comparative
quantity of blood needed by the brain for brain-work performed in
reading, severally, a Latin book and a Greek book, they would like
to know what books the Greek book and the Latin book respectively
were. Even a sohool-boy in a low form could inform a philosopher
who knew not, or did not consider, that some Latin books are
tiarder work to read than some Greek books, as well as vice versa.
[leading the former, therefore, would, according to the theory of
the Plethysmograph, cause the brain to attract to itself the greater
quantity of blood, as recorded by that ingenious contrivance. If the
Plethysmograph can be trusted, its application to the works of con-
temporary writers would be interesting. A stupid book, however,
may be harder work to read than a clever one. On the other hand,
f thought is brain-work, the study of some very popular writings
would not perhaps be found attended with any extraordinary
determination of blood to the brain.

CLUBS! CLUBS!

"IN the name of the Prophet, Figs!"
When the Caireen higgler cried,
'Twas from sublime to ridiculous
Rebuked as a sudden stride.
But our cry is now, through all classes and
crafts,
From senators to subs,
Tory swells to Radical working-men.
"In the name of the profit, Clubs!"
Such virtue in Co-operation is,
Such advantage in prime cost,
Invest upon Club principles.
And your money can't be lost.
From London's dung-hill cryptogamous
Club-moss may be'said to grow:
We have streets of Clubs, and squares of
Clubs,
Big and little, high and low.
Like mushrooms, they want little root;
Strange food they seem to swallow:
At the game of the day you must follow suit,
And^' Clubs" is the suit to follow.
Are you a Swell? You must have your
Club;
That you 're not a Snob to tell.
Are you a Snob? You must have your
Club;
To show that you are a Swell.
And in this universal suit,
In spite of snubs and rubs,
You '11 find each thinks the Club he
holds
The highest card in Clubs.
Till one may say, that High or Low,
Jack, Game, all round the ring,
Each, if asked to give his Club a name,
Of Clubs would call it King.
And if the Ladies had their rights,
And petticoat-Clubs were seen,
The Ladies all would be pulling caps,
Each of Clubs to prove hers'the Queen.
There "s only one court-card in Clubs
That I fancy all would waive;
So suppose we started that, and called
Our Club of Clubs the Knave!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL

AT MADAME TUSSAUD'S.
"OH, UNCLE OEOROE! Do THIY KILL THEM BEFORE THEY STUW THEM?'
IMPORTANT OFFICIAL LNQUIEY.
MK. BsomBr-DAVEHPORi's insinuation that SIR Wmrajro LAWSOX visited the Derby last
year, and returned "somewhat dusty, very cheerful, and with a doll in^his hat," induced
Mr. Punch to institute an inquiry as to •whether the Honourable Baronet'went to the Derby
this year. The following is an abstract of the evidence taken:—
A Gentleman could al most be positive that the Honourable Baronet sat opposite to him in
a train going to Epsom, but his face was partly concealed by a newspaper, The Morniny
Advertiser, which fie was intently perusing. Could not swear that it was SIR WILFRED.
A Purveyor of Refreshments said that a Gentleman answering to the description of the
Member for Carlisle called for a bottle of Champagne, and drank it all himself. He
observed it was a great shame that Champagne-bottles did not hold an imperial quart.
After he left, some one said it was SIB WILMED LAWSOW, or Ba WILLIAM DAWSON: could
not be sure which.
A Gipsy Fortnne-Teller said she fancied she knew the "pretty gentleman." He crossed
her hand with silver, and was very funny. She asked the first letter of his first name, and
he said " W." She then told him that if he would be serious, and there was nobody else in
the world, he might some day become a great man. This seemed to affect him greatly.
Hardly thought sixpence enough for such information. Perhaps some other pretty gentle-
man would cross her nand. She thought she saw a gent in the chair who liked to kiss a
pretty girl in a corner." (Ordered out of the room.)
A Chemist of Epsom gave evidence that a Gentleman came into his shop on the after-
noon of the Derby Day, and asked for something to cure the "hiccups, which he said
were the result of imprudently drinking some cold water. The Gentleman could stand
quite steady by holding on to a chair. Thought it might have been the Honourable Baronet,
because he fancied, while he was mixing the draught, he heard something like " WILFBID,
my boy (hie), this is very (hie) bad form.
A Hansom-Cab Driver deposed to having driven a 'Gentleman answering the description
from Epsom, and on arriving in town he was told to drive to the House of Commons. The
House was closed, and the Gentleman, who seemed pretty comfortable, said, "Of course,
yes; I forgot. Jfever mind; better luck next year." He was discharged at West-
minster Hall. The next day he found a pocket corkscrew, with the initials "W. L.,"
in his cab.
Finally, a person gave evidence that the Honourable Baronet, or some one very like him,
wound up his watch in St. James's Park
the next day after the race, and set it by
the Horse Guards'clock. • "•
Mr. Punch does not consider the above
evidence sufficient for him to come to a
decision upon, but must ask the public to
form their own conclusions on this most im-
portant matter.
PROPERTY AND .COMMONS.
NEVER mind scenery,
Foliage and greenery.
Plants with machinery
Raise in their lieu.
All but utility
Deem imbecility,
Dotage, anility,
Scorn and eschew.
Commons, what use on 'e^m,
Save to the goose on 'em'(
Cattle run loose on 'em,
Vagrants abound.
Village brats play on 'em,
Jackasses bray on "em,
Going astray on 'em.
Clapped in the Pound.
Sweep gorse and heather, all,
Off them together, all,
Break them up, whether all
Good land, or no.
Build over wild and waste;
Once flowery paths effaced,
With smart new streets replaced,
Terrace and row.
Our Regulation Bill,
Scarce Conservation Bill—
—Slight Limitation Bill,
E'en let it pass,
And not at least impede,
If not enclosure speed,
Soon may no Common feed
Or goose) or ass.
Not common lands would we
Keep, as Conservers, fre*.
But claims of Property
'Gainst them uphold.
Let sentimental swains
Weep for their silent plains,
Lone glades, and glens, and lanes,
Woodland ana wold.
Let the tall chimneys rise,
Let them begrime the skies,
While they regale our eyes.
Old England may
Grow, as her face they blur,
So bards and fools arer,
Richer and uglier
Every day.
Nothing Like Lucidity.

PARISH RELIEF.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,
SITRELY SIR THOMAS BROWNE, had he lived in these days,
would have included amongst "Vulgar Errors" the common idea
of the duties of a " Relieving Officer.'' This mistake, dear Sir, you
may observe made in a communication from "A COUNTRY PARSON"
to the Daily News. It is one which Clergymen in general, as a
class, mostly labour under—a peculiarly clerical error. The
"COUNTRY PARSON " airs his fallacy in the following anecdote :—
"A case lately occurred hi my parish that bears out what I say. A poor
man was suffering from an abscess in his neck, nnd the Doctor ' ordered,' or
rather * recommended,' a certain quantity of mutton and ale every day, which,
the Doctor told me,'he ought to have." The Relieving Officer, however, did
not think so; but gave only what he thought proper; awaiting leave from the
Board, that met ten days later, to give the full amount of relief recommended
by the Doctor. I remonstrated with the Board, telling them in, truth that a
sick horse or a sick cow would faro better in like circumstances, but to no
purpose; they would screen their officer from all blame."
He then wrote to the Local Government Board, but the Local
Government Board screened the Board of Guardians. The Board
above upheld the Board below. Of course. He invoked the aid of
an influential Peer who shared his, misconception of a Relieving
Officer's functions—but in vain. The noble Lord was too busy to
attempt an unwise interference.
The "COUNTRY PARSON " prefaces his case, as above stated, with
a perfectly true remark :—
1 It is needless to Say that . . . when a Bick man has to wait nearly a fort-
night ere leave from the Board can be obtained for the adtninistration of relief
ordered by the Doctor, the poor sufferer has time to wait and to die with-
out it."
Certainly. There is hot the slightest need for saying what is
obvious. Equally unnecessary are the "CoTTSTRY PAMON'S" subse-
quent comments on the misery and suffering which the circumstance
that " the Relieving Officer is not allowed to obey the Doctor's orders
as regards relief to the sick, without leave from the Board of
Guardians," entails on "the sick poor." Of course, a system
essentially penal entails misery and suffering—if it works as it
should.
The "CotmTRY PAKSON," and most other parsons—and persons-
imagine that the Relieving Officer's duty is to relieve the poor. His ,
duty is to relieve the poor no more than he must. He is the Parish
Relieving Officer. His office is to relievo the parish. He has to do
that by administering the minimum of relief to the poor. Relieving
Officers, too many of them, if left to themselves, would too commonly
be Weak enough sometimes to take the vulgar and clerical view of
their business, and fly in the face of parochial philosophy. It would
never do to allow them to execute the orders of doctors at their own
indiscretion. Doctors, in their ideas of what the "sick poor," as they
are called, ought to have, are apt to be quite as extravagant as
parsons. The Guardians have to guard the ratepayers' pockets.
Happily they know how.
As to a " sick horse or a sick cow," how absurd comparing valu-
able stock to paupers! There are indeed horses and cows corre-
sponding to the "sick poor" closely enough; but we can relieve
ourselves of them without any other Relieving Officer than the
Knacker. Parish Guardians are unable to relieve the parish more
directly than they can through a Relieving Officer whose negative
office is limited to the partial negation of relief. No bread at all, not
any other food, would be very much better than half a loaf—to say
nothing of superfluous "nourishment" ordered by the Doctor-
completely to answer the purpose which Relieving Officers are
intended 'for, and ought to serve. That would be at once a true
economy of both human suffering and of the rates. By economising
the latter, dear Sir, we economise the former _to the extent of put-
ting an absolute end to a very great deal of it; and I am sure you
will allow that there is no more efficient Relieving Officer than our
old friend with the scythe and hour-glass. A " draught of his
sleepy wine " is a more perfect anodyne for "them wicious paupers,"
as Mr. Humble called them, than anything the doctor can order.
In relieving them, it relieves the parish of them, and of having to
support them—at some cost even Upon nutriment not more expensive
than
SKILLIGOLEE.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

WHITSUNTIDE holidays!
"How sweet is Rest by honest Labour won.
Pause between work to do, and work well done:
Such rest as, by the leave of Wbitsun weather,
Brings Prince, and Premier, and Punch together,
To quaff cool cups, and crack the genial joke,
And watch, serene, life's troubles end in smoke.
That Punch, and Prince, and Premier are blest,
Whose lines have fallen in the pleasant West:
'Gainst you no Powers combine, no Softas plot;
For you friends wax not cold, insurgents hot:
No midnight fetvah hurls you from your states,
Nor darkling Death on Deposition waits."
In other words, Whitsuntide holidays in St. Stephen's are a very
different thing indeed from Whitsuntide horrors in Stamboul —
whether for Prince, Premier, or Philosopher. You see what a plea-
sant picture the one makes in the pages of Punch. Who could bear
to see faithfully painted the intolerable iniquities of the other?
But holidays will come to an end, and the pleasantest the most
quickly. Ere Punch had fairly inhaled his fill of midsummer air,
scented with hawthorn, he finds himself back again, a busy-bee,
extracting Essence from the flowers of Rhetoric and the fruits of
Legislation, in the Parliamentary parterres of Westminster.
Thursday.—Back to the Commons—the very thing for the Com-
mons, one would have said, unsated with their short Whitsun-
week s holiday. MR. SHAW-LEFEVRE, backed by ME. FAWCETT and
LOUD E. FrrzMATJRlCE, made a gallant struggle to get a fixed mini-
mum of reservation from the waste for recreation-grounds or field-
gardens. MR. CROSS maintained his ground, that it was better to
avoid maxima and minima, and let the amount of reservation in each
case be settled on its own merits.
The misfortune is, that if "De minimi* non curat lex," it may
be feared the Commissioners will be often too like the law they
administer, and go on not caring either.
In answer to MR. FAWCETT, MR. CROSS explained how he meant
to deal with the thirty-four Commons now scheduled for enclosure.
The schemes are to be reported upon by one of the Commissioners—
MR. CAIRD—and a gentleman appointed for the purpose ; and on their
report the arrangements are to be reconsidered.
The County Courts are to have jurisdiction to prevent local en-
closures; but MR. CROSS declined to accept a clause moved by SIB

sanitary authorities are to make bye-laws for manufactories, and

pious tin-founder—has promised £1,300 a year; the BISHOP OF
ExETKR is to ladle £800 out of his see into the Cornish, and a con-
siderable sum has been collected besides in driblets, so that there is
hope that the see will not lack the see-water—aurum potabile—re-
quired to float a Bishop.

A waste of time over the imaginary grievances of MB. HENWOOD,
disappointed naval architect. Ditto over the well-ascertained rule
of each House not to refer to debates in the other, such debates

pointed out, on the rule being evaded, as it must sometimes be
evaded, in a proper Parliamentary and Pickwickian manner—" in

SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL urged the necessity of somehow combining
under one and the same recruiting machinery a short-service system

A good deal of talk, but none to much purpose, on the Army Esti-
mates, which included £17,000 for the rebuilding of Knightsbridge
Barracks, and a vote [for the Martini-Henry Rile, which brought
up the old controversy on its merits as a service-arm; showing the
old and irreconcileable Doctors' differences, which leave lay-people
satisfied that our rifles are very well as they are.
LOGICAL DEMONSTRATION.
THE Temperance Demonstration on Whit Monday in Hyde Park
was a very numerous one. This is gratifying. Its numbers have
multiplied since, no doubt. CARDINAL MANNING is reported to have
said that every one who turns a Temperance-man makes three other
Temperance-men. Turning Temperance-man is your way to promote
Temperance. Such demonstrations as the Hyde Park Temperance
Demonstration demonstrate that Temperance, and not drunkenness
as fabulists assert, is on the increase. It is reasonable to hope that
Temperance will go on increasing amongst the masses, as it has
increased among the higher orders, until it prevails. Temperance
far a da se. Monster Temperance Demonstrations prove in the
meanwhile that, inasmuch as the people are fast taking to Temper-
ance of their own accord, there is not the slightest reason whatever
for trying to make them sober by Act of Parliament. Success to
Monster Temperance Demonstrations!

OUR REPRESENTATIVE AT CAMBRIDGE
Visit* the ancient University on the very important occasion of
conferring a Musical Doctor's degree on an eminent Composer,
and reports.
SIR,
As a son of the
soil — as. I mean,
a Member of the
ancient University
of Cambrid ge, both
of us, of course,
couldn't be absent
on the recent most
interesting occa-
sion of conferring
degrees. If yuu,
Sir, couldn't go,
I was sure to be at
my post. To the

It had been all
arranged, pre-
viously. My influence with the dear virtuous old Vice did it. By
"old Vice," of course, I mean my good old friend, the Vioe-Chau-
cellor, bless him!
"Don't mind me," I wrote to himt in answer to a question of im-
portance, "I '11 coma in for anything or nothing. But give MR.
A&iqirn SuLLTVAir a Doctor's degree. What have you got to spare?
A second-hand gown, and a flat muffin pap will do the trick, and
three-and-sixpence for the loan of them for the first hour, and half-
a-crown afterwards will meet the requirements of the University
Chest, and my illustrious friend can stand it. He 'a the man in all
England to be a Musical Doctor. Do it, dear Vice, do it, and shed
a lustre on your term of office."
From the Vice to your Representative.
Good. Senatus omnis ibi. Fees no object. What will you
*'

take, eh?
Yours,
V. C'
From the Former (Me), to the Latter (Him).
"CHER, V. C.,
"As I said, 'don't mind me.' But since you do ask me
what I '11 take, I reply, I '11 take a 'D.C.L.' or ' L.L.' (KiNAHAJf's),
with a taste of water, cold. No sugar — though, perhaps, entre nous,
mild Scotch is safer. If you want me to take anything else^-well —
I '11 take my oath, if you like, just to show there 's no ill feel-
ing between myself and the University Authorities, in the Senate
House, coram poptilo, as we call the residents in Coram Street.
Yours ever.
P.8. — Have the flags out, and the band. The Composer will arrive
in my care. Sound the trumpets in, Trumpington. Beat the drums,
and jingle the College quadrangles. Sir, it 's a great day for
Cambridge."
Once more the Vice (Dn. PHEAR) wrote " Good. Mind you come.'1
Tp which I wittily replied, " JV*o Phear,—I'U be there."'
Well, Sir, it was a magnificent spectacle. We alighted and pro-
ceeded, amid a perfect ovation, (" ovation" is of Latin derivation,
and in its origin has something to do with eggs — so to give a person
an ovation means " to salute mm with eggs ) — to get into our flv as
quickly as possible, pull up the blinds, and tell the man to drive, like
beans — or old boots," whichever he liked— by the back way into
Trinity. It turned out subsequently — and all 's well that ends well
— that we had been mistaken for some one who had recently done
something very unpopular, and who was consequently execrated — or
I should say execrated by the Undergraduates.
But no matter. The Composer in the fly (which was a trifle damp
and smelt of hay), looked ruefully at me and said, "What shall I do
with these fireworks?" for he was carrying a packet with Catherine
Wheels, and mottoes and inscriptions of " Long Life to SULLIVAN!"
"Vote for the Musical Doctor!" "No more Prescriptions! Take
Notes," and so forth, with a transparency the size of five red silk
pocket-handkerchiefs (old style), representing Britannia and myself
crowning the Composer, pictured in.his Doctor's gown and cap.
"Keep them, my dear friend," I said, "till it s dark. I "m sorry
I can't offer to carry them for you myself, but I know so many
people here that it wouldn't do."
Well, Sir, we drove on a perfectly royal progress, with the blinds
up. Suddenly, as we turned into the Market Place, where the
Martyrs' Memorial — the beautiful Town Pump — stands,* we were

recognised: I mean, the crowd found out who tee weren't. And
then you should have heard the cheers.
"You must give 'em largesse," said I to the Future Musical
Doctor, who couldn't just then get at his pockets; and I added,
"to save time, I '11 chuck out the shillings and sovereigns, and then
we can make out the account, and you can settle with me after-
wards."
In a moment, Jupiter-like, I descended in a glittering shower on
the Danaes of the crowd. Never was popularity at such a height
as was the Future Musical Doctor's at that moment. And to think
that, afterwards, he disputed my acpount of it, and said I couldn't
have thrown away thirteen pound* ten like that. But he is a
noble ctvur. I make it a rule to speak well of a man till he pays
me. Then,—but no—Jamais—tirrurf, shall I say one word against
my dear old friend AniHtTi g. THIRTKEN-POUXDS-TEX, Mus. Doc.,
Cam.
We went over the backs of the Colleges, which are looking lovely
at this time of year. OLD Toy of Chriat Church (you recollect OLD
TOM !•), who is still the Porter at the Lodge, bless his grey hair, is
as gay and as lively as ever.
"lou remember me?" J said to the old boy.
He did, and replied quickly,
"And you '11 remember me, won't you, Sir?"
I turne'd with a moist eye to the Composer, and hummed " Then
You 'II Remember Me" (I34LFE), and I pointed out to him what was
the custom from time immemorial.
He gave him a note—from, his chest; my Composer never gives
less—and such a note!!
Well, Sir, we crossed Peckwater, and came out at the back of
Trinity Hall, by the Bridge of Sighs, near Joan of Arc's College,
where we saw many of its members—hence called Joanians. How
beautiful!! What an interlacement of foliage and architecture ! *
But I must come at once to the business of the day.
A Procession was formed in this order:—
One of the Pokers (the other came later), the Shovel, and other
University implements, signifying respectively the four terms of the
year, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. Then the Proctor, in
an ancient Roman chariot, attended by two Junior Proctors armed
with/rtscfs. These were hooted: Proctors always are. Then came
as fine a show of University bull-dogs, for which breed vou know

Ladies affiliated to the University, headed by the Margaret Pro-
fessor, the town band playing Marguerite's Jewel Song" from
Faust. All the caps and gowns were of Cambridge Blue, shining in
the sun, with fringed silver tassels. Then the leading Noblemen of
the University, in their splendid uniforms and armour of the reign
of HENBY. THE EIGHTH. Then came alone the Public Orator, carried
away by his own eloquence. Received with acclamations. After
him DR. Goss, playing on a beautiful organ drawn by three fawn-
coloured spinnets/T with two men as Tritons blowing. Then
came the Chancellor on horseback. The DUKE OF DEVONSHIRE,
carryipg a pot of the cream of his own native land as an offer-
ing. This is an old custom, but, as I whispered to the High
Steward, "It's an old custom, but it's all rite." He roared,
shouted, kicked, but he was obliged to get on, as the Univer-
sity Poker (red hot, of course), was behind him. The Mace
looked quite spicey. The Commissary, MR. FOESTTH, came next in
uniform. His office is to run on errands for the Heads of the
Colleges, and a tine berth it is, with a long vacation of four months
and a half. Then came, as stately as possible, the Sex Viri, faces
blacked, white hats with black bands, long-tailed coats, and
gigantic white chokers and collars. Then the various Professors,
each carrying his own tripos and a square bit of carpet. The
Auditors of the Chest, flashing their bright new stethescopcs, made
a fine show, and were much cheered. The two Moderators walked
together, with their wicks half turned up, and their abat-jours, or
* "Interlacement of foliage and architecture?" It seems to us to be a
muddle of names and places. Peckwater is in Christ Church, Oxford, and
"Old Tom "is the name, we had always understood, of a vulgarian drink much
in vogue at the lower order of taverns; while "Tom " at Oxford is certainly
not a man—more like, if w« may be allowed the harmless jest, a belli than a
bfau. As to Joan of Arc's College, we fancy that there must be some mis-
take here. Still we may be wrong, and -we admit that tempera miilantur, and
the Universities hare so changed their characters, that what was the pecu-
liarity of the one, may now have become part and parcel of the other. Yet,
on second thoughts, when our Correspondent appeals to us for corroboration,
and says " You recollect OLD TOM," we are bound to admit that we do not,
Yet, it he exists, and if lie recollect* us. what can be laid, except after a
personal investigation on the spot, which there is not now time to make. In
future, we must adopt a new and more stringent plan with Our liepresent*-
tive. We say this for the security of the Puplic.—'Eo.
t Surely pur Correspondent must mean "jennets." A spinnet vat an
ancient musical instrument. We print it as written, because, as he was on
the spot, the name might have been spinnets after all. JJut they never did
this sort of thing in our time.—ED.

shades, well spread out, as proud as peacocks. It is odd. yet a sign
of strong University Conservatism, that, though gas has been intro-
duced everywhere, these two ancient Moderators should be still
retained on the establishment. The celebrated PBOFESSOE LIGHT-
FOOT (Doctor of Dancing, as his name implies), was received with
acclamations. The Professor of Astronomy wore his stars, a new
cocked hat, and walked alonglooking at nothing particular through
a brand-new telescope. The Downing Professor of Medicine was got
up as DB. DULCAMARA, and attended by the conventional Jack-
pudding, with the usual big pill-box, drum, and old jokes, which
fell flat. The Botany Professor was distinguished by a sunflower in
his button-hole, over the Arabic by his Bedouin costume. Alto-
gether it was a grand. I may say, an exceptionally grand spectacle.
Then we came. When I say " we," I mean that I, of course, was
apparently a mere subsidiary — a mere super, while, as was right
and proper, all the attention was centred upon Le Jeune Com-
positeur, who, as pale as milk, but with a calm step and one un-
faltering eye (the other being on the other side, I cannot give you
any account of it, and I tcill not invent), marched onward, occa-
sionally turning to press my hand, to ask me how he was looking,
and to beg me not to forget to prompt him in the Latin reply which
he would have to make to the Public Orator, and which, though
he'd been iip all night learning it— (we were up together, and I was
hearing him. "We awoke in our chairs about four A.M., "Mi <r»5t
oiSi TVA.X»," as the great scholar POESON said, and as I feel /should
have said, had I only had the great scholar POBSON'S opportunity,
— tout est la), he was obliged to repeat over and over again, as he
walked along, with, I admit, a proud step and an erect bearing,
towering above all heads, the observed of all observers.
I attended him as the Minstrel's best man. White waistcoat with
Camelia in my button-hole, primrose gloves, but I refused to black
my face, positively. Behind us and winding up the procession-
but we couldn't see behind us, and I scorn to invent.
With a flourish of trumpets we entered the Senate House by the
sheldonian Gate, where we were received by all the great Dons of
Brasenose, whose privilege it is on these occasions to wear the brazen
jwignia of their college: the effect is striking, and is at first like a
•amily of golden-nose d Punches. The galleries were full; all seats
;aken; a first-rate house. No paper; all genuine; there were a
few foreign orders; and I gave a few orders myself, but it was
to the boys, in front, to get away from the railings. The military
bands played (outside) through the proceedings, so that, to put it
theatrically, we " spoke through music."
The Public Orator advanced. "By Jingo!" he exclaimed.
"Quid est?" I asked in a whisper.
"Perdidi orationem meam .'" he exclaimed.
"Quid faciesne?" says I. I haven't spoken Latin since I was
in Hungary, campaigning, and I own that I wasn't quite sure of my
ne and my "num." But when I was campaigning, and out al
night, my knee was »j<mi—as I said to the Regius Professor, who
told it to the Hulsean Professor, and they went off. behind the Vice
Chancellor, in suppressed shouts. My! or as we say here, "Meu m"
it was a scene.
"Da mihi verbum," says he to me.
"rolo," I replied.
"I say," whispered my dear friend the future Musical Doctor, "for
goodness sake don't gire him my speech."
"C'ompte stir moi.'" I returned, and creeping up inside the Public
Orator s enormous gown, I begged him to keep his arms down • then
I put out mine under his, and did the old trick. He spoke, I did the
action, occasionally giving him the word when he stuck. The effect
was admirable, and the encore was enormous and enthusiastic.
It was as much as I could do not to step from underneath the gown,
and bow my acknowledgments. However, I didn't wish dare
gqgam ad ventos. This is in brief the idea of the speech :—
Dommus Vice-Cancellarius, Alagistcr, Dominte et Domini,
Magistrte c-t Jfagietri"
He

whispered: and recklessly he plunged into it.
"JTabeo inagnam delectationem introducere ad restrain considera-
twnem maximum et cleverissimum Hominem Componcntem quern
preesens eevum ridit. yon solum composuit, ilk, hie maximus et
clevenssimus Vir Component, melodias musicales tales ut' Revidens,'

per quod, hie vir illustrissismus et valde doctissimiis descendet

put m, 'cum alio ckverissimo viro qui scripsit librettonem,")
Coxus et lioxus " (immense cheering and waving of handkerchiefs)
ex quo mine ego unam pan-am rent cantabo."
Cries of " No, No!" ''Don't!" "You've no voice!" "Cutit!"
&c., &c. In a whisper I prevailed on him not to waste his sweet-
ness on the galleries, but to gice it us afterwards in the Common
Room.
Then amid deafening cheers our Composer knelt down before the
\ ice Chancellor, and at his hands received the emblems of the
Doctor's Degree, an ancient Medicine Bottle (one of those big glass
Jungs with coloured fluid inside, and a hieroglyph outside—our an-
:estors. medievally, always took medicine in these quantities, and
"that's how they never got beyond the Middle Ages "—as I said to
the Medical Professor and Clinical Lecturer, who went into shrieks
and had to be led out by the Proctors), a plaster (adhesive on one side,
with the University Charter and the terms of his degree on the outer
side, away from the skin—this is only worn in full dress), and a
tuning-fork to be used at banquets. It is this last which distin-
guishes this degree, i.e., the Musical, from the ordinary Medical, or
Doctor's Degree.
Our Composer sang his reply, which was admirable. Words by-
veil, I won't mention names, but he 'a not fifty miles away from
Your Representative at this present minute. Music by the II
Dottore Maestro himself. I will just give you the chorus—emphasis
strong on the am in man, the vi very short, and eliding the vowels
when required :—

Sir, the whole Senatus'Consulti rose as one man. The hymnus
was taken up frantically, and a lot of Undergraduates were taken
-p frantically afterwards,—subsequent proceedings in the Town
all, at which his Worshipthe Mayor, &c., assisted.
I brought our new Mus. Doe. back again safely, muffin cap, gown
and all (which had to be returned by next train), and there only
emains my little account to settle, and this little account to be
jiven to a generous Public, by one who is ever most faithfully

THE ROBINSONS RETURN HOME FROM THE GREAT FANCY BALL AT THE MANSION HOUSE, IN COMPANY WITH A FRIENDLY RED
INDIAN OF THE PRAIRIES AND A WARM-HEARTED MEDIAEVAL EXECUTIONER, TO WHOM THEY HAVE OFFERED THE HOSPITALITY OF THEIR
SUBURBAN ROOF. UNFORTUNATELY, "TEAR'EM," A OIOANTIC, SHAGGY, ROUGH-COATED, BLACK-MUZZLED MONSTER OF THE NOW
FASHIONABLE ST. BERNARD BREED (WHO HAS BEEN LEFT IN THE HALL TO WATCH OVER THE HOUSE IN THEIB ABSENCE) DOES NOT
RECOGNISE HIS MASTER AND MISTRESS, AND ALTOGETHER FAILS TO UNDERSTAND THE SITUATION.
WHY THEY GO TO ASCOT.
Lady Upperten's reasons.—Because it is really quite the thing to
do. Because sweet ANGELINA will be sure to meet dear LORD EDWTN
there. Because a judicious lunch often leads to a good proposal.
Because the girls have set their hearts upon it, and have ordered
their dresses.
Captain Hook's reasons.—Because young PIGEON is going, and
will be sure to play ecarte afterwards. Because long odds are
always to be found if you know where to go to get them. Because
the Tailors dun a good deal before they leave Town for the Seaside,
and the country is consequently to be preferred now to London.
Because something good may be picked up, and no harm can pos-
sibly come of it.
Sub-Lieutenant Pigeon's reasons,—Because old ROOK has promised
to go. Because the luck at ecarte must turn if you only play long
enough. Because you like to see your money won for you by the
horses of your choice. Because it will be so jolly.
Mrs. Redpaynt FKrtington's reasons.—Because business of im-
portance will keep ME. R. FLTRTTNGTON in Town. Because she is
sure to be amused. Because the children at home are such a "bother.
Because in her new dress she will look six-and-thirty.
Mr. Tentofour's reason.—'Because there is nothing to read in the
papers, and nothing to do at the office.
Mrs. Tooting Smythe'g reason.—Because the CLAPHAM DE
BBOWNES are going, and it would never do to be cut out by those
odious creatures.
Mrs.. Clapham de Browne's reasons.—Because the TOOTING
SMYTHES are sure to be there, and it would be too absurd to be out-
shone by those vulgar persons!
Le Marquis Chateau de Pomme-Frite's reason.—Because he is a
thorough "gentlemans-ride're" and loves the " high-life " English.
Mr. Romeo Montague's reason.—Because she is to be there!
Miss Juliet Capukt's reason.—Because he said he was going!
Mr. Samuel Shoddy of New York's reason.—Becaxise he may as
well take Ascot on his way to St. Petersburg, via Paris, Vienna,
Malta, Rome, and Constantinople.
Mr. Capel Court's reason.—Because the Betting-Ring is getting
less dangerous than the Stock Exchange, and because a day's holi-
day in the country is worth a week's work in the City.
Mr. Punch's reasons.—Because Ascot is one of the prettiest sights
in the world. Because to the good all things are good. And lastly,
because if he likes to go, who shall dare to say him nay?
Mottoes for the Times.
For the Softas.—" Suaviter in modo, fur liter in re."
For Le Pallet.—" Est modus in rebus."
For the Coaching Club.—" A Four in the hand is worth two in

ECHOES FROM THE PARK-
ICKBJ) UP Hf JUUE, 1870.
WUAT an Habitue sayt,
Arm-chairs tuppem i, Sir;
all the others a penny.
What a ttuwager says,
V"es, 4ear ASTOIHETTE is
to be married to dearest
LOUD CIIAKLES in Au-
gust. And I can't help
thinking (you know how
very sharp mothers' eyes
are, dear LANV SHOCKS,
iiuw don't your1) that
(iwi.Mioi.iNi: ami the
DUKE Hut there—I
mustn't say anything
more—I positively must
not.
What a Member of
Parliament says. Well,
you must know that to
my intense surprise, Kir,
the Government actually
accepted my Amend-
ment! It was carried,
Sir; and, hy Jove, Sir, if it isn't thrown out in the Lords (which
it won't be), I don't know what we shall do. Give you my word,
Sir, I don't know what we shall do!
What a Young Lady says. Oh, isn't it a sweet dress? But I
can't say much tor the wearer. I hate straw-coloured hair and
washed-out blue eyes! Don't you, Major?
What, an American says. Yes, Sir, 1 have come to see your
Europe. I arrived yesterday, and did London last night. 1 'in off
for Paris to-morrow morning.
What an Elderly Maiden Lady say». Oh, yes, we girls are all
going to Ascot. My brother will take his daughters and myself.
We shall be such a merry party! You must meet us there!
What a Young (ientlemau from Aldershut says. I assure you,
old man, we are being bucketted all over the place. Nothing but
the precious Long Valley all the week! Never get up to town
before Friday night, and then have to be back again hy Monday
morning! Haven't had my hair cut for two days—give you my
word I haven't!
What a Traveller lays. Oh. I didn't do very much, I only
trotted through Africa, and had a look at Asia. Africa was rather
interesting; but Asia, you know, had been seen before. Think I
shall go to the North Pole in September, to get some fishing.
What an Owner of Horses says. I have it on the best authority
that the jock knew nothing about the plant, and was as much sur-
prised at the result as the public themselves. Dear me. what a
pity! If you had only come to me before the race, I could have told
you the whole story, and saved your money for you!
What a Very Young Man says. The Park's fallen off awfully—
not a bit like what it used to be in the days of my youth.
What a Very Old Man says. When I come here, my dears, it
quite takes me back to the days when I was courting your grand-
mother. Now, I remember fifty years ago. What i You are
quite right, my dears. I hare told you the story before!
What a Disagreeable Young Woman says. Yes, I have been to
the Academy, to both Operas, and to all the theatres.
What a Youth of Fourteen says. Now, Cn.viir.Er, let's make QVir
ponies race. Never mind the Peeler. If he joins us, his old screw
of a horse will be placed third. Now, then, off we go!
What ii Xurse says. Shall I take you to the Barracks, (Jears, to
have a look at the pretty Soldiers?

m the Park! Such amusing and interesting conversation, too!
Well, it can't be helped—we must go humu to lunch!
MORE PANICS.
THE Milliners and Modistes are in a state of panic, because while
this cold weather lasts they cannot sell their summer costumes.
A panic prevails among a number of Match-making Maiuiu:i-i,
who fear they will be left with their daughters on their hands,
through the dulnesg of the season.
ME. WILLIAM BIKES and several of his pals are experiencing a
panic, through a rumour which has reached them that Policemen on
night duty, instead of their noisy, heard-afar-off boots, will in future
wear goloshes.
A panic is beginning to set in among our Cooks, who fear the
jaduess of trade generally will reduce the price of Kitchenstuff.
Thrre are symptoms of a panic among Foreign Hotel-keepers, lest
MKSSIKUKS BKGWU, JONES, and ROBINSON, and many hundreds of
their countrymen, who have been hard hit by " Turks," should find
they really can't afford their usual tour next autumn.
Mu. JOUN THOMAS is in a dreadful state of panic, through a report
that some two thousand carriages have been given up this season,
and a doubt whether ere long he may be reduced to walk.
ADDRESS TO ANIMALS' FRIENDS.
THE work of Legislation asks the guidance of reflection.
Consider what you mean to interdict as " Vivisection,"
A cruelty to animals revolting to morality;
The cutting of a thing endowed with sentient vitality?
Firstly, what is a living thing, defined in sense contracted,
Within the meaning of the Bill proposed to be enacted?
Are fishes living things, trout, eels, cod, salmon, skate, John Dory?
Lie reptiles, frogs, toads, tadpoles too, in live things' category Y
DQ molluscs, and Annelidte^ with all Articulata?
Dr is your measure only to include the Vertebrata t
Must peetlea and cockchafers still continue unprotected,
E'en without a pain-assuaging ana-sthetie vivisected''
Next, what call you Vivisection? Simply cutting things with life
in 'em \
Don't you reckon lacerating full as bad as putting knife in 'em f
Is not shooting them for pastime Vivisection, and, in fact, is
Not hunting them to death an as objectionable practice P
Are crimping cod and skinning eels alive not on a parity
With any Vivisection fur the matter of barbarity '(
Live lobsters what of boiling, too, with purpose, for apology,
No better than experiments of use in physiology?
In a movement of pure sympathy with brutes against brutality
Not for a moment fancy we the slightest unreality!
But hear we not an outcry of a special indignation
'Gainst that mode of Vivisection which subserves investigation?
Twould seem there's an impulsive and emotional alliance
Amongst the men of sentiment against the men of science.
You talk of the atrocities committed by Professors.
Are Gun Club " Swells " less heinous, more excusable transgressors?
What of live bait impaled on hooks—old I / \ \ K WALTON'S habit?
Is it crueller to cut up a live guinea-pig or rabbit?
And do we owe a duty to our lobworm and our gentle,
Which we can only' violate by torts experimental?
'Gainst Vivisection legislate—but not without improvement
On the limited intention of a too specific movement.
Give all animals from cruelty all possible protection;
Don't merely try to hamper scientific Vivisection.

vengeance,

opinions by the angry fishermen. Attempted piracy.
4 P.M.—Busily engaged in extricating my boat from the weeds.
5 P.M.—Disaster caused by a rope coming from the towing-path.

A LITTLE LOGIC.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,
MEN say that we women are illogical creatures. Now listen
to me, there's a dear old thing, and I will prove to you that a girl
can draw an inference—I believe that is the phrase—which all you
male wiseacres seem to have missed. Everybody is grumbling about
the dulness of trade. The papers are full of it, and Papa makes it,
as usual, an excuse .for certain small parsimonies, in the matter of
milliners' bills, which spoil pleasure, and I 'm quite sure cannot
benefit business. But there is, says the Daily News, one exception
to this almost universal dulness, and that is the Artificial Flower
Trade.'!!
There now! Do you see the inevitable inference? I dare say
not. Men are quite obtuse as regards all the nicer processes of
reasoning. Does it not prove beyond question that, if men would
give up spending their time and money upon hideous Iron-clads.
horrid monster guns, Foreign Bonds, and Stocks, and things, all
which seem to involve tcickedness and waste, and go in for the culti-
vation of lovely and harmless trades like artificial flower making,
these periodical attacks of commercial doldrums would never attack
them at all? Papa adjectivises the milliners dreadfully, especially
after reading the " City Intelligence" in the morning. Now what
could be more illogical? Nothing! I have Iried to prove that to
Papa by a close-knit chain of reasoning which he pooTi-rxx>hs, but
cannot, or at least does not, refute. Perhaps if he sees it in Punch.
he will pay more attention to it. Here it is. The more well-dressed
girls there are, the more milliners will flourish; the more milliners
the more artificial flower makers; the more artificial flower makers,
the less dulness in trade. Q. E. D. (This means that Papa's argu-
ment is quite easily demolished! At least, my brother TOM tells
me_ that is the signification of those letters!) In fact, if all were
artificial flower makers (though that, of course, u-ould be inconve-
nient, for flowers are useless without bonnets to put them on), there
could be no dulness in trade at all!
There! If that is not logic, I should like to know what is! Even
TOM admits that; says it is a very choice specimen of the logical
process known as Reductio adabsurdum, or " rendering a little duck
ridiculous." I cannot quite see the appropriateness of the name
myself, but, after all, the proof's the thing. Please, dear Mr.
Punch, do print it. if only to show Papa that Superior Wisdom does
not pooh-pooh his little girl's logic.
And eternally oblige
Your devoted devourer, FLOEA.
OPEN BRIDGES OR OPEN SPACES?
No doubt the Tolls on those Bridges at which they are levied in a
great measure upon the working classes going to and from their
employment ought, by all means, as the Select Committee on the
London Bridges Tolls report, to be abolished. But will it be for the
public good also to abolisn the Tolls on suburban bridges, whereof
upon the Surrey side there are very few workmen, and whereat the
Tolls are taken chiefly from pedestrians and other excursionists
crossing them on their way to and from the bit of country yet
remaining on the Surrey side of them, still allowing the enjoy-
ment of pleasant and constitutional rambles, and got to by Putney
and Hammersmith Bridges in particular? These Bridges are
at present approaches to comparatively Open Spaces, which, if
all the Bridges' Tolls are abolished, will very soon be covered with
bricks-and-mortar, to the destruction of their utility to Londoners
at large, and to the benefit chiefly of the speculative Builder.
Would it not be a pity to go to the expense of taking the Tolls off
these Bridges? This, at any rate, is an Open Question.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON

A PERSONAGE IN St. PANCRIDGE.
ERT considerable alarm has no
doubt been created among the
more economical portion of the
Ratepayers of St. Pancras by
the following verdict of a
Coroner's Jury:—
"That the deceased died from
suffocation consequent upon want
of fresh air; and that it having
been elicited that the lying-in
ward had been left in charge of a
thoroughly incompetent person,
and was constantly so left, the
Jury recommend that the Guar-
dians should take immediate steps
to provide Miss PLAIT with pro-
perly qualified assistants."
According to the report
above quoted, the deceased
\Yus an infant a few days old.
Miss PLATT is the Midwife at
the St. Paucras Workhouse.
She deposed that she left the
ward in charge of one of the
Sauper helpers, "as the Guar-
inns allowed no qualified
assistant." When she came
back she WOT told the bAby Ttas dead, but found it not to be,
although dying. According to the fauper-helper's evidence, at
a quarter past nine, "the mother said the child was cold and
going black." Witness "took it to the fire for ten minutes, and
then thought that it was dead, and put it on a bed and covered
it up with a sheet. She did not call the Doctor as she thought the
child was dead." The Doctor stated the. cause of the child's death—
"asphyxia, from overlying." Hs said "it was the duty of the
pauper-helper left ift charge of the ward to send to him when she
tound the deceased dead or dying; and added that :—
"lie felt convinced that Miss FJ.ATT was considerably overworked, and
Miss FOLLBTT, the Lady Guardian, had tried to induce tho other Guardians
to provide a qualified assistant, but without effect."
The St. Pancras Ratepayers will probably not elect another Lady
Guardian. They cannot, however, be sure that clamour, consequent
on a Coroner's .fury's recommendation, will hot possibly drive the
colleagues of Miss FOLLKTT to go to the expense which that Lady
could not prevail upon them to intfur, and "provide a qualified
assistant." One point remains to be stated; the remarkable coinci-
dence of the unqualified assistant's name and nature. It sounds
like a hoax; but there the name is in the Daily jnewt of Monday
last week, and no mistake, recorded in unquestionable print. The
name of this truly typical specimen of a "Pauper-ITelper" is
actually SABAH GAMP. This is one of the St. Pancras "Pauper-
Helpers"—so called perhaps because they help paupers " over the
stile." No doubt there is at least another of them who, if not
named, might worthily be named ELIZABETH PKIO.
"BENEFITS FORGOT."
MB. PUNCH has received a number of communications on the
subject of "Benefits," but can only find space for the following :—
, PUNCH,
I HOPE you will excuse my troubling you with this letter.
The fact is, that! am in great trouble. I am an old Banker's Clerk,
and have been literallv before the public for nearly fifty years. My
income has been small, and my family large. I have the highest
testimonials as to ability and integrity. Sickness and other mis-
fortunes have, however, pulled me down, and it occurred to me
whether I conld not somehow or other take a ".benefit." Do you
think it could be managed? I don't understand these things. Can
you give me any advice or help?
Yours respectfully,

I AM a Professional Mnn<, and Mve struggled through the
best part of my life with many incumbrances, but nave managed to
keep mvself and family independent. Now, however, in consequence
of tne dulness of business and the overcrowding of my profession,
we are likely to be sold up unless I can get some temporary help.
My wife suggests my taking a "benefit';" but how, when, and
where? Of course, it would be distasteful to mv feelings, but it
would take a mighty load off mV mind if 1 could realise two or
three hundred. Do you think HER MAJESTY would lend me her
Theatrc? Yours, despondihgly,

DEAR PUNCH,
I SUJTOSK you don't know me? V>ry feW people do. I
have, however, made my living for manV a long year by wielding
the brush, and selling "pot-boilers." I have kept out of debt,
and preserved my position ns a Gentleman. Old age, and a glut
of the market have, however, brought ttie to a stand-still. I do
wish some one Would get me up a " benefit."
Ydttt-s, faithfully,

P.8. I thought of asking some of mr friends trt open an Exhibi-

wretchedly, I fear it would be "ho go."
DEAR OLD FELT.OW,
You remember my coming into my money five years ago,
don't you? Well, I 've tun through it, and spent most of it on
West-End Tradesmen. Oughtn't they to get me up a "benefit"': I
haven't a rap. Dropped my last " Fifty" on the Oaks,
Yours ever,

Mv DEAR Sin,
1 HAVE held a living of £150 a-year for forty years, and
reared a large family. My nenlth is bad, and I must employ a
Curate, and I know not where to turn for a little help, llo you not
think I might take a sort of ecclesiastical "benefit' at some well-
known church, and get a Bishop or two to perform fot me?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EBE Punch asked what is the Parliamentary
Privilege par excellence, he would say the
Privilege of every Member who has a turn for
Iff HI '~^\\ making himself ridiculous to try and induce
the House to follow his example. For latest
illustration, see the discussion on Privilege
raised by SIB W. FBASEB (Monday, June 12). all about a letter from
the Secretary of the Political Committee of the Reform Club, calling
ME. RITLEY over the coals for some too free and independent votes
of his, and threatening that, if he chose thus to throw over the
Party, the Party would bring the Party's big Club down, sharp,
• over nis knuckles.
This is scarcely the stuff for our Collective Wisdom' to waste its time on, even though it give the PBEMFER a peg for ten minutes of
solemn chaff, or lead up to a smart sparring-bout between the lively Londonderry Chicken and the phlegmatic Devonshire Pet—a heavy
weight, with whom the Chicken, however quick on his pins and sharp in his hitting, has, as yet, no chance.
To be sure the House was glad of any excuse for diversion, feeling that it had before it the dreary job of flo;
the Appellate Jurisdiction Bill, which not even the combined "persuaders" of DISRAELI, VEBNON HABCOTJBT, and
can galvanise into the ghost of a gallop.
The debate on the Second Reading of the University Bill was a little livelier, thanks to the hopeless antagonism of its friends and
foes. The Bill nominates Commissioners to readjust the nexus of cash payments between rich Colleges and a poor University, with a
view to see how far the transfusion of that life-blood of learning—as of most things—£ «. </., from the veins of the one to the other may
be carried, so as to strengthen the University without fatally depleting the Colleges.
MB. OSBOBNE MOBOAN wants to have the Commissioners hands more tightly tied by the Bill.
MB. CLIPFOBD— Fellow of New College—owning New College the greatest abuse of the University, and himself the greatest abuse of
New College—wants to have the Commissioners' hands made stronger for their work of reformation.
LOBD F. HEEVEY, on High Conservative considerations, would not have a penny transferred from the Colleges to the University.
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ROBEBT LOWE maintains that the sole good done by Oxford is the making a provision for those non-resident
youths, the only hard-working sons of Alma Mater, whom LOBD SALISBURY has christened "idle fellows," and that every farthing handed
over from the Colleges to the University, will be money perverted from the maintenance of industry to the support of laziness. The
University is nothing but a noun of multitude meaning the lot of Colleges whose funds are best employed as sinews of war for hard-headed
young men in their first battle of life. Hang research—look out for results—and when found, make a Fellow of. To endow research
would be, in most cases, to. find snug berths for some of the grossest humbugs of the age—to cumber the High with perambulators, and

mike "the Quads" unmusical with babes. Then who
and what were the Commissioners f REDESDALE, a block.
SELBORNE, a psalm-singing bigot. BTTRGON, a jocose
fanatic. MotiNTAGUE-BERNARD, a High-church Editor.
MAINE, an umbra of LORD SALISBURY'S. GROVE, a judge
with no time to spare. RIDLEY, a nobody—and as such,
no doubt, a model Commissioner. Altogether the RIGHT
HONOURABLE ROBERT presented what may be called, in
every sense, a LOWE view of the Commission, Research,
the University and its work. But LOWE withstanding,
the Bill was read a Second -Time with the understanding
that further ventilation of the irreconcileable views of
its foes and friends should be kept for-Second Reading
of the Cambridge Bill next week.
Tuesday (Lords}.—Their Lordships reassembled after
their Whitsun holiday, and threw themselves into their
work of Third Reading of Trades' Unions Amendment
and Salmon Fisheries Bills, with a cheerful alertness,
which showed how much their Whitsun rest has done to
repair the ravages of hard labour on their venerable
frames.
(Commons.)—First Morning Sitting of the Session, on
Poor Law Amendment. A clause to give Irish Paupers
English settlements by three years' residence, was all of
a sudden made general: another step—taken, Punch is
bound to say, without the least premeditation—in the
direction of an end that must be reached—the end of
Settlement.
MR. SERJEANT SiMON^-one would be tempted to dub
him Simple SIMON on this occasion—made an unadvised
attempt to prohibit all workhouse separation of husband
and wife. As it is, pauper couples ef more than sixty
are left together. This is as much as can fairly be asked,
supposing a reasonable latitude left to Guardians of
relaxing the rule where man or wife is between fifty and
sixty.
In the Evening Sitting, tke Report of the Royal Com-
mission on the (in) famous Fugitive Slave Circular was
laid on the table. Its recommendations amount to a
decent burial, under a proper salvo of circumlocutory
blank cartridge, of the stupid Circular, and a practical
restitution to our Naval Officers of the discretion which
should never have been interfered with.
LORD ELCHO moved Resolutions—;first, that Metro-
politan Municipal Reform deserves the attention of
Government; second, that such reform should be worked
through a single body. He travelled the old round;
showed up the confusion, inefficiency, and wastefulness
of our present higgledy-piggledy systems in drainage,
scavenging, street management, markets, paving, gas,
water, &c.; described how he would have the pale of the
Corporation enlarged to take in the four millions now
left to the untender mercies of more than thirty Vestries
and District Boards. SIR G. BOWTEH declared that, so
governed, the Capital would become a Country, its
council a Parliament, and its Lord Mayor the President
of a Republic, which might ultimately threaten the
existence of the Monarchy. The RIGHT HON. ROBERT
LOWE gave himself the great pleasure of running a-muck
among the Vestries. He painted a repulsive picture of
the British Vestryman, on a principle the reverse of
(IUEEN ELIZAJIETH'S, all shadows; and with the same
vivid vitriolic colours which he had used the night before
for the portraits of the Oxford Commission. MB. CROSS,
admitting that London needed better local government,,
criticised LORD ELCHO'S plan, but declined to commit
himself for the Government to that or any other scheme.
(Why not meet me, my dear MR. CROSS, and let you
and nie settle a plan for the government of the Metro-
polis between us'( I may tell you in confidence that I
have one cut and dried; and I feel sure, from the sound
sense you show on all matters you take in hand, that you
and I should understand one another. Mv plan embraces
all the good points of LORD ELCHO'S, and meets all your
criticisms. Verbum sap. I am always at home between
nine and twelve.)
LORD ELCHO, having served his purpose by his speech
and the discussion, withdrew his Resolutions.
LEWIS the Indefatigable made a desperate attempt to
pet more of his say than the SPEAKER would stand on the
further adjournment of the adjourned debate on the
Strangers' Exclusion Resolution. What unlucky out-
sider Eas been touching up MR. LEWIS on the rawr
Wednesday.—SIR WILFRID'S annual field-day. The
well-known old deer, "Permissive Prohibitory," was
turned out, started, and run down, after a gallant burst. Our ancient friend is
still fresh and game, though, perhaps, he hardly afforded the sport he has given
in former years. Parliament is still stubborn (by 299 to 81) in its determination
not to allow two-thirds of the householders of a place to shut the public-house
doors against the other third; not to make a rough division of the population
into those who never enter a bar, and those who can't enter one without making
beasts of themselves; and not to fling the country into an annual ferment, with
the beer-distributing interest all on one side.
We pity SIR WILFRID, who has to face his annual Parliamentary cold douche
hot from the Turkish bath of his Exeter Hall Meeting, packed with his friends,
and steaming with the fervid feverheat of their somewhat intemperate temper-
ance. But Russian constitutions, they say, can stand the transition from their
hot baths to the snow—and Sre WILFRID seems none the worse for the shock.
He always comes up smiling after his annual knock-down.
Thursday (Lords}.—A little talk about Turkey between LORD DELAWARR
and LORD D.BRBY. LORD DE-LA-PAIX should be the interpellator on that subject
just now, so peaceful does all look of a sudden, by the Bosphorus. The Dogs
of War have been checked—and pretty sharply—if not securely chained up yet.
(Commons.)—Second Reading of LORD SANDON'S Education Bill.
MR. MUNDELLA, who moved an Amendment, LORD F. CAVENDISH, DR. PLAT-
FAIR, and MR. DIXON, took up the cudgels for compulsion.
Mil. RIDLEY, MR. ONSLOW, MR. BIRLEY, MR. PELL, MR. A. MILLS, and MR.
WALTER thought the Bill went as far in taking the horse to the water as it
was safe to go. (Punch agrees with them. It won't do to strain even the
cords of love too tight.)
LORD ROBERT MoarrASir showed himself off in the characteristic attitude of
an opponent of the Bill and the Amendment both—abused School-Boards,
declared the Bill would interfere with labour, strike at religion, and, if it did
not " nil the butchers' shops with large blue flies," would tend to make England
for all reasons and in all respects a land not worth living in.
LORD ROBERT'S abuse of the Bill ought to secure its acceptance with rational
folks. The debate was adjourned till Monday; but the Bill will be carried,
and so it ought to be, for it seems a good Bill as far as it goes, and satisfies
those sensible people who are content to put up with half-loaves in this Wale
of Compromise.
Friday (Lords}.—Nonessential business.
(Commons.)—Heavy business. A Monster Petition, said to bear 102,000
signatures against any further Grants to the Royal Family was lugged in with
some difficulty by MESSRS. BURT and MACDONALD (only ex-working men could
have "hefted" the huge roll, and deposited it behind the table). If opinion
is to be weighed, such a petition ought to count heavily. Then came
Questions (Punch is glad to know we are not going to make a present of
Heligoland to Germany. If we gave it up to anybody, it would be to Denmark,
from whom we took it), and Sensation (MR. DISRAELI was unable to inform
MR. BRIGHT of the real motives for the wholesale murder of Ministers at
Constantinople.) Miscellaneous Friday-night talk finished the evening.

"In shaping laws, mere Logic should be dumb.
She rules not here; our rule 's the Rule of Thumb!
We play at dialectic, point and edge;
But Truth's straight thrust were—Breach of privilege!"
The Peri drooped, and dropped a woeful tear.
"' Abandon Reason all who enter here .""
Sighed she, "should be inscribed above this portal.
The Statesman's dread of Syllogism's mortal.
Farewell! Alas!" She said, and veiled her face,
And fled to—shall we say—" another place"?

A PARLIAMENT OF LONDON.
LOBD ELCHO has had his annual innings, and has assured the
House of Commons that it is much pleasanter to live in Paris, in
Manchester, even in Bradford, than in London. No donbt he' is
right, though in the minority: but what a pity he doesn't go and
live in Paris or Bradford, and leave us unhappy Londoners to pur
fate! The air of great cities does not suit small men. London is a
city of anomalies, but they are historical, and not to be removed in
a day. Its Mayors have been the friends of the Kings of England:
it is, in fact, an epitome of England.
Mr. Punch argues not against Reform, which is as fashionable as
Rinking and Cockle's Pills: but. as Eternal Member for B.C.—the
Eternal City—he takes leave to defend its institutions and officers.
There may be a more luminous intellectual centre, in Paris or Rome
or Berlin or New York, than No. 85, Fleet Street; if so, Mr. Punch
would like to know the address. There may also be a grander gateway
than Temple Bar, or a nobler obelisk than ALDERMAN WAITHMAN'B,
—but on these points Mr. Punch is not anxious for information.
Other Cities may perchance have wiser and more nowerfnl jour-
nals than the Times, but Mr. Punch is quite satisfied with that
periodical. And in its comments on LOBD ELCHO'S annual Motion,
he finds and approves this remark:—" Within the House of Com-
mons there is a vague feeling of apprehension that a Municipality
of London might attract some of the attention now paid to the pro-
ceedings of Parliament." It might, indeed, if recent occurrences
are any index. Did not the LOKD MAYOK, only the other day, say
that the Stage has taught us as much as, if not more than, the
Pulpit i* Such utterances never startle the calm arena of the House
of Commons. Did he not actually tell the Artists who ate turtle
with him" last week that " Genius ought to be in comfortable cir-
cumstances "? That demoralising declaration has already been
sufficiently exploded by all the philosophers of the Press. Genius
comfortable! What nextP Theologic hypocrisy and Stock Ex-
change theft make their own comfort; but Genius is a mere ont-at-
elbows, disreputable being, and positively ought not to be comfortable.
If Lord Mayors go about saying this sort of thing, it must be
obvious to the House of Commons that a Parliament of London
would never do. Such utterances are revolutionary. LORD MAYOR
COTTON became Member for the City on Conservative principles; but
what are we to say of a man who prefers SHAKSPKAKE to the Bench
of Bishops, and thinks that Genius deserves its rumpsteak and pint
of stout? No; if such are to be the Members of the possible
Parliament of London, LOBD ELCHO'S Motion was wisely resisted.

THE SCIENCE SHOW, SOUTH KENSINGTON.
WE now resume and conclude our extracts from the MS. notes
contained in a copy of the Catalogue found in the Exhibition of
Scientific Apparatus, and which, strange to say, still lies unclaimed.
The disconsolate owner can have it on application at the Office of
this Journal; but, that we may be satisfied he is the rightful claim-
ant, and endowed with the profound scientific knowledge which it
is clear the writer of the Notes must have possessed, it will be requi-
site that he should submit to an examination in two at least of the
following subjects treated of in the Catalogue:—Kinematics, Mole-
cular Physics, Biology, and Crystallography.
"Punching Instrument." Quite superfluous. There is too much
'' punching' going on already. (See the daily papers.)
'The Original Traversing Lifting Jack." Very delusive. Visitors
who come expecting to see JACK perform some extraordinary feat
of pedestrianism, or lift enormous weights without any apparent
effort, will be greatly disappointed. At least we saw nothing of the
kind even attempted.
"Mule for Spinning Cotton." Naturalists, Zoologists, and others,
should compare the Hydraulic Ram, the Steam Donkey Engine, the
Bulldog Clam, the Skeleton of a Rhombohedron, and, in MB. FBAKK
BUCKLAND'S interesting collection, the Telescope Fish.
"Skew Mitres." The attention of the Episcopal Bench is respect-
fully invited. The same competent authorities are also requested to
examine and report on the "Series of Temples (20 in number)."
"Three Models of an Eccentric Circle." There are so many eccen-
tric circles both at home and abroad, that without more precise in-
formation as to the particular circle here indicated, all conjecture on
the subject would be as impertinent as it would be idle.
"Lazy Tongs." Obviously the 'set is incomplete, wanting both
the lethargic poker and the listless shovel.
"Whirling Table." What Spiritualist sent it?
"The Original Copper-Zinc Couple." Almost as great an attrac-
tion as the Sirens. Believed to be unique. Beware of counterfeits.
This is the original copper-zinc couple. No other'is genuine. They

your error, if you mingle again with the outer world and go back to

A sunshade, ceuleur de

Cool was the blue of her

Cool her way to each gay

Tin• wrong thing for the Biennial backing;
And cooler the question he bad popped,
Since all in his case, save love, was lacking.
Cool was the clasp of their meeting hands,
Less cool the heart, her white hand's ruler;
But she was the woman to understand
Hot love will cool ere oool grow cooler.
Cool was the welcome given by Mamma

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
A. Why and a Wherefore—Notes—O» Memory—Diagnosis—
Medical Inquiry—Advice—Result.
OBSSRVATION, Preliminary.—For weeks and weeks past, now
running into months, I have been compelled to make my notes—
(for my progressing work, Typical Developments—getting on eioel-
lently—myself in full correspondence with MESSES. PoreooD AMI
GBOOLLY, about the binding, and the advisability of bringing it out
in parts)—with a pencil, on slips, in small books, on my wristband
—(Happy Thought in itself.—A small work on Society generally,
entitled Writings on a Wristband. Another Happy Thought.—
Copyright the title, and do it.)—and, failing a pencil, to trust my
memory. Memory I look upon as a last resource. (Note for a
Future Occasion.—" Considerations concerning Memory: a Blessing
or not? If a Blessing or not, why, in either case f" Think it out!)
I have b'uoi compelled to these shifts (don't like this word, but
"expedients" is too grand for the occasion; and Somebody's rule—
J9mr8OK's, I think, because it's BO characteristic of the man and
his style—" If ever use a long word when a short one will do as well,"
—is excellent. Must have some rules to go by.)—I have been put to
these shifts by the absence of my pens. For weeks they afl dis-
appeared; steel and quill, the heavy and the light-armed troops.
Not to be found anywhere. Tradesmen called. I replied, "With
pleasuire. Here is the cheque-'book; but there isn't a pen in the
house." Then the ink dried up, or rather it reduced itself to mere
mud. I found a stump of a quill with three slits in it, and tried a
short letter in answer to a dinner invitation. I might as well have
attempted writing with my thumb and oil paint. So I gave it up;
sent verbal messages by Commissionnaires; walked miles, back-
wards and forwards; of course I did not walk many miles '' back-
wards "; in order to write letters at my Club; dropped in on friends
who hadn't seen me for years, on purpose to ask them, "Would you
mind my writing a letter here? on their paper, with (generally)
their crests and addresses.
Happy Thought.—Also their stamps.
What an income may be saved by writing letters in other people's
rooms. Polite friend invariably says, "My man, or the servant,
will post it for you." Which appears to mean, "Don't trouble
yourself about the penny for a stamp." As a matter of courtesy it
is as well to keep a penny by you, just for the sake (entirely pro
forma, as it won t be accepted) of producing it and saying, laugh-
ingly (don't forget to laugh), " Here 's a penny for a stamp." Men
of the humblest means (only it's just as well not to try anything of
this sort on men of the humblest means) won't accept a penny for a
stamp. Therefore, unless you are vain enough to give it to a cross-
ing sweeper, because he has touched his hat to you, or to buy a box
of lights, you may keep that penny by you for months or years.
"It may be for years and it may be for ever;
Oh, why Bhouidat thou leave me?
I never will ' part.""
Happy Thought.—Ode to My Penny.
In the meantime, judging by the jerky character of my notes, and
their accumulation in note-books—on looking back, I fancy my
Memory must have had rather a hard time of it.
Result.—A dream—a fearful nightmare. It seemed to me (asleep)
that for hours I was trying to remember the point of a story which
I knew would set the table in a roar. There was the table feverishly
waiting for the point of my story. It was something about the
Spanish Ambassador, and somebody behind a door, laughing,—but
what at, and why, and who was the other person (the whole thing
depended on him, for I felt, in my dream, that I could have done
•without the Spanish Ambassador), T couldn't for the life of me
recollect. I struggled—I detained the audience, I implored them to
hear me out—I tried the story over and over again, but never got
beyond the Spanish Ambassador behind the door. As to what he
did, or what he would have done, or what the story had been before
it got into my dream, is still a puzzle to me. I have tried since to
account for it by " lobster «alad and a curious sandwich. For two
days that dream, or, rather, that story, bothered me. The one
question with me was, "Why did the Spanish Ambassador [get
behind the door r and what was he laughing at?"
Suddenly it occurred to me that this might be an incipient form
«tf well, to put it more pleasantly, I held a consultation with
myself, .and decided that the symptoms indicated "Over-taxed
mental power."
Sappy Thought.—Consult Professional Friend. Prepare one
sovereign and -a shilling, wrapped up in paper inside an envelope,
doubled np in my waistcoat pocket—easy to get at without fumbling
and blushing; and then practise, alone, putting it into the palm of
his (Professional Friend's) hand, or leaving it. as if it were something
I had forgotten in my hurry, on the corner of a table. Most difficult
thing to give Professional Friend a fee gracefully. One idea is (only
perhaps it is a trifle too much like a conjuring trick) to slip it under
my own hat on the table; then, on leaving, lift up my hat, and—
there it is. Only, to make things pleasant, one should begin this by
saving to the Professional Gentleman, " You see there s nothing
under this hat," and BO forth. One great point is to wrap it up in
as many little bits of paper as possible—also like the conjuring
trick, where the ring is found in the smallest box after opening
twenty at least.
The Interview,—Medical Attendant is puzzled. He asks me
what's the matter. I tell him about the Spanish Ambassador.
Medical Attendant meditates. I suggest that it indicates " Over-
tared brain." He nods. I am right. Over-taxed brain. And, ns
a remedy, I suggest, inquiringly, "I think I want a little change?"
I am rignt again. My diagnosis of my own case was perfect, and
only required this professional certificate—the guinea stamp, in
fact. "Change of scene, air. people, ideas P" I go on to suggest, as
though I were prescribing for him. In fact, before I leave I do
prescribe for him. I tell him what medicine 7 think best in certain
cases. I tell him that he appears to me to be overworked—that hv
wants change, that I advise him to go away and take a holiday,—
and, jocosely, "give his patients a chance." I don't think he likes
this last piece of humour. But, at this point the guinea comes
in—softens down the jest, g^lds the pill, so to speak, — and we
shake hands; the best of friends. It is evident we quite under-
stand one another.
On quitting, I feel as if I had taken my degree in medicine, and
it seems to me (with the exception of the guinea) that / have just
come away from seeing a patient, to whom I have been of the
greatest possible benefit. But I feel I must take a holiday. Go
away. Where? Perfect change? Constantinople? Too far—and
too hot. France? Germany? Herzegovina? No.
Happy Thought.—Ireland or Switzerland. Wanted, not only
change of scene, but change of manners and customs. The word
"customs" suggests the douane, and search at the frontier. This is
against Switzerland. But—four or five hours sea passage to Ire-
land.
Turn it over.

MEDICAL OFFICERS ASKING FOE MOEE.
By PHTLO BUMBLE.
THOSE vicious Medical Poor Law Officers are not content with
continually putting their employers to great expense by prescribing
superfluities for pauper patients; they are now trying to saddle us with
still more, by demanding relief for themselves. They beg for super-
annuation allowances on retirement after a long term ot continuous
service. The President of the Local Government Board, in reply to
a deputation of Medical Men who waited on him the other day with
that modest request, told them he " thought there were but few
instances" of such long terms. Well said. Poor Law Doctors, as a
rule, drop off early; for, as DR. WICKHAM BAKNES unnecessarily
remarked, they are "hardly worked and ill paid." Of course.
They must be so in the present state of the Medical labour-market.
Xor does anybody want to be told by DK. BABNES that—
"Their duties extended over many hours, and there was no certainty when
they could call any time their own. They felt it was but right that they
should look forward to a time when, if they survived their arduous labours,
they might look to retire; but after serving thirty or forty years they had to
resign, and then send in an application for an allowance. This was generally
refused by the Guardians, and the Medical Officers now only asked that the
refusal to grant an allowance of this character should come before the Govern-
ment Board."
In short, the Guardians generally refuse what in fact is a request
for out-door relief. Why, they think, can't superannuated Poor
Law Medical Officers come into the House?
In answer to MR. SCLATEK-BOOTH'S question if any case where
superannuation allowance after thirty or forty vears' service had
been refused was known, DR. BARNES cited the case of a DR.
WESTALL of the Cookham Union, who had served upwards of forty
years. A few other cases were adduced—among them that of a
"Medical Officer of Kingston-upon-Hull, who lost his health after
many years' service in combating an epidemic fever, and was left
without any compensation." Combats of this kind save the great
majority of Poor Law Medical Officers from ever wanting any super-
annuation allowance; and the House can accommodate their bereaved
survivors. Whatever Poor Law Guardians purchase for Poor Law
purposes, they are bound by the principle of parochial economy to
buy in the very cheapest possible market—particularly when buying
in the Medical labour-market. They will grant superannuation
allowances when the state of that market obliges them to, and not
till then. They will then also, and not till then, grant their Medical
Officers another request—that Union drugs shall be a charge on the
rates. And then the expense of drugs will be greatly increased.
Now, unless the Doctor finds it merely nominal, he is a fool. Any
medicine will do for paupers that is cheap and nasty, if only nasty
enough; otherwise, to be sure, they will complain. It is the Doctor s
own fault if Union physic costs him anything to speak of.
Some Guardians may fear lest a Medical Men's Union, like that of
the Amalgamated Engineers, may bv-and-by be formed to dictate
wages and other terms to Poor Law Unions. But the Medical Pro-
fession happily contains too many knobsticks for that. Competing
practitioners eagerly accept medical officerships at the lowest hire
in order to procure private practice. Ah, but that is the worst of
it! As ratepayers and respectable people, for ourselves and our
families, it may sometimes be disadvantageous, in case of dangerous
illness, to have no more skilful an attendant at hand than a gentle-
man whose services have been bought at the lowest price in the
Medical Labour Market. Parochial Economy exacts a personal
sacrifice when it obliges'us to let the Doctor who does for the paupers
do for us.
USE FOE THEM AT LAST.
WE trust the parties of Canadians and Iroquois Indians who are
here just now, will play one double match of "Lacrosse" before
they go, if only to prove that there is some use in double Lacrosse
Sticks.

on Monday, at the Uronfield Petty Sessions, for allowing a locomotiYe engine
to travel on the turnpike road without having provided a person to carry a red
flag 'not less than sixty yards before the said engine.' as required by law.
When MR. CRIPPLE, the fjuke's steward, who appenred as his Grace's repre-
sentative, heard the Magistrates' decision, he said,' Gentlemen, I bow to your
decision, but I am sure that the Duke will be very much dissatisfied.'"
Good Heavens! why did not MB. CRIPPLE say as much before?
Of course the Magistrates would have had a more becoming sense of
their situation than to have fined a Duke. Supposing the Duke
were not only to be dissatisfied, but vexed, or even angry! But we
forbear—such possibilities are too dreadful to contemplate.

the Government Vivisection Bill, in its present shape, become law,
to establish at Boulogne a School of Physiology, which, being within
convenient distance, will be easily accessible to British Medical Stu-
dents, desirous of obtaining instruction such as can only be acquired
under conditions of unfettered investigation; and whereat, also,
British Professors will enjoy legal facilities for practising the
experiments needful to enable them to prosecute Physiological
Researches on terms of equality with Continental men of Science,
and without being liable to be interfered with by a Policeman.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
~

ERY much obliged to MB. GORST (Commons, Monday,
June 19) for looking after the case of the Talisman,
whose Cap tain and Mate, after prolonged ill-treatment,
have been banished—Heaven save the mark!—by the
Peruvian Government. The Mate, like a sensible
man, is thankful, to use a mild term, to get out of
Peru on that, or any condition. The Captain, very
oddly, declines the favour of banishment; and now,
it seems, the Peruvian law, as it is called, will not
allow any severance of the cases. Both must stay
and be tortured, or go and be banished. We are glad to learn that even LORD DERBY'S
patience has been tired out at last—Patience takes longer tiring in my LORD DERBY'S snug
room at the Foreign Office than in the fetid cell of a Peruvian prison—and that he has
dispatched an ultimatum requesting what is called by courtesy the Peruvian Government to
give immediate orders for the Mate's release.
_ Adjourned debate on LORD SANDON'S Education Bill. Question lies between direct and
indirect compulsion. LORD SANDON takes our young asses to the water. MR. MUNDELLA and
ais friends would have him make them drink. ME. HABDY doubts the possibility of the feat,
or JOHN BULL'S willingness to put up with the attempt. Punch agrees with him. So does
the O'CONNOR DON, one of the Royal Commissioners. MB. KNOWLES, on the other hand,
also a Koyal Commissioner, maintains both the need and the practicability of direct compul-
sion. Even SIR JOHN LUBBOCK, however, declined to oppose Second Reading. So did MB.
rORSTER, while supporting MB. MUNDELLA'S Amendment. LORD SANDON replied on the
whole debate. His Bill steered clear of extremes, avoiding alike the secular Scylla and the
clerical Charybdis: and in time, he believed, would bring about what everybody wanted—
that not an English child should grow up without the rudiments of education. The House
agreed with LORD SANDON by 309 to 163, against MB. MTTNDELLA, and when SIR CHARLES
DUKE insisted on dividing against the Second Reading, by 356 to 78. Let friends of Education
remember that to them, too, applies the safe Italian proverb, " Chi ca piano, va sano."
Tuesday.—Vivisection in the Lords. Curious contradiction—Protection, by the Peers, of
Cat (and Dog): cutting up of the Cat by PETER TAYLOB in the Commons. LORD CABNABVON
showed his sound sense by the modifications he accepted in his Cruelty to Animals Bill; in
particular, LOBD CARDWELL'S extension of the object of the Bill to the advancement of
physiological knowledge. A cat and dog fight over the cat and dog clause. On the one side
it is to be extended to take in horses, asses, and mules; on the other, it is not to protect a
Ucensed person from carrying out experiments even on these favoured quadrupeds, where
|iecessary for the study of disease or the detection of crime. A new clause in this sense is
to be brought up.
In the Commons, on the Commons, in the morning. MB. CROSS holding his ground,
generally, against all Amendments calculated to tie the hands of the Commissioners. In the
evening, PETER TAYLOB'S fight with the
Cat. Common sense reserves the offensive
animal for extreme cases in the Navy.
Eight out of 30,000 men were flogged last
year, and only one of the eight on a Home
Station. The Cat is evidently dying of
decline. In the meantime, who slipped
this into our letter-basket; eh, SIB W. f—
Why a TAYLOK would fain kill the Cat appears
plain:
The ninth part of a man has some ground to
complain.
That the Cnt its nine lives and nine taila should
retain.
Wednesday. — Difficulty in getting a
quorum to listen to CAPTAIN NOLAN on an
Irish Election grievance (which, next night,
proved to be none, as usual), and to DB.
CAMERON, on an attempt to do away with
marriage by Church's banns in Scotland.
We had always thought the Scotch Marriage
Law already under ban of all thinking
people.and so did not anticipate opposition
to the Doctor's Bill; but, for a wonder, the
Scotch Members had not squared their
differences out of the House, so the Bill
was defeated by 166 to HI,—the Lord
Advocate maintaining that while the Scotch
Marriage Law needed mending on so many
more important points it was hardly worth
while tinkering this little hole in it.
Thursday. — MR. DISRAELI, applauding
the "safe forbearance,"—" he would even
say, the patriotic reserve,"—with which the
House has forborne from pressing Her
Majesty's Government for answers to the
Eastern Question, intimated, in answer to
MR. BRUCE, that he would be very much
obliged if the House would bridle its curio-
sity a little longer. All he could say just
now was, that the Great Powers had agreed
not to press the new Sultan. What well-
bred person or Parliament then should
press the Great Powers? Let all have
time to look about them, and consider how
they can turn the situation to the best
advantage. The Leader of Her Majesty's
Opposition—albeit, the mildest-mannered
man that ever paused for a reply—thinks
the time has come when it would be
"prudent, as well as politic, to make
further communication to the House."
"Communication " is one thing, "Infor-
mation" is another. For the one, LORD
EABTINOTON is free to press; for the other,
does he not wish he may get it, in the teeth
of the Master of submissive legions't Be-
sides, who knows if Ministers have any P
RYLANDS, shallowest of self-satisfied, and
nost self-satisfied of shallow men, moves
;hat it is inexpedient to transfer the
management of our Prisons from the Local
Authorities to the SECRETARY OF STATE.

Local Self-Gqvernment, a famous formula,
itands high in MR. RYLANDS' articles of
>elief. SIB MASSEY LOPEZ, on the other
land, went into elaborate calculations to

change, of more than £100,000 a-year;
vhile he showed that, since the Act of 1865,
local Authorities had very little control
>ver the prisons, and ratepayers none at all.
5o there would be no such blow struck at
Self-government as MR. RYLANDS seemed to
think.
MR. EVANS (advanced Liberal) was
leartily in favour of the Bill. SIR W.
JARTTELOT (staunch Conservative) as
leartily opposed to it. MR. DODSON, not
iking the Bill, recommended at least ad-
ouniment of the debate till after Quarter

MAN'S PLACE AT MIDSUMMER.
'NEATH golden sun and sapphire sky
Here ambient flowers and verdure glow,
To-day, where all, some months gone by,
Was cloud above, and, under, snow.
'Tis but by landmarks' aid I ken
That I am now where I was then.
"Where then you were you now are not"—
To first thought second thought replied,-
"More than a Tar is in one spot.
On the same deck though he abide,
Throughout his transit o'er the brine,
From freezing Pole to burning Line.
"The shrouded San, from Pisces' fold,
Frowned on another point in space.
Now fiery Cancer's claws infold
Apollo s broadly beaming face;
Our Earth has reached another clime:
So we move on in Space and Time."
Pleasures of Hope.
SITTING till you get the cramp amid the rushes on the
bank, in the hope of catching that bigperch which is seen
once in a twelvemonth somewhere in your neighbour-
hood.
Starting off with energy a sentence you have learnt as
a beginning to your speech, in the hope that it may help
you to think of something a propos to say in the middle,
and finally to reach a conclusion.
Accepting a bill drawn by a Jew money-lender, in the
hope he may forget it on the day of payment.
Hurrying out to dinner in the hope to be in time, and
finding all the guests assembled and glaring hungrily
upon you as you timidly approach them.
Diversion from Drink.
THE Sabbatarian section of the foes of personal free-
dom rave for an Act of Parliament to enforce " Sunday
Closing" on the community. Instead of a compulsory
measure for Sunday Closing they had better try to obtain
a permissive one for Sunday Opening—the opening of
Picture Galleries and Museums on Sunday. This Sunday
Opening, by attracting people from the public-houses,
would, leaving liberty intact, go far to answer all the
desirable purpose of Sunday closing.
of the probable saving in cost, and certain improvement in system that
the change would bring about; and finally the debate was adjourned,
on the motion of the LOBD MAYOR, till the week after next.
En attendant, the weight of the discussion thus far, as far as
Punch can estimate it, is heavily on the side of the Government
proposal. If the Bill is carried, we should be inclined to rank it as
about the best piece of work done this Session.
Friday (Lords).—Merchant Shipping Bill launched to a salvo of
doubts, hopes, fears, good' wishes. But look out, PLIMSOLL, or the
Lords may yet undo the good done in the Commons. Bill read a
Second Time.
(Commons.)—Morning Sitting enlivened by the little game of
Obstruction, played by the Irish Members, to keep the Irish Judi-
cature Bill out of Committee. ME. O'CONNOR POWEB—we need not
wish more power to him—divided on adjournment, 6 to 210, and
even after that said " No " to the Speaker, as bould as brass.
At the Evening Sitting CAPTAIN NOLAN delivered a carefully-
prepared lecture on the organisation of the British Army. Pity it
was not given at the United Service Institution. This was followed
by a discussion of Mobilisation, in which HOLMS and HAEDY, STAN-
LEY and BALFOITB, LORD ELCHO and HAVELOCK—all the military
talent of the House, egad!—took part. Quite a field-night!
ME. HARDY means to give the Mobilisation Scheme a fair trial,
and promises to let the country know the truth about its working.
He can't say fairer; and Punch has no doubt he will do as fairly as
he says.
PBOPOSED CHANGE OF NAME.

Edwin. Impossible! Look! Every seat entails a pitched battle.
Angelina. Well, we can sit here—on the grass. The toilettes
remind me of the Bois—three months ago! Well, now we have seen

GOOD NEWS FOR THE HORSES.
IS IT THE DffLNESS OF THE SEASON, OR CAN IT BE THAT WE ABE GETTING
SENSIBLE, AT LAST, THAT WE SEE so MUCH OF THIS SORT OF THING IN THE
PAKK? IP ONLY THEY WOULD DROP THE BEARING-REIN IN HARNESS, THE
HOUSES WOULD BE ALL RlGHT—BOTH HEADS AND TAILS.
ROUSED AT LAST!
URGED by the Deputation from the Meeting held at
Lambeth, the Authorities propose issuing the following
Memoranda for the public guidance in the event of a
recurrence of flooding by the Thames:—
1. When an extraordinary high tide is threatened all
male persons should tuck up their trousers. In the case
of females petticoats should not be worn long.
2. Carpets should be taken up: by the police, if neces-
sary.
3. During the continuance of the flood, anything like
<'n mi i may be dissipated by making an analysis of the
Thames water. Fishing from sitting-rooms will not be
forbidden. No extra water-rate will be charged.
4. The moment the water is seen coming out of the
chimneys it is time to leave the house.
5. Flat Irons, being liable to sink, should be conveyed
to a place of safety.
6. Drags in constant readiness. Office, Charing Cross.
7. Any person wanting compensation will be per-
mitted to want it.
8. In the event of anybody's Mother-in-law being
drowned, the Authorities will require to be recompensed.
9. Children in arms should be taught to swim.
10. The best method of accustoming oneself to the
effects of water could, no doubt, be ascertained from SIB
WILFRID LAWSON. Br ORDEEi
A Moral Converse.
ANOTHER American gentleman besides MB. WHTSLOW.
a MR. BREST, wanted by his country's Police for alleged
forgery, has had to be discharged from custody by the
Queen s Bench, on account of a legal disagreement on
the part of our Government with that of the United
States about the joint effect of the Extradition Treaty of
1842, and the Extradition Act of 1870. Replying to the
application f or his release, the ATTORNEY-GENERAL stated
in Court that:—
"The two Governments had been engaged in a correspondence
on the subject, and had not succeeded in coming to an agree-
ment."
The old proverb runs—" When rogues fall out, honest
men come by their own." It would seem that the con-
verse holds, and "when honest men disagree, rogues
come by other people's."
THE CRUSADE AGAINST CRUELTY.
DON'T suppose our Crusade will but check Vivisection
So-called. We propose to march on by degrees,
To the length of extending the shield of protection
Over all living things, down to mites, gnats, and fleas;
To guard them not merely from Med'cine's professors,
Or physiological students alone:
'Gainst your unscientific and common transgressors,
O'er all victims as well shall our tegis be thrown.
We 're determined to screen the live eel from the skinner;
Living cod we '11 from crimping secure by-and-by—
Though that process may make it the better for dinner;
And your lobster, before your cook boils it, shall die.
And your oyster shall be, in its native condition,
Consigned, at a gulp, to your epicure's maw,
Unscathed and unstung by the painful addition
Of pepper and vinegar—banished by law.
And the gates of a prison your butcher we '11 shut on,
If without ansBsthetics to yield them relief
He fit lamb for mint sauce, reduce, live sheep to mutton,
Turn calf into veal, or cut ox up for beef.
Under chloroform save when the patient reposes,
No farrier's blade shall prune cattle or kme;
Either ether shall lull pigs when rung through their noses,
Or laughing-gas make it but fun for the swine.
But, as for your sportsmen, there's no mitigation
Of pain which as plea for their acts will avail;
A live bait could scarce, by humane legislation,
Have an anodyne ointment applied to its tail.
We won't let the squires, sensibility blunting
By cruel amusements with rod, dog, and gun,
Go wantonly fishing and shooting and hunting
And mangling and maiming poor creatures for fun.
Against Vivisectors the victory winning,
By the facts we pervert, and the " crams" we allege,
The fissure we '11 widen from that small beginning
By use of our friend, the thin end of the wedge.
Sayings for the Marines.
ONCE a Lieutenant, always (at least for fifteen years) a Lieu-
tenant.
Patronage is the Mother of Merit.
Take care of the Subalterns, and the Field Officers will take care
of themselves.
Promotion has no laws.
'Tis. a long Military career (generally over twenty years' service)
which has no majority at the end of it.
A step in time often saves nine (husband, wife, and seven
children.)
A friend at Whitehall is worth two in Somerset House.
A Colourable Pretext.
"INDIGO.—This year the indigo imported wai valued at £1,545,473; last
year in the same pwiod, £1,375,439."
If therefore we hear from Correspondents at Glasgow and Dundee
that this year, in comparison with the year gone by, things are
looking more generally blue, it is not such a bad sign—for the
indigo-importers.

THE FOUNDER OF THE COMMISSIONAIRES.
"I do not know, CAPTAIN WALTER, how sufficient honour can be done to
you. With little aid you have quietly and unobtrusively opened a new page
for the soldier, and have given him a most honourable position in civil life."
LORD NAPIER OF MAGDALA.
A HAPPY thought that touched a generous mind
With strong; desire the old soldier's fate to alter:
Such the good work, sore needed, that we find
Adding a lustre to the name of WALTER.
Hence the Commissionnaires: a useful race.
Wo Metropolitans know all about them;
And, when we see some worn, true, fearless face,
Oi't wonder how the deuce we did without them.
They have fought and bled: and war's a noble trade
When nobly wag^ed beneath a hero's ken;
And, though we wish that war were never made,
Yet may we see by these that war makes men.
It made these veterans, to whose well-bred care
We trust to shield our ladies in their shopping,
Our letters, messages, nay cash, to bear,
Nor fear their fing'ring, dirtying, or dropping.
'Tis well that they whom battle's brunt and soil,
And discipline's hard test, prove worthy trust,
Should find retreats of honourable toil,
Nor in their evening lack a well-earned crust.
This their friend felt: Punch, for the public, thanks
One who before cold-shoulder did not falter;
And now promotes the Captain several ranks,—
Henceforth Commissionnaires' FIELD-MABSHAL WALTEB.
REASONS FOR NOT SUBSCRIBING TO THE HOSPITAL
SUNDAY FUND.
SQUIRS REDCOAT'S.—Because now all the Hospitals are given
over to the cruelties of Vivisection. Because no English gentleman,
of course, could think of subscribing to funds devoted to brutality to
animals. Because after the charges for this year's fishing, and the
keep of half-a-dozen horses (kept for fox-hunting, &c.) have been
paid, there will not be much margin left for charity.
Alderman Sir Benjamin Bumble's.—Because the Charities of
London are the pride of the country. Because it is beneath the
dignity of the Charities of the First City in the World to ask for
voluntary subscriptions.
Mr. Malthus Grind's.—Because the Hospitals are intended for
the poor, and Poverty ought not to be subsidised.
Mrs. Prim's.—Because some of the Hospitals may not be ortho-
dox. Because she feels a holy call upon the little she can spare to
supply the Savages of Central Africa with copies of Hymns Ancient
and Modern translated into their native languages.
Miss Peacock's.—Because bonnets and dresses cost so very much.
Because her allowance is so ridiculously insufficient, that she really
has no small change. Because if people are ill, they ought to go to
their own doctors, without bothering about Hospitals.
Mr. Bung's.—Because if '& man takes his lair share of liquor,
he should be able to keep his health without assistance from his
friends. Because paupers haye the Union Infirmary ready to hand.
Because the Hospitals do not increase the revenue.
Mr. Pump's.—Because there is not a single Hospital in London
conducted upon Temperance principles; and if people can't be
cured without the use of alcohol, they had better not be cured at all.
Mr. Sand's.—Because trade is really so very bad this year, that
the .Boys' autumn trip (during the Long) must be confined to
Europe. Because one of the Girls' horses went lame in the Row,
and another had to be purchased in its place. Because he's a
self-made man, and has no sympathy "with them as isn't."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL

AT THE OPERA.
PRODUCTION of "A'ida " at
Covent Garden. House
crammed and brilliant.
Temperature, ninety in
the draughtt. People
having determined to
arrive punctually, the
carriages at 8'30 are in
a line doicn to Leicester
Square. House, at first,
about a quarter full —-
no habitue, except the
real Opera-amateurs in
the gallery, liking to be
considered as excited on
any operatic subject
whatever, and the non-
habitues coming late in
the hope of being taken
for habitues, but lament-
ably failing in their
a ttempts to look as if they
knew where their stalls
were, and soon reduced
to ask the man at the
door.
The Overture commences.
Elderly Gentleman (who
has arrived early, and is
seated in stalls fourth from
'^e entrance, which he has
taken, "because," as he
says, "he can get out so
easily;" he finds that it is also a place where everybody can
come in easily, and consequently throughout the whole of the
short Overture, people are continually passing in, treading on
his toes with, or without, begging his pardon.) Dear me I what
a remarkable thing it is people can't he in time. (Tries to listen
to Overture. Soft music. Enter a party of four, including two
stout Ladies, over his toes. Old Gentleman growls. Then pre-
sently looks along the row, and smiles.) Ah! it's all full now,
thank goodness. (Begins again to try and pay some attention to the
Overture.)
Lady (enough for two ordinary Ladies. One of the party recently
passed in). My dear GEORGE (to her son, probably), I'm afraid we
haven't got our right stalls.
[GEORGE screws his head round and ' refers to numbers. Old
Gentleman groans. Shall HE pass out so as to leave the
way clear f No: for the four stalls between him and the
door are now filled. Overture continues. Fuss at the
stall entrance. Excited Gentleman with a party of three
gesticulating. Stall-keeper referring to numbers. Stall-
keeper telegraphs to parties in wrong stalls. They WON'T
see. Stall-keeper begs pardon and plunges recklessly in,
over old Gentleman's toes. More growls. Overture winding
up. The stout party of four are fetched out trying to ap-
pear indifferent, but stepping viciously on all the toes they
can, in their march past." Entry of victorious party,
over toes as before; restitution of rights to the lawful owners.
Growls of pain and dissatisfaction from the old Gentleman,
who wishes he had taken his stall right in the middle. Ap-
plause. End of short Overture.
Elderly Gentleman (to himself). There's the Overture over, and
I haven't heard a note of it. (Considers that this is at least twenty-
five per cent, of his money lost for ever. But there is a ray of com-
fort—the two stalls exactly in front are unoccupied, and he has a
magnificent view of the stage. He feels better.) Ah! a very fine
scene. Let me see, who are these people? Wonder what they 're
saying? (Refers to book.)
(N.B.—The mise-en-scene throughout is as splendid as anything
yet seen at Covent Garden.)
Enthusiastic Young Gentleman (here for this night only). By Jove!
Splendid! (This is later on, when the stage is fuu.)
Blast Friend (drawling). Te-er (he means "yes ") not bad. But
—ar—(slowly, and as if under a great mental strain), it's nothing to
what t wa" i* Cair'. (His Friend understands him to mean that it
it nothing here to what it was in Cairo "—where, you see, it was got
up by our dear friend the Khedive "regardless of "expense,"—so,
like him, bless him! "That's the way the money goes, and pop
goes" . . . everything that can be "popped.")
Near-sighted Lady (determined tofoUow every word in the book,
and looking up through her glasses every other second so as not to let
'emoutof her sight on the stage for an instant longer than is abso-
lutely necessary—reads to her hot and uninterested Husband from
English libretto). That's NICOLINI—he's saying—I mean he's
singing:—
"Round thy fair brow a diadem folding,
Thine were a throne next the «uu to stand."
Perspiring Husband (exhaustedly). Horribly hot idea. (A mur-
mur " Here '« PATTI ! ")
Elderly Gentleman in the fourth stall rubs his glasses, adjusts
them, and heartily congratulates himself on there being no
one in front of him.
Elderly Gentleman (to himself). Now then we shall see how
PATTI looks.
[Enter loungingly into the two vacant stalls in front of him two
very tall, broad-shouldered Swells. They take some time
in settling doom, having a good deal to do with their coat-
tails, gold-headed sticks, opera hats, programmes, tooth-
picks, books, and looking round the house generally. Great
applause announcing the entrance of PATH.
Elderly Gentleman (in despair, and vainly endeavouring to catch
a sight of PATTI between the shoulders of the two tall and restless
Swells}. I can't see PATTI. What a nuisance it is that (growls
louder). I wonder why people can't
Persons (about him wishing to catch every note). Hsh!—Hsh!
Elderly Gentleman begins to wish, more than ever, that he had
taken his seat in the centre, as he sees in front O/THAT seat
only a little boy in jackets. He wishes, too, that tall people
were not allowed in the stalls, or else that they should have
a row to themselves.
tHabitue (with glasses). Why the doqse has PATTI made herself so
hideous! She's more like a Ked Indian than an Egyptian. Why
couldn't she have got herself up like LUCCA, in L'Africaine f LUCCA
looked well.
Just and Generous Person (his Friend}. I suppose her'difficulty
was to avoid being like Selika, in L'Africaine. (They think over
it, while the Opera continues.)
Entrance of Royal Party. A Box full. Their Royal Highnesses
with the children in Sailor costumes. The Prince in the cha-
racter of the Royal Paterfamilias. Great excitement among
the Ladies, specially in the Boxes above, on the same side,
where they can't have any view at all of the Royal Box.
H. R. H. nods to the music, and keeps time with his book. The
children are much interested. Grand Spectacle. Enter " The
King of Egypt," name unknown, but alluded to in the book as
"one of the Pharaohs." Proposal made by the Sing to go to
Vulcan's Temple. Evidently one of the Pharaohs has been
reading " Lempriere." His attendants give him a golden stick
with a splendid golden Goose at the top. Grand Quintette,
PATTI, MLLB. GINDELE (the new Contralto), NICOLWI, CAPPONI,
and M. FErruofOER (the Pharaoh). Vociferous recall. They
return to bow. Difficulties arise, owing to "one of the
Pharaohs" not clearly seeing how to dispose of the confounded
Golden Goose, while he holds PATH'S hand on one side, and
GUTDELE'S on the other. Some one, "a Priest," or "a Mes-
senger," relieves him of it rather angrily, having perhaps been
sent on hurriedly by the Stage Manager for this purpose.
Exeunt Quintette.
AIDA sings charmingly an appeal to the " Merciful Gods," and
exit, applauded to the echo. Curtain descends.
Short-sighted Lady (who has been most carefully following the
book). Why the curtain oughtn't to come down now.' There's
another scene. (Her Husband, still perspiring, is puzzled, but says
he 'II go and ask the Stall-keeper. He departs, and does not return
for twenty minutes, with just the .slightest soupjon about him of
brandy and soda iced.)
Blase Friend (to his companion who is disappointed at the apparent
omission). They had 'nother scene at Cair'—Grand scene.
[Exit Blasg Friend.
Exeunt several knowing people, who think it '« the end of the Act.
Elderly Gentleman sees the two giants depart, and once more
has a clear view of the stage. He is well repaid. The curtain
rises for last scene of Act I., representing " The Temple of Vul-
can at Memphis," or the Egyptian Court at the Crystal Palace.
A religious service is going on in which the Ballet has a con-
siderable part.
Facetious Friend (to Interested Spectator). I suppose the Egyptian
Priest of the Temple used to advertise for Ladies of the Ballet,
Wanted for Vulcan's Temple: apply at the Vestry-door.
Facetious Person No. 2. Yes; the Vestry Virgins.
Grand spectacle. Noisy music. End of Act.
The Entr'acte is employed in the Refreshment Saloon. Timid
people art trying to find out how to pronounce "A'ida" and
GindeU." Bold people are calling it "Ida," and th» new

BY SPECIAL LICENCE.
Paterfamilias (impressively, to his Coachman). "JARVIS! You WILL HAVE TO
DRIVE us FIRST TO THE CHURCH, THEN BACK HERB TO THE WEDDING-BREAKFAST,
AND THEN YOU WILL TAKE MY DAUGHTER AND HER NEWLY-MARRIED HUSBAND
TO THE STATION AT LONDON BRIDGE; BO I PARTICULARLY WISH YOU TO KEEP
THOROUGHLY SOBER ALL DAY I"
Jams. "ALL RIGHT, SIR! BUT I SHOULD LIKE TO TAKE A DROP TOO MUCH
THIS EVSNISO, SIR!"
speaking of her as "Gin-dealer," and "Mile. Gin-gerbeer." People
who know all about everything, are setting everybody right, and giving
opinions generally. People who want to talk about it afterwards, and
nave no ideas of their own on the subject, are getting as near the known
musical critics, or musical celebrities, as possible, and picking up opinions
to be retailed with additions, subsequently, as their own original notions.
ACT II.—More spectacle. Grand scene. Apparently Hall in an Egyptian
Theatrical Agent's house with a set of melancholy people' waiting to be
engaged by some enterprising Manager, and a band of Nigger boys (who
"never perform out of a Hall in the Apartments of Amneris ' ") practising
for the coming pantomime.
Enlightened Audience encores the nigger dance madly. Opposition. Row.
Nigger dance repeated, while slaves condole with Mile. Amneris on the
bad taste of the British public, which prefers the " break-down" to the solo
she has just started and has been compelled to give up.
Habitue (much distressed). It really M a pity that PATTI has made herself
such a red-briek-dust fright.
Facetious Party 2fo. 1. Yes! look here! (points to book.) See what Amneris is
saying about her (reads).
"Amneris (fixedly looking toward* A'ida. Aside). Yon deadly pallor—her bosom
panting."
She's panting hard enough, but I '11 be hanged if she could show any deadly
pallor, unless some one would kindly empty a flour-bag over her. However, her
singing is admirable.
Act continues. More magnificencet and at the end of the scene there is a great
recall, tvhen, instead of taking it all to herself, PATTI goes off, and returns,
leading on MI.LE. GINDELE, whose hand she warmly shakes. Tremendous
enthusiasm, evoked by this graceful act, and on we go to Scene III.
More magnificence. Priests 'and Vestry Virgins in
full force. Then comes the already celebrated March
(which is certain to be popular), played by an
Egyptian Srass Sand ("time of the Pharaohs"),
with instruments of the nineteenth century. But
Habitues are accustomed to this in " Semiramide,"
and in "Norma," so it astonishes no one.' More
Golden Gccse, carried by talented "Supers,"
specially selected by the Management, on account of
their experience in keeping the "right side upper-
most," and in sight of the Audience, in whatever
direction they happen to be marching. But, for
an extra sixpence, tchcre so much has been spent,
the Birds might surely hai'e been done on both sides.
They only have one gizzard-wing, and no more; but
that, as carried, is effective.
Triumph of the Bold Egyptian Army. Entrance of
captives, apparently wives and other female relatives
of the conquered Ethiopians, who, we suppose,
must somehow hai'e got into the battle by mistake,
and so have been captured, while the Ethiopian
heroes ran away—which is just what the ancestors
of the Ethiopian Serenaders would have done—
at least from what we know of them by Massa
Bones, and "Massa Ginger, sare, who play de
tambourine."
Enter SIGNOH GRAZTANI as Amonasro, King of Ethiopia,
looking blacker than Othello or the above-men-
tioned Massa Bones.
Facetious Person No. 2 (struck by the fact of his
colour). I say, he's supposed to be Aida's father. He's
as black as my hat, and she's as red as a brick wall.
I say, this won't do, you know.
[Appeals to his Friend, who can't account for it
himself, but suggests writing to DABWIN on the
subject.
Magnificent finale. Brass everywhere, voices nowhere-
Then comes Act III., which is, as an Habiluf says, "a
gem." Charming duett between PATTI and NICOLCU.
Fine scene, musically and dramatically, between PATTI
and GEAZIANI. Late finish, but people stop to the end,
and the verdict generally is success.
From Opera to Theatre.—Les Danicneff, at the St.
James's, is well worth seeing. Important advice to late
diners-^on no account miss the first Act. The most
dramatic action of the play is in the first and third
Acts. The dialogue in the second is very good, and
admirably delivered. MADAME FAEGTTEIL is of course
consummate, but the part is by no means a strong one,
after the first Act. The dimciiltpart of Ossip is admir-
ably played by M. MASSET, and HELENE PETIT in Anna
is really, pathetic. We hope to return to Les Danicheff.
At the Criterion, The Great Divorce Case is very
amusing, and is capitally played all round. It has the
advantage of a good company of eccentric comedians,
numbering among them MR. RIGHTON (whose sleepy
old man is excellent), MR. CLARKE, and MR. CHARLES
WYNDHAM, whom the part fits like a glove. The Ladies
are all pretty, and Miss COVENEY is an admirable
Mother-in-law.—Avis Important. The play does not
begin until close on nine o_ clock, so that the dinner-hour
need not be materially disarranged, and a good laugh
(which is certain) is a first-rate digestive.
HAVING YOU BOTH WAYS.
'LA.UNCITED in the eclipse, with curses rigged,"-
If e'er craft braved the sea.
Or puffed along the stream of Thames,
A Steam-launch it must be.
Their steam distils the bitterest drops
In the Thames rower's cup;
And yet what good to run them down,
When they can blow you up?
And why should they your curses heed,
Or slack speed for your frown?
What good is it to blow them up,
When they can run you down?
