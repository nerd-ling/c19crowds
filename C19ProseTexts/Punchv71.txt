PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

I HAD been looking over KELLY'S last and greatest of Annuals, and had become absorbed in thought over that Business
Man's Bible. Tooley Street had been the last streit under my eye, and its famous Three Tailors the last thought in my
mind. Then—did I sleep and dream, or was I spirit-rapt a la SLADE, or levitated a la GUPPY? I know not, but there I
found myself by Golden Horn, instead of Thames, with the Three Talors of Tooley Street transfigured into the Nine Tailors
of Stamboul, in full Conference!
. The Nine Tailors looked pale and puzzled; every brow was dark with doubt and distrust. But at sight of PUNCH
they brightened.
"Land at last!" shouted IGNATIEFF, the hearliest and halest of the Nine.
"A Beacon, when our own BEACON'S FIELD is in utter darkness," exclaimed, with a sigh of relief, the young man from
Salisbury—the last taken on for the job.
"Une Ponche flamboyante! Ah qite nous en avons besoin—d'un flambeau!" whispered the cautious CHAUDORDY to
the serene DE BOURGOING.
"Wits und Blitzen J" (jaculated BARON WERTHER, as if he saw a way out of his Sorrows.
"Himmel und ScJion-vetter!" sighed COUNT ZICHY, the embarrassed but amiable mouthpiece of Austria, to BARON
DE CALICE, his chum.
"Benvenuto!" burst out BARBOLANI, with Italian brio, but musically as an Italian organ should, and does at
Stamboul, whatever it may in London.
Never did a gang of Tailors on an East-End Sweater's shop-board more joyfully hail the advent of a foaming pewter,
than this untuneful Nine of the Stamboul Conference-room the apparition of PUNCH.
"You have come," exclaimed IGNATIEFF, "to help us in cutting out"
"Anything but each other," I replied, significantly.
"Please, if you "d tell him you know he thinks of nothing but cabbage "querulously whined the Mis-Repre-
sentative of Great Britain.
The new hand from Salisbury shut him up with a grave but authoritative look of remonstrance.
"A truce to recriminations !" I cried. "We 've had a great deal too much of that sort of thing already. You Ve a
job in hand, my good fellowf, that might puzzle the sharpest set of diplomatic do.-Jgers that ever paraphed a protocol."
"You may well say that, man cher," growled IGNATIEFF, holding up a nondescript garment, to whoso "looped and
windowed raggedness" it would be vain to set-It for a parallel in the rags of Ireland as they used to be, or the tatters of Scarc-
crowdom as they are.
"The Ottoman Empire !" chorusscd the Nine, as I held to the light this unsavoury ruin, this rotten, moth-eaten,
and vermin-haunted garment, that had once been stout in stuff, bright of colour, rich with embroidery, and heavy

with gold lace. "And they expect its to make a job of it!" chorussed the Nine, each taking a tug in a different
direction at the rotten abomination, which I thought would have been rent to pieces in my hand.
"Cut it into lists, to nail up the shoots of the Panslavonian family-tree with "—shouted IGNATIEFF, who seemed to
take the lead among his Nine confreres.
"Ditto to you!" shouted the reticent old Prussian, who seemed to have no mind, or at least showed no hand,
of his own.
"There! You see his little game :—Divide and appropriate. Trust him with the mending of this poor dear
old coat!" groaned the unhappy ELLIOT.
"Which you 've been helping to botch, till it will botch no longer," interrupted the new haud from Salisbury,
turning on him sharply.
"If only you 'd respect its integrity!" groaned the sorely snubbed ELLIOTT, while the Austrian tailors whispered;
when suddenly a great noise was heard outside—cannons and trumpets, cheers, and acclamations
"What is it?" I asked IONATIEFF.
"Only MIDHAT blowing another bubble," remarked the Kussian, with perfect composure. "Bless you, we "re used to
it. They 've been at that game for the last forty years. The Gulhani bubble was quite as big as this, and they shouted
quite as loud over it. But what came of it and the dozen they 've blown since, but dissolution into empty air, after serving to
set Europe—with England at its head—agape, while the sharp Osrnanli swell-mob picked their pockets."
Just then, SAFVET, a Turkish tailor, popping his head in at the door, begged them to come out and look at MIDHAT'S
beautiful constitution. He was shortly and sharply dismissed with a flea in his ear.
"Don't you agree with me," resumed IGNATIEFF, " that the old coat is past patching, and that the best thing would be
to cut it up into little garments for the Young Turkeys I hope to hatch one day," and he winked.
"The best thing you can do," I said, "would be to chuck this filthy old rag into the dust-hole, with all the moths and
other vermin that have harboured in its foulness, and cut out another garment for Turkey of sound strong Government stuff
—the only one to wear well. But you must see that your measures are carefully taken, and above all, if you mean the coat
to fit, you must send your own foremen to see it tried on, and keep the old vermin out of the new garment."
Here a renewal of the row outside interrupted the applause that greeted my allocution. This time it was MIDHAT who
burst in on our deliberation.
"Who talks of a new coat, and of sending giaours of Frankish foremen to try it on? The old coat is quite good
enough for us, when we 've mended it, as we mean to do—arrange it afresh, in fact, from skirt to collar, on the latest French
pattern. Besides, after all, the more patches the better shelter"
"For the vermin," interrupted the young man from Salisbury, sternly; "not for the wearer. MIDHAT, mizzle!"
Thus roughly apostrophised, the Pasha first scowled, then squared, on which the young man from Salisbury, seizing
the scruff of his neck with one hand, twisted the other in the waistband of his voluminous nether garments, aud, before I could
interpose, MIDHAT was flying through the window towards the blue waters of the Golden Horn.
"The poor devil shan't drown, if I can help it!" I shouted, rushing to the window.
"He'll only pull you under," remonstrated IGNATIEFF; aud there'll be two drowned instead of one."
"Let me go !" I exclaimed. "Have I not my life-raft?" and, shaking him off, I flung up the window. A struggle, a
shout, a sheer-down dive, an irrepressible up-shoot to the surface, and I was floating on my own msubmergible bottom, and
holding up MIDHAT by the slack of his very loose inexpressibles. The Turk was saved, for rescuer and rescued together rode
the blue billows of tho Bosphorus on the buoyant pages of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

"ALL (WAX) WORK AND NO PLAY," &c.
THE annual pic-nic given by MESSRS. TUSSAITD to their company
came off as usual at Woybridge on the 19th ult. The Press may in-
form us that the company was made up of the employes of the Firm;
but Punch knows better. He sat for an hour the other day next to
Old COBBETT, who told him, between his pinches of snuff, all about it.
The tact is, that sitting or standing in the same position for a
year, night and day, and listening to the vapid ejaculation* of
country cousins and critical foreigners, has a deadening effect upon
the spirits even of waxworks: and a day in the country, once a
year, is not a day too much to freshen them up a little.
Three large vans conveyed the revellers, not to Weybridge, but
to Lcatherhead, and thence to Box Hill.
MR. COBBETT assured us that the party in his van got over their
usual stiffness very soon, and MRS. MANNING turned out a most
amiable companion, informing the party that she had begun life as
Miss EDGEWORTH, and had only taken the name and dress of MAN-
NING because ANNE BOLETN, who was going off, had parted with
her head rather than stay a year in the Chamber of Horrors.
A good deal of chaff (some said, bran) was dropped on the road,
and FIESCHI, who had chosen a creaking van, was a good deal
twitted about his infernal machine. MARAT declared it would have
been far better had they gone to Brighton for a. dip; but the CHIEF
JCSTICE hinting that he should have thought he had had enough of
his bath in the Chamber of Horrors, MARAT resented the remark
as personal, and was with difficulty smoothed down by his old
comrade, COUNT BE LOHGE.
The Claimant, who, during the ride, trod on everybody's corns, re-
membered well the day when he was DAHIEL LAMBERT. Now he had
more wax than ha'pence, and was looking forward to melting down
when his original, the unhappy nobleman," returns from Dartmoor.
The CniEp JUSTICE said he did not know that ABTHUB and the
Doctor were coming in the same van with him, or he should have
gone by a different conveyance, though it were in company with the
Ladies of HENRY THE EIGHTH'S Court. He had tried to persuade
MADAME DE SAINT AIIARANTHE to join them; but she persistently
refused t« wake, and he left her labouring under her usual difficulty
of breathing and general creakiness of the internal organs.
The employes of the Firm of TUSSAUD were much to be praised for
the skill with which they got their Pic-nickers out of the vans on
their return, and re-distributed them in their regular positions;
I though one or two of the Kings of England were inclined to be
'unsteady, and nothing would persuade MR. LISTON, in the costume
of Paul Pry, to stand erect on his feet. Except, however, for an
unwonted glassiness in their stare, and a slight derangement of
drapery here and there, the casual visitor to the exhibition on the
following day would not have suspected that any change had for a
brief moment disturbed the fixity of the stars who daily and nightly
shine in the Baker Street Bazaar.
THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE SOCIAL WORLD.
1. A Box of Figs, or a Pottle of Strawberries, with the biggest at
the bottom.
2. A Railway Guard or Porter who will decline to take a tip, on
the ground that all gratuities are rigidly forbidden by the bye-laws
of the Company.
3. An advertised Plain Cook, whose plainness prevents her having
any followers.
4. Your own Umbrella in its stand, after some good friend has
borrowed it.
5. A Keeper of a Lodging-house who, if you complain of ileas,
can refrain from a loud protest ttiat you must have brought them
with you.
6. A Costermonger or Cabman who, defiant of street-chaff, has
the pluck to wear an eye-glass or a pair of spectacles.
7. A Young Man ot the Period who never calls things "awful
bawe," or talks about "the Governor."
Sentiment v. Science.
THE Collective Wisdom, before passing the Vivisection Bill
as it came down from the Collective Sentiment, will perhaps assert
itself by attending to the Memorials of the Senate of the Uni-
versity of London, and of the General Medical Council, urging
"that the limitation of all experiments to registered places would
tend seriously to obstruct genuine scientific inquiry." A great
deal has been said lately on behalf of the " Endowment of Scientific
Research." Surely the majority of the representatives of a rational
people are not going to confirm without amending an enactment
which, imamended, will effect a hindrance of research in Physiology,
Medicine, and Surgery.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

V
OUK Eastern Questions were asked (Lords, Monday,
June 2C) than answered.
THE DUKE OF ARGYLL -wanted to know what the
Government knew about alleged wholesale massacres of
Christian village populations in Bulgaria, reported cir-
cumstantially in the Daily News.
LORD DEKBY believed it was merely that the Bashi-
Bazouks in Bulgaria had been exceeding the usual limits
of Bashi-Bazouk brutality till SIE HENRY ELLIOT had
had to remonstrate, that was all.
Then EARL DELAWARE wanted to know if the Govern-
ment knew anything about the intentions of Servia.
LORD DERBY, with some acerbity, declined to answer
for Serb intentions. The Serb Government has called
out all its forces, regular, militia, and reserves. But arming did not necessarily mean fighting.
Then, after an Educational divertissement, in which a pas de quatre was 'executed, on the theme of English Endowed Schools and
Irish National School Teachers, to a languid House evidently thinking of other and more exciting matters, by EAEL FOHTESCUE, BISHOP
TEMPLE, VISCOUNT GOUGH, and the DUKB OF RICHMOND, their Lordships hurried back to the Eastern Question. The questioning by
both amateur and professional diplomatists (LORD STRATHEDEIT AND CAMPBELL, LORD HAMMOND, and LORD NAPIER AND ETTRICK), was a
good deal fuller than the answering by the EARL OF DERBY, but with more of the Turk about it than was pleasant.
The Foreign Office motto is " The least said soonest mended," and LORD GRANVILLE, for Her Majesty's Opposition, cannot, it would
seem, suggest any better thus far.
But LORD DERBY did condescend to indicate our general line ot action—we would gladly reconcile, if we could, the Porte and its
insurgent provinces._ But we have no right to take part in an internal quarrel. Even that rule, however, is not one to be laid
down as absolutely binding under all circumstances. We have been and are in communication with other Powers and the Porte with a
view to offer such counsel as seems to us usfeul; and we don't mean to back Moslem against Christian.
Altogether, LORD DERBY is playing the cautious and non-committal game. JOHN BULL does not, as yet, see what other game is to be played.
Meanwhile, he is happy in knowing that BRITANNIA'S ducklings have taken the water—their native element on which they may
be trusted, he thinks, to give a good account of themselves, and anything afloat they may come in contact with. (See Mr. Punch s
Cartoon.) So he puts his trust in Providence, and looks to ADMIRAL DHUMMOND to keep his powder dry—should the worst come to the
worst, and the Servian dogs of war slip their couples, or drag their Ruski pimievr after them, collars and all. But he is unwilling
to face that contingency till it is forced on him; and he wotihl like to know something, if the Government can tell him.
(Commons.)—After a good deal of questioning and answering (including the Eastern Question of the day, put by MR. FOESTER, to

•which MR. DISRAELI answered much to the same effect as LORD DERBY
'' in another place "), CAPTAIN Pra chose the very inopportune moment
of the strongest muster of English iron-clads the world has ever seen
in Besika Bay, to haul our Navy and Naval Administration over the
coals. If the fire of our Fleet be not destined to damage the enemy
more than CAPTAIN PIM'S fire damaged our Fleet, Heaven help us,
and our iron-clads, turrets, and monster guns. It hardly needed
the ramming power of REED, WARD HUNT, and GOSCHEN combined
—to say nothing of plucky young LOED C. BERESFORD, R.N., in-
telligent amateur-sailor BRASSET, and smart official A. EGERTON—
to sink poor CAPTAIN PIM'S very clumsy craft, even when hacked by
the Big Ben galliot, always ready to exchange broadsides, double-
shotted, with the Admiralty and its ships.
On Naval Estimates RYLANDS the Rasper distinguished him-
self, in his peculiar style, by a proposal to reduce the Dockyard
vote by £'250,000. "The practical man of business " came out strong
on the occasion against all deferred payment in the shape of pension
—the one thing that secures steady and well-conducted labour to
onr Dockyards. It is satisfactory to find that The Rasper did not
obtain a single backer. Even Big BEN was ashamed of him, and
declined the game of "follow my leader."
In the Poor Law Amendment discussion, which followed Naval
Estimates, MR. WALTER (speaking on SERGEANT SIMON'S Amend-
ment allowing man and wife above fifty-five to live together in the
Workhouse) informed the House that, from inquiries at two large
Metropolitan Unions, he had found that not only had the house
authorities never had an application from two old people to live
together, but they had often had expressions of satisfaction from suoh
couples that they were allowed to live separate! (" The wretch !>;
was Judy's exclamation over this very ungallant anecdote.)
Tuesday.—-In the Lords, Yivisection Bill passed Third Reading,
with the thanks of LORD SHAFTESBURY, who had accepted, with mucn
reluctance, the words permitting Vivisection " for the promotion of
physiological knowledge." May his kindly Lordship never have to
call in the aid of Vivisection of the gullet from the effects of swal-
lowing a camel.
LORD DELAWARE, asked a great many more questions than it it
likely Government would find it, or think it, expedient to answer,
about the armament of Malta. Probably, LORD DELAWARE will see
the advisability of his satisfying his patriotic curiosity on such a
matter at such a moment by private inquiry at the proper sources.
The Government having suggested Amalgamation of the Royal
Irish Academy and the Royal TJublin Society, LORD O'HAGAN pro-
tested against any such coupling of cart-horse and thoroughbred,
and still more against obliging the Irish Academy, which has
hitherto spent its own poor little grant much to its own satisfac-
tion, to disburse it, henceforth, via South Kensington.
(Cvmmoni.)—A vehement protest against the Scotch Poor Law
Amendment Bill, which proposes to enlarge the powers of the Board
of Supervision, at the expense of those of the Local Authorities—and
may be none the worse for that, if Scotch Local Authorities are like
English. But there is, and ought to be (according to MR. GRANT
DUFF), a very strong feeling against the Bill among Scotch borough
Members. The Lord Advocate, Srn G. MONTGOMERY and MB. ORR
EWING, are as strong in its favour. It is a very pretty quarrel as
it stands. All Scotch quarrels in the House are, and should no
more be interfered with by outsiders than rows between man and
wife. The debate was adjourned.
MR. RICHABD, more power to him, made a high-toned, and of course
Quixotic, appeal to the House, on the subject of our relations with
China, and the opium trade in particular.
What an odd element a Quaker Member contributes to Parliament
will be apparent from one quotation out of MR. RICHARD'S speech,
in which he avowed his belief that " a righteous God ruled on the
earth, and that if we persisted in the course we had hitherto pursued
towards China, outraging the great principles of truth, justice, and
humanity, in spite or our enormous resources and our might by sea
and land, we should be crushed like an egg-shell against a granite
rock." Happy the nation, a fraction of whose Collective Wisdom
can find a hearing for such a denunciation of the national conduct!
MR. BOURKE for the Government admitted that our treaties with
China would be the better for revision. We were in communication
with the other Treaty Powers on the subject. As to Opium, it was a
very objectionable source of revenue. "Olet" might be admitted.
But how else was £8,000,000 to be raised in India? The Chinese,
he believed, objected to the importation of Missionaries even more
than of Opium.
Wednesday.—A gallant fight over the Second Reading of MR.
POTTER'S Bill for dispensing of intestates' real estate in the same
way as their personal. Fancy a Potter trying to get even the thin
end of the wedge into our venerable system of Feudal Land-owning!
No wonder BEHESFORD HOPE should shriek, GOLDNEY growl, and
HENLEY hum and ha! They assail the Bill as one for the extinc-
tion of the small landholder. But has the venerable system saved
him? We thought he was being improved off the earth pretty fast,
jy force of circumstances, Feudal Land-holding law to the contrary
notwithstanding. SIR W. HARCOURT reminded the House that there
was no magical distinction between land and personalty. If it was
ust that the law should distribute the one between all members of
;he family, it would be hard to show why it should not parcel out
;he other on the same principle. Perhaps. But the truth is that JOHN
iJr/LL does not feel the injustice of primogeniture, and does feel
that it tends to hold properties together, and to strengthen younger
sons by throwing them on their own resources. These advantages
n JOHN BULL'S eyes are too solid to be shaken by any injustice
here may be in making elder sons. Probably he doubts if there be
my. At all events, there is none that will reconcile him to MR.
POTTER'S thin end of the wedge: 210 to 175 was a less majority
,han Punch should have expected on the question.
Thursday (Lords).—The first Innocent massacred—poor Bank-
ruptcy Bill is no more. LORD DERBY, in answer to LORD GRANVILLE,
idmitted he had little hopes that War can be averted. This is
strong from BO cautious a mouth; and if MH. DIKRAELI was more
reticent, his utterances weigh less. All he could say (Commons), to
somfort the MABOTIS OP HARTLNQTON was, that the Servian troops
lad not moved.
Debate on ME. BUTT'S Bill for converting Irish landlords into
rent-chargers, begun by LAW—see the irony of Parliamentary
chances — ending in A. MOOKE — a very barren Moor too—with a
Division of 200 to 56. That Burr won't hold water.
Friday (Lords).—Intemperance temperately treated by the Bench
of Bishops, the PRIMATE for, and PETERBOROUGH against, the Per-
missive Bill. The latter had the courage to reassert his old con-
fession of faith: "If I must choose between freedom and sobriety,
give me freedom." SALISBUKY said ditto to PETERBOROUGH. Here
s the dilemma, whose horns are respectfully offered by their Lord-
ships to SIR WILFRID and his backers: "If intemperance be a
national vice, drastic legislation against it, being in the teeth of
public opinion, will provoke reaction. If public opinion be prepared
to accept drastic legislation, then such legislation is needless."
Their Lordships granted a Select Committee to inquire into habits
)f intemperance, and the manner in which "these have been affected
by recent legislation and other causes." Much good may it do them
and us.
(Common*.)—A spirited Debate on MR. BUTT'S Motion for a Select
Committee to inquire into the grounds of the demand for an Irish
Parliament. P. J. SMYTH tears the mask off Home Rule, and shows
Repeal of th» Union under it. Irish eloquence is familiar to the
House; but the "blend," of Irish eloquence with truth electrified
the House, and no wonder! SMYTH'S is the speech of the Session.
NOT COOKS ENOUGH.
REPORT of a Meeting held in the
"Demonstration Room" of the School
of Cookery, South Kensington, has
found its way to 85, Fleet Street.
Mr. Punch is unable to say by
whom it was sent or by whom it was
written. All he knows about the
matter is this—the proceedings were
jotted down on the backs of menu
cards, and that this novel sort of
"copy" carried into Mr. Punch's
sanctum a very pleasant odour of the
kitchen. Having said this, Mr.
Punch allows the Report to speak for
itself:—
MEETING OF THE SOCIETY FOR THE
PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO VEGE-
TABLES AND VIANDS.
A Meeting of this Society was held
at South Kensington shortly after the
annual gathering of the National
Training School for Cookery had
taken place. The room was crowded,
and many influential Vegetables and
Popular Dishes were present on the
platform. SIR LOIN DE ROAST BEEF
was unanimously voted to the Stove
as President of the Association.
The PKESLDKNT said that he was delighted to see so goodly a
company around him. It showed that there was a genuine interest
taken in the cause they all had so much at heart—the cause of good
Cookery. Good Cookery would benefit alike consumer and con-
sumed. The consumed in the hands of an efficient cook would
reveal qualities that would be utterly lost under less favourable cir-
cumstances. ("Hear, hear!") And as for the consumers, their

rery existence depended upon wholesome food properly prepared.
Nay, more—he might say that Art owed everything; to Cookery.
How many a noble poem had been suggested by a good dinner! how
many a great picture had been thought out in the pauses of a wisely-
selectedlireakfast! Digestion might be said to be the twin-sister
of Civilisation. (Cheers.) They doubtless all of them knew what
had occurred that day in that place. Her Royal Highness the
PRINCESS LOTJISE—(loud cheers)—had been present at the third
Annual Meeting of the National Training School for Cookery, and
he (the President) wished to say that that training school was well
worthy of Her Royal Highness's patronage. "' Hear, hear .'")
The first year of its teaching had been connected with the name of
ME. BrcKMASTEE. (Enthusiastic cheering.) He was glad to hear
that applause, for MB. BUCKMASTEB deserved well of nis country.
He had carried Cookery into the homes of the poor far and near.
(Cheers.) He had come as a messenger of peace. At his will dirt
and poverty had disappeared. Like a good magician, he had waved
his cookery-book, and a miscellaneous mess of meat and vege-
tables had suddenly been turned into an excellent and substantial
dinner. (" Hear, hear ! ") They would be sorry to learn that the
National Training School for Cookery wanted funds, and was seeking
for Government support. He, for one, thought that both Rulers
and People should be generous. He spoke feelinglv, because he
knew that in bad hands even " the Roast Beef of Old England"
might degenerate into mere rags and bones. (Cheers.)
The POTATO wished to add his testimony. He came from Ireland,
and Ireland was a down-trodden country. (Interruption.) He
would be glad if any one present would tread upon the rind of his
coat.
The PRESIDENT ruled that the Honourable Vegetable was out of
order.
The POTATO said that same was true. He was very much out of
order until MB. BUCKMASTER taught people how to treat him. Now
he got into hot water as often as he pleased, without any fear for
the consequences. (Laughter.) He would take off his coat that
very moment were it not that MR. BTCKMASTER had told him he-
ought to be boiled with his jacket on. (Laughter.) Would they
come on? He was worth any dozen of them, and they knew it.
(Loud murmurs.)
MB. ONION (who seemed to be suffering from great emotion) was
pained to be present at such a scene. He knew MB. POTATO well—
they had often met in an Irish stew, and he must say that his friend
was a very pleasant neighbour. They got on famously together.
("Hear, hear.'")
THE PRESIDENT remarked that there was no Resolution before the
meeting.
Miss CHABLOTTE RUSSE (who was loudly cheered) said that she did
not know much about the homes of the poor. As a matter of fact,
she had never been in a poor man's house during the course of her
existence. However, noblesse oblige. She believed that the school
was a blessing both to rich and poor (especially to the latter), and
she consequently begged to move that the school is worthy of State
aid. ("Hear, hear!")
MB. PoT-AU-FEir asked permission to speak as a foreigner. He
was a Frenchman, but had relations in Scotland and Spain. Thanks
to MR. BrcKHASTEB, he had been naturalised in England. He felt
that he was becoming a favourite with the poor, and thus thought
he might represent them. He begged to second, on their behalf,
the Resolution proposed by his sweet and aristocratic neighbour.
The Resolution was then put to the meeting and carried unani-
mously.
MB. MTNT suggested that a deputation of the meeting should wait
upon the First Lord of the Treasury, to ask for his support. That
was a really good idea, and a great contrast to the feeble suggestions
to which he had listened, not without impatience, that evening.
MB. SAGE (who sat beside MB. ONION) angrily asked if they were
lambs, that they should be treated to MB. MINT'S sauce F (" Hear,
hear.'") The Cabinet were too busy to attend to any culinary
affairs other than their own. The Estimates required a great deal of
cookery, and nearly every Member had a hash of his own to look
after. A deputation would be of no earthly use. They would have
only to appear before the PREMIEB to be gobbled up at once. He
would propose that the only way to attract the attention of the
Government and the Public would be to petition their dear and
valued friend, Mr. Punch (long, hud, and wiMly enthusiastic
cheering), to take the matter up. If his (MB. SAGE'S) honoured con-
nection, the Sage of Fleet Street, would only help them, their
success would be certain. (Loud cheering.)
THE PBESIDENT undertook the task of sending a report of the
meeting to the proper quarter, and after the customary com-
plimentary vote of thanks, the proceedings were brought to a con-
clusion.
ESSENTIAL EDUCATION.—Teaching the young idea how to Cook.

MR. OLDFANGLE'S OPINIONS.
IB," said MR. OLDFANGLE, who
lives in a quaint old Eliza-
bethan house in .Wessex, adds
daily to his library, loves choice
books, and likes to dogmatise,
"I have some strong opinions.
One is in favour of quill pens.
I hate your steel abominations."
"Gold, Sir," modestly sug-
gested his hearer.
"Gold! Mammon—
"' Mammon, the least erected spirit
that fell
From heaven: for ev'n in heaven
his looks and thoughts
Were always downward bent,
admiring more
The riches of heaven's pavement,
trodden gold,
Than aught divine or holy.""
MR. OX.DFANGLE rolls out his
Miltonic quotations with magni-
sonant rotundity of speech.
"No, Sir," he proceeds. "No-
thing can equal the grey goose-
quill. You must cut it yourself,
with blade of keenest steel, and
suit it to what you are about to write. A canzonet to a lady requires
quite a different pen from a cartel to an enemy. How can the
unvarying steel or gold be adapted to the ever varying themes on
which letters have to be written? Cat a pen to write a letter to
your stockbroker, ordering him to sell Turks: would the same pen
do to write to a lady a pleasant nonsensical reminder of a Richmond
dinner? The thing is absurd. I am an old boy. Sir, but I would
not desecrate a letter to a friend or a lady by using the same pen
which I used for business, until its foul fringe were cut off from it."
"And you always seal your letters, MB. OLDFANGLE."
"Always, the seal is older than the signature. My crest and
motto are older than my name. There was Sans Dieu Kien upon
my coat of arms before ancestor of mine could do more than make
his mark. And consider this—when you seal a letter, the great re-
collection of your forefathers is brought before you in leisurely
fashion. Is what you have written worthy of the crest and motto
just fixed on the red wax? If not, for the honour of y9\ir ancestry,
tear up the epistle, and think again. Sealing-wax, Sir, is a great
check to epistolary rashness. I hate this hasty age of adhesive
envelopes and eteel pens."
"As to Turkey, Sir," said MR. OLDFANGLE, flying oft at a tangent,
as such ancient gentlemen will,'' I am tired of Mahomet. We have
tolerated the impostor too long. We have heard of Ireland for the
Irish, and the Seilly Islands for the Silly Islanders—but I say,
Christendom for the Christians, and the sooner the better. These
heathens should have been driven from Europe long ago."
MR. OLDFANGLE, having thus spoken, drank a glass of old port,
after looking long and lovingly at the beeswing.
ATTRACTION FOR ARMY SURGEONS.
(Wanted.)
TALKING of Vivisection, people are apt to forget what an amount
of it, operated by projectiles and other weapons of war, happens in
a battle to men as well as horses, and how much more has to be
performed on the former afterwards with surgical instruments.
Such vivisection as amputations and the like proceedings, necessi-
tated by lacerated wounds and shattered bones, is remedial, and
prevents greater pain by inflicting less. Therefore it requires
skilful operators; of whom, if a war broke out just now, there would
be a sad deficiency, according to the British Medical Journal, in
which—
"It is stated that such is the present state of the Army Medical Department,
owing to the growing deficiency of Medical Officers, that leave of absence in
several of the home districts nas been peremptorily stopped, and that at
Woolwich every Medical Officer has extra duties imposed upon him."
How much the reverse of pleasant is the present state of things
may be estimated from the fact that whilst there is a growing de-
ficiency of Army Surgeons, we hear of no falling off at all in the
supply of Medical Officers to Poor Law Unions, although their work
is laborious and their pay beggarly. If the service of the Nation is
so much less attractive to Medical Men than that of the Union, what
must the former be P

A DOUBLE DISAPPOINTMENT.
Stern Hostess (who is giving Private Theatricals). "You AK« VBBY LATE, UK. Frrz SMYTIIK. THEY 'VE BEOTJX LONB AGO!"
Languid Person of Importance (who abominates that particular form of Entertainment). "WHAT! You DON'T MEAN TO SAT THEY 'KB
AT IT STILL!"
A DAY IN THE KINTRA.
No appeal is needed to procure the enjoyment of a " Day in the
Country, at least for the fortunate children at present receiving; an
eleemosynary education in the various Sunday Schools at merry
Jedburgh. A pic-nio held annually affords them, more completely
perhaps than even Rosherville can the excursionist, "a happy day.
The next of these joyous gatherings, to include all the Sunday
Schools, was fixed, at a meeting of Sunday School Teachers, held
the other Monday evening in the Vestry at Blackfriars Church, for
the 12th of July. Arrangements mado for the proposed festivities
•will render the treat provided for the poor children a quite
uncommon one. The pic-nic is to be held in the Dovecote Park at
Hartrigge. whither, before starting, they are first to he regaled
with an address delivered in one ot the Churches. Then they, the
scholars of (1) the Free Church. (2) Blackfriars Church, (3) E. U.
Church, (4) Established Church, (5) High Street U. P. Church, will
march in that ordar of procession to the scene of revelry—the order
to be reversed on their return home, which will probably not be
deferred till morning. These points having been settled, then, says
the Jedburgh Advertiser:—
"The next point taken np was the proceedings at the field, and it ires first
rewired, after a lively discussion, that dancing be entirely prohibited, and
that the band plaj no dance-muiie."
The discussion which resulted in a determination of such remark-
able liveliness, must hava been "lively" indeed. Dancing and
dance-music haying been prohibited, with a view still more effectu-
ally to promote innocent mirth—
"The next suggestion wa« that no prizes b» given for racing, &c., the
gentleman who made the proposition alleging that the games had a demoral-
ising effect, and were just preparing the callant* for the tporU on the
Bunion."
Unfortunntely, the Jedburgh Advertiser does not enable Punch
to reward this particularly canny Scottish gentleman with the cele-
brity he deserves. But even that perfervid Soot was put-Scotted in
the fervour of purely virtuous and beneficent solicitude. The
wisdom and goodness—even the common sense of his proposal may
have had questioners; but—
"A good deal of discussion having taken place, this motion was nlao
carried. It was, moreover, insinuated that the presence of the lemonade and
soda-water stalls afforded cover for fugitive tippling in stronger liquor, and
consequently it was determined to banish them likewise."
No dancing. No dance-music even. No encouragement of racing1.
No refreshing drinks, lest they should afford coyer for the "fugitive"
—the Teachers of course meant surreptitious—tippling of " whusky."
Quite a climax in cutting ofi occasions of peccadillo—rather than
sin, as a chiel o' wrath might say. But the Jedburgh Sunday School
Teachers in council over a contemplated pic-nic have shown to what
a pinnacle of piety Scottish Calvinists can climb in prescribing the
restriction of pleasure. Perhaps they are capable of climbing higher
still. An improvement on banishing lemonade and soda-water from
the drinkables, would be the banishment from the eatables allowed
at the children's pic-nio of all luxuries more sumptuous than
"bannocks" and parritch." Moreover, to inspire the children
with thoughts and feelings befitting an occasion evidently designed
to be a solemn festival, the band interdicted from dance-mimic might
be further instructed to accompany the procession of the joyous
youngsters to and from their banquet with a funeral march. It
may be hoped that the existing regulations for their delight, how-
ever, will abundantly Bullion to impress their young hearts with a
sense of what a day they are having; and at its conclusion their
considerate entertainers will naturally lay their heads on their pil-
lows with the solace of an approving conscience—and aiblins a
nightcap of extra " toddy."

OUR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE CITY.
(He take* an Offlct, (ides cm 'Change, and offers his advice gratuitously.}'

Iw these dull yet most shaky times, when investors are shy,
and investments are still shyer, when most of the foreigners ought
to be put in their own foreign Stocks, it is indeed necessary for you,
Sir, who are the embodiment of Honesty (which is the hest policy,
after all).to send, in the interest—the ten per cent, interest—of the
Outside Public, a genuine, thorough-going, uncompromising, trust-
worthy business man (who shall be nameless at present) into the City,
for the benefit of all those whom Providence has blessed, not, indeed,
with affluence, but with a small certainty, which has to be turned
over and over again by its possessor, until it gathers that golden
moss which is denied to the rollingstone. Let Railway Shareholders
adopt the adage, and pause—" A Moiling Stock gathers no moss."
You know by this time—no one better—that I am above bribes.
You know, Sir, that even at school I had, at an early age, earned
the sobriquet of "Incorruptible TOMMT." t May I long live to
deserve the title I
I do not mention my whereabouts now, or the place would be
crowded by people coming to me for advice. Let the public find me
out—if they can. I am not the one to stoop to advertisement need-
lessly. Just over the door is a transparency representing Honesty
giving change for a sovereign, while Commerce deducts one per
cent, commission on the transaction. On one of the side-glasses of
a triangular gas-lamp is written, " Stock Exchange Business done
* We feel ourselves compelled to say that we never were more astonished
in the whole course of our editorial life than we were on receiving this letter
from the gentleman, who, we admit, up till now has executed certain com-
missions for us as representing our interests—or, rather, the interests of the
public—on various occasions. But we do not remember ever having authorised
him to go into business in the capacity of Our Representative. He has no sort
of authority from us—at leatt tee think not; though should he be able to slivw
us our own handwriting to this effect, we would cheerfully accept the respon-
libility up to a etrtain point. Till he so proves his case, we are bound, while
consenting to publish his letter, to place the public on its guard.—ED.
t Thii may hav« been so, but Our Corre»pond«nt was not—we think—a
•cboolfellow of ours, and therefore we cannot allow ourselves to be appealed to
in the matter of what his nickname might have been. If he i» the same boy

executed at the shortest notice and lowest prices. SAVINGS AND
DEPOSITS CABEFOTXY LOOKED AJTEB. WATCHMAN ON THE ]'l<FMisi-x
ALL NIGHT. Secrecy and Despatch. No business, no fee." On the
third, "Foreign Gentlemen attended at their own private residences.
Best price airen for old Stocks, and Money advanced on any sort of
Security, from Toothpicks upwards. Night Porter in attendance.
Best References required."
The extent of the business is, as you see, unlimited; and, besides
this, there are money-boxes all along the walls, to receive subscrip-
tions for every charity in or out of London. These cannot be opened
except with my master-key.
The Outside Public is saying, "How can we invest our money r"
"How can we get seven per cent, without risk P" The private and
moderate investor can come here, if he likes, and in our ante-
room (I 've got a partner in the business, but he doesn't appear
till I tell him) he can have a chop or a lobster, a bit of smoked
salmon and salad, with as good bread-and-butter as he could
get for miles round, only our boy will have to take the money
for the beer or spirits, the licence not yet having been granted'.
Your Representative can give him a first-rate cigar and an
easy-chair, and the client can give what he likes to the waiter,
or call for a bottle of champagne for the good of the house. Thus
business becomes a pleasure: and when I have concluded an advan-
tageous contract with a well-known West-End hnirdressing firm,
and secured the freehold of the leads outside for the formation of a
small aquarium and a Turkish bath, I do think that I shall be able
to offer my clients such facilities for doing business, as will be un-
equalled, lor some time to come, either in this, or in any other
metropolis of the habitable globe.
I propose issuing, weekly, a Bnllitin and a Bearitin for the
guidance of friends at a distance.
Latest Adi-ices (in my Weekly Bull-and-Bear-it-in).—The present
disturbed state of Turkey has had a marked effect on Wick's Patent
Candles, the shares in which are now quoted at 10 dis. instead of
25 prem. as a few days ago. The fall in Wick's Patent Candles
throws a considerable amount of light on the Oriental and Milhcall
Underground Tunnel Shares, which can now be bought at 12j. I
merely hint at this price, and shall be glad to do business. Of
course it is difficult to advise as to a certainty; but investors who
want to realise quickly, could do worse than put a few hundreds into
The Venetian Street Asphalte Tramway Co. The shares will be
brought out at 42; each share to be paid for at the time; and
should the Company not come out before April 1st, the money will
be returned to the subscribers after that date, bearing 5 per cent,
interest for its use. The coming over of the Lacrosse players from
the Dominion of Canada has sent Scotch Quanos (lira.) up to 5ft.
PHINCE BISMABCK'S sudden fit of sneezing (by private wire yester-
day afternoon) caused a severe fall in Little Pedlington Sidings
(down to 221), but the news that the Spanish Minister had ordered a
new hat and a pair of gloves, gave the markets generally a firmer
tone. Later in the day (from an authentic and private source) 1
learnt that on the hatter and glove-maker, respectively, presenting
their accounts at the Spanish Minister's house, they had been tola
by His Excellency's servant that His Excellency was not at home
at that moment, out would call and settle with them in the course of
the afternoon. Acting upon this, I operated; but when the news
was generally known, Consolidated Yorkshires had gone up to 135,
and as for Snoreham Oyster-Bed 12 per cent. Mortgage Loan (third
series), you couldn't get anything done under 140f. My clients
were thus able to realise enormously.
A client—whose name I will not give, bnt suffice it to say. that he
:s perhaps the most reverend, and very nearly the most exalted per-
sonage in the United Kingdom—came in to-day. "I made a few
thousands," says he, "last night at cribbage, with C L M o,
D—N ST-NL-T. and a few others. What shall I invest in?" "Your
Jrace," I replied, " go in for Staffas and Jonas." "What's that P"
le asked. Suspension Bridge Co.," I returned. "Suspension!"
ixclaimed my distinguished customer. "The Co." I explained,
"suspends a bridge—it never suspends payment." He smiled in
lis reverential manner. "What are they at P" he asked. "The
news from Moravia," I returned. "has sent Staffas down to 14; but
there '11 be intelligence from Zanzibar within three hours' time,
which '11 send 'em up to 190." "No!" says he. "Yes, your Grace!"
says I. "But," says the Archb-sh-p. utterly staggered, "how on
>arth can the Danubian Provinces or Xanxibar affect the Suspension
Bridge Tramway Co. between Staffa and lona P" (This, my deal
3ir, you see, is what we in the City have to contend with— i. e..
gnorance in the Outside Public: ignorance of cause and effect.)
Supposing," _I said to my Reverend client—explaining the whole
affair as succinctly and as clearly as possible —" supposing the
KMI-KUOK OF ZANZIBAR had a difficulty about taxation with his sub-
ects; well, the EKFEBOB appeals to the EMFKKOK OF RUSSIA, who
it once sends an armed intervention: the Zanzibaritei appeal to
Germany. KISM A KCK tends an armed intervention: the two inter-
ventions meet; they can't settle matters: they appeal to Holland.

SATISFACTORY!"
Mistress. "WEIX, JSSSIB, I 'M QOINQ INTO NAIP.NE, AND WILL SEE YOUR
MOTHER. CAN I GIVE HER ANY MESSAGB FROM YOU?"
Jessie (her first "place"), "Or, MKM, YB CAN JUST SAT I'M uxco WEEL
PLEASED wi' YE!!"
Holland, not being strong enough, appeals to Spain, who sends another armed
intervention to Zanzibar, via Belgium. Belgium protests; Spain protests;
Holland protests j BISMARCK protests; Russia protests; Zanzibar protests; and
all send armed interventions to Turkey." "Why Turkey?" asks my very
clerical but unbusiness-like friend. "Because, in every European difficulty
everyone sends an armed force to Turkey, which is the key of India." "But,
says my esteemed client, "Turkey isn't the key of Scotland, and how does all
this affect the shares in the Staffa and lona Suspension Bridge?" "Patience,
my respected client," says I. "Events march rapidly: what I take minutes
to tell, would not take seconds to be worked in the World of Commerce, of
which you, my very dear Sir—excuse me—appear to me to be lamentably igno-
rant. Well, to resume: the forces are at Constantinople: all the different
nations apply to ROTHSCHILD for loans to carry on a war. ROTHSCHILD comes
across to me, and says, 'Shall it be done? Will it pay?' In two minutes
we decide. 'Yes.' Immediately we issue a loan on condition of the United
European Powers taking shares in the Staffa and lona. Up go Staffas and
lonas. Staffas and lonas (stamped coupons) go all over the world. Russians,
Germans, French, Turks — all want to know what the security is, and then
comes the rush." "The rush!" says my friend: "where to?" "To Scot-
land," I answer. "Up go Northern Railways—Northern Railways are
always going up—it is their nature to. Thousands of people cross the new
Suspension Bridge of Staffa and lona—articles in the papers—shares up to
something fabulous—we all sell—all make fortunes; ROTHSCHILD retires, for
the two-hundredth time, with a fortune of 1,700,000, and from that time
forth Staffas and lonas can look after themselves." "Good!" says my
mitred friend; "but what becomes of Zanzibar?" I can't help smiling at
him, for, like all clerical speculators, he is a perfect baby in these matters
—" What'a Zanzibar to us, or we to Zanzibar, that we should weep for it?
Zanzi Bah!" "But," he exclaims, "Zanzibar began it: it was through
Zanzibar ""Reverendissime," savs I, "we could nave begun it just as
well at Temple Bar as at Zanzibar. T)on't you see, we, the real financiers,
got the whole tiling up. We (myself anj the Baron) didn't appear in it
personally; hut, your Grace, who, do you suppose, pulls the strings? Lor' bless
you! alicz done! get out!"
He was so impressed that, after a first-rate lunch, he sent out my clerk
to buy 30,000 Staffas and lonas, and wrote off to L—D C ~s to do the same.
[ pointed out to him that the stamp duty, the assigna-
;ion, the re-duplicating, and the fees at the Crown Office
:'or my clerk s swearing in person before the LORD
MAYOR, would amount to something considerable, not to
speak of brokerage, which (as I explained at length to
lim) was just 25 per cent, more on that particular day,
and at that particular time, than ordinarily. But he
was entete. So my revered client plunged for Staffas
and lonas. I regret to say that I have been obliged to
write since, and point out that, in consequence of news
;rom the North Pole, Staffas and lonas have gone down
x} next to nothing. He is not a bold man, and returned,
DV letter, that he would rather lose £17,000 than the
whole £30,000. So, expressing myself to the effect that
had he held on, and waited for therise,]\e would have
made hundreds of thousands, I sent him back £17,000,
minus £750 for the re-brokerage, for unswearing before
:he LORD MAYOR after office-hours, for unstamping at
Somerset House, &c., &c. So that he got out of it well;
and it wasn't such a very bad day's business for yours
:ruly, eh? Not much, of course, but still not had. Of
course I had to keep the transaction secret. At part-
ng he whispered, "Don't mention any little flutter
ike this when you 're calling on MRS. T. at L-mb-th.
Hope we shall see you for a week or so at our little
place in Kent." "Mum! " said I, with my finger to my
iips; and I let my archiepiscopal client out by the back
way in the absence of my boy, who had just run down
to the House to depreciate some Stock.
I just mention these little operations to show you
what I am doing, to inspire your readers with con-
fidence, and to place you ait courant with all the best
moves now on the tapis. A propos of " tapis," there's
SIR H—Y J—s just tappy-ing at my door. He has come
to ask'me about some foreign loans ; but I can't give him
more than five minutes, as I must go with a cart full
of specie to the Governor of the Bank. But look out
for further important news from

And hope they will illumine what they touch.

And folk who have to work may learn too much.
SIR ROBERT PEEL is making "lively speeches :"
We need not listen to his jokes, thank Heaven!
Alas, it is not yet the time for peaches;
But try fresh strawberries with cream of Devon.

Through what weirdnotes the wondrous bird can run!
Yet of all music woman's voice is rarest—

WHAT will MUDIE say to MR. SPUHGEON'S indignant
assertion that there are novels "he would not lie to
carry with a pair of tongs to the fire "? ME. DICK would
have asked, "Are there any novels _you would like to
carry with a pair of tongs to the fire?" Perhaps, how-
ever, MR. SPURGEON has a literary auto-da-fe' from time
to time at which this mode of feeding the fire is resorted
to. We recommend MESSRS. MUDIE to make him an
honorary subscriber to their Library if they would stop
the progress of the Index Ex-Spurgeon-atorius, which
seems to be already in course of compilation.

For hU part, he could not benefit by reading fiction. . . He would recommend

Who 'd have us gals shun marriage, 'cos it leads to 'omes like

And pass our leisure learning texts instead of reading novels!
A very pretty program, SUE! I 'd like t<> see him trying it:
To work like luggers, live like Nuns, looks nice, there's no deny-

Which texts is very proper things,—there's one or two I knows on

They 'd better bring a batch of Saints to fill sech sitivations.
And if Saints slaved like sarvant-gals, and hadn't no more larkses,
I guess they 'd find that SPURGEON'S plan 'ud squench their wital
sparkses.
Which what he rekkermends seems this,—what wonder gals finds
fault with it ?—
Let Servants live on cold biled weal, and never take no salt with it.
It 'a very true—give him his due !—he does come down a cropper
On Mississes as seems to hold continual nagging proper—
(Ah! i/he know'd, percise, what on the "rampage" or the "furrage"
meant !)—
And says a friendly word or two on giving gals "encouragement."
But silver medals, texts^ and sech, ain't all as Nature craves for,
Even among them Mississes as thinks we 're made their slaves for;
And Ministers theirselves ain't proof 'gainst matrimonial urgings—
I 've heard, SUE, of a MRS. S. and several youthful SPUBGIXGS—
While, if all Servants frowned on chaps as weren't right down
"relijus,"
Good gracious, SUE. the number of Old Maids 'ud be perdijus!
For novels—well, there's good and bad, as so there is of tracks too,
Which some I 've read does anythink but stick the sober facks to.
SPURGINS himself can spin a yarn, and pile it up like winking,
And Sermons, for " sensation," may beat Stories, to my thinking,
/likes a tale. If SPUHGING finds more fun and ease in joking,
Or telling traveller's tales at home, or mild Havannahs smoking,
(Which last I 've heard he 's partial to,) he's free to spend his leisure
In patronising, pious-like, his own pertikler pleasure.
He doesn't feel no sort of call—no, SUE, I '11 bet my head on it!—
To chuck away a choice cigar, and suck a text instead on it.
Let him remember gals is gals, and no more Cherrybimses
Than other folks; as most of us does have our fads and whimses.
If lives is dull, and work is hard, and Mississes is rileing,
We sometimes longs for more than '' text s " to cheer us in our tiling.
My gracious! There's SAM'S whistle, SUE. No blackbird couldn t
beat him;
He's round by the back garding gate: I '11 jest'slip down and meet
him—
I may have time for half a word. Oh, SUE, he's got sech whiskers!
Wonder how Swells would liko to do their courting so promiskus!
There! there! / hears! Young Artful, to pop on me in this
manner!
And so no more jest now, dear, from your loving ,.,

AT LORD'S.
What a Young Lady says.—I do so like cricket matches, they are
so pretty, and I am quite learned about them. But do tell me, why
are they running after that hall; and is it really necessary to put
three bits of stick near the bowlers with their bats? You didn't
know I knew so much about it, now, did you? Thank you so much.
I will take a little more champagne cup. No raised pie, thanks—I
have got some lobster salad. Oh, do smoke. I am awfully fond of
the smoke of a cigar in the open air! And now, you must tell me
all the news.
What a Dowager says.—I shall certainly keep mv umbrella up,
in spite of shutting out the view from a carriage-load behind me. I
really must think of myself in this hot weather a little!
n'hat a Young Man says.—Really too bad of that old woman to
put up an umbrella, eh? Can't he any good to her, don't you
know. Nonsense to think she wants to keep her complexion. Got
no complexion at all, don't you know? Hasn't had one, I should
think, for the last twenty years, eh, don't you know?
What an Old School-fellow says.—Hallo, my boy, why it's you!
Haven't seen you for twenty years! How fat you 've got! Why,
what used wo to call you? Oh, "Nosey," to be sure!
What Angelina says.—My dear EDWIN, you don't mean to say
you were ever called Nosey!" How you have deceived me!
What Edwin says.—Hang that fellow!
What a Good Buy says.—My dear father, this is a very painful
sight! It grieves me to see two-and-twenty young men spending
in recreation time that might be so usefully employed in study!
What a Had Soy says.—Look here, old man, let's give the
guv'nor the slip, and have some more grub!
What Everybody says.—Capital way to spend a summer's day
pleasantly.
And what the Umpire says (especially at 7 p.m.).—Over!
Is there such a Thing?
WE extract this from a country paper, in case such a rara avis is
to be caught, and will give the address when it in caught:—

S. AND B.
Or the Shindy at the Sign of" The Laurel." As narrated by a
very vulgar Bystander to a Fellow-Philistine.
oir know, my dear WIL-
1.IAM, that house at the
foot of the two-headec
Hill?
Well, a-passing it late
t'other night I droppec
in for a sweet little mill.
Leastways, when I call il
a mill, 1 should say thai
it ended in jaw.
And no doubt the P. R.
would pooh-pooh it as
nothing but lingo anc
law.
It isn't a Pub I much pa-
tronise. Rather too up-
pish for me.
The landlord's a chap called
A. POLLEK —the poet's.
peculiar L. V.
It s a sort of a Swell House-
of-Call for your Bards,
Critics, Artists, and
such—
The noisest parties I know when they've once had a little too
much.
They give theirselves uppercrust airs, and look down upon pewter
and beer:
A stuff they call Nectar 'a their "tap;" never tried it myself, BILL
no fear!
But judging by what I have seen of the fruits of the liquor, I think
A chap doesn't lose very much who eschews that particular drink.
It appears that a couple of parties, wo '11 call 'em for short S. and B.
(It stands for a blend that they love) had been making a little too
free
With—I 'd rather not give it a name,.BILL—they call it poetic
afflatus,
Folks would use plainer English, no doubt, if it came over chaps of
our status.
In what's called a ' pseudonymous ' way, I made out, it had been an
old quarrel.
For B. had thought fit to suggest that the singing of S. was immoral;
While S., who is well up in insects, had hit on the neat tit-for-tat,
Of holding up B. to the public as only a sort of £ flat.'
Lor'! how they pitched into each other—in language, you '11 please
understand,
For Poets, like Females, in shines make more use of the tongue than
the hand.
In fact, B. and S. in their battle reminded this party, for one,
Of a couple of Billingsgate fish-fags a-slanging each other like fun
The names they exchanged I 'd not mention in hearing of persons
polite,
For poetical cursing and swearing beats 'Gate slanging clean out of
sight.
Then they quoted each other's worst lines, and if poetry's all such
as theirs,
"From being a Bard Lord deliver us!" ought to be one of our
prayers.
For it seems that the sum and the substance of what they call
"glorious song"
Is meanings amazingly weak put in language uncommonly strong.
But at last, when I thought that the shindy must end in the
punching of heads,
They took and they called in the lawyers to settle the case in fists'
steads;
Which of course it was nuts to the bar-chaps, and didn't they poke
fun and chaff!
Out of love-letters read in full Court 'AliBY 'AwxiNS ne'er got
such a laugh.
Well, so far as I twigged it, the verdict was, "Bad as arb B. and
his verse,
MB. S. and his Songs and his slanging are one and a half per cent.
worse."
Though I must say if / had been called on to sum up the rights of
the pother,
My tip would have been " Pot and Kettle—six one and half-dozen
the other."
BILL, ray boy, you will never find me liquor up at the sign of "The
Laurel,"
Nor try that A. POLLEE'S best bitters which beats gin at breeding
a quarrel.
The tap of Parnassus be blowed! if it oversets stomach and brain
As bad as the best Hamburgh Sherry, and worse than petroleum
Champagne.
I always ranked poets as duffers, but blest if I thought 'em such
muffs
As to cry " Stinking fish!" in that fashion, in chaff taking refuge
from cult's.
But if B. and S. and their brethren would trust to Philistine's
advising.
They 'd cover their sewerage up out of sight, after deodorising.
They may tell us that that's the manure for poetry's lilies and
roses,
What I know is, that all who go that way keep handkerchiefs held
to their noses.
JUSTICE TO IRELAND.
THE following paper, picked up in the passage between the
Underground Railway and the Clock Tower, and evidently relating
to the Irish Land Question, appears to be founded on the give and
take principle (give everything to the Tenant, take everything from
the Landlord), and is likely to satisfy even the demands of that
mysterious assembly the Metropolitan O'Donnel 82 Club. It is
accompanied by a short note, as under:—
DEAB FATHER PAT,
BUTT is a bosthoon: his Bill is all milk and water. I enclose
a rough sketch of what might be worked into a good Tenants' Bill.
I will be glad to get any hint you may have to offer. Don't spare
the Landlords. In haste, Yours ever, O'C. P.
FATHEH PAT MULLIGAN, Ballinrobe, Co. Mayo.
1. Landlords to be offered 99-year Leases of their estates; renew-
able for ever on remission of one year's rent to the Tenants.
2. Fair Rents to bo fixed by a competent tribunal: such as a
Committee of Three, consisting of the Parish Priest, the Curate, and
a Tenant-Farmcr, holding not less than ten acres, and the bond-fide
owner of at least one pig.
3. All improvements to be allowed for: on the principle that in
consideration of every pound laid out by the Tenant ten per cent.
shall be deducted from the rent.
4. Absentee Landlords to pay a tax of twenty-five per cent, on
the gross rental.
5. Any absentee for five consecutive years to forfeit his estate,
which shall be divided amongst the rightful owners of the soil, that
is to say, the small Farmers. N.B.—Small Farmers to be defined as
holders of not more than thirty acres.
6. Evictions to be totally abolished; except in cases where no
rent has been paid for ten years, at the end of which period an
ejectment can be served. The ejectment must however be cancelled
on payment of arrears for a term not to exceed six months.
7. The descendants of the original proprietors of estates confiscated
within the last two hundred and fifty years to be entitled to claim
the said estates; and, on proof of their descent, possession shall be
given up by the present holder. Compensation to an amount not
exceeding one year's rent to be given by the incomer. In eases
where litigation arises, the costs shall, whatever the result, be
charged on the estate.
Floating Slums.
Fnoxt some resolutions lately passed by the Rugeley Ruri-Decanal
Conference, it seems that the" condition of the Canal Population is
very deplorable, and, especially, that children are living in canal-
boats under most unwholesome conditions. The charity bestowed
on Gutter Children might be extended to Canal Children; for, as
for the unfortunate little ones there is, we much fear, little to choose
between the Canal and the Gutter.
'' What's in a Name ? »
NOT long ago there was a discussion as to the suitability of th •
names given to Her Majesty's ships. If the discussion had extended
;o the fitness of the names of officers, Mr. Punch would not,
perhaps, have had the pleasure of congratulating a Mn. JAMES
TBEMBLE on his appointment as Staff Surgeon to the Terror!
THE END or THE LONDON SEASON.—Disappointment.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

f
^&8i!&^ **^i^ HETHER Russia have found a head, as well as sinews of war,
for the Servian army, is more than LORD DEBUT knows, or, at
least, is disposed to tell LORD CAJIPEHDOWN (Lords, Monday,
July 3). LORD STANLEY OF ALDERLEY, who seems to keep his own
little bird in most of the public Offices, moved a vote of censure
on LORD CARNARVON for not bestowing more attention on the
affairs of the Malay Peninsula between January, 1874, and October, 1875. (Nothing like being exact in the dates of an indictment.)
LORD CARNARVON defended his policy in the Straits. The country was ten thousand miles in extent. Annexation was out of the
question, and the best course was to appoint Residents—(Punch does not envy them their " residential occupation" under the circum-
stances)—to act in concert with the native chiefs. Discords will occur in the best-conducted concerts. He had rapped SIB W. JEHVOIS
over the knuckles as hard as was fair to an energetic Governor. It was a choice of difficulties in a case of Straits, and he had tried to
choose the least. LORD KIMBERLEY backed up his successor. LORD LAWXENCE pointed out that this was a case where the Government
had ventured upon a dangerous step, after getting rid of the native Indian force which would have enabled them to take it without
danger. A hint to the economists a outrance.
More Eastern questions from EARL DELAWARE and LOBD GRANVILLE, who asked when the papers would be published that would
inform Parliament as to the Eastern policy of the Government. LORD DEBBY promised the papers as soon as possible. War having
broken out there was no objection now to show the steps that had led to it.
(Commons.)—After a variety of important Home questions, e.g.,—how to get people who fall off the Embankment out of the water;
the trial and sentence of JAMES TIMONY, an injured youth of seventeen, at Belfast; the limits of Lords-Lieutenant's right of inter-
ference at Elections; Bathing in the Serpentine; the Prosecution of the owner of a rotten ship at Liverpool; the closing of the National
Gallery in the height of the season; the Statistics of Traffic at Hyde Park corner: British Museum Salaries; education of children in
canal-boats; wound up by a personal explanation between SIB. E. WATKIN and SIB ROBERT PEEL—in which the latter made one state-
ment, with which Honourable Members heartily agreed—that he had been too long a member of that House—the MARQUIS OF HART-
INOTON took the liberty of asking the Sphinx at the head of Her Majesty's Government, when the papers that would throw light.on the
Government policy in the Eastern Question would be published. "As soon as possible," said the Sphinx.

Brown (to the old Family Scmanf). "THERE, NURSE! WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?"
Old Nurse (she came from West Suffolk, and had never seen the Sea). "LOR', ME. CHARLES, DO IT ALLUS KEEP A MUDDLIN' ABEAOUT
'LIKE THAT?"
Which answer of the darkling Sphinx,
Unsatisfactory to GINX,
Brought up that bold, bald Baby's face
To beard B. D. in pride of place.
Let the House howl, GINX blenches not,
In spite of HERVEY'S snuce all hot:
The House may hold his question rude,
But with a Motion he '11 conclude.
"What' Our Own' at Vienna knew
Was no more than the House's due.
'Gainst asking this there stands no law—
That asked, his Motion he 'd withdraw."
Whereon the SPEAKER, crustily,
"I told the Member for Dundee'
His speech must closed by Motion be,
And now his Motion he withdraws!—"
Then GINX, "I own the House's laws,
And move the Adjournment of the House."
Whereon blithe BIGGAK. hat did dowse,
And begged, kind friend, to second GINX.
Upon his legs this brought the Sphinx,
Who, after due contempt conveyed
Of GINX, that questioner undismayed,
"Hoped no anonymous ' Our Own
Would in the House's face be thrown:
Let the House wait a few short houjg,
Till, with consent of the great Pow£rt,
The published papers could make known,
Not the Times' wisdom, but OUR" OWN."
Then BRIGHT, large-looming on the field,
Threw over GINX his ample shield:
No Baby he, a veteran wight,
With more than thrice ten years of fight.
"The Session wanes, the papers wait;
Short grows the season for Debate;
The country frets, as well as GINX.
Needs thrice five minutes for the Sphinx
To utter, calm, condensed, and clear,
What House and Country yearn to hear.
The Oracle no longer dumb,
E'en if the bad to worst should come,
The House would know its steersman's star,
And shape a course, not drift, to war.
But of this let the Sphinx beware,
One thing Old England will not bear—
Our might ranged with the Turks along,
'Gainst those who rise against their wrong."
Then FAWCETT struck into the fight—
His war-cry, " Ditto to JOHN BRIGHT!"
And e'en the Doctor braved disdain,
And dashed the dew-drops from his mane,
And, midst a laugh that shook the hall,
Foretold that " Turkey needs must fall."
Till HARTINOTON, the Doctor's foil,
Poured on the waves his smoothing oil:
'' The House, no doubt, would gladly learn—
For information needs must yearn—
But papers policy declare;
And papers ask time to prepare.
Then let us wait; put question by,
Till papers lend us wings to fly,
If need be, in the Sphinx's face,
And his who holds ' another place.""
(Punch asks pardon for rhyming; but the ancient Oracles were
always asked, and answered, in verse.)
The Second Reading of the Prisons Bill followed; every man
fighting for his own hand; a knot of the bucolicals refusing to dis-
mount from their hobby. Visiting Justiceship. But CROSS wins in a
canter. The Quarter Sessions Benches have pronounced for the
Bill by a large majority, and Second Reading was carried by the
overwhelming majority of 295 to 96.
Tuesday (Lords).—Union of Benefices Bill reported, and Bill for
Improving the Dwellings of the Poor in Whiteohapel and Limehouse
district got into Committee. LORD SHAFTESBUBY, as by right,
rejoiced in the advent of this the first (he hoped) of a long series of
Bills for the improvement of the dwellings of the working classes in
our London slums. But he warned the promoters not to go too fast
in pulling down, till they had seen to the intermediate housing of
those whom improvement ousted. A wise and much wanted
caution. Pull down the rookeries, but don't forget the rooks.
(Commons.) Morning Sitting.—There are some questions more
awful than even the Eastern. Such was WHALLET'S this morning.
Had MB. DISRAELI made due inquiry into CHIEF JUSTICE WHITE-
HEAD'S statement that the POPE, and not the QUEEN, exercised para-
mount authority in Ireland in certain cases? ME. DISRAELI may
oppose a stony and Sphinxian silence to the interrogatories of the
House about the Turkish war, but he knows better than to trifle with
the interrogatories of ,WHALLEY. He said he had come down five or
six times to the House prepared to answer the question—if he could.
But he could not attach a definite idea to it. But as far as he
could understand the question—(the rogue! he understands it well
enough)—he should say that if a person had such confidence in the
POPE that he is determined to obey him, he didn't see how the

QUERY.
Is IT AN ADVANTAGE THAT TALL PEOPLE LOOK TALLEK, AND SHORT
PEOPLE SHOKTER ON THE RINK?
Government was to prevent him. (Doesn't he, indeed? As if he
couldn't begin by putting down the Jesuits, who now swarm in the
Legislature, the Lniversities, the Public Schools, the liberal pro-
fessions, the School Boards, the public departments, the establish-
ments of the nobility, and elsewhere.) He declined to be responsible
for the observations of Judges in Ireland. (We should think ne did.)
It was awfully hot and choky in the House, and, as iced drinks
are not allowed to be handed round, as in the American Hall of
Congress, Members were awfully bored by SCLATER-BOOTH'S long
statement of local indebtedness and income. After all, the total of
local debt is only between £90,000.000 and £100,000 000; the income
about £60,000,000. Is this bagatelle the sort of thing to be bothered
about in such weather? But if they tried to burk SCLATER-BOOTH
by not listening, they absolutely kicked against FAWCETT'S amend-
ment, touching the unfair incidence of local taxation on occupiers as
against owners; and, with all the help of GOSCHEN, CHTLDEHS, and
the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQTTEH, just contrived to shunt the
Bill into Committee and left it there.
SIR HENRY JAMES tried to get Members into working gear again
over the Appellate Judicature Bill. Ho said the business in the
Courts was at a regular dead-lock.
Much the sweltering House cared for that! The sitting was
suspended at seven, and then, when the House should have met for
business again at nine, it didn't, and MR. BIGGAR, useful for once,
had the House Counted Out before doing a stroke of work. Too hot.
Wednesday.—CowrER-TEMPLE moved Second Reading of his
Bill for admitting Ladies with Foreign Medical Degrees to Practise
in England.
LORD SANDON said Government was prepared to take up MR.
RUSSELL GURNET'S Bill for enabling the Medical Corporations, if
they liked, to admit Women to Practise. On which MR. COWPEH-
TEMPLE withdrew his Bill, preferring a side entrance to practise.
even with a Medical Beadle stationed at it, to the back door he had
proposed to open.
Thursday (Lords).—The Commons Bill for Second Reading, re-
commended by the DTTKE OP RICHMOND as carefully framed in the
interests of Owners. From what MR. CROSS said for it in the Com-
mons Punch had thought it was framed in the interests of the
Public. I-et us hope that, for once, they are identical.
(Commons.)—The Second Reading of the Cambridge University
Bill, mildly moved, ill a hot and sleepy House, by MR. WALPOLE.
The House dull over it. Even DILKE did not wake them up in his
new character of a maintainer of the status quo. Like Lo^vE, he
has faith in " idle fellows," and does not much oelieve in Professors
and the Endowment of Research. Nor does MR. FORSYTH. But he
is strongly opposed to Fellowships for life. Of course, as the Ladies'
man for Mari-le-bon par excellence he ought to be opposed to such
an abominably celibate institution.
DR. PLAYFAIH imported a momentary animation to the debate by
puffing the Scotch Universities at the expense of the English, and
contriving to tread, with singular ingenuity-, on all English Uni-
versity men's toes, however wide apart, defending the increase of
the Professorate as a corrective of the evils of competitive examina-
tions, and clerical fellowships as a means of liberalising the clergy.
This brought MR. BERESFORD HOPE into the ring; and that "friend
of the brave in peril's darkest hour" dealt the Scotch Chicken
several heavy counters. He was followed by that lively light-
weight, LORD E. FITZMATJRICE, who, on the whole, supported the
Bill. After him arose the encyclopaediac Member for the Elgin
Burghs, and served out one of those elaborate concoctions of Duff,
in which the plums bear so small a proportion to the suet that only
the strongest Parliamentary digestion is equal to them. His picture
of Oxford-wants—in the shape of Professorships yet to be—was
appalling. That rising young man, MR. MARTEN, recalled the dis-
cussion to earth and practicabilities.
MR. GOSCHEN took very much the LOWE line on the Endowment of
Fellows, as against that of Professors; while SIR W. HAHCOTTRT
chaffed the Bill all round, and declared that the endowment of
research would probably lapse into the research of endowments.
(If it wasn't SIR WILLIAM who made that joke it ought to have
been, for it is sharp, as well as chaffy, and so quite in SIR WIL-
LIAM'S way.)
MR. HARDY wound up the evening with a pleasant conciliatory
comment on what was really one of the best debates of the Session,
allowing for the weather. The Chelsea Baronet withdrew his
Amendment, and the Bill passed Second Reading.
Friday.—LORD GRANVTLLE will take np Extradition next Thurs-
day, not; a day too soon. Shoals of rogues are already rushing both
ways through the torn net across the Atlantic.
(Commons.)—Morning Sitting—and snoozing. LORD SANDON gave
a sketch of the amendments he proposes in Committee on his Educa-
tion Bill. The Member for Bradford will not be ashamed to own
himself their foster-father. Long lawyers' talk on Appellate Juris-
diction. "Wants strengthening. What are so few judges among^ so
many? Consensus of lawyers in favour of more judges. Vous ctes
orfevre, Maitre Josse. "Nothing like Horse-hair," quoth the wig-
wearers. But suppose we were content with fewer judges on bane?
Are three big wigs absolutely wanted to split one straw? Spread
thinner they'll go further, like the schoolboy's butter.
Evening Sitting. — While MR. DILLWYN was talking about
Lunatics some wise and weary Member had the happy thought,
"What lunatics we are to be sitting here, a dozen of us, when we
might be in bed!" and got the House Counted Out, for the second
time this hot week, at ten minutes after ten.
JOHN AND JONATHAN.
THE Sanctum had been newly decorated. The curtains were now
of silk, and represented stars and stripes. A batch of books had
been added to the library, with backs lettered "LONGFELLOW,
"BRETT HARTE," and " HOLMES." Everything had been done that
could be done to give the room a transatlantic appearance. The
chairs ran on tramways, the bells worked by electricity, and com-
munication was maintained with the floor above and the floor bulow
by means of cleverly concealed lifts.
"Now, let me see," said Mr. Punch, looking round his apartment
with great satisfaction, "is everything ready f'
Toby replied in the affirmative.
"Then," murmured the Sage, "I don't think that our American
Cousin can find anything in the room at which to take offence.
Stay, Toby, you may take Martin Chuzzlewitoutof the bookshelves.
It is a very excellent novel, but it is just possible that our visitor

He had scarcely finished speaking when a secret door flew open
and a rosy-cheeked, curly-headed gentleman in the very prime of
life walked out.
"Good morning, Mr. P^mch," said the newcomer with a cheerful
smile. "That 's rather an expeditious way of travelling. I came
down from the room above in something less than no time. _

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"And infinitely safer," remarked Mr. Punch, "You are looking
well of course, my dear JOHN, and yet I have seen you looking
better."
"I should think, so," returned the portly gentleman, with a slight
sigh. "It has been an anxious time lately. What with foreign
loans and the complications of the Eastern Question, I absolutely
have known no rest for months. Then Dizzr, my head man, has
got hold of my books and keeps them closed against me. Whenever
I ask for them he makes an excuse."
"I should insist upon seeing them," said Mr. Punch, firmly.
"I shall, the next time I want them," was the reply, and then
JOHN continued, "DIZZY may be a very clever fellow, but I like to
manage my own affairs. And now, Mr. Punch, why have you
asked me to come here?"
"To meet a friend " (the guest "smiled) "and a relative."
The smile disappeared.
"If I am obliged to meet a relative with so much formality, I do
not think that I shall care for his acquaintance. But who is he?"
"Why, our American Cousin, JONATHAN," replied Mr. Punch,
watching his guest's face steadily. JOHN looked far from pleased.
"I am sorry you have brought us together," he said. "JONATHAN
is a swaggering, vulgar, uneducated, swindling"
"Stop! stop!" cried Mr. Punch. "You really don't know him.
Come, you shall see him at once," and a slight pressure applied to
another nob near the fireplace opened another secret door. A slim,
gentlemanly-looking man entered the room. He greeted Mr. Punch
cordially.
"My dear Sir," said he, speaking with the slightest accent pos-
sible—an' accent which lifted the small words into undue promi-
nence—" I congratulate you upon your lift. I came from your
waiting-room below in less than no time."
Mr. Punch noticed that his first visitor was moving towards the
door. "Come," said the Sage, "you two cousins should know one
another well—thoroughly well. Now, my dear JOHN, here is
your Cousin JONATHAN. JONATHAN, let me introduce you to JOHN
BULL."
"Welcome, Cousin!" said the American, distrustfully.
"Pleased to see any Cousin, however distant," said the English-
man, pompously.
"Nonsense!" cried Mr. Punch. "Onlv the Atlantic Ocean
divides you, and that little affair has been bridged over by half-
a-dozen cables."
"I was thinking of our family-tree," said JOHN. "My Cousin
must be several times removed."
"Nonsense, again!" interrupted the Sage. "The onlv thing
that can remove you two kinsmen is misunderstanding; and as for
the'family-tree, why, plant a bough of it anywhere—in Asia, Africa,
America, or Australasia—and it will flourish as only such an ever-
green can flourish. Nonsense!—shake hands! Remember you are
not only men, but brothers."
"' Look before you leap,' is a capital motto," muttered the
American.
"' Don't buy a pig in a poke' is excellent, albeit homely, advice,"
murmured the Englishman.
"That's all very well," said Mr. Punch; "but I don't want you
to do either the one or the other. Let's be honest and open. Come,
JOHN, speak frankly. What have you to say in disparagement of
JONATHAN?"
"He is unrefined, he talks slang, he uses a revolver, he loves
rowdies, he never did a generous action in his life, and—most un-
pardonable sin of all—he hates me!"
"Don't speak!" said Mr. Punch, as the American Cousin sprang
to his feet.
"JOHN," he continued, "you are harsh and wrong. Because
Shoddy spends its too easily gained money in Europe, you must
not take Shoddy as the national representative. Your Cousin, when
you find him at home, is hospitable as a gentleman should be, is
cultivated as a gentleman should be, is honourable as a gentleman
should be. And as to his hating you—why, man, he whistles '' Rule,
Britannia!" quite as often as " Hail, Columbia!" Now, Sir, it
is your turn. What have you to say against JOHN BULL?"
He is cold-hearted, scornful, mean, and revengeful. He can't
forgive us the glorious work of the Fourth of July.
Don't speak a word, JOHN!" said Mr. Punch, excitedly.
"Now, JONATHAN, you .are in the wrong. Cold-hearted, scornful,
and mean! Why, he is as proud of you as ever a father was of a
child. Revengeful and unforgiving! Why, he helps to keep
'the Fourth' himself! And as to your Independence—why, he
declares that you were in the right, and tries his hardest to make
his other children free. Ask your neighbour, pretty Miss CANADA,
ask that..promising young fellow, MASTEE AUSTRALIA, what they
think of the old boy, and they will tell you that JOHN BULL is
the kindest, the best-tempered, and warmest-hearted old buffer in
the world."
"Briton Major," said JONATHAN, "we have both been wrong."
"Briton Minor," replied JOHN, "blood is thicker than water."
Two hands were gripped as only men of the stout old Anglo-
Saxon race can grip.
"That's right! f> cried Mr. Punch, enthusiastically. "There's
a sight that will cheer the weak and terrify tyrants. Combined, my
lads, you may defy the world. Let's liquor!"
And then with hands firmly clasped — the Past remembered
without pain, the Present welcomed without shame—the two kinsmen
drank heartily and hopefully to a glorious Future.

STAND AT ,EA,S£ —
REGULATIONS FOR WIMBLEDON.
8th July, 1876. War Office (Intelligence Department],
85, Fleet Street, E.G.
FIELD - MARSHAL
PUNCH has much
pleasure in express-
ing his perfect satis-
faction with the
conduct and sol-
dierly bearing of
the troops recently
reviewed by H.R.H.
the PEINCE OF
WALES in Hyde
Park. The regular
infantry and cavalry
were, of course, all
that could be de-
sired. The London
Militia, too, de-
served the Field-
Marshal's unquali-
fied commendation.
It is to be regretted,
however, that that
excellent batallion,
the King's Own
Royal Tower Ham-
lets Militia (now
doing duty at the
Mobilisation, Head
Quarters of the Regiment at Cheltenham) was not included in the
field-state. The march past on the 1st. instant, was supposed to
include the garrison of London, and that garrison cannot be con-
sidered complete without the hereditary custodians of the Tower.
Turning to the Volunteers, FIELD-MABSHAL PUNCH can heartily
congratulate them upon the progress they have made during the last
fifteen years. On the 1st. instant Itheir steadiness and smartness
suggested that they were closely imitating the excellent example set
for them by the Regulars and the Militia-forces, whose discipline is
maintained by a strict administration of the Mutiny Act. Under
these circumstances "the Field-Marshal has no hesitation in issuing
the following regulations for Wimbledon, in the confident hope
that they will be received with respect and obedience:—
1. Volunteers should appear in uniform. The habit of wearing a
military tunic and a straw hat should be discontinued.
2. Volunteers should salute their officers. The habit of singing
"Tommy make room for your Uncle," or any equally popular ditty
when passing a General, should be discontinued.
3. Volunteers should be careful to keep some uniformity in the
Bitching of their tents. The habit of decorating the canvas with
facetious pictures or caricatures of unpopular commanders should
be discontinued.
4. Volunteers at all times should maintain the strictest discipline.
The habit of regarding Wimbledon as a free and easy pic-nie instead
of a military camp of instruction should be discontinued.
With these few regulations (which he trusts will be accepted in
§ood part, and observed with good heart) FIELD-MABSHAL PUNCH
ids the Volunteers farewell for the present. He trusts that they
will have fine weather, for what he hopes will be a useful holiday.

PHOTOGRAPHING THE FIRST-BORN.
GUARDIANS IN GAOL.
SUTBEME COTTBT OF APPEAL.
Sittings in Fleet Street, before LOED CHIEF JUSTICE PUNCH.
The Queen v. the Guardians of the Keighley Union.
MR. WIGGIXS, Q.C., applied for an order to'reverse the judgment
of the LOHD CHIEF JUSTICE in^the Queen's Bench, under which the
Defendants stood committed for contempt of Court, incurred by first
pretending to comply with and then disobeying a mandamus enjoining
them to perform the duty incumbent on them, which they had long
neglected, of giving the proper directions to the Vaccination Officer
to proceed against parents who refused to have their children vac-
cinated. The mandamus had been issued in the other Court con-
sequently upon conduct on the part of the Defendants brought
under the notice of CHIEF JUSTICE PUNCH some time ago.
The LOED CHIEF JUSTICE asked on what ground the appeal
against the mandate of his learned Brother was made.
MB. WIGGINS said on that of the extreme stupidity of the Defen-
dants, who could not possibly be brought to understand that they
ought to obey the law. A dialogue, the report of which occupied
nearly a column of a newspaper, on this point passed in Court
between LOED CHIEF JUSTICE COCKBUBN and their Chairman,
ME. MILNEB, who, as the head, must be supposed to have the most
brains of them all—except a Mi. SAMUEL JOHNSON; this Gentleman
having repudiated his colleagues' acts, and purged himself of
contempt.
LOED CHIEF JUSTICE PUNCH said that ME. SAHUEL JOHNSON had
vindicated his name
ME. WIGGINS proceeded to say that the LOED CHIEF JUSTICE in
the Court below in vain endeavoured to make the Chairman of the
Keighley Guardians comprehend that it was their place to execute
and not to construe or correct the law. Their inability to have
this simple idea beaten into their heads, he (Ms. WIGGINS) would
submit indicated a density of intellect which rendered them deserv-
ing of pity, rather than punishment.
His Lordship, in reply to the learned Counsel, said that the De-
fendants' intellects, if they had any, were evidently; dense indeed.
No doubt they had both acted, and refused to act, in ignorance; but
mere ignorance of the law was no excuse. Their ignorance was
extreme; they were as ignorant of Law as of Medicine: and, pro-
bably, of everything else: they showed crass ignorance. But merely
crass ignorance could not absolve those who ought to have known
better., He (LoED CHIEF JUSTICE PUNCH) could not interfere between
that ignorance and its consequences. However, he was not sure that
the Keighley Guardians' contumacy was not owing to a sadder defect
than that of mere knowledge. He recollected that they concluded
one of their first Anti-Vaccination meetings by adjourning to the
Madhouse, and he (LoED CHIEF JUSTICE PUNCH) remembered saying
at the time, they ought to have remained there. Their obstinacy in
resisting the Vaccination Act suggested actual derangement; and
this all the rather that they had displayed an evasion and cunning
which were special notes of insanity. This, if it were so, would
render them irresponsible for their acts, but not entitle them to be dis-
charged from custody. People who behaved as they had done, labour-
ing under fixed ideas and delusions, were dangerous lunatics, who
required to be looked after—they ought to be shut up, and not let go
about. He would take time to consider his decision; and Defend-
ants might be inspected by a medical man, to see if they were crazy.
In the meanwhile, if not incurable, they would perhaps come to
their senses, apologise for their misconduct, undertake to repair it,
and so purge themselves of contempt, when, doubtless, they would
be released on payment of necessary costs. Otherwise, all he (LoBD
CHIEF JUSTICE PUNCH) would be able to do for them would be to
make an order for their removal from the County Prison to a Lunatic
Asylum, and then the only doubt .on his (LOED CHIEF JUSTICE
PUNCH'S) mind would be, whether the Institution to which it would
be proper to send them was a Refuge for the Insane or an Asylum
for Idiots.
NO OFFENCE.

HAPPY THOUGHTS.
To Fresh Fields and Pastures new—Seeking for Information—An
Irish Acquaintance wanted—On the Track.
RIENDS recom-
mend me to try
"a thorough
change." By all
means. My Aunt,
who is continu-
ally practising a
melancholy song
with a refrain
about being
"flung away to
die " in some out-
of-the-way place,
—a "wilder-
ness," I think,—
and who has two
deaf Ladies and
a Nephew (sus-
pected of having
fits when by him-
self) coming to
stay with her for
a fortnight,
thinks it " a pity
I should go away
just now. I don't.
But where to?
I am still turning the subject over, and am inclining towards
Ireland.
I remember this heading to a chapter in Nicholas Nicklety,
"Doubts and fears begin to disturb the plotter,"—or words to that
effect. This is my case. There is something so remarkably novel
in the idea of my going to Ireland, that something, I feel sure, will
happen to prevent it.
It now breaks upon me for the first time that I know nothing at all
about Ireland. I nave talked politically about Ireland, I have read
LEVEE, CHOKEK, 8. 0. HALL, LOVEE,—I remember vividly most of
CBUIKSHANK'S hideous pictures in the history of the Irish Rebellion,
and I. have seen the Irish dramas by MESSES. BOUCICAULT and
FALCONEB, which have impressed upon me such characters as Danny
Mann, a jovial Priest (who could brew whiskey punch, and make a
speech which " brought down the house "), another Priest who could
hit out on occasion, a gentlemanly courteous Priest, picturesque
peasant girls, Colleen Baions and Colleen Rhus, and good-for-nothing,
self-sacrificing ne'er-do-wells, with a powerful affection for the''ould
stock " and "the Masther." and an intimate and practical acquaint-
ance with shillelaghs, potheen, poaching, and the county gaols.
I do not believe that these pictures represent " Ireland as it is."
Equally clearly, it must be the simplest thing possible to find
some person, or persons, who do know all about it. Among my
acquaintance—let me see—as I think it over, I remember several
Irishmen. But, as I 've never known them to be out of England,
except when I 've met them in Boulogne, or in Germany, the question
arises, Do they know much about their native country?
The man of all others is, now I think of it, TIM MAHONT.
Note (in Memorandum-Jiook).—Ca.\l on TIM MAHONY, and ask
him about Ireland.
TLM MAHONY'S address is a difficulty. Odd! often as 1 've met
TIM MAHONY, and, long as I 've known him, yet it now strikes me,
for the first time, that I 've never been to TIM'S own house, or
rooms, or whatever he has to live in; that I 've never dined with TIM
at his Clubj or at his expense anywhere; and that whenever I have
met Tnr, it it was not at somebody else's house, or somebody else's
dinner party, or somebody else's Club, it has invariably been in the
street. Of course I cannot waste my time in walking about the
streets in the hope of meeting TIM MAHONY. Stay! I have written
to him. Let me see, at what address P Why, invariably at some-
body else's address, and never the same twice running. TIM,
in doto, flashes across me like a revelation. He is like a social Will-
o'-the-Wisp. I do not think this a very good simile, as people do
not ask Will-o'-the-Wisps to stay with them for a fortnight; and
TLM is never without an invitation. At least such must be the case,
as he apparently resides nowhere, and lives everywhere. If he can't
get an invitation he must make them himself.
Because at this moment I particularly want to see him, he is most
certain not to turn up. If he did turn up he would be welcome, for
days, at our little out-of-town cottage—welcome as the flowers
in Spring. If at this moment TIM were not wanted, he would
appear. He is the sort of man, of whom'it may be safely said,
that " he is here to-day and not gone to-morrow,"—or the day after,
or the day after that; or, with a little encouragement, for weeks.
In fact, as to his stay, "it." as the song says, "may be for years
and it may be for ever." Thus,—TIM will find himself with nothing
to do in Town. Time hangs heavily on his hands. It suddenly
strikes him that " he hasn't seen old BUNGAY for years."
"Gad!" says TIM to himself, "I'll go and see old DICK BUNGAY."
If I (or anybody else, for the matter of that) am with him at the
moment, he will add, " You come, too. Come down'to old BUNG AY'S.
He '11 be delighted."
I object that I do not know BUSGAY, that in point of fact I've
never spoken to BUNGAY in my life, nor even seen him.
TIM is immensely astonished. His manner expresses such im-
measurable pity for me, as having lived so long without knowing
BUNGAY, that I am really quite disconcerted.
"What!" he exclaims. "Not know old BUNGAY. My dear
fellow," he goes on with great empressement, "you must know him.
Come down with me. BUNGAY will be only too pleased. Come
along! we 11 take the next train, and be with him to dinner."
It still occurring to me that BUNGAY may not view this descent
upon him in the same light as does TIM, I get off for the present,
promising that if, while TIM is staying chez BUNGAY, TIM will
induce him to ask me, I will accept with pleasure. Off goes TIM:
stops there for three months, and when he finds things a little
monotonous, I receive my long-promised invitation from TIM on
behalf of BUNGAY.
[But this is by the way, only that it is necessary in order to under-
stand TIM MAHONY, and the difficulty in rinding him; because
from BUNGAY'S he may have gone to Northumberland to see his
friend, Old SIIOETMOEE; from SHOETMOEE'S to Devonshire; and
from Devonshire to Brighton, to stay with some one who has
been asking him so often that he's " quite ashamed of himself," he
says, on arriving, "for not having been to see him before."]
Well, I am supposing TIM saying to himself, "I'll go and see
old DICK BUNGAY." He is off at once, to the waiting-room of a
station (" most convenient place a waiting-room," says TIM, nah-ely),
where he has left his portmanteau, bag, hat-box, and greatcoat; then
he obtains the correct time of the train's starting, andin another two
hours he is marching up the well-kept drive leading to the front
door of Bunfjay Hall; and the Ladies of the house (who are un-
acquainted with TIM, and who therefore have a rich and unexpected
treat in store for them), sitting in the drawing-room, wonder who
on earth their visitor can be at this hour, when DICK BUNGAY, fresh
from the river—the fish and himself being but just arrived from the
same place—slaps one hand down on the other as he exclaims, "Why,
hang me, if it isn't TLM MAHONY!"
"DiCK, old boy," cries TIM, heartily, "how are you P"
Thereupon TIM shakes hands most warmly with DICK BUNGAY,—
with a warmth indeed which communicates itself at once to DICK
BUNGAY, who expresses himself immensely pleased at seeing him:
in a few minutes more he is glowing with hearty hospitality, and
in a quarter of an hour he is ablaze with open-house generosity.
MES. BUNGAY receives TIM under the impression that her husband
has asked him, and forgotten to mention it. And her guests, the
three MISSES GLENTLLIEE, are also delighted, for there's a chance of
a little excitement, and flirtation for one at a time at least.
Then TIM sets to work to praise everything, and to please every-

me "—and then he will playfully remind "Old DICK " of that won-
derful claret he has in the cellar, and which he must have up. And
Old DICK remembers that when they last met, he had mentioned
such a claret to ,him, and wonders which it was. A regret passes
across his mind that he hasn't called at his Grocer's in the nearest
county town, so as to provide for TIM'S unforeseen visit,—for, at the
first flush, TIM will be enthusiastic about everything, even to prais-
ing the Grocer's "sound dinner claret at 13s. a dozen." But the
second evening TIM will frown, shake his head, and hint that " This
is not the same we had last night." At the third dinner he will
insist on having the best out, and will be satisfied with nothing but
the best, even if he goes down with his host, under pretence of
admiringthe "first-rate cellar," and fetching it up himself.
Then BUNGAY hopes, and MES. BUNGAY hopes, and the GLEN-
TILTEES hope, that TIM will be able to stay a few days now he is
there, which being exactly the object TIM has had in view all along,
he at once protests that "alas! being^ so very busy just now in
town "—this TIM always says when he is miles away from London,
"is exactly what, he regrets to say, he can not do." "Don't ask
. 'night. 1 've promised. .L/ADY ASTEACHAN—you
CHANS"—DICK BUNGAY nods, and his wife wonders where her
husband could have met them, but is unwilling to show ignorance
before the GLENTILTEES—" I 've promised Old ASTEACHAN to, be
back for his Dumb Crambo party to-night—at least." he adds,,to
leave a loophole for his hosts to press their invitation, "I said, if I 'm
not with you by nine-thirty, don't expect me."

"Then," says BUNGAY, cleverly, "if you 're not there they won't
expect you. Better stay here •with us." He puts it cordially, with,
however, a still lurking regret that he hasn't a supply of the Grocer's
at 13s. a doz.
"No," replies TIM, who has no more idea of moving from his
g resent comfortable q uarters than he has of attempting to fly over
t. Paul's,—"No," he says, shaking his head, and pretending to
ruminate over all the pros and cons, of the question, I "m—afraid
—I-can't."
"You must manage it somehow," insists DICK BUNGAY, becoming
proportionately more eager for TIM to stay, as ho hears that he is in
such demand elsewhere.
"If I telegraphed," says TIM, doubtfully, "I might. But," he
considers, then he goes on in a feeling tone, "you see, I 'm staying
with my Grandmother at Stringham. in Hampshire, and, if I 'm not
in by midnight, she gets so uneasy."
Everybody is silent, out of respect to TIM'S feelings, and out of
sympathy with his Grandmother at Stringham. Everybody is more
or less depressed: DICK BUNGAY most of all. So down is he in fact,
that it is on his lips to say, with genuine heartiness, "Well, send
for the old girl and bring her down here. Why not?" But he does
not say this, lest it should savour of disrespect to TIM MAHONY'S
aged relative.
TIM brightens up. He sees a way. He has the will—plenty of it,
and sees the way. He '11 telegraph to the ASTRACHANS and to his
Grandmother; to the first to say that he " Can'tbeupfor Crambo:"
to the second to say, "Shan't be back to-night. Am staying at
BUNGAY'S. Don't be alarmed if not back for a day or two."
"I 'd better word it like that," says TIM, knowingly, to BUNGAY,
"and then she won't be at all nervous."
_BUNGAY agrees with him, and trusts he '11 stay a week or a fort-
night, mentally resolving that his stable-help shall take a cart over
to Slocomb and do business with the Grocer.
TIM thanks him heartily, but doesn't think he '11 be able to stay
quite so long as that. "However," he says, so as not to throw too
great a damper on his host, " I'll see what lean do."
"It's lucky," says TIM presently to his old friend, DICK BUNGAY,
"it's precious lucky that I brought down my portmanteau and bag.
I had two minds about it," says he, "but I thought you'd over-
fersuade me to stop,—I had a presentiment of it,—and so, says I.

and a hearty slap on the back, conveying to BITNGAY, in a delicate
way, the sort of treatment he (BUNGAY) might expect from him (Tra
MAHONY), if their positions were reversed as host and guest.
"That 's what 1 like about you," says TIM to Old DICK BUNGAY,
confidentially. "You 're a real hospitable old boy! No formalities,
no long invitations, no fixing dates. No, here I am, rough and
ready, and you take me as you find me."
"Exactly," replies Old D'HCK, feeling: that TIM has found Aim, but,
all the same, immensely pleased with himself in the character of a
fine old English Gentleman, keeping open house and welcoming a
hundred TIM MAHONYS.
All this Hashes across my mind about Tnr, and so, when I want
to know something about Ireland (as I do at this present moment), I
think where I can get hold of TIM, and it occurs to me as a
Happy Thought.—Wire to DICK BUNGAY, Bungay Hall, and ask

SIR SALAR'S ODD OFFERING.
THE Standard has the following curious piece of news in its
Court Circular of a few days ago:—
"SiR SALAR Ju.vo was presented to the QUEEN by the MARQUIS OP
SALISBURY, and offered his Mtiygttr as a token of allegiance, which HER
MAJESTY touched and returned."
SHAKSPEARE'S Hindustani Dictionary gives "Muggur" as the
Hindu for an alligator. Why the Indian Statesman should have
chosen this offensive and voracious animal as a token of his
allegiance we cannot conceive—unless he meant it as a delicate way
of conveying that his loyalty was ready to swallow anything. How
ever did he manage to bring it alive from the banks of the Godaveri
to Windsor Castle—to say nothing of the shorter railway transit
from Paddington? We presume it was not a stuffed specimen that
SIB SALAR presented to HER MAJESTY. All this will, let us hope, be
explained in the " Journal" which is pretty sure to see the light on
Sis SALAR JUNG'S return to Hyderabad.
HER MAJESTY "touched and returned" this choice "token."
Would it not have been better taste on the part of Her Majesty's
advisers if they had suggested that she should retain it, as the
nucleus of a Windsor collection of Indian reptiles, in rivalry to the
zoological establishment recently set up by H.R.H at the Regent's
Park for the present, with a view to Sandringham in the future.
Room might surely have been found about the Castle for a tank,
where SIB SALAB JUNK'S "Muggur" might have been bestowed;
or, if HER MAJESTY did not desire to retain so ugly a creature in her
own neighbourhood, a habitation could have been found for it in one
of the many opposition Aquaria that have lately come into existence.
In the Westminster Aquarium it might have given a fillip to the
prosperity of the undertaking, and a better claim than it now has to
the title " Royal."
Perhaps HER MAJESTY hesitated to set a precedent by accepting
this offering. Some future Indian visitor might have thought Turn-
self justified in bringing a cobra or korait into the Royal Presence!
Happy Thought!—can it have been that the Standard has made
a misprint, and that the "muggur" was after all a "nuzzur,"
which we find in our Shakspeare means " an offering made by an
inferior when interviewing a superior."
OUR INTEREST IN TURKEY.
BRITAIN, Great Powers, whilst you the field leave clear,
'Twixt Turk and Slav will never interfere.
Stamboul made safe beneath a neutral hand,
We care not if the Moslem fall or stand.
Then, Christian Slavs, for freedom stoutly fight!
'Gainst Turks and tyrants Heaven defend_ the right!
Time was when Moslem's faith high credit bore;
But Britons now believe in Turks no more.
Their due per-centage since Turks ceased to pay,

The point of interest for the Public to be noted in connection

MR. NEWFANGLE, who has choice rooms in Mn. HAN-

decidedly amtfsed by ME. OLDFANGLE'S opinions.
"Quotes MILTON, eh? Never met with any fellow
who had read him. Why can't he go to BTBON for

"' So, for a good old-gentlemanly vice,

That's common sense. Money lasts. You can't say that
of anything else.

CHLOE, M.D., ON MR. COWPEB-TEMPLE'S BILL.
THE Medical Maidens, dear Punch, are by no means desirous to
learn
At Paris, Berlin, or Vienna, at Leipsic or Zurich or Berne;
They want to be taught by the Doctors of England, and carve their
way through
Vivisection, and all sections else, that to reach M.D. must he cut
through.
They would not aspire to the power of the mighty Physician who sees
In the movement or glance of a patient the signs of the hidden
disease:
Nor dare hope to rival the Surgeon, who needs, that his work may be
done,
Lion's heart, Eagle's eye, Lady's hand—must have Manhood and
Genius in one.
And though there are small operations no Lady is likely to dread,
Yet they feel no particular wish to cut off MB. WHEELHOUSE'S
head.*
But many 'a the sick-room we see—ere it comes to the battle with
Death,
Where Genius is needed to rouse to life's flame a last flicker of
breath—
Where a woman-physician might aid. She that once at blood's
flowing had swooned.
With the deftness of feminine fingers might tenderly bandage a
wound.
As to healing our own sex, of course we are game to do that much;
but then,
Few women have much faith in women: they 'd rather he doctored
by men.
So do you, Mr. Punch, to LORD SANDON (he 's charmingly clever)
give orders
To take up in earnest, this Session, that Bill of the learned
Recorder's:
* Mil. WHEELHOUSE said—" A woman might, no doubt, safely administer
a camomile pill or a doge of salts and senna; but as for a surgical operation,
he would sooner allow her to cut oft'his head than to cut off his leg."
If you will, on the word of a Lady, 1 "11 cure you, without any fee,
Of any slight ailment that ever may trouble you.
CHLOE, M.D.
(Mr. Punch always goes to Judy, M.I)., for slight ailments. Miss
CHLOE seems a good deal more modest in her demands than most of
the agitators on her side of the question. If the Medical Council
and other leading medical bodies could see a way by which women
might obtain a separate medical education, without overtaxing the
staff of the Medical Schools, and afterwards, on passing the needful
examinations, be admitted to practise, within the conditions of their
sex and the limits of their powers, the question which has been
fought with such needless bitterness might be solved to the public

remarkable discrepancy in the newspaper announcement subjoined

We shall probably hear from numerous friends beyond the Tweed

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

ABLIAMENTABY Question as to Press-reported horrors of Christians
massacred, imprisoned, and outraged in Bulgaria, met (Lords,
Monday. July 10) by LOKD DERBY'S cooling answer. SIR HENKY
ELLIOT has been written to. Time has not yet elapsed for his
answer. LOBD DERBY has telegraphed to Sm HENBY to communi-
cate what he knows on the subject with the least possible delay.
15ut other official information does not confirm to anything like the full
extent the appalling statements in the Daily News. That is a
comfort, as far as it goes. But if the Press statements on such
subjects must usually oe taken "with a grain of salt," a grain of
pepper is too often wanted for the official statements and the un-
official statements that reach Officials.
(Commons.)—MB. DISBAELI (in answer to MB. BRTTCEMS unable to
fix a day for the discussion of affairs in Bosnia and Herzegovina,

the official cold douche to MR. FOESTEE, who had questioned him as to the
reported atrocities in Bulgaria.
The PREMIER'S answer was not in good taste. It is unbecoming the Head
of Her Majesty's Government to get a laugh out of the extent of prison accom-
modation in Bulgaria, or the Bashi-Bazouks' habits of throat-cutting. From
our Consuls at Ragusa, Cettigne, and Belgrade, and even at Phillipopolis and
Adrianople, the Government may have received "no accounts in which these
details are mentioned," and yet the details may be in the main true. It seems
strange that the Daily Xews * "Own Correspondent" should be so much more
fully informed than our own Government's! But all England must wish, with
Punch, that the most cold-drawn account may prove the truest.
Great fight on going into Committee on Education Bill between the Secularists
and Nonconformists, under the lead of ME. RICHARD, and the supporters of the
Government Bill of all shades of moderate opinion.
ME. RICHARD, under cover of his Amendment declaring compulsion unjust till
all elementary schools are under public management, moved up his big guns,
double-shotted with all the grievances of the Nonconformists, social and theo-
logical, as well as educational. Briskly answered by the batteries of HUBBABJ),
GKEKNK, PAGET, HALT,, COWPER-TEMPLE, and GENEEAL THE MARQUIS OF
HAHTINGTON, against the cross-fire of JENKINS, MORLEY, MACARTHUH, MUNDELLA,
and WADDY, the Nonconformist artillery was finally silenced, and victory
declared for the Government by a decisive division of 317 to 99.
With a conscience-clause to protect the Nonconformists, and with MR.
FORSTER'S Amendment enforcing a report to the Educational Department of all
coses of its infringement, Punch cannot but think the religious difficulty—so far
as it is not political—fairly provided for; and is compelled to believe that the
division represents the opinion of the country, as at present advised. As national
and not denominational representative of the British Public, he docs not feel
called upon to find fault with it.
Tuesday (Lords).—Second Reading of Poor Law Amendment Bill,—a more
useful than showy measure, giving much needed powers for the cutting and
carving of Unions, and bringing us a long step nearer the end of settlement, by
making paupers irrcmoveable after three years' residence.
(Commons.)—Morning Sitting. In Committee on Education Bill. LORD
SANDON shrinks from making education between five and ten compulsory, but
does not shrink from prohibiting the employment of
children between ten and fourteen, unless they pass the
gate of the three R's, or can prove five years continuous
school attendances of 250 days a year. In other words,
if parents have failed in educating their children under
ten, the children shall be debarred from earning a liveli-
hood between ten and fourteen!
This is punishing the children for the parents' laches
with a vengeance. Common sense says No to such an
unreasonable and unworkable proposition. LORD F.
CAVEXDISH has mitigated its absurdity by his amend-
ment—which the Government has had the sense to accept
—exempting from the prohibition half-timers under the
Factory Acts or children in necessary and beneficial
employment attending school under the bye-laws of a
local authority.
In the Evening Sitting LORD F. HEEVEY moved the
expediency of legislating for the improvement of the
La was to the qualifications and appointment of Coroners,
and the conduct of Inquests. "Crowner's 'Quest Law"
has been a subject of ridicule since the Grave-digger in
1111 in let gave his famous illustration of it. It has
received many a striking illustration since. But the
last straw that broke the Crowner's back has been laid on
by a recent miscarriage of justice in a Crowner's hands
which will occur to all minds, though LORD F. HERTEY
thought it better not to mention it.
Oh, the much enduring Conservatism of England,
which has preserved with little change and less im-
provement a machinery for investigating cases of sudden
death, invented, if tradition can be trusted, in the time of
ALFRED THE GREAT! The first notice in relation to the
('oroner's office LORD HERVEY had found was a case in
which that wise monarch had hanged a Judge for treat-
ing the verdict of a Coroner's Inquest as conclusive.
The indictment was in many counts, but all may be
taken as proven. The only question is, whether the
office should be reformed or abolished, to make room for
a new and completer instrument of inquiry. Even MR.
READ, chosen representative of the stable bucolic mind,
was for going this length; and though'MR. CEOSS would
retain the name, he is ready to alter election, qualifica-
tions, and other conditions so completely that the Coroner's
office, after CRO.SS has sat upon it, promises to be like the
Irishman's knife, that was the same knife after it had
been fitted with a new haft and new blades, or SIR JOHN
CUTLER'S famous stockings, whose identity was insisted
upon after the original material had disappeared under
repeated darnings.
Has a First Lord of the Admiraltyan ex-officio place
in all Naval Messes? MR. WARD HUNT seems disposed
to assert such a right. In the Naval Mess of to-night the
House was within twelve of leaving him. The Admiralty
is often accused of being " pound-foolish," but in the case
of CHAPLAIN PENNY r. CAPTAIN SULLIVAN, very effectively
but fairly stated by MR. K. ASHLEY, it cannot, be allowed
the usual correlative merit of being "penny-wise."
Why had not MR. RICHARD CAPTAIN SULLIVAN'S case
for use on Monday night, in his summary of the wrongs
of the Nonconformist:1 For CAPTAIN SULLIYAN is
a Nonconformist Captain, on whom the Admiralty
had cruelly, and no doubt of malice aforethought,
quartered one Prann", the highest of High Church
Chaplains. Pent up in a ship, Nonconformity and
High Church must explode, as inevitably as hydro-
gen and oxygen in a close vessel on passage of the
spark from a Leyden jar. And when they did,
and the RF.VEREXD PENNY had taken every oppor-
tunity of showing that he didn't care a farthing for
CAPTAIN SULLIVAN, and insisted on wearing crosses
on his stole (which the Captain characteristically
complained of as "not uniform,") and on chanting,
and holding long services in the teeth of the Naval
regulations, and in treading on the Captain's theo-
logical corns in his sermons, the Admiralty removed
the Captain from his ship, and meant to remove the
Chaplain, but didn't—by an accident—and has since
refused the Captain a court-martial, MR. WAXD 11 TNT
contending that though the matter was serious enough
for dismissal of a Captain, it was altogether below the
dignity of a court-martial. Yet it was strictly an affair
between combatant officers, a Captain on the one side,
and an officer of the Church Militant on the other.
The House gave MR. WARD HUNT a tolerably intel-
ligible intimation of their opinions by a division of 91 to
103; every naval officer who spoke having spoken in

condemnation of the Admiralty. If anything can be trusted to
teach MB. WARD HUNT " not to do it again," this should.
Wednesday.—Liquor was in the ascendant. Had it been a vote
for the introduction of "cups " into the House, Punch would have
felt more sympathy. The Government, in spite of the heart-stir-
ring eloquence of the Major, has knocked under to ME. SMYTH, and
^ranted a Second Heading of his Bill for the closing of Irish public-
houses on a Sunday, in accordance with the Kesolution which MR.
SMYTH carried some short time back. MR. GLADSTONE supported
the Second Heading, on the pka of legislating in accordance with
Irish ideas. But is this an Irish idea i Is it not rather the idea of
a eertaia minority of active Irish enthusiasts, under knowing
priestly influence'?
Then the Sitting was talked out on the Scotch Intoxicating Liquor
Hill, for transferring the holding of licences from those sinners, the
publicans, to the municipalities of towns above a certain population,
on the Swedish system. Punch would gladly see the experiment
tried, though he doubts its success in the liquorish land ayont the
Tweed.
Mfc. MARTEN opposed the Bill on the doubtful plea that drunken-
ness hag nothing to do with the number of public-houses.
The Government opposed, and the Lord Advocate, of course, did
not see his way to the experiment.
MB. ORH Kwnr», maintaining the original thesis that "Scotland
was not a bit drnnkener country than England, but that Scotchmen
took their drink in a form that made them lively, Englishmen in a
way that made them stupid," talked the Bill out of a sweltering
House, which all this talk about drink must have influenced to the
thirstiest pitch.
(Meanwhile the Teetotallers were triumphing on pop and ginger

enthusiasm was imperfectly tempered with the cold-water ot

ease. _Mi. WARD HUNT admitted that the Captain's half-pay had
been diminished, owing to his removal from his ship (or "dismissal"
was it? Punch begs MR. WARD HUNT'S pardon, but he can't, for
the life of him, remember the difference), and thaf CHAPLAIN
PENNY had been in private correspondence with a Lord of the
Admiralty during his ritualistic squabble with his Captain. The case
seems to grow more fishy the more it is looked into.
In Committee on Education Bill, vain attempts at indirect com-
pulsion. Little Hodges and Gileses are to be excused from school
for six weeks for hopping and harvest work, and other light and airy
agricultural employments, where time is, as the lawyers say, "of
the essence" of the crop.
POSIES FOR THE POOE.
THE DUKE and DUCHESS OP WESTMINSTER might lind something
else to do with their wealth than distributing any of it among suc-
cessful competitors in a Children's Flower-Show, like that held in
the Gardens of Grosvenor House the other Monday afternoon, when,
m a tent on the lawn, between thirty and forty little florists, the
eldest aged only fifteen, received prizes in money from the hands of
the Duchess herself, with the not unnecessary admonition " to be
sure and not lose it." It would be quite possible for their Graces—
as ME. GLADSTONE, seconding a vote of thanks to them moved by
LORD SHAFTESBURY, observed—"to shxit their eyes to the wants
around them, to shut their ears to the cries for help, and to live for
themselves alone."
But every one to his liking, and if persons of rank and riches
derive any gratification from contributing to the happiness of others,
great or small, why they pay their money for that purpose, and thev
take their choice. As the Right Honourable orator already quoted
pointed out—
"To go back in our history no long time—a century—we reached a period
when every human being was in reach of the country; now every one at this
time had the advantage of parks and squares; but London now covered sack
a spaco that many persons were being gradually removed from contact with
Xature. The value of it was apparent from the eagerness with which it was
pursued. In the manufacturing districts, however, where for miles and miles
there was no'hing but dirt and smoke, and where the products of toil covered
the whole face of Nature, and changed the very appearance of the people,
there wus no opportunity of enjoyment in parks and gardens. So much the
more important was it then that the cultivation of flowers should be encou-
raged by window and house gardens. The need was increasing, and the
opportunity he hoped would be improved."
Another way in which they may lay out money to the same effect
as in providing poor people with refreshment for their eyes and
spirits in the shape of window and house gardens, is by subscribing
liberally to the funds of the Comnuras Preservation Society for legal
resistance to the attempts at enclosing common lands, made by Lords
of Manors accustomed to shut their eyes to the wants around them
and "live," as MR. GLADSTONE said, "for themselves alone"—like
too many gentlemen of " propputty " whom it were easy but invidious
to name.

We came in at the death with a rush, my boys.
The Fox at our feet lay low;
And we cut off the Fox's brush, my boys;
To the hounds did the rest of him throw.
And they hauled him to and fro,
And didn't they tear him, O!

see for themselves. But potatoes with tongues are a purely native
growth of Ireland. The existence of such a variety of the tuber
only shows how widely the gift of eloquence is diffused in the Green
Isle. The very pratees can talk, and should be called "praters."

"D'YE mind me, a sailor should be, every inch,
All as one as a piece of his ship.
And with her brave the world, without offering to flinch,
From the moment the anchor's a-trip."
So chaunted CHARLES DIBDIN, Tyrtseus of old,
To England's invincible Navy,
When ship's bread crawled with weevils, and flowered in blue
mould,
And Mids ate their junk without gravy.
When at evens or odds JOKNNT CRAPAro.as oft
Was licked as he dared cross our track:
When NELSON made heroes, and glory aloft
For hard lines below paid poor JACK.
Then our beautiful craft on their white canvas wings
Like frigate-birds skimmed the wide ocean;
None would dream there was harm in the exquisite things,
Fair at rest and still fairer in motion.
Till out spoke their broadsides, and laid gun to gun,
Looked yard-arm to yard-arm, they 'd show
British tars could do aught British tars e'er had done,
And would sink e'er they struck to a foe.
Our iron-clads now all that beauty have doffed,
And like tea-kettles smoke, big and black;
No clean lines a-low, and no white sails aloft,
To ravish the eyes of Poor JACK!
Still JACK sticks to his Captain, and still says his prayers—
As men will, in short heave of Death's grapplin;
Though little for High Church and Low Church he cares,
High or Low Church, a Chaplain's a Chaplain.
As a Captain his ship has to sail and to fight,
So a Chaplain's to preach and to pray;
But when Captain and Chaplain get thwart hawse outright,
Poor JACK doesn't know what to say.
Whether Chaplain's been cheeky, or Captain has scoffed,
Either way the ship's taken aback;
"Small good then the ohaunting, a-low or aloft—
Not a Pennyworth !" grumbles poor JACK.
"To rancour unknown, to no passion a slave,
Nor unmanly, nor mean, nor a railer,
He's gentle as mercy, as fortitude brave—
And this is a true English sailor."
So sang DIBDIN, and bard against chaplain, his strain
Might well teach the man-of-war parson,
That to set Roman candles ablaze on the main,
Is sheer theological arson.
When Captain and Chaplain at loggerheads oft
O'er the book at each other look black,
A Penny a-low ain't a farthing aloft
In walley received by Poor JACK.

"Ah!" he exclaims, heartily. "Come in! I was just going;
and" (looking at his watch) <r I haven't more than yes" (he
likes to be exact) "I \ejust ten minewts to spare. Come in!"
[I cannot help making a note, which will be useful in Typical
Developments under the head of "P" (Pronunciation). A Cock-
ney—in _ fact, most Englishmen—would pronounce "minutes" as
'min-nits," but an Irishman sets us right, and gives the "u" its
value: he says " min-netots."
Subsequent Note (after making this remark to a Friend].—An
Englishman makes a distinction between "minutes of time," which
he pronounces " min-nits," and " minutes of proceedings •written in
a book," which he pronounces "min-newts." What does an Irish-
man do? How does an Irishman make the distinction? . . . .
N.B.—To ask an Irishman this question. Nothing like going to the
fountain-head.

ought to be registered. Why isn't there an Office for the registra-
tion of Ideas? Not only one Office, because that would be com-
paratively useless; as, for example, if the Office were in London,
and I were at the Giant's Causeway, or in the Hebrides, and sud-
denly had an idea which I wanted to register sur le champ, it would
be an absurd expense to have to come up to London merely to
register the one idea. No; erery Post-Qmce should be empowered
by Act of Parliament to be also an Ideal Registration Office.
Think this out, and make it a condition of my giving my vote
at the next Election that my candidate shall pledge himself to
do bis best to bring in an Ideal Registration Office Bill. Or why
not go in for Parliament myself with this idea, and make it a party
cry P]
TIM MAHONT, who has been speaking to a couple of friends of his
in the Club while I have been making this note in the porch, turns
to me, and says, "Let me introduce you to JACK BOWLER, my
cousin. You 've often heard me mention him to you."
I bow, and smile politely. This is intended to give them to
understand that I have so frequently heard of JACK BOWLER from
Tnr MAHONT, that to meet him is the realisation of the highest
aspiration of my life. Really, I mean (to myself) "I don't remem-
ber TIM 's ever having said anything about him!
We bow, and smile. So far is easy; but what are you to say to a
new acquaintance suddenly introduced after you 've finished bowing
and smiling? In a novel you will find the novelist airily saying.
"After the first civilities had been interchanged, Gfiistave observed
to his new acquaintance," &c., &c., and they are in "two-two's"
in the middle of an intimate conversation which, of course, has some
bearing on the main plot. But that's the want in an ordinary case.
There is no plot.
Yes, there is. This is not an ordinary ease. I have a plot. I
have come to ask Tm about Ireland. I tell them this, whereupon
they laugh. Once begin, after an introduction, with a laugh, and
the fortune of the conversation is made. A laugh in time saves nine
minutes of twaddle.
"WTiy, TIM," says BOWLER, "you've never been to Ireland in
your life, have you?"
"Never since I was born there," replies TIM: then adds, warmly,
turning to me, "And so you 're going to the old country? Ah! I
wish I could go ninth ye."
"Do! "I say.
"Ah! I can't, "he replies, shaking his head—"I'm so busy in town.
I 've got such a lot to do, and I 've promised TOFFHAM—ye know
SIR JOHN TOFFHAM ?—No t Ah! ye 'a like him—he's a good fellow.
An' he's got such a place down at Pemby! It's Liberty Hall—ye
can do just what ye like there. I must be with him to-morrow.
Could you put it off for a week or two?"
"Yes," I answer, "if you would be certain to come with me."
He meditates for a few seconds; then, as if he had arranged
everything for the next fortnight, he says,
"No, I can't promise: I mustn't disappoint TOFFHAM. Why
don't you come down with us? There are a lot of fellows you know
going.'"
"Yes," I object, "but I don't know SIB JOHN TOFFHAIC."
TIM MAHONT sees no sort of difficulty in this. "What's that
matter?" he asks. "I '11 invite you, and you '11 go down with
me."
I tell him I have made up my mind to go to Ireland at on'ce, -and
shall be very much obliged if he will give me any hints as to routes,
best places to go to, hotels, and perhaps a letter or two of intro-
duction.
"I can do something for you," he says: then, to his cousin,
"JACK, aren't you goin to take a' brandy-and-soda f"
He wasn't going to, but he will.
"I thought you said you were," says: TIM, beckoning to the
waiter: and then to me, Ye '11 take something?''
For company's sake, and as a matter of curiosity, never 'having
met TIM in his own Club before.
His cousin asks me if I would prefer anything to the usual
brandy-and-soda. This I take to be a civil hint to Tm that not
everybody cares about that common but useful compound.
We are served in silence, and I notice that BOWXER pays.
Having paid, he retires, saying he '11 be back presently, but if not,
&c., &c.
"Good fellow, JACK BOWLER," says Tra, when he has left. "If
he hadn't been engaged to-night, I 'd have got him -to hove dined
here."
"I didn't know," I say, foreseeing an invitation to the Loungers
for to-night, "you were a member here."
"I*m not," he replies. "Me cousin BOWLER is; and what's the
use of our both belonging to the same Club? Ah, they know me
here; an' it 'sjust the same as if it were my own."
TIM MAHONT can't assist me. He's not certain that he knows any
(which he pronounces " annie ") fellows in Dublin now. "'T'ud be
no use me givingye a lot of letters of introduction, and; then to find
nobody there. T'ud be wasting yer time." he says.
He is right. In these circumstances I 'd better try elsewhere. I
say " Good-bye!" to him.
"Ye '11 write to me," says he at parting, "an' let me know where
ye are. I 'd like to join ye, if I can."
"Do!" I urge."
"I will."
So we take leave of one another pro tern. He no more intends
joining me in Ireland than I mean going to Australia.

,
the meeting, and it ought, by this time, to be above
HE last time Mr. Punch visited the Volunteer
Camp which divides the beauties of Wimbledon
from the glories of Putney, he regretted that he
was not provided with a Boyton dress. Last
summer the rain it rained every day, and the
rifle contest very nearly assumed the appearance of a military regatta. The weather
was pleaded as an excuse for many a shortcoming. LIEUTENANT , SMITH, of the
217th Administration Battalion of Diddlesex Rifles, pointed to the rain as a reason
for appearing in a neat uniform, composed of regimental overalls, an old yellow
shooting coat, a straw hat, and an umbrella. And PMTATE JONES, of the same
gallant corps, wore quite as picturesque a costume as his smart and soldier-like
superior officer. This was a year ago, when JupiterPluvius was out of temper. In 1876 the scene has changed. Instead of constant rain
there is only too much sunshine. Tie sun it snineth every day. and raises mirages that would spoil any snooting but that of the crack
shots of Wimbledon fame. The weather, at least, can no longer be given as an excuse for slovenliness.
"I suppose I must go," said Mr. Punch. It is the seventeenth year"of
criticism.
"It ought to be, Master," replied Toby, "but it isn't. You take my word for.it, if you'don't keep a sharp look out upon those
Volunteers they will degenerate into a military rabble."
"They behaved very well before the Prince at Hyde Park, Toby."
"Anybody can march past, Master—that's not a very difficult task," retorted the cynical Dog. "But look at the Volunteers at
home, and then judge of them. If they are not abroad at Wimbledon—well, I will diet myself upon cat's-meat for a fortnight."
You have been taking lessons from ME. HOLMS. Toby."
"No. I have not, Master," growled Toby. "I hate inaccuracy, and, hating it, don't care very much about the Representative of
Military Reform and—Hackney! Take my advice, Master, go to Wimbledon."
Thus urged, Mr. Punch started for the Camp. As he walked through the lines of the canvas town, he jotted down a few notes.
The stroll was long and wearisome, but he managed to collect some materials. When he returned to Fleet Street he was tired out. The
Dog of Dogs moved an easy chair towards him.
"Sit down, Master," said Toby, "and tell me what you think about our friends the Volunteers."
"You can read for yourself," replied the exhausted Sage, throwing over a bundle of MS. to his faithful and sagacious dependent.
"Hum," murmured Toby. "Fair in the main, but requiring additions. I will prepare them for the press."
And Toby did. The following is the result of the preparation :—
Uniform of the Volunteers.—Rather better than usual. A large majority of the men appear in proper costume. Unhappily,
Mr. Punch has to report several glaring cases of eccentricity. He noticed one individual in a scarlet tunic, plaid trousers, and a wide-
awake! Apparently the Volunteers consider that a large white handkerchief may cover (like Charity) a multitude of sins. Under
this snowy headgear Mr. Punch recognised hats of all shapes and materials, from the modest pepper-and-salt helmet up to the lordly
Lincoln and Bennett. But, after all, shooting is the important point. As his friend Sis WILFRID LAWSON has observed, "Cannot
a man fight as well in a shooting-jacket as in anything else?" (Note by Toby.—This is not the point. The Volunteers at Wimble-
don are supposed to be soldiers. Soldiers should be smart and disciplined. A man in a costume which is suggestive of a military
beggar who has lost part of his uniform, and had that part supplied from a civilian wardrobe by the charity of the public, can be neither
smart nor disciplined.)
Of the Tents.—Mr. Punch is pleased to find that on the whole the encampment has been formed with judgment and care. At
noon, on the day of his visit, the tents looked clean and tidy. He was particularly pleased with the Regimental Camps, which were
comfortable without being luxurious. Of these he may particularly single out the encampment of the London Rifle Brigade, which was
(as usual), all that it should be. The battalion is commanded by COLONEL HAYTEH. Mr. Punch feels sure that none of the comrades
of this gallant officer will wish him " to go to Bath"—except at the time of a general election. The flowers outside several of the tents
were exceedingly pretty, and everything would have been perfect had trenches in all cases been dug round the tent pegs. (Note by
Toby.—Who wants a lot of flowers in an encampment! It would serve the Volunteers right were the rain to fall for a fortnight.
They would then learn the value of proper drainage. No trenches indeed!)
Concerning the Luxury of the Staff.—Mr. Punch had always been under the impression that the Regulars' chief objection to the
Volunteers has been this—that they (toe Volunteers) have been either too silly or too proud to follow the very excellent example set
for them by the rest of the Service. Under these circumstances, Mr. Punch confidently expected to find the tents of the Staff models

of simplicity and utility. On his way to the cottage, Mr, Punch had occasion to notice that
the tents of the Volunteers (officers and men) were n«at and comfortable. A waterproof
sheet, a woshhand-stand, a bed, a looking-glass, a lantern, and a tub, generally composed
the inventory. When he reached the quarters of the Staff, the spirit of his dream changed.
Over field-ameers' tents he read the names of subalterns who had evidently done their very
best to bring the specialite of London to the common of Wimbledon. These field-officers'
tents (occupied by subalterns) were boarded and carpeted. They looked more like the shops
of cabinet-makers than the canvas homes of warriors used to the discomforts of the tented
field. In front of these field-officers' quarters were flowers in great abundance, and the
whole encampment (with the showy mess-room and the lazy-looking marquee) gave
Mr. Punch the idea that if there were any "feather-bed soldiers" in the enclosure, he
(Mr. Punch) knew where to find them. (Note by Toby.—A very unfair attack.; The
Staff are most excellent persons. They have several things to do—at least, so it is
reported.)
Of the Organisation of the Camp.—In spite of the luxuriance of the quarters of the
Stafi, Mr. Punch begs to bear his testimony to the excellent offices provided for the officials.
Instead of the old tent, which was such an eye-sore last year, a neat wooden building
appears, in which clerks and others are busily engaged the live-long day. It is only fair to
state that the tents of the Camp Commandant, the Camp Adjutant, and the Secretary, do
not belong to the gorgeous division. (Note by Toby.—This paragraph requires no addition.
CAPTAIN MILDMAY is to be congratulated upon his good sense and good management.)
Concerning the Shooting.—The small-bore men as usual loimging about in absurd costumes
and giving themselves airs. The regular Wimbledon marksmen much smarter in appearance
than usual. Mr. Punch, however, must call attention to the antics of an acrobat in a wide-
awake, who assumed a ridiculous position whenever he fired a shot.
When Toby had got thus far in his work, Mr. Punch stopped him.
"Master, 1 am not half done," said the sagacious dog, "I havejiot abused the Volunteers
nearly enough."
"Stop, my friend," replied Mr. Punch.
"The Volunteers are a very useful body of
men. They have one or two faults that
can be easily corrected, and no one has a
right to show them ill will. They have on
the whole behaved admirably at Wimbledon
this year."
"And is that all yon have to say?"
"That is all I have to say," repeated
Mr. Punch, "except this," and then the
great man raised a glass of claret cnp to his
lips, "May the Volunteers live long and
prosper!" "And" (as a future historian
will relate in 1976) "they did!"

WHO IS TO BLAME?
Or, Roman Tactics anil Anglican Strategics.
"As long ae certain members of the Church of England are in the habit of
imitating the Roman devotion of celebrating Mass, invoking the Saints, and
Confession, reciting the rosary, and the like, conversions will follow, which,
sudden as they may appear, are but the necessary consequence of such a line
of conduct."—Mu. BOWDEN'S letter to the Times on the "Perversion o/LoRD
NELSON'S son."
WHO 's to blame for the 'Vert? Well, each rival Divine
May esteem himself clever at " drawing the line."
But Kubicons narrow are apt to be crossed
By adventurous feet, or by spirits doubt-tossed.
If you lead a horse down to the stream's very brink,
You need scarce be surprised should the animal drink.
"/ Romeward inclined f" cries the Anglican Priest.
""Pis the slander of bigotry!—Not in the least!
Mimic Mass? Mariolatry r Oral Confession!'
Pooh! pooh! Our own Creed's exoteric expression.
No nibbling1 at Rome's toasted cheese, oh, dear no!
But those Protestant' fogies got sleepy and slow;
Their decoys ceased to draw, and, lest worse should befall,
Our Church-trap we 've baited afresh—that is all!
They who shout' stolen garments!' are spiteful or dull, for
Here 'a nothing whatever that sniffs of Rome's Sulphur."
And yet still they stray, these young lambs, from your flock,
At the sound of the pastoral pipe you but mock.
Just a soft tootle-tootle, and over they go,
For the slope is so easy, the hedge is so low,
'Tis a jump scarcely felt, and—undreamt-of disaster!—
The little pet lambkins have found a new Pastor.
Whose the fault? Punch opines that the Anglican priest,
When the blame is apportioned deserves,—not the least.'
The descent to Avernus is easy they say,
And you won't make it harder by "paving the way."
Lead your flock three parts down and then bid them halt there ?—
Just as well bid the bullet stop short in mid air;—
Show the needle the magnet, but ask it henceforth
To point just a leetle away from the North;
Roll the Sisyphus Stone from the brow of the hill,
But request it to halt half way down, if it will,—
And then ask the 'Vert, long rolled Romeward, to stop
In your house of half measures, your second-hand shop,
Where doctrines " conveyed," and " maimed rites " but proclaim
Its provisional nature, and ultimate aim.
"Roman tactics," forsooth! It were better to fix
More attention on Anglican strategy's tricka.
Rome-and-water 's a tap" some may deem very sweet,
But young sippers may try how the liquor tastes neat.
If perchance they prefer it. pray who is to blame,
But the men who first taught them the taste of the same?
Small need has shy Rome for unmasking her battery,
While sleek Imitation, the subtlest of flattery,
Sneaks into the garrison, drills each defender,
And so paves the way for a willing surrender.
Men may turn, and return,—but while Spirit and flesh hold
You '11 nnd few contented to "dwell on the threshold!"
The Last Servian "Shave."
THE l)aili/ Telegraph of the Sth instant published the tidings that
the Servians "had captured three Kouhlas and shaved them.' The
original telegram ran in French:—
"Les Serbes ont pris trois Kouhlas et les ont rases.''
As " Kouhlah" means a "blockhouse," it is probable that the
rendering "rased to the ground" would have been preferable to
"shaved." The word " rusts "certainly has both meanings, and it
may be that, considering the whackers generally telegraphed by
both sides from the Seat of War, "shave " was thought to be a safe
translation.

POOE PRISONERS \
SHOBTLY after eleven o'clock, a few nights sfaloe', a large meeting
of the Predatory Classes was held in one of the most frequented
itreets in London, to consider the new Prisons' Act. A gentleman
mown as " The Lawyer," but whose registered name did not trans-
pire, was elected to the Chair by acclamation.
The' CHAIRMAN said that he must congratulate the Meeting upon
e admirable site they had secured for a gathering-place. They
were standing in a street in which goods of the utmost value were
itored. So thov might feel sure that they had no reason to fear a visit
from the police. ("Hear, hear!") He was proud to say that
London was one of the worst guarded cities in the world. (Cheers.)
5e must claim their indulgence, however, to beg that they would
lot take advantage of their position to steal anything. They were
iere for pleasure—not for business. (" Hear, hear ! ") It would
manifestly be unfair to those employed in holding the Meeting were
;he non-speakers to seize the opportunity of their confreres' aosence
x> do a stroke of work on their own account. ( Hear!") As
Englishmen ho reminded them of the national motto—" Honour
among thieves." (Loud cheers.) And now he would call upon his
distinguished friend, ME. WILLIAM SIXES, to move the first Resolu-
ion. As his honourable (or should he gay "dishonourable " P)
—(Laughter)—friend had not devoted much time fp literature, per-
haps he (the Chairman) had better r'ead the KeMntfen himself.
It was as follows :—" That this Meeting, composed of some of the
hardest-working persons in the community, regard with distrusl
any scheme for the alteration of the Prison System now in force.
They moreover consider that the proposed Bill (to quote the words
of the LORD MAYOR OF LONDON) 'directly interferes with the liberty
of the people, and looks more like the Bill of a Continental Power
than of our HOME SECRETARY.'"
MR. WILLIAM SIKES (who was very well received) said he didn't know
much about talking. He had certainly made speeches before now al
the Old Bailey, but they were always the same, and had only two
words—" Not Guilty." (Laughter.) And when he made those
speeches, they were always failures, because the jury never believed
him. (Laughter.) But here, as he had been brought up before
them, he might as well say his say. He was proud to assert that he
belonged to the criminal classes ofjthe country, and he thought
those classes had a right to claim self-government. (" Hear, hear ! "]
Those classes made more money change hands than any other classes.
(" Hear.') Then why should they not be heard? (" Hear, hear.'")
This new-fangled Bill was un-English—it was unconstitutional.
(Cheers.) If it was passed, the prisons would be all alike. And
he knew the Government. They were a stingy set. (" Hear, hear ! ")
Once, after a very good thing, he was weak enough to send the
CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER half a ten-pound note for unpaid
Income-tai; but when he heard how they were cutting down every-
thing, how they proposed to take all the prisons and reduce the diet
probably to the diet of barracks and workhouses—(" Shame.'")—he
kept the other half of his ten-pound note, and used it for lighting
his pipe. (Cheers.) They might rest assured that if the Govern-
ment got hold of the dear old gaols, they would make them all as
bad as Salford-^ffroaHs)—where a man got more work and much
less food than in London, for the prisons provided by the City
authorities were simply first-chop. (Cheers.) He begged to propose
the Resolution that had just been read by his venerable and learned
friend "the Lawyer." (Loud cheers.)
MR. RICHARD DE SWTNDLER begged to "second the Resolution
He was not quite Tsure that he had a right to call himself a
thief. He was a prompter of Bubble Companies. (" Yes, yes.'") He
thanked them for their cordial acceptation of his claims. He quite
agreed with MR. SIKES that they had a right to be iheard. The
Predatory Classes were one of the most important powers in the
country. He saw before him the practical part of those classes, the
men whose energy and courage stimulated industry everywhere. If
nothing were stolen the various markets would be glutted, and labour
would come to a stand-still. (" Hear, hear.'") But they had brothers
in other walks of life. Surely the adulterating tradesman, the
penniless spendthrift, and the fraudulent trustee might claim
dndred with them. ("Hear, hear.'") The Predatory Classes
were the cause of the employment of a number of very helpless
and witless men, who, but for them, would be probably starving in the
streets. He alluded to the Police. (" Hear, hear.'") He claimed
'or the Predatory Classes the right of self-incarceration. An
Englishman .boasted that his house was his castle; it surely was most
unreasonable to take from him the right he had enjoyed from the
earliest times—the right to chose his own prison. (Enthusiastic
cheering /)
The Resolution was then put to the Meeting, and^carried unani-
mously.
Ms. FAOIIT, junior, said that although not actively engaged in the
>rofession, he considered, as the receiver of stolen property, he was
is good a thief as any gentleman present, and he thought they ought
to be very grateful to the Municipal Authorities who were opposing
he new Bill. (" Hear, hear.'") He begged to move " That the
hanks of this Meeting are due to the Mayors, Aldermen, Vestrymen,
tnd other friends'.who are resisting the encroachment of Government
ivranny—tyranny which would deprive the rich swindler of his
irison clerkship, and the poor thief of his customary Christmas fare."
"Hear, hear ! >')
The Artful Dodger (who was received with applause) begged to
econd the Resolution. He thought as things were getting now-a-
!ays so very bad any move back in the right direction should be
ncouraged ("Hear, hear.'") The gentlemen who were opposing
he Prisons Bill were certainly doing the Predatory Classes a great
ervice. (Cheers.) He was not surprised. Some time since he
ead a speech delivered in the House of Commons upon the Cor-
porations of England. It convinced him that many of the Municipal
flicersbelonged to their own profession. (Cheers.) He was pleased
x> find this kindly fellow-feeling existing between the bench and
he dock, and he sincerely hoped it might continue for ever. (Loud
•heersj
The Resolution was put to the'Meeting and carried unanimously,
s also was a complimentary vote of thanks to the Chairman.
Before the company separated two Policemen joined the gathering,
'he constables subsequently reported to their inspector that in the
rowd they were deprived 01 their staves, their pocket-handkerchiefs,
heir watches, and their lanterns. They did not discover the losses
hey had sustained until the following morning.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

UNCH, LORD DERBY, and LORD GBANTILLE being of one m'ni en
any point, England may safely be of that mind too.
ENGLAND having for twenty years accepted the Declaration ratified
by "the judgment of Paris"—that "free ships make free goods"—
declines (Lords, Monday, July 17), by the voice of LOBD GRANVTLLE,
as well as LORD DERBY, to go back from that Declaration. Herein
the Lords follow the Commons, who have just shown, by a No-
House, their disinclination to disturb the new doctrine.
LORD DERBY thinks that our disavowal of it just now would lead Europe to infer that England was refurbishing an ancient weapon of
offence in apprehension of impending war. "Quieta non movers " should be the motto of the moment.
LOBD GHANVTLLE goes further. He thinks the new doctrine the best for England under any circumstances. Suppose JOHN BTOL
neutral, the new principle gives him the carrying trade of the belligerents. Suppose him belligerent, it leaves him his trade with
neutrals, while its abrogation would enlist every maritime power against him. This sounds well, though a very different way of
looking at the matter. For the present. England, at all events, lays aside a weapon that she has used of old'with deadly effect
on her enemies, but which, like all deadly weapons, is capable of being turned against herself. One thing should plead for her with

enlightened self-interest.

LORD SALISBURY. What examinations are meant to pick out, is not the ready-made tool for India, but the best raw material.
Competitive examination, LORD SALISBURY quite admits, has its bad points j but think (he adds) of the blessing it is to heads of depart-
ments !—it doubles their power of obliging with nominations, and shunts influential incapables, patronage notwithstanding. We shall
yet see the system maintained, not because it secures the best servants, but because it saves chiefs trouble.

Besides these two talks, their Lordships did a heavy stroke of
work, knocking off, at Peers' pace, some dozen Committees and
Third Headings by half-past seven; their bag including such various
game as Wild Fowl Preservation, Poor-Law Amendment, and
Labourers' Dwellings.
(Commons.)—Personal. LORD HENRY LENNOX resigns the First
Commissionership of Works to cry peccavi for his Stock Exchange
sins of five years ago, as Director of the Lisbon Tramways Company.
LORD COLERIDGE'S summing up in Twycross v. Grant made LORD
HENRY'S appearance in the white sheet inevitable. MR. TREVEL-
YAN had but to give notice that he meant to ask a question, and
LORD HENRY'S resignation answered it by anticipation. His explana-
tion was received by the House with sympathy—but in silence
broken only by a few painful words from MR. DISRAELI. The PRE-
MIER'S long-standing and close personal intimacy with LORD HENRY
gave a touch of pathos to their parting. LORD HEXRY has shown
himself the right man in the right place as First Commissioner of
Works, whatever he majr have been as Director of Lisbon Tramways.
The House feels for him—but there is still one place where ill-
gotten gain has a bad smell—that is on the hands of a Minister, when
once attention has been called to it. LORD HENRY points out that
he has been a loser by his connection with the Lisbon Tramways. In
that the public goes along with him. The difficulty would seem to be
to say who has not lost by that remarkable enterprise. Even the
modern Midas, ourAluertus Magnus, the great Alchemic transmuter
of the day. who turns all schemes to gold, may find reason to doubt if
his power be not fated to come to grief at Lisbon Tramways, should the
other eighty-eight pending actions follow the test-case of Twycross.
From Lisbon trims, through Lisbon's DUKE SALDANHA,
Once on Director's heads fell golden manna,
Till Rings and Rigs and puffs no premiums earn,
And Lisbon tram-shares into trammels turn.
Sharp-set Directors fasting teeth must crunch hard,
And fain clerk's head, in UKANT'S default, would punch hard.
GRANT falls to JAMES'S powder. LENNOX, low,
From London's Works for Lisbon's works must go.
Alas that he this lesson should hare wanted,
Qualifications never take for granted!
MR. DISRAELI did his best to soften the story of Turkish atrocities
in Bulgaria. He read SIR HENRY ELLIOT'S despatches. SIR HENIIY,
as in official duty bound, does his best to extenuate everything, and
set down nothing in malice, except the motives of unofficial reporters.
He is bold in paring down figures, and shifts the burden of provoca-
tion from Turks to Christians.
Bashi-Bazouks and Circassians have had to bear a great deal
before they took the law into their own hands. No wonder their
hands may have been a ketle rough. Then, though there was not so
very much to remonstrate against, Sra HEXRY has been diligent in
remonstrating. And though there has not been much serious atrocity
to check, the Tiirks have now sent a Commissioner to check it.
Altogether, all seems for the best in that best of all possible F,m-
bassies at Stamboul. At all events, now that those troublesome
Correspondents have said their say, and poor DISRAELI has done his
best to soften the Daily Neirs picture of horrors by help of SIR
H. ELLIOT'S sweetener and official milk-and-water colours, the
country has both sides of the, Turkish shield—the black and the
white—before it, and may come to its own conclusions. SIR HENSY
says the Christians are volunteering for service against the Servians.
So that besides a regiment of Spf tas, with yataghans in one hand
and Korans in the other, we are like to see a mixed Volunteer corps,
with Cross and Crescent, side by side, upon their banners.
In Committee on Education Bill, last clauses reached, amid cheers
from both sides of the House.
For though the Bill your Brummagem Intransigents stand off,
The House with gladness SANDON helps polemics' arid sand off.
And in hope the Bill's improvements may be seen in Acts succeeding,
Joins to doat it to the haven, deep and tranquil, of Third Heading!
Tuesday (Lords).—A talk on Provisional Orders—nothing about
the bill of fare in the refreshment-rooms, or what their Lordships
are pleased to order in the way of refreshment, but the machinery
by which Town, School, and Harbour improvements are now
legalised—a compromise between doing such work by Bill in Private
Bill Committee and by officers of permanent departments.

old LOBHLOLLT BnoT, the native Indian Admiral, as jovial an old
fellow as ever you met on Saturday night at sea in an old caboose,
would never allow a muscle of his face to move, even at my most
telling witticisms. No; so strong was the habit that he 'd just turn
to his Smylah (the Indian name for these officials, who are the pro-
fessional laughing-men, i.e., Les Hommes quirirent), gravely nod,
and off would go the Smylah into fits and shouts. When old
LOBULOLLT thought he had laughed enough, another movement of
the head stopped him. I pitied the poor Smylah when he had a
bad headache (it was often the case; he was a bilious man. but a
good laugher), and some one told the LOBHLOLLY a nautical joke \
The jolly old Indian Tar would make the Smylah laugh for an hour
at a stretch at that one joke. Good, dear, kind old^boy as the old
Indian ADITIRAL LOBHLOLLT was, yet, if that unhappy Smylah had
pleaded biliousness as an excuse for not shaking his sides with
laughter, then " Off with his head—so much for Smylah .' " would
have been the Admiral's^order, which would have been executed on
the spot,—in fact, the'order and the Smylah would have been
executed together.

DOGS AND DOCTORS.
MR. PUNCH had yesterday the honour of receiving a numerous
eputation, formed chiefly of the higher orders, and largely consist-
ig of the softer sex, friends of animals, especially of dogs. It was
^aded by a beautiful being, who, in a voice of angelic sweetness,
gnifted the object of their attendance in the following appeal:—
"Will not Punch, the great master of Toby, 'best of dogs,' use
is mighty influence for the benefit of Toby's brothers and sisters'?
Till he not raise his voice and wield his pen to rescue them from
le horrors of Vivisection? For the love of mercy, and for the sake
t gratitude to these faithful loving creatures, Pray do!"
Mr. Punch replied, with an obeisance expressive of the most
;spectful admiration, that he was profoundly moved by the impas-
oned exhortation addressed to him from lips associated with eyes
idiating sweetness and light. He would, however beg to be
llowed to depute the duty of responding to it to the party it prin-
ipally concerned.
"Toby.'" cried Mr. Punch, and the sagacious animal imme-
iately came out from under the table. "Toby, now's your time."
"The Dog-Days, Master?" was Toby's prompt reply.
"0, Toby! But, true enough, clogs are in season. They are at
resent creating a special interest. You just now overheard a
)uching and eloquent appeal on behalf of them. Now be so good
s to explain to these Ladies and Gentlemen—who know you can
ilk—your view of Vivisection as affecting your own community,
'ell them, Toby!"
Having duly shaken himself and wagged his tail—
Toby said that both personally and as a representative dog he felt
jispeakably grateful for the benevolent sympathy so deeply
rounded by the Vivisection supposed to be cruelly practised by
)octors on Dogs. The subjects of that process, however, were not
lis brothers and sisters. No good dogs were ever vivisected. Those
hat were so were very distant relations indeed; curs, the canine ana-
ogues of cads. Every dog must die somewhen and somehow. A cur
might die worse than by Vivisection under chloroform. The vivi-
sected cur died for the benefit of man—the Dog's friend. He therefore
did not die a useless cur. He (Toby) computed that some twenty
dogs died yearly by Vivisection in England. If Vivisection were
abolished, a great many more than that number would so die abroad
at schools of science necessarily resorted to by British students and
investigators, and would most likely die without chloroform. The
pain, if any, inflicted upon dogs by scientific vivisectors was as
nothing to the amount of torture dogs had to endure at the hands of
ignorant people. Many thousands died a lingering death, the victims
of cruel fondness, crammed to death by stupidly-indulgent masters
and mistresses, particularly the latter. Innumerable dogs were
tortured by cruel boys, and owners who ill-treated them. A friend
of his (Toby's) Master's was often kept awake all night by a dog
that howls as frightfully as he possibly could if he were being vivi-
sected. An inhuman wretch keeps this unhappy dog tied up. The
trainers of Performing Dogs, in teaching them tricks, subjected
them to the grossest barbarities. Against all these torments, involv-
ing myriads of dogs, there was no set-off whatsoever in the shape
of good to either dog or man. Whereas the operations of the vivi-
sector enabled him to solve problems affecting brutes as well as
human beings, and to discover secrets, of which the knowledge
applied in Medicine and Surgery—veterinary as well as human—
relieved or rescued from the most poignant agonies both men and
dogs too. He (Toby) understood that an Honourable Gentleman had
said as much as that he should be sorrv to owe his life, or his relief
from suffering, to an experiment in Vivisection. Was he not in-
debted to Vivisection, or worse, for all his animal food? How could
he bear to eat his beef, his mutton, his veal and ham—especially
veal and ham, for were not both calves and pigs bled slowly to
death by Vivisection? Without anesthetics, mind. He (Toby)
wondered if that Honourable Gentleman ever tasted the eel that
had been skinned or the lobster that had been boiled alive. And oh,
could the dear lady who had so earnestly implored the rescue of the
canine species from " the horrors of Vivisection," considering what
massacre the tender little woolly innocents undergo at the hands of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE SILENT HOUR!
"WHEN SHALL YOU COME HOME, MUMMY DARLING?"
"NOT TILL THE MIDDLE OF THE NIOHT, MY LOVE!"
"KOT TILL THE MIDDLE OF THE NlGUTl—WHEN THE CLOCKS STRIKE KOTHIHO?"
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
Stopping on the Way—But Going to Ireland for all that.
TIM MATONY has failed me : it occurs to me to give up Ireland altogether.
I am meditating on this while debating on the question of lunching at a restaurant's close at
hand, when to me enters—the only other Irishman of my acquaintance at present in town.
He replies to my intimation about going to Ireland, with, "Arrh! yersowl! wouldn't I like
to be wid ye !" which he gives with a marvellous imitation of some peculiar Irish dialect, and
then relapsing into the most ordinary English, without the slightest suspicion of a brogue, he
informs me that though he has property in Ireland, he doesn't like to live over there, for
fear of being shot at. I assure him (not knowing anything at all about it) that they (who-
-™- "they" may be) wouldn't shoot at Aim. Whereupon he adopts the brogue again—(I
ever

him that while
'the story of the Agent writing over to the Landlord in England, and telling
collecting the rents he was going in bodily fear of his life?"
Sappy Thought.—As I can't absolutely
assert that I do not know this story—
because I never yet met him without nis
bringing it in, somehow—I say, "Go on!
YOU've always got something good." Which
is true; as this story is good: and he has
always got this story. Q. E. D.
He goes on, still continuing his imitation
of a brogue :—
"Well, Sorr, the Landlord wrote back to
him, and said, 'My dear MISTHEB DELA-
ITEY. ye may just tell my tenanthry, that
if, by shooting you, they think they'll
intimidate me, they're mightily mis-
taken.'"
And taking advantage of my laugh, my
friend, FORDE MACKINNON, shakes my hand,
wishes me ban rot/age, steps into a hansom,
and makes a telling exit.
When he is well out of sight, it occurs to
me that I ought to have asked him for in-
troductions, or for some information about
Ireland.
Happy Thought.—To compile a book of
What I Ought to have Said.
This leads to melancholy reflections. It
means lost opportunities. (I stand by a
lamp-post near the large restaurant's, and
think in a mooning kind of way, having
wandered away from Ireland altogether—)
If when I was with ALICE—or KATE—or
BERTHA . . . (what a pretty girl that is
coming out of the restaurant) ... I had
only said what I.ought to have said, instead
of sitting still, staring ... (I wonder if
I 've met her before—I seem to know her
face) . . . and losing my presence of mind
. . . (She seems to recognise me. She is
very pretty. I rather fancy she is a cousin
of mine whom I haven't seen for years . . .)
Happy Thought.—To go up and ask her
if she is a cousin of mine whom I haven't
seen for years.
. . . Let me see—what opportunities—
yes, that was what I was thinking about
. . . (I am sure I notice [in her a family
resemblance . . . about the eyes. . . She
is going to cross, and it is dangerous for a
Lady to attempt crossing alone. She hesi-
tates. If I could be of any assistance—
hesitate. It's a very warm day. I wish I
had bought a new pair ot gloves. I fancy
my boots, too, are defective.). . . Ah! . . .
Odd! I am sighing . . . what does this
mean? It would make ra subject for an
Essay "On Unexplained Sighs — their
Origin and Probable Meaning". . . (She
looks round as though she were afraid of
crossing alone, and were expecting some
one—me?—to help her. . . . Heavens!
what an unchivalric age we live in! . .) it is
a very warm dav . . . yet I regret not
having on light gloves, bright boots, and a
new hat. . .
Again she looks round, nervously, be-
seechingly ... I wonder if she is a cousin?
. . . ShaU I nourish my stick, wave back
the cabs, carts, and omnibuses, and take
her under my protection across the road
. . . Shall I? . . . One can never lose by
politeness—and this is the merest elementary
duty ... I settle myself, as it were, to my
work. . . Take a pull at my gloves, arrange
my hat (which has somehow got to the back
of my head), give a gymnastic dig at my tie
(which has somehow "rucked up"), and
make one step towards . . .
"I 'm sorry you so long vaiting to have
keep," says a light-haired, fluffy-looking
man, of apparently German extraction,
stepping out of the restaurant's. (How
on earth such a pretty English girl could
have chosen such a plain, stupid-looking
foreigner—with blue spectacles, too! . . .
But one never can have any sympathy with
the man on these occasions) . . . and she

seems pleased to see him, and smiles. ... (I do not think she is a
cousin of mine . . .) Let me see, what was the subject of my
meditation when this distraction intervened? . . .
"Hullo!" cries a jovial voice, which is accompanied by a hearty
sl*p on my back—so hearty, in fact, that it nearly precipitates me
into the gutter—"what's the matter with you? You look as
melancholy as if you were manufacturing a joke, or had just swal-
lowed a doubtful oyster.
It is my amiable musical friend, KEPPBII BIBKETT, who is speak-
ing. The German and the Young Lady have not yet crossed: she
overhears KEPPEL (I am sure of it), and is amused.
"I haven't seen you for an age," KEPPEL continues most heartily.
"Why, you're getting quite stout." (That's the worst of people
who profess "not to have seen you for an age"—the} Invariably

turn my back on them both contemptuously.)
KEPPEL is still going on, laughingly, to me,—
"Well, we're getting old together. Everyone's getting old—at
least, everyone's about the same age now. We 're all getting stout
and grey and bald. Ha! ha! ha! Come in and lunch."
With "pleasure. Bnt I can't stop long, I tell him, because I want
to go and find some one who can tell me all about Ireland.
"All about Ireland!" exclaims KBPPEL. opening his eyes.
"Why, you've come to the right person. And are yoB going to the
dear old country?"
"I am," I reply; "but why do you call it the dear old country?"
"Because," he answers, "I'm so fond of it."
"Bnt," I object, "you 're not an Irishman, and you don't live in
Ireland?"
"No," he says, "I live in Wales, and I'm a Scotchman. But
what of that? Wasn't St. Patrick himself a Scotchman? Of course.
Come in and have lunch, and I '11 tell you all about it."
ILappy Thought.—Met a Scotchman, who lives in Wales, who
calls Ireland the "dear old country," and who will tell me "all
about it." If I hadn't stood on the kerb by the lamp-post, lost in
thought about what I ought to have said on various occasions, the

on me dreadful, them
Radicals, drabbit their

Jest because I invoked our
Sweet Prince in a way as
was kind and polite.
As I own I 'd been drinking
his health, bless his heart,
in good gunpowder green,
And a Germany Band, jest
below, was a playing up
"God Save the Queen."
Which, what with the tea
and the time, and the

I felt so warmed up that
my pen like a prose-
spurning Peggysus flew,
And promiscusly dropped
into poetry—ah! and jest
wasn t it fine?

Xo, when I does pile it up lofty, P. COUHT isn't nowhcres, my dear;
But the way as they chivies yourSAlBEY is shameful, as well you're
aweer,
Which loyalty isn't their line, and in course they dislikes it in me,
But their nasty mean wenomous malice shan't make a sour Dilke
of S. G.
Which "shudder" I did, and no wonder, as where's the lone
woman would not?

At the thought of that dear plucky Prince being swallered or
pisoned or shot;
Which thousands of bullets and daggers, and millions of tigers and
snakes,
Is things they may laugh at as likes, but they gives your friend
SAIBBY the shakes.
"When I 'eafd he was goifig to Ingy among them black barbarous
hordes,
The fright as it giv' me was seeh as is not to be put into words.
And oh! when I read of his prowess — sweet Palading! — sticking
them pigs,
Why aspings is not to be mentioned for shivers, nor likeways
(Whieh earwigs, my dear, as yon know, always gives me the
shudders that bad I)
Bnt when he got back to his "younglings" (that's "kids," dear)
jest wasn't I glad?
Afld because, while u-gazing with awe on the face of our Sun and
our hope,
I bust into song, the Ilads cheeks me, a-singing out " Treacle!"
and "Soap!"
Soap, indeed! Drat their imperent spite! which they wants it
theirselves, for the sands
They would onlv be ' appy to lift ' gainst my Prince, as I quite
understands.
But the "Presence " and " Prowess " that braved, as it might be, a
"Zoo "all let loose,
Won't take fright at the bray of a donkey, nor pale at the ' iss of a
goose.
Consequentially why should I care for their wulgar and wenomous
jeers,
Concerning my words on the Prince, and the Fleet, and them sweet
Volunteers.
Which adjectives fails, MRS. ARRIS, and poetry-werses is weak,
To express what I felt in my ' art, and so warmly endeavoured
to speak.
Bnt IthinkI'ma littlebit low, — which my BENJAMIN isn't too kind, —
As is why, dear, I now writes to you. Won't I give 'em a bit of
my mind?
Bnt if only my Gingham may cover my Prince like Akilles's shield,
Why the wounds as them wipers as left in my bussum will quickly
be ' ealed.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

EAVILY hang pains and pleasures;
Would that Parliament were dumb!
Slowly drag the Session's measures,
Or to Fate succumb.
Yet neither House has heard a solider night's talk than that of
the Lords (Monday, July 24), in which three lights, or ex-lights, of
the Foreign Office were turned on to the question of Extradition,
now darkened with much dispatching, under the Treaty at present
unhappily suspended between JOHN and JONATHAN.
The question lies in a nutshell. Is JOHN—having caught one of JONATHAN'S gaol-birds, and handed Viim over to JONATHAN under
terms of an Extradition Treaty, on such evidence as would warrant his committal for trial here—bound to bind JONATHAN over not to
try his gaol-bird-in-hand, now he kas got him, on any but the charge on which JOHN handed him over ?" Yes," maintains LORD
DERBY. "No," argues SECRETARY FISH. And LORDS GBANVTLLE, EJMBERLEY, HAMOND, COLERIDGE, and GREY—great lights, diplo-
matic and legal—say something very like ditto to MR. FISH. So does Punch, under stress of common sense as well as argument.
First catch your rogue; but leave the Cooks at home to dress him. The right of political sanctuary once secured, every rogue arrested
is a good riddance 01 bad rubbish to be thankful for, and there an end.
BRITANNIA does not bear her tcgis to shelter gaol-birds. The sooner the rogue-net is re-set between JOHN and JONATHAN the better.
LORD DERBY must feel by this time that he has been needlessly solicitous about rascaldom. "Give and take" should be the standing
rule between us and our American Cousin in all things, most of all in the case of each other's law-breakers. BRITANNIA keeps a
political, not a criminal, asylum. That must be a bad construction of law or treaty which turns the one into the other. The restoration
of the criminal-catcher is henceforth only a question of time and terms. The sooner MR. PIERREPOINT and LORD DERBY set about it
the better. While honest men remain fallen out, thieves are coming by what is not their own. Who knows but the theft of the
"Duchess " may be due to the suspended Extradition Treaty?
(Commons.)—MR. E. JENKINS, having asked MR. DISRAELI an ill-judged question, MR. DISRAELI gave MR. E. JFNKTNS an uncivil
answer. Both are to be regretted, but MR. DISRAELI ought to have known better. His reputation for courtesy and good breeding is
worth more than the turning of the laugh against MR. E. JENKINS.
On Education Bill—another night added to the two already wasted in stirring the fires of polemic strife with PELL'S poker.
"Your Clause I don't like, MR. FELL, , LORD SANDON'S Bill was going well
The reason why I 'm free to tell: ! Till your Clause marred it, Ma. PBLL."
VOL. LZXI. p

[AUGUST 5, 1876.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PELL asks powers to dissolve School-Boards by local vote. The
Government has, ill-advisedly, accepted the clause; and avowed its
preference for Voluntary over Compulsory Educational Machinery,
for Schools over School-Boards, for the system as it "was before
1870 to the system 1870 established. Now, apart from the merits
of the matter in dispute, there is nothing England dislikes and
distrusts so much as harking back in legislation. "Litera scripts
manet" and " Vestigia nulla retrorsum" are among her favourite
mottoes. Even when she doubts the wisdom of the step taken, she
feels there may be more mischief in retracing than in sticking to
it. Much more when she has no such doubt. 1870 settled too many
burning questions, to have their ashes now relighted by the Pellian
firebrand. Unluckily, LORD SANDON has thrust that incendiary
instrument into his Bill, and thereby wasted a week, set the Opposi-
tion in a blaze, and brought about two explosions of Ma. BBIGIIT'S
Nonconformist dynamite, which, dangerous at all times, seems
fraught with ten-fold power in the present state of the weather. As
if the House hadn't been hot enough for the last fortnight, without
these smouldering fires of Church and Dissent being blown up again!
LORD SANDON seems to have seen his error, and to have done all
he could to allay the conflagration, by such wet blankets as MH.
DODSON'S Amendment (that there should be no dissolution of a
School-Board without the sanction of the Education Department),
and so forth. rBut, the spark had been set to the dry wood. BRIGHT
blazed forth. A. MILLS kindled his Church Beacon on the other side.
The Fiery Cross was sent round to summon the champions of the
Church. SIB JOHN KENNAWAY and MR. STORER struck into the melee
to the slogan of "Church-School and Catechism"; while LOWE and
PLAYFAIH, MUNDELLA and DODSON, BBISTOWE and JAMES, JACOB
BRIGHT and WHALLET, charged to the cry of " School-Board and no
Creeds."
"Aurora prcclium diremit."—The House rising at ten minutes to
three, after one of the hottest nights of the season in every sense.
"Que (liable allait-il faire dans cette Pell-ere.'"
Tuesday (Commons}.—Morning Sitting. The fire kindled by the
pestilent Pell-Clause still raging.
MR. FORSTER moved to exempt from the operation of the clause
School-Boards compulsorily formed.
Hot passages of arms between MR. MUNDELLA and LORD SANDOH,
and LORD SANDON and the veteran ROEBUCK.
LORD SANDON accepted an amendment requiring a vote of three-
fourths of the ratepayers for dissolution.
MB. SHAW LEFEVBE moved to limit application for dissolution to
within three months of the expiry of School-Boards, that is, to once
in threeyears.
The Chairman left the Chair at seven. The super-heated House
had not cooled down for the transaction of business by nine, and
was Counted Out.
The waste of that night, too, may be scored to PELL.
Wednesday.—Two Bills for Second Reading. One a Burial Place
Bill of MB. TALBOT'S, which had, with singular infelicity, combined
in opposition the paladins of Church and Chapel, BKUESFORD HOPE
and OSBORNE MORGAN, the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and
MR. RAMSAY ; the other a bold Bill of MB. E. ASHLEY'S, for allowing
accused persons to give evidence in their own cases, which MR. ROD-
WELL described as a return to the dark ages—but which seems to
Punch to tend in the direction of more light rather than more
darkness.
MB. SERJEANT SIMON, SIB T. CHAMBERS, MR. KNATCHBULL Hu-
GESSEN, SIR E. WILMOT, and the ATTORNF.Y-GENEBAI, united in
opposing MB. ASHLEY'S innovation. RECORDER RUSSELL GOBNEY
was equally emphatic, and, as it seems to Punch, more reasonable,
in.recommending it. Lawyers differ as yet. The time may come
when the weight of even legal opinion shall be as decidedly on MB.
ASHLEY'S side as it now seems against him. And yet if there were
a " balance of opinion," as there is. nominally at least, a " balance
of power," query, which of Wednesday's testimonies—that for
MB. ASHLEY, or those against him—would kick the beam?
Thursday (Lords).—The only thing that occurs to us, in the
present state of the weather, is that the "Nullum Temptts Bill "—
whatever that may be—went through Third Reading in no time.
(Commons.)—SIR H. WOLFF asked the PRIME MINISTER whether
he had reason to think the Servian plans had .failed, and that the
time had come for a Congress on the Eastern Question?
MB. DrsKAET.T, not knowing what the Servian plans were, could
not say if they had failed. As for the rest of the question, the
Eastern Question was about to be discussed in the House, and he
ra>uld prefer to keep his powder for that.
After a desultory talk about the business, the' Bills blocked, and
the questions hung up—MR. DISRAELI declaring he would and could
settle nothing till the Education Bill was got out of the way; and
a laugh raised by a fervent wish of MR. WARD HUNT'S, in answer to
an interrogatory from MR. GOSCHEN, that he saw his way to the end
either of the Session or of the inquiry into the explosion aboard the
Thunderer—the House went again into the Education row, pell-mell.
I,nun SANDON showed his readiness to take advantage of all the
buffers offered him, by accepting MR. SHAW LEFETRE'S Amendment
of Wednesday.
Then MB. BRIGHT made the most furious onslaught this Session has
seen on the Bill and the Church Party, reopening every old Non-
conformist raw, and pouring oil of vitriol on the stormy waters of
the Debate. He moved that whenever a School-Board was dissolved,
the local authority shall have all its Powers under the Act of 1870.
LORD SANDON declined to introduce new elements of polemic strife
into Boards of Guardians and Town Councils, but showed good taste
in declining to take up any of the shower of gauntlets flung down
by MR. BRIGHT.
At last, after a hot fire pro and con., Ma. BBIGHT'S Amendment
was rejected by 120 to 63, and MR. PELL'S Amendment was voted
part of the Bill by 122 to 81. LORD SANDIJN'S dwindling majorities
should teach him and his prompters what the more sensible section
of his supporters think of the policy of reopening closed strifes.
The same lesson was read to MR. HALL—who tried to enforce pro-
vision by School-Boards for the religious instruction of children
if their parents desire it, and as they desire it—by a Division of 190
to 96. But the House has not yet reached the end of the Bill; and
till it is got rid of, no other business can be done. And here we
are within a fortnight of the Parliamentary Last Day!
Friday (Commons).—Morning Sitting for Education fight. Great
cry, and little wool. The House agreed to sit on Saturday, to clear
the road for the Eastern Question on Monday.
Discussion of the riots in Barbadoes. GOVERNOR HENESSEY
acquitted of aught worse than indiscretion in promising too much
good from Confederation. On the whole, the Governor comes out
of the mess with less discredit than the planters.

July 25.
IT is officially
announced that the
Turkish Armv, un-
derBuNKUM PASHA,
have achieved a
glorious victory
over the Servians
in'. the neighbour-
hood of Tchsntiza.
The Servians, who
were under the com-
mand of GENERAL
VVWZTKS, num-
bered 40,000, and
had twenty cannon. After a long day's fight, in which the Turks
accomplished prodigies of valour, the Servians wore compelled to
evacuate all their positions. They left 20,000 dead on the field,
15,000 of them were taken prisoners, and the rest of the 40,000
are now in full flight. BUNKUM PASHA took eighty cannon, and
is confident of capturing the remainder. The Turkish loss is but
slight; and it is generally considered that the war is virtually over.
(From Our Special Correspondent.)
RAGUSA, July 28.
COLONEL Xxmsinvi is marchinfr on Scutsloklics. This is im-
portant, and may be decisive. The movement is creating much
excitement.
[ (From Our Special Correspondent.)
BELGRADF., July 29.
I MENTIONED in my last telegram that a great battle had been
fought, and I am now in a position to give you all particulars. On
July 26th the Servians, 5000 strong, under GENERAL VVWZTKS,
attacked the strong position which the Turks held at Tchsntiza.
After two days' incessant fighting, the fortunes of war inclined to

VlZNNA, ./'//.'/ 30.
You must not believe any telegrams sent yon from Belgrade, or
indeed from any place except here. The stories about sanguinary
engagements are all false. AB a matter of fact there has T>een no
fighting at aH yet. Rely upon me, as soon as there is a battle, to
send you full and truthful particulars.
(From Our Special Correspondent.)
ODESSA., July 29.
G-ENERAL KuhLIT/ has been recalled. Owing to the deplorable
ignorance of the natives of this town, I am at present unable to tell
you who the General is, -where he has been recalled from, why he
has been recalled, who has recalled him, aiid what is going to be
done to him.
(From Our Special Correspondent.)
BERLIN, July 31.
BERLIN is the only place -where any trustworthy information can
be obtained from the seat of war. Constantinople, in particular, is
u hart-bed of lies. There has been much severe lighting, but with
no important results. Rely upon me for early news.
(From Our Special Correspondent.)
CONSTANTINOPLE, August 1.
Tin Turks have won another great victory. This is official.
Hopes are loudly expressed here that your Correspondent at Belgrade
may hare been hanged.

THE Servians have totally defeated the Turkish army. There
was much rejoicing here last night when it was announced that your
Constantinople Correspondent had been shot.

There has been more severe fighting. TMs in true.

PUNCH OFFICE, August I.
( 'HM i: home at once. I can't understand a word of what you arc
sending me. You contradict each other all round, and I canT make
oat your names, places, or dates. I believe you are all at Margate.
But wherever you arc, you had better come home. Roly upon one

HOW TO KEEP COOL IN HOT WEATHER.
NEVER read a notice of your last
novel written by an Anonymous
Friend, or, if you are warm you
will become warmer.
Take no notice of any number of
cords from those "very particular
people," Ms. and MBS. PERCY PLAN-
TAGENEI BiiiTH, and forget all about
their last invitation
to a "small and
early." Greet them
afterwards from
the knife-board of
an omnibus, and
you will find their
reception of your
salutation remark-
ably cool even for
August.
On no account
have a carte de
tisite taken of vour-
self for the girl of
your heart. Anx-
iety and a thing
screwed tightly
into the back of
your head during
the process, will
rapidly raise your blood to something like fever heat.
Don t be led into a discussion about the Eastern Question with an
Irishman who can see no difference between the cruelties of the
Turks in Bulgaria, and the brutalities of the English in the Emerald
Isle.
Don't argue about the Mobilisation Scheme with a Militia Sub-
altern, the construction of Ironclads with a Recruit belonging to the
Royal Naval Artillery Volunteers, and the Prisons Bill with a
Deputy-Lieutenant of this year's appointment.

MOBILISATION.
"Epur non muove."
THZ publication of the following opinions anent the "Mobilisation
Experiment" requires no apology.
Lieut.-General Sir Stock JDunaerhed, G.C.B. (Ensign's Commis-
sion dated 1817).— Stuff and nonsense, Sir! Bringing a lot of men
together, Sir—what for. Sir, what for? To show 'em where to go
in case of an invasion! Stuff and nonsense, Sir! In case of an
invasion the proper place for the British Army, Sir, would be in
front of the Enemy. English Soldiers don't want to be taught that,
•Sir! The march of science, indeed! Stuff and nonsense. Sir, what
we did sixty years ago, we can do again, Sir. The Duke, Sir,
never wanted a Mobilisation scheme, Sir, nor do I. And now pass
the port, Sir.
Major-General Sir Blottyng Paper, K. C.B. (of the Intelligence
Department, W. O.).—A perfect success, reflecting the greatest credit
upon everybody concerned. I feel sure that were our shores to be
invaded we now could put every man in his proper place in com-
paratively no time. AIT we should want would be a few more horses,
a few more men, and the means of transport. I consider that my
Department has honestly earned the hearty praise it is waiting to
i receive. The work has been something enormous, ever since we
received instructions (in the Spring) about the proposed proceedings.
After the late-experiment I may say that in the event of a descent
upon our shores being attempted, we could get Infantry, Cavalry,
and Reserves, into their appointed district, with six months' notice
from the Enemy.
| Colonel Martin Henry (of the Regulars).—May do the men some
good. Gets them under canvas, and accustoms them to travelling in
heavy marching order. Awful bore for the Officers—double duty
and a had mess. On the whole, can't exactly see what harm it can
do; on the other hand,can't find out what's the good of it. Well.
j it' amuses the War Office and the Public, and doesn't hurt us, and
so we needn't complain. And now, Mr. President, shall we go into
the ante-room?
Colonel Browne Bess (of the Militia).—The worst thing in the
world, Sir, for us. Whenever they take us from our head-quarters,
our recruiting is thrown back for years. The men learn nothing.
Remember we are only out twenty-seven days. Allow for three
Sundays, four half-holidays, two days for giving out the clothing,
two days for paying off and taking the uniforms into store, the
inspection, and say three wet days, and the twenty-seven are reduced
to a miserable fortnight. We want every hour of those fourteen
days, and "the Mobilisation Experiment" robs us of nearly all of
them. It's a great pity, Sir, they don't leave us alone.
Trooper Wurzel (of the Yeomanry).—Ha! ha! ha! As if we were
going to take pur horses to be half starved and quite worked to
death. We said we wouldn't go, and didn't. The " Experiment"
has only proved that where there's a will there1 isn't a way. Mo-
bilisation won't move us. Ha! ha! ha!
Captain Lounge (of the —th Hussars, Clubs. Rag, Junior, Naval
and Military, and the Saleigh).—Not quite the thing, you know,
for a noble sportsman. Taking a lot of warriors away from town in
the height of the season, and sticking them in a horrid hole without
food and water, is scarcely the way to promote chirpiness. Tell
you what, old man, if they try it on again, I shall send in my
papers, and go in for a flutter in the wine-trade. Waiter! A split
brandy-and-soda and the cigar-box.
Lieutenant Head (Head in the Ciril Service Examination).—I
have considered the matter very carefully, and have commenced a
pamphlet upon the subject, which would have been finished by this
time had I not been ordered a.course of position-drill by my com-
manding officer.
Messrs. Counter and Till (Tradesmen, Horsham, also at Chelten-
ham).—A very good idea, indeed. But mind you, it's not a bit of
good if you knock the Soldiers about. Let them get well accustomed
to any two places. You 've begun with Horsham and Cheltenham.
Then stick to Horsham and Cheltenham. Not that we are interested
in the matter. When all's said and done, our takings during the
Experiment wasn't much more than about five times as much as
usual.
Mr. Punch (Adviser-General to the British Public, Greatest Sage
of this or any other Age, Src., fyc., fyc., fyc., #c.).—For a first
attempt not so very bad. No transport and far too much notice. To
sum up, the Mobilisation of the Army would have been eminently
successful if the Soldiers had only been able—to move!

A GENERIC DIFFERENCE.
First ScJioolgirl (Sweet EigTitccn). "I AX so TIRKD OF WALKING ALONG BY Twos AND Twos ix THIS WAY! IT 's AS BAD AS THE
ANIMALS GOINU INTO THE AKK!"
Second Ditto (ditto ditto). " WORSE I HALF OF THEM WERE MASCULINE!"
HINTS ON DIET DURING HOT WEATHER.
(Comjiikd from Various Aitiltorities in the Medical Press.).
Dtranro the prevalence of hot weather:—
1. Meat should be eschewed.
2. Fish should be looked upon with suspicion, if not dispensed
with altogether.
3. Poultry contains but little nourishment, decomposes rapidly,
and cannot be recommended.
4. For health, Tinned Provisions are out of the question.
5. The excessive fermentation of Bread in hot weather renders it
indigestible and unwholesome.
G. The sometimes fatal effect of stale Vegetables, and the diffi-
culty inexperienced cooks have in detecting the stale condition,
render the use of Green Vegetables, particularly, extremely risky.
7. Fruit, unless at first hand, is so much poison.
8. Pastry of all kinds impedes the digestion, and throws the
internal machinery out of gear.
9. Recent revelations with regard to Milk will caution all persons
against its use, even when direct from the Cow that imbibes sewage
water. The same remark may apply to Butter.
10. Pilchards and Sardines contain so much doubtful oil of their
own, and that which surrounds them is too often so doubtful also,
that it is impossible to advise their use.
11. Many a constitution has been sacrificed to Made Dishes.
12. Of Eggs, unless laid on the premises, the less said the better.
And now with regard to drinks and stimulants in hot weather :—
1. Those who drink adulterated Tea. Coffee, &c., know the risks
they run. No stomach can stand them long at any time.
2. Two-thirds of the trash known as "Aerated Waters" contain
nothing but a little impure gas pumped into impure water.
3. Ordinary Water should undergo two or three processes before
it is fit to drink.
•1. With regard to Ice, it is to be feared that a large proportion of
it is derived from horse-ponds.
5. Wines within the reach of ordinary incomes only have the
effect of over-heating the system, and producing lamentable results.
6. Weak Whiskey-and-water might be recommended, were it not
for the deadly fusil oil contained in most Whiskeys.
7. To drink the best Pale Brandy implies the miUlonnaire. Among
Brandies of the ordinary class, Brown Brandy has been considered
least, but only least, injurious.
8. Gin is always debilitating, and sometimes actually poisonous.
It is Mr. Punch's painful duty to inform the Public that, as a
consequence of compiling the above "Hints," Mr. Punch's Nervous
Contributor has been endeavouring to sustain life on Brown Brandy
and Bloaters. The result is scarcely satisfactory.
VERY SERIOUS SHAMMING.
WHAT have ME. RourLrDOF. and MR. BOOTH to say to this (from
the Yorkshire Post of July 21) ?—
"A DYING PRISONER REFUSED MEDICAL AID.—At the Borough Court
on Wednesday—before MR. J. ROUTLIDGE and MR. W. BOOTH—a poor,
dejected-looking creature, who gave the name of PATRICK DALY, ana de-
scribed himself as being a bricklayer, was charged with having been found
drunk in the Market Place at Pontefract, on the night of Tuesday. The poor
fellow was apparently suffering great pain, and begged the Bench to allow
him to be taken into the Union House and seen by a Doctor. This request,
which was orer and over again asked at the hands of the Bench, was disre-
garded. • • • As he was being removed in a sinking condition from the
court the same request was most pitiably made, but the poor man was informed
he could see a Doctor on reaching Wakefield. He was conveyed there, and
while proceeding through the streets he died at the feet of the police-officer who
had apprehended him, and was conveying him to the House of Correction."
The promise of the Bench will not be broken. Poor PAT DALY
has seen a Doctor—or rather a Doctor has seen him—at Wakefield,
for post-mortem examination.

'THE LIAR BIRD."
RECBSTLT OBSERVED ix GREAT NUMBERS AT THE SEAT OF WAR.
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
On the Way to Ireland—Lunch—Information—A Genuine Start,
or very near it.
"WVlunch—KEPPEL BIRKETT, and myself. BIRKETT is enthu-
siastic about Ireland. "Ah!" he exclaims, "the dear old
country! I envy you. I wish I were going with you."
I press him to come. He considers before replying; then he asks
me the day of the month; then he frowns, and appears to be
"thinking it out." Presently he shakes his head, and says, regret-
fully, "I "m afraid I can't."
KKPPEL BIRKETT never says "No " decidedly. I do not believe
that "No" is in his vocabulary. As a rule, he means " No," bul
he doesn't like to say it all at once. My belief about KEPPEL is, thai
•were I to meet him, and say, " My dear KEPPEL, I 'm off to Tim-
buctoo to-morrow," he would immediately reply, "Timbuctoo!
dear old Timbuctoo!" (Happy Thought.—What a beautiful name
for an Irishman—TIM BUCKTOO! Note this under the letter "N"—
Nomenclature—for Typical Developments, Vol. , Book , Chap. .
And then he would probably go on to say, "Ah! many's the
pleasant day I've had in Timbuctoo!" Whereupon he would (1
am sure) be eloquently silent for a few moments, while his manner
generally would lead his hearers to imagine that he was recalling
euch romantic details of his life in Timbuctoo as it would beabreacl
of confidence on his part to mention, even to his dearest friend. If ]
then changed the scheme, and observed, "I beg your pardon—1
didn't mean Timbuctoo, I meant Japan—I 'm off to Japan to-morrow,'
he would be sure, after a pause, to reply, with quite another ex-
pression of countenance, conveying the idea that his reminiscences
connected with Japan had rather more of a comic than a romantic
•ide,—" Ah! dear old Japan! Ah! "—with a laugh, as though, i:~
he bked, he could tell me something, about his personal adventure;
in Japan, that would amuse me intensely,—" Ah! Japan! It's a
charming place, if you only get hold of the right people.^ You mus
know the MEKADO—a dear old boy—and old HAND* YOKO, who'
immense fun—full of anecdote!" Then he would fall into a re
verie, waiting to be drawn out by a process of further questioning.
However, it not being a question of Timbuctoo or Japan, but o
Ireland, he confines himself to the subject in hand. He can't go
limself, but he can give all the information, and the introduc-
ions, which will be of the greatest possible service to me. He has all
orts of out-of-the-way things for me to do; and I listen eagerly.
"What line of country shall 1 take?" I ask, note-book in hand,
and expecting to be furnished with a detailed plan of travel, which
ihall include lakes, mountains, waterfalls, wonderful rocks, &c.
"Well," he says, "I '11 tell you. You mustn't miss a breakfast
it the Zoo—near the monkey-house. Charming! Such a set of
good fellows! Such wit! such stories! such—• "here, being quite
it a loss for words to express his admiration of these Zoological
Tellowg, he finishes by nodding at me heartily, exclaiming, "Ah!
Quite a thing to see!
I note down "Monkey-house "—" Breakfast"—" Zoo "—" Fel-
aws!!" and he proceeds :—
"Then you must go up to the Monastery in the Hills"
I note do wn " Monastery in the Hills," and ask him'' What name ?''
He doesn't remember the name at that moment, but he "11 give me
an introduction to some of the members of the Club—" the best
'ellows in the world!" —(all KEPPEL'S friends are " the best fellows
n the world! ") "And," he continues, " you'll have a real treat.
STou '11 meet the Doctor, and CRUMP—d'ye know CRUMP? He's a
?arson—ah! you must know Aim—full pi songs and the raciest sto-
ries! You mustn't expect anything big in the way of dinner ; you '11
only get roast and boiled there: and the Monks do it. It's grand!"
<rTo what Order," I abk, "do these Monks belong?"
I am deeply interested, for it sounds mediaeval and picturesque;
only, I never heard of an Order of "Cooking Monks, who served
I!lub dinners for the delectation of a Doctor and a singing Parson.
He doesn't remember exactly to what Order. "But," he goes on,
there they are in the grounds, in their grey or brown habits—
quite takes you back to the old days." He says this as if he had a
distinct and vivid recollection of the 'old days,' and deeply regretted
;hem; implying thereby that his premiere jeunesse must have been
about four hundred, years ago. You'll have," he continues, "a
irst-rate dinner; first-rate conversation, songs and whiskey after-
wards—such song*!—such whiskey!"—and KEPPEL lifts up his
eyes to Heaven, as though in grateful remembrance of a sip of
nectar, and smacks his lips. Then he returns to earth—" and a
drive home on a car!—hrst-rate! There are only two Monks left
now—dear old boys!"
Only two Monks left! I suppose the work for the Club was too
much for them; but I note down, " Two Monks," " In the Hills,"
"Dinner," "Drive Home." Then I ask him, "What else?" as
this, though delightful as far as it goes, doesn't seem to me to
absolutely exhaust a visit to Ireland.
He considers. "Ah!" he exclaims, as if suddenly recalling
scenes of the brightest description, "You mustn't ;miss a lecture
at Trinity College; you can go in free, and hear just as much as
you like. You ought to do that. Then—let me see—^ah!—you
must visit the National Schools: wonderful sight! I '11 give you an
introduction to Old Thingummy—I 've got his name at nome—the
Secretary—oh, the best fellow in the world!"' I note down hur-
riedly, so as not to lose a word of his valuable instruction (as some-
thing must come out of it at last), "National Schools—Sec. best
fellow in the world." Then I look up, inquiringly, for more.
"Of course," he says, "you'll go to the Phoenix—you should go
when there's something ' on'; but that you '11 find out. At least
I '11 give you a line to DR. MACSALVEH. Ah, you '11 like him
immensely!' Here he becomes enthusiastic. "He's the best, the
kindest, the warmest-hearted old boy that ever lived!"
I note down, " DR. MACSALVEK—best, kindest—ever lived."
Happy Thought.—What's his address?
Ah! that, KEPPEL can't recollect at the moment, but he has it at
home, and will write to the kindest and best of men immediately he
gets back to his rooms, to say that I 'm coming.
I thank him heartily. But still I want to know, though I do not
like to interrupt him in his flow of information, "How about my
line of country f"
"Oh," he says, as if this were a mere matter of course, "you '11
go to Bray, ana the Wicklow Mountains, and see all that."
I note down, for my itinerary, "Bray—Wicklow Mountains—
and all that."
"And," continues KEPPEL, "I'll give you an introduction to
FATHER TOM."
"Will yon?" I exclaim. I am now really delighted. This does
sound something like Irish life. It conjures up the Colleen Bmcn
scene, Eily O' Connor, Miles, and Father Tom brewing the whiskey
and singing " Grammachree ma Cruiskeen Lawn." Not to mention
"PHIZ'S" illustrations to Charles O'Malley, Jack Hinton, Harry
Lorrequer, from which delightful works by the late CHARLES LEVEU
my present store of knowledge of Ireland is principally derived.
"Ah," says KEPPEL, "you '11 be enchanted with him. Such wit!
such spirits! such but, upon my soul, I envy you your trip."
Happy Thought.—I am going to Ireland to see FATHER TOM.
should also like an introduction to Mi^es-na-Coppaleen, the Colleen
Sawn, and a few others of the same sort.

HORSE AND DOG DATS.
THE late weather, though inimical to verdure, has been
propitious to the Turf. Sporting men say they have not
for years known such heats at Goodwood.
"Oh!" KEPPEL goes on, rapturously, "I never spent such a
time as I did in Ireland. I wish I could manage to come with
you."
"Do," I say, heartily. (This is an inexpensive form of invitation,
and it somehow sounds uncommonly hospitable.)
"Ah, I 'm afraid I can't," he returns. "I would, if I hadn't an
appointment with a fellow here—most important: if I miss him I
shall lose a big chance—twenty thousand pounds p'raps."
KEPPEL has always a really forcible reason for not doing what he
is uncertain, at the moment, whether he would like to dp or not. He
is invariably going to meet some one who will make his (KEPPEL'S)
fortune on the spot; only—though he has been going to meet this
enterprising capitalist any time within these last ten years—the
expected individual has somehow or another failed, at the last
moment, to put in an appearance. Ask KEPPEL afterwards how it
was that the great event didn't come off, he will answer carelessly,
and just as contentedly as though he had realised a fortune by the
transaction, "Oh, I don't know. There was some muddle some-
where. It would have been a 'big thing,' if it had come off. But"
—and he becomes confidential—"I've got something on now, my
boy . . . only I can't mention it to a soul at present. . . but, I 've to
meet a man "—here he refers to his watch, which he has appa-
rently set by this other man's—"in half an hour, who'll tell me
whether he will undertake it or not. If he does, and I 'm pretty
sure he will, it's a fortune. Sorry I can't stop now, as I've to
meet him. Ta! ta!" and he's off.
We part. He promises me letters of introduction to everyone in
and out of Dublin, and even to the Steward of the Holyhead steamer.
"Telegraph for a berth," are his last words as he leaves me, "and"
—this very heartily—" mention my name."
"I will!" I say, with equal heartiness. But when he has dis-
appeared it occurs to me that there will be a difficulty about tele-
graphing for a berth to the Steward (which Steward? which
steamer ?), and mentioning somebody else's name. For example:—
"From Myself to Steward of Steamer.—Keep berth for me,
because you know MR. KEPPEL BIBKETT."
Must send to KEPPEL, and ask him for further details. In the
meantime I feel that now I have a chance; now
Hapny Thought (quotation).—" Now I'm furnished for my flight,"
or shall De directly I get the letters from K. B.
At all events I 've made some useful notes. I will read them.

tains . . . "all that"... FATHER TOM . ..
And that's all. A little vague.
In my Boom.—While thinking of writing to KEPPEL, his servant
comes with a packet. KEPPEL BIRKETT has been better than his
word. Five letters of introduction, and a note to wish me ban
voyage^ and to tell me that he has been writing to everyone.
Arrival of Post.—Letter from FORDE MACKINNON. He has
written to everyone too, and sends me names and addresses.
Happy Thought.—Yes. Now I am furnished for my flight.
Next Step.—Euston Station. Late train. London, farewell! As
I step out of the cab at Euston already I feel an Irish influence
stealing over me. I am inclined to say to the Cabman, who objects
to eighteenpence, "Bedad, Sorr! will ye tread on the tail of me
coat?" But I only think this, I don't say it: perhaps if I had a
shillelagh I might. Instead, I refer the matter to a Policeman,
who sides with the Cabman, and I give the man two shillings,
with twopence to the Policeman for his opinion.
Happy Thought.— Much Continental travelling has accustomed
English voyaaeurs to give sous to foreign porters, and. on their
return to England, they keep up the practice in pence. At least, /
do; and, of course, I represent a section of the public. Years ago,
nothing was given under a shilling, or sixpence at the least. The
introduction of threepences was a great saving, besides having a
pretty effect as a gift. But why give a Policeman twopence for an
adverse opinion? (Notes made while waiting at the Station for half
an hour before the train starts.)

ME DEAR TIM, Sunday.
I GOT yours and was very glad to have heerd from you.
Faix and I '11 be glad to get out of this, divil such a place iver I see.
The rigment left Horsham for this on Thursday, we was up at 5 in
the morning drillin then marched a thunderin long way to some
place where the railway was, Gilford they called it I think but these
English names bother me intirely, well bedad when we got there
nivir a train was riddy at all at all, and there we was waitin till one
in the mornin lyin out in a field as though we was sheep. Thin we
took our sates, and sure them caridges are not as good as on our own
Athenry and Tuam Line, and a desperate crowd in it always. Well
when we got to this Aldershot we had to pitch our tents, and no food
or fire to be had, nivir a bit I got from Thursday at noon till nine
o'clock on Friday mornin. Ye'l see a grate change in me, I'm
worn to the bone intirely.
There was a terrybel day yesterday what these English call a
revew. We had to be under arrums at half past one. I thought to
get off savin I was ill, but the Docthor was too cute for me. Hah
ye schammg scoundrel says he get back wid ye to the ranks, dont
let me have any more of your dirthy thricks or twill be worse for
ye. So bedad away they marched us over a powderin dusty plane,
not worth a shillin an acre 'twouldnt feed a goat itself leave alone a
sheep. Mewather botle Icked and ivery drop ran away on me before
we got to the ground at all, only for JIM MURPHY givin me a sup I
would be dead with the thirst. "Well sure there was a powerful dale
of throop on the ground. Them men with black horses, and kind of
dish covers on them was a fine lot, but all that iron must be killin
hot. We marched past the Prince in grate style t'waa a fine day for
Ireland anyway, but what with the manuverin back and forards I
went near being kilt and murthered. The megur is a desperate
hard man, as we came home the thirst was on me so bad, that crossin
the canal, I was nearly bet up altogether, so I made one rush to get
a drop of wather in me shaco, faith he was down on me like a cat
afther a mouse, and his sowrd drawn, and the grate black horse he
has tearin afther me like blazes. Give me one drop Meejur says I,
oh you chiken hearted villin says he get back wid ye now like
lightnin or I '11 kill ye ye ruffin says he. Fail ye may swear I was
back soon enough for sure he 's awful determined and I didnt know
what he might tto to me. Well Tilt take me word for it, and niver
jine the mileesha, I 'd rather be in the poorhouse itself than soljerin
again, so I would. There's the bugle bad cess to it, so no more now
from your frend pAT EGAN.

HORRIBLY hot? Ah! no doubt—in the City;
Phoebus is there an ignipotent foe,
Sunshine a thing to be shunned—more 'a tho pity:
Here we exult in Sol's aureate glow.

What need we care, in this verdurous glade.

Ninety degrees in the shade?
Summer at last! Sure a seven years' waiting
Seems to have passed since we saw her full face.
How the leaves laugh at her! Town-thralls are rating
Her too torrid glance in their verdureless place.
Here she smiles soft through a veil of glad greenery.
So, doff your hat, dear. Nay, bind not that braid.
Pleasant to gaze on yon sun-suffused scenery,—
Ninety degrees in the shade!
Cool is the plash of the river, and cooling
Each curve of your drapery. You have a lore.
Taught you by Nature, that needs not the schooling

In sober truth, though you mock it so merrily,
Scarce were Sabrina more aptly arrayed.
Gazing upon you I ask, is it, verily.

HYGIENE IN HOT WEATHER.
A MILLER, as is well known, wears his hat for the purpose of
keeping his head warm. What is applicable to the head is appli-
cable to the whole body from top to toe; therefore, to keep the head
cool, a black hat is preferable, and for the body likewise a suit of
sable. Contrarily, therefore, to common practice, instead of wearing
light-coloured fabrics with the temperature at 80° in the shade, put
yourself into decent mourning.
Such being the fact that colds are sometimes caught in hot weather
through sitting in a draught, carefully close all doors and windows
both day and night.
Health chiefly suffers from excessive perspiration, which is very
"lowering," consequently strength requires to be kept up by repa-
ration of wasted tissue, particularly by eating and drinking as much
as possible of solid f ooa and cordial and generous liquor, chops and
steaks, bottled stout, port wine, grog, punch, in addition to all the
lighter wines and other beverages commonly in use. Tripe-and-
onions and Irish stew are peculiarly wholesome; and a broiling
summer is really the right season for Christmas plum-pudding. It
is a mistake to suppose that the diet should consist principally of
fish, fruit, and vegetables, though if plenty of more nutritious food
be taken, the more of those other things you eat, too, the better.
After a full meal rest is indispensable; indeed, as little exercise
should be taken as possible, for any attempt to move is felt to be
laborious, and the sense of developed energy and relief from
oppression developed, for example, by resolute perseverance in
walking, is fallacious. In India men commonly recline in a high
temperature, sipping brandy-pawnee with great benefit to their
livers, as is well known; ana you cannot do better, if you have
nothing else to do, than sit still the greater part of the day between
your meals, or, at any rate, after dinner till supper-time, and after
that till bed-time, smoking cigars and drinking soda-water and
brandy. If you feel any sense of the sort of discomfort commonly
called " seediness," of a morning, you will find a glass of sherry-
and-bitters, or a little absinthe, or some other kind of innocent
"pick-me-up," quickly put you all to rights again without the least
detriment to your constitution.

BORN JUNE 29, 1827.
DIED JULY 28, 1876.
THE Everlasting Silence has suddenly come down npon a clear, .joyous, and musical voice, which
for the last two years has rung among the most regular as well as blithest in our weekly concert.
MORTIMER COLLINS, in the apparent fulness of health and strength, has been carried off, after

harness." "" The natural end," the Cynic may say, "of the literary hack." Not the less sad is the
thought how much nobler in results, as well as longer-sustained, his labour might have been under
better-regulated conditions and happier circumstances.
As Journalist (Provincial and Metropolitan), Essayist, Critic, Novelist, Poet, MORTIMER COLLINS
has done much gay and genial, much ingenious and suggestive, much graceful and scholarly, work;
though the best of it, no doubt, in all kinds, might, with more leisure, have been better. But though
the field was too constantly cropped for the harvest ever to come to its perfection, it grew always
wholesome and pure grain, with sap of scholarship, fine colour of fancy, and the juice of a large,
kindly, and generous nature. He wfote the Secret of Long Life to teach men to live a century, and
himself died at forty-nine.
He was a man who, in an unconventional way, deeply believed in God, and strove to do his duty
honestly and punctually by his employers, loving his family and friends: variously accomplished,
happy under hard labour, and helpful to all he could help, by word or deed.
Two stanzas of a Poem which terminates his last published volume of Verse may form his
worthiest epitaph:—
"Tho Poet may tread earth sadly,
Yet ia ho Dreamland's Icing,
And the f.-i.v at his bidding gladly
Visions of beauty bring;
But his joys will be rarer, finer,
Away from this earthly stage,
When ho, who is now a minor,
Comes of age.
"Doll on, O tardy cycle,
Whose death is the Poet'* birth!
Blow soon, groat trump of Michael,
Shatter the crust of earth!
Let the slow spheres turn faster;
H ;i -urn the heritage
Of him who, a« life's true master,
Comes of age !''

PADDY'S AUTONOMY.
THERE'S a mighty fine thing in vogue,
Which, by divil a bit of pseudonomy,
In an iligant Grecian brogue
Slav insurgents call " Autonomy:"
Jupiter, Venus, and Mars,
Wid the rest of our scheme of astronomy,
Is a system of separate stars,
That has aich got its own " Autonomy."
"Tis a plain and simple phrase,
Not at all at all a metonymy,
For it manes just as much as it says
Without the laist smack of homonymy.
The Jews, in the times of old,
According to Deuteronomy,
By the best accounts we "re told,
Enjoyed a nate "Autonomy."
And who can be such a fool
As not to perceive the synonomy
Of the terrum with Burr's " Home Rule,"
Or, "Irish Domestic Economy "?
POISONS AND FIGS.
NOTE a strange, hut seasonable, paragraph in the Pall MM
Gazette concerning:—
"TARTAR EMETIC.—At Ballina, on Wednesday, a grocer was remanded on
the charge of gelling tartar emetic for cream of tartar. Five persons had a
narrow escape from death through the mistake."
Is it lawful for a grocer to sell tartar emetic at all? In that case
the sooner it ceases to be lawful the better; unless on condition
that grocers shall have to be qualified by a proper examination to
deal in drugs, as well as in groceries. Even then it would be desirable
that an extended inscription over the grocer's shop-door should
describe him as "Licensed to deal in tea, coffee, tobacco, snu IV,
arsenic, corrosive sublimate, prussio acid, oil of vitriol, tartar
emetic, vinegar, pepper, and poisons generally."

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

SATTTRDAY sitting, July 29. Better day, better
deed. The House met and fought the Education
Bill as far as Report, so as to leave Monday free
for the Eastern Question.
Monday, July 31.—"Who'll tread on the tail
of my Foreign Office uniform P" might have
been LORD T)ERBY'S cry—(Lords)—through a
night's talk, in which nobody seemed disposed to
turn on any tap stronger than milk and water.
LORD STRATHEDEN'S tame Resolution in favour
ot supporting the treatios of 185(i, was followed
up by a long-winded vindication of our policy in
the'Crimean War from LORD GRANVILLE, spiced with a little mild objurgation of Turkey, as a Power that had violated every undertaking
with her political as with her pecuniary creditors, and a passing fling at the Government for not more effectually interfering in
the framing of the Andrassy Note, and for sending the Fleet to Besika Bay, without explanation whether that move was made as an
intimation to Russia, a hint to the Porte, or a defence of the Christians. Most people will echo LORD GHANVILLE'S amiable wish
that LORD DERBY will "hasten, rather than delay, the moment where Europe in concert can by diplomatic action put an end to a
state of things which is fatal to the Christians, ruinous to the Turks, and which the longer it lasts is the more sure to lead to European
complications;" and that " whatever is done, every care will be taken to secure the welfare and good government of our fellow-religionists
in Turkey." "These be brave 'orts! marvellous brave 'orts!" as Fluellen says. Well, good wishes can't hurt anybody; and fine
words break no bones, if they butter no parsnips.
LORD DERBY might well say he felt rather like a Minister waiting to return thanks for his health, than a Foreign Secretary on defence
of his policy. He found himself reduced to the humiliating necessity of agreeing with LORD GRA»"VTLLE in almost everything.
degree "—nothing like putting a fine diplomatic point on it—" to the insurrectionary movements
months." As for the Andrassy Pie, we had quite as much of a finger in it as was desirable; and as to the Berlin Memorandum, not
only were we well out of it, but all the Powers were thankful to us for enabling them to be well out of it too. The fact is, we were the
first for keeping a ring, and now all the Powers are helping us to keep it. So the talk wore on with a dreary absence of variance, even
LORD HAMMOND falling into the tune of the time, and warning the Turk, that, if he wasn't a better boy. BRITANNIA would no longer
stand his friend. As for LORD BATH, he roundly lectured LORD DERBY on his want of bowels, calling Turkish rule the most brutal tnat
ever disgraced the earth, and warning the Government that the country was sick of the Turks, and would stand no more Crimean wars.

Traveller. "AND "GOT ANT ICE?"

Traveller. "THEN TELL 'CHAMB'MAID TO RUN A PAN OF ICE THROUGH MY
BED, AND LET ME HAVE MY CANDLE. I FLL TURN IN!!"
LORD WAVENEY was all for a Conference of the Powers, with Besika Bay for a
background, and "the British Fleet a riding at anchor" to determine the
balance of the Powers.
• After a plaintive remonstrance from poor LORD STRATH-EDEN AND CAMPBELL.
that his Speech and Resolution had been pooh-poohed by LORD GRANVILLE and
shunted by LORD DERBY, but never argued or answered by anybody, the DUKE
or RICHMOND moved and carried the Previous Question without a division.
Was there ever a question previous to our old friend, the Great Eastern?
(Commons.)—Touching tableau—BENJAMIN protecting the Innocents! But
"the good die first," as WORDSWORTH says. The Government clings to
Vivisection, but sacrifices the Prison Bill—the most practical measure of the
Session—and the two Universities Bills. Then there is the Extradition Treaty
breakdown—one of the most serious of the many Government blunders of the
year—yet to be talked over, and the Indian Budget to be knocked off in the
expiring moments of an empty and exhausted House, and Supply still to be con-
cluded, including the cost of MR. CAVE'S well-meant but ineffectual attempt
at the great Egyptian balancing trick, and the Education Bill to be threshed
through Third Heading. But don't let us anticipate.
Then arose The BRUCE, and brought in the Eastern Question with kid gloves
on. All movers of the question had been busy taking all possible' offence
out of their Motions, but, of all the rose-water Resolutions, The BHUCE'S was
the rosiest. It was the Eastern Question strained through several folds of
Ottoman Bank paper. Our interest in retaining the Turks at Constantinople
was not because they were Turks (particularly after they have repudiated
and brought down Ottoman Bank Stock so shamefully), .but because they were
an unaggressive and settled Power (" settled, "wepresume, on the "luciis a non
Ittcenifa principle, from not settling). The grievances of the Insurgents were
more fiscal and agrarian than religious.—(Provided you pick a man's pocket,
outrage his wife, and cut his throat, we should have thought it didn't much
matter under what epithet yon pigeon-hole his case.) The dispatch of the Fleet
to Besika Bay relieved the Turk from the apprehension that he was going to be
crushed without consideration or fair play, calmed his irritation, and prevented
repetition of outrages. Non-intervention is the best
policy, but, when the time comes for the Powers to act, they
must enlist Moslem support for their reforms. Matters
can't be settled by merely backing Cross against Crescent.
MR. HANBTJRT (not the well-known Entire, but a very
diluted tap !) thought the Turks the only hand to which
we could trust the keys of Asia. It wasn't the Turkish
Government that had oppressed the Rayahs, but the
Mahometan Slavs, and their own Bishops. He looked to
the Serbs as a barrier against Russia.
MR. FOHSYTH moved the one Amendment of the night
with some pith in it, purging the Government to insist
on effectual guarantees for good government irrespective
of race and creed. Pace BRUCE and HANBURY, it was
the FORTE'S corruption and misgovernment and the
Turkish rulers' cruelty that had provoked insurrection.
LORD E. FITZMAURICE followed on the same tack, and
advocated autonomy for the Balkan Provinces.
MR. HOLMS took up his parable lustily against the
Turks.
ME. GLADSTONE maintained that the upshot of the
Crimean War was to give us a right to interfere and
remonstrate with the. Porte. The Turk had not fulfilled
his promises, because he couldn't. The Government had
not sufficiently snubbed the Three Powers for presuming
to leave England out in the. cold. We ought not to have
rejected the Berlin Note without offering an alternative.
Something must be done to restore the European concert,
and that by way of self-government of the insurgent
provinces.
MR. DISRAELI complained of having no attack to
repel. Our policy was non-intervention. After the Berlin
Note we stood alone at first, but now the other five
Powers had come over to us. The sending of the Fleet
was not meant to threaten anybody. It was in the first
place a purely histrionic move. England, as a naval
Power, ought to be adequately represented by'a Fleet.
Then, it was not sent to protect the Turkish Empire, but
the British. The cue was non-intervention just now:
when the moment came for England to interfere, she
would interfere for the good of everybody.
LORD HARTINGTON said ditto to all the dittos—and
recommended the withdrawal of both Motion and Amend-
ment, and so the night's talk ended in general agreement
that nothing had been done, nothing ought to be done,
and that all was for.the best mthismost do-nothing of all
do-nothing worlds.
Tuesday (Lords).—LORD WAVENEY (SHAFro-ADAiR in
his late Lower Life), passed a favourable verdict on the
corpora rilia lately made subjects of Experimental
Mobilisation. The men had done very well—and would,
no doubt—like their officers and staff—do better. The
Reserve—what there was of them—had come well up to
time. The transport was susceptible of improvement.
LORD CADOGAN admitted that the Force " had not been
adequately provided with technical waggons." There
had not been more than two per cent, of absentees from
the Reserve.
LORD CARDWELL joined in the chorus of congratula-
tion. (The author of the Short Service Scheme has
every right to .be happy in results so far. If only our
corps could move when mobilised.)
LORD CARNARVON on the Barbadoes difficulty. A
careful summing up, and judicial distribution of wig-
gings. Confederation meant little more than amalga-
mation of municipal offices and expenses. Badians are
g-overbially stiff-necked and hot-headed. In POPE-
ENNESSY they met with a match. Hence naturally an
explosion. But if the POPE has been indiscreet, having
talked too big and too loose, and comported himself alto-
gether too much "More Hibernico," the Badian big-wigs
have been reckless, violent, and unscrupulous in word
and deed.
The best thing for Barbadoes would be remodelling of
its Government on the Jamaica model.
LORD CARNARVON supports his Governor like a gentle-
man; and there is far more to be said in excuse of
GOVERNOR HENNESSY, POPE though he be, than of those
who have so recklessly assailed him.
(Commons.)—MR. WAED HUNT told the sorry story of
the introduction of measles into Fiji, and made a feeble
attempt to apportion the blame for its introduction
between the naval and the colonial authorities. A
case of bungling all round—only to be explained to
BRITANNIA in DR. JOHNSON'S quaint fashion, "Ignor-
ance, Madam, sheer ignorance."

Supply. Education Estimates.
MB. A. B. HOPE and LORD ELCHO spoke an urgent word for the
British Museum Staff, at once the most efficient and worst-paid body
under Government. The protest came with appropriate grace from
3opE—hope long-deferred. ME. W. H. SMITH promised that any
advance should be a discriminating advance.
It is wonderful how intensely careful the Treasury'grows over a
proposed rise in the salaries of the one set of specially qualified
icholars and archreologists in the Government service. Not a staff
of the most commonplace clerks in the most routine office but can
(rive the British Museum assistants long odds in the way.'of salary.
Yet when a rise to something like the usual official level is asked for,
what a marvellously nice conscience is brought to bear on their
case by MR. W. H. SMITH—" while the Government desired to do
justice to a staff of gentlemen, than whom none could be more able,
;hey were at the same time conscious of the responsibility which
rested on them not to give more in any case, or under any circum-
stances, than the just claims of the officers entitled them to receive."
Bv all means, ME. SMITH. Who asks you to do otherwise? Only
do that, and the British Museum Staff, and Punch, will be perfectly
satisfied. Hut do that, if you please, ME. SMITH, and you, Messieurs
Treasury Clerks,
"Who, 'neath the eye of LINOEN and of LAW,

LOBD SANDON'S Education Estimates. English, show a rise of
£158,492; Scotch, of £81,817, with excellent results for the money:
the Irish estimates, arise of .some'£21,810 in teachers' salaries and
allowances, against a reduction of some £15.000 in school-farms,
school-apparatus, and teachers' residences. The Act of last Session
has failed to improve the payment of teachers; but Government
is still tinkering at it, rather than boldly making the proper pay-
ment of teachers out of a national rate compulsory. The im-
provement of the National School Teachers'position is the key" to
all real improvement of Ireland, and the needful work has yet to be
done.
SIB W. HABCOUBT raised the nice question whether ME. SCLATEE-
BOOTH'S Rivers Pollution Bill is better than nothing. If ^SiB
WILLIAM wants Mr. Punch's opinion, that is precisely the right
estimate of it—-just better, than nothing; how little better, Punch
cannot find any word to express.
After an attempt at a Count-Out, another night was added to
those already lost this Session in attempting to induce the House to
release the nine Irish political prisoners still in confinement. The
debate was remarkable for ME. BEISHT'S appearance as an advocate
for the release of the prisoners—including the two still in prison for
the shooting of BEETT, the Manchester policeman, and the soldiers
who have violated their oath of enlistment. MB. BBIGHT wenl
further than his best friends are likely to go with him. He
argued against the established rule of law, that concert in a joini
purpose to violate the law makes common guilt; and contendec
that a soldier's breaking his oath is not a more heinous offence
than another man's. Punch finds it difficult to say which doctrine
strikes him as the more dangerous.
The weather was too hot for the subject, and the House broke oui
more than once in highly inflammatory utterances. But the Motion
was lost by 117 to 51.
Wednesday.—The centre of interest was shifted from St. Stephen's
to the Mansion House, though with DISBAELI and DEBBY absent.
Nobody would listen to Chairman RAIKES on Parliamentary

ntich snarling in its day; and LOBD SANDON, instead, provides that
loards of Guardians, everywhere, may pay the fees for children
whose parents can't pav, at the Schools of the parents' choice. So

am myself, and before I have determined upon a course of action—
that is, whether to admit, or deny, my identity—he produces two
envelopes, one long and large, the other small but bulky, shows me
the address, observes, "For you, Sir, I believe?" and, as I murmur
an affirmative, he opens the bulky one himself, takes out two sove-
reigns and a few shillings, hands them to me, observing, "For you,
Sir, from PLUMPTON AND SPBY."
Happy Thought (undoubtedly).—Pocket the coin.
Suppose, even, that this is an amiable and harmless lunatic, who
6oes about thinking himself PLUMPTON AND SPBY (whoever they
may be—clearly not twins), and giving people sovereigns, still,
evidently, one should not refuse to accept the gifts, if only to keep
him quiet.
Guard watching intensely. He has made up his mind that I am
some one in disguise—Fenian probably—only the two sovereigns
have puzzled him. He has his eye on us.
"From PLUMPTON AND SPHY'S," says the respectable man in
black. "MB. PLUMPTON heard you were going away to Ireland
from MB. BlEKEXT.and so he thought he would just catch you before
you were off." Whereupon he hands me the long, legal-looking
envelope.
I open the paper. It is headed, " In the High Court of Justice.
Is it a practical joke? No; the Clerk for MESSES. PLUMPION ANI
SPHY explains that I am subpcena'd as a Witness in a question oi
right of way.
But what an awfully startling form to a nervous temperament is
this snbpoona paper. The medical profession ought to protest
against it. on physical grounds; the clergy on moral grounds. Let
me put the case. You are an innocent man, but a nervous one

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
You haven't done anything contrary to Law—at least, not that you
are aware of: only, you suddenly remember that, four years ago,
you were a little uncertain about joining the Directorship of that
Company, of which you had heard fittle or nothing, except what your
esteemed and respected friend (a man of vast commercial experi-
ence) had chosen to tell you. Has some prying, meddling, sensation-
loving Shareholder started up, and insisted upon an exhumation
of that Company's body, and a consequent inquest? If so ...
Then the nervous man reads the summons: " VICTORIA" (inlarge
letters, of a fanciful nourishing character), "by the Grace of God,
of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland" (this is HEE
MAJESTY'S address, should you wish to write to her), " Queen, De-
/emfer of the Faith"Jtfaa title suggests to the nervous man the
possibility of his having unconsciously offended against some old
ecclesiastical Law—but he cannot call to mind any statute he might
have contravened, except, perhaps, something about "a fine of nve
shillings for swearing), "to" (So-and-so—here follows the name),
"Greeting" (which is the first sign of politeness on the part of
Eoyalty, and of. a wish to make things pleasant. It puts the ner-
vous man temporarily at his ease. He breathes again; he looks
round; he smiles; he experiences a tingling of loyalty in his heart,
and, expecting something still more paternal, or maternal, and
cheering, he resumes his perusal. But the tone is suddenly and inex-
plicably changed. So rapid is this alteration, that, had somebody.
six feet two high, and powerful in proportion, smilingly beckoned
you up-stairs, and then, on your reaching the top, had changed from
lively to severe, and kicked you down again, the shock could not
be more electrical than this sudden assumption of fierceness. Thus
it goes on peremptorily:—) " We command you, and every of you"
(which appears unnecessary, as if you had some deep scheme for
evading the summons by sending your hat, or your carte de visite,
oryour wooden legs—if any), "that all things set aside" (this sounds
like a direction'to "leave your sticks and umbrellas in the hall"),
"and ceasing every excuse" (when as yet you haven't tried to raise
even one plea on your own behalf), "you and every of you be and
appear in your proper persons before" (now the tone changes to one
ol more than affectionate regard) "our right trusty and well-beloved
SIR PSTXR PYPBR" (or whatever the name for the time being may
be), "Sort., Lord Chief Justice of England, $c., on — day of by ten of the clock ".(what clock ?), " in the forenoon of the same
day, and so from day to day" (enough to worry a nervous man's
life out of him, merely to read this) "until the cause hereinafter

confusing, but the sequence is clear) "of Oit« Hundred Pounds."
Whereupon the nervous man collapses. Now, why cannot it be
put simply thus ?—
"SIR,—You will have to attend as a Witness, on and after— day*
at — A.M., in such-and-such a case, at—. The penalty for non-
attendance is £100."
Happy Thought.—Reform of legal forms. However, not having
time to go into the subject, at the station, with the Clerk from

am uncertain as to my return."
PLUMPTON AND Spar, however, have provided for this emer-
gency. "Wherever you may be, Sir," says the Clerk, with a tinge
of sadness in his voice, "you will have the goodness to keep MESSRS.
PUTMPTON AND SPRY informed of your movements by letter, or tele-
gram. Then we can summon you at a moment's notice, it wanted,
and we shan't detain you five minutes."
So, chained by a telegraph cable—PLUMPTON AND Spur being
at one end, and myself at the other—I am off for a holiday's enjoy-
ment to Ireland!
Supposing at the Giant's Causeway I receive a telegram—" Come
back from Erin. Shan't keep you five minutes. Judge waiting "—
there would be an end of all my amusement.
Why couldn't my examination, as a witness, be conducted by tele-
gram f Only a very little extra expense, really only a few shillings,
and why should I, or " any of me," be brought up bodily?

tell the truth by telegram just as well, and better, than if I were
being brow-beat in a witness-box, with the eyes of the Judge,
Counsel, Jury, Reporters, Illustrated Paper Artists, Police. Usher,
and Public on me? Certainly. Why the thing might be done
beautifully, and our legal machinery simplified by wiring.
To put it clearly and dramatically, thus:

(They take the next Witness, squeeze him dry in a quarter of an hour,

pausing for a minute, my Lud, to refresh his memorv.
The Judge (leaning back). Oh, very good. (Wishes he could
refresh his memory too. Looks at his watch.) Just send to your
Witness to tell him to get on—or, if he is going to have his lunch
brought to him out-of-doors, we can take ours at the same time. It
only wants half an hour of our usual adjournment.
Witness (on receiving the message). Thanks. Only some cold
chicken and whiskey and potass. Pipe afterwards. Call it half
an hour, and "I'm on." I shan't stir from here, so won't incur any
unnecessary expense.
The Judge (after hearing this read out). Good. Then (to Counsel)
we 'd better adjourn. (To Jury.) In three-quarters of an hour from.
now, Gentlemen. [Exeunt omnes.
When they return, of course, the Witness gives his evidence with
a will, stands the fire of a searching electric cross-examination, and,
after all, serves the cause of justice far more effectually than if he
had travelled a thousand miles, tired himself out, and had come up
ill, worried, and irritable into the box in the Court of Queen's
Bench.
I present these suggestions as Happy Thoughts to the Bench, the,
Bar, and the legal profession generally,—and, without further note
or comment, I am, at last, off for Quid Ireland.
SENTIMENT AT STRATFORD-ON-AVON.
IT appears from the gratifying paragraph below quoted, that,
though utilitarianism has triumphed, still unproductive sentiment
prevails to a considerable extent amongst the inhabitants of ~a
municipality associated with the memory of a poet, the late MB.
WILLIAH SHAKSPEAKB:—
"THE CUHFBW BELL.—The Stratford-on-Avon Town Council yesterday,
by a majority of one, decided to discontinue the ringing of the Curfew Bell, a
custom which has been observed for several hundred years. There was strong
opposition to the proposal to abolish such an ancient custom."
In fact, it seems that nearly half the Stratford-on-Avon Town
Councillors were unable to see that the Curfew, in this age of gas, to
say nothing of railways and electric telegraphs, was a mere
anachronism, that it had long ceased to admonish people to put out
their fires and candles, and had sunk into a mere survival, prolonged
by nothing but an idle veneration for antiquity. The feeling which
made so large a minority of them object to abolish the ringing of an
old bell would no doubt also make them wish to see weather-stains
and ivy continue to deface an old bell-tower. To be sure, the
majority have just managed to
« Silence that dreadful bell."
But it appears likely that they will encounter a strong opposition to
any proposal they may by-and-by make to Improve SHAKSJPEABE'S
monument by whitewashing It, or to defy superstition by removing
both it and the remains beneath it to another site.
THE END OP THE SESSION.—Smoke.

MORAL PLUCK.
Paterfamilias, who, under pretext of seeking a suitable French watering-place for his Family, has enjoyed a deligfttful three weeks' trip on the
French coast with a congenial Bachelor Friend, returns to his Penates, and after partaking duly of refreshment, delivers himself thiis:—" WELL,
MY DEARS, WE'VE TRIED TROUVILLB, DIEPPE, fJTRETAT, TfifePORT, BOULOGNE, AND ALL, AND HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT
'THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME!' 'ENGLAND, WITH ALL THY FAULTS I LOVE THEE STILL!' AND I PROPOSE"

From BULL to BENJAMIN.
"I never adopted that Coflee-houae babble, brought by a Bulgarian to the
Vice-Consul, aa authentic information which we ought to receive."—
MR. DISRAILI.
"COFFEE-HOUSE babble"? BEXJAMUT, my boy,
That sounds a very pat and pithy summary,
Nor do I quite expect you to employ
The hot philanthropist's effusive flummery;
But, thougn of fuss IT'm far from being fond,
The news I 'm getting now my dander raises
To heat that's just a little bit beyond
The chilling power of cool official phrases.
Moslem and Christian! Blood both flags must drench,
When Crescent flies on Cross, and Cross oa Crescent!
But not the coldest DEEBT douche can quench
Wrath at some wrongs to coolness acquiescent:
Fire, plunder, prison, butchery, bestial lust,
Are things to mix hot rage my scalding shame with,
Which no snow-blooded policy, I trust,
Will ever load my soul or stain my name with.
The status quo f Oh bless me, yes, I know.
I 've backed and buttressed that with blood and treasure;
Show me good cause and both of them shall flow
Once more, with promptitude, if scarce with pleasure.
But fight 'gainst new life waking t Lend my face
To merciless misrule and wholesale murder?
Considering my history, and race,
Few propositions well could look absurder.
Not mine, thank Heaven, the calm official mind
That smiles to scorn such strong words as " atrocity;"
Some outrages too devilish I find
To treat with epigram or smooth pomposity.
"Coffee-house babble " may not mean as much
As gushers paint in their too graphic strictures,
But yet my shuddering sense thrills to the touch
Of too familiar horror in their pictures.
Though optimistic HANBUBY gloss and gild
The blood-stained Crescent raised before the nations,
The Palace of fine Fancy he would build
Seems a Fool's Paradise on sand foundations.
'Tis hard to hold the balance? Very like;
That "s why I 've not been hot to put my word in—
But peace must not help wrong, nor, if I strike,
Injustice weight the scale I throw my sword in.
Mild words, my BEN? Good! I would have them mild;
I know 'tis not the hour for angry bluster:
But while war—and wrong worse than war—runs wild,
Courts scheme, and armies mass, and navies muster,
'Twere just as well to have it clearly known—
In your own phrase of politic urbanity—
JOHN BULL can only make one side his own,
And that the side of justice and humanity!
A Party of Progress.
KARL RUSSELL, in his letter lately addressed to Loan GBANVILLE
on the Eastern Question, observes that:—" The Whig Party toast is
'Civil and Religious Liberty all over the World.'" True. This is
the old Whig Party toast. The toast of a party more advanced
would seem to be "Uncivil and Irreligious Licence all the World
over."

UNFASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
ME. BOUNCER
has left Town
for a week's
yachting, as he
says. His friends,
however, think
that he has merely
gone to Margate,
and bought a
yachting jacket.
Mus. STUBBS
gave a Ball at
her residence in
Camberwell, on
Thursday evening
last. SpaouTs.the
greengrocer, was
specially retained
for the occasion,
and the German
Band that plays
in the neighbour-
hood was engaged.
MB. FLTTTEB, having failed to get his Bill discounted, has been obliged to
leave his rooms, and start for Paris, without paying his rent.
The employes in the Firm of MESSES. SHOETJTEASUBE AND SHODDEE spent a
happy day at Rosherville (it being the Bank Holiday), on the 7th inst.
Miss SMITH has gone to Birmingham on a visit, for a few days, to her Uncle,
MB. BBOWN.
MB. GUTTLEE gave a small and early Dinner Party yesterday. Covers were

laid for thirteen guests, and the menu included (besides
turtle) eleven kinds of fish.
MB. GAHDEBLING, who lately joined the Slopshire
Volunteers, sprained his ankle yesterday while practising
the goose-step.
Mu. WAGG has been so prostrated by the heat of the
weather, that he has attended seven dinners without
making a joke.
MASTER SCEEECHEB, with a party of his Sunday
schoolfellows, went to Bushy Park last Monday in a
van: when they all enjoyed their usual yearly privilege
of screaming at the very tip-top of their voices, the
whole way there and back.
Miss DinrriE slipped and fell upon a flower-pot last
week, while attempting lawn tennis with her sister upon
the grass-plat.
The REV. MB. MUGGINS has recently arrived at Buo-

MR. PaiGGDis entertained ME. JONES and ME. JOWLEK
last Saturday at supper, at his lodgings in New Grub Street.
Miss RFNILEBLET has gone to Canada, with a view to

MB. DIDDLES has proposed a matrimonial alliance with
the widow of the late MB. EBENEZEB BLUNT.
ME. CLYFAKEB emerged from his retirement at
Holloway on Friday morning last, when a most distin-
guished company of his pals were assembled to meet
him, and stood a number of "drains round " in honour
of his release.
OUR OWN REPRESENTATIVE.
(He proposes going to the Wagner.Festival at Sayreuth, and is
off before we can stop him.)
DEAB SIR,
Excuse this short and hurried dispatch, but, while I write,
I am engaged in superintending the packing of my portmanteau.
I have a young black servant who was lately brought from the South
Guinea Coast, and this is the first time he has ever seen a portman-
teau. At first he was frightened of it, and inclined, not being a
well instructed Christian, to worship it as a god. When it closed up
suddenly of its own accord—as is the habit of portmanteaux, after
you 've got the upper compartment nicely packed, but not fastened—
and all my shirts came out in a heap, he started back, his hair came
out of curl, he turned quite white (fact!), then he made a rush for
the door, and bolted. Having succeeded in overcoming his supersti-
tion and his panic, I now find him inclined to treat the portman-
teau with contemptuous familiarity. He wishes to put in anything
anywhere, he conducts himself towards a pair of boots as though
they were on a footing with a fine well-got-up white shirt, and in
fact, my time just now is occupied in finishing the education of this
half-instructed blackamoor. He has much to unlearn, as much,
indeed, as he has to unpack : his notions of the'Catechism are limited
to a set of riddles (which I fancy he must have learnt from a Comio
Missionary), such as "Where was Moses when the candle went
out f" Who subscribed to the first newspaper ?" and so forth.
You would be touched by the earnestness and fervour of this
young negro, whose artless prattle draws tears from eyes unaccus-
tomed to weeping, when he tells of his friends and relatives now
suffering under the lash, and living in a brutalised state of un blissful
ignorance. I am getting up a subscription for SAM'S tribe, intend-
ing to bring them over en masse, as they would make excellent
servants in such an establishment as MB. HAXKEY has recently
started, or—they wouldn't do badly as a troupe round the country.
SAM, my boy, tells me he is not a cannibal, and he assures me that
he prefers our beef and mutton to anything he ever tasted. I am
sure you will head the list with a .handsome donation, and you
might put an iron box. with a patent padlock (I "11 supply it at my
own expense and find the key), outside your ofhce-door with " The
Black Soy Fund" written on it.
I will undertake that every penny, placed in that box by a generous
and Christianly charitable public, shall be spent upon the most
vjorthy objects; and if the money does not convert, clothe, and render
happy an entire tribe, it will not be the fault of the good-hearted
English subscribers to the "Slack Boy Fund!" Depend on me.
If necessary, I will go out myself with the money, and explore the
country. I am quite ready to fill the role of a Stanley, if you will
be as magnificently' enterprising as are the undaunted Proprietors
of the D-y T-l-gr-ph.
But I have not yet told you what I am packing up for. Pardon.
I am off to Bayreuth for the Wagner Festival. I am, myself, a
Wagnerite, tooth and nail, heart and soul! I may say, with diffi-
dence, that it was I who started Wagnerism in my dear old friend
WAGNER himself, years ago. Of course, what / lacked was the
technical knowledge to carry out my own idea. But I '11 explain
this later on,
You remember saying to me, despairingly, "How I wish I had
some real musical man, whom I could trust, to send to Bayreuth!"
I said nothing then; but I made up my mind: and when you ob-
served, after dinner, to me. "I wish you'd go to Bayreuth," I
replied, "Certainly." Now I 'm off.*
* We do not recall either of the occasions alluded to, but still if we did say
"Go to Bayreuth!" we are perfectly ready to abide by our word, as we
should have been had we only said, " Go to Bath!" No doubt there is a
large section of the music-loving public which will be heartily glad to
receive, from a trustworthy source, all the particulars of an event wbjch seems
to mark an era in the history of the Musical World (edited by our esteemed
friend and high-art critic Da. DISHI/BY PETERS, to whom we shall write to
keep an eye on our Correspondent at Bayreuth, where they will, probably,
meet). * * On reflection, we have written to our Contributor to say, " Put us
down for twenty pounds to the ' Slack Boy Fund.' Go to Bayreuth. On
your arrival you ought to flnd a circular note at the Post Office, not necessarily
for immediate and lavish expenditure, out a» a guarantee of our good faith."
The public may now rest assured that our excellent Representative will not
allow the grass to grow >mder hia feet. We act, now as always, in the
interests of civilisation, of journalism, and of an enlightened and appreciative
public. In spite of the vast additional expense incurred by these arrange-
ments, no extra charge will be made for our Journal. We can lay our hands
on our hearts and say that we shall be amply repaid for all our trouble by the
gratitude and delight of our readers, and this too, we feel assured, will be
equally the sentiment of our noble-hearted Contributor.—ED.
*»• (Just before going to press.)—The above idea we embodied in a note
to pur good friend. His reply was characteristic, though hardly, perhaps, so
satisfactory as we could have wished. Perhaps he was in a hurry.
"Dear Ed. Yes. 'Gratitude," &c., good. My notion to a turn. Only tend
cheque; or better,—send ten real sovereigns by hand, and I '11 make them last
me till I get to the Post Office, Bayreuth, and account to you afterwards .'"
To this we replied:
"On inquiry, we find you can get to Bayreuth for half the sum (while
double the amount would only delay you)—and, as that is all we happen to
have about us at the moment (and we shouldn't have had that, but for a
friend accidentally dropping in), we send it at once, so that you may not have
to complain of any delay on our part."
To which came back the answer:
"Good enough. Was just off when your boy arrived with the fiver. It is
a note, and I asked for gold. No matter; I can change it, at a slight loss
(which you can settle on my return), across the water. In the meantime, as
representing You, Sir, I have borrowed the required sum (twenty pounds) from
a dear, good, kind, noble old friend of Yours, to whom I have given a draught
on You, payable at sight. He will call on you in about an hour's time after
you receive this, when I shall be far away, careering, steam up, fast train,
high pressure, no-etopping-anywhere express, on tht other side of the glorious
old Channel. Pen»ez a mot I d M ton/ours.—T. R."
We have considered it our duty to publish this intact, as, in case of any
future difficulty—which we are far, of course, from apprehending—we shall be
able to call the Public as a witness to our own integrity. The Gentleman,

The portmanteau is packed. The Black Boy accompanies me. I
must have some one to accompany me " when I go on a musical tour
—(this is iLjeu de mot, or kommiktoordenspiel, for HERE WAGNEB.
Fits! !)—and I 've secured as a fellow-traveller, my dear old friend
the Swedish Pole, DR. SCHLAPPSHAGER, who was banished from Bul-
gravia for his political opinions, and, coming over here, wrote that
admirable article in the Threeweekly on " The B flat, and how to
catch it with a tuning-fork" which caused such a sensation in
musical and scientific circles. It was a masterly production. As
DK. SCHLAPPSHAGEB is not a rich man, I shall have to pay his ex-
penses. But he will be worth every Benny of 'em to You, Sir. He
is a large eater, but his liquor is a trifle; and you cannot, now-a-
days, get such rare musical talent as his for nothing. He is a
Practician as well as a Theorist, and brings his case of instruments
with him. We are going to do Wagner" all the way to Bay-
reuth. I am an adept on the banjo, the Doctor is A1 with the
accordion (which is his national instrument, and you should see him
whirling it about his head in a patriotic frenzy!), while the bones
naturally fall to my black boy, SAM. It is a brilliant notion, and I
fancy, judging by what is done on the road to Goodwood, Epsom,
and Ascot, that we ought to pick up a pretty grosehen on the road,
which we shall, of course, give to the starving poor, or some local
charity. We shall call ourselves the "Warbliingen Wagners."
That '11 fetch the Germans. No burnt cork. All white—hat, boots,
shirts, wigs, all white except SAM, who is the genuine article. Light
hearts and white hats! Off tpBayreuth! Train ready! Post the tin.
Vive WAGNER! We 're taking over an illumination and fireworks.

unfortunately, after we had left. In this weather, our business hours are
necessarily early. This may catch his eye; in which case, he will understand
that we hare been compelled, by sadden press of business, to go to Wales, but
hope to see him, and thank him for his kindness, immediately on our return.
The Public is now in full possession of all the preliminary circumstances, and
knows as much about our worthy Correspondent's musical expedition to Bay-
reuth, as, up to the present moment, we do ourselves. We sincerely trust that
the result will be highly satisfactory to all parties.—ED.
The Doctor is calling to me "Mein goot freund, man will unter
Segel gehen und wartet nur auf Sie .'" To which I reply " Kommt:
wir Sind fertig: nehmt diese zwei Manteltdche."* So off we go
with our two " Mantelsachs " (lovely word, eh P so expressive !), away
to Bayreuth! Soon you shall hear all the news from one who will
always sign himself, most affectionately and rovingly,
YOUB
* We have no doubt now of our Correspondent's good intention. He is
evidently a perfect German, and so is his friend. Whatever we may think of
his plan for travelling as " Warbling Wagners," we are sure that everything
will be done by him in excellent taste, and with a view to making the English
character respected on the Continent. At the same time our Readers must
make allowances for a man of undeniable genius. Genius is above rules; and
if Genius chooses to travel with a banjo, a German Professor with an accor-
dion, and a black servant with the bonus, we can but smile and pass on, mur-
muring, " Well, after all, what harm to anybody .'—and Genius is eccentric,
or it would not be Genius."
We feel these remarks (made in perfect good faith) are due both to our
enterprising Contributor and to the sagacity of our respected Readers. — ED.
Flea for Political Prisoners.
KILLING is no murder if complicated with treason. That renders
it a mere misdemeanor. A military offence, simply capital, becomes
a minor offence when treasonable besides. Treason is an extenuating
circumstance of mutiny and murder, and its commission in commit-
ting those crimes reduces murderers and mutineers to political
offenders. Therefore, instead of being hanged or shot, they ought,
if punished at all, and not, on the contrary, rewarded, to be con-
demned to nothing worse than temporary seclusion, and should, all
of them, after a merely nominal imprisonment, be respectfully
released.

FEOM out my garret, hot and high,
Pausing from work, I gaze adown
With longing looks intent to spy
The happy hurriers Out of Town.
Four-wheelers, groaning 'neath the load
That box-seat, roof, and footboard
crown;
Hansoms with luggage outside stowed
Of happy folks bound Out of Town.
Their baggage, destined for first-class,
Shames my one coat, once black, now
brown;
And a sigh comes, that I, alas!
Must only dream of Out of Town.
Thinking upon the days g^one by.
When young, defying Fortune's
frown,—
Light heart, and lighter luggage, I
Have gaily chartered Out of Town.
Oh for some drops of country dew,
If they would only help to drown
My longing for green pastures new—
Green of God's making—Out of Town!
Well, there's one comfort, now-a-days,
With intramural graves put down,
The poorest wretch for death that prays
May hope for one ride Out of Town.
When my last copy earns its pay,
And I am dead to verb and noun,
From ink to dust—I see my way
To that excursion Out 01 Town!
MESS SANA, ETC.
THERE will be one decided advantage in
the proposed new City of Hygeia. There
will, of course, be no necessity for the
iteration of the unmeaning greetings,
"How are you?" or, "How do you do?"
since the answer, "Very well, thank you,"
will be stereotyped.

AN EXACT ACCOUNT OF THE SULTAN'S.HEALTH.
(From a Comparison of Authorities.)
MUCH concern having been felt with regard to the health of
SULTAN Muiun THE FIFTH, Mr, Punch has been at some pains to
obtain the most reliable information on the subject, and hastens to
inform the public of the result.
It appears, then, from a careful collation of the most authentic
bulletins, that the SULTAN is suffering from softening of the brain,
delirium tremens, rheumatic paralysis, and other complaints. He
converses freely with those about him, attends public prayers, dis-
Slays great interest with regard to his family, and is a victim to a
isordered imagination—being, in fact, on the verge of insanity.
It cannot be surprising to hear, as a result of all this, t iiatllis Majesty
"lacks initiative power and vigour." He is very anxious about
the education and welfare of his son, SELAH EDDIN, aged twelve
years.
The above concatenation, besides fully bearing out the symptoms
already mentioned, no doubt also accounts for the Sultan's personal
appearance. Aged twenty-eight,Jhe5s of a greenish complexion, with
a leaden eye and a white beard! Besides the complaints above enu-
merated, he suffers from several painful skin diseases and a general
nervous prostration, produced by raki and absinthe. All these
afflictions together have the curious effect of rendering His Majesty
"visibly weaker" from day to day. Although the transaction of
business with the GEAND VIZIER and MIDHAT PASHA might be
expected to be somewhat fatiguing under the circumstances, still
the SULTAN is cheerful and fond of playing the piano. In con-
clusion, it may be stated that he is as well as ever he was in his
life, has not long to live, and (evidently more astute than any
European politician) "is perfectly aware of his position."

PATERFAMILIAS ON PIGTAILS.
"Materfamilias, maddened by the daily increasing insubordination of the
British Housemaid, the incapacity, extravagance, and by no means infrequent
alcoholism of the British Cook, and the rebelliousness even of the British
Scullerymaid, ... is furtively yet anxiously expecting the arrival on the
shores of Albion of the ' Heathen Chinee.' It has been bruited about . . .

barbarian housekeepers from their domestic difficulties."—Daily Teleyraph.
OLILOQUY of MR. B. on the

CAN'T say I've had that

berry, sure enough;
But omnipresentpigtails,

breeks, and faces buff!
The prospect pulls a man
up short, by Jingo!
Those Lady-Helps, looked'a rum start perhaps,
But quite a trifle when compared with thin go.
Don't cotton quite to those Celestial chaps.
I think I 've heard they funked them out in Frisco.
Thought they were only fit for growing tea.
Don't fancy JOHNNY dishing up my dinner!
I 'm not exactly sure that MRS. B.
Would trust the Baby to that saffron sinner.
All very well on tea-chests, queer and quaint;
Quite passable on screens and fancy crockery;
But nursing NELL !—'twould make AUNT BETSY faint!
I hope that I). T. means it all in mockery.
Worst of those blessed papers now-a-days,
They will go in for being deadly funny.
I like plain speech that means just what it says—
(That Standard is the paper for my money.)
But if it's serious? Well, no doubt, An-SiNG
May be a meek, industrious sort of fellow;
But those blue bed-gowns aren't my style of thing,
And blood is blood. An-SiNo's I'm sure is yellow!
Cheap? Civil? Caring nought for cuff or kick?
Nice change to have a servant that is trounceable.
JOHNNY will pocket " fum-fum" and "eat stick,"
While MARY ANNER 's dear, and rude, and bounceable:
As for pig-tails, one mustn't talk too loud,
Seeing the things our Women now are wearing—
But fancy living midst a family crowd
Of bare Mongolian pates! 'Twerc past all bearing!
Moreover labour may be made too cheap:
This Flowery overflow may swamp Creation.
Suppose An-SlNO should catch J. B. asleep,
And ply hit pidgin to our ruination I
Hard work, short commons P 'Taint the modern style,
Short hours, long pay, seems Labour's latest charter.
An-SiNO may slave, cat stick, half starve, and smile,
Yet that sleek Mongol may turn out a Tartar.
No, MRS. B.! I guess you 'd better bear
With MARY ANNER'S ways a little longer—
The Pigtails far outnumber us, I hear,
Let JOHN 'ware hawk if JOHNNY grows the stronger.
A world, too, like a willow-pattern plate
Is not the sort of thing my taste that pleases:
For China there has been a craze of late—
Do hope we shan't extend it to Chineees!

PUNCH AND PUFFERY.
GOOD old HOMER sometimes nods; and Punch may occasionally
take forty winks; but who has ever heard him talk "in his sleep?
"Aperiently," as Mrs. Gamp says, the author of the following
announcement in a morning paper—unconnected, however, with.
Mrs. Gamp:—
"THE YACHTING SEASON.—'There is nothing more refreshing than the
Rhinegau Champagne.'—Punch."
Mr. Punch does not remember ever having made this observation.
If it ever escaped him whilst dreaming, in a moment of slumber, he
will too probaoly, under the same conditions, say similar things.
The next of them, perhaps, will he an encomium on the S^ecialite
Sherrv; and by-and-by Mr. Punch will, without knowing it, extol
even HOLLOW AY'S Pills. But observe. Except through "uncon-
scious cerebration," and "reflex action," Punch never .puffs any-
thing but tobacco smoke. Not if he knows it. In the meanwhile
common sense shows how certain it must be that a puff falsely
attributed to Mr. Punch is a truthful advertisement.

[Only Ten Minutes to Dinner I
to encourage denominational teaching at the cost of School-Boards, as the re-
opening of an all but scarred wound, the friends of Education, who are not also
out-and-out Nonconformist partisans, could not tind it in their hearts to record
their votes against the Bill. The end was a poor array of 46 Noes on Third
Heading, which may be said to measure the strength in the House of the
party in whom hatred of the Establishment is stronger than love of Education.
MR. FORSTER did not vote.
launch can only say,
"Best, rest perturbed spirits!"
Happily these heats are of, and for, the House. They cool down in the actuali-
ties of Educational work. Partisans make much of them, pedagogues little,
parents least.
Dissection of the great Egyptian CAVE Bf ar. Post-mortem examinations are
not ageeable in hot weather, at best; and th; CAVE Bear has been dead and
buried for months. What use to dig the carcase up again—especially to write
over it such uncomplimentary epitaphs as MK. DODSON'S ("Ma. CAVE'S mission

The

that
the Acting Manager contemplated a grand coup da theatre, but that his col-
leagues in the Ministerial management shrank from the risk. GYE, not Govern-
ment, may have courage to bring out an Egyptian spectacle, regardless of
expense. So Aitla succeeds, while CAVE'S Inquiry is a failure, and Suez-Canal
Shares-Purchase only a half-success. But what is to be expected of a Cabinet
coach with a DEUBV Drag on, for all the showy driving of BEN on the Box?
The KHEDIVE a-sked for a Clerk, and we sent him a CAVE (as he is reported
to have said), to bury his credit in. Since our kind intervention, his bonds
have fallen twenty per cent., and every money-market of Europe is shut in
his face. Well may he ask, with a slight variation of Falstaff, " Call you this
backing your friend's bills?"
Monday (Lnnls).—Bill to extend English local Cattle-Plague preventive and
detective machinery to Ireland, and to include "horses" under general term
"animals," for the first time.
LOKD EMLY thought the Irish central system better than the English local.
LORD SiRATiLNALiUf had a little snap at Short Service, and a grumble over
the Reserve.
LORD CAKDWELL said he had hoped LORD STRATH-
NAIRN, after what we had seen, would have given a good
word to the Reserve. But not a good word had been
vouchsafed. LORD RAGLAN had complained in the
Crimea that the recruits "died like flies." These Re-
serve men were not the style of fellows to die like flies.
No "fly" about them.
LORD DORCHESTER didn't know about that; hut twenty
years' service men were better than two. The War Office
boasted of 60,000 Reserve men. The country wanted
five times as many.
(Commons.)—Bulgarian Atrocities. A hideous sub-
ject, of which Government has heard a good deal —
though not from its Official Correspondents — and is
likely to hear a good deal more.
MR. ANDERSON quoted the indescribable horrors in a
recent report published in the Daily Weirs.
M_R. MtiNDKLLA, CAPTAIN' HAYTEH, JACOB BRIGHT,
MR. WHITWELL, and MR. COWEN tried to say what
England feels, not only about the hideous atrocities
tolerated, if not directed, in Bulgaria by the Turkish
Government, but about the slackness of England's offit-ial
eye, ear, ana tongue at Constantinople to see, hear, and
speak the truth on this repulsive subject. SIR HENUY
ELLIOT'S pre-determination seems to have been to dis-
believe everything against the Turks or tor the Bulgarian
rayahs. When forced to direct inquiry by LORD DERBY'S
positive instructions, he sends an agent who understands
neither Turkish nor Bulgarian, in charge of his father-
in-law, a notorious partisan of the Turk. Altogether,
if England—as well as facts—are not effectually mis-
represented at this crisis, it seems that it will not be
the fault of the English Embassy at Constantinople.
MR. BOURKE made the best of his bad case—his cue
being to destroy the credit of the newspaper corre-
spondents, and bolster up the credit of the official re-
porters. Time will very shortly decide between them
all that it has not already decided. But does any one
that knows Turkey and the Turks doubt how the case
really stands? If we wish to see how it lies, we may
turn to EDIB-EFFENDI'S report, which SIB HENRY ELLIOT
quotes as if he believed it.
Let Punch speak his mind in this matter. Political
Eartisanship and party spirit are both at low; as well as
ike-warm, water in England just now; but, if anything
will fire JOHN BULL'S blood to feverheat, it is such horrors
as have been perpetrated in Bulgaria—and part of his
wrath will assuredly be visited on those who have striven
to interpose official blinds or buffers between England
and the sight or shock of these horrors. If one thing is
more clear than another, it is that the attempt to soften
them is past BAKING—or his father-in-law, GCARACIKO,
either. The head of Her Majesty's Opposition asserted
for the Newspaper Correspondents the credit which
English common-sense and experience unite to claim, for
them.
Tuesday (Lords).
"Calm in the Peers, and reason cool,
E'en on the Education Bill,
That made with strife the Commons shrill,
Shaping such shindy out of School."
Yes—there were the DUTTE, and LORD GRANVTLLE, and
the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and LOKD RIPON, and
LORD SALISBURY, all with their heads together over the
Bill, and never a quarrel in the quintette!
"Ye Commons' cry of Curs"—take a lesson! How
infinitely more becoming, both the subject and the wea-
ther, is this Lordly coolness and calmness, than your
hasty heats and rampant rancours.
BRITANNIA must own with Punch that 'tis on such
questions as this of Education, whose habitat should lie
above the zone of party tempests and tornadoes, that her
Lords show to advantage over her Commons.
(Commons.)—Another post-mortem examination, of the
Suez-Canal Shares-Purchase, in Committee on the Bill
to raise the money. MR. Low>: poked up the CHANCELLOR
OF THE EXCHEQUER, and MK. RYLANDS rasped out a
screed of his familiar penny-wisdom. But the House
was too languid to feel either the chafe of cynic blister-
ointment or the burden of Rylandsian boredom.
"Not a ha'porth 'twould reck, though it let them talk on,
And e'en DIZZY in duLuetB arraj ed him."
Even when RYLANDS accused the Government of
haviag formed something very like a ring to "rig"

Egyptian Stock, the House could hardly be roused to sympathise with
SIB STAFFORD'S virtuous indignation. It was too hot even for
personalities. Everybody felt that somehow there had been a coup-
manque here too, as in the Cave Report—a" letting ' I dare not' wait
upon ' I would,'" that indicated the quenching of a sensational coup,
smacking strong of Asiatic mystery, with a douche of caution—
"from DERBY'S depths in cooling fountains drawn." The PREMIER
explained how High Political and Commercial were blent in the
transaction.
High Policy's all very well.
But what both Jew and Gentile essaym,
When loss against gain you 'vc to tell,
IB to prove that High Policy pays.
Appellate Jurisdiction Bill got through Committee, and the die
cast for creation of one-horse legal Peers—not permanent pillars of
the House of Lords, but removable, like the partitions of a royal
box.
Wednesday.—"When the steed is stolen, shut the door. MB.
BOCTBKB informed the House that Her Majesty's Government have
authorised the appointment of a British Consular Officer at Philli-
popolis. so that SIB HENRY ELLIOTT will not be reduced to depend
on Turkish authorities for accounts of Turkish atrocities.
Appellate Jurisdiction Bill passed, under a funeral wail from
MR. WHALLEY, to Ophelia's air:—
"Oh, woe is me!
To hare seen what I have seen, see what I see!"
WHALLEY suggests as subject for a picture—" The Serpent of Sta-
tutory Enactment swallowing the Common Law!"
MR. CROSS, in a speech of infinite tact and discretion, moved the
Bill for regulating Vivisection. About this question England is
divided into two camps: one, which does not need to have reason
urged on it; the other, which refuses to hear reason. The Bill is
an attempt to meet an angry, excited, and, in its stronger forms,
irrational feeling; but respect is due even to the errors of humane
sentiment, however hot and heady. Of the thousand forms in which
man inflicts pain on animals, one is specially inflicted for a holy
purpose — the advancement of knowledge, with a view to the
diminution of suffering. That one form is henceforth to be placed
under special legal regulation. MB. HOLT was the organ of
excited sentiment. SIB JOHN LOTBOCK and DB. PLAYFAIB put the
case for calm science with exemplary moderation; the RIGHT
HON. ROBEBT LOWE, more sup, with more point and pepper than per-
suasiveness. On an ebbing tide Ministers went to dine at Greenwich.
Thursday.—LOBD G. HAMILTON brought in the Indian Budget-
though last, not least—to an Indian audiences-very hot, very
languid, and as little able as willing to brace up its energies to the
terrible feat of facing such a problem as the Depreciation of Silver;
still more, the crux of applying a remedy to it. To talk of Indian
prosperity seems literally surplusage—for in 1874-75, a calculated
deficit of £1,388,000 had been converted into a surplus of £319,197,
and in 1875-76, a calculated surplus of £506,000 had swelled to
£1,634,000. There was an increase in the revenue from Customs,
Stamps, and Railways. Army expenditure had been retrenched.
Public works were being conducted with less waste. All would be
going merry as a marriage bell, but for silver—vile silver—"fans
et origo mali." vice gold superseded. By its depreciation, the Indian
revenue would lose £2,313,000; but " little Surplus "—as CHARLES
STJBFACE says—would survive through all!
LORD G. showed how all the devices proposed for setting up that
Humpty-Dumpty—the fallen Rupee—were impracticable, and an-
nounced that Government was prepared to do nothing but keep its
eyes open and curtail public works. Manchester, through the sweet
voices of SIDKBOTTOM, BBIGGS, and BIBLEY, advocated repeal of the
Duties on Calico, to the tune of "Take the Goods our Mills provide
you," instead of weaving for yourselves, and putting on our wares a
duty which, with their ownsi'z«, is quite heavy enough to swamp Man-
chester cloths. Manchester could supply grey shirtings of any quan-
tity as well as any size, if the Indian Government would take off
the duty.
The House went into Committee after MESSES. GOSCHEN AND Fxw-
CETT had delivered learned essays on the Economics of Silver.
Punch can't understand its depreciation—he never appreciated
half-crowns more since he can remember.
Friday.—ENGLAND washes her hands clean of responsibility for
Turkish blood and filth. MR. EVELYN ASHLEY and SIR W. HAB-
COFRT found eloquent voice for the feeling of horror and repulsion
which the Bulgarian atrocities have left through the length and
breadth of the land.
Turkey, as the Times truly says, has forfeited for ever the good
opinion of England. It is Well that MB. DISBAELI, who, with MR.
BOTTBKE, did his best in palliation of the supineness of our repre-
sentative at Constantinople, should understand this clearly; and it
is well that England by her Collective Wisdom should have spoken
so strongly and so clearly as Parliament is breaking up.
As Members dispersed in the small hours a rumour swept
through the benches, and made the lights burn for a moment
dimmer—that the Commons will know The RIGHT HONOURABLE
BENJAMIN DISBAELI no more, he having been called up to the House
of Lords as EABL OF BKACONSFIELD—
Leaving his brightest Beacon's wider field,
That House of Commons, where, for forty yen™,
His ready tongue hath been both sword and shield,
In battle with t!ic worthiest uf his peers.
It is the season of falling stars—a bright one has shot sudden from

Swells on the pier, and 'Aiutv on the beach,

For folly is more hard to cure than crime.

Leatherstock. Beastly bad, Sir, beastly bad. Glad to see you out

Flintlock. It's against my Doctor's orders, but I thought I would
come down to the Club to have a look at the papers.
Leatherstock. Hang the papers, Sir! They are the curse of the
country!
Flintlock. What's all this about retirement, LEATHEBSTOCK?
Leatherstock. Capital notion, Sir—best thing they have done for
many a year. They want to retire the Company Officers.
Flintlock (anxiously). They won't touch us Generals?
Leatherstock. Touch us, Sir P I should like to see them do it!
Hang it! there's another of my twinges! Touch us, indeed! The
Service would have come to a pretty pass if they touched us!
[They hobble up the steps of the Club.
SCENE— Outside the Junior. COLONEL TAPE and MAJOR DOCKET

Tape. Hallo, DOCKET! Up in town again?
Docket. Yes. I am still a supernumerary. Just been appointed
to the Pen-Cutting Department.
Tape. I congratulate you. A very snug post, indeed.
Docket. And you, Colonel?
Tape (laughing). Oh, I am as lucky as ever—still on the Staff. I
do believe, DOCKET, I couldn't pass an examination in Field Exer-
cises, Part I. I haven't opened the book for years!
Docket. No more have I, Colonel. This Staff work makes a
fellow precious rusty. "What do you think of this .Retirement

Tape. It seems sensible — making the Captains and Subalterns
resign, and leaving us alone. Couldn't have anything better than
that, eh?

Braid. My dear old man, you are an honour to the Service.
Orderly. The Service be hanged, Sir!

Orderly. I have changed my opinion. How e»n a man take a
pride in his profession w_hen he is to be shunted after twenty years'
service? After undergoing all the drudgery of a Company Officer,

Braid. I see you have been reading the Retirement affair. It is
rather rough.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE AT THE GREAT "WAGNER
FESTIVAL, BAYBEUTH.
117, Schnitzelstrasse, Saireuth.
MEIN LIKI! ALTS MAfT.f,
DA bin ich! Und Sie wie bejinden Sie sich t Das Wetter
ist gut fur scktoachliche Leute. Excuse dest German sprechen.
aber (but) when I am once again among mein intimer freunde and
mein alten Fallen I cannot avoid thinking in their language, and
so slipping into it. I suppose you know all about Baireuth, or Bay-
reuth, but "Bai" is the proper way of buchstabiren (spelling) it.
I '11 just give you such partickuldren as 1 've been able to pick up
in the few hours I 've been here.
The population yesterday was 19,208, but I have since learnt that
this morning, before sending this, it has been increased by twins at
No. 20, Kinderstrasse, when die muter und dese kinchen (this is low-
Bavarian for "mother and children") are doing as well as can be
expected. Dear old WAGGY (my petit nom, for years past, for mein
intimer freund HERB WAGNER) leaves a note at the house—every
morning, and such a note!!—it expresses, at one Wagnerian touch,
his deep sympathy, the height of his anxiety, his sharpness to be
of any service, his intention to call again to-morrow, and his wish
to stand godfather to these little twins, who, because it is here the
custom to be perpetually drinking babies' healths, and because the
new-born ones themselves in this country take to "the bottle" BO
early, are called die Ztoittings—and a doosid good name, too.
There is a splendid pompe (pump) at Bayreuth; a fine restaurant,
where we drink schloss* (a sort of thick lager-beer stirred up with a
spoon), and eat der schwein-choppen (pork chops) stewed in sauer-
krout (sour crout); and, danke Jfimmel, in this hot weather there
are lots of schwizzle-hausen all over the place.
There is here the National German Operatic Theater, which mein
lieb alte freund WAGGY drew out himself from the original design of
a certain gentleman whom it would not become me to mention; but,
* Se/ilots we had hitherto thought meant, in German, a castle. Still, there
may be a drink of that name, just as, eg., we say here " Give me a pint of
Baas," meaning thereby a pint of the beer brewed by MR. BASS, M . I'. Also
we refuse to accept the responsibility of our esteemed Correspondent's Bavarian
spelling. He is evidently intimately acquainted with various dialects, and
with the Bavarian cockneyisms of the streets, as he employs words and
expressions which, we confess, are utterly strange to us. Yet as it has not
been our fortunate lot, as we gather from occasional remarks in his present
letter it has been his, to be brought up at Heidelberg and Bonn, and to be on
most intimate and alfectionate terms with Germans and Austrians and
Bavarians of all ranks, we will not venture to correct his spelling or his
translations, and can only congratulate ourselves and our readers on being
able to receive information from so invaluable a Contributor, who is no less
erudite as a scholar than he is accomplish! d as a gentleDian, and who is able
to live most economically in a foreign country, as a true Cosmopolitan should
do.—ED.

another's chceken (cheeks), with that expansion and
effusion of affection which only two such old chvm-
nen-und-pallen (equivalent to "college and schpol-
'ellows") as old HEBE WAGGY and myself could possibly
experience. Bang went the drums, clash went the cymbals,
which der Meister (the master) had thoughtfully provided
x) divert public attention from us as we wept, aroppen-
die-joien (tears of joy); over each other's shoulder.
"Was wunschen Ste ?" were the first words he could
alte mann, you will comprehend when I remind you that Your Representative
was educated for an Architect,* in which line I should have undoubtedly
excelled, had not mv modesty and unselfishness . . . But I am not here to
write my memoirs. These will come iu good time.
We are living at a charming boarding-house near the Black Forest. You
have often heard of the Boarders of the Black Forest, eh? "Well, that's where
we are.t
In the morning it is delightful to hear the warbliing of the birds, the shreiken
of the night owl, the wild wood notes of the cockaleeken, the chirrupen of the
cocktilqllen-biird, and the bumbelen (humming) of a myriaden der insekten (of
a myriad insects—this is all low-Bavarian, the language here of the family
circles), which are in themselves a rare education for the neophyte who
would unterkiinsttimbiilen (understand) the genius of mein lieb alte WAGGY.
Our meeting at the station was immensely touching—we were in each
* "An Architect." This is news: but nothing surprises us, as we always told him to
hit face that he was a very clever man.—ED.
t We have heard of the "border? of the Black Forest," but not of a boarding-house in
that romantic spot. If our Contributor is joking with us, it is a pity, as, with this vague
address, it is impossible for us, with any degree of security, to forward him the "de quoi
vivre," in point of fact the usual honorarium for expenses. This, however, causes us little
or no anxiety, as our esteemed Representative, being such a master of languages, and being
so well known to the renowned Miicstro, HEKR WAONEH himself (whom he calls " Old
WAOOY," as we learn from his letter), will never be at a loss, should our handsome
remittance fail to arrive, as it certainly will do on the present occasion. We think it due
to ourselves to mention our reason for not posting the remittance, publicly beforehand, so as
to forestall any subsequent reprisals and complaints on the part of our esteemed Corre-
spondent. [Also, if he is on the borders of the Black Forest, why does ho date from
117, Schnitzelstrasse, which street we have been utterly unable to find in our plan ol
B:iyreuth, which, however, we will honestly admit, is an old copy of ten years ago. Yet it
is odd.—ED.]
I replied,glibly, "Geben Sie mir etwas Wein etwas
Ochsbraten, etwas Salat, eine halbe Taube, dot Oel,
etwas Spinat, einen Hecht, eine Pfersiche und eine
Flasche moussirenden Champagner."*
In a second, it was before us.
"Zo ist gut.'" I exclaimed. "A"«» danke sie
Himmel! Ja! Zo!"
We are having a first-rate time of it. Such a party
ast night. Myself the life and soul of it of course. It
was musical and merry. Waggish and Wagnerian! I
slayed my Leatherlungcn with a trilogy in 6 minor,
which they had never heard before.
"If," said old WAGGY, emphatically, "if that sym-
phony grand-and-heart-and-soul-interior-stirring this
;ime I before had heard, never again of music a note
would I myself have written!"
And for three minutes he was silent, huried in deep
;hought. I tapped him on the backt and whispered in
lis ear, "Lieb Meister" I said, "the idea is yours. Take
it and be happy." He was overjoyed and immediately
went into his bedroom to re-toucb. the Nibelungen, which
:s taken from an unpublished work of mine, Die Nibberto-
latetomenden, libretto by CHABLES READE.t
Our party consisted of the KING OF BAVABIA, who has
still some good notes in his voice, only he will take too
much stodgen-sassinger (a sort of delicate sausage made
of boar's flesh, truffles, garlic, veal, and underdone
beef), at dinner, three Serene Transparencies, who quite
lighted up during the evening, though a trifle dull at
first, four Grand Dukes, and six Grand Duchesses, who
sang a decemtette in b flat of the musiken der Zimmer
order, with much taste and feeling.
Then we had three ordinary Dukes, who mishehaved
themselves shockingly, and who were subsequently re-
moved to die station-hauser by the Bobben-politzei (con-
stabulary), and were not let on next morning until they
had paid a fine, two-and-a-half silber groschen each,
which was ordered by the wiirthe-beke (Magistrate) to be
placed in the poor's-box.
The EMPEROB OF AUSIBIA sang his own hymn, accom-
panying himself on the concertina, very fairly for an
amateur, only he will overdo the action, and get so
much all obcr-die-schoppen (all over the shop), that
there's no coming within a mile of him. I am out-
running my space, so must finish, but not without telling
you a few of my splittersideren (or jokes that nearly
make you burst with laughter), with which I have en-
livened the company in this out-of-the-way-but-at-
present-fashionably, scientifically, operatically, and ar-
tistically-crowded place.
All our jokes and conversation are musical, bien
entendu.
Here is a specimen of a few of my crakiiiken, as the
Swedes call them—of my funnimentos, as the Spaniards
have it.
A friend who is just off to the Continent with his pocket full
of Hfurrays, Bradshaws, and Conversation books, has just this
minute looked in. He declares that every word or this excellent
German is to be found in a Manual of Conversation for the
Traveller, under the head of Das Abendessen. Yet, on second
thoughts, why shouldn't it be? Our Correspondent would cer-
tainly not ask HERR WAGNER for dishes which were not in the
language of the country. Of course, it i» as well to be cautious;
but we are inclined to think that our visitor (who has gone)
was a trifle hypercritical. The question to our mind is, does
Our Correspondent really speak low-Bavarian dialects or not f
If he does . . . yet, tttll, ne may have recourse to his Con-
versation book for his best German. We will think it out, and
while thinking it out, we can temporarily withhold remit-
tances.—ED.
t No, we never did hear of this. Why has this work been BO
long hidden away? We can hardly believe it: and yet,— we
will write to MR. CHARLES READE, and put the matter in his
hand*. If the statement is untrue, MR. READE can put the en-
gine of the law at work, and ho may depend upon us for giving
him every assistance in our power.—ED.

"A1AEUMS, EXCURSIONS!"
Shakspeare.
THB Collision Season has set in early; and if all
excursion-trains are to be managed on the same prin-
ciples as that which travelled over the Somerset and
Dorset Railway on Monday week (Bank Holiday), a con-
siderable addition to the death rate may be confidently
anticipated. Could not the infliction on readers of the
daily journals of column after column of solemn and pro-
tracted farces, called "Official Inquiries," be dispensed
with for a common form, agreed upon by the Board of
Trade? It could easily be done. Everybody knows that—
1. A nervous Coroner will open " this painful investi-
gation."
2. That a person with the appearance of being pos-
sessed of unfathomable wisdom will "act as Assessor"
(whatever that may mean), and, with great prudence,
say as little as possible.
3. That another person, also, supposed to possess
inscrutable knowledge with regard to Railway accidents
(after they have occurred), will altend as "Government
Inspector. This will probably be a Military man—a
familiarity with lists ot "killed and wounded," being
no doubt considered the moat essential qualification.
4. A Jury, of various degrees of ignorance, will view
the bodies and the scene of the accident with open-
mouthed astonishment.
5. Plans and Models will be produced, a large number
of witnesses will flatly contradict one another, and a
quantity of the most intricate engineering technicalities
will be flashed to and fro before the bewildered Jury.
8. The Rules of the Company, printed for the use of
their servants and employes, will be produced, and proved
to be so perfect and so full of ibrexight, that their obser-
vance must have made the accideut impossible. Only
one point will not be insisted upon—that the require-
ments of the Company, as to time and taskwork, render
the observance of these Rules by their overworked ser-
vants absolutely impossible; dismissal being the sure
consequence of the servants' observance of anv rule that
happens for the moment to be in the teeth of an official
superior's order.
7. The Coroner will deliver a hazy " summing' up."
8. The Jury, probably, after asking the Coroner what
verdict they ought to return, will find that there is no-
body to blame; or if there is a scapegoat to be pounced
upon, that it is some poor devil who works some hundred
and twenty hours a week for sixteen shillings.
9. Coroner, Jury, Inspector, and Assessor will com-
pliment one another on the attainment of that pitch of
intelligence known in jury records as " high," and such
an amount of amiability as to render it almost a pity
they should ever part.
10. Some months after the accident is forgotten by
the public, the Inspector will make a "Report" to the
Board of Tr.ide, which, after dealing very elaborately
with the facts of the case, will wind up with some very
valuable suggestion which has bet-n offered fifty times
before, and as often disregarded by the Company.
Punch has a suggestion to make in addition to the
hint that " Inquiries" might be reduced to a common
form; and that is, that whenever it may seem necessary
that two trains shall meet on a single line, the passen-
gers and officials may be allowed to alight a few minutes
before the desired collision. Then, a full head of nteam
being turned on, let the two trains have it out without
the passengers.

SAUSAGE MAKERS AND SAUSAGE MILLS.
Ox the Bank Holiday, Monday last week, the brightness of the
sky was as remarkable as the dulness of the papers, only enlivened by
the subjoined police case; and the interest of that is melancholy:—
"At Brentford, JAMES PEEK, a pork butcher and aausage maker in an
extensive way of business at Brentford, was charged on a warrant with
having on his premises, for the purpose of manufacture into human food,
upwards of a quarter of a ton of putrid meat. Mu. WOODBRIDOE prosecuted
for the Brentford Local Board. MR. G. W. LAY (LAY Ann SCOTT) defended.
The defendant was sentenced to three months' hard labour."
A pork butcher and sausage maker in an extensive way of business
must command the sympathy of all who respect respectability.
Another good man gone wrong f It is awful to imagine a most well-to-
do shopkeeper employed in picking oakum or sinking under the toil-
some effort of climbing the treadmill. Sadder still is the fact
that a tradesman so respectable as one late in business at Brent-
ford on a scale amounting to extensive, should have had so little
self-respect as to incur the correction of a common rogue. But the
saddest thought of all is, that of the extent to which sausages in
the extensive business of this Brentford sausage maker have been
probably composed of putrid meat, and the quantity of measly and
otherwise diseased pork with which it may be feared, this pork
butcher of Brentford has been supplying the Brentford, and, perhaps,
even the British Public. Let us hope that his example will operate
as a warning to the generality of pork butchers and sausage makers,
whether their way of business be extensive or restricted. Or else,
some of them likewise may be condemned to the treadmill, and
retributively utilised in grinding wholesome sausage meat.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

RE the Ends of Sessions (as the late BENJAMIN DISRAELI assured us
the other day) really fertile in compromises? Is this weather
(Saturday, August 12) a compromise?—or the last tierce fight
over the Education Bill ?—or this day's mutiny of JENKINS and DUKE against
the majesty of the Chair—two small talkers against the Great Speaker ?—or this
wail of WHALLET'S over the gradual downfall, at the hands of Parliament, of
the Common Law, and the recklessness of reporting in the small hours ?—or this
last assault of the Ship-owners on the Lords' Amendments of the Merchant
Shipping Bill, and PLTMSOLL'S final protest?
Surely not. The Session dies (Monday) not quietly like a good man in the
evening of his days, after a well-spent life, but fiercely in fight and foam, like
a whale in its flurry—amidst obtestation of Lords, forced to accept Commons'
Amendments undiscussed, and Commons, compelled to bolt Lords' Amendments
undigested: and angry interchange of Lords' Amendments of Commons' Amend-
ments of Lords' Bills.—and Commons' Amendments of Lords' Amendments of
Commons' Bills—all alike in the rough and unconsidered state in which they are
passed into Law—and a general hustling and hurrying, bustling and worrying
through Third Reading of the laggard Bills of the Session.
But all 'B well that ends well. They are all at last through the perilous passage of the Twelfth, so big with the fate of birds that it
has no room for care about the fate of Bills; and (Tuesday, Aug. 15) THE SESSION HAS BEACHED ITS CLOSE!
When the House meets again, it will know the EIGHT HON. BENJAMIN DISBAELI no more—but, in another place, the KARL OP
BEACONSFTELD; to whom Punch, with pen and pencil, pays, in this Number, his due tribute of honour.
And so the Session with a Title ends,
That with a Title ope'd; but how unlike
This Title unto that! This Title given,
TTngrudged and uncontented, unto one
Whom, howsoever differing men and minds
May differ in their judgment of the man,
All own a fit
The meed or honour which now crowns his age:
Like some great argosy, that after years
Of buffetting with winds and waves and ware,
Crowned with the memories of conflicts past,
Passes from high seas' strife to harbour's calm.
That Title, hardly forced at the sword's point.
From England's grudging throat—for that her
life
Of loyalty would none of a new name
For the old majesty of England's Queen,
Law-based, Law-consecrate, and Law-enthroned!
reasonable inference that agricultural pursuits are as much in favour
in the Moon as they have been from time immemorial on our own
planet. It would be interesting to know whether wheat and barley
and wild oats ripen as well under moonshine as they do under sun-
shine; what description of implements our neighbour's farmers
employ, and whether they still stick to the sickle; and what diffi-
culties they have, with ground game, and whether they are in
the habit of grumbling about the seasons, the crops, and the
of the Grand Duchess to one of our important Cattle Parades, the ' times.
LUNAR FARMING.
IT is rather surprising that the somewhat unusual occurrence of
an inhabitant—a very distinguished one, it would seem—of the
Moon payinga. visit to our Earth should not have attracted more
attention. We refer to the "GRAND DUCHESS DE LUNE," who is
reported as having been present at the Northumberland Agricultural
Society's Show. Astronomers cannot fail to deduce, from this visit

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHERE TO GO.
O Aix-la- Cha-
pelle. If you are
disappointed with
life, and wish to
experience dul-
ness in all its
native purity. If
you have no ob-
jection to suicide,
drink the waters.
To Boulogne.
If you love to
hear French
spoken as it is at
Putney. If rink-
ing (with the sun
at 80° in the re-
frigerator) is a
pleasant distrac-
tion. If you like
"Porto" with a
very strong bou-
quet.
To Canter-
bury. If you are
fond of cricket,
cathedrals, and
amateur theatri-
cals. Of course, if yon find the city is too livelv, you can make
an excursion to Herne Bay the Hilarious, ortoBroadstairs, the birth-
place of Broad Grins.
To Dieppe. If you like your wife to dress six times a day. If
you don't mind the passage from Newhaven. If you wish your
children to pick up the French tongue with a slight Billingsgate
(adapted from the English) flavour.
To Ems. If you delight in listening to anecdotes about German
Royalty, and do not object to paying regal prices for your board
and lodging at the leading hotels.
To Folkestone. If the arrival of the boat from Boulogne on a
rough day is an attraction to you. If you are fond of the society of
Aldershott-by-the-Sea.
To Graresend. If your soul does not soar above shrimps, "happy
days" at Rosherville, and sixpences extra for hot water and weak
tea.
To Hammersmith. If you are passionately attached to the
Metropolitan and District Railways, and have a sneaking liking for
Shepherd's Bush.
To Interhcken. If you wish to watch the manners and customs
of those who avail themselves of "Tourist Tickets" and "Hotel
Coupons," and like your English without the letter H.
To Jersey. If yon want to see a place where England is con-
sidered a " sister island," and where a French-speaking race would
certainly not be English, if by any change in their nationality they
could avoid becoming French.
To Kiel. If the birth-place of the German Navy interests you,
and you like a watering-place governed from Berlin.
To Lucerne. If you don't want to lose sight of the long-familiar
faces of London. If you delight to hear BROWN'S attempts at French,
and SMITH'S attacks upon German. If you appreciate a good dinner
at the Schweitzerhoff.
To Monaco. If you consider it the thing to meet the "lucky
men " of the Clubs, the beardless Subalterns of the crack Cavalry
regiments, and the younj Ladies who are going to belong to PRINCE'S
the moment they have kissed hands at Court.
To Naples. If yon like to be hot and are partial to macaroni. If
you have never seen Vesuvius and think it advisable to supplement
the knowledge you have attained in the Courts of the Crystal Palace
with an excursion to Pompeii.
To Ostend. If you really want a good, dull, dirty town—to get
away from. If an overdressed crowd of cosmopolitans is a pleasing
sight to you.
To Paris. If you do not mind sunstroke, cheap tourists, and old
pieces. If you want to prove to your own satisfaction that the
celebrated saying should be altered to " Only bad Americans go to
Paris in August, when they die."
To Quebec. If you are not particularly popular and wish to give
your friends at home a little holiday by your absence.
To Rotterdam. If you enjoy a long sea journey and are never so
happy as when you are staying at damp hotels and meeting dull-
looking people.
To Scarborough. If you are fond of adaptations from the French
and wish to see Boulogne, plus Margate, Brompton, Sheffield, and
Upper Tooting, settled noisily down upon the coast of Yorkshire.
To Torquay. If you consider yourself an invalid and wish to
behave as such.
To Vienna. If you want to see life, and are fond of beer that
frequently cheers and only occasionally inebriates.
To Waterloo. If you are staying at Brussels, and don't mind
travelling in company with " 'Amir and his friend " "ENERY."
To Xeres. If you have only tasted doctored sherry and wish to
drink the genuine article.
To Yarmouth. If you have a fond devotion for bloaters and
desire to buy some of an inferior quality to those only to be obtained
in London.
To Zanzibar. If you arc a good-natured fellow, and don't mind
going a short journey to say " How d'ye do ?" to the SULTAN for his
dear friend (and yours too, if you like), Mr. Punch.
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
Through Journey—Express—Boat—Notes on Anticipations—
Arrival.
Happy TJinught.—OS!
Fellow-passenger in train, who talks to me for half-an-hour
under the impression that everybody must be going, as he is, to the
Chester Races. Finding that I am not bound for that sporting
meeting, and that, moreover, I am personally unacquainted with
any Winner of the Derby within the last five years, and that I have
no "fancy" for the "Thousand Guineas," or something of that
sort, at Newmarket, he loses all interest in me, and, pulling a cap
over his ears, and wrapping his long, light, check-patterned Ulster
over his legs, he is off to sleep. No other passengers. Quick, easy-
going train this!
At Crewe.—After we have waited here a few minutes, Guard
asks, "Any more Irish train'( " as if we were a dish, like Irish stew.
It beinp ascertained that no one (at Crewe, at least) does want any
more Irish train, they get rid of us as quickly as possible. Again
it urges on its mild career.
Through Wales. Wales fast asleep. Welsh moonlight. Subject
for Academy picture. No. 289, " Welsh Mutton asleep in Welsh
Moonlight" by Miss ELIZABETH THOMPSON, a PSACS offering to the
Academy. Wonder'what the passage across will be like. Wonder
if it will be worse than I anticipate. No; it can't be worse. I have
heard they are magnificent boats. My only idea of a "magnificent"
boat, is [one in which you cannot feel the movement when it is in
motion.
"Impossible!" says some one. "Not at all!" I reply. "Isn't
the world moving round and round, in the giddiest possible manner,
perpetually? and do we feel the motion f No." Let a scientific
person think this out, and construct a new packet-boat for the
Channel.
On Board.—It is a fine vessel—that is, as to size and accommoda-
tion. Steward (Irish, of course) most polite. He shows me to a
cupboard, fitted up with shelves on which to put passengers away.
This cabin recalls to my mind the horrors of the Antwerp passage on
board the gallant Baron Osy. Passengers are drinking and eating.
Happy Thought.—Don't look at them. Shut myself into cup-
board, and play at going to bed, as if I were still on shore, or stay-
ing (I will suppose) with a bachelor friend'who could only give me a
shake-down. . . . I begin by " making believe " with the foregoing
idea in view. ... I change it to playing at beinjf asleep on a sofa
in a badly-built house during a gale. . . . This ingenious notion
will sufficiently account for the sound of the cracking of the timbers,
and the undulating movement of the couch (not a bed or a sofa noir)
and the noise outside. ... As the noise outside increases, I have to
add " the water coming in," and imagine myself in a London house
on a Monday morning, in bed in some room near the tank when
"the water comes in." . . . Now I will play at going to sleep. . . .
* * * * ' * *
If sleep won't come—out, out, brief note-book.
******
A novelist writes, "But lot us not anticipate "-Tsay, "Let
me anticipate; let me imagine what Ireland is going to be like,
according to my idea." My preconceived notions of Ireland are
founded chiefly upon the admirable writings of the late MR. CHARLES
LEVER, illustrated by " PHIZ," with occasional assistance from the
HALLS, the O'HARAS, WILLIAM CARLETON, and the Irish plays of
MESSRS. F.U.COXER and BOUCIC.VITLT.
On landing I expect to be hailed by ragged car-boys in long coats
with capes to them, with battered hats on their heads, chiefly re-
markable for the scarcity of brim, the absence of crown, and for
the presence of a " dhudeen " (perhaps this is not the way to spell it,
but I mean a short black pipe) stuck in, anyhow, when not in use.
I expect to be styled "Captain!" by every one of these raga-
muffins (Note—for when I 've time to think of it—whence the word,
"Rag-a-muffin "? A muffin done to rags doesn't suggest the
idea. Keep this for Typical Developments, Letter " R,"—" unde

or some rascal more powerful than the others, collars my port
manteau, puts it on his car, and perhaps collars me (for I shouldn'
resist " Black MULLENS "), and puts me on to the car too.

way and that, my stick, my umbrella, my hatbox, and my overcoat
to the twenty-four winds of heaven, and to the intense enjoymen
of the hundred or more laughing, running, vagabonds about the place
This is the sort of entry—hardly a triumphal one—that I expec
into Dublin; founded, of course, on my recollections of Charle
O'Malky and Jack Hinton the Guardsman.
"What do I expect of Dublin P Well, principally the LORD LIEU
TENANT driving about, plenty of military, always in uniform,
sprinkling of attorneys, lots of "Counsellors" in wig and gown
fine policemen, jovial-looking priests, priggish-looking parsons

windows, and, at every turn of the streets, some lazy, idle dog
saying good things to some other lazy, idle joker like himself, whil
the car-drivers keep up a fire of running chaff all over the town
That is what I am expecting. I am further expecting to be in
readiness at any moment with a repartee. And I am arranging m'
course of conduct so as not to be the aggressor in a verbal war o
wit, but either to smile goodhumouredly and bear it, or, if ready
to reply and turn the laugh in my favour.
As for .Trinity College, I expect to find the Undergraduates in
the evening giving their wine and supper parties, playing the
cornet-a-piston out of tune, blowing up the College pump, squib-
ting a Dean, or indulging in some other good old practical joke

a strong enough -word for my purpose: it is too weak, childish, anc
lamblike. A lamb frolics, an Irishman "rollicks." "Well, this is
what I expect; and I am glad 1 have written it down, so as to be
able to compare the reality with what my fancy (founded on Irish
works of Irish imagination) had painted it. Nous terrons.

"Ten minutes more, Sir," says the Steward, looking in, "and we
shall be in."
Happy Thought.—Thank Heaven! I hare slept.
11 suppose," says the Steward, looking in again, "ye '11 want a
boy.
I am half asleep. Is it a boy, or a buoy, he means? Why

Sappy Thought.—To answer, as if I were an old traveller, and
quite accustomed to it, " Certainly."
The " boy " appears, and carries my luggage with the strength of
three boys.
GENTLEMAN HELP.
AN Advertisement in a daily paper offers a good opening for any
one of too many of our young friends:—
YOUTH (Genteel) WANTED at Builder's Office, and assist in house
early morn, clean knives, boots, and run errands. Good opportunity to
learn.—Apply, &c.
This is really the only sort of thing that numbers of well-looking
boys, sons of poor gentlefolk, are fit for, whilst their parents and
friends are vainly striving to obtain them employment requiring
educated intelligence. The expectations cherished in such cases
might be truly expressed by advertisement, as follows:—" Wanted,
by Parents moving in good Society, but of narrow means, a Gentle-
manly and Lucrative Situation for a Youth of rudimentary Know-
ledge, and of Abilities below the Average."
An Irish Gem.
^s one of some letters exchanged with ME. GLADSTONE, on the
I'niversitv question, an "IRISH CATHOLIC LAYMAN," having ex-
pressed the nope that his correspondent will one day resume the
Premiership, concludes his letter as follows :—
"When the time for taking that position arrives, your old and grateful
Hend» in Ireland will prove to the world that Irish Catholics are never
ingratcful, and that honesty of purpose, even when directed against what they
mid most dear, cannot blot from their memory past favours.''
But is it from any but an Irish memory, sure, that honesty of
jurpose, in any case, could possibly blot past favours?

TOWN-TOURING.
H. COOK has had it al
his own way for somi
years of excursion -
eering. Mr. Punch
has almost made up
his mind (the lat<
heat having renderec
it almost impossible
to make up anything
else—even the cur-
rent Number) to sel
on foot an under-
taking which is cal-
culated to meet the
wishes and purses oi
a large circle oi
would-be travellers.
The title, "The
Economical Station-
ary Tourists' So-
ciety," has nothing
to do with cheap
envelopes and writing
paper; but it is the
most compendious
designation of Jfr.
Punch's eminently
logical scheme to supply those who, by circumstances beyond their
own control, are forced to remain in the Metropolis during the
;ravelling season.
Tickets will be delivered, at various prices, for the various desti-
nations of purchasers anxious to travel without leaving home. The
rooms in the Society's Establishment will be numbered and named
according to the Tours undertaken by the Managers.
For instance: You purchase a ticket for the Tyrol. All you have
0 do is to look at the plan of the Rooms kept by the Porter. You
will follow the passage indicated, conducting you to a door labelled
Tyrol. Within you will find maps, handbooks, and photographs
of all the objects of interest in the Austrian or Italian Tyrol.
Specimens of Edelweiss and pear-wood chamois, chalets, and alpen-
stocks, may be purchased at a stall in the room. Ladders will be
>royided to mount on to the roof with the greatest possible danger
a life and limb; while blocks of Wenham ice and property snow—
n lambs' wool—will be added, to give local colour to the ascent.
A Courier, of competent experience and rascality, will be attached
a each Tour. Mattrasses on the roof, for sunrises, extra.
The Egyptian Tour will provide models of a Nile Boat and a
iving crocodile in a tank. Mosquitoes will be let out at night to
nterprising sleepers on the premises. A real Dragoman will be
attached to this department, and cartes de visite of the KHEDIVE and
M. DE LESSEPS will be kept in stock.
In the Indian Tour Room will be exhibited the Basket Trick, and
1 snake-charmer, with a live cobra. Permission has been secured to
ide the Elephants at the Zoological Gardens. Negotiations are
lending for a Rajah with a grievance.
In the Garden at the back. Grouse recently killed may be shot at,
nd sent to friends on the following morning.
Time and experience will bring the idea to perfection; but
Mr. Punch is confident that the speculation is fraught with the
appiest prospects for his own pocket, and the pleasure of intending
ourists, of wide ambitions and narrow means.
"Caviare to the General."
WE rarely meet a soldier without hearing some complaint about
ie small pay he is getting. Still, we must say we are startled by
ie following advertisement:—
WANTED, a PLAIN COOK. Wages, £16; all found. A good
GENERAL would suit.
Really, such an offer is an insult to the Army, and the Horse
minis ought to notice it. However paltry he may deem the pay
e is receiving, surely no good General would consent to an exchange
rhich would make him leave the Service for the place of a Plain
ook.
An Object of Suspicion.
TOURISTS in Scotland, who are of confirmed temperate habits, and
able to be shocked by any appearance of excess, would do well to
void Loch Drunkie— at least until a scientific analysis of its con-
ents has satisfied them that there is no Whiskey mingled with the
ater. (N.B.—Loch Drunkie is not to be confounded with Loch
randy. Why is there no Loch Whiskey in Scotland ?)

YOUTHFUL RESOURCE.
MR. AND MRS. JONES HAVE BROKEN IT GENTLY TO THEIR CHILDREN THAT THERE WILL BE NO SEA-SIDE THIS YEAR UNLESS THEY
LET THEIR HOUSE. THE JUVENILE POWERS AVAIL THEMSELVES OF A SHORT ABSENCE OF MR. AND MRS. JONES FIIOM HOME, TO TAKE
THE CASE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS.
A DEEAM, AND ITS FULFILMENT.
The RIGHT HONOURABLE BENJAMIN DISRAELI, EAEL OP BEACOXS-
FIELD, August 12, 1876.
Or what dreams that weird-looking articled clerk,
At his dull office-desk, in the Old Jewry's shade?
Sallow-checked, sable-curled, with strange depths in the dark
Of an eye where the watch-fires for lighting are laid.
Does he dream, o'er the hieroglyphs scrawled on his pad—
While the papers, his work, lie uncared-for hard by—
Of some fabulous fortune, achieved by a lad;
Of millions made his, in the turn of a die?
Or of Fashion's fair houris, in stately saloons,
Pressing Pleasure's drugg'd cup to his feverish lips?
Of luxury's revel in high summer noons,
And passion's fierce frenzy, and swooning eclipse?
Or of Fame, with a trumpet and evergreen crown.
The spoils of that pen? ta'en, sword-fashion, in hand?
Of poet s, romancer's, historian's renown,
And a name that amongst the Immortals shall stand?
Or of prize higher, harder—of power o'er men,
In strife of the Senate by eloquence won;
By wisdom in Council; by eagle-like ken
When the stroke should be struck, how the deed should be done?
Or a far-flashing blaze in which all these combine,
A girandole, bursting in fountains of fire,
Passing colour of flowers and diamonds' shine,
And a voice as of thunder—if quick to expire?
******
The stripling has dreamed, and the young man has dared:
He has reached a new stage and is dreaming again.
With a cheek deeper lined, and a forehead more bared,
But an eye still as deep, and as busy a brain.
If the wealth he has missed—let it go—in its stead
He has touched his two dream-goals of Fashion and Fame;
Is inscribed in Ton's records—his books bought and read:
A wit and a lion, of Town-note and name!
But the Senate—what's power of pen or of word,
If that triumph, most wooed, is least like to be won?
Shall tough brain have been shield to him. sharp speech his sword,
Thus far to fight upwards, and hero to have done?
The strong will, the clear aim, that have borne him so far,
Must win that last height, or he '11 fall on the field;
Hark, the arrows of scorn, on his helm how they jar,
From his vizor fall blunted, and turn on his shield!
Till scoffers are shamed, and decriers struck dumb,
And voices that hooted as loud in applause:
And the time has arrived that ho told them would come,
When his presence is power, his voice sways a cause:
For his rapier-play has brought chiefs to their knee,
Whose fence has been practised in lives of campaign;
And his strength has re-knit hosts that turned them to fiee,
And led them, new-strengthened, to conquest again.
After forty years' fighting, he steps from the fire,
To the height scarcely scaled in his Old Jewry dream;
Adds a third to his two wreaths of boyish desire,
Though sore set against him the stress of the stream.
And all who can honour pith, patience, and power,
And the strenuous purpose that runs a life through
Like a muscle of iron, are glad of the hour
That sees his hand close on the honour his due!
HINT FOK HOT WEATHER.
Go for your sea-side holiday to a watering-place on the coast of
Ireland. There you will secure the enjoyment of Irish coolness.

A VERTIGO OF WIT.

Dis-
OHHONER MB.
KM: 1,1 that was,
having:, while he
was Mi;. DISRAELI,
been wont to be
popularly andplay-
fufly cafled DIZZY,
his elevation to the
Peerage has neces-
sarily occasioned an
influx of remarks
and queries turning
on the point that,
besides bein£ a di-
minutive, dizzy is
synonymous with
vertiginous. As:—
WU1 the eleva-
tion of SIR STAF-
FORD NORTHCOTE to
the Leadership of
the House of Com-
mons turn his head
and make him
dizzy?
SIR STAFFORD
NOETHCOTE may be
raised to be Leader
of the House of
Commons. Ha, ha!—hut that will not make SIR STAFFORD NORTH-
COTE Dizzr.
Don't we all fear that his elevation will make him dizzy?
Don't we all hope it will make him Dizzr?
A brain with more employment busy
Is like to render NOKTHCOTE dizzy;
But to be seen it yet remains
If he be DIZZY as to brains.
Of course the foregoing wisdom and verse are equally applicable,
in supposed connection with the Conservative Leadership, to MR.
GATHORNE HARDY and MR. CKOSS.
There has also been propounded the suggestion that, having
become LORD BEACONSFIELD, MB. DISRAELI now shines as a beacon
in the field of honour, not, however, that he may warn us from it,
but that he may lead us to it; but this again betrays a perilous
dizziness and confusion of head.
DUE REPRESENTATIVE AT THE GREAT WAGNER
FESTIVAL, BATREUTH.
3fSET LIES ALTE
EVERYTHING going on first rate. Crowded house! Cheers!
tears!! and laughter!!! A sea of fire — delicious idea in this
weather — and a steam-fog, set to music, send the audiences into
ecstasies of convulsive delight.
We 're at it all day. Poor Old BETZ— I made a heap of "funni-
mentos," as the Spaniards say, of "wurd-joken " as we have it in
"Low Bairisch," on his name, which dear WAGGY set to music, and
they are now perhaps among some of the brightest gems in the
Composer's crown, or, rather, in the glorious circlets on his crown.
The theatre is wonderful. The musicianers are invisible. WAGNER
won't appear when called before the curtain, but sits in the
prompter's box, and writes letters to the people in front, telling
them why he objects to come out. I said, "Well, you 've come out
sufficiently strong already," — and one of the Royal Swells, who has
since gone away, has adopted this sidesplitteren as his own. I wish
I could find out which or the Crowned Heads or Archdukes ("they
are so arch, these dukes," as I said to WAGGY, who screamed !) had
appropriated my wittikism (Low Bairisch for a kind of small but
happy joke, much made here), and I 'd send him in my bill, and let
him know something of the law of copyright.
However, as I was saying, poor Old BETZ broke down. We nearly
lost our BETZ: it was almost a case of " BETZ off" on account of the
Dead-Heat of the summer.
A propoi ofjoken and sidesplitteren, and as a proof that mein lieb
altefreund (" mv dear old friend") WAGGY can write lightly when
he likes, I need only cite those two admirable comiken wurken
("comic works"—very like English, isn't it?—this is the Low
Bavarian dialect), with two as good farcical names as were ever
invented by even that rising young dramatist, MR. JOHN MADDISON
MOBTON—whose amusing farce of Sox and Cox will, I predict, yet
make a stir in the world—I mean WAGNER'S (firstly) Siesfnd's
Tod and (secondly) Walkiire (Walker), which latter a less-refined
writer might have been tempted to vulgarise into " Hookey." But
WAGGY takes my advice, and is glad of it.
"Atte Kinchm" (the Low Bavarian for " Old Soy "—much used
in the Forest and the mountains), "Alte Kinchen," says he to me,
pausing, with his pen behind his ear, "shall I call this Walkiire or
Ookef*
I did not hesitate one second. "Walkiire, for choice," I replied,
immediately; "it looks better in print."
o F o paper.
"And now let us drink a glass of rare old Schmutzige Wdsche"
(this is a sort of liquor peculiar to Upper Bavaria, and, taken in
moderation, is really not Dad tipple).*
"Siegfrid's Tod is a beautiful name for a farpe, as good as
John JJobbs, or Our Precious Betsy. You can see it at a glance,
and that's where WAGNUR is so nappy, i.e., in the choice of his
subjects. Of course Tad is the low comedian of the piece: but I
have not time at present to give you the entire plot.t
» • *' • * *
I remain ever
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
• "Schmntxige Wasehe," according to our German Conversation Book,
signifies " dirty linen," though at the same time we are not prepared to deny
either that in " Low Bavarian" it may have some other meaning, or that in
social everyday (reman this may be the favourite name for some pleasant
national beverage. Still it it odd, and the more so because—while we are on
the subject, we may as well be candid and open, for our own sake and that of
our esteemed Contributor—we have received numerous communications con-
cerning our worthy Representative's exhibition of, what fifty-nine out of
sixty of our respected Correspondents are pleased to term, "his miserable
ignorance of the German language." We sincerely hope he will see this, and
crush his accusers at one stroke of his powerful pen, or politely explain (which
will be much the same thing), or admit honestly that he has been in the
wrong. There are these three courses open to him; and his desserts after-
wards. For ourselves (if this meets his eye), we have always expressed our
implicit trust in him, and we rely upon him to trust to implicitly in return.
He will understand what this means when he calls at the Post-Office and does
not receive that letter. One of our Teutonic Correspondents sneers at some
German expressions in Our Representative's last letter but one—expressions
to which, be it remembered, we took exception at the time in an elaborate and,
we venture to say, considering our limited space, an exhaustive foot-note.
We quote genuine portions of one of our Indignant Correspondents' letters:
he writes thus to us—"Sir, a jot de mot is a wortspiel" (for ourselves, we
always said it was; but, in defence of Our Representative, who professes to
write "Low Bavarian dialect," is wortspiel the word he would use? Tout
eat Id). "A portmanteau is not a ' Montelsac/u,' but a Mantelsaek, its plural
is Mantelsaeke." We thought there was something wrong here, but as Our
Representative's spelling of the word might have been the " Low Bavarian"
form, or right according to some other dialect of which we were ignorant (and
he is a very superior man), we felt bound to give him the benefit of the doubt.
Our angry Correspondent, who signs himself " A German," continues, " ' My
good friend' is not 'mein goot freund,' but 'mein guter freund.'" We
thought so! and, on this authority, we will immediately write to Our Repre-
sentative, and tell him we are not to be trifled with. We do not believe he
will have a word to say in his defence on this occasion. Perhaps, however,
as he is a very superior person, he may have been thinking in the diibbel-dutch
language, and this was merely a lapsus calami (slip of the pen). Still, on
the face of it, Er hatte TJnrecht. Our thoroughly-roused Correspondent
continues, " 4.' Wir Sindfertiff' can do without the capital' S,' with a small
's' instead." Our Representative shall be informed of this. We ore not
going to have our pens, ink, and space on paper wasted with capital " S's"
when small ones will do quite as well. Yet, on the other hand, we should be
sorry to interfere with his capital letters. Hoping our justly irate Corre-
spondent, "A German," will excuse this pleasantry, we proceed with "A
German's" invaluable corrections. "6. ' Warblungen WagnersJ for'War-
bling Wagners' is a nonsense,"—that is exactly what struck us at the very
moment; undoubtedly, to quote our German friend's excellent English, " it is
a nonsense "—and we are deeply indebted to our Correspondent" A German"
for pointing out what might have escaped even our penetration. At once we
will write to Our Representative, and tell him that" Warblungen Wagners," if
intended for " Warbling Wagners," is " a nonsense," in which he may indulge
at hit own expense, and not at ours. "A German" then goes on to give us
the words which in his language he considers equivalents of our "warble."
He finishes by recommending Our Representative "to take some finishing
lessons in German quotations," which advice we will forward to him, and
perhaps we may venture to convey to him the hint that " A German," who
is so interested in our Contributor s education, might be inclined to pay for
the lessons suggested (for we shan't do anything of the sort), or togwe them
himself, gratis, to Our Representative on his return from Bayreuth. Perhaps,
after all. "A German's" letter was written with an eye to business; if so,
let the Herr Professor enclose his card of terms for attendance, and we will
take care it is forwarded to Our Representative.
*.* We regret that attention to this Correspondent, which we considered
due to him, to ourselves, and Our Representative, has unavoidably abridged
Our Representative's description of the great Musik-fest.—ED.
t The remainder must stand over till next week. We fancy our Contributor
is wrong as to Siegfrid's Tod being a comic piece of any sort. Siegfrid is
the hero of the great trilogy, isn't he? We speak diffidently, as Our Repre-
sentative, being on the spot, ought to have the best information on the
subject.—ED.

LAW, AND CERTAIN OF ITS LIMBS.
LADY JUSTITIA, with incarnate equity, in the shape of MB. COUNCILLOR PUNCH,
at her elbow as Amicus Curia; held a sort of unofficial Audit, taking, a1
ME. PUNCH'S urgent suggestion, a private review of certain of her public
MH. PUNCH called her attention in the first place to a gentleman of Draconic
aspect as to countenance, and Clerical cut as to attire.
"Who is this Rhadamanthus-like personage ?" inquired JUSTITIA, somewhal
languidly. (The thermometer stood at 120° or thereabouts.)
"This," answered ME. PUNCH, "is the REVEREND BBOWN-RIGGE, J.P., one
of the Great Unpaid, whose unbought services in the administration of—
ahem!—Justice reflect so much credit upon your functions—and his own."
"So queer a compound of sleekness and severity," qtioth JUSTITIA, "I think ]
have never seen. Pray what is his speciality as a gratuitous purveyor o:
Justice?"
"Herodian compassion for youth and' ignorance," answered ME. PUNCH,
"is one of his more marked peculiarities. If within his jurisdiction a chile
should chance to pluck an unpermitted flower or purloin an unguarded but for-
bidden faggot, his peculiarities in this regard are speedily manifested to an
admiring world."
"How, pray?" inquired JUSTITIA.
"In the form," responded ME. PUNCH, "of such mild and merciful penaltiei
as personal correction of a Squeersian kind, administered preferably by his own
holy hands, or, failing that, protracted imprisonment in prison cell or refor-
matory."
"Eh? What?" exclaimed JUSTITIA, hotly, forgetting the thermometer
"Personal chastisement?—prolonged imprisonment?—and for such juvenile
peccadilloes as"
"Madam," interrupted ME. PUNCH, politely, "the^Clerico-judicial mind does
not recognise such a perniciously minimising qualification of deadly sin as i
implied in the word peccadillo—at least, in relation to offences against the right;
of property or of Holy Church."
"Remove that person!" said JUSTITIA, with an air of exceeding disgust
"he offends me."
"His removal in a more conclusive fashion," said
IE. PUNCH, "is at present one of the most imperative
emands of common-sense and Christian charity."
"And this shrewd, yet smooth-looking person, who is
le?" asked JUSTITIA, as a wigged and gowned indivi-
ual, of confident air and scrutinising glance, was pre-
ented to her.
"This," said MB. PUNCH, is ME. I. N. QuisnoR, Q.C.,
he pride of the Bar, a gentleman infinitely adroit at
Witness-Box torture and terrorism, warranted to put
more offensive, painful, and irrelevant questions, and to
tir up more forgotten foulness within a given time
han"
"'Foul!' 'Offensive!' 'Irrelevant!' 'Torture!'
Terrorism!'" interjected JUSTITIA. "ME. PUNCH, these
carcely sound like terms of praise—in my ears, at
east."
"Madam," answered ME. PUNCH, " you seem scarcely
jo understand that power of irritating and confusing
witnesses, of wantonly raking up an unpleasant past that
>enitence may have covered from Divine judgment, but
•annot conceal from interested human inquisition, and
of providing the Court and the papers with copious
matter for morbid sensation or heartless mirth;—you
seem, I say, hardly to realise that these rank among
,he choicest and most cherished attributes of the (J.C.
of the period."
'I do not" answered JUSTITIA, emphatically. "Nor
am I quite But call the next prisoner—person, I
mean."
This was a stalwart and stolid personage attired in
)lue; rigid as to spine, stiff as to stock, spikv as to
vhisker, vulgarly aristocratic as to bearing. His eyes
iad a look which was a cross between a menace and a leer,
and his breath a distinctly spirituous bouquet.
"Who is this?" asked JUSTITIA, with an amused
jlance.
"Pleese your Wuship—Ladyship, I means "—began
ie portent in blue—" from information I"
"Hold your tongue, Sir!" said ME. PUNCH, severely.
"This, Madam, is Police-Constable Y Z 0, one of your
so-called guardians of the peace. His idiosyncrasies
in that capacity are interesting from a psychological
point of view. When not inclined for participation in a
"row," he is gifted with a judicial blindness, which
prevents him seeing or sharing in it. When, either for
personal amusement, or with a view to the advancement
}f his reputation as an active and intelligent officer, he
desires a breach of the peace, he is infinitely adroit in
breeding one. He it is who molests well-meaning way-
farers, plies them with ungentle and quite gratuitous
orders to "move on" (or, more idiomatically, to "sling
their hook "), irritates them into angry retort, cuffs them
into some illeonsidered show of resistance, knocks them
down, and then incontinently " runs them in " on charge
of being " drunk and disorderly," and interfering with
the police in the execution of their duty. As he is
generally unable, and always unwilling, to distinguish
between the effects of drunkenness and—say starvation
or epilepsy, as he is unscrupulously mendacious, and as
there is a strong prejudice and presumption in his favour
in all official quarters—
"Enough, enough! " cried JUSTITIA, warmly. MR.
PUNCH, these things are shocking—are scandalous!
They must be seen to!" "Madam," answered ME.
PUNCH, gravely, "I am entirely of your opinion."

DESCRTBING certain Swellesses adorning the Sea-side,
an observant writer states that—
"Among other extraordinary melanget of colour, we saw stone
and green, grey and violet, cream and mauve, cream and violet,
bronze and moss green."
Ladies' dresses, viewed en masse, have often been com-
pared to a flower-bed; and have frequently been said
to vie with rainbows in their hues. But neither flowers
nor rainbows can show such colours as are worn now,
blended curiously together, by our fashionable girls. I
further novelty be wanted, we would suggest, in aU
humility, that cream and violet are not so tasteful as
strawberries and cream. Milk and water might be added
with advantage to the list: and the mixture of bronze
and moss green might suggest the introduction of a cos-
tume which shall imitate the tints of beans and bacon.

IP HER MAJESTY herself had composed the Queen's
Speech, the paragraph therein relative to the Vivisection
Act would no doubt have been more lucid than that
which follows:—
"I anticipate the beet result* from the Act which you hare
passed providing safeguards against painful experiment* on
tiring animals."
The best results? To what, or whom? Society at
large? How the restraint of Vivisection can conduce to
the common good, is at least not obvious. To the lower
animals? Clearly not. Will the result of the Vivisec-
tion Act be in the least to prevent any of them from
being shot and hunted for sport, or trapped in torturing
gins, or boiled and skinned alive? The best results to
animals of an Act for the prevention of cruelty towards
them, would include anesthetics for them when slaugh-
tered—pigs especially being always killed under chloro-
form. But those will be none of the Vivisection Act's
results. So neither will the best results accrue from it to
Humanity in the sense of Benevolence. May they be
anticipated for Physiology and Medicine P As regards
those sciences, unimpeded experiments, requisite for
their advancement, will perhaps result from an Act for
their limitation. Those, in that case, will be the best
results of the Vivisection Act. Well, well! Let us hope
for the best.
CONFESSIONS BY THE SEA.
PATBRFAXILIAS.— Could I only breathe during the day and sleep
at night; could I walk on the sands without being persecuted by
beggars and mountebanks; could I procure wholesome food for the
children and drinkable wine for myself; could I do all this, and not
have to pay about double what I have to spend in Town, I should
really begin to imagine that the Sea-side was not so very inferior to
London.
Materfamilias.—Of course one must go because everybody goes,
but I am sure it doesn't agree with JOHN, and as for the children,
why they would be well anywhere. As for myself, I hate the place.
I cannot bear the squabbles with the Landlady and the quarrels of
the servants. Then the Children make very unpleasant acquaint-
ances on the sands; and altogether I don't like it. I shall be very
glad indeed when we get home.
The Eldest Son.—Nothing to do but to smoke, and the tobacco is
simply—well, call it abominable. Nobody to look at. At least
with one's people round the corner. And then BRACES, the Tailor,
and TOPS, the Bootmaker, are down here; they live respectively
next door and three doors off from our place. Such a bore to meet
them. It is all very well to pretend not to know them, but they
know you, and when they get up to Town they send in their bills.
The Eldest Daughter.—Such a set of people! No use spoiling
one's dresses for a mob like this! Wo are really so hard up for
acquaintances that we are obliged to know the FITZ-ALAN BROWNS
—people we never dream of knowing in Town. Why, they live in
Paddington!
The Youngest Daughter.—Such a nasty place. Such a nasty lot
of water called the Sea where you are dipped! Oh, it is so unkind!
The Yotmgest Son.—No fun! Mamma never will let me bury an
old Gentleman up to his neck in the sand when he's asleep. Grub
little and bad. It's nearly as bad as school.
Mr. Punch.—I confess my surprise. How comes it that, although
most people abuse the Sea-side, everybody visits it?
A POINT FOR PLIMSOLL.
HEBE, extracted from a local newspaper, is a passage in a report
of the transactions of the Cork Steam Ship Company, read at a late
meeting, and composed, apparently, by some amazingly candid gen-
tleman in the management of that model body of mercantile marine
proprietors :—
""We have also sold the Bittern for £2,200. She was completely worn out
from stem to stern, and, as we dare not put her to sea again, we thought the
sooner we got rid of her the better."
This is telling the truth, but not in such sort as recommended by
the proverb, "Tell truth, and shame the devil," who, by such an
avowal as the foregoing, must, on the contrary, one would think,
consider himself highly honoured. DAVY JONES, at any rate, is
surely delighted to hear of the sale of a ship by owners who dare
not put her to sea again. Of course, the sum given for her suggests
to him the hope that she has been bought by parties a little more
venturesome, and will, having been previously well insured, be
shortly sent afloat by them, and soon afterwards founder, all hands
on board of her going down to his locker.

THE CHILDREN DO
BEDLAMS AND BROKEN BONES.
THERE is a disease of the bones, consisting in a state of brittleness
known to Surgeons by the name of Fragilitas Ossium. From cases
reported from time to time, this appears to be a malady very
peculiar to Lunatic Asylums. There seems indeed no reason why
people mentally cracked should also be particularly liable to material
fractures; but BO it is. At several inquests held during the hist few
years on the bodies of patients who died at institutions for the
insane, it has appeared that more or fewer of their ribs especially
were, on examination after death, found broken. It has also
appeared that during life those patients, when violent, were a good
deal accustomed to be knelt upon by keepers and warders, who also
occasionally struggled hard with them to quiet them. Whether the
broken ribs were the sequel only or the consequence as well of this
proceeding, Coroners' Juries have generally failed to discover.
According to the Times, an inquiry about a case of this kind took
place a few days ago at Camberwell. MR. G. HULL held an inquest
on the body of FREDERICK WILLIAM WISLBERLET, a Surgeon, late
inmate of Camberwell House Asylum, where he died. Deceased
was found to have had no less than twenty-one ribs broken, and his
breast-bone too. There was likewise an ulcer of the stomach,
which, on medical evidence, the Jury referred to the same cause as
that which they supposed to have occasioned the broken ribs. Their
verdict was "Death from peritonitis following perforation of the
stomach, and that such death had been accelerated by violence at
the hands of some one in the Asylum, but whether that person was
the attendant SMITH or some one else, the evidence failed to show."
Now is not this one of those verdicts that would justify an order for
a new inquest ad melius inquirendum f
Two several witnesses, to be sure, deposed that they had seen the
attendant SMITH maltreat the deceased man. One of them said that
in May last he saw SMITH throw him down on the grass; when
"the deceased called out as if in pain, and SMITH kicked him about
his body several times." Another " saw an attendant named SMITH
strike the deceased and kick him on Friday." If this evidence
showed that death was accelerated by violence at the hands of some
one in the Asylum, did it not also show that person to have been the
attendant SMITH for one, whether or no there were other persons
besides, concerned in breaking a breast-bone and twenty-one ribs?
But the evidence failing to show the person who inflicted the vio-
lence to have been SMITH, did it not equally fail to show that any
violence had been inflicted at all? The Camberwell Coroner's Jury
had never perhaps heard of Fragilitas Ossium; but they clearly sat
on a case of it :—
"MR. JOSEPH LEES, of St. Thomas's Hospital, said he examined the body
of the deceased. He came to the conclusion that the ribs were extremely
brittle. There had been fractures and refractures of some of the ribs."
Clearly not in consequence of repeated kicks administered at
intervals during some length of time. The deceased had been accus-
tomed to be kicked and beaten with violence neither by the attendant
SMITH, nor any other attendant, or even inmate, of an establishment
where of course humane and competent attendants not only them-
selves abstain, but also restrain violent inmates from assaulting—
to wit, kicking, beating, stamping and kneeling upon anyone.
It may easily be imagined that the unfortunate'deceased. like others
similarly afflicted, was subject to fits, always tumbling about,
knocking himself against chairs and tables, and eTery now and then
breaking a bone or two. Softening of the bones goes together with
softening of the braiii. When'next a Coroner investigates a case of
death, connected with fractured ribs, in a madhouse, it may be
hoped that his Jury will not attend to any idle testimony as to
violence supposed to have caused them, and will cautiously confine
their decision to a verdict of Fragilitas Ossium. In the meanwhile,
the attendants of patients likely to be affected with that degenera-
tion, if they do kick, cannot be too careful how they kick them.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE SILLY SEASON
SETS THE SAME OLD MODELS OF VEGETABLE AND STILL LlFE FOR THE YOTJNO ARTISTS OF THE PRESS.
NO MORE CHAEITY!
THE Secretary of the Anti-Charitable Association presents his
compliments to Mr. Punch, and begs him to give the benefit of the
largest circulation' in the universe to the following philosophical
Propositions enunciated in the Times, by a Gentleman signing him-
*lf " R. BALIOL BRETT," on the subject of " Philanthropy in War."
Ma. BRETT argues that malevolence towards belligerents is really
practised by neutrals in affording any medical assistance, or relief,
w comfort whatsoever to their sick and wounded. He denounces
this effectual inhumanity because—
"Pint, it is a direct encouragement to war, by means of making it easier
*"« lew expensive to the nations engaged.
'Secondly, it is a distinct encouragement to war, by making it less hateful,
«aiuie less horrible, to the folks who stay at home.
"Thirdly, it prolongs war, by patching up wounded men to go and fight
a?ain, and get a second shot at those who haa escaped them once."
This truly philanthropic philosopher further shows that "to
alleviate temporary at the price of ultimate human suffering is a
grossly immoral act; and, to use a Benthamite formula, a sacrifice
of a greater interest to a lesser, a durable to a momentary, a certain
to a doubtful good."
Besides all which, the Secretary of the Anti-Charitable Society
desires to point out, it costs—money. On the' ground, therefore,
of. economy, as well as that of morality, he protests against any
further expenditure for a maleficent purpose on ambulance-corps,
or any other such organisations of mischievous mercy. For the
same reasons he earnestly beseeches the British Public to desist
from subscribing towards the support of Hospitals, and particularly
calls upon the Clergy to preach no more sermons in aid of those per-
nicious institutions, and at once to abolish Hospital Sunday. Diseases
and accidents are the natural consequences of excess, carelessness,
and dirt, which if every offender were left to take them would, alike
with war,' work ultimately their own cure. It is an immoral act even
to administer a pill, or strap a cut finger, much less to practise medi-
cine and surgery at large, except with a single eye to the duty of

providence, ought to be repealed, and all paupers [left without any
noxious mitigation of their miseries, to perish by want and famine.
In conclusion, the Secretary of the Anti-Charitable Society confi-
dently invokes the enlightened Mr. Punch to devote his cudgel to
the promotion of " the greatest happiness of the greatest number"
by exerting it to the uttermost in belabouring and smashing all
manner of Charitable Institutions.

PAT-RIOT-ISM.
HE recent Home-
Rule Conference
in Dublin hav-
ing conclusively
proved how very
worthy the Irish
are of receiving
the boon of a
Native Parlia-
ment, Mr. Punch
ventures to make
a few sugges-
tions that may be
of service sooner
or later to those
fortunate Gen-
tlemen who may
hereafter be elect-
ed to represent
their country-
men on College
Green. If the
following hints
are acted upon,
an Irish Member
of Parliament
should last out
at least two Ses-
sions.
KULES FOR HOME-EULEES.
I. Before leaving your lodgings for Parliament House, be careful
to survey the street from a distance, so that you may detect and
avoid any armed band in the pay of the Opposition.
•f 2. Should the road appear clear, disguise yourself in some appro-
priate costume. Avoid the rags of a beggar, or you may be taken
ior an office-seeker.
3. Bun as fast as you can to the House. Should you hear any
firing, put up your bomb-proof umbrella (new invention to be
obtained, when Ireland has her Parliament, at 85, Fleet Street).
4. On reaching the House, take off your disguise unobserved, and
assume your suit of buff lined with steel armour.
5. Never make a Speech in the House, as, if you do, you will be
called upon to remove your Helmet.
6. When Revolvers are produced, get under the bench upon
whiehyou will, until then, have been sitting.
7. Choose your seat so that your back may be turned to the sun.
If your opponents have the light in their eyes, their aim will be far
from steady.
8. Draw your sword before you take part in a division.
9. If possible sit near the meter, so that you may be able to turn
on the gas when the fighting commences.
10. Never waste your ammunition in bad shots. Aim low, and
keep your wrist steady.
II. Never neglect a wound. The moment you feel yourself hit,
ask the Sergeant-at-Arms to have you carried to the surgery.
12. In conclusion, before being sworn in, forgive all your enemies,
say farewell to all your friends, and keep your will safe in the
bottom of your iron-covered boots. For fear of accidents, you had
better be on good terms with the Parson. Also, to save time, you
may make necessary arrangements about your funeral.
The Confessors of Keighlejr.
^SOMETHING like a dead-lock has occurred in the affairs of the
Keighley Union from the imprisonment of the seven Guardians for
disobeying the Vaccination mandamus. A contemporary refers to
these seven prisoners as " the recalcitrant seven." To recalcitrate,
we know, is to strike or kick with the heel, or kick backwards; and
we also know that to perform this act unadvisedlv, and suffer for it,
is peculiarly characteristic of a certain quadruped needless to name.
The felicity, therefore, of calling these seven Anti-Vaccinationist
Confessors recalcitrant" is extreme.
HAPPY THOUGHTS.
First Impressions—Dublin—Cars and Cabs—A Word on Old-
fashioned Hotels—Trinity College—Disillusions—A Nap—An
Invocation—Awakening—A Change comes o'er the Spirit of my
Dream—Forwards!
Kingstown.—Landing-stage. First view of Ireland. Dull, de-
cidedly. A leaden, morning. Where are all the "boys," and the
par-drWers, and pig-jobbers, and the priests, and the military, and,
in fact, the crowd generally? All my preconceived notions of
"landing in Ireland," founded upon Jack Hinton, have vanished
into thin air.
Ireland, or so much as I see of it at present, is not half awake,
and the landing is the tamest affair possible. Not an early joke
about anywhere: not a witticism in the air. The "boy" puts my
luggage in the train, and takes his shilling without a remark, with-
out even a humorous \twinkle ot his eye. Yet there is novelty in
the atmosphere; not the novelty of a foreign land seen for the first
time, but the novelty of a strange accent, of my native tongne
"gone wrong" somehow. I feel that there cannot be any doubt
about my'being out of England, though there may be some lurking
distrust of my being entirely awake. In legs than five minutes I
clearly comprehend that I am in Ireland. The newspaper man is
offering journals with names new to my ear, though not to my sight.
Notts.—The run by rail into Westland Row Station is decidedly
uninteresting. Judging from what I can see of anything like
scenery—(to ;note first impressions)—this portion of Green Erin
ought to come upon the tenantry for " dilapidations." As bad as
coming into London for the first time by Shoreditch, or the back
gardens of the houses near the Great Western.
Before I have time to do more than struggle with drowsiness, the
train has arrived at its destination, and a Porter is asking me
whether I '11 have " An outside oar, or a four-wheeler P" As I have
not come to Ireland to take a four-wheeler, I immediately close
with the outside car.
Here are the cars—the outside cars—all outside. Some signs of
life: that is something to remind one of Charles O'Malley, &c. At
present my first idea of Dublin is that it wants washing. But this
is exactly what I should say of London, taken from a Shoreditch
point of view, in the early morning of a dull day.
I am rather pleased than otherwise to find that I haven't change
for a shilling in my pocket, and consequently that I am able to tell
the Porter the reason why I cannot give him, as I had intended, a
sixpence. I am'glad, because it will probably bring something witty
out of him, which will be well worth the «xtra sixpence. Not a bit
of it; only what he does say is what I fancy would never have
occurred to a London Railway Porter in similar circumstances. It
is this, quite confidentially: Shure, ay yer goin' to give me anny-
thing, a sixpence or that, ye can sind it back by Aim," indicating
the Carman, who willingly undertakes the commission.
The Carman (standing up on the right side of the Car while I am
on the If ft, holding on to the centre rait). Where am I goin'?
Myself (heartily). To MORRISON'S.
I wish the name wasn't MORRISON'S, as it suggests pills.
Other cars are all leaving at the same time and obstructing the
narrow descent to the gate. The Car-boys shout at one another.
Happy Thought.—Now I shall hear some real genuine Irish fun.
"MICKEY, get out o' the way wid ye, and don't ye be all day,"
Is the nearest approach to humour on this occasion: and yet, some-
how, there is a good-tempered, devil-may-care air among them,
that is quite different from the sulky manner of the London
Cabman.
Still, I may safely note that, so far, early morning in Dublin is
not the time to see an Irishman at his brightest or his best.
At present I am asking " Where 's the rollicking?" The shops
are stfll closed. The people about, seem very much like the people
in any other town about at the same hour, only a trifle more sleepy.
At present I've not heard one "Hooroosh!" or a request to
"tread on the tail of my coat!" or seen a shillelagh, or a bright-
eyed girl going to mass, or a man with a pig, and I begin to wish
I had never read anything about Ireland.
Nothing particularly strikes me, except, that what of Dublin I can
see at a glance, appears very old-fashioned and highly respectable.
The architecture closely resembles the style of hquseyou mav still
see in old coloured prints, representing the " White Horse Cellar,"
and Piccadilly in the old coaching days, or the streets of Bath in the
time of BEAU NASH, GEOHOE THE FOURTH, and TOM and JERRY.
And so alighting at the old-fashioned hotel, I feel immeasurably
depressed, and pay double what I subsequently find was the right
fare, without the spirit to raise a question on the subject.
I have a notion that, on my back being turned, and as I ascend
;he stairs, the Carman has a joke about me with the Boots or the
Sight Porter; but he is welcome to it—only I should like to have
leard this first instance of Irish wit, even at my own expense.
The atmosphere of MORRISON'S preserves a faint odour of a

grandeur long: since faded. There is a •worn-out, tired look about the stair-
carpets, -which says plaintively, "We 've been long trodden beneath the
feet of the Saxon oppressor, but we are passive, and so we have never been
taken up. Yet, see, we are kept down by rods."
The bed-rooms are nobly proportioned, and it is quite a little promenade
from the drawers to the washingstand. I sigh for the comfortably-furnished
appearance of a chambrc a coucher in a good French hotel, with its clock on the
mantelpiece that was meant only for ornament, and never goes, its curtains, its
impracticable shutters and startling window-blinds, its marble-topped chest of'
drawers, its easy chair, its velvet couch, and its two tables of stone—I mean
of marble—I say.I sigh for these things, as real comfort* for which the old style
of hotel has no equivalents.
As a rale, let the inexperienced in travelling take my; advice, and invariably
avoid any hotel whose sole recommendation is'that it is one of the good old-
fashioned sort, where the Landlord makes y<m feel quite at home, and you 're
not treated merely as No. 99 in the books, and stowed away as so much luggage.
Believe me that for every personal attention on the Landlord's part, the Visitor.
will have to pay extra. Politeness costs the Landlord nothing, and therefore.
any profit on it is clear gain and no risk. When I 'enter one of these " Old
Established Houses," and sec the smiling Landlord, in evening1 dress perhaps,
rubbing his hands, bowing and bending, and waving me onwards as he con-
fides me, gracefully, to the care of an elderly, acid-looking female, in starchy
cotton dress-and a primly trimmed cap,'then I tremble for my pocket; but still
I hope for fthe best. But if during my dinner that affable and professionally
genial Landlord comes up to my table, concerns himself about my meat and
drink, and, without reference'to price, recommends to m»,by way of a'great
favour, about which I must keep silence to the other guests^ a lonne-btmcftt.
a magnificent old Burgundy, which, moreover, he insists on decanting and
pouring out for me hitusc/f, with an encomium on its colour and condition,
then I know that ruin stares me in the face, and that the sooner I am out of
that Fine Old English Hostelrie and away from that Fine Old English Landlord,
the better for the modest sum that I have set apart for my- holiday trip. So
much for the Old Fashioned Hotels, and hosts "of the Old School."
A large old-fashioned sash-window gives on to the thoroughfare, and
commands a view of a fine building, which at first sight strikes me as se like
the British Museum that I begin to think that establishment must have been
taken bodily off its basement and 'steps and sent across th# sea. Judging from
first impressions, I conclude that it is either a.Museum, or a Hospital.
I ask the Boots who has shown me to my room, "What is that place?"
Up to this-niomentthe Boots has treated me for an Itobttuf. I never saw a man
more taken aback than that Boots when I asked him for the above information.
"What's that?" he almost shrieked, as though I had found a blackbeetle,
or something smaller and more terrible.
"Yes," I say; "the building opposite."
"That, Sorr," he explains proudly, "is Thrinity College."
Trinity College! Here's an illusion gone! Is this modern-looking building a
College? Oh Trin. Coll. Cam.!—be medieval!—be happy! The only College that
I can recollect in an English University at all resembling Trinity, Dublin, is
Downing, Cambridge.
People are beginning to wake up. There are signs of life in the street.
But—I can't help it—whether it is that, contrary to my custom, I was quite
well but very sleepy after the sea voyage, or whether it is the dulness of the
weather, or the keenness of the East wind, or the "faded flower" air about
MpRBisoN's,—I don't know, in fact, what it is,—but I am melancholy—I am
disillusions —I am sad. I begin to meditate on the wrongs of Irelana. I lie
down to do so, purposing to get up again in ten minutes exactly, and on no
account to go to sleep. It is now nine o'clock. I am experiencing a new and
peculiar sensation—a consciousness of a gradual change of nationality which
13 coming over me — I am slowly casting off the slough of the Englishman,
and entering upon an Irish phase of existence. I have been the worm, I am
the chrysalis, or the cocoon . . . Both excellent Irish names—" MISTHEE
O'CHBYSALIS, and "The COCOON OF COCOON." ... I drop off to doze . . .
Less and less English ... I am sleeping off my English drowsiness to awake to
Irish liveliness . . . Shades of BTJBKE and GOLDSMITH (the only OLIVER that
Ireland had any reason to love), Shade of CUKRAN, Soul o' GRATTAN, Ghost of
SWIFT, inspire my slumbers!
9.30.—I awake. Ready and willing. No longer The COCOON OF COCOON, no
nor MISTHHI O'CmtYSALis—but the real genuine BARNEY O'BUTTERFLY!
Now to sip the dew off the Shamrock, and taste the sweets of the flowers of
Irish Life!
I refer to KEPPEL BERKETT'S introductions, and commence my career. Away!
Electric, Fluid Farming.
THE late storms of thunder and lightning'may be regarded as at least not
unseasonable. This? however, is more than can be said of the behaviour of
atmospheric electricity as thus reported in the Devon Evening Express:—
"The flashes of lightning followed each other so quickly that it seemed one continuous
glare, and the thunder which followed on the instant was like the simultaneous discharge
of a whole park of artillery. A field close to Ballybeg House was ploughed up by the
electric fluid."
Obviously a most inappropriate act on the electric fluid's part. "What,"
as a South-Western agriculturist asked, "was the good o' the lightnin' a
ploughun up a vield in harvust time? If so be Vd ha' took and rip'd a crop
o' earn now, food ha' ben zummut like."
A COCKNEY ON COCK-CEOWIHG.

"The cock, indeed, is by many dwellers in town regarded us
an unmitigated nuisance, to ba abated or suppressed by any
means thfct the law provides. . .. It is we who have degenerated
when we cannot bear the sounda in which our ancestors took
pleasure."—Daily News.

Fills the house and murders sleep,
To the rural districts keep.
Poets may protest perhaps;—
Never understand those chaps.
Gush on " Coek-a-doodle-doo "?

Bard apostrophise that bird? He
Might as well the hurdy-gurdy.
Bosh about the beast's " shrill clarion!"

Let the spirits stop at home!
Can't be bored with shrill-voiced Bantams
To accommodate the phantoms.
Bards seem awful fond of " shines."
Better keep them for their "lines."
Let them, if they like the same,
Play the Cock-a-doodle game;
One 'gainst t'other crow in crackjaw,
Till sound sense shall bid them slack jaw.

PRIESTCRAFT AND PROG.
THE following " Want," extracted from the Universe,
should be explained:—
SITUATION WANTED, by a respectable middle-aged
PERSON as HOUSEKEEPER to a Priest, who can cook
well.—MRS. , &c.
Does the advertiser, then, presume that Priests, as
such, are also, from professional training or peculiar bias,
in general apt to be cooks '( She might; for mental as
well as bodily health would be much promoted by due
ministration to the stomach. Still, as a rule, it seems too
much to expect a Priest to cook for his Housekeeper.
The only cookery, however, that has ever been heard of
as a special element in Priestcraft is that cooking of
scientific and historical fact in.the preparation and supply
of food for the mind, which in order that they may
practise, our friends the Priests are so exceedingly
anxious to get the control of education.

And feeds the squealing swine.

The mattock or the spade;

A QUESTION OF CLEANLINESS.
"CLEKICUS," in a letter to the Times, enumerating the particulars
of the " Cost of a Tour" economically managed by himself and a
couple of Ladies, sets down at a remarkably low figure the special
item of ".washing." Commenting thereon, another Times corre-
spondent, "RUSTICUS," replies by asking for the details of their
washing bills, and offering suggestions which provoke from "CLE-
RICUS" the somewhat angry rejoinder:—" We neither vegetated in
attics, nor washed our own linen, as is so elegantly insinuated."
Very possibly; but then the question to be answered for the benefit
of people who want to know about tourists' washing bills, is how
much of their linen had "Ci.i itircs" and his fair companions
washed by anybody? If they did not do their own washing abroad,
perhaps neither are they themselves accustomed to wash their dirty
linen at home. In that case, what quantity of it is usually washed
at all? And as to washing whilst upon their peregrination, the infor-
mation required is, how far did the travellers go without?
POTATOES IN PERIL!
"A RECENT THAVELLEH" from Canada reports that the Potato
Beetle weathers the winter there, and does great mischief. Atten-
tion is due to his reminder and warning that—
"American potatoes are now largely imported, and, as this pest yearly
travels nearer the sea coast, we are certain to import the eggs, or the impreg-
nated females, and, once established, we shall never get rid of them."
However, he thinks that, with due precaution, it may be possible
"to postpone the evil day." Importers of the American potato,
therefore, mind your (potato's) eye. A destroyer making potatoes as
dear as meat would be an agreeable companion to the foot-and-
mouth disease. The Rinderpest, indeed, was stamped out, but, by
all accounts, there is no stamping out the Potato Beetle.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
OUR REPRESENTATIVE AT THE GREAT WAGNER
FESTIVAL, BAYREUTH.

o. AY, dear Friend and Companion,
why don't you post the tin? How
can I get on at Bayreuth without
the quoi vivre t
You would like to hear some-
thing about the plot of mv chum
DICK WAGNER'S Stage-play, of
course._C Well, it's all about Nothung; but "Nothung" is Sumthung, as. it is
a magic sword. "Void le Sabre de man Herr!" as I sang, just to irritate
B. wTabit. It did.
Ihere is a true Ring about the Nibelungen, for which the Herr Hero-com-
poser at Bayreuth should be crowned with a Bay-wreath.
All these funnimentos, as the Hidalgos say, mjjokhoz. as
my friend the Russian Prince, IvANGUS FORDORSOFF, has
it, I am sending to you, and yet no quarter given!
Until I receive a satisfactory letter from you. my dear
Sir, through an agent of mine, who will call at your
office, I must decline to continue my invaluable corre-
spondence,, though hoping for the very best. I beg to
sign'myself now, as always,
YOUB REPRESENTATIVE.
Note.—There has been clearly some error somewhere. We
hare been out of Town, and hare made use of the time at our
disposal to search the Conversation Books in three languages, to
read all the news from Bayreuth, to receive information from
certain sources, and, finally, to consult our Solicitor. It is with
the deepest regret that we confess our inability to avoid the
conclusions at which we have been compelled to arrive; i.e., (a)
That Our Kepresentative does not understand anything about
Music, or, if he does, that nobody else dots; (4) That if Our
Kepresentative is really acquainted with the dialects, he doea
not know German as spoken; (f) That he is no arithmetician,
and not a man of business; (</) That he is not at Bayreuth at
all, and never has been.
*,* (3-30 P.M.) The above was in print, and (we regret to
say) unrelractulilf, when a most respectable Gentleman called on
us from a most eminent firm of Solicitors, employed by our
etteemed and tuoat trustworthy Correspondent. We never retreat
before a threat, but we are open to conviction, and this Gentleman
has convinced us of Our Representative's veracity. Being em-
powered to receive for our excellent Contributor, our visitor has
given us a receipt for a big cheque, and has undertaken to for-
ward
*»#**•
4.30 p.m. same day (last moment). . . , We thought so! A
Policeman has called to inquire if a respectable looking person,
pawing himself off as connected with a most eminent firm of
Solicitors, has been with us, and extorted . . .
5.30.—The Policeman is still with us. We are concerting a
plan of action. He is now putting on a disguise. MESSRS. MAT
and CLAHK-ON, the well-known theatrical costumiers and per-
ruquiers, are here . . . and we ourselves are going to Bayreuth
with the Policeman, in disguise. We are men of action, and not
to be trifled with. Besides, we want a holiday.—ED.
THE "FORCE" AT PLAT.
AT the annual Fete, at the Alexandra Palace, of that
useful institution, the Police Orphanage, the general
attractions were augmented by the competition of
constables in athletic sports." The historian does
not state whether anybody tried to "outrun the Con-
stable."
CHEAP SHOPPING.
(A Tragic Farce in Two Scenes.)
SCENE'L— The Ulterior of SNOOKS'S Shop. Several Carts labelled
"SNOOKS & Co." waiting to carry away goods. Men carrying
immense bags of expensively got-up Circulars (from SNOOKS
& Co.) to the Post. Several Attendants, dressed in a uniform,
something between those worn by the Police and the Park-
keepers, hovering about the doors of the establishment.
Enter EDWIN and ANGELINA.
Angelina. Look, my darling! This is SNOOKS'S. Is it not a large
place r See the carts, and the men carrying circulars (like the one
we got yesterday—a mass of blue and gold); and the Commis-
sionnaires are so civil. It's the cheapest place in the world, too.
Edwin. It should not be. To the value of the goods must be
added the price of the carts, the cost of the horses, their stabling,
and their food, the wages of the drivers, the expense of printing,
binding, and advertising, and the liveries and stipends of those
much be-medalled loungers over yonder.
Angelina (with feminine logic). For all that, darling, it is the
cheapest shop in the world.
Edwin. .Then I suppose the establishment is conducted on ready-
money principles. What you buy you pay for on the spot, and
SNOOKS & Co. have never to wait the settlement of an unreceipted
bill.
Angelina. If you mean, dear, that you must pay for everything
you get at once, you are o,nite wrong. MR. SNOOKS is most obliging,
and never thinks of sending in a bill for three months—he will wait
a year or.longer. You can t imagine what a cheap shop it is.
Edwin. No, I cannot. Heavy expenses and long credit! SNOOKS
must either be a philanthropist squandering a large fortune away
uponlthe Public, or else must have an insane desire to bring himself
and his Co. into the Court of Bankruptcy! You follow me, darling,
do you not?
Angelina (who has not been listening, as she has been giving her
undivided attention to the contents of the shop window}. Of course,
darling. Oh, isn't that Matelasse cheap and sweet? Only two
shillings a yard. Why, I saw one the other day not a bit better
than this at three shillings.
Edwin. My darling, I fear that you must be growing short-sighted.
Angelina (rather anxiously). My dearest, you are joking, are you
not?
Edwin. What else can I think when you describe that wall-paper-
looking thing at two shillings a yard, when the price only wants
another halfpenny to become three shillings. Certainly the two
shillings is marked in ink, but the elevenpence-halfpenny has its
proper place in pencil.
Angelina. Oh, do let us come in.
[Eownr is dragged into the shop.
SCENE II.—The Interior of SNOOKS'S Shop. A very long and narrow
building. On either side of the counters "bargains" are dis-
played. A great many Shopmen waiting upon a few customers.
The unemployed "young men" assisting their comrades by
piling up articles for the customers' inspection. EDWIN and
ANGELINA enter, and are met by a White-haired Manager.
Angelina. Oh, please, there is a very sweet and pretty Matelassfi
at two-and-elevenpence-halfpenny a yard, in the window
White-haired Manager. Certainly, Madam. This way, if you
please. (Leads them to the very end of the shop, and offers them
chairs.) I think you said a Matelasse at flve-and-elevenpenoe-three-
farthings a yard. A great bargain, indeed. (To Shopman.) Show
the Lady the article.
Edwin (firmly). This Lady said nothing of the sort. The price
she mentioned was two-and-elevenpence-halfpenny. There can be
no mistake. The dress, with its price-card, is in the window.

Shopman) will attend to you.
[Retires, and brings, after a pause of fire minutes, another Customer to
the end of the shop.
Angelina (on the White-haired Manager's retreat]. My darling, you should
not he so cross. I am sure you made him go.
Edwin (with savage triumph). I am sure I did.
Confidential Shopman (placing goods on the. counter]. These are the dresses
you want, Madam. I do not mind telling you that we got them by the greatest
luck. The Bankrupt had taken his passage to America. The Detectives stopped
the ship, and got the goods away.
Edwin, And the Bankrupt?
Confidential Shopman (taken aback). I think he escaped. But (coming to the
point) that is why we can sell them at six-and-sixpence a yard.
Angelina. Oh, but the one I saw in the window was
Confidential Shopman. Of vastly inferior quality to this, Madam. In fact I
don't mind telling you that we cannot guarantee our goods in the window.
Edwin. Yery well, then we will go. [Rising.
Confidential Shopman. Pray resume your seat, Madam. Of course we
guarantee all our goods. Here are the dresses you mean. You see they are
not of the same quality as this. (Taking tip another material.) It was ordered
by the late SDLTAN OF TCKKEY for his favourite Sultana, and of course was not
wanted. We are thus able to offer it at eight-and-tenpence-three-farthings.
May I cut you off a dress?
Angelina. It is really very sweet. Only eight shillings a yard!
Confidential Shopman. Twenty-six yards will be enough, Madam, I think?
Edwin (firmly). If you cannot show us the dresses marked three shillings a
yard (all save one halfpenny), we will trouble you no further.
Angelina (timidly). Yes, the Sultana's cotton is very beautiful, but I think
I should like to see the Matelasse at two-and-elevenpence-halfpenny.
Confidential Shopman (contemptuously). They are here. They will not wash.
Edwin. Oh, very well; we will not buy them. [Rises.
Confidential Shopman. At least they will not wash quite so well as this
magnificent affair, which was made for the coronation of the POPE. It has
taken fifteen years in its manufacture; and as, of course, it is not wanted now,
we can cut you off enough for a dress for six pounds twelve shillings and
tenpence-three-farthings.
Edwin. You had better keep it for the next Pope—we don't want it.
Angelina (having telected a dress). This, please. I like
the large pattern.
Confidential Shopman. The large patterns are dearer.
The one you have chosen is four-and-sevenpence-half-
penny.
Edwin (losing his temper). Don't beat about the bush
any longer. Which are the dresses you pretend to sell
at three shillings a yard?
Confidential Shopman (startled, and hurriedly). These.
Edwin (to Angelina). My own, choose one. (One is
chosen.) And now put it up, and bring the bill.
Confidential Shopman (recovering himself). While I
cut oft the necessary length. Madam, will you look at
this grand silk? It was made for the President of the
United States when he thought of taking office for the
third time. As he has retired, we can now offer it (as
it is left upon our hands) for nineteen-and-elevenpence-
three-f arthings, as a remnant.
Edwin (seeing that the parcel is at last made up). Now
let us go.
Confidential Shopman. The bill, Madam. And while
this Gentleman is paying it, will you permit me to
show you this glorious velvet? It was ordered by Dox
CARLOS"
Edwin (hurriedly). Let us go.
[Drags his loving but reluctant wife away. As they
pass down the long shop, "young men " (like mer-
maids) try to tempt ANGELINA with bargains.
White-haired Manager (meeting them at the door).
One moment, Madam. Have you seen these gaze de
chambryf We have got them a bargain. They were
recovered from a wreck, and"
Edwin. We don't want them.
[The White-haired Manager recognises EDWDT, and
retires in confusion.
Angelina (on leaving SNOOKS'S, pointing to another
shop-window). Oh, EDWIN, darling, there s exactly the
same thing we have just bought!
Edwin (with malicious pleasure). Yes; and just a
shilling the yard cheaper! [Scene closes in.
INCREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE.
WHAT the French call "faits divers," which are any-
thing but facts, are sprinkled pretty freely in our own
provincial press, especially when Parliament has risen
for the recess. Clearly some of our contemporaries give
their constant readers credit for enormous powers of
credence, when they fill so many columns with such
paragraphs as these:—
SINGULAR FREAK OF LIGHTNING.—A curious instance
of the versatility of the electric fluid occurred the other
day in Longbowtown, Connecticut. During a tempest,
which had raged above a week in that vicinity, a flash
of lightning was observed, by a reporter who happened to
be present, ascending the third lamp-post from the corner
of the market-place. After turning off the gas, it des-
cended to the ground again, and quickly crossed the
pavement; then rang the area bell, and gave a thunder-
ing double knock at the door of Number Nine, the
residence of DR. CRAMMER, to whom we owe a record of
the subsequent proceedings. Entering through the key-
hole, the lightning briskly ran upstairs, lit all the
candles in the drawing-room, split the looking-glass in
two, and played a waltz on the piano. Next it went into
the smoking-room, and burned a box of choice Havan-
nahs; then, dropping to the cellar, it drew the corks
of six champagne bottles, without unfastening the wires;
and, after cutting up a cucumber and a roast goose ill
the kitchen, it made its exit up the chimney, which it
swept most carefully, consuming in its progress every
particle of soot.
REMARKABLE VORACITY OF A PIKE.—A fact has come
under our notice which we fancy has escaped the watchful
eye of MR. BUCKLAND, MK. LEE, and other famous pisci-
culturists, to whom we would commend it as an incident
well worthy of their investigating scrutiny. We are
informed on what we take to be quite trustworthy (as
Englishmen, we scorn to say reliable) authority, that
somewhere on the road between Birmingham and Bangor
there has been taken an old pike, by a man who means
to keep it, and we are given to understand that as many
as five pounds of current copper currency has in one day
been found deposited in its capacious maw.

Would it find him 'too old' for a Leader?
; Too old? We remember stout evergreen PAM;
You 're a youngster, you know, in comparison;

There's full many a fact stands attestor.

[See Times Police Eeport, Worship Street, August 23.]
SCENE I.—A Town Hall. Enter Distressed Woman, hurriedly.
Woman. Oh, if you please, I've had this ticket given me and
this letter of recommendation, and the Gentleman told me you would
assist me. I 'm in great, great distress!
Well-Fed Official (after reading letter). Umph—yes—a sad case,
indeed. (Cheerfully.) Very sad. I can't do better than give you
a letter to one of the Organised Philanthropists (who is at the sea-
tide]. His Town residence is only five miles from here. It's a
pleasant walk. (Gives letter.) Good day.
SCENE II.—Exterior of Town Residence of First Organised
Philanthropist.
Burly Sutler (to Distressed Woman, who has walked the five miles).
No, he's hout o'Town. Yes, I see it's hurgent; so you'd better
>ro down to No. 720, Stucco Villas, to the Clergyman, he's one of the
Philanthropists, an' he '11 attend to you. Mind the dawg!
SCENE III.—Exterior of No. 720, Stucco Villas.
Enter Distressed Woman.
Distressed Woman. Oh dear, dear! what shall I do if he's not
lere? I'm so tired. What a long road! My poor children!
«hey '11 wonder what has become of me. [Knocks one knock.
Door opened by comfortable-looking Housekeeper.
Housekeeper. No, not to-day; and don't come knocking at people's
loors like-;—Oh, vou 've got a letter. Dear, dear! you must have
>een suffering! How sad! Six children, too! Well, MB. SERAPH
is not here just now; but when he's not here, MR. SCKEWBT, who's
one of the Society, always attends to his business. It's about a
mile and a half down the road. Good morning. [Shuts door.
SCENE IV.—-Exterior of Haute of Third Organised Philanthropist.
Enter Distressed Woman, who is informed that Ma. SCBEWBT is on
the Continent, but that the Doctor, three squares off, will attend
to her.
N.B.—To save time and space, it may be added that the Doctor
can do nothing but refer her to the Relieving Officer, who was " also
out." She then calls upon another Organised Philanthropist, who
tells her to get a letter certifying her respectability and poverty.
For this purpose she reverts to the Clergyman.
SCENE V.—Stucco Villas.
Clergyman. What, no food? Humph! Six children? Walked
seventeen miles? Dear, dear! Well, you must live till Monday,
and then you must go before the Organised Philanthropists. Let's
see, there 's seven of you altogether. Well, there "s twopence-
halfpenny a-piece for you, and a halfpenny over. Mind, you'll
have to show you 're thoroughly respectable.
N.B.—In the meantime the Distressed Woman is arrested for
doing what she had no right to do, i.e. pawning illegally to pay out
a distress for rent. The Organised Philanthropists cast her off with
horror. The Magistrate says it is a " painful case, and deserves the
deepest sympathy," but he must fine her one shilling, and order
her to pay six shillings, the value of the pledged articles.
SCENE VI. AND LAST—Interior of Police-Court. Woman being
led to the Cells in default of payment.
Un- Organised Philanthropist. Here! look here! I '11 pay the
money. Let the poor creature go!

THE Exhibition' of Scientific apparatus, now open at [South

interesting problems:—
How many persons of position in Society, supposed at the present

all the while in London, leading a sequestered life in the back rooms
of their apparently deserted mansions?
Of all those who are now away in expensive and unsatisfactory
lodgings at places of fashionable resort, what per-centage are, at
this moment, heartily wishing themselves back in their comfortable
homes?
How many persons within the last six weeks have discovered that
they are afflicted with some ailment, for which they (or their medical
advisers) consider an immediate and thorough change imperatively
requisite?
How many Englishmen and Englishwomen are now lavishing
their money and their raptures on France, Italy, Switzerland,
Germany, Belgium, Iceland, &c., who have the most meagre
acquaintance with the beauties and attractions of their own
country?
How many yards of material are comprehended in a silk dress for
evening wear?
How many families will return home from abroad or the sea-side,
and find everything as it ought to be—the papering and painting
done to their satisfaction, the house clean, the furniture in nice
order, and the conduct of the servants left in charge irreproach-
able?
How many Conservative speeches will be delivered in the recess,
maintaining the last Session to have been everything that could be
wished; and how many Liberal addresses will be devoted to proving
the exact contrary?
How many anxious reflections will SIB STAFFORD NORTHCOTE have
between now and next February, when he thinks of the Leadership
of the House of Commons, with MR. GLADSTONE and MR. LOWE
sitting very attentive on the opposite benches?
How many times next Session will his party wish the EARL OF
BEACONSFIELD back in the House of Commons?
How many Meetings, Congresses, Exhibitions, Shows, and Dinners
will be held at home this autumn r
How many persons of ripe age can say, without dissembling, that
they thoroughly enjoy a game of Lawn Tennis on a hot afternoon
with the sun full in their eyes?
How many years have yet to elapse before London will be properly
governed, and brought into a satisfactory state as to the condition of
its streets, its gas and water supply, its smoke, its vehicles plying
for hire, &c.?
How many persons moving in a respectable sphere of society can
show a tolerable acquaintance with the geography of that quarter of
Europe in which war is now going on?
How many passengers will cross the Channel these holidays, to
whom the wish will not suggest itself with vivid intensity that the
submarine tunnel between England and France was complete and
in full activity?
How many novels have been published this last season which have
the smallest chance of being remembered next year?
How manv foreigners visit London without making an early call

PUNCH'S COUNTRY COUSINS' GUIDE.
THE METKOPOUS IN THE MORTB SAISOX,
8 A.M.—Rise, as in the country, and stroll round the Squares
before breakfast, to see the turn out of Cooks and Charwomen. Ask
your way back of the first Policeman you meet.
9 A.M.—Breakfast. First taste of London Milk and Butter.
Analyse, if not in a hurry. Any Policeman will show you the
nearest Chemist.
10 A.M.—To Battersea Park to see Carpets beaten. Curious atmos-
pheric effects observable in the clouds of dust and the language of
the beaters. Inquire your road of any Policeman.
11 A.M.—Take Penny Steamer up to Westminster Bridge, in time
to arrive at Scotland Yard, and inspect the Police as they start on
their various beats. For any information, inquire of the Inspector.
12 A.M.—Hansom Cab Races. These can be viewed at any hour by
standing still at a hundred yards from any Cabstand and holding up
a shilling. An amusing sequel may be enjoyed by referring all the
drivers to the nearest Policeman.
1 P.M.—Observe the beauties of solitude among the flowers in
Hyde Park. Lunch at the Lodge on Curds and Whey. Ask the
whey of the Park Keeper.
2 P.M.—Visit the Exhibitions of Painting on the various scaffold-
ings in Belgravia. Ask the next Policeman if the House Painters
are Royal Academicians. Note what he says.
3 P.M.—Look at the shops in Bond Street and Regent Street, and
purchase the dummy goods disposed of at.an awful sacrifice.
4P.M.—See the Stickleback fed at the Westminster Aquarium.

you over the building.
5 P.M.—Find a friend still in Town to give you five o'clock tea in
her back drawing-room—the front of the house being shut up.
6 P.M.—Back to the Park. Imagine the imposing cavalcades in
Rotten Row (now invisible), with the aid of one exercising groom
and the two daughters of a riding-master in full procession.
7 P.M.—Wake up the Waiters at the Triclinium Restaurant, and
persuade them to warm up dinner for your benefit.
8 P.M.—Perambulate the Strand, and visit the closed doors of the
various Theatres. Ask the nearest Policeman for his opinion on
London Actors. You will find it as good as a play.
9 P.M.—A Turkish Bath may be had in Covent Garden Theatre.
Towels or Programmes are supplied bj the Policeman at the doors.
10 P.M.—Converse, before turning in, with the Policeman on duty
or the Fireman in charge of the fire-escape. Much interesting

HE pilgrim of Britain^

I .earns to like and to

By his Guide or his
Book,
Be it MURRAY or COOK;
The same thing's left undone,
The same by each one done,
'Twixt Thule and London.
All their "selves" glad to merge,
Through the same gap must surge,
Like the sheep of Panurge,
As COOK bids, on they scurry;
Or tractably hurry
At the order of MCTRRAY.
JOHN BULL once had a "willy,"
Andalsoa"nilly;"
Loved to dally or dilly—
With his own eyes once looked:
Now he likes his routes Cooked,
His opinions Red-booked,
His thoughts'ran in a mould—
Calf's-foot jelly-like, cold-
Laughs or sighs, as he's told
To be grave or rejoice;
Till his voice is COOK'S voice,
And his choice is COOK'S choice.
COOK'S tariff his steady care:
His taste ruled by ready caro
Of MTTRKAT or BAEDEKER.
Trots and halts in a band,
Likes, dislikes, second hand,
At the word of command.
And regains his own shore,
His travelling o'er,
The same BULL as befo
•fore.
WHAT NO ONE SHOULD FORGET/ IN CROSSING THE
CHANNEL.
To place his Rugs, Carpet-bags, and Umbrellas on'the six best
seats on the Boat.
To worry the Captain with remarks about the state of the weather
and the performance of the Steamer: to observe to the Steward that
there is a change in the weather, and that there were more Passen-
gers the last time he crossed.
To speak to the Man at the Wheel, and ask him whether there
was much sea on last trip.
To change his last half-crown into Frenoh money, and squabble
with the Steward as to the rate of exchange.
To stare at his neighbours, read aloud their names on thejr lug-
gage, and remark audibly that he '11 lay anything the Lady with the
slight twang is an American.
To repeat the ancient Joke on " Back her 1 stop her!"
If the passage is rough, to put his feet on his neighbour's head,
after appropriating all the cushions in the cabin.
To call for Crockery in time. N.B.—Most important.
To groan furiously for an hour and a half, if a sufferer; or, if
utterly callous to waves and their commotions, to eat beef and ham,
and drink porter and brandy-and-water, during the entire voyage,
with as much clattering of forks and noise of mastication as is com-
patible with enjoyment.
To kiss his hand, on entering the harbour, to the matelottes on the
quays, or send his love in bad French to the Prefect of Police.
To struggle for a front place, in crowding off the Steamer, as if
the ship was on fire. And finally—
To answer every one who addresses him in good English in the
worst possible Frenoh.
88. Patrick and Partridge.
"Now at the Birds, me Boy, let dhrive!"
Says MIKE, exhorting DAN.
"That's how we '11 keep the game alive,
By killing all we can 1"

OUR CAT SHOW.
ONE of these fine days (if we are lucky in the weather) we mean
to start a Cat Show, for the purpose of displaying certain interesting
r Linens which have not yet been admitted to feline exhibitions,
instance, we imagine that the No-tailed Cat of Munxland ia not
much of a novelty, although there may be sceptics who question its
existence. But the British Nine-tailed Cat has not been shown
lately, excepting to those favoured with a private view of it in
Newgate. _ We may conceive, then, that a specimen will be regarded
with considerable interest by the public, and, if a few professional
garottcrs or ruffianly wife-beaters can be induced to come, they
perhaps may learn a highly beneficial lesson.
Another most attractive novelty will be the Voiceless Cat (Felii
sileus), a breed which we shall take great pride in introducing. So
many people are annoyed by the 01 amour-rank ing Cat (FeKt catter-
waulani), which is well known to all Londoners, more especially at
nightfall, that we expect the Voiceless Cat will be much petted by
tie public, and we doubt not that a first prize will be readily
awarded to it. Indeed, we think it likely that its merits will
obtain the Gold Medal of the Show, and, if this should he the case,
we would suggest as a fit motto, to be stamped upon the medal,
"Sant purr et sans reproche."
Perhaps, however, the most curious of all the Cats exhibited will be
the Felit pmnivora, or Common Lodging-House-Keeper's Cat. Of this
extraordinary species we are expecting to collect some vastly inte-
resting specimens, from Brighton, Ramsgate, Margate, Scarborough.
Llandudnp, and many other sea-side popular resorts. The principal
peculiarities of the Lodging-House- Keeper's Cat are its voracious appe-
tite and unparalleled capacity for consuming or destroying everything
within its reach. There are oases upon record wherein abundant
evidence has been furnished as to this, and we fancy few zoologists
will venture to dispute the truth of our assertion that few creatures
are more costly than the f'e.lis omnivora, if we regard merely the
damage it is daily said to do. If we may credit oral testimony, it
would appear that in one single night a Cat of this destructive breed
has broken a decanter, three wine glasses, and the handle of a
water-jug, besides emptying a cigar-case, a jam-pot, and a tea-
caddy, and more than half consuming a stick ot barley-sugar and a
tin 01 maccaroons. There would seem to be no limit to the powers
of its appetite, or the variety of its tastes. _ Eatables and drinkables
disappear, when in its neighbourhood, with marvellous rapidity;
and things which would be scarcely digested by an Ostrich are
stomached with facility by this all-consuming Cat. From soap to
soda-water, from hair-oil to postage-stamps, everything will vanish
that comes into its claws. Bolts and bars will fly asunder; closets,
cellars, cheffoniers will readily reveal their treasures to this creature,
and be gutted in a twinkling of their manifold contents. According
to one Landlady, whose evidence was fortified by that of her own
servant, the absence of two hours on the part of a Lodger has
afforded ample time for a Cat of this description to steal a quire of
note-paper, swallow three-fourths of an apple-pie and half a leg of
mutton, .besides drinking very nearly a whole bottle of Scotch
whiskey, kept under lock and key.
Striking Allusion.
MB. PUNCH has been requested to explain what the Directors of a
certain Railway Company mean by announcing that passengers
taking return tickets to Belfast are required to nave their tickets
Punched on board the steamboats—to prevent fraud. Some sort of
reference to himself, apparently, has been suggested by the word
"Punched" with a large P. Perhaps it is expected that this sug-
gestion will be taken for a capital joke.

NASAL REFORM.
HADE ot SLAWKENBERGIUS,
here is an advertisement,
extracted, with unimpor-
tant and nominal altera-
tions, from the Daily
News !—
A—ITS nose is... Send
• me number of SMITH
13no WN'S, Blank Highway, that
I may get a NOSE MACHINE
to alter it. Will BROWN send
machine bypost for 10s. 6rf. in
stomps? Write soon.
What an engine, if really
available to modify noses,
and if you, SLAWKENBER-
GITIS and Mn. SHANDY, are
right, this Nose Machine
must be for good or evil!
For evil, as enabling a ca-
pricious or unnatural parent
to twist and alter perhaps
the leading family feature
of his child. For good, when
instrumental to a scientific
physiognomist in elongating
a stunted nose, rectifying a
misshapen one. or even per-
haps so moulding the nose
as with it to mould also the character. Of course the DUKE of WEL-
LINGTON, but for his nose-would never hfcvB won Waterloo. Convert a
nose into such another as WELLINGTON'S, and constitute another WEL-
LINGTON. Or suppose a Hebrew converted by a Missionary, his nose, by
means of the Nose Machine, could, if he wished it, be converted too.
Talk of TALIACOTIUS, and his rhinoplastio operation, what is that to
SMITH BROWN, and MR. BROWN'S rhinoplastio apparatus? Think
what wonders of moral and social improvement it is capable of
being, and, let us hope, in good hands will be, employed to work!
And all at.the comparatively small sum of ten and sixpence! To be
sure, the name of BROWN is a substitute for the one that appears
in the original advertisement, which, purporting to signify a want
of the Nose Machine, may just possibly be mistaken for a dodge to
promote its sale.
HAPPY-THOUGHT NOTES IN IRELAND.
At MORRISON'S—Tied by the Leg—Dulness—Anticipations unrealised
—Irishmen wanted—Cricket at Trinity—Nothing doing—Reso-
lution—Cheering up—Hospitality—A Promise—Jokes on Bray
— Railway Officials—Irish Fatalism—A new Philosophy.
I HAVE only one disturbing thought on awaking to the pleasant
fact that I am in Dublin, and that is the legal memorandum now
lying before me, dating from PLTTMWON AND SPRY'S, which, speak-
ing tor HER GRACIOUS JtfAJESTY and her trusty and well-beloved SIR
PETER PYPER. Lord Chief Justice of England, in effect, sayu, "My
dear friend, don't go too far: be' as quick as yon can: for, at any
time, and at any place, you may be wanted." Why, even Dr.
Faust's bargain with II Diarolo's agent, Mephistopheles, was better
than this. He knew the length of his tether: I don't. Evidently,
I must make the best use of my time. With which moral sentiment
I sit rdown to make my arrangements, and takej breakfast, in the
grand but cheerless Coffee-Room.
[ cannot, as yet, shake off the flat ehampagney feeling which has
fallen upon me. There is no Rollicking. I have been all along
expecting Rollicking everywhere, and I can't see a sign of it.
I had expected the Waiters to be brimming over with fun. I
anticipated mistakes at my meals which would be immediately re-
deemed by such a sally of wit as would set the table, that is, myself
at the table, in a roar.
Not a bit of it. The Waiters are obliging, but melancholy. The
exemplary and polite Manager speaks with an accent, which, being
in Ireland, I attribute to some provinciality. I address him as an
Irishman. He is flattered by my compliment to his pronunciation
of English, but he is a Frenchman.
After this I am more cautious. Clearly, all is not Irish that is in
Ireland. The Head Waiter speaks English perfectly. He is, at all
events, not an Irishman. I ask him now long he has been here.
Oh, any number of years. I wonder he has not picked up the
brogue. He smiles: he thinks I am satirical ... as he happens to
be an Irishman.
One more shot. A bright-haired, broad-shouldered Waiter, close
shaven, with a bright complexion. A North Country Irishman, I '11
be bound. He' certainly has a brogue. Wrong again. He is a
Swede.
As far as Waiters are concerned, I give up all guessing at
nationality.
"Ireland for the Irish" P Nonsense. Ireland for the Englishmen,
the Frenchmen, and the Swedes. Already I feel I must be a Home-
Ruler, or something which means Ireland for the Irish, and the
Irish for Ireland.
Humming the " Wearing of the Green" I take my way down to
Westland Row Station. The only "Wearing of the Green" I can
see comes from the shoes of the cricketers engaged in a match on the
Trinity College ground. The sports of the Collegians are visible to
the public through the railings, very much as the sports of the Blue
Coat Boys are witnessed with delight by the passers-by, to and fro,
before that depressing debtors'-prison sort of grille.
I join the spectators at the railings. No: I cannot associate the
appearance of these Collegians, nor the exterior of the College itself,
with anything academical—that is, as I understand academical. I
see no accidental caps and gowns, which give the local colouring to
the streets, to the College grounds, and even the neighbourhood, of
the old Universities, Oxford and Cambridge. I see nothing which
calls to mind the Students' club caps of Heidelberg and Bonn, or the
Polytechnic of Aachen. It is all too modern, too unacademical, for
a College, and after this I should not be surprised if (I saw the
Judges and Barristers in the Law Courts without their wigs and
bands.
From all along the line of lookers-on outside I hear no sharp re-
marks, no telling observations, in fact, nothing humorous or funny
whatever. I sigh and pass on. Have I arrived in Dublin at a time
when, as they say in the City, "things are uncommonly flat, and
nothing doing" P I walk on, "speculating for a rise," as I pass the
Carmen on their stand. There are no rises, there are no sells. I
have come on Dublin at a bad moment.
I will go to Bray. Were I to announce this intention in the
presence of some foolish jesters, whose aim in life is never to let a
word pass that can be played upon, they would immediately retort,
",Are you going to Bray f Nothing more natural, my dear fellow."
It is a Kind of pun that makes one sad.
Happy Thought.—GtA\. on a friend of KEPPEL BIRKETT'S, who
"knows the ropes," ort rather, "the lines." and ask about going to
Bray, and what to see when I get there. He is so delighted to see
me, and I am so heartily received that I begin to cheer up.
My excellent acquaintance is sorry to part with me for a moment.
Have I breakfasted!' YesP Then, wfll I take anything P NoP
Then won't I come and lunch? Won't I dine? Won't I stay with
them? Surely I am not going away so soon? Why, there are at
least fifty people who would never forgive him (the speaker) if he
allowed me to quit Dublin.
Happy Thought.—The Irish are evidently a most hospitable
people.
I explain. Legal business (meaning PLUMPTON AND SPRY) neces-
sitates a short stay.
DALEY'S distress is really genuine. If he could only improvise a
dinner-party on the spot, there and then, in his office, he would do
so. He hardly can bring himself to part with me. He has his
doubts about my ever coming back again, if once I am allowed to
leave Dublin. He is overflowing with genial regret that he cannot
travel with toe, keeping a guard over me as though I were a
hospitality-prisoner, for whose appearance at the dinner hour he.
DALEY, had made himself responsible. But if I go now I shall
return P Certainly.
"I must get DR. PHORDE McMrjLLEN and SIB RICHARD LOPTT/S to
meet you," says my new.friend, DALEY, pondering. "Ye '11 know
PHORDE and LOFTT/S P"
Will IP I mean, do I? No, I regret to say I don't. I feel,
somehow, I ought to.
"PHORDE writes for the Magazines, and his book on The Dithy-
rambic of Slogan,—maybe ye '11 have heard of that? It made a good
deal of stir lately, and neither TENNYSON nor BROWNING could reply
to it."
I feel that I 'm "not in it," as the sporting men say.
Happy Thought.—Of course IknowDR.-^er—er—(I have forgot-
ten his name, and DALEY kindly supplies it)—yes, DR. PHORDE, by
reputation, but I 've never had the pleasure of meeting him.
"You shall then," says DALEY, heartily. "I '11 get together all
the boys I can, and we '11 have a night of it."
I am delighted at the prospect. Yet my joy is tfnctuf ed with
fear. Who are "the boys^' P What does a v night of it" mean?
Whiskey punch and smoking, and every one, being accustomed to
"nights of it," all right except myself P And is ft myself that 'II be
ill for at least a week afterwards f If so—then the best thing will
be to see the country first and enjoy my days, then return to Dublin
"to make nights of it."
Yet I feel that I have PLtrttPTbN AND SPBY after me. Before
starting for Bray I write to them, " Sirs, I shall be at Bray before
you get this, and after that probably ' Post Office, Dublin,' will find

at
me; I mean, I shall find a letter or a telegram, if you tend one, u
Post Office-Dublin. Is this clear f How's the case yetting on?"
A Seal Happy Thought for a Postscript.—" Try and do without
my evidence, as what I know of the matter will be dead against
your side. Yours ever, &c."
Evidently that will stagger PLUMTTON and bother SPRT. It
means, in effect, "Don't call me as your witness, or you '11 lose."
Now to Bray. Most unfortunate name as falling unavoidably
into the form of expression. I suppose the elegant witticism of
pointing to a passenger and saying There's a donkey going to
Bray" must have long ago been exhausted in every form. Thank
goodness for that.
It is impossible to help remarking at all Stations on the Irish lines,
the charmingly careless manner of the officials. They are all pecu-
liarly polite, but they seem to be taking their duty as a pleasure, and
not to be after botherin' themselves about the punctuality of the trains.
An Irish porter never knows exactly when the next train is going,
nor where it is going to. But, clearly, this concerns the passenger,
not him. Yet, on the whole, in spite of this carelessness of manner,
this utter absence of all fussiness—for no one ever yet saw any
Irishman in a hurry—is only characteristic of the people, and not any
evidence of nnpunctaality on the part of the trains. On the contrary,
my experience _ is—if called as a witness in a committee-room on a
question of Irish lines—that they do keep time admirably. Their
careless manner is rather suggestive of a kind of cheerful fatalism,
—that is, an " all-right-in-the-end" view,—than of any want of
confidence in the railways, and those who manage them.
The Irish, in respect of conduct at Railway Stations all along the
line—for I am reviewing them all along the line
Happy Thought.—A. first-rate subject for Miss THOMPSON, when
tired of the Military, would be—" The Old (Railway) Guard—A
Review all along the Line." I make this a present to the justly
celebrated artist whose motto should be from the song of the Orande
Duchesse, "Ah, quej'aime les Militairet!"
But, "Proceed r Your story interests me much."
As I was saying, when I was interrupted, the conduct of the Irish
at Railway Stations reminds me of the French and Belgian country
people at their gares on fete days, when trains run anyhow, at any
time and at all times, on any lines and on all lines, when peasants,
ladies, gentlemen, soldiers, ecclesiastics, police, officials, porters;
women with flags, or bells, or horns (in their hands, Men entendu—
horns to blow as signal;for the train to start—or bells in their
horny hands—suggestion for a joke for HORNE TOOKE, or SHERIDAN,
or SYDNEY SMITH), all wander about the lines quite calmly and most
happily, occasionally drawing aside to allow an engine to pass, and
helping their friends to descend from the compartments, which are
at some distance from the ground, and to reach a platform is out of
the question.
Once get_into your head that " There's no occasion to hurry," and
travelling in Ireland becomes a pleasure: only you must enter into
this peculiar phase of Irish humour. And, above all things, you
must adopt the " all-right-in-the-end " philosophy of DR. O'KiSMET.
The Tourist in Ireland should not have any clear idea of where he
is going to next. He may, just for the sake of the Clerk at the
ticket-office, and of his luggage—if any to speak of—name a desti-
nation, but it will be more in keeping with the tone of the people if
he is prepared to stop at some unexpectedly attractive spot on the
road, have his luggage out, and remain there until he has had
enough of it.
In this spirit I " go for " Bray.
THE FRENCH ON THE FIRST.
NLY the other day
a new French
paper was esta-
blished in Paris,
under the sug-
gestive title of
Le+ Sportsman,
which, doubtless,
will soon be-
come as popular
amongst our
neighbours as
Bell's Life is
with us. As the
journal is a new
one, Mr. Punch
has much" plea-
sure in presenting
its proprietors
with a report of
Sport on the First which has been
furnished to him by an experienced
French "Gentlemans-Ridere," re-
gardless of expense :—
Hotel de France et Les Deux Mondes, W. C.,
September 1, 1876.
MY DEAR EDITOR-IN-CHIEF,
You have asked me am I Sportsman? It was an insult!
A Frenchman is always brave. To be Sportsman one must also be
brave. Therefore a Frenchman is always Sportsman. Why? Be-
cause he is brave. "This may not be truth," you say. No. It is
something better—it is logic!
I am Sportsman, and I have many friends of distinction who are
also Sportmans. They are French. On August 31st we met at
your grandest London square—your square where WILLIAM SHAK-
SPIERRE (the Immortal WILLIAMS! Ah! he was a great 'man, a
very great man—nearly as great as our own AISXANDRE DUMAS)
points to a fountain which plays but seldom, and we discussed—you
ask what? What should " Gentlemans-Rideres" discuss? Why,
the Sport. Long live the Sport! We decided, we three " Gentle-
mans-Ride'res," to go and shoot your partridges, your swallows, your
Sheasants, your rabbits, your sea-gull! Ah! you think we French
o not know your Sport—your 1st September! You are mistaken!
Miserables, you are all mistaken! We know the Sport v«ry well.
We dressed in full costume; we were prepared for the terrors of
the Chase. The MABQUIS DE CHATEAU ORDINAIRE wore green
velvet, the VICOHTE DE POMMES FRITES blue satin, and I red cloth,
for I love to chase the artful hare. We all had large horns worn

round the body, and our hunting swords dangled at our sides. The
Marquis, as our leader, wore a plume of feathers in his jocke hat —
our jock6 hats were only trimmed with gold. You see, we French
Sportmans know how to dress.
We took our places in the train, and soon reached the wood we
had.fixed on. It belonged to a gentleman who had advertised. I
quote his communication; it has appeared in your Times:—
SHOOTING over 1500 Acres for Two Months.—A Gentleman, having
been prevented from shooting his well-preserved Manor, ii desirous of
baring two or three Gentlemen to snoot.
This Sportsman he could not shoot his manor! Then could he
shoot us f We would put him to the test, and prove your boasted
"crack shots " was a nonsense. France would then triumph, as she
has always triumphed. Is she'not Civilisation P And is'not Civilisa-
tion another name for Triumph? If you do not believe me, ask
VICTOR HUGO. It is his affair.
When we reached this assassin "Gentlemans-Ridere " he explained
himself to us. He did not wish to shoot us. It was not to be a duel,
but'a bargain. A bargain! You are miserabks, you are touts, you
are a nation of shopkeepers! The advertising assassin wished to let
his shooting at so much a'month! The advertisement was an insult,
a nonsense 1
But were we to be baulked P. "We had come to brave danger—to be
baptised with fire. We made up our minds. We could undergo
something more dreadful, more dangerous, than a duel. We would
go out shooting with one another J Had we not all been provided
with shot-proof under-waistcoats, who would have lived P We fired
at everything P And the result? We made a " bags "! Ah! you
see we know your terms of sport! We have a "Tattersall's
Fran9aifl," we have also a " bags "! This was the contents of our
One Plume of Green Feathers, shot off the jocke hat of M. le
Marquis.
Two Pigs. The Viscount aimed at a stack of hay and killed the
"porkeres."
One Dog. He got in my way as I was shooting at a Cow.
One Finger, belonging to M. le Vicomte. M. le Marquis was the
marksman.
One Sheep. He walked up to my gun to taste it as I was letting
it off.
And one Fox! We all killed him! Hurrah! Hip, hip, hip!
But you insolent islanders are unsympathetic I Instead of carry-
ing us home in triumph, the villagers (whom we had summoned to
our sides with a long solo on our horns) heaped upon our heads
reproaches. Nay, it was worse. M. le Marquis was actually bathed
in the pond of horses! But we will be avenged! Our children
shall avenge us! You hear, our children shall avenge us! Beware
and tremble!
We left the country amidst great " reclamations." and travelled
home. When we got to Leicester Square the 1st of September was
over!
Receive my salutations the most distinguished.
(Signed) LE'CHEVALIEB CANARD.

THE CLERICAL DRAMA.
HE subjoined adver-
tisement is no pa-
rody. It was cut
bodily out *f a
hewspaper:—
WANTED, an
ASSISTANT
CttOtR-MASTER for
Holy Trinity, Bordes-
ley. Duties', to attend
two Sunday si-rvicee
and to conduct two re-
hearsals weekly. Tenor
Toice preferred. Salary
£20. Chorister Boys arc
also required. To those
who possess good voices,
and have a fair know-
ledge of music, £4 a
year can be offered.
The Organist would
also be glad to receive
applications from Ama-
tour Gentlemen desir-
ous of joining the
Choir.—Address, &c.,
&c.
Nor is there any
reason to suppose
this notification to have been the hoax of a wag. But had the
"Theatre Royal" been substituted for'' Holy Trinity," '' Weekly Per-
formances" for "Sunday services," "Conductor" for "Organist,"
"Chorus " for "Choir/' and if "dress" had been inserted before
"rehearsals," would it not have passed for a genuine announce-
ment from the Management of a set of operatic performances? If,
however, Holy Trinity is a Ritualist Church, there is candour, as
far at least as its musical direction is concerned, in advertising
for "Amateur Gentlemen" who may be "desirous of joining the
Choir." But is not this partial? To be perfectly straightforward,
ought not the controllers of the whole concern to advertise also for
Amateur Roman Catholic Priests to assist their Clergy?

BEN-CHIEON'S COUNSELS.
A Paraphrase for the Period.
pupil thus began
(STAFFOHBITS, plumed to pose in battle's van) :—
Aspiring youth, well worthy of my pains,
Ton now are free. Now grasp yourself the reins;
The Commons' Chariot all alone control.
I drive no more, for I have gained the goal:
A Crbwn^-of strawberry leaves, notparsley — calls.
My wearied footsteps seek serener Halls,
Where, far from press of Party's fiercer frays,
I trust in dignity to end my days.
Tet hear, STAFFOBDTTS, hear, before we part,
A few 'cute wrinkles on the Leader's art!
Not now the day of demigods indeed,
Tet may you find my maxims worth your heed:
Though HABTrNGTONTOS no HECTOR be,
Tou no ACHILLES, some shrewd fights yon '11 see.
So listen, ere the embattled hosts approach,
To the experienced counsels of your " Coach."
These are the arms which smote PEELIDES proud,
And whose mere menace meaner warriors cowed.
This is the sword oft crossed with PAM'S sly steel,
And whose keen point made e'en GLADSTONES feel.
So Titan thews. — yet lither limbs are few;
No ponderous glaive, — but then its temper 'a true.
'Tis not from length of limb all victories flow,
Not to sheer biceps all our force we owe;
Long odds by art we lessen or remove,
And skill and patience poorest plights improve.
80 have I fought, so 'gainst defeat made head,
And so my hosts to slow, sure victory led.
Think not, STAFFOKDTJS, that your happier fate,
Forces less few, less faint, ana foes less great,
Can fix your rule. New " CAVES " may yet be found,
Tour serried ranks with discord may resound.
Heed your Gymnasiarch, therefore. He goes hence,
And may not leave you all his skill of fence,
His tricks of feint and parry; yet you 've seen
His style, STAFKORDCS,—and you 're scarcely green.
Tour sword-arm slight, trust not to swashing fierce,
But cool dexterity of carte and tierce.
GLADSTONTCS, iron-thewed, like THOB may smite—
] 've stood, or stayed, his strokes in many a fight;—
BOBUS the trenchant cuts and thrusts like flame-
Full oft he 's matched me at the Sworder's game;—
But, though they fall in thunder, flash as fire,
Cool fence the doughtiest blades may foil or tire.
Tet watch those twain, GLADSTONIUS chiefly. He
Now fells his oaks or tills his glebe with glee;
Music and verse and lettered, ease control
His ancient ardour, and make soft his soul:
But 'ware ACHILLES waking! His the stroke
That my most cunning guard top often broke;
And his the strenuous foining, fine though fierce,
Through which my point might prick, but scarce might pierce.
BRFMMIO'S stork sword-play now is seldom shown,
But dodpc his onset, would you hold your own.
The rest I pass. No youthful Champion yet
Recalls the daring days I half regret:
/fought young heroes; equal war you '11 wage
With mediocrities of middle age.
At least, pro lent., and after—who can say 'f
'Tis yours to arm for the immediate fray.
Aim not at tasks too arduously great,
Choose those where tact and patience wait on fate.
GLA.USTONITJS overleaped himself, and fell,
And well you know his blunder served me well.
That third, stiff Irish wall, with Bungdom-Dyke,
Brought even him a cropper. Shun the like!
In the long race lash not too soon, nor lag,
But watch the going of the rival nag;
Hang at his withers, let him force the pace,
Then, if he swerve, spur on and win the race!
STAFFOBDUS, learn, what's little understood,
To play the waiting game—it's goal is good.
At once yourself and Party you will bless,
And crown your course, as I do, with—Success!
The highest P That let casuists decide;
At least we win the stakes for which we ride.
Which won, that man's a'muff who owns remorsf
Not to have entered for another course.
TRAVEL TWADDLE.
MODEBN Travellers seem to find such ready sale for the rubbish
they call " Notes," that we may expect very soon to hear of—
An Afternoon in Amsterdam, with an exhaustive analysis of the
Dutch character.
A Morning in Mesopotamia, giving the Author's reasons for
believing in the non-existence of NLMBOD as a historical personage.
A Night in Nigritia.vnth an account of the most obvious pheno-
mena or its Flora and Fauna.
Half-an-Hour in New York, with an exhaustive consideration of
American financial and political prospects.
Five Minutes in the Crater of Vesuvius, with a description of its
effect on the Author's circulation.
Truly SYDNEY SMITH was right when he said, modern travellers
were much like a man who professed to tell you all that happened
inside a house because he had had time to count its windows.
WHO CAN TELL?
"TITLE of Earl to descend to heirs male,
Merely a nominal form of entail?"
How Jo you know? Still, as ever, alive,
Again mayn't a Widower possibly wive '<
And know you no cases of evergreen men
Who were made happy fathers past three-score-and-ten?
If strong enough yet for the State vessel's steerage,
May not a Nobleman hand down a peerage?
Did not a COKE, EABL OF LEICESTER, late-wed,
Leaving a son to be Earl in his stead?
What may or may not happen, 'twere senseless to say,
But then don't assume 'tis too late in the day,
Nor conclude, with undue and unthinking temerity,
That the Beaconstield Earldom won't pass to posterity.
CON. FBOM CONNAUGHT.
Av ye plaze, Sorr, when ought a Monk to sit by a fire f
Shure, when he's cowl'd.

A labourer whom beer and bad tobacco
Had no attractions for, a household drudge
Whom " followers " and finery failed to spoil,
Were such auxiliar to the tribes of toil
As muddled Man most needs. But if I 'm judge
Of Monkey-Mind, my tribe has no affection
For this particular species of " selection."
Men claim us as their ancestors—poor creatures!
Ape parentage is scarce apparent now,
Descent has sadly marred their form and features.
Where is the graceful tail, the family brow ?—
But Servants! Hang it! no egregious Frenchman
Shall make this Ape his henchman!

and a trombone—ajl dreadfully
out of tune. This orchestra is
sometimes reduced to a duet
between the trombone and the
junior horn; the remainder of the
artistes deserting their instru-
ments to forage for half-
pence.
An Old Woman, with
Cakes of an indigestible
character. This person is
in the habit of forcing her
pernicious wares upon
children, and then appeal-
ing to their parents for pay-
ment.
An Organ-grinder, with
an instrument playing five
old comio songs. The front
of his organ is'ornamented
with a panorama of nothing
in particular, which moves
slowly, and [has a tendency
to stick.
Another Organ-grinder,
with a very inferior instru-
ment indeed. His entertain-
ment is strengthened by the
presence (in a cosmopolitan uniform) of a deeply-aggrieved Monkey.
The Monkey is conscientious in the discharge of his official duties,
but evidently (from his demeanour) allows his thoughts to stray far
away from the scene of his labours.
Yet a third Organ-grinder, who howls to his own accompaniment.
His favourite air is " Santa Lucia," which he delivers as if it were
a dirge suitable to the wake of a Hottentot Chieftain. After 11 A.M.
this person is generally under the influence of liquor.
Two Foreigners (dirtv and blasphemous), with a wiry Pianoforte
mounted on a truck. Whilst one of them grinds out (in eccentric
time) " The Conspirators' Chorus" from La Fill?, He Madame Angnt,
the other fiercely demands money from nervous-looking old Ladies.
A very dirty Swiss Boy, with a heart-broken guinea-pig. This
young scamp is importunate, and has the habit of thrusting his
animal before the faces of easily-frightened Ladies and children.
He receives your angriest remonstrances with an impudent grin,
and only moves off on the appearance of a Policeman.
A thick-set, loud-voiced, illiterate person, in a rusty suit of black,
who delivers what he is pleased to consider " Sermons " to a satirical
crowd of holiday makers. His "discourses" are frequently profane,
generally ill-considered, and invariably vulgar.
A Maiden Lady, of an uncertain, or rather of a very certain age,
with " a Mission. In the pursuit of wha,t she considers to be her
duty, she is unduly familiar with young men, rude to old men, and
a nuisance to the rest of the creation.
A Punch and Judy Show, with what the French would call
"risque" dialogue, and an exceedingly melancholy Dog Toby.
A Music-Hail Singer, with a choice selection of music-hall songs.
This person generally puts up at the best hotel and frequently in
the afternoon drives down the High Street in a pony carriage.
Three Foreigners (nationality vague) with a bagpipes and a penny
whistle. They are clad in sheepskins and leg bandages, and are
much given to shrieking and howling in the neighbourhood of rival
entertainers.
A Highland Piper, evidently from the glens of Shoreditch. He
wears the McMosES tartan, and discourses in broad Cockney slang.
Negro Serenaders of every hue. Those conducted by persons
wearing the garb of Punch should be more avoided than the rest.
As a rule, these troupes are less refined than the others. It must be
clearly understood that this is not saying very much for "the
others."
A Woman with a Tray, containing a stock of imitation jewellery
and useless articles ornamented with shells. When this harpy puts
in an appearance, care should be taken to keep an eye upon any
stray articles of apparel that may be lying about.
Some sentry-boxes upon wheels, called bathing-machines. These
vehicles are generally sandy, and are invariably fitted up with
nails so placed that the clothes of tbo bathers may be caught and
destroyed. They have no springs, and are, therefore, well adapted
for the perpetration of practical jokes on the part of the horse-
drivers.
And, lastly, the commonest object on the Seashore is a liquid very
frequently little less impure than our own noble river the Thames,
a liquid that is the attraction of all the poor health-seekers who
flock to its adulterated borders—in other words, the Sea 1

PEERAGE AND POST.
A CoiutEsroN DENT of the Belfast News Letter, reporting current
rumours, says:—
"I hare also heard since my Li-4 communication on this subject (hat the
QUEEN has offered the E.trldom, with remainder, to Mil. EALVK DISUABLI
(the brother of LOKD BEACONSFIELD, imd to whom ho is much attached),
with descent in the mail line."
The Belfast News Letter announces news indeed. The Earldom
of Beaconsfield may be considered as an honour awarded as well to
literary as to political eminence; but were it really true that the
CluF.KN had offered that dignity to the Premier's brother, with
descent in the mail line, Her Majesty's subjects would certainly
think that their Most Gracious Sovereign entertained a very peculiar
idea of the kind of person who is meant by the description of " a
man of letters."
European Want.
WANTED, for the settlement of the Eastern Question, to govern
the Turkish Provinces, and control populations of different races and
religions, an able, energetic, and honest Man, of any persuasion,
who believes everything that all reasonable men believe, but keeps
all other dogmas and opinions which he may hold to himself, or, at
any rate, would not allow them in the slightest degree to influence
his conduct in dealing with the subjects over whom somebody or
other is required to preside who could keep them in order.
Of course Mr. Punch knows of such a person, whom modesty
forbids him to name, and besides who is otherwise engaged.

SEASONABLE SUGGESTION.
You have seen, dear Mr. Punch, that the venerable
H./UM. RUSSELL has added to his reputation for episto-
lary writing by a letter about the Bulgarian horrors, to
the Times, wherein he says:—
"It is necessary to stop the atrocities in Turkey with a stronp
hand, and if the Minister for Foreign Affairs dors not do this,
Parliament must interfere. It is for this reason that I consider
an Autumnal Session of Parliament to be necessary."
And, dear Sir, note in the communication above-quoted
a charm in general supposed to be peculiar to youth,
directly contrary to that mistrust and suspicion com-
monly thought to characterise advanced years. That
is, the charm of innocence. I wonder what LOUD BKA-
CONSFIELD said and did when he read the foregoing pro-
posal for an Autumnal Session? He now is an Earl too,
and bound to deport himself as such, therefore cannot
condescend to undignified language or gestures. But
must he not have taken a mental sight, and inwardly
asked whether his noble friend saw any green in his
eye? The Premier's stars hare been fortunate, and
especially in the coincidence between the storm aroused
by the Turkish barbarities and the Vacation. There is
no Opposition now to extort avowals or admissions, or
inconvenient disclosures, and to move a vote of cen-
sure, or a resolution for the recall of SIR HENBY ELLIOT.
But this is what EABL RUSSELL would advise KAHI.
BEACONSFIELD to have. In five months' time the storm
will probably have blown over, and something lucky
have turned up. An Autumnal Session! Doesn't the
fine old Whig Veteran wish he may get it P The idea,
still more the proposal, of such a thing, betokens a
heart indeed incapable of guile. O sancta limplicitas
of a green old age, and a mind untainted, with all its
experience of what MBS. MALAPROP calls Downey Street!
It transcends even the simplicity of a babe and
SUCKLING.
P.S.—And fancy the possibility of an Autumnal Ses-
sion in the height of the shooting-season!

Development—Notes on Types—My Carman—About Bray—

'AFPILY it is a very
Sretty line from
ul il in to Bray:
short and sweet.
A Country Gen-
tleman gets into
the carriage with
me, and talks of
the London sea-
son, of the Operas,
of the Zoo, of
Skating Rinks—
of London topics
generally. I turn
his attention to
Ireland. He ig-
nores Ireland. I
take for granted
that he is, at
heart, a Home-
Ruler. He is nei-
ther at heart, or
head, anything of
the sort. He hopes
that " we" (he is
speaking of Urn-
self and country)
"never shall have
Home-Rule."
"Not a Par-
liament, "I ask,
"on Stephen's
Green?"
I hazard the
mention of "Stephen's Green," being entirely unacquainted with
its locality. Nor do I ever remember having met with any account
of the particular STEPHIST from whom the Green originally took
its name. However, I need not trouble myself as to the history of
Stephen's Green, as my companion scorns the idea of an Irish
Parliament, either on Stephen's or anybody else's Green.
"What 'ud we do with a Parliament P We 're not a people to
govern ourselves at all."
I am silenced. As an Englishman in Ireland, I compassionate
my companion, just as I should a French Anglophobist, who
will insist on decrying all his own institutions, praising ours, and
refusing to speak the language of his own native country.
I want to meet a genuine Home-Ruler, or a hot-headed, warm-
hearted Fenian. My notion of Ireland has been, up to now (thanks
to a course of novels, and English newspapers), that all Irish were,
au fond, the deadly foes of England; that they were pining for
their liberty — pining to repeal the Union, and to demonstrate,
actively, that they, equally with the rest of BRITANNIA'S family,
"never, never, never would be Slaves"—and certainly not "here-
ditary bondsmen" to their brother Britons.
My fellow-traveller points out what a pretty country this is, with
the villas dotted about amonj? the trees, and the view of the Bay on
our left. I am obliged to him for the attention. Then he speaks
of Bray. "A charming place," he says, "but 'tis a pity 'tis in
Ireland. We do nothing with it. No, Sir, we 're behind Time."
His last remark refers to his country, not to the train.
He gets out before I can pursue the conversation.
If this is a specimen of a genuine son of Old Ireland, then I am
disappointed.
I had expeoted to meet with patriotism everywhere. I had ex-
pected that sympathy from a Saxon would have been like the
proverbial "praise from SIR HUBERT STANLEY." It might have
been received by Irishmen suspiciously at first, but, after a while,
it would have been welcomed with effusion. No; if I come to
Ireland inclined to be more Irish than the Irish, I shall return to
England to be more English than the English; unless I succeed.in
finding the realisation ot my ideal of an Irishman in Ireland, that
is, a thorough-going, warm-hearted, impulsive, anti-English-rule,
old-fashioned landlord, residing on his own estate, and, being con-
tent to chance his rents, beloved by his tenantry. If I do not come
across this typical Irishman, I shall regretfully note down that,
like the gods of the heathen, they are all gone out of the way, and
there is none that is good for anything—no, not one.
Bright, cheerful, and pleasant is Bray (where the train now stops),
both landward and seaward. "Ho! there! an outside car!" Or,
stay! First let me consider. I want to see all of the country I can
this afternoon, "twixt one and six, before going on to Rathdrum
—a first flying visit (all through PLTTMPTOW AND SPBY, who may
be, even now, telegraphing to me at Dublin to oome up and be
examined), just to prospect a route for the second.
For such a drive as I require, an outside carman might ask one an
"outside price."
Happy Thought.—Consult the Station-Master. He knows. I
look round to ascertain where his offioe is, or if anybody is there
of whom I can say at once, "This is the Station-Master!
I am the solitary arrival at Bray; and all the oardrivers outside
are doing their best to arrest my attention, by winking, waving their
whips, and touchingtheir hats.
"A cy-arr, your Honour?"
"This way, "Sorr! An outside cyarr?"
"Want a cyarr, Sorr?"
A red-haired, red-whiskered, red-faced 'man in a dirty white
overcoat, slips in, cautiously, through the station-gate. Evidently
he is risking something in passing the boundary of the railings.
He has a whip in one hand, while with the other he touches, a
weather-beaten, shapeless wide-awake. He is bowing, and sidling-
up to me, addressing me in an insinuating whisper, as if he were
really putting me up to a good thing, "Me cyarr's there, Sorr!"
he says, pointing with his whip over his shoulder; "ye '11 be fronting
a eyarr, maybe, for the Dargle and Po'rsooort. Te'll take me,
Sorr?"
"I must see the Station-Master first," I reply, somewhat sternly,
thinking that this will settle him.
He whispers, anxiously—as though he were tempting me to some
horrible crime—uncommonly like Danny Mann proposing the murder
of the Colleen Bawn to Mr, Hardress Cregan,—"Ah, then, Sorr,
ye '11 promise ye '11 take me. Sorr, when ye 've seen him?"
"I don't know. Where is he?"
"Sure, Sorr, he '11 be forenenst there, Sorr, somewherea," pointing
out vaguely up the line; "but I think he was on the thrain that's
gone down this mi nil." Then, having, as he considers, demonstrated
to me the comparative improbability of an interview with the
Station-Master, he resumes his most insinuating tone, and whispers,
"I '11 drive yer Honour out to the Dargle and Po'rsooort, and ye 'll
see him whin we come back."
A porter, passing, directs me to the Station-Master, standing by
a gate. For the moment my confidential Carman appears con-
siderably disconcerted.
I walk towards him, followed by my insinuating friend, whose
confidential manner now changes to one of earnest entreaty: "Ye '11
not forget me, Sorr! mine's the cyarr, Sorr! I '11 take yer as chape
as anny of 'em, Sorr!" Then, as I leave him behind—for, evidently,
he doesn't like to venture too near the Station-Master—he says, in an
imploring whisper, "Ye '11 mind, Sorr, ye 've promised me ye '11
take my cyarr, Sorr. Ye will, Sorr P" Then being compelled to
retire by my advance towards the Station-Master, he concludes with
a master-stroke, as though a bargain had been struck between us.
"Ah, then, God bless yer Honour! 'Tis me oyarr ye' 11 take, God
bless yer Honour!" he says, with an air of pious gratitude, that
seems to overwhelm me with thanks for having sivad him and his
family from starvation by employing his car for the afternoon. My
heart^ which is soft, and remarkably impressionable, is touched,
and I am just on the point of turning, and telling Mm that I will
avail myself of his services, when I fancy I hear the rippling of an
imperfectly suppressed titter, among his fellow-carmen at the rails
outside, who, it appears, have been watching the scene with in-
tense enjoyment, ready to pounce on me, as a victim, should their
more adventurous companion fail in his object.
Happy Thought.—An incident in a " Sentimental Journey."
Civil Station-Master introduces me to a most respectable Carman
of a most decidedly Hebraic cast of countenance. Did I not know
him to be an Irishman, I should describe him, offhand, as a respect-
able Jew-farmer. I am certain I could find his counterpart in any
flower-shop in Covent Garden Market, or in any ready-made tailor
establishment, or in a West-End auction-mart, or old furniture-
shop. His costume only is Irish. His old-fashioned dark-blue,
tight-sleeved coat, with big side-pockets, his red pocket-handker-
chief necktie, his proud prodigality of xhirt (wherein lies the essen-
tial secret of his respectability), and his low-crowned, broad-brimmed
ancient beaver—which he has, apparently, been at some pains to
brush the wrong way—are all characteristic accessories of a picture
most decidedly Irish. Yet I have seen a duplicate of this man—
clothes and all—in Cornwall. Only, his nose (I mean as the Ollen-
dorf system would explain it, "the nose of the man in Cornwall")
was not so Judaically developed. Perhaps the man wasn't quite
finished. At a ripe age, his nose would be quite a piece of Mosaic
work in itself. (This I should note as a genuine, if rare, instance of
"Typical Development.")
Happy Thnuffht (for "Typical Developments").—Nature, like
History, repeats herself.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I feel inclined to address my friend as " ME. O'SoLOMONS." I am
not, as it happens, far out. His name, he informs me is ME.
O'StrmvAi?; and, as I hear him answer pleasantly to the name of
"JEEBY," I fairlv conclude that on his card would be inscribed
"MB. JEREMIAH O'SIILIJTAN." Now, if ever there were a genuine
Hebraic pncnomen, it is "JEREMIAH." It is grand, it is lofty.
"JEREMIAH the Prophet" is lofty, noble, grand. But reduce it to
"JERKY," and it is at once Irish and familiar. To the words of
JEREMIAH the Prophet (I mean apart from our traditional knowledge
of such a person) you would listen with profound reverence. To
JERKY the Prophet you would send six stamps to his office at
Boulogne-snr-Mer, and request his list of good things for the next
Spring Meeting, by return of post. This is indeed a subject which
may give quite a new torn to my work on Typical Developments,
which is to be not for an age, but for all time.
Happy Thought.—Does 0'Srai.rvAN (or O'SULEIMAN or O'SoLO-
MONS) belong to what LORD BEACONSFTELD would (years ago) have
called "the Hebrew Caucasian Race," or, rather, "the Hebrew
Cork-Asian Eaoe " P
MR. O'StrLLTVAN's car is a model of what a car should.be:
harness and plated rail highly polished; a tiger-skin rug thrown
over the seat for the passenger's comfort when cold; and a fast cob
that can face a hill bravely, and descend safely.
Brag.—Just one word. My companion in the train was right.
I regret being obliged to admit it. As regards Bray, he was right.
Why, if Londoners could only have such a little marine Paradise as
Bray, within thirty-five minutes' rail of the Metropolis—which is
the time occupied in the journey between this and Dublin—what a
Brighton it would be!! If such a place were the same distance
from Paris, would Trouville have a ghost of a chance? But here at
Bray, which, for colour and situation, is an Irish Dawlish, with
Dublin forits Exeter, hardly anything—i.e., nothing " to speak of "—
has been done. *»•'
An intelligent gentleman, with whom I got into conversation
while taking a turn on what one of these days will, perhaps, be "the
Promenade by the Sea," tells me, in reply to my enthusiastic praise
(for 1 have fallen in love with Bray at first sight), that " the
drainage ..... ahem!" Impossible! Is it the old, old sea-side
story once again? Or have I come across the only cynic in Bray?
If indeed it be so, then I tear myself from thee, my pride of the
Sea! Beautiful Bray, I must away!
Happy Thought. (Hamlet at Bray.)—" Break, break my heart;
for I must hold my "—nose.
But for scenery, for excursions by land and by sea, for champa gney,
exhilarating air, for " local colour " as rich as the coast of Devon,
and for country quiet, with town life within three-quarters of an
hour's rail, commend me to Bray. Were I an Irishman and a
millionnaire—say, for example, MISTER 0'RoTHSCHn.D—I would buy
Bray, and entrust the management of it to those distinguished for
liveliness, even among " our lively neighbours," who have brought
to such a pitch of perfection the amusements of Boulogne, Dieppe,
and Trouville. I would send for the new Race game, from Dieppe
(an enormous success this season), and at the end of five years
MK. O'RoTHSCHiLD, of Big Bray, would buy up all the other
Rotbschildren in Europe.
But MR. JEREMIAH O'SuixrvAN is nourishing his whip.
The only object of interest that positively strikes my eye, and
impresses- itself on my memory, is a large box, fixed to the wall,
about four feet from the ground, labelled in very large type,
"MR. O'TOOLE'S LETTERS."
It is impossible to avoid standing in'front of this letter-box, and
meditating on MR. OToOLE's letters." Of course Mil. O'TopLE must
live far away among the mountains, in perhaps some glorious ruin
of an ancient palace (for the O'TooLES were Kings of Ireland, as
were several other people as well), and'making a descent on Bray,
to take a sniff of civilisation (I am not thinking even of the drainage
question, which would not interest ME. O'TootE), and pick up his
letters. Does he come for his letters himself, in all the pride'of
his ancient royalty, or are there any. reasons why the O'TooLE
should not come in person? Has he never yet bowed his proud
head before the'Tyrant Saxon,'and consequently does the great
O'TooLE send DAS, the faithful piper of the clan into the station to
fetch the letters, while his Chief awaits him at the hill-side, out of
the town, and.then retires to the fastnesses of his native mountains
to decipher his correspondence? Methinks I see ....
"There '11 not be time, Sorr, for the Dargle, the Waterfall, an'
Po'rsconrt, an' be back here again by sivin, barr'n ye come now,
Sorr," says MR. O'ScLHVAH, who has left his car, in order to arouse
me to action.
In a crack of the *w hip we are away.
AND PARASITE.
WHKf -would you think of looking for a flea in a Kentish field?
Whenever you go to catch it on the hop.
SUICIDE IN THE SOLENT.
f^ EHTLEMEN and others taking an Au-
IT tumnal or occasional holiday are
hereby cautioned to discontinue
the dangerous practice of yachting
or rowing about in the vicinity of
Portsmouth. Shots from
the adjacent batteries at
Browndown are continu-
ally flying over the heads
or plunging into the water
close alongside of those
foolhardy persons who do
not take especial pains to
steer clear and get out of
the line of fire. No atten-
tion whatever can be paid
by the firing party to any
request conveyed to them
through a look-out man
who may possibly be at
hand, to desist from firing
until the idlers who have
strayed into danger shall
have got out'of it, for the
former have their own bu-
siness to mind, and not
the latter's safety. Should
any boat, from neglect of
due precaution on the part
of those on board her. get knocked to pieces in consequence of happen-
ing to sail too near the batteries on the coast of the Solent whilst the
artillery are practising, the survivors, if any, should be liable to be
taken before a Magistrate and heavily fined; and, as for the rest,
their bodies having been recovered and an inquest held upon them,
the Coroner's jury ought to return a verdict offelo de se. For now
everybody is aware that firing-parties do not take cognisance of any
vessels even if notified to them to be within their aim, it is fair to
conclude that all people they may kill must be persons who have
wilfully sought their own salvation. In their case it must be se
offendendo; it cannot be else with anyone who may be killed by a
cannot-shot. in the Solent.

DIRECTION TO CABDRIVERS.
(See Daily JVeios.)
(' it \ w i.i v; along the side of a thoroughfare (say the Strand) in
want of a fare, 11 you happen to see an innocent-looking party
walking in your direction, pull up and inquire if he is going, for
instance, to such and such a Railway (say the Charing Cross)
Station. If he says yes, then ask him if he would mind getting into
your vehicle, because you want to drive that way, but, unless you
are carrying a fare, will not be able to get past the Policeman.
Should he, good-naturedly thinking to assist you, jump into your

down, and, grasping the cab-door handle, request him to pay you a

in trouble and loss of time through resisting your extortion, he will
submit to it and pay you the money; or, should he refuse, you can

HOW WE MANAGE OUR LITTLE AFFAIRS OF THE HEART IN SCARBOROUGH.
MARVELS OF MODERN TRAVEL.
THAT people should put up with a miserable conveyance called a
Cab to take them to the Station, when, by a little agitation, they
might secure carriages as comfortable as the coupe of Paris or the
carojfza of Milan.
That travelled Englishmen, knowing the buffets of the Continent,
should tolerate the miserable Refreshment Rooms to be found at
nearly all the English Stations.
That persons who know the Swiss Railways should rest satisfied
with the miserable accommodation afforded in England to second
and third-class passengers.
That men habituated to Club Dinners should never murmur at
the well-peppered soup, the venerable fish, and the tough meat of
first-class Hotels.
That Family Parties, accustomed to the attention of their servants
at home, should never object to paying a mob of Hotel harpies
extravagantly for imaginary services.
That sea-goers, who have heard of the boats of the P. and 0., and
the steamers running between England and Ireland, should patro-
nise the miserable vessels plying between Dover and Calais, and
Folkestone and Boulogne.
That any sane person, knowing the horrors of a rough two hours,
should ignore the fact that the Castalia starts four times a week
from Dover.
That Englishmen, accustomed to the freedom of their birthright,
should submit to be examined, as if they were the boldest type of
smugglers, on the frontiers of every country in Europe.
That English Ladies, used to the comforts of home, should submit
so patiently to the privations of Hotels in the Mountains, and Inns
in Brittany and other wild parts of France.
That Londoners, who would never walk about Town in anything
but broad cloth and a chimney-pot hat, should perambulate Paris,
Berlin, and Vienna in cheap suits of dittos and wideawake hats.
That Church-goers, who are most devout at home, should treat
foreign Cathedrals as if they were Museums, and regard the wor-
shippers therein as so many wild beasts.
That JOHN BULL, who hates or pretends to hate everything
foreign, should ever go abroad.
Lastly, greatest Marvel of all, that Britons, with the finest
scenery in the world in their own land, should brave all the dirt and
discomfort of a foreign tour to secure a glimpse,of,the picturesque.
ENGLAND AROUSED.
WELL do we to be wroth! Turks still'are'seen
To be the Turks they were in former times:
We wake, and find we unawares have been
Their sleeping partners in their hideous crimes.
But let impetuous wrath not bear away
Indignant Britons. Keep resolved and cool,
Lest into crafty foreign hands we play,
And suffer tricksters Britain to befool.
The nations well may cease to taunt us,~now,
With sordid policy and selfish aim.
Take care, with too impulsive clamour how
You do but further their insidious game.
".Perfidious Albion " is a bygone phrase.
That once familiar cant we hear no more.
Are neighbours who forbear that cry to raise.
More conscious or less spiteful than of,'yort.P
Serene they see how Turkish outrage'works",
In generous British minds unbounded rage.
Let not o'ermastering ire against the Turks,
Ourselves, unwise, in alien toils engage.
This William and That.
THE commemoration of WILLIAM, .Prince ,of _ Orange, in con-
nection with the Pacification of Ghent, coincided with the appearance
of MR. GLADSTONE'S pamphlet, denouncing the Turks. In one
respect the two WILLIAMS stand contrasted, i, WILLIAM OF OBANOK
was celebrated as WILLIAM THE SILEHT,'jwhereas WILLIAM OF
HAWABDEN is distinguished by speaking out.

PUTTING IT PLAINLY.
From a Point of View somewhat loo little considered.

Of hard work, and wants summut like play,

EASTERN OTESTIOIf AKD ANSWER.
Lord B. The Bulgarian atrocities are past recall.
Mr. P. Yes; but your Ambassador isn't.
HINTS TO SPOETSMEN.
Ip'the birds are wild, endeavour to allay their fears by whistling
to them, scattering barley or bread-crumbs in their track, taking oft
your boots, blindfolding the dogs, speaking in an under-tone to the
Under-Keeper, and carefully screening your gun from observation.
If their shyness does not wear off, you must either crawl on your
hands and feet through the wet turnips, or pursue the covey on
horseback until you are near enough to single out the young birds.
A lasso is of no use, and a net might lay yon open to suspicion.
Thick shooting-boots are a mistake. If the ground is wet, your
progress is liable to be impeded by the tenacious adhesion of the
eoil; and if it is dry, there is no occasion for such extraordinary
protection to the feet. Patent leather shoes are not without .their
disadvantages, but, on the whole, perhaps they are the best.
The process of granting game certificates has been very much
simplified of late years, indeed ever since the Gunpowder Plot.
They are no longer required to be issued under the Great Seal, and
HO preliminary questions are now asked—perhaps with a mistaken
leniency—as to the skill and experience of the applicant. In feudal
times, when the laws of this country were JJraconian in their
»e verity, if a Sportsman had shot his dog or his friend, he ran a
great risk of having his certificate suspended, without benefit of
clergy.
Noblemen and Gentlemen, and others who enjoy the right of shoot-
ing over many thousands of acres, may always obtain competent and
obliging Keepers by applying at the Zoological Gardens, or at the
British and South Kensington Museums. Uniform not objected to, if
the pay is good.
The hare is a creature possessed of an excellent appetite, but
singular to relate, it will not touch currant jellv. The expe-
riment has often been tried by the naturalist and psychologist,
but in no one instance, not even in the severest winter, has the bait
been found tasted. Rabbits it might be expected would show the
same antipathy to onions, but such is not the case, at least within
the recollection of any person now living.
Partridges may be lawfully taken and eaten from the 1st of Sep-
tember to the 1st of February, and pheasants from the 1st of October
to the same date; but no penalty attaches to eating bread-sauce all
the year round.
The Game Laws do not apply to poached eggs and Welsh rabbits,
and hare-brained people are not under their protection.
Sporting dogs, such as pointers, spaniels, retrievers, and setters,
require a particular diet during the season. Sponge cakes soaked in
old Madeira, and an egg beaten up with brandy, about 11 o'clock in
the forenoon, are recommended by the best authorities. Also a
little old cheese is considered good for the scent.
Be content with a moderate bag. A few pheasants, six couple of
woodcocks, three or four brace of black game, and capercailzie, with
some snipe, wild fowl, and golden plover, ought to satisfy the most
exacting sportsman.
If the scent is indifferent, sprinkle the ground with a little Eau
de Cologne or lavender water, and burn some pastilles.
The best thing to drink when out Shooting is some cold tea, or a
little oatmeal and water, or whey, or, in extreme cases, gingerade,
taken in moderation.
"Deal in game" liberally. Few people are so overdone with
presents of this kind as to be driven to cry out " Toujotirs perdrix!"
Next to an unexpected legacy, perhaps, there is nothing so welcome
as an unlooked-for hamper. Send vour friends all the young birds,
keeping the old ones for yourself. Never omit to pay the carriage.
You might almost as well omit to pay your Income-tax.
Much depends on the names you give your dogs. In the good old
double-barrel and port-wine days Di, Don, Dash, Carlo, and
Venus did very well; but the march ot intellect has reached the
stubbles and plantations, and demands something more enlightened
and useful. Try how your dogs will answer to School Hoard, Cir-
cumlocution, Centralisation, Cosmopolitan, Evolution, or Instinct.
If these names do not prove satisfactory, you can but fall back on
the old ones.
What a snare poaching is to the poor and the idle who are caught
therein!
Shun battues. If you must be a Butcher, go and join the Turks.
Ghost for Groom.
THERE is, we are informed, by a local journal,—
WANTED a SITUATION as GROOM.—Can make himself generally
useful. Left last situation through -death. Ten and a half and four
years' character. Apply at —, Hill Street, fiyde.
The foregoing advertisement appeared in the Isle of Wight Times,
which is at least not generally known to be a Spiritualist organ.
Where can a Groom, in want of a situation, who left his last
through death, hail from, unless from the happy hunting-grounds?
Spiritualism must be progressing indeed, if servants who want
places can now advertise for them from the other world.

AMATEUR COACHING.
JENKINS CAN'T THINK WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIS WHIP!
NOWHERE!
A NEW ANSWER TO AN OLD QUESTION.
(Commended to the many whom " Turk*" have indirposcd for Touring.)
WHERE shall we go? Why wander? Let us lie
And dream the days away in this old garden.
Bloom sweeter flowers beneath a southern sky?
Towered nobler trees in Tempe or in Arden?
We '11 shirk the eternal Autumn question, urged
By Fashion's flocks, bell-wethered hither, thither.
Why need ire in the hurrying mob be merged?
Where go? Nowhither I
Where shall we go? Observe that Poppy poised
On yonder ridge amidst the golden stubble.
Let that hint answer. Fame haa widely noised
The joys of journeying; tired ones dread its trouble.
If touched by " Turk* " fagged bv the Season's toil,
We long for far niente, full, if fleeting;
May we not find, for once, on English soil
Cheap Lotos-eating :*
Where shall we go ?" To sleep—perchance to dream."
Such restful day-dreams as to sense are soothing;
World-worries whelming in a Lethe-stream,
Calming the pulse, care-gendered wrinkles smoothing.
Ozone anon; an opiate now we '11 try—
Free talk, long lounges, leaf-sounds, fragrance floral,
Which cannot harm, since Nature's lullaby
Smacks not of Chloral!
Where shall we go? A hammock 'neath yon trees
Is this tired traveller's present bourne. Returning,
He '11 beat the copse for filberts, if vou please,
Or cast a fly where the mill-wheel is churning.
Slow wanderings in our woods suit wakening dawri,
And when eve's lengthening shadows bring their benison,
We '11 have, for lazy labour on the lawn,
Tennis, or TENNYSON.
Where shall we go? Nay, be the itatus quo
Our policy at present, a /a DIZZY.
Let geese gregarious nook, flit to and fro,
Restlessly seeking rest, most idly busy.
Cit-haunted sands and tourist-thronged resorts
Shall tempt us not. The modish and the shoppy
For once we '11 shun, and linger where disports
Peace crowned with Poppy.
PASSENGERS IN HALVES.
THE WTtitby Gazette has exercised some readers by a fraction in
the following paragraph:—
"Taip TO LEEDS.—There was a cheap excursion to Leeds on Monday last,
by which 291J passengers from this place availed themselves of the opportunity
of visiting that ancient and thriving town."
They who do not know what to make of half a passenger, have no
children perhaps, and have never had to take a representative half-
ticket. Of course, nobody but a fool would suggest that a man's better
half might be half a passenger. Nor can half a passenger be imagined
a likely result of a railway collision, by which passengers are usually
more than halved, as in the case of a remarkable old woman which
was lately reported by a contemporary to have occurred on the North
Eastern, when—
"An old woman who bad been tiding on the buffer of one of the sets was
found cut to pieces."
In railway collisions things are not generallv done by halves, but
those accidents for the most part arise from things being so done in
railway management.
MAECH AND MUSIC.
AT recent public meetings it has been judiciously remarked that
in dealing with the Eastern Question we must mind how we facili-
tate the march of Russia. Phrase for The March of Russia— The
Rogue's March.

WONDER when a Paris Cabman will accept ids proper fare without
hewing for a pour-boire f
Wonder why it is that foreign railway carriages so furiously
shake, when they happen for a wonder to be going at a rate of more
than twenty miles an hour?
Wonder how many dainty dishes a French chef could concoct out
of what an English Cook would either throw away as waste, or else
steal and sell as dripping?
Wonder how many letters of indignant remonstrance would be
written to the Times, supposing that our railways introduced the
foreign system of imprisoning their travellers in stuffy, stifling
suites d'attente f
Wonder whether Tubbing ever will be acclimatised abroad, and
when, for lavatory purposes, bath towels will then be used instead
uf little napkins P

nuances of etiquette, do not think it worth their while to close their
lips when eating P
Wonder if a British Tourist ever met a foreign Priest out walking
in the country, who was not studying his prayer-book and carrying
an umbrella f
Wonder if French Students, enjoying their vacation, ever indulge
in any exercise more muscular than the athletic sports of dominoes
and billiards P
Wonder what a London Alderman would say, when invited to the
Mansion House, if, instead of luscious turtle^ he»were provided with
a plateful of Potage create au pot, or lukewarm toast-and-water
soup, such as is so frequently supplied at tables d'hute for the
refection of the traveller (
Wonder if a Coachman could be found in any part of France of
sufficient self-restraint to drive for half a mile without making his
whip crack?
Wonder why it is that Foreigners in general, and fat Germans in
particular, like to travel with the windows shut, and breathing such
an atmosphere of smoke as would suffocate a chiinney-sweep?
Wonder if, in spite of all his grumbling when abroad, a man
could anywhere in England spend a holiday so cheaply, or cram so
much amusement into it?
Wonder why it is that Frenchmen put such monstrous collars on
their cart-horses, and what the horses, could they speak, would have
to say about them, and about the little bells which continually
jingle on them?
Wonder in what coming century of progress it will be possible, in
any English county-town hotel, to get so good a dinner, served with
such alacrity, and at so little cost, as may be found at wellnigh
anypaltry inn upon the Continent?
Wonder when a Tourist will be able to take his walks abroad,
without being expected to look at all the lions there?
Wonder when sea-bathing will in England be as decent as it
everywhere is out of it?
Wonder if French polish, when displayed to the fair sex, will
stand such social wear and tear as common British politeness?
Finally. Wonder if a Paris Tourist as much rejoices to return to
the asphalte of his Boulevards, as an Englishman delights to put his
foot once more upon his clean, soft Turkey carpet?
Butchers in Belgium.
THE Times Correspondent, in his account of the rejoicings on the
anniversary of the "Pacification of Ghent," mentions, with reference
to the religious party spirit rampant in Belgium, that, besides
"Clerical washerwomen" (who wash the Ultramontanes' dirty
linen), and "laundresses employed by those of an opposite way of
thinking," there are likewise "Liberal Butchers" and "Catholic
Butchers." Happily, the butchery of the butchers on both sides is
now-a-days confined to quadrupeds; and no meat ;whaterer _is
roasted until dead.
Maladies and Martyrs.
THE "Martyrs to Gout," so called, are indeed, in a sense, martyrs
to the cause of gout—good living. The Anti-Vaccinationist Keighley
Guardians, imprisoned in York Castle, however, have suffered as
enthusiasts for the cause of contagion, and may, with the strictest
accuracy, be styled martyrs to Smallpox.

THE BEER-KINGS OF BURTON.
(See Newspapers.)
HOSE Twain—a narrow es-
cape they had
When we, by their bereave-
ment sad,
At once well nigh were left
to wail;
The two great Brewers of
Burton Ale!
Lo, BASS and ALLSOPP in
a boat,
Together fishing, both afloat;
ALLSOPP his brother brewer's
guest:
Upon Lochquoioh's pellucid
breast.
Behold, BASS hooks a splen-
did trout.
Eager to see him get it out,
ALLSOPP, as though in boats
untried,
Steps over to the other side.
His weight no longer equal-
ises
The little bark, and it cap-
sizes.
There was the boat turned
upside down,
With BASS and ALLSOPP_like
to drown
Together with a brace of. others,
Attendant on the brewer-brothers,
A Gillie of the Erasers' Clan,
And ANDEESON, a Fisherman.
They strove to ri|?ht the boat in vain;
For o'er and o'er it turned again,
All four of them to one side clinging,
Themselves to grief so nearly bringing.
Till ANDEHSOff, with strength of hand,
Presence of mind, and self-command,
At length contrived the boat to right,
By scrambling over opposite.
Meanwhile, a strong breeze landward bore
The lot, and drifted them ashore,
Some distance more than half a mile,
On douce McPHEE's adjacent isle.
McPHEE, thou famous Highland Leech,
The surge was heavy on thy beach,
Hard to get through—but safe they got;
And ANDERSON was tipped we wot.
But think what woe had come to pass,
Had we both ALLSOPP lost and BASS!
If BASS and ALLSOPP too were drowned
A double gloom would reign around.
'Twere like our Premier's perdition
With Leader of our Opposition;
Save that those other men of,note
Were sailing both in one same boat.
Oh what a joyful thing to see
Two of a trade so well agree!
Long live they, whilst we linger here
To drink both BASS and ALLSOPP'S beer.
SPEING SPOETS.
WE have all heard of a "Spring Chicken," but the "JSpring
Hare "—unless, indeed, he be some relation to the proverbial lunatic
appearing in March—is something quite new. An innkeeper at
Hendon has started one. It is coursed by greyhounds; and lor the
spectators, betters, and backers there is all the excitement of the
real thing, with the additional charm of novelty. What an admi-
rable invention for the delicate sentimentality of this rose-water age!
But why stop at Hares apparent—but unreal? Why not, with
the aid of some of the leading " Property-men" from the theatres,
and Toy-mechanicians, and a few other ingenious persons, develope
the idea into something really big P
We begin with a trifle light as Hare: we may end with the noble
Deer in Scotland, or even the Elephant in India.
At all events, from the Hare to the Fox is a small step.
The country would have to be intersected with small lines (at first,
at all events, until the invention was so perfect that these could be
dispensed with), on which the Mechanical'Fox, having been first
properly wound up in covert, would run with just so much "law"
given him as would allow him to be viewed all the way for a good
rattling burst of forty minutes, after which the Field would trot off
to another covert, and be treated to a fresh Mechanical Fox over a
different line of country. Only, of course, this Fox would have to
be hunted by greyhounds. Everybody, who was so minded, could
call out " Tallyho! " and " Yoicks! " and " Gone away!" just as
usual, and make all that amount of noise which goes for so much in
the happiness of Foxhunters. Every M.F.H. who chose to adopt
the "Mechanical Fox" could guarantee his subscribers a run,
weather permitting, for every day in the week. Nay more, he could
name the place,.hour of start, and exact duration of the run, so that
those Gentlemen who are fond of simply coming out to flash their
pink in the sunlight, and then tail home again early, would be able
to ensure themselves a run for their money—a certainty that would
keep many of the " all pink and no-go " school away from the field.
A "Property | Man, or Toyshop keeper, might do well to
advertise—
TO M.P.H.'S AND SPOKTSMEJS".
NO MORE BLANK DATS!!
TRY OUR "MECHANICAL FOX."
*»* Warranted to run for one Season, if used with care,
MESSES. DOLL, Daun, & Co., undertake to send'a Man regularly
every week to see to the Works and keep the Mechanical Fox in
order.
Then again, in our preserves, why not the Mechanical Pheasant,
the Mechanical Partridge, the Mechanical Woodcock, and the Spring
Rabbit? With what a whirr of springs the Pheasant might rise!
And what a good shot it would require to bring him down! The
coveys of Partridges would be wound up all at once and left in a
turnip-field. Their mechanism would be so delicate that the
slightest movement near them would disturb it, and off they 'd all
go at once; or there would be a detention spring, to last for, say,
twenty minutes, until the Sportsman had time to get within shot,
when it would "go" punctually, and the birds would fly off, in
whatever direction thev had been set. Then they would be picked
up in the next field and started again.
No pain, no loss of life, no wanton cruelty, the Sportsman could
at worst only break the mainspring, and be obliged to send the bird
up to Town to be refitted.
We confidently recommend the whole subject to the consideration
of the sporting world at large, and, as also interested, to our
Theatrical "Property" makers and Toy-mechanicians.
Why not, while about it, all sorts of Mechanical Singing Birds?
Why not Mechanical Fish? How lovely our rivers would look with
these bright-coloured metallic fish swimming about, only waiting for
the disciple of IZAAK WALToxto drop his line in with—not a wriggling
worm at the end, oh dear no!—but with a small hook-shaped
magnet to attract and catch the fish, as in the old toy of our nursery
days. According to the power of the magnet and the strength of
the rod, so would be the size of the fish caught.
However, it is for us only to hint. Let those deeply interested
carry out the idea.
THE RAILWAY IDOL.
MODEBN Chapels are going the way of those ancient temples,
which were superseded by other places of worship. This, the Leeds
Mercury informs us, is about to be the case with a chapel obstructing
the—
'EXTENSION OP THE GREAT NORTHERN EAILWAY TO DERBY.—The
Great Northern Hallway's progress into Derby has received a temporary
check. The trustees of a Baptist Chapel in Agard Street bargained, without
the consent of the congregation, to sell the chapel and burial-ground attached
to the railway company for the sum of £3000. The congregation now argue
that, not having their consent, the deed is null and void. The matter will be
taken into the law courta."
But who shall resist Railway Extension P Of course the Baptist
Chapel in Agard Street will have to disappear before the Great
Northern Railway. After due litigation, its site and the adjacent
burial-ground must be traversed by the line to Derby. But see
how the whirligig of Time brings about its revenges; for here a
chapel is to be replaced by a line of rail, and railway sleepers of
another description than those in the burial-ground will be lai 1
down over them; the whole place thus being consecrated to th •
service of a revived Paganism. For the ancients worshipped the
god Terminus, and so does the present generation, but more also.
It does not stop at Terminus worship, but worships the whole Rail-
way. Churches and everything else are sacrificed if necessary to
Railway Extension. The worst of it all is the wholesale sacrifice of
human lives which occurs in collisions.

The shining hours.
Time flies. For instance, look at nic,
And at your Aunt!
As you are now so once were we.
But now we can't
Dance all night long till break of day,
Nor, if we knew
How, at Lawn-Tennis could we play,
Young folks, like you.
Already on the turf you tread
The toadstool springs,
Which, when the Summer's drought has
fled,
Damp Autumn brings.
The grass will soon have got too wet;
Too moist the mould.
Play whilst you can—don't play to get
Your death of cold.
Play whilst those limbs you yet can
use
Free play allow,
Which they will by-and-by refuse;
As mine do now.
Yet, on the sports of youth to gaze,
One still enjoys;
As you may too, in future days,
You, girls and boys.

BAD THING FOR THE BRAIN.
HERE 's a go—that is, here is in effect a go, or measure,
of brandy, gin, whiskey, or other ardent spirit, habitually
imbibed f MR. T. C. KINZETT, at the British Association,
discoursing on "The Action of Alcohol on the Brain,"
said—
"Physiologist* claimed to have proved that alcohol absorbed
into the system not only affected the brain, but also located itself
temporarily there. He had investigated the action of solutions
containing varying per-ccntages of alcohol upon brain-matter
after death, and found that this action consisted in a hardening
not only of the dura mater, but of the whole brain tissue."
If he had only stopped there, what a specious argu-
ment would our philosopher have supplied for alcohol!
From his statement it would appear that spirits, so far
from tending to cause softening of the brain, do just the
reverse. Habitual dram-drinking, therefore, would make
tipplers hard-headed. But MR. KIXZETT went on to say—
"And in very large per-centages, small quantities of the prin-
ciples of the brain were dissolved."
By the action of alcohol upon the cerebral tissue. So
that, after all, we arc compelled to cry( with Cassia, "0
that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal
away their brains:" The spirit of wine washes away
the substance of wit.
LAW FOR LADIES.
SOME people may be a little puzzled by the following
information in the Times:—
"FORFEITED SUITORS' MONEY.—The amount of forfeited
suitors' money in the County Courts last year was £1485 11»."
The only suitors generally understood to have been
subjected to forfeit are those who have broken off their
suits, and consequently become suitors sued. And the
sums they have forfeited are in Ladies' pockets. Besides,
actions for Breach of Promise of Marriage are not tried in
County Courts; the only remedy against defection of
hymeneal courtship being Nisi Prius courtship. British
justice affords no amends for the broken hearts, blasted
hopes, and blighted affections of servant-maids and
widowed washerwomen, unable to afford more than the
County Court limit of legal expenses. De minimi's non
curat lex.
TONGUES FOR TOUEISTS.
THE Long Vacation is drawing to a close, and Parents and Guar-

the education of their respective scions. Should any doting fathers
be interested in the absorption of foreign languages into their
sons' systems, the following Mems from the Diary of a University
Man, who has just returned from a tour abroad, whither he had
gone expressly to perfect himself in European tongues, may be
productive of some reflection.
July.
Left Dover for our Tour. Met American COLONEL X. Y. ZACHAEY
at Calais. Glorious brick. Knew French, and talked for us all.
Gave us quite a twang, and left us devoted to Yankees.
Put up at Grand Hotel. English .Waiter. Saved us lots of
trouble. Went to English Tavern. Excellent Beefsteak for dinner.
Cheese direct from Cheshire. Went to Open-Air Music Hall in the
Shongs Eliza, what they call a Coffee Concert. Two English
Clowns and a man who sang " Tommy, make Room for your Uncle."
English family on both sides of us. Dropped their H's freely. Met
two College chums in the yard of the Grand when we came back.
Went out .'to buy German Dictionary, French Grammar, and
Italian Dialogues. Bought a copy of Punch instead—great fun.
Started for Italy. Capital Guard with the Train: knew English
thoroughly. Queen's Messenger in the carriage; splendid linguist.
What *s the use of trying to speak a foreign language, if you don't
begin in your cradle!
Arrived at Turin. Met the LARKSPUR girls at the Station. Went
everywhere with them. They are all awfully jolly. Quite gorgeous
at slang. Must buy that Italian Grammar and Dialogues. Learnt
the Italian for "Yes " to-day.
On to Venice. How well our Gondolier talks English. Lovely
weather for Cricket or Lawn Tennis. Nothing so jolly here. Old
bricks, and dirty punts they call Gondowlers.
August.
Start for Rome. Fancy a Roman train. What was it 'i All
Gaul, or all the train, was divided in tres paries. Sang comic songs
all the way. Bother Rome! it reminds one of VIRGIL and HORACE,
and all those nuisances. By the way, we must not forget the Italian
Dialogues. Hotel Commissioner, such a good fellow. Has lived in
the Langham for the last six years. Told us a capital American
story. Left the others to go round the monuments while I played a
game of billiards with CAPTAIN CRAWLEY. By Jingo! he does play
well. He never learnt Italian or French, but I have heard he is a
Greek. Speaks English like a Briton.
Meant to have begun Italian to-day; but too hot, really. Go
back by Vienna and Trieste. Better buy a German Dictionary.
CHARLIE'S voice downstairs, by Jove! Hurrah! Off to Vienna.
Go over the Tyrol by night. Sleep all the way.
Vienna. Awfully good. beer. English Parson in same hotel.
Knows the Governor. Wants [me to take him round, and as he
hears I am studying German, will I interpret for him? See him
further first.
September.
Leave Vienna, to escape Parson. The German tongue most attrac-
tive when made into sausages. Lingo simply horrible. Couldn't
learn it if I tried.
Arrived at Munich. Drove round the English Garden. Nothing
English in it except weeds and ourselves. Saw Richard the Third
played at the theatre. Call that SHAKSPEARE? Well! I am parti-
cularly etcetrad. And in German, too! Why don't they learn
English?
Home in time for some Partridges. By the way, wonder what
became of the " Coach" who went out with me? Never bought the
Grammars and Dictionaries, after all. There's nothing like English
if you want to be understood.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [SEPTEMBBB 23, 1876.

A FISH WITH A FAMILY.
FBLEITDS, we are all
acquainted with the
poetical allusion to
fishes that tipple in
the deep." There
are readers who may
imagine the interest-
ing creature below
named by a contem-
porary to be a fish of
more than commonly
bibacious habits :—
"One of the large topes
(or British sharks) in the
Brighton Aquarium has
given birth to eleven
healthy young ones. This
is stated to be the only
instance on record of a
tope breeding when in
confinement. The mother
and young ones are doing
well."
The tope, a fish
not perhaps generally
known by that name,
may, as a species of
British shark being supposed identical with or nearly akin to the
dog-fish (Scyllium catulus], be conceived of as a drunken dog-
fish by the class of readers above referred 'to. Some of these are
possibly even capable of saying that the tope, though common on
the Bntish Coasts, is at the same time apt to be found half seas
pver. From the foregoing announcement in the Evening Standard.
it will be seen that the tope, like other sharks, is viviparous, and
therefore a female; and is a very remarkable exception to the
generality of her species if not sex. SIB WILFRID LA.WSON should
visit the Brighton Aquarium to inspect the tope, and ascertain
whether, notwithstanding proclivities, bad enough for a male, but
truly dreadful for a female, the mother and young ones are never-
theless doing well.

Happy Thought.—Could there be a more enjoyable way of spend-
ing a summer than to have a house at Bray, MB. O'SULLIVAN'S car
for excursions into the lovely country round about, and a small
•ailing-boat in the Bay P
The Dargle, Powerscourt, the Waterfall, all the "objects of
interest" I have done, and am satisfied. I don't want to move on.
Give me Bray, and that is enough. I do not believe, take it for all
in'all.that Bray can be beaten.
A Discovery! I find that the Gentleman whom I met in the
train, and who said he didn't want a Parliament on Stephen's Green,
and added that " We (the Irish) are not a .people for self-govern-
ment"—I say, I find that this Gentleman was an Englishman
residing in Ireland. The Anglo-Irishman is a peculiarly objection-
able person. Now / shoula like to reside in Ireland;; only if I
did. I must share the fate of my compatriots, and become a pecu-
liarly objectionable person. Perhaps I am wrong. Think it out.
But I have no time to spare. I must on to Rathdrnm, or PLUMP-
TON AND SPBY may telegraph to me " Come back!"
Psychological Note for basis of Article in Typical Developments.
—I cannot help remarking how I am, gradually, losing sight of
the Ireland which has hitherto existed in my imagination, in con-
sequence of over-doses of Irish novels, Irish plays, and English
journalistic representations. The novels and plays told me only of
"Ireland as it was," or as they (the writers) chose to say it was.
I had better study Ireland since '98, by JOHN MITCHELL, and D' ABCT
M'G-EE's History of Ireland. Then perhaps I might be able to
strike the balance between the two sides of the question.
Yes, I am becoming acclimatised. Of the process I have been
unconscious. If I was disappointed, at first, because the landing at
Kingstown, and the arrival at Dublin, did not, one after the other,
burst upon me like two tableaux in a grand opera, now, at all events.
I am beginning to understand how ignorant of the place and people J
must have been to have expected anything like the mise-en-scene oi
a Grand Opera on a Landing Stage. I have a whole course of read-
ing to unlearn, and a whole album of pictures to erase from the
ablets of my memory. But, as far as I 've gone, if I never went
iny further tian Bray and its environs, I should be satisfied. And
lere let me pause to recommend those, who another year would
otherwise go abroad, to come from Holyhead to Kingstown, and
hence to Bray.
The Carmen whom I have come across hitherto _are always civil,
never garrulous; ready to give every information in the pleasantest
Dossibfe manner; and in my expenence I never mot with any one
of them who wasn't willing to make a fair bargain for the day.
Of course, as every one declares these Carmen to be the readiest,
and wittiest, of men, I am bound to give them credit for possessing
a reserve fund of humour. Owing, perhaps, to my not yet being
sufficiently acclimatised, I have not remarked the slightest sparkle
'rom these Irish diamonds. I call to mind the proverb about rearls
>efore Porkers, and am aware that a Saxon pig must be educated up
;o the mark before he can discriminate between the pearl and the
>arley. However, here is one specimen. It may be a pearl.
At one place—no matter where—the Gatekeeper would not admit
us unless I had " an order."
"Shure the Gentl'man has the order," said my Carman, winking
to me, with this'aside, "It's the silver order she manes, Sorr."
The next is not a pearl, but eminently characteristic.
I hinted at the probability of our being caught in a storm before
the end of our drive.
"Ah, Sorr," replied the Carman. "We'll have fine weather,
plaso God, from this out."
Imagine an English Cabman, or an English provincial Flyman,
expressing himself in this way, which was all the more striking
from its evident good-faith and absence of all affectation.
Not one of them anywhere but on parting touched his hat politely,
without the slightest sign of servility or obsequiousness, and gave
me more than my change out of the bargain with " Good-bye, Sorr,
and thank ye, Sorr." And " May ye soon be comin' this way again,
Sorr."
My Farewell to MR. O'SvLLirAtr.—"! hope you'll have plenty
of business in the Season."
"There'll be lashins to do, Sorr," replied MB. O'SuixivAN,
cracking his whip. Whether tie pun—a genuine Irish one—was
intentional or not, I put this down as "one to MB. O'SULLTVAN."
On to Rathdrum.—I arrive late. Hotel close at hand. I am
shown into a neat but chilly-looking bed-room.
"Can I have dinner P" I ask, implying a doubt, on account of the
lateness of the hour.
The Landlady, or Housekeeper, or whatever the illigant lady may
be, smiles assent.
''Is it ready?"
"'Tis ready," she answers.
(As a matter of fact I had to wait, being ravenously hungry, for
nearly an hour, but the kind Hostess evidently thought that to have
said "it wasn't ready." would have been a most inhospitable way of
receiving a guest. So she romanced a little. But nope deferred
does not agree with me.)
She does not ask me what I wish to order, so I anticipate any
difficulty by leaving it to her, and she thereupon leaves me to
myself.
A small, shock-headedlboy—the Boots, I fancy—whom I find on
the landing, shows me into the Coffee-Room. There are some people
finishing tea. When they have cleared out, my dinner is served,
and I have the fire lighted.
I say as jovially as possible, " The wine card, please."
The Waiting-Maid stares at me. I repeat my request.
"Is it the wine carte you mane P" she inquires.
"Yes," I answer.
"Ah then," she returns, evidently much relieved by my explana-
tion. "we haven't got one."
There's perhaps no wine—only whiskey?
"Oh. we have wine," she says, and wishes to be informed " what
wine ?" as I can choose from Port, Sherry, Claret, and Champagne,
—and she finally recommends St. Jnlien.
After dinner I am joined by two Irish Commercial Travellers.
They both call for tea, and I am the only one drinking whiskey.
Note.—I have noticed, as a novelty to me, that Yes" is con-
spicuous by its absence from the Irish vocabulary. Also the method
of obtaining information is, generally, as different as possible from an
Englishman's. Now suppose an English " Commercial" wanted to
know if his friend MB. SMITH were anywhere in the neighbourhood,
he would probably ask MABT the Chambermaid in this fashion:—
"MABT, my dear, has MB. SMITH been here.lately?"
And MABY would reply—
"No, Sir," or "Yes, Sir," or " He was here yesterday, Sir, but
has gone on to Bath," as the case may be.
But take my worthy acquaintance the present Irish Commercial.
This is how he manages it.
"MABY1"
"What is it, Sorr P"
"Is MISTHEB O'BBTEff this way?"

And so it goes on, in musical phrases as it were, with varied
inflections for the affirmation, the interrogation, and the conclusive
atnnnation. It looks, in print, like a page from one of ALEXANDM;
DUMAS' novels.
It is difficult to obtain a direct answer from an]Irish servant.
The Master inquires, "BIDDY, who hroke this dish :-"
That dish. Sorr?"
"Yes, this dish."
"That dish is it?"
"Yes, this dish. Did you break it?"
"An7 what "nd I be afther breaking that dish for?"
This fencing-match will continue for some time, until she devises
a new parry for your thrust, in this way:—
I 'm speaking of this dish. Did you break it ¥"
Sure, ye've a dish like that in the next room"—and so on.
Of course the finishing touch, whether for Irish or English servants,
always be that the fractured article, which you can swear you
saw whole yesterday afternoon, was " broken before I came into the
house, Sir."
Servants, after all, whether English or Irish, are very much the same
as they were when DEA^ SWIFT gave them his admirable advice.
MatMntm. At inyht.—One of my companions has gone to bed
1 am alone for a pleasant evening with ME. O'BAGMAN, and Scotch
(not Irish) whiskey.
MB. O'BAGMAN, as an Irishman, warns me against Irish Whiskey.
Another illusion gone!
Wealth leaves its ledger, with qno eye at least,
Fashion leaves May Fair quiet,
And the ghoul Scandal leaves its town-spread feast
To glut on rural diet.
Nob leaves the Row, for ease or enterprise,
According as he's mettled:
Snob leaves "the shop "for "Margit;" leaves likewise
His tailor's bill unsettled.
Railwaydom leaves along its ill-kept lines
< 'pollings for wreckage annual.
Cad 'ABBY leaves on statues, seats, and shrines
His scrawled or carved sign-manual.
TOMJIT leaves school, leaves home no moment's rest
Till his long leave is over;
And MABY (family out) leaves " work," with zest,
To chat with casual lover.
Cit leaves his Club (and maybe takes his spade
Like ancient CIXCINNATUS).
Ton leaves the Town to " persons—haw!—in trade,
And people of no status."
But Toil leaves not the task, nor Pain the bed,
Nor Death his dread dart-hurling:
Autumn, at last, when all his leaves an; shed,
Leaves, with their last wild whirling.
Punch's perennial (printed) leaves still live,

You, like the ancient TIBESIAS, know everything. Tell me,
Sir, inhere has Brompton gone to'? Practically, it has vanished.
Brompton Square and Brompton Crescent are now in South Ken-
sington. Is the Brompton Road still the Brompton Road'( A few
years back we spoke of a friend living in Alexander Square, or
Michael's Grove (a charmingly wooded retreat), as one residing in
Brompton. In fiat, then "wo spoke of a man as we found him."
But noio the same frieud returns me my envelope, requesting me to
scratch out " Brompton," and substitute"" South Kensington." which
strikes me as being only " Brompton" writ large. Sir, where the
white man has once set foot, he has exterminated the ancient
coloured races. Where are the ancient coloured races that so re-
cently dwelt in the groves, the squares, the crescents, and pleasant
places of Brompton? Is there not one aboriginal tribe to make a
last, noble, even if expiring, protest? Will the Brompton 'Busses
vanish? Is there a blessing on those who remove the ancient land-
marks? There may be modern gentility about the name of South
Kensington, but it lacks the sturdiness of "Old Brompton," and
the plain, straightforward, unblushing frankness of "Brompton."
South Kensingtonites may answer, perhaps, and say, "We have
never interfered with Brompton proper." This, Sir, is begging the
question, and the retort will be so self-evident to your readers, that
not another word on the subject will be required from me, who
sign myself, in spite of the South Kensington Museum,
A BBOMPTOX BOILEE.
SCIENCE AND SUPERSTITION.
INASMUCH as the National Assembly of Sages met this year at
Glasgow, it is wonderful that nobody has written thence to say that
the Brightish Association (so called) was nae that bright. A rather
dull gathering was, however, towards the close of its session, enli-
vened with a paper by PEOFESSOB BABBETT, embracing the subjects
of Mesmerism, Clairvoyance, and Spiritualism, whereon ensued a
discussion between the Professor himself and others, including
LOBD RAYLEIGH, MB. CHOOKES, Miss BECKEB, ME. A. RUSSELL
WALLACE, and DB. CABPENTEB, and ending with an altercation about

headed "Superstition in the Nineteenth Century," ever dreamt of
living to see philosophers, physiologists, and naturalists in a great
Council of Science debating the reality of supernatural manifesta-
tions? Are there such things as they dispute about, or have they
eaten of the insane root that takes the reason prisoner? And in
either case are they prepared seriously to consider the question
whether it is possible in the nature 'of things for an old woman to fly

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
For the Use of Young and Old Persons,
SECTION I.—THE HISTORY or THE BRITISH ABHY.
Part I. Introductory.
R. PUNCH had four
military friends
whom he took
great pleasure
in instructing.
COL. CHABLES
was a tierce sol-
dier of the most
pugnacious pro-
clivities; he
seemed to. be
over - ready to
seek the bubble
reputation in the
cannon's mouth.
His patriotism
was intense, and
it was not his
fault that his
sword rusted in
the scabbard
eleven months
out of every
'twelve. It was
generally be-
lieved in his
home circle that
his talents would
have been of the
utmost value to
DON CARLOS, GARIBALDI, andMoLTKE. In spite of Jhis.opinion he had never
left his native land on foreign service, for the simple reason that his regimental
duties had chained him to a spot bounded on the north by Berwick-on-Tweed.
and on the south by Hounslow. He was, in fact, the Commanding Officer of
the Royal East Mudborough Militia. Mr. Punchs second military friend was
ENSIGN EUGENE, of the Volunteers; his third, LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN
GEORGE, of the Grenadiers Green; and his last a dear little fellow, scarcely
seven-and-eighty years of age, called by the Horse Guards and his other
intimates FIELD-MARSHAL SIB FRANK GEEGEE, K.C.B.
When COLONEL CHABLES, of the Royal East Mudborough Militia, was about
fifty years old, he became very inquisitive about the duties of his rank, and
begged hard to be allowed to read the Soldier's Pocket-Book and the Queen's
Regulations. Mr. Punch consented, and he began them accordingly; but he
soon found in the volumes so many hard words and things he' could not Tinder-
stand, that he was quite discouraged; and bringing the books back, said, with
tears m his eyes, that he believed he had better give them up till he was older.
On this Air. Punch laid by his work, and said, " My dear Colonel, rather than
yon should be disappointed in your ardent desire to learn something of yon
duties. I will try what I can do for you myself; and perhaps I may be able to
compile from other military works one that you may find easier to comprehend
than those supplied to you by MESSBS. MACMTLLAN and Her Majesty's.Stationery
Office,"
"Thank you, thank you, dear Mr. Punch," cried COLONEL CHABLES, of the
Royal East Mudborough Militia, in a transport of joy. "Will you begin it
to-day P"
"You must not be too impatient," said Mr. Punch. "You must remember
that I shall have a great deal to do. I must read over several books very
carefully, and I must then select, as well as I can, what I think will entertain
and instruct you. However, I promise to begin as soon as possible, and when-
ever I shall have finished a chapter, I will read it to you m the evening, and
that will be better than listening to one of the Mess stories of our friend
LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN GEORGE, of the Grenadiers Green, which we have
heard so often. After every Section, I will answer any questions you may
ask concerning the subject of it; but you must not interrupt me while I am
reading."
COLONEL CHABLES, of the Royal East Mndborough Militia, ran to inform hi:
brother officers of this kind promise; and as soon as the first Section was com-
pleted, and the welcome hour arrived for the coming of Mr. Punch into the
ante-room, the three younger soldiers eagerly placed themselves by his side.
Even FTELD-MABSHAL SIB FRANK GEEGEE, K.C.B., too, though he was very
old, seated himself on a footstool at Mr. Punch's feet, and listened with great
attention.
Part II. Of the Rise of the British Army.—When JtrLitrs C.ESAB (a General
in the Italian Service) invaded England, several years before the Norman
conquest, the British Army was in a very disorganised condition. The uniform
was neither neat nor expensive, so neither the man of taste nor the manufacturing
tailor were satisfied. The costume of the Infantry consisted of a coat of blue
paint with facings of yellow. A few hundred years later, coats of mail were
introduced, with the effect of enriching the celebrated family of SMITH. Even
n those far-distant days the English were fond of sight-
leeing, and the Battle of Hastings may be said to have
seen lost by the soldiers of HAROLD, who would look, up
jito the sky at the descending Norman arrows. In the
Feudal ages, the British Army consisted chiefly of men-
at-arms and yeomen, who had been supplied to the King
by the Barons as a sort of human substitute for the proper
payment of the Income-tax and the Water-rates. In the
reigji of CHARLES THE SECOND, in consequence of the
extinction of Feudal tenures, the British Army began to
assume its modern shape. The 1st Royals is the oldest
regiment in the Service. It was raised in 1633, and is
now called the Royal Scots. In the scheme of LOBD
CABDWELL, for making the Militia the Reserve to the
Line, it was proposed to attach the 1st Royal Tower
Hamlets to the 1st Royal Scots. Had this p^lan been
carried out, the distinguished Militia Regiment in
question would doubtless have assumed the titles and
uniform of the Royal King's Own Shoreditch High-
landers. The Coldstream Guards and the 3rd Buffs are
the next senior regiments to the Royal Scots—they were
raised in 1660. The Royal Horse Guards (Blue) in 1661.
Their founder, the EARL OF OXFOBD, was a nobleman
fond of solitude and gloom. Hence, when a gentleman
of military appearance seemed to be in low spirits, it
was immediately reported that "he was in the Blues."
It is amusing to notice how long-lived are regimental
customs. Only the other day the officers of the Royal
Horse Guards, true to the traditions of their glorious
corps, actually attended a fancy dress ball, at Marl-
borough House, in the costume of Puritans! It is
gratifying to hear, however, that they kept up the
character they had assumed with as much credit to their
heads as to their hearts. The 100th Canadian Regiment
was added to the Establishment in 1858, and, in 1861
(just two hundred years after the'raising of the Cold-
streams and the Buffs), the 101st, 102nd, 103rd, 104th,
105th. 106th, 107th, 108th, and 109th Regiments com-
Sleted the muster roll of the British Army of modern
ays. And now, having told vou, my dear Officers and
Gentlemen, how the British Army arose, in my next
section I shall have something to say about the duty
one soldier owes to another. I shall attempt to prove
that, though the haughty General may have no head,
the humblest of our privates may yet have a heart full
of the noblest thoughts and (to finish off the sentence
neatly) the very highest of human aspirations.
CONVERSATION ON SECTION I.
Ensign Eugene. Please, Mr. Punch, what are the
highest aspirations of the British private?
Mr. Punch. My dear ENSIGN EUGENE, of the Volun-
teers, the highest aspirations of the British private are
said to be (by the best authorities) for more food, stronger
beer, and less sentry duty.
Colonel Charles. Surely/JMr.'JPuncA, you do notallude
to the Militia. I can assure you, my dear Sir, at mess
every evening! during the training, the most popular
toast after that of Her Majesty the QUEEN is "Wild
Wars and Speedy Promotion." The Assistant-Surgeon
of the Regiment almost cries with emotion when he
proposes it.
Mr. Punch. COLONEL CHARLES, of the Royal East
Mudborough Militia, I feel that m your hands Herne
Bay is safe, and Putney need never 'fear an invasion!
But, before I commence mv lectures, will you, all of
you, tell me why you entered the British Army? Come,
my dear little FIELD-MABSHAL SIB FRANK GEEGEE,
K.C.B.. why did you join 'i
Field-Marshal Sir Frank Geegeet K.C.B. Because
little SIR FRANK was a good boy. His Mamma told him
to join a Hussar Regiment when he was thirteen, and
he has been doing what he has been bid ever since. He
has gone up and up and up in the British Army list,
until now he goes to reviews like a good boy, in top-
boots, a cocked hat, spectacles, and a respirator.
Mr. Punch. Dear little fellow! And you, COLONEL
CHABLES, of the Royal East Mudborough Militia, why
did you rush to defend your eountrv?
Colonel Charles. Because, Sir, I felt that my country
needed defending. Because, Sir, I felt that, unless I
put on a blue patrol jacket twenty-seven days out of
every three hundred and sixty-five, England would sink
to rise no more, and the waves would have to advertise
for a new directress!
Mr. Punch. Admirably answered! And you, ENSIGN

Mr. Punch. Your reply is ingenious, frank, and manly. And
you, LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN GEORGE, of the Grenadiers Green,

Lieutenant and Captain George. Because, Mr. Punch, the Army
happens to be myprofession. I trust you will pardon me if I ask
you a question. Why are you delivering lectures upon the Army?
Mr. Punch. Because, my dear LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN GEORGE,
of the Grenadiers Green, I am a civilian, and consequently know in-
finitely more about military matters than soldiers to the manner born.
Lieutenant and Captain George. Sir, your logic is unanswerable.
I shall be delighted to listen to you with the utmost attention and
courtesy.

A TASTE OF HOME-EULE.
A MEETING of Irish patriots who proved patriotons was held
the other day in the Free Trade Hall, Manchester, to hear MB.
O'CoNifOK POWEB, M.P.. deliver a lecture on Irish Wit and
Humour. Accordingly, MB. BIOGAB, M.P., in the Chair, several
letters were read from MAJOR O'GoBMAN and other Home-Rule
Members of Parliament. In the letters of MAJOR O'GoBMAN, Irish
Wit and Humour might have been expected to be strongly
exemplified, but apparently were not, for nobody laughed, but only
"there was a good? deal of whistling and shouting." MB. POWER,
having then been asked by a Gentleman on the platform whether he
held the views of WOLFE TONE and EMMETT as to Home-Rule for
Ireland, was greeted on rising with prolonged shouts and hisses, on
the subsidence of which he answered he was there not to lecture on
Home-Rule, but on Irish Wit and Humour. His hearers did not
want to be taught what Irish Wit and Irish Humour were. They
soon let him know that they knew.
"A signal was then apparently given from some of the men who had got
upon the platform, and in response to it a free fight ensued between the two
hostile factions composing the meeting. Some of the audience, it is said, had
come armed with sticks and other missiles, which they freely used as weapons.
Chairs were thrown about the platform, broken up, and used in the light.
For some time there was a general scrimmage throughout the Hall."
These were practical illustrations, and striking instances, of Irish
Wit and Humour. But the best hit of them all remains to be told :—
"ME. BIOOAB remained in the Chair, and in the course of the fight he was
struck on the head with some missile, and sustained a scalp wound from
which he bled profusely. He vacated the Chair after receiving the blow, and
was taken from the Hall to the door, towards which there was an immediate
rush, and a scene of wild and indescribable confusion arose."
The blow which broke MB. BIGGAB'S head appears to have been
nearly as effective a stroke of Irish Wit and Humour as he could
have received. Somebody had him there. A head laid open is a
splendid example of cutting Irish satire. He must have felt it.
These witty and humorous proceedings having ended, the results
of them were found Jo,, be that—
"About three or fouf hundred chairs were smashed; the forms were heaped
up in every direction, and a slight injury was done to the organ and parts of
the building."
MB. POWER made a great mistake in representing Irish Wit and
Humour and Irish Home-Rule as different things. The Home-Rulers
quickly showed him they were all one. Home-Rule is manifestly
nothing else than an Irish joke, expressing itself in home thrusts
and home blows. But Irish jokes break bones—when the jokers hit
hard enough. Theirs are the sort of jokes to make you scream, if
you are duly sensitive ; instead of only making you split your sides,
they split your sides for you. The only objection to these sallies of
Irish Wit and Humour is, that there is too much reason to fear they
may be really the death of one.

THE CHEAT PIANO-PLAGUE.
KIND MR. PUNCH,
To please my wife and family, I am staying by the shore of
the much-resounding sea. To please myself, I have selected what
I thought a quiet watering-ulace, unmolested by excursionists, and
remote both from the snobbish and the fashionable world. Here I
fondly hoped to lead a quiet life, and to bask at leisure on the
pebbly beach, undisturbed by bothering boatmen, or by black-faced
banjoed bawlers, or by blatant German bands.
But though Shingleton is quieter than Starborough or Sheepsgate,
I. cannot say my lite here is as tranquil as I hoped. I happen to be
gifted with a good ear for music, and I suffer aural martyrdom by
reason of the gift. I mention it as " a" good ear, for that phrase
is usual; but the fact is, I have two good ears, neither one deaf.
Were I for musical appreciation gifted with but one, I might stuff
it well with cotton, and spare myself the torture to which I am
exposed.
Pity, pray, the sorrows of an ill-starred man. From the moment
when I wake, to midnight at the very least, pianos to right of me,
pianos_ to left of me, pianos in front of me, jingle and jangle.
Graphic as it may be, even this description falls short of the truth;
for a pianist is playing underneath me while I write. When I en-
gaged my lodgings, or " apartments," as she calls them, my land-
lady informed me, and with perfect accuracy, that there wasn't
such a thing as a piano in the house. Tempted by this statement.
I took her first-floor and two upper bedrooms for a month, and made
no special bargain as to boot-cleaning and cruets, which, with hull -
a-score more extras, have since proved rather costly additions to
her bill. The ground-floor then was vacant, but, unluckily, was let
the day after we came, and the next day a piano, upon hire, was
introduced.
The houses built for lodgings have uncommonly thin walls, and a
piano in the parlour is heard well-nigh to the roof. Besides, the
walls of modern dwellings are barely a brick thick; and a piano
which is played at No. 5, Marine Parade, vibrates most unmercifully
through Nos. 4 and 6. To these facts add the further one, that
most young Ladies now-a-days can sing as well as play; and when I
say " as well" I really mean "as ill." Moreover, at the sea-side
they generally practise with the window open, and, having little
else to do except to bathe and read a novel, they invariably practise
some thirteen hours a day.
A heavy tax upon Pianos, to be doubled at all watering-places,
might somewhat abate the nuisance, which grows each year worse
and worse. :Persons guilty of the misdemeanor of playing with
the window open, should be indictable for wilful breaches of the
peace. I am not by my nature of a revengeful temperament, but I
own I feel inclined to punish with severity these feminine offenders,
no matter how penitent or how pretty they may be.
In the hope that the Exchequer may be speedily enriched by the
tax above suggested, I crave your leave to call myself
Yours,
A MAN WITH Two GOOD EABS.
The Wrong County.
NOT Buckinghamshire, but Lincolnshire ought to have enjoyed
the distinction of giving the PRIME MINISTER a territorial title. In

his sparkling novels.

EXEMPLAKY INTOLERANCE.
Ijf a Circular issued by the Spanish Cabinet, Europe is told that
the Constitution establishes Iteligious Tolerance in the interior of
places of worship and cemeteries, but formally interdicts all public
manifestations of heterodoxy, and that:—
"The Government considers notices placarded on places outside the Church
announcing the hours of service to be public manifestations, and interdicts
them in consequence."
Suppose this notification, mutatis mutandis, that is, the places of
worship which it relates to being lloman Catholic instead of
Protestant, had been issued by PRINCE BISMARCK. What invectives
would have been hurled from the Vatican at the head of the
persecutor, with what unmeasured abuse he would have been every-
where denounced by the lloman Catholic Press, and how strongly
he would have been censured in England even by the organs of
Protestant Liberal opinion I The Ultramontanes may thank the
Spanish Ministry for setting the Prussian Government, and every
other, a very bad example of bigotry, which may be imitated to the
vexation of the faithful.
DIGNITY AND IMPUDENCE.
HERE is a precious little piece of kitchen stuff:—
AS PROFESSED COOK AND HOUSEKEEPER. Wages £40.
iA. Unexceptionable character. A private (not professional) family preferred.
That a Cook should state her preference to serve a private family
is a fact that well may exercise the meditative mind. The condition
of the labour market may be clearly guessed therefrom; and the
opinion may be formed that the supply of Cooks at present hardly
equals the demand. The parenthesis may likewise incite some
further thought. Why should a Cook restrict her preference in this
way, and object to serve a dinner for a Doctor or a Lawyer, or any
one whose income is professionally earned? We have smoked three
cigarettes in deep reflection on the matter, and confess ourselves
incompetent to solve the weighty point. If the precedent be fol-
lowed, we may hear of Housemaids advertising that they have a
preference to serve in titled families; and Scullerymaids, in want
of situations, may announce, with all the emphasis of italics or big
print, that Nobody connected tvith the City need apply."

DRIVING LADIES. EXTREME MEASURES.
"IF YOU CAN'T WHIT HIM UP, you MUST LIFT HIM UP, CHAKLKS!"
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(The Winter Theatrical Season commences. He pays a flying visit
to the Queen's, anil briefly reports thereon.)
SIB,
BEFOBE quitting England, you, at a most affecting parting,
strictly enjoined me to represent yourself whenever and wherever
SHAXSPEABE might be " revived." You, then and there, gave me a
standing order ("not admitted after seven"), which I promised
scrupulously to obey.
Hearing then of ME. JOHN COLEMAN, how
Jons COLEMAN, of the Provinces, by the Nine Muses swore
That York and Leeds and somewhere else should see his face no more,
until he had produced SHAKSPEARE'S Henry the Fifth in London,
at the Queen's Theatre, I determined to be in my place on the tirst
opportunity, which, I regret to say, was not on the premiere of the
grand revival.
Whatever may be the result of the Jpresent speculation at the
Queen's, everyone, interested in the prosperity of the English stage,
must wish success to the enterprising Manager from the North, who
has heard mysterious voices in the air crying, "York, you're
wanted!" and, in obedience to the mystic summons, has come up
to make essay of the Metropolis. And, no doubt, MB. JOHN COM-
MAND-OUT old King COLE-MAN, a jolly old soul man, and a jolly old
soul is he—has effected much that is worthy of great praise, and,
where he has failed, he is to be credited with the best intentions—a
fruitful source of failure, by the way,—and sympathised with as
not having achieved his own ideal success.
It is bad, for example, to have to start with such an apology as
catches the eye on the first sheet of his elaborate (and excruciatingly
sneezingly scented) programme, i.e., "NOTICE. As many of the
'set' scenes are of great magnitude, especially the 'Interior of
Westminster Abbey,' public indulgence is requested for such delays
between the Acts as^may be necessary during the first week of this
production" Yes, but surely another two weeks' rehearsal
would have rendered these delays unnecessary, and, despite their
expense, would have, in the end, been a genuine economy.
Again, more rehearsal would have done some good to the invisible
orchestra. As it is, the band plays out of sight, and out of—a good
deal else. Then the men whose duty it is to manage the curtains,
should be rehearsed at their work every day. The directions given
"behind the scenes " should be toned into a lower key (difhcult,
perhaps, where crowds have to be dealt with); and were a pair of
"tormentors" (as the sort of screens are called which conceal the
space between the proscenium and the first wings) added, the effect
for those of the audience who are seated at the sides and in the
front row of the stalls would be materially enhanced. I confess the
illusion of a Knights-in-armour battle-scene is destroyed, as far as
I am personally concerned, when I catch sight of energetic people
in the hats and coats of eighteen hundred and seventy-six suddenly
coming into sight at the wings.
One mistake to my thinking is the retention of the Chorus, a part
fairly declaimed by Miss LEIOHTON. The Chorus is an apology for
the absence, in the time of the Divine WILLIAMS, of those very effects
which it is one chief aim of this revival to place before the public.
Nowadays the occupation this Chorus appears to have gone.
Time, Sir, will not permit me to review at length this revival,
which begins at seven (confound it!—why won't you let us dine
comfortably, MB. COLEMAN F) with the Jerusalem Chamber and
MB. PHELPS, and ends at eleven, or thereabouts. By the way, why,
in the bill, are Nym, Sardolph, and Pistol described as "Irregular
Humorists"? I think it a capital name, and should like to adopt it
myself ; but how are these three "Irregular Humorists"? MB. MEAD,
who plays Pistol, is a regular humorist.
The play-bill consists of eight pages, rather formidable. All the
available talent finds herein a local habitation and a name. This
swells the list with the rank and file. Allow me to offer a sugges-
tion. A French Lord—LORD BOUCIQUAXT—is mentioned in the play,
and is put down in the cast. Well, as MB. COLEMAN has been going
in for descriptions, as for example, "The Irregular Humorists,"
why not give the foreign nobleman the benefit of the doubt, thus,
LOBD BOUCIQTJALT (probably ancestor of the present eminent Irish
Dramatist and Fenian-Liberator, MR. DION jBouciCAULT) "—which
would be interesting to others besides the mere antiquarian.
I hope to'pay the Queen's another visit when everything will be in
VOL. LSXI.

SHIPTON AND SLUDGE.
How long will Justice, blinder than ever, continue to prose-
cute poor old MOTHER Snrprox for telling sixpenny fortunes to
maid servants, and allow charlatans of the "Medium" type to be
treated as magicians by feeble scientists, and their illusions to be
discussed as positive phenomena by little intelligences Y
To the look-up with old MOTUEB SHIPTON! She has no Lecturers
on Anatomy, no Professors of Psychological Economy, to speak,
protest, or lecture, in her favour. To gaol with her! She has made
a servant-girl happy for an hour for the small sum of- sixpence!
Nothing can be too bad for her when we think of the superstitious
ideas such conduct may engender in the lower classes.
But SLUDGE, who is a Doctor—a genuine one, or he would
not use the prefix—is not to be treated otherwise than as the
respected and admired exponent of a science yet in its infancy. He

Punch knows it is useless to argue with enthusiasts, but he asks,
f witchcraft is to be treated as an imposition, whether obtaining
money under false pretences in the drawing-room is not as punish-
able as doing so at the area, and whether Magistrates ought any
more to tolerate impostors extracting guineas from well-to-do

MR. PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
SECTION II.—OF THE Dorr OF TUB OFFICER TO HIMSELF.

UEN Mr. Punch appeared to
give his promised lecture, his
four military friends hastened
to greet him. His pupils ap-
peared in different costumes.
COLONEL CHARLES, of the Royal
East Mudborough Militia, wore
his silver-laced overalls and
lerfe\est. ENSIGN EUGENE, of
the Volunteers, on the con-
trary, appeared in a motley
uniform, composed of a regi-
mental tunic, a pair of fancy
tweed trousers, and a straw
hftt. LlEOTBNANT AND CAP-
TAIN GEORGE, of the Grenadiers
Green, was satisfied to appear
m a black smt of evening costume. FIELF.-MARSHAL SIH FRANK GEEGEE, K.C.B.,
vure his respirator and decorations. The dear little man, was seated in a
perambulator.
• "My good boys," said Mr. Punch, " before I com-
mence my lecture, will you kindly tell me why you
have selected the uniforms in which you have been
good enough to appear P"
COLONEL CHARLES, of the Royal East Mudborongh
Militia, was the first to answer. He replied, with a
slight blush, "It has occurred to me, Mr. Punch,
since we held our last conversation, that it would be
possible to mistake me for a civilian did I not make
the very most of my uniform."
"This is the regulation shooting dress at Wimble-
don," proudly responded ENSIGN EUGENE, of the
Volunteers.
"We wear mufti at mess, to distinguish us from
the Army," drawled LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN
GEORGE, of the Grenadiers Green.
Mr. Punch turned to FiELD-MiHSHAi, SIR FRANK
j GEF.GEE, K.C.B., and was horrified to find that.the
poor little fellow had cut his fingers with his sword.
"My poor, sweet little man!" cried Mr. Punch,
compassionately, " how did you manage to draw that
dangerous weapon?"
"Little SIR FRANK doesn't know!" sobbed the
venerable innocent. "Little SIR FRANK only drew
his sword once before; and then he was a naughty
subaltern, and got fined a dozen of champagne be-
cause he did it m the ante-room. Little SIR FRANK
will be a good boy, and won't do it again."
Sticking-plaister was produced, and peace restored;
and then Mr. Punch commenced hia lecture:—
Part I. The Commanding Officer and his Subor-
dinates.—The first duty of the Officer is obedience to
his superiors; the second is to maintain discipline
amongst his interiors. According to the Queen's
Regulations (Sect. 7), he should " not only enforce by
command, but should also entourage by example, the
energetic discharge of duty, and the steady endurance
of the difficulties and privations which are inseparable
from military service."
Thus, a Commanding Officer, when a Sub-Lieu-
tenant is sent to join his regiment, should seize as
many opportunities as possible to attract the attention
of his subordinate. When he sees his recruit coming,
he should immediately commence practising the goose-
step with perseverance. It will be as well for him to
appear to fail once or twice in the attempt to perform
this elementary, but difficult, manoeuvre, so that the
recruit may be encouraged to make the necessary
efforts to master the subject. At other times it will
be as well if the recruit finds his Commanding Officer
hard at work studying the Field Exercises, Part I.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
By these and like means a Colonel of ordinary ability will soon be able to
accustom his Officers to steadily endure "the difficulties and privations which
are inseparable from military service."
As one of his duties is to maintain " a proper system of economy," he should
encourage the Mess Committee to order the cheapest wine. He should accustom
himself to making the following observations in a hearty tone of voice:
"Really, this Cape sherry is excellent!" "I have never tasted a better glass
of champagne, at twenty-four shillings a dozen, in my life!" "On my word,
this glass of ginger-wine is far more wholesome than the most expensive port!"
Should it he necessary, he will always be able to procure the proper antidotes
from the Surgeon attached to his Regiment. In conclusion, the Colonel should
recollect that he is regarded by the Authorities at Pall Mall as the father
of his Regiment, and as a father who is expected to educate and maintain his
children at the very smallest possible expense to the general public.
Part II. The Inferior Officers and their Commander.—As it is the duty
of the Colonel to regard his Officers as his children, so, in like manner, is it
the duty of the Inferior Officers to look upon their Commanding Officer as their
parent. The Majors should never perform the smallest duty without con-
sulting their chief. When engaged in battalion drill, they should invariably
ask their Colonel to explain his orders, and the way to obey them, before they
are issued to the Regiment. The observance of this rule will generally save a
great deal of confusion and a constant reference to the Red Book. As it will
be the duty of the senior Major to ride side by side with the Colonel at the
head of the column on the line of march, he should invariably store his mind
with a choice collection of good stories and witicisms with which to amuse his
superior Officer when the toils of the day are over. As, on these occasions,
they will be riding immediately in rear of the band, it will be as well if he
provides himself with a speaking-trumpet. Thus armed, even the smallest pun
should have its due effect.
The Company Officers should have the fullest confidence in their superior,
and should do nothing without his knowledge. Thus, as the proper manage-
ment of practical joking is left, by the Queen's Regulations, m the Colonel's
hands, Officers should invariably make their Commanding Officer the hero of
their frolics. Thev should also never " raise funds through the agency of money-
lenders and bill-discounters " without asking their Colonel to lend the influence
of his name to the financial transaction. As their Colonel is directed " to dis-
countenance anv disposition in his Officers to gamble," they should invariably
decline to join nim in.a game of whist at stakes higher than " fiver points and
a pony on the rub."
By these means the Commanding Officer and his colleagues in command
may live on the terms of a very happy family.
CONVERSATION ON SECTION II.

Ensign Eugene. Please, Mr. Punch, can you tell me-who the Commanding
Officer of a Regiment is'?
Mr. Punch. My dear ENSIGN EUGENE, I am very pleased to find that you
are already beginning to take an interest in military matters of importance.
However, as your question is one of rtn elementary Character, I will ask your
brother Officers to answer it for you. Now, my dear little FIELD-MARSHAL SIK
FBANK GEEOEE, K.C.B., can you tell me anything about a Commanding Officer?
Field-Marshal Sir Frank Ccegee, K.C.B. Dear little SIR FRANK is a
Colonel himself. He was gazetted a Colonel, and was told he might wear a
pretty uniform, and draw a nice little salary. Some day, dear little SIR FRANK,
if he lives to bo a very, very old man, may see his Regiment. Won't that bo nice'}
Mr. Punch. My sweet little man, 1 recollect the Regiment of which you
are nominally in command, is now serving in India. And now, LIEUTENANT
AND CAPTAIN GEORGE, of the Grenadiers Green, -frho do you say is the Com-
manding Officer of a Regiment?
Lieutenant and Captain flenrge. Off parade, the man who keeps the regi-
mental drag on the Sergeant-Major.
Mr. Punch. Do you know, my dear COLONEL CHARLES,
of the Royal East Mudborough Militia?
Colonel Charles. In our Service, Sir, the battalion is
usually commanded by the Adjutant.
Mr. Punch. So I have heard; and a very grave
mistake, too. The Adjutant's duties should find him
better employment. A Captain has no right to assume
field rank. Now, you have heard the hints thrown out
by your brother Officers, my dear ENSIGN EUGENE, of
the Volunteers. Perhaps you may be yet able to answer
your own question for yourself.
Ensign Eugene. I suppose the Colonel should com-
mand his own Regiment.
Mr. Punch. Theoretically, quite right, my dear En-
sign ; but, as a matter of fact, the Regiment is generally
commanded by the Colonel's wife!
BEITISH INTERESTS—AND PEINCIPLES.
"Unquestionably there is a large party, a large portion of Her
Majesty's subjects whose thoughts and sentiments are attracted
and absorbed by other things than the maintenance of the per-
manent interests of this country, or the maintenance of peace.
. . . . The country, in some of its exhibitions of feeling, has
completely out-Heroded the most extravagant conceptions."—
The EARL OF BEACONSFIELD at Ayltsbwy.
BULL to BEACONSFHSJ).
BRITISH Interests, BEN? Precisely so,
Bound to look to them, I quite agree;
But must say that I should like to know
What your present views of them may be.
Mine have changed, I own it. Summons sharp
Set mo thinking; the result you 've seen.
'Tisn't now the time to sneer and carp,
Best speak out, BEN; tell us what you mean.
British Interests, BEN? Are they bound up
With cool minimising of such work
As has made us all on horrors sup?
Tied to toleration of the Turk'?
Can't quite see it, BEN; but if they be,
British hearts must sicken so to find them;
And the only question left to me
Is—how hist and soonest to u;ibind them!
British Interests, BEN? They may be bought
At a price I 'm not prepared to pay.
Fight for them I would, as I have fought,
Though I 'd rather keep from further fray.
But between the Sword and Shame, you see
There is never need of pause for choice.
Better battle than complicity
With foul foes of freedom! That's my voice I
British Interests? Some have vented bosh—
Cold as well as hot—I 'd fain shun spasm.
"Sinister ?_" No, BEN, that taunt won't wash.
Don't claim fun/on for " enthusiasm."
But Batak! Can't well " out-Herod " that!
Keep cool head by all means, step with care;
But I won't have part or lot—that s flat!
With the brutes who played the Herod there.
British Interests? Long we 've hacked the Turk
Selfishly, or prudently, no matter!
But one fixed resolve you '11 find to lurk
Under all this multitudinous clatter.
JOHN declines any longer to lend his name
To the Eastern Moloch of Misrule,
Will not bear his burden, share his shame.
Send that ultimatum to Stamboul!
British Interests? Don't desire to play
Into hands of "sinister" intrigue,
Cynic despot on the scent for prey,
Party wire-puller, or secret League.
Tricked by Russ or shamed by Turk? Faith, no!
Either part to play I 'm vastly loth.
Scvlla or Charybdis choose? Not so!
Want a steersman who '11 keep clear of both.
British Interests? BEACONSFIELD, my friend,
There's your chart, your compass. Can you steer?
Chilly reticence 'tis time to end,
Storm may reach e'en your " serener sphere."
This " commanding sentiment" claims. Are you
Apt to heed that Sentiment's commands?
If so, say so. If not, say so, too,
And—the tiller goes to other hands.

FACT AND FICTION;
OK, Y" BONNT FISHWIVES OF SCARBOROUGH AND THEIR IMITATORS.
MIRACLE AND NO MISTAKE.
SOLON and SOLOMOX, smoking.
Solon. Curious, the appearance of PROFESSOR LANKESTEH'S
exposure of DR. SLAKE, and of MONSIGNOR CAPEL'S defence of the
Lourdes miracles in the same page of the Times.
Solomon. Spiritualism at London and Spiritualism at Lourdes.
Solon. Spiritualism and Spiritualism. Both alike humbug.
Solomon. Not so. No •wilful humbug, probably, in the Lourdes
Spiritualism. The Spiritualism in London not all humbug prepense.
Healing fountain of course incapable of humbug. Healing Medium
probably very capable. But possibly an enthusiastic self-humbug
only. Believers in both fountain and medium alike healed, how-
ever, humbug notwithstanding— healed through faith, by the
action of mind working on body. Read DR. CARPENTER'S Mental
Physiology.
Solon. That's how you explain MONSIGNOR CAPEL'S miracles,
then?
Solomon. Oh dear, no! Goodness gracious forbid I should say
they may not perhaps be real miracles.
Solon. You don't mean to say you believe in modern miracles?
What do you mean by a miracle?
Solomon. A. fact, impossible in the nature of things, but still a
fact, and therefore of necessity a fact effected by supernatural
agency. Such a fact I believe to be a miracle—credo quia unpossibile
est. A natural impossibility—not a supernatural one.
Solon. Do you know of any such possible impossibility?
Solomon. No; but I have read of one—the cure of one MICHAEL
PELLICER, cited by a late Bishop of MONSIGNOR CAPEL'S cloth, as
having occurred at Saragossa in 1640.
Solon. As how?
Solomon. MICHAEL PELLICEH lost a leg by amputation. He prayed
for a new leg, and got one—an actual, bona tide, new live leg,
according to the renowned BISHOP MILKER.
Solon. Stupendous, if true.
Solomon.'A miracle is a miracle. All miracles are equally stu-
pendous. No one miracle is more wonderful than another. All,
equally impossible, are equally possible. Perhaps MONSIONOB CAPEL
can pattern the cure of MICHAEL PELLICEK. He will do so to the
satisfaction of all reasonable beings by producing from Lourdes, La
Salette, Loretto, or anywhere else, so much as even the restoration
of the last joint of a little finger. If any Monsignor, or other philo-
sopher, is really prepared to quote such a case of the miraculous,
perhaps he will be so kind as to forward it to 85, Fleet Street.
Solon. Where it will eclipse even all the marvels of art and
literature in the shop-window, and to be had, a whole number of
them, at the small charge of threepence over the counter.
PARISIAN INTELLIGENCE.
LADIES, pray give your attention for a moment to the folio wing:—
"The Titus mode of dressing the hair in short curia, adopted by several of
the leaders of Paris fashion, marks the commencement of a reaction which
will probably be complete ere long. Intelligent ladies now incline to return
to the use of natural hair; and this determination has been induced by con-
siderations of health which have an unquestionable value."
Here, indeed, is intelligence, in either meaning of the word. That
Ladies should resolve to wear their own Hair only—that which really
is their own by nature, not by purchase—may clearly be accepted
as a proof of their intelligence, and, moreover, is a startling and a
pleasant piece of news. In far too many cases the Hair which they
display is in relatively inverse proportion to their brains. Ladies
who are gifted with but little in their heads are generally conspicu-
ous for what is worn upon them. They bestow more cultivation on
the outside than the inside, and bonnets are esteemed of more
account than brains.
Since False Hair has been discarded for sanitary reasons, perhaps
we may soon hear that other fashionable errors have been sensibly
corrected for the same sufficient cause. There can be little question
that, if Ladies of intelligence were allowed to set the fashion, many
changes would be made in feminine costume. The wearing of low
dresses would be speedily abolished, and girls might go to balls and
theatres without fear of a sore throat. No longer Ladies would be
lamed by the torture of high heels, nor would they catch their
deaths from damp by wearing shoes with wafer soles. A wasp
waist would be viewed not as a beauty but a horrible deformity,
and tight-lacing be discarded as a certain, cause of suffering, ill-
temper, and ill-health.

From Rathdrum.—In the early morning. Beautiful. We meet eight
miners, dressed in their Sunday best apparently, walking about ten yards in
front of three stalwart police officers. All laughing and talking, and taking it
very leisurely. Two of the police engaged on nuts. These officers, I see, have
no side-arms, only thick walking-sticks.
"It's a summons for foightm," my Driver explains. "They'11 be foined
elevin and sixpence, and spend double in goin' back in cars."
I express my astonishment at their being so well dressed.
"Ah," says my Carman, ".they're daycent boys, but they get foightin on
pay-day, and then the P6-lTs is down on them. Shure, they march to Mass on
Sundays with a band playin', and they crowd the Chapel of the Seven Churches
so that for last prayers ye can't move at a snail's pace along the road."
He points put to me the Broekagh Chapel,—and, leaving the car below, I
mount the hill and enter it. It is a fine sized building, open all day, as are
most of the "Chapels," (they call all the Catholic Churches "Chapels,"—a
traditional custom, I suppose, derived from the times of the Protestant ascen-
dency,) fitted up with only a very few benches.
"From seven to eight hundred miners," my Carman informs me, "hear Mass
here every Sunday, without reckoning farmers; and there 'II be more outside
than inside."
Looking upon this description as perhaps intended for a cynical double
entendre, which I can take just whichever way my bias inclines me, I put the
question to him straight:
"When you say ' there are more outside than inside,' do you mean that the
people who don't go to mass are more than those who do?"
He is scandalised at such a turn being given to his words.
"Ah begorr no !" he cries, "that's not the way of it
at all at all. The Chapel's as full as it can hold, and
there's as many more again outside, so that ye see, Sorr,
'tis full inside and out."
Is this the case at home in our mining 'districts?
Do all our miners in a body turn out for a Church
parade'! If they do, they must be much belied.
Note by the way. What I had been led to Expect to
See I have not Seen.—I have not seen a drunken Irish-
in; nor a fight of any description; not even a row. I
hare seen, as aboyementioned, eight men taken up for
having been previously drunk and disorderly. I believe
this also happens, occasionally, in England; and, per-
haps, such a case is not absolutely unknown in our
mining districts.
I have not seen anybody with the traditional long coat
and cape, brandishing a shillelagh. Sorry that ancient
customs should be dying out. Perhaps all the old stock
has been sold to the theatres.
I have not seen a " Wake." Somebody offered to take
me to one; but having been informed that "sham
wakes" are got up for the benefit of a stranger (and of
course for the special benefit of the performers in it), I
decline with thanks.
My driver, however, makes me a genuine offer for a
genuine wake. "A dacent body," he says, is the widow
at whose house the wake is to take place, where it
appears there will be "lashinsto drink all round." I
can come, if I am so minded.
"But surely," I object, "on such an occasion, a
stranger, a visitor, would not be welcome. And besides,"
I add, "I thought that only the family and the most
intimate friends could be present at what, after all, is a
part of the funeral."
"Ah, begorr, that's a fact, then," replied my friend;
"but sure, Sorr, I 'd take you meself, and ye d go as a
relation of the corpte."
1 Happy Thought, for being present at a Wake.—Go as
a relation of the Corpse! If it were not for the hurry
I 'm in, and PLTTMPTON AND SPBT in the distance, I should
like to appear in this new character.
Further on the road we meet, coming into Rathdrum
for the market, a party which I should like to sketch,
but can't. There are four good-looking, brawny peas-
ants, marching solemnly, two in front and two in the
rear, and exactly in the middle is trotting theprettiest,
whitest, perkiest, merriest little Lambkin I've ever
seen. The Lambkin is clearly enjoying the grandeur
of the ceremony. Regardless of his doom, the little
victim trots. I could, almost swear to the Lambkin's
having winked at me in passing. 0 Butcher, spare that
Lamb! May the garden never thrive that grows the
mint that flavours the sauce to be served with that
tender Lambkin!
Are the four strong, silent men overcome with grief,
and struggling with emotion? Must they sell that Lamb
to pay the rint? And oh, doesn't Bint rhyme with
Mint! And is that little Lamb a mint in himself to
those four big men, that band of brothers, tenants of one
common cabin, marching in to Rathdrum Market with
that pretty baby sheep decked for the sacrifice?
Heavens! I thought that in Ireland it was the Pig that
paid the rint? Where is the Pig, Gentlemen? Send for
the Pig, if you please. Perish a dozen Pigs sooner than
this angelic-faced, simple-minded Lambkin!
Stay! If / buy it, here, on the spot,—what shall I do
with it? Suppose I offer to pay the rint myself. Pay
the rint and spare the Lamb. What guarantee shall I
have that the Lamb will be spared? They may sell him
when I am gone. Or if I purchase him and take him up
with me in the car, shall I not be compelled to leave him
at the next Hotel? And will the Proprietor, or the
Cook, be able to withstand the terrible temptation?
Supposing 1 make them swear they won't hurt a hair of
his head—I mean a lock of its wool—what can I say if, a
fortnight hence, I receive this note:—
"HONOURED Sra,
"Ws regret to inform you that the dear little

FEMALE DRESS REVOLUTION.

PHILADELPHIA, has been considerably enlivened by an
interesting revival. The American Free Dress League,
by recent accounts, has been sitting m the Quaker Uty.
The Dress Reform, however, contemplated by this
Association has no tendency to the style of the bociety
of Friends. It is to be a resuscitated Bloomerism. Une
of a string of resolutions read before the Dress Reformers,
by MRS. MAKY E. TILLOTTSON, of Vmeland, New Jersey,
indicates the improved costume proposed for women as
follows:—
"Resolved that such garmenture shall be of the dual form,
for the legs as well as the arms, aa their use and all reason
indicate; that the prejudice against trousers for women la
founded on ignorance and tyranny, is fostered by many vicious
and sordid motives, and ought to be banished from the earth by
the full sanction and fearless effort of all people.
The Ladies who denounce the tyranny of Fashion and
of Man in these strong expressions seem not to nave
considered that their violent language on the subject ot
female dress is really subversive of all petticoat govern-
ment. Perhaps the motives which foster the prejudice
against trousers for women may be vicious; but m what
respect can they be said to be sordid? Possibly, inas-
much as one of the Dress Reformers lamented that she
could not afford the garmenture of the dual form for the
legs as well as the arms, because stingy men object to it
as too expensive. If Ladies' milliners' bills wiU be
exceeded by those of their tailors, the expense ot the
garmenture with the crural dualities will be great
indeed. Dress Reform and retrenchment will by no
means go together, and Ladies will be utterly unable to
dress like Gentlemen on £15 a year. Until, therefore,
the tenderer sex can manage to achieve their pecuniary
independence of the tougher, the practicability ot Dress
Reform in the dual direction -will become a question tor
the pocket of that garmenture at present remaining
exclusively masculine. Woman, m fact, must work out
her own emancipation, if she wishes, as some ot her
sisterhood in America at least, if not elsewhere, avowedly
do, to wear the knickerbockers.

the opening Address in the Economic Science and Statistical Depart-
ment was delivered by SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL, who appears to have
"discussed a variety of topics, from Thriftmess to Women s Rights,
and, " in regard to the Women's question," to have suggested a
scientific inquiry into their capacities." But which of their capaci-
ties SIR GEORGE? Their capacity for admiration, or their capacity
for amusement, or their capacity for spending money, or their
capacity for varied and costly attire, or their capacity for gossip, o
their capacitv for flirtation and fascination? Oh no!

DEAB MR. MAYOR,
I CANNOT attend your Meeting, but only hope that the in-

discuss this momentous question. It must be done quite impartially
and dispassionately, of course ; [though History tells us that less
serious matters have roused in the hearts of Britons a righteous
indignation that has hurled Ministers from their places. Let it be
by all means borne in mind that it is not yet proved conclusii-ely that
the Ministry connived at or instigated these outrages. Please read
this letter to my fellow-townsmen, and beg them to dismiss all
Party feeling (however difficult it may be) from their breasts.
Yours ever,

MY LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, the Visita-
tion Charge .lately delivered by your Grace in your
cathedral to your Clergy, contains some advice, espe-
cially on the conduct of argument with gainsayers, to
the general character of which it may be feared that our
philosophical friends will, most ot them, discern an
exception in the words below quoted. Having, soundly
enough, insisted on the existence of the Bible and the
Church at large as unquestionable facts, your Grace
proceeded as follows:—
"What two facts on which philosophers pride themselves are
to be compared in their practical significance with these two? Is
it, indeed, departing from the spirit of modern philosophy to take
advantage of the position which excludes those two great facts?
What, compared with these, are any observed traces of primajval
man in some distant cave, which no one has thoroughly investi-
gated? What, compared with these, oro the traces of the feet
of extinct animals impressed upon mud here or there?"
What, indeed, your Grace? Certainly, nothing what-
ever. But then, on the other hand, please consider what
are these questions to the point'( Are the facts of
geology which Clergymen have to grapple with, and
that not merely for the confutation 01 cavil, but in order
to answer honest and irrepressible question, really repre-
sented, the whole of them, by a few superficially observed
traces of primtcval man in some distant cave, and by the
traces of the feet of extinct animals impressed here and
there on the mud? Can this be your Grace's way of
piitting the tremendous geological difficulties wherewith
Divines are called upon to deal r1 They might well
enough have been put so by an Archbishop of another
cloth than yours, if perchance he had brought himself to
open his mouth touching problems on whose solution In-
fallibility itself is mute. Another time, then, perhaps
you will not in a moment of forgetfulness allow yourself
to fall into the style of the common emotional un-
scientific preacher who does not hesitate at affecting to
reduce mountains to molehills in the face of fact; and
to the reverse of edification. For we all know that cant
is alien to the nature of his present Grace of Canterbury.

A CAUTIOK TO CHERTSEY.
THE Justices of the Chertsey Petty Sessional Division have shown
that they know how to stamp out hydrophobia. They mean to do
this by putting their foot down directly on the parties responsible
for the propagation of that frightful infection. In a notice oearing
the signature of " TIKIS. M. JENKINS, Clerk to the Justices of the
said Division," issued from the Town Hall, Chertsey, setting forth
"that various Dogs within the Parish of Chertsey have been bitten
by a certain Dog known to have been MAD," and that " it is most
desirable for the general safety that the powers conferred on the
said Justices," by a specified Act of Parliament, "with regard to
dangerous and Mad Dogs should be put in force," the owners of all
Dogs are given the fair but formidable warning which follows:—
"Now IT is HEREBY ORDERED that all Persons having the ownership or
possession of any Dog known to hare been bitten by any other Dog within
three months preceding the date hereof, shall forthwith be destroyed, or placed
under proper and effective control for the space of six months next ensuing."
Instead, then, of restricting their action for the arrest of hydro-
phobia to the canine species, the Chertsey Justices are determined
to extend it to the Dogs' masters and mistresses. The least that
any of all those heedless Persons guilty of keeping Dogs known to
have been bitten by any other Dog within the last three months can
expect is a seclusion of double that period; during which they will
be closely shut up. But worse than that, they will be liable, the whole
of them, to be destroyed,—snmmarily hanged, shot, drowned, or
poisoned,—at the Justices' bidding: and let them not make too sure
that those resolute Magistrates will be content with merely ordering
them to be confined, and will not, as the safest course to pursue with
such dangerous people, consign every one of them to destruction.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN
Visits Drury Lane, the Haymarket, and the Gaiety, and reports
thereon.
SIR,
NOT to have seen ME. BAERY SULLIVAN in some Shakspearian
part, argues Your Representative unknown. Up to last night, Sir,
I had not seen that eminent Tragedian in anything, except—yes—
once—in a hansom cab, when he appeared amiable, and probably
overpaid the driver. It was a brief but beautiful vision, and one
that nas dwelt in my memory for many a long day. I have seen
BARRY SULLIVAN. I was told that at that very moment he was
driving to some station, en route for America. Perhaps my only
chance of seeing him in a Shakspearian character had been (as it
struck me the moment afterwards) then and there offered me, and I
refused it! Perhaps I might never have such an opportunity again.
Should I rush after the cab, stop it, represent the emergency of the
case to the eminent Tragedian, and request him to step out and give me
a Scene from Richard, and another from Macbeth, on the pavement?
I would dispense with the dress, and be 'satisfied with a wig only, as
I am certain it must have been his wig-box which was perched on
the top of the cab. But the inspiration passed, my courage failed
me, BARRY SULLIVAN went to America, and I went to dinner. Years
have passed since then, and at last I have seen BAERY SULLIVAN in
Richard the Third. Well, you will ask me how do I feel after it? Sir.
I was delighted,—emphatically I say I was delighted. It is a bold
thing to commit oneself to a " universal," but I do not believe that
there is on the English stage, at the present day, any Actor who,—
admitting the truth of MR. BARRY SULLIVAN'S conception of the
character.—can touch him in hia impersonation of GIBBER'S Richard
the Third. Never strained, never ranted, it is, throughout, a con-
sistent performance. MR. BEVERLEY'S scenery is charming, in spite
of the low sky-borders, and occasional careless setting. The stage
management of the masses is better than usual. Altogether, in your
Representative's humble judgment, nothing; in London is more worthy
the attention of those who profess to be interested in the highest
form of the Drama, than Drury Lane during the reign of GIBBER and
SULLIVAN'S Crook-back'd Tyrant.
Now for the Haymarket and Domestic Drama.
Dan'l Druce, considered as an adaptation of GEORGE EUOT'S most
touching homely story, Silas Marner, is, to my mind, simply Silas
Marner muddled and spoilt. Had the novel never existed, Dan'l
Druce would still have been a disappointing drama, weak where it
should have been strong, and hazy where it should have been as clear
as the sun at noonday. Far be it from me to deny the dramatist's
right to take the materials for his work wherever he may find them.
He has high authority for so doing. And, where the novel and its
novelist are so familiar to us all as Silas Marner and GEORGE ELIOT,
it is no less graceful than ingenuous on the part of the dramatist to
bow his acknowledgments, from the playbill, to the creative genius
that furnished him with the raison d'etre of his play. All this,
which the dramatist has done in the present case, is as it should
be, but there is also much that is as it shouldn't be.
The name of Silas Marner has been turned into Jonas Marple,
which is about the ingenious' process which Your Representative
would employ were he to, somehow, reproduce Pickwick,—with an.
acknowledgment, of course, to the late MR. CHARLES DICKENS,—
when he would certainly change Samuel Welter into Lemuel Smel-
ler, as an indication of Your Representative's anxiety to be as original
as possible,—under the circumstances. I had been informed by
some amiable enthusiast that the Love Scene in the Second Act was
"idyllic." Well,—this love scene is between a Sailor fresh from
sea, and a Blacksmith's daughter of seventeen,—that is, between a
young rover, who has been round the world and knows a thing or
two (as he subsequently proves), and a demure rustic coquette, an
apparently strait-laced slyboots. Now, if by "idyllic" _my
amiable enthusiast meant unreal,"

don't expect
the old story of the Artist who complained to the Critic that the latter
had called his skies "putty." *' But," retorted the Critic, "my
dear fellow, I like putty, idoat on putty."
There is, however, one Scene in which unqualified praise is due
to the Dramatist primarily, and in the next place to the Actors, and
this is where Sir Jasper (MR. HOWE) is recognised by Jonas (MR.
VEZIN) as the father of Dorothy (Miss MARION TERRY), and is
allowed to kiss her. From first to last this Scene is admirably con-
ceived, forcibly written, and, it is pleasant to add, so perfectly
played as to leave nothing to be desired.
A more charming representative of Dorothy Druce could not be
found on any stage than Miss MARION TERHY, whose refinement,
modesty, and grace carry with her, throughout, the sympathies of the
audience, and win for her, at the end, a well-deserved and most
heartily bestowed tribute'of praise.
The part of the Sergeant, intended to represent the comic element
of the piece, reminded me at times of the kind of drolleries one used
to expect from the Wag who was styled in a Circus the " Shak-
spearian Clown," with just a dash, here and there, of "ancient

Pistol." It was evidently written for MB. COMPTON, and not for
MJJ. ODELL, as the part or Dan'l struck me as having been meanl
for Ma. EMEBY, and not for MB. VEZIN. And indeed, in the Second
Act, when Jonas Marple, alias Dan'l Druce (or vice versa),
addresses Dorothy as "My pretty," I could easily imagine old
"Dan'l" Peggotty. and not " Dan'l" Druce, on the scene, speaking
to Em'ly in precisely the same words. At the same time MB. HER-
MANN VEZIN is to be heartily congratulated on a most thoroughly
artistic performance, which, without once overstepping the bounds
of moderation, deeply impresses the audience with a conviction of
the Artist's truth or conception and earnestness of purpose.
For my part, taking the cast of the piece at the Haymarket all
round,—MB. HOWE'S is also a performance of sterling value to the
drama.—I feel convinced that they do not "manage these things
letter in France." MB. GIIBEBT has done some good work in Dan'l
Druce, and the best in it is that scene which I have already men-
tioned, and which Author, Actors, and a critical Audience, may
regard with unalloyed satisfaction.
From grave to gay, from the Haymarket to the Gaiety. Your
Representative has not often seen, since the golden days of the
Strand—the days, I mean, of MABLE WILTON, FANNY JOSEPHS
CHARLOTTE SATTNDEBS, JAMES ROGBBS, JOHN CLABKE and BLAND,—
such a cast for a burlesque as MB. BYBON has had the good
fortune to obtain for his Little Don C&sar de Bazan. which, how-
ever, can stand on its own merits among the best of such pieces.
To those to whom the fortunes of burlesque are interesting I can
only put the question, isn't Miss NELLIE FABBEN the life and soul of
any piece of this sort? isn't TEBBY inimitably grotesque? isn't
Miss KATE VATTQHAN grace itself, and fun too, mind you? and isn't
MB. ROYCE as good at eccentric makes-up, also at dancing, singing,
and even tumbling, as any professor of such arts within your ex-
perience? Certainly. Miss WEST, too. makes a bright Lazarillo,

Salary £20, and laundress.
It would seem that preparation for the filling of the body is
esteemed of higher value than for tilling of the mind. A Cook now
rains the income that a Clergyman has earned, and we find her
'passing rich on forty pounds a year." But a Governess is wanted
to serve for half the money, and is frequently expected to do more
;han twice tho work. To aid her in her labour, a Cook requires a
Kitchenmaid, and Scullerymaid as well: whereas a Governess is
sxpected to give lessons all day long, with nobody to help her, and
n the evening to amuse herself by darning frocks and mending
pinafores, insomuch that, while a Governess by name, she discharges
n reality the duties of a nurse. The comparative proportions of
books' and Governesses' wages signify that some children are better

K.C.B. (usually a very well-behaved little man), pursed up. his shrivelled and tiny
lips, and pretended not to see his kind instructor. Mr. Punch saw 'at once that his
pupils were ripe for mutiny. He acted with decision.
'My friends," said he, severely, "if you are Officers, I must ask you to behave like
Gentlemen."
"Sir," cried COLONEL CHARLES, of the Royal East Mudborough Militia, " you have
grossly insulted us."
"How?" was the very natural question put to the angry Militiaman by Mr, Punch.

"You have expressed your intention of explaining the duty a British Officer owes

leld-Marshal knows something about it—don't you, SIB FRANKY, dear?"

of the Grenadiers Green?" asked Mr. Punch.
"Everybody knows that a man should leave his men as much as possible in the
hands of his Non-Commissioned Officers," was the haughty reply of the Guardsman.
"And you, ENSIGN EUGENE, of the Volunteers?" said M r. Punch, smiling. "In
what do you think the duty of an Officer to his men consists?"
"Oh, I learnt that much within a week of joining my Corps," replied the Rifle-
man, contemptuously. "The duty of an Officer is to pay a heavy annual subscription,
to give prizes, and to provide an unlimited amount of beer and bread and cheese for
the men of his company."
"I am glad to find, Officers and Gentlemen," said Mr. Punch, "that you know
more than I gave you credit for. Still, with your permission. I think I may give you
a few useful hints." And with this the Sage commenced his Lecture :—
Part II. Particular.—According to MAJOB-GENEBAL SIR GARNET WOLSELEY (see
his Pocket Hook, page 4), the Soldier " is a peculiar animal." The same high authority
insists that this stranpe creature can only be brought to a proper state of efficiency
by being taught;to take a pride (1) in his dress and (2) in himself. "He must
believe that his duties are the noblest that fall to man's lot. He must be taught to
despise all those of civil life." That SIR GARNET believes these doctrines to be of the
utmost importance may be gathered from the following extract from the Soldiers'
1 ocket Brmlt (page 9); in which the kit of an Infantry Officer is given, "One cup (in
leather bag), containing knife, fork, spoon, pepper and salt pots (1 Ib.): one india-
rubber basin (1 Ib.); some tobacco, and the Soldiers' Pocket Book (1 Ib.)."
Probably with a view to teaching his men "to
despise the duties of civil life," SIR GABNET, dur-
ing a recent campaign, treated newspaper corre-
spondents with military politeness. As the worthy
Major-General asserts that "whatever the Officers
think fine, the Men will think so too," he doubtless
must regret that the fashion of book-writing has
not been taken up by the rank and file, and that
consequently "the Soldier's Pocket-Book (i Ib.)"
has as yet but few important rivals.
Perhaps fortunately for the men, the Queen's
Regulations do not altogether order the Officer
to consider the Soldier a " peculiar animal." On
the contrary, there are occasions when a Colonel
may even argue with his men. For instance, to
quote sect. 7. par. 142, "Commanding Officers of
Regiments who have ample experience of the_very
great inconvenience arising from the improvident
marriages of Soldiers, are to discountenance such
marriages, and to explain to the men that the in-
convenience and distress naturally accruing there-
from are serious and unavoidable." Of course,
unmarried Colonels, who have not had "ample
experience," should depute the duty to the next
Senior Married Officer. The speech of the Officer
to the Man should be fashioned on the following
model:—" PRIVATE SMITH, I learn from the Cap-
tain of your company (himself a married man, who
made his report to me with tears of compassion
streaming down bis cheeks) that you wish to join
us! My good man, have you considered the incon-
venience and'distress accruing from such a step;'
Look at me. You see me in a patrol jacket covered
with braid, and at a Leveo I am a mass of gold
and spurs; and yet I tell you, PRIVATE JOHN
SMITH, I would willingly give up my commission
to obtain your good-conduct stripes, coupled with
your state of single blessedness. As a married
man, I cannot call my life my own. I am allowed
only a couple of glasses of wine when I get away
to dine at Mess; I must be in quarters at ten;
and when I am off duty I have to take charge of
the children! All this is done by the order of my
wife. Beware, PRIVATE JOHN SMITH, of matri-
mony! I would say much, much more did I not
hear the voice of my wife. She calls me (in a
disgracefully peremptory tone of voice), and I
must obey! Farewell!" And with this telling
line the Colonel (or next Senior Married Officer) can
make his exit.
Again, the Queen's Regulations (sect. 15, par.
95) assert that Libraries and Recreation Rooms
have been established to " encourage Soldiers to
employ their leisure hours in a manner that shall
combine amusement with the attainment of useful
knowledge, and to teach them the value of sober,

regular, nml moral habits." Tluis if the Officers do
their duty to their Men, SIR GARNET WOLSELEY'S
"peculiar animal" may some day hope to reach

Mr. Punch. Certainly, my dear ENSIGN ETOENE, of the Volunteers

to marry his daughters to eligible elder sons, and to snub the Civi

ior our training I follow that gallant Officer's advice. I do not
encourage the presence of the Press at our inspection, and yet the

Tire greatest of all the recent wonders of Spiritualism is the
amazing communication narrated by a Correspondent of the Times
as follows:—
"A Mend of mine who has just returned from America tells me that lie, a
short time since, attended a stance, at which the Medium obtained messages
from several celebrities of both ancient and modern timei, and, among others
one (at the request of my friend) from Bucephalus, who condescended to
inform the company that he still took great interest in literary pursuits,
particularly in connection with education."
Spoken like the spirit of a noble animal. In general the messages
received through Mediums from defunct celebrities, whether modern
jr ancient, seem to have come from Donkeys—and to be addressed
to their kind.
A D/EDALUS AT DOVER.
ALPH STOTT, a
Gentleman of
Dover, has in-
vented a new Fly-
ing Machine. A
morning contem-
porary says that
MR. STOTT has
gone to Berlin, for
the purpose of
having an inter-
view with PRINCE
BISMARCK, who is
understood to
have requested
him to furnish
particulars with
the object of
ascertaining how
the machine can
be utilised in war-
fare. If, as is
stated, MR. STOTT
can by means of
it "propel him-
self through the
air at the rate
of a uiilo per mi-
nute, or up to the speed of one hundred miles an hour," and, by
means of a break-power, applied by a wheel, "can make the
machine stationary in mid air, or fiy at any speed which the
occupant of the car can bear," no doubt he is exceedingly well
prepared to assure the German Government" that his Flying
Machine would "be invaluable for purposes of war." For the
purpose of ascertaining' an enemy's position its convenience may be
imagined; but, besides, it may be capable of being employed in
actual warfare. By-and-by, perhaps, armies will come to be pro-
vided with real flying squadrons, and troops will actually fight in
the clouds. Musketry will be carried to'a height of perfection even
greater than it has now attained; riflemen will have to be able to
shoot flying, and bring down their man on the wing. The introduc-
tion of the Flying Machine among warlike engines, and its applica-
tion to military purposes, will of course constitute a fearfully costly
addition to armaments already bloated; but the cheap defence of
nations is now no longer possible, and Governments, in their martial
preparations, are obliged to be regardless of expense. However, the
Flying Machine, it appears, has yet to be tried. PRINCE BISMABCK
will probably suspend his judgment about it until its inventor shall
have flown over the Channel, in which, let us hope, that our British
Dsedalus may not come, like Icarus rather, to such grief as will
assimilate it in sad celebrity, to the JEgean Sea.

BOYS IN BAD COMPANY.
OUGHT not Prisons to be also as much as possible Reformatories?
Then, what a mistake is made in rendering them just the reverse;
is, for instance, in the case referred to the other day at Lincoln by
tfa. PLIMSOLL, in replying to a complimentary address from some
Working Men. A customary sight there until lately was, he said,
;hat of lads, sentenced for various terms of imprisonment at
Jrimsby. marching, manacled together, from the railway station to
the Lindsay Prison." An edifying spectacle on the face of it to
street Arabs and other iuvenile offenders! But these youths were
not .pickpockets, that they should have been handcuffed, as they
were; though this is now so no longer:—
"The manacling was now abolished; but the boys were etill sent to gaol
or breach, of contract, and he had that morning seen, clad in prison dress, in
the same prison as the worst of criminals, boys whose fine open countenances
assured him that they had no right to be there—boys to whom he should not
lesitate a moment to hand a sovereign for change. It was a shame and a
lisgrace that such boys were to be found in a prison for merely breaking a
>argain, and he hoped, and felt assured, some other punishment would soon
ie found for such oflenders."
Is it desirable that evil communications from rogues and thieves
hould corrupt the good manners of boys innocent of anything much
worse than playing truant, but compelled to associate with common
criminals? Imprisonment may serve them right, and so may hard
abour, but could they not at least be confined apart from the
onvicts, allowed to wear their own clothing, and have a treadmill
all to themselves? In all that a certain Personage is said to look
over in Lincoln the sight of those boys and those blackguards in
companionship must be as pleasing to him as anything.

The Seven Churches.—Five times already in the course of my
drive have I picked out the most beautiful spot where I should like
to stop. It was the same yesterday, about Bray; but—let bygones
be bygones, and give me—at the present moment, that is while I
am here, on the spot—for a residence, the little Hotel of Glendalough,
in the Vale of the Seven Churches. Let me stop here for six weeks
in the summer time.
Of course I have a polite and intelligent Guide—they are all polite
and generally intelligent, these Irish Guides—and we cross the
upper lake in order to visit St. Kevin's Bed. We have two Boatmen.
I confess to being still impressed by resemblances. The bow-oar
in our boat is ME. FALCOITBH as Danny Mann in the Colleen Sawn,
and my light-hearted Guide would be, if he only had on a tattered
hunting-suit and cap, the very counterpart of "poor Joe," in Jack
Hinton. The likenesses only hold good for a moment, at first
sight: directly they speak, the illusion is dispelled.
It is a " Gloomy Lake," this Glendalough. Yet not so utterly
gloomy but that it reminds me of a plaintive Irish melody. It is a
composition of Nature's in a sad, soft minor key. On me it has a
mesmeric effect. I am in Charon's ferry-boat. I left life on the
other side. The boat is brought up with a jerk against the rocks.
I am awoke from my trance. We land.
_" This way, Sorr!" cries my Guide, as he assists me on to the
slippery rocks below St. Kevin's Bed. "Hould on, Sorr! More
pow r to your elbow!"
It occurs to me for the first time to-day that I 've come out in
tight boots: and, what adds to the difficulty is, that the soles are
thin and as smooth as a razor-strap.
I arrive at the above conclusion after having very nearly stumbled
on to my nose, and only recovering myself by having "more power
to my elbow" afforded by the Guide.
"This way up, Sorr!" shouts the Guide, already some feet above
me.
I pause. I am hesitating. The Guide is making for St. Kevin's
Bed. Query, is St. Kevin's Bed worth making? Can't I read the
description, and say I 've been there P Is any place at a great
height above the sea level, worth the trouble of a climb? For
such an excursion, too, ought not one to have come prepared with
an alpenstock, with stout, stiffly-bound- hob-nailed boots, thick
stockings, and. so on? In fact, ought I not to be more in the
costume of a gentleman ready to stand in the front line for the
opening, chorus o_f an opera, with a rifle in one hand and a cup in
the other, and with "Ho! la! hi! ho!" or sporting words to that
effect, issuing from my open lips P
Yes—in that dress I might essay the rugged height, hut, empha-
tically, "not in these boots," as I believe some song says.
[Psychological Query d propos de Bottes.—Ii the song does not
say so, or if there is no song which does say so, whence did the
words occur to me, quite rhythmically, " not in these boots "? Note
this, and consider it.~\
The Boatmen are seated below, and lighting their pipes. The
Guide is waving me on to better things above. Excehior! Evidently
I am expected to go; and my attendants have calculated upon at
least a quarter of an hour being allowed for refreshment. It is,
clearly, the "regular thing to do.'
Another Note.—la this too the refrain of some popular song?
"The Regular Thing to Do "—if not, it ought to be. For example—
I don't go up the Rhine and back
Because 'tis something new;
I only go, "cos 'tis, you know,
"The regular thing to do.
Spoken—(there's always a "Spoken" with a Comic Singer).—
You see I put on a tourist suit, all ditto checks outside and lined
ditto within—in the pockets, I mean,—and I tell the people I am
going up the Rhine—yaas—and to the banks of the Blue Moselle. I
shall change my checks at the first bank of the Blue Moselle—and I
shall be awfully bored, you know, and very hot and very tired, and
have to pay through the nose—but what of that? Every one will
be there—and one can't be out of the fashion—oh demme—no—so
you 'd better, all of you, join me,—(Here the Comic Singer will put
on his hat sideways, jerk his head knowingly, wink his eye at, it is
supposed, the female portion of his audience, whom he thereby
fascinates; and, sticking his left thumb in the armhoh of his waist-
coat, he Witt indicate with his right hand the direction he intends to
take} as he humorously finishes)—I'm ready,—and waiting,—and
willing, so you 've only got to
Come with me across the sea,
And foreign parts go through.
We only go cos 'tis we know
"The regular thing to do."
[The other day I saw, in some law case about disputed copyright,
that the value of one of those ditties ranged from £800 to £2000.
Evidently—
Happy Thought.—Write a Comic Song for £2000. There would
then be some meaning in the expression, "Oh, he got it for a mere
song."]
St. Kevin's Chair.—Facilis Aseensus—up to a certain point. In
St. Kevin's Chair I sit down. If this is all, there is no danger.
A voice, from somewhere round the corner, sings out, "Here's the
bed, Sorrl Ho-o-o!"
It is the nimble Guide who is round the corner. He is hanging
on, apparently, by nothing, and stepping on less; and all this with a
sheer descent below into the lake, and only a iutting point of rock,
here and there, to give your body an occasional lift on the way down.
"There's no danger, Sorr!" he cries, standing in a Mercury-
like attitude on a ledge one inch'in breadth, fifty feet above the
gloomy waters of Glendalough. "Come this way, Sorr!"
I look, very cautiously, over the rocky point, and crane my neck
round. I feel that if I make one step forward my next will be in
the air, and in another second or two. after a short whirligig through
a limited portion of space, there will be a dull plash in the water,
and then breathless excitement on the part of the Guide and Boat-
men (who would see their chance of remuneration disappear under
their very noses) until I should come to the surface, blowing like a
grampus, shaking my head like a dog bothered by a bee, and swim-
ming like CAPTAUr BOYTOIT.
The fall would be unpleasant, and then—the wet clothes! No;
no St. Kevin's Bed for me, I am obliged to you.

The Guide disappears once more into the hole, just to show me
how simple.it is when you know how to do it, and cries, "I 'm there,
Sorr!"
He shouts " Ho-o-o!" for the Echo, and the Echo, who happens
on this occasion to be a boatman on the other side, sings out in
"The top o' the mornin' t'you I"
The Guide, having thus conscientiously gone through what I
suppose to be his usual performance, rejoins me, and asks me, per-
suasively, "if I won't venture?"
"No, I won't," I reply, shortly and resolutely. I 've a mind to
tell him that he shall not be out of pocket by my not going. He
seems quite disheartened.
"Lots o' Ladies goes in there," he says, as if this would induce
me to risk it. I won't budge an inch.
"Well, Sorr," he returns, with consideration, "/ won't force
you."
The Guide, who seems dissatisfied with me for not having gone
into St. Kevin's Bed, and with himself for not having been able to
induce me; insists upon earning his money somehow, and so sets
to work, without being asked, to recite the whole of MooKE's_poem
about Glendalough, commencing "By that Lake whose gloomy
shore," &c. " '"
"And," he says, in conclusion, "no larks are ever heard singing
above the lake. So, Sorr, wasn't it moighty hard of St. Kayvin to
throw KATHLEEN into the water?"
. By the way, the Guide's pronunciation of "Kevin," i.e. "Kayvin,"
is another specimen of an Irish pun. St. Cave-in, who didn't, how-
ever, cave in" to Miss KATHLEEN MAVOUBNEEN.
Pace TOM MOOEE, I can suggest a new view of an old legend.
Here it is:—
THE OBIGIN OF NO LARKS ON OLENDALODGH.
BY that Lake whose gloomy shore
Skylark never warbles o'er,
Where the cliff hangs high and steep,
Young St. Kevin stole to sleep;
And before he laid his head
On hia chill and stony bed,
This was one of his remarks,
"I am all alone. No Larks!."
Twas from KATHLEEN'S eyes he flew,
(Not at all what I should do.
Jint young Kevin was a Saint;
Which I do admit I ain't).
Here, when ho was fast asleep,
KATIII.KKN climbed, and took a peep;
Woke the Saint, who, with one knock,
Hurled her from the beetling rock.
Glendalough, thy gloomy wave
Soon was gentle KATHLEEN'S grave.
She 'd have floated like a stalk
Had she been a Maid of Cork.
Nowhere could she rest her sole,
So she sank. And to his bole
Back the young St. Kevin harks,
Murm'ring to himself, "No Larks!"

"HOW TO DRESS OX FIFTEEN
POUNDS A YEAR."
By One who has Done It—Once.
GET all your clothes made at the best
tailor's. Be careful to order a sufficient
number of pairs of trousers, and once a
month (at least) have a new frock-coat. By
these means your bill will not be sent in to
you for eighteen months.
Pursue the same plan with your hats.
Whenever you pass your hatter, go in and
get a new chapeau.
Three pairs of boots a month should be
your standing order at the boot-maker's.
Keep half a dozen pairs on trees waiting
for you all the year round in his custody.
Get your linen from France. When the
collector makes his annual round, go to
Paris. You will find the trip less costly
than his bill, and the change of air should
do you good.
Always have a large supply of fancy
walking-sticks. Each suit should have its
own cane.
And, lastly, pay ready money (fifteen
pounds shoufd really be enough) for your
umbrellas. _
AN AMAZING CRAMMER.
THE Globe announces that :—
"An extraordinary case of suicide lias taken
place at Hayward's Heath. A railway porter,
while' in a state of delirium, ate nearly the whole
of a newspaper, and died from suffocation."
This is an extraordinary case of suicide
indeed, if the poor man suffocated by eating
a newspaper really ate it intending to kill
himself; but in his frenzy he probably took
it for something good to eat, and not for
anything bad. There are not many news-
papers coming under the head of poisonous
literature, though there is one, an illus-
trated weekly, circulating amongst the
lower orders, and familiarising them with
details and delineations of atrocity and
ruffianism. What paper could the delirious
porter have eaten? It is not likely that he
took in the Times for breakfast in any
sense, nor have we any reason to suppose
that he tried to cram himself with the
Daily Telegraph, being, as in a state of
delirium tremens, under the influence of
the D. T.
Don't fire, Colonel, I '11 come down." Unless I were on some very
convenient point for jumping into the water, when, being a fair
swimmer, I should prefer that for choice.
Were PLTTMPTON AND SPRY to send to capture me now, I should
not attempt to hide in St. Kevin's Bed.
I descend ungracefully, but safely.
I part with my boatmen. "How much ?" I ask.
"Well, Sony' says stroke-oar, "they do generally be givin'us
two shillings or half-a-crpwn, but we'd pre-fer half-a-croion."
Characteristic. He will not "do " me directly; but shifts the
responsibility on to my own shoulders. It's as much as to say,
"Well, with two shillings I'm well paid; but if you're such a
Saxon ass as to give me two-and-sixpence, on your own head be it;
only don't say I asked you."
Of course the result is half-a-crown; and I purchase an extra
blessing from the bow-oar for another sixpence.
"No Larks^' on Glendalough.
A delightful walk, and back again to the Royal Hotel, Glenda-
longh, where I am treated to as good a breakfast as I ever wish to
eat, served in as fresh and pleasant a room as ever I would wish to
sit in.
And oh delight! Oh joy! I am the first of the Mohicans! I
mean I am the first of the Tourists this year: not first in point of
prowess, but in point of time. The bed-rooms are not in order, the
sitting-rooms are hardly yet arranged-for sitting in, the Landlord is
a new one, and he tells me how he expects to make a fortune—may
he do BO, and I be none the worse for it, bless him! All I ask is to
be the last or the first of the Tourists. Let me enjoy this beautiful
scenery as ADAM enjoyed Paradise when he was en garcon. The
spirit of St. Kevin the Celibate is, as it were, upon me. Yes, I am
here, alone. "Come into the garden, MAUD, I am here by myself
alone "—only I don't want MAUD. If she were here, I should sing.
"Get out of the garden, MAUD, I 'd he here by myself alone"—and
be blowed to you!

long day's journey before me. May I, at the end of my journey,
have as charming a place to rest my weary limbs as is this!

A SAD MICHAELMAS.
ON Wednesday afternoon, September 27, 1876—the exact date
calls for precise record—at a meeting of the Court of Common
Council held at Guildhall, the LOKD MAYOR presiding, the City
Lands Committee brought up a report on the subject of the removal
of Temple Bar. Some discussion followed, which ended in a division,
whon the report of the Committee, recommending the removal of
the structure, was carried by 69 votes to -15, "and it was referred
back for execution."
After reading this harrowing scene, what man, what Liveryman,
in whose breast there is a spark of proper feeling, can foel surprised
at what follows?
The LORII MATOE continues to reside at the Mansion House, but
ho is living iu the strictest seclusion compatible with his official
duties. The latest bulletin is rather more favourable: it is to the
etfcct that his Lordship has passed a better night, and is a little
more composed. The blinds are all drawn down. The Footmen
wear crape on their left arm. Everywhere Liverymen may be seen
with some token of mourning. GOG and MAGOG are draped iu black
bombazine. Only mock turtle is served at dinner.
So great was the shock to the Lord Mayor Elect that he turned
White in a single night.
The Sherifis have never been separated since the meeting of the
Common Council. They felt—and many will sympathise with them
—that they could bear the blow better by being together, than if
they were left to themselves, each a prey to ilia own gloomy thoughts.
They see no one except their Chaplains and the Under-Sheriffs, who
are naturally much depressed.
The condition of several of the Aldermen, particularly amongst
those who have passed the Chair, is causing considerable anxiety to
their families and friends. They seem to have lost all interest in
what is going on around them, and pass most of their time in deep
thought. The only hopeful sign is that they are able to take
nourishment.
Several dinners and other entertainments which were to have been
given by the City Companies have been postponed.
The Chamberlain has already addressed nimself to the painful
task of composing a farewell oration, to be delivered on tne day
when the ruthless work of demolition commences.
It is a trying time for the Recorder, and a momentous one for the
Secondary.
It may be well imagined that the Remembrancer's remembrances
are sweet yet sad.
The fatal report haying been " referred back for execution," the
City Architect is nerving himself for the melancholy duty of super-
intending the preparation of the necessary scaffold.
The Mace-Bearer and the Sword-Bearer, like the Sheriffs, are
inseparable, and cannot bear to be out of each other's sight. They
find the greatest comfort in the sympathy and society of the City
Marshal. The Mace is enveloped in crape; the sheath of the Sword
has been painted black.
The Common Crier, faithful to his title, gives way to natural emo-
tion, both for himself and the entire Civic body.
The Water Bailiffs are plunged in grief, and the Bridge Masters
go about their duty on Bridges of Sighs.
Every morning groups of Deputies and Common Councilmen are
to be seen contemplating the Bar with feelings which may be
imagined but cannot be described. They can hardly tear them-
selves away from this " ancient landmark." this last great bulwark
of the Constitution and the Corporation; but they withdraw before
the traffic of the day begins, lest their emotion should be misinter-
preted by the heartless throng. Their only consolation is that the
North and South walls are not to be touched by the rude hand of the
spoiler.
The usual ceremonies and hospitalities of Michaelmas Day were
observed, that the charter might not be forfeited, but with a heavy
heart. There was a bitter drop in the Loving Cup. A deep gloom
seemed to have settled upon all who had to take part in the day's
proceedings, which they in vain strove to shake oft.
It will be a sad Lord Mayor's Day. If the dear old Bar is still
standing, it will be hung with black, and wreathed with cypress and
yew, but it is a question whether the feelings of the Procession will
allow them to pass under it. More probably, the mournful train
will hide their grief on the Embankment. The reception of the new
LORD MAYOR by the LORD CHIEF BARON at Westminster is expected
to be unusually touching. He has written the kindest letter of con-
dolence to the present occupant of the civic chair.
One of the most recently-elected Aldermen has been commissioned
to take a series of splendid photographs of the Bar from every point
of view and under every aspect, and at all hours of the day and
night.
At all the great civic Banquets a new toast in future will be given •" the Memory of Temple Bar!"

BEST AND NEXT BEST GOVERNMENT.
ACCORDING to a newspaper report, a discourse was delivered th
other Sundav at the Kensington Pro-Cathedral by CARDINAL MAN
spoon "The Progress of Christendom." By the account of Hi
Eminence Christendom appears to be making immense progress, in
the ironical sense of that word. The progress of ChristendoS is th
£n^ff 1 « -ta ?• S£chjhowever, it has been for a considerabl
and indefinite time. The Cardinal said that—
;r,'t^U Ty countries,Christendom was disintegrated and dismembered, and
m them there was no longer that Catholic unity which kept the Christian
™ ft* °H Eur°P<> together, because Kings and Princes had chosen to serve the
world and themselves rather than Catholic unity."
i, your Eminence? At what date, and for how long,

ft'v?Wh Chrl8$la? Peoples of Europe, kept together by Catholic
—ity? When, and during what while, dif they choose to serve
Catholic unity rather than themselves an'd the world, and to nH

enforced by the Rome of Catholic unity? Perhaps your Eminence

n°^ 1?ww' once existed- There it existed at
Clm8tendom was kept together, innocent of war
peace by Catholic unity. It continued to exist
there, with temporary interruptions, from that time, whenever that
time was, until a few years ago, till, finally, the year 1870. It was
genuinely strong absolutely, not merely so comparatively, in moral
right and power. Its moral right was that of Infallibility, and its
moral power was the basis of its Temporal Power. Strong in moral
power, it did not require for its maintenance to be surrounded by
armed men; as indeed we all know that it never was, particularly
not by French troops, during the interval between the overthrow of
the Roman Republic and the establishment of the Italian Monarchy
Nobody can need to be told that the seat of that Government,
which CARDINAL MANNING alleges to have been the model Govern-
ment of Christendom, was Papal Rome, whilst Rome remained the
city of the Sovereign Pontiff, and before it relapsed into the Capital
of Italy. But now Rome, as the Rome of Pontifical and Model
Government, is Rome no more. In the meantime the next best
thing to that Government altogether and entirely strong in moral
right and moral power—the best substitute, as times go, for the
Jovernment of Catholic Unity—is the Constitutional Government of
;he United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The best
Government on Earth that ever was, of course, was the Papal; but
;he second-best is the British. If CARDINAL MANNING is a Papalino
irst, he is an Englishman afterwards.

I dim Glendalough with regret. One hour ago I was in such
ecstasies with the place that, even had PLTJMPTON AND SPRY tele-
graphed to me " Come !" I should have wired back " P. AND 8. be
blessed! I don't stir from here for weeks."
This is my constant experience in this country. A lovely place
on Tuesday is followed by a lovelier on Wednesday, and by a still
more beautiful one on Thursday. So you go on, exceeding super-
latives. We drive away over the mountain, and down the other side
at full trot. "The English people," says my man, "don't see the
best part of the country, for the Carmen won't take them this
a-way: 'tis too heavy a road."
So it appears I am in luck; though which is the best part of the
eountry where all is so striking, it would be difficult to say. How-
ever, I put this down to my driver's politeness, and his desire to
give me the greatest gratification in the shortest possible time.
Now my Carman falls to quoting "TOMMY MOOBE," as he calls
him, and informs me that we are in the Vale of Avoca.
In the Vale of AKOC.O. at the Meeting of the Waters.—A jolt, a
snap, a crack, and the car comes down, or, rather, one side of the car
conies down, with a bump. The springs have "given " somewhere.
Happy Thought.—We mark our arrival at the " Meeting of the
Waters by the " separation of the springs."
Luckily, there is a blacksmith's near at hand; and so, pointing
out "TOMMY MOOHE'S Oak," my driver leaves me to winder
about the meadows, and admire the scenery, while he refreshes him-
self and the horse, and gets the spring mended.
A lovely spot! And, a propos of TOMMY MOORE'S Oak," a tra-
veller in Ireland ought to have MOOBE at his fingers' ends. Inspired
by the traditional poetry of the place, I lie by the stream, and burst
into song:—
"I 'm here at Avoca "The lambkins are bleating,
Arrived in a /,"//• car, The minutes are fleeting,
But now I have no car The waters are meeting,
Itekuse the spring broke. By' TOMMY MOOBE's Oak.'"
Happy Thought.—for this, as a May poem, to call it, in allusion
to the accident that brought me here, The Break of the Spring.
The car is mended with some cord and a stout piece of wood. As
the driver professes himself satisfied, why, so do I. Of one thing I
am perfectly certain, that, as far as mending the spring goes, I could
not have done it better myself. Again he urges on his wild career.
Undoubtedly there is no more advantageous way of seeing the
country than travelling everywhere by car. At first you run the
chance of establishing a wry neek for the remainder of your days.
This can be avoided by occasionally changing seats with your driver,
to whom position is not nine points of the Law of the Koad. Riding
on a car is an art; and only those who have a natural turn of the
neck for it acquire it easily. The question is how to be the looker-on
who will see most of the game with the least amount of discomfort,
including the smallest possible chance of being jerked off, inadver-
tently, round a corner.
The first method is to sit side-saddle-wise, holding, of course, on
to the tail. Every Saxon visiting Ireland for 1 he first time holds on
to the rail of a car. The habitue does not. The latter rides fear-
lessly, jauntily, eaaily. He seems to spring with the car, to rise
when it rises, to fall when it falls (which I duln't, thank goodness!),
and, in fact, to yield to all its motions gracefully.
You feel, on a car, that the possibility is offered you of looking all
ways at once; that somehow this can be done, if you only know note
to do it. You can't helrj trying it. You look behind; you look
before; you look to the right; you look to the left; and you wish,
you were Janus—the only person except Argus, perhaps, whoso
natural peculiarity would have specially suited him for an habituS
of an Irish outside car.
Happy Thought.—Combine the two as a title for a Tourists' Book,
and call it Fe-argus O'Janus; or, Two Heads are Better than One!
Suing a Narrative of a Journey of a Thousand Miles on an Outside
Car.
Woodenbridge.—Another lovely spot! Such an air of calm and
rest as we arrive, at eventide, at this comfortable-looking hotel,
which commands a view of one of the most picturesque parts of the
country through which the line of rail passes. 1 dine, and am

sorry affair for such a bright-looking Hostelrie. Perhaps "in the

caftis, per tot discrimina rerum—I arrive att he terminus.
The English travellers in the train (for Killarney)
with me do me the honour of taking me for an Irishman,
and consult me on the subject of Dublin, Bray, and
WickW generally. This is gratifying. I am acclima-
tised. Only I wish they wouldn't ask me about "tiw
hunting here in the winter "—and " what those moun-
tains are in the distance?" Also, an elderly Saxon
asks m«, "What counties arr we passing through
now?" I don't like to guess, and I don't want to dispel
the illusion,—which has something in it of comedy for
me—by referring at once to Slack's Guide.
Mem.—Another.time to read up the Guide beforehand.
With a very little superficial knowledge, " crammed" at
breakfast time, one could impose on these simple-
minded tourists to any extent. Then they would writ*
in their diaries, "Met an Irish Gentleman in the train,
who told us tlkatthe finest trout were to beobtamed," &c,
&c. "He also gave ns somf valuable information as to
the state of the country. He seemed intelligent, witk
a very prono«*ced broguo, probably that of some Western
provinciality.''
KzUarney.—At lout! My first view of Killarney is
from the window of the Hotel omnibns, about mine
OT clock on a pitch-dark night, only illumined by the
oceasieoal gas lamps, which show me that I *m being
takes through some sort of a town-then out of it, by
a tediously long drive up to the Hotel on the Lake,
named after Her Most Gracious Majesty.
Of the Lake or the Mountains I cannot even catch
a glimpse. I have arrived like the guest who will come
too early to a party, and who has to wait till the candles
are lighted, before he can see the decorations of the
/salon. Or, I have arrived after the opera is over, and
the box-keepers have draped the house in majestic
brpwn-holland. Or, I am not "in the;Season,' and
Killarney is not on view. At all events I must wait
either till " The Moon hat Lit her Lamp above"—as
the ballad in the Lily of Killarney has it,—or, if the
Moon doesn't do this, I must patiently await Aurora.
Being a Lady, she has a right to be unpunctual.
On retiring for the night, I attempt to make out some-
thing from the bedroom window. I fancy I see the lake.
It is very close—not the lake, which may be a mile
off, for aught I know—but the weather. "They say'
it always rains at Killarney.
Morning.—'Tis all my fanny painted it 1 'tis lovely,
'tis divine! The " Victoria "is beautifully situated—
couldn't, in fact, be better; and of course everybody
showing the'hoighth of civility—but in Ireland, cela ra
sans dire. What if my bell is more ornamental than
useful? and what if I vainly expend my labour in at-
tempting to summon the Boots, or the Chambermaid ;•
Am I not more than repaid for my trouble by the
pains immediately taken by the Manager, by the Pro-
Erietor (who comes from some distance on purpose)
y the Barmaids, by the Boots (who ought to have hearc
it ring, but didn't), by the Waiter (who happened to
be standing near the other Waiter, when it" might have
rung, and he not known it"), and, lastly, by the Ostler
who, having nothing whatever to do with the interior
economy of the house, goes out of his way (happening
to be passing through) to give his opinion as to this par-
ticular bell f And these all assemble—first in the pas-
sage, then on the stairs, then outside, on the lawn, to
look up to where my room is, when I harangue them
as if it were an election, from the window. As only
my tipper, and my better half, is visible, the effect
from below, must resemble that produced by Punch in
the show, when he is looking out for that provoking
puppet "Joey" the Clown, who will insist on hiding
round the corner. My audience, one after another, give
their opinion and their advice on the subject: a pro-
ceeding which occupies a good half-hour after I have
already employed twenty minutes in vain endeavour
at making the bell sound.
I venture to say I never yet met with so much genuine and hearty comimstra-
ion, so much real sympathy, and so little help (for no one did anything), as on
his occasion of my not having been able to make my bedroom bell heard;
and when the subject is finally exhausted, I have quite forgotten what on earth
t was 1 had wanted when I first pulled that bell-rope.
The Landlord offers to change my room. I shall be provided with a tirst-
•ate bell, only I shall not have such a first-rate view. I prefer my present
>elle vue to his view of the bell. (This jeu de mot can be worked up to thus:
'When SIDNEY SJUTH was travelling in Ireland, he happened," &c.)
I stay here some days, and the bell never does answer, and, consequently, no
one ever answers the bell. But as some external repairs are going on, which
necessitate th« prw»n«* in the garden of at least three of the household at a
;iro*, including always either the Manager or the Proprietor, I find that,
when I want anything, my most simple plan is to, first, ring the bell, on the
ckancf (for while there is life and a bell-pull there is hope—or while there is a
rope there is a hope), and then put my head out of window, repeating the Punch
HTturmance, and shout, as if I were being held back by an assassin in the bed-
room, and were struirslingto escape on to the top of the verandah, until some
one below asks quietly, "WTiat is it, Sorr ?" or politely, "Did you call, Sir 'f'
It's a long process, but it is an exercise of several virtues, and, in the end, it
succeeds.
Early Morning.—The usual thing, of course. There is nothing for it but
"the beaten track." There is, however, only one tourist besides myself at the
Botel just now—the others are leaving, or have left—and he has started inde-
pendently. 1 put myself in the Landlord's hands. He tells me I shall want a
lorse and car, a pony for.crossing the mountain, a couple of boatmen and a boat
For the lake, and luncheon for myself and the aforesaid boatmen. Great
preparations. But lead on! I follow!
The trap is at the door—outside car of the kighest respectability, and with
the best-looking horse 1 've yet seen. "He '« new to the work," says my driver,
"but he '11 be all right. Jump up, Sorr!" And we trot away.
DIARIES, DIARIES, DIARIES!

Mr. Punch a batch of
their multiform Diaries,

fat and lean, limp and

whatever form, or for
whatever purpose days
can be recorded, here is
a record handy, from
the firm of SMITH.
If, as there is wisdom
in the multitude of coun-
sellors, there were sav-
ing of time in the mul-
titude of Diaries, no
man need henceforth
lose a day. But is there
not reason to fear, on the other hand, that, in the multiplicity of Diaries, days
may be lost—as men have been lost in the labyrinths of the catacombs? Mean-
while, we shall look with respect at MESSES. SMITH'S heap of multiform Diaries
as a reminder of thevalueof thosedays whose employment we fear Mr. Punch will
never enterintnem. Of "scribbling" he has sufficient already from his Correspon-
dents: and he has enough to do in recording the day's works in the week's pages.

AMENITIES OF THE HONEYMOON.
"Doy'r MOVE, DABLISO !—I'M so COMFOBTABLP, AND TOTTB HEAD is so SOFT!!'
THE MOST IMPOETANT MEETING YET.
THE Three Tailors of Tooley Street met yesterday in as large a
number as was possible, in order to discuss the position of the United
Kingdom with regard to the East.
The Meeting would have been held with closed doors, but there
being only one door, it was considered superfluous to close it, par-
ticularly as no strangers showed any desire to come in.
The Second Tailor voted the First Tailor into the Chair. This
was immediately seconded by the Third Tailor, and carried by a
very large majority.
The First Tailor said that he should have been most proud to have
taken the Chair, but unfortunately it had already been taken under
a distress for last month's rent. (Loud cheers.) The proposed
Chairman went on to say that it would be quite in keeping with the
object of the Meeting, and with their professional capacity, if they
were to sit cross-legged. (Great cheering, during which the Meeting
crossed their legs and took their seats.)
The first Resolution was proposed by the Third Tailor, who said
that he considered that all Turks should be exterminated. "With
that view he had already expunged Turkey from a map belonging
to a friend of his. and hoped it might aid the cause materially.
(Cheers.) He would move a Resolution to the following effect :—
"That this Meeting, comprising as it does the principal inhabitants
of the United Kingdom "—(" Hear, hear.'")—'1 would suggest to HER
MAJESTY that all affairs of State should be at once committed to
their charge, when probably a proper solution of the Eastern Ques-
tion would be arrived at." (Loud cheers.)
The Resolution was carried by an overwhelming majority, the
President giving his casting vote.
The Second Tailor thought that some pecuniary relief should be
sent out to the sufferers (" Hear .hear.'"). and that it should be
done at once. (Great cheering.) He should therefore ask the Presi-
dent of the Meeting to lend him a shilling; half of which he would
pledge himself to spemd in beer (Cheers), and would promise to owe
the other half to any nonorary Treasurer who might be appointed.
The President, after having re-crossed his legs and remarked
that he was in hourly expectation of letters of apology from all the
Crowned Heads of Europe for not attending the meeting, went on
to say that he fully concurred in what had been said. "With regard
to the shilling it was matter for consideration, and would probably
take some weeks to decide. Nevertheless, he had no objection to
other members of the meeting subscribing largely to the relief of
the sufferers. (Murmurs.) Should HER MAJESTY decline to accede to
their petition, they might take matters into their own hands. They
surely ought to get something out of it. (Loud cheers.) He con-
cluded with a fervent appeal to the Second Tailor to stand something.
This having been seconded by the Third Tailor, it was carried by an
enthusiastic majority.
A somewhat warm discussion followed, after which the meeting
uncrossed its legs and tossed for coppers till it dispersed.
NEW. READINGS OF BYRON.
Is a late number of the Newcastle Daily Chronicle, the property
of MH. JOSEPH COWEN, M.P., we find a full report of a recent
speech by that Gentleman on the Bulgarian Atrocities. The speaker
quoted—very much to the purpose—BYROX'S well-known picture of
the lean dogs holding their carnival over the dead under the walls
of Corinth. The report in printing the quotation gives us—
"From a Tartar's akull they had stripped the flesh,
As ye feed theptg when tte fruit is fresh."
"We have been accustomed to see the line printed—
"As yonpeel the fig," &o.,
but we fully acknowledge the boldness of the correction.
So for the accepted reading—
"As they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead,"
MR. COWEX'S organ gives us—
"At they largely resembled the bones of the dead."
To whom are we indebted for these improvements—to Ma. COWKN's
Compositor or to MR. COWES's Corrector P In either case, we have
to thank him for a sensation. "Crede BfRoyf" Not we—in
future; till the noble Bard has passed through the office of the
Newcastle Daily Chronicle.

AND DARING.
QUESTION mayberaiset
on the motto adoptee
by LORD BEACONS-
FLKLD: Forti nihL
difficile. Is this true:
Can it be verily
affirmed that nothing
is difficult for a brave
man? Is not Latin
difficult? Is not
Greek difficult? L
not Geometry diffi-
cult? Is not Algebra
difficult? Nav, are
not French and Ger-
man difficult, and is
not simple Arithmetic
difficult; are not
Multiplication, Divi-
sion, the Rule of
Three, and Practice
difficult, and a doosid
deal too difficult, for
numbers of brave
men? Is there not
far too many a brave
young man as ready
and willing as natu-
rally qualified, to
lead a forlorn hope,
who, mainly perhaps
because of that very
qualification, is de-
barred from ever
doing so in any higher
capacity than that of
a private soldier by his inability to pass a difficult examination?
Suppose instead of "Forti," his Lordship were to read "SEVENTY nihil
difficile f Is he prepared to put the difficulty to the test, by trying to persuade
Lngland into his view of the Eastern Question and how to answer it'" Or is he
too old a bird to try?
NOT BEFORE IT '3 WANTED.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
IN your public capacity as Mentor and Adviser,
will you kindly suggest to Preceptors of Colleges and the
Committee of Council for Education that a new Science be
added to the existing Curriculum—a science imperatively
called for by the wants of the present day. I mean the
Science ot Drawing-room Navigation,'* by the study
of which young men may be enabled to move in socir ty
without entangling their heels in Ladies' dresses, crushing
lap-dogs, pulling over articles of virtu, or light furniture,
plunging ankle-deep into pots of valuable ferns, upset-
ting ink-stands, card-trays, &c. They may also acquire
the art of resisting the attraction of the lace antimacas-
sars of chairs and ottomans, which seem to have a peculiar
tenacity of adherence to any button more prominent than
usual.
Yours to command,
POLONAISE.
UTRUM MAVIS ACCIPE.
CANON LIDDON and MR. MALCOLM McCon in their
voyage down the Danube, saw bodies impaled on the
Turkish shore. MUSUBUS BEY, Turkish Ambassador in
London, writes, at once, to the Times to deny this on the
part of the'' proper authority," and to charge the reverend
witnesses with ft optical illusion, if nothing worse."
Which is most consonant with probability and ex-
perience, that the Turk should shrink from staking his
victims, and that two English clergymen, with characters
io lose and their senses about them, should have said or
seen the thing that was not, or that the "proper autho-
rity " in Turkey should have first told a lie, and then
charged MUSUKUS BET to repeat it?
We leave the Bey impaled on whichever horn he
ueases of that dilemma.
One thing we should recommend him, at all events;
not to stake his own credit on that of any Turkish autho-
rity—proper or improper.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
A Music Feast—Dinner—CLAY and WAOXSR.
Sra,
WHAT chances are these! Music's the food of Love. Why
here B my own WAGNER in London, with MR. CABL ROSA at the
Lyceum. Ah, .Rosa / Sonheur ! (an artistic ieu de mot at eighteen-
pence an hour,—reduction on taking a quantity).
Haven't I returned from Bayreuth full of WAGNEE. As MR.
BYRON says in Little Don Ctesar de £a:an, "Am I not a man
and a Bey-reuther!" —which, of all the puns —Oh, Sir, I
l(^e t Wl- dell8ht- I QU£ my elbow into my neighbour's
ribs—there is no moral law against digging your elbow into
your neighbour's ribs, I believe—and then I had my fun, for /
explained the juke to htm. By the way, Sir. I know a man (with
most people you may generally interpret this phrase correctly by
inserting a negative before the verb; but not so with me)—well,
1 know a man who, being naturally obtuse, has determined to obtain
tor himself a fine appreciation of humour. His theory is, " It must
vlULme~JU3t as my milseles are in my arm—only that they won't
itty tons unless I exercise them: so for my ' sense of humour'
—my eighth sense—that, too, is in me, and if I only work it, it will
bestrong enough to grapple with fifty puns." So what does he do?
Why, he passes his life among wits—not professionals, who don't
throw away their capital, but among amateur wits, funny men
sayers of good things at small parties, and he works out their>wjr
de mots on paper, just as he would so many problems in Algebra.
.Let xbe the meaning of the joke which has escaped him. Good •
tnen he gets the other known quantities, including the joke itself,
uts on his dressing-gown, spreads his paper, pours out a libation of
ink, flourishes his quill-and at it he goes, with all the vigour of a
LOLEKSO reducing the Book of Numbers to a question of figures.
1 was dmmg with my old friend and pitcher, the ex-Turkish
Sinister s private ex-secretary, who held a post in the Turkish
Army years ago (after a dinner with me, I have seen him holding a
fost,—& lamp-post in Piccadilly—and most unwilling to part with
it) ana the rare old Moslem,—his name is PEGWELL BET—a small
chap a mere shrimp of a fellow to look at, but a prawn in pitched
battle, a lobster in the field, a crab in a combat,—he savs to me
sipping his second bottle of sherbet— (we call it sherbe't, out of
respect to the Bey's scruples, but if there ever was real good Pom-
mery from the caves of MADAME POMMERY, and if ever there was
Comet Port—with nuts—in this world, it was between us, entre nous,
at that moment), he says, "How about music to-night?"
I replied—
"Last night, when undisturbed by State affairs,
Uoisttning our clay, and puffing off our cares!"
"Swnbastes!" cried the wily Bey, as well-read a man as any
that ever wore/«z or drank fizz .'
"The Bulbul is right," I replied, in true Oriental fashion; for
though a man of the world, he still likes to be called a Bulbul.
"You are right. Did you notice I said clay 1" I asked.
"CLAY, by all 'means," returned the Bulbul, chucking up his can
in the air. "Here's his health!"
"How about Toto?" I asked my PEGWEI.L BEY.
"Allah is good! Allah is kind! MAHOMET is his Prophet!
CLAY is good; and I hope Toto is his profit. I have not seen it.'"
L- ~, - —— something good v« *^u
. e^went on—" and I hope that he has succeeded in toto."
"That, my Bulbul, would make a capital advertisement," I
observed, "Success in toto."
"True, my jolly Christian dog," returned the Bey. "Good sher-
bet needs no bush, but a Clay is all the better for a little judicious
puffing.
1 suggested a programme;—a night wi' CLAY, and one with
WAGNER.
"What night with CLAY?" asked the Bey, who is such a Wag-
nerite that he might be called the Bey of Beyrouth.
"My distinguished Bulbul," I replied, "will see that CLAY'S
night is, at present, Don Quixote, the Knight of La Mancha."
There's no difficulty just now in London in hearing the works of
WAGNER. They 've got extracts from that composition whose name
can scarcely be mentioned to ears polite, I allude to the Gotterdiini-
merutig,—while SANTLEY is airing his nobby lungen (Bavarian dia-
lect for "wonderful lungs") at the Lyceum in the Flying Dutchman.
Ihe Bey, whose English gets muddled occasionally, could not
remember this title; he would call it the Flying Dustman, and I
rather fancy he was thinking of the Italian version, L1Olandese

ing to MB. RIPLET'S Holbornian Restaurant Band assisting our
digestion with the melodious overture to Tannhauser.
Then to the Alhambra.
TheBulbul was delighted with the Ballet, and the performances
of the Fiendish GIRABDS, who are fearfully and wonderfully made
up. They are not out of place at the Alhambra—on the contrary;
but they arc out of place in the Comic Opera, Don Quixote. MB. CLAY
has written some charming Ballet music, and the Chivalry Song is
the best in the piece.
But the Opera should have been a Bouffe, somebody like MB. FBED
VOKES (though the GTRARDS outvokes YOKES, I *m afraid); for the
Don, and MB. PATJLTON, with the Song of " Proverbs Gone Wrong"
BM Sancho Panza. Anyhow, the GIRABDS, who have nearly put the
noses of the " Fiji Flutterers " out of joint (lucky for the latter it is
"noses," and not legs or arms), are well worth a visit.
Then to the Lyceum. It was the second night of the Flying
Dutchman, and it' a crowded house and genuine enthusiasm— (the sing-
ing of MDIXE. TOBBIANI and MB. SANTLEY in the Second Act created
a perfect furore)—go for anything, then MB. GAEL ROSA may con-
gratulate himself, as I heartily congratulate him, on one of the
biggest operatic successes that has been witnessed in town for many
a long day. With the Lyceum orchestra and chorus there is scarcely
a fault to be found; the size, the acoustic properties of the house,
and HERB WAGNEB'S wind instruments, being taken into considera-
tion. The music flows on from first to last, never once interrupted
by that cold-water curse of English opera, which has been hitherto
considered necessary to the intelligible rendering of a plot—the dia-
logue, which generally falls as flat as the "spoken" in an old-
fashioned comic song.
The Second Act of TheFlying Dutchman is, to my thinking, too
long, for the climax is reached when Vanderdecken enterSj and is
recognised by Lenta. To bring the act-drop down on this situation
would have been a dramatic effect too conventional perhaps for
HEBB WAGNER. I propose, Sir, to return to the consideration of this
striking opera on another occasion. After it, the Bey and myself
sought the Lane of the Maiden where we are accustomed to pass
some " half-hours with the Best Oysters." And so for the present
I remain, Wagnaiianly,

RUMOURED TURKISH REFORMS.
IT is whispered that the following particulars, amongst others, of
a project for Turkish Reform, have been submitted by the Great
European Powers to the Sublime Porte :—
The SULTAN to accord his subjects a Constitution, and himself to
be transformed into a Constitutional Sovereign. Turkey in Europe
and Turkey in Asia to be consolidated into a Limited Monarchy,
with Representative Institutions.
The Legislature, with the SULTAN, acting by responsible Ministers,
at its head, to consist of a Senate and Chamber of Deputies; the
latter electing the former, and elected itself with Vote by Ballot
and Universal Suffrage, embracing the political Rights of Women.
Mahometanism, as the State Religion, to be disestablished and
disendowed, and all sects and denominations to be placed upon a
footing of absolute equality.
The universal establishment of Trial by 7ury. Jurors to be
eligible irrespective of creed.
A general system of Compulsory Education, admitting denomina-
tional schools; but where these are found inadequate, administered
by School Boards, with' authority to levy Rates to any amount suffi-
cient to defray all necessary expenses.
Cheap administration of justice by means of County Courts, to be
established in Counties, into which the entire Turkish Empire shall
be divided for that purpose. Regular and periodical Gaol Deliveries,
Assizes, and Quarter Sessions.
THE BEST PART OF A LIFE.
THE strength of Onions is proverbial. Hercules may be supposed
to have been typified by the Onion, because the Onion, like himself,
is so uncommonly strong. But though it be excellent to have an
Onion's strength, 'tis tyrannous to use it like an Onion, such an one
as one WILLIAM ONION, had up on Wednesday last week at Worship.
Street, charged with being drunk and disorderly, and with having
committed a violent assault on ROBERT HILL, 101 H. ONION had
been found by the Constable in Leman Street, Whitechapel, standing
over a man whom he had just knocked down, like an ONION strong
enough and savage enough to knock down anybody. The Constable
tried to persuade him to go home, when ONION refused, and, besides
expressing himself in generically strong language, abused his
strength by violently kicking the Constable's shins, and trying to
kick him in a still more dangerous manner.
"In answer to questions by the Magistrate, the Constable said the priBonei

No doubt he had; and it is a fact which, however obvious, is not
perhaps so well considered as it ought to be, that the best part of
every ruffian's life, and of the life of every habitual offender and
criminal, is that which be spends in gaol. This truth was perhaps
within the view of MR. DE RUTZBN, the Magistrate before whom
this most offensive ONION was brought to justice, when he sentenced
that specimen of the dangerous classes to six months' imprisonment

and on the treadmill. It is a pity the Magistrate could not have
given, him more. The best part of a life such as OSION'S is spent in
gaol indeed when he is kept there longest.
;WHYS AND MEANS.
WHY do people write that they "accept with pleasure" an
unpleasant invitation, when they really mean that they do so with
reluctance?
Why do Ladies bid their servant say that they are not at home,
when they mean they are engaged or unwilling to see visitors?
Why do Cockneys often say they have been cruising in the
Channel, when they mean that they have had a shilling sail at
Worthing?
Why do Actors grumble that the Drama is going to the dogs,
when they mean that they themselves are not in favour with the
Publio?
Why'do Men tell their Wives that they will be detained by busi-
ness, when they really mean to be detained by a Club dinner?
Why do Women bid their husbands escort them to the West-End,
when they really mean to make them pay for a new bonnet?
Why do Singers speak with diffidence of the powers of their voice,
when they mean to swallow greedily all the compliments you give
them?
Why do Inviters often call their country house a "little place,
when they mean to show you a palatial residence?
Why does your Friend tell you "any toggery'will do," when he
means himself to sport a dress suit and white-choker?
Why do China Dealers name so preposterous a Drioe, when they
mean to jump at less than half if they be offered it?
Why do people say they will be really charmed to see you when-
ever you drop in, whereas they really mean to shelve you by so
vague an invitation?
Why do Voters whisper "Oh, no; I couldn't think of it," when
they mean to pocket as much as may be handed them?
Why do Pianists complain that they are sadly out of practice when
they are asked to play, while in reality they mean they want more
pressing, and then will gladly yield to it?
And why do Waiters generally tell you they are " Coming, Sir!'
when nine times out of ten they mean that they are going?

A SONG FOR A HARVEST SUPPER.
(By an Eastern Counties Disciple of SIR WILFRID LAWSON.)
Now Harvest be over, let's sociable meet,
And enjoy the delights of a Temperance treat:
All liquors fermented right nobly we scorn,
Fur they lead men to mischief, sure's ever they 're born.
No Beer nor no Cider we '11 draa for our feast;
They turn a good Christian into a beast.
Nor we doan't need no Sperrits our mirth to inspire,
Fur we doan't want to set brain and body atire.
Haarvest homes we hev heerd on, most tumble tales,
Wheer drink 'toxicatun were sarved out in pails:
Wheer chaps sot a swillun like hogs in a stye,
Till most on 'em under the taable did lie.
Nixt marnun hids achun hands shnkun they feel,
No appetite nayther to swaller a meal;
And tho' to the'ir day's work they strive fur to tarn,
No more 'n a brass farden they manage to am.
In no sech divarsions enjoyment we find;
Fur losing our sinses ain't much to our mind:
We purfer to set sober, and keep our hids clear,
And not make un duzzy wi' drinkun drugged beer.
"We like to lead dacent respectable lives,
And save a few puns for our children and wives:
Not go waastun our waages in wettun our throats,
And pawnun for drink both our weskits and coats.
So come, my brave comrades, Teetotallers all!
Three cheers fur our Maister and Missus I call!
Fur she is a good woman, she purwides us good cheer,
Tea and Corfy in galluns, and prime Gingerbeer.
Come, fill up a bumper! come, fill every man!
Fill to brimmun the Tea-pot, pass round the Milk-can!
No hidache ull harm us, no fever we '11 fear,
While we drink nawthun stronger nor good Gingerbeer!
A FIELD TOO OFTEN PLOUGHED.
THE excitement created by the Bulgarian atrocities will have
subsided only to be followed by another outburst of equally vehe-
ment indignation, which cannot but be aroused by the following
passage in a letter to the Times on the subject of " Ostrich Farming
at the Cape " :—
"Birds are kept solely for the feathers. They are plucked every eight
months, and will average at each plucking £10 worth of feathers after the
first plucking, which are chicken feathera and are not so valuable."
What amount of torture inflicted upon poor dumb animals by
vivisection, for the benefit of suffering humanity, can equal the
torments to which wretched Ostriches are subjected periodically
every eight months to no worthier or better purpose than that ot
subservience to the vanity of Fashion? Let every Professor, or
Graduate who has once been a student, imagine what it must be to
be so repeatedly plucked. Of course the anti-vivisectionist enthu-
siasts, who even during the busy Summer found time to stnmp the
country inveighing against the barbarities perpetrated by physiolo-
gists on frogs, cannot now for very shame fail to devote a portion o:
their Autumnal leisure to corresponding denunciation of the cruelty
for which Ladies of rank and wealth are responsible by continuing
to wear head-dresses which require thousands of Ostriches to have
the quills of their tail feathers wrenched at intervals of only eigh
months each from their quivering sockets. Nor can it be but tha
amiable humanitarians, who sympathise so keenly with vivisected
rabbits and guinea-pigs, will everywhere exert their utmost influ-
ence to get petitions drawn up for presentation to the QrjEEy
humbly imploring Her Most Gracious MAJESTY to be gracionsl;
pleased to command that the usage of wearing Ostrich feathers a
Royal Drawing-Rooms and State Balls be henceforth discontinued.

ANIMAL AUTOGRAPHS.
HERE is a Book announced under
the title of Animalt Painted by
Themsrh-e*.
The For is the only animal we
know of who pos-
sesses a hrush, but
whether he can
paint with it we
have yet to learn.
But thin is, of
course only our
little joke, which
we must have: we
know perfectly
well that the title
maybe taken figu-
ratively. The head-
ings of the chapters
no doubt will be
more or less (more,
perhaps) as fol-
lows :—
The Lion.—
King of the Beasts
— Much received
in Society—Adored
by the Ladies —
Never met GORDON
CUMMTNO—Paws
soft and effeminate
— Naturally mild
and philanthropic.
The Bear.—Elegant Action of—Agreeable Manners—Charming Tenor Voice—Fond of Waltzing
—At the Head of the Pole—Has a Hug for every Friend.
The Fox.—Naturally frank and open—Would not hurt a Chicken for Worlds—Always liked

Sour Grapes—The Best Friend will
Hounds.
The Pig.—The Victim of Slander
-His Clean Habits—His Sweet Home
—His Abstemiousness and Remark-
able Temperance — His Plaintive
Warble, and his Love of Hebrew.
The Ass.—His Musical j Talents—
His Tender Lips—Activity in Bond-
age—Willing Acquiescence when
asked to Gallop.
The Monkey.—Greek Type De-
veloped—Superiority to Man—Dra-
matic Powers. &c., &c., &c.
The Work promises to be most
amusing, if not instructive. We
only hope it will be illustrated by
Animals. Why not? Badgers have
been most successfully drawn by
Dogs; and few Horses but have
drawn a carte de riiite. So we re-
peat, Why not?
Poor Womankind.
DEAU OLD PUNCH,
I HOPE you do not approve
of such truly manly selfishness as
DK. BLADE'S, who, after his wife has
?one to her rest, cruelly breaks it
by making her come back to earn
his bread for him! As a Married
Woman I protest against such be-
haviour to one of our ill-used sex.
Your old Friend,

THE BELL-EINGEES.
(A Devonshire Dream, after the Church Congress at
Plymouth.)
"The bells are the external voice of the Church, and as Catholic as the
Church itself."—RBV. C. P. H. BARLOW, i» the diseiusion on " Church Belli,
and How to Use 2'htm," which wound up the meeting of the Church Congress
at Plymouth.
"Any man, however dull his intellect, can learn to do what is called round-
ringing. Change-ringing is very different ... The learning of the latter is
a matter of impossibility to some men; others only go a very short way in the
art; and, of course, others attain greater or less prouciency.—MB. C. A. W.
TROTTE, President of the Devonshire Guild of Mmgers, in the tame discussion,
THE Jackdaw, perched on the belfry-eaves,
As he peeped through a network of ivy-leaves,
Saw a Clerical Congress, in cassocks and copes,
Tugging away at a tangle of ropes,
To the sound of something between curse and benison,
The comment of outspoken ABCHDEACON DENISON.
The cassocks rustled, the copes and stoles
Fluttered and flounced, as those well-meaning souls
Toiled, tugged, and strained, lint they couldn't keep time.'
Which, of course, plays the mischief with peal or chime.
So_the net result was a vigorous jangle,
With the clappers at odds, and the ropes in a tangle,
And the pullers as loud as their bells in wrangle!
"Oho," quoth the Jackdaw, "hereby hangs a tale!
In their craft these black-coated Bell-ringers fail:
I must teach them there needs more than vigour and zeal
In the pullers, to sound an harmonious peal?'
Then he hopped in among them, sans bow or apology,
And propounded his views upon Church Campanology.
"Brother black-coats," he cried, "out of tune, out of time,
While you thus tug. no wonder your bells fail to chime.
Round-ringing! Most likeness, methinks, might be found
In your work to what pugilists mean by a ' round.'
Change-ringing! Suggestive in these days of 'movements,'
Of changes the country calls aught but improvements;
Though e'en mutability's gale you might weather,
If somehow you 'd manage to change all together:
But some change in one key, and some in another,
And each ringer's chief aim seems his fellow to smother,
Till trebles and basses, to keep time unable,
Clash into cacophony—mere bells of Babel!
Peal-ringing! Well that, one would think, might be, verily,
A labour of love all would join in right merrily;
Tintinnabular pastime instead of a toil;
But e'en jubilates a jangle will spoil.
And joy-peals are marred, if some obstinate bell
Will go in, on its private account, for a knell.
To join in a treble-bob-major sounds fine,
But if one treats his bell but as summons to dine,
Another as cow-bell, of pasture suggestive,
A third as alarum to hearts high and restive ?—
If this fiery Archdeacon deems Church-bells the tocsin
Which calls to a fray he would fain exchange knocks in;
While that blandest of Bishops would rather decide
Their note is the couvre-feu bidding men hide
Latent fires of Dissent ?—if to others they bo
Mere muffin-bells, telling of tattle and tea,
Or factory-bells, brisk reveilU to work'.
For cowards to funk, and for sluggards to shirk;
Or wedding-day clashes, or funeral knells,
Or parties' loud paeans, or souls' passing-bells—
What wonder, in short, if 'ensemble ' 's past hopes,
With as many Minds as you 've Men at the ropes?
Now, since to keep tune is a dream, were't not well,
To muffle your noisiest tongues for a spell?
Or at least not proclaim in too public a way,
That a symphony's just the one thing you can't play?
While each tugs his own rope, and will tug it alone,
As heedless of time, as of tune and of tone,
Expending his strength in his self-centred labours,
With a cool disregard for the ' notes' of his neighbours,
Why, unison, harmony, music, are things
Which not WAGNER himself could get out of your 'rings'—
And English Church-music, however you strain,
As 'music' must still' of the future' remain."
Here the Bird hopped aloft, and those Bell-ringers stared.
A few optics half twinkled, but most of them glared.
Said their Leader, at last, Well, he lays down the law;
But you see, after all, he is only a Daw!
A mere saucy Lay-creature, though given to perch
In saucy intrusion outside of the Church.
Pull away! pull away! Give a right Plymouth peal!"
So they tugged—to what tune only Time can reveal.

poraries; nevertheless a local paper
announces that there are now on

the Gourd kind, weighing respect-
ively forty and twenty-nine pounds;
labelled, "Two Fine Vegetable
Creams." Confounding one species

dear! I have taken mental notes of those pockets en biais and that
sweet capuchon all the way over.
Mrs. Candytuft. Dear girl! Poor thing! I wonder the Count
allows such a fragile flower to travel alone!

Ulster pocket). Aw—yes. JUSTERINI'S best, I asshaw you.
Aristocratic Stranger. Thanks. Awfully thanks. (She does take
a drop.) That will bring me round, I dare say.
Another hour is supposed to elapse, during which the Family CAN-

who is observed to snigger occasionally.

"SPIRITUALISM" IN SPAIN.
A CORRESPONDENT of the Times lately attended the Festival
annually held at the Shrine of "Our Lady of Montserrat." He
quotes the following: attestation of something which was a genuine
miracle indeed—if true :—
"On the little papers sold as memorials of the day the following is printed: —
"' The image of the Virgin which to-day we worship was pointed out to
some shepherds, in the year 880, near this steep, by miraculous lights from
Heaven. The shepherds told the priest; the priest told the Bishop. The
Bishop tried to more the image to Manresa, but it refused to more further
than this crag: so they built here a Chapel to receive it, and we worship it
here to-day. This is our Heaven-sent Cathedral of the Mountains.'"
Is the foregoing statement put forth and vended hy the permission,
or with the knowledge, of the present successor of the Bishop who
was told hy the Priest, who was told hy the Shepherds 996 years
ago of the miraculous image to which they said they were guided by
lights from Heaven? If he endorses, of course he personally believes
it. Now, is the Bishop of Manresa, that now is, a liberal, large-
minded prelate, whose ideas are not bounded by his own diocese.P
Then what a good work is open for him to do for the confutation of
scepticism and sceptics all the world over! He has only to take the
very slight trouble of attempting, like his predecessor nearly a
thousand years ago, to move the object which he permits Ids flock to
worship. Suppose it will not move—refuses to come out of its
shrine, or lets itself be carried only so far as it chooses and no
farther; then stops short, immovable by any amount of force. This
simple experiment, if only successful, could not fail to convince all
doubters and unbelievers, it having been tried in public, with due
notice to all mankind, and every possible facility afforded them to
see that there was no deception. If, in the sight of all men, the
image were to jib, and persist in jibbing, and resisting every impulse
or traction, declining; even to obey the mandate, enforced with the
strong arm of a British "Bobby" to move on, such evidence of
intelligent, indomitable, supernatural agency would surely be suffi-
cient to satisfy the most incredulous ot even scientific men. The
stationary image of Montserrat would be a standing miracle indeed.
As such it would infinitely transcend the automatic Psycho, and, if
MASKELYNE AITD COOKE were to investigate and confess they could
not explain it, would perhaps induce PROFESSORS TTNDALL and
1.1 u x i.i:v, and even PROFESSOR PUNCH himself, to join in a pilgrimage
to Montserrat, with peas in their boots.
COOL!
A YOtrtro German Lady of Mr. Punch's acquaintance, when a
solitary and friendless stranger in London, offered by advertisement
to give lessons in her own language and music, and asked for " an
answer, naming terms." Here is one of the answers she received.
Mr. Punch prints it as an illustration of the amazing coolness of
some people in their dealings with Governesses :—
"MADAM.—Be pleased to answer the following questions:—Where were
you born? Where educated? Where did you receive your musical education?
Can you play the compositions of the Great Masters at sight? When and
under whom did you study drawing? Can you teach your own language
grammatically? Are you prepared to give four hours' tuition daily to my
daughters—say, one hour before breakfast, two hours after breakfast, one hour
in drawing and conversation in German every evening—in return for your
board and lodging? Are you known personally to the Hanoverian or Pruuian
Consul?
"By answering these questions, you will oblige. Yours truly,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
MR. PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
SECTION IV.—How TO FNTKR THE AEMT.

HEN Mr. Punch took his customary
seat in the anteroom, hia four pro-
mising Pupils clustered round him.
COLONEL CHARLES, of the Royal
East Mudborough Militia, was first
to greet him.
"Sir," Baid ko, "we have come
to the conclusioa that your Lectures
are full of good sense. I have
recently paid a, visit to the Head
Quarters of my Regiment. Well.
Sir, when I arrived, I was saluted
hy the Sentry on duty. Having
primed myself with the Field Ex-
ercises, I requested him to give
over his orders. He did BO glibly.
Ho said he was to pay proper com-
pliments to all Government property,
to shoot the guard in case of fire, and to keep the little boys from playing with, the
Adjutant's brougham."
"Very good indeed," commented Mr. Punch, with a smile.
"It was very good indeed, Sir," replied the Colonel, " for a first attempt."
"My dear Sir," drawled LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN GEORGE, of the Grenadiers Green,
"do you not think we had better turn our attention to the subject of your Lecture—
the mode of entering the Army ¥"
"Certainly," said Mr. Punch; and, having given dear little FIELD-MARSHAL SIR
FRANK GEEGEE, K.C.B., a hoi of snuff and the Rules of .Whist (printed in nice large
type) to play with, the Sage commenced his Lecture:—
Part I. As an Officer.—The shortest way into the Army for Gentlemen desiring to
be Officers is through the Militia. A boy fresh from school has only to attend a couple
of annual trainings to be qualified for a Commission in the Line. It is true he will have
to undergo a test examination conducted by the Civil Service Commissioners, but, as this
will be of a non-military character, he can safely leave the matter in the hands of his
coach. His real professional education will be picked up in the Militia. He will con-
sequently be wise to pay the greatest possible attention to all that he sees and hears
when he joins his Regiment. First of all, he must remember that the Militia is the old
constitutional force of the country, and that in an emergency it would serve as the real
line of defence. A Law (which is repealed from year to year) is always on the statutes,
enforcing Service in the Militia. Under these circumstances, it will be as well for him to
learn the time the Government considers necessary to drill a pack of noodles (only noodles
join the Militia), taken from the towns or the fields. After making the necessary
deductions for days given over to uniform-delivering and necessary inspection, Sundays,
wet days, and half holidays, he will discover that a fortnight is considered ample by the
Government to convert plough-boys and costermongers into patriots and soldiers. He
will also learn that, evidently with a view of fostering esprit de corps, the War Depart-
ment prefers to give the Militia an inferior rifle and a half worn-out uniform instead of
issuing new clothes and the latest improvement on the Martini-Henry. He must care-
fully remember, when he sees an undersized stripling waddling about in a coat too large
for him, trousers up to his knees, and boots after the fashion ot those worn by the Negro
serenaders, that he is not looking at a snubbed Militiaman, but at one of the proudest
specimens of BEITANNIA'S defenders. He must be careful not to laugh at the vain
attempts made by the Battalion to which he belongs to get through the work of twelve

months in as many days as a farce, or the
Report of the General Commanding the District
as a mockery. In the olden days Soldiers were
food for powder, now they are only prey for
Red Tape.
It is unnecessary to say anything about the
mode of entering the Army by competitive
examination. Mr. Punch has reason to be-
lieve that after next year only Doctors of
Divinity and Judges (of twelve years' standing)
will be qualified to compete with any chance
of success. In 1886 we may confidently expect
to find the names of the ARCHBISHOP OF CAN-
TERBURY, the LORD CHANCELLOR, and the
President of the Royal College of Physicians
at the bottom of the list of chosen candidates

for the West India Regiments. When this
triumphant result has been obtained, doubt-
less the Civil Service Commissioners will feel
that they have raised the education of the
Army to the proper standard of efficiency, and
then, but not until then, we may hope to see
the Drill-Sergeant beginning teaching every-
body the goose-step.
Part II. As a Private.—It is a much more
difficult matter for a man to enter the Army
as a Private than as an Officer. Say that a
fine spirited fellow of eighteen wishes to join
the service of the QUEEN. He is on terms of
affectionate respect with the Vicar of his
C'sh. He goes accordingly to him to ask
advice. He says that he has read stories
of daring and adventure, that he wishes to
emulate the careers of WELIINGTOH and

Should he after all this persevere in his determination to enter the
Army, then he may proudly call himself a hero—he will find himsel
duly qualified to lead the forlornest of Forlorn Hopes.
CONVERSATION ON SECTION IV.
Mr. Punch. My dear Pupils, can you tell me what a Forlorn
Hope is?
Ensign Eugene. To expect to recruit a Volunteer Regiment with-
out prizes and entertainments.
Colonel Charles. To expect to undergo a month of Military
Manoeuvres without incurring a private expenditure (to be defrayeo
by the Officers) of a couple of hundred pounds sterling.
Lieutenant and Captain George. To imagine any Military Man
will be satisfied with any scheme proposed by the War Office.
Field-Marshal Sir Frank Geegee,K.C.B. Dear little SIR FHANK
knows. It would be a Forlorn Hope for anyone to think he could
make any use of dear little SIE FRANK in the case of a European
war.
Mr. Punch. My dear Pupils, you have all answered my question
so admirably, that I can dismiss you without any further examina-
tion.
Ensign Eugene. My dear Mr. Punch, before you go can you tell
me why the Clergy are so opposed to the Army?
Mr. Punch. Certainly, my dear ENSIGN EUGENE, of the Volunteers.
The Clergy are opposed to the Army because they like to do all the
lighting amongst themselves.

"Our (Old) Boys."
WHEN will Our Soys have ceased to run?
"When ?" we ask. Echo answers " When?"
To all appearance, not until
Our lioys have run into Old Men.

However rotten this our world may be,
There's something yet more rotten in the next!
PAPERS FOR PARSONS.
ONE among the various subjects discussed at the late Church Con-
rress in relation to clerical matters was the question of "Periodical
Literature and the Daily Press." According to a rep
speeches on that topic :—
report of the
"The EEV. ERNEST FITZHOY wished that the Clergy would not only take
more trouble to supply interesting and early matter to their own organs, but
advised them to make more use of the country papers, and to read other papers
,han those which advocated their own shibboleths."
To bo sure. On the contrary, let the Clergy of conflicting sects in
.he Church look and see what the journals on the other side have to
jay. No doubt the Evangelicals, for instance, might learn much
'rom the Saturday Review, and the Ritualists would gain infonna-
Aon by reading the Record and the Rock. Clergymen of the
iitualist denomination also would do well to study a class of perio-
dicals addressed not indeed to the opposite J>arty, but to the opposite
lex. Every one of the Clergy whose cloth is chiefly muslin ought to
lave Le Follet at his fingers' end; and besides, there are the Queen,
and the Englishwoman's Magazine, and Myra's Journal of Dress
and Needletcork, containing the prettiest illustrations, as well as
etter-press, from which the reverend devotees of Ritualism might
ierive no end of useful hints and suggestions for the most charming
mprovements and inventions of sweet things in ecclesiastical
millinery.
Precepts for Parvenues.
NEVEB bow to your acquaintances from the top of an omnibus.
Never wear a flower in your buttonhole in the daytime.
Never acknowledge you have earned your fortune by labour.
Never " mop" your brow with a red silk pocket-handkerchief.
Never mention at a dinner-party what your fish-bill comes to in
tie week.
Never go in morning dress to the stalls of a theatre.
Never give less than a shilling for a farthing play-bill.
Never speak of Pantomiwes or 'Ansons.
Never wear a diamond-pin in your shirtfront.
Never parade in conversation the only Baronet you know.
Never speak familiarly of Lords you have never met.
Finally, Look as if every place you enter belonged to you.

AN EXODUS FROM EUEOPE.
THK Lombardia, in a letter from its Roman Correspondent,
announces a scheme proposed by the Armenian Patriarch, with the
sanction of the POPE, and, what is more, the SULTAN, for transfer-

cattle, build workshops, and establish and execute all the most
thriving industries of the world. The capital of the new state to be
Jerusalem, whereto, at his need or convenience, the successor of
St. Peter may transfer his Chair. Jerusalem, by means of railways,
to be "placed in connection with Bethlehem, the Dead Sea," and,
as the writer in the Lombardia says, "the other holy places." A
grand port alao will be constructed at Jaffa; lesser ports at the
smaller cities on the coast. With these. there imust likewise be
communication by rail; a Jerusalem and Joppa line, of course,
besides the Bethlehem Junction, a Dead Sea Branch, and doubtless
a Dan and Beersheba Railway. A network of electric telegraphs
must also be extended over the Holy Land, under the auspices of
the Fisherman; when the Spiritual and Temporal Power in con-
junction, patronised by the Grand Seignior, are rehabilitated at
Jerusalem. The Correspondent of the Lombardia only omits to
mention that, with a view to this re-establishment of the Sovereign
Pontificate in the metropolis of Jewry, arrangements have already
been made with an enterprising firm of Engineers at New York, for
upheaving St. Peter's Church at Borne from its foundations, and
transporting bodily to Jerusalem the whole Papacy, POPE, St. Peter's
and all.
Laying Heads Together.
"A WOMAN OF ELEVEN " writes to Punch to ask him whether, in
his last week's Honeymoon sketch, where one of the duo declares
the other's head is so soft, it is the Lady who speaks or the Gentle-
man. Punch can only reply in the words of the traditional Peep-
show Man, "Whichever you please, my little dear."
ON MY LADY IN A NEW BONNET.
By DANTE ROSSETTI RtrsntiNS.
Mr Lady hath a new and lovely Bonnet,
And in it she doth look so passing sweet,
And, altogether, 'tis so chaste and neat,
That I thereon am fain to write a sonnet.
Mesecms, whenas my Lady deigns to don it,
My heart no longer owneth me its master,
But ever beateth on from fast to faster,
Till gentle love hath penned a poem on it.
Pure white it is, with just one little rose,
That nestles next mv Lady's shining hair,
As to be planted there were its great joy.
Ah me, that I could share that dear repose —
And shelter me, for aye, in such loved lair —
Draught 'twere to me of bliss without alloy!
The Amenities of Peace.
IT is stated that the Artillery Authorities at Woolwich are so
delighted that the Eighty-one Ton Gun has broken most of the windows,
and shattered a shop-front at Shoeburyness by concussion of the
air, that they have in serious contemplation the construction of a Gun
powerful enough by its proof-discharges at Woolwich to shatter
every pane of glass in London. It is suggested by the Heavy
Ordnance Officials that the proposed Gun should be tested at Charing
Cross.

should
Such a tumble-down, ruined, patched-up-and-put-together-anyhow
quadruped I have never yet seen; in fact, there can't be a worse . .
except the animal behind him, on which another uncouth brigand,
only of a different shade of hair and complexion, is astride.
Quadrupeds these poor beasts are in appearance, i.e. they have
four legs each, but such legs! And now I perceive a man on foot
following with three other rough-coated, shambling, lack-lustre
eyed cobs, saddled and bridled.
The First Brigand, who has a bugle slung round him, but no car-
bine, thauk goodness!) salutes me respectfully, and then says some-
thing to my Driver in the language that bothered DR. JOHNSON,—
I mean the original tongue of the Sister Island. DR. SAMUEL JOHN-
SON was never so justly shut up as on that memorable occasion
when, after pedantically addressing FATHER ARTHUR O'LEARY
in Hebrew, and rudely remarking on the latter's ignorance, he was
completely and utterly dumbfounded by the latter's replying to him
in Irish. The learned SAMUEL was a snob on that occasion, and I' m
not sure that he wasn't on several other occasions as well. A man
who affects bearishness must be more or less of a snob, and it is
refreshing to think that the Doctor, who was so accustomed to have
everything his own way, should have met his match, for once at all
events, in the person of an Irish Friar, for whom no doubt the
English Lexicographer entertained the most hearty contempt.
However, this is not the subject which interests my Brigand and
Driver at this present moment.
"What are the wild men saying?" I feel inclined to sing (to
myself of course). Could I translate the real Celtic, I should say it
would mean something of this sort:—
Brigand with Bugle (to my Carman}. "I say, you 've got a bloom-
ing Saxon Tourist there. Don't keep him all to yourself. Give us
a bit. Let's get something out of him. Do: and I'll give you some
of mine when I've got one."
To which my Driver probably replies, "All right. I'm on.
Halves, you know." And so the bargain is struck. I am bought
and sold. I am the first prize of the season. This is the first
appearance in the Tourist market, and I have been disposed of at my
Carman's valuation.
My Carman touches his hat and says sotto voce to me, " That's
the Guide, Sorr; ye '11 be afther wanting him, Sorr."
I take him into my confidence.
"Do I," I earnestly ask my Driver, "do I really want him?" I
mean by thiSj don't deceive a poor Saxon Tourist, who hasn't got any
friends in this Killarney world but you; who is all alone among the
Lakes and mountains; and who would, if he must be robbed,
rather be plundered by one, and have done with it, than be per-
petually asked, politely of course, to "stand and deliver" through-
out the day's excursion.
"Ye must have a guide, Sorr, for the Pass and the Echoes; and
he 'a the best here."
This is the answer I receive. Come, then, Brigand, be my Guide,
and my own familiar friend. Bring your Bugle and be blowed to it.
The Brigand, followed by the Second Brigand, also mounted, trots
behind our car. The. three other cobs are left, in the lane, to the
care of a third and younger Brigand—Brigand Junior—while a
fourth Brigand, of a still lighter complexion—(I notice they become
fairer as they get younger-^-or rather I should say they grow darker
as they get older—and this connection between hair and villainy
might form a subject for some future chapter in Typical Develop-
ments, Vol. X.—only that my Brigands are not villains—quite the
contrary}—follows us on foot.
Our party at present consists of the Driver on one side of the ear,
myself on the other ; while "in our wake like any servants follow
also the bold " Brigands, two mounted,—our Cavalry Brigands,—and
one Fantassin, or Running foot Brigand.
Why does Brigand Number One, I ask myself, wear this battered
coppery-looking IJugle? I get my answer (from myself), " Because
he is the leader of the band. The others, however, I observe, have
no instruments.
Wild and weird becomes the scenery, and the east wind blows at
me "like," as BISHOP'S Glee has it, "infant charitee—ee—ee,
li—i—i—ke in—fant cha-ritee."
Well, uprouse ye then, ye merry, merry men (the Brigands), for
'tis your opening day. And it is, to put it theatrically, the first day
of a new tourist.
How they bound forth to meet me! how glad they are to see me!!
the Beggars.
Here is a whole party of them at KATE KEARNEY'S Cottage, and,
bless me! here's AATE KEABNEY'S great-great-granddaughter, with
a jug of something in the one hand and a glass in the other. She is
preparing a libation to the Angel Tourist myself. But the Angel
Tourist has luckily seen the KEARNEY family from afar off, and has
said to the Bugling Brigand and the Carman, "Gentlemen both,
I mind me that things are come to a pretty mountain pass indeed,
when an innocent, unoffending, peaceable Tourist cannot go two steps
without being assailed by these lawless nomads" (the Bugler bows,
and from this moment I believe the word "nomad" to be genuine Irish
—and I had been talking it without knowing it! Wonderful!).
"Nowto you my Guide and familiar friend, and to you my Charioteer"
(Carman delighted), "I say this much,—I will give ye both largesse,
mark me. largesse, if you—both of you, for yourselves and each
other, and for your heirs and assigns for ever—undertake to keep
far from me this ragamuffin horde of rascally beggars."
They swear emphatically and solemnly, by all they hold most
sacred, that, for a consideration, they will do my behest to the be-
hest, I mean the best, of their powers.
En avant.' I cry, and we dare the dangers of KATE KEARNEY'S
Cottage. Oh, did I ever hear of KATE KEARNEY? Yes; but not of
KATE REABNEY'S great-great-granddaughter. Poor old KATE! I
don't believe youTe any relation to the original, and maybe, old
Lady, your name isn't KEARNEY at all. I will not swallow all you
choose to tell me, and I distinctly refuse to swallow that yellow sort
of hair-oil in that bottle which you are pleased to call "potheen."
No, thank you, Ma'am, not if I know it.
"Divil a dhrop o' potheen is it at all at all," myCarman whispers
to me, confidentially, as we drive on quickly. We are hand and
glove now.
"Grrr—wrikra—grrr, Colleen," says the Brigand Bugler, in
good round-in-the-mouth Irish, to a very plain, elderly Lady with
bare legs, who insists on pressing her attentions on me.
She stares. Can she Ibelieve her ears? No; for she is at me
again. The Brigand Bugler advises her to "be off," in such gut-
turals as moke my hair stand on end, and which are sufficiently
forcible to stagger the Colleen, who has one more shot at me with a
photograph of herself at forty, i.e. about ten years ago, and then,
seeing my Bugler's determined aspect, she vanishes despairingly;
not, However, without hurling just a trifle of good Celtic (in ques-
tionable taste as coming from a Lady's mouth. I should say, even
though she had bare feet and unkempt locks), directed at our party
generally, but specially at the Bugler's head, whereat my brave
followers laugh.
Ha! ha! What care we for the ban of the Mountain Witch? Do
we blench at a Crone's Curse!! Never!
(Happy 2Vw?M$rW.—What a title for a Christmas Book—a real,
genuine fireside, cheerful style of story, with startling illustrations.
—The Crone's Curse! Must write to POPWOOD AND GHOOLLY, and
ask 'em if they '11 have it for their Annual, just to hit that publica-
tion up a little.)
Now, my boys. En avant, as I said before.
More beggars—swarms of them. They waylay us; they come by
short cuts, over peat bogs, over rocky ground, for miles they come.
The old Lady—the Colleen with the photograph—hides—dodges me—
comes up suddenly when least expected; and, when (oh! the wicked
old slyboots!) a turn of the road and a huge boulder have hidden me
from my brave companions. "No, no," 1 say; "I don't want your
photographs. Avaunt! Here! Hi! An secours! _ A mot/

begori—no, I don't know any Irish, except "Grammachree ma Cruiskeen

sion.'
Ha! BLUCHEH is coming to the rescue—I mean the Bugler. Like the French
at Waterloo, at the sight of the Prussians, the Colleen turns and Hies. I shut
up my telescope. Up, Guards, and at 'em! The Bugler and his Fantassin send
Hying a score of urchin beggars, and for a while we are left in peace and quiet.
"Tell them nest time," I say to BLUCHER. "Tell them that there is a
large party of Tourists coming up a long way behind us."
Is this an Albauna? A white one? 'Tis not a black one certainly. For
behind us, i.e., to-morrow, or next week, or this day twelve months, will
assuredly come a large body of Tourists. And is not all fair in war? Am I not
in a mountain pass with beggars lying in ambush on every side? Shall I be
robbed and bothered?
My Carman quits me. His vehicle is of no further use. I have to mount
the bag-o'-bones which the Second Brigand hath till now bestrode.
Will he not tumble? I ask. He will not, is the positive answer.
I mount. In my long grey Ulster, and my much-enduring, pliant wideawake,
with the Guides following afoot, and the mounted Bugler by my side, and
the wild scenery round about us, I remind myself of some picture I have seen
(DELABOCHE'S perhaps) of " Napoleon Crossing the Alps."
Now come the Echoes. The Bugler is off his horse and performing a solo.
Such a solo! 0 MISTER LEVY I 0 shade of KXENIG! 0 my ears! There
is the Bugler giving himself a blow out—^uch a blow out! He is becoming
as purple as the heather; he is swelling visibly. He has awoke the Echoes!
Awoke 'em.' Heavens! the Echoes must be a fearfully heavy-sleeping family,
if they 're not aroused by this infernal row.
And how they get up, one after another, these Echoes!
Nymph Echo Number One jumps up a little confused. She seems to be
shaking her head and crying out, ' Hufloa! What's that ?—Is anybody ill?
Is KATE KEARNEY'S Kottage on fire? What is itP"
Echoes Number Two and Three sound as if a German Band had all jumped
out of bed suddenly, had rushed at their instruments, and played a discord
madly.
Then the Echo gets clearer, and the last of all is the best, sounding like
sweet church-bells far away down in the distant valley. That, my Bugler, was
worth hearing.
So onward. But they won't let the Echoes alone. A
man comes forward, with a small cannon, and takes a
cool deliberate shot at an Echo. Bang! There's an
Echo flying away! There's another! A third gets off
safely! A fourth is winged, and a fifth is hit very hard,
I should say, judging from its faint cry; while a sixth,
which was just within ear-shot, dies away down in the
valley! What a day's sport we are having! What a
bag of Echoes! And—hit or miss—I have to pay six-
pence apiece for them.
Will I not take a drop of the crater at the Col-
leen Bourn's Cottage?
Well, my good Lady, give me a glass of your goat's
milk, and put in it just the laste taste in life of potheen.
Be it what it may, the drink is excellent and re-
freshing. Blessye, Colleen Bawn—I beg your pardon,
Mrs. Hardress Cregan I should say—bless you, and the
little Cregans, and all the other little kids I see browsing
on the hill-side. By the way, there never was such a
place for goats and kids as hereabouts. They swarm.
Towards the Black Valley (a magnificent sight, and
worth the whole day's excursion) we come upon a School-
house in the mountains. Evidently for the kidt.
So we descend. How beautiful! how lovely! We
are, I think, a good three miles or more from where we
first entered by KATE KEARNEY'S Cottage. My Busier
and the Second Brigand are stopping behind to effect
some financial arrangements on a satisfactory basis with
the last Cannon-firer.
I am, thank heaven, alone! sitting calmly and pen-
sively on my horse, looking at the Black Valley—the
Valley Umbree Mortis. Ah! let me enjoy such a scene
undisturbed! 0 Solitude where are thy charms? Here,
where there seems to be a sourdine accompaniment of
the most pianissimo music played by insect musicians.

your poor Colleen's sake, Sorr," says a foggy potheenish
voice, just below me, at my saddle-bow.
I look. down. Heavens! it's that disreputable old
Colleen Bawn again! She must have taken short cuts
and tracked us all along the valley for three miles! For
here she is. She clings to my coat! In despair she
implores me, "Sorr, Sorr. ye '11 buy the poor Colleen's
fottygruph—your poor Colleen's."
No, I *m if I do.
Au secours.' Hi.' d moi! And I raise the very

Once more BLUCHEH the Bugler appears. With a yell
of despair and an expiring Blessing in Irish she gives up
the game, and disappears behind a rock—and for aught
I know down through a trap-door into the Gnomes'
Kitchen.
Happy Thought.—What a stage this would be for the
Incantation Scene in Der Freischiitz.
But really, if there must be a Colleen Baien (who has
no connection whatever with Killarney, except by a
legendary link) and a Kate Kearney, and a blina fiddler
(who is the only honest old soul among them—poor
man! he's been "dark" for years), and cannons, and
buglers, and pipers, and boats, and beggars, <7 hoc genus

been accustomed to getting up Grand Operas and Panto-
mimes, let us have the thing done really well, with a good
out-of-door Ballet troupe, a charming Kate Kearney
(with a song), and at the Colleen Bawn's Cottage let us
have a set of wax-work figures, with Father Tom and
the Colleen, and Hardress, and Myles-na-Coppaleen,
while a barrel-organ, hidden away somewhere behind
the "arras" (which is also Irish, I believe, for wain-
scot), should discourse the " Cruiskeen Lawn."
At the entrance of the Glen there should be a wicket,
as at Black Gang Chine, and a staff of civil check ana
money-takers. One payment should include everything'
from one end of the Glen to the other, and no fresh
ticket be required until the Tourist reaches the Lake
and meets the boatmen.
Now that's my idea for the Gap of Dunloe. Of course
the prices should be " done low" as possible, for the sake
of the name.
As for the Lakes, divided like a "Fifth Form" into
Upper, Lower, and Middle, what can I add to all that
has been already written about them? Nothing,—

CURIOUS AWARDS.
THE Philadelphia Exhibition
Awards to Exhibitors from Great
Britain and Ireland, as published
last week in the Times, will well
repay a little careful investigation.
Let us address ourselves to the
task, without any selfish con-
siderations as to the endowment
which may reward our research.
A stumbling-block lies right
across the threshold ofourinquiry.
What are " Dyed Silesias"? The
Office will remain open till a late
hour this evening, for the accom-
modation of those favoured ex-
perts who may be disposed to pall
and give the required information.
"Cotton Gin." We disseminate
the announcement of this Award
with'some doubt and mistrust, not
unmingled with a feeling of regret
at the action of the United States
in this particular instance; seem-
ing, as it does to us, to be tanta-
mount to giving a premium to
intemperance. (Is " Cotton Gin"
a sort of "Shrub"?)
"Pleasure Carriages." In the
absence of more precise informa-
tion as to what these Carriages
are, we can only venture pretty
confidently to assert what they are not—they are not.Omnihnsea, or
Four-Wheeled Cabs, or Third-Class Railway Compartments.
"Middlings." At first this seemed utterly incomprehensible,
an impenetrable mystery, baffling conjecture, and defeating sur-
mise. But a little reflection reminded us that history is not without
examples of honours, awards, distinctions, prizes, and emoluments,
falling to middling, very middling, individuals, and things. For
instance, there are some very middling statues in our own Metro-
polis, to which first premiums have been awarded; and it is within
the memory of many persons now living that Cabinets have con-
tained some very middling Statesmen. Is it possible, therefore,
that at Philadelphia some middling articles may have slipped into
a better place than they actually deserve?
"Mustard Plasters," &c. Our private advices assure us that the
competition in this class was very keen, and that the heroic Judges,
resolutely bent on testing the merits of the various Plasters by
personal application, went through untold suffering before they
could conscientiously award the palm of victory.
"Automatic Stoker." Strange to say, the mechanical engine-
driver and the wonderful clock-work guard are not even mentioned.
Perhaps they are reserved for the Supplementary List.
"Job Printing-Press." Some evils we know must always exist
—such as mosquitoes, marriages for money, indifferently cooked
potatoes, taxes, duns, and jobs. Let us therefore be thankful that,
as regards jobs at least, there are special Printing-Presses to make
their existence known and give them publicity, and so aid in dimi-
nishing their occurrence and thwarting their operation.
"Dental Porcelain." We conclude this is an elegant euphemism
for false teeth. A tribute of admiration is due to the self-sacrifice
and patriotism of those Judges who submitted their gums to the
necessary, experiments.
"Blarney Tweeds." Highly recommended as very suitable for
those members of Society wno are called upon to make complimen-
tary speeches, election addresses, and parliamentary harangues.
Indispensable also to persons of both sexes engaged in the composi-
tion of love letters. (It is almost superfluous to add that these
articles are of Irish manufacture.)
"Lastings." Many will be the guesses hazarded as to what these
articles may be. As proprietors of a few little boys and girls, we can
but hope they are boots and shoes, and articles of wearing apparel.
"Special Award. Irish Setter Bitch." Great jealousy on the
part of the English Bull-dog and the Scotch Terrier.
N.B.—Of all the successful firms, not one takes our fancy so much
as "YOUNO AND STBONO." We shall be glad to negotiate with these
gentlemen if they have a vacancy in their house for a nice well-
disposed youth, who could be taken in without the formality of a
premium, and who might look forward in a few years' time to a
share in the business.
INCOME-TAX HETUBNS.—Does it? Not if the Commissioners are
aware of it.
SOUTH-SHIELDS SWOKDSMEN.
"The tongue is a sharp sword."
How excellent a thing is urbanity in those who ait in the seat of
Council! And how valuable the function of the local reporter who
daily or weekly gives to the little world of his own city or town the
utterances of its municipal wisdom. The more literally this is done
no doubt the better on the whole; even if the result may sometimes
be startling. Some municipal worthies, not satisfied with calling:
spades spades, will insist on putting upon their spades an edge of
very sharp and strong language. Thus in the report of a recent
Council Meeting at South Shields, we read—d propos of a question
about the renting of a llato Collector'*, office:—
"ALDERMAN DALE considered it was only right that MR. ELLIOTT should
have an office.
"MR. YOUNO: It is really too bad; it'i a piece of d d impertinence.
(Sensation and' Order !')
"In reply to a question by Mu. MABANB, he was informed that the furni-
ture for the office was ordered.
"MR. MABAWE: Then I will press my Amendment the stronger.
"The Vote was then taken, when there were for the Amendment, 9;
against it, 11. Tbe Amendment was declared lost, and the original Motion
nirried.
"MR. TOUNO: Then I will move another Amendment, that the men who
ordered the furniture pay for it.
"ALDERMAN GLOVER: The Motion has been put and carried, and the
subject has been settled.
"MK. YOUNO: I say it has not been settled; it is not true.
"ALDERMAN GLOVEII: Sit down. Sir!
"MR. YOUNQ: No I won't; I will see you d d first. (Senittion, and
'Order!")
"ALDBRMAN OLOVEB: You have heard the expression made uie of by
COUNCILLOR Yooxo. It is neither the expression of a Gentleman nor a
Councillor, and I hope this Council will not permit it—('Hear, ktar !')—else
I shall certainly leave the Chair.
"ALIJEHMAN JAMES: MR. YDDNO should withdraw the expression.
"MR. E»6ii»B: I ask MR. YOUNO to withdraw that expression. There
i» no occasion for it.
"MR. YOUNQ: Well, I formally withdraw the expression, but I feel very
strongly, and
"ALDERMAN GLOVEII: You have apologised, and need not say any more.
"Mn. YOUNQ: But
"ALDERMAN GLOVER: Sit dowa, Sir!
"The subject was then dropped."
Perhaps the sooner ME. Yotriro is treated like the subject, the
better.
MB. MABA.NE, who figures in the above lively passage of arms,
was himself forced to appeal to the protection of the Deputy-Mayor
before the meeting was over. The question was as to a vote for the
School-Board expenses (on amendment of the amendment).
"MR. BOWMAN spoke against the amendment, and hoped that those who
voted for the one previous would stick to their colours, and not make fools of
themselves by voting in favour of the present amendment.
"ALDERMAN WILLIAMSON: Then you say that those persons who do not
agree with you are fools.
"MR. BOWMAN: I did not mean that; only that those persons who voted
before in a certain line should stick to their colours.
"The vote was then taken, when the voting was precisely the same as on
the previous occasion, and the amendment by MR. SCOTT was lost.
"MR. DONALD moved another amendment, that the estimate for the
School-Board be £3000.
"MR. YOUNO seconded the amendment.
"MR. MABANB protested, as being unfair, that after they had scored two
victories, a Gentleman, who had previously been neutral, should now rise up
and propose another amendment. It was unfair and ungentlemanly.
"ALDERMAN GLOVER: I must call you to order. It is improper to make
use of the word 'ungentlemanly.'
"MR. SCOTT: It is a very improper expression.
"ALDERMAN GLOVER: MR. MABANB must withdraw that remark.
"MR. MABANE: Well, for the sake of getting on, I will withdraw the
expression, but I atill hold to my opinion that it is unfair.
"The vote was then taken, when there were, for the amendment—13.
Against—10. The amendment was declared carried, and with this emenda-
tion the report of the Finance Committee was adopted.
"MR. MARANB: It is disgraceful.
"MR. SCOTT (to MR. MABANB): Go down to the schools and see for yourself.
"MR. MARANE: Everybody has not a brother there. (Laughter and
confusion.)
"After order had been somewhat restored, MR. MABANF. informed the
Deputy-Mayor that MR. SCOTT had called him a donkey—(laughter)—and
he hoped the Deputy-Mayor would make him withdraw the word.
"MR. SCOTT: I withdraw the ' donkey." (Loud laughter.)"
Will our readers do as MB. SCOTT did?
A CAPITA! ntOSl'ECT.
WE learn from the Posters that MBS. JoHif WOOD is about to
open the St. James's Theatre, with Three Millions of Money!
Evidently the Theatre will want no "Property Man."

TWO WORLDS-THE OLD AND THE NEW.

£ACE, in her Palace over the Atlantic,
From the New World deals her awards around
While war's leashed hounds, a-strain, for bloodshed Jrantic,
In our Old World can scarce be held in bound.
Lo! here, each Nation armed against its neighbour;
Cross in the face of Crescent reared for fair/it •
There, to the blessed battlefields of labour
United States that all the world invite.
For a far different shock from the impingings
Of broadsides 'twixt a Chesapeake and Shannon,
The strife of CORLISS and his monster engines,
With Cyclops KRUPP and Essen's monster cannon.
Happy young Titan, that between two oceans,
Thy guardian Atlantic and Pacific,
Growest apart from our Old World's commotions—
With room to spread, and space for powers prolific.
Wisely exchanging rifles, swords, and rammers,
For spades and ploughshares, axes, saws, and treadles,
Thou putt'st thy strength in engines and steam-hammers,
And thy gun-metal mouldest into medals.
Earth has no clime, no sky, but thou commandest:
Mo growth, but thy wide-spreading soil can bear:
No ore, but the rich ground on which thou standest, ,
Somewhere or other, bids thee stoop and share.
No height thou hast but all thy sons may reach;
No good, but all are free to reap its profit:
No truth, but all thy race may learn and teach,
No lie, but whoso lifts its mask may scoff it.
Oh happy in Ihy stars, still rising higher,
Happy e'en in thy stripes so lightly borne.
How far may thy meridian growth aspire,
That showest so majestic in thy morn't
To what height may not Heaven's high favour lead thee,
In cycle 01 the ages yet to be,
When these first hundred years of life have made thee,
For Arts and Strength, the Giant that we see!

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
An evening or two with PeuumBxr—Something about a Hall, and
a new Theatre; al»o a report on the St. James's and the
Strand Entertainments, and a midnight mysterious meeting to
Jinish with.
SIR,—Don't tell me (you never did, but you might) that adver-
tising ig of little value. Don't tell me that good wine needs no
bush: good wine needs a bush as much as does the indigenous South
African. But what I am coming to (and what I hope I am going to,
one of these festive nights), is this, how should Canterbury Hall ever
have entered into my head, but through an advertisement meeting
my eyes P My dear old Mahommedan friend, PEOQTJL BET (this, he
says, is the correct method of spelling his name, and not as I wrote
it a fortnight ago), was dining with me the other evening, and
talking over various important subjects connected with the new
loan which he is proposing to bring out at sixteen per cent. Well,
Sir, the illustrious Bulbul of Stamboul is attempting to convert
certain Turkish securities into something negotiable, and I am doing
my best to convert the illustrious Bulbul. I am trying to induce
him to see the error of his Mahommedan ways, and he has got so
far .is to take kindly to what he waggishly calls the "Sublime
Port" (mine is a fine old crusted '3i wine, which I don't drink my-
self), which he sips with his walnuts, just like a Christian. On
this occasion the Bulbul had been reading the ARCHBISHOP OF
CAWTEBJIUKT'S recent charge, and was so highly indignant, that, on
my proposing to him to go to the Canterbury Hall, he flatly and
peremptorily refused, on purelv theological grounds.
"No!" exclaimed the Bulbul. "Bechesm, on my dear eyes be it!"
He was once a Commodore in the Turkish Navy, which excuses what
would otherwise have been a rather strong expression, "Which
isn't swearing," he went on to explain, speaking more in sorrow
than in anger; "but I will not put one penny into the Arch-
bishop's pocket by entering his Hall."
I explained that it was not a Hall by the See of Canterbury, but
the irate Bulbul wouldn't hear of it. He finished the bottle,
pocketed the remaining walnuts and the crackers (which he keeps
under his pillow, so as, if he wakes up in the night, and wishes to
say something droll, he may have a companion by his pillow-side to
crack a joke with,—an Oriental custom), and, saying "Allah il
Allah!" he went to bed,—or, to describe the proceeding in
excellent French, and to make an international jeu de mot, "Allah
il Allah.'" s'ecria-t-il, "Allah il Allah.'" et IL ALLA se coucher.
This is one of those jeux de mots which are registered for transmis-
sion abroad, and warranted to keep in any climate. Allowance made
to shippers and skippers.
The next night 1 read the advertisement aloud to my Oriental
friend.
"You will see," I said, giving him the cream of the extracts,
"that the ' startling feature ' is A Sliding Hoof."
"I don't rink," replied PEGGTTL BEY, "and I don't slide ; though,"
he added, thoughtfully, "if I went on a roof in this country, I pro-
bably should. However," he continued carelessly, "let it slide.
Go on!"
Heedless of the interruption, I continued my selection of attrac-
tions from the advertisement in the Era. "You will enter through.
'Romantic carerns, overlooking mountain and vale.' Fancy that,
my Bey, in the vicinity of the New Cut and what Mrs. Brown calls
'QUEEN VICTORIA'S own Theavter!'"
"Are there Houris ?" asked PEGGUL, with a sly look over the rim
of his glass.
"There is, I see advertised, a Premiere Danseuso Assoluto," I
returned, gravely.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Turbaned Turk misunderstood me. Chucking up his fez, he
exclaimed, "By the Beard of the Prophet! Imaun! We will go
and see this Danseitse Dissoluta .'"
I was shocked. I reminded him that he was being converted,
and, as a threat, I protested I would t;ike him to see lilite Heard at
the Folly Theatre, if he didn't behave himself. He trembled.
"Xo, no!" he exclaimed, piteously; "anything but that."
Presently recovering himself, that is replacing the fe/ on his head,
he asked, " Whv have they changed the name of the Charing Cross
Theatre to The Folly?"
"The Manager," I answered, "explains in a handbill that it is
because he intends ' shooting Folly as it Hies.'"
"What's Folly done to his Company that they should murder
her? If he only wounds Folly, she will, of course, cease to lly, and
be usable t'> run."
"True, i'EGGur,. But when he takes aim, he hopes to makeahit."
"But," returned the Mahommetan, astutely, " I see that a piece,
founded on Martin Chtizzletcit, and called Pecksniff, is to be pro-
duced. Does the Manager, ME. ALEXANDER HENDEBSON, call this
• shooting Folly as it flies'?"
"Sir," I replied, drawing myself up, as if I were a legal document,
'' these are questions which only a Sage can answer. I am not
DIOOEWK."
"Nor ALEXANDER," said the Bey, flippantly.
So we dropped the subject, nnd wont to the St. James's to see
Three MtUi<nis .;/' Miim-y, with Mis. Joior WOOD and MB. GEOBGE
tfoNEY in tin' two principal parts.
ME. Hoirjcr always was funny in Money, and of course it was not
to be ejKpecttd that his humour would be limited by the exact
•ium having been named. I never saw the French original, Les
Troit Uttlii/ns de Glm/iatcur, but if there is not more in it than
these We adapt >.TS have got out of it, it cannot have been, originally,
a rexy tamorous production. It is always pleasant to witness MBS.
WOOD'S performance, she seems so thoroughly to enjoy the fun
whenever it occurs, and whatever SUITES Tin- Tlirn- Millions may
obtain with the Million, it will be owing to the acting, for there is
v«ry liUie to laugh at in the dialogue. MB. GEOBGE CLABJCE'S
American milliunnaire must be taken, I presume,—as a truthful
representation of the reality. I never met the reality, and so,
though "I may prcsump as much as I darned please," I could
not presump to criticise this particular delineation of character;
but I do presump, that, had the adaptation been made by the
experienced MB. MADDISON MOBTON, the dialogue would probably
have been as amusing as that in Woodcock's Little Game.
PEGGTTL BET was highly pleased with the mock Italian duett
between MRS. WOOD and MR. HONEY, though he expressed himself
in excellent monosyllabic Turkish on the merits of the piece
generally.
"Give me more music!" he exclaimed, and so I took him to hear
Toto, at the Strand.
For charming scenery, for bright dresses, and for brilliancy
generally, apart from music and libretto, Princess Toto is, I fancy,
unsurpassed in London at the present moment. It commences well,
it promises well, but it is disappointingly childish. It revives hope
now and then by an occasional flicker. For instance, the business of
the scene with the Indians (MESSRS. Cox and PENLEY being capital
in this) is immensely funny, as is also the situation where Prince
Doro (M. MAEIUS) hits upon the expedient of providing the
monotonously forgetful Princess with his visiting-cards, so that she
may remember his name during their love-making. The whole plot
seems to me to be a development of the idea suggested by that first-
rate comic song (written, I think, by the librettist and composer of
this comic opera, and sung in one of the GEBMAN-REED pieces at the
Gallery of Illustration), where the oblivious lover would propose if
he could only think of the Lady's name, which he at last remembers
is "MARIA," but too late—for she is another's. The germ of Toto
was in this song, while the notion of persons being obliged to assume
characters quite alien from their real natures, may be found in the
same author's Creatures of Impulse and Jliippy Arcadia. There is
not in Toto such a song as Mn. CLAY'S "Nobody Knows" or some-
bodyelse's " You are a very Handsome Man," in both of which Miss
SAJTTLEY made "big hits" at the Alhambra. Perhaps that kind
of music was considered too "Music-Hally" for Comic opera,—only
isn't this Toto more of the Bnuffe than the Comic Opera? Isn't the
hook more suitable for a setting by OFFENBACH than by AT/BEE?
and wouldn't something like " Nobody Knows" score a success with
the habitues of the Strand Theatre, who do like to be enlivened
occasionally with a vulgarian atrocity?
Ma. Cox s makes-up, first as King Portico, and then as the Indian
Chief, are admirable, and the burlesque imitation of Hiaicatha
couldn't be improved, either by the author, who has evidently
written it in his happiest vein, or by the actor, MK. PENLEY, whose
delivery of the lines was so inimitably funny as (when Your Repre-
sentative was there) nearly to obtain an encore. It is not often
that a speech in an Opera is singled out for such a distinction.
"Allah il Allah!" said PEOGUL BEY, as he lit his fragrant
minaret, a kind of Turkish cigar, chiefly paper. "WAGNER, with
his Flying Dustman, hath nought to fear from these Boshi-
Bazouks."
He was melancholy, and needed a something that cheers but does
not inebriate. When I allow him to indulge in anything that does
inebriate, the Bey, though generally so smooth and tranquil,
j becomes most unpleasantly Bosphorus—I mean, boisterous.
"Christian Dog!" he exclaimed, addressing me,—it sounds insult-
i ing, but it isn't, being merely the Turkish equivalent for " Sly dog,"
| " Jolly dog," and suchlike familiarities, which neither breed, nor
.imply contempt—" Christian dog! lam athirst! I am hungry!
Iin-pale-ale me! Lead me to the Steak!"
"Bulbul," I replied, in excellent Turkish, " Im-aun!"
And so,—" Yes, tee together"—as the duett in Norma has it—
sought the Cavern of the Good Genii of the Silver Gridiron, where
Grim Goblings do nightly congregate, and midnight poachers gloat
o'er their golden eggs. Hush! Give the pass-word! Now the
counter-sign! Now the grip! Xow the secret order, for the Waiter
is in the room! I la! there are two down on their marrow-bones!
Nay, then, resistance is useless! To the rescue ....
Excuse my finishing thus hurriedly, but I see that GKNEBAL GORG r-
BUSTEB and the two O'BEDIJJKS have just entered, and in another
minute there will be very little left for the faithful, but famishing,
individual, who signs himself now as ever
YOUK litTEEgESTATITE.
P.S.—The Bulbul, who in the process of conversion it deeply
interested in all ecclesiastical questions, wants to know if there is
such a dignitary as the " Bishop of Soda and Bee." I seem to have
heard the name somewhere. Also hasn't my Mahommedan friend
got things a trifle muddled in asking, "When there's a Church
question for the Spirituous Peers, doesn't a Jorum of Bishops decide
it'{ How many make a jorum?" And again, " How do you make
a real Bishop 'f Do you use more than two lemons, and ought there
to be any Curate-so in it or not?" I fancy the Bulbul has either
got out of his depth, or has found an old recipe book of drinks.

A True Economist.
WHO says " The Wise Men" came from the East? It was from
the North, depend upon it. Hark to this far-sighted wisdom of a
Baillie of the gude town of Elgin:—
"BAILLIE ALLAN said he was of opinion that it would be money thrown
away to repair the engine. There had been no fire in Elgin for some fifteen
years, nnd, if one should ocour, the best way to deal with it would be by way
of using buckets and such like means. A tire-engine was a mere piece of
nonsense. The question of having one had come up before the Commissioners
three or four times while he had been a member of the body. It had always
come to nothing, and it would do so again."

THE PUBLIC ORATOR.
THE University of Cambridge has lately been electing; a new
Public Orator. Much curiosity having been aroused as to this
functionary, we have made it our special business to inquire into
his duties, qualifications, privileges, perquisites, and emoluments,
and now hasten to lay the result of the investigation before our
impatient Readers.
The Public Orator is expected to know by heart the works of
DEMOSTHENES, ISOCBYTES, CICERO, QUINTILIAN, BUBKE. Pm, Fox,
SHERIDAN, CUBBAN, GRATTAN, DANIEL WEBSTEB, and LOBD CHES-
TERFIELD.
The Public Orator must be prepared to respond in Greek, Latin,
or Hebrew, to the toast of The University" at any dinner,
luncheon, or other public entertainment, connected with the Free-
masons, the Odd Fellows, the Volunteers, the School-Board, or the
Philosophical Society.
It is the duty of the Public Orator to give lectures in Elocution,
and to hold classes for instruction in the art of Reading, the delivery
of public Recitations, and the management of the voice in the Pulpit,
at the Bar, in Parliament, and at Congresses.
It is also the duty of the Public Orator to attend the debates at
the Union, to applaud those speakers whom he may consider deserving
of encouragement, and to express, by audible tokens of dissent, his
dissatisfaction at any defects in style, diction, manner, gesture, and
action.
That the Public Orator may keep himself thoroughly well ac-
quainted with the best examples of modern eloquence, it is his
privilege to be present, either in the House of Lords or Commons, at
least one night in every week during the Session; and when any
debate of especial interest is expected to arise, he must make
arrangements to remain within an easy distance of Westminster
until its close.
Once at least during his University career, every Undergraduate
is entitled, on payment of a fee of one guinea, to request an inter-
view w_ith the Public Orator, and to call upon him to listen to a
recitation from the works of one of the great Orators or Dramatists
of ancient or modern times, or to an extempore address on the
Sewage Question, or some other prominent topic of the day.
The Public Orator presents all candidates for degrees from extra-
ordinary D.C.L.'s to ordinary B.A.'s, and acquaints the Vice-Chan-
cellor and the Proctors with every particular of their previous lives
in the choicest Latin and the best superlatives.
Once in each term the Public lOrator delivers an address in the
Senate House, or other commodious public building, on the principal
occurrences of the time, whether 01 local or national interest, first
in Latin to those who are in statu pupillari, and then in English for
the benefit of the ladies, who on the conclusion of his speech shower
their bouquets at his feet and wreathe his cap with garlands. At the
annual Commencement he recapitulates theliistory of the past year,
either in prose or verse, and a collection for his benefit is made at the
close of the proceedings by the Pro-proctors and Esquire Bedels.
It is the privilege of the Public Orator to receive an invitation to
the wedding-breakfast of the daughter, grand-daughter, or niece of
any of the Heads of Houses or Professors, and to return thanks on
behalf of the Bridesmaids, in his ex-officio capacity.
If a daughter of the yice-Chancellor for the time being receives a
proposal of marriage, it is the Public Orator who composes her
answer in elegant Latin, and on gilt-edged paper.
A suitable residence, with spacious grounds, m which he may pace
up and down when preparing his public exercises, is provided for
the Public Orator, rent and taxes free; with coals, candles, gas, and
firewood, at the expense of the University. The house is known as
"The Oratory."
The Public Orator is paid by results; that is to say, according to
the number of speeches he makes in the course of the year.
There can be no difficulty in distinguishing the Public Orator, as
he invariably wears a violet velvet robe, with blue silk sleeves, on
which are embroidered in gold the monograms of 4tDemotthenes and
Cicero.

HARD LINES FOR HERETICS.
(A Pastoral, done into doggerel, and dedicated to the BISHOP OF MINORCA.)
"WE renew and we
repeat this
our excom-
munication
'Gainst Heretics
of every sect,
and each de-
nomination,
Their adopted
children, pupils,
every soul that
sits at meat with
'em;
Their fathers,
mothers, tutors;
all who deal
with 'em or
treat with 'em.
We hereby excom-
municate all
those who've a
kind look for
e'm,
Their helpers and
their servants;
all who wait on
'em or cook for
'em.
All those thatjdare to Heretics to let a habitation,
School, Hospital, or Church, we doom to excommunication.
And we "hereby sentence each'and all that, despite our prohibition,
Give Protestants, or lend, or leave, them money, to perdition;
And also all with Heretics who live on terms of amity,
Or speak or write a word for them in trouble and calamity.
Oor Clergy, in the Mass whilst they perform their holy functions,
We charge throughout our diocese to read out these injunctions
On three successive Sundays—day and deed alike the better—
And make their flocks by acts of faith obey them to the letter.

FICTION IN THE PULPIT.
In; the days before Music Halls, there were Supper-Rooms, also
musical, at one of which, once, was wont nightly to be sung by a
comic vocalist, a song with the chorus:—
"No science to me is a mystery,
I've read every book through and through.
I was always the fondest of 'istory,
Because we all know it is true."
As, for example :—
"JULIUS C.USAR invented gunpowder—"
And so on; with similar illustrations of historical truth. To
which might now be added a duly versified extract from a political
discourse in the form of a sermon, reported to have been preached
by an Eminent Personage in a chapel on Friday last week, being
the feast of St. Edward the Confessor. "That great mass of cor-
ruption, the Roman Empire," having begun, said His Eminence,." to
die by its own law of dissolution ":—
"At last a Roman Emperor—CONSTANTIXE—embraced Christianity, and no
sooner had he been converted to the faith than he translated his throne to
Byzantium, which became Constantinople, because his instinct told him he
could not reign supreme in the city where the Vicar of Jesus Christ dwelt.
The sovereignty of this world then gave place to the sovereignty of the Incar-
nate Word, and from that day onwards Christian civilisation spread from
Rome as its centre. In the person of the Vicar of Christ the two offices of
Pontiff and King were united, and, because united in him, they were separated
in all others who bore authority."
Suppose any student at the College in course of formation, under
the auspices of CABDINAL MANNING, at Kensington, goes up to pass
an examination in history, conducted by any commonly competent
examiner. Should he be asked to name the time at which the
Popes acquired temporal sovereignty, would the Cardinal, to whom
the foregoing statements are ascribed, recommend him to assign the
date at which CONSTANTINE " translated his throne to Byzantium,"
and turned that city into Constantinople? Would he advise him to
back this answer by alleging certain Forged Decretals," so called,
to have been genuine documents, and the commonly accounted ficti-
tious " Donation of CossTANTiNE " an actual transaction? If not,
ought not the Cardinal, on consideration, candidly to acknowledge
that the historical views propounded in the last of the above quota-
tions exactly resemble those referred to in the first of them, and
exemplified in the second? The sole difference is inessential, being
no more than that between secular and ecclesiastical history, and
the latter, he also might sing, is as estimable as the former, "because
we all know it is true." Only, instead of singing to that effect on a
Music Hall stage, he says as much in a Pulpit. There, it is won-
derful what a man of undoubted knowledge, and of veracity under
less exalted conditions equally unquestionable, will occasionally
work himself up to affirming, in a night of faith and fancy. It
seems all the more wonderful that CARDINAL MANNING should some-
times run on in that way, seeing that he is a strict Teetotaller.
A MODEL MAIDEN.
rfis not alone that she is fair,
And hath a wealth of golden hair;
'Tis not that she can play and sing,
To charm a Critic or a King;
Tis not that she is gentle, kind,
And wears no chignon huge

Nor high-heeled boot, nor corset
laced
To show her slenderness of waist;
'Tis not that she can talk with
ease
On well-nigh any theme you
please;
'Tis is not that she can row, and
ride,
And do a dozen things beside :-
The reasons why [L lore Miss

Are that she never wears a frown,
Ne'er sulks, or pouts, or mopes,
or frets,
Or fusses about "styles" or
"sets;"
Ne'er nurses Lapdogs by the fire,
Nor bids her friends their charms
admire;
Ne'er bets upon the Derby Day,
And when she's lost omits to pay;
By bonnets does not bound her talk,
And is not indisposed to walk;
Ne'er bullies her small brothers, nor
Esteems their childish games a bore:
With pigments ne'er her cheek defiles,
Nor practises coquettish wiles:
Needs not a Maid to pack her things,
Nor plagues Papa for diamond rings:
On biscuits is content to lunch;
Loves SHAKSPEAKE, MILTON, POPE, and Punch:
Never descends to vulgar slang,
And ne'er was known the door to bang!

Strike in the Fainting Trade.
WE are sorry to report that all the Journeymen Painters in the
service of the eminent Coachbuilders, MESSKS. PANNELL & Co., have
struck work. The reason alleged for this proceeding on the part of the
men is not any quarrel about wages, but the fact that MB. PANNELL ,
Senior, having consented to sit for his portrait, has commissioned the
President of the Royal Academy instead of employing one of his own
painters. This naturally wounds the self-respect of his men.

THE ENCHANTED OMXIBL'S.
of the most curious tricks to be met with in
London is that of "The Enchanted Omnibus." It
might, perhaps, have been attributed to the Spirits, the
Conductor acting as Medium, but that such a hypothesis
has been negatived by the ioint action of a gentleman
named NETTLEFOLD and ALDERMAN SIR ROBERT GARDEN,
who have exposed the modus operandi, which appears to
be as follows :—
An Omnibus starts, say from Bayswater, and several
weak-minded and credulous persons are made to believe
before entering the vehicle that they have distinctly
read the words, " To London Bridge Railway " on the
exterior. On arriving at the Mansion House, however,
they are asked to alight, and read again, when, instead
of "To London Bridge Railway," the words, "Royal
Exchange, Mansion House, Bank," appear. The astonish-
ment of the passengers is, of course, unbounded.
MR. XETTLEFOLD was so astounded that he determined
at once to unravel the mystery, and consulted SIR
ROBERT GARDEN. These gentlemen did not think it
necessary to call in MESSRS. MASKKLTNE AND COOKE,
but, alter a patient investigation, discovered that the
trick is done by means of moveable boards painted on
both sides, which, while the happy passengers are
absorbed in conversation, or mutual congratulation on
the convenience of getting all the way to London Bridge
Railway for sixpence, the Conductor skilfully reverses.
It is something like a Pantomime trick, though
scarcely so amusing to the Passengers, or, when fined
ten shillings and costs, to the Conductor.
Cut, not Plucked.'
"AN OSTRICH-FARMER," home from the Cape, writes
to correct a misapprehension at the bottom of a late
lament of Mr. Punch's over the cruelty of Ostrich-
plucking. It seems that the eight months' crop of
feathers is not pulled out by the roots, but cut with
scissors. Punch loses no time in recording the correc-
tion, in justice to our Ostrich Farmers. He can under-
stand, as the feathers are "cut," that they should
"come again."

"Three thousand years hence, perhaps—if it be not within three hundred
or threescore years—the Art critics may utter sympathetic sighs over the rail-
way embankments and cuttings and viaducts which cross each other at every
conceivable level between Clapham Junction and the Great City, and contrast
those relics of the artistic ingenuity of the post with the tastelessly utilitarian
structures of their own age. Gazing on the long-rusted trusses and girders of
the colossal Midland Station at St. Pancras, the enormous spun of the Great
Eastern Terminus in Liverpool Street, the mouldering piers of the Charing
Cross Railway Bridge, the shattered parapets of the Thames Embankment,
and the decaying vestiges of the Holborn Viaduct, they may celebrate, in
terms of unmeasured eulogy, the grand and harmonious creations of the engi-
neers of the nineteenth century—men whom no natural obstacles could deter,
no scientific difficulties discourage, and the merest ruins of whose achieve-
ments were pregnant with matter for astonishment and applause, and with
models for imitation."—Daily Telegraph on MR. POYNTER'S Address befor*
the Social Science Congress at Liverpool.
RELIC of nobler days and noblest Arts,
Shattered yet splendid thy perspective spreads.
Graceful yet grand art thou in all thy parts,
To Art a model, and, to him who treads
Where rust thy sleepers in their clayey beds,
Her light shines through thy cuttings. Here indeed
The Iron Age with Ageless Beauty weds,
Divorced, defunct, in these grim days of greed,
When STEPHENSON and WATT in vain demand their meed.
AlasJ! no'more our feeble hands may rear
Grand and harmonious structures such as thL.
Upon yon rusty rail I drop a tear.
Twill rust it more! That age was great, I wis,
That could excogitate a girder! 'Tis
The finished fruit of Art's divinest function.
A Railway Bridge! Aha! (esthetic bliss!
We cannot ape, I own with sore compunction,
The charm of Charing Cross, the grace of Clapham Junction.
Ruin, yet what a ruin! From its mass
Many a Maori village might be.reared.
Oft as its mighty skeleton I pass,
I marvel how sublimely it appeared
When first its lonjf straight lines and vistas weird
Broke on the Briton's sight;—Oh happy day
For RUSKIN, to whose soul were so endeared
Those glittering glories whose bright sun nas set —
Permanent way and pier, platform and parapet!
Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime,—
Gaunt ruins, ye are great e'en in decay.
They had a taste in that far distant time,
Denied to us in this degenerate day.
Arch, girder, truss, vast sweep of roof,—the play
r Of Titan phantasy is in your all.
Yon pillars stir my spirit in a way
I have not felt in Karnac's vasty hall,
Or where thy ruins. Rome, are tottering to their fall
Arches on arches! Here proud Albion,
Collecting what was best of every line,
The charms of all her Stations merged in one;
Here Platform did with Terminus combine.
Here Railway minions, bearded, bland, benign,
Shouldered huge loads or wheeled the ladeu truck.
Ah! if their happy fortune had been mine,
To live ere Rauwaydom's last hour had struck,
Ere reigned balloons on high—alas! I 'd no such luck!

SIRLOIN AND LADY.
THE Women of England will scarcely, perhaps, consider the fol-
lowing emendation in the Times as any improvement of an—
"AMERICAN ERRATUM.—A New York paper, from which we recently
quoted a report of a speech of PROFESSOR HUXLEY, made in the United
States, represented him as stating; that English women had been described by
ii distinguished American as being rather too ' teethy;' the reader should
substitute 'beefy.'"
Whether 'it is prettier in Woman to be "beefy" or " teethy"
is a question which depends a good deal upon what "teethy"
may mean. It ;is too probable that the distinguished American
misreported to have called Englishwomen teethy, did not in-
tend to natter by calling them beefy. But the epithet is true
enough; not to say too true. What else than being beefy could be
expected of MBS. BULL, and her daughters, except those in their
nonage, whom perhaps the satirical rogue of a Yankee would rather
describe as vealy? Never mind, darlings. Beef is dear to every
true Briton. Let not the sneering stranger say, "So is his wife,
and so are his girls," meaning that his milliners' and jewellers' bills
usually equal, if they do not exceed his butchers'. It is in the
power of the Women of England, or, not to give offence to Scotch-
men, say Great Britain, to vindicate themselves from the aspersion
of being beefy in any but a laudatory sense, by learning to dress
themselves upon as nearly as possible the moderate cost of £15 a-
year, so as to take care that if they are in some degree beefy, as
their American critic terms them, at any rate their beef shall never
be objectionably overdone.

SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF SPIRITS.
THE Spirits of Spirit-Rappers, and Spirit-Writers, from the style
of their messages as published in the Spiritualist papers and
periodicals, appear almost all to have belonged to one class of
society, of which they still preserve the ideas and language. With
scarcely an exception they express themselves like persons of the
lower middle class. No Spirits ever affect the peculiar phraseology
of Swells, or even use that of educated gentlemen and ladies.
They usually talk as though their style had been derived from the
perusal of low newspapers, and from sitting under semi-taught
Dissenting Preacher?.
The names under which they announce themselves are chiefly the
familiar and endearing diminutives of common domestic life, such
as "AXLIE" and "KATLE" if female, otherwise the ordinary
Christian names JOHN, PETEK, and so on; though a few assume a
pompous pseudonym like "IMPERATOR," and not a few call them-
selves by ridiculous nicknames—for instance. " KIBOSH."
In short the Spirits, as a body, are intensely vulgar. Every Spirit
is a snob. His speech bewrayeth him. He is also a dullard. The
utterances of Spirits are generally platitudes of the broadest kind—
copy-book precepts diluted. A Spirit professing to he BENJAMIN
FHANKLI.V talks puray-a-lme. SITAKSFEAJIE, BACON, NEWTON,
BONAPARTE, BYKON, philosophers, poets, statesmen, sovereigns, all
of them invariably spell out the sentiments, in the idiom, of a
loquacious and conceited mechanic, or small tradesman. The
mighty dead are alw> very commonly apt to be facetious in a similar
homely vein; and their highest effusions correspond to the eloquence
of a temperance orator declaiming at a " Tea."
The truth appears to be that, whether or no the Spirits ever
impart messages in foreign or dead languages, in French, German,
Spanish, Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, their communications in the
vulgar tongue, not..to say in plain English, never rise above the
level of a mediocrity, which, without a pun, may he said to be that
of the Medium—though it comes nearer to (fnca than "aurea medio-
critas."

FANATICS AND FOOLS.
Hrs Holiness the POPE, the other day, receiving the Carlist
Pilgrims, led by the rampant ARCHBISHOP OF GBANADA, at the
Vatican, made, says the Times' Correspondent, a discourse "as
remarkable for its moderation as the address delivered to him by
that fiery Prelate was for its intemperance;" insomuch that—
"Never, perhaps, did the POPE employ fewer pious invectives than on this
occasion. He welcomed the Pilgrims, told them that he recognised them as
his children, and that they reminded him of the many martyrs whose blood
had made the soil of their country holy—the doctors, the confessors, the
founders of religious orders, and others, who through their virtues have con-
tributed to the greatness of Spain."
This explanation was of course not required by the faithful who
heard it. Nor could most other people have well misunderstood
whom the POPE meant by martyrs in Spain, even if he had not
described them as victims '' whose blood had made the soil of their
country holy." The Martyrs of the Inquisition bled very little.
Cremation before death was unattended with much if any bloodshed.
The Act of Faith, so called, can now be spoken of only in the
past tense—even in Turkey. But a British fanatic might have
subjected himself to it lately at Rome, if Home were what Rome
was, and is now no more. So much evidently appears from a further
statement by the authority above quoted:—
'As an instance of the strict impartiality observed by the Italian authori-
ties, I may mention that an English Dissenting Clergyman, officiating in
It-Mil", issued a placard to the effect that on Sunday last he would discourse
on the subject of' Papistical Pilgrimages and the Christian Pilgrimage.'"
The Italian Authorities did wisely in "sequestrating a poster
which might have been read by many as a provocation "—whence a
Fool might have got something ior himself, if not.so bad as fire and
Faggot, yet unpleasant enough, and richly merited. Suppose he had
been put under a pump, and subjected to punishment by the milder
element, who will say it would not have served him right? Are
Eanatical Pilgrims or fanatical Protestants the greater Asses?
Perhaps the Donkeys' ears are about of a length.
ANGLO-MOSLEM IRREGULARS.
IN publishing the statement below quoted from a column of
"Naval and Military Intelligence," was a contemporary hoaxed, or
flying a canard ?—
"A scheme in connection with the chances of a war with Russia has been
proposed, according to the Whitehall Gazette, and has met with what may be
termed conditional approval by the authorities at the War Office and the India
House. It is to call for Volunteer* in India to »erve in a cavalry contingent.
The rank and file of this force would be composed exclusively of Moslems, and
be commanded by officers who have served in the Indian irregular cavalry."
If this announcement is true, the authorities at the War Office
are apparently contemplating the creation of a new arm of the
Service, in the form of British Bashi-Bazouks. Should such a corps
be constituted to fight the Russians, may it not be feared that we
shall too soon be horrified by Russian atrocities committed by other
than Russian troops?

we read, with some surprise, that "MH. A. B. C. (Wesleyan) will
run as an Independent Candidate, and MB. D. E. F. will run as an
Independent Church Candidate." How fast this age of ours is
becoming! Candidates used to be contented to "stand"—now
they must "run!" Has the growing passion for athletic sports
any connection with this change?

POOR BRITANN'A!

eh?
AVAL disasters and Naval waste had ^een^the staple of Punch's
readings in the evening papers. Punch dreamed a dream. He
thought that he was standing in a large gallery of paintings,
rilled with pictures of BRITANNIA'S >aval victories. And as
he looked at the canvasses, he could not help noticing that there
were none of recent date.
Not a victory for forty years," murmured the Sage.
No, Mr. Punch," said a pert young Gentleman, dressed in a lounging suit. "We didn't dp very much during the Russian War,
Got bustled about a bit in the Black Sea by the storms, and laid up as snug as fleas in a rug in the Baltic?"

eard the Guv'nor talk about
you, Mr. Punch. It 's very seldom he does anything
'You cannot do better than walk in your i athcr s footsteps." said Punch, sententiously. "The Sage is a parent himself."
'So he tells me," laughed the flippant young man. "But between you and me I don't think the old 'un got on much better
than I do. Only you see ho had the IUCK on his side, and I haven't, which makes all the difference; don't it?"
Punch and his companion had now left the picture gallery? and somehow (after the fashion of dreams) were standing in a dockyard.
The placel seemed to be in a state of great confusion. New ships, that had scarcely felt the water splashing against their hulls, were
resting in dock, undergoing extensive repairs, boats (cheap in one sense, and dear in another) were oeing reconstructed, regardless of
expense; waste and baa management seemed to be the order of the day on all sides.

Victim of Bicycle Eiders (la ha- Groom}. "CHARLES, DO ASK THEM WHICH SIDE THEY EXPECT its TO GO?'
"We do a deal of tinkering, don't we?" commented JOHN BULL
JUNIOR. "The joke of the thing is, the Public never knows the
exact cost of a ship. Say we turn out the Tea Kettle for £20,000;
well, before twelve months are over, repairing the Tea Kettle,
putting in fresh engines, and replacing the old masts, and changing
the timbers of the keel, and all that sort of thing, you know, runs
the original £20,000 into six figures. Hallo, Sir! And how are
you?"
This salutation was addressed to an old Gentleman, wearing a
very gorgeous uniform. The old Gentleman smiled, and put up
an ear-trumpet. The question was repeated.
"Oh, thank you! thank you!" said he; "I am as well as can
be expected. I don't like the noise and the bustle; but they are
all very kind to me, and tell me what to do. Still I prefer my
nice quarter-deck, in a quiet harbour, to all this confusion. But
you must really excuse me; for if any of my men see me, they will
be sure to ask me some awkward questions.about their work; and
then, dear me, what should I do?"
"The Superintendent of our Dockyard, Sir," answered JOHN
BULL JUNIOR, as the old Gentleman hobbled off; "an Admiral,
Sir, and, as they would say in SULLIVAN'S Trial by Jury, 'A good
one, too.'"
Punch and his companion now passed a number of Warrant-
Ofticers, who seemed to have much spare time upon their hands.
"The Carpenters, .Sir," explained the young man. "In the
Guv'nor's days they used to look after the building of their ships,
and when they were built lived in 'em until they were tugged into
dock to be broken up. Now-a-days we keep 'em hanging about
until we think they are wanted."
The Sage and his guide were now in an office. Scattered over the
floor were dusty bundles of papers, tied up with red tape, and on the
walls were plans of foreign Iron-clads.
"Not bad these," said JOHN BULL JUNIOR, pointing to the plans;
"we shall build some like 'em, some day. Take a weed?"
"I never smoke in office hours," replied Punch, drily.
"I do," observed the young man, as he leisurely lighted a cigar.
"Snug hole this? This is where I do my work. "What's that you
are looking at?"
'A list of the British Navy," read Punch.
'Ah! now call out the names of some of the ships, and I will
tell you where we should send them in the case of war.
'The Vanguard," murmured Punch.
'Well," laughed the young man, " we should leave her where
she is. to protect the bottom of the sea."
'Tne Alexandra, one of the largest of our Iron-clads?"
'Disabled for the present. Both blades of her screw bent."
'The Rover, one of our new corvettes?"
'Also disabled for the present. Came to grief over the mea-
su -ed mile."
1 The Valorous f"
'In port. Her machinery went wrong."
'The Opal, the Hydra, the Boadicca f All fine ships."
'Well, they have broken down, too."
'And the Thunderer?"
'Now you are chaffing me, Sir," said JOHN BULL JUNIOR. "You
know as well as I do that the Thunderer blew up, and"
"Chaffing you, Sir!" angrily interrupted Punch. "Do you
think that the efficiency of the British Navy is a matter for chaff?
Why, Sir, upon our Navy depends the greatness and grandeur of
our mighty Empire! Without the sovereignty of the sea England
(whose flag floats in every quarter of the world) would sink into the
condition of a fourth-rate power. And you, with these mighty
interests at stake, dare to talk to me of chaff!"
And Punch brought his fist down with such force that the shock
woke him.
And when Punch was awake he only wished that he had been
dreaming!
ON several occasions lately CAPTAIN SHAW has been able to report
that there were " no fires in the Metropolis." Considering the price
of Coals, this is not surprising.

SWINDLING MADE EASY.
ow should there not be an
abundant crop of Fashion-
able Swindlers when the
world abounds in such
fools as stand confessed in
the case of the "COUNT
VON Ho WARD"? The more
impudent the imposture,
the more helplessly yield-
ing the victim.
One can almost imagine
after reading of the
"Count's" modus
operandi, that his corre-
spondence with his dupes
must have run somewhat
as follows:—
BRUSSELS,
April 1st, 1876.
DEiE Sin,
IT is true I only
know you from finding
your name in a Post
Office Directory, but I
take a great interest in
you, and hasten to inform
you that you are entitled
to Forty-Thousand Pounds under the Will of your relative,
ME. WILLIAM NOODLE. I alone can get possession of the Will. I
shall require remuneration. Yours &c.
A. NOODLE, ESQ. VON HOWARD (COUNT).
Mr DEAR SIH, LONDON, April 3,1876. •
How can I sufficiently express my gratitude? Of course
I shall be most happy to pay you for your trouble. It is true, I
never had a relative named WILLIAM, my only relative being
ME. Ton NOODLE; but no matter. Send on the Will at once.
Yours, gratefully,
COUNT VON HOWARD. A. NOODLE.
Mr DEAE SIR, BRUSSELS, April 6, 1876.
A COMPLICATION has arisen. The Will is deposited with a
Banker, who claims five hundred pounds on it. What is to be
done? I have not the ready cash, or, of course, would at once pay
it. Write by return. No gratitude. I only want two-and-a-half
per cent. Yours.
A. NOODLE, ESQ. VON HOWARD.
Mr DEAR COUNT, LONDON, April 8,1876.
I HASTEN to send you five hundred pounds as requested.
Would you like any more? Don't be bashful. Of course I shall be
glad to receive the Will or the Forty-Thousand Pounds in due
course. yourB alway8,
COUNT VON HOWARD. A. NOODLE.
At this particular juncture the "Count," for some reason or
another, breaks off the correspondence, and MR. NOODLE has the
hardihood to go into Court and complain of being swindled!

About Killarney and Muckross.—Except in a good old-fashioned
house genially decked for Christmas, I have never seen such a
profusion of holly in any one spot, as may be observed over and
over again along the roads in these parts. These excursions must
be remarked in my note-book as Red-berry days, or, more correctly,
Holly-days. Christmas, it is true, comes but once a year; but,
about Kenmare, the decorations are left up for the whole twelve
months. What a sight it must be in the winter! I wonder if
PUGIN'S Grand Cathedral at Killarney reaps the benefit of BO much
decorative wealth of holly in the neighbourhood P
Driving out of Killarney, on as fine and fresh a Sunday morning
as ever gladdened the heart of Celt or Saxon, I happen upon a
sketch that I wouldn't have missed for a trine. Coming round the
corner—whisk—at full trot, is a trim jaunting car, bearing a mag-
nificent specimen of a Franciscan Friar, in his habit as he lives,
lis shorn crown as bald and polished as a marble, and shining so
Brilliantly in the sun, that I should like to lend him my umbrella,
tor fear of a coup de sokil. Odd! he doesn't seem to be struck by
the—
Happy Thought.—Put up my cowl.
However, the fast trotter takes him out of sight before I can offer
liim the suggestion. My driver touches his hat respectfully to his
tleverenoe as we pass; and, not to be behindhand in politeness, so
do I. The good Father beams upon us in return, and salutes us
with his hand: for you see it would be a trifle difficult for him to
•eturn our salutation in kind, so to speak, as he hasn't a hat to lift,
or even a forelock to pull.
"He 's been saying Mass at MR. O'SOMEBODY'S house yonder,"
my driver explains, naming the residence of a gentleman some
eight miles distant. The carman is clearly jealous for the honour
and dignity of the clergy in giving me this explanation, because
otherwise, might not I, as a Saxon, and for aught he knows, a Pro-
testant Saxon to boot, go home and say, maybe at Exeter Hall, that
"the Monks in Ireland think nothing of breaking the Sabbath-day,
riding about in cars, and going out for jaunts and jauntings when
decent people ought to be at church." And I am pretty much of
opinion that this is the conclusion that would have been jumped at
by many of my prejudiced fellow-countrymen, whom no explanation
as to why that Friar was on that car, at that particular hour, on that
fine "Sabbath" morning, would have satisfied. And while on the
subject of cowls and friars, I cannot help noticing the utter absence
ofjthe " downcast look," "the hangdog expression," and the "scowl"
with which certain writers have credited "their Rivirinces."
Happy Thought.—The proverb here should be " 'tis not the scowl
that makes the monk."
The Catholic clergy are, it seems to me, for the most part, fine
broad-shouldered specimens of humanity, whose weather-beaten
countenances are as honest, frank, and cheerful as any you would wish
to see gathered round your own table at Christmas-tide. As for phy-
sique, the civil Po-lis force and the moral Po-lTs force appear to have
divided the picked Irishmen between them; for, the constabulary
ire already famous as a military force, and a magnificent corps might
be formed out of the Irish clerical ranks. Could BISMARCK be "the
O'BiSMARCK " for a while, wouldn't he like to try his hand at com-
pulsory enlistment of the clergy? If he did, begorr 'tis myself that
would wish him all the success he'd deserve—the rapparee, the
marauder!
One more note on the subject and I "ve done with it; if their
Rivirinces are not the "scowling," "hangdog" prowlers, that
ME. PETEE PREJUDICE would have us believe them to be. so neither
do they resemble those scandals to their cloth, so brilliantly and
entertainingly drawn by the late CHARLES LEVER. As a body, they
are unaffected, kindly, genial men. to whose nature the proverbial
priggishness of the parson is utterly foreign, while for their Deans
and Bishops—well, our friend SMITH'S butler, even in his morning
toilette, and at a disadvantage, has far more of the " Don "—not the
Spanish, but the College, Don about him—than a whole room-full of
Irish ecclesiastical dignitaries in their most gorgeous purple and fine
linen.
However, further disquisition as to cause, effect, &c., &c., would
be clearly out of place in these brief notes, and must appear in my
forthcoming work on Typical Developments, though in which vo-
lume, in which paragraph, or under what heading, it is, at present,
rather difficult to determine. Perhaps, under C., Cowl*,—for all this
sprang out of my noticing that Friar on the jaunting car.
At Muckross.—First, I am invited to see the Tore Cascade.
Happy Thought.—Tore about it.
Another Tourist is bound on the same errand. He is an American.
He is disputing a point with a respectable, middle-aged man, who
may be a bailiff, or a gamekeeper (and, in fact, turns out to be a
sort of bnth), who is demanding sixpence as the price of admission
to the Waterfall. Really? "Yes. Sixpence for the Waterfall,
Gentlemen, if you please: it's MR. HSRRSRT'S charge." Thank you;
and here are our tickets. Shall we leave our sticks and umbrellas
at the wicket? Are we to take care not to breathe upon the glasses't
Oh, I beg pardon! there are no glasses; and it is not a peep-show.
Well, then, do our tickets admit to the pit, or boxes, or stalls? Or,
if not, to what part of the house do they admit us?
"Oh! not to the house at all," replies our simple Showman,
taking my satirical question literally, " and you can see the Ruins
afterwards."
Entrance to the Ruins means "sixpence more," and another
ticket. Why it reminds me of Cremorne—not the place, but the
system of charging. As to the mere amount of sixpence,—well, I 've
no doubt, we should have given that enormous sum,—and, being of
a generous turn, more—to any Cicerone who might have been so for-
tunate as to conduct two such Millionnaires as the American Tourist
and myself over the place. But, as it is, we are paying MR. HER-
BERT; and ME. HERBERT ought to be here himself to take us round
his domain.

request hia visitors to give him the tips with which they had
intended to enrich his servants. "They get their wages," his

, ______ Hamlet is
performed by a Supernumerary. If I pay MB. HERBERT sixpence,
clearly it should be MB. HERBERT who should act as my Cicerone,
and not his subordinate.
Note.— It does destroy the romance of a secluded Fairy Glen and
a dashing Waterfall, if you are compelled to give sixpence for seeing
them. Only having parted with the coin, there remains this
advantage, viz., that we have acquired by purchase a perfect right
to grumble, and to find fault with everything.
"Why," says my American friend, superciliously, "this ain't a
patch on the smallest waterfall in our country," — and he will hardly
look at it.
"Not half as good as the Fairy Glen in Wales," I chime in.
"The trees are only chunks," says my companion, turning back
and descending the ravine.
"I 'd as soon pa'
Waterfall, the Stalactite Caverns, and Paris or London by Moon-
light, at the dear old Colosseum, and all for one shilling; i.e., only
sixpence more than MR. HERBERT'S charge for this Waterfall alone
—or rather for this Trickle, which is all Tore and no Tumble.
Hang it. they might have turned on some more water for the
money. However, when there has been no rain for a fortnight. 1
do think that MB. HERBERT ought to lower the price. To equalise
itj let him charge twopence extra after a ihower, and sixpence more
after a week's heavy fall of rain; and advertise both effects in the
local papers.
Happy Thought (for a Gentleman who it fortunate enough to pos-
sess a Waterfall and a Ruin on his grounds.—Make something hand-
some by 'em,
Were I Ma. HIRBBRT of Muckroas,
I rather would be with my luck cross,
And lose pennies many
Before I 'd charge any
For seeing the beauties or Muckrow.
But perhaps the owner of the estate is of a different opinion, and,
after all, it is his affair—not mine. The Tourist is requested (on
the ticket) not to give any gratuity to the Showman. But isn't the
same simple-minded request to be found placarded up on all Sta-
tions? And do we therefore refrain from presenting the Guards,
the Ticket-Collectors, and the Porters with the furtive, but welcome,
sixpence, or the modest, but not less welcome, fourpenny and three-
penny/or value received f Do we not fee the boxkeepers at theatres
where no gratuities are allowed, and where, of course, none are ever
offered or accepted? It is a vicious practice, a demoralising custom,
but it is a matter of habit; and so, when MR. HERBERT, M.P.,
requests us not to give his employe a tip, what, I ask, is the conse-
quence i* I will answer for myself and for my American friend. . .
and, of course, we did not do anything of the kind, that is any more
than any other gentleman tourist would when visiting Muckross.
Muckross Abbey.—Worth all the sixpences that ever were coined.
"A kinder sollum place," says my American friend.
It is, as he says, a kinder sollum place," and being both of us
considerably impressed by the " sollumnity," we, by tacit agree-
ment, part company. I sit in the refectory and think " how many
have told of the Monks of old," and what a glorious race they were,
and I visit the chapel, and the Abbot's room, and I wander among
the tombs, and the cool dark cloisters. Wasn't it from a window in
Muckross Abbey that Hardress Cregan used to show a light to Eily
O'Connor, or vice versa; or wasn't it this at all at all, and am I,
as I rather think I am, all wrong? For why the D—ION Bouci-
CATJLT should Hardress Cregan be here and not at his mother's
house?
Alas! The Colleen Sawn has no more to do with Killarney and
Muckross than I have. She was drowned in the Shannon, I
believe, and Danny Mann was hung for it at Cork. The Colleen
Bawn Rock and Cave are delusions. We tried them. The nose of
our boat would scarcely run into the Cave, in which there was
about six inches of water, and standing upright was an impossi-
bility. Of course where you can't stand upright and can't sit down,
you must stoop or lie—and "Lord! how this World is given to
lying!"
Happy Thought. To bring ont a new magazine, to be called The
Truth. What a cruel publication it would be, destroying cherished
illusions, extinguishing old lights and substituting no new ones.
But if The Truth were told, what would become of History P
(Evidently a deep subject for an Essay in Typical Developments,
vol. xx., Article Truth.) However, The Truth about Killarney is
easily told,—it is lovely, beautiful as Truth itself in the abstract,
and I object to concrete from what I 've seen of it, and especially
judging from what I 've had to pay for it whenever it came into a
builder's explanation as to why the price of the work done exceeded
the guaranteed estimate. You mustn't look for truth in the con-
crete from a builder.
But this is discursionary, and as I am clearly exceeding nij
excursionary powers, let us hie back to the Victoria, and to-morrow
away for Glengariff. If I cannot obtain Truth, let my motto be
Progress.

JOHN BULL to a Great Western Director.
"The accident to the Flying Dutchman, which occurred on the 27th July,
at Long Ashton, differed in its character from most of the recent railway
horrors. . . . Its cause is clearly traced in CAPTAIN TYLBR'S Report. . . .
to defects of the most elementary kind .... for which the Great Western
Company must be held, not constructively responsible .... but directly so.
The Flying Dutchman, which connects the West Country with London, is
one of the swiftest express trains known in the kingdom. It maintains a
speed of some sixty miles an hour The rate of speed was not in itself
dangerous; the construction of the line was perfectly consistent with safety,
but the permanent way was not in good condition As CAPTAIN
TYLER observes,' immunity from accident depends on the preservation of a
larger margin beyond what is barely necessary to prevent actual or obvious
risk.' That margin 'had not been maintained. .... The Bristol and
Exeter line extends over seventy-seven miles, in the course of which the in-
spection discovered nearly 20,000 faults About 250 defects to every
mile of railway gives the Flying Dutchman some four chances of a catastrophe
to every second it travels at its highest speed."
The Times <tn CAPTAIN TYLER'S Report.
'Tis the pace, Sir, that kills? "Well, not always it seems
Am I reading plain print or indulging in dreams?
Two hundred and fifty defects to the mile!
At that neat little average Death ought to smile.
Pleased at being so courted in what one may say,
Without double entente, is a permanent way.
I should envy his nerves who 'd regard with composure—
I own that I can't—CAPTAIN TYLER'S disclosure.
I wish to ride fast, and am willing to run
The fair risks of the road; but I don't see the fun
Of four chances of smash to the second, effect
Of mere miserly pinflhing, or callous neglect.

To the pre-arranged perils of such a death-ride.
Twenty thousand defects! 'Tis a trifle too much, man,
In an eighty miles' spin with your fast Flying Dutchman,
A Signalman's blunder, a coupling that fails,
May appeal for allowance; but miles of bad rails,
Broken joint-plates by hundreds, and sleepers unsound,

You carry, I pay; mine the cost, yours the care;
I must ask for fair play in exchange for my fare;
That's our bargain in brief, and whate'er you may wish, you
Shan't, shunt on some line of irrelevant issue.
TYLER'S margin, my friend, must in fact be maintained,
And the means to that end he has clearly explained.
Neglect here spells Murder! "What's needful I '11 pay.
But not for long miles of bad permanent way:
"Westward ho! with grim Death! "—who must hold a free pass
On your line—is a bidding suggestive of brass.
One would almost think Death, that insatiate Spectre,
Had got a new berth, as Great Western Director!
Milk and Water.
IT has been stated that, one day last week, nearly 10.000 persons
paid for admission to the Dairy Show at the Agricultural Hall,
Islington. Many of these were farmers and other country people,
but the greater part no doubt Londoners, naturally anxious to see,
for the first time in their lives, samples of genuine unadulterated
milk and cream. The Prize Cows were among the principal objects
of attraction, but in that department many visitors observed that
they missed the Cow with the Iron Tail.

MR. PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
SECTION V.—AN OFFICER'S DUTIES IN PEACE AND WAR.

HEN Mr. PuncA met his
Pupils in the ante-
room, to deliver his
customary Lecture, he
found them all look-
ing deeply grieved.
COLONEL CHARLES,
of the Royal East
Mudborough Militia,
ENSIGN EUGENE, of
the Volunteers, and
LIEUTENANT AND
CAPTAIN GEORGE, of
the Grenadiers Green,
were surrounding
poor dear little FLELD-
MABSHAL SIR FBANK
GEEGEE, K.C.B., who
was weeping bitterly.
"Why. what is the
matter f" cried Mr.
PuncA, genuinely alarmed at his poor little favourite's weakly-expressed
distress.
"It is too bad!" drawled LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN GEORGE, of the Grena-
diers Green. "A fellow has written to the papers to say that the miserable
little chap should be retired."
"Why ?" asked Mr. Punch, in a tone of surprise.
"Because he had had sixty-eight years' service! " exclaimed the Lieutenant
and Captain, indignantly. "Why, I never heard of such a thing! The
Service, Sir. is going to the deuce!
"Why, the next thing they will do will be to go into that other extreme,"
cried COLONEL CHARLES; "they will retire all Militia Captains under two
years' service. If they do, all the companies of the Royal East Mudborough
Militia will be commanded by Sub-Lieutenants!"
"My dear Pupils," observed Mr. Punch, with a smile, "you may be sure that
it will be quite safe. Anything suggested by a civilian will never be adopted
by the Authorities of Pall Mall."
Dear little SIB FRANKY was soon consoled by the promise (given by Mr.
Punch) that the most powerful influence should be exercised on his behalf to
secure for him either the post of Constable of the Tower or the Governorship
of Chelsea Hospital. When the sweet little man was smiling once more, the
Sage of Sages commenced his Lecture :—
Part I. In Times o/ Peace.—The general duties of Officers in time of peace
should be to popularise the Army as much as possible in the places where they
may for the time be stationed. Of course the Colonel, as the Commandant,
should take the lead. SIB GABNET WOLSELEY, in his excellent Soldier's Pocket-
Sook, to which allusion has already been made, has (at page 13) given "what
all Officers should carry in their heads." Amongst the suggestions appears the
following excellent piece of advice: "Accustom yourself to time the pace at
which you travel, to count the number of telegraph poles there are to a mile,
and so ascertain how many yards they are apart," &o. In the same fashion
the Commanding Officer should visit the resident Gentry with a view to ascer-
taining their tastes, &c. He should make it a point to drop in at Five o'clock
Tea, with the intention of discovering the number of marriageable daughters,
the penchants of their mothers, &c. Having made the necessary " observa-
tion," he should next proceed to detail the duties of his subordinates. Thus,
he should tell off MAJOR TWENTYSTUN to Brigade Drill,
examination of Defaulters' Books, and Whist at penny
points with the local Vicar. The Captains, after their
companies have been paid and dismissed, should be
ordered to judging distances at Lawn Tennis, and Skating
Rink Drill. The Subalterns, who are required to act
as supernumeraries on Court-Martials, by the Queen's
Regulations, might perform similarly honorary duties
on Ladies' Committees for Hospital Balls or Charitable
Fancy Fairs. In all cases the Commanding Officer should
from time to time visit the various places at which he
may have stationed his Officers, to see that their duties
are being properly performed. Thus he should drop in
at the Vicar's, and say, heartily, "Hallo, TWENTYSTUN,
another revoke!" He can do no harm in helping a
long-service Captain round the Rink, when he discovers
that long-service Captain clumsily attempting to master
the difficulties of the outer edge; and he should occasion-
ally inspect the Ladies' Committees, to see that his Subs
are making themselves generally agreeable.
The Commanding Officer should be always ready to
give his subordinates " a lead " in everything. For in-
stance, should amateur theatricals be in vogue in the
town in which his Regiment is stationed, he should be
prepared at a moment's notice to cast himself for the
parts of "the Prince of Denmark" in Hamlet, and as
"the guilty Thane" in Macbeth. The facts that he
weighs over twenty stun and has not the faintest notion
of acting should not damp his ardour. In Cavalry Regi-
ments circuses and nigger minstrels have frequently been
organised. When this has been the case, the Colonel
should assume the principal characters himself—Clown
to the circus, and "Centre Man" to the niggers. He
must keep up the dignity of his rank even off parade.
In like manner the two Majors should be told off to
perform the dual duties (bones, tambourines, and jokes)
appertaining to the post of " Corner Men."
The other Officers should play a game of follow their
leader. They should flirt, sing, and make themselves
amiable. Their regimental duties should take about a
twelfth of their time—they can devote the rest of their
leisure to their friends. As it has been made a punish-
ment to have to wear uniform, they should dress them-
selves when they can in mufti. Of course fashions
change, but the costume most popular at the present
moment is a rig out which is equally suggestive of the
tourist and the livery stable keeper.
Part II. In Times o/ War— The whole duty of a
British Officer in the time of War is to remember that he
is a British Officer, and—to behave as such!
CONVERSATION ON SECTION V.
Ensign Eugene. My dear Mr. Punch, I have been
studying the Field Exercises, and really they appear to
me to be very difficult.
Mr. Pitnch. The directions, my dear ENSIGN EUGENE,
of the Volunteers, are certainly sometimes a little
obscure. No doubt the excellent compiler of Bradshaw's
Railway Guide had a voice in the editing of all military
books of instruction. But now let me hear how you
would each of you dismiss your men. We will pass
over dear little SIB FRANK GEEGEE, K.C.B., as he is
out of spirits, and come to you, COLONEL CHARLES, of
the Royal East Mudborough Militia.
Colonel Charles. My usual word of command, Sir, is
"Umps! Umps! Umps!" The Adjutant invariably
gives it the necessary interpretation.
Mr. Punch. Very good. And how, my dear Lieu-
tenant and Captain of the Grenadiers Green,—how would
you dismiss a parade?
Lieutenant and Captain George. Oh, by telling the
Sergeant-Major, or some fellow of that sort, that I was
off for the day.
Mr. Punch. Yes; and you, my dear ENSIGN EUGENE,
of the Volunteers P
Ensign Eugene. I should let my men see a clock
pointing to five minutes to the time of the departure of
the last train, and the Regiment would dismiss itself
without word of command. But to return to the Mili-
tary guide-books. Are not the foreign ones much
simpler than ours?
Mr. Punch. Much, my dear Pupils. I am happy to
say that this simplicity nas been partly taught by the
action of English Soldiers. When foreigners have had
to meet British infantry they have found one word of
command amply sufficient—" Bolt!"

TEETOTALISM V, TEMPERANCE.
PRESIDING the other night at a meeting held at Leicester, in con-
nection with that insidious association the Church of England
Temperance Society—which aims at merely promoting moderation
by moral suasion instead of enforcing total abstinence by law—the
BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH adopted, on that behalf, the argument of
which, Mr. Punch, let me tell you, we have heard too much,
namely that :—
"One hundred and fifty yeara ago the upper classes were quite intemperate.
There was in those days a proverb,' As drunk as a Lord,' but could that
proverb be applied now? Drunkenness in a peer would bo regarded as
degrading to his office, and in the middle-class it was now regarded as a
disgrace. This alteration had not been the effect of legislation, for legislation
was the same now as before; and if there had been this improvement in the
higher and middle-classes, why should they despair of its being the case with
the Working-Man? Why should the mechanic or the working man be so
disgraced any more than the peer or squire? Why should the stigma be
thrown on the Working-Man that he was as drunk aa a lord .'"
Why, Sir P For two good reasons. First, as a ground whereon
to demand legislation to prevent the Working-Man from drinking
anything stronger than tea. Secondly, because consistency will
then require that the Lords and Squires, and all the better classes
(inclusive of Bishops) shall be subjected to the same prohibition.
No such half-and-half measures—though an enemy to porter and
ale, believe me, Mr. Punch, I pun not—as these for us! Let the
BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH waste his breath on those whom he tells
that :—
"They might do much to remove the temptation from the Working-Man by
closing public-houses or getting him to abstain from attending them. But
what were they asking the Working-Man to give up? The public-house was
equivalent to the rich man's drawing-room, and he therefore urged upon, them
to provide for the Working-Men public-houses without drink, and clubs
managed by Working Men, not kept in leading strings and driven to the left
or to the right at every turn, but clubs in which Working-Men should manage
their own affair* in the same way as dukes, lords, and bishops worked their
clubs in London."
And so get as drunk as a Lord, a Duke, a Bishop, or any other
gentleman now usually gets, and no drunker? Not 11 we can help
it, Mr. Punch. No, Sir. On the contrary, we have all put our
hands to the plough, and our shoulders to the wheel, and laid the
mallet to the thick end of the wedge whose thin is the Permissive
Bill, and we don't mean to turn back till we have driven it home
and closed all the public-houses, and not only the public-houses for
the people, but also the Clubs for the Lords, Dukes, Bishops, and all
the rest of the classes who in general practice sobriety and pronounce
their aitches. The BISHOP OF PETERBOROUGH reckons without his
host—I don't mean his publican—in thinking to balk us of the
triumph we are bent upon. We will not rest till we have compelled
the community against their will to endure a privation which we
choose to undergo ourselves. Sir, we fight for principle; we go the
whole hog, and more, for pigs are only voluntary teetotallers, and
incapable of wishing to impose the blessing of total abstinence on
their kind, a peculiarity which distinguishes them from an uncom-
promising member of the United Kingdom Alliance and an out-and-
out GOOD TEMPLAE.

Mammoth Cave of Kentucky may be awe-striking, and Politics may
be red-hot, and revolvers protruding from many pockets. All these
things our Cousins have long been accustomed to, and apparently
enjoyed; but mark the sequel. They were not accustomed to MR.
O'CONNOR POWER, M.P., nor to MR. PARNELL, M.P., who visited the
United States to present an address to the PRESIDENT on behalf of
the Home-Rule Party. Consequently the SECRETARY OF STATE de-
cided that the address must be presented through the British
Minister in the usual way. With a ruthlessness which cannot be

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE NEXT ARTICLE-IN THE GOLDS."
(Translated from the Russian by Mr. Punch's Private Medium.)

THE time has arrived for speaking boldly and plainly to the half-
civilised barbarians who dwell in England, the land of fogs and
slaves. As this paper is addressed to the educated classes of the
most intellectual country in the world, it will be unnecessary to say
a word about the cruelties and " outrages" of Great Britain. Who
has not heard of the daily wife-sale in Smithfield, of the wretched
hirelings who are forced to gorge raw meat to amuse a senseless and
sensual country (in England these degraded wretches are called
"Beef-eaters "), of the frightful terrors of that home of murder in
Baker Street so gloomily described as " the Chamber of Horrors."
of the cowardly injustice of the " Habeas Corpus Act," and all the
loathsome "customs" (as the rites would be called in Africa) of
"Magna Charta?" Which of our readers has not heard of'all these
blemishes—nay, plague-spots—upon the civilisation of the nine-
teenth century? Why should we ask for an answer when no reply
is sure to be forthcoming? No, then let us address ourselves to the
subject we have in hand and at heart.
First, then, let us say that that august nobleman, PRINCE GORT-
CHAKOFF, has never been bribed. Although this accusation has
never been made by the British Press, there are ample proofs to
establish the fact that the Editors of the leading English journals
imagine that his Highness has been guilty of peculation. They do
not say so, but they must think so. They know what DISRAELI-
BEACONSFIELD is like, they know his combinations and trickiness,
and they must believe that the noblest of men and the purest of
patriots—in a word, GORTCHAKOFF—has been formed in the same
mould. Nothing could be more disgraceful, nothing could be more
dastardly, and—English! But as this thought must be in their
minds, it shall be our duty to expose their callous brutality.
The events of the Franco-German War must still be fresh in the
minds of every one. It will be remembered that Russia, with a
nobleness and bravery (which must fill every cultivated mind with
feelings of the strongest admiration), preserved a strict neutrality—
she sided neither with the French nor the Germans. Probably the
English Journalists believe that PRINCE GOBICHAKOFF received a
present of 2,000,000 roubles from BISMARCK on the one side and
GAMBETTA. on the other. No grosser calumny could be imagined by
the mind of man. Let BISMABCK and GAMBETTA be questioned, and
they will assert that PHINCE GORTCHAKOFF did not receive more
than two-thirds of the sums that have been mentioned. If they
deny this, let the Foreign Offices of Berlin and Paris be searched,
and then our Prince's patriotism will be proudly established by the
discovery of the receipts!
The story that PRINCE GOBTCHAITOFF offered DISRAELI-BEA-
CONSFIELD £5,000 for a third share in his (supposed—mark the word
—supposed) profits on the Suez Canal Scheme is utterly false. The
offer (it was £6,000) was made to the Premier's Private Secre-
tary, who kicked the Prince's emissary out of Downing Street! On
the most reliable information it has now been ascertained that
DISBAELI-BEACONSITELD did not make a miserable shilling by his
diplomacy; and as for his Secretary's kick, all we can Bay is this—
it will long be remembered by posterity!
And now we come to the story of the Prince seeking twenty-five
Generals' commissions, thirty-sis Military orders, and two hundred
and eighteen Patents of nobility. Well, of course, all our readers
are familiar with the facts of the narrative; therefore it would
merely be repetition to repeat them. We assert with the greatest
possible indignation, however, that many of the minor details have
been considerably exaggerated.
Everybody is aware, too, that our August Chancellor has received
for various services at various times 28,000,000 lire from KINO
VICTOR EMMANTTF.L (paid in paper money, and therefore not very
valuable), 4,000,000 florins from.the present EMPEROR OP AUSTRIA,
and 25,000 francs from the Swiss Confederation. But were not
these sums presents? Aud if he is always asking for douceurs
from the KIN& OF THE BELGIANS, His Majesty of Sweden and
Norway, the Monarch of Denmark, the KINS OF SPUN, and the
EMPEROR OF CHINA, does he always get as much as from his august
position he might naturally expect to obtain? Let the mean-
spirited potentates, who have only sent half the sum demanded,
reply to this home-thrust!
And now having answered the charges of the English Journalists
(charges _that were rather cowardly thoughts than dastardly asser-
tions), we throw ourselves upon the generosity of our supporters.
To our Customers.—Our Collector calls daily (when desired) for
orders. As arranged, he will bring the receipted bill (made up to
to-day's date) to-morrow morning to His Highness the PRINCE
G w. Will His Highness (if he should happen to be out)
kindly leave the money with His Highness's Secretary. The proofs
of next week's article have been sent as usual to the Chancellerie
for revision.
DREAM POEM A LA SWINBURNE.
(After a Supper of Pork Chops.)
SOFT is the smell of it, sweet the sad sound of it,
Mournfully mingled on yon mountain's top,
Grateful, and green, and caressing the ground of it,
Calm as a calyx, and deep as a drop.
Ah! the enlivenment, dark as the distance!
Ah I the allurements that lavish and lave!
Is there no sound but the sun's sweet insistence,
Night in the forest, and noon on the wave P
Fierce as a festival, fragrant and fading—
Grim as the grandeur that dreams of a day—
Is there no balm in Love's lavish unlading,
Born in the brightness, and grieving, and gray?
Lo! in the glimmering, sweet Aphrodite,
Ghastly and gracious, and groaning and grave,
Brilliant in banishment, mournful and mighty,
Soft as the samite that sinks in the wave!
Light are the longings that listen and linger:
Ah! the sick kingdoms that grapple and groan!
Red as Republics that point the far finger,
Or hail the horizon, aghast and alone.
Sinks in the distance the Dream and the Dreaming,
Leaves the wide world to its pining and pain;
From the great Universe, lo! in the gleaming.
Blazes the bandersnatch, faithless and fain!
Tea and Spirits.
A TEADEALEB in a leading thoroughfare of the City announces
the first arrival from the " Tea Harvest," of the " New Crop," per
steamers Glenartney and Glenearn. Breathes there the Scotchman
who can brook these denominations for steamers conveying cargoes
of Tea? What next? Another arrival of Tea, perhaps, per steamer
Glenlivat, which would naturally create in the Scottish mind a horrid
confusion between the "Tea Spirit Robur," and the Spirit of the
Glen, Sister Spirit to the Spirit of the Mountain, otherwise Moun-
tain Dew, in short, Whiskey.

[NOVEMBER 11, 1876.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GREAT STEP IN SPIRITUALISM!
(By Psycho Brahe.)

PIRITUAIISM ,is often
objected to on the
ground that spiritual
messages are usually
trivial, silly, and un-
grammatical. It is
said that the familiar
spirits of Spiritualists
are in general more
than familiar in their
familiarities, being
vulgar. This is quite
true. I have dis-
covered why. As the
law of gravitation was revealed to NEWTOS,
so, to compare mundane matters with things
spiritual, was that higher revelation made to
me. An apple fell upon NEWTON'S head, and
knocked gravitation into it: a spirit touch on
the seat of intelligence put a grander idea
into mine.
There are those who deny the story of
NEWTON and the apple. Perhaps they doubt
the reality of WILLIAM TELL and his apple
too. The discovery I have made will be
questioned and scoffed at by none but such
inveterate sceptics as those.
What is that discovery?
The singular and startling fact that the
spirits from whom or rather from •which
those lower communications come, are, in
fact, the spirits of lower animals, mostly, though not always, those of domestic pets. It is these latter that announce themselves as Annie,
Minnie, Titsy, Joey, and so forth.
One evening a few weeks ago. at our usual friendly seance, after the accustomed tippings, and raps which were loud and frequent, a
sound of scratching upon the table was heard, and immediately the touch of something light and velvety came on my head. My nose,
at the same time, was gently scratched. The Spirit gave by the alphabet the name of Tibbie. No party in our circle remembered to
have lost any relative known by that endearing appellation; but the pat on the head reminded me that it had been the name of a
favourite tom-cat which had recently departed this life. A rapid train of meditation concluded in the surmise that feline spirits might
possibly exist, and our unseen visitant be one of them. On inquiry, this, to the astonishment of all present, proved to be really the case.
On subsequent investigation we found that communications purporting to be derived from deceased friends, are often really made
by dogs and cats that were allowed in their lifetime to lie under tne family table, or at the family hearth, and so to obtain a knowledge
of family affairs, often imperfect; whence the spirit misstatements so remarkably common.
The generality of the tricksy and mischievous spirits we ascertained to be those of monkeys, mostly from the Zoological Gardens. A
tiger once gave the name of Ifero, and a spirit calling itself Dr. Johnson turned out to have been in life an elephant. The customary
untruthfulness of Spirits is beautifully accounted for by the moral deficiency natural to the inferior creatures, whose faculties arc
nevertheless in course of expansion and development in spirit-life. We received, however, some very friendly greetings from departed
dogs, particularly a poodle naming himself Walker, who afforded us much reliable information.
On onp occasion the spirit of an animal claimed to be that of a living writer distinguished .by his enmity to Punch. It was the
spirit of a jackass.

"WILLS OF THEIR OWN."
(Not from the Illustrated London News.)
THE Will and testament of HORATIO GROWLER, of Grumpy Hall,
dated November, 1846, has been proved under £200,000, whereby he
bequeaths his property in equal shares to his brothers JOHN and
JAMES. By a codical dated August, 1854, he revokes his bequest to
JOHN, on the ground that the latter has married a wife with a
squint. By a codicil dated January, 1861, he leaves all his property
to the Earlswood Asylum for Idiots, with the intent of thereby
equitably providing for his brothers and their families. A codicil
dated June, 1867, contains mere personal abuse of his relations, as
do codicils dated May, 1870, and July, 1872. A codicil, dated
September, 1875. leaves all his property to his Cook, "the only
woman he ever knew who could make a leg of mutton last from
Sunday to Saturday." It is probable that this "Will will be disputed.
The Will of HANNAH MARIA SABAH, relict of JOHN FOODLES, dry-
salter, dated June, 1870, has been proved under £90,000. Testatrix
leaves to her four sons £50 each, and to each of her seven daughters
£100, and bequeaths the remainder to the founding of a hospital
for lost dogs and cats.
The Wfll of PATBICK O'FLANAGAIT, dated "either July or
August." 1872. has been proved under £300. By it £5000 are left
to the British Museum, to purchase the ancient sculptures of Ire-
land; £10,000 to the National Gallery, to encourage Irish Art, and
£10,000 to the Zoological Society, to form and maintain a collection
of Irish wild beasts. The testator leaves all his kingdom of Tip-
perary to his brother-in-law, AUGUSTUS O'LEAHY, "hereby
apologising for having broken the latter's head at Clonmel Fair "—
and also the ancient regal Crown, " when that thief LANAGAN brings
it back." By a codicil of a later date, testator bequeaths so much of his
stock of blue-stone whiskey, "as may not be consumed at the time
of his death," to his cousins, on the condition that "they do not
make beasts of'themselves at his funeral."
The "Will of LYCURGUS SOLOMON, Journalist, dated March, 1874,
has been proved under £800, which sum has been left to establish
an Asylum for Indigent Authors. To FITZIIORBIS BELVEDERE,
Actor, is left the critique, wherein Testator declared that the afore-
said FITZMORBIS BELVEDERE was "the very worst Actor that had
ever tried to bring SHAKSPEABE into contempt." To MONTMOBENCY
ST. JOHN, Dramatist and Actor, is left the critique, wherein Testator
declared that the aforesaid MoNTMORENCr ST. JOHN was " as little
capable of acting the part of a Gentleman as he was of describing one."
To GEORGINA LA ROSE, Novelist, is left the critique, wherein Testator
declared that the aforesaid GEORGINA LA ROSE "had better cease
staining her fingers with ink, and deyotu what little intellect she is
endowed with to the making of slippers, or the turning of a
mangle." To the Managers of the different Metropolitan Theatres
are left several unacted Tragedies, and to the various Publish-
ing Firms of London are bequeathed some hundredweights of
manuscript.
The "Will of WILLIAM SIKES, Gentleman at large, dated October.
1869, has been proved under a nominal sum. To his "firm pal,
JACK, he bequeaths his favourite Jemmy; to his "Rorty Cully,"
BILL, the "TICKER," which he "bunged from the old cove on
Denmark Hill;" and to his "Leary Bloke," BOB, his unexpired
Ticket-of-Leave.

THE LAST TRIBUTE OF RESPECT.

)UND trumpets, and roll drums, for
this Lord Mayor's Show above all
its predecessors. Besides SAS-
OER'S Elephants and the PRIME
MINISTEB'S speech, and the
presence of the Arctic heroes at
the Banquet, ;Lord Mayor's Day
will this year possess another
source of interest, and that of a
deeply pathetic character. There is a mournful probability that this is the last
time the great State Civic Procession will pass beneath Temple Bar. Such
being the. ease, it has very properly been resolved to treat the venerable barrier
with every possible mark of respect. The Joint Committee to whom has been
entrusted the painful duty of'making suitable arrangements on this melancholy
occasion, have issued tho following programme:—
On the 9th of November, Lord Mayor's Day, Temple" Bar, which the utili-
tarian spirit of the age has doomed to a speedy destruction, will be draped in
black, with the word "Farewell" inscribed in silver letters on the fa£ade.
The windows of CHILD'S Bank will be carefully closed, and a black flag
hoisted, bearing the motto—" For the last time."
When the procession arrives at the Bar, the military escort will present
arms, and the various bands will play a solemn Funeral March.
The Banners of the City Companies will be lowered and furled.
The Bells of the City Churches will cease ringing.
The Lord Mayor will rise up in the State Coach and say a few appropriate
words.
The Sheriffs will hide their emotion in their pocket-handkerchiefs.
The Aldermen and Common Councilmen will deposit wreaths of Immortelles
all round the base and on the tops of the gates.
At the Banquet in the evening, touching allusions will be made by the Prime
Minister and other Speakers to the only drawback to the festivities of the day.
The "Waiters will be affected to tears. The late Lord Mayor will recite his
"Elegy on Temple Bar." Many of the guests will go home and dream of the
dear old Bar transported to the Embankment, or South Kensington Museum, or
Salisbury Plain. _____
Physicians and Feemales.
WOMEW are now eligible for the licence of the King and Queen's College of
Physicians, Dublin, and other licensing medical bodies are expected likewise
to admit candidates of the gentler sex. There are some amongst the brother-
hood of Physio who contemplate the admission of sisters with disfavour. Le1
us hope this does not arise from a feeling of mean jealousy and a fear ot
competition with women such as that which possesses tirades-unionists. What
medical man, that is a man, can be afraid of a medical woman? Breathes
there the physician, in any considerable practice, who apprehends that the
rivalry of females could'ever possibly diminish his fees?
ONE Pole Russia will never succeed in coercing—the North.
WELCOME BACK!
(A Home-Coming Hail to our Arctic Explorers.}
"When commiserated with on their frost-bitten cheeks and
ingers, LIEUTENANT KAWSON jovially replied,' Well, at last we
feel that the cheers from Southsea Beach have been fairly
arned.' "—Story of tht Expedition.
WELL earned indeed! And as our cheers
Rang high and hopeful in your ears,
When echoing from white Albion's shore,
Went forth our Vale,
So, hailing your return, they rise,
As, clear through chill October's skies,
In Ave glad old England's roar
Greets you right gaily I
From'Ancient Ice-Sea's silent lip,
From bergs' and floes' death-dealing grip,
Our Arctic Argonauts return,
Though foiled, spoil-laden.
On many a coming winter night
Tales of their long and well-waged'fight
Shall make eyes glitter and cheeks burn
Of youth and maiden!
Northward, where earth no longer lifts
Her barren rook through deep-down rifts
Of the Ice-realm, they pushed their quest,
Elate, undaunted I
Northward, where neither Polar Bear
Ventures to make his lonely lair,
Nor Seal his bed, nor Knot her nest,
Mid wastes death-haunted!
All through that six-months' Arctic night,
Whose watches are slow weeks, whose light
Is the rare moonshine, they withstood
Their Frost-foe stoutly;
And with the first reluctant gleam
Of the pale Spring's returning beam,
Hope's fitful light of promise wooed
Once more devoutly.
In vain! Those grim Ice-ridges rose
Phalanxed athwart the frozen floes:
The Polar Sea's stern outworks mooked
Their best endeavour.
And back, with steps now fain to lag,
They turned; but left the old Country's flag
On the Globe s northmost bastion, loosed
In ice for ever!
"The pole impracticable?" Well
Another day, perhaps, may tell
Another tale. 'Twill ne'er deny
The meed now given.
Skoal! to our Northmen—NAHES'S band I
Though from that white and wondrous land
To wrench its heart of mystery
In vain they 've striven.
Welcome! Well done! Whoe'er they be
Who o'er that Pateocrystic Sea
Win farther Pole-wards, none, be sure,
Can faineants find you:
Though lubbers funk, and prigs deride,
BULL nails his Arctic lads with pride,
And prays good rest to the brave four
You left behind you!
AWFUL THOUGHT.
ScHOOL-BoABDS are, we know, a necessary accom-
paniment of our condition here, hut who would have
dreamt of their necessity hereafter? Yet it is plain
that "ALLTE" (Mis. SLADE), who spells "shown"
"shone," would not pass in our dictation standard.
THE Standard announces, in its largest type.'' Tlie Last
Conspiracy in Spain." We are delighted to hear it.
THE Great Duke asserted that an Army fought on its
Stomach. The Servians evidently have no stomach to
fight on.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
A Visit to the Prince of Wales's, with a Short Disquisition on
French and English Audiences, and a few words on the present
Peril.
_ SIB,—Peril, at".the Prince of Wales's, haa long since been suffi-
ciently discussed by.competent critics, and has undoubtedly made a
considerable impression on what is called the " play-going public."
Your Representative's esteemed, but somewhat harem-scarum
friend, PEQGUL BET, being in an undecided state of mind as to
whether he shall return to Constantinople or not—an Eastern ques-
tion which will be decided for him affirmatively or negatively by a
peaceful or warlike solution—(and if there is peace I may sing of my
Oriental chum, "He will return, I know him well "—while if there
is war he will.1 stay where he is at his house in Tyburnia, and
become the Bulbul of Bayswater)—my friend, I say, being in this
feverish condition, is no companion for Your Representative, on an
occasion when 'a Jcool head, calm judicial acumen, and a mind free
from bias or prejudice, are in requisition, as they are when anyone
interested in .the well-being of the Drama visits the Prince of
Wales's Theatre, to witness the performance of any piece produced
under the management of .'Ma. and MRS. BANCROFT. _ By this time
every one knows that Peril is " adapted for the English stage from
M. ViCTOHiEN SASDOTJ'S Nos Intimes "—I quote the Playbill—but,
as the qualification^" for the English stage" implies so much, I
would prefer to, consider the Play on its own merits as a production
of the
"BOWB, Brothers, BOWB,"
•Written under a censorship far stricter than that of the official
Licenser of Plays. "Adapted for the English stage," is, in effect,
an apology for the adaptation; for when so "strong" a piece as
Nos Intimes is submitted to the process of adaptation, it must be
bonsiderably weakened before it can be considered as food fit for
such bsbes as an English audience is supposed, by competent
authorities, to he j that Is. as compared with a French audience.
There is, I admit, a vast difference between an English and French
audience witnessing the same play. An English audience—as it
appears to me—looks on at the action of a play as at realities, while
a French audience regards it as representing probabilities—or. as
Puff says in The Critic, "Things just so strange that, though they
never did, they might happen "—which, if seasoned with sufficient
wit by the Author, and artistically rendered by the Actors, are
quite good enough for them pour passer le temps. As to anyone in
i French audience being either better or worse for assisting at far
'stronger" plays, I don't believe it for a moment. Are we,
pharisaically, to hold up our hands in horror, and thank Heaven that
in English audience is not as a French audience, because the latter
only consider as an artistic question what we will insist upon con-
'usmg with one of morality P Am I a poisoner, or an intriguer,
i plotter, and a man of mystery, because I prefer beguiling my
eisure with the works of ME. WILKEE COLLINS and M. GABORIAU to
;hose of Dx. CUMMU?o? No; if highly flavoured bisque is too strong
for English stomachs, don't water it, and make it into a compara-
;ively tasteless mess, but simply ignore it altogether,—have nothing
•a do with it. I confess, for my part, I am for giving the English
dramatist a range as unlimited as is possessed by his French
confrere, because I feel sure that he would use, and not abuse, such
liberty.
Peril, however, has not been " freely adapted," it has been "drawn
mild." The "peril" is very slight; I was scarcely "rippled" by it.
t did not see that Mas. KENDAL was at any moment in great danger
from the advances of that audacious little Don Juan, MR. SUDDEN.
In fact, the perilous situation was on the whole, just the one on
which the success of the piece seemed least of all to depend.
But, on the other hand, how admirably the piece has been put on
the Stage! Fortunate is the Author 01 a Comedy who can find it
produced with such attention te even the very slightest detail.
That the Management is to be congratulated on the cast, one
glance at the _playbill is sufficient to show. Oiven the Piece as it
u, and the acting is, on the whole, excellent all round. But I cannot
help asking what is the character MRS. KENDAL is expected to
portray! Does Lady Ormond love her husband P Yes or no P If the
First Act means anything—no, decidedly. Does she love Charky
Bradford f Well—I should say no. But she is supposed to like him
considerably, or else, at all events, she wouldn't go such lengths of
flirting—or more than flirting—with him. Yet, after all these
glances, and sighings, and hand-pressings, when the natural conse-
quence follows, and" he'declares his love, is she "only pretending"
when she refuses to understand him? This Scene is to me inexpli-
cable. Or are we supposed to be witnessing the result of the growth
them both

may in
_... .._, __ .. ._ .. ?No.
Does she herself give the explanation of the whole difficulty when,
pressing her hands to her forehead, she exclaims that "she doesn't
know what to^think, and wishes she could stop thinking "? Is she
a mild sort of Frou Frou f The character seems to me, as somebody
says in Hard Times, "All a muddle," and MRS. KENDAL herself
does not appear to be quite satisfied as to " what they (the adapters)
meant by it."
The others of the dramatis persona are all distinct characters.
MR. BANCROFT is. down to the ground, the middle-aged English
Baronet, honourable and loyal, preferring country ito town life,
thoroughlyjhearty and consistently phlegmatic. The only f aultlc ould
find with Dr. Thornton (MR. KENDAL) was that he seemed to me to be
a trifle too old for the lover of so young a girl as Lucy Ormond (Miss
BUCKSTONE). The Crossley Seeks (MR. KEMBLE and MRS. LEIGH
MTTRRAY) are—granting the hypothesis that such people would have

time, quite " a model boy. To omit " Kemp, the Butler," would
be an injustice to MB. GLOVER-and to the Management. The Chief
Butler in PHARAOH'S household couldn't have been more perfect—
and he must have had a very good character from his last place.
(By the way, which was hung, the Butler or the Baker ?—however,
it is of no importance now.) And last, but far from least, is the Sir
Woodbine Orafton of MR. ARTHUR CECIL, which is in nearly all
respects admirable. But if there is one touch of nature in his per-
f ormance'more than another which makes the whole audience kin,
it is his "business" (to speak technically) in the commencement of
the Second Act,—so characteristic of an utterly selfish man in a
country house, when he has a chance of 'disappearing with the
morning newspapers. If it is a very_ little overdone, if it has just a
touch of the Palais Royal hand in it, it must be remembered that
some exaggeration is absolutely necessary on the stage, and it really
is not until Sir Woodbine has surreptitiously collared his fourth or
fifth newspaper that the audience begin to enjoy the humour of the
scene.
There are. few theatres where so enjoyable an evening can be
passed as at the Prince of Wales's. The piece is mis-named Peril,
it should have be_en The Hare and Many Friends—but perhaps
there were professional reasons against this. Yet surely if this were
so, then for the ROWE BROTHERS to make ME. BANCROFT at the end

etiquette—wasn't it, my brothers, my first ROWE, and second HOWE?
By the bye, I have seen the sliding roof at the Canterbury Hall.
ME. VILLABS, the energetic proprietor, appeared twice on the stage
to announce the sliding back, and then again the back-sliding. It
was a very moving sight. This new place of entertainment is well

enter, and cool grots wherein to sup. The Hall was crowded, as
some rumour had got about that the Primate of All England (which
sounds like a set of cricketers) was coming to visit the Canterbury.
Of course it was a canard sauvage, but, Sir, Tour Representa-
tive had a real treat on the night of his visit to the Prince of

MR. PUNCH is, with reason, proud of his name, but never was so

to affix it to a mountain on tho edge of that ice-world from which
even British pluck has turned back baffled. He has just received
from Portsmouth this flattering communication:—
Sin, Fortimottth, November 4th, 1876.
We hare the honour to inform you, for communication to your Con-
tributors, that in consideration of your world-famous services to the cause of
wholesome mirth, innocent laughter, and general good-fellowship, to which
all Arctic Voyagers are so deeply indebted for the spirit that alone enables them
to resist the cold and darkness of a six months' night, and all the other hard-
ships of Arctic enterprise, we have unanimously agreed to give the honoured
name of Mr. Punch to one of the principal mountains to the northward of
Mount Hall. This mountain is the first on whose face, for two days before
we saw the sun, we observed the warm glow that foretold the coming spring
time, and seemed to us like a greeting from our Southern home.
We have the honour to bo, Sir, your obedient servants,

LA PIETA DI PIO.
THE POPE the other day, in the spirit of forgiveness, was pleased
to sing a Requiem for the souls of all his enemies, who, whilst
living, were chiefly instrumental in depriving him of his temporal
power. These included not only NAPOLEON THE THIRD, who, to the
best of his ability, had befriended His Holiness in keeping the
Italians out of Rome, but comprised also COUNT CAVOUH, by whom
as much as possible had been done to despoil him of his dominions.
The list of his defunct enemies comprehended others supposed to
have incurred the "greater excommunication^' and among them
MAZZINI, who whilst living was, one would think, a sheep as far
astray from the Papal fold as even the ARCHBISHOP or CANTEBBTJRY.

ARCTIC DIFFICULTIES.
THE welcome return of the heroic Arctic Explorers
affords Society a fresh topic of conversation for the time.
The Expedition having come back rather unexpectedly,
it is to be feared that Society is not sufficiently well
prepared for the demand thus suddenly made upon its
stores of knowledge. Let us supply a few simple tests
and institute a new kind of " Polo."
Does Society know what is meant by the North Pole, and
where the North Pole is? and what is likely to happen
to those, if any, who may reach it? what, when they
had got there, would be the state of the case as to the
compass, and the stars, and the degrees of latitude and
longitude, and things in general?
Does Society know what is the latitude of the North
Pole, and generally what is understood by the term
"latitude, and wherein it differs from longitude, and
why both are so called?
What does Society understand by "Lat. 83 deg.
7 min. N. "?
Can 'Society say why such repeated efforts have been
made to reach the North Pole?
Does Society know the difference between the North
Pole and the South Pole, and whether it is very hot, or
very cold at the latter place?
What does Society know about Greenland, Baffin's
Bay, the "Palseoerystic Ocean," Zero, Freezing-point,
the Esquimaux, and Pemmican?
Can Society name any three great Arctic Explorers,
living or dead, besides the Commanders of this last
Expedition and SIB JOHN FBANKIIN?

excommunicated wretches, if after their death the POPE neverthe-
less considers them not past praying for, and even has the charity,
in fact, to pray for them. We are irresistibly reminded of another
illustrious martyr to misrepresentation, equally magnanimous.
"Charity, my dear," said Mr. Pecksniff, "when I take my chamber
candlestick to-night, remind me to be more than usually particular
in praying for Mr. Anthony Chuzzlewit, who has done me an in-
justice?" Could he not good-naturedly go a little further in for-
getting a quarrel, and manage to make it up with the existing
Italian Government?
A JOKE FOR A JOKER.
DE.VB StE WILFRID,
Of course you have read all about the Arctic Expedition;
particularly the interesting narrative given by the REV. ME. HOD-
SON, Chaplain of the Discovery. In October of last year, when,
Winter began, during which season that vessel wintered in " Dis-
covery Harbour," and the thermometer fell to many degrees, at one
time 70°. below ?ero; then, according to the statement of that
Reverend Gentleman—what do you think? Why, actually—
"The men had an extra glass of grog served oat to them, a Talk of a mile
in length was made in the ice by scraping away the snow, and this walk for
exercise was kept clear during the winter."
Fancy—as if their walking exercise would not have been amply
sufficient, at least with the accompaniment of a cup^ of tea or coffee,
to keep the men quite warm enough—the excessive absurdity of
serving out to them not merely a glass, but absolutely an extra
glass of grog! Hence it appears that, ordinarily in the Arctic
regions, even when the cold was little if any below zero,' they
were allowed at least as much as a glass of grog daily; and,
except those who made the grog and those who drank it,'good-
ness only knows how strong it was. Here is an enormity 'for
which pray do not forget, the next time, you harangue a Tee-
total "Permissive" Meeting, to denounce the Admiralty. And
here is a joke for you to let off, after your manner, upon that occa-
sion. Say that the only shadow of excuse to be made for a crew
drinking, or being suffered to drink, grog, at a place above 81" North
latitude,, is that ithe climate those topers were in is not a tem-
perate one. This, as a bit of anti-drink fun, will be said to be so
like your dry humour.
Ever yours, my dear SIB WILFEED, m
Sic VOB Non Vobis.
ITALY has set up—and, indeed, established—the claim of ANDREA
CESALFINO, of Arezzo, one of her most famous men of science in the
sixteenth century, to the great discovery of the circulation of the

PUNCH, OB THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.

CHAIRING THE CELT.
ow all Brither - Scots
should join in gratitude
to the excellent and en-
thusiastic PROFESSOR
BLACKIE for his ser-
vices in raising between
nine and ten thousand
pounds towards the
endowment of a Pro-
fessorship of Celtic in
Edinburgh University.
Considering that Edin-
burgh is the capital of
Scotland, and that more
than half of Scotia is land
of the Gael, it is little to
the credit of the modern
Athens that it should
have left this work to a
Lowland Professor.
Surely a Celt ought to
have been found ready to
set the Celts on fire at
home and abroad, for the
due upholding, fitting,
and filling of a Celtic
Chair. But if too much
have been laid on PRO-
FESSOR , BLACKTE, as the
stoker and poker of Celtic
sentiment, and the raiser, not only of the needful lire, but the still
more needful funds, for this endowment, it is pleasant to know that
JOHN HIELANDMAN all over the world, in Canada, the United States,
North and South America, Ceylon, India, Singapore, has shown
that wherever be his body, his heart's in the Hielands," by his
liberal response to the cry for funds for the Celtic Chair. So it
becomes what such a chair should be, a chair resting on Highland
enthusiasm and Highland contributions as its legs, on Highland
poetry and Highland patriotism as its arms, and the world-wide-
spread Highland nationality as its broad and firmly-woven seat.
PADDY, we need not remind our readers, is as Celtic as JOHN
HlELANDMAN.
JOHN BULL, too, if Saxon in warp, has a Celtic woof worked into
his national web, which furnishes some of the brightest threads in
the fabric. Why should not Oxford and Cambridge, and Dublin,
have their Celtic chairs as well as Edinburgh?
Now the first blow has been struck to such a handsome tune by
BLACKTE'S strenuous hand, let us hope it may be followed up, and
that, South of the Tweed, for the silly attempt to cry down the
language and literature of Wales—our own Celtic Sister—may be
substituted the more intelligent recognition of the value of both, to
those who dig about the roots of speech, and track the streams of
letters up to their fountain heads.
Meanwhile the gallant Professor has striven on behalf of his
Celtic Chair, not only by means of speech, subscription-list, solicita-
tion, meeting, and manifesto; he has, besides, written in furtherance
of his long-cherished and now happily obtained object, a genial,
glowing, and original book, The Language and literature of the
Scottish Highlands, showing the place of tne Celtic in the family of
tongues, and some of its leading a I Unities and principles of structure,
with a sketch of the history and characteristics of its bards from the
Middle Ages to our own time, including a succinct and sensible
summary of the Osaianic Controversy, in which the son of FINGAL
and JAMES MACPITERHON are very fairly, as it seems to us, set each
on his own bottom.
Let those who have yet to learn the fire and flow of Gaelic verso
read ALEXANDER MAODONALD'S Song of the Birlinn, or GALLEY OF
CLAN-RANALD and DUNCAN BAN'S Sen Dorain, consecrated to the
glory of the red-deer and the stalking thereof. The one was only a
village-schoolmaster, the other an Argyllshire gilly, and at his highest
a Sergeant of the Edinburgh Guard. But both are Poets by the gift
of God. The Professor has done justice to their glowing Gaelic in
his strenuous Saxon. And the volume is one that all should read
who want to learn why the Professor loves the Celts, their language,
and their literature, and to understand and help the movement for
the endowment of a Celtic Chair—nay, rather of a set of Celtic
Chairs, for the furnishing of a room now vacant in our University
Buildings alike in England, Scotland, and Ireland.
QUOTATION1 FROM PAHNELL.

COMING BOUND.
(From Sairty Qamp, of Shoe Lant, to Betsy frig, of Peterborough Court.)
DEAR BETST,
Tins 'ere comes a "oping aa 'ow you are well. It's a wale;
And old women like us needs our comforts—I hopes we may ne'er
find 'em fail!
Which you '11 praps be surpriged at this letter, as well to my PRIG
'ti» beknown
For some time we ain't hit it together, but each on us monthlied
alone.
But now as you 've turned up that WILLYUM—ah! BBTST, 'ow could
you, my dear,
Put up with that party so long? Yes. I'd miss him! But there!
there 's no fear
As he '11 step in betwixt us agin, which his last games with that
there old Turk
Must have jest about doubled 'im hup—as I 'm sure is a 'appy day's
work,
The artful and bragian traitor! As wanted to bustle my BEN;
Which, BKTSY, you knowod him &s sich, but he's took a new title
since then.
Ah, you, BETSY PRIG—Lord forgive yer !—did use for to chiwey my
pet,
Which, now he's so hup, is a tiling as I 'm awe you must greatly
regret.
But WILLYFM! the warmint! Oh, BETSY, that roan puts me clean
off my 'ead,
With his speeches, and pamphlets, and stuff, as Is tilings I despise
and yet dread.
But now you are down on 'im proper, it comforts my soul, BETSY
PRIG.
Let 'im have it, my dear, hot and strong, till he trembles like
thingemagig!
Which you soaped him too long; as perhaps he warn't grateful.
An! few on 'em is.
Why there's even my BEN—but no matter! You rounded a bit, as
he riz:
And now—well, my gingham's a good 'un, my pattens is things ns
strikes terror;
But your nasty sly pokes in his ribs is jest lovely, my dear, and no
error!
Then your love for the Turk is that touching it oftentimes moves
me to tears.
If he only had wings he 'd be fit, like a Syrup, for upperer speers.
While as for them Scurvy 'uns, ancetrer, your SAIREY sez, " Sarve
'era all right!"
And when BETSY sez ditto to SAIREY, I feel I must bust with delight.
Them Rooshuns is Hogres owdashus. Oh, BETSY, I shakes in my
shoes
When I thinks of the knouts, Ultimatums, and other wile 'errors
they use.
Do slang 'em, my dear. You "re a good 'un at Bouncers with lots o'
big "Caps."
And it does my heart good but to hear you a slogging them Musky-
wite chaps.
But wotevcr you do, my dear BETSY, don't give that ere WILLYUM
no peace.
Your Mop and my Pattens must squelch him, or drive him to Rome,
if not Greece.
Though you loved him and nussed him so long, chuck him up, he 's
a dead 'un, you know;
As my friend MISSIS P. M. G. HARRIS, assured me o' that long ago.
And, BETSY, let bygones be bygones! Though doing uncommonly
well,
Old SAIREY yet yearns for her pardner. Drop in, dear, and pull the
top boll.
The tea-pot and srimps shall be ready. Our sperrits two 'ot. withs
won't damp.
And a chat o'er old times with her BETSY will comfort
Your own
ONE of the latest additions to our Fleet is the Bacchante. It is
feared that she will be a wet ship and generally half-seas over.

DAEDALUS AND HIS DONKEY.
A CERTAIN Flying Machine was lately said to have
been taken over by its inventor, a British Daedalus, to
PRINCE BISMARCK, that he might inspect it in order to see
whether it was capable of employment for military pur-
poses. This is a question which may be imagined to be
rather more in MOLME'S way. It could not, however,
if the account of the Morning Post's Berlin Corre-
spondent is correct, have been solved, at least up to
within a few days ago, by either the Statesman or the
Warrior. But there may be some mistake in the state-
ment that:—
"ME. BALPH STOTT, the aeronaut from Dover, who has
lately made himself here an object of much discussion by his
flying machine, has suddenly resorted to every possible excuse
and subterfuge to disengage himself from the obligations
entered into. His ascent (fixed for to-day) before certain delegates
of the War Office, as well aa subsequent public representations,
is revoked, because Government refused to pay him immediately
a euro of £1000."
If this is true, then it may be said that our Dsedalus
refused to go up because the Prussian Government would
not come down. In that case let us admire the pru-
dence displayed on both sides, especially on the side of
the Prussian Government. Now if the situation of
the parties remains the same, Dredalus, for his part,
presents a resemblance to that other British artist, the
athlete who was accustomed to divert the public at
country fairs by the performance of balancing a donkey
at the top of a ladder on his chin for a consideration
subscribed by the by-standers to a certain amount, of
which he used to stand out for the completion, crying in
the meanwhile "Twopence more, and up goes the
Donkey!" But when the twopence had been subscribed,
up the Donkey went. "Will the parallel hold good to
that extent? Let the thousand pounds for the ascent
of Daedalus be paid him, will the Flying Machine go up?
If the Prussian Ministry will try the experiment of
handing him over the money—we shall see.
A Rectification.
MR. PUNCH is always sorry to make any mistake in
his assignments of artistic credit. It seems that MR.
GLOVER'S part in Peril is Kemp tfie Gardener, not
Meadows the Butler, as Our Representative Man averred
last week. The Butler's part is sustained by Ma.
NEWTON, who has written to call Mr. Punch's attention
to the fact.
OUK MAYORS.
FOLLOWING a practice which is as old as the time from whence it
dates, and has never been interrupted by disturbances at home or
abroad, by European wars or revolutions, by commercial depression,
or depressing weather—we publish to-day a list of Mayors who have
been elected to wield the Sword of Justice and handle the carving-
knife of hospitality, to take the chair at public meetings and public
dinners, to head processions and subscription lists, to distribute
prizes, inaugurate exhibitions, and open bazaars, and to be affable,
wise, bland, benevolent, courteous, kind, firm, charitable, impartial,
generally useful, and bountifully hospitable during the Municipal
year now newly commenced.
There is a breeze from the country blowing about some of these
elections this time which is pleasantly fresh and rural. Nottingham
has its Bowers, Hartlepool its Groves, Coventry its Banks. Ply-
mouth boasts a Moore, Tynemouth a Green. There is a Heywood at
Manchester, a Sherwood at Folkestone (ought to have been at Not-
tingham), and a Greenhow at Llanidloes; Furse at South Molton,
Dewes at Windsor, a Gill at Wakefield, a Hare at Tamworth,
and Birehenough at Macclesfleld.
There are some strange and unaccountable confusions of places in
the list, which no Topographical Dictionaries, or Gazetteers, or Maps
and Atlases can rectify or explain. From our childhood we have
known that Barnstaple was not in Wiltshire, and yet Wiltshire is
now in Barnstaple. Only in disordered dreams and Municipal elec-
tions can Galloway be at Gateshead; and if, Bedford is in Kidder-
minster and Melrose at York, there is, after all, some reason to hope
that there may be an excellent dairy of green cheese in the moon.
It is satisfactory to find that there has been no exclusive prefer-
ence for one nationality. The Mayor of Lancaster is Welch, of
Newcastle-on-Tyne a Scott.
A King again reigns supreme in Hull, a Bishop (not for the first
or the sixth time) in Colchester, and an Abbott, in Blandford—there
is a Pugh for them at Carnarvon—and at Hertford the rights of
women nave made such enormous strides that the Mayor of that
town is a Nunn.
The Chief Magistrate of Luton may not be a King, or a Bishop, or
even an Abbott, but he certainly is a Bigg man, and with him may
be coupled the Mayor of King's Lynn, who is all Thew.
Most capricious are some of the municipalities in their selections.
Dewsbury likes a Senior, Maidstone prefers a Youngman; Brighton
chooses a Lamb, Boltpn elects a Wouenden; Oxford flies as high as
an Eaglestone, Bury is'content with a Duckworth; Dorchester trusts
to a Lock, and Bradford to a Ward.
The Mayors of Glastonbury and Leamington are both Bright; they
have Tallents at Newark; and the leader of High Wycombe for the
next twelve months will be a Wheeler.
Why will not the papers give the surnames of the new Mayors
in all cases? Why use what would seem to be undue familiarity in
speaking of Abraham, and Absalom, and Gilbert, and Gyles, and
James, and Lewis, and Percival and Kalph?
As usual, the list shows a variety of pursuits and callings, com-
prising a Carter and a Collier, a Fowler and a Walker, two Turners
and (according to some authorities) a Tanner, a Shipman, a Cooke
(oh! fortunate Hanley), and, to bring the roll to a suitable con-
clusion, a Baker.
Mr. Punch has reserved to the last a Mayor with whom he feels
himself to be in entire sympathy—it is the Mayor of Chard, who is
Chaffey.
Just to Set Him Going.
DE. LEGGE, the Oxford'Professor of Chinese, we regret to hear,
has not a single pupil. How is this? Won't some self-sacrificine
undergraduate—there should be no lack of Chinamaniacs at Oxford,
if all we hear of the taste of the place is true—give the Professor a
Legge up?

SHALL BYRON HAVE A STATUE?

REDE BYRON! No. We would not have believed that BYRON could
have begotten such an emanation of Art so variously imbecile and
impotent. But the designs before the Committee are not the only
abortions or the worst that the occasion has provoked.
We have received several hundredweight of suggestions on paper
and in clay (it would be difficult, and luckily it is not the least neces-
sary, to decide which are the heavier), for a Byron Monument.
Having formed ourselves into an Artistic Committee, and examined
the rude and undigested mass of designs and suggestions, we subjoin
a few of the latter, which seemed to combine a dash of the amusing,
with their various forms of absurdity and impudence :—
r DEAE PUNCH, !•
THERE ought to be a Monument to BYBON, and I believe my
design to be the best. You remember the ever-famous lines where-
in the great poet vaunted the superiority of hock and soda-water as a pick-me-up? I cannot say that I altogether agree with his Lord-
ship. Bottled beer, brandy and soda, or best of all, milk, soda-water, and a dash of (,'nraroa constitute, in my opinion, the most
salubrious morning draught. But no matter, let us have a Statue of BrRotr, clothed in a dressing-gown, and raising a huge tumbler
of the foaming fluid to his mobile mouth! If the sculptor could manage—and I know several who could—to give a certain vagueness
of outline to the poet's features, we should then obtain a semblance of that which, as you doubtless know, always follows the night's
excesses,—the jumps. Merely thinking of the subject, I feel thirsty myself. Yours ever, j)t jt
SIE, H-
WITHOUT doubt the noblest passage in LORD BYRON'S works is that which refers to " thine incomparable oil, Macassar." Now,
if my Lord was depicted as sitting before his looking-glass, with a hair-brush in one hand, and a bottle of hair-oil in the other, we
should not only possess a worthy Memorial of a great poet, but a pleasing illustration of the manners and customs of the aristocracy
during the earlier part of this century. Nor is there any need to confine ourselves to Macassar. I, Sir, have invented an oil which is
far superior. Let mine be sculped! Yours truly, ROWLAND McAssAB.
P.S.—Bribery is beastly, but politeness is charming, so I enclose for your own hyacinthine locks, a dozen bottles of my celebrated
Anathranpologicostium.
PUNCH, !*!•
WHY should there be a Memorial at all to that Atheistical, Jesuitical, debauched poet? Why, Sir? Answer me that question.
Are you aware, or are you too deeply sunk—as I firmly believe—in the slough of grovelling ignorance, to know that there is still the
sum of £50,000 wanted for the conversion of benighted Borrioboolagha? And at such a crisis in the history of Christianity do you mean
to say that a statue should be erected to a profane, not to say profligate, poet? Bah! EXFTEB HALL.
Sis, Iy-
IF you will have a statue, I hope it will represent that noble woman, MBS. BEECHER STOWE, throwing dirt with both hands over
the face of that abandoned nobleman. Yours obediently, ^ HATZB OF POETBT.

Our sober Southern thunder is content to follow the lightning,

men to this inversion of the Southern order of things.

On the Road from Killarney.-M.ost strikingly situated by the
roadside high up the hill, so as to command a view of the entire
valley, is the Po-lla Barracks, with its grenadier of a Policeman
posted, as sentinel on duty, marching up and down with his side-
arms, and occasionally halting on the bridge to admire one of the
most beautiful views in the whole country. From here I get my
last peep at Killarney.
.>! reverderci mia bella!
By the way, these Police, posted up in the hills, must have, even
in piping times of peace, anything but a luxurious life of it. How
they must envy their Saxon brother, "Policeman X," in Belgrave
Square, whose beat is enlivened by the smiles of Cooks through area
railings, by gifts of cold meats from the larder, and by an occasional
flirtation with bright-eyed Housemaids. The Irish Constabulary
must have a rough time of it in a "difficulty;" but they seem to
be respected in their official capacity by the people.
Good signs of the times. (Noted between Killarney and Glen-
aariff.)—During the last three days, in the course of my drive, I
have seen three deserted P3-lis barracks. Stern, pitiless-looking
buildings they are, and in the most desolate spots. Let us hope afl
the " throuble " is over, past and gone; forgotten and forgiven.
Wild country between the last point where a glimpse of the
Black Valley is to be obtained ana my next halting place, Glen-
gariff.
It reminds me of the north of Cornwall. Only a few stone-built
cabins appear here and there at intervals in the valley and on the
hill-side. Not a nice spot this to meet an east wind. Even a Banshee,
more or less accustomed to this sort of thing, would find it uncom-
mon lonely and shivering here at night; and as to goblins and
sprites (I know what a sprite is from long acquaintance with him in

THE NURSERY ULSTER (PATENTED).
pantomimes), they would have all the fun taken out of them, were
they to select this spot as a play-ground, or night nursery. Most
dreary. Macbeth's witches from Scotland on a visit to some friends
here would be compelled to dance upon the heath, and energetically,
too, in order to keep their toes warm. Few and far between are the
cabins, and not a shebeen did I come across for miles. Few and far
between, too, are the poor-looking, white-washed, barn-like build-
ings, with a rickety cross at the top. denoting the Catholic chapel,
while a cottage rather larger and better-kept than those of the
peasantry on the route, is pointed out as "the priest's." Yes, here
he is up in the hills, a shepherd among the scattered flock, out all
weathers, and faring no better than his own poor. The appearance
of these chapels at intervals again recalls Cornwall to my mind,
with its neat, trimly-built, snug-looking but also white-washed
meeting-houses, or '''Little Bethels" as they are called. _ The
Bethels are, except, of course, for the regular services invariably
closed; the Catholic chapels are generally open for the greater part
of the day, service or no service, Sundays and work-days alike.
A friend of mine was trying to explain to a French Lady the
nature of these Wesleyan, or Independent, places of worship in the
north of Cornwall. She did not, or would not, understand him
(very perverse these foreigners sometimes), even though he explained
himself in the most admirable French. Madame, said he, "fes
petites maisons que vous voyez la-bas sont maisons aux rendezvous.'
She. stared at him, and smiled. So did I. "Permettez, there
Madame," he went on, a little nervously, "a ce que je m'explique
un peu. Quand je viens de dire 'maisons aux rendezvous,' je
voudrais dire 'maisons aux rendezvous de MoifsrETO WESLEY."
"Vraimentt" was all that polite French Lady replied, as she
binocle'd the houses in question, and turned away. If she ever
writes her tour in England, I should like to read her chapter on
Cornwall.
A cheering sign, which I have before noted en route, is the crop-
ping up of school-houses in the most desolate regions. The _ little
shoeless scholars, slates and books in hand, may be seen trudging to
and fro, the big ones carrying the mites, and all as happy as {in-
nocence and health can make them. Mrs. Hibernia may step out
now, well-nigh as proudly as in the days of old, when student*
from the confines of civilisation came to her for instruction and
final polish, and pointing to her little ones at school,'may say with
the Roman Matron, " These are me jew'ls."
Happy Thought.—Which very expression, "my jewels!" proves
Cornelia to have been an Irishwoman, bless her!
Politeness is the rule everywhere in Ireland. Even the pigs are
polite. The Irish pig is a great flaneur, hut when he meets a
stranger on the road he grunts apologetically (not grumblingly like
the Saxon pig), and either withdraws on one side to let you pass, or
nods at you, and then sidles off through a gap. Sometimes, when
there is a family party of pigs out for a stroll, one of the loiterers
will look round at you, if you come upon him suddenly, actually
squeak with delight, and scamper off to join the rest, as joyously as
though he were crying out, "Bedad, thin, here's a lark! here 's a
visitor! "What a bit of fun! Hooroosh!" and then all frisk off
together and disappear behind a gate-post.
As you pass you. will see them all looking at you, not staring
rudely like ill-bred Saxon children, but quite pleasantly, nodding
their adieux, and squeaking out " A pleasant journey to you! Love
to aU at home!" and other kind wishes.
Happy Thought. "Please the Pigs" is clearly an Irish expression.
But really the Irish pigs seem to be so very easily pleased. The
only exception to the rule of politeness on the road in Ireland seems
to be among the geese. I snare the antipathy of the Theatrical
Profession for the goose. Indeed, the day for a great annual
Theatrical Dinner ought to be the 29th of September, and the toast
of the evening should be, "Death to thb Goose!"
On we go. MR. O'SHATJGHNESSY, my car-driver, has not a great
fund of conversation. If he tells me a story, it is generally of some
personal and domestic interest, relating to the progress of his
children, with a melancholy reference to the hard times he himself
has of it, and his own exemplary long suffering, intended as a hint
to me not to stint the pourboire at the.end of our journey. He is
evidently speculating on "one bumper at parting "—though, Heaven
knows, what with.the state of the roads and the springs, the one
bumper at parting must be a very powerful one to surpass all that I
have gone through in. car-riding since the commencement of this
tour.
MB. O'SHAUGHtfEssY repeats himself too. He tells me the same
story three times in twenty miles. When he begins it again for the
fourth time, I quietly take up the.running and finish it for him,
whereat he appear* a trifle surprised, and is silent for a time, clearly
wondering where on earth I could have obtained the information.
At every turn in the road, and at every change of scene, he asks
me, "Isn't this a bhewtiful dhroive. Son-?"
Becoming tired of replying "Yes "—to which truth compels me—
I limit myself to nodding assent, when he invariably returns, "Ah,
I '11 have ye plazed by ye get to Glengar'ff."
He says this as though all the credit of showing me the variations
ot scenery was due to nis own private and particular pre-arrange-
ments. Were it possible for him to have taken me any other way
which might have been less attractive than this route, of course I
should have been under some obligation to him, but as this is the
only road between Killarney and Glengariff that a tourist can take,
no praise .whatever is due to ME. O'SHAUGHNESSY for having
selected it.
"I '11 have ye plazed, Sorr, by ye get to Glengar'ff," he mutters
to himself.
More beautiful views. In fact, one would be glad of a rest in a
close by-street, as, throughout this short tour, there is a perfect
surfeit of Nature's Beauties. Through weird tunnels cut in the
rocks, facing a biting north-east wind, up-hill quickly and down-
hill surely, and ME. O'SHAUGHJTESSY, my driver, in ecstasies with
everything, as if he were seeing it for the first time; and all this
simply out of politeness to me!
To any remark of mine which'may"meet with his approbation, he
replies,
tl That's a fact! You 're right there, Sir 1 You 're right there!
That's a fact!"
And then he invariably winds up with what comes at last to he a
sort of refrain to every verse of his limited conversation,
"I '11 have ye plazed by ye get to Glengar'ff."
After the tunnel hewn throxigh the rock there is a gradual descent,
with Glengariff vale stretching out before me, and the previous
wildness and sterility of the country is softened off by pasturage,
homesteads among the trees reminding me of parts of Sussex, the
country deepening in wood and water as it stretches out towards
Bantry Bay, which I can hardly believe to be the sea, so hemmed
in does it appear by points of land, and cut up into islands.
Glengariff. — Eccles Hotel. Charmingly situated. Facing the
hay, and on the road. Old-fashioned, covered with creepers and
roses, and bedrooms commanding the bay.
Happy Thought.—WereJ a Turkish traveller of distinction to
arrive, it would be, "The Bey commanding the bedrooms." The
Landlady genial and hospitable.
"Thii it the place !—stand still my steed!"
as the song gays.
"Well, this t« a pretty place!" I cannot help exclaiming, as I
descend from my triumphal car.
MB. O'SHAUOHNESSY is beaming.
"Didn't Itouldye so, yer Honour? Didn't I say I'd have ye
plazed by ye got to Glengar'ff?" he asks, with conscious pride, as

ME. O'SHATJGHNESSY is for making himself of considerable importance, as
long as my eye is on him, on the threshold of the hotel; but here he meets his
match, and more, in the person of a comely, elderly lady, evidently the Hostess
and Manageress of the establishment, who sees the situation at half a glance,
and becomes at once the Hostess to me, and the Manageress to MK. O'SnAuon-
ITESSY, from whom she will stand no nonsense of any sort. He wishes to take
upon himself to explain what /want as to dinner, as to sleeping accommoda-
tion, and specially as to being called very early in the morning, so as to
continue my drive, with him, to my next point.
But the Landlady knows as much about it as does MB. 0'SniUGHNESSY. Her
eye kindles.
"The Gentleman will be called in plenty of time, MB. O'SHATTGHNESSY." says
the Landlady, in a tone that nearly mak«» my hair stand on end. who am
placidly listening, quite ready to take the part of authority against O'SnArGH-
NESSY (who has been only an unamusing bore during the long drive, and to
whose company I have to look forward to-morrow), who begins to apologise in a
semi-important tone for his interference. This the Landlady will not stand.
MB. O'bHAUGHNESSY will ju»t oblige hsr by "getting out," which MB.
O'SHAUGHNESSY immediately does, acting clearly upon some previous experience.
I notice that there is a hulking "boots" and an ostler to match by the door, so
that MB. O'SHAUGHNESSY'S retreat is on the whole a prudent measure.
Eecles Hotel, Glengariff, is worth far more than a passing visit. I am
delighted with it. It is, as far as attendance and cuisine, and general comfort,
the best hotel 1 've been in. And it comes just exactly when it is wanted, i.e.
after a long tiring day's journey. The coffee-room seems to have been fitted up
to the very latest fashion of taste; and, can I believe my eyes, there are fish-
knives!
0 Rathdrum, the primitive! 0 Glendalough, loveliest of the lovely, but full
of imperfections as to thy Hotel comforts! 0 Woodsnbridge the cheerless! 0 any
other Hostelrie, aye, even the Victoria of Killarney, good
as ye are, slip out to the Eccles at Glengariff, and
take a lesson from Hostess, Cook, and Waiter. I pro-
test that for the first time on my travels I have dined
as a good Clubbable Christian of modest requirements
and temperate habits. The dinner is good, and it is so
well served. The Waiter is not an Irishman, but a
Dane. He is not a bit like Hamlet, and neither solilo-
quises, which would be inconvenient, nor joins in the
conversation, which would be objectionable. After
dinner—the climate is so mild—bless me, it's the first
time I 'vo been out of an east wind—that even at nine
o'clock on an early Spring evening you can sit out in
front of the hotel, and enjoy your coftee and cigar.
And oh! isn't this eulogy characteristic of the Saxon
sensualist, who goes into ecstasies over the place that
gives him the best dinner!
Happy Thought (Saxonly adapted). — " He loveth
best, who feedeth best, on bird, and fish, and beast."—
Vide Ancient Mnrim-r.
I am pressed for time, and have paid beforehand at
Killarney for the pleasure of MR. O'SHAuanui ~s\ \
society, or I would remain here two or three days. But
fiu rernir.
Otf again! MR. O'SHAUGHNESSY at the door at nine
A.M. I ascertain on good authority why he wanted me
to start at about five in the morning for Dunmanway.
It is because he wanted to have the day before him to
get back again.
And here also I will introduce a useful piece of advice
for the Tourist who may be passing the same route us
myself. Only hire your car from Killarney to Glvngariff.
tou can get another at your own convenience, and just
us good at Glengariff, to take you on to Dutimanway.
And one word more in vour ear, my friend, which
put down in your Happy Thought note-book, with my
compliments :—Don't come this way at all. Reverse it.
Go from Dublin to Cork, from Cork to Dunmanway,
from Dunmanway by car to Glengariff (don't attempt
any stopping at Inchigeelagh—not worth more than an
hour's delay); stay at Glengariff, and then on to Kil-
larney, taking The Tore and Muckross nn the way.
Here s your Itinerarium, and you '11 find it correct.
To slightly alter MB. O'SnAUoirKEtssY's refrain, "I'll
have ye plazed by ye get to Killarney!"
For you'll have journeyed by degrees of comparison,
and you'll finish (in the direction I mean) with the best.
On to Inchigeelagh. — On our route I notice the
prettiest girls I have yet seen in Ireland among the
peasantry. All bareheaded, and the poorest barefooted.
All wearing bright-patterned shawls, red petticoats—
invariably something bright. "Winning smiles, modest
eyes, and lovely teeth. These are their characteristics
everywhere. Strange to say, that of the type which I
have hitherto read of as the common one, I have only
met with rare instances. This may happen to be my
luck. If so, I must try again.
TheWomenpeat-carriers are very picturesque, carrying
the brown bricks in baskets, on their shoulders, to their
cabins across the mountains. A figure of one of them
would make an admirable match-box.
Happy Thought.—I have driven upwards of two
hundred and fifty miles on a car, and not met one single
beggar, except at Killarney, on the regular tourists'
route, where the professionals are. Yet I was told that
Ireland was the country par excellence for beggars. Per-
haps I am out of the season.
At the country inns (which do not pretend to be hotels)
I '11 back them for doing potatoes in their jackets, over
a peat fire, against any cooks in the world; occasionally,
too, for broiling a chop.
Nearing Macroom I notice the girls wearing a darkish
blue cloak and hood, and brown petticoats. The fashion
seems to be divided pretty equally between bare legs (most
symmetrical) and bare feet, or, on the other hand (I
should say on the other feet), grey stockings, with neat,
but substantial boots.
At Macroom. Happy Thought.—If ballads of the
day go for anything in Ireland, the name of Macroom
suggests that something might be done in this place
with the present popular ditty of " Tommy, Mac-room
for your Uncle." After this, the sooner I 'm away from
Macroom the better. Here's the train; that s the
ticket! Off to Cork! And then, as sensationalist novel-
writers put at the heading of the last chapter but sixteen,
this is if The Beginning of the End."

[Charles has not yet touched a morsel, but his Fair Companion is coming doom to supper for
the Third lime. L'.t us hope she takes the hint.
SPIRIT DUTIES.
As THEY WERE.
THE duties of Spirits in days gone by
Were useless jjet onerous ones, no doubt,
Such as frightening timorous folks on the sly,
And dragging huge chains about.
Their role was to ramble old mansions through,
In darkness of night, and sheet or shroud;
Make candles to burn of a bogeyish blue,
And watchers to shriek aloud!
They 'd to play bo-peep in Churchyards dank,
At witching and wholly unholy hours,
And clamour, and clatter, and croak, and clank,
In tumble-down turrets and tow'rs.
To worry the wainscots, and fret the floors,
Their unseen feet pattered about:
And they rattled the windows, and banged the doors,
And the lights with their breath put ont!
They set all our property-rights at nought
By tenancies horrid and undesired;
Hid treasures and missing wills they sought,—
Popping up when least desired.
Complete inutihty, worry, and fuss,
Appeared to be ever their favourite line:
And why the mischief they carried on thus,
No mortal could e'er divine!
As THEY ABE.
But the Spirits seem now on another "lay,"—
And more lucrative business boast:
How the modish " Shade " of the modern day-
Must look down on your good old Ghost!
Now Spirit " duties" take wider range,
And the Spectres smart of the latter-day school
Have intimate dealings,—a notable change,—
With the knave as well as the fool.
"With "properties " furnished by HOME or SLADE,
For patrons the Gooseherds of Gullibility,
Their role as ever,—though deftlier played,
Is "General/nutility."
To tapping of tables from turning of hats—
As well as the heads of the boobies who wore them,—
They 've ris'n, and to fleecing from frightening flats,
As the old Ghosts did before them.
They scribble bosh on a doctored slate—
Under tables of conjurors' model—
And vent, in the name of the dead-and-gone great,
Most ungrammatical twaddle.
In fine,—and your honest old Ghosts it grieves
To see their degenerate race's disaster,—
The Spirits have fallen among the thieves,
With Jeremy Diddler for master.
Alas, poor Ghosts! 'Tis a Nemesis stern
For the mischievous cantrips you formerly played:
How a Spirit of spirit must spurn
The bondage of " AXLIE " or SLADE!
Should the Ghosts provoke Law's clutches stern,
Or defy sharp Science's sham-detectors,
The bull s-eye must beam for the blue light's gleam,
Till the Spectres succumb to the Inspectors.
CALLED TO THE HELM.
OBSERVERS have remarked on the departure of the Cardinal of
Westminster for Borne so closely on the death of CARDINAL
AXTONKI.LI. No wonder, after such a loss, that the Pilot of the
Barque of St. Peter should feel that it wants MANNING.

ANYPOBT'S. Time
—Sunday morn-
ing. MRS. and the
MISSKS ANYPORT
and the COLONEL
seated.
Mrs. Any-port
(finishing the wing
of a partridge]. Of
course, the Colonel
does not go to
Church to-day (se-
verely) as usual?
Colonel. As
usual, my dear.
There 's no one
•who thinks more
about the religious
practices of his
country than I do
But it s damp this
morning, and
fancied I felt
twinge in 'my left
toe, and
Miss Anyvort. And Papa would rather stay at home.
Mrt. Any port. Well, dears, we must be charitable. (To the
Colonel.) So you won't come. "Well, we can pray for you.
[Mas. ANTPOBT sails out of the room preceded by her daughters,
likela ship with tiro tugs. As they go up-stairs,
Lizzie Anyport (in a whisper). Is CAPTAIN CAVENDISH coming to
our pew this morning?
Miss Ant/port. Why. of course he is. You don't suppose lie
forgets to go to Church?
Lizzie. When you are there—oh dear no!
Miss Anyport. Well, you know when CHARLIE PALK is near us,
I 'm sure.
Mrs. Anyport. And, my dear girls, do hold yourselves up in
Church. People will think you quite dumpy. Oh! and LI/ZIE
darling, just look at LADY SWELLSON'S bonnet, and fix it in your
head. Be quick now. I shall not wait for you.
MRS. ANYPORT is first off, and arrives just in time to confess, ''She
has done what she ought to have done, and left undone what
she ought not to have done." This she does with her nose in the
air, her eyes closed, and a lace handkerchief between her folded
hands; accompanied by a gentle waff of the cherries in her
bonnet, which impresses her neighbours extremely.
The girls arrive rustling and clattering with, all sorts of silver baubles
hanging to their sides, eminently useful in a choral service, in
the middle of the Psalms. They are not at all nervous, but
shake hands with CAPTAIN CAVENDISH, and even send a reli-
gious recognition to CHABLEE PALK in the pew behind.
Miss ANYPORT, who is a pupil of SIGNOR CIAITO (the great CIAFFO)
instantly launches into the responses at least a semitone flat,
LIZZIE ANYPORT inspects a line scribbled in pencil on the flyleaj
of a hymn-book which has been passed to her by CHARLIE PALK
Change. The Colonel's smoking-room. The Colonel has nearly
devoured the Observer, the Army and Navy Gazette, and the
illustrated papers, besides two enormous cabanas, and is dozing
happily in his arm-chair, when the girls and their mother re
turn, redolent of silks and satchets, to bring him back to reality
Lizzie. 0 Papa dear! my altar-cloth looked so lovely—simplj
gorgeous.
Miss Ant/port. Awfully sweet! But Papa dear! you should hav
seen the Fox GUYS, what dresses they wore. Quite a caricature.
Mrs. Anyport. Such a sermon, Colonel, it would have done yo
good. Apropos! LIZZIE, I wonder what Brillantine it is DR. APSE
PYX uses: it shone like a halo when he gave out the text. A swee
sermon indeed!
[MRS. ANYPORT shakes her cherries again, but for the life oj
her cannot remember—what the text teas. The sermon tea
for a wonder very*good, being one of DOCTOR ARNOLD'S own
Miss A nyport. How awfully badly poor Miss SWELLSON sings
She reall y might leave the chants to us and the choristers. Tha
cuirass she wore was made out of last year's dinner-dress.
Lizzie. So it was! I was thinking all Second Lesson where I ha
seen it before.
Miss Anyport. I knew it at once. 0 Papa dear, we have brought
APTAIN CAVENDISH back to lunch.
Mrs. Anyport. That reminds me, Lizzra dear, I do not think
UAELES PALK a good parti, so don't go on, I beg.
Colonel Anyport (aside}. Confound it! Hang that supercilious
lunger! He smokes all my best cigars, and looks as if / liked it.
Mrs. Anyport. And don't forget, JOHN, DR. APSEY PYX thinks
re should do best to pass our spare hours on Sunday in meditation.
Miss Anyport. Yes, Mamma, dear, and don't forget CAPTAIN
'AVENDISH takes us to the Zoo this afternoon.
Mrs. Anyport. I should prefer Hurlingham if I had been asked,
ut no matter. [Exeunt all to Lunch.
WHO'S ZOO IN THE CITY?
ON account of the success attained by the introduction of the
"lephants in the Lord Mayor's Show on the ninth instant, it is highly
robable that the idea may be further developed on future Ninths
f November. Mr. Punch, always glad to assist his Right Honour-
hie friend at the Mansion House, begs to present the Coming Man
f 1877-78 with a rough sketch of what he believes would be a very
ffective order of procession :—
Policemen (with Serpents) to clear the way.
'he Fishmongers* Company carrying the contents of the Westminster
Aquarium.
Deputation from the Stock Exchange carried on Bears and Bulls.
The City Marshal, with Peacocks in Attendance.
The Common Serjeant Riding a Hobby.
The Spectacle Makers' Company attended by Owls and Moles.
L Man in Armour mounted upon a Donkey clothed in a Lion's Skin.
Foresters from Epping..Forest carrying a Collection of
Stuffed Birds and Beasts.
Heralds in Tabards flanked by Hogs in Armour.
The Right-Honourable and Most Learned Mr. Toby.
Deputation from the Zoological Society, attended by any Animals
that can be spared from the Gardens.
A Provincial Menagerie
Supposed to represent "The Signing of Magna Charta," "The
Destruction of the Spanish Armada," and "The Passing
of the Reform Act of 1832 ").
The Court of Common Council.
Broeckman's Performing Do^s and Monkeys.
Aldermen with Swans hopping on one leg.
The Recorder of London, attended by Fishes out of Water.
Aldermen and Geese who have Passed the Chair.
A Band of Canaries, Piping-Bxillrinches, and Mocking-Birds.
The Arms of certain well-known Aldermen, supported by Donkeys,
Mules, and Apes.
The Lord Mayor's Coach, with the Lion of the Day outside drawing
the Lion of the Day in.
Policemen (with Scorpions) to keep the People b ack.
WILD BIRDS AND "VERMIN."
THE saying that " if the sky should fall larks would be caught,"
can hardly have been considered by " A LOVES OF BRITISH BIRDS,
who thus addresses the Times :—
"I write to protest through your omnipotent medium against the exhibitiol
„; larks as an article of food in poulterers' shops. I don't suppose any legis;
lation will stop the wholesale destruction of these national songsters, but.
trust that the national sentiment, if there is any sentiment left in moden
society, will be aroused and expressed against such a use of British singm|
>irds.
Larks are happily so numerous that there is no fear of their beinj
all eaten up by epicures. There is plenty of that sort of sentimen
which objects to any of them being eaten merely because they an
singing birds, left in modern society. It is sentiment such as tha
which, whilst denouncing scientific vivisection, silently allows eel;
to be skinned alive. If a lark pudding is really a good thing, I
LOVEK OF BEITISH BIRDS" will perhaps, if not learn to love then
as a pudding'i contents, at least, on second thought, reconsidt
what follows:—
"I may remind those who would like to shame those Tulgar enters c
Hearen's messengers that the EMPEEOR HELIOGABALUS was especial!
partial to the brains of singing birds, and I may suggest that they shoul
restrict themselves also to the brains of larks, as it must be that portion c
the bird they most reqaire."
Herein surely "A LOVER OF BRITISH BIRDS" is unreasonabl
hard upon other lovers of Briti»h birds who love their lark pure!
as they love their partridge or pheasant. Is not the partridge
British Bird as well as the lark, and has not the pheasant at leaf
been acclimatised? Have they not an equal claim to be loved wit

larks, as larks are loved by "A LOVER OF BRITISH BIRDS"?
Plumage is surely a merit as much demanding exemption from being
eaten as song. Some lover of birds, for the mere look of them, will
next perhaps propose—in the season when Parliament is shooting—
a Plea for the Pheasant, and the Partridge, against the Dealer in
Game.
There are other birds than larks, but unlike larks growing very
scarce, against whose total destruction it is much to be wished that
"any sentiment left in modern society" should, by all means, "be
aroused and expressed." Eagles, falcons, hawks, kites, buzzards,
hen-harriers, have been almost all of them improved off the face of
the country by pot-hunting landed poulterers. There is hardly a
raven anywhere to be seen, and for a young one in a cage the other
day a bird-fancier asked one of Mr. Punch's young men half a
guinea. Of course birds of prey should be kept under: but what a
shame to exterminate them! Their extirpation has despoiled the
landscape of living ornaments. It has been a destruction of things
of beauty which ought to have been preserved to be joys for ever.
Is not this a barbarity which every genuine Lover of British Birds
must deplore, and denounce, and endeavour, if possible and not too
late, to get repaired?
CHIPS FROM THE ADVERTISEMENT COLUMN.
THIS remarkably cool offer lately appeared in the Islington
Gazette .—
A Good HOME offered to a clean-looking young Person, of respectable
family (of tradespeople preferred); must produce good references, and
be able to assist in the nursery; £6 per annum for clothing given. Apply
any morning at , &c. No fare allowed unless engaged.
And the following from that organ of the Clergy the Guardian,
gives one a pleasant idea of the advertiser:—
WANTED, by a Widow Lady, a PERSON who is experienced in the
art of Whipping, and well qualified to administer a severe Flogging
with a new birch rod to two young children of the ages of nine and ten. Wages
£30 per annum. The children are Terr wilful and troublesome. Address, &c.
However, £30 a year for a Flogger is handsome compared with
£20 a year for a Governess—a very common salary.
The next, from the Field, is, in some respects, mysterious:—
WANTED, a tall UNDER BUTLER, with long recommendations,
where four men are kept, and the family go to London in the season;
wages £30 to £35.—Apply, &c.
Can "recommendations," like "continuations," be a euphemism
for any part of a Footman's clothing 'i The two words can't mean
the same thing, or the epithet would rather, one would think, be
"short" than "long": —
What a chance is here for Coelebs in search of a "Wife!—
A WIDOW LADY and her Sister (both musical), living in a large
well-furnished house, wish to receive one more GENTLEMAN to join
their small circle. Late dinner. No clerks need reply.—IDA. &c., &c.
"IDA." the name of TENNYSON'S Princess! Sweetly suggestive!
And a Widow," too—with sorrows to sympathise in, and tears to
wipe away! The other sister—a gusher too, probably—both musical
—dear delightful creatures, with voices soft and low, we will be
bound; that "excellent thing in woman"! "Man-traps set on
these premises." Bachelors, beware!
This appeared in the Standard of the day before Gny Fawkes's
festive and fireworky anniversary:—
STRICT DISCIPLINE.—A Gentleman in the country desires to secure
the services of a thoroughly qualified GOVERNESS to teach French,
Italian, Drawing, and Music. No one need apply who objects to judicious
corporal punishment.
A pleasant sort of man this Country Gentleman must be, and his
family, no doubt, must be extremely fond of him. To judge from
his advertisement, there seems to be small fear that bos children
will be spoilt by such an injudicious sparing of the rod as is prover-
bial. We wonder if he gives them their chastisement himself, or
expects their governess to act as flogger for him. Mri. Squeeri or
Sully Brass perhaps might suit this situation: but we doubt if the
advertisement is likely to prove attractive to an educated lady.

THE PARSONS' PLAY.
AT the Theatre Ecclesiastical, St. Ve-
dast's, Foster Lane, Cheapside, the Ritu-
alist adaptation of Mais, was performed
as usual on Sunday last week, notwith-
standing the inhibition of the Court of
Arches. A notice of the performance has
appeared in the Morning Post, whence are
derived the following particulars. The part
of Pontifex was sustained hy the REV. T.
P. DALE with his accustomed ability; and
the REV. MR. ARMITAGE played a good
second. The former gentleman was habited
"in a cloth of gold cope, such as is worn
by Roman Catholic Priests at Benediction,
having in the back a crimson velvet fall,
having on it a gold embroidered cross. Mu.
ARMITAGE wore a white vestment, both
clergymen having on their heads the
'biretta.'" Their get-up appears to have
been very good; and there was introduced
a change of costume. "Mil. DALE, having
retired to the sacristy, came back to the altar
clothed in a chasuble, the same as that
worn by the priest at Low Mass." In the
adaptation of Matt to the British clerical
stage. Low Mass appears to be combined
with High Mass, much as COLLET GIBBER
pieced together portions of Henry the Sixth
and his own composition with Richard the
Third. A procession of "acolytes " to the
altar, bearing aloft a cross, with "two tall
ornamented candles," and headed by a
"thurifer" swinging a "thurible." and
scattering incense, told very effectively, and
looked very much like the real things, the
representation altogether bearing a strong
resemblance to the original, although the
libretto was sung and spoken in English
instead of Latin, and with considerable
variations from the Roman text.
It was understood to have been given out
from the pulpit that, irrespectively of law,
the performance would be repeated till
further notice, but there appears to be some
doubt whether this course will be persisted in.
If it is, will the BISHOP OF LONDON inter-
fere? Perhaps he cannot if he would.
Another authority, however, possibly can,
and will. The performances at St. Vedast's,
one would think, must surely be within the
jurisdiction of the LORD CHAMBERLAIN.
THE LATEST NEWS.
(From our own Correspondent.)
CONSTANTINOPLE, Monday.
You will be glad to learn that everything is now as gooa as
settled. Russia nas withdrawn all her awkward demands and the
influence of England (supported as she is by Austria and Germany)
is all-powerful. SIR HENRY ELLIOT has submitted a scheme to the
Porte, which is now under consideration.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Tuesday.
You will not be surprised to hear after receiving my dispatch of
yesterday's date that we are on the eve of a great European war.
Russia (supported by Germany and Austria) insists that what she
demands shall be granted within four-and-twenty hours. I may add
that the scheme submitted yesterday by SIR HENRY ELLIOT to the
Porte has been withdrawn, at the instigation of LORD SALISBURY.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Wednesday.
As I hinted to you yesterday, Russia is checkmated. The stub-
born resistance of France and Italy to her claims, and the moral
support of England, given to the combined policy of Austria and
Germany, have had their due effect. SIR HENRY ELLIOT has sub-
mitted a scheme to the Russian Ambassador, which is now said to be
undergoing consideration.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Thursday.
From the tone of my yesterday's despatch you will be prepared to
learn that Europe 'is threatened at this moment with one of the
greatest calamities that could possibly happen to her. The alliance,
offensive and defensive, between Russia, France, Austria, and Italy
(at which I hinted yesterday), is causing the most hopeless complica-
tions. I may add that SIB HENRY ELLIOT'S scheme submitted to
Russia yesterday has been withdrawn, at the instigation of LORD
SALISBURY.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Friday.
After my yesterday's despatch it will scarcely be news for you to
hear that Russia has sent an ultimatum to Paris, Yienna, and I tome.
England has offered to arbitrate between the quarrelling Powers, but
unhappily the feeling of animosity, which is accountable for Russia's
strange conduct, is of many years' standing. SIR HENRY ELLIOT
has submitted schemes to the Representatives of Germany, Austria,
Switzerland, France, and Spain.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Saturday.
From the tenor of my yesterday's remarks, you will have
guessed that Russia has withdrawn all her demands, and is now the
Turk's best friend. The International Banquet (to which I alluded
in my last dispatch), was a great success. The healths of the QUEEN
OF ENGLAND, the EMPEROR OF AUSTRIA, the KING OF ITALY, and the
PRESIDENT OF THE FRENCH REPUBLIC, were proposed in most
affectionate terms by the Russian host. There is no other news
except that the schemes submitted yesterday by SIR HENRY ELLIOT
to the Representatives of Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland,
France, and Spain, have been withdrawn at the instigation of LORD
SALISBURY.

No. 4.— PNEr/MATIC-DBBPATCH-FoX-HUNTIHO COMPANY (LIMITED).
GRACEFUL ACT OF A LADY.
PERSONS with plenty of money,
and no poor relations to assist or
an aged mother to support, will
perhaps put their hands in their
pockets and pull out something
tor a laudable purpose when they
learn that the Byron Monument
Committee has not yet received
subscriptions to an amount nearly
large enough to defray the cost of
a statue at all worthy of BIRON'S
fame. The best of the designs
sent in to them for selection is
said to be the work of "a very
distinguished American sculptor,
who can use his pen as ably as his
chisel." It is remarkable that an
American artist and man of letters
should offer help to perpetuate
BYRON'S fame, whereas a country-
woman of his, a Lady of name
in literature, endeavoured a few
years ago, with all her ability, to
perpetuate just the reverse. She
acted, no doubt, from a righteous
indignation under a wrong idea,
and now, perhaps, having hap-
pily found out her mistake, will
be glad to repair it as much as
she can. Would it surprise you,
then, to hear that MHS. HARRIET
BEECHES STOWE had sent in a
subscription towards making up

THE FIGHT FOR PLUMSTEAD COMMON.
FROM the following piece of last Monday week's news it appears
that the HOME SECRETARY knows how to revise the judgments of
the Great Unpaid :—•
"Yesterday morning an official communication -was received at the Kent
County Gaol from the HOME SECRETARY, stating that HER MAJESTY had
been graciously pleased to remit the fine and remainder of the sentence passed
on MB. JOHN DE MORGAN, at the last Kent Quarter Sessions, for complicity
in the Plumstead Common riots. In the ordinary course of things he would
have been discharged this morning, but the letter was succeeded by a telegram
stating that DE MORGAN was to be liberated at once, it being the first instance
for fifteen years of a prisoner being discharged from the gaol on a Sunday."
The so-called riots on Plumstead Common were of quite a different
nature from the intimidation meetings held from time to time in
Hyde Park. They were merely forcible proceedings of resistance to
attempts at the enclosure of common land supposed illegal. The
Kent Justices decided them to be riots. Technically, perhaps, they
were. The more the pity. Everybody interested in the preserva-
tion of open spaces, that is, all people except a few grasping, greedy,
selfish, and sordid churls, would nave been glad to learn that the
alleged riots were no riots, and that the repetition of them would
have been no rioting—if such were really the law. There are
few sights more calculated to delight a well constituted mind than
the view of a bonfire made of fences illegally set up on a Common
by a Lord of the Manor, and legally torn down by the aggrieved
neighbours. The greatest credit is duo to anyone who nas the
spirit to lead a multitude on to the lawful demolition of unlawful
enclosures. Provided always, of course, that the enclosures are
really unlawful, and the demolition of them indeed lawful and
right. Otherwise, dear friends, the concourse demolishing them is
a riotous assembly, and the head man thereof a ringleader, in the
eye of the law. It is therefore, good people, very desirable that,
before you proceed to destroy fences by which you believe your-
selves robbed of your rights, you shoul'd consult lawyers, so as to
make quite sure that you are not mistaken in the supposition that
those rights have been invaded. For if there is any doubt upon
this point it is not you who will get the benefit of the doubt at
Quarter Sessions, and, though a fine may be remitted altogether,
imprisonment, of which you will possibly be let in for more or less
before being let off the remainder, is a bore.

A SHADE ON PROGRESS.
I AM what was a 'Squire of ancient line;
This Manor-house, and Manor once were mine.
Here in my time I kept a pack of hounds;
And my whole heart was in my house and grounds.
Still to this dear old place in death I cleave;
My home, though left behind, I cannot leave.
No better place I knew, nor do I know:
Here I remain, iinable hence to go.
I bear the semblance of the garb I bore,
Such in time past as England's gentry wore.
Ton picture which appears from out its frame
On point of stepping down, reveals my name.
Mine were the days ere Trade had all o'ergrown;
When they who held the land could hold their own.
No Company durst private grounds invade,
And aggravate their sometime owner's shade.
With scorn and anger thus I 'm forced to mark
A Railway cutting my ancestral Park;
Crossing the Avenue of elm-trees old,
Where once the family Coach serenely rolled.
Now telegrams and signals vex my sight:
Annoyed by coloured lamps I walk the night.
And every train brings crowds of Cockneys down,
Profaning the still scenes I haunt, from Town.
These rushing Railways, on whose borders spring
New stucco'd villas, populations bring
For beef and mutton swelling the demand,
Raising the price of meat on every hand.
Hence oysters soon will cost as much or more,
As though a pearl inside each oyster wore;
All shellfish rise beyond poor purses' pale.
E'en crabs and lobsters have begun to fail.
A dozen prawns to one-and-sixpence reach,
Shrimps, doubtless, will be soon a penny each;
Good things are rising till extinct they fall:
Prosperity and Progress spoiling all!
Go on; consume; exhaust the Earth defaced;
And take no measures to repair your waste.
Use up the produce of the land and sea,
Until all "s gone—revenge in store for me!
TIME'S TRACKERS-OLD AND NEW.
"How noiseless falls the foot of Time,
That only falls on flowers."
AND never before was such a flowery carpet arranged for Time's
gouty old feet to fall on as now-a-days, with DF.LARUE and MARCUS
WABD blossoming into floral calendars, and cards bright with
blossoms, and posies of song as well as chlorophyll. As natural
flowers are hardest to come by in winter, these art-gardeners wisely
take care to have their parterres in lushest and brighest bearing about
Christmas-tide. We have among their productions even cards that,
besides their flowers, hear double acrostics! The old sun-dials broke
out at most into aphorisms. And much as an aphorism to a double
acrostic is a sun-dial to a DELABUE'S Card-Calendar—more solid,
doubtless, but infinitely less showy, while the card has the great
advantage over the dial, for England, that it is independent of the
sunshine.

THE TOO COMPLETE LETTER-WRITER.

the last two months ME. GLADSTONE has been employing
the time he is able to spare from public speaking and tree-felling to
the answering of a very miscellaneous collection of correspondents.
His replies have ranged from Bulgarian outrages up to Vaccination
grievances. Always ready to oblige a fellow-litterateur, Mr.
Punch begs to supply the ex-Premier with a few ready-made
responses, founded upon MR. GLADSTONE'S well-known style, and
in sympathy with his published opinions:—
Reply to a Conscientious Doubter.
SIB,—Tour touching and deeply interesting acknowledgment of
doubts as to the principle of gravitation the soundness of KEPLER'S
laws, the Newtonian system generally, and even so generally ac-
cepted a doctrine as that of the sphericity of our globe, are before
me. Without committing myself to tin endorsement of your particular grounds of scepticism on those points, most of which are
lazily taken for granted t>y ordinary minds with as little inquiry into, as appreciation of the scientific grounds on which they are
maintained, I may be allowed, to express my genuine sympathy with doubts which do as much credit to your head as to your heart.
I am not one of those who find it easier to tolerate the hardness of the one than the softness of the other. All candid and honest
inquirers have my profound respect; and I am flattered by being made the recipient of your doubts, if my numerous avocations do
not just now leave me the leisure to weigh, still less to resolve them. Yours very faithfully, W. E. GLADSTONE.
Reply to a would-be Suicide.
Bra,—In your interesting communication (which I now acknowledge) you ask me " if I consider suicide justifiable?" This is a
wide question, both from the'moral.'political, and social point of view, and cannot be answered off-hand. Still, I must admit I
regard with suspicion the operation of any law interfering with the liberty of the subject on this or any other point, and should be
ready to consider any relaxation of its provisions which now operate in restraint of the/eto cle se. j am £Cj
"W. E. GLADSTOITE.
Reply to a Firm of Wine Merchants.
MB. GLADSTONE presents his compliments to MESSBS. FUSIL, FUCHSINE & Co.,'and begs to say that he has not had the time nor the
inclination to test the samples submitted to him. Port is not one of Ma. GLADSTONE'S favourite wines. He is therefore unable to say
whether the pint bottles that have been forwarded to him contain a liquor "infinitely less heady and immeasurably more fruity than
the concoction known as 'fine old Tory Port.'" MB. GLADSTONE must add, however, that, without any wish to convert the matter
into a party question, he'can, from his present point of view, consider nothing Tory either useful or ornamental.

A TELEGBAM from Rome mentions that:—
"A meeting of influential Catholics from different Italian
cities has been held at Mauseoa, to consider the best means of
celebrating the Anniversary of Canossa, on the 25th of January
next."
Considering that the relative positions of the two
principal actors in the Canossa affair are now nearly
reversed, perhaps, the best way of celebrating the An-
niversary of Canossa would be, if possible, to get the
EMPEEOK WILLIAM to come there, and the POPE to go
and!meet him; POPE and EMPEHOE exchanging their
respective parts, his Holiness knocking under, as HENRY
TIIE FOURTH of Germany, and HENRY s present successor
bullying the POPE, as HILDEBRAND. The Holy Father
likes a joke, and if he sees the fun of this proposal, let us
hope that his health and strength will continue such as to
enable him if he pleases, to go to Canossa and act, mutatis
mutandis as above suggested, on the 25th of January.

Reply to the Editor of a Magazine,
DEAR SIB,
YOUR letter asking me to contribute an article to your
excellent periodical reached me this morning, and I hasten to reply
to it. My present engagements are rather numerous, as I have
already sixteen pamphlets and fourteen articles on the stocks. Still,
as I notice an anonymous letter has been published in the Pimlico
Pump (a suburban paper, I understand) which, in my opinion,
reflects upon my style as an author, I shall only bo too glad to have
an opportunity of answering the nameless scribbler through the
columns of your admirably conducted magazine. The space I
shall require will be from fifty-five to fifty-seven pages.
Yours sincerely,
W. E. GLADSTONE.
Reply to an Old Lady.
DEAR MADAM,
OF my own knowledge I cannot say whether the blood-
thirsty Turks ate their Servian victims with salt and pepper or
preferred them without any condiment. In my pamphlets (which
may be obtained of any respectable newsvendor in town or country)
I hive entered largely into the question of Bulgarian horrors. In
the meanwhile I am happy to think that millions of my countrymen
(like yon) hold LORD BEACONSFIELD personally responsible for every
act of Russian aggression, Servian submission, and Turkish ter-
rorism which has been reported during the last two centuries and
a half- Yours very faithfully,
W. E. GLADSTONE.
And here Mr. Punch stops. Probably before these lines are in
print some of the above letters may, in effect, have already been
written by the pen of the far too ready writer. Of a verity tie pen
is a more dangerous weapon than the sword. The glory of many a
gallant general has evaporated in gunpowder smoke; but here we
have a great statesman deliberately drowning a splendid reputation
in that most to be let alone of wells—an inkstand!

MR. PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
NOTICE

ECTION VI.—CON-
CERNING THE
CHOICE OF A
REGIMENT.
WHEN Mr.
Punch resumed
his place in the
ante-room, a
"crisis" had oc-
curred in the
affairs of Europe,
and all his pupils
•were more or less
excited. COLONEL
CHABLES, of the
Royal East Mud-
borough Militia,
was in full lerfe
uniform, with
silver belt, silver
sash, and silver-
laced overalls
complete. ENSIGN
EUGENE, of the
Volunteers, had
extracted the rail-
way map of Eng-
land and Scotland
out of Brad-
shaw's Guide, and
was studying the
coast attentively.
LIEUTENANT AND
CAPTAIN GEORGE, of the Grenadiers (Green), had caused his hair
to be cut and his whiskers to be trimmed according to the
regulations, and looked quite like a soldier. And even dear little
FIELD-MARSHAL Sra FRANK GEEGEE, K.C.B., had purchased a
hand-hook to military tactics, and was reading a chapter (through
his spectacles) devoted to the consideration of regimental buttons.
"My dear pupils." said Mr. Punch, highly gratified at the
picture presented to his view of his scholars' industry, " I am much
pleased to see that you are ready for any emergency."
"Yes, Sir," exclaimed COLONEL CHARLES, of the Royal East
Mudborqugh Militia, kicking away his sword with his well-spurred
heel; "in our hands, Sir, Margate is perfectly safe."
"On behalf of our Riflemen," supplemented ENSIGN EUGENE, of
the Volunteers, "I think I may say the same of Lower Tooting."
"If we have to fight," drawled LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN GEORGE,
of the Grenadiers (Green). "I hope they will make a railway
between Constantinople and Monaco?'
"If there's a general conscription," lisped out dear little SIR
FRANK GEEGEE, "good little Sin FRANKY hopes they won't take the
Cook of the Senior United. Dear little Snt FRANKY is a good little
Englishman, but he likes a nice dinner."
"My dear pupils," replied Mr. Punch, "be under no apprehen-
sion. We all of us know that you are quite prepared to fight, but
you ought to have learned by this time that England does not
expend £25,000,000 a year upon the Soldiers of her Army with a
view to ever making any service of them. No, my dear friends,
rest in peace, and, if you can, pride yourselves on our national motto,
'Let's grin and bear it.'"
Seeing that his scholars were scarcely satisfied with this speech,
the Sage hastened to commence his Lecture :—
Part I. The Cavalry.—When a young man has gained a Com-
mission in the Army, he naturally quickly decides upon the branch
of the Service to which he wishes to belong. If he is fond o:
scientific soldiering, he will have passed through Woolwich, and wil
thus have become entitled to either the cocked hat of the Roya
Engineers or the rather top-heavy busby of the Royal Regiment o:
Artillery. Mr. Punch need not address himself to the Gunners anc
the Sappers, as they will be forced to choose for themselves. He con-
fines his remarks to those young gentlemen who make up their
minds to enter for the Cavalry or the Infantry. Say that a lac
prefers the mounted branch of the Service, then will he have tc
choose between the breast-plates of the 1st and 2nd Life Guard
and the Blues, the busbies of the Hussars, the shako of the Lancers
and the helmets of the Dragoons. To enable the young idea tc
shoot, _ or, rather, to ride, Mr. Punch jots down at random the
qualifications generally considered necessary to seourepopularity in
the various Regiments to which he has alluded. He may say a
once that service in the Cavalry is invariably more expensive than
vegetation in the Infantry.
The Household Cavalry.—An Officer should be fond of escor
.uty and keeping the streets. He should like London and Windsor,
and must be an adept in practical joking. Before joining he should
tudy " bear fighting " in all its branches. He must have plenty of
money, and know the laws of "Poker," "Ecarte," and "Whist."
le should be prepared to go to bed when the lark gets up, and to
fet up whenever stable duty calls him from his quarters. He should
lever forget what he owes to Society, and should bear in remem-
brance that the last time his regiment took to laurel-gathering was
more than half a century ago.
The Lancers.—An Officer should be clever at Circus-riding. If
IB can imitate a Clown in the Ring he will be indeed an acquisition
o the Regimental circle. He should be able to play upon a banjo,
and should have no objection to blacking his face. His library
should contain a copy of the works of the late JOE MILLER. If he
can ride a pony in a game of Polo, can sing a comic song with many
"spokens" in it. and can walk through the part of " Charles, his
Friend," creditably in Garrison amateur theatricals, he may expect
lis promotion to be at once rapid and certain.
The Hussars.—An Officer should be decidedly "horsey." His
mufti should be suggestive of the Jockev in private life, and if he
can train a few horses at Newmarket or Epsom, so much the better.
Be should be able to ride as a light-weight, and should have a
tieavy book upon the principal races. He should call his friends
"pals" and " chappys, and speak of himself as either a " warrior"
or a " noble sportsman."
The Dragoons.—An Officer should be rather heavy. He is at
liberty to cultivate popularity among the fair sex, by whom he
should be considered " such a charming fellow." Ponderous swag-
ger should be earnestly cultivated. When the funds of the Regi-
ment will permit of the dissipation, he should organise a Ball, at
which trophies of arms and mild flirtations should be the orders of
the day. He should get up a Regimental Drag, suggestive of
solemn dignity, and should indulge occasionally in a little gentle
fox-hunting.
Part II. The Infantry.—A youth who joins the Infantry has
perhaps less choice of "Rules of'Life" than his brother of the
Cavalry. However, even to him some variety is possible. The
regiments may be briefly divided into Guards, Rifle Brigade, High-
landers, Crack Corps generally, and Marching Regiments. It may
be taken as a general rule that the Cavalry will look down upon the
Infantry as " Flatfoots," and that the Infantry will speak contemp-
tuously (but perhaps—remember only perhaps—a little enviously)
of the Cavalry as "Light-bobs" and "Plungers."
The Guard!.—An Officer should be rich enough to regard his
Regimental pay as mere cigarette money. He should have a civil
but thorough disdain for the rest of the Service. He should wear
his nose well turned up in the direction of his bear-skin at all
Reviews. He should speak of soldiering as "a baw," and should
leave the Servic« at the very time when he is really becoming a
useful Regimental Officer.
The Rifle Brigade.—A shadow sketch of the Guards in dark green.
An officer should consider himself very much a soldier, but should
confess it difficult to understand " how fellows can possibly manage
to exist—in the line!"
The Highlanders.—An officer should have no ear for music. He
should for obvious reasons boast a presentable figure. He should
accustom himielf to the language of the Immortal Burns, and if
possible should avoid being an Irishman. When on furlough he
should live near a colony of pigs, so that he may remain acclimatised
to the sweet sound of the bagpipes.
Crack Corps Generally.—An officer should thoroughly under-
stand the meaning of the proverb "Amongst the blind the one-
ey e'd man is king. He should be particularly proud of his buttons,
and should carefully drop the numeral of his regiment in favour of
the county title. He should wear his uniform at county balls, and
whilst patting the militia condescendingly on the shoulder, should
utterly ignore the volunteers.
The Marching Regiment.—A. officer should never join unless he
happens to be a loldier at heart. If he it a soldier at heart he will
like his battalioa. And if he isn't—well he won't 1

the practice. "Bear fighting," my good Ensign (I am glad, by the
way. that you have retained an obsolete rank) means practical jokinf
of the most vulgar kind. A "bear tight" entails the smashing o:
the mess crockery, the tearing of uniforms, and the breaking o:

BROTHERS" AT THE COURT.
HILE MR. COGH-
LAN'S new play
is being as un-
duly cried down
as some other
recent plays have
been unduly
cried -up, Mr.
Punch is glad
to record his
humble opinion
that no Comedy
has been pro-
duced of late
years showing
more brightness
and smartness
in its dialogue,
and combining
with its bril-
liancy the needful
spice of humour
and character.
Then the good
things come na-
turally, and the
movement of the
scene is not
stopped to lug
them in. The "pruning-knife" may have been applied since the
first night, for when we saw the' play.last week it neither dragged
nor halted. Unhappily for himself and his work, the author has
run upon the most dangerous rock of the many in the way of the
English Dramatist. He has dealt too largely in cynicism, both in
the conception of his story and his characters, and as a consequence,
in the tone of the good things he has put into their mouths.
An English Comedy should reflect a corner, at least, of English
society; now, there may be corners in which cynicism is as much
in the ascendant as it is in MB. COGHLAN'S play, but the exhibition
of it will not please people who do not frequent these cynical corners.
It is a hundred to one that any average English audience represents
a larger section of English society than the playwright's own circle,
and by an average English audience cynicism is only tolerated as a
condiment, to be sparingly employed. They don't Kke to have the
taste of it in every plat of their entertainment.
MB. COGHLAN has made his younger brother a cynical Bohemian;
his elder brother a cynical Arcadian, who if he does a generous
thing usually says bitter ones—a sort of Grandcourt without the
steel claws under his velvet. Even Kate Hungerford has waded
too deep in the dirt of Bohemia, though she is anxious to get clear
of it. The paternal love of the old soldier-father and the dog-love
of Davenport, are not enough to supply the needful leaven of good
feeling for the British public, which Philistine as it may be, uncri-
tical and unanalytic as it unquestionably is, has sound instincts of
right and wrong, and will not let the dice of life be loaded, or the
worse made the better reason in matters of morale, without protest.
But the admirable way in which the piece is mounted and acted
should do a great deal to save it from the unpopularity to which its
cynicism may tend to condemn it. From first to last it is as well
acted as the most fastidious critic of acting could desire—as well
acted as a well-acted^comedy at the Theatre Franc.ais. If MB.
CONWAY would take something out of the more repulsive side of his
part, by showing us a little more of the better side of the Bohemian,
instead of throwing all the more repulsive points into stronger relief
by the hardness and defiance of his manner, we should find it diffi-
cult to suggest any improvement on the acting of Brothers. MB.
KELLY'S old Indian Colonel; MB. ANSON'S much-enduring Captain;
MB. HARE'S cynically spoken but kindly-hearted Baronet; Miss
ELLEN TEBBY'S graceful and pathetic picture of the incautious, ill-
trained, but, at bottom, loving and womanly, Kate Hungerford;
MBS. GASTON MUBBAY'S formidable widqw-of-the-world; and Miss
HOLUNGSKEAD'S bright and pleasant ingenue—all, down to MB-
CATHCABT'S discreet and demure family lawyer, and MB. LEIGH'S
irreproachable butler, are perfect in their several ways.
It is delightful to be able to point to two theatres in London—the
Prince of Wales's and the Court—in which may be seen, at the eauio
time, two comedies consummately acted, from the principal parts
to the most subordinate. But Peril is French plaque, and one feels
it. Brothers, with all its faults, is English all through.
When MB. COGHLAJT has learnt that he may, without gpody-
goodyism or conventionality, give to the better elements of life and
character in his play that pre-eminence over the baser which our
Society, with all its false estimates, on the whole secures to the

A PLAINTIVE APPEAL.
To MISTEB PUNCH: DEAR AND ONERD SIR,
SEEING as you It the frind of the Pore man I hope as you '11
take pitty upon im as now addresses you which I 'm a hinjured
indiwidual and so is my pal CHARLEY. We are both of us Pore
fellers wot tries to urn a onest living by our Hindustry leastways
the French Parisians they calls us Snevalleers of Hindustry cause
we lives by picking pockets and snchlike sorts of andicraft. Dear
Sir 'tis wefl beknown as how the Lor don't reckernize such industry
as ourn cause the Krushers are employed to clap us into Quod wen-
ever they can ketch us. Dear Sir we dont keer for the Krushers
leastways we dont so much complane of em for they aint mostly
oversharp not even the Detectives which they makes a pritty and of
unting up a ease and only seems to Hact when Hini'ermation 's guv
them.
Onerd Sir I dont mind telling you as its them scientific coves as
we are most afeard of—them chaps as keep hinventing of the blessed
Lectruck Telegrafs and other blooming hinstruments for bringing
Justice down on us. Dear Sir just you look at this ere wot is said
about Furtoggraphy as CHABLEY showed me tother evening in a
book which he diskivered in a covey's carpet-bag as he had collared
at a railway station—
"In some countries every person convicted of any crime is photographed,
and the record of his features becomes part of the archives of every prison.
Of course a hardened criminal, knowing the purpose for which his likeness is
being taken, is not a very manageable sitter."
Hi should think not indeed! Ardened criminal or not, a kiddy
would be precious soft to let em take his Foto agin his hinclination.
I know I *a see em blowed fust—but see dear Sir what appens—
"However no choice is given him • * * While he is being professedly
examined, the concealed photographer does his work."
Dear Sir that's jest what you'd expeck from them blooming
foring sneaks. Tis a part of their Spy system to steal sly looks at a
Cove and they ought to be had up for it and indited for obtaining of
his Portrait under false purtences. Next see dear Sir what follers—
"The system has been introduced into England, but only very partially.
It is to be regretted that the adoption of it has not been more general."
Dear Sir me and my pal CHABLEY we call it most Hunenglish to
use such Hartful dodges for to assist the Krushers. Hit aint fair
play we ses that they should take our Fotos while they wont let us
take theirs and even if we ad em they wouldnt be much good to us
cause them there low and hartful Detectives so disguises of their-
selves that their faces is as wariable as the colours of Cornelions.
Live and let live is our Motter and we ope dear onerd Sir as youll

SHOWS AND AUTRE CHOSE.
F course the Corpora-
tion of the City of Lon-
don is at this moment
in a ferment as to the
issue of the Russo-
Turk excitement. Not
a doubt ahout it, that
the only thought on
the other side of Tem-
ple Bar relates to war
and its prohahle expo-
nents.
You think so? You
are quite wrong. The
Aldermen and Sheriffs
are in a state of fer-
ment, it is true, which
is working into a very
good imitation of
frenzy, hut not for
Russian, nor for Turk;
neither on the CZAR'S
account, nor for LORD
BEACONSFIELD.
The fact is, since the
memorable entry of
LORD MAYOR SANGEH
— we apologise, we
mean LORD MAYOR
WHITE—with his .herd of elephants, there is hut one question asked in the
precincts of the Mansion House, "How is the Procession to be improved next
year?"
The only way will be to continue de plus fort en plus fort, after the immense
reception accorded by pit and gallery—wrong again, we meau by pavement
and balcony—to the Show of November, Seventy-Six.
When Mr. Punch gives advice he likes to be practical. He therefore
suggests the following programme of "Immense Effects and Stupendous
Novelties," which may be added one by one or en bloc as the purse of the new
Lord Mayor may suggest:—
The Sheriffs, in Roman Cars, drawn by three piebald horses abreast.
The retiring Lord Mayor, as the Courier of St. Petersburgh, driving six
horses in hand.
The Aldermen, on a platform drawn by trained turtles, as.the Bounding
Brothers of St. Botolph's.
The Common Councilmen on Donkeys, riding with their faces to the tail.
A Troupe of Guys (designed by the rejected candidates for the Byron Monu-
ment, and dressed by MESSRS. MAY & NATHAN), carried by members of the
Foresters' Societies in full canonicals^
A Tank on wheels, drawn by six Alligators and a Devil Fish, containing
the Directors and Managers of the Westminster Aquarium Company.
The Ladies and Gentlemen performing at night in the various Burlesques
of London, in the costumes worn in the different characters they repre-
sent. Marshalled by MR. LIONEL BROUGH, and escorted by MR. TOOLE on a
Rocking-Horse.
Sixteen Omnibuses, carrying outside the entire contents of MADAME
TTJSSATTD'S Exhibition—kindly lent for this occasion only.
An open Police-Van, containing the Ladies and Gentlemen from the Cham-
ber of Horrors.
Twenty-four London Watermen on Bicycles, led by MR. ROBERT LOWE in
full uniform, as the Captain of the Brompton Biciculars.
Band of Music of the Spheres, by the Members of the Psychological Society of
Great Britain, conducted by SERJEANT Cox. Banjo, Accordion, Concertina,
Fairy Bells, and Musical-Boxes.
The Cows from the various Dairies of the Metropolis, ridden by their
owners in sky-blue colours.
The City Marshal on a slack-wire from St. Paul's Cross to the Mansion
Honse.
And, lastly, the Lord Mayor, in a Pullman's Car. drawn by six Giraffes, three
Camels, two Zebras, and a donkey-engine, and escorted by a squadron of
Bashi-Bazouks, imported expressly for the occasion.
If that does not fetch the Public, the Corporation had better let the Elephants
slide from their memories, and return to a simpler and more tasteful pageant.
Rising to the Occasion.
AN elderly Subaltern of Marines recently prefaced a speech with the words
"I rise." A Captain of twenty-eight years' service, the christening of whose
great grandchild was the occasion of the festive gathering, interrupted his junior
with the remark—" Rise, Sir! You 're premature by a quarter of a century."

'ESSEX GREEN-BEARDBD NATIVE OYSTERS.—MR. FRANK
BUCKLAND writes in Land and Water:—" I am glad to in-
form the public that the green-bearded oysters native to the
River Roach (not far from Southend, Essex) are about to be
introduced into the London market. For over a hundred years
this kind of British oyster has been shipped t'iii Ostend to Paris
and Continental markets, where, under the name of' Les huitres
verts d'Ostende,' they have been and are considered a great deli-
cacy. The reason why oyster-eaters in England have not
hitherto availed themselves of these home-bred oysters is that
their beards— i.e., breathing gills—are in the winter months
more or less tinged with a green pigment. This peculiar green
is imparted to them by the sporulesof the seaweed called ' crow-
silk,' which grows abundantly in the Roach River. DR.
LETHEBY'S analysis has pronounced this pigment to be purely
vegetable, without the slightest trace of copper or other mineral.
I consider that this vegetable pigment imparts a peculiar taste
and delightful flavour to the meat of these plump little oysters.
For many years I have been trying to persuade the MESSRS.
J. AND F. WISEMAN, oyster merchants, of Pagleaham, Rochford,
Essex, to send their natives to the home markets. The present
scarcity of oysters has now induced them to supply the English
rather than the French markets. The shells are thin and por-
celain like, and the proportion of meat to shell in my catalogue
of oysters is one-fifth."—The Timet, November 1th.

Now why the,—but an Oyster must not swear;

We were content to dwell
In Ocean's deep unfathomed Caves for ever,

A Case for a Quiet Life.
THE Judges in the Supreme Court of Appeal the other
day had to decide on " a question of considerable interest
to the shipping and mercantile community," raised by
the case of Tiilly v. Howling. The point at issue in this
suit, one would suppose, must be interesting to the com-
munity at large. Everybody whose neighbour keeps an
ill-bred cur tied up, and who is therefore liable to be
kept awake all night, anyone who lives within earshot of
a ranting preacher, or of a platform whence demagogues
are accustomed to harangue public meetings, must be
concerned for the success of the great Roman Orators
namesake in an action by which, should he gain his
cause, it may he hoped that Howling will be silenced.

COKK is continental. It is the Irish Venice, or the Irish Amster-

FROM POTHOUSE TO PRISON.
A STATEMENT from the Bench at the Birmingham
Police Court signifies that MAJOR BOND, the Chief of
Police, has done some good service by enforcing the law
against drunkenness to the correction of offenders euphe-
mistically denominated "quiet drunkards," whom MB.
WRIGHT, the Magistrate, described as follows:—
"So far as the experience of the Bench went, they generally
found the quiet drunkard to be the man who had been (pending
the money belonging to the common fund of his family, sitting
for hours in a public-house, remaining there until he had lost
his reason and all control over himself, and then staggering
out of the house. He had to be avoided by women and children,
and if he went across the street it wns with imminent danger to
others and at the risk of his own life. Although he never uttered
a word, he was a nuisance and an obstruction to sober and sensible
people."
The quiet drunkard is, in short, a sot of the lethar-
gic species. Our plain-spoken forefathers, who called a
spade a spade, used likewise to call a sot a sot. It was
a simple word. Why not stick to their simplicity of
speech? By departure therefrom we may deviate into
inaccuracy. The capital description of a quiet drunkard
above-quoted was preceded by the remark that—
"Crime had increased so much of late that it had been the
means of more than filling the gaol, which had, at the present
time, 515 prisoners, and they had to borrow a larjte number of
cells in other gaols, Worcester and Warwick, in order to accom-
modate the surplus prisoners."
"Accommodated" is, as Justice Shallow observes,
"a good phrase" aptly applied; but, even in these
days of kindness to criminals, it is hardly usual exactly
to accommodate rogues and thieves or even drunkards,
however quiet, in gaol. On the contrary, imprisonment
is designed to incommode them, and doubtless does to a
very great extent, or else fails to answer its purpose.
But the prison accommodation, such accommodation as
it is, which the drunkards enjoy, cannot at present
be extended to others who deserve it at least as much
as themselves:—
"Mil. WRIOHT was not sure that the publican who, for hii
own profit, served the drunkard with glass after glass of spirits,
and jug after jug of ale, until he was bereft of his reason, was
not equally guilty, if he was not the more guilty of the two."
It is not at present in the power of Magistrates to teach
a publican convicted of going on serving already drunken
sots, not to do so any more, by accommodating him in
prison. A statute enabling a Justice so to accommo-
date such publicans would perhaps really tend, in some
considerable measure, to make people sober by Act of
Parliament.

I started with erroneous views of Ireland.
Ifavpy Thought (for an Artist).—A Series of Erroneous Views—
Dissolving.
Most Saxons are unwilling to abandon their prejudices. If I had
any, I am most ready to give them up.
What I have seen I have recorded. What I have not seen, and
what I had been led to expect I should see at every turn of the road,
so to speak, were the following items of Irish life and character,
according to popular notions:—
What I have.not seen in Ireland.
I have not seen any fighting.
I have not seen any drunkenness.
I have not been mistaken for a Middleman, and shot at from
behind a hedge.
I have not seen a wake.
I have not seen a priest going through the village with a horse-
whip in his hand.
I have not met with an uncivil Irishman.
I have not seen anything resembling " swarms of beggars."
I.have not, to my knowledge, met a Fenian.
I have not met an out-and-out decided Home-Ruler.
I did not have one single drop of rain for a whole fortnight,
which included four days at Killarney.
And I have never seen an Irishman, under any circumstances, in
a hurry.
As to electioneering extravagances reflecting disgrace on all
parties alike, I did not assist as a spectator, and only read full
reports of them in the local newspapers of various political shades.
Electioneering seems to me to be pretty much the same everywhere,
and "may differences of opinion never alter friendship" — even
when brickbats are taken for arguments.
A short tour and a merry,—such is life, or rather so mote it be. A
pleasant holiday it has oeen, and I wish myself many happy
returns of that day when it struck me, as a Happy Thought, to
take a little Tour in Ireland.
HORTICULTURE WITHOUT HUMBUG.
IT is announced that, "notwithstanding the unfortunate financial
position of the Royal Horticultural Society, the present Council,
composed as it is mainly of horticulturists, are about to make a bold
stand in the interests of horticulture, and to save the Society from
absolute extinction." That is, of course, endeavour to save it;
which there is hope they may manage through "its reconstruction
on a satisfactory basis; out only on the condition that, above and
before all other objects, the development of the theory and practice
of horticulture shall be the aim kept steadily in view." Let them
stick to that, and then the Horticultural Society will at any rate
answer its purpose, to the end perhaps of answering in the sense of
paying.
In that happy event the associated Royal Horticulturiste will
no more exhibit themselves during the middle of summer, as it were
in the melancholy position sometimes occupied at Christmas by
"Frozen-out Gardeners," but will, on the contrary, abide in the
paradise of "Jolly Gardeners " all the year round.

ABEIDOED PROSPECTUS.
THE success which has attended Brigandage in Sicily has induced
the Directors of this Company to offer to the British public extra-
ordinary advantages by the formation of this their Association. In
a wealthy country like England, robbery in all its branches is enor-
mously remunerative. Until the formation of the English Brigandage
Company the trade has been carried, on in a fragmentary and
incomplete manner. A vast loss of cash and energy has been the
necessary consequence. The Directors propose to cafl the productive
principle of co-operation to their aid, and to combine a number of
fairly paying but now independent branches of industry in one
highly lucrative whole.
To secure this very desirable result, the Directors are in treaty
with the proprietors of many eligible swindling concerns. They
hope soon to acquire possession of some two hundred first-class
hotels in London, Scotland, and the fashionable watering-places.
In some of these establishments it may be necessary to put the
locks of the bedrooms in a thorough state of unrepair; but the
tariffs in the Coffee-Rooms will in no single instance require any
alteration.
In future the attendants at the Theatres will be the servants of
the Company. The Directors are pleased to say that the business
of this branch of the Association is at present so perfect in its
working that it is hardly capable of improvement.
The Directors of the English Brigandage Company have also
acquired most of the metropolitan cabs. It will, in a large majority
of cases, be unnecessary to change the present drivers.
Arrangements are also being made to purchase the good-will of
several old-established "West-End shops. As the retiring managers
have volunteered to continue their services to the Company, the
happiest results are confidently expected.
The Directors may add, too, that many foreign Governments,
several Insurance Associations, and City Companies innumerable
are in treaty with the officers of the Company. The Managing
Director (JEREMY DIDDLER, ESQ.) is busy inquiring into these
ventures, with a view to discovering whether they are likely to
prove lucrative investments.
In conclusion, it will be seen that it has been thought unnecessary
to appoint any Solicitors to the English Brigandage Company
(Limited). The Directors beg to say that the operations in which
they hope to indulge will be conducted in strict accordance with the
laws of the land. Finally, the officials of the Company propose to
act up to the spirit of the mottoes they have proudly assumed—
"No money returned!" and " Honour among Thieves!"

of the book becoming an imme-

A captious critic might con-
sider the incidents somewhat
improbable, but we all know that

May we not in all deference
ask of the author whether, for so
long a story, the narrative is not
pitched in too sad a key?
A play is never seen to advan-
tage on a first night.
It may be that the author has

Tipperary.
A few more rehearsals would
certainly have improved the
performance.
We have no doubt that, after
the judicious use of the pruning-
knife, this piece will prove a
lasting success.
Tumultuous applause greeted
the end of the drama, although
there were to be heard here and
there some slight tokens of dis-
approbation.
How TO READ IT.
FINDING that the volumes were
not cut, we glanced at the index,
and at the first and last chapters.
The vulgarity of every page is
certain to disgust everybody.
It is too dull to be rend.
It will possibly be asked for at
the Libraries for ten days, and
will then certainly be forgotten.
The incidents are too ridiculous
to interest a sentimental school-
girl.
The work is very long and very
dreary.
We sat in a draught.
The piece is a vulgar adapta-
tion from the French, but the
Author is an acquaintance of the
Critic's.
MR. BLANK never played worse
in his life.
MR. DASH'S accent was de-
cidedly Whitechapel.
The actors did not know their
parts.
By totally omitting two Acts,
and shortening the other three, a
play would be obtained which
might run a few nights.
If the house had not been
packed, the piece would have
been hissed off the stage.

[See the Story told at the Inquest on EMMA BLACK, who died
of fright, caused, according to nor own statement, and that of
several of her little- fellow-scholars, by her being shut in a dnrk
closet at a Board School in Lambeth.]
THE little Blacks in olden days
Were pitied by the nation,
Kind hearts were busy finding'ways
To send them consolation.
To save small niggers from the dark
Of slavish fear that bound them,
And kindle in their minds a spark
From Freedom's light around thdn.
Yet yesterday a little BLACK,—
At school in this great City,—
Shivered from life to death, lor ]a;k
Of human help and pity.
Shut in the darkness lone and drear,
The tiny, trembling lisper
Froze in the icy grasp of Fear—
This is the tale they whisper!
The story makes one catch one's 1 T*A th:
A babe, for baby errors
Done so remorselessly to death,
la childhood's darkling ternrj!
Thank God, a doubt the crime hangs o'er;
Those who should know foreswore it;
Though little ones their witness bore,
And trembled while they bore it.
How EMMA BLACK came by the fear
That gave her to death's dolours,
The Jury found no witness clear
From her small fellow scholar?.
But truth is truth, from great or small:
A School-Board's bound to trace it.
When Black deaths from dark closets call,
A doubt left should disgrace it!

COMPANY MANNERS.
DEAR ME. PUNCH,
THE consequences to wives and families, as well as to
husbands themselves, of the latter becoming Directors of bogus
Companies are so terrible, that it would only be right that women
sliould be able to obtain an immediate divorce on their husbands'
n-iraes appearing on a prospectus. I have only lately rescued my
lord and master from the jaws of the City lions, and his symptoms
were so remarkable before forming his " Company," that I think it
micrht serve as a guide to other wives to detail them :—
First. Although it had been difficult (we being independent) to
get him out of the house for a few hours together, he suddenly
began to absent himself for the entire day, his account being that
he had met THOMPSON, and been with him to "the City."
Secondly. Though previously careless in his dress, he suddenly
became most particular about the polish of his boots and the brush-
ing of his hat.
Thirdly. Generally returned late for dinner, and smelt strongly
of sherry and cigars.
Fourthly. Brought other gentlemen, also smelling of sherry and
cigars, home occasionally.
Fifthly. Sat late over the wine on these last occasions, and left
early next morning for "the City." Carried mysterious printed
documents in his pocket. "Was restless at ni^ht.
Sixthly. Drew one or two large cheques, with only initials on the
counterfoil.
Seventhly. Gave a "little " dinner in "the City," costing forty
pounds odd.
Lastly. Came home rather excited one evening, telling me he had
a little surprise for me, that it was " all right!" THOMPSON had
consented to take ten thousand pounds for his patent, the " Com-
pany" was formed, and he, my husband, was on the direction!
To all thin I need scarcely add that he required £1000 at once ; but
as my consent and signature were necessary, I sternly^ withheld
them, and his name no longer figured on the prospectus. The Com-
pany, however, was formed without him. THOMPSON got a great
part of his ten thousand for his patent, for something about as
valuable as the process of making a pair of boots into a pair of shoes
by cutting off their tops, and the Company is in liquidation.
Criminal proceedings have been threatened, MR. THOMPSON has
disappeared, and my " little man" no longer visits the City, except
with myself, to draw our dividends from the Bank of England.
I am, dear Mr. Punch, yours sincerely,

THE REMOVAL OF A NUISANCE.
A SPECIAL MEETING of the European Commission of the Danube
is to take place almost immediately, to decide on the means of
removing the obstruction caused to the navigation by the ship
Turkish Empire, which came to grief on the banks of that river
some time ago. .
We understand an • ffer has already been made by the eminent
English shipbuilder?, MESSRS. BEACONSFIELD & Co., who propose
to raise, repair, re-fasten, and re-metal the chip (the whole to be
done by piecework), so as to enable her to be re-classed for a
further period of years. On the other hand, an equally well-
known iirm of Russian engineers maintain that the ship is no
longer in a fit condition to he sent to sea, her timbers being com-
pletely rotten, and insist that she should be broken up, they doing
the work (by means of blasting powder), and being allowed to retain
part of the old materials as their remuneration.
The European Commission do not bind themselves to accept the
lowest or any tender.

GOOD SPIRITS.
A GREAT deal has recently been written about the wickedness of " Drunkards," and it
is consequently satisfactory to find that steps are being taken for their reformation. Even
the papers dealing with " Spiritualism" have devoted their columns to a consideration of
the subject. For instance, in one of these periodicals on November 17th, an advertisement
appears in which a Young Lady offers to cure "Dipsomania " by Mesmerism, on the following
terms—" One Guinea per consultation. Two Guineas a month for Postal Treatment."
Without describing the "consultation" (which must be an interesting interview). Mr.
Punch satisfies himself by publishing a few of the letters of a "Dipsomaniac," who, he
believes, has availed himself of the Postal Treatment,"—pour encourager les autret:—

THE FOUNT OF INSPIRATION.
MR. PUNCH, haying asked to whom we are
indebted for the idea of Elephants at the
Lord Mayor's Show, has received the fol-
lowing answer from a Pillar of Leadenhall
Market:—
Leadenhall Market,
MR. PUNCH, SIR, Nov. 23,1876.
My attention having been drawn
to the question respecting who suggested
the idea of Elephants in the Lord Mayor's
Show, I beg leave to say MR. ALDERMAS
CARTER called upon me some six or seven
weeks since. 1 said he was the very
Gentleman I wished to see, and introduced
the subject of Elephants in the forthcom-
ing Lord Mayor's Show. The worthy Alder-
man appeared somewhat surprised, and
asked it also the howdah could be pro-
cured. I replied yes, and also the Elephants'
Trunks, and he very kindly replied he cer-
tainly would name it to SIK THOMAS WHITE,
having an invite to dine with SIR THOMAS
the next day. Otherwise I should have
written to SIR THOMAS myself upon the
subject.
Although I have had no notice taken of
my idea, I am glad it gave great satis-
faction, and my friend, MR. GEORGE SAN-
GER, fully entered into the merits of my
Lord Mayor's Show for 1876, with his
thirteen Elephants, and. I am fully under
the impression, the first Elephants ever seen
at a Lord Mayor's Show, for in 1856 we
only had about five Elephants in England.
I remain, Mr. Punch, yours truly,

OUR NEW SPORTING NOVEL.
PKEFACE.
(The following Correspondence, having reference to the production of
a new Sporting Novel in this Journal, is now placed before our
Headers, in the hope that they will kindly give it their earliest
attention, and accept it as a sufficient Preface to the projected
Work.)

HAVING had the great
pleasure of meeting you at a
friend's house, where the con-
versation after dinner turned
on IFox-hunting and kindred
matters, I was struck by a re-
mark of yours to the effect
that " you thought the Pro-
prietors of Setts Life had
never made such a step in
the right direction as When
they engaged CAPTAIN HAWLEY SMART," Author of Two Kisses,
in three volumes—" Very short allowance; by the yay>" as. 1
observed to you, Sir, at the time—" to contribute a serial Sporting
Novel to their paper."
You may remember, among the other capital things I uttered on
that occasion, how I said that Sell's Life wanted a. fillip, and it had
got an Alexander. By which I meant—but perhaps this is unne-
cessary to explain to you, Sir, who, I am bound to say, though you
smiled, did not seem to understand the epigram; for an epigram it
was, if ever there was one on this earth. However, passons,—et a
nos moutons. (French, you '11 observe, Sir.) You then went on to
declare that you would give a great deal if you could only get a
Sporting Novel in the pages of P—ch. I turned that over in my
mind. The hour was come and the man; or, to put it more sport-
ingly, the man who could tell you " what time of day it was," was
before you at that moment, or rather, to be literal and correct, at
your side. You eould not have told, from my calm manner of
cracking walnuts, what was within my shell at that moment. The
laughter rang on, and the shouts went up, and the wine went round,
but I was silent. To paraphrase the well-known song, "And the
Cracking of my own Nut was the only Sou?ul I heard."
When I got home, Sir, I dashed at it. It was in me ; out it
must come. Yes, there was a Sporting Novel in me somewhere, and so
you may look for it shortly. A good candle needs no bushel; and
before many hours are past the first chapters shall be in your intel-
ligent hands. I believe you, Sir, are ready to admit your ignorance
of sporting matters entirely. Now, though I say it who perhaps
should not, yet if I don't, who will? except perhaps my good friend,
CAPTAIN HAWLEY SHABT, whose generous nature (there is real Free-
masonry among all true sportsmen) would be only too delighted to
welcome an honest rival in the field where he has already won his
spurs—his "Latchfords," as we of the craft style 'em—but, as I
was saying of myself, there is not in England a man who knows
more about Sporting than myself; and but that there cannot be two
Richmonds in the field—I should say BeWs Life, not Field—at the
same time, I would long ago have complied with your request,
which was to the effect that I should " throw my leg over that spicy
tit Pegasus, pluck a quill out of his wings, crack my caduceus,
give him his head, and clear the Rubicon" (which was precious
little more than a muddy ditch, and wanted "clearing " as much as
my bagful of scents and cigars does, when I am de retour from
the Continong). "at a single bound." *
Where my dear friend and fellow-sporting novelist, HAWLEY,
would have "been when once / had taken up the running, it is not
for my modesty to say. He might have just caught sight of the
silver thread in Pegasus' tail, as we popped over the double Bullfinch,
flew the post and rails (including the sleepers), and disappeared
from view. "D'ye ken JOHH PIEL?" W-w-whoop! and away!
"For the sound of the horn" &c. That's the poetry for mymoney,
and this will be the sporting novel for yours. Isn't the hunting
season commencing, and am I not up to time? Let my fellow-
sporting novelist look to his laurels.' And, by the way, when I had
a cottage in the country, we found a Fox in the Laurels. And
now, Sir, Tallyho ! and I can't say fairer than that,—except that, if
you choose to repudiate, I shall send this invaluable work of mine
to Reynard's Miscellany. But you won't, I know you won't. Only
please do not attempt to edit me—I mean unless you are thoroughly
up in sporting phrases and sporting life generally—it would be,
on your part, a thankless and hopeless task. 'Trust me," as
ME. MiLLAis'picture said. I know all about it. Nunquam dormio .'
omnis oculus meus .' And let our cry be '' Fox " et prceterea Nil!
Yours to hounds,
JAWLEY SHABP
(Late of the Indi Spensibles).
P.S.—Ours was a crack corps, and the best whist-players in the
Service. By Jove, Sir, we 'ye seen life! But not a word against
our moral character! We lived amongst the Ayahs, the Nautches,
and the Bayaderes,—" Bayards panni les Bayaderes, sans peur et
sans reproche,"
P.S. No. 2.—Mind, you 're to come and stay at my old ancestral
place during the hunting season. Come for as long as you like. I can
mount you in first-rate style. Got just the thing for you ; the quietest
horse you ever saw. House full, first-rate shooting and hunting.

A HATFUL OF MONET!
A TALE OF THE CHEAT TWO THOUSAND.
BY JAWLEY SHARP,
Author of "Squeezing Langford," " Three Kicks," <te., d-c.
* Note by the Editor.—Several times during the perusal of this communi-
cation have we been on the point of laying it down, and deliberating as to
whether we should consider ourselves bound by any casual statement made,
over nuts, after dinner, at a friend's house. "And BRUTUS is an honourable
man; so are we all, all honourable men"—and indeed, were it not for this
firm conviction, on our part, of our intending Contributor's integrity and good
faith—excellent qualities, even when brought into play tinder * mistaken sense
of duty—vie should not be inclined to proceed any further with a gentleman
who suggests (to say the least of it) that ice formulated a request to the ert'ei t
that he would " throw Ids Itq over that tpiey tit, Pegasus " — good heavens!
—and that" he should crack )tii caduceus." Now we do know what a caduccus is,
and it is most improbable (of course not absolutely impossible, if in mere play-
fulness, just to moisten the nuts,—though of this we protest, warmly protest,
we have no recollection whatever) that tee, in our senses, should have ever
asked MAJOH JAWLEY SHARP to commit any such absurdity as is implied in
the operation of "cracking a caduceia." On the other hand, we must be
honest, and admit that, as we were engaged on walnuts at the moment, some-
thing about "cracking" might have escaped our lips, and subsequently our
memory. We have, ere now, cracked both jokes and walnuts at a sitting, and
remember neither the one, nor the other, in detail. But we are nothing if
not classical; and that we ever, on any occasion, mixed up a caduceus with a
hunting-whip is what we are unwilling for one minute to allow. There was
probably an interval between the two conversations, and, perhaps, our
esteemed Son of Mars and Votary of Diana—a description of the sportsman-
warrior which is at once classical and correct, and, thertjore, in our own scholarly
style—carried the spoils of our conversation with him, so to speak, to his tent,
and there, afterwards, tried to fit the pieces together, and produce something
like the original. Again, having brought in Pegasus and the caduceus, ire
should never have mentioned " the Rubicon" in the same breath. Reluct-
antly constrained to pause and say this much in our own defence, as against the
worthy Major's reminiscences, we resume our perusal of his letter in a conci-
liatory spirit, and shall be pleased, if we see our way to it, to give the gallant
sportsman a place in our columns.—ED.
t Editor to MAJOH JAWLEY SHARP, in answer to Postscript jVb. 2.—Shall
be delighted. It will be ourselves down to the ground—we mean on horse-
back. When shall it be? We do not care how soon, or for how long. If
press of business compels us to come up to Town once or twice during our
visit, it need be for only a very few hours, and back again in plenty of time
for dinner. Nous y sotnmea. Of course your Novel will be all right. It
shall appear at once, and the very best place shall be given to it. Splendid
notion of yours! We, speaking editorially, are most delighted to think that
a mere classical allusion of ours, thrown out at haphazard over nuts at a
friend's dinner-party should have led to such a happy result. What a night
we had of it, eh? Send us a list of your trains, and mind there 's a trap,
and a quiet horse, with a man to drive, to meet us at the station. Fire in the

driven home, and divorce, if requisite, brought to every

here are plenty of other working men who would avail

Eider LEO and URSA, meeting.
Leo. Which is your road?
Ursa. The right, if yonder post
Point rightly.
Leo. Humph! I Ve heard—believed almost -
The other one more tended to your goal.
Ursa. "Which you imagined was P
Leo. "Well, Istamboul.
Una. Indeed! I 've not the slightest recollection
Of haying hinted that was my direction.
Leo. Possibly not. Some travellers are chary
Of making public their itinerary.
But those who claim to have had a private peep
Ursa. Pooh! Prying prophets think they 're deuced deep.
They 'd make the Bear a bugbear. Take my word,
Their terrors and their tips are both absurd.
Leo. Your word?
Ursa (bridling). I hope you do not mean to question
My honour? I feel hurt at the suggestion.
Leo. Oh not at all? But Khiva? May I mention
That there you rather altered your—intention?
You blink I see: the question is a graveller.
But, if you are a bonaflde traveller,
In this direction, which is also mine,
We need not then collide, and block the line.
Ursa. Of course not! 'Tis a thing I 'd fain avoid.
But I have been exceedingly annoyed
By people who misread my earnest care
To—have all roadways kept in good repair.
Leo. Humph! I can sympathise with that at least.
I must not have that blocked which leads due East.
My business often lies that way. At present
My only object is to make things pleasant
As well as safe. This Conference on Repairs
I hope may clear the road.
Ursa. Like Suez Shares?
Leo. For all. I have no interests to serve
Save honest ones. From those I shall not swerve.
Ursa. It scarce can be an " honest interest"
To have yon half-way house maintained a nest
For knave and slave, tyrant and tortured thrall,
Just for your own convenience?
Leo (emphatically). Not at all!
That must be altered, let who will say nay,
But—so as not to stop my right of way!
Ursa. I ask no better.
Leo. Honour bright?
Ursa (with dignity). I swear
Upon my faith as gentleman and bear.
Leo. Then, as we both seem travelling the same way,
Why not together?
Ursa (cocking his ear doubtfully). Was not that the bray
Of an alarum?
Leo (reassuringly). Oh! that's only BEN.
He loves to blow his trumpet now and then,
Not always d propos. He must be busy.
But tho' the world whirl England is not Dizzy!
Fireworks his whole life long he has been weak on,
But don't think every flare he fires a beacon.
You walk this road with me, and all goes right:
Not till you take the other need we fight.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHAT IT MAY COME TO.
EING THE DOCTRINE OF
DEVELOPMENT FROM A
NEW POINT OF VIEW.
(A Dramatic Fragment of the
Future.)
SCENE — Dining - Room af
the period (A.D. 2877).
MR. SIMIA SATVRCS ana
MB. TROGLODYTES NIGER
indulging in post-prandiat
gossip.
Mr. Troglodytes Niger.
Decent animal that waiter
of vours, SIMIA.
Mr. Simia Satyrus. Why,
yes, TROQ. Rather a curi-
osity, too. eh? Genus Homo,
now nearly extinct; and, oi
the specimens left, there are
few indeed we can utilise,
even as flunkeys. But, as
you say, poor SMTTHEBS—
family name of his tribe—is
a decent beast.'
Mr. Troglodytes Niger, Sure, he doesn't understand us, eh? He
looks
Mr. Simia Satyrus. Bless you, no! That's a bit beyond him.
'Cute creature, though. Reasons in his rude human way, with a
sharpness hardly inferior to the lower degrees of intuitive instinct.
For instance, he served, the other day, some South Afrite Sherry
less than twenty years in bottle. Of course I could tell the year of
vintage at the. first taste. I made him fetch the bottle, pointed out
to him the Number 10 plainly inscribed thereon.and then shied the
bottle at his head, as a mild mnemotechny. Would you believe
it? When I put into his hand, a good week afterwards, a ten-pound
note, to take up to MR. S., he dropped it incontinently, and fled,
shrieking!
Mr. Troglodytes Niger. Marvellous! Must make a note of it for
my paper on " Primitive Culture in the pre-Simian Period." Such
really respectable reasoning, one would almost think, might in time,
and under favourable conditions, be almost developed into instinct,
eh?
Mr. Simia Sati/rus. Hardly. A pleasing speculation, but expe-
rience contradicts it. While men held sway on the earth Reason
was their speciality, of which they were fatuously proud. A nice
mess they made of it!
Air. Troglodytes Niger. Ha! ha! ha! The scanty records which
we possess—and which have recently been laboriously deciphered
by PROFESSOR LEMUR—of the doings of that poor human race, do
indeed teem with absurdities. I know of no more amusing reading.
Why, the other day, I was shown some fragments of a preposterous
topsy-turvy pseudo-scientist—name, I think, BARWIN, or something
like it—who seems, indeed, to have stumbled, in a blind way, upon
the track of the great doctrine of Development, but—ho! ho! I can
scarcely tell you—concluded, in his egregious conceit, that his
own petty species were descended—by which the blunderer meant
ascended—from, what do you think? Monkeys!!! Ho! ho! ho!
While all the time the superior race—then, indeed, in its infancy-
was preparing for that swift growth and sudden uprising which
capsized the human power and polity in so short a time.
Mr. Simia Satyrus. Ha! ha! ha! I fancy I have read, too, that
about the same time it was proposed by some other equally crass
Topsy-turyyist to utilise Apes as servants! Really, the whirligig
of time brings its revenges, as one of the shrewdest of that wretched
race is said to have remarked.
Mr. Troglodytes Niger. Must have been an Ape born before his
time.
Mr. Simia Satyrus. Possibly. Take another Cocoanut, TBOG.
Now, really, you should not crack them with your teeth, TBOO.
There s the portable electro-dynamic crusher at your elbow.
Mr. Troglodytes Niger (laughing). Is your guest a miserable Man,
that he should stand in terror of toothache, or of their great-little
fetish, Etiquette?
Mr. Simia Satyrus. No, no, of course not. Only the crusher
saves trouble. In those days they had something of the sort, only
of clumsier construction, and with only boiling water for a motor, to
thump their coarse and ugly material—Iron I think they called it—
into shape for the purposes of their preposterous enterprises in War
and Commerce.
Mr. Troglodytes Niger. Ah, more of the triumphs of Reason!
These men seem to have passed their time mainly in systematic
sharping, which they called trade, varied with occasional d«lirious
interludes of mutual slaughter, which they called patriotism. Poor
devils! Well, as all our necessary processes of agriculture, manu-
facture, and transport are accomplished by automatic and self-
renewing machinery, and as fighting is as obsolete as fig-leaves, of
course we are happily emancipated from those two long-reigning
lunacies.
Mr. Simia Satyrus. It looks as if every Man must have spent half
the miserable span of his own existence in preparations to cut short
some one else's.
Mr, Troglodytes Niger. Quite so. You see they were " reason-
able creatures," and Reason is a hocus-pocus process that must lead
to absurdity. The Age of Reason was the Utopia which the Topsy-
turvyites looked forward to as the consummation of human felicity.
Ha! ha! When they had already "reasoned" themselves into
such fools' purgatories as money-grubbing, etiquette, war, and,
above all, fashion!
Mr. Simia Satyrus. Ah, that was their Supreme Fetish. Instinct
—even such rudimentary instinct as they could have possessed, the
instinct of taste and of modesty—must have warned them against
the tyranny of Fashion; did, indeed, as we find from rare relics of
the pictorial satirists of the period. But, on the whole, Reason ruled
them to the end. And a brave end it was.
Mr. Troglodytes Niger. Well, it was in the order of Nature, and
in simple conformity with the great doctrine of the Survival of the
Fittest, that their inferior and unhappy race should die out and
make way for Us.
Mr. Simia Satyrus. Of course. In our great Typical Museum,
TROG, you will see placed in expressive proximity under section
Homo, an ancient purse, a rusty sword, and the tattered remains of
what was once a fashionable bonnet.
Mr. Troglodytes Niger. A suggestive triad! Poor SMTTHEBS!
What must be his thoughts in gazing upon those dreary relies of
his race's domination, now happily extinct, and of the quondam
despotic sway of Reason? Heaven be thanked, SIMIA, that we were
born Monkeys and not Men!
Mr. Simia Satyrus. Amen!
DOCKYAED ADMINISTRATION.
(A Farce tliat may be easily turned into a Tragedy.)
SCENE—An office gorgeously fitted with antique furniture. Portraits
of NvLsox.and other naval heroes hanging on the walls. Bundles
of dust-covered papers and Slue-Hooks resting on a table behind
a screen. Admiral-Superintendent trying on a new uniform
coat, Tailor and JOHN (a servant) in attendance.
Admiral (taking of his coat). It's a little tight in the sleeves.
Mind, I shall want it back to-morrow night. I have to attend a
launch (at ;which some Ladies will be present) on Wednesday.

my Private Secretary?
John. MB. TENTEBFOUK, Sir? Yes, Sir, MB. TENTEKFOUB, Sir,
left his compliments, Sir, and said as it was such a fine day he's
gone out fishing.
Admiral. Very good. Then I will keep to-day's letters until
to-morrow. They can wait. You 're a smart fellow, JOHN. I hope
you like your present place, JOHN?
John. Very much indeed, thank you, Sir. When I was a working
carpenter, Sir, I was always bisy, now after I have brushed your
clothes, Sir, I have next to nothing to do. [A knock at the door.
Admiral. Who 's that, JOHN?
John. The Master-Attendant, Sir.
Admiral. .What, COMMODORE; MUTTONHEAD? What a nuisance!
He is as deaf as a post! You can ask him to come in, JOHN; but
remain outside.
John. Yes. Sir.
[Exit, and enter COMMODORE MCTTONHEAD, a very old man,
wearing spectacles, and carrying an ear-trumpet.
Muttonhead. Oh, dear! oh, dear! it's half killed me getting up
those stairs (sinking into a chair). I was a stronger man sixty
years ago.
Admiral. You 're looking very well. Nothing wrong, I hope?
If there is, pray don't tell me anything about it. Mind, I am not
in the least responsible for anything or anybody. So please don't
bother. Have a cigar?
Muttonhead. What?
Admiral (through ear-trumpet). Have a cigar?
Muttonhead. Thank you, I only take snuff. What I want to see
you about is this. I have just rigged
Admiral (hurriedly interrupting). Yes, yes. But pray don't tell
me any grievance. I am not responsible.

Muttonhead. Of course not. Good-bye!
Admiral (through the ear-trumpet). You are not going?
Muttonhead. I must. You won't see me for the next three weeks.
I have got to decide upon an alteration in the size of one of our flags.

Admiral. Don't you know him, JACK ? , Why, MUTTONHEAD, to be
sure.
Chief Storekeeper. Think of that! Both of us been here all this
time, and never met before! What fun, eh? I have got such a
good story to tell you!
Admiral (settling himself comfortably in an arm-chair). Do,
JACK—do tell it me. It's so awfully slow here all day with nothing
to do!
Chief Storekeeper. Well, you must know, TOMMY, that HAEBY
HAWSEB, who's just been sent to look after the Anchor Department,

about a quarter of a million of public money—-finishing the story.)
And so I replied, of course, that the responsibility didn't rest with
me. Ha! ha! ha! _ 11 A it it Y and I had such a laugh over it when
we met at the Club in the evening!

wonder what they are about? (Opens protests, and glances at their
contents.) Dear me, if I were still a working carpenter, and had
sufficient authority, I would settle all these matters in five minutes.
But here I am only a servant; and it is better to serve than to
govern in Her Majesty's Dockyards; at least, so my Master tells
me; and he ought to know.

BRADSUA w is not exactly a festive publication, and,
certainly, the lovers of "racy" novels would not study
its pages in search of sensation; but in a four hours'
journey there comes a moment when all the weeklies,
dailies, and magazines have beea devoured, when SPIERS
AND POND'S basket has been emptied, when sleep refuses
to come, and travelling is beginning to bore, and in such
a moment you dive despairingly into the well-known
Railway Guide, more in quest of arithmetical problems
than in hopes of amusement.
In such a fit of despondency, Mr. Punch's eyes
alighted, with a beam of surprise, on the following ad-
vertisement among the only really literary pages of the
publication—those relating to hotels, many of which are
illustrated: —

to the astonishment of a Clerical Error in a white tie
and the opposite corner. "Ha! ha I That is the place

But how can the Manager ensure " Handsome Lady"
visitors only to his Coffee-Room? It is to be hoped, at
least, there is a Knight Porter in attendance!
THE EUROPEAN CONCERT.
(See Government Papers, passim.)
THE grunt of a Bear who at booty hath looked
Which he cannot quite seixe on;
The cry of a Turkey who dreads being cooked
A In Husse, and with reason;
The shrieks of two two-headed Eagles, whose voices
Are wholly discordant;
The crow of a Cock, who supremely rejoices
In melody mordant;
The voice of a Lion, who hardly knows whether
To roar or to cackle:
Nice subject for Concert it looks altogether,
One WAGNER should tackle.
The theme " yearns for music," like mythus Germanic.
Cacophony's certain;
And as for the audience, they, in a panic,
Long most for—the curtain.
THB THING TO THKOW LIGHT ON SPIRITUALISTIC
SEANCES.—A Spirit-Lamp.
"MEDIUMS" IN PRUSSIA.
(From Our Colney Hatch Correspondent.)
THE periodical organs of Spiritualism occasionally publish
accounts of wonderful spiritual " manifestations," alleged to occur
through the " mediumship " of young children. A case evidently
of this description is noticed by the Times' Prussian Correspondent,
as follows:—
"The three children at Marpingen, in Prussian Rhineland, who last
Bummer tinted they had repeatedly seen the Holy Virgin in a wood close to
their Tillage, and whose glowing asseverations, backed by the Clergy,
attracted thousands of pilgrims to the sacred spot, have just been tried by
JUDGE COMES, at St. Wendel. Upon the children confessing that they had
been telling lies, they were sentenced to be placed in an educational estab-
lishment for culprits under twelve years of age."
These children were doubtless gifted with mediumistic powers.
The multitude of Mediums now daily cropping up everywhere gives
a new force to the old saying that "there is a medium in all things."
There are Protestant Mediums, and, as appears from the foregoing
statement, Catholic Mediums; in fact, every faith has its Medium,
and a suitable toast at a Spiritualists' dinner, or "tea," would be
"Mediums of all Denominations."
The three children above referred to were true Mediums notwith-
standing their confession that they had told lies. Otherwise of
course their glowing asseverations would never have been backed by
an enlightened Clergy. They must have seen an apparition,
although perhaps they rather magnified what they saw. This is
characteristic of Mediums in general. As the Spiritualist says, in
an able apology for DK. MONCK, now, like DR. SLADE, in. trouble, a
Medium is " ready to confess anything, or to do anything to get out
of trouble." True Mediums are apt, for all the truth that is in them,
occasionally to eke out real manifestations by imposture. Their
real manifestations are not on that account the less real, or the less
credible. Mediums are generally to be believed and trusted, unless
when they confess themselves to have told lies, and then their con-
fessions should be disbelieved. Moreover, Mediums of all persua-
sions, or of no persuasion at all, are all equally trustworthy, or, as
Spiritualist writers prefer to say, reliable.
The confession stated to have been made by three juvenile
Mediums, whose mediumship is now being deteriorated or destroyed
in a Prussian reformatory, was clearly extorted from them by in-
timidation. In Prussia Mediums are persecuted, especially those
whose creed renders them especially obnoxious to BISMARCK. But
Mediums of that class, at least, are exempt from persecution in
France, if their asseverations are duly backed by the Clergy. Ac-
cordingly, the " Apparition of La Salette," just such another as the
Apparition of Marpingen, attended and attested by the creation of
a permanently miraculous fountain, is believed by everybody but
Protestants and sceptics. The water of this fountain cures all
diseases as certainly as GULLOWAY'S Pills do. It has become an
article of commerce like Apollinaris, and, besides being a panacea,
can be advantageously substituted for Seltzer or Soda, and serve to
compose a salubrious and sanctifying beverage in the form of
"Salette and Brandy."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAR1VAE1.
PROJECTED BOMBARDMENT OF THE WEST-END.
R. PUNCH feels it
his duty to call the
attention of all re-
sidents and owners
of property at the
West-End of Lon-
don to the follow-
ing authentic par-
ticulars :—
It will be seen by
the date given that
there is no imme-
diate cause for
nlarm, but time
flies rapidly, and
among bis multi-
farious duties Mr.
Punch may not
find another oppor-
tunity of pointing
out the peculiar
peril which appears
to be looming; in
the distance.
It is surmised
that the Authorities at Woolwich have been somewhat'cbagrined at finding
that at the recent trial of the 81-ton Gun seven panes of glass at Shoeburyness
remained uninjured, that no passing vessel was destroyed, and that out of

about one hundred men engaged in handling the Gun
fourteen still retain their hearing.
It has consequently been determined immediately to
commence the construction of a 200-ton Gun.
The first announcement with regard to this interesting
implement is to the effect "that its size will of course
prevent its being placed on pur largest ships of war."
There is, however, "balm in Gilead;" for, after stating
the dimensions of the proposed Gun—namely, "fifty feet
long, length of bore 44 feet, and diameter 21 inches,
charge ef powder 950 Ibs., weight of shot 0000 Ibs., and
length of shot five feet, —it is confidently announced
that the Gun is expected to'be capable 01 throwing a
24-ton shot from the Government butts at Woolwich
to the West-End of London.
No doubt more precise information will be given as to
what part of the West-End (he Gun will be trained on; but
inasmuch as it is not expected that "the new 200-ton
Gup can be ready till the beginning of 1879," West-End
life and property can easily be insured in the meantime.
It may be that the intention is simply to knock over
the Duke of York's Column, and imbed the shot at the
bottom of the Ornamental Water of St. James's Park;
but it is to be hoped that a full programme of the expe-
riments will be published—before the bombardment
commences.
LITERARY. — We understand the next edition of
Boudoir Ballads is to be illustrated with Sterry-oscopic

HOUSEHOLD ART.
MB. PUNCH has received a number of letters on the subject of the
Rector of Lincoln's very suggestive address at the Oxford (City) I
Schools of Science and Art. (See Time*, November 18th.) A
selection from these he has great pleasure in laying before his
readers.
LETTER I.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
THE Rector of Lincoln saya:—
"The man who, without copying, can arrange a cluster of rose-leaves
nobly, can design anything. A Frenchwoman can do this; an Englishwoman
cannot, la it because roaes do not grow in England?"
Now, I don't exactly know what he means by arranging rose-
leaves " nobly." These Art-critics do use such queer terms! They
will persist in styling the drawing of drapery " magisterial" (which
somehow suggests the police-court), and the tinting of an elbow
"precious" (which reminds us of -bullion or baby-talk). But if he
mean that an Englishwoman can't arrange flowers and leaves and
things, whether in a bouquet or on a bonnet, just as nicely as a
Frenchwoman, I believe it s all nonsense. Praise up the past and
foreign parts as much as you please, but not a good word for the
present or our own people, on any account! That seems to be the
motto of the modem critics. Where i» the old Turkey carpet
nowP" asks MR. PATTISON, plaintively. Why, gone where I hope
those good-for-nothing Turks may soon follow it. Dowdy old
things, with dingy colours and patterns like a kaleidoscope gone
mad! He talks about "Nature, with its thousand forms and
colours of unrivalled beauty," and then goes and prefers a many-
tinted muddle of meaningless zigzags to the lovely purple fern
leaves and golden snowdrops that adorn the floor of my drawing-
room. Coal-scuttles again f He is quite dismal on the development
of the Coal-Scuttle. JOHN has just bought me a new one, the love-
liest design—a coal-vase it is called, if yon please—beautifully
japanned and gilt, so shiny you can see your face in it, with the
Falls of Niagara painted on the top—such bhie, bounding water!—
and a bunch of dahlias, just like life, on each side. If that is not
Art in the household, I should like to know what is. What would
MR. PATTISO?? have? I 'm sure I like a nice house and pretty things
as much as any woman; but if all our bright decorations are to be
denounced as "Vulgarities," what it one to do? I took such pride
in that carpet and that coal-vase, and now!
Well, I ve seen some of their High-Art-Honpeholds all out-
landishness, dim tints, and stiff discomfort; and if that's the sort
of thing they want to substitute for the cosiness and colour of an
English home, I beg to assure them it won't do for
AN ENGLISHWOMAN.
LETTER II.
DEAR PUNCH,
PATTISON is beautifully down upon "Mindless Mechanism."
Fact is, High Art will never flourish till low Machinery is abolished.
We must do away with the Steam-engine; it is the Incubus of the
Age. "Fuel," says PATTISON, "isunfortunately dirty in its nature."
So is the Locomotive. And ugly! Dirt and ugliness are inimical
to High Art. They must be banished. Don't quite know what
Nature was about when she made coal dirty—unless she wanted to
warn us against using it. Fancy Nature is a bit of a Philistine
after all, and wants elevating by being made to enter "into the
sphere of Art." Iron and coal are nuisances. Let us keep to gold
and sunshine.
Yours,
ANTI-PHILISTINE.
LETTER III.
SIB,
MORE fudge about High Art!—High-falutin' Art, /call it.
"By the habit of mechanical multiplication, invention is killed,
and the soul degraded." Indeed! I should like to make the
Gentleman live for a year, deprived of the advantages of "mecha-
nical multiplication," and I should.not like to pay his bill for steel
pens and shirt-collars at the end of the term. As to invention,
why there 's more of it in one week's number of The Engineer than
in twenty Exhibitions of the Royal Academy. Pooh! MTTRANO
acqna marina may be all very well for Chemist's show-bottles; but
give me the marine engine!
Yours,
A PRACTICAL MAN.
LETTER IV.
EXCELLENT PUNCH,
'' TniNos worse than they were thirty years ago!" Of course
they are! What is there to love in an age of lacquer? Art has
gone to the wall. Look at .our Picture-posters, and admit it!
ISrummagen Art (?) is worse than Brummagem utility. An "in-
dustrial product" trying to look like "a spiritual object," a coal-
box posing as a work of Art, are more disgusting than an old
coquette figuring as a youthful belle. High Art is hopeless. Let
us fall back on naive and antique hideousness, which is, indeed,
almost a form of beauty. To the soul sickened with the " illustrated
china" of our shop-windows there is solace in a willow-pattern
plate.
Yours, despondently,
Rococo.
LETTER V.
IMPARTIAL SIB,
IN PATTISON'S address there is much that is true-lesg that
is new, and not a little that is askew. What a pity High Art
Mentors will be so queer and querulous! Cnn't they point us to
pleasant possibilities without visiting us with the sin of vulgar
necessity? Coal is "unfortunately" dirty, yes! and many of the
forward steps of civilisation are "unfortunately" through grubby
and disagreeable ways. Let the Illuminati of Art give us more
light and less lightning, and let them shun the appearance of
ptevish dilettantism. . There are functions in this world for the

but for the Scold—domestic, political, theological, or aesthetic—no!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NEW FOOTBALL RULES.
1. No match to be played without
a Surgeon being in attendance on the
ground.
2. Should there be a hospital within
a convenient distance, notice to_ be
given •beforehand, that the services
of the Staff may be called into requi-
sition.
3. An ample supply of bandages,
lint, splint s, and other appliances to
be kept always in readiness.
4. An ambulance to be in waiting,
to convey any one who may receive
an injury to his home or to the
hospital.
5. If an ambulance cannot be pro-
cured, then a sufficient number of
Cabs to be within immediate call.
6. Proper attendants and nurses to
be engaged to wait on the sufferers.
7. Brandy and other stimulants to
be kept on the grounds.
8. Crutches and sticks to be sup-
plied for the use of those whose in-
juries may be only (light, but who
yet may require some artificial sup-
port to enable them to return to their
homes.
9. No Game.to be played except on ground within easy reach of a
Telegraph Office.
These regulations may possibly be considered severe and gloomy;
but inasmuch as FootbaD, as now too often played, appears to
inflict grievous injury, and even loss of life on those who engage
in its scrimmages, (from which it would seem to the uninitiated
hardly possible to emerge without some serious mischief) it becomes
necessary to recommend to all, both men and boys, who venture
on the game, to take every imaginable precaution.
Touchstone, in As You Like It, says, "It is the first time that
ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport for Ladies."' Had Touch-
stone been a Football player, he could not have said it was " the
first time that ever he heard breaking of legs and necks was sport
for Gentlemen."
We will not press the_ acceptance of our proposed rules, if some
code of laws can be rigidly and universally adopted, which shall
greatly lessen, if not entirely prevent, the risks that now seem to
cloud the good name of the game, and to lead to the unwelcome
introduction on the scene of the Doctor and the Coroner.

THE FIGHT OVER THE SCHOOL-BOARD.
/

POOR Education! Like a lamb beset by wolves and vultures!
How should she trim the balance fair 'twixt clashing creeds and
cultures?
All friends to her, but angry foes a uutrance to each other;
She, standing where the Champions close, can scarce tell one from
t'other.
To teach small BILL his A.B.C., or little SUE her sewing,
One well may ask is that a task to set the war-horns blowing?
But then of course the job will look much harder, and far ampler,
If BILL must have a Baptist Book, and SUE a High Church
Sampler.
The Three R.'s, muddled by a fourth,—Religion,—like the compass,
With endless " points " from south to north,—for chief result read
rumpus.
To give the young what reason asks, and simple prudence urges,
Were sure the easiest of tasks, but for the Boanerges.
The School-Board, spread with spare repast, must have "Church
Pie " for centre,
And every guest must vote that best, nought less will e'er content her.
While keen Dissent, who loathes the dish, would sooner sweep the
table
Than feed one hungry mouth on fare with that particular label.
Oh clumsy caterers! Ignorance comes, what time you scowl and
mutter,
And lures your guests to other food,—the garbage of the gutter.
Fie, Gentlemen! The common foe demands your banded forces;
To cut the ground from under him will tax your joint resources.
But still the Churchman slangs Dissent, and both bethump the
Papist,
And Nothingarians venom vent all round. No dull Red-Tapist
Could so adroitly block the way, that lay so fair before us.
As each hot Ass who lifts his bray to swell the angry chorus.
Bring not into the Schoolroom, Sirs, your doxies or your schisms,
The spelling - book and slate are not the ground for warring
isms;
The Alphabet need not be mixed with shibboleths Sectarian,
Monopoly but masquerades in guise humanitarian.
Fight fair, and in another field. Side-issues fog the unwary.
What you all mean is "our side up," although your voices
vary.
Proud "Mother Church" should be too proud to flash false lights
like rockets,
And conscience seek to circumvent by sly appeal to—pockets!
THE NAVY OF THE FUTURE.
(By Submarine Telegraph.)
GIBRALTAR, 3rd Dec., 1896.
THE Enemy's fleet was signalled early yesterday morning. It
was composed of eighty Ironclads, all carrying thirty-three feet of
armour plating, but with no armament heavier than the old-fashioned
300-ton Gun. It was soon ascertained that the Fleet had received false
intelligence about.the movements of the Wasp (our Mediterranean
Gunboat, built to carry a 2,000-ton Gun, the latest achievement of
the combined Woolwich and Elswiok Factories), and believed that
it might be possible to take Gibraltar by a coup de main during' the
absence of her little protector. By two o'clock the Enemy's Fleet
was well within range of the Wasp's gun, but her Commander pre-
ferred to allow the Ironclads to approach within a radius of fourteen
miles. At this short range the Wasp opened fire, to the consterna-
tion of the Admiral in command of the Enemy's Fleet. It wan,
however, too late to escape. Fifty outof the eighty Ironclads were soon
disposed of—smashed and sunk. The remainder hauled down their
flags. Divers are at work on the scene of action, clearing away the
submarine debris. The Wasp has lately received an important
increase to her fighting force or two Marines and Artillerymen. Her
complement is now fourteen hands, all told.

Hints with a aneer that I falter or pule,
Plausible caveats strike me as sinister,
Urged in serene disregard of that rule.

Arguments founded on feelings humane!
Superfine penmen their periods polishing
Point every gibe with that word of disdain.

It may be found that the censures which culminate
In horror of rant are but rant in their turn.

to deal with that scourge P Echo answers—if you ask loud enough
—Scourge! How has that scourge, robbery with violence, been
dealt with by the British Legislature? By means of that other
scourge, the Cat-o'-nine-tails. What is there to prevent a military
force from being despatched to hunt the highwaymen and footpads
of Naples and Sicily down, with proper dogs if necessary. When
caught, might they not summarily oe brought to trial, and, under a
statute enacted to that end, be sentenced, on conviction, to penal
servitude, and a good flogging, or several good floggings, apiece?
What an edifying sight to the Manutengoli of Sicily and the Mafia
of Naples it would be to see SIGNOR LEONE, now playing fra
Diavolo in real life thereabouts with impunity, stripped of his green
velvet jacket, lace, and ribbons, seized up in the whipping-stocks,
and lashed until he howled for mercy, and some time after!
Would not that teach him, if ever let loose again, to think twice
before again carrying off a British Banker—or anyone else—and
demanding under threat to murder or mutilate him, four thousand
pounds ransom?
The state of society in Southern Italy appears to be such that
thieves there pass for gentlemen among the nigher classes. They
need to be taught that thieves and robbers are criminals and black-
guards, and what better way of doing this could there be than
stripping such rascals as LEOTTR at once of their operatic frippery,
and their glory, and giving the Fra Diavolo of odious reality a

the Great Race of

* From the Editor to MAJOR JAWLEY SHARP.—You 've changed the name!
It was to have been A Hatful of Money. Why?
MAJOR JAWLBY SHARP to the Editor,—Friend of my youth, haven't you
ever heard of changing your name for property? "Well, Sir, I think this
Sporting Novel will be a better property under toe new title. It is enough
for me to think so; but I will give a satisfactorily artistic reason. Observe,
it has a second title. This is to attract those who never read anything but
•what is sensational; and if The Dumb Jockey of Jeddington doesn't fetch
that section of the public, I 'm dumb'd—and I cannot put it less strongly or
more genteelly than that. If, Sir, you only knew what trouble I "ve had to
find out a place in England beginning with "J," so as to fit in, alliteratively,
with " Jockey," you would be the last person to attempt finding a flaw in my

ays my name at school, and
I am proud to say that, as long as I can manage it, it shall be my sobriquet
through life. You must come down and spend a couple of months here with
me. I 've a lovely quiet horse for you—just the thing. Say when.—J. S.
From the Editor to MA JOR JAWLEY SHARP.—Highly satisfactory. Get on.
Your kind invitation I would avail myself of with pleasure, only your letter
does not bear your address; and the elderly lady who opened the door in that
siding out of Chapel Street West where your name is engraved on the brass
plate under the second bell handle, could give me no information on the
subject. Drop me a line here. Always ready to shake off the business cob-
webs, and rush into the champagney air of the country. I do not care much
about hunting; but, if the nag is very quiet, no one would enjoy a morning
on horseback more than would yours truly, THB EDITOR.
MAJOR JAWLEY SHARP to the Editor.—Ml right. Old woman in Chapel
Street is a very old servant in our family. She's been with the JATVLEY
SHARPS for years, and her father and mother before her. Dear old lady! I
still retain her on my establishment for past services; and, after all, you know
to belong to an old family engenders ties between master and servant which
are unintelligible to the parvenu. Bless dear old MARGERY! She's very
deaf, and uncommonly sagacious. I don't think you'd get anything out of
her, though she might put of you. I was annoyed she didn't show you into
the dining-room, and give you luncheon when you called; but the fact is, the
little bachelor crib is in euch disorder when I 'm at my hunting quarters that
the good old soul was unprepared for visitors. An revoir! Mind you come
down here. Everything ready for you—gun, horse, dogs, and French cook
and valet all to yourself! S»y when, that's all—merely say when. Yours

uncle was compelled by the stern monitor of the human race to
make room for his nephew.
SIR TOMMY DODD came into the estates—worth about sixty-five
thousand a year (Land-tax redeemed)—hampered only by one con-
dition, viz., That, if he did not lose three Derbys in succession, not
merely by a neck, or a length, but by his horse coming in absolutely
last of all, the whole property would pass at once to a near relative,
the HONOURABLE PULLMAN CARH, who would be saddled with
precisely the same condition. If, after trying several other members
of the family, the Derby was still being won by the Jeddington Lot,
the property was to return to SIR TOMMY TODD, the same condition
as before existing, and from him to the HONOURABLE: PULLMAN
CARR, and so on again. Only there was this proviso, that, if SIR
TOMMY should marry and there should appear a son and heir, then
the HONOURABLE PULLMAN CARR would come into the property—
"but," so the wording of the will went, "Not before the Soy."
Hard stipulations to come from the feathered goosequill in the
nervous hand of the old, good, kind-hearted, generous port-wine-
drinking, sport-loving, venerable Baronet, who thus passed away,
and, in making room for his nephew, had, indeed, struck him with
a feather.
CHAPTER II.— Which is the Favourite f
ROUND the cheery fire in the fine old ancestral Music Hall be-
longing to the DODDS, which had lately been fitted up with a sliding
roof for the amusement of the guests in winter, sat a pleasant and
aristocratic company.
"TOMMY," said the HONOURABLE PULLMAN CASH, slowly puffing
his regalia. "I'll lay you twenty thousand pounds to a sovereign
that the Derby Loser is not in your stables this year."
1' Done!" replied 8m TOMMY.
"TOMMY DODD! TOMMY DODD!" cried several voices from various
corners of the hall, "on with you again!"
"Done with you all—at the price," said SIB TOMMY, booking
the bets. "And. now," he added, "suppose we go and look at the
lot."
They all rose as one man. The sporting instinct was strong on
them.
"I '11 go with you," exclaimed a light, ringing, musical voice.
"LADY Di!" cried SLR TOMMY, "why we shall be only too
charmed."
"Of course—charmed," repeated the HONOURABLE PULLMAN, in
his low sneering voice.
LADY Di regarded him with superlative disdain. She was a mar-
vellously handsome woman was LADY DIANA BRTTELEIOH, pos-
sessed originally of locks that the most raven-ous raven might nave
envied.*
To be a Blonde, however, she thought would suit her better. So
Blonde she became, and perhaps to Black she would return. She
was highly • popular with men, and, as a natural consequence,
equally adored by her own sex.
"Blonde is the Jeddington colour now, TOMMY," she whispered,
in her sweetest low tone. Hers was a rich contralto voice; and
her highest speaking-note was to put it musically, "C under line."
"Yes," she used to say to her sparkling Mamma, "I am all down
among the coals; and my voice is more like Newcastle-under-
Line than double C." She was still unmarried. Her Aunt, who
had married the Russian Prince, STEPITOFF, accompanied her every-
where, except on the piano.
Hanging on SIR THOMAS'S other arm was the beautiful Brunette,
MRS. ASQOOD AZAMYLE, the youngest widow in the world, and the
most fascinating woman in the country. SLR THOMAS looked from
one to the other, and pressed the fair arm of each alternately.
"Where's poor BUTTON, your Stud-Groom P" asked LADY Di, as
she passed, leaning on SIR THOMAS'S arm, through the door towards
the Training Stables, at the back of the house.
"You have only to ask, and he will appear," replied SIB THOMAS,
producing a clear, bell-like whistle, by the most natural means
possible.
"How simple!" exclaimed MRS. ASOOOD AZAMYLE, ecstatically;
"you have everything at your fingers' ends."
* There are several things I want to ask. I do not pretend to be a sporting
man. But why should a " raven envy anyone's locks ? I own to not being
a skilled naturalist, but have ravens locks? You who live so much in the
country (where.« by the way—don't forget to send address next time) ought
to know all these things, and you are, I've no doubt, perfectly correct.
Secondly, how about the Derby being run in the winter? Such is your
meaning, as I gather from your opening chapter, unless you only allude to
that exceptional Derby, about four years or BO ago, which was run in a snow-
storm. Mind I don't pretend to any knowledge of sport myself, and trust
implicitly to you. Only remember the eyes of the Sporting Public are on you.
Yours truly, THB EDITOR.
from MAJOR JAWLBY SHARP to the Editor.—Dear EDDY. I never fre-
quent a " Sporting Public." You won't pick up the real information there.
Trust me. I'm in it. You 're not. Come down here, and spend Sunday.

left he warmly grasped the little eight-and-a-quarter kid that con-
cealed from the prying gaze the delicately turned fingers of the
lovely LADY Di.
The HONOURABLE Pi U.M \ N CARR gave a low sneering laugh, as,
linking his arm in that of the noble Italian sportsman, COUNT
FARRAGO DI NONSENZA, he whispered maliciously, ""Which is the

(To be continued.)

MR. PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
SECTION VII.
ONCERBING PROMOTION.
WHEN Mr. Punch re-
sumed his seat in the ante-
room he found his poor little
friend FIELD-MARSHAL SIR
FRANKY GEEGEE, K.C.B.,
in great distress. The
melancholy and diminutive
veteran was spelling over
an Army List with the aid
of a powerful magnifying
glass. Upon inquiring the
cause of ha protfge's distress
Mr. Punch was informed
that the broken-hearted
Field-Marshal was crying
over the fact that he was
the Colonel of only one
Regiment instead of four.
1?My dear little friend,"
said Mr. Punch, "you must
remember that the Colonelcy
of a Regiment is only given
to some venerable and dis-
•-—i tinguished warrior as a sort
of pension. Say that a man
has fought and bled for his country in>'half-a-dozen campaigns, has
married, and reared a large family, and at seventy or eighty years
of age is past work, and wants an addition to his scanty pay. Then
it is that the Government presents him with a Colonelcy.
"Oh, SIR FRASXT_sees it all now," cried the little Field-Marshal,
clapping his hands with pleasure. "SIR FRANKY understands now
why the DUXE OF CAMBRIDGE is Colonel of the Rifle Brigade, the
Royal Artillery, a Regiment of Guards, and the 17th Lancers."
Mr. Punch coughed (to clear his throat), and continued his
lectures.
Part I. By Merit.—An officer having chosen his Regiment, his
next care will be to rise as rapidly as possible in the ranks of the
Army List. His ambition will lead him from Sub-Lieutenant to
Lieutenant, from Lieutenant to Captain, and from thence to the
glories of gilt spurs and brass scabbards. In these days of " selec-
tion," when money goes for little or nothing, he will have to depend
much upon himself, and scarcely at all upon his banker's account.
As the Colonel gives the tone to the Regiment, it will be as well for
him to carefully study the peculiarities of his commanding officer,
with a view to forming his own conduct upon the example set to
him. As the Army is composed of all sorts and manners of men, he
may have to assume any number of disguises as he passes from bat-
talion to battalion. He may rest assured, however, that one of the
following "styles" (with mild modifications calculated to suit
the variety of each peculiar case) may be relied upon as a trust-
worthy pattern.
The Sedate Style.—Punctuality on Parade. Slight Sermons after
the reading of the Order-Book. No violent language. Delight in
serious Penny-Readings. Patronage of Sunday-Books, Missions,
and Total-Abstinence. If the Colonel is very extreme (and has an
extreme Wife), a little Sunday Preaching at the corners of thorough-
fares may be indulged in occasionally. Spectacles (if possible,
tinted) should be adopted with this style.
The Soldier-like Style.—Great smartness. Orders, answers, and
general information snapped out in words of one syllable. In
moments of excitement strong language may be permittted. Great
severity to be used to culprits appearing on Parade with a button
badly polished. Much "Military Shop ' (off Parade) should be
talked with this style.
The Peacock Style.—Gorgeous garments on all occasions. Much
zeal for the "credit of the Regiment." Duties on Parade shirked as
much as possible. Anxiety to he shown in getting up Regimental
Balls, Regimental Drags, Regiment Harriers, and Regimental Ex-
penses generally. A Breast-Pin with the cypher of the Regiment
should be habitually worn with this style.
The Humorous Style.—Great attention to he paid to "good things"
at mess. Laughter should always he at hand to welcome the
Colonel's puns. The latest comic songs should be rehearsed daily.
The banjo and the bones should he used with his style.
The Brotherly Style.—A nick-name to he adopted without hesi-
tation. No objection to be shown to practical jokes. Individual
property to be merged in the wealth of the Regiment. Promissory
notes to be signed freely. The words " dear old chappy " constantly
uttered with this style.
By adopting one of the above "rules of life" an officer should
have little difficulty in securing promotion. It is necsssary, how-
ever, that he should be careful to class his Colonel in the proper
style, or the " confidential report" upon his conduct may be the
reverse of satisfactory.
Part II. By Interest.—-If an officer have sufficient interest to
carry him up the tree of promotion, he need not trouble himself
about his surroundings. If it is known that he is "looked
after" at head-quarters, his Colonel will be chary of writing any-
thing to his disparagement. However, if he finds his regimental
duties a bore, he should take some steps to be presented with a staff
appointment. As an aide-de-camp he should enjoy the maximum
of comfort for the minimum of responsibility.
CONVERSATION ON SECTION VII.
Ensign Eugene. My dear Mr. Punch, yon have just spoken of a
"Confidential Report." Can you kindly tell me what it is?
Mr. Punch. Certainly my good ENSIGN EUGENE of the Volun-
teers. A " Confidential Report" is the document sent in annually
by a Commanding Officer to the General of his district. Sooner or
later it reaches the War Office. In this report a sketch is given (con-
fidentially) of the conduct of every officer of the Regiment, from the
senior Major down to the junior subaltern. Now, imagine all.of you
that you have to send in a Confidential Report. Say what conduct
would you consider meriting the censure of "highly unsatisfac-
tory."
Colonel Charles. If I found one of my Officers disrespectful to
me. If he addressed me without my military title out of the
training, and was inclined to criticise my knowledge of the Drill-
book when the Regiment was embodied. All this, Sir, I should
consider " highly unsatisfactory."
Mr. Punch. My dear COLONEL CHARLES, of the Royal East Mud-
borough Militia, I have no doubt you would. And you, ENSIGN
EUGENE, of the Volunteers, what conduct would you consider
"highly unsatisfactory."
Ensign Eugene. Why, of course, if he didn't pay his subscription.
Mr. Punch. And you, LIEUTENANT AKD CAPTAIN GEORGE, of the
Grenadier Guards (Green), can you tell me?
Lieutenant and Captain George. I should say his conduct was
"highly unsatisfactory" if he belonged to a bad set, and was fool
enough to offend his Colonel.
Mr. Punch. My dear pupils, you are all right, a fact that
proves that a "confidential report" must always be an exceed-
ingly valuable document.
TO THE WAITS.
(A pri-dated fraytr.)
WHY banish slumber with your Yule-tide lays.
Scare sweet forgetfulness from toil-worn wights,
And make the month that brings the Best of Days,
Bring worst of nights?
Let Sleep knit up the ravelled sleave of Care;
Drive it not from me with your " Church Sells' Chime"
I 'm not a sheet, to need an extra air
In winter time.
"Beautiful Spring," intruding on my snore,
Comes down on Dreamland like a sudden blight;
A beautiful spring mattress pleases best
In dead of night.
I '11 let you " like a soldier fall," in fight,
Or 'nrath your tent in war-time lay your head;
But, please, in peace let me have out my night,
In my tent bed.
At least be sure that when, on Boxing Day,
Beadle and bell-ringer besiege my gate,
For clink of coin their music to repay,
The Waits may—wait!

PUNCH, OR TFTE LONDON CHARIVARI.

HOW WE MANAGE OUR LITTLE AFFAIRS OF THE HEART AT BRIGHTON.
SCHOOL-BOABDS AND SWINE.
Parochial Pig tqueaks—
THERE was a certain Shearer, on a time who chose to ply
His shears upon a pachyderm, the tenant of a stye:
With copious clamour and scant fleece his labour was repaid;
"Great cry and little wool," still lives, the saw in that case mide.
Great cry of " Education " rings on all sides in our ears,
But little wool that we can see for all the talk appears.
Whilst public men, declaiming, vent their platitudes outworn,
And Scnool-Boards fight, small scholars and Ratepayers are ihorn.
Good.Gentlemen and Ladies—for 'mongst rights of Womankind,
The right to sit on School-Boards now is won by strength of mind—
One question to your wisdom let your close-shorn Pigs commend;
That is, how much have you to show for all that you expend f
Nor deem them sordid swine if they another point propose,
As doubtful of the good and use for which their money goes.
With so much bricks-and-mortar, and sites for building bought,
And all that's spent in teaching, after all, how much is taught?
How much do you imagine that a Schoolboy, as a rule,
Learns from his masters, not at Board, but e'en at Boarding School?
Learns, to retain in after years, and turn to use and boot?
Inform us, you that teach the young idea how to shoot.
How much beyond those Rudiments, the R's in number three,
Learn ninety-nine in a hundred boys at a fair Acadeinie?
Beyond that useful triad what do the Million know?
Is it worth paying to drive more into small heads below?
What know the multitude of men whom boys at school you knew,
But the Three R's, if all the three, beyond the studious few?
And did you e'er bethink yourselves, fond mother, thoughtful sire,
How many of your little ones e'er more learning will acquire?
That question may have ne'er yet crossed tho philanthropic mind,
That looks to general good with eye to nearer objects blind.
With views enlarged, and thoughts beyond a narrower sphere that
roam,
Oft workers for the public weal omit the care of home.
And doth it much the public or parochial weal concern
That gutter children should be taught more than most home youth
learn P
Too much attempt not, if you 're wise: the million who 've to pay
The Education-tax don't like their money thrown away.
MORE CONFERENCES THAN ONE.
CONFERENCES are suggested on the following very urgent
Eastern questions:—
What can be done with the poor of Bethnal Green?
What improvements can be made in the lodging-houses of
Clerkenwell'(
What can be done for the education of the children of Shoreditch?
How can two-thirds of the Shadwell public-houses be closed?
What can be done to protect the Sailors of the Docks from
robbery P
How can a proper observance of Sunday be made popular in
Whitechapel?
How can feelings of equity be instilled into the bosoms of the
inhabitants of Houndsditch?
How can the London Fields be made capable of further improve-
ment?
How can " penny gaffs " be abolished?
How are the amusements of cheap Music Halls to be regulated?
How is the drainage to be improved in the poor neighbourhoods
near the Tower?
And, lastly, why are people more interested in the Turks of Bul-
garia than the Arabs of London?
Politics in the Pulpit.
IF the Liverpool Post has not been hoaxed, MR. SPURGEOST, the
other Sunday, took occasion to pray for a change of Ministers, and
said, "Let not the extraordinary folly of our rulers lead our
country into war." Should he not rather have prayed that they
might nave the extraordinary wisdom to keep us out of it V

SONGS FOE THE SLUMS.
SOMEBODY or other has been somewhere or other reported to have
said to somebody or other that, if he had the making of the songs o!
a nation, it would not matter much who had the making of its laws
Had Mr. Punch let fall this saying, there might have been some
truth in it; for not many Acts of Parliament can ever be so bene-
ficial to the British Nation as the poetry of Punch. Parliament
indeed, might quickly shut up shop if the country listened solely to
the wisdom of its Punch. But unluckily it happens that the songj
of Mr. Punch are not the only ones now published, and there n
abundance of good work in store for Parliament to counteract the
evil influence of the bad songs which are made.
Only fancy what egregious fools would sit in Parliament if the
law-makers of England were selected from the writers of its popular
street-songs! Imagine what a farce legislation would become if the
genius who produced, say, " Tommy, make room for your Uncle,"
were entrusted with the task of framing an amendment to the
Education Act, or of bringing in a Bill to codify our Civil Law!
And conceive what weighty wisdom from Punch and other law-
givers is required by way of antidote to the folly of the balderdash
squalled nightly at the Music flails, whence it quickly is exported
wholesale to permeate the slums.
As it is probable that LOBD BEACONSJTELD, or even MR. GLAD-
STONE, but seldom pays a visit to these places of amusement, we
think it well for his enlightenment, and that of other Legislators,
to put forth a few specimens of songs that might be popular at any
of our Music flails, if sung by vulgar singers and set to silly tunes.
(Specimen Kb. 1.)
"I'M SUCH A BASHFUL MAN!"
One day I strolled down Piccadilly,
Where a scrumptious Gal 1 met.
Her eyes they "d knock a feller silly;
Her hair it was as black as jet.
"By Jove!" thinks I, soon as I spied her,
"Here's good-bye to MART ANN !" m_,
And so next step I hopped beside her,
'Cos I 'm such a Bashful Man!
"Good morning, Miss," says I, politely.
"Does your Mammy know you 're out P"
Then I squoze her lingers tightly,
Which it made her lips to pout.
Her shawl I offered for to carry—
One should be civil when one can—
Then I axed her for to marry,
'Cos I 'm such a Bashful Man!
And jo OH, and so on, for a score or to of rerses, including the
encores, accompanied of course with many meaning winks and
gestures, and tumultuous applause.)
(Specimen No. 2.)
"SPANKING JOE."
I 'M a rollicking cadger as poor as a rat,
But I 'm bold as a badger, and 'cute as a cat:
1 'm a sweep by purfession, but prigging I do,
Which at Clerkenwell Session I ve made my debuo.
Chorus (in which (he enlightened audience join)—
Oh, ain't I just a jolly blade, the pace oh don't I go!
The gals all fall in love with me, they call me Spanking JOE!
With the gloves I 'm a wunner, I 'm up to all guards,
And you 'fl find me a stunner at forcing the cards:
1 'm a bit of a lusher, and when I 've a drop
I '11 knock any Crusher all over the shop!
Chorus (with rapture at this hit at the constituted authorities)—
Oh, ain't I just a jolly blade, the pace oh don't I go!
There ain't a Peeler has the pluck to face old Spanking JOE I
T attends all the races, I plays on the floot,
Like a Nigger's my face is, us black as a boot:
My address if you axes, of the street I 've the key,
And I don't pay no taxes, 'cept for corfy and tea.
Chorus (with a snapping of the fingers at the Tax-Collector)—
Oh, ain't I just a jolly blade, the pace oh don't I go!
Of Income-tax I ain't afraid, my fortin is too low!
(Specimen jVo. 3.)
"PRETTY POLLY POUTER."
PRETTY POLLY POUTER,
She's a reg'lar out-and-outer,
For she won a prize for beauty at a Barmaid Show:
She looks so 'ristocratic,
Though she lives in a back attic,
And her mother keeps a milk-walk in the slums of Pinilieo!
She can chaff a cove so sweetly,
She can tog herself so neatly;
She's a skirt of scarlet satin trimmed with poppies in full^blow:
And she sports a pink silk bonnet,
With blue butterflies upon it,
Which astonishes the milk-walk in the slums of Pimlico!
Since first I saw Miss POLLY
I 've been took quite melancholy,
For I asked her if she 'd have me, and she said,f' Oh, dear me, no!"
Now I feel my heart is blighted,
For I ne'er can be united
To sweet pretty POLLY POUTER in the slums of Pimlico!
Lord Salisbury's Mission.
IT is encouraging to have learnt, by various special telegrams,
that LORD SALISBURY'S Mission has prospered hitherto to the extent
of his Lordship's partaking of sixteen grand dinners, private and
official, during his progress to the East.
The postprandial result appears to have been equally satisfactory;
for a very special sub-manne telegram from Rome declares that
his Lordship's journey has "increased his hopes of the peaceful
result of the Conference."
It is almost superfluous to add that the telegram concludes by
stating, that our noble Representative at the proposed Conference
waste ''DINE" at eight o'clock with SIB AUGUSTUS PABET at the
Embassy at.Porta Pia.

Moral Biitterman. Not at the price, Miss; except our celebrated
"Bosh." We do know what that is made of. It is composed of
beef-fat and other harmless materials, together with a sufficient
amount of water.
Lady Customer. Oh, thank you! Good evening!
Moral Biitterman. Then you won't try the " Bosh," Miss? We

A BRITISH FETE TOR FRANCE.
THE Members of the French Senate, and Chamber of Depnties too, have lately received
a very acceptable present all round; to wit, a copy of MR. C. HILL'S prize essay, entitled
Sunday, containing an introductory letter by that prince of living letter-writers and polemics,
MR. GLADSTONE. This useful and appropriate gift was also accompanied by a letter from
the donors, the President and Secretary of the Committee of the Working Men's Lord's Day
Rest Association, on the part of that Society. The presentees are severally addressed as
follows:—
"SIB,—Will you do the Committee of this Association the honour of accepting the accompanying
little book, entitled Sttnd-iy: its Influence! on Health and National Proiperity f The observance of the
Sabbath Day has been an incalculable blessing to Great Britain, and it in the desire of the Working Men
and others connected with this Association to see their brethren and sister? in France enabled, like them-
selves, to enjoy the Sabbath as a day of rest from labour. We regret to learn that in France and other
Continental countries labour is carried on to a great extent on the Lord's Day, and we feel that if prac-
tical measures could be devised for promoting the observance of the Sabbath, and reducing the amount of
Sunday labour to that which is necessary, a great
blessing would descend on the French nation."
The above appeal has elicited the most
satisfactory answers. This is one of
them:—
Permit me, Gentlemen, to offer you
milliards of thanks for your valuable tract
on Sunday by the eminent HILL, in addi-
tion to one of the celebrated letters of yonr
incomparable Protestant ex-Minister, SIR
GLADSTONES.
It is admirable the zeal which, in the face
of grave preoccupations, has forced you to
engage your minds with the subject of
Sunday; and that for others who do not
think of it themselves.
One is astonished to see that British
Workmen, for whom the law has made the
Sunday after their nix days' labour a day
of repose, are not satisfied themselves to
rest and be thankful, but, besides, seek to
oblige people not at all sleepy to desist
from enjoying that festival by passing it in
their own way.
Still more amazed is one in find ing that
Workmen of Britain, for whom their in-
dustries might bo imagined employment
more than full, not only labouring out of
work hours to impose inaction during
Sunday upon their compatriots, but also
exhorting the French Legislature to in-
stitute throughout the whole of France the
British Sunday. One thinks that working
tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, bricklayers,
painters, plumbers, and glaziers would nave
quite enough to do to attend to their avoca-
tions, and busy themselves solely with their
needles, awls, saws, planes, axes, chisels,
hods, trowels, solder, paint, and putty. To
abandon their own business for the study
of our welfare is too generous.
It is your desire to see the enjoyment of
the Sabbath as a day of rest from labour
made compulsory on those whom you
affectionately call your brothers and sisters
in France. This is, indeed, a fraternal idea.
It is even more fraternal than Christian
fraternity. You wish your brothers and
your sisters to enjoy Sunday in the English
mode, and likewise to enjoy the Sabbath.
Consequently, vour fraternity embraces
also the Jews. Do you wish us all to enjoy,
in doing nothing, both the seventh day and
the first?
In England you are so happy as to have
no places of amusement open on Sunday
but the public-houses, and those shut
during hours of worship. It is your desire
to close them altogether for the whole day.
You would advise us also to shut up all
restaurants and refreshment-rooms, and.
as well, all galleries of art and science, and
every museum, to say nothing of theatres;
besides to prohibit all races, dancing, and
each possible kind of recreation on Sabbaths
and Sundays. That is how you invite us to
enjoy the Sunday and the Sabbath, and by
legislation to compel everybody else to do
the same. We thank you profoundly for
that so kind invitation, which, however, the
insuperable opinions and sentiments of the
French People compel us to decline.
Accept, Gentlemen, the assurance of my
distinguished consideration.

NOTES FROM OUR WELL-INFORMED MAN.
(Public and Confidential Addresses to the Editor.)
HESE are days, Sir. in
which a Journal is be-
hind the Times, and
behind the Telegraph,
too, for the matter of
that, if not posted up
not only in the latest
news, but also in such
details of private in-
telligence, highly -
spiced, pressed and
condensed, of course,
as may interest and
delight its millions
of readers, and place
them in that enviable
position recognised by
all as "behind the
scenes." As to the
pleasures and charms
of being " behind the
scenes, that will be
a subject for another
letter. But as a
paper is nothing with-
out its gossip, and
its scandal, allow me
to be your Gossip,
though heaven fore-
fend I should be your
Scandal.
I do not profess to
give anything politi-
cal—I may; rmt this
is not my object. I
shall not present you
with tit bits about our
dear BEACONSKBLD. No, Sir. Lejeu nevuutpas lachandelk. The
Jew is not worth the scandal, as Gwendolen might have said of Daniel
Deronda. Ah! why did not GEOROE ELIOI adopt the motto I
suggested to that talented Authoress :—
"C'est 1'amour, 1'amour, 1'amour,
Qui fait lo Dan'l Dertmda."
But perhaps it wasn't good enough for her. But to business. I
am Your Well-informed Man. I send this letter now on the spot,
because I happen to know that you will not get one from that flighty
Gentleman who goes about calling himself Your Representative.1'
"But that I am prevented by a severe cold," as the Ghost of
Hamlet's father said, "I could a tale unfold" about the above-
mentioned Contributor, which would make your quills stand on
end, like those of the fretful Porcupine.
By the way, what a voluminous writer the Porcupine ought to
be, if he *d only been brought up to it. But I suppose he never got
over the invention of steel pens?
I met Your Representative going off into the country with—well,
that's no business of mine, of course—only if he sends YOU any of
what he calls his criticisms (!! iy-on mv word, I can't find enough
notes of exclamation—for "admiration is not the word I want—
to express my intense astonishment at his unblushing effrontery),
you may take my word for it-^-and I '11 meet him anywhere after-
wards—coffee for two, and pistols for one (myself)—that he has
not been to the Theatre he professes to write about. As I am the
Well-informed Man, let me prove it. I will tell you what is doing
everywhere, and what is going to be done. You shall be with me a
privileged person behind the scenes.
Drury Lant.—MR. CHATTERTOW has determined upon producing
The Critic. The after-piece will be an Appeal to the Public; of
course, there will be no pantomime at this house.
The YOKES Family are staying at Hawarden, and ME. GLADSTONE
takes lessons in Sanskrit every morning, before breakfast, from MH.
FRED YOKES. In the Afternoon the ex-Premier,—or, as he is called
at Hawarden, the Axe-Premier,—goes about axing riddles and cut-
ting jokes for dinner.
At the Adelphi and Princess's, MR. WILLS, author of Charles, his
Friend, and other capital Faroes, will do the Pantomimes. He has
not yet chosen the subjects.
At the Folly.—It is whispered in my ear that MR. HEITRT IRVING
will appear here in a round of his favourite characters after Christ-
mas. The roof will be heightened, and the stage-door very consi-
derably enlarged to allow of his entrance. He .is to play in one
new piece adapted from the French, entitled Coutts qui Coutts.
Great things are expected—as they always have been.
MLLE. CHAUMONT has presented MB. E. PIGOTT, the Licenser of
Plays, with a new French Dictionary as a souvenir. There was
a private performance of Madame attend Monsieur at the LORD
CHAMBERLAIN'S Office. The part of Monsieur by the courteous and
amiable licenser.
MR. DAVID JAMES is engaged on a Volume of Sermons. He will
retire from the Stage after the 3,000th night of Our Soys. His
only objection to becoming a Clergyman is purely technical. He
says he cannot believe in the success of any Establishment that
admits Orders.
When I was in Dorsetshire, I heard that Temple Bar was coming
down, though by what train was uncertain. Besides these gems of
information, I could give you. several highly interesting and equally
true, about most of our Public Men, but I think the above are suffi-
cient to prove that I am what I profess to be,

THE TOOTH THAT WON'T COME OUT.

4,
THE RET. AKTHUK TOOTH, having been inhibited from playing
Mass by the Court of Arches, a " large and enthusiastic meeting
of hia habitual audiences was held at St. James's, Hatcham, the
other evening, "to protest against" his inhibition, "and to express
sympathy with him." According to the Post .—
"In moving the third resolution, which pledged the meeting to withhold all
moral, personal, and pecuniary support from any Priest' intruded into their
parish, MR. BOBBRT TOOTH, the patron of the living, observed that the
Vicar's conduct had been termed lawless, but it was not to be forgotten that,
.it the commencement of the proceedings, he had volunteered to submit to the
Bishop's decision, provided nil Lordship would try the matter in accordance
with the Church's laws."
Under which Church, Bezonian, speak or die? The Church
by law established, or the Church of which, in this country, the
top-sawyer is CJLEDTNAI. Miiwruo P The former, by the decree of
its highest Court, has declared ME. TOOTH to have proved himself,
in playing Mass, an unsound Tooth, a Tooth to be stopped, a Tooth
which, it stopping will not suffice, will have to come out. As to
the latter, it would simply disown MR. TOOTH, and declare his pre-
tension to play Mass improper, if not impious and condemnable.
The least serious of those ecclesiastics whom TOOTH takes off would
say that comedians go too far when they attempt 'chiesa buffa.
Apparently'Ms. TOOTH, like other English actors in his line of
business, does not know what he is about. He should learn. A
Divine whose writings a few years ago caused great commotion
in Kxoter Hall, might teach him; for at present, evidently, this
TOOTH is innocent o; the theology of DINS.

ACCORDING to the report of a lecture lately delivered by
DH. CHTLBS, F.R.C. S., under the auspices of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, at Tunbridge Wells, on "Vivi-
section, its Uselessness as well as its Unlawfulness," the Lecturer,
introducing his subject, "said that nothing more was wanted to
effect the total suppression of Vivisection than that the people at
large should have a clear notion of what Vivisection means."
Perhaps what he wished to say was merely that if people desired to
effect the total suppression of "Vivisection, it was necessary that
they should clearly Know what it meant. Now Vivisection means
cutting or maiming any living thing. So, if it were totally suppressed
there would be an end of butchers. As it is, we don't kill a pig
every day, but then we should never kill a pig any day. Hunting,
shooting, fishing, and all manner of field-sports, would be entirely
prohibited, and we should become a nation of Vegetarians.

GEOLOGICAL GENEALOGY.
JUDICIOUS ME. PUNCH, ScnarrrFTC SIB,
THE Order that I have the honour to belong to, is one
wherein much account is made of Pedigree. Ton know what a name
for high blood is borne by the descendants of the Godolphin Arabian.
Of course we are all descended from coevals of ADAH; but until
lately our origin was not supposed traceable any higher. Now,
however, it is referred to a prehistoric period of indefinitely remote
antiquity. Geological Genealogists ascribe a long lineage indeed to
the Noble Animal.
But, worthy Sir, in demonstrating our family to be as old as the
hills, or at least as the rocks or strata in which are found the bones
of our ancestors, some Gentlemen of Science do us a doubtful
honour. PROFESSOR HUXLEY, the other day, delivered at the
London Institution a lecture on "Some Recent Additions to our
Knowledge of the Pedigree of " my race. They consisted in certain
discoveries lately made of organic remains, imagined to warrant an
induction, which the Professor, in concluding his discourse, and
referring to the theory of " evolution," expressed as follows, if truly
reported:—
"There was no longer any other reasonable and fair hypothesis, and it
might truly be called an ascertained fact, that the rarioui form* of the horse
were all descended from a common ancestry. Just as certainly as there was a
point whence the horse and bear direrged, to there must hart been a common
point whence all mammals diverged."
So, then, PROFESSOR HUXLEY declares it a certain truth that we
Noble Animals are all remote cousins of that savage, ugly, ridicu-
lous, climbing, plantigrade brute, the Bear. Is it so certain? How
does he make it out r By showing that although, whilst the bear
has five toes, we have but one, only one bone, apparently, in the
fore leg to his two, and no more than forty-fourl teeth, he having
forty-six, yet on minute examination we are found to possess, in the
shape of " small splints" for toes, and an ulna " shrivelled to a
mere thread of bone," the rudiments that make up the Bear's com-
plement of bones, and that certain of our ancestors whose relics have
turned up in successive strata, exhibit these bones more completely
developed. To wit, in the Pleiooene, the Pleiohippus. an animal
like a horse, with differences as to teeth and bones, and the I'roto-
hippus or Hipparion, the latter having three really jointed toes; and
so upwards through the Meiocene beds with the Meiohippus or An-
chitherium, and the Mesohippus, with still more perfectly formed
toes to the Eocene, the oldest oed of the Tertiary system, and therein
the Orohippus with four complete toes to each fore foot; to each hind
leg three. This creature, PROFESSOR HUXLEY says, is no bigger
than a fox. he calls it the "Oldest Horse." Might he not rather
have called it the " Oldest Pony "?
Now, Mr. Punch, without presuming to contradict PROFESSOR
HUXLEY, allow me to ask, Do his premisses, as above quoted, clearly
necessitate his conclusion? What proof is there that we are
descendants of the Orohippus, indicated by some resemblance in
point of toes, to be conceivably a not very distant relation to the
Bear? Sir, I am ready to go at a five-barred gate or a bullfincher,
with anything on two legs, and that much weight on the back of
me; but one ought to be able to clear an acre of corn to match the
leap which the learned Professor seems to make in jumping to
conclusions like the foregoing.
Of course it was MR. DARWIN who put the idea of taking such
jumps as those into PROFESSOR HUXLEY'S head; but who put it into
MR. DARWIH'S? I don't know, Mr. Punch. I don't pretend to be
wise enough to say; but I cannot help suspecting that it was some
very profound Philosopher in the University of Laputa.
Believe me, dear Sir, your ever faithful and
Affectionate Friend and Servant,
HOUYHNHNM.
P.S.—Geology will, perhaps, by-and-by reveal a so-called horse
even older and smaller than the Orohippus, not so big as a Fox,
being no bigger than a Rat, and nearer still akin to the Bears and
the Sloths, to be called, possibly, the Microtherium, and supposed
to have done duty for the Horse in Prehistoric Lilliput.

Where bears forbear to make their lair,

LADIES, gentle Ladies, please to look at this:—
"In Manchester an influential movement has arisen for pro-

Surely, Ladies, you will wish this movement all

Ladies mostly congregate—an evil of long standing—
should be remedied forthwith. "They also serve," says
MILTON, "who only stand and wait." But, when serving

without the need of standing all day long; and what
fatigue she suffers from this "only standing-," they
only who have stood it can tell.

WHERE will it stop if such a precedent is admitted P We are told
that MtTiA-MB CHAUMONT herself called on the Censor of Plays, and
persuaded him to license the pieces she has lately so charmed us all
in performing. We can hear her saying, with that irresistible smile,
and that suggestive shrug of the shoulders, which we know and like
BO well, " rayons, man petit chou! Soit raisonnabte.' Fais-moi
cette petite concession! Pas moyen de me la refuser. Sein f"
And of course the merely human Licenser yields, as we should all
yield in his place.
But if this conduct should be catching? If every time a piece
was likely to be refused a licence, the Actor or Actress most
concerned were to seek a personal interview with the licenser, what
a life that unfortunate official would lead 1
Suppose Miss E. FARREN were to rush off to the Lord Chamberlain's
Office, and, popping her head in at the door, were to say, with a wink—
"Look here. Old Man! If you don't let me play that farce, I '11
strike you with a feather! I must have that fine in, or I '11 stab
you with a Wose I" And then, with a hop, step, and jump, perch
herself on the back of a chair, and inquire after the health of the
Governor—meaning the MARQUIS OF HERTFORD.
I Or] imagine MB. FEED YOKES, dissatisfied with the cuts made in
the next Christmas Pantomime, coming head-first through the
window in Palace Yard, and throwing his leg over the Censor's
astonished head, windmill-wise, until the lines were restored!
Then, again, MB. DAVID JAKES might repair to MR. PIGOTT'S
private residence, and, sticking a knife into the " Dptset" But
no; MR. DAVID JAMES will never require another licence. Has he
not sworn that succeeding generations shall take their boys to see
Our Soys till the end of the century?
Another day, MR. TOOLE might take it into his amusing noddle to
proceed, in a Hansom, to St. John's Wood, aud, bearding MR.
PIGOTT in his lair, might thus address him ;—
"Look here, my dear boy! You 've a licensed a good deal, and

my glove 1—I '11 trouble you to put those lines back where you took
'em from I And don't try it on again—not before this Boy! What
says the young OBADIAH? PIGOTT, my boy, you are on!"
Such licence on the part of the Profession would be inexcusable.
But we feel sure the present Censor knows how to keep the Stage in
order, without reducing himself to the necessity of maintaining a state
of siege alike of his premises and his principles.

MAJOR JAWLEY SHARP,
Author of " Squeezing Lanyford" " Two Kicks," <fr., S;c.
CHAPTEK III.—" The Jeddington Dodd Lot."

HE report that had so startled
them was soon explained by
MR. STBINGHALT, the accom-
plished Trainer. "We 've just
been firing a Colt," said MR.
STRINGHALT.
SIR THOMAS DODD was satis-
fied. "MR. SiRiNGtHiXT," he
said, addressing,jpe Trainer,
"Don't fire any ibbre Colts just
now, because of the Ladies."
"I won't, SIE THOMAS," was
the obsequious reply. "The
fact is, that this would not
have happened, only the fet-
lock caught in something, snapped, and the Colt went off of its own accord."
"Oh, do let us go all over the Stables!" exclaimed LADY Di BBITELEIGH,
rapturously.
"Oh, let's!" exclaimed MBS. ASOOOD AZAMTLE, not to be outdone by her
brilliant rival.
"How happy could I be with either!" murmured SIR THOMAS, as he, bent his
left eye on LADY Di, at the same time turning his right full on the attractive
MRS. AZAMYLE.
The HONBLE. PULLMAN CAEB frowned, and pinched COUNT FARRAGO'S arm, who,
not to be behindhand, retaliated with a kick.
The Jeddington training-stables were a marvel of neatness. They were most
conveniently situated between the house and the race-course, where SIR THOMAS
had won so many Derbys.
The Trainer beckoned to an elegant young man, who was lounging in a Japanese
arm-chair, in dressing-gown and slippers, inhaling one of the choicest bandannas
that money could procure. By his expansive shirt-front of the purest white,
which formed an admirable setting for his large diamond studs, anyone coula
immediately tell what capacity their wearer filled in these Stables. Evidently he
was the Stud Groom.
With an easy bow he advanced, and proffered his services as cicerone to the
party.
It was a thoroughly sporting scene, as MB. WILLIAM BUTTON (the Stud Groom)
pointed ont. In one corner there was a fine Dorking Hen laying the odds. In
another, a sleek-coated Race-Horse was backing himself against a wall. A dead
Mouse lay in the middle of the yard, and a fast-trotting Cob was walking over the
corse. The temperature was perfect, and the thermometer registered a dead heat.
MB. STBINGHALT'B family of ten children—all of them of such a decided
Japanese type as to have won them the name of "the Flat Race "—lived over the
Stables, and the butcher, who had just arrived, was carrying in the Nursery
Steaks; while MRS. STRINGHALT, a cheery, elderly woman, was putting the pot on.
Just outside, where the garden joined the yard, the gardeners were busily engaged
in hedging, and MB. STBXNGHALT'S eldest boy was trying to train a horse-chestnut
over a low fence; while the second was watching a caterpillar on a mulberry leaf,
and asking his brother, "Will it spin, OBADIAH? will it spin?"
"Now, said MB. WILLIAM BUTTON (who was as proud of the horses under his
care as a grandmother of her youngest grandchild), I will show you our Derby
pets. First of all, you shall see our Twentybob Mare."
He led the way towards the Pound.
"Twentybob in the Pound," said the Stud Groom,
admiringly. "And you won't get more change out of
anv horse than that.
Everyone admired her massive ribs, her short,
curved back, and her long silver tail.
"A little slipped in the forehand," observed the
HONBLE. PULLMAN CARR, quietly.
"You know, Sir, where the fault lies," returned
the Stud Groom, who had some respect for the
HONBLE. P.'s opinion.
And they walked on towards that peculiar building
which, in all training stables, is called the Mansion
House. Here they naturally expected to see the Mare.
They were not disappointed.
"Oh, how lovely!" exclaimed both Ladies,
pressing SIB THOMAS'S arm.
It was indeed a sight to rejoice the heart of any
true lover of Sport.
They were looking at a splendid Mare Iving in a
soft, downy Mare's Nest. She was absorbed in pro-
found thought, brooding over her lot. "She can't
help it," the Stud Groom observed. "She belongs
to the genuine stock of Brood Mares, and they all do
Suddenly a twittering carol of birds broke on their
Sara. The Ladies looked about amazed. There were
no feathered songsters visible.
The Stud Groom smiled. "It's the Thrushes the
March's always got. They sing on a fine summer
morning like this," the Trainer, who had now joined
the party, explained.
MR. STRINGHALT. the Trainer, might have added
that he encouraged musio in his stables. Outside,
a quintette of Grooms might have been observed with
their pipes, taking their time and their tune from
the Chief Ostler, who was giving it them with bis
pitchfork; while each horse lazily leaned back in his
stall, listening to the melody, and some few put
their heads out of their private boxes, and either
nodded affirmatively, or said " Neigh " distinctly.*
"Look here!" said the Trainer, drawing, their
attention to an animal in a box. "Here's one of
our Derby pets. This is the Invisible Prince, out of
Sight, by Jingo."
She was a beautiful bit of skin was this brood-
foal. Her legs were long and sinewy, with a good
round, firm, swelling knee, well curved outwards—a
sign that there was no bend sinister in her pedi-
gree. Her left hock was still, her right hock was
sparkling, just the sort you 'd expect in a winner of
a Champagne cup. Her shoxilders drooped a little,
giving the notion of extraordinary force and great
staying power. This was the one point that SIR
THOMAS went for with all his might and main. By
the provisions of the will he was compelled not only
to lose, but to come in absolutely last of all, for three
Derbys in succession. Hitherto all his horses would
win. If he could but find one mare with sufficient
staying power to stay behind all the others, his
estates were secure to him for the rest of his life.
Therefore, on the Invisible Prince all SIB THOMAS
DOLD'S hopes were centred^
LADY Di could not restrain her admiration.
'' She has a tail of which a rat might be proud," she
cried, enthusiastically.

"And something of the Hebraic in it." added SIB THOMAS ;_ "or,

this peculiar breed, has long been the distinguishing mark of the

"We have another Derby mare," observed MB. WILLIAM BUTTON.
carelessly. "She is named Moka, by Sawney Beanie, out of
Chicory; at least, that is how I have entered her in the Registry.
She is handsomely marked, you'll observe," he added, as he
opened a small lattice in order to allow the visitors to get a peep at
the animal in question. "Sh« has the true length and delicate
acuteness of ear, and the two dark stripes on the shoulders, which
are the genuine signs of great staying and much enduring power.
Should Invisible Prince fail, it is quite on the cards for Moka to
lose a Derby for us. I have taken her in hand myself," added MR.
BUTTON, with some pride. H« tiad originally been in a Cirque, and
it would have taken a clever quadruped to show him in a quarter of
an hour more tricks than he could teach any one of them in five
minutes.
The stable-gates were thrown open, and a young lady drove in.
She was radiant as the morning, and wore a Gainsborough hat of
magnificent dimensions.
"GCSSY GANDAB!" exclaimed SIB THOMAS, and in another
minute they were locked in each other's arms, while the rest of the
party were.oonsiderably shut up. When they were unlocked, Miss
GUSSY and Bra THOMAS went up to the House, skipping like a young
heir and heiress in March, quite oblivious of the party they had
left behind in the stable.
"Andiamo!" said COUNT FABBAGO, shrugging his shoulders.
"Cospetto.' II Bacio! Corpo di Baccy!" And the good-
natured foreigner lit a cigar, and strolled in the direction of New-
market.
MRS. ASGOOD AZAMTLE sui/eil the 111 >N m.n. PULLMAN CABB by the

He must not marry her.'" they both hissed in his ears. For a
time jealousy of a common object had united the rivals. But GUSST
was no common object. The HONBLK. I'I'LLHAIT CABB felt this
strongly.
"I must have the estate, and SIB TOMMY DODD must win three
Derbys in succession. Whatever happens, the Invisible Prince
must not come in last. Yet, with such legs, and such a marvellous
staying power, how can it be prevented? Tne question is, who will
be put up to nde? and can I jet at him? Who will it be P
lfl!" said a low, distinct voice, issuing from a dark corner.
The Ladies started to their feet. They had been previously on
their knees, imploring the HONBLE. PULLMAN.
A tall man, far over the average height, and burly in proportion,
weighing thirty stone if h« weighed a pound, stood before them.
He was dressed in full jockey costume, including armour-plates,
which, owing to the provisions of the will necessitating weight
carrying to any amount, constituted the d* rigutur racing attire of a
Tommy Dodd Boy.
"Who are you?" asked the HONBLE. PULLMAN.
"My name is CAVASSON," answered the warrior-like figure, "and
I am the Dumb Jockey* of Jeddington."
The Ladies screamed, for at that moment they caught sight of a
brilliant pair of keen, eager eyes watching them through the stone
wall. To clear this at a bound was, with the 1 ION RLE. PULLMAN,
the work of a moment.
(To In continue*.)

know. I am but anticipating an objection on th« part of the readers. Yours

WORDS WITHOUT SONGS.
HE presence of a
popular singer
(whose appear-
ances are a little
uncertain) was, a
short time since,
announced in a
certain provincial
town by placards
bearing the in-
scription, "Ma.
80 - AND - So has
arrived." Should
this idea be de-
veloped, we may
hope to see a
column in the
country papers
devoted to a series
of announcements,
framed after the
following , fash-
ion:—
(By Telegraph
from Our Own
Correspondents.)
LONDON, 10 A.M.
SIGNOB TOMP-
, the celebrated basso-profondo, has just reached the station in
a Hansom-cab. He isjiow engaged in securing a first-class ticket
for Jewsborough-on-the-Sea. He is expected (by the porter in
charge of his railway rugs and hat-box) to travel down to Jews-
borough-on-the-Sea in a smoking compartment.
LONDON, 1010 A.M.
SIGNOB TOMPKINT has just started. He called for a newspaper,
and his voice seemed to be in excellent order. The porter was right.
The celebrated Singer is travelling in a smoking-compartment.
MUDBOBOUGH STATION, 11 A.M.
The train containing SIGNOB TOMPKINI has just arrived here. He
has asked the guard at what time the train is expected to reach
Jewsborough-on-the-Sea. He seems to be in excellent voice. He
is smoking a Manilla-cheroot. A medical man has just informed
me that he has seen the celebrated Singer (through the carriage
window), and thinks it highly probable that he will be able to keep
bis engagement at the Concert to-night. Train started.
CLAYBHAM-ON-THE-NOOZE, 12 NOON.
The London train has come in. SIGNOB TOMPKINI has just left it
to get a sandwich. He asked for a glass of sherry. His " Upper
G " seems to be as fresh as ever. Some anxiety was felt lest he
should change his mind, and return to town by the next train.
Now, happily, all doubts are set at rest. He has returned to his
smoking-compartment, and has lighted a cigarette.
WALKANTALXLNGTON STATION, 1 P.M.
Amidst great excitement the Tompkini Train has arrived at the
platform. The celebrated Singer is still in his carriage. He has
been heard by a fellow-passenger in the next compartment (listening
through the communication-window), to sing a few bars of " Tommy
Make Room for Your Uncle." He is said to be in excellent voice.
From this point two detectives will accompany him on his progress.
They will travel in the next carriage (a second-class one) to that
occupied by the Signor.
CHAWD JUNCTION, 2 P.M.
The train has arrived. SIGNOB TOMPKINI has not as yet escaped.
The guard has been bribed to lock hi™ in. The celebrated Singer,
finding he could not open the door, called to the station-master for
assistance. He seemed to be in excellent voice—his "Lower A"
being most impressive. Great anxiety was felt lest he should escape
to Bangerville on the other line. However, all is well. The train
has started with the Signor. The detectives (who consider their
present task one of the most difficult ever confided to their care), are
in good spirits. They seem to be confident of success.
JEWSBOBOUGH-ON-THE-SBA, 3 P.M.
Glorious news! The Signor has just arrived, and has put up at
the Royal Hotel. Unless he changes his mind at the last moment,
there is every reason to believe that he will positively sing this
evening.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH'S GUIDE TO THE ARMY.
SECTION VIII. AND LAST.—CONCERNING PALL MAIL.
HEN Mr. Punch met his
pupils in the ante-room,
the face of the sage was
sad. "My friends," said
he, "the moment has
arrived when we must
part. I have shown you
during the course of these
lectures how to enter the
Army, and how to behave
in it when honoured with
a place in the Army List.
And surely that is enough.
COLONEL CHARLES of the
Royal East Mudborough
Militia, stealthily brushed
away a tear, ENSIGN
EUGENE, of the Volun-
teers, blew his nose with
unusual energy, and even
LIEUTENANT AND CAPTAIN
GEORGE of the Grenadiers
(Green) was affected. As
for little SIR FRANK
GEEGEE, K. C. B., he
whined in the most dis-
mal manner possible.
"Why leave off?" asked
the four pupils together. "Because, my friends," replied Mr.
Punch, a Guide to the Army appearing in the leading English
paper (for my lectures are reported in the London Charivari), might
be considered at such a time as this,.as threatening to the peace
of Europe. Foreigners might imagine that we were going to arm
in earnest." "You are quite right," returned COLONEL CHARLES.
"I had given permission to the Band of the Royal East Mud-
borough Militia to play at an amateur performance. The permis-
sion shall be withdrawn. "We cannot be too careful in avoiding
the chance of an imputation of making demonstrations in force."
And then for the last time Mr. Punch addressed his pupils as the
Teacher of the Army.
Parti. The Horse Guards. The Executive of the Army is to
be found in a number of houses in Pall Mall. The houses opposite
the Rag and Junior Carlton belong to the War Office and the Horse
Guards. A small building in St. James's Square is quite large
enough to contain the Intelligence Department of the Service. The
War Office, like an official Octopus, has branches in the neighbour-
hood 'of Spring Gardens, but these branches are not of much im-
portance. The two great Establishments of the Executive are the
Horse Guards and the War Office.
The Horse Guards is called, at the present moment, the Horse
Guards, because it has nothing whatever to do with the Horse
Guards. It is supposed that the name was originally given to the
Department because a former Commander-in-Chief swore until
everything was "Blue." This must have been very many years
ago, because no modern Commander-in-Chief has been known to
use any stronger expression than " oh dear me!" and this only at
times of great excitement.
The mission of the Horse Guards is to quarrel with the War
Office, Although next-door neighbours, every kind of moral im-
pediment is placed as a barrier in the dark passage which leads from
the one to the other. The War Office has not always been able to
maintain the reputation of being Civil. The Horse Guards has
never been anything but Military. Two immense Grenadiers are
crammed under a portico at the entrance, and the hall looks more
like a Guard-room than a Government Office. The Messengers are
Soldiers, and the Chiefs of the Departments are Soldiers, too.
Scarlet meets you on every side, and appropriately the work of the
Horse Guards consists chiefly of Red Tape.
The Commander-in-Chief has many duties. It is he who decides
upon the adoption of a new button—of course, after obtaining the
sanction of the Secretary of State for War. It is he who arranges
about the Peace Campaigns of the Forces—of course, after obtaining
the sanction of the Secretary of State for War. In fact, it is he who
commands the Army—of course, after obtaining the sanction of the
Secretary of State for War. From this it will be seen that the
Commander-in-Chief (or, to be more exact, the Officer Commanding-
in-Chiet) is an Independent Official of the very last importance.
And yet at times ill-feeling is said to exist between the Commander-
m-Chief and the Secretary of State for War. If the Soldier claims
the authority, the Civilian holds the money; if " the DUKE " wants
this done, "MR. So-AND-So " would be delighted to oblige him if the
Nation would only afford the expense.
Under these circumstances certain rude people have suggested
that the Horse Guards in its present conditioji is not quite so useful
an Institution of the Country as it might be made to be.
Part II. The War Office.—The War Office is quite a different
place. A solitary Sentinel guards the roomy court-yard. The hall
is full of obliging Messengers of the homely type—portly, grey-
haired, ani intensely unmilitary. The waiting-room is decorated
with an oJ4 Picture of the Judgment of Solomon, some spirited
Lithographs. or Provincial Hotels, a List of Newspapers, a Book
from a House Agent, and the Programme of the Royal Polytechnic
Institution It is in this cheery, unconventional apartment that
Deputations are collected together, and hard-worked Clerks have
little chats with their friends on "private business." If you wish
to see MR. TENTEBFOUH, a Boy carries up your name oh a slip of
paper to the proper. Department, and, owing to the intelligence and
activity of the youthful Mercurius, you are kept in suspense for the
appearance of the genial TENTERFOUR seldom less than ten minutes
and sometimes more than two hours. And isj not this as it should
be P Is nqt the apartment a waiting-room P
The War Office dejights in Forms'for the transmission of business.
Scarcely an Army List is published that does hot contain at least
half-a-dpzen Forms to be tilled in and sigtied by one Officer and
countersigned by another. Mr. Punch, always anxious to be
practical, begs to submit to Officers of the Army the most useful
Form of all. If aa Officer is a good fellow, and has been up to
Town, he is sure to have met a Man'in the War Office. Of this Man
he should make a Friend, and, once having secured him as a Friend,
he can use the following document as occasion may require :—
FORM FOR OBTAINING AN EXCHANGE, GETTfafO SPECIAL LEAVE,
AND OTHER FAVOURS.
Mr DEAR OLD MAN,
You are such an awfully kind old Fellow, that I don't
mind bothering you a bit. Although I admit it is a little rough
upon+outo be always asking you to be doing something or other.
But tSe fact is, I .want—[Here insert ichat you want.] lam sure
you will got it managed for me if you can. If you see BILLY, give
him my love.
F: R. 0. M. TENTERFOUR, ESQ.
Mine ever,
TOMMY D'ATKINS.
If this does not get you what you need, all Mr. Punch can say
is, that he knows very little of the kind-heartedness of those most
obliging and most hard-working of Officials — the Clerks at the
War Office.
CONVERSATION ON SECTION VIII.
Ensign Eugene. My dear Mr. Punch, before you go, cannot you
tell us something about foreign Armies?
Mr. Punch. My dear ENSIGN EUGENE, of the Volunteers, I made
up my mind only to deal with our own Forces. But, to oblige you.
I can hint that the Russians have several million Soldiers; but or
these several millions only a few hundred thousands really exist.
The rest are merely efficient—on paper.
Colonel Charles. The German Landtcehr is a sort of Militia, is
it not?
Mr. Punch. Yes, my dear Colonel. PRINCE VON BISMARCK has
recently declared that peace between England and Germany has
been the tradition for centuries. Under these circumstances it is
highly improbable that the English Militia will ever meet the
German Militia in deadly combat. This will, of course, be very
lucky for—the weaker Militia.
Lieutenant and Captain George.—And. what, Sir, is the strength
of the British Army P
Mr. Punch. My good Friend, I will answer your question, and
bring my lectures to a conclusion, with the assertion that the strength
of the British Army may be summed up in the words, "unlimited
pluck."

OUE REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(He addretses the Editor, and hat something to say about a revival
at the C»urt Theatre.)
SIR,
I WILL make no comment on the statement about myself in
in the letter from your " Well-informed Man " (!) which appeared in
your pages last week. There will be a settlement injjituro for that
ast in prasenti. I will come to Hecuba at once. "What I have to
say, if you will allow me to say it, is of more general importance, at
least to that section of the " Theatre-going public," which delights
in showing its appreciation of a good English Comedy, correctly
"mounted," and intelligently played throughout. Such an oppor-
tunity has been recently afforded to all interested in the well-being
of true Dramatic Art by the revival—in these days of Revivalism—
of New Men and Old Acres at the Court Theatre. Let me paren-
thetically remark that I fail to see why the fact of MR. DUBOUHQ'S
collaborateur in this play being "one of Ours" should preclude
Your Regular Representative from bestowing on this play, in this
journal, that attention which it certainly would have otherwise re-
ceived, had its authors' names been the BROTHERS ROWE, or MESSRS.
HOOK AND CROOK, or anything else instead of MESSRS. TAYLOR AND
DUBOURG. I think the occasion demands it, for the play itself is a
lesson in the art of comedy-writing to those who err, either through
an unreasoning admiration of the school of French Modern Comedy,
or through an over-estimation of what may be termed the "Robert-
sonian Style," as once seen, in its perfection, at the Prince of "Wales's.
Not having seen;JVetc Men and Old Acres when first produced at the
Haymarket, the play is, to me, a novelty. This, however, affects
the actors, not the play. First, it has a very simple but thoroughly
interesting plot, clearly and .intelligently told through the media
of good dramatic situations, always natural, never forced, and of
sohd, nervous English dialogue, which, if it seldom flashes with
epigrammatic brilliancy, possesses at least the rare merit of being
invariably in keeping with the individuality of the person who utters
it, while never once sinking to the level of commonplace, it is not
at any time either tedious or uninteresting.
The right people say the right things at the right moment, and,
though there is scarcely what is too often now-a-days considered as
a "pointed line"—meaning a line that pricks and pains—in the
Play, yet every line is to the point. To any one who has seen
Our Soys, it will be evident how easily the part of the parvenu.
Hunter, unable to manage his aspirates (like MR. BYRON'S Hutter-
man— and 'full of pious sentiments—like Aminadab Sleek, in
The Serious Family), might have been exalted into undue promi-
nence for the sake of "getting laughs" in the cheapest manner
possible at the expense of the more serious interest of the Play, that
is, to the ruin of the Comedy. The Hunter family might have been
made to draw the Town, but New Men and Old Acres would then
have been a Three-Act Farce. It seems to me that the collabora-
teurs are entitled to great praise for their firmness in resisting what
must, at some time or other, have presented itself as a most alluring
temptation; secondly, the two contrasted love-scenes in the Second
Act are admirable. Here is no straining after the "idyllic," no
hard-working efforts at pumping up buckets full of sentiment, no
despairing struggle, as we meet with in ROBERTSON'S imitators, to
win the languidly gushing "ftuite-too-charming-and-oh-so-mce-
don't-yon-know" sort of praise from the affected babblers of the
Effeminate Admiration Society. From beginning to end the Comedy
is an honest Comedy, purely English, and Englishly pure, free from
all suspicion of offence.
It may be hypercritical to point out a speck, but that the livery-
servant at the Hunter's should be called "Montmorency " does seem
to Your Representative a slip of the collaborateurs1 pen, like
DICEENS'S page-boy, Augustus, who "had plain BILL stamped on
every line of nis countenance, The livery-servant, Montmorency,
would have been perfectly in keeping with one of ME. TOOLE'S
Farces, and, therefore, is quite out of place in New Men and Old
Acres.
With Miss ELLEN TERRY not a fault is to be found. Lilian is
the best thing, far and away, that she has yet done. She has an

HAWK v. FALCON.
THE gratitude of all narrators of anec-
dotes and quoters of facetious sayings and
witticisms, the thanks especially of.diners-
out having to entertain their company, are
eminently due to the LORD CHIEF BABON
for his recent ruling in the Exchequer
Division of the High Court of Justice, as
to the privileges of Counsel. Aggrieved
by a certain statement made by MB. NAPIER
HIGGINS, Q.C., during he conduct of a case
before VICE-CHANCELLOR MALDTS, MB.
LEWIS, in eminent Solicitor, brings an
action for malicious defamation against
ME. HIGGINS. Though "hawks." as a rule,
"winna pick out hawks' een, yet a So-
licitor can occasionally sue a Barrister.
The CHIEF BABON ruled that, as the words
complained of were spoken by MB. HIG-
HINS in his character of Counsel before a
Judge in a Court of Justice, an action on
account of them could not be maintained,
whether they were false or true. Like
a thing of beauty, a good joke is a joy for
ever, and will bear endless repetition, not
everywhere, not, for example, ordinarily
in these pages, but always in proper time
and place. Now only consider what would
have Happened had the LOBD CHIEF BABON
laid down the law contrariwise to the effect
foregoing? Counsel would have been, and
would remain for ever debarred from the
practical repetition of that capital old joke,
once embodied in a brief, for its brevity a
brief indeed: "No case—abuse the plain-
tiff's attorney." But now and henceforth,
as the law declared by the CHIEF BABON
stands, an advocate acting in his pro-
fessional capacity remains privileged and
entitled to abuse the Attorney on the oppo-
site side, or any other Attorney or Solicitor,
or person ad libitum, without fear, and
with perfect impunity. Hooray, Brother
Buzfuz, for the LOBD CHIEF BABON!

opportunity of showing her rare command of the lighter and graver
notes of emotion. She is as true in the one as the other. Nor do I
think too great praise can be awarded to MBS. GASTON MTTBBAT for
her performance of Lady Matilda, the presiding genius of the family,
the far-seeing fashionable mother with a daughter to marry. The
Authors have placed her in sharp contrast with the vulgarian Mrs.
Hunter; but there would have been great inducement for a less
conscientious artist to lose sig^ht of the contrast, and to have estab-
lished a rivalship. A very little exaggeration and the part would
have degenerated into a mere colourless repetition of the hackneyed
stage type of the scheming mother and over-bearing wife, which
found its place in ROBERTSON'S Society in the person ot Lady Ptar-
migan, mated to that impossible aristocratic dormouse, which in
MB. BABE'S hands was one of the "hits" of that amusing and
excellent after-piece, the first of the great successes, in the early
days of MB. and MBS. BANCROFT'S reign.
By the way, I should imagine that the part of Lord Ptarmigan
was not much, if at all, longer than that of Marmaduke Jravasour
in this piece. To have little or nothing to do in a play, and yet to
impress the audience with the idea that the performance would be,
somehow, incomplete without you, is an artistic triumph on which,
in the present instance, MB. HABE is to be congratulated.
MB. KELLY'S honest, upright, generous, but rather inarticulate,
Liverpool Merchant,—calling to mind occasionally the character of
John Mildmay, in Still Waters—is as thorough an impersonation
as can be seen on any stage, ;French or English. MB. ANSON'S
Hunter will be justly appreciated by those who saw biminBrothers.
Most carefully does ho avoid the pitfalls into which the broad Low
Comedian might so easily tumble. MB. ERSSEB JONES'S German
adventurer is a capital bit of character; and MB. CATHCABT
might be trusted as a Solicitor off the Stage, so totally unlike is he
to the conventional Stage Attorney. MBS. STEPHENS, with her bad
grammar and malapropisms, is as amusing as she was in The Ticket
of Leave. MB. CONWAT seems a trifle too old, too knowing,
and too manly for Sertie, though it would be difficult to mention
any one who could fill the part better. Miss KATE ATTBBET, in her
anxiety to give a stamp of originality to the character of Fanny
Hunter, shows a slight tendency to exaggeration, which is, perhaps,
under the circumstances, pardonable. And so, Sir, I have done.
You may probably disagree with me on many points; but differences
of opinion will never deter me from signing myself now as ever,
YOUB REPRESENTATIVE.
P. S.—Wouldn't that last line, beginning with "differences of
opinion," &o., make a good exit speech? I shall register it.
SPIRITUALISM AND SWINDLING.
PENDING the SLADE prosecution, it may be unsuitable to discuss
the question whether a Medium, in accepting fees for any consider-
ation whatsoever alleged to be spiritual, receives money under false
pretences. Some people think ne doesn't: others think he does.
What will the latter say to the following telegram from Rome :—
"The Unitd Catholica announces that the widow of the DUKE DEGALLIERA
has laid the »um of 1,000,000 francs at the feet of the Holy Father, in the
names of herself and her son PHILIF. imploring the Apostolic benediction on
the suffering soul of her deceased husband."
Unless the foregoing intelligence is a dish of wild duck, a point to
be mooted is whether the tender of the sum therein mentioned was
accepted, and His Holiness has got the money. If so, let us trust
that he is a Medium who really believes in his own mediumship of
communication with the spiritual world, and in the efficacy of his
benediction to benefit suffering souls in it.

IN EXPLANATION.
IN his number of December 2, Punch published, under the head
of "True or Untrue," some lines on the death of EHMA BLACK,
alleged to have been caused by her being shut in a dark cupboard al
the Southwark Board School.
The lines did not endorse the allegation, but pointed it out as one
for inquiry. Punch is glad to learn that before the lines were pub-
lished, a Committee of the School Board had made an inquiry into
the case, and found—
1. That the child's death was due to natural causes.
2. That there was no evidence, beyond the statement of the
Mother, that the child was ever shut into a dark closet at the school,
though the Coroner's Inquest was adjourned for a week to allow of
such evidence being produced.
3 That such evidence as was produced of other children having
been put in a dark closet in the same school related to a time before
the present Mistress was appointed.
4. That the Mistress now in charge of this infant school, Mrss
BARKETT, is a kind and gentle person, much liked by the children
under her charge.
When the London School Board is so 'jealously watched and so
larshly criticised, Punch feels it a duty on his part to give all the
publicity he can to the fact that, in a case which seemed to call for
nquiry, the Board promptly made such inquiry, and were able to
exonerate the schoolmistress of the Southwark Infant School from
any responsibility for the death of EMMA BLACK.
PUNCH'S PARTY WOED-BOOK.
WITH a view to the enlightenment of unsophisticated and, there-
fore, frequently puzzled perusers of Party outpourings, whether
From the press or the platform, Mr. Punch has prepared the
Following definitions and explanations of some of the chief words
nnd phrases in the verbal armoury of the Party Controversialist.
The personal pronouns in these cases will, of course, be understood
to refer to the person speaking or writing, none other being worthy
of consideration—from the Party point of view.
All reasonable and respectable People—Ourselves.
Everybody— That portion of the community, small or great,
which sides with us.
Nobody—Everybody who holds or expresses opinions antagonistic
to ours.
The Opinion of the Country—This is arriyed at by an exceedingly
simple arithmetical process, namely, by subtracting the views of
"Nobody" (in the aoove sense) from those of "Everybody" (as
before defined).
Common-Sensn—The opinion common to all those who agree
with us.
Patriotism—0\u views of the interests and duties (especially the
former) of our country. Of this quality we have, from the very
necessity of the case, an exclusive monopoly. A claim to any share
fo it on the part of others may be described indifferently as "blind
philanthropy," mischievous humanitarianism," or "bigoted
fanaticism.
Ji/atiuit Conceit—The impression, on the part of our opponents,
that they hare a right, equally with ourselves, to opinions of their
own.
Well-meaning but Misguided People—Persons whom it may be
desirable to depreciate, but impolitic to abuse.
Pestilent and Pretentious Sciolists—Persons of precisely the same
way of thinking or speaking, who may be attacked with impunity.
Spouting—A depreciatory epithet for all talk but our own.
Nottrum—The specific of a rival prescriber.
Faction—Departure from our pet programme.
The Herd—The World minus our clique.
Imperial Interest—Natural Selfishness—with a big 8.
Humanitarianism—A scornful synonym for any form of humanity
that happens to run counter to " Imperial Interest."
Intelligent Public Spirit—Open advocacy of our views.
Fatuous Fussiness—Public advocacy of any others.
Atrocity—Venal errors on the part of our clients.
Ferocity—The indignation of those who dare to denounce them.
Sentiment—The root of all—political—evil.
Inverted Commas—A mechanical, but compendious and invalu-
able—because unanswerable—method of tacit perversion and mute
depreciation. What a shrug is to a scandal-monger, Inverted
Commas are to a superfine critic.
The list might be indefinitely extended, but the principles of
interpretation here enumerated will be found to apply to wide fields
of contemporary controversy. Read in the light of these principles,
many journalistic Jeremiads will be found more intelligible, if
perchance less edifying.
From. Psycho to Gastro.
FBOM a recently reported lecture, it appears'that the Loan Col-
lection at South Kensington contains an artificial stomach, capable
of actually digesting food. If it can really perform that function,
there will then indeed be occasion for "no more pills, or any other
medicine" at present requisite for the relief of dyspepsia. The
artificial stomach will form a supplement to, or indeed mainly, a
substitute for, artificial teeth. It will supply the want of invalids,
who complain that their stomach is all gone, and thus virtually,
though not anatomically, replace the real stomach. The artificial
stomach may be safely pronounced a real blessing to Aldermen.

A BEAUTIFUL country of the greenest trees and the smoothest turf.
Birds singing in the bushes. A cloudless sky reflected in the clear

The horses the hnest of their breed—gently nurtured and kindly
ridden. The course a good old English cross-country road o'er turf

The spectators, the fairest and the bravest of the land—beautiful

A PICTURE FOUNDED'UPON FACT.
A MISERABLE swamp—mud and stunted bushes trodden" under
foot by hob-nailed boots. The barking of curs and the shouts of
drunke» men. A few deep puddles of the dirtiest of dirty water.
Nature at her worst.
The horses miserable creatures, scarcely worthy to crawl between
the shafts of a broken-down hackney-cab or a superannuated
bathing-machine.
The course a narrow road, through mud and slush, over cruel
stone-heaps and break-neck " brooks "—a course meant to put both
necks and backs in jeopardy, to maim, if not to kill, the riders and
the ridden.
The spectators the foulest of the foul—bold, and brazen-
faced, painted, loud and licentious women, the shame of their sex;
the men brutal and low-browed, full of oaths and blasphemy;
miserable shop-boys, with pockets full of stolen coin; burglars
and thieves; drunkards and blacklegs; rags of the frowsiest
covering rogues of the blackest and deepest dyes.
The patrons, sellers of strong drink. Drink adulterated and bad.
Drink blunting the senses of some, and leaving them helpless logs
upon the muddy road. Drink exciting the passions of others, and
turning dull brutes into wild beasts, pickpockets into highwaymen,
bullies into murderers.
The place the curse of the neighbourhood.
In short, the picture of a suburban hell!

A PATTERN TO PARLIAMENT.
MR. SPEAKER, the Assembly over which you so ably preside has ever appeared reluctant
to add to or alter those traditional usages of which you, Sir, are the official exponent. Yet,
pardon the suggestion that the British House of Commons might, as advantageously for
the Public as agreeably to Honourable Members, above all to yourself as the moderator, and
more often than not, perhaps, the endurer, of their debates, take a leaf, or even leaves,
out of the book of another Parliament—that of Fatherland. A column of recent German
news in a contemporary has perhaps informed you that:—
"The German Parliament is devoting part of the time of iU last Session to the testing of various articles
of public interest. About a week ago some zealous Pisciculturists arranged an exhibition of German
fishes, which was succeeded by a ' Parliamentary
fish dinner," in which specimens of the species
exhibited were served up cooked for gastronomic
examination.",
Is not this, Sir, a way of winding up the
Session in every respect preferable to that
of polluting its fag-end with the Massacre
of the Innocents—a massacre necessitated
by previous hindrance to despatch of busi-
ne«s? The German Parliament at the close
of its sittings has time on its hands, the
G»rman Parliament does not throw away
night after night in prolix debates, of which
th» greater part end in nothing; still less does
it sacrifice one day every week to fanatics
and crotcheteers. If in these particulars
the British House of Commons would take
pattern from a more thinking and less
loquacious Legislature, might it not also
have time possibly to pass all needful Bills,
and then, having finished political work,
have leisure enough to occupy its closing
days with darliamentary pinners for the
discussion of good things r Although in
the month of August there is no It, you
might yet have oysters on the table — at
any rate, as a question of supply; and you
could, on any day, combine the consideration
of the cost of meat with its consumption.
After dinner, in further pursuance of
Teutonic precedent, would ensue smoke, the
House becoming actually a " Tobacco Par-
liament."
See. further, Sir, how much more wisely
they deal with a certain " burning " ques-
tion in another Collective Wisdom :—
"And very shortly a parliamentary testing of
German wines is to take place, for which German
winegrowers have contributed a selection of the
best home-grown wines little short of a thousand
bottles. The act of testing is to be made the
occasion of another Parliamentary dinner."
Consider, Sir. how much more sensible it
is to deal with the Liquor Question by
dining upon it, than by squandering
Wednesday after Wednesday in wasting
breath upon Sabbatarian Sunday Closing
and Teetotallers' Coercion Bills? In order
to make people sober by Act of Parliament,
would not the soundest legislation consist
in measures to secure them sound wine and
sound beer'{ May you be destined, Sir, to
see the House of Commons resolve itself
into many a good dinner-party on purpose
to test claret, burgundy, and all manner of
wine, as well as ale, beer, and other
generous and exhilarating liquors; and
may you yourself perpetually preside over
the banquet as Speaker and Symposiarch.
THE SPECIFIC FOR SCURVY.
WHAT, no lime-juice? And so the
gallant fellows on the Arctic Expedition
were seized with scurvy, and had to return
before their time. And why no lime-juice Y
Some plead that it is spoilt or impaired in
virtue by getting frozen, also that sailors
don't like it, and shirk taking it, so as to
require Officers to stand over them and
make th«m drink it. How are these diffi-
culties to be overcome? By due admixture
of distasteful lime-juice with agreeable
rum and sugar. Add, perhaps, a dash of
equally agreeable brandy. Then wouldn't
the lime-juice go down the nautical red
lane? To be sure—and there would be
your remedy of remedies for scurvy. What
cures the gout, the colic, and the phthisic?
What is it that's allowed to be the very
best of physic for ev«ry ^possible human
ailment, including Scurvy? Punch!
CHAUCER for Children! Surely a Spenser
would have been more fitting.

WHAT'S THE ODDS?
OR, THE DUMB JOCKEY OF JEDDINGTON.
A HEW BPOBTING NOVEL BY
MAJOR JAWLEY SHARP,
Author of " Two Kicks," " Squeezing Lanyford," §c., fc.
CHAPTER IV.—"Conspirators."

HE glittering eyes which, peering
through the stone •wall, had
startled the two Ladies, belonged
to LAWYER FERRET. His eyes
were as sharp as he was himself;
in fact, they were his pupils.
"I can see through a stone wall
as well as most people," said
LAWYER FERRET, in an under-
tone, to the HONBLE. PULLMAN.
"Come," he added, looking care-
fully about, "the women have
gone up to Town; the coast is
clear. We will ,talk over this in
my office."
In another hour the HONBLI.
PULLMAN was seated in LAWTEH
1 FERRET'S sanctum.
"The Jeddington Dodd pro-
perty is safe to come to me, and
we shall both be millionnaires, if you can insure SIB THOMAS'S winning the neit three
Derbys," said the HONBLE. PULLMAN.
LAWYER FERRET looked up at him from under his eyebrows.
"It shall be done. I '11 take six-fourths. You '11 have five-thirds." He was
hard at a bargain was old LAWYER FERRET.
"Good! Your plan?"
LAWYER FEBRET considered a moment, then he replied,—
"I know all the Jockeys, including CAVASSON the Dumb Jockey. I will buy them
all. There will be one hundred and twenty starters for the Derby. They will all curb
up their horses, hold them well in, and flog and spur the Invisible Prince, so that
he must go. Whatever it costs, whatever time it takes, the Invisible Prince will be
bound to come in first, as the others won't move a step without his being well ahead.
If CAVASSON should fail us, he must be poisoned."
"Yes," answered the HONBLE. PULLMAN, as he leisurely cocked his hat.
This action did not pass unobserved by LAWYER FERRET. It was not the first time
he had sctn a hat cocked right before his eyes, and had waited for it to go off, un-
flinchingly.
Whatever might have been the HONBLE. PULLMAN'S original intention in cocking
his hat, he had evidently given up any notion of injury to LAWYER FERRET, as he
only nodded to the latter, and .allowed his hat to remain on his head, while he took
himself oft.
A brougham pulled up outside the door. In it was LADY Dr.
"PUXLMAN!" she exclaimed, as the HONBLE. P. came up smiling, "here are one
thousand pounds for you. More if SIR THOMAS does not marry GUSSY."
"He shall not," answered the HONBLE. P. "Come to the Meet to-morrow. GUSIT
rides a fresh horie. Accidents will happen. You understand?"
"Perfectly. Tell the Coachman to drive to GTJNTER'S. It is BO insufferably hot.
See you at the Opera to-night. Ta, ta!" And off dashed the spanking ten-guin«a
stepper, with the miniature brougham, and the three Flunkeys in pink silk-stockings
and gorgeous liveries, hanging on for dear life
behind.
As the HONBLE. PULLMAN pocketed the note, a
rap on the hat from an elegant riding-whip caused
him to look up.
"I thought I knew the tap," exclaimed the
HONBLE. PULLMAN as he put up his glass, and
drank in the liquid intoxication of MRS. ASGOOD
AZAMYLE'S sparkling eyes.
"Your news?" she asked, as, with the skill of
a perfect equestrienne, she gave her horse his
head, which was all he wanted to make him per-
fect. Like most Ladies, MBS. AZAMYLE allowed
all her horses to eat their heads off in the stable,
so that it required no mean veterinary knowledge
on her part to supply the defect, and complete
their symmetry. This she had now done.
"Ah, MRS. AZAMYLE," said the HONBLE. PULL-
MAN. '' you will be glad to hear that I am arranging
it alt to your satisfaction. GUSSY will be thrown
over to-morrow, you 'II see. SIR THOMAS will win
three Derbys in succession, and the property will
be mine. Will you be mine also?"
"How much are the Jeddington Dodd estates
worth?" was MRS. AZAMYLE'S adroit reply. She
was a master in the art of fence in conversation.
"Oh, about two hundred million a year," was
the careless rejoinder. "Just enough to scrape
along on."
I 'm there !" returned MRS. AZAMYLE.
"You will be out hunting to-morrow, of course,"
called put the HONBLE. PULLMAN, as the fair
equestrian turned her horse, in the direction of
Rotten Row, which was as usual crowded with
the haut ton of society.
"Of course," she replied; and then added, in a
tone of significant inquiry, "How about the
Ditch?"
The HONBLE. PULLMAN nodded. They under-
stood one another.*
CHAPTER V.—" The Hunt is up."
THE Spring had passed, the Summer had well
set in. Bright Chanticleer proclaimed the morn,
and SIR THOMAS was out with his hounds before
11 A.M.
CAVASSON, the Dumb'Jockey, was mounted on
Invisible Prince.
"Nothing like hunting to train for the Derby,"
was MR. STRLNGHALT'S opinion.
Bra THOMAS was in high spirits. He had just
put spurs to his horse, t which now strutted about
as proud as a fighting cock. GUSSY GANDER was
mounted on a sweet cream, which she whipped
occasionally.
* Tlie Editor to Major Jawlty Sharp.—Hy dear Sir,
surely there's no hunting in Summer. For of course this
is intended for Summer. The Opera season going on, and
Ladies oppressed by the heat going from Eotten Row to
GUNTEB'B. We, speaking Editorially, never heard of
hunting in Summer.—ED.
Jawley Sharp to the Editor.—What! no hunting in
Summer!! I suppose you '11 say there's no fishing next.
I do not pretenu to describe ordinary events, though
there 'a nothing very «^raordinary in a good run with a
July Fox. Evidently you don't understand sporting.
But come down here, and I'll put you up to a thing or
two. Of course I '11 put you up anyhow, and not anyhow,
but in first-rate style. Now let me explain about a
"July Fox." A "July Fox" is not to be found in every
county. It is a Fox not of the present, but of the pre-
vious year, and should more correctly be described as a
"lust year's Fox." He won't keep till the following
winter, and so they are obliged to hunt him in July, so
as to get him out of the way before the Cub season seta
in. Of course this is a mere matter of A. B. C. to any
sportsman. And as to " no hunting in July "!! 'Gad,
Sir, I should like to see the man who doesn't prefer that
season of the year to any other. My dear friend, you know
your business, I know mine. Jam satis.—J. 8.

According to agreement, and in order to carry out their nefarious
designs, the HONOURABLE PULLMAW and LAWYER FERRET hav
escorted LADY Di and MBS. AZAMYLE to a ditch, in which they al
sat down, well hidden from view, in order to watch the horse, th
man, and the woman in whom they had such a tremendous interest
'I have arranged everything,^ said SIB THOMAS to GUSSY,

as she cleared a haw-haw, preparatory to giving a light silvery
laugh.

"And Moka t" asked GUSSY.
"Getting on fine. She's out on the sands, with the boys, from
morning to night at sixpence an hour."
They drew near a sunk fence, with a ditch on either side, BUT
mounted by spikes, and a stream running swiftly between the
boundaries.
The Lawyer, the HONOUBABLE PULLHAIT, and the two Ladies
secreted in the ditch, held their breath. Suddenly, as GUSSY'S horsi

iell heavily against SIB THOMAS'S hunter, and in another moment
both were in the river, and she was safe in his arms, safe as the bank
where he had just deposited his treasure.
"I am thine for ever! " she murmured.
The hounds were in full cry. The unhappy and panting Bagman
much worried by the dogs, had headed them, and crossing the corn-
helds, was now all among the barley, and rolling in the grass among
the buttercups and daisies.
Cries of " Tally ho!" "Yeo ho!" "Heave ahead!" "Yoicks!
and Half a turn a-starn!" now arose from the mouths of the
Huntsmen. Poor Puss was hard pressed. In another second the
do£s were on him, when they suddenly lost the scent, took up an old
trail, got on the slot, and streamed away for another county. In
vain the field halloo'd. Only old Harbinger, the veteran hound ot
the true Scotch breed, was true to his instincts, but he was too weak
to tackle the infuriated Bagman, who would have made short work
ot him, had it not been that SIB THOMAS, seeing the unfortunate
wretch about to rush at poor GUSSY, jumped off his horse, and.
drawing the hunting-knife which hung at his belt, cut off his head
and tail at one slice.
Then the Hunters struck up a chorus, and rode merrily home,
while four stout retainers bore on a litter the body of the luckless
Bagman, who would never more travel that road again.
Of course the poor Bagman, who had thus hardly earned the money
for his starving family, was buried, at SIR THOMAS'S expense, in the

spoke of hunting in summer, I naturally thought you meant Fox-hunting
and your letter corroborated this notion. But now, Sir, I find you mean Man-
hunting. It is useless for you to deny this, as I have asked several eminent
portsmen, and one and all tell me that'' to hunt a Bagman" is most unusual,
hough, perhaps, when a Fox cannot be obtained (as e.g. in summer, I suppose),
.t may occasionally be allowable. I gather, from information I have received,
that some impecunious Commercial Traveller is selected for his knowledge of
the country, and is then started with a red herring, or a bag of aniseed, which
serves as scent for the hounds. This is a sufficiently cruel pastime by itself,
and it is shameful to think that the poor Bagman, after a severe ran, should
be caught and worried, as you describe, by the dog«. But, good heavens, Sir,
rou are not in earnest, you cannot be, when you go on to say that the success-
ful huntsman cuts off the unhappy Bagman's head and tail!!! Of course
Ihis is the spice you have given to the romance, and therefore, as we appeal to
the general puohe, and reckon on the support of Lady readers, as well as un-
tportmy Gentlemen, I have taken upon myself to throw in a little tender
»uch—in the way of epithets, and by an allusion to his funeral and his poor
family—just to soften down this "Bagman hunting," which, otherwise,
would be really worse than any Bulgarian atrocity.—Tours, ED.

NURSEMAIDS BEWARE!

PRAY Mr. Punch, direct the atten-
tion of Servant-girls, through
calling that of their employers,
to the following piece of good
news :—
"At Hammersmith Police-Court,
MR. HENRY BUNKER, of Clapham,
was summoned by the Police for
driving a Bicycle on the footpath in
Ladbroke Grove Road, Netting Hill.
The Defendant pleaded Guilty to
wheeling the Bicycle on the foot-
path, but not to riding upon it. The
road, he said, was bad, and he thought
there was no harm in wheeling the
Machine on the footpath. MR. PA GET
said it was against the Law to wheel
a Bicycle on a path which was for
the use of foot-passengers. Bicycles,
it was true, had been invented since
the passing of the Police Act, but
the Act was elastic enough to take
them in. The Defendant must pay - - . He
for his experience of the Law.
fined him Five Shillings, with Two
Shillings Costs, and recommended
him to tell his Bicycling friends that riding on the footpaths was against the
Law."
If it is against the Law to wheel a Bicycle on a path which is for
the use of foot-passengers, it must be. at least, equally against the
Law to wheel a Perambulator. Does Materfamilias want this Law
to be enforced? If not, she had better direct her Nursemaid to
take care how, with eyes fixed on vacancy, she pushes a Carriage con-
taining, perhaps, a couple of heavy Infants, along the pavement, and
over the toes or a Philosopher, rapt in meditation, whom she does
not see in her way. Perhaps he has Gout in his toes, and, in that
case, when they are flattened by a heedless fool, that alteration of
their form is particularly unpleasant for
SQUARETOES.
OUR CHRISTMAS ROSE.
"ROSES AT CHRISTMAS.—A correspondent at Llandudno sends us a few
roses and hawthorn sprays gathered in December bloom, at that favourite
Welsh resort, where indeed roses are often known to nourish in the open air
all the year round."—Daily Tekl/raph.
HAPPY Llandudno! where, whilst Winter's pall
Droops o'er the town, and dims Mirth's struggling ember,
The Queen of June flaunts her bright coronal ,
In drear December!
Roses in Fogdom I Flora from her bower
Of deathless summer well might gaze with pity,
To see, midst dark and damp, her favourite flower
In our dull city.
And yet our Rosa Mundi, fragrant, fair,
With careful culture maybe brought to blooming
In Babylon's heart, whilst Winter, Want, and Care
Are round us glooming.
Think of it, Gentles, while you gaily twine
Your Christmas wreaths of mistletoe and holly;
To miss the flower of flowers, of birth divine,
Were worse than folly.
Think of it, Ladies of the Liberal hand,
Ere round your Yuletide log you oheerly close,
Let Charity in City wastes expand
Her Christmas Rose!

MR. PUNCH'S CHRISTMAS NUMBER FOR 1876.
(In the festive style which seems appropriate to the season.)
CHAPTER I.—The Infant Ghost!
AGAIN the weird creature crept through the long lone walk of
ihastley Grange!
LADY LAURA and her companion started from the tree (behind
which they had been hiding in very terror), and pointed at the
spectre as, slowly and surely, it crept along. It was a moment full
)f horror for both. ALBERT had been pleading his suit with all the
mpassioned eloquence of a young barrister fresh from the Old
Bailey, and she nad been listening to him. And now they were
nterrupted. Here, alone in the moonlight, they thought themselves
safe from intrusion, and they were wrong. A creature as unsub-
stantial as the air, as awful as the Unknown, was creeping, crawling
through the long, lone walk.
"What is it;•" asked ALBERT, for the fourth time.
LADY LAURA gave a great shudder, and clung to her companion's
shoulder with renewed energy. Then came a frightened whisper.
"It is the Bane of our Race. The villagers over yonder call it
he'Infant Ghost'!"
And then ALBERT noticed that the apparition was crawling on all-
burs.
"We both have seen it," murmured LADY LAURA, trembling with
error, "and now you must know all. It is I, the girl who loves
rou, the woman who would go through fire and water to save you a
noment's pain, who must tell you this—a story that will rob you of
all your joy, turn you from the gayest of the gay into the grayest
f the grave: a story that will steal from you your peace of mind,
and make you prematurely old."
"What is this story?" he asked, impatiently.
"The story of the Infant Ghost. You must know, then, that"
nd here she paused. She pressed her hand to her heart, gave a
leavy sigh, and died.
CHAPTER II.—The Fatal Telegram!
CHHISTIIAS EVE! A grand old castle, ruby with red berries, and
overed with mistletoe. The armoured figures reflected back the
lare of the Yule-lo^s as they burned brightly in half a score of
wainscoted rooms. Everybody was smiling. Even the old portraits
f the family of Frrz-BBOWNsmTH seemed to laugh fitfully as the
Irelight illumined them,
The Earl was holding high revel in the Hall. Scores of guests sat
t the festive board, toying,with the dessert, and drinking bumpers
o every newly-proposed toast. Only one of all that gallant corn-
any was pale, only one had eyes starting out of his head, only one
ad hair rising from the roots in abject terror. That one was
ALBERT DE PEUTONVILLE, or, as he must now be called, "the Lost
^ne." The death of LADY LAURA had greatly annoyed him.
The Earl was on his feet. He looked proudly at a picture behind
im, representing a Patriarch leaving an Ark. It was the portrait
f the Founder of the Family of FiTZ-Baowji SMITH.
"Ladies and Gentlemen, cried the jovial Earl, and his cheery
oice rang merrily through the vaulted halls, "I have one more
oast to propo«e—one that will, make you leap to your feet and
leer with all your might. Need I say that I propose the health
But the sentence was never finished. At this moment a telegram
as thrust into the Earl's hands. To tear it open, read it, and turn
) white as a theet was the work of a moment. The enraged noble-
man threw the paper into the fire, and, trembling with passion,
sproached ALBERT.
"Scoundrel 1 " he cried, and then turned to the Armoury.
But before the infuriated Earl could seize a battle-axe, ALBERT
ad quitted the apartment.
CHIPMB III.—The Secret Treasure of Heidelberg Castle.
"WE ihall be Princes after thi» night's adventure," said CABL to
ALBERT, as they climbed up the hill towards the Castle; "we were

obliged to come by night. In the day time the Guardians of the
Ruin would have stopped us."
"What is this Treasure?" asked ALBEBT, with some curiosity.
"You shall know when we are back once more in my house
beyond the river," replied his companion. "Enough to say, that
for this Treasure Louis THE FOURTEENTH would have given up his
Throne, CROMWELL his Protectorship, NAPOLEON THE GBEAT his
Victories. Once possessors of it, and we can laugh the world to
scorn. We shall be richer than ROTHSCHILD, and more powerful
than BISMARCK. And now we have arrived."
They were standing in the court-yard of Heidelberg Castle.
ALBERT held a dark lantern, and (.'A in, carried a spade. The latter
produced a small map, and then approached a stone wall. He
tapped thrice, and then a secret door opened before them, revealing
a flight of steps. They descended, and found themselves in an old
oak chamber, which had evidently not been entered for two hundred
years. The ancient furniture was covered with cobwebs, and rats
played about the floor. In front of the rusty fire-place was a mag-
nificent rug, moth-eaten and threadbare. GAEL removed this rug,
and then began to dig. In five minutes his spade turned up a small
gold hoi, covered with mystic figures.
"I was not deceived!" cried CARL. "And now we are Kings of
the World—nay, more, our empire extends to the Moon and Stars!"
"What is the Secret?" again asked ALBEBT.
"You shall know when we have returned to my cottage beyond
the river," was the frank but determined response.
And they retraced their steps. As they crossed the bridge, the
small gold box slipped from the hands of CARL, and fell with a
heavy splash into the water.
CARL threw up his arms in despair, and jumped in.
ALBEBT waitea for more than three-quarters of an hour, but his
companion never returned!
CHAPTER IV.—A Voice from Scotland Yard.
CHBISTXAS-EVE in Australia—in the Bush. A white-haired Man
was entertaining a short, sharp, little fellow he had found wounded
near unto death by the wayside. The wounded Man was now
convalescent, and both he and his rescuer were eating plum-
pudding.
"And so you are a Detective?" repeated the white-haired Man.
"And can tell you everything, ALBERT DE PENTONVILLE."
"You know my name?"
"And everything about you," replied the Detective, with a
stealthy smile.
"I know that you are living here unnoticed and alone under the
assumed name of the DUKE OF SUFFOLK AND NORFOLK. I know
that you have'chosen this aliat to escape attention."
"And do you also know," asked ALBEBT, "that I have chosen
this solitary fate because there are three Secrets I cannot solve?"
"Certainly," returned the Detective. "You mean the Story of
the Infant Ghost, the Contents of the Fatal Telegram, and the
Character of the Secret Treasure of Heidelberg Castle."
"And you know them F"
"All," replied the Detective. "And I have come this weary
journey from England to Australia to you, ALBERT DE PENTONVILLE,
to reveal these Secrets—these Secrets so startling in their novelty.
Listen while I give you the fullest particulars upon each of these
interesting subjects. You and I will be the only men in this wide
world who will ever know them."
And then the Detective began.

To play at Christianity.
That he—the worst of all the pack—

I do believe in shaken fists
As means of striking terror;
That amateur diplomatists
Must always be in error;
That the true patriotic plan,

CHRISTMAS "CASES."
THE melancholy case of MR. FRANK FLOWERDALE, who has
hitherto contentedly dined with his maiden aunts at their residence
in a little village in Epping Forest on .Christmas Day; but is this
year chafing and growling at being obliged from interested motives
to accept their inopportune invitation, depriving him, as it will, of
the bliss of joining the SUMMERTHORNS' family party in Rosebery
Street, sitting next to MINNIE SUMMBRTHOBN at dinner, and dancing
with her for the best part of the evening.
The miserable case of rich old EIDDLESWORTH, who is a misan-
thrope and a misogynist, and will dine as usual at the "Welsh
Rabbit" in Fleet Street, on the 25th, and afterwards return to spend
the evening alone in his dingy chambers.
The perplexing case of the REV. C. BABEY TONE, the popular
curate of St. Osnaburgh's. who has received four invitations to
dinner on Christmas Day, all from influential members of the con-
gregation with; most delightful families, the female members of
which are witching in appearance, fascinating in manners, and
highly cultivated in their musical tastes.
The touching case of poor little PINTHBOP, from Jamaica, who is at
school at the REV. FINBOROUOH DtrsiPHiCK's at Hackney, and has to
remain there for the Christmas vacation.
The worrying case of MRS. WHISSENDOTE, who with a particular
and fidgety husband, eight children all at home for the holidays,
friends staying in the house, and a large family party expected on
Christmas Day, is looking forward to the departure of her cook
and housemaid on the 21st, and has not yet succeeded in finding com-
petent successors.
The happy case of CHRISTINA CLOVERBOB, aged four, whose birth-
day falls on Christmas Day, and who has tallied and thought, and
dreamt of nothing else for the last month or six weeks.
MINISTERIAL MEDICINE.
AMONG those things which no fellow can be expected to under-
stand may be classed the following newspaper announcement:—
"THE EPILEPTIC HOMICIDE.—Mn. SECRETARY CROSS, having carefully
considered the case of WILLIAM DRANT, has felt justified, under all the cir-
cumstances, in advising HER MAJESTY to commute the convict's sentence to
penal servitude for life."
What, then, is Epileptic Homicide manslaughter? Does the Law
—Home Office Law—call Epilepsy an extenuating circumstance of
Murder? Epilepsy, Doctors tell us, is a convulsive disorder
whereof the subject s movements are involuntary, and wherein some
sufferers do not know what they are about. Either way, if homicide
is done in an epileptic fit is it not homicide by misadventure, or at
any rate throu gj i absolute if temporary insanity? One can under-
stand why an Epileptic Homicide should be taken care of during
HEE MAJESTY'S pleasure, but not why he is punished with penal
servitude P It is not MR. CROSS'S Law, probably, that is at fault in
this matter; but the line he took as to Vivisection, and his dealing
with Epilepsy, taken together, appear to indicate rather hazy views
of Medicine.

DIRECTIONS FOR THE SHORTEST DAT.
IirTthe morning put on a short coat.
Take a short walk before breakfast.
After breakfast go and have your hair cut short.
To celebrate the day becomingly, invite a party to dinner, con-
sisting exclusively of persons who are short-necked, short-sighted,
short-tongued, short-winded, and short in bodily stature. But do
not give your guests short commons, and instruct the cook to be
mindful that her pastry is short.
If you are called upon for a speech, let it be short and sweet.
After dinner have a short nap.
At tea-time place short-bread on the table.
In the evening play short whist.
The acquisition of fresh knowledge is always desirable—begin,
therefore, on this day to learn short-hand, or to study short-horns,
or to acquire greater facility in the composition of verses, longs and
shorts, or if you are afflicted with a short memory to employ arti-
ficial means to improve it.
Select this anniversary for baby to be short-coated.
Order in a stock of candles, short sixes.
Avoid short cuts.
Beware of taking something short.
Let your resentments be short-lived.
Do not give short weight or short answers; and, if you arn short
of money, do not suffer the deficiency to cause you to be short-
tempered.
At the close of the day indulge yourself with a short pipe.

Though they may be more dear.
Christmas is Turkey time, we know,
In bulletins, on boards,
And now insidious Russia shows
Her Cosaques' daring hordes.
Be't SMITH'S or CABMAN'S wit that
arms
These bright-clad troops of fun,
With toys and trinkets, games, cos-
tumes,
Pictures, and noise in one!
And then what books for hoys and girls,
The groaning Press supplies!
What happy and unhappy thoughts
For catching cash and eyes!
Enough! Forbear! Hold hard! In
vain,
The gifts rain, pelt, and pour;
Like poor Tarpeia I am swamped
In the too liberal shower!
"Give not to him that has too much—"
A happy thought! I cry—
"Turn the full flowing stream on those
Whose Christmas-tanks are dry!"
SINGULAR RAILWAY ACCIDENT.
(Specially reported by our own Penny-a-Liner.)
AN accident of rather an unusual character occurred at Euston Station on
Monday morning last, on the instant of departure of the nine o'clock express.
The train was actually in motion, and, indeed, had well-nigh left the platform,
when suddenly thu signal-cord was violently pulled, and a hare head was seen
protruded from a first-class carriage window, whence, hy several of the
bystanders, loud screams were heard proceeding, such as seemed to be the
shrieks of anguish or despair. On the stoppage of the
train, the cause of the disturbance was speedily ex-
plained. It appeared that an old gentleman, who was
travelling to Scotland with his wife and his two daugh-
ters, in order to spend Christmas, very wisely, away
from his own home, had, by accident, omitted to pur-
chase Punch's Almanack to amuse them on the journey.
In the excitement which attended the discovery of his
neglect, the worthy traveller proceeded to signal the
disaster, forgetting that he easily could make the
wished-for purchase at any of the bookstalls at which
the train would stop.
A REMONSTRANCE.
MB. PUNCH,
OR, why should I rcall you anythink hut what
I've been accustomed to, which it is old Punch, don't
go a suppoging that SAIEEY GAMP aint felt your ow-
dacious attacks, which they are shameful. To chaff a
poor old woman who 'as seen better days, and as 'ad to
(rive up nussin for to start a paper through misfortin!
Not that I aint better off than another party, a friend of
mine, who set up a paper, which shall be nameless,
although some said it was the 'Erald, which she killed
it, and which it killed 'er.
No, old Punch, I wouldn't demean myself by addres-
sing you as I have known werry intimate parties, quite
carriage company, with bran new titles, wno now seem
dispoged to show the cold shoulder to a poor old woman
who never 'armed a'air of their 'eads. Bother them, or
rather him, meaning LOED BEACONSFIELD, who now
won't have a word to say to his own SAIRET. No, Mr.
Punch, I wouldn't have demeaned myself by addressing
you, adn't you accuged me of being a Poet, like some low
lot, such as TENNYSON or SWINBURNE, or that there
SHAKSPEAKE. As MRS. HARRIS said to me the other
day, '' SAIKEY, you are the best of women. If I was asked
who is a angel m clogs and an umbereller, I'd say SAISEY
GAMP is that angel. SAIREY, you 'ave your faults (who
'asn't); but, SAIREY, you ain't a Poet: not your worse
enemy can say sich a spiteful thing!" And then I said,
"MRS. HARRIS, Mum, that old Punch has said it."
And then MRS. HAKKIS said, "SAIREY GAMP, you are
the best woman in the world; and that old Punch is
the worst man! Need I say more?"
Ugh! you bad, owdacious indiwidual, I only wish I 'd
the nussin of you! I 'd wake you up, then, you may be
sure, instead of sending you gently to sleep with my
paper, as I am accustomed for to do now, as it leaves
me at present. Saying such awful things of me, when
I am sure not one of my staff, from the real College Gent
who does my leaders down to the young chap who takes
down the shutters and writes the notusses on the Christ-
mas Books, would ever think of such a thing! Ugh!
you bad thing! I 'd bang you on the 'ead with my um-
bereller, if I wasn't a Lady!
It ain't the fust time you 've done it by many a
while. And at Christmas time, too,when there 's always
a bottle of somethink on the mantel-piece for parties
to put their lips to when so dispoged!
But I ain't rewengeful. As MRS. HABRIS said to me
only the other day, "SAIREY, I do believe as if any one
was to pull your 'ead off your shoulders, you would
smile quite pleasant. SAIKEY, your worse enemy can't
deny but what you are a saint!" I replied, '' MRS.
HARRIS, Marm, you 'ave known me these hve-and-forty
years; and so what you says must be true;" and so,
Punch, I forgives you: and if you likes to come to spend
New Year's Eve with me, vou will find the bottle in
the usual place. All I ask of you is not to say anythink
to me, nor to look at me, but only to let me put my lips
to it when I feels that way inclined.
And so, Punch, I wishes you a appy New Year, and
sends my respectful duty to your .good Lady, 'oping
that all the cherubs is well, as they leaves me at present.
Signing myself more in sorrer, than in anger,
Shoe Lane, E. C. YOUR OWN SAIKEY.

MEDITATIONS ON MYCEN/E.

Nor four years since,* some scholars, in their zeal,
Proposed the rifling of the Troad's mounds,
Where, within buried Ilium's doubtful bounds,
Great Hector lay by great Achilles' heel.
That heel, at which he whilom had been swept
Thrice round the weeping walls of windy Troy,
When white-haired Priam through the watch-fires crept,
To beg, with tears, the body of his boy.
Little the long-haired Greeks then dreamed that heel
Would for the fatal arrow find away,
That cut Achilles' thread with vengeful steel,
And stretched him beside Hector—clay by clay.
But stern BOB LOWE, guard of the public purse,
Flung scorn on HOMER'S topographic truth,
To Hector and Achilles showed no ruth,
Exploding both, as solar myths, or worse.
So they in their grave-mounds were left to sleep,
Unrifled and unverified, while BOB
• See Punch for April, 5, 1873.
Chuckled at savants who, the grave to rob,
Would rob the Exchequer it was his to keep.
Since that date simple SCHIJEMAN N'S venturous spade
Has brought Troy, layer by layer, to light of day;
And, if not Hector's and Achilles' clay,
Raised owls from eggs Athene never laid.
Thence kindled, German zeal now Hellas delves,
The Altis first, round great Olympia's fane,
Making PACSANLAS clear, and STRABO plain,
And with maimed statues filling Elian shelves.
Next SCHLIEMASW at his ghoulish work again,
All former Resurrection-men o'er-rides.
Rifling the tomb-banks where Mycenre hides
The treasure sought by Ancient Greece in vain.
For still it glimmered through traditions dim,
That called Mycenae ' rich' *, and her one vault.
Of massive stones that had braved Time's assault,
Christened the ' Treasury '—watched by Lions grim.

And so proclaim himself the King of Men.
If from that choice of shield to proof he goes,
From joy in fight.'clear voice, persuasive tongue,
Love of rule, old limbs with.young vigour strung,
And power alike to fell trees and floor foes,
Who, but with one voice, on Mycento's height,
Will hail him Agamemnon, high of hand.

And lead once more his Hellenes to the fight,
Hard by the Sccoan gate of windy Troy,
Where flows the Hellespont, the Moslem's still—

Who Homer's Greek doth more than Greeks enjoy!

A GElCUIXa BPOBIIBO HOTBL BY
MAJOR JAWLEY SHARP,
Author of " Squeezing Lanyford," " Two Kicks" $c.,
CHAPTER VI.—" The Treble Event."

LL the bright-toned joyous music of a hrilliant
morning heralded in the great day of the
Treble Event. Three Derbys in one day was
something almost unparalleled in the history
of the English Turf, and mighty was the
surging crowd that came from all quarters
to the Sussex Downs. Soldiers were there;
sailors, of course, were there, led by their gal-
lant Admiral, with his crew of fine old
weather-beaten Epsom Salts, who would not
have missed such a sight, no, not for the best,
highest-mettled Spanish Chestnut that ever
was foaled.
Hither came the million, hither came the
millionnaires. By road came the aristocratic
drags of the Roval Humane Society, starting
from their head-quarters by the Serpentine,
with their spanking tits; then by river came
the crews of the Universities, still in training
for their great water-course, and the winner
of the Grand Prix, in all the glory of his
new satin riband recently won on the French
Hither came Royalty with its sixteen horses, its equerries, its outriders, its carabineers,
and its detachment of Life Guards. Then the Russian Imperial Duchess, preceded by the Courier
of St. Petersburgh riding six horses at once, and guiding them with bright-coloured reins. Then
the world-famed Silver Trumpets were heard, as the LOBD MAYOR, with his suite, dashed past
the saluting point, gracefully raising his plumed cocked hat to the occupants of the Royal Box.
Close upon these the Starter* was carried past, ready equipped for the race, borne aloft, .'in
his loose box, by four bookmakers, followed by a well-trained troupe of Monkeys on Ponies,
emblematical of the Ring. Behind him waved the banner of the Turf, with the motto, "There
is another and a Betting world."
All eyes are, for a moment, fixed on the Starter. On him, in fact, the Derby entirely depends.
It is the fundamental and most necessary rule of the Jockey Club that " Without one Starter there
shall be no Derby." Consequently it is incumbent on the Turf authorities to provide a Starter, whose
duty it is to be booted and spurred, and in the saddle, ready to supply the place of any, or of all
defaulters. If none came to the post, the Starter would then start by himself, and walkover the
course. This has only happened twice in the last hundred and fifty years, once being the celebrated
Aeigh Buddie1* year. Up to the last moment of his being shown to the people, "the Starter"
is kept, by the official trainers, wrapped up in cotton wool, to guard against the slightest chance of
his being scratched before the race.

In front of the throne where
H.R.H. the PRINCE OF WALES was
seated, were stationed a picked
body-guard of splendid men from
his own Principality. All eyes are
on the celebrated corps of Royal
Welshers, with their banneret, on
which is proudly displayed the
motto, " Semper Faciens.
The Half-world, too, of whose
existence the other half knows so
much and yet so little, was present
in full force with flowers, sparkling
champagne, lobster-salad, and all
the fun of the fair. Here sat stately,
as of old, the old DUCHESS SARAH
of Stiickenbaskitt, calmly contem-
plating the throes of the excited
throng. From highest to lowest, all
are eager about the one business of
the day. The Gipsies, ready for
their al fresco dinner, have turned
away from their fire, and have put
the pot on the field, while within the
refreshment-tent, excited Waiters
are running for a plate, and the
Sporting Admiral has just managed
to place himself in time to come in
a good third for the cup.
Previous to the great event of the
day there were the usual number of
small races, over which a consider-
able amount of "stuff". changed
hands, though the public interest
was, of course, centred in the
Derbys.
First on the correct card was a flat
race for the Consolation Stakes. The
entries for this were entirely con-
fined to those who, through ignor-
ance of sporting matters, nad been
heavy losers through the week. A
purse had been made for them by
the Ladies. It is needless to say that
LAWYER FERBET and the HONBLE.
PiTLLMAlf were not among the com-
petitors.
One of the prettiest sights of the
day was the Maiden Race, run in
costume. The prize for this was
provided by the Bachelors of the
County; and nowhere, save in Great
Britain, could be seen so many fine,
fresh, sport-loving Damsels, in their
pink and white colours, as are
brought together on such an occa-
sion. Attractive as is the spectacle,
however, we must not linger near the
ropes, in order to bestow too much
ittention on it. Suffice it to record
here, that the Maiden Race was won
by Miss GUSST GANDAH, mounted on
a hot chestnut, to which she gave
a regular roasting with her jewel-
mounted whip.
'He's only a Plater,".said Gussr,
radiantly, as dismounting, she threw
herself into the arms of SIR THOMAS
DODD.
"True; but, 'Plater, thou rea-
sonest well,'" was SIR THOMAS'S
quiet reply. They had too serious
work before them to allow of any
spare time for the pleasantries of
society.
Three hundred horses—foals, colts,
nares, fillies—had been entered for
;he Great Race.
They were all there; not a screw
loose.
Moka is here, and the Invisible
Prince.
The Prince is not to run. He is
only here in case of any accident

dington, sparkling in the Tommy Dodd colours. LAWYER FERRET
and the HONBLE. PULLMAN, among the crowd, watch him closely.
They have given him two thousand pounds to win, but, feeling
uncertain of him, they have been poisoning him all night, and are
now waiting anxiously to see the effect.
LADY Di and Mas. ASGOOD AZAMYLE are also among the specta-
tors, in a barouche. GUSSY, who has overheard their schemes, has
told SIR THOMAS everything.
"What 'a the odds f " asked a neophyte. He is informed that the
bookmakers have backed Moka, at thousands to nothing, to win the
three Derbys in succession on this glorious day. Besides this, there
is no betting.
Everyone is " on," and STRINGHALT and WILLIAM BUTTON are
pale and nervous.
Breathless was the excitement for the Great Event.
The Sporting Admiral, who had been riding at anchor about the
course, and carrying a formidable whip, which he called his
"screw-propeller," now entered the weighing-room to see the
Jockeys get under weigh. CAVASSON, being late for the post, could
not be allowed to go without an extra penny. This was what the
Trainer wanted. Every ha'porth of overweight made the Dodd
victory more certain.
SMINGHALT grasped WILLIAM BUTTON'S arm. "Do you trust
CAVASSON?" he asked him, in a low, nervous whisper.
"I trust the animal—not the man," was the brief answer.
"What shall we do if we are floored P" asked the Trainer, in the
same tone.
"Why, 'carpet' CAVASSON," was the Stud Groom's stern
rejoinder.
But there was no time for further parley. The Bell was already
ringing, and the horses were settling down into their places.
'fMoka.'" "Invisible Prince.'" "CAVASSON! " were the names
on -every tongue. Anxious amateur bookmakers, who had been
watching the market, might now be heard offering ponies in hoarse
whispers.
Once more the Silver Trumpets sound, as the Judge, in his well-
known Derby horse-hair wig, well powdered and curled, and
wearing his scarlet and ermine, bows to the Royal box, and then
takes his seat in banco. Below him sits the Clerk of the Course, in
ordinary barrister's costume, with the Correct Card before him,
ready to call out the names and colours of the riders in proper
order.
SIR THOMAS has taken the odds all round.
CAVASSON. who only speaks on his fingers, is now beginning to
take the odds freely.
This caused a temporary panic among the bookmakers. But on
STRINGHALT and WILLIAM BUTTON backing Moka to win, the feeling
of security returned, and the betting went on again merrily.
LAWYER FERRET and his Fidus Achates the HONBLE. PULL-
MAN have issued secret orders to all the jockeys—simply these:
"When the word to start is given, hold hard. Squeeze Invisible
Prince. Wait on Moka, and if CAVASSON does not use whip or spur,
then let everyone belabour his animal, and urge him forward. Let
the crotcd press on him: he must go. If ail the rest persistently
stay behind, and shove Moka on, Moka MUST win, even though the
race takes three or four hours."
SIR THOMAS felt that the Jeddington Dodd estates were in the
hands of CAVASSON. His fortune and his wife were the stakes he
was playing for on this his Bridle day.
The Judge has arisen, and silence has been proclaimed by the
Ushers. For an instant thousands might have been heard to drop
all over the course. CAVASSON'S heart palpitates violently, and so
great is his excitement, that his colours come and go.
SIR THOMAS DODD grips GUSSY'B hand, while WILLIAM BUTTON
and STRINGHALT keep their eyes fixed on the Dumb Jockey, who,
for all his agitation, sits, apparently to the crowd, an immovable,
impassible, wooden figure.
The Starter calls over the names, as his assessors, the Two Pro-
bable Starters, note them down in their books.
All are present.
There is only one duty for the Police to perform before the start.
They have to see that everything is laid level all round, so that
there may be no obstruction to the running.
"One . . . . two .... three .... and"
A piercing scream interrupted the Starter I It proceeded from
CAVASSON, the Dumb Jockey, who, as if in a fit before the start,
suddenly threw up his arms in the air, and reeled heavily in the
saddle.

Counted Stage-tin good money,

Meanwhile, fun grown tricksier,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVARI.
AFTER THE CHRISTMAS DINNER.
EPOHTED BY OUR OWN LITTLE
BIRD.
Wn A T Paterfamilias
say*.—Well, it might have
been worse. Ton's wife
didn't quarrel more than
usual with JACK'S niece,
and UNCLE JONES seemed
to take some notice of the
children. I wish, though,
he hadn't abused the port.
However, BILL'S funny
story put him in a good
temper, and so I think his
will is all right for the
present.
1'flint Materfamilias
says.—I really must speak
to; Papa about FANNY and
her cousin HENRY. The
boy hasn't a halfpenny,
and it's most injudicious to
encourage hig visits. Dear
me! what an anxiety one's
daughters are to one!
i." What Fanny says.—Oh, wasn't it delightful? I know when he
sang " Is this a Dream t' he was thinking of me. If he does pro-
pose, what will Mamma say? I can answer for dear Papa; and
that's a comfort, at any rate!
What Uncle Jones says.—They are a great deal too civil to me,
and are waiting for my money. I hate children; and the port was
vile! Shall I leave it to BILL, or the Asylum for Idiots'( Better
give it to the latter, for then BILL will get the benefit of it 1 At
any rate, I will see iny lawyers at once.
What Jimmy says.—On my word, she seemed jollier than ever!
I must say I do like her—awfully. But then I should be so chaffed
at the Club! And I don't think she would like me to have a latch-
key! And then AUNT MARGARET would make such a bother about
it! On the whole, I can't do any harm by thinking over it—
another year.

know)
know,
He's quite a boy, you know—only fourteen. Fancy a child so much
younger than myself (I shall be sixteen in August!) presuming to
speak to me! It was quite ridiculous, wasn't it?
What Miss Wallflower toys.—Oh, we girls had such fun!
FANNY, LAURA, and I all lost forfeits. So absurd! Young MR.
RUBRIC, the Curate, had to bow to the wittiest, kneel to the pret-
tiest, and kiss the one he loved best. I was so relieved when he
didn't come near me. It quite reminded me of the happy Christmas
we spent when poor CAPTAIN ROSEBUSH went out to quell the Indian
Mutiny. And that must be nearly ten years ago f How quickly
time passes!
What Tommy says.—I don't care about your bread-and-butter
Misses! I only flirted with LAURA because 1 was afraid of speaking
to Miss WALLFLOWER! How beautiful she is! I would run away
from school if I could get her to elope with me.
What Mr. Rubric says.—Oh, a most pleasant party—on the
whole. I hope I am not ungrateful for feeling that I could have
been more at my ease if Miss WALLFLOWER had not sat next to me
at dinner. But the fact is, she really does send me so many
slippers. It is very awkward. I don't know what LUCY would say
if she heard of it.
What Dr. Dose says.—Certainly, my dear Madam. After
Christmas we must expect a little disarrangement. If you will
permit me, I will go to the nursery at once, to see the children.
What Misses Gerty and Emmie say.—Oh, don't let him come
near us, Nurse, and we will be so good!
What Masters Franky and Artie say.—We won't take the nasty
stuff! There!
What Mary Jane says.—It you don't take it before I count
three, I '11 go and fetch your Papa!
What Grandpapa says.—It was a very delightful evening, but I
wish those young romps hadn't persuaded me to dance Sir Roger de
Corerley. I am feeling it to-day.
What Grandmamma says.—The little ones enjoyed themselves
so much; and they are growing up so like their parents.
What the Cook says.—Well, it was an undertaking I But we
had a wcrry pleasant time of it afterwards. JOHH plays on the
banjo like a regular angel!
What Mr. Punch says.—And now, my good people, as you have
enjoyed your merry Christmas, I wish you all a Happy New Tear!
IN A GOOD CAUSE.
"[PuNCHprintsthe following suggestion, as he believes there are many
ot his readers who will be glad to embrace it. No doubt the Com-
mittee which is managing the benefit will receive subscriptions also.]
MY DEAR MR. EDITOR,
I WHITE this time not with a contribution, but with a view of
inducing contributions. I read this morning, with real sorrow, of the severe
illness of MR. COMPTON, and the urgency of some movement on his behalf.
Now, I shall certainly send my subscription in some form or other, but it has
occurred to me that there must be many, like myself, to whom a monster
benefit performance, shared by all the stars in London, presents no particular
attraction, and who would much rather give through some other channel.
Could not an ordinary subscription list be issued, quite apart from the pro-
posed Drury Lane performance, and advertised in the daily papers? I by no
means desire a stall or box for the benefit; but I do desire to offer my guinea
or two for the benefit of an actor who more than any other living comedian has
helped me, and thousands of others, to understand certain sides of Shakspearian
comedy, and who is, furthermore, one of the truest, most self-respecting, most
artUtic actors the Stage in our time has seen.
If this hint U likely to be of any service to the Committee, and to the cause
they plead, pray make any use of it you please; though I do not care that my
name should appear.

The wish he would wish you,
Would be, not in the old Army sense, " Sentry, Go!"

But there other force guards.

YES OR NO?
THE World asks the following question, which is echoed by the
Times of Dec. 13th :—
"YES OR No ?—Yes or no: is scarlet fever raging at a very well-known
and popular watering-place not a hundred miles from London? It is all very
well that the matter should be kept quiet in the interest of the tradesmen
and lodging-house keepers of the town; but such reticence may be pushed too
far, and do more harm than good^ as the evil will be inevitably exaggerated
when the prevalence of the epidemic becomes generally known. In the
meantime people talk about doctors visiting fifty and sixty patients a day, all
suffering from scarlet fever."
Mr. Punch, with his usual zeal for the public welfare, tele-
graphed to his Brighton correspondent, and received the following
reply:—" Scarlet fever raging during the early part of the season.
Parasols, cloaks, neckties, bonnets, fans, and chitelaine bags were
all scarlet. The epidemic is, I am glad to say, now much abated."
Worse than Bulgarian Atrocities.
DTJRTNQ the late visit of the PREMIER to LORD ALLINOTON at his
seat, Crichel House, the Wiltshire County Mirror announces that in
one day's sport the snooting party from the House (of gome six guns)
killed, besides other game, 1,109 peasants. We have heard a good
deal too much lately of the murder of Policemen by Poachers. It
would seem that Game preservers are beginning to retaliate. The
attention of MR. PETER TAYLOB, M.P., MR. ARCH, and the Agricul-
tural Labourers' Union should at once be called to the subject.
GHOSTS AND GULLS.
As an argument for the credibility of alleged spiritual manifesta-
tions, we are continually reminded ithat there are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy. Unluckily
the spirit a never tell us any of them.

Not for him to be smiling and bland,

Many thanks to that blessed Commission
For the foresight and thought they have shown,
In thus dating the next Competition
To suit our convenience alone.

And eat with most scrupulous care.

Of wild blunders and heart-breaking " sap,"
While examiners laugh in derision
As they see me fall into their trap.
All the pages I read daily daunt me
With mountains of volumes I 've not;
Through the long-lagging night-watches haunt me
Grim ghosts of the things I've forgot.
E'en in dreams I peruse legal fictions,
Review forms of attachment and sale,
Or ponder on Courts' jurisdictions.
And hold endless defendants to bail.
I decline things that know no declension;
I face armies of words short and long;
Yet. in spite of my earnest attention,
All somehow contrive to come wrong!

A GROWL AT GOOD WISHES.
(Symptomatic of Biliary Derangement from the Delicacies of the
Season.)
DECK out your dwellings with cypress nnd yew,
Toll out the Old Year and toll in the New.
Life is a tangle of troubles snd fears.
Wish you may get many Happy New Years!
"Happy New Year!" So you said on the last,
And who '11 say the twelvemonth has pleasantly passed?
When you are as old as I am now, my dears,
You '11 have most of you seen few or no happy years.
"^ Happy New Year!" How long new to remain?
New i ear is very soon Old Year again.
Always with more or less bother in store,
And as 'twixt "more or less," in most cases with more.
All our New Years unhappincss bring,
So will the present, 'twixt this and the Spring.
Accidents, crimes, and diseases, no doubt;
Bring me, most likely, a fit of the gout.
Needy relations an old fogy hears
Oft wish himself many Happy New Years,
When they suppose he has money to leave.
If they came into it, wouldn't they grieve!
Happy New Years, 'tis true, may await
Youths that inherit an ample estate,
Born with a big silver spoon in their jaws,
And idiots and fools who can laugh without cause.
But heirs, as a rule, are deficient in brains-
Spend all their money, and sell their domains,
Ruin their health by the ways they pursue,
So that their years are unhappy and few.
Christmas! I 'm glad "merry " Christmas is o'er,
Shall be still gladder when fools cease to pour
Impossibilities into my ears-
Wish me no more any Happy New Years!
WOEKING A SPELL.
THE present London School Board endorses the condemnation
passed by its predecessor on the present method of English spelling,
and prays for a Royal Commission to consider the best way to reform
and simplify it. For this purpose it has sent out circulars inviting
all the School Boards throughout the kingdom to join in a repre-
sentation to the Education Department and to Parliament. There is
room for reform in spelling when Dictionaries disagree, to the extent
so strikingly indicated a little while ago by the experiences of the
"Spelling Bee." But the Phonetic System goes too far, being a
scheme not of reform merely, but of revolution. There seems a
curious felicity in the idea of appointing a lloyal Commission to
determine our orthography. Royalty can command no special road
to learning, but nevertheless let us remember that the language
whose spelling the Government and the Legislature are solicited to
settle is the Queen's English.
Is the sort of thing below what we must make up our minds to
see introduced into the language of SHAKSPEABE and DRTDEN,
MACAULAT and SCOTT ?—

CHRISTMAS REFLECTIONS.

IF our parties were all of little HARRYS, little CHARLIES, and little
JACKS, we might like Christmas to come twice a year; but what
when these are largely dashed with little Bills P
"Under the Rose'Ms far more satisfactory to shy people than
under the mistletoe. The one tells its kisses; under the other you
may kiss and not tell.
Holly reminds me forcibly of my tradesmen's books. Its red
berries recall their covers; its leaves the sting of their contents.
When one listens to the good wishes lavished at Christmas, one
remembers this is the season for crackers.
Why will we give our children a false view of life from its very
threshold P You take your boy to the Pantomime at six. The
dream of his highest ambition is to be a Clown, and his highest
felicity to win and wed the Columbine!

SOME CHRISTMAS BOOKS.
NOT the Butcher's, the Baker's, the Grocer's books, and other
household books—oh dear no, but books for the household, or rather
the juniorest part of it.
What luck children are in for now-a-days! We hadn't such
books, and certainly we hadn't such pictures. Here's a charming
one for old and young, called Starlight Stories, by Miss FANNY
LAHLACHE, whose name sounds musical enough to begin with.
Commend us to this Lady's Jack with the Fishes and Why the Icebergs
come so far South. Then, next on the table is The Hunting of the
S/iark, by LEWIS CAKEOLL, who, as he never appears in print except
at this festive season, ought to be known as the Christmas CABBOLL.
The Snark is very distantly related to the Jabberwok, but it is not
the Jabberwok. Of all Christmas illustrations, those of Fairy Land,
by RICHARD DOYLE, are very easily first. Here is eltin fun and frolic,
here is a Midsummer Night's Dream at Christmas. Look at the
little Pucks racing on snails, irritating butterflies, fighting frogs, or
flirting with, tiny, coquettish fairies. MCMILLAN & Co. are to be
congratulated on " Carrots "—just a little Soy, which is a genuine
children's book: we 've seen 'em seize it, and read it greedily.
Children are first-rate critics, and thoroughly appreciate WALTER
CRANE'S illustrations, not only in Carrots, but in his chef-d'(cuvre
of the year, yclept The Baby's Opera, which is the cleverest,
prettiest, fancifullest, and, generally, superlativest Christmas book
that we ve seen for a very long time. The only mistake in it ia,
that, in some instances, the ancient land-marks of nursery readings
have been sacrificed to a sense of modern requirements. This, how-
ever, would be a subject for Shakspearian commentators; as must
be evident when we question the correctness of the version as here
given of the nursery song of "Mrs. Bond and the Ducks,"
Froggee would a-wooing, and others. Folios wouldn't exhaust
the subject. But to all those interested, antiquarianly, in the
Rhymes of the past, and to all those interested in the happiness
of the present rising generation, we say, advisedly, " Get WALTER
CRANE'S Baby's Opera."

LEIGH'S barouche
writing a last
letter to SIR
THOMAS DODD.
Oh, these last
letters'! these X,
Y. K's, of Love's
Alphabet!
Woe 's me; but
we all do it,
though sometimes
we rue it; but so
it will be till the
end of the world.
The wily Irish
LOROCHANCELLOB
THUBRAMOUGH
was right f or'once
when he said,
"These are letters
that ought to be written with a sheep pen on a calf s skin." No one
understood what he meant at the time, out experience has proved the
justice, as well as the wit, of the remark.
In a firm hand MBS. ASGOOD AZAMYLE traced the following
lines :—
GUSSY will not love you. She can't. She may laugh if you
tickle her under the chin, but it 's the same old game. I have stooped
to plot, because I love you so grandly, so madly. Humour saysyour
hands are to be tied at your marriage. If so, how will you put on
the ring? The ring, indeed .' Are you to give up the betting ring
for the wedding-ring? Bah! I've never blenched, and would not
now. I scorn sentiment. Let them all have a mate but me, what
matters, or rather what maters? After this observation, perhaps,
you will not care to see me. To-morrow I shall be all abroad.
Address me France. Pay 'your addresses, as the pottage comes
heavy. I shall be all there. Thine for ever, your
A. DORA.
P. S.— If PULLMAN CAKK can mar your Three Derby s he will.
LADY Di BRITELETOH was looking over her shoulder and copying
the letter word for word.
MRS. ASGOOD AZAMYLE, turning suddenly, caught her at it. This
turning suddenly had soured her. She was relentless.
One moment and the bright steel flashed in the air— another, and
it was in the inkstand, for LADY Di had screamed, and all eyes were
on the barouche.
MRS. ASGOOD AZAMYLE tossed the letter to SIR THOMAS, and then
was carried away by her feelings to a distant part of .the c»urse.
LADY Di, with a bottle of chloral in her hand, remained to witness
the result of the race, which her emotion has so suddenly and so
strongly interrupted.
In the meantime, unable 'to effect a satisfactory start, the horses
were going round and round a tall post, while a barrel-organ,!workec
by machinery, played various well-known airs. For this advan-
tageous exercise each jockey had paid a penny. The rich tones o:
the. old organ had a salutary and soothing effect on the men anc
horses.
LAWYER FEBBET and the Honb[e PULLMAN CARH stood by, eyeing
them narrowly as they passed in rotation. Had CAVASSON been bough
or not ?— that was the question. The crafty solicitor, and the equally
astute Hon1"1' had sent him bouquets, bills of the play, and olank
unsigned cheques to any amount, but could they be sure of him
This was rather an open way of buying a jockey, but it had answem
before; and was it to be questioned now '<
Once more the trumpets sounded, the bell rang, and the gong
sounded.
"They are oft'!" "He 's off!" "No, I 'm on!" "They 're al
off!' "No, all on!'
Ha!!! They 're away at last! I!
No! Not one of them stirred. Each jockey, true to his bargain
with LAWYER FERRET, reined in his horse, and remained at the
tarting-point. LAWYER FEBBET had squared the jockeys on all
joints, save one. This he was compelled to leave to their own
hoice. It was a critical moment; but all at once the Lawyer
xelaimed gleefully, "That was all that was wanted! They have
lone it! They have squared their elbows!" And so they had.
By order of the'.Starter the police were ordered to pull the horses,
"he Judge had .decided that a horse, if thus pulled, might fairly
win. If the other horses would not stir a peg, no more would
Moka. On the contrary, she backed in among the crowd, and was
Tadtially working her way to the last place in the field. It was
hus that her clever jockey CAVASSOS was hacking her to win.
The Bookmakers were frantic; they had laid their skins on
CAVASSON winning on Moka. Not a chance of her stirring at
iresent. There sat CAVASSON on Moka, calm, serene, impassible!
"Back her! Back her!" cries SIR THOMAS, excitedly. ""We
have backed her!" exclaimed the Bookmakers despairingly,
jeginning to think they had been let in for a regular snorter.
But CAVASSON has his game to play. He has not been idle for
months, and the horse has been under the hands of the most adept
if circus trainers.
At a signal from CAVASSON, Moka, paying no attention to
he lashes from the whips of the jockeys, who are belabouring her
leavily, rears on her hind legs, and paws the air, cleaving a wide
;pace around her.
"Two for her heels!" shouted STRINGHALT, who was in the
ecret. And immediately the clever cob reversed the action.
Jockeys and horses fell right and left of her, as CAVASSON waved
L flag, and fired a couple of pistols in the air; while WILLIAM
BUTTON, who was hidden behind the Starter's box, shook a sheet of
ron to represent thunder, and QUSSY, from her brougham, threw
squibs in among the troubled mass of horses.
Further attempts to hold them back were useless. Maddened by
he fireworks and the sheet iron, the horses broke away, and the
ockeys, losing all control, tumbled off, and were picked up by the
jolice. "Keep your seats, Gentlemen! keeplyqur seats!" shouted
,he infuriated Starter. Then he grumbled to himself, "I've never
seen such a start as this before!"
"Don't move on my account!" shrieked SIR THOMAS to CAVASSON.
The Dumb Jockey nodded to his employer, as Moka quietly backed
against the starting-post, while all the other horses tore madly
onward, in spite of the strenuous efforts of their jockeys—onward,
onward.in a whirlwind of dust, round Tottenham Road Corner, up
;he hill, down the hill, and through the Middle Park, amid the
execrations of the furious Bookmakers, who were on the Moka colt
;o their last shoestring.
The Boy in yellow won the day! Moka was last of all, still
waltzing on her hind legs, a few yards in advance of the starting-
Dost. SIR THOMAS clasped GUSSY round the waist in silent gratitude.
The first Derby had been lost! Thank Heaven for that!
From the Editor to MAJOR JAWLEY SHARP.—Dear Major, of course you

LINES ON LATE HOURS.
(A Carol by MB. KILLJOY.)
T home from night
till morning
every one who
will carouses,
But law paternal
limits open hours
for public-
houses,
Imposes upon Eng-
lishmen restraint
of wine and was-
sail,
The Landlord of
the Castle's
house is not that
landlord's castle.
All Sumptuary
Laws are things
to raise a Briton's
dander.
But, if what's con-
diment for goose
were condiment
for gander,
Soon would restriction in this pump-and-platform-ridden nation
Be also put, by statute, on domestic dissipation.
The New Year at its finish, and the Old Year at its start is
Attended with festivities entitled " evening parties,"
Where, in contempt of Reason's voice, and sanitary warning,
Green Youth and Beauty dance from ten at night till four next morning.
With coffee, tea, or lemonade but few of them thirst slaking;
Most of intoxicating drinks from time to time partaking—
Upon champagne and claret-cup, making what is called " merry,"
Not to say that " Specialite" which bears the name of " Sherry."
For six long hours too many a pair—unwise young man and maiden—
Breathe atmosphere with gas-fumes and carbonic acid laden,
Combustion's products from the jets which yield illumination,
As well as action of the skin, and human respiration.
They waltz in this foul atmosphere, nor think of what comes after,
Until, when supper-time arrives, with flirting, fun, and laughter,
They sit them down to eat and drink, and, heedless of health's question,
Rise, dance again, shake up their meals; whence bile and indigestion.
Meanwhile what tongue can tell what woes their hapless seniors suffer,
The wallflower matron overblown, and corpulent old " buffer,"
In charge of marriageable girls, the daughters or the nieces
They've brought to market; or, that o'er, how happy their release is!
The elderlies, at least, would hail a measure of repression,
To be, perhaps, brought in upon a Wednesday in next Session—
A " Balls and Evening Parties Bill," which, penalties imposing,
Shall upon private Hosts enforce the rule of Early Closing.
ARTICLES DE PARIS.
OUB neighbours, the Parisians, are wont to feel affronted if a suggestion is
thrown out that they can take nothing seriously.
What was known in old RABELAIS' time, and still is called the badaud 'de
Paris, exists in every class, nay, even dominates in the Assembly, as in the
streets, and among the newspaper readers. One cannot help being struck with
this in looking over the most popular journals now issued in the French capital.
At a moment when all eyes turn towards the East, whence the results of the
impending Conference may bring hope on the soft breath of Peace, or despair
through the brazen throat of War, the columns of French newspapers, which
only deserve the epithet of Serio-comic, teem with old calembourgs and
feeble jokes, more or less gross, and, in many cases, untranslateable to delicate
ears.
In some out-of-the-way corner of a page, or crushed between two long articles
on light social subjects, or two elaborate tirades of personal invective, may be
found a short paragraph, announcing some doubtful intelligence from Constan-
tinople, coupled with mythical details of our Special Ambassador's movements:
but of serious information to guide contemporary opinion, and furnish historical
evidence for future generations, not a syllable!
The chroniqueitrs can tell you what such an Actress wears even in her
dressing-room, or how such a public scandal in petticoats comports herself at
supper; but for weighty fact, and instructive comment on passing events, you
might as well look through the advertising columns of the Boulevard.
Take a number at hazard of Le Rasoir.
Where an Englishman would naturally turn to drink
in carefully weighed opinions on the leading topic of the
day, what do you find i—a sentimental article, taking up
four or five columns of the paper, on the charm of hang-
ing up stockings or shoes in the chimney, to be filled with
bonbons for the.children! Then a Gentleman, who per-
haps signs himself Chauve-Souris, or Clodoche, treats le
pitolique le plus spirituel du monde, with a batch of spicy
inecdotes, beginning with an indecent Malapropism of
MDLLE. X., and ending with a dirty story attributed to
BARON li... Between.these you may, perhaps, discover,
after some investigation, a few lines, headed La Poli-
tiqiie, commencing with a reference to MIDHAT PASHA,
and the Conference, and terminating in a series of notes,
evidently thought more likely to interest the readers of
the paper, concerning that dignitary's harem, and the
number and characteristics of the female slaves therein.
Then the inexperienced reader may commence what
he takes for an article, but turns out to be a flowery
advertisement of a new confiserie, or sweet-meat shop,
with Oriental descriptions of the sweets therein sold,
or of a depot for corsets, with elaborate variations on
the beauties of the Venus de' Medici and the charms
of the femme du monde.
We may be a "nation of shopkeepers," but we do not
allow silly or scabreux shop-puffs to monopolise the best
part of our leading journals.
Fancy, a number of the Times appearing with the
following Table of Contents " under the clock " :—
SUMMARY.
Leading Article.—The origin of Mistletoe; to which
is added an Analysis of Kissing.
Echoes of London.—Two extracts from Joe Miller,
three jokes from back numbers of Punch, and an
American after-dinner story, which REYNOLDS himself
might hesitate about publishing.
'Parliamentary Reports.—Personal remarks on Oppo-
sition Members, and intimate details of the family life
of a Prime Minister.
Letter from MB. RIMMEL in praise of his Perfumes.
From Windsor to Balmoral.—A short satire on the
Members of the Privy Council, made up of cracker
mottoes extracted from their public speeches.
Dramatic Notices. — Including a description of ME.
CHARLES MATHEWS'S little dog, an account of an ac-
cident to MRS. BANCROFT'S kitchen-chimney, and an
anecdote of a little supper at MB. TOOLE'S.
News of the Day.—How MB. JONES, the well-known
dentist, left his house this morning in the rain, and forgot
his umbrella, &c., &c., returning to obtain the desirable
property when the sun came out.
Or,—How last evening two policemen, usually on duty
at such and such a crossing, were taken off. This remiss-
ness on the part of the Superintendents at Scotland
Yard, caused a confusion which, &c., &c.
Really, there is much which is not "done better in
France; and, amusing as all this may be in a weekly
periodical, the daily Battle of life (in England, at least)
demands a more solid literary commissariat.
WAITS AND MEASURES.
WHAT a pity it is that London should be so far
behind Birmingham, where that energetic Chief of
Police, MAJOR BOND, not satisfied with insisting on all
sly drinkers "toeing the line," under pain of fine or
imprisonment, has commenced a crusade against the
Waits, in the following grimly ascetic
"CAUTION.—Numerous complaints are made of the dis-
orderly conduct of Youths who go around the suburbs of the town
during the nights of 24th and 31st December,' begging' under
the pretence of saying 'A Merry Christmas,' and ' A Happy New
Year.'
"All persons found so offending will be apprehended by the
Police, and charged with being disorderly characters.
"Police Office, "fi. BOND, Major, Chief of Police.
"19th December, 1876."
There! Birmingham is blessed with its own BOND.
London is free—worse luck!
Failing police protection against these Christmas noc-
turnal disturbers, might we not adopt the irate suggestion
of a misanthropic old Brute, who sends us the following
recipe:—" Keep in your bedroom a garden-engine, its
reservoir filled with ice-cold water, of which give any
Wait full measure."

Without t/aiir supcrlluous suggestion of horrors that fill one with

Snakes ?_ Eugh! Just imagine Society 'neath an Ophidian spell!
Our Ladies like willing Laocooas—crowned d la gortjon as well!
Their boas all boa constrictors, their trains with huge rattlesnakes
tipped!
Each waist by a cobra encompassed, each wrist by an asp closely

Just fancy the wife of your bosom a python as far as her face!
Your love like an undisguised Lamia seeking your shrinking

Oh, a vixen in guise of a viper were surely a Nemesis fit
For men who can make such a use of their ill-employed fancy and

"Why should Ladies not patronise Snakes?" ME. BCTCKLAND, you

for a joke.

Though Beauty has patronised beetles, methinks she might there

Xot a serpentine one—and eschew the Ophidian's sinister shine.
No! Woman is Anfjuis in herM, and ophiomorphous in soul.
But encourage Ophidian fashions in dresses? 0 FKAXK, you 're a

That snake of Old Nile was a type,—she who died of the aspic at

But she did not go clad in the sloughs that the serpents of Egypt

AN OLD CORRESPONDENT IN A NEW PLACE.
DEAB PUNCH,
WHEN the PRINCE OF WALES was in India, I read with
?reat interest the letters of your Special Correspondent, but towards
the close of the series the pleasure which they gave me was greatly
marred by the cruel suspicions which you cast on the good faith of
your talented Representative by hinting that he had never g^one to
India at all. but had written the letters at Gravesend, with the
assistance of a Hindoo crossing-sweeper!
I fear thatj in your injustice, you went so far as to dismiss him.
But true genius cannot long remain hidden; and my sorrow at your
harshness and your " Special's" misfortune was turned into joy on
reading in the Times of Christmas Day the account of the Vice-
regal procession at Delhi. No other hand but his could have penned
the following remarkable sentence:—
"Behind them came the remainder of the Body Guard and a squadron of
the 10th Hussars; thc-n tlio three Lieutenant-Governors, each on an elephant,
and each attended by his Staff; next the Members of Council, the Secretaries
to the Government, and the Chief Justices of Bengal and the North-Western
Provinces; thta Solah Topees, looking singularly out of place in their judicial
robes."
It is many years since a Member of the House of Commons spoke
of "the ferocious doolies who rushed on to the battle-fields, and
carried off the wounded;'' but his fame in India will now be shared,
if not eclipsed, by the Times Correspondent, who has made the
English public for the first time aware of the existence of those
exalted members of the legal profession in India known as " Solah
Topees." Deep must now be your regret at having, by your hasti-
ness, allowed another journal to shine with an immortal glory that
should have remained exclusively yours. gver yourg)
RAM SING.
P.S.—If your Boy has yet returned with the Dictionary which
you sent him for, would you look up the words "Solan" and
Topee "? In mine, which I have hitherto thought a good one,
they are translated as "pith" and "hat." But this must be a
mistake.—R. S.
LESSONS LEARNED AT A PANTOMIME.
(By an Intelligent Schoolboy.)
THAT Demons are much given to making bad puns, and have on
their visiting lists the most beautiful of the Fairies.
That the attendants upon the Demons (presumably their victims)
spend much of their time in break-downs.
That the chief amusement in Fairyland is to stand upon one toe for
a distressingly long time.
That the Fairies, when they speak, don't seem to have more H.'s
to^their tongues, than clothes to their backs.
That the Fairies have particularly fair complexions, considering
they dance so much in the sunlight.
That the tight and scanty costume of the Fairies is most insuffi-
cient protection from the showers that must be required to produce
the gigantic and highly-coloured fairy flora.
That the chief Fairy (to judge from her allusions to current
events) must take in the daily papers.
That Harlequin is always shaking his bat, but nothing seems to
come of it, and that it is hard to say why he comes on or goes off, or,
in short, what he's at altogether.
That if Clown and Pantaloon want to catch Columbine, it is hard to
see why they don't catch her.
That Pantaloon must have been greatly neglected by his children
to be exposed without some filial protection to such ill-usage from
Clown.
That Clown leads a reckless and abandoned life, between thefts,
butter-slides, hot pokers, nursemaids, and murdered babies, and on
the whole is lucky to escape hanging.
That Policemen are made to be chaffed, cuffed, chased, and knocked
head-over-heels.
WESIINGHOUSB TO THE BESCUE.
A HOPE in kind Punch's bosom awakes—
0 Companies, don't go to prove his hope rash is!—
That some day you'll give us " continuous brakes,"
Instead of, as now, continual smashes.

for Orders. Managers of theatres think differently.

WEALTH TOR THE SPIRIT-WOULD.
PROGRESSIVE MR. PUNCH,
At.a time when festivity coincides with dearth of incident,
DR. SCHLTEMANN'S discoveries of buried treasures at Myceme raise a
seasonable suggestion. Our minds just now naturally revert to the
question of sepulchral reform, whether to be accomplished by
"Cremation," or some other improvement on returning " Earth to
Earth." Were it not best in this matter to resume the manners and
customs of the ancients altogether, and after the usage of prehistoric
times, inter along with the relics of the departed, a selection of their
arms, accoutrements, conveniences, ornaments, effects, goods and
chattels? Those ancients intuitively believed that such things
would be useful to the deceased in the lower world. There are facts
which indicate, if not prove, the truth of their intention. It
is strongly attested by the phenomena of Modern Spiritualism. If
a Medium can at one and the same time be entranced behind a
curtain, and also appear before it us a materialised spirit-form,
there is no reason whatever why a ring or a breastplate, whilst
lying in a sarcophagus, should not nevertheless be simultaneously
worn in the spheres—the classic Hades, which our better acquaint-
ance with it, through communication with its inhabitants, has taught
us more cheerily to style the Summer Land. Happy land! yet there
is.too much reason to apprehend that we fail in contributing to its
happiness as much as we might by depositing in the tomb those
articles of pleasure or utility which we must suppose to be requisite
for the comfort and enjoyment of the spirit. It is the want of these ne-
cessaries in the spirit-world which constitutes an indigence described
truly by a phrase commonly applied to a mere scarcity of curates
and scripture-readers in a populous district. Deficiency of com-
modities needful for spirit-life is the only real " Spiritual Destitu-
tion."
Let us, then, imitate the faith and the generosity of an heroic
age. We are richer than ever the Mycenians were. They could not
afford such expensive interments as we can. Let our warriors
and Statesmen, then, be buried with sovereigns, and half-
sovereigns of gold. Bank-notes might be added, to the no small
advantage of Banks. Continue to sprinkle flowers on the bier by
all means; but likewise scatter small change. Bury with a General
Officer his sword and boots; with an Admiral his telescope; inter
with a Gentleman his watch, his walking-stick, cigar-case, and
box of Vesuvians. Forget not useful little things, such as an
old Gentleman's spectacles, or a young Lady's chignon and bando-
line. By the bodies of old friends and boon companions lay down
some bottles of wine; also a corkscrew, with a few glasses, and
pewter-pots. Should all these stores for spirit-use ever be exhumed
in after ages, they will, of course, excite the greatest interest; and,
being deposited in a Museum, serve to instruct Posterity, con-
tinuing in the meantime to supply the wants of the happy spirits
whose remains they were interred with.
Of course the proposal of sacrificing money or money's worth in
funeral arrangements for the advantage of spirits will be un-
mercifully ridiculed by utilitarian materialists; but, Mr. Punch,
would this sacrifice be nearly so ridiculous as the prevalent practice
of sacrificing property, burying upholstery, wood-work, and drapery
to no purpose at all, except that of enriching undertakers? This
question I am commanded to ask you by my controls, SHAKSPEARE,
SIR ISAAC NEWTON, GEORGE Fox, and MICHAEL FAEADAT, at whose
dictation I am writing, with both my eyes bandaged, and my hands
on a planchette under the table—if you will only believe your
humble Servant, and ever attentive constant Header,
A TRANCE MEDIUM.
P.S.—I enclose name and address, with terms for stances.
NOT WORTH POWDEE AND SHOT.—Si Slocum.
