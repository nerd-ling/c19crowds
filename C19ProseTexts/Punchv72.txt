July 7, 1877.] PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. iii
EHEMOTH or Bogey? Awful Apparition or Sorry Show 2 Colossus of Roads and Realms, Over-stepper of Deserts, Over-
strider of Mountains, Floorer and Framer of Faiths, Extinguisher of Nationalities, Absorber of Empires, Disposer
of Manifest Destinies, Defier of Magnificent Distances; or Immensest of Impostures, Darkest yet Dullest of Diplomatic
Deceptions, Shallowest of Shams, Biggest of Bubbles, most Barefaced of Bankrupts, Gelatinous of Giants, and Weak-kneed
of Warriors ? The most far-seeing and far-reaching Power that ever pursued a settled purpose of Universal Dominion
through centuries of shifting circumstances; or the most monstrous mushroom-growth of empire that ever struck root in
corruption, to swell to deceptive dimensions, and thence dwindle into swift decay ? Thou canst not be both. Art thou
either—or neither?
Has PUNCH, with Russia in Bulgaria and at Erzeroum, a right to sit smoking the cigar of composure on the
stone-wall of insular impassibility, or ought he to be doing penance in his own sheets for his mockery of more penetrating
piercers into the Millstones between which are ground out the Destinies of Nations in the mighty World-Mill?
Such was the question which, after much distracting study of London's many-minded newspaper organs—summer sun
and iced cups and nerve-soothing Nicotian aiding—PUNCH pondered under the shade of his own laurels.
Suddenly there seemed to stand by him a shadow—yet not a shadow, but a very solid substance—a Presence as of a
brother-Briton, but with a more settled purpose in his face, and a more searching sharpness in his eye, than belongs
to mere mortal. And the Presence stretched out its hand so that the shadow fell across Pusch's brow, and straight
it was as if he had passed suddenly from the fierce heat and ghastly glare of the Black Country of Political Polemics, all
lit up with blazing questions, into a cool region of sweet airs, and cooling waters, whereof it was revealed to him, he knew
not how, that the Presence was the Presiding Power.
“This is an age of Examinations,” said the Presence, “though as yet I have not admitted them into my
system, unless when, like MR. Cook's Tours, they can be ‘personally conducted,'—that is, put under the guidance and
correction of Common Sense, your humble Servant——”
“My ever loyally acknowledged, and to the best of my ability faithfully served, Master," cried Pusch, prostrating
himself.
“I rule,” replied the Presence, “as far as I yet do rule in England, in the person of my valued ward, QUEEN VIoTopLA.
We have just celebrated the Fortieth Anniversary of her reign. Let us drink her health and long life in a cup suiting alike
the time and the toast—cool as her head, clear as her understanding, strong as her sense, and bland as her temper. They
that are loyal to her, are loyal to me. But, methinks, I have rarely seen that loyalty put to greater strain than of late.”
“Your Majesty surprises me," observed PUNCH, respectfully. “The present claims to be eminently the age of Common
Sense.”
“Ritualism and Home-Rule, Spiritualism and Foreign-Loan-Financing, Continental Levies and Papal Infallibility,
China-Mania and Oxford AEsthetics, Brotherhood of the Holy Cross and Russophobia to the contrary notwithstanding?”

sardonically interposed Common Sense. “I began by saying we live in an age of Examinations. I propose to examine you.
What makes the Strength of Nations?" -
“National Health and National Wealth.”
“Enumerate the leading symptoms of National Health."
“Diffused Education, wide-spread Comfort, a well-balanced Political Constitution, Reverence for Home, Loyalty to
National Institutions, Sobriety, Respect for Truth and Fair Dealing between man and man.”
“Which of these do you find in Russia?”
“Not one. I find, instead, an almost utter want of Education; a thin varnish of Luxury, but no Comfort; a Despotic
Government; Communism in the villages, Affiliation to destructive Secret-Societies in the towns; Drunkenness and
Falsehood generally prevalent; Dishonesty in private dealings, and Corruption in public offices.”
“What are the chief conditions of National Wealth 2"
“Widely-diffused and intelligent Industry, and labouring Arms at command, with accumulated Capital and sound
Credit to set them to work; a fertile Soil; Commerce; Manufactures; abundant Raw Material; and Free Trade to turn all
these to the best account.” -
“Which of these do you find in Russia?”
“Not one. I find, instead, a poor, pining, and protected industry; labour scarce, ill-trained, unenergetic and largely
reduced by the constant drain for military service; little accumulated capital, heavy indebtedness and exhausted credit; a soil
barren over by far the larger part of its enormous extent, and where it is productive, with the trade in its raw material
exposed to an overpowering foreign competition before which it dwindles yearly; next to no healthy commerce or manu-
factures, and a rigidly protective system.”
“What makes a nation formidable to its neighbours?"
“Aggressive intentions, backed by effective force.”
“Do you find these united in the case of Russia?”
“No. Admitting the intentions, I fail to find the force that should be formidable to a really formidable opponent?”
“How, then, do you account for her conquests round the shores of the Black Sea, about the ridges of the Caucasus,
and in Central Asia beyond the Caspian to the borders of Afghanistan and the confines of Chinese Tartary 4”
“Because in these cases she was dealing with barbarians weaker than herself.”
“Do you not fear what Russia can do to endanger our rule in India?"
“No ; for I think our basis of defence about the strongest, her basis of attack about the weakest, in the world. If a
thousand miles of waterless deserts and impassable mountains, and more than that distance between even the border of
these and the sources from which all Russia's supplies must be drawn, and that by a nation whose European credit, as I am
assured by those who are loudest in their fear of her, is exhausted, and whose internal system is honeycombed by the secret
workings of discontent and disloyalty, be not sufficient defence of a power rooted as England is in India, with her communi-
cations secured by her command of the sea, her soldiers and sailors well trained, well officered, and animated by the high
courage of our race, and the wealth and credit of Great Britain's vast empire and world-wide commerce at their back, then
facts and fancies are one, and PUNCH has read History in vain.”
“And, worse still, has studied in my schools and worked in my service to no purpose 1" exclaimed Common Sense, as,
with a sudden explosion of impatience, he shut down with a snap the Russian Old Bogey into his Box, while Toby rested in
peace under the shadow of

ON NEWBURY FIELD.
[It is proposed by the Newbury District Field Club to raise a memorial of
Lucius CARY WIscount FALKLAND on the spot where he fell in arms for the
King's cause, in the first Battle of Newbury, Sept. 18, 1643. £600 is required
for the purpose... Nearly half the sum is already subscribed. Subscriptions
may be paid at the Old Bank, Newbury, and in }. at Messrs. DRUM-
Mon D's, RANson's, RoRARTs's, and the London and County Bank.]
THERE stands a pillar upon'Chalgrove. Field,
Where by war's blind event John HAMPIEN fell,
To die, still praying till his lips were sealed
That God would save the land he loved so well.
That stone reminds our times of peaceful ease
How HAMPDEN's stainless sword, drawn to defend
Old monarchy and ancient liberties
Of England, was borne stainless to the end.
We see the stern and steadfast face, still set
Peacewards through rising storms of civil life:
By a high purpose purified from fret
Of party feud and hate-embittered strife.
There was another, who to HAMPDEN's goal
Pressed on by other road than Hººn went ;
Whose yearning after peace so vexed his soul,
It robbed his night's rest and his day's content—
FAIKLAND, who, when men's hearts were tried with fire,
Came from the furnace pure as gold thrice-proved:
Who threat of Parliament and royal ire
Withstood, in strength of his high aim unmoved,
That he might teach a land that reverenced law
To brook the rule of law-abiding kings;
For this he stroye, while with hope's eye he saw
The waving of the White Peace-Angel's wings.
But when they closed in smirch of blood and smoke
On Edgehill field, he drew a burdened breath,
Went weary, as a man whose heart is broke,
And rode the fight like one who seeks for death.
At Newbury he found it, in the van
Of BYRON's charging troopers charging home.
Of the King's following the noblest man,
Who had crowned Law and Peace 'neath Freedom's dome.
No stone yet marks the spot where FALKLAND fell.
The time is come such record were supplied.
As Chalgrove pillar doth of HAMPDEN tell,
Let Newbury tell how FAIRLAND lived and died.
'Tis well that England lift a thankful heart
God hath so blessed our land, that either cause,
The King's and Parliament's, could find a part
For FALKLAND, HAMPDEN, loving both old laws
And ancient liberties: that when they drew
Reluctant swords, ne'er forged for brothers' wars,
Still Truth and flight, seen reek of battle through,
In life and death to both were guiding stars.

DEAR MR. PUNCH,

appetite and an unprejudiced taste. Man is a stingy brute, with an
unscrupulous conscience and a squeamish stomach. Hinc ille
tachrymae! (I am a learned pig you-will perceive.) Give a pig a
bad name and—eat him; abusing him afterwards for daring to dis-
agree with you ! That's human justice all over. We porkers call
it ungracious gluttony; #; ! I have no particular ambition
to be eaten at all, but if *...*. deglutition is my destiny I
would fain die with a good dietetic reputation, and escape posthu-
mous prejudice; Were the ban of Moses and ¥Aroºrer made uni-
versal, I should not repine. A pig-like the Premier—is pachyder.
matously imperturbable under spiteful pin-pricks, particularly if
they serve a useful purpose; he will not fume at misrepresentation,

out.us, is a little too bad. I am nice—oh, yes, I am emphatically

I am admittedly delicious. But am unwholesome forsooth !
Bosh!!! Has anyone yet proved that pig as pig is not as salubrious
to discover that,
as sayoury? Diseased, of course, I play the dickens with the dupes
and the duffers who strive to digest me. And serve them right!
But why should I be diseased ? #. been listening to my Echo,
Mr. Punch, and this is what I hear:—
“Two hundred and fifty pounds of diseased pork had been seized (in Glas-
gow) by a Sanitary Inspector. In the course of the trial it transpired that
the pigs before slaughter: seemed dropsical.' . A butcher who was examined
—and seemed to look on the matter with great nonchalance—considered that
this might have been caused by the pigs having been fed on the putrefied
stomachs of diseased horses. When horses became dropsical it was common to
give them spirits of nitre or antimony, and if the pigs were fed on the flesh
of such diseased animals, the disease might be communicated to them.
The witness added that, “it was just in the way of business to dress such
carcases.’”
There!!!...In the way of business!!, And then they blame me!!!
Hrumph! It is disgusting ! Why not brand the conscienceless brute
who feeds his unsuspicious porkers on such foul offal, dealing out
death at third hand from luckless horse to deceived pig; and from de-
ceived pig to gulled humanity! I haye a somewhat undiscriminating
appetite. It is my weakness, and I confess iºn; I have the
misfortune to be carnivorous rather than eclectic. But I have no
preference for disease-gendering garbage, I am not the Reynolds of
my race. Give me wholesome food and Fº of it, I am not parti-
cular, anything from acorns to “hotel tub” will suit me for a change,
lºandº the grateful stomach of the judicious epicure” shall not
suffer post-prandially from me. But diet me on rotten fish, diseased
potatoes, or putrid horse, and if Nemesis takes the form of Trichi-
nosis, or other disgusting disorder, who is to blame?, Not I, but
the money-grubbing miscreants whom it were indeed base flatte
to call “greedy as a pig.” Hrumph! Down on them, dear Punch,
and exonerate your much maligned correspondent,
ToBY.

LADY D1 seated in the barouche, laid her nervous hand on a diamond-hilted poniard
she wore at her girdle. •. -
#. AZAMYLE, who had just returned to herself, trembled. She did not like
poniards.
LAwyER FERRET had arranged it in two seconds with the Bookmakers and Owners.
The Bell rang for the next º
There were no starters, except Moka and the Invisible Prince,
“Now,” exclaimed the Honºlº PULLMAN, “he’s done. With one or the other, he
must walk over the course, and win, Ha! hal”
... But MR. STRINGHALT raised his hat, and begged the Honº" Gentleman's pardon. He
(MR; STRINGHALT) had just purchased the Invisible, and had backed him heavily.
As he had said, the Invisible won. Moka nowhere:
“Hooray!” oried SIR THQMAs, while Lawyer FERRET and the Hon” PULLMAN
absolutely danced with rage and disappointment. -
A, storm was brewing. The Bºokmaker: over two hundred of them, utterly ruined
by ...; LAwyER FERRET and the Hon” PULLMAN's advice, began to eye the pair
threateningly.
There was yet another race.
“Moka must win—shall win this time,” screamed LAwYER FERRET, as with the
Hon". PULLMAN, who was now dressed as a Jockey, he furiously a proached CAVASSON,
intending to tear him from his horse, and throw him down the , when PULLMAN
would get up, and win on Moka.
But it would have been easier to have torn a Precentor from his stall than to drag
the Dumb Jockey from off Moka's back.
“Base ains!” screamed the two hundred ruined Bookmakers, who were no
uninterested spectators of the exciting scene. “Basel

for the treble event.”
But they were not to be mollified with a witticism, and already they were taking off
their coats, and turning up their sleeves.
Yet there was one chance!—just one!
If the Hon* PULLMAN CARR could but substitute himself for the Dumb. Jockey!
Then, once mounted on Moka, he would force the obstinate animal to gallop for dear
life, and, by winning the third 'Derby with one of the Jeddington Dodd Lot, the two pre-
vious races would go for nothing.
Lawyer, FERRET, the Hon. PULLMAN, and CAyAsson the Dumb Jock
engaged in a deadly struggle. The two former, animated by despair, put forth
strength. Aloud shout went upfrom the Bookmakers.

CAvAsson could resist no longer. The sur-
cingle was loosened, the º gave way, and
he tumbled to the ground—an inert mass.
In a second the Hon” PULLMAN was on
Moka's back. -
One flash of the whip ! one flourish of his
spurs in the air! and—he was off.
Qff, but not thrown; Moka's heels were
light and quick, but the Hon” PULLMAN's
seat was as sure, as if he'd been elected
without a dissentient voice.
Moka would not stir.
LARI DI and MRs. Azam YLE screamed, and
waved their handkerchiefs in their frenzied
excitement. -
Gussy, in her brougham, leant back fainting.
Was she about to lose her lover and her hap-
Fºr for ever? Oh, if Moka would only be

move! One of the others might win the Derby,
and Moka be last after all.
Lawyer FERRET suddenly º:
bearing a long §: with bright, gleaming,
attractive vegetables, such as Moka loved,
fixed at one end.
This he gave to the Hon” PULLMAN.
In an instant he saw his plan. A gleam of
hope shone on the pallid countenances of the
Bookmakers.
The Hon*PULLMAN rested the pole between
Moka's ears, so that the tempting bait of
Carrots and green vegetables hung within a
few inches of the animal's clear-scenting nose,
Highly trained as Moka was, yet she was not
gifted with such common sense as might have
told her that no amount of galloping would
bring her one fraction nearer the coveted
prize.
Yet—off she started—full gallop.
A ringing cheer went up from the Book-
makers, who, now ran along by the course,
laying the odds, right and left, on what was,
evidently, a certainty.
What were the odds?
Why, two thousand to one on Moka!!!
And where was SIR THOMAS DoDD P
In the middle of her career, SIR THOMAs,
standing on the top of Gussy's brougham, Was
offering three thousand to one on Invisible
Prince, and taking all the odds he could get
against Moka.
The Bookmakers, relying upon LAWYER
FERRET and the Hon” #º. CARR, took
him in every direction at once. They backed |
Moka for millions. ey were determined
to skin the lamb that day, and the lamb was
SIR THOMAS DoDD. “Done! Done! Done!”
But Invisible, Prince, who has been no-
where at first, is now .# up alongside.
And who has been put up to ride?.
Is it possible? Yes! There is no doubt
about it! There are the black, purple, green, |
red, and orange stripes! - -
It is CAVAsson, the Dumb Jockey of Jed-
dington. -
Tottenham Corner is passed. Moka first,
Invisible Prince second; the rest nowhere.
Suddenly, from the crowd, the report of a |
istol is heard. Moka, thoroughly trained,
º, the signal. She drops, as though shot:
There she lies, quietly eating the carrots and |
the greens, with the Hon*PULLMAN wedged
in, under her. No effort of her Hon” rider
could extricate himself, or get her to move.
There he lay—a prisoner. WYER FERRET
tore his hair, and cursed, but he was borne
onward by the rush of two hundred Book-
makers.
It was WILLIAM BUTTON who had fired the
istol. He had had a long .#. in the
8. business of a Circus, and this was one
of the tricks he had taught Moka.
“Hoorah! Hoorah! Hooplatchk!”
Cheers from the Grand "Stand. Cheers
from the honest public. Groans and execra-
tions from the two hundred Bookmakers.

NEW P
A Query by a Querulous Quidnunc.
“I wish you a Happy New Year.”—Popular Saying.
HAPPY P. That’s doubtful! Pessimists would say
Those who are like to find it so are few:
And of all New Year's deeds from day to day
How many will be New £
What if War's waking bring black fear and sadness,
With parting’s pang to palace, hall, and hovel?
Alas! about that immemorial madness
There's nothing that is novel.
If Trade peace-fostered flourish, then the rout
Of Mammon's thralls old triumphs by old troubles
Will buy once more: there's little new about
The tints that brighten bubbles.
Black-hackle cocks round clerical mare's nests
Will spar, sects pit to-day against to-morrow,
But each new vestment Reverend Mimes invest
From the dead past they'll borrow.
The old political pot-d-few will boil -
With the old hash of all the old ingredients;
ld principles fresh-furbished act as foil
To old re-trimmed expedients.
Neologies galore will take the town,
Mere masquerade—old faces with new masks!—
The frothiest must but proves, when settled down,
Old liquor in new tasks.
Art, new-coined terms upon her tongue, will trace,
With fingers feeble as old hands were furious,
Faint copies of the ancient glow and grace,—
Antiques as pale as spurious.
Poesy, plumed for unexampled flights, ,
Willdeem it soars, while in old mire it
Sumphs vainly seek new radiance in new
Or novelty in novels!
And fools will play their old §. pranks,
Old politicians make their big blunders;
Andjesters scatter time-worn quips and cranks;
And priests roll harmless thunders.
New Years? Alas! I’ve greeted not a few,
ſº ;
ights,
But spite of pseudo-seers who i. and jangled,
I find they've brought me little that is new,
£, much that is new-fangled !
SEAsonABLE QUERY.—If the Mussulman wants muscle for war,

the Poem is not of equal merit throughout we only quote the first Stanza.
A CALL TO THE COAST-GUARD.
(By Authority, according to the “Gardeners’ Magazine.”)
YE Custom-House officers keep a look-out
The coasts of Great Britain and Ireland about,
At all ports, English, Cambrian, Irish, and Scotch,
Against a bold Smuggler far worse than Will Watch.
Look sharp, or he'll smuggle himself, contraband
More fearful than Cavendish, into our land,
Concealed in Canadian cargoes, or freights
Arriving in vessels from Yankeedom's States.
'Cute rascal, he'll try out of vision to hide,
Because he's detected as soon as descried,
Being plainly marked out, as with figures or types,
By colours resembling the Stars and the Stripes.
He looks like a lady-bird as to his kind
But is bigger, and longer from front to behind ;
And the stripes which the vagabond bears on his wings
Distinguish that plague from those innocent things.
His colours, however, are yellow and black,
Some spots of the last at the top of his back,
Five stripes of the same on one side, and five more
On the other; in heraldry Sable on Or.
His name's Colorado; wherever he goes
He devours every precious potato that grows.
Entomology's doctors the title have stuck to him
Of Doryfera decemlineata—bad luck to him!
Look out for this foe, worse than 'tater disease,
Aboard ships, inside sacks, upon wharves, and on quays,
Under sheds, in all packages, bundles, and bales,
In fact anything brought us by steam or by sails.
Tide-waiters, and Searchers, and Coast-Guard, and all,
Prepare on this Smuggler self-smuggled to fall,
To put down a foot on him, wheresoe'er found,
# squash him and squelch him to smash on the ground.
It may not be easy, or possible quite,..
To stamp out a murrain, a fever, or blight;
But at least we can stamp beetles out if they show-
When seen, serve this vicious American so.
The Better Way with Betting-House Keepers.
THE proprietor of a sporting journal the other day pleaded guilty
at §§ to a charge of having kept his house open for betting
purposes, the repetition of an offence for which he was fined £100
about a year . His counsel, on the plea of domestic affliction
and dangerous illness, “asked that he might not be sent to prison
without ºffine.” Sºkoº CARDEN, with some hesitation, decided
merely to fine him £100 and £55s, costs, but added that, “in all
future cases imprisonment without fine would be inflicted on such
offenders.” Perhaps it would be better that they should “not be
sent to prison without a fine,” but smartly fined in addition to being
imprisoned.

- * The House itself.
**. A noble building of
**..., marble and precious
stones, now remind-
ing one of the
Louvre, now of Hampton, Qourt, now of Belvoir Castle. A quaint old place,
within mense stacks of red brick chimneys, heaps of bronze doors, and hundreds
of latticed windows. A home for a CRomwell, a NAPoleon THE GREAT, or an
Edward THE CONFEssoR. At the back, twenty square miles of good mixed
shooting, and a hundred leagues of trout-stream,
The Servants' Offices excellent. A splendid suite of apartments for the
Butler, with a secret passage leading from the comfortable library, into the
cellar. An air º: with cupboards full of plate. A nicely-furnished
Housekeeper's Room, the veryº for wit and comfort, A Servants' Hall
ever ready to extend its hospitality to littérateurs. And the employés, in their
powdered hair and magnificent #: of plush smalls and yellow coats—nice,
amiable, unaffected men, full of anecdotes of Him—the Great Man it is their
ride to serve. From the Butler himself down to the young gentleman in
uttons all equally chatty and confidential.
Up-Stairs. Gold, silvert, and blue brocade. Here is the Hall where the
Great Man puts his umbrella and hat. . That unpretending bronze peg is the
one upon which he hangs his overcoat. Yonder cupboard hides his well-
worn-wide-awake, his hunting-whips, his favourite rods, and his short #.
The Great Man, when he can escape from his followers, delight. in a ramble
across country. He will start at four in the morning, and, whistling to half-a-
dozen dogs (a retriever, two foxhounds, a Newfoundland, a bull-terrier, and
a pug, will, thus followed, hunt for hours the artful rabbit or the wily snipe.
Then he will drop in at a country inn, and dine on the simplest fare—some soup,
a little fish, a few entrées, and a bird: . But this he will do only when he has
Some ticular chum staying with him—such as His Royal Highness fresh
from Marlborough House, or my LoRD BEAconsPPELD.. On State days he
remain in the gold drawing-room, in his simple but effective costume of black
velvet slashed with red satin, giving audiences to the great (and noble.
Courteous to the last degree, he bows his guest into the jewelled chair, and
talks for five minutes. Then he rises, and another eful bow proclaims
the interview at an end. But he is an inveterate smoker, and never appears
without a homely “yard of clay” hanging from between his lips.
His wardrobe contains all sorts of magnificent costumes, #. gifts (in great
part) of his admirers. , Here is the Court dress of a North American Indian,
there the mufti of a Field-Marshalof Peru; yonder (thrown about in confusion)
are a number of patents of nobility. The Orders of Knighthood (of which the
Great Man possesses sixty-seven) are not here to-day. They have been sent down
to the footman's pantry to be brushed up with the rest of the plate.
And how does the Great Man spend his day? At five he wakes, and takes a
.# of tea with two lumps of sugar in it. Then he dashes into a swimming-bath,
and afterwards spends a couple of hours in his private gymnasium. After this
he is ready for his secretaries. Ten of them enter his study (a small apartment,
full of books, desks, and m icent extra-sized chandeliers), and read to him
his correspondence. As his letters number on the average two thousand a post,
his secretaries read them simultaneously to save time. en comes breakfast-
a simple meal of coffee, claret, lobster, mushrooms, muffins, pig's fry (a dish of
which he is º fond) a few pâtés de foie gras, and §. aps a haunch of
venison, or a canvas-back:, . After breakfast, the usual business of the da
commences. From noon till two o'clock he writes. He is a quick thinker, an
works fast. In these two hours he will sometimes knock off at one sitting a
five-act comedy, a draught treaty of commerce, and a three-volume novel. At
two he sees the Ambassadors, giving precedence to the French as the repre-
sentative of an unfortunate people. en come the German, the Russian, the
talian, and the Austro-Hungarian. Of late he has refused to see the Turkish
Ambassador. It is scarcely necessary to add that the Great Man talks to each
foreigner in his visitor's native tongue. After the
Ambassadors come the statesmen, LoBD HARTINGTON
is put into the Red Room, while SIR STAFFORD NORTH-
cote lounges in the Blue.
Even if each visitor should receive no more than the
regulation five minutes, these interviews consume
several hours. At six, the Great Man devotes some
forty-five minutes to recreation. It is at this time.that
he meets his greatest friends en petit cºmité. The brown
boudoir (furnished in the Oriental fashion with couches
and Old Masters) rings with the laugh of ALFRED TENNY-
son, the chuckle of CARLYLE, the soft. “ha-ha”.o
CHARLEs READE, and the boisterous merriment of MR.
GLADSTONE. The rare old glasses at these times mirror
the faces of such men as SIR WILFRID LAwson, the
ARCHBIshop of CANTERBURY, MR. BUCKSTONE, SIR
GEORGENAREs, MAJOR O'Gorm AN, and DR. CUMMING of
Scotland. Then comes dinner, a &:# meal with a
menu a yard long; and then the Great Man goes out to
be petted and fêted by Society, to dance with the
#. of This, and to flirt with the Countess of That.
At these times he refuses to talk business. BISMARCK
may telegraph, and Rothschi LDs may follow him abºut,
but to no good—his rule has not an exception. When
he requires country air, a hearty welcome awaits him at
Balmoral, Sandringham, and Osborne. He refuses daily
invitations from the Elysee, and the imperial palaces of
Vienna, St. Petersburg and Berlin; he hates ceremony
with its guardsofhonour, its court-banquets, and military
reviews. He likes to be with his friends, and when he
pays a visit, only takes with him half-a-dozen of his
§. and a few cordons bleus...And what is the name
of this truly Great Man? The question is easily
answered. he name of this truly Great Man is—
Mr. Punch.
HOW TO USE A CLUB.
NEveR pay your subscription until you have obtained
post rank. M. Clubs fºllº. so suddenly that
it is well to be on the safe side; besides, i. gain the
interest of the money and get your name advertised free
gratis.
Always run down the Club when you are in ; evençall
it a pot-house. The other members will, of course, think
that you belong to several superior Clubs, and love you
accordingly. - -
Always swear at the Waiters. It is not. included in
their wages, but they regard it as a perquisite.
No Club Man, who is wise, ever buys a new umbrella:
Why should he, when so many men daily do it for him?
The time for the best is between seven and eight, when
members are pretty safe in the dining-room.
If you take a fancy to any engraving in the rarer
l library books—out it out when no one is by. If the
Committee inform you that this is dishonest, reply that
that may be their impression, but that you prefer proofs.
When the Smoking-room Waiter, brings you the
cigar-box, ask boldly, and loudly, “Which are the
eighteen-penny ones?” and select quietly a twopenny
cheroot. So you gain at a minimum of expenditure
one of the greatest advantages of wealth. -
Invariably black-ball men who are put up for election
by either your proposer or seconder. As, in nine cases
out of ten we have cause to ń. introducing men as
members of our Club, you will be doing your friends an
unobtrusive yet essential service.
Stare at strangers as though they, were some new
form of wild beasts. You don't pay an entrance-fee and
annual subscription to have your Club turned into ºn
hotel, Besides, other members' friends are always cads.
When the conversation turns, upon books, though, the
only two you know are your laun ess's and an old Ruff,
speak airily of your “library.” That at the Museum is
as much yours as it is anybody's. -
Get hold of a lord if you can, even though it be but an
Irish peer; invite him to dinner, and take, care that
everyone knows who he is. After he is *; shrug your
shoulders, call him “Poor devill” and hint that you
“dessay he's glad of a dinner.” So you score doubly,
When compelled to speak of your three-pair-back,
allude to it as your “chambers;” and to SAILY, your
fifteen years' old maid-of-all-work as your “man;

Pocket the Club stationery. . It is far cheaper than buying your

Wear your hat in every part of the house. It informs strangers
of the fact that }. are a member, and is an altogether dignified
and becoming method of asserting your proprietorship. This is a rule
to be rigidly observed when any member happens to be showing a

that, while you are compelled to tolerate their presence, you are by
no means certain that they are not swindlers and vagabonds.

OUR BENEFICED DISSENTERS.
FRIEND PUNCH,
IT is verily gratifying to see friends E. F. CROOM and
J. PLIMPTON, Churchwardens of St. James's, Hatcham, and up-
holders of friend Tooth in his defiance of the law and the Court of
Arches, seemingly in a way to arrive at a sense of his position and
their own. Thou hast doubtless read their letter to the Times,
wherein they say:—
“We are not such a small body as many think; the English Church Union
and the Church of England *...i. Society together number more
than 25,000 Churchmen, and these do not represent a tithe of those who sym-
pathise with us.”
If not so small a body as many think, the party they belong to is
a minority not perhaps as large as they imagine. As to the “tithe
of those who, sympathise with them,” how much longer do they
suppose members of the Church by flaw Established are likely to
continue paying tithes to Clergy whose followers have at last be
to discern them to be ministers of another denomination ?
above-named friends go on to testify as follows:-
he
“It is said we are lawless. No more lawless, I take it, Sir, than Noncon-
formists were when they refused to pay Church-rates, which were then imposed
by the law of England £º. their goods to be seized rather than give
up the principle for which they were contending—that citizens should not be
compelled to support a religious institution against their consciences; so we,
for principle, are determined to suffer loss of property, and of liberty if need
be, for the maintenance of the right of the Church of England to govern her-
self in spiritual matters without interference from secular authority.”
When friends CR00M and PLIMPTON, on the part of friend Tooth
and his adherents, describe themselves as representing the Church,
those three said friends doubtless remind thee of three other such,
the celebrated apparel-makers,of Tooley Street, who styled them-
selves the People of England. Whilst, however, with one breath
our Hatcham friends claim to typify the Church whose Government
they disown, thou seest that with the other they compare themselves
to Nonconformists; and it may be hoped that they soon discover
how nearly they resemble them, the resemblance being precisel
such as one pea bears to another. They persist in practising rites an
ceremonies of their own, and refusing to conform to those of the
Established Church by flaw-matter of ritual prescribed by that
Law as . by its legal Judges; and it is notorious that
their Nonconformity as to postures and gestures signifies Noncon-
formity of opinions also. erein, then, do their Ministers differ
from friend SPURGEON, friend PARKER, friend NEWMAN HALL, and
the Nonconformists who sit under those and other Nonconforming
friends? In two important but unessential particulars. . They
preach and practise their Nonconformity within the steeple-houses
and other edifices of the Establishment, instead of Salems and
Ebenezers of their own, and they sack the Establishedſhire, other-
wise it is manifest to every creature above a donkey, and, from the
avowals above quoted, appears to be i. upon even their own
intellects, that they are all of them, laity and clergy, no more and
no less out-and-out thorough-going Nonconformists and Dissenters
thanfriends CHADBAND and STIGGINs—Dissenters and Nonconformists
though of a different colour from the drab which distinguishes the
“vestments” of thy broad-brimmed Friend, OBADIAH.

EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES.
IT may be that the relation existing be-
tween education and crime is precisely the
reverse at Manchester of what it will be
found to be º: else. The Chaplain
of Manchester Gaol the other day read a re-
port declaring the experience of the Assizes
and Sessions at Manchester to show “that
mere reading and writing have been the
instrumental means without the use of
which the forger, the embezzler, the frau-
dulent trustee, the base coiner, the false
begging-letter writer, the dishonest ware-
houseman and clerk, and such like,. could
not ever come into existence as criminals.”
Perhaps the development instead of the pre-
vention of crime by education is peculiar to
Manchester. Otherwise School Boards will
not be found such economical institutions as
it was predicted they would: An outlay in
education rates, instead of being repaid by
reduction of county rates will simply neces-
sitate augmented local taxation for prison
expenses. But let us * it is an excep-
tional and not a general fact, that the

WHY STIR HIS STUMPS P
WHAT, in the name of common sense, could the Vicar and Church-
wardens of Wadsley Bridge have meant by objecting to the bat, balls,
and stumps on the tombstone of BENAMIN KEETon, the Cricketer,
with the *g and Christian inscription, which, thanks to the
kindness of a Sheffield Correspondent, a Čricketer too, Punch is
glad to be able to append:—
“Farewell, dear wife, my life is past:
My love was true until the last.
Then think of me, nor sorrow take,
But love my Saviour for my sake.”
Altogether we never heard of a more creditable gravestone: nor is
this professional symbolism a new thing in the tombstones of those
É. The Wigar and Churchwardens may see in Wadsley Bridge
hurchyard a Musician's tombstone, with its music-bars and #.
notes of HANDEL's sublime strain, “The trumpet shall sound and the
dead shall be raised,” carved upon it; and a Blacksmith's, charged
with the hammer and pincers flanking the horseshoe of his grimy but
useful occupation.
Did not the Vicar at least know—whatever the Churchwardens
may have known—that in the good old times this carving on the
tombstone of the implements of the sleeper's handicraft, beginning
with the Soldier's sword and the Dame's distaff, was an almost
universal *ś And bat and balls were KEETON's tools as a
professional Cricketer.
Then, if we turn from the practice in the matter to the principle
at the bottom of it, where can be the objection to what is a mere
record of the sleeper's craft—true labour wherein was one of his
life's best, prayers, qui laborat, orat, but a record addressed to
the eye, at once picturesque, and encouraging local art; instructive,
as showing what trade implements have been; directly intelligible,
and more vividin its appeal to the memory than any, description
in words would be, while infinitely closer to the fact than most
monumental enumerations of the virtues of the departed—your
grave-stone mason being the one recorder who observes the law,
more charitable than honest, de mortuis nil nisi bonum. . . .
The more Punch considers the matter, the more he feels inclined,
instead of objecting to the practise of such, symbolic stone-cutting,
to wish it were everywhere restored in English Churchyards, till the
proverb ºld run “True as a tombstone,” instead of “False as
an epitaph.
e are glad to find that Wadsley Bridge Wicar and Churchwar-
dens having thought of it, have naturally thought better of it, and
ave determined to leave Benjamin Kerron's bat, balls, and stumps
where his widow has placed them.

of the native Chiefs, and by the delivery of the Proclamation,
spoken }. BARNEs after an º flourish of trumpets;
only the Proclamation was not, as it mightſhave been, cast in heroic

ficent fairy present to turn any of the characters in the scene into
Harlequin and Columbine, not to mention Clown and Pantaloon.

macy over barbaric magnificence assumed and asserted by Civilisa-

THE ENDOWMENT OF RESEARCH.
“Govern MENT FUND of £4000 Fort THE PRomorrow of SciENTIFIC
ResEARCH.-The President and Council of the Royal Society have resolved
to advise the Committee of Council on Education to expend the above-named
Fund in aiding Scientific Research:–1. By conferring grants on Competent
Persons, or by offering Prizes of considerable value for the solution of Pro-

able of these appeals.
GENTLEMEN,
FoR years past, I have consecrated all my leisure to per-

the most Oriental imagination to realise. I am as certain as I am
of the rise of to-morrow's sun, or the visit of the tax-collector, that
a grant of £50–or, to prevent the possibility of failure, say £100–
would enable me to bring my experiments to a successful issue, and
confer on the Royal Society the enviable distinction of having been
the medium of revealing to the world a long latent secret.—I mean
that of Perpetual Motion.

FIELD PERSPECTIVE
(FOR SOFT WEATHER).
“WOMEN'S WORK IN THE CHURCH.”
THE legend of Pope JoAN may or may not be authentic; but the
ssibility, at least, of a female Pope is manifest from the positive
fact that there are female Parsons. For this is a fact beyond all
doubt. A great many, if not the greater part, of the Ritualist
Clergy are evidentl -
sex, have gone to Theological Training Colleges, got themselves or-
dained, and crept into the Church in disguise. Now, when they have
obtained curacies and livings, their irrepressible passion for finery
crops up. They bedizen themselves in all manner of gowns and petti-
goats under the name of “vestments,” and they decorate the Churches
in which º officiate, or have them decorated, in a style of orna-
mentation befitting only boudoirs or dressing-rooms. , A Lincoln-
shire paper, itself º, edited by a girl, reports under the
head of Claxby, in a sympathetic spirit, particulars of some recent
ecclesiastical adornments, of which the conception, is evidently
feminine, or at any rate the product of a man-milliner's brain.
..º. perhaps, suggested some of the fal-lals under-
In entioned :-
“SAINT MARY's CHURCH,-We are pleased to hear that several handsome
offerings were made to this church, on Christmas Day, by parishioners, more
than a hundred of whom had shown their appreciation of the many privileges
they enjoy in this sacred edifice, devoting some portion of their substance to
provide the necessary adjuncts for the worship of the altar. The gifts, pre-
viously set apart to the use of the Church, consisted of a complete set of nicely
embroidered altar linen (the veils surrounded with lace), a white silk veil and
burse, richly embroidered in gold; a book-stand for the altar, a pair of vases,
a pair of vesper lights to hold six candles, these all being of polished brass.”
All this reads exactly like the description of a lady's boudoir:
The altar with appurtenances such as “nicely embroidered linen,”
“veils surrounded with, lace,” a “white silk veil, and burse richly
embroidered with gold,” a “pair of vases,” and “a pair of vesper
lights to hold six candles,” must as nearly as possible resemble a
toilet-table. The vases may be taken to be meant to hold perfumes,
the six candles held in the pair of vesper lights to # beside a
looking-glass, and the book-stand to support a fashion-book. Such
an altar can be imagined * as an altar of Venus, or but an altar
figuratively so called, an altar of Beauty, at which she sits and
worships herself. No male Cleric could possibly permit the altar at
WOL. LXXII.
adies who, having contrived to conceal their |:
which he serves, to be tricked out in the fantastic manner above
specified. Altars, so tricked out, however, are now numerous; and
the Clergy who, direct or permit their decoration may style them;
selves Priests, but are unquestionably Priestesses, every Reverend
Man Jack of them.
The “altar” at St. Mary's Church, Claxby, seems to have been
arrayed besides with trappings of which some may be pictured by
º as setting off a sort of doll, or dummy. In continuation
of the foregoing account of the habiliments and trimmings it is
garnished withal, we are told that—
“A member of the guild presented a handsome white silk frontal for the
altar richly embroidered in gold and blue with stoles of the same. A glass
water cruet, having upon it the sacred monogram, and a prettily worked mat
for the fold-stool, were the offerings of another. . . . We need scarcely add
that the church, as usual at festivals, had been beautifully decorated. The
altar and reredos were clothed with the light of countless candles.”
An altar described as clothed not only with “the light of count-
less candles,” but also with a “frontal” and “stoles” embroidered
in pretty colours, presents the confused idea of , something not so
much like an altar as an image, or effigy. Perhaps the altar that
has been clad in stoles will next be attired in skirts and a long
train, and the frontal it has now on will be supplemented with a
§. Anyhow we may be assured that all the clerical Persons,
with whose sanction or by whose arrangement altars have been put
into that attire, are qualified by gender to wear the like themselves.
Many people expect such ecclesiastics to show the cloven hoof. They
will never do that exactly, but it is more than probable that before
long one of them will put out from under fringes and flounces some-
thing like it—a foot embellished with a fashionable high-heeled
fancy shoe. And perhaps the Court of Arches will soon be further
set at defiance by Clergywomen playing Priestesses, and, notwith-
standing inhibition and force of law, continuing to masquerade not
only in the Millinery they now wear themselves, but insisting on
dressing up their Churches as gaily and gaudily as their persons.

While others held the only hope was getting
The patient to a health-resort in Asia.

charging the house of LEwis AND ALLENBY with “sounding the war-

with organising a claque to applaud these ladies. MR. A. J. Lewis
writes, requesting Punch, as he has requested the Times, Telegraph,
Daily News, and Standard, to say there is not a word of truth in
the paragraph. He has called upon Truthto make public his denial.
In doing so, Truth, in effect, reiterates the false statement, though, in
terms, withdrawing the charge against MR. LEWIs in person.

borne with tolerable patience, in the hope that either
from repletion, or shame, the opposite Sex would desist
from their monopoly of that costly luxury the Oyster.
They may be seen daily ranged in rows along the
counters where these expensive bivalves are dispensed,
like beetles round a dish of treacle, gluttonously devour-
ing (regardless of cost), and depriving us of our home
share in the seductive shell-fish.
Now, do be kind enought Mr. Punch, to persuade those
dear Oysters to give us an “At Home,” and invite us to the

of the “Finding of the Body of Harold” for twenty years, without
attracting the least attention. How, weary year after year, those
magnificent compositions used to go into the Royal Academy in a
furniture Yan, and return to their native studio on the top of a
growler.” How REYNoLDs lost his Aunt, and came in for a legacy of
a few thousands. How he hit upon the notion of asking the Royal

his enthusiastically belauded “Duchess” cannot be compared for a
moment with the once despised “Harolds.” They say, these critics,
that the blossoms of his neglected ºf . were grander in
conception and nobler in treatment than the fruits of his ripe and

Before entering the cottage, look at the two policemen on the
opposite side of the road. It is their function, no sinecure either, to
keep order, among the string of coronetted carriages in waiting,
in rear of the three voitures de maître. Strangers might imagine
that the great painter was giving a matinée musicale, but the
initiated know #: the carriages belong to DAUBSON's aristocratic
sitters. A third policeman stands on the door-step. It is,his duty
to keep order among the titled crowds, who struggle, for entrange.
Half an hour ago his services were called in to quell a riot. To
rescue a leader of ton from being torn in pieces, was nothing for
the sub-inspector—a civil officer, who thoroughly knows his duties
—but to take two Duchesses into custody!. Their Graces—why
were they not three ?—are at; this moment enjoying the new
sensation of five-o'clock tea in the station-house.
Let us enter the cottage. . The hall is rather low and small and
darkling—the subtly-calculated preface of an exciting book—but
cosy. É. the walls hang plateaux of blue and white china of
the Wang dynasty–DAUBson values no other—and old English cups
and saucers of grotesque shape, flaring colour, and priceless value.
The hat-stand is of ormolu. On its pegs hang two hats—one very
old, one very new. If }.} glance into them, }." will see the name
of fºunsos, R.A., on the lining. He keeps the old one in memory
of his days of unaided struggle and blithe Bohemianism; the new
one he wears on the rare occasions when he finds time for a drive in
the Park. From how many a lordly carriage coquettish Brough-
ham and aristocratic Alexandra his abstracted smile is courted all
the length of these drives so few and far between! Look from the
lining of those hats to the crown, and you will see the name of
SMITH of Regent Street. He trusted the º}. for his first
hat, and now participates, as of right, in the golden showers, whose

showed him kindness in the days of his dwelling in Bohemia.
From every hole, and corner look out upon you, with sightless

walls runs a high dado of ebony, crowned with a grey-green paper
aringly #ed with withered chrysanthemums (from the Art-
urniture works of MoRose AND MAKEBELIEVE). At one end a
towering buffet of black, 9ak lined with green velvet, and laden
with massive antique gold and silver, plate, now glittering, now

flushed, with strained yet severely repressed expectation.
await their Master! -
Suddenly the º shakes—is drawn. The sitters put on their
most amiable, and, affable expressions, as through a secret door
appears a burly yet refined-looking man of some six and thir
ty—or
Lady, forty—with immense red whiskers and a shock head o
by’r
#####: hair. He has fierce, leonine blue eyes, deep set under|s
a gnarled brow, and a red scar runs from the right corner of his left
eye obliquely to the root of his nose. Ask him of that scar, some
day, and perhaps, if the Clicquot has done its work, he will tell you a
tale that has blanched many a fair cheek, and added all the more
charm to that fascinating if rough and reckless face. He wears a
doublet and knickerbockers of -
stockings. On his massive yet delicate fingers are diamond rings,
whose brilliance defies, the curiosity that would count them. Such
is the simple yet costly suit in which REYNoLDs DAUBSQN, R.A.,
always º before his distinguished and dainty clientèle.
“My Lords, Ladies, Honourables, and Right Honourables,” he
exclaims, in a voice short, sharp, and saccadé, “I cannot give you a
sitting to-day—I have other fish to fry!” -
There is a loud murmur of consternation. The Great Artist turns
fiercely and points to the door. It will not do. The sitters have
fought hard for their places; they have been waiting for hours;
they are naturally, dissatisfied. Not one stirs. With a scornfui
smile the Great Artist points his hand towards the vestibule, and in
a twinkling the bevy of fair women with the Qamelot chins º
down their novels, are ousting from their chairs Dukes an
Duchesses, Peers and Peeresses, Statesmen and Soldiers, and posing
in their places. -
During this brief but stirring scene DAUBsoN has been wheeling
out a small deal table, with a range of compartments divided by
wooden partitions, a lump of distemper colour in each, and in the
centre a pot of smoking size. How is this? This is a scene-
painter's palette Even so. Dashing aside the tapestry, DAUBSON
reveals to us a huge canvas on a frame stretching from roof to
floor, and worked up and down by a powerful winch...These pale,
|...". models are not to figure in a composition for the
Royal Academy Exhibition... In one of those freaks, so charac-
teristic of his daring but erratic genius, DAUBsoN is working to-day
at the Transformation Scene for a provincial Pantomime ! -
Such is his good pleasure. Le Roi de l'Art le veut-ainst soit-il.
In this way DAUBson's genius gradually infiltrates the provinces.
He is a true populariser of the beautiful. These nymphs and houris,
these Elaines and Enids, who are now being transferred from pale
and passignate flesh and blood to distemper and canvas, will live
again in glowing reality, suspended against blue depths of air from
the flies, or grouped voluptuously amid the corals, and *:::: of
a fantastic ocean-world. DAUBson only designs the scene. It will
be for more common-place creatures to realise it.

A STRIKE IN THE BRIEF BUSINESS.
According to the Carlisle Patriot, Ministers have been, tempo-
rarily at least, defeated in an attempt to effect what Conservatives
will applaud as a large economy in contrastyith the small cheese-
parings practised by the late Government: In consideration of the
rising prices of provisions, and most other things, the Treasury
announced, at the Carlisle Quarter Sessions, through MR. NANsoN,
Clerk of the Peace, that they would in future allow Counsel only
one guinea a brief, instead of two guineas as theretofore. The
consequence was–
“The Barristers declined to take the reduced fee, and there was nothing
left to be done save for the attorneys to place the briefs in the hands of the
Court, and let it deal with the matter as it thought best. Accordingly, when
the Deputy-Recorder (MR. Leofrtic Temple, Q.C.) had concluded his charge
to the grand jury, MR. WANNor handed in a brief marked “one guinea,’ at
the same time saying that there was a strike among the Barristers, who would
not accept the briefs at the fee allowed. MR. NANson said the matter had
been brought before the Deputy-Recorder, who had arranged to pay the two
guineas on this occasion. MR. WANNor—“Then I may mark the briefs two
ineas P’—“Yes." .# after this announcement the Barristers came into
Jourt, and the threatened block was averted"—
by MR. NANson's generous act of self-sacrifice. No doubt that
Gentleman undertook the responsibility of the additional guineas for
which the Treasury may or may not reimburse him. But what will
be the consequence of the adoption by the higher branch of the
legal profession of Trades Unionism both in principle and practice?
A system of picketing may shortly be established in connection with
Sessions and Assize Courts for the purpose of intimidating and
molesting Barristers who dare to accept a reduced scale of fees.
Gentlemen of the Bar will, ratten forensic knobsticks, by carrying
off their briefs and books, or hiding their gowns and wigs. Barristers
may eyen, by-and-by, blow Barristers up, after the manner of Sheffield
sawgrinders—who knows?... Such are the deplorable consequences
which may be expected to follow from perseverance on the part of
Her Majesty's Government in the attempt to cheapen the price of
legal labour; the present remuneration of which is far too Liberal
in the estimation of Conservative Statesmen.

ereupon, Moka rose quickly, kicked out at the prostrate form of the
Honº" PULLMAN, and tiº off.
Along the course, with deadly precision, advanced the whole corps of the
Royal Welshers.
.Then, the, two, hundred, Bookmakers, ruined utterly, rushed forward,
with, a terrific yell, to wreak their vengeance on LAwYER FERRET and the
Honºlº PULLMAN.
Lawyer FERRET and the Hon” PyLEMAN “went for" over two million,
but neither of them got it, except from the two hundred infuriated Book-
makers, and then they got it hot.
These pitiless savages knew. they had to do with men of straw.
It was a fearful scene.

The Hon” PULLMAN CARR contrived to get by the Midland line to Liverpool.
Thence he went to America.
LAwYER FERRET escaped in the darkness of the black night, and, unable to
}. a cab, managed, with a Solicitor's keen experience, to convey himself to
ndon. Only his confidential clerk could have recognised the crafty Lawyer,
as he arrived by appointment at the entrance to §". Gardens (his
shortest and most secluded route to the Metropolis), drawing up his own con-
veyance. Eluding the vigilance of the à. and the watchfulness of
the Keeper of the Seals, LAwYER FERRET crept up to the Tank House fol-
lowed by his clerk.
The worst man in the world has some one to care for him. LAwyER
FERREI wept. The Clerk having been a copying clerk in his youth, was,
from the force of early training, compelled to imitate him. Then the
Lawyer, placing his hand on the Seal, which had come
out exºting something to eat, murmured in a low
voice, “I deliver this as my act and deed.”
But there was no time for further parley; the two hun-
: ruined Bookmakers were on the wretched man's
rack.
LAwYER FERRET pulled from his pocket a draught.
It was ºne of his own drawing, and he knew beforehand
its deadly effect. He bade the Clerk give it to him
slowly. The Clerk obeyed, and gradually, slowly but
surely, Lawyer FERRET went on until % had taken
down the entire draught.
Then the Clerk left him; for he knew the end had
come, at last.

END OF THE SPORTING NOWEL.
To THE PUBLIC.
Erplanatory Note, by the Editor.
We owe it to our readers. Unfortunately, the last Chapters
of the Novel were in print before we were able to return to town
and prevent their publication. We saw through it at the
commencement, at least we mistrusted it as a Sporting Novel,
and had we been only a little less diffident, we should never
have permitted the intelligence of our readers to be insulted by
having this work foisted upon them as a genuine Sporting Novel
by a true Sportsman.
We have been grossly deceived. We admit it. But never
again. There is no such person as MAJoR Jawley SHARP
We never met him at a friend's house; no conversation ever
took place between us; he is totally unknown, to CAPTAIN
HAwley SMART, whose Novel, Bound to Win, in Bell's Life,
is, though in different vein, not a whit behind his other suc-
cesses in Courtship, Two Kisses, &c., and in fact, the whole
affair is a swindle from beginning to end. Unfortunately, we
have only just discovered it; not, however, without consider-
able trouble, and at great personal inconvenience. The pre-
tended Major had invited us down to “Bogus Park, near
Boshey,” the Station for which place he said was Ware. A
friend of his—perhaps the Impostor himself in this character-
called at our office, and, after telling us that we were expected
the next day at Bogus Park, where our room was prepared,
where there was a quiet horse at our disposal, and the best ºf
everything awaiting our arrival, he received from us,a, hand-
some cheque (luckily, on account), for, which he said he was
authorised to give a receipt on behalf of his friend MAJoR. J. S.;
who could not come up to town, it being a hunting day, and
Bogus Park being full of visitors. He departed, and the next
day we started for Ware, intending to arrive at Bogus in time
for dinner. On descending at the Station, there was no carriage
to meet us, but a boy stepped forward on hearing our question
put to the sº: as to the whereabouts of Bogus Park,
and delivered a letter in the Major's handwriting. It apolo-
gised for not sending a carriage, but begged us to take a fly, at
his expense, and tell the man to drive straight to the House, a
distance of about six miles, when, to prevent any contretemps,
he (MAJon J. S.) would send to meet us at the Cross Roads;
“And,” added a P.S., “don’t forget our dinner-hour is 7:30
sharp.” We gave the boy sixpence, who immediately disap-
peared, and a fly having been found, we stowed Fº our luggage
(two portmanteaus, a carpet-bag, a hatbox, and rugs), and started

for Bogus. Park, which the Flyman said he thought he knew, but wasn't
sure; adding that, “Anyhow, if the Gentleman's agoing to meet us at the
Cross Roads, about six miles from here, that'll be all right, as I think I know
which cross roads he means.” It was by this time six o'clock, but there was
an hour and a half to dinner, and though it was a trifle colder than in town,
and the rain was beginning to come down pretty heavily, yet, at all events,
there was a cheerful room to look forward to in an º country mansion, a
hearty welcome from a hospitable Squire, the best of everything, a brilliant
party, and dinner at 7:30 sharp.
Thus meditating, we fell into a dreamy doze, then into a pleasant slumber.
We were awoke by a sudden stoppage. It was dark. The wind was howling.
The rain was beating against the windows and sides of the fly. The driver,
shivering and drenched, opened the door, thereby admitting a hurricane and
a shower, and said, “’Ere's the Cross Roads, Sir, but I don't see nobody.”
“We must wait,” we said, cheerily. “ No doubt we are a little before our
time.” Our watch marked 7:30 exactly. We had slumbered for an hour and
a half. , “You’ve been a long time,” we said, reproachfully, to the Flyman.
“Wery bad roads this time o' year,” he replied.
..We waited. Seven forty-five!. The Major had told me, in his letter, that
dinner was at “7:30 sharp.” Evidently, he had got tired of waiting for us,
and had gone home to dinner. Too of him, or too bad of the Fl for
being so long over the Journey. There was nothing for it but to drive on.
“As no one is coming,” we said, still cheerily, so as to keep the Fl in a
good temper, “ you had better drive on to Bogus Park.” º irection’s
that in, Sir?” asked the Flyman. “Why,” we returned, “don’t you
know? It's Major JAwley SHARP's house—MAJoR Jawley SHARP, the
t Sporting Novelist, the Country Squire; he has a housefull of company;
e hunts regularly. Why, hang it!” we said, being a trifle exasperated §
the blank, puzzled expression of his countenance, “you must know where
MAJoR JAwl EY SHARP lives!” “No, blessed ifi do,” he replied, empha-
tically. “I’ve lived in these parts, man and boy, for a matter of thirty year or
more, and never heard tello' such a name, or o' such a place as Bogus Park.”
There was a pause. We reflected on bucolic ignorance; we debated within
ourselves by what means we could bring the Major and his mansion tº this
rustic's memory. e Flyman's eye winked. He leered at us! Aha! he
knew: we felt he knew at last. e #. spoke. “I say,” he observed,
cunningly, “You’re flºw your tricks on me / But it won't do. I knows
one as good as two o' that 1.”
This was irritating. We put it to his common sense, “What on earth
could be the fun to us of driving about Hertfordshire, hungry and tired, in
the wind and rain, for the sake of playing a practical joke on an unknown
flyman?” He listened to reason, and presently it occurred to him that he
did know a place answering the description we gave of what we supposed
Bogus Park to be like, about five miles off. To this place we drove. It was
nine o'clock before we arrived. After some delay at the Lodge, we were
informed that no one of the name of MAJoB SHARP lived there, or was
known in those parts. The old gatekeeper thought she had heard the name,
some years ago, when she lived with her Aunt on Goose Green, the other side
3. the county. Her little boy suddenly remembered that there was a Major
omething who hunted, and #. in a Park, about seven miles off. -
was a gleam of light. Having rewarded the boy with sixpence, we drove on.
Twice we lost our way. It could be hardly called “losing our way,” as we
were in utter ignorance of the locality, and the Flyman knew very little about
“this part of the country.” . By dint of climbing up signposts, with a car-
riage-ſamp in his hand (which, fortunately, he was able to light), and reading
the directions, we managed to make some F. northwards. For miles
and miles we drove, but no sign of any big house could we see. Parks there
were, indeed, but no Lodges visible, and no gates. The roads were rough,
sloshy, stodgy, and, in many parts, evidently only used by the heaviest earts.
At last, the driver took a wrong, turning, went bumping and stumbling
down a narrow lane, and, finally, the weary horse stuck fast in the heaviest
clay soil. On each side was a ooded ditch; in front was a gate leading into
a field. The rain was pelting worse than ever. The Flyman hadn't the
smallest notion of where he’d got to. Then, for the first time, we began
to lift up our voice, and bless MAJoB JAwl.EY SHARP. And, all the while,
we knew that the last chapters of his idiotic Sporting Novel were being set
up in type, and we should be unable to get back in time to prevent its
publication. Cold, hungry, wet, miserable—not so wet as the Flyman,
though—we asked what could be done? The Flyman suggested that he
should take the lamp, go through the gate, enter the plantation, and walk
till he found some Keeper's lodge, where he could make inquiries. To this
we assented. He disappeared, leaving us in the lane, in charge of the fly and
horse, and one lamp. Tor an hour we awaited his return. He did not return.
It was nearly twelve before we decided that the only course was to turn the
fly round, and drive back into the road. We began trying this. The lam
went out. The horse wouldn't do what we wanted. e coaxed, pull
struggled, and were in a perspiration of despair. The horse was dead beat, an
stumbled. In anothersecond the flygave a lurch, and was over—luggage and all
—into the ditch. While we were executing a sort of clog-dance in the º
slosh, wasting our strength in vain endeavours to find our hat and umbre e

that when he had entered the plantation, he had been captured as a poacher
and locked up. The expenses of that night, including damages to horse an
fly, were enormous. Prostrated by a severe cold, and unable to move, we
searched county guides, read the history of Hertfordshire, and examined

We went down-stairs. Where was the Quiet Horse?
No one knew .* about such an animal. The brave Commissionnaire
at our front office door, suddenly remembered that a man had called yesterday,
from a second-hand furniture shop, and, on receiving half-a-crown, on our
account, in our absence, from our head-clerk, had left a common painted deal

Major's hand—
“The quietest horse out. I told you so. If I'm JAwLEY SHARP, you are
JAWLEY GREEN.”

Tied to it was an envelope, on which was written, in the

There was also a note from CAPTAIN HAwley SMART, Author of Bound to
Win, now running in Bell's Life. We place it before our readers:—
Dear Sir, I have not the smallest idea who the personcalling himself MAJoR
JAwl EY SHARP is. I do not know him. I have never heard of him. From
his Novel (?) I learn that he is grossly and stupendously ignorant of all
matters connected with Sport. Whenever and wherever I meet him, I shall
give him precious good cause to remember the impression made on him by
#. sincerely, H. S.
This settles it. The Detectives are engaged. We fancy the Major is not
unknown to the Impostor who, some time ago, pretended to accompany
H.R.H. the Prince during his Indian tour, and sent us letters from “You R
REPREs ENTATIvr. IN INDIA.” If so, we think we can put our hand on both
at once. Nous verrons ! It flashes across us suddenly as an idea that the
boy who appeared at the Ware Station, with a letter from the arch-impostor
and to whom we gave sixpence, was the very boy whom long ago we entrusted
with half a sovereign to go out and buy an Anglo-Indian Dictionary and who
never returned. # so, he has become one of this gang of swindlers. He may
yet be reclaimed,—if we can only catch him.–ED.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“WHAT'S DOING AT THE THEATRES P.”
F all the hits in the
Drury Lane Pantomime
this Christmas the hit
has undoubtedly been
the Donkey. . The
talented person inside
the asinine frame wi
be hereafter as distin-
guished a character as
was the clever repre-
sentative of the Turtle,
in Babil and Bijou,
who received the sobri-
uet of “TURTLE
ones,” to distinguish
him from every other
Jon Es.
At Covent Garden
Robinson Crusoe is a
bright spectacle, with
plenty of practical
comic business between
Robinson, Friday, Fri-
day's father, and the
highly-trained animals
in the hut. The musical
rtion is good throughout. Capital Pantomime fºr children; and
his, after all, is the great point. They don't carghoy lºng it is.
But the hit of the day-literally of the day, for, it is only per:
formed in the afternoon—is thº-Pantomimeat the Adelphi, played
by children. The Pantaloon seems to be a very old man for his
age, which, we believe, is something under twelve:
The glittering, gorgeousness, and zoological variety of the grand
“Conference Scene” in Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver rolled into
one by the MEssRs. SANGERs, surpasses all previous efforts of that
enterprising management. -
Then at the Crystal Palace, among much else that is pretty and
ingenious in Sinbad the Sailor, there is a Harem Scene, with the
most graceful dance of Odalisques, dressed in snowy muslin, that
}.}has seen for a long time. It shows how much more charming
ladies of the ballet look in long clothes than in short ones...The
Transformation Scene here, on the classic fable of Narcissus and Echo,
is a masterpiece of mechanical ingenuity as well as scenic effect.
The Extravaganza-burlesque at the Globe gives us a mixture of
old and new styles, being a revival of MR.PLANCHE's gracef
Invisible Prince, with modern tunes. The chorus to the old air
“Hark! 'tis the Indian Drum !” is most effectiyely rendered, and
deservedly encored. Miss JENNY LEE, as the Invisible Prince, is
uite a Prince Charming, and being invisible, ought to be seen to
#. appreciated. She is ably seconded by Miss RACHEL SANGER and
MR. GEORGE BARRETT. -
How they pack that crowd into the pit and gallery of the
Strand, is a marvel! and what shouts from every part of the
house at MR. JoHN S. CLARKE's inimitable drunken : scene in
The Toodles, which, it is worth, knowing, comes on about nine
o'clock. His “business” with the pipe and the candle is im-
mense. As for the Burlesque, the scene of The Lying Dutchman
is where MR. MARIUs and MR. TAYLOR go through an acrobatic
performance on a trapëze. Miss LottſE WENN and MR. HARRY Cox
are invaluable in burlesque, and they make the most of what ".
have to do. MR, HALL's Scenery in both pieces, especially, the ol
country town in The Toodles, and the view of Margate in the Bur-
lesque, are two of the most effective “sets” we have seen for a
long time. The scenery of late at the Strand has been unusually
good, notably in the late lamented Princess. Toto. -
Of the Danischeffs at the St. James's, William Tell at the Gaiety,
Jocko at the Princess's, and a few other, novelties, we are, in a
position to speak with the strictest impartiality, not having yet seen
any one of them. Of course it will be a Christmastide duty to visit
MR. CoNQUEST at the Grecian. - -
Some years ago we had the º of seeing a piece at the
Vaudeville, played by MEssRs. JAMEs and THORNE, entitled Our
Boys. These Boys—wonderful life preservers—are still floating, as
buoyantly as ever. They will become one of our National Institu-
tion; and friends from the country will come up to Town to see St.
Paul's, Westminster Abbey, Madame Tussaud's, Gog, and Magog,
and Our Boys. Temple Bar will be a thing of the past, new streets
will have been built, the Royal Family will be residing in a palace
built on the site of the old Westminster Aquarium (so as to be near
the Abbey for service on Sunday), Turkey will have been reformed,
the Thames embanked from one end to the other, and our grand-
children will be enjoying Our Boys, then at the height of its
popularity.

DEAR SIR,
TwenTY-FIVE years' gradual softening of the brain, first
gaught from my poor husband—whose, own mental decay was
brought on by his abandonment of himself to the destructive
Fº of playing upon words—had almost reduced my faculties
the level of his, when a valued friend recommended me to take in
Punch. I did so, and have since lived chiefly on your invigorating
weekly issue. The effect on myself was so marked and immediate,
that I induced my unfortunate husband to try the same remedy.
In a week the fits of punning, from incessant, became intermittent,
and after a month's use of your elixir, ceased altogether. He has
not since that time had any return of the attacks, while I am my-
self quite restored to my former vigour of body and mind.
I remain, Mr. Punch, yours, gratefully,
Chaffyng-Abbas, Herts, CLEMENTINA Jolly.
SIR
UNDER the fearful monotony of a perpetual curacy in one
of the dampest districts of Lincolnshire, where I thought the livin
would have been the death of me, and alternate attacks of menta
º and bodily “shakes”—as the ague is locally called—I
had entirely lost my spirits.as well as my ...; At last I had
lost the power of even smiling at my churchwarden's standing joke
about a “cure of souls” when he called on me at my lodgings over
the shoemaker's—the glebe-house being under water during the six
winter and autumn months, and uninhabitable, from damp, duri
the rest of the year. I hai gradually dropped all intercourse wi
the neighbouring county family—a bachelor with a liability to
delirium tremens... I was rapidly following his lead, and becoming a
victim to the habit of mixing gin with the water of the locality,
unster to reason.
ul when, by an accident I cannot but call providential, I invested in
a complete edition of Punch, and for three months, when not
employed in parochial duty, was busy in reading, marking, and
digesting its invigorating contents. I am now a new man. I have
given up my gin. I sleep well at nights. My congregation, on the
other hand, never so much as wink during the whole of my sermon,
though six months ago you could not have seen an open eye in the
church after the first five minutes. Such are the marvellous effects
of your life-giving food upon a grateful fen-parson,

Mr. Punch that since one of her great-nephews the other day sent
her his Seventy-First Volume, the LADY M. M. has found herself
able to snap her fingers in the face of her Pºp! creditor, Old

him. Her figure has regained much of its youthful spring, and onl
the other night she was almost taking part in one of the pas de
Pokes with two of her grandchildren, after their return from the
Drury Lane Pantomime. She even caught herself making eyes
at that absurd old GENERAL METHUSALEM, with whom she used to
dance at Bath in 1810, before he went out to the Peninsula, when, at
LADY M. M.'s last “small and early,” he asked her to join him in

LADY M. M. wishes to inform Mr. Punch that she is as fresh as a

A SHIP OF THE DESERT'S HARDSHIPS.
SANGER's STABLEs, Jan., 1877,
ALLAH be with you, Lord of a million readers!
May your shadow never be less! Know, O Sheik of St. Bride's, I
am no poet, not even the most distant, relation to the Bulbul: I am
an unhappy Dromedary, torn from his home to smell sawdust, and
curse the Afreet known as the Djin of Pantomime. But, O PUNCH-
BASHI, I bear a hunch on my back, and, without wishing to be per-
sonal, I feel I have a claim through that protuberance upon your
special sympathies. - -
I could almost break out into cursing, but I feel that to indulge,
however excusably, in the habit of swearing acquired from my
fellow-prisoner, the Zebra (who chafes fearfully under a captivity
which adds to the stripes that nature has laid on his back those in-
flicted by an irate groom), might lower the Oriental dignity and
calmness of my style.
But, O PUNCH-BASHI, have I not cause for swearing? . From
Arabia's burning sands, decoyed into the strong-smelling hold of a
steamer, I find myself, after §. agonies of a sea-voyage and an in-
terval of subsequent confinement with a batch of sick monkeys and
a flock of swearing parrots in JAMRACH's anything but commodious
premises in the É.i. Road East, transferred to the dark
stables of a circus! Here, after some rough discipline in the ring, I
learnt by intermittent conversation with several small elephants, who
rub on a dreary existence in the same place of º: that I was to
appear, in a few days, as a feature in a great Christmas attraction!
is was a flattering idea, doubtless, and a new one, for I knew of no
Christmas in the land I left, and no attraction º extra graze
of thorns and thistles, and water enough to my five stomachs
to the brim. But I soon discovered from one of my worst-used
fellow-captives, the biggest elephant here, who was painted white
last year, in his assumed character of the sacred iamese, what
#. in a Christmas Attraction in fact meant. With him, poor
fellow,
Allah be praised, they have not this year made a Pink Drome-
dary of me, but it is bad enough to have to carry a bevy of spangle-
splashed Amazons, to breathe an asphyxiating atmosphere of gas-
fumes, exhalations of sawdust and stable, manure, and to be
blinded by the lime-lights of the Giaour. My spongy feet, alas !
were never made to tread the London boards!
I used to bear my Arab master over the hot desert, speeding,
without, a murmur, with a swinging stride, and outstretched neck
across the scorching Sahara, while we sniffed together the balmy
breeze which met us from the far-off oasis' And then at night,
the unloading of the caravan, the savoury repast on the sparse thorns
of the desert, the too-brief slumber as we, the ships of the desert,
lay at anchor, hobbled beneath the stars 1
Now I wait at the wings for my cue, duly accentuated by a kick
in the ribs and a tug at my muzzle, in a crowd of jostling supers and
insufficiently cladballet-girls, men in armour and caparisoned horses
—my abomination—and when I pass from the side-scenes to the
stage, if, dazzled by jets of flaring gas, and deafened by the blare
of discordant brass, I stumble or turn s , the street Arabs pelt
me with orange-peel from the Gallery, and my gaolers run me in
amid cheers of derision.
It is the last straw which breaks the camel's back. It is the last
spangle which will crush the Dromedary's. For know, O PUNCH-
FFENDI, the accursed company into which I have fallen have made
me ambitious in their own low way. I can sacrifice my desert home,
I can forget the sands of my foalhood, to gratify my last—perhaps
foolish—craving, but I shall die broken-hearted if I stay in the rank
and file of the “Grand Conference” scene—as one of the mere
“utilities,” two- and four-legged—for one night more!
If I must go on in the Pantomime, let me at least figure for once
as the feature in the Transformation Scene. I feel that if I might
only go up on an iron frame surrounded by flights of Peris, I shall
not have been torn from my native deserts for nothing. We all
have our weaknesses: this is mine; and I appeal to you, O Caliph
of Fleet Street, by your influence with SULTAN SANGER to aid my

“MUSIC HATH (C)HARMS.”
THE Judge of the Westminster County Court has decided that a
nuisance may be “intolerable” but not “actionable,” but whether
as "damnum absque injurid,” or “injuria absque damno,” is not
stated. We are sorry for the poor plaintiff who has both to tolerate
the intolerable nuisance, and pay the costs of trying to get rid
of it. The nuisance complained of is an organ measuring about
twelve feet in height, ten feet in width, and four or five feet in
depth, and occupying about half the room in which it stands. This
room is directly under the chambers of the plaintiff, a literary man,
MR. WARE—he should have been “Wear and tear” to have borne
unmoved such an infliction as that described in his pathetic expe-
rience of organic disturbances.
“When the organ was tuned after being fitted up, he asked how long the
operation would last; on being told two or three hours, he went out for that
time...The organ had beenº: at different periods since, about two or
three times a week; he stayed in once for about three hours during which it
was being played, and found that it so interfered with his comfort and the
rformance of his work, that whenever it commenced he had to leave the

Will any one of the dear Spirits present be so kind
as to shrink and subside into a bottle? Will it allow
itself to be conveyed in the bottle to 85, Fleet Street,
and there disembottle itself with manifestations audible
or visible to Mr. Punch f
A TAX IIARD TO BEAR, BUT HARDER TO GET RID of.
THERE are, great complaints of the Paddy-tax in
Ceylon. "England is not without considerable experience
of the pressure of the same impost. It has been found
one of the heaviest of the many she has to bear. ... But,
unlike Ceylon, she is not likely to get rid of it just
yet.
had occupied the chambers for four or five years, and had expended a con-
siderable amount of money on them. The music was very bad, and very
common airs were played.’
The man who plays these common airs so uncommonly ill on this
uncommonly potent instrument of torture, is a solicitor; and he
brings two other solicitors as witnesses that the noise is no nuisance.
It seems that we should replace the old Scottish proverb, “Hawks
dinna pike out hawks' een,” by “Hawks dinna cleave hawks' ...
One Solicitor went so far as to say that “the music did not interfere
with the performance of his work, nor was it any obstacle to conver-
sation; he had given his clerk instructions while it was being
played.”
We can quite believe this. We can easily imagine a will, con-
veying real estate, being dictated with even more sprightliness than
usual to the inspiriting tune of “Tommy, make Room for your
Uncle;’’ or a codicil, bequeathing a substantial legacy, cheerfully
puº into proper iegal hraseology to the sentimental movement of
“Then you’ll Remember Me.” So a divorce case might be drafted
to the strains of “Take back the Heart thou gavest ''' or a letter
insisting on payment of a milliner's bill to the inspiriting melody of
“The Gainsboro' Hat; ” or proposals for the arrangement of a
threatened action for breach of promise set forth to the lively ditty
of “He’s not a Marrying Man.”
The Literary Man brings an Artist and a Doctor of Science to
corroborate his testimony. But what right have literary men,
artists, and doctors of science to more sensitive nerves, or more
impressible brain-structures, than lawyers? Above all, what chance
has one literary man against three attorneys? His Honour decided;
with the sagacity of a Sancho, that the nuisance was “intolerable,”
but not º which the only parallel we can think of is
Dogberry’s “Most tolerable, and not to be endured.”

Just now the interior is scarcely seen at its best. MR. ALLSPICE-
FIATHERs (since his marriage he has prefixed the surname of his
wife to his own) is always influenced by his better half, and the
gifted Lady-Novelist has recently taken up the ideas of DR. RICHARD-
son. Thus, the kitchen of Green Holm is being carried, piece-meal,
from the basement to the roof; all the floors are being covered with
sheet-iron and cement, and the waiis with porcelain quarrelies; a
staircase is being constructed separate from the rest of the building,
and a conservatory and play-ground for, the children (where many
a merry game of cricket will be essayed in days to come), is being
covered in, on the roof–at once hanging garden and sky-parlour.
But still there are two rooms sufficiently comfortable, even in this
tangle of ladders, bricks, and mortar. One is for the boys and girls,
the other for Papa and Mamma. The first, combines a gymnasium
with a lavatory. Look in, and you will see the lads and lasses climb-

paste and scissors, is CHARLEY, already (at nine) an author º some
repute. MRs. ALLSPICE-FLATHERs is an ardent mother, and brings
up her little ones after a fashion of her own.
... Enter the other room, and you will find yourself in a laughter-
inviting apartment, full of large easy-chairs and º: tables.
Round the walls books of reference, rare books upon all the sciences,
encyclopaedias, dictionaries of all sorts, and grammars of every
language. Here is a º: edition (in one volume) of MANGNALL's
QUESTIONs, there (well worn, and scored all over with pencil-marks)
the Annual Register complete from the commencement. Six goodly
shelves are devoted to the novels of the mistress of the house. The
rest, of this choice selection (scarcely five thousand volumes all
told) is composed of sets of Dickens, Bulwer, Thackeray, Mark
Twain, Wilkie Collins, Ainsworth, De Quincey, Dumas (pêre et fils)
Scott, Artemus Ward, Macaulay, Disraeli, Tennyson, Ouida, and
the Author of Little Arthur's History of England. On the floor of
this cosy room are files of the Times, Daily Telegraph, Morning Post,

and Daily News, from the commencement of each of the journals
named up to the present time...MRs...ALLSPICE-FLATHERs is rather
proud of this collection, and seldom allows a visitor to leave without
ºliº to her industry in “picking up papers.” For the
rest, the study is full of proofs, reams of foolscap, small printing-
resses, gallons of ink, stacks of pens, and scores of waste paper
{. You can scarcely move a step for desks. Here is one at
which MRs. ALLsPICE-FIATHERs writes, up-standing. Here is
another, with a chair in front of it, “et tout ce qu'il faut pour écrire.”
as the French stage-direction has it. Qveryonder is a tiny table of
ebony and ormolu, laden with proofs in course of correction, and
in odd corners are leather-covered secrétaires. Looking round you,
as you sit in this pleasant room, so redolent of work and, comfort
ou cannot help envying the husband of the gifted occupant his good
#. e. This Benedick, at any rate, has drawn a prize in what
may be aptly called the luckless lottery of monotonous marriage.
And how does this accomplished Lady pass her world-enriching
life? A sample day will answer the question. She is up, long
before the lark. She dashes into the nursery and kisses all her
children; and, in good sooth, it is a pretty sight to see the mother and
little ones together. Men and women who read Marriages Galore,
Bigamy and Trigamy, Maud, or the Divorced. One, and other works
of this gifted woman's—for which the cry at MUDIE's is still “Give!
Give!” till all the presses of SporriswooDE & Co. can scarce
supply the demand—would stare to find their favourite Authoress
80 º and devotedly domestic. Then she rushes off to order
her husband's breakfast; then tries on a new dress or a new
bonnet; then sits down at the piano, and runs over an opera or
two in a rich, luscious, and soul-stirring contralto voice, full, of
nerve-thrilling notes that remind one of a cathedral organ. By this
time breakfast is ready. It is a quiet cozy meal, eaten between
seven and eight.
She loves her husband with all her heart, and the affection is
returned. For ten minutes there is pleasant homely conversation
about MARY's cold or ALICE's cough, and then the Authoress begins
her work for the day. But not at her desk. Far otherwise. She
catches an early train up to Town, and is in London before the
clocks have chimed eight.
Qnce in the Great Babylon, armed with a gigantic note-book, she
seeks admission at the dismal door of Newgate. It is a private
execution morning, and next week the world will be startled by the
§. description of “Death on the Scaffold” that will appear in
hapter XLVI. of Ben Barlow's Bad Bargain, now appearing in
monthly instalments in the classical pages of Seven Dials, the most
Pººl. of our more sensational Magazines.
hen the sad task she has set herself, is over, the devoted
Authoress hurries away to Westminster Hall. As she trips up the
steps of a certain Court, all the officials bow to her. She is as well
known as the Judges on the Bench, or the leading Counsel. Good;
natured policemen grin, and bright young Barristers in the Hall tell
their fresh country, cousins that yonder fair creature, with the
golden hair (alas! a little streaked with silver), with the slim figure,
the Princesse dress, the emerald ear-rings, the well-fitting yellow
gloves, and the bright beaming smile, is the celebrated Authoress
whose works are so highly improper that the very mildest of them
runs through half-a-dozen editions in a fortnight. Now and again
a suppressed hum of applause runs through the crowd, which she
acknowledges with a grace all her own. As she enters the Court
the Judge rises and beckons her to the Bench. Then his Lord-
ship passes her his notes. Every one likes and respects her, and is
ready to give her a helping hand in her work. Hour after hour she
gathers materials for her next novel. If the case is tried in camera
an exception is made in her favour, And so the hands move round
the clock until four is boomed out by Big Ben in the Palace of
Westminster overyonder. -
To dash into a hansom, to drive like mad to her pied-d-terre in
St. James's, to “make up” with a wig and beard, and to assume
the sable, swallow-tail and etceteras of full, fashionable, evenin
dress, is the work of scarcely two hours and a half. Thus disguis
she roams from Club smoking-room to Club smoking-room, and
learns many a secret of our sex, for the benefit of her own. In
the sacred cause of Art she learns how women are tempted and how
men fall. Those who watch her smoking strong gigars and §
stronger brandies and sodas, would be surprised if they were tol
that the Cynic before them was a warm-hearted, generous-minded
wife and mother, and yet so it is. The Lady-Novelist must write
about men and women as they are, and where is the knowledge of
them to be found if not in the ºming air of the smoking-
room, or the disclosure-laden atmosphere of the Divorce Court-ah,
where indeed! - -
. At ten she drops into the private box of a transpontine theatre (it
is here she gets many a hint for her plots), and by midnight is once
more at home—in the bosom of her family. Seated hand in hand
with her husband, she talks over the domestic events of the day.
But not for long. Her desk claims her. After two hours' writing,
she gives over work and takes up a small, red leather-covered book.

LIGHT READING WITH A VENGEANCE.
Keeper of Circulating Library. “I’m vKRY soHRy, MIss, THE THIRD Volume HAPPENs still To BE out; BUT HERE IS THE ENTIRE
Novel, IN ONE WolumE l’”
Young Lady. “OH, THAT won't Do I How on EARTH AM. I. To FIND MY PLACE IN IT?”
ON THE CLOSE OF A CONFERENCE,
FINIS coronat opus / Never sat
A better meaning Conference than that
Just now put out by the Imperial Hatt.
Easy it were to raise the scornful laugh
To poke cheap fun; and heap unsifte chaff
On the Wise W. strong diplomatic staff,
That cracks and bends and breaks and lets us down,
And lays low more than one Imperial crown
Under grave MIDHAT's fez and stubborn frown.
Was’t that the Turk the game of brag read right,
Foresaw that Russ tall talk would not mean fight;
And knew IGNATIEFF's bark worse than his bite?
Or fathomed Austria's plight, by dual law
Forced now with Slav, ; now with Turk to draw,
And felt ’twas safe to ride on that see-saw P
Or was’t that BISMARCK bred more hopes than fears,
Whose interest should be to lop Bruin's ears,
Scarce feed him fat on Turkey—for some years?
Whate'er the secret of the Turks' sang-froid,
He looked cool, and he was cool: dans son droit :
Borgne parmi les aveugles, et partant Roi /
And blew his bubble Constitution bright,
With brave French colours tricked in rainbow light,
And bade young Turkey spread tail at the sight.
And ere he made the Conference “shut up,”
Helped them to Humble Pie, and in their cup,
For bitters, gave them failure's gall to sup.
Let not the scorn of scoffers rub aside
This salve to ruffled self-conceits applied, -
“We have done buffers' work—be that our pride.”
And let not SALISBURY his fate deplore:
No credit he has lost on Stamboul's shore :
For he that does his best can do no more.
And had the British Lion meant that he
Should raise a voice to sound from sea to sea,
He’d but to will, for what he willed, to be.
So ends the Conference; shall we say “for good,”
With Christian wrongs unrighted, claims withstood?
Best not halloo, till well out of the wood.
“A Thing no Fellah can Understand.”
In an article of the Cork Examiner, on the 13th ult., on the
recent Election for Sligo, we read:–
“CAPTAIN KING HARMAN, who was yesterday returned unopposed for
Sligo, will very likely sit on the Conservative benches, though he will vote
on all Irish questions with the rest of the Home-Rulers. His family has
always been the leading Conservative º: in the counties of Sligo, Long-
ford, and Roscommon, and are possessed of great territorial influence. The
new Member created a great impression in Irish politics at the time.*
Though he º. as to property, two titles, he bears none. He holds all
or more of the estates of his grandfather, Lord Lorton, on one side, of his
uncle, Lord Kingston, on the other.”
Given the last sentence of the above, as the terms of the problem;
required, to find what estate CAPTAIN KING HARMAN does hold.
* Query, What time?
WHAT we want To see IN THE NAVY-The Engineer “hoisted”
not by his own petard, but by rank, pay, and consideration.

people now-a-days, probably, are
aware of the existence of a Bouzy
wine; and certain Spelling Re-
formers will perhaps suggest that
the name of that wine, considered as
descriptive of its effects on those

cable to all manner of “intoxicating

The New System of Chancery.
GREAT complaint is made of the
“Law's Delay” prevalent under the
* New System” in the, Court of
Chancery. There is said to be a
“block” in the Registrar's Office;
another block in Chambers; a block
in every department of the Chan-
cery Division. Hence it appears that
the “New System,” a in
Chancery is in fact the “Block Sys-
tem.” Strange. The desideratum
of our Railways is the opprobrium of
our Courts of Law.

FASHIONABLE CHITCHAT.
(Adapted from the American for the English Market.)
CHARLEY HEADLONG married LADY “Dolly” SPANKER on
Tuesday. The wedding cake (supplied by MESSRs. SweeT AND
PLUMB) cost over seventy guineas. The old woman (the Bride's
mother) was awfully cut up, and cried until her complexion was
utterly spoiled. This was not strange, as the Dowager's favourite
brother has recently died of typhus fever.
By the way, 3 propos of the death to which I have just alluded,
there were eight hundred and ninety-seven silver nails in the coffin.
IAM very fond of Waiters, and know a large number of them.
As this is the case, I may have something to say about the Smoking-
Room Talk in several leading West-End Clubs next week.
A HORSE-whipping doesn't hurt when you are accustomed to it.
I AM accustomed to hang about stage-doors after the performances
are over. A well-known actress (for whom I have the most pro-
found respect) took an omnibus from the Strand to Clapham on
Friday. She got out some little distance from her house, to save
payment of an extra penny. And yet they say “the Profession”
are improvident,
I DINED the other evening with LADY BRowNJon Es Robinson.
The soup was too hot, and the fish too cold. The entrées were
easy, and the birds tough. The ice pudding tasted as if it had
n manufactured in the kitchen of a third-rate pastrycook. It is
only just to say (in answer to certain unpleasant reports that have
been current of late) that LADY BRowNJoNEs. RoBINson's husband
was in attendance... Poor fellow, he looked a little mournful. Once
only did a “guest” address him, and then it was to ask him “To
be good enough to pass the salt.”
IHEAR, on excellent authority, that a certain Illustrious Person-
age has ordered half-a-dozen pairs of new boots.
IWENT to see some Amateur Theatricals the other day, and the
performances had a terribly depressing effect. am not much o
an actor myself, but I think, were I asked to play, I should go in

WE understand the answer as well as the question:—
“What is the night?
Almost at odds with morning, which is which.”
We do not seem to fancy that .# and morning, described as at
odds with each other, are said to be falling out. But in the following
advertisement, cut from a Dublin contemporary, occurs a passage,
which, if parallei to the Shakspearian statement foregoing, is com-
paratively obscure:–
IF any of the Gentlemen who witnessed the Collision near the Mater
Misericordiae Hospital, between one and two o'clock on Wednesday, the
; inst., will communicate with W. 324, office of this paper, he will much
obilge.
It is too much, perhaps, to hope that the collision above alleged
to have occurred between One and Two o'clock, was merely a figura-
tive sort of clash into which one of those hours somehow came with
the other; no bones broken—as they might be if the Hours in Ireland
travelled by rail. It seems to have been a visible collision, from
the intimation that if any of the Gentlemen who witnessed it will
communicate with “W. 324,” he-that is, of course, “W. 324”—
will much oblige. But, whom will “W. 324” oblige, and how, and
wherefore? Presumably “W. 324” is one of those Preservers of
Public Order by the English populace not too respectfully styled
Bobbies. Although he may be a thoroughly efficient Constable, his
diction is certainly less perspicuous than such as beseems an officer
of that intelligent body the Irish Police. Query for Earlswood-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HINTS ON HOUSE-BUILDING;
Or, How to Make Home Happy.
R. PUNCH has read
with a great deal
of pleasure DR.
RICHARDson's ex-
cellent Lectures
upon our hearths
and homes. Ever
ready to assist in
the cause of
health and com-
mon sense, the
Sage of Fleet
Street begs to
supplement these
lectures with a
few hints of his
own.” It will be
seen that the proposals of Mr.
Punch and DR. RICHARDSON are
equally practicable:- .
Staircases. – These incum-
brances should be abolished.
There is nothing more fatiguing
than going up and (in some
cases, e.g., after a joyous dinner)
nothing more dangerous... than
coming down stairs. In lieu of
the Staircase a trapeze should
be rigged up. ith a little
practice, every member of the house hif be able to º: himself
or herself from landing to landing: The exercise will be found in-
finitely more beneficial to the muscles than stair-climbing, and, from
an artistic point of view, will prove exceedingly pleasant and even
graceful.
Wall Papers.--These collectors of dirt should not be tolerated;
What is wanted is some cheap, useful material that will wash and
supply, in an unpretending fashion, heat in winter and light in
summer. If this material, by its peculiar properties, abolishes fire-
places and chandeliers, so much the better. It should also (when
needed) supply pegs for hats and dresses. It might, too, change
colour to suit the furniture. At present such a material does not
exist, but its discovery should lead to, a very valuable patent.
üntil this material is invented, the walls of rich people may be
lined with tin, to show that they are well to do. The office-walls
of lawyers might, appropriately, be faced with brass.
The Kitchen.—This apartment should be on the º
outside the roof. Its new position will do away wit
caused by the odours of cookery,
The Nursery.--It is obvious that this room should be on the top
of the house, and also outside the roof. Noise ascends, and children
should always have the highest (id est, the purest) air.
The Library.—The Study, it is scarcely necessary to say, should
be on the top of the house and outside the roof. Reading in
pure air is a healthy exercise. Reading in anything else is the
reverse.
The Drawing-Rooms.-This suite should be always situated on
the top of the house, and outside the roof. The view of the adjacent
.# will be finer from the top than from the basement of the
ulloung.
The Bed-Rooms.-It is superfluous to say that these chambers,
in which good air is an absolute necessity, should invariably be built
on the top of the house, and outside the roof.
The Garden.—For the sake of convenience, no better spot could
be found for pleasure-grounds and kitchen-gardens than the top of
the house-outside the roof, of course.
Windows.-Aslight is life, there can never be too many windows
in a house. As a rule, it may be coneeded that to every foot of
brickwork there should be a yard of glass. Care, however, should
be taken that there should not be too much glare. Thus, an
unnecessary window should be bricked up immediately on its
discovery.
Doors.-These wooden barriers are ...Tº the cause of much
illness. Were there no doors there would be no draughts. Under
these circumstances doors should be unsparingly abolished.
The Dungeon.—This is a new but very necessary addition to the
comforts of a home. No household conducted on truly economical
rinciples should be without one. If the house is a castle, the
#. should be constructed beneath the moat. It is scarcely
necessary to say that it should be used as a Fº of secret confine-
ment for the Tax-Collector, who may be cajoled into the hall by in-
of the house,
the nuisance
HIGH CHURCH COMEDY.
THE Wenerable yet humorous ARCHDEAcon of TAUNToN seldom
opens his mouth without saying something remarkable. As, for
instance, in moving a Resolution of defiance to the Court of Arches
at the Meeting lately held by the English Church Union in the
Freemasons' Tavern, to consider the Hatcham case. He said that
the Court which had inhibited poor MR. Tooth “ought to be called
LoRD PENZANCE's Court; ” that he “knew no more shameful pro-
i.", than that that Court should sit at Lambeth; ” and that
LoRD PENZANCE's Court was “a name by which it would go down
to the odium, and execration of posterity.” His hearers laughed
not unnaturally, at language which reads like that of a preacher o
Temperance, who has taken too much tea, abusing beer.
ARCHDEAcon DENIsox is reported also to have said:—
“It is a very fine thing to come here cheering one another, and passing
Resolutions by acclamation; but what are we going to do for the Priests of the
Church of England—those who will be brought possibly very soon under the
claws of LoBD PENZANCE * (Laughter.)”
More laughter; naturally again; laughter, at the idea, of LoRD
PENZANCE with claws. A_funny idea, certainly. Couldn't our
Archdeacon work it out? Is he able to draw? Then he might put
LoRD PENZANCE on paper, with claws and all the other extras to the
human form which they imply. Perhaps he will favour us with a
sketch of him thus delineated.
Our impayable Archdeacon proceeded as follows:–
“I believe that Priests will follow the example of those two men who have
fought the real battle; our dear friend MR. Purch As, who was killed by it
(“hear, hear !'), and our dear friend ARTHUR Tooth. (Prolonged cheering).
And there is anotherman who has been killed too, our dear friend DR. Dykes.
(“Hear, hear !"). Well, MR. Tooth is looking forward to dwelling in a
prison during the remainder of his life; and, if I know the man, I must say
nothing in this world will ever take him out of it (cheers); and if I had to go
to prison, I should like to go to prison with him. (Laughter.)”
The tables set in a roar again by a Korick equal to SIR WILFRID
LAwson—of course only joking. We live in happy times compared
to those in which real martyrs were killed, and genuine Confessors
sent to prison. Our venerable Porick can have no real fear of
having to go there along with MR; Toorº...Moreover, a prison is
not the institution to which any Judge with the requisite discretion
would commit such defendants as those concerned in the pranks
which, ARCHDEAcon DENISON's friends have been playing at St.
James's, (Colney) Hatcham.
Natural (History) Question.
MR. PRoctor, in his Lecture on the Sea Serpent, says:—
“The Mermaid, again, has been satisfactorily identified with the Manatee,
or “Woman-Fish,' as the Portuguese call it, which assumes, says CAPTAIN
Scoresby, “such positions that the human appearance is very closely
imitated.’”—Times.
Has the Manatee, or “Woman-Fish,” any connection with the
modern Man at Tea—the Ladies' fish—the great creature at five
o'clock kettle-drums ?
Rill and Not Cure.
ph on Vaccination in the Times, the President of the
Anti-compulsory Vaccination º is stated to be “a Clergyman
of the Church of England, but happily (according to the Clergy
List) without cure of souls.” Happily, perhaps. But then if †.
had cure of souls he would have business of his own to mind—might
possibly mind it, and, by having his attention occupied with curin
souls, be withheld from opposing the prevention of small-pox, an
so promoting the propagation of disease amongst bodies.
IN a para
A FALLING OFF.
OLD BUTTONLEss, the bachelor, complains that whereas informer
times his friends sent him at Christmas a dozen brace or so of birds,
he *ºnly receives by post a couple of dozen or so of twopenny
Robins!
TWo WAYS OF LOOKING AT IT.
THE Court of Exchequer has decided that cutting cocks' combs, is
cruelty to animals. But if you don't cut cox-combs they inflict
themselves upon you, and on which side is the cruelty to animals
then 2
sidious politeness, there sprung upon, seized, gagged, garotté, and
plunged into the dungeon.

“CLoups in the East.” No wonder, now the Conference
has ended in smoke.
SIGNS OF THE SEASON.
GREAT preparations are being made for the ensuing Season, which,
the Court Newsmen assure us, is to be more than usually brilliant.
Mr. Punch has received visits from the fournisseurs, and own men
and maids of the élite of Fashion, who all assure him that no efforts
will be spared on all hands this year to make London a vortex of
elegant entertainment.
LADY DIGBY HolePICKER has passed the entire winter in tracing
to their foundation all circumstances and scandals affecting the
débutantes of the Season. Her Ladyship has investigated all par-
ticulars of their fathers' properties, and portions, their own expec-
tations in the way of settlements and pin-money, and their pecuniary
as well as personal “figures.” LADY D. H. hopes also to be in a po-
sition to give her friends the exact facts relating to all the com-
promising connections, unfortunate attachments, runaway matches,
and actual or probable elopements, separations, and divorces, which
formed the chief topics in distinguished circles in the course of last
Season, and at good visiting houses through the autumn and winter.
LoRD HAUTENBAs has made his usual New Year's distribution of
bon-bons, as retainers at the tables where he expects to have a
seat kept for him º the approaching Season. Lord H. has
passed several weeks in handicapping his friends' Cooks, and in
arranging, with his entertainers in futuro the people to be colá.
shouldered and invited where he dines. His Lordship has not quite
settled which Opera-box at both houses shall have the distinguished
honour of his patronage. Several nouveaur-riches are competing
for the preference.
ToMMY TAMEgAT has been diligently working all his Clubs in
succession for the last three weeks, and is now engaged to dinner
every day for a month from the opening of Parliament. He has
taken; notes of every tit-bit of i,j. scandal and exclusive
gossip, and every high-flavoured double entendre, he has been able
to pick up in his autumn rounds, and has almost finished arranging
them according to the tables at which he means to bring them in.
He has also got into working order his choice stock of assorted
WOL. LXXII,
compliments, to match the capacities and styles of his hostesses in
prospective, with quotations, from ALFRED, DE, MUsset, ByRoN, or
BRowNING, for cases where the recipient is likely to understand the
French or appreciate the English. ToMMY has also been concluding
beneficial arrangements for the Season with his tailor, his boot-
maker, and job-master, on the mutual principle of limited patronage
and unlimited credit. -
The HoN. MRs. LucRETIA SLYBoots has been damaging her diges-
tion at five o'clock Kettledrums with every conceivable decoction of
Assam, Congou, and Orange Pekoe, for the purpose of clearing her
character from those odious imputations which that horrid MRs.
GRUNDY has been spreading about her without the slightest founda-
tion. MRs. S. has been seen at Church every Sunday and Friday
since New Year's Day; and if that absurd man, GoDFREY STALKER,
will leave his regiment to come to the same Church, for the same
services, is it her fault P. Is not the idea quite too supremely
ridiculous? Isn't it dreadful to think what wicked things people
do think of other people ! If people would only mind their own
business!
BIANCA, WESTAI is coming up for her first season. She can
scarcely sleep for the preparations she is making. She has got no
money to speak of, but, thank goodness, she is pretty enough to be
adored without, and rose tarlatan does become her so quite too
awfully, ºl. stephanotis in her hair—and º the
Prince dotes on stephanotis. And she is to be presented by LADY
Digby HolºpickeR, who is so kind; and if she should be asked to
Marlborough House, won't it be quite too awfully jolly!
- Ritualist Venison.
THE sympathy of the #. Church Union with MR. Tooth
may be heightened by a feeling peculiar to Englishmen—admira-
tion of an offender who shows himself game. Undoubtedly the
contemner of the Court of Arches is game to the backbone; but
the game is too High.

“HELP yourself!” is a good rule, and a capital text, on which
MR. SMILEs, some time ago, preached a sermon by examples, with
the title of Self-Help. The moral of this sermon is summed in the
old proverb, “God helps those who help themselves.” For there
indeed lies the strength of “Self-Help”—it is God's help. And
now MB.SMILES has preached another sermon on the same text,
called The Life of a Scotch Naturalist. It is the wonderful true
story of a wonderful true man—THoMAs Edward, Associate of the
Linnaean Society, and,5outer, in Banff; a story to bring tears
into the eyes, and to fill the heart with sadness and gladness: a
story to make those who read it better, humbler, and gentler, and,
above all, more thankful to the Great Father of All, who can so hi
mysteriously teach, and guide, strengthen and lead up one of the
humblest of his children, from eleven years of age tif sixty-three

wº of §. a-week.
...THQMAs Edwarp has lived two lives. There was first the humble
life of the hardly brought up son of a poor weaver; scholar, now
and then, for brief spells, of brutal dominies; next apprentice of
a drunken ruffian; then toiling bread-winner for a brave and true

man who helped himself. -
But side by side with this life he was living another-of.com-
munion with the wonderful works of God, who took upon himself
this part of his teaching, instead of the dominie with his taws and
cane; binding him apprentice to nature, instead of drunken CHARLEY
BEgg in the Gallowgate'; and after his days of sordid stooping over
uppers and § at waxed-ends, giving him nights of wonderful
intercourse with all living things; appointing him “the beasties” for
books, and the silent hours of darkness for his school-time; and holes
in dykes or bields under stone walls, or bits of crumbling ruin, for
is school-rooms. This was the man helped of God. -
If you want to know how THoMAs Edward lived those two lives
side by side, helping himself manfully under the heavy burdens of a
poor man among poor, men, and letting God help him ...;

URBAY.
And you will read, too, how close work at the cobbler's stool by
day, and wandering and watching and lying out by night, wrestlings
with winter's winds and frosts, drenchings with rain, wettings from
seas, tumbles from cliffs, with long fastings, and spare’fare, at best,
of oatmeal cakes and water, played havoc with a strong body, so that
at sixty-three, THOMAS EDwARD is an old and §. In all.
In the same book is told the touching story of this man's loneliness
and disappointments: how, under the pinch of hard times, he had,
in and again, to sell the collections he had so laboriously made,
which he straightway set to making over again, like RoBERT BRUCE's
spider; and how the prophet, honoured as he was by wise and famous
men far away, was not honoured in his own country-Banff bailies,
and Banff bodies, and Banff souls, being too high—or low—to see the
poor souter, bowed over his work, and so lower still.
But you will not, read in the book — for that came after it
was written—how the QUEEN and LoRD BEAconsPIELD, having
read the story of THoMAs Edward's life, were moved by a common
thought to put THOMAs Edward on the Pension List for a modest
fifty º; a year, so that for the rest of his life he may give
himself wholly to the reading of God's Book of Creation, without
being a burden, to the children who have been true and helpful
stays to him thus far. For among THoMAs Edward's other
good *:::: from God, is a good and wise wife, and they have bred

to this stout-hearted and rarely-endowed man, craves leave—as the
highest honour should come the latest—to offer this his tribute of

wits and wags
and (at Yuleti º

There, a many-

that might have
--- - served good QUEEN
BESs for a villa, in the days when young WALTER RALEIGH was ignorant of
potatoes, and had never smoked tºbacco. . A sleepy, glaring, sun-stricken
street in the summer, and in the winter a desolation of ice and rain and snow.
A short cut for the lonely hansom, dashing from cumbered Covent Garden told
renewed Leicester Square—those “Fields,” where man of wit and pleasure
met man, * to rapier, in the days gone by. A very new street, and yet
an old one. The very place for an actor's dwelling—full of old memories, with
many a good tap and cosy tavern within easy reach, and boasting a name that
wears the crown of histrionic art. It is in this street of .# fancies and
rich stage associations that J. K. S. SLoggºº has pitched his tent. Many years
ago, when he was struggling as a provincial Hamlet, he was content to be
bounded in an attic, but now, in the full glow of success (when his usual terms
are half the gross receipts and a clear benefit), he rents a flat. Few of those
who gaze at the six yindows of his rooms, guess that behind those costly
curtains of lace, lives the Great Actor of the day, in a very museum of dramatic
art., And yet so it is...SLoggRR is too comprehensive an artist, to be fettered
by the conventional “lines of business.”. He is a tragic comedian, or a comic
tragedian as the case may be. ...Not only is his heart in his art, but (and let the
sneering world mark this well), his art is in his heart! A hard saying to
Cockneys, and yet a true one.
joins Remarksmopons Stoºger is an actor first, and then, after due interval
—a man. He scorns the modern school, with its cup-and-saucer quietude an
its drawing-room ease. He hates the mere gentleman actor's tone and morning
dress in good society with the high and holy hatred of the ideal artist of the
stage. His present and future lie in the past. To him tradition holds high
rule over grovelling, prosaic nature. For more than thirty years, he will
tell you with pride, no one has heard him speak in a natural voice. The waiter
who takes his order for dinner, in eating-houses where he is a stranger, shrinks
back, appalled, at his question of when the joint is in the best cut, and trembles
when he alludes to vegetables. A terribly gloomy man, with short hair and a
long black moustache. Partial friends declare that his tragedy is perfectly
awful; and impartial critics insist that his comedy is more awful still. awe-
inspiring, attention-wearying man, and yet a man with a heart worth its
weight in gold and precious stones. Let an appeal be made to him in the
sacred name of charity, and all he asks is that he may have the best part, no
rivals near his throne, and, above all, his name printed at the head of the bill
in letters at least, two feet long. These simple conditions complied with, and
his support is easily secured.
Let us look at this great good man at home. Let us ascend the stairs and
enter his suite of rooms. we will only listen while he rifles his rich store of
anecdotes, we may make sure of a welcome.
A simple, unpretending hall, with tables bearing ormolu clocks, plated
goblets, and, imposing double-silvered coffee-pots. ... Once .TINsei, was a
manager, and these are, the testimonials presented to him by his grateful em-
ployés. That tarnished Tea-set represents, the respect of fifty Ballet Girls
who mulcted themselves for its purchase of five shillings a-piece out of average
weekly salaries of under a pound. That showy pair of Candlesticks is a proof
(at the instigation of the Stage Manager) of the hearty good-will of seven-and-
twenty. º: Carpenters, Gas men, and Supernumeraries. TINSEL may
well prize these testimonials, for there is not one of them that does not repre-
sent a scanty salary made more scanty, and a poor home reduced to greater
poverty, to do him honour.
* A º leads from the hall to the sanctum. In this passage is a might
cupboard full of brown-paper-covered books. These ; are tied up an
addressed to J. K. S. SLoggeB, Esq., at various Theatres Royal. When Siogg|ER
takes his annual tour, pieces pour in upon him by the score and by the
hundred. Sucking SHAKSPEAREs and ::::::: SHERI-
DANs send their choicest works to him, hoping that those
works will be perused, hoping that those works will
carry their authors on to the boards of Drury Lane, and
into the highest niches of the Temple of Fame. Their
end is in SLoggBR's passage cupboard. -
As his visitor enters the sitting-room, SLOGGER rises,
stretches forth his hand with a graceful wave, and bows.
Then he seizes two chairs, by their backs, drags them
forward into the centre of the room, motions to his guest
to seat himself, and produces a set of folio volumes full
of newspaper cuttings. For hours and hours he will
with a kindly defiance of fatigue, read you notices of
his own performances. While he reads, letus look round:
A room full of “properties.” Here a gilt table laid out
with a papier mâché banquet; there an old clock point-
ing for ever to ten minutes past nine. Overyonder a can-
was light-house belonging to a sensation, drama: Chairs
and tables of all styles and periods, and a portion of a
transformation scene. A real cab, and a profile train
shutting up like a telescope. That cab was the saying of
a domestic drama, and yonder train (a “ter-rain,” as
SLoggº pronounces it once made the fortune of a “scene
of real life.”. When SLogg|ER retired from management
he/secured these properties. Some of them are still
useful. In the provinces he occasionally stoops from
SHAKSPEARE to authors of more modern date. When
he does so he sometimes finds it useful to be able, to
supply a clock for the Corsican Brothers, or a light-
house for the Turn of the Tide.
Yes; this is indeed an artist, Ask him what he knows of
his contemporaries, and he will tell you, with that candid
self-absorption which belongs to genius, “Nothing.”.The
ead he praises heartily, because, egotistical as a child,
like all true artists, his world is himself. His "...i he
admits may be like nothing in nature. Why shou ā'it
be It is acting. That the ideal is the goal in his Art,
he informs you with pardonable pride—not the real. His
hope is that the Government will one day awake to a
sense of.its responsibilities to the Drama, and found a
National Theatre, with Tradition at its base and SLOGGER
at its apex. “Then, and not ſtill then,” as he sadly re-
marks, “there will be a hope for the Stage.” “For the
present, Sir,” he adds, “what with this absurd cry for
Nature,” and this gross craving after ‘realism,’ they
have knocked the Art of Acting out of time—either
forced the true Tragedian into the Provinces, or humi-
liated him to the degradation of opening the Pantomime
season at the Lane!”
Look on SLogger with respect. He is the relic of a
great past; the survivin astodon of a generation of
antediluvian Behemoths

MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
UT of º:
Inspire your In-
". º to
the humblest mem-
bers of the Great
Republic of Letters
I am emboldened to
address you on a
subject very near
to my heart. For
many years it has
been myambition to
become a dramatist,
but I have hitherto
lacked º:
tion. ialogue
is toniº by
many most influen-
tial friends, to be
above praise. To
quote one of them
“Good is not the
word for it.” Ibe-
lieve I have struck
upon a vein at last.
Without transla-
ting from the
French, without
rushing to the Cir-
gulating Library,
I think I can get a
framework for my
plots. Recently, a
gentleman of great
to the same source for “the arguments” of my pieces?
I have jotted down a few ideas, and shall be glad to
hear your opinion of them.
Hamlet.-Capital notion for a comedy. Of course
Polonius would pretend to be the ghost of Hamlet's
father. Great fun might be got out of this. Scene in
England in the present day. All the killing naturally
would have to be cut out. Something might be done
with the play-scene-amateur theatricals, you know?
Then end the piece with Gertrude's marriage, and get a
laugh out of the mistake of the pastry-cook in sending
the funeral baked meats for the wedding-breakfast. By
the way, Ophelia's ballads would, of course, have to be
worked into a “topical song” to airs ºf the º:
Othello.-A domestic drama, with a happy ending. Lay
the scene of the piece during the last war, and make the
Moor a nigger. rn Iago into a female character, and
ake him (or rather her). Desdemona's mother-in-law.
he º: situation at the end of the playshould be Othello
unable to get into his house to murder his wife (of course
he should be tipsy at the time), because he can't find the
hole in the lock for his lateh-key. Cassio, Brabantio,
and Roderigo should be worked up into one character.
Merchani of Venice.—Obviously a modern comedy.
The character of Shylock should afford opportunities for
a number of happy hits at the extortionate rate, of
interest charged by West-End usurers. Portia would be-
come a “Woman's Rights” person. Great fun could be
got out of the Court Scene, which should rival the one
in MR. ARTHUR SULLIVAN's operetta, Trial by º: -
The above are merely specimen schemes, and the list
might be extended to almost any length.
Apologising for troubling you, I now lay down my
pen, ...i humbly sign myself.
Yours most sincerely,

BURNS AND MEMNON.
FREQUENTERs of the Qpera have heard, a Statue sing. LoRD
Houghton, on unveiling the Image of the immortal BURNs, which
Glasgow has set up, to the credit of the citizens of that ilk, as well
as the Poet's honour and glory, thus elegantly suggested the possi-
bility of a singing. Statue other than that of the celebrated, Com-
mendatore. He said, referring to the Memorials of deities, heroes,
and tyrants, erected by the people of ancient Egypt:-
“Among the most ancient monuments which attract the traveller in that
country is a colossal figure of a god or hero of the name of MEMNoN, of which
there is a strange and beautiful tradition. It was believed that by some
magical attraction and supernatural sympathy, the rays of the rising sun drew
forth at morning from the inanimate stone sounds of such exquisite music as
charmed and entranced all who had the good fortune to be within the range
of the mortal ear. Now, Gentlemen, I have a fancy that the ardour of your
affections, and the light of your imaginations, might almost draw from this
Statue a song of some hundred years ago—a strain of beauty that might go to
your heart of hearts.”

MONADS AND MASSES.
A Contribution to the Atomic Theory of Politics.
“I may say that in the transactions of the last few years, we, the States-
men—if I may use that term—have learnt as much from the masses of the
neople as the masses of the people have learnt from us.”—SIR STAFFoRD
or THCOTE at Liverpool.
EuBEKA. The look-out ahead is less dense;
There is hope, after all, for the governing classes.
Our Statesmen, in search of some atoms of sense,
Have found, of late years, what they want in the masses.
Remembering Shipping and Slave Trade affairs,
One can hardly deny that SIR STAFFoRD spake truly.
Yet Monads in office will give themselves airs,
And look down on Masses as blind and unruly.
SIR STAFFoRD himself could austerely reprove
When he found Eastern policy did not content 'em,
'Tis plain if the Masses some Monads would move,
It must be by sheer dint of united momentum.

“One of the most intelligent, and probably the best, of naval critics tells
us that no one knows with any degree of thoroughness what use is made of
our Navy, how it is managed, or what it is worth; but, so far as the limited
knowledge of the best informed enables any one to form an opinion, the pro-
bability is that all is wrong. . . . . In MR. REED's vigorous language, “the
ship is a steam-being, and the only man who understands it, can work it with
safety, can control, it efficiently, can use it, care for it, tend it, preserve it,
repair it, renew it, is the Engineer.'. The Engineer, the functions of the
Engineer, and the position of the Engineer, should be held in honour; but,
in fact," he remains to-day almost precisely where he was twenty years ago—
a snubbed, subdued, subordinated man, with a dozen officers put above him
to look down upon him.’”—The Times on MR. REED's Letter about “Naval
Administration.”
So “Nobody knows!" That's remarkably pleasant!
A nice thing to learn at this late time of day !
A sweet game this Naval Blind Hookey! At present
I don't seem to relish my hand in the *: -
Many millions I’ve spent on the modern “Steam-being,”
You don't buy that sort of big toy for a song;
And now 'midst my Critics I find none agreeing,
Except on one point—that all’s probably wrong !
Nobody knows? Well, those precious twin Titans
Have turned topsy-turvy our Naval Affairs;
But are Iron and Steam a malign brace of Sheitans
To empty my purse and to fill me with scares?
All that Steam-beings can do, or can't, in fair fighting,
Perhaps we shan’t learn till the things come to blows.
But are mine trustworthy P It's somewhat affrighting
To find the sole answer is Nobody knows!
Nº. knows! Years ago—about fifty,
My Navy was tested. e found it “all there.”
Since then all is new, and I haven't been thrifty
In paying—since change was the call—for my share.
The new Iron Pot puzzles me, I admit it.
Smart Science shouts “ Prºgress !” . She’s right, I suppose.
But what's the Pot worth, if 'gainst rivals I pit it?
That seems a fair question, but—Nobody knows.
Nobody knows?... Well, here's REED, ex-Constructor,
A smart sort of º: a dab at a yarn;
Would fain through the dense Marine maze play conductor.
IIe knows the “ Steam-being ” from stem unto stern.
He, no doubt, feels that he should be sole supervisor,
With ample and ship-shape Reports year by year,
With a right to take henceforth for Naval Adviser
That much misused being, the Chief Engineer!
“Snubbed, subdued, and subordinate P’’ Well, I’d a notion
The Creature was certainly more cockahoop.
REED paints him as Ought-to-be Lord of the Ocean,
Head-boss of the steam-ship from fok'sle to poop.
He only can handle it, guide it, preserve it,
- Whilst JACK, though a jolly and dauntless sea-do
(Poor JACK sorely snubbed 1–does he really deserve it?)
Is—shades of old Salts l—like a flat in a fog.
Well, they'll want him—to fight—I suspect notwithstanding.
He'll maybe outlast all their huge devil's-gear;
He stablished his status 'neath other commanding
Than that of our Crichton, the Chief Engineer.
But lº. stern; if the new battle's brunt
Must be borne by the handler of pistons and cranks,
Let him come to the fore as a fact we can't shunt,
And receive his reward in pay, honours—and thanks.
Mine I'm sure will be his if he'll º to ºntangle
This horrible muddle called “Naval Affairs; ”
Make peace 'midst the critics who boggle and jangle,
And shut up swell duffers who give themselves airs.
A fleet that's not phantom I claim for my money,
With ships not a terror to me but my foes.
But whenever I ask how I stand, it seems funny
To hear, for sole answer, that “Nobody knows!”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
Hiſ ºxº
Hºa

º/
N his late mission, accounting for
himself.
SIR,--So many people have asked
why I was not at the Conference,
that I feel I must speak out, and own that, though you sent me, I did not go.
No, Sir, I am not one of your Pretenders (by whom you have of late been º
who take your money and write accounts of what mºve took lace. Sir,
meant ; I smoked Turkish pipes, I ate Russian caviare, and, in order to
be thoroughly up in the Great Eastern Question, I bought Great Eastern shares,
about which at the time there was a considerable question. Then I went in for
Circassian Pomade, night and morning, thus pouring oil on the troubled waters,
or rather putting grease—or, what MR. GLADsroNE would call the “Hellenic
Factor”—on my brain. I substituted Kurds for milk at breakfast-time. B
the way, why asn't some enterprising hairdresser invented a pomade, an
called it the "Hellenic Factor,” with a dedication to MR; GLADSTONE * There's
the idea, and no extra charge ? I sent for my true and tried friend, PEggul BEY
(who is now, undergoing the shrimp-gure at a favourite watering-place), and in
order that the Russian interest should be represented equally with the Turkish,
I dropped a line to dear old GENERAL SNEzANUFF KoRFIToff, who has been
laid by the heels ever since November with a severe cold, which has prevented
his seeing anyone—even his creditors, whose attentions during his illness have
been unremitting.
Well, Sir, we three started for the Conference, Poor SNEZANUFF KoRrrrorf
ºº as far as Charing Cross, when he suddenly exclaimed, in Russian,
-- 9] I’ve forgotten my pocket-handkerchief!” and disappeared, with a
seedy-looking individual close at his heels—probably somebody who had found
the missing mouchoir. . PEggui, Bey, who had got a box of shrimps with him,
which he takes like voice-lozenges, bienched at the sight of the sea, turned pale,
and turned tail. He went back to his shrimp-cure, while I boldly stepped on
board the steamer, and gaily bade adieu to the smashed pier of Dover and the
white cliffs of Albion.
On arriving in Paris I received a telegram from my private French
Secretary, who always travels in advance with my things for to-morrow night.
“Encore une bonne Conférenee allé tort.” What could I do? Nothing. I
waited in Paris expecting the return of the handsome SALISBURY: (as we gay
dogs call him to distinguish him from “Salisbury Plain”) who would, of course
take Paris on his way and tell me all about it, is, Sir, is how I came to find
myself in the gay º: where the present “Occupation of Paris” is to go to
the theatres, the weather not permitting much lounging in the Elysian Fields
or promenading up and down the Bulwarks of the Italians. Once more I roare
at the drolleries of the Palais Royal, and admired the ensemble presented by
GIL PéRiºs, HYACINTHE (the immortal, LHáRITIERET CIE., and if at the Bouffes
farisiens f was on the whole º: with Les Trois Margots (musique
de GRISART), yet, at all events, I yielded to the charm of PESCHARD's voice and
manner, and again bore testimony to the excellence of the ensemble which would
have triumphantly carried a far worse piece than Les Trois Margots.
Opéras-bouffes are a French spécialité. But, Sir, I did not waste my time
in trifles light as air, but I went to assist at Un Drame au Fond de la Mer, in
five Acts, six Tableaux, now being played at the Théâtre Historique. A most
exciting play. Sieur Reginald, a paralysed English Baronet, making a voyage
on board the Washington (I think), with two millions-worth of diamonds in a
small box, goes with the wreck, his wife and the box, to the bottom of the sea.
An engineer (James Norton), and an officer of the French Marine, Henry de
Sartène, rivals for the hand of Mees Emily, the orphaned
daughter of Sieur Reginald, quarrel violently on board
the Great Eastern, and both descend, habited as divers,
to look after the cable which has come to grief. They
are accompanied by one Karl, a thorough-paced scoun-
drel, who having ascertained the exact locality of these
diamonds, has determined to possess himself of the two
millions. The scene on board the Great Eastern is ad-
mirably contrived. Then the divers go through nine
changes of tableaux, all capitally managed and most
effective until they arrive at the bottom of the sea. Here
we find Sieur Reginald, his wife, and the crew in a high
state of preservatiºn, looking uncommonly like MADAME
Tussaud's figures, but nonetheless awful on that account.
Aarl makes for the diamonds, Henry de Sartène, one of
the engineers above mentioned, rushes as fast as the
diying dress and helmet will let him, at Karl, who,
seizing a hatchet, cuts Henry de Sartène's wind-pipe,
that is, I mean the air-bag, or whatever it is that gives
the diver the necessary supply of air. A terrific act this,
and down comes the curtain to shouts of applause.
After a º entr’acte, we return, to find ourselves in
England—at least, as the place is not named in the pro-
gramme, I suppose it must be England, because the
first person who walks, on into a dingy; official-looking
room is “unpoliceman,” a stiff, red-whiskered personage,
in a queer sort of helmet, Berlin gloves, and a dark-blue
long-tailed coat of a very ancient pattern. Four other
policemen bring in James Nor-ton, who is accused of the
murder of Henry de Sartène. The evidence, which is
given chiefly by the villain Karl, is dead against the
unfortunate James Nor-tow, whose case is heard in pri-
vate by the Coroner, an elderly gentleman, stern, but
occasionally humorous, with a comic clerk, who gets the
laughs when the Coroner doesn't.
James Norton is committed, and is about to be led off
by the four policemen, when the crowd, which has been
“heard without,” groaning and hooting, is suddenly
admitted (so as to make an effective termination at the
end of the scene, and to bring the Coroner to the front
again, as his t has been getting a trifle flat by this
time), and rushes fiercely towards James Norton, who is
at this moment in imminent danger of being torn from
the four policemen, and subjected to Lynch law. At
this juncture the Coroner, still humorous, though firm
and resolute, pulls from his pocket a sort of conjuror's
black wand, tipped at both ends with ivory (exactly
what RoRERT HoudLN used to have), and bids the surg-
ini, crowd retire “au nom de la los.”
ut the Coroner, having once got into the drama, is
not so easily, got rid of as the mere letting down of a
curtain implies. Not a bit of it. The crowd finds out
that Karl, and not James Norton, is the real murderer,
and out comes "everybody—policemen and all—on the
rocks to catch Karl, and Lynch him.
They are on the point;of seizing the unhappy wretch
by the way, no murder has been committed after all, for
enry turns up safe and sound,-but this is a detail),
and doing for him effectually then and there, when the
humorous Coroner suddenly, but quietly, appears from
behind a rock—where he has apparently been sitting in
evening dress, and without a hat all in the cold, waiting
for this opportunity of coming out strong at the last—
and presents his ivory-tipped wand, whereat the crowd
again quails, and Karl himself is so staggered, that
losing his presence of mind, he runs up a platform at the
back, jumps over, and finishes his part in the drama.
Seeing this termination to the affaire, the Coroner
makes the best of it by taking a humorous view of the
situation, and indulging in a professional joke to the
effect that “º instruction” need not proceed any fur-
ther—for much the same reason that Puff gives for the
Beefeater's not going on with the speech commencing
“Farewell, brave Spaniard,” &c.—because the body has
walked, off. The audience took the idea, and, in spite
of all the spectacle and all the horrors, and all the in-
terest, the triumph of the night was with the Coroner.
After this, oysters of Marennes and other delights at the
Café Riche, and this is why I didn't go to the Con-
ference—but remain
Ever faithfully,
YoURREPRESENTATIVE.

WOMAN'S WORK.
(A Snarl by a Sezagenarian Cynic.)
SoMEBODY-a Woman probably—has, I
am told, been writing a novel entitled, A
Woman's Work in the World. I could sum
it up in less than three volumes. As follows:
In Literature.—At once to emasculate
and to corrupt. To oscillate between gross-
ness and gush. To dribble reams of feebly
trickling verse and insipid or very full-
flavoured fiction. To embody, vice as a
preposterous chimera, and virtue as a
goody-goody bore; passion as a scented
swell, and principle as a plausible prig.
In Art.—To paint pretty-pretty, to com-
pose namby-pamby, and perpetuate the
modish and the monstrous. -
In Science.—To dabble in the dirtiest
waters, to push crude crotchets to absur-
dity, to be amateurs in Atheism and smat-
terers in statistical scepticism.
In Politics.--To discuss upon the house-
tops subjects which men shrink from hand-
lift in private rooms. -
n Religion.--To patronise the Gospel
according to Le Follet, and worship their
pet fetish, La Mode, at a High Church
Altar.
In Society.—To spend money and dis-
figure their persons, patronising all that is
absurd, unbecoming...unhealthy, and ex-
pensive, especially if it involve incidental
cruelty.
At Home.—Women have now no work at
home.
This, I, SYLVESTER, SNARLEYow, main-
tain is a compendious statement of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HARMLESS LUNATICS.
N the Council
of the Charity
Organisation So-
ciety a Special
Committee was
some time ago
appointed to con-
sider and report
upon a parti-
cular branch of
social 'scientific
| improvement,
which may be
styled Colney-
Hatch Reform.
That Committee
has, accordingly,
issued a Report
on the “Education
and Care of Idiots,
Imbeciles, and Harm-
less Lunatics.” Doe-
tors may doubt the
existence of any luna-
ties who are not dan-
gerous; but indeed
the numberoflunatics,
harmless in so far as
that the little harm
they do affects only themselves, is very great. The population of
Lunatic Asylums represents but comparatively few of these harm-
less lunatics. The majority of them are at large, unlooked after,
and they abound. They labour under a great variety of invincible
delusions and fixed ideas. To specify some of the more pro-
nounced types, for instance, the following may be enumerated
amongst tolerably Harmless Lunatics:—
Lunatics who pass their time in trying to discover perpetual
motion, and the quadrature of the circle.
Lunatics continually publishing pamphlets to show that the earth
is flat; but only showing themselves to be so.
Lunatics who devote themselves to tulip fancying, or any other
fancy which occupies their whole minds, crockery fanciers, collectors
of useless objects, worth no more than the effaced postage stamps
collected by young Lunaties. -
Lunatics who believe in and #. Astrology and spirit Rapping
seriously, and not with an intelligent intent to defraud.
Lunatics with a theological craze, who cannot see that their
dogmas are matters of opinion. -
Lunatics who are in the habit of taking quack medicines of whose
composition they are ignorant, and who do not know whether or no
what they suppose to be is really the matter with them.
Lunatics . without the necessary knowledge of what they are
about, gamble on the Stock Exchange and the Turf.
Lunatics who invest their money in risky speculations; who
believe puffing prospectuses of Bubble Companies, and appi for
shares to Directors, and remit cash to them, when they do not know
them not to be rogues. -
Lunatics, of both sexes, who go to evening parties a little before
midnight and dance in a vitiated atmosphere until sunrise. . .
Lunatics who, in these times of high prices, expecting to live in
comfort, and maintain appearances, marry upon less than the cer-
tainty of a thousand a year, and the prospect of indefinitely more.
Lunatics who, when anybody, whose name is unlucky enough to
suggest a self-evident pun, happens to be going the round of the
newspapers, write letters to Mr. Punch, each of them containing
the same pun on the name of the same person. , .
But besides these Lunatics, not contemplated in the Report of the
Charity Organisation Society's Committee, there are others, Lunatics
recognised as such, but perfectly harmless. They are computed to
amount to only 35,963 in England and Wales. These unfortunates
are capable .# being improved in, various degrees, and to some
extent utilised. To these ends they require express treatment
and training; especially separation from poor creatures, similarly
afflicted, whose cases are hopeless. Hence, upon new buildings for
their proper accommodation, a need of outlay. Such expenditure
will ultimately prove economy. The Committee recommend that
the expense for the poorer class of Harmless Lunatics *should
be defrayed out of the rates, with assistance out of the public
revenue,” and that a voluntary system should be adopted for those
of the Middle, and a semi-voluntary one for those of the lower
Middle and upper Artisan Classes. -
The requisite provision for Harmless Lunatics will ask, both
legislation and personal bounty; and those who have a voice in the

The scheme therein particularised will not cost so very much to
garry out... It is not as though it comprised the unrecognised Harm-
less Lunatics fº about in Society. . How many and spacious
Asylums would be necessary to contain these numerous, and,

AN IRISH PROFESSOR IN HIS (BARBER'S) CHAIR.
IRELAND is the Land of Eloquence, where the very “praties,” as
an advertisement in the Irish Times lately informed us,”“speak for
themselves.” Hair-dressing has always been an eloquent profession,
from the days, of the Roman tonsor to those of Figaro. Perhaps
it was in complimentary allusion to this in the Green Isle that the
old Irish way of cutting a head of hair was called a “glib.” Of all
glib-tongued Irish tonsors, Punch does not know that he ever
encountered a glibber specimen than the worthy who, in a handbill
lately sent to Punch by one of this gifted hair-cutter's garrison
customers, describes himself as–
“PROFEssor DANIEL, O'Connelly (late FREDERIck LENEx, New
Market, Sheffield), Hair Dresser and Perfumer, Trans-Atlantic and Cosmo-
§. Clipper, Comber, Brusher, and Dresser to all Fashions for Ladies and
ntlemen.”
The Professor then goes on, enthusiastically if ungrammatically—
“Hair Dressing for its Beauty and Growth, the Professor wishes to see
Horizontal Eyes and perpendicular work, and not to have Hair Cut like the
Bashabazouks, or like as if the Gorilla was operating, but the Gorilla has not
got the Hypocompus Miner. Get Scientific Work that will Refresh the Cer-
rumbellum of the Cranium, and promote its Growth.”
After which earnest exhortation, he signs himself—
Professort O'Connelly, Garrison Hair Dresser,
“Yours, Gentlemen
Edge, in Fine Order for use, at his Residence, Queen
Razors Set, Diamond
Street, Athlone.”
But the Professor, once mounted on the diamond-edge of his own
razor-like wit, cannot so easily get down again. He eontinues—
“The Professor does not like to see Bulsheen Cutting, or what Molly gave
the Cabbage, a good Chopping.”
Then, rising to rhyme—
“But if you wish to have a shave,
I'm sure to make your chin,
As free from every rib of hair,
As any brand new pin.
“For I can curl hair so neat,
And with such cunning hand
You'd really think the head was one
Quite fresh from fairy land.
“And I can frizzle, shringle, prune,
And do so with such art;
That but to gaze upon my work
Would gladden any heart.”
“And if you want to have a dye,
You won't have much delay,
I'll make your head as handsome
As the Turtlue Bird in May.
As it evidently does gladden his heart, who, for the third and last
time, signs himself—
“Yours, Gentlemen, PRofessor O'Connelly, Hair Dresser to the
Students of the Queen's College.”
We thank PROFESSOR Connelly for his additions at once to the
English Fauna and the technical vocabulary of Ploeocosmology.

| AN APPEAL FOR THE ALPHABET.
(From an Alarmed Conservative.)
“It is unfortunate that a language with such power and
prospects as the English should have so disordered an Alphabet,
which has been thrown into utter confusion by the attempt to
keep up. English and French spelling in it at once. At present
two º: of English-speaking children come up for educa-
tion annually, and waste from one to two years of their educa-
tional life in mastering this absurd puzzle, the cost of main-
taining which canthus hardly beless than ten to twenty millions
sterling a year, which would be saved by the use of a rational
Alphabet.”—E. B. TYLoR, on the Philosophy of Speech.
REFoRM our English Alphabet P Good lackl
What won't these revolutionists attack?
I fondly fancied that the A. B. C.
Was the fixed 3. of simplicity.
The onething changeless, certain, strong, and stable,
Midst Innovation's universal Babel.
Here TYLoR comes that A. B. C. to shake,
And prove our spelling one immense mistake.
What next may happen who'll oblige by telling,
When Mutability shakes MAvon's spelling P
And who could slumber calmly in his bed,
The alphabet upset from A. to Z. P
“Ages of time and millions of money
Wasted in learning A. B. C.?” That’s funny.
Can't say I quite accept the statement yet:
| And as regards a “rational alphabet,”—
| Something, no doubt, new-fangled and phonetic, -
My º; I proclaim antipathetic.
I always do suspect that low word “rational; ”
It smacks of BRADLAUGH and the International.
This comes of Spelling Bees, and PITMAN's views,
Cheap Dictionaries, and Fonetic Nuz.
Our forefathers were less fastidious. Why,
If MARLBorough spelt wildly, may not I?
The Rads are all for liberty. Their fad
Applied to spelling, might not be so bad.
But here º 'd bind us down to strictest rule:
Lawless in Church, they’re martinets at School.
Against this E. B. TYLoR's sly attack
Let all Conservatives stand back to back,
And fight for our time-honoured A. B. C.—
I’m very sure it's good enough for me.
|RITUALIST HEAD-QUARTERs.-Peter-sham.
HANGINGS FOR HOSPITALS.
MR, PUNCH has to notify and very much applaud a proposal for
practising a peculiar variety of that species of charity which consists
in clothing the naked—the naked in this case being the walls of
the London Hospital wards. . By clothing them the sick and suffer-
ing would be solaced. The dreariness of bare walls aggravates the
tediousness of long detention on a bed of pain. MR. J. LAw-
RENCE HAMILTON, of 4, Gloucester Terrace, Hyde Park, suggests
that this might be much mitigated by the introduction of decorative
Art in Hospitals.
“I advocate (he says) the brightening of the wards, and the cheering of
their inmates, by the addition of suitable pictures, plates, bronzes, carvings,
parquet floors, bric-d-brae, old armour, china, sculpture, ornamental clocks,
fancy glass, tasteſul glazed tiles, and other Art decorations of all sorts.”
It would be too much of a good thing to hang the walls of Hospi-
tals with arras figured with—
“. . . . huntsmen, hawkes, and houndis,
And hart deere alful of woundis.”
Particularly as the tapestry would harbour the Norfolk Howards.
MR. BUCKLAND fears that any projecting decorations on the walls
of Hospitals would be objectionable, as likely to lodge dirt, or some
of its even more unpleasant living accompaniments. He proposes to
substitute for them pictures painted upon or let into the walls—
frescoes, or tiles, adorned with encaustic paintings, which could be
executed by Ladies.
“To promote this object (says MR. HAMILTON), I will give one hundred
guineas, provided that a thousand other donors each subscribes an equal or
larger sum before the 1st of May, 1877.”
MR. HAMILTON believes that, a responsible Committee being
formed, to carry out his idea, MEssRs. RobARTs, LURRock, & Co.,
will act as bankers to the fund. In the meanwhile, he invites
persons disposed to contribute thereunto by subscription or donation
to communicate with himself at the address above noted. Finally,
-- --
h sses the hope that some public place will soon “be granted
*: j. º: and exhibition for Art contributions pre-
vious to their distribution to the Hospitals, of London.” To that
hope iſr. Punch gladly gives all the publicity he can.
Why Some of Us go Circuit.

this time? Hum. Let me see. “Muddeford”—can get a day's

wouldn't do any harm to go and look up UNCLE GEORGE. “Lea-
mouth”—excellent quarters at hotel there; , fair dinner, too.
“Deddingham.”—good murder case ; shouldn’t like to miss it.
Yes, I think I’ll go round as far as that, and get back to Town in
time for the Boat-race.”
Too Bad.

SATISFACTORY to be able to open Parliament in person. The cream-coloured horses, State-Coach (re-gilt
and newly fitted up), Life-Guards, Beefeaters, and Cap of Maintenance, material supports to the ºiſ.
of a Constitutional Monarchy.
Observe that the time of meeting was appointed for a day in February as late as could with decency
be chosen. Trust, therefore, particularly as Easter falls early, that time will not be wasted in unprofitable
discussions and unproductive Motions.
Parliament shall be informed as soon as possible when the Easter recess will commence, and what will
be its duration—a question of absorbing interest on which it is gratifying to know that perfect unanimity
of feeling exists.
Foreign affairs, and, towering above everything else, the giant Eastern Question, will occupy your
attention. Treat it with as much patriotic and as little party spirit as possible—openly and straight-
forwardly, without bravado, mystery, or circumlocution, and with no reference to the retention or
acquisition of place and power.
. The début of the EARL of BEAconsfield and the return of the MARQUIs of SALISBURY will impart more
interest to theWºji of the House of Lords than they ordinarily command at the commencement of
the Session. e shall all (including the Chinese Embassy and the Artists for the Illustrated Newspapers)
await the first appearance of the noble Earl, in the robes of a Peer, with the liveliest curiosity. Mr. Punch
#. .a hint from those rival conjurors, the GIRARDs, for a picture of LoRD B.'s first appearance on
ls new stage.
... The House of Commons will have a new Leader in SIR STAFFORD Northcote. It will be no surprise
if he acquits himself in that onerous and responsible position with credit and renown. He will need
encouragement and support; for as CHANCELLOR of THE Exchequer, his task is too likely to be difficult
and disagreeable. It is unfortunate that a Conservative Government and a cheerful balance-sheet can
hardly be looked upon as co-existent possibilities.
..With regard to Legislative Measures, if you cannot advance, do not retrograde; if you cannot go on
building, do not pull down. If it is the opinion of the majority that political and educational legislation
has been carried to the limits of safety, turn your attention to Social and Sanitary Improvements, and
thereby better the health and increase the comfort and happiness of millions:
If it is possible, prove to the country that it possesses a satisfactory Naval and Military force.
Reduce the risk of Railway Accidents, and abate the disaster of destructive floods.
Pass a Burials Bill. Make more stringent regulations as to Vaccination.
Do not countenance jobs or favouritism.
The EMPRESS OF INDIA invites you to consider questions affecting that empire with greater earnestness
and larger attendances.
If you find yourselves hesi-
tating between your dinner
and your country, give your
country the benefit of the
doubt.
Rein in your hobbies, forego
your crotchets, suppress your
grievances, guard against
personalities, "do not invest
trifles with too much import-
ance, and above all watch the
clock.
Let us all hope that this
“Conference” on the banks
of the Thames will have a
happier issue than the one so
recently concluded on the
shores of the Bosphorus.
THE RIGHT WOMAN IN

a well-known daily paper—

for unlimited loo and the turf,

who, on the strength of pos-
sessing a large inkstand, plenty

writing three-volume novels.
Miss GUssy GABY, who
persists in sending to “her

which her darling HUGH said

of placing before an appreciative Public Works of
Fiction, which, but for this machinery, would never have
seen the light of day. - - -
Without binding ourselves by the strict obligations of
this enterprising Company, which deserves every pos-
sible encouragement—the shares are quoted at three
premium, at least we hear of one share quoted at this,
and it is yet to be had at the price, and perhaps more
where that comes, from-without we say, in any way
binding ourselves (an operation we leave to professional
hands when the yearly volume is put together-and
then the binding is de lure) by unnecessary obligations
we have liberally and heartily entered into the spirit of
the thing, and, on certain %. and just terms, have
consented to place at the Company's disposal one page
per week as a shop-front for the display of their wares,
reserving, however, to ourselves, the indisputable right
of using our pruning-knife and scissors when and where
we please, even to c #. the shoot in its first sprout,
cutting the thread of the heroine's fate with the scissors
of The Three Sisters, or breaking, as with the force.of
steam and iron, some monstrous Atlantic cable of fiction
as it is being paid out (of the Company's pocket) at so
much a week.
Such is our contract. We praise the object of the Com-
pany, but we stand as Middleman, between the Company
and the Public; we advise on the one hand, we protecton
the other.
We are:glad, therefore, to be able to state, that,
yielding to our solicitations, and recognising the yalue of
our experience (experience is to be bought—and we sell
it), the Company has not commenced operations b placing
before the public the works of the “Mute Inglorious,
but of the Outspoken and Glorious—that is, such works
of fiction as some of our eminent inen whether engaged
in the arena of politics, or in the fields of science, or in
the Marble Élſºof our Law Courts, have, from time to
time, written at their leisure, in the privacy of their
cabinet, in the snuggery of their couch, not originally
intended for publication, but perhaps meant, at some
time or other tº: perhaps) to startle the world
into the exclamation,"What a man he was!!”
The only condition on which we receive works from
eminent public men, and publish them in these columns,
must here, once and for all, be distinctly understood,
and it is this:–
prove that you, MR. MüDGoLD, have no sort of right to this property. That

R. PUNCH,
SHIVER my timbers, and
brace up my old main yards to
the wind, if I can hold myſtongue a
day longer. We have had too much of
your land-lubberly yarns about Dock-
*: What do you mean
y it, Sir P Knock me
down with a marling-spike
if I put up with it. “En-
#. and Superinten-
ents of our Dockyards at
loggerheads.” And what
if they are, Sir? What if
they are P. The Service

with a vengeance if a
Naval Officer isn't to be
trusted to keep a pack of
civilians in their places !
Bombshells and hand-
grenades! I never heard
the like of it since I was a
Middy in 1825 ! Never,
Sir, never!
Have you read the letter
of my friend WICE-ADMIRAL
HALL in the Times of the 1st? If you have not, Sir, read it, and
you’ll learn that the holes cut in the water-tight bulkheads of the
Vanguard were only very little ones . There, Sir, is an answer tº
your nonsense about Naval Maladministration, Pºoh, Sir, nonsense!
The Vanguard was lost, Sir, (as my friend the WICE-ADMIRAL
says), because it was an old tea-kettle. That was the reason, Sir.
To say that a few holes of six inches width cut in the bulk-heads of a
ship of 6,000 tons could sink her, is, on the face of it, sheer nonsense!
Rubbish, Sir, rubbish! My friend, WICE-ADMIRAL iłº, has proved
that an Admiral must know about everything from end to end of a
ship, engines and all, far better than any one else. Of course he
must. You are evidently no more able to appreciate, the real
capabilities of a naval officer than the rest of your lubberly; shºre-
going, quill-driving sons of purser's clerks, who reel off their
slack-jaw in the newspapers. -
Lord PALMERston said that “when he wanted a thing done he
always sent for a sailor.” . As my friend WICE-ADMIRAL says,
“in the face of this recorded opinion of a great Statesman, we can
afford to bear the comments of our detractors.” So heave a-head,

Dockyard Maladministration if you please.

AIR-‘‘A Highland Lad my Love was born.”
“We have to announce the landing at Southampton, (Saturday, January 27), of Quoh-Sung-Tao, the first Chinese Envoy ever accredited to this country,
and suite.”—Shipping Intelligence.
A CHINAMAN QUoB-SUNG was born,
The “Foreign Devils” he held in scorn;
But some time ago those “Devils” began
To tread on the toes of John Chinaman.
So like it or no, John Chinaman,
You have got to go, John Chinaman,
To the land of the “Outer-barba-ri-an,”
An Ambassador, though, John Chinaman!
With his eyes aslant, and his pigtail's braid
Coiled neatly round his close-shaved head,
And his button a-top, Southampton ran
To behold this great Panjandern !
And if QUOH-SUNG is scarce so fine a man
As we hoped for the sample Chinaman,
How many big things from as little began
As this Embassy from John Chinaman!
As stubborn as º: and as hard to steer,
With a taste for cheap buying and selling"dear;

A decidedly difficult sort of man
To deal with, we've found John Chinaman.
His own way he’ll gol, will John Chinaman;
At no lie he’ll shy, will John Chinaman;
And he’ll sell you a bargain whenever he can,
In treaties or teas, will John Chinamanl
You may talk of your Yankee and Hebrew Jew,
But I guess they're small potatoes, and few
In a hill, compared with that yellow man,
After yellow oys keen, John Chinaman.
He'll outdo our doos will John Chinaman;
And he'll win where we lose, will John Chinaman;
The dirt our miners have left he'll “pan,”
And make it pay, will John Chinaman!
If all this he has learnt without leaving home,
What will it be now that he deigns to roam,
And from civilised Christians learns to plan
New dodges undreamed by John Chinaman?

LYMPH FROM THE FOUNTAIN.
It may seem announcing a truism to say that there is nothing like
going for lymph to the fountain-head. But the lymph being under-
stood to be vaccine, and the source of it the calf, º the fact being that
#º obtained from unhealthy human beings may possibly infect
ose vaccinated with something worse than cow-pox, the point of
procuring yaccine lymph from the fountain is perceived to be one of
which the importance requires it to be urged, so long as it remains
neglected. Thanks are due to DR. GEORGE WYLD, M.D., for point-
ing out that in Belgium the Government, which makes Vaccination
compulsory, also provides for lymph supply direct from the calf,
and suggesting that the British Public, should call upon our Legis-
lature to do likewise; In the meanwhile, DR. WYLD mentions that
some medical men, backed by one of the City vestries, are making
arrangements to provide a supply of lymph immediately from calves,
and that “MR. ALLshokNE, 51, Edgware Road, will endeavour to
keep a limited supply of Belgian calf lymph for the use of the
Medical Profession.’
Of course the Anti-Waccinationists will object to Vaccination even
if performed with lymph extracted from calves. That the calves
may yield the lymph they have to be kept in a state of disorder, to
which their fellow-greatures of Keighley, for instance, might have a
sympathetic objection... No Anti-Vaccinationist, however, could
possibly ever find himself vaccinated except by stratagem. Neither
could recourse be had to Ritualists, or any other of the numerous
biped calves that now abound, for original yaccine matter. . But
perhaps were any one vaccinated with lymph derived from suchlike
galves, the possibility that some vituline taint might be imparted by
it to that person's blood might become a question for the Faculty.

JOHN PARRY'S FAREWELL,
AT four o'clock this Wednesday, February 7th, after
the performance of The Critic, which commences at 2:15,
our dear old friend, John PARRY, the most entertaining
of all entertainers, comes forward on the stage of the
Gaiety Theatre to “recall reminiscences of bygone days
under the title of Echoes of the Past.” One of his
reminiscences is to be The Tenor and the Tin Tack. Let
those who see this notice, and who have left their
chance of getting a seat for the Farewell Performance to
the last moment, rush down, or º: at once, to
the Box-office of the theatre, for The Tenor and the Tin
Tack may not be given again, and those who lose this
great opportunity will never cease to reproach themselves
for their neglect. But whether it be John PARRY in The
Tenor and the Tin Tack, or in La Lezione di Canto, or
an Qperatic Rehearsal, we, in our time; shall, in all pro-
bability, never hear or look upon his like again—that is,
in his peculiar line, d la mode de PARRY.
NEW FACTS AND OLD FABLES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
IN. spite of the dictum of RoussBAU, the fable or apologue,
based upon the characteristics of the animal kingdom, has been
generally considered one of the most valuable aids in the instruction
of youth. But really, Sir, the animal kingdom—I use the term
- .*.*.* of late been so turned topsy-turvy by scientific
explorers and theorists, that there would seem to be urgent need
for a revised Aſsop, and a remodelled DR, WATTs, I really think
that writers and lecturers ºf: to be more careful in their revela-
tions, and count the cost of introducing complete chaos into the
ancient and honourable realm of Fable. Conceive the condition
of a parent, guardian, or instructor, emphasising moral counsel of the
most irreproachable sort by time-honoured references to the ant and
the bee, and being pulled up short by some sharp child well-posted
in the latest investigations of LUBBock. It would be disconcerting,
not to say demoralising. . SIR John has already done his best to
demolish the reputation of the bee as the moral exemplar to man-
kind. He is now as laboriously undermining the ethical character
of the ant. I want to know what is to become of our Fables if this
sort of thing is to go on ? With what shall we point our copybook
morals, and how shall we adorn our nursery tales? The fresh facts
—if facts they be—furnished by LUBBock, scarcely lend themselves
to the old treatment. How doth the little busy bee? Well, not
entirely in such sort that one could say to a child, without careful
qualification, “Gothou and do likewise!” DICKENs was dreadfully
severe upon the bee. , But then he was only a wild and ribald
humorist. The cold and deliberate attacks of LUBBock are far more
dangerous to the exemplary insect's moral prestige. Shallwecontinue
to bid the sluggard consider formig practice and polity with a view
to imitation? SIR John declares that some ants are industrious, but
others exceedingly idle, too lazy, indeed, to feed or clean themselves
and entirely dependent on slaves. Lazy! uncleanly! and tyrannical
Are these the qualities and practices as a bright example of which
we are to set the ant before our erring youth
would earnestly ask SIR John whether any problematical
benefit to be derived from his patient, and, as it seems to me, un-
pleasant prying into, the penetralia, of hives and ant-hills can
compensate for the shock which will be sustained by our whole
system of moral teaching by apologue, if his unwelcome revelations
become widely credited.
“The Lion is the King of Beasts;
He noble is, and strong!”
How often have I thrilled over that º in the days of my
childhood. I can hardly realise to myself the shock it would have
caused my youthful enthusiasm if any one had assured me—as
they tell us now—that the Lion, the Lion of ANDROCLES, of the
British Standard, of a thousand moving tales and awe-inspiring
figures, is but, a cat-like creature, and, in fact, Yery much of a
coward | Well, the herald has his cºnventionai menagerie of
abnormal birds, amazing beasts, and apocryphal fishes—can they
not leave us, for the invaluable purposes of the moral apologue, the
Conventional Lion, the Conventional Bee, and the Conventional Ant?

PUNCH*S VALENTINES.
º º
ºf ALF-Love is the love
º of youth, but golden
calf-love is the love of
riper reason and ma;
turer years. The world
is no longer young,
though in the golden
age—the age when the
golden calf is worship-
ped among the British
as it once was among
the Israelites. If our
motto is still “Hearts
and Hearts,” it means
that hearts must now
- ... belaidhold of by hands
with something in them. So no wonder
the fashion for substituting gifts for
verses on Valentine's Day should be
spreading more and more. Punch, ever
in the fashion, and ever ready to oblige
a grateful public, begs to suggest a few
appropriate presents for certain eminent
personages:-
Mr. Gladstone,—A packet of stamped
envelopes, with the legend, “To be used
instead of post-cards.”
Lord Beaconsfield.—A model of the
º in black marble, with the fable
of the Frog who tried to be bigger than
the Bull. -
Lord Salisbury.—A Cook's Excursion
ticket, with the inscription, “Great Re-
duction in Railway Travelling.”
*Sir Stafford Northcote.—A set of
DIsaakir’s Novels, “from the Author,”
with the inscription, “Imitation is the
- singerest flattery.—BEAconspirº.
Lord Hartinaton.—An amusin; puzzle game, called “Liberal Policy,” with a card “With
MR. GLApston E's kindest regards.”.
Mr. Gathorne Hardy.—A Treatise on Sewage; with a return of the number of cases of
typhoid fever in the War-Office. -
Mr. Ward Hunt.—An Essay on “The Tea-Kettle in general, and the Vanguard in
particular,” by ADMIRAL STR KING,HALL.
Midhat Pasha.--A Sack, inscribed “The Turkish Constitution—Article 113.” -
The Emperor of Russia.-A Reyersible Coat, with the motto, “Can be turned back again.”
The Emperor of Austria-A Lion's Skin, with an inscription, “The same old game.”—
SHARSPEARE. (King John). -
Prince Von Bismarck.-A box of drastic Pills, with the motto, “Non bis dat qui cità dat.”
The Sultan of Turkey.—A copy of The Road to Ruin, and the song, “Softly tread, 'tis
hollow ground.” -
The # ###.* Fra Diavolo suit, with the motto, “Honour before Honesty.”
Marshal McMahon.—A Franco-German Dictionary, inscribed, “For a good boy, to be
thoroughly mastered.”
Uncle Sam.—A moral Tale, altered from The Looking-Glass, and entitled One Head is
better than Two.
And, lastly, Mr. Punch. — A steam-
yacht, a, grand-tier box for Covent Garden
for life, a coach-and-four, a casket of the
most costly jewellery, a blank chequesigned
“Rothschild,” and a family mansion in
South Kensington, with furniture complete;
aii marked with the Punch monogram, an
inscribed with the Punch motto, "Modesty
is the best policy.”
WONDERS OF THE DAY.
(A Reminiscence of an Installation.)
LookINg back at my own career, wonder
if wonders will ever cease?
Wonder whether a better style of drapery
might not be devised for Peers? -
Wonder how SALISBURY likes having me
at his elbow P
Wonder whether a man is liable to be
tried by his Peers in the House of Lords,
as well as a Court of Justice? - -
Wonder whether they will miss me in
the Commons?
Wonder how NoHTHCOTE will work as a
Leader?
Wonder who will answer GLADSTONEP
Wonder who will walk a-top, of Low E:
Wonder what the Golos will say on the
subject? -
onder whether BIsMARCK will think
anything about it, and what?
Wonder whether I shall be moved to
write a sequel to Irion in Heaven &
Wonder what I really looked forward
to when I wrote Vivian Grey.
Wonder if I could remember half a
dozen lines of The Revolutionary Epic 2
Wonder how the Great Commoner felt
after his rise from PITT to CHATHAM?
Wonder if a Coronet is, after all, a more
dignified head-gear than a wide-awake?
onder what the Comic scribblers will
do without “DIzzy” ”
Wonder if I shall be a hit in my new
part
Wonder if there's still such a thing as
being “kicked up-stairs” —as there cer-
tainly was in PULTENEY's time?
ASSES ON TWO LEGS.
A BIPED ass, called DoNovaN–rough, as
asses are in winter—lately received from
MR. KNox the well-deserved sentence of
two months' imprisonment for striking one
of the servants of the Chinese Ambassador,
whose lives, it seems, are made a burden
to them by the coarsecuriosity, rising some-
times to horse-, or rather ass-, play, of the
London street-roughs, cads, and snobs, who
gather for the purpose abºut the #mbassy
in Portland Place. May all asses who pass
the line that separates braying from kick-
ing, like this DoNovaN, meet with as hard
knocks in the police-court! Do we want
to justify the Chinese in the title they have
iven us of “outer” or “utter barbarians?”
finot, we are bound to receive our Celestial
visitors with the courtesies due to “angels'
visits, few and far between.”

PEN Session! (Thursday, February 8th.) In Queen's wea-
ther, and the QUEEN’s presence. “The Members are met—a
terrible show!” The RIGHT Hon. BENJAMIN DISRAELI,
Wiscount HUGHENDEN AND EARL of BEAconsPIELD, “ob-
served of all observers,” has appeared, between his sponsors,
the EARLs of DERBY AND BRADFord; has served his writ
on the LoRD CHANCELLOR; has duly taken the Oaths, and
walked round the House, as a prize-fighter walks round

on the left of Her Most Gracious MAJESTY, while the LoRD
CHANCELLoR read the sp. which her Ministers have been
pleased to put into her Royal mouth.
If “speech is silvern,” what should a Queen's Speech be?

“Leaden,” if we may take this year's concatenation of dull nar-
ratiye and puny promise as a sample. . It tells all in the history
of the, Turkish troubles that everybody knew already, omitting
everything everybody wanted to know, and leaving us equally in
the dark on the really important point what we are going to do
next. It dashes the announcement of the assumption of the Im-
perial_title at Delhi with the grim tidings of famine in Bombay
and Madras (but, strange to say, not a word of the cyclone); gives
a regret to the troubles in the Transvaal, and promises—
For England—Bills for Reform in the Universities, the Law of
Bankruptcy and Patents, Prisons, and Property Valuation, Factories,
Workshops, and Summary Jurisdiction of Magistrates.
For Scotland—Legislation about Roads and Bridges, and Poor'Law.
For Ireland—Bills for Establishing one Supreme Court of Judica-
ture, and giving the County Courts an Equitable Jurisdiction.
Bt voilà tout! -
Let Punch call in the ghost of his old friend, SAMUEL PEPys,
to condense the Essence of the evening.
“Then Lords and Commons to debating on the Address. But,
Lord! to see how blindly they did all talk, for lack of the papers
whereof 1,200 folio pages be only this day distributed to Members o
both Houses, for such digestion as they can give them. Mighty
pr to note how in both Houses the Speakers for the Government
and the Opposition did shoot in each other's faces—the one clearly
proving how they have all, along used, one language and kept one
policy, the other as plainly showing how they have contradicted
themselves flat in the one, and gone right round in the other. . . . ;
And each to the satisfaction of his own side. . . . . So no marvel
nothing like to come of it all but nothing.
“Only both sides do agree that my LoRD SALISBURY hath borne
himself bravely, and said and done exactly what both the Ministers
and the Opposition would have had him do. As though a man
should blow hot and cold at once. Which puzzles me. And my
LoRD DURE OF ARGYLL did speak mighty hotly, and gave their Lord-
ships his mind like a spirited gentleman as he is, and of a ruddy
colour, and peppery, and was for making the Grand Turk do what we
would have him, and taking him by the throat, if it came to the worst,
whereat my LoRD DERBy did seem troubled, being of a mind that it
is better for all, and most for the Christian subjects of the Turk, to
open their eyes and shut their mouths, and see what Time or Mus-
covite will send them, which, methinks, is a course, like to be more
to the mind of my LoRD DERBY, and us in this island, than the Chris-
tians now so grievously ill-handed and misruled by the Graná Turk;
“Pretty to see how marvellous modest my LoRD BEAconsEIELD did
bear himself, and how soft-spoken he was in his new place. And
methinks, he did wear his robes of Earl as easy as ever I saw and
not unhandsomely, as do some that were born, to them. And m
LoRD HARTINGTON, in the Commons' House, did speak with a thic
voice, but to the point, showing how that when the Envoys came to
Conference at Constantinople, it was not only to ask the Grand Turk
for Reforms, but to have the same Reforms, with the Turk's will or
against it. And methinks my Lord would have England join with
the Muscovite to press the Grand Turk home, rather than leave him
altogether in the hands of the Muscovite—and therein methinks my
Lord spoke wisely as well as boldly. But to see how the new
Leader of the House was sore hampered, and would read from
papers which were not yet before Members, and how MR. GLADSTONE
chid him sharply for it, but himself afterwards spoke mighty well,
and maintained all that the people in their meetings last autumn
had given voice to, and all he had himself said and written against
the Grand Turk and his ill-doings. Yet, for all this, could I not
clearly learn what they of the Opposition would do to make the Turk
do better, but hope they would do somewhat, though the Government
do seem plainly of no mind, but the mind to do nothing:, .
“And so I home, marvellous weary of their much talking, and no
wiser than I was before, which vexed me.”

namº), the irrepressible Doctor had a rap at Dartmoor, d propos of
the “unfortunate nobleman.”
MR. HARDY reintroduces his University Bills—changed into a
double-headed Parliamentary Nightingale, including both Cambridge
and Oxford in the body of one Statute.
Sixty Bills brought in by private Members!, Hurrah! What
nights we shall be having !. Almost all the hobbies must be trotted
out by this time, one would think,
“OR OTHERWISE.”
WE are often told that the º of the Law is the perfection of
Reason ; but Law has not always the benefit of a humbler
light—the Light of Common Sense. We are glad to see it has been
guided. by this light to its judgment in the appeal against the
conviction of DR. Monck, detected in playing Spiritualist conjuring
tricks at Huddersfield. -
The Wagrant Act, under which he was cºnvicted; enumerates,
among the impostures it is aimed at, tricks performed “by palmistry
or otherwise.” . It was coolly contended, on DR. Monck's behalf,
that the word “or otherwise” must mean something of the same
kind as }. and so did not include the tricks of impostors
calling themselves Spiritualists.
Justices CLEAsby and Pollock, with Common Sense as assessor
for the occasion, held—tout au contraire—that “otherwise’ means
“otherwise,” i.e. tricks different from palmistry, and not of the
same kind, and so affirmed the conviction, which leaves the soi-disant
DR. Monck to work out his term of durance as a rogue and
vagabond.
MR. PUNCH's CÉLÉBRITÉs CHEZ ELLES.
No. W.-DR, HARVEY D'Oyley, AT THE WEST-END.
CoNVENIENTLY situated near the Parks and most fashionable
Squares of the West-End, almost in sight of the Marble Arch, and
not too far from Marlborough House, stands a palatial residence
which combines the appliances of the laboratory with the luxury of
a modern English home. Intelligent foreigners passing by this
red-brick mansion in the Queen Anne style, with its plate-glass
windows, its tall portals and quaint brazen knockers, its well-worn
door-steps, and clustering piles of moulded chimneys, would imagine
that its owner was a duke at least. Not so. This palatial residence
is the property of a man who for many hours daily wrestles with
Death and beats off disease, while in the dark hours he burns the
midnight oil in tracking Science through her tortuous windings, and
makes, at least, twenty thousand a year in guinea fees alone. Its
occupant is the most fashionable consulting physician of the day.
The value of HARVEY D'Oyley's time is measured in gold—his
every five minutes, are guineas. These are swept in by the
never-ending flood of his daily consultations. Then, in the night-
season, so precious are his thoughts, that a secretary is always
seated at, his bedside, to jot down, in shorthand, what, he says
in his sleep. All the principal hospitals (of which he is an
honoured officer) are connected with his house by telegraphic wires,
along which he flashes his medical oracles. The horses in his stables
are selected for their bone, bottom, and speed. When a case of
moment is on hand, when a Cabinet Minister has toothache, or the
wife of an Archbishop is suffering from cold, it is a sight to see the
Doctor's º: brougham, with its thoroughbred step-
pers, flashing through the crowded thoroughfares. The moment one
of D'Oyley's horses gets past his work, that is, ceases to be up to
twenty miles an hour, it is sold, and replaced by another. The
discarded gallopers are usually purchased by CAPTAIN SHAw to
horse the engines of the Fire Brigade.
Before describing the house in detail, it is as well to say that the
domestic offices are defective. The pantry would be more cheerful
for another window, and the Butler has no room, in which he can
receive his comme il faut friends en petit comité. On the right-
hand doorpest are two bells, one labelled “Visitors,” the other
“Servants.” Let us check a natural inclination, and ring the first.
After a pause of a few minutes, the door is opened by a formidable,
almost repellent, person clad in sober black. This is the Doctor's
“confidential man,” but his name is a misnomer. He is the very
reverse of confidential. Ask him to whom that wide-awake on the
hall-slab belongs, and he will require to know your business.
Question him about last night's menu, and he will feign ignorance
of the fact that his master yesterday gaye a large and distinguished
dinner-party. But while you have held him in talk, you are ill
fitted indeed for your vocation, or you will have found time to note
that there is in the corner near the door a handsome hat-stand, sup-
porting many curious walking-sticks, and costly umbrellas... You
will have caught a glimpse of the solid mahogany door leading to
the waiting-room, and the green baize portal of the sanctum
of Hygeia. You will have rapidly written on the tablets of your
memory that the floor is covered with marble-patterned oil-cloth.
Nay, more, before the door is closed in yourface with scant courtesy
you will have made your own the important fact that a stained
glass lamp is hanging from the central star of the stuccº ceiling.
Fortunately, there are means for gaining admittance here besides
a sop to Cerberus. Coals must be carried, and a footman's livery is
a disguise not difficult to assume. Moreover, the Healer, absorbed
in science and consultations, does not know one servant from
another.
Entrance once secured, our survey may be more leisurely. We
enter the waiting-room on the right from the hall. It is cosy
though scarce (from an upholsterer's point of view) costly. A ré
carpet with yellow flowers, gives a decided relief to a blue wall-
paper and a pale green ceiling. The chairs have oak frames and
are leather-seated and backed. The table (a very good one, from
the celebrated emporium of MESSRs. WAMP AND WENEER) is covered
with º comic and serious, literary and social, from
Bradshaw downwards, of various dates and much thumbed. An
illustrated edition of Joe Miller lies side by side with BURRE's
Peerage;...like two roses on one stalk. . Mixed up with the
lighter iiterature are several pamphlets by the Healer himself.
Here, for instance, is D'Oyley on the Circulating Fluid, a most
valuable addition to medical specialism ; and yonder, in a neat
cover, is that standard work of D'Oyley's on the Obscurer Dis-
eases of the Upper. Ten Thousand, for the Doctor belongs to the
new school, and eschews Latin words when English will serve as
well. Seated on the chairs round the table, or ranged along the
walls, or standing in groups, are the patients—for whose amusement
all this literature is inten ed-pale-faced, wearied, and anxious.
Do not let us wait to be summoned into the Healer’s presence, but
by virtue of our “Open, sesame 1” enter his sanctum at once.
A majestic room, hung with roof-prints of eminent Doctors, (from
HUNTER and Port downwards), with well-filled dwarf book-cases;
on their tops, and on stands and small tables all about, models of
preparations under glass-cases, and chemical apparatus. The Healer
is a great authority on the diagnostic power of medical chemistry,
and his brochure on the white blood-corpuscles has attracted great
attention in the columns of the Medical Press. Near the fire, and
well-screened from the draught, are a desk and a very easy chair.
And now let us look at the Healer at work. A delicate-looking
man of sixty, with auburn hair, and a * black, silky moustache.
A grand head, full of bumps that would drive a phrenologist into
ecstacies of delirious delight. A pair of piercing eyes, sparkling
with a concentration of energy and enthusiasm, fun and science. A
well-knit frame of great muscular power. He softly smiles as you
enter, and motions you to a seat. A few rapid questions are first
given, and the answers pondered noted, resolved. Then he examines
you. . He punches you here, bangs you there, and, so to speak,
W. you all over. “Does this hurt?” he asks with each blow,
and notes down in a large book which lies open before your
loudly-uttered answer. In five minutes he has knocked off your
case, and after a hurriedly-written prescription, and perhaps a
rapid interchange of thought on the current topic of the day, with
a recommendation of a mutton-chop luncheon, and the avoidance of
sugar and malt liquors (the Healer has a firm belief in diet, which
he calls the right hand of medicine, and mutton-chops are just

now up, sugar and malt down, in the medical barometer),
and your interview is over... You bow yourself, out
(after leaving your fee on the table), and another patient
takes your place. As the door closes behind you, you hear
the faint sounds of distant thumpings. And so it goes on,
from nine to one, in a never-en ; stream of rapidly-
interviewed pilgrims to the shrine of AEsculapius. Then
comes the perfectly-appointed but not luxuriousluncheon-
tray, with its two glasses of restorative Amontillado; and
then the well-hung chariot, with its four-hundred guinea
º: is at the door, and if we are to keep our eye
on the Healer, it must be no longer chez lui, but chez
son clientèle, in every part of the wide west-Énd,
from rococo Cavendish Square to brand-newest Ken-
singtonia. But the Doctor does not take a man on the
box; and though few places are beyond our ken, we are
not quite ubiquitous.
Nor need we care to follow the Healer home again
from his daily round. Is not private life sacred? And
yet one scene more. It is night. The Healer's house is
a blaze of lights. The waiting-room contains a supper
with all the delicacies of the season, for the pastrygook
who has taken the contract has charged fifteen shillings
a-head! The gentlemen of the pantry must have in-
creased assistance to-night. The roll and roar of car-
riages ceases not without. Upstairs, in the gorgeous
drawing-room, are the guests, including all the cele-
brities of the ãay, civil and military, literary and scien-
tific, fashionable and financial, musical and theatrical.
In one corner a celebrated author is reading extracts
from his works to a rather languid audience. In another,
a professional negro serenader, banjo in hand, is singing
with much feeling a popular comic song. The Healer,
now in his favourite character of Host, is circulating
around, with a smile for the Ladies, a flashing joke, or
a profound conundrum for the Men, when a servant hur-
riedly approaches him, and whispers in his ear. Five
minutes later the perfectly-appointed brougham is dash-
ing through the streets at the rate of the Flying Dutch-
man. It contains the Healer, bent on a mission of
mercy. . . . Such is his life, full of mysteries and confi-
dences, blind guesses and rapid inductions, vast gains
and large benevolences, sensations and delights, guineas,
honours, and contrasts.

THE COMING MAN FOR TURKEY.
THE fall of MIDHAT PASHA may very probably prove the means
of affording Turkey a good chance of salvation. According to the
Vienna correspondent of the Times, there has lately come into the
foreground a man who, though for sometime little heard of, is begin-
*ś be considered by well-informed persons “a not unlikely
candidate for the post of definitive Grand Vizier.” This is a Turk
of exceptional integrity, virtue, and intelligence, by name AHMED
REFIK EFFENDI, who has served his country in several high offices
of State suggessively, and, during his intervals of, leisure, has
always º “to dig and plant in his garden on the hill-side, and to
indulge his taste for reading and study.” . How elevated a taste for
study and reading is that, which actuates this literary Turkish
Cincinnatus, the whole world will discern from the statement that,
amongst English and other cultivated residents in Turkey, by some
of whom he was regarded as one of the most fanatical and dangerous
of “Old Turks”—
“Those who, being under this impression, made his acquaintance, may
have been not a little astonished to find a man as well up in the latest works
of English and French literature as they were themselves, a man who took in
Punch and Chariwari, and laughed over them as heartily as any man could.”
It would be mere mock-modesty to refrain from anticipating the
observation which the foregoing words will suggest to everybody,
that a Grand Vizier being not only a constant reader of Punch, but
also capable of understanding and appreciating the contents of these
pages, is likely to regenerate and save his country, if anybody in the
slippers of a Grand Vizier can. May AHMED REFIR EFFENDI live
to do it; and that he may have plenty of time to do it in, may His
; live a thousand years, continuing to take in and read

IMITATIVE BENEWOLENCE.
(A Hint to Noble Sportsmen.)
MoRE than once or twice during the shooting season, the constant
reader of his newspaper may therein discover pleasant little unpre-
. paragraphs, recording very simply such kind acts of grace
as these :-
“HER MAJEsty has forwarded, from Windsor, twenty brace of pheasants
to St. George's Hospital.”
“Presents of game have been dispatched from Sandringham, by order of
the PRINCE of WALes, for the use ºthe patients in the London hospitals.”
Imitation, we are told, is the truest form of flattery, and we feel
§§ sure that both HER MAJESTY and the PRINCE of WALEs would
e flattered by a loyal imitation of their gifts. Noble sportsmen
would do well to emulate their betters; and instead of sending all
their surplus game to be sold for them at Smithfield, they should
send some of it, at least, to the Hospital of St. Bartholomew, adja-
cent to the market. Battues are abominable; but there might be
some excuse for them, if their proceeds were distributed among the
sick and suffering poor. As a rule, there is small interest in the
statements of “good sport” which are paraded in the newspapers,
describing how the noble army of Swells at Crackshot Castle have
destroyed, in the last three days, some five thousand head of game.
Such paragraphs, however, might well deserve publicity if they
conveyed an intimation that the game had been presented to the
London Hospitals, and that the carriage of it thither had been
charitably paid.
sensATION IN BELGRAVIA.
CHAwles and JoHN THOMAs are in great tribulation, as they have
heard Vaccination is to be administered direct from the calf. Their
situations, they complain, won't have a leg to stand on, if they are to
be punctured for the benefit of babies.
A WONDERFUL DISCOVERY.
A CoRRESPONDENT sends us an anagram, revealing in a new Peer
what the world has long been in the dark about:—“THE EARL OF
BEACONSFIELD–The real Face of Old Ben.”

HOSPITALITY AND PLUNDER.
INForMED by telegram that “LoRD DERBY had re-
ceived an address signed º a numerous body of English
traders, complaining of the Brigandage in Sicily, and
requesting him to call in the most pressing manner the
attention of the Italian Government to the subject,”
the Public, Parliament, and Press of Italy have been
thrown into a fit of flºº at what they call “an
egregious breach of the hospitality extended to British
residents in the Island.” Strange to say, what they
mean by breach of hospitality appears not to have been
the seizure of MR. Rose by brigands, their detention of
him in their mountain den, in constant danger of his life,
and his release for a ransom of £2,400,—no; it seems
that, from the Italian point of view, the hospitality
extended to British residents in Sicily was broken by
MR. Rose's fellow-countrymen and fellow-residents in
complaining of that and similar outrages to the British
Government. Well, there's nothing like looking at
things your own way!

HOW TO MAKE HOME SAFE.
(Respectfully dedicated to CAPTAIN SHAw.)
“There were over a hundred fires in the Metropolis last week.”—Weekly
Paper.
1. In the first place I, Punch, would have you careful in the
matter of matches. Avoid those to which Proprietors and Manu-
facturers have given the title “Safety,” for use can be made of
them only when you have the box by you. Rather choose those
which strike not º on the box, but on anything. By employ-
ment of these yourself, and by encouraging the careless use of them
by your servants, you may do your part in keeping up the average
of Metropolitan conflagrations.
. 2. In these days of universal improvement your house is probably
lighted with gas from attic to basement. On this head I have little
to say. Remember, however, the proverb which illustrates the
futility of seeking for anything in the dark. If, therefore, you smell
as, and are thus warned of an escape, go, or send one of your
ousehold, with a lighted candle, to discover the source of it.
3. If there be no Gas in your house, it is probable that you will
use oil lamps. Paraffin will do for your dining and drawing-rooms.
In the ". schoolroom, or wherever else there is likely to be
ramping, employ petroleum or kerosine. Consider the Cow of
ºn 1 -
4. Never indulge in Fire-Guards. They intercept great part of
the heat of the fire, which no prudent householder can afford at the
present prices of coal. If, in §: absence, a gassy coal explodes,
and the fragments are projected into the room, how can you possibly
be to blame?
5. Some housewives are of opinion that linen should be aired
gradually. This is mere old-fashioned nonsense, unsuited to an
age too rapid to permit of things being done slowly. ... Air your

CHAPTER I.-The Jesuit Chief.
IN a spacious arched and vaulted chamber, whose stones could
have told of the darkest and foulest deeds ever perpetrated in the
history, of mankind when under, the shadow of the broad triple-
crowned tiara, which was assumed by the persecuting pontiffs of the
mediaeval period in cutting, cruel, and deadly ridicule of the cos-
tume of the oppressed Hebrew race, which, at that time, still clun
to the traditional head-gear of a happier past,-in, I say, an arche
and vaulted chamber of the large building, about which there is
something at once prisonly and palatial, at the corner of the Piazza
di Septetti Diali," were gathered some of the most remarkable persons
in the world,
whose names

At a table, listening to the fºrmured recital of a cowled
figure, sat one towards whom, from time to time, all eyes furtivel
glanced. He was dressed in a long gown, called a “biritta, ºf whic
entirely concealed the closely-woven coat of chain armour that pro-

feared, namely, the assassins in his pay. For him, bravos belonging

The gloomy chamber was hung around with various instruments
of torture, which, though superseded by modern improvements
and inventions, still retain their terrible significance, and cause a

In different corners, for the apartment is all corners and angles,
sat sombre-hooded figures at desks, watching with lynx-like eyes
the complicated movements of the telegraphic-needles, in front of

Gentlemen, this was the man before whom all Europe in reality quailed; to whom Princes

in a dark corner with a box in his hand. This box he now opened. It was filled with

Notes BY THE TALENTED AUTHOR.
Of course I limit myself entirely to facts, either within my own personal and peculiar knowledge,
or sworn to by those in whom, from their position and exceptional opportunities of observation, I
have every confidence. I have already spent
hundreds, I may º: thousands, in unearthing the
machinations of the Jesuits in this country—I
have been content to bear the obloquy cast upon
me by the satellites of the Roman Secret Monastic
Societies—and, alas! I have actually been held
up to suspicion (how baseless my conscience and
constituents best know) of being myself a Popish
Emissary!!—and this too by the once eminent
Protestant Champion, MR.N-D-G-TE, who, I fear,
is after all but an unconscious tool in the hands
of astute Cardinals and wily Italian Prothona-
tanis. I defy DR. M-NN-G and all his works (not
one of which I would ever read, nor even accept
as a birthday present), and dare the whole Con-
sistory and College of Bishops and Council of
Seminarists to disprove in detail any one of the
Facts, or contradict any single one of the state-
ments which I shall put before the public in this
true and thrilling narrative, which should rouse
all England from its torpor, and cause Parlia-
ment to send a carefully-selected body of firemen,
with hose and hatchet, into the cellars of the
house.
I would not employ a policeman or fireman if
Ihad my way, unless he were §: examined
by a competent Protestant Committee, and had
received from the examiners a certificate of his
thorough acquaintance with the Catechism, and
had taken a good strong anti-Popish oath with-
out evasion, reservation, or mental equivocation
whatsoever. For me, I would go to the stake
cheerfully for my opinions, and I should be very
lad to see others go there too, and remain there.
or my part, I do not think I should care to do
more than go to the stake for my opinions, get
my opinions, and come back again. For the sake
of the Protestant cause I would give up almost
anything except, perhaps, my pipe, which is a
great comfort to me when I am stumping at
Peterborough, and which I miss in the House.
I shall go on with this Novel as long as I can
in order to expose the system of tyranny and
duplicity which keeps an excellent nobleman out
of his property simply because he is a butcher,
and, therefore, opposed to Lenten diet and fish on
Fridays. But my time is fully occupied, and my
leisure moments. I devote to singing lessons.
When next asked to sing I shall do so—and
charge for it.—G. W.
CRYSTAL PALACE IMPROVEMENT.
Is the Crystal Palace worth preserving?
This is a question not raised in a pamphlet
Ş. MR. GLADSTONE, but by the RD
AYoR, at a meeting of public-spirited
gentlemen, held the other afternoon at
the Mansion. House, to consider “the
best means to maintain and preserve
the Crystal Palace for the use of the
people, in fulfilment, of the objects, for
which it was originally founded.” They
ultimately resolved that, “in view of the
eat public advantage of the Crystal
alace, it is desirable that it, should be
maintained for the public,” and appointed
a Committee to confer with the Directors to
that end. Thus the question before, the
meeting was answered in the affirmative
but not absolutely. They voted the Crystal
Palace worth. *...* to effect the
objects for which it was founded, and not
**, h template t
e former they contemplate promoting
by a large and #. i. for “the
cultivation of arts, sciences, and manu-
factures, and the providing of good and
elevating recreation for the public,” and
for those who join in the undertaking, “a
substantial return in the shape of valuable
works of Art.” -
Among the objects for which the Palace
was designed, rope-walking, circus-riding,
and Cockney diversions in general were not
included. Punch h y wishes, under
new arrangements, better luck to the Crystal
* and a return to the original inten-
OL18.

A CASE FOR CLERGYMAN-HELPS.
GIVEN occasion for Gentleman-Helps generally, does
not a plºt suggest itself in particular for Clergyman-
Helps? To a certain extent every Curate is a Clergy-

in his Employer's Parsonage, or Palace, clean boots and
shoes, knives and forks, wait at table, officiate in the
stable, and work in the garden, being ail the while as far
as possible treated as one of the family. His wages of
£100 a vear or so would then º him with some of
the comforts of life, and perhaps enable him to put by a
little provision, besides, for a season of being out of place,
or a rainy day of disestablishment and disendowment.

THE “DREADNOUGHT” ASHORE.
BEAR a hand there, Ladies and Gentlemen with a shot in the locker
for poor JACK! The publication of the last Report, read the other day
at the Fifty-Sixth Annual Meeting of the Seamen's Hospital Society,
will tend to correct a confusion of ideas, injurious to that charit-
able institution. When people are advertised that contributions
and subscriptions thereunto are received by the Bankers, Rs.
WILLIAMs, DEACON, & Co., Birchin Lane, or by the Secretary,
“Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich,” they are apt to imagine them-
selves invited to contribute to the maintenance of Greenwich
Hospital itself. Supposing, Greenwich, Hospital well enough en-
dowed, and supported besides with public money, they are apt to
decline that invitation,
The smaller Hospital has got to be confounded with the greater,
especially among seamen of the Mercantile Marine, in consequence
of the removal on shore of the Seamen's Hospital from on board the
old Dreadnought, so long a conspicuous object in the Thames, sug-
gestive of pleasing associations with whitebait. But the Report
abovementioned now informs its readers that the Seamen's Hospital,
Greenwich, receives no aid from Government whatsoever, except
houseroom; the use of the Infirmary on their premises at Green-
wich, instead of the loan of a ship, to the additional comfort of the
patients indeed, but the proportionate increase of expenditure of
quite fifteen per cent, for their maintenance, requiring to be met by
voluntary contributions. . -
Now all this is explained, it may be hoped that the Seamen's
Hospital will cease to, suffer from a misconception precisely similar
in its effect to the detriment sustained by MEssrs. SHADRACH's
establishment at the hands of MESSRs. ºrga, through the
dissemination of “the untradesman-like falsehood, ‘it’s the same
concern.'”
So far from being the same concern with Greenwich Hospital, the
Seamen's Hospital, Greenwich, is quite another concern. it is
free to sick seamen of all nations. ithin the scope of its cosmopo-
litan hospitality, come not, only medicine and surgery for nautical
sufferers, but also the provision; if possible, of employment for them
when cured. It contains two hundred beds constantly occupied;
and to keep charity going at this rate needs voluntary contributions
yearly to the amount of £8,000, or, rather, according to a state-
ment made in Cannon Street, of £10,000. It nearly paid its expenses
last year, but not quite; and owes, £1,539 6s. 0d. Every Briton,
whose song is “Pule, Britannia!' must see that, as an insti-
tution subservient to the spirit of that chorus, the Seamen's Hos-
Fºl (late Dread ht) is a charity beyond all others for which the
t may justifiably be sent round. Its expenditure has much in-
creased lately through the rise in provisions, amounting to £506
WOL. LXXII,
additional in the last year alone. A hospital, however, need not,
like , almost every individual member of the community except
butchers, be the worse off for “Progress.” Subscriptions, donations,
and bequests in plenty, on the part of a generous Public, will doubt-
less enable the Seamen's Hospital Society to keep pace with the
times, whilst all but the most economical housekeepers are out-
running the constable. The Dreadnought (that was) should have
nought to dread. -
A page of the Society's Report is occupied with a table of Ports in
the United Kingdom whence patients were sent them last year—so
many from each; together with a list of annual subscriptions sent
also by those Ports—some of them. For, in several instances, op-
posite to a considerable figure in the Patients' column, the Subscrip-
tion column presents “Nil.” We need only remind those who thus
show their unremitting interest in the Hospital, that earnihilo nihil fit
—“Nothing can come of nothing”—in the long run; though they
have made their own nothings, thus far, produce something consider-
able. . Let them clap the omitted figure to the left of their round 0's,
and give them their proper values.
THE EYE-OPENER FOR ENGLAND.
FROM the Blue Book on the Conference it appears that the SULTAN
was persuaded, notwithstanding LoRD SALISBURY's assurances to
the contrary, that “the alienation of a large portion of the English
people” from the side of Turkey “was due rather to the repudiation
of the Turkish debt than to the atrocities in Bulgaria.” Not quite
so, Padishah. No large portion of the .#. Fº is so ver
mercenary as all that. It was not the repudiation of the Turkis
debt which principally alienated even the Turkish bondholders from
you. It was those awful Bulgarian atrocities that did it. All that
the repudiation of the Turkish debt did was to open the eyes of
the British Public, and especially those of Turkey's Creditors, to
the atrocity of the Bulgarian atrocities.
The Porte and the Powers.
IT is whispered that a high Turkish Official, speaking of the six
Governments represented at the late ineffectual Conference,
observed, at a late Divan, that they might call themselves the six
Powers, but he, for his part, called them the six Weaknesses.

the Long Parliament, and the Rump and the Parliaments after the
King's joyful Restoration, when money was so hard to come by for all,
and Our Office especially, in such straits. Though, indeed, save in the
matter of money, it do seem as if Our Office were still for the most part
in as sorestraits as when I was Clerk of the Acts, and as many mis-
haps among our ships, and the Board abused, on all hands, as
roundly; but, Lord, to see how coolly they do take it, so as my LoRD
SANDwich himself could not have borne the storm more easily.”

Monday, February 12 (Lords).-Question by my LoRD DUKE OF
ST, ALBANs, touching the Officers of Her Majesty's Engineers sent
out last autumn to Constantinople, to what end was their survey of
the defences thereof, and what the Turk was like to have thought of
the same, as promising them from us help in need. But my LoRD
CADogAN answered roundly that these Officers had surveyed and re-
rted for service of Her Majesty's Government, and not of the
k, and as for what the Turk might argue thereof, they of the
Government knew not, and had no need to trouble themselves, with
which my Lord Duke was fainto be content; and methinks my LoRD
CADoGAN, for a young Lord, hath already well learnt the manner of
answering, that we had in my time in Our Office, when saucy rogues
would put questions easier to ask than to answer.
And then the Lords to mighty serious debate of the new
roadway at Hyde Park Corner, which do much concern many of
my Lords, their wives and daughters, that do drive oft that way,
and are sore hindered by the great press of common coaches, and
marvellous to see how all wheeled carriages be multiplied in this town
since the first licensing of the hackney coaches which I remember.
My LoRD BEACONSFIELD did speak mighty, solemnly on this grave
matter; and methinks it is well their Lordships should give their
minds to other questions than Eastern. But no new road yet, nor,
methinks, like to be this long while, but much sedulous consideration

by the Board of Works of the reasons against all that are proposed.
And, indeed, it is no light matter for my Lords and their Ladies,
and for the Board of Works, that may not fitly go to work but onfull
consideration.
(Commons.)--To question of MR. AsHLEY, MR. Bourke, a brisk
young man, and Under Secretary to my LoRD Brmy, had a hard busi-
ness in º: of the steps taken by the Turk in compliance with
my LoRD DERBY's sharp letter touching the punishment of those con-
eerned in the Bulgarian atrocities, wherein many sentences have
been passed, as I did gather, but could hear of neither sentences nor
offenders executed as yet, but a Commission still examining and
seeking for what the French call Midi di quatorze heures. Pleasant
to hear how SHEFKET PASHA, the leader of all the atrocities, is not
under arrest, but under surveillance, which do seem to me .
different. So the upshot of all do seem to be, much said but nothing
done, as is usual with the Turk.
Then other replies to other questions touching these Turkish
matters, as of the Loan, and the departure of SIR HENRY ELLIOT,
and a certain despatch of my LoRD DERBY's; and I do see plainly
there is like to be no lack of questions for my LoRD DERby and SIR
STAFFORD NonTHcote, and I do wish them both well delivered of
. lºwer. Then much other confused business, which I could
not note,
Atlast the House to debate sharply of MR.SMYTH's Bill for Closing
of Irish Public-houses on Sunday, which the Government be of a
mind to grant, as it were experimentum in corpore vili, though they
will none of it here. But, Lord, to see how Irish Members do con-
tradict each other flatly herein, as in other ... one O'SULLIVAN
crying the Bill down as a wicked thing “to affect the interests of
many thousand Irishmen, and to restrict the liberty and ancient
rivileges of Ireland,” whereof, doubtless, the privilege of gettin
on Sunday, as on other days, is one of the most ancient. An
then to hear one Šurrºº, withºut theºû,” calling lustily for the
ill; and a gross, fat man, one MAJOR O'Gorm AN, mighty, loud
against it, and methinks did bear him as like the fat knight in
SHARSPEARE's play as ever I saw ; and much laughter of the House,
whether at his brogue or his belly I could not learn, but do believe
the one did help the other. Among other things of this O'Gorman's
that moved the House to mirth, was this, that for an Irishman to
get drunk on a Sunday anywhere, save in a licensed public-house,
though it were sub Jope frigido—the fat, Major being one that can
Latin, as indeed, most of your Irish be scholars, after, some
sort—was an insult to the Queen's Majesty, which puzzled...me,
But whether the Irish people be in truth for or against this Bill, I
know not. For the biggesttowns—Dublin, Cork, Belfast, Waterford,
Limerick—the Secretary for Ireland did hold it wise to have in-
uiry made of the matter by Select Committee. And methinks if
the public-houses cannot be shut on Sundays, in these great towns,
it is little that they should be shut in smaller places. But Irish
reasons are, and have ever been since first I heard of them, hard to
fathom. So I wish the Bill a good deliverance, and no more heads
or windows broken than is needful. - -
Then a Bill moved for Valuation of Property for Rating, being a
remanet from last year—like so many of the Bills this Session. But
whether this Bill be better or worse than last year's, I know not.
And methinks the House was no wiser than I, which comforts me.
Only I am thankful there were no such Bills, and few such rates, in
my time.
Also a Bill touching Patents brought in ; the same that they have
been trying to pass these two years. But whether this one will be
got passed I could not learn. Yet methinks it is sore needed, for
inventions do multiply strangely, beyond aught that was dreamed
of in my time; and where they will stop, I see not. Lord grant it
may all be for good. But am glad of one thing, that MR; ATToRNEY-
GENERAL do own that poor men, have a right to profit by the work
of their brains, whereto this Billis meant to help; so I wish well to it.
Tuesday º: LoRD GRANVILLE to question, of my LoRD
DERBy touching the treaty for mutual delivering up of law-breakers
passing between this country and the United States of America,
whither in my time they did deport rogues, but they now, it seems,
being their own masters, do send their rogues to us, and we ours to
them, as it were in the way of barter. -
And my LoRD DERBY to explain how herein matters are again as
they were, before he did get into a quarrel with one FISH, the
States' Secretary, last year;. so I do find my Lord hath had tº

SAWBATH RECREATION.
Gentleman from M. B. (he had sent his Presbyterian Butler to a service at West.
minster Abbey). “WELL, DUGALD, what Did You THINK of IT "
Dugald. “AwkEL, SIR, IT was MAIR LIKE HEEv'N THAN AIRTH.; But E-H,
SIR, IT's JUST AN Awfu' way o' speNNIN THE SAwBATH, Yon I l’”
a grace as ever I saw, and much chuckling thereat among my Lords of the Oppo-
sition. Pleasant to see how friendly their Lordships be on both sides, and how
smooth-spoken, and my LoRD GRANVILLE one of the pleasantest, yet can give
a smart rap with a smiling face. And after, the same Lord mighty curious to
know why, in the papers touching the Eastern Question, was no word of my
LoRD SALISBURY's conversations with PRINCE BIsMARCK, and PRESIDENT MAC.
MAHON, and the Duc, DECAZEs, but did assume it was for convenience of the
ublic service, to which my Lord DERby did agree. So I could not see why my
RD GRAN VILLE should ask the question.
My LoRD DERby did add, wisely, that some talk with foreign Ministers was of
no account, and such it was good to publish: but some of grave account, and as
to that sort the public were best kept in the dark. Which puzzled me.
(Commons.)-More questioning of Ministers; and one SAMUELson, a brisk
man, asking if my LoRD BEAconsºreLD, when he spoke so warlike at Guild-
hall last December, had in his pocket the letter of His Majesty the CzAR of
Muscovy, vouching his will for peace, SIR STAFFORD Northcore did answer
him so shortly and roundly as moved the laughter of the House; meanin
that my Loºp BEACONSFIELD did look on the §. letter as but a canard,
or Muscovy Duck, which is the name they give now to flams on public matters.
But how the CzAR would stomach his letter being so taken, I wonder.
Then MR. FAwcETT, a mighty, clear-spoken man in matters of Finance,
and sharp-sighted for all he is blind, i;"move to reappoint the Select Com-
mittee, that has sat for three years inquiring into Indian Finance, but never yet
got so far as reporting, so that I was reminded of the hen, that laid so many
eggs she could never come to the hatching of any. For their reappointment he
did give mighty good reasons, and indeed when a man thinks over all he said,
the one reason, against such a Committee would seem to be that its work can
only be well done in India; and asks rather for a great Minister of Finance
than the best Committee that ever did hatch a Blue Book, which, as yet, this
* hath not done, only taken more evidence than anybody will ever care
read.
And tº this effect spoke one SMoulett, a rough-tongued man, but ready, and
a hard hitter all round, and would have had the House yote to leave off all
spending on public works in India, and eease to distinguish between ordinary
and extraordinary expenses in. its reckoning. Which methinks were a starving
of the horse to save the cost of his feed. And was smartly rapped over the
knuckles by a mighty brisk young LoRD GEORGE HAMIL-
Ton, of the Indian Secretary’s Office, that it was a
pleasure to hear how trippingly he spoke, and yet to
the point; so that it was pretty to see how well he had
learnt his lesson; and the House did cheer him mightily
when he went into the Indian accounts, and showed a
brave array of figures against MR. FAwcETT, and made
out things in #. hopeful and thriving, save for this
famine and fall in silver, and was for no Committee, so
the House did say no to FAwcETT by 173 to 123, and to
SMolleTT without a division, all being against him save
himself, and methinks he is one of that sort that do often
find themselves in a minority of one.
Wednesday.—Being Ash Wednesday, the Lords sat
not at all, and the Commons not till two, for which I
Was º: ..". already wearied of my week's work,
* new not before they sat so late, and talked so
inuon.
A Bill to guard the mouths of thrashing-machines–
and might, methinks, be extended to the House of
Commons, where be many machines with mouths that
grind chaff, and so waste time. -
One PARNELL moved a Bill to enable buyers of Irish
Church lands to spread their payments over fifty-two
years, and to pay *; at first *:::: hich
methinks was cool, even for an Irish Member to ask;
and the House would none of it, though the Irish Home-
Rule Members of one mind for once. So the Bill was
thrown out by 150 to 110.
A Bill, moved by one, WILson, to forbid the Sale
of Drink on Sundays in England and Wales. The first
child, methought, of MR. SMYTH's Bill, and much debate
whether leave should be given to bring it in or no, and,
in the end, leave given, which I was sorry for.
Thursday (Lords).-Nought worth noting but my
LoRD DUKE of ARGYLL's notice of Question for next
Tuesday on my LoRD SALISBURY's instructions, and if
the Government propose to do aught, and what, in fur-
therance thereof. -
(Commons.)—More questions. MR. WARD HUNT did
explain to SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL how HobART PASHA,
an English Captain, commanding the navy of the Turk,
having been struck off the list and pay of his rank in
1868, was in 1874 restored to the same, but no reason
given. And in Our Office methinks, in my time, we had
not restored one of our Captains who had taken service
with the Infidel. But now 'tis otherwise-only land-
officers may not so serve without leave first given; which
uzzles me, to find a reason why what is sauce for the
and-bird should not be sauce also for the sea-fowl.
To SIR WILLIAM HARcourt SIRSTAFFORD Northcote
did explain how SIR HENRY ELLIOT did leave Constan-
tinople like the other Ambassadors—being ordered home
to report, but not in disgrace, and was sick—whereat no
wonder, with the sickening work he hath had.
Then one RyūANDs, a man of a rasping tongue, to move
the rejection of the Prisons' Bill, for bringing of prisons
under the control of Government; and much bravetalk
of Local Self-Government, which is, indeed a grand
thing to talk of: and one CHAMBERLAIN, the stout and
high-stomached member for Birmingham, and MR.
Nºw prºte, a solemn-spoken gentleman of Warwick-
shire, and 'SIR WALTER BARTTELot, a lusty Sussex
Baronet, did follow on the same side;. and º
to see how the two country gentlemen did sleek an
stroke down the Birmingham man, but all to no ºur-
pose, for the House, thinking the Bill needful, and no
theºk to local self-government, however it might be to
local jobbery, and like to bring better governing of
prisons, did vote the Bill by 279 to 69.
Friday (Lords).-Mighty grave talk of business to be
done hereafter, but none done yet. And sure, LoRº
fºconspirid performs his new part as solemn as ever I
sees -
(Commons.)—The night's work begun by a question, of
SIR. C. DILRE –and sure never was such a quºtioning
as now a-nights, and, methinks, little reason for Members
to cali" question 7 Ouestion!” as they dº; seeing the
questions do come without calling. And so M.R. Bouh KE
to his reply, that the Government do meanto, answer the
Muscovite despatch, when the time comes, and they know
what to say, and what the other Powers are of a mind to
say, And then to Committee of Supply, but first MR.
Gºdstone to call attention to our treaties with the
fºrk and others, and to consider how we stand bound

thereby—and thereon as high and hot debate as ever I heard in
the headiest days of the Long Parliament, in the course whereof
one CHAPLIN, a Lincolnshire Squire, did make as if he would pluck
MR. GLADSTONE by the beard, who did take it in snuff, and did give
MASTER CHAPLIN, a young, brisk fellow, but one that is better known
for a horse-courser than a politician, such a tongue-basting as did
me good to hear, and methought I was at the handling of some
rake-helly young Cavalier by a grave Precisian, as it might be
MASTER PRYNNE or MASTER SELDEN, in the Protector's time.
For the rest, much wild and whirling talk of these treaties and
their force, between MR. HARDY, the Secretary for War, and LoRD
RoBERT MonTAGU, another of your brisk gallants, and Mr. Gºn
DUFF, a weasel-faced man, and shrill-voiced, but of rare repute for
knowing the minds and cities of many men, and wise beyond common
men's measure, and one CourTNEY, new come into the House for Lis-
keard, and as I do hear a smart writer, and one that looks to rise,
and indeed spoke more to the point than the rest, and one SMYTH,
an Irishman, mighty flowery and flowing of discourse, that it was
pretty to hear, and others, but I, sore weary of it all, and could pick
nought out but many “An this be so, then that is so.;” but what
these treaties do in truth bind us to, or the other Powers º
thereunto, or the Turk, or if indeed they bind either to aught, is
more than I could learn.
Qnly, MR. GLADSTONE do speak maryellous well, and weightily,
and, methought, glowed as with a white heat, that it was fine to
listen to him, and pity of MASTER CHAPLIN under his chiding; but
et mighty silly of him to shoot at one that beareth too many guns
or his tonnage.
And, so the debate º till next Friday, and I home in a
muddle. But I do see clearly that whatever these treaties be, no-
thing will come of them all. And so best. But methought, had the
old Protector been here, things would scarce run all thus to jangle
* tangle and talk as they do, and methinks will do for somewhile
yet.

EXPERIENCES OF ETON.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
KNow INg you are a bold defender of truth, I wish to offer
a remark on MR. GLADSTONE's statement at Marlborough the other
day, that Eton boys are worshippers of Mammon. ... I wish to good-
ness they were. Then possibly I might have got into “Pop” by
this time. (“Pop,” you know, is our name for the School Debating
Society, to which all the swells belong.) But they won't elect me,
just because I can't row or play cricket well, and I’m not in the
Sixth Form. I suppose I'm not what is called “popular ” among
the fellows. Why, my father could buy up any dozen of these
fellows who swagger about here as if the place belonged to them.
But they black-balled me when I tried to get into “Pop" last
half, which shows that they don't understand the value of money,
and are, therefore, even greater fools than MR. GLADSTONE imagines.
Yours faithfully,
JEton College. CROESUS MAJoR.
DEAR MR. PUNCH, ---
I KNow you’re a fast friend of the nobility, so perhaps you
won't mind my making a remark. Some fellow here told me that
GLADSTONE had been saying in a speech somewhere that Eton fellows
worshipped rank. I don't find it so, I assure you. You know I
belong to one of the oldest families in the peerage, and at home
I can bully the servants as much as I please, and everyone bows and
scrapes to me and calls me “My Lord!”. Now, somehow or other,
the fellows here don't see this. They all laughed when I tried it on.
And that low brute, SMITH_MAX, my fagmaster (I hope he won't
see this, or he'll work me off as sure as a gun), actually makes me
cook his beefsteak every morning, run up and down for him all day,
and make his tea and toast at night, just as if I was a commoner.
Confound his impudence!, But they don't understand the value of
rank at Eton, that's the plain truth of it. Yours,
Eton College. ToMNODDY.
GATES AJAR.
MR. PUNCH, respecting the cloth, is always sorry when the British
clerk in orders—out of the Pºlpi; of course—sinks to what may be
mildly described as “twaddle.” But when twaddle takes the
shape of *... and ignorance combined, Mr. Punch, feels
himself in duty bound to bring his bâton heavily over the delin-
quent's fingers. What rap could be too heavy for a certain REVEREND
MR. GATEs, who, at a recent meeting of ºp. with MR.
Tooth, at Warrington, said (alluding to LoßD PENZANCE) “that a
man who had spent all his life in adjusting the relationship of
adulterers and adulteresses was little fit to decide doctrines of the
Church "P
Now, what LoRD PENZANCE has to decide is, not what are the doc-
trines of the Church, but what are the laws of the realm; and what
is, and is not, in accordance with them; and his intimate acquaint-
ance with one branch of legal learning does not in any way affect
his qualifications in another. Mr. Punch is irresistibly reminded
of certain Pharisees who found fault with the Founder of the
Church for being seen in company with publicans and sinners; But
even they would scarce have cast stones at the Great Judge before
whom the sinning woman was brought for the “adjustment of her
relationship” with harshly-judging and erring mankind; yet here
is this Reverend Gentleman who, as Master Page says, “belike
having received wrongs by some person, is at most odds with his own
gravity and patience,” indulging in a most offensive insinuation
against one of the shining lights of the English Bench 1
Mr. Punch replies in the anything but shallow words of SHAK-
SPEARE–"I never heard a man of his place, gravity, and learning
so wide of his own respect; ” and sincerely hopes, though gentlemen
with such ideas are generally as obstinate as they are foolish, that
MR. GATEs is, before this, heartily ashamed of himself.
To An AnAGRAMMATIC CORRESPONDENT.
WHERE's the error? The EARL of BEACONSFIELD “is the real
face of Old Ben.” Who dares say he isn't P
WHY is Saturday the best day to make inquiries at the General
Post Office?
Because it’s ten to one you’ll find the Clerks’there, and on other
days it's ten to four.

Though there isn't much left to be fighting for, here is a sort of a bone:

A PLEA FOR A PORTICO.
THE Board of Works, as part of its plan for a new thoroughfare
from Tottenham Court Road to Charing Cross, propºs to swee
away the platform of the famous portico of St. Martin's Church, and,
instead, to stilt up the pillars on pedestals, and to limit the steps to
a break-neckstaircase from the church-doors to the face of the portico.
The Vicar writes to protest in the name of the parish—and he
º have added, of A. We have not so many good examples
of Palladian architecture in England that we can
about the best of them. -
If St. Martin divided his cloak with the beggar, that is no good
reason for the Saint dividing his portico—which may be symbolised
as his “dickey”—with the Board of Works, who are not beggar,
but choosers. In this case let Parliament say, “We don't choose.”
The refusal may lead to some alteration in the plans, even to some
deviation from the proposed line of street. But what though *
St. Martin de Tours will but be St. Martin de Détours! And the
portico is well worth a circumbendibus.

SPELLING REFORM.
Last night, at the .."; of the Jolly Codgers, Blue Lion,
Seven Dials, the proposed Spelling Reform was #. MR.
WILLIAM SIKEs presided, and among those present were Coster-
MONGER Robert, FAKEMENT Joe, RoRky WILLIAM, SAILoR. ToM, &c.
The Chairman, in opening the discussion, said, that the nation
demanded Reformed Spelling. (“’Ear, ear!”) The present system
was most vexatious to a gentleman whose time for schooling was
limited. When he was a ploughman—which he was proud to say
he had whistled at the plough, and precious hard work it was,
and soon took the whistle out of a chap worse than the crank—
some meddlesome fellow had the cheek to say in an arºmen; that
cough, and plough were spelt the same way, (“Shame . "). He did,
though. But what did he (the Chairman) do? He knocked the cové
down, and the beaks gave him three months for it. (“Oh, oh!”)
Wasn't reform needed. (Cheers.)
SAILOR TOM entirely concurred with the remarks of the last
speaker, although, from experience, he was bound to say he did not
believe a single word of 'em. (“’Ear, ear!”). Reform was needed.
His own plan was the best. He'd tell 'em what it was. He was
called SAILOR, although he had been christened THoMAs CoRAM,
arter the street where he was found on a doorstep and conveyed to
the Foundlins Orspital. And when he signed his name to articles
he put down a cross, and there was no bother about spelling. He
warn’t much of a scholar, but shiver his timbers if he could see why
some of the big wigs could not adapt his system to everythink.
FAKEMENT Joe had been convinced of the iniquitousness of our
lling ever since that great and glorious martyr SIR Roger
HARLEs Doughty TICHBoRNE had been sent to prison for not spelling
his words according to harbitery rules.
The meeting here paused to give three cheers for DR. KENEALY,
On resuming business it was discovered that FAKEMENT JoE had
gone. It was also discovered that he had gone without paying his
share of the reckoning. It was further discovered that one or two
little articles belonging to various gentlemen had gone with him.
CostERMongeB Robert said that all he wanted was that words
should be spelt as pronounced. . Notwithstanding the accident to
the Chairman (Cheers) he would knock anyone down who said
that d-o-n-k-e-y spelt moke. He had been eddicated in his youth,
and found out that all this spelling was the fault of DR. Johnson.
(Groans.) Who was this JoHNson? Why he was a noosepaper man in
the neighbourhood of Fleet Street. Fleet Street was one of his many
itches. There was a deal of noosepaper men thereabouts still, and
e did not think much of 'em. They talked about the history of the
language. That be blowed. They said if you altered the spelling
they used now to the new way, you wouldn't be able to read books
pººl. the old way. Bother books! They warn’t no good as ever
e see. Give a cove a barrer, and let him 'arn his own grub.
Ready money and no accounts was his motter, and on that a gove
could get along werry well without readin and writin. He’d fight
any man therefor half-a-crown. (Cheers.)
RoRKy. WILLIAM thought the School-Board was at the bottom of
it all. He was a cat's-meat man. (Laughter.), They might laugh,
but it was a noble calling. The School-Board did it. His little
boy was at school, and only last night home he comes, and he says,
“Father, what's written on your basket is wrong. ‘Katsmete’ is
incorrect.”. So I says, “Is it, my shaver? ... How do you spell
that?” And I gives him a tidy dusting... The meeting might
depend upon it, School-Boards was aggèrawating. -
Somebody then asked whether the Chairman was going to stand
anything. The Chairman said he wasn't. Somebody else threw a
pewter pot at the Chairman. The Chairman put out the gas. A
smart interchange of opinions, then ensued..., Finally, the whole
meeting, ...; by five constables (placed at their disposal through
the courtesy of MR. INspector X 1), proceeded to Bow Street, where
they passed the night.
On Seeing Mr. Clayton in “All for Her,” and afterwards
in “The Danischeffs.”
THE Heroes in both plays have this in common—
They're far too good for our self-seeking life:
One his head loses for a charming woman,
And tºother to another gives his wife.
Who'll the first follow in such abnegation ?
What modern lover for his love would die?
But is the other act past imitation?
“Oh no l’—a crowd of henpecked husbands cry.

authorities, as BoBLöT, and ERETUN (ride Metrop, Imp. Wol. ii.

ancients, bounded on the north by the Tural Ural Mountains, and
on the south by the Great Kittjenn Range, lies the fertile region of
tion of the community is the long nose, with which the stranger
meets at every turn of the conversation, at once º: all
serious, reply to earnest inquiry, and producing feelings akin to
distrust and repugnance on the part of the impressionable traveller.
The central and most civilised division of this district, called
Kapul Kaut, is situated within a few hours' march of Kamii, and is
inhabited } various Mahommedan, Christian, Persian, Jewish, and
other nomad races—the Stirpes Nominsanae of the ancients, modelled
on the manner of the traditional Sitti communities, herding together
for common protection from the wild Bulls and savage Bears, and
only collecting their means of existence from the considerable ad-
mixture, and daily extended sprinkling, of foreign Stocks...
It is a .# through which have passed, from time to time, the
Hems, the Hahs, the Guls, the Noguls, the Svindlahs, the Dūhs,
the shamme, and the Hums. These last, compelled, in their west-
ward course, to flee from the vicinity of the Bug, from causes analo-
gous to those which have forced more civilised races to retire from
continental caravanserai, and to quit furnished apartments on the
various sea-boards, have finally settled on the Tartaric basin. Here

of our Editorial discretion, we were compelled to return the remainder of the
MS. romance commenced in our last week's issue by MR. Geo. H. WH-LL-Y.
Qf course after this we must expect to be stigmatised by the Member for
Peterborough as Jesuits and Anti-Claimantists. We have no doubt that The
Masked Monk will prove a most thrilling and exciting romance, if restricted
to about half an . novel volume; but we regret that in its
present form it is unsuited to the tone of this journal. We have returned it
to MR; Geo. H. WH-L1-Y, at Peterborough, reminding him that compression
is the better of authorship. In this present number we give a chance to
an eminent Hand, whose first instalment will be welcomed with pleasure,
and, we hope, read with interest.—ED.

4, b, e, &c. As this occupied too much space, we have extracted the essence

Ben Trovato, Cap. vi.)
. At the time of the commencement of my story the advanced intel-
ligence, of the people was casting off for ever the vile slough of
servitude, and was preparing to offer a desperate and patriotic
resistance to the cruel and treacherous Mussulman.
The Secret Societies were sitting and hatching, but the revolu-
tionar # had not yet shown its pecker through the thin
superficial shell, nor, as yet, had any effort been made to get rid of
the heavy yoke. To one of these secret societies belonged the young
HUPSILON, Hellenic chieftain, who had been solemnly and eccle:
siastically united to the fair IoTA by PHILAKUPoLDos, the celebrated
Greek Particle of Constantinople. These Uniates would have lived
happily, but for a sudden note from OPHEKLEIDOs, the leader of the
Insurgent Band, who, however, was only an instrument, though a
powerful one, in the hands of others. This latter, namely OPHE-
KLEIDOs, was by profession the editor of a daily Anthelleniciournal
called the Pellmellos Gazettos, which from time to time startled the
world by the loudness, and not infrequently by the falseness, of its
occasional notes, which it is said were for the most part inspired by
one BLASTOs, the King's Chamberlain.
I do not undervalue the services of a free Press in a free State, as
I have before now proved to those who once knew how to conduct a
penny diurnal, nor am I blind to the advantages of printer's ink
the more than fifty-four thousand copies of one of my sensational
pamphlets being an argumentum ad pocketum that no mere human
testimony to the contrary can withstand; but I can never suffi-
ciently estimate the flattery of which the Pellmellos Gazettos made
me the object, when its talented Editor, quoting from certain books
about the “Bulgarian Horrors,” paid me the unprecedented com-
pliment of adopting the method, which I had previously employed
when writing on Catholic Allegiance, that is, of garbling authorities
wherever it was possible, though the same gentleman fell short of
his model in not attempting to translate what he did not under-
stand, and in not mistranslating the text wherever it made
strongly against his own case. The Pellmellos Gazettos, edited by
OPHEKLEIdos, is written “hominibus ad homines”—I should say
*iomºnº ad dominº (vide Class. Dict., Art. “Bal de l'Opéra,”
No. 1 Le Domino), and I can only characterise the articles to which
I refer as a stupendous effort to whitewash the heroes of Bulgarian
Horrors, for the sake of the holders of Belgravian Houses.f
+ + + + + +
+ It was when we arrived at this point in the Novel (?) that we, in our
Editorial capacity, ventured to send to the illustrious Author, to inquire, in
the politest manner possible, “when the story, was going to begin?” In
reply to this, we received what the eminent writer was pleased to term “a
letter,” but which was in reality a small pamphlet, explaining to us-firstly,
how the present work had ever come to be written; secondly, giving us a
sketch of the literature of the world up to the present time; thirdly, a review
of Lord Beaconspirºp's policy, as traceable in his romances; fourthly,
showing us what would be his §. E. G.'s) answer to certain probable ques-
tions concerning the work in hand; fifthly, explaining to us that his strongest
situation in the Fiftieth Chapter was founded on an episode in the Bulgarian
Horrors; sixthly, giving us a valuable and learned disquisition on the Ameri-
can interest in the discovery of Agamemnon's tomb; seventhly, impressing
upon us the local colouring which he intended to give in his Fifth Wolume,
where the scene would be laid in Wales, when he would treat us to a graphic
account of the disestablishment of the Early British Church by AugustiNE;
eighthly, telling us how an entire volume, at present tº , would be
devoted to the History of the Axe in the Forests of England and Wales, illus-
trated with woodcuts; and, ninthly, pointing out, emphatically, the end, aim,
and general scope of the Novel, as bearing upon the political progress and the
liberal development of the Human Race.
Honoured, as we are, by this exhaustive and exhausting º: we regret
our inability to devote all our pages for the next six months to the publication
of this full and laborious answer to our simple question; nor, we add, also
with regret, can we proceed with this most interesting work of fiction, which,
however, we can confidently recommend to any large publishing firm, as likely
to command the immediate attention of the trade and the public.—ED.

farmer and his wife, at Iver-heath, near Slough, on a
wretched little nurse-girl of sixteen, hired by them
from the Princess Louise's Home at Wanstead.
But the horror of the case alone would not have led us
to harrow our readers' feelings even by allusion to the
disgusting ill-usage, by this well-matched pair of the
wretched girl, on whom they were allowed for a while
to wreak their devilish lust of tormenting. The re-
markable º which prompts Punch's comment, is
that when MRs. MoRRIs, the female tormentor, hired the
girl *: Home, she expressed to the Matron her regret
that she was not better-looking, as she wished her child
from the first “to look only on what was beautiful”
MRs. MoRRIs must evidently have been a person of the
most delicate aesthetic sensibilities. Who knows but
that she ill-used CARoll NE CARTER out of sheer disgust
with her plain face. Just as “a thing of beauty.”
would have been “a joy for ever,” the thing of home-
liness was a constant aggravation, and was made to pay
for her plain face by proddings from forks, lashings from
horse-whips, kickings up and down stairs from
MoRRIs's new boots, pinchings of pieces of flesh from her
bare body, pluckings, out of her hair by handfuls, and
breakings of her head and arm with the kitchen-poker.
“Serve her right!” What business had she to be so
provokingly plain, with a Mistress possessed by such a
strong sense of The Beautiful?
And what an instructive light does the case thus re-
garded throw on the profound truth, so earnestly of late
inculcated by a certain school of critics and artists
amongst us, of the absolute independence of Ethics and
AEsthetics, and the entire absence of correlation between
Art and Morals.

Since, he admitted SAM PEPys' Ghost to a hearing, Punch's sanctum has been the nightly resort of spirits, unbottled. Pity that
MESSRs. DAY & Co., the agents, of the Customs Bill of Entry Office, and those who invented the patent capsule that secures pure Cognac

A whole train of ghosts, who in the flesh frequented the Houses of Parliament, and reported the debates, even while it was against law
to convey Essence of Parliament beyond the doors of St. Stephen's—the ghost of ANDREw MARVELL, of Swift, of ADDIson, of DICK
STEELE, of Doctor JoHNson, nay, of Bozzy himself, and the gentle GoLDSMITH-have been bombarding Punch for leave to share the
labours of SAMUEL PEPys, his ghost, and to be allowed to aid in expressing the essence of the Collective, Wisdom for Mr. Punch. We
have in fact a ghostly reporter's staff ready to our hand, and may, as we see occasion, use it. Meanwhile we allow dear old SAMUEL

( 8:5–M. GLADSTONE was fain to know who were “the important personages” that SIR H. ELLIOT did write of as wishing to
drive the Turk out of Europe, to whom SIRSTAFFoRD Northcote did make answer he was sorry he could not be in SIR H. ELLIOT's mind—
methought he is better in his own—but did think thatº SIR HENRY did include MR.GLADSTONE himself among the said
“important personages,” wherein, indeed, SIR HENRY would but have been blundering with some that should have known better.
ut methinks this ripping up of old sores, and old dispatches, is poor work, and so the House and the country do seem to hold it, and
I do see there will be no more of it, which I am glad of, the House having other and more pressing business in hand, and, indeed, your
Englishman loves not crying over spilt milk. -
So MR. HARDY to his Universities Bill, and did show how he had strengthened the Oxford Commission, and shortened its duration,
whereof general approval. Only MR, Lowe, that I had longed mightily to hear, he being a man of marvellous quick wit, and a biting tongue,
though he hath somewhat too much affected the sharpening of it on such as he deems fools, and chiefly the sort of fellows who must
needs come a-pestering our Offices on Deputations—a thing we knew not in my time, and therein were the more favoured, but yet, if we
had had Deputations to Our Office, e'en at our hardest lack for money and captains and good guidance, I warrant me we would have founda
Lowe of our own to answer them—did speak mighty sharp, but not so wisely methought, against the Bill, as one for giving over the
Universities to be inquired of and regulated by Commissioners, which he would have had done rather by Parliament as wishing, methinks,
his own finger in the pie. But on the whole the Bill . , and methinks will pass.
And one HoPE, a facetious Dutchman, mighty pleasant on the ghangº of parts betwixt the Conservative Government that hath

shall make them. And I did bethink me much of Magdalen College, Cambridge, in my time, and how much liquor we did suck in there,

and how little learning, and how I and one HIND, my chamber-fellow,
were solemnly admonished in MR. HILL's chamber by DR. JoHN
Wood, and MR. HILL, in presence of the assembled fellows, for
having been scandalously overserved with drink, as may be read in
the College Register Book to this day. - - - -
But I thank my stars I did leave Cambridge and married .#
wife early, poor, pretty wretch, and did well, thanks to my Lord an
Our Office. So I home, and thinking of the many strange changes
of the times—only Our Office less changed than most things.
Tuesday.—In the Lords a mighty press of strangers, and many
of the Commons House crowding in at the bar, even to sitting on
the floor, to hear his Grace my LoRD DUKE of ARGYLL fire off his
big gun on the Eastern matter, which they do indeed well name the
Eastern Question, for methinks, here at least, 'tis all question and
no answer, and did call attention to the instructions given to my
LoRD MARQUIs of SALISBURY, wherein were two great ends set forth,
the better governing of the Turk; and the securing the peace of
Europe, of which ends by the Duke's showing as yet was not even a
beginning. And so to his indictment, and spoke mighty well and fiery
for an hour and a half, and well listened to; but when all was done
methought there was nothing to answer, his gun being, as it were,
shotted with blank cartridge; as intruth my Lords DERby and SALIs-
BURY and BeaconsPIELD were quick to see and to say, and took as much
time in the saying of their nothing as my LoRD DUKE in the saying of
his, which was pretty to note, and indeed the speakers in the Parlia-
ments of this time do show much more art and grace in the saying
of nothing than they did in my time, only my LoRD DERby did hint
at thereforms promised by the Turk, and how it was but reasonable
to give them time to try to do better, and, Lord, to see how drowning
men will catch at straws when they have nought better to catch at,
for the House did cheer this ºf.
And methought of all I best liked my Lord MARQUIs of SALIs-
BURY when he showed how in Turkey you had nothing to hold to but
the SULTAN, that was afraid to reform matters, and the old Turks,
that were too pig-headed to understand why any reform was wanted,
which methought did go far to dispose of my LoRD DERBY's hope:
and for my part I see nothing for it but the strong hand of the Mus-
covite, that, at least, knoweth his own mind, and putteth, his trust
in his “Bog,” as he calls his god, and keepeth his powder dry, as the
Qld Protector was wont to do, and had he been here methinks
England had known her own mind too, better than she doth, or at
least they that speak for her.
And so I home, with little contentment, save of the brave speaking
about nothing; for there was nothing in the Commons House but talk
of a Small-pox Hospital, built in a scurvy and foul neighbourhood
Limehouse way, where yet I do remember worshipful folk living in
my time. But indeed most things do move westward now-a-days
strangely, save only the Turk, who will not, and as yet I do see
small will to force him, if the Muscovite do not.
Wednesday.—A Bill of one CowPERTEMPLE, for the cutting
down of Officers and Fees in the Ecclesiastical Courts, not, methinks,
before 'tis needed, for, indeed, I do remember these Courts and fees
much cried out upon in my time, when they first grew up again after
the Old Protector's lusty lopping—that I did think then they never
would grow again, and lo they are even now as thriving and thievish,
it seems, as ever. But, at last, it doth seem as if all were come to
be ashamed of them, and MR, CRoss did move the referring of the
Bill to a Select Committee, not, as Select Committees are often used,
for the shelving of the same—but for the making it work to better
purpose. And in such matters all do agree CRoss doth well and
to good purpose. Which pleases me.
en a Bill for the enabling of Scotch tenants to deal with game
that vexeth them, as hares and rabbits—and doth sore consume
their crops, and no wonder they seek to have leave to shoot them,
and methinks will get it, sooner than the same sort in England, your
Scotch being apter to put their heads together, and their heads being
harder, and sending to Parliament men who will work their will—
and seeing the wickedness that comes of poaching—whereof in my
time we heard little or nothing—in these hard and crowding times,
it did seem to me strange to learn that the Game Laws in this
country had grown rather stricter than softer, and methinks should
not be so, if all did their part.
Thursday.-In the Lords, my LoRD BEACONSFIELD, mighty solemn
after his wont, explaining of things loosely said by him on Tuesday
and strange to see how, while seeming to admit his looseness o
speech, he did yet seem to make it out that his loose-speaking was
more to the purpose than other men's closeness. But it appears
that we have been to blamein taking away our consuls from Turkey,
who might have kept our Amb or, informed, and so done
something, if not much, to keep the Turk to better behaviour; and,
indeed, without consuls to serve an ambassador as #. how is he to
see what ses in a wide and waste country like urkey, with no
roads, and no journals or news-writers?
I sore grieved to hear that the Cattle Plague had got in amongst
us once more; and now the steed is stolen, mighty active they all
are in shutting of the stable-door. To-morrow had been fixed for the
adjourned talking about the Eastern Question, but the Commons did
very wisely, as I thought, resolve, to-night, they would have no more
of such idle talking, that serves to no purpose, only to breed bickering.
And I do hope we shall have no more light young fellows girding at
MR. GLADstone, for methinks §§ MAstER CHAPLIN did look
jº foolish to-night, and all thinking of the tongue-basting he
had last week, and had but his deserts, if ever saucy young
Jackanapes had.
I glad to hear that in the carrying out of the great new street
about to be made from Tottenham Court Road (that was indeed a
wide road in my time) to the corner of Charing Cross, the portico of
St. Martin's Church be not to be touched, as the Metropolitan Board
were minded. And indeed though it was built since my time, I do
think it a mighty pretty portico, and one SIR CHRISTOPHER would
have admired, and me pity to lose it in this town, where so
few things pretty.
FROM NILE TO THAMES.
“To offer a present of this sort is to illustrate the romance of riches . . . .
To distribute wealth in a poetical way a man must have a born genius for the
occupation, and it is as difficult to suggest any work of what ARIsTotLE
might have called the “art of expenditure, as it is impossible to withhold
admiration where a great stroke is done. The gift of Cleopatra's needle is
such a stroke, and deserves asthetic approval as well as gratitude.”- The
Saturday Review on MR. ERAsmus Wilson's proposal to remove the Alez-
andria Obelisk to England.
R. PUNCH was in his sanctum
reading his Saturday Review.
A dreamy feeling came over the
Sage, Toby fidgetted, the lamp burned dim, and looking up, Mr.
Punch beheld a Presence! So “the dull cold-blooded CESAR" in
GEROME's picture, lifting his §azº from desk and scroll, meets with
amaze the “bold black eyes,” which had witched world-conquerors
of softer mould than he, and helped so º rid him of
a formidable rival. Mr. Punch is neither dull nor cold-blooded, and
he always bows in courtesy to Beauty... He did so, nºw, .
“Must I introduce myself in form *"murmured that miraculous
voice musically. - -
“Beauty,” nded the Sage, “needs no other introduction
than i.º: . as for form,” — Mr. Punch's admiring regard
completed the sentence. - - - - -
º: know me then?” *: his visitor, with a glow, which
on cheeks less brown and boſd, would have been a blush:
“And acquit MARRANTony of madness,” responded Mr. Punch,
with subtle courtesy. - -
“Since TENNYson met me in that mysterious wood, I have not
Bºth doºdmire

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mr. Punch. “It has served me too well in the present instance.
Judy–Mrs. Punch, is at home. May I have—”
“My curiosity does not extend to her,” quoth the
Enchantress, drily. “Besides, I have business with you.’
“My pages,” said Mr. Punch, apprehensively, “are well sup-
plied; but any contribution from your Majesty would y
“Find its way thither,” interrupted his guest, good-naturedly,
lºs to Mr. Punch's capacious, but yet overflowing, waste-paper
asket. “Its proper destination, doubtless. No ; such women as
I care no more for the pen than for the needle. Leave the one
to the Lydias, the other to the Dorcases; we work with other
weapons. And that is why I object to that obelisk, which I hear
you are about to have transferred hither, being called by so in-
appropriate a name. Cleopatra's Needle, indeed! Fanº, my fame
being associated with the housewife's humble implement!”
“A Cockneyism, doubtless,” replied the Sage. “But nicknames
are the Nemesis of greatness; and slang, like a sapper, respects
nothing and nobody.”
“Precisely,” replied the Serpent of Old Nile, “Yet I look to you
to discountenance, as much as may be, the Cockneyising of this
relic of my rule. Why it should be removed from the vicinity of
Caesar's temple—”
“As in your Majesty's time it was removed from the temple of
the god Tum,” interpolated Mr. Punch, Pº.
“Ah, yes!” sighed the Queen, sadly. “Who can contend with
Time and Change P From Heliopolis to the Thames Embankment
is a far cry. Tum was the god of the Setting Sun, and the sun of
Qld Egypt has long since set. . What destiny JoubRET, Gosch EN,
& Co. and the Engineers will make for New Egypt who shall say?
r. º; least it is not likely to have another CLEOPATRA,” said Mr.
tºnch.
“The prudes, and the political economists would say, “So much
the better l'. Eh P’’ queried the Queen.
“Well—they might,” admitted Mr. Punch.
“O my life
In Egypt! 0 the dalliance and the wit,
The flattery and the strife I’”
murmured CLEOPATRA, as if to herself.
“Well,” said the Sage, reflectively, “GoRDON_PAsHA is not
exactly a ‘mailéd Bacchus,' perhaps, and Egyptian Bonds are now
suggestive of something other than the imprisoning arms of CLEO-
PATRA, though to many a modern ANTONY they may have proved
almost as fatal.”
“‘Contented there to die,’”quoted the Queen, for sole response to
this subtle insinuation. “ W. well, times change, ERASMUS
WILSON doubtless means well, and even the unromantic Saturday
Review seems to see poetry in his project. I confess I do not. But
at any rate, dear Mr. Punch”—the Sage bowed and blushed—“letus
hope that all the poetry will not evaporate in the process of carrying
it out. You islanders are so Boeotian, and so blundering, in monu-
mental matters especially.” The Sage blushed again, but from quite
another emotion. “Don’t let Cockney Edilism wholly vulgarise my
obelisk, and pray reserve your “aesthetic approval’ until it is proved
to be deserved, lest CLEOPATRA's curse be as potent as Minerva's, and
ERASMUS—
“‘With ERAtosTRATUs and ELGIN shine,
In many a branding page, and burning line.’”
“Well, the cases are perhaps somewhat different,” quoth Mr.
Punch, “but your Majesty may trust me to keep my eyes on the
Monolith—if ever I have the good fortune to set them there, and i
I see any signs of a good gift being badly disposed of, be sure Mr.
Punch will play the F. of BYRoN's minatory Pallas, and proba-
bly with more practical effect than even angered divinity produced.”
“Ah, ten thousand thanks!” ejaculated the Queen, in a gush of
maddening melody, and making play with her “piercing orbs,” in a
fashion which so startled that most prudent of preuz chevaliers, Mr.
Punch, that he-awoke, and found the fire out, and Judy in elegant
#. standing before him, evidently primed with an eloquent
eremlad.
Egyptian
The Ministerial Fix.
THE cruz, when Turk and Tartar quarrel,
And Turk seeks succour ministerial,
Is that material aid's immoral,
And moral aid is immaterial.
A Questionable Title.
WHEN we read in the Athenaeum that it was the Poet Laureate
who gave MR. KNowLEs the title of his new periodical, The Nine-
teenth Century—to which Punch wishes all success—one can't help
remembering how the Poet Laureate has characterised that century,
in Maud, as the
“Wretchedest age since the world began.”
BISHOPS ON THE STAGE.
(A Suggestion to the Worthy and Liberal DR. FRASER.)
E have lately seen a real
live Bishop on the
Stage, speaking to the
best purpose, and most in the
spirit of the character, as a
mouth-piece, of good, sense,
sound morals, and Christian
charity. Among various other
objections to the Ballet but
too well-founded, the Lawn-
Lord of Manchester animad-
verted on the brevity of the
Ballet Girls' skirts," which,”
had he wanted an illustration,
he might have said, “were no
longer than a Bishop's apron.”
If the word of a Bishop goes
far, how far would
a Bishop's act go?
As one Bishop
has ventured on
the Stage, why
shouldn't a dozen,
why shouldn't the
entire hierarchi-
cal strength of
- - the Establishment
step out and give us a Ballet of º: with their aprons properly
licensed by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN ? here’s a novelty for anyen-
terprising Manager! The Alhambra Company might, go in for it, or
Mr. John HollingsHEAD might find an opening for them. The sººne
would be simple, representing the exterior of an old Qathedral and the
entrances to the cloisters, something like what one knows in Roberto
or Favorita. A bench on which Bishops are discovered, seated. In
the centre a view of some lawn, with Bishops playing at bowls,
described in the programme as “a bowl of Bishop.” Some are
playing lawn-tennis. To them enter archly an º É.
a pastoral on his pipe, and followed by a crowd of Colºnial Bishops
dancing gaily. The Colonial Bishops woo the other Bishops, who are
seated coyly on the Bench. To these enter Rural Deans, with ribands,
pipe and tabor: º start on seeing their rivals the Colonials. -
he º: º rise from the Bench, and implore the
opposing parties to keep the peace. -
º #. Deans defy their rivals, and, after several futile
charges on the part of the Colonial Bishops, the latter are defeated,
and, flying in confusion, trip up on the peal of an organ which has
been carelessly left about, and leap from various heights of imagina-
tion into the See of Canterbury, when the scene changes, discovering
a Perpetual Curate seated in a car drawn by Prebendaries, while,
Precentors, as outriders, and young Wergers, crowned and playing
on timbrels, are passing under a Triumphal Arch-deacon.
There might be a ğ. for some charitable object at the doors'
of the theatre, and on the play-bill might be printed a copy of what
a Bishop would have said, had there been a sermon. “The whole
to conclude” with a Grand Archidiaconal Function; and (for this
*-
if|occasion only) a
Most BRILLIANT DISPLAY of RocBETs' | |
YOUTH AND AGE.
“YouTH will be served.” A sporting maxim sage,
- Sweeter to adolescence than to age.
Yet CHAPLIN must have known of many a case
Where aged clippers, famous once for pace,
On their own ground whipped weedy youngsters hollow,
Leading where Screws who challenged dared not follow.
If Youth could, as Youth fain would, be severe,
Old age, indeed, might have fair cause to fear;
But Youth that’s raw as rash, unsinewed, slow,
Mayfind with Age the pace it cannot go. ... "
The gods love generous Greenness, but scarce smile
On impotence because ’tis puerile;
Or cheek because ’tis callow. Fine, in truth,
To hear glib HAMILTON, in verdant youth, .
Gird at ripe Age, that’s game to give it weight,
And a i. beating. Tipsters, too elate
When Youth and Age cºntend, before you wage,
'Twere well to know what Youth, and whose the Age!
“Youth will be served " Why, yes, when Youth is stout;
But feeble Youth may chance to bé-served out:

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A FAIR OFFER, AND AN AMENDE HONORABLE.
My Good CoMRADE PUNCH,
EE, I hold out
the hand of
friendship
across the
terrible sea.
The “perfect
gentleman's-
ridére” of
France soli-
cits “lesport.
mans" of
England.
Paris greets
London. The
Sport of the
British Is-
lands is ac-
knowledged
§ le sport of
the great
French na-
tion. This
will be histo-
rical.
You will
ask why do
I, a perfect
Parisian, a
flán eur, a
frequenter
of cafés, a
reader of
journals—
wny do
write to you? Is it because I love London with its “Leicester
Squarr,” its “Vauxhall-bridge Road,” its “Newe Cut” (you see, I
know my London to the bottom); is it because I love London? No.
a thousand times, no. Is it because I love you English, “with your
| “roast-beefs,” your “plum-puddings,” your “Sundays,” your
London-fogge? No. The sun cannot love the mud. Bel esprit ean-
not from the heart embrace barbarism. Then if I do not love either
you or your country, why do I write P Because there is one bond
| of union between us—le sport.
Yes, Punch, my good friend, it is because we both love to follow
the artful rabbit with knives of the chase, both love to shoot the fox,
both loye to watch the artful partridge in his stand, that we frater-
nise. It is this grand passion, absorbing, absolute, irrepressible,
| that binds us one to the other. In its presence, we have ceased to be
two Europeans, a Frenchman and an Englishman, a leader of art,
- .. and culture, and a shopkeeper, and we have become “perfect
gentlemans-ridéres.” Le sport has given us relations of liberty, fra-
ternity, and—strongest of all—equality. As the Americans would
*f; —“we stand on the same platform.”
t is because this Brotherhood of le sport is threatened, that
I now write to you. Your Jockey Club would put restraints
on the horses of France running in your Epsom-Derbe. Why?
Because, they say it is not just to call a five-year-old a three-year-
old. How! It seems that the honour of the greatest nation in the
world is questioned. Were it not that Alsace, and Lorraine are
thirsting to be liberated, were it not that the Rhine has yet to be
rescued, were it not that we are patiently waiting to be ºfed by
our grandchildren, this insult should be washed out in blood! But
no, for a time we bear all. And thus we will send our matured
three-year-olds to your race-courses until you stopus. Let it be
clearly understood a Frenchman's word is doubted when he is told
that his horse that has won this three-year-old stake counts
five years. To doubt a man's word is to insult him. And yet the
Frenchman, in spite of insults, doubts and equivoques, will still
retain the nomenclature of the race-horse, will still win with what
ou call five-year-old horses what you call three-year-old races.
hy? ... Because France is the greatest nation in the world, because
everything must be sacrificed for France! The grand thought that
lies at the bottom of our triumphs of le sport can only be appreciated
by a leader of civilisation, by a philosopher, by a poet—in one word,
by a Frenchmanl
With this idea in my mind, Punch, then I make my proposal to
you. Instead of refusing to allow Frenchmen to win your horse-
races by certificates, which you dare to T. open to them a
new field of honour on the Tide as well as on the Turf. Your
ADMIRAL. Rous is not only a “perfect-Gentlemans-ridere,” he is
also (by his profession) a “Yahotsman.” Let him arrange a regatta
between England and France. In a week or so the great Oxfor-
Cambrig-Boating-Race will be rowed at Putne.
France be represented You ask for the conditions. They are
soon suggested. Here they are:—
1. A Prize of 200,000,000 francs to be given to the winning
crew.
2. The money for this purpose to be found entirely by England.
b * The English crews to consist (as heretofore) of eight men per
08w.
4. The French crew to consist of sixteen men per boat.
5. The English crews to row in ordinary outriggers.
6. The French crew to row in a steam-launch, propelled by the
most powerful engines.
T. The French crew to have ten minutes' start.
8. The umpire, and all the other officials in the race, to be
Frenchmen.
There, Punch, my excellent comrade, agree to these terms, and
you will find fair France as triumphant on the River, as she is
already victorious on the Race Course.
Receive my considerations, the most distinguished.

I HAVE no idea of writing a Novel. I don't know how to do it;
and fear I could not M.; in telling a story if I tried: the idea,
I|therefore, is very formidable to me."
I will suppose myself to be narrating facts to an individual, and
to be saying all I could think off to induce him to lend his utmost
aid in remedying the great evil which we all deplore; and I will
write, so far as I can, fjust as I would speak to you, Sir (the Editor,
for example, or the gentle Readers), if you were º; by my
side. If you, or he, were so sitting, while he was sitting I would
lay" sundry papers before him, or you, Sir, in confirmation of my
opinions and statements, so that you or he might know for himself
how absolutely true they are. -
Herewith I send you photographs of maps, ships, charts, tables
of wrecks, models of yessels, working models of shipwrecks, plans
of the coasts, statistical tables, and photographs of entries in
LLoyd's books. , You have only got to refer to these from time to
time, and hand them over to the Artist who may undertake to
illustrate my Novel.”
Now, Sir, I sound the last bell, and all for shore must leave the
vessel, as one must draw the load-line somewhere. Those who
remain will be careful not to speak to the man who has at his heart
the common weal of our Seamen, while all his hands are engaged on
the present thrilling work. Heave ahead, my braye boys | Now
we sail with the gale to the Bay ºf Biscay, oh! and we meet after
the voyage. Steam up, and away! S. PL-Ms-LL., M.P.
CHAPTER I.-The Right of Challenging the Stevedore.
Those who are acquainted with the maritime town of the ancient
Cinque Port of Newport-Pagnell, will not need me to remind them
of its coasts white with . its sands crowded with tourists, its
gay quay thronged with sailors of all nations, with mariners from
the four quarters of the Qld World and from various parts of the
New ; its host of Jew-pedlars, with their wares, decoying maidens

ment of a pamphlet. But the º was a very powerful one nevertheless.

ment augurs extremely well for the Novel.-ED.

to “Buy, buy, buy l’’, while bewitching, bright-eyed girls are
enticing their admirers, fresh from sea, with pockets full of gold, to
bestow on them the shining trinkets and gorgeous gewgaws brought
by the trayelling hucksters from the stalls of the Lowther Arcade.
Bands of music were playing at intervals on the jetty; excursion
steamers were ...; and arriving; church bells were ringing
for sailors' marriages; church bells were tolling for sailors' funerals;
flags were flying in honour of the Port-Admiral's birthday; and the
guns of the harbour were firing salutes to celebrate the coming of
age of the youngest Brother of the Elder Brethren.
Gay and animated was the scene, as the good merchant ship, the
Albert Ross (owners GR0GBLOSSOM & Co., East Sheen), lay alongside
in the basin, taking in its cargo for Nova Dizzembla and the Pharo
lslands on the Coast of º
The pier was absolutely hidden from sight, º the enor-
mous sacks of wheat, each marked with the words “Corney Grain,”
in bold relief, and partly by huge cases containing German reeds.
A number of men, under the command of a Captain, who was
only seventeen years old," were rapidly cutting the vessel above-
named in two, so as to lengthen her fore and aft, and thus enable
her to carry more grain than she was ever intended to carry, and so
enrich the coffers of her proprietors. It should be Coffers v. Coffins.
By the eyening the Albert Ross would be ready to carry that enor-
mous freight that I have described as lying on the pier, but would
she be seaworthy? And if unseaworthy, was there a law or a lawyer
in England to prevent her sailing out of Newport-Pagnell harbour?
As an inducement to men to volunteer for service on the Albert
Ross, a large placard was affixed to the mast, on which was written

Ross should carry all the cargo brought down to that pier, he had
ordered all hands to add fifty feet amidships, but positively refused
to give the vessel the requisite number of knees. Qf course, as eve
one knows, there should be a knee to each foot, and this was omitted,
so that whatever result chance might ordain for the vessel, its going
out of port must be but a very lame affair, after all.
One man alone, as we ji see presently, knew of the all, but
certainly fatal consequences of this recklessness, and he kept it to
himself. If ever there was a villain on this earth and its neigh-
bourhood, it was this man, to whom the reader (with this prefatory
apology for bringing him into such execrable company) will be
presently introduced.
It had been found utterly impossible to accommodate such a cargo
either in the Aula di San Giorgio (owners JonATHAN WILDE & Co.),
or on board the Danish trading vessel called The Saucy Polly
Teknik, which had just discharged its freight of Pepper, and was
now bound for the Dizolvon Wuzen Isles. -
Standing on the edge of the quay, the rude breeze freely passing
through her locks without paying any toll, stood MARY MAYBUD,
the lovely daughter
of the Junior War-
den of the Cinque
Ports.
Behind her stood
her father, the Ju-
nior Warden him-
self, as thorough a
specimen of the bluff
wicked old sea-dog
as ever spliced a
maindeck or hauled
a keel athwart-
ships, on a dirty
night in the Bay of
Biscay.
He was looking
earnestly through a
telescope, which his
daughter supported
over her left shoul-
der, while her right
hand was in
front of the glass,
thus to a certain ex-
tent obscuring the
view.
“I can't make
out the rig of that
vessel in the offing!”
exclaimed the rough
old Salt, as he closed
one eye and shut the
other, and then ap-
plied both in turn

asked the Junior
Warden, rapping
out an oath.
“WILLIAM TAILLEUR,” she replied, º:
The Junior Warden threw down the telescope violently, then
dashed his Yºlº down on the stones.
“Never!” he exclaimed, furiously; “never!”
“Papa,” implored his daughter, “do not speak thus! See, you
are attracting a crowd.”
But the old man was not to be pacified. He had a magnificent match
for his daughter in his eye, and he would not hear of her marrying
WILLIAM TAILLEUR, a mere eighteen-pence-an-hour boatman. .
A crowd was indeed approaching from the town, cheering lustily.
A brass band walked in front, and several people carried flags.
“See!” cried the Junior Warden, “your affianced husband, my Co-
owner, the man of my choice, has already arrived. Belay! he comes!”
MARY shuddered, and the tears rose to her eyes as a dark and far
from unhandsome man, whose eagle nose and piercing black eyes,
#. from under his well-defined brows, bespoke, even if his
ess had not, the Spanish Don, advanced from among his enthusiastic
followers and gracefully knelt on one knee before her. -
A round black cap was set jauntily on the short-cropped dark hair
which, with short mutton-chop whiskers, formed an artistic set off
to his sallow skin, purple lips, and shaven face.
He wore a short, ric Yº. and embroidered jacket, a scarf
wound round him like a belt, knee-breeches highly ornamented with

hen went up an English hoorah from the open-mouthed and
open-hearted populace of Newport-Pagnell as they cried—
“Long live Don José DI Nosí, the Stevedore of Salamancal ''
It was indeed the celebrated Stevedore who had sought the hand
of the fair MARY MAYBUD, daughter of Old GREGoRY GRogBLossom,
the Junior Warden of the Cinque Ports.” At this moment a splashing
of oars attracted the attention of those on the quay ; a boat was
rapidly approaching. It touched the quay. A ſº young fellow,
full of mirth and full of spree, leapt on shore, splashing the people
in the boat with an oar, and roaring with iaughter.
“'Tis hel” exclaimed MARY MAYBUD, “my WILLIAMTAILLEUR!”
The Stevedore arose from his knees, scowling.
WILLIAM touched his hat gaily to the Junior Warden, who how-
ever returned his salute with a severe look and a direct question.
“Where have you been P”
“Taking a charter-party out for a row,” was the ready answer.
Then he continued, “ 3. promised me the hand of MARY MAYBUD
when I was earning my own livelihood. I am doing so now. I
claim the fulfilment of your word.” -
The Junior Warden turned almost purple with suppressed rage.
“Never! Never!!” he exclaimed, as he turned on his heel.
“ Ho y d6s he gohon so?” exclaimed the Stevedore, bitterly.
WILLIAM approached the Spaniard, with his hand outstretched.
MARY interposed, beseechingly.
It was too late. WILLIAM TAILLEUR would be heard, and the
crowd shouted for him, loudly, “BILLY! BILLY!”
* If you please, Sir, if GREGoRY GRogBLossom was MARY's father, why
was her name MAYBUDP-ED.
Dear Sir, this story is founded on Fact. Let that suffice, MAYBUD was
her mother's name, and her daughter resumed it, not caring to be called
GRoGBLossom. Wery simple.—S. P
“Hold!” cried WILLIAMTAILLEUR, in a loud and firm voice, which
caused even the Junior Warden to turn and listen. “I claim an Eng-
lishman's undoubted right in any sea-port of the British dominions.”
“What right do you claim P” demanded the Warden.
WILLIAM's answer came back in a clear, ringing voice,
“The Right of challenging the Stevedore ”

DEAR SIR,-You select Newport-Pagnell as the scene of your story. You
describe it (admirably, we admit) as a “maritime town.” Surely, Sir–
though you ought, of course, to have a far more intimate acquaintance with
such matters than we can boast—isn't Newport-Pagnell an inland town, and
in Bedfordshire? We may be wrong, from not being well up in the coast
towns or in the Cinque Ports; but if so, please put us right, and oblige yours,
THE EDITor.

sionally, when not otherwise engaged in abstruse calculations—who cares

Maritime matters generally. Where do my constituents live P_At Derby.

Derby-ites know about “larboard” or “starboard,” or “beam-end,” or
“long-shore,” or “short-shore,” beyond what I tell 'em 2 If I say Newport-
Pagnell's a sea-port, sea-port it is. If I don't know what I'm .# abou
who does? I shall give you what I profess to give you—a Romance founde
on fact. Work this out by all the points of the compass, and you'll find that
Newport-Pagnell ain't to be beaten as a romantic sea-port founded on fact—
“Pagnell” is the romance, “New-port” is the fact. Can't waste any more
time in correspondence, as I must heave a-head. 0 reservoir 1–S. P., M.P.

SLEEP; ITS CAUSES, AND ITS CONSE-
QUENCES.
WHAT shall be done to the driver found sleeping
on his seat? This question came before the Ux-
bridge Police Court one day last week, when—
“CHARLEs CastLB, 15, in the employ of MR. TIMMs,
hay-dealer, Iver-heath, Bucks, was sued for riding asleep
while in charge of a horse and cart at Hillingdon Hill, at
a quarter past two on the morning of the 10th inst. A
fºrtnight ago the defendant was summoned before the Slough
Magistrates for a similar offence, and, as was mentioned in
the ‘Times,” he pleaded that he had been on the road twenty-
four hours. On the present occasion he stated that he went
to London with a horse and cart three nights in the week.
When stopped he was thoroughly erhausted.”
Whose fault was that? The Uxbridge Magistrate
seems to have been not quite sure. A little uncer-
tainty on this point apparently influenced him in
dealing with the culprit, CHARLEs CASTLE.
“The Magistrate fined him ten shillings—five shillings
less than usual at this court, and allowed him a week for
payment, in the hope that his master would give him the
money.”
Thus lightly was let down not exactly an old
offender, being a lad of fifteen, but one whose offence
was a second conviction, following only a fortnight
after the first, with six days out of the fourteen,
however, spent on the road. The Magistrate's .
that in these circumstances CASTLE's master would
give him the money to pay a mitigated fine, may
jº. to imply an idea that he was not himself to
blame for exhaustion from overwork, and consequent
sleep. ... His master, now that he is aware of the
possibility of such a collapse, will of course take care
that it does not occur again; for if it do, the over-
worked driver may not merely tumble in his sleep,
and break his neck, but he may have the misfor-
tune to run over and kill somebody else; and then
there may be not merely a fine of ten shillings, but
the dickens to pay.
“AH! CHE LA MoRTE!”
PERHAPs one source of the alarming increase of the
Cattle Plague, particularly among the older beasts,
may be traced to the Music Publishers. When
such, a lot of tunes appear every week, is it any
wonder that old cows should die off so rapidly?
PARALYSIS IN THE PEAS.
BEwARE how you try the effect of strychnine, prussic acid, or any
other poison, on a rabbit, or a guinea-pig. ave the fear of the
Anti-Wivisection Act before #. eyes. If you want to try experi-
ments with poisons on a living animal try them on yourself.
Should you kill yourself, unintentionally, the law will acquit you
of suicide, as it does not forbid any donkey to experiment on a
donkey.
Suppose, for instance, you want to know what is the effect of
repeated small doses of º: upon the human system, take a frac-
tion of a grain of the sulphate or acetate of that metal once a day
continually till you discover. Ultimately }. will find it produce
paralysis. You will lose the use of your hands or legs, or one side, or
more, of your body. Salts of copper will paralyse you sooner than
even salts of mercury. But you must take them in minute quantities.
In large doses they mostly rid you of themselves—copper acting like
antimony.
In order, to take, 'your copper pleasantly, your best plan will
be to swallow it at dinner-time, daily, along with green peas.
This you can do all the year round, as peas are always to be had
preserved in tins. You can mix your copper with your peas if neces-
sary. . If the peas are of a dull, greyish, faded, ugly colour, there
is probably no copper in them, and you º have to put some. But
when their tint is a beautiful bright green, then you may suspect that
there is plenty of copper in them to cause paralysis if persevered with
sufficiently long. e copper is mingled with the peas to make them
look pretty; and few people seem to be deterred by the fear of poison
from preferring pretty-looking peas to plain ones.
It is F. however, that it may become rather less easy
than it. been heretofore to procure tinned peas, which besides
being tinned are also coppered. Several foreign provision-dealers
have lately been summoned before MR. KNox, and, on medical evi-
dence, fined for selling tinned peas containing copper in dangerous
quantities. As they sold them in ignorance, they have been let off
with nominal fines, but in future vendors of coppered peas may

pay.
Of course the multitude ignorantly eating peas greened with
copper must be, all of them, greener than any peas. Bright green
tinned peas may always be suspected of containing copper. If there
is any question on that, point, it may be summarily, settled by
pouring on the peas a little strong liquid ammonia, which, if copper
is present, will make them turn bluer than even their seller will
look when he is fined fifty pounds. So also with pickles; only the
vinegar of the pickles will require a large excess of ammonia. In case
there is no ammonia or other means at hand of determining whether
the greenness of peas or pickles is owing to copper or no, a philoso-
F. would give cripper the credit of the colour, and himself the

THE WALHALLA OF WAX.
THE Post presents its readers with the subjoined notification
concerning—
“THE LATE CHARLEs DICKENs.-The citizens of Portsmouth having
wished to erect a statue to the late CHARLEs Dick ENs, found themselves met
by the passage in his will to the effect that it was his wish that no statue
should be set up to him after his death. Those, therefore, who wish to see a
counterfeit presentment of the great author, must resort to the galleries of
MADAME Tussaud, where his effigy will be found, modelled with that truth
to nature which characterises the whole of the numerous figures in the great
galleries in Baker Street.”
In vain do men of genius and greatness desire to deny themselves
sthumous glorification. The illustrious fellow-townsman of the
ortsmouth people could succeed in preventing them from adorning
their city with a statue in honour of him, and also in hindering
the erection of any such memorial in Westminster, Abbey. The
ublic at large have felt respect for his will to be the best tribute to
is memory. But let nobody who has made himself illustrious in
literature, or any other line of excellence, expect to keep his image
out of MADAME TUSSAUD's. That Walhalla, or Pantheon, is inevi-
table for him at any rate; thither, in effigy, will he, mill he, he
goes; mark you that. All he can hope for is a pedestal decently
remote from the Chamber of Horrors, and from such personages of
distinction as, the “Claimant; ” for “in the great galleries in

MUSIC MADE VISIBLE.
To the wonders of the Deep, at the Westminster Aquarium,
another wonder has been added, which may rather be described as
a wonder of the Shallow, or at least the Superficial. This new
wonder is announced as “A Vision of Music;" and the wonder of
it is that any one should fancy that music can be visible. A concert
among fish-tanks seems a trifle out of place. The sweetest sounds
one might expect there would be, perhaps, the sounds of cod-fish.
But what would be the utterance of the jºi of BEETHovKN, on
hearing one of his finest Symphonies – the lovely, ever-living
“Pastoral”—performed in an Aquarium, to the accompaniment of
a Panoramal - - - --- - - -
Suppose the “Vision” is successful, will imitators copy it? If
pictures may be shown to accompany a lººphº , why may not
music be performed to accompany a picture? If panoramas can
be painted to illustrate BEETHovKN, why should not tunes be
introduced to give a tone to a WANDYKE, or a RUBENs, or a RAFFAELLE *
What a happy thought for the R. A.'s at their next winter Exhi-
bition! Let a German Band be hired to attend each batch of
visitors, and play appropriate music in their Fººt round the
rooms. Or let a barrel-organ stand in front of each Old Master,
whom the Council may think suited for musical illustration, and
grind appropriate airs while the connoisseurs look on.
That’s Flat 1
IN the Daily News we observe an advertiser announces this want:
A FLAT WANTED (where there are other Flats) in a good part of
London, &c.
My dear Sir, in the very best parts of town you may readily meet
with any number of Flats. But perhaps it is a Widow who makes
the announcement. One at a time, Madam, or some of the Flats
might become too sharp!

overwhelming, should have been able to reduce to more than normal

in some degree owing to the subject he treats, but may, with more
confidence, be attributed to his manner of treating it.
If anything could make the Turks more odious in the eyes of
England, if not of Europe, it would be the untoward circumstance
that their cause should have fallen into the hands of a nobleman, in

so persistent, as those revealed in EARL GREY's views upon the
Eastern Question. -
The EARL of DERBY, however, glad of toleration however tedious,
and support however eccentric, expressed himself sensible of the
candour of LoRD CAMPBELL, and grateful for the dispassionateness
of EARL GREY. He did his best to add to the weight of dulness
under which the House of Lords had already succumbed.
The Celtic vivacity of the DUKE of ARGYLL, with which I am
more prepared than most to sympathise, was insufficient to relieve
the weight which had settled upon the little that was left of this
august assemblage, when, at half-past eight o'clock, the House
divided, leaving my LoRD CAMPBELL AND STRATHEDEN, the solitary
supporter of his own Motion, in an assemblage of four. - -
England may with reason be grateful to its Peerage, which gives
this grave lesson to wordiness without wisdom, and crotchetiness
without consistency. For any other Essence to be extracted from
the incidents of this evening's debate in the Lords I seek in vain.
Nor do I find it more easy:to reduce, within the limits to which I
am, for the present, confined, the desultory.conversation which
to-night occupied the House of Commons, till the order of the day
was read for going into Committee of supply. -- -
Some may find in this brief and often futile interchange of
remarks, on a vast variety of topics, evidence of the ubiquitous
vigilance of the Commons. I see in it, rather, an obliviousness of
the limits which separate a Parish Westry from a Parliament, and
of the bounds within which that Legislature should confine itself,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
which admits the finality of Man's strength and Member's energy.
Yet I am bound to recognise the politeness of Ministers in answer-
ing questions, not seldom indiscreet, and in most cases superfluous;
while I admire the skill with which such }. when incon-
venient, may be evaded, under the pretext of answering them.
Before the discussion of the Civil Service Estimates, for the intro-
duction of which thus early in the Session much credit must be
assigned to Ministers, or rather the Departments over which they
nominally preside, MR. GoLDSMID called attention to the want of a
proper explanation of an expenditure for pacific purposes, the rise of
which from £4,000,000 in 1852, to close upon £22,000,000 in the present
year, is calculated to arrest, the attention of even the most unthink-
ing. MR. W. H. SMITH, than whom no one can better know the
importance of a good system of account-keeping, admitted the
desirableness, while he seemed to doubt the º of such
an explanation. The House then proceeded to its desultory
criticism of Estimates, which it is id: to assail without study,
and hopeless to diminish by independent objection.
Tuesday (Lords). — The LoRD CHANCELLoR moved the Second
i. of a Bill which, in my time, would have been unnecessary,
to enable the MASTER of THE Rolls to make provision for the de-
struction "..." documents. Such provision was then made by
the means taken for the nominal preservation of such documents.
But the reign of rats over records, so longjuncontested, is now, I
learn, at an end for ever. The present Bill provides all needful
precautions that no documents should be destroyed whose preserva-
tion can either interest the public or enlighten the historian.
(Commons.)-The same desultory multifariousness, to which my
yesterday's report directed attention, was the characteristic of the
earlier part of this evening's misemployment. Butan interest was at
length given to discussion, by the attempt of MR. C. LEwis, an active
member of the inferior branch of the legal profession, to transfer
from English to Irish hands the management of the income and
}. of the Irish Society, which now administers estates in
ndonderry producing, a net rental of £12,700 a year.
That this property is held by the Irish Society for public purposes
must be admitted; that the expenditure of £4,500 a year, under
the head of “Management and refreshment,” by a body drawn
from the Corporation of the City of London, is expenditure for a
public purpose, may be open to question; particularly when the sum
spent on refreshmentis not distinguished from that spenton manage-
ment. But a large and liberal hospitality has ever been the cha-
racteristic of our Metropolitan Municipality, and I am free to own
that I feel satisfaction # thinking #. this characteristic, so far
from declining, has gathered intensity with the advancing years
of the Corporation; that their dinners are now more sumptuous and
succulent than. they were in my own time, and their wines not
inferior in quality. ... I have yet to learn why hospitalities, so grace-
fully and liberally dispensed by the managers of the Irish Society of
London, should be transferred to a body of Irish entertainers, who
if not less liberal, would certainly be less cultivated in the arts of
the table; nor has our experience of Irish local administration
been of a character to plead for its extension. Not that I feel
much sympathy, with the worthy member for Peterborough, who
sees in the Irish Society the one effective bulwark in Ireland
against the invasions of Papal authority, which in his eyes are
as ubiquitous as malignant. I fail, however, to find in MR. LEwis's
indictment of the Society that force which alone would justif
such a large transfer of the duties of administration combined wit
entertainment to an Irish body, even of those Northern counties, in
which an infusion of the penuriousness of the Scot has checked the
natural open-handedness of the Celtic race. Much stress was laid on
the good works of the Society; much, too, on the part they had taken
in resisting the rights of their lawful Sovereign during the siege
of Derry, a page of our annals in which I, for one, find but little
satisfaction. I cannot regret that the Motion was rejected by 108 to 53.
It was with more gratification that I listened to the discussion on
MR. SAMUELson's Motion for a Select Committee to inquire into the
system of apprenticeship of pupil–teachers in elementary schools
and of training colleges for elementary teachers. Having myself
kept an academy for the instruction of youth, this is a subject on
which I feel entitled, however reluctantly, to assert myself as an
authority. LoRD SANDON defended, MR FAwcETT assailed, the
existing system, both with plausible arguments. That there are
priná facie grounds of inquiry, however, MR. W. E. FoastER, a
candid and well-informed judge on this subject, admitted, and
the facts, as stated, seem to me to show. The refusal of the House
to sanction the Motion, by 46 to 104, must be taken rather as a
proof of power in the Government than of cogency in the reasoning
of its organs. - -
Wednesday.—The desire of husbands to marry their deceased
wives' sisters I have always regarded as a compliment to the
deceased wives, and the result of a natural desire to escape at least
one mother-in-law. i do not admit thear ent against such unions
founded on the Old Testament. That the law in England and its
Colonies should differ on this P. is a blot I should not regret to
see removed. . But it is one of many such blots; and I doubt the
wisdom of doing it away by a side-wind; all the more as any incon-
venience with respect to the transmission of landed property—its
sole. practical inconvenience—can be avoided by the simple pre-
caution of making a will., I cannot, therefore, feel satisfaction in
even the temporary triumph of MR.KNATCHBULL-HugessRN's Motion
declaring valid in the º: Country, marriages with deceased
wives' sisters, contracted by domiciled Colonists, in Colonies where
such marriages have been legalised. Nor can Iregret that to-night's
triumph .# be neither of long duration nor of practical effect.
Thursday (Lords):-I rejoiced to learn, from the conversation
between my Lords BELMoRE and CARNARvoN, that the disgraceful
ractice of kidnapping natives of the South Sea Islands—whose
iscovery we owe to my excellent and humane friend, CAPTAIN
Cook—has been reduced to the narrowest limits by the watchfulness
of our cruisers in the Southern seas. Slavery, while it existed, may
have enlisted in its behalf much reason as º as some philanthropy.
But in defence of this abominable practice of kidnapping the rea-
soner is as silent, as the philanthropist is loud in its condemnation.
(Commons.)—After a more warm than well-informed philological
discussion between SIR GEORGE CAMPBELL, and Loßd GeoRGE
HAMILTON on the etymology of HER MAJESTY's Indian Title, in which
I longed to raise a lexicographical and authoritative voice, I
confess to having sought the natural, relief of slumber, under
the influence of a, tedious discussion of the Prisons Bill. To this
I yielded with the less reluctance, when I had once satisfied
myself that the excellent provisions of the Bill are in no real
danger, either from the obstinacy of bucolic prejudice, the claims
of parochial self-importance, or the penetrating insidiousness of
local jobbery.
GO-AHEAD SPELLING REFORM.
LoNDoN School-Board
have been favoured
by the advice of MR.
PAMINoNDAs EzRA
SPRY on the ques-
tion, now under their
consideration, of
“Spellin Reform.”
There, he says, is an
instance of that Re-
form to begin with
Fº s elli, H for
spe - e re-
ºf: that or-
thographical reform
should be based upon popular
pronunciation. It is only the
Upper Ten,” who affect to talk
fine, that, say “spelling.”, The
masses on both sides of the Atlantic
drop the “g” from that word, and
pronounce it “spellin.” He
thinks it may be a question
whether the aspirates which the
million commonly also ... at
least in this country, sho d be
omitted also: “ham,” for instance
being reduced to “am,” and
“hand” to “and.” But this rule,
he fears, would breed some confusion of meaning and of parts
of, speech. As to certain aspirates, too, there is, he remar
a diversity of usage. By some of the People “horse” is prong
“oss,”, by others “hoss.” He would not himself say “old oss,”
but “old hoss,”, in addressing a Prince, for example, or a Peer, or a
Bishop. And this illustration leads him to a further development
of his notion, of “Spellin Reform,” which, ought, he contends, to
include all, the improvements of “spellin” effected by America
writers, of late years, in the literature of the United States, -
º R. SPRY proposes that in the “spellin” of all such
words, as “defence,” “offence,” and “pretence” the “c” should
be replaced with “s,” as it is by the most remarkable writers in his
ºwn country, who, agree in “spellin” those words “offense,”
... pretense”. and “defense,” on etymologigal grounds, because
“s” occurs instead of “c” in the roots they are àerived from as
printed in all “dixonarys” and books whatsoever in the Latin
“langwidge.” On derivative grounds, also, he would have the
superfluous “u” ejected from all such nouns as “honour” and
: colour,” those words to be spelt “honor” and “color;” and
& 4 ºr." for conformity's sake, “neighbor,” or, bettér still,
“naibor.” -
The difficulty of effecting these reforms of “spellin” will be,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR, SPRY fears, “considerable some.” He knows how averse English
writers of any authority are to adopt American ameliorations and
enrichments of English. He is highly indignant that all the higher
portion of the British Press eschew that expressive and elegant
adjective, “reliable,” and persist in using that obsolete verb “to
lend” instead of its modern American synonym, “to loan.”. He
expects that an aristocratic fastidiousness will set them as obsti-
*...hº. every, attempt, at, advancement in the path of
“Spellin Reform,” and especially of “goin ahead” under the Star-
Spangled Banner. His only hope for English “Spellin, Reform.”
lies in the creation of a demand for it among the People, who, if
they wanted it, could, by means of intimidation meetings, such as
...i. Square and Hyde Park demonstrations, pretty soon
succeed in forcing it upon an unwilling Legislature.
MRS, GRUNDY ON THE BOIL.
QH, Mr. Punch '...The thin end of another wedge in 1. The
Colonial Marriages Bill! But it must soon be out again. Or else
we shall shortly have marriage with deceased wives sisters legalised
altogether. Shocking !
How can people argue that what is lawful in the Australian
Colonies, ought to be lawful here! Are not the Australians the
Antipodes? And does not common sense show that things in
England are the reverse of those on the opposite side of the globe
So that what is very wrong here, is perfectly right there, with a
few exceptions, such as robbery, murder, &c.
And then how stupid to say, that because Australian laws have
been assented to by the Crown, the Royal assent might just as well
be given to the same laws for England! The contrary stands to
reason... d what an absurd question to ask—“Suppose the
Australian Marriage Acts wrong, the Crown having sanctioned them
because they are Colonial, and suppose the Australians were to turn
Mormonites, and legalise plurality of wives, would not the Crown
be equally bound to sanction polygamy P” Of course not.
Logic is a gem, Sir, and fair-play a jewel, and hypocrisy a par-
ticular detestation to your ever moral, conscientious, and sincere
MARTHA GRUNDY.
P.S.–I am nobody's deceased wife's sister; but I scorn the
insinuation that I uphold restrictions on marriage as well as every-
thing else which affects other people only, and not myself.
Canine Devotion.
WE read, in a recent number of the Times, an advertisement-
RETRIEVER DOG STRAYED into the Chancery Pay-Office,
Chancery Lane, on Saturday, the 17th inst., &c.
Was this the dog of some luckless party to a Chancery suit, who
had gone in to retrieve his master's fortune? The word “strayed”
seems superfluous. . As if any intelligent man, much less any
sagacious animal, who knew where he was going, ever went, into
Chancery!

No. Four, not to be outdone by the dashing stroke of
the Captain of the boat, has started a powerful stroke of
his own, which caresses No. Five's back in a manner
more remarkable as a sensation than sensational as an
improvement on his old style. However, he probably
imagines that, by getting over this style, he has dis-
covered a new field for invention.
No. Three is much to be complimented on the graceful
turn of the wrist he has adopted, which produces the
maximum of style with the minimum of work. Nothing
can be more elegant or less useful.
No. Two, sticks to his work, though he appears to
quarrel with his sliding-seat—a continuation of which
uneasiness may cause his work to stick to him. The §
fault we find is that he works out of the boat, whic
probably accounts for his sewing-machine action when
rowing.
Bow has every right to the title, for no one of the crew
bends his head more assiduously than No. One. If there
is an objection to his performances, it is a tendency to
catch the water, which occasionally sends him back with
his legs in the air. But this is a weakness he will soon
get over.

on a
Lock to Ditton Corner, halting for an hour at the “Plough,” opposite Nuneham
House, where hot º brought creaming out in glasses, and partaken
of by the Coaches, which had been driven down by the Proctors on duty. Great
as was the temptation offered to the Crew, the seductive drink was nobl
refused by all except an “odd man,” whose stamina could not be º
since he had rowed at the bow thwart.
A game of billiards was started, to improve the finish of the stroke, and the
lookers-on were much struck by the feather of No. Seven.
The rowing to-day might have been more, satisfactory. . Most of the men
put their backs well into the boat, but persist in leaving their legs outside.
No. Eight has a good swinging lurch forward, and comes well over his
toes, but his hair is not parted down the middle, and, consequently, there is a
tendency to heel over.
No. Six is brisk, and catches the water in his hat when Seven throws it
well up, but he is too much occupied with his eye-glass, which must add
weight, and would be better left in his rooms,
No. Five displays perhaps the best form, his muscles standing out like loaves
upon a baker's tray... We should recommend him still to take a little more fat
down. This he might readily manage by eating bacon for breakfast.
At Baitsbite Lasher the Coaches, who happened to be
close, took the Eight in tow, and, putting on a spurt,
they paddled home at the rate of sixty-four to the
minute, breaking three oars and losing an outrigger, but
without turning a hair.
In the evening the Crew dined at the “Scout and
Bedmaker,” where the repast consisted of the various
crustaceans º by No. One, washed down with tawny
old University Port at twenty-seven shillings the dozen.
The pace was everything that could be desired.
We have said enough for any one with half an §.
(unless the diminished optic is of glass), to detect the
winner; and, as the Boat Race of '77 is to be rowed at
half-past five in the morning, by gas-light and the
Limes at Mortlake, there is no doubt that the crowd
assembled will be one of the gayest and most cheerful of
the coming season, and only too ready to accept any
suggestions which may lead to prospective pools or
impending dozens of kid gloves.

THE DREAM OF THE BRITISH BUTCHER.
ELATE at the state of his trade and his tills,
The Butcher mused on a batch of long bills
In a mood that may well be described as Elysian,
For prices ranged high, and thermometers low
So the Butcher droused, and in Dreamland's glow
Beheld an astonishing vision:
A Bull of a breed that was utterly new
To that Butcher's experience, burst on his view. ..
It was starred, it was striped, it was dotted and lined
In a fashion fantastic, which brought to the mind
The sketches for carvers in Cookery ks,
Qr sartorial aids to self-measurement. “Oh!”
Cried that Butcherman crossly, “this certainly looks
Like º: it down very low "–
(For that Bull was priced over in numerals plain,
And, turtle-like, ticketed ere it was slain)–
“This practice is perfectly odious!
“What! Sixpence a pound?' 'Tis too much for my brain.”
(Here the Bull gave a bellow melodious.)
“Who the dickens are you?” snarled the Butcher, “who come
With preposterous prices to puzzle and pain us?”
Said the Bull, with a wink, “Wall, I’m known, when to-hum,
As Bos Americanus.”
“Oho! ” yelled the Butcher, “that much-talked-of Yankee
That’s ºf to cut down our profits f No, thankee.
I’m boss of this business, and mean, if I can,
To iº traditional prices.” -
Quoth the Bull, through his nose—“I don't doubt you, old
man,
But you’re hardly awake to this Crisis of Crises.
Smart trick of those canny Scotch fleshers!—Dare say
You'd a pot in that pile. But the game's had its day.
My advent is fast getting known to the town;
Like the Coon to our Colonel—you’ll have to come down.'”
“Come down!” yelled the Butcher. “A jolly fine joke:
How charMiNg You Look

IN FANCY DRESS.
I HARDLY KNEW You !”
I'll come down on you hot, as you'll presently feel !"
And he went for that Bos with his knife and his steel;
But, hoist like a football-awoke,
And found he had º all his bills in his fright;–
An omen which spoiled his repose for the night.

ThE information imparted to Mr. Punch by his correspondent

the members of the Most Honourable and Loyal Society of Ancient
Britons, under the F. of the Right Hon. and Rev. LoRD

Willis's Rooms, and, as the Times reports, after playings, and

“The band struck up the March of the Men of Harlech, and boys and girls

RECONSTITUTION OF THE IRISH SOCIETY.
(By and for the Irish.)
HE following
scheme for a new
Organisation of
the Irish Societ
has been droppe
into Mr. Punch's
letter-box. There
was no clue to the
authorship, unless
such a clue maybe
afforded by a torn
card, containing
only the words,
“MAJOR O'G–,”
and a much soiled
paper, apparently
a portion of a pro-
vision merchant's
little account,
which seemed to
have found their
way by oversight
into the envelope.
The rules are
sº written . in º:
yery irregular
hands, with great
variety of ortho-
- - *º Some-
times the phonetic method, and sometimes the established rule
being followed. . We, have restored the conventional spelling
throughout, except in the case of a few Irishisms.
I. The Society, known as the Irish Society, elected out of the
London Livery Čompanies, shall and do from the date of these
presents renounce and surrender, freely, voluntarily, absolutely,
and of their own consent, or it will be worse for them, all their

their appurtenances, heretofore known as the estates of the
Irish Society in Derry, and Coleraine, or elsewhere, wheresoever
and whatsoever, as hereinafter provided.
II. All base, brutal, and Saxon use of the humiliating word
“livery,” in connection with the Trustees of the said Society, shall
cease henceforth and for ever, and any use of the word in connec-
tion with such Trustees, shall from the date of these presents
punishable as a felony by fine and imprisonment, without
benefit of clergy.
III. Three hundred and sixty-five Trustees of the said pro-
Fº and estates, whatsoever and whensoever, shall be elected,
y universal, suffrage, at a date to be fixed by the Act confirmin
ºnt Constitution, by the Irish people, from the people o
reland,
IV. For the purpose of such election, every voter entitled to vote
shall have one vote for himself and one or more for everybody else,
§ shall be at liberty to lump either vote upon both, or all on
eltner.
... W. The said three hundred and sixty-five Irishmen so elected,
irrespective of faith or faction, creed, couitry, or colour of their hair,
to be the sole Executive of the New Iriſh Šociety, and to enter on
the administration, thereof, for the benefit of the people of Ireland,
such benefit to be distributed, and apportioned in proportions to be
hereafter determined according to the creeds and populations of
counties. The farmers' clubs in the said several counties to fix the
saidſº ortions.
VI. Any dispute that may arise during the said elections, or in fixing
the said proportions, to be settled by arbitration with the ancient
ºl weapon of the Milesian people, the blackthorn, or shil-
elagºn.
#. All such weapons to be cut and trimmed to a scale and
weight, to be approved by the Irish Society, as hereby reconstituted,
and after a standard, to be kept in the archives of the Society,
under three locks, to be retained always by the Master of the Society
for the time being, and his predecessor and successor.
. VIII. Every Trustee of the Society to have been born and to live
in Ireland for the term of his natural life, and in the event of his
being.elected to serve in the Parliament of Great Britain, to bind
himself by oath to vote with the Irish Home Rule party for the time
being, as required by its recognised leader, and if there be two or
more such leaders, by the one he likes best.
IX. No Lord *. or Alderman of London to be eligible as
Trustee of the said Society, unless he is an Irishman by birth and
nationality, and if any such should be chosen, he shall abjure his
allegiance to the Municipality of London before entering on his duties
as a Trustee of the Society; - - -
X. No tenant of the said lands or estates to be liable to eviction
for any cause whatsoever, except in the event next hereinafter
provided. All such tenants to be treated aisy in regard to their rints,
and quarter-days to be shifted to suit their convenience. ..

fixed charge on the rental of the said lands and estates, and to
stand as in the present accounts of the said Society, at £4,500
per annum, with a margin for extras. The item “Management,”
to include among such extras_arms and ammunition required by
tenants and trustees of the said estates for attack and defence; and
the item “Refreshment,” to include among such extras doctors'

appliances of social enjoyment. -
XIII. All Trustees attending the meetings of the Society to be
required to leave their bits of twigs outside the door of the place
of meeting.
XIV. Three Trustees to be a quorum, unless more are present
within three hours of the time fixed for any meeting. -

of opinion, arbitration, or argument, or the consequences thereof,
within the next three years below a quorum, as hereinbefore con-
stituted, the management of the said land and estates to pass to a
Gentleman who has long been known as the truest Friend of Ireland,
not meaning MR. BUTT, Q.C., as to whom the present schame
desires to express no opinion, beyant remarking that it is a pity if
he's the best that can be got to spake up for ould Ireland. .
XVI. In the event of the said Friend of Ireland coming into the
management of the said lands and estates, he shall be required
to .# to his name the definite article of Milesian tribal chieftain-
ship, and the vowel of Milesian patronymic_significance, and be
known as The O'Punch, meaning thereby the Irish whiskey Punch,
and he will be further required to bind himself, before the Six
Masters in Chancery and Irish History, to drink nothing but that
same for the rest of his natural life. -

The two Water-Bailiffs, who were two brothers of the name of

JET SAM), produced a warrant and a pair of handcuffs.
“Never!” cried MARY, as, quitting her father, she threw her
arms about WILLIAM.

the Stevedore. “WILLIAM can either go to prison, or, take his

RIP WAN WINKLE ON HIS ROUNDS.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
IT is not often I venture out of my quiet nest in the country, where I
fell asleep many, many, years ago.
week in Town, and a round of the Theatres. Once I used to dread, while I
craved, the excitement of this sudden transition from long sleep into sudden
life. The rush of novelty was too much for me. But now how different my
experience! -
n nine out often of the Theatres, if the managers had planned their entertain-
ment to suit my nerves and consult my feelings, they would have put forth just
the bills I see. A hazy halo of antiquity hovers round these programmes, and
takes off all sharp shock of newness. The first theatre I visited after my last
waking was the Haymarket. I rather doubted the wisdom of beginning with
that dear little, ugly, inconvenient, old home of legitimate comedy. BUCKSTONE
used to be such a fellow for novelty in his pieces, if not his performers. He
never fell back on the stock old comedies, while there was a lively new one to
be tempted on to the boards “Here,” I thought to myself, “I shall be sure
to see a picture of life as it is, fresh, sparkling, and above all, English to the
backbone. But shali I ever be able to stanå the shoºk?” judge of my
amazement to find as the pièce de résistance of the evening's entertainment a
classical comedy in blank verse, which I remember to have seen produced many
years ago. As it was very fairly acted by some of the men—not all, though, by
any means—and admirably by two of the ladies, in particular, the actress who
played Pygmalion's jealous wife, and the charming ingénue who gave a new Ch
grace to the heroine—the freshest thing by far I have seen in my rounds—I was
not disappointed with my evening, and, on the whole, felt thankful for the
interposition of an old play between my slumberous country existence and the
new histrionic experiences, which must, I felt, be awaiting me in my future
adventures... But lo! the further I fared, the staler grew the pieces. , Original
or adapted, it was all the same. If the English dress was new, the French original
was safe to be old; while, if the English was original, it was of an antiquity
more or less venerable.
Thus, at the Prince of Wales's, that delightful drawing-room house, which
I have always associated with drawing-room plays of home growth, instead
of a charming comedy, of RoBERTson's, I found myself assisting at the
performance—an admirable one, I am bound to say—of an adaptation from
But when I do wake up it is usually for alP
SARDou's comedy of Les Intimes, an old acquaintance
in its original garb, and adapted more than once already;
in which the French figure showed through the English
dress like a Mossoo masquerading as a Milord.
At the Court, the Strand, and the Folly, Ifound myself
º safe from the shock of novelty. Here the staple
of the entertainment was furnished by old friends, two
Haymarket, comedies, and, one Olympic comedietta,
which I had first enjoyed—I won’t say how many years
ago—long before I sank into my country slumber.
True, if good acting can freshen old parts, there was a
great deal of it employed in New Men and Old Acres:
while MR. CLARKE's breadth of grotesqueness in Beetle,
MIss LYDIA THoMPson's grace in Mrs. Smylie, and
MR. LIon EL. Brough's unexaggerated truth in the north
country manufacturer, Ironstone, gave much effect to
the characters. But they couldn't make old plays new.
At the Adelphi and the Princesses, still in my fearful
search for novelty, I had to face nothing newer than
two venerable melodramas, which have survived the
shocks of repeated revivals.
Hurrying thence to the Vaudeville, where some years
ago I had seen a most amusing comedy of MR. ByRoN's
most excellently acted, you may guess my relief to find
the very amusing .# still in the bills, and to learn
that no change in the programme was expected for many
years to come.
At the Globe I was let down as easily by an old bur-
lesque of º evergreen friend PLANCHE.'s, which I
remember to have laughed at when I was a little boy.
At the Saint James's I was treated to a very well
acted version of a French piece, which had had the
gloss of novelty well taken off here and in Paris, by
long runs in both capitals in its original French.
Even at the Olympic, where the piece was new, it
was the dramatised version of a novel that certainly was
not.
My last venture was at the Gaiety, and here, strange
to say, I did find novelty, though in the experienced
hands of an old, old, friend—the Toole that never
seems to lose point or edge, for all its hard work, in the
long intervals between my naps, but looks always, each
time I come upon it at work, as bright and sharp as ever.
Here I saw, in Artful Cards, an English piece, built
up out of an idea suggested by a French one, but Eng-
lish in the cast of its fun, its jokes, dialogue, and treat-
ment of incident; English, above all, in its avoidance of
impurity and impropriety. The shock to my nerves was
sharp, but not insalubrious. I laughed till I cried at
Artful Cards, and since then my sleep has been haunted
by visions of ToolE, struggling with a Trombone.
ere, too, I saw a BIshop on the stage, who really did
almost as much credit to the Bench, by his excellent
erformance on the Boards, as my liberal and large-
minded friend, DR. FRAzer, of Manchester, by his
appearance at the leading Manchester theatres the other
day. This was the only performance that put my nerves
to a severe trial, and showed me there was still some-
§ { new to be seen in a London Theatre, a fact which,
but for this, I might have doubted, and gone back to my
repose in the comfortable conviction that on the boards
at least all was as I left it when I fell asleep, I won't
say how many years ago.
Yours sincerely, RIP REDIVIVUs.
Worse and Worse!
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
KNowINg your wise horror of Ritualism, I beg
to direct your attention to a startling novelty in vest-
ments at St. James's, Hatcham, which I cull from this
day's Standard. After the usual freefight, the offertory
alms, says the reporter, “were collected by six of the
oirmen'in red bags” . Such is the growth of the seed
§§ MR. Tooth ! No wonder the congregation, like
the bulls in Spain, get excited, when they see the Choir-
men walking about in red bags / I certainly think the
Bishop should write to MR. DALE. Surely he can be no
party to such proceedings?

I think, though it may be a true #. enough, was scarce a seemly saying for a Judge on the Bench, that should know nothing of law
for rich or law for poor, but should look only to the law that he is set there to administer, and the breaking of it that he is bound to punish.
Still, when one thinks of all the crimes that do come of poaching nowadays, one can understand that the Judge who has to punish

crime may well feel sore at the thought that an amusement of rich
men—which certainly fowling be—should cause the poor so much
temptation. . And, indeed, for all the cost of raising and keeping of
game, there is, and ever will be, a difference in men's minds between
killing wild things and stealing tame; and I do myself feel it, in
spite of law, and, some do say, logic. Yet methinks the logic can
scarce be all against them that think so. Still, I would not have
a Judge own to this. So I was sorry my LoRD justice conting:
gave back flout for flout, and wrote a high, huffing letter, denying
the right of the House to call him to account. For I do sº the
House hath, or do claim, the right to call all to account, and will
not that its right should be questioned.
MR. GRANT DUFF, the sharp-faced, red-haired, thin man, that did
mind me of a weasel the first time I saw and heard him, mighty
keen to know who called back CAPTAIN BURNABY, of the Queen's
Brigade of Guards, that had ridden to Khiva, and was using his eyes
when there, as his legs to #. there, and did ask whether if the
recall came from our §. Office, it came not from Russia, and thence
round by the Foreign Office, which MR. HARDY would not answer,
and methinks the question a little troubled him. And I do hear
that the more it is asked the less it is like to be answered. But I do
not think that in the old Protector's time we would have bid back
a Captain at the Muscovite's bidding, or any other foreign Prince's.
Then MB. SECRETARY HARDY to moving of his War Estimates.
But, lord! to think how little in these days a Minister doth make to
ask for nigh º fifteen millions for one Office, which is three times
as much as all the Offices together did costin my time. Lord grant the
money be but well spent. And he mighty pleased that all doth go
so well with his Office, and recruits coming in merrily—if somewhat
small in stature and young in years, and doth hope promotion and
retirement will soon go on as briskly as recruiting, which I wish may
be so, but do find many doubting, especially officers that do wait a
promotion or wish for good terms of retirement. They that had
abused the War-Office schemes mighty ready and large inº ;
above all one MURE, a Colonel, did, as it were, put his head under
MR. SECRETARY HARDy's foot, and ask to be danced on—which,
methought, was scarce seemly, though I am glad Mr. Secretary hath
good ground to be so cheery: and, lord! to think how different it
was in my time, and how now your great heads of Offices, must
come cap in hand to the House of Commons, and how rejoiced º
are when they have a good account to render of their Offices; an
how in my time we thought little of the Parliament, and much of
the Offices, and I, for #. would have taken it mighty illif any
under a Lord had meddled with the accounts or business of Our
Office. And now all changed. And I do hope it is all for the better
—and do indeed think so, not being myself now in Office.
Tuesday.-In my Lords' House my LoRD MIDDLETON was to have
put a question touching my LoRD CHIEF JUSTICE Col.FRIDGE's sh
saying of the law against poaching; but as the same question h
been put in the Commons the night before, my Lord did not put it.
But methinks I may well be content that I hold my place no longer
in Our Office, after I did hear MR. WARD HUNT, that is now First
Lord Commissioner therein, so scurvily handled to-nightby allmanner
of Members, great and small, for miscarriages aboard the Queen's
ships, whereof all, big or little, at sea orin harbour, be now laid at the
door of the Office, or on the back of the First Lord, so that he do
seem to stand up in the House, as it were a popinjay for all to
shoot at. Yet, indeed, he do bear him bravely enough, and some-
times shot back stoutly. Though methinks there be much nowa-
days in the ordering of our Fleet that were well otherwise, whereof
as the old saw hath it, “least said soonest mended.” But, ioral
when I think of Our Office in my time, how we had much ado to la
hold of four or five hundred thousand pound by the year, an
these in odd moneys scrabbled up anyhow, and for months together
neither cash, nor stores, nor credit, save as we might pledge our
own, and all cheating the King * could, and * T, º:
seamen coming crying to us for their money, and lying dyin
nastily of their wounds and scurvy sores under the Office *ś
And now the,0ffice may spend nigh on eleven millions by the year,
and have it too, which is more, as they need, and never a day in
arrear; and all handsome and the best that money can buy both aboard
the ships and in the Yards and the Qffice, and the Queen's credit as
; as the biggest merchant's or goldsmith's in the City, or, indeed,
etter. And yet for all this I do think Our Office be more girded at,

and cried out upon now-a-days than it used to be in my time, save
only on the head of money, for now all may have their dues, to the
day, from the First Lord down, which is brave, and, as it seems to
me, strange; only no gifts that I can hear of, and no commissions,
at least none openly allowed of; which is worse for them in the
Office; so, methinks, with money, or without, it do come to much
the same upshot.
But 'tis plain to see that things be not more changed in the matter
of money than in all besides about the ordering of the Fleet. For our
ships be now more like busy laboratories of curious j.
than plain pitched oaken hulls worked by honest hempen sai and
tarred ropes, like those CoMMISSIONER PETT used to build in the Yard
at Deptford. And, methinks, for Captains, our ships now-a-days
with their steam as they call it, and their nice engine work, shoul
need rather such virtuosos as used to meet at Gresham House, like
SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN and SIR WILLIAMPETTY and other rare
mechanique heads of that kidney, than your common -breeched
salt-water Captains like LAwson and SPRAGGE, and the rest
that did so maul the Dutch in # time, who, indeed knew but what
belonged to º fighting their ships, and there an end. Yet I
could not learn that the Office had * clapped hands on such a
virtuoso kind of Captains, but are still fain to be content with the
old #. and sailing sort, which amazes me, and I marvel how
they have so changed all else aboard our ships, but yet the officers so
little, and the Office not much, save, as I do rejoice to see, in the
matter of money, that is now to be had for the asking.
And, perhaps, when the Office do come by officers of the right
virtuoso fashion, there will be fewer miscarriages aboard our ships-
that be now, methinks, like horses too strong and skittish for their
riders. So there may come to be less crying out upon the Office and less
shooting at my Lords, and not so much matter for hot talk, such
as I heard to-night from Members. And I pray it may soon be S0,
for of all this fault-finding I do see but little profit to the QUEEN,
or the State, or the Ships, or the Office.
Much merriment to-night by reason of MR. SolICITOR-GENERAL,
that hath gone up and down seeking for a seat this longtime past,
and hath now found one, whereof I am glad, as methinks he should
| be. And he coming to the table to be sworn before the SPEAKER as
is wont, could not find the warrant of his return; and after much
rummaging in all his pockets, whereof I think never man had more
or fuller, was sore gravelled, till SIR WILLIAM HART DYKE was fain
to go back to the new Members' place under the Gallery, where washis
hat, and did straight find the return therein, and so MR. SolICIToR-
GENERAL did get to take the oaths at last. But, lord! to see how the
House did laugh! Though, indeed, a little thing do divert them;.
.#. JoHNLUBBoCK, a great virtuoso and rich, did
move his Bill for the .."; of Ancient Monuments, such as
British stones, and mounds, and dykes, that have no beauty to com-
mend them, only curious for antiquity, and now grievously made
away with, as indeed I remember many in my time that are now
long since carted off, or ploughed up, or broken for roads, or built
into walls, or other uses. But, lord! to see how sharp some Šid speak
against the Bill, that it should strike at º ; and how my Lord
FRANCIS HERVEY, that, methought, should have been wiser, did
abuse the ancient Britons, that it amazed me to find such heat on
such a matter, only I see your landlords do not like any meddling
with the land for never no monuments, yet the Bill passed by 211 to
163, and referred to a Select Committee, which methinks was
reasonable. And, indeed, I do in most matters see much reason
in the Members of the #ouse, for all their heats and over-much
talking; which pleases me, now that wellnigh everything is laid on
their hands.

Asia to. †". the Muscovites; but the Secretary for War, as
before, did refuse to say wherefore. And methinks this a matter
the Office would not have inquired into. So I am sorry they should
be vexed with all this questioning of it.
Much talk over a Vaſuation Bill that I could not understand, nor
the House either, methought, save some City and Country Gentle-
men, that did talk mighty ; and dull, till the Bill was read a

joining of some of their own with most of the other side, was fain to

MASKELYNE AND FEMININE.
-- N moving, on the second read-
SN- ing of the Billforthe Removal-
N of the Electoral Disabilities of
- Women, that it be read this day
six months, MR, HAN-
BURY may avail him-
self of an addition to
the stock arguments
based on women's
natural disabilities.
It has already been
urged by the oppo-
ments of feminine
emancipation that
women are unfit to
vote for Members of
Parliament, because,
although iadies are
generally taught
music, there has never
yet arisen a first-rate
female Composer. The
same proof that
Woman is inferior to
Man might be drawn
from the fact, that the
world has not yet seen
a woman of any note
to speakof as a female
conjuror. There never arose amongst womankind a match for Robert
HounſN, nor any Witch to mate the Wizard of the North... Yet every-
body knows how girls are trained up to practise witchery in their own
way... Time was, too, when witches were believed, not only by dolts
but divines of the period, to ride on broomsticks; and not long ago
a “medium” suitable to a side-saddle was declared by Spiritualists
to have been transported three miles, and in through closed doors, or
walls, or down a chimney, on to a table. But no such performance
of witchcraft was ever publicly exhibited. At MASKELYNE AND
Cooke's séances MR. CookE “floats in the room, taking with him the
cabinet in which he is secured.”. Whatever may have happened in
days of old, or may now happen in private circles, on the open plat-
form CookE stands unrivalled, and MASKELYNE has no competitor of
his own gender, still less of the feminine. In public conjuring even
male “mediums” never rise to mediocrity, and those of the other
sex can hardly conjure at all. So the Hon; Member for Tamworth will
be able, if ungallant enough, unanswerably to contend that Women
are unfit to exercise the elective franchise because they are no
conjurors.
NEWER THAN NEW.
As the Public, in its thirst for information, is being supplied with
the topics of to-morrow and a digest of the day after, there is no
saying where the journalist will stop in his desire to assuage the
craving of the literary customer, who wants to know what is going
to happen. Mr. Punch proposes therefore the issue of a publica-
tion, to be called -
“THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.” (Price 6d.)
The first Number (to be issued as soon as the enormous steam-
presses required for the colossal circulation in prospect have been
erected) will contain leaders on the great anti-IGNATIEFF speech
that LoRD BEAgoNSFIELD is preparing in the House of Lords; on
Political and Military Reforms in Turkey; and on MR. CHAPLIN's
heavy counter, when he gets a chance of giving it to MR.GLAnstone
in the House of Čommon. These will be fºllowed by a sporting leader
on the merits of the winning boatin the Oxford and Cambridge Race,
with details of the race, and account of the accident that is sure to come
to MR. SMASHAway's steam-launch, and the block thus occasioned on
the river opposite the Limes at Mortlake. Several pages, under the
heading “On Dira,” will contain satirical repartees in contempla:
tion by political Leaders, and witticisms about to be perpetrated
by diners-out, burlesque writers, and popular journalists. - - -
In fact that most attractive of all virtues in literary or artistic
work, the imprévu, will season everything, and secure, it is con-
fidently anticipated, for the new publication a circulation larger
than the largest circulation in the world, so extensively proclaimed
on the hoardings. - -

PUNCH IN THE POLAR REGIONS.
To an epitome of the preliminary report of the Arctic Committee,
lately transmitted to the First Lord of the Admiralty, the Sanitary
Record appends the observation that—
“It will be seen that the whole result of the inquiry may be summed up
tersely in the words of SURGEoN Colan, that in any future sledge expedi-
tions if anything has to be left behind, it should be the rum and not the lime-
juice. It was this conviction which led us in the first instance to challenge
the course pursued by CAPTAIN NAREs in sending the rum and leaving out
the lime-juice, and we can but rejoice, in the interests of the Service, that
this inquiry has resulted in so unanimous and so complete a confirmation of
that view.”
It may be said that lime-juice is no more a preventive of scurvy
than vaccination of smallpox; and some may say this, not believing
that smallpox is preventible by vaccination. CAPTAIN NAREs, how-
ever, is not one of these fools. He “decided not to send lime-juice
on the sledging parties on account of the difficulty of carrying and
melting it,” and would on any future sledge expedition “certainly
so modify the arrangements as to admit of sending lime-juice.” To
be sure, and one obvious way of modifying the arrangements for
that purpose would be to send the lime-juice in combination with
the rum. Add a due, portion of sugar. Everybody knows how to
name the liquid which those ingredients would form, and were it to
congeal, what would it then be but iced punchº A Qompound
universally celebrated as a remedy for “the gout, the colic and the
hthisic” would doubtless be found most effectually antiscorbutic.
R. Col.AN may be quite . in saying that, if anything has to be
left behind by Arctic explorers, it should be the rum and not the
lime-juice; but by far the preferable plan would surely be to leave
neither behind, but to take both, by the simple expedient of mixing
them together. This would have the further advantage of ensuring
the sure and ready swallowing of the specific for scurvy. Sailors
are prone to shirk lime-juice pure and simple, but there is little
fear that JACK would ever decline the acid in union with the other
elements of the abovenamed mixture.
HUNT ON HOLES.
IF the First Lord of the Admiralty knew or minded his SHAR-
SPEARE as he ought, he would not perhaps have answered the
allegation that the Vanguard sank because there were holes in her
bulkhead, by the excuse that “they were very small holes.” Had
he read, marked, learned, and inwardly digested the divine WIL-
LIAMS, he might have learned that as .# hole will as effectually
do for a man as a great hole, if only the little one is sufficiently
large, so will it serve as effectually to sink a man-of-war. A rapier
thrust had made a little hole in the chest of Mercutio, Let MR.
WARD. HUNT perpend Mercutio’s answer to his friend Romeo's
suggestion that “the hurt cannot be much":—
“Mercutio. No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church-door,
but 'tis enough—"twill serve; ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find me a
grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world."
Qur Minister seems to have needed to be taught that the little
hole in a man's side that will let out the life has its counterpart in
the little hole in the side of an ironclad which is big enough to let
in the water, albeit “ only a little one.” But, perhaps he will ever-
more bear this point in mind hereafter in dealing with the appoint-
ment of Officers such as those by whose *; although
they may have been “not absolute idiots,” the Vanguard, in
consequence of some of those little holes being left open in her
bulkhead, went to the bottom.

“We understand one

Stevedore of his com-

“Ay, ay replie
the other, in the same

“Who are onboard?”
“The Skipper, the

coals), and the third Mate with five hands.”
“A useful person this last.”
“Yery handy. But we have been one too many for him.”
: Is the fate of the ship assured?” -
“Yes, assured as you know–insured. The ship is overloaded.
Its load-line is painted high up over a false level.”
: Who did that?” asked the Stevedore, anxiously.
“The § of course.”
: But he will split,” returned the Stevedore.
“The Ship's. Painter split!” replied, the other, disdainfully,

This parchment, with
its s and Govern-

a “Bottomry Bond.”
The drawer of such a

FROM ONE POINT OF VIEW.
SCENE–British Jury Room. * All agreed on their Verdict except—
Irish Juryman (who holds out). “AH, THIN, ILIv'N MoRE obstiNIT MEN INIv1B MET IN ALL ME Loire | | "
So the bad ship Albert Ross left her moorings, and slowly sailed
out of the Harbour.
A boy said to another boy, as she passed along, “My eye!”
A policeman observed to another policeman, “By Jingo!”
The harbour-master sighed heavily, and went in to supper.
A mild, near-sighted gentleman exclaimed, “Dear me!”
Two workmen observed to one another, “Darned if they wouldn't
rather do nothing for forty shillings a week on shore than work
without wages on board that there ship for a month.”
Amid such Cassandra-like predictions of woe, the Albert Ross was
steaming out of Newport-Pagnell, with WILLIAM TAILLEUR aboard,
when a lithesome figure, in the costume of a Middy, sprang from the
pier-head and alighted safely on the vessel. . . .
The Stevedore on shore, with a glass in his wicked eye, alone
recognised the person. -
“Per jingösſ” exclaimed the Spaniard. “It is MARY MAYBUD!”
It was she indeed—in disguise.
And it was too late to stop the bad coffin-ship Albert Ross, with
its deadly shrouds and false load-line, on its outward-bound course
to the Bottom of the Deep, Dead Sea.
(To be continued.)
“Keeping Watch o'er the Life of Poor Jack.”
THE brig No Name, from Liverpool, to Africa, “laden' with
coals, gunpowder (very badly stowed), and paraffin oil, made a good
deal of water,”—clearly the wisest course under the circumstances,<-
and her crew refused to proceed—also wisely.
A member of the Government, in an after-dinner speech,"said
that “no idea was likely to enter the head of any responsible
adviser of HER MAJESTY whereby a single button of our sailors'
jackets would be placed in jeopar #: any matters arising out of
the internal administration of the Turkish Empire.”
Comparing these two announcements, JACK will be likely to
exclaim, “Dash my buttons—but don’t blow me up.”
OUT OF REASON INTO RHYME.
(A. Hatcham Bull.)
DEAR CRooM and dear PIIMPTON, all thanks for your letter.
Go on as you're doing; you couldn't do better.
Just put that schismatical assin a fix . -
Who wants to score honours by trumping our tricks.
The half-hearted scoundrel, the mealy-mouthed dog!!
Give me a down-righter who goes the whole hog :
I must own some respect for a knock-me-downranter;
Trot and gallop I like, but I can't stand a canterl
The notion of standing, while all the rest sit.
Was sº delicious: 'I º I should split,
When I heard how you balked him, and bothered, and worried;
No wonder, I’m sure, the poor creature was flurried.
But the row tºother day went a leetle too far; :
If you try roles de fait there's a danger you'll mar'
A sweet little plan—which were nipped in the bud
If you gave the foe notice, or stirred up my Lud.
At present, you see, I am forced to be dumb:
The Doctors forbid all excitement—so mum!
But bide we our time, and some sunshiny morning,
Without giving DALE and his myrmidons warning
We'll break in, as they broke—fair reprisals, you know-
If they use the jemmy, why not we the grow?
Once in, we’re the masters; we’ll lead 'em a dance,
Make each hair stand on end in the wig of PENZANCE."
Good-bye, dear Churchwardens; we fight for the truth.
Get the fallals in order. Yours ever, A. Tooth.

of Women.” Punch offers the Author the following “casus omissiº
of this influence:—
MR. HAUGHTY HENPECK was heard to tell his friend FITZ-GEORGE
that the O'MILLIONs were “snobs,” and that he would not set foot
in their house again. MR. HENPEgK subsequently had an interview
with his wife, when they accepted an invitation to dine with the
O'MILLIONs on the following Thursday,
MR, JACK GoLIGHTLY was lamenting, the folly of those of his
friends who, after .* gave up their Club and even their
smoke, since jºck married Miss Tºe Tygen he has neither been
seen in his Club nor with a cigar in his mouth.
MR. WILBERFoRCE FUNKIT said his mother-in-law should never
set foot in the house again. Two days after, his wife's mother
arrived, tied a white #. on the knocker, aná put WILBERFoRCE
to sleep in a closet under the stairs.
MR. PATERNOSTER Row said he would publish no more rubbish
written by women. A new three-volume novel by his wife is, how-
ever, on his list of forthcoming works.
MR. CHARLIE HAWKER asserted that the Boat Race was allrot, and
that he would go to it no more. After calling on Miss FLORRY
#ºn he was heard to order a barouche for the morning of the
24th inst,
MR. GRINDER GRUMPY, after stating that his wife should
spend_no more in frippery this month, inadyertently took a walk
with MRs. G.G. down Regent Street. In half an hour he had
spent thirty shillings on a bonnet, and thirty guineas on a fur cloak.
Mr. Punch, who had been reading various new periodicals, was
heard to say that he didn’t know what women were coming to in
these days; but, coming home from an evening party, he went to
d with visions of many fair forms, and was heard to mutter in his

(NDAY, March 12.-My LoRD CHANGELLOR (reports the pertinacious Ghost of PEPys),
mighty busy with my Lords mending two holes in the Law relating to Land, which it
do amazeme should have been left unmended so long. One, that if I die and leave
my land to one son, and my money to another, and the land be under mortgage, he
that hath the land may take his brother's money to pay off his mortgage, which
law one may clearly see to have been made by those that had the land; and the
other, that if one leave me an estate for life &#. I would any had done, but
none ever did, only handsome gifts, thank Heaven, in money, and Fº and
jewels) with remainder to him of my cousin Roger's sons who should first reach
twenty-one, and I, had died before any of Roger's sons came to that, age-as
indeed none ever did live to manhood—then the remainder, as the lawyers do callit
would be void, and the land go to the heir-at-law, against the intent and wish alike o
the testator, and me, and Roger, that had all meant to keep the land in one line;
which now is to be changed, and methinks should be. -
My LoRD DoRCHESTER did very briskly question my LoRD DERby again to-night of that travelling Captain that the Foreign Office
and the War Office between them had back with a cesserara from Khiva the other day, to please the Muscovite as all do say and t
though my LoRD DERBY will not have it so, but do now talk grave of the dangers to the Captain from the Tartars, and how he should
perchance be taken for an agent of our Government. But methinks it had been sufficient for our Government to deny this, without
calling this stout. Captain home, that had gone so far and at such cost of money and sore bones. And now I do hear that the same
Qaptain hath ridden, through Asia Minor, as far as the city of Erzeroum, where the Muscovite do border on the Turk. And I do wonder
if the Turk also will have him back thence; and if our Offices will bid him home, to please the Turk, as they did to please the Muscovite.
But I hope not; for methinks an English Captain should be at no prince's bidding but his own, and would not have been in OLIVER's
time. But I fear English stomachs are not so high now as then, which vexes me.
In the Commons, before the First Lord Commissioner was let to move his Estimates, was much scrambling talk of naval businesses-
how my Lords had not gone wisely to work for the raising of the Vanguard, though, indeed, I doubt if there were any wisdom better than
leaving her where she lies; and one PETERTAYLOR, a man of mighty soft heart and as many do say soft head (as, indeed, your Englishman
18 º to confound soft heart with soft, head), did complain that the punishments aboard each ship of our Navy be no longer set out
as fully as they were wont to be; and grumblings touching the Pay and Pensions of Warrant Officers, and the weak boilers, put
aboard ship (but, lord! to think that ships have come, to need boilers other than those used for cooking of the men's beef!) and the
Anchors and. Cables that be used in the Navy, how these are the worst instead of the best, and I know not what matters besides, till
I at length did think myself back in Our Office in Seething Lane, with MR. Coyº NTRY and the two SIR WILLIAMs wrangling over our

Afterwards my LoRD DUKE, OF RICHMOND did bring in a Bill
for amending of the Law touching Burials; wherein the Puritans,
that be as stiff-necked, now as they were in my time, do complain
sore that they may not be buried in the parish ground with services
of their own, but must have the Parson read that of the Church of
England over their Yes; willy-nilly, which vexes the living, if not
the dead. But methinks 'tis strange your Churchman and Puritan
should be so by the ears about the manner of putting away their
poor quiet dead bodies, that methinks have most of them had more
than enough of clapper-clawing in their lifetimes; but so it is, and
now the Duke's Bill, I do fear, will do little to help matters to a
settlement of this foolish quarrel. Qnly it do empower parishes
to make new grounds, wherein bodies may be buried, with such
orderly services as to their friends may seem fit; but yet in parish
§. s there may be no burying but either with the service of the
hurch of England or no service at all: which methinks will never

said, and bring figures to show that the potting in Gottenburg was
worse than ever since this plan was tried, and how º: be
surely putting a great and evil power in the hands of Corporations,
and how the more folk drank it would needs be the better for them
in their new business of sellers of drink. And indeed methinks
it needs must be so, so that I wondered, how SIR WILFRIn Lawson,
that would have two-thirds of them that pay rates empowered to
shut public-houses, should vote for this Bill, that would enable a
bare majority of them that make rates to open them. But indeed
SIR WILFRID is more witty than wise; and so the House did seem
to think, and did throw out the Bill by 103 to 51.
Then one BIGGAR, an Irishman, that spoke with a harsh voice and
a great brogue, º: up; all the House did waii. out; and
so all at an end by nine o'clock, and I glad to get away, and
the House methinks, And I do see now the use of such Members
as this BIGGAR, that when they rise to speak, the House .
straight rise to go, and with good cause. And, above all, I am gla
for MR. SPEAKER, that must needs listen to so much idle talking,
and may not go till the House rises; and I admire how patiently
he do bear it, and keep a brave countenance.
Wednesday.-A Bill by one SIR. RobºBT ANSTRUTHER, for ham-
pering, if it may be, the sale of Intoxicating Drinks in Scotland; but
methinks.the Scotch do hold too much to their “usquebagh,” as
they call it, to be keen for any º: of the traffic therein. And
indeed it is a mighty comfortable liquor, above all when drunk hot
with sugar, as I have drunk it aboard one of our men-of-war, the
Lion, that I was aboard of off the Brill when we brought the King
over, which had a Scotch Captain that loved it, and would have me
pledge him in a brimming bowlofusquebagh punch, which he called
toddy, with right Jamaica limes. So I do not marvel that SIR
RoBERT, had but poor help to-night to the hindering of the sale of
strong drinks in Scotland, but did lose his Bill by 253 to 90.
Thursday-Nothing to note of my Lords.
In the Commons was another night of asking for money—Supply, as
they do still call it, and so they used in our time, only now the House
do tº all it is asked for, and then it did not, but both the King
and the Officers had to catch at the coin as they could, one against
the other, and oft neither could catch any. Only now, though the
House do give all that is asked for, Members must needs first,
and so they have what they call their “grievances” for pegs to hang
their talk on ; but, lordſ, when I do think of my time, and the
jº. that were indeed grievances then, and not a word
reathed of them in or out of the House, it do seem strange to me.
So to-night they did talk, ever so long of, marvellous pitiful
matters, as the slitting of a widow woman's dog's throat by an Irish
*ś and the widening of a road, and the employing of six
soldiers last year to gut a º: of standing corn, and the pranks of
the schoolboys .# or the lº aboard the Britannia, and i
know not what other silly stuff, that I wondered at it. And when
it came to voting of the money I did again wonder at some that
methought should have known better, that were for cutting down
the wages of them that do serve the State in our black settlements
on the Guinea shore, where white men do indeed live so miser-
ably that methinks they need, scarce grieve to die quickly, yet
must needs make provision for them they leave behind them. And
I wonder how MR. GEORGE TREVELYAN and SIR CHARLEs DILKE, and
the rest of the lusty young fellows that were so brisk for cutting
down, such salaries to-night, would like the same lopping and top-
ping i. it had been their part to receive the wages ins of award-
ing them.
i did marvel too at the grumbling about the choice of young
fellows from the Foreign Office to go with my Lord MARQUIs of
SALISBURY to Turkey, that they should be those that knew least of
the Turk and his matters. As if great Lords that go on missions of
State, or they that have the naming of the young gallants to go
with them, are used to choose according to men's knowledge of the
matters to be taken in hand! And indeed it do vex me to hear such
simple talk, and from some that should be wiser.
Friday (Lords).-My Load CHANCELLQR hath a Bill for a man to
make himself bankrupt, if need be, and so to have his substance
fairly carved among his creditors, which methinks is but reason;
but my LoRD HATHERLEY likes it not, as thinking that the Lawyers
should have the first F. in such cases, as the Doctors do not
love that a man should go out of the world without them.
(Commons.)—The CHANCELLOR of THE EXCHEQUER do assure my
LoRD HARTINGTON that the Government do indeed hope they are in
a way to clap up a paper bridge for the Muscovite to go back over,
But I admire that a few words cunningly drawn into a protocol
should save us from what all did fear would be the º: and
bloodiest war of this time. And so I find do, most ; only for the
moment such a protocol'tis thought may serve the turn. And so all
glad of it, but most, the most shallow-witted.
Then much talk of the Irish school children, how they may not
be driven to school, yet will go of themselves three days out of five,
and will learn more in that time than your duller English children
in two days out of three.
Much debate but to little end of what should be done when Slaves
do seek shelter aboard our Ships in Eastern waters. But I do;
plainly see that SIR. GeoRGE CAMPBELL, that did raise the matter, do?
weary the House with too much and too often talking; Yet as he
is a man that hath had weighty charge in India, so I doubt not
he do look on talk º the business to be done in this House. As,
indeed I find many do.
One WHALLEY, %. same that is wont to fall foul of the Pope on
alloccasions—perhaps, as being sent to the House from Peterbºrough,
for which borough of Peter, indeed, the Pope do claim to be sole
Member–did talk to-night of the other matter that do set his wits
wool-gathering, which is ARTHUR QRTON, a fat knave now...in
prison, that did take the name of SIR Roger, TICHBORNE, and, after
8. º tedious trial, was º in gaol for it, where he still
lies; and now this WHALLEY will still have him to be TICHBoRNE,
but can bring none in the House to the same mind, save one
Osborne a lack-brain like himself, and doth ; the matter in by
head and ears whenever he can, and did to-night, to the wearying
of the House, and MR. SecBETARY CRoss, that did very hardly make
shift to answer this WHALLEY civilly; and I do see, Peterborºugh
is more proud to have a Member with a mind of his own, than.
careful what fashion of mind it be.
our ESTABLISHED DISSENTERS.
T is said that some of the Noncon;
formists, within the Established
Church have at last determined
to do the right thing—secede, and
form a dissenting sect, entitled to do
as they please in their own conventi-
cles. The Whitehall Review
announces that a section of
High Church and Ritualist
members of the Church of
England contemplate the
foundation of “a new An-
lican Communion.”. They
ave resolved upon this step
“in consequence of the ac-
tion taken by . Anglican
relates under the Publiq
W. Regulation Act.”
Accordingly, they intend #
have an episcopate of the
own. “In the first place a
brand-new Archbishop, with
a very ancient title, is to be
consecrated by one or moré
; prelates.” The re-
mainder of the Bench is tº
consist of “two Suffragans, each with titles from old English sees; ”
and the new Anglican Communion to be started next July. In the
meanwhile :-
“The difficulty attendant on the consecration of the Archbishop and his
Suffragans (as far as regards any interference with existing jurisdictions;
whether Popish or others) will be surmounted by the ingenious plan of con-
secrating them upon the high seas.” -
The last statement suggests a suspicion that the preceding news is
too gºod to be true..., How can interference with existing episcopal
jurisdictions be avoided by the consecration of Bishops on the high
seas, if the Bishops are so consecrated for the purpose, nevertheless
of wielding opposition grosiers in the sees ashore? The occupants o
those land sees would account the maritime intruders no pre-
lates, but mere poachers on their manors. Obviously, a consecra-
tion, performed, for an evasive purpose, although on board ship,
would be anything but an above-board .. It would be
out of place and unsuitable even as a qualifieation for Fº to
the fishes, which could be, done as well without as with it by any-
body, lay or cleric, , And then the flat-fish would hardly come up to
hear a preacher of Ritualism, and the ocean does not contain
gudgeons. Altogether this idea of consecrating High Bishops 9
the high seas appears to be a far-fetched derivation from the maxim
that he “who drives fat oxen should himself be fat.” It is not
thing to be spoken of to the sailors, but awakes the suspicion tha
the whole statement in connection with it is no better than a st
fit only to be related to the other arm of Her Majesty's Sea Service
.# it, nevertheless, turn out to be authentic; for, if the Ritu
will only retire to their own. Ebenezers, the National Gh
will y agree to differ with them as their Dissenting Brethren.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
THE UNIVERSITY BOAT RACE, 1877.
HERE is no greater proof, of suc-
cess than the envy created in the
bosom of rivals. Punch has been
accused of being behind the age; so
he is, in the same sense that he is be-
hind the scenes. He knows
the effects in preparation,
and the actors about to
come on, before the spec-
it. i stalls or boxes,
plt or gallery.
E.g.—Mr. Punch, sent
his reporter overnight to
Putney on Friday next
(the Eve of St. Clasper),
with full powers to report
the coming race, and a
blank cheque to pay his
expenses at the Star and
Garter.
Mr. Punch, ever mind-
- ful of his young friends
the members of the rival Universities, forwarded for their ac-
ceptance, with his compliments, several feathers, both high and
low, for Cambridge, and some india-rubber tubs for Oxford; all of
which were received with cheers on the arrival of the reporter, who
lost no time in dipping his beak into the flowing cups in which the
rival Crews were drinking each other's healths, in the vain
attempt of each, to gruel the other before the race. The report
of the Saturday's race reached the Punch Qffice early on the
present Wednesday, thus proving satisfactorily to all interested
that Punch is rather befºre than behind the times, as certain
ribalds do vainly assert.
Saturday, March 24–The University Boat-Race was rowed this
morning “on the slack” (whatever that may be—it may be wire, it
may be rope, for all I know), at five A.M., before a º: of
spectators who could see nothing, owing to the fact that the sun had
not risen, and under a sprinkling of spring rain that kept coming down
at thirty-six to the minute. The water was very “poor,” we were
told, though #; by its thick and seemingly pea-soupy consist-
ence, we should have imagined it rather the reverse.
. As the Limes light was turned on, both Crews lit up the cheerful
cigarette, which, once kindled, was to light the way of the gallant
coxswains to the winning-post. Gradually the boats were launched,
and both paddled gently to their º: far out into the night, or
rather early morning. Nothing was au ible but the regular plash
of the paddles and the half-suppressed objurgations of strokes and
coxswains. The Umpire's boat not having arrived, your Reporter
and Artist were ai. upon to man the only wherry on the loose.
As the painter was cast overboard by some of the bystanders, I
had to trim the boat by myself as well as I could, § slightly
unmanned by the sudden double demand upon me, and the pushing
out into the blackness and the brine. (By the way, is the Thames
salt at Putney? I appeal to those who may have gone through the
tasting process in this pºrtion of the stream.) -
At the word “Go!” I heard the painters suddenly cast adrift, as
mine had been, and then, as one after another of the j
sixteen dropped his oar heavily into the water, I felt that this woul
indeed be a struggle for supremacy between the rival Alma Matres.
From the glance I had had at the crew stripped for their prelimi-
nary tubbings, I knew they were in hard condition-every ounce
of convertible flesh consolidated intomuscle, though it might befresh-
water muscle, which is acknowledged to be inferior to the salt-water
variety. As we neared the Oil Works, my fine ear told me that in
the Cambridge boat the crew , were backing up their captain at
thirty-six strokes to the minute straight from the shoulder, while
in the Oxford craft the lively and irregular splashing spoke volumes
(of Thames water) in favour of the high feather of the crew, and
the general liveliness of the ship from stem to stern. The sparks
from sixteen cigarettes flashed along the water like fireflies over the
Maremma, while an occasional rocket from the rival coaches, which
dashed along the towing-path as fast as four horses could carry
them, gaye a romantic aspect to a scene which only required gas-
light to be a magnificent display of that combination of aquatics
and athletics to which the best minds and bodies of our University
youth are so perseveringly directed. By particular request of the
coxswains, I make known my whereabouts from time to time º
whistling the favourite air, “The Same Old Game” as I dashe
a-head, taking the water t of one and then of the other crew,
much to the satisfaction of both, for they were already shipping
more of the Thames fluid than was agreeable with the thermometer
at freezing-point, and the sun not * et. Neck and neck, the
eights of Oxford and Cambridge flashed by the Aits of Thames,
taking, however, care, as they shot past Hurlingham, not to kill
any of yesterday's wounded, as not being members of that distin-
guished club. By this time, could one see it, the elegant bridge of
Barnes ought to be looming in the distance. (I do not know what
“looming ” is, and should be glad of private information.) -
Here a check was given (I did not wonder; for to judge by their
state of perspiration, our athletes must have dropped several pounds
since the start), owing to a spin which both boats took in the middle
of the river, till this was put a stop to by the combined efforts of
strokes and coxswains; but, as there was not a soul on the towing-
path, no notice was taken of the contretemps. I was amusing
myself by half-feathering under the water, when I was *ś
aware of the first streaks of dawn; and as I hoisted the Ro
Standard, and loaded the “Come in" gun, I could hear, not far be-
hind me, though I dared not turn my head to watch, the exciting
...:” which my eye, hand, and shot were so soon to decide and to
record.
In the Oxford Boat, No. 6 had by this evidently finished his share
of the race altogether; and was watching at his ease the jº.
of his comrades, No. 4 was sliding too rapidly, but this might have
been eaused by the accumulation of ice on his seat, owing to the
early start with the thermometer below the freezing-point, and
could scarcely have been prevented, -
In the Cambridge Boat No. 3 had got so well forward over his
toes that he could not get back at all, greatly to the inconyenience
of No. 2, whom he might be said to reduce to cºmparative inaction.
Never at a loss, the Cambridge coxswain, taking the yoke-lines
between his teeth, suddenly brought all his strength to bear in aid
of his almost exhausted stroke, and lifting the boat as they passed the
distance º at the entrance of the last reach, got close to the rails,
and, teeth clenched and hands down, passed the Oxford coxswain,
who had to try all he knew to keep alongside, much less gain on
his opponent. -
The free style in which both the Crews laid out at this late
stage of the struggle was a proof they had not been spending their
strength and money recklessly during their Thames practice.
As Cambridge rounded the bend of Mortlake Reach, the Oxford
stroke, spurted—like a whale in his flurry—till the white water
flashed high over their ship's bows, while the big drops of perspira-
tion gleamed like pearls on the initted brow of the Cambridge
:* as with wild shrieks he urged his crew to a superhuman
eitoru.
I was so excited, as both boats flashed past the Judge's chair in
front of the Ship, that if you had flung a handful of gold into my
lap, I couldn't have told you which had won. No time, however,
was to be wasted in discussing that detail with myself...At a
venture I pulled the trigger of the “Come in " gun, which re-
sponded by a vicious kick that landed me in the bottom of, my
trim-built wherry. A feeble huzza rang from the Ship, in whose
yard a few stragglers were astir even thus early. Up went to the
mast-head the rival flags, both looking blue (but the one dark, the
other light—emblems of the struggle of the moment between night
and day), and, blowing up and out, were at once entangled in a
desperate tussle for º;
I knew there would be a wrangle, and was determined to keep
myself clear of it: so I paddled gently through the railway bridge,
and then, with one turn of the wrist, and that well-known silent
laugh which distinguishes all Pathfinders, shot my skiff to land,
jumped out and returned to town by Underground, leaving the
§: to settle their differences over an amicable breakfast at the

A Volunteer Offer.
. ONE would like to know this “tall gentleman, having lately come
into property,” who advertises in a recent number of the Daily
Telegraph :-
AJOR.—WANTED to purchase, the TITLE of Major or Colonel in a
Volunteer regiment, by a tall gentleman, recently having come into
property.—Address, with lowest price, &c. -
This would-be Major evidently thinks that when purchase was
driven from the Army, it found an asylum in the Wolunteers.
Acceptance and Resignation.
THE Post announces that the vacant office of Black Rod has been
accepted by GENERAL SIR. W. KNoLLys. Attached to it is a resi-
dence within the Palace of Westminster and a salary of £2000 per
annum. Butchers' meat maintaining its present prices, and fashions:
continuing as extravagant as they are now, two thousand a year
will go only a little way to make both ends meet. , Still, considered
as an agreeable addition to the means of housekeeping, it may
be sufficient to make SIR. W. K. especially as Usher, instead of
school-boy, take the rod and be thankful. |

OR, THE BOTTOMRY BOND !
A NAUTICAL Novel, By
S. PL-MS-LL., M.P.
CHAPTER WI.-Dead Eyes and Shrouds.
Yes, WILLIAM and MARY MAYBUD were on board the doomed ††
whose fate had been settled by the Bottomry Bond, signed, sealed,
and delivered between the Stevedore and the Warden.
For days and days in calm weather they sailed.
The Captain, as I have said, a lad of ſº seventeen, was joyous
and careless. In the evening, he played the fiddle, not tunefully,
but merrily, while Polly, as she was now termed, sang º:

as larks in the morning.

five hands, the two steerage wheels, and that was all.
Where were WILLIAM TAILLEUR and Polly
Alas! they had disappeared.
CHAPTER WII.-Land at Last.
Now my task is nearly done. -
WILLIAM and Polly were subsequently picked up by the Purser
whose boat was a four-oar, manned and steered by that useful
person the Mate with five hands, to whom the Government subse-
quently gave a handsome reward. - -
Then they fixed the two steerage wheels to the Captain's gig, and,
having found a quiet animal, they drove overland to England. .
WILLIAM arrived at LLoyd's just in time to see the Committee
before closing for the day, and, on his representation, a Policeman
was sent down to arrest the Stevedore and the Junior Warden.
I would I had the graphic power of MM. ERCKMANN-CHATRIAN
(as I have once before observed in my Pamphlets, having long ago
felt a twist for novel writing"), and I would describe the agony of
the Stevedore, and the remorse of the wicked old, Warden,
who bargained for mercy, by offering to disclose the secret
of MARY MAYBUD's
parentage.

heard the case (MR.
O'Dowd, the Coun-
sel of the Board of
Trade, appeared for

The jº. skipped, and the Ship's Husband danced. The Mate
with five hands performed several amusing tricks of legerdemain.
Yet they were not happy. Polly sent home two letters by the
stern-post, of which we may hear more by-and-by.
At three bells on a cloudy morning they sighted what they made
out to be the Pharo Isles on the coast of Egypt.
The Steward, however, felt certain that it was an immense Bank.
The Purser, pleased at this information—for he had a quantity of
paper which he wished to change for gold—put off in a small boat
and made for the Bank. At the same time, there being some
inequality on board, the Mate took a pair of ship's scissors and
began trimming the cargo.
Before the Purser could return, indeed before he could reach his
destination, the Mate's action had brought about the long-dreaded
catastrophe; for the grain, which had gradually been rising, sud-
denly burst all limits, forced the planks of the upper deck until the

den confided to His
Lordship that MARY
MAYBUD was his

daughter. . . .
His Lordship was
not astonished, as
he thought he had
lost a daughter some
time ago, and was
delighted to find
himself mistaken.:
So the Spanish
Stevedore was
handed over to his
own Government,
and hung at Cor-
dova. The Junior
Warden was fined,
disgraced, and ban-
ished. He never
returned.

LEUR was subse-

then, in consequence
of the valuable
lights he was able
to throw upon all
matters of maritime interest, he was made a Peer (taking precedence
of the Chain Pier and the Old Pier at Brighton), with a seat in the
Lighthouse under the style and title of the EARL of SHIPsbEAcons-
FIELD. MARY is a Countess. And that's all.
Ye who read this, help me to do my best to destroy the
homicidal system, and never let the two, thousand working-men of

who don't know a bow from a keel, or a jib from a forecastle, and

more disinterested and fº them, I say, never forget what
I have done, what I will do, for the sailor's .*. and let them
eyer, and always, send me to the House as their Member—honest,

love may tell, let them remember me, the Author of All in the
Downs; or, the Bottomry Bond!

Note. —By an

orted in our

one. We need

Punch never
indul §es in
“nips,” even on
the most artistic
invitation. It
was Mr. P.'s
Art-Critic who
took Mr. Punch's
name and nips on
- - - that occasion.)
With faint reminiscences of having been knocked a little out of
time in “Round One” by the hospitality of his numerous Artist
friends, your Reporter comes up smiling for “Round Two.”
But with every desire to stick to his business, get through as
many frames, and knock off as many canvases, as fime would allow,
Studios are now so broadcast that it was difficult for your Reporter,
before starting for his second round, to settle, without Ordnance Map
or Bradshaw, whether it would be best to take, first, the Boilers of
Brompton, the GravelPits of Kensington, or the Wood of St. John, and
whether to callen route betweenthese great Art-centres on the Halkin
Mews Hamateurs, the Langham. Lazzaroni, or the, Ham d
Humorists, as occasion and cabs might decide, or whether, but no
matter; these are details of topographical economy which interest
you little and me less, as my travelling expenses concern our
respected proprietors, and money is no object to them, while my
time is their money. -
By the way, I promised my friend MR., STACEY MAREs a visit
before the reciprocal flatteries, exchanged between our Critic and
. Painters had got into his head, and rendered hisjudgment less
absolutely to be depended on.
Another palace!. Gad! Sir, these Artists live on the fat of the
land. Their painting-jackets are of Genoa velvet, their breakfast
china marked with the six marks of the Hang Dynasty or the flower
of the Ho-S potteries, and their smallest piece of furniture a
priceless gem of Boulê, GQUTHIER, or CHIPPENDALE.
In an easy attitude before his easel, suiting his colours to his
palette, and haying a brush with his canvas in a frame of mind
that appeared º º with his subject, I discovered
my friend (I never saw him before, but I presume a friend of yours
is a friend of his) deeply occupied with the noble picture he will
soon exhibit on the Academy walls. I told you it was “Old King
Cole and his Fiddlers Three.” That was only my fun! The real
title is “Strutt's Sports in a Back Room in Wardour Street.” . The
eminent archaeologist is sitting in º shoes on the top of a black
oak wardrobe, practising cup-and-ball, while a circle of stuffed
birds look on admiringly from below. The shoes are full of int,
and the flamingoes bursting with life and tow. The art of MARKs
is already so profoundly impressed with the marks of Art, (this
looks like tautology—but I am liable to fits of gush occasionally,
and require the application of a key down my back, and a few drops
of chloral to arrest the flow) that I forget where I was. Oh!
remember. MARKS-six Marks. No; that was at WHISTLER's.
STACEY (I call him. STACEY now that we seem to have known each
other so long and so intimately) treated me with marks of hospitality
and affection I shall always remember—in fact, until we renew them
next season, and, as we hobnobbed in a flagon of H ras, topped
up with a beaker of hot lambswool, “Ifackins !” I cried, “I would
more of thy *H.; bully MARKs! By cock and pye thine is
right merrie fellowship.” This may have sounded absurd, for I
am not aware the Painter eyer was at the University, but he has
at least taken a high degree in Art, and deservedly so.
But on to pastures new. Thinks I, I should like a smell of the
briny, a whiff of the sea breezes, which I have no time to seek in
their native pewter at Brighton, Margate, or Southend. #.
#: I'll get it! By Hook, answers Echo, and I am off at Echo's

and all in search of the “true and blue and ever free.” Lobster-
pots, trawls, kedges, jiggers, and dog-fish literally litter the floor;
and as I watch the herring-boats or Lowestoft yawls dancing on the
canyas right and left, I get a smack in my eye such as only Harwich
or Hook could impress with as much effect upon their pupils. I
}. at once aboard the painter's craft, and thence, after a re-
freshing plunge into the wild sea waves, followed up by a “water-
bite” of a dozen oysters (real natives, “Ang Low Dutch!” as I said
to my friend H.), and a nip of smuggled brandy, I let go the painter,
and ſº Hook it,
With_my appetite for sea air only stimulated by this nibble at a
Hook, I bore away aboard my Hansom, chartered for the day's
cruise, up Campden Hill, and was soon hitching my trousers and
dowsing my tarpaulin in the presence of H. MooRE. Here’s a
breeze, Sir! Here’s a bouquet of sea-beach Here’s an air—now
crescendo, now rallentando–of wavelets making a creamy ripple on
the beach. . (I am not quite clear if that is mine or the Laureate's ;
if it isn't A.T.’s, he is welcome to it, and can fit it into his next
sea-idyl.) “MooRE, and still MooRE,” I cry, until I begin so to
believe in the “Fresh Breezes” and “Rolling Swells,” that had
not my kind entertainer brought me a #.". in which cognac
predominated over seltzer, I verily believe he must have brought
me a basin. It was all the gifted artist could do to prevent me
taking a header into one of his freshly-painted waves. Tº Breakers
ahead!” thought I, and after another final gulp of his refreshing briny,
I retired gracefully and sought another clime—I should say climb-
for I had to ascend the Hill of Notting, cross the Vale of Maida,
and seek the classical temple of ALMATADEMA, by the northern
gate of the Grecian-porticoed park of the Late Regent, and almost
under the classic shadow of the Hill of Primrose. A palace! an
imperial monument l complete from the Cave Canem at the door to
the Gladiator's helmet worn by the butler, who took my hat and
hung it on the spear of Pallas Promachos which adorns the vestibule.
Here I got so hopelessly mixed up with matrons in Tyrian-dyed
hair, babies wearing the bulla, and slaves playing on the discobolos,
the carchedon, and the kithara, that I had scarcely wits left to
distinguish between the real and the unreal, between the Gallo-
Greek and the Hispano-Mauresque, between the symposium on the
luncheon-table and the banquet on the easel. A witching Bacchante,
who had been arranging mosaic tesserae into multitudinous patterns,
left her puzzle and her play to press an amphora of Falernian to my
eager lips. I felt I was growing classical; my hair was cropping
into a “Titus;” my Ulster was folding itself into a toga; and I
caught myself irºi. to arrange into º one of the five classical
orders the imperfect memories of a public school education, as
seizing a barbiton from the wall, I burst, by way of expressing m
thanks, into a quotation from HoRACE (tesselated, it may be, but a
the more classical for that), something to the following effect, as
well as I can remember:—
“Qdi profanum, puer, apparatus!
Wulgus et arceo, filia pulchrior-
Dic Utrúm mavis accipe, Tadéma, aut
ALMATADEMA.”


“Won't scan and construe?” All I know is I made it scan then,
if you can't now; and as to construing, any wise man can put his
own construction on anything. No hyper-criticism, if you please.
By Pol and Hercules I that Falernian was first-class, and must
have been amphoraed consule Planco 4-bottled in PLANCUs's time,
PLANcus must have been a right good, fellow—the PLANCHé of
the period, I dare say—herald, antiquarian, dramatist, and poet;
so’s ALMA ToDDY—TADDY—what's his name?—
How I got out of this round without throwing up the sponge, is
quite incomprehensible. But to resume—"
* We regret to have to add that the Sergeant Commissionnaire employed
I|by our worthy Publisher, who happens to be a householder, was called on,
at a late hour, to bail our Art-Critic out of the Primrose Hill Station-House,
whither he had been brought in a wild state ºf classical and Bacchanalian
elevation, shouting “Evoe l’ and “Io Bacche!” which the Police Sergeant
on duty construing into a call for tobacco, he had kindly sent out for a two-
ounce packet of WILLs's Best Bristol Bird's-Eye, and a clean pipe. A card
discovered in our Art-Critic's pocket, with the address of our office, led to the
application to our worthy Commissionnaire already mentioned. Our Art-
Critic has not yet come up to time for “Round Third.”

the screening of their real ends, for the which it do seem to me that
one set of words would serve as well as another. But 'tis the business
of diplomacy to fashion such screens; so no wonder hº of the craft
do make much ado about what is writ upon them. Only to plain
folks out-of-doors methinks it must needs seem that it do matter
little. I sorry to learn that SIR HENRY ELLIOT is sick, but glad that
he shall not go back at once to Constantinople; and, indeed, I could
find in my heart to wish he may never go back thither, for methinks
one so weak were better elsewhere, seeing your Turk do need a
strong hand in them that have the dealing with him. Besides 'tis a

speech and carriage, though mighty pleasant, and would do well
enough, I doubt not, in another place. Afterwards my Lords did
talk at large on Cattle Plague, and Law Schools, and Inns of Court,

be to be kept out. And methinks I had rather, if we must have
strange meat, that it came over dead, than alive, and bring the
plague with it.
| Ido learn from UNDER-SECRETARY Bourke that SIR HENRY ELLIOT
be to be let down by degrees—one being sent in his place, at first,
as if for a while only. Only I do not think in my heart the

give him many good words, which I would not have him be-

what most would have had him, which is nothing. -
My LoRD CHARLEs BEREsford, a mighty brisk young Captain,
that I do like to hear speak for his fiery spirit, did no little content
me to-night by his brave talk of Torpedoes; And indeed I do now
think to understand them better than I had ever hoped to do with-
out seeing; and strange weapons they do seem, and nasty, and able
to blow a great ship to pieces as it were in a whiff. I $o at last
know that they are of several sorts; some to be laid under water,
like our land petards, and fired by the passage of a ship above them;
and others to be carried in boats within reach of the ship they be to
strike; but the most devilish to be launched from aboard the ship that
carries them, and to run by their own º: wer and their own
steerage, and at any depth that they may be ballasted for, and so go
straight at the enemy's ship like a bull-dog at a bull, and at the first
touch burst, and blow the biggest ship to the bottom, and no help.
And though I did always j. how men should be found so mad
to go to sea when they could stay ashore, I do now wonder at this
more than ever, with such diabolique engines both aboard our
ships of war and ready for launching against them by others. So

were, for sale of such infernal inventions, when we might, for a little
money, have them all to ourselves.
Then the House did vote more than Two and a Half Millions for
Seamen's Wages, at which I did wonder, to think how hard we used
to be put to it, in my time, to get a few poor Thousands. But, indeed,
it do seem the country is grown rich, in money, that all the Offices
may have it’ſor the asking; only the difficulty is in the right spend-
ing of it, and how to get the needful kind of virtuoso officers to
manage the engines aboard our ships; and to that end MR. WARD
HUNT do propose some, peddling measures, but nothing fitting our
need. And, indeed, all in this matter do seem alike at a non-plus,
and cannot yet find the right men. And yet England, that they
call the world's workshop, ought to furnish such men easiest; and
I doubt not could, if the Office could but hit the right way to get
them. There. was also a vote, taken to-night for more than a
Million, for Victualling and Clothing, which do as much amaze me
as the monstrous sum for pay., And to think no gifts to them in the
Office out of it all!. Which is hardest of all for me to believe. And
a sorry thing methinks for them in the Office.
Tuesday.-My Lords up at half-past five, after some talk of Rail-
way. Accidents and Retirement of Army Officers—two hard nuts to
crack, were the best teeth in my Lords' best heads set to them.
(Commons.)-One MR. REGINALDYoRKE did move an Address to
the Crown to issue a Commission to Inquire into all Matters touching
the Stock Exchange, and the business and usages thereof, which is
indeed a new thing since my time, and, it do seem, is used chiefly
for the getting on and off the market of Bubble Loans and Com-
panies, whereof your clever rogues do make rare pickings out of
the losses of simple honest folk. And SIR. C. RUSSELI, did amaze me,
showing how Twenty States did now owe us 305 Millions of money
lent, and 40 Millions arrears of interest.
But MR. ALDERMAN Corton, and MR. STANHOPE, and others were
against inquiry, for that the said Exchange was a need of the times.
As I do see it is, and that without it many clever rogues would be
cast out of a livelihood; and they do plead that there be good
schemes promoted thereby as well as bad ones; and, indeed do
knowithat 'tis hard for the law to come between simple, fools and
sharp knaves, and so said SIR STAFFORD NoKTHCOTE, and did give
good reasons against such inquiry, but, nevertheless, did end §
agreeing to it, which amazed me, that a grave man like him shoul
give such good reasons against his own action; and I do indeed
think this be one of those things whereof the saying goes—"the
more you, stir it, the more it stinks”—yet the House, I believe,
was for stirring it, so the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER was fain
to yield, but methinks did it not with a good grace. And, indeed
I had thought SIR STAFFORD a weightier and wiser man than he did
seem to-night.
But, lord! to hear how your sharp rogues do thrive by these bubble-
blowings, and what a state they keep! And how of these pestilent
bubbles, one will burst every now and then, and let the hoised
knaves that blew it down of a sudden, and then a great stir and a
scandal, but soon forgotten. All which I would have otherwise;
and had rather see things as in my time, when indeed we did pick
and steal handsomely enough in the Offices, and did think little of
cheating the King, but had no such mighty making of money by
right-down roguery under the name of business as I do see in this
town now-a-days. And while this is so, methinks 'tis hard to see
what good can come of inquiring how the rogues do go about their
knavery, for that to shut one way to them is most times but to
open another.
Wednesday. — MR. BUTT did move his Irish Land Tenure Bill
for enabling Tenants to hold the lands º: their Landlords so
long as they should pay their rents. But the House would none of it
by 322 to 84. And Pdo wonder how any one should be bold enough

to bring in such a Bill in a House º, of landowners. But I do
think this Bill is one not meant to pass, but only to please the more
ignorant Irish out of the House, like many of the Bills of MR. BUTT.
But methinks he must, indeed, be ready to throw such tubs to the
whales, or he would not bear rule at home, nor brook Home-Rule as
he do. But as for the prosperity of Ulster, which MR. BUTTºdo place
on its law of land, I do rather, by all I can learn, hold it to come of
the Scotch blood brought in there through KING JAMEs's Plantation
of that part of Ireland, which hath marvellously sobered your wilder
Irish solt, so that I would KING JAMEs had so planted all Ireland.
Thursday (Lords).-My LoRD DUDLEY mighty ...]". upon
the Protocol, and the emptiness thereof, and the need of some care
and thought for the Christians under the Turk, and how he would
not have SIR HENRY ELLIOT go back to Constantinople, for that he
was all for the Turk. And so did draw down a sharp rap from my
LoRD DUKE of SoMERSET, and most from my LoRD DERBY, that
would not any Lord should speak strongly on such matters, seeing
it is his way to do nothing and to say as little as may be ; and hath
till now succeeded wondrous well therein, and will abide by it.
In the Commons were many questions, but only work on the
Prisons Bill, wherein I do see CRoss is one that not only means well
but do better than most; and I'much contented with his carriage of
all matters about his Bill to-night.

grace. It would be too hard to put the School-Board (to whom Iowe
all my technical knowledge and accomplishments) to open shame! It
must not be l—nay, it shall not be
The sun having, now sunk behind the distant horizon, the
Coastguardsman gathered up his sketching materials, and returned
to his watch-tower. . He had hardly opened a scientific work upon
ſº when the signal-bell of the telegraphic apparatus informed
him that a message was on, its road. In a moment he was at the
instrument, anxiously waiting for information.
“A despatch from the Admiralty!” he exclaimed, as the needles
Hº I-
moved rapidly from side to side. And then he repeated the message
word for word—“War is declared. Keep a sharp look-out. The
enemy's fleet is—” He could read no more, for the needles sud-
denly stopped; and further examination convinced him that the
Wire * communication between his office and Whitehall had been
severeol.
“What shall I do?” he asked himself in an undertone. And
then he listened. The sounds of horses' hoofs striking the hard,
flinty road without, reached his eager ears. Rapidly arming himself,
he rushed out, and formed himself (as well as the resources at his
command would permit) into a hollow square. He waited patiently
for a few minutes, and, hearing nothing more, extended himself in
skirmishing order. The last movement had the desired effect. A
regiment of Uhlans appeared, and were rapidly demolished by the
Gatling gun he had brought with him for the purpose.
“It is lucky that I have the Field Exercises at my fingers'-ends,”
he murmured.. “Without the knowledge culled from the Red Book,
I could never have performed these manoeuvres with such success
and steadiness.”
..But once more silence reigned around. No longer able to restrain
his impatience to learn the worst he took from the pocket of his
rough sailor's coat a small mortar, and loaded it wi -cotton
and a parachute shell. In another moment the sea and land for
miles round were illuminated with a brilliant light.
“As I expected,” he observed, with a grim smile.
fleet is in the offing.” -
He could say no more, for immediately the air became thick with
shells, which rapidly exploded in the most * manner. The
$.º. without any, unnecessary delay; threw himself
upon his face, and crawled back, like a serpent, to his tower, which
was of course subterranean.
Once in this place of security he approached an instrument con-
nected with the telegraphic apparatus, which looked somewhat like
an old harpsichord. pidly sweeping his fingers over the keys
immediately the distant sea was convulsed in many places. He had
fired the sunken torpedoes. Then he crawled above ground, and by
the light of the moon, which had now risen, ascertained, with the
assistance of a telescope, that a couple of dozen Iron-clads had been
blown to atoms. A distant cheer informed him, however, much to
his chagrin, that only a portion of the enemy's fleet had been
destroyed.
“I must get out my 200-ton gun,” he murmured, angrily. “And
then good-bye to my studies for to-night.”
Crawling stealthily to a hidden boathouse, he crept into what
seemed to be a floating gun-carriage propelled by steam. On a
lucifer being º to the fuel, r }. in the furnaces, the
machine immediately got * steam, and, º; its own
smoke, left the shore. The floating gun-carriage lay low in the
water, and was painted to represent a miniature wave. At a few
ards' distance the boat could not be distinguished from the water.
y, turning a few handles, and steering cleverly, he was able to load
and fire his formidable weapon a dozen times, and each shot de-
molished an Iron-clad. Again he loaded and fired, but at length
without effect. The floating fortress had conquered the floating gun.
His weapon had at last become valueless.
Nothing daunted, he put some more fuel into the furnace, and
increased the speed of his little craft. When he was within a
thousand yards of the remainder of the enemy's fleet, he lowered a
dozen floating cases like gigantie eigars, lighted their łases, and the
cases instantaneousl Plunged under water.
“It is rather cruel,” he murmured, “but it can’t be helped.”
In another minute and a half, twelve of WHITRHEAD's torpedoes
had been exploded, and the remaining Iron-clads were reposing
in pieces at the bottom of the sea.
Thoughtfully the Coastguardsman returned to his, subterranean
tower. He rushed to his desk, and dashed off, with the aid of a
type-writer, a brilliant account of his proceedings. He had taken
seven impressions at once. The original he put in an envelope for
the Admiralty; the copies were addressed to the Editors of the
leading journals.
Then he mounted a bicycle, and, after half an hour's ride, found
the severed wire. He connected the metal with his pocket instru-
ment, and telegraphed to London, “The enemy's ships accounted for:
Send divers *} early train to-morrow to raise them, for the sake of
the old iron. The Lords of the Admiralty are respectfully informed
that they can now retire to rest with easy minds.” -
Then the Coastguardsman º: his letters, and, having in-
effectually swept the sea with his glass to discover if it were
H. to save any of the crews in his steam life-boat, returned to
is towe
s r.
Here, tired with his d exertions, he set his alarum at
a quarter to five, played Rule Britannia (with some brilliant
yariations) on his violin, wrapped himself in the Union Jack, and
. a few moments was enjoying the sleep that follows upon duty
One.

“A CLUB TO THE RESCUE.”
xcELLENT MR.
PUNCH,
You are in-
variably so very
kind to Ladies,
that I cannot help
asking you ..for
your opinion
about the new
Tournament Club.
Do you know it is
to be so grand P
The object of the
Club is the “re-
vival of chivalric
sports under dis-
tinguishedpatron-
age.” There's to
be quintain and
tilting at thering,
and the prizes are
to be given away
by a Queen of
Beauty, Another
chivalric sport is
to be “five o'clock
tea from three to
half-past six dur-
ing the season.”
only fear is, that if

sort, isn't it? The poor boy rides a good many stones more than he
did a few years ago. For all that É. is quite too awfully charm-
ing, and I certainly should not permit him to receive a prize
from any Queen of Beauty but—Well, my modesty won't allow
me to say any more. And that reminds me—how are the Queens of
Beauty to be chosen? If the Ladies are put up for ballot, and
elected by their own sex, none of them will ever be taken.
“Tilting at the ring” being permitted, I suppose is a delicate
way of saying that flirtation won’t be forbidden. But really. I think
the Tournament will be quite too dangerous, and just a little bit
ridiculous... I see that the Committee want to find a town house,
Don't you think they had better fir their head-quarters at ASTLEy's?
Believe me, my dear Mr. Punch,
Yours most affectionately,
A CLEVER LITTLE Wom AN.
The Boudoir, Bayswater.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(He addresses the Editor, erpresses his sincere regret, and
announces a courageous intention.)
SIR,
. I CANNOT explain how grieved I am to have been compelled,
by circumstances over which I have not now, nor ever shalſ have,
any control, to absent myself from the gay Metropolis at what is the
very Preface of the Season. His º Highness has been with
you, but I have not... Now he leaves you for a little tour—which I
sincerely trust he will enjoy; and I am with you for a few weeks,
just to start the Season, and then * to horse, and away!
My chief regret, I own, is that I have been unable to see Haska
at Drury Lane—that Spicerian Drama which has engaged the atten-
tion of “the gentlemen of the Long Robe,” and advertised itself at
some considerable expense to the Author,
But I have seen the Picture, up in front of Drury Lane, repre-
senting, in beautifully bright colours, a young Fº: presumably
Haska the Heroine, about to throw herself out of a large window
while a gentleman, evidently, belonging to the upper classes, 9
foreign º and "...i. Åing Belshazzar in the old-
fashioned c. dren's picture-books, and the conventional Richard
the Third, is standing in an attitude of surprise, not unmingled
with indignant disgust—at least such was the impression conveyed
to my mind by his deep-pink-blush face. From behind the arras
issues a crowd of armed men rushing out, either to seize the foreign
nobleman (taking him unawares while in this state of blushing in-
dignation), or to prevent Haska from committing what the police
reports would term “the rash act.”
it I have no time to dilate on the artistic composition, which will
not (unless I am misinformed) be in this year's Academy.
All I have to say is this, that Iregret my inability to witness the
performance of the play, unless it runs over Easter. If it does, then
I am there—representing you, Sir, I am all there. If it does not,
then as Drury Lane is to be let very soon, I am half-inclined to hire
it for one night; with MR. SPICER's assistance, merely to represent
Baska to a select audience, only no one will be admitted who has not
previously provided himself with a voucher signed by three Peeresses
in their own right, and by H.R.H., for HER MAJESTY. Then, per-
haps, I may allow them to come in on payment of five sovereigns,
and no given. -
However, that project is in nubibus or in boobibus at present,
though I am open to an offer. - -
No, Sir, I have made up my mind, and when I have finished my
packing I am going to ride to Khiva, or somewhere else. I do not wish
to cut out my gallant friend CAPTAIN BURNABY ; no, far from it. But
to Khiva I º go, my boys, to Khiva I will go, I don't know, where
it is, and I don't care; that makes the ºiń. more perilous (as
I might take the wrong turning to begin with), and my conduct the
more ...; I think I shall open a subscription, list., . There are
lots of people want me to go away-I mean to ride to Khiva, and to
see what it's like before they attempt it themselves. I’ve often
“ridden to cover” (or Kiver, as the Cockneys would callit); but I’ve
never done Khiva. -
No matter, particulars as to subscriptions will be soon started in
this Journal, and at Khiva, or elsewhere, mounted or on foot, believe
me always to be YoURREPRESENTATIVE.

The Checkers (Spellin Reform Crib), Wensday,
On finding the fragments of an Egg upon the Chair of
Vice-Chancellor Malins,
HENs sit, and Judges sit—'tis fair to match 'em,
Since one has lately given much pains to Hatcham,
And laid a yoke (some say) on our Theology:
But this egg surely had its nest mistaken.

And every one has heard of Eggs and BAcon.
How then account for this misplaced ovation?
Why thus ! Our memory may have its failings—
But we account for it by this quotation,
“Abovo usque ad (Flacco pace) MAL-INs,”
A Novel Case,
“At Taunton Assizes, yesterday, before MR. Justice Hawkins, JAMES
SLEEP, station-master at Wellow, was charged with the ughter of
ELIZABETH EDGE and twelve other persons, who were killed in the Radstock
Railway accident, owing to his having started a train on a single line when
another was due in the opposite direction. A sentence of twelve months'
imprisonment was passed.”
We have known of but too many Railway Accidents caused º
want of sleep among the Company’s Servants, but the Radstoc
accident is the only instance weever heard of, of an accident caused
by one SLEEP too many among those in the Company's employment.

ECHOES FROM THE STAMBOUL ST. STEPHEN’S.
FIRST SITTING.
“Whatever may be said in praise of the grand Audience Hall of the Dolma-
Baghtché, its acoustic properties must be left out of the commendation. An
echo worse than that which necessitated the use of a velarium, in a certain
hall, on the western outskirts of the British capital, resounds through the
great chamber of the marble palace on the Bosphorus. No such expedient as
a velarium having suggested itself to the authorities exercising control over
the proceedings, the Secretary's utterances were nearly unintelligible. The
Speech, which was very long, gave a history of the formation of the Turkish
Constitution, insisted on the necessity of reform, enumerated many laws, and
specially promised a review of the financial position of Turkey.”
Daily Telegraph.
OH, a fig for the Speech! Mr. Punch's sharp ear
as a-cock for that Echo; an Echo as queer
As ever a Pat answered patly.
Its report was the thing that the Sage overheard,
Whilst the Deputies squatted in postures absurd,
And on ears of which few comprehended one word
The SULTAN's palaver fell flatly.
And what, as he gazed on those smoke-puffing ranks,
Did Mr. Punch hear? Well, a turning of cranks—
A sort of queer clockworky grinding;
As though an automaton caucus were there,
X: stiff in the joints and much out of repair,
And a Showman, unused to the work, with all care
Were the motive machinery winding.
He heard a .# sound, too, half chuckle half groan,
Above the wigged Speaker's monotonous drone
she summarised, promised, exhorted:
And, I-well, Mr. Punch from mis-statement would shrink,
But if such a thing as a general wink
Might be rendered in sound, he’d be tempted to think
That also the Echo reported.
Then he thought he heard History shaking her head
At the SULTAN’s “historical facts,” as 'tis said
She would do, in old days, at DISRAELI.
Then a chorus of Bondholders howled in his ear
At the Padishah's views of finance; one may fear
As a GLADSTONE's or GoscHEN's they were not so clear,
Though glibly reeled out, if not gaily.
When he spake of Reform that rude Echo laughed loud;
But the mirth seemed to struggle with groans from the crowd
Of Slav millions yet ruled from the Bosphorus.
“Reform ' " wailed the voices, “when Pashas still sway,
With legions of Bashi-Bazouks in their pay,
And Policy bids us with patience to stay,
ºft. the diplomates play pitch-and-toss for us?”
When the thanks of the SULTAN to Allah arose,
That Echo most surely held finger to nose
(If Echoes have noses and fingers),
So sly and so nasally 'cute was its tone
As it said “Well, suppose we leave Ailah alone,
While murder and lust stain our country's hearth-stone,
And corruption among us still lingers.”
But when the Speech proferred Turk friendship all round,
The Echo returned such a composite sound
Of doubt, indignation, and laughter,
That the Bear-Garden Palace seemed full of the row.
So Punch made the Echo his very best bow,
And left Dolma-Baghtché, not caring, somehow,
To listen to aught that came after.
Stock Exchange REFORM.–Restore the parochial Stocks and
also the Pillory, put the greater rogues amongst the Stock-Specu-

DYING WITH LAUGHTER,
SCENE-The Interior of a Railway Signal-Boz. Small Boy Clerk
discovered Chatting with his Friend.
Small Boy Clerk. It was very good of you, CHARLIE, to come to
cheer me up a bit. After twelve hours' duty one gets awfully
lonely. (Electric signal-bell rings.)
Charles (his Friend). I say, §§ Man, don't you think you ought
to find out what they want at the next station? That's the fourth
time that blessed bell has been set a-ringing!
Small Boy Clerk, Oh! it’s only some chaff or other. They are
always up to their tom-foolery.
Train dashes past.
Charles. Hallo! what's that?
Small_Boy, Clerk (scratching his head). Well, I don't exactly
know. It’s either the mail, or an extra special, or the relief. , You
see, while I was talking to you — (Signal-bell rings.) Confound
that fellow—there he is up to his pranks again!
Charles. I say, oughtn't you to see what it's all about? Come,
show us how you work the thing.
Small Boy Clerk. All right! Look here! You take the handles
like this, and work 'em so.
Charles. What does he want?
Small Boy Clerk, Oh! some bosh about when the train's left.
He's always at his nonsense. Just you take the handles, and work
'em so. (Charles obeys.) There, that will shut him up!
Charles. What have you telegraphed P
Another Train dashes past.
Small Boy Clerk (laughing). Oh, it means “All right!”
Charles. But, I say, supposing the line's blocked?
Small Boy Clerk. Well, then it will serve him jolly well right
for playing the fool. And now tell us that story that you began
just now.
A third Train dashes past,
Charles. Well, it was great, larks!...You see we got the dog
quietly down to the back of the public, and there we met BILL
SIMMONDs. Says BILL, “Is the match on ?” “Yes,” says I, “if
you can only get big enough rats.”
Two more Trains dash past.
Small Boy Clerk º That was a good un! But stay a
moment; I don't understand these trains. I’ve been so long on
duty I'm getting quite confused. (Telegraphs.) There, now I have
asked him what’s the matter. (Needles work.) . There, what did I
tell If: ?—he's * playing the fool. He's answered back,
“All right!” Well, I can't help it. Go on. If the rats are only
big enough—yes?
Charles. So ToMMY comes up and says, says he, “Call that a dog?
º: he's more like an elephant.” Well of course we all roared
at that.
*Another Train dashes past.
Small Boy Clerk (shouting with merriment). Well I never! And
what did BILL say to that?
Charles. Well of course this made BILL very shirty, so he says,
says he— (Violent ringing of the signal-bell.) Hallo! what's
the row now P
Small Roy Clerk (at telegraph). Oh, nothing very much—only a
fatal accident. We have lots of 'em on our line. Go on.
Charles. And BILL says, says he, “I’ll eat myself and the
elephant too if it ain't SAMMY's old bull terrier l’”
[Scene closes in, amidst peals of laughter.
SAVE THE CHILD
THE Third Schedule of the Education Code, 1877 (Needlework),
requires the following from Infants, age three to five:-
“Position drill, hemming, simple, on strips, beginning with black cotton,
rising to red, and going on to blue.
Hemming, simple and counter, to show any garment which can be made
entirely by these, e.g., a child's common pinafore.”
Imagine a class of thirty infants from three to five, each armed
with a needle, and superintended by a somewhat larger infant in
the shape of a pupil-teacher, aged fourteen, all working out my
Lords' sentence—to make their own #: We all know that
children between these ages look on buttons, peas, and similar small
objects as stoppers for the nose and ears, and on thimbles and
marbles as nourishing things to swallow. who can say what may
be the consequences of "...iſ these enterprising little experi-
mentalists with pins and needles? Perhaps it is to prevent any
catastrophe from this marvellous regulation that the KHEDIVE
of Egypt has chosen this moment to make the British nation a present
of Cleopatra's Needle, which is big enough to do all the sewing for
all the elementary schools of the kingdom. But this is not all my
Lords lay down in that way of that stitch in time, which, let us hope,
may save nine hereafter. Children from five to seven are expected to
do “hemming, seaming, felling, pleating, and knitting,” and attwelve
or thirteen to be proficient in all branches of needlework, knitting,
and cutting out. -
If my Lords don't succeed in sewing up the children by these
wonderful regulations, they will the teachers.
Who would be a Governess?
WHAT is the difference between a Servant and a Governess? This
is not a conundrum, but a question that arises after the perusal of
the following advertisement:-
OUSEMAID (young) WANTED, immediately, to assist Governess.
Apply, &c.
The next domestic Wanted will be a Governess to help the House-
maid, or J. the Cook, in her duties, till at last, as education
spreads, Governess becomes synonymous with Maid-of-all-work.

Near-sighted, but hard-riding Gentleman. “Jumped over some FELLow IN THAT Ditch I

MRS. PARTINGTON'S ALLOCUTION.
In humble imitation of that recently fulminated by her Venerable Friend
at the Vatican.
“The Pope pronounced a brief allocution, affirming with greater vehe-
mence the declarations made by him in the allocution of the 12th inst, and
adding that he would raise a protest before the whole world against the
attempt that was being made to deprive him of liberty of ";”
aily Telegraph.
WELL, I pities the Pope, that I does; which his doctrines is down-
right and manly, -
(And not merely moonshine and mist, like the trash of that mealy-
mouthed STANLEY): - -
To hear him a dealing out cusses, and letting fly adjectives—
whoppers!— -
Must comfort and 'stablish true hearts, and give infidel consciences
croppers.
The way us Old Parties is treated is daily becoming more horrid;
In wº § our protests wax louder, our metyfors more and more
oriol.
My broom's no more use than a bullrush; dear PIUs's ban ain't
much stronger;
And as for the old Tory rattle, they daren't even shake it no longer!
The Wº; i. not heed its Old Women, in bombazine, True-Blue,
or Scarlet;
But me, MRs. GAMP, and the Pope, is mere butts for each wicious
young warlet. -
We weeps and deplores and protests, shake our besom, our Bull, or
our gingham,
But cannot to decency drive 'em, nor, much more, to betterment
bring 'em.
They tramples all rights under-foot, like a herd of mad swine-
which they are it!
The hº º: the red revolution sweeps on, and our wailings won't
ar. It.
They prigs all our places and perks, all our prophecies turns into
mockery, -
And smashes up Customs and Creeds, Crowns and Churches, like so
much º Crockery.
They fºrgº iniquitous ties—may they twist into knots as 'll hang
em. --
They laughs when we beg and beseech, and they sets up their backs
when we slang'em; - -
They cuts down our powers and properties ruthless, the bragian
brutes do! -
Tearing up our “beneficent plants,”—which they now is but plants,
—by the roots, too.
Their papers, and pamphlets, and speeches-a plague on the whole
wºkeilot of emi-
Insinivates falsehoods against us, till thousands is gulled by the rot
ot ‘em.
The villanies vomited forth—that's the word—from their platforms
and presses,
Mean mischief in every line, and must end in the awfullest messes.
True # you, my poor Prus! a prisoner, pent by fell foes in the
aticanſ
I sympathise much with your woes, I can feel for your sufferings,
that I can. -
All the world, save ourselves, is gone wrong in its creeds and its
aws and its politics,
And Civilisation's new clock to the tune of delirious folly ticks.
And now they would tie up our tongues, as the werry last weapons
they’ve left us; -
But, drat'em! they shan’t stop our talk, who of all other bliss have
bereft us.
There's comfort in cussing all round—us Old Women it cheers and
rejoices
To know, though our hands they have shackled, they can't put the
gag on our woices.

A GOOD EXAMPLE.
“He [DR. SchLIEMANN] was attracted to the lady who is now MRs. Schlie-
MANN by her ability to translate the ‘Song Divine,’ and has since cultivated
her powers by refusing in their walks to enter upon other subjects before she
had repeated a certain number of lines.”—Times, March 17.
ALREADY we hear from every side of the good effects produced by
this excellent peripatetic example. It is rapidly influencing other
couples. Its beneficial operation upon hearts which know and under-
stand each other can hardly be over-estimated. Here are one or two
instances, selected at random, of its marvellous working in this short
space of time.
MR. and MRs. STANHoPE GATEs regularly when they are in Town
take a walk together every morning in Kensington Gardens after
breakfast. They now enter upon none of the ordinary topics of con-
yersation until MRs. GATEs has recited, to the satisfaction of her
husband, either a scene from SHAKSPEARE, or one of MILTON's
minor º.
MR. MonTAGU TURTLE and Miss JULIET Dove have lately become
engaged, and never miss a day without spending some portion of it
in each other's society. If it is fine, they meet in the Park, or the
“Grove,” or on the Embankment. If the weather is unfavourable
to outdoor mutual adoration, MonTAGU calls at the house of JULIET's
Aunt. He is a devout scholar of CARLYLE and RUSKIN, and it has
now become the inexorable rule that, after the first greetings, not
another word shall be spoken until darling JULIET-the most
amiable girl breathing, but wanting, perhaps, a little cultivation—
has repeated a selected passage from one of the two great authors
justmentioned.
See! MR. and MRs. GREY MAYOR ºf up and down the well-
kept paths of their roomy garden before luncheon. He raises his
sonorous voice, he uses, gesture, emphasis, action! She, a superior
woman, an intellectual being, a keen politician, listens eagerly with
rapt attention to the latest leader on the Peace Negotiations, which
MR. GREY MAYOR has been busy since breakfast learning by heart
in his little study.
Those ... sisters EMMELINE and HERMIon E agreed at once to
convert their daily rides into a source of intellectual enjoyment and
improvement, instead of making them an occasion of frivolous
gossip about parties, amusements, the milliner's art, and butterfly
novels. Between, canters, they repeat to, each other alternately
passages from their favourite poets and philosophers, both home and
foreign; and now and again they rein up their steeds beneath the
stately trees and read translations of some of the choicest examples
of ... diction, and profundity, - -
The young Ladies who are finishing their education under the eye

MRs. SENIOR, sister of THoMAs HUGHEs, Q.C., and daughter-in-
law of the late NAssau W. SENIOR, was appointed by the RIGHT
HoNounable JAMEs STANspeLD, President of the Local Government
Board, first, in February, 1873, temporary Assistant Inspector, and
in January, 1874, permanent. Inspector of the Department, to
inquire, and report, especially, on the female departments of
Workhouses and Workhouse Schools, and the care and education
of femalapauper girls and the nursing of infants. She was forced
§. the illness of which she died to resign this employment in
November, 1874. MRs. SENIOR was the first woman ever employed
in such a capacity.
Not for the bright face we shall see no more,
ot for the sweet voice we no more shall hear:
Not for the heart with kindness brimming o'er,
Large charity, and sympathy sincere.
These are not things that ask a public pen
To blazon its memorial o'er her name;
But, that in public work she wrought with men
And faced their frowns, and over-lived their blame.
Yet never swerved a hair's breadth from the line
Of woman's softness, gentleness, and grace;
But brought from these an influence to refine
Rough tasks and squalid, and there leave its trace.
Honour to him who in a sneering age, -
Braved quip and carp and cavil, and proclaimed
A woman's fitness pauper needs to gauge,
In purpose strong, in purity unshamed.
For paupers too have sex: the workhouse walls
Hold mothers, maidens, and girl-babes, on whom
A woman's eye with woman's insight falls,
Sees its own ways for sunlight to their gloom.
And so this noble and brave lady turned
From glad life, luxury, and thronging friends
That hung on her sweet voice, and only yearned
To guide her holy work to useful ends.
But Death to Life begrudged her, striking down
The task unfinished from her willing hands,
Leaving to women yet to come the crown
Of her left life's-work, that for others stands.
Then lay and leave her in her quiet grave,
Where the sun shines undimmed, the rain falls clear,
And birches bend, and deodaras wave ..
Evergreen arms of welcome o'er her bier.

Y LORD DUKE of RICHMOND did move for a Select Committee (Friday,
March 23, Lords) to inquire into the powers of Commissioners of Sewers,
Drainage and Navigation Boards, and how they might best and cheapest be
set to work for hindering of floods, and storing of waters. Nor, indeed,
before 'tis need thereof, now that, both Thames-side, and so much of the
. Midland parts has been flooded till bodies, have, scarce had dry lying in the
• ' N T . ET. b = u- churchyards, and the spirits, that belonged to them have been, as it were,
but spirits-and-water at best. And, methinks, the Government is this time
for shutting the door strangely soon after the stealing of the horse. Yet 'tis
- but a Select Committee; so that, I doubt not, it will be long enough before
they come to doing *: Only if Englishmen were wise, methinks, between the plagues of too much and too little water, which is
floods and droughts, they would devise means for storage of rains, and so letting either prevent the other. But, strange, how long
it do take to get things first beaten into your Englishman's head, and thence beaten out again into act. -
In the Commons a great stir as of a good bout of buffets, lºoked for, and I in my place, early, and mighty pleased, at the buzzing
about the lobbies and in the House. d most Members did put of their Motions, to make way, for MR. FAwcETT, the blind gentle-
man that cannot see things in his way like another, and, so will not be turned aside, but standeth, the most sturdy to his point I ever
did see. And I like him; for, indeed, there are few such: and a clear, strong speaker withal, and doth not see when men are weary
or angry with his speaking; so hard to #. - - - - - - -
Only before he come to it was but dull talk of the two Members of Chelsea, for giving more Polling-time from eight in the mornin
to eight of the evening. Against which I can see no reason, nor have heard none; and methinks, now so many have votes, it is well
should have the most convenient time to give them, which is after four of the clock for most workmen... I well content the CHANCELLOR

And at last SIR CHARLEs DILKE got aside, but not easily, for he is one that loves to be talking; and no division taken, before Fawcett
come to his speech. And it do me good to hear one so downright in these over trimming and timid times. And do call a spade by its

name as plain as ever I hear; and did so handle this Eastern trouble
that he did make it appear England hath played the most poor and
É. part therein that Government ever had, showing how my LoRD
ERBY had passed his word to bring about better handling for the
Christians under rule of the Turk, and thereunto had used brave,
big words, only no force at the back of them; and so all is fallen
into the hand of the Muscovite, that is for backing a word with a
blow. And, for my H. for anything I do see or hear, I cannot see
how the Turk is to be stirred otherwise. And so this brave, blind
MR. FAwcETT did end by moving that Turkish promises of reform be
useless without guarantees, and that the misrule of the Turk will
continue till these guarantees be gotten.
And indeed I do, myself well believe it is so; and would have
voted for FAwcETT, had I been in the House, and would have had
the House vote with him. Only the Government do carry it with
a high hand, as having a clear majority of voices, and therein man
more lovers of the Turk than of the Christians under his rule, and
did now see why they had stopped SIR CHARLEs DILKE's mouth with
a Select Committee, and so put off a division, that they might now
force FAwcETT to one, as knowing he would be well beaten. Which
my LoRD HARTINGTON perceiving, said that he would not vote on
such a division, though he did subscribe to MR. FAwcETT's speech
and motion, only would not have it put now, since it said but
what the Government, stood to, so far as words go, which is,
indeed, as far as they stand to anything.
And MR. GLADSTONE did speak mighty well and to the same tune
as MR. FAwcETT, only sharper and stronger and brisker and fiercer
all at once, as is his wont: that it did stir me sometimes like the
sound of a trumpet. And did say well that the question he would
have answered was, how long the words of Europe should continue
mere words? A question which, methinks, all should wish to have
answered, that see what is f". on under the Turk. And did
clearly show how the Turkish Christians do lie under our guard
since our last war against the Muscovite.
And, after, one BUTLER JOHNSTONE did speak up for the Turk, so
stoutly that I wondered. And did prophesy how, perhaps, a few
ears hence, England and Turkey would be the only countries in
urope that would have Law and not Force to govern them. Which
I did admire, for the boldest thing, I think, I did ever hear said by
a.man in his sound mind. -
And after him one RYLANDs, a rough, rasping, northern man, that
I do not love to hear, spoke his mind of SIR Y ELLIOT, and so
did draw rebuke from a smooth young spark, one SIR HENRY Wolff,
but one that methinks do look and speak more like a lamb, only very
hot for the Turk, and against MR. GLADSTONE, as one who hath held
two minds and two tongues in this Eastern matter. , And at last MR.
CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER to his legs, and was for drivin
FAwcETT to division, after much and loud crowing over him, an
those that went with him, that they durst not face an issue in the
House; after whom one Šid move the adjournment of the House
and thereon a º fight betwixt those that were for dividing and
those that were for a jºin , till the House as like the bear garden
on Bankside as ever I see... I oft-times locked out in the lobby, by
reason of divisions, and falling asleep there was chid for it by
one of the constables, and so was fain to creep away with my ears
hanging at nigh on three in the morning, and the House not up then,
but still fighting.

loose ends of business against the Easter holidays.

put away from the º, school, because she bobbed nother curtsey
to his wife. Which, though it were a pitiful thing in that foolish par-

question of. And so said my LoRD SANDoN, and would have Mem-
bers come to the Offices to ask about such small matters; and so I
think they were best do. -
MR. ForsTER did ask a question of the persons it was proposed to
amnesty for part taken in the Bulgarian business, wherein, after
much writing of my LoRD DERBY, is, as usual, no satisfaction, only
no one to be heard of that hath yet been brought to account by the
Turk, except poor Christian Bulgarians, that do come by cuffs from
all, but most from the Zaptiehs, as they do call their constables,
and must see their women beaten and wronged, and cattle taken,
and houses burnt about their ears, and then pay their taxes twice
over, and afterwards, if they grumble, be clapped in prison. ..
For the which the Turk do talk of giving them an amnesty, which
do puzzle me.
hen the House to the Prisons Bill, which was stayed by two pes-
tilent Irish Members, between whom hard to say if one BIGGAR, or
one Powell, the more vexatious.
And at last, at one of the clock, BIGGAR did move to report pro-
gress, for that º on the Government Bench were asleep, which
indeed was so, and I marvel not.
*:::::::::::::: my Lords did break up to their Easter holi-
days; and, methinks, have well earned them, sitting as they will
do oft-times for half-an-hour at a stretch, and not in a crowded
house, and among merry company like the Commons, but few of
them in a great room, and mighty dull, for the most part; so that,
methinks, I do pity my LoRD BEAconsfield.
In the Commons, talk of new outrages by the Turk near Adrianople.
Then, a passage between, MR. GLADSTONE and SIR. D. Wolff,
touching, the letter that the one had written the other in a news-
paper, º for garbling words of MR. GLADSTONE's, to make
it seem he had held two ways about the Turk and his doings. And
SIR DRUMMOND Wolff do hold it inconvenient that Members should
be written to by Members, and between such would have only speech
in the House.
Long talk therºon, and MR; GLADSTONE did give good reason why,
to saye time of the House, it were well sometimes to write to a
Member in the newspaper rather than speak to him in the House
where is too much speaking already; and I am of his mind. An
he did justify what he had written º well, and did show that
he hath not kept two ways; whereat I am glad, for though he do
talk and write too much, and on too many matters, I do love to see
how stout and strong of heart MR. GLADsroNE is, and how ready to
speak up for all poor and oppressed persons and causes that be held
down, and most of all by the Turk.
Then further debate touching SIR HENRY ELLIOT, whom one
RYLANDS, that I love not, but herein do see he spoke true enough,
did charge as a friend of the Turk, and one through whom was
little hope of any countenance being kept by us against the Turk's
misdeeds, or of any bold calling of him to answer. And for all that
MR. BURKE and MR. Coch RANE did maintain, I do think it is as
RYLANDs do say, and that SIR HENRY ELLIot must needs be more
like to stroke down the Turk, than to rub him against the hair,
seeing that has been his way for all the years he has been about the
Grand Turk's Court. And so said GLApstone; and I see not how it
can be otherwise. Only none do say other than that SIR HENRY is a
mighty honest gentleman, and means well.
ut we know the place that well-meanings do go to the paving
of, and I do think, Turkey just now is, after that place, the bravest
in the world for such paving, and SIR HENRY ELIIoT do seem well
content therewith. But for walking on, I have always heard that
the paving in Constantinople is the worst that a man need wish. And
so, methinks, it will be, till some other than the Turk takes it in

A WONDERFUL WHISKEY.
A REMARKABLY good thing in Whiskeys is offered by advertise-
ment to the British Public, including, apparently, by implication the
United, Kingdom Alliance. We are informed that “it is recom-
mended by the Medical Profession throughout the Kingdom as the
ure and safe alcoholic stimulant.” Also, that it “is thoroughly
ee from fusel oil, and every gallon guaranteed is equally pure.”
(The purchaser, then, had best see that, his gallon is guaranteed
or that his smaller quantity has been derived from a guaranteed
gallon.) A medical contemporary pronounces it “wholesome and
leasant.” A second medical journal describes it as “a safe stimu-
ant.” A third avers that it is “very wholesome,” and “may be
safely used.” A fourth declares it to be “invaluable as an alcoholic
stimulant.” A fifth calls it “the purest of alcoholic, stimulants.”
A sixth terms, it “an excellent dietetic stimulant.” A seventh
styles it “a safe stimulant.” An eighth goes so far as to affirm that
“all who value health should use it.” #. several physicians
it is characterised as the “purest whiskey I ever examined,” “free
from all injurious substance,” “wholly free from all impurities,”
and “very wholesome and of fine quality.”. If these encomiums are
merited, what a very different spirit the whiskey which has ed
them must be from every other! Unless indeed, it is really true
that MyNHEER WAN DUNk was, as is related of him in the Tempe-
rance Glee, accustomed to preserve uniform sobriety, on brandy-
and-water, in the proportions of “two quarts of the first to a pint
of the latter daily.” In that case there may be ed some
comparison between the whiskey recommended by the Faculty as
above, and WAN DUNK's brandy. Certainly a spirit so salubrious as
that whiskey is made out, might well challenge the denomination of
aqua vitae, or eau de vie. - -
*. best of this eximious whiskey is, that nobody can ever, get
drunk on it. This is what must commend it to the patronage of all
the Temperance Societies. No Teetotaller can object to a whiskey
which, though an alcoholic, is not an intoxicating liquor. -
A whiskey with which, you may brew the draught that cheers
but not inebriates as well as you can with Kaisow or any other
Chinese grocery, is well and neatly denominated “Encore Whiskey.”
By “encore,” of course is meant capable of repetition, the same
indefinite repetition as gingerbeer, soda-water, lemonade, sherbet,
or any other beverage obtainable at a Temperance Tavern; if not
repetition to the extent of absolutely unlimited goes. Your pitcher,
or Cruiskeen Lawn, of this loyely spirit, may go ever so often to
the well of the Encore water of life, not only without being broken
at last, but without as much as finding its way “down among the
dead men” under the table I -

STEAM ON TRAINWAYS.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
Such a friend of the Arts and Sciences as yourself will, I
am sure, benleased to hear how a locomotive driver should proceed
when he takes his train round a curve. * - -
Speaking of the late accident to the “Flying Scotchman,” the
Daily Telegraph says:— * * * si - - - - -
“There are two methods of running over a curve. Should the driver de-
cide to use the first of these, he gets up a good pace and then, the moment the
curve commences, shuts off his steam, opens his regulator, and so runs round
the dangerous, corner with a long, steady, easily-going stroke. Another
method is, as the curve approaches to shorten the stroke of the piston, clap
on full speed, and pass the turning by trusting more or less to the category of
chances.
It is sºmewhat new for a driver to “shutºff his steam and ºpen
his regulator,” and so obtain “a long, steady ºily-gºing stroke.”
from his engine; but “to shorten the stroke of the piston”! ".
STEPHENson was sorry for the “coo,” which # come into
collision with his locomotive machinery. What would he say about
the ass whº has run thus dead in its face in the D. T. f
Should the Daily Telegraph ever publish an article on the collid-
ing of two trains, I expect we shall be told how the two engines
reared themselves high on their hind wheels, and amidst a Wesuvius
of steam and red-hot cinders, struggled for the “back throw,”
whilst their respective trains awaited motionless the impending
“telescoping.”
I am, Mr. Punch, yours faithfully, -

BILL BUNKIT AND THE MASTER-AT-ARMS.
(A real Voice from the Engine-room.)
BILL BUNKIT was a stoker, in a British man-o’-war;
He could “slice up” with a poker, or shift a down-dropt bar;"
He was like a salamander, when before a fire he stood, ..
And no tougher British bull-dog e'er breathed battle in his blood.
He could make a piece of gasket," he could knot, plait, splice, and
int;
He could clean a fire, or feed one, or make or break a joint;
He was light and merry-hearted, and obedient to command;
Knew everything an A.B. should—to reef, and steer, and hand.
On deck he was no duffer, for the downhaul" he did tend;
He was best oar in the cutter ; good at bowline or at bºnd ;
A Turk's-head or a Tom-Fool's knot, to him was simply fun;
The yard-arm was his station aloft; on deck, bow-gun."
But, as nothing lasts beneath the sun, at length there came a change,
And BILL BUNKIT he began to growl at all within his range;
After fifteen years of service, his º it gave way,
And he swore he'd no more shift his rig' a dozen times a day.
“Now look 'ee here, our side,” he said, as once off deck he came,
Perspiring †† his jumper, and his forehead in a flame;
“If this sail-drill rot was any use, I wouldn't care a cuss;
But we know as it ain’t, and so do they, to make things wuss.
“Nine times to-day we've left our work, and had to shift our rig–
The first to cross to gallant yards, the next to hoist the gig;
And now that the darned scurry they call “smartness,” may amuse,
We're run to death, to drill at sails as the ship 'll never use.
“For fifteen year I’ve weathered" the defaulters' book and list, , .
But I don't no longer care a d-” (here he came down with his
fist).
“They’ll neither let us stay on deck, nor let us stay below,
And wº. the ship's work’s all adrift, we're bound to help the
snow.
“I only hope John BULL may not be sold another ‘pup,'
By being º over, and his eyes with sails bunged up;
To find at last, and to his cost, things mayn't be what they seem—
For tº: our sails may show sky-high, our sailing's done by
steam.
“We know the ship can't budge an inch with Engineers that's slack;
And some folks would be delighted to catch us ‘flat aback,'
Which there's not a doubt within my mind they very quickly may,
When the British Fleet depends upon no better men than they.”
Then ºme John Dyk, and he sez, “Did you mean that?”—“I
Sez Bini." Quoth JoBNDY, “Recollect, I've heard you term a ‘kid."
Your former second in command. Pray, Sir, how dare you laugh?’
“Excuseme, Sir,” said BILL, “the word warn’t kid—butsucking calf.”
“Explain yourself,” he growled, “or, as you know I am a nipper,
I'll Pº. yº; straight at seven bºils, and bouse" you 'fore the
Skloder.
“Well, Sir,” said BILL, “from this one fact the state of things
you’ll gather—
The Junior Engineer, why he might 'a been his father.”"
Then Master-at-Arms he lays his hand on BILL, and sez, sez he,
...The more that's true, the less it ought to pass 'twixt you and me.
But blest if what you says is news. ere’s them as ships commands
As knows no more of engines than waisters or green-hands.
“We trust *m till anchor’s dropped, from the time as anchor's
weigned :
And the less the sails is looked to, the more fuss about 'em's made.
Blest if I see how skippers, now-a-days, their work’s to do,
Unless, besides their seamanship, they studies stokin' too!
...There was a time, as I've heard tell, when Navy Captains bold
Warn’t no-ways swells like them as now sports Navy §. and gold.

And, in language, wasn't over nice ashore or 'board o' ship.

SIR,--I have long been under the impression that I was born to
supply a want., True, that having been born, I do supply a great
many wants—chiefly my own. But that is not what I was going to say
—this is, and here follows my meaning. Sir, the fire of National Poetry
is defunct-apparently, at least, it is out. Not so. It sleeps within
this breast. coal is still warm; let me but apply the bellows of
the Divine afflatus, and once more the flame will blaze forth, and the
sacred altars will be all aglow with the brightness of the True
British Ballad.
..Whence came this afflatus! “If you ask me, I will tell you.”. I
dipp'd into, DIBDIN, but 'twas not there; and, indeed, since the
days, the glorious º when the Ballads of the Baiº. appeared
in your pages, Sir, the harp that once delighted the caboose and
cheered the Hearts-of-Oak on a Saturday night at sea, has been
unstrung, has been down a peg or two, and then up a peg or two,
on the wall of my cottage by the sea. Well, your honour, I was
roaming in maiden meditation, fancy free, down a street not a
hundred miles from the Strand, when I saw a shop-window full of
the good old Catnach Ballads!. Four thousand of all sorts, shapes
and sizes, with such illustrations! Sir, the price of these art-
treasures was, need I say it, untold gºld. o turn to my dear
friend (who shall be nameless, or else he'd be bored to death with
applications from-Well, no matter from whom ; but I don't pro-
se, to kill the prolific goose until it's all or a with him), I say,
ir, to turn to my dear friend, and to borrow the sum requisite for
the º: of these Ballads, was but the work of a moment; in
another, I was in the shop, addressing my purveyor of poems, and
buying them by the metre-I mean, Sir, literally, by the yard.
ir, I am going to favour the company with a few songs on this
model. But I must first offer you a sample of the original, in order
that the public, which has long been a stranger to true poetry, may
see that the §. of poetry is not strained through cullenders;
that it is not bound, by any rules of rhyme, reason, or metre, but
that, like Genius, it is unfettered, and, like Pegasus, it makes
small account of its feet, seeing that it possesses wings, for flights of
fancy. , The specimen I will give you is from a soul-stirring ballad,
entitled The Gallant Poacher, which commences with an invita-
tion to “All you lads of high renown,
# love to drink #. ale º 's brown,
hat pull the lofty Pheasant down
With powder, shot, and gun,”—

Poaching public, the life and death of his gallant hero.
here are six verses. I give you the last, as being my model in
future, and as being a specimen of real unfettered genius in the
plenitude of its magnificent liberty:—
“The murderous hand that did him kill,
And on the ground his blood did spill,
Must wander sore against his will,
And find no resting place;
Destructive things,
His conscience stings,
He must wander thro' the world,
And ever feel the smarring thorn,
But pointed at with finger of scorn,
ondemned for to die.”

glorious Bard, who, with one dash of the hand could sum up the
tortures of the Inferno in these two brief lines—
“Destructive things
His conscience stings.”
The use of the singular verb after, the plural nominative is as
forcible as it is remarkable. Again, is not
“Smarring thorn”
more than Shakspearian? To my great mind, which is gradually
under this tutorship emancipating itself from the trammels of
grammar-a difficult'phrase to pronounce often, without calling it
the “grammels of trammar,”—I say to º flº mind (I am having
my waistcoats considerably increased to hold it), this ballad is the

THE BOAT-RACE OF THE FUTURE. -
(A Prophecy which Mr. Punch most earnestly trusts will not be verified.)
IT was the day of the Boat-Race. A bright, clear morning, with a glorious
sun, reflected a thousand times in the jing water! Great was the contra
between the weather and the crowd. The first was suggestiye of everything
that was fresh and innocent; the last recalled visions of Homburg, Baden-
Baden and Spain the bad old days of the cards, and spinning balls, and fº.
baized tables. Unhappily, all the rascality of the stable ha found its way t
the banks of the river. The public were raving with excitement. Men, women,
and children no longer cared for the pleasures of lunch, the charms of conversa-
tion, the amusement of the race itself. All hearts beat but to learn the answer
to one absorbing question, had their bets been won or lost P
Yes, it had come to this! The grand old University Boat-Race had been
degraded by the love of play to the level of the lowest of sporting events. In
1877 (many years before) great complaints had been made about the matter. It
had been said, then, that unless the conditions of the contest were altered,
things would change from worse to worse; and that, corrupted by the pollution
of London sporting roughs, sporting publics, and spºrting papers, the pleasanter
features of the festival would give place to more and more hateful ones. It had
been then ºff. that the Race should be rowed at Henley or Bedford, or
even distant'Exeter. Nothing, however, had been done; and here more than
ten years later, was the Boat-Race still on Thames waters, fouling and befouled.
And had the prophets of ill-omen been borne out? Alas! a glance at the faces
and forms around was enough to answer the question. When men forget to
smoke, or eat, or flirt; when women care not whether or no they look their
best, then, indeed must both be lost to eyerything save the passion of play.
And now the men were silent, cigarless, and distrait; the women were reckless
in wearing the most unbecoming colours, the most ill-fitting gloves, the dullest
and dowdiest toilettes.
It was but a few minutes before the start, when a shambling creature,
who looked like something between a stable-help and a decayed churchwarden
made his .*. through the shouting throng to the part of the Grand stand
reserved for the University Officers, Heads of Colleges, and other Dons of the
most dignified orders. For many minutes he vainly
attempted to attract the attention of a venerable Dean,
who, betting-book in hand, was loudly offering the odds
to two white-chokered Heads, a Proctor, and a Poker;
for, sad to say, the betting fever had spreadfrom Under-
raduates' wine-parties to Fellows' Common Rooms.
he shambling creature at last succeeded in attracting
the attention of the yenerable Dean, who hobbled towards
im as rapidly as his advanced . would permit.
“What do you want?” he asked, breathlessly. “Un-
less it is something very important, I must not be
disturbed. I have not nearly done all my hedging.”
“You were very good to me once, Sir,” replied the
Tout, “when you got me leave to stay up, after the
Master had ordered me down. You would scarcely
believe, looking at my present degraded position, that
I was once a Member of the dear old College.”
“Indeed!, indeed!” ºried the Dean, impatiently. “I
do not doubt your word for a moment. d if I was
kind to you in the past, pray think no more about it.
But I really must return, or Ishall have nº time to get
my money well on. My book is a very heavy one;”
and he sighed º - -
“I have come to show my gratitude,” continued the
Tout, detaining the Dean by the button-hole. Then he
whispered, “Take my tip, and put the pot heavily on
Camford.” - -
The Dean started, as in an undertone he replied, “But
all the Sporting Papers declare that Oxbridge must win;
and certainly I can sº testify to the superiority in
strength, and excelſence of style in their trials.”
“Put the pot on the other side of the fire for all that,”
hissed the Tout. “They’ve been made safe, I tell you.”
... “But each man has had two doctors and a policeman
in close attendance upon him ever since he came to
Putney, and the boat has been kept under lock and key
in Sºland Yard.” -
The Tout closed his left eye, “Bobbies and boys
have been hocussed, horses and boats have been got at,
hº now. put the pot heavily on Camford, I say
again!
“I will!” mentally ejaculated the Dean, as he rushed
back as quickly as #. great age would permit to the
box on the Grand Stand reserved for the Heads of
Colleges. He had scarcely been in his place ten minutes
when the flashing oars of the two boats were seen coming
round the bend into the last reach, amid a murmur
that, as they * rose into a roar.
Oxbridge had been ièading from the first. At Ham-
mersmith she had two clear lengths in hand, and these
two lengths had been increased by Mortlake to six. It
was a dead certainty: the Dean, beside himself with
excitement, in broken ejaculations from the Commination
service, cursed the Tout who had put him in the hole.
Suddenly there was a mighty shout—the Oxbridge
stroke let go his oar, threw up his arms, and fainted.
There was another shout, and another and yet another,
as Numbers. Seven, Six, and Five followed their leader.
At length the crew without exception lay doubled over
their thwarts. Taking advantage of this strange con-
tretemps the rival boat shot ahead, and passed the post
an easy winner. -
Again a mighty shout, which seemed to shakeMortlake,
Putney, and the neighbourhood to their very foundations,
told an expectant world that Oxbridge had been hocussed
for the third time, and that Camford had scored one more
victory. -
And, as that shout arose, the venerable Dean might
have been seen dancing all over the stand as well as
his age and some remains of a sense of his clerical
character would permit; for he had followed the grateful
Tout's advice, and had put the pot heavily on the
Winners.
As for the cleaned-out Heads, Proctors, and Poke
they were cursing—also under the thin professio
º: of the Commination service,—and telegraphing to
their various Bankers.
On them, and still more on the young men and women
of the hideous scene, let us draw the qrtain.

MY RIDE TO KHIWA.
BY OUR OWN REPRESENTATIVE RIDER.
"." He informs the Editor of his preparations. The Editor begs to
inform the Public that he (the Ed.) is not responsible for the
scheme, and withholds his assent for the present.
. SIR-In a brief letter, two weeks since, I announced to you my
intention of riding to Khiva, I knew that there was a large body
among the public that would willingly pay my expenses by subscrip.
tion to go away anywhere, and so why not to Khiva
Now, Sir, I am perfectly aware, that CAPTAIN FRED BURNAby has
made this ground, as it were, his own. And how P Because, for-
sºoth, having ridden to Khiva, he made such a confounded fuss
about it. A gallant exploit it was I admit, though I should be diffi-
dent in making the admission (however admission is free in this
instance), as I myself rode to Khiva years ago; thought nothing of it,
: said nothing about it. I took it in the day's work, and there an
end.
But now,the case is different...I must out-Bubnaby BURNABY.
Hº only rode to Khiva. I shall ride there and back. I shall keep you
infºrmed of my progress from time to time, either by special messenger
or by º wire, which, with my own patented apparatus, I
shall take with me in my side cket. It occupies no space to speak
of, and is paid-out like the Atlantic Cable. I am getting up a Com-
pany for it, and all shareholders, among whom I hope to number
most of the Crowned Heads of Europe, will be presented with a beau.

silver, Jasp). Beforestºrting for aride tº anywhere, whether Khiva
; ld derminster, one thing is absolutely necessary, i.e., something
rºde ºz.
Economy being the better part of valour, I have determined in
view of the subscription list not being quite so full as I might natu-
rally expect (it is not yet cºmpleted—and you haven't, I regret to
see, exhibited it in your window in Fleet Street—why this de ". ?),
not to purchase, but to hire. I forget the exact distance from here
to Khiva. But one can't hurt much at eighteenpence an hour (half-
a-crown for the first and eighteenpence for all the others—of course
Itake all the others and let some one else have the first), and a
reduction will be made on taking a quantity. -
I am off now to see about the horse. After that I must call in at
MAY's, the costumier's, about my dresses. The Courier of St.
Petersburg used to have at least six, one after the other, appearing
in the third as Mr. Pickwick (spelt Kjqkkjp in Russian, which is
spoken, as read, backwards, and takes some time to master), and
finally as Apollo, but this is for a different climate. -
I have got º saddlebags containing provisions, warming-pan (an
article absolutely indispensable in the gold climate to which I am
going), matches, saucepans, patent smokeless stoves, coals, and (by
the kind permission of MR. CHATTERTON), the red-hot poker out of
the last Christmas Pantomime.
A semi-grand piano, fitted up inside as a comfortable bed-room,
all complete, a store of American beef, a cellaret of beer, cham-
pagne (Pommery and Greno très see, beeause it keeps dry in all
climates), and a few other articles, the list of which would make
this article unnecessarily lengthy, complete my Christopher—I mean
my kit.

sufficiently good promise to that effect, be deposited with my banker
in writing, but not till then, I am off, till which happy moment,
believe me to remain here pluckily and dashingly as ever,

Punch notes with regret, was signed on Saturday, March 31, not on

he House then went into the Prisons Bill, and MR. CRoss had a
tussle with MR. PARNELL, who, more Hibernico, moved a clause,
classing treason-felons with first-class misdemeanants, who are
not felons at all:. MR. CRoss finally agreed to the clause, with the
Bull º: that persons convicted of sedition and seditious
libel should be treated as misdemeanants of the first-class, which
fººtainly are, being, as a rule, of the class that ought to know

The moral of AEsop's well-known fable is that the trumpeters
deserve heavier punishment than the rank and file. They will,
under this clause, get better treatment. It is quite right for those
who look on sedition and seditious libel as venial, if not laudable,
diversions, to make provision for the comfort of those who may
indulge in these amusements.
MR. E. W. SMITH made a clear, business-like, and well-digested
speech in introducing the Civil Service Estimates to a thin House
-of a score in all. Does the House want such an explanation,
or does it not? After asking for it, Honourable Members might
surely pay MR. SMITH the compliment of coming to hear it. The
Honourable Member for the Book-stalls showed that, excluding the Off
cost of Army and º Collecting the Revenue, Education, and
Contributions to Local Taxation—rather important exclusions, it is
true—the cost of governing the country is less by £400,000 than it
was in 1857. This reminds Funch of an embarrassed but easy-
going friend of his, who was always proving that if you excluded
the cost of his wine-cellar and table, cigars, stables, gardens, tailors'
and milliners' bills, children's schooling, travelling, and amuse-
ments, he was really spending, at least, †. a year less
than he did ten years before, yet found himself every year getting
deeper and deeper into difficulties.
The House then went into Supply, in which SIR CHARLES DILKE
distinguished himself by moving to omit the cost of, feeding the
Deer in Richmond Park; MR. PARNELL, 'ºrº the Motion to
Report ºf: at half-past twelve, in the teeth of MR. BUTT,
because an Irish Bill was coming which he wanted more time for ob-
structing; MR. M'CARTHY Down ING, by pitching into MR. PARNELL
and MR. BIGGAR, by pitching into MR. M'CARTHY DownING; an
lastly CAPTAIN Noºn, by taking objection to MR; BENNET-STAN-
FoED's coughing at him. Altogether the Home-Rulers are showing
their Kilkenny cats' claws too soon—and in the wrong place. They

1. The House talked about Gas Bills and Water-works. May
Punch, some day, have to record that it has done something to give
us better light and purer water, and more of both. -
2. The House talked about Public Executioners, and Public Offices.
What Punch objects to is, that the one should be turned into the

3. The House talked about the Commercial Department of the
Foreign Office. Most people will be glad to know that there is, a
Commercial Department at the Foreign Office. We had thought
that the Foreign Office left such low matters as commerce to the
lower departments, such as the Board of Trade, and the East End

A VISION OF ACCLIMATISATION.
bwaRD WILson, in a paper read
some months ago at a meeting
of the Royal Colonial Institute,
treats acclimatisation, in its
more general aspect. MR.
WILson views the problem
somewhat enthusiastically, and
considers that the command
given to Noah, “Be fruitful
and multiply, and replenish
the earth, and subdue it; and
have dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over every living
ºf that moveth upon the
earth,’ conveys by implication
a direct order to take the work
of acclimatisation in hand. . . .
But it might, perhaps, be possi-
ble to acclimatise in England

yellow Australian parroquet

thought so... (He had forgotten when the Attendant had to appear.)
You are on in Act iii., Scene 1,–a most important situation. You
have to say—
Tymkyn (with a smile of ineffable scorn). One line, Sir; only one
line, and that (with inexpressible contempt) as a mere feeder for
Macbeth.
Mr. William Shakspeare (shifting his argument), But immedi-
ately afterwards you usher in the two Murderers—the most intense
scene in the º:
Tymkyn (with well assumed indifference). º so, Sir. Ihave
not seen it, as I am at once ordered off the stage by Macbeth, and
told to stay outside the door until he and the two Murderers call for
me...And—allow me to add, MR. SHAKspEARE,--I don't know
whether it were a noversight on your part or not, but (in a tone of
the deepest jº they never do call for me, (Stifles his emotion,
and resumes.) The consequence is, Sir, that I do not appear again.
Burbage (half aside, to SHAKSPEARE). You know...you do want a
good man in the Attendant's part. TYMKYN'll do it for you, if you
just give him a line or two more, and bring him on again with a line
or two. You know he can speak the lines if you give 'em to him.
Marry come up, WILL |
Mr. William Shakspeare (meditatively). I might make him a
Fourth Witch.
Burbage. Now, by my halidome, that shalt thou not! ...No more

ymkyn (overhearing and catching at the idea). Ay, by’r La'kin',
and give me a fight with Bango, or whatever his name is. I have
friends, Sir, in front, who expect somewhat from RALPH. TYMKYN—
and sturdy knaves, too, I warrant you, whose hands are as horny
: clapping, and their throats as potent for hissing, as their neigh-
urs’.
Mr. William Shakspeare (after considering the MS. attentively).
Tis well, MASTER TYMKyn ! Thou shalt have thy lines (colloquially),
I’ll bring §§ in, as MR. BURBAGE has suggested, as a Third
Murderer. I’ll give you some first-rate bits—short, but telling—
and we’ll arrange the business of the fight at rehearsal.
Tymkyn (determined not to lose his opportunity). I’m up to all
sorts of combats, and, if necessary, can go through two or three traps.
We’ve got one here that was used for the Grave-Diggerin Hamlet,

him.) You'll have your part with the new matter to-morrow.
[Looks towards WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE, who is already seated
at Prompter's table busily engaged in altering Sc. 1, Act it.,
so as to introduce the Attendant who is to ‘double’ the
part of the ‘Third Murderer.' SHAKSPEARE looks up for
a second, nods assent, then resumes his work.
Tymkyn (saluting MR, BURBAGE with much courtesy). Give ye
good den, MASTER BURBAGE. (To MR. WILLIAM! SHAKSPEARE.) And
you, too, MASTER SHAKSPEARE. Give you good den, Sir. Sola! sola!

The next day at rehearsal, MASTER RALPH. TYMKYN was pre-
sented with a part carefully written out in the largest and roundest
hand, extending over three pages, and containing several additional
lines for the Attendant, who thenceforth doubled the character of the
Third Murderer,
A SAILOR'S FRIEND.
THE subjoined paragraph of news may suggest a reminiscence to
some of the elder readers of Punch :—
“THE SEAMEN's Hospital SocIETY-The PRINCE of WALEs has sent
a subscription of £50 to the funds of the Seamen's Hospital Society (late
Dreadnought), Greenwich, through His Grace the Duke of NorthumEER-
LAND.”

A woodcut extant on one of Mr. Punch's preceding es is also
engraven on the memory of patriarchs, ey remember LEECH's
representation of the PRINCE of WALEs as a sailor-boy, on tiptoes,
presenting a British Tar with a glass of grog. That was a donation,
suitable to the years of His Royal Highness, in testimonial of his
kindly consideration of poor Jack. Another as suitable to his pre-
sent age and position, is this contribution to the funds of the
Seºmen's Hospital Society, which greatly needed it, and which are
still o to liberal donations from disposed to emulate a
princely example.

English Shepherd discovered writing with extreme rapidity. To
him enter Foreign Shepherd, leisurely.
Foreign. Shepherd. Good day, busy Shepherd' You see I have
come to join you for awhile, in hopes, under your kindly guidance,
here to steep my soul in the refreshing balm of pastoral retirement.
Bnglish Shepherd (hurriedly). Glad to see you! but really I am so
very busy. . Should prefer answering inquiries by post-card.
Foreign Shepherd. Much-troubled. Shepherd, you surprise me. I
had imagined Arcadia the land of leisure.
English Shepherd. Ah! a vulgar error, I assure you. But as you
are a stranger, I will try to spare you five minutes. Now then, what
can I do for you? Is there anything you want information about—
guidance—encouragement—give it a name?
Foreign Shepherd. Allow me first to give you my own—BIS-
MARCK.
English Shepherd (politely). Prince! A thousand pardons! I
had not recognised your Highness. I need scarcely say that I shall
be only too delighted to give you any information you º require
about this new scene—this land not of lotos-eating, but of laborious
leisure, where it is never—rather than always—afternoon; at least,
never after post-time.
Foreign Shepherd. Thanks! First, then, as Hamlet says, can you
play on this }; and teach me to do the same P
English Shepherd. Theoretically I can do both, but perhaps you
had better wait till my essay on the subject-written for the
Twentieth Century, the Magazine of the Future—is published. . In
it. I have gone into the matter of piping, and the varieties of syrinz,
tibia, and awabs, with their different musical modes, rather deeply.
I think you will find my authorities tolerably complete, and my
deductions from them satisfactory.
Foreign Shepherd. I doubt it not, Shepherd. Next, can you put
me up to anything in the breeding and care of sheep, and the shear-
ing, and fattening, killing, and cooking them P -
English Shepherd. I have touched upon all these matters inci-
dentally in an excursus I am writing upon “the Pastoral Life and
its º. to be printed in the appendix of my treatise on
“The Moon, and how to get there, with stray thoughts upon
Balloons and the Electric º
Foreign Shepherd. May I ask how you manage §. own flock?
English Shepherd. Nay—my days of practical Shepherd-life are
over. I am so busy with other matters, that I have pretty well lost
sight of my late sheep. - -
Foreign. Shepherd. Busy" Not with that most wearisome of
all work—politics—I hope
English Shepherd. I came here, like yourself, to avoid it. If I
write a score of political pamphlets in a year, or deliver as man
political speeches in a month, it is quite as much, in that line, as
can find time for. No. I have turned over my crook to my excellent
young friend, HARTINGTON. A few hints a day about the leader-
ship of the party is the limit of my interference. You see he must
learn to walk alone. In fact I am too old for political work. I
am here to enjoy ease with dignity, and a due allowance of letter-
writing.
Foreign Shepherd. My case to a nicety,

English Shepherd. Well, no, not exactly, You see I am rather
fond of wood-gutting, and should have made short work, ere this,
with most of the timber in Arcadia, had not the native Shepherds,
with less taste for strenuous occupation, violently interfered...
Foreign Shepherd. Dear me! I had thought that the inhabitants
of this charming country were the peacefullest of people. .
English Shepherd. Well the fact is,...we don't quite suit each
other. They actually got up an indignation meeting the other day
to protest against what they call my “restlessness.” I made
except the letter-writing.

I hope to get back to my axe again.
Foreign Shepherd. Do the Arcadians ever dance?
English Shepherd. They did. The first day. I joined them they
wanted me to step a measure. In answer to their invitation, I de-
livered a lecture, in two parts, upon dancing from the earliest days,
illustrated with extracts from the Classical Authors. The delivery
of that took me only a summer's day, but the Arcadians are a super-

On the first of February, say the Almanacks, “Partridge-shooting
ends.” Does it? Perhaps it does, and perhaps partridge-netting
begins. What say the poulterers ?
Everybody knows that the birds above enumerated ought all at
this time to be hatching their eggs, or foragi§ for their young, and
not hanging up for sale. Also, that to eat birds at breeding-time is
the way to exterminate them and destroy food, Pººl. always bad
enough, is, during the close months, too bad. It wo & have been
scorned by the genuine old poacher, the burden of whose song was:—
“'Tis my delight, of a shiny night,
In the season of the year.”
But your poulterers' poachers poach without limitation by the
season. They poach, as zealous pastors preach, in season and out of
season.
The pºulterers will perhaps say that their poachers poach out of
British bounds. In that case it may be worth while to consider
LoRD Colville's question in the Times:–
“If no other method can be devised for stopping this illegitimate traffic,
would it not be desirable that a Bill should be passed through Parliament
.# prohibiting the sale of any game, protected by British Game Laws,
after the expiration of the time during º such game may be killed ”
In a quaint volume, composed in pre-scientific days, an old
English writer, to account for the simultaneous appearance of birds
of passage all over England, gravely broached the speculation that
they descended from the moon. If poulterers could prove that their
shops were supplied from our satellite, then indeed, perhaps, they
might plead some justification for selling game and wildfowl out of

“I say, Guv'NER—YER AIN'T serN A Cove with My Second MokE, AR YER }''
OUR GLORIOUS RESTORATION.
DEAR PUNCH, .
OUR Parish Church has recently had the benefit of restora-
tion, under the stimulus of the zeal of our High young Vicar, and a
party he has got to back him. This operation has been effected by
the combined forces of a subscription, a restorative architect, a
solemn clerk of the works, a gang of very beery workmen, and large
libations of the necessary liquor, to keep their clay in the state ºf
moisture required for working.
Great glory has been achieved by the powers that be—the Vicar,
the Restoration Committee, the resident ecclesiologist, and others.
The old pews having been torn down, the memorial stones, thrust
into holes and corners, many cartloads of consecrated earth, with
a due proportion of humanity among the mould, used for filling up
an old sawpit, the long series of triumphs has culminated in an auction,
a sort of rag-and-bone sale of the disjecta membra of our Parish
Church, now effectually, turned out of windows. Imagine, dear
Punch, the i. of an unecclesiological parishioner, like
myself, on reading the placard—
“To be Sold, &c., &c., Carved Oak Pulpit—handsome Stone Font, date
unknown—curious oak panelling, time of QUEEN ELIZABETH-all in con-
sequence of the restoration of the Church.”
Brisk firewood prices, were realised, and marine-store-dealers
seemed to be having what their American cousins call “a good
time.” Some of the decorators, probably members of Archaeological
Societies, were heard to deplore the loss that had been sustained
through much of the old wood having been appropriated surrep-
titiously..by the workmen for their own fires. ..
I take the liberty of offering some suggestions to those who are
about to have the same operation performed in their own parishes.
For instance, the expenses of the Auctioneer might be saved by the
Sexton being employed on Sundays to dispose of the various proper-
ties by retail, at the church doors, after service—when once service
is set *:::::: º The chance of purchasing a lot of nice firewood
cheap would often be appreciated by the congregation.
Then why should an expensive gang of workmen be called in
merely to destroy P Could not the Wicar, Clerk, and Sexton, in the
words of MAGAULAY, “gird up their gowns, seize hatchet, bar
and crow, and aid in the work of demolition”? The National
School children, too, would be edified by the spectacle and delighted,
I am sure, to take part in it. ... We are at the present time teaching
them, b books only, a great deal about the Goths and Wandals; we
might thus give them an illustration by example of those barbarians
in action. sides it is such a great thing to ..º. all thein:
congruities of the last three hundred years—above all toget rid of all
traces of what our High young Vicar is in the habit of inveighing
against by the name of that “pernicious Protestantism,” and to
bring the Parish, Church back to the beauty of what he calls
“primitive times.”

THESE are hardly the days in which to establish a fresh class ºf

Cruelty Bill, which, contemplates protecting vertebrated animals
only, and so opens adoor for future agitation for removal of the Dis-

peal to the “proud title” of “our common vertebration” as a
ground for the courtesy of Counsel; but we doubt whether, there is
after all much to choose between the sensations of the live-bait, and
those of the cold-blooded vertebrate who has swallowed it.

We are sorry to add that OTTIwell, OTTECRossE BUNNE has since
given notice of a change of name. What a pity, as one of Punch's

Surely, my dear Mr. Punch, this thing is an allegory—a warning
against the use of the nasty filthy pipe º married men, lest in

SWIMMING IN THE CITY.
IT may not be f. known that among the Institutions of the
City of London there exists a special Society for the cultivation of
the manly art of swimming. This is the London Swimming Club,
quartered at the City of London Baths, Barbican, E.C. On the part
of this Association, the Secretary, MR. J. WHALLEY, announces their
offer “to instruct gratuitously all, non-swimmers, or to recommend
ſºnal instructors to those who can afford to pay for tuition,”
anol also-
“To assist the large wholesale houses of the City in forming swimming
clubs among their employés, having been exceedingly successful in similar
efforts in the East and West India Dock Company, where all candidates for
employment must either swim or undertake to learn in a stated time.”
. There is an obvious i. of usefulness for a Swimming Club
in any Company, employing persons about a Dock, who may
tumble into it. Their assistance must also be serviceable to shops
and City employés, who often get into hot water, but not so often
as they might to their own advantage, into cold. The principals o
some of those houses, besides, would be glad to learn how, under
any circumstances, to keep their heads above water.

PRIVATE and Confidential.—Look here, Mr. P. . It really is not fair to
pretend that your Reporter was overcome by the hospitality he experienced. I
assure you it was the emotion; and if I did turn into Primrose Hill Station-
House, it was simply because I mistook it for MR. FILDEs' studio, where I
understood he was painting a #.” to his great work “The Casuals,” the
title of which is to be “The Rear of the Van,” an expressive and realistic
view of the unfortunate convicts, as they are handed from the Police Omnibus
to the cells. If I might suggest to the Artist, a better title would perhaps be
“The Cells and the Sold.”). But this by the way. To say that I was there in
either a prostrate or a ridiculous position is to stab me with a Primrose; and as
to WILLs giving me Bird's Eye, I was not in his studio at all last round; and
when I was there I was introduced to Miss CAvexDIsh, who, no doubt, was
ordering her portrait or a leash of dramas (a reduction, don't you see, on taking
a quantity); and though her brilliant optic may have reminded me quite as
much of Bird's-Eye as of Cavendish, I know my manners better than to smoke
before a lady. All this, as I have intimated above, is strictly private; and I
shall take it as a personal affront if you further abuse my confidence and my
conduct in your next number. Of course, if you didn't mean it, I apologise.
Your Reporter grieves to write “Round Last,” but eircumstances over which
he has not sufficient control will get the better of him. The fact is, I have had
a facer from cruel Fate that has knocked me into what is figuratively known as
“a cocked hat.”
I received a card-several cards—elegantly printed, embossed, and gilt-
ed, from most of the Academicianº, all the Associates, and crowds of the
unappreciated outsiders, begging me." to honour them with a visit,” in fact
to accept their kind invitations to criticise their works with impartiality and
enthusiasm, only—and there is much virtue in your “only”—I was expected to
call on Sunday, the First of April 1 Now your Reporter has no conscience-
troubled vacillations as to the right and wrong of visiting a studio on a Sunday
afternoon. There are no cornfields for him to walk through at that time of
year, and it is too chilly to be abroad in the meadows to view the young lambs—
indeed I don't think it is good for the young lambs themselves. They run the
risk of cold, and though cold lamb, with mint-sauce, is not
to be sneezed at, lamb, with a cold, and sneezing, is not
pleasant. So as your critic can't pace the fields to study
the works of Nature, he does the other thing, sauntering
lazily from one work of Art to another, with much men-
tal profit and aesthetic advantage at the same time. But
your Reporter is not an ordinary bird, to be caught with
chaff or salt. - -
Private views, on the First of April! No, you don't!
Two can play at that old game! And yet—would you
believe it?—it was all bond fide. Show—Sunday fell on
the First this year, and the only—well, I will not say the
only fool, for I was misled by the cards of invitation, and
when I went round the studios on Tuesday (it was no use
going on Easter Monday, you know, for I am told all the
Artists go out of town on that anniversary to spend the
proverbial and much-advertised happy day at Rosher-
ville, or the best substitute for it they can find at
Brighton or Woolwich Gardens), all the doors were shut
in my face with a grin of the shutters, and the informa-
tion that I knewyery well all the pictures had “gone in.”
What a loss this is to the critical and artistic public,
my dear Sir, I need hardly point out. Had not this most
unhappy contretemps interrupted the course of these
“rounds,” I might have described MR. FRITH's tre-
mendous effort, which he has entitled “The Crush—a
Drawing-room at St. James’s.” I might have told how
on this crowded canvas the Aristocratic Countess, the
Distracted Dowager, and the Delicate Débutante are
seen tearing each other's lace flounces, brocade trains,
and damassés fixings, in the desperate charge of the six
hundred into the presence of Royalty:
I might have visited the studio of that Academician
of delicate feelings who puts a fan up when you men-
tion ETTY, and makes studies of the muscular system
from the stuffed lay-figure—to whom the naked eye is an
indelicacy, and the bare walls of his own room a painful
impropriety. I would, probably, but for that unlucky
First, have written a sonnet on MR. SANDYs's grand
drawing of “Medusa Defying the Consequences,” or his
poem in black chalk of “Penelope Chewing her Back
Hair,” though my lines could never come up to the
Artist's in Fº and grace of outline.
I would have told you how MossIEUR Tissot (who has
become so English that he prefers being called SIRTIssor,
Esquire) received me in his salon-conservatory, and
brought out for my decisive eye his charming study called
“The Female Four-Oar,”—four bewitching ballet-girls,
in sailor costume, rowing with the Artist as coxswain
down at Henley. I could have given you valuable infor-
mation about his allegorical picture, “Beauty as a Beast.”
“Mon, cher,” (he always speaks French to me,) “the
British Public wants more Poetry, more Sentiment, Eh
bien, I will give it them, mon ami,_tout chaud.”
You should have heard how I called on BoughTox,
and saw his “Primrose Family looking for themselves
in a Wood; ” how I revelled in a canvas of ORCHARD-
sox's, fifteen feet, long by two in height, called “Bill
Stickers Beware '''-a single murdered page lying in
the right corner with a dagger in his bosom, while the
top f a middle-aged head-dress, just seen above the
broken bottles, suggests a female interest in the unfortu-
nate victim, or how I tookP. in PETTIE's Rapier and
Dagger Fight, all point and edge, snip and snap, slish
and slash, like Petruchio's wife's gown.
I could have mentioned StoREY’s “Pumps at Bath,”
BRITTON RIvrièRE's “One Little Pig had none,” HAY-
wooD HARDY’s “ Štampede at the Zoo,” FRANK Holl's
“Undertaker's Delight,” WANDYKE BRowN’s “Definitire
and Decisive Burial of Harold's Body,” and Rose
MADDER’s “Cauliflowers and Melted Butter.” But as
these pictures, like the Critic's Armada, were not in
sight, F. not see them, and so am reluctantly obliged
to be silent. And, after ali, “silence is golden;" so pay
me for mine—a cheque will do—and do not, inº:
satirical way, insinuate that I was incapacitated by
numberless nips (Number Nip, by the way, is a malig-
nant fairy who might have tempted me into excesses),
from standing another Round.
No, Sir, this would be treatment worthy, of low and
scurrilous publications, not received on the drawing-
room tables of *:::: or the boudoir chiffoniers of
Carlton Gardens. Irepeat, Sir, my silence was due to
the fact that Show Sunday sº to fall on the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
VICTORY OVER VANDALS,
ERILY, Mr. Punch, for a long
time past, in daily perusing
your contemporaries, your ex-
clamation must have been
“Out on ye, owls! Nothing
but songs of dulness! No
news, ye newspapers, but the
most dreary, disheartening,
and dry? No relief to Parlia-
mentary prose and the pestilent
Eastern Question ?” Well,
Sir, here is some set-off to dis-
comfort, to common-place and
twaddle; to tales of atrocities,
outrages, and Vandalisms.
Here is exhilarating intelli-
gence. I quote the Times :-
“HAMPSTEAD AND HIGHGATE
RAILway.—MR. H. R. WILLIAMs
writes to us from Oak Lodge, High-
ate, N.:—“The Bill of the North
etropolitan High Level Railway
Company has just been withdrawn
by its promoters. Thus ends, after
more than one fruitless attempt to
launch it, a scheme which would
have benefited no one (except its
promoters), having no single
feature of public utility to recom-
with the absolute certainty of spoiling two of the finest suburbs
mend it, and
of London.’’
Hooray! These are glad tidings, Sir, to myself at least, as one
who has the heart that can feel for another. The defacement at the
hands of the North Metropolitan High, Level Railway Company,
happily averted from Hampstead and Highgate, is the like of that
which my Common has been threatened with º the London and
South-Western. I hope their project of encroachment will be de-
feated also by the effectual opposition of the Open Space Defenders
in Parliament to the Railway interest with their policy of steam
and iron. But to insure my delivery from the hands of those Philis-
tines who are doing their utmost to despoil me by adding inroad to
Railroad, pray, Sir, exhort my Parliamentary friends and well-
wishers to use careful watch for the preservation of the pleasant
vicinage of your suburban BARNES.
P.S.–It is all very well to remove all impediments to progress,
but I dread the abolition of the toll on Hammersmith Bridge. One
consequence will be that my little quiet promontory, or peninsula,
will very soon be built all over, and I shall be surrounded and
suffocated with slums. Who will not be very much the less happy
for all this, and who any the happier but landlords and builders?
REVOLUTION AWERTED !
DEAR Mr. PUNCH,
My attention has been called to an article by the RIGHT
HoN. SIR HENRY SUMNER MAINE, K.S.I., &c., in the current number
of the Fortnightly Review (a periodical famºree to savi never read
before), in which he compares the feudal land-laws of England and
France, and shows, with convincing clearness, how the main cause
of the French Revolution—that which not only brought it about,
but made it the horrid thing we all shudder at-was the peculiar
hatred of the French peasant to the French seigneur.. And yet, as
SIR HENRY T. on to show, almost all the incidents of French
tenure existed in England as in France. In fact the French peasant
was but the English copyholder under another name. How then
was it, he pertinently asks, that here in England we, having the
same evils, escaped a like curse P Do not English hearts burn at
injustice and wrong P. Do not Englishmen nurse grievances, and
thirst for revenge? SIR HENRY is not the man to ask questions
and then run away from the answers. He tells us why it was.
No one of the incidents of feudal tenure was more oppressive and
f. than the liability of the tenant to do taskwork for his lord.
n seed-time and at harvest he had to give a day's work for nothing.
He was driven reluctantly to the field, whither he went with a sore
heart, and which he left at eventide with muttered curses and half-
formed resolves. So grew the “rooted wrong,” which it required
a Revolution to remove.
In this England of ours the same liability existed, but instead of
tears we had laughter—instead of curses, songs. How is this? There
was, so SIR HENRY tells us, a custom in England that though the
tenant was bound at certain seasons to give his lord a day's work, the
WOL. LºokiL.
Q
lord was bºund to give the tenant, at the close of every day so spent,
a DINNER!
There! How clear it all seems now! The mystery is solved. The
true way of averting revolution is henceforth made plain to the
meanest understanding. It lies round the dinner-table.
In course of time, when the lords grew economical, they found
that Hopge ate a great many more potatoes than he hoed, and they
therefore ceased to exact the labour and to give the dinner.
But the effect of the custom survived in the admirable propensity
of our race to dine together on every possible occasion. It is the
DINNER, which has saved us, as SIR HENRY shows, from horrors
unspeakable in the past. That it may long continue so to do in the
future, is the earnest prayer of Yours truly, -
BENJAMIN BoomERsound,
(Ea. Toast-Master, with the sentiment, “ May
our Public Dinners never grow less.”)

NEAR MENTONE.
ExPERIENCE OF AN EYE AND NOSE.
By an Englishman in Italy.
THE sheen of olive-leafage flickers o'er
The shaded valley depths, like guardian steel
To keep from sunshine's ravage the rich store
Of flowers that those cool treasuries conceal.
In restful masses stand the pines on high,
In the deep hush of the unclouded sky.
The wind from seaward blows: no fitful gust,
But one harmonious march of fragrant air,
Brisk with the sharpness of the salt sea-dust,
Sweet with spring flowers and piny odours rare:
That breathes, as with a loving hush, to still
The voice of maidens coming down the hill.
With laughing eyes beneath the kerchief's fold,
And smiling lips and queenly pose and gait,
They bear their lemon-baskets, filled with gold,
Like Grecian nymphs who on some goddess wait;
A living picture in each vivid face,
And balanced form of free and simple grace.
A hush of converse as they draw anigh,
A coyness in the lift of nimble feet,
A consciousness of my regard, a shy
Half smile of welcome as our glances meet,
Like #...?" sunshine over April grass,
And, Heavens'ſ the whiff of Garlie as they pass!
Opinions Differ.
“I think it is a matter for congratulation and rejoicing, in the circum-
stances, that I should have to state that there is a small surplus, no remission
of taration, and no intention on the part of the Government of imposing any
new tax.”—CHANCELLOR of THE Exch EQUER, Budget Speech.
PERHAPs the tax-payer may think otherwise. Perhaps he may
consider that it is hardly “a matter for congratulation and re-
joicing ” that there is “no remission of taxation.” Or are we all
(the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequER excepted) wrong? Is taxa-
tion a blessing in disguise, one which ought to make us grateful for
its imposition, thankful for its continuance, and discontented and
murmuring when it is remitted P
-
No Smoke without (Poetic) Fire.
HERE is one of the neatest things in poetical advertisement Punch
has come across for some time. It is from the Burnley Advertiser ;
“Gaily Young FERGuson “When he wants good Smoking Mix-
Purchases his Cigars And Snuff for his nose; [ture,
At BLAzER's shop, Gaily Young FERGuson
Where the best are. Purchases those.”
The air aimed at seems to be the once fashionable “Gailw the
Troubadour; ” but the advertiser may say of his metre, as Fusbos
says of his tobacco, “Short cut or long to me are all the same.”
A SPEAKER TO SOME PURPOSE,
THE favourite interlocutory ejaculation of AHMED VEFIK. PASHA,
Speaker of the Turkish Parliament, it seems, is “Süss.”. Now
“Sliss’ in German means “sweet.” In Turkish it means “Shut
up !”—which is short and not sweet.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
LAv Committees have
much to answerfor.
(Monday, April 9.)
–MR. Bourke, in
answer to a ques-
tion about reputed
Turkish outrages
- on Christians in
Bosnia and Herzegovina, read long extracts from dispatches of MR.
Holmes, declaring he knew nothing about the outrages referred to,
but giving, instead, particulars of outrages on inoffensive Turks by
offensive Christians. -
According to MR. Hol.MEs, all the mischief in these parts is owing
to the Slay Committees which bring about Christian brigandage
-miscalled insurrection—and that again has naturally drawn on
Turkish retaliation, and then we have a fuss made about “out-
es” and “atrocities.”
R. Holm Es #ſº considers the Turks in Bosnia a very ill-
used race. And MR. Holm Es is on the spot—and has been there
ever so long, and knows all about it—in a general way.
MR. BouhRE evidently enjoyed reading his despatches, as much as
the Ministerial majority hearing them. To be sure MR. FoESTER
was ill-bred enough to ask, even after the reading, whether MR.
Hoºves had been instructed tº inquire into the Kºº. cases of
outrages referred to, and had so inquired; but MR. Bourke pro-
perly rebuked such peddling, rººf curiosity, and declared
that as the Consul was on the spot, he must know 'best what was

worth inquiring into and what wasn't, and that it wasn't for P.
here to be giving him directions, and did MR. ForsTER know what
telegrams to those out-of-the-way places cost? Altogether Boubke's
night wi' Holmes may be pronounced a great success. In Stock-Ex-
change style we should describe the Eastern market: “atrocities
flat; and outrages below par”—with no symptoms of rallying,
except among the more “chaffy” supporters of the Government.
. A good deal of small picking and Fº nibbling and grumbling,
in Supply, but, to the best of Punch's knowledge and belief, not a
enny got rid of. Among the topics of conversation were House of
rds officers in general, their work and pay, and among them
Black-rod in particular, who is to have a fixed salary of £2000
instead of twice as much from fees which now are to be paid
into the Exehequer, out of which JoHN BULL is to make between two
and three thousand a year. It occurs to Punch that, perhaps, those
who pay the fees might claim to be heard in the matter. In
cases of objectionable Office charges, Punch has observed that the
House's notion of reform, and still more the Treasury's, is not
to abolish fees for doing nothing, but to transfer them from the
Officer to the Treasury.
A §: deal of grumbling about the cost of Surveyors and the
number of Surveys under the Merchant Shipping Act. What would
people have P - First they insist on surveyors and surveys, and then
they quarrel because the one find plenty of work to do, and the
other cost money! ... Poor SIR CHARLEs ADDERLEY may complain, as
the drummer did, of the unreasonableness of the man he was flogging,
“Hit high, or hit low, there's no pleasing you.”

Boy sings—“SAYS THE old OBADIAH. To THE Young OBADIAH,
‘I BEGIN To FEEL RATHER DRY.’”
When the Mutiny Bill came on, SIR.A. GoRpoN rose to deprecate
the bringing of the whole body of Militia Officers under that for-
midable measure. MR. PETERTAYLOR complained of the Mutiny
Bill being rammed down his throat at a quarter to one o'clock.
Fancy courteous HARDY ramming *. down anybody's throat,
at any hour, in these mild days. Though he might have been ex-
cused if he had tried to ram something down the throats of that
pestilent pair, BIGGAR and PARNELL, when they rose, like unwhole-
some exhalations, one after the other, against going into Committee,
and HARDY,. amidst a chorus of laughter, at once knocked under
to the infliction.
If this goes on, something will have to be done! The idea of a dis-
cussion on the Mutiny Bill! We shall next have Magna Charta
made matter of a motion by DR. KENEALY.
Tuesday.-SIR. W. BARTTELOT-and no wonder—wants to know
about Outbreaks of Cattle-plague at Willesden. A good many,
besides SIR WALTER, want to know more on this very unpleasant
subject than the Privy, or any other, Council can tell them. One
particularly, ugly fact in the matter is the possibility, if not
more, that it may be the inspectors who disperse the germs of
infection. If that be so, we may well ask, “Quis custodiet ipsos cus-

MR. Q00PER, is to have his Committee on aggravating old
Father Thames's trick, of getting out of his bed in wet weather,
though the Lords are about to have their own Select Committee on
River, Conservancies and their duties, a reference one might have
thought big enough to take in even Father Thames and his tricks.
PETER TAYLOR, that mortal enemy of the “harmless necessary
Cat,” was within 42 of getting it chivied out of the Navy—without
leaving one of its nine tails behind. . Punch is inclined to parody
the Laureate, “The Cat is going—let him go?” Now we have come
down to seven floggings a year, it would seem as if it can hardly be
worth keeping so many Cats to catch so few mice. Still tº.
to know there is a Cat in the cupboard, to be let out of the bag on great
occasions—as Judges like to have a gallows to fall li on, in
extreme cases. But the Navy Cat is doomed, though all know Cats to
be the hardest of diers, and this one seems to carry a life, if not nine
lives, at each of his nine tails.
But if PETER TAYLOR all but triumphed over EGERTON and his
Cat, SIB RoRERT ANSTRUTHER, with nothing stronger than justice
and the national conscience for supporters, completely triumphed
over the Government, on his motion for completing the jº.
still due by England to one of its greatest and most hardly-used
naval heroes, the late LoRD DUNDoNALD. What need to tell the
story that shames us all—of the hero's undeserved disgrace, and
England's—or rather her Ministers'—long delayed atonement for it;
:*. after eighteen years' undeserved exclusion from the
Service he had so helped to make glorious, LoRD DUNDONALD, a
grey-haired, shattered, impoverished, but still unconquered man
was restored to his naval rank-how his pay for all those years of
unmerited exclusion from the field of honour, duty, and service, was
still withheld. -
Thanks to her blood, BRITANNIA has always had the good feeling to
blush for this; and to-night showed she had pluck besides to
brush aside the pitiful pleadings of the Government that would have
sacrificed justice to miserable technicality or more miserable nig-
gardliness. L'Angleterre le veult—and, of course, La Reine le veult-
and so “LETRIGHT RE DONE.” The death-bed demand of the grand
old ill-used Admiral will be granted, and the little he could leave
to the inheritors of his honours will be increased by what the
Government so long kept back from the hero himself.
How, SIR, STAFFoRD Northcore came to play, not for the first
time, the childish game of first squaring up, and then knuckling
down, Punch not knowing cannot say. But call you THIS “leading
of your friends?” Punch calls it sneaking after them.
MR. JAMEs moved to empower the House to poke its nose
into the City Companies—their revenues, and the spending thereof.
The House prefers dipping its beak into their loving-cups, and
tucking its legs under their mahogany. “Not for JAMEs”—such
. matters. The Companies dine too festivously it may be;
ossibly entertain “not wisely but too well; ” but Punch, like Par-
iament, is an honoured guest at the guild-tables, and why should
he, or it, turn round to rend its entertainers ? Else why has
England the inestimable blessing of a Conservative Government?
PEASE seconded the amendment!, Green pease, indeed, if, he
thought anything was to come of it! ... Isaac forbade the sacrifice:
CoTTON thrust himself in the ears of the House to bar hearing of
such an impious demand. Bowyer shot his bolt, and hit that centre
of JoHN BULL's eye, on which is written “private propputy” in
letters of gold. obsyTH, lawyer-like, showed there was “no
case” against the Companies, except, that their dinners were too
good, and had often disagreed with him (FoRSYTH)—the only dis-
agreement that had ever darkened the sweet intercourse between
him and those dear guilds, JENKINs wrestled with SIR A. PEEL for
the SPEAKER's eye, and caught it, but alas! catching the SPEAKER's
eye is not winning the House's ear; and though E. J. discharged a
volley of hard facts, they hurt not, only rattled. And finally the
SoLICITOR-GENERAL laid the verdant wreath of a maiden speech
upon the head of the guardian goddess of Guildhalla—and proved
that the Livery Company was the Club of its day, only on a
grander scale, and with nobler objects mixed with its baser ele-
ments of eating and drinking; and amidst the cheers of a jubilant
majority, deprecated the idea that private property was to be unset-
tled by any impertinent rudeness of the Parliamentary inquiry kind.
Alas, what was JAMEs's powder against such great guns! So
JAMEs got what he deserved—a majority of 96 against him, in a
division of 168 to 72.
On the Town Councils and Local Boards Bill, BIGGAR stopped the
way, as usual.
Wednesday.—MR. WADDY moved his Bill for ºl. º:
tration of Newspaper Proprietors, which MR. Cowen opposed, unless
coupled with repeal of the law which makes newspaper proprietors
criminally as well as civilly responsible for the acts of their employés.
MR. Cowen is a º er proprietor and knows where the shoe
pinches. But everybody knew ...}. MR. WADDY meant his shoe to
pinch—and it was clear that it had 1. in that quarter, when
the Irrepressible Doctor rose to defend those practices of the English-
man which Englishmen condemn. He declared that he had been
ruined by “telling the truth” (!), and that had he been a slave, a
coward, a liar, and a man ready to justify falsehood, he would not
have been in his present position. Now the Doctor's position in the
House may be a painful one, but he was scarcely wise to refer to it
so pointedly. This reference provoked ironical cheers: they provoked
the Doctor into scornful allusion to the “mean quarter” they came
from ; that provoked MR. SULLIVAN into as neat a thonging of
the Doctor and his antecedents—press and other—as Irish cleverness
ever succeeded in veiling, under terms that the SPEAKER could not
take hold of: that º the Doctor, when the Division carried
the House into the lobbies, to call MR. SULLIVAN a naughty and
altogether º name—with no veil whatever; and
that brought MR. SULLIVAN back to tell MR. SPEAKER what the
Doctor had done; that brought the Doctor on his legs—to admit
the naughty name ; and that compelled MR. SPEAKER – after a
moment's hesitation, as the naughty word had been used in the
lobby and not in the House—on the suggestion of MR. FoESTER,
seconded by MR. CRoss, to call on the Doctor to withdraw the
naughty name and apologise for having used it, which the Doctor

A GOOD BEGINNING.
As a student of Natural History and
Esculent Economy, Mr. Punch has much
leasure in quoting the compendious Police

“At Bow Street, SIR JAMEs INGHAM granted
the first summonses, seven in number, under the
Wild Fowls Preservation Act, 39 & 40 Wict.
c. 29, s. 2, against three poulterers and fish-
mongers for fºr in their possession wild
ducks, plovers, &c.”
Since fishmongers turned poulterers by
selling game and wildfowl out of season,
they have lost that special character for
probity which Hamlet gives them when, in
reply to Polonius's disavowal of being a
fishmonger, he rejoins, “Then I would
you were so honest a man.” Nobody can
consider a dealer in habitual complicity
with poachers and the like rogues worthy
to be picked out as an example of honesty.
That virtue, it is to be hoped, will be en-
forced on fishmongers and poulterers by
proceedings under the abovenamed statute,
now that the Press having taken up offences
against it, the Police are taking up the
offenders.

with the Protocol, brought up his Lordship, SIR. W. HARcourt,
MR., FoRSXTH, SIR. C. DILKE, and MR. Gosch EN-to speak for the
Turkish Christians, their claims on Europe, and the duty of en-
Jorcing these on the Turk even by co-operation with Russia and
coercion if need be, under the paramount obligations of duty,
right and humanity—and MR._HARDY, SIR WILLIAM FRAZER,
DR. KENEALY, MR. Roebuck, MR. HANBURY, MR. BuTLER-John-
STONE, and the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchequeB,-to speak for the
Turkish Government, its pluck in resisting the pressure of the
Powers, the º of standing aloof from Russia and coercion, and
the paramount obligations of self-interest. The case on both sides
was put clearly, strongly, and at length; but of course, no motion
came of it, and no division. Mr Hºx does not admit that the
inst word for peace has yet been spoken, though the Pons Asinorum
has broken down. Nothing like hardihood. Punch can º see the

MARRIAGE UNDER DIFFICULTIES.
DEAR MR. PUNCH - -
Hear is a little bit of news, which may be interesting to
some of your Young Lady readers:–
“An Armenian wife, until she becomes a mother, never speaks to anybody
but her husband, excepting in a whisper. She is not allowed even to converse
with her nearest relations. Her jewellery and dress can only be shown to
those of her own sex.”
What a comfort it is that England is not like Armenia! Who
would ever wish to marry, if one was not allowed to speak, excepting
in a whisper, nor to wear one's diamonds when one went out to
dinner P y, half the pleasure of a bride consists in showing her
new finery, and in talking of her trousseau ! and fancy being forced
to do so in a whisper, as though one were ashamed, of it!, To be
sure, Armenian wives may jº exception of their husbands from
their usual mode of whispering, and just conceive, Pººr things, how
they must revel in the privilegel Oh, my goodness! how my tongue
would go at my dear John NY, if I might not raise my voice excepting
when I talked to him GERALDINE GREYMARE
(née BounceR).
CHRISTIANITY PER ADWERTISEMENT.
PUNCH can quite understand the comfort of getting really god-
fearing servants, for they are likeliest to be true to their masters
and their duty. But he doubts if the best way to get them is to
advertise this particular requirement in large letters, as thus, in
these two advertisements—the one from a North of £ngland, the
other from a Scotch, paper:—
ANTED, a capable General WORKING WOMAN, in a small,
quiet family in the country. A Christian at heart, a Teetotaller, and a
Singer would be valued.—Address, &c.
ANTED, as HOUSEKEEPER, a Christian Female. Accustomed to
Poultry.—Address, &c.
A TEETOTAL RECHRISTENINg (for the worst of spirits).-It is a
misnomer to call Gin “Old Tom.” It ought to denominated
“Old Harry.”

- -- - - - - - - - professes to send us
telegrams daily by the
private cable with which he has furnished himself. These messages are not transmitted
to us direct, but through a friend of his, who can interpret the cipher. We do not, for
one moment, throw a # on Our Representative's integrity, but we cannot forget that
one of Our Representatives did not go to India, though he pretended to accºmpany
H.R.H. the PRINCE OF WALEs on his tour, and therefore as “once bitten, twice shy,” we
must make assurance doubly sure (though nothing can double or equal Our Representa-
tive's assurance, if he is not at this moment riding to Khiva) before we offer ourselves as
guarantees to the Public for his good faith. We publish his last letter before starting,
which we consider as an important item in the case.
DEAR SIR,
THE horse suited me to a T. He has been packed up, so much paid on account,
and he is now off for Dover. Of course I shall not ride him this side of the Channel.
My equestrian career will begin between Paris and St. Petersburg. At one time I had
got a great mind (I always have a great mind, so that's nothing new) to ride to Khiva on
a bicycle. . But for political reasons, which you will §: I have given up the idea.
I was afraid that some confusion would arise in the Mahommedan or Russian mind between
*. and Protocol; and any complication at this moment should be, particularly,
avoided.
I enclose the list of subscriptions for my Journey to Khiva. They look very well:—

amount down, and promises, I have started—
or, I should say, before you receive this, I
shalihave started ; for
I'm off to Khiva early in the morning,
I'm off to Khiva afore de broke o' day !
I'll fill my bag with lots of little yellow boys,
I’m off to Khiva afore de broke of day !
And so farewell for the present. You’ll

communication, and the distance to be travelled

as nothing happened of any consequence.
was belated for one night, and ran short of
F. ; but - you know what a good
gerdemainist I am – well, I made an
omelette in º hat, drank a glass of Pommard
(this sounds like something for the hair, but it
isn't, when properly pronounced) from the
inexhaustible bottle º tricks are worth a
traveller's while to learn—and for a soldier
the cannon-ball in the hat is most useful, -of
course I have the whole bag of tricks with me),
made an orange tree grow, took an orange for
dessert, and went to sleep. Next afternoon I
was ready—aye ready. e for fifty miles.
7.30 A.M.–Came on a dead Flat. No name or
address. Wondered who he was. Telegraphed
to Necropolis Company to say there was a job
on hand, would they undertake it?
8.50.-Wery cold. Saw a Frozen Sound.
This will give you some idea of what NEGRETTI
i
AND ZAMBRA might mean when they say,
“How cold, it has been to-day !” Always
thought (till I knew they sold barometers)
that NEGRETTIAND ZAMBRA were clog-dancers,
or nigger duettists, at a Music Hall, with a
breakdown. Wonderful sight a Frozen Sound.
Perhaps it was the last sound uttered by the
dead Flat. I put it into my cornet-d-piston,
and blew it to warm it. “No effects,” as they
say at my bank, My Driver, who accompanies
me on a sleigh (this isn't a musical instrument,
so you mustn't be misled when I say he
“accompanies me on it”), observed that “he
thought it was an echo from the hills, which
had lost its way, and been frozen to death.”
12 mid-day-Stopped to lunchski, as we
call it in this country. The Driver eats tallow
candles, wheel grease, and drinks wickski—a
Russian spirit distilled from candle-ends. A
Russian never takes a bath, he always goes in
for a dip.
2,-Between Drjnkomaviski and Bakkakhan.
Lost our way, and dined with a farmer. He
said, he thought there wouldn't be any war.
At least he hadn't heard anything about it:
After dinner, Islept in a pigstye, and resumed
my journey at 4 A.M. Too with me a little
pig. ºi. chap, he squealed very much,
and nearly woke the farmer, who would have
been grieved to part with him. So I put a
gagin its mouth, and thus avoided what might
have been a painful scene. Removed gag when
at a distance of two miles from the farm. I

... IN a column of news the following remark
is made in the Morning Post respecting an
oddly named liquor described as “this in-
defectible wine”:—
“LoRD Boling BRoxE (we think) maintained
ridicule was the test of truth: the Spécialité
Sherry has passed this test most amply, for it
has had no small share of ridicule; but, in spite
of all, it holds its own.”
But non constat that because ridicule is
the test of truth, it is also the test of wine.
Nobody dreams of ridiculing true port or
sherry, although one .# and twenty-
six gallons of them, we know, make a butt.
Suppression by Hose and Jet.
THE House of Commons_laughed con-
sumedly when ever-vigilant PETER TAYLOR
described the very original way of, the
Holborn Westry of bringing the law to bear
on the Sunday traders in Leather Lane,
viz., by drenching their goods with car-
bolic acid from a water-cart. The Westry
must have borrowed the notion from re-
corded cases of mobs dispersed by fire-
engines. The Westry deserves the credit
of having discovered a short, sharp, and
decisive process for #: is, no
doubt, to all respectable Holborners, a ve
serious nuisance; though, §. suna

may have something to say on the matter.
But is the Westry quite sure that the pale

leisure for teaching the pig.
11 A.M.–Pig already beginning to master his letters. Ifancy some
one has given him his rudiments before. There is a twinkle in his
eye that I don't half like. One thing is comparatively reassuring,
he does not show much aptitude for cards.
Friday-Came to a sign-post.. Examined it. Found I had been
for two days riding towards Persia. Worked my compass and took
a turn to the right. ..After lunchski, had half a game at Beggar
my Neighbour with the Pig, and rode on. Pig improving, but still
stupid. He will cry whenever he sees the Ace of Spades, and I can't
make out why. The sleigh-driver doesn't know.
6 P.M.–Cold and raw. So cold and so raw that I shall be very
glad when it's hot and quite done. Arrived at a shebeenski rejoicin
in the sign of . The Rose, Bud, Called for some of their best, an
“nipped” it in the Bud. Gaye # a drop of strong wickski.
It made his tail curl. Piggy vain of the effect, but evidently much
pleased, and wanted to play, me at écarté. Refused. But what I
will do is to teach Piggy All Fours. If he learns it, I can make a
fortune, as no one knows the game out here. Sat up all night
hard at work with Piggy. Driver asleep.
Next Day.-Met a Tartar Gentleman on the road. He asked us to
share his er with him—potski-luckski, as they call it here.
We accepted; my sleigh-driver, myself, and the pig... The Tartar
Gentleman got the worst of it...at, dinner, as we were three to one.
After dinner played him at All Fours. The Tartar Gentleman won
the first game, but we §: three more. Cleared him out of his
roubles, and rode on quickly in the direction of Khiva.
The Tartar Gentleman subsequently rode away to the nearest
Police Station. In . of this, we had a difficulty later on
at a Russian Stashunhouski, but fortunately made friends with the
Inspektorski, who was much amused with the Pig's tricks, also with
myomelette in the hat, inexhaustible bottle, and little Joey in the
bag. I gave him an invitation to on me whenever he might be
coming to town, and then rode on, briskli, as we say in Russia, in
the direction of Khiva. Rub a Russian the right way, and you
won't catch a Tartar. . Expect next telegram in a couple of days, as
snow-storms have set in, and there's a talk of Wolves coming down
and attacking Travellers. Now for real excitement!
I don't wish to throw any discredit on a gallant_officer, but no
one knows CAPTAIN BURNABY on the road that I am riding to
Khiva. Odd. ...Just heard a Wolf in the distance. If one comes
too near, I shall mention MR. GLADSTONE's name to him, and see if
that will frighten him. No signs of one at present. Great cry, but
very little Wolf.

COOL, VERY
. THE following impudent advertisement appeared the other day in a widely-
circulated Western paper:—
A Comfortable HOME OFFERED, in a Clergyman's family, in South Devon, to a
Lady willing to pay £40 a year and devote some time daily to instruction (good
French and German).-Address, &c.
The young Lady, who wrote to the address given with this wonderfully cool
offer received the following reply, which Punch thinks worth giving verbatim —
“MADAM, MR. — has commissioned me to reply to your letter received this morn-
ing. MR. —is a widower; I have managed his household since his wife's death, for the
last six years. Besides MR.— and myself, the family consists of two young ladies, aged
sixteen and eighteen, and two little boys, eight and eleven respectively; the younger of
these you would be required to teach, as he is backward. I think one hour a day would be
sufficient for him at first. Could you teach the rudiments of Latin * as he would ultimately
require it. Good French and German is necessary for the young ladies. They are pre-
º g for the Cambridge Local, and attend classes under a Master for the other branches,
usic included; at the same time they would much value any assistance you could give
them in their Énglish studies, by way of explanation, in Grammar and Arithmetic, for
instance. They have no time at present for Drawing, but might be glad of it afterwards.
May I ask if you Sing? I can most decidedly promise you a comfortable and happy
home. We are a few minutes' walk from the sea, and the Plymouth Hoe is a pleasant
promenade. The Devonshire scenery is very good. The young ladies, I think, would be
able to take in French and German about three times a week, about two hours each day,
as their time at present is very much taken up; however, this, if you come to us, you
could talk over with them. Would you mind sharing a large and airy bed-room with
them, if necessary? as I hardly know yet whether I should be able to offer you a separate
one. ... You would find them pleasant and ladylike girls. We have one or two local
associations in the town, if you like joining the classes. I think I have now mentioned
all particulars, and shall be pleased to hear from you as soon as possible.—Believeme, &c.”
The young Lady replied, expressing her regret that she could not avail
herself of these proffered advantages.
“The truth is" (she added) “I have accepted an engagement at a salary of £100 a year,
where my duties will be scarcely heavier than with you, and where I shall have a large
and airy room for my own separate use. I trust this delay will
cause you no inconvenience in dealing with the many applica-
tions you have doubtless received, and hope you may soon meet
with a lady, knowing four languages thoroughly, who, in return
for her meals and the third part of a bed-room, will be glad to
pay you £40 a year, and devote her time and acquirements to
your service.” -
BIRDS AND BRUTES.
BLossoms on blackthorn bush are white;
On whitethorn opening leaves are gredn.
There's dandelion blazing bright;
There's shiny lesser celandine.
And there in yonder lane those three—
Where nigh the bank cow-parsley grows
"Mid nettles—did you ever see
Three more unlovely Cads than those P
Ill-favoured, unwashed, grimy knaves!
What is it that the fºllows do
With nets and cages, traps and staves?
And on a Sunday morning too!
Bird-catchers they, their cruel trade
ho recklesse’en in close-time ply,
And the Act 'gainst such caitiffs made
In favour of poor birds, defy.
An Act by hands unskilful framed,
In phrase derisive styled “Tom-tit’s.”
In which the Chaffinch ne'er is named,
And which the Linnet too omits.
And so their traps yon wretches lay,
And spread their toils from hindrance free.
“We’re catchin' Chaffinches,” they say;
Or, “Only arter Linnets we.”
“What songsters else are those, then, pray,
Gh you in several cages bear P."
“Qh, them, they're call-birds, all o' they ;
We ain't cotch none o' them birds there.”
“Say is there green in Punch's eye,
..That with such chaff he should {. * had ' P "

Thou dirty, graceless, vulgar Cad!
“For Goldfinch, Greenfinch, Mavis, Merle,
And warblers all, thy snares are set.
For soundreis fresh from early purl,
All's bird, that comes within the net.
“Where's the Police P. might be our cry,
To collar thee and all thy crew.
Too oft they’ve other fish to fry—
Offenders even worse than you.
“But when they can, your little game
They are the gamekeepers to end.
For whom more fitting can we name
Than Bobby, to be Dicky's friend?..”
“Come, mild Persuasion!”
IN consequence of the report of the Committee on
Railway Accidents, the Government—so says MR. AD-
DERLEY--is going to confer with the Railway Companies,
to see what steps in the way of protecting the lives of
their servants and passengers they are ing to take,
voluntarily—not upon compulsion, mind. The Govern-
ment hates compulsion “like an unfilled can.” Like Sir
John Falstaff—“If reasons were as plentiful as black-
berries, they would not give one upon compulsion.”
Their rule is, in fact, the reign of may, not must. After
refusing to coerce Turks, with what consistency could
they coerce Railway Companies?

AESTHETIC ECONOMY.
LAST number of “Fors Cla-
vigera” is curious as well as
interesting, on account of
the details there given of
the author's budget. MR.
RUSKIN, in his own words,
has “unveiled the statue of
his economy,” and, though
no one who reads will accuse
him of ostentation, it would
be difficult to say .
what it is that has prompte
imitators of the great art-
critic's out-spokenness to
besiege Mr. Punch's letter-
box. Among the letters called
into existence by the example
of this high aesthetic autho-
rity, the following may be
cited:—
To Mr. Punch, Fleet Street.
SIR, April 1.
You will be glad to
hear that, on the death of
my father, who was a cele-
brated Liverpool miser, I
inherited a sum producing
- something like £70,000 per
annum, which placed me above absolute want. My first financial
investment was the purchase of a lovely wife of good family. By this
transaction I realised considerably, as I introduced some excellent
mortgages to my wife's relations, and disposed of much shaky pro-
erty to an immense advantage. I thought it rather hard on my own
}. that my father should have left them nothing, and volun-
teered to invest their small fortunes in some excellent Companies of
which I am paid Director. I relieved my conscience at the same
time by purchasing for my wife a splendid suite of diamonds, left in
pawn by a well-known Duchess. I have since assisted a young relation
to a permanent situation in Portland Island, and am serenely łº
in the certainty, so far as anything human is certain, that Is º

To – Punch, Esq.
DEAR PUNCH, -
“Awch'io son pittore.” I’m an artist, and generally con-
sidered a man of taste. I came in, a few years ago, to a fortune of
£30,000, which I inherited from an uncle who was good enough to
make room for me by joining his ancestors. My first extravagance
was the purchase of a grand collection of spurious Majolica, imita-
tion bronzes, and counterfeit china, for which I gave the modest
sum of £2000. This necessitated naturally the lease of a set of
apartments in the Albany, where I flatter º: the dinners I give
from week to week are already celebrated among the best bon-
vivants in London.
After studying Art and the Museums, my aesthetic tastes would
not permit a man of culture to retain the mass of falsehood on my
walls with which I had been satisfied at starting. When I trans-
ferred my interest in these I lost about £1995 upon the transaction.
However, by the judicious ºpºlº. of £18,000, I soon became
the º possessor of some of the best examples of the arts of
CELLINI, PALIssy, BUHL, and others, besides hanging on my walls

persuaded that when I have sold my lease, collections, and plate, I
shall not be in a #. I satisfy my Israelitish friends—to
leave even hay for life to my Cousin's pet donkey, the only creature
with whom I have any personal sympathy.
I beg to remain, yours, poorer * ever,

(MRs. GINGHAM communicates her Qpinions on_Plain Cooking, and
the pertness of certain Newspaper Parties.)
“The real difficulty about cooking is that it is in the hands of woman, and
that woman is too ethereal a creature to interest herself in the matter. She
is rather like Calypso, who partook of nectar and ambrosia, while she saw
that her mortal guest had pork, almost always pork, and Pramnian wine.
Woman, for her part, could live on tea and bread-and-butter for ever, with
an occasional egg once or twice a week. These things are her nectar and
ambrosia, and as long as man has his barbaric joint she thinks that all is
well. The English joint is the bane of domestic life. . . . “Plain cooking,”
says a doctor, “is an abomination; avoid it as you would poison. If you are
tired of life, I can find other means of ridding you of it. Plain cooking,' this
outspoken physician goes on, “brings more grist to our mill than miasmas,
drains, or either extreme of temperature.’”—Daily News.

Who feels no respect for sirloin and is rudë to leg o' mutton.

Or, as ToM says—that lad's so smart—our national joint-security.
Plain Cooking? It's a precious boon our land alone possesses.
Don't tell me of your German mucks nor yet of your French messes.
This fad for foreign feeding's rot; the Swells may patronise it,
But no, not me, nor yet my sort—we utterly despise it.
I don't ask JoHN to “live on pork and Pramnian wine for ever.”
(Which I wonder what that wine may be? Must ask young Tont-
he's clever.) -
But if an English joint’s his bane, plain cooked as I can cook it,
He’d better hire a Parleyvoo, and as for me—I’ll hook it!

MR. BUMBLE was thrown into a violent fit of indignation by the

“FEMALE GUARDIANs.-0n Saturday Miss MAUD STANLEY, cousin of
DEAN STANLEY, was elected a guardian of St. Anne's, Soho.”
The election of Ladies to the office of Guardian is regarded by
MR. BUMBLE as a most unporochial innowation. He is highly scan-
dalised to see that it is an increasing 'abit, and thinks the rate-
payers might just as well put them wicious º: under the wings
of guardian hangels at once; which would be making the work-
house the wery rewerse of the place as it was intended for.

A WARNING TO NOWEL-READERS.
Ayºry vulgar and silly book, Fº to be a novel of high life, has been
published by a person signing himself by a ducal title with a foreign ring
unknown to the Almanach de Gotha. In this offensive work real persons are
introduced under the thinnest disguises. Anyone who knows anything about
English society will throw the book down in utter disgust at its prurient,
ignorant, and offensive caricature. However, as certain scandal-lovers of the
lower middle class may be enticed to buy the book with a notion of finding in
it what they may, in their innocence, believe to be a true picture of the Upper
Ten, Punch begs to furnish a sample of the sort of thing that they may expect
to get for their money:—
CHAPTER XLVII.
It was ten o'clock in the supper-room at BLACK's Club in St. James's Street.
The waiters were moving about amongst the members, on the look-out for tips.
BLACK's is the most fashionable Club in London, and many are the twopences
that find their way into the hands of the pampered menials (masses of gold,
velvet, and hair powder) who wait upon the patricians of the Metropolis.
At one of the tables (that, like the rest, was groaning under the weight of
artificial flowers and costly plate) sat three “men” eating their supper.
§: these “men” (as even their Graces Lord Dukes are sometimes called
in Mayfair) had been drinking champagne and eating patés de foies gras. The
first was a foreigner. He was called PRINCE Won DIsMARCK, and had been
Prime Minister to His Imperial Majesty the EMPEROR of GHERMANY. The next
was MR. SADSTONE, an ex-Cabinet Minister. The last was the Right Honour-
able the EARL of DEAconsfiFLD–a new creation, and therefore not of great
account in Mayfair. -
“Where shall we go?” said MR. SADSToxE. “Prince, my Lord, what do you
say to the Alhambra?”
‘I prefer the Cambridge Music Hall in Shoreditch,” replied his Lordship,
filling his tankard with a fresh supply of “dry creaming.” “I am blasé wi
West-End pleasures. Let us go ‘east of Temple Bar.’”
And with a joyous laugh the three “men”. left BLACK's, and throwing
themselves on to the %. a private coach-and-four, rattled down St. James's
Street en route for the City.
In the meanwhile LoRD BROMPTON was still talking in the bay window to
his brother, the MARQUIs or IsLINGTON. -
amused, and repeated the story afterw
“The DUCHESs of DITCHWATER's soirée, my Lord,”
said the elder F. to his young relative, “was
certainly dull. I give you my word that I couldn't get
anything more substantial than a
supper. They had no ‘fizz," and
watered.” -
“My Lord Marquis, you are right,” replied the 3.
aristocrat, with a bow. “It is very strange that in
societyº”. can't get such luxuries of the season as those
supplied by the lowest cad giving a Bayswater hop...I
always bribe the Greengrocer when I visit her Grace, till
he brings me some cold fowl.”.
At this sally several young aristocrats laughed heartily
—their experience had been the same.

him hurriedly.
“My Lord,” he whispered, “at last by your emotion I
have divined your secret. Last night at the DUCHESs of
BANCHESTEB's dance I saw you footing a schottische with
the LADY BLANCHE TEMPLEBARs, much to the disgust
of her noble mother, her GRACE THE DUCHESs of ScAR-
Bobough. Tell me, my Lord, do you love the gal?”
“I do, my Lord Marquis,” replied the * noble-
man, firmly, “but I know it is of no use. I am a younger
son, and shall never be able to afford the bundle of five
pound notes, which LADY BLANCHE. (were she my wife)
would use for making her cigarettes. What is blue
blood without £ s. d. 2 I have been born under the
shadow of a coronet, and I have scarcely enough money
to . champagne for breakfast. I wish I had been born
a snob, on my soul I do!”
“Stuff and nonsense, my, Lord,” said the Marquis.
“And now which of you titled chaps are game for the
Gardens?”
There was a shout of laughter, and the young aristo-
crats, leaving BLACK's, threw themselves into Victorias
(each harnessed to three horses arranged tandem-wise),
and drove to Kremorne.
Within five minutes all the young Lords were talking
and chaffing with pleasant companions.
LoRD BRoyPTON soon forgot his love in shooting for
nuts, and, when the time for the fireworks had arrived,
was quite heart whole.
He was on the eve of following the crowd to a distant
part of the gardens, when the Marquis arrived, bringing
with him a friend, clothed in rather gorgeous garments.
“My Lord!” cried the Marquis, “let me introduce
MR. S.Nooks to you. SNooks, this is my brother l’”
The Gentlemen and the Nobleman bowed to one another.
“I am trying to persuade him to come home with us,”
continued the Marquis, “as I want.to introduce him to
our brother and the Marchioness, and their Ladyships,
out. Sistens FANNY, FLORENCE, SUSANNA, and Gwendo-
LINE.’
“Who is he, my Lord?” whispered LoBD BRoMPTON,
“The Lion Comique,” replied the Marquis. “I tell
you what, my Lord, he is no end of a stunning cove!”
And then the two Noblemen and the Comic Singer
returned together to Grosvenor Square.
His brother approached

NYº:
A ND has it come to this! So completely has the Asses' Bridge broken down, that it
º gannot even support a night's talk in the Lords. On Monday, April 16, LoRD
GRAN VILLE was booked to call attention to the Protocol, but, as in the case of
\ Glendower's call of spirits from the vasty deep, Punch must ask, like Hotspur,
\\ “will it come P’’ It would seem not; for the audience of the Upper House,
- * \ w not the densest—Punch begs pardon, not the most crowded—as a rule, hardly
rose beyond the average to hear what LoRD GRAN VILLE had to say against, and
LoRD DERBY for the extinguisher that has taken—or is taking—fire.
W = \- De mortuis nil nisi bonum is a rule for Lords as for Commons. The Pro-
tocol is dead. As nothing good can be said of the deceased diplomatic abortion,
the only alternative is to say nothing. LoRD, DERBY said nothing, at consi-
derable, length. The MARquis of LANspowNE and the EARL of DUDLEY said their dittos to Loºp GRANVILLE. The Protocol having
received its fitting “finis” from four flat speeches, the conversation collapsed; and the Protocol, with its declarations, passes away into
the large limbo of Diplomatic Fizzles.
.(Commons.)—MR. Bourke has received a partial return of arrests, sentences, and executions of sentences on account of the Bulgarian
uprising, and is ready to table them whenever MR. GLADSTONE will move. . A partial return, no doubt, it must be, omitting, as it does,
the name of eyery Moslem of rank or note who took the lead in the atrocities. While AcHMET, SHE FRET, and Toosoon, so far from
being punished for their share in the Bulgarian horrors, have been promoted, MR. Bourke may as well put the Turkish returns in his
ipe, and smoke them, as lay them on the table of the House. TVestigia nulla retrorsum (“I make no returns”) might be the
urks' motto for massacres and massacred alike. “Why should I, when f.: retrace my steps nor punish my offenders?”
The Pera Correspondent of the Times, the other day, reported the bastinadoing to death of one NASIM, a student in the military school
at Constantinople, who had ventured to draw up a memorial demanding the recall of MIDHAT. Musu.BUs PASHA has categorically
denied the fact. That is Mosuºus PASHA's business. MR. Jocelyn now repeats the denial, and so does the Telegraph Correspondent.
The last declares he has seen and identified NASIM. That is evidence or would be if the identification is clear. .. - -
Let us hope the story is not true, and that its falsehood is disprovable by something more trustworthy than Turkish official denials.
A lively debate on the Mutiny Bills, Army and Navy, with lots of amendments moved. This is a novelty. PARNELL, PowRR, and
SULLIVAN, to say nothing of PETER TAYLOR, all busy in moving reductions ofHº. from solitary confinement to the Cat
upwards. , MR.PARNELL, was rude enough to ask MR. WARD HUNT how he would like, if he unfortunately fell asleep on hº to incur
the punishment of penal, servitude, death, or imprisonment with hard, labour. Really, that is rather too personal, MR, PARNELL.
Besides, you forget the First Lord's excuse if he should fall asleep on the Treasury Bench (which we presume is his Parliamentary

-to approve the Admiralty patternſ. We recommend a Naval Cat
Show—as a succursale to the feline display at the Crystal Palace—
with a Naval Lord in attendance, to explain the points of the
Cat approved of by the Admiralty!
Tuesday.—As dull as ditch-water in Parliament, in both Lords
and Commons. My Lords were on Legal Education. The Inns of
Qourt don't like my LoRD SEIBORNE's Bill. Legal Education is the
Benchers' business, not my LoBD SELBoRNE's. Who is he, that he
should set up to overhaul the Benchers, and educate the Bar? LoRD
CAIRNs is the Benchers' organ, and grinds their favourite tune
of Auld Lang Stºne. The pious PALMER will not reach his legal
Holy Land this pilgrimage.
(Commons.)—MR. KNATCHBULL-HUGEssen could move the abolition
of the Railway Passenger Duty, but could not move the CHANGELLOR
QF THE ExchequER to give up the £600,000 it produces, nor the non-
Directorial element of the House to see any sufficient reason why he
should. Though potent, the Railway Directors do not yet direct
the House of Commons. MR. K.-H., as the clever author of some
capital fairy tales, should publish one with a transformation
beyond, all the wonders of fairy-land, and as yet adventured in
no published volume of fairytales or Christmas transformation-scene
—the transformation of Railway Passengers' duties, into the duties
of Railway Directors'. . And if, after setting forth the latter, he
could get the Directors to do it! As for the £600,000, there is a pre-
ing impression that if the CHANCELLOR OF THE ExcBEQUER were
to give it up, it would be to find its way not into passenger pockets,
but shareholders'. The passengers prefer, for the present, to take

out their share in the shape of duty. When they find Directors
showing an amiable concern for passengers in other matters, they
will be ready, perhaps, to give them credit for paternal anxiety to
save their pockets in the matter of the Railway Duty.
EARL PERCY moved the rejection of the Motion, and the CHAN-
CELLOR of THE ExchEQUER declined to give up the money. So
MR. KNATCHBULL-HUGEssen withdrew his Motion, and the Earl his
Amendment.
But the fun to-night was out of the House in the great Donkey
Demonstration, which Punch has immortalised in another part of
his columns. It was a touching sight to see WHALLEY conductin
DE MoRGAN and the Rump of the heroic ten who managed to reac
the Lobby, to the Tea-Room, and there treating them to the “cup

is WHALLEY to LoRD GEORGE GoRDON. -
As for DE MoRGAN–“who leads great asses should himself be
ass.” And he seems perfectly to possess the qualification. ---
There was a DE MoRGAN-mighty in mathematics and pitiless
Fº of paradoxes. We can imagine the Q.E.D. he would
ave arrived at over his namesake. A good deal like Punch's,
elsewhere.
With WHALLEY and KENEALY in the House, and DE MoRGAN out
of it, the Unfortunate Nobleman in Dartmoor is even more unfor-
tunate than his worst friends have painted him.
Wednesday.—When the foreign steamer Franconia smashed the
Strathclyde, within two miles of Dover, no law could be enforced
against the foreign offenders, the Court of Appeal holding, by seven
men to six, that our Courts had no jurisdiction.
MR. GoRST now seeks to stretch the grasp of the law over foreigners
within a three-mile range of the coast. Something will have to
be done; but it was agreed, after a legal talk—SIR. G. Bowy ER
STAVELY HILL, WHEEL House, and Forsyth against the Bill, and
SIR. W. HARcouBT and the ATToRNEY-GENERAL not exactly for it, but

discriminando—that the Government should do it. So GoRST made
way for CRoss—in due time.
MR. ANDERson wants to assimilate the law of Scotland as to
Married Women's Property to the law of England. And what for
no? Unless it be, that your canny wedded Scot's grip of the siller–
his wife's as well as his ain—is too strong to be f. even by
law, if he can help it.
MontgomeBIE against, McLAREN and MR. Ewing for the Bill. SIR
G. CAMPBELL pathetic on the horror of converting wedlock into
“chumming,” and ºf the Scottish marriage tie to the Ma-
hometan. This a new view of Moslem marriage. Punch had always
thought the objection to that was from the point of polygamy, not
property. But what SIR GEORGE objects to is not that the Turkish law
allows too many wives, but that it makes all the wives independent in
money matters. In fact, it would seem, according to SIR GEORGE,
that the most Terrible Turk, in wedded life, is the one in petticoats.
Thence, perhaps, the usage, among the Turkish ladies of wearing
*—however baggy, still unmistakeably of the unmentionable
orcier.
The Bill was read a Second Time, but with a distinct intimation
from the Lord Advocate, that Scottish women should not have an
inch more right over their own than English.
Thursday (Lords).-LoRD ENFIELD called attention, not before it
is wanted, to the unsanitary condition of the Public Offices, old
and new—the newest, to the shame of somebody-suppose we sa
BRITANNIAP—about the worst. Is it irony of the powers that watc
over official undertakings, that the basement of the Office, which
keeps such central eye and hand as are kept over the drainage of
town and country, has been fairly flooded with liquid sewagº like the
lover of HoRACE's Pyrrha, “Liquidis perfusus odoribus,” though
not exactly, “ Grato sub antro,” but in a stinking cellar. Or is it
the Board's offences of omission in sewerage matters that are being
brought home to its own doors, in the form of liquid sewage?
LoRD BEACONSFIELD promises *.*.*.* of the Augean
stables of Whitehall and Pall Mall by that rather shaky Hercules,
the Board of Works.
LoRD STRATHEDEN AND CAMPBELL showed at once his simple-
mindedness and oddity by another, last word for the Treaty of
Paris, 1856. Let this be written on his Lordship's tombstone—may
it be long before it is erected!—“He believed to the last in the
Treaty of Paris, 1856.”
LoRD RoseBERY did show how we might be put in an awkward
fix under the Tripartite Treaty of the same year, if either Austria
or France appealed to its obligations. But, as LoRD DERBY took
comfortin pointing out to the House, they haven’t, and are not likely
to. So the Tripartite may go, with its predecessor, “Where de old
Treaties go.”. - -
His Lordship should issue a new treatise. “On Treaties and their
Obligations,” Punch offers him some mottoes:—
“De non existentibus et non apparentibus, eadem est ratio.”
“A Treaty that the signataries don't insist on is no Treaty.”
“Circumstances alter cases.”
“Sufficient for the time being is the Treaty thereof.”
“No bother, no bond.”
(Commons).-Much miscellaneous talk, including a conversation
on a department with the objectionable name of the Petty Bag Office.
Punchis sorry to learn that petty-bagging has rather increased than
diminished under the Judicature Act, so that MR. W. H. SMITH
finds it impº to abolish the office that works the petty bag
business. Punch had flattered himself all these official petty-bag-
gings had been done away with.
On report of the Mutiny Act, repetitions of the lively debates
and divisions on Second Reading by PARNELL, BIGGAR, Powek, and
their followers of the Irish Obstructive Brigade. They are evidently
going in to curry favour with the Forces, as the “poor” soldiers'
and sailors' friends. GENERAL SHUTE said the one thing worth re-
cording in the night's talk—that “want of discipline was the failing
of the age. There was a want of discipline in the Church, and at
the Bar. He might even say he believed there was a want of dis-
cipline in that House.” I believe you, Mon Général/
Another talk on theincidence of Imperial Taxation." MR. GoscHEN
doubted the Budget calculations, the CHANCELLOR of THE ExchE-
QUER stands by them. He pointed out that if new taxation had been
needed, there is always, the Income-Tax. And the Inexhaustible
#.i. STAFFORD. As SIR WILFRID might say,+“Don’t pass

Friday (Lords).-LoRD CAMPERDown raised the ugly question
why, after CAPTAIN HoHART, R.N., was dismissed, our Service
in 1868 for accepting service with the Turk without leave of the
Admiralty, HoßARTIPAsHA was in 1874 restored to our Service,
whence he is now drawing £400 a fi half-pay. LoRD DERBy
could only admit the fact, with a feeble attempt at explanation,
which explained nothing.
We are still at peace with Turkey and Russia.
But they may
any day be at war with each other.
ould not Russia have some-
. to say, and with reason, to an English Rear-Admiral com-
manding the Turkish from-clads? A question to be asked, and not
to be answered except in one Nº. striking CAPTAIN, Hobart off
the Navy List—(on which, with all his unwillingness to hit a British
sailor, Punch must say the Captain ought never to have been re-
º: while he wore Turkish uniform)—from the date of the
eclaration of war between Russ and Turk.
(Commons.)—The House thrilled to-night with a common pulse
as the country thrilled next morning, at the news of the rescue o
the five Welsh miners from their ten days' living burial in the
Troedyrhiw mine. God bless the brave fellows who risked, their
lives to rescue their brethren I It is something to have set thirty-
two million hearts beating to one tune. It is something to be one
of these thirty-two million hearts, and to feel one's heartbeat the
throbbing link between oneself and thirty-one millions ninehundred
and ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and º
And then, to take down its excitement, the House wentin, as
if it really meant it, on MR. HANBURY TRACY's waggish suggestion
of an official staff of Reporters, to give verbatim reports of the
Parliamentary talk! of Biggar and PARNELL! Had he been
serious? Think of the House weekly or monthly confronted with
its own verbiage! “Litera scripta manet,” too." “The evil that
men do, lives after them;”for that we have SHARspeARE's warrant.
But that the rot they talk should live after them as well!–Deus
avertat."
The House dabbled with the appalling idea, as seeming-reckless
men might play with a loaded shell, knowing—the rogues—all the
time there wasn't alight within a league of them. -
No. Parliament is safe enough from verbatim reports, till a
BiggaR and a PARNELL–twin obstructives risen to con- and de-
structive—are set loose to work their wicked wills upon the Saxon
speechmaker.

That those defiant

“Stern men and true” got deci-

More easily than congregated;
That the arithmetic of bluster
Is always falsified at muster;

That geese will stray when given free room,
And that the House of Commons tea-room
With counsel and applause from WHALLEY,

That loud DE MoRGAN can but bray
Like other “mokes,” and lose his way;
That blatant TYLEH and erass SKIrwöRTH
Are scarcely serious Satire's whip worth;
In fine, that the egregious three
Are utter donkeys—Q. E. D. 1
That Rowland TYLER is not WAT;
That muffs who swear they'd rather rot
In dungeon than as recreants live,
Would funk what Beak might haply give;
That martyrdom is not their walk,
When “rot” is mainly all their talk;
That 'tis an anti-climax rather
When fools who in their thousands gather,
Have to º: ten leading “gabs”
To charge the foe in four-wheeled cabs'
FOR THE MASTER OF THE MUSIC OF THE FUTURE.
THE following Regulations have been issued by the Police for the maintenance of order
º of the Great Composer on the occasion of the Wagner performances
at the e :-
The Public will be admitted to the Albert Hall on presentation of vouchers signed by
HEBR WAGNER or HERR. DANNREUTHER, and on production of a certificate from any two
Professors of Æsthetics in any University at home or abroad.
No person who has ever been heard to scoff at the Music of the Future, or is known
:* MozART's, BEETHoven's, or MENDELssoRN's works to the Recitatives in Lohengrin
and the Ring der Nibelungen, or who has ever confessed to having derived pleasure from
the *: of AUBER or Rossinſ, BELLINI or DoNIZETTI, or who has at any time degraded
himself so far as to listen to the º: of OFFENBACH, HERVá, Lecocq, or STRAUss,
will on any account be admitted to the honour of assisting in this audition.
Anyone of the audience assembled who shall blow any one's trumpet but that of
RICHARD, WAGNER (always excepting the ninety-nine trombones in the orchestra), or
who shall sneeze, cough, or blow, his own nose, or any one else's, during the ceremony,
or who shall show, any sign of disapproval or weariness, either by j. word, gesture,
exclamation, or whisper, shall, on detection, be removed by the police agents at the first
pause in the programme. -
Only specified admirers will be permitted to bring up to the dais on which the august
WAGNER will be enthroned crowns, wreaths, or bouquets for his acceptance.
All crowns must be of gold or silver-gilt. Wreaths and bouquets to be composed of the
costliest exotics. -
The Police have *i. orders to prevent the audience in their enthusiasm carrying
HEER WAGNER round the Galleries, or crowding to kiss his hand, so as to impede his
respiration, or otherwise interfere with his personal comfort.
# powerful, lime-light will throw a halo round the head of the Professor during the
performance.
Three of the most noted aurists of Savile Row will be in attendance at the Hall for the
reparation of defective : 8.
-volatile and chloric gether, for the use of persons of exceptionally fine-strung nerves,
may be had in the basement of the Hall, on
; ication to the Chemist of the Medicines of
the Future, who will have his laboratory on
the premises, with every description of restora-
tive appliance and apparatus. -
Special trains will run from the Kensington
High Street Station to Colney Hatch, Hanwell,
and Earlswood after each concert.
OUT OF RANGE.
WE rejoice to hear that the British Arm
already possesses an excellent range-finder, an
has only to bring it into use and train men to
work it in all branches of the Service. This is
very ...; , and all would be well did
but the Britis y possess also the following
useful articles:–
A Commander-in-Chief who did not disap-
prove of his own General Qrders. - -
A Field-Marshal who did not rest his claims
to distinction upon his years rather than his
laurels. -
A Mobilisation Scheme that did not exist
only on *ś. -
A War-Office which did not quarrel with the
Indian Department. -
An Indian Department which did not, when-
ever possible, snub and ignore the Horse-
Guards. -
A Reserve able to fill up ugly gaps in the
event of our Army being called on for serious
operations.
And, lastly, a few more horses, a good many
more guns, and, if it could be managed with-
out quite breaking the back of BRITANNIA, &
great many more stalwart men in her Line and
our Reserve.
STANZAS ON A SHOWER.
Yon. Butcher's ruby face is gleaming
With copious moisture, like the rain, .
Whose big drops, fast and frequent streaming,
Run races down the window-pane.
From pores cutaneous such effusion
In heat of business oft appears. .
That thought were now a fond illusion;
For ah, those cheeks are bathed in tears!
|News of the last great importatiºn
Of Yankee meat hath caught his eyes:
O'erwhelmed with grief and consternation
So now the blue-frocked Bobus cries.
From Commoners to Cads.
MR. PUNCH, if infallible, is yet not omni-
scient. Knowing that MR. JoHN DE MORGAN
had headed commoners in the destruction of
illegal enclosures on commons, he did not know
at the time that MR. DE Morgan was capable
of heading cads in an Orton demonstration of
tagrag and bobtail. But Mr. Punch never
pronounced MR. DE MoRGAN, er, cathedrá, to
be a wise and sensible man, or declared him,
authoritatively, actuated by any sentiment
superior to the enthusiasm of a demagogue
inflamed with a passion for notoriety.
That Terrible Turk.
AN assertion º passing current is
the saying that “the Turkis a Conservative.”
This however should be taken with grains of
salt fully amounting to a scruple. In Bul-
garia and elsewhere the Turk has abundantly
shown that, when his monkey is up, he can be
an out-and-out. Destructive. But, Conserva-
tive or Destructive, as the occasion of a threa-
tened European war, confound his politics!
Surred to A TEA.—“MISTER’’ DE MoRGAN

“TAKING THE LEAD.”
“For the last few months England has been taking the lead.”—MR.WARD-
HUNT, at Portsmouth.
“What was it we promised in that paragraph of the Protocol, which some
people have urged, but I think with signal ill-success, involves or implies the
idea of coercion? It was this: that if certain things were not done by the
Turkish Government—we being the judges of whether they were done or not
- then, at some future time, which was not fixed—we being theº: as to
when that time had arrived—we should consider with certain other Powers,
and say what we should then do.”—LoRD DERBY, in the House of Lords.
TARING the lead? Well, it’s flattering, very
To picture JoHN BULL in that masterful rôle.
But, perhaps, ere we make too much haste to be merry,
f were well of that lead to consider the goal.
Blind leaders have been, and we know where they guide to.
Adua such as DERby should better succeed.
Let him point out the fair winning-post we’re to ride to,
And show the result of our taking the lead.
Peace? No, not 1. for war-cries are rumbling,
And baffled diplomacy comes to a halt.
Treaty-rights? Those old bulwarks appear to be tumbling,
By gradual sap, if not daring assault.
Amelioration of down-trodden masses P
Qur help to that end has been trifling indeed.
What else? Well, the wreck of that poor Bridge of Asses
Remains as result of our—taking the lead.
And that? A: hits B. “Now,” says B., “I must mention,
My friend, that your manners are scarcely urbane,
d; if you evince any obvious intention—
That is, in my judgment—of punching again,
I fear I must really, at some time or other,
I won't fix the date to a decade or two, -
Take measures to—well, my annoyance to smother,
And consult as to what 'twere well, some day, to do.”
That's Protocol policy! “Safe?” Some may think so;
JoHN BULL has his doubts whether making it plain , .
That his pluck may at pinch from the sticking-place shrink so
Is certain to issue in ultimate gain.
At least, if his goal is this queer congregation
Of “Ifs,” that as peacemakers do not succeed,
He fails to perceive any special temptation
To jubilant bounce about—“Taking the Lead.”
THE CLOTH AND ERMINE.
GREAT and grievous disappointment was caused in the City by
the discontinuance of the custom wont hitherto from old time to be
annually and religiously observed by the Judges and Serjeants of
the Law on the first Sunday in Easter Term of going in state, arrayed
in full-bottomed wigs and ermine, to St. Paul's, “where,” as the
Echo says, “the Lond MAYOR, the LADY MAYOREss, the Sheriffs,
and the proper City officials, with sword and mace, and Aldermen
and Common Councillors, in fur and mazarine gowns, each with a
bouquet in his hand, waited patiently for the Judges and Serjeants
who did not come.” Ostensible excuses were made for this porten-
tous dereliction. But what if, º attitude assumed by
certain ecclesiastics towards the Public Worship Act and the Court
of Arches, the Sages of the Law thought proper to absent themselves
from Church in order to signify what they think of certain digni-

WE are informed (though we make this announcement sous toutes

desiring abatement of Income-Tax—“All the blanks in the Notice

the Italian libretti to which we are accustomed at the Opera, “how º thou art
mistaken! Ah Heaven! my divine enchantress (divina incantatrice), my words, are the
voice of truth!”. Then I spread out the Alphabet before her, and the Pig grunted at each
letter which made up her ſover's name. She parted with two roubles, and left us much
pleased with the entertainment. -
Wednesday.-Came up to Fort Number One. Found GENERAL KAUFFMANN here taking
care of Number One. Gave KAUFFMANN some lozenges for his voice. “Kauff, man, no
more,” said I, pleasantly, and he went into fits. I asked him if we should be stopped before
we got to Khiva. He answered with considerable caution, and put his finger to his nºse.
The last thing I saw of the old General was his left eye, as he winked at us through a

Never was so cold. I have a warm sack with a hot-air apparatus in which I live the greater
part of the day, and ride side-saddleways like a lady. . As in this climate one dare not show
one's eyes, or nose, or hands, I have ingeniously contrived holes through which the reins

he repeats this, I shall watch his play closely. e Sleigh-driver backed the Pig. I begin
to suspect collusion. How will this end? -
Day after-Came across a Vodki, which is a sort of Russian Punch-show, only without
Toby. It was being carried by its spirited proprietor, who complained bitterly of the decay of
the drama. The Vodki-man admired the É. and made an offer. Refused it, but played the
Vodki-man at écarté, with which he was not previously acquainted:—at least, so,he said;
but, for a novice, I never saw a man cut the * so often. Fortunately, as I explained to
him after he had won a dozen games, we were only playing for amusement—not for money

Found a mhoka (a Tartar donkey) and a

his neck, spelt out the words, “I’m a

The Vodki-man instantly released him,

For life has no abiding sting,

Too clingingly will care for.

Who makes a trade of jesting;
And only zanies spoil its zest

Creeds, Councils, Crowns, and Mitres.

can drink my-pot of strong beer of at a pull, let me implore you to exert your great.in-
fluence amongst the Equestrian Order for keeping the regulation of provender in their
stables strictly and steadily up to the mark, of good old English fare. As beef, mutton, and
yeal hold their place in the banqueting-hall, so let hay, beans, and corn in the manger.
This sentiment must commend itself to every stable º
But, esteemed Sir, there has appeared in several of your contemporaries a statement
representing a certain French gentleman—so to call him—a M. Le BIAN, to have inven
a substitute for oats. It seems to have answered so well in France, that innovators propose
to introduce it into this country. The fodder designed to supersede oats is—what do you
imagine? Fºr ?
Parsnips of all subjects of the Wegetable Kingdom! Roots! What next! Turnips,
I suppose-Swedes, mangold-wurzel, kohl-rabi, food for cattle, including THORLEY’s,
perhaps, or, oil-cake even, who knows?—materials for the growth of meat. It is easy to
see what all this points to. . No doubt, parsnips are highly nutritive, in their way.
Everybody knows that they contain a large quantity of sugar, wherewithal they served your
great-grandmothers to make snip-wine. But sugar is carbonaceous food, simply fat-
tening. It will not support the condition requisite for the hunting-field, or the turf. - It
will only qualify a creature for the stall.
Such as the jià ox, is, such will. it
render the superior quadruped-degrading
it to a stalled horse. Parsnips are recom-
mended in lieu of oats, mainly because
they are cheaper—four times as cheap as
oats. They are means by which horses ean
be fattened at small expense, like pigs.
Presently, perhaps, horses - be sup-
plied with wash; and education on pars-
º comprising an excursion upon acorns,
ill conclude with a brief course of barley-
meal.
The plain fact is, Mr. Punch, that if
given to horses, i of their proper
food, parsnips will be the thin end of the
wedge. In France the wedge has been
driven home. º has long pre-
vailed there; as, no doubt, anthropophagy
will very soon. Parsnips for British horses
will be the beginning of the end; and that
end will be the butcher's shop. In the
meanwhile you will have Horse Shows,
wherein the horses will be shown as fat
cattle. You will see horses, ere long, near
Christmas, exhibited amongst the rest of
the beasts at the Smithfield Club Cattle
Show, and graziers and meat-salesmen
coming and punching their sides. From the
knuckles of all such connoisseurs defend–
with your cudgel—the ribs of your humble
servant to command in any work according
to his capacity, Hot THNHNM.

TAXES IN RESERVE.
PUNCH hears that the following sugges-
tions for new taxation were struck out of
the Budget at the last moment. He would
suggest the substitution of them for the
Income-tax in a future year. -
A Tax on three-volume novels written by

(With the kind Permission of the Authorities.)
SMITH PASHA (a Captain in the 30th Hussars, Prince
Leopold's Own) is ºf northwards with a large
Turkish army. He is likely to be opposed, on reach-
ing Russian soil, by GENERAL Count SNooksRI,
another English officer on half-pay. ...
BRowN EFFENDI (of Her Majesty's Tin Tax Office)
has accepted the post of Director of War Telegraphs
to the Turkish Government. He will leave England
immediately (on long leave) to undertake the duties
of his new post. - -
M. THoMPsonoFF (of the British Foreign Office) has
been intrusted with the mission of stirring up an
insurrection on the borders of the Danube by the
Russian Government.
Jones EFFENDI (a Captain in the Royal Navy) is
in command of four Turkish Iron-clads. He has
been ordered to bombard Odessa. He has received
no instructions to spare British property in that
port.
CAPTAIN BRowNoFF (of the Royal Engineers, Chat-
ham) has * temporary service in the Russian
Army. He will be intrusted with the construction of
a road from Khiva to British India. It will be re-
membered that CAPTAIN BROWNoFF has recently re-
turned from service with his company in the North-
West Provinces. ---
RoBINsoN BEY (of the English Treasury) has ac-
cepted a contract from the Turkish Government to set
the Suez Canal on fire with torpedoes, powder, and

BEAUTIFICATION FOR BARNES COMMON.
THERE are actually, those who deprecate Railway extension on
Barnes Common I. Still more, Mr. Punch, will they object to the
improvement, designed for that º place by other and even
more tasteful parties than London and South-Western Railway
Directors,
Going towards Richmond by way of Hammersmith Bridge Road,
turn down the lane thence diverging at the “Red Lion” Pub. It
takes you out on the Common. You pass between meadows on the
right and left. The meadow close on the right has in it a rooker
among tall elm-trees. On the left the meadows are besprinkled an
... with daisies and buttercups and marsh-marigold and
cuckoo::flower; and as the season advances, and when haymaking is
at hand, the grass will have grown up luxuriantly, crested and
ted with red sorrel.
n this side, just where the lane opens on the Common, º to
your elbow stands a pole, displaying a red flag. A series of hike
8. and flags, a few yards apart, extends all the way up to the
metery. In the midst of them is hoisted a black board, º:
in white_letters, the enlivening legend, “Site of the Pro osed
Sewage-Manure Works.” Danger-signals these, apparently, hung
out. { absurdly alarmed Conservators.
Th site of the proposed Sewage-Manure Works is at present
upied by nothing prettier than furze richly out in bright yellow
blººm. Qh a hot sunny day, to be sure, blooming furze exhales a
delightful odour., Fancy that of the Works!
. A background to the site of the proposed Sewage-Manure Works
is formed of mere rows of trees §. in leaf. ould not
DR: JoHNSON have been right in saying that a grove of chimneys in
a place like that was better than any grove of º: ? Particularly

Bârnes Common with Sewage-Mäntire Works that they are princi-
§ certain parochial pigs of the Bumble description styed a
ortlake, where they have close by them an almost unfrequented
and quite out-of-the-way common in their immediate neighbour-
hood, between the road and Richmond Park, to build upon if they
must build Sewage-Manure Works upon a common rather than
expend enough money to have their sewers connected with a system
of main drainage.
Their foes also affirm that the project for the invasion and defile-
ment of Barnes Common, as they call it, is opposed by the people of
Barnes and Putney, and even by those of remote Kensington, very
naturally, they say; for, should it be executed, the next step, in
sanitary progress may be expected to be the erection of Sewage
Manure Works in Kensington Gardens. And why not?
I was greatly surprised, as no doubt, you will be, to hear that the
Barnes Common Improvement and Odorisation Scheme is likewise
opposed by the Metropolitan Board of Works. But its worthy
promoters are said to have prevailed so far as to have got a Govern-
#. Inspector appointed to report on the merits of their lovely
esign. -
Sound the alarm, Mr. Punch, summon all the right-minded
Members of Parliament, and arouse the Society for the Preservation
of Open Spaces with your most raucous roo-too-tool for a trumpet-
call to à public benefactors in the attempt to enrich Barnes
Common with a delight to the eye, and a pleasure to the organ

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
NY ARK'ſ (Lords, Monday, April 3), LoRD DERBY (as Call-Boy): “War Overture on,
my Lords!”. MR. LAYARD reports the flitting of the Russ corps diplomatique from
- Stamboul; ColoneL MANSFIELD, the arrival of the first Russian detachments at
sh \\ Bucharest. Exeunt words. Enter swords. -
** \\ The EARL of CARNARVON, most laborious, well-meaning, and clear-headed of
- Colonial Ministers, introduced his skeleton South African Confederation Bill. It
is the mºre framework of a permissive measure, under whose dead ribs the Colonial Legislatures may, if they will, breathe a soul, by
turning the Bill's “mays” into “shalls.”. The problem before the Colonial Office is not an easy one-how to combine into a harmonious,
well;guarded, and well-governed whole, the motley mixture of Dutch Settlements, English Colonies, and Native States now dividing
South Africa, in more senses than one... At present Dutch Boer, English Settler, Malay oolie, Tottie, Bechuana, Griqua, and Zulu, only
agree to differ. The Bill º: how, if they can but agree to try to agree, they are to go about it, all the ticklish points being left open for
local discussion and settlement. No doubt this is the best way of managing a most difficult job. If LoRD CARNARwon had sent out a
ready-made constitutional suit it would never have fitted. As it is, he empowers the Colonial tailors to take their own measures, and cut
their own coat of many colours according to their own cloth and the wearer's figure. -
. (Commons.)-A nice go in at the House's favourite game of question and answer. More outbreaks of Cattle Plague, worse luck, in
big suburban herds, too, at Willesden, Kensal Green, and Notting Hill. Nothing for it but stamping out. “That’s the sort of plague
I am!” Budget talk; CHILDERs and MUNDELLA croaking, W. H. SMITH sanguine, CHANCELLOR of THE ExchEQUER cheerful. . -
. . SCLATEB-Booth asked for a credit of Four Millions for Local Loans. CHAMBERLAIN congratulated the country on the increasing
indebtedness of local authorities. It meant expenditure on remunerative and much-needed works of drainage, gas, water, and street
improvement. Bar jobs and blunders, MR. CHAMBERLAIN–a biggish bar too. But it is the Local Government Board's business to knock
that bar down and keep it down. If only the Board could contrive to use a little less red-tape in the process!
Tuesday (Lords).--Lord DERby announced the crossing of the Roumanian frontier by 17,000 Russians at Bolgrad and Jassy.
LoRD GREY wanted to know whether what is called the D. T. Draft Protocol (in which Turkey undertakes to do that the
Conference asked, and to allow, the Ambassadors to overlook their doing it, if Russia will only take the armed hand off her throat);
was ever considered while the Asses' Bridge was building. LoRD, DERby said no doubt the D. T. Draft might represent the SULTAN's
idea, but it was never before the Asses'-Bridge-builders; and if it had been, he really did not believe it would have altered matters.

. (Commons.)—MR, SHAw moved for a Select Committee to inquire
into the nature, extent, and ſº of the demand made #. a large
Fº of the Irish people for the uncoupling of the Keltic cat
om the Saxon bull-dog. The night's division proved, as a fact,
what the mover began by admitting as a statement, that the con-
cession of Home-Rule is out of the pale of practical politics.
MR. KING - HARMAN seconded the Motion; MESSEs. BUTT, BLEN-
NERHASSET, O'SHAUGHNEssy, SIR Colm AN O'LoGHLEN, and SIR
W., LAwson, supported it; MR. C. LEwis, MR. W. Johnston,
and MR; BRGEN, for Irish constituencies, protested against it; the
Right Honble. W. E. FoESTER knocked it out of time; PROFEssoR
FAWCETT danced over it; LoRD HARTINGTON gave it a parting kick,
and finally, the House administered the coup de grâce to it by a
division of 417 to 67, of whom thirteen only were English Members.
In fact there was no need of a coup de grâce. The Motion was
still-born. MR. Q'DoNNELL, the Secretary of the Home-Rule Con-
federation, had killed it in #; by his letter to the Times, pro-
glaiming that the Irish vote, in English constituencies, would be given
“solid,” to the highest bidder, and that the Liberals must choose
between º; Home-Rule and exclusion from Öfice” iii
the crack of doom.’
As MESSRs. FoESTER and FAwcETT both gave the Home-Rulers
clearly to understand, the Liberal party would a thousand times rather
take their chance of exclusion for ever from the Government of a
United Kingdom, than their chance of a share in the government of
a divided one, by aid of the Home-Rule vote. In a word, the Par-
liament of the United Kingdom will not, help the agents of Irish
disaffection to take the muzzle from the Kilkenny cats, and set those
vicious and vindictive animals worrying each other in the ring of
a Palace Green Parliament-House, to the delight of cynics and
the shame of intelligent and civilised men.
If Home-Rule means merely Local Self-Government, it can be
given under that name. If it means Repeal of the Union—as it
does mean in the minds of its sincerest supporters—it cannot be
given at all. The sooner Ireland puts that into her dudeen, and
smokes it, the better for her. - - -
Tuesday's debate was chiefly valuable for the emphasis with which
it records that determination. We may thank M.R. O'DonnEIL's
letter for bringing the Home-Rule imposthume (our printer had
printed “imposthure”) to a head., To-night's talk quité discharged
it. Time and prosperity must be left to cure the ill-humours in the
Irish body politic.of which the itch for Home-Rule is a symptom.
SIR.M.Hicks-BEACH flung a little-needed new apple of rd into
the debate by charging MR. GLADSTonE with having written to recom-
mend MR. %. to the Liberal constituency of Salford, after, and
although, he had taken the Home-Rule shilling., SIR MICHAEL was
out in his dates. MR. GLADstone showed that his letter had been
written in MR. CAwley's lifetime, long before MR. KAY was a can-
didate for Salford even, much more before, he had made friends of
the solid Irish of that highly-Hibernianised constituency.
Wednesday.—MR. Hopwood moved the Second Reading of a Sum-
mary £ºſing: Bill, dealing with the subject-matter of a Govern-
ment Bill already before the House. Why cross CRoss? So the
House settled Hopwood by 228 to 164. -
Scotch Bill for doing away with Hypothec floored for the time
being by a quarter of an hour's severe operation of GREGORY's
Mixture of hard fact and hard law.
Thursday-Seven hours in the Lords over the DUKE of RICH-
Mond's Burials Bill—for aggravating the Dissenters' evance,
under the show of removing it. They want equality in the parish
churchyard. The Bill gives them toleration. They want their own
services over their dead. It gives them “silence.” Silence does not
imply Non-conformist consent—or content either; and IQRD GRAN-
VILLE became the mouth-piece of their non-content, in his Amend:
ment that in this matter no measure would be satisfactory which did

not leave friends and relatives free to use at burials in parish
churchyards such Christian and orderly observances as to them
might seem fit. -
o this complexion it must come; but bigotry and exclusiveness
die as hard as ever; and on Thursday they had a field-night; though
it is to be noted as a cheering sign of the times, and a proof that the
harvest-time of common sense and Christian charity are nigh, that
both Archbishops, in principle, and the BISHOP OFOXFORD by his
vote, supported LoRD GRAN VILLE's Resolution. There was a great
crowd. he Bishops overflowed their benches. There were old
ladies, besides those who were present virtute officit, young ladies,
intelligent foreigners (including the Christian Greek and the Hea-
then Chinee), a large muster of the Commons, and many eldest
sons of Peers—supporting, as is their right and duty, the Throne
on the steps thereof.
It was as much a matter of course that the Resolution should be
lost (141 to 102 was a small majority against it for the Peers) as it is
that it will be carried in due time. Do not the BISHOP OF LINCOLN
and the EARL of DARTMoUTH oppose it? Do not the MARQUIs of
SALISBURY and the Archbishops pray a settlement, ere an offer of
worse terms come with worse, i.e., better, times? But the Con-
servative Tarquin will not listen to the Šibyl, so her books are
withdrawn from sale, to reappear in due season, at the inevitable
higher figure which will have to be p. at last. The question is
not one to be laid at rest by a “silent burial.”
Commons.)—HoBART PASHA will cease to be HobART PASHA
R.N., from the outbreak of the War. ... There is no rupture of
Diplomatic relations between Russia and Great Britain.
n Committee on the University Bill, LoRD FRANCIs HERVEY moved
the wrath of GRANT DUFF and SIR JoBIN LUBBock by protesting
against Professors, and backing College education by Tutors against
niversity education by Lecturers. The Member for the Border
Burghs seconded him. Between Lord HERVEY, TREVELYAN and
Lowe on the Fellows' side, and GRANT DUFF and fºodſ on the
Professors’, SIR. W. HARcoURT took the mediatorial line, and Jove-
like weighed in equal scales the fates of Scholarship and Science,
Colleges and Universities, Fellows and Professors, Endowment
of Research, and Research of Endowments. At last the Bill
ot into Committee, and there was a fight over the names of the
mmissioners, Phofessor PRICE, PRofessor HUxLEY, PROFEssoR
MAX MüLLER, DR. BATESON and in Hooken being in turn set
up as Aunt Salleys, to be knocked down by majorities varying
from 10 to 32.
... The House adjourned at a quarter past one, much delighted with
its little game of three scientific-sticks a penny:
Friday (Lords).-A Railway. Accidents Commission has lately
reported, recommending measures for enforcing on the Companies
punctuality and safe speed of trains, reasonable hours of service,
and an effective block and brake system.
LoRD BURY moved a Resolution pledging my Lords not to do any-
thing to carry out these recommendations. Rest, rest, perturbed
spirit! The House is not going to. It was hardly necessary for
LoRD BEACONSFIELD to say as much. This is the merry month of
may, not must. A Government that won't join in coercing Turks
has no locus standi for coercing Directors. So far from its being
necessary for Lok D BURY:to raise the subject, my Lords are quite
ready to burke it first and bury it afterwards—with a “silent burial,”
of course; so the less said the better. Leave the Companies to provide
blocks and brakes, as they do now, in all senses of the words, on the
principle of undivided responsibility—tempered with damages.
(Commons.)—A talk to be taken into consideration by owners of
ships trading to Odessa, still more of sailors shipping on board
thereof. The Russians have given notice that if such ships get
among the torpedoes the crews are “to go below.” Nothing more
likely. It hardly needed a Russian notice to tell us that.
The House declines, by 189 to 65, to accede to THE O'Donoghue's
Motion, first for a Resolution pledging the House to take further
steps to turn the Irish tenant into a fixture, and the Landlord into
a rent-charger, and if the House won't grant that, for a Royal Com-
mission to inquire into the matter. The House declines to follow the
Home-Rulers rule, of fooling Irish tenants to the top of their bent.
Parliament does not mean to grant fixity of tenure any more than
Home-Rule, and prefers to say so in plain majorities, let BUTT pipe
never so persuasively.

to the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN and the Home SECRETARY that
have any doubt as to not only the perfect safety but even the plea-
surableness of ZAZEL's sensational performances, they had better

ago by MR. Disraeli, when we were sitting in Qpposition, in the presence of

remarkable powers of speech. R. DisrAELI, on that occasion, said to me,

A PROBLEM.

A REIN PAST BEARING.
OUR valuable" . the British Medical Journal has
lately uttered a seasonable reminder to its professional readers (to
which Punch is glad to give publicity beyond the professional #: e)
of the cruelty of bearing-reins, Punch's protests against which,
from FLOWER, have, Punch is glad to see, borne already abundant
fruit—and will yet bear more. Punch quotes from the journal
in question:-
“We are reminded, by the recommencement of the season in London, to
say a few words by way of directing attention afresh to the powerful and
humane pleas of MR. Fioweb against the cruel practice of driving horses
with bearing-reins. It is a pleasure to notice that by far the larger number
of the leading medical practitioners in London have discontinued altogether
the use of bearing-reins; and we hope that the day is not far distant when we
shall be able to point to the equipage of every medical practitioner in the
country as a practical protest against the use of this most unnecessary,
painful, and mischievous appendage to driving-reins. Physiology protests
against the strained and artificial attitude which the horse is compelled to
assume, and which must certainly lessen his power of drawing weights.
Humanity and common sense protest against the infliction of this constant
gagging strain upon the sensitive mouth of an animal whose mouth is used
by the driver as the principal means of guiding and directing him. Nor can
any ene who has any real knowledge of or pleasure in the study of animal
forms feel otherwise than gratified at the free and unconstrained attitude of
a horse driven without bearing-reins. Their use is a mere matter of senseless
fashion. No good coachman uses bearing-reins for a horse from which he
desires to get the full amount of work, or which he desires to leave at ease.
Their employment is, indeed, merely a senseless fashion, which has abso-
lutely nothing to recommend it; and in favour of abolition there are reasons
so many and decided that we hope that not many years will pass before they
are not only disused but forgotten. The members of the medical profession
owe much to horses, and they can so well appreciate the reasons for disusing
bearing-reins, that we may fairly look to them to set an universal good
example in this matter. And now that London is filling with fashionable
º: whose horses are much disfigured by this cruel instrument of torture,
we hope that before the season is over we may be able, in directing attention
to this subject, to say no medical man in London uses bearing-reins for the
horses which he drives.”
Can it be true, by the way, as Punch has heard, that BARONEss
BURDETT CogITs allows the use of bearing-reins on her carriage-
horses?. If it, be, let our sweet ANGELA, in her character of the
animals' friend, just trouble herself to investigate the matter. Let
the Angel take counsel of the Flower—and we will answer for her
abolishing the gag forthwith—not coſite qui coite—for it will cost
nothing to do it away, though it costs poor horses more sufferinº
than her kind heart knows, to bear it.
And can another strange story Punch hears be true—that the
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has shrunk from any
manifesto against bearing-reins, through fear of ºf wealthy
sºnable subscribers who like to see their horses hold their
eads up

PEACE, with her olive-branch dust-stained and torn,
In sad and hopeless silence sat forlorn.
Storm raged around, but on each wind there came
Tumultuous invocation of her name. -
“Peace! Peace!” the echoes answered. Peace upraised
Her sad, sweet eyes. The maddening tumult'mazed
Their clear regard. Red Murder, with his hand
Clenghed in fierce strain upon a blood-dyed brand,
Howled for her aid; Ambition, with his hordes
Massed in dense myriads for the feast of swords,
Uplifted solemn 3. as who should love
The Lady of the Olive-branch and Dove;
Hypocrisy, the Cross clasped to her breast,
And armies at her heels, with unctuous zest
Lipped the loved name; and sleek Diplomacy
Even in Peace's name gave Peace the lie.
Grey wolfish rancours of race, creed, and hate,
Eager to cool in blood their hot debate,
Drew over their wolves' backs the sheep's disguise,
And masked their wrath with fair philanthropies.
Poor Peace! Perturbed, perplext, she fain would ask
Why all invoke her help, and to what task
They'd call her hands. She looked around. The skies
Sud # darkened. Ere those .# cries
Had died upon the wind, War's naked blade
Flashed lightning-like athwart the deepening shade.
Diplomacy, its formal protests hushed,
Skulked from the scene, with torn waste-papers crushed
In shaking hands; and, panoplied in pride-
The wolf revealed, sheep's clothing cast aside—
Two champions stood forth, stern face to face,
Hot for the red arbitrament; the Mace,
Poised menacing, the Scimitar, at guard;
Strong sinews strung, against wrist quick to ward,
Bear-crested, broad, the stark mace-wielder towered;
Lean, lissom as the pard, with brow that lowered,
And eye that quailed not, crouched his Moslem foe.
Trial by battle Who the end may know?
Who tell what warriors more may join the fray ?
Or who the º: strife can hope to stay ?
Peace pressed her fluttered dove to her pale breast,
And with one wistful look towards the West, -
One low-breathed prayer of “Heaven defend the right!”
Athwart the deepening darkness took her flight.
Destination of Donkeys.
THERE are persons who must have seen many dead Donkeys.
They reside in the country, where they carry on a manufacture.
At an inguiry held the other day under the Artisans' Dwellings
Act, a - YWARD, a young costermonger, was examined.
Incidentally—
“He said:—"We deal in the provision line, bacon and cheese. We sell
our donkeys in the winter at the Cattle Market. We don't know what they
do with them.’ He assented to MR. Rodwell's insidious suggestion that at
that time sausages come up from the country.”
Perhaps it is rather the case that the Donkeys go down to the
country at that time, and the sausages come up soon after.

A CITY Article in the Times contains the remarkable, not to say
startling, announcement that “the 19th number has just been pub-

“CURSED BE HE WHO MOVES MY BONES.”
THE Bunhill Fields' Burial Ground, in which are laid
the bodies of GEORGE Fox and JoHN BUNYAN, has lately
been the cause of much controversy. Miss Octavia HILL
has offered to the Committee of Friends, in whose hands
the matter lies, almost any sum for the possession of the
land, that it might be made into a garden for the
wretched and over-crowded population of district.
The Committee of Friends, however,º: sell the
land for building sites, caring littleth º that purpose
the bodies of thousands have to be removed. eye-wit-
ness of the modus operandi says:—
“Under the direction of a ‘careful undertaker” (who, how-
eyer, was not present at the time), the remains of some 5,000
of the dead were being disinterred.”
Those who had lain side by side for two centuries
were now separated, and the bones of the young and old
were placed together in coarse deal boxes, and rein-
terred in a large hole at the other end of the ground.
Many of them, whilst awaiting this fresh burial, were
piled in a rude heap in a corner, and the fumes of the
carbolic acid which had been poured over them testified
tº the care extended to the living by the disturbers of
the dead. The bones were only separated by severeill-
usage; and the ribald language of the workmen who
undertook the task, when added to the method of the
work, was such as to justify the term, “Raised in Dis-
honour.”

(In the Rhonddha Valley.)
TEN º: far down, those five drew painful breath,
And heard, at last, their strokes that hewed a way
Through the black wall: a race 'twixt strength and death:
Hunger and Water waiting for their prey.
Teil days, above, that valley poured its life,
ſen, women, children, round that sudden grave,
To watch, with heart-sick hope, the stubborn strife
Betwixt men's power to bear, men's power to save.
Ten days, wide England through, the nation's heart
Hung on the struggle, with one pulse, one breath,
Answering the wires, which toid the yards that part

Great strife in little space was theirs to wage:
hat black wall their least foe; with poisonous flame,

Still rising, as salvation nearer came.

As inch by inch the cruel waters crept;
e other side, strong arms the§ that sway
In face of many deaths—till forth there leapt
The shout of victory, for life and strength
Had been too mºth for death: the five were won
From famine, water, fire, and diasped at length,
Their savers' helping hands—the fight was done!
And England's heart from common sympathy
Broke forth in common burst of thankful prayer;
And from the cottage to the throne, one cr
Went up, “Well done!” as England been there.
And she was there: the Lady of the Land -
Had with her people watched that ten days' fight:
Her eager voice of question crossed the i.
That bore those wasted sufferers back to light.
Oh! well for them that suffered, them that saved,
Her that rewarded with a rich reward:

Let us remember the brave eight that came
With life in hand, one eight out of a throng—
But of a throng that more such eights had found,
Had these been stricken down. God bless them all!
Such proofs of brotherhood may not abound,
But, when need comes, long may such proofs befall!
And long may England feel the trust in Heaven
That nerved those sufferers' hearts, those savers' hands;
Trust that to England's millions was given,
To prompt the thanksgiving that faith commands.

DIARY OF MY RIDE TO KHIVA.
(Continued by Private Wire" as before.)
Exr Day.-Up all night with
Pig, teaching him something
new, MASKELYNE AND CookE
would do good business out
here with Psycho and a
sleigh. Many a snow-
farmer in these regions
would be glad of Psycho for
an evening's amusement,
and would pay high for the
entertainment. Piggy nearly
as good as Psycho, only not
so dependable. The advan-
tage of my Pig over Psycho
is that no machinery is
required. This is a hint to
MESSRs. M. AND C. But I
won't say another word if–
Need I add a condition to
men of such business-like
habits as MESSRs. M. AND C.
If I know the secret of
sycho, what am I worth?
I am sure that my friends,
M.AND.C., at a distance,
will, after this intimation
at once add their honoure
and valuable names to the
list of subscribers by whose
assistance I am to be kept
out, here. When I return,
I shall, with my Fif my

Boy, *. Mechanical Piano, and perhaps a Fair Circassian or two (some-
thing like the lady with long hair on MRs. ALLEN's wall advertisement—
only much more so), have such a Show for the Egyptian Hall as will
astonish all, London: My Entertainment will be announced as “My Ride

with a note, saying that, as he couldn't ride, and as he shouldº be
sued by me for eighteenpence an hour (as he infallibly woul have been

the Pig at écarté (he won four games out of five to-night, so I shall begin to
teach him something else, because my Sleigh-driver and his Boy always back
the Pig now, and I lost more than a rouble and a half-odd!), when, accidentally, I whistled the favourite movement from the Overture
to the Cheval de Bronze. In a second, my steed had broken from its º and was cantering round and round in exact time to the
tune. Struck with the coincidence, I put on the steam, and went presto-so d the animal,—prestissimo—so did the animal; while the
Pig sat up on his tail, which doubled under him, and grinned from ear to ear (just as you’ve seen the mouth of the boar's head at
Christmas time with an apple, or a lemon, in it), and the Sleigh-driver and Boy applauded violently. Prestissimo-issimo—"again he
urges on his wild career;” and as I repeated this most happi { applicable line to myself, a º happy thought—if I may be
rmitted to use the expression—struck me... “Am I not in the very region of the Scenes of the Circle P Am I not in the country of
azeppa f" Then the idea formulated itself into poetry, and, like an inspired Vates of old, I exclaimed—
“'Tis the spot for bold Mazeppa,
There the Steppes, and here the Stepper!”
And then I stopped; inspiration, had reached its limits, and why should I force inspiration by suggesting to inspiration that the next
line ought to end with “Pepper,” and that “Leper” wouldn't be a bad termination for line four P. Ah! if poets only knew when to
halt, how many halting lines should we be annually spared! Why pump at a dry well? Why bring up the º water P Why not,
in fact, leave the Pierian well, alone?, “O Inspiration l’, as the Poet has feelingly ..". “O Inspiration I what crimes have not
been committed in thy name!” But to go into the subject of what crimes have not been committed, would be to wander away
from my present fixed intention, which is to write a Diary of my Ride to Khiva, and not a disquisition on Inspiration, the Divine
Afflatus, and burning the bellows. - -
Next Day.—Crossed the Qxus again, Slept well., Up, early, Horse out. Whistled Overture, and then tried fresh music on
Mechanical Piano, while the Pig turned the handle. Another of his increasingly numerous accomplishments., Horse up to a great

that he can dance a waltz, a polka, and, march in quick or slow time. I aimed at him with my umbrella (or somebody's which
came with me from England), and he fell flºº. (with much spontaneous humour) to be dead. We try to lift him. “No
good pulling at a dead horse,” I exclaimed (this will be part of my º: for my Entertainment—registered already), and then, after
asking him to get up to see his mother, then to have his dinner, and other, facetious, suggestions, I cried out, “Here’s a Policeman
coming!” whereupon he jumped up on to his all-fours, pulled himself together, the Pig, turned the handle of the Mechanical Piano,
which at once struck up the Bronze Horse, prestissimo et fortissimo, and away went the gallant steed round and round, with me clicking
the whip, and singing "Hi! hiſ Hooplaſtchk!”, while the Sleigh-driver and the Boy applauded to the echo. Fortune is before us.

entrepreneur commence. I wish we could get to Khiva. Note.—River again. Crossed the Oxus for the fourth time. How it

2:30.-Met a sign-post going the other way.
We’ve taken the wrong road again. Getting
nearer China; most provoking. here are we
now? The Fig, as a native, ought to know.
* * * * Have just put the letters of the Alphabet
before Pig, hoping he would spell out the name of
the locality, and give us further information
about our road to Khiva. Pig either obstinate,
stupid, or still in a sulky jealous pet about Horse.
All he would do was, first to spell out—“S-H-E
L-O-V-E-8 Y-O-U,” and then to grunt at the
Sleigh-driver, as if under the impression that he
was going through the ordinary performance, and
answering my º: “Who is the handsomest
man here?”—when he ought, by right, to select a
visitor. Pig no use. Sleigh-driver doesn’t know
eountry. He says, “O overfed and much-caressed
Son of distinguished Parents,”—this means me—
“there is a sheheenski nigh at hand, kept by a
brother of mine. Let us go thither, and inquire
our way.” Refused.
Saturday.—Crossed the Oxus. This is the fifth
time in three days that we’ve crossed the Oxus.
Either the river winds (I don't mean breezes, but
winds with a long poetic “i") considerably, or we
are travelling in a circle. Perhaps we are; if so,

up as an Irishman, but had not seen his country
for many years. More wickski. More tears. He
sang a sporting song, composed by himself,
about—
“”Tis on the Oxus
We hunt the foxus.”
But I forget the rest, except that it had a chorus
that sounded like “Shandygaff mavourneen!

Sunday.—Halt of the Caravan. Passed the morning in reading, the Pig and the
Sleigh-driver a series of touching discourses: first, on the sin of cheating at cards;
secondly, on the danger, of being found out; thirdly, on fidelity to employers;
fourthly, on gratitude to benefactors. After lunchski, taught the Pig some Sunday
games with the Alphabet, teaching him the answers to such questions as “Where was
Moses when the candle went out?” “Who took in the first sporting paper?” and
other queries from the Catechism... I fear that the Sleigh-man has no fixed principles.

DIARY OF A TURKISH SAILOR.
MovdA P.-Read the London papers. Drilled my men at the
Armstrong gun. Went to lunch whilst they were praying to the
Prophet, and spent the rest of the day in writing a long letter (upon
“Turkish Wrongs”), intended for insertion in the Times.
Tuesday.-Put on my Pasha's dress, and ordered some “Bass” to
be sent on board immediately. Communicated with the Admiralty,
Whitehall. Granted permission to my First Lieutenant to visit his
harem, and employed the rest of my time in composing a letter
(upon “Russian Atrocities”), intended for insertion in the Times.
Wednesday.—Wore my Admiral's uniform. Hoisted the Turkish
flag at the mizen, and returned shots with forty Russian forts. In
the intervals of the actions thought out a letter (upon “The
Honour of Turkey”), intended for insertion in the Times.
Thursday.—Read the Life of Nelson. Took breakfast whilst my
crew were at their devotions, and then blazed away at the Russians
until all was blue. After dark, wrote by the light of the exploding
shells a letter (upon “The Disgrace of Russia”), intended for inser-
tion in the Times.
Friday-Fired a salute in honour of the SUITAN, put on a new
fez and a pair of English shooting-boots. Smoked a few cigarettes
through my favourite hookah. In the evening gave chase to the
Russian Fleet, and jotted down a few notes (upon “Turkish Pros-
erity and Industry, with Lives of the Turkish Saints”), intended
or insertion in the Times. -
Saturday.—Put on my shooting-jacket and Scotch cap; , sang
“Rule Britannia” and a Turkish song of my own composition;
read Punch, and blew the Russian fleet to atoms. Made a speech
to my gallant crew about “shivering timbers” and “behaving like
true British Tars,” and substituted grog for sherbet. In the evening
wrote along letter (upon “The Turco-Russian War and the neutrality

Since first I saw her rapid dart
Across the diaper'd Velarium.

As graceful as a young gazelle,
With raven hair, and ruby dress,

Now, far above me, pretty dear,

Now wires all along “No fear!”—
A message wond'ring crowds repeat.
Now diving from the high trapézé

Two fairy wings one's fancy sees
*Sprout from the shoulders of Zazel.
Like swallow swiftly starting South,
She safely skimmed the air, and yet

Would jump, as she did in the net.
But see, she rises like a partridge—
And now becomes a true live shell,

taken to describe defective drains and sewers in com-

who eatches the fever ?. He catches it, generally, mark
you, not in, nor by, but for want of a trap."
PHYSIOLOGY FROM EDINBURGH!
To the names of men illustrious for their attainments in medical
science, and connected with Fdinburgh, will probably soon be added
the name of Auld Reekie's present º MR. M'LAREN.
In his place, on his legs, advocating the Cruelty to Animals Bill,
the Hon. Gentleman is reported to have augmented Collective
Wisdom by the information that
“It was said that if Vivisection were stopped, scientific growth would be
stopped; but the fact was that nothing remained to be discovered by Wivisec-
tion; everything had been discovered long ago, and experiments were now
made upon living animals, not for the F. of discovery, but for the purpose
of proving to students that certain things which they had been taught were
true.”
All this will be news to the medical profession. The most
advanced of known, Physiologists will perhaps be the most
surprised to learn that nothing, remains to be discovered by
Wivisection, and that everything has been discovered long ago;
which latter statement must also astonish some anti-Vivisectionists
who declare that no discovery has been ever made by Wivisection at
all. The more that known Physiologists know of the science they
cultivate, the more clearly they think they see how much remains
to be known, and the extent of their own ignorance. But the Hon.
Member for Edinburgh is at present an unknown Physiologist;
though, from the declaration above-quoted touching Physiology, he
appears to be in possession of all the knowledge it is possible to
acquire on that subject, which he will perhaps be sº good as shortly
to impart to the world in a volume which must shelve all the works
of Dr. CARPENTER.
Horticulture of Holy Russia.
WE are told, by telegram, that the Russians are planting torpe-
does in the Danube. This Russian gardening resembles, on a large
scale, that practised by our forefathers when they planted steel-
traps and spring-guns in their gardens. It is making the Danube a
bear-garden, which the bears insist on keeping all to themselves.

SIR John LUBBock will move the Previous

previous question. At times, dazed with talk
of the one topic, Punch begins to think there
never was a question before the Eastern, one
and is never going to be another. The Liber

Party (it seems just now to be party per pale-

an experimentalist on bees, but does not wish
at present to disturb, the hornet nest that
lurks in W. E. G.'s Resolutions. Evidently a

tactics, he cannot but admire the pluck of the
House's Hal o'the Wynd, who “fights for his
own hand,” and his own conscience. But he
repeats, if this battle was to have been fought
in the House, as it ought to have been, it
should have been fought in the first week of
the Session. In sofar as England is chargeable
with responsibility in respect of this war, Her
Majesty's Opposition has a right to share it
with Her Majesty's Government. “Inter arma

MR. MARTHUR brought up the awkward question of the Ceylon
Church Endowment—in which sweet little isle of our own, we tax
some two million and a half Buddhists and miscellaneous heathens,
to the tune of some £14,000 a-year, towards the º: of a Church of
Fºliº Bishop and Clergy or the few hundre Anglicans in the
Island.
Ceylon, it is well known, is a pre-eminently spicy island; but
this is a spicier state of things, we should think, for Liberationists
wanting a fat grievance against the Establishment, than for
the true friends of the Church as by law established. The sooner it is
the Church by law disestablished in Ceylon, the better. And so the
House evidently thought when, in the teeth of MR. LowTHER's plea
admisericordiam, it divided 147 for Church and Status quo, to 121
for things as they ought to be.
The Irish Land Act of 1870 contained provisions to facilitate the
purchase of their holdings by tenants. MR. SHAw-LEFEVRE says
these clauses have been a is: letter, and proposes a Select Com-
mittee to sit on the corpse—to “wake” it, in fact, as a dacent Irish
corpse should be, if it can be, waked; and if not, to buryit “clane out.”
MR. BUTT ingenuously confessed, that Irish tenants, as a rule,
preferred fixity of tenure to purchase of their farms. Sure, don't
they know when they’re well off? D'ye think they’d be fools
enough to be steppin’ into landlords' brogues, when tinants’ is such
a dale asier walkin'?
MR.CRoss moved a Bill to authorise four new Bishoprics to be
carved—Liverpool, out of Chester; Halifax, or Wakefield, out of
Ripon; Derby or Nottingham, out of Lincoln, and Íichfield ; and
Northumberland, out of ham. Methinks Punch has a vision of
the Church as juiº, with her º Episcopate for her Romeo,
invoking CRoss to “ fake him and cut him into little sees l’ What

MR. WHALLEY, who had a Motion in favour of hearing DE MoRGAN
at the bar—of the House, missed his tip through not being in his
place for once. He just arrived in time to be too late, to the great
relief of the House.
A tremendous Irish row over the appointment of the Select Com-
mittee on Cattle Plague and the importation of live stock. It was
proposed to add three Irish Members—MR. FRENCH, MR. MooRE, and
Mr. King HARMAN. The Home Rulers wanted Bragan, and the
House decidedly objecting, the Major “tuk, the flure,” and the
ruction, was kept up till two in the morning, the Scotch and
Welsh Members joining in at last, till the discussion wound up with
a general trailing of coats and a flourishing of shillelaghs. In fact,
it strikes Punch as very like what may be expected as the realisation
of Irish ideas, if ever there is a Home-Rule Parliament to the fore.
Wednesday.—MR. Holt moved his Bill for Absolute Prohibition
of Vivisection. The House—whose common sense recognises the
need of Wivisection, as well as the need of regulating it—showed
; jºin of the falsehood of extremes by rejecting the Bill
y 222 to 83.
MR. Osbohn E. MoRGAN buried his Burials Bill, with the intention
however, of a resurrection of its principle—the right of Noncon-

Thursday.-MR. O'CLERY gave notice of a tu quoque Amendment

LoRD ELCHO of an Amendment condemning coercion of the Turk, and
suggesting war on the Russian. The one silly, the other suicidal.
; Government means to protect the Suez Canal-I believe you,
my boy!—but in answer to anxious inquiries from Sunderland, de-
clines to ask the belligerents for fuller definition of contraband of war
—lest that elastic word should be made not only to “carry coals,”
like Gregory in Romeo and Juliet, but no one knows what articles
besides. In fact what may not be plausibly construed contraband
of war now-a-days, from cotton-twist to saw-dust?

the compact union of their forces and the strength of Her Majesty's Government's majority, they will give
themselves the pleasure of showing up the disunion and weakness of Her Majesty's Opposition, by leaving
their opponents to fight it out among themselves over the Gladstonian Resolutions, §. merit to them
for not taking, “a direct issue.” As if there were “a direct issue” out of the impasse Government,
Opposition, and Public Opinion have all got into on this Eastern Question! But the country, Punch is
glad to see; is waking to the importance at this crisis of showing that it is with Mr. GLApstone, not
with LoRD BEAconsfield, as the Daily Telegraph and Pall Mall Gazette do vainly assert.
The House sat as the Great Court of Appeal and Inquiry in small matters as great ones, on a long and

my thanks for the facilities
which were not afforded me by

seeing their works while still
on the easel. I did see them,
but how, no one will be more
surprised to learn than the

energy of myself and the
young man who accompanied
me as etcher, could have
triumphed over the apparently
insuperable obstacles. . .

this conduct to the peculiar

in MR. PETTIE’s “ Hunted Down" (No. 28); while MR. Gow's
“ Tumult in the House of Commons” would be literally nothing

at a distance will recognise my legs as completing the full-length

functions, it may interest the Public to know, are indicated by their
names, which guided the choice of the Academy Council. SI; John
GILBERT-well, his name alone is good enough for anything, and has
only to be mentioned to be received with acclamation. He will
excuse us if we treat him as he has, so often and so admirably
treated others, that is “cavalierly,” and, oddsfish, leave the doughty
knight, and so pass on... .
. Poynter's office is evidently that of Indicator, to the Hangers,
of what pictures should be condemned.
MR. G. D. LESLIE represents fair play—for where there is the
more truth and honesty, there must be the less-lie.
MR. A. ELMQRE is the champion of space.,. He would give each
Artist plenty of room. Give him an inch, and he asks for an ellmore.
MR. J. C. Hook—cela va sans dire—there can be no hanging with-
out a Hook. .
There are in the Academy, several Artists who richly deserye

have narrowly escaped the fate which their works, had justl

hands of a master like MR. FRITH, we are compelled to admit that
in the whole collection there is nothing like it, for it is like nothing
that we can call to mind. There is in the work an utter absence of
all mannerism. MR. FRITH can manage a crowd on canvas as
well as a police-sergeant can in the streets; and yet here, where
there was such a temptation to sacrifice the general, effect to
some startling individualities, we search in vain to detect any
straining at obtaining a temporary success by some theatrical coup

we are bound in justice to pronounce the picture as beyond

spicuous by his absence (and absence makes the Art grow fonder),
and so we take leave of MR. W. P. FRITH, and thank him—for
nothing.

who attacks the Crescent attacks the Moon! Mind that; and tell the

THE names of †. and subordinate benevolence appear oddly
associated in the following extract from American business news:-

arms from the Providence Tool Company within the past two years, under a
contract made with that Company tofurnish 500,000 Peabodyguns—a breech-
loading rifle similar to the Martini-Henry.”
In connection with the manufacture and sale of such instruments
for the welfare and happiness of mankind as stands of arms and
breech-loading rifles, how pretty to find the names of Providence
and Peabody!

Raised in the name of Justice and Humanity,
When Britons ought to rise and ride the storm–
It's reg’lar right-down, staring, stark insanity.
GLADSTONE's a–well, perhaps it won't quite do
To call him nasty names—that is, directly;-
'Tis best, when one is rearing idols new,
To burn the old ones very circumspectly.
But when a Leader goes and takes a whim
To raise no end of sentimental racket
At awkward times, the proper coat for him,
I holds, is a political strait-jacket.
There never was before a black bad lot
So bad and black as that there Northern Bruin;
Which all he says is simply lying rot,
And all he does designs our utter ruin:
His piety is all a sly pretence—
How unlike ours!—his talk of lies a tissue;
His interests, hang the creature's impudence,
To mention them when England's are at issue!
We must maintain our rights at any cost;
Our self-regard must know no party schism,
Thºugh truth be trampled on and honour lost—
Ah! that’s what BErsy calls true patriotism!
Justice, Humanity, may take their turn,
When Peace comes back again and conflict closes.
Meanwhile for battle all brave patriots burn,
And valorous BETSY as Bellona poses.
Look always on the Surrey Side.
Tolſ and Jerry. The dish now being served up to the public at
about 9°15 every evening, with sauce hollandaise at the Surrey
Theatre, is well worth the public attention, if only as a curiosity. The
old Temple Bar “set,” and the “set-to” in Tom CRIBB's pºlou: will
well repay a visit. Tom and Jerry was our Grandfathers' Our Boys.

To-morrow’ll be the tryingest

For I’m to the May, Mother, I’m to be queen ºthe May.

For the wind is still in the East, Mother, and makes one peak and pine:
And we’re going to have six weeks of it, or so the º: say---
And I’m to be Queen o' the May, Mother, I’m to be Queen o’ the May.
Isleep so sound all night, Mother, I'm sure I shall never wake,
So you’d better callime loud, Mºhºr, and perhaps you’ll have to shake:
I shall want some coffee hot and strong, before I’m called º

The East wind blows and blows, Mother, on my nose I follow suit,
For my influenza’s so very bad, and I’ve got a cough to boot;

MAY-DAY AT THE GOG-MAGOG.S.
WE have learnt from the ubiquitous Reporter how
May-Day was spent at Oxford, but, somehow or other,
the ceremonies connected with that Spring festivity at
Cambridge have not been recorded by a prying Press.
Mr. Punch would not like one University to be a-head
of the other, after the dead-heat his own prophecies
brought about on the river. He has therefore much
pleasure in assuring the public that the May-morning
rites of Cam were this year not a bit behind those of Isis.
The Squire Bedells woke the Undergrads at 4:30 by
sound of trumpet accompanied by the clang of their silver
pokers and the barking of their bulldogs. Amid the sup-
pressed anathemas of the Dons, who preferred snoozing
to spooning, the sons of Trinity issued forth attired in
various-coloured, paper and tinsel, adorned with leaves
and flowers, and preceded by their honoured Master,
who, º ised in a large green extinguisher
surmounted by a crown of roses (best paper), was easily
recognised by his classical capers and inaudible quota-
tions from HoRACE. After º: the tour of the town,
collecting additions to their procession, and an abun-
dant harvest of halfpence for their decayed Fellows, the
mummers repaired to the foot of the Gogmagog Hills,
where the fair Students from Girton were assembled to
select a Queen from among their number.
After a most amusing lecture on Wivisection, painlessly
illustrated, with the aid of chloroform, on the lambs
which formed a chief feature of the 5. an elegant
divertissement was performed by the gyps who had ac-
companied their Masters, to an obbligato accompaniment
of marrowbones and cleavers. -
Having seen term divide, a repetition of which favourite
entertainment is allowed on this day only, the happy
Mayers, preceded by their Queen, proceeded to five
o'clock tea at Girton, and the day's delights terminated
with a classical contest in the º: of Latin verses
between the champions of the Undergraduates and the
Ladies of the May. All the Lady Students were dressed in
costumes of the date of QUEEN ANNE, advanced aesthetics
being the order of the day.
THE WAGNER FESTIVAL,
(From Our Own Wagnerite who went to Bayreuth.)
HERE WAGNER has arrived. That's all I can say
at present. He has come for the Music of the Future
(I am, writing this on-Saturday, and next Monday is
his commencement—of which more anon) in London.
The great Art-Music-Poet says there's one fiddler short
I don't mean one short fiddler—it's not a question of
height) in his orchestra. I have volunteered, and the
Master Musical-Mind has accepted. My fiddle is a
dummy—but what matters? There must be two hundred
in the orchestra, and I am the two hundredth. On
Monday I shall be in my place, and expect from me a
clear, learned, and concise report of the proceedings of
º: and much esteemed friend (albeit he's what they
in the Low Hanoverian dialect a Sleibootzè), the
Wobbling WAGNER.
Need I sign myself, yours truly,
ALBERT HALL.
*** Any friends of yours wishing to be present with-
out paying, need only mention my name at the door.
That will be quite enough.
PECCAWII
PUNCH hassinned! He has done grievous wrong to one
he honours more than any woman in the world-after
the QUEEN and his own Judy—the BARoNEssBURDETT-
Coutts. He accused her of tolerating bearing-reins
on her garriage-horses. Since he penned the paragraph
he has learnt that some two years ago she refused longer
to tolerate bearing-reins, and parted with a stubborn
though otherwise valuable coachman, who refused, with
a not uncommon prejudice of his class, to, drive her
horses without them. He learns, too, that the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is now again,
as energetically as it can, ing up the cruelty of the
bearing-rein. Punch, misinformed in the case of both
; Baroness and the Society, hereby offers an apology to

Q..I believe, that you are perfectly mad upon the subject of
drawing-room decorations?
A: I am perfectly mad upon the subject, and my insanity extends
to dining-rooms, libraries, and sitting-rooms generally,
How, in your opinion, ought a drawing-room to be decorated P
4. On aesthetic principles. -
Q. What do you mean by aestheticP. ?
A. It is a wide term, but I think I may say that the outcome of
aestheticism is a mixture of antique quaintness, dingy and washed-
out colour, and oddity combined with discomfort.
Q. I believe you are in favour of latticed windows glazed with
opaque glass?
A. I am. The lattices you refer to were abolished years and years
ago, to make room for sashed windows admitting more light. The
opaque glass is conducive to darkness, a great desideratum in nine-
teenth century drawing-rooms. "
Q. I understand that you are in favour of curtains with grotesque
patterns, sage-green or dull-yellow for walls, and black furniture?
A. I am. It is very necessary that a feeling of melancholy should
be produced in a modern sitting-room, and I know of no better
means to create this mood than those to which you have alluded.
Moreover, it is proper to add, that the chairs should be of the most
uncomfortable character possible, cumbered with cushions warranted
to slip down on the floor on the smallest provocation.
Q. I think you do not recommend carpets?
A. Certainly not. Carpets are suggestive of comfort, and there
yon are at once in contradiction with aesthetic principles. I much
prefer straw matting, which is bitterly cold in winter and horribly
stuffy in summer. - -
Q. Would you permit rugs in the drawing-room?
4. Certainly. But I should insist upon their being of the most

A. Only E. H. Jones's, or an occasional nocturne of, WHISTLER's.
As a rule, I prefer plates stuck against the walls. - -
Q. In fact, you would decorate the walls of a drawing-room as if
you were dealing with a kitchen P -
A. Certainly; except that I would have more plates in the
drawing-room than are usually found in a kitchen.
Q. Would you permit tables in the room?
A. One. It'should, however, have only three legs, and should be
encouraged (by its construction) to topple over on every conceivable
opportunity.
Q. You have said nothing about the walls. - -
A. The lower part, or dado, should be covered with matting, and
the upper part be papered with a paper of sombre or sickly ground,

ugliest specimens of this pottery obtainable, Failing this, I would
fall back upon kitchen plates of the last century.
Q. You have said nothing about the comfort of the room.
A. As I have had the honour already to explain, I know nothing
about comfort. It is radically opposed to asthetic principles. .

THE PICK OF THE PICTURES.
(Being our own Handy-Book to the Exhibition of the Royal Academy.)
ANY of the Pictures appearing to me to be
misnamed, I have ventured either to
re-christen them, or to comment, very
briefly, on the ideas suggested by them,
without reference to the Official Cata-
logue. Let the Visitor take this guide
first, and then let him refer to the
Catalogue. Now to business.
No. 44. Man and horse in a Morass.
More ass he for being there. Clearly a
ood subject for MR. HoRSE-LEY, JUN.
#. man is evidently crying out for help,
and probably shouting hoarsely. Brayvo,
MR. HoRSLEY, JUN. I
No. 62. Another by the same rising
oung Artist. Coloured, Gentlemen at
F. on board ship, with the ship's Chaplain (a 8. in the midst of them. Perhaps
ANON LIDDON, or the EMPEROR of RUssrA, might bid for this picture. -
.No. 28. The Hunted Highlander. By J. PETTIE, R.A. There's only one name for this,
—it ought to be “ Half-Kilt.” - -
No. 67. The old Pump-Room, Bath. By G. A. STOREy, A. With views of the old Pumps
of both sexes. This tells its own Storey. -
No. 83. An Egyptian Feast. By E. Long, A. The Mummy at the feast reminds the
reveilers of their certain fate. The motto clearly should have been, “Ars Longa, vita
bretts.”. And a very fine specimen of the ars Longa, too. - - -i-
.No. 1% By J ". Hook, R.A. It illustrates the dialogue in the old story. “Gin, I
thinks,” “Whiskey, I hopes,” “Sea-water, by Jingo!” It should have been called “The
Bottle,” and dedicated to SIRWILFRID Lawson.
No. 182. By same Artist. “ The Boy at the Nore.”
No. 208. By R. ANSDELL, R.A. “Cave canes.” A
the canine inhabitants rising on the Lady of the Island.
No. 282. By A. ELMoRE, R.A. Without reference to the Qatalogue, you can see at once
that this is MARy, QUEEN, or Scots (here we are again!), tickling, somebody's (probably
DARNLEy's) littlefinger. And he doesn’t seem to like it. Title, “A Ticklish Situation.”
No. 210. By J. C. Hobsley, R.A. Kensington Gardens before the notice was up to the
effect that “No dogs are allowed unless led with a string.”
No. 216. By F. Goodall, R.A. Preparing for the Baby Show. -
No. 380. By J. C. Hook, R.A. Without referring to Catalogue, this appears to be a dog
}. out of a barley-field. On referring to Catalogue, I find that this is not the idea
intended to be conveyed. How could I have made such a mistake! -
No. 321. By Lioned SMYTHE. Probably a view of some sequestered spot in the grounds
of Colney Hatch. Foolish young person in foreground, damp grass, and fine prospect of
rheumatism in the back. - - - - -
No. 981. By JAMES ARCHER. Painful position of a Scotch Gentleman sitting for his
portrait in the open air. For the remainder of his life must he always sit in, this dress, in
this position, and in this identical spot for so many hours a day, or else will no one ever
recognise him Appalling thought!
No. 1263. By T. O. BARLow, A. “His Grace the DUKE of WESTMINstER, K.G.-after
J.E. MILLAIs, R.A.”. Is he?' I hope His Grace, K.G. will overtake J. E.M.ILLAIs, R.A.,
who must have had time to get out of sight while the Duke was putting his top-boots on,
as he is not in the picture.
No. 276. By the same. “Gloria.”. After John PHILLIP. And glory to T. O. BABIow, says
Punch, for this noble aving of his lamented friend's stirring picture of a Španish Wake.
No. 1363. By D. Without reference to Catalogue, I should imagine
rebellion in the Isle of Dogs, with
. WYNFIELD.
that this is some one in the Past listening to
the Music of the Future, and naturally much
irritated by it. A solo on the Jews' harp.
No. 1466. Striking Sculpture. By F.
LEIGHTON, R.A. May represent morning
exercise for a muscular person after tub-
time. Legend—“See what I found in my
bath this morning l’”
Now take a stroll back again, and, before
leaving for the day, look at-
No. 197. By E. M. WARD, R.A. “What
has he got in his head?” But this wasn't
what the Artist had in his head when he
painted this picture. Refer to Catalogue.
No. 508. Also by E. M. WARD, R.A.
After-dinner spasm. The momentous ques-
tion, “Was it the Cucumber?” Poor dear
creature |
No. 409. By J. E. MILLAIs, R.A. Gen-
tleman going away with his portmanteau.
On the point of departure his mind misgives
him, and he sternly asks his wife, "Are
you quite sure you packed up my sponge?”
She replies, º: in the affirmative.
So the picture is rightly called “Yes.”
TRY AGAIN.
“DRURy LANE GARDEN.—A correspondent
writes:– “Last week it was announced in The
Times that a burial-ground long since disused
in º Lane had been formally opened as a
garden by the Vicar and Churchwardens of the
parish of St. Giles, for the use of the surrounding
inhabitants. However, on the evening after the
opening, the 2nd instant, the Churchwardens went
down to see how the garden was appreciated, when
they witnessed such a scene of disorder, wanton
trampling on the ornamental grounds, and in some
instances tearing up of plants and shrubs, that
they gave immediate orders to have the garden
cleared and the gates closed until further notice.’”
- 77tes.
[Punch is glad, for the sake of the Drury Lane
population, to learn, by a letter from Miss
Octavia #III, that the damage was neither so
serious nor so wanton as is here stated.]
DiscouragiNg, that Drury's hordes un-

'Gainst Eden's influence their hearts
should harden.
Sad to see beds trod down, and shrubs

In this, the first “God’s-acre” ever given

Opposition Actaeon worried by his own pack; of those who were be-
hind the scenes, to see W. E. G., turned tactician, split his differences
and his Resolutions, in order to re-cement. Her Majesty's Opposition.
Let Punch remind the readers of the substance of these four now famous Resolutions. The first censured the Porte for not i.;
the authors of the Bulgarian atrocities at LoRD DERBY's bidding. The second declared that Turkey had forfeited all claims on the moral an
material support of England, until she mended her ways. e third º: us to the cause of self-government in the Turkish provinces.
The fourth committed us to the principle of a European concert to enforce Europe's will on Turkey, by coercion, if need be. -
Rather than support the two latter, SIR John É. had given notice to extinguish all four, under “the d: question.” The
debate on this would have brought into strong relief the antagonism between the more advanced Liberals of the Opposition, who were pre-
pared to support all four Resolutions, and the more moderate majority, who would have voted with SIR John, and so shelved the Resolu-
tions, without directly ºf...; them. One question between the sections of %. in the House, and out of it, hangs on the policy
of coercion. Another, and more important at this moment, lies between a º of strict neutrality and one of, or at least tending to, war.
Punch has always kept one line on the coercion question. Unless England meant to join in coercing Turkey into compliance with the
conclusions of a Conference, she should never have taken part in one that, without coercion, was sure to end in smoke. Let those who
may wish to consult our record, turn back to the Cartoon, in which, immediately on the conclusion of the Conference, Punch put to
the British Lion the crucial question, “If you didn't mean to backup LoRD SALISBURY, why did you send him P”
m. the moment that Her Majesty's Government proclaimed their J.; of non-coercion, the way was clear for Her Majesty's
Opposition to have proclaimed theirs of coercion, if they dared. They did not dare. Their ranks were from that moment divided into a
more cautious wing, under LoRD HARTINGTON, and amore thorough-going and daring wing, under MB. GLADSTONE and the Duke of ARqYEL.
The spectacle which the Majority promised themselves on Monday was the internecine combat of these two wings—the duel, of the

two, so that the Opposition might fight shoulder to shoulder in their
support.
unch won't say if this was a wise or unwise, a brave or
cowardly, policy. He would, as a rule, rather see quarrels fought
out than stifled., This is a quarrel, sooner or later to be fought out.
But whether it should be fought out by Her Majesty's Opposition for
the amusement of H. M. Government is another matter.
Naturally, the Majority considered themselves very ill-used in
being thus robbed of their anticipated entertainment.
The bolder spirits, who were willing to face this fight, in the strength
of their manly principle, “thorough,” found voice by CHAMBERLAIN
and CourTNEY to express their regret at the compromise. But if
their Leader consented to waive a vote on his third and fourth
Resolutions, he did not, happily for England and the House, waive
his speech in their su -
Thanks to them, we haye heard the boldest, most logical, and, as
Punch believes, in the long run, wisest and most clear-sighted
English ºn the Eastern Question propounded and maintained
in one of the most spirit-stirring speeches ever delivered in
the House of Commons. Never, on any question were parties, in or
out of the House, so divided as on this. Punch, finding all his
hopes for the future, all his convictions of duty in the present, all his
conclusions from history in the past, reflected in MR. GLADstone's
noble words, does not hesitate to avow himself—so far as he has a
personality—at one with the Member for Greenwich, and those who
É. along with him, in this crisis. He believes, if thoseviews had been
ldly and consistently maintained by the Government from the first,
war might have been averted, and the oppressed Rayahs would have
learnt e'er this that they had as staunch and stout afriend in the Lion
as in the Bear, not to say a safer and more magnanimous defender.
But the opportunity has been allowed to pass. Another influence
(a veiled force that has been working from the first) has been allowed
to prevail; an influence in all points tending to condonation of
Turkey and to distrust of Russia; an influence that seems to have
for its object to set the Lion and Bear by the ears, and to exaggerate
the danger tº Englishinterests in Asia and Européfrom Russia's hos-
tilities with Turkey; an influence that has been allowing the Ship of
State to drift, if not piloting her, nearer and nearer the Maëlström
of War—of war, if not avowedly for Turkey, at least against Russia
as the enemy of Turkey, and in the name of English interests, re-
motely and obscurely involved in any probable event, and, for the
present, not implicated at all. All consciousness of such a drift
not to say all co-operation, with it, Government in the first night of
this debate disavowed in the manly and, straightforward speech of
the Home SECRETARY. What he says, he stands by. His worst
enemy can never charge him with fighting a Cross. Henceforth
our Government is º as positively as a Government can be,
to neutrality in this unhappy but inevitable war—inevitable
mainly, as Punch is sorry to believe, through the timidity, shilly-
shallying, and half-heartedness of our Rulers—of Her Majesty’s
Opposition, as well as Her Majesty's Government.
MR. CRoss's distinct avowal of neutrality at this crisis, when the
dogs of war areſº their loudest, the country owes to MR. GLAD-
stone and his Resolutions—and, as things are, even this is a great
gain. -
Through Monday and Tuesday, Thursday and Friday nights, the
E.; went on, with much vehement recrimination ; and, after
the two great guns of the week were fired—MR. GLADSTone's in de-
fence of what might have been, MR. CRoss's in re-assurance as to what
is–with little increase either of sweetness or light in the House
whatever may have been the enlightening effect out of it. Punj.
waives the task of reiterating the iterations of the speakers
night after night; only noting that, for Turk, and against Russ
MR. CHAPLIN, SIR Robert PEEL, and LoRD ELCHO talked most wild
and whirlingly. while, on the other side, MR. CourTNEY was an
exception to the general rule of #. He boldly avowed his
regret at the watering down of the Resolutions, his readiness to have
supported the strongest of them, and his entire adherence to a policy
of coercion applied to Turkey.
Thus, all, the week has been taken up in a sharper defining of
parties and policies on this Eastern quarrel, and, above in
making it clear that England stands pledged not to strike on behalf
of the effete and unimprovable Turk—or, if she strike in at all, to do
so only on behalf of grave national interests, when those interests
are visibly menaced. When they are, it is quite certain that all par-
ties will be agreed that the time has indeed come for the British flion
to show his teeth. It is just as certain that that time is not yet.
Chaff at such a moment, and on such a subject, is impertinence,
Punch has felt a call to be serious, and to speak as he feels, without
even putting the thin mask of irony over his seriousness.
########. DUKE of ST. ALBANs had to withdraw his
Bill for Limiting the Hours of Railway Servants. For reasons good,
no doubt, the Bill may have been pronounced grude and impractic:
able; but the Companies will have to set their lines in order, and
treat their Servants with more decent consideration than they have
done, both as regards hours, rules, and protection of life and limb,
or it will be warmer than ever for them when they are, delivered
over, to the hands of the Juries, whose verdicts now . embod

§:...'..."; debate on the Resolutions was adjourned again
till Monday; and if it is finished then, it will be less because all
have said their say, than from SIR STAFFORD's threat, that if the
House, do not give the Government Tuesday night, it shall have
its Whitsun holidays docked. The truth is, that though, the
Resolutions may mean little, the discussion means a great deal, for
the country, even more than the House of Commons. England is
making up its mind, and will soon be ready to cast the weight of the
national will ***'. into which scale, that of Turkey and

say the former. Punch says the latter. Which can feel the national
pulse best?
THE WAGNER FESTIVAL.
AvLNG been a considerable time ac-
customed, to play, the Trilogy,
with one finger on the Accordion,
I was naturally anxious to hear the
same work of art performed by a Band
of two hundred, at the
Albert Hall.
HERR RICHARD WAGNER
wrote to me in his best low
Bavarian:—
“Ich bin gleich nach
London ge-komiſhen mit der
Trompeten und Drummen,
der brassen, der Winden
und der Fiddelstiickeren.
Du bist ein Musik-Kriti-
ker. Wie riel f Leben

Then—
“Postscriptum. Inklö-

. which I replied (in Saxon-Bavarian, which we both under-
stood)–
“O mein intimer Freund, Ich zee zou, blowen virst '... .Yotz ein

Why, I couldn't even get up a Torchlight Procession in Orme
Square with one thaler. It wouldn't run to one torch and a cab
fare. So that all my schemes for worthily celebrating, the grand
occasion fell to the ground. I had composed a Festival Hymn to
be sung to an air of BELLINI's under WAGNER's vinder in Orme
Square (where he is stopping, with HERR Toole, who “always
comes home to tea”), which ran (or would have run, if it had once
got a fair start) like this, -
“Orme ! Ormel Ormel sweet Orme !
Ho clever HERR WAGNER, there's no place like Orme !”
This was set to a bed-chamber-kandlestickeren “mºtive. and

“Well,” he began, “I rather think he—” But before the egregious

“Is that WAGNER P’’ she exclaimed; and then added, in a tone of considerable

Still I clung to him. I had heard him talk so much

still hoped that he might be the gifted creature I had
supposed.

E.; ut his work will stand and bear fruit if he has disabused England of
er old Turkish prepossessions, and delivered her soul from one of its most
evil, most unprofitable, and most dishonourable illusions.”—The Times.
Lo! the Man at the Wheel, all mysterious and mute,
At the helm of the good ship Britannia he stands,
A nautical Sphinx, dumb as death, cold and 'cute; . .
Hard-a-Porte he would steer, were her course in his hands.
'Twould go hard with the ship, if with dangers around,
Whate'er the crew fear, or whatever they feel,
None a question dared raise, while the rule all propound,
'Tis high treason to speak to the Man at the Wheel.
We would fain know the course our dark pilot is steering,
For the water it shoals and the rocks loom ahead:
There be those who believe that the breakers he's nearing,
But yet to “go aft” in a body they dread.
For they know that a clamorous part of the watch
Would as mutiny punish alarm or appeal—
And they think, come what may, no disaster could match
Such an act as to speak to the Man at the Wheel.
But a stout able-seaman, one W. E. G.
Has long had an eye on the chart and the course;
He the skipper distrusts now Britannia’s at sea,
And declines to take silence for BULL's best resource.
So he ups and says he, “Howsomever it be,
You're steering too much on the Porte tack, a deal.
The rest of the crew may be dumb, but for me,
I’m a-going to speak to the Man at the Wheel.”
And then comes a chorus of warning and threat—
Fierce charges of mutiny rain on his head;
His messmates fall off in alarm, or in pet,
For irons some call, or strait-waistcoat instead.
But that sturdy A.B. is not daunted, not he ;
Funk or flare-up who will, true and trenchant as steel,
Come foe or fail friend, there is W. E. G.,
Determined to speak to the Man at the Wheel.
Says WILLIAM, “Belay! This here Porte tack, I say,
sn't safe for the ship—with the chart doesn't square;
The war-rock you should clear lies full in your way,
And the sands and the shoals that you funk are not there.
All your bearings are wrong : you must try tºother tack.
For discipline's sake one can stand a good deal.
But ere on the rocks the Britannia's run smack,
'Tis time some one spoke to the Man at the Wheel.”
Says the Man at the Wheel, 'mid a volley of cheers,
“If this isn't mutiny, my coat ain't blue:
To#. the course your ship's officer steers!
on deserve to be clapped in the bilboes, you do!.
But the poor men you’ve gammoned your leading discard,
They’d rather we steered her than you, by a deal.
You deserve in a rope's-end to swing at a yard,
For daring to speak to the Man at the Wheel.”
But “Belay, there! belay!” sings out ADMIRAL BULL.
“Whether WILLIAM is right in the course he would steer
Is a question, perhaps; but by running rap-full -
On this Porte-tack the reefs you have brought the ship near.
With breakers ahead, and more minds, too, than one

In all the pathies
the choice of the

chiefly by the mala-
dy, little by the pa-

to be different. Not

that Scots have this

account for certain

Everybody takes
iron for the blood;

not thrive upon it.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MR. PUNCH*S SELECT COMMITTEES.
No. II.-ON ENTERTAINING.
MRs. TINSEL WALLFLow ER examined.
I BELIEVE you are
passionately fond of
entertaining
A. It is my chief,
and indeed I may
say my only occu-
pation.
. Q. What mean-
ing do you attach
to the word “enter-
taining” P
. A. By entertain-
ing, I mean col-
lecting an indefinite
number of friends
and acquaintances
together, under the
pretence of affording
them amusement.
Q. Are there
many kinds of en-
tertainments?
A. Certainly.
First, there are din-
ners; secondly, af-
ternoon crushes;
and, thirdly, ama-
teur theatricals.
Q. Do you not occasionally give a dance P
A. Yes, or, to be more accurate, an “at home.” At my “dances,”
however, Í do not expect my guests to dance. ... I therefore crowd into a rºom
capable, of containing twenty pººl, with comfort about ten times the number.
I provide a band, consisting of a piano, a violin, and a cornet, and this band
plays some thirty waltzes.
: In your experience, have you known persons who have attended your
“at homes” attempting a dance? - --
A. Frequently; but the attempts have invariably ended in disaster. The
Gentleman has had to apologise for treading upon some one else's toes, and the
Lady has found her dress torn to atoms. -
Have you no other place for your guests besides the drawing-room?
A: The staircase. On their arrival, my friends are kept for half an hour on
the staircase, whilst they are slowly making their way to the floor above.
Q. Describe their introduction. -
... A..They are expected to give their name to the page in the hall, who passes
it on (inaccurately) to the footman on the first flight, who shouts it out to the
greengrocer on the first landing. The greengrocer then calls out what he
pleases to me, and I smile, shake hands, and leave my guests to be comfortably
crushed in the so-called dancing-room.
Q. Do you provide any refreshments for your ſº * . . -
A. Certainly. Weak tea, lukewarm ices, and dry biscuits. Later in the
evening I expect them to partake of supper—a meal in which tough fowls and
liquid jellies play important parts.
Q. Describe one of your dinner parties. - -
A. I ask a number of people with various pursuits and tastes to dine with
me on a fixed date, and then provide them with a feast composed of indifferent
home-made soup, and nasty dishes with imposing names, obtained from the shop
of a neighbouring pastry-cook. -
Q. Do you not think that it would be better to provide your guests with
honest, homely fare, such as a fried sole and a joint of meat, rather than the
motley and messy meal you have just described P
A. Certainly not;. If I did, my guests would consider me, vulgar. More
than this, they would believe my łºś. was cutting down his expenses to
save himself from an appearance in the Court of Bankruptcy.
Q. What do you mean by an “afternoon crush” P
A. It differs very little from an “at home,” except that in the place of a
band and a dance-programme I substitute a concert by amateurs of first-rate
conceit and ninth-rate talent.
Q. I suppose that at these “afternoon crushes” the refreshments are scarcely
on the same elaborate scale as that you adopt for your more pretentious enter-
tainments? -
A. They are not. My “crushes” are held in the afternoon, and, conse-
quently, I supply my friends with appropriate refreshments in the shape of cold
coffee and weak tea. I may add that an “afternoon crush” is the most
economical entertainment that can be given. . .
You said something about amateur theatricals}
. 4. Yes. If you have two small drawing-rooms you can convert one of them
into a stage and the other into an auditorium. Amateur theatricals are decidedly
advantageous if you have any daughters to marry. Rehearsals are conducive
to mild flirtation; and by y selecting the period of your pieces you can
dress your children in the most becoming costumes.
Q. Do you think it advisable to ask any other young
ladies to join * daughters in the performances?
A. Certainly ; but you should be careful to select
those only who are not likely to shine either by their
bºº their talent.
Q. Do you not think that this is treating your guests
rather harshly P
A. No. When your friends accept an invitation to be
present at private theatricals they should be prepared for
the worst.
Q. Will you kindly tell me why you entertain P
A. Because I wish to be entertained in return. I
expect every card I issue to produce a pack.
!. From your own showing ent ing is not con-
ducive to much enjoyment. Under these circumstances,
will you kindly say why you like entertainments?
A. I presume for the same reason that one likes other
things—because they are the fashion.

A STATUE AT LAST.
(John BULL sings.)
I HAVE Artists, more than one,
o can draw and sketch like fun,
Even turn decent pictures off the easel;
Many Brothers of the Brush,
Who for bays may make a rush.
But scarce ever had a topper at the Chisel,-
One to cut out competition with the Chisel,-
A master hand at moulding-tool and Chisel,
Whom you’d quote, beyond a doubt,
As a Sculptor out-and-out-
A first-chop out-and-outer at the Chisel!
But at last I’ve got one, who,
Whilst a Painter, models too,
In a manner the Laocoön to match you.
For solid proof, no myth, on
His “Athlete against Python,”
I fall back, to show we can ºt. a Statue;
Because now LEIGHToN has made a Statue;
So he and I can both show a Statue,
§ºying, “Look you there, and see,
There’s a Statue made by me;
Yes, at last, by Jove, I can make a Statue!”

WHIsTLER, and any one who may be following his
musical lead, the following suggestions for tone-pictures
to COme.
1. * Arrangement (with Creditors) in Blue (3d. in the

THE REPROACH OF IACHIMO.
“The country will sadly say of him (MR. GLAPstoniº) what
Imogen says in Cymbeline, “My Lord, I fear, has forgºt Britain.'
while history will add, as Iachimo does, “And himself.”—Daily

“HAs forgot Britain?” Blatant bunkum shapes
A Britain generous Britons would disown-
A mock-BRITANNIA, whose stage ermine drapes
A sham of frothy selfishness up-blown.
The truest lover of his land is not
The tap-room patriot of the pipe and pot.
“Forgot himself?” Aye, in a nobler sort
Than sordid self-regard can understand.
What?" Brave the loud reproach, the fºul report,
The taunt of treason to his native land!
Bah! how should base Iachimo do less
Than scoffat such fine self-forgetfulness?

PUNCHPS ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
*Sºtº-
Riº T. Ay, why should, LoRD
Rosebery vex himself
(Lords, Monday, May 14)
º about our possible en-
º tanglements under the
f Tripartite Treaty? LoBD
DERBY looks on Treaty
obligations, as Jove on lovers' vows, as paper
promise whose violationismatterfor laughter,
not wrath, still less thunderbolts. He sees no
likelihood of our being called on to fulfil our
Tripartite undertakings. But to propose to
Austria and France a mutual release from them might “create unpleasantness.”
LoRD DERBy hates unpleasantness, except on paper; and there he is rather a
master of it, as witness his answer to PRINCE GoRTschakoff. For pluck in
º: paper-slap in the face, or meekness in taking one, commend us to
RD DERBY. As an example of the one, take his answer to PRINCE GoRT-
SCHAKOFF; as an ... of the other, his submission to the Turkish treatment
of his Atrocity Dispatch. Judging by the last year's annals, this has hitherto
been the highest of LoRD DERRY's qualifications for the Foreign Office. But
now another looms upon us. Where among diplomatic cobblers is his equal for
making a tight Treaty sit easy P If he had the shaping of diplomatic “under-
standings,” there wouldn't be an international corn to tread on.
(Commons.)—Close of the Eastern Debate. Among the dramatis personae of
the evening were SIR. W. W. HARcoubt, MR. FAwcETT, LoRD HARTINGTON, THE
CHANCELLOR of THE ExcBEQUER, MR. GLADSTONE, MR. E. JENKINs, CHEvaLIER
O'CLERy, and MAJOR O'Gorman. The question has clearly run the gamut of
the Collective Wisdom.
Let us note a memorable utterance of the Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition,
It touches the line of argument taken by our warlike contemporaries, the D.T.
and the P. M. “If,” said LoRD HARTINGTON, “for the security of our Indian
Empire, it be necessary that we should fight against the forces of nature, and
the laws of human progress, then, I say, we have undertaken a task too great.
I say there is no power which can restore the sap and vigour of a lifeless trunk;
and there is no power which can check the growth of the living, although
struggling, tree. The Turkish dominion, is the lifeless trunk; the subject
nationalities are the living tree: and to-night the House is asked to assert that
with them, and not with the remnants of a and shameful past, the
destinies of our Empire shall be associated.” LoRD HARTINGTON sat down with
these pregnant words. Punch says Ditto to LoRD HARTINGTON.
SIR STAFFORD took a leaf, not out of Punch, but out of Punch's waste-
paper basket, in the shape of a poor parody on Wordsworth's “We are
Seven '', but he may yet find that the third and fourth of GLADSTONE's Resolu-
tions, though dead in the House of a compact Tory majority, yet live in the
heart of England, to take shape in the policy of the nation. . -
MR. GLADSTONE's reply did justice to the only new point that has arisen
since this debate began–LoRD DERBY's answer to PRINCE GoRTSCHAKOFF. He
showed how, if the Neutral Head of the Government Janus had spoken from
the Exchequer and the Home Office, the other, or Non-Neutral Head, had
uttered itself through that impolitic and insulting paper – which quite
#. what hitherto has been its sole reward—the thanks of the Turkish
arliament.

The mighty Major had the last twenty-five minutes of
the talk to himself, and managed to make the House
laugh, in spite of its weariness and eagerness for the
division, at his dissertation on the nationality of the
Bashi-Bazouks, whom the Major made Quà with that
Milesian logic of which he alone commands “the blend,”
to be Russian. So, Senatus locutus est.' But Bos
locutus est, too. How do their utterances tally? And
which is likely to be weightiest in the long run ?
Tuesday (Lords).-LoRD CARNARNoN added to his
South African Bill a clause empowering HER MAJESTY
in Council to add to Cape Colony or Natal any British
territory in South Africa; through which clause one
sees the claws of Great Britain clutching the Transvaal.
In the matter of that most unwilling incorporation (on
both sides) the Boer seems to be behaving less boorishly
than was anticipated. LoRD CARNARwon explained that
it was a sheer case of self-preservation. BoER-BAAs
would set the Zulu kraals onfire, and Natal House was
next door to the Zulu kraals—nay, had some of them in
its very back-yard; so we have been obliged to take the
matches out of BoER-BAAs's hand, and to tell BoER-BAAs
that in future he will not be allowed to fling fire about
so near JoHN BULL's South-African dry-wood store
and powder-magazine.
(Commons.)-MR. Bourke was able to ease the anxious
mind of MR. B. DENIson. Neither Foreign Office nor
Indian Office has heard anything of Russian armaments
for invading India, from Tashkend, via the Pamir Steppe
—nor, Punch is happy to add for MR. DENIson's com-
fort, via the Mountains of the Moon either. My dear
MR. DENIson, do study your map—STIELER's Hand-
Atlas will dº—and our Russophobes will say is the very
one to consult on a point of Russian aggression, and you
will see that the Pamir Steppe is a step j the stride
of even seven-leagued Russia-leather boots.
After many protests from private Members, who don't
like their private Motions shunted to make way for the
Government Parliamentary goods train, but who can't be
allowed to stand in the way of the Whitsun holidays,
the Universities Bill was got into Committee, and kept
the House busy for the rest of the evening. The most
burning question likely to rise out of it—that of Clerical
Fellowships—is to be postponed till the last.
“Worth makes the man, the want of it the fellow"
has often been ironically quoted against the old order
of celibate and clerical socii, Let us hope that, in the
good time coming, the worth of the Fellow will rise as his
shackles of celibacy and clerical orders fall.
(Wednesday.)—Two Bills of CAPTAIN BEDFord PrM;
one for establishment of County. Naval Training Ships
and Schools (which the local authorities have power to
establish *...*} and the other for Compulsory Mer-
cantile Marine º: The House seemed to class
both º under the Silly-Billy category, when
it divided, 83 to 17 against the first, and 212 to 11
against the second.
Thursday (Lords).--The fight of Church and Chapel
on this side the grave is happily at an end. Their Lord-
ships divided 102 to 102 on LoBD HARRowby's clause—
identical with LoRD GRAN VILLE's—allowing burials
with such Christian, orderly, and º service as the
relatives of the dead think fit, or without any service at
all, with due provisions for notice to the incumbent, and
so forth. In the House of Lords a tie counts for Non-
content. Out of their House this tie will count for Con-
tent; in other words, everybody will be satisfied with
this end of a most miserable, and in all senses, mis-
chievous squabble—but no thanks to a Government that
has shown itself less liberal in this matter than its own
Bench of Bishops. We assume that the clause will be
inserted in the Commons, and that the Government will
grin and bear it. Besides this end of Nonºmist
strife, the ARCHRISHop of CANTERBURY carried a clause
authorising the Clergy, with licence of the Bishop, to use
a special service, for special cases, in substitution for the
Church burial-service,
The Government opposed this, too. They won't agree
to provide a plaster either for the Nonconformist's raw

MR. HUNT did condescend to say that he had never seen or heard of
any other Report, and that the only Admiralty letter about this
Report was one of thanks to the Čommittee for the pains they had
taken. . Mr. Punch has too much respect for MR. Hunt's intelligence
to feel it necessary to do more than hint to him, that the terms of
his answer are perfectly compatible with a state of facts which
would rather justify, MR. MITCHELL HENRY's question, than MR.
WARD HUNT's way of not replying to it. MR. HENRY means to turn
his question into a Motion.
Of course the Government will accept the Harrowby clause, and |. After disposing of a long list of unconsidered trifles in the shape

Let us rejoice that, after all, the most of question and answer, the House got into Committee on the Uni-
obnoxious portion of the DUKE of RICHMOND's Bill, as Mr. Punch
anticipated, will have the honour of the one silent burial that will
follow upon its introduction.
(Commons.)—MR, MITCHELL HENRY asked MR. WARD HUNT-
whom the House cheered on seeing in his place again, as big, and
burly as ever—whether the Scurvy Report, published in the Times
of the 16th, was the Report as made, or as modified under Admiralty
or other official pressure ?
On this MR. WARD HUNT flew into such a passion, and jumped
so high up on his official dignity in his refusal to answer the
question, that it is impossible not to think there must be something
in the matter that made it one more proper to 'ask, than easy to
answer. At last, under pressure of the milder wisdom of PLAYFAIR,

not anticipate the dénoument.
The Scene represents the interior of a House from the Cellar to the
Drawing-rooms on the first-floor. The windows are at the back,
looking out on the Squares of Belgravia.
The three Kitchenmaidens (MARIHANN, LISAJANE, and MYTILDA),
with brooms and dusters, are seen gliding about on the Drawing-
room floor, ascending ladders to clean the upper panes of %.
windows, descending to break the china ornaments on the tables,
and mounting again on chairs and sofas to dust the Pictures, as
with their crinolines they gracefully sweep the articles of vertà
off the brackets.
MARIHANN has poised herself on the fifth rung of a light ladder
which rests against the mantelpiece, where stands a magnificent
Clock under a glass shade.

An Easy Riddle.

ELCHO inquired, “What could be more monstrous than the idea
of Russia fighting for civil and religious liberty?” Why—“The

“ St. BARNABAs's CHURCH,
PIMLIco.—We are informed that
the eucharistic vestments, duly pro-
vided by the churchwardens and
arishioners of St. Barnabas's
hurch, Pimlico, were introduced
and worn there on Ascension Day.”
It was but for a very little
while that the Clergy of St.
Barnabas could enjoy the plea-
sure of wearing these vest-
ments, and the congregation
that of admiring the reverend
gentlemen in their ornamental
attire. Ascension Day fell on
Thursday the 10th instant, and

to be. This ...i.a. will probably induce economical Ladies
in Belgravia, if there are any, to inquire about the millinery now
lying useless in the wardrobe under the care of those gentlemen, in
order to ascertain what they would take for it; because, though
interdicted to Clergymen, it might be º: to girls, and no
doubt prove wholly or in part convertible into skirts, petticoats,
and other articles of finery suitable to the softer sex.
FROM THE RIGHT HAND, INTO THE RIGHT HANDS.
WHAT less large and liberal hand than that of England, embodied
in England's Queen, should have been put forth to save the last
living descendants of DANIEL DE Foe, now old, infirm, and penni-
less, from the choice between starvation and the Workhouse?
The queen's help has been given in such a representative act
of well-timed, as sore-needed, bounty, to these representatives of
a famous writer, and a patriot as faithful as ill-rewarded, even as
it was, a short time ago, to the Banff cobbler and Scottish naturalist,
TAM Edward. DEFog's great-great-granddaughters are henceforth
secured from misery by pensions of £75 a-year each, in payment
(if but of a poor instalment) of the debt due to the Author of
Robinson Crusoe from all generations of English-speaking men of
the two last centuries.
Errors of the Press.
MR. Forsyth is not usually chargeable with, strong language;
but we find this strong expression scored to him in the Daily
News –“The Pall Mall Gazette used to boast, it was written by
Gentlemen for Gentlemen. From its raving style lately, it seemed
to be written by maniacs for fools.” This must be an egregious
error of the Press! What MR. Forsyth did say, of course, was “by
Statesmen for Patriots.”

“WOODMAN SPARE THAT TREE | *
Quoth BEACONSFIELD THE MYSTERIOUS.
Quoth WILLIAM THE WooDMAN–
“SPARE it?” Too long the sapless trunk has stood,
Blasted and bare, the spectre of the wood.
If once in stately strength it towered, and drew
From earth and air, noon sun, and morning dew,
Their liberal tribute to its swelling growth,
It gave but scant return. The axe is loth
To fell the forest pride, but if the blade
Of gallant SoBIEski had been laid
Sheer to that root two hundred years ago,
Nor lopped limb only, but the trunk brought low,
Fairer had spread the forest, nobler trees
A fertile soil had fed, the eastern breeze,
Untainted by the Upas breath that blasts
Where'er this trunk its withering shadow casts,
Had been far fresher, and our Western ways
Had known serener nights and brighter days.
Its shade was never shelter, its foul form
Brake not the hurricane, but drew the storm.
What budding slips of promise ever sprang
Within its range; what songsters ever sang
Faith's lay or Freedom's, where its umbrage spread
Thick gloom of night, and darkness of the dead?
Too slow it dies; its long decay is rife
With nought but loathsome forms of leprous life.
Why spare the blasted tree ? That once again,
Fed by its native draught of War's red rain,
It É. revive a moment, and prolong
A little while the rule of wrath and wrong?
Or is the plea perchance not pity's own,
But the appeal of “patriotism,” grown
So impotent of mood as to invoke
The Upas' shadow to protect our Oak P
Shall we, the warrior-traders of the West,
Preserve the trunk whose presence genders pest,
In hope that its last leaves, though shrunk and sear,
Of the steppe-hurricane may ward the fear?
The tree must fall, whose branches only grow
Parasites of corruption. Lay it low !
Blood stains its bole, and none but gibbet-fruit
Hangs from its cankered boughs. From crown to root
'Tis rottenness. Were’t mercy to withhold
The Woodman's trenchant steel? Be just, be bold !
"Let in fresh air, give younger growths free space;
Forests may flourish in this blasted place,
Of vigorous spread, of timber straight and sound.—
But for this tree, why cumbers it the ground?
EXTRAORDINARY EFFECTS OF THE “MUSIC OF THE
FUTURE.”

periodicals, rushed out into the road, in front of the Albert Hall,
and embracing an Italian Organ-grinder, shouted, in a passion of

performance, and though convinced that in the Wagnerian cataclysm
the musical world had come to an end, kept on muttering to himself,

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(Some Account of the Amusements of the Season, chiefly Musical
—Albert Hall, Covent Garden, Gaiety, and Alhambra-by Our
Iregular. Representative (bond fide).)
HE Wagner Fes-
* tival is over.
º After most fes-
tivals comes the
inevitable head-
ache: not after
this. Many who
N went to scoff, re-
mained to praise.
The “Rhine-
Gold” is a mas-
ter-piece. This is
not a discovery of
mine. To under-
stand it, a tho-
rough acquaint-
ance with the
stage - directions
is absolutely ne-
cessary. From
dicta of experi-
enced Bayreuth-
ians itseemstome
that this drama-
tic Tone - Poem,
this, “Arrange-
ment in String
and Wind,” as
MR, WHISTLER would call it, must inevitably be vulgarised by repre-
sentation on the stage. For example, admirable as is, in general,
the mise-en-scène at Covent Garden, how utterly destructive of the
poety of LöHENGRIN are the common-place, wandering-eyed
“Chorus-Gentlemen,” who appear as “Saxon and Thuringian
Nobles l’ how poor the effect of the narrow, marshy-looking river,
the Scheldt, in the background, while only children could be in-
terested in the Property Swan with an uneasy head, and the wobbling
Pantomime º coming down avery evident wire. The spectacle
of the first and last Acts is only tolerable from a MADAME Tussaud
int of view. But, such a mise-en-scène as . The Nibelung's Rin
emands is impossible. The attempt to realise its sublime woul
most certainly result in achieving our ridiculous. From Wagner-
libretto to Pantomime-opening is, scenically, but a step.
A propos of Covent Garden, ADELINA DINoRAH PATTI was enthusi-
astically received by a most brilliant house on her rentrée, Tuesday
15th May. That her voice exercised its magic charm over the crowded
audience was proved by the determined encore of the “Shadow Song,”
and by her being recalled four times after that, by acclamation, and
then thrice before the curtain. , MR.GYE should be a happy man to
have such a dish to set before his visitors as this delicious PATTI.
MLLE. ALBANI has taken the house by storm in the Puritani and
Rigoletto, which last mentioned opera is admirably cast. This year
SCALCHI, ALBANI, GAYARRE and PANDoIFINI, being the quartette,
SIGNOR PANDoLFINI plays the Fool capitally—I mean in Rigoletto.
In recent programmes MR. GXE has kindly consented to drop the
accent over the “e” in SIGNOR GAYARRE's name, which is Spanish,
and not to be pronounced as “Gay 'Arry.” However, accents will
happen in the best regulated families. ...Why are the Entr'actes so
long? Better late than never—but still from 8:30 till half-past
midnight is too much of the best thing. An Opera should now be
announced as in three Acts and two long Entr'actes, the curtain to
rise un-punctually, at some time or other, the whole to conclude
exactly when it is finished, and not one minute after.
From Italian to French. ºff. Cards having gone with MR.
Toole into the provinces, MR. HollingsHEAD plays a fresh hand.
Over the Gaiety for the next six weeks is to be written, “Ici on
parle Français"—not in farce, but in earnest. L'Ami Friº,
as Cockneydom will call it, “Lummy Fritz”—will be one of the
trumps in the pack. MLL.E. CHAUMonT, returns, with La bonne
Année—which does not, when translated, mean the Nurserymaid
ANNIE-though that might not be a bad subject for a Music-Hall
ditty. This is something to look forward to.
Orphée aur Enfers, at the Alhambra, is well worth seeing.
A little dialogue goes a long way in a grand º: Opéra bouffe
at the Alhambra, and, therefore, a piece better adapted to the
requirements of this particular place: though it is scarcely fair to
accuse the Alhambra of being "particular”—could not have been
selected than MR. H. S. LEIGH’s version of the Orphée. A more
charming representative of the coquette Eurydice {{.. our hand-
some erican cantatrice, MIss MUNRoE, could not be found in
London, though a blasé Parisian might probably demand more
abandon in the thoroughly Offen-bacchanalian song which crowns
the banquet Aur Enfers. But this objection applies to all Pluto's
Olympian guests, whose after-supper conduct in Pandemonium is as
degorous as that of a party of more modern Divines at a Lambeth
Palace lawn-party.
Where all is so well done it may be invidious to single out any one
artiste for special praise; but it is only fair to notice Miss L. Rob-
son's intelligent, and spirited rendering of the rôle of Public
Opinion,--a really original creation, by the way, of the French
librettist, M. HECTOR CREMIEUx. But for this young lady's
dramatic ** the finish of the first Act would have been a
tame affair. If the Poetic Librettist attended rehearsals, he
must have given up in despair all attempts at getting the Gods
and Goddesses to pronounce the classical names correctly. Aristaus
on the Alhambra stage is generally called “Aristèus.” Actaeon is
alluded to as “Act&on ”; while everybody takes his or her own
private, view of Orpheus, who is sometimes “Orpheus,” some:
times “Qrphéus,” and sometimes, “Öffyus.”. But only once did
I hear the hero of the Opera called “Orphéâs.” R. JACOBI's
Orchestra, is as good, as ever; . and if it, were objected to as
occasionally too loud for the voices, its astute and experienced
Conductor would probably reply, “So much the better for the
voices.” I am not disposed to quarrel with him on this score—or on
any other; “scores” being his forte. The mise-en-scène is excel-
lent, the costumes superb and summery; while for spectacle and
f. effect no revival of this Opéra bouffe, on the Parisian or
ndon Stage, can be placed on a par with orphée aur Enfers as at
present given at the Alhambra. These, Sir, are the sentiments of
YoUR REPRESENTATIVE.

THE INTELLECTUAL “DIES NON.”
WERY REVEREND, MR. PUNCH,
. . In personally addressing you, I may appear an odd sort of person, being deemed a
thing impersonal; however, I venture to take the liberty of personifying myself. Please
to suppose that I have a self to personify. But an account of myself will render myselfhood
self-evident. I am a Day. No relation to John DAY, the famous jockey and trainer, whose
name is borne by one of the principal horses now figuring in the racing news. I am not one
of the DAYs of Danebury. I am a Day of the week, and have nothing whatever to do
with horse-racing—that is, at home. They manage these things otherwise—I won't say
better, in France. “The better the day the better the deed”—when the deed admits of
the comparative, better; but betting is always positively bad, and better it can never be.
Cavillers may object, if they like, that I have no business to be called a day, because in
law I am no day, being a dies non, whereon, no business can be transacted. That I do
not mind; but what I don't like is being made a dies non not only for business purposes,
but also for those of enjoyment, and above all, for that needful restorative from the toils
of business—recreation.
That Lought not to be a dies non altogether is evident from the names I commonly go
by, Dies Solis and Dies Dominica, both of which I acknowledge. But I am also denomi-
nated by an alias I disown. Certain parties
call me Dies Sabbati. I am nothing of the
kind, as MR. SolomoNs will tell you. I am
the first day of the week, and not the
seventh; and, whilst a holy day, also a
holiday. As such everybody should keep
me, to make me the Institution I might be
made. Church and Chapel occupy but some
hours of me. What are people to do during
my remainder-hours? They will do some-
thing, and DR. WATTs has mentioned what
sort of occupation is found for idle hands,
and by whom. -
One such occupation is boozing in a
ublic-house. Thither poorfolks are driven
a stupid system of closing better places
§§ it is the object, of a Society calle
after me to get opened during some of my
hours. It met on Saturday last week at
the Freemasons' Tavern; the DEAN of
WESTMINSTER, its President, in the Chair.
DEAN STANLEY was supported by most of
the wisest men now in Town, including
DR. B. W. RICHARDSON, PROFESSOR: MoR-
LEY, and PROFEssoRs Huxley and TYNDALL,
who would, but for an illness in the family
of a noble Lady, have been reinforced by
LADY BURDETT CouTTs. This Meeting
unanimously voted resolutions soliciting the
Government and Legislature to sanction,
on the First Day of the Week (improperly
called by ignorant pietists the Sabbath, and
still more improperly by the Scotch part of
them Sawbbath), the opening of Museums,
Picture Galleries, Libraries, and other places
of rational entertainment, at which between
the hours of religious service, it may be
possible for the British Public to devote
their leisure, otherwise than to animal
leasure or degrading excess, and employ
it in the cultivation of those attributes by
which civilised mankind are º
distinguished from pigs. I hope, Very
Reverend Sir, you do me the kindness
to assist the endeavour to obtain this right
for the Working Classes especially, since the
only day, in the week on which it is
ssible for them to benefit by national
xhibitions and Literary and Scientific
Institutions is your obedient servant to
command,
SUNDAY.
P.S.—No need to deprive attendants of
Sunday's rest. A few extra policemen
could supply their places. Besides, there is
the above-named gentleman MR. SolomoNs,
and other members of his community,
MESSRs. ABRAHAMs, Isa ACs, JAcobs, Moss,
and LEwis, to name but a few, who observe
the original Sabbath upon Saturdays;
many of whom would be glad to earn a
shekel or so by relieving guard at public
Institutions on Sundays.
“I)issent and Desecration.”
THE point of interment in churchyards
having been conceded to Nonconformists,
how superfluous it seems on the part of any
of the Clergy and their representatives to
insist upon “silent burial,” as the alterna:
tive for the Church service. If the burial
of the dead does not desecrate consecrated
ground, still less can any appropriate utter-
ance of the living. Dissent can only be
aggravated by being forbidden to speak;
for if the Nonconformist is compelled to be
silent at the side of a grave, will he not,
like the celebrated parrot of Mr. Joseº
MILLER, only think the more ?

SECOND WEEK.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.—Devoted to musketry, position drill and
target practice. At the first, the men (without targets) were taught to aim,
theoretically, at something in particular. At the last, the men (with targets)
learned, practically, to fire at nothing in particular. The markers at the ranges
slept better than the scorers. General discomfort and discouragement of

“POTS l’”
“Pots mean civilisation, and the history of pottery is the
history of culture. . . . For what would man be without a
pot of some sort? . . . . The uniformity in human nature has
always shown itself manifest in pottery.”—The “Daily News”
on MR. GLADstone's Address upon Pottery at the Cymro-
dorion Society.
Whereat some one of the loquacious Lot,
I think a Súfi pipkin-waxing hot—
“All this of Pot and Potter P Tell me then
“Who makes—who sells—who buys—who is the Pot?”
OMAR KHAYYAM.
Pori.Ess Humanity! A pregnant thought
With much suggestion fraught
Which Persian OMAR in the Potter's House,
Surrounded by the ordered shapes of clay,
Somehow missed marking in his distant day,
For all his keen but pessimistic nous.
Man the Pot-shaperſ. A new definition!
Oh, for an exhibition
Of Pots from Egypt's earliest to—ah! What?
That one ideal, final, transcendental,
Supreme Supernal Pot, - - -
Which, on this view, should mark the culmination,
The highest tide-mark of Art-cultivation,
o which our Earth hath got.
Oh, what a Pot were that! Will GLADSTONE's self
Help us so far to soar in the ideal, -
As to adumbrate that most rare, if real,
Result from centuries of clay and delf,
That fictile ultimatum ? Fancy faints
At the prodigious prospect. Memory paints
Pictures of recent raptures witnessed oft
In eyes of Ladies, heard from lips less soft
Qf ardent greybeards, over bits of crockery
Of such amazing immature monstrosity,
Chaos chromatic, shapeless squat atrocity,
That it were surely mockery -
To fancy they comprised one genuine quality
Of the great Pot-finality.
But if these wake such ecstasies, oh what
Delirium of unspeakable delight,
Supreme and infinite,
Should be the product of the Crowning Pot?
Yes, Pots mean progress! Thoughtful souls must feel
The wheel of Fortune is a potter's wheel.
KHAYYKM drew doleful auguries from its twirl,
But then he was a poet and a Persian,
A sceptic too, at whom, with cold aversion,
The British Philistine's fine lip will curl.
Yet this new doctrine of the Daily News
Might fire a Western muse,
Not such as she who sat at OMAR's suppers,
But cool, correct, and orthodox as TUPPER's.
If life’s a cruz, a labyrinth, a lottery,
The clue, the key to it is found in Pottery.
How pleasant ’twere, did time allow, to trace
In pots and pans the progress of our race |
Each page of time the potter leaves his print on,
From Greek HYPERBIUs to HERBERT MINTON.—
A longish stretch,
Through which a compass critical to fetch—
Displays in stereotype all human passions,
Utilities and tastes, prides, follies, fashions.
Thus, potted and preserved, lies record strange
Qf human progress, in ceramic change—
(Or say keramic, since our classic day
Is very sweet on the initial “k”.)
-
The Epic of the Pot! Who'll write it? See,
Oh, versatile and vehement W. G.
When you have polished off such minor works
As utter demolition of the Turks,
Here is a task for you!
“Pots, and the man I sing.”. Yes, that will do.
Its title P The Fictiliad. 'Tis a theme
To satisfy a Neo-Homer's dream.
Wire in, my WILLIAM! show the world what’s what
In Epos. "Twere a splendid consummation;
A nobler, wider subject is there not
Since without Pots all Earth's Civilisation
Must—go to Pot!

“O, my prophetic soul! my Uncle!” and lucky for you to have such an
Uncle on the turf and not under it yet, my boy. To-day is “the glad day
of all the bright new year,” as our sporting poet Laureate Ten-to-ºne-
yson says; never mind if I don't quote him exactly, for genius, my dear
Young OBADIAH, is above rules, and my quotations, as you know-no one
better—are mostly from the Latest. Betting. Rely on your Uncle,
ORADIAH, my boy, and your Uncle will pull you through. You want no

There was a private trial 'the other morning. Your old Uncle got

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIWARL
[JUNE 2, 1877.
There is no Race but the Derby,
and Punch is its Prophet."
Here is his Tip—get all you can
off it.
A FRENch horse, by an English
jockey ridden, ...
The Turf's Blue Riband may
...bear off unchidden;
But back no horse whose jock is changed too late,
For, favourite though he be, 'tis tempting fate.
The “pot” put on to boil his peas, we see no
Hard#. grimage too hard for Pellegrino.
Rob ſ s the good old rule, the simple plan–
Take, all who have the power, and keep who can;
On a dark horse if you would breathe the air,
Seek one that bears the bell in Beau-repaire.
If little Altyre no mishap befall,
'Tis like enough the dwarf will yet tire all.
Hidalgo's promises loom large but dim-
Let who will §: the Spanish upon him.
And what if Silvio's name be shorn of Pellico's P
Against his backers be not, therefore, bellicose.
While the big stake stands tempting horse and mare,
Your cry may well be “Touchet” if you darel
Upon Jagellon they who post the coal
Back one who stands, by race, head of the Pole. .
Let Plunger plunge, and with him, plunge who will.
What grist may come from Lady Miller's Mill?
For HADJI BABK's sake, I'd scarce be sorrier
To lose my old, than gain a new “do,” Morier.
A cell's º: place who choose the Grey Friar weed;
Thunderstone may mean bolts, or lightning's speed.
Who says Brown Prince's backers are done brown,
Or to Masaniello trusts a crown?
Since his break-down among the lazzaroni,
Those who’d brave risk º him for a pony.
You have my tips—you see Fate's book unsealed;
The course is clear: forearmed, you take the field.
DERBY DRAGS FOR 1877.
Lord Beaconsfield's.-The fear that he won't be able to crown his
career as a statesman with a sensational war.
Lord Hartington's.--The dread that MR. GLADSTONE's enthusiasm
mº, his discretion, to the embarrassment of the Liberal Party.
r. Gladstone's-Anxiety lest the pens of a belligerent fraction
of the Press may drown the voice of an impassioned and impulsive,
but much in earnest orator.
Cabinet may be
Mr. Cross's.-Apprehension that the balance of Power in the
- isturbed by the false weights of Disraelitish
mystifications.
Lord Derby's.-Comparison of the aims and achievements of the
last eighteen months' diplomacy.
Mr. Whalley's.-The belief, that every second person on the
Downs is a Jesuit, and every third a Cardinal in disguise.
Sir Wilfrid Lawson's.-The thought of the drinking for drunky
that will wash down the revels of the Day.
. Major Q'Gorman's.-The regret that all this power of drink and
divarsion is wasted over the could-hearted Saxon on Epsom Downs
instead of turned to profit of the raal Irish at Punch's Town.
The Upper Ten Thousand's. The depressing reflection that the
Derby will have to be “done” again next year.
The LowerTwo Million's.--The sad thought that the Derby outing
comes like the “grotter,” only once a year.
And, lastly, Mr. Punch's.-The certainty that no Derby Day will
be considered complete without a perfectly novel dº propos Cartoon.
THE FRENCH CRACK AND HIS JOCKEYS.
An d propos Apologue.
A RACER's points he shows—the crack French horse,
Looks fit for any course,
Though best at a ºf spin or rattling spurt.
Pace is his special glory, and indee
ew nags have shown a finer turn of speed.
And though but late recovered from a hurt.
That might have spoilt his running, all admit'
That the French Favourite's in first-rate fettle,
º in temper, easier on the bit,
And with new stamina to help old mettle.
The public in his later form confiding
Though there's a trick of temper in the stock,
Would freely back the big horse for big stakes,
ne.thing alone solicitude awakes-
The animal requires such careful º -
And ought to be on good terms with his jock:
No boy can steer him, and the man who errs
In too much or too little whip or spurs, -
Qr strives to hold hard when the nag's for going,
Will find he courts a cropper. This well knowing,
Qne would suppose the Stable would take care
On no account to irritate the crack:
Would put their cleverest rider on his back,
And once safe in the saddle, keep him there:
But crass caprice of sense the eternal mock is,
And this French Favourite's trainers oft have shown
A most unlucky taste for changing jockeys,
Though rider after rider has been thrown,
Race after race been lost, and the brave horse, ...
In hands that took hard holding for good guiding,
Fretted to death, brought from bad form to worse,
- º nothing but had riding.
Still the unstable Stable courts disgrace
By ſº jockeys just before the race,
And that, although the man that had the mount,
Was one on whom folks felt that they could count,
For good nerve, seat defying bolt or rearing,
Head enough for straight steering
Hand firm, yet light, and knowledge of the course,
To get the best jock could out of the horse;
When lo, a sudden row—a secret bobbery!
is't stable jealousy, or backer's jobbery,
Touts' trick or tipsters'? At the trainer's frown,
The lad that was up, must at once get down,
While with a wicked eye, and levelled ear.
Half in rage, half in fear,
The horse waits his new jock—the Stable's pick
Is hardly of the best—
And once the brute takes to back-jump and kick,
He's one to put the tightest seat to test.
'Tis ten to one the new man that the Stable
Puts up will prove to steer the horse unable,
And find dismounting easier than mounting, ..
Spite of the j. and spur on which he's counting.
es—'tis long odds, thanks to this change, that France
as missed another chance.
When will their Stable learn a wiser way,
And give the Favourite French horse fair play?

HOW TO TURN AN HONEST PENNY.
(A Suggestion for the Bathing Season about to begin.)
THE PICK OF THE PICTURES.
*...* In continuing this Guide, it is necessary to remind our readers that it does not profess to
describe or criticise the Pictures, but to give them such new titles as seem to us to be
suggested by the Pictures themselves, after a careful study of the Exhibition—without
reference to the Catalogue.
No. 1. Louisa StARR. “Twinkle, twinkle, little stann,
How I wonder what you are—
But jºy the subject is “two young Ladies puzzled by an acrostic.”
No. 8. C. E. PERUGINI. This #. with powder, and requires no puff.
No.9. ExBE CRowe, A. Extraordinary scene in a Ritualistic Church. A Lady turned
out of her pew by Churchwardens.
No. 14. FRANK DICKSEE. It is called “Harmony.” Judging from the subject, the old
song of “Direy's Land” evidently applies.
“On the second floor, for evermore
I’d live and die with NANCY.”
Thº; Lady at the organ is NANCY. The region of Harmony is clearly DICKSEE's Land.
, No. 105. T. FAED, R.A. “This pig went to market, this stayed at home,”, &c. (This
picture, is a Yery great favourite with the Ladies, who seem to understand what “Little
Cold Tooties” means, but at the same time expend a vast amount of sympathy on the
buxom mother.)
at §2. Bouverſe GoDDARD. Curious effect of the Music of the Future on the animals
700.

No. 118. L. ALMA-TADEMA, A. Turkish

nuts four a penny. - -
No. 110. G. A. STOREY, A., “Living
'Apple-ly.” (This subject ought to have
been chosen by MR, ORCHARDSON.) -
No. 129. EngAR, GIRoRNE. The merit
of this picture is that it does tell its own
story. It represents a little girl, evidently
saying to herself, ‘I ºr. that nasty insect
won't get into my bowl of milk.”. It will
surprise no one to learn that it is intended
for “Little Miss Moffet” of the Nursery
Rhymes.
No. 134. KATE PERUGINI.” Utile e dol-ce.

THE SEA-LIONS' DREAM.
THE Brighton Aquarium's in arms! The

And come up with his eyes all the brighter,
, although, it may be, all the redder.
His father and mother are planning a glo-
rious future for baby-
Though their dream of high-reaching ambi-
tion is clouded as yet with a may-be.
Is it true that the old British Lion is turned,
as some say, a land-lubber,
To the grief of BRITANNIA's heart? Why
not go, tell her no more to blubber,
And, phocine for feline, propose as her
natural guardian to send her
This British-born whelp-a Sea-Lion, in
place of the dry-land pretender?

With man or beast ne'er tampers to $.
Dishonest Touts all betting-men disown:
And by sound judgment make their “books” alone.

AN Occasional Correspondent of the Times in a recent
“gush” over the PRINCEss of WALEs's visit to Athens,
thus begins his description of her visit with the King to

patron saint of Greece as of Éº:-
“It was a high day and a holyday. The sun which shone upon
it received a royal salute on rising at noon, and again as it sank
behind the mountains of the Morea.”
No wonder Greece is behindhand in most things, if
her sun in May only gets up at noon! Better the sun of
Hellas should set for ever, than set such a bad example.

Drather' (That's Missis.) I'd arranged, as well to you beknown is,
With my young man and LIZA ANN, the SMITHs, and the MALONEYs,

I do assure you, SUSAN JANE, the whole turn-out was proper,
A noliday as promised fair to be a true #. :
None of your paltry, cotton-print and billycock collections,
But all the height o' fashion and the werry fust connections.
I’d bought the loveliest laylock silk, the sweetest primrose bonnet—
But there ! 'Twill drive me right down mad if I go brooding on it.
Which jest at the last moment, when all things was adjusted,
Missis goes and puts her foot in it—I thought I should a busted'
Ascuse the metafore, Susan JANE, it's unpoetick, slightly,
But when a party's º down riled 'tis hard to speak politely.
Which riled I was, and all along of Missis's onreason

In course I know her little game. To settle that Miss CLARA

But holidays is holidays to Ladies in our station;
So I shall take the earliest chance to leave this situation.

Ah, well! I know my 'ARRY's heart a Certain One is fixed"on;
Yet still one can't quite picter all without an innard groaning,

THERE's an erudite man,
Whom 'twould be a good plan
For the City to render its Freeman.
Who his fortune has made,
By the grocery trade,
That distinguished explorer, HeRR
SCHLIEMANN
In the Grocer's guild Hall,
As he told the guests all–
With his hosts to knit sympathy closer—
In the speech made to thank,
His health when they drank,
He had twenty-eight years been a Grocer!
He at Mecklenburgh had,
As a young 'prentice lad—
What a boast for explorer to utter—
Sold red-herrings, retail,
And, at hap'orths to sale
Put up rum, sugar, coffee, and butter.
Thence had risen by degrees,
But, whilst dealing in teas,
And attentive to that occupation,
Had with business combined
Steady culture of mind,
And assiduous self-education.
'Twas his habits of trade
Speculation well-wei hed,
Tact and system in sale and in purchase,
That bore such rich fruit
In his later pursuit
Of ancient Homeric researches.
Else he never had found
Such things underground:
Unless he a Grocer had been he,
roy had ne'er disinterred,
Or revealed all we’ve heard
Of the treasures and tombs at Mycenae.
Then for Grocers hooray!
Was not that a proud day,
When, to Grocery's glorification,
SCHLIEMANN made such a treat,
Brother Grocers to greet
In the Hall of their great Corporationſ
WHAT THE UPAs Thre KEEPs DEEPEST
Hold BY.—Its Tap-root.
Q. Why did the natives receive the invaders with open arms, and
hail them as their deliverers? -
A. Because the Governor-General for the time being (ROBERT,
LoRD Lytton) had published a portion of his Poems in Hindustani,
and had threatened to publish the remainder.
Q. How did the Russians finally establish their authority in
Great Britain P
A. By suppressing the Pall Mall Gazette and Daily Telegraph,
and, making special arrangements with the British Army, the
British Fleet, and all the English Railway Companies.
Q. What became of the British Colonies in 1878?
A. By advice of the Colonial Office they annexed one another.
Q. What was the position of France, Austria, and Germany at
this conjuncture?
A. They had been successively absorbed by Russia.

A. She had sunk to the rank of a Russian dependency, after first
establishing the CzAR as Russian Pope at the Vatican.
Q. You have described in outline the marvellous advancement of
Russia. Of course this cost money. How was this money raised?
A. By Foreign Loans.
Q. How did Russia pay off these Loans?
A. By composition with her creditors.
Q. At what rate? -
4. i.º. than a farthing in the pound. ..
Q. How did these wonderful feats come to be practicable?
A. Because JoHN BULL, BRITANNIA, the British Lion, all the
Corps Diplomatiques, the World generally and the nations. of
Europe in particular, the whole of the Weasel Family, including
the ever-wakeful Mr. Punch, happened, unluckily, all to be caught

minster, the seat of
Her Majesty's Govern-
ment, and W. E. G.
at Birmingham, the
head-quarters, for the
moment, of Her Ma-
jesty's Opposition.
From the elected to the electors is an appeal known to the 8.
—though the regular way of making it is by the head of the Govern-
ment, and not the head of the Opposition, “going to the country.”
Those who don't like this sort of appeal call it “stumping.” The
Pall-Mall goes further, and calls it “stumping down” to the folly
and froth of the masses; the Daily News and Punch call it
“stumping up” from interest to principle, from the lower terrors
of the Upper Tens to the loftier convictions of the Lower Millions.
All depends on the point of view: If, as the D.T. and the
P. M. keep on asserting with as much iteration as if they felt the
need of reassuring themselves, as well as their readers, the
.* of the nation is with LoRDs BEACONSFIELD and DERBY, and
against W. E. G. and the DUKE of ARGYLL on this question, why
don't they send the biggest of their big wigs on the stump too, and
try to raise London or Edinburgh, Glasgow or Liverpool, Man-
chester or Leeds, Bradford or Birmingham, to a declaration in
favour of the Russophobe, and Turcophil view of the matter, as
enthusiastic, whole-hearted, and unequivocal, as this of Birming-

Hall, in favour of the view taken by GLADSTONE and those who
think as he does—that the Government have come º
and helplessly to grief between the two stools of intervention an
non-intervention; that they have gone just far enough in inter-
meddling to estop them from using their sole plea of the inde-
pendence of the Turk; that by their paltry, petty, peddling
of words without weight, remonstrances without earnestness, an
representations with no determined purpose behind the varnished
mask of their diplomacy, they have º the Turkin his obsti-
nacy, roused and justified the distrust, and incurred the contempt
of Austria and Germany, Italy and France, thrown the game into
the hands of Russia, and after º her into a war which a bolder
and a braver policy would have rendered unnecessary, put her in
the best position for dictating the terms of peace when that war
shall come to an end—given her the credit of having done, dared,
and sacrificed all that has been done, dared, and I, in
the cause of the misgoverned Christian subjects of the Turk; t,
in a word, they have done everything * ought not to have done,
and left undone all that they ought to have done; while so far
from Russia showing as yet any disposition to attack or interfere
with British interests, she has shown the most cautious determination
to . ect them in the widest construction of which the words are
capable.
That is about the sum and substance of the Gladstonian indict-
ment, and on that W. E. G. has arraigned the Government, in
Stephen's first, and at Bingley Hall afterwards. The case has been
heard, tant bien que mal, at Westminster, and has ended in a verdict
for the Government. But there is an appeal from the Lower Court
of Westminster to a Higher Court of Appeal—that of Public Opinion,

words-words”—with no more kernel of meaning than can be got
out of the assurance that when it came to settling the terms of
#. he presumed we should have a voice in them. It is to be
oped so. At any rate we may trust to LoRD DERBY, in any such
deliberations, to represent England bravely—upon paper.
Then Lord ELCHO proceeded to air his º of war, and
our unpreparedness for it, but was called to order for irrelevancy, proh
pudor / by the O'Donoghue. LoRD ELCHO being by the SPEAKER
pronounced irrelevant, sat silent—if not corrected—through a dis-
cussion-raised by MR. DILLwYN—on the national importance of
telegraphic communication between Lundy Island and the adjacent
island of Great Britain. Can the price of granite and guillemots'
eggs be matters of much national moment? Or is it of the *ś.
of hostile fleets and invading armies that Lundy Island is to whisper
to Great Britain in lightning—if not in thunder P
That matter disposed of, LoRD ELCHo got up to cleanse his stuffed
bosom of the perilous stuff that weighs upon his heart, touching
England's §º for war, and said his say, till even MR.
HARDY told him he had better have held his tongue. To have been
rebuked for too much out-spokenness by the out-spoken Secretary
for War is a distinction LoRD ELCHO ought to value.
MR. HARDY said, that with the fullest sense of his responsibility,
he had kept our forces on the peace footing, but not without looking
to the possible contingency—not, he believed, a probable one—of war.
(But who can say what may happen with such a peace-loving,
war-hating, non-committal Foreign Secre as LORD, DERBY 1)
Then the House went into Supply on the Civil Service Estimates,
and the cheese-parers–RYLANDs, MELLOR, and SIRGEORGE BALFourt
as lively as Mother Carey's Chickens on a dirty night—went in at
everything, from the salary of the Lord Privy Seal to the costs of
Inspectors, of , all sorts, and sizes-Mining, Factory, Poor-Law,
Sanitary, Vaccination—till, at last, PARNELL brought things to a
reductio ad absurdum by moving to reduce by £10,000 the vote for
the expenses of Waccination, and had the pleasure of dividing—
2 (himself and the faithful BIGGAR) to 115. - - - - - -
If Economy is to be made contemptible, commend us to its most
prominent advocates in the present House of Commons. MR. DoD-
son ought to know better than allow his respectable name to figure
in such company. -
MR. MELLOR brought the cheese-paring and candle-end business
to a climax of contemptibility by moving to strike of £530 (for coals
oils and candles supplied to certain offices) out of the £37,895 aske
for the Office of Works.
MR PARNELL stopped the desultory discussion at half-past twelve,
on the £24,000 wanted for Secret Service Money. , Ah, my worthy
pair of obstructives, there is one appropriation from the amount
asked under that name that would not be grudged—but perhaps it
would want a bigger vote to do it, so Punch will not work out the
"ß -
e House, then scuffled, half-a-dozen Bills through various
stages—one of them, the Bill for securing some State superinten-
ence for the wretched Women and Children of our Canal-boat
savages (for which they may bless MR. GEORGE SMITH, of Coalville
first, and MR. CRoss r him)—and finally broke up, with the happy
consciousness of a first of June weii begun, at half-past one.
Friday.--Till the Government has made up its mind how dee
it will dip into JoHN BULL's pocket to pay for Harbour-making, an
when it has raised the money where it will spend it, it is little use
for LoRD C. HAMILTON or MR. BRASSEY to press the claims of Filey
to have a Million spent on º it into a Harbour of Refuge;
or for MR. PEASE to . that if a Million is to be spent on Harbour-
making, Tees-Bay is the place; or for MR. FRESHFIELD to urge the
same claim for Doyer. Every Member is bound, of course, to

FROM THE OLD OBADIAH TO THE YOUNG OBADIAH.

lowtaiwiwg some valuable Instruc-
tion for Youth.)
MY DEAR YoUNG OBADIAH,
IT gives me, as your
Uncle and adviser, great plea-
sure to think that you have
netted a considerable sum by
acting upon the strong recom-
mendation conveyed to you in
my last letter. Silvio was my tip
in private to you, as you well
remember; and I cannot yet be-
lieve that you should have al-
lowed almost a week to pass by
without acknowledging your gratitude to one who dandled you as a
babe on his knee, and who has been more than a parent to you since
you were left, by circumstances over which no one seemed to have
any control, on my hands. Your father, my brother-in-law, may
return in a few years' time, or he may not. Facts are stubborn
things, and his attempt to set up a resemblance between himself
and me—which, however, signally failed, as I was in court at the
time, and in a position to personally instruct the prosecution—was
unworthy of his undoubted but generally misdirected genius,
Send a P.Q. order, my dear boy (not cheque, *...* not cheque),
to your old Uncle, in his retirement, and never forget that a blessing
awaits those who are kind and charitable to their aged relations.
Recollect it was through me that 3. won your money. I trust to
hear from you by return. My address is legibly written at the top
of this letter. And now, my dearest Nephew, let me make a
few general remarks. You are commencing your career, and will
benefit by my experience.
That you should have been offered a seat on LoBD NEwdell's
coach, gratified me extremely: though, at the time, you were unaware
that f was of the party. It was your first appearance as a Noble
Spºrtsman, and, I am glad to say, you did credit to our family name
and ancient reputation. Your white hat and white overcoat were
nearly faultless; but my fortunate discovery that Noses's ticket
(marked “30s.”) was still adhering to the skirt, was a bit of fore-
sight on my part worth a fifty-pun' note to you on such a day, and
in such company.
But, correct as you were, and even imposing as was your appear-
of an old º observer like myself, you gradually fell off
towards the boots, which, like the gaiters and the trousers, were
evidently relics of a bygone and unsporting age. My º don't
half do anything. Be dressed up to the “nines” exactly, but not
merely up to the four-and-a-halfs or even the fives. Also, not
a fraction over the nines. Your hat, your coat (when buttoned,
mind), your tie, and your gloves were alide rigueur for the Derby.
But }. were only attired for sitting down with your legs hidden,
and had not reckoned on walking about the Course, or on being
pilloried on the box of the drag, or on a corner seat at the back.
Werbum sat. - -
I was pleased to notice that if you have not a fund of entertaining
conversation at command, yet you are possessed of an inexhaustible
store of good-humour, and have much control over, your facial ex-
pression, as was proved by the really amiable smile you, assumed
immediately after being struck sharply, and unexpectedly, in the
left eye by a well-directed pea, just as you were ogling, in a most
significant but inoffensive manner, a beautiful creature in lemon
gloves and a blue feather, reclining in the barouche at our side.
By the way, if you must ogle, you should practise, it before a
looking-glass. To ogle as a well-bred gentleman should ogle, is an
art you have yet to acquire. At present, my dear boy, you only
leer, and it is not a pleasant sight. "I will send you a little book
on the subject, entitled The Modest Ogler. Your jokes, if not
absolutely brilliant, were quite equal to those of your companions,
and were intelligible to the meanest capacity. As, for instance,
when, on reaching the “Cock,” young Dick SQUIFFIE (do not forget
that though he is only Dick Squiffie now, he will be one of the
greatest swells in these British Isles) asked you, “Is this Sutton?”
and you quickly replied, “Why, yes, sution:ly! ” It was a ve
fair specimen of the kind of humour to which I have already alluded.
It rather lost on repetition, but will, if kept in reserve, come out
once again quite fresh for next year's Derby. For my part, I hate
jokes and detest puns; but on a Derby Day, when politics are out
of the question, and you’ve got your money on, why dulee est dissi-
pere in 70co. -
Your subsequent performance on, a fog-horn, and your playing
with squeaking dolls, which you had purchased on the race-course,
were not, perhaps, in the best possible taste; but you had had quite
enough iobster salad and champagne, and the sun had been, I
admit, uncommonly strong. Besides, your companions—as many
of them, at least, as still remained on the drag—were not in such a
state as would have given weight to their observations, even when
intelligible. - - - -
The last thing I saw of you was that you were engaged in kissin
your hand to a bevy of elderly damsels in avan, before you succum
to drowsiness, when you reclined on the roof, and slept with your
head in a hamper. As the grooms were looking after you, I retired
** to the interior of the coach, and meditated on the events of
the day. -
Take these remarks in good part, my dear boy, as I am anxious
for R. in your new career. It isn't often that a nephew has an
Uncle who not only knows the ropes, but knows where to draw.the
line; and every line I send you is worth its weight in bullion.
A propos of bullion, do not forget P.O. order for per-centage on the
Silvio tip, for which you have to thank
Your ever affectionate Uncle,
THE OLD OBADLAH.
P.S.–Not a word to your Aunt. I respect her scruples.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
Reports to the Editor, after visiting the Lyceum, the Gaiety, and
the Opera.
SIR,--There is a portent in the theatrical world. MR. CHARLEs
READe, author of The Wandering Heir and The Scuttled Ship, has
given us an exciting melodrama whose sole fault, in the eyes of
an appreciative public, is—its brevity! - -
The Lyons Mail, as the new version is called, is, in some respects,
an improvement on the former one written by MR. READE for the
Princess's in CHARLEs KEAN's time. For instance, much more in this
present piece is made of Julie, Lesurques' daughter, of Jeannette,
Dubose's wife, and of Jerome, Lesurques' father, than in the former
adaptation. But these characters, it seems to me, have been
*ś. somewhat at the expense of the dual parts of Lesurques
and Dubose, both forcibly played by MR. IRVING. MR. READE, how-
ever, has given us an additional scene between Jerome and his son,
which is at once the most powerfully, written and most admirably
acted scene of the play; and here, while the weight of the dialogue is
borne by MR.T. º (whose performance of old Jerome is excellent
throughout), the force of the acting, of varying emotions increasing
in painful intensity at every moment, is entirely in the hands of
MR. IRVING, and, to my mind, this “bit” is the best thing he has

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ever done. Those who have seen his bye-play in Richard the Third
while listening to Margaret's curse, can form some idea of how
this artist would develop his part in such a situation as this, where
innocent of crime, he is accused by his own father of murder and of
attempted parricide, and, finally, is upbraided by him as a coward,
because he refuses to commit suicide, in order to save the family
name from the ignominy of the scaffold.
The change from Lesurques to Dubosc is startling. MR. IRVING's
Dubose might bear a little toning down—a slight graduating where
the outlines of Dubose and Lesurques touch, so that there should be
more blending of the physique of the two characters. Sharplittle boy
Joliquet, at the Inn, would, probably, have distinguished between the
amiable, smiling traveller and the rough, gruff, scowling brute who
addresses him within two minutes after the first has left. True
that the wife, Jeannette, has been deceived by the close resem-
blance of º to Dubosc, but then she ºi. to what she
#. to be his disguise in “fine clothes” at his house on the
Boulevard Montmartre. Joliquet, the boy, has not had time, or
opportunity, to consider this, and I think a point has certainly been
lost by MR, IRyING in not making in this scene, at all events, some
more marked, but, purely accidental, resemblance in dress_and in
arrangement of hair, between Dubosc and Lesurques; such, I mean,
as would naturally induce not only Joliquet's mistake, but also
that of Jerome, Lesurques' father.
Miss Isabel, BATEMAN has never been seen to greater advantage
than as Jeannette, the wife of Dubosc ; and as for Mrss WIRGINLA,
she was a perfect picture of the fashion under the Directory.
I cannot dismiss this without recurring to an admirably studied
point in MR. IRVING's Dubosc. In his dealings with the gang the
Actor never loses, sight of his being “the Captain.” He arranges
the plan of the robbery of the mail, he disposes his forces with as
much decision as Richard showed on the eve of Bosworth. Then
on the º: Dubosc is cool and collected. His enormous draughts of
brandy have had no effect on his head or his hand. He takes º
his vantage-ground as if it were a quiet corner in a battue, an
quietly has a pot-shot at the guard * driver. As he has arranged
it, so he garries it out. The other robbers fumble and fuss. He
becomes impatient with their mode of doing business; his idea
clearly is that, after all, collaboration in such a crime is almost
useless, and that, if you really want a thing well done, you had
better by far do it yourself. The only accomplice at all necessary
to him is Durochat, the traveller in the mail, played by a gentle-
man appropriately named MR. HELPs—and this Mister, helps con-
siderably. In the last Act, where it is all Dubosc-Dubosc drunk,
mad, delirious with *. joy at the prospect of seeing the
innocent suffer for the guilty, fiendish as Quilp, brutal as Macaire
to Jacques Strop (who finds a parallel in Fouinard, carefully played
by MR. J. ARCHER), and, †. Dubosc, like some wild, animal at
bay, desperately struggling for existence—MR, IRVING gives such a
icture as will never ; effaced from the spectator's memory. The
rutality of this scene is so *...* that I do not wonder at the
hearty cheer which arose from the house at the re-appearance of
MR. IRVING as the noble, honest, gentle Lesurques, to replace the
wretch whom they had seen, but a few seconds before, hide behind
the door, prepared to sell his life dearly. That The Lyons Mail is a
real success goes without saying.
Across the road to the Gaiety is but a step. Here the French
company was, last week, playing L’Ami Fritz, and, though the
artistes, headed by M. FREDERIC FEBVRE and MLLE. ALICE LODY,
come from the Comédie Française, from the Ambigu, the Porte St.
Martin, the Châtelet, the Gymnase, the Odéon, and the Gaîté,
the ensemble of the performance was as perfect as if they had been
all playing together for the last fifty nights. That L'Ami Fritz
lacks incident and action, everyone interested in the French Stage
knows by this time. But, though to my mind there is too much
harping on one string, it is a refreshing piece, with an air of the coun-
try breathing about it, and its success in Paris afforded pleasant and
not needless proof that thoroughly good acting, an intelligent choice
and unvulgar treatment of even small and unexciting, incidents,
and natural dialogue, will carry a simple and pure story to a trium-
º: issue. The speeches are perhaps occasionally too lengthy,
ut then these occur invariably in the Rabbi's part, who is profes-
sionally a preacher. MLLE. ALICE Lody, as sweet Suzel, like too
many French ingénues, is just a thought too ingenuous;, she has a
way of “primming” up her lips, a little too suggestive of “prunes.”
and “prism.” The thought will intrude that she is not altogether
too innocent to have conceived the idea of trapping Friend Fritz,
and the thought naturally follows, how long will it be before he
repents of his matrimonial plunge, and justifies the ridicule of his
old bachelor chums? -
M. FREDERIC FEBVRE as Friend Fritz was inimitable; while
MADAME MAEs, as the old housekeeper Catherine, and MADAME
GoDIN, in Lisbet the maid, small as the parts may be, are the
very persons represented, and help out the completeness of the per-
formance most materially. - -
M. FEBVRE's Marcel—in the piece which we have had Englished in
at least two forms—is a wonderfully pathetic and powerful pre-
sentment of a mind shattered by a great sorrow, and the acting
throughout was in startling contrast with what we have seen in the
English adaptations of the little drama.
MR. HollingsHEAD gives us a long list of French plays in pro-
spect, with first-rate artistes to act in them.

At Covent Garden, PATTI's Zerlina, in Don Giovanni, was, as
usual, a triumph. On the Tannhäuser night, RICHARD WAGNER
and MADAME MATERNA were in the house, but RICHARD (who seemed
quite himself again) left after the second Act. Arºnt was charm.

did, that when the projectors of the Gazette took its name from
THACKERAY, they wished to be understood as taking also the cha-
racter he had coupled with it. It is true they have done their best
of late to remove this impression by the rabidness of their attacks
on those who differ with them about the Eastern Question, and
the recklessness with which they ascribe motives, and attach abusive

I’m quite agreeable. So fire away, and I trust your orations will
be reported to your entire satisfaction in to-morrow's papers.
Reply to the Leo-Hunters.
My pushing Friends,-You are most anxious to have the showing
of this child among the Lions of the Season. I should have sup-
posed the Zoological Gardens the rightest place for an exhibition of
the animal in question. However, as “living celebrities” are a
step in advance of “old china,” in the way of rational interest, I
have concluded to come and be stared at in as many drawing-rooms
as I can find time and temper for. Only don't crowd a feller out of
all elbow-room when the hot weather comes—if there’s any on the
road—or I shall think it's White House over again.
Speech at a City Banquet.
Gentlemen, -It has given me great pleasure to assist at your
almighty big feed. I hear that it has been proposed to ask Parlia-
ment to look into the way you spend your revenues... All I can sa
is, that if you are as spry on your duties as on your dinners, I thin
it will be hard to make out a case against you.
Reply to several Deputations of Rival Home-Rulers.
Representatives of a down-trodden Race,—You have done me
the honour to bullyrag JoHN BULL for the glorification of UNCLE
SAM. Since I came I have watched your conduct in the British
House of Commons, and I should think from what I’ve seen of the
Home-Rulers in that location that the Irish House will be a lively
school of oratory, and an almighty smart place of business, when
you get it. In our country we know a thing or two about the worth
of the Irish Agitator and the weight of the Irish vote. However, I
shall be happy to reciprocate—especially with, the Major. My
liquor is old Bourbon, but I’ve no objection to John Jamieson.
Oration to the Citizens of London in General.
Good-natured Cusses, -You have shouted after me till you are
hoarse, and crowded me up till I feel as limp as a Fourth of July
Orator, or a Senator on the stump. But so you did that all-fired
savage the SHAH; and so you would, I guess, any big bug that came
among you. However, Irish Editors and Rative Spread-Eaglers
notwithstanding, it’s a fact your right-down American cousins do
kind of cotton to the British branch of the family, and I see no
reason to doubt that you Britishers will really like us if you ever
come to our real grit. And why shouldn't we like each other? We’ve
one tongue, one past of famous men and glorious associations, one
future of rational progress and law-abiding liberty...We’re pretty
much made to the same gauge, and of the same scantling.
So, on behalf of the Young Giant I represent, I beg to thank the
Old Mother Country for my reception. I .. areas well pleased
with your guest, as he has every reason to be with his entertainers,
and that we shall neither of us be such darned fools as to quarrel on
our own account, or such gonies as to let any set of mean cusses
drag us into a row on theirs. That's about the whole of what I’ve
got to say—except good-bye, and God bless you!
GRAWE MISDEMEANOUR.
ConcIDENTLY with the “Penge Mystery,” there appears to have
occurred a similar “mystery” in the Isle of Wight, wherein the
Times refers as follows to an alleged
“Case of STAR’vation.—With regard to the case of alleged starvation
in the Isle of Wight workhouse, about which a question was lately put in the
House of Commons, the guardians yesterday received a letter from the Local
Government Board, stating that the evidence before them confirmed the effect
of the verdict at the coroner's inquest that deceased died from starvation;
Two nurses are disc the master is censured, the medical officer requested
o resign, and his deputy debarred from further employment in any similar
capacity.”
This is very severe. If, for the alleged starvation of a mere
pauper, officials are actually censured and even sent about their
business, no wonder that people accused of having starved a respect-
able person are committed to take their trial for murder.
Imperfect Accoutrements.
A DAILY contemporary—not an Irish one-animadverting on the
unreadiness of the British Army observes that:-
“For want of those pence, shillings, and pounds, in which England
abounds more than any other country, we find our soldiers are few, that they
have no gaiters and no buttons to them.”
This is a little too hard upon the War Office. How could the
troops possibly have any buttons to no gaiters?
A Query from the Danube.
ToRPEDo, of the future's naval task,
Has won the Master's place. Should proof be needed,
To whom but to a Master, Punch would ask,
Is power to blow up Monitors conceded?

SABBATH-BREAKING.
Scotch Cook. “WHIs HT | THERE's MASTER WHUSTLIN’ o' The SAUBATH ! Losh

A WOICE FROM “ GIB.”
WE are, thank Heaven, familiar in these days with all sorts of kindly
movements for all sorts of improvements in the lot of all sorts of people, from
Cabmen and Costermongers upwards. But few classes have profited more by
this kindliness of the time than our Soldiers. In our home harracks reading
and recreation-rooms, but lately altogether unknown, are now the rule rather
than the exception. On Stations abroad, as such resorts for leisure hours are
more needed than at home, Punch had supposed that they were quite as common
as in British barracks. What was his surprise to learn, the other day, that
there is no such thing as a soldiers' reading and recreation-room at Gibraltar,
with its garrison of more than five thousand men, its oppressive climate, its
temptations to vice and excess, and the exclusion of its garrison from most of
the out-door amusements accessible to the soldier at home and in our more
temperate colonies and dependencies 1
here is a movement on foot for supplying this strange sin of omission,
which Punch presumes has but to be known to be put an end to. A “Gib.
cat” is a recognised symbol of melancholy, and a “Gib. soldier” is not the
i." a man would choose to convey the idea of joyousness. . But though the
Rock is not a “quartiere allegro,” any more than the Rock is a joyous news-
paper, under the best of circumstances, the cut of its jib would be materially
improved by an “Institute,” (if that imposing word is the right one to use of a
modest place of resort for the soldier when off duty,) with reading and recrea-
tion-rooms where he can join in unobjectionable games, and a coffee and
refreshment-room where he can empty any number of the cups that cheer but
not inebriate. For his own part, Punch sees no objection to the provision of
wholesome beer or light wines as well. But probably the canteen-keepers have
a vested monopoly in these, within barrack bounds, and would object to the
granting of any licence for even the wholesomest form of tipple on which a man
could get drunk even under the most insuperable difficulties.
Punch has only had to receive notice of such a want to give it the benefit
of his world-wide rooti-too-it, and to add that donations may be sent to the

A POET ON SPELLING.
“I am not afraid of ridicule, and I have a strong opinion on
the spelling question. I cannot be present at your meeting, but
you are quite welcome to my opinion. There are, I am in-
formed, thirty-nine sounds in the English language. There are
twenty-four letters. I think that each letter should represent
one sound, that fifteen new letters should be added, so that there
be a letter for every sound, and that every one should write as
he speaks.-Mr. Lowe's Letter read at the Conference on Spell-
iny Reform, held at the Society of Arts, Adelphi..
RASH man, refrain! These are momentous times
For poets. Muffs are meddling with our rhymes.
Is 't not enough that measure's set aside,
And every ancient rule of rhythm defied,
By that amorphous lunatic WALT WHITMAN,
But that the likes of MR. Is AAC PITMAN
Must make a raid on rhymes, and CADMUs-Low E
Add fifteen brand-new letters at a blow
To our redundant alphabet? Thirty-nine!
An ominous number. Ask ashrewd divine.
'Twill tend to strife if the phonetic particles
Are made co-numerous with the Church's Articles.
The very prospect fills me with affright; .
I’ve now an inkling when my rhymes are right,
But right from wrong I’m sure there’ll be no telling,
If PITMAN plays the mischief with our spelling;
What pleasure would e'en MILTON's muse afford,
His spells reshaped by an ARTEMUs WARD !
Wouſd gentle readers waste their sighs or shillings
On Bykon, if phoneticised by BILLINGs f
What bard would care to write of Love, if he
Were bound to spell it with an l-u-vº
Who’d pipe of ladiesi's? Who’d not refuse
To invoke a crabbéd creature called the Müz?
And where's the amorous bard could be so stupid
As chant the praises of a god named Qpid?
Absurd ' Methinks on poet's page I gaze, .
No fair trim garden, but a tangled maze
Of typographic tongue-traps. And for what?
To save young spellists trouble! Horrid rot!
MüLLER may mouth, and BIKKERs vaunt how much
Our spelling falls below his crackjaw Dutch:
PITMAN may swear “e-a” defies all law—
(His favourite vocable should be “e-haw l’’);
ELLIS may make his “Glossic” system known,
And Sweet be very sweet upon his own;
'Tis nice to know the rival }. clash—
ne hopes the tilt may end in general smash)–
It will not do. Bards must not have their lines
Defaced by diacritic marks and signs
Or spoilt by comic spelling. fearned bores,
Drive not the sickened Muses from our shores!
They can put up with doubtful etymology,
They do not care a fraction for philology,
But they must leave Old England, with regret,
If Lowe lays hands upon her Alphabet;
And far from the Ade º make their dwelling,
If PITMAN sets his spell upon her spelling.

AN EXPLANATION.
THE Editor of London begs Punch to remove an im-
pression which the Editor thinks may be left by a para-
graph in a late “Essence of Parliament,” that a parody
on WoRDsworth’s “We are Seven,” quoted by the
CHANCELLOR of THE ExCHEQUER, in the debate on MR.
GLADSTONE's Resolutions, had been actually sent to Punch
and rejected by him. What Punch meant was not that
the parody had been consigned to his waste-paper-basket,
but that it was of the quality that usually finds its way
to that well-filled receptacle. He thought when he wrote
this that the lines were SIR STAFFORD NoHTHCOTE's own.
he known they had actually appeared in London
he would have guarded himself more carefully against
the misinterpretation which has been put on his very
innocently meant bit of chaff.

MORE INJURIOUS INSECTS.
LAST week a Conference was held, at the rooms of the Society of
Arts, on Insects injurious to Agriculture. After much useful dis-
cussion, it was decided that the Privy Council should be requested
to take the matter into serious consideration with a view to the sup-
pression of the objectionable parasites. Mr. Punch ever ready to
take a valuable hint likely to be of service to his fellows, suggests
that a Conference should also be held on insects just as injurious to
society'as the Phyllorera to the vine, or the Colorado Doryphorus
to the potato. He subjoins a few examples of the most noxious
genera of these social insect-plagues.
The Home Hornet uses its very virulent venom in stinging all
it comes in contact with. Its poison, of which the principle is the
intensely acrid Sarcasma malitiosum, has been known to produce
yery serious effects on nervous and weakly temperaments. . Luckily
it is as cowardly as it is offensive, and so may be easily fº.
off for the moment, but only to resume its annoyance on the first
opportunity. - -
he Visiting Drone. This creature is almost singular in creation,
for no one has yet ascertained what useful purpose it serves in the
scheme of the universe. So far as its habits have been studied,
it seems to employ itself entirely in impeding, the labours of
others. With this object it is to be found infesting the rooms of
authors, artists, actors, and other busy people, particularly the
more easy-going and amusing businesses and crafts. When it has
once been allowed to establish a habitat, it will be found most
difficult to get rid of. -
The Friendly Locust. This parasitic insect generally makes
its appearance about meal-times. If not at once supplied with
food, it will stay buzzing about the drawing-room, till it sees the
family on the move for the dining-room, when it will attempt to
follow them. Loaded wine and badly-cooked, food will sometimes
(but by no means always) relieve those who suffer from this
obnoxious and persevering insect. -
The Money-Lending Spider. This horrible creature's favourite
habitatis in º eading out of fashionable thoroughfares.
It also haunts the advertisement columns of the newspapers. It
feeds upon the softer genera of flies, whose blood it sucks with
avidity, and in an incredibly short time. It can be easily detected
by its sixty per cent. -
The Wearisome Worm. This insect infests club-rooms, water-
ing-places, parties, promenades, and indeed all crowded social
gatherings. In such places it is very apt to settle on the arm, or
even, in cases of the bolder species, the button-hole, of its in-
cautious victim. It is difficult to shake off, but its sting is more
irritating than really painful.
The Garrulous Gadfly. This insect has many of the peculiarities
of the Visiting Drone: . During its erratic flight from place to place;
it. º eggs, which afterwards develope swarms of winged
Scandala gossipiensia, an ephemeral insect furnished with an
WOL. LXXI.
ingenious prehensile machinery, besides a peculiarly injurious poison
and a sharp sting. Altogether a creature more formidably equipped
for mischief it would be difficult to find.
The Libellous Flea-Another insect of the Drone order: variety,
vitiosissima. It delights in hopping from place to place, leaving its
characteristic drop of venom as it goes. It is difficult to trace, and
harder to destroy, but no opportunity should be lost of diminishing
the breed of this ever-increasing plague.
And lastly, the Would-be Comic Snail. This creature is about the
most *.*.*.* irrepressible of all insects. Its favourite habitat
seems to be Mr. Punch's waste-paper basket, which it fills with
wonderful rapidity.
Nuda, Veritas.
THE leading Swiss hotel-keepers have formed a league to put down
“vails” to servants...Their wages are to be doubled, and “service”
is to disappear from the travellers' bills. But won't the tips to the
valetaille continue to be expected by them all the same, and to be
paid by the traveller, who will, at any time, bleed by his own hand
rather than put up with the churlish service or chilling looks, an
the humiliating sense that he is regarded as a “mean cuss” by those
who look for his parting franc without getting it: . In that case, the
so-called “doing away with fees to servants,” will be but a new form
of extortion without wails, in other terms, barefaced extortion.

SIR STAFFoRD NoFTHcote having asked for Tuesday Morning
Sittings, does not, for the F. mean to ask for more.
SIR GroRGE Bowy ER asked, but was refused, leave to “heckle”
MR. GLADSTONE on his share in the formation of the Birmingham
National Confederation—in which SIR GEORGE seems to smell a
Brummagem House of Commons.
The Clerical Fellow was, with difficulty, threshed through the
Universities Bill Committee, but not out of the Universities, as at
one moment seemed likely.
MR. Gosch EN moved that the Commissioners should disconnect

not only useless but injurious to the Church, would leave the
Colleges with their clerical heads on.
MR. GLADSTONE liked to see a large clerical element in the teach-
ing ."#. he did not think Clerical Fellowships the right
thing. His speech hazy, and scarce consistent with his vote.
MR, HARDY opposed the clause; LoRD HARTINgtoN supported it.
Fº it was rejected by the narrow majority of 147 to 138.
In the present House such a division sounds the doom of Clerical
Fellows. “No admission by orders” will soon be the rule in the
Universities, as in the theatres when the house can be filled without
being “papered.”
After dinner, SIR C. DILKE revived the discussion of the same
point on another Motion, when it was defeated by 173 to 151.
“No Clerical turnpike-tolls,” will be the rule of the road that
leads to snug College berths, for our grandsons, if not our sons.
“Another Church-bulwark, sapped,” exclaim, those who look
backward to the past. “Another source of Church weakness dried
up,” cry the Liberals who look forward. But it “has to be,” as our
American cousins say, Why should Dissenting wranglers and First-
Class-men be so heavily handicapped in the Oxford and Cambridge

tites for more, by twenty minutes past five. They don't insist upon

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE SKETCHING SEASON,
~ ~
1877.
Sronge's SKETCHING EQUIPAGE-(HE CAN'T WALK ACRoss Country so well. As when HE was YouNGER)—combining CELERITY
witH PRIVACY AND EconoMY.
(Commons, Morning Sitting.)—MEssRs. WHALLEY and Goukſ.EY
much exercised on LoBD DERBY's Suez Canal Despatch. That enfant
terrible, E. JENKINS, in spite of the frown of the SPEAKER and the
howl of the House, wanted explanations before the House had had
time to read the papers, and ... WHITBREAD, a great stickler for
House of Commons decorums, rapped him over the knuckles.
MR. A. EGERTON was instructed to deny the report of a mutiny
aboard the Alexandra—the last ship in the Navy, to judge by her
name, for Blue, Jackets to mutinyin. To be sure, there had been
some extra drill, some dissatisfaction between decks, some mess:
traps and gun-sights thrown overboard, but no mutiny, bless you!
-or if any, like the country girl's baby, “Such a little one !”
“But where there's smoke there's fire”--and guns without sights
might prove, on an emergency, as useless as Admirals without
brains. So perhaps the Admiralty may find it desirable to look
sharply into this little “flare up” aboard the Alexandra.
Consideration of Prisons Bill, as amended. MEssRs. O'ConnoR
PowRR, DB. WARD, MR. PARNELL, MR, WHALLEY, and DR. KENEALY
holding briefs for the convicts, and against the prison officers, as
usual., “A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind.” I shouldn't
like to be a prison officer under a Home-Rule Parliament.
. At the eyening sitting MR. MITCHELL HENRY, to a bored House,
: often-urged theory of the inequalities of English and Irish
anions
SIR STAFFORD NORTHCOTE pointed out, for the twentieth time,
that all the inequalities of taxation between the two countries are
in favour of Ireland, except the spirit duties, and those the Irish
*ś diminish for theme Wes.
hy was the Major silent? And why could MR. HENRY find no
more thirty-four Irish Members to º him on a division ?
No wonder he is savage with his Home-Rule associates, who will
insist on premature rehearsals of the Kilkenny Cat business.
he House was Counted Out at one, while MR, WHALLEY was
calling attention to MR. DE MORGAN's petition to be heard at the
bar, on the “ Hºº'. ” case. Why should the House
sit to hear MR, DE MoRGAN at the bar, when it won't hear poor
MR. WHALLEY from his bench P
Wednesday.—More “wanting to know "what is the exact mean-
ing of the Suez Canal Communications. SIR WILLIAM HARCOURT
ave notice of a question. (For the answer, see Punch's Cartoon,
hat is about the English of it. We have the key of the Canal, and
we mean to keep it—and the locks belonging to it—open, and see that
the water-way is kept for its proper purpose; transit, not fighting.
The admission of Petticoats to Polling-places was hotly discus
till a quarter to six, and then howled out, MR. CourTNEY keeping
his legs against the storm with a courage worthy of the ogcasiºn;
and saving the Bill from a crushing division. The political females
time is not yet. Will it ever come? Cur, adv, vult. Suppose we
relegated the date of the Woman's Wote to that of the Parliament on
Palace Green P
MIDHAT was in the House through the row, and from the Mussul-
man point of view of the stronger sex, must have been much edified.
JAcob BRIGHT was eloquent on Woman's Rights. MR. BUTT, on
the other side, was powerful on the natural relations of the sexes,
and did not want Woman conve from Lady into Lord of Man.
Happy BUTT l if he has not already found Woman, even without a
vote, more than a match for her master!
Thursday.—The Lords on the Scotch Game Laws Amendment Bill.
The MACCALLUM MoREvery wroth with the presumption of the Scotch
tenant in attempting to reverse the presumption of the Scotch law that
the right of killing gameisinthelessor and not the lessee. His Amend-
ment, putting the presumption the other way, was carried by 3 to 36.
It is long since we have seen their Lordships so #. But this
was a great constitutional question—in a House of (Land) Lords.
The LoBD CHANCELLOR moved the Second Reading of his Bar
Education and Discipline Bill. It flows from that quadruple
fountain of light, the Inns of Court, and provides a Council
of Legal Education; twenty-four chosen by the Inns, and six by
the Crown, with an income from the Inns, and power to sit on
black sheep. LoRD SELBORNE admitted it was the small end of
the wedge, deplored it was so small, and liked his own Bill
better. But the Inns of Court didn't; so he would take what he
could get, and hope for the time coming.
Their fordships, having thus rebuked the presumption of Scotch
tenants touching game, and provided for the education and
discipline of the Bar, adjourn in less than two hours. Punch

calls that something like business! Lower Palaver House, go thou
and do likewise.
(Commons.)—Again much exercised about the Suez Canal. (See
ante.) LoRD DERBY has made known England's will in the matter
to the effect that anything or everything may pass through the
Canal, but nobody shall be allowed to stop the way to it, or fight
in it, unless England knows the reason why. How about Turkey's
rights in the matter? Pooh! The independence of the Porte is
one thing, the iº. of the Canal another.
SIR. E. WATKIN having called attention to a dictum of the LoRD
CHIEF J Usrich, in Twycross v. Grant, calling a spade a spade (i.e.,
pronºuncing “rigging the market,” to be but another phrase for
‘getting i. on false pretences”), SIR RoRERT PEEL asked a
question, in effect charging SIR. E. WATKIN with having “rigged
the market” in the case of the Humber Iron Works. SIR. E.
WATKIN replied with †† and effect, pointing out how that case
had, by his act, been fully investigated at law, and his own con-
duct in regard of it cleared of all evil imputation. SIR Robert
should have known better, but he doesn’t, and we presume—after
all the schooling he has had against the bad habit of flinging dirt
—never will.
Then the House, on, the Prisons Bill, struggled for some hours
against DR. KENEALY's, and some of his Irish friends', persistent
attempts to turn the prison tables against the officers, and to make
their treatment penal, instead of their prisoners’.
SERJEANT SIMON's more reasonable Motion for abolition of the
tread-wheel, the crank, shot-drill, and flogging, was negatived by
229 to T2. These punishments are to be kept—if chiefly in terrorem.
The House and the country should be much obliged to MR. CRoss,
not only for the framing, but for the fighting of the Prisons' Bill.
Friday (Lords).-EARL DELAwake (the appropriate Peer) moved
for returns of the killed, and wounded in that but too deadly war-
fare alwaysº on above and underground with the powers of
nature, aided by those formidable allies—ill-governed machinery
and human carelessness. As an appendix, the DUKE of SoMERSET
asked the Board of Trade for information as to the progress of
brake-power—not break-power—on the Railways. The DUKE of
RICHMONP assured my Lords that the Companies are improving their
system of brakeage-again note the spelling—and that the Govern-
ment have their eye on them.
(Commons).-A vast deal of talk, including a “heckling ” of SIR
STAFFORD NORTHCOTE by LoRD Robert Montagu and Mr. WHAL-
LEY, which roused even SIR STAFFORD's practised patience into pro-
test, till, by the united efforts of the House and the SPEAKER, Lond
RoßERT MonTAGU was snuffed out, and MR.WHALLEY silenced.
Then came a miscellaneous rush of questions and answers on all
sorts of subjects, crowned by MR. TAYLOR's defeat (by 229 to 87)—
destined to be a victory some day, and the sooner the better, on
a Motion for the Sunday opening of the National Museums and
Galleries as rivals of the Public-house, now sole sharer of the
leisure of that holy day with Church and Chapel.
LoRD F. HERVEy, MR. Locke, and—Mr. Punch is glad to note—
the RIGHT Hon. W. E. Forst ER, for the first time, pro: Colonel
BERESFORD, MR. MACARTHUR, and MR. W. H. 'SMITH for the
Government, eon. The Treasury has a natural weakness for the
Licensed Victuallers—those roof-trees of the revenue. Still, Clerical
majority at Sion House, Conservative Government and Gin-spinning
interest to the contrary notwithstanding, magnus est sensus com:
munis et prevalebit? hold out, HANSARD (Rev. SEPTIMUs) |
The rest of the night was consumed in a chat on the working of
the Judicature Act, and a desperate struggle of MR...WHALLEY with
the impatience of the House and the patience of the SPEAKER, to get
a hearing for MR. DE MoRGAN's petition, in the course of which the
Member for Peterborough had the pleasure of calling MR. W. H.
SMITH to order! Such a new sensation for him, poor #.
“Put out the Light, and then"—
FROM some provincial jottings we extract the following item of
news :-
... “BRLFAsr.—To-night the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church
in Ireland commenced its annual deliberations in Belfast, when a sermon was
preached by the outgoing Moderator, the Rev. John M'NEELY, Belfast.”
"Outgºing Moderator”. It is to be hoped that he was speedily
extinguished, as, if a moderator is allowed to go out by itself, the
consequences are most unpleasant. But surely a moderator oughtº:
tº be permitted to gº out. A moderator should be “turned down,”
like a collar, or an idle Eton boy.

A SPIRIT-LETTER.
(From MR. Joseph ADDIsoN to his friend, SIR RICHARD STEELE,
from where BUTTON's Coffee-house once stood.)
MY DEAR STEELE, -
SINCE my return to Earth for a brief ºf: of scene, I
have seen many things which were not dreamed of in our more
primitive philosophy, not even in the capacious brain, of our great
SIR. Isaac, to whom, in all humbleness and sincerity, I beg the
favour to be remembered. - -
I have told you in a former letter that the present time prides
itself on being a knowing age, in comparison with whose printed
wisdom the lueubrations of our good ANNA's reign are but as the
babblings of a child to the reflections of a philosopher, But one
point I must mention, in which the present time and the past to
which we belonged show an outward resemblance, which but make
more apparent their inner unlikeness. With MR. DEFor and Ph.
ARBUTHNor, you will probably be, at first, pleased to hear that
the Spectator and Tatler, the Plain Dealer, -
aminer, and all the rest of the eountless brood of *: Ephe-
merae, which sprang to life in our day, have yielded a numerous
progeny— †. in the shape of the many satirical weekly
}. wº have lately sprung or wriggled into being.
But although some of these papers have taken qur names, and
masquerade it in our clothes, there is but little resemblance between
our clean, if narrow, sheets and their broad, but too often #";
Still less can they boast any flavour of the fine humour which lent
a relish to the lightest performances of my dear 8TERIE and the wits
and fine gentlemen who, with him, lashed while they diverted the
town wº. to refine manners and elevate public taste. They
are panders to the most witless excesses of the one, and active
agents in the degradation of the other. They serve up the scandal
of the stable and the servants' hall, or the gossip of the Club, to
tickle the jaded palates of an idle and luxurious mobility, or a
plutocracy which affects their vices without the transmit habit
which half excuses, or the hereditary grace which half redeems
aftsman, and Bæ- |

them; or still worse, to feed the unwholesome appetites of the silly
parvenus or grovelling parasites who, while they at once foster
and ape, the follies of their superiors, love nothing better than tº
3. attention to the weaknesses, expose the inconsistencies, and
eclaim against the vices, which they imitate. - --- -
To stimulate the dull papilla of such readers, plain truth, if it be
ever served up, must be spiced and peppered, and folly in its essence
be made appetising by a sauce piquante. fenners of smart para-
graphs are engaged to circulate scandal in an epigram, and disguise
impropriety in the intricacies of an acrostic or the garnish of a
double entendre. What matter if stories be apocryphal and state-
ments unfounded? They can be corrected, if need be, next week,
and the *; correction will help to give wider circulation to the
falsehood.
Lies, to be forgotten after their nine days' lease of noxious life.
The projectors and conductors of these papers pride themselves on
being what they call “men of the world.” Having grown grey in
London, they lay claim to a special knowledge of that mingled
microcosm. They have experienced most of the failures and decep;
tions of life. They naturally delight to rail or sneer at a world
which, as a rule, has treated them according to their deserts.
Their highest pride is to parade their intimacy with the fre-
quenters of doubtful drawing-rooms, and their freedom of question-
able clubs. Their acme of enjoyment is to be admitted to a back
seat on the least exclusive four-in-hand of the Coaching Club, or
the high privilege of a nod from the Guards' bow-window.
An itch to know the ways and means, the lives and manners of
ublic personages—imported, I believe, from across the Atlantic-
as of late become the mania alike of town and country. ...These
º: are at much pains and cost to describe, with the most offensive
and obtrusive familiarity, and in the pettiest particulars, the homes,
haunts, and habits of all about whom the world can reasonably, or
unreasonably, be supposed to feel curiosity. An effigy at MADAME
Tussaud's (a Waxwº of the town, as noted now as Mrs. Sºmon's
in our own, time), and an article in the Weekly Dust-Bin, seem
at present the chief insignia of the notoriety which passes for fame.
... When such and so guarded are the avenues to popular reputation,
it is hardly to be wondered at that charlatans should be applauded,
and nobodies magnified into importance. When I reflect that these
accounts of living personages are penned either by laudatory and
self-seeking parasites, or * unscrupulous enemies, I find it as easy
to account for the fulsome flattery of the one class of articles as for
the malignant depreciation of the other. The objects of this adula-
tion and objurgation were for a time usually, if not exclusively,
of the male sex; but you will readily understand that a custom
offering such gratifications of vanity should have, ere long, ex-
tended itself to the Ladies of the beau monde. As every Lady
fosters a secret pride in some feature of her face, some trait of her
character, or some peculiarity of her dress or manners, she readily
yields herself an offering on the altar of cheap admiration. So
that my LADY LISPWELL's portrait can now be bought for sixpence
in the streets, or hung at the book-stalls for º puppy to gloat over
or crack his low joke upon. 'Tis true the Ladies are limned in
delicate colours, and with a flattering, if not idealising, touch.
Time was, when women of tºº. fashion boasted a pride,
if not modesty, which would have shrunk from such public exhi-
bition of themselves. But now they seem to sacrifice alike pride
and modesty, so they can but attract attention.
But for the present I must take my leave of you.., MR. DEFoE
will be gratified to learn that the excellent QUEEN who now occu-
F. the throne, and more than rivals our own ANNA in the loyal
ove of her subjects, has granted a life-pension to his three great-
great-granddaughters, thus relieving them from a state of indigence
from which the services of their ancestor, alike to the cause of our
popular literature and our national liberties, had not availed to
preserve them. I remain, my dear STEELE,

“In the Queen’s name, I charge you all to drop
Your swords and daggers.”—Critic.
IN MACLISE's Caxton-picture the printers wear swords, and
though MR. BLADEs, the great Caxtonian authority, asserts that
this practice was never in vogue, it would seem that now-a-days
the manipulators of type are expected to wear daggers, to judge by
the following advertisement from the Daily Telegraph:—
O PRINTERS.–A § able, and reliable Compositor can have

Here a “quiet and reliable” man is offered “regular 'stab em-

ences be indispensable for such a calling P

EDUCATION AND EXTRAS,
THE concluding passage of the police iº below-quoted may
seem to suggest some misgiving as to the kind of education imparted
at ...; schools. At Brentford the other day a youth named
HENRY BAILEY was charged with a deplorable act of mischief; an
assault inflicting remediless injury on a little boy named MCAR'thy,
three years old. Prisoner called to the poor child, told him to
“look him straight in the face,” and when he did so shot him in his
face with a catapult, knocking an eye completely out.
“The Bench considering it a wilful and deliberate act, remanded the
risoner with the view of sending him to an industrial school, where, as the
hairman remarked, he would be taught something else besides knocking
other boys' eyes out with a catapult.”
Is it not rather to be hoped that MASTER BAILEY will be taught
something besides not knocking other boys' eyes out with a catapult?
A Powerful Illustration.
(North British Daily Mail, 8th inst.)
At a recent dinner of the Irvine Farmers' Society, a Member,
roposing “The Agricultural Interests,” said of the frvine Town
ouncil, against which the Farmers' Society seems to cherish a
ievange, “That if a louse was to die on the Irvine Mains Farm
which belongs to them), and you wanted, its skin for bleaching,
before you could bury its carcase you would require to write to the
Council for liberty, and then the letter would require to lie a month
on the table for consideration.”

IT is not merely the experiments now in progress with torpedoes,
and their employment in war, together with that of shells and other

be deemed a specimen of many other reports exemplifying the #
of report to which the denomination “a banger” is applicable:—
*A rumour is current here to-day that Turkey has offered to pay five
milliards as a war indemnity, and allow the Russians to retain the places
captured in Asia. Imerely mention this as a flying report.”
So one would think. Turkish credit must have wonderfully re-
yived, or Turkish cheek be enormous, if it be true that Turkey
has offered to pay five milliards of money. Of course it is merely a
flying report, Wild ducks fly. But to describe the report above,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
A Visit to the Horse Show at the Agricultural Hall and to the
Gaiety for MLLE.
Răsă.
A wonDERFUL place the Agricultural Hall during the Horse
Show. As Your Representative in Sporting Matters, I visited the
Hall on the best day—that is, Thursday. It will be unnecessary for
me to describe the “humours of the road” from Belgravia, through
Bohemia, to “Merry Islington.” Any one acquainted with the
racy character of omnibus and cab-drivers, and the solemnity of the
tramway fº. knows all about it—et cela va sans dire; and, by
the way, I “went without saying anything about it,” so as to prevent
overcrowding. Nobody knew I was there, not even the gallant MR.
SIDNEY, mounted on a charger, and shouting to invisible people to
“Come on!” as though he were challenging outsiders to a joustin the
tented field...The Prince and Princess were there; they entered the
building half-an-hour after I had taken my seat, which I obtained
at some risk by stepping into a new patent cab exhibited as a modei
by the proprietor, who had, at the moment of my arrival, gone from
labour torefreshment with a friend. Awaiter saw me, but I"squared.”
him for sixpence—that is, I gave him a shilling, and asked him to
bring me back the change. I saw that Waiter one again, We met:
'twas in a crowd, and I thought he would shun me. But he didn't:
he smiled., I reminded him that he owed me sixpence. He replied
(with his hands full) that he was just going to get it. He dis-
appeared. I never saw him º However, he kept my secret,
and did not tell the Exhibitor that I was comfortably seated in his
new patent cab. If the Exhibitor, had appeared, I was prepared
with my answer. He would have found in me (for this occasion
only) the Secretary of a New General Patent, Cabbinit Company
}. to try his invention. However, he did not turn up, and
remained the man in possession.
Were I_MR. SIDNEY, the Manager, I would not allow, on the
occasion of a Horse Show, several specimens of new Sausage Ma-
chines to be exhibited at the door. Verhum sap.
I inspected MR. SHANKS's cab, which, of course, can only be
drawn by one of SHANKs's mares. It is a remarkable construction.
ou go one way, and look the other. The passenger, going forward,
looks backwards, and I would suggest that the name of the vehicle
should be “The Lot's Wife Cab,” or it might be called, “ The
Arthur Sullivan,” both distinguished characters being associated
in the popular mind with “Looking Back.”
They’ve a trifle muddled these exhibitions inside the Hall. Next
to a suite of drawing-room furniture is a sheep being sheared by
machinery. A young lady sells a remarkable glove-cleaner, called
Renovo, and not far off, an enthusiastic gentleman behind a counter,
is ladling out patent soup, “all hot,” in a saucepan lid, and temptin
the passers-by to taste and try before they buy. There’s a mode
horse (made of wood, like a towel-horse, or like, the Trojan horse—
the, only one, by the way, where the direction, to “get inside and
pull the blinds down,” could have been literally, observed) “war-
ranted quiet,” and no expense to keep: There's a family fire-engine,
a family freezing machine (the family go from one into the other,
and vice. versá-but what a family!?), and a Patient. Grizzle of a
horse (alive oh!), being clipped and groomed by machinery all day
...; to the intense amusement of admiring crowds of Cockneys, who
evidently thought it was some surgical º generally performed
previous to turning the animal over to the sausage machine outside.
A pervading smell of tan, and an atmosphere of small dust. In
the circus—or rather the oval—the “judges are—a terrible show.”
A distinguished Oriental, in green, was taken by the crowd, who
looked on the whole affair from a circus point of view, for a new
sort of Clown. This idea was favoured by the sudden appear-
ance of a groom, with a white box and a pole stuck in it, of the
same make as the machine generally used by the trick horse that
#. with MR. MERRIMAN, rings the bell, and fires the pistol.
What this was ultimately used for, I do not know. There it re-
mained ºf the entire performance, and nothing was done with
it, at least, while I was looking.
After the Stallions had been trotted round (a performance
encored later in the day for the Prince), a terrific gong sounded,
“All in to begin!” Evidently an Equestrian Pantomime to Harle-
quin and the Forty. Thieves, magnificently mounted, was about to
commence. I looked out anxiously for the large heads. No. Only
some men, dressed in a style something between steamboatstewards
and railway porters, ran in; and arranged the hurdles. Place aur
dames / #...; a Ladies T.e on horseback. No. They are
going to leap those fences. o first do it easily. Number Three
thinks better of it, and sidles round without jumping. Clever horse
this. This is the one that I shouldº the p. to, were I a †".
Number Four first rate. Over! Number Five is a vain fool—the
horse, of course—it steps along with a sideways glance at itself, as
though admiring its own movements in a shop window. Over! Six
is the horse for my money. Six deserves the prize. “Six shall
achieve, Seven deceive,” as Zamiel sang. Six—a very superior
horse is Number Six—does not make the slightest attempt to jump,
nor even to swerve and go round the obstacle. Bravo! That's the
horse for me !
The sort of horse I should hate is the horse that hesitates, thinks
over it, and then suddenly jumps over it. Bravo, Ladies, now then,
all together! Over! All over, and eaceunt omnes. Much applause.
Gong again. This time it must be the Pantomime. No. ow of
Harness Horses. Ezeunt omnes. Gong. Now for the Forty
Thieves on horseback, and the Oriental Gentleman in the centre
will assume the rôle of Abdallah, the Captain of the Forty, after-
wards Clown. Now for the fun! No. Only more leaping—or
rather, more attempts at leaping—for they nearly all of them
knock down either the hurdle or the gate, so that at last my noble
sportsman's blood is up, and from my comfortable seat in the patent
cab I cry out indignantly “Yah!” The crowd take it up...We are
all yahing. Opportunity for chorus: Air, “We’re All Nodding”—
We are all yahing,
Yah, yah, yahing!
Oh, we're all yahing
At th' Agricultural Hall!
I stamp my feet. “Now, Sir!” I cry to a muff who can't get
his horse over the gate. “Now, Sir! Put him at it, Sirl Giye
him his head, Sir Now then, O—ver !” He knocks down the
gate, and all the crowd cry, “Yah!”
What a rage I should be in with the crowd of Yahers, were I
that unhappy man on the horse that won't go. I pity him, but I
“yah” at him, “Get inside, Sir! Take him home to tea, Sir!”
I shouted loudly; when at that moment it struck me that the
gallant veteran GENERAL SIDNEY had caught my . From his
expression I thought it better to—refer to my watch, and finding
that I had overstayed my time by two minutes, I stepped out of the
eab, and gained #. door as quickly as possible. Policeman A. 2
left immediately after me. So did the Prince and Princess. Whether
they had been yahing too, I can’t say. But altogether it was a
slow performance without a Clown—and no brass band and drum!!
Yah!
Talking of music, I went to hear THERísa at the Gaiety. She is
wonderful. Some people might add what DR. JoBNSON said of the
violoncello solo performance. She is La Mère Angot, Junior, sud-
denly inspired d la Bacchante... Her refrains mean as much as the
tol de º: of the old form of comic song chorus. But there are
more ways than one of singing tol de rol, lol. As far as I have
heard, “IRien n'est sacré pour win Sapeur” is her best song. On her
entrance, in the Chansons de Suzon (a mere yehicle for her songs),
THERás A strikes you at once as the very model of one of GREVIN's
cleverly sketched, oyer-coloured_frontispieces to the Journal pour
rire. There's the black patch for the hair, the two black dabs for
the eyes, the over-rougedeyelids, the generally brilliant complexion
and the large mouth. Occasionally she astonishes º her pastoral
sweetness, and the next instant she has startled you by her Seven-
Dials harshness. She can coo like the turtle dove, she can shriek
like the macaw. To like, or not to like, that is a question-of taste.
At all events she is, as the great original of this style of thing, a
celebrity to see.

NEx' Door's Got A ‘LANG'AGE o' FLOWERS BEE,’ AND she's REQUESTED ME to

WISDOM IN WIGS.
QH, MR. PEPys! If, Sir, you citizens of the invisible world take in and
read our newspapers, how immensely you must have been delighted with a
º; in a cent law report of sittings in the Queen's Bench Division at
isi Prius before MR. JUSTICE FIELD! In case you may have missed it, Sir,
here it is; something quite after your own heart:-
“That prevailing uncertainty which characterises the practice and procedure of the
Supreme Court of Judicature has now extended to the question as to what clothes should
be worn on red-letter days. His Lordship appeared this morning in those brilliant robes
which learned judges wear on days which commemorate the birth of HER MAJESTY or
the death of the Saints. On taking his seat, one of Her Majesty's Counsel proceeded to
address him. ... But his Lordship drew attention to the fact that his wig was not of those
dimensions which the solemnity of the day required.”
. Perhaps, Sir, R. were almost as much gratified by this judicial animadver-
sion on a Counsel's wig as you were vexed by a great man's culpable inattention
to your own, in an interview at which you appeared in a new peruke—a piece
of ill-breeding which naturally disgusted you.
As mightily, no doubt, were you edified by the Queen's Counsel's alacrity to
apologise for the undesigned shortcoming of his wig, and his promptitude to
repair that grave deficiency forthwith:—
“The learned Counsel in question stated that he had hoped it would not be supposed
that he was capable of º want of respect either to HER MAJESTY or to the Court, and
that he wºuld without, delay attire himself in the full-bottomed wig; he had, however,
understood that the full-bottomed wig should not be worn at Nisi Prius.”
Pretty, as you, MR. PEPYs, might have noted, to see the importance of a
wig,50 solemnly asserted and acknowledged, and the “wisdom in the wig.” a
º true saying. And, Lord, to think how * and robes do help on business,

THE SPHINX AND THE STATUES.
“It is much easier to keep a Conservative majority together
in the House of Commons than a Liberal majority, and that for
reasons which lie at the very root of the case. . ... : If you
examine the remains of Egyptian antiquity, you will find that
the great principle *ś Egyptian artist had in his mind
was the representation of Repose. But if you examine the Greek
school of Art, which is admitted on all hands to be the head of all
schools, you will find that the predominating principle of the
Greek representations is life .# motion. . . . . You will find,
I think, that the predominating idea of Conservatism is the
Egyptian principle of repose; but in our Liberal party we have
got the Greek idea of life and motion. I need not tell you that
when you have got a lot of statues arranged, it is not very diffi-
cult to keep them in order; but if all those Conservative statues
were to become suddenly animated with the power and the wish
to walk about the halls in which they were placed, no doubt the
uestion of drill would become much more serious and more
ifficult.”—MR. GLADston E at Birmingham.
The Sphinx soliloquiseth—
EgyptAN versus Greek! Sublime Repose,
Cold Silence puzzling friends and baffling foes,
Against unresting stir and hot pugnacity,
Backed by a more than feminine loquacity:
Agreed, my GLADSTONE! Gladly I accept
The apt comparison. You’re an adept -
In lore Hellenic : for myself, men say r
Semitic nous is more in my calm way.
They say! What say they not ? The mob must have
Its Mephistopheles. Once Louis gave -
The quidnuncs quarry; BISMARCK now, and I-
Arcades ambo-lead them in full cry
Though mostly on false scents. All fools believe
The man whose heart is not upon his sleeve,
A mine of mystery sinister and dark,
Whose secrets they, and they alone, may mark.
My craft is Asiatic P Beit so! .
The East's our cruz, and Eastern guile may go
Some way to solving it, when Western wit
As blatant as Boeotian, fails to hit. -
Greek statues, GLADSTONE * Then some frolic elf,
Some mad †. we say yourself?–
Has quickened them to wild spasmodic life,
And set them all at hot and aimless strife.
Ajax defies Achilles; Nestor snubs
Astute Ulysses, who severely drubs
Fast-tongued Thersites. No, 'tis not “Repose.”
When Greek meets Greek, black eyes and broken nose
Afford a sight that fills with boundless joy
The calm ‘. in the Tory Troy
Who have but little cause to dread a blow
From statues who can't keep in statu quo.
The placid Sphinx looks on, and blandly smiles,
His stone-still squadrons proof against the wiles
Of tempters who would break their serried ranks,
And set them, like your own, at crack-brained pranks,
Till, as with smashed antiques in learned shows,
Nor arm mates leg, nor mouth will pair with nose.
Hotfriend, so prompt to pose for every part
From Nestor to Achilles, all true Art
Aims at Repose. Ask RUSKIN. There's your lack;
When you are up with harness on your back,
And blade in fist, against whatever odds,
Your swashing bioºs a tacle for gods.
I’ve felt it, and speak feelingly. But rest
Is a soft blessing stranger to your bre
Nor can you shape its semblance, or º
The surface-calm which covers inward fray,
Like—well, like any Artist., Foes may tremble
At your hot wrath, yet he who can't dissemble
Is but half armed against the shocks of fate,
Nor can he rightly war who cannot wait.
My statues may seem stolid, but they stand;
#.e Y. at every stir but stumble. Grand
Is Greek mobility, no doubt, but still , .
Would you not like a lightly sterner drill,
A little steadier discipline P You flush |
For shrewd finesse you do not care a rush-.
No Greek in that, you trust to “life and motion,”
Untiring zeal an Fº devotion.
Extremely fine! But then your Statues stray.
Good Sir, you cannot guide your Greeks that way,

Whose end is broken host and banished chief.

PROPOSED NEW PRISON RULES.
(See Debate in the House of Commons, Thursday, June 7.)
No prisoner is in future to be exposed to the indignity of being
conducted to his place of detention in the official van. If he pos-
sesses a conyeyance of his own, he will be allowed to ride in it
accompanied by a policeman (not in uniform); otherwise, a cab wi
be . lied for his journey, (the constable in plain clothes sittin
outsi 3. and the expense defrayed jointly out of the Rates an
the Consolidated Fund.
Each prisoner on his arrival will be received by the Governor, and
accommodated with a seat in the Governor's parlour until the apart-
ment designed for his use is ready for his reception: In the case of
females, the Governor's wife will also be in attendance. Refresh-
ments will be provided.
... A prisoner can refuse to occupy the apartment provided for him,
if he has reason to suspect that the sheets of his bed have not been
properly aired:
Prisoners will be allowed to wear their hair in whatever way they
please, and, except at their own request, the official hair-dresser
will not interfere with their coiffure.
After the 1st of January, 1878, all prison dresses (except those
Worn ‘. the officials) will be abolished.
. All degrading Fº will be discontinued, and only such
inflicted as appeal to the best feelings of our common nature, and
cause no compromise of a prisoner's moral dignity. For instance,
the Governor is empowered to deprive a prisoner of his daily paper,
to stop (or certainly to dilute) his wine, beer, and spirits rations, to
cut him off from the companionship of any cat, dog, caged bird, or
other domesticated animal, that may be cheering his solitary
moments, and to prohibit the use, for any period not exceeding
twelve hours, of his flute, accordion, concertina, &c.
Bowls, skittles, ninepins, Aunt Sallies, &c., will be provided in
the Recreation Grounds for those prisoners whose conduct has been
meritorious. -
Prisoners can subscribe to a Circulating Library, on application to
the Chaplain.
Female prisoners will be allowed the use of a piano, by permission
of the Wisiting Justices.
It will be the duty of the Visiting Justices to satisfy themselves,
at their weekly inspection, that each apartment is as snug and cosy
as the few simple and lenient rules which in future will be en-
forced, will permit. They must see that the Kamptulicon on the
floor is in fº condition, that the pattern of the Yºlº is
cheerful and in nice taste, that the springs of the easy-chair are
sound, and that the feather-bed is perfectly comfortable.
Prisoners may see their friends once a week, but no visitor will be
allowed to remain more than two hours at a time, and no prisoner
can receive more than three visits on the same day. The interviews
will take place in the prisoner's own #. apartment, and every
precaution will be taken to guard himself and his friends from
intrusion. -
No restrictions will be placed upon prisoners' private corre-
spondence: Stationery will be supplied, but not postage stamps.
When the thermometer reaches freezing }. female prisoners
will be supplied with hot-water bottles at bed time. -
A prisoner will have full liberty to send for his own family medical
attendant, if he is not satisfied with the gaol surgeon; and if he has
been accustomed to homoeopathic treatment, he can demand to be
visited by a practitioner of that school of medicine.
The prison diet will be such as is usually seen on the tables of the
middle classes.
Smoking allowed after four o'clock.

“No, indeed. Infinitesimal doses of gin would, however, cure

“Good,” said the BISHoP, who had overheard the chat between
his Chaplain and D.R. CLARA. “And so now for our little penny

THE MORAL OF THE “OAKS.”
(As read by four-legged Fillies to two-legged.)
Look, fussy, fretfulfillies—you that fume
And fight for Man's rights by the name of Woman's;
And lash the Press and #. to a spume,
In your fierce press to scale the House of Commons!
And you, fast fillies in a different way,
Who on the social mill make toil of pleasure,
Life-sentenced to †. nothing, night and day,
In the unending labour you call leisure!
And you, hysteric shriekers †. pain, -
Beit your own or other's, alike nothing, -
Whether of crumpled rose-leaves you complain,
Or social, legal, grievance sets you frothing;
Whether you go for pleasures, rights, or wrongs,
Myfussy fillies, º slaving, sighing,
Take to your hearts, shrined in this song of songs,
The precious moral of last Oaks, won flying.
'Twas not Astraea, daughter of the stars,
Quickstep, Mirobolante, nor Miss Golightly—
Names smºking of the “fastness” that scorns bars—
Nor yet Plaisante, though christened all so brightly,
Nor bright Belphaebe, with her port of pride,
Nor Merrythought, that cheers e'en toil of pleasure—
'Twas none of these that to the front did glide,
And to her owner proved herself a treasure.
But Placida, still calm of port and pace,
For . or wrongs unfretful and unfussy,
That took her pleasure wisely, like her race,
Serene, and at her ease, e'en when most busy,
'Twas she, whose name speaks gentleness and calm,
That won the Oaks—from first to last untackled—
That took and kept the lead, “d la {{... dame,”
With sweep of strength that speaks in grace unshackled.
Placida, type of all her sex should be,
Rather than are: the fillies' fair ideal!
In her let all her biped sisters see
No fancy picture—Placida is real.
'Tis calm and gentleness, control of pace,
Of wind and limb, ambition, passion, pity,
That make the winner of the fillies race,
Biped or quadruped—so ends my ditty!

“GERMS" OF INFECTION.
DR. H.CHARITON BASTIAN, in a letter on the controversy
between himself and PROFEssoR TYNDALI, about “Spon-
taneous Generation,” quotes from one of the learned Pro-
fessor's recent lectures on that subject, the statement that
the air of the Royal Institution has been for some time
“filled with a virulently infecting atmosphere.” There
searcely needs a chemical philosopher, with his tests and
instruments of nice analysis–detective of nasty impurities
—to tell us that. It is too well known to frequenters of
the Temple of Science in Albemarle Street, especially from
experience in the Lecture Theatre on Friday evening
meetings. So long ago as in FARADAY's time, even when
FARADAY was lecturing, its air, impure from ill ventila-
tion, gould send listeners to sleep...So now they may
sometimes nod, although listening to TYNDALL. The only
wonder is that the atmosphere of the Royal Institution,
replete with putrifiable germs, does not infect, every-
body who ventures to breathe it with putrid fever
from the Professor's various hay, infusions. The ques-
tion, “Do you boil your hay?” in suburban circles,
where hay-fever is a favourite º: about this time,
will soon become as pertinent and as prominent as MRs.
WEDLAKE's “Do you bruise your oats?” used to be in

JAMEs GoLDSTICK, G.C.B., O.L.A., and GENERAL LORD MUDDLE,

P.M., at the Horse Guards (old style), in Bath chairs, provided by a
Paternal Government with india-rubber cushions, rugs, and hot-
- SIR. C. NILE showed considerable agility in throwing
his hot-water apparatus at the sentry, who gave the wrong salute,
and an admiring public, consisting of two messengers and a commis-
sionnaire, and our office-boy, had plenty of opportunity to compare
the youth and freshness of the gallant General's audible expletives,
and the age of a yenerable joke which he dropped on the steps as he
was assisted up by an amiable Aide-de-Camp. He was supplied
with a light luncheon of lamb and ground-rice pudding, washed
down by a bottle of port.
SIR St. JAMES Goldstick had to be carried in by the united efforts
of three Aides-de-Camp, as the dear old General persisted in a desire
to draw cocked hats on the payement, with a stick of cosmetique,
used to give a purple shade to his moustaches,

with apparent relish by the trio of gallant veterans, the impressive
ceremony of investiture with the Field-Marshal's bâton was pro-
ceeded with. The venerable recipients of this symbol of military
command showed some inclination to babble of green fields, hand-
grenades, and wooden walls, and got quite hot at one moment over
a discussion of the relative values of hair-powder and pipeclay;
but as they had been accommodated with high chairs, with bars in
front, to rest their arms, on; the altercation, accompanied as it
was at moments by considerable liveliness of gesticulation, never
became really dangerous to the gallant, old, boys. Before they were
wheeled off, SIRC, NILE was understood to have expressed himself as
much disgusted that his bâton was not made of sucre d'orge, while
GENERAL SIR St. JAMEs GoLDSTICK wept when he heard that the
DUKE of WELLINGTON was dead, and LoBD MUDDLE expressed his
anxiety to get back to dinner with NELson and, LoBD BYRON. But
the ceremony was, on the whole, got through with striking success;
and nobody can doubt that the mantle of the Iron Duke, which under
our military system, falls, sooner or later, on the right shoulders,
has so fallen, though rather later than sooner, in this case.

Such, and so proportioned, peroration to demand, is LoRD, DE

empty title, we have not had suggested so formidable a barrier
against the Russian Bogey as LoRD DE MAULEY's Consul. It is true
the suggestion savours of political homoeopathy—“similia simili-
bus”—a phantom sentinel against a nightmare foe! LoRD DE
Mauley, too ! The name smacks of the noble art of self-defence—
as if a man should say “Lord Fisticuff.” . But if the Russian
“rally” were really to be feared, what should we have to say of
such a “counter”?
LORD SALISBURY was at pains to explain that a thousand miles of
waterless desert and inaccessible mountain between English and
Russianfrontiers, and between the Russ and his base of supplies, were
a more trustworthy barrier than LoRD, DE MAULEY’s “buffer,” and had
that the look-out man for British territorial interests in that quarter
is not a Consul for Central Asia but the Viceroy of British India.
He put the same idea into more epigrammatic form at the Merchant
Taylors' banquetthe same night—thankstotheir continence of speech,
my Lords can do their, debating and dining without clash-in a
phrase in which Punch has found the germ of a Cartoon. “It has
enerally been acknowledged to be madness to go to war for an ide
ut it is yet more ºg. go to war against a nightmare.”
Awful language for an Indian Secre to use of India's peril from
the Muscovite, and, more a *:::: , LoRD DERBY endorsed it,
and even called it “admirable!”. No wonder the Russophobe or

fussy.friends, D. T. and P. M. G., and M. P.-meaning, of course,
Del. Trem., Past Grand Master, and Member of Parliament.
LoRP TRURo, recording his Blackheath experiences, dwelt on the
coincidence—which he seemed to think curious, but which to
Punch seems but natural—that though he had been in the habit of
passing over the Heath at all hours of the day and night for ten
years, he had never seen, a bad character or a policeman. At the
same time, his house in the neighbourhood had been robbed four or
five times 1 Evidently, that was what the bad characters were
about while my Lord was out walking over the Heath—
“I went to TRURo's house,
TRURO wasn't at home,
TRURo he was on the Heath,
So I his goods did bone !”
LoRD TRURO wants, to know, if the district, is to be protected
against the recent “revivals” of Captain Macheath and Jerry
Abershaw P - -
LoRD BEAUCHAMP gave the requisite assurances; and the Con-
servative BARON REDEsdale gave a hint to LoRD TRURO that if he
carried a revolver, he wouldn't have much to fear from the
Blackheath branch of the Clan Macheath. The RDs still smack
of their Border stock, and evidently hold to the orthodox, old Redes-
dale rule, “Let ilka man's haun' keep ilka man's heid.”
(Commons.)—SIR. G. Bowy ER asked the ATTORNEY-GENERAL
whether, the Federation of Liberal Associations, lately hatched at
Birmingham, did or did not come within the danger of the Statute

ugly growths of that fermenting time, so abundant in United
Societies for the dissolution of everything P ... . -
MR. CHAMBERLAIN asked the same question, in relation to the
“Federation of Conservative Associations.”
The ATToRNEY-GENERAL, was happily, able to reassure Bowy ER
against CHAMBERLAIN, and CHAMBERLAiN against Bowyer. Neither
Liberal nor Conservative Federation is so clearly within both spirit
and letter of the Act of 1799 that the ATTORNEY-GENERAL can see
his way to recommend indictment. But SIR GEORGE had better try
it, if he see his way, Ditto CHAMBERLAIN. . . -

the Fenian prisoners, and elicited, the old answer. There are onl
six of them: two for murder, three soldiers, and one, sentenc
after, special consideration of his case, to fifteen years, a term
which may be shortened.
Of course PARNELL and BIGGAR were in the thick of it. The Major
-more power to him—pointed out that the great mistake made by
these men was, that they did not succeed. He quoted the case of
the drawer of a crossed cheque write “Not negotiable” across it, the
banker who pays it does so at his peril. MR. HUBBARD wants to
extend this to all crossed cheques. It is purely a question of mer-
cantile convenience, and the House declined to disturb last year's
Act by 175 to 66. - -

the House kept on altering it, what would become of the unhappy

Count ANDRAssy, who once bore arms against the Emperor of Austria: | boo
“The man had been a political offender, but what was he to-day?—
Prime Minister of Austria.”
The Major should have quoted the case of GAVAN DUFFY: “The
man had been a political offender against the British Govern-
ment, but what had he become since?—Prime Minister of a great
British Colony.”
A fight in Supply over Queen's Plates—in which the Major came
out in good “form,”—an cret Service Money, a great chance
for PARNELL and RYLANDS, who boasted, not without reason, that
he had unearthed one indefensible appropriation of the fund to
augmentation ºf the salary of the man who managed it. But what
service could be more secret than spending secret-service money?
After all, if you can't trust, your Government to do its dirty work
as cheaply as possible, what ean you trust it to do?

That is the distinctive beauty of the Upper House.

Montagu at the Holy Land before he'll tell him anything about

Such is the style in which Foreign Office insolence dares insult the
laudable desire for information in private Members!
BIGGAR and PARNELL had such a morning of it on the Prisons
Bill. They moved a great deal, but didn't carry anything. If
these noble. Arcadians had the ordering of prisons, what pleasant
places of sojourn º would be—i.e., for prisoners! But wouldn’t

MR. PEASE, for abolition — of the Punishment of Death. An

Punch cannot but believe that there is a class of rufians who are
only checked by fear of the gallows from ca ying their brutality
to those in their 1. beyond cruelty to deadly violence; that the
gallows Qught to be maintained º, for these wretches, and that
to abolish the terror of it would be to expose to new dangers a most

the subject is agreed that our law, which now lumps under the

even when the law and the #: fail to draw the distinction
(as seems to have been the case in the instance of Dohenry, quoted
by John BRIGHT), so long Punch cannot º: that the gallows is

LoRD REDESDALE called their Lordships' attention to these offen-
sive, insidious, and indecent little shoves to sacerdotalism, before a
House in which the Bench of Bishops was repr by five
prelates, of whom the ARCHBISHOP of CANTERBURY the Bishop
of GloucestER AND BRIsroL joined in denunciation of these prurient
and pernicipus aids to impurity, and the Society of the Cross under
whose auspices they are issued. Punch would like to catch one of
the priestly handlers of these poisonous manuals on his premises!
MR. Tooth, it seems, is Seefe to the º Mission of this

MR, WAppy and MR, GoschEN drew down rebuke from both Irish

felony.” Ofie can understand such an outburst on the part of those
who may be supposed to look on the preaching of treason-felony as
the business of a National pulpit. But that English Liberals should
protest against treating treason-felons as criminals of a very mis-
chievous kind, is less easy to explain.
When MR, Cowen invokes the right of insurrection he seems to
forget that this is one of the rights which must have a wrong at the
bottom of them. The right which is sacred when exerted against
brute-force and oppression, becomes a * instead of a right

day in this country are unjustifiable disturbers of the peace; rebels
not against oppression, but against order, progress, and law-regu-
lated removal of abuses.

Friday {{...}.} course the Foreign Office was glad to publish
Coloneſ. MANsfielp's dispatches, showing how Russia converts
Greek Uniates by whipping and cell imprisonment, altogether very
much as MARY converted Protestants to the true Church. Foreign
Office takes a particular, pleasure just now in slapping Russia in
the face, and Society enjoys the slap. LoRD Houghton isn't sur-
rised. It is only pretty Russia's way, That is why the Catholic
hurch, like the Jews, wishes God speed to the Turks. LoRD STANLEY
of ALDERLEY wants iono Granviºs answers to Colonel Mans-
FIELD's dispatches. But this is too much for LoRD DERBY. We
may lecture Turks, though we musn't coerce them...But, we must
not interfere with Russia's internal administration, though we may
slap her in the face, and tell her she's a big, blustering, equivo-
cating bully, whom we decline to believe on her oath.
It is not true (see the MARQUIs of SALISBURY's answer to the DUKE
pf ARGYLL) that we have quarrelled, or mean to quarrel-if we can
help it—with the Ameer of Afghanistan, or that we are making
reparations, which savour of war on our North-western fron-
ier. All such reports are, in fact, “shaves”—the growth of Indian
gossip in private letters. Indian officials will gossip, but Govern-
ment is trying to break them of the habit. . - -

A BOOR AT A CITY BOARD.
ITY Boards have a º: right to

- good things, not against them, But
when the City Corporation and the City
ilds are free to feast in
spite of Precisians and Par-
liament, shall City Guar-
dians be belly-bound by
strict auditors and grum-
bling ratepayers—nay, even
by scurvy so-called Re-
formers of their own hardly-
used and imperfectly-nou-
rished body? We have
before us a letter headed,
“City of London Accounts,”
from a City Guardian for
St. Botolph, rightly named
Book, in which he sets forth
alleged irregularities in the
accounts of the City Guar-
dians, principally under the
head of “Refreshments” or
“Entertainments.” Is it to
be wondered at that Book,
being evidently the sort of
man to rob a poor City
Guardian of his lunch, should have been treated as he complains in
his letter?—
“I have been excluded from all Committees, the resolutions against me
being proposed or framed by and at the instigation of one particular member
of one of the House Committees, MR. John Cox. Why, let me ask? I have
not partaken of any of the soup, fish, flesh, fowl, jams, jellies, custards, desserts,
&c., &c., furnished the Committee at the ratepayers' expense. I have not
been a party to the splitting up of large bills into smalſ ones, so as to pay
them out o º cash, and thus blind the Government Auditor.” I was not
aware of such a practice existing, until the matter came out in evidence before
a Special Committee on which I was placed. I thereupon tried all I could to
put a stop to such a state of things, by attending at the proper Committees,
with the necessary suggestions for putting an end to the manipulations. I
was defied, and the officers told not to answer my questions.”
“Questions,” indeed! Pretty uestions! Objections to refresh-
ment accounts and pastry-cooks' charges for entertainments to which
Book was never asked 1 -

What should we infer from such a Coalition but that the public
had uttered “A *ś on both your Houses!” in accents so decisive
that Ins and Quts, Whigs and Tories, Conservatives and Liberals,
had been startled to the conclusion that those who said so meant it,
and that “measures not men” must, for once, be the order of the
day?
§. it, is said that this portentous Coalition, Ministry in Greece
means business for once—i.e., that Greece feels that a crisis is at

his dependents. will have to be put to hazard, So Hellas has

reasons urged by the Cardinal on Pope CLEMENT THE SEVENTH for
“throwing down a few superfluous Monasteries in England”:—
“That his Holiness could not be ignorant what divers effects this new
invention of printing had produc’d. For as it had brought in and restor'd
books and learning, so together it hath been the occasion of those sects and
schisms which daily, appear'd in the world, but chiefly in Germany, where
men began now to call in *..." the present faith and tenets of the Čhurch,
and to examine how far religion is departed from its primitive institution.
And that, which particularly was to be lamented, they #. exhorted lay and
ordinary men to read the Scriptures, and to pray in their vulgar tongue.
That, if this were suffer'd, besides all other dangers, the common people at
last might come to believe that there was not so much use of the clergy. For
if men were persuaded once . could make their own way to God, and that
º in their native and ordinary language might pierce Heaven, as well
as Latin, how much would the authority of the mass fall How prejudicial
might this prove unto all our ecclesiastical orders.”

seventeen I Fº the First Officer
in the Lady of Lyons, and at
eighteen doubled Romeo and the
Nurse in Romeo and Juliet. -
Q. What are your favourite
parts?
A. Dazzle in London Assurance,
Sir Peter Teazle in The School for
Scandal, Bob Acres in She Stoops
to Conquer, Mr. Golightly in Lend Me Five Shillings, and
Macbeth.
Q. What is your idea of acting P -
4. To learniny words, and to go to a theatre where the piece for
which I am cast is being played constantly, with a view to copying
every movement of the actor whose part I am afterwards to sustain.
Q. Do you not think that it would be better to think out your
parts º: yourself, instead of giving a weak imitation of an old
origina
A. Certainly not. My First Officer in the Lady of Lyons was
never a ſº success until I had seen it played by some one else.
Q. What are your objects in acting P -
A. First, to show myself in various costumes to my friends and
relatives, and, secondly, to benefit some obscure charity.
ti Poe. the obscure charity benefit very largely by your exer-
10ns
A. Not very frequently. After all expenses have been paid, a
five-pound note is rather a handsome average for the surplus,
Q. Are you aware that amateur performances in the country
ſº do great injury to professional actors?
. So I have been told. -
Q. Are you aware that many a provincial manager and his com-
pany have been reduced to penury by these entertainments?
A. I believe so.
Q. Would you be surprised if a manager were to offer you more
than thirty shillings a week to become a member of his company?
4. I should be very much surprised indeed.
Q. Would you (and I appeal to you as a sensible man) play the
part of audience at an amateur performance in which you had no
personal interest—I mean no part to play ?
A. Under no consideration whatever.

Unchanging, and unending. WYCLIFFE's tongue
And GAxton's type; the fiery zeal that flung
Truth's gage against all odds, the sober wit
That gave the goddess wings, and bade her flit
From cloister down to cottage, with the light

right.
The selfsame light—whose permeating glow
From Lutterworth five hundred years ago
Startled Pope, Prince, and Prelate with its gleam,
And just a century later with a beam
broad diffusiveness was winged to fly
Abroad from Westminster's old Almonry,
Still leads our Vanguard legions, while, with fear
And wilful blindness smitten, in the rear
The lovers of the Darkness crouch, and curse
Those dauntless facers of the dawn. Perverse
And purblind Priestdom, ever slow to learn
Why so persistently Light's blessing spurn }

His fiery fulminations nought availed
Against the beaçon-fire that WycLIFFE raised—
From which a kindling brand soon brightly blazed
On every hearth in England. But what hope,
Born of the shadows, buoys our later Pope,
The kindly age-worn man, whose Jubilee
E’en stubborn foes could wish that they were free
To celebrate in kindness? Yet o'er º
WYCLIFFE illumed this Pope would spread the pall

That freedom well might nurse nor suffer scaith,

To sacred books of winning access free,
These WYCLIFFE stood for, these stout CAxton's press
Helped onward to a slow but sure success;
These Pius and his guardseen now would stay,
Invoking night at the full noon of day,
As did their predecessors at its dawn,
And cursing Wisdom's seed as Evil's spawn.
The Jester, sobered at the saddening sight,
Sighs while he smiles, yet, loyal to the light,
Checking awhile the jingle of his mirth
Before the sad-faced sage of Lutterworth—
An earlier LUTHER, born of British blood,
As keen as calmly wise, as brave as good—
Puts by his bâton that stout soul to greet,
And lays the laurel at JoHN WYCLIFFE's feet.
Something Like Military Intelligence.
“The troopship Assistance, with the 104th Regiment on board, has arrived
at Kingstown, from Jersey, and proceeded to the Curragh Camp for the drill
season.”

Times. Talk of “Horse Marines” contemptuously after this Of

Submarine Fish-Frightening.
It seems that the West Country fishermen are inflicting grievous
amage, and some, alarm, on the shoals of sea-fish, by exploding
charges of dynamite on the ground where they have hitherto been
content to trawl for bass and brill, plaice and soles.
This is clearly an extension of the use of the fish-torpedo which

THE World of Fashion has been convulsed with a thrill
of horror by an unprecedented outrage on Society, as
represented by the dignified attendance of Aristocracy at
the sports of Ascot. According to a dreadful police
report, on Tuesday last—
“At Hammersmith, MAJoR ERLAN applied to MR. BRIDGE
for a summons for an assault. He stated that on Wednesday he
was near Gunnersbury Station, with his two daughters, looking
at the vehicles returning from Ascot Races, when a four-horse
coach, driven by LoRD LoNDEsBoRough, passed, and he was
struck on the breast by a bag of sawdust thrown from it” (!)
True, indeed, is it that—
“Replying to the Magistrate, the Major said he did not know
who threw the bag of sawdust.”
And of course, he was under a mistaken impression in
the idea that it was thrown by anybody on LoBD
LoNDESBoRough's drag. Nobody of LoRD LoNDES-
BoBough's party could possibly have thrown bags of
sawdust on the return from Ascot at Ladies and Gentle-
men, or, indeed, at anybody, or even haye had such a
thing as a bag of sawdust to throw. But the horrid
fact is that a bag of sawdust was thrown by somebody or
other from some passing vehicle on the road. Appalling
event! What if this be the º: of the end of the
dignity and glory of Ascot; the first, symptom of the
decline of Ascot Races to the level of Epsom and
Hampton? What next? Are we doomed hereafter to
witness men and youths ºff from the “Cup” with
§ lementary noses on, and dolls in their hat-bands?
it be our sad fate to hear them blowing trumpets
and tooting horns, and playing the Two Obadiahs, or
the street-tune then popular, whatever it may be, on an
accordion? Is the gathering on the Heath itself to be
yulgarised by irrepellable Progress, and has its decadence
been initiated by the bag of sawdust thrown at Mºon
ERLAN ?
Of course MR. BRIDGE could not grant a summons for
the appearance of a caitiff own. MAJOR ERLAN
said he would write to LoRD LoNDEsBoRough for that
miscreant's name and address, but of course the noble
Lord knows nothing of so impossible a companion.
Though driving with his back to any cad who might have
intruded, he would have iº, felt the presence of
an offender, whose moral emanations, as sensible as the
effluvia of the dead fly in the #. unguent,
would have got him at once detected and expelled.
Too Good NEws To BE TRUE (from a Sandwich

WHUSKEY
RITUALISTS IN REBELLION.
THE Council of the Church Union, which boasts to have enrolled
under its Ritualistic banner 2,586 clergy and 16,496 communicants
has at last thrown down the gauntlet to the Law. With a coo
petitio principii it declares that the Ridsdale judgment has “ren-
dered penal much of the ceremonial which the Church of England
retained at the Reformation, and reconsidered and resettled in 1662.”
Now, the very question for decision, in the Ridsdale, case was
whether the practices the Reverend defendant had followed at
Folkestone were such as the Church of England at the Reformation
and, Post-revolutionary Resettlement had, reconsidered and re-
settled * The Judges of the Privy Council have decided that they
were not. The Council of the Church Union, flying in the face of
the Judges, call on Convocation to do likewise, and advise the
clerical members of the Ünion to treat the Ridsdale judgment as
the idle, utterance of “a body recently appointed, and -
real authority.”
At the same time that this document is adopted by the Church
Union, the Church Association meets to express its satisfaction with
the Ridsdale Judgment; its determination to do all in its power
to see that the judgment is enforced; and its delight at the blow
dealt thereby to the trade of the Church milliner, and the celebra-
#:* sacrifice of the Mass by the Clergy of the Church of
gland.

It would be avery§ quarrel as it stands, were it not that both
Church Union and Church Association are in the main Clerical
bodies, and their bone of contention nothing less than the founda-
tions of the Established Church, and the claims of her Clergy.

“Hawks,” says the proverb, “will not pike out hawks' een,” but
Clerical crows, it would seem, decline to follow their wise example,
and are ready, under various names expressive of peace and concºrd,
to fight to the death against each other, and one of them against
the Law into the bargain.
Let JoHN BULL look to it. He ..º. be anxious to see a clean
sweep made of his Church by Law Established; but when a large
§ within his Church by Law Established defies, disowns, and
disobeys the Law, it has already disestablished itself...
There is only one duty for the Clergy who take this course; to
shake off the yoke under which they refuse to bow their necks, and to
cease to eat the bread of an Establishment whose laws they defy.
“That's so,” my Reverend Gents of the Church Union, and no
two ways about it.
“Paris vaut bien une messe,” said HENRI QUATRE. “La messe
vaut bien le presbytëre,” should be the saying—followed up by
doing—of the Church Union.
You will be easier, where your opinions are already-out of our
pale. A Protestant Establishment will be infinitely more comfort-
able out of yours.
More Pernicious Literature.
A sacERDOTAL manual of auricular confession, privately printed,
and circulating among an association of Anglican Clergymen styling
themselves the “Society of the Holy Cross,” which LoRD REDESDALE
the other evening denounced to the House of Lords, is not so happily
named as perhaps it might be. Such is the character of this work,
that, if sold openly, it would perhaps be subject to seizure under
LoRo CAMPREEL's Act. It is entitled The Priest in Absolution...An
obvious analogy to another treatise, at present under prosecution,
suggests as a better title for it—Fruits of Theology.

DIARY OF MY RIDE TO KHIVA.
(Diary continued, and forwarded by Private Wire.)"

Mid-day, Saturday-Came up with a private Garayan, consisting of an aged
Moldayian, an old Wallachian, a Merryvingian (such a funny fellow!), a couple of
Kirghiz-men, and one Roumaniac from Kolni Hatchski. The old Wallachian, a bald
man without any moustache or beard, was very unwell. He said he'd make his will,
and leave me º: I would only gure him. Felt his pulse. Having no
medicine by me, gave him some of MR. BRILLANTINE’s Essential Regeneratative
Stimuloso—(a powerful oil for strengthening and darkening the hair. N. B.-Here
would be a fine opportunity for taking advantage of my riding to Khiva as a Travelling
* It may have been observed that we have allowed the last two letters to appear without
(comparatively) note or comment. The fact is we have been compelled to observe the utmost
caution, as well in the public's interest as in our own. But for our certainty that our Khivan
Correspondent is not within reading distance, we should not append this Note. Fortunately, we
are in possession of his entire MS., which we shall either withhold or publish as may suit our
convenience and serve the cause of Truth and Justice. We are not prepared, as in view of legal

e may be. We have taken Counsel's opinion, and Counsel says that “in a criminal case, where
the charge must be verbally accurate, and the evidence of guilt be in strict accordance with the
wording of the charge, it would be very difficult to prove that, at some time or other, during the
course of these letters, our Correspondent was not riding in the direction of Khiva, as he has
alleged. For example, it must first,” says Counsel's opinion, “be proved (vide 1 Wiii.e. 2) that
he was not riding—and all along the onus probandi is with the prosecution; secondly, it must be
prºved that, if riding, he was not riding to Khiva. Now, it is evident,” says Counsel's opinion,
‘that any person on mounting his horse in Park Lane, for example, is competent (vide Crosse &
Blackwell's Digest, 2.0.T.) to remark, to those about him, “I am now going to ride to Khiva,
and may, to give a local colour to the assertion, actually turn his horse's head in an Eastern
or a Southern or a South-eastern or South-western direction, according to his (the rider's) ideas
of where Khiva may be situated. For his bond fide intention having been announced of ridin
to Khiva, the law presumes that a sane person knows what he is about, and is acquainted wit
the road he has undertaken to travel; on which road only by mistake, to which all human beings
are liable, or by misadventure, to which all human beings are subject (wide decision in Fowl and
Pullitt's case, under 10 Hen. 8, Egg, Shelley, and Boyle's #. he could be possibly supposed
to go X." Therefore,” continues Counsel's opinion, “though the Correspondent in question
may never have left London, yet if he were bond fide and of honest though mistaken purpose, per-
tually riding to Khiva, there would be, and could be, no basis for a criminal prosecution, nor,
indeed, any safe ground for an action at common law.” (Wide 4 Geo. 2, c. Gunn's Reports,
edited by J. INgo.)
Thus advised, it is necessary for us to be cautious and reserved. We may mention, however,
that we have secured #:W. and have, at a considerable outlay in the shape of an annuity
to his mother, got a firm hold on Our Own Confidential Boy. ... We are now going to take Counsel's

TWO JUDGES.
3\miral $0.15,
stew Artid of The Jockey CLUB.
Born, January, 1795. Died, June 19, 1877.
Two Judges have to higher judgments passed,
Leaying their record, each in his own Court;
As if Fate's *} for once had classed
The Bench of Justice with the Seat of Sport.
We hear the “Bravo, Rous!” in death, as life,
From Jockey Club and handicappers' bar,
Where—strange repose from elemental strife—
He steered his Turf craft, like a ship of war,
With pluck, and purpose clear, and voice of power,
Through shoals of knavery and sands of sin;
Truth his chain-cable, honour his best bower,
Good name to risk and little love to win!
Light lie the turf on the Turf-Judge's grave!
ay his work's merits o'er its kind prevail;
Norlet the sorry sport for which he gave
His life's best part against him weight the scale.
Not such our prayer above that other bier
Whereon a nobler Judge to rest is laid;
Whose work was worthy of the soul sincere
That triumphed o'er disease, and pain o'er-swayed.
W!: $ight jom. Sir 6torſt titlist,
LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL.
Born, 1814. Died, June 15, 1877.
From his youth up a martyr on the rack
Of unearned suffering that most wills had tamed,
And turned a nature less heroic back
From strenuous effort, pitied and unblamed.
But, quenching sense in spirit, he so strove,
That early manhood found him early wise,
A Sage in whom, as pain o'ercame not love,
Strong soul weak body bore on high emprize.
Till on the judgment-seat, as on the way
That led up to its honours, he was seen,
Bearing the heat and burden of his day,
Of soul unruffled, patient, and serene;
With a sweet sadness putting pain aside,
To bend his ripened judgment to the cause,
And turn the clear light of his mind to guide
His brethren through our labyrinthine laws.
When men, in after times, would have held up
The glass of all that a great Judge should be,
The face of MELLISH, with his bitter cup
Beside him, let the Bar of England see
TWO WOMEN.
Carolint (Élizabeth Šārāl Śortún
(LADY STIRLING-MAXWELL).
Born, 1809. Died, June 15, 1877.
ONE lived for grace—one lived for good; so runs,
In brief, the record of Two Women's claims,
Whose lives, unlike, closed with close-following suns,
Bequeathing memories diverse as their fames.
One, the famed daughter of a famous line,
With grace and charm, with wit and beauty dowered,
Yet on whose power to please, and will to shine,
Some adverse star malignant influence showered.
Her bridal wreath was blent with weeds of strife:
An ill world's ill report, by party aimed,
Fleshed its foul shafts in her unguarded life,
Until fair-weather friendship shrank afraid,
And hate and envy gave their tongues free play
On the proud soul that would not be o'er-borne,
But stroye to show brave face to bleakest day,
And hid her wounds, and gave back scorn for scorn:
And sang her song, and smiled her smile, and staunched
Her tears to strain her children to her breast,
But death's pale blight her hope's bright blossom blanched,
And left her all but lone in dark unrest.
Till time and fair life bore down ill-report
And grief in patience, if not peace, was lost ;
And she lived on, and sang, an held her Court,
And dwelt in memories of the loved and lost,
Still beautiful, still graceful, with her voice
Of low, sweet music, and her gift of song;
Tenacious of the friendships of her choice,—
Fast because wisely made as cherished long.
Truest of all, the friend who, at the last,
Gave her marred life the shelter of his name,
And a short sunshine o'er her evening cast,
Denied her in the morning of her fame.
Noble of soul as beautiful, endowed -
With all that should haye crowned a life with joy,
Well for her she has past beyond the cloud,
Tended by faithful love, to join her boy,
NoT on the heights of England's proud estate,
Where its spoilt children keep their giddy round,
§lary Carythitt.
Born, April 3, 1807, Died, June 14, 1877,
The other learned to weigh man and man's fate,
Studied life's lessons and life's labour found.
But in a frugal, pure, and peaceful home,
A place of sober learning learnt to see
Through faith and trust in God's good time to come,
That where ill is, good may, and will, yet be.
Her parents' help, her sisters', brothers' guide,
She grew as high of heart, as mild of mood;
With power o'er youth's rebelliousness and pride,
As one that from her own youth up was good.
And early fixed her mind, and chose her part,
To work in the high faith which few can feel,
That there’s a spring of good in every heart,
So you have love its fountain to unseal.
This faith it was that marked a course for her,
And braced her for its trouble and its toil,
Cheered her 'gainst proofs how much the best may err,
And kept her pure as snow from taint or soil.
Out of the scaffold's shadow and the dark
Of lives from youth-up weaned of §t and air,
She gathered sinking souls into her Ar
Of Love that rode the Deluge of Despair.
'Twas she first drew our city waifs and strays
Within the tending of the Christian fold,
With eyes of love for the averted gaze .
Of a world prompt to scourge and shrill to scold.
From seeds she sowed—in season mattered not,
Or out—for good all seasons are the same—
Sprang new appliances, of love begot, , .
Lost lives to save, and wanderers reclaim.
Nor at home only; when her hair was white
She crossed the sea, on India to bestow .
The love that England prized at length aright,
Following leads she was the first to show.
Not from far ºf: only did she view
The Promised Land, but lived its soil to tread;
And dies bequeathing work for us to do,
While praise and blessing crown her reverend head

silent burial in cases of such “open and notorious evil-livers” that

Christian hope and trust an impious mockery. But the relief which
both Archbishops and two Bishops made §to ask for, the Govern-
ment was afraid to grant, and the House declined, by 146 to 89, to
ease clerical consciences, perhaps distrusting clerical discretion in
grave matters.
But the minority had their revenge when it came to the perform-
ance of the second funeral of the evening—that of the Government
Opposition to LoRD HARRowby's Clause authorising the use in
parish churchyards of burial services other than that of the Church
of England. This was carried against the Government by 127 to
111, the majority of 16 including an Archbishop of Canterbury,
three Bishops (Exeter, Oxford, and, St. Asaph), and twenty-one
Conservative Peers. However the Bill mayfare this year, the Clause
is carried, and its enactment in the law of the future is as good as an
accomplished fact... We congratulate the Church on this abandonment
by its heads, if not its rank and file, of an untenable position.

risk of horses' legs and riders' necks, and MR. GERARD Noel does,
because they are pretty creatures, and it is delightful to see them
turning up their white “scuts” as they flash through the fern);
Short Army Service versus the roster (roaster?) of Indian duty; the
grave question of the gravel between HydePark Corner and the Marble
Arch, (which SIR. H. DRUMMOND Wolff wants, and MR. GERARD
NoFL objects to, because the riding Gentlemen bespatter with it the

if MR. LAYARD had spoken to the SULTAN about his Ministers'
negligence in carrying on the war (MR. Bourke did not know
anything about it. What do we keep a Foreign Office forf);
the Controllership of the Stationery, Department (which has gone

R. CRoss, instead of “nearly a million,” as loosely put by MR. G. Potter);

sive Hobby-ride on the Wednesday he has been lucky enough to get for it; and
though SiR STAFFORD Northcote spoke of the possibility of MR.SMYTH's Bill
being proceeded with, he judiciously said nothing of “probability”).
After its unusually heavy game of “cross questions and crooked answers,”
the House set in for serious business, and the rest of the long night was devoted
to the Navy. Poor MR., WARD HUNT, though scarcely able to stand on his gouty
foot, was regularly baited first by MR. SHAw LEFEVRE, then by DR. Lyon
PLAYFAIR, and then by a whole pack, headed by REED, GoscHEN, and SEELY.
MR. SHAw LEFEvKE fell foul of the Admiralty for abandoning Competitive
Examination for Naval Cadets, and substituting what is called Nomination wit
test examination, but is really the bad old system of patronage revived. It
must be admitted, whatever we may think of Competitive Examination as a
means of getting the best raw material of officers for land or sea, that it is an
improvement on the old Patronage System, which combined hap-hazard and
injustice. MR. SHAw LEFEVRE made out so strong a case that it hardly needed
the strengthening it got from GoRST, CHILDERs, and GoscHEN. As for MR.
HUNT, he had not a leg to stand on—in more senses than one.
But what would be the good of having the priceless blessing of a Conservative
Government, if it did not, as far as possible, restore patronage, and give the
proper sort of people one chance at least for their stupid boys, for whom the
nasty levelling system of competition leaves no *:::::: Poor dear fellows!
Everybody that is anybody ought to be delighted that stupidity should have
its chance. And, after all, the old system gave us very fair officers in NELSON's

“Nous avons, changé tout cela,” you say.,, Machinery calls for, brains as
well as heads and hands. And, however kindly one may feel for the fool of
the family (who had such a good time of it once, that it seems as if he were
having more than his due of hard time now), it does seem rather cool delibe-
rately to turn the Navy into the waste-boy-basket of the Upper Ten Thousand.
DR. LYON PLAYFAIR touched with a gentle hand or
the blunders of the late Arctic Expedition, and .
hinted, while he deprecated, censure. If ever we sen
another, party to the Pole, we must attend more tº
ventilation and varied diet. Probably this had as much
to do with the outbreak of scurvy in the sledging
parties as the omission of lime-juice.
Last came the far more serious question of the
Inflexible. This is the last new type, “the war-ship
of the present,”, and we have other ships a-building or
her lines. She has a central citadel and unarmoured
ends. Will the one float, if the others are riddled ol
shot away?
MR. BARNABY, head of the Board of Naval Construction
-MR. REED's connection and pupil—says “Yes.” MR.
REED, BARNABY's ex-instructor and past-master in
armoured ship-building, says “No ;” declaring that iſ
once her unarmoured ends are º ered, the Inflexible's
armoured citadel will obey inflexible laws of gravitation
by turning the turtle. HUNT might well feel his least
gouty leg shaky under him at the indictment of the
Inflerible, as urged on Monday night, and newspaper
discussion of the subject has not improved matters.
..Punch would not much like to command the Inflexible,
till a considerable Committee has sat upon her. He
resumes that will have to be done before this doubtful
uckling of BRITANNIA's is allowed to be taken into
action. Think, in her first battle, if she were to “take
action” by capsizing !
Tuesday (Lords).-Not a drop of Essence to be extracted
out of the Peers' brief and barren night's work. Tried
by its Peers, Parliament must often be found guilty of
doing next to nothing. But at least it does no harm.
(Commons, Morning Sitting.)—MR. Q. MoRGAN gave
notice, if Government £º. the Burials Bill, he will resur-
rectionise LORD HARRowby's Clause in the shape of a
Resolution.
Prisons Bill read a Third Time, under a leaden pelt of
rotests from such incongruous quarters as RYLANDs,
ETER TAYLOR, NEWIEGATE, Dodson, and PARNELL.
Even men as sensible on most subjects as SIR.W. BARTTE-
Lot, and MR. HIBBERT owned they didn't like it, but depre-
cated division. The opposition to the Bill is based on the
mistaken notion that prison management is a local, not an
imperial, business. Convict prisons are in the hands of
the Central Government already, and there is no reasonin
principle why º Prisons should be in the hands of
local magistrates. There will be plenty of useful workfor
them under the new Bill. Once more, Mr. Punch, in
º with the Bill, takes off his hat to MR. CRoss, as
e did in welcoming it.
The Morning Sitting wound up with a rattling Irish
shindy and tremendous match of Talk against Time, in
which PARNELL and BIGGAR both appeared, in their
favourite characters of the “Hibernian Bore,” and the
“Imperturbable Obstructive.” Talk won easy.
Wednesday—CHAPLIN and Race-horses? Yes. But
CHAPLIN and Road-Locomotives one would have fancied
were like “cows and shwimps” in Lord Dundreary's
zoological classification, “Things that didn't go together.”
A vast variety of opinions was vented on the subject of
these, ugly, but useful, Colossi of Roads, who, having a
giant's strength, are rather tyrannous, now and then, in
using it like giants, to crush 3. roads and lesser things
that travel thereon, to say nothing of frightening horses
h|and causing runaways and, upsets...A Colossus can't be
put in harness with as much impunity as a Pegasus, But
it was evident that the subject was unripe and the Bill ill-
considered, and that the best course was that recom-
mended by MR. ScLATER-Booth—to withdraw it for
longer incubation.
he rest of the sitting was wasted over MR. SHARMAN
CRAwFoRD's Bill for turning Irish Tenants into Land-
lords, by means of an arbitrary extension of Ulster
Tenant Right, which was of course decisively rejected.
Thursday (Lords).-Silent burial of the Burials Bill.
The gay GoRDON may sing–
“That eagle's fate and mine are one,
Who winged the shaft that made him die;
For ‘silent burial' was none,
Save of the Bill 'twas licensed by.”
But over LoRD HARRowBY's Clause, if not over the DUKE
of GoRDON's Bill, Punch may carve “Resurgan.”

counts past, present, and future, does appear, the Collective Wisdom
declines to pay it even the poor compliment of a hearing. The ugly
truth is that Indian finance is voted a matter for experts; and when
even Punch finds it is better to imitate the House, and leave LoRD

whom I had cured with the hair oil / He produced my pockethand-
kerchief, which had been sent to the Washerwoman, and which the
Washerwoman had immediately forwarded to him. He advised me
not to do it again, for it would ; be waste of time, as the Washer-
woman, a stupid person, invariab {:}; everything of the sort to
him, and had to be rewarded for her fidelity by the Government,
out of which he (the Goyernor) did not make anything, except by
way of #. to his stock of linen... He had, he added, quite a
remarkable collection of haberdashery, for all the prisoners wrote on
their pºkeſhandkerchiefs, shirt-fronts, false collars, &c., and so he
had not had a linendraper's bill for years. I undertook not to do
it again, and the Governor promised (out of gratitude for his
cure, and his magnificent growth of hair and whiskers, in conse-
quence of the dose of hair oil) to wink at anything I might do in the
way of escape. To show his friendly spirit, he began by winking at
the cards and the white mouse. "Then he withdrew, but most
thoughtfully returned to wink at the spider, and then, having
winked at everything all round, he left, not however before he had
lost one rouble to me (and paid) over the three-card trick, which was
evidently quite new to him. What a charm there is in novelty!
Night.—Night-Lights brought by the Gaoler and his daughter.
For a consideration they smuggled in some wickski. From my cell I
can see one of the small windows of the Governor's room. It is a mere
slit, just enough for the Governor's eye, which I recognised placed
close to it; and, true to his promise, he is winking at the wickski.
We are safe. Gaoler brought in his own pack of cards (he said he
never trusted prisoners), and insisted on teaching me a Cossack
game, at which he is an adept, called Pºkooh Dmilb. He dealt out
about fifteen packets face downwards, and asked me to choose and
give him one of them. If the card at the bottom of the pack so
chosen should be an ace, then he would pay me on all the other
bottom cards (except aces, for “ties pay dealer”), and if it should be
the Czar (the highest) then I should pay him on all. ...A clever player
at this game can, I believe, so arrange as to “force” the choice of a

opped on to one of the º: and ran off again in a frightened
manner. Gaoler swore he’d have the hole stopped up. It suddenly
occurred to me that I would choose the pack on which the Mouse
had squatted, and give that to the Gaoler. Scarcely had I placed
my finger, hesitatingly, on the pack in question, when, happening
to lookup, I caught the Gaoler's Fº eye (or the eye of the
Gaoler's Daughter—vide first Russian Exercise Book), which, by its
expression, coupled with a movement of her hands aná head, seemed
to say, “Oh, myl what a born idiot you are l l " . . . . Too late to
retract without a row. Gaoler insisted on taking up the pack where
I had placed my finger. I protested. I said I only F. my finger
there by agcident. Gaoler savage. I yielded. ave him the
Czar! Gaoler's Daughter's eye seemed to say, “Well, you are an
ass!”. Yes; but once bitten, twice fly. And then, as I reminded
the Gaoler, we hadn't settled to play for anything. True. In
his eagerness the old humbug had forgotten this, Woºi I make
it a rouble on each pack for the next deal? Certainly—arouble or
a double—that is, a two-rouble piece. ... Deal as before. I hesitated
which to choose. Oddly enough, the Spider came down on a lon
line, hung over a pack, and then ran up again, and disappeared.
looked up: Gaoler's Daughter's eye said “Don't!” and, by a moye-
ment of her charming head, indicated that the pack in the right-
hand corner would be the one to try. All this in a second. It flashed
across me that the Spider and the Mouse had been trained by the
Gaoler. That they are, so to speak, “his creatures.” Ifollowed
the girl's advice and chose the pack in the right-hand corner.
Gºlº tººd pale, Asked me, if I wasn't mistaken; I replied,
politely, “’No,” and presented him with the Ace! / There were no
other aces turned up, and he had to pay me on all. A double per
pack, was, for fourteen packs, fourteen doubles, that is, twenty-eight
roubles. I asked him for the mone playfully, and said, by way
of a jeu de mot, “I’m sorry to t-rouble you for the coin,” He was
wild. He kicked out at the White Mouse, which was innocently
standing on its hind legs in the corner, and sent it flying into its
hole, then threw the three-legged stool at the Spider, who was out
of sight in a jiffey. The s broke the web and the window-
pane, Gaoler wouldn’t play again, but said he would go and get
me the money, as he hadn't, so much about him. Before I could
answer, Isaw his daughter, behind his back, speaking to me in the
dumb alphabet. She said, “Let him go; as he owes you money,
wou won't see him again.” In a secondit flashed across me . . . . .
the one obstacle to my escape was removed. ... I had got rid of
my Gaoler!
Midnight-gaoler departed. Meditating ºn the events of the
evening, I could not help arriving at the conclusion that the Gaoler
must be an uncommonly clever man. But what a pity to see talent
like his so thrown away!. Because really he must have taken, no
end of pains to train the White Mouse and the Spider. And what
could he have got by it? A few roubles from an occasional prisoner.
If I could only have trusted him, I would have proposed a partner-
ship in “a travelling business.” But I am afraid he would be too
suspicious for a partner, . . . . All quiet. From my window I
think I can still see the Governor's eye winking at everything that
is going on under his nose, Hark! From below I hear the splash
of the waters that wash the base of the tower. . . . . On the draw-
bridge I can distinguish the sentinel's tramp and the password for
the night. For strategic purposes it is a kish word—" Bosh.”
“JChiva lä 2" is the question. “Bosh.”. is the answer. “Pass
Bosh, and all’s well!” is the reply, -
The bell of the old Kromesky (the name of a chapel belonging
to the Tartar Dissenters), sounds two. Then all is still - -
I lean against the prison-bars, and wonder whether . . . . Hark!
. . . . A º layed pianissimo . . . and the tune. . . .
“Oh Leonora Addio !” from Trovatore , , , , so suggestive-
Leonora outside, Manrico within ...... I am, Manrico within, and
I commence the strain: then the quick part (Leonora's portion) is
taken up, outside, by the organ. Why not by the human voice?
Because, clearly, it is somebody who can't sing, or who has not got
a human voice. Through the pane of glass, broken by the Gaoler in
his passion, I stretch out, and see, leaning inst the outside wall;
an awkward female figure, in an old-fashioned. º: bonnet,’
º: a small organ. I recognise the organ—it is the one that we
ave never parted with on our tour, it having been invariably used
for accompaniment to the Pig's performance, and it was the handle
of this I had taught the Pig himself to turn... . . It is the Pig . . .
disguised in the poke bonnet . . . . the in the Poke!! . . . . .
He sees me, and in the moonlight spreads the letters out before him,
“Escape, by Private Wire.”. Suddenly, under my nose, comes
up the side of the tower, the Wire, I fasten it to the top bar.
stop for one moment to put the cards and the White Mouse in m
ocket (he seemed to implore so hard not to be left behind), an
escend the Wire..., , ; , I am descending slowly but surely . . . .
and writing this with the other hand so as not to lose time . . . .
As I º own I catch sight of the Governor's eye, through the
slit in the wall, winking at my escape. . . . . Bless him! . . . . In
the court-yard the Governor's carriage, the Gaoler's Daughter, the
Pig in disguise, and the barrel-organ are waiting. Not a moment
is to be, lost; ; ; ; We gain the first drawbridge. . . . “Khiva
läf "... “Bosh!” I reply, imitating the Governor's voice (I shall
add “Imitations” to my Entertainment, on my return). “Pass
Bosh, and all's well!” . . . .
Once again we are challenged . . . . same business as before
. . . . at last we are out on the high road . . . . and free!!
But ! as the Pig says on his letters, “we have now a squeak
or it.
IN COURT.
HE_other day at Croydon, a
Widow Lady was courted,
at least County-Courted, for
forty-seven pounds, which
trifling sum was owing for
five bonnets which she had
lately bought. Whereon the
learned judge remarked:—
“Forty-seven pounds for five
bonnets! Why, that is nearl
ten pounds a-piece! . . . It
seems to me wicked and repre-
$$ hensible extrav ce. he
price of one of these articles
should be sufficient to dress a
lady well.”
.." Wicked and reprehen-
sible extravagance.” Surely
these are hard words to
throw at a lady in a public
court of justice. Might the
widow not have pleaded that
she only wished to show how
dear she was likely to be to
any daring second husband
who dared to take her to
wife?

STRANGELY MISTAKEN.
AN indignant veteran evidently of an age at which indignation
easily overbears intelligence, and who, writes from the House of
Commons, has so utterly misconceived the drift of an article in the
last number of Punch, entitled “Gold-Sticks and Old Sticks,” as to
explode in the following letter:— -
“The article in Punch, holding up to public ridicule the supposed infirmi-
ties of the gallant veterans who have just received the Marshal's bâton as a
reward after a long life spent in the service of their country, is a disgrace and
an infamw.
4. º any other country this outrage would meet with severe punishment.
Here, however, at least, public opinion will reprobate, the cowardly and un-
English crime.”
Till Punch read this letter he would have thought it impossible
for ſany one, to suppose that the objects of ridicule in this
article were the “gallant yeterans” who have done, their country
long and service, and not, first, the system, which postpones
what should be the honours and rewards of these gallant veteranstill
their recipients are on the brink of the f". and, secondly, the
abuse which confers, such honours and rewards not on, the
gallant veterans who have spent long lives in the service of their
country,” but on those who have never faced worse dangers than
those of a drawing-room, and whose lives have been spent rather in
the functions of a flunkey—if one of a gorgeous and grandiose
kind—than the duties of a soldier.

This, by the way, is done now-a-

A. Yes, MR. A.—which stands for
Author—has not been considered at
all in this question. I confess that,
under certain conditions, I too
should like to see variety the rule
at all our theatres, and not the ex-
ception. But when we come to the
argumentum ad pocketum, how am I
to get my living P for I do not wish
to cede my present rights for the
mere sake of putting WycHERLY,
WANBRUGH, CoNGREVE, FARQUHAR,
or even SHAKSPEARE and SHERIDAN,
on the stage everywhere. I am
aware that for the performance of
these works the Managers of to-day
have no fees to pay; and as a matter
of business, if the plays of these
ancients bring grist to the modern
mills, I could not blame a Manager
for obtaining the biggest possible re-
turn for the smallest possible outlay.
L. But, Sir, a modern dramatic
author who achieves a success is
well remunerated.
A. Is he? I am not aware of it
except in accidental cases. Where a
Manager makes a fortune by onl
one piece, its Author receives suc
an amount per week as now-a-days
scarcely equals the salary of a fair
low comedian. When Miss MUFF
and MR. NoDDY talk about High
Art and constant change on the
boards, they are preaching empty
ockets to the modern dramatist in
ngland. A good play is worth
what it will bring. And with such
an enormous population as is repre-
sented by “London,” a good play
that “takes the Town” may go on
until the last boy in the top gallery
shall have expended his uttermost
farthing. Depend upon it, the public
will not pay for what it does not
want, and thus yariety is very soon
forced on both Manager and Author,
who, in my opinion, should be at a
roportionate risk. When this plan
been adopted, I have known the
Author receiving thousands in one
instance, and in another, a few
pounds. Both sums fairly repre-
sented the value of the piece in the
public opinion at that time. They
manage these things better in
France, and the consequence is that
there, Authors, differently gifted,
gan afford to collaborate, and to
bestow such time and care on a piece
as is almost impossible, except at a
considerable sacrifice, with us. When

PARNELL’S GUIDE TO PARLIAMENT.
LAST week MR., PARNET.I., delivered a Lecture, on
“Parliamentary Behaviour,” before an audience of whom
MR. BIGGAR was the Chairman. In the course of the
proceedings the English. Members were denounced as
‘snobs,” and the Irish, Home-Rulers not excepted, were
accused of various offences. We hear that the suc-
cess which attended this maiden effort of MR. PARNELL
to shine as a Parliamentary teacher, is likely to lead to
the publication by him of a Hand-Book of Parlia-
mentary Etiquette. Of this very instructive manual
Mr. Punch subjoins some specimens from a copy sup-
plied by the courtesy of the publisher:-
When you enter the House, talk as loudly as you
can, and, if R. have a personal altercation with a
brother Member about your seat. - -
If you arrive before prayers have been said, whistle
during the ceremony. , . -
Always be prepared with a stock of questions upon
subjects of the most frivolous character. In putting
these questions to Ministers make your speeches as long
and as offensive as you can. , If you can accuse innocent
persons wrongfully so much the better. Explanations
consume time, if they do not always afford amusement.
Interrupt the most useful and ...]". speeches with
the coarsest objections, and shout and hoot whenever an
opportunity is afforded to you. .
É. every day in the House with MR. BIGGAR.
When not engaged actively in debate, haunt, the
Smoking-room and the Library, to the great delight of
your fellow Members.
Whenever you catch the SPEAKER's eye consume as
much time as possible in reading lengthy extracts from
ancient Blue-Books.
Should the Leader of the Party you pretend to serve
venture upon remonstrating with you write letters to
the Papers impugning his honesty and patriotism.
Meefevery attempt at useful Legislation with frivolous
objection and vexatious opposition.
n fact, make up your mind that the House of Com-
mons is composed of snobs, and keep up that belief in
yourself and others by taking every possible and im-
possible opportunity of behaving like an arrant snob
yourself!

FRENCEI CELAMBER-MUSIC.
CHAMBER-MUSIC, well played, is delightful. But French
Chamber-Music can be anything but pleasant, when, according to
ear-witnesses, it consists of sounds like these:-
“The Left howled and hooted, the Right barked and bellowed, Members
fiercely shook their fists, and shouted at each other in a din of uncouth noises,
which the President in vain attempted to subdue.”
If our M.P.'s wish to emulate such performances, they had better
exchange St. Stephen's for the Isle of Dogs.
But we sincerely hope such Chamber Concerts will be never
popular on this side of the Channel, where we prefer our own
serene “Monday Pops,” to ping the Parliamentary Question in
the rude and rampagious ion of which conflicting parties in
the French Chambers have lately been setting the example, pitch-
ing into each other “Right and Ł: ”—or, as we say, in the same
sense—“hammer and tongs.”

married fifty years, and they would be glad if the Board would help them to a
small trifle to celebrate the ‘golden’ day. The letter concluded– By so

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 301
MR. PUNCH's SELECT COMMITTEES.
No. IW,-ON CHARITABLE ENTERTAINMENTS,
MRs. Fussleton FURBELow examined.
I AM not mis-
taken, you have
spent a great deal
of time in organ-
ising charitable
entertainments?
4. Avery large
amount of time,
indeed. In fact,
so much atten-
tion have I given
to the work, that
I have been ac-
cused (behind my
back, of course)
of having sacri-
ficed the comfort
of my husband's
home to the welfareoftheOublic.
Q. Then in your case §
does not begin at home?
4: Such seems to be the
opinion of my friends and ac-
qualmitances.
Q. at are the Charities
you seek to support?
4. As a rule, Hospitals; al-
º if I can find a fashion-
able Fund, I am nearly as well
- pleased.
Q. What are the Entertainments you organise on behalf of
these Funds and Hospitals? -
A. Balls, fancy'fairs, and amateur.theatricals.
Q. How do you get up a ball?
4; I secure the patronage of as º, Ladies of title as possible.
I obtain this º by writing, in the first place, an obsequious
letter, in the name of the Charity, to a Duchess, asking her Grace
to have the benevolence to permit her name tº * upon the list
of patronesses. I point out the excellence of the Charity whose
cause I am espousing, and hint that upon her Grace's decision
depend the health an hº of thousands... If my application
is successful, I use her Grace's consent as a lever to work upon
Ladies of aristocratic longings, and lower degree. If the Duchess
refuses, I pursue the same, course with a Marchioness, and so on,
until I can head my list with half-a-dozen high-sounding titles.
Q. What is your next step P -
4. To fill up my list of patronesses with Ladies who will be able
to dispose of a large number of tickets.
Q. Do you find any difficulty in managing this?
4. No. My list is published in the daily papers, and, knowing
this, MRs. BRowNJoNESDE Robinson is but too pleased to belong to a
Committee headed by the DUCHESs of DEHAUTVILLE and ..".
CHIONESSEs of PLANTAGENET and BRANNEwTo.N.
Q. What is a Fancy Fair?
4. A hall or pleasure-ground filled with booths, in which all
sorts of worthless articles are sold at fancy prices.
Q. Who are the saleswomen?
4. Frisky matrons and maidens, who have seen many seasons,
with as many attractive fast or fashionable girls as they can induce
to act as decoy-ducks at their stalls.
Q. What is the object of a Fancy Fair?
A. Under the guise of charity to obtain the maximum of flirtation
with the minimum of surveillance.
Q. What style is found most attractive on the part of the stall-
keepers on these occasions?
A. The deportment of the barmaid at a refreshment buffet much
affected by City clerks. -
Q. I believe you said that charitable entertainments sometimes
took the form of amateur theatricals P
4. Yes, that is a very popular channel of charity, indeed.
Q. How do you organise an amateur performance?
A., I first secure the services of a troupe of young men whose self-
confidence is greater than their discretion. Such troupes are chiefly
recruited from the idler branches of the Civil Service, the more
*...* sections of the Bar, and the more fashionable corps of the
my.
Q. What are the A. of an Amateur Actor P
4. I only know of one that can be called indispensable and un-
**ś. conceit.
Q. Having collected your troupe, what is your next * ?
This is a matter of no small
A. To arrange my programme.
difficulty, for the ambition of amateurs, as a rule, varies inversely
with, their ability, and each invariably wants to play a piece in
which each individually may appear in the principal part. Great
firmness is necessary; and a piece should be selected in which all
the parts are of about equal length and importance.
Q. Then the merits of a play would have nothing to do with your
selection ?
A. Nothing. My object would be to soothe the jealousy of the
amateurs, to make Jon Es believe that he had a better part than
RoBINSoN, and ToMPKINs think that he had a greater share of the
business of the scene than BROWN,
Q. Having arranged your programme, what would you do next?
A. I would then leave . troupe to rehearse as little as they
liked, and to quarrel as much as they found unavoidable, until the
day fixed for the exhibition of the result.
Q. Leaving pecuniary fruits out of the question, what do you
believe to be the chief results of amateur theatrical performances?
A. In London to develop conceit and impair the taste for good
acting ; in the country, to damage the provincial Managers.
Q. You have answered my questions with such frankness that
º upon one more. Will you kindly give a definition of
charity
A. Certainly, Charity is a virtue which (in all matters of taste,
and especially entertainments) covers a multitude of sins.

EARISHNEss is a natural attribute even of Russ Royalty. (Lords,
Monday, June 25.) Colon EL WELLESLEY, our military attaché
at St. Petersburg, has somehow made himself disagreeable to the
GRAND DUKE NICHOLAs—how, it has not been made public—and
the Grand Duke has shown it at head-quarters in a way which
the English Colonel resented as an English Colonel, and, above all
- one bearing the name of WELLESLEY, should, and it is to be hoped
always will. . When Colonels and Grand Dukes who are, besides, military attachés of an Embassy and Commanders-in-Chief, clash, the
storm, is serious, even though in a teacup—if such things as teacup-tempests can be conceived possible in such, elevated regions,
It is therefore satisfactory to learn that the storm has blown over, that young NICHOLAs has been brought to his bearings, and that
CoLongº WELLESLEY has been able to resume his uniform and his place at head-quarters. It is to be º that the storm will clear the
alr. d º: course, as Britons, we are bound to take it for intº that the Grand Duke has been in the wrong; and we have fulfilled
our duty.
In spite of the united supplications of the ARCHBIshop of CANTERBURY, speaking as the head of the more reasonable Clergy–EARL
HARRowby, speaking as the author of the Clause which killed the DUKE of RICHMOND's Bill, and for its Conservative sup orters—and
EARL GRAN VILLE, speaking for the Liberal Members of the Majority—Government persists in its determination to bury the Burials. Bill.
Like a coroner's jury, they mean to sit upon the body in the Recess. Sensible people feel and say they had better accept the inevitable.
Sensible people should bear in mind how hard it is for a Conservative Government, even in the name of the inevitable, to fly in the
face of twelve thousand clerical supporters. -
(Commons.)-Cleopatra's Needle begins to loom large upon us. To-night LoRD ERNEST BRUCE—it needed a BRUCE,...and an
earnest one, too, to tackle such a big thing—asked First Commissioner MR. NoFL if the Government had made up its mind where to
ut,it. It is satisfactory to know the Government has not. Two sites are suggested on the Embankment; one opposite Northumber-
d Ayenue-vice the Percy Lion with the poker-tail deposed; the other near St. Stephen's Club. At mention of the second the
Opposition Benches “cheered ironically” (Punch has been racking his brains for the §. of the irong, and fails to find one in any
permutations or combinations he can make out of Club and Needle, Cleopatra and St. Stephen's, more brilliant than the obvious anti-
thesis of sharp and blunt, saint and sinner); and two near Westminster Palace; one opposite Abingdon Street, the other in the centre of
the oratorical quadrilateral in Parliament Square.

[JULY 7, 1877.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Punch fails to find a fitness in any of these four sites to compare
with that of the oft-suggested one in Threadneedle Street-provided
always that the Old Lady of that street does not utterly decline
association with anything suggesting Egyptians. But what if we are
§: to annex Egypt? Would there not be, in that case, some-
hing very appropriate in the juxtaposition of Cleopatra's Needle
—an obelisk from the º of the God Tum, the Rising Son of
Egypt—and the Bank of England, symbolising, association of the
rich but out-at-elbows Realm of Nile, with the Old Lady who
represents British wealth and British credit all the world over ?
The City, too, would see a symbol of the successful floating of
Egyptian Stock by British Capital in the floating over of the stone
of Tum by the skill of an English Engineer set to work by the
liberality of an English Physician.
The Porte does not mean to allow Russian ships of war to enter
the Suez Canal. As the Russian Government has distinctly de-
clared that her war-ships will give the Canal a wide berth, this is a
perfectly safe undertaking.
The Admiralty declines a Select Committee to "sit on the In-
flerible...They have put the stability of, the ship to a better test
than sitting on her. They have set an exact model of her afloat
in a big tank, in which, after her unarmoured ends are filled with
water up to the beams, she still floats like a duck with all her
| fighting and sea weights aboard, and shows no disposition to turn
from duck to turtle. MR. REED says he has seen the model, and that
it “distinctly does not represent the danger of the ship.” The
Constructor of the Admiralty contends that it distinctly represents
not her danger, but her safety, which is the important matter.
The Admiralty Čonstructors would hardly be such fools as to falsify
their model under MR. REED's nose; and it is difficult to believe
that MR. REED means to charge the Department with such dirty
*†, That point, at least, must be cleared up; and when it is
settled, as no doubt it will be, in favour of the Admiralty, all dis-
putes about the Inflexible should be at an end before the fact that
she floats—though it be but in the Admiralty Tank, instead of the
broad or narrow seas.
When a Royal Warrant was issued by LoRD, CARDw ELI's Com-
mission in 1872 to give First Captains of Artillery and Engineers
field-officers' rank and pay, the º ia Office grumbled on the score
of the additional cost this would throw on Indian revenue, in the
case of Indian service—amounting to some £40,000 a year. Accord-
ingly, they have never paid First Captains of Artillery and Engineers
the pay and allowances of Field Officers of the Line. The grievance
being brought forward by Colonel JERVIs, the India Office (present
and past represented by the union of Lord G. HAMILTON and SIRG.
CAMPBELL) and the War Office (present and past by §. for
the nonce, of MR. HARDY and MR. CAMPBELL-BANNERMAN) resisting
the demand, Government were defeated by 145 to 93; and on the
yote being challenged by SIR. G. CAMPBELL, the defeat was repeated
by 104 to 56. So you see a House can be made on an Indian ques-
tion. ...But it must be when the fight is over the rights and wrongs
of Artillery First Captains by scores, not of nameless and friendless
Natives by millions.
MR. Holms made one of his wild and whirling attacks on the
Army as it is—or rather, he would say, as it is not—including in his
fell swoop, its recruiting, its desertions, its management, its punish-
ments, its term of service in the Ranks and the Reserve, and ending
by a Motion for robbing the Army of its bone and sinew by passing
into the Reserve at least five thousand soldiers over thirty years of
age and ten years of service. All the military authorities in the
ouse, differing, as they do, on all other points, were unanimous in
condemning this wild º: and MR. HARDY had an easy
task in demolishing MR. Holyſs's unsubstantial facts and inac-
curate figures. In truth (as MR. HARDy said), if MR. Holms had
carried his assertions to their proper conclusion, it would have come
to nothing less than impeachment of two Secretaries of War, and
reversal of our whole Military System. Member for Hackney!
Say, rather, “Member for Hobby! ” But really MR. Holms has
ridden his Military Misadventure Hobby too far. There should be
a limit to the over-riding even of Hobbies. , Shall they be left quite
beyond the pale of the Cruelty to Animals Act f
Tuesday (Lords).-London Solicitors have been accustomed to
shoot their arrears into the Surrey Assize Cause Lists. Somebody
objects; not the County, nor the Solicitors, nor the Suitors; pro-
§§ the Judges. At any rate, the result is that the practice is to
be discontinued, and Surrey Juries are to deal justice, or as much
of it as can be put into process of law, on sins of Surrey only,
Commons (Morning Sitting). —Some stirring of highly offensive
matter between MR. WHALLEY, the SolIGITOR - GENERAL, and
LoRD SANDoN. When we say that it involved the confessional and

Judicature Bill, in which the Gemini of Irish obstructiveness—

(Evening Sitting.)–Long discussion of the Treasury dealings
with a Scotch Intestate's estate, which has fallen to the Crown,
there being no heir-at-law, owing to the illegitimacy of the In-
testate. The exercise of the Crown right was supported by 197 to
135. The Treasury may well be proud of having got £40,000
out of a canny Scot; and we can't wonder they are loth to let
it go.
f did not need MR. LEATHAM's eloquence to enforce the scandal
brought on the Church by the Sale of Livings. But it is easier to
descant on the evil than to suggest a remedy. No doubt a remedy
will have to be found if the Church is to survive this and her
other ailments; but, in the meantime, where is the money to come
from to buy off the owners of the two thousand livings in the
market, and the rest waiting to come forward?. And, supposing
patrons, paid off, who is to exercise the right of appointment in
their stead? What would church or Country gain by vesting cures
of souls and easy berths of bodies in the Church to be dispensed by
her Bishops, or in the State, to be flung broadcast by her LoRi,
CHANGELLORP Private patrons at least; secure for us varieties of
species in the genus Parson....All that is possible for the present
seems to be to bring the Bull's-eye (for what is Public Opinion but
BUIL's eye?) on the practises of patronage, and the buying and
selling of advowsons, and to keep the scandal within the strictest
bounds of decency that Public Opinion can secure.
Wednesday:-MR. R. SMYTH's Irish Sunday-Closing Bill talked
out by its Irish opponents. An Irish measure, if not an Irish man,
being to be roasted, there were the Irishmen, as, usual, turning
the spit. Punch, as the consistent opponent of all such coercive
legislation, cannot regret that its advocates have not an Irish Sunday-
Closing Act to set up beside the Scotch one. He is also glad to see
that the opponents of the Bill did not include BIGGAR and PARNELL,
which is much in favour of the Opposition.

I BUILT myself a lordly picture-place
Wherein to play a Leo's part.
I said, “Let others cricket, row, or race,

With porphyry columns faced,
Hung round with pictures such as I thought good,
Being a man of taste.
The pictures—for the most part they were such
Ti." º: than §: ti - h

The dismal, and the dry. -
One seemed all black and grey—a tract of mud,
One gas-jet glimmering there alone;
Above, all fog; below, all inky flood;
For subject—it had none.
One showed blue chaos flecked with falling gold,
e Danaë's tower in dark; -
A painter's splash-board º more meaning hold
Than this aesthetic lark.
And one; a phantom form with limbs most lank,
Adumbrated in ink and soot;
The Genius of Smudge, with spectral shank
And unsubstantial boot.
Northese alone, but many a canvas bare,
Fit for each vacuous mood of mind,
The gray and gravelike, vague and void, were there
Most dismally designed.

Or two wanlovers in a curious fix, .
Wreathed in one scarf by some queer charm,
Upon the margin of a caverned Styx
Stood shivering arm-in-arm. ...
Or by a garden-prop, posed all askew
, Neath apples bronze, with brazen hair,
A chalk-limb'd Eve and snake of porcelain blue,
Exchanged a stony stare.
Or crowding round one pool, from flowery shelves,
A group of damsels bºwed the knee -
Over reflections solid as themselves, -
And like as peasen be.
Or mythic Uther's diddled son was seen -
Packed in a trunk, with crampèd limbs awry,
Spell-fettered by.a. Siren limp and lean,
And at least twelve heads high.

Would pick from Mythus' shadowy realm, were there,
With ample space assigned *

And full-red lips-and-shocks of fulvous hair, "

Then my eyes filled, my talk waxed large and dim
Of BotticeLLI's deathless fame:
“Quaint immaturity to reach with him,”
I cried, “is Art's true aim.
“To plunge, self-blinded, in the mystic past,
That makes the present small:
If eyes artistic be not backward cast,
Why have we eyes at all?”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
DIARY OF MY RIDE To KHIVA.
(Communicated by Private Wire.—Thrilling Adventures.)
Y KHIVAN Karavan now consists of the
Pig and Alphabet in the boot, (beau-
tiful si or an old Inn, “The Pig
and Alphabet,”) with the barrel-organ
(which was instrumental in my escape
from º the Gaoler's Daughter in
rumble, the Sleigh-driver's Boy who
has stuck to me from the commence-
ment, and it grieves me to be unable
to reward.such fidelity by paying him
his wages—but, after all, this only
increases the obligation on my part;
and, as I explained to him, “You see,
my lad, I am so far from my native
land.” Then there’s my new horse.
It was the Governor of the Prison's
horse, or the horse of the Governor of
the Prison, or the horse of the Prison's
First Russian Exercises). A better or truer mare
was never foaled. Lastly, there's my latest novelty, which accompanied me, in my pocket,
from prison—The Musical Mouse.
Slight jealousy between the Learned Pig and the Musical, Mouse. Whenever the Pig
begins to practise with his letters (as he has to do every day), the Musical Mouse begins to
whistle and sing, just to put him out, and make him wild. "This annoys the Pig, who spells
things wrong, and doesn't answer questions properly. Consequently, I am obliged to beat the
Pig...Whereupon he grunts piteously, and spells out, “Cuss that Mouse!” If I could only
smooth matters oyer, and bring them together, it would be a fortune!
The Mouse is invaluable in tricks with cards, having been trained by the Gaoler, who used
to cheat his prisoners, the old villain. The Mouse—I’ve christened him." Ridiculus Mus-
urus Bey” (and “assisted by HERE GRÜNTz” will look well in the bill—if I can only bring
them together!). -

gradually becoming less and less in the distance, under the genial influence of the sun.
3:30 P.M.–Distant mountãins melted. First view of Khiva. See distinctly the name over
the gate. Gaoler's Daughter comes out of tent.
... Strange, to º; apler, and his daughter had invariably paid their visits to my cell,
either in what she º termed “the gloaming,” or, late at night, and as the small
dipskis (little tallow candles) didn't give much light, I had never really seen her by day.
Now I do see; her by day, I should say that her ather must have been weii over seventu,
and must have married tery early. I begin to regret the Unfair Circassian. ~.

of an elderly, half-paid, underfed Turnke

will love thee always as much as I do now,”
which was strictly true. . (For, need I say
it, the Poll of my heart is at home, and
my heart is true to Poll, I bless her dear
eyes! And she's just come into a little
fortune, so I hear; but this makes no differ-
ence to me.)
10.-Constructed a new frigidometer with
an empty bottle, a cork, and a piece of
string. (Principle patented.) Frost set in
hard. Mountains shaping up to points.
Gaoler's daughter, feverish. Sobbing. What
shall I do? I offered to pack up, ride off,
and fetch a doctor from Khiva.
“And leave me here?” she exclaimed,
furiously. “Why, you pitiful, underbred,
overfed son of an eighty-four-tonner l’
she cried, becoming, I regret to say,
abusive.
I remonstrated. She called me “A son
of a marine gastronome !” and threw a boot
at me. Row. I pointed out that I had
meant well. She gradually calmed down.
10:30,-Bitter cold-snow, ice, sleet. Sat
in to supper. Wickski and explanation. I
make wickski cobler. We ice it in snow,
and, suck it up through straws. (Shall
teach Pig to sit in chair and suck wickski
cobler through a straw.) We sit on the
bank of the river (the Oxus, I suppose,
judging by the position of the stars, as
I’ve lost my maps), sipping our wickski
coblers, she and I.

“We sat by the river, she and I,
In the happy days when we were young.”
The barrel-organ is by my side, and all is
peace and harmony. More wickski cobler,
more straws. Ha! do I see * way out
of it? 'Tis the last straw that breaks the
Cobler's back . . . . Good. The last strawl
She sleeps! My Lady sleeps!! Hooray!
Now to pack up !, and off!!. Away to

A trill—a sweet, sweet trill . . . . a
warble . . . . . . . The Gaoler's Daughter
awakes. “What is it?” she murmurs.
Not to rudely . answer her, I. reply,
“Nothing.” This does not satisfy her;
We listen. Trilling as of a sweet bird
continuing.
“Hal” she exclaims, a little more than
half awake, “it is the Song of the Mud-
lark.” - - -
We are beside the river, and the tide is
low.
“And how shall I catch the Mudlark P’’
I asked, as I pensively ground the organ

with which my accompaniment was in
perfect harmony. If I could only have

to plunge into the mud after the Mud-
lark .... perhaps : . . . . Well, perhaps,
'she might not have been able to catch that

singing all night.”
“Pig,” I replied (on the Letters), with
grim humour, for I was determined not to
give in to his whim, “Pig, you’re a bore '"
He squeaked, and gave a sort of half-
laugh, as only pigs can, and retired. To
express it, humanly speaking, the Pig
smiled, but never forgave the satire.

LET bigots write with sneers of spite,
And dogmas argue so, ... .
Let priests and parsons, differing, fight,
As 'tis their nature to.
But, Sages, §: should never let
Such female passions rise;
Your thinking minds were never made
To bandy taunts unwise.
Let calm through all your questions run,
All your debates be mild;
Keep your discussions, every one,
By rancour undefiled.
With patience gentle as a lamb
Your arguments pursue;
Call not each other's theories “flam,”
But prove the sounder view.
Look up to Truth all ends above;
Seek that and that alone:
Nor squabble, out of mere self-love,
O'er crotchets of your own.
