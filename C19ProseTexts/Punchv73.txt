TTIS sleepless ear to the central car-piece of the World-Telephone whose ramifications converge in Purch's Cabinet, the
II Great Teacher sat and listened. He heard the slow, stertorous breathing of 1877, the year of blood, as he fought his
way painfully to his last gasp. He listened for Christmas and New Year's Bells. In vain. He heard only the roll of cais-
sons, the boom of guns, the shrieks of wounded and the groans of dying me, the roaring and crackling of burning villages,
and—worse than all—the low wailing of houseless women and starving babes.
With a heavy sigh he shut off his telephone-tube. “I will hear no more," he said.
“ But you must," said Toky. “Not through that pipe of ill-omen, but by word of mouth. They are all here. They
will see and speak with you."
« They? Who?"
“ The Czars and Kaisers, the Kings and Cardinals—the pivots of the world's working."
“ Tell them at least to wait for the meeting of Parliament."
“ They say they want Wisdom, not Words."
“Let them, at all events, await the revelation of Ministerial intentions."
“ They want advice how to act, not contradictory reasons for not actiog."
And before Punch could bar the entrance of the Adytum, the consulters of the Oracle were before him—the Crowned
Heads of Europe, the Red-hatted Heads of the Church-suppliant, submissive—waiting to be told what to do, and how to do it.
“We will follow our Protestant order of precedence, if you please," said the Oracle. “ Crowns before Tiara. You
Temporal Sovereigns are here to consult Me on the important point in Europe's Christmas dioner-How to CARVE THE
TURKEY.”
The Crowned Heads meekly bowed assent.
“And you, Red-hatted Heads of the Church, would be glad of a lead in your choice of a successor to my excellent,
though infallible, old friend, Pio Nono ?”
The Red Hats inclined, for once unanimous.
“ How do you elect to speak ?”.
“By our totems !” exclaimed the Crowned Heads; "the beasts and birds who represent us in our coats of arms."
“ And admirably they represent you, I must say," rejoined the Oracle, courteously. “As for the carving of the
Turkey-you will pardon me for reminding you that the bird is not dead yet, and I fancy my friend ALEXANDER will find

voice. “And though I should be the last to press my own claim to so much as a drumstick, still, after all the hard fighting
I have had, I must naturally expect my little pickings, disinterested as I am known to be, and purely Christian as my
motives must be admitted to be—for a Bear."
“Nothing can be more reasonable," rejoined the Oracle ; "and, provided the Bear does nothing to block the Lion's
road to India, I really don't see why your respective interests or appetites need clash."
“Of course we don't want a slice !” shrieked two large Black Eagles, one single, the other double-headed. “But in the
meantime," continued the one with two heads, “ if you would only tell me how to keep my two heads from quarrelling "
“And how about our share ?” struck in the Servian Buzzard, the Greek Kite, and the spirited little Montenegrin
Sparrow-Hawk.
“Really, my feathered friends, I am afraid that whatever trouble you may have had with the living Turkey, the
carving of the dead bird is likely to cost you as much difficulty. I must, for the present, decline the task of assiguing
your respective portions. My one counsel to you is not to cross the Lion's path, or to leave him out of any arrangement you
may make; or you may find that his claws are sheathed not snipped, and his teeth none the loss sharp that he is in no way
forward to show them—for all the kind friends who are so ready to roar for him, and so prompt to poke him up.".
“ This is scarcely the counsel we came for,” growled the Bear.
“ It is the best I can give you," curtly replied the Oracle. “And now for you, most reverend Red Hats ! If you can find
one among you able to read the signs of the times, and less disposed to rely on Papal infallibility than secular sense, concen-
trate your votes on him, and leave the Church and the World to find a modus vivendi, instead of a modus internecandi, as

“Is that all the guidance you have to give us ?” sighed the Red Hats.

Crushingly fell that weight of wisdom on the untrustworthy substratum of Crowns-for even those made of iron, and
cemented with blood, were honeycombed. Not one but collapsed ; some with an elasticity that gave hopes of restoration to

ETTER watch-dog of Standing Orders than LORD REDESDALE it
were needless to wish. (Monday, July 2.) The Lords have a
"Standing Order” that Bills for confirming Provisional Orders
shall not be read a Second Time after a certain day in July.
This Standing Order is a case of “lucus a non lucendo." It is
not allowed to stand, but is shoved on one side, by leave of the
House, whenever it stops the way. LORD REDESDALE complains
that "parties” have not their Bills ready earlier. “Parties"
would do well to take the hint. But“Confirming Bills" are not
the only ones that hang fire-thanks sometimes to other parties,"
and generally to causes beyond "parties',"' control. If "parties” were more under control, Legislation, altogether, would be easier work.

nights questions! To skim the long list is to “survey mankind from China to Peru." From this “wonderful bottle" we draw what every
one will be glad to know, that the Russian Bear's sore head is better, and COLONEL WELLESLEY once more a persona grata (construe, not

shunted at sixty-seven, though he is as good across country as ever, or the grievances of Army Surgeons ? Let him refer to Monday's
Parliamentary Report. As well try to summarise a chapter of Mangnall's Questions.
The dissatisfaction of the Army Surgeons is a serious matter, for it threatens the efficiency of a most important “Arm” of the
Service—the arm that physics our soldiers in peace, and amputates or bandages them in war. MR. HARDY is impatient of these
grievances, which find a voice in PLAYFAIR and LUSH. 'LUSH is scarce the help to fall back on, but PLAYFAIR in the House may assist the
Surgeons of the Service to fair play out of it. MR, HARDY declares they have had more than fair play. The Surgeons don't think so,
and this is shown by the small number of competitors for Commissions. If Army Surgeons have had all the honours and advantages
heaped on them which MR. HARDY insists on, it is surely odd that Army-Surgeoncies should go a-begging. Men don't usually
turn up their noses at bread so richly buttered—especially in one of the most crowded and fiercely competitive of callings. The Medical
Department declares the Army never had a better Medical Staff than now. It wouldn't be pleasant to have that Staff give way

A CORRESPONDENT, writing to the Times
on the subject of Printing, the Caxton
Celebration, and the Copy of the Oxford
University Press Bible there shown and
puffed (on which Punch has commented in
another article) winds up, firework-fashion,
with the following "bang":-
"As to progressive printing, the Caxton Exhi-
bition demonstrates that direct printing may be
applied from the same block to coarse backing, the
surface of sheet iron, or looking-glass, to print
upon a file or impart a delicate kiss upon an egg
shell. But the greatest marvel of typography is
our Times; practically and truly you could cast
of your linen at one end of a machine to behold
it before your eyes transformed into a journal, the
whole being produced in less time than it would
take a scribe of old to put a new nib to his pen.”
Really, Mr. Luke Limner, this " is a
leetle strong." The idea of MR. WALTER,
or some devoted servant of the Times-
“not Launcelot, but another"-in a dearth
of paper, taking off his shirt at one end of
the machine to come out as the broadest of
broad-sheets at the other-still more of the
conversion of the long cloth into pulp first,
and paper afterwards,-to say nothing of
the mere “machining,”-taking less time
than the mending of a scribe's pen!

It never occurs to this amazing drawer of parallels that for the
Bulgarian atrocities we had the testimony both of English eye-
witnesses of the hideous relics of Batak and Philippopolis, and of the
English gentleman officially charged to investigate the facts, to set
against the audacious lying of the Turkish official report; while for
the alleged Russian atrocities we have as yet no evidence but those
very Turkish official reports, which we know, as a rule, to be
unworthy of credit.
Next, apart from the question of evidence altogether, our common
sense tells us that there is all the difference in the world, as a matter
of justification, between such trivial provocation as alone was ever
proved in the case of the Bulgarian Atrocities and the exigences of
actual war. The burnings and bombardments of an invading army
are blind, and cannot always distinguish between the persons or pro-
perties of avowed enemies and unarmed peasants, between magazines
and hospitals, head-quarters and consulates, particularly where flags
are hoisted at the command of those to whom lying costs nothing.
If the Gentleman of the Pall Mall Gazette cannot see the differ-
ence between the horrors and sufferings which follow the advance
or retreat, the course of attack or defence, of an invading army, and
the massacre and outrage of unoffending women, innocent children,
unarmed peasants, and unoffending priests, to say nothing of the
indescribable horrors far worse than death, which revealed the
utter brutality of the ruling Turks in Bulgaria last year, we find

THE SONG OF SHINDY.
A Paan which Mr. Punch earnestly commends to the attention of
Reformers, Inventors, Practical Philanthropists, and all lovers of
their kind.
I'm the only true child of Old Chaos alive,
But by Science ignored or accepted I thrive.
She is down on Disorder and Dirt, but till now
Seems tolerant still of Unlimited Row.
Men prate about Silence and fight about Peace ;
I am sworn foe of both, and my triumphs ne'er cease.
Art hears me, the Church all my powers employs,
And Progress itself is the patron of Noise.
In the Centres of Commerce I rule and rejoice,
Uplifting a harsh and cacophonous voice
Of incredible compass, from thunder to squeal.
Through roar, rattle, rumble, explosion, and peal,
Thud, clatter, and clash, all the changes I ring
On the gamut of Row; and my voice is a thing
Which to rival in power or shrillness of note
Old Stentor might fruitlessly strain his huge throat.
Poor Music my rival, mine enemy Quiet,
Are nowhere with me in the race of sheer Riot ;
For Silence and Song are but interludes rare
In the Devil's Tattoo that I beat everywhere.
I'm Civilisation's chief Nemesis. She,
Whilst weighted with such an Old Man of the Sea,
Is held, by the wise, mere mechanical welter,
Whose name should be altered to wild Helter-Skelter.
Reform, which lays hands upon everything now,
Has made an exception in favour of Row;
And Satire, which scarifies all that's absurd,
Lets me off with a feeble occasional gird.
A sour SCHOPENHAUER may sometimes protest,
A LEECH or a BABBAGE bewail his lost Fest;
But men in the mass, howsoever annoyed,
Accept me as nuisance that none may avoid.
And yet did but Science and Satire unite
Against me, in earnest to scheme and to fight,
The rule of the last of the tyrants of Man
Would be quickly reduced to a limited span.
Should tolerant tympanums fairly revolt,
I'm afraid I should have to sing small, or to bolt,
Like most later despots, of whom which enjoys
Such irrational rule as preventible Noise ?

a relaxation of the rule that requires those who are learning to teach
to live in Training Colleges. The Scotch Universities are able and
willing to teach teachers, and “my Lords" will facilitate attend-
ance of Queen's Scholars on their classes. But further they decline
to go, and the House, by LORD SANDON's direction, in spite of MR.
FORSTER's plea for Day-Training Colleges, supported the Depart-
ment by 121 to 78-an official majority.
SIR JOHN LUBBOCK asked, on behalf of School Boards and Com-
mittees, for more elbow-room in choice of subjects, and order and
mode of teaching them. He gave abundant illustrations of present
absurdities and palpable improvements in national schooling, as to
which the only question is, if they be possible under present condi-
tions and with existing appliances. Common-sense seems to point
out, that there would be infinitely more use in teaching boys common
gardening, and girls the simplest household work and plainest
cookery, instead of much in the bookwork way that both are now
kept at without learning. It is well that somebody in the House
should call attention to what may or might be done, and clearly
is not done, in this matter. Teachers' pensions; what we have got,
and what we want, in the way of inspectors; the difference between
the number of children who ought to be, and who are at school,
were all brought up, and attention to all promised.
LORD SANDON reported good work doing in the way of that most
urgent of all educational wants-the teaching of Cookery. If the
British workman's broth and the British shopkeeper's joint and
potatoes are spoiled for them, it is certainly not thanks to too many
cooks. All the training-schools can, as it is, appoint teachers of
Cookery. Why don't they?
LORD SANDON asks for close on Two Millions. No two millions of
national outlay will be more readily given, nor will JOHN BULL
grieve to hear that since he first put his hand in his pocket for

Go, self-styled “Priest in Absolution,"
And fitting penance be put through-
Or, owning a base substitution,
At least confess thyself a “doo”!
Go, sham Confessor, self-appointed,
Kneel to a Priest with patent chrism,-
Rome's own original anointed !
To shrive thee of the sin of schism !
Own thee a double-faced backslider
Who ought to join St. Peter's bark;
Too long a heretic misguider,
From LUTHER's light to DENS's dark.
A base deceiver and beguiler
Of silly women, old and young;
A humbug and impostor, viler
Than aught that can be told with tongue.
Humbly beg pardon for exploring,

And, thine own frailties while forth-pouring,
A quack Confessor stand confest!
Solicit of thy ghostly father
A penance worthy thy desert;
One that will incommode thee rather-
An iron belt or horsehair shirt,
Peas in thy boots, or flagellation
Prescribed to merited extent,
Or whate'er worse humiliation
It hath pleased Priest-craft to invent.

Of thine own sins to be released ;

HIELDS have two sides. The two sides of the Irish Shield were held
up (Lords, Monday, July 16)—the black by LORD ORANMORE AND
BROWNE, the white by the DUKE OF MARLBOROUGH, LORD O'HAGAN,
and LORD CARLINGFORD.
On the question of Crime in Ireland, the authority of a Lord-Lieutenant and an ex-Lord Chancellor may well outweigh that of a
High-Tory Irish Peer out of temper with recent changes, and naturally disposed to make the worst of anything that admits of two
constructions. It is satisfactory to know that, bad as things Irish may be in some counties-in agrarian offences especially—they are
much better than they were, and are even now on the mend. The Irish Vebm-Gericht still works, but less widely and less wickedly.
There is no case for increase of gag-and-muzzle law.
(Commons.)- After the usual Monday's Miscellany-out of which a fresh outbreak of Cattle-plague in the unsavoury locality of Bethnal
Green crops up like a hideous apparition—the House did short and sharp sentence on a late appointment.
E pur si muove: all is not stationary, even in that official world where promotion by favour is the rule and promotion by merit the
exception. Wben in jobbing your job you also slap a Special Committee in the face, look out to have the slap returned, and with
interest.
So in this case, after a Select Committee had sat on the Stationery Office, to consider whether there was no remedy, but the House
must groan and sweat under all that weary load of waste-paper, and the cost thereof, and had reported that if that Office could be
provided with a Head that knew something about the matters the Office has to do with, such as red-tape, pens, ink, paper, printing,
and binding-the material and munitions, in fact, of Departmental warfare-savings by the thousand might become the rule, instead of
waste by the waggon-load, they did not mean their recommendation to be treated after the way of the Stationery Office-as waste-
paper, but to be acted upon by the appointment, as the next Controller, of a man who understood the Office work as an expert.
Such a man was at hand, in the second in command. But LORD BEACONSFIELD passed him by, as well as the recommendation of
tbe Select Committee, for a son of an ex-Rector of Hughenden- a very clever and efficient Junior War-Office Clerk, sixty-ninth on
the list, who besides good friends, could plead good service in the Office, and, thanks to both, had basked in much sunshine of

A CLERICAL SUGGESTION.
SOME clever person, in the Lower
House of Convocation, during the
discussion on LORD ALWYNE COMP-
TON'S Motion, as to vestments (re-
ported in the Church Times)
observed, that, “if a white Chas-
able were worn, it really could
hardly be distinguished at a dis-
tance from a surplice with a degree-
hood over it." This is a beautiful
notion for compromise, only a large
church is absolutely necessary.
Then the Ritualistically inclined
among the Laity should have the
front seats, where they would be
satisfied that the Parson was wear-
ing a “ vestment.” Those in the
middle of the Church-representing
the via media-would be uncertain
as to what it was, and as indifferent
as uncertain, while the moderate
Evangelical party in the back seats,
would see only a surplice and a
hood. The ultra Evangelicals might
be easily seated out of sight alto-
gether, and so long as they were
within hearing, they would have to
live by faith, and not by sight, in
perfect accordance with their own
principles. Really the Cleric who
made this observation in Convoca-
tion, and whose name we regret our
inability to recall (as wė only quote

MALEDICTION MADE WORSE.
(TO MR. EDWARD FREEMAN.)
It was not “Perish India," you exclaimed,
"Rather than for the Turk one Briton fight!"
But “Perish British Interests, unshamed,
Rather than we take part against the Right" ?
The second saying gives the worse offence
To the true Briton's moral sense !
If India perished, and if that were all,
The evil were comparatively small.
"India" might "perish” without more ado
Than if you sung out, “Perish Timbuctoo !”
But "British Interests," Sir, and “Our Dominion
In India"-these are things that Britons cherish.
Do rather anything than let them perish!
The man's un-English holds not that opinion.
You, that of FREEMAN bear the glorious name,
Do you yourself a freeborn Briton think,
And yet admit, with soul devoid of shame,
A cause for which you'd "British Interests” sink ?
As Britons paramount we feel 'em.
"Fiat Justitia, ruat cælum.”
That moral maxim, in this freemen's land,
Folk with this free construction understand,
“Let British Interests' reign supreme o'er all,
Although the welkin on the world should fall.”

F we wanted an appropriate title for our se'nnight's chronicle, we
ought to call it "A Week at Donnybrook." It opens with a pleasant
novelty in the Dog-days-a Saturday Morning Sitting (July 21).
And for such an agreeable and useful morning's work, too! Four
hours of obstructive row over the Irish Judicature Bill, resulting in
one division of 90 to 4 on a Motion of MR. BIGGAR'S to postpone a
Schedule. And this, after several rounds of the same weari-
some wrangling in the small hours of Friday's sitting. The only
novelty was that BIGGAR said “What the deuce !” and was called
to order for it. If “What the deuce !” makes BIGGAR's behaviour
disorderly, what the deuce do you call BIGGAR's behaviour without
that energetic form of interrogation ?
The House is rapidly getting into a state of white-heat at this
idiotic annoyance, and no wonder. If it keeps temper enough, under
the provocation of PARNELL, BIGGAB, and O'DONNELL, to pass sen-
tence on these incorrigible offenders with decent judicial dignity, it
will have earned canonisation; for, certainly, they have been enough, this week, to rile a Senate of Saints. There is a limit even to Parlia-
mentary patience; and it has evidently been reached at last. If July does not see the end of this intolerable waste of public time,
and unjustifiable tax on private temper, the House of Commons will have deserved the ignominy to which it is the object of this precious
trio to reduce it. In SIR WILLIAM HABCOURT's words, MESSRS. PARNELL, BIGGAR & Co., will have succeeded in their attempt “to
defy the authority of Parliament, to bring the House of Commons into contempt, and to block the great engine by which the British Empire
is chiefly maintained.” Of course this is what they wish. But ought they to have their wish? It is all very well to treat these persons
with contempt. Contempt, irony, sarcasm, ridicule, are as much thrown away on them as hail on the hide of a rhinoceros. They
must be prevented from further obstructing public business, as you prevent a knot of roughs from stopping a thoroughfare. The rules
of the House were framed for men of sense and Gentlemen, so no wonder a difficulty is found in bringing them to bear on the present
offenders. But if the old rules won't fit, new ones will have to be framed. The nuisance must be abated.
Monday (Lords).-The House in a hush of expectation. Quite a rush of at least a dozen Peers to their places to hear LORD
GRANVILLE-in an awful silence-ask LORD DERBY " whether he could give any explanation respecting the rumoured movement of troops
to the Mediterranean," and to hear LORD DERBY's answer-in a silence as awful—" that the Mediterranean garrisons were below their
full complement; and in the present uncertain and disturbed condition of Europe, it has been thought desirable that they should be
strengthened-to the extent of about 3000 troops. This is the sole foundation for the statements in the newspapers."

Where our own interests feel the smallest pinch?

And brand the statesman of a purer strain
A craven cosmopolitan? Tis gain

Who dares play patriot on a nobler plan;
Who dares be just, fair, mindful of the right,
And only in clear quarrel prone to fight;
Loving of all earth's lands his own the best,
Yet honestly regardful of the rest;
Who lets not beam of wilful bias blind
His judgment frank and fair of all mankind;
Nor seeks, with petty pelting pride upblown,
To mete all human interests by his own.
If that's un-English, then I hope, good friend,
JOHN BULL will be un-English to the end.

To move in wild fear of danger before the summons of

as to lag when it sounds indeed.

THE sorest stress of the Season 's over;
Out of its crush I am lying alone,

With nought to do but absorb ozone-
Should there be ballad more blithe than mine?
Song of a haven-welcoming lover!
Rare rose-scents from our garden blown
Reach me here, and my eyes discover,
Shimmering there, in a tangle thrown,
Sunny locks. “She is coming, my own!”
The green bowers sever, her blue eyes shine.
Sweet love nearing, sore labour flown,-
Should there be ballad more blithe than mine?
What to me though weariness hover
Still o'er Town where the toilers groan ?
Lazy lounger, leisurely lover,
What care I for the Members' moan
At the Irish incubus, heavy as stone ?
For BIGGAR's bullying, WHALLEY's whine ?
Peace unchequered, and care unknown,
Should there be ballad more blithe than mine?

Who have burst the bubble by slumber blown,
And broken a ballad so blithe as mine!
MIGRATION OF SPECIES.
DEAR MR. Ponch,
I must call your attention to the following
paragraph, which appeared in the Globe of July 25th,
under the heading of " Tame Chamois" :-
“Like the Zebra, the Chamois has been looked upon as un-
tameable. . . . But, as the striped beauty of the South American
plains has been made to bowo its neck beneath the yoke, so the
repressive skill of the lord of the creation has at last asserted itself
over the freedom of the chamois.”
Fancy the Zebra being described as “the striped
beauty of the South American plains !” It is really too
awful. I have scarcely yet recovered from the shock.
Yours very painfully,

MORE THAN A MATCH FOR YOU.
MR. PUNCH,
You flatter yourself that, with help of your backing, the
Bishops, Patrons of Livings, Visiting Justices, &c., will be able to
keep us out of Church preferments and functions, by asking us
whether we belong to that Priestly Society which the Erastian
Archbishop calls a conspiracy” against the Church of England,
the members of which should be kicked out of doors by every father
of a family. You are mistaken. We have added a new Rule to
our Statutes, for the relief of such weak consciences as do not yet
see that the question whether we belong to the Society may be met
by the lie direct, followed by plenary absolution. The Rule is
this :-If any member of the Society is asked whether he is a
member thereof, he is, by that question, excluded from the Society,
and can conscientiously answer “No." If he be asked further
whether such a Society exists, the question dissolves the Society,
and he again conscientiously answers “ No.” When the answers
have been accepted by the dull-witted Erastians, the Society
resumes its existence, and the member returns to his place in it, as
before. .
I should like to see either you or LORD PenzANCE drive a coach-
and-four through that Rule. I am, &c.,
Cross-CROSSLET.
All but Parallel.
PARLIAMENTARY parallel plain,
With the least little strain of the compass :-

What the great O'D. understands by “full and fair

of his much exercised mind over the Transvaal transac-

humbleness, followed suit; while MR. KNATCHBULL-
HUGESSEN, MR. E. JENKINS, from the Opposition point
of view, and MR. LOWTHER, from the Official, defended
a transaction, which, however out of the usual line of
English policy, Punch believes with them, to have been
unayoidable, and the means of averting far worse evils
than the worst even an O'DONNELL can lay his tongue to.
SIR J. Hay brought up the DE HORSEY naval duel,
at the un English odds of two to one, Shah and Amethyst
against Huascar. As nobody quite knows the facts, it
would have been wiser to postpone a Parliamentary
action as unsatisfactory as the naval one.

AN UNCOMMON COWARD.
The Standard's Correspondent with the Turkish Army in
Armenia, in temporary default, perbaps, of news more distinctly
warlike, transmits a panegyric upon Turks; in the course thereof
supplying the subjoined information :-
"My new Servant was very willing, and soon showed that he was honest,
but at the same time childish, awkward, and cowardly. The Turks love
their children too much, and spoil them; they do not keep them at work,
and treat them even after their marriage as little children for whom father
and mother must work, and whose faults must be forgiven. Of course, these
faults assume a very grave character in some children; but my Servant is
too cowardly to do an act of violence.”
He, therefore, could never have had a hand in “Bulgarian
Atrocities." He would never have behaved like a brave Bashi-
Bazouk. But what other Servant, except some Irish Gentleman's,
could be described by his Master as too much of a coward to commit
a dastardly act ?

THE CRY OF INDIA.
Can it be that familiarity breeds contempt even of Famine ?
Is it possible that England, horror-stricken as she was into liberal
humanity when, three years since, she first heard of Hunger threaten-
ing some six millions of lives in Behar, has now hardened her heart,
and closed her hand against the news that the same awful presence
is darkening over eighteen millions in Madras alone-to say nothing
of Mysore? We do not, we will not believe it. Is it because England
helped to save so many in the last famine that she cannot yet realise
how many have already fallen, how many will yet fall, in this so
much worse want, and so much wider dearth? She has not yet shaped
into a fact in her rather slow imagination the horrible truth that the
slow sure hand of Hunger has already wiped out of life more than
half a million men, women, and children-the population of Liverpool;
that Pestilence dogs the steps of Famine to glean the blighted life she
leaves; that, if more help be not given than the Indian Government
can give, this huge tale of death may be told twice or thrice over
before the tardy rains have brought up the crops that are to feed
the starving myriads of Madras and Mysore. Help is needed not
only to buy food, but to find and pay agencies for the distribution of
grain and medicine.
Ever first in such work, London has at length lifted the wide
sluices of her bounty, and the stream has begun to flow through.
Let the dribble become a deluge, or rather a vast irrigating fountain
head, whence the life-saving streams of agency and aid in food and
medicine, may be disbursed over the hungry land that in the last
famine had reason to bless the benevolence of England, and let us
hope and pray, may not have reason to ourse her backwardness in this.
GERMS.
(Respectfully addressed to the President of the British Association.)
If ovum ab ovo we grant, in the term
Comprehending as well as egg, seed, spore, and germ,
If all life from an egg sprung at primal creation ;
Nor, save from an egg, know we aught of creation,
Then, granted that germs, whether wafted on breezes,
Or in fluids conveyed, cause zymotic diseases,
Typhoid fevers, for instance, when should they be dated ?
Were the germs of disease with our Cosmos created ?
Or was there but one germ,-0 theory splendid !-
Whence germs of disease with all else have descended ?
In their separate eggs if you catch things, or bive 'em-
“Omne vivum ab ovo "-how came the first " vivum”?
Suppose that the germs that cause typhoid are shed
By live things in sewage developed and bred,
Where abode they in days before cesspools and sewage,
When the young earth was pure of such savoury brewage ?
By what sowers, and where, were these typhoid germs sown,
Long ere man yet existed or typhoid was known?
And did germs, first created all good, by degrees
Get developed through time into germs of disease ?
Were they old as the hills, and the seas, and the shore,
Did they clog the first herbage that Earth ever bore ?
In existence how long had they probably been,
When our pedigree reached the Ascidian Marine ?
These are questions which vainly may puzzle the mind-
But if Doctors from fever can rescue mankind,
Small matter if plague-germs be facts plump and plain,
Or germs that don't germinate save in the brain.

An Order in Council under the Destructive Insects Act, provides
that,
“ If the owner of, or any person having under his charge, any crop of
potatoes or other crop, or vegetable, or substance, finds, or knows to be found,
ihereon, the Colorado Beetle, in any stage of existence, he shall, with all
practicable speed, give notice of the fact of the same being so found to a con-
stable of the police establishment of the place where the same is found. The
constable shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Local Authority, and the
Local Authority shall forthwith give notice thereof, by telegraph, to the
Privy Council.”
In the meantime is the person who first finds the Colorado Beetle
required to squelch him and stamp him out, or else, besides giving
notice of his having been discovered, give him in charge to the
policeman ? Is BOBBY enjoined to destroy him, or bound only to
collar the Colorado Beetle, and take him up, and beyond that, do no
more than run him in ? If so, whilst correspondence concerning
him is going on between the Local Authority and the Privy Council,
may not the Colorado Beetle detained at the station-house contrive
to escape out of custody, and.proceed anew to devour potatoes, and,
with his peculiarly prolific power, diffuse his family over the
fields ?

annihilated, as soon as the naturalists had
finished studying them. But what if the
measures taken against the Colorado Beetle
should fail ? Then would arise the question
which rendered that insect an object of so
much interest to the present assembly; as
they would understand by a passage he
would read them from Land and Water :-
"There is one point we wish to call attention
to-it is the preparing for the dreaded invasion
of the Colorado Beetle by a studied preservation
of its enemies. These enemies are, without doubt,
Rooks. We wish to persuade the owners of
rookeries that by sparing the young Rooks next
spring, they would double the defensive force in
the country against the expected invasion. Spare
the rook and you will stamp out the beetle. The
rook is the true beetle-crusher.' (Cheers.)"
It was an ill wind that blew nobody good,
and the advent of the Colorado Beetle
would, if Land and Water were right, be
doubly advantageous to Rooks. Whilst
gaining them protection, it would yield
them food. But was Land and Water right
upon that point ? Could they eat the Colo-
rado Beetle in its larva state, as they ate the
Cockchafer? Was it nice? That was the
question.
The President could not say. Land and
Water argued from the Cockchafer to the
Colorado Beetle; and certainly the larva of
the former, as well as that of the latter,
devoured potatoes. But the Cockchafer
grub had, as they knew, the peculiarity of
being very oily and fat ("Hear! hear.!"),
which made that grub particularly good
grub (laughter), and indeed some utili-
tarians had suggested that it might be
rendered an article of human food. Now
nobody had proposed to eat the grub of the
Colorado Beetle. It might be nice and
beaksome-and it might not. ?
Rook No. 3 had read in a newspaper
that for gatherers the Colorado Beetle was
a nasty thing to handle, blistering their
fingers' ends. If that were true, its larva
might also be nasty, and injurious to eat.
Suppose that sort of grub disagreed with
themP
The President said the proof of the pud-
ding was in the eating, and they could
ascertain the qualities of the new grub only
by trying it. For that purpose he would
recommend the formation of a Tasting
Committee, composed of experienced Rooks,
who would proceed with their habitual

Good and gallant GORDON PASHA writes from
Darfour to say, that though he has put down the
importation into Egypt of great caravans of slaves
with shebas * round their necks, he can't prevent
their importation in driblets of four and five. No
wonder, while there is a brisk demand in the
KHEDIVE's dominions for the imported article, that
there should be a steady supply from Darfour and
Kordofan. If the KHEDIVE really wishes, in deed
as well as word, to stop slave-hunting in Dar-
four, he has only to stop slave-owning in Egypt.
Can he-and, if he can, will he? These are the
two questions. There is little good in GORDON
spending his life to stop the main channel of this
foul stream, while its tributaries are allowed to
dribble their “fours and fives" into the recep-
tacles of the Egyptian slave - dealers, and the

His FELLOW-FEELING.
Me. Pongo was much interested at being told by an elderly Lady
that she had a Nephew in the Navy who was “a regular young
monkey. Being of a serious turn, Mr. Pongo at once consulted
his Chaplain-in-ordinary as to the propriety of instituting a series
of missions to the Young Monkeys in the Navy, commencing with
the Powder Monkeys.
HIS LIBERAL VIEWS.
MR. Pongo is much annoyed that the shilling paid for admission
to the Aquarium does not permit the visitor to make a call on him
without paying an extra fee of one or two shillings.
Old, BUNKUM BARNUM was quite right," says Me, PONGO,
emphatically. “This Exhibition ought to be thrown open for one
shilling. The shilling should comprehend all the amusements in
the place, and there should be no extra charges (except for a few
reserved seats), not even for programmes. This would make the
Aquarium, if the entertainment were first-class, the most popular
resort, whether for winter or summer, in the Metropolis."
Mr. Pongo is right. Now anything particularly worth seeing
within the Aquarium involves extra payment. This repels ordinary
pleasure-seekers; and boys home for the holidays (the great patrons
of this style of amusement) would rather visit the Zoological or Poly-
technic (specially this latter place, where the one shilling covers a
multitude of entertainments), than waste their limited capital on
the "extras" of the Aquarium. The charge to see MR. Pongo
"privately” is three shiliings!! MR. Pongo protests. MR. PONGO
says he will accept any invitation to dinner, but this style of
interviewing him at three shillings a head, is too much for every-
body. Again Mr. Pongo is right.
To the Londesborough Collection the admission is conditional on
purchasing a Catalogue for sixpence!! In fact, a visit to the

AMONG THE ROSES.
IN BULGARI.
“Owing to the devastating war in Bulgaria, total ruin and annihilation
have overtaken the rose-crop in the valley of Kazanlik, and the neigh-
bouring districts. . . . . All these places are devoted to this peculiar and
beautiful husbandry; the roses are grown by the field-full." -Our Own
Correspondent.
FAIR Flora stood upon the trampled ridge
Where erst her myriad roses wooed the eye,
Now reddened with a deeper dye-
The ghastly crimson of ensanguined feet
Which flying beat
In headlong haste across War's brazen bridge.
She stood, pale horror on her tender lips,
Her bright eyes dim and dark with pain's eclipse,
While the smoke smouldered westward on the wind
That bare Bellona's hoarse, far-echoing shout
Harsh on the ears of startled humankind.
Where'er she gazed, the wreck of hideous rout
Blotted her ancient pleasaunces. The earth,
Of old heaped high with sweet rose-petals, now
Was piled with mangled dead. From Flora's brow
Had fled the winning smile of summer mirth,
As, lifting eyes of horror to invoke
Help out of Heaven, the sad Flower-goddess spoke :
“How serve a race that stains my loveliest gift
With fierce Bellona's blood-dye? Here indeed
The ministries of Beauty and of Thrift
Were late united. But War's harpies heed
Nor labour's gain nor loveliness's dower.
Alas! my well-loved flower!
Broken thy charm, thine augury belied,
Before the ruthless storm of hate and pride.
Crescent or Cross, methinks, had fitlier wreathed
Its ensign with the blooms that lately breathed
A sweeter incense than the Churches know
O'er all these ravaged homesteads night and day,
And made these fields with brighter blossoms gay
Than deck the altars where great organs blow
Praise to the God of Peace.
Your fruitless flutings cease,
Ye pipes with mouths of gold! What music now,
Save War's shrill trump and hollow drum ?
All instruments but these be dumb,
Whilst Christian hate with Moslem fury closes
In murderous conflict 'midst my trampled roses.
And which the most accurséd ? Furious man
Has made a Golgotha of Gulistan,
Till fiends among my roses might laugh loud,
Taking my wreaths of red and white to shroud
War's hideous horrors and Hate's helpless prey.
And yet but yesterday
They made the land like Beulah with their blooms,
And not a purer, sweeter air perfumes
The Vale of Cashmere than late breathed among
These squares of fragrant husbandry, now flung
A prey to battle's never-satiate maw.
What wounds were those you saw,
Ye blue skies, and bright waters, and pure blossoms,
In men's hearts, children's limbs, and women's bosoms?
No more! I must away.
From where Bellona shares with Belial sway!
He holds a girl's fair tress in bloody hands;
Her mailéd foot on a crushed rose, she stands.
With that foul pair sad Flora may not cope,
But flies, in far-off hope,
When this dread Carnival of Carnage closes,
Once more to dwell with Peace among the Roses."
Couched at their Sage's feet
A troop of English maidens clustered, sweet
As their own roses, and as gay
As the light dancing in the leaves' glad play.
With them mild age and manly youth together
Basked in the light of home and harvest weather,
Until I sighed, and said-
"Yon eastward skies
Look clear, my maidens, as your orbs of blue;
But cover that which if those orbs but knew
By startled onlook, it would something dim
Their frolic sparkling. Boys, your length of limb,
Stretched lazily, would leap at the black work
Among the Roses, yonder, where the Turk
Redhanded grapples his redhanded foe.
Well that these balmy breezes do not blow
Echoes from those far Rose-plots to our own!
For Childhood's shriek and outraged Woman's groan
Would mar our Summer music. Yet, perchance,
Some thought of poor Bulgaria may enhance
Our stolid, silent British thankfulness
For long immunity from battle's stress,
For peace, and pleasant hours, and happy love
Amidst our English Roses here ; may move
Unpartisan Compassion to its task
Of even-handed helping. Here we bask
In sunny safety; there the smoke of war
Sweeps o'er the bloody track of battle's car,
Whose ruthless course is over homes and hearts.
Here, as the breeze yon leafy screen disparts,
Sweet pink-flushed petals, shaken from the bough,
Fall on the close-coiled tress that crowns your brow,
My fair-haired beauty, like a soft caress
From lips I need not name; but there,
Where through wrecked Rose-fields woman-slaughterers press,
The severed blossoms fall on bosoms bare,
Leaving a stain of redness not their own.
Poor Flora, lately flown
From that so desecrated Paradise,
Looks in on us, methinks, with mournful eyes,
Pleading with her more favoured children here,
Safe screened from lust's assault and battle's fear,
For pity and for help. Eternal shame
If party war-cries, in whatever name,
Deafen our ears to that appeal!
Prove we that no one-sided clamour closes
Our hearts to the large kindness which can feel
For sufferers of whatever race and creed,
That we can spare them help and pitying heed
From our blest homes of peace among the Roses."

IN BRITAIN.
I sat among the Roses. Row on row
Their blossoms clustered, in the golden glow
Of English August, round a garden nook
Whence, in the midday hush, glad eyes might look
O'er sweeping slopes of corn-land, stretching far
To where in the bright east the azure bar
Of circling ocean gleamed against the sky,
A silent witness of security.

I GLADLY accepted my Cousin's kind invitation to join his Grouse-

It is now one o'clock, and I feel nearly dead with
fatigue. I feel it was cruel to send me on a beat by
myself, like a policeman. I sit down to eat my lonely
lunch. I am told that this is not in accordance with the
precedent set by LORD ROCKET. “His Lordship never
sat down once ; nobbut ate a bun as he walked along."
Hang LORD ROCKET! I hate him !
After luncheon-which I haven't in the least enjoyed,
thanks to LORD ROCKET-Keeper says, “We should by
rights take that little strip back.”
"By all means," I reply; but that little strip back
means a belt of enormously rough heather, right over
the top of the hill we have just descended. I toil back
up the steep slope and stumble through the cruel bushes
mechanically, hopelessly. Keeper says, “There should
be some birds on the top, but there's no telling." Of
course there's no telling; and of course there are no
birds, not for me.
All this time I have been nearly roasted by the sun,
when suddenly it sets in to rain. It's a cold, drizzling,
wetting rain. I ask Keeper whether he thinks it will
be a wet afternoon. He replies, that it's “only heat.”
On the contrary, I find it decidedly cold.
The ling soon gets as slippery as sea-weed, but Keeper
doesn't suggest returning home; and as I know dinner
was ordered at eight, I shouldn't like to sneak home, in
an unsportsmanlike style, at five. So I plod on.
The rain (or heat) quite benumbs my hands. I sup-
pose I enjoy this very much; for, after all, it is sport.
I wonder what bags the rest of the party are making ? I
have only got two brace, though it's wonderful how
many birds Keeper declares I've killed, which fly away
notwithstanding. I must have killed quite ten brace;
and I shall count them, if any one asks what I've killed.
All of a sudden Dog, in ranging, frightens a bird
away without pointing it. Keeper's wrath is extreme.
He belabours wretched Dog with his ramrod, which is
also his walking-stick. He calls him a monkey-faced
brat, and the poor animal's whines might be heard all
the country round. I wonder he doesn't bite. I should
think he would bite me if I beat him like that. The
Bag-carrier watches the castigation soberly and silently.

“RELIGIOUS MANIA.-Two young girls in a fit of
religious enthusiasm have drowned themselves in the
Holy Well at Marpingen, in Rhenish Prussia. The
miraculous power of the 'well—a recent Ultramontane
discovery-gave rise a short time ago to painful dis-
closures, which necessitated the interference of the
police."
So that whether or no the well at Marpingen has
the power of curing, it certainly has that of kill-
ing. Like all wells which are deep enough, it
occasionally drowns people--and no wonder. If
it had only refused to drown those religious
enthusiasts, the two young girls who jumped

DRY GRAZING GROUND.
ACCORDING to the Meat and Provision Trades'
Review, CONSUL PERCEVAL, at Port Said, invited
to report on the cattle that could be supplied to
England from his distriet, returned LORD DERBY
the following answer :-
“My Lord,— With reference to the Foreign Office Cir-
cular of the 19th ult., I have the honour to inform your
Lordship that, the whole of my district being desert,
there are no sheep or cattle thereon.”
What was the Foreign Office thinking of to
request information respecting the amount of
animal food obtainable from the desert about Port
Said ? Anyone must have known it would supply
nothing, in the beef or mutton way, except in the
form of the venerable pun, “The sand-wich you

sequence of never having been seen. BUDDERMER bites;
even he, the stoic, the grave, the bald, the wise, even
he becomes excited, and, but for the decencies of
society, he would rush from the table down to the Pond,
and set the Trimmer. The Pond certainly has a mar-
vellous attraction. If, one day, from that Pond should
arise a Nix (which does not mean a Nothing, but a sort
of German freshwater Mermaiden), who should captivate
a visitor, perhaps BUDDERMER the Bald, and descend
with him, fascinated, to the bottom of the Pond, never
to return, or to return only once, when there would be
such a row with Mrs. BUDDERMER (who would natu-

would either send him back posthaste to the Nix, or
keep him terrified on land until the Nix came to fetch

and celebrated in verse by the Poet. But this is

Then Mrs. BUDDERMER winds up this new movement
in the dinner cantata with,
“I hope it will be fine enough for us to go out after
dinner, and walk down to the Pond.”
And Miss BUDDERMER, who is shy and blushing and
jerky, and who hasn't spoken as yet, but who has been

HERE's to the Past! 'Tis safe to praise
The ghosts of vanished glories,
To laud the lights of other days,

To vaunt the men of earlier times,
The belles of other seasons,
The sweetness of forgotten rhymes,
The power of dead men's reasons.
Dead dames than ours were not more fair,
Nor buried heroes stronger.
But then they share this virtue rare -
They stop the way no longer.
It nothing costs to feign regret

And optimistically set
The Past against the Present.

Of hálf indignant sorrow,

And ominous to-morrow.

picture which I had been carrying under my arm. I
searched every hole and corner. I charged the Pig with
having taken it to his Uncle's (Song—“My Uncle's in the

it as one of his " pignora cara,” or “dear pledges ;' but

shrugs his shoulders, elevates his eyebrows, and gravely
strokes his beard, in the character of a Philosopher who,
like a Stylites on a pillar, could afford to look down
on these mundane absurdities and give them their
proper value..
Miss BUDDERMER becomes more and more nervous.
In trying to keep up an under-current of conversation,
so as to avoid the aristocratic whirlpool into which
everyone is being drawn, I ask her, “I suppose you've
been engaged every night during the season?” whereat
she blushes so deeply, that it quite pains me, and I feel
bound to explain that what I meant was, “ Have you
been out to parties every night?” To which she re-
plies, simperingly, “Yes." Then with her profile
towards me she regards me timidly out of one eye,
(this is a wonderful movement of hers, and suggests
à mixture of shyness and slyness), and with a little
nervous titter asks, " Are you fond of dancing ?” Then
she looks away from me as if she'd said something, oh
80 bold and so dreadful, that once more I am quite
pained, and I wait for her profile to come round to me
again in order to give this one-sided view of her my
reply. For a second she raises her glasses, looks at
everybody comprehensively, but wonderingly, as if as-
tonished to find them all still there since she last looked
for them, and then as if startled by my cough, by which
I had intended to attract her attention, she drops the
glasses as though she'd been shot (she is perpetually
acting the suddenly stricken deer), and the simpering
profile is again timidly listening to my reply, which,
as my lips for this especial conversational purpose only,
are for falsehood framed, is to the effect that I'm
very fond of dancing ; but it depends on my partner.”
Whereat she blushes so nervously, and looks so
abashed, that a casual observer would swear I had just
proposed to her. MILBURD, from the opposite side,
breaks off in the middle of the general conversation
about the Aristocracy to say to me, “Oh! you sly
dog! I'm looking at you!" which makes me blush
in my turn, and brings us (my partner and myself) into
the stream of conversation for safety.

BORN, APRIL 16, 1797.
DIED, SEPTEMBER 3, 1877.
“Madame, votre illustre mari a vécu !”- Words of M. Barthe, in
annruncing to Madame Thiers the death of her husband.
TURNED with the true French grace! and yet perchance
Bearing an import wider than he thought
Who so declared that strenuous fight outfought,
And THIERS a memory to mourning France.
The dead had lived indeed ; a varied life
Of toil and eager strife;
Had played the Student's and the Statesman's part
On the world's busiest stage. That death-stilled heart
Had beaten high to its last pulse with hope,
True patriot heat, and courage prompt to cope
With France's foes wherever found,
Without her borders or within their bound.
And now, when wisdom calm and temperate zeal
So well might serve the menaced Commonweal,
The patriot passes, and the sage is still ;
Mute as the midnight Sentinel slain upon the hill.
But he has lived; and such a life should leave .
A legacy of wisdom to his land;
Should bid her sheath above his tomb the brand
Of civil discord, and essay to weave,
Into one close-knit coil,
The chords long strained by party feud and broil.
A patriot to the core, he loved fair France
Before his best-loved theories. Every thought
Was still her power and glory to enhance;
For these he wrote and fought
Through all his fourscore years of strife and toil.
To wreathe her brow with bay, to free her soil
From alien feet, to set her proud and fair
Before the nations, was his constant care.
Monarchy loving much, he loved yet more
The realm, whoe'er its badge of headship wore;
And, waiving self, was willing to abide
That rule which Frenchmen would the least divide.
Will Frenchmen learn at their lost leader's grave
The lesson of his life,
Whose watchful wisdom oft availed to save
The State from wreck in days with dangers rife ?
That were the truest tribute to his glory
Who “freed the territory."
Howe'er that be, no longer now he dwells
Amidst his books, his flowers, and his gazelles ;
No more that long familiar face and form
Shall draw the general glance ; no more his name
Shall sound as Safety's watch word in the storm ;
No more that keen clear voice shall tumult tame.
THIERS has lived! Lives he indeed no more ?
Nay, Frenchmen, let true patriot counsels prove
That in the Nation's memory and its love
“ Petit Bonhomme vit encore !”

In order to facilitate promotion in the Army, the preference in
selecting for commissions will, in future, be given to gentlemen of

know that our country is expensive, but really there is no occasion
to set the fact to music.

A Young Poet has long been in love with a beautiful girl. The
beautiful girl has smiled upon his suit. All is settled; the day is
fixed, and the ring is purchased. At the last moment the young
Poet discovers that a rival has been paying his addresses to the lady
of his heart, and that those addresses have not been regarded with
sufficient disfavour by his soul's idol. Instead of writing a long and
bitter letter full of taunts and reproaches, he sends the following
telegram, which reveals his knowledge, frees his bride, and hints at
suicide: -

In a moment of madness a number of Voters have elected a most

regaining their senses, they deeply regret their folly, and desire to

writing a long defence of his conduct, he telegraphs as follows:-

A body of Philanthropists are getting up a fund for some bene-

long letter full of excuses, telegraphs as follows:

Two Theologians have had a long and courteous correspondence

the views he avows on account of some slight defect in his mental

to a letter from the Mayor of Plymouth,
he says:
"It should never be forgotten that the position
assumed by sucb men is in reality based on the
exaggeration of the Protestant principle of private
judgment."
They will submit neither to Rome nor Can-
terbury. Each has hitherto been his own
Pope and his own Archbishop. However,
according to the Whitehall Review, a oon-
siderable number of them, clergy and laity,
are now organising a Church of their own;
an opposition Church of England, under the
denomination of “The Order of the Cor-
porate Reunion.” These are consistent
pseudo - Papistical Protestants. Nobody
can complain of seceders for conscience'
sake. If Ritualists will only get out of the
National Church into a Church of their own,
they will be entitled to play at Roman
Catholics as much as they please, and no-
| body will have any more right to blame or
ridicule them than anybody has to censure
or make fun of the Irvingites or the San-
demaniang. Do the laymen of the “Order
of the Corporate Reunion” include any
members of the lower classes P If so,
they might get up amongst them, as an
invitation to Ritualists in general, the cry
of “Flare up and join the Order !"

JUST THI8—THEY'RE THRYIN' TO GET US AS CHAPE AS THEY CAN-AND THEY

WAR's horror at its worst, the seeds of change
Darkly at work for Nations, Churches, Kings,
What is there in an old man's death so strange
To give it rank among eventful things ?
Nor King is he, nor President, nor Pope;
He holds nor sword of strength, nor keys of power ;
Hangs on his life nor world-wide fear nor hope ;
If he was e'er “The Man," long past his Hour.
Yet but one Statesman's exit, and no King's,
Could give such theme for thought, and tongue, and
pen,
As this small eighty-years-old bourgeois's brings
The lightest hearts, and quickest wits, of men.
France, save the fraction that Alings filth for flowers,
Utters one voice of sorrowing regret
O'er him who gave her his long manhood's powers,
Whom Death, at eighty, found her soldier yet,
Unbowed beneath the burden of fourscore,
Donning his armour for the self-same fight
In which, a stripling, erst the flag he bore
Of Might enthroned in Power, with Law-based Right.
What wonder France should sorrow so for him
Who scorned what she scorns, held what she holds
dear;
Whose quick sense saw no truth, while it was dim,
Content to rest in half-truth, while 'twas clear.
The sharpest-shaping, keenest-biting wit
That kept alive the memory of VOLTAIRE;
Most French of Frenchmen, apt with phrase to fit
The unspoke sentiment that filled the air,
So giving it the concrete life that moulds
A Party's purpose, People's mood, to Act;
Finding, at need, the wanted word that holds
A Nation's fancy, till it turns to fact.
Against such gifts, what was it that his pen
At times postponed harsh truth to happy phrase ?
If, when he ministered as chief of men,
The Statesman grasped at times the meaner praise
Of winning cleverly, than on the square ?
The Jury he appealed to were his peers;
His history was their legend, written fair;
His spice of false won for his truth their ears.!
Nor only France he glassed, in fleck and flaw;
From youth he was the soldier-sworn of Right
Set in the adamantine bounds of Law,
For that was first, would have been last, to fight.
And therefore France, once more upon the verge
Of that sad war 'tis still her fate to wage,
'Twixt Might with Power, Right with but Law to urge,
Took him for champion even in his age.
Prone as she is good service to forget,
And fickle in her favour, as they say,
Still in her heart she bore the man who set
Weakness aside, and cast old age away,
Posting the world to raise her up a friend;
Then, harder task, subdued his wrath aud shame,
His conquered country's interest to defe id,
And melt her conquerors to milder frame.'
Who, when concession's utmost boon was wrung,
Despaired not of his country, stricken low,
Beaten and bleeding, but her nerves re-strung
In tune to his, weak wailing to forego,
With hardness to endure, War's debt to pay,
And Peace's work with' heart and hope set to,
To earn the ransom she had wealth to pay,
And envy of her conquerors thereto.
For this she mourns him-lays upon his bier,
Tribute of common grief, the Civic Crown;
And holds this little Bourgeois, henceforth, dear,
Among her Great Ones to the dead gone down.
CADS IN KENT.
THERE is generally something in what the divine WILLIAMS says, or makes
his characters say. In the Second Part of Henry the Fourth a personage
remarks that,
" Kent, in the Commentaries CÆSAR writ,
Is term'd the civill'st place of all this isle."
The suggestion that Kent might still retain the character given it by CÆSAR,
follows. Perhaps the Kentish people still excel in civility, as a rule. But the
reception given to passengers arriving from Boulogne appears to prove the folk,
or a portion of the folk, of Folkestone an exception. Can it be that they are
distinguished by their deficiency in this respect from the inhabitants of Dover?
It is truly said that civility costs nothing. The converse also is true, and it is
possible to lose by rudeness. Unfortunately, too, it is possible to make others
lose. Hotel-keepers and tradesmen are interested in a question which concerns
travellers, and may have a material interest in determining choice of route. Is
it impossible that a public meeting could be held at Folkestone to take measures
for deterring the Cads of that town from brutal behaviour ?

Oh, my gracious, Mr. Punch, do just look at this !
“Bishop O'CONNELL, of California, has announced to his congregations that, according

Goodness! Only fancy being wicked if one waltzes! How thankful
one should be that one is not a Roman Catholic, at least if one is fond of
"participating in round dances !” If such instructions come to London, as
well as California, I guess the Cardinal will not make many converts here next

To sum her gift, though some who use her name
May mouth too loudly, cloaking 'neath her cause
Mere party heat and fussy self-applause.
But she stands blameless-almoner of all.
Before the claims which on her coffers fall,
The purse of Fortunatus well might fail,
The touch of Midas prove of small avail.
Here is her tribute to a giant need,
Which makes all lesser claims loom small, indeed,

Of imminent Famine! 'Tis a task to awe

An arduous enterprise, that soars above
Charity's stretch, for alien needs may share
Her generous doles—but this is my affair!
A true Imperial interest, as I hold,
That well may tithe my Treasury's garnered gold.
The net of Charity, though broadly cast,
Misses the millions, and the draught at last
Is slight and insufficient; great and small
Should share this task-the duty lies on all.

out."
“And did he?" I ask, vaguely, for I am not
certain whether my inquiry applies to Boss GREEN,
GEORGE Biggs, or LORD SHORTLAND, or perhaps
somebody else whose name I've missed.
“ Did he?” exclaims CALTOP, as if atterly
astonished at the ignorance displayed by my ques-
tion. “I should rather say he did. They wanted
to stop him. One Bobby tried it on, but GEORGEY
---our JARGY, as we call him-tipped the peeler a

little NORRIS, who was out for the first time, in
a horrid state about his four greys. GEORGEY did
the trick. They said he hedged the bet, but any-
how he copped Boss GREEN's fifty quid."
“Rather rough on the Boss," I venture, with a
mild attempt at suiting my conversation to my
company..
"Oh, the Boss !” exclaims CALTOP, "he's a
regular mug."
Everyone appears amused, and no one likes to
ask what on earth CALTOP means. At this moment
the Poet remarks that there's a fine moon, and
opens the window to look at it. Mrs. BUDDERMER
asks her husband to give her the slightest drop of
sherry-and-water. This causes the Butler to be
summoned to fetch the sherry; when he appears,
POGMORE complains of the cold in consequence of
the window having been opened. MILBURD agrees
that it is cold, and CALTOP remembers that he 'll
probably have a chilly walk home. BUDDERMER
casually mentions“ hot grog” as the best preven-
tive. BOODELS, as host, asks if CALTOP would
like some hot grog before he starts, as, if so, the
Butler can make a first-rate brew. CALTOP at
first refuses, then alters his mind, and saying,
“I really must go immediately after that," he,
to use his own expression, "goes for that grog."
MILBURD admits that he, too, is “ Nuts on grog."
I notice that whenever CALTOP, or MILBURD, likes
anything, they are either “nuts on it," or it is
“real jam” to them. Odd! POGMORE observes
"That he doesn't mind if he does just take a
drop of hot grog.” Whereupon BUDDERMER be-
gins to think that it wouldn't do him any harm,
which evokes a look of surprise, and a warning,
from his Wife, who, however, consents, after a
very, brief argument, to assist him with a mere

But, as to clearness, well, upon my life,

Upon your honour. I've no wish to doubt it;
Though, as a soldier, it were perhaps as well

THE Special Correspondent of the Times at Rome, with reference
to the POPE, and to a contingency only too possible at any moment,
mentions that an oath is always administered to a new Pontiff, that
“ he shall maintain intact and inviolate the dominions of the Holy
See such as he received them from his predecessors.” Unless the
Italian Government, in the meanwhile, shall have repented of their
“sacrilege" of 1870, and re-established the Temporal Power, they
can only hope that the next Successor of St. Peter will not hesitate
to take that oath, should it be tendered him. The dominions of the
Holy See being now purely spiritual, he, if he swears to maintain
them such as he has received them, will simply bind himself to
maintain them and them alone. Will the Cardinals ask him to
swear that? Then the discovery of a modus vivendi approaches;
and there is hope that Church and State in Italy may kiss and be
friends.

A CONJUGAL UNION WORKHOUSE.
ADDRESSING the Social Science Congress assembled at
Aberdeen, the Earl of that ilk suggested the possibility
of a distinction between poor and poor; “the idle and
those who are scarcely deserving of pity" on the one
hand, and, on the other, “the unfortunate who lapse
into poverty through no fault of their own," but, being
liable to the same punishment as the improvident pau-
pers, “are thus repelled, and the public sense is occa-
sionally shocked by the record of deaths incurred to
avoid the workhouse." Not content with proposing a
quite too awful breach of Political Economy, the noble
Lord went on to say :-
"As a single illustration of my meaning, I may mention the
enforced separation of married partners. Such a requirement,
for instance, though generally necessary for the maintenance of
order and discipline, might surely be dispensed with, at all
events, in the case of the aged and infirm. To sum up the
matter in a word, while for the many the workhouse properly
partakes of the character of a reformatory, there are those for
whom it is rather to be regarded as an asylum.”
If " when Poverty comes in at the door, Love flies
out at the window," it might be thought that the prin-
ciple of the Poor Law would be best consulted, not by
separating pauper couples, but by compelling them,
provident or improvident, to live together. But perhaps
conjugal affection can in some cases survive on molasses
and skilligolee. Lord ABERDEEN seems to believe in
“ John Anderson, my Jo,” as a song of married life
compatible with indigence or even pauperism. But his
idea of allowing Mr. and Mrs. Anderson on any account
to enjoy one another's society in a Workhouse, is one
that of course nobody connected with any such Institu-
tion could entertain for a moment, except possibly the
Chaplain.

the Sentries wore their Court Uniforms. The hospitals
had been removed three miles to the rear, so that no
ungainly sight should meet the view of the fair excur-
sionists. Here and there little puffs of smoke in the
distance told that a battle was going on somewhere.
Fortunately the wind was in the right direction, and
carried away the unsavoury vapour, so that there was no
unpleasant odour of gunpowder in the Imperial marquee.
On the contrary, the EMPEROR's tent had been pro-
fusely sprinkled with eau-de-Cologne and other refresh-
ing scents. For months the Engineers had been engaged
upon the construction of a road laid down with wood-
pavement, so that the springs of the many graceful
carriages carrying the fair guests to the Head-Quarters
were not put to a test of unusual severity.
At noon the camp was thronged with Ladies wearing
the most charming toilettes, which added to the glories
of the scene. As usual, all the officers were a mass of
gold and silver, bright helmets, and flowing plumes.
The day commenced with a pic-nic in a most picturesque
village which had been reduced to ruins by the bom-
bardment of last month. A distinguished Stage-Manager
from the Capital had made the most of his materials, and
had rendered the little hamlet a perfect bower of bliss.
Nothing could have been prettier than the quaintly-
shaped walls decorated with artificial flowers, and the
dismantled pump was simply charming in its new cha-
racter of a crystal fountain. The al fresco meal consisted
of all the delicacies of the season, and the gorgeously.
liveried flunkeys had no sinecure in their duty of opening
bottles of sparkling champagne. At the end of the feast
a most amusing incident occurred. At a signal from a
General, a bombardment took place of tiny shells made
of mother-of-pearl. Each Lady received one of these
" projectiles," and found, to her relief, that it contained
nothing more terrible than bon-bons. Playful shrieks
and silvery ripples of laughter brought the pic-nic to
a suitable conclusion. Later in the day the guests
strolled to an observatory, where powerful telescopes
had been planted. Through these glasses the move-
ments of the troops in the far distance could be dis-
tinctly seen. A message was conveyed through the field
telegraph to the officer commanding the troops at the
front requesting him to have the kindness to order an
attack to be made upon one of the enemy's forts for the
amusement of the company. The desire met with a
ready compliance, and for several minutes the guests

and switching the flowers as he goes, walks
leisurely towards the Pond. Now nothing
irritates BOODELS so much as anyone walk-
ing off with this particular cane. I foresee
a row when I catch sight, from the Library
window, of MILBURD's proceedings.
I see the three at the Pond. All gloomy,
as if meditating suicide. The two Ladies,
wrapped up, are strolling on the paths.
Presently they join the gentlemen at the
Pond. Evidently a conspiracy.
Another moment, and I hear the Dog
with the bells scampering about and bark-
ing; also another dog. From which I
infer that BOODELS is in the hall getting
his hat, previous to going out “for a turn."
There is a great rattling of the umbrella-
stand, and a shaking of all sorts of things
in the Hall.
Then the Butler's voice, “I don't know
where it is, Sir."
Then BOODELS', angrily demanding, “Who
cleans the Hall 'in the morning ? Then
the Butler calling the Maid. Cross-ex-
amination of the Maid. She's certain
she didn't move it. It was here this
morning, she's sure. The Butler, too,
will swear to having seen it yesterday.
BOODELS more and more angry. He bursts
into the Library:
"Have you taken it?” he asks, abruptly,
“What?"
“My ebony cane with the lizard top."
No, 'I haven't. But, I suggest, rather
maliciously (because why should he always
suspect me of taking everything ?-as, a
fact, he always does) “Perhaps one of the
others has got it.”
He won't go out without it; not even
into the kitchen-garden. It has become a
necessity. The Butler will go and ask if
anyone's got it, and, if they have, he will
bring it back. From the window we see
the Butler on his way to the Pond. We
witness his reception by the assembled
conspirators. It is all pantomime action
to us. It does not inspire confidence in the
result. All that BOODELS has said, since
sending the Butler, is, as he stood at the
window eyeing the scene, “I hate practical
jokes." This is meant as a warning to me,
not to take one of his sticks.
The Butler returns empty-handed. With
a half-grin he says (more to me than to his
master), “Mr. MILBURD says, Sir, as he's
very sorry, but in trying to catch the Eel,
the stick tumbled into the Pond.”
“Nonsense!” exclaims BOODELS, ex-
ploding.

Whilst we send doctors to minister to the miseries

of encouragement to persevere in their profession, that
the British Medical Benevolent Fund wanted support.

what I am prepared to do. And I will go
further. In the event of the £500,000

A. Whenever there is an interesting trial for murder
on the list.
Q. What do you mean by an interesting trial for
murder?
A. A case in which either the facts or the people are
interesting.
Q. Will you please make your meaning a little plainer?
A. I call the fact interesting if there is any doubt
about the manner of the doing of the murder-poisoning
cases, for instance, come under this category. The per-
sons are interesting when they are people of better birth
and education than the ordinary assassin.
Q. Has the sex of the prisoners anything to do with it?
Ă. Oh yes, a great deal. A female prisoner charged
with murder is far more interesting than a male mur-
derer, especially if she is quite young and cries a good
deal in the dock.
Q. But how can you tell that she is crying ?
A. By looking at her through an opera-glass.
Q. But is not a trial of this class after a while rather
wearying?
A. No, for it must be remembered that the cushioned
seats on the Bench are very comfortable. Besides, if
the evidence becomes monotonous, the male visitors
lounging near you are always available for flirtation.
Q. But do you not miss your lunch?
A. Of course not. If you take a flask of sherry and
some sandwiches with you, you should be prepared for
all emergencies.
Q. What do you consider the most exciting part of
the day's proceedings in an interesting trial for murder ?
A. When the jury return their yerdict.
Q. And the most amusing ?
A. Of course when the judge puts on his funny little
black cap, and passes sentence of death.
Q. Doubtless you are aware that the Ladies of ancient
Rome used to take a great deal of pleasure in witnessing
gladiatorial contests, which were invariably attended
with bloodshed. Now what do you consider those
gladiatorial contests to have been ?
A. Tame in the extreme when compared with a trial
for murder at the Old Bailey. I suppose (had I existed
in those times) I should have gone to the former, but I
am pleased I live in the nineteenth century, for I cer-
tainly prefer the latter. The struggle for life is vul-
garised by a too open exposure of the death-wounds.

THE SCIOLIST'S TRIUMPH.
A SCIOLIST, at evening's close,
Sat snug with spectacles on nose,
And read his penny paper,
He dwelt in a suburban spot,
Of lore he had amassed a lot,
And burnt much midnight taper ;
At least so the tradition ran
Concerning this amazing man.
His friends-and he had not few-
Opined he knew “a thing or two."
You 'll find, on due reflection,
Such modest numerals express
Omniscience, and nothing less,
When used in this connection.
Few rhymesters ever turned a verse on
So very well-informed a person.
He laid his penny paper down,
He knit his eyebrows in a frown,
(They were severe and shaggy),
He pished, poobed, pshawed, he rubbed
his chin,
He thrust his doubled digits in
His pockets big and baggy.
Cried he, at last, " This will not do!
The world is going all askew!
“Its Science!-Pooh! All fog and smoke!
Its Jurisprudence-a mere joke!
Its Law-the merest jumble !
These savants I must show new lights,
These rulers I must set to rights,
These big-wigs I must humble.
I'll put a stop to Error's capers
By simply writing to the papers."
Att ge who would drink,

And if you'd know why-
He wrote to all the penny prints,
Of October, I wot,
'Tis because when he's dry,
He sent them homilies, and hints,

from that information that dis-

Dissenters from the Church of
England, who have not yet gone

up a community of their own,

You object
To couleurs tendres ?
Edwin.
Nay, when I reflect
On early days, when every dainty hue
From drap de neige to serge of navy blue,
From fawn to pourpre foncé, now might mark
Save as dull interchange of light and dark ;
When all the world, as WHISTLER well might say,
Was a mere symphony in black and grey,
Why then I swear I do not envy HOMER,
And think the Golden Age a strange misnomer,
Fancy a Golden Age in which no fellow
Could tell dull leaden grey from bullion yellow!

This rose's crimson and that myrtle's green!

Or some sweet She-Symposium's eager chat
Over the last Le Follet.

About the teintes degradées of the day

He does not touch those most important questions.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE IN THE LIFE
OF A GOOD GIRL.
I PASSED adown the silent street,
All drenched with rain and driving sleet, -
I was alone.
There came from out a window-seat
A dreadful kind of plaintive bleat-
A dismal moan.
PARIS DURING THE ELECTIONS.
WHAT THEY DID Not Do.
THEY did not insult Generals through omnibus windows, à la VICTOR Hugo,
to the great alarm of their more peaceable fellow-travellers.
They did not set fire to the Élysée, and shoot the Marshal President as he
attempted to escape from the flames.
They did not overturn the Kiosks on the Boulevards, and use them for
the construction of barricades.
They did not seize the Grand Hôtel, and lower by force all the tariffs.
They did not surprise the scores of diners at the Splendide Hôtel table d'hôte,
and appropriate their much-prized meal to their own uses.
They did not shoot a single English "Mees," or insult a veritable " John-
bull.”
They did not treat the English Church as if it were merely a sight to be
gaped at, and walk about the sacred edifice, laughing and talking, during the
hours of divine service.
They did not kill any Foreigner for doing the same sort of thing at Notre
Dame and the Madeleine.
They did not shoot any High Church Parson in mistake for a Priest.
They did not pull down the Column in the Place Vendôme.
They did not stop the Diner de Paris and block up the Passage Jouffroy.
They did not seize Punch and the English newspapers on the score that they
were immoral.
They did not steal the cab-horses, nor cut the telegraph wires.
In fact they did nothing suggestive of a revival of the much-dreaded
Commune.
WHAT THEY DID Do.
They got up in the morning and went to Church.
They took (some of them) the early train to Chantilly.
They drove (others of them) in the Bois de Boulogne and Champs Elysées.
They walked under the trees and enjoyed the sunshine.
They recorded their votes in a perfectly regular manner.
They laughed and chatted, and were the essence of good-nature.
They (those of them being fathers of families) took their households to enjoy
the usual Sunday dinners at the favourite restaurants.
They (those of them being engaged) took their respective and prospective
brides to pleasant walks in the country.
They (those of them having no domestic ties) seated (themselves in their
customary cafés, and envied in an amiable sort of way the greater happiness of
their more fortunate fellow countrymen.
They passed their day perfectly quietly, respectably, and happily.
They stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, waiting for and reading the
latest editions of the evening papers.
In fact, they behaved like a rational, peace-loving people, and utterly falsified
the sinister predictions of the quidnuncs of the English Press.

un canvi ranging on
It shocked my ears—there, by the Sea,
Where all so calm, so pure should be-
To hear these groans.
I paused, and listened anxiously;
A voice then cried (it seemed to me)
In mournful tones :
“Look out, my Love-look out once more !
Perhaps the rain has ceased to pour.
I long to gaze
But once upon that wave-washed shore :
We've never been outside the door
For five long days!
“For five long weary days we've sat
And heard the ceaseless pit-a-pat
Of dropping rain.
My nose is really worn quite flat,
With pressing, day by day, on that
Confounded pane!
“We've read these books just three times o'er,
And can't get out to fetch some more.
I'm very loath
To send the girl. 0! what a bore !”
Just here the voice broke down, and swore
A Horrid Oath!
“WHERE IS THE PHILISTINE ?”
SIR, -Among the light literature provided by Mr. WILLING for passers-by,
and the scraps of pathos and bathos in the second column of the daily papers, I
have been thrilled by one earnest appeal for information as to the present
haunts of the Philistine. Wiseacres advise me not to trouble my head about
the matter, as they feel certain that this is only a way of heralding the virtues
of a new sauce, or sherry, or safe-maker. But I differ with them, and recognise
in the brief sentence the lamentation of one friend for another. Therefore,
being in a position to furnish full details as to the present whereabouts of this
missing link between the snob and the cad, I hasten to offer them through you
to his sorrowing friend, merely pausing to remark that, if I had lost sight of
him, and found a region where he was not, I should have exercised the virtue
of resignation, and taken no active steps for his recovery.
I saw him only this morning travelling by the Underground Railway, with
his dusty boots on the opposite cushion-in close proximity to a Lady's white
dress. Last night he was in the pit of one of the theatres, wearing a very tall
hat, which prevented those behind him from seeing the stage, save when the
drop-scene was fitfully visible as he nodded his head in time to the orchestra.
Meanwhile those in front lost the best points in the piece owing to the loud tones
in which he was disclosing his most private and confidential affairs to a friend.
He is to be met with every day in High Holborn, staring in Ladies' faces, and
whispering endearments as he passes them. On Sunday he goes to St. Paul's,
and generally sits in an easy attitude-with his back to the choir, so that he
may best stare out of countenance any young Lady who finds favour in his eyes.
He wears a very large snake ring, but modestly veils its glories under yellow
gloves—which might be cleaner. He reads the Daily Telegraph, and regards
its leaders as magnificent specimens of English. He pores over the second-hand
gossip of penny-a-liners in the omniscient weekly papers, and quotes it on the
authority of "a friend of mine."
But I shall “ no longer seek his errors to disclose," and in return for all this
information will merely beg one scrap of satisfaction on this subject of the
Philistine, “Where is he not?” Who can tell your
INQUIRER ?

TE
BULUATION
Adown that rain-swept street I tore,
And, shudd'ring, left that heathen's door-
He was so wroth!

I'll never, never visit more-

THE FASHION FOR FRANCE.
LA BELLE FRANCE loquitur.
HA! they twit me with being a volatile dame,
As fickle in love as I'm changeful in fashion.
Bah! Their taste is too triste and their temper too tame
To invent a new mode or to feel a grand passion.
Ma foi ! here's a fit that is much to my mind;
That it suits me one surely may see at a glance.
They offer me others-exceedingly kind,
But this, after all, is the Fashion for France !
Many toilettes, 'tis true, I have tried in my time;
Here's one I have stuck to for several seasons.
Such constancy some may consider a crime,
But I don't mean to change it-for various reasons.
The red is too gaudy, the lily too pale,
A violet vesture I hate à outrance ;
All those robes are rococo, or tawdry, or stale,
This, à mon avis, is the Fashion for France!
Scarce so chic or coquette as some costumes, I own,
Yet I think that the whole is in excellent taste.
My Costumier swears, with a shrug and a groan,
It's too short in the skirts, or too loose in the waist;
That the tint is too voyant, the trimming too fine,
That the cap wholly fails my best charms to enhance;
Yet still to the cloth and the cut I incline,
And find, on the whole, 'tis the Fashion for France !
I am tired of much change. In this dress I'm at ease,
And I think it becoming, and likely to wear.
My Marchands des Modes may protest, if they please,
Chacun à son gout, and for theirs I don't care.
Would the meddlesome creatures but let me alone,
They'd my comfort consult and my fortunes advance.
To this trim tout ensemble accustomed I've grown,
And I feel quite convinced 'tis the Fashion for France !

in that large box ?
Second Passenger. Certainly. A box of surgical instruments. I
find them most useful after a collision.
First Passenger. A wise precaution. I am sorry to say that I
have been disappointed of my usual travelling companion.
Second Passenger. I presume you allude to your wife.
First Passenger. No; I mean my Doctor.
Second Passenger. Ah, to be sure. By the way, have you seen
this little work-Railway Athletics ; or, How to be Thrown out of a
First-Class Carriage in Thirty Different Ways without being Killed ?
First Passenger. An excellent idea. They are very attentive on
this line.
Second Passenger. Yes, they always devote half a dozen trucks to
the conveyance of hearses. So comforting to the survivors, don't
you know.
First Passenger. Very nice feeling, indeed.
Second Passenger. Oh yes, the Directors are most humane. They
only appoint men in the last stages of consumption to the posts of
engine-drivers, stokers, and guards.
First Passenger. I see ; so that a collision only anticipates
matters a little, poor fellows!
Second Passenger. Precisely. May I offer you a patent buffer?
You will find it very useful when our carriage is converted into a
telescope.
First Passenger. Thank you very much. You think we shall
have an accident to-day?
Second Passenger. I am afraid so; there has been no serious
smash since the day before yesterday. Will you kindly give me
my leaping-pole?
First Passenger. Here it is.

On his arrival the SHAH will not be received by the British Fleet.
When he arrives in London, Her MAJESTY may, let us hope, for
a wonder, be housed in Buckingham Palace.
The SHAH will, consequently, not be able to use the royal apart-
ments as saloons for the exhibition of the noble art of self-defence,
and to surround himself in the Palace of Her MAJESTY with acrobats,
and comic singers.
He will not be taken in state to Covent Garden Opera, surrounded
by an escort of Life Guards.
"He will not be invited to review the British Army at Windsor
Park.
He will not be encouraged to “promote" a Company, with a
capital consisting of that very unknown quantity-the vast mineral
and other resources of Persia.
He will not be cheered by the multitude as the peer of the
Emperors of Germany, Russia, and Austria.
He will not furnish the subject of numberless articles in the daily
press, nor will he be recognised as the successor to the prestige of
ALEXANDER THE GREAT.
He will not receive the homage of the LORD MAYOR and the free-
dom of the City in a gold box.
In fact, he will not be fêted as a powerful Sovereign, but will be
permitted to maintain his well-merited incognito, as a small and very
much out-at-elbows Eastern despot of highly disreputable character.

The conductor of the omnibus having now completed
the number of passengers, wished to move on. I for-
bade him, and continued to hurl maledictions at the man
in the General's uniform. When I had screamed (always
through the omnibus window) for about half an hour, I
was roughly seized by a Creature dressed in Blue.
“Leave me !" I shouted, and attempted to defend

REWAR
myself.
"Nonsense!” said the Creature in Blué. "We have
had enough of this. You must come along with me."
At this the other “insides” in the omnibus cheered.
Was I not right to refuse them the title of men? They
cheered, and urged the Creature in Blue to remove me
speedily. He seized me!
*“On what charge do you dare to arrest me?"
The Creature in Blue merely laughed and dragged me
out of the omnibus. The other “insides” (miserables !)
cheered again, declaring that I was a “bore," a “nui-
sance,”-I know not what!
"Do you know who I am ?" I cried, shaking my
umbrella.
"I don't know," returned the Creature in Blue, "and
I don't want to know. But I will teach you to insult a
gentleman when he is only performing bis duty."
"Do you allude to that thing in tinsel ?" I cried,
pointing to the man in the General's uniform.
“Of course I do,” returned the Creature in Blue.
"Why, I was only denouncing him," I replied, in an
explanatory tone, because I recognised Force. The Crea-
ture in Blue had got me by the scruff of the neck. The
Creature in Blue was consequently Force, and as Force I
recognised and respected him.
“You were using language calculated to cause a breach
of the peace," said the Creature in Blue, "and that is
punishable."
“And what are you going to do with me?"
" To lock you up."
And locked up I should have been had I not been
saved by Diplomacy. Diplomacy has many shapes. On
this occasion she was called (by the Creature in Blue)
"Two half-crowns.” But was not Diplomacy also a
bribe ? Yes, but a bribe is a wild sort of justice. It is
also better than being locked up in a police-cell.

THE Times reports the proposal of a hopeful expedient
with a view to the augmentation of
“MINERS' WAGES.- The Central Board of the Miners'
National Union, which numbers about 90,000 members, have
decided to commence, at an early date, a special conference for
the purpose of taking into consideration the great need of
putting into operation some plan whereby the over production
of coal can be checked."
By the “production" these clever fellows of course
mean the procuring of coal. There is too little fear that
too much coal will ever be produced underground. The
production of coal in British coalfields having ceased
long ago, over production of that is production over and
ended. Miners themselves might wish to encourage it if
they could, and not to check it. The over production of
coal they want to check is the supply, which they
imagine too plentiful. It does not, perhaps, strike them
that if they succeed in checking the production of coal,
they are very likely also to check its consumption, and
bring about a general economy of coal profitable neither
to coal-merchants, nor proprietors of coal-mines, nor
coal-miners. In thus retarding the exhaustion of British
coal-measures, they might be earning their country's
gratitude indeed, but it would be as a set-off against
their own lower wages.

To the pleasing announcement that Sir JOSEPH HOOKER
has returned, in excellent health, from his three months'
tour in the United States, the Atheneum adds the
observation that
"From the results of his travel may be expected further con-
tributions to our knowledge of the physiology of plants."
Yes; and especially from the experience he may be
supposed to have enjoyed at New York-a location so
celebrated for producing that very peculiar class of
Plants growing, like certain mysterious cryptogams of the

The Atheneum further says:-
" Sir J. HOOKER is, we believe, of opinion that the key to
the botany of the United States is to be found in Colorado.”
Of course, the Conservator of Kew Gardens must know
where to find the key of Botany. But Colorado is less
intimately associated in the public mind just now with
Botany than with a sister science. Between its Botany
and its Entomology, however, that very interesting State
seems likely to acquire exceptional scientific importance.

“EXEGI MONUMENTUM.”
One of the trio convicted a few days ago of conspiracy
to defraud the Artisans' Dwellings Company made a
very pathetic speech to the Court, in the course of which
he bore warm testimony to his own virtues, sacrifices,
and services to the Working-Man. Besides“ supplying
building plans to all the Crowned Heads of Europe," he
has (as the Old Bailey has now given us abundant testi-
mony) “done wonders at Clapham.” “The erection
of the Shaftesbury Park Buildings alone,” he tells us,
“is a monument to his memory, making him at once
“revered and respected."
Suppose, by way of tribute to this revered convict, the
Shaftesbury Estate were re-christened as “Great Swin-
dlehurst”How would the tenants like it? This monu-
ment to the promoter of the Artisans' Dwelling Company,
if not quite ære perennius (the houses on the Estate not
being remarkable for solid construction), might at least
be something of a set-off against eighteen months of
prison reflection, prison discipline, and prison labour.
If there be truth in the Latin adage, Nemo repente fuit
turpissimus, we may suppose that this benefactor of the
Working Man rose to his proud eminence by degrees

Adding Insult to Injury.
SOME of Punch's readers may remember the press-
gang's way of dealing in GOLDSMITH's story of the one-
legged Tar. “They first knocked me down,” says the
light-hearted sailor, "and then bade me stand.” So it
is with the Chelsea Vestry. They first crack the crown
of the Misses CLARKES' cellar with their fifteen-ton
steam-roller, and then call on them to pay for mending it.
No, thank you, my dear Bumble. 'Tis excellent to have
a steam-roller to break the new-laid granite of your roads

the parishioners whose vaults it cracks to pay the cost
of repairs. “Who breaks, pays," should be the motto,

voice, in the hedge, humming the musio already described, fell on
his ear, and NEGUS BABCROW trembled for the brave girl who had
risked her life for his.
A minute after, she was lost to view.
What was to happen next?
CHAPTER X.-The Rally, the Roughs, and the Tumble.
DAN BEERTE stood, grimly smiling, in the shadow, with a long,
thick, pliant stout stick-a "wakkur," as they call it here-in his
band!
There was a malicious sense of humour in his smile, that boded
no one any good.
Of his two companions in the plot, the one was humming in the
hedge, the other lay with his face downwards in the lane in front of
the gate through which they knew the Young Engineer must pass
on his road homewards.
DAN BEERIE had given his directions carefully. He had told
them, “ When yo zee ar mon fall ow'r ther pal lyin' down i' t' road,
joomp oop, lads, an' bang 'im ow'r t' nut wi' yer sticks.”
Then, walking backwards to his place of concealment, he added,
“Oil teech thar varmint to mark me carry a fan i' t' mine." He
paused; for a familiar footstep in the road fell on his ear.
“Bar 'OOMFREY Davy, it's hersen!” he exclaimed, with a fearful
oath. “Oil stop the peeghedded wench, or she'll spoil orl.” And
he walked towards the gate, intending to pass into the lane, and
confront his daughter. He was on the very track that NEGUs, but
for the warning, would himself have taken.
“Oil gi 'er zumthin',” he muttered furiously as he reached the
gate—“Oil gi 'er a gewd "
But the sentence was never finished.
There was a violent humming of the “rum-tum-tiddy" music
faster and more furiously than ever, as DAN BEERIE stumbled
heavily over his partner's prostrate form, and fell, head-foremost,
at full length on the road. Before he could explain the fatal mis-
take, his two friends were on to him violently with their sticks,
and were beating him to a jelly, when EMMA suddenly stood before

them..
At this instant the light shone through the neighbouring Limes.

LORD MAYOR is descended
from an old Venetian
family which established
itself in the neighbour-
hood of the Guildhall
after the revocation of
GE
the Edict of Nantes by
the Emperor ALEXANDER
THE GREAT. Another
branch of the same family
has, long flourished at
Gogmagogues in Brittany.
In former times, before
the traffic was forbidden, his Lordship's ancestors were engaged in the exportation of Liverymen to the South Coast of Africa, but his more
immediate progenitors were connected with the trade and manufactures of this country as Loriners to all the Reigning Sovereigns of
Europe. He himself came up to London in early life from the Chiltern Hundreds, with a Canary bird in a cage, protected from
the sun by a silk handkerchief, but slenderly provided with pocket-money, and speedily amassed a large fortune by means of honourable
and extensive mercantile transactions with the Island of Ascension.
The LORD MAYOR's official salary is £50,000 a year, derived from a tax which the Corporation of London are empowered by an Act of
Parliament, passed in the reign of King ALFRED, to levy upon every box of cigar-lights sold within the City boundaries. His retinue
consists of a Wig-bearer, a Standard-bearer, a Chaplain (generally the Junior Bishop), a City Jester-the celebrated JOSEPH MILLER
was the first-a Taster, a Toastmaster, and á Remembrancer, who attends his Lordship every morning, while he is dressing, to remind
him of the duties of the day, and is paid by the hour.
The LORD MAYOR wears a fur cap on all occasions of ceremony and festivity, and enjoys the privilege of remaining uncovered in
the presence of Royalty. His official residence in winter is Temple Bar, which is adorned with exquisite statues, executed by WREN
and BIRD, of some of his most illustrious predecessors; and in summer he holds his Court on the Thames in a State-barge drawn
by swans with gold collars-some of these splendid birds are centenarians-and manned by Australian Beefeaters from the Tower of
London. At the expiration of his year of office, the LORD MAYOR, if a single man, is created a Knight Bachelor, and he is generally
expected to defray all the expenses of having his portrait painted, framed, and hung up in the Venetian parlour, without a sigh.
*The Sheriffs are always twins. To prevent mistakes, they are distinguished the one from the other by different coloured tapes.
They are selected in infancy by a Committee, composed of the wives of the Aldermen who have passed the Chair, from the families of
the most eminent among the Liverymen; and they are carefully brought up by hand from their cradle in the exercise of all such
faculties and accomplishments-elocation, for example, a rare judgment of wines, stenography, short whist, tandem driving, and a
minute knowledge of the history of the various Civic Companies—as will befit them in after life for the discharge of their exalted func-
tions. At an early age the future Sheriffs are familiarised with the Guildhall, the Mansion House, and, the Old Bailey, and, weather
permitting, seats are reserved for them and their female attendants to view the Lord Mayor's Show, as soon as they are able to clap their
hands and exhibit other outward tokens of delight.
The duties of the Sheriffs are multifarious. They accompany the LORD MAYOR in his hunting excursions in Epping Forest; assist
him in the preparation of his speeches, dine with him (alternately) every Sunday, and supervise the menus of the Mansion House
banquets. One of the Sheriffs must be an Alderman, and sleep every night during his term of office in the Bank of England. The
Sheriffs write to each other daily, and wear the Lord Mayor's portrait next their heart. They have coals, candles, gas, and water found
for them free of cost, and their laundry expenses (up to a certain amount) are defrayed out of the Coal Duties. When the Sheriffs throw
off the chains of office, they betake themselves, on an average, to farming pursuits and field sports, and preserve their faculties unimpaired
to an extreme old age.

OPERATIONS IN THE EAST.
Our Scotch friends, some of them, are likely
to misunderstand a recent telegram from Philip-
popolis :-
“The weather is now perfect for operations, but nothing
| is being done at Shipka.”
There are those among the countrymen of BURNS
whom the foregoing intelligence will cause to ask,
“Where are the Surgeons ?” It is too probable
that in surgery, just now, there is a great deal
being done at Shipka.

Mens Sana in Corpore Sano.
Which, being interpreted, means there are sane
men in the Seine (Legislative) Body. At all
events, there are no less than thirty-six medical
representatives in the new French Chamber of
Deputies. Strange to say, Doctors do not disagree
for once, for only two out of the number are Non-
Republicans. Are these two related to Doctor
Tant-pis or to Doctor Tant-mieux ?
The Satirical Dog!
A BUILDER in Taunton, having some ground tu

AN ODD IDEA OF IRISHMEN.
MR. BIGGAB, Mr. PARNELL, and other Irish Gentlemen,
Home-Rulers, Agitators, and Patriots, should be parti-
cularly amused by some information contained in the
letter of a Times Correspondent at Rome, which, in an
account of the Cardinals, their views and probable
courses, represents the Italian people as entertaining a
very singular opinion of the Irish :-
"Of Cardinal CULLEN, who has been a member of the Sacred
College for eleven years, and is now in his seventy-fifth year,
the Italians only know that he is an Irishman, and in their
opinion sure, therefore, to follow any course which can put him
into a total contradiction to his English colleagues; for it is a
matter of general belief in Rome that antagonism to England is
the only motive of Irish action. · These people are convinced
that Ireland stuck to Rome in the sixteenth century merely
because England went asunder from it, and they take it for
granted that Ireland would at once fall into Protestantism, or
into no matter what beresy, the moment England made a bign
of going back to the POPE."
The true Irishman can take a joke, and, bow terribly
soever in earnest, ever relishes humour. What fun,
then, he must see in the utter misconception the Italians
have formed of his countrymen and himself! Knowing
and feeling the dominant peculiarities of the Irish
character to be conscientiousness, consistency, steadiness,
circumspection, veracity, reflection, common sense, and
practical intellect, the contrast presented to it by the
Italian idea of it cannot but appear ridiculously absurd
to him. As if, during the last Session, the profound policy
of impeding legislation, 80 persistently pursued by the
National Obstructives, could possibly have been inspired
simply by a dull, stupid, perverse, ill-conditioned, malig-
nant, blind, unreasoning, silly, and childish spirit of
opposition! The notion that, in matters of politics, and
even of religion, the course of Ireland as a nation is
wont to be determined by mere antagonism to England,
so that because the English go one way the Irish there-
fore, and for that reason only, go another, seems to
suggest the prevalence of some confusion of mind in

WRONG WITHOUT REMEDY.
REALLY the Palladium of British Liberty, trial by
Jury, may be almost considered to be itself on its trial.
Witness the following extract from a contemporary,
exemplifying another case of
“MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE.—The HOME SECRETARY has
written to Mr. JUSTICE LUSH, who presided at the Manchester
Assizes, granting a free pardon to the three men, GREENWOOD,
WILD, and JACKSON, who were sentenced by Mr. Justice Haw.
KINS at the Liverpool Summer Assizes to ten years' penal
servitude for an outrage ... at Burnley on the 1st of July last.
Three men, named SUTCLIFFE, CROSSLEY, and MALLINSON, were
charged at the Manchester Assizes, on Saturday last, with
having committed the same alleged outrage. The Manchester
Jury found that no such outrage had been committed, and the
prisoners were discharged, Mr. Justice Lush intimating that he
would take steps to have the others set at liberty.”
Accordingly they have received a free pardon. A
pardon, describable in popular phrase as “free, gratis,
for nothing"- for not having committed the crime they
were found guilty of, and for which they have had to
undergo several months of penal servitude!
Mistakes will happen in the best constituted Courts
of Justice, which, of course, are those wherein a British
Judge presides over a British Jury. But when they
have occurred, is not some little compensation justly due
to the sufferers from “Miscarriage of Justice"? Of
course victims who have been hanged cannot be in-
demnified, but some amends might surely be made to
those who have endured false imprisonment and penal
servitude. Having been punished in the interests of
Society for warning to evil - doers, but wrongfully
punished, do they not deserve to be regarded as å
sort of martyrs (especially those who have actually
been executed) to the public good ? In addition,
therefore, to the deliverance which the Law calls á
“pardon," equity must pronounce them entitled to
reparation to the tune of something handsome. The
indemnity, moreover, to make it the more gracious,
should be accompanied with the thanks of a grateful
country.

RUM FELLOWS AT ROMSEY.
The town of Romsey in Hampshire, famous for its
Abbey, is also renowned for its vicinity to Broadlands,
which latter circumstance may in part account for the
title adopted, as appears from a paragraph of local news,
by a subdivision of one of the convivial Orders of -
"ODDFELLOWSHIP.-On Thursday evening a Lodge to be
called the Palmerston Lodge of the Antediluvian Order of Odd-
fellows, was opened at the Swan Hotel, of which Primo W.
YOUNG, K.M.C., is the host.”
A Palmerston Lodge of Oddfellows at Romsey is an
obviously intelligible association, but why does the Order
bear the name of Antediluvian? “Palmerston” and
“Antediluvian" seem incompatible terms. Lord PAL-
MERSTON was a Statesman credited with being in advance
of his age, and never supposed to be possessed with obso-
lete ideas. It was not PALMERSTON, but METTERNICI,
who said Après moi le Déluge.
Moreover, Romsey may be considered to be, physically
if not morally, a diluvial rather than an antediluvian, or
at least an alluvial soaky kind of place-a wet town.
It is irrigated by the River Test. Old inhabitants of
neighbouring towns and villages call it Romsey on the
Mud. They wax wroth with anyone who may happen
unawares to ask them if they have been to Romsey.
Having been to Romsey” is, in their language, a
phrase for having partaken of too much beer. It
implies that he who may have walked to Romsey
straight, has returned walking zigzag, or been con-
veyed back in a state of inability to walk at all. Hence,
to be sure, Romsey, in one particular at least of manners
and customs, may be supposed to remain pretty much
what it was in our grandfathers' good old times, in a
sense antediluvian, as the saying is. In that sense,
possibly, an Order of Odd Fellows may have assumed
and may glory in the title of “Antediluvian," and one
of its Lodges at Romsey may be deemed to have been
established in the right places.

ONE TO BE WON.
(By one who will not W00.)
FRIEND, would you know fair CYNTHIA's charms ?
She bears no lapdog in her arms:
No vulgar pride of show she feels,
Wears no low dresses, nor high heels,
Nor corset in the fashion laced,
To cause deformity of waist.
Her voice is ever sweet and low,
She ne'er talks slang, nor votes men slow.
She dances with exceeding grace ;
Ne'er dyes her hair, nor daubs her face.
Good music she can sing and play,
Nor practise her six hours a day:
Can make a fichu, catch a fish,
Or play a rubber, if you wish :
Can dine, if need' be, on cold mutton,
Can stew a çarp, and sew a button :
Can don her bonnet in a minute :
Can pass a mirror, nor look in it:
Can swim, and sketch, and row, and ride,
And do a hundred things beside.
At breakfast she is never late,
At balls ne'er bids the carriage wait:
For exercise ne'er fears to walk,
With soandal's tongue ne'er loves to talk :
Ne'er simpers, sulks, nor slams the door,
Nor sighs because the Season 's O'er-
Ah! were I tired of single life,

Bot The Cow won'T BE DRIVEN OUT OF THE PATHWAY, AND WHAT IS THOMPSON TO DO?!
If the rope break-such ropes have snapped before-
What follows - Punch's Sibyl says no more.
.
THE “TUG OF WAR.”
“PULL, France; Pull, Marshal!” 'Tis a sorry sight
To see Wrong stubborn in the name of Right.
To see the choice of France set down his heel
Against the will of France and France's weal.
To see one who affects the Bayard pose
As France's friend in league with France's foes.
Call it no worse than blunder-though the line
'Twixt treason and such blander is but fine-
Sad to see e'en an honest blunderer do
The work and will of a dishonest crew.
“Pall, Marshal-pull- nor yield an inch !” they bawl.
“Yield but an inch, and in the gulf you fall!”
So in Law's cause 'gainst Law he takes his stand;
On plea of Peace to civil war lends hand;
Invests foul Treason in church alb and cope,
Gives Wrong too much-and Right too little-rope;
Order's defender digs poor Order's grave,
And slays the Constitution he would save;
In Freedom's name joins those that Freedom dread,
And paints her bideous as a Spectre Red.
Gainst his own honour pulls, yet seems to say,
'Tis honour that forbade him to give way.
'Gainst France's progress pulls, and France's peace-
France, still so blest with thrift and earth's increase,
Could she but break with her long-troubled past,
Get Revolution's shadow from her cast,
She must the prosperous paths of plenty tread,
With graceful port and high-erected head :
But this ill-chosen guardian still must check
Her onward march, or guide it at his beck;
Must have her foot move as he wills it fal,
Or, failing his will, wills no move at all.
So with no treasonous thought, perhaps, before,
It comes to what we see—"The Tug of War!”
On this side, France, that not an inch will bate,
On that, the Marshal just as obstinate-
For Rope, the little senatorial band,
That betwixt Rights and Lefts takes central stand.

Small doubt, methinks, which way the Tug will go :

butions to a “ Young Review " are, ipso facto, unreliable ?
Will he inform a select audience at Hawarden that he has it on
the authority of an official at the Turkish Baths, who heard it from
a waiter at the Alhambra, who gathered it indirectly from a
Wapping Lascar, that the present Sultan absolutely doesn't know
the name of the only recognised Member for Greenwich ”
Will he appear, on a shilling gala day, at the Crystal Palace, and
explain, in the midst of appropriate fireworks, the nature of his
recent quarrel with the proprietors of a largely-circulated daily
paper ?
Will he make arrangements to take a part in the after-portion of
a Christmas pantomime, and, at his own request, carry on a pre-
arranged conversation with the Clown on the subject of Mr. ARCHI-
BALD FORBES ?
Will he, on or about the Fourteenth of February next, publicly,
in the columns of the Times, accuse MUSURUS PASHA of having sent
him an inexpensive and ribald valentine ?
Will he, further, in Parliament, move for the appointment of a
Select Committee " To inquire into, and report upon, the present

HOW TO CALCULATE
“INTEREST."
DEAR PUNCH,
I CALCULATE that when your
BEACONSFIELD took to cracking up
his patriotism, he kinder overlooked
the great United States, or he'd not
have been so proud of his little game.
Talk of looking after British in-
terests! Let him come and see how
we look after ours. Guess if that's
his notion of patriotism, he's got
considerable some to learn. I'll
tell him the way we fix our interests
with the Indians-darn their skins !
We conclude that their territory is
necessary for our interests. Waal,
we're patriots, we are. So we make
a treaty to say we won't take it. In
April, say. Then in May we violate
the treaty. They show fight, those
cusses, they dew. Then we ex-
terminate all around. And our
interests are secured, you bet.
Now your BEACONSFIELD never
looked after your interests yet,-
not to that extent, he didn't. But
if that's patriotism,- as you bet it
is,—why don't the noble patriot
politicate accordingly, and walk into
Egypt right away, or annex the Indian
Famine Fund, and let the population
squar down natural.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Such fame as I may still claim rests, I hear, on the anecdotes of
me, compiled and given to the world by one, whose reverence for
me in life seemed alike inconsistent with his nationality, incommen-
surate with his intelligence, and irreconcileable with his habits.
That SAMUEL JOHNSON should owe what reputation he still retains
to JAMES BOSWELL, is an instance of the irony of fate as startling
as any I have employed to point the moral of the most pungent of
my Poems.
One anecdote of me, transmitted by my Scottish Biographer,
recalls a conversation between myself and Dr. GOLDSMITH on the
heads which then crowned Temple Bar. Others record my love of
the great thoroughfare in which it stands; and one of the latter
connects my name with the observation, at first sight trivial,
"Sir, let us take a walk along Fleet Street”
Sir, I am not at this distance of time disposed to retract that re-
commendation. Nor do I think that any one who may have fol-
lowed it intelligently, will have had reason to regret his compliance
with my advice.
I should be glad to learn that my statue was to be set up in the
Strand, opposite the site of Temple Bar, looking towards St. Paul's,
and with these words inscribed on its pedestal. I fear that, except
yourself, Sir, there are not many now living who know the spirit
in which Fleet Street should be perambulated, or are capable of
deriving from their walk those lessons which it is capable of affording
to the observer of men and manners. I was: so was Dr. GOLDSMITH :
80 was Sir JOSHUA: so was WILLIAM HOGARTH.
Let me hope that such a statue, so inscribed, may lead some to
walk where I and these once loved to walk, and in a kindred spirit.
I address this letter to you, Sir, as I understand that you follow,
at whatever distance, in the footsteps which I left imprinted in the
Rambler and the Idler, and that, like me, you are at once an in-
habitant and a perambulator of the most crowded, and, as such, the
most instructive, thoroughfare in the world.
I have the honour to inscribe myself, Sir,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SOME RECOMPENSE FOR A WRONG.
MR. Punca is happy to see that the Gov.
ernment, adopting the suggestion of a jurist
whom modesty forbids him to name, have re-
cognised the position that a just and generous
country is bound in justice and generosity
to make reparation to guiltless persons made
examples of for their country's good.
“ The three men named WILD, JACKSON, and
GREENWOOD, who were wrongly convicted of an
outrage on the woman BLACKBURN, near Burn-
ley, and who, after being pardoned,' were re-
leased from Pentonville Prison, eleven days ago,
each received on Saturday a letter, which had
been sent by the direction of the HOME SECRE-
TARY, stating that, o
them, a gratuity of £5 108. would be forwarded
to them."
For “gratuity" read “compensation."
Though compensation” is, perhaps, rather
a large word; but in fixing such amounts or
such sums, the Government must, of course,
be limited by the means of the nation.

ENGLAND'S BLACK AND WHITE PAGES.
IF Britannia's heart is so often saddened by certain black pages
of her own account books, such as the hideous picture of vice,
brutal coarseness, and not less brutal selfishness, brought to light
by such an exposure as that of “Three Weeks with the Hop-
Pickers," in last month's Frazer, or the statistics of Liverpool
drunkenness, profligacy, and crime; or sessions and assize comment
on the life of any of our large cities, Manchester or Birmingham,
Bristol or Glasgow, Edinburgh or Newcastle-upon-Tyne-there
are white pages in the same book, opened before us from time to
time, to cheer us by their contrast.
Such a page is that which records the dinner given to Sir
STAFFORD NORTHCOTE at Exeter, at which the kindliness of old
acquaintance, the warmth of country neighbourhood and good-
fellowship, and the cordiality of mutual regard and respect, are
used to mellow the bitterness of party, and to sweeten the atmos-
phere of political strife. While opponents in the battle of public
life can meet on such terms as prevailed at that Exeter dinner, there
is no fear of cowardly manoeuvres, dirty dodges, or foul fighting.
And so long English public life will be a field for the Gentlemen of
England to fight in, and for the people of England to watch the battle,
and take part in it, all on their right sides and in their fit places, with-
out rancour, mutual distrust, or anything but the good old English
rule of fair play, “a clear stage, no favour, and may the best man
win!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A ROUNDABOUT PAPER.
Punch is glad to give the publicity of his world-wide
circulation to a wonderful tale, not of a tub, let us hope,
though of a transport, taken from the Naval and Military
column of last Saturday's Daily News. The D. N.
prints the paragraph in small type. In this modest
typographical garb the story might escape notice. A
history so creditable to all concerned really ought not to
blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the minimum
of minion. Here it is :-
"Last week an order was issued from the Quartermaster-
General's Office, directing a detachment of the 15th Brigade
depot to be sent up to Chatham from the depot at Burnley, to
join the 30th Regiment. Instead, however, of the troops being
sent direct to Chatham, which they could have reached by rail
in the course of a few hours, they were taken all the way to
Portsmouth, where they were ordered to embark in her Majesty's
troopship Assistance, which conveyed them to Ireland. On
arriving at Dublin the Assistance was again ordered back to
Portsmouth, where, on the arrival of the vessel, the troops were
disembarked, and finally sent on to this garrison by railway.”
There! We call that something like a paternal Quarter-
master-General's Office that does not shrink from putting
the country to some hundreds of pounds expense, to give
a deserving detachment the pleasure of an agreeable
"outing,” showing them one of our principal naval sta-
tions, and treating them to a run to the Irish capital
and back. And by sea, too, and in the month of Decem-
ber! So nice and bracing for them, dear fellows!
We have all heard of the Circumlocution Office.. That
belonged to the Civil Service. The Military Service has
improved upon it, and given us a “ Circumlocomotion
Office," over the door of which might be written, “The
longest way round is not the shortest way home."

YOUR REPRESENTATIYE.


SIR,
Tue Grasshopper has been produced at the Gaiety. Those who
have seen La Cigale in Paris must dismiss that fact from their
memory before going to see The Grasshopper in London. La Cigale,
on her native heath at the Variétés, began at about eight and
chirped till eleven. There was a short piece before it, I fancy, of
not much importance. La Cigale, however, was the pièce de résis-
tance. It was in three long Acts, whereof the first gave promise of
a brilliant melodramatic future-a promise never subsequently ful-
filled. The two French Authors—for in France it almost always
takes the same number to a piece as to a quarrel-had first-rate
materials for dramatic work in their hands, and made nothing of
them; for La Cigale is simply and plainly a very poor piece, qua
piece, considered apart from the acting in general, and from Mlle.
CHAUMONT's inimitable performance in particular.
The First Act was excellent, well played all round; DUPUIS good,
PARADE capital, the Showman and his artistes very funny, and the
CHAUMONT admirable. The Second Act was mere farce, excepting one
excellent bit of comedy between Mlle. CHAUMONT and LASSOUCHE,
who, however, finished what he had to do in the Act in the
broadest burlesque style. The audience roared at it, because it was
LASSOUCHE, I suppose, and because they had long before tacitly
accepted the Second Act as a farce, and had been allowed by the
authors to forget all about the dramatic interest of La Cigale.
The Third Act, played in a scene which was a wild caricature of
an artist's studio, was saved by some wonderful little pathetic
THE GATHERING OF THE EAGLES,
Down! The Bear's tightening grip has done its work.
A prisoner, baffled, bleeding, lies the Turk.
Down, not dishonoured ; at the victor's feet,
Yet who dare say the conquest is complete ?
A gallant fight! No gladiator, prone
In the net's folds, too strongly, surely thrown,
E’er better won the generous applause
Which greets stark courage, in whatever cause.
The breathless Bear, all scarred and staggering, stands
And licks the wounds dealt by those desperate hands,
Admiring, doubting, jubilant yet grave,
As the brave should be who have quelled the brave.
Down, but not dead yet! On the darkened air
Resounds the whirr of wings. The quarry there,
Prostrate at last, is one which ravening beaks
Have long been keen to rend ; from far the sbrieks
Of the obscener wingèd things are heard-
Eagle and vulture, kite and baser bird.
The Bear alone thé foe has dared confront,
Alone of that fierce battle borne the brunt,
But to the field, for rending of the prey,
Many will flock that never shared the fray.

To shed on her doings and dwellers
The light from an Asian sky.
One industry that favoured borough
Has based on her fair beechen woods,
The making of chairs, pails, and platters,
And all sorts of “turnery” goods.

Of arms and of legs-four by four-
That from kitchen and bed-room ascending,
To Windsor, in apogee, soar.

Where so many Windsors they frame,
In this blessèd month of December

With Hughenden's Lord to take luncheon, -
A grace deigned few subjects before.
Sore travailed the brains of the borough,
Of Aldermen, Town-Clerk, and Mayor !
Who shall tell of the meetings and motions,
And appeals—as of right-to the Chair ?
How should High Wycombe rise to its highest,
Its loyal invention to show,
In building an archway triumphal,
For the QUEEN underneath it to go!
Christmas evergreens, holly and laurel,
Were there, but such archways were stale;
Mere battens, distemper, and canvas,
Were all in the common-place pale ;
Till 'twas planned—who proposed it we know not,
His blushes posterity spares —
Both her trade and her loyalty Wycombe,
Should proclaim in an archway of chairs !
Of all arches ever passed under
By Royal Procession before,
Never aroh displayed loyalty greater,
And none e'er struck Royalty more.
There was but one feature a-wanting.

Had Lord BEACONSFIELD posed, emblematic,
A-poising a neat Windsor chair !

Walked out to the lawn, and proceeded
To plant a memorial tree !
Was 't a growth from the islands Pacific,
Or a shoot from some battle-fed seed,
With promise of Sang-de-Bouf blossoms,
And wood good for gun-stocks at need?
Whatever the tree that was planted
At Hughenden Manor that day,
Toʻthe trees our QUEEN plants 'tis the usage
That we should have something to say.
There's war on Bulgarian mountains,
And war in Armenian plains,
But to England, that watches the battles,
Thank God! blessèd peace still remains ;
And ere she takes hand from the ploughshare
And loom to lay hand to the sword,
Be assured she will well weigh the reason,
With due faith in her QUEEN and my Lord.
Oh, what was the tree my Lord ordered,-
Or was it the QUEEN that bespoke ?
Was it poplar, or alder, or laurel P-

From a Hebrew root shot up in no time,
With a coronet-flower, newly blown?

In the Isle of Man, on New Year's Eve, they drink
elder wine flavoured with rosemary, and eat buns soaked
in warm ale. When the clock strikes twelve the com-
pany all rise, link little fingers, dance round the hearth
on one leg, and sing “ Rule, Britannia !” to the accom-
paniment of the hand-bells.
The customs and superstitions of the Channel Islands
at this season are a mine of interest to the antiquary and
connoisseur. The horror of carraway-seeds, the respect
paid to the magpie, the indispensable ingredient of
caviare in the mince-meat, the shouting the names of
departed ancestors down the streets at midnight, and
the curious practice, among the lower orders, of pelting
each other with hard-boiled eggs (painted bright orange)
on Boxing Day, may be cited as a sample of the old-
world usages which still linger in these delightful re-
treats.
In North Wales it is held to be lucky to eat an egg
from the wrong end on New Year's Day. The egg must
be a turkey's egg, and stained purple, and the person who
takes it out of the nest must have blue eyes and a
majestic countenance.
In South Wales ill-luck is considered to attach to the
man who does not either wear a new hat on Christmas
Day, or part his hair down the middle, without speaking
a word to any one, before breaking his fast in the morning.
Both in North and South Wales, to spill the salt at
table on Christmas Day is looked upon as a particular
misfortune, which can only be remedied by the trans-
gressor standing at the open street-door, during the rest
of the meal, with a blood-orange in each hand, stuck
with chips saved from the last Christmas Yule Log, for

But the baste wid her tantrums well-nigh bruk his heart;
For never a stip would she move, the ould rip!
But she stood like a pig wid her legs wide apart.

"Is it batin'?” says Pat. “By the Saint in my hat!
'Tisn't batin' she cares for-bad luck to the slut!
Ochone and ochone! if I'd only a stone !”
"A stone !” says the Priest-ah thin, wasn't he artful?
“A stone! Why, ye Omadhaun, look at yer cartfull!”
“Thrue for you!" Pat sings out; "them's the jockeys

And clutching two handsful with joyous "hurroo,”
He let fly in haste at the back of his baste,

By the onld one himself, for a good rood or two.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

“JE N'EN VOIS PAS LA NÉCESSITÉ.”
THE Italian House of Commons has voted the Penal
Code proposed by the Minister of Grace and Justice,
Signor MANCINI, which, besides abolishing capital punish-
ment, amid the applause of the galleries, admits neces-

enacted, would indeed be a saying clause for criminals.
If, according to our English form of indictment, Italians
commit crimes because of “ being instigated by the
deyil," and necessity is to extenuate crime, and “needs
must when the devil drives”—who need ever be hanged,
even if the gallows were left standing ? Luckily, Italy
has a House of Lords in her Senate, which may be safely
trusted to veto-if, indeed, it have not already vetoed -

ments, and domestic economy, formed another principal feature in
the Ladies' crusade. Some seventy courses have been delivered on
physiology, public health, gymnastics, chemistry, cooking, and
nursing. Branch associations have been formed, day nurseries
have been opened, houses cleaned, cleansing materials lent, clothing
clubs formed, and even a company for building suitable dwellings
for the poor. Poor London children have been fed, cared for, and
made happy, in a humble way. Baths, washing-tubs, pails, brooms,
and brushes, disinfectants, cooking utensils, and nursing appliances,
patterns of garments, made and unmade, text-books on domestic
economy, models of filters, drain-traps, ventilators, invalid cooking
and nursing appliances, have been kept and lent for purposes of
illustration.
The Association has helped to introduce into schools text-books
of domestic economy, and in its last tract, Our Schools and Public
Health, has tried to draw the attention of all engaged in training
the young to the importance of teaching physiology and the laws of
health.
In the face of the needs pressing and the work accomplished, the
Association may fairly take credit, in its own words, for having
laboured, “ by God's blessing, to secure happier, purer, more intelli-
gently-managed homes for England, and a healthier, more tempe-
rate, truer manhood and womanhood for her sons and daughters."

LET her come in! The New Year cannot bring
A guest more welcome, or a friend more needed.
Whilst echoes of our Christmas chants yet ring,
Is her benign appeal to pass unheeded ?
Hath “Peace on earth” lost meaning in their minds
Who mouth the text at this our holiest season,
But whom the red mirage of War so blinds
To the high beacon-lights of ruth and reason ?
Let her come in! Her claim is not the first,
Whilst evil lives to slay, and wrong needs righting.
There is a peace whose calm is more accurst
Than e'en the fiercest storm of righteous fighting.
But once the storm hath stricken- for the right,
As most men hold-and ancient wrong lies broken,
Let Peaceful Counsel bring her guiding light,
And sheathed sword twined with olive for a token.
Let her come in! Midst shipwreck's shocks and strains,
The hand of reason may well leave the rudder;
But thinking on those blood-dyed Eastern plains
The hardest hater of hoar wrong might shudder.
Not blood, not vengeance, is the Christian cry,
Death to the wrong, but not wrong-doer's slaughter !
Carnage is scarce so fair that we need fly
To hail the red-armed Fury as “God's daughter."
Let her come in! Whilst loud the joy-bells greet
The opening Year, a woful world may listen
To hear the gentle fall of those fair feet,
At whose soft sound Hope's sad eyes well may glisten.
Princes and Politicians, here's a guest
Whom roughly to repulse were blindest folly.
Let her come in, while with glad welcome's Zest
We twine her olive in our Christmas holly.
ROBINS IN THE WRONG PLACE.
Ar a swell wedding in the Hunting Metropolis, we read of Eleven
Bridesmaids in white Cashmere, polonaises, trimmed with holly,
mistletoe, and Robin Red-Breasts-dead Robin Red-Breasts !!
Since the time that kindly bird covered the Babes in the Wood
with leaves, even schoolboys' blood-thirstiness and roughs' reckless-
ness have spared the Robin-the bright-eyed, fearless friend of man
-the sweet little singer of winter.
It was reserved for these Eleven dainty Bridesmaids—or rather, let
us hope, for her who, without their cognisance or consent, planned
their trimmings—to rise superior to the piety which spares the “little
bird with bosom red.”
May the spirits of the slain Robins not sit, like the slain Albatross
on the conscience of the Ancient Mariner, on the souls of those Eleven
Bridesmaids, But we should like to give a trimming of our own to
the unwomanly woman who devised this cruel accompaniment of the
holly and mistletoe, emblems of kindliness, good-will on earth, and
innocent kisses.

Mem. Not to forget to recollect that we really must
invite my dear Mamma-in-Law to come and stay a

To the stable mind generally there is, perhaps, no sort
of news less readable than ecclesiastioal intelligence.
Yet habitual fox-hunters, and all men given over to
the Noble Animal, must needs feel a keen interest in
the question pending in the Established Protestant
Church of Prussia respecting the orthodoxy of the Rev.
Herr HOSSBACH. This Clergyman was lately nominated
incumbent of St. James's, Berlin, by a majority of his
congregation. Petitioned by a minority, the Branden-
burg Consistory Court has refused to confirm Herr Hoss-
BACH's appointment. The case stands referred to the
Supreme Consistory, with whom it rests to decide whether
or no HOSSBACH shall keep his seat. HOSSBACH, in the
meantime, sticks on, and goes in to win. He stands a
good chance, for HOSSBACH is a very Broad Church-

clerical canter.
