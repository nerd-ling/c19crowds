PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TUNNUURW
M HE night was dark; only a far-off gleam on the horizon gave faint and doubtful promise of a better day. The low
rumbling of recent thunder rolled in the distance. Flashes of lightning ever and anon told of an atmosphere still
charged with electricity, even if this had not been proclaimed by the sulphurous and stifling air.
But what is this discord that bursts upon the darkness ?
Squeakings and shriekings, groanings and gaspings, grumblings in veiled basso profondo alternating with squeals in
agonising alto, confusion worse confounded of sharps and flats, dominants and subdominants, crotchets and quavers, diplomatic
semitones and undiplomatic protests—mingled squawkings as of strings violently pulled many ways, blarings as of brass,
wailings as of wind-
Never did more horrible charivari make night more hideous.
“ Confound the cats ! ” murmured Punch, as he turned uneasily on his hot and rumpled pillow.
“Not cats, Master,” growled Toby, from his post of guard at the bed-side; "only the Berlin Orchestra tuning for the
European Concert.”
It was hard to believe that the long-promised Concert was coming off at last. But PUNCH can trust his
watch-dog.
The Master was wide-awake at once, up and dressed, and deep in the list of the principal performers which Toby had
handed to him.
BEACONSFIELD and BISMARCK, to alternate the duties of Conductor and First-Fiddle ; SALISBURY for BEACONSFIELD'S
Second-Fiddle; SCBOUVALOFF, Big-Drum and Leader of the Russian Horn Band; ANDRASSY, Ophicleide; WADDINGTON,
Flute and French Cor de Chasse; CORTI, Viol da Gamba; MEHEMET, Cymbals, Tambourine, and Turkish Crescent ;
Roumanian Guzla, Greek Lyre, Jew's-harp, and other minor instruments incidental to the Concert, by Messrs. BRATIANO,
DELYANNIS, the Leaders of the Israelitish Alliance, and others.
“Quite a star-orchestra," murmured the Master. “What a pity they didn't get it together two years ago! Why
should Europe have had to wade her way to her concert through a sea of blood, across a waste of war strewed with hideous
wreck of massacre, ath wart misery untold-famine and death, and outrage worse than death? And what & discord by
way of introduction! But the more trouble in tuning, the more chance, let us hope, of harmony to come."
: So saying, but with a sigh of misgiving, Punch made his way to the concert-room through a double row of
Special Correspondents who bowed respectfully as he passed.
BF.ACONSFIELD, bâton in hand, was at his side in a twinkling-leaving his seat, for a moment, to SALISBURY, his
Second-Fiddle, who seemed ill at ease under the new respon:ibility. Was he thinking of the Conference of Constantinople,
and what it came to ?
“What can I do for you, my dear and illustrious confrère ? " exclaimed BEACONSFIELD, blandly, as he made a move-
ment to take Punch's hand.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JULY 6, 1878,
“Let me see your programme," said Punch, politely waiving the proffered courtesy.
“Of course I have settled it all beforehand with SCHOUVALOFF and BISMARCK—but only provisionally," hastily
observed BEACONSFIELD.
“Somebody must setrle," rejoined the Master, “or we should have the music in a nice muddle. But you ought
to have taken me into council."
BEACONSFIELD, for once, blushed, as he handed Punch & paper.
“You will see it is by no means as SCHOUVALOFF would have had it,” he continued, complacently. “St. Petersburg
taste is barbaric. They uuderstand nothing but brass and wind; and their best players are always making false notes. We
have modified the Panslav Movement very considerably; cut short the Russian March, and altogether suppressed IgnatiEFF'S
Overture to the Siege of Constantinople; besides curtailing their Bulgarian symphony, of which there was ridiculously toy
much. It is true we have given them the • Blaue Donau' Waltz, with the Sofia, Schum'a, and Varna variations, the Bessa-
rabian scherzo, and the Batoum barcarole, but en revanche we have restored the Balkan passages for the Turkish band.”
“ But how about the integrity and independence of the Ottoman'?”.
BEACONSFIELD shrugged his shoulders. “A mere façon de parler. We know what that sort of thing means," he
added, with a smile. “All very well for a Jingo air at the Music Halls, but in a European Concert !"- and he winked,
and all but whistled as he put his finger to his nose, with an air of infinite significance. “But there was no alternative,
ANDRASSY has been very troublesome. We all know he has a difficult part to play, but he will play it in his own time and
way, no matter at what risk of the general harmony. It is arranged that the Viennese troupe are to lead the Bosnian and
Herzegovinian Concerto. If they don't find themselves in a mess before they have done—but that is their affair. As for
England "
“You will allow me a voice," interposed Purch, firmıly, “ when it comes to the English part of the programme.
Though I am not precisely a Wagnerian, in the European Concert England must go in for the Music of the Future,' with
Peace and Progress, Justice and National Right, for her key-notes. Ah, if we could only cut down the military bands, German
and French, Austrian and Russ, alike! Amidst the overpowering din of big drums and trumpets, trombones, fifes, and bugli-s,
the European Concert may yet end in a worse charivari than this with which it opens.”
“At all events, I hope you 'll like my setting of 'Humpty Dumpty?'” anxiously whispered BEACONSFIELD, “ what-
ever the Turks may have to say to it."
The less of that air the better," said Purch; "at least, without an Eoglish Conductor for the Turkish iostruments,
and one whom England can trust. At any rate, you had better let me give you a lead. Here is my Music-Buok.”
So sayivg, Puncu placed on the stand his
Seventy-Fourth Volume,
and with BEACONSFIELD still nominally in possession of the búton, but well under Puxcu's eye, proceeded to Educate the
Educator.

A YOUNG HUSBAND'S
LAMENT.
Oh, I am weary, weary,
Of that pretty pinky face,
Of the blank of its no meaning,
The gush of its grimace.
And I am weary, weary,
Of her silly, simpering ways,
Bugles, buckles, buttons, spangles,
Tight tiebacks, tighter stays.
And I am weary, weary,
Of that hollow little laugh,
Of the slang that stands for
humour,
Of the chatter and the chaff.
Sick of the inch-deep feeling
Of that hollow little heart,
Its" too lovely ” latest fashions,
Its“ too exquisite” high Art.
Its Church high, higher, highest,
Their Curates and their clothes,
Their intonings, genuflections,
Masqueradings, mops and mows.
But I must curb my temper,
Grumbling helps not wedlock's
ills.
Fashion, High Church, or Æsthe-
tics,
Let me grin and pay the Bills!

THERE can no longer be any
doubt about the existence of a
marine ophidian hitherto regarded
by the majority of naturalists as
fabulous. This day the Sea Serpent
comes up the Thames, stretching

A Gunpowder Plant is discovered
in the Island of Cyprus. It bears
fruit in the form of cartridges con-

ignited. This plant has no affinity
whatever to the Chinese shrub
yielding Gunpowder Tea. Its fruit
ripens in the beginning of Novem-

(By our own private Astrologer-espe-
cially engaged.)
Autumn Quarter. - Good
time to stay with friends at

hunting for the first time in
their lives on young untrained
horses.
APPROPRIATE QUOTA-
TIONS.
“ALL 's Swell that ends
swell,” as ’ARRY remarked
when he purchased a pair of
misfits."

woods are green,” as Pater-
familias observed when all the
doors in his new villa took to
warping.
“For this re-leaf much
thanks," as the trees said at
the coming of Spring.
THE TABLES TURNED.— The
complaint about schools now-
adays is that instead of being
a case of "Dotheboys” it is one
of “Dotheparents."

name for the means of plunder
employed by a large class of
small tradesmen.
HOW TO SUPPLY A COMMON
DEFICIENCY. -"If you haven't
an idea”—borrow one of some-
body who has.
CONSISTENCY. A gentleman
attracted by a beautiful foot,
seeks the owner's hand.

As through his coil of wondrous wires,
With tiny tubes like flowrets hung,
A-throb with life of lightning fires,
Punch greets the wide world, tongue to tongue,
To all the shores, o'er all the seas,
He sends, as erst, a glad “New Year,”
From lips whose smile but ill agrees
With most that strikes his listening ear.
There's war and woe in East and South,
And yet more woe and war to be ;

With wrath and want at work abroad,
And ill-times and ill-deeds at home,
'Tis hard to raise the New Year Land
'Gainst wailings that athwart it come.
Brim bowl, and let the brandy blaze,
Toss the glad toast from lip to lip;
His blithest bark let Toby raise,
And pipe all hands to "wear the ship”
From War's black reefs and blood-stained waves
To Peace's sunny-sleeping sea;
From Famine's toil, and tale of grapes,
To full-fed Plenty, feasting free.
'Tis easy wished! Were Punch's will
As potent as his heart is wide!
But the world's great loom stands not still,
Nor weaveth as our wisdoms guide.
The pattern of its warp and woof
We read not while the shuttle goes,
But we have faith, on Man's behoof,
That the World-Weaver works and knows.
Our New Years are as Old to him ;
His worlds and ours have different names :
His bright may oft to us show dim,
His gain seem loss, His glories shames.
Still it roars on, that mighty loom,
Nor let hope die, and heart repine,
While joy and woe, success and doom,
Work out the web of wise design.

FIRED doubtless by the example of the raid upon Christmas Cards
in the newspapers, and determined to better the instruction, the
writers of the following genial letters have sent Mr. Punch their
“seasonable" communications for publication.
MR. PUNCH,
Lower Tooting
WERE you not a man, I might possibly respect you. But,
as I hate the whole of your sex, I can but regard you with feelings
of loathing and contempt. Still, I am more likely, perhaps, to receive
justice at your hands than at the hands of any of your brothers. I
write to protest against the sending of Valentines. The men who send
them are impudent puppies, and the women forward minxes. I have
no patience with either! I never received but one Valentine myself,
and that was of an insulting character-suggesting that I was over
forty, when even now I am barely thirty by three. I sent it to my
Solicitor. That was more than ten years ago, and he has not yet
discovered the libeller. If he had, I would have taught the
creature the penalty of propagating libellous lies, even under the
vulgar disguise of a Valentine.
Yours indignantly,
VIRGINIA VERJUICE.

“St. ALBAN'S? WHERE IS THAT?”.
“HOLBORN !”
THE ASS IN THE LION'S SKIN.
CEASE, Neddy! in the name of mercy, cease!
Spare us these blasts of self-complacent braying,
Wbile for the coming of the New Year's Peace
All ears are listening, and all hearts are praying.
Take the tin trumpet from those foolish lips-
Not, as you dream, the mouth-piece of the nation.
When skies are dark with fear of War's eclipse,
We do not need your music's aggravation.
Long have you wrought the Lion to arouse,
With noise that he calls braying, you call thunder ;
When, to play Lion, donkeys cease to browse,
As far as row goes Lion may knock under.
But when the lordlier brute's ill-fitting skin
You put on, leonine duties forth to blazon,
All but fools know you, nor regard your din
Braggart and bumptious, bellicose and brazen,
What do you know of Leo's kingly way,
You, who misconstrue calm as coward quaking ?
There needs more than the will to lift a bray
Into a Lion's roar to fight awaking !
Like Bottom, you suppose the Lion's part
All roaring, as your bravery is all bragging,
And fancy the great beast is losing heart,
Because you cannot see his tail still wagging.
Such force as yours is weakness to strong souls.
They hate the tricks of penny-trumpet fluster;
To them the most contemptible of rôles
Is frantic fidget and Bombastes' bluster.
We know our roads, be sure we'll keep them free,
Where our right leads our feet are prompt to follow;
But we'll not hang our boots on every tree,
In challenge as gratuitous as hollow.
Leo's tenacious of his right-of-way;
Foes who that right may venture upon blocking,
Must face a deeper note than the big bray
With which the Ass the Lion has been mocking;
But roaring round all roadways far and near,
Like some too-fussy cur that's always yapping,
Is a performance that suggests the fear
That thieves have but to will to take us napping.
The funk which fashions bogeys, and would arm
Our neighbours with assassin's mask and dagger;
The bounce which is the shield of weak alarm,
The self-distrust which cloaks itself in swagger;
The fustian patriotism, spun by length,
The high falutin' style, the cockerel cry,
May suit your aims and ears, but Leo's strength,
Couchant, with stretched arms, lets the jaw go by.
Detraction, bunkum, braggadocio, pour,
Unchecked, unchallenged, from your noisy throat.
“ 'Tis Ass's braying, and not Lion's roar,"
Men say, pass on, and take no further note.
Honour and Interest hand in hand with Peace
Stand now as always; who their clasp shall sever?
Asses in Lion's skins ? Pooh, Neddy ! cease.—
Whate'er the skin, bray will be bray for ever!
Better than the Telephone.
“Pgra!” said GRUMPUS, when he heard of Telephonic machines
enabling us to hear a man six hundred miles off, “the valuable
invention would be one to enable us not to hear loud and vulgar
chatter six inches off-in railway carriages and elsewhere-to say
nothing of street-cries in a suburban street, or your neighbour's
piano in a suburban house. That would deserve gratitude, if you
like."

rough work was the covering of SHAKIR Pasha's re-

a case of the right man in the right place. But it is only
fair to Turkey to say that a Shaker is an exception
among her generals. Traitor Pashas she may have had,
and Bungler Pashas in plenty ; but Shaker and Quaker

Now that the Ladies, thanks to the initiation of Lord BEACONS-
FIELD and the Royal condescension to his suggestions, are to be
permitted to share the decorations that have hitherto been reserved
for their Lords and Masters, we may soon expect an increase in the
Orders of Lady Knighthood. Always ready to meet the wants of the
hour, Mr. Punch begs to at once propose a new decoration, to be
called the Female Order of Merit. Candidates for election to this
new distinction will be expected to give satisfactory answers to the
following questions. The forms should be filled in and sent to Mr.
Punch, at 85, Fleet Street, where they will be examined and (if
deemed worthy of the honour) forwarded to the proper quarter.
1. Are you married or single? Give your opinion either of your
husband, or the male sex generally.
2. How much a year do you spend upon your dress ?
3. Have you ever made a pudding? If you have, what sort of
pudding was it, and how did your husband like it ?
4. When you are asked to sing, do you comply at once, or do you
hesitate, and say you have a cold ?

Beneath the edge to which she has been drawn,

ON THE DIZZY BRINK.
HALTE là! No further! Who are those would urge
BRITANNIA's steps towards that dizzy verge ?
Wild voices, deafening as the war-drum's din,
Howl “On!”—but tell of no clear goal to win.
And what besides wild voices? Would the hand,
To which is given the guidance of the land,
Lead darkly its reluctant charge to learn,
That once on that edge, 'tis too late to turn ?
Men doubt, and if their doubtings do him wrong,
Whose wiles are subtle as his will is strong,
Where lies the blame, save with his tortuous sleight
Who dons the mask of mystery with delight,
And, shrinking from plain policy's fair ways,
Invokes the dubious aid of fog and phrase ?
Howe'er it be, BRITANNIA's voice sounds clear,
Moved nor by failing nerve, nor selfish fear,
But the calm prudence, born of judgment sure,
Which Duty's beacon knows from Folly's lure.
“No further! That way shame and failure lie.
Such perils fools may court or dolts defy;:
Calm courage keeps its force for higher call
Than blatant summons to a bootlegs brawl.
No further on that road! If dangers meet
BRITANNIA on the pathway where her feet
Follow fair Honour's lead, she will not shrink.”
Then what does she upon yon giddy brink ?
Say, silly shouters, say, too devious guide!
The voices which so lustily have cried
In watchful England's o'er-taxed ears of late,
Something at length their empty noise abate.

Plain words at last. From weary week to week

INFANT WELSHING.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
You have, doubtless, seen the correspondence in the leading
paper over the correct spelling of the name of a certain Welsh
village. Is it not grand? And yet it is the fashion in certain
quarters to deny that the Welsh possess genius. Did the Saxon ever
invent anything equal to that name? I am a bachelor, ætat.-never
mind what-but a high figure. I am, moreover, rich. I am asked
twice a week to stand as sponsor to friends', children. I am god-
father to some twenty-seven brats who are encouraged by their
mercenary parents to be for ever writing to “dear god-papa," to
send him. Christmas Cards and February Valentines, to forward
him their school-prizes, and to work him slippers and nightcaps. In
some seventy cases I have refused, and have made some seven
times seventy enemies for life. My troubles are at an end. I will
never refuse again, but will always accept, on the one condition,
that my godchild bears a name of my selection, and that name will be
that of the Welsh village, Llanfairpwllgungwllgogerhwllolysiliogogo!
I wish you what are called the Compliments of the Season.
Crusty Lodge.

DEAD, in full-blow of strength, high-tide of blood !
The hunter's muscle, and the soldier's heart,
The frame so flush of life and lustihood,
All stark and still, and drest for King's last part.
The Victor dead, in prime of stalwart strength,
Apd over Tiber, scarce a stone's-throw down,
The Vanquished, at last span of his life's length,
Still living to bless him who took his crowa.
Fate loves her irony. Still, on Earth's scene,
We play in “ Contrasts " 'to our latest breath,
And all must mark Death that should Life have been,
And Life that flickers in chill gust of Death.
Here most, where the two Actors in the play
Are Italy's first King and last King-Pope.
The one so seeming-strong, bluff, gaillard, gay;
The one so seeming-weak, old, sad, past hope.
It is as if we saw two dying beds,
Two graves of even date dug side by side ;
King and Pope putting off old hates and dreads,
And changing words of kindness as they died.
'Tis all too soon their epitaphs to write,
That must be interwoven, line with line ;
Though the one's black show as the other's white,
And either need the other's foil to shine.
But both loved Italy with life-long love,
Both laid the course for her that they deemed best;
Thougb Pope marked shoals, where King at full-sail drove,
And this to larboard, that to starboard prest.
So they will stand, both, at the Future's bar,
Not blameless either, each with much to praise ;
King, blamed for man's sins that king's graces mar,
Pope, for unpriestly pride in the world's gaze.
A King coarse-fibred-but had finer-spun
Borne the rough strain of all he had to do,
Welding the sherds of Italy in one,
Facing fair work or foul that helped thereto?
'Twas not for nothing that the people gave
The name he bore, unchallenged, clear and clean,
“King Honest-Man"-a title above “brave,"
For brave all sons of Savoy still have been.
But honesty-fast faith to plighted word,
And charter sworn,-is rare among the breed
That still to Christian virtues have preferred
MACHIAVELLI's craft and pliant creed.
And if he had the faults that hang about
The neck of strength, he had the virtu es too :
The quick-lit lusts, wrath that blazed sudden out
And soon died down, hot hates and friendships true.
And through all change, as he swore kingly oath,
From first to last he set his will aside
And wrought his country's: true to plighted troth,
And Italy that gave herself his bride.
He guided her across the twilight time
Betwixt the death of old and birth of new;
And stayed her steps the darkling hill to climb,
Spite of shrill-shrieking tongues nor faint nor fow.
Saw the swift growth, the slow reform of wrong,
The weakness turning strength from day to day;
And when his tide of life, like hers, ran strong,
And seemed at flood, sudden, he passed away!
Leaving his kingly shield without a stain,
And his life's record, if not free from soil,
Blurred with the sins which strength can least restrain,
And weakness finds it easiest to foil. s
Carve on his tomb the title he loved best,
Which in the Italy he made means most.
With “ Il Re Galantuomo" on his breast,
He may sleep well-not making other boast.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

- RECOGNITION BY PROXY.
“On the 31st of March, 1876, John CHIDDY, a quarryman,
employed on the Great Western Railway, at Conham, between
Bath and Bristol, saw that a large stone had fallen upon the
metals along which the Flying Dutchman, then in sight, was
rushing at the rate of fifty miles an hour. Without a thought
of the risk he ran, CHIDDY rushed to the spot and lifted the stone
the line, and a terrible catastrophe was thus averted: but the
poor man lost his life, for the buffer catching him, he was killed
in an instant. He left a widow and seven children, and his case
being a peculiarly shocking one, some Gentlemen in Bristol took
it up. The Company when applied to denied their liability. The
passengers whose lives were saved by CHIDDY's heroic conduct
subscribed only a few pounds. A public appeal was then made,
resulting in the raising of between $400 and £500. With part
of this a neat six-roomed cottage has been built near the scene of
the accident, and this, with half an acre of garden land, was yes-
terday formally and publicly presented to the widow."
"ALL's well that ends well.” Luckily for brave and
self-devoted JOHN CHIDDY's widow and seven children,
there was a Public behind the Company whose property,
and the passengers whose lives, he sacrificed his life to
save. May this tardy recognition of John CHIDDY's self-
sacrifice by the subscribers who have secured a roof for
his widow and children, atone for the shameful over-
looking it by the Great Western Company and the passen-
gers in the train which he died to rescue from destruction.

MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
You are summoned to learn how we've striven
To put stop to this war and its crimes;
And to give your advice and assistance
In these very critical times.
We tried to stave war off, and couldn't-
Then neutral we promised to be,

Peace we promised our aid in promoting.
Now the Turk 's floored it seems the time's come.
First the Porte tried it on with the Powers,
But the Powers-by the powers, they were dumb!
Then the Turks asked BRITANNIA to help them,
And be passed the word to the Bear :
And we hope that what's passing betwixt them
May bring peace, in whose credit we'll share.
Thus far, our toes haven't been trod on,
And we earnestly hope they won't be ;
But if peace isn't made, there's no knowing

Mr. KNIGHT BELL said the Chairman had
anticipated a rush of females into the pro-
fession. Perhaps he was afraid it would
be an “ugly rush." On the contrary, the
danger was, that the rush would be a deal
too pretty. The female graduates in Medi-
cine would not be old women like those the
Chairman had alluded to. They would all
be young, and too many of them good-
looking and attractive. The family doctor,
therefore, would have to contend with them
at a great disadvantage, and he said this
feelingly. (Laughter.) Beauty would carry
it over brains. (Ironical Cheers.) To pre-
vent that, something ought to be done.
(Applause.)
Sir W. JENKINS discarded the apprehen-
sion that any injury would be done to
medical men by female practitioners. He
objected to them on public grounds, and
for their own sakes. Medical studies would
tend to destroy female grace and refine-
ment, and all those charms which rendered
ladies ornaments of the domestic circle.
(Hear.) The faculties of women's minds
upfitted them for medical reasoning. Life
and death were not to be trusted in their
fair but fragile hands. (Cheers.) These
considerations should determine the Union
to offer an organised opposition to the em-
ployment of medical women. It had been
said, “Why not leave it alone? None
need employ female doctors but those who
choose.” Such reasoning was specious, but
unsound. He wished it were possible for
the Profession to combine in a strike
against all employers of female medical
skill. But this, unhappily, was out of the
question. There was, however, one course
open to them, and he would earnestly
advise them to adopt that. He would ac-
cordingly move a Resolution—“That the
Amalgamated Medical Practitioners do one
and all pledge themselves to decline meet-
ing any female practitioner whomsoever,

The Resolution having been seconded by

AVING nothing else to do
(Lords, Monday, Jan. 21st),
their Lordships talked about
their Committee to Inquire
into the Evils of Water (in
the shape of floods), and their Committee to Inquire
into the Evils of Alcohol (in the shape of spirits).
(Commons.)-On bringing up of Report on the Address,
Mr. BENTINCK led up to talk and questions about the
acts and intentions of Russia, the attitude of Greece,
and Her MAJESTY's letter to the Czar.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said the Govern-
ment did not know what the Russian Terms were ; they
knew what they were not-those reported in the
morning's Turcophil Papers. (Nothing has been more
noteworthy in the Turco-Russian quarrel than the recklessness with which false news from Turkey has been foisted on English readers,
and false news from England on Turkish. The rule of these organs seems to have been modelled on the familiar “ Throw plenty of
mud, and some of it will stick”—Tell plenty of lies, and some of them will be believed.)
. Then to two Irish Bills. The first to authorise the Election of Justices of the Peace in Ireland by Unions. As the impression of
the House evidently was that this was not to bring Union, Justice, and Peace into closer connection, but to disguise Disunion, Injustice,
and War under the mask of lawful authority, no wonder the Second Reading of the Bill was Negatived by 138 to 38.
Next came Second Reading of the Irish Sunday Closing Bill, carried without a division, after a brief debate in which Mr.
O'SULLIVAN, Mr. BROOKS, Mr. Shaw, and the Major, declared that the Bill has been pushed in the teeth of the Irish People. Who
shall decide when Home-Rule disagrees ?
Bills brought in to amend the Merchant Shipping Act (Sir CHARLES ADDERLEY); to abolish the Action for Breach of Promise
(Mr. HERSCHELL, Q C.); and to amend the Law of Libel (Mr. HUTCHINSON); all three laws that respectively want abolition and
amendment much more than they are likely to get it.
Tuesday (Lords).- QUEEN's answer to the Address brought down.
The Duke of RICHMOND declines, for self and partners, any attempt to deal with the carriage-blocks at Hyde Park Corner.
How can inconsiderate people impose such superhuman tasks upon a Government ?
(Commons.)-The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER read to the House, to an accompaniment of cheers from both sides, the QUEEN'S
perfectly udobjectionable letter to the Czar, forwarding the Sultan's appeal for peace.
As Ministers bad sanctioned the letter, they were free to ask the QOEEN's leave to read it to the House of Commons. Not so with
the Czin's answer. That was private and confidential.

Might find some flaws, if few.

Of sour Xanthippe given to needless nagging;
But in your mouth, though eloquently flung,
The burthen sounds like bragging.

To take it for granted that Russia can hardly be at one and the
same time the most short-sighted of idiots and the most far-sighted
of plotters, a penniless bankrupt and the possessor of a Fortunatus'
purse, the most formidable of giants and the most contemptible of

To learn, from the history of the Crimean War, what happens
when H.M.S. Britannia is allowed to drift, instead of being steered.
To read up the Life of Lord Beaconsfield, and learn its lessons.
To teach Home-Rulers that England's difficulty is not Ireland's
opportunity, however Ireland's importunity may be England's
difficulty.
To discount Stock Exchange patriotism.
To be deaf to the beery bray of the Music Halls.
Not to take the Ass in the Lion's Skin for the Lion.
To avoid the bark that has no bite behind it.
To realise the cost of a war-direct and indirect-in men and
money, misery and demoralisation.
To read up the panics of the last century, and measure their
foundations by the light of history.
To bear in mind that if the counsels of the loudest clamourers for
British honour and British prestige had been followed the last half-
century would have seen us at war with France, Germany, and the
United States.
To remember that for a wise people the sword should be the last,
instead of the first, tool to be taken for cutting a knot.
To look the fact in the face, that those who most " want to fight”
are those who have the least to lose by it, and who will have to
bear the least of its brunt and its burdens.

In one week from weird Afric's land
Two visitors have reached our strand,
Each welcome, each a wonder;
Linking, in combination strange,
Two eras which on Time's long range
Lie distantly asunder.
Five thousand years, the Savans say,
Have crept or flown since that far day
When sandy Heliopolis
First saw that rosy spire arise,
Which now, to pierce the West's wan skies,
Has reached our dim Metropolis.
To no new City of the Sun,
But a big Babel, dark and dun,
Tum's monolith has travelled.
From Nile to Thames! Thought of the things
That stone has seen gives Fancy wings,
And jog-trot brains leaves gravelled.
When JOSEPI ruled, when MOSEs wrought
His miracles, when CÆSAR fought,
And CLEOPATRA revelled,
It stood, and now is here to greet
Stout STANLEY's home-returning feet,
And young grey hairs dishevelled.
From the mysterious Continent
Trophies he brings of years well spent,
In raising growth of laurel ;
With all who'd grudge those well-won bays,
For fevered nights and desperate days,
Punch hereby proclaims quarrel.
The clinging Serpent of old Nile
Upon so true a man might smile;
And Afric's later daughters
Long hence may make his praise their theme,
Who tracked the mighty Congo's stream
Down to the Western waters.
That Continent of Riddles dim,
Yields its long-guarded keys to him,
Her wooer brave and manly.
High up among her heirs of Fame
Just History will write the name
Of staunch “Reporter ” STANLEY..

"FINE FEATHERS MAKE FINE BIRDS.”
(The Faker's Apology.)
"During the present hard times the sellers of birds in the
London streets are sadly put to it to make a few shillings. ...
They make up common birds with bright crests and tails, and
colour them, so that they appear new and most extraordinary
creatures. The process of dressing the bird is called 'faking.'
... These 'faked' birds are so artfully made up that they
might occasionally deceive even connoisseurs in ornithology.
. .. The bird once at home, and thoroughly settled down,
begins to take his bath, and then, of course, the artificial colour
and feathers vanish. In a few hours this valuable South
American singing-bird is transformed into a common greenfinch,
worth three shillings a dozen.”- Daily News.
WELL, yessir, 'tis a hartful way;
But times is 'ard, and gettin' 'arder.
And honesty don't seem the lay
To fill a poor cove's larder.
"Best policy ?” Ah, yes, I'm fly.
Parsons that bait from pulpits dangles.
But ain't there bigger swells as try
A policy of spangles ?
A finch faked out in feathers fine
May draw a bob or two from green 'uns.
But Nobs has fakes as sharp as mine,
And I should say more mean 'uns.
Them chattering daws so smart and fair,
As plumes theirselves in “patriot" feathers,
Ain't the right sort to wash and wear,
And stand all sorts o' weathers.
Beakey 's a showy bird, no doubt,
And one don't rank him 'mongst the silly 'uns ;
But when I fakes a greenfinch out,
My figger ain't Six Millions.
If I fakes crests, why he fakes crowns;
If neither ain't quite worth the money,
To pay him quids and grudge me browns,

A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT.
ACCORDING to newspaper reports,
the celebrated African explorer, Mr.
H. STANLEY, is a total abstainer. If
so, there is one bona fide traveller
who would never claim the b.f.t's Sun-
day privilege. Teetotallers, indeed,
may quote Mr. STANLEY's example
to show that such a traveller can do
without such a privilege on any day
of the week. But that depends on the
requirements of a man's particular
constitution; and the denial of need-
ful refreshment to anybody whom-
soever, whether on a Sunday or a
working day, is doubly unconstitu-
tional.

Shall Europe turn to watch an old man die,
And dress her face in masquerade of woe ?
How much he had outlived! His younger self-
Long since we saw the patriot King-Pope die,
To be entombed with GHIBELLINE and GUELF,
Beside the Love that took his name for cry.
As he outlived that brief term in Love's school,
So he outlived the People's wrath and scorn,
Flight, exile, war; on waves he thought to rule,
Toy of strong currents, hither, thither, borne.
He outlived, too, his weakest, proudest hour,
Which saw the Church around St. Peter's chair
Bowed, by its Bishops, to the awful power
That Heaven's Vicegerent claims o'er souls to bear.
But not outlived that mockery of God
And man alike, which takes a sinner's hand
To wield Right's rule and Truth's divining-rod,
And write itself “ Infallible" in sand.
Outlived the crown forged from the Fisher's ring,
The throne wrought by old wrong from Peter's seat;
Strangest of all, outlived the stalwart king,
Who the “Infallible” had dared defeat.
Happy that one thing he did not outlive,
The charitable soul, the kindly heart,
That rigid dogma's slaves could scarce forgive,
Fearing lest he might play them Balaam's part,
And bless whom he should curse ; and so they drew
Their bonds about him closer, day by day
Living or dying, till no will he knew
But theirs, and as they pointed, marked the way.
Nor yet out-lived the wit that cheered dark days,
Stout heart that stayed him on an up-hill path,
Free hand that still with blessing sowed his ways,
Meekness that humbled pride, and bridled wrath.
A blameless, genial, gentle, good old man !
Not such the hand to Chaos to give form;
Nor, as from cloud to cloud the lightnings ran,
"To ride the whirlwind and direct the storm."
Of God's Vicegerent to assert the claim;
With his “Non-possumus" arrest the tide ;
Free-thought forbid, free press, free speaking blame,
Bind Progress by Church limits to abide.
Task beyond power of man, or Church, or creed ;
Task few more blameless hands have e'er resigned
Than Pio Nono's. Let who will succeed,
Few better, many worse, the world will find.
A Sum in Proportion.
Nor one of the orators who opposed the Vote of Credit brought
forward our old friend,“ the thin end of the wedge.” Yet he
would have been strictly in place. Given £6,000,000 as the thin end
of the wedge, required the money-equivalent of the thick end ?
A CHANGE OF KEYS.
HEINRICH HEINE has said that the keys of this world are at Con-
stantinople, those of the next at Rome. It is a curious coincidence
that on Thursday, February 7th, 1878, both keys changed hands.

as nine out of ten English-
men are-every man with
a head on his shoulders,
and a heart in his body,
must rejoice that Parlia-
ment has been spared a
division on the Vote of
Credit.
Not but what “divi-
sion” on the present
crisis, and its consequences, there is, and must be. In fact, there is just as much foundation
for saying that on the Eastern Question and the issues growing out of it, we have a united
public opinion, as that we have a united Cabinet. To believe those who say so, a man's ears
must be plugged with gun-cotton, and his eyes blinded with the blinkers of party feeling.
Only on one point all patriotic and sensible Englishmen are of one mind—the wish, if it be
in any way possible, not to allow division of opinion in the Cabinet, in Parliament, or the
country, to cripple the action of Government at this crisis. Even those who distrust the
Cabinet, as they cannot displace it, are bound to give it what it asks to put our fighting-gear
into fighting trim. It may,--we all pray it may,-never be necessary to draw the sword. But if sword have, unhappily, to be drawn, it
will be well for England, for Europe, for the world, that it should be sharp and fit for use-blade and handle. It is to the Executive that
the sword is trusted : the Executive is answerable for not drawing it save on compulsion. While Lord DERBY is at the Foreign Office, the
country feels assurance that the sword will not be lightly or needlessly drawn.
Having said this, Punch may say, “Liberavi animam meam ;” and so may the Opposition. They have set forth, in four long nights'
debate, their reasons for distrusting or disagreeing with the Government. They have enforced the fullest explanation of their policy
Government can give. They may think of the Vote as Mr. GLADSTONE, or Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT, or Mr. FORSTER, as Mr. PETER
RYLANDS, or Sir WILFRID LAWSON, or Mr. GRANT DUFF thinks of it. But there an end. They cannot refuse the Government's demand,
while it continues the Government. Being asked for, and the reasons for asking explained, the money must be given.
Therefore Punch rejoices that Mr. FORSTER'S Amendment is withdrawn.

THE LOVELY AND ACCOMPLISHED (BUT EXTREMELY SHORT-SIGHTED) MADAME GELASMA, YIELDING TO THE IMPORTUNITY OF BIR
MANY ADMIRERS, BENDS GRACEFULLY OVER THE PIANO, AND, AFTER STRIKING A FEW CHORDS, WARBLES ONE OF SCAUMANN'S SADDFST
MELODIES IN HER OWN INIMITABLE MANNER. UNFORTUNATELY, HER HOST IS “ ÆSTHETIC,” AND, MORE MINDFUL OF MURAL DECORA-
TION THAN BEAUTIFUL Music, HAS FIXED ONE OF THOSE DELIGHTFUL OLD-FASHIONED ROUND MIRRORS JUST OVER THE PIANO. —

TO SAINT VALENTINE.
Most popular of all the Saints,
Thy rites what churl is hard on?
Thy joys if Punch in rose-hue paints
E'en Puritans will pardon.
Thou art too genial, gentle, gay,
To rouse polemic passions;
Both saints and sinners own thy sway,
That outlives change of fashions.
When ours were known as Isles of Tin,
And modes were “ early British,"
War-paint and woad availed to win
The fair Celt, sly or skittish.
And spite of his all-conquering sword,
And fame as dauntless foeman,
To Love, if to no lesser Lord,
Knocked under the proud Roman.
And still, Saint Valentine, to thee
Rise annual altars laden
With flowers, lace-paper filagree,
And hearts of youth and maiden.
No MARCUS WARD the ancients knew,
Love-letterer of the masses;
Though Roman Rimmels sweetness threw
O'er classic upper classes.
Of Juno-Februata now
St. Valentine the day claims,
Through high and low, Love and his bow,
To England's Empire lay claims.
Though clothes may alter, fashions change
Their cutting, trimming, tissue,
Love hits the mark at longest range,
And in the ring finds issue.
And while to spoon young folks incline,
And summer follows spring-time,
Thy flower-wreathed shrine, St. Valentine,
Shall usher in the ring-time!
MADAME GELASMA, AS SHE APPEARED
SINGING SCHUMANN, TO HER MANY ADMIRERS
STANDING BEHIND!!
The Roman passed, but Love remained
His yoke to lay men's backs on,
And to his chariot enchained
The stubborn Anglo-Saxon:
Nor might the closest coat of mail,
Worn by that wondrous war-man,
From Capid's tiny darts avail
To shield the haughty Norman.
Strange modes of dress in style and shape
Came in with the PLANTAGENET;
But did their wearers' hearts escape?
Not they. Don't you imagine it !
Raptures and rages, tiffs and tears,
Hopes, broken vows-proh pudor!-
Were rife in the tumultuous years,
That history dubs Tudor.
The stirring days of good Queen Bess,
When ruffs were all the fashion,
Experienced rather more than less
Of amorous fret and passion.
'Neath CHARLES and JAMES still raged
Love's flames;
Wigged beaux and belles in patches
Held hands in the same little games
Of sighs, smiles, misses, matches.
And still to Cupid lovers raise
The Ave and the Gloria,
In these our “ Follet-fashioned days"
Of well-beloved VICTORIA.
Unaccountable Oversight.
AMONGʻall the Correspondents who have

With great reputations at pitch and at toss,
And what has that Spirit been saying ?
That Hughenden's Lord has been setting war-snares-
Let us hope that such charges are mere taradiddles ;
But you know, Sir, the Sphinx a high character bears
For puzzling the world with his riddles.
And pray does the Spirit of which you complain
Never utter through lips of immaculate Tories
False charges refuted again and again,
And purely preposterous stories ?
Your imp has made free in the tart P. M. G.,
Where each day sees him cutting the queerest of capers ;
On the rampage has been in the rowdy D. T.,
And their apes in less world-famous papers.
He's an imp of tough hide, through which facts make no
Of a conscience exposure and show-up but harden:
And if Hughenden way he oft makes free to stray,
May he not haunt backstairs at Hawarden ?
Motive-mongers malicious as void of all nous
May welcome the rascally sprite as a brother;
You denounce his vile presence on one side the House,
But how does he look on the other?
I'd not hint upon which side the table he sits,
But it strikes me the imp can be vastly effective
In lending a point to Sir ROBERT's coarse hits,
And sharpening CHAPLIN's invective.
That the Father of Lies is the Father of Whigs
Dr. Johnson maintained. It may sometimes befall so;
But Tories, applauding such champion's digs,
May aspire to that parentage also.

was given to the inmates of the Isle of Wight

“The entertainment evidently afforded much

programme the Rev. J. WENTWORTH ELGER,
Chaplain, moved a vote of thanks to the Chair-

proposal by loud and repeated cheers, and the
Chairman, in acknowledging the vote, stated that
he had brought with him a few presents for the
young and old inmates—an announcement which
was received with almost deafening expressions of
delight by the company."

HERE, THERE, AND EVERYWHERE.
(Why not try it ?)
Quot homines tot sententiæ being still
the order of the day as regards the site of
ERASMUS WILSON's Needle, Mr. Punch
takes the problem in hand, and solves it
thus:-
The Needle will be fixed on a movable
base, to which will be harnessed a team of
traction-engines. By these means it will
be carried, till further notice, through all
the sites in London, gay-on Monday, to
Wormwood Scrubbs; Tuesday, Ely Place,
Holborn ; Wednesday, Scotland Yard;
Thursday, the Isle of Dogs ; Friday,
Pump Court, Temple ; Saturday, the Gar-
den in Ampthill Square; and so on-the
programme of sites being changed weekly,
paying due regard to the interests of
suburban squares and City thoroughfares.
Arrangements will also be made for oc-
casionally laying the Monolith on its side
in the Lowther Arcade, or in some other
convenient and eligible place, where the
public will be permitted to walk all 'over
it in felt slippers, Oxford shoes, Wel-
lingtons, or hob-nailed boots, as the case
may be, under the guidance of a distin-
guished Orientalist, who will attend for the
purpose.
The trifling expense involved in carrying
out the above plan will be borne by a Com-
mittee of the Gentlemen who have hitherto
supplied the published correspondence on
the subject, who will also hold themselves
responsible for such incidental damage to
houses on the lines of route, cellarage, the
gas, water, and other pipes, and destruc-
tion of the roadway, as may arise in the
execution of the project.
Such is Mr. Punch's solution, which,
after carefully reading all that has been
written on the question, he puts forward

A CRY FROM THE “AGONY COLUMN,"
AND THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF.
DAVEN-SPRING.-Gladly would the Raven drink at

heart; but dark clouds have crossed his flight, and doomed him

1 flows, through dark of night, through shine of day.
Bright runs the sparkling water fresh and free. Welcome the
precious drink—there drink and live.
THESE mysterious Advertisements which have lately
excited public curiosity in the second column of the
Times, have at last found their interpretation. They
are evidently a shadowing forth of the inter-aquine
and inter-necine struggle between Manchester and
Thirlmere.
Manchester is well symbolised under the symbol of
that sooty and ugly bird of prey, the Raven. It is
black, and it croaks—so does Manchester. The “pre-
cious fount,” the “living draught," the "sparkling
water fresh and free,” are as evidently Thirlmere.
Gladly would the Raven drink at the precious fount,
but « dark clouds have crossed his flight” – in the
opposition of the Thirlmere Defence Association, and
"doomed him for a time to lose his way"-by the division
on the Second Reading, which sent the Bill to a Hybrid
Committee. Or the dark clouds may be those that issue
from the Mancunian chimneys which ought to consume
their own smoke, and do not-(Look to them. Mr. MAYOR,
and Sir JOSEPH)- and whose all-invading blacks give so
much force and significance to the “Raven” symbol or
simile.
Some have interpreted the “Raven-Spring” to mean
the Irwell; which certainly merits the name by its colour.
On the other hand, the "sparkling water fresh and free,”
which is welcomed as a precious draught, and which we
are called on to "drink, and live,” is palpably inap-
plicable to the sluggish and sable Cocytus, which is
compelled to do the dirty work of the Manchester dis-
trict, a pint of which not the strongest constitution could
resist. “Brief life would be their portion" who should
venture to quaff of Irwell. Still, that is not a reason for
tapping and embanking Thirlmere.

He despatched telegrams to Carpineto (his native

He wrote to all his relations, and named an early day

He went into his bedroom, locked the door, and tried

He took a large sheet of paper, and signed his new

He composed some verses on his election.
He hired a coachman.
He thought a great deal about ANTONELLI.
He resolved to contribute to the Paris Exhibition.
He ordered some note-paper and envelopes with his

He went into his library, and walked round and

He wrote a charming little note to the Quirinal, beg-

A GROAN FROM THE SCHOOL-ROOM.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
THEY write about the “Higher Employment of
Women." Why doesn't somebody, who wants a griev-
ance to get rid of, raise a voice for the " Higher Pay-
ment of Men"-of one unhappy and unfriended class of
men in particular, the Assistant Masters, or, as they
used to be called, “Ushers," i.e., "door-keepers,” of
private Middle-Class schools? While they were door-
keepers their salary might be sufficient for their status.
But now-a-days these quondam "door-keepers” are ex-
pected to be dormitory-keepers at night, policemen in
play-hours, scholars and teachers in school, and gentle-
men at all times. The average salary offered is £40 per
annum, for a round of duties not unfairly stated in the
following actual list of Head-Master's requirements for-
warded to a leading agent for this still legal form of the
slave-trade :-
Duties.
| 1. To sit in school-room and keep order after school-
hours.
2. To see the boys to bed.
3. To keep watch all night, and maintain order in
bed-rooms.
4. To see the boys up in the morning..
5. To be constantly with the boys, and keep order.
6. To teach in school-hours, under direction of Head-
Master, usual English subjects, with Latin, including
CÆSAR, and Greek, including XENOPHON

I know Governesses have a good deal to put up with,
for very poor pay, sometimes. But mine is the case of a
large class of educated young men, whose work is not
over-stated in this schedule, and who are expected, like
the Vicar of GOLDSMITH'S Deserted Village, to consider
themselves "passing rich with forty pounds a year.”
Think of a Butler's or even a Curate's position and pay
in comparison with ours, to say nothing of Housekeepers or
Lady-helps. Of course I do not venture even to suggest
comparison with a skilled Artisan, who has, further, the

the ears of our rulers, and the attention of the country should be distracted by the furious clamour of the newspaper criers, and the
blatant bunkum of the Music-Halls.
When calmness, coolness and command of temper, are more than ever needed to steer H.M.S. Britannia between the Scylla and
Charybdis of National susceptibility and European war, it is deplorable to hear the thoroughgoing partisans of Turkey, and the unscrupulous
assailants of Russia, in Parliament and the Press, raising the cry of “Treason !” against the coolest head in the Cabinet.
Never was such a little game of cross purposes as the spirited Foreign Policy of the Beaconsfield Administration has landed us in.
The organs of the party which out of doors alternates * Rule Britannia," and "We Don't Want to Fight, but by Jingo if We Do,"
with Votes of Confidence in the Government and its policy, are every morning and evening abusing that Government up bill and down
dale, as the basest assemblage of suicidal and self-stultifying incapables that ever sacrificed the interests of a great nation.
The heads of H.M.'s Opposition are 'defending H.M.'s Government from being devoured like Acteon by its own pack. Sir W.
HARCOURT fills three columns of the Times to prove what needs no proof, that the Government avowed its policy of conditional neutrality
before the Atrocities Agitation began; that that policy has been supported by Parliament and public meetings all over the country;
that the Cabinet threw upon Turkey the responsibility of the consequences of its final rejection of the proposals of the Conference; that
Russia, before her army crossed the Balkans, set forth her intentions and objects, and has since simply prosecuted to their natural end
the intentions then foreshadowed ; that England, in May last, set forth the conditions of her neutrality and her interests, which
Russia has hitherto respected ; that the extinction of Turkey in Europe is a fait accompli, which must be accepted ; that England's busi-
ness is not to attempt to set Humpty-Dumpty up again, but to determine who is to take his place.
All this is accomplished fact, or inevitable deduction therefrom.
Not the less there is a lond, angry, and excited party which will not accept accomplished facts, but is determined now that the Turk
is utterly done for with England's consent and connivance, to pitch into the Russians for doing for him, and is clamouring for war
before it knows the conditions of peace, without an avowable object, or an assignable cause more solid than its irritation that Russia
should be big and brawny, aggressive, and given to bounce and brag, and that having got Turkey down, she means to keep her
down, and make an end of her as a European Power in name, she having already ceased to be a European Power in fact, and to set up
in place of her a more capable governing power over the Christian communities she has misgoverned for four hundred years.

Of fume and fret, looks from his steady eyes,

Who can say? Do we get wiser as we
become less foolish, or is our diminishing
folly but a consequence of our increasing
wisdom? Do we take our hat off to the
whirlwind, or is it the whirlwind that takes
our hat off for us, and so saves us that
trouble, at all events ? Alas! these are
life problems that everyone must answer
for himself or for herself according to their
experience. “SWEETIE” of the First
White Guards knew that he had drawn
post-obits on every one of his relations,
and Lord MAZAGON had laconically refused
his last request for an addition to his
income. “Rien de plus, pas un magot,” the
proud old nobleman had replied. For he had
always hated the elder son, and favoured
the younger. SWEETIE could ill afford the
money he had that morning bestowed on
the Little One. Sooner or later he knew
that ruin must come; that one night
harpy-clawed, onion-breathing Hebrews
would tear him from the very midst of a
throng of foreign Princesses with whom he
was flirting, or rush into the smoking-room
of his Club, drag him away from his iced
sherbet and gossamer gossip of town
scandal, and bring him in chains, an exe-
cuted prisoner, to some loathsome dungeon
below the very deepest depths of Hounds-
ditch. He knew this, and smiled. The
languid, devil-may-care training of the
Peeze aller Order never allowed him to be
for an instant-or, at least, for more than
an instant-disturbed.
Yet, though unable to picture to himself
in vivid colours a dégringolade, or to realise
a chute des anges, and though smiling to the
gay throng, and lifting, from time to time,
his plumed helmet in acknowledgment of
some meaning glance, or more than gracious
salute from the many Princesses, Duchesses,
Countesses, and beauties, titled and untitled,
who perfumed the atmosphere of the ad-
miring circle of which he was the centre of
attraction, he was' unable to repress a
certain pang of momentary anxiety for the
future of the bank-notes he had given the

despite his gay bearing, he was most anxious
to meet STRAPMORE.**

approaching when the Public will be tired of permitting
the Companies' only form of break - power to be the
power to break their own carriages, and their servants'
and passengers' bones.
(Commons.)-In answer to questions as to the Con-
ference, the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER said the
Government had agreed in principle to a Congress
(Principle to cover Interests); that it was communi-
cating with other Governments as to the bases (the
question of Capitals having been decided in favour of
Berlin we presume the question of “bases” naturally
comes next on the tapis); that it would be inconvenient
to go minutely into conditions (which are at present "all
in the air'); that each Power would preserve its
liberty to retire at any moment (this freedom of move-
ment being involved in the very etymology of a “Con-
gress," which you walk into, and of course can walk
out of, as opposed to a “Conclave” where you are
locked in); that the minority would not be bound by
the majority (particularly not in Russia binding); that
the Government would maintain its views--(which were
not dissolving-views)—and that every Article of the
Treaty of San Stefano would be submitted to the Con-
gress (these Articles, hitherto indefinite, thanks to
Russian reticence, being laid before the Congress in the
most definite form as Articles de Berlin, seeing that
Articles de Paris are for the moment discredited by the
untoward catastrophe of the Treaties of 1856.) All this
the House cheered very much.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER promised Mem-
bers three weeks' Easter holidays-from April 16 to
May 6-if they would be good boys and work hard.
Adjourned debate on Naval Estimates. The Inflexible
was towed out once again, but to-night rather for a feu de
joie, or salute, from gunnery officers, civilians, admirals,
and amateurs, all bearing testimony in her favour.
After Big Ben's annual funeral chime—“The Navy
is Gone to the Devil,” to the air of “ Down among the
Dead Men," Mr. SMITH quietly resisted Mr. SEELY'S
Motion for a Committee, and gave reasons for believing
that the Inflexible, if not absolutely impregnable and
unsinkable, is yet about the impregnablest and un-
sinkablest of Ironclads ever set afloat.

SOMETHING LIKE A SENTENCE!
(Prom a Possible Law Report.)
CRIMINAL EXCHEQUER COURT.
(Crown Cases Reserved.)
Before the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE in Banco.
The proceedings of this Court, which were of the ordinary cha-
racter, and had been carried on with the usual high death-rate
among all concerned, came to a close yesterday, the only remarkable
incident during the course of the sitting being a somewhat severe
sentence passed in a case of aggravated manslaughter at the close of
the day.
The Jury, who were scarcely able to stand, having returned a
verdict of Guilty, the LORD CHIEF JUSTICE, addressing the prisoner,
said :-
“There is no doubt whatever about your guilt, and as the circum-
stances of the case are of a very heinous character, I have no
hesitation in passing on you the very heaviest sentence which the
law enables me to inflict. You have noticed in the course of this
trial the depressing and asphyxiating effects on mind and body of
the poisonous atmosphere of the Court in which we have all been
condemned to sit; you have seen two boxes of Jurymen carried out on
stretchers, perhaps never to return; you have watched your own
counsel staggering, and at last succumbing on the floor of the Court;
you have heard the Usher cry for water, and listened, I trust not
with unmoved feelings, to my own gasps and groans as I have
struggled to maintain the dignity of the Bench by help of a respi-
rator and a phial of sal volatile. Your crime is, as I have said,
heinous, and I can show you no mercy. Your sentence is that you
be brought up for judgment every day for the space of a whole
calendar month."
The prisoner, who seemed overwhelmed at the announcement, fell
heavily into the arms of two turnkeys, and was removed insensible
-whether from the atmosphere of the Court or the severity of the
sentence did not transpire.

CHAPTER IV.-En Route pour Bohème,
Wo women of dazzling brilliance sat in a carriage,
spectators of SWEETIE's fall,
** Who's that?" asked the Loo-Loo of her
companion the Do-Do, in whose elegant minia-
ture carte de visite, with its red ribands, yellow
reins, and yellow harness, she had come to see
the show. The Loo-Loo was a fresh importa-
tion that season, and had only recently appeared
in The Light Gazelle Ballet on the boards of
the Royal Propriety Theatre.
“Not know him?” returned the more ex-
perienced Do-Do, who began to be already a
trifle jealous of her new friend's undeniable
attractions. “Why, bless you, he's no end of a swell!
Rich as old Water Creases himself, and proud as a Lucifer
that strikes on his own private box," and the riante and
beautiful young tragédienne laughed aloud, as the crowd
echoed her mirth, and, recognising her, gave her a perfect
ovation, aux oeufs et aux chats.
"Quite a reception! Wish there was music, and lime-
lights, and bouquets !” she exclaimed, in high glee, as she threw herself
into one of her best-known attitudes, in which she had been photo-
graphed a thousand times, and sang the first line of one of her most
popular songs. The crowd went into frenzied transports. They thought |
they were having a performance for nothing. But the Do-Do knew
what she was about." It was only an advertisement; for, in another
second, the two neat little Tigers, who were perched up behind, had
descended, and were distributing bills of the Do-Do's Benefit for that day week,
among the crowd.
"Always an eye to business, ma mignonne," she said to the Loo-Loo, as they drove
off at a rapid pace, bowing and smiling to the people, through whose ranks a way
was quickly cleared for her carriage by obsequious policemen.
“But his name? You didn't tell me bis name?" said the Loo-Loo, who was tired
of a performance in which she had played so very second-rate a part.
“His name?" repeated the Do-Do, giving her Maltese toy lapdog a hard slap on
the head for venturing to yawn. “His name? Oh, you mean the big fellow's with
tiddy waist, eh? Well, the man whom he picked up was Pinto PEEZE, of the White
Guards. They call him SWEETIEM"
"Yes, yes, I know that," interrupted her friend, impatiently.
The Do-Do shot a jealous glance at her out of the corner of her beaux yeux daintily outlined with
the best bouchon brûlé that money could procure. “So, Loo-Loo knew SWEETIE, did she ? Very
good,” she thought; but she only answered carelessly, "And the big chap who picked him up, le
géant des géants, is STRAPMORE.”
“ STRAPMORE!” exclaimed the Loo-Loo.“What! not Viscount STRAPMORE, him as were the Lord BUKLYN DE WESCOTT ?"
“Yes. Lui-même ; pas de bêtise. You know him?"
But no answer came from her companion. A perceptible shiver ran through that frail form, her mouth trembled convulsively, and
with a cry that rang through the Palace Yard, and found its echo in the very centre of the gilded saloons of the Aristocratie Aluminium
Club, the fair girl fell fainting on the carriage-rug.
The Household Troops, as the carriage passed along their ranks with its lifeless burden, saluted, and lowered their arms in tender
reverence, and placed their forefingers respectfully to their noses, until it was out of sight.
So thé Do-Do sat by the side of her inanimate friend. The wind blew fiercely in her teeth as they sped onward towards Bohemia;
the dust was in her eyes and hair; the way was long and weary, as she watched for the waking of her unconscious companion, and
burned to question her about STRAPMORE.
“Mystère !" she muttered, between her teeth. “But I will know it." Then she bent forwards towards the coachman.
“Drive,” she hissed in his ear,“ drive to the Cottage where the Swiss people dwell.” The servant touched his cockade. “We are
in Bohemia now," she said to herself, as a smile of triumph played over her upturned features, and a very night-light of vengeance
illumined her almost childish countenance, as it momentarily Aickered in those liquid sorceress-like eyes. “I will see the Gipsy. Cette
fille Bohémienne ! She will be in the tent, or the Cottage ; at all events CARL will tell me where Rosa is to be found. Quick I Quick!”
Thus adjured, the obedient coachman produced a second whip, and urged the thoroughbred Arab, the gift of his Grace the Duke of
BEDOUIN, into a gallop. They were leaving the lamps of the town far behind them, like so many goblin glow-worms in the gloaming,
and the deep, mysterious shadows of night were gathering round them, as they crossed the borders of the dark Wood of St. John,

WITHIN an hour Pinto had come, refreshed, out of his bath of luxurious eau des Carmes, and having been sprinkled all over with
Poudre de Seidlitz, he lay stretched at full length on a luxurious divan in the Albany Aluminium Club, lazily inhaling the fragrant fumes of
a scented cheroot between les petits morceaux d'un gâteau du bain, while he carelessly emptied the boiling thé aux balais de bouleau out

SACRIFICES TO SLANG.
AMONG British Interests one which may
be considered of no small importance is the
interest of the English language. In that
interest really an answer is due to the ques-
tion put as follows in a letter to the Editor
of the Times :-
“Sir, I do not know how it may have struck
your readers, but Mr. FORBES's proposal to call
his reconnoitring force scouts' rather grates
upon my feelings. The proposal itself is excel-
lent; but why not adopt the word 'guides':-
I am yours obediently, H. A.'
Consult your Johnson, H. A., and you
will find the words “scout” and “guide”
respectively defined as follows:-
“Scout, n. 8. (escout, Fr., from escouter). One
who is sent privily to observe the motions of the
enemy.
" GUIDE, n. 8. (guide, Fr., from the verb).
1. One who directs another in his way. 2. One
who directs another in his conduct. 3. Director,
regulator.”
And you will find this further definition
relative to the word "scout":
“To SCOUT, v. n. (from the noun). To go out
in order to observe the motions of an enemy
privately.”
Hence you may discern that “scout” is
exactly the proper appellation for a soldier
on reconnoitring service, and that “guide"
is not. You say that "scout" grates upon
your feelings. Why? Perhaps because
you have heard it used in a dyslogistic
sense as synonymous with “scamp," which
it may have become from being, in Oxford
slang, a name for a usually knavish attend-
ant =“Gyp" at the other University. In
somewhat the same sense an absurd or im-
proper proposal is commonly said to be

Mr. CAILDERS advocated a scheme; the difficulty was
to hit on the right amount of contribution.
Mr. Smita, as in Treasury-Bench-duty bound, urged
the need of caution. It was easy and pleasant to give,
but not so easy to say where to stop giving. But if the
Captain would not press his Amendment, he would
promise to look into the matter, with the strongest
desire to find a way to enable Jack and Joe to make
provision for their widows. When Mr. SMITH makes
such a promise, Punch and the House both believe it
means something, and wait hopefully to see what it will
come to.
Mr. DILLWYN lectured the Treasury on the danger of
turning over unexpended balances from one sub-head
to another; and Mr. O'DONNELL lectured the House,
the Government, and England in general, on the proper
way of dealing with the South African rebellion.
Sir M. HICKS-BEACH poured official cold water on the
glowing eloquence of the Member for Dungarvan. Punch
would rather trust Sir BARTLE FRERE any day than a
glib Irish grievance-monger.
A long sitting on Supply, with lively incidental dis-
cussions of, inter alia, the drainage of Marlborough
House, and the purchase of Clockmill Estate adjoining
Holyrood; the expenditure on public offices, and light-
houses, legal draughtsmen and pauper lunatics; the
cost of Parliamentary reporting, and public prosecu-
tions ; Queen's Colleges in Ireland-attacked by Mr.
O'DONNELL as "a great institution for degrading public
instruction ;” and defended by Mr. PLUNKETT, as having
"educated the Member for Dungaryan." Surely the
€231 voted for medals and prizes at these Colleges is a
cheap payment for that result, were there no other.
Tuesday (Lords).-The Government does not intend

A WEEK of shipwrecks-First of the Eurydice: next, of the hopes
of peace, founded on Lord DERBY's presence in the Cabinet.
Monday, March 25 (Lords),-Lord SALISBURY whitewashed
Mr. OLIPHANT. He had been dismissed from the Secretaryship to
Sir SALAR JUNG-Prime Minister to the Nizam, and Cook Salmo
Salar of Native Statesmen-but he had been dismissed without a
stain on his reputation. When a man has been kicked down-stairs,
it should be a comfort to him to know he has left the best of
obaraoters behind him.
Lord ELPHINSTONE confirmed the sad story of the capsizing of the Eurydice off the Isle of Wight, with three hundred and twenty
souls aboard. Some of Punch's correspondents have had the bad taste to send him puns on the name. He, with a heavy heart,
referriog to his Fourth Georgic, found this Sors Virgiliana singularly applicable-tempestas only substituted for dementia-“storm" for
the “ madness” thereof-
“ Jamque pedem referens, casus evaserat omnes,
“Now, 'scaped her cruise's perils, o'er the foam,
Redditaque Eurydice patrias veniebat ad auras,
Eurydice was gaily bowling home
Quum subita incautam tempestas cepit."
When sudden the equall struck her, off her guard!"
Such a catastrophe falls, like a private grief, on every home and heart in England.

against the Sunday Closing Bill, to which there seems
to have been wholesale forging of signatures, afforded
occasion for Irish recriminations and obstructions, in
which a great deal of precious time was wasted.
The row over the Mutiny Bill wound up the evening
with quite a Donnybrook-Fair flourishing of oratorical
shillelaghs, in which Dr. KENEALY, Mr. O'DONNELL,
Mr. O'CONNOR POWER, and our old friends, Messrs. PAR-
NELL and BIGGAR, handled their bludgeons (of speech)
to their hearts' content, keeping the House at it till
near two in the morning, and goading the chivalrous
but not always patient War-Secretary into a bellicose
mood, and even within an inch of ill-temper.
After this tempest in a tea-cup, there seemed some-
thing like profanity in Mr. SMITH's reading of the QUEEN'S
telegram expressing her grief at the loss of the Eury-
dice and her heartfelt sympathy with the afflicted parents
and relatives of the lost ship's company.
Tuesday (Lords).-The genial Lord HOUGHTON tried
in vain to get Lord BEAUCHAMP's Bishoprics Bill thrown
overboard-apparently from a prejudice against "one
horse” Bishops,“ supported mainly by voluntary contri-
butions,” which may be all very well for hospitals, but not
for Bishops, who ought to be dignified scholars and gen-
tlemen, settled in their sees to enjoy their libraries and
entertain their neighbours, and to employ what may be
left them of leisure from these pleasant occupations in
the secondary business of looking after their dioceses.
The Archbishop of CANTERBURY gave a different view
of episcopal duty, and their Lordships seemed to agree
with Dr. Tart rather than with Lord HOUGHTON.
So the Bill was Read a Second time.
(Commons.)- Another Donnybrook-Fair night over
the Mutiny Bill. This time the fight was over the flog-
ging clauses. But the row was happily cut short by
a count, the Irish combatants not having been careful-
or able-to keep a house.
Wednesday.-The system of Irish-as well as English
and Scotch Municipal Elections, is now under consi-
deration by a Select Committee. So is the Mutiny Bill-

having their say on either ? Perish the thought! So Mr.

WHOLESOME SEVERITY.
(From our own Sporting Time-Keeper.)
THEOxford men, who have been strangely
late this year in showing on the London
water, have at last turned up, and to judge
from their first public performance on
Saturday, their disinclination to put in an
appearance is easily to be accounted for.
We have seldom witnessed a more dis-
graceful exhibition, and from bow, who
appears to be deformed, to stroke, who is a
great bulking and overfleshed specimen of
humanity, there did not seem to us to be a
single oar who ought not to have been
hooted out of the veriest provincial boat-
club.
SMITHSON, of Brasenose [6], struck us as
being a particularly ill-looking lump, his
"reach" being short, his action sprawling,
his slide irregular, and his recovery simply
disgusting. No doubt he is a mere make-
shift, but we should strongly advise those
who are backing the “ dark blue” to have
a thorough understanding on the matter
without further delay.
With regard to PURCELL-BROWN, of
Trinity, who is set down at present for 2,
and BLINKS, of Wadham [5], we should
like to ask both of these “gentlemen "
whether they think they are doing credit
to the colour they wear, or to the Univer-
sity from which they hail, by rolling about
like a couple of porpoises, and so destroy-
ing the last vestige of interest in an event,
on which good honest English money has
been so freely staked ?
As to the rest of the crew, we shall have
a “word to say" to each of them when we
deal with Cambridge, which we hope to do,
fully and fairly, to-morrow. From all ac-
counts, a coal-heaver's horsewhip would

Faith against physic, he said ; ay, and against surgery,
too. The faith that sufficed for the cure of a fever
would be just as equal to setting a broken bone.
(“Hear!") Perhaps mere faith had never yet been
tried in that case, but whenever it was, of course it
would prove no less effectual than in the other. A living
faith would nullify any necessity for operations on live
creatures. To return to HARVEY, he would suggest that
they should endeavour to make him cease to be quoted
as an authority for vivisection. They should take
measures to destroy the influence of his name. Suppose
a prize were offered for the best Essay written with that
view. Its title might be The Unimportance of the
Circulation, or The Discovery of the Circulation of the
Blood of No Use. Perhaps even a reward might be
held out for the clearest demonstration that there was in
fact no truth at all in the theory of the circulation of
the blood-which was his (the Chairman's) own private
opinion. An astronomer named PARALLAX had proved
the earth a flat, and himself too, some said, but satire
was no argument. No doubt the earth was also station-
ary, and so he (the Chairman) suspected was the blood
as well. (Cheers.) A further remuneration ought to be
advertised for a Cartoon of HARVEY dissecting an ago-
nised lapdog, to be copied and posted all over London.
A lot of physicians and surgeons were soliciting sub-
scriptions to a Harvey Tercentenary Memorial Fund, for
erecting a statue to HARVEY at Folkestone, where he
was born on April Fools' Day, 1578, but by far the fittest
testimonial to him would be an Anti-Vivisection poster.

PUNCH’S PROCLAMATION.
Punchius, R.
WHEREAS, by the Reserve (Moral) Force Acts of no
particular date, but of general recognition and universal
application, it is, amongst other things, provided that,
in case of imminent national danger and emergency,
the Reserve Forces of Prudence, Patience, Patriotism,
Justice, Magnanimity, Wise Forethought, and Rational
Self-Restraint, ordinarily latent in the breasts of the
sober, sagacious, and, for the most part, silent portion
of the community, may authoritatively be called out on
active public service:
AND WHEREAS the present state of public affairs and
public opinion, and the necessity in connection there-
with of taking steps for the maintenance of peace, and
for the protection of the real interests, honour, and fair
fame of the Empire, and, especially, of checking the
insurgent forces of Pride, Passion, Prejudice, and
spurious (if well-intentioned) Patriotism, now and for
some time past deplorably and mischievously rampant,
in our opinion, constitute a case of great emergency
within the meaning of the said Acts :
Now, therefore, we do, in pursuance of the said Acts
and of our earnest endeavour for the furtherance of the
Public Weal, hereby direct that forthwith all classes of
the Reserve Forces above specified be called out on per-
manent service, and shall henceforth proceed to and
attend in their places (in Parliament or otherwise), and
at such time or times as may be needful, to serve as
part of Our Army of Moral Militancy until their services
are no longer required.

A CHAIR TO MEND.
WAEN Peace, after due pro and con., was invited
_In Congress's Chair at Berlin to preside,
Her foes were perturbed, but her lovers delighted
Her presidence welcomed with pleasure and pride.
But ere she sat down, to hair-splitting they got 'em,
And two of the disputants, mal à propos,
Kicking over her Chair, put their feet through the bottom, -
A delicate hint for the goddess to go!

To tumble her sword into Justice's scale;
To them Peace's presence, in gentle persona,
Portends that their war-whoops are destined to fail.
But Punch, steady preacher of patriot wisdom,
Whilst wrath heats Society white at each end,
Braves Swelldom, and Mobdom, and Quackdom and Quizdom,
And declares Peace's Chair Wisdom can and should mend.
When Daty sets lips to the clarion of battle,
Or Honour's reveillé wakens War's drum,
Then Valour must arm to the blast and the rattle,
While Peace sadly sighs, stands aloof, and is dumb.
But all except fools with a warm welcome greet her,
At length re-appearing War's horrors to end,
And, regretting the accident, warmly entreat her
To wait while her Chair we take measures to mend.
SCIENTIFIC NOMENCLATURE IN EXCELSIS.
THE grand advantages of scientific description are precision and
accuracy. How perfectly these characteristics are illustrated in
Professor McCoy's description of the head of the Salmon lately
submitted for determination to that learned Professor of Melbourne
University! How the well-known physiognomy of the Salmo salar
rises before the mind's-eye as one reads-
“The preoperculum shows the very constant peculiarity characteristic of
the true Salmon of having its lower limb very long, and making a distinct
(though hlunted) angle with the vertical posterior margin. The nearly
semicircular posterior margin of the gill-cover, composed of the outer edges
of the operculum, suboperculum, and introperculum, is well marked, as in all
| true Salmon, and contrasts strongly with the more rectilinear angulated fora
in the other species of migratory Salmonoids. The very oblique upward an
backward extension of the lower margin of the operculum, making its greates
antero-posterior dimension nearly in the middle of its vertical dimension, is a
good distinction of the Salmon from the allied species. It also presents the
large re-entering angle between the lower end of the operculum and its jun-
tion with the preoperculum, showing a higher exposure of the suboperculum
than in any species except the Salmon, and also shows the very oblique
upward and back werd direction of the suboperculum characteristic of he
Salmon, and contrasting strongly with the Sea Trout and other alled
species,”
It must be borne in mind that the point was to identify thefish
beyond possibility of mistake, as on this head turned the question
whether the true Salmon had' or had not been acclimatisel in
Tasmania. Who after reading this could possibly go wrong?

COMMON SENSE AND CLOTHES.
A CASE of common sense has actually occurred in the
treatment of a question concerning Ecclesiastical vest-
ments. Fact. It has been exhibited by the Vicar and
Churchwardens of St. Michael's, Chester Square. In
the congregation of that Church there is said to be "a
considerable Evangelistic element.” Nevertheless the
Vicar, after notice to his congregation, has taken to
preaching in a surplice, instead of a black gown. This,
as the surplice is the Canonical regulation surtout, was
clearly a rational alteration. Then, a question having
been raised as to the expediency of a similar change of
drapery for the Choristers, the Church wardens had posi-
tively the sense to issue a Circular, calling on the
members of the congregation to fill up a printed form,
stating whether they approved or disapproved of the
proposed raiment. The issue of this uncommonly rea-
sonable proceeding appears in a second Circular, ad-
dressed to the same parties, as follows:--
“The Circular sent out by the Church wardens to all the seat-
holders having resulted in a vote of two to one in favour of a
surpliced choir, the Vicar and Church wardens feel that so deci-
sive a vote should be respected in a matter which can have no
doctrinal significance. It is hoped that the minority will
acquiesce in a change which involves no principle. Surplices
will be adopted on Easter Day. JAMES FLEMING, Vicar;
Dawson GREENE and J. M. HUCKLEBRIDGE, Church wardens."
À Vícar and Church wardens setting an example of
discretion, judgment, fair-dealing, and intelligent ideas
on the subject of vestments, deserve to be enrolled on
Mr. Punch's register of imperishable fame.

Is the Duke of RICHMOND's Medical Bill a bit of superfluous
tinkering about edges and handles, which leaves the hole in the
kettle unstopped ? It looks very like it, from Lord RIPON's hand-
ling of the matter. While the Duke, as representative of the
Medical Council, leaves nineteen examining medical bodies, with
different standards of qualification for England, Ireland, and
Scotland, he can hardly raise the standard of Medical Reform
very triumphantly. The Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians have
told him so in plain terms. Perhaps the Council thinks that in the
multitude of Medical Councillors there is wisdom. And they have
a sensible as well as a sagacious head in Dr. ACLAND, who has earned
his spurs in many a battle for the good cause in medical, educa-
tional, and sanitary war. The utmost the Duke can say is that his
Bill is a step in the right direction. Let us hope it may be. A step

lion's hide, and hang a calf-skin on those recreant limbs," the world
seems to have been very much of Faulconbridge's way of thinking.
All the pluck and chivalry of Austrian arms has not redeemed the
political discredit of METTERNICH's country for shifty policy and
Machiavellian, rather than magnanimous, dealing with friends or
foes. May England never have to lean on Austria for an ally!
(Commons.) The Cape bush-fire does not look like being put out,
or going out. It rather spreads. But there is no truth in reports
of serious disaster to our arms.
As this was the breaking-up night of Miss BRITANNIA's seaside
establishment, there was a natural anxiety to know whether the row
in Dame Europa's school was not likely to come to a flare-up before
the boys at BRITANNIA's school met again. Sir STAFFORD NORTH-
COTE assured Mr. W. E. FORSTER that, speaking generally, nothing
had occurred to give occasion for increased anxiety, or to diminish
the hope of the arrangement of difficulties, which undoubtedly
exist. “Punch wishes he could share Sir STAFFORD's comfortable
assurance,
Sir WILFRID LAWSON objects to so long a holiday as three weeks
in the present emergency, though why there should be an emergency,
except for the obstructive obstinacy of England—“the PARNELL of
Europe"-he could not see.
Mr. COURTNEY could not sufficiently wonder at “the smallness of
the point” on which England and Russia were standing out. One
of the Schoolmen's idle questions used to be, How many angels could
dance on the point of a needle ?" Mr. COURTNEY's wonder is how
two such big beasts as a Lion and a Bear can execute a diplomatic
dance, soon to be changed, perhaps, for a war-dance, on the game
narrow and uncomfortable footing.
Lord R. MONTAGU rebuked Sir WILFRID Lawson and his friends.
The Government would be all the better without the hamper of
Parliament. The Government were in the right. The Government
had Europe at their back.
(What a comfort to feel that such cool, sagacious, experienced
and long-headed politicians as Lord ROBERT, Sir H. D. WOLFF, and
Sir ROBERT PEEL, are so entirely at one with the Government, to
say nothing of the great Jingo out of doors.)
Mr. FAWCETT thought the House had better reassemble on
April 29.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER thought it better, as the
House had met so early, that it should not shorten its holidays, lest
the world should say the masters or the boys were frightened.
Affairs were not blacker than they had been ; there was no reason
to despair of a peaceful settlement.
(All very well, Sir STAFFORD, if you were the man in the cellar.
But there is BEACONSFIELD in the background--and the war-drift
goes on, on,-and Punch does not feel comfortable, and cannot, let
him try never so hard-lean with comfortable assurance on the
policy of Lord BEACONSFIELD, the strength of Lord SALISBURY, the
wisdom of Sir H. D. WOLFF, the coolness of Sir ROBERT PEEL,
the long-sightedness of Lord ROBERT MONTAGU, and the great
sustaining force of Jingo at their backs.)
In the end, the House voted the long holiday till May 6. But
before it separated, it had the rare pleasure-for any lovers of irony
that might have been there-of hearing Mr. O'DONNELL arraign an
article of the Globe for “breach of privilege." Oh, Mr. O'DONNELL
- they say you are a clever man-how could youl You who have
strained privilege so hard! No wonder if there should be a breach
made in it now and then. But is it for you to complain-
“ Clodius accuset meechos ? Catilina Cethegum ?
Quis tulerit Gracchos de seditione querentes ?
Even the Home-Rulerest of the Home-Rulers were ashamed of
him. His motion was silently negatived, and the House passed to
the Previous Question.
In the evening, after an attempt at a Count-Out, the House did a
little deşultory dabbling, with no result, over the Budget Bill, and
then broke up for its Easter holidays—“ with what appetite it may."

And Madame M. Post, that pugnacious Dame DURDEN,
Whose tongue-waggings ever have War for their burden :-
Believe me, most noisy of noisy quartettes,
That your shindy inspires all sane souls with regrets.
Calm patience, dear vixens, is policy's anchor,
Among England's defences you 'll hardly rank rancour.
O'er private opinion Punch claims no dominion ;
Pray soar, if it please you, on spread-eagle pinion ;
But aquiline power of claw or of beak
Is not in proportion to scream and to shriek.

Produce at the best, if you would but believe, a

For your needless indulgence in swagger and shout!

You won't smooth his feathers by dubbing him pirate.
The wise who would compass the highest of aims
Will ne'er waste their vigour in calling bad names.
Dear Dames, do take thought, for this shrewish polemic
Is taking the shape of a bad epidemic.

Acidulous AUSTIN and bellicose BOWLES,

And shriek in a way that might ruffle a saint:
True,-angry old women or hot-headed boys-
They don't count for much, but they make a great noise.
And you, and such a pes of your rowdedow style,
Though helpless to aid, may just manage to rile,
Engendering rows, and establishing raws,
And flinging discredit on e'en the best cause.
Now, do, my dear souls, in this Easter recess,
Take counsel with sense, and with patient address :
Don't howl yourselves hot as PARNELL or O'DONNELL;
Call names, like the fish-fag shut up by O'CONNELL,
Or pander to Jingo's gregarious geese,
By shaking your fists in the face of poor Peace.
You 'll find the old rule still holds good-Idem Semper,

And England would very soon go to-well, Hades,

And, ever and anon, in tones of thunder,

Shamdross, dic., &c.
CHAPTER XIV.-" Ventosus.”
WEETIE rose at his approach.
The five servants, with the candles, stood around.
“Pardon, Messieurs !” said STRAPMORE, and every vein of his fierce,
mad, humour was swollen out, black, and strong, while a sneering smile
played round his parched and fevered lips. Then pointing with frenzied
energy to the opposite wall, he turned SWEETIE's attention in that
direction.
"Regardez-là !" he hissed, in a low, hoarse, rauque tone.
The ruse, though only momentary, succeeded. SWEETIE looked in the
direction indicated, for he had no hesitation in turning his back on one
whom he had, hitherto, deemed his friend. In less than a minute he
discovered his mistake. A jarring sensation shot upwards through his
frame, as, impelled by an irresistible force, he flew forward several yards,
while STRAPMORE, reeling from the herculean effort, fell backwards on
the floor. Then, with a loud report, like that of a masked battery, the
last hidden strings and buckles, by which he was bound, and which had,
till now,.exercised so powerful a control over his actions, yielded, and
snapped asunder, like the breaking purse-
strings of an over-taxed householder, under
this tremendous strain.
As the well disciplined servants lifted
STRAPMOBE to his feet, they silently re-
marked that he was double the man he had
been.
SWEETIE approached him. Even then,
at that supreme moment, he would have
demanded an explanation, and would have
forgiven him. But it was not to be.
STRAPMORE bowed with careless courtesy;
“Messieurs, you are my witnesses that
I- >
But, ere he could utter another word,
SWEETIE'S right hand had darted forth,
with a Titan-like force that would have
burst the bonds that clipped the treasure-
bag of the fabled Elus himself, and, with
the unerring aim of a practical sportsman,
—to whom a bull's-eye in a shop window

youth, and who, when in the country, could

whom bankruptcy has fallen unexpectedly, succumbing, of sheer and sharp necessity, beneath the sudden overpowering force of the
winding-up act.
With a wild-beast howl of stifled rage, the giant frame collapsed in silent agony.
The strong, broad man became feeble, and fabby, as the helpless sail, in the calm that succeeds the fierce tempest. His face was
deadly pale, his voice was hoarse, and gasping, like that of a drowning man, as he muttered to himself, “ Vivre n'est pas respirer,
c'est agir." He slowly ascended the staircase, and, leaning over the balustrade, with one great effort, drew himself up. Then, he
stood erect, as he said, calmly and coldly, “ We will meet."
“Where?”
The word came from SWEETIE's throat, and the voice sounded like a weird imitation of his own by some derisive, mocking, ventriloquist,
who had chosen to represent him as speaking from out of the depths of the deepest wine vault beneath the marble basement.
The servants regarded one another in a half frightened, half curious manner. They had never, before this, witnessed any such
strange, any such thrilling scene, without having paid dearly for their presence, unless, indeed, they had been admitted in obedience
to some authoritative orders.
STRAPMORE replied:
“ Where you will. In London. À L'Arc de Marbre, près des Jardins du Parc d'Hyde. Au coucher du soleil.”
" Soit!"
So they parted.
These two men, who had been boys together at Eton, who had rowed together from Christopher's Clump, in one of Old Brocas's
boats, up to Sarly Island, who had played together at “sixes" in the dear old "Threepenny" corner of the ancient sporting fields, who
had sat together, in the same school, one on the edge of the Fifth Form, the other, close to him, on the edge of the Fourth, side by
side, who had run up a rival score at Tap, Bat, and single wicket, and, in the summer heat, had dived off the Barns on the Bridge,
and had swum about, merrily plashing in the pool below.
STRAPMORE had been little " BUKLYN DE WESTCOTT" then, and PINTO PEEZE was “ PEEZE MAJOR,” but even then he had the sobri-
quet of “SWEETIE.”* And these two were now to meet in 'deadly conflict. And for what? For whom? Could they have foreseen

BRAVO, TORO!
“EUROPE, of course, now smiles upon us, cheers us on, and
prepares, in our eyes, the laurel-wreath which is to reward our
first successes. It would be more to the purpose if we were not
left alone to vindicate treaties, and fight the battle of Europe."
Times.
“BRAVO, Brave Bull!” So swells the foreign chorus,
And grateful such rare plaudits seem to Taur us.
So the Bull swells and sleeks like fondled Cat,
Much relishing the Gaul's applausiye pat,
And flattering titillation of the Teuton,
That both to fight would urge the generous brute on.
Just so a ring of rowdies in the street,
Whene'er at fisticuffs two boobies meet,
Will cheer them on. There's bound to be some fun,
And, probably, good pickings ere all's done.
But, Bull, beware! Tis vastly fine to pose,
As Europe's champion 'gainst Europe's foes;
'Tis very nice to hear the round of praises,
Which, with her tongue in cheek, all Europe raises,
But eré you swallow down the tribute votive,
Perhaps 'twere well to scrutinise its motive.
Jacko, the monkey, can't too much admire
Poor pugs who pulls his chestnuts from the fire ;
But only let Grimalkin burn her paws,
And monkey will to mockery turn applause,
Which of BULL's backers all would care a penny
If, like the immortal cats of famed Kilkenny,
Roused Bull and Bear each other should belabour
Into sheer helplessness, to please a neighbour,
Be't Gaul or Teuton, Áustrian or Turk,
Who all would reap the fruits, the labour shirk ?
Then, verbum sap., dear BULL, If you must fight,
See that it is for honour, safety, right;
For a fair place in Fame's true libro d'oro,
And not mere windy shouts of “Bravo, Toro !”

KEBLE (COLLEGE AND POET).
LINK of College and of Poet
That share the name of KEBLE, —
Say the cynics—and you know it-
Runs a strain which strength calls
feeble.
Something apt to breed impatience
In strong spirits—they maintain-
Both with College aspirations,
And with Poet's sacred strain.
Something flaccid, forced, fantastic,
Something womanish and weak,
In the would-be ways monastic,
In the thoughts these verses speak.
The “plain living” scarce so plain is,
The high thinking "scarce so high,
As the Council's ardent strain is,
As the standards raised imply.
Chapel several shades too showy,
Hall very much too fine;
Piety too o'er-blowy,
Too much gush, and show, and shine.
“In the spirit men you 're training
Of the English Church,” I see.
Pray oblige me by explaining
Where ihat spirit found may be.
Is 't the spirit that is striving,
To lead back stray sheep to Rome ?
Is 't the spirit still contriving
Peace abroad by war at home ?
Is 't the spirit whose best wish is,
Science sinfulness to show ?
Spirit set on loaves and fishes ?
Spirit Broad, or High, or Low ?
In our Church-is't praise or pity ?
For each head we find a cap;
To its cordials it will fit ye
Spirits drawn from every tap.
Then what wonder KEBLE's issue
Is something undefined,
Neither tough old Oxford tissue,
Nor daring modern mind :
Half withdrawn in ways ascetic,
Half with modern potions stirring;
Half athlete, half asthetic-
“Neither fish, flesh, nor red-berring."

"I... dye!” she sbrieked.
“You do--and you shall !” he cried with his horrid,
demoniac laughter; while the Gipsy, from behind the
bed-curtains, yelled aloud, in her low Tzlang dialect,
" Itterard!'sh'aint gotno phrenz!"
Escaping for a moment from STRAPMORE, she threw
open wide the window. A crushed and shapeless, but
still a living, breathing, flopping mass, she fell against
the sill-half out, half within. He had not come unpre-
pared for this attempt. Seizing a cudgel, and holding
it in both arms, crossways, he rapped the side of the win-
dow sharply, sang a few bars of a wild, vindictive air,
repeated the three blows on the window-Bill, as though
sharpening the weapon for vengeance, and then aimed,
with it, at her head. Adroitly, and with the cunning of a
serpent, she foiled him each time he tried to hit her,
80 quickly moving her head, that the stick descended
with a heavy thud on the window-sill. Then STRAP-
MORE paused for a second in his work, and in a harsh,
rauque, cruel voice, cried, “You thought to make me
rue! You shall rue, too, oh rue too too ! rue too too !!”
And once more the stick descended, and once more she
avoided the blow. A crowd had gathered in front: he
waited for the blow of his revenge to fall in the sight of
the assembled multitude. Suddenly, a man below gave
the alarm by beating a drum, and blowing on some reed-
pipes.
Then with one last look at that helpless, nerveless
form, STRAPMORE, for disguise, turned into the next
street, and fled. He was hotly pursued. His bulk and
weight told against him. His agile slimness had gone.
On! On!
Into a house, up the stairs, on to the roof, thence he
would seek safety in flight. “Alas !” he murmured
hoarsely, “I cannot fly.”
"Like a bird,” whispered a low voice in his ear. It
was TIPITI WITCHEETA, the Gipsy. “Come!”
He followed her, quite like an ordinary being, as a
man follows another who goes first, for he was broken in
heart and spirit. She took him to their caravan in a

What a pregnant chapter is here suggested for the Seer of Chelsea !
It is almost worth the while of True Thomas to shake off the torpor
of age, and add another chapter to Sartor Resartus, of “Clothes in

MUSIC IN THE MASKELYNE STYLE.
Mr. MASKELYNE has already produced a mechanical whist-player
who can beat most members of the Arlington, and a mechanical
draughtsman, who could give points to " Ape" or "Spy." He has
now gone several wheels further, and produces a mechanical musi-
cian. Fanfare, the latest rival, or shall we not rather say, com-

artists are not jealous of each other-is, we are informed, the first
automaton that has ever blown its own trampet. Another distinc-
tion of the mechanical from the human artist. But bas Mr. Mas-
KELYNE duly weighed the consequence of introducing this seductive
practice into the automatic world ? If all his automata take to
blowing their own trumpets, he will soon find himself more and
more in the predicament of miserable managers of human per-
formers.

Lord and Lady MAZAGON are rich, prosperous, and
happy. They have never less than eight Bishops to
dine with them, and Archdeacons come in to tea. Some-
times Lord MAZAGON observes to his wife as they drive
past the Arch of Marble, “Poor PINTO! what a fool he
was !” and Miladi, who never differs from him, admits
the justice of the observation. The Do-Do set up a
large millinery establishment, and rapidly acquired a
fortune under Lady MAZAGON's patronage. The busi-
ness has recently been extended to perfumery and

Lord NUFFINMORE, on his wife's disappearance, took

repartees. Ultimately he was shelved by the Govern-
ment, and in this condition he was found some years
afterwards. He was subsequently buried and forgotten.

Music-Hall and Casino in years gone by had been well known to the
police. Mr. MELTER Moss had a very kind heart, and never allowed
any of his guests to depart until they had had a good sleep under
the tables, and were quite sober.
The CHAIRMAN interrupted the learned Serjeant to inform him
that the Bench had unanimously agreed to grant Mr. MELTER Moss
his licence.

MEPHISTOPHELES AND MARGARET.
Ar Hawarden the other day, when the delegates from the
Manchester Liberal Conference and the Welsh Liberals waited on
Mr. GLADSTONE,
"One of the speakers was Mr. WILLIAM MATHER (Salford), who in the
course of his speech asked Mr. GLADSTONE to come forward to help them
rescue the QUEEN, 'a guileless Lady in the hands of that fearful Mephis-
topheles.'
This fearful Mephistopheles is, of course, Lord BEACONSFIELD.
Her Majesty Queen VICTORIA must be implied to occupy the posi-
tion of Gretchen, But that won't do-for where the dickens is
Doctor Faustus?
"Another speaker, Mr. WILLIAM CROSFIELD (Warrington), alluded to
Lord BEACONSFIELD as a wolf in sheep's clothing."
Comparisons may be odious, but correct for all that. “Mephis-
topheles," and "wolf," though hard names, are intelligible, whether
merited or no. But what is the “sheep's clothing"? Lord
BEACONSFIELD may go clad in his Premier's uniform or in the robes
of a Peer, but neither one nor the other can be regarded as the
emblematic vesture of innocence. Let us hope, however, that the
preservation of peace will confute the cry of wolf, and that at least
the Prime Ministerial Mephistopheles will not prove so black as he
is painted.

course. Well, it works, well-very well!!"
And then the poor worn-out voice grew
husky, and human nature, struggling with
the strain that was this once to prove too
much for her, gave way.
The proudest Peer in the House, the
gallant, light-hearted Marquis of S-L-8-
B-R-Y stood here in the dark, at the foot
of Westminster Bridge, and wept like a
little child.
The Author of Tancred was not the man
to deal roughly with an outburst of emo-
tion, however ill-timed. Though the
impatient beating of his foot upon the
pavement showed that he was annoyed at
the interruption, he let it take its course.
“He is a little over-taxed,” he said,
thoughtfully. “This Government of two,
of which he alone discharges the duties of
the entire Executive, is beginning to tell
upon him ;" and he was about to address a
few kindly words of encouragement to the
now calmer Marquis, when the latter spoke.
“This is my day's work,” he said,
brightening visibly, as he pulled a pen-
cilled list from his waistcoat-pocket.
"Shall I read it to you ?" His companion
gave a slight nod. He went on.
“The rest of the Cabinet have been
seized and placed in honorary confinement
in Rosherville Gardens.”
A slow glimmer of satisfaction half kin-
dled the eyes of the listening Earl. “Good!”
he cried ;“ very good! When we have to
govern a great country without a Parlia-
ment we can't mince matters, eh? Go
on, my Lord, go on! Rosherville Gar-
dens! Very good! Go on!"
The night wind wailed through the
grand old constitutional battlements above,
and then the voice of the Marquis seemed
to sink to a deeper note as he continued,
"We have to govern without a Parlia-
ment, and — without supplies !!! There
was a slight irony in his voice now,
but he resumed - "That obstacle, how-

“There will be money for the troops-

Earl with an enthusiastic laugh. “Ha!

then, with a sweet strong voice, and perfect Ethiopian accent, he
cried, “Ole Jog, kickin' up abind and afore."
In an instant the rifle dropped, and on the fresh morning air was
borne the countersign, “Pass, Ole JOE. All well! Yah! yah!”
Exchanging a smile of satisfaction, the two Statesmen proceeded on
their way towards Charing Cross,
"The Caffres have quite astonished Windsor, I hear,” said the
Marquis, gaining courage, as they neared the statue of CHARLES THE
FIRST. "Certainly the 'importation of the Empire' was a fine card
to play."
"It was,” rejoined his chief, gazing, proudly up at NELSON'S
cocked hat; “but it was nothing to playing the Prerogative."
BEAUTIES AND BELLES.

said :
"My friend sitting on my
right has complained to me that
the ships of the present day are
unpaintable. That is no doubt
to be regretted, but the sailor
always conceives that to be a
beautiful ship which is capable
of doing its duty thoroughly, and

Muslin-clads, all of them if
they would only think 80,
No marvel she looked passé, peevish, pale,
Unlovely, languid, and with doldrums laden.
To cheer her praise of knights might not avail,
Nor chaunt of moon-eyed maiden.
Laus Veneris ! they sang; the music rose
_More like a requiem than a gladsome pæan.
With sullen lip and earth-averted nose
Listened the Cytherean.
This Aphrodite? Then methought I heard
Loud laughter of the Queen of Love, full scornful
Of this dull simulacrum, strained, absurd,
Green-sick, and mutely mournful.
A solid Payche and a podgy Pan,
A pulpy Cupid crying on a column,
A skew-limbed Luna, a Peona wan,
A Man and Mischief solemn;
A moonlight-coloured maiden-she was hight
Ophelia, but poor Hamlet would have frightened
A wondrous creature called the Shulamite,
With vesture quaintly tightened';
These and such other phantasms seemed to fill
Those silk-hung vistas, which, though fair and roomy,
Nathless seemed straitened, close, oppressive, still,
And gogglesome and gloomy.
For over all there hung a glamour queer,
A sense of something odd the spirit daunted ;
And said, like a witch-whisper in the ear,
“The place is haunted !"
III.
And there were creatures, nondescript, half-nude,
With flesh and raiment of amazing colours ;
With strange and spectral life they seemed endued,
A prey to nameless dolours.
Carven from teak, hewn out of malachite,
Of moonshine some, and some of cheese half-rotten,
Their forms appeared, oppressive to the sight,
Monstrous and misbegotten.
And when they stood, they ever stood askew,.
And if perchance they walked they always hobbled,
Limbs had they that like twisted thorn-trunks grew,
And heads which wagged and wobbled.
They hung all huddled in the dim inane,
Helpless as the three legs on a Manx penny,
Tangled in snaky scarves, as vesture vain,
Or else they wore not any.
" What, what are these monstrosities ?” I cried.
“Chimeras worse than aught in ancient stories!"
Then, in reproof, a solemn voice replied,
“These things are allegories!”
A Time (of teak), a Death (of mouldy cheese);
Day, standing cramped and dismal in a doorway;
Spring, lolling limply, hopeless, ill at ease;
And Summer, chill as Norway!
I could no more ; I veiled my wearied eyes.
I said, “Is this indeed the High Ideal ?
If so, give me plain faces, common skies,
The homely and the real.”
But no, this limbo is not that fair land.
Beloved of soaring fancies, hearts ecstatio;
'Tis the Fools' Paradise of a small band,
Queer, crude, absurd, erratic.
I turned, and murmured, as I passed away,
_“ Such limbos of mimetic immaturity
Have no abiding hold e'en on to-day,.
Of fame no calm security.”
For over all there hung a glamour queer,
A sense of something odd the spirit daunted,
And said, like a witch-whisper in the ear,
“This place is haunted !"

THE HAUNTED LIMBO.
A May-Night Vision, after a Visit to the Grosvenor Gallery,
(With acknowledgment of a hint from Hood.)
A WORLD of whim I wandered in of late,
A limbo all unknown to common mortals ;
But in the drear night-watches 'twas my fate
To pass within its portals,
Dusk warders, dim and drowsy, drew aside
What seemed a shadowy unsubstantial curtain,
And pointed onwards as with pain or pride,
But which appeared uncertain.
I entered, and an opiate influence stole,
Like semi-palsy, over thought and feeling,
And with inebriate haziness my soul
Seemed rapt almost to reeling.
For over all there hung a glamour queer,
A sense of something odd the spirit daunted,
And said, like a witch-whisper in the ear,
“The place is haunted !"
II.
Those women, ah, those women! They were whito,
Blue, green, and grey,-all hues, save those of nature,
Bony of frame, and dim and dull of sight,
And parlous tall of stature.
Ars longa est,-aye, very long indeed,
And long as Art were all these High-Art ladies,
And wan, and weird ; one might suppose the breed
A cross 'twixt earth and Hades.
If poor Persephone to the Dark King
Had children borne, after that rape from Enna,
Much so might they have looked, when suffering
From too much salts and senna.
Many their guises, but no various grace
Or changeful charm relieved their sombre sameness;
Of form contorted, and cadaverous face,
And limp lopsided lameness.
Venus was there ; at least, they called her so:
A pallid person with a jaw protrusive,
Who palpably had found all passion slow,
And all delight delusive.
Plates before Pictures.
THE LORD MAYOR, on a recent appropriate occasion, took the
opportunity to call attention to the absence of Pictorial Art from
the Mansion House. The want of paintings at the Civic Palace has
doubtless remained unnoticed because the attention of every-
I body there has been exclusively devoted to the plates.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
“The above ADVERTISEMENT is inserted by the SOCIETY for the TOTAL
ABOLITION and UTTER SUPPRESSION of VIVISECTION."
What then, Sir, does the body professing itself a Society for the
Abolition and Sappression of Vivisection, in depreciating HARVEY,
mean to do him honour, like the deliverer of the address to the Anti-
physiological Society which you reported ? By saying that HARVEY
did not discover the circulation of the blood, do the Antivivisection-
ists really intend to say that he did ? If so, then, the former and the
latter are both equally ironical. In the same spirit those ironical
adversaries of Vivisection, I suppose, would contend that Sir CHARLES
BELL was not the discoverer of the connection of the motor nerves
with the fore, and the sensitive nerves with the hinder, divisions of
the spinal cord. This, then, would be irony too. Sir CHABLES
BELL's discovery, also, was effected through experiments on living
animals, performed, as no doubt were HARVEY's too, as humanely
as possible. The Antivivisectionists who disparage HARVEY, and
would likewise, in consistency, decry BELL, vilifying both ironically,
have also, I suppose, adopted a title which, representing them as
aiming to put down Vivisection, is ironical as well. They would
have us understand that their object is to promote that practice and
not to prevent it; and the pretence of the latter design is only their
irony. In short, they detract from the fame of HARVEY-of whose
profession I have the honour to be a humble Member — only to
extol him; just as you, perhaps, by way of an intended compliment,
might call me an ass. But that sort of irony-indeed all irony
whatever-is open to misconstruction, and, preferring the naked

ost eventful week of the Session. First,
the great Gladiatorial game in Lords and
Commons. Then the return from St.
Petersburg to Chesham Place of the
Russian Eagle, dark, two-headed, double-
clawed, bearing in either talon peace or
war-who shall say which to offer, which
to have taken 2-8 week big, it may be,
with issues greater even than peace or
war; a week that our children, and
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren,
to many a generation yet unborn, may
have reason to look back on.
Place aux Pairs!
First, in the Lords' Lists (Monday,
May 20), rode the courteous Baron of
SELBORNE, and touched the shield of that
good knight, my Lord of CAIRNS; and
then-to describe the encounter à la
Laureate :-
For four long hours, opposed within the liste,
They charged and clashed and countered,
locked in steel;
Defying each the other's point and edge;
Each impotent to shake the other's seat:
So that all they that watched about the lists,
Still looking to see either hurled to hurt,
Still seeing each erect and debonair,
Delivering their staves, at each new course,
Feateous and fair as first, said, murmuring,
“ This is no fight à outrance, but a trick
Of tourney, where these Lords but show
their skill;
Not level lance, as in grave cause and great,
St. George to aid, and God to guard the right."
So it was, that in Monday's encounter of lordly legal wits and weights, between
Chancellor that was and Chancellor that is, to the lay mind the upshot is utter
bewilderment on which side went the best of the battle-my Lord SELBORNE CON-
tending, with admirable force, that a grave breach of the Constitution and of the
Law had been committed in moving Indian troops to Malta without the consent of
Parliament, Lord CAIRNS arguing, with plausible law and potent logic, that neither
the Constitution nor the Law had been trenched upon one whit. One maintains
SP.Mesne
that the Bill of Rights and the Mutiny Act have in effect been broken through; the
other, that neither applies to the case.
The utmost, says my Lord CAIRNS, that Government has done has been to go to the Indian Treasury for the first cost of moving the
Indian troops, till they can ask Parliament to repay the money out of Imperial revenues. That repayment asked for and granted, they
are in order with the letter of the Law as they are already with its spirit. The great point at issue-has Lord BEACONSFIELD violated, or,
if not violated, strained the Constitution, by giving Parliament the go-by where the Common Law of England, as declared in the Bill of
Rights, says the consent of Parliament must be asked and obtained ?-remains, as far as the light of the great legal luminaries of the Lords
goes, exactly where it was. Lord SELBORNE says “ Yes," Lord CAIRNS says "No." Each gives reasons for his view that appear to the
lay-mind conclusive till the other has given his reasons for the opposite conclusion.
Such was the upshot of Monday's debate in the Lords. Only two notable incidents mark it, besides this resultless clash of legal
swords. One is, the defection of one of the staunchest of Conservative Dukes-RUTLAND-from his Leader, whom he charges with
having put a grave slight, and committed a great encroachment, upon Parliament. The other is, the wholesome counsel administered
to Her Majesty's Opposition by the Head of Her Majesty's Government. ("Fas est et ab hoste doceri.”) Let the Leaders of Opposition
lay to heart this lesson of the Leader of the Crown, the Cabinet, the Majority, -and the Jingoes.
“If the noble and learned Lord who introduced this question believed that we have acted contrary to the Constitution, he ought to act up to his bold
phrases, and come forward declaring his belief that our action was unconstitutional, and that it was his duty to ask the opinion of Parliament upon it.
The noble Earl who spoke last said he did not do that because he did not like to be in a minority. But you will never be in a majority if your nerves are
80 delicate. (Laughter.) You must assert your opinions without fear, and if they are just and true and right, you will ultimately be supported by the
country.”
Put that in your pipes, my Lords GRANVILLE and HARTINGTON, and smoke it, and swallow the smoke.
Lord BEACONSFIELD laughed the Opposition's law to scorn, and would wait to defend his policy till he thought proper.
(Commons.)-Here, too, the same combat was going on, but not with quite the same air of mere tilting with blunt lances.
My Lord HARTINGTON and the good knight Sir MICHAEL-HICKS BEACH at least met point to point, Amendment to Resolution.
Both should be of the Essence of Parliament, if there is to be virtue in that extract for times to come. Here is Lord HARTINGTON'S
Resolution :-
“That, by the Constitution of this Realm, no forces may be raised or kept by the Crown in time of peace without the consent of Parliament within
any part of the dominions of the Crown, excepting only such forces as may be actually serving within Her Majesty's Indian possessions."
Here is the Colonial Secretary's Amendment:-
“That, as the control of Parliament over the military forces of the Crown is sufficiently secured by law and the power of refusing supplies, it is
inexpedient to pass a Resolution weakening the hands of the Government in the present state of Foreiga Affairs."
To-night the tilters were the two movers, Sir CHARLES DILKE, Messrs. DILLWYN, McIVER, and Captain RICHIE,-in the mauvais
quart d'heure, when Members are dining instead of debating, or dosing over debate,-then Mr. LAING and Mr. CHAPLIN, Sir W.

MIDDLESEX MAGISTRATES GOING TO THE DERBY.
The grey looks fit at last ; true sportsmen pray
This likely looking horse may win the day.
Ben keeps his counsel. Sepoy strips. “Friend BEN,"
Says Punch,-good judge of horses as of men,
“The nag is smart, but can he stay the course ?
Don't think he looks quite like a Derby horse.
Is it with him that you declare to win ?"
'Cute Ben replies, with such a curious grin
One knows not if he's serious or funning,
“That's telling-but at least he'll force the running!"
THE DARK HORSE.
A DARK Horse, limbs fine, tail high, nostrils wide, -
As yet on English turf unknown, untried.
But Ben, the veteran trainer, close and 'cute,
Appeared to have a fancy for the brute-
“ Appeared,”—for Ben is hard to understand,
And rayther given to hide, than show his hand.
There never was a Dark 'Un more discussed
Than this game Sepoy, out of India, by
Imperial Policy.
Tipsters have squabbled, quidauncs fumed and fussed.
The hopes of some on his career seemed centred ;
“He'll never run," said others, “though he's entered.”
“ Don't like these foreiga strains," old turfites cried;.
“Right British Sportsmen would not run such cattle.”
Others were sweet upon his style and stride,
And boldly bucked him for the equine battle.

sume held the Sepoy as a “second string."
The real interest of the Ring
Having been centered in a mighty grey
Called Congress, shaped to go, some think to stay,
But somewhat backward in his preparation,
Owing, 'twas said, to leary BEN's own blundering,
Whether o'er-cleverness or vacillation
None knew, the trainer loved to keep men wondering,
And a good Dark 'Un was his great delight;
Long odds be ever liked to be upsetting,
So, spite of opposition far and wide,
The public backed the Great Untried,
And Sepoy kept a front place in the betting.
But as the day of the great race drew near,
'Twas found, with mingled joy and fear,
That Congress came again with a great rush.
The swells and cads, the touts and tipsters crush
To take stock of the favourite once more,
Still clothed and hooded, but legs right, all four.
RIGHT AND WRONG WHALES.
Smith's Sound, lat. 82° N.
MR. PUNCH,
BIR, I am astonished at some people's impudence-Mr.
FARINI'S especially. I learn from a friendly porpoise who has
lately been making a run up the Thames with a family party, that
after placarding London streets with “The Whale's Coming ” he
has dared to announce the arrival of one of our family in the West-
minster Aquarium. He has got his friends in the newspapers to
make a mighty fuss about its capture off Labrador, where, we are
solemnly informed-
"That a constant supply of these monsters of the deep' may be readily
obtained for the future, Mr. FARINI has, through his agents, secured the
exclusive right of the Whale fishery off a large portion of the Labrador coast.
and purchased an enclosed bay, serving as a kind of Whale preserve.'"
Will you believe me, Sir, when I assure you that the new arrival so
pompously heralded is not a member of the Whale family at all, but
belongs to another and very different branch of the Cetacean family
-the Dolphins-is a Beluga, in fact, not a Balena.
He may be “very like a whale," but a Whale he is not. His
coloar, size, the position of his blow-holes, all give the lie to his
claim to rank with,

John, Earl Russell.
BORN, AUGUST 18, 1792.
DIED, MAY 28, 1878.
Hill,
The Golden Wedding, but three weeks ago,
Of him and Liberty, his mistress dear!
And now the true old heart, which then beat slow,
Is stopped, and England bows beside his bier,
Remembering the brave work of that long life
Which saw the light, when France, in Mænad mood,
Mad with the shock of old and new at strife,
Strove to give Liberty fresh youth by blood;
Rousing a horror, that from those who wrought
Such deeds in Liberty's most sacred Dame
Had spread to Liberty herself, till thought
Of her grew hateful, and men spurned her claim.
But he was of the few of firmer heart,
Who kept the Goddess and the godless throng
Of her blood-drunken worshippers a part,
Held her truths fast, and did her shrine no wrong.
For they had drawn tbeir faith from purer springs,
Where Liberty sat side by side with Law,
O'erbearing howl of Mobs and hest of Kings,
With Order for their guide who came to draw.
So, from the first day of his public life
Unto the last-some sixty years and more-
As Liberty's liege knight he served, in strife
Of good with ill, whate'er name either bore.
Content to wait, but still with trust to win,
In God's fight, for God's cause--the good of man:
Oft baffled, but with heart to re-begin
To-morrow what to-day's strength failed to span.
Whatever victory stands writ in light
O'er crime, hate, ignorance, fair claim denied,
O'er Wrong usurping arms and place of Right-
His name is written at that conquest's side.
Others might change their colours and their cause,
Some, whose weak eyes slow opened to the light,
Some, who in fear of progress prayed for pause;
His road was ever on, from right to right.
The faiths his youth had held when held by few,
He lived to see the faiths of most and best,
Till in their wake the common herd they drew,
And shaped the law, and stood for truths confest.
Rare fortune! It was given his age to see
The fulness of the day whose dawn he saw,
The harvests garnered, at whose sowing he
Had heard the seed proclaimed not worth a straw.
No wonder if, with all he had done and known,
He held him somewhat stifly, in the trust
That where he showed the way 'twas wisely shown-
That all his “would-bes," would ; his “must-bes,"
must.
They called him cold and proud who judged by shows.
Not knowing what a fire was at his core,
What springs of love 'neath that hard surface rose,
What flowers that seeming sand-waste bred and

ART NOTES.
OUR Bank of Elegance notes are not in high credit. But our Bank of
Arts notes ought to be, when the bank is HENRY BLACKBURN'S & Co., and the
notes are his Grosvenor Gallery Notes, and his Academy Notes for 1878. Never
were more unmistakeable cases of " value received," than theirs who purchase
these two wonderful shillingsworths—the best aids to memory, for the collec-
tions they relate to, that have ever been produced. The illustrations, excellent
records of the pictures, in many cases from sketches by the painters, are full
of spirit, and, for their scale, wonderfully effective; the remarks terse, and to
the point.
After Punch's Own Guide to the Academy and the Grosvenor, the best,
he has no hesitation in saying, are Mr. BLACKBURN'S.
Mr. COMYNS CARR's Illustrated Catalogue of the Grosvenor Gallery Exhibi-
tion of Drawings last year, with his admirable introduction and careful photo-
graphic illustrations, is to these popular little productions of Mr. BLACKBURN'S
as a hundred-pound note to a shinplaster. It costs a guinea, and is worth a
great deal more. But though more elaborate and exquisite alike in its text
and its illustrations, it appeals to a smaller public, as the hundred-pound note
does-worse luck! Still it should not be passed over, for that reason, in any
notice of recently issued Art-Currency.

Porte it Isn't.

“The Porte- that is the building which from its gateway was so called, and in which
the Government Offices and Archives of the Ottoman Empire were housed-has been
burnt, whether by the act of an incendiary is not yet known.”—Constantinople Letter,
May 25th.
'Twas once strong military Porte,
Then Porte in a storm, not a doubt of it;
Lastly, Porte in blue blazes, and now
Porte with all the spirit burnt out of it.
Only when sorrow came his hearth to share
With sadness love and reverence could not cheer,
'Twas seen how pride could bow, how faith could bear
And trust in God make even darkness clear.
He lived to see the fifty years complete
From his first battle won in Freedom's cause ;
Like one that hears, 'twixt sleep and waking sweet,
The songs that tell of May-time in the shaws,
He heard their greetings whom he might not see,
Nor take their hands, nor thank them face to face;
And then the long-tried spirit was set free,
And England bows above his resting-place !

If the Congress wants to have the pleasure of Greece's

words, “Let Greece wait till she 's asked."
Mr. BOURKE, to the great satisfaction of the House,
gave a good report of the progress of stout old Kaiser
WILHELM.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER thinks that our
feeling of horror at the attempt, and thankfulness for
the Emperor's escape, has been sufficiently expressed.
So does Punch. The SECRETARY of STATE has already,
in the name of the country, forwarded an address of
congratulation and condolence to the German Govern-
ment. We trust be will always speak as completely in
the sense of JOHN BOLL as on this occasion.
Has not the House a CHAPLIN, as well as a Chaplain ?
The one is not more naturally employed in reading
prayers, than the other in moving the adjournment of
the House over the Derby Day. Our only regret is that
the Member for Mid-Lincolnshire had nothing in the
race. Punch makes him a present of a name for the
next nag he may enter for the Blue Riband-Jingo.
Mr. CHAPLIN gave the House a "tip "-we are sorry
to say like other of his “tips," a wrong one-Sir
Joseph. Let us hope Honourable Members did not put
on their money after their own prophet to their own
loss.
Mr. R. POWER seconded the Motion. We need not
wish "more power” to him, for he was very pleasant.
If only Irish Members would follow their natural
bent, and be usually as amusing as Mr. R. POWER was
on Tuesday!
Even Mr. BIGGAR announced his intention of voting
for the adjournment, for the characteristio reason, that
he believed horse-racing, 80 far from improving the
breed of horses, had a contrary effect.
Mr. ASSHETON opposed the Motion.
“No one grudged the House a holiday less than he did ; but
they were going to take their holidays very soon. Those who
kept the officials of that House, not from twelve to six o'clock
on a Wednesday afternoon, but up all night, to discuss at what

I hold them big shams, and I'm vastly inclined
To fanoy BRITANNIA is much of my mind.
It is costly to keep them, whilo keep them one oan,
And plaguy to lose them, with many a man :
And BRITANNIA would see, were sho wise,- which she's not, -
That by far the best plan's to get rid of the lot!
Opposition not Obstruction.
THE SPEAKER judioiously distinguishes between the opposition of
small minorities to cortain Bills, as in the case of the Irish Sunday
Closing Bill, and more obstruotion for obstruction's sake to despatch
of business. The rule by which fair may be distinguished from
vexatious opposition sooms simple enough. The opposition is fair
when the Bill opposed is vexatious. .
NEPTUNE'S NOTION.
ONE more of my Sea-Rams gone down like a shot!
A plague on the ugly and lubberly lot!
More trouble they give than whole legions of Tritons,
Till the prospect my godship prodigiously frightens,
Ah, Vuloan, you played me the scarviest joko
When you placed these leviathans under my yoke!
The Iron God's brood upon land may look fine,
But, by Thetis, they seem all abroad on the brine.
They can't keep afloat without infinite bother,
Or even keep out of the way of each other,
But either go in for spontaneous sinking,
Or all set a-butting each other like winking I..
A fine guard of honour for Neptune in sooth !
I would rather go back to the ways of my youth,
Ere hulking Hephæstus had furnished my ranks
With assistants I wish I'd declined without thanks.
Rams! Rubbish! The name's a mionomer, no more;
Rival Rams, in their combats à outrance ashore
Butt bravely in bellicose fury no doubt,
Until one of the two gets the best of the bout;
But the harder they drive, in their impetus rash,
The more the hard-headed brutes' skuils won't go smash;
But my Sea-Rams, it seems, may by accident quite
Disable each other for serious fight,
And butter and butted alike go to pot,
In a style which if I understand I'll be shot.
One end it would seem waits the whole lot, and that's
The fate which befel the famed Kilkenny Cats!
The Monsters! they multiply faster and faster,
But the whole of their record is one of disaster.

THIRLMERE.
DEEP sunk amid the silent hills,
Fed by a hundred mountain rills,
It lies asleep.
The cattle roam along its brink,
The croaking raven stoops to drink
Its waters deep.
Helvellyn lifts to heaven its crests,
Above the yale where Thirlmere rests;
And Borrowdale.
Sends greeting o'er the lonely heights,
In clouds whose drifting cloak unites,
Lone vale to vale.
And Castle Crag towers o'er the scene,
And Wythburn Fells above it lean;
The while a stream
Flows through the hills to greet the world,
So far away! And mists are curled,
And white falls gleam.
Oh, mountain lake, all cold and grey!
Where silence broods, the livelong day,
In vain each hill
Stands sentinel about your shore,
To keep your waters evermore,
So dark and still."
The world has come too near, and takes
Your waters to herself, and breaks
Your silence deep.
Your mountains stand there cold and grand,
But silence dies from off the land,
And quiet sleep.

At last! After months of misgiving and fret,

But the querist is snubbed as an impudent bore.
O shapers of phrases now met in full feather,
What trouble it cost to bring you men together!
Etiquette diplomatio it put on its mettle
The form of the mere invitation to settle.
A façon de parler ? Well, phrases, like fashions,
Have changes as varied as projects and passions.
“ The status quo ante” was once all the rage ;
'Tis as dead as the dust of the Eocene age.
“Territorial integrity” ruled for awhile;
'Tis as much out of date as the Georgian " tile."
“Imperial interests" followed, a pbrase
That was flaunted with pride for the usual nine days,
A frivolity-formula useful to shut
Base Faction's big mouth; but it altered its out,
Took in “ Treaty-law” as a makeweight; and now
Well, to-day's ruling watchword seems doubtful somehow;
Able editors “hedge" slashing leaderists trim,
The look-out, though called couleur-de-rose, is yet dim;
Each stands like an Actor awaiting his cue,
When the new Cry is out, they will shout till all's blue.
Will it be such a phrase as in quiet shall close
The long wordy war of the cons and the pros?
Will the Shibboleth shaped by these Chiefs of the Tongue
Fit the lips of all those who have anxiously hung
On the issue? Will Babbledom end in mere Babel,
Or a modus vivendi as pleasant as stable ?
Who knows? Tongues can smooth, but they also can stab;
Midst these mustered experts at the gift of the gab
May the lenitive speech, not the lethal, abound,
And for Justice and Peace may the verdict be found.
Our Tongue-obampion starts midst a tumult of praises,
And Hughenden's Lord is a master of phrases,
Can use them like sword-thrusts, as fatal as fleet,
Or, in cuttle-fish fashion, to cover retreat.
The difference? One parely verbal, of course,
A façon de parler. Finesse and resource
Are his; ready rhetoric, fine as sophistic;
Facility lingual if not quite linguistio.
How, how will be use them? To stand or to yield ?
To conquer, or gracefully draw from the field
Will the supple-tongued Semite strong Saxon affet,
And be blunt à la BISMARCK? Or may we expect
That, without ever seeming to bend or to blenoh,
He may, let us say, take a lesson in French ?
The Gallio for “ Compromise" ? Out on the thought!
Russophobists will cry, “Is 't for that we have fought?
Humpty Dumpty's upheaval, the Cossack's rebuff,
Are the ends we've in view; all the rest is mere stuff.'
Nous verrons! But Congress may not be pure Jingo,
And, put in polite diplomatical lingo,
That word in the mouth of our Sphinx may be found
A sweet façon de parler to square things all round.

costume, they all agree in two points, i.e., bare legs,

bright little round buttons of tinsel which were, and

the children good “by the hour together," and was
much patronised by the nurses. To this form of

the eldest boy in a nursery. He has yet got to go to
school. His Perseus and the Graie is worked on the
principle above mentioned. Wherever the tinsel would
have been, there is the “metal ;” and where the bare
legs are, there they remain. It may be Perseus and the
Graie, but it is, apparently a Japanese warrior dis-
turbed, while dressing in full armour, by some larkish
young lady-visitors who have hidden his shoes, and he
is represented as running about in his armour, bare-
footed, playing with the flighty intruders a sort of

TAPS IN THE TOWER.
A CORRESPONDENT of the Times, “Vide et Crede,"
calls attention to a process, by which the inscriptions in
the Beauchamp Tower—those historical memorials of
illustrious captives and victims-are in course of rapid
obliteration. It is performed by a series of successive
Beefeaters. The Public, to be sure, are shut off by stout
posts, and a rope, four feet from the wall. But-
"Inside this rope, from morning to night, every day of the
year, except Sunday, with ten minutes' interval between his
rounds, marches a huge Beefeater, with a short stick. With
this stick he raps, taps, strikes, and pokes the time-honoured
inscriptions, as he explains their meaning; and I challenge
contradiction, when I assert that in many places fresh marks,
showing where the stone has been bruised by this shameful mal-
treatment are to be seen on the very inscriptions themselves."
Gutta cavat lapidem non vi sed sæpe cadendo. But the
Beefeater's raps on the carvings in the Beauchamp Tower
are forcible, as well as frequent. To put a stop to them
there is no need to abolish the Beefeater's venerable and
useful office of Showman. Tip his staff with India-rubber,
or some other soft and elastic substance. He could then
use it for the purpose of his archæological demonstration
without defacing the inscriptions, wbich he so instruc-
tively explains. The estimate for this truly Conservative
measure would hardly require a supplementary vote.
Prophetic Language of Flowers.
A REPORT of a Flower Show informs us that “Messrs.
VEITCH showed a new Begonia, high and stately in
growth, with a leaf tending towards the strawberry. The
plant is called, The Earl of Beaconsfield.'"
Messrs. VEITCH, perhaps, contemplate the probability
of having to raise their plant a step in the Peerage.
They will prove themselves Prophets, as well as Florists,
should the sequel of the Congress confirm the indication
of the leaf of their Begonia “tending towards the Straw-
berry." Then they will also, of course, have foretold a
pacifio solution of the Eastern Question.

---
truly observes, "they have attempted to
do this without attracting bis Lordship's
notice.” This has been easily managed.
When the British Premier wishes to take
a walk, a signal is given to a bugler, who
immediately sounds" To Arms !” As his
Lordsbip emerges from his hotel, three
squadrons of cavalry, half a battery of ar-
tillery, and a few battalions of infantry,
carelessly form around him and accompany
him in his walk. An advance-guard pre-
cedes the procession, ordering the shutters
to be closed in the houses overlooking the
line of march.
The other day Lord BEACONSFIELD walked
into a tobacconist's to buy a cigar. As
the shopman was serving him, a fierce-look-
ing stranger entered the establishment and
roughly asked for a pipe. With great
presence of mind the shopman whistled.
In a moment a number of riflemen, who
had been lying concealed under the counters
of the magazin, emerged from their ambush
and formed a hollow square round the
British Statesman. The rough-looking
stranger, evidently taken aback by the
sudden mancuvre, immediately retreated.
As Lord BEACONSFIELD does not understand
German, he could not be made to compre-
hend the reason of the demonstration. It
has thus come to pass that he still lives in
happy ignorance of the paternal care which
is being hourly lavished upon him.
Several accounts have appeared in the
London papers of the hospitality offered to
the Plenipotentiaries by Prince BISMARCK.
On the whole these reports are fairly accu-
rate, but they are decidedly crude. This
being the case, I give a few details of the
last fête in which the Foreign Ministers
and the German Chancellor took part.
As you know, BISMARCK is very fond of
practical jokes. It is rumoured that he
sent Prince GORTSCHAKOFF the basket of
strawberries which was the cause of his
Excellency's recent indisposition. To re-
turn. BISMARCK is very fond of practical
jokes, and having once seen an English
pantomime, His Excellency determined to
have the marble steps of his palace well
polished with butter. When his orders had
been obeyed, the burly Chancellor stood at
the top of the staircase enjoying the strange
antics of his guests as they walked towards
him. The Italian Ambassador was very
angry when he found himself upon the
ground; and Count ANDRASSY (who, as
usual, was wearing a Hungarian hussar's
uniform) could not rise without assistance.
Lord BEACONSFIELD, who is always on his
guard in his dealings with BISMARCK, re-
quested Lord SALISBURY to precede him.
A CAUTION TO RELATIVES.
The Foreign Secretary, only too pleased to
take the pas, immediately complied-with

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BIPEDS IN THE BERLIN ZOO !
THE readers of Punch, at any rate, were prepared for
the telegram from Berlin, the other day, informing them
that-
“Last night the fashionable world assembled at the Zoologi-
cal Gardens to see and welcome the members of the Congress,
who had promised to attend the ordinary Saturday concert."
With the representation of certain members of the
Congress in Mr. Punch's last Cartoon fresh in mind,
who could be surprised to learn that some of them were
exbibited at the Berlin Zoological Gardens ? Of course,
they attracted away all the spectators usually grouped
before the denizens of the ordinary dens.
“Some 12,000 persons were present, the ladies being dressed
in the height of fashion, and the whole presenting a very
interesting and animated spectacle.”
The show appears to have been a splendid success,
notwithstanding the absence of three of the chief mem-
bers of the diplomatic menagerie.
" There was hearty cheering as the Plenipotentiaries -
excepting Lord BEACONSFIELD, Prince GORTSCHAKOFF, and
Prince BISMAROK, who were prevented from attending-entered
the Gardens."
One of the biggest Lions, the biggest Bear, and the
biggest Eagle failed to show. Nevertheless, “all went
merry as a marriage-bell”-and merrier.
“The bands played the National hymns of the kingdoms re-
presented at the Congress, the public bestowing on all the various
anthems an equal amount of sympathy and burrahing. It was
the first time the Congress had come in contact with the public,
and the result appeared to give mutual satlofaction."
To all and sundry except, perhaps, the Carnivora in
the cages, whose very dinner-hour had for the time
lost its interest. It is easy to conceive bow horribly
they howled and roared with rage and jealousy. But
their outcries were drowned in the music of the bands
and the cheers of an applauding public; cheers which
all Europe will re-echo should Congress, as there is good
hope, conclude in a bappy issue out of the Eastern
Question, and an example of the way to settle inter-
national difficulties by less costly and bloody arbitrament
than that of Gunpowder.

Charles James Mathews.
BORN, DECEMBER 26, 1803.
DIED, JUNE 24, 1878,
Some happy souls with scarce an effort reach
Eads for which thought and toil had vaidly striven ;
Whate'er the will to learn, the pains to teach,
How few the favoured ones to whom is given
A mind so many-sided, bright, and keen,
So much accomplishment in various art-
To build the theatre, and paint the scene,
And write the play, and act the leading part.
His bark rode lightly o'er the shoals of life,
And braved the buffet of its stormiest swell;
'Twas something in this age of care and strife
To know one soul whose sun no cloud could quell.
And so he lived and acted, laughed and spread
An atmosphere of gaiety and grace;
Light as his artless art the life he led,
Ånd Old and New World hailed his welcome face.
A pleasantness the less is left the earth
Now he is gone: a brightness with him dies ;
England could easier spare more solid worth,
Than this gay soul's that breathed of sunnier skies.
But yesterday it scarce seemed he could die,
So blithe, so bright, so jubilant o'er time;
At seventy-five, still buoyant, frame and eye
As lithe and light, almost, as in his prime,
'Twas hard to think that he could e'er be old,
Still more that he was old, till, looking back,
One noted all our century's records hold
Of pleasant memories crowded on his track.
An Actor's son, himself born Actor, too,
Though not with power to top his father's part-
Who, of all English mimes on record, threw
Round mimicry most light of Truth and Art.
He trained his son not for, but from, a Stage,
From whose vulgarities he shrunk with pain;
And finding germs of Art, from earliest age
He nursed the seeds, that brought him fruit again.
Artist, amuser, mimic,-dangerous powers !
The boy grew, quick of wit, and fond of praise ;
A dial that by sunshine marked the hours,
And took no note of dark and cloudy days.
What wonder he was bright and light and gay,
Whom the world met so brightly, with a face
That gave back smile for smile, while on his way
All lighter gifts and Graces strove for place.
A Hint from “Hieover.”
WORSHIPFUL PUNCH,
As a Brother of the Brush-I don't mean a Painter, but
a Sportsman, who has never failed on occasion to be “in at the
death," and a distinguished performer in the hunting-field-you will
have observed, no doubt, with indignation, that the Criminal Code
Bill, now before Parliament, contains no clause providing any
penalty whatsoever for Vulpicide.
Would you, Sir, please point this omission ont to the ATTORNEY-
GENERAL, and let him know how many years' penal servitude you
consider adequate punishment for that atrocious offence.
Ever yours,

to Punch, conclusively, that its provisions to
check the spread of cattle diseases at home
are as much too weak, as its provisions for shut-
ting our ports against their importation from
abroad are, partly, inapplicable, partly in ex-
cess of the needs of the case. It ignores facts,
when it compels the slaughter of fat cattle
from Spain, Portugal, Denmark, and Norway,
where pleuro-pneumonia, and foot-and-mouth
disease are practically unknown. It lies in
their face, when it admits fat cattle from the
United States, the Canadas, and Ireland, where
these diseases are common. It overlooks the no-
torious truths that, whatever the origin of these
diseases, they have now become naturalised
amongst us, and that the only way of dealing
with them is by a strenuous supervision and
rigid isolation of diseased cattle, home and
foreign alike; that twelve per cent. of the
meat of England, and forty-seven per cent. of
that of London, come to us in the shape of
cattle imported from abroad; and that the rise
of price and curtailment of supply consequent
on what will in effect be the prohibition of
foreign importation of live cattle, is like to be
very serious—80 serious, as, with good reason,
to override even Mr. WHEELHOUSE's faith-
fulness to his Tory colours.
After Mr. FORSTER Professor PLAYFAIR and
Mr. RATHBONE delivered the most damaging
attacks on the Bill. Of course almost every
statement against the Bill had its contradic-
tion; but on the whole, Punch is bound to say
that the case against it seems, as far as he can
judge, immeasurably stronger than that in its
favour. That being his conclusion, he is con-
tent to state it without registering the collision
of orators pro and con. Monday, Tuesday,
Thursday the debate flowed on, and promises
to reach the middle of next week. It has dis-
regarded party considerations, and its upshot
may well be beyond the calculation or control
of the Whips. It looks, at present, as if the
Government would have either to withdraw the
measure, or so modify it that the President of
the Council will not know his child when it comes
back from the rude handling of the Commons.

Cattle Bill discussion was but imperfectly re-
lieved by the annual interlude of the Permis-

year, for Sir WILFRID was invalided, and had
to trot out his hobby in silence, reserving him-
self for his speech in reply, in which Punch, as
usual, congratulates him on his humorous pre-
sentation of the evils and extent of intemper-
ance-the 59 cases of wife-beating, attempts
at murder, poisoning, brutal assaults, and other
crimes traced, in one day's search through the
newspapers, up to the accursed fountain of the
Bottle; the 140 millions spent annually in in-
toxicating liquors; the 350,000 drunken cases
taken up by the police-and the ten times

Of a terrible Turk, a horrid old sham,
Who many a year had said, “I am
The greatest glory of great Islám.”.
With a tooral looral, &o.
He'd a fine estate this terrible Turk,
But he loved his ease and he hated work.
And his only care was all care to shirk,
To bully his slaves, and his creditors burke.
With a tooral looral, &c.
Protest who might, he'd not yield a peg;
He sucked his thralls as you'd suck an egg,
And if for pity they came to beg,
He kicked them out with his terrible leg.
With a tooral looral, &c.
But at last of fighting he had his fill,
And in a terrible Tartar Mill
He got his best leg crushed, until
This terrible Turk lay spent and still.
With a tooral looral, &c.
His foes rejoiced, and his slaves made game
Of the terrible Turk, sudden fallen lame,
For they thought the mishap might his temper tame,
Or, at least, that he couldn't kick quite the same.

By scheming the Turk's leg-restoration.

Says he, “Don't get in a rage, I beg,
Only trust to my patent Balkan leg ;
And, strong on that artificial peg,
You'shall stand like an Eastern Silas Wegg."
With a tooral looral, &c.
The Turk didn't see his way out of it quite,
So Artist and doctors made it all right;
And the wooden leg shaped fair to sight,
And fitted it on, and screwed it tight.
With a tooral looral, &c.
Both Tartar and Turk thought the leg a bore,
And the Turk's poor thralls did the dodge deplore;
For they thought, “If the old rogue's limbs they restore,
He 'll soon be kicking as hard as before."
With a tooral looral, &c.
Quoth a rival Artist, one W. G.,
Who with restoration did not agree,
“Much better have left the job to me,
I'd have cut off the other leg, too, d'ye see ?"

But the artful Artist contented stood,
And regarded his work in triumphant mood.
“At odds I'll back the new leg of wood
Against the old one of flesh and blood.”
With a tooral looral, &c.
Says W, G., "'Tis fine to talk.
No doubt you fancy you've scored a chalk.
The foes of the Turk''tis your aim to baulk.
But wait till the old rogue tries to walk."
