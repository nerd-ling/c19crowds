PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

EDISON had retired—extinguished for once. PUKCH was just turning down his own Electric Illuminator, with which he
had cruelly quenched the newest light of the famous Transatlantic Inventor, when a deep but cheery voice sounded from
the half-dark of the ante-aibjtiim.
"Don't put that out yot, lieber alter! Let me see PUNCH for once standing in his own light!"
And, with a ringing laugh, the REICHSKANZLER strode into the sanctum, flinging open his huge fur cloak, and stamping
the snow from his heavy cuirassier boots, as he held out his hand with a hearty " Pros't neucs jahr I"
POUCH shook the strong hand cordially, and motioning the Prince to a chair, took his own place at the Round Table
of Council alongside his distinguished visitor, to whom he pushed his own private box of Regalias.
It was an impressive moment. There sat the two Powers of the World in presence! Strange, the Globe continued to
revolve, as if there was f till the normal distance between its two pivots.
"The truth is, old man," said the Prince, after taking in the contents of the sanctum with a sweeping glance, " I want
jour counsel."
"You will find it in my back numbers," was the calm and dignified reply.
"I have no time to read."
"A despatch is soon written."
"Not so soon as a friendly word is spoken under four eyes," said the Prince, pleasantly. "Even I find it hard to
come straight to the point on paper. It is true I am used to diplomatic correspondents. If you knew what a horror their
plauderei gives one of despatches!"
"Have I not correspondents of my own?" sighed PUKCH.
"And a waste-paper basket—happily for you. We have only archives. No; pen and ink—present company's always
excepted—is silvern; speech—present company's in particular—is golden; next best thing, in fact, to silence. You and I
know how to speak to each other."
"Thanks to the latest light out of the BUSCH !—if that be not, as some say, a mere marsh-light, meant to mislead."
"Ach, dieser armer Buschlein I" laughed the burly REICHSKANZLER. "Indiscreet—eh? to let one's tame newspaper-
organ grind on its own account. Contrary to all diplomatic proprieties? That's why I like it. Fancy the long faces in the
Chancelleries! And the infinite deal rf nothing BUSCHLEIK'S buchlein will set flowing from Plenipotcntial pens! For once
their Excellencies will have something to hang their nothings on."
"One fact, at least, he puts the world up to—your Excellency's favourite tipple," said PUNCH, pleasantly, motioning
ttwards the buffet.
"And here we are at the fountain-head of the Porfcr—if not of tl:e Pommery. Schenclc ein I" replied the Prince in
the Eame tone.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 4, 1879.
To decant a bottle of the choicest sec into a foaming pot of the best bottled Barclay, was, for PUNCH, the work of a
moment. To floor it, was, for the Prince, the work of another.
"Das schmeltt gut!" said the REICHSKANZLER, drawing along breath, as he lifted his broad, bold beak from the pewter.
"And now, like ancient Teutons, having liquored, let us take counsel. About this troublesome Reichstag? Parliamentary
plauderei is worse than Diplomatic."
"Take a hint from BEACONSFIELD. lie docs not find his Majority troublesome."
"Even he has GLADSTONE and the Opposition. Besides, in that jrewt-ridden Vaterland of ours, all parties will insist
on having wills, wits, and ways of their own—idiotic, of course, but all the stubborner. Such a dumb, disciplined Majority
and Cabinet as your BEACONSFIELD is blessed with, are not for me—worse luck!—or I would have made something better out
of them than an Asia Minor Convention and an Afghan War."
"You forget Cyprus, and Peace with Honour!"
The Prince looked at PUNCH; PUNCH looked at the Prince. Then, slowly and simultaneously, their thumbs rose to
the tips of their noses, and their fingers expanded.
"He is very clever," taid the Prince, after a pause. "Next to my own career, I know none so "—here he paused for
a word—" h'm—remarkable. I always respect architects of their own fortunes. One may even be pardoned for being curious
about their tools and plans, though one has no right to be critical, in this world of Parliaments and Plenipotentiaries."
"He still awaits the revelations of his BUSCH."
"Yes, MONTAGUE COREY is really a Private Secretary. But I hate mysteries, Asian or European. I like going straight
to the point, no matter what I may have to walk over, whether it be what commonplace people call good taste, good manners,
delicacy, humanity—u-«s soil ich sagen ?—prejudices of all kinds. One has one's omelettes to make, and it is idle to cry over the
eggs. Your BKACONSFTELD plays his cards differently. We saw a good deal of each other—I was almost saying 'into each
Other," aber das war nicht so leicht—at Berlin. We play different games. But then our stakes are so different. He punts
for himself. I for Vaterland. Apropos of Vaterland, we are wasting time. To our counsel. First, there is this
distress, bitter, wide-spread, and spreading ever wider; then these unreasonable discontents with discipline and the drill-
sergeant; then these u-icder-wiirtigo Priests; then these stupid Socialists—not bad fellows, by any means, some of them;
LASALLK was a wonderfully clever kerl—might have been a Beaconsfield had his lot been cast here, and had he been cooler
over his cards—and BUCUEB is a trump, for all he has come through the Socialist mill; then there 's this old quarrel between
Free Trade and Protection, which you English flattered yourselves you had settled"
"Stop, Prince !" interposed PUNCH, courteously, but firm'y. "Immensely flattered to be pumped by your Excellency;
but on condition you allow PUNCH his turn at your handle. We have the same red-hot questions among us that blaze
or smoulder among you:—the Dis'ress; the Discontent; the Priests—within the walls of our Protestant Church, too,
not outside of it, as with jou; Socialism, though with us it has hardly got beyond Trades'-uuionism, and striking at its own
brt ad- and-butter, instead of its Sovereign; Protection—What if LOUD BEACOXSFIELU'H last transmutation were to be into a
defender of Free Trade agaiust his own pack? On all these burning questions if I am to show you how to throw cold water,
I shall expect jou to return the favour. My counsel stands ready written—here!" And PUNCH laid his hand on a volume
bound in regal purple. "Where is the record of yours?"
"H'm! I write in Acts, nut Books," said the Prince. "As for written record of me, compared with yours, as the
Greek warrior in Homer says, 'tis ' Brass armour against golden: things worth nine oxen for things worth a hundred.'"
And he placed in PUNCH'S hands BUSCHLEIN'S Graf Bismarck imd seine Leute, in unequal exchange for PUNCH'S
latest treasure of Wit and Wisdom

FRUITLESS!
(A Oroanfrom
"Th» eitraerdinary fecundity of the United States in the matter of fruit
U proverbial; but it ma; not be generally known that three million peach
trees bloora every spring on the sunny plains between the Delaware ami
Chesapeake Bays. The details of the American fruit crop almost savour of
romance. The apple crop of the country is past counting; the surplus fruit,
if properly saved, would keep all Europe in table luxuries. The birds on
New Hampshire hills are feasted with raspberries, the mountains of North
Carolina and Tennessee are purple with blackberries which go to waste; and
the time has been when an extra good crop of peaches in Delaware has meant
a million baskets of fruit untouched upon the trees." — Standard.
MB. PUNCH,
THIS startling extrack, -which I venture to enclose,
TOM, my nephew, read out loud, in aggerawation, I suppose.
I woa picking a few gooseberries, -with a eye to jam, and he
Said he thought it aperypo — whatever that may chance to be.
Which / call it downright riling. Gracious goodness! here am I
Paying sech a price for fruit as is enough a Saint to try,
"While in Delaware by millions peaches waste upon the trees,
And on the New Hampshire hills the birds eats as much fruit as they
please.
Well, them Yanka is precious lucky. Things in England is gone
queer.
Fruits with us ain't wot they wos, but mostly poor, and likewise
dear.
Wot with blights and sopping summers, big jam-makers, and them
Clubs,
Little fruit tee gets, and wot we do is windfalls, specks, and scrubs.
Strorberries ain't got no sweetness; as for apples, bless yer 'art,
Not one sample in a dozen 's fit for pudden or for tart;
For cherries they 're all skin and stone, and as for ribsting apples,
lor!
They 're like good Cheshire eheese, a pleasink mem'ry, and no more.
True, there's lots of ram new-fangled things as they call forren
fruits,
Eatin' like raw scarlet-runners, or as tough as rhubarb roots,
Prickly pears and them bananas, tasting jest like sweetened soap,
But you won't find British housewives cottoning to sech, I hope.
England's fruits was England's pride, and 'ome-made jam our house-
hold boast;
0 the rare tucks-out I 've had of gooseberry-fool and buttered toast!
Then the jars of raspberry-jam—but there, it doesn't bear a thought.
If there's any raspberries grow'd they 're all by CEOSSE AND BLACK-
WELL bought.
Them shop-jams is hutter 'umbug; but we never has no sun,
And the fruiting season's over most afore it seems begun.
TOM declares Pomoner's cut us; wot he means I do not know,
But I 'm sure our fruits to-day ain't like the fruits of long ago.
Apples! Wy, the shams we gets is jest heartbreaking. I believe
If they 'd grow'd like that at fust, one never would have tempted
EVE;
Which I 've always felt conwinced the fruit as caused that fatal
slippin'
Must a' bin that British pride, a rog'lar good old ripsting pippin!
Haven't seen one not for years, the fruiterers say they 're dying out.
Wy the dickens did they let 'cm? Wot must they have bin about?
Now we 've nowt but measley windfalls, tasteless and but seldom
sound,
Sold in open shops by Jews, and, like pertaters, by the pound.
Then to read about them Yankees, with their splendid apple-crop,
Their three million blooming peach-trees, and—but there I 'd better
stop!
Which I 'm a patriot, I 'ope, but a turn in Tennessee
Would, I fear, make half a Yankee of Yours sadlr,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

WE know now that it was not Count SCHOUVALOFF who" let the
great Foreign Office cat with nine tales out of the baglthe pther'day,
but a writer, at tenpence an hour, who, finding within his reach a
secret paper that was worth money, very naturally sold it. Now
that the cat has been let out, everybody (Lords, ^Monday. July 1)
ig much amazed that the custody of so valuable an animal should
have been trusted to such temptible and contemptible hands.
Lord GHANVTLLE has been three times at the Foreign Office in the
last twenty years, and cannot'believe that under his regime such a
laches would have been possible (no harm in making" a little party
capital out of the case). In those halcyon days—i. e. in the F. 0.
of our time— everybody trusted everybody, and nobody ever heard
of cats being let out of bags.
Lord HAMMOJTD, Nestor of the Foreign Office, of half a century's
service within those sacred walls, who owes to the Office his title,
his credit, all he is, and has, and knows, who has been brought up
from the green and salad days of his youth to the evening of bos age
on its rules and records, grey traditions, and red-tape, is even more
seriously exercised at the thought of this great and gnevous blot on
the F. (5. scutcheon. But Lord H. rises above the mere Whig and
Tory view of the matter. In his mind the dereliction has a deeper
root. It all comes of the detestable habit of "employing persons of
whose antecedents and connections the SECRETAHY ot STATE has no
other knowledge than is afforded by a certificate of proficiency and
fitness granted them by the Civil Service Commissioners, after an
open competitive examination." Inference: Keep the Foreign Office
doors at least shut against writers, and competition-wallahs, and
all that low class of people who trust for advancement to their
work, their wits, and a Civil Service certificate.
Where all the bags are full of cats, none but persons of known
antecedents and connections should be admitted to handle the
strings. Competition and examination may supplv the sort of
article'wanted for the lower Offices; but leave the Olympian Office
which has to deal with the Eleusinian mysteries of Diplomacy, to
look for its Clerks to the "good old rule—the simple plan"—of
nomination and family favour.
Very plausibly pleaded, my Lord HAMMOND. Competitive exami-
nation has been hard ridden. All that doctrinairism could do to
discredit its pet panacea, it has done. There is only one thing
worse; and that is the old principle of patronage, in whose favour

its supporters are cleverly using this sale to the Globe of the
Salisbury-Schouvaloff agreement.
(Commons.) — After much desultory talk, in which the employment
of writers in the Foreign Office at tenpenoe an hour was mixed up
with the Indian Press Act, Cretan disturbances, Home-Harbour
Loans, Irish Arms-searches, and the appointments to the Halifax
Beach, the well thrashed Cattle Bill discussion was resumed, and all
the old reasons for and against it reiterated with that stolid indiffer-
ence to the weariness of the House and the exhaustion of the subject
which shows that a question has passed out of the range of reasoning
into that of parti pns.
Colonel RUGGLES-BRISE was a splendid specimen of the bucolic
Member in this stage of utter imperviousness to argument and in-
difference to infliction of all his tediousness upon his audience.
In the teeth of what Punch cannot but feel to be proof te demon-
stration of the impotence of the Bill to effect its professed object — of
keeping out foot-and-mouth disease-^and the certainty of its restrict-
ing the import of cattle, and so raising the price of meat to the con-
sumer, the division gave the Government the overwhelming majority
of 157 in a House of 481. But till the Bill is through Committee,
we will not believe that the Government, even in all the might of its
majority, will venture to leave its most glaring defects unremedied.
Tuesday (Lordi) .—The Irish Intermediate Education Bill passed
through Committee, with cheers, without a single Amendment or
alteration in clause or schedule. Let the amazing fact be noted;
and let my Lord CAIRNS be duly congratulated thereon. Raise
Cairns to his honour of all the stones that have been flung at all be-
fore him who have attempted to deal with Irish Education. When our
Legislators do agree on an Irish measure, their unanimity is won-
derful. Can it be that the million of Established Church appro-
priation has done it all? Suppose my Lord CAIRNS took heart of
grace and appropriated another million from the same source to
increase the salaries of the Irish National School Masters P Surely
Irish National Education wants improving an much as Irish Inter-
mediate ditto.
(Commons.) — The morning Sitting spent in debate on Scotch
Roads and Bridges — nice bracing exercise - ground for this hot
weather; and the evening on the less seasonable, and more unsavoury
subject of Irish Paupers Removal. It seems, on Mr. MACAHTHY
DOWNINS'S showing, that England is still too much addicted to the
practice of shifting her burden of out-worn Irish Pauperism on to
ould Ireland's maternal back, in spite of Ireland's natural enough
contention that where the Pauper nas given his labour—Awhile he
had it to give—he has established the best claim for maintenance
when he can work no longer. Till the good time shall come for
the utter abolition of the barbarous law of settlement—that relic
of a bad time, now, it is to be hoped, past away for ever—Mr.
DOWNING was fain to content himself with Mr. SCLATEE-BOOTH'S
promise to employ all the power of the Local Government Board to
diminish cases of hardship in the removal of Irish Paupers back to
Ireland. The principal of "Ireland for the Irish" does not apply
to her Pauperism.
Wednesday.—No maniacs are more mischievous to themselves or
their families than dipsomaniacs. Dr. DALRYMPLE, one of the few
medical Members of the House, devoted himself to the task of Legis-
lation for the restraint of this peculiarly wretched class of lunatics;
and, in fact, sacrificed health and life in his labours to this end.
Dr. CAMERON, another of the few doctors who leaven the Collective
Wisdom, has inherited Dr. DALRYMPLE'B task, and has rendered it
easier by throwing over the more ambitious part of the Doctor's large
design, which aimed at providing asylums for dipsomania out of the
rates, and at giving compulsory powers for the confinement and re-
straint of dipsomaniacs. Dr. CAMERON'S Bill is confined ,to volun-
tary and private machinery. Tipsy-lunatio Asylums may be
established at cost of individuals, to which dipsomaniacs, in their
lucid intervals, may commit themselves, or may be committed by
their friends, with due precautions taken against undue encroach-
ment on personal liberty; and when once committed may be detained
for the time required to give a fair chance of cure. The worst
enemies of the Bill must admit its moderate and tentative character;
and as an experiment for the remedying of a grievous evil, which
can now only be dealt with by difficult and costly private arrange-
ments, every sensible person must wish it well, and will watch its
working with interest.
It should be called a " Bill to prevent tnen from putting an enemy
into their mouths to steal away their brains."
Punch congratulates Dr. CAMERON on the discretion he has shown
in handling a difficult subject, and on the favourable reception given
to his Bill.
CO-OPERATIVE WEDDING PRESENTS.
OfRTEOtTS ME. PfrJTCH,
WHAT to do with
your cold mutton is one
of the most momentous
questions of the day;
and scarcely less dis-
tracting to the domestic
mind is the problem,
what to do with your
old wedding-presents P
I don't suppose the
givers of these gifts care
vastly what becomes of
them. Still one can
i \ hardly sell a present;
Iff and, indeed, were there
no moral objection to the
sale, a purchaser might
seldom very readily be
found. Nor would it be
thought proper', to raise
money on such articles,
although so many wedding-gifts are by mishap made in duplicate,
that the pawn-shop seems to be their fitting destination, after they
have been displayed upon the nuptial day. I remember that
my wife and I together, when we married, were blest by loving
friends and relatives, with two egg-boilers, three cruet-stands, and
no fewer than five card-trays: and one of our first quarrels arose
from a debate as to which of these kind presents we should keep for
times of ceremony, and which we should regard as meant for daily use.
Use? Well, yes, there is some use in cruet-stands and egg-
boilers, and even in a card-tray there may be some social service,
especially to snoblings who catch some titled visitors, and are care-
ful to display their cards conspicuously atop. But wedding-gifts in
general are most expensive nicknacks of no possible utility, except,
perhaps, to furnish topics for small talkers, and, when displayed as
chimney-ornaments, to collect and show the dust. Besides, it is
annoying, after giving SMITH a card-tray on his marriage with
Miss JONES, to find that BROWN and ROBINSON have each sent him
the same article, and that yours is clearly the least costly of the
three. How much wiser it would be to join with BROWN and
ROBIXSOX, and, if need be, WHITE and WILKIXS, in making SMITH

a present of a grand piano, say, or a handsome set of dinner-tables,
or some curtains for his drawing-room, or some carpets for his stairs.
Instead of thanking his kind friends for egg-boilers and card-trays,
and similar nicknackeries, many a man would gladly see his tailor's
bill receipted on his marriage, or find a bin of claret stocked for him,
or a cellar filled with coals.
"Many can help one" is a rather common motto of the Artists
who paint landscapes and shipwrecks on the pavement, appropriately
interspersed with slices of pink salmon and delicate arrangements of
mackerel in pea-green. Were friends to club together, they might
furnish a man's house for him with the money they now waste in
buying useless wedding-gifts. Everybody knows what a bore it is to
have to choose a wedding-present, and how sure one always feels
that one has chosen just the thing which is most certain to be given
by everybody else. By clubbing, individuals might save themselves
this bother, and the dread of giving duplicates would be utterly
removed. Both to givers and receivers, wedding-presents nowadays
are weights upon the mind; and the bliss of happy couples might bo
sensibly increased, were they no longer burthened with the care of
costly nicknacks, wherewith, as time progresses, they are puzzled
what to do.
My voice, then, is for gifts on the co-operative system, whereof
the wisdom must be evident without another word from
Yours most truly, VERBUM SAP.
THE RESOLVE OF HELLAS.
WITH smooth speech and promise fair,
Rubbed the right way of the hair,
Bade "be a good little Greece,"
Hold my hand, and keep the peace,
Awaiting nice things by-and-by,—
British Lion's Greece waa I.
Snubbed and sneered at, and abused;
Denied Epirus, Crete refused);
In my old cramped limits pent,
Blood spilt idly, money spent,
Now British faith is proved a lie,—
Muscovite Bear's Greece am I.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Thursday (Lords).—It has occurred to some bright light of the
Green Isle that if the new Irish Intermediate Education Scheme is
to work such wondrous good for the sons of Erin, it should also,
in fairness, be made applicable to Erin's daughters. But this, Lord
CAIRNS says, will involve some reconsideration of the rules of his
Bill, and some re-arrangement of the machinery. Why not? We
are only beginning to acknowledge the truth that girls have as much
right as boys to be considered in questions of educational legislation,
and in the application of educational endowments. It is but fair
that the Irish lasses, charming as they are in their uneducated state,
should have all the benefit of this larger wisdom of our time, which
has ceased to exclude the better half of humanity from the right to a
seat at the School Board or a participation in its banquets.
(Commons.)— The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER does not see his
way to a Supplementary Budget till he sees his way to a Supple-
mentary Estimate. And this will depend on the upshot of the Berlin
Congress.
In the course of ten daya or a fortnight he hopes the accounts
may be made up. So does Punch, and wishes the Government a
good deliverance.
Colonel STANLEY doesn't want to keep the Reserve men longer with
the colours than can be helped; but can't say, just at present, when
they will be free to return to their families.
Before the Reserves are called out again, we hope some arrange-
ment will be made to keep their wives and children off the rates, or,
at least, out of the workhouse. They manage these things better in
France—not to say Germany.
Mr. BOURSE, for the Foreign Office, fought shy of a question as to
the employment of writers at tenpenoe an hour on secret and confi-
dential documents.
Mr. FAWCETT wants to give the Metropolitan Board of Works four
members on the Epping Forest Committee of Management, which is
to be made up of tour selected verderers and twelve conservators to
be chosen by the Corporation. But the Corporation have secured
Epping Forest for the public, and it seems unfair to give the Board
of Works a voice in its management, when they declined to fight
for its acquisition by the public.
Sir J. LUBBOCK tried to get Elementary Natural Science added—
as an extra—to the Three R's in the Education Code.
Mr. FORSTER thinks the addition may safely be made; but the
Collective Wisdom said no by 68 to 37. The majority thinks National
Education has gone fast enough and far enough already, and if it
had dared speak out, it would have echoed Mr. 1). DA VIES s warning
"of the growing feeling in some parts of the country against over-
education."
Mr. MONK talked about Crete, and the expediency of promoting its
annexation to the kingdom of Greece.
Mr. JiiJi nh i: said it was impossible that any one Power could say
that any portion of the Turkish possessions should be annexed to a
foreign country. Of course if it came to a big country insisting on
such annexation, and other big countries could be got to back the
demand, Congress could do something. But really Greece was a
small Power; she could not make herself formidable to Europe;
her hands were not quite clean, and there was every prospect that
if she got anything by concession of the Congress it would be
much less than she had bargained for. (At least, if Punch hasn't
exactly said "ditto to Mr. BOUBKE," he has given his own reading
between the lines of Mr. BOURKE'S speech as reported.)
The Education Estimates were, on Mr. FORSTER'S protest against
proceeding with them close on midnight, adjourned.
Friday (Lords).—Talk about two subjects, on both of which there
is room tor improvement—Irish crime, and Irish public health. We
are going to consolidate the law on the latter. Perhaps that may
be preliminary to putting it in force.
(Commons.)—The enfant terrible of the House, the bold, bald
Member for Bonny Dundee, brought out the hot-poker of Ritualism in
the English Church—falsely so called. Nobody could deny the poker,
or the Force with which it was flourished in the face of the House
by JiNXs's irrepressible Baby. But the Batavian humour and
Ecclesiological enthusiasm of Mr. A. B. HOPE, the mild wisdom of
the Right Hon. H. S. WAXPOLE, the official oil of euphemistic Sir
STAFFORD NORTHCOTE, and even the prize Protestantism of Mr.
NEWDEOATE, united to deprecate any premature thrusting of the
poker before JOHN BULL'S eyes, or nourishing it alarmingly near his
calves. Nobody could say who might not burn his fingers. So the
Honourable Member for Dundee, satisfied with the agitation he had
aroused, and the deprecations he had provoked, withdrew his hot-
poker—for the present.

SHOES OR NO SHOES?
MB. RANSOM declares that horse-shoes are not only useless but
mischievous, and quotes a South American experience extending over
many years, and all sorts of ground, hard and soft, mud and stones.
His experience does not seem to have included artificial hard stone
pavements and hard made roads, such as those our horses have
to travel. It is true that human soles can be made, by long use,
as impervious as sole-leather, and so, much more, might horses' hoofs
be hardened to iron. But you must begin at the beginning, and
never let your colt wear a shoe from the day it is foaled.
The argument against shoes is very much like that against clothes
altogether. We don't dress our horses, it may be said, so why
should we shoe 'em?
Probably the chance of our seeing the last of horse-shoes is about
as great as that we shall see men and women going naked and bare-
foot. We should fancy that at least as many human feet are spoiled
by bad shoeing as equine. Altogether Punch can't bring himself to
feel that horse-shoes are a cruelty like bearing-reins. They have,
at least, something to stand on.
A Voice From the Lions' Heads.
To MB. PUNCH, SIB,—
ARE we always to be only ornamental? Again I see the
voice of common sense and^common numanity is raised in the papers
in recommendation of that simple often-urged precaution against

Why not P We are willing. It is the only chain the British Lion
can carry without blushing. Please move the London Board of Works,

Sizty (blowing a cloud). Very pleasant sitting!
Dizzy. Extremely so! GOSTSCHAKOFF, though, didn't quite seem
to relish my complimenting him on his apparently robust health.
Bizzy. Looked more bilious than gouty, eh? Well, it would be
hard it a valetudinarian might not play " le Malade Imaginaire " for
the benefit of his country—
Dizzy (drily). Or even to cut short dangerous discussion, or keep
down rising temper, eh?
Bizzy. Well, I really feel very seedy, you know.
Dizzy. Awfully sorry. I 'm sure. Now your Berlin air seems to
agree with me. Never felt better in my lite.
Bizzy. Happy to hear it. Hope your health may not receive
check or chill when you get back to London. I hear the temperature
there has changed considerably since you left.
Dizzy. Oh. ours is a variable climate, but I 'm used to it. Long
experience of mutability teaches one adroitness of adjustment.
Sizzy. Doubtless. Change of—ahem!—costume may sometimes
be as essential to the hero as to the histrio.
Dizzy. Aye! as needful as occasional change of air. Even con-
stitutions of blood and iron may sometimes welcome^ for many
reasons, the transition from Berlin to shall we say, Mssingen?
Sizzy. My post is, at all events, a trying one to an enfeebled con-
stitution like mine; and this supplementary Congress business has,
I confess, a little bit knocked me up—not possessing your own
splendid powers of recuperation, you know.
Dizzy. You scarcely do yourself justice, Prince. I must compli-
ment you upon being a judicious bottle-holder," as well as an
"honest broker." You keep the Ring splendidly; and your cry of
"Time!" is ever pat to the moment.
Sizzy. I do not know much about your Frize-Ring; but is not
the comparison a little mat a propos f Duty calls me to this post,
in the interests of Peace, but I should not be inclined to fag myself
out for the furtherance of War.
Dizzy. Precisely. You keep us in order capitally.
Bizzy. Oh! I make no pretensions.
Dizzy. Of course not. Fulminations are out of fashion in the
political Olympus. Where the ancient Jupiter would have flourished
his thunderbolts, the modern Jove'fingers his watch and consults his
time-table.
Bizzy (aside.) Very fair — for a phraseur. If smart speech
and sound statesmanship were synonymous! (Aland.) Well, I
suppose the worst of it s over. The small fry, I hope, will lake
their scraps thankfully, and their snubs meekly—for the time being,
at any rate. But, cntre nous, I don't think your friend, the Turk,
quite likes it.
Dizzy (thoughtfully). Ah! that's another party that will have
to be educated. AVell, 1 have dealt with pupils as intractable at
home.
Sizzy. By the way, your own more extreme worshippers may
require a little tactful tuition, eh?
Dizzy. Oh, the Jingoes? Doubtless! I hear they 're rather on the
rampage at present, some of them. Like speedy non-stayers, good
only for forcing the pace, they must "come back" to the leaders
when it's a case of real racing. Nothing like the " Dissolving View"
system to deal with these people. The " Glorious Triumph" slide
will gradually merge into the Satisfactory Settlement" one, you '11
see; only a few Jingoes will detect the difference, and they wUl feel
bound to swear there is none.
liizzy (tuggestively). GLADSTONE?
Dizzy. A voice crying in the wilderness. Let him shout. The
walls of the Tory Jericho will not fall to the trumpet and lamp of that
political Joshua.
Bizzy. The "status quo ante bellum," and " territorial integrity."
Dizzy. Watchwords of the past that have served their turn.
Public opinion deals with results, and is impatient of retrospective
criticism. Ask the Times.
Bizzy. Humph! The Times has asked me—several things. I
hope it has been satisfied with the frankness of my answers.
Dizzy. Who could object to your frankness, Prince? It is so
refreshing after a surfeit of transparent finesse and transpontine
dissimulation. Capital cigars these.

Ditzy. Success is a fortress most surely taken by what you would
call "a siege of patience."
Dizzy. That depends upon the besieger, and his resources. A
coup-de-main sometimes succeeds.
Dizzy. When patience has prepared the way for it. It is true
that patience may sometimes with advantage keep a coup in reserve.
Dizzy. Like a card up the sleeve?

BEFOHE leaving London I had ordered a boat to be made after my
own design, on a Noah's Ark pattern, with a sliding roof like that at
Canterbury Hall, through which, as the proprietor of that establish-
ment used to explain, the Moon (as an extra treat not included in the
bill) was exhibited to the unclothed eye. This vessel was constructed
according to my order, by Messrs. NEWTUBBS AMD JENNEE (to whom
I jennen&j go for anything special), of the Noah's Arkade, Pic-
cadilly. It was made into separate chambers, reminding the casual
observer of something between a Revolver and the French Senate.
The windows were formed to open and shut, and the whole vessel
was so constructed as to fold up on the gibus principle, er to take to
pieces at a moment's notice, and be stowed away in the smallest
possible pocket ship's eompass. Nothing could be more perfect for
it* particular purpose, ana Mr. HAXILET might get a hint Erra it for
his model lodging-houses, arranged for flats.
The order lor victualling I sent to Messrs. LOOM LOOM & Co.
(the Unlimited Xoo-is Co.), who had furnished the excellent provi-
sions for my will. This firm aleo supplied me with whatever I
wanted in the shape of draughts. Coals were a necessity, as, though
on a visit to the Black Country, if the natives were inhospitable,
and unwilling to trade, we should be in a pretty considerable hole—
a pretty considerable coalhole; and so the order for scuttling the
ship I entrusted to an eminent Sea Captain, whose name was on the
Black Books at Lloyds, and who had the still further recommenda-
tion of being well known to the Police.
In order to amuse and interest the natives, I laid in a large store
of Dominoes and Black Draughts.
Having in view the conversion of the various tribes, I took out a
second-hand edition of MrniK's Circulating Library Hymns, ar-
ranged by a noted Dry-Psalter. To secure their due and impressive
rendering, I secured the services of a Quire, in twenty-four white
sheets, which I called my '' Surplice Population," and stowed 'em away
as best I could in the Arkadia,—which was the name of my new and

The "House-boat" part can be lowered nnd folded up in rough weather.
Two more masts can be put up at a moment's notice. The entire construction
can be turned (when on land) into a show with the peepholes below for the

original vessel. In my spare moments I invented a Bock Harmonicon
for the sea-shore; and for full orchestral service at sea, I devised a
floating musical-box, with three hundred tunes in separate barrels,
which, firmly attached to the Arkadia. would accompany us on our
voyage. This I called our " Minstrel Buoy." Most of the melodies
were MOORE'B (of St. James's Hall, Piccadilly, and Burgess Hill,
Sussex), who hod previously instructed me in the banjo and bones,
and the dialect of the Black Countries I was to pass through. The
same excellent gentleman (to whom 1 here beg to tender my acknow-
ledgments) provided me with the back numbers of his celebrated
Almanack for many years past, which I subsequently found to be
of the greatest service to the Aborigines, who, being behindhand
in civilisation) had to make up for lost time. A century hence,
perhaps, the sixty or seventy tribes which now regulate their days,
months, and moons by their various Old Moore's Almanacks, will
hold a Congress, to find out, and settle exactly, what the time of Day
is. At present they are. as might be expected, rather in the dark.
Having thus made aU my preparations, and stowed everything,
including a large quantity of jewellery, theatrical properties, lime-
light arrangements, Ac., &c., on board the Arkadia. I fixed a day
for final settlement with all those tradesmen who had so generously
assisted me in the work. Having made an appointment with these
estimable persons, who were to assemble in their thousands ut the
Office in Fleet Street, and having given them strict injunctions not
to leave till I came, it was with tie deepest regret (which 1 found
expressed in my diary soon afterwards) that I learnt how, by some
strange mistake, they were received with contumely by the clerk in
charge, who, by an oversight (quite unpardonable in anyone except
a traveller so pre-oocupiea as myself), had not been informed of their
coming,
But Time and Tide—especially Tide—will not wait for anyone;
and finding that if I did not set soil that very afternoon—at the very
minute, in fact, when these excellent persons were expecting me in
Fleet Stmt—I sh«uld b» unable to Jo at all, I wired, at tie last
moment, th»s* werds: "Punctuality it tht toui of business. Do
net trait after ttvtn, if you have anything better to do." And, with
• ringing i-heer from all en beard, the Arkadia set soil from shore.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
I had come on board in disguise, so as to prevent an ovation, and from my
steerage-turret I saw thick sticks waving, white fists shaking, white faces
looking very long and sad, and more-or-less white hands nourishing strips of
paper of all sorts and sizes (my people had been lavish in their orders at the
seaport-town where we had been staying previous to departure), as, removing
my red wig and whiskers, trick nose, and spectacles, I stood on the top-gallant-
poop, and scarcely able to control my emotion, as I bade a long farewell to Old
England, I murmured, in a breaking voice,
"Cheer, boys, cheer!
Cheer, bojs, cheer!
Whatever is, ia right!
My native land, good night!"
And so we sailed out into the deep, deep sea; and as the thought crossed us
all, that, though "lost to sight, we were to memory uncommonly dear," a
gentle, placid smile of contentment illumined our features, for we knew then
that, once on the voyage to which we had vowed our lives and devoted our
energies, no one of those whom we had left behind, would see us again until
our return,—and, perhaps, not even then.
There were no Hurrahs from the crowd, so I cheered myself, with the con-
soling thought, "I am going for STANLEY!"

ONCE more at Jarnziri-bar. Most of the lively inhabitants were out prac-
tising at the bar. I made a sketch on the spot. All here is new and fresh to

CASE
those who have never seen it before, and everything on the Jarnziri-bar Coast
is thoroughly novel to those who have never previously encountered anything
of the sort.
But a great change has taken place since I was last here. All the " bars," of
which Jarnziri-bar was the principal, have been considerably altered, and one,
Dempulbar, has almost entirely disappeared.
The younger female portion of the population, i.e. the Sorcibar-niaids, come
chiefly from the Swilli Isles.
To the wanderer, jaded with the regularity of civilisation, what a contrast
does not the scenery of Central Africa offer! The eye travels upward from
the level flats to the hills, and downwards as the verdant elevations decline
towards the exotic fragrance of the luxurious meadows. Jack-boot trees loom
up with their great yellow gambogeous tops, rare gums give relief to the white
tooth-brush-wood, while, stretching away into the blue distance, which seems
farther and farther off as it reaches for thousands of miles towards the sea, may
be seen the wonderful land of U'umbugu, the green verdant country of the
Unoemas, while to the left are the extensive preserves of King JINJA, and on
the right the magnificent grazing meadows of the equestrian, but horsetile tribe
of Mijeejee.
Here all is peace, and happiness, and quiet, as the idle traveller, willing to
yield himself up captive to the beautiful visions expanding before him, sinks
down slowly on a spur of land, that makes him start up again sharplyj as
though he were reminded of his duty by a voice from the Spur-rit Land, saying,
"Squat not, but forwards!"
At Jarnziribar I engaged a native detective, who undertook to find STANLEY,
if anyone could. His name was M'Yiomrt;. Also, I secured the services of a
Dark night-porter, a Light porter (to carry a lantern when necessary), a sarcastic
native servant, who was a little porter and a trifle bitter—a sort of half-and-
half caste,—a dumb waiter, two chairmen (who would be useful when any of
my people were out of order), and three native committee men (with power
to add to their number, which I had token on hiring them), a supply of
telephones, phonographs, microphones, pocket-telescopes, a musical-box slightly
damaged, and a trumpet. I managed most fortunately to pick up a most
respectable middle-aged man, who. he informed me, had
been a Polytechnic Lecturer, and having once wandered
away from his subject, had come out there by accident.
He had with him a few bottles of explosive gas, some

magnesium wire, and a few interesting experiments of a
fireworky character still in his bag; he could give a first-
rate show of the onimaleulte contained in a drop of
Thames water (always a safe hit), besides a dissolving
view of the Home of Milton, Salisbury Cathedral by
Moonlight, Mount Vesuvius in a state of eruption, and a
comic slide of the Devil and the Baker. Besides this he
knew, from having been professionally engaged in that
line, most of the usual evening entertainers tricks, and
could do the pancake in the nat, and the ring in the
orange; while nis ventriloquism,—giving the man in the
cellar singing a comic song, the eccentric burglar in the
chimney getting fainter and fainter,—was simply perfect.
He possessed several packs of cards. At nrst he did
not much relish travelling in company with M'YIONYU,
the detective, but when he found the latter totally un-
able to discover any one of his tricks, his confidence was
restored. I made my own reflections on M'YTONYC'S
conduct on this occasion, and complimented myself, pri-
vately, on having engaged two men who would be most
useful to me, and so invaluable with regard to each
other.
The next morning, we obtained a conveyance from
one of the Jarnziribar residents, and drove down to the
back coast, whence the Arkadia set sail for the Keep-it-
dark Continent, amid the thousand good wishes of the
people of Sorcibar and Swilli, for our speedy and safe
departure.
After quitting "Wytchoka village (the missionary set-
tlement), we launched the Arkadia, and arrived at
Awagogo, where we found it impossible to stay, in con-
sequence of the animosity displayed towards our jmrty
by the chief, DONTWANTCHIT. The fact is, his faith in
us was shaken by our weak-minded Ventriloquist, who,
having a cold in his head, and a pain in that part of the
human frame where his power of speaking is supposed
to be located (ventrilocated), stupidly attempted to sup-
ply the defect of nature by a touch of inferior art.
When asked to do "the man under the table having his
tooth out" (the patient is supposed to have secreted him-
self under the table, in order to get away from the
dentist), he didn't, like a man, refuse, and explain why,
but, after considerable delay, he proceeded with the
entertainment, which puzzled the savages immensely, and
they were all preparing to "shell" out—their currency
is in shells, for which other and simpler tribes give gold
in exchange—when their chief, DONTWANTCHU, who had

been watching everything with the closest attention, made a sudden
dash at the table-cloth, pulled it off with a jerk, and there, under-
neath, was the obese form of M'YIONYU, the detective, who, I regret
to say, had lent his fat, stupid countenance to this idiotic impos-
ture. Had it not been that I, then and there, proclaimed aloud
that the money taken at the doors tcould be immediately returned,
neither MCSMTTGGINS, the ventriloquist, nor M'noimr, the native
detective, would ever have got out of that place alive. As it was,
they contrived to escape while I was explaining that, as it was
difficult to make up the accounts on the spot, the money would
be returned, if they would only honour us with their presence
next day. Observing that DoifTWAJfTCHU was making signs pri-
vately to me, I managed to give him his money back, without being
noticed by the others; and he, thereupon, quieted his people-and
assured them that we meant well, and would act honestly. They
went away grumbling; but seeing DONTWANTCHTT in this friendly
disposition, I offered to convert him on very easy terms, and to
make no extra charge if the process took more than a month—for
they were very comfortable quarters, the young women being un-
usually pretty, with regular features, chic noses, that did not turn
up at an elegant white gentleman, finely chiselled lips, and graceful
forms. I attempted to reason with him on the impropriety of having
more than one wife—he had twenty—and pointed out that my
followers, and myself, were all bachelors.
The noble Savage was furious. He made one rush at me; when
with a dexterity that can only be acquired from long practice and
a Pantomime training, I dropped down suddenly, and ne fell over
me. I then jumped up, took one leap straight through the window,
and was caught in the arms of my faithful friends outside. In
two minutes more we were on board the Arkudia making for
Snooks Cutting (so called after an early explorer who accompanied
Messrs. HOOKEE AND WALKER in the latter part of the last half-
century) , where we were hospitably received by M ASSAJINJA, the king
of the United Blakkorka and Tambourini, who lived in two opposite
corners of the promontory, the other chiefs having their country
seats in a semi-circle between the two extreme points. Would I
find STANLEY here? That was the one absorbing thought. The
accompanying illustration is valuable.

But some folks fib!" sighed Mr. HORSLBY.
"Prevent your shoulder getting kicks on,
And use my gun!" cried Mr. DICKSON.
"All sportsmen have for mine a good word!"
Rejoined discreetly Mr. WOODWARD.
"On better barrels never shone sun
Than mine!" quoth modest Mr. JOHNSON.
"No other gun has got a leg
To stand on!" boasted Mr. Eoa.
"The best of guns (to say it I glad am) 's
Mine!" said honest Mr. ADAMS.
"My gun is the best gun, confess'dly!"
Adjudged great Mr. RICHARDS (WESTLET).
(To find a word on which to pitch hard '§
For a rhyme with WESTLEY RICHARDS.)
MR. PUNCH AT WIMBLEDON.
OF course Mr. Punch went to "Wimbledon. Of course he was
pleased with all he saw there. Of course, he always is. Wimbledon
is so very like the real thing. The camp is quite the kind of place
that would be found on the line of march of an army. Were Eng-
land ever invaded, the British troops would be satisfied with
nothing less than a camp framed on the lines of Wimbledon.
Again, of course.
Now, Mr. Punch is a civilian, and can know nothing about
military matters. It is his duty to admire, and not to criticise.
He knows his duty, and performs it. He will now express his
admiration.
Wimbledon is supposed to be a camp of instruction. In it our
soldiers are expected to learn how to rough it. And learn how to
rough it they do in the most admirable manner! A great many of
the tents at Wimbledon this year are planked and carpeted, and
filled with luxurious furniture. In front of the canvas will be
found flower-beds. The idea of military discipline will be kept up,
too, by the bestowal of quaint titles upon these tents—titles redo-
lent of the very best wit of the Stock Exchange. All this is very
admirable, and Mr. Punch admires with might and main.
Real soldiers should appear in complete uniform. Of course this
rule is strictly obeyed at Wimbledon. Wide-awakes are always
worn at a right-angle, and umbrellas are ever carried at the slope.
What can be smarter than a costume consisting of a regulation
tunic, a straw hat, and fancy Tweed over-alls;* Nothing! The
effect is admirable. 80 Mr. Punch admires again!
Of course there are no idlers in the Camp T Such a thing would
not be tolerated for a second. Every man has his shooting to claim
his attention, and has no time for receiving Billy women and dawd-
ling man. Afternoon parties, at which female gigglers giggle, and
male mooners moon, are simply unknown at Wimbledon, bo much
the better. Mr. Punch admires once more!
And having said all this, Mr. Punch will visit the most comfort-
able tent, lounge on the easiest of sofas, and drink the coolest of
champagne cups. He will do this while Mrs. Punch listens to the
band, and the Misses Punch and the rest of the young Ladies employ
their ample leisure in flirting. Sneerers may say that Mr. Punch is
sarcastic, and that Wimbledon (like life) is nothing but beer and
skittles. JEt apres? At this time of the year what does anything
matter? We are going to have Peace, so why should we prepare
for War—in earnest? Wimbledon is a very charming pio-nic indeed,
and surely that will do—for the present!
A HARD CASE.
CHANNELS of private circulation are often, but not always, the
best fitted for the blessed waters of Charity. Punch ventures to
doubt whether, in the case of a Public Entertainer, so widely known,
and so long and well loved as JOHN PARRY, the appeal for help and
sympathy may not, without offence or obtrusiveness, be as public as
the popularity which prompts it.
In the course of a frugal and laborious life that most excellent of
Artists, and most domestic and retiring of men, had laid up a frugal,
but sufficient, provision for his own and his wife's old age. The
modest store had been crowned by the fruits of a retiring benefit.
Luckily, these had not yet been consigned to the same nands to
which the savings of the' Artist's life had been regularly entrusted,
in perfect, and, as it seemed, well-warranted faith in one who was
a lifelong friend, as well as legal adviser. To this fortunate cir-
cumstance JOHN PARRY owes it that he is not at this moment left
absolutely without resources.
The friend he trusted had been fooling him for years with regular
payment of interest on a principal which had long disappeared.
At his death, JOHN PARRY found himself stripped of the savings on
which he had relied for his old age, by no fault of his own, and with
no power of replacing what he had thus cruelly been robbed of.
Were it not for the proceeds of his Benefit last year—£1,200
(invested in Consols)—in addition to the small leasehold house,
settled on his married daughter, where he has lived for many years,
but which he is now compelled to quit, he and his wife would be
penniless.
It is hoped that a Fund will be raised sufficient to secure to them
the comforts required by declining years and enfeebled health.
The circumstances of the case are well known to the Rev. Canon
BUBNEY, St. Mark's Vicarage, Surbiton; WILLIAM FRITH, Esq.,
R.A., 7, Pembridge Villas, Bavswater; GEORGE H. MILFORD, Esq.,
Hill Side, Surbiton; JOHN B. MONCKTON. Esq., Town Clerk of
London, 44, Wimpole Street, W.; HENBY BHRUBSOLE, Esq., Mayor
of Kingston-on-Thames; LISTON YoOTe, Esq., South Bank, Surbi-
ten; T. P. CHAPPELL, Weir Bank, Teddington; JOHN GALSWORTHY,
Esq., Coombe Leigh, Kingston Hill; Captain LUKIS, Olive House,
Surbiton; and Colonel SURTEES, Chalcott House, Long Ditton; any
of whom will be happy to furnish information, and to receive Sub-
scriptions for "The JOHN PARRY Fund."
Punch can only wish God speed to them and their good work.
SARVE 'EM RIGHT!
A CASE is reported where a Third-class excursionist (who having
taken a return ticket, on a Bank Holiday, found, on his return, no
lights in carriages so overcrowded that the passengers had to stand,
and very naturally quarrelled and fought) was bold enough to sue
the Company for not providing "reasonable accommodation." Mr.
Justice MANISTY, in giving judgment for the Company, remarked
that " a third-class excursionist nad no business to expect lights or
sitting room." Lights, indeed! He ought to be thankful if he gets
home with whole bones, if the train lands livers, without lights.
It is to be hoped this judgment will serve as a lesson to those un-
reasonable third-class excursionists whose notions of "reasonable"
accommodation include lamps and seats.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

GREAT CONGRESS MEETING, 1878.—BEACONSFIELD, WINDER OF THE CYPRUS CUP.
"Humpty-Dumpty sat on a wall;
Humpty-Dumpty had a groat fall:
DIZZY, with Cyprus, and all the Queen's men,
Hopes to set Humpty-Dumpty up again."
So Punch, in his Cartoon, embodies the startling news of the
week which, on the morning of Monday, July 8, burst on England, like
a thunder-bolt from a serene sky, out of the high firmament of the
Daily Telegraph. Let Punch record the day, for it should be
memorable.
Tancred's Asian dreams have taken shape and substance. Our
great Mystery-Man has linked the living JOHN BULL to the lifeless
Ottoman; has bound England in alliance with the SULTAN for the
defence of his Asian dominions, taking Cyprus as a tele du pant and
place (Formes whence to command the Levant, and cover the Canal.
It cannot be? Yes. So it is. Let JOHN BULL shake himself up,
open his eyes wide, pull himself together, and nerve himself to a
sense of his responsibilities.
The trick is done. The coup is played. The compact is con-
cluded. The Plenipotentiaries at Berlin have received the tidings—
with what feelings remains to be seen. There is the Treaty, thus ,
transcribed into choice Tancredian in the Daily Telegraph, which
has been rewarded for its loyalty to its Lord—and ours—by being
chosen as the organ to give this startling "communique" to the
world:—
"England has concluded a Defensive Treaty with Turkey for the main-
tenance of the strict integrity of the SULTAN'S Asiatic dominions.
"In view of this fact, the Porte has accorded to Great Britain the right to
occupy the island of Cyprus, and this right Her Majesty's Government will
immediately carry into effect.
"Asia Minor will henceforth be, to nil intents and purposes, under the
immediate Protectorate of England, and the British Government will become
responsible for the just and efficient adminiitration of a country rick and
varied in rtxources, and vast in extent and geographical importance.
"No further Uussian encroachments mil be possible in this direction. So
far as Asia ia concerned, England and Turkey will hereafter practically form
one Power."
We have italicised the statement of England's newly assumed re-
sponsibility, the gravest fact in this agglomerate of grave facts—the
tumbling of which upon him, per Daily Telegraph, Punch is ready
to confess has taken his breath away, knocked him out of time, in

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE IMPORTANCE OF EXTERNALS.
"YES"—(thought Miss PinTcerton, as she gazed at Laura, sketching}—"I DON'T KNOW HOW OR WHY IT SHOULD BE so, BUT A
IS MORE BECOMING THAN SPECTACLES ; AND I WILL GET ONE MYSELF."
PINCE-NEZ
fact, so that he feels as if he had scarcely yet come to from the
shock.
It was officially communicated by the^President of the Council
in the Lords, and by the HOMI SECBETABY in the Commons, in
his Leader's absence—Sir STAFFORD, Punch is sorry to learn,
having broken his head by sudden contact with a window-frame—
not a stone wall. This is the Essence of Parliament for the week
—Essence strong enough to make JOHN BULL wink again, if not
to take his breath away.
As yet the news has been enough for Parliament. Comment on it
we have had none. It wants turning over and over, and looking at
all round. Punch, like Parliament, is content for the present to
ruminate on the responsibility which has been thus startlingly flung
upon BRITANNIA'S shoulders. She will hardly repudiate it. She
may rejoice in it—wisely, perhaps; perhaps "not wisely, but too
well." But she has first to measure it. Query if she can—if all
her Collective Wisdom, her Punch and her Parliament together, can
measure it for her.
Even the Criminal Code, big fact and great achievement as it
—for the Code of STEPHEN may be destined hereafter to affect
British destinies more than that of San Stefano—seems a small matter
for the moment by the side of the Anglo-Turkish Treaty. Punch
is glad to learn from the LORD CHANCELLOR that this excellent piece
of work is not to be "rushed" through the House in the dog-
days, among hurried estimates, expiring innocents, and huddled-up
arrears, but that the Code is to be closely sat upon through the four
winter months by Minos, .^Eacus and Rhadamanthus, in the persons
of Justices BLACKBURN, LUSH, and Sir JAKES STEPHEN himself, its
parent, who will see to the stopping of all holes, polishing of all
roughnesses, and removing all blemishes, and so sending back, for the
Collective Wisdom to pass, what the selective wisdom of as competent
a three as England can supply, has made, meditated, and mended.
Punch takes off his cap and bells to SIB JAMES STEPHEN—Proto-
mender, and not also, strange to say, as yet, Proto-martyr, of our
Criminal Law. He may well take on the cap of folly to him who
has put the cap of wisdom on old Father Antic, the Law. Codifi-
cation alone would have been such a cap, but this is Codification
with Amendment.
This disposed of, my Lords, with that beautiful adaptation to maxi-
ma and minima which, we admire in the trunk of the elephant, passed
from the Anglo-Ottoman Treaty and the Criminal Code to the
gravel in Rotten Row, and had a pleasant canter over that familiar
ground, on which the Duke of Rutland is much exercised.
(Commons.)—After the startling news'.of our Defensive Alliance
with the Ottoman, and our impending occupation of Cyprus—Sir
GARNET WOLSELEY is to be our Othello in the ".'warlike isle"—
the House worked off its excitement, on the Cattle Bill, which it
discussed again on going into Committee. Government has sur-
rendered its first bastion; it gives up the hard and fast slaughter of
cattle from Spain, Portugal, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden, opening
a door .of discretion to the Privy Council, but only opening it ajar.
The Council may admit the cattle from these countries on being satis-
fied that disease does not exist in them,; and that regulations exist
giving a guarantee that it will not be imported. If it does not exist,
such regulations—it strikes Punch—would be superfluous.
Mr. FORSTEB is not satisfied with the concession, nor is Punch,
though it is better than nothing. But the Bill is a bad Bill—illogi-
cal, ineffective for its alleged purpose, and really supported by those
who urge it most hotly, on other and lower grounds than they avow.
Tuesday (Lords).—The President of the Council can't or won't say
if the Anglo-Ottoman Treaty has been communicated to the other
Powers.
(Common*.)—Mr. BASING—Mr. BOUBKE told Mr. FOBSTEB—has
started for Cyprus, with the SULTAN'S firman making over the
island to Great Britain.
Morning spent on the Highways—this is weather for outdoor
airings—and Evening with Mr. EBBINGTON, in a thin House, over
the Irish Land Act of 1870, which he insists has not worked well.
Mr. LOWTHEB said he never thought it would. No more did Go-
vernment. But they_ weren't going to repair the mistakes of the
other side. Besides, inquiry would reopen agitation. Better remedy
the evils of Irish tenure than stereotype them by giving fixity of
occupation, which Major NOLAN avowed was what the Irish tenants
wanted. He says the Irish tenant will never be satisfied till he is
"rooted in the soil "—in other words, till the Irish landlord is rooted
out.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Mr. BUTT spoke with bated breath in support of inquiry, and com-
mented on the absence of every one of the ex-Ministers who were
responsible for the Bill. The motion for inquiry was negatived by
184 to 67.
Wednesday.—The stout and smiling Member for Rochdale—a
POTTER handling Conservative clay that declines to be moulded—
moved his brief Bill for distribution of land left undistributed by
will, as personalty is distributed, with due regard to the rights of
widow and children.
This is BO obviously sound sense and justice, that it may be safely
set down as one of the changes for the better that must come. It is
needless to say that, en attendant, the Conservative back of the
House is set up against it. Mr. GREGORY opposes the Bill as a
lawyer. Alter a rule whose roots lie deep in the feudal system!
It is too great a shock to the legal mind. En revanche, Mr. LEEMAN,
lawyer too, but advanced Reformer, is prepared to swallow the
change; even advocates it. Mr. WHEELHOUSE uttered, with almost
comical na'irete, his holy horror of "touching rights in real estate
which were almost, if not wholly, inalienable.
Mr. SHAW-LEFEVRE, Mr. FAWCBTT, and Sir W. HAHCOUKT, dealt
hard blows for the Bill, lawyers as they all three are, and two of
them professors to boot, speaking boldly out and up for common
sense and justice.
The Division, 193 to 157, foreshadowed the future triumph of the
Bill. Let the Honourable Member for Rochdale keep pegging away,
or rather pottering on 1
Thursday (Lords).—Lord STANLEY of ALDEBLEY spoke at length
from his brief in the case of the succession to the Jaghire of Bun-
gana-Pally—evidently a proceeding in error. The motion should
have been made before the Privy Council.
Lord SHAFTESBURY wants to know if the Government, on occupy-
ing1 Cyprus, means to suppress Slavery there.
The Duke of RICHMOND not knowing could not say. Till Sir
GARNET WOLSELEY has reported on the island, Government prefers
to leave others where it is itself, in the dark.
"Is there a harbour in the island ?" asks Lord.GnANVlLLE. That,
at least. Government might be expected to know.
"No harbour," the Duke believed, "but several nice open road-
steads," rather exposed, perhaps, but roomy, decidedly roomy.
(Commons.)—The CHANCELLOB OF THE EXCHEQUER, whom the
House cheered heartily on his reappearance with no trace of his
broken head, was bombarded with questions about Cyprus, which he
was no more able to answer than the President of the Council.
But Colonel STANLEY does know that th« occupying forcu will bo
10,000 men, 7000 Indian, and the balance English regiments.
And JOHN BOLL—Punch may safely add—will soon know the
way the money goes, in paying for them and other " incidentals..'7
Meanwhile we keep our shooting eye open, and let no experiment
scape us.
Lord COTTESLOE wants to know whether the Board of Trade can
r will make the Railway Companies reform the passenger-traps
•hich they call platforms.
Lord HENKIKEB said the Board of Trade had taken steps. Un-
ortunately, though the Board take steps, the Companies won't make
(Common*.)—Mr. SciATEB-BooTH says the Rivers Pollution Act
s in active operation. Mr. LOWTHER gives the same assurance as to
ic Artizans'Dwellings Act in Ireland: in fact, PADDY is getting
more good of the Act than either JOHN BULL or SAWHEY SCOTT.
Highways Bill cheered through Committee. One bit of practical
work scored to the credit of the Session.
In Committee on Admiralty and War-Office Clerks Bill, Mr.
'ARNELL made himself the organ of the Supplementary Clerks, who
re like to be hardly dealt with under it. Punch is glad they have
pund a friend, though he regrets it is not one more likely to be
istened to.
Colonel STANLEY and Mr. SMITH pleaded the usual plea—good ot
he public service the rule, hardship to Individuals the exception.
Hessed are the martyrs who are offered up to the public interest!
}f course it is the men without friends that go to the wall. Their
tate is the more gracious, if they would only see it. But War-
)ftiee and Admiralty Clerks, we fear, are a selfish lot. They don t
ike to be sacrificed to the public interests.
Mr. MITCHELL-HENRY, after an attempt at a count, reopened the
oase of MCCARTHY, the Fenian convict, who, having heart disease,
died twelve days after his release, under the excitement caused by
public reception from the Dublin crowd.
The jury found his death had been hastened by his treatment m
prison. Sir JAKES INGHAM. one of the most experienced and re-
spected of the Metropolitan Police Magistrates, was directed to make
an inquiry, as the result of which he exculpated the prison autho-
rities from all blame. We would rather trust the impartiality of a
calm and judicially-minded inquirer than the sympathy of pas-
sionate partisans, and so cannot regret that Mr. HENBY'S motion was
negatived by 101 to 35.
As we began our work by bowing in a Convention, let us end it
by bowing out a Congress. The Treaty of San Stefano was signed
on Saturday July 13, at 3 in the afternoon. It leaves everybody dis-
satisfied, and sows as many seeds of war as it includes Articles.
r. EOKRTON told 6ir A. GORDON that a Map of Cyprus has been
hung in the news-room, so Parliament will soon know as much aboui
the island as the Government. There is a shilling pamphlet mil
already. Punch is happy to see. Meanwhile he is deep himself in the
biography of KATHERINE CORNABO, selected by JACQUES LUSIONAN,
the King of Cyprus, in 1468, from all the assembled beauties o:
the Book of Gold, for his Queen, adopted and dowered by the Senate,
painted by Titian, and afterwards, in her widowhood, oustec
by the Sea-Republic. Into whose embroidered shoes, of purple
samite and gold, VICTORIA now steps, after almost four hundrec
years.
Lord SALISBURY is sending over a picture of the South-East as new-
limned by the Congress; two large copies to hang in the Library
and small ones to be distributed among Members.
Mr. BOUBKE and Mr. FORSTER exchanged ideas about Slavery—
which Government will do its best to discourage in the East, the
Porte having already expressed its willingness to enter into a Con
vention to stop the trade in slaves.
What undertaking won't it enter into?
Promising is so easy, and performance so hard to enforce.
Government — sign of the approaching end of the Session — means
to take all the Wednesdays, and all the Tuesdays after next.
Even with that impending, the slaughter of the Innocents will b
a bloody one*
Lastly came the regular wrangle over the Irish Sunday Closin
Bill, brought to a close at the scandalously early hour of ten minute
after three, when Mr. ONSLOW'S Amendment for reading the BL
that day six months was disposed of by 166 to 53.
This promises to be the one Irish Bill of the Session, and it 's
bad 'mi. The exclusion of the great Irish towns from the measur
of itself reduces it to an absurdity,
Friday (£sttfe).— Lord TStfKO opened nr6 6fl the Vivisection Coin

as his own.

in what follows from the pen of those Sawbbatariana' not at all over-
officious officer:—
religious ch»racter of th« day and to impair it as a day of national rest from
labour, and to teach the people that the Sunday is a day for mere sightseeing
and amusement instead of a day for rest and religious eiercises."
As Scotchmen you can appreciate the logic of declaring that to
open a picture gallery during a part of the Sawbbath is calculated to
teach the people that the Sunday is a day for mere sightseeing and
amusement, instead of a day for rest and religious exercises. You
can see how certain it is that people cannot possibly go to church,
and afterwards visit a picture gallery as well. With you, no doubt,
Mr. HILL and his employers are prepared to give an affirmative
answer to the question if it is sinful of a nobleman or a gentleman
to allow visitors to inspect his private collection of paintings on the
Sawbbath '1
Here is further argumentation after your own hearts :—
"The Sunday opening of the. Gallery must involve a certain amount of
additional labour oil the part of attendants, and increase the work of public-
house and refrelhment-houws keepers, who will be required to supply persons
who come from a distance, with hquorsr"
Is not sitting, or standing, or walking about, sinfully laborious?
Are there not six days during; which people may practise the voca-
tion of feeding the hungry, and supplying the thirsty with drink,
without profaning the seventh? And is not the seventh the first?
and does not Mr. HILL speak as a HILLEL when he says that—
"It will also be a direct violation of the religious sentiments of the country,
and of that command, read from ten thousand pulpits every Sunday, ' Remem-
ber the Sabbath-day, to k«»p it holy.'"
For are not the Sunday and the Sawbbath Day convertible terms?
and was not Man made for the Sawbbath, and not the Sawbbath for
Man—according to your Evangel? And will not the opening of the
Grosvenor Gallery on Sunday be, relatively to that dogma, what our
friends of auld lang syne call the thin end of the wedge V
A Saving in Show.
ONI: of the subjects announced for discussion at the forthcoming
Social Science Congress is, "How can Street Architecture be best
improved with ft view to Economy?" Cliiefly, one would think, by
reducing the extravagant ornamentation of shops to the modest
requirements of good taste. Tradesmen occupying premises so
adorned would not find it necessary to recoup themselves for rent
out of their customers' pockets.

AS there appears to be still some
doubt as to the origin of the now
famous Auglo-Turkish Conven-

concession, it is with much satisfac-
tion that Hr. Punch finds himself in a
position to throw full light
upon the subject. The fol-
lowing significant State

from a source as to which
he asks no questions, and
therefore publishes them on
the mutual principle, from
a sense of what he owes
the public as an organ of
publicity, and vice versa.

Sorry you don't know what

can't go and inspect them
again. It would look ridiculous. Besides, we had it dreadful in
the Mediterranean. Fact. The thine can't be done. Bring them
over to Hyde Park, if you like, and I 11 look at them there—or, why
not send them to Jamaica? Come, there's something in that, eh?

From Sir S d N e, H'hitehall, to the Marquis of S y,

WE called a Council over it once, and are quite unanimous. He

PARDON the inquiry, gentle reader, but have you such a thing as
a spare thousand-pound Bank-note about you? If so, you cannot
well do better than invest it in the purchase of a bit of freehold land,
which is offered for a playground near St. Peter's, London Docks.
The poor children there live far from anv Park where they might
play, and have no better recreation than the making of mud-pies, or
the projection of small missiles at strangers who approach them.
These little bratlings are brought up in the midst of bricks and
mortar, and know no more of playing cricket than of playing the
piano. A childhood without plav is not a pleasant thing to mink
of; and a thousand pounds in this case would suffice to stop the
thought of it.
While thinking of the matter, the happy thought occurs to me,
that the children round St. Paul's might help those round St. Peter's.
It would be a pretty gift if the children of the West were to give
this precious playground to the children of the East. Were little
CHARLES and CLARA to consent to go without new playthings for a
month or two, and to be put upon short commons as to sugar-plums
and strawberries, and were other little CHARLESES and small CLARAS
to do likewise, a sufficiency of sixpences and shillings and half-

combination, very readily be raised.

TUESE friendly people gave our party a free admission to the chief Hall, and
entertained us for two Eours one evening with songs, riddles, and dances.
To my question. ' Have you seen Mr. SrAJftW?" MASSAJIKJA replied, in a song,
to the effect that He had not seen him lately," Soon after this the tribes broke
up and dispersed, as they were going on tour ia Various parties to visit certain friendly
Bices. They were taking a black horse with them as leader in the caravan.
By M'YiolrrD'B advice, I exchanged one barrel of tunes (out of the floating musical
box) for this black horse, which M'rtoJttn had discovered to be a magnificent white
Arab, of the fleetest description, painted black as a coal. M'Yiosru. -who is of a
sporting turn, and knows a little of most things in general, but nothing much in
particular, found out this horse's true colour by quietly scratching him the night before
the start for the Dark Ptaces. I christened him Old Scratch, in- The Dark Horse.
On the second of the next month we arrived at Ippsum, the chief village of the
ureat EqueotHMj Miieejee Tribe. It was the eve of one of their Grand Annual
Contests, and seeing that they were inclined to regard the new arrivals with anything

J 0 >«.<l
but a friendly eye-^their eyes being peculiarly piercing, and able to take everybody in
at a glance—I considered that my best course would be to send in my card, at once,
by M'nojjru, the Detective, to the Emperor JOXKI.
M'YIONYU objected to this at first, as he had already become Very fat, and he was
afraid that the Slijeejees were cannibals.
He was perfectly right; they were cannibals. This tribe, 6r rather these tribes,
classed under one head, theMijeejees, live entirelu on strangers.
Still, on its being pointed out to M'VIONTU that, if they attacked us, we, being till
light weights and in good training, should be able to save ourselves, while he Would
most certainly fall into their hands, he undertook the mission, oil condition that should
I be enabled to enter the Dark Horse for the Mijeejee contest, he should stand in. To
this I acceded, and preceded by our little Devil—I mean the Printer's boy, from
Fleet Street—playing a drum, and another of our party, the oldest, thinnest, and
ugliest, carrying a nag of truce, he soon found himself iii the presence of the Great
JOKKI, who received him amicably, and expressed a wish, to see the distinguished
White Colonel," (myself,) of whom he had heard so much.
Taking advantage of this condescension, I at once donned my best pink, breeches,
tops, and made my valet trim my hair into a neat hunting-crop. So attired, I went
with a sweet smile, but an anxious heart beating beneath my bird's-eye scarf and
horseshoe pin, to the Palace of TATA SALZA, where there was a great assemblage of
13—
the
flOilW
weapons called Jokki-Kluos, made oh purpose to enforce the laws of the Miieejee
dominions.
The great JOKKI himself is of short stature, with a cruel, cunning expression in his
eyes, and a quiet, calm smile, that is at one time inexpressibly sardonic, and at another
perfectly heavenly. He wore a small cap with a
peak, to shade his eyes, and the upper part of
his body was striped Sll over with orange and
black. His nether man was clothed in a tight-
fittinr skin reaching below the knees, while an-
other kind of skin, differently dressed and coloured,
formed the covering for his feet. Sticking out
from behind each heel, he. wore a fierce-looking
weapon, with which, I fancy, he was wont to
inflict cruel injuries on an enemy luckless enough
to be placed at his mercv. All the officers of the
Court, including the Chief Trayna (his Prime
Minister), carried small books formed of thin
white leaves, on which, from time to time, they
made itrange hieroglyphic figures, the meaning
of which I was, for some time, at a loss to deci-
pher. I subsequently discovered that those who
cpidd decipher them were also often at a loss.
These Ministers were, I was informed, called the
Big B'UKMAKAS,
The proceedings at this important interview
commenced with polite salutations and the usual
courteoTia inquiries.
The Emperor JOKKI began:
"Harj/u, Kttnnel f" (How are you, Colonel ?)
To which, wath that candour and affability which
the savage tribes know so well how to appreciate
in a white visitor, I replied,
"Field-Marshal the Great White Colonel" (by
this I meant myself—one is obliged to pile it up
a bit with these people) " Field-Marshal the Great
White Colonel presents his compliments to his
Illustrious and Blooming Brother, the Emperor
JOKKI-—"
"fierttr! Eereer!" (Listen! Listen!) from
the Emperor, much flattered.
"And begs to state that he, F.M. the Great
White Colonel, is at the present moment in the
felicitous enjoyment of the most perfect salubrity,
which he hopes is the case, as it leaves him at
present, with the Illustrious JOKKI and all the
other Blooming Brethren, whose acquaintance
F.M. the Great &c. &c. has now, for the first time,
the extreme satisfaction of making."
"fiercer! fiercer.'". (Listen! Listen!) from
everybody.
To my first invariable question (for I never for
one moment allowed the great object of my visit
to escape my memory), Have you seen STAN-
LEY f" the Emperor JOKKI closed one eye, and
laid the forefinger of his right hand against the
side of his nose, as a token that he placed in me,
whom he was addressing, the most implicit confi-
dence, and to give me to understand that he ex-
pected an equal trust in himself from me. Fully
comprehending the import of this kind of savage
freemasonry, I had no hesitation in replying to
hig signs by a most close and faithful imitation of
his action, as I repeated toy question in another
form.
'Then you have seen STANLEY, haven't you F"
"The Illustrious JOKKI" (he was speaking of
himself) "will teU the truth to the Great \Vhite
Colonel."
"Hear! heat!" from me.
He bowed, not without some trace", and con-
tinued: "The Illustrious JOKKI did see STANLEY
at the Mijeejee's last Great Darbidai, where the
Illustrious JOKKI saw STANLEY for six dollars
and a half." Here the Illustrious JOKKI grinned
with satisfaction, and all the chiefs applauded
heartily.
In ft moment the fate of the' confiding STANLEY
at the hands of this crafty monarch flashed across
me. I knew, as well as though I had had the
whole scene before my eve£, that the Illustrious
(but wily) JOKKI had induced the equally illus-
trious, but too generous, traveller, to venture his
dollars on some contest of horses got up by the
Mijoejeoi (with whose habits and customs he was
unacquainted), and had beeii "put on " what they
had told him was "a good thing." The excited
(but always wily) Emperor JOKKI had shouted to
him, "Are you on, STANLEY, on?" And the
trusting, gentle, mild Afric-American explorer,
had replied, "'ies, Sir—I am on," and had been,

to use the ancient Bak language of the tribe, "Dah Yllufwa,"
which, though almost impossible to translate, means, to say the
least, "cruelly deceived."
But note the hour had come, and the Man. "Be it mine," I cried
(to myself) "to avenge the loss of STANLEY (or STANLEY'S loss)!"
But I only inclined myself politely in the presence of the f>reat
^but invariably wily) Emperor,.who nad my fife, and those ot my
followers, in his hands; and I determined to proceed in my object
with due diplomatic caution.
Presently, JOKKI observed, with all his characteristic astuteness,
"The Great White Colonel has called JOKKI and his B'UKMAKAS
his ' Blooming Brethren.' But the Great White Colonel has not yet
been initiated, by the Illustrious JOKKI, into the mysteries of the
craft of the Blooming Brotherhood. How is this?"
I explained that, as no offence was meant, 1 hoped none would be
taken. Further, that I had heard how, if any stranger became a
Blooming Brother, by the exercise of one of their Vaccinational
customs, no such Brother would ever deceive another such brother.
Was this so? I inquired; adding, "Field-Marshal the Great White
Colonel is a Christian, and never tells a lie when he is at home, and
has only asked for information, and not out of any obtrusive
curiosity."
"Would the Great White Colonel like to become JOKKI'S Blooming
Brother, and be raised to the degree of DOUBLE DITTO among the
Great B'UKMAKAS?"
"Muchly!" I replied, immediately. For I knew that to be
made a B.B. and a D.D. was the highest mark of JOKKI'S favour.
And then, remembering that caution was the very essence of safety,
I added, "If not too expensive."
JOKKI appeared pleased with my fearless candour, and informed
me that the mode of becoming a BLOOMING BROTHER and a DOUBLE
DITTO was by the curious and ancient ceremony of "cutting an
acquaintance —(here they all produced long knives, and shouted,
while M'YIOITYU turned as pale as a turnip, and quivered like a
jelly in July), "for the purpose of obtaining a good, sound, pure
red ink, with which to sign the contract; in fact," continued JOKKI,
feeling the edge of his snikkar, "by using the first sort .of ink that
comes reddiest to hand." The fees for this, he went on to explain,
were a mere trifle—nothing to speak of.
Remembering that, at any cost, my object was to avenge STANLEY'S
loss, I consented to this arrangement—which would make me a
master of their craft—and asked the terms.
JOKKI eyed me narrowly.
"Would six shellings—(the highest currency is in shells, and
the lowest in pins)—" would six shellings and eight pins break the
Great White Colonel?"
Really, I was delighted; for the amount is only a little over two-
thirds of half-a-sovereign. But, knowing that any outward display
of satisfaction would be a dangerous precedent for the future, I pre-
tended to be utterly staggered, by the amount. I wept, wailed,
wrung my hands hopelessly, and bewailed the hard terms that, if
complied with, would consign my family to the Workhouse, and
myself, the Great White Colonel, to the Bankruptcy Court.
JOKKI was puzzled. So were the B'UKMAKAS.
"Five shelUngs?" suggested JOKKI. still playing with his snikkar,
and interrogating the B'UKMAKAS with an all-round cunning look.
"Impossible, alas!" I exclaimed. "Field-Marshal the Great
White Colonel is a Christian, and never tells a lie when he's at
home"
"We wish to make him quite at homo here," interrupted the
Emperor JOKKI, insinuatingly.
"But he cannot pay five shellings to be a BLOOMING BROTHER.
and a DOUBLE DITTO. No! He is Master of his own Craft"—I
meant the Arkadia, but he didn't understand this, "and he would
rather go in for Brotherhood, without any fees at all, and take the
ink for the contract"—(here I pulled out my hundred-blade knife,
with saw, corkscrew, and gun-pick in it)—"from the veins of the
Illustrious JOKKI, just to see how lie likes it."
And I advanced, with a determined step, towards the Monarch's
seat.
This gave matters a decided turn. JOKKI, at the sight of my
knife, which opened with a startling click, jumped up, and extended
his hand.
"Stay!" cried the Emperor. "The Illustrious JOKKI will make

Alive or dead?

/would not be a Mermaid dank,
Flopping about in a Westminster tank,
Like a shabby sham at a country fair,
And by far the ugliest monster there;
Exposed to the Cockneys' vulgar chaff,
And"the learned gush of the Daily T.,
To be called a porpoise or ocean-calf.
Or'a seven-foot slug from the deep.blue sea.
Me a Manatee? Dickens a bit!
The Mermaid of fiction was something fine,
A fish-tailed Siren given to sit
On a handy rock, 'midst the breezy brine,
Each golden curl with a comb of pearl
Arranging in many a taking twirl,
Like a free-and-easy nautical girl.
Taking a bath in a primitive style
Without any bother of dress or machine,
And likely the wandering tar to beguile,
If that Mariner chanced to be anyways green.
But your Modern Mermaid! good gracious me!
Who 'd be inwigglcd away from his tracks
Or driven to bung up his ears with wax
By the wiles and smiles of a Manatee?
A sort of shapeless squab sea-lubber,
A blundering bulk or leather and blubber,
Like an over-grown bottle of India-rubber;
The clumsiest, wobblingest, queerest of creatures,
With nothing but small gimlet-holes for features.
This a Mermaid? Oh don't tell me!
It's simply some sly scientifical spree.
And I mean to say it's a thundering shame
To bestow the Siren's respectable name,
Which savours of all that is rare and romantic,
On such a preposterous monster as this is,
Whose hideous phiz and ridiculous antic,
Would simply have frightened the mates of Ulysses.
Fancy the horror of blubberous kisses
From a mouth that's like a tarpaulin flap!
That Merman must be a most amorous chap
Who would sue her and woo her under the sea,
As TENNYSON sings—a nice treat it would be
Were a Mermaid merely a Manatee!
the Great White Colonel a Blooming Brother and a DOUBLE DITTO of
the First Class free of charge! Only," he went on, in consequence,
I apprehend, of most undisguised murmurs from the Bior B'UKMAKAS,
"a trifling fee must be paid merely for the stamp
"Eereer! Eerecr!" (Listen! Listen!) from the B'UKMAKAS.
"And-if the payment is not down on the nail," added JOKKI,
emphatically, "there must be an Execution."
An execution! Was my mission to end here? Never!" If an
execution there must be," I said to myself, "it will not take place
chez moi, but "And here an idea—an absolute inspiration—
occurred to me.
"Would," I asked, "the ready money, and the reddy signature,
if given by an agent, be taken as equal to mine?"
"Quiumbo facitumbo perumu aliumbo facitumbitmbo perumu
jspimio," replied the learned Emperor, quoting an extract from the
laws of his own country in the old legal phraseology. Its meaning
is that the act of an accredited agent is the same as that of his
employer.
The document was spread out before us. The Emperor JOKKI was
provided with a formidable steel-pen, not unlike a lancet.
"Where is my Topkni?" he inquired, with a frown, but with a
side-wink at me, full of humour, unseen by the others.
Five of the biggest B'UKMAKAS dragged forward a poor half-
starved wretched-looking creature, who knelt before the Emperor.
I now began to understand the application of the legal maxim
quoted so well and so recently by the Emperor. The well-to-do
Chiefs—that is, B'UKMAK.IS, &c.—paid a yearly tax to JOKKI, which
exempted them from ever having to serve as fopknis for any of the
Imperial Blooming Brotherhood contracts. Those who could not pay
were compelled to serve in this capacity.
JOKKI now stuck the point of his steel-pen, sharply and dexterously,
into the more fleshy portion of the Topkni's arm, and proceeded at
one dash to sign the paper, which he then handed over to me.
"Will the Illustrious JOKKI oblige the Great White Colonel with
the steel-pen?" I asked.
Certainly he would. It was in my hand: I looked round for the
person who was to act as my agent, with the scrutinising glance of a
vaccinating Doctor selecting a healthy child, and my eye fell on the
fat and comfortable form of M'YIONYU the Detective, who, having
found that the day's proceedings were certain to have an amicable
termination, had gone fast asleep where he stood.
A prod from the steel-pen woke him into consciousness with a
howl, which subsided into a low quavering moan as I whispered in
his stupid ear,
"They come like a boon and a blessing to men,
The Prickit, the Howl, and the Quaverly Pen,"
and then, without further ceremony, placed my initials under the
Emperor JOKKI'S mark.
I pointed out to M'YIONYU that I should have to sign again for my
degree of DOUBLE DITTO if he did not " shell" out for the stamp, to
which he immediately consented. M'YIONYU paid the money, the
knives were sheathed, the ceremony of initiation was complete, I
was then raised a step, and the Lodge was opened in the DOUBLE
DITTO Degree; with JOKKI as Worshipful Master in the East, and
myself as Senior Warden with the chisel in my hand as emblem of

B'UK.MAKAS were in high spirits. M'YIOXYU was sulky as a bear.
JOKKI took the initiative:
"The Myeejees would like their Blooming Brother the Great White Colonel, to join in their
sports and little games."
I bowed. The hour was slowly approaching: when I should see the way to avenge

"When he's at homo," 1 interrupted, politely.
"He is at home here," said JOKKI, frowning.
"Very much so," I replied. "The Great White C'olonel never tells a lie."
Of course I merely stated this as my rule. It was needless to point out that Exccptio
pmljat re.f/iihm. The rule was good enough,
and everyone, specially JOKKI, appeared
intensely delighted, from which I gathered
that some villany was afoot.
The Emperor resumed:
"JOKKI is pleased to welcome the Great
White Colonel as a Brother. The C'olonel
has many servants, and only one Jeejee.
Can his servants ride 'f"
At once I saw intuitively his design.
"The White Colonel's Jeejee is but a
sorry black horse, and none of his servants
can ride. The Great White Colonel never
tells a lie."—I added this as a mere matter
of form which has as much force as the con-
cluding sentence of a petition, or the pre-
amble of a bill.
The Printer's Boy from Fleet Strrrt
looked up at me under his left eyelid.
Bless him! 1 knew his weight, saddle and
all, in the scale; and as to ride, 1 'd back
him against. Jfiizcppn without being tied
on, and over the same difficult country.
However, thai was my secret. I wasn't
Ifoing to tell JOKKI everything.
"Some villany may be on foot, but it
won't l)e on horseback," I said to myself,
"while I have Old Scratch in our stable.
For the Dark Horse, is a perfect picture,
and only wants to he properly mounted.
And," I added mentally, I see the boy
who can do that."
But I held 7ny tongue, and, merely sa-
luting as Senior Warden of the DOUHLE
DITTOS, I listened politely for the Emperor
JOKKI'S next observation.

'AERY ON 'IGH LIFE.
DEAK CHARIIE, I 've jest hin a readin' the spiciest case of the day.
And as in your chawhacon parts you 're n» good as clean out of the
way,
I sends yer the papers by post. You will find it a proper old lush,
Though they tips it so precious werbatim, it might make a mealy
one blush.
/don't often turn on the pink, and the rosy ain't much in your line,
But them Hupper Ten Toffs, my dear boy, do appear to be flarin' it
fine;
I reelly don't see, barrin' tin, that they very much differ from hus,
And the Brimstonites doubtless would say that, as Swells, they 're,
if anythink, wus.
Of course that's all copybook cant; life is not worth a cent without
larks,
Which women and wine, my dear pal, have hin always the knowin'
one's marks;
There is some does it under the rose, on the very extrcmest Q.T.,
But as the Great Bounce patly says in his soiig, "We all do jt!"
yer see.
That's wot I call life; true philosophy, plain, common sense, and
no paint,
But MUGGS, our top-card at the crib—you know MT/GQS—who 'B a
hit of a Saint,
Swears Society's got a had fit on, a sort of low Mtunc-Hall fever.
If he ain't a'umbug at heart, may your* truly he blowed tight
for hever.
He says that "the Cynical Swell and the low chuckling cad are jest
twins,
That the sniggering satyr who gloats o'er the tale of Society's sins,
Is the loathsomest growth of a time when our manhood and faith
have run low,
Whose heroic ideal's to perch on the top of the dunghill and crow."
Don't trunhle to all of his patter, or twig arf the drift of his lingo,
But he swears that a selfish fast fool is the stuff for your genuine
Jingo,
And holds it don't matter a toss if you finds it awell-toggcd at a
Club,
Or in seven-boh gridiron bags at the bar of a Hislington pub.
Yahbah! Pious pap o' that sort ain't the grub for sech 'ot 'uns
as me.
In course ver don't feed a Spring chicking on hoysters and Soda
and B.;
But men o' the world, mate, like us, as is game for a lush or a laugh,
Ain't pcrcisely the species of bird to be caught by such white-choker
chaff.
If a Toft has the run of the till and the gift to go in for 'igh
jinks,
Small blame to his ludship says I, only wish I could nobble the
chinks,
Jest wouldn't I go in a buster, and keep it hup mornin' and night,
With the pick of the. lush and the ladies. Oh! wouldn't I just—not
a mite!
It does a chap proud to ohscrve 'ow his tastes and his notions agree
With those of the pals of a Prince in the matter of spoonin' or spree;
And, since ladies of title seem game as young shop-gals for liquor
and larks,
I should like to go in for blue blood, and 'ang out near the Clubs and
the Parks.
So I 'm nuts on these tales of 'igh life as comes out in the Court of
Divorce,
Where sometimes, when they bile it too 'ot, even Swells come a
cropper, of course;
But they don't seem stuck-up in their sprees, and that beats any
sermon a sight,
For "breaking down barriers and droring the bonds of Society
tight,"
This may he a " cynical" tune, but it suits me right down to the
ground:
JFewas never so well to the front or so thoroughly "in it," all
round,
In polities, morals, and manner, our "form" must he surely O.K.
Since it's that of the very front rows of the toppingest nobs of the
day.
So CuAntrE, old chummy, let's 'ope as this "Music-Hall fever"
may last,
And the different classes be jincd in their love of the spicy and fast;
What a bloomin' Millenyum, hay? Which I trust as it's adwent
mayn't tarry,
Meanwhile /mean mixin' it 'ot, and no error.
Yours spiffishly, 'AllRY.

ABOUT CYPRUS.
DURING the past Week Mr. Punch has received BO many inquiries
about Cyprus, that he has been forced to tell off one of the most
learned of hi« young men to return the necessary answers. The
following are a few of the replies that have been sent from 85, Fleet
Street, within the last four-and-twenty hours :—
"A POOR INVALID."—By all means go. The very place for you.
You say you require rest and a little mild amusement. The island
is Very quiet, and you will find endless entertainment in chasing the
scorpions and tarantulas, and in dodging the fever.
"A YOTOQ HISTORIAN."—You wish to know something about
the antecedents of Cyprus. Always ready to oblige a friend I am
sure, although I should hare been better able to comply with your
request had I had the benefit of a reference library—an advantage
denied to me at this moment. However, the leading landmarks m
the history of Cyprus will be found. I believe, as follows. It was
discovered by Venus at a very early period. Then, somehow or
other, it passed from the rule of Venus to that of Venice. Othello
was the governor for a short while. It was in the citadel of Cyprus
that he smothered Desd&nona. His successor in the Government
was Vassio. We hear nothing more of Cyprus until it was given
over to the English by the Turks in June, 1878.
"Aw iNttulRER."—You want to know what are the chief products
of Cyprus. I blush for your ignorance. Here they are, quoted from
memory: Latakia, gum, copper, pitch-pipes, almonds, salt, tigs,
lemonade, and black-current lozenges.
"A SWEET Youwo THIXQ."—You describe yourself as a spinster
with engaging manners. You have been to all the English and
foreign watering-places for the last fifteen years without finding a
husband, do we think you are likely to meet with one in Cyprus?
Certainly, if you go there before the place is overstocked by the
unmarried ladies of the Anglo-Indian market.
"A TRAVELLER WHO HATES ROUGHING IT."—You want to know
how to get to Cyprus. It is simple enough. Go, say, to Clapham
Junction, and ask for a ticket for the nearest station. Well, they
will put you in a train which (after a few changes) will land you
som*wh*re near Constantinople. When you arrive there yon had
better make fresh inquiries. You can't do wrong to take a corru-
gated iron house, and a good supply of LIEBIG'S Essence and WATEBS'
Quinine Wine.
"A PUSHING YOUNG MAN."—You say that you have an opening
in fire-stoves and fur rugs. You want to know whether fire-stoves
and fur rugs are likely to be required in Cyprus P It depends a good
deal upon the climate. However, you might run over to the island
and ascertain.
"ONE WHO BOATS UPON THE MILITARY."—You say that you and
your three charming sisters follow the Red-coats everywhere—to
Canterbury, Folkestone, Aldershot, and Portsmouth. Will the gar-
rison be pleased to see you at Cyprus? Of course they will, more
especially if you bring with you your slightly commercial father,
and your very match-making mamma.
"ANXIOUS BEGINNER," and a Thousand other Correspondents.—
Your questions are so important that I dare not take the responsibi-
lity of answering them. You had better toss up half-a-crown and
abide by the result; or better, wait for Sir GARNET'S report.
Feathering the Arrow.
_WE read in the Daily Telegraph the other day that, after the
signing of the Treaty of Berlin, the German official mind was much
perturbed on hearing that the Plenipotentiaries at the Paris Congress
in 1856 used eagle quills, which were afterwards preserved as heir-
looms in their respective families. Why the German official mind
was perturbed is not stated; but presumably because the quills used
for signing the Treaty of Berlin were drawn from that less imperial
bird—the goose.
How could the Imperial Chancellor have overlooked the obvious
conclusion that the bird to furnish the quills for this interesting
occasion was the Turkey—which should by this time be used to the
sacrifice of its plumage. As Lord BEACONSFIELP would say, this
would have required no "partition," merely a " distribution of the
bird's wing-feathers.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
MONDAY, July IE
(Lordt).—Is Cyprus a
fever-nest? Autho-
rities — newspaper
and other — differ
The Government
having all its expe-
rience to gain, knows
no more than its
questioners. "On
the whole," from in-
formation they have
received, "they be-
lieve the climate o:
the island to be
healthy." As we are
about to quarter ten
thousand men there,
it might be as wel
to make sure, withoul
adopting Lord ORAN-
MOKK'S bright sug-
gestion, to ask the
Forte for anothei
island to occupy til
Cyprus is proved, or
made, habitable.
The Tramway (to
use a Beaconsfieldian
phrase) is the holo-
caust of horses. The
Commons, in severa]
Bills confirming tram
way provisional or-
ders, have sanctioned
the use of steam-
traction under proper
conditions. Lord
REDESDALE thinks
the matter wants
more consideration.
So the Bills for con-
firming Orders which
give powers for steam-
traction on tramways
were postponed.™Not
pleasant for promo-
ters, still less, for the
sinful twopenny
publics which are de-
pendant on tramways,
but Lord REDESDALE
must be satisfied, and
carriage-people don't
love the tram.
One scarce expects
to find Lords insist-
ing, against Com-
mons, on the rigour
of political economy.
But BO it was to-night. Question: Is the Parish or the Pauper's family to have the benefit of Pauper's
contributions to a Fri«ndly Society ?" Parish," say my Lords; "Pauper's family," say the Commons,
by their amendment of Lords' Bill. And now, my Lords, in the teeth both of Lord SHAFTESBURY and
Lord CBANBBOOK, insist on amending the Commons' Amendment, and putting Pauper's contribution
into the pocket of the Parish, not of his family.
In answer to Lord WAVENEY, Lord CRANBBOOK gave a couleur de rote account of the officering of
our Indian Army, on the principle fixed three years ago, after mature consideration and inquiry, with
the verv competent aid of Lord NAPIER of MAGDALA and Sir/HENRY NOBMAN, at seven British officers to
a battalion, commandant, majors, adjutant, quartermaster, and two reserve wing officers, the company
officers being natives.
It is pleasant to find not only Lord CRANBROOK, 'but the Duke of CAMBBTDOE, Lord NAPIER of
MAGDALA, Lord LAWRENCE, and Lord NOBTHBBOOK, concurring in recognition of the thorough
efficiency of the native officers, and in testimony to the great improvement of the Indian Army, officers
and men, European as well as native, under the present system. Let us hope for the time when we shall
manage to turn the native to as good account in the civil as in the military service.
(Common*.)—Questions: JOHN BULL will be glad to hear that even the Board of Trade thinks the
time is come for the Railway Companies to decide on some continuous brake-system, and what is more
important, put it in use.
The shadow of impending fate darkens over the heads of the Innocents, though gentle Sir STAFFORD
does not think that the day has yet arrived for " what is technically known as their massacre." There
will be a nice little lot of them for the massacrers when the day does come. The " survival of the
fittest" will give us a sadly reduced small family!
~ The Irish Intermediate Education Bill—that marvel of the Session—read a Second Time, amid a
chorus of congratulations, hardly broken by the protesting Protestantism, Irish and English, of Lon-

donderry and "Warwickshire. It
is wonderful what a milli
boldly thrown down for promis-
ing Irish pupils to scramble for,
will do to disarm opposition. To
think of PLUNIETT and Burr
shaking hands together, and
LOWTHEK and the O'CONNOR Dow
kissing each other over an Edu-
cation Bill!
The difficulty is to believe that
there can be any good in an Irish
measure hailed with such un-
precedented unanimity. But if
its effect be really to revivify Irish
Intermediate Education, what ex-
cuse will Irish educational parti-
sanship hare for quarrelling in
future r Nay, the smoothing in-
fluence of that oil of the Church
million extended over the troubled
waters of the Estimates, and the
Vote of £651,091 for public educa-
tion in Ireland, and of £12,817 for
the Queen's Colleges, was allowed
to pass unchallenged, even by
PAR KILL.
Tuesday (Lordt).—Lord CHAN-
BBOOK announced the gratifying
news that the JEurydice was out
of the hoi*, if not actually above
water. Bravo, my Lords! This
get * i/o K out of the hole, too!
(Commtnt.)—Lord R. MONTAGU
tried to "draw" the CHANCELLOR
of the EXCHEQUER on the rights of
interference between the SULTAN
and his subjects under the Anglo-
Turkish Convention. Sir STAFFORD
declined to be drawn, and Lord
R. was—shall we say, shut up?
Not so easy.
Mr. Bor RICK said Government
knew nothing about rumoured
transfers of Tunis and Tripoli to
Italy and France—transfers pro-
mise to be the order of the day for
some time to come—or of a con-
spiracy against the SULTAN at
Stamboul. As if a Constan-
tinople canard was likely to fly
for shelter to the Foreign Office!
A long squabble about the scope
}f the Compensation Clauses, pre-
liminary to Cattle Bill Committee.
When at last they got into
Committee, Sir H. JAKES
raised the question whether any
xceptions to the rule of general
slaughter would not be in violation
of the most favoured nation"
clause in our commercial treaties.
Sir H. D. WOLFF and Mr. MUN-
>ELLA, Sir W. HABCOUBT, Mr.
IEBSCHELL, and Mr. GOBST—a
trong legal force—supported Sir
IENBY, and the ATTOBNEY-GE-
rERAL, after getting up to confute
iis argument, confirmed it, amid
he silence and consternation of
he Government, and the cheers
>f the Opposition. Sir STAFFORD
bund himself in a cleft stick,
and was left there, after a severe
lunching on the head from Mr.
JLADSTONB, when progress was
eported at midnight.

clamour of cheers and su«n a rain of bouquet* as hai rarely been
showered on king, eencmerpr, or idol of the hour. Punch can
only recall two suoh enthusiastic welcomes at the hands of the
Great Metropolis—thou to KOSHUTK and GAKIBAI.DI. May the
popularity of this Idol of the Time be more durable than theirs 1
But whatever Punch may think of the "High Policy" of the
Lord of the Ascendant, there can be no question of the Blaze of
Triumph with which it invested him on Tuesday. This it is Punch's
first function to immortalise. Nor need he now discuss the question
which is likely to last longest—Premier's Popularity or Punch'*
Picture.
Wednesday.—Gentle Sir STAFFORD, undertaking the unwonted
task of giving the Opposition a wigging for wasting time over the
Cattle Bill, got wiggea himself. Mr. FOBSTEB, Mr. GLADSTONE, Sir
H. JASTKS, Mr. Co WIN, and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN were all down upon
him. No time had been wasted. The Opposition had taken the
rery grave point of "the most favoured nation" clause, and had, as
they Believed, put the Government in a cleft stick upon it.
At last Mr. FELL—a good head, creditable to South Lancashire-
came to the rescue, suggesting that the schedules should be thrown
over, and that the Privy Council should have power to admit cattle
from any country that could show itself free from disease, on con-
dition that the Privy Council order, and the reasons for it, should
be submitted to Parliament.
Here was, at last, a sensible suggestion, and a common ground of
compromise, on which, in spite of Mr. READ and Mr. CHAPLIN, the
CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER was fain to take refuge.
So the Bill will pass without its most indefensible provision—the
limited discretion of the Privy Council. All countries will stand in
the same position. Foreign cattle will be admitted alive, so long as
the country that sends them is free of disease; will be slaughtered
when the country they come from cannot show a clean bill of health.
The Government should thank Mr. PELL for showing them the way
out of. a dilemma—and in a ease, too. where even their well-com-
pacted majority seemed in danger ef falling to pieces under their feet.
Punch mueh admires you, ALBERT PELL,
The reasea why, h« 'i glad to toll.
'Tu that, with common stmte'* spell
You guide your party, ALBERT FILL.
Thurtday (Lord*.)—A crowd, such as has net overflowed the
Upper Chamber within record of living memory.
All suspended on the Him of BEACONSFIELD.
What a moment for this son of his works, published and public!
If his head is not turned by this time, there is no turning it!
Talk of triumphs!
And only Punch, the Daily Nttcs, and the Pali Matt Oazttte, to
whisper in his ear—'' Remember, thou art Man—as well as Mystery."
Well, the Sphinx has spoken, and has said as little as Sphinxes are
wont to say. It is not for Sphinxes to read their own riddles, but for
those who consult them.
It would be difficult for an accomplished orator to spend a hundred
and thirty-five minutes in saying less that is likely to satisfy publie
curiosity, or to answer the questions that he has set all asking.
Lord BEACONSFIELD tells us he has noipartitipned Turkey; has
not sent Greece empty away; has not left Russia in possession of all
the substantial gains of war; has not offended France and irritated
Italy; has not sowed the seeds of future wars; has nut laid upon
England an overwhelming and undefined weight of responsibility.
If he has undertaken to set Humpty-Dumpty up again; if he has
hoisted the Asiatic Turk on JOHN BULL'S back, ne maintains this
is the best thing he could have done for him, and for JOHN BULL.
But somehow Lord GRANVTLLE does not see it, nor Lord DERBY, nor
Lord NOBTHBROOK. nor Lord KIMHEUI.KT, nor—Punch.
Lord DERBY let his Cabinet Cat out of the bag—
"When I quitted the Cabinet in the last days of March I did so mainly
because it was said that it was necessary to secure a naval station in the eastern
part of the Mediterranean; that for that purpose it was necessary to seize and
occupy the island of Cyprus, together with a point upon the Syrian count, and
that was to be done by means of a Syrian expedition sent out from India, with
or without the consent of the SULTAN, although undoubtedly part of the
arrangement was that full compensation should bt made to the SULTAN for
any loss he might incur."
Lord SALISBURY took the Lords' breatk away by boldly declaring
Lord DERBY'S Cat not a Cat, but a tale! In plain terms the state-
ment was untrue. Sensation! Many Lords on their legs; Lord

GRAXVHLE at their head. "The word was unparliamentary." After
some fencing, Lord SALISBTOY substituted " incorrect" for "untrue."
Never was the lie more roundly given, or more grudgingly retracted.
He did not retract his comparison of Lord DIJBBY to TITUS GATES.
Lord CRANBHOOK, with light heart and characteristic daring, took
on him, on behalf of Government, that responsibility for tho better
government of Asiatic Turkey which his chief had prudently fought
shy of.
"Suppose that England should introduce peace, happiness, anil prosperity
into ihr-r countries, is this not a thing for which the nation may incur some
responsibility? When the noble Eurl speaks in deprecation of our taking
these risks upon ourselves, has he no confidence in his countrymen? Does
he not know that the moment peace, order, and tranquillity are introduced
into a country so rich in itself, English and European capital will flow towards
that country P • • » • With regard to the civil administration, Turkey
is bound to us. but we are not bound to her. We should have committed a
great wrong if we had undertaken to assist Turkey in the way we have, IF tot
did not bind her to good government, » • • • You pledged yourselves
by the Treaty of 1856 to bring about good government in Turkey; but what
did you do? It is a vulgar adage that 'too many cooks spoil the" broth,' and
I am afraid that what was the business of all the Powers 01 Europe was treated
very much as if it was nobody's. Now, however, under this Convention, we
have undertaken a duty which casts upon us a great responsibility; and IF
we can produce in Asiatic Turkey—it can only be done gradually—a state of
peace and prosperity, I do not say equal to the civilisation of modern Europe,
out where violence would cease and men would devote themselves to their
legitimate industries, we shall have done a work which will be a satisfaction
for the responsibility we have assumed, and we shall be fulfilling the highest
duty of a civilised Power."

All hangs upon the " if."

THE Worshipful Master, the Emperor JOKKI, then continued:—
"The Senior Warden," he said, addressing me, "has come from
the West. What has he brought with him P
"Nothing worth mentioning," I replied, being quite up to him in
the craft.
I replied, innocently, as I wondered to myself who on earth could
have told them about the " gold counters," and whether STANLEY had
really been done, or not, "but he will lay 100 to 1, with pleasure, to
oblige the Emperor, And the Emperor will let the poor White
Colonel send his miserable little Jeejee to join in the sport, and
increase the triumph of the Inimitable JOKKI."
The Emperor's eyes sparkled.
"The Great White Colonel is a Christian, and never tella a lie,"
he said—for ho had now quite mastered the formula. "Will the
Great White Colonel swear that this Jeejee of his is worse than all
the Jeejees that run in our game*?"
What could I say? Modesty has ever been my forte, and polite-
ness is the truest and most Christian policy. Should I affirm, with-
out seeing the other animals, that 1 hi? horse of mine—the Dark Horse
—was better than all the rot? Could I endanger the lives of my
followers by offending the Emperor's vanity P No.
"The Great White Colonel, &e.," I replied, "and h» in sure that

KING -JOK.W*
He went on:
"Has not the Senior Warden, White Colonel, brought any money
with him?"
"The White Colonel, &c., &c.," I returned, with my usual for-
mula, which need not be repeated here. "He has only a mere trifle
of money with him."
JOKKI stroked his face, and made, some remark in an undertone to
an aged B'UKMAKA, whom, I think, he addressed as "Old TTJIOWTTN
BARWTJX," who thereupon made some sort of remark on one of his
leaves.
The Emperor resumed:—
"The Worshipful JOKKI would likejto be a Christian, and never
tell a lie like the Great White Colonel. JoxKI'B Big Jeejee is to run
to-morrow against many other Jeejees. JOKKI will ask his chief
B'UKMAKA Prophet to tell the Senior Warden, the White Colonel,
something very much to his advantage."
Whereupon one of the ministers stood forward, and said,
"My name is TIPPXTMO. Let the Great White Colonel lay 100
to'l, in his owngold counters, against the Emperor JOKKI'S horse."
"The Great White Colonel does not understand your little game,"
all the other horses being so much better than his poor, weak, hall-
starved little Jeejee, will reach the winning-post long before his
truthful Blooming-Brother's, the Great White Colonel's horse."
"Good!" cried his Majesty, delighted, "then all my B'UKMAXAI?
shall bet 100 to 50 against the White Colonel's Jeejee which cannot
win, and the White Colonel shall bet with me 100 to 1 against my
Jeejee, and the money shall be deposited at once."
It was arranged that TIPPUMO and ths detective M'nomrr/, should
collect the amount on a tray.
M'Yioimr had now quite recovered hi» good temper, in view of the
haul, which, he knew, I was pretty sure to make, and of which I
had promised him his share, as the discoverer of the Dark Horse on
which we were going to put the pot.
Besides, he could not forget that the Mij«ejees_ were Cannibals,
and that in my success lay the only chance for him, of saving his
steaks.
Fortunately, before leaving England, I had provided myself with
several boxes of card-counters, made to imitate sovereigns, and really
just as good as the genuine article when oace you get into Central
Africa.

PUNCH, OK THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
One hundred of these I placed against JOKKI'S one
gold nugget-shell, which was of such a size, weight,
and brilliancy as to have made the Governor of the Bank
of England's mouth water.
Then the B'UKMAKAS, fifty in number, staked a
hundred similar pieces each: those who could not put
down the whole sum making up the deficiency in beads,
ornaments, jewelled daggers, pipes, and goats and sheep,
lu money and kind I calculated there was about five
thousand pounds set against my two thousand five
hundred Lowther Arcade sovereign card-counters.
It was in M'YION YU'S power to have betrayed our secret.
But had I seen the slightest sign of treachery on his
part, the merest wink to the Emperor, or an aside-signal
to any one of the B'UKMAKAS. I should have at once
given him as a present to the King, recommending him
as a man whom I had fattened on purpose, and "whom
I think" (I should have added) "your Majesty will find
very much to your taste." On the spot there would have
been an end of M'YIONTC. who did not, I waa aware,
know sufficient of the language to have explained
matters quickly and intelligibly before he was strung
up for the Royal larder. Besides, after all, his interests
were the other way.
That night I kept watch on M'noNrn and the B'UK-
MAKA, while the Printer's Devil (whom I promised to
reward higlily for his services) kept guard over the Dark
Horse.
"The sly little Cherub sat perched in a loft
To keep watch o'er the life of Old Scratch."
Of course for "Cherub" understand Printer's Devil;
but the couplet is neat and appropriate.

What next?
THE Dark Horse has won. The race is over! But
what a day of excitement! He was nearly beaten, for
the Emperor JOKKI rode himself, and he's a feather-
weight. Desides his mare being in the most perfect train-
ing. But for my excellent friend the Ventriloquist we
should never have done the trick. He did the trick.
Seeing the Emperor well ahead, and our Dark Horse
two lengths behind, I began to despair, and was medi-
tating how we could best recompense ourselves for
trouble and loss of time, by knocking old TIPPUMO the
B'UKMAKA on the head, and collaring all the available
money in the hat, over which M'YIONTU was keeping
guard in our interest, and bolting for the Arkadia
afloat on the lake (in which case we should have been
compelled, for self-preservation, to have left M'rroNn;
behind as a hostage—he being too corpulent to run; and
unless they took a great fancy to him they wouldn t eat
him, but keep him till we returned." which would be
an expense off my hands for ever), when suddenly
McSinjoaiNS, the Ventriloquist, exclaimed,
"I've got it!"
I saw genius in the remark. Slapping him on the
back, I said, "Do it, my boy, whatever it is!"
The Emperor, winning, was just passing the point
where we were standing, anxioxisly watching the race,
and a smile of triumph illuminated his ugly countenance
when, from his horse's open mouth, came these startling
words—
"Pull up! I don't feel well. Just going to drop,"
Need I say that this was the Ventriloquist's idea?
It operated wonderfully. You never saw such a scene!
JOKKI turned almost pale with fright, and tumbled off
as nimble as ninepence, pulling the animal with him.
In a second the Dark Horse shot past him, the little
Devil (Printer's) on his back, winking slily at us, as he
made for the winning-post, and won "with a good bit up
his sleeve," as we Turfites say.
JOKKI was furious. "We rushed forward to assist him,
and, under pretence of examining the animal's head, I
put my pocket-handkerchief, steeped in chloroform, to
his nostrils, and, to all appearance, the noble beast had
tainted dead away.
JOKKI guspeeted foul play, and was for haying us
seized, when the Ventriloquist's art again came to our
aisistance, for from the Big B'UKMAKA, who was disputing with M'CTONTU as
to the coin, suddenly came these words—
"JOKKI, T»-ii::i okusthe jee-jee." (Literally, "JOKKI, I poisoned the
horse.")
Immediately he was set upon by all the B'UKMAKAS, who were heavy losers;
and, taking this as our only opportunity for escape, I caught up the hatful of
money. Luckily, it had all been deposited correctly; and, jumping on Old
Scratch, with the hatful of money in one hand, and a revolver in the other, while
the boy clung on with his arm round my waist, I dashed down to the Arkadia,
where I found my party trving to put the Arkadia together. They ought
never to have undone her. ""The stupid{ idiots had got all the compartments

wrong, and such a mess you never saw. A quarter of the keel was upside
down, the bows were in the centre, the steerage was in front — in fact, I
never saw confusion worse confounded (and no one ever heard confusion'better
confounded than^I confounded it on that occasion) in all my life.'iliThe numbers
of the compartments had got nibbed out, and so we could only guess; but there
was no time to be lost. Our lives were in our hands; and as the merciful
man is invariably merciful to his beast, I saw Old Scratch well bestowed in his
stable-compartment, rubbed him down, put him in his little bed, tucked him
up, kissed him for his mother, &c., &c., and then stuck the Arkadia together,
as best I could, in five minutes.
"One, two, three — launch with a will!" I cried. And away went the
Arkadia, with myself sitting in the stern, and my brave companions shoving
the boat off, nearly up to their necks in water.
TVe were getting well under weigh when, on calling the roll (capital subject
for a picture this—never been done—I mean not with myself as the central
figure of the group), I found that M'TIONTT was absent.
A piercing shriek answered our inquiries.
He was pursued by the infuriate JOKKI and the whole tribe of savage
Mijeejees. (To be continued.)
A Chancellor's Functions.
PRINCE BISMABCK did good service as Moderator of the late Congress. Let
us drink his health. May it be improved by the trip which he has probably
by this time taken, according to this telegram from Berlin :—
"Prince BISMABCX being about to leare for Kiesingeu, Count STOLBEEO, the Vice-
President of the Prussian Cabinet, has been appointed to take charge of the various functions
of the Chancellor during his absence from tin: capital."
May the restorative effects of Kissingen render it unnecessary for a medical
attendant to take any charge of the Chancellor's functions during his visit.
A Prelatical Plethora.
No less than forty-five metropolitan pulpits were filled last Sunday week
by as many Bishops; the odd five Anglican, the rest Colonial and American.
What high-spiced divinity for the Dog Days! Yet, notwithstanding the
extreme neat of the weather, nobody, as far as we have heard, has been any
the worse for this rush of Episcopal blood to the head, or, in other words, this
determination of Bishops to the Very Rev. TAIT of Canterbury.

How the House rose at him! Was ever seen
So bright a blaze of triumph? This the man
Scoffed at for mountebank and charlatan,
The jesting juggler of St. Stephen's stage,
A fop in youth, and a. farceur in age!
Yet, as the echoes of his triumph die
On the shout-shaken air of bland July,

To mar the music of the acclaiming shout.

NOTICES OP MOTION.
(For the itte of Lord Robert Montagu.)
To ask,—
Whether the Government have had any official information of the
fact that all the bathing-machines at Ostend have been bought up
by a Russian Company.
Whether it is true that Herne Bay is to be declared a free port.
Whether Her MAJESTY has been advised to send an ultimatum to
all the Powers who signed the Treaty of Berlin, and at the same
time to define the limits of " Turkey in Asia," as reaching from the
Bay of Biscay to the Baltic.
Whether Her MAJESTY'S Representative at St. Petersburg has
been authorised to demand explanations as to the possession, by the
Russian Naval Authorities, of the map attached to Bradshaw's
Railway Guide.
Whether, in the event of Germany seizing in the Empire the line
of the Loire, occupying the Caf6 Anglais, and incorporating Bou-
logne, Sweden, and the coast-line of Iceland, it is the intention of
the Government to establish a school of torpedo instruction on Vir-
ginia Water; and, whether it is true that, if the whole British
Empire was to b« blown up to-morrow, the chances are that we
should hear something of it first.
COLLECTIVE FOLLY.
THE Leaders of the Opposition, being opposed to the Protectorate
of Turkey, design to take the sans* of Parliammt on it. There will
be no want of Honourable Members to help them to take the non-
sense of Parliament.

E, Punch, having received

"Oh, lady, twineno wreath for me,
Or twine it of the cypres* tree,"
a propoi of the QUEEN and
Lord BEACONSFIELD, hereby
rive notice that any contri-
butor repeating the offence

PLAY AND WORK.
IN a paragraph headed
"Play" in our last week's
Number, Pwu-h pleaded for
subscriptions towards the pur-
chase of a play-ground for
poor children in the far East.
When we are about taking
on ourselves a large responsi-
bility for great Eastern ame-
liorations, here is a small on*
quite at our own door on which
we might try our 'prentice
hands.
To facilitate the gifts of
.._2 those who wish to give in aid
of what is a good work if ever
there was one, Punck now
states, what he should have
stated in hislast week's para-
graph, that subscriptions for
the purpose of providing'the gutter children of St. Peter's, London Docks, with a pleasanter
play-place than the gutter, may be sent to that hardest-worked of dock-labourers, the
Rev. ROBERT LINKLATER, M.A., St. Peter's
Clergy House. Every subscription will be
a Link, later, we hope, to be strengthened
still more, between the wealth of the West
and the wants of the East.
PARLIAMENTARY REPORT.
(By anticipation.)
"LOED GR-SV-LLE.—I wish to ask the
Noble Lord at the head of Her Majesty's
Government if there is any truth in the
report in this evening's Qlobe that a Bill is
shortly to be introduced providing that HER
MAJESTY may assume the titles of Empress
of Asia and Defender of Islam?
"LORD B-CONSF-LD.—The report to which
the Noble Lord alludes is utterly unworthy
of your Lordships' confidence. (Aside to
Lord 8-L-8B-KY: '' Cover up that draft lying
on the table there!") "I am surprised that
after the experience your Lordships have
had of the reckless mendacity of the public
prints, any of you should think it necessary
to trouble Hsr Majesty's Government with
inquiries of this nature. As I am on my
legs, I may observe that if Her Majesty s
Government entertained any scheme similar
to that referred to in the Noble Lord's ques-
tion, they would not think it necessary to
advise HER MAJESTY to await the expres-
sion of any opinion from Parliament before
taking any step which might enhance the
dignity of ner Crown, and give more exalted
expression to that supreme right of con-
trolling the faiths and peoples of the East
which has now, in consequence of our ex-
ertions, been recognised as her undisputed
attribute."
MAIDS AND MERMAIDS.
PUNCH.
IN reading over my Adi-ice to Young Men and Incidentally
to Young Women you must have often noted, amongst the valuable
directions which I give in that most useful work to a Young Man on
the choice of a Young Woman for a Wife, my particularly sensible
(md sagacious lessons on the necessity of looking to her bodily powers
and conditions. As, for instance, when I tell him to get to see her
at work on a mutton-chop or a piece of bread-and-cheese, and to be
sure that if she deal quickly with these she will not be slow about
anything else. Also, when I advise him to look behind her ears, and
between her fingers, so as to satisfy himself of the absence from those
situations of what Old PAM since denned "matter in the wrong
place." Tubbing and scrubbing was less common in my life-time
than they are now, and few persons of either sex, I believe, ever
washed their skins much farther than was visible, except perhaps
now and then when the doctor ordered them a bath.
Now, however, "young ladies" are not only supposed to tub
and scrub every morning, but recommended to venture still
further into the water. The Medical Preii and Circular counsels
them to learn to swim, and says that a gentleman named MAC-
GREGOR has a swimming-class for the instruction of girls, thirty
in number, of whom he taught twenty-five to swim in six lessons
last season. I quote a portion of the above-named paper's remarks
on this subject, because they are almost as instructive as any that I
could offer myself :—
"SWIMMING FOR GIKLS.—The public are continually reminded of the
numerous contrivances, supports, stays, shoulder-straps. &c., and the various
exercises that are best calculated to prevent round shoulders, a stooping awk-
ward gait, contracted chests, and so forth; but, perhaps, there is no land of
exercise for girls more calculated to attain those desirable objects than that
of swimming. During the act of swimming the head is thrown back, the
chest well forward, while the thoracic and respiratory muscles are in strong
action, and both the upper and lower extremities are brought into full play."
How much better calculated to expand the chest is the exercise of
swimming than all the confounded " corsett," straps, and.iron frames
devised by quack machinery-mongers for that purpose! Oh, but
some namby-pamby nincompoop will object to the exercise of swim-
ming for women because it is too " masculine." Let any such fool,
then, know that as swimmers
"Females would often have the advantage over the stronger sex, as, owing
to the large amount of adipose tissue covering thcirmusclc8,nndthecomparative
smallness and lightness of their bones, they not only have greater powers of
flotation than men, but, as a rule, can continue much longer in the water."
It is, perhaps, necessary to explain, for fools' information, that
"adipose tissue " means the same as " blubber," which is so advan-
tageous for "notation" to the whale, the porpoise, and that great
sea-slug, the Manatee, which they call a "mermaid," now on view
at your Westminster Aquarium. A swimming girl would be
something more like what we fancy a Mermaid than that great ugly
beast.
As blubber, in moderation, gives Beauty buoyancy—
"It is to be hoped, that girls will not be debarred from learning this
graceful and healthful accomplishment, either through lack of baths or of
teachers. Such a practice i» particularly called for at the present day as a
set-off against the growing tendency in the ' girls of the period ' to indulge in
those literary and sedentary pursuits which are anything but favourable to
the development of a utalthy physique."
Yes, and if they have not that, they are unfit to be wives and
mothers. A husband with an ailing wife, coming home to supper,
and expecting her to fill his pirje and pour out his beer, is more often
than not told by the servant girl that " Missis is gone up-stairs to
lay down"—with a headache. Nothing like their learning to swim
with legs and arms for prevention of swimming in their heads. Now
then, you try and beat that into their heads with that cudgel of
yours—the most instructive instrument the world has ever seen,
except of course the famous gridiron of your renowned predecessor
as a political and social reformer in the visible world,
Barn Elm,, £ly,iu,n. WILLIAM COBBETT.
P. 8.—It i» on land, not on water, that I hate to see women get out
of their depth, as s« many of them are doing nowadays.
A Strike that should be a Hit.
AMONG the bad news of the week must be classed the announce-
ment that a strike has occurred in
"THE NAIL TRADE.—At a mass meeting of the nailers at Sedgley yester-
day it was resolved to carry on the strike previously determined on against
the proposal of the employers to reduce wage*. Nearly 12,000 operatives are
now out."
Whether a strike in the Nail Trade will or will not turn out
a more judicious proceeding than most strikes, we shall see. Of all
workmen, in striking. Nailers, one would think, should know how to
hit the rig-lit nail en the head.

ACCORDING to Captain TELFER, R.N., the Lazi are un-
mitigated thieves and ruffians. As their name would seem
to imply, they prefer theft to work. On behalf of the
Russians, with reference to their annexation of Lazistan,
he observes in a letter to the Times that:
"The Russia of to-day is no more the Russia of the reign of
Nicholas and of his predecessors than is the England of 1878 the
England when FAUNTLEROY was hanged."
If so, no doubt Russia has in many respects improved.
The England of 1878 has numerous advantages over the
England when FAUNTLEBOY was hanged. But it has,
perhaps, one disadvantage, namely, that now in com-
parison with then, it contains a much greater number of
unhanged rogues.
A DOTTBTBTTL PROSPECT.
BY the Treaty of Berlin, England has undertaken a
serious responsibility in the East. Let us hope it will
not prove an Asia Minor evil.
BED AND BOAED IN GAOL.
MR. WILLIAM SIKES complains bitterly of certain _" New Rules"
for the regulation of prison arrangements, by which, in his opinion,
they have not been improved. There was a time, he says, not long
ago, when quod resembled a comfortable hoipital, if not hotel: but
now it is severe, and no mistake, and no joks. Formerly a gaol was
a place for a bloke where his country found him sumptuous board
and lodging; but now the lodging is a dreary cell; and as to board,
the only thing by that name is a bare plank which you have to sleep
upon in your clothes every night, for a whole month, the first after
your conviction. To sleep that is, if you can. He once heard talk
of a dungeon in the Tower of London, or some such place, called
Little Ease, so built that you could neither stand up nor lie down in
it; and next to that about the most inconvenient of sleeping apart-
ments he should think was that provided by the "New Rules. It
might be called " Little Snooze."
Mr. SIKES understands that the present Gorernment is what you
call Conservative or Tory, and that Tories want to go back to the
good old times. So he should think. Were the New Rules"
framed by CROSS P Perhaps CROSS would like to crucify you. A
•wooden bed Mr. BIKES considers an invention on the way back not
only to Little Ease, but to the Scavenger's Daughter, and the thumb-
screws, and the rack: which were also, he haa been told, amongst
our ancestors' venerable institutions. Didn't Judge DOWSE, at the
Armagh Assizes, the other day, call it " nothing short of torture"?
Didn't he therefore shorten his sentence on two prisoners for riot and
assault as much ns he could, and give them only one month? Mr.
SIKES fully expects to experience, perhaps, in his own person, the
revival of the stocks and the pillory, and he observes, with some
truth, that a criminal standing in the one or sitting in the other is
a caution to his kind, whereas he, Iving in the darkj night after
night, tormented by want of rest, with nobody to see him suffering,
bis torture, so far as example goes, is thrown away. It will not,
however, have been thrown away on Mr. SIXES, if he, knowing that
as anybody makes his bed so he must lie upon it, will refrain from
making his own in such a way as to subject himself to lying in a
prison uniform every night for a month on a plank. He should
point out the extremity of this hardship to his associates, and
whilst denouncing it in language as strong as he likes, remind
them that if they wish not to incur it, they have only not to commit
the offences which bring them to this very'disagreeable bed.
But unless Mr. SIKES will be so good as to take that trouble, the
prison plank-bed, regarded as a device for the prevention of sleep
and destruction of rest, is not a contrivance on which its inventor
can be congratulated, except as an expert in the art 9f ingeniously
tormenting. It was doubtless introduced into penal discipline with-
out any previous consultation with medical and clerical authority as
to the effects it would be likely to produce on the mind and body,
healthy conditions of which are considered by both faculties needful
to reformation.
Still, there is one thing to be said, at any rate, for adding depri-
vation of sleep to imprisonment and oakum-picking. Unless "New
Rules" have also been prescribed for the treatment of the poor, the
plank-bed does make a difference between the Gaol and the Work-
house.
All the Difference.
"Miss HANNAY, Mistress of a Girls' School at Manchester, has brought

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

ONDAT, July 22 (Lords.)
Complaints from Lord
GRANVILLE of the
ventilation of their
Lordships' House.
The LORD CHANCEL-
LOR admitted it
wanted improvement,
and promised to do
whathecould. Punch
offers him Ai« plan.
Put up Lord STIUTH-
KDEX to speak. But
if \oble Lords will
call names, and bandy
imputations, and let
(iffloial oats out of bags
in: ths House, for
other Noble Lords to
go chevying them, it
is difficult to see how
the atmosphere in
their Lordships'
Tlouse can be otherwise than disagreeably foul,
and inconveniently headed.
Lord NAPIER AND ETTRICK called attention to
the statistics of Indian famine mortality, a horri-
ble subject, as to which it is a comfort, rather
than otherwise, to think that it is impossible to
rely on the published statements of lives lost by
starvation in Madras and Mysore. The lowest
estimates of such mortality last year are appalling,
the highest awful. Lowest or highest are such as
JOHN BULL may well stand aghast at, as he looks
back blankly and with a blush, to the hopes very
widely entertained, or at least, very confidently
expressed here, and even in India where they
should know better, that English rule could and
would cope effectually even with Indian Famine.
Famine has beaten us, by how many lengths
it is doubtful if England will ever know, even when her official statists have done their best. If we
can do no better in future seasons of scarcity than we did last year, let us not vent such lordly scorn and
censure on the impotence of Chinese and Turkish efforts to wrestle with the starvation of a people.
The best thing Lord CRANBROOK could say, was, what Punch is quite ready to believe—
"The Governors of those provinces and those under them had borne a strain of mind and anxiety which it
was almost impossible to exaggerate. Their lordships, he felt sure, would not add to that strain of anxiety. They
had done their best, he believed, to mitigate and stop the calamity. They had made great exertions. They had
been, in some respects, unfortunate; in some cases they had failed, but there had also been great successes. And
though he could not say they had put a complete stop to the famine, this at least he could say, there was not a man
in the country who had not done his utmost to diminish its ravages.''
There are visitations beyond even the best strength and the most strenuous good-will of even the
best of all possible Governments. But what startles Punch is to find men of Indian experience con-
tending that by the weight of our taxation, and the costliness of our rule, we are so impoverishing the
soil as to render famines more frequent, and the natives more and more unable to provide against
them. That is a horrible thought.
(Commons.)—Lord HARTINGTON is to have next week for moving Resolutions questioning the " high
policv " which has issued in the Berlin Treaty and the Anglo-Turkish Convention. We are glad to
see that the Government is not to be reduced to Dr. KENEALY for its vindication; Mr. D. PLUNKETT
is a challenger more worthv to strike Lord HARTIXOTOK'S shield. Even he has since altered the
terms of his Amendment from a "confident" to an "earnest" hope that, under the blessing of
Providence, the arrangements made by Her Majesty's Government may result in "the preservation of
peace, the amelioration of the condition of large populations, and the maintenance of the interests
of this Empire." In fact, Mr. PLVNKETT puts Lord BEACONSFIELD'S policy under the safe shelter of
a " D.V.," to which its worst enemies can hardly object.
Col. STANLEY confirms the report that some half hundred of the Indian force have been all but
poisoned at Malta by the substitution of carbolic acid for lime-juice. Ghoorkas are wiry little chaps
who can stand a good deal, but hardly the use of disinfectants for antiscorbutics. Somebody wants
wiggingf—if not hanging.
After a vast variety of questions, in'whieh Lord R.MONTAGU made himself pre-eminently disagreeable,
the House got to Committee on Cattle Diseases Bill, and made good way till it came to the. Irish clauses,
on which, as natural, a hitch arose, and Progress was reported—according to that Parliamentary use
of the words which implies that a stop was come to.
Tuesday (Lords) .—Notice from Lord BEACONSFIELD that the QUEEN was coming to Parliament for a
marriage allowance for Prince ARTHUR.
Lord TRTTRO, better employed than in rabid denunciation of Vivisection, called attention to the
culpable carelessness with which gunpowder is stowed aboard merchant and passenger ships. If there
is one thing more than another tor which our shipping authorities, particularly in the Thames, want
blowing up, it is for their vices of omission and commission in this verv serious matter. Unluckily it
is ships and passengers that get blown up, instead of Conservators and Board of Trade.
Lord CAMTERDOWN wanted to know what Government expected Cyprus would bring in, or rather
would take out. All that the Marquis of SALISBURY would answer for was that the PORTE should not
be the worse f»r the transfer (which Punch is auite ready t« believe. Still less will the islanders).
The Government had net the least idea what the island revenue was, or was likely to be—but they hoped
VOL. LTXV. E
for the best. It had maintained a
large population in the past. He
believed it would be capable of
doing the same in the future, and
large population meant large
revenue.
Lord GRANVILLE complained
of the secresy in which the
Anglo-Turkish Convention had
been shrouded. Punch would
merely observe that regarding
the I'urk as not merely a sick,
but a dead man, shrouding seems
a natural operation in connection
with him.
Lord GRANVILLE doubted if
Cyprus be now or can ever be
made of any value as a naval
station. Even Batoum, we were
assured by Lord BEACONSFIELD,
was scarce as good a harbour as
Cowes, with room for three ships
comfortably, and six by tight
packing. let he had hrard of
its having recently aceonuvodated
thirteen Turkish men-of-var and
a transport.
Lord IU.M.MOND gave a pungent
criticism of the probable cost and
consequences of our occupation of
Cyprus, and administered to the
Government about the sharpest
rap over the knuckles it has yet
received a propoi of its "high
policy."
Lord BEACONSFIELD said that
as to the secresy of the negotia-
tions, which ended in the occupa-
tion of Cyprus, secresy was the
policy of the Government, which
he was ready to justify at the
right time; that as to their ignor-
ance about the island, they knew
quite enough to warrant the
assumption of British sovereignty,
and would be prepared to prove
the grounds of that knowledge
also at the right time. As to
Batoum, he had good authority
for his description of the port,
and its capacity. As to the ports
of Cyprus, of course it was easy
to pick up "musty details from
obsolete gazetteers; but by this
time next year he ventured to
say they would be full of British
ships. (Very probably, with si
garrison of 10,000 men to supply.)
Lord CARDWELL admired tlie
Noble Lord's skill in answering
questions that had not been
asked, and in evading those to
which no answer could be given.
But the House was as much in
the dark as ever as to Batoum,
as to Cyprus, its revenue, its
ports, our intentions as to slavery
there, the law to be administered
in the island, as to everything,
in short, a Government ought to
have known before taking pos-
session.
The LORD CHANCELLOR re-
torted, with some heat. The
Noble Viscount complained that
questions had not been answered,
which had never been asked.
British law will be administered
to British subjects in Cvprus or
elsewhere, Turkish to Turkish,
till altered. Slavery will be
dealt with, as in other places,
"where Her Majesty's law is ad-
ministered." (What does Lord
CAIRNS mean ?)
Lord SELBOKNE complained that

the LORD CHANCELLOR'S answer made darkness darker. Who are HER
MAJESTY'S subjects in Cyprus? Will the island bo Turkish or English—under
Turkish Law or English?
(Commons.)—In answer to Sir W. HARCOUHT, the ATTORNEY-GENERAL threw
as much darkness on the subject of Cypriote Law and administration as the LORD
CHANCELLOR.
The Viceroy of India being empowered to muzzle the Vernacular Press, by
deposit of caution-money liable to summary forfeiture after warning, such
forfeiture to be followed by suppression of the offending journal on repetition of
offence, should not Parliament be kept informed whenever the muzzle is clapped
on?
So asks Mr. GLADSTONE, in a speech of studied moderation. JOHN BULL does
not like the gag. His experience tells him that the good of a free Press, with
any inconveniences it may have, incalculably outweighs its evils. He does
not believe that to drive diseases m—political or bodily—is the best way to get
rid of them, and he feels that the first condition for removing discontent is
to give it free expression. Indian law already gives power to deal with
seditious writings. Surely that is all that is wanted. At all events if the gag
is to be used in India, let those who put it on feel they do so under the eye of
Parliament.
Mr. O'DONNELL moved a superfluous amendment saying the same thing in
more offensive terms.
Mr. GORST could not see any justification for any distinction in the treat-
ment of the British and Vernacular Press in India.
Sir G. CAMPBELL owned himself in a hobble. If he had as clear an opinion
on the matter as Mr. GLADSTONE, he would have wound up with a stronger
Motion. There was a great deal to be said for and against the summary powers
given by the new law. So Sir GEOKGE gave the House three-quarters of an
hour's see-saw between the pro and con. of the matter.
Mr. SMOLLETT pitched savagely, after his manner, into the administration of
India, and the British Press there, which he described as infinitely more pestilent
than the Vernacular.
Mr. GATHORNE HARDY supported the Viceroy's Act.
Mr. SHAW LEFEVHE laughed the inflated nonsense of the Vernacular Press to
scorn. He would not strain law to silence bosh and bombast.
Mr. FAWCETT blamed the Act, and still more the way
it had been forced on the Indian Council.
Mr. E. STANHOPE, for the India Office, hoped'the Act
would be kept in terror em, like a rod hung on the wall,
to frighten the Vernacular Press-gang into goodjjje-
haviour.
Sir H. JAKES condemned the hurry with which the
Act had been passed in 'India and approved at Home;
and the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER promised that
the Indian Government should be instructed to keep the
Home Government informed of all proceedings under
this Act, as. Lord CKANBROOK has, in fact, already
intimated to Lord LTTTON.
This in effect was equivalent to carrying Mr. GLAD-
STONE'S Motion, which was formally disposed of by a
division of 208 to 152. The minority should have been
160, but for eight blunderers who got into the wrong
lobby.
Wednetday.—k close day's work on Cattle Disease and
Roads. Hard labour for such weather.
Thursday (Lords).—Their Lordships cordially con-
curred in making handsome marriage provision for Prince
ARTHUR and his fair bride, thedaughter of the Red Prince,
whom Lord BEACONSFIELD, in a happy hymeneal oration
described as "distinguished for intelligence and ac-
complishments, and for a winning simplicity of thought
and manner." For the Duke's character he appealed to
their Lordships.
"He sits among us as a Peer. He is known to the country
for his spotless life, and he is devoted to a noble profession. He
is not a soldier of parade, but of service. On a recent occasion,
when the terrible contingency of war seemed to be hovering over
the country, the Duke of CONNAUOHT was the first to express
his hope that he might be allowed to be sent forth to defend
the honour and the interest? of his country."
The marriage, he said, was "a union of the heart and
the affections.
Prosit!—says Punch, and begs to drink the health of
the charming young couple in an iced cup of a coolness in
inverse proportion to his loyalty.
(Commons.)—Less unanimous in its loyalty, the Lower
House mustered a few Intransigentes to protest against
the grant of the £15,000 which it is proposed to add to
Prince ARTHUR'S £10,000. The recalcitrants were led
by the stern Baronet of Chelsea—Sir CHARLES of that
DILKE—who thus avenges himself for the handle tacked
by Royal favour to his name.
He contended, on an elaborate review of precedents,
that there was no instance of holding out the Crown for a
marriage portion—except in the case of marriages in a
manner forced to raise Royal issue—till the present
reign.
But, as was pointed out both by the leaders of the
Government and the Opposition, backed by Mr. GLAD-
STONE, the precedents did not apply. The present ar-
rangement by which the QUEKN comes to her Parliament
for what she wants is the best for both. The allowance
now asked for the Duke of CONNAUGHT is the same as
was granted to the Duke of EDINBURGH. The country
can afford the money; the Prince wants it; the QUEEN
can't provide it out of the Civil List; and when that
was settled, it was a bargain that allowances to the
Roval Family should be given as required.
Sir CHARLES found only 33 to follow his lead into the
lobby against 320—10 to 1 as nearly as possible—long
odds, but not longer than the odds in favour of loyalty to
Royalty in the House, and out of it.
Then much way was made with the phenomenal Irish
Intermediate Education Bill—the one measure, as Major
NOLAN pathetically pointed out, on which the Irish
Members had been of one mind during the Session.
Almost as strange, they have been of one mind with the
Government. The Government opens the advantages of
the Act to girls. A queer trio—Mr. E. JENKINS, Mr.
NEWDEQATE, and Mr. F. COURTNEY disturbed the har-
mony of the evening.
Friday (Lords).—Rehearsal of next week's work in
the Commons. The Government "heckled" by the
Opposition.
First, Lord GRANVTLLE, on the authority of HOBART
Pasha, set Lord BEACONSFIELD to-rights as to the
harbour-capacity of Batoum. Then Lord ROSEBERY fell
foul of the Schouvaloff-Salisbury Agreement; and Lord
CARNARNON of the Anglo-Turkish Convention; and
between them said harsher things of both than have been
yet said in Parliament.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Lord SALISBURY did his best to parrv an attack he
could not answer. "Secret agreements are necessary
before going into Congresses, or these would come to no-
thing, or worse—to war. The despatch to Lord ODO
RUSSELL was not a farce. All we were pledged to was
not to fight for the Balkans, or for Batoum. The de-
spatch to Lord ODO pointed out the line of argument,
which actually led Russia to concede the garrisoning of
the Balkan frontier by the Turk, and the conversion of
Batoum from a war-station to a commercial port. We
did the best we could for Greece, in urging her to patience
first, and in keeping her fat out of the fire afterwards.
The Earl of MORLEY, the Marquis of BATH, and Lord
HAMMOND vied with each other in saying nasty things
of onr part in the Berlin Treaty, and the Anglo-Turkish
Convention. In short, it is impossible to imagine "a
triumphant arrangement" more severely criticised. It
is difficult to imagine what worse the Commons can find
to say of it next week than the Lords did to-night. And
the Government can hardly hope to find a more effective
apologist in Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE or Mr. CROSS, than
they have in Lord SALISBURY. Bad is the beat.
(Commons.)—Sir "W. HARCOURT baited the ATTORNEY-
GENERAJ, with a whole pack of troublesome questions
about Cyprus. Lord R. MONTAGU made himself dis-
agreeable to Sir STAFFORD NOBTHCOTE about the despatch
to Lord ODO. Mr. P. TAYLOR announced that he would
not divide the House again on the marriage allowance to
the Duke of CONNAUGHT, on which he would leave the
country to pronounce at the next General Election, a
prudent example which Mr. MACDONALD declined to
follow, and then the Houae got into Committee on the
Cattle Bill.
The best part of the Evening Sitting was spent in
debate on the interesting \subject of Caffre Polygamy,
which Mr. McABTHUB wants the British Legislature to
do away with. Parliament has more pressing business
than interfering between a man and his wives—parti-
cularly savage man.
Legal Japanning.
THE Japanese Government has appointed an English
Barrister, Mr. TARRING, as Professor of English Law
at the University of Tokio.
It would seem that the Japanese are already not
tarring, but tarred, with the brush of English Law;
for we see lie name of a Japanese graduate of Tpkio
among the winners of Scholarships at the last examina-
tion or our own Council of Legal Education.

M'YIONTU was in a perfect vapour-bath of fright—not a rain of
terror, but a steam of it, as he ran, puffing and blowing, towards the
edge of the cliff, while the savag« yells of his pursuers could be
distinctly heard in the distance.
With my usual sangfroid, I pulled out my note-book, and began
jotting down a few musical ideas suggested t>y the situation, which
was both dramatic and sensational, though, of course, on the stage,
M'Ylomru would have to be idealised into a fragile heroine.
"Fly for your life!" I cried, from my covered and comfortable
seat in Compartment 10 of the Arkadia, while still making my notes
and sketching the scene (for the Illustrated, or Graphic,—it didn't
matter to me which—<>r both) on the block that I always carry with
me for such emergencies as this.
"I can't fly I" his voice came back, piteously.
"Then, run!" we sensibly suggested.
"I am running!" he shrieked, breathlessly. "But they're
trying to spear me, and I haven't wind enough to get away! Do
stop
Dum Spiro Spear-o!" I called out to him, cheerily, as I gave
the last finishing touch to my graphic sketch; for even at this
supreme moment my spontaneous humour overcame every other
consideration—and, by the way, I really believe that the very best
bans mots I 've ever made, have all been uttered under some great
pressure of immediate danger.
M'YIONYU, however, is not of my calibre, and did not relish the
joke.
In another second the spears, flying: like light'ning. were abso-
lutely dark'ning the air. I made this joke about " lightening" and
"dark'ning" for the first time on this occasion, just as old M'YIONYU
dodg-ed to avoid a spear that was aimed at his head; but the move-
ment was not of so complicated a character as to enable him to
avoid a second spear, whose aim had not been at the same eleva-
tion, and he gave a bound that would have made his fortune as a
ballet-dancer, at the same time giving vent to so clear and high a
note, as would have secured him an engagement as first tenor at any
Opera-house in the world.
"How often," I reflected. "does mere accident evoke our natural
but unsuspected capabilities!" In M'YIONYU'S case it was his
caper-bilities that were chiefly brought into prominence, though the
impetus of a spear showed that he had only to be taught to produce
his voice to make him a second MARIO, or a TAJTBEBUK Junior.
M'YIONYU finding the number of spears increasing,—for the savages
were really treating him as if he were an Aunt Sally at a penny a
shy, with some reduction made on taking a quantity,—put up his
umbrella, but this only impeded his movements.
"Don't go without me!" he roared.
Whether we should be able to comply with his request, or not,
rested, as I pointed out to him, from my seat in the boat,—entirely
with himself.
He was n«aring the edge of the cliff, about fifty feet above the
deep pond where we were afloat, which formed the opening to the

northern end of the huge expanse of water, which I have since
called " The Great Colonel's Gulf."
"Leave the Spears, and go for the Pond!" I cried, with more
ready wit,—for I really was in the vein, and this was the third or
fourth jeu de mot I had made this morning. "Jump in!"
"I can't swim!" he screamed, desperately. He really could do
nothing.
"I can't spare anyone to s\vim for you," I replied, laughingly,
just to keep him up while he was running down; "but you 're fat
enough to float, and the stream will do the rest."
At this instant a spear whoso1 strength was. fortunately, somewhat
spent in its flight through the air, warned him that further delay
was dangerous.
"Sana arriere pensee, saute: de haut en bas!" I cried. "Leap,
pretty creature, leap 1" I added, by way of encouragement, to show
him in what good spirits we all were. And indeed it was impossible
to help laughing at the absurd distress of fat old M'noNYtr the
Detective.
The savages drew nearer—their cavalry was out—thev were all
armed—all the equestrian tribes of Mijcejee were in full force; and
the Elastic Bands of the B'UKMAKAS played their most inspiriting
war-strains, as they marched at the double-double towards the
coast.
I saw, that, if they camo on at the pat de charge^ M'YIOWYU would
be stuck all over with spears like a pincushion.
"It reminds me," I said to my men, "of the terms for adver-
tisements in the newspapers. They are making a big charge for
insertion."
They all roared, specially the Printer's boy from Fleet Street,
who enjoyed the joke professionally.
Two more spears from the advanced guard, and M'YIONYU, seeing
no further hope, gave a tremendous leap—quite a superhuman effort
in one so corpulent—and whirling through the air, anyhow,—upside
down, and downside up,—fell, with such a splash, into the water, as
to spoil the fishing for miles round, and, in fact, it nearly endangered
the safety of our frail craft.

THE £AO:LE SWOOP OP THE FAT DETECTIVE FROM "SPEARO POINT"
INTO "COLONEL'S GULP." (Vide Narratine.)
We waited for him some time, but. as he did not re-appear, we
concluded that he had been unavoidably detained below, and, hoping
to see him later on in our journey, w« set sail, got the steam up, and
waving our flagt " The Golden Fleece," in the faces of the Emperor
JOKKI and all his howling tribe, who were wild with rage, I sang out
cheerily to him through the speaking-trumpet, "JoKKl nviboi ure
Jokkidayntchu ¥" Which being impossible to translate literally,
means—" Moral: Who tries to do others, must himself expect to be
done." And I am satisfied, that, though JOKKI may forget a good
deal of the instruction which I contrived to give him in private
conversional lessons (so much the half-dozen—but he didn't pay), he
will never forget the practical Christian teaching bestowed upon him
by the Great White Colonel, Senior Warden, Blooming Brother and
Double Ditto, of whom he saw the last this day at 4 r.M. [Weather
threatening. Breeze being kicked up.]—(Vide my Private Diary.)
Next Econing.—Landed on an island. Saw a cove in the distance.
Went up cautiously, and whispered, "Mr. STANLEY, I presume P'
"You do-presume," said a voice I at once recognised. "Behold
me!" and removing his hat, with which came off at the same time
his wig, whiskers, and nose, all in a piece, 1 beheld once again the
form of M'YIONYU, the Dark Detective.
We were all very pleased to welcome him; and that night, from
his account of the tides and currents, I was enabled to draw up a
river chart, and the commencement of a table for rinding the "Golden
Letter " for the next three-years-worth of Sundays, which will be
most useful to intending visitors. By the way, who dues find the
Golden Letter, and is it any use at the Bank? if so, which Bank ? as
there are always two.
I have already commenced my Sradshaw's Guide to the Central
African Railways, with maps in special edition, and a vocabulary of
useful words to those unacquainted with the language. I am think-
ing of the most attractive names for the stations, viz., the first is
Honeycomb Wood. There are no bees and no honey, hut it sounds
well, and when you are trying to allure strangers, it would be worse
than idiotio to call one place Dryrock, another Dirtysand, another
Scorchpoint, another Phever Marsh. No; here is my list—Hunei/-
comb Wood, Slue Sea Say, Shadynook Island, Pleasant Plain, &o.
All these are good names in a prospectus, and plots of land, freehold,
will soon be purchasable. Orders for this invaluable work may be
sent to me, under cover, to the Office, Fleet Street.
(Extract from Diary.)—Before retiring to rest, I registered the heat
and took out a patent.
Night.—The camp is all asleep. The Arkadia in compartments
forms excellent camping quarters. This is the first time I have been
able to close my eyes for six weeks, and it is with a grateful heart
that I place the hatful of coin, amounting to about £5000 (English),
under my pillow, and with one hand on my revolver, and the other
on my sword (both under the bed-clothes), I calmly sink off to the
rest which I have so well earned.
One thing- I do not forget. I do not know to what amount
exactly STANLEY was done by the wily Emperor JOKKI; but if it
was only a few dollars, or if JOKKI never saw STANLEY at all—for
that sum, or for any other—then, in any case, I have amply avenged
STANLEY'S loss, and now I only long, more and more ardently, to
come up with STANLEY, to recoup him, with interest, for his suffer-
ings at the hands of the crafty JOKKI and the Mijeejee tribe. Bonne
miit. And as I drop off to" sleep, I murmur, "Mr. STANLEY, I

!f.B.—Correspondence between the Editor and the Illustrious Traveller,
which the former thinks it due to himself at this point, and in view of
future proceedings elsewhere, to publish. This Avis AU PUBLIC is not
meant in any offensive sense towards our most Illustrious Traveller, in
whom we take this opportunity of expressing our implicit confidence, up
to a certain point. But no one, in our responsible position, can be too
cautious.
From Editor to Illustrious Traveller.—Your but communication, we notice,
was dated on board the Arkadia. It came by hand. Where are you?
From Illustrious Traveller to Editor (by Messenger).—Here, on board the
Arkadia, which I am now using as a sea-and-riTer-house-boat, where I can
compile my Notes and Diaries at leisure. For reasons,—which a cheque in
full from you would cease to exist,—I would rather not land just at present.
My exs. in doing the K. I. D. Continent were terrific; and I relied on—well,
no matter. The vast extent which I have explored, and which I shall christen
New Oreenlandj will offer, to the speculator and inverter, such chances aa may
never occur again. It will be a big fortune; so put your money on the right
spot for once, and trust yours truly with early cheque. It's as much for your
benefit as my own. I'm very unwell, and shall not be able to finish this
exciting narrative for you, unless you are my doctor, and send me the draught
which will Boon set me on my legs again. Bearer waits.
From Editor to Illustrious Traveller (per Ilitto Messtnger).—Good simile
that of yours about "doctor," and most graceful play on the word "draught."
So novel and so refreshing. But you forget the Patient never prescribes
what the Physician is to send him. Aa to investment or (peculation, select a
good piece of land and send us the particulars.
From Very Ill-used-trious Traveller to Editor (per Jtf turn Messenger).—
Tou mustn't press a simile too far. I am prostrated. I can scarcely hold my
pen. If I cannot raise the wind, and get a refreshing breeze, you will h«ar
no more from Yours Truly, who is at his last gasp. Bearer (who waits) ia
witness to the shattered condition of what, pour ainsi dire, I still call my
"health." Few men can go through such trials and privations, in such a
climate as that of the Keep-it-Dark Continent, and expect to retain their
pristine energies. Coin first, plans of land after. Business is business. By
the way, Bearer's been four times backwards and forwards this morning.
Please pay his expenses one way (whichever way you like—you pay your
money, and are entitled to your choice), and give him a little refreshment. I
enclose sonic photographs,—they speak for themselves and for me! Its Voild!

SUCCESS.
(With Apologies to the Shade of Cowper.)
"BENJAMIN DISRAELI rules the world."—J. A. BOBBUCK.
I AM Monarch of all I survey,
My right there is none to dispute:
From the Court to the Cot, for the day,
The claims of my rivals are mute.
"A First fiddle" to set in one's arms,
"Eclipse first, the rest nowhere," to place!
To lead men by the nose has its charms,
Though they be of the gross Gothic race.
I am far above rivalry's reach;
My career I must finish alone;
No more meet grim GLADSTONE in speech,
The one Peer I, a Peer, may not own.
The Lords who once jibbed 'neath my rein,
Now in harness submissive I see;
To wheel to my -whip-hand so fain,
Their docility shocks even me.
Society's Lion and Pet,
Of the Hour I am clearly the Man;
Have I ought to redeem or regret
Of failure in purpose or plan?
My dreams from my own notion's page
Are translated to far stranger truth,
To be swallowed by drivelling age,
And welcomed by rollicking youth!
Success! ah! what pleasures untold
Keside in that heavenly word!
The world as mine oyster I hold,
With my tongue and my pen for my sword.*
Ne'er such bouquet-clouds darkened the skies,
Ne'er Jingos so joyous appeared,
In the light rainea from fair lips and eyes,
That my progress to Downing Street cheered.
Ye Whigs who once made me your sport,
Ye Tories who snubbed me of yore,
See me settle the Ottoman Porte,
And my party teach wisdom once more.
For the fools whose weak nerves one offends,—
The whites of their eyes they may show;
But the wise I may count on as friends,
While I 've fishes and loaves to bestow.
How wide is the Empire of mind!
Who shall dare to set bounds to its flight?
Fortune's breath against it is but wind,
Weighed with it rank and fortune are light.
When 1 think of my Old Jewry youth,
I half doubt if such changes can be,
If the ermine enwraps me in sooth,
If the Garter I wear 'neath my knee.
My fame fills the East and the West;
At riddles the Sphinx I o'erbear;
If inclined on my laurels to rest,
Of green bays I 've enough and to spare.
I 've success, I 've fools' Paradise—Place,
And success, be it solid or not,
Can even to gout give a grace,
And reconcile age to its lot.
* "The world's mine oyster which with «word I '11 open.'
Pistol—Henry IV.
A Legal View.
"SIB," said Mr. BRIEFLESS, in his loftiest manner,
"you may depend upon it, that Lord BEACONSFIELL'S
object in annexing Cyprus was to exemplify the doctrine
of Cy-pres. He could not have taken Egypt or Syria
without offending France, and wished to do as nearly
the same thing as possible without producing that most
undesirable result.

Nor likes to'rank it in the actualities:

Comes close on Government by personalities.

"CORONEK.—I must ask you to part with the animal. Ship him. He is

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SPECULATION ON CYPRUS.
MONO the disadvantages
objected to Cyprus is
its want of a natural
harbour. This defect
should be promptly
remedied by the erec-
tion of a factitious
harbour. Everything
is possible to British
enterprise and capital.
But the powers of the
most enterprising
British Government
are limited by con-
siderations of supply.
The House of Com-
mons, even with its
Ministerial majority,
will hardly, perhaps,
vote the superaddi-
tional income-tax
necessary to make a
harbour for Cyprus.
As that would be a
work of such magnitude that it could be accomplished only by the
agency of a Joint Stock Association, the constitution of such a body,
with command of the requisite resourees, is contemplated already,
A Prospectus will be published in due time, under the title of
the "Cyprus Harbour Company (Limited)." That statement will
be headed with a list of Directors, including the most eminent
names in the commercial world, and a due proportion of well-
known Members of Parliament, and distinguished Officers in the
Army and Navy. It will embody a glowing account of all the par-
ticulars requisite to demonstrate the safety of the investment. Its
promoters will look up in the Court Guide, the Post Office Direc-
tory, the Law Lift, the Medical, Clerical, and all the like Catalogues,
the names of persons likely to be in possession of small savings, for
which they would be glad of the liighest possible interest, who will
be duly provided, in the Prospectus sent them, with neat and handy
ferms of application for shares. By thia device will be obtained
subscriptions, expected to go some way to complete the advertised
paid-up capital of three hundred mtllioUSi
The Cyprus Harbour Company (Limited)," will be started im-
mediately on the revival of commercial prosperity confidently
anticipated to result from the Treaty of Berlin. The Directors will
be utterly incapable of attracting shareholders by concealment or
fallacious representation of the Company's prospects. None who
invest their cash in reliance Upon" the Company's Prospectus, need
fear to find in a few months that the concern has been wound up,
and that its promoters hate absconded with the money.
PICK'S POCKET PICKED.
IT is, or used to be, n maxim of Law that there is no wrong with-
out a remedy. What remedy, then, has MM. PICK, a lady eommitted
for trial at the Sessions on a charge of picking pockets, by a magis-
trate whose decision wag apparently determined by a purblind eye
to a pun? For the Bill against Mrs. PICK was thrown out by the
Grand Jury, and a thorough investigation of the case has since
proved the accusation Utterly groundless and false. And what
remedy has Dr. PICK, Mfg. PICK'S husband, for having had to find
£1000 bail for his wife, and pay about £240 law expenses in her
defence? None whatever, it seems, except such as may be obtained
for them by a Committee, headed by the Earl of SHAFTESBTIRY. the
Countess of RUSSELL, and Miss FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE, who "have
taken the matter up. and now appeal to the public to express their
sense of injustice by subscribing to a testimonial." But ought
injustice of this kind to be left to be redressed by voluntary sub-
scription? Have not the victims of false accusation a rightful claim
on the public for damages to the amount of the pecuniary loss to
which they have been wrongfully subjected in the public interest by
stupidity or error in the administration of justice? As the case
stands, it is not that Mrs. PICK unlawfully picked anybody's pocket,
but that Dr. PICK'S pocket has been picked by the Law.
A Cheap Pony.
WE are all familiar with learned pigs, but the following, from the
Manchester Evening News of the 24th mst., suggests a new accom-
plishment, not in a pig, but in a pony:—
PONY WANTED, 11 or 12 hands, suitable for collecting rants:
about £6; also a Trap and Harness for same.
THROWING THE SHOE.
THE Indian Troops, their European mission accomplished, are
transferred to Cyprus, whence they will probably, in due time.be
re-shipped to India. Mr. Punch has not yet heard whether Her
Majesty's Government contemplate the commemoration of their
Visit to the West by the erection of a monolith on Primrose Hill, the
Goodwin Sands, or some other appropriate site. If they do, he is
very happy to put the following inscription at their service :—
THIS IS TO COMMEMORATE
the importation into Europe
of a Portion of Her Majesty's Indian Forces.
Arriving quite unexpectedly,
to the immense surprise of Sir STAFFORD NOETIICOTE,
one morning at Malta,
by the direction of a Genius
who regarded the effect produced by their Uniforms
rather than the amount claimed for their Travelling Expenses.
They afforded to"the Weekly Illustrated Papers
material for a Series of Admirable Sketches,
and cost the Country
TBBKE QUABTEBS OF A MILLION!
Violating unconsciously by their advent
THE BILL OF BIGHTS,
and so earning, for all time, the genial gratitude
of Mr. GLADSTONE.
They were not paraded at Wormwood Serubbs,
or utilised for sentry-duty in St. James's Street,
thus escaping a Shilling Ovation at the Crystal Palace,
and possibly
all acquaintance with other new and not less startling- features
of Western Civilisation.
They obliged H.R.H. the Duke of CAMBRIDGE
to encounter the Mediterranean in rough weather,
and to admit,
in a subsequent Despatch
that their bearing was striking and soldierly.
So, HAVING MORE THAN FULFILLED
the Expectations of those who imported them,
and who. after having transferred them to Cyprus,
found themselves considerably embarrassed
what next to do with them,
they were re-shipped, quietly and unobtrusively,
to the general Mystification of Europe,
for the Land of their Birth;
Whence,
though they have merited the Admiration of Some,
and the Respect of Many,
and have left behind them
AN ELECTION CKT TO ALL,
it is to be hoped they will never again visit
the Western Dominions oi their Imperial Mistress,
who, through the mouth of Punch,
gladly bids them ADIEU 1
not Av RSVOIR!
A CASE FOR A COMPOSER.
THE plot of BELLINI'S Most popular Opera might, perhaps, have
been modified had the librettist Been acquainted with this interesting
case related in a local paper i—
"An extraordinary case of mminsnibulism is reported from Headley. A
young woman of the neighbourhood got up in her sleep on Sunday night, and,
taking a carving knife from the kitchen, went to the fowl-house, where she
cut off the heads of six fine cocks, and fourteen hens. She afterwards killed
five choice rabbits, and concluded her somnambulaut proceedings by mortally
stabbing a favourite donkey."
These deeds of a sleepwalker seem suggestive of graver incidents,
which, dramatised, and set to music, might have formed a La Son-
nambula of an intensely tragic character. The final catastrophe
of the piece is obviously figured in the heroine's concluding act.
of "mortally stabbing a favourite donkey." The analogue of
that cherished animal would, of course, have been a hapless jElvino,
fated to fall by the hand of his somnabulie sweetheart.

Is the Island of Cypnu

British Crown," or "the
'Wapping' of the Mediter-
ranean" P
Has the conduct of the
English Plenipotentiaries at

vernment have conducted
certain recent negotiations,
"_ bear the enlightened scru-
tiny of reflective states-
men?" or, "drive every
Englishman who values his
liberties to aak himself
whether the volcano that produced Magna Charta is extinct!"1
Was the\importation of the Indian troops into Europe "a splendid
and far-seeing master-stroke of Imperial policy P" or, "the vulgar
and expensive antio of a spangled circus-poser P"
Has The Earl^of SeaconsfieM "added to the prerogative of the
Crown a legitimate and lustrous splendour," or ought he "to be
burntlin'efflgy on every village-green where the true principles of
Constitutional history are discussed and digested P"
"Is The Anglo- Turkish Convention the crowning master-stroke of
far-seeing ana Imperial policy?" as the Daily Telegraph pro-
claims, or, "an insane proceeding, involving the country, without a
word of previous warning, or an opportunity for national considera-
tion, in great risks and incalculable responsibilities," as Mr. GLAD-
STONE contends.
And, ought Tht Unhappy British Elector " to listen to the violent
partisan shibboleth that is being prepared for putting intolhis mouth
on both sides," or "to take a sensible, qalm, and impartial look
round on hjs own account, and then give his vote accordingly P"

PBEACHING AND PRACTICE.
AT a medical conversazione, held after dinner, around the hospi-
table board of Sir WILLIAM JENKINS, attention was called to an
appeal to the Faculty by a daily journal, in an article on " The
Perils of Fashionable Life" those besetting "the fashionable dis-
sipation of a London season" with its resultant evils; the damage
done to the system by the giddy whirl of pleasures, late hours,
constant excitement, over-heated, and ill-ventilated rooms, expo-
sure to sudden changes of temperature, want of sleep, impru-
dent indulgence in stimulants—against all whichmediealmen were
invited to protest more emphatioallv and generally than they do
—the invitation being especially addressed to "the majority of
the busiest practitioners in the West End," who were urged "to
steadily discountenance " these fast and foolish courses.
Dr. GUINBAHAN said the article in question was quoted and
endorsed in a professional journal, which admitted that they (the
Faculty) "had not taken the subject up as they ought to have done.
Public hygiene had monopolised too much of their attention, to the
neglect of private hygiene; and they had witnessed with too much
indifference those social abuses and irregularities to which many of
the disorders among the higher classes are to be chiefly attributed."
Very likely. Their attention to public hygiene had vastly improved
the public health. The like consequence, no doubt, would result
from equal attention to private hygiene. Yes; but how would that
affect private practice P
Dr. PUHSEY.—Fancy the effect, in a business point of view, of
successful remonstrance against those unhealthy nabits, which, as
we know, produce nearly all the disorders prevalent among the
higher classes. How could doctors live, if there were no diseases?
That would be the necessary consequence of thorough attention to
public hygiene, and private hygiene, too.
Sir CUTE SHAKPLES.—The Profession are called upon to preach
obedience to the laws of health. Preaching is the province of the
Clergy. But as to that, the cure of bodies differs materially from
the cure of souls. If the souls are cured by it, so much the better
both for the souls and the sermoniser. The Parson gets paid all the
same. But the Physician's exhortations, in so far as they are
effectual, impair his income.
Mr. ABERNETHY JONES.—True; but they are effectual in very few
cases indeed. I speak from experience. My patients all belong to
the better orders, so called—those that'A-RRT styles the "Upper
Ten." I never cease pointing out to them the error and stupidity
of their ways in respect of eating and drinking, late hours in heated
rooms, impure air, and all the rest of It. What is the consequence?
They give me great credit, but, for the most part, pay me not the
slightest attention. My practice Is never at all the worse for my
preaching. In the mean time—liberavi animam meam—and I com-
bine the enjoyment of an undiminished income with the satisfaction
of a self-approving conscience.

to pass the bottle, ana the conversation concluded.

THE PEOPLE ON PALAVER.
To the Honourable the House of Commons in Parliament as-
sembled :—
The hunibje Petition of us, the People of England, Humbly
Sheweth:—
That we, your humble Petitioners, are accustomed to read the
morning papers in which the speeches, of the principal Members of
your honourable House, therein made in the preceding night's debate,
are reported.
That thosxj speeches altogether occupy as many as ten or twelve
newspaper columns of small print.
That in every paper they arc daily compressed within a space of
larger print seldom exceeding a single column.
That the debates of a whole week in your honourable House are
regularly condensed into about two _pages of that incomparable pub-
lication, Punch, containing everything in them which is of any the
slightest consequence.
That whilst it is true that a fool is known by his much speaking,
it is equally true that the Members of the Collective Wisdom con-
stituting your honourable House, are notorious for the very same
thing.
Your petitioners therefore would humbly pray that your honour-
able House would be pleased to take such measures as to your
wisdom shall seem fitting, for compressing the speeches of your long-
winded Members within reasonable bounds, which they could easily
be reduced to by being shorn of verbosity, tautology, rigmarole, irre-
levant argumentation, bosh and bunkum.
In conclusion, yr \ir humble Petitioners humbly beg your honour-
able House to consider what the probable consequence would have
been if her Majesty's Government had, out of deference to Constitu-
tional principle, communicated to your honourable House their pro-
jected Anglo-Turkish Convention. Which had they done, the Con-
vention would certainly not yet have been concluded, but would
still remain a question under debate before your honourable House,
and most likely never to be concluded at all. Your Petitioners
therefore beseech you to oblige all Honourable Gentlemen addressing
you to cut it short.
And your Petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pay.

WE TUB PEOPLE OF ENGLAND BY OUR PROCURATOR PUNCH.
OLD CLOTHES FOR CLERGYMEN.
ACCORDING to the Post, Mr. COWEN, in moving an amendment to
the Bishoprics Bill, expressed himself in terms which may be
thought to indicate some slight confusion of ideas concerning the
Ministers of the Established Church. Having said that what the
people of England wanted was, not more Bishops, but a Church
with complete intellectual freedom, and religious equality:—
"He also objected to increasing the number of a highly-paid hierarchy,
while many of the working Clergy were so poor, that they were not able to
have flesh-meat more than once a week, and that appeals were made on their
behalf for old clothes."

PUNCH'S ESSENCE
PARLIAMENT.

MONDAY, July 29 (Lords}.—A sman
little " set-to." growing out of an ob-
scure interpellation of Lord STRATH-
EDEN'S, calling attention (which die
not come) to the Convention and the
Protocols.
First those masters of tongue-fence.
Earl GRANVTLLE and Earl BEACONS-
riELD, had a bout, in which they both
showed their command of the weapon.
Earl GRANVILLE taking up the) report
of the Hiding School dinner speeches,
twitted the head of the Government
with himself abusing the practice ol
innuendo which he charged on the
Opposition. He complained more espe-
cially of the offensive personal attack
on Mr. GLADSTONE in the shape of a
"ta qttoqtte, dressed up in carefully
prepared and painfully elaborated sen-
tences, as violent, though not as power-
ful, as attacks which were directed some thirty
years ago against one of the most eminent states
men of the century."
"As to dealing in innuendo," retorted Earl BEA-
CONSFIELD, "what was the noble Lord's whole
speech but one long innuendo? If he had flung
mud at Mr. GLADSTONE, it was in return for much
mud thrown at him." (Head-Master Dr. Punch
has spoken his mind about this low-lived mud-
throwing in this week's Cartoon.) "If the noble
Earl, and those whose who act with him, think
the Anglo-Turkish Agreement 'an insane Con-
vention,' it is their duty to ask the opinion of the
House upon it, by motion. It is not by petty
criticism, by asking little questions, and making
long speeches not followed up bv motions, that
an Opposition can commend itself to the confi-
dence of the country." Perfectly true, my Lord.
Then Lord NAPIEB AND ETTRICK dealt some
well-aimed raps all round. "As for the Treaty, its
settlement of Turkey in Europe was toisettle-
ment: its changes are too big to please the Turks
—too little to satisfy the Russians; its arrange-
ments too complex to last. As for the Conven-
tion, it pledged the Turks to effect impossible
reforms. People talked of popular education for
the Turks. Why, it was not wanted; and was
not to be got when wanted. And as for public
works—where was the money to come from?
How were the Turks to raise loans without secu-
rity? Rest was what Asia Minor wanted—rest
from the tax-gatherer, from the recruiting-
officer, from the task-master • and the best thing
we could do for her would be to multiply and
improve our consuls: to send her as many sol-
diers as possible, and with experience of Indian
work. See what had been done in the Lebanon.
He did not object to our guaranteeing the Turkish
frontier. It would tend to keep Russia quiet.
As for pur having concluded a separate Conven-
tion, joint Agreements were usually dead letters.
As for_the secresy observed in the matter, that
was quite right, and in accordance with precedent.
Lord PALMERSTON stole just such a march on the
French in the Treaty of 1840."
Lord RIPON was generally critical. The Treaty
of {Berlin gave up the defences of Turkey to
Russia, and tended to provoke the war or the
future, in which the Convention bound JOHN BTTLL to take part. If the Convention was not "insane," it was one of the most dangerous
and unwise engagements ever entered into by an English Minister. It was said to be the duty of the Opposition to attack the Govern-
ment by specific motion. But how could they do that when the Government policy was kept dark till it was too late to oppose it?
The Marquis of SALISBURY reiterated his leader's complaint of the Opposition's desultory discussions, raised without the regular Par-
iamentary equipment of a notice in their foreheads, and a motion in their tails. Englishmen will never tolerate Russian supremacy
on the Euphrates and the Tigris. The Convention tells Russia so in plain terms. To do this is to diminish, not to increase, the re-
sponsibilities of Great Britain, and to give plainness and frankness to British diplomacy. The European concert of 1856 has ended in a
charivari: our more definite engagements are likely to be better kept.
Lord CARDWELL felt it was hard to bully the Opposition for asking questions, so long as they could not get answers. To be sure it was
very kind of Lord BEACONSFIELD to teach his opponents, after he had so successfully educated his own party.
Lord CRANBROOK said the Opposition was very ready to blame all the Government had done, but why didn't they tell the country
vhat they think ought to be done? We don't expect to turn Asia Minor into a Garden of Eden; but we think improvement is wanted
;here; we think improvement is possible; and we mean to help it forward. Criticism is all very well, but it is not a policy, and it
won't re-make a party.
After a few passing remarks from Lord ABERDAEE, Lord HAMMOND, and the LOUD CHANCELLOR, and a last word from Lord

A DILEMMA.

Brown (who always stammers when at all excited). "HE WON'T B-B-BITE nut, SIR! HE'LL ONLY SCJ-Q-Q-CJUEEZE HIM A LITTLE!"

STRATHEDEN—who, we are sorry to find, has no confidence in Aus-
tria, which, no douht, will at once put up the national shutters —
their Lordships rose, after an unusually lively evening, at the un-
usually late hour of twenty-five minutes to nine.
(Commons.)—In the meantime, the Commons had heen having its
go in at the same little game, but in less lively fashion.
Here the match was opened in regular form with a motion in the
cool hands of Lord HABTINGTON. His indictment had been carefully
drawn. Thankfulness for peace comes first; then satisfaction with
the extension of liberty and self-government to parts of European
Turkey; then regrets at the treatment of Greece; protest against
the extension of our military liabilities by the Convention, and dis-
claimer of the responsibilities it imposes without indicating means
to meet them, and all behind the back of Parliament.
The head of the Opposition deserves full credit for supporting the
counts of his indictment temperately, clearly, and forcibly. But if
Lord HARTKTGTON was dull—as Punch is afraid he must admit—what
word shall he find for the tediousness Mr. PLTTKKET bestowed on the
House in support of his amendment, expressing thankfulness for
peace, and earnest hope that under Divine Providence the Govern-
ment arrangement will avail to preserve peace, to ameliorate the
condition of large populations in the East, and to maintain the
interests of this Empire?
"And so say all of us." You could not say fairer, Mr. PLTTNKET,
or flatter. If a man's soul for his cause is to be gauged by the spirit
of his pleading, your heart is but half in yours.
Sir CHARLES DUKE gave some spice to the debate. He thought
it an insane Convention if it meant anything, but did it mean any-
thing? He put very strongly the case for the Greeks, and against
the Government that had thrown them over. Any effect our policy
might have had had been destroyed by the clandestine character of
the Convention. The Opposition were m a cleft stick. If they said
Government had saddled the country with enormous responsibilities,
they were told that those responsibilities meant nothing. If they
treated the hopes reared on the Convention as illusory, they were
assured nothing could be more solid and serious. He, for one, did
not think our responsibilities light.
"He believed that we had displaced the centre of gravity of the British
Empire towards the East, and entered upon a course which, if persevered in,
must lead to England becoming a sort of rich dependency upon the Indian,
Imperial, and Military Crown."
Then the House emptied for dinner, and Mr. BAlLLlE-CocirRANE
delivered to a select House of seven a discourse worthy of his con-
centrated audience.
Mr. ASHLEY followed, too good a talker for dinner-time, and then,
after an intermezzo by Mr.ll. PLUNKETT, Mr. GRANT DUFF spoke
the speech of the evening—if not, indeed, of the debate—for pith,
point, and sense pregnant with knowledge. He dealt with the
Government policy from four parts of view. First, its effect on
Turkey in Europe-y-dismemberment now, and defeneelessness in the
future. Then for its effect on Turkey in Asia:—
"The Anglo-Turkish Convention either meant nothing, or it meant some-
thing. If it meant nothing, it was altogether an imposture; if it meant some-
thing, it was well nigh an impossibility."
Then, as to the effect on Europe at large—
"Russia, of course, hated us cordially, and was biding her time. Austria
was pleased or acquiescent. Germany thought we were what we always were
—clever traders on high principles, with a weather-eye open to commercial
results. France was persuaded tnatper/ideAliion was as ever perfide Albion;
and Italy, where, for a long time back there had been more popular sympathy
for England than in any other European country, was thoroughly disgusted,
and said that the pens with which the Berlin Treaty was signed were taken
from the wings of four vultures, one Turkey, and two geeie."
(Punch himself could not have put it better.) Lastly, as to the
Constitutional question—
"No one doubted that the Crown had full power to conclude treaties with-
out consulting Parliament, but that was a doctrine which wise Ministers
would not push to its logical citremity. Our Constitution was good for
nothing, if it was permitted Ministers, without the consent of Parliament, not

'NOW, SIR! UXPEttSTANU THAT YOU ARE NOT CAVALRY AT ALL.
[Stout Colonel dots not feel the rigid man in. the right place.
merely to conclude an ordinary or even extraordinary Treaty, but to utterly
revolutionise the whole policy of the Empire. That was what the Convention
did, if it did anything, and was not a mere deliberate deceit practised on
Turkey, on England, and on Europe."
Mr. Boi'KKK laboured, with intolerable long-windedness. to prove
that the Plenipotentiaries had made the best of their bad bargain
at. Berlin, and that the obligations of the Convention were con-
ditional on the Turk setting his house in order—whercunto we had
undertaken only to advise him well and to assist him morally.
Before Lord S.VNDON moved the adjournment of the Debate, Mr.
GREENE appealed pathetically to the House to cut short >yhat he felt
to be the dullest debate he ever remembered. Punch is bound to
agree with his friend GREENE. So it was. thus far. But on
Tuesday matters looked tip—not in the (Lords) where Lord TRURO
complained, not without too good grounds, of the inefficiency of the
Metropolitan Police, protective and detective, and was met, not as con-
clusively as Punch could have wished, by Lord ABEKDARE and Earl
BEAUCHAMP—but in the (Commons], where, after Lord SANDON had
painted a couleur-de-rose picture of Turks in Asia tinder the Conven-
tion, with a background of schools, steam-ploughs, and smiling
Arcadian fields, bright enough for the Realms of Delight in a Drury
Lane Pantomime, Mr. GLADSTONE sounded the war-whoop in one of
his most vigorous orations of two hours and a quarter. It would
be idle in Mr. Punch to attempt compression, impertinent in him to
adventure paraphrase, or still more, persiflage, of an impeachment
of the Government policy which evidently came hot from the heart
and head of the speaker. JOHN BULL must summarise this for him-
self.
Mr. GLADSTONE referred to the painful subject of this weekjs
Cartoon, and read his own letter demanding explanations of his
assailant, in a style of even superfluously elaborate courtesy. Punch
is sorry to flnd that Lord BEACONSFIELD has not thought flt to follow
his rival's lead. Those who wish to read the strongest that can be
said against the "peace with honour" which Lord BEACONSFIELD
claims to have brought us from Berlin, may be referred to the
Liebig's Essence of GRANT DUFF'S Monday speech, and the full
flowing torrent of Mr. GLADSTONE'S Tuesday onslaught. It is an
indictment of Lord BEACONSFLELD for high crime and misdemeanour
against the Constitution — a charge against the Government of
having struck at the rights of Parliament, winding up with solemn
utterance of a fear that
"The result of these operations of the Government—I will not give them a
less respectful name—is likely to be an increase of responsibility, no addition,
but rather a diminution of our strength, loss of respect abroad, with a
shock to Constitutional instincts at home, and an augmentation of burdens
on the back of a too-confiding people."
Xlnluckily, Parliament and the public, for the present, seem to like it.
SIDEHOTTOM, after GLADSTONE, sounds in reading, as it sounded
in hearing, comical.
Mr. CKO.SS, the other great gun of the night, lired, if he did not
aim, low, and was altogether unusually under Cuoss mark. The
debate, though it had the aid of Mr. 0. MOROAN, and Mr. STAJJSFEI.D,
and the more questionable support of Messrs. BIKI.KV and Gor.DXEV,
languished and died down in the socket, at an earlier hour than
pleased Major XOLAN, with a promise from Mr. LO\VE to give it a
lillip at its reopening on Thursday.
(Wednesday.}—Was given up to the Duke of CONNAUGTTT'R Allow-
ance, against which Mr. PLIMSOLL,—who considers himself released
from his obligations to the Crown by the prerogative claimed for
Her MAJESTV—
"To pledge the lives and property of her people to the most unlimited
extent, not only without the consent of the nation, but without its knowledge,
as in the case of the recent Convention with Turkey,"
voted with twelve more Intninsigentes.
Mr. FOHSTER, who knows he will have to render an account of
his vote to a popular constituency, explained that he voted for the
Allowance, because if we have a Monarch, that Monarch must be
maintained in a position suitable to Royal rank; because the incomes
of the Q.UF.EN and her family are small compared with great
English incomes; but more than all, because an agreement was
entered into at the beginning of the reign that these allowances
should be given.
But Punch wishes to note that the two working-men representa-
tives of working-men spoke strongly, though soberly, and voted,
against the Allowance. It is evident that the present arrangements
as to allowances to the Royal Family would be the better for over-
hauling, as soon as present understandings run out.
The Cattle Diseases Bill was passed through Committee. A good
riddance of a bad business. And the Bishoprics Bill was talked out,
after a vehement "JWo Episcopari" (translation—"I don't wont to be
bishoped"), from Mr. COWEN and Mr. E. JENKINS, a protest from

Mr. SULLIVAN and Mr. RICHARD against legislating for the Church in
the llouse of Commons, and a plea for the Bill from Mr. CROSS,
showing a good case in favour of allowing self-sacrificing bishops
and devout Churchmen to reduce old over-sees and provide for new
overseers out of their superfluity.
Thursday (Lords}.—Lord CARNARVON protested against Lord
BEACONSFIELD'S imputation on him of having stuck to the Cabinet
till it came to a prospect of fighting, and then having bolted. Lord
BEACONSFIELD clinched the imputation in an elaborate statement.
All depends on how you look at things. Lord CARNARVON and
Lord DEBUT worked for Peace and hoped for Peace. When, in spite
of their hopes and their efforts, they saw the country brought to
the edge of War, they protested, and parted company with Lord
BEACONSFIELD. Lord B. puts this in the unpleasantest way. Lords
C. and D. want it put in the plcasantest way tor them. Naturally, the
two views don't harmonise. Time must determine whether B., or C.
and D., deserve to stand A 1. For the moment, the turn of the
political wheel has distributed 11. into the right box, and C. and 1).
into the wrong.
(Comment.)—The chiefs of the battle to-night may be classed
as—High (Lord JOHN MANNERS); Lowe (in proprid persona);
Jack (Mr. CHAMBERLAIN); and the Game (Sir J. HAY, Messrs.
HOLUES and STATELET HILL, Alderman COTTON, Major NOLAN,
Mr. BALFOUH. and Mr. LAINO, Mr. C. LEWIS, and Sit J. LUBHOCR.)
Mr. LOWE has seldom been more effective. Perhaps because his
points stand out in sharp contrast with MANNERS. He delivered
a series of biting epigrams on Turkey in Europe dismembered;
Greece sold; England professing to act impartially, with a secret
Agreement in one pocket, and a secret Convention in the other i
the "little game with Lord Olio; the serious responsibilities
of the Convention; the burden of Cyprus • the absurdity of pre-
paring a defence against an impossible attack; the moral of Rome's
decline and fall; and the straining of the Constitution and giving the
go-by to the House of Commons. The QUEEN has the prerogative
of treaty-malung; no doubt, and so—
"The QUEBX has the prerogative of mercy, and could let loose every felon
now confined in her gaols without anybody having the right to say anything
against it: the QUEEN has a right to make treaties, and she could make a
treaty coding the lele of Wight to France without any one having the right
to object; the QUEEN is the fountain of honour, and she could make an earl of
every cobbler in London if she thought fit, equally without any person having
the fight to object."
But we are satisfied she won't do anything of the kind, and so we
sit at ease with the prerogative hanging over our heads.
Lord JOHN MANNERS, in reply to this rude shower of sharp-pointed
shafts, harped tunefully on the Imperial string. The ^British
Lion was once more in his old form, and JOHN BULL rejoiced in him,
and was willing to pay the bill.
The Treaty has made Turkey strong and England influential. The
Convention has but given the Sultan a guarantee conditional on im-
provement. Improvement is possible; and we can help it. We have
done nothing to strain the Constitution.
"When he says the prerogative of the Crowu in making treaties has
hitherto been safeguarded by the cornl uct and character of the Ministers who
have advised it, and it has been so maintained because the Ministers of the
Crown have had a knowledge of the sentiments of the people, I tell him it
is precisely because this Government have had knowledge of the prevalent
sentiment of the people of England that we are here (pointing to the Treasury
Bench), and he is there."
It is a collision, said Lord JOHN, of Imperial policy and counter-
policy, the latter
"—a policy which, if I understand it, is one of insular isolation and calculat-
ing selfishness—a policy shrinking from all risks, refusing all responsibilities for
the future, and probably ending in failing to discharge those which are still
admitted; and a policy which in the course of long years has made England
a great and glorious empire—a policy which in a just cause and for noble
objects will not shrink from risk and will not avoid responsibility—a policy
which, as we believe and hope, if carried out, will bestow on the regions of
Asiatic Turkey some at least of those blessings which America, Australasia,
South Africa, and India have loved to associate with western civilisation and
the glory of England."
Very well perorated, my Lord. That is very much how the
British public is willing to have it put, just now—till the bill comes,
and the balance has to be struck between anticipation and achieve-
ment.
Friday.—The last day of the week's weary battle—the four nights
of great cry over spilt milk and little wool, though intolerable
length of yarn. Lord ELCHO, Mr. FOBSTER, Sir W. HARCOUHT, and
Mr. ROEBTJCX, protagonists, with Sir STAFFORD for a stopper over
all. Division, in a crowded House, 338 to 195.
So the Government has its triumph, and the Opposition has had
its say. Events must and will decide between the two parties and
the two policies.

ANGELINA'S VIEW OF IT.
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
WHATEVER
sour critics
and sarcastic
caricaturists
may say, Earl
BEACONSFIELD
is a darling'
There! If ED-
WIN sees this
he will be
angry, for he
does not be-
lieve in tho
popular idol.
I do, and so do
.__ all the nice
ll girls I know,
except a few,
a very few,
who are under
the influence
of grumpy
Radical lovers.
Lord B. said
of the Greeks,
that they "are
an interesting
people," and
that's exactly
what I feel about himself. He is so interesting that I am sure he
must be right*
I have beetl reading all his novels, and they are perfectly lovely,
though perhaps a little puzzling. EDWIN says they are an amazing
mixture of keen cleverness and tawdry rubbish; but at any rate
they are far more interesting than horrid political pamphlets, all
bad temper and big sentences. 1 don't say they are so nice as
Ouida's, or so easy as Mrs. HENHY WOOD s. but I 'm sure it's
awfully condescending of a Statesman and an Earl to be intelligible
at all. The romantic parts are simply delicious, and when I am
puzzled by the politics and the mysticism, I feel inclined to say with
TENNYSON, "I cannot understand; I love."
Indeed, it is this combination of mystery and niceness which is so
fascinating in an Earl. An affable Sphinx in a ball-room is bound
to be a success, and when the Asian Mystery curls his hair and talks
pretty, who could resist him? And, dear Mr. Punch, since he has
proved himself to be the greatest and moat delightful of men, why
cannot those aggravating Liberals let him alone? I am sure if the
QUEEN, and the Court, and the Clubs, and. oh! evert/body agreeable
or of any consequence, are quite satisfied, that grim-looking Mr.
GLADSTONE might be quiet.
Now there is a man I never cmtld like, though EDWIN considers
him the sublimest of heroes. He may be awfully high-principled,
and all that; but a man with that mouth and nose could never be
nice. If he would brush his hair, and not wear such enormous shirt-
collars, would talk pleasantly, and not object to everybody and
everything, well even then I don't believe he_ could ever be really
interesting, but he might be tolerable. As it is, 1 do not find that
anybody in Society has a word to say for him. But our Earl; oh!
he is the universal pet! EDWIN says we women are ruled by per-
sonal prejudices, and have no grasp of political principles. He also
says that the feminine spirit seems so to have permeated the politics
of the day, that partisanship and personalities have (for the moment
beaten principle out of the field. I don't quite know what he
means; but I do know that polities were never so interesting as
now to Your old Admirer,
ANGELINA.
P.S. If Mr. GLADSTONE had not been so very cantankerous, he
might have had that other Garter, no doubt. Why doesn't he.give
up Radicals, ,and Dissenters, and principles, _and post-cards, and
other unpleasant things, and go in for being nice and pepular, like
our Earl P

ON April 1st we reached Mossi, a soft, green spot, the residence of

Mother's dominions. The accompanying sketeh will give a more
than correct idea of what the palace was like at this time of year.
McSsruGGiNS, the Ventriloquist, who was in excellent voice,
interested the Gozlingi (the tabes reigned over by Queen UGANDA
and Prince UGITSE) to such an extent, that it was as much as I could
do to restrain the simple people from performing a series of surgical
operations on him with their knives, in order to find out where the
other voices came from. It was, however, a big success; and the
Koyal Arkadia (drawn up on shore, and the compartments so ar-
ranged, as to form a good orchestra, stalls, pit, private boxes, &c.,
holding about £150 when full) was crammed every night.
M'TIONTU also came out well, changing his dress behind a table,
and announcing himself as somebody else each time he reappeared.
If he had only kept sober, this entertainment would have been perfect,
but he would refresh himself whenever he disappeared under the table,

Then a Special Entertainment, by M'YIONYU, who (if
quite sober) was to give imitations, in character, of the
various celebrities of the House of Commons, including
the Member for Peterborough "with a Song," after
which a Ventriloquial Farce, interspersed with conjuring
tricks, entitled—

Or, Cox and Box in the Dentist's Cupboard.'

If this wasn't an attraction, nothing could be. I forgot to mention one
interlude—a pose plastique—representing
THE BENISON OF THE DUKE OF AKGYLL,
with Scotch airs on an improvised bag-pipe (made out of hollowed sugar-canes
and a leather foot-ball), played, at first, with much taste and discrimination
by McSMUGGiss; but unfortunately he became so excited by the blasts of his
national Highland air, that he shouted out something about "Auld Reekie"
and "his foot being on his native heath, and his name Macgregor" (which.it
wasn't, being McSiruoGiNs), and then took to dancing what he called a
McCancan, while blowing with all his might and main, until I contrived
to stick a knife into the foot-ball, and M» to speak took the wind out of
his sails, when he calmed down, and beoatne rational, but exhausted. The
entire show would have been a triumph if Mc8Muooi\s could only have been
kept from the whiskey-bottle, or the whiskey-bottle from him, or the whiskey
from the bottle, and it M'yiqNiry had only known anything at all about the
people he professed to bo imitating. Even the Gozlingi stood it for some time
calmly, but when M'YIONYU announced the twentieth Member of Parliament
(Irish Home-Ruler this time), and spoke ill precisely the same tone and made
file same speech (he has no sort of invention), and canie up from under the
table ill the same white wig and whiskers in which they had already soon

SALISBURY, and thirteen other notabilities, even these mild people couldn't
control their righteous indignation, and threw spears at him, which they had
brought in contrary to my regulations written up, "All spears, knives, &c., to
be left with the Saloon-Keeper (myself)," so that he was glad to get under
the table, and down through a trap, as quickly as possible. Luckily I had
ordered a man to be ready for him with this trap, or he wouldn't have got
off so easily. I appeased the infuriated people with the overture to the
Unmze Ilurse, and McSjiUGGlNS (who was almost sober) made an omelette in
the hat, which thcv devoured with avidity — hat and all. All passed off
happily. Cnr anil linx at the Dentists was good. We had to pretend that
M'YIONYU had fainted, and carried him home to his compartment. The
Arkadia is a most useful boat.
The next day we were preparing to go when the Queen came to me, and
said that she had understood 1 was a Christian. I answered cautiously that 1
tried my best, &c.
"If the White Colonel is a Christian, has he a wife?" asked Queen UGANDA,
looking down at her toe-rings bashfully. She was fifty, if a day, but a fine
woman, and, before our arrtval, very well off.
"The White Colonel is a Christian," I replied, "and never tells a lie when
he is at home. The White Colonel can only have one wife at a time."
"UGANDA will be the White Colonel's one wife," she said, modestly enough,
but with a great show of determination.
"UGANDA does the White Colonel proud," I returned, making my politest
bow, "but the \Vhite Colonel is afraid that the great and lovely Queen UGASDA
is trifling with his affections."
No she wasn't: not a bit of it. She had taken a fancy to me, and that idiot

M'YIONYU (whose business it is to know everyone's private affairs), had informed her that I
was a bachelor.
"Queen UGANDA loves the Great White Colonel, and will come with him to the end of
the world!" she exclaimed enthusiastically, at the same time throwing her dusky arms
round my neck, and shaking her nose-ring iu my face, to the infinite amusement of the
Printer's Devil from Fleet Street.
Now I said to myself, "Now or never! I must dissemble!"
Unfortunately the Prince, her son, was ambitious, and encouraged his mother in this
sudden idea of hers, which, as far as my personal appearance is concerned, was neither
strange" nor unusual. In fact—but we are on a delicate subject—and all I have to say is,
that I remembered th« mission to which I had devoted myself.
"Pardon me, Queen," I gaid, quietly, "but I mutt find STANLEY 1"
"I will find STANLEY, too!" she said,
simply.
"You shall!" I replied. '.'You shall
take the route to the South, while I take the
route to the North. Then at a certain point
we'11 meet again. Farewell!" And, tipping
the I wink to my followers, who had been
carefully putting together the compartments
of the Arkatiia, and to which Old Scratch,
the Dark Horse had been already trans-
ferred, and was drawing* it down to the sea,
I raised my handkerchief to my eyes, de-
clared my heart was breaking; that parting
was such sweet sorrow, that I would go
away, and come to-morrow, — and then
made for the boat like mad. In a second
a something whizzed by my ear!
A spear! It came from her son. the
Prince! It was the only weapon left on
the island. We had taken all the rest,
which we had collared either as payment
for the Show, or when left at the doors
with the cloaks and umbrellas, including
those thrown at M'YIONYU. As far as
spears could go—and they can go pretty far
—we were safe.
"UGANDA!" he exclaimed.
"UGUSE!" she cried.
And in another second they were weeping
in each other's arms.
The Gozlingi, with tears in their eyes,
met to debate the question of what should
be done with the Grout White Colonel,
who had spurned UGANDA'S oft'er.
Fortunately the Gozlingi never proceed
to deeds without a regular debate, or, as
they call it in their language, a kakkel.
In the midst of the formal preliminaries
we silently rushed Old Scratch (as good a
mare as ever drew bathing-machine) down
the shingle, with the Arkadia in tow, and
in another second, without a word or a
whisper, we had unharnessed and stabled
tin- faithful animal, my crew had taken
their places at the oars, and, with a hearty
cheer (not above our breaths), we dashed,
with a will, into the Lake.
We were all there; and with a grateful
and a beating heart 1 lighted a cigar, and
reclined on the cushions, while the Printer's
Boy turned on a'Selection from OFFENBACH;
and McSjiUGGrxs plas^fully threw his voice
overboard as far as the shore, startling the
Gozlingi, by making Queen UGANDA sud-
denly sing, "Ah, quej'aime lea Militaires,"
with admirable effect.
They all jumped to their feet; and as we
sailed away almost out of sight, McSiruc-
GINS braced up his ventriloqnial powers for
one final effort, and sending his voice right
in amongst them, he made the Queen say
to UGUSE, "Mr. STANLEY, I presume!
How we all laughed! And how nappy and
merry we were as we sailed away from the
simple, soft-headed people of Mossi!

ADVANCE, AUSTRALIA!

"THEY are coming up, Master," cried Toby in a fever of excite-
ment, "the entire Eleven."
"They are heartily welcome," replied Mr. Punch, with one of his
most graceful bows as the Ambassadors from the Antipodes, with
SPOFFORTH, BOYD, and the BANNERILLX Brothers at their head,
entered the sanctum.
"Be seated, my dear boys," exclaimed Mr. Punch, cordially.
The eleven sunburnt heroes looked at one another and smiled.
"We will sit down with pleasure," said the spokesman, "but
our favourite practice is to make a stand. You should see us at
Lord's."
"Ihave seen you both at Lords and Commons," returned Mr.
Punch, with enthusiasm. "I have seen you North, South, East,
and West; I have seen you all round. A splendid team! Australia
may well be proud of you, and England too, as branches of the
British willow, though grown at the Antipodes."
"H'm, I don't know," answered the spokesman; "we are pretty
well. But there are lots as good or better where we come from.
Still, I think that we have given you a fair taste of the Cornstalk."
"Before or behind the wickets, in the field,—everywhere,—us the
artfullest of bowlers or the best of bats.—you are simply magnifi-
cent!"
"Oh no. we are not," continued the spokesman, with modest
pride. "As you may have seen by reading the report of the speeches
at the dinner the other night, we don't consider ourselves by any
means the top-twigs of the Australian willow. But, as I say,
we are pretty well, and quite equal to teaching our grandmother—
if not your own Alma Matci—a thing or two."
"Ah! Cambridge was rather too much for you, but think what an
Eleven 'it was! You should have tackled them at the besinning
instead of the end of your campaign. But never mind that Don't
be put out," said Mr. Punch, good-naturedly.
We never are. except after a long innings," returned the spokes-
man. "Still, we don't think you quite understand us. Now, Sir, you
are certainly the best informed man in the Old Country.''
"Undoubtedly," replied Mr. Punch, who never flinches from the
truth.
"Well, Sir, what do you know about Australia? Now don't
look it out in the Encyclopedia Brilannica, but tell us off-hand."
"Australia is a magnificent country," returned Mr. Punch, with
enthusiasm. Then he added, with a little hesitation, "and it's
famous for all sorts of tilings."
"What things?"
"Oh, gold, and Australian beef, and kangaroos—and 'possums,
wombats, and ornithorhyncusses, black swans, black fellows, and
bush-rangers, and "then Mr. Punch came to a full stop.
"I thought so," said the spokesman, with a smile, "your ideas
about Australia are of the most Zoological-Gardenish character.
Are you aware, Sir, that our cities are full of magnificent buildings?
Are you aware, Sir, that trade and commerce are nowhere more pros-
perous than they are in our quarter of the globe? Are you aware,
Sir, that with us all the learned professions are represented by the

(Between Cardiff and Newport. Proceedings in Parlia-
mentary Committee Rooms this Session.)
THE biggest parliamentary railway fight that South
Wales has known since coal was discovered there, has
just been concluded. The object was the establishment
of a connecting link-line for the general benefit of the
several Welsh towns with unpronounceable names by
the ordinary Saxon, and for the special benefit of the
Newport Alexandra Docks. Of the importance of this
place, the outsider can judge from a speech of the
President of the Newport Chamber of Commerce, Mr.
J. C. PAHKIJTSON, J.P., who is reported to have said,
"AVe have at the Alexandra Docks the great advantage
of practically buiimlless space." Not bad that for
Docks.
"Open Docks,
Whoever knocks!"
Room for the shipping of several worlds and many
undi^'ovcn-il continents within this " boundless space!
The President wishes, he observesj in the preface to the
report, "the two ports to bo allies, not opponents, in
iiniiiftering to the trade of South Wales, and in pro-
moting its development," which arc "good worts," fair
and friendly to both. And, in re Ports, both Ports
ought to be much obliged to him for these re-ports^ as he
was clearly on the right tack,—which "Port it is, yer
honour I"
The advantages of the scheme wero so evident as to
have led one to suppose that there would be no opposi-
tion to " getting 11 j) steam" from anyone, least of all from
with it, and Boylc'd over, but ultimately Boyle'd down,
simmered, and subsided.
The result has been most satisfactory for the Alexandra
Docks; henceforth proved to be not the " needless Alex-
(inilrine" that "ends the Line." On the contrary, it
can now boast that its affairs have assumed the fairest
and healthiest complexion, so that the present state of
the case may be summarised in a couplet, which we pre-
sent, with our compliments, to the successful New-
porters—

"Stop! stop!" interrupted Mr. Punch, "you overwhelm me. Be-
lieve me, I am quite aware that Australia has taken gigantic strides
in the march of civilisation, from the date of her first European
settlement"
"You arc alluding to Botany Bay, Sir."
"Not at all, not at all," returned Mr. Punch, quickly.
"But we accept even the past of Botany Bay, Mr. Punch," said
the spokesman. "It is our boast that we currency-folk have been so
sound at the core that we have been able to absorb your convict re-
fuse without contamination from its criminal leaven. After all,
it is only what our Old-Country ancestors did about a thousand years
ago, when they took to absorbing Danish pirates first, and Norman
cut-throats afterwards."
"Then you know something of early English History?"
"I should rather think we did! Even before it had the Green
light thrown upon it. What we complain of in the Mother Country
is—that it's not nearly English enough to suit our tastes."
"Come, come," remonstrated Mr. Punch. "Surely England
takes the lead in everything."
"I like that!" replied the spokesman. "Why, who taught you
the blessings of the Ballot Act f Who taught you?"
"Well, you may, perhaps, be a little ahead of us in politics,"
interrupted Mr. Punch; but all social reforms begin in England."
"You dare say that, when you know that SPIKRS AND POND came
from Australia! Oh, Mr. Punch.' we blush for you!"
"Well, your hearts arc in the right places, at any rate."
"I should rather think they were! We love the Old Country.
We know how to handle the oar—as THICKETT has taught you—as
well ns the bat; and as for the rifle—shouUl the time come 'We
don't want to fight j but, by Jingo '''
"' If we do, dear boys, JOHN BULL would rather, by a long
chalk, rely on Australian Volunteer Riflemen than Indian Sepoys.
But a truce to all Jingoism; let us hope that is settled by the
Berlin Treaty. Believe me, my dear boys, when I assure you that
I love you so that I have had serious thoughts, on the invitation
of a branch of my family settled in Melbourne, to pay you a visit."
"You had better not; for if you came, we should certainly keep
you. And although your presence in Australia would be the climax
of our triumph, we don't want to ruin the Mother Country right
out."
With this pretty compliment the Australian Eleven after hearty
handshakes all round, withdrew.
"Our counterparts, though our Antipodes; and no blind side to
them, big bats as they are," said Mr. Punch. "No doubt about their
nationality. British Lions every one. Birds of a feather with the
old cock, and no mistake! May they and their great country, of a
still greater future, prosper!—and may 'Advance, Australia!' long
be the best description of her career, as well as the device of her
escutcheon 1"
The Police in the Purlieus.
THE frequency of suburban robberies occasions the inhabitants of
the suburbs to cry aloud " Where are the Police?" Echo answers
as usual; but a more distinct reply is returnable by the peripatetic
observer. The Police are mostly stationed about the public-houses
to look out for infringements of the Licensing Act. Wanted, in
the neighbourhood of this Metropolis, a sufficiency of Policemen to
attend not only to public, but also to private, houses.

THE LEGAL ROPE BROKEN.
HE Church oncemore
rides triumphant
over the Courts.
The Queen's Bench
—by two Judges to
one—and the two
including Chief-
Justice COCKBFRN
—lias cut the rope
with which Lord
PKNZANCE. as Chief
Judge of the Court
of Arches, had sus-
pended the recal-
citrant "priest" of
St. Alban's, Mr.
MACRON OCHLE, for
disobedience to the
monition of the
Privy Council.
So new Mother
Church laughs at
old Father Antic,
the Law; and LUSH
stands at judicial
daggers drawn
with COCKBURX
and M ^ LLOli; while
Chief Justice gives
a slap in the faee
to Lord Chancellor
and Privy Council.
It is a very pretty
kettle of fish —
Legal and Eccle-
siastical — and
Punch can only
point to it in blank
bewilderment.
When doctor?
differ, who shall
decide? A Chief
Justice, and a Lord Chancellor " shooting in each other's mouth," is
a startling spectacle. Themis may well stand aghast at the cross-
lights shown from the two highest peaks of her domain!
What CocKBUiiN thinks of CAJRNS'S law his judgment proclaims;
what CAIRNS thinks of COCKBURN'S, perhaps he will rina an oppor-
tunity of letting us know even before the end of the Session; what
MACKONOCHIE thinks of both we need not inquire. Punch can
hardly doubt that his uppermost feeling must be that let the Law
give him never so much rope, he can't hang himself; and so he is
free to snap his fingers at Common Law, and Statute Book, at Chiet
Justice, and Lord Chancellor, at Privy Council, Court of Arches,
and Queen's Bench, with larger impartiality of contempt, and priestlier
pride of defiance than ever.

BETSY PRIG AND THE MUSE OF HISTORY.
"The Muse of History, who has a good many reasons to favour the great
City of London, arranged the order of events so happily that the magnificent
majority which has endorsed the policy of Her Majesty's Ministers was ob-
tained and hailed through the length and breadth of the land just in time to
render the civic banquet a commemoration as well as a compliment."—Daily
Telegraph.
So I writ in my moment of joy, when my buzzum with wictory
burned,
And I thought, like my BEXTY'S Philippic, 'twas pinted and pootily
turned.
Then I nodded and napped o'er my nip, and a sort of confugion
come o'er me,
And Clio 'erself—that's the Muse!—stood in propry persony
afore me.
She were much more sewere in 'er looks than I 'd always been led
to suppose,
A"trifle more tight in the lips, and a leetle more red in the nose,
She didn't look werry elated, nor eager to bust into werse,
And no more like the party I'd pictered than Mars to a old monthly
nurse.
"'Ow d 'ye do. Mum?" I sez, "which I 'm proud to receive sech a
werry old friend!
Take a cheer! If so be you 're dispoged for a drop "(here my
'air stood on hend,
For she gave me, oh, Lor! scch a look! 'twas as sharp and as
straight as an arrer,
Wich it seemed to go in at my buzzum, and frizzle me slap to the
marrer.)
"BETST PRIO," she observes, orful 'orty, "my name you've been
takin' in wain"
(I can't ketch her style, not exactly)," I beg you'll not do it again.
You 're a fulsome and foolish old woman, which that I can freely
excuse,
But you stick to your own gushing cackle, and don't interfere with
the Muse."
I felt myself bilin' with wrath, and a-shiver with fear all at once.
"Well,'' I sez, " this 'ere 'a 'ardly perlitc, Mum; you 're settin' me
down as a dunce!
Which the triumph of BEN and them big City feeds was ewents, I
did think,
As was worthy yoxir finest gold pen and your werry best wiolent
ink."
"BETST PRIO," she replies, "you presoom! I prefer to choose
themes for myself.
What you fancy the chicest of chanev to me may seem commonest
delf.
If you think I shall follow your lead or consult your great City's
desire,
You are awfully out in your views of what Clio's high functions
require."
I sez, "You '11 eicuge me, I 'ope, but my BENOT now! ain't he an
'cro?
His fame is at glory-pint now, while his rival's is right down to zero.
(All along o' not taking my tip! Wot a obstnit himidge it is !)
Now you don't mean to say you '11 begrudge a big page in your
record to DJZ P"
"Not at all, BETSY PRIG," she replies, "but my werdict may often
re werse
The noisy awards of to-day, and applaud where the mob may
asperse.
The chords your BEN touched have responded, those struck by his
rival seem mute;
But which would have made noblest music is open at least to
dispute."
"But," I sez, "ain't it lovely to see 'ow BRITANNIA'S improved 'er
position,
Since BKNJT ' picked up the dropt threads of Old England's imperial
tradition'?
She 'as wrote with the pint of 'er sword on the bleak Balkan
ranges—oh, Lor!"
Here I stopped, for she give me a glance as confuged me and filled
me with hor.
"Fine phrases and flatulent figures," sez she, "are the charlatan's
tools;
But the wise are not duped by sham watchwords which rally the
legions of fools.
Imperial? Many-sensed word that makes music in many long ears!
The Muse is not fired by its sound. Better wait till its meaning
appears!"
She said it that scornful and cold, I was riled, and felt game for a
row.
But somethink as quite shet me hup seemed to shine from 'er ragiant
brow.
Then she wanished like smoke, and I woke—or leastways I suppoge
'tti'as a snooze.
But if that there cool party was Clio, I do not think much of the
Muse!
Drummed Out.
MR. TEAMAN, who misrepresents Dundee, as Ginx's Baby repre-
sents that Liberal borough, has been struck off the Liberal List by
the Opposition Whip. He has gone so often into the wrong lobby,
that it is felt he had better stav there. In fact, his "Yea" hae
been " Nay," and his "Nay" "Yea " on so many critical divisions,
that many think his name ought to be changed from YE.AMAX to
NAYMAN, as well as his party label from Liberal to Conservative.

HOW TO SPEND AN UNHAPPY DAY IN LONDON.
7 A.M.—Awake to the rumble of the vegetable carts and the cries of the
milkman, the hearth-stone vendor, and the early coster-monger.
8 A.M.—Pay your first visit to Covent Garden Market. Not* the vegetable
slush, the dead lock of vehicles, the bad language of their drivers, and the
general air of dirt and confusion. Dodge the carts, cabs, and waggons. If you
do not get run over, put your handkerchief to your nose, your lingers to your
ears, and bless the Duke of BEDFORD.
9 A.M.—Take a train from Portland Road to Moorgate Street in a carriage
containing double its complement of passengers. Inhale the sulphurous atmos-
phere, and compose a letter of indignant remonstrance for to-morrow's
Times.
10 A.M.—Spend an hour in crossing from the Bank to the Mansion House.
Fill up your spare time in avoiding the importunities of shoe-blacks, flower-girls,
and perambulating petty tradesmen.
11 A.M.—Return to the West End by the Thames Embankment, and study
the practical jokes of the London rough as exhibited between Somerset House
and Charing Cross.
12 NOON.—Walk in St. James's Park, 'carefully dodging the stones playfully
thrown at each other by thousands of children from the Westminster slums.
Should your hat suffer, be thankful that it is not your head.
1 P.M.—Pay your second visit to Covent Garden Market, which you will find
dirtier, noisier, and^more unsavoury than ever. Spend your time as before, and
again bless the Duke of BEDFORD.
2 P.M.—Take a cab north or south, and enjoy the peristaltic motion of the
lower viscera induced by the wheels of your conveyance catching in the grooves
of the tramways.
3*p.M.—Go to Westminster Hall and enter *ne of the Courts, first feeing:
the Usher to carry you out in the probable event of asphyxia.
4 P.M.—Pay your third visit to Covent Garden Market. Observe that the
dirt of the place is now increased by another dav's vegetable refuse. Fight
for your life as before, and repeat your blessing of His Grace of BEDFORD.

[AUGUST 17, 1878.
5 P.M.—Take an excursion train on the London, Brighton, and
South Coast Railway, and look out for accidents.
6 P.M.—Dine on lukewarm viands in a fearfully overheated
restaurant, to the mnsic of an overpowering orchestra.
7 P.M.—Push your way into the overcrowded pit of a popular
theatre, and sit out the fun of a " playing-in " farce.
8 P.M.—Pay your fourth visit to Covent Garden Market, which
you will always rind a safe draw for discomfort. Exercise your
Christian charity in blessing the Duke of BEDFOBD for the fourth
time in twelve hours.
9 P.M.—Spend an hour at Charing Cross dodging the omnibuses,
cabs, and fire-engines. If you have time, examine the character of
the passengers lounging abuut the platform of the Railway Station,
and its approaches.
10 P.M.—One more visit to Covent Garden Market. Take stock of
the dirt of the day, and then home, miserable, to bed.

Water-Log on board the Arkadia.—To-day, after a week of very dry
weather, M'riONru managed to come up with a magnificent specimen
of the Bodega, just within sight of port. I should much have liked
to have brought over one of these curious creatures to England. The
Bodega, which, when on shore, has often been mistaken in the dark
for a mermaid, scented our approach, and I was raising my glass (a
very strong one, a kind of binocular of double strength, multiplying
the ordinary power of vision by two), when it came up out of the Lake,
and made a tremendous charge, for which none of us were quite
prepared. However, the Bodega didn't get the best of an old
sportsman like myself, who soon gave the creature the benefit of
a couple of barrels, and, in less than it takes me to tell, the
amphibilious brute was staggering on the plain. [Note.—I have
subsequently discovered that a. Cockle Shell tired right in among
a number of these amphibilious creatures, is the best remedy
for getting rid of them.] Presently he dropped, then rose again,
but a few more drops finished him. The Bodega, being something
between a whale and a hippopotamus, affords both meat and drink,
but chietiy the latter to the fortunate traveller. Unluckily for us,
the Bodega, haying died hard, its flesh was absolutely uneatable.
On examining his hide, we came to the conclusion that he had been
engaged in a terrific combat before our arrival, from which he had
come off the victor, as we found the distinct marks of two horns of
a Dylemma. This warned us of the probable proximity of a herd of
these dangerous animals. The Bodega is of a tawny yellow colour,
with a leathery hide, and a sort of casque over its head, with which,
when on shore, it butts at you fiercely. It is also furnished with
three sets of scales, major, minor, and crow-matic—the latter being
a protection against these birds (hence the name), which attack it when
sleeping. It was impossible to secure a live specimen, as my men were
all too tired and footsore to move on; and so, after giving direc-
tions as to their all keeping a careful watch for a few hours while I
slept (for in these regions it does not do for everyone to sleep at the
same time), I retired to my Arkadian Hut, and, as the Printer's Boy
was working the punkah with one hand and turning the musical-
box with the other, I sank into a profound and delicious slumber.

meaning a sort of light, midday meal, consisting of a little cockaleekie,
broiled lake char (which are caught here in abundance by the native
charwomen, who go down to the banks in their carts, made for the
purpose, and called char-ar-bongs), some buffalo beef, with mixed
pickles, chutnee, and an excellent tomato salad, (for which I have
a patent receipt, worth millions to a public caterer, and which I
can part with for a moderate sum, giving private lessons into the
bargain, if the purchaser will ask me to dinner,) some prawns stewed,
iced venison cutlets—venison far superior to anything in England,
and as plentiful as chops in the Southdown country—a tart, made of
native berries, and some fresh undereurrants from a neighbouring
stream (for I have a sweet tooth—in fact, several sweet teeth, I 'm
glad to say—and can relish where others would starve), which,
mixed with a desert-spoonful of a rich cream (obtained from limes,
and far superior to anything a cow can give), makes an entremet
fit for a Lucullus, and altogether represents a menu that would
gladden the heart of many a noble Amphitrite, or Amphi-try-on—I
forget which — it may be the "try-on"—but I mean a classic
Gentleman, who used to get up first-rate Entertainment Scenes,—in
the Social Circle, perhaps, as there was something of the Amphi
about him,—nt all events, to sum up, I had finished my stojjero,
and, just to finish with, had taken mv forty winks (picked out
with a pin, an admirable digestive), when in the distance, about
10° N. by 50 S., I saw—a shadow!!!

Detcription of Sketch.—I think I see STANLEY about 500 miles distant,
longitude 50°, nnd uny amount of latitude allowed. From a drawing taken on
the Knot. (N.li.—Fine opportunity ofl'ered for advertising in my book of

The trees represent the marvellous distance, but the two black spots disap-
pearing over the equatorial line are represented as they appealed to me
through my binoculars, and are, no doubt, ine extreme points of Mr. STANLEY'S
coat-tails as he was running away down-hill.
On second thoughts, he was not tunning away: but his vanishing points of
coat-tails prove to me indisputably the globular shape of the earth. Had the
earth been flat, I eo'ild never, with my binoculars, have loet sight of the
object of my indefatigable search,

B, STANLEY walking against the wind,

D, STANLEY'S coat-tail points blown out by the wind. His head, being
well forward, is out of the line of sight, which pastes, horizontally, through his
shoulders, but in its first direction is stopped by the two points of coat-tails.
Had these not cut the line of sight, it is evident that I should have seen
STANLEY'S shoulders; and, had he stood erect, probably I might have
recognised him by the back of his head.
In any ease, I consider my theory of the earth's shape satisfactorily proved,
and should be glad to receive a gold medal from tne Eoyal Geographical
Society, which might combine with the Humane and other Societies to give
me five hundred a year for life, as a valuable consideration for Discoveries

"Mr. STANLEY, I presume!" was the work of a moment. But, alas! he had gone from my
gaze — gone from iny GAZE— like a Cook's Tourist (jeu tie mot, made in diary, even under
the most trying circumstances) • and once more I am all alone in the Great Desert.
More from Diary.—When I write "More from Diary," it occurs to me that this reverses
the order of things: it ought to be Diary from MOKE—at least vie.always have an Alma-
nack from MORE, and the Diary generally goes with it. Toujnurs gai! Allans done! The
idea occurs to me, perhaps STANLEY is coming back. "He will return—I know him well"
(Song); but, perhaps, I don't know him well enough, and he won't return.
Leaving this spot about ten P.M., we came m the cool of the evening to Jokla Island.
This I have reehristeued Joe Miller's Men. On all the rocks I have inscribed my name with
a pen-knife. This I do wherever I go; and sometimes I scratch it on a pane of glass with
a diamond ring. In lieu of any other legal and prior claim this signature confers proprietor-
ship on the cutter. And can't I cut with a diamond! On such occasions it is of very little
moment who cuts after me. "What shall he do who comes after the King?" Catch him,
if he ean. They want to make me king of the Jokla lalea, with a salary of two thousand

SOMETHING LIKE A WELCOME!
MB. PUNCH, SIB, 10th August, 1878.
I APPEAL to you. Have not the claims of the ancient historical town with which I
have the honour to be municipally connected been inexcusably ignored? Do not the two
junior Knights of the Order of the Garter owe their present proud position as much to the
action of the Provinces as to the influence of the Metropolis?
Sir, we expected Lords BEACONSFLELD and SALISBURY to visit us. We had made magni-
ficent preparations, strictly governed by precedent. Those preparations are now useless.
We have lavished our money upon costly signs of welcome, and the men who were to be
feted have never turned up! But a time will come; and Lords BEACONSFIELD and
SALISBURY may yet have reason to rue the hour when they ignored the claims of Little
Peddlington! Sir, I will give you the programme we had arranged.
First, we had decorated our town in the most magnificent manner. Flags waved from our
shop-windows by the dozen, with the most appropriate devices. Our principal Grocer

.. _ ourpence!" in this way we symbolised
event of the day and its heroes with commercial and mercantile prosperity, and while doing
honour to our expected guests, did not omit the tradesman's duty—of advertising himself.
But our happiest thought was the decora-
tion of the town-pumps. Last year they
fell into decay, and the order was given
that they should be removed. We deter-
mined to restore both on this occasion to
their original grandeur. We covered them
with canvas, painted in imitation of stone,
and tin-foiled their handles. But 'this
was not all. Taking our town architect
into council, we had prepared and set up
two models, in tin-foil and papier-mache,
of our municipal crest, an owl.
Need I say that we had a Guard of Honour
of Volunteers? Our citizen soldiers sug-
gested by their presence the celebrated
Motto of the great Jingo Party, "Defiance,
not Defence.
But we kept our greatest coup for the
bouquet — the speech of our Vestry Clerk.
To this intelligent officer we entrusted the
duty of welcoming the two Plenipoten-
tiaries on their appearance to receive the
freedom of our town. I have much pleasure
in sending you a draft of the speech which
our Vestry Clerk had composed, and got off
by heart, for this interesting occasion.
"My Lord BEACONSFIELD. I have much
pleasure in welcoming you to Little Ped-
dlington. Take it all in all, your Lordship
has not done badly. Born without any ad-
vantageous circumstances, and haying to
battle against the unreasoning prejudices
of rank and caste, you have risen from the
lowest stratum of society to equality with
the nobles of the land. Having commenced
life as a clerk in an Attorney's office, you
would doubtless (had you stuck to that
branch of the legal profession) have risen
to the Bench. You have also written some
highly successful novels, and have thus
made the trade of literature nearly re-
spectable. I will now give you my ideas
about things in general, and foreign poli-
tics, in particular. I think, &c.. &c.—
(Here came the opinions)—I think the pro-
clamation of Sir GASKET WOLSELEY to the
Cypriote very neat. And now. my Lord,
we propose giving you a good dinner at
the Mayor's house. Be honest and true
to yourself and others, and you may rest
assured that you will long retain your
present very respectable position.
"My Lord SALISBURY.— We have hon-
oured Lord BEACONSFIELD; and, in common
fairness, we will honour you—in a minor
degree, of course, as your Lordship played
only second fiddle at the recent Congress.
My Lord, some of your ancestors were
Aldermen; and, doubtless, had you fol-
lowed in their footsteps, you might have
become (who knows?) a Mayor. But
though this honour has not been brought
within your reach, you have done very
fairly; and your present position reflects
the highest credit upon you. I can assure
you, my Lord, that we nave no reason to
blush for you; and you know, as the old
proverb says, that when two men ride upon
a horse, one must ride behind.
"And now to both of you, my Lords, I
offer the right hand of municipal fellow-
ship. Believe me, my Lords, we are not
proud in Little Peddlington."
There, Mr. Punch.' Now I put it to'you
candidly—Do you not think that in our
decorations, and, still more, in our Vestry
Clerk's speech, Little Peddlington would
have run London hard in municipal wel-
comes, had our ancient and worshipful Cor-
poration had the chance of entertaining
the Hero of the Day and his subordinate,
the Foreign Secretary.
If you do not think so, Sir, why then I
am nut Yours, respectfully,
BOANEKOES BUMBLE, Alderman.
The Town Hall, Little Peddlington.

W. E.G. A sophistical rhetorician, inebriated with the exuberance
of his own verbosity, and gifted with an egotistical imagination,
that can at all times command an interminable and inconsistent
series of arguments to malign his opponents, and glorify himself.
Ready for Use.
J B . A political nonconformist, puzzled by the responsi-
bilities of his own incongruous position, and distracted by the devious
demands of a paradoxical party, either feverish in factious opposition,
or inebriated by frantic anticipation of unattainable office.
R L . A pedantic professor, imbued with the acrimony
of his own C3rnical utterances, impotently aimed at reputations
beyond his reach, but judiciously reticent of all reminiscences of
his own short-lived, though long-lamented official career.
SIR G I) . A titled plebeian, swollen into imaginary
importance by the gaseous inflation of a self-dishonoured name,
and armed with a pachydermatous insensibility to the righteous
contempt of the sages of the Senate, though not insensible to the
titillation of hustings popularity, and suburban pot-house applause.
EARL G . A mercurial dawdler, idly consistent in de-
fence of a desperate'cause, and consequential with a wrangling wit,
which, when aimed at the shield of the Statesman, recoils, to find
its target in the motley of the fool whose bow launched the bolt.
LOHD R M . A shallow babbler, ever struggling between
the remorse of the renegade, and the conceit of the sciolist.
MB. P . A laughing philosopher, fed fat by the fertility of
his own uneaualled fancy, and gifted with a splendid imagination,
which is the key to an inexhaustible armoury of wit, humour, and
satire, whose shafts delight, instead of distressing, the fortunate
objects at whom they are aimed, and who, while overwhelming his
opponents, immortalises himself.

THIS is the time of year to be in Town. "We are en fainllle. People give just as good

diner-out just now confers a special favour on a host.
Koto one can wear anything in London, without inviting objectionable remarks. I 've a
hat which only appears at this season of the year in London—my August hat. It has done
so for years, and is uncommonly becoming,—I mean, "becoming uncommonly" old. I've
also a coat, so worn out, that the only time I can wear it out is iu August. 1 think of getting
up a subscription to revive it. If so, to insure success, I need only go round with the hat.
Mr. HOLLINGSHEAD'S electric light, bright as daylight, outside the Gaiety Theatre, is an

batti-batti-ing—have started their Promenade Concerts at Covent Garden. W ith the eminent
M.D. (this is Doctor of Music—not Medicine, his compositions being the very reverse of
nauseous) for Conductor, the " bus" ought to go on well, the Conductor singing out, "Full
inside! All right!" (N.B.—To outsiders; bus" in professional parlance is short for
"business." No further explanation of the joke will be given.)
"Conductor, Mr. ARTHUR SULLIVAN, assisted by Mr. ALFRED CELLIEB." says the adver-
tisement. How does he assist him? Does he give "him a pick-a-back up the stairs? see him
carefully into his chair '( fan him when he's hot? liquor him when he's dry 'i put eau de
Cologne on his pocket-handkerchief, and when the first part of the concert is over, does he
with hia friendly arm aid the exhausted Conductor-en- Chef's tottering steps down-stairs
again, and then turn on a lavender spray
ml he is quite recovered? I must go and
judge for myself. But my night shall be a
Classical Night. In this overpoweringlv hot
weather give me a Classical Night, and the
lightest possible drapery of a Grecian pat-
tern. Expect me, Dr. SULLIVAN, on one of
your Classical Nights. I shall come, with a
boy carrying the latest edition of the Clas-
sics ; as, if in appropriate costume, I sha'n't
have any pockets. Yes, Dr. SCLLIVAN, you
will "meet me once again," and I shall
catch your eye when you're "looking

At the meeting of the Alhambra Com-
pany (Limited)—"limited," you'11 observe,
for the line must be drawn somewhere, and
probably the members of the corps de ballet
are not included in the Alhambra Company
when "Limited"—it was triumphantly an-
nounced by the Chairman that this "was
the first time in the history of the Alham-
bra when there was £1,600 profit on the
operations of the musical and theatrical en-
tertainments." Hitherto "the only profit
had been OH the liquor!" "Drink, pretty
creature, drink! seems, up to now, to
have been the feature of the Alhambra's
success. But how was this £1,600 profit
obtained? Well, it appears from the jubi-
lant Chairman's speech, that, among various
economical items, they had saved £320 for
Authors and Royalties. Hang the Authors!
but who were the Royalties? Surely,
H. R. H. or the Royal Dukes can't be sup-
posed to charge so much " for attendance?
If so, the Alhambra must have saved con-
siderably by the continued absence of these
Royalties. As to Authors and Composers,
they can't have got much out of the Al-
hambra lately, as there is nothing to pay
for La Fille de Madame Angot. and this
piece appears to be their staple commo-
dity. Why don't they start something
new? Or, if they want to be still more
economical, why don't the Shareholders,
who pay their Directors handsomely enough
"their remuneration amounting to
£2,200" (as Mr. BOLTON showed, and com-
plained)—why, I say, do not the Share-
holders insist upon the Directors writing
an Opera among themselves,—the Vice-
Chairman could do something with The
Vicar of Wakefield,—anA., if necessary, as
a further economy, singing it themselves,
finishing up with a magnificent ballet
danced by all the Directors, who would then
be really doing something for their money.
The ballet should be called, out of compli-
ment to one of their most energetic Direc-
tors. Leda. "An' bedad, Sorr," says an
Irish friend, "instead of a swan, ye might
substitoot an agle."
Mr. NEVILLE is appearing as Pierre
Lorance in Proof at the Adelplii; and he
ought always to have played it. There is
something in the bills about town (only 'tis
too hot to read details) about the piece being
"re-mounted." Is there anv arrangement
made for running it with real horsesr

IT may be found difficult to adjust the

we do not, as a nation, practically care. Or should we not, as a
nation, practically rise en masse to see that the remediable things,
to whicn good public servants have so vainly called attention, shall
bo remedied? Have we no voice for these voiceless millions? What
is the saddest sight to bo seen in the East—nay, probably in the
world? The saddest sight to be seen is the peasant in our own
Eastern Empire. But we do not look at this sight—no, not even
those few who travel in India."
These are not light words lightly spoken in debate, not an ex-
tract from the discussion raised in the Lords on Monday, by Lord

formed and most highly-placed natives of Bengal, on the subject of recent increase of taxation
and expenditure on military charges and public works—but the beginning of the saddest note
ever uttered by NIGHTINGALE, an article by FLORENCE of blessed memory on the People of India,
in the Nineteenth Century for August. What weightier comment on her complaint could
there well be than this, that the Indian Budget is postponed to the very faggest of the fag-
end of the Session, and fixed for the day of the Navul Review, when it will be listened to by
a handful of weary Members, whom Punch could count on the fingers of two hands—if
not of one.
We commend those who read Lord NORTHBROOK'S Monday speech, and Lord CRANBROOK'S
reply—brook calling to brook, but with little refreshment for the poor parched Indian ryot
between them—to turn to FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE'S sad song in the Nineteenth Century,
if they wish to see what is the normal state of the ryot of Madras and the Bombay Deccan
between money-lender and drought, and the pitiless grind of the Government tax-gatherer
and the Local Law Court—how he hangs habitually on the edge of famine, to fall helplessly
into its gulf, under the least downward
impetus : unable to save, or to dp more than
secure the barest subsistence in the best
years, and with no margin of strength to
hold him up against the burden of the
worst, till the end is written in the ap-
palling fact of a famine-mortality in Madras
of between live and six millions. If JOHN
BULL has to answer for this, and there seems
too much ground for fear that he, or at least
the Government, has to answer for it in a
great degree, it ill becomes him to be taking
upon himself the reform of Turkish Go-
vernment in Asia Minor. Who shall say
that with all its sins of omission and com-
mission, it may not cause less human misery
than our finely adjusted, and inexorably
working Indian machinery, which drives
life down to starvation-point, and never re-
laxes its pressure till the poor starved ryot
drops dead out of its elaborate wheel-work.
(Commons.)—Mr. GORST called attention
to the case of a native of Tanna hung
aboard the Ecagle, on very doubtful proof
of complicity in the killing of a white man.
He objects to the system by which naval
officers are turned into judges of Assize, and
Her Majesty's ships into perambulating
gallows. This brought down the ATTOR-
NEY-GENERAL'S bludgeon, clumsily rather
than heavily, over Mr. GOEST'S knuckles.
After Sir JOHN'S usual style he did his best
to convert defence into attack, and to
maintain positions which have been aban-
doned by his official superiors. If Mr.
SMITH had got up at first, instead of at last,
to say that the Admiralty had sent out a
despatch calculated to put a stop to the
practice complained of by Mr. GORST, the
Government would have saved its credit,
and the ATTORNEY-GENERAL would have
escaped another bad mark.
Lord G. HAMILTON, in moving the Educa-
tion Estimates, gave a highly satisfactory
Report of Education progress since Mr.
FORSTER'S Act was passed in 1870, as
measured by all its landmarks, money
spent, numbers of pupils, schools, and
teachers. If only one could gauge the
effects of the education as well as the
figures!
Tuesday (Lords}.—All the steam powers
in Tramway Orders Confirmation Bills were
knocked on the head by Lord HENNIKEH,
Lord NORTON chief mourner over them.
My Lords, who drive their own carriages,
don't love trams—steam-trams, least of all.
The Earl of CAMPEHDOWN asked for re-
turns of the Reserve Men who had been
turned out of civil employments, through
turning-out in obedience to Royal summons.
Lord BURY hoped there were none. So does
Punch. If the return of Reservists to the
ranks is to mean starvation of wives and
children first, and loss of employment after-
wards, Lord CARDWELL'S hopes of the
System would seem cottleur de rose indeed.
(Commons.)—After questions, the House
resolved itself into Committee of Ways and
Means.
Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE presented his
little Bill—the first instalment of the cost
of peace with honour. The Government
has spent some £400,000 over the Six
Millions. There is a deficiency of £4,306,000
to be met, of which rather more than half
will have to be raised, the other half being
already provided for. But Sir STAFFORD
does not mean to come upon JOHN BULL for
the money. The little Bill can stand over.
The Two Millions will be provided by
Exchequer Bills. Something will turn up
in the course of the next two years to wipe
'em out without our feeling the operation.
Everything is for the best in the arrange-

merits of this best of all possible Governments. So, in spite of a
groan from Mr. GLADSTONE, and a growl, accompanied with a good
show of damaging precedents, from Mr. GUILDERS, the House jumped
to Sir STAFFORD'S proposal to renew the little Bill instead of paying
it. Of course Mr. RYLANDS doesn't like it. But what does he like—
a nasty cantankerous person P And Mr. E. JENKINS wanted further
explanations; and Sir G. CAMPBELL, and Sir G. BALFOUB were dis-
agreeable as usual.
Major NOLAN called attention to the insufficiency of the allowance
to the wives and children of Reserve Men. He pointed out that while
sixpence a day to the wife, and twopence a day to each child, is the
sum now allowed wives and families of men serving in India, they
have rations and quarters besides.
While Colonel STANLEY was speaking in reply, the deep voice of
the Major was heard chorusaing each sentence with a "hear, hear"
so sonorous that nobody could hear anything else. Called to
"Order" by the House, and bade to desist by the SPEAKER, the
Major refused point-blank, alleging his right to call " ' hear, hear,'
after every comma, if I choose, and every semi-colon." Pressed to
give way, he hardened his heart, and re-asserted his right in still
stronger terms. Ajax defying the Brand of Jove, is the only
parallel that occurs to us of the Major braving the Brand of the
House—the awful and omnipotent SPEAKER, who in vain called on
him for an apology.
In the end, the last reserve of the SPEAKER'S power was called into
play—the reluctant bolt was hurled—the Major was "framed."
This awful exercise of authority is so rare that the memory of it is
confined to a few of the oldest inhabitants of the House.
This "solemn duty," as Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTB very properly
called it, having been discharged, it devolved on him, as Leader of
the House, to move that the Honourable and gallant Member, for
his disorderly interruption and disrespectful conduct to the Chair,
be directed to withdraw.
In vain the chivalrous O'CONNOR POWER, and the self-sacrificing
Sir P. O'BRIEN strove to induce the mighty O'GoRMAK to change the
Major key for the Minor; in plain English, to apologise. He pre-
ferred to withdraw, and take tne as yet unimagined consequences.
Dr. O'LEARY pleaded that the Major was labouring under strong
excitement "by considerations of professional wrong," as Sir P.
O'HRIEN was careful to explain, "lest the excitement should be
attributed to any other cause." In spite of an effort to get the words
"disrespectful and "disorderly" struck out of the Motion, it was
carried, with another, that the matter be considered to-morrow,
when the Major should be summoned to attend. Then the House
calmed down sufficiently to return to business.
Mr. HATTER hoped the Government did not mean to adopt the
recommendation of the Joint Committee of the War Office and Civil
Service Commissioners to give marks for athletics in examinations for
Commissions. Major ARBUTHNOT thought a combination of phy-
sical and intellectual examinations would work well. Mr. CAMPBELL
BANNERMAN thought otherwise.
Colonel STANLEY would give the matter his best consideration,
which hitherto he had not been able to do. But he thought the onus
probandi lay on the Committee. There had been no complaint of want
of stamina, activity, or aptitude for athletics on the part of the
competition officers.
(Surely, exclusion for physical incapacity would secure all the
athletics necessary, without giving thews and sinews undue pull
over brains.)
Wednesday.—Plank-beds in Irish prisons again on the tapis. Mr.
MITCHELL HENRY wished to know whether the Irish Prison Board-
bed was going by the Board? Mr. LOWTHER hold* on to the
Board, but would be willing to allow an indentation in it in the case
of female prisoners. But bed-clothes and a night-dress are per-
mitted.
(The sooner the Government gives up this stupid piece of severity
the better.)
Then followed a touching scene. The Major apologised, and was
restored to the bosom of his afflicted family.
What a subject for the Artist who in the Commons House of the
Future is charged to paint the most memorable incidents that have
transpired in the Commons House of the Past!
Mr. DILLWYN asked for a Select Committee to winnow the Esti-
mates. The House said No, by 64 to 46.
Mr. HAYTER moved to reduce the Supplementary Army Estimates
by £25,000, the charge for huts at Cyprus, by way of drawing the
Government of any information in its possession about that highly
interesting island. The Marquis of HARTINQTON followed suit. He
wanted to know what was the meaning of sending the Indian force
to Cyprus? The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER says the garrison
will 'be 2,000. Why send 10,000? How about the health of the force
—their accommodation ?" He would not be surprised to hear that
neither the Admiralty nor the War Office could give any detailed in-
formation." This Captain STANLEY proceeded to prove.'by admitting
as much. General chorus of " Que diable aUez-vous fairs dans cettc
isle de Cythere f" Nobody seems to know. Perhaps, as the occu-
pation goes on, the Government may find out. Occupation by the
troops will breed occupation for them.
For the present, all is in the dark, beyond the fact that there the
troops are, and very hot they find it, and that a good many of them
are down with fever.
Thursday (Lords}.—Several Bills advanced a stage towards the
happy dispatch of Royal Assent.
[Common*.)—Captain PIM, that "simple sailor," on Naval Re-
serves. Messrs. MACDONALD, BUM, and the HOME SECRETARY on
the very unsatisfactory subject of Colliery Explosions—for which
somehow nobody ever seems to get punished—the poor ignorant reck-
less miners, who are to blame for so many of these catastrophes,
because they are generally the first sufferers; and the careless pro-
prietors or managers, who are infinitely less excusable, because of
the difficulty of getting the deaths laid at the right door.
Mr. FAWCKTI wanted more light on the principles that would
guide the Government in carrying out the Anglo-Turkish Conven-
tion, and the guarantees for the needed reforms. So did Mr. E.
JKNKINS.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER replied that
"What the Government hoped was to bring about an agreement with the
Porte by which certain spccinV refonns woultl be introduced into the judicial
revenue, und police systems, which, it was believed, would give a prospect of
improvement to the country."
Brave hopes! But how about guarantees?
Friday (Lords}.—Cattle Diseases Bill back, as amended. The
Duke of RICHMOND could hardly have known his child, yet he wel-
comed it with every ti?n of affection, notwithstanding that the
"stain of the Commons is over it all."
(Commons.}—Bishoprics Bill pushed merrily through Committee—-
undamaged by llie assault of the Nolo-tpiscoparis, COURTNEY and
CAMPBELL, and COWEN and JENKINS.
Final Vote in Supply taken, and—
"Last Ftnge of all,

Appropriation Bill brought in. The Ministerial Fish Dinner

REGINA V. REGINA.
{Everybody intervening; or, the next Cote on the Lift.)
THIS was a case of some interest arising out of an application on
the part of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council to the final
Court of Appeal, to restrain the Queen's Bench Division of the Hi^h
Court from issuing prohibitions against their monitions. The Parties
appeared in person.
The Lord President commenced his opening statement by saving he
knew a prejudice existed against a plaintiff who insisted on conducting
his own case; but as he wished particularly to test his own judicial
status, about which so many highly unpleasant things had been
alreadv said, he was determined at least to find out " who he was."
The Lord Ultimate Justice interposing, said he hoped there would
not be any attempt at elucidation of any indivividual Judge's status
introduced into the argument. The question before the Court was,
"Who on earth are the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ?"—
That at least was the only issue to which he could direct his attention.
The Lord President.—I think, my Lord, it would be just as well
if you were to direct your attention to the limits of your own juris-
diction. We shall certainly raise that question at a later stage.
The Lord Ultimate Justice.—That is a very candid announcement,
my Lord President; and though I and my learned brother constitute, I
believe, the highest Court of Appeal in "the kingdom, I have no hesi-
tation in saying that I am disposed to join issue with him on every
possible aspect of this amusing and contusing case. What, I shoula
like to know, is the value of a judgment passed by snch a tribunal as
what used to be called the Court of Queen's Bench?
The Lord Chief Justice submitted that that was not the question
before the Court. The Court of Queen's Bench had rather a
more respectable foundation, he hoped, than the Court of Arches.
(Laughter.)
The Lord Ultimate Justice.—Or, as no doubt the defendants in
this cause would add, the House of Lords. (Renewed laughter.)
The Lord President then proceeded with his case. He said that,
after all, the ques ion submitted to the Court was a very simple one.
It might be broadly stated as follows: Ought a set of Judges, who are
handsomely paid_ in order that by their precept and example they
may exalt the dignity of Justice, to descend to what he must term
VOL. LXXV.
"procedure" by practical joking?" It was too bad. He and his
learned colleagues regarded the late action of two of the Justices
of the Queen's Bench Divisiou as nothing short, at least, of this.
He could only say, on behalf of the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, that if the Court to which they now appealed could give
them no remedy, and they were to be held up as a laughing-stock
without anv sort of redress, they should know how to take their
revenge. The Exchequer Division had had far too quiet a time of
it lately; and he would like to know, for one, what was the present
market value of a decision of the Ix>rd Chief Baron.
The Lord Chief Justice objected. If this sort of sifting were to go
on, they should soon get a definite view of their respective jurisdic-
tions, and he appealed to the Court to say whether this would be
likely to add to the solemn mystery of justice, or to exalt the public
respect for that complicated procedure which was, if not its brightest,
at least its most costly jewel.
The Lord Supreme Baron here interrupted. He said: I think
it right, upon hearing that statement, to mention that I have, during
the progress of this case, been indulging in some considerable scruples
as to my own position in this Court. I shall, therefore, now refuse
to grant any application until I am assured as to the nature of my
jurisdiction. The rule must be refused.
The Lord Ultimate Justice.—Nonsense. I don't concur for an
instant. I am only too happy to add to the confusion of this cause.
You may take a rule—or two, if you like.
The Lord President. — Yes, my Lord, if we can find them.
(Great laughter.)
The proceedings then terminated.
THE ARMS OF CYPRUS.
"It it interesting to note that the arm« of Cyprut are borne on on* of
the (Molds on Queen ELIZABETH'S tomb in Westminster Abbey, viz.,
Barry of ten arg. and az., over all a lion rampant g\i., crowned or."—
Athenccum.
WHERE good Queen BESS'S honoured bones
Sleep in the Abbey's gloom,
The Arms of Cyprus grace the stones
Of her emblazoned tomb.
In argent fair and azure bright
Barry of ten behold;
O'er all, a lion rampant, dight
In gules, and crowned with gold.
Fair emblem of the happy fate
That now on Cyprus shines,
And in our rich Protectoratej
Re-opes her long-closed mines.
And what if British Lion's gules
Bt toned to a dun-brown r
Besides the crown upon his head,
His purse holds many a crown.
Sharp Cypriotes, who Jews can. 6q,u«M#,
Armenians confound,
That Lion of his crowns to ease,
And eke half-crowns, are bound.
With cunning thus in coat confest,
Punch Heralds' pardon begs,
If he with deference suggest
The Isle's Arms s/wuta be Legs.
A Missing Link.
JOHN EVANS, D.C.L., &c., &c., in his Address, as President of
the Geological Section of the British Association at Dublin, refers to
one member of the group of quaternary Mammalia, as " far more
abundant in Ireland, than in England or Europe—the Megaceros
—which has rightly received the appellation ot Sibernicus." It
is strange that Mr. EVANS should have omitted to notice another
distinguished member of the same group, which ought to be far
more abundant in Ireland than in any other part of the world, the
peculiar family of the Dot Taurus «liirh has also won world-wide
tame under the epithet Hibernicut.
If the Irish Elk be so common in a fossil state, surely fossil speci-
mens of the Irish Bull ought to be forthcoming, if sufficiently
looked for.

(Lords.)—Lord TRFEO on the Police Force. 2. quelque chose

have given Lord TBTJKO an intelligent interest in the Force that so
lamentably fails him. He now comes forward as the friendly critic
of the Bobby, and as the "Parent, Guide, Philosopher and Friend"
of the Commission which is about to sit on him. He suggests inter
aUa that Model Lodgings should be provided for the Police, when
Metropolitan street improvements are a-making. At present our
view of the Bobby at home is chiefly in the character of warming-pan
of the "House to Let," or locum tenens for the family out of town.
It would be much if the public could see the Force as the model
Lodgers of Model Lodging-Houses, A-l's in their interiors, and never
on the beat at home, as but too many males of the married masses
are apt to be.
The Duke of RICHMOND said the Commissioners should have the

to Merv, in dangerous proximity to our North-West Indian fron-
tier?" asks Sir C. DILKE. "Has a Russian Resident been received
at Cabul?" asks Mr. C. B. DENISON. "Not knowing, cannot say,"
answers Mr. HOUKKK, for the Foreign Office. "But if they are up
to any little game on the Oxus, or in Cabul, the Foreign Office has
its Eastern eye on them, and will, no doubt, in due tune know all
about it." For the moment F. 0. knows nothing about anything, or
knowing, cannot say. Further questioned, through said Honourable
Mr. BOUHKT:, F. 0. declares that it has not heard that the Porte has
refused, or means to refuse. Greece any rectification of frontier, for
all the recommendations of Congress. Sir CHABLES means to go on
asking questions, till he arrives at more satisfactory answers.
Mr. GOTJHLEY, thus encouraged, has also taken to ask questions,
about the departure of the British Fleet from Turkish waters,

As yet Chickens and Bears confront each other.
Mr. FORSTEE procured the House the painful pleasure of hearing
the history of a little Bill, birth-strangled between Lords and Com-
mons. The tragic tale is beyond the grasp of prose—Facit indignatto

Chancellor of the Exchequer.
"Twice the House hos talked its fill
Over MELLOH'S little Bill.
Twice the Lords that bill amended;
Twice the Commons-House, offended

In their face the Amendments threw:
Intermediate Irish Education Commissioners named. A happy
family—three Catholics, three Episcopalians, and one Presbyterian.

Session, and that an Irish Act!—amid an unprecedented chorus of
discordant voices for once harmonious. Well may the poet say,
"The sweetest music is from discord bred.''
The Bill is to secure payment by results. If its result be to show
us for once Roman Catholics and English Protestants working
together in harmony for the promotion of better Education—in the
schools of both—who shall say that any payment can be too high
for such a result, though it took two millions instead of one of the

Tuesday.—Lords and Commons at sea—dancing attendance, to the music of waves
more rough than was agreeable, on BRITANNIA'S Naval Review of Her Coast-Guard
brood of chickens, the "Particular Service" Squadron, under Admiral KEY, at
Spithead. It was very spiteful of BRITANNIA not to rule the waves straighter for the
occasion. She and NEPTUNE and rude BOREAS spoilt the show between them.
While the Commons were steaming back sick and tired from Portsmouth, a House
had been kept, by Black Rod's summons of a handful of the Commons to the House of
Lords to hear the Royal Assent given to a batch of belated Bills. And then, to a
bea-garlv account of emptv benches, Mr. STANHOPE rose to disburden him of his
Indian Budget—the concluding farce of a played-out House and an expiring Session.
Mr. FAWCETT criticised Mr. STANHOPE'S figures, and protested, m the name of
economy, ap-ainst reckless expenditure and cooked accounts, with a courage and spirit
worthy of a better House and a more attentive audience.
"Who cares for Budget or critic? "All's well" (says Mr. STANHOPE),—" That
ends well," add Mr. FAWCETT and Mr. Punch.
The thin House, savs Sir STAFFORD, is no proof of languid interest in the entertain-
ment of the "Indian ^Balance-Sheet," so long as the few who come understand what
they are listening to. India is not to be governed in England. The thinner the
House when the Indian Budget is up—or down—the more proof that England, if she
understands nothing else about India, understands what is best for her great depen-
dency — to be left, unhampered by House of Commons critics, to the V iceroy and
Indian Secretary of State, and their respective Councils.
As to economies in Army and Public "Works, and provision for Famines, past
and future, let the House of Commons leave such matters to those whom tbev concern.
The best thing the House can do for India is to stand aloof, and trust her to the
tender mercies of an enlightened Empress and a paternal Government. "So it is
willed, where Will and Power are one." And who is FAWCETT, that he should fidget
himself, or England?
Wednesday (Lords).—A Sign of the Time. My
Lords sat at three o'clock, and, after a few minutes'
work, " adjourned during pleasure." Met again at
six, and adjourned again (during pleasure, we pre-
sume), at five minutes past. Yet in this brief time
they knocked off a Second and a Third Reading
and three Committees. Only let the Commons go
and do likewise two or three nights a week, and
they might "adjourn during pleasure" for the
rest of the Session.
(Commons.)—How" about sickness among our
soldiers at Cyprus? It is hard to reconcile
Colonel SlAXLEY'sreports, and Daily News' Corre-
spondent's. Here is the latter's hospital return:—
"The 42nd Reziment has 170 on the rick list; the
101st has ISO. Six artillery officer* are down. Of 136
Bailors and marines sent to Nicosia 84 are fever-atricken.
One officer and 19 marines tent to Baffo were there for
three weeks, and are now all in hospital. A detachment
of sappers sent into the interior was found helpless iu a
larai-house, every man beini delirious with fever. In
all about 25 percent, of the white troops are fever-stricken.
About two-thirds of the medical force are also dowri.
The fever is not deadly, but those attacked cannot quite
recover while they remain in the island."
How the SECRETARY for WAR can say, in tho
face of these figures, that he cannot say there is
any cause for anxiety, it is hard to understand
tor those outside "the Office," who do not know
the difficulty of disturbing the normal serenity of
the official mind. The poor soldier in Cyprus may
sing—" In me tota rutt I'enus"—at fever-heat,
too; and all the calm confidence of Colonel STANLEY,
and the couleur-dc-rose reports of Sir GABNET will
neither cool his burning brow, nor moisten his
parched lips", still leas give comfort to his anxious
friends at home. As Punch said last week," Que
(liable allaient-ils faire dans cette tie de Cythere f"
F. 0. knows nothing yet about the dispatching
of a Russian Resident to Cabul. It seems likely
enough that the reports of Russian movements,
both Diplomatic and Military, in Central Asia,
refers to the pre-Peace Congress period. None the
less our Jingo journals are keen in working them
up into war-material.
Mr. SAMUELSON called attention to a painful sub-
ject, which demands more notice both from the
Government and the Public, than it has yet re-
ceived, the murder and mutilation of Mr. OGLE, the
Times Correspondent, in Thessaly. Our Govern-
ment have directed and held an inquiry, but as
they could not, or, at least, would not guarantee
impunity to the witnesses, it seems very doubtful
if their inquirers have got, or could have got,
at the truth. They have promised to direct fresh
inquiry, with powers, it is to be hoped, to ensure
due protection to witnesses. The friends of Mr.
OGLE have good reason to be grateful to Mr.
SAMTJELSON for bringing; the Government to this
point. So have all British subjects who feel it
of moment that foreign, and, above all, barbarous
Governments, should be taught that the life of
a British subject is a sacred thing. When that
British subject happens to be a man discharging
dangerous duty in a heroic spirit, his life should
be doubly sacred. As it is, there has been a nasty
disposition visible to impute blame to Mr. OOLE for
his very courage and humanity, and to add some-
thing very uglily like, "Sarve him right!" to
the vague official verdict of "Found Killed;
but how, when, or by whom, no evidence is forth-
coming."
Bishoprics Bill read a Third Time by 63 to 20,—
Ginx's Sabj/ protesting to the last.
Thursday (Lords).—Last day'swork. Sing "0
he joyful!" Standing Orders dispensed with for
once—pace even Lord REDESDALE. Appropria-
tion Bill and Expiring Laws Continuance Bill
rattled merrily through all their stages in a sitting.
(Commons.)—Notices of Motion—for next Ses-
sion. Thank the House's stars, and Punch's, loose
points are being "flemished down," and ends of
questions coiled away. Punch, happy in the pros-
pect of his holiday, bursts into song, like his own
little bird:—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"The Government duu't mean to tind, nor jet to niakr, occasions
To re-establith with the I'OPE diplomatic—or other— relations;
The Turkish troops still hold Batoum, which F. 0. much amazes,
But England has no intention of taking in the Latet.
Sir AUSTIN LA YARD will do his best—Herculean operation !—
To induce the Grund Vizier to take Crete into consideration.
There has been a good deal of fever among the Cyprus garrison,
13ul, on the whole, it has been drawn mild, and is now " en procts de gue'rison."
Sir G. HOWTEK shot a last shot at the Territorial Waters Jursidic-
tion Bill, but missed his mark; and the Bill was read a Third Time.
Henceforth, when a foreigner violates our law within three miles of
our shores he will be punishable for it, as he ought to be.
Lord C. BERESFORD gave a full account of the operations for the
raising of the Eurydice, and the difficulties which had retarded
them. The poor ship is out of the hole at last, and everybody's wish
must be that her unfortunate captain and the Dockyard Authorities
who have had to do with the sinking of her, first, and the raising of
her afterwards, should be in the same position as the ship.
So let bell be rung,
And De Mortuis sung!
The persistent COURTNEY had a last pitch into the dealings of the
South African Government with the Transvaal. Punch oan only sing,
"Annexation is vexation,
Division i* as bad—
SIIEPSTONE (Sir T.) he bothers roe,
Aud the Boors they drive me mad."
Never was a harder BEECH-nut for the industrions Secretary for
the Colonies to crack. "Of two evils choose the least" is a good
rule. The difficulty in this case is to say, between annexation
and independence, which evil is the least, they are both suoh
whoppers?
Friday.—Parliament Prorogued by Royal Commission. Commons
whipped into Lords' House by Black Rod to hear (iueen's Message:—
My LORDS A»D COMMONS,
fn oft seems the day
When, wishing peace, we met to face affray.
To calm the twitter* bred of War's alarms,"
We gladly threw ourselves in 1 mini's arms;
But as they 're happily Sot wanted, home
We 've packed them, post-haste, o'er the ttoi §** fvtttn.
lluy the Monsoon and heat no cholera bring,
And then "All's well that ends well!" we may sing.
The 1'owers for Congress at Berlin have met;
High hands have there to protocols been set,
Whence, let us hope, the flower of peace may bloom—
For which, just, now, see Bosnia arid Batoum.
Greek h;>s met Turk, but not for tug of War—
The tug of 1'eace Hellas finds harder far.
We with the Turk have signed our own Convention,
Which, like a certain place we never mention,
Is paved, throughout, with the best good intention.
Bv it we're bound to guard the Asian border,
Within which fie binds himself to keep orcter.
These obligations both alike accept—
We must ask Time to show how they 've been kept.
Meanwhile, to mark the end of Europe's quarrels,
A Cyprus wreath we 've twined for lack of laurels.
"Pox cum honors" at Berlin we've won;
And *' Tax cum oners*' hue now begun.
GBNTLBMEN OP THE COMMONS,
Thanks all round;
We 've asked for money: money you have found.
MY LOKDS AND GBNTLBMEX,
Too well one knows
Queen's Speech "propose," but Parliament " dispose."
Of Engli.-h Bills passed into Acts the amount
Upon one band's tour fingers you can count.
There's one for Factory Laws consolidating:
One that provides for Koad-repair and Kating:
One with what's left of Cattle 1'lagues' big Bill:
And one to make four Bishop?, if you will—
But by quite voluntary contribution—
The thiug to save the Church from dissolution!
Of the three Acts tor Ireland—favoured nation'—
One—that for Intermediate Education—
Passed, wondrous to relate, with no opposing:
Not so the one lor Sunday-shebeen closing.
That such Acts should pass is a thousand pitiea—
True, it leaves out the hve chief Irish cities.
The third Act makes the Public Health iu care;
For that there 's room in Ireland, and to spare.
For Scotland,—happy land of oatmeal-cakes,
Where no Home-Ruler's clique disturbance makes,—
From tolls on bridge and road henceforth made free,
To good account she '11 turn each saved bawbee.
Her Education Acts, too, have been bettered,
Her schools and hospitals from clog» unfettered.
New Co home-pleasures, and home-dune* fall—
So, good-bye! Happy holiday* to all!

ANOTHER NAVAL REVIEW.
IERE was one Naval Review
on the twelfth; there is
another before .P«»eAatthis
moment, beinga Review by
HENRY F. WATT, Master
Mariner, "of the State of the
Navy, 1878," printed and
published at Liverpool. This
little book of seventy-one
pages, with not an idle or
superfluous word in it, deals
exclusively with our un-
armoured ships of 1000 tons
and upwards. The . writer
gives very clearly and calmly
stated reasons for his con-
clusion, that this portion of
the Navy is not what it
ought to be, and that a great
deal of the money spent upon
it is wasted. In proof of this,
he goes through the list of
our Wooden ships built since
1807, comparing the strength
and speed, power, cost of
building, and repairs, and
actual performances of each,
with those of first-class
chant vessels of the same tonnage, This comparison lands the
liralty and its Constructors awfully on the wrong side of the
.nee-sheet.
nother section of the book, devoted 10 the important question of
_ >al Education, gives reason for the writer's conclusion that the
Aamiralty is as much out in its building up of Queerfs officers
as of Queen's ships.
Now, it is no dorrbt ertsy to find fault. But it is not easy togive
such itat fetid forcible reasons for your fault-finding as H. F. WATT
seetts to Punch to h«tve given in his Naval Review. And not to Punch
only. A Rear-Admiral of longer and more various sea-service than
any officer of his rank and standing, after reading Mr. WATT'S
pamphlet, said in Punch's hearing, He is right, as far as I can
make out, in every point, except in his over-insistanee on lengthiness
as a quality in sea-going ships. That, I think, he pushes too far.
For the rest, I go along with him, from stem to stern."
This rather startling, but decidedly well-written and well-reasoned
brochure Punch would earnestly recommend to his nautical readers
in general and to Mr. T. BKASSEY in particular. Something ought
to come of it.
RITUALISTIC RUMOURS.
THE triumph achieved by Mr. MACKOJTOCHIE over Lord PENZANCE
and the Public Worship Act, has of course tended very much to
encourage Ritualist Clergymen to set the law at defiance. It is said
that they have the following steps in contemplation:—
To erect in every Church a Roodloft enriched with Images.
To adopt the use of Holy Wrater, and to provide every Church
with a receptacle for that fluid.
To set up a Confessional Box in all Churches and Chapels.
Habitually to wear all the vestments in use amongst the Romish
Clergy—especially tiaras exactly resembling the Triple Hat of the
Roman Pontiff, by way of symbol that not a man of them cares a
Henedicite for his Bishop, but that every one esteems himself his
own Pope.
Surplice and Surplus.
(C. LEWIS and NEWDBQATE loqimntur.)
THE Irish Education Bill
Can you wonder we run down—
Irish Church Surplus when it turns
Into a'Jesuit's gown?
Between Advocates ftttd Architects.
(High and Low.')
STEELY it would be possible to conduct the controversy between
high-pitch and low-pitch roof at St. A'lban's without getting into
such a high-pitch of temper1 and low-pitch of courtesy; in short,
without suob a flinging of pitch by the advocates of either style of
ro»f at thoso of the other.

(Mr. HAWFINCH tearbles.)
I REMEMBERS the Gleaners when I wuz a buoy,
In a suiock-frock and trousers o" striped corduroy;
AVhat the rippers had left, then the farmers could spare;
And the poor and the needy went in for their share.
I thinks I can zee 'um, when harvest wuz done,
Afield mongst the stubble in evenun's slant sun,
The women and children in eountree array.
Or to whoam wi' their bundles o' grist on their way.
The moor mouths by the projuice o' gleanun wuz fed,
The less rates wuz required to supply 'um wi' bread.
0. BUMBLE, friend BUITBLE, bear that in thy mind;
The moor gleanuns, the fewer the paupers to grind.
Then the words wrote by Mozus wuz took for plaain truth,
Likewise all as we rades on 'bout BHTWOOAZ and RUTH,
And to strip the iields bare when the harvest was o'er,
Wuz condemned as no better nor plunderun' the poor.
But the times for the Farmer wuz differ'nt from now
In the days o' my youth, when I foller'd the plough.
Competition 'a then hadn't none for'n to fear,
And to voorce 'un to rake up and scrape up aitch ear.
'Twaz by hand that they farmerly cut all the sheaves,
Too much earn, arter gath'run, machinery leaves.
All as went to the gleaners, now, therefore, by means
Of the hoss-rake, their own selves now the husbunmen gleans.
'Twixt the fields the old hedgerows wi' flowers once so gay
High farmun has purty niifh swep all away.
To impoveridge his ground a chap can't let 'um stand;
As a needs for to till every strip of his land.
We that lived in the old world now lives in a new,
The commandment o' which is to scramble and screw.
We sims sent into it only Life's battle to fight,
For the most that we can, to the best of our might.
'Twuz a fur differ'nt tale as we used to be told;
But this here is the new world, and that wuz the old.
And the gleaners be gone, and their gospel as well;
And Ruths as goes gleanun now finds it a sell.
NEWS FROM CYPRUS.
THE Daily News Correspondent in Cyprus states that in two days
nearly ten per cent, of a certain detachment of troops were struck
down with lever. If that rate of sickness continues, it is to be hoped
that the retreat of the Ten Thousand may not be long delayed.
Mr. FORBES goes on to say, "General WATSON is effecting a sweeping
reformation in the sanitary state of Larnaca." But surely some-
thing deeper than a mere sweeping reform is necessary. There must
at least be a thorough draining reform before the risk of fever can
be lessened. Unfortunately, this Reform Bill will have to be settled
by British taxpayers. But if Great Britain is to be allowed the
distinguished honour of draining Cyprus, she must not grumble at
being called on to pay the piper. And, thanks to the Anglo-Turkish
Convention, it is not at all unlikely that Turkey may eventually
return the compliment by draining England. Such are some of the
advantages of a spirited foreign policy.
A Tale and its Boot.
THE Times is authorised to give an " unqualified contradiction"
to the report that Mr. ALEXANDER BERESFOHD HOPE is about to be
raised to the Peerage. Punch is happy to add that it was not HOPE
who "told the flattering tale."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
HAPPY CYPRUS!

THE following; letter*
have been received
during the last ten
days at 85, Fleet-Street.
To save postage-stamps
Mr. Punch publishes them
with his minutes for an-
•i^r.^t-i2 swer:—
7, Prospect Place, Beth-
West.
spei
nal Green,
MY DEAR PUNCH,
You are a friend to
all good fellows, and I
am sure you will be a
friend to me. I feel that
I am a man after your
own heart. I am always
ready for a lark or a liquor
up. Just now I am nipped
—down on my back, den't
you know—and I want
you to set me up again.
Ever since I spent what
my father left me, and
determined not to be a
burden on my mother and
sisters, I have been trying
all sorts of things.
A friend bought me a
commission in the Army,
but I found soldiering an
awful bore. Besides it was expensive, and BO I had to sell out
to settle with the more pressing of my duns. Then one of my
uncles put me into a Government Office. But I got sick of that
in a week. Fancy being tied to one room and one desk from
ten to four! 80 I threw it up, and somebody did something for me
in the City. Need I say that I hate the City? You will not be
surprised to hear that I soon came West again, and with the assist-
ance of a friend had a go-in at the wine trade. The wine trade is a
mistake from a commercial point of view. How can you make any-
thing when all your old pals keep dropping in, all day Ivmg, for
nips? To make a long story short, I have had my passage pud to
Australia, and have come back by the next return boat but two.
I have been offered a share in a scientific farm, and once helped the
sub-editor of a weekly paper for nearly a fortnight. In fact I have
had all sorts of openings, but somehow or other all the openings
have closed again before I could make my way through them.
And now, my dear 1'unrh, cornea tlie pith oi my letter. I know
yon have any amount of interest. I want you to get me an easy
and lucrative post at Cyprus. You can if you like, go be a good
chap and do, and ever oblige, Yours cordially,
(Signed) A.'RoiLlHesTosE.
Mr. P.'» Minute.—Bad shillings are not in demand in Cyprus.
The export trade in ne'er-do-weels may be safely left in the hands
of the native and neighbouring Greeks. Bequest refused.
246, Kensal Green Villa*, North, North Kensington.
SlK,
DON'T you think that the Antiquities of Cyprus should be
looked up, somehow or other? I am rather hazy about the character
of these Antiquities, and I don't quite see what is to be done with
them when found, beyond making a note of. But I shall be happy
to serve on a Commission or a Committee, or anything of that sort.
I don't quite know what the duties of the Commissioners would be,
except— I am tolerably clear on this point—to receive their salaries;
but still I feel something ouu'ht to be done. At least, don't you
think so? Cyprus must be thoroughly gone into—prehistorically
as well as historically, classically, medisevally, and modernly, don t
you agree with me? If so, do kindly say a word for
Yours sincerely,
(Siyned) PET EH VASTTE.
Mr. I'.'s Minute.—Judging from some recent appointments, Mr.
V AC. i: K seems to be the very man for the post he suggests. If Cyprus
has no opening for his services, his name might be added to the list
of the City Charities Commissioners; or, better still, he might be put
on one of the new Eastern Boundaries' Commissions.
Phase address, Post Office, Basinghall Street.
MB. PUWCH, Sot,
OUGHT we not work together? Cyprus, that freshest, if not
finest gem of the British diadem, is quite ready for operations of a
philanthropic character. We really must do something for our new
dependency. So to sjieak, the Cypriotes are waiting to be done.
Let us be up and doing at once. Enclosed you will find a few
prospectuses of a philanthropic description. I would call your
attention to the Cyprus Children's Bank, intended for the savings
and "little alls" ot the Cypriote widows and orphans; the Cyprus
Glove Company, for furnishing Cypriotes moving in society with
white and lavender-coloured kids; the Cyprus Wedding Cake,
Mimv Pie, and Hot Cross Bun Association, for extending to our
swarthy fellow-subjects the blessings of English Civilisation; and
the Cyprus Anti-Prodigal and Good Samaritan Discount Corporation,
for lending wealthy Cypriotes (on really good security) small sums
of money, at the rate of, say. two hundred and twenty-five per cent.
The capital for working these excellent institutions will have to
be raised in England. Will you join me in these and kindred
plans? We would halve the proceeds. As to the work, you might
represent the Companies in London, while I proceed to survey our
field of enterprise in Cyprus. Is it a bargain?
(Signed) Yours, respectfully,
JEHEITIAH DIDDLEB.
Mr. P.}». Minute.— Proposal declined. Perhaps if Mr. DIDDLER
refers to recent advertisements, he will find that some of his bene-
volent schemes have been anticipated by equally disinterested
philanthropists.
THE COVENT GARDEN OBSTRUCTIONISTS.
THE Daily Telegraph lately gave us this information :—
"CoviST GARDEN MARKET.—In accordance with an order issued by the
Duke of BEDFORD a fortuight ago, all Sunday trading ia henceforth to bo
prohibited at this market."
If the Duke of BEDFORD can issue such an order—which sounds
uncommonly hard for those whose work only permits them the con-
venience of an early Sunday morning for their marketing—let him
go a step farther, not out of Covent Garden, but in it, and round it,
and round about it. Covent Garden is an unsavoury obstruction,
the roadway round it is almost impassable, and the " Odour Covent
Garden " is worse than the " Odour Cologne" itself in its own native
place. Let his Grace of Bedford determine to deal with this Dis-grace
of London, and until we can have an entirely new Market (the great
Hebrew Race will go in for plenty of entries for such a New Market),
let him get a new broom and sweep it clean, as also the streets round
about, which are the Market's tributaries. Such a state of Stinko-
malee as Covent Garden now represents ought be an impossibility in
our Nineteenth Century London.
Order in the East.
IT has been truly said that "one of the difficulties in Eastern
Ronmelia will be to prevent the rival zealots from attacking one
another." The measures about to be taken for that purpose seem
the reverse of promising. The European Commission ia to provide
a local militia and a police force of Christians and Mussulmans in
proportion to the number of the sects in the several districts. Let
us hope that militia will not fire on militia, nor policemen run in
policemen.

FBOM the
summit of the
hill, we had no \v
before us, for
thousands of
milesand miles,
a magnificent
champagne
country, which,
in accordance
with my own
feeling at the
moment, I at
once christened
Trayseck.
The King of
this country,
who bears the
name of. RHF.O
Bouir, came out
to meet us with
his brother,
JEKBI BoCu—
no relations, as I subsequently ascer-
tained, to the gentleman who used to
have the Cremorne Gardens — and ac-
companied by the two Prime Ministers
PdsiiLEKl and GRATXO, and all the MAG-
NTIIIS of the place, as well as by an "•'•>MNJ v "4 > «vV:.\\_
elderly lady, the Queen Mother, whom
both the Royal Brothers respectfully
addressed as Mum."
They seemed a very uppish set, with a strong family resemblance among them; in fact,
as the Printer's boy remarked, in his own graphic way, "there seemed to be only one sort of
'phiz' among the lot."
At first I thought we had met with a most intelligent specimen of the savage; but,
though they made a great noise at first, they were very soon drunk, and then 1 discovered
them to be the emptiest set I had ever come across.
We came away with a few dozen of the wine of the country, and as much more as we
could conveniently carry.
Before leaving, I made a sketch of these extraordinary people.
, It was necessary to press forward, as, up to this time, I nad not yet found STANLEY.
At this point we came upon the extraordinary Tapcock Falls, above the lower basin.
Here the natives, a very cleanly race, came out to meet us, and offer us refreshments, of
which we stood much in need. After helping ourselves freely from the exquisitely scented
contents of the so/je-dishes (the specialite among this people, who are amply provided with the
material in question), and having regaled ourselves with a few barthbunz (a sort of rich cake),
we witnessed a race between three of the native Tow'losses, who ran a course without any
jockeys. The first Toic'loss was much cheered as he passed the Grand Wash-stand, where
we were seated, but the race being a flat one-^-more than usually flat—did not interest me
much. Besides, I wanted to get on. When I intimated this, the simple people replied that
I couldn't "get on," except at a hundred to one. This I courteously, but hrmlv, declined,
adding, with unmistakable irony, as I politely bowed myself out, "Mr. WALKEB, I
presume!"
They were a small, but sharp, tribe; and, after counting heads, I found that they just
exceeded my own party by one. This decided me. They were one too many for us; and so
I determined on leaving as quickly as possible.
Their costumes were indescribable. One line will, sportingly, sum up this curious tribe—
t. e., A small race, with nothing on.

first, and our , —___„ 7 0 ,.
After a few days' rowing in the Arkadia—with myself seated under the awning, cheering
my men, and keeping them up to their work, which I must say was none of the lightest,
considering that the thermometer stood at 120° in the shade (i. e., under the awning)—we
passed one of the pleasantest-looking islands I have ever seen, offering a vast haven of rest to
the weary and sun-burnt traveller.
"Now who will o'er the downs so free?" I sang out cheerily to my men, who really
wanted encouragement—" I mean, who's for shore?"
They all held up their hands, except TIDLI WINKI, the native Guide, who implored us
not to attempt a landing on this spot.
"Why not?" I asked, casting a longing glance towards the cool inlets of water, sheltered
by umbrageous overhanging trees.

"Because!" [he replied, as though he
were answering a riddle—"because, Mas-
ter, that place has a very bad reputation!
It is full of shady coves."
It'i was with great difficulty that I
managed to save WINKI from the ven-
geance of the crew, who, having all heard
the joke years before, in their early child-
hood, would have torn him to pieces for
cruelly reminding them of home and com-
fort, by his ill-timed levity. McSsiuoGlNS,
the ventriloquist and Entertainer, was
specially indignant, as he had used the joke
so often in his entertainments, that he had
come to look upon it, quite affectionately,
as his own.
TIDLI WrxKi protested that he had meant
what he had said, but promised, at an inti-
mation from me, not to do so again.
"Yes!" I murmured, half-uneonsciously
to myself, " I should like to do the island!"
'' You must get up very early in the morn-
ing. Master," answered the snubbed TIDLI,
"if that is your intention!"
"I have "been there and still would not
po," he presently added, with a sigh, "for
they know, only too well, under which thim-
ble is concealed the little pea ; they are per-
fectly up to the right card to choose out of
the three; and they are old hands at the
Confidence Trick."
The fact was that some American Mission-
aries had been there, and judging from our
thermometer, had found the place too hot.
They left early.
"Who is their Chief?" I inquired; for
his account of the place awakened my in-
terest.
M'YTONTTT smiled.
"Who is it?" I repeated, sternly, for,
when I am in my imperative mood, I am not
to be trifled with.
'' You do not know, Master?" asked TIBLI,
in utter astonishment.
"I do not," I replied, sternly, from the
steerage.
"I will tell you," said M'TIONTU, with
an air of importance. "It is DUMCBAMBO

At the mention of this redoubtable name,
the Printer's Boy gave a whack on the drum,
TIDLI clashed the cymbals, and McSjiT/o-
GINS imitated a chord on the violoncello. All
the others threw themselves into various
poses indicating intense terror. It was a
tableau calculated to strike with awe natures
less impressionable than my own.
When they had recovered, I asked,
"Who will go with me?"
A dogged silence was the only answer.
On repeating my question, and obtaining
no reply, I said aloud, as if to myself, in
my bitingly sarcastic Ollendorfian style.
"Good. The Sailors will not go with the
Captain. The Captain will go without
(sans) the Sailors. The good Captain will
have all the gold, and the silver, and the
diamonds, and the jewels, and the beauti-
ful treasures in the mines of this island.
But the Explorer's companions (i.e. the
companions of the Explorer) will have
nothing. Let the had Sailors row to the
shore. The good Captain commands the
bad Sailors to row to the shore."
They obeyed my order with alacrity.
"Master," exclaimed TIDLI. suddenly,
"I will go with you. We are here to-day
and gone to-morrow; and what was to be,
and what isn't to be, won't be," he added,
with true Mahommedan fatalism. "If we
lose you, Master, we lose everything," said
the grateful fellow, as spokesman for the
rest. He acted as Spokesman, on account
of his now being the man at the wheel.
After half an hour's hard pulling, I
leapt ashore, and, my men being exhausted,

THE NEXT NAVAL REVIEW.
(By Telegraph.)
PORTSMOUTH, 8 A.M.
THE morning is tine, the sea calm, and the leaves are per-
fectly still. Not a breath of wind, fortunately. The Authorities,
however, are rather anxious. Some of the sailors of the Omniputent
have not learned to walk upon the tight rope, and it is feared that
they may cause that powertul Ironclad to lose its finely adjusted
balance and capsise in consequence.
10A.M.
The Authorities are in high spirits. The whole of the Ironclad
Fleet has moved nearly a dozen yards without serious mishap. The
Thunderbolt, however, very narrowly escaped a terrible accident.
Some careless Seaman allowed a heavy shot to roll on one side,
causing the vessel to heel over in a most alarming and dangerous
manner. A light-weight Midshipman, with the assistance of a small
balloon, was, however, able to repair the mischief before the ship
turned turtle.
12 NOON.
Another mishap! Some silly Artillery Volunteers have just fired
a gun. The concussion has caused a distinct breath of wind. The
Ironclads are rocking and rolling in the most violent and perilous
style. They have had to be anchored; and now the Authorities are
talking about using Russian air-bags as a further precaution.
2 P.M.
A great diappointment! The Naval Review has had to b«
postponed! Sufficient wind has sprung up to blow out some of the
nags. Besides, it is beginning to rain.

there is to be a return match. The following is our list of the two

Mr. J. B. BUCKSTONE 'also a long innings—stumped).
Mr. JOHN HARE ("caught"-Theatre).
M. H. IRVING (long leg).
Mr. S. BANCROFT (who will score some splendid runs).
Mr. J. L. TOOLK (in two pieces—one being The Cricktt on the Hearth).
Messrs. JAMES and THORNE (one run between them).
Mr. PHELPS (long stop).
Mr. HEJTRY NEVILLE (point).
Mr. ARTHUR CECIL (Captain).
Mr. DION BOUCICAULT twill appear as The Vampire, a new version
of The Umpire).
For the Authors, Messsrs. BOLTON and SAVTLLE ROWE will go in
together, and obtain two runs. Mr. PLANCHE will be Captain and
long stop. Mr. WILLS will exhibit his well-known play. Mr.
ALBEKY will also give us a notion of his play, "not out." Mr.
PALGRAYE SIMPSON will "adapt" himself to circumstances.
Mr. H. J. BTKON will make a big hit, and Mr. W. S. GILBERT several
with his Harlequin "bat." Mr. E. L. BLANCHABD, Umpire.
Messrs. FARNIE and REECE will stand in and make some good
catches. And should any assistance be wanted, a messenger will
at once be sent to fetch the Editor of Vanity Fair, T. G. BUWLKS,
or Mr. MOKTIMEJI of the Figaro, who would provide the players with
stage-directions for his Little Cricket.
Rule, Britannia!
HEBE is the latest assertion of our naval supremacy:—
"A YACHT BUN DOWN—Th« Lively, one of Her Majesty's dospatoh-
xxit*, liad landed a party at F.a»t Cowes yesterday afternoon, nnd as she wns
slewing' round to go away. »he carried away the cutwater and other parts of
he Rmal yacht Alberta. "The Lively proceeded on her course, and had not
gone far when she came into collision with a yacht that was ' lor hire or sale,'
ind immediately sank her, a portion of her nm-t only remaining above water.
This occurred iu broad daylight. Fortunately no persou was on board at the
time. The Lively then ran aground."
After showing such deadly liveliness, suicide seems quite the
correct thing. But should not such despatch-boats be called
'Happy Despatch " boats?
Branding a Buck.
MR. A. J. ROEBUCK has been made a Privy Councillor, and in that
iharacter may write "Right Honourable" before his name. But
joth as to the " right" and the "honour," under the circumstances,
opinions are likely to differ. The QUEEN is. happily, not the foun-
:ain of " right," whatever she may be of honour," in the oonven-
ional sense of the word.

travelled much?

heart, the Cape of Good Hope is as familiar to me as the platform of
Clapham Junction is to him y-clept its Station Master; and as for
Gibraltar, Malta, Canada, or Aden, why I know them all as well as
I do mine own shadow. Yes, I have been something of a traveller.
Second Diner. And have read deeply?
Cloaked Stranger. Well—yes—a little. The fact is, I am fond of
books and papers. Wherever my wanderings may have led me, I
have always found a library ready to my hand—it has formed a part
of iny dwelling-place. But do not put me down as a dreamer. In
my leisure I have learned a trade.
Third Diner. So accomplished a man must have done the State
some service?
Cloaked Stranger (modest!;/). They have told me so. When dark
clouds obscured the sun of my country's future, when the echo of
the storm came from abroad, when commerce was paralysed, and
labour found itself a drug in its own market—then men have looked
to me for help, and I have helped them.
Third Diner. And your reward for this signal service?
Cloaked Stranger (with a smile). Chiefly the approbation of my
own conscience. Nay, do not let me be ungrateful. In my public
capacity I have been treated well. My health, as the first of toasts,
has been drunk with enthusiasm at every subscription dinner, and
the QUEEN herself has gracefully and graciously acknowledged what
Her MAJESTY has been pleased to call my patriotism.
First Diner (icith au-c). Pray pardon any undue familiarity, Sir.
We had no idea we were honoured with the presence of one with so
great a claim upon our gratitude—our respect.
Cloaked Stranger. Nay, say not so. There are thousands and
thousands who have done what I have done. I only ask for kind-
ness—toleration.
Chorus of Diners. Indeed, you are too modest—you are, indeed.
Officiom Waiter. Sir, let me remove your cloak—the room is hot.

wear it. (Aside.) Dare I trust them!

business, this is too Dad!
Second Diner (more indignantly}. As I am a petty farmer, who
can scarcely spell my own name, I was never so insulted before!
Third Diner (most indignantly). As I am a quasi bagman, dis-
missed for dishonesty, things are coming to a pretty pass!
Ex-Cloaked Stranger. Nay, hear me. Look at these medals,
these wounds. I have a wife at home, and children,-too. They love
and respect me. Why should you—
[The Diners turn their backs upon him.
Officious Waiter. Now-then, you be off!
Ex- Cloaked Stranger. Why should I be treated thus? If I walk
into a place of entertainment I am told to leave; if I ask for a berth
in. a steamer I am refused the boon I crave; if I enter a church to
pray, before I have time to kneel I am hunted from the pew. In
other countries the garb I wear secures for its owner hearty welcome
and sincere respect. But here I am driven, insulted—I know not
what (excitedly). Tell me why I am treated thus?
Officious Waiter (pointing contemptuously to Ex-Cloaked Stran-
ger's uniform). Because you are a Common Soldier! Now be off!

the Landlord; and a Recruiting Sergeant, who has watched
the scene through the window, gires up his business as a
hopeless task as the Curtain falls.

Seems a very curious comment on that opti-
mistic phrase,
Peace our pressing invitation appears likely

PORTE-MONNAIE AND PISTOL.
ATTENTION has been attracted by the many
ingenious Yankee "notions" on view in the
Exhibition at Paris, especially in the depart-
ment of firearms, which contains divers highly-
improved rifles; contrivances for enabling
mankind to shoot one another as expeditiously
and easily as possible. A "notion" of this
kind, devised by a German mechanist, is on
sale at an establishment in Ludgate Circus. It
might well be called a sweet thing in firearms,
if it were not equally well deseribable as a
sweet thing in purses. It is, in fact, a com-
bination of purse and pistol, denominated, in
a Circular accompanied with illustrative dia-
grams—
rriHE REVOLVER-PURSE, patented in the
-L principal European Countries and the United
States of America.
This truly remarkable "notion" may or
may not have been derived from the original
of ROB ROY'S purse, which also concealed a
pistol, except that the pistol was not used for
the purpose of self-defence or assassination by
ROB ROY, but only caused anybody else than
ROB ROY who might open the purse, to shoot
himself. However, as to the "Revolver-
Purse," we are assured that, whether strictly
original or not—
"The Article it guite unique, A purse to all
appearances in size and manufacture (handy even
for ladies), contains hidden within its frame a five-
barrelled Revolver, which can be loaded with a five-
milimeter cartridge (Eley). In daily use, as a purse,
it simply answers that purpose; if, however, to be
employed for shooting, a pressure with the finger
upon a certain part of the frame opens a valve. A
passage is thus prepared for the bullet, aud the
trigger is also ready for action. The Pistol sends a
bullet a distance of about sixty yards. It thus be-
comes an excellent weapon of self-defence."
In the days when Hounslow Heath was in-
fested by TUBPIN, and other villains of the
same turpitude, this "article" might have
been advantageous to travellers. The sum-
mons, "Stand and deliver!" might have had a
twofold and effectual reply. The hand ex-
tending a purse to the highwayman could have
also extended a pistol; action perhaps accom-
panied by appropriate words: •— " Here, take
this purse. But first receive this shot." Now,
however, improved police arrangements, in
this country at least, nave superseded pocket-
pistols, insomuch that another sort of gentle-
man, moving in another kind of society than
the British, must be taken to be referred to in
the anticipation that—
"The Revolver-Purse being of solid make and
elegant finish, scarcely any gentleman, after becom-
ing familiar with the novelty and its usefulness, will
be without it."
"Solid make and [elegant finish," however
admirable, may not alone, perhaps, suffice to
induce the majority of gentlemen to provide
themselves with Revolver-Purses. Nor, to be

sure, could a gentleman in a drawing-room, at a theatre, at a ball, or anywhere else in
England, ordinarily have occasion to use a pistol of any description, and, in particular, a
Revolver-Purse. Still less could a lady need a purse which would be also such a protector.
But the novelty of this ingenious " notion," if not its utility, may recommend it, as a
plaything, to not a few gentlemen and ladies. Porte-monnaies inclosing pistols for the
use of ladies and gentlemen, have hitherto been generally unknown in any community in
Europe, notwithstanding that there may be creatures capable of saying that the purses
of many people commonly contain pistoles; which the bearers of them make use of to pay
their shot with.

"00K Guide up to this time had been the honest and worthy native
WINKI. He had joined us at Kumkum, but left us at Gogp. Here
he introduced his joung brother, TIDLI WINKI, who, he informed
us, would supply hia place. At first I thought they must be twins,
as TIDLI was so like WINKI.
This morning we arrived at the Great RHIOATTTTR Country. The
rivers here are wonderful. The district is mainly inhabited by the
various TEETO TALL/I tribes, who live entirely on the water.
The RHIGATTUHS include all the different races on the numerous
water-courses. The sources of the rivers can be seen from the
mountains; and though, being as they are, so beautiful, I had
scarcely the heart to call them names, yet I felt bound to include
them on my new maps (sixpence, plain; and a shilling, coloured;
and eighteenpence for the larger size, with more places in it), under
such titles as would at once remind the future traveller pi the old
home, and the new Continent, while giving him an extra relish for his
enjoyment, viz., the source on my left. I called The Fresh Elizabeth
Lazenby; the one before me, The New Reading; the one on my
right, The New Club; a grand source, to the south, I christened
The Improved Worcester, and so on. I made McSatUGGiNS undo the
labels; while the Printer's Boy, who had wanted to desert, and
sneak off, but had been watched by M'noifrcr the Detective, was
ordered to cut a few sticks—his own not included—to be placed at
different points, with the labels affixed.
The sources and re-sources of this Dark Continent are, I have
no hesitation in saying it, something fabulous! Where are the
enterprising people, who will at once start a Dark Continent Com-
pany, with me for the Manager P Here as I sit on the top of one
of the highest mountains, I meditate on the elasticity of the country,
which I see actually stretching away before me for hundreds of
miles. There it is, stretching and growing, like a young baby of a
country, as it is.
As to the mines—close to the rivers—they are absolutely pver-
loded; and in the streams themselves you absolutely see the gaining
ore on the surface. But I must be silent. Be still, my heart, until
I can form a Company.
These simple people have, at some time or other, imbibed a sort
of notion of Christianity; that is, from what I can gather, Chris-
tianity as connected with the division of tribes into parishes. 1
fancy that in very early days,—the days of the very early bird, 1
mean,—a Dutch missionary trader went astray here, lost on the
coast, with a cargo of Dutch metal. He was, I imagine, from their
hazy traditions, a Baptist, accompanied by his wife, ANNA. Baptist.
The tribes are divided by the rivers into parishes, called Water-
kures, under charge of a sort of Reverend Overseer, called a
Waterkurit. The one thing remarkable in their legends is the
absence of all that is beneficent in the supernatural.
The Teeto Totalla tribes do not believe in the existence of any
hut bad spirits. Yet they are superstitious, and believe firmly in
the efficacy of philtres—but they are all water philtres—and each
stream has its own charms for those who visit it.
The men of the lihigaUur tribe—including their Reverend Water-
kurits—ture much addicted to spells on the river.
"And," I asked of their Chief Splashur—a sort of Episcopus in
partibus aquarum, or 'Bishop of Bath and Wells,' which is much
the same thing—as we sat after our quiet rubber, which succeeded
an evening bathe, and, as he was always losing, considerably, re-
stored my circulation, just then getting rather low, "do you not
believe in The Immeasurable Good?"
He sliook his head gravely—he has a large head, as have most
of these Teeto Tallas, owing, I fancy, to the constant water on the
brain—as their heads are full of it—and, after assuming his Dis-
cussion Cap, replied,
"No; not in The Immeasurable Good: but we fully believe in the
Immense Well."
I was beginning to feel rather dry. Theological argument gene-
rally has that effect on me; in fact, as a rule, I never commence
it until the third bottle after dinner. Besides, I wanted to convert
him. How much this poor man lost through his utter ignorance of
the supernatural!—not the bad in the supernatural world, but the
Good Spirits, the pure Spirits, which will dp no mortal any harm!
"But," I went on, "do you absolutely disbelieve in the existence
of spirits in this country."
"There are none," he replied.
"Then," I remarked slily, "some one 'does' your duties."
"No," he replied simply, "what duties there are for me to do, I
do myself. As a matter of fact there are none to do."
I didn't believe him, the old rascal, for his nose was as red as a
glowing coal. However, I was in a hurry to be off out of such an
anomalous country—a dry country full of water—and so I said,
"Well, your Reverence. you''ll just square up for that last
rubber "—it had been double dummy—" and 1 'm off."
He couldn't. He oughtn't to have played. I knew it, and
threatened to expose him. He implored for mercy, as exposure
would ruin himself and family. "Would I," he asked, "take it
out in water?" I reflected. I fancied I saw what he meant by the
twinkle of his old eye. I looked him full in the face, and said with
intention,
"I will take it out in water, and I will take it in in water, and it
you '11 only give me sufficient, I will promise to leave the country at
once, and not say a word to a soul on the subject."
He put his finger to his nose.
"I believe," he said, " in the existence of bad spirits; but there is
also the Great Water Spirit, who is good and generous, and who is
only known to a very few here; you understand, jolly companions,
every one I"
"Exactly so," I returned, capping his quotation, and we won t
go home till morning. I 'm fly.'
He took me to his Water- Kurasee, and showed me in a secret cave
some water-kuraso, the knowledge of whose existence is confined
entirely to the superior clergy. After bargaining with him for a
couple of bottles, he then showed me into another cellar which he
said was the abode of the Good Water Spirit, Oderee.
"Good, ain't it?" he asked, as I sipped it.
"Superb," I replied, handing my glass to be refilled. "Odevee

tor ever!
We drank each other's health. We toasted "absent friends, and
long might they be so!"
'rThis is jolly," said the Arch-Waterkurit, tossing off his fafth
glass.
"Very," I replied, keeping pace with his movements, " and so
quiet! Not a soul to disturb us."
I had just gone on to a fresh tap, when, from behind a cask, stepped
forward a figure, bottle in hand, and at first quite unrecognisable by
his best friends, being so completely disguise! in liquor.
Recovering my self-possession, and uncovering in the presence of
a visitor, I took off my hat and said as distinctly as I could, my
accent having become affected by the constant use of outlandish
languages, " Mishter SHTANLEY, I pr'shume."
The man staggered forward. It was M'YIONYT the Detective.
(Private Diary. I have made up my mind to get rid of M'TIOSTC on
the first opportunity. I took him as a detective on purpose to find
out STANLEY or anybody else, and he is always detecting me. I re-
monstrated with him this morning:, but he says he can't help it; it's
in him, and that's how he makes his money. He got a good round
sum out of the Arch-Waterkurit, of whom he threatened to tell,
calling as witnesses myself and McSMC&oiNS, who, as a Ventriloquist,
can always command several voices, and we, in the interesta pi
morality, backed him up, and then when the Arch-Waterkurit paid
over the coin, and surrendered several bottles of Odevee on con-
dition of our secresy and leaving the country at onoe, Old M'YIONTTJ
wouldn't divide until he eaid> " we had got well away." Now he has
got well away, and I can't find him anywhere. The Ventriloquist
is still with me. Also the Printer's Boy. We daren't go back to the
Rhigattur Country as the Arch-Waterkurit, and all his officials
have been preaching against us, and the people are tremendously
incensed—though this, I believe, is an ordinary portion of the
religious rites.)
Inaven't made much by this journey. Wish I could come up
with STANLEY.
I should have gone on with it myself, but that I was preparing a
paper for the British Ass-Spciation, to be read when called for. It is
A Note on a Perspiring Tribe slowly melting away under a Tropical
Sun on the STERIO SKOPPICO frontier." The people of this tribe are
known as Fotos. There are bad Fotos, good Fotos, and indifferent
Fotos—human nature being pretty much alike everywhere. Their
creed is divided into Positivism and Negativism. I am generally
opposed to anything resembling the Slave Trade, but as I was not
allowed to take a Foto, without paying for the privilege, I bought
one. Life is valueless among these strange people, and often in_a
morning's walk have I seen as many as a hundred Fotos hung up in
a public place.
I am informed that their views of marriage are superstitious in
the extreme ; one of the parents giving her consent with reluctance, as
the sacrifice of a mother-in-law is considered an act of heroic virtue.

Extract from Diary.—This evening sent letter to England by Black Mail, asking for cheque on
account. Exploration must come to an end, if cheque doesn't arrive. Mine is an un-chequered exist-
ence at present. 1 have drawn for the Editor a touching picture of our wretched state; I wish the
Editor would draw something that would touch me. Then how about the Proprietors'( I 've got reams
of their advertisements to stick all over the Keep-it-Dark Continent—just to enlighten them—but I
can't use them without paste. How to make paste without the tin? Impossible. If they only knew
what they are losing. And how about that friend in the North to whom they telegraphed and who
wired back " Yes" 1
There are several political water-parties in the Rhigattur country, but they are included under two
heads, the Torpids and the Rapids.
The only crimes ever committed here are known as " Aquarian Outrages," and generally arise from
envy of a Torpid, in consequence of some more than usually dashing action of the Rapids, when he will
go out in a boat at night with a gun for the purpose of shooting one of the Rapids, in which nefarious
design he generally succeeds, but not without considerable personal risk.
Ilut I am expecting somc'.tcturn, per the Black Mail, who has left this evening for Enp-lnml.*

THE BLACK MAIL (STARTING). LEVYING TUB ULACK HAIL.
This explains why he never arrived. From a drawing
taken on the spot. The two villains ore probably
M'YIONYV and McSMfooiNB in disguise.
We returned to Jarnziribar. Then came the moment of settling up with my merry men. This
lasted some time, as I had to go into all the accounts very carefully before I could declare a dividend.
On the afternoon of the fifth day I published a report, showing'a clear profit to everybody at the rate
of 1-2J per cent, per annum on the takings throughout the tour, includingthe race with Old Scratch, the
Dark Horse, and the entertainment at Mossi.
The total amount I proposed to carry forward as far as England, where, being properly invested,
the dividend would be considerably increased.
In order to put this plan into successful operation as speedily as possible I set to work to pack
up all the coin in bags previous to setting sail. Sad and subdued were the faces of those I saw looking
in and flattening their noses against the panes of the windows, which were"as firmly closed as the doors.
How could I satisfy all the claims? Except in one way, and on this I decided.
The Printer's Boy, who was as amenable to kicks as to halfpence, assisted me in my manoeuvre, and
M'noNYU, the Detective, also gave me the greatest possible help, though unconsciously.
I called M'YIONTO to me, and having thanked him in a set speech, and complimented him on his
personal appearance and his generally meritorious conduct, I presented him with a cheque on the
United Alliance Greenland Bank Company for double the amount claimed, begging him to get it cashed
early next morning, so as to be beforehand with McSirr/GGiNS. Then I summoned the latter gentle-
man, and explaining to him that he had merited well of his country, I wrote him a draft on the
North Bank (Regent's Park Branch), and requesting him not to mention the circumstance to M'riojrnj,
I gave him, as an extra douceur, my best suit of reversible travelling clothes, my expanding hat,
patent umbrella, and all complete.
As I had expected, he at once set out to see what could bo done with the draft, but, it being late at
night, there was no chance of his cashing it in Jarnziribar; so he immediately started to make the
best of his way back to Mossi. where he thought the soft-headed tribes would cash his cheque, or
give him beads, gold, a farm and cattle, in exchange.
Then followed exactly what I had anticipated. All the people who had been bothering me with
their claims, and who had been hanging about my camp-office all day, seeing (as they fudged by my
clothes, hut, and mnbrella) me on horseback, galloping on in the direction of the far West hills, at once
procured every available animal, cart, chaise, bathing-machine, anything on wheels, or on four legs,
and gave chase. Away went McSitcociNs, like Johnny Gilpin, and away went everyone in Jarnziribar
(who had pretended claims on me) after him. M'noi*YU was employed to pursue the fugitive, and
as the job was made worth his while, he went for him.
In the meantime. I and the Printer's Boy put the Arkadia together, and in the silent night,
with beating hearts full of gratitude, wo entered the rowing compartment boat of our tight and trim
craft, The Arkadia.
• Nott by Editor.—f\xa Messenger never arrived. We wish he had, as we should then have known what to do.
Pray accept apologies; but this will explain apparent neglect.
As we were launching it into
the deep, a small crowd of brave
fellows rushed down to render
some assistance. They pushed us
off, and we pushed them off.
Then, as they clung on to the boat
affectionately, we shook their
hands heartily, detaching them
from the boat's sides with a
walking-stick and a boat-hook
as quietly as possible, or, as our
sail was hoisted, and the breeze
was already propelling us at the
rate of twenty knots an hour, the
poor fellows might have been
carried away miles to seaward,
and Heaven knows what might
have happened to them—and, by
the way, Heaven only knows
what did, as, perhaps, like my
Costa Rica Stock, they may have
gone down to rise no more. They
deserved a better fate: I wish
they may get it.
But regrets are useless. We
were away, at last, on the bound-
ing and boundless ocean, and as
with swelling sails, and bursting
hearts, we went with the gale for
the Bay of Biscay oh (or some-
where else), we waved a long
farewell to Jarnziribar, and at
one A.M., with a southerly wind,
and a cloudy sky proclaiming a
sailing morning, the wind blowing
well from the Coast and out to
sea, we felt all the joy of a moon-
light trip without any of the ex-
pense, and at one A.M. The Off-
to-find-Stanley Expedition was
no more. The rest is silence; I
have no cue for going on, and so,
as I want the rest, I take it.

last spoke.
CRIME AND CACKLE.
A DEPUTATION of a somewhat mixed character lately waited upon
Mr. Punch, ostensibly to seek his opinion, but more manifestly to _ _., _
state their own, upon criminal discipline in general, and the new ; when he'was comfortable.
Prison Rides in par-
ticular. The deputa-
tion was introduced,
in alengthy and mag-
niloquent speech, by
Mr. Commissioner
CACKLE.
This gentleman
took occasion—and
about half-an-hour
—to say that having
considered the ques-
tion from the psy-
chological, physio-
logical, and aesthetic
points of view, he
had embodied his
opinion in a brief
essay of forty pages
or so, which, with
Mr. Punch's per-
mission, he would
proceed to read. Mr.
launch hinting that
precis might be pre-
ferable to full peru-
sal, Mr. CACKLE
became learnedly ob-
scure upon "physio-
logical rest, the
"struggle for survi-
val," the "golden
mean," and the
comparative effects
of work and worry
upon the criminal
mind, his conclu-
sions being conveyed
in language almost
dithyrambiCj and il-
lustrated with nu-
merous quotations
from the Latin
Grammar and the
Imperial Speaker.
His opinion, so far
as it could be
gathered from a
rambling rhapsody,
seemed to be that the
criminal's chronic
malady of " physio-
logical rest" should
be treated with a
sparse diet of beans
and fat bacon; and
that the best cure
for a too easy con-
science was an un-
comfortable couch.
Mr. GUSHDTGTON
FUDGE considered
that a pharisaical
brute like the last
speaker was more
deserving of bare
plank and wooden-
pillow discipline
than many a poor
so-called criminal.
Criminals were the
creatures of circum-
stances and the vic-
tims of Society.
Society, like another
Frankenstein ^ was driven by fear and disgust into taking harsh
measures against the monster itself had brought into being. Society
owed a duty of care, and kindness, and delicate consideration to
the criminal classes, but Mr. CROSS and his myrmidons were re-
viving the traditions of TOBQUESLADA'S torture chamber. Moral
suasion was the only panacea for the spiritual eccentricity called
crime; the regimen of discomfort and short commons was as futile
as it was barbarous.
Mr. WILLIAM SIKES 'ad the 'onour of agreein' with the party as

CHERUBIC.
"Is THAT GREAT-GRANDPAPA, AUNTIE DEAR?"—"YES. THAT'S GREAT-GRANDPAPA !•"
"AND WAS GREAT-GRANDPAPA CLEVER?"—"VERT CLEVKK, INDEED!"
"AND WAS GREAT-GRANDPAPA VERY GOOD'"—"VERT, VBRY GOOD!"
"AND IS THAT ALL THERE WAS OF GREAT-GRANDPAPA?"
He, himself, never felt so inclined to be wirtuous as
Skilly and tokc always put his back up,
and a 'ard pillow
sent him on the ram-
page sooner than
anythink, 'cept a
nagging woman. A
poor cove wanted
leisure and rest to
repent, work and
worry only spiled
his chance of con-
wersion.
Mr. TIJION SNAP
said that the cordial
agreement of the last
two speakers was as
natural in itself as
conclusive against
their view of the
case. When a fool
and a scoundrel
joined in commend-
ing the same thing,
it was clear that
things must be un-
mitigatedly bad.
Humanitarian deal-
ing with the criminal
classes was perni-
cious rot. (Groans
from Mr. SIXES.)
Make it hot for
them! That was the
only way. (Snorts
from Mr. GrsHiso-
TON FUDGE.) Fine
cookery and cosset-
ting for criminals
were an insult to
common sense and
a premium upon
crime. The only
fault of the New
Prison Rules was
that they were not
half severe enough.
Mr. Commissioner
CACKLE was about
to reply, when Mr.
Punch peremptorily
cut him short by
remarking that
bunkum verbosity
in the style of an
amateur essayist,
might do for a Par-
liamentary Blue
Book, but not for
his pages. He (Mr.
Punch) had pa-
tiently heard them,
and he had the
honour to disagree
with them all round.
Doctrinaire fustian,
maudlin muddle-
headedness, cynic
shallowness, and
criminal cant had
all had their turn,
but common sense
seemed not yet to
have found voice on
this question. Mr.
CACKLE had talked
of the "golden
mean," but he had certainly not hit it. It lay somewhere between
plank pillows, which savoured of brutality, and pious petting,
which was full-blown folly. If Home Secretaries and Commis-
sioners could not discover it, and that without high faluting
rhetoric and Latin quotations, they had better give what they
considered their minds to prize essays, or penny readings, and

the matter in hand—which it seemed likely he •would
have to do—they might depend upon it that the results
would he in accordance with the carefully-balanced
claims of common sense and enlightened humanity, and
therefore profoundly unsatisfactory to the persons com-
posing the deputation, as egregious types of the classes

Ix the event of the above coming off, it is understood—
That, on assembling for the transaction of business,

the Standing Committee, one by one, for the possession

That the said Committee will be elected by revolver at
a general meeting of the entire Congress, at which one
black or white bail, well delivered, will be considered as
exel uding;
That everybody who does not insult the Chair on rising,
will bo regarded as "out of order," and immediately

That as a protest against the "diplomatic" proceed-

That no resolution shall be regarded as worth anything

That, after the American fashion, all decisions of the

Foreign Office, who was exiled to Siberia immediately after he had finished copying
the papers relating to the Anglo-Russian Memorandum, under the apprehension, no doubt,

nature to embarrass seriously Her Britannic
Majesty's Government should, its real nature
become known, it is agreed between the high
contracting parties that His Imperial Majesty
consents to a Treaty being concluded between
Her Britannic Majesty and the SULTAIT, by
which the former shall guarantee to the latter
the possession of all that part of Asia Minor
which His Imperial Majesty the EHPEBOR of
all the RUSSIAS has no desire to incorporate
in his dominions; it being understood—
Firstly, that Her Majesty's Government
shall not oppose the taking of Batoum, Ears,
and the country intervening.
Secondly, that Her Majesty's Government
shall neither give itself nor His Imperial Ma-
jesty's Government any further trouble about
that portion of the Turkish Empire which
lies north of the Bosphorus.
Thirdly, that Her Majesty's Government
shall take possession, with or without the con-
sent of the SULTAN, of any or all the islands in
the Eastern Mediterranean, and, if necessary,
any _ lands in Asia Minor bordering on tie
Mediterranean, and extending inland as far
as may be requisite, Her Majesty's Government
being invited to come to an understanding
with the various independent tribes who may
become involved in the operations arising out
of the validation of said guarantees.
Fourthly, that in case the annexation of
Asia Minor should become in the opinion of
Her Majesty's Government necessary or de-
sirable, His Imperial Majesty declares in ad-
vance that such step is not in the least opposed
to any Russian interests or plans, and that
His Imperial Majesty will in no manner,
secretly or openly, exert any influence in oppo-
sition to such annexation. And—
Fifthly, as the knowledge of the existence of
the foregoing agreement may be dangerous to
the stability of Her Majesty's present Govern-
ment, and prejudicial to the success of the
Conservative party at the next General Elec-
tion, His Imperial Majesty pledges himself to
take every step customary in his dominions to
secure absolute secresy as to these negotia-
tions; and both the high contracting parties
promise to cause the official papers of both
realms to profess, within moderate limits, a
determined hostility to the plans of the res-
pectively opposing Governments.* And His
Imperial Majesty in particular agrees to give
orders to his journals to express any desir-
able degree of indignation at the diplomatic
victories of Her Majesty's Government, and at
the humiliation of Russia, it being understood
per contra that the tone of the English
Government journals shall be kept within
certain respectful limits, and moderated at the
demand of His Imperial Majesty's Govern-
ment, should their remarks cause any agita-
tion in the Governments of Moskow or Vilna.
Finally, His Imperial Majesty solemnly
agrees to withdraw all subsidy from Mr.
GLADSTONE, Mr. E. A. FREEMAN, the Northern
Echo, and the Daily News, and to exert no
influence on behalf of the Liberal party at the
next General Election, it being agreed that
Her Majesty's present Government shall con-
sult the interests of His Imperial Majesty as
fully as a Liberal Government could in any
case.

certain West End Clubs—
where play, depending on
temperature, rises from £2
to £1000, when somebody
"gets it hot," and where,
it appears, a dishonoured
cheque in quittance of a loss
is notpositively unknown—
Sir WILLIAM ROSE, by the
kind permission of Mr.
GEORGE LEWIS, made the
following observation :—
"It is my opinion that the
police ought to make some in-
quiries respecting these pro-
prietary Clubs, which appear to
me to be nothing else than
hells—hells of the worst des-
cription—in which all sorts of
gambling are carried on. The
police are supposed to protect
us against suun things; and
certain! v it seems to me that
such places ought not to be
allowed to exist in this metro-
polis."
Sir WILLIAM asked, in effect, "What are the police about? How
is it they allow Noblemen and Gentlemen to gamble in ' hells of the
worst description' without interfering and taking the whole lot of
them into custody?" Ah, Sir WILLIAM, do not be too hard on the
police! You must already have noticed, that, if a trifle remiss in a
fashionable quarter of the .town, they can be most rigid in the exe-
cution of their duty in a less aristocratic neighbourhood, for in the
very next column of the Daily Telegraph, parallel with the report
from which the above quotation has been made, I find :—
"SOUTHWABK.—GAMBLING.—Three youths, named SIMMONS, CONXOR,
and GOODMAX, living at Bermondsey, were convicted of gambling with cards
in Cross Street, on Sunday. GOODMAX and CONNOR were sentenced to six
days' and SIMMOXS to three days' hard labour."
Now, Sir WILLIAM, let us suppose these names to be Lord SIM-
MONS, the Hon. Mr. CONNOR, and Colonel GOODMAN, substitute the
Berkeley Club for Bermondsey, and would there have been any
interference on the part of the police?
We haven't many fine summer evenings in the year for al fresco
entertainments, but we might make the best use of them when they
do come. I was at Antwerp the other evening, and from seven to ten
(they 're an early people fe« braces Beiges] the Zoological Gardens were
thronged by tout ce qu'il y a de plus beau in Anvers. promenading,
or sitting about, or taking their cool drinks at comfortably-placed
small tables while listening to a first-rate orchestra. Is this impos-
sible in London? The animals at Antwerp didn't appear sad when
they heard sweet music. There was no howling, or baying the gas,
when at 8'30 they commenced lighting up. Why can't our Zoological
Gardens, Regent s Park, step out and do likewise? The old Surrey
Zoological used to. But that's past and gone; and they never hod

can't get into the country has " done 'em all" long ago. Light up
the Zoo from 8'30 till 11'30. No fireworks: small tables: good
attendance: cooling drinks, also coffee. Good music, such as is
played at feeding time at the Holborn Restaurant, by Mr. RLPLEY'S
Orchestra: no dancing: only promenading. Who'll object? The
Sloth?
Here is a line, from a couplet, which is frequently quoted:—
"Qu'importe le flacon, pourvu qu'on ait 1'ivresse."
The Author is ALFRED DE MUSSET: but it strikes me the senti-
ment is more like what might be expected from an ALFRED DE
MUZZY. Under this nom de plume I shall take to writing Bacchana-
lian songs.
The eminent Comedian, Mr. TOOLE, has lately visited Paris. The
first place he wanted to see was the Tooley-rees, "where," he was
informed, "Too' le monde goes." No more Jeux de mote on this
subject: this being the ultima Tooley.
To those who are pining for sea-air, and who are unable to obtain
the genuine air-tickle, I recommend the following process: Steep a
pocket-handkerchief in Solution of Essence of Ifarina Brinina;
stand in an open space out of doors—anywhere will do; the centre
of Regent Circus, or Trafalgar Square, for choice,—face the breeze,
and apply the handkerchief to the nose.—your own, of course. You
will thus obtain all the exhilarating advantages, without any of the
attendant expense. In anticipation of all anxious inquiries as to
where the Solution of Essence of Marina Brinina can be obtained. I
can only reply that it is my own Invention, and that none will be
genuine unless signed by the Inventor. The solution of the problem
"where to get it" is mst the solution I cannot provide you with.
But after this advice all I can say to my readers is, that I recommend
them to try and get it, and / wish they may.
The Adelphi "Proof" has been " corrected " to advantage. I men-
tioned the advertisement last week as to the " remounting" and
MR. NEVILLE'S performance of Pierre Lorance, which is, in my
opinion, even better than DUMAINE'S rendering of the original at
the Porte St. Martin. Mr. NEVILLE is certainly the right man in the
right place. Miss BELLA PATEMAN is as exoellent as she was on
the first night, and Mrs. BANDMANN is far better, bringing down the
house with the curtain, at the end of the Fifth Act. Mrs. ARTHUR
STIRLING, as the Directress of the College, denounces the impostor
with electrical effect j and so thoroughly villanous is her husoand,
Mr. ARTHUR STIRLING, as Lazare, that when he appears before the
curtain, the audience is divided between cheering and hooting the
sham Count, whose ultimate destination is to share the fate of the
"unfortunate nobleman now languishing," Ac.—which cause celebre
in England probably suggested to the Authors, Messrs. D'ENNERT
and CORMON, the idea of routing out and dramatising some similar
case in the French Newgate Calendar. This is Mr. NEVILLE'S second
Ticket of Leaee Mini. Good omen.
Mr. WREN, the well-known private Coach for the Civil Service
Examination has lately shown us in the papers what a good propor-
tion of his pupils have passed the winning-post, and won the Com-
petitive Stakes. Let them be henceforth Known as " The Wren
JBoys"—and with a far more satisfactory claim to the title. His
Boys will look back on their "WREN" as the architect of their
fortunes. He charges Mr. PEHCIVAL, Head Master of Clifton, -with
playing " Cuckoo" to the fledglings of the Wren's nest.
There is some excellent acting by MLLE. BEATRICE'S Company
(Limited) at the Olympic Theatre, in A Woman of the People, spe-
cially on the part, or rather in the parts of Dr. Leblanc (Mr. GEORGE

Mr. STIRLING above mentioned, is nightly called before the curtain
to receive the reward of his villany. The Members of the Company
plav well together under the superintendence of their Manageress, and
with Benedick I say, " Fair BEATRICE, I thank you for your pains."
Mrs. CROWE (Miss BATEMAN) has been draining tiers, at the
Lyceum, as Mary Warner. The Moors have made a pretty clean

BORING FOR WATER.
THE Municipal Authorities of Manchester are respectfully invited,
to take notice that Messrs. DOCWRA AND SONS, commissioned by the
Admiralty and instructed by Professor RAMSAY, have bored a well
at Chatham, down through the gault to the lower green sand, at a
depth of 903 feet; whence the purest of drinking -water ascends to
the surface and bubbles over. Also that a similar well, sunk at
Ixmghton, Epping Forest, to the lower green sand likewise, 1093 feet
deep, yields an ample water-supply. Of course the only reason why
Manchester is not supplied with water too from an Artesian well, is
that Geology does not allow it. There we must presume that water
cannot be got. at by boring to any possible depth, for what would
that be in comparison with so monstrous a bore as the enormity of
spoiling, if not abolishing, Thirlmere Lake, by turning it into a
reservoir?

BIRTHS AND BEGGING-LETTERS.
MR. PUNCH, SIR,
BIENNIALLY, or thereabouts, an addition is
usually made to my domestic happiness. I ought to be
a happy man. Well, I don't find a birth always so great
a bore as it is in some households. In my newspaper I
observe, "A MOTHER OF A FAMILY" complains that the
"arrival of a newly-born ini'ant," announced amongst
the "Births," invariably subjects her to a troublesome
influx of letters and parcels enclosing a variety of goods
such as babies' shoes, knitted shawls, embroidered pocket-
handkerchiefs, and useless articles of fancy-work. Some
of them purport to come on behalf of churchbuilding
and charities from "clergymen's wives," others from
"ladies in reduced circumstances," and all request a re-
mittance of stamps, or of business orders, in return.
I can corroborate all this. My own wife's experience
is always exactly the same as "A MOTHER OF A
FAMILY'S." But it never annoys either her or myself
in the least. On the contrary, we make both profit and
fun out of it. I will tell you what I do with all the
commodities poured in upon us.
All of those things that are in anywise useful, I use,
or keep.
All that are useless I burn, unless they are postable.
In that case I carefully return them to their senders,
without reply, in unstamped envelopes.
In like manner enclosed I take particular care to post
back the whole of the begging-letters.
Applications for payment or return of consignments,
how frequently soever repeated, I take no notice of.
This, Sir, is how I, for my part, systematically deal
with duffers accustomed, of course, cynically to scan the
"Births, Marriages, and Deaths''(the "Deaths" as
well as the "Births" and the "MariageSj" and also
the Guidc-Books and professional Directories), for the
purpose of getting at people by name and address, pre-
sumably in positions nnd circumstances which lay them
open to have a rise taken out of them, and be preyed
upon by means of playing on their softer feelings, and
still more soft intellects, such as they have. Let me
recommend those that have any, to try and cope with
their crafty correspondents in the same way that I tackle
the like who attempt to put a plant on me. Some people
may consider it unscrupulous; let them. I myself, mean-
while, enjoy the sanction of inward self-complacency,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JACK SPRATTS.
A'^Tale of Modern Art and Fashion.

PART I.
IK a beautiful old suburb of London, undesecrated, as yet, by-
steam or telegraph-wires, and surrounded by low-lying flowery
meads, through which the Thames would still meander occasionally,
as it had been wont to do in clays long gone by, dwelt JACK SPMATT,
a handsome, genial, and simple-minded young painter. He had a
girl-wife oi lofty stature, and truly transcending loveliness, a gift
of which she seemed as yet unconscious.
They were unknown to fame, and not of exalted birth; but they
had refined tastes, pretty manners, and affectionate dispositions, and
were unto each other even as the apple of the eye. Their united
ages amounted to thirty-nine brief summers. They had twins (a
boy and a girl), as beautiful as the day, whom they loved with
an exceeding love, and who loved them back again with all the
singleness of their two little child hearts, that beat as one.
"Oh, really quite too fortunate! . had they but known" (as VIRGIL
would no doubt have exclaimed, had he but been an Englishman,
and lived to make the acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs. J. SPRATT)!
Their house was of red brick, smothered in ivy, and had been built
about Queen ANNE'S time, or before, and never repaired since, nor
meddled with in any way whatever. It stood by itself in a small
old-fashioned garden, surrounded by once peach-laden walls that
crumbled to the touch, and overrun with nettles, thistles, marigolds,
sunflowers, and poppies; a trellised arbour of sweet pea half buried a
sun-dial in its fragrant gloom; and there was a nice little green pond.
Apple-trees and pear-trees, leafless and long past fruit-bearing, but
beautifully gnarled, grew rank as in an orchard, and on to a luxu-
riant lawn that had never known the scythe, opened the pretty
studio, which was full of blue china, round mirrors, faded tapestry,
carved oak-chests, high-backed chairs, brazen sconces, mediaeval
arms and armour, an organ with beautifully painted pipes but no
bellows, and other musical instruments, such as sackbuts and
psalteries, a harpsichord without any strings, and a dulcimer that
had been txirned into an eight-day clock, but could never be got to
go. The dust la^ thick on all these pretty things, and toned them
into harmony. Studio, house, and garden were pervaded with a
subtle fragrance, significant 9f old associations, which arose in the
soft summer twilight from time-honoured, ruined, and all but for-
gotten drains.
JACK SPRATT also gloried in the possession of two beautiful and
costly lay figures, representing a mother and a child, the only modern
objects in the house, whose open countenances and curiously-wrought
limbs, duly draped, he would never tire of painting, while his lovely
wife sat by, darning his socks, may be, or embroidering some quaint
device, as she read to him aloud old tales of chivalry, to which he
was extremely partial, while the twins frolicked at her pretty feet.
This work done, after a frugal meal of bread and honey in the
in lamb-like innocence around.
They made a pretty picture, these happv children, and their beau-
tiful young mother, and the trees, and the grass, and the winding
river, bathed in the glories of eventide; and in the midst of it all,
JACK SPRATT would be inspired to close his eyes, and reverently,
regretfully, recall to mind the grand old sunsets, by the jrrand Old
Masters, in the National Gallery, and the quaint old children and
mothers by BOGOFOGO, ANTIMA CASSARO, VECCHIO COCCOLORO, FRA
STOGGIATO DI VERMICELLI, SARSAPAHILLO DELLO STRANDO, and other
painters of that ante-pra-Raphaelite school; and, in the depths of
his bliss, a feeling of discouragement would steal over him as he
thought of those immortal works, showing thereby that he was a
true artist, ever striving after the light. He little dreamt in his
modesty, that, young and inexperienced though he might be, his
pictures were even quainter than theirs; for not only could he
already draw, colour, compose, and put into perspective quite as
badly as they did, but he had over them the advantage of a real lay
figure to copy, whereas they had to content themselves with the
living model.
The amusements of this happy pair were of the simplest, healthiest,
and most delightful kind; they never went to the play, nor to balls
or dances, which they thought immodest—(indeed they were not even
asked)—nor read such things as novels, magazines, or the newspaper;
nor visited exhibitions of modern art, which they held in contempt, as
they did all things modern; but they skipped, with single and double
rope, and played battledore and shuttlecock, and hunt the slipper,
and puss in the corner, and hide-and-seek, and such like little inno-
cent old games; and they were devoted to music, not that of the

Mysterious Stranger (introducing himself). "AH—I 'VE SECURED A CBAIIMINO SITE FOR MYSELF IN THE NEW CEMETERY,

[Mrs. T., alarmed, rushes off with her Children; and Trestles remarked at his Club (the "Scarf and Truncheon," in Hatchment Alley),

present day, which they despised, nor that of the future, of which
they had never heard; nor English music, which was not old enough;
but music of the early continental school, with nice easy tunes, which
they could learn to sing in unison, and early French and Italian
words, which appealed to their fond hearts with all the hidden
power of a language they loved but did not understand. Their
voices were musical and low. They sang even the liveliest ditties
to a slow sad measure of their own, and in the sweet but homely
accent of their native London. The reader can hardly realise the
effects that early French or Italian strains of a festive nature, with
festive words to match, can produce on a musical Frenchman or
Italian of the present day, when rendered in this unsophisticated
manner by such performers as Mr. and Mrs. JACK SPBATT.
They were not without friends, carefully chosen on the combined
principles of natural and Hobsonian selection. They were few, but
true and trusty, with remarkably fine heads for a painter; their
gait, gestures, grammar, and personal habits were mediaeval; their
deportment grave, sad, and very strange; for the death of the early
Italian Masters still weighed on their souls with all the force of some
recent domestic bereavement, and they always behaved with the
solemnity that befitted them as chief mourners, speaking of the dead
in hushed and reverential whispers; not that they conversed very
freely or very often; they were much given to long periods of
thoughtful silence, which were held sacred by each other, and only
broken now and then by flashes of a sad strange merriment, that
would have puzzled an outsider immensely. But, buoyed up as they
were by brave hopes of the past and a firm faith in better days
gone by, they were not unhappy. They looked on themselves, and
each other, and the JACK SPRATTS, and were looked upon by the
JACK SPRATTS in return, as the sole incarnation on this degenerate
earth of all such good as had still managed to survive there; and so
they were always telling each other, and everyone else they met.
And no wonder, for they were marvellously accomplished; being
each of them painter, sculptor, architect, p^jet, critic, and engraver,
all in one; and all this without ever having learnt, but through a
mere effort of the will, and by mutual consent, as it were; and if
you were to mention to them the name of any world-renowned fol-
lower of any of those arts in the present day, they would coldly
reply:—" We don't know any painters!" or, We don't know any
poets!" as the case might be, and walk off in an opposite direction;
and after that you would find it very difficult to continue the con-
versation.
As for the Royal Academy, they held it in merely passive contempt,
and were satisfied with never having heard the names of its most
celebrated members. Their especial scorn was reserved for that school
of Art which finds its home on the walls of the Grosvenor Gallery;
they regarded its disciples as renegades, and its gifted leader as a
base apostate, who, having once known the better way, had chosen
to depart from it, and had been branded in consequence with the
indelible Hall Mark of ineffaceable popular renown. In extenuation
of such extreme views, it must be admitted that the authorities of
the Grosvenor Gallery had not invited JACK SPEATT and his trusty
friends to exhibit there; not through any ill-will, but because they
had never heard of them.
Their appearance in the streets of busy London was in no way
remarkable, for they walked abroad in shapeless hats, long cloaks,
and cheap garments of an ordinary reach-me-down description; but
often, when they met at the JACK SPKATTS' in the gloaming, or at
evensong, or Curfew time, as they would alternately call it, they
would doff their ponchos, slijj their ready-made trousers, and dis-
play themselves, regardless of expense, in the outward bravery of
that early Italian tune they held so dear; and all this without ever
departing from the grave and impressive demeanour that was
habitual to them.
Far be it from Mr. Punch, who has a young and mirthful heart,
to make his mock of such masquerading; indeed, he is not above
such masquerading himself, although in a somewhat more frolicsome
and facetious spirit. It is his pleasure to know a certain Artistic
set (not a mutual admiration society, by any means) who have a
fondness for the early Georgian period, and live near to each other

in mansions built about that time, and furnished accordingly; they
are young and prosperous, and without care; and it sometimes suits
their mood, of a winter's evening, to meet at each other's houses in
the ruffles and knee-breeches, the powder and patches, of that
frivolous but graceful time. The Ladies of this society happen to
be fair to the eye. and, like the Gentlemen, accomplished musicians,
and persons of a lively wit; and Mr. Punch has occasionally graced
these parties in his own person, duly arrayed in a plum-coloured
suit that belonged to his step-great-grandfather-in-law. with knee-
breeches, black silk stockings, and buckled shoes (he has :i well-
turned leg and ankle, has Mr. P.; what the French call " lajambe
de cour "); and he vows and protests that he has never seen or heard
anything prettier than a stringed qnartett of HAYTW'S or MOZART'S
tastefully performed by these ruffled amateurs, while their patched
and powdered Ladies sat by, looked on and listened; after which
Mr. Punch, who can sing " Phillitlu Fltmtx .!/«" with genuine taste
and feeling, has contributed his share to the evening's amusement;
and then they have all joined in a gay minuet, and exchanged snuff-
boxes and epigrams, and elegantly worded compliments; and Mr.
Punch, who nas also graced the bats costumes at all the Courts in
Europe, including our own, has never beheld anything half so merry
or charming as these powder parties.
But to return to the SPRATTS. Sorrow and sickness seldom visit
those who lead such pure, simple, and innocent lives. In their hours
of sorrow, the SPRATTS and their friends would lind comfort in gazing
at some pretty combination of form and colour; such as a dead frog
lying on a blue china plate in the sun, or a cracked sackbut with a
peacock's feather sticking out of its bung-hole. Their only abiding
grief was a hideous red pillar-post which stood outside the gates of
their pretty dwelling; and so much did they loathe this undeeorative
object, that thev never used it, on principle, but even in bad weather
would walk half a mile to post such few letters as they ever had
occasion to write. Indeed, most of these had been written to the
Vestry, demanding that the pillar-post should be removed, on the
score of its unsisrhtliness, and offering to replace it by a new sun-
dial, designed, free of charge, by JACK SPRATT, from the old one in
his arbour, on condition that the parish should bear the expense of
the original material, its carving according to JACK SPRATT'S design,
and its subsequent erection. But the Vestry had taken no notice of
these appeals.
In their hours of sickness alone the SPRATTS were as other people,
aud sent immediately for the nearest medical practitioner (or leech,
as they preferred to call him): their only sickness to speak of had
arisen from once feasting medioevally on an old roast peacock, in
company with the trusty friends, who had also been taken very bad
on that occasion; and they ever afterwards avoided that dish, but at
their banquets would have the peacock's head and what was left
of its tail tacked on to some more digestible bird, which, duly
roasted beforehand, and allowed to cool, would thus adorn their
board with borrowed plumes before it was carved and eaten, and so
please their aesthetic sense without making them sick afterwards;
a very wise precaution; for they were very much given to such old-
fashioned hospitality; these SPRATTS: although their acquaintance
was by their own choice (so they said) rather limited; for as staunch
Radicals, they hated the aristocracy, whose very existence they
ignored; shunned the professional class, which they scorned, on
account of its scientific and utilitarian tendency; and loathed the
middle class, from which they had sprung, because it was Philistine;
and although they professed to deeply honour the working man,
they very wisely managed to see as little of him as they possibly
could; and thus, living for each other, and their chosen friends,
they haughtily held aloof from the outer world, which, it must
be owned, betrayed no wish whatever to lure them from their
seclusion.
Although the kind of felicity we have tried to depict may not
commend itself to the taste of the general reader, he cannot fail to
see that for such unworldly people as the SPRATTS, it leaves nothing
to be desired. Youth, health, simplicity of life, a modest competency,
self-respect, friendship, domestic affection, the love of Art, innocence
of mundane ambition, blameless aspirations and regrets, everything
seems combined to make their existence happy and blessed; not to
mention that belief in themselves and each other and all that
belongs to them, which Mr. Punch looks upon as the highest
oonducement (if he may forge a word) to earthly bliss. Indeed, Mr.
Punch does not think small beer of himself, as his readers should
know by this time, and believes Judy to be quite the first among
wives, although he has been used to beat her now and then; and thinks
Toby the finest dog in the world. He has dwelt at length, and with a
lingering fondness, on this idyllic picture of the SPRATTS' home, and
the gentle life they led there. Grave it in your mind, good reader,
for there are few such homes in England; nay, that you may grave
it in your mind the better, Mr. Punch has subtilely limned for you
a cartoon showing the SPRATTS at home, in their pretty garden, with
the twins and the trusty friends, all medievally arrayed, around
them. JACK SPRATT and his wife are playing " cat's cradle," the
twins are revolving quaint conceits in their aesthetic little minds;
the friends are fondly lute-playing, or poring over old myths, and
musing sadly on the light of other days; what time SALLY the
Cook is dishing up a cold roast capon (which, in her haste, »he has
unfortunately peacocked the wrong way), and her distant police-
man looks oter the wall, with one eye for her, and one for the cold
roast capon. Say, reader, is not it a fair< plad, gracious picture?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEI.
ANNUAL FELINE FAMINE.
HE plea for starved cats
has seasonably reappeared
on the prorogation of Par-
liament. There exists an
asylum for destitute dogs,
but the feline race has
hitherto failed to enlist the
feelings of any of those, if
there are any, who in these
days "die and endow a
college or a cat." The cats
are not endowed with any
kind of college, hospital,
or refuge. It has been sug-
gested that to hand over
the starving oats to phy-
siologists for vivisection
would be humane com-
paratively to leaving them
to die in the " slow agonies"
of hunger and thirst; and
the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals
is invoked to undertake
the duty of putting them
out of their misery. But
would not any performer
of that duty have to take
good care how he did it P
Or else, might not one of the Society's own agents very likely
find himself pulled up before a Police-Magistrate on a charge of
"Cruelty to a Cat."
It is sad to think that inhabitants of Belgravia should be so incon-
siderate as to go out of town without leaving some provision for
their cats equivalent to board-wages: and therefore that many cats
are pining in a state of starvation. We may, however, console our-
selves a little by reflecting, firstly, that in a district within which
the cats are mostly starving, all the rats and mice must have been
devoured; and, secondly, that cats dying of hunger in a state of
emaciation, are hardly capable of being utilised by even the most
unprincipled victuallers; so that the more of them we know to be
perishing in that state, the more confidently can we dine at neigh-
bouring restaurants; seeing there is all the less cause to give us
qualms in partaking of made dishes, particularly of jugged hare.

HOW TO MAKE THINGS PLEASANT ABROAD;
Or, the Travelling Smb's Vade Mccum,
ON entering a Railway-Carriage, kick any parcels you may find
in your way, and, if possible, seat yourself upon a bonnet-box.
If Ladies are present, insist upon lighting a short pipe, and close
or open the windows at your own sweet will, and with regard to no
one's comfort but your own.
On board the Steamboat make yourself a nuisance to your fellow-
travellers by indulging in silly practical jokes and smoking bad
tobacco.
On arrival at a Hotel, force your way out of the omnibus before
any one else, and in your selection of a room be as unobliging ts
your fellow-travellers as possible.
Lounge about the hall, smoking your favourite pipe, and stare at
every Lady who enters or leaves the place. If you find a Lady away
from her father; husband, or brother, grin at her.
Bully the Waiters at the table d'hote, and if you can find a kindred
spirit, indulge freely in a conversation of a strongly - seasoned
character.
On your return to the Hotel late at night, shout at the top of vour
voice to your companions, to the great disturbance of those who have
retired to rest before you.
If you are fond of fun, alter all the boots at the doors, and change
the numbers and hours on the "waking-up slate."
If you have to catch an early train in the morning, be careful to
arouse by your noisy conduct all the other inmates of the hotel.
If you enter a Church to "do " it, put your hands in your pockets
and whistle. Push any one praying roughly out of your way,
and if service is being performed, go up to the altar-rails and mock-
ingly inspect it. To avoid unpleasantness, only do this when the
Suisse is away.
Touch everything in the Museums and Picture Galleries, and
declare in broken French, bad German, or imitation Italian (accord-
ing to the country), that the South Kensington treasures beat all the
foreign collections hollow.
In fact behave like a selfish, underbred, ill-conditioned Cad for a
month or six weeks, and then return to England to lose your indi-
viduality in some small City office, or post of a kindred character,
until the time arrives for your annual outing next year, when com-
mence de novo.
ON A MATTER OF TASTE.
As, to judge from the very spirited correspondence that has
appeared on the subject, there seems now to be not a shadow of
doubt but that, in the matter of proper Sunday observance, Great
Britain leads triumphantly in the van ahead of all rivals, Mr.
Punch is, of course, nappy to throw his voice in with the chorus of
universal jubilation. At the same time, since, though no friend to
unnecessary labour, Mr. Punch is by no means opposed to innocent
Sunday recreation, and, therefore, anxious to shed what light he can
upon the better understanding of the subject, he sets aside a corner
of his space for the following little twin documents, which strike
him as perhaps not altogether inappropriate reading for those who
have lately found themselves very much shocked at what goes on
weekly in and about the Paris Exhibition.

A PHILOSOPHICAL EXCURSIONIST.

DISGORGING.
An Allegory on the Hanks of the Nile.
THERE dwelt on the banks of the mystical Nile
An edacious, shrewd, elderly, fat Crocodile;
A pachyderm dandy, or Saurian Swell.
Who wore smart pantaloons cut exceedingly well.
And with pockets capacious—all tokens which tell
Of superior breeding and polish.
He was lord of the land by common consent,
Let it out at high figures, and lived on the rent,
Which he ruthlessly levied and lavishly spent;
And had luck to the tenant who was not content—
He 'd proceed that poor wretch to demolish
In true alligator-like right-divine style.
Well, he grew quite ambitious, this 'cute Crocodile,
A compound, in fact, of King Log and King Stork,
A game which appeared for a season to work.
He led his poor subjects a deuce of a dance,
And taiked them and taxed them right royally.
But your Autocrat ever breaks down in finance,
And this was King Crocodile's piteous chance.
He essayed many dodges his funds to enhance:
He called in the aid
Of experts at the trade,
His accounts in their hands ostentatiously laid,
Took oath to conform to the rules which they made,
And back up their policy loyally.
Yet the devious devices of Saurian guile
Quite baffled these honest experts for awhile;
But such shuffling at last did those gentlemen rile,
And friend pachyderm found that his wriggle and smile
Were met with an ominous frown.
So thinks he, "Like that 'cute Yankee coon, I am treed.
Mere dodge and delay will no longer succeed.
The game's up, so I 'd better come down."
Then he shed many tears, as your Crocodile can,
And " Oh, my poor family !" blubbered the brute.
"But I'll give up the lot, 'tis the honestest plan."
(The "lot was his plunder and loot.)
"Ah! honesty is the best game, after all!"
(He had tried every other, and so ought to know.)
"Restitution's the cry. I respond to the call
With the finest alacrity. Lo!"
Here he turned out each pocket and emptied each bag.
(So a burglar, when chased, will abandon his " swag.")
"Take the dross and divide it!" quoth King Crocodile.
The rejoicings were great. Let us hope it's all right;
But immense are the Saurian resources of sleight,
And it's just on the cards that the game is not quite
At an end on the banks of the Nile.

Friend. Now tell me, Doctor. Wherefore this rise in the Profession of first

Doctors, have they raised their terms for prolonging their patients' lives?
Physician. Oh dear no. At that rate every fee would have to he doubled, or
quadrupled, at least.
Friend. Is it, then, that a first consultation is a so much more scientific
and laborious aft'air than it used to be?
Physician. Partly. But you miss the chief reason for the double fee—yet
how obvious it is!

scale were high enough; because, of course, in case of

Fnend. Not to say that the cures are comparatively
few. And then there are patients who really die of their

Physician. Sometimes.
Friend, But that is generally their own fault?
Physician. Always; and the labourer is worthy of his

I do not note that a delay of seventy minutes in this
retired siding is referred to officially in the Time Table.
Is this not the twenty-seventh time we have been
shunted in the last five hours?
As we seem to be spending the whole afternoon at
this little country station, will you ask the Guard to
direct me to a restaurant, where he can recommend the

dead halt in this spot for the last three hours and a half.

kindly inform me what is the matter with the engine?
If it is quite determined that we are to make a night

(An Epic Fragment.)

STOUT MALCOLM to MAC CULLTJM MOHB
(A mighty chief ne'er braved before)
In haughty accents cried:
"CAMPBELL, look out! I front thee here,
E'en in thy place of pride.
Nay, never feign thy nose to cock,
And crest-like toss thy tawny shock!
I tell thee thou 'rt defied!
I 'm game to struggle for the seat,
And if men say I funk defeat,

On the Duke's cheek the flush of rage
O'ercame the calm that suits the sage
Who wrote The Reign of Law;"
Who in Good Words' more pious page,
And on St. Stephen's wordy stage
Can hold his own at jaw.
"AND DAHEBT THOU THEN
To BEARD THE LlON IN HIS DEN?"
Fierce he broke forth: "And dar'st thou then
To beard the Lion in his den.

Upon my soul it's like thy cheek,
I nave a mind thy nose to tweak,
I won't, though—not at all.

The CALLEIN Oo was young and slim,
POLTALLOCH* tall and stark and grim;
It seemed his mighty length of limb
The stripling must defeat.
Yet was young COLIN toughly strung,
Nimble of foot as swift of tongue,
His giant foe he foiled and flung,
And saved the threatened seat.

Brave MALCOLM turned, well was his need,
Yet shook his fist, and cried,
"A lick—but a close shave indeed!

But not alone by me.

It would be as well if ingenious young dramatic
critics fresh to their work, and burning with the
ardent desire of slaughter, were to restrain their
ardour awhile for the purpose of obtaining some
correct information on the subject they've un-
dertaken to criticise. For example, the dramatic
critic of the Daily News, in reviewing Jeatnes
at the Gaiety, savs, in an airy manner, ""With
the incidents m the ' Yellowplush Papers' proba-
bly no one is unacquainted -^except, as will be
seen, the critic himself—" but it would be difficult
to recognise them in the exaggerated version
here presented." The recognition would be more
than difficult—it would be impossible—Jeamet
having no more to do with the "Yellowplush
Papers" than with Vanity Fair, Pendenms, or
The Virginians. The play of Jeames is
from The Diary of Jeames de la Pluche, which
first .appeared in Punch, with THACKERAY'S own
grotesque illustrations. The Diary is included
under the head of THACKEEAY'S "Burlesques,"
while the Memoirs of Mr. C. J. Yeliowplush—
there are no "Yellowplush Papers," although
the Daily News critic quotes the title in inverted
commas—are bound up with the Paris Sketch-
Book; and, except that they are supposed to have
been written by an uneducated footman, they have
nothing in common with Jeames's Diary. The
story told by Mr. Yellowplush concerns the Hon.
Mr. Deuceact, Lord Crabs, Lady Griffin, and her
poor crooked daughter. Jeames's Diary is mainly
caricature, but there is a good honest purpose
throughout it, and in the characters of Mary
Anne, Granny, and Uncle Sill, THACKERAY has
given us that touch of nature which enlists our
best and truest sympathies. But in the Memoirs
of Mr. C. J. Yellowplush, all, except the dupes,
are yillanously bad. There is not a redeeming
quality among the whole dramatis persona:, who
are, I venture to say, impossible on the Stage.
Their reality would be too hideous. Yet it was
with this work of THACKERAY'S, and not with
Jeames's Diary—from which Jeames was pro-
fessedly taken—that the observant and well-in-
formed critic compared the story of Jeames at the
Gaiety. His Editor will, I hope, reward his young
man's ingenuity with a well-bound copy of all
THACKERAY'S works, and, at the end of the half-
year, make him pass an examination in Jeames's
Diary and The Memoirs of Mr. C. J. Yfllow-
plush.

FROM a speech delivered by Professor HACKEL of Jena, at a

Professor HACKEL. According to a telegram whence extracts
follow—
"In his speech as reported in the Tempt, he expressed gratification at the
progress of evolutionist ideas among French men of science, and remarked
that professors and preachers who ridiculed man's descent from the ape un-
wittingly furnished the best proof of it, their pride and childish vanity being
foibles which might have been bequeathed by the ape."
The best proof of man's descent from the ape being, by Professor
HACKEL'S own showing, far short of demonstration, he, Professor
HACKEL, nevertheless believes it, and that firmly enough to be
capable of accusing scoffers at it of childish vanity and pride. What
is the difference between such science as that and the faith of any
the most dogmatic clergyman?
"Man, however, did not descend from any known anthropoid, but was a
branch of catarhine monkeys of the Old World."
How does Professor HACKEL know that? From scientific proof, or
scientific inspiration?
"The continuity of nature was daily becoming more evident, and super-
stition, mysticism, and teleology would give way to reason, causality, and
mechanism."
Is Professor HACKEL also among the Prophets?
"Among philosophical minds, at least, the believers in final causes of the
universe, immutability of species, sterility of (hybrids f), geological cataclysms,
successive creations, and the late appearance of man were dying out. The
primitive life-organisms were formed chemically by spontaneous generation
at the bottom of the sta like saline crystals in water. Nohow else could the
origin of life be explained. LAMAKCK and DARWIN had struck the last
Dlow at the doctrine of final causes, and modern morphology was irreconcil-
able not only with the dogma of the Creation, but with that of Providence or
the vague idealistic pantheism of HEOEL, SCHOPENHAUER, and HARTMAXN."
In spite of the well-known experiments of Professor TYNDALL.
tending, as far as they go, to disprove "spontaneous generation,'
Professor HACKEL tirmly believes in it—as firmly, perhaps, as the
Archbishop of CANTERBURY does in the dogmas of Creation and of
Providence, notwithstanding modern "morphology."
'The transformation of living organisms under the influence of adaptation)
hereditary selection, and struggle for existence, could not. indeed, b« mathe-
matically demonstrated, but its existence could not be doubted any more than
psychology or social science."
Well: but are there not diversities of opinion concerning social
science'( and as to psvchology, are not its questions as vexed as those
of theology? Nevertheless, Professor HACKEL is as sure about social
science and psychology, together with evolution, development, and
all the rest of it, Darwinism to wit, as M. VEUILLOT is of the cer-
tainty of all the propositions of the late POPE'S Syllabus. The
articles of our Professor's scientific creed cannot, certainly, be
"mathematically demonstrated;" no, but, as M. VEUILLOT might
say, "prcettat fides supplementum ;" and fides and scientia—Pro-
fessor HACKEL'S scientia—do seem very much indeed like one another,
especially scientia.

THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JACK SPRATTS.
A Tale nf Modern Art and Fashion.

PAST II.
iT'happened'.one'day that JACK SPEATT'S beautiful lay figure had
to go back to its maker's, in order to be cleaned, mended, and re- |
stuffed; and the happy thought occurred to JACK SPRATT that he
mijfht as well take a respite from serious Art-work and paint a por-
trait of his wife, as she sat there darning one of his socks and reading
aloud from a black-letter edition of Jack and the Sean Stalk, whose
adventures never seemed to pall on the SPRATTS and their friends.
Now Mrs. SPEATT'S form and features had not been cast in an
early Italian mould; her maiden name was Maloney, and her papa
had kept a leading oil and Italian warehouse in Fmsbury; which
was, indeed, the only Italian feature in the family. Her mother
had been a lovely Lancashire lass; and Mrs. SFRATT nad raven hair,
violet eyes, ruby lips, an ivory brow, and a skin made of the whitest
lily and the reddest rose. Her little head was poised on a long thick
creamy neck, while her tall supple figure erred if at all on the side
of a too superabundant exuberance; but her waist was verv small, i
and so were her proudly arched feet; and her dimpled little white i
hands had not been made for sock-darning, or any such house'
drudgery; but to be tightly-gloved in all that Paris can furnish of
the best in perfumed kid, five and three-quarters, gris perle.
It is, perhaps, too much to say that JACK SPRATT did the same
justice to all these charms as he had always done to those of his lay
figure; but he produced something so different from anything he
had ever produced before, that the trusty friends, who were scanda-
lised beyond measure, repeatedly exclaimed that if that were Art,
then the Old Masters must be icrong!
JACK SPHATT, however, in spite of the trusty friends, had it
framed, called it " Ye Phayre Sockque-darrenere," and forwarded
it to the Royal Academy, much as he scorned that institution; and
the Royal Academicians, who had persistently rejected, year after
year, the pictures JACK SPEATT andTiis friends had as persistently
sent there, accepted this one; and owing, perhaps to a little differ-
ence among themselves about one of their own works, hung it on the
line, in a place of honour in the large room, No. 3, where it made
such a sensation that a plucky Baronet bought it at the private
view.
Thus JACK woke up one morning, and found himself famous.
Of the"Art critics, some proclaimed in him the advent of the long-
yearned-for nineteenth century genius, whose holy mission it .was to
redeem the Art of ourjday from the loathsome degradation into which
it had fallen; and with the generous intolerance of youth, branded
as snobs and ruffians those who could not quite agree with them:
others with the calm benignity of age, pronouncett both JACK and
his admirers to be perfectly harmless, but incurably imbecile; so
that old friends quarrelled, and united families fell out, and all the
world was set by the ears through JACK SPEATT'S little sock-darner;
dealers came down on his studio like the wolf on the fold; and so
great was the crowd round this picture, that the Royal Academy
stationed a couple of mounted Policemen near it, a thing which had
never been done in Burlington House before; and many a shilling
they brought to the Royal Academy—those two mounted Policemen;
and a very happy thought it was to have them there!
The upshot of all this was, that the plucky Baronet, who had
n:hased the little sock-darner, called at JACK'S studio with his
y, and they were much charmed with all they saw. This
Baronet could not only tell a pretty picture when he was told, but
also a pretty face when he saw one. Most Baronets are equal to
that; and as for my Lady, a good-natured and impulsive person,
she was quite beside herself .with delight at the notion of Genius
painting ;Beauty, while Beauty darned the socks of Genius. She
immediately looked upon Mr. and Mrs. JACK SPEATT as a pet little
invention of her own; and before she had been five minutes in their
company, invited them to a " small and early " at her mansion, in
Belgrave Square. By this time also the SPRATTS' life-long prejudice
against the aristocracy had quite evaporated; and they accepted
this invitation with alacrity.
Well, the SPHATTS duly attended that " small and early," attired in
their very best. Mr. Punch forgets what Mrs. SPRATT s very best
consisted of at this particular period of her career; but rather thinks
it must have been a broidered wimple, surcinctured with a golden
liripipe over a welted chaisel-smock of watchet sergedusoy, lined
with shalloon, and edged with vair, or possibly ermine.
JACK SPKATT so far gave way to the conventionalities of modern
life as to wear a gent's evening suit complete for three-seventeen-
six (made to order by a suburban tailor for this special occasion),
and put a smart peacock's feather in his button-hole. At the same

FOUNDED HYAENA-COLOURED BULL-TERRIER, WHO RAN AFTER THE BALL, AND WOULDN'T GIVE IT UP 1
time, in order to show how simple and unworldlv he really was, he
sported a watch-guard made of common pack-thread, and left his
luxuriant locks untouched by the comb.
They got to the '' small and early" an hour and a half too soon, and
had to disport themselves alone in those gilded Belgravian Saloons
until the company had done dinner. Presently the great and gav came
trooping in, and the SPEATTS mingled with the glittering throng,
and liked it very much, especially Mrs. S., who thought it very
civil and attentive; it is not too much to say that she attracted far
more notice than any of the highborn ladies there, even the Papuan
ambassadress.
In the course of the evening, Mrs. SPEATT was prevailed upon by
her amiable hostess (whom nobody had ever been known to resist) to
sit on a stool, as she had done in the famous picture, and darn a
beautiful blue and yellow silk sock of the Baronet's to a running
accompaniment on the pianoforte by one of our rising composers,
who had been cunningly invited on purpose, while SPEATT was made
to stand by in the attitude of an early Italian Master consumed by
a pure but wasting passion.
This impromptu tableau had an immense success, and our simple
friends were the lions of the evening, and passed a delightful time,
and quickly, but firmly, resolved that this outer world they had taken
such pains to shun had its charms, and that they would certainly
cease to shun it in future.
Mrs. SPEATTS' deep-rooted dislike to the female dress of the pre-
sent day did not last much longer than her life-long prejudice
against the aristocracy. The very next morning after that small-
and early, she discarded the medieval garments she had hitherto worn
with such disdain for the eccentricities of modern fashion, and put
herself into the hands of the best dress-maker in town. She had
always looked lovely in her quaint old-fashioned attire, although the
irreverent outside world had been wont to smile thereat as she took
her walks abroad; but oh! how far lovelier she looked in the latest
Pans mode, with chamois-leather underclothing-and tightly cling-
ing skirts that showed her as she really was! The simple-minded
JACK hardly recognised her, and in the depths of his modest mint
made comparisons between his wife and his lay figure, that were
always to the advantage of the latter.
.d he
not
He also bespoke the services of a fashionable "West-End Artist;
no more suburban evening suits for him! but a beautiful dress-coat,
with black velvet collar, and watered-silk facings; a white waist-
coat, with three coral buttons to match the shirt-studs, only bigger;
trousers cut rather wide; neat pumps, and black silk socks, with
white clocks (just such as Mr. Punch wears himself); and for his
button-hole a Stephanotis, in a little glass tube full of water to keep
it fresh.
One invitation leads to another, when the invited are as beautiful
as Mrs. SPRATT, and as clever and modest as her husband, and
especially when they possess such unhackneyed social accomplish-
ments; soon she could scarcely see her lovely face in the Chippendale
mirror over the front parlour mantelpiece, for the eoroneted notes
and cards of invitation she was able to stick there.
It is true that the plucky Baronet's Lady had dropped the
SPRATTS a week after she had taken them up (in favour of a female
^Eolian harpist, with a blind Albino brother, and a very clever and
faithful dog), but during that week she had raved about them so
much, and presented them to so many people, that they were fairly
launched on the sea of London Society, and no longer thought much
of Baronets and their good ladies.
As in duty bound, Mrs. SPEATT was presented at Court. She
also purchased a Peerage, &c., and learnt therein who was connected
with whom, and all about everybody worth knowing; and grew to
talk in sympathetic tones about the dear Marchioness, and poor
Lady ANNA MAEIA, who was such a martyr to rheumatism; and such
like smart people; and you couldn't mention any Lady of decent
fashion before Tier but what she would ask, "Who was she, bv the
bye?" if she didn't know; or if she did, she would insist on telling
you, whether you wanted or not.
Not the least important result of these genealogical studies was
that she established to her own satisfaction that the JOHN SPRATIS
must be descended from the same stock as the St. JOHN D'ESPEBATS,
of Chalkstoneshire, and were consequently entitled to bear the same
crest, which she forthwith had engraved on her notepaper and
envelopes; and 'on suddenly discovering that the head and last re-
maining scion of that ancient but impecunious house had recently cut
his throat in a fit of delirium tremens, after having been publicly

kicked out of the Kingston race-course for welching, she felt the family dis-
grace so keenly that it quite upset her; and although she made JACK SPRATT
wear a hat-hand, and went into slight mourning herself, just for decency's sake,
she would not allow the sad event to be mentioned or discussed in her presence.
As for JACK, he was in the seventh heaven at all this, as well indeed he might
be: not that he thought his wife's beauty had anything to do with their
sudden rise in the social scale; although modest to a fault, ne felt that Society
was only honouring itself in honouring such genius as his, but it pleased and
touched him to see now cordially, for his sake, Society had also welcomed the
one he loved best, and his bosom swelled with manly pride, to see how well she
bore herself and held her own.
How often it happens that the great male Spratts of this world dp not achieve
fame, and thus become ornaments of Society, and worth its notice, till their
females have tarnished their bright scales and hardened their pretty fins in
household cares, and the nursing of innumerable Spratlings (or shall we call
them whitebait.) So that sometimes, the great ones of the earth, and especially
the would-be great ones, and more especially their womankind, and most
especially such of their womankind, as are neither useful nor ornamental, would
gladly welcome the gifted husband, and leave the thrifty wife out in the cold;
and gifted husbands are sometimes so supple-backed, and thrifty wives so meek
and lowly, as to acquiesce in such an arrangement. In which case, Mr. Punch,
who really love* the poor in spirit, and can thoroughly appreciate grovelling
self-abasement in others (if it be only genuine and sincere), hardly knows
which to commend the most, the husband or the wife.
Nor is he at all unsympathetic, when he sees some titled lady-radical, who
rates modest (male) worth higher than Norman blood; or better still, some
fourth-rate woman of fashion, say some rich contractor's wife, or some wealthy
stock-broker's lion-hunting widow, who wishes to make her house attractive;
pressing her hospitality on some small new rickety lion, with a sprouting mane,
say an amateur tenor, while she altogether forgets to invite his maneless but
faithful consort, who can only roar at home; and if said lion, such as he is,
accepts said invitation, and allows his lioness to be passed over and ignored,
even by the greatest lady in the land, it suits Mr. Punch's humour j to get
himself introduced to that lion, and after the usual compliments to hiss into his
ear,
"Doff thy lion's hide,
And hang a livery on those recreant limbs."
And he must be uncommon smart at repartee for an amateur tenor if he can
parry such a home-thrust as that.
Mais, revenons a not By the bye, what is the French for Spratts P
Perhaps there are no such fish or people in that democratic country, so
we will return instead to the trusty friends, who, thank Heaven! are to be
found in all countries. In this country, alas! which is not democratic, trusty
friends who are not asked to dine and dance with the Aristocracy, very seldom
tolerate those who are. They say spiteful things calculated to take one down;
and Mrs. SPRATT did not like to be taken down. It was especially distasteful to
her when she happened quito by accident to mention the dear Marchioness,
and poor Lady A.\,\ v M A uu with her rheumatics, or to bewail Lord GEORGE'S
unhappy misalliance with an attorney's daughter, that these tried and trusty
friends should yawn, or hum, or whistle put of tune, as they would invariably
do on such occasions; moreover, their innocent prattle about the grand Old
Masters (peace to whose ashes!), had begun very much to pall on Mrs. SPRATT;
and she had grown to dislike the cut of the trusty friends' clothes, and the
way they wore their hair, and other mediceval ways they had, so that a coolness
gradually made itself felt between them. At last they fell out altogether, sad
to say, and parted. It happened thus:—
JACK SPRATT and his wife had been driven on a drag to Hurlingham by a
noble lord of their acquaintance. Mrs. SPRATT had sat on the box-seat, and
with the exception of the two grooms (and of her husband, who had been put
inside), there had sat nobody behind her back of humbler rank than the
younger son of an Earl. After a delightful afternoon, they were set down at
their own door. There was to have been a dress evening with the trusty
friends at JACK'S house that night; and one of them, PETER LEONARDO I'i i:,
was to have read a series of original poems, entitled Dank Kisses from
Mildewed Lips. Mrs. SPBATT bade a regretful farewell to all the smart
young men, and on entering her dwelling with a sigh, she found the trusty
friends assembled in the hall. They were austerely pulling off their trousers,
and revealing themselves in brand new mediaeval tights of purple silk, and
short green doublets of a stuff they called " samite. At this sudden sight,
Mrs. SPRATT'S dormant sense of humour was at last aroused, and she poured
forth such peals upon peals of laughter, that these unhappy men were offended
beyond all hopes of reconciliation, and dragging on their everyday reach-me-
downs in great haste, they shook the dust off their feet on the door-step, and
left that hospitable house, never to return there again!
This incident led to the first misunderstanding that had ever occurred
between JACK SPHATT and his wife. He upbraided her with the loss of his
old friends; whereupon she told him that it was no loss at all, and that they
were a " duffing lot"—an expression she must have heard at Hurlingham, or on
the baronial box-seat.
And Mr. and Mrs. JACK SPEATT, who had been so closely united in thought,
feeling, and sympathy, or, rather, who had always been as perfect complements
to each other, each completing the other's being through harmonious dissimilarity
of taste as thoroughly as did their thrice happy namesakes in the undying
nursery rhyme, and like them reaching a common goal by apparently divergent
ways, were no longer one and indivisible evermore.

There I gave him rum-and-water,
Whiskey, and likewise a gin-sling;
Then he took some bottled porter;
Also Brandy-punch galore.
Still that Seaman, old and wrinkled,
Did not yet begin his story.
Only in his eve there twinkled
Something of the treat in store;
For his eye grew moist and glistening—
Glistening at the treat in store.
Sudden, rose he, grim and steady;
Stood a moment, glaring at me;
Then, in husky accents, said he,
"Shipmet 1 "—this, and nothing
more.

How the
Story was
baulked.
Sudden, slipped he 'neath the table—
Slipped and rolled with graceful motion,
Till ne 'd reached his length of cable,
Till he 'd reached the Tavern floor.
Great was my surprise to see him
Stretched so neatly on the floor.;

The Scribe
explaineth,
andmnketh
an apology.
Thus I left that Seaman hoary—
Thus I lost his wondrous story;
For I think he had a story,
Such as man ne'er heard before.
Ought I to have waited longer'?
Ought I to have primed him farther?
P'rhaps my patience had been stronger
Had he not begun to snore-^
I would cheerfully have waited,
But I could not stand his snore!
OUR SAVIOURS.
(A Little Drama of the Day.)
SCENE I.
Britannia (to Reserve Man). I am glad to see, my
fine fellow, that you have responded to your Country s
call with such noble alacrity.
Reserve Man. Well, Ma'am, duty's duty, you know.
Britannia. Exactly! A truly English sentiment,
which does you infinite honour. Go forth, my friend,
with the inspiring consciousness that the eyes of your
countrymen are upon you!
Reserve Man. Well, Ma'am, I dare say it's all right.
I 'm rather fidgety about my wife and children, though.
Perhaps the eyes of my countrymen wouldn't mind
giving a bit of a look to them while they are about it.
Britannia. Never fear, my friend, never fear! A
Conservative Government is now in power; Imperial
spirit, proud patriotism, and true liberality have taken
the place of pettifogging parochialism and cheese-paring.
Reserve Man. Thank'ye, Ma'am; that sounds well.
Quite a pleasure to serve such a Country and such a
Cabinet! [Exit, re-assured.
Chorus of Jubilant Jingoes. Splendid spectacle! Noble
devotion! British pluck and simple dutifulness once
more magnificently illustrated! Capital move this of

that! Bogus tales. Sir, nothing more; last card nlayed
by those precious Radicals. Let us drink to their dis-
comfiture, and the health of our patriotic Government!

SCENE III.
Britannia (to disbanded Reserve Man) . "Well, my good man, what do you want?
Reserve Man. Pretty nearly everything, I 'm sorry to say, Ma'am.
Britannia. Pray be more explicit.
Reserve Man. Well, then, bread for my family, and work for myself.
Britannia. How is it you are out of work'?
Reserve Man. I left my employment at the call of my Country, to help
frighten the Russians from Constantinople. I wasn't wanted, after all, except
for show. You assured me that the eyes of my Countrymen were upon me;
they seem now to be in quite another quarter.
Britannia. Well, but are not your old employers sufficiently patriotic to
take you back again?
Reserve Man. I was in Government employ, you see. They tell me that as
I left at my own wish— that 's their pleasant way of putting it, Ma'am !— 1

Government, to think of me. or subscribe to the Reserve Relief Society.

there 's the Workhouse, you know.

or something turns up.
Reserve Man. Still, it doesn't seem exactly the place for a man who has
served his country, as a soldier, for tive-and-twenty years, and helped tho
Government to bring home "Peace with Honour."

for the present. I want to run down into Lancashire.to hear my Tuneful Three
in their popular symphony on the pleasant theme of " Peace and plump Pockets."

All bosh! Don't believe a word of it. Exceptional case anyhow, and even a
patriotic Government can't be expected to provide for exceptional cases. Put
up to it by those precious Radicals, I shouldn't wonder. Awful sponges,
these low fellows! Only did his duty, after all; and a patriot should be too
proud to beg. What !— Russia up to her games in Affghanistan, eh? Told you

SUNDAY OPENING AT MANCHESTER.
Ajf example to most, if not all, Town Councils and Corporations in the
United Kingdom (particularly in Scotland) has been set by the municipal body
named in the subjoined quotation from a newspaper:—
"SUNDAY OPENING OF FREE LIBRARIES.—The Manchester City Council hare in-
structed their Free Libraries' Committee to make arrangements for the opening of the
reference and branch libraries of that city on Sunday afternoons. The resolution waa
carried by 28 to 20."
Such appears to be the proportion in the Manchester City Council of the wise
Councillors to those who are otherwise. Notwithstanding that the former exceed
the latter in the above ratio, there is still a considerable minority in favour of
refusing to allow working classes on Sunday a place of resort for moral and in-
tellectual entertainment to repair to as well as the public-house. But the in-
terests of Society have triumphed over the stupidity of Sabbatarianism; and now
that the public libraries, as well as the public-houses, are to be open on Sundays
at Manchester, and the workpeople can slake their mental as well as their bodily
thirst, it may be hoped that a decline will soon be visible in the statistics of
drunkenness.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.


or£.vr Garden Prome-
nade Concerts—C
Minor—Netes from
Switzerland.
A STUPENDOUS
Musical Amateur in-
sisted upon my going
•with him to hear "C
Minor," and to make
a note of it. We ended by making a night of itt but that mustn't
be laid to the score of " C Minor," and, in fact, is neither here nor
there. "Well, we dined, wisely and well, nnd then went to the
"C Minor." .We entered our box at Covent Garden amid sup-
pressed cheers from the crowd, and, after scattering largesse to
the officials (a silver fourpenny to the venerable box-keeper, who
mistook it for sixpence, and wept with gratitude), we bowed to the
house, then to Mr. ARTHUB SULLIVAN, and seated ourselves.
Miss ROSE HEHSEE had just finished singing, aa my Stupendous
Friend explained to me, "Her-see Minor." This was his fun,
and I begged him not to repeat it. He did, however, several times,
having, as I subsequently discovered, only two jokes for the evening,
the one leading up to the" other. The other came after he had given
me the first several times. I had just begged him not to harp on
this one string, when he replied, with a diabolical chuckle, that this
was the part of the concert for which he was engaged, i.e., "to harp
on one string."
After this I sat gloomy and discontented, thinking how poverty
makes strange boxfellows—for it was his box. not mine, and I was
in his power,—when M. PAUL VIARDOT struck up Scenes de Ballet
on his violin. I should have enjoyed this hugely, but for the
accompaniment of soda-water corks in the distance, which I venture
ought
to the Monday " Pops." Why can't there be a few drinking bars'
rest during a solo P
'Twae very hard, oh,
On Monsieur VIARDOT!
but the eminent Conductor, who so ably half fills the chair at the
Promenade Concerts, doesn't seem to mind it, so why should nous
autres?
My stupendous and accomplished musical Friend explained every-
thing to me, scientifically. M. VIARDOT having retired gracefully
after being recalled enthusiastically, the orchestra played the Gavotte
from Mignon. It only lasted a few minutes, and roused the audi-
ence to enthusiasm. It was vociferously redemanded. My accom-
plished Friend applauded until his gloves split, and his spectacles
dropped into the promenade below (which gave him another oppor-
tunity of reproducing his joke about " C minor"—it was something
about being able to " see minor" without them), but Mr. ARTHUH
SULLTVAN would not "yield. There he sat with his back to the excited
crowd, stern, passive, impassible. He calmly looked at his watch, as
though in his capacity of M.D.—Musical Doctor—he were feeling the
pulse of the audience. "You don't have this Gavotte again! he
seemed to say. Even the band looked up to him with pale, imploring
faces, but he wouldn't give it again, or, as my irrepressible friend
said, he wouldn't" gai-e-votte again." The turmoil gradually ceased.
The soft-hearted band sighed, but "the Governor was resolved,"
and up came Miss. ANTOINETTE STERLING to sing us " False Friend,
wilt tttoH smile or tceepf" by J. W. DAVISON. Courteously the
Conductor rose, and placing himself at the piano with an affable
gentleman by his side, to turn over a new leaf for him, he accompa-
nied the song, which went admirably. During this, the soda-water-
cork accompaniment was conspicuous by its absence.
"Now," cried my Friend, "for 'C Minor'!
There was the Allegro con brio—then the Andante con moto—then
the Scherzo allegro, running into (without any accident, thank good-
ness) the Allegro.
The gay and careless promenaders stopped to listen to the magic of
BEETHOVEN, and the waiters and the barmaids were struck motion-
less during the con moto. You could have heard a remark drop, had
any one dared to let one fall. No, we all listened in rapt attention,
my Stupendous and accomplished Friend humming the tit-bits sotto
race, and materially assisting Mr. SULLIVAN by beatine time with his
right hand over the ledge of the box. As the Allegro finished,
my Stupendous Friend rose from his seat, and, frowning upon me
as though challenging, or defying contradiction, addressed me thus,
"The Allegro," he said, firmly and authoritatively, "is the point
where Human Genius has reached its uttermost limits,"—and with
this he strode grandly from the box, in so ethereally transcendental
a manner that, had any one met me immediately afterwards, and
told me "Your friend has gone straight up through the roof into
the sky above, all among the angels," I should not have been sur-
prised: indeed, I should rather have expected it.
In meditative humour I descended and joined the giddy throng.
Somehow I wandered towards the GATTI bars, where music hath
charms to soothe the thirsty beast, and I was awoke from my reverie
by these words from a Johnsonian voice, addressing apparently a
select circle, "The Allegro is the point where Human Genius has
reached its uttermost limits. Waiter, another B. and S., well iced."
He was all there,—and I joined him.
On one of the " Classical" nights Mr. SULLIVAN proposes doing
the Opera of HORATIUS FLACCUS, a symphony from CICERO'S charm-
ing composition De Senectute, and the celebrated chorus of Polu-
phoisboio Thalasses from HOMER PASHA'S Iliad. Solo, with Variorum
Notes, by Mons. VIARDOT. Everyone in classical dress. Umbrellas
and sandals left at the door.
Mrs. BANCROFT gave a reading from one of DICKENS'S works, for
some charitable purpose, I believe, at some pleasant spot in Switzer-
land. In return, her enthusiastic admirers there have promised her
a seat—not in the house, but out of the house—a country-seat, on
which her name is to be painted in large letters. Will "Prince
of Wales's, every Night" oe on it? Or, as a really characteristic
memorial of the talented Manageress, why should not that touching
appeal to the public be painted on the back of the seat in letters of
gold, showing now Mrs. BANCROFT earnestly requests the audience
to be in their seats by eight o'clock punctually, not so much that
they may have the full value of their money, but that they may
not lose one word of the charming play (whatever it may be) at her
theatre. Madam, I drink to your success, and as many of them in
the future as you 've had in the past, when ALFRED AUSTIN could
write, in a note to The Season, a Satire.—" Miss MARIE WILTON is
every way charming, and can act only in those parts which arc
written for her; and it is no fault—but rather talent—of hers, that
she creates a more lively sensation when she is not speaking than
when she is."
If ALFRED AUSTIN was right then, how utterly wrong he is now!
Think of the "Robertsonian Comedies"! Polly JScc/cs in Caste,
for example. Of course, SARDOU'S Countess Zicka was out of
Mrs. BANCROFT'S line, but it was a marvellous clever mistake for
all that, and it wasn't everybody who discovered it as soon as did
the artiste herself, who deserves a rest, and as they 've offered it in
Switzerland, I hope it will be accepted. Something resembling local
colour might have been given to the entertainment by Mrs. BAN-
CROFT reading a scene or two from The Maid and the Magpie, in
which Miss MARIE WILTON'S Pippo was inimitable. In her first
song, almost prophetic, Pippo declares—
"I was born to bo what Actors term ' a leading man,'
Tiddle de oodle um:
Or, in common parlance, a tragedi-ffn.
As Hamlet of Denmark to philouophise.
Or, as gallant tar William, to shout' My dear eyes!'
Tiddle de oodle um."
Imagine Countess Zicka, in SAHDOTJ'S last Act; when, having been
"foiled"—the usual tin-foiled of the stage villain—she is being
crushed by Mr. CLAYTON, representative of "all the virtues" —

imagine, I say, Countess Zicka, when recalling the memories of her
past career, so as to touch the callous hearts, suddenly coming upon
that particular reminiscence of "Tiddle de oodle am"!
Uncle Tom's Cabin won't do in its present form. Why '' our boys"
in the Gallery can do a better break-down than these Niggers; and
then we have all seen the imitation, which is so much better than
the real thing. Little Eva (most intelligently played by Miss
CARRIE COOTE) is a horrid prig of a child, and l-nc/e Tom a canting
old nuisance, enough to irritate any master. Mr. CHAKLES WARNER
as George Harris, has a deal of shouting and stamping to go
through; and the bravest thing he does, in his character of hero and
defender of the innocent and afflicted, is to stand on a platform, and
fire a revolver, shooting the Comic Man six times through the
umbrella. This brings down the Comic Man and the curtain^with
a roar from the audience; but it is not much for a hero to do,
after all—not, I mean, exactly an act on which he would like,
subsequently, to rest his reputation as a hero.
Messrs. JABRETT and PALMER, however, are first-rate Showmen,
best after BARXIOT, bar none; and they 're safe to make it pay:
but they 've got their work cut out for them here, says

a fertile cause of railway acci-
dents. The points which we

A point of starting trains so
quickly on the heels—or wheels—
of one another, that the pointsmen
grow confused, and can scarce
toll which is which, and the
Signalmen get tired, and make
confusion worse confounded.
A point of neglecting- to provide
continuous brakes, and thus con-
tinuously exposing the heads and
limbs of passengers to the risk of
breakage.
A point of penny-wise economy
in the manning of small Stations
with a brace or so of boys, who,
though they labour manfully, are
utterly incompetent to do the
work required of them.
A point of cutting Cheap Fast
Trains in two, and sending off
one-half without sending off due
notice all along the line that the
other half is following.
A point of shunting heavy
goodsr waggons in the greatest
haste, and when there is the
greatest chance of some train
running into them.
A point of perilous pound-fool-
ishness in keeping Signalmen at
their posts, until worn-out, they
fall asleep, and mistake them for
their bed-posts.
A point of crowding twenty
people into a compartment, so
that they cannot make their exit
safely in the scanty time allowed
them at bye-stations.
A point of working Engine
Drivers so long at a stretch, that
they well nigh ere the end of it
are driven from their senses.

LIFE IN HIM YET.
As there appears to exist considerable divergence of opinion as to
the simplest method of speedily and effectually "re-organising" his
rather impossible friend, the Turk, Mr. Punch, who has received
many interesting but conflicting suggestions on the subject, takes a
random handful, and pins them up before him. The general outlook
being promising, Mr. Punch subjoins a few as under, to wit:—
Let the SULTAN—say, on and after the fifth of November next—
with a view to the reduction of all superfluous expenditure,
(1) Never take part in any State ceremonial that involves the
use of accessories other than a plain kitchen chair, two
broomsticks, a couple of boys, a few decorations in coloured
ribbon, and a newspaper cocked hat, and—on such occasions
as the Opening of Parliament or the marriage of some
member of the Royal house—perhaps a dark lantern, a
bundle of matches, and a pair of gilt pantomime spectacles;
(2) Have his Civil List cut down to eighty pounds per annum,
payable quarterly, accept Rosherville as a winter residence,
and appear on three five shilling Saturdays, during the
height of the season, at the Crystal Palace;
(3) Make up any deficiency in his" income, as thus secured, by
giving private lessons in etiquette to intending British
Oriental Residents.
Let a spirited Joint Stock Company take over the whole of Con-
stantinople as it stands, and open it, not later than the 1st of May
next, as an International Aquarium, and Five o'clock Tea Gardens,
at which fully paid-up Fellows shall have the privilege—
(1) Of introducing two friends to the reserved seats;
(2) Of being eligible to any posts of emolument that happen to
fall vacant in Eastern Roumelia;
(3) Of ordering hot dinners on the premises before two P.M. ; and
(4) Of taking the rank and title of Turkish Pashas in England
and the Channel Islands.
Let reform commence in the whole of Asia Minor simultaneously,
by the immediate introduction into all towns, numbering a popula-
tion of 5,000 souls, of—
(1) A circulating library;
(2) A Policeman;
(3) A music-hall; and
(4) A public-house; the number of the latter to be determined
by the wants of the locality, estimated by the reasonable
ratio of one to every 215 inhabitants.
Let capital flow freely to the East, and, hand in hand with enter-
prise, arrange a complete net-work of railways that shall bring the
Caspian as close as Cowes and render the Euphrates as popular for
water-parties as the Thames; the whole scheme being helped on by
the opening of a cricket-ground at Bagdad, and the establishment of
a branch of the liamsgate Marina at the head of the Persian Gulf;
And lastly, let any financial deficiencies, should such arise from a
vigorous prosecution of the above programme, be instantly made up
from the teeming gold, silver, copper, diamona, and other mines that
are only waiting the arrival of the requisite Government plant to be
worked at this moment triumphantly in Cyprus.
Mr. Punch can only add that if a careful perusal of the above does
not make the Turk and his friends happy and hopeful—nothing will.

HARD WORK IN THE WORKHOUSE.
OUR friend, Mr. BUMBLE, has been greatly scandalised by the perusal, in
a daily paper, of "A Magistrate's Experience of Stone-breaking," as related
by his Worship himself, Mr. ALBERT SIMPSON, of Elmhurst, near Garstang, in a
letter to the Garstang Board of Guardians. Mr. SIMPSON had occasionally had,
as a duty, to send vagrants to prison for refusing to complete their task of
stone-breaking in the vagrant cells at the Garstang Workhouse; but, as many
of them declared they were unable, he, feeling now and then not quite satisfied
that justice was done them, determined to "put the matter to the test by
breaking a ' task' of stones" himself—a proceeding which Mr. BUMBLE deplores
as " werry doggeratory and in for a dig.'*
Having, however, formed the resolution to do what seems so derogatory
to our Beadle, Mr. SIMPSON heroically did it, as he thus describes:—
"Accordingly I went into a cell, and, without asking any instructions, proceeded to
break the stones. I found fully three-fourths of the stones such as any man in moderate
health, and unskilled in stone-breaking, could manage, but the remainder were quite
beyond the power of an unpractised hand. It took me over five hours of incessant labour
to complete the lot, of which time nearly one-half was consumed in breaking six stones,
which defied for a long time my utmost strength, although I am not unskilled in the use of
the hammer. The fact was, that I did not understand the grain of particular stones,
which a practised hand would have split easily: and I have no doubt that, through igno-
rance of the work, I exercised sufficient strength to have broken four times the quantity I
did. I completed the task thoroughly exhausted, and with my hands raw and in many
places bleeding'."
"For a Swell to demean his self like that," says Mr. BUMBLE, "may be
all werry -well for a Immature Casual a-goin to write a article about it in a
newspaper, 'cause bisnis is bisnis; but a Magistrate got no bisnis to hinterfere
with the arraignments of Workus interiors, and witch I consider a most improper
wiolation of porochial economy."
Mr. BUMBLE deprecates any attention on the part of "porochial" authorities
to any such " speeehious " ^presentations as these :—
'Of course my object was to do the work exactly as a casual
tramp would do who had never done it before, and I know now
where I wasted my labour; but I can assure you I can quite
understand why a weakly man, ignorant of stone-breaking, pre-
fers to go to gaol rathe'r than to complete such a task. Now,
the result of the present svstem is that the casual vagrant who
is really in search of work has inflicted upon him what not only
amounts to positive punishment, but also more or less incapaci-
tates him for work; whilst the habitual vagrant gets through
his task without difficulty, and the better man of the two gets
placed in the worst position, which is contrary to all justice."
"No sitch a thing," insists Mr. BUMBLE. ''None on
'em better, and none wus than another, all alike, not a
pin to choose between none on '*pa, all tramps and
wagrants and wagabones, the 'ole bilin, all ekally poor,
and all to be put together under the 'ed of wicious
pawpers."
Mr. SIMPSON proceeds to suggest :—
"1. That a copy of instructions on stone-breaking be hung in
each cell, to be road to those vagrants who cannot read it for
themselves. 2. That either the extra hard stones are kept
out of the 'task' allotted to the casual vagrants, or that they
have the option of some other labour, such as oakum picking,
which must be made equally remunerative to the ratepayers."
The expense of furnishing "these despicable wag-
rants" with a copy of instructions on stone-breaking
in each of their cells, is strongly objected to by Mr.
BUMBLE. "Let 'em find it out," he says, "as they was
meant to, and don't put the beggars to no other labour
but what the ratepayers is sure to find remunerative a
good deal more than ekally." Tiewing pauper task-work
as simply a ratepayer's question, Mr. liuMBLE, "with all
due difference to a "VVurshipful Justis of the Peece,"
considers the concluding observation of Mr. SIMPSON'S
letter the only sensible saying it contains:—
"It must bo borne in mind that every one of these unfortunate
men sent to prison eutjiils considerable extra expense on the
ratepayers."
"Yes," assents Mr. BUMBLE, "the expense of the rate-
payers; that's the pint. Don't send the willanous
wagrants to jale by no means'. Compell 'em to break
stones, weather they can without urtin theirselves or no.
Let a able-bodied inmate stand over every one on 'em as
refuses with a good 'osswhip. Stone-breaking is the pro-
perest tax wot is or can be for them abandond outcursts.
They asks for bread, and they receives stones as well;
and'if that isn't gorspel, I don't know who is."
Nevertheless, may there not be a degree of doubt in
some minds, if oakum-picking, considered as task-work,
is not hard labour, almost, if not quite, sufficiently
severe for the punishment of merely casual vagrancy, to
which the vagrant, honest and industrious, has been
reduced by altogether unmerited misfortune, like, for
example, a discharged Reserve Man out of employ?

DEAB CHARLIE,
I send ve the photers you arsked me to git, in your last.
They 're a nice little lot, and no error ; the pink of the swell and the

Which the two nowadays is so mixed, it's no use to try drorin' the
line.
There it parties as don't like the "blend," but their humbuggin'
notions ain't mine.
I am nuts on nice gals, as you know; pooty faces, and figgers, and
that,
Are things as I tumble to quick; I 'm a 'ot 'un, mate, all round my 'at.
And I hold that this photygraff fakement is proper; it gives yer a
peep
At a lot as you couldn't be fly to no otherways—not on the cheap.
That 's it, don't yer know! Done on canvas these prime 'uns 'ml

But now, for a bob, you caa twig 'em familiar like, doing a smile,
Or tipping the wink confidential, as if you wos one of their lot,
And tigged out in wot they calls dishabille, took, I should say, when
it's 'ot.
The tip-tops are losing their stiffness; the grand highty-tighty

Which is wot, as I 've mentioned afore, is the 'opef ullest mark of

I 'm a bit of a bloomin' feelosopher, CHARLIE, my boy, as you know,
And there 's lots to be learned from the text of " One shillin' a-piece,

There 's the QTJEEN — she ain't much to be sure — and there 's BESSIE
BOLAIB of the Cri.:
By Jingo, 'er bust is a buster, and hasn't she jest got an eye?
Then comes Mrs. THREESTABS, of Thingummy, one of the horty

And I 'm blowed if she doesn't run BESSIE a close 'un in Jigger and

"Mixed'pickles," my boy, and no kid. Oh, I 've got a whole pile at

They 'd be flattered to hear the remarks when I 'm trottin' 'em hout
to our men.
To git 'em, jest like tea and srimps at a shillin' a 'ead for the lot,
Is prime; and it's kind of 'em CHARLIE, most kind of 'em, blest if
it 's not.
In course their sole haim's to oblige AIM; they carn't care a cuss for

With the batch as I sends yer per post you '11 be able to cut quite a

And astonish the rurals a few, as they mayn't be quite up to it yet,
With the sight of the town's latest belle iceeze-a-tcee with the

I 'ave heard soapy sneakers protest, and declare the whole thing

But I think they 'ad best stow their sermons ; I do 'ate a sport-spiling

If the Swellesses likes to be looked at in attitoods vum-yum by hus,
There 's no gent with a taste 'ud object, though they hogled a 'un-

Which they can cast sheep's eyes and no error, the profession don't
touch 'em at that,
But a pooty gal, gentle, or simple, as carn't use her glims is a flat.
It 's that and the spicey-cut toggery fetches me CHABLIE, that's poz,
And if you don't say werry much ditto, you ain't arf the 'ot 'un you

"Pootv souls!" When I sits with my halbum, jest like that old

(A nice cup o' tea that, old Miwey !) I feel as we 're on the right lay.

But Society's "lions," at least, wag their tails on the cheap, and

Wot the 'usbands and brothers thinks on it is more than yours truly

But I s'pose one must pocket some pride, if one's game is to smack

It ain't any use to go sticking up "private " on all o' your doors,
'Cos yer see if the public means twigging, aeon posters it jolly soon

You see if you 're able to spot 'er. Meanwhile, I 'm

EQUIVOCAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
AN Irish contemporary prints and publishes a "Want" expressed

scrupulously clean habits, one Furnished Eoom, at £1 per month, bbout
a quarter of an hour from town. — Address, " ECONOMY," office of this paper.
By the disjunctive particle "or" interposed between " Christian"
and " Protestant," it may be surmised that the advertiser means ti
differentiate " Protestant" from " Christian," and express an idei
that Protestants are not Christians. On the contrary, we may take
"or " in the sense of " otherwise," implying the notion that Protest-
ant and Christian are convertible terms, and that Protestants are the
only Christians. "ECONOMY" seems economical in the use of words
in a degree amounting to parsimony.

THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JACK SPRATTS.
A Tale of Modern Art and Fashion.
V' (EJTHET/C YCVU9 C.1i\\.\j

PABT III.
Miw. SPEATT had not only learnt how to dress fashionably,
and to laugh at the peculiarities of old and trusty friends,
and to use vulgar, modern, slang expressions that would
have made the fastidious CHAUCEB turn in his grave; but
she had also learnt how to get rid of that unconsciousness,
which had once been as a sweet frame to her beauty, and
which had so nobly stood the test of those ^little round
mirrors in her husband's studio.
(Have our Lady readers ever.contemplated]themselves in
one of these f)
During the early days of her married life, she had often
sat by her husband in the National Gallerv, reading aloud
to him, as he copied those singularly seductive types of
female loveliness which the early Italian Masters have
made so especially their own; and she had shared in his
enthusiasm for them, and had often blamed herself for being
so utterly unlike.
There had been one picture in particular, the "Martyr-
dom of Citpitl," by LUCA SIGNOKELLI, in which Cnpid him-
self, and the nymphs who persecute him are of a beauty
so overpowering that J. SPBATT and the trusty friends
would always feel faint, and weak in their backs and legs,
through sheer excess of sensuous pleasure when they gazed
at it; and varied as those nymphs were in form, hue, and
feature, she could not claim the remotest resemblance to
any single nymph amongst them, not even when she tried
in a little round mirror.
JACK SPEATT himself, who had fallen in love, courted and
married before he had ever seen an old picture, could not
but also feel at times that his wife was not quite such as
the early Italian Masters would have chosen for a model;
and he had been confirmed in this impression by the careless
remarks of his trusty friends, who had not yet gotten them-
selves wives of their own (and who, although they would
speak of each other's faces as "beautiful," "lovely,"
"divine," and so forth, were extremely fastidious in the
matter of modern female beauty).
This disenchantment had been the one slight drawback to
a happiness nearly perfect; but he had alwavs been too
much of a Gentleman to reproach his wife with her physical
shortcomings; and had found both his consolation and his
reward in her gentleness, her gratitude, her admiration for
his genius, and her complete devotion to himself.
Moreover, although he could not alter her form, features,
and complexion, he had endeavoured to teach her most of
the early Italian attitudes, and she had proved a docile and
intelligent pupil.
But now all this was changed; for wherever she went
she was greeted with an admiration sufficient to turn an older
and wiser head than hers; Dukes, Bishops, Generals, Ad-
mirals, even Right Honourables vied with each other in
paying pretty compliments to the pretty Mrs. SPKATT; so
that she grew somewhat vain, and almost seemed at times
as though she were half inclined to give herself airs; for in-
stance, she would innocently blurt out before the wives and
daughters of these great dignitaries (especially if they hap-
pened to be rather plain) that she would sooner be dead than
not be beautiful, and the wives and daughters did not
always relish these egotistical bursts of confidence.
Then there were the Royal Academicians, who also vied
with each other in spoiling her; the painters painted her,
one and all; and the sculptors sculpted, and the engravers
engraved; while the cantankerous architects looked on with
smothered envy; and gay young Associates, fellows of infi-
nite jest, enlivened the sittings with inimitable song, dance,
and story.
Not content with painting her, one famous artist, pos-
sessed of wide and varied information, and quite an authority
in such matters, solemnly stated that so beautiful a woman as
Mrs. JOHN SPEATT had not been seen for four hundred years!
It requires less than this to make a pretty woman THE
FASHION—which Mrs. SPEATT immediately became.
So that even that lily of lilies, born of tne foam of the sea,
wafted hither from tne Channel Isles by soft propitious
winds, immortalised by MULAIS and POYNTEB, and en-
shrined for ever (along with a good many others) in the con-
stant but capacious heart of Mr. Punch, was fain to abdicate
from her throne in favour of that rose of roses, Mrs. JACK
SPIUTT; and, to her inexpressible relief, was permitted once
more to mingle with the gay and fashionable throng with-
out .attracting more notice than any other handsome and well-

''THE R. H. A."
Mrs. Slioddy (wJut lias rung for licr Cook). "MRS. SIMMER, I SAW AN OFFICER DOING DOWN MY ARE'. Now, I WILL NOT ALLOW
THIS!"
Cook. "LOR', M'UM, YOU CAN'T OBJEC' TO THAT, M'UM. IT 's ONLY MY SON, M'UM—IN THE R'YAL 'Os ARTILLERY, M'UM—JUST
GAZETTED BOMBARDIER HE SAYS, M'UM, AND COME TO SHOW HIS UNIFORM!!"
dressed lady; and as handsome and well-dressed ladies are by no
means the exception in this gifted land, she had a nice easy time of
it; quite a holiday, so to speak.
Not only the Fine Arts, as represented by the Royal Academy,
but poetry, literature, and the exact sciences followed suit, and
Daid homage to the popular Mrs. SPBATT in the persons of their most
tamous representatives—shining lights, whose names are household
words all over the habitable globe; and such homage she would
receive at first with gracious condescension, for she made it her
queenly boast that she honoured true genius irrespective of birth
or breeding; which was very good of her, for in her inmost heart
she thought but lightly of these immortals who had worked so hard
for their immortality.
It must be remembered that Mrs. SPBATT had lived on terms of
daily and familiar intercourse with the greatest geniuses of the age;
for such, as she had always been given to understand, were her
husband and the trusty friends; and this on their own authority;
and these were, of all people, in a position to speak of such matters,
being, as we have already said, critics as wefl as everything else,
and knowing each other well.
There was PETER LEONARDO PYE, for instance, the author of
Dank Kisses from Mildewed Lips, who was quite the greatest poet
that had sung since MILTON, as had been ungrudgingly acknowleged
by JACK SPHATT and the trusty friends, and even admitted by him-
self; though not without reluctance, for he was the very soul of
modesty, was young PYE.
Indeed, so high were his aspirations, that he passionately longed
not to be recognised by the world for many generations to come, and
lived in constant dreadof sudden popularity—thereby standing on afar
higher pinnacle than any of the geniuses Mrs. SPBATT met in Society.
Well, P. L. PYE wore side-spring boots, an sesthetio neck-tie,
and trousers that would have been thought ill-conditioned in the
Hampstead Road.
Burning thoughts, fiery though Platonic passions, and a habit of
too recklessly consuming the midnight oil had wasted his once comely
cheeks, contracted his chest, and made his shoulders round and
doping, and his legs so weak that he stood over like an old cab-
dorse; and proud as Lucifer though he was, and highly educated,
For he had graduated with honours at the London University, he
was only the son of a hatter; with whom he had, however, quarrelled
and parted (which may. perhaps, have accounted for his always
wearing such shocking bad hats); and his thoughts were so lofty
md sorrowful that he kept most of them to himself, and those less
lofty ones he had occasionally imparted to Mrs. SPBATT had still
been too lofty for her to understand, and had made her feel very
uncomfortable.
And though he thought her quite the most beautiful woman he
had ever seen out of an old picture (he never looked at any others,)
his admiration was expressed in such an abstract way, that she
could scarcely apprehend it.
So that she felt not only that PYE'S company gave her no pleasure,
but that to be seen riding, driving, or waltzing with him. even had.
he been capable of such accomplishments, would not have made
her an object of envy in the eyes of other women; and it was the
same with the rest of the trusty friends, who in genius, sorrow, and
shabbiness of outward form quite equalled PYE, if they did not indeed
surpass him.
\Y hence she somewhat hastily concluded, that geniuses were care-
less in dress, eccentric in manner, very much taken up with them-
selves, and connected in some way or other with business; and she
divided Society into two portions, those who were in BUBKE. DE-
BRETT & Co., and those who were out of it, and looked upon all the
latter as though they had been meritorious and more or less gifted
hatters, worthy of all respect, but whose attentions conferred no
social distinction on a pretty woman.
Argal, she much preferred the gorgeous gilded glittering swells,
who had been born to Swelldom, as she had been born to Beauty,
without any fuss or bother.
For Swelldom is like the rose, in that some of its scent will cling
to those who live with it; so, at least, thought Mrs. SPBATT.

[SBPT%B£B 21, 1878.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
And Swelldom is pretty to look at, and wears trousers that never
bag at the knees, and boots and shoes that do not turn up at the toes,
nor flatten under the sole of the foot; and the flowers in its button-
holes are poems, and its hats, neckties, and gloves are always new,
and always the very best of their kind.
Swelldom is friends with horses and dogs, and guns and fishing-
rods, which are easier to master than pictures and poems, and the
intellectual problems of the day, and do not wrinkle the brow, nor
waste the cheek, nor sap the youthful frame; and its easy flow of
talk is generally suited to the capacity of the greatest number,
and its golden silence does not proceed from unpleasantly lofty
speculation.
Nor is there anvthing at all abstract abput that kind of worship
which male Swelldom of whatever age will always render (unless
duly checked) to lovely woman wherever it meets her; especially
when her sole and exclusive claim to its warm regard lies in the
exuberance of her purely physical charms: as was the ease with,
Mrs. JACK SPBATT, who had neither rank, wealth, accomplish-
ments, conversation, nor repartee, and couldn't even say Boh! to
her husband.
No, Gentle Reader, it was not Pallas Athene they worshipped in
Mrs. SPRATT, these gorgeous, gilded, glittering Swells, nor Diana,
the chaste huntress of the silver bow, nor any one of the Nine Muses;
but Venus Aphrodite, the goddess of visible, tangible love, whose
apparent incarnation in Mrs. SPRATT'S beautiful face, smooth white
skin, and ripely-rounded form they openly adored, with an adora-
tion which Mr. Punch will describe as " concrete, in opposition to
that "abstract" kind of adoration indulged in by PETER LEONARDO
PYE, and which Mrs. SPRATT thought so vague, uninteresting, and
slow.
And it speaks worlds for her guilelessness and purity that she
should have accepted this wholesale tribute of concrete masculine
incense as frankly as it was offered^, and been honestly proud of the
same, and looked upon it as conferring social dignity on herself, and
honour and glory on her husband.
A more worldly and suspicious nature would have taken umbrage
at once, and run away with the unhappy idea that homage of this
kind, openly addressed to a wife and a mother, was but an insult in
disguise, involving moral degradation instead of social dignity, and
instead of honour and glory, only ridicule and contempt.
So that it was an unmixed pride and joy to her, wherever she
went, to be surrounded by a crowd of smart male devotees, young
and old, in whose tender tones of voice, and eager eyes observant of
every detail of her face and form, she could near and see unmis-
takeable evidence of a fervour as impassioned as it was direct and
sincere.
But this manly devotion to Mrs. SPRATT was by no means a source
of unmixed pride and joy to the wives and daughters, who, to
mark their disapprobation, not only ridiculed that Lady, and every
peculiarity of her dress, gait, and manner, but actually imitated
these peculiarities in their own persons, wearing their hair, moving
and laughing exactly as Mrs. SPIIATT did; and all this whether
they were young or old, tall or short, dark or fair, lean or fat—and
so did the sisters, and the cousins, and the aunts.
Which gave boundless gratification to Mrs. SPHATT, and tickled
Mr. Punch immensely.
IRISH TOURISTS' QUESTIONS.

A COMMITTEE of the Irish Licensed Victuallers has addressed in-
structions, based on legal opinion, to the trade, respecting the opera-
tion of that paternal enactment the Irish Sunday Closing Act.
Amongst these occurs the subjoined advice :—
"Nobody can be deemed a bmu fide traveller who travels for the mere
purpose of getting liquor, simply because that would be an evading of the
law, and therefore not boniJL fide; but every one who travels three miles on
Sunday upon any lawful occaaion, is a bond Me traveller, and may lawfully
be served with reasonable refreshment, whether of food or drink."
Query.—Firstly, how is 0'BONIFACE —not to say O'Buso —to
ascertain that anyone demanding refreshment as a bond fide tra-
veller has travelled for the mere purpose of getting liquor P The
postulant might say, or even swear, that he had net travelled for
that purpose at all at all, but for some other, and wanted whiskey
only to quench unpremeditated thirst; and these asseverations,
though made by an Irishman, might possibly be inexact.
Secondly, what is meant by " any lawful occasion" upon which it
is necessary a person should have travelled to be recognisable as a
bond flde traveller? Suppose a man—or possibly oven a woman—
takes a three miles walk for the purpose of exercise and the sake of
health, that surely would be a lawful occasion within the meaning
of the Irish Sunday Closing Act, and would constitute not only a
band but an optima fide traveller. Or else, sure, the Irish Sunday
Closing Act is as unconstitutional as it is Irish, and very Irish
indeed. But, in fact, perhaps it is only Irish as construed by a
Committee of Irish publicans.
Down on Him.
"GIRLS have no sense of humour!" EDWIN cried,
if When ANGELINA smiled not at his chaffing.
"You men are so ridiculous," she replied;
"If we had much, we should be always laughing."
A LIMB OF THE LAW.
A PIECE of slang which, once thought extremely sharp, would now
be voted equally slow, was the street-saying of the period. "You 're
a nice man, I don't think!" This expresses a style of man
exemplified, apparently, in the sender to the Law Times of the
notification following:—
LAW PARTNERSHIP.—A Graduate of Oxford, admitted a Solicitor
this year, capable of forming and managing a good litigious connection,
WISHES to meet with a Solicitor who has a respectable Conveyancing busi-
ness, with a view to a PARTNERSHIP.—Apply, &c.
A man capable not only of managing, but also of forming, a good
litigious connection—good, of course, in the limited sense of gainful—
one would imagine to be a most efficient aide-de-camp to the Com-
manding Officer of the Inns of Court Volunteers, and a proportionally
useful and pleasant member of Society.
FULL OF EMPTINESS.
A NEWSPAPER contains a statement that on the Great Northern
Railway there is employed a " vacuum brake " liable to fail without
warning, and requiring to be continually tested to see whether it is
in order. This is precisely the vacuum which Nature abhors. It
appears to be as often as not no vacuum at all in a pneumatic sense,
but a perfect one morally, being entirely void of utility, and, in that
respect, a contrivance so empty that there is nothing in it. Such a
vacuum is of about as much use as that which the Chimrera buzzed
in, devouring his second intentions. A brake like that had better
be called a break-down, as it would be likely to prove in time of
danger; a brake unserviceable for stopping a train and preventing
collision and breakage. The stokers call it a " vaccum, which is
a good enough name for it to distinguish it from a vacuum properly
so called.
Unnecessary Indignation.
MR. PUNCH has received two or three letters from amiable but ex-
cited Correspondents, denouncing violently, on sentimental grounds,
the Cartoon which Mr. Punch published last week, and declaring it
to have given great offence. In certain quarters, perhaps, it has.
Parties deeply interested in the various Collision Companies are not
at all unlikely to be very greatly offended with a work of Art par-
ticularly calculated to admonish excursionists to take very good care
how they travel by land or water.
Injudicial Astrology.
IT is an old saying that "misfortunes never come single," and
certainly terrible accidents, as well as enormous offences, appear to
occur in groups, and at times, like epidemics. Why P Owing,
Astrologers of course say, to the influence of malignant planets. But
if that causes the accidents, why don't they predict them P Can it
be that the malefic influence is atmospheric, and that at certain
seasons there are criminality and carelessness in the air P

Rather hard on the "Harp that once"—but not more than once,

once'd in TABA'S Halls. TARA was probably the proprietor of
several Halls, and the Harper did so many turns all round, one

Second Envoy (intervening and seizing him on the other tide).
Come, don't be so rough with the old gentleman. Catching hold of
him like that! A pretty friend you are! Here, let him go, can't

Both the Envoys (together). Because we are so friendly!
[They let him go suddenly, and beckon off respectively right [and
left.

arranging his collar.) Allah be praised! Allah be praised! A little
repose. I shall go to sleep. [Sits down on the ground.

members of their respective suites bearing presents). Never I
First Envoy. No, never—till you have accepted these tokens of
the condescending friendship of my august master the Great White
Czar. See.: Genuine Caviare; some fully paid-up shares—in a
State line; the grand cross and collar of the exalted order of the
Purple Hytena; and one dozen of dry Vouvray champagne.
[Empties them all on the ground in a heap before him.
Second Envoy (kicking them aside). Nonsense! Call these gifts!
Look at mine! Here is something that speaks not of despotism, but
of progress. Behold! Two tins of corned beef; back numbers of an
Encyclopedia; a public-house sign; and—a double bathing-machine.
(Pushes them all on to him). It is with such materials as these that
the mighty civilised empire I represent
The Ameer (feebly). Yes, yes, I know! But why, 0 my vener-
able little grandfathers, force the poor old Ameer to accept such costly
gifts? In Cabul the blessed, we neither speculate, nor drink, Hor

Both the Envoys (together). Never! (They each seize one of his
arms). Thus do we display our friendship.
[All three again scuffle violently for five minutes.
The Ameer (endeavouring to release himself). An, yes! true, very
true, 0 my importunate little grandfathers! But what if I decline
it. This, your friendship?
First Envoy (breaking away from him with a bound.) Decline it,
you Moslem! Nigger! you can't!
Second Envoy (springing away from him with a leap). Decline it?
Misguided old savage! 'You shan't.'
The Ameer (again wiping his forehead, and arranging his collar.

To checkmate "Russian aggression." a mission of
rather a formidable character is on the point of de-
parture for Afghanistan. Always ready to serve his
country, Mr. Punch begs to present the British Com-
missioner with a few phrases suitable to the occasion,
to be used in an interview with SHERE ALI with the
assistance of an interpreter:—
CONVERSATION WITH A FRIENDLY FOE OE FAITHLESS
FRIEND.
Good morning, Your Highness. I would shake hands
with you could I put down my sword and revolver.
Will you permit me to see to my luggage, which
consists entirely of heavy artillery and ammunition of all
sorts.
I shall have much pleasure in conversing with you
about the weather after I have quartered my escort
(which is made up of an army corps or two) upon the
inhabitants of your capital.
Would it amuse }Tou to see me carry your palace by
storm?
In honour of the renewal of our relations, shall we
have a grand sham fight with real cartridges?
Merely as a little practical joke, how would you like
to be dethroned?
I hope you will consider it capital fun if I find it
necessary just to make a slight change in the reigning
dynasty.
Shall we have a friendly cup of tea together while
we arrange a small treaty, binding you and your de-
scendants hand and foot for two or three thousand
years '<
Can I help you at all in your plans by carrying you
away in chains to Calcutta?
Alter you have been so kind as to send back the
Russian Ambassador in a cage to St. Petersburg, I will
just tread upon your neck as a proof of my good inten-
tions.
Really I must thank you very much for all your
courtesy. Pray accept these books, the British Army
and Navy Lists. You will find them very useful works
of reference. And now 1 will call out my rather
numerous escort, and bid you adieu—perhaps an reroir!
MILTONIC MEDITATION (by a looker-on at lawn-tennis).
-" They also serve who only stand and wait."
GUIDE FOE THE FRENCH IN LONDON.
(Translated from the English in Parii.)
ARRIVAL. — During your journey from Folkestone or Dover to
London, if you see any Englishmen present, talk about England and
its people in the most disparaging terms possible. Utterly ignore
their nationalprejudices, and lay down the law to their utter con-
demnation. When you reach the Railway Station, snub the Custom
House Officers and laugh at the Police. Bluster your way into a
cab, and shout to the driver, in bad English, "Here, you chap, you!
take to me Leicester Squarr—sharp! quick! cut! be oft'!"
At the Hotel.—If possible, select a French one, where they will
give you a bad imitation 01 Parisian cooking. Ask for your own
national periodicals, and if you see a picture of Queen VICTORIA
hanging on the walls, jeer at the English love of Royalty. If Eng-
lishmen happen to be staying at your hotel, laugh at their costume,
and mock their peculiarities. Stare at them with the amused wonder
you bestow on the wild animals in your own Jardin des Plantes.
Swagger into the coffee-room with your hat on your head, and your
hands in your pockets, and treat the place as if it belonged to you.
In the Streets.—Wjalk about London in a costume that would
surprise by its vulgarity and slovenliness the inhabitants of a fifth-
rate French watering-place. Stand in front of the Sentries guarding
Buckingham Palace, and grin at their sine and their uniforms.
Should any of the " High Life" be resident in London at the time of
your visit, mix with them freely in the Park or at the Flower Shows,
smoking a short pipe and swinging an ash stick. Stare the Ladies
out of countenance, and laugh in the faces of the Gentlemen. If the
English are as patient as your countrymen in Paris, they will bear
your rudeness with equanimity. Push your way through crowds,
and elbow the inhabitants of London off their own pavements. If
you enter a shop, he careful to treat the attendants with marked
rudeness. It is the custom in England for people to rise and take off
their hats when thev hear the National Anthem. If you ever happen
to be present on such an occasion, be careful to remain seated and
covered. It is absurd to pay any regard to English peculiarities.
Remember that Englishmen are " Roshif s" and " Plum-puddins,"
and treat them accordingly.
At the Theatres.— Take care that your costume shall be an affront
to the audience. Lounge in your Stall, and talk in French to vour
friend, to the discomfort of your English neighbours. If you don't
understand English, let everybody in the house into the secret of
your ignorance. If the audience seem to be amused and to be enjoy-
ing themselves, stand up in your place and laugh scornfully at them.
If you get bored, leave your Stall with as much noise as possible,
and shout rather louder than the Actors as you quit the auditorium.
Seeing the Sightt.—Settle it in your own mind that France is a
thousand times finer than England, and make odious comparisons
everywhere. If you enter a place of worship, treat it as if it were a
raree-show. Appear on Sundays at St. Andrew's, or All Saints.
Margaret Street, during the sermon, armed with a guide-book, and
inspect the church with the same nonchalance that you would bestow
upon the treasures of the South Kensington Museum. Visit Green-
wich Hospital, and if the Picture Gallery is full of Englishmen, be
careful to roar with laughter at any representation of a defeat of
your fellow-countrymen, the French. If you find yourself near any
of the educated class of Britons, talk loudly of Fontenoy and the
failure of the English to take the Redan in the Crimea. Make a
joke about the Death of Nelson, and seize a suitable opportunity of
showing your contempt for the Union Jack.
Departure.—Bully the porters, and push your way through your
English fellow-travellers to your own carriage. Until you set your
foot once more upon French ground, behave like a savage. On
reaching France, throw off your offensive Bohemianism, and resume
your usual condition of quiet respectability. If you carry out the
above programme in its entirety without receiving a thrashing,
congratulate yourself upon your good luck, which, however, will
not be much greater than that enjoyed by some of the English
who imitate in Paris the deportment you will have made your own
in London.

Though he swear with no notion of trying a shot,
To reprisal his rival will promptly incline,
And suspect that his aim is to collar the lot.
This quarry seems shy; but JOHN BULL has his eye
On the Russian, who just reconnoitres, no more.
For suppose he tccre tempted a pot-shot to try,
As J.B. recollects he was tempted before!
Room enough! Ah! why cannot these Sportsmen agree
To take the Earl's tip, and steer clear of each other?

STERN NECESSITY.
1 WllAT A LOT OF SllOOTINO YOU HAVE THIS YEAH, OLD FELLOW! MUST COST YOU NO END!"
'An! THOSE DOGS, YOU KNOW. I WAS OBLIGED TO TAKE SOMETHING FOR THEK!"
THE PUBLIC WHEEL.
HOIK to preserve it on the Koud: being dfeic simple. Rules arranged
for the guidance of the accommodating Bicyclist.
LET the proprietor of every " sixty-four inch" machine take care,
in the first instance, that his approach shall not be noiseless; and to
effect this, let him—
(1) Attach a large hand dinner-bell to each of his feet;
(2) Give a prolonged blast on a full-sized trombone whenever he
turns a corner;
(3) Carry no luggage but a self-winding bird-organ and a loose
Chinese gong: and
(4) Drop fog-signals immediately he sights an approaching
omnibus.
This last precaution will probably prepare the horses for the
appearance of anything; but should they still show a restive spirit
on making out the advancing machine, let the proprietor instantly
dismount, and, assisting the conductor and passengers to blindfold
the creatures and take them gently, but firmly, out of harness, glide
away cautiously, and promise to send a policeman.
The true Bicyclist being, though a pleasure-seeker, above and
before all things a gentleman, let him never forget that, when passing
through a town, village, or hamlet, he shall—
(1) "Wear a silk-faced frock-coat, light pantaloons, lemon-
coloured kid gloves, and a chimney-pot nat;
(2) Bow with finished ton to a costennonger as to a Countess;
and
(3) When run over by a careless tandem or a well-appointed
four-in-hand, make some such good-humoured remark as,
"Oh, don't mention it!" or, "I really am so very clumsy
this morning!"
If badly hurt and put on a stretcher, let him try even to 'make a
joke. An allusion to his being " a ne'er-do-iohecl," or to the fact
that the "bicyclist's weal doesn't always follow from the driver's
whoa," is sure to tell immensely under such circumstances, and give
him a character for not being such a bad fellow, after all. This is
highly desirable.
Lastly, let him do his best on every possible occasion to disarm
public prejudice; at one moment stopping to argue politely with a
nervous Lady in her brougham, at another patting aggressive little
street Arabs fondly on the head, and amusing them with a display of
red railway flags. By these and other artifices, and by the exercise
of a firm resolution never to be encountered on the high road at all
except when carrying his machine in bits in a blue bag in the dark,
he may be sure that gradually the temporary objection to his presence
will disappear, and that he will be welcomed as an inevitable institu-
tion by a genial, generous, and easily satisfied public.
BNIP AND SNOB.
IT may be generally true that there is no accounting for tastes,
but here, in the shape of a newspaper advertisement, is an instance
of taste referrible, obviously, to an excess of avarice, and a deficient
sense of decency:—
THE AWFUL THAMES COLLISION adds another dreadful cata-
strophe to the already long list of fearful accidents that has lately come
upon us with startling effect. From such heart-rending scenes it is well we
can turn away to a subject that affects the comfort and appearance of every
Gentleman. SNOBBINS & Co., Street, who are always in the forefront
with new ideas, have for the Autumn Season a treat in store for their Patrons
in a new kind of Cloth, called the "BEAVERSKTN," very light, moderately
warm, and perfectly wonderful for wear. Suite, in best style, from Two to
Four Guineas.
This utilisation of such a calamity as the late accident on the
lliver for advertising purposes, is almost too cynical to be worthy of
even sordid and shameless Tailors of the baser sort. In order not to
give them the notoriety which they probably would like, a slight
nominal alteration—of which, perhaps, the propriety is visible—has
been made in the above example of disgusting puffery.
Domestic Economy.
IT has been suggested that the way to reduce the butcher's bill
lies in managing to make both ends meet; but for too many poor
Curates, and working-men almost equally poor, that meeting ia in-
compatible with any meat at all, and therefore with any butcher's
bill whatever.

FASHIONABLE FINERY.
AMONG the many wonders of the world at the Paris Exhibition
there is on view a wondrous bonnet, of Parisian manufacture, which
is valued at the modest sum of seven thousand francs. It is diffi-
cult to fancy how a bonnet could be made to cost so much, and its
constructor must resemble a Constructor of the Navy, at least in the
capacity of making things that cost a lot of money, and may prove
of doubtful service when put to actual use. Of similar construction,
in point of costliness and inutility, is a dress whereof a portion is
thus elegantly pictured in a fashionable newspaper:—
"The train, which is fully two yards in length, is draped in folds by faille
bows, lined with satin, and draperies of fringe silk and beads, in all the
colours of the embroidery of the dress, arc continued on the train, which ends
at the back in coquilles of moss-green faille over pink satin."
Ex pede Ilerotlem. One may form some notion of the dress from
this description of the train. Satin bows, embroidered fringes, and
moss-green faille coquilles (whatever they may be)—such things are
known to Milliners by the generic name of "trimmings," and are
what the caper-sauce and turnips were to the boiled leg of mutton,
which was served up at the soirfe Mr. Weller was invited to at
Bath. Such trimmings add but little to the beauty of a dress, but
they very greatly add to its expense; and when profusely scattered
on a train two yards in length, they must increase the length of the
bill which must be paid for it. As for their utility, they merely
serve to harbour and collect the dust> and excite the wrath of hus-
bands who are privileged to pay for them.
BIRTHDAYS IN STORE.
FROM an announcement in a newspaper, it appears that the Asso-
ciation for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom has attained
its majority. The twenty-first anniversary of its foundation was
celebrated on Sunday last, and during the week, at the Church of
All Saints, Lambeth. Many happy returns of the day to it! But
are they not likely to be too many? Should this excellent Society
continue to exist until it shall have accomplished its desirable
object, what number of anniversaries do its worthy members expect
that those who- succeed them will have to commemorate? There
are some of them who may perhaps be considered to have distin-
guished themselves.at times, rather peculiarly by an excess of zeal;
but now that the A. P. U. C. has come of age, let us hope it will prove
itself to have at the same time arrived at years of discretion.
A Colonial Question.
IN a certain " Money Article " the other day appeared a letter on
"the contemplated borrowing of the leading Australian colonies,"
recommending investment in the Funds to be thereby created. It
bore the signature of "AN AUSTRALIAN COLONIST OF FORTY-FOUR
YEARS' STANDING." The writer should have described himself
more fully. "Colonist" and " Emigrant" are not convertible terms.
An Australian Colonist of forty-four years' standing may have gone
out to Australia by a mode oi conveyance which has been discon-
tinued. How did he get there?

Dishing and Dished.
THE Army and Navy Gazette relates that a certain
Goorkha having been waylaid by six Greeks—
"The Goorkha managed to kill four of hit uuilanU with his
kookerie, and was then himself killed."
This statement seems calculated to puzzle the pro-
pagandists of spelling reform. How, they may ask,
could anyone, even the worst of kooks, kill assailants
with his kookerie? And when the Goorkha had killed
four of those who fell upon him, did the other two
then kill him, or was he himself killed with his own
kookerie also?
Good for Trade.
THE Anti-Tobacco Society, having perhaps learned
that the Police in some parts of Germany are engaged in
preventing boys under the age of sixteen from smoking
in the streets, may wish that a like measure of repres-
sion were adopted here. So may the Tobacconists; for
lads prevented from smoking openly would smoke all
the more on the sly, to the greatly increased consumption
of nicotine, with its attendant evils.
PARIS CONGRESSES.

differing objects and of various degrees of importance and self-
importance — national, international, and cosmopolitan, literary,
scientific, philanthropic, (esthetic, and politico-economic, significant
and insignificant, representing different shades of opinion, and
represented by different coloured tickets—have been conducted at
Paris since the first of May, and their number is by no means
yet complete, as will be seen by anyone taking a bird's-eye view
of the following list of influential gatherings which are confidently
expected to be held in buildings on the banks of the Seine before
the end of the year and the close of the French Exhibition.
An International Mothers' Meeting, all in full evening dress, con-

THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JACK SPRATTS.
A Tale of Modern Art and Fashion.

PART IV.
JACK Si'KATT, equally pure and guileless, and glad, as most of us
are, to find his own taste justified in his own eyes by the pood opinion
of the world, began to feel an honest pride in his wife's beauty such
as he had never quite felt before; and would not have changed her now
i'or any blessed saint, virgin, or martyr in the whole National Gallery.
The truth ia; that he had ceased to reverence those classic types.
For his artistic nature was quick to receive new impressions
and to forget old ones; and with that tendency to generalise hastily
which is so characteristic of youth, he would now state everywhere,
on his own authority as a painter, that there was no beauty out of
the English aristocracy, amongst whom he naturally included Mrs.
SPKATT and himself.
Moreover, it gratified his unselfish disposition to think that, after
all, it was not entirely for his sake that Society had given so warm a
welcome to her.
All of which did equal credit to his head and to his heart.
A more commonplace nature might have felt some jealousy; but
JACK SPRATT, who knew that he had within him all the jealous po-
tentialities of an Othelh, should any real cause for jealousy arise,
could scarcely so insult his wife's good sense as to suppose that any 01
these amiable but mindless triflers who pestered her with their well-
meant attentions, could ever be possible rivals for such an one as he.
These were indeed halcyon days!
Mrs. SPRATT, as we have seen, by a burst of laughter so opportune
that it might almost be called a stroke of genius, had cleared the
house of the trusty, but not very presentable, old friends, and JACK
had ceased to miss them.
The only surviving relative of the SPRATTS was JACK'S grandfather,
who kept an old established emporium for hosiery in St. Mary Axe;
a good-natured and affectionate old man, who loved JACK with all a
grandfather's partiality, but who had been much disgusted at his
taking to such a beggarly and disreputable trade as painting pictures
for hire.
If it had only been house painting, he could have understood it!
However, as JACK was in independent circumstances, there was
no gainsaying his right to choose his own line of life, and daiib
away as much as he liked; and the old Gentleman had swallowed
his disgust, and would often drop in of an evening at his grandson's
house.
These visits were not so pleasant to Mrs. SrRAiTas the old Gentle-
man believed.
Although circumstances had made him a well-to-do and contented
hosier, nature had intended him for a Jow comedian, or " funny"
man; and he was never happy unless he made himself the life and
soul of the party wherever he went.
He had never tired of poking fun at the trusty friends, for instance,
whose lofty aims he could not sympathise with, and whom he had
looked upon as a set of weak-minded, unwholesome, and affected
nincompoops, and would mimic to the life under their very noses;
especially PETER LEONARDO PIE.
Now Mrs. SPRATT hated fun, and thought it vulgar, as no doubt
it very often is; and as for the trusty friends, they had loathed
SPRATT Senior with deep though silent intensity, instead of doating
on him as he had fondly imagined they did.
When JACK SPRATT had become famous through the "Phayre
Sockque-darrenere." SPRATT Senior suddenly viewed picture-painting
in quite a new light, and became as proud of his always beloved
grandson, as he had hitherto been ashamed of him; and he took to
visiting at the JACK SPHATTS' regularly on Wednesday afternoons,
Mrs. SPRATT'S day "at home;" but his visits were more unwelcome
to that ladv than ever.
At first the rank and fashion he met there awed him into silence
and discreet behaviour; he had never seen a live Lord before, for
Swelldom does not usually buy its drawers and socks in St. Mary
Axe.
And when he held his tongue and did not play the fool, he was
rather ornamental than otherwise, being of truly venerable aspect,
and scrupulously neat about his person.
But as soon as he discovered how easy and unconventional really
good Society can be, how familiarly the glittering Swells would treat
Mrs. SPKATT, and how unceremoniously they would bear themselves
towards that great genius, her husband (for they had forgotten by
this time that he was a great genius, and looked upon him as a
fool, or something worse), the irrepressible old humorist recovered
his wonted assurance, and became once more the life and soul of the
party.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

EARLY DAYS.
Little Wife. "On, CHAKLES DEAR, THERE'S THE PRETTIEST LITTLE FILLY YOU EVER SAW, DOWN AT THE HOME FARM."
Charles (expressively). "I KNOW A PRETTIER."
It must be owned that his behaviour was very trying, and betrayed
a great deficiency in social tact.
For instance he would, unasked, insist on favouring the company
with long-forgotten comic songs (which had lost all point for the
present generation), and imitations of the actors of a hundred years
ago; and the less Mrs. SPEATT and her guests would laugh, the more
he would laugh himself, and the more he would persevere in trying
to merit their applause by further efforts in the same line.
Then he would chaff the page who brought in the tea, and inquire
of him if SALLY the Cook were as good-looking as ever, and still
reciprocated his fond affection.
Or else he would hand his business cards to Viscounts and Guards-
men, and ask fine Ladies where they bought their hose, and volun-
teer to serve them with a superior article at Civil Service prices, to
be delivered at their own doors, carriage paid, and so forth.
At last a day came when he went just a little too far.
The Duke of PENTONVTLLE was at Mrs. SPEATT'S, alone; for so
stupendous were his Grace's rank and fashion, so advanced his age,
and so respected his character, that it was thought good form for
Viscounts and Guardsmen and such like humble Swells to make
themselves scarce when he came—nor did they presume to knock at
Mrs. SPRATT'S door when the PENTONVTLLE liveries were seen to be
waiting outside.
JACK'S Grandfather, who was quite wanting in this particular kind
of delicacy, knocked at Mrs. SPEATT'S door without the slightest
diffidence, and entered the house, and walked straight into the
drawing-room after the fashion of LISTON in Paul Pry, exclaiming,
"I hope I don't intrude!"
The Duke stared at him with cold surprise, and immediately
rose to take his leave. As he stooped, with old-fashioned courtesy,
to kiss Mrs. SPEATT'S lily-white hand (into which he had just
forced a costly trinket), the tail-pockets of his well-fitting green
cut-away coat were seen to gape, and Mr. SPRATT Senior took the
opportunity of dropping into each of those ducal receptacles a printed
circular-which stated that, owing to the sudden break-up of a well-
known West-End Firm, SPEATT & Co. had been able to effect exten-
sive purchases in underclothing at an extraordinary advantage,
which enabled them to supply the Nobility, Gentry, and Public
generally, with first-rate articles at an unprecedented low rate—a
handsome discount allowed for cash.
JACK SPRATT appeared on the scene as soon as he heard his Grand-
father's voice, but it was too late to interfere; and the unconscious
Duke, though much huffed at the untimely interruption, left the
room with all the stately ease and high-bred self-control of a great
British nobleman of the old school, ignoring alike old SPRATT'S
respectful obeisances, and young SPEATT'S friendly and familiar
farewell; while the ends of the two printed circulars stuck symme-
trically out.
Buttons, who admired old SPRATT more than anybody else in the
world, fairly exploded at this piece of practical fun.
But Mrs. SPRATT could contain herself no longer, and gave her
Grandfather-in-law such a piece of her mind as at last enlightened
him about the estimation in which she and her Swell friends held his
powers of entertaining the company; so that he left the house bewil-
dered and aghast, with tears m his poor old eyes, and all the jokes
crushed out of his facetious old heart for many a long day to come.
Nor did he ever cross that threshold again, much to the grief of
the twins, who, although aesthetically reared, could not help adoring
their mirthful and indulgent old Great-Grandpapa, who made them
laugh so.
And to JACK'S grief also, for he had a warm heart, and was tenderly
attached to the old man, in spite of his "larks."
But in the exciting whirl of his new life, in which the days
flew by like hours, a very few hours sufficed to obliterate these fond
regrets.
And JACK SPEATT felt no little elation in the thought that all their
associates, however frivolous, were at least " Ladies and Gentlemen"
a term which was constantly on his lips at this time, and which he
only applied to those who were alike well-born, fashionably dressed,
highly connected, and "in Society."
And now that Mrs. SPEATT had so effectually disposed of that in-
convenient old Grandfather of his, he considered himself as good as
any of them; and bore himself accordingly; being politely distant
to his inferiors, affable to recognised merit of a high order, free and
easy with his equals, the Swells, and acknowledging no superior
under Royalty.

HOW TO MAKE A FORTUNE IN FIVE MINUTES.
(With Mr. Punch's compliments to those it may concern.)
SCENE—A respectable-looking Office, filled with Serious Young Clerks.
In the distance is seen the Partners' Room, in which an Elderly
Member of the Firm is discovered leisurely reading the Money
Article of the " Times" through apince-nez. Enter A. WEAXE
BDXL, Esq., bent on a "flutter. He is ushered into the Partners'
Room by the most serious of the Serious Young Clerks.
Elderly Member of the Firm (looking up from his paper in a
leisurely manner). Yes, Sir?
Mr. Bull. I have called because I think I would like to invest a
little money in United Hottentots.
Elderly Member of the Firm (softly). Yes, yes. It is not alto-
gether an investment we as a rule would recommend. The security
is entirely composed of the bones that have accumulated for several
ceniuries in the royal tomb. Hispresent Majesty, too, has not alto-
gether behaved with candour. We are told, on very fair authority,
that he has surreptitiously hypothecated the remains of his ancestors
to other and secret trusts. On the whole, we would rather recommend
Consols—they are decidedly safer.
Mr. Bull. Thanks, yes. But. you see, United Hottentots are
evidently going up. Yesterday they were at 39j, and to-day they
are about 43. Now, if I bought in—
Elderly Member of the Firm (politely). Perhaps we had better
see what the Market has been recently before we decide upon any-
thing. (Touches bell, when enter the most serious of all the Serious
Young Clerks.) Mr. GRAVESTONE, can you tell us, please, what
United Hottentots have been doing during the past few days?
Mr. Gravestone. Certainly, Sir. On Monday they were at 53$;
on Tuesday at 18; on Wednesday they touchea 45; yesterday they
were at 394; and to-day they are at 53.
Mr. Hull. I beg your pardon. You mean 43.
Mr. Gravestone. They were 43 when you came in, Sir, but they
have had a slight rise since you entered the office. For the last
forty-eight hours they huve been comparatively steady—for them.
[Exit.
Elt/fi-/'/ Member of the Firm. I am afraid they are a little high.
I think, perhaps, you had better wait.
Mr. Gravestone (putting his head into the room slowly). I may add,
Sir, that since I left, United Hottentots have gone down to 23J to |.
Mr.'Bull (excitedly). Buy in, buy in at once! I will have five-
no, ten of them.
Mr. Gravestone (on the Elderly Member of the Firm bowing his
head). Very well, Sir. [Exit.
Mr. Bui) (nervously). I am sure to make over them, eh?
Elderly Member of the Firm. Well, they used certainly once to
pay their coupons.
Mr. Bull. Oh. but I shall sell out the moment they go up two.
E/der/t/ Member of the Firm (with grace surprise). Dear me! I
had no idea that you intended to speculate in a time bargain. It is
not at all the sort of thing we like. In fact we do not undertake the
"carrying over " business.
Mr. Gravestone (putting in his head). We have bought Ten Thou-
sand Hottentots, Sir, at 4(>4. It was the best price we could obtain.
There had been a slight rise before we could get over to the house to
execute your order.
Mr. Bull (blankly). Ten Thousand!
Mr. Gravestone. You said ten, I think, Sir? [Exit.
Mr. Bull. But if they go down one I stand to lose a hundred
pounds?
Elderly Member of the Firm (leisurely doing a little sum on a piece
of blotting paper). Rather more, with our commission—we charge
Half-a-C'rown for every £100 of Stock. Time bargains are very
dangerous things. We usually recommend our clients to leave them
alone. [Takes up the " Times" again and recommences its pen/set/.
Mr. Bull. Oh what tcitt my wife say! Pray do send over to see if
they have gone up.
Elderly Member of the Firm (politely relinquishing his paper).
There is no. necessity. We have a little instrument here which re-
cords all the business done on the Stock Exchange. You see it marks
the various ^prices on a piece of tape. (Points to an electric self-
acting printing machine under a glass case.) Would you like to see
the mechanism?
Mr. Bull (eagerly). I would far sooner examine the tape!
Elderly Member of the Firm. Here you see. (Reading.) "12
o'clock. Moon Trams. 2CJ to J." (Tramways are not bad invest-
ments.) "Esquimaux Prefs. 103 to 101." (It is their first loan—
they have borrowed at sixteen per cent.—new to the business—we
can recommend them.) "United Hottentots, 47."
Mr. Bull (exritedly). They have gone up!
Elderly Member of the Firm, So far. (Continues reading.) "12.2.
United Hottentots, 49."
Mr. Bull (more excitedly). Hur
Elderly Member of the Firm (interrupting Mr. BULL'S cheer). I
beg your pardon. "12.4. United Hottentots, 46J. 12.5. United
Hottentots, 45. 12.C. United Hottentots—
Mr. Bull (interrupting). Stop! stop! Why, I have lost £150 in
three minutes!
Elderly Member of the Firm '.(doing another sum on a piece of
blotting-paper). A trifle over, with our commission. Would you
like to lose a little more?
Mr. Bull (very excitedly). No, no! What shall I do—buy—sell—
or what?
Elderly Member of the Firm (very leisurely). Well, if you wish to
conclude the transaction, you will •
Mr. Bull {impatiently). Yes, yes?
Elderly Meniber of the Firm (playing with his eye-glass). You
will sell the stock you have already bought.
Mr. Bull (at his icit's-end). Well, what shall I dp?
Elderly Member of the Firm (calmly). It is difficult to advise.
(Strokes his chin.) Of course, if they go up, you might clear a trifle,
and, if they went down, you might lose a trifle. We do not usually
recommend our clients to have very much to do with time bargains.
You see
Mr. Bull (in despair). And, while you are talking, they are going
down like wildfire.
Elderly Member of the Firm (mildly). Well, I dare say they are
fluctuating a little. If you like, I will look at the tape. Ah, here
they are again. "12'9. United Hottentots, 37J."
Mr. Bull (jumping up from his chair). Oh deart I shall be ruined!
(Rushing into the outer office.) Here, any one, go and sell five
thousand United Hottentots at any price you can—but mind you get
rid of them! [Returns to Partners' Room, panting.
Elderly Member of the Firm (looking at him vaguely, and then
recognising him). Ah, to be sure. I think, Sir, you said you wished
to buy some United Hottentots. It is not altogether an investment
we as a rule would recommend, but
Mr. Gravestone (putting in his head). I have sold them, Sir. They
fluctuated a great deal. They went down as low as 14}, but I caught
them on the hop, and got out neatly at 40.
Mr. Bull (wiping his forehead with his handkerchief). Thank you.
And I have lost?

A SABBATARIAN SUCCESS.
THE Blackpool anil Fleet-
wood Gazette narrates at
large the particulars of a
munificent act of charity
performed at Blackpool by
the Managers of the >Vinter
Gardens at that town, with
the assistance of the Rev.
C. H. WAIXWBIOHT, Vicar
of Christ Church. The
Managers announced that,
for the benefit of the dis-
tressed survivors of the
Thames Collision, they
would .give a concert of
sacred music at the gardens
on Sunday afternoon—ad-
mission sixpence a head.
Mr. WATNWRIGHT threat-
ened that, if they did so, he
would prosecute them under
the Sabbatarian Statute 21
George III. The Managers
therefore concluded, as our
American Cousins say, to
give their Concert admission
gratis; a. collection to be
made after the performance,
or rathert as a good work
done on a Sunday, it may be called, the Service. By this ex-
pedient they obtained £157, to be transferred to the Mansion House
Fund for the charitable purpose abovementioned.
Now this sum very much exceeds the amount which would have
been taken at the doors, and, for the difference—the excess of the
money they got over what they expected — they may thank the
Reverend Gentleman; for if he had let them alone, and not inter-
fered to prevent them from executing their benevolent intention in
their own way, they would have netted so much the less for the
relief of their suffering fellow-creatures, and so much the less misery
would have been unrelieved.
If he has duly_ considered this, Mr. WAUTWIUGHT must feel highly
gratified with his attempt to prevent a performance of a devotional
character with a pious object, which he, although a Clergyman of
the Church of England, and not a Scotch Presbyterian Minister or
old woman, deems a desecration of the " Sabbath."
The Public at large, too, as well as the Blackpool people, have
reason for gratitude to the Rev. Mr. WArywiueHT. In a letter
addressed, in view of the intended Concert, to the Editor of the
abovenamed Journal, he explains why he objected to sacred music,
designed for the succour of destitution, on a Sunday afternoon. In
that beneficent design he beheld only a snake in the grass, otherwise
our old introductory acquaintance of the lever kind. "The truth,"
he says, "is the Directors are trying to introduce the thin end of
the wedge, to test how far the Public are prepared to support Sunday
entertainments." By causing them to find a legal way of giving a
Sunday Concert, he has not only furthered the introduction of the
wedge, but helped to drive its thin end in considerably farther. In
so far he has promoted the cause of innocent and rational Sunday
recreation; and we must not look a gift horse in the mouth, even
although religious intolerance may possibly be found under his
tongue.
In the Cellar.
Lord Seaconsfield (to his Sutler). Let the old Port stand. Don't

ADIEU TO THE AUSTRALIANS.

ing success."—Newspaper Report.
THE Australians came down like a wolf on the fold.
In a trice the M.C.C. were caught, stumped, or bowled:
Not a batsman 'gainst SPOFFOKTH " the demon " could stay,
And the match, a rare marvel, was won in a day.
They have travelled since then many cricketfields through,
From Swansea to Sheffield, from Cambridge to Crewe;
And though here and there scoring a casual " duck,"
They have everywhere shown us good play and good pluck.
They have given us rare proof that the noblest of games
May be learned near the Murray as well as the Thames:
That courage, good temper, and patience abound

In run-spangled fetters of fancy-fed love.
The fuss of the proser. the whine of the canter,
Are foreign as falsehood and fudge to the tongue,
Which has lent a fine charm e'en to blarney and banter,
And glamour of grace o'er formalities flung.
Yet serious business has found you no fumbler,
Fun's dear at the figure when toil it would shirk;
But who would be such an inveterate grumbler
As chide a good workman who sings at his work?
Small wonder that Canada sorrows at losing
A chief who can rule and not bungle or bore,
Who, working or playing, is aye found suffusing
The wisdom of MONCK with the fancy of MOOHE.
Whilst pinchbeck Imperialism is posing
As England's new idol, 'tis pleasant indeed
To find one who contrives, without gammon or glosing,
To bind branch with branch of our old Island breed.
Heart ties, after all, form the only safe tether,
If we and our stout Western scion agree,
In fair or foul weather, to foot it together,
Large thanks will be due to such bricks as Lord P.
Punch swells the full chorus that sounds from Ontario,
He '11 welcome him home, from our Colony far,
Who, steadfast as DOUGLAS while gay as LOTHARIO,
Good jest will not mull and tough task will not mar.
Let us hope your successor in brain's not behind you,—
He '11 find it no trifle to stand in your shoes,—
But JOHN BULL a fresh berth must right speedily find you,
For in faith, my dear Lord, you are too good to lose!
Self-Coronation.
AT a meeting lately held at Savona, in Italy, to celebrate the
anniversary of the Genevan Alabama Award. Signer FILIPANTI, a
Deputy, was loudly applauded on declaring that Germany "would
cover herself with glory if she allowed Alsace-Lorraine to elect by
plebiscite between France and Germany." Prince BISMABCK, per-
naos, is of opinion that if he permitted Germany to do any such
thing, he would be covering himself with a fool's cap.

Hi
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
On the Wenthei—A Word to the Wise—Genevieve de Srabant at the Alhambra—An Algerian Ballei—A Signature—And a Postscript.
AIB SIB,
THE summer has gone. I announce it.
It is so. By NEGBETTI AND ZAMBEA! but it
is cold!!
Before proceeding any further I wish to
protest. Somebody, no matter who it was, a
somebody, and not a nobody, wrote to me. and
expressed himself thus:—"I send you this,"
(i.e.,ij some information) "for your behoof."
Now, Sir, what did he mean by my'' be-hoof?"
Am I a quadruped? Did he intend to imply
this? Have many people " be-hoof s?" If so,
are they shod on their " be-hoof s?" And are
these the Shoddies? Are certain persons fitted
up with " 6e-hoofs," just as carriages are with
"C-springs?" Let these questions be an-
swered. I do not pause for a reply, or I shall
be all behind—I mean all "behoof —with my
letter to you, respected Sir. Now for the
Alhambra.
There is not one of Beauty's daughters in all
Opera Souffe to whom I am more deeply
attached than Genevieve de Srabant: and,
Tom the absolutely crowded state of the Alhambra on the night ot
my Hoyal visit, the public seems to join me in singing " So say all of us."
Mr. CHABLES MOBTON has done well and wisely in producing Genevieve, and
wtllcr and wiselier in securing the sendees of Miss EMILY SOLDENE for Dro-
IJHII, Miss CONSTANCE LOSEBY for the heroine, Messrs. FELIX BUEY and
MARSHAL for the immortal two Gendarmes. "Too many cooks spoil the
broth," is a rule with its exception here: for Drogan being one cook, and
one cook—one AYNSLEY COOK—being Cocorico Duke of Srabant, the flavour
of the Opera Broth is certain to be improved. With such a JENNY YAYVE
(as " our friends in the front" call her), how can we wonder at Drogan being
Led by the no»e by
Miss CONSTANCE LOSEBY P
Miss SOLDENE is the right artiste in the right place. She fills the stage with her presence, and, what is still more important, she fills
the house with her voice. Her singing voice I mean, not her speaking voice, but the talk is really objectless at the Alhambra, and
DUCBOW'S oft-quoted order to "cut the cackle and come to the 'osses," applies directly here, when the sooner the cackle is cut. and
the quicker we get to the music, singing, and dancing, the better the public are pleased, invariably. I should like to hear a violent duett
between Miss SOLDENE and Mdlle. ItosE BELL; the two Ladies par excellence for such a stage as that of the Alhambra. Couldn't they
tear passion, and caps to rags, in a sort of Billingsgate quarrelling scene like that in La Fille de Madame Angot.'
As to the story of JENNY VAYVE. Heavens I I've seen it many a time and oft in Paris and London, and if I can make head or tail of
it I 'm what—according to the authority of Mr. Weller's legal adviser—the Lord Chancellor said he was in confidence—and, of course,
in a Pickwickian sense.
But who cares for the details of a story in an Opera Souffe where all goes briskly, brightly, and merrily, and where all ends
happily? Who drilled those young Ladies in Scene 2, Act I. 'i They "re as nearly satisfactory as any I 've ever seen on the English
Opera Souffe stage; for somehow, no matter who has them in hand, "Our Girls," like true Britons, never, never, never will be slaves;
and the ensemble cannot be obtained, which in Paris is the result of tyrannic rehearsal. Mr. H. B. FAHNIE, Librettist, and Stage
Director, ought to be able to do it, if any one can; but even for him it is a Fanuese Herculean Task. Suffice it that at the Alhambra—

1 Like DON FERDINANDO,
They do what they can do,"—
which isn't exactly the quotation. But no matter. As for the young Ladies themselves, not even the Alhambra Co. Limited, could expect
their cheres to be doing better. First Act went admirably. The Serenade, sung by Mile. SOLDENE, and LOSEBY winning a double tncore.
The Second Act. I suppose the words of CHAHLES MABTEL'S song are not intended to be a secret P If they are, Mr. KELLEHEB keeps
close to his instructions, as all I could catch, listening with rapt attention, was something about "Madame TIISSAUD" (which I
applauded—I always do when I hear anything about Madame TUSSATTD—), and "The Great Crusaders." The business of the song,
executed by Our Girls, with rapiers, is very effective.
As the Automaton Hermit—or Jack in a Box-tree—Mr. J. DALLAS was very funny; but Dragon's song, however well given, is a trifle
tedious; and it must be, when one feels that a sneeze from Miss CONSTANCE LOSEBY is quite a relief to the audience, as well as to
herself,—bless her!
How many encores the two Gendarmes obtained I ceased to count. Messrs. MAESHAI, and FELIX BTJEY are admirable, the only fault
being that the latter, Full Private Pituu, is inclined to overdo the business by just so much of a hair'sbreadth, as endangers the criap-
ness of the marked time on which the success of the duett greatly depends. Of all his burlesque duetts this is OFFENBACH'S master-
piece. But what shall he do who comes after the two Gendarmes? Virtually, the Opera is over; and. feeling this, M. JACOBI has
brought into the last Scene a very telling Ballet-^I don't know what it tells, but as may be literally said of a Ballet, cela va sans dire, i.e.
it "goes" without saying anything—which, with his inspiriting and melodious accompaniment, now graceful, now grotesque, gives a
brilliant finish to as bright and as satisfactory an all-round performance as has been seen for many a long night at the Alhambra, and
which I have no doubt will be seen for many a long night to come.
By the way, Miss ROSA'S spirited dancing, and her leap into the Bohemian Boy's arms, are things to be seen and applauded.
Then followed about 10'45 (too late) a Ballet of Action, the story of which was written, or danced, by Mr. JAMES ALBEEY, the Author
of The Two Eases, which was not a Ballet, though the name sounds like it. I suppose the lateness of the hour prevented my being able
to follow the story, which went away on any number of legs, and I did not feel inclined to pursue it.
I gathered from what I saw that an elegant Spanish Princess—who never appeared less at her ease than when seated in a large
chair, for her legs, except when used for dancing, seemed to inconvenience her muchlv—was, somehow or other, ill-treated by an elderly
and apparently inebriated Turkish Gentleman, whom, at first, I took to be her father. Further consideration caused me to alter my opinion,
for how should a Spanish Princess be the daughter of a Turk—whether inebriated or not is no matter? So I concluded he was
some relation: uncle perhaps. He was always attracting bis niece's attention to one of his fingers. Why? Had he hurt it? Did he
want sticking-plaster? For the life of me I cannot make out why that disreputable old Turk bothered the Spanish Princess about »uch
a trifle. Well—then a Gentleman in blue took a spear and a shield from the Princess, and made a great fuss about going to do some-
thing, but did nothing. Well—then vague people Drought in gilded coal-scuttles for the Princess's inspection, but I fancy she didn't

want to furnish, and so they took them all away again. About this
time the inebriated Turkish Uncle, who had been looking daggers at
everybody and everything, specially the coal-scuttles (he must have
been very drunk), suddenly retired, either to take some more drink
privately, or to recover from his past excess.
Well—that's the story, so far. It isn't very interesting, is it?
After this there appeared a Sea Nymph, and she and the Spanish
Princess both fell in love with the man in blue. Then everyone
broke into a dance of joy and cymbals, all, that is, except the tall
Turkish Guards, who stood gloomily at the wines, their heads
wrapped up as though suffering from severe face-aches and mumps,
probably caught from standing night after night in the violent
draughts of the Palace " wings.
Then the Sea Nymph showed her sea legs, and as the scene
changed, I looked at my watch, and finding it was 11'30, and the
story no further advanced, I said, Farewell unhappy Princess!
Adaio. Sea Nymph! Good-bye, Man in Blue and Drunken Uncle, I
am off to get a cool American lemon squash, and a full-flavoured
Havannah, and thanking you much, HI JACOBI, for the capital
dance music, 1 am, Ladies and Gentlemen,
Very truly,
TOUE REPRESENTATIVE.
P.S.—"A New York audience yawned through the play of
Olivia," writes a correspondent in America to the Era. The fact is
in this instance, "the play's" not " the thing." The rehearsals
and stage management, and the capital cast, made it what it was at
the Court Theatre. If the " getting-up" on the American stage is
not equal to that at the Court, the getting xip in front of the house—
and going out—will more than balance it.
To be seen—Mr. BYRON'S new piece. Conscience Money. His last
was A Fool and his Money. Still sticking to the Money—so they 're
not so soon parted—but now conscientiously. On the very best
authority (except my own) I hear it is a success. Crede BYRON. A
rule for Critics should be, "Don't judge by First Appearances." Of
the popularity of sterling melodrama, you can judge t>y visiting The
Two Orphans (Messrs. D'ENNERY and CORMON) at the Olympic,
and of the same Two Authors' success you will have at the Adelphi
a most convincing Proof.
This is the last week of Messrs. GATTI'S Concerts at Covent
Garden. More's the pity. The other night a young Composer, as
gifted as amiable (I dined with him), took me to hear Mr. ARTHUR
SULLIVAN'S Orchestra perform Mr. WAITER AUSTIN'S Fire King
Overture, first time in London; and after that we heard, with
delight, Miss CUMMINGS' rendering of The Lost Chord, music by
A. SULLIVAN, M.D., or rather by The SULLIVAN, M.D. On this
occasion the .Lost Chord was Ong-chord. After this Jeu de mot,
I bowed my acknowledgments from my Private Box, and withdrew.
Was it really?
WE object to hearing a Lady's name shouted out at the top of a
guard's voice, or at the top of a guard's-van for the matter of that,
as is daily done at Herne Hill Station, L. C. & D. line, when the
guard and the porters sing out stentorianly, " Victoria Forward!"
Who is VICTORIA FORWARD? There was a Lady came over here,
some time since, Victoria something — American she was — who
lectured, rather warmly, on Woman's Eights. Was she VICTORIA
FORWARD? But anyhow, why shout out her name at Herne Hill?
A BRAND NEW ONE.
Now then, where will you find the true "poetry of motion"?
Give it up? Why, in your lawn Tennyson, of course!
N.B.—This joke may be tried with effect on the One Man now left
in Rotten Row.

THE STEEL HOESE.
THE Iron Horse a (rood one is. as the saying is, to go
Behind him whilst he flies full speed as ye travel to and fro.
Great wonders for mankind 'tis true that Iron Horse has done.
But you talk about the Iron Horse as though there were but one.
And yet there is another Horse, in kind of iron frame;
For I bestride a steed of steel whose mettle's full as game;
My roadster: when I 'm on his back, few things we go not by,
Whether on wheels, or legs, or both, my Bicycle and I.
The Steel Horse ne'er in stable or stall stands eating off his head;
He neither craves for corn nor hay—nor asks he coal instead.
Nor doth he more to drink require than he demandeth feed.
No water he lacks; and I pay no tax on account of my cheap Steel Steed.
My Steel Horse can convey but one, when he takes me up and down;
He turns no lovely rural wild to close and sultry town.
No ugly stuccoed settlements uprise upon his track;
He bears no travellers to the bourne wherefrom they ne'er come back.
Occasion he for gambling none gives Cads of low degree.
The Betting-men, the Sporting Gents, can't get at him or me.
No slinking knaves environ him, and dog his ins and outs;
No jockeys, ostlers, stable-boys, no tipsters, and no touts.
'Tis true that he on level ground alone can hold his pace,
And the Steel Horse would avail me nought to win a steeplechase,
Bear me 'cross country, after hounds, o'er hedge and ditch and gate;
Fling me, and make me leave my friends to mourn my sudden fat«.
But 0, my Steel Horse never jibs, my Steel
Horse never shies;
He ne'er takes fright and bolts with me—at
the worst can but capsize.
Through the 'pikes we roll exempt from
toll, as befits a Centaur free.
There is nought to pay on the Queen's high-
way for my Bicycle and me!
SIB,
RULES IN EHYME.
(To the Editor.)
Is the letters that have appeared in
the Times relative to the Rules of Naviga-
tion.the poetical regulations of the Board
of Trade have been quoted. As for
example:—
"When on your starboard red appear,
It is your duty to keep clear—
To act as judgment says is proper,
To port, or starboard, back her, stop her."
The Poet is, of course, kept on the pre-
mises. Who is the Bard of Trade? Is
there a Trade Laureate? Is the place open
to competition? If so, "Here stands a
post" that I '11 go in for. But in what
direction? Whv not for Cab-drivers I* or
for Police? Why not all regulations in
verse, and the verse to music? Here's a
specimen:—
AVhen you want to reach the Bank,
Hail a Cabman from the rank.
If it is a shilling fare
Do not pay him till you 're there.
And, if you 've got any sense,
Do not give him eighteenpencc.
Here's another:—
Give a Cabman just his fare,
My! how he will cuss and swear!
Give him half-a-crown too much,
And his hat, perhaps, he '11 touch.
Rule for Cabmen, in another measure:—
No matter where you 're going, any day,
Through Covent Garden is the shortest way.
"Wait for the Waggon" you can sing, sans doute,
You '11 wait for lots of waggons on this route.
Rule for Impecunious Passenger:—
Order the Cabman whom you cannot pay
Without the Burlington Arcade to stay.
Say, " Wait forme in Piccadilly, friend!"
Then you '11 retire by the other end.
Rule for ordinary driving:—
To the right you want to go,
You must pull the right, you know;
For you'd t>e of sense bereft,
If, for right, you pulled the left.
Or you must be very tight,
When you think the left is right.
Advice to " Crawlers " unoccupied :—
Crawl along until you see
Some one crossing cautiouslee.
Almost knock him down, then cry,
"Now then, stoopid, mind jour eye!"
As to Excuses, here's the rule :—
When you have a jibbini? horse,
Say he 'B rather fresh, of course.
If he kicks like mad, you '11 say,
"Bless you, Sir, that's only play!"
If each step's a dangerous trip,
Say, " lie never makes a slip."
These are some few suggestions, which
may be taken up by your numerous Poetical
Correspondents, and applied all round. In
the meantime, please remember,
YOUE POOR POET.

AN UNWIELDY CAB-FARE.
THE LAMENT OF THE VASE.
(Lately echoed from the Louvre.)
FASHIONED by heroic hands,
Graced I once old PRIAM'S table,
Saw the rage of Arrive bands,
Watched sweet HELEN fade in fable:
Till fair Athens rose, and I,
'Mid her cherished treasures numbered,
Told her of the times gone by,
Of the dead that with them slumbered.
And as cycles sank away.
Rome, the mighty spoiler, found me
Witness of her splendid sway,
While her triumph rang around me:
Witness—till her sand was run,
And. in whirl of Northern thunder,
Trampling Vandal, Goth, and Hun
Kent her giant strength in sunder!
Yet, intact was I, and whole,
Destined for the joy of sages
Thankful for this scanty dole
Wrested from the grasping ages.
And they gently took me hence,
Pondered o'er my mist-veiled story;
Honoured me with throne and fence,
Set me up in single glory.
Yet in vain they marked my grace,
Marshalled savans round about me—
Where I stood an empty space,
Says the world must live without me!
Yes'.—for spite cost, care,—each boon,—
Tenderness that quite abashed me,—
Suddenly, this afternoon,
Came a British Mob—and smashed me.'
A Juvenile Attempt.
THE Porte is itself again. A telegram
from Constantinople announces that:—
"The Turkish authorities are re-established at

HOW TO ENJOY A HOLIDAY IN PAR IN.
(By a Cynic, tcho has Attempted it.)
TAKE with you twice as much luggage as you can possibly
require, to get lost on the railway, and to cause inconvenience and
waste of time at the Custom House.
Depart by a train that entails getting up in the middle of the
night, and breakfasting hurriedly in the early morning.
^_Cross over the sea in a ridiculously small steamer, which, over-
crowded with passengers and luggage, rolls at the approach ot every
wavelet; or select a larger vessel infested with pickpockets.
Still suffering from the effects of a disagreeable voyage, hurry into
a stuffy railway carriage, and spend half a dozen hours or so in it on
your road to Paris.
Arrived in the gay Capital, select a large and comfortless Hotel,
where you will bo known as a number and treated as a cvpher.
Dine at a bad and expensive table d'hute, where you will be invited
to partake of a morsel of four-and-twenty dishes in half as many
minutes.
Hurry away to an overcrowded Theatre, and sit out for five hours
a play either painfully frivolous, grossly immoral, absurdly sensa-
tional, or a combination of all three.
Rise early the next morning, and visit your favourite haunt in
search of breakfast. Spend a couple of hours in the midst of a
hungry throng, all attempting in vain to attract the notice of a few
overworked waiters, vaguely carrying about some under-cooked
dishes. Eat what you can secure, pay what you are forced to give,
and come out half-starved and grumbling.
Lounge on the Boulevards, and submit to be elbowed off the pave-
ment by the " brazen youth " of Dalston, Brixton, and other equally
fashionable suburbs, and a few scores of thousands of personally-
conducted Tourists.
Look into the shops, and notice that they are filled with English
goods.
Leave the streets, and, for the first time for many years, "do"
the sights. Discover, when it is too late to retrace your steps, that
the "Monuments of Paris " are in the hands of a gigantic crew of
plebeian, uncultivated, and unappreciative excursionists.
As a last resource, visit the Exhibition and renew your acquaint-
ance with the wonders of the Rue de Rivoli, Regent Street, Fnedrich
filtrasse, Broadway, and several foreign imitations of the Tottenham
Court Road.
Weary of the well-known triumphs of commerce, as displayed in
chocolate drops, writing desks, easy chairs, and other equally inter-
esting articles, walk into the Machinery Department, and secure a
headache by watching the rather clumsy manufacture of a hat, a
pill-box, or a pair of braces.
To regain your habitual calm, visit the Fine Art Galleries, and
inspect the tarnished glories (?) of past and forgotten Royal Academv
Exhibitions, Salons, and other Annual Collections of Pictures held
in different parts of Europe.
Still in search of composure, stroll into the grounds and gaze upon
theatrical representations of Asiatic houses and Japanese shop-
keepers selling their native manufactures at exorbitant rates.
Tired to death of the Exhibition, return to your hotel in a badly-
horsed, highly-priced, and broken-down Victoria, and find the place
more crowded, and more uncomfortable than ever.
Spend a month or six weeks dismally, finding Paris without the
Parisians, the Boulevards without the glories of the shops, and the
Theatres without the novelties.
Then, when you are quite bored, crush into a crowded train,
embark in a thronged boat, and get home as best you can, thankinv
your lucky stars the while that you are once more housed in London.
"Cum Grano."
OUR Muscular Christian friend, MILO ALLSIDES, hearing Mr.
CORNET GRAJN mostjustly spoken of as "one out of ten thousand,"

COCK-A-DOODLE-DOO ! »
STRONG, BUT PLEASANT.
A REPORT in a Salopian paper presents to the imagination a vivid
idea of the sanitary state of the district under the dominion of the
"Wellington Board of Guardians. At a meeting of those authorities
the other day—
"Mr. H. J. TAYLOR, Sanitary Inspector, reported as to the existence of
nuisances in various parts of the district, and in most instances orders for
abatement were made.
The gravity—and graveolence—of those nuisances can be under-
stood from the statement, immediately succeeding the above, that—
"The Inspector also reported that in one case there were four pigsties
within three feet of a cottage, and that the filth from the sties ran down to
the base of the house, and caused a great nuisance.
"Mr. JERYIS: A farmhouse is no good unless there is plenty of manure
about it. (Laughter.)
"The CHAIRMAN observed that he did not consider any pigsty a nuisance.
—No action was taken in the matter."
If no action was taken in the matter—truly matter in the wrong
place—of the four pigsties whose details are described in the forego-
ing quotation—what, as regards cleanliness and odour, must have
been the state of things in the various cases in most of which orders
for the abatement of it were made? The thought of it is enough to
make any gentleman hold his nose; except, of course, the member of
the Wellington Board of Guardians who thinks that "a farmhouse
is no good unless it be surrounded with the material which he
named; and save also the Chairman, who said that "he did not con-
sider any pigsty a nuisance," and to whose nostrils perhaps all
pigsties are nosegays only more or less agreeably odoriferous.
Taste beyond the Tweed.
FAIKIBK, Lord KOSEBERY the other day informed a meeting of its

whether it was possible that either Scotch Music or Scotch Cookery
could be improved? What three dishes are there comparable to

of music are equal to " Scuts, ivha ha'e," "Auld Lang Syne, and

Know the Times' paragraph subjoined it may appear that an unhappy peasant has had
to suffer severely for a slight offence, and that Shropshire Justices make a preposterous
account of
"RABBITS.—JOHN LEARY, a labourer, with two children, hns, by the County Magistrates at Ludlow,
been committed to gaol for twenty-one days, without the option of paying a fine, for taking a rabbit out
of a trap in a hedge at Dilbury at night, and also required to give £20 bail not to offend again for twelve
months."
But could the prisoner have paid a fine? and would any labourer be able to do that
unless he were an habitual poacher? These questions are to be asked before it is assumed
that the County Magistrates at Ludlow are Squires who regard rabbits as sacred animals,
A Gentleman, very particular as to
locality, told me he felt a little uncertain
of his position in Doubty Street, W.C. I
replied that it, was spelt Doughty." We
argued. " 'Dough,'" says he, " spells'Doe';
therefore it's Doety Street." "But," I
replied, " ' Plough' spells' Plow;' therefore
'tis Dowty Street." "' Tough '" says he,
"is pronounced 'Tuff;' so 'tis Duffty
Street." "If you come to that," I re-
joined, " ' Hough,' spells ' Hock,'and there-
fore ' tis Dockty Street." This argumentum
ad " hock " made us thirsty, and we quaffed.
There was a great deal to be said on both
sides; more than fits into this paragram.
Yes, "paragram" is the word. Why not
"paragram r" You send me a telegram,
not a tclegrapA. You will telegraph me a
telegram, and I will paragraph you a para-
gram. When the Learned Universities
discussed the "Telegram" Question, years
ago, no one suggested "paragram."
I've thought much of it since then,
and this is the result in the OUendorfian
Method :—
Has the man telegraphed a telegram?
He has not telegraphed a telegram, but he
has photographed a photogram. The chil-
dren of my neighbour (i.e., my neighbour's
children), paragraphed a paragram. What
do you photograph? I photograph a pho-
togram, but the sisters of the physician
(i.e., the physician's sisters), paragraph a
paragram, &c., &c.

to be sufficient to confute and confound
any infidel, especially if he be a landlord.

[OCTOBER 5, 1878.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
He stoops to " Folly," and rises to the Olympic—A few words on the
approach of Winter, and on some Good Old Times that might
be revived with Advantage to Eeerybody.
WHEN a theatre styles itself The Varieties, or the Vaude-
ville, or the Opera Continue, it ought to act up to its pretensions.
The Alahambra 's full title is, I believe, The Alhambra Theatre of
Varieties, and variety is its charm. There is nothing of the Vaude-
ville at present about the theatre managed by Messrs. JAMES AND
THORNE, but the Opera Comique sticks strictly to its line of business.
The little Charing Cross Theatre, originally intended for such enter-
tainments as those given by Mr. WOODIN, Mr. MACCABE, Lieutenant
COLE, or half a dozen Ethiopian Serenaders, was christened some
three years or so ago " The Folly."
Folly was to be, there, the order of the night. At the 'Folly.
Blue Beard, with Miss LYDIA THOMPSON and Messrs. BROUGH and
EDOUIN, ran some hundred nights. The music was very catching,

the Heathen Chinee was a novelty, and Mr. BBOTOH'S " Thai'« t/w
sort of Man I am" made a hit.
Robinson Crusoe was a dismal failure on the first night; but, after
excision and revision, it had a very long run. It was Folly to have
produced such a piece as Robinson, it was Folly to stick to it, but
Folly won in the end—won, in fact, in the long run.
True to its title, nothing could be greater folly than to produce
two such pieces as La Veuve and L'Eloiln, the one under the name
of The Idol, the other as Stars and Garters.
The subject of The Idol, unless treated, either from an utterly
extravagant, or a most painfully serious point of view, is unpleasant.
A widow idolises her departed husband, has his bust stuck up in
her drawing-room, addresses it as though it were her husband still
living, is gradually disillusioned by his real character being brougb.1
to light, after which the bust is smashed, mended, laughed at, and
placed in somebody else's room.
That there is humour of a certain sort in this notion has been
shown us by Lord LYTTON'S Graves, in Money, who, after per-
petually invoking his "Sainted MARIA," and dwelling upon the
impossibility of his ever finding anyone to fill her place, proposes to
merrv Lady Franklin. But that was only episodical, and very
lightly, very farcically, touched.
In fhe Idol, the worship of the dear defunct is the very essence o:
the play, and a nasty essence too. The piece, treated eccentrically,
might have been vulgarly called Bust Up!
Miss EASTLAKE looks well, dresses well, and plays fairly as Cupia
Erie, and Miss EDITH BLANDE and Miss ROSE CULLEN are briglv
and lively as Mrs. Jekyll and Bessy Jekyll.
Mr. J. G. GHAHAJCE is an honest, hearty, impassioned Captain, in
love with the Widow, but his attentions, at first sight, do not appear
exactly honourable. Mr. LIONEL BROUGH'S is a stupid part. Mr
ALFRED BISHOP extorted from me the one single laugh I indulged in
throughout the performance. His make-up is capital, and hi
ittempt, in the last Act, to address the people who won't listen to
lim, is immensely funny.
The best bit of acting is Mr. PATH/ION'S Jeweller. The scene is
joo long, and, in less clever hands, would be wearisome, but Mr.
'ATJLTON has carefully thought it out point by point, and from first
o last it is a verv good performance. Mr. PAULTON, like Mr. HARE,
akes pains to show us what can be done with a small character-
>art in a good situation, and his Mr. Chisel (a very bad name for
such an honest and delicate-minded tradesman) is unquestionably
he pearl of price in this very bad oyster.
As for Stars and Garters, except a trio, " Going back to Dixie,"
sung by Mr. ALFRED BISHOP, Miss ROSE CULLEN, and Miss ANNIE
POOLE, and some verses and choruses divided between Messrs. BROUOH,
PAULTOW, and a bevy of girls, there is hardly anything to suggest
;he probability of a long run; yet I cannot forget how Robinson
Crusoe was denounced as irredeemably bad, how it was knocked
over, how it picked itself up, and had a really long run of prosperity.
But the Folly is the Folly, be it never so Foolish.
Miss EDITH BLANDE looks magnificent, Miss LTDIA THOMPSON is
as sprightly as ever, and the Pages and Maids of Honour are as
smiling and smirking as Lord OGLE, the oldest habitue in the Stalls,
could wish; but there is a lack of fun, a lack of "go," which in any
other theatre would be fatal to success. The Manager can spell
"Folly," but " Failure" is not in his dictionary. Yet, as the French
Lady remarked on the absence of ennui from the English language,
""Tiat need of the word when they have the thing itself?"
'ing Jiiiijn affords no opportunities for Mr. BROUGH'S genuine
burlesque humour; but I should say the part itself is very different
from, its original, Ouf Premier^, played by little, fat, fussy DATT-
BBAY at the Bouft'es last year. But in Paris L'Etoilc owed its non-
suocess rather to the composer, M. CHABRIER, than to the librettists,
MM. LETERRIER and VANLOO. Odd name, VANLOO! It looks like a
muddled game of cards, something between Van John and Loo. So
much, and enough too, for The Folly; and now for a visit to the
Olympic Orphanage.
Les Deux Orphclinei, by Messrs. D'ENNERY and COEITON, at the
Olympic. What a clever play! in what masterly style is the plot
put together! Yet how needless are the frequent repetitions of the
story told over and over again to the different personages who are
required as links in the chain. With a little extra care the English
adaptation might have had the advantage over the French original
in telling the story with equal lucidity and at less length.
Mr. NEVILLE, who has recently been the Pierre the Convict in
Procif at the Adelphi, is now Pierre, the Cripple, in The Two
Orphans at the Olympic. His performance is admirable. When I
think of the two different figures, Pien-e Lorance, the tall, manly,
honest soldier, in Proof, and Pierre, the Cripple, the poor, helpless
weakling in The Two Orphans, I can scarcely bring myself to
believe they are played by one and the same person, let, there he
is,—the "needy knife-gnnder," at the Olympic, whom "a sense of
wrongs does rouse to vengeance," who turns like the bruised worm,
and, in his final struggle with his big bully of a brother, announces
that it is the case of the sons of ADAH reversed, that it is ABEL who
is going to kill CAIN, and now he is Abel—to do it! What a scene
that last! What a stab! Go it, vou Cripple! What breathless
interest and what delight when the Big Brother Bill—I beg his par-
don, WILLIAM—RIGNOLD, gives his final kick, and expires. But
'tis a melancholy play, sad from beginning to end; no sun-light, no
gleam of relief, not even from the Valet, Picard, whose hard humour
is only aggravating. Nothing can be more pathetic than Miss
MARION TERRY'S Blind Girl, nothing more earnest than Miss EHN-
STONE'S Henriette, nothing more revolting than Mrs. HUNTLEY'S La
Forcharde, nothing more disgustingly repulsive than Mr. WILLIAM
RIGNOLD'S Jacques.
But it is too long, not being over till past twelve. The first part
could be considerably curtailed; a whole nandful could come out of
Tableau IV., one Scene could be entirely eliminated, and at least
three repetitions of the story could be taken for granted. Again,
after the grand climax in the garret, the last Act is not required by
the audience, who would be quite content to take Mr. NEVILLE'S
word for everything ending happily, if he would only step out, and
pleading the lateness of the hour and the earliness of the closing
movement (it is a thirsty piece), assure them that everything would
be settled satisfactorily behind, the curtain. This may be a hint
worth taking. "Our Girls" wouldn't have been an inappropriate
title for Les Deux Orphelines.
The Winter's Tale at Drury, Lane reminds us that Christmas is
coming. More on this head, 1 mean on this Winter's Tale, in my
next.
I hear that the Methodistical Melodrama, Uncle Tom's Cabin, is
drawing unprecedentedly big Pits at the Princess's. I don't care for
this Moody-and-Sankey-panky on the stage, and very little for it
off, and I would rather hear of another Pink Dominos being licensed,
than Niggers, in a theatrical performance, being permitted to sing
such a verse as this,—I quote from memory, but the lines are very
nearly these:—

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"The Devil tempted a woman;
A woman tempted a man;
And, if it hadn't been for the mercy of Heaven,
We 'd all be dead and dam."
Whether in the third line " God" is used instead of " Heaven" I
am not sure, but I think it was when I heard it. And this was
received with a shout of laughter and encored! Well, but where
stop? The Decalogue, or the Lord's Prayer, might be set and sung
in the same way. This verse, certainly, ought to be excised by that
sweet little cherub of a Chamberlain who sits up aloft and keeps
watch for the morals of our theatre-going public.
I have done my theatres for thia week, and now let me sit down in

The account of

excellent institutions, came to grief through want of inherent
ability to reform itself and rectify abuses. But, in the interests of

a visit to a Spa abroad, and it would be a good thing for our young

MOTTO FOR Km BETOSD SEA.—" A little more than Kin, and
less than kind."
"HOW I COULDN'T FIND STANLEY."
(An Indignant Protest addressed to the Editor by the Author of
"How I went for Stanley.")
Snt,—You hinted—nay more than hinted—that, while I was pro-
fessing to find STANLEY, I had never left my native shore, in fact,
had stopped at Margate, or Ramsgate, or wnere the bright shrimp
disports itself in the modest bay of Pegwell. I passed over those
inuendoes with silent contempt.
But you implied that I had undertaken to find STANLEY—nay, that
I had actually styled my admirable work on the subject How I
Found Stanley,—and, in point of fact—the one point which I flatter
myself is always my promontory on the Map of Truth—I had not
found STANLEY at all.
Now, Sir, permit me to state here what is patent to the world, and
no extra charge on the part of the patentee, that I called the first
part of my great and immortal work ,Hou> I went for Stanley," and
that some one in the offite altered that title. I bowed to your
superior judgment—for I am the politest man in the world, and I
often how even without recognising the person to whom I am bowing
—and in my laconic and Wellingtonian manner, I exclaimed " Stet"
and it stetted.
So you see, Sir, I had only undertaken to " go for" STANLEY, and
for STANLEY I went.
Now observe. Was I the only man after STANLEY? STANLEY
first, the rest nowhere. There was another indefatigable explorer
who, assisted by means,—which, from no fault of my own, I could
not command,—had got on the track, had taken the shortest and
most expensive route, and while I was, heaven only knows where,
in the Keep-It-Dark Country, risking my life for an idea, and
sending you imploring letters for aid, even if it took the form of
postage stamps, This Gentleman, of French extraction, I imagine
by his name, had got the right STANLEY by the ear.
Why couldn't I find STANLEY? Because Mr. D'OYLY CAETE had
got him! He had hidden him away, he had secreted him, and for
aught we know, as Mr. D'OYLY CAETE is the Manager of the Opera
Comique, he may be utilising his newly acquired available talent on
board H.M.S. Pinafore, where it may be that Mr. H. M. S-TANLEY
is disguised as a sailor, and nightly joining in the GILBEET-CTUI-
STJLLIVAN chorus of " He is an Englishman.
"For he himself has said it,
And ' tis greatly to his credit,
He it an Englishman!"
And how do I arrive at this? Thus: In the Era I find a para-
gram which I present to you as my justification:—
"Mr. E. D'OYLY CARTE, with characteristic energy, haa arranged with the
world-renowned explorer of Africa, Mr. HENRY M. STANLEY, to giro a series
of one hundred lectures this autumn in the principal towns of Great Britain.
The lecture will bo called 'Through the Dark Continent," and will be, in
fact, a narrative of Mr. STANLEY'S last journey through Africa."
Good. And where shall / be meantime? My panorama will be
ready, my speaking likenesses will be in working order, and I 've
engaged a double-handed brass band, and a double-headed trumpet
blower, who will be heard for miles round. I shall be all there when
the bell rings. There will be a portrait, in oils, of myself, outside,
described as a D' Oily Carte de Visite, and my solicitor informs me
that this, in his opinion (up to Six-and-Eightpence), is not a
"Colourable Imitation," being already coloured.
I shall take two blacks who will help to "make" one white (my-
self) with a set of bones and banjones.
Banjones is accusative plural of Banjo. Observe, extract from the
Dark Continent Grammar, page 5. Black Letter Copy:—
Nom. Banjo.
Gen. Banjonis.
Dat. Banjoul.
Nom. Banjones.
Gen. Banjonum.
Dat. Banjonibus.
Singular.
Ace. Banjonem.
roc. Banj-0:%*
Abl. Banjone.
Plural.
Ace. Banjones (or Burn-Jones).
Foe. (Wanting, or Oicing-Jones.)
Abl. Banjonibus.
However, I 'm not going to give you the result of all my hard work
and study gratis, so " if you want any more you may sing it your-
self," And I am yours with dignity,
THE Ex-Ex- (on DOUBLE EX)-PLOBER OF THE
"KEEP-IT-DAEK CONTINENT."
P.S.—I have no objection to throw in the information that
once on a time" I did find STANLEY in Paris.
"How did I find him?"
I found him very well, thank you, and how are you?

THE SHADOW ON THE HILLS.
READY!
So rings the "Watchword o'er the Western border.
And India, arms at hand, and well in order,
Stands still, attent, and steady,
Watching—what f Scarce the Wolf, whose snarl of wrath
Affronts and would arrest her on her path;
Nor the red sun-glare on the glittering snow
That crowns the summits of the Sufeid Koh;
But a dim Shadow, vaguely vast, which creeps
Across the craggy steeps.
Seared at a Shadow? Nay, she is not scared,
Nor menacing; hut vigilant, prepared.
She need not fear, nor need she rashly flaunt,
Her hand in reach of the aye-ready steel,
The Lion at her heel,
A tutelary warder none may daunt.
But watch she must, and strike, if need arise.
Empress of realms beneath those Orient skies,
Where rumour shakes allegiance as the wind
Rustles dry reeds, and gossip can unbind
The bonds of generations. She too knows
That Nemesis of Conquest which forbids
The Conqueror at will to close
The circle of his dominating sweep,
Whilst rivals creep and creep,
Like Shadows first, then in more solid guise,
Nearer his holds, as to dispute the prize.
So India wakes, and watches, not again
Amidst those iron hills to stand at check,
Or fall in seeming wreck
liack from the ambushed Afghan's bullet-rain.
Not as inviting strife, but in defence,
Checkmating craft and curbing insolence,
Or overt or occult;
For they who dare insult
The Indian Una, dreaming, it may be,
The Lion sleeps or strays, right soon must see
The dusky Virgin is awake and armed,
Her champion alert and unalarmed.
No time for too close question of the past,
Of too imwary steps too hot retracing:
The Shadow o'er yon western hill-tops cast
May pass like other shades, but India, bracing
Her strength against all chances, firm and steady,
Must pass the Watchword—" Keady!"
CASTS OF "CHARACTERS."
PROFESSOR PUNCH,
ENCOURAGEMENT of Research is certainly not one amongst
the duties of the Home Office. The contrary, indeed, appears to be
its policy, if not its function, from the conclusion of a letter addressed
from that Department to a Gentleman who had complained of not
having been permitted to take a cast of the head of a recently
executed convict:—
"I am to add that Mr. CROSS has thought it advisable to give directions
that the practice of allowing casts to be taken of the heads of condemned
criminals should be discontinued.—A. J. 0. LIDDELL."
Why, Mr. Punch, when the casts are not taken till after death?
Was there ever any objectionable sale for the casts of criminals'
heads, regarded as objects of morbid interest? Or is it possible that
Mr. CROSS considers the truth of Phrenology so completely demon-
strated in every particular that there is no necessity whatever for
any more study of the relation between the mental character and
the form of the head? Can he be quite satisfied that on that point
there is nothing more left to be ascertained by the student of Science
through observations conducted on the lines laid down by Lord
BACON? Surely the 11 O.MI-; SECRETARY cannot confound BACON with
GAMMON.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A MISTAKE.
Old Lady (emwying vfrathfully from Cabmen's Shelter}. "I SAT,
CONDUCTOR! IF YOU DON'T SEND THIS 'ERE TRAM ON DIRECTLY, I 'LL
REPORT YOU! ARF A HOUR I 'VE BEES SF.TTIN' A-WAITIN' A'RBADY.
AIN'T YOU ASHAMED OF YOURSELF?"
HIBERNIAN MAEVELS.
WOXDEBS will never cease, Mr. Punch.
The Mayo Examiner quotes from the Rosary Magazine a remark-
able illustration, related by an Irish Dominican Father, of the
"Efficacy of the Water of Lourdes "—a case of confirmed dipsomania
completely cured. The patient was a man of respectable position
but intemperate habits: he had been a drunkard for years. The
Father invited him to take the pledge. He said he had taken it
often before, but had never kept it two days, and was convinced
that if he then took it he should break it again. In the meantime,
the Father, having "put him on his knees," produced "a small
bottle of water from the fountain of Lourdes." The rest is in his
Reverence's own words :—
'• I gave him the small bottle, and told him while yet on his knees to say a
Hail Mary and take one drop of the water. He did so, and upon the instant
he said he was convinced that with the protection of the Blessed Virgin he
•would keep the pledge. He was at the time in a s-huttwed state of constitu-
tion from drink. He went home, and in the course of1 ten days he wrote to
me in good spirits, saying he had kept hia pledge, and was quite strong. He
paid me a visit last week; he was the picture of health and happiness, and
said that from the moment he tasted the water he had lost all thirst for
stimulants."
Wonderful, if true—isn't it? But if this wonder he a truth indeed,
the experiment above-narrated deserves repetition. Might not Car-
dinal MANNING possibly find Lourdes water a most potent aid to his
valuable exertions in the cause of temperance? Could he point to its
general and ordinary, not to say invariable, success in the treatment
of dipsomania, what a triumph that would be for his own Temperance
Society over that of the Church of England and every other—eh,
Mr. Punch 1
Suppose, Sir, that a drop of Lourdes water, taken under prescribed
conditions, is really an infallible remedy for the disease of taking a
drop too much. If so, one small bottle of that water would suffice to
wean multitudes from the bottle—of whiskey or gin. The water of
Lourdes would preclude the Permissive Bill, and be worth all the
Good Templars, the Band of Hope, the United Kingdom Alliance,
with Sir WILFKID LAWSON and his best jokes, into the bargain.
The Lourdes water cure, no doubt, would be a perfect preventive as
well as cure of drunkenness.
Besides, if Lourdes water is a specific for dipsomania, must it not
be an equally certain cure for every other disease or injury, surgical
as well as medical? A miracle is a miracle. Arc not all miracles
Equally possible? No panacea can equal a genuine catholicon,
which would supersede both pills and ointment too. If Lourdes
water were sucn, the chorus of a popular dithyrambic might be
teetotally turned to:—
"Lourdes' cures the gout, the colic, and the phthisic;
And it is believed to be the very best of physic."
Lourdes water might also be a general prophylactic. Ought it not
to act as a never-failing substitute for vaccine lymph?
Another Irish paper also reports a fact which the Rev. FREDEEICK
LEE, of All Saints, Lambeth, can, if he pleases, introduce into his
next edition of Glimpses of the Supernatural. Old AUBREY him-
self could not have more concisely and coolly chronicled an instance
of a rerenant than the Tuam News clearly has, thus :—
"THE LATE MOST REV. DR. OLIVER KELLY, ARCHBISHOP OF TUASI.
—A solemn High Mass de requiem was celebrated at the cathedral, Tiinm, on
Monday last, for the soul of Most Eev. Dr. KELLY. HU Grace the Arch-
bishop was present."
Don't you think that the " manifestation " above recorded might
be hopefully investigated by the British National Association of
Spiritualists? We may be sure that it would engage their attention
to as much purpose as any similar inquiry they have as yet pursued
has resulted in. Both of the above stories, particularly the latter,
are quite iu their way, as well, Sir, as in yours, and in that of a
philosopher with such a capacity of swallow as GOBGIAS.
THE NEW POLICY.
(Or, what ought to have come of it,—if there hadn't been a hitch
somewhere.)

ham ware, teapots, moderators, opera-hats, and bicyclts in a heap

you know—the Kaiser-i-Hind, the mighty Empress. And here—
here 's a letter for you! [Hands him a despatch.

satisfied old Ameer! Oh, this is too gracious—too kind! But read
it to him, my son; for he has never learned reading, writing—nor,
indeed, he may add, arithmetic! His education has been sadlv-
neglected—sadly. But Allah be praised for that! Allah be praised
for that!
Sir Neville. Quite so. Well, this is about it. (Opens a despatch.)
YOU see, Lilian's latest idea is to make things hot, and get up a
row all round—somehow. He's stirring up the feudatories down
South fairly now, and we calculate that that move will be tolerably

more than one tough job on hand, we have thought it as well, hearing
that you are a dangerous old savage, to drag you in—neck and heels.
You see you are cut ofi from us completely by an almost impassable

this won't do, you know—it doesn't hit off the new policy. So, all
you 've got to manage is this. Bend ABRAHOFF and his set flying
back to St. Petersburg; and if that doesn't bring a Cossack horde
over your borders,—well, take a dip over them North yourself, and
see if you can't stir up a row that way. Meanwhile, all we want
to do is to ride rough-shod over the place, depose you, you know, if
necessary, and, in short, arrange everything with a view to a brisk
universal Asiatic blow-up before—let's say, next spring.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JACK SPRATTS.
A Talc of Modern Art and Fashion.
PART V.
BUT, in spite of the honour and glory, JACK SPRATT found out,
after a while, that he did not relish fashionable society -with quite so
keen a zest as at first.
He could neither dance, nor flirt, nor play cards. Of sport, the
turf, and politics he knew nothing whatever, and cared as little for
such topics as the gorgeous gilded glittering Swells cared for old
music, old poets, and old pictures, which were his favourite themes,
and on which he would descant most eloquently, and at great
length, if anybody gave him a chance. The G. G. G. Swells never
gave him a chance ii they could help it. good-natured as they gene-
rally are. And it was borne upon ] him, in due time, that the
illustrious representatives of
Science, Literature, and Art
did not come into the hollow
world to talk or listen to the
likes of him, nor even to each
other, for the matter of that, but
to practise repartee with noble
Lords, and to instruct and
amuse fine Ladies, which is
capital good fun.
JACK SPRATT had no repartee,
and loathed f un • and although
he could talk to fine Ladies with
eager fluency, his talk was all
instruction and no amusement,
as the fine Ladies very soon
found out; and for Ladies that
were not fine he did not profess
to care.
In addition to which, the more
he saw of fashionable society
the less he thought of it; for he
not only met there Artists like
himself, but caricaturists, and
comic singers, and play-actors,
and such-like folk, for whom he
had an almost unbounded con-
tempt; and these people seemed
to get on better with the fine
Ladies than he did.
So he got into a habit of
hanging about, and standing in
people's way, and being jostled
out of it, and would listlessly
lean against walls and doors,
and gaze by the hour at the
mother of his twins (who used
to think dancing so immodest),
as she floated languidly by to
the enervating measures of the
Manolo Valse, rocked in the
close embrace of some well-
seasoned hero, of martial or
diplomatic air, who never
seemed to tire of his lovely
burden; while her supple form,
in its close - fitting sheeny
sheath, would lend itself, as if
by instinct, to all the witching
undulations of the passionate "Lurch'1 of v Liverpool," or Boston's
suggestive " dip."
Then rousing herself, as thejstrain would3 change, she would
plunge headlong, supported by a fresh partner, into the stormy
vortex of the polka, with a dishevelled recklessness even more
seductive than her former dreamy and voluptuous abandon.
Or else in scented conservatories (discreetly dim), continental
Princes with ardent exotic eyes, or foreign Ambassadors with tro-
pical turns of speech, or polygamous Eastern potentates, with pearls
and diamonds loose in their waistcoat pockets, would sit at her feet
and ply her with the charm of their insidious conversation, while
she fanned herself languidly, and drooped her sable lashes.
Or in the glare of crowded supper-rooms, bold, facetious Conserva-
tive Statesmen, or nice but naughty old Dukes, ribboned and starred
and gartered so that there could be no mistake about them (which was
always very pleasing to Mrs. SPRATT—and small blame to her), would
lounge over her alabaster shoulders, and whisper into her pretty
little pink ear; they did not pour State secrets into that shell-like
organ, but very straightforward compliments, or racy jokes, or
risky little personal anecdotes about exalted houses, to the washing

of whose family linen very few female Spratte are admitted in this
nice, flattering, confidential way.
Fortunately, perhaps, absorbed as she now always was in the con-
templation ot her own peerless charms, she had contracted a habit
of never listening to anecdotes of any kind, or jokes either; but she
would reply to jokes, compliments, and risky little anecdotes alike
with the same enchanting laugh, that had more music than meaning
in its ring; and this got the poor dear a reputation for being the
reverse of prudish, which made her more popular than ever with, the
more elderlv of her admirers; so that really clever, but rather plain
women of the world, who made up for their want of beauty by their
complete freedom from prudishness, were literally nowhere,
Mrs. SPBATT'S powers of conversation, never very brilliant, had
been quite extinguished by her
rise in the social scale. She
was evidently made to be looked
at—not to talk or listen. And
yet. although there were many
Ladies of high rank, quite as
good to look at as she, and even
more so, and who wore their
dresses as low in the back, and
as small in the waist, and as
tight round the legs, and who,
moreover, could both talk and
listen delightfully to young or
old, however frivolous, when it
was worth their while; these
were one and all deserted for
Mrs. SPRATT, and left to waste
their fragrance on the desert
air, and talk and listen to each
other. (Not to mention fresh,
blooming, beautiful young girls,
only just out, and about whom
Mr. Punch will not trust him-
self to write, he being so very
susceptible.)
For not to be seen familiarly
talking and listening to Mrs.
SPRATT, or rather pretending to
do so, was to be " out of it.
And of all the men in that
fashionable world, not one ap-
peared more hopelessly " out of
it" than JACK SPRATT; and in
all society there was nobody left
for him to listen and talk to but
himself.
Even he grew to perceive this
in time!
He also grew to perceive that
late hours interfere with work,
and Mrs. SPRATT had to go into
the hollow world alone. Sad-
dle-horses were brought round
for her in the morning, broug-
hams or victorias (according to
the weather) in the afternoon,
and in the evening there were
dinners and dances, and bright
little suppers in the small hours
of the night, to which she could very well go without him.
For there was always at hand some smart unprejudiced woman of
fashion, only too proud to chaperone the famous Mrs. SPRATT, and
who could keep always in sight, and out of hearing, and all that,
just as well as the most innocently complacent of husbands.
He was not missed, and there was plenty for him to do at home,
besides painting. There were the little red books of the butcher and
baker to look after, and the lists to make out for the Civil Service
Supply Association, and so forth; and ;then there were the twins.
He had occasionally to take them out into the flowery meads himself
—perambulator and all—and even sometimes to bath them at night,
and teach them to say their prayers, and put them to bye-bye. For
the nurse, a warmhearted, but vain and extremely pretty woman in
her humble way, was almost as fond of late hours and congenial
society as her mistress, and much as she loved the pretty little dar-
lings, who doated on her in return, she would sometimes yield to
temptation, and leave them for gayer scenes.
They also doated, but in a distant and awestruck manner, on their
mother, whom they very seldom saw, and then always in some new
i splendour of attire.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
With unwashed faces and hands, in grimy little cotton frocks, and rice-milky bibs (every-
body knows that the bib should.be removed immediately after meals, and the pinafore resume
its sway), they would patiently wait at the street-door, till they were rewarded by the sight
of her, sweeping down the stairs and through the hall in her silks and muslins and laces;
and before they could have said " Jack Spratt!" she was whisked away, telling them to be
good, and kissing her daintily-gloved finger-tips to them, and showing her beautiful white
teeth; and they would stare after her through the dust with wistful adoration.

Sometimes an organ would be playing a popular melody, such as " Tommy, make roam,"
or "Don't^make a noise" (which are not so bad when you don't know the words), and,
excited by the pretty tune, they would pretend that the dust was a golden cloud, and the
brougham or victoria a fiery chariot, and their mother a being made up of a fairy, a queen,
an angel, a saint, and a goddess, going straight off to heaven in a mist of glory; till the
nurse would come and box their ears for standing in the draught, for her love was tempered
with a wise seyeritv.
At other times Viscounts and Guardsmen would call, and smoke their cigarettes in the
pretty front parlour (Mrs. SPRATT had never allowed the trusty friends to smoke when she
was by, even in the open air); and the twins had to be kept out of sight, because thev had
holes in their socks, may be, and were not lit to be seen. And when the Guardsmen
and Viscounts had taken their departure, and the little darlings hurried down-stairs to get
a glimpse of their "lovely Mamma," she would tell them they were a perfect disgrace, and
pack them off. crying, to bed; and quench the longings of her maternal heart by nursing a
pair of Pugs, the gift of His Grace the Duke of PENTONVTLLE.
Female finery is very costly nowadays, and has to be paid for. Think of JACK SPRATT,
in the intervals of his domestic duties, painting against time, and wasting all that eagle-
winged genius of his on pot-boilers, to pay for his wife's gorgeous apparel!
All his pictures represent pretty sock-darners, for it was the sock-darning and the pretty
face, and nothing else, that had so touched the great heart of the British public in his first
exhibited work; so he turns them out by the dozen in every variety of size, costume,
attitude, and complexion. But the hired models he has to employ, and the lay-figure he
has to fall back upon when these cannot be got, have not the face and form of Mrs. SPRATT;
and all his sock-darners are inferior to that first one, and each sock-darner inferior to the
last; so that a time must inevitably come when the great dealers will give him good advice
instead of commissions, and finally cease to darken his doors, and he will have to darken theirs
instead.
"A weary chase, a wasted hour!"
Be warned in time, ye rising young geniuses! Let no consideration tempt you into
painting for filthy lucre, till you have realised a handsome independence by patient and
steady devotion to Art for its own sweet sake!

ANGELINA ON HER TRAVELS.
MY OWN DEAREST BLANCHE,
IN spite of ray promise to write to you twice a day from the moment of
my leaving London for the Continent, in company with EDWIN, to the hour of
my return, I have really found it utterly impossible to send you a single line,
although we have been away now very nearly six weeks. The fact is, we have
been so busy that we have had time for nothing. As it is now raining heavily,
and EDWIN is fast asleep, I will devote my unusual leisure to telling you where
we have been, what we nave seen, and what we have been doing. As you have
never been out of England, my love, I am sure you will be amused, and I think
I may really add, instructed by my descriptions.
We had a most fortunate passage over. You know EDWIN is a barrister,
and has to defend all sorts of dreadful people at the Old Bailey. He says that
the thieves on board evidently recognised him as a " friend in need," and conse-
quently allowed our boxes and impedimenta (Eowipr gave me that word) to
escape molestation. Be this as it may, we certainly lost nothing—not even a
watch. Were we not lucky?
Nothing of importance occurred on our road to Paris until we reached
Amiens. The train stopped for ten minutes there, and we got such very nice
mashed potatoes at the Buffet. I shall never forget them.
1 am sure you would like Paris. Such a beautiful place! Such shops!
There is one establishment on the other side of the water just like that large
place in Westbourne Grove. I got some very nice mittens there, which Vou
shall see on our return. We went to the Exhibition, too. It was rather
amusing, hut we came across such a number of badly-dressed people that it
was quite a relief to get away from it.
Having now described Paris. I will tell you what we did next. We went
to Switzerland. 1 was just the least bit disappointed with it. The country is
very hilly, and rather damp. I found some trouble in walking (you know
I am fond of high heels), and my feathers came wofully out of curl. Leaving
these drawbacks out of the question, the place was rather nice. We got a
very good Uible-iVhute at Lucerne, and there was a capital band at Ouchy.
EDWIN talked about staying a couple of nights at a hotel on the top of the Kighi.
At the last moment he found that the place was bankrupt, and said that, on the
whole, the company of a man in possession of a cloud-
capped mountain might possibly produce a feeling of
dulness. I was so glad when he gave up the scheme.
I hate climbing. Not that there is much climbing on the
Riglii. You go up in a railway. But a railway is not as
comfortable as a lift.
Having now told you all about Switzerland, I pass on to
Italy. We thought it rather pleasant, although we could
not find any respectable wine but Marsala. At Florence
we came across an excellent English chemist's shop,
where we found we could get the bost Bond Street per-
fumes. There were some pretty pictures, too, at one
of the Fine Art Galleries. Of course we went to Rome,
and saw everything. EDWIN was very pleased with the
place, as he ascertained that he could buy the Times and
the other English newspapers at a library just opposite
our hotel. We went to Slilan, too, and saw the Cathedral.
It was verv nice, and reminded me rather of St. An-
drew's, Wells Street. Of course we "did" A'cniee. It
is rather difficult to describe. However, imagine what
the effect would be were they to build stone houses on
either side of the Regent's Canal, and you will get some
notion of the sort of thing. We got some good ices at
FLORIAX'S. The table-d'hutc at the Europa was certainly
above the average.
Having now told you all about Italy, I will finish my
letter by giving you a few rough notes from my Diary
of other places we visited. As you one day may also
take (J tour, you may really find them very useful:—
Anticerp.—The plnce where REt'HKf invented his hat.
Patterns are to be found in the picture galleries.
Brwaeh.—The capital of Belgium, and a good place
for buying boots.
Co/dyne.—You can get genuine Eau de Cologne here,
but you will find it a bore to carry home.
Dieppe.—A place where they dress three times a day.
There is some sea in the neighbourhood, which is used in
fine weather for the display of bathing costumes.
Genera.—On a tine morning you can see Mont Blanc
from the window of your hotel. Rather pretty watches.
Heidelburg.—Mind you don't go up to the Castle—
it's awfully fatiguing.
Madrid.—Really much better hotels than might be
expected.
Naples.—Rather nice. Vesuvius pretty.
Padua.—Interesting, if you are fond of that sort of
thing.
Pompeii.—Sweet.
Wiesbaden.—Rather dull since they have put a stop
to the gambling.
There! I think I have written you quite enough:
and as EDWIN is awake, and it has ceased raining, I
must bring my letter to a conclusion. However, my
own darling, I am sure you will readily own that there
is nothing like foreign travel for improving the mind.
Good-bye, and write soon. That's a dear, tell me all
the news—I mean what you are all wearing. Ah!
there's EDWIN calling for me! Once more, good-bye.
Your ever affectionate friend,
Tuesday. ANGELINA..
P.S.—I don't send any address, as we are always on
the move. Don't forget to write.
To His Grace the Duke of Bedford.
(Addressed by respectable Co-cent Gardeners and thereabouts.)
WE beg your pardon, but grant, your Grace,
One favour. Do alter this filthy place
Called Covent Garden—our neighbourhood's curse;
We assure you 'tis getting worse and worse.
'Tis loathsome by day, and noisome by night.
And a word from your Grace would set it right.

But now 'tis to London a thorough disgrace.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

SABBATARIAN SIMILITUDE.
VENERABLE ME.
PUNCH,
ONE of the
late sittings of the
Chureh Congress
at Sheffield was
devoted to a sub-
ject on which you,
Sir, had the as-
sembly been ho-
noured with your
presence, might
have instructed it
by your remarks.
Their Rever-
ences discussed,
on that occasion,
"The attitude of
the Church to-
wards Popular
Literature and
Recreations."
That, as regards
most literature, and most reoreations,Jof a popular character, appears
to be'the same as'the' relative position in which a Ritualist Clergy-
man, whilst officiating, stands before the People to whose admiration
he presents his embroidered shoulders. On those recreations and
that literature, for the greater part, the Church turns its back.
You, Sir, would perhaps have had something new to say concern-
ing topics upon which you are so highly qualified to speak. _As it
was, nobody added much, if anything, to the stock of existing
information.
But one speaker, the Rev. C. BULLOCK, is reported to hare dis-
tinguished himself by a metaphor more original than correct :—
"Passing on to the question of popular recreation in connection with Sun-
day observance, Mr. BULLOCK said that no one could be more alive than he
was to the evil which, was wrought morally as well at religiously, by the open
public-house on the Lord's Day. But to meet that evil, as was proposed by
some, by what was termed the counter-attraction of the museum, the picture
gallery, the aquarium, or the theatre, would, as far aa he could see, be to
adopt a very bad form of homoeopathic treatment."
Of course, Mr. Punch, the Reverend Gentleman knew the principle
on which honweopathy is founded to be similia similibut curantur.
Picture galleries, therefore, museums, aquariums, and theatres, he
must regard as things of a like nature with public-houses. Per-
haps, then, he further considers paintings, sculptures, objects of
natural history, and dramatic entertainments similar, in moral, if
not in physical effect, to intoxicating liquors.
It has not, perhaps, been as generally remarked as it might have
been that, when the Rev. Mr. BULLOCK likened, by implication,
things so very different from one another as intellectual amuse-
ments and animal indulgence—Bos locutus eit. Bos, let us say
atque Sacerdos—omitting, of course, the examples in the Latin
Grammar which stand between Bos and Sacerdos. Not that 1 take
Bos to be specifically a sacerdotalist; but, as an expositor of the
common clerical mind, he decidedly speaks very much more like a
Priest than A LiTMAH.
P.S.—Is it not remarkable that in the animadversions on the Stage
delivered by several of the assembled divines, there was no reference
whatever made to performances like those going on at St. Alban's,
Holborn?

THE following letters have been sent to 85, Fleet Street. Mr.
Punch cannot help thinking that they all (with the exception of
the last) must have been intended for the columns of his contem-
poraries :—
Sicord and Fire Club, Pall Mall.
Snt,—Why hasn't Lord LYTTON been hanged? Were good Queen
BESS still amongst us, the Viceroy would have been drawn and
quartered long before this. What, Sir! Allow a miserable Blacka-
moor to insult us! Permit a cowardly nigger to snap his fingers in
the face of the British Lion! Sir, it is shameful! Sir, it is scanda-
lous! I can hardly write for indignation!
I tell you what we should have done, Sir. The moment our Envoy
was sent back, we ought to have marched a hundred thousand men
into the heart of Afghanistan. You want to know how we should
have done this? Stuff, Sir, stuff! You don't know what you are
talking about! The British Soldier can do anything—anything, Sir!
I tell you what, Sir, our Indian Empire is a thing of the past!
Yours indignantly,
(Signed) HERCULES BOMBSHELL,
Lieut.-General (Retired List).
Noodles' Club, St. James's Street.
SIR,—I do not wish to use strong language, but I cannot help
asking why hasn't Lord LYTTON been hanged? In the days of
Queen ELIZABETH the question would have been unnecessary. Her
Majesty knew how to deal with blundering Statesmen.
Sir, I fear the harm done by the Viceroy is past remedy. A
friendly and enlightened chieftain has been needlessly outraged.
The British Lion has snubbed one of his best and firmest allies. It
is really too bad—a great deal too bad!
Of course this unfortunate Mission ought never to have been
despatched. There is no doubt about that. And when SHEW: Au
expressed his just indignation, instead of sending soldiers to the
front, the Viceroy should have telegraphed apologies. Sir, from the
first to the last our relations with Afghanistan have been a profound
mistake. I do not wish to take too melancholy a view of the matter,
but I cannot help feeling that our Indian Empire is a thing of the
past. Yours sorrowfully,
(Signed) COB DEN PEECE,
(Late Bengal Civil Service).
Junior Sword and Fire Club, Pall Mall.
SIR,—The Viceroy deserves the thanks of every true Englishman
for his very spirited conduct in this matter of Afghanistan. The
question is, what should be done next P I know the country very
well. I have read all the military books dealing with the subject
for the last twenty years, although I have never strayed beyond
Gibraltar. You will see that I am an excellent authority upon the
subject.
Well, Sir, after due deliberation I am convinced that we should
finish the war long before the snows of winter begin to accumulate.
It will be easy enough, Sir, to manage a peace Defore Christmas.
All we have to do is to march immediately to the frontier.
Yours confidently,
(Signed) CHABLES SHAKO,
Sub-Lieut. 142nd Regt. Line.
Woolwich.
SIB,—We ought to be very much obliged to Lord LYTTON for
having brought this unpleasant matter in Afghanistan to so satis-
factory a conclusion. We have now to consider what should be done
next. From my childhood I have made the geography of Asia a
favourite study. From this you will see that I can really speak
with some authority upon the subject.
I have thought the matter carefully out, and I am convinced that
masterly inactivity should be the order of the day. It really would
be sheer insanity to force our troops into a country simply impassable
in the bitter cold of winter. Prepare as much as you please, but do
not move a step until April, May, or June. Were it asked, such
would he my advice to Lord LYTTON.
Yours confidently,
(Signed) CHARLES BUSBY,
Sub-Lieut. Royal Artillery.
85, Fleet Street.
MASTER,—Don't you think the request " not to speak to the man
at the wheel" might be extended to the men at the wheel of State?
The Afghans have a proverb which we have annexed without appre-
ciating. I mean the proverb which has the English equivalent,
"Speech is silver, but silence is golden."
Yours thoughtfully,

attribute the fact in a great measure to want of sufficient nourishment, arising
from inability to obtain food through the serious depression of trade."
The hungry, says Mr. BUMBLE, might obtain food enough to sup-
port life in the Workhouse, if they would enter it, but they prefer to
starve. This effect of the Poor-law our Beadle considers not alto-
gether so satisfactory as could be wished. Persons starved to death
are, indeed, provided for with a shovel, at the cheapest possible rate,
but it does not therefore follow that rates are saved, since many
destitute parents die and leave families of children behind them, for
whom there is no choice between starvation and in-door relief.
Such is the Law, remarks Mr. BUMBLE; but then we all know what
the Law is. The Law, however, being such, precludes a suggestion
which he would otherwise submit to the Social Science Congress;
namely, that, in conformity with the principles of Parochial
Economy, the Legislature should, in cases of extreme distress,
legalise suicide. ___

M.RS. SPRATT'S bed was not all roses neither. Smart people have
at times a very provoking way with them. One day they are quite
playful and iamiliar. The next, when we would be playful and
familiar in our turn, with all the world looking on, they will pub-
licly ignore us through a double eyeglass, to our great discomfiture,
as we would naturally like to pass before the world for being their
bosom friends.
That is, if we are SPRATTS.
And then they keep us in such tortures of suspense! either forget-
ting to bid us to the feast our Spratty souls are hungering for, or
else inviting us, as by an afterthought, at the eleventh hour, when
we feel puzzled as to whether we had better be Sprattishly dignified,
and decline with thanks, or put our prides in our pockets and go;
and if we go, it is ten to one they will look as if they wondered what
the deuce we are doing there; and if we don't, they never perceive
our absence, and we are none the better in their eyes for the self-
respect that has cost us so much self-denial. 0 we Spratts!
Also, it must be owned that Mrs. SPRATT'S beauty, and the very
ample justice that was done to it both by herself and by the gorgeous
Swells, did not greatly recommend that lady to the glittering
Swellesses; so that she often met with cruel snubs and haunting
slights from Ladies less beautiful, but of infinitely greater social
importance than herself.
And she had not yet learnt how to dissemble when thus aggrieved,
and swallow it all, and pretend she had not perceived it; nor could
she yet toady the great of her own sex, and kiss the cruel hands that
scratched her, and disarm such social tyranny by penitent, humble
ways, without which arts no too pretty woman of her degree can
appear to hold her own in the hollow world of fashion; nor had she,
on the other hand, that mixture of thick-skinned impudence with
ready mother-wit, which sometimes makes the merest parcenue a
match for all the dowagers in England, and a thorn in their noble
sides for ever; so that they give ner a wide berth, and revenge
themselves by telling each other that she is not a lady, and asking
each other what they can expect.
Poor Mrs. SPRATT! She couldn't very well put out her tongue,
and say " Yah!"
In after-moments of heartburning that came of such treatment,
Mrs. SPHATT would fold her"children to her wounded bosom, and rail
at the hollow world, and rave of love and peace and the homely do-
mestic hearth, and the good old days of " Catscradle" and " Puss in
the Corner," and the long-lost trusty friends, and the good old great-
grandpapa; and, wildly calling for socks, she would darn them with
any worsted that came to hand, the salt tears in her lovely eves, a
twin on each knee, and her clever JACK'S protecting arm around her •
and suddenly the postman would knock, and the Duchess's belated
post-card arrive, just in time; and then, with jumps of joy, and
trills of triumph, and a general scattering of socks, twins, worsted,
and everything else to the four winds, up-stairs to dress, and
away, away to the hollow world again!
And there, such snubs as she met with, she would try to pass on
to others; for even in the most exclusive saloons she would occa-
sionally have to encounter people whose presence there was an
offence to her. For instance, wives and daughters of Science, Litera-
ture, and Art; actresses of high repute ; eminent female physicians;
great female philanthropists; poetesses, paintresses, authoresses,
sculptoresses, and what not: worse than all, ladies whose only
claim to distinction lay in their good looks and pretty manners.
Against all such upstart intruders of her own sex she would level
her double eyeglass with happily copied impertinence. For just as
those who rise from the ranks learn how to command by having first
learnt how to obey, Mrs. SPRATT had learnt how to snub by having
been well and frequently snubbed herself. Fortunately for her
victims, and unfortunately for her, she did not bear the Queen's
commission, so to speak, and had no rank as yet beyond that which
is conferred by the possession of a pretty face; so that her snubbings
were of no account, and, consequently, recoiled on herself; for a
premeditated snub which nobody feels," is almost as bad for its per-
petrator as a premeditated joke that nobody laughs at.
Indeed, these harmless little airs and graces of Mrs. SPRATT'S were
all set down to the fact that her late papa had been in the oil and
Italian trade; which was very uncharitable and unjust, for they were
only imitations of such airs and graces as she had seen many a real
fine lady give herself any day; and very good imitations, too.
But one person may steal a horse, as we all know, while another
must not even look at the stable-door.
And thus, snubbing and being snubbed, dressing and dancing and
feasting and flirting, did she soar higher and higher in her butterfly

career, and, in spite of the disadvantage of her oily origin, she
achieved a social success which even transcended in its glory that
of the better-born beauties, her predecessors on the throne of
Fashion, whose features are so familiar to us all, and about whose
doings, and careerings, and dressings, and so forth, we hear so much
through the fashionable prints.
Indeed, all Mrs. SPEATT'S movements, where she went, what she
wore, and how she looked in it, were duly chronicled for us week by
week, and our mouths would water as we read how "Mrs. SPRATT
honoured a small-and-early at Marlborough House with her pre-
sence," or " was graciously pleased to attend the State.Ball at Buck-
ingham Palace," &c., &c., <Xc.
Her portraits appeared in all the illustrated papers down to the
Polict News, and was printed on pocket-handkerchiefs, and stamped
on fusee-boxes and cigar-cases, and cut out in gingerbread at coun-
try fairs; and her photographs, in every size, in every attitude, in
every variety of dress and want of dress, were exhibited in the
shop-windows, along with those of rival beauties of the world which
has no English name. They were at all prices—from a shilling
upwards; a reduction made on taking a quantity. So that even
'ARRY, who is as partial to lovely woman as nis betters, could afford
to hang her up, framed and glazed, in his humble abode, and re-
create his soul by the contemplation of her peerless charms through
a magnifying glass, and descant thereon with his pals, and make
comparisons, in his knowing; way, between her and other beauties
of his collection, and have a real good time.
And, much as he dislikes 'ARRY, Mr. Punch is bound to admit
that in this particular instance poor 'ARRY showed rather to advan-
tage, and was really more chivalrous, delicate, and romantic in his
imaginary delectations than were the gorgeous, gilded, glittering
Swells—possibly because he gazed on those peerless charms from
below, as on some bright particular star.
But we will leave the erotic 'ARRY, and return to Mrs. SPIUTT,
who, wherever she went, was so mobbed that you might have taken
her for an accident, or a row, or a fit^ or a pickpocket caught in the
act, instead of a pretty woman! She was even mobbed by titled
crowds at royal and ducal garden-parties, where a couple of police-
men were always retained to make a way for her to the strawberries-
and-cream; and at State balls, dowager-peeresses would almost climb
on to the backs of good-looking young actors to catch a glimpse
of the beautiful Mrs. SPRATT dancing with Royalty.
In vain she sought a refuge from this fashionable persecution in
the solitudes of Rosherville, or the groves of Hampstead Heath on a
Bank holiday. Even there she was recognised (by our friend 'ARRY,
no doubt), and knock'emdowns, nigger minstrels and all, even the
good old game of "kiss-in-the-ring?' were deserted to stare at her,
(just as at Chiswick and Campden Hill; for human nature is the
same everywhere.)
When she appeared at the Opera, PATTI sang in vain. In vain
did our most fashionable preachers preach when Mrs. SPRATT made
one of the congregation; in vain did Messrs. HUXLEY or TYNDAL.L
lecture in Albomarle Street, or Professor MAX MULLER at West-
minster Abbey, if Mrs. SPRATT were among the lectured. Even
the whales at the Aquarium would look small by Mrg. SPRATT'S
side, and Cleopatra's Needle would lose its point if Mrs. SPRATT
drove on the Embankment. At the Crystal Palace people forgot
to listen to the big organ; the cattle at the Cattle Show were left in
peace; Irish Members obstructed Home Rulers; Mr. GLADSTONE
lost the thread of his impeachment; Captain SHAW lost all control
over his men: North London trains ran into Metropolitan; pleasure-
vans drove, hooraying, into MARSHALL AND SNT.LGROVE'S; steam-
rollers rolled bang into GUNTER'S or GRANGE'S; Old Bailey juries
forgot to listen. Old Bailey Judges to sum up, Old Bailey barristers
were condemned to death, Old Bailey solicitors removed in the van,
while murderers left the Court without a stain on their character;
and Heaven knows what all besides! and all through Mrs. SPRATT
being there. Indeed, the only people who in that magic presence
seemed to retain some self-possession, and keep an eye to business
as well as an eye to beauty, were the pickpockets, who voted
Mrs. SPRATT a public benefactor; and the photographers, who
blessed her very name 1
Even abroad her influence was felt; for it was whispered in high
political circles that at the Cabul Conference Lord B cunningly
distracted old Prince G 's attention from the matter in hand oy
flowery descriptions of Mrs. SPRATT'S charms, and so demoralised
that venerable statesman, that Count S had repeatedly to call
him to order; but was nearly lost to the C for all that.
And the best of it is, that everybody wondered how everybody
else could bo such a fool! especially the intelligent foreigner, who
could not make out why, in this land of pretty women, there should
be so much commotion about one pretty woman the more. And
not such a very pretty woman either, he thought; for prettiness is
a matter of taste, and not a mathematical certainty; and he would
shrug his shoulders, and exclaim, " Sont-iia ilrules, ces Anglais, sont-
ils droles '"

Yet 'tis but human natur'
To roundly execrate her

Together with her pater,
Her mater, and \ierfrater .'
I would assimilate her
With grisly Alligator—
I 'd blow her up—inflate her
With gas, and elevate her,
And drop her in a crater.
If this would not abate her,
I 'd take and saturate her
With tar and feathers. Later,
I would excoriate her I
And if there's torment greater
Why, let it still await her,
And let me be spectator—
I BO abominate her,
And all who imitate her

The vile PERAMBULATOR!
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
SIR,—I went to see Her Majesty's Servants perform WILLIAM
SHAKSPEAHE'S Romantic Play of The Winter's Tale. I wonder if it
was the great " situation" in the Statue Scene that first struck
WILLIAM, and set him to work on this drama? It certainly is worth
waiting for. I don't think WILLIAM took much pains over some
portion of the play, specially with regard to Antigonus, and his
incumbrance in " A Desert Country'near the Sea"—a very awkward
spot for an elderly Gentleman, unaccustomed to children, to be
left alone in with a Baby.
WILLIAM knew as well as anyone that a Baby on the stage was a
safe laugh: and how he has got over the difficulty is a study in
itself. In Scene 3 of Act I., where the Baby, in a cradle, makes its
flrst appearance, he distracts our attention from the Infant; and it
is Paulina, the scold, and Antigonus, the henpecked, who excite our
laughter. In "A Desert Countryj" the old Shepherd who flnds the
Babe, is brought on as soon as possible; and he and his son introduce
the low comedy. But the Baby is a difficulty.
Again, what is the real use of Antolycus as an aid to the plot?
None whatever. In the present day the story would have been
told to an English audience in four Acts, and as many Scenes; and
in Paris it would have taken three Authors to write the piece; and
they, having to share the evening's per-oentage on receipts among
them, would have been very careful to have eked out the plot in ;is
many Acts, Tableaux, and Parts as possible, which, with the long
Entr'actes, would infallibly prevent any other piece being performed
with it to the injury of their fees. It is this desire to go in for the
entire per-centage that gives rise to the long-windedness of the
French Melodramatists, and the interminable talkiness of SABDOU,
who, until he positively feels that he has tried even the enduranoe
of a Parisian audience to its limits, is a sort of Wandering Jew of
dramatic dialogue. The Winter's Tale, in the hands of French
Authors, would have been told over and over again, ad nauseam, in
the course of the piece.
It seemed to me that even the innate British reverence for the text
of the Divine WILLIAMS was scarcely strong enough to prevent the
densely-packed audience in Drury Lane from expressing their dis-
taste for the repulsive exhibition of jealousy displayed by Leontes
in the First Act.
The Divine WILLIAMS made no ado about calling a spade a spade,
and in Mr. CHABLES DILLON'S reading of the part, the lines lose
nothing of their revolting coarseness. That the King's jealousy is

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
indeed a " brief madness " does not occur to the uncritical spectator
until the dramatist makes Paulina allude, in Act II. Sc. 2, to
"These dangerous unsafe Junes i' the King!"
And, in Act III. Sc. 2, when upbraiding him to his face for his
previous conduct, she says,
"0 think what they have done,
And then run mnd indeed; stark mad! for all
Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it."
But the explanation, for the sake of the audience, comes too late.
Then what an awkward contrivance is the sudden appearance of
Time as Chorus, informing us that " Sixteen years are supposed to
have elapsed" between the last scene of Act III. and the first of
Act IV.
How came this lumbering Time scene to be written in? I think I
see the true answer. JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD once suggested that
SHAXSPEABE played the Ghost in Hamkt, because, being Manager,
and havinp an eye to business, he could run round, in the intervals
between his appearances on the stage, and " count the house;" and
our own SHIRLEY BROOKS always insisted on the Divine WILLIAMS
being regarded not as a poet crowned with laurel, but as a hard-
working "Actor, Manager, and Author too," going in for rehearsal,
really "meaning business" and inventing it. "By this light,"
then, I sec how this Time episode was brought in.
How came it about? Did Mr. CHATTERTON-BURBAGE tell Mr.
WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE that they had a man in the company who
could speak a few lines, and who; haying nothing to do in the piece,
was being paid a salary for dom^ it? Or, was there a difficulty
about the stage-arrangements, and the Manager wanting to gain
time, asked WILLIAM if he couldn't shove in something "just to
fill up, eh?" And did WILLIAM, -with ready wit, immediately
reply, "What? want to get time between the Acts? Beshrew me,
you shall have Time;" and forthwith going to the prompt-table,
did he seize pen and paper, and write the stage-direction, and the
lines, and saying, "There's plenty of Time for you!" hand the
scrawl to the Theatre copyist'(
Miss FOWLEK is a graceful, pretty Perdita, and Mr. EDWARD
COMFTON as noble a young Florizel as the ingenuous Milkmaid her-
self could wish. Mr. JOHN RYDER as Antigonm was excellent in
his great comic scene with the Baby (Music, "Don't make a noise,
or else you '11 wake the Baby! "—a suggestion for Mr. KARL MEYDER
in the orchestra), and I was really sorry when the Clotcn (Mr.
S. CALHAEM) came on, and told us that Pantaloon had been eaten
by a Bear behind the scenes. What an opportunity was here lost
of a genuine Pantomimic scene between the Clown (Mr. S. CALHAEM),
Pantaloon--4n<ijronKi (Mr. JOHN RYDER), the Bear (one of the LAUBI
family), and the Baby! More music for Mr. KABL MEYDER—" Oh,
what a day we are having!" and several political hits about the
Bear. But Mr. CHATTERTON rightly felt that he must go no further
in anticipating Christmas than was warranted by the Inspired
Dramatist's " Dance of Twelve Rustics habited at Satyrs."
This, again, looks uncommonly like the pump and tubs of Mr.
CRUMMLES in SHAKSPEARE's time. "I say, said Mr. CBUMMLES-
BUBBAGE to Mr. SHAKSPEARE, "I bought all the dresses and
properties for that last Masque, and we 've only used 'em once;
couldn't you bring 'em in again somehow?" And Mr. WILLIAM,
the easiest-going Author in the world, as long as his pet lines were
well delivered, looked over the manuscript, saw exactly the place
for the dance, wrote in a few introductory speeches, and the thing
was done—and done well.
Antigonus hasn't much to say, as no doubt the Mr. JOHN RYDER
of SHAISPEARE'S time pointed out rather forcibly to the dramatist,
who, admitting the justice of the objection, waited till he saw an
opportunity in Act II. Sc. 3, where Antigonus is. for the most part,
standing mmnchance before his scolding wife, and then made Leontes
turn on him with—
"And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hanged
That wilt not stay her tongue.'*
And gave Antigonus the telling retort—
"Hang all the husbands
That cannot do that feat, you '11 leaye yourself
Hardly one subject."
Which, of course, coming from the Mr. JOHN RYDER of SHAKSPEARE'S
time, brought down thenouse, as it does every night at Drury Lane.
The Divine WILLIAMS knew how to sweeten the draught, and induce
his best men to play small parts.
The performance throughout at Drury Lane is generally good.
Mrs. HERMANN YEZIN'S Paulina is admirable, and thoroughly
deserved the generally hearty applause that recalled her before the
curtain after the Third Scene of the Second Act. She is never once
indistinct—a fault common now-a-days to most Actors, whether in
large or small theatres. If my friends in front will take my advice,
and closely watch the manner, bearing, and remarkable ""get up"
of two distinguished, but untitlea. Noblemen, mentioned mysteriously
in the playbill as "Two other Sicilian Lords," they will not have
visited the " Lane" in vain. A classic slave, with the whiskers of
Jeames of Berkeley Square, will also be an interesting study for the
antiquarian. A better choice for Hermione than Miss WALLIS
could not be made for Drury Lane. Mr. BEVERLY'S scenery is, of
course, a strong feature in the revival.
Mr. PHELPS is announced for November, to appear as Cardinal
Tl'olsey; and there are to be morning performances of Operas in
English, under the direction of Mr. KABL MEYDER, and the Panto-
mime, with the VOKESES in it, is to be Cinderella, written by an
entirely new hand — one Mr. E. L. BLANCHARD — of whom report
says great things, and who, I am informed, has not written more
than a hundred capital Christmas Annuals for the delight of old and
young children at this very theatre. Prosit. Here 's to you, Mr.
E. L. B., and of course He 'II be as successful as ever, which is the

develope the resources of the establishment? A propos of Clarkes —

fondness implied in tending that creature as though it were a
baby. Was the original good man who kissed his cow, and said,
"Everyone to his liking!" a canny Scot?
PARADOXICAL PLANETS.
THE Sun gives Venus very much less light
Than Mercury, yet she shines as much more bright.
Why does the darker Planet look the lighter;
The less illumined shine by far the brighter'(
The reason is, Astronomers declare,
Her atmosphere is dense, and his is rare.
He hath no clouds, and probably no water.
Both has the bright Orb named from Ocean's Daughter.
Vapour, indeed, the face of Venus shrouds;
But there's a silver lining to her clouds,
The side of them that's turned towards the Sun.
Of course as silver shines, so shines that one.
To Womankind it is an old objection
That they are Man's inferiors in reflection.
But Venus a superior power displays
To Mercury's, of reflecting solar ravs.
There 's reason—din it into Men's dull ears
In proof of Woman's wit, Strong-Minded Dears.

THE OPPRESSED IN EXCELSIS;
OR, ALMOST ENOUGH OF IT?
THE Executive Committee of the Very Green Island Chained,
Gagged, Stifled, and Strangled Patriots' Society met again yesterday
for the further discussion of public business.
After a little preliminary window-breaking, and a free fight or
two in the body of the hall as the best method of opening the pro-
ceedings, the Chairman, who took his seat amid a shower of oaths
and inkstands, said—they had been summoned together on the
present occasion for the purpose of taking into immediate considera-
tion the attitude that their great, glorious, and giant-strengthened
Society ought to assume in the face of the yawning gulf that he was
happy to think was now opening visibly under the feet of the surly
and cowardly British beast—(cheers)—who for eight-and-twenty
centuries had. been growling at them from the other side of St.
George's Channel. (Tremendous cheering.) It was an important
moment. Though so stilled, as all the generous and civilised world
knew it to be, was the whispering voice of liberty in the mouth of
the very green islander that he could now only snout out what the
brutal ana bloodthirsty oppressor called " treason" in the miserable
and ineffective shape of as much newspaper fine writing as he could
possibly turn out;—though his limbs were so chafed with the iron
shackles of a grim and despotic executive that he had not yet been
able even to blow the Tower of London bodily into the Thames, or
to tear the Crown and Constitution into shreds on St. Stephen's
Green;—though the sweet lady-like spirit of the beauteous nation
was so utterly collapsed in a perfect heap over her battered, mangled,
and stringless harp that it had become impossible to raise to the
memory of the glorious martyrs of '71, '74, ^83, '85, '98, '2, '10, '15,
'37, '39, '47, '56, '62, '65, '70, '72, and '76 more than a couple of
colossal monuments all round every six months ;—though, in a word,
the brightest, the liveliest, the most intellectual, and, on the whole,
the cleanest people in the world, had been so outraged, downtrodden,
neglected, choked, that they now scarcely knew what it was they
really wanted—(loud and prolonged cheering)—yes, though things
had come to this pitiable and awful pass, still, a golden, gleaming,
and streaming blaze of breaking sunrise was already gilding with
glittering jewels the riven roots of the green sea and gem-washed
island! (A voice—"More power to you.'") Yes; for when the
dastard ensign that was dragged by fraud and fear up the easy
slopes of the Alma and through the pleasant shades of Inkerman,—
the hated flag is about at last to be trampled low under the august
and holy feet of the very green Islanders' personal and admirable
friend, the enlightened potentate who, from St. Petersburg, directs
the progress of European liberty
But here the speech of the Chairman was suddenly brought to an
abrupt conclusion by the quite unexpected appearance of Mr.
Punch who, at the head of a large following of real Irish boys,"
ready and eager for the welcome work, cleared the hall of what they
called " all thim foreign varmin," and put an end to the proceedings
without even the formal sham of an " adjournment sine die."

VERY MUCH ABROAD!

FATHEH,
IN compliance •with
your request, I have
been "improving my mind
by travelling" for the last
week, and I seize a leisure
moment to tell you where
I have been—so far, of
course, as I have been able
to make out. I am not at
all sure of my facts or 'my
names, as our movements
have been very rapid. We
have certainly got over a
wonderful amount of
ground, and, if my mind
could be improved when I
started, 1 am sure by this
time it must have reached
perfection. However,
thanks to your kindness
and a Grammar School, my
wits have always been
tolerably bright. My only
regret, as 1 write these
lines, is the feeling that
you possibly may not be
able to read them. Ah! my
dear Father, if my Grand-
father had only treated you as you have treated me! Education is
indeed a blessing! If you only knew as much about reading,
writing, and arithmetic (the three It's as you rather inaccurately
call them), as you do about farming, what a clever man you would
be! But we can't have everything. A thought which affords me
infinite consolation when I consider that I myself know far more
about Greek roots than English turnips.
To return to my trip. As it was my first visit to foreign parts,
you thought it better that I should travel with a party rather than
trust to my own inexperienced guidance. Doubtless you were right,
but certainly a great number of my companions were a little uncul-
tivated. Many of them saw the sea for the first time as we left
Newhaven, and not a few asked me if they could find a quiet public-
house where they could get a " hunch of bread and cheese and a glass
of beer" at Paris. From this you may take it that their ideas ol the
Continent were, to say the least, a little vague. But what right
have I to speak of vagueness, when my own notions are so decidedly
confused? I can assure you, my dear Father, I have been doing my
very best to take in where we have been and what we have seen, but
with the feeblest results. If you doubt me, read the following
transcript of my Diary, which I have kept from day to day at odd
times in odd corners:—
Monday.—We have arrived in Paris. Of this I am quite certain,
because we have been hurried through a large sort of bazaar which
must have been the Exhibition. So far as I could see (as we ran about),
there seemed to be a good deal to look at. We passed the pictures
so rapidly that they appeared to be a kind of unconnected panorama.
After we had done the Exhibition, I think we went to the Louvre,
or it may have been the Luxembourg, or perhaps it was the Maison
Dieu. At any rate, wherever we went, we saw one picture which
cost (so we were told) the French Government no less than two
hundred thousand francs. I forget what the picture was about and
who painted it, but I am tolerably sure that I have got the figures
right.
Tuesday.—From what I can make out, we seem to be in Switzer-
land. AU this morning we have been looking at hills, and I hear
that some of them are very high, with snow at the top. You have
honey at breakfast in Switzerland. I think we have been to Bale.
We may have been to Interlacken, and I rather fancy we have, for I
know we were to go there, and we keep to our route most religiously.
If we did go to Interlacken, I forget what it was like. Our Con-
ductor is full of information. All I can remember, however, of his
lecture is that the Municipal Government of Berne pays for the keep
of some bears.
Wednesday.—I rather think we must be in Germany. As we
were flying past a station this morning, I think I saw a Prussian
helmet. We have certainly seen a good deal to-day. Lots of
statues and lots of places. I should not be surprised to find, on
referring to my programme, that I have gazed upon the celebrated
Castle of Heidelberg, and perhaps even seen Cologne Cathedral.
Unluckily, one has so little time for consideration, that before you
are quite sure that you are looking at a mountain, you find yourself
facing a waterfall. The lecture to-day was more than usually inter-
esting. I remember distinctly that our guide informed us that a
large quantity of Eau-de-Cologne is really made in Cologne.
Thursday,—We have been in a steamboat all day, looking at lots
of castles and hills. We have been listening to such a number of
legends that I forget what they are all about, A great deal of wine
is made upon this river for exportation abroad. Our guide gave us
some interesting statistics about the various vineyards. I did not
like to interrupt him to ask him the name of the river. It appears
to be rather pretty, and in some places reminds me of our Thames
above Richmond.
Friday.—It now appears that yesterday we were doing the Rhine.
To-day we are, I think, somewhere in Italy. I know we have been
through a big tunnel. The people, too, eeem to be talking a different
sort of language. I have not hud time to think much about any-
thing, as we have been galloping through some score of picture-
galleries. Tb,e guide's lecture was again most interesting. Sir
PETER RUBBERS deceived the honour of knighthood. We were all
pleased to hear this.
Saturday.—I really don't know wliere we are, hut we are going
to see a cathedral, four picture-galleries, a couple of glaciers, and an
amphitheatre or two, after breakfast.
And at this point my Diary stops, as it is my last entry. For
obvious reasons I have put no address to this letter. Firstly, I
don't know in the least where we are; and, secondly, if I did it
would be of no earthly use to tell you, because, before you can
receive this note I shall be thousands of miles away from the reading-
room of this very fourth-rate hotel.
I began by saying that my mind is perfect. So it is—it is a perfect
blank. Before I left Old England, I had some sort of notion of
foreign lands, but since I have taken this trip my knowledge, such
as it was, has entirely disappeared. The Continent now seems to me
a jumble of second-class carriages, vague castles, indistinct water-
courses, xmdigested picture-galleries, indifferent tables-d'hote. dis-
appointing beauties of Nature, incomprehensible statues, confused
town-halls, and unappreciated cathedrals. Nevertheless, my dear
Father, many thanks; for whatever may be the result of my tour,
you certainly meant well.
In great haste (as we are again en route),
Tour affectionate Son,
GILES CLODHOPPER, Jun.
FASHIONABLE INTELLIGENCE.
HEBE is a bit of news, which to some people may prove of para-
mount importance :—
"For a rich dinner toilette mahogany is now a colour likely to be popular.
Ruby and bright rose will also be in rogue this autumn."
For a dinner dress mahogany may seem a fitting hue, and there is
something quite convivial in rose-colour and ruby. They remind us
of the songs which Mr. Swireller was so fond of, wherein "the
rosy" and "the ruby" were so copkmsly poured forth. Such
colours seem less suitable for ladies than for men, and there is some-
thing still more masculine in the fashion next recorded :—
"A semi-fitting jacket with faille collar and revere opens over a waistcoat
of bronze faille made precisely like those worn by gentlemen."
Jackets and waistcoats may be worn by Ladies without question,
but there are certain other manly garments which we fondly hope
will never be in fashion with the fair sex. Moreover, we will trust
that wearing male attire may not lead to manly habits on the part
of those adopting it. A man might stare if a cigar-case were to drop
from his aunt's jacket as he helped her to her carriage; and if a
husband were to borrow a white waistcoat of his wife, he might feel
a little annoyed to find a latch-key in the pocket.
More Sites and Bounds.
THE Alcazo r! The Alcazar.'
Will soon appear in Leicester Squarr.
I only hope the Alcazar Directors
Have Leicester-squared the circle of objectors.
If so, the Company has shown some nous
In taking such a site as Savill House.
But shocked Alhambra cried, as well she might,
"'Tis very rude near me to take a site!"
Darwinism for I Doctors.
AT .King's College the subject of the introductory Lecture delivered
on Saint Pheasant's Day, by Professor GARROD, is described to have
been " The Evolution of the Medical Profession, and the Survival of
the Fittest to Practise and Struggle for a Professional Existence."
It is generally a struggle for existence, indeed; aud if anybody
thinks of engaging in it, and living by his practice alone, be it known
to him that he cannot reasonably expect to exist very long.

KINDNESS AND CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.
THE following passage in a Report of the introductory Lecture delivered, on the
1st instant, by Professor RAY LANKESTEB at University College, is commended to the
serious consideration of the Society for the Total and Entire Abolition of Vivisection :—
"It was grossly unfair of Englishmen to legislate against the study of physiology, to refuse
to Medicine all means of research, all endowments, and yet to profit by Vivisection carried on in
Germany. Every man and woman who consulted an English physician or surgeon was an accomplice
of physiology, and connived at Vivisection; for the English medical man had now to gain his
knowledge from Germany and France."
What effect, then, will be likely to result from an Act of Parliament to prohibit
altogether the practice of Vivisection in this country'? Simply, that of still more
necessarily and generally driving British medical students, in order to acquire the
necessary physiological knowledge, abroad. The mere stoppage of Vivisection in our
medical schools will only tend to promote its practice in those of other countries;
and that under no limitations imposed by humanity. Perhaps, therefore, the Anti-
Vivisectionists will perceive it to be advisable that any enactment for the suppression
of experiments on living animals in the United Kingdom should, in order that it may
not operate to the increase instead of the diminution of animal suffering, be accompanied
by a rider subjecting every student of Medicine and Surgery to .an interdict equivalent
to the writ Ne exeat regno.
Archaeologists at Work.
THE Rev. Canon GREENWELL, F.R.S., and the Rev. WAITER MONEY, F.S.A., of
Newbury, are reported to have been exploring certain of the numerous Celtic grave-
mounds in North Wiltshire, one of which they opened last week, and discovered in it
human skeletons, animals' bones, a pot, a bone pin, a flake of flint, some beads, and a
kind of scraper. Success to the interesting researches in which the reverend and learned
Gentlemen are still engaged. Their labours deserve every encouragement; and although
they are Antiquaries, and not Costermongers, it may not be improper to say to those
assiduous examiners of ancient British tumuli, " Go on with your Barrow!"
A DREAM OF QUEER WOMEN.
(With Apologies to the Poet-Laureate.)
1 HEAD, before mine eyelids dropt their shade,
The last rqmaace from MUDIE'S, lately writ
By one who is considered—in the trade—
The flower of female wit.
Miss BLANK, the famous writer, whose wild way
Of fiction-weaving was the first to fill
The startled times of good VICTORIA
With ghosts which haunt them still.
And for awhile I tumbled on my bed,
Her Art from slumber held me, as strong gales
Hold driven birds from lighting, and my head,
Chock-full of her strange tales,
Charged both mine eyes with horror. Her black
band
Haunted my thoughts, and everywhere I saw
Beauty and Murder walking hand-in-hand,
Dogged by smart limbs of law.
At last methought that I had wandered far
Into some limbo, wild, inane, obscure,
Where all things seemed to jostle, grumble, jar,
And nought seemed straight or sure.
There was no freshness in the heavy air,
Nor any natural sound of speech or song,
The smell of patchouli reigned everywhere,
An odour stale yet strong.
And from within me something seemed to say,
"Be careful! This is an unhealthy clime.
Pass quickly through; you will not wish to stay
For any length of time."
At last I saw a Lady within call,
Stiffer than stiflest marble, standing there;
A daughter of the giants, strangely tall,
And sulphurously fair.
Her hideousness with horror and surprise
Tied up my tongue. She, turning on my face
The lamp-like lustre of her goggle-eyes,
Spoke hoarsely in her place:—
"I 'm an Art-Beauty! Do not ask my name,
1 have so many!" (Here she heaved a sigh.)
"The supersensuous critics sound my fame,
I 'm sure I can't tell why."
"/marvel, too, the fact I won't conceal,
Your face appears pea-green, your locks look
dyed,"
I answered free, and, turning, made appeal
To one who stood beside.
But she, with sour and spleenful looks averse,
To her lank height her bony body draws.
"My sex," she said, "is blighted by the curse
Of harsh man-fashioned laws.
"I am cut off from hope of that fair place
St. Stephen's hight, where men our shackles
frame,
With issues that involve our deep disgrace
And their eternal shame.
"Yet I can speak—I do so now and then—
For of the shrieking sisterhood am I,
And still the bearded monsters, ruthless men,
The franchise dare deny."
Whereto that other with a scornful brow:—
"I 'd put my dagger-edge to mine own throat
Could I not fool and rule fond man somehow,
Without a stupid Vote!"
Her bitter words flashed through the silence
drear;
Methought'' Can an Art-Beauty be a shrew ?''
Sudden I heard a voice that cried, " Come here!
I want to look at you."
I, turning, saw, curled in an easy chair,
One sitting well wrapped up, as if from cold,
Her cheeks were peachy, and her fluffy hair
Was of the tawny gold.

She, flashing forth a Circe-smile, began:—
"I murdered men for fun—it was my trade;
But oh, 'tis long since I have slain a man.
Once, panther-like, I played
"With many husbands, and then shed their blood,
But life in this dim place is vastly slow;
I have no men to murder in my mood—
That makes my only woe!
"The men, my lovers, how they bowed their necks
'Neath the neat boots wherewith my feet were shod!
I witched them, and the sturdiest of the sex
Were vassals to my nod.
"At last the sly detective tracked me down;
I tried to coax him, but the brute was cold.
They found the last poor fool I tried to drown,
And for the rest—behold'"
With that she tore her robe apart, and half
The polished ivory of her shoulders grand
Laid bare. Thereto she pointed with a laugh,
Showing the convict's brand.
*****
Losing her laughter, I stood drowsily
As doth a slavev with fatigue hall dead
When lodgers' bells are ringing low and high,
Though it.is time for bed.
"Alas! alas!" a low voice full of care
Grumbled beside me; "turn and look on me!
I 'm the enamoured girL as fast as fair,
If what I was I be.
"Would I had been some dowdy dull and cold
O me! that I should ever see the light
Of those male optics burning, black, and bold,
Which haunt me day and night!
"I frisked and flirted, said most risque things,
Mixed the salacious with the smart-profane,
Knew all about the kiss that burns and stings,
The clasp that fires the brain.
"Then came an ugly brute, all brawn and beard,
Witched me with insolence I fancied grand,
And, knowing not if most I loved or feared,
I gave the wretch my hand.
"He made me his mere slave. My fate was just!"
To whom the Panther, "Oh, you tamely fell!
You should have chloroformed the clown, and thrust
His carcase down a well."
AYith that smart speech, sheer horror's creeping thrill,
Cold at my heart, dissolved the agony
Of nightmare sleep. I woke, extremely chill,
And cramped, and much awry.
Morn breached the sombre ramparts of the dark,
Ere I saw her of the agayant glance,
With mien like some Anonyma of the Park,
And morals fresh from France.
Or her who, flouting love as very trash,
And holding life's first aim the wedding-ring,
Deems not mere soft affection, but hard cash
The all-important thing.
No Miner labours harder from the deep
Dark mines of coal to hew the sooty seams.
When market-rates rule high, than I from sleep
To gather more such dreams.
Not that the visions pleased; they gave me pain.
Yet might it profit men could 1 but strike
Into that startling track of dreams again;
But no two dreams are like.
For me, I loathe, as an unholy pest,
The Women worshipped in these latter years,
With loathing that can hardly be exprest,
By shudders, groans, or tears.
Because these Creatures of Sensation-Art,
Failing in all that's natural, wholesome, sweet,
Sicken the fancy and oppress tie heart
With weariness complete.

HAPPY GO LUCKY!"

his
R. ADAM and
Constituents" was
the heading of a
paragraph in the Daily Tele-
graph. I don't suppose that
DABWIH would be reckoned
among the constituents of our
Mr. ADAM.
The Whitehall Review has
published two lists—unneces-
sary, and professedly most
incomplete—of " Rome'sCon-
verts. 1 am at least glad to
gee the word "Converts"
used. "Pervert" is design-
edly malicious and illiteral:
'"vert" is vulgar. There
are some who object to all
three. For the benefit of this
class of kindly-disposed per-
sons, I would propose the use
of the word " Revert." Pro-
testants of the nineteenth
century, in the free exercise
of their private judgment,
conscientiously renouncing
the religion of their fathers,
only revert to that of their
great-great-greatest grand-
fathers in the sixteenth cen-
tury. And, in most cases, the Reverts'.have suffered serious reverses
in consequence of.their.Reversion.
^MrTcHARLES WYWDHAM. of the Criterion Theatre, as a grateful
tribute to the success of the well-known piece still running, will
henceforth date everything from Anno Dominoi.
SHAKSPEARE evidently imagined steam locomotion as existing
between Sicilia and Bohemia in most remote times ;—vide Winter's
Tale (as Mr. CHATTERTON would say just now), Act V. Sc. 1. where,
when a Gentleman of the Court—not Mr. JonK HARE, though that's
a neat designation for the Manager in Sloane Square—announces
the arrival of Florizel and Perdita, the King observes—
"'Tis not a visitation"—
meaning that Florizel was not an Archbishop—
11 'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
By nt-ed and accident."
The word "accident" suggests the anxious question that imme-
diately follows—
"What train?"
But to this the Gentleman of the Court does not make a fitting
reply. He does not refer His Majesty to Bradshaic, or a local time-
table. But, after all, it was only one of WILLIAM'S flashes of inspi-
ration—just like him.
The Reverend Mr. EVERARD, of Wolverhampton, who, at the
Church Congress last week, as the Bishop of MANCHESTER observed,
Quite took his breath away by his fierce denunciation of the
jo round the corner immediately after the performance, and have a
iquor up with a brother "Pro.," and didn't thev wink at one
another over their glasses as they drank his Lordship's jolly good
health?
But, Mr. EVERARD (by the way, don't I know how clever Miss
ETERARD is as "poor Little Buttercup" at the Opera Comique—any
relation ?), but, Sir, while you and t'others of the Cloth—not Broad
Hoth, but narrow, I mean—enjoy freedom of speech and liberty for
all sorts of opinions, the Stage has a strict Censor Morum,
A High Cockalorum,
Chief Censor Morum,
—(not a "censer" as used by Ritualists, whom you very likely con-
bund, and worse than confound, with Theatrical people generally)—
who won't allow anything wrong or rude, and who has just refused
lis licence to a very risky French piece called Niniche, for whom
one of the Brothers ROWE had provided an English dress with the
very propercst skirts.
So that's a finish
For poor little yin'tehe.
Yes, Anglicised, Niniche does rhyme with finish; ask Mr. ROWE. By
the way, I don't know which ROWE it wa», whether Hard ROWE or
Soft ROWE, or First ROWE, or Second ROWE ; but, anyhow, in answer
:o his touching appeal, the Licenser only waved his hand, and said,
with senatorial dignity, "Back, ROWE!" Back ROWE smiled sadly
and replied, that he would adapt himself—to the peculiar circum-
stances. The deputation of One then withdrew. "Rebellion's
dead!" exclaimed the Licenser with King Arthur in Tom Thumb,
"and now we '11 go to breakfast!" For the motto of the Theatrical
Licensing Department in the Lord Chamberlain's Office must ever be
Piece with honour."

by the quality of so much brain as he may happen to possess—has
many opportunities at Wolverhampton for seeing some excellent
acting; tor the Wolverhampton Theatre is rather a favourite with
some of our London Stars—Fallen Stars, eh, Mr. EVER-SOFT, like
Mr. J. L. TOOLE, for example ?—and some of our London Stars are
great favourites at Wolverhampton, greater, perhaps, than even
Mr. EVERABD himself. Mr. EVEHARD, however, Knows no more of a
Theatrical Star than the child in Dr. WATTS'S hymn :—

The tip-top swells of the Dramatic Profession arc a considerable
cut above Mr. EVERARD, who is, probably, a very Low Churchman
and only in the rank and file of l1 Soupers." The Bishop of MAN-
CHESTER spoke fairly well on the subject, but what a gushing goody-
goody story that was of his about the Manchester T. R. Stage

MERCY BY THE MERSEY.
[MANCHK8TE*.-Mr. RAYNERWOOD, ft Magistrate, residing
at Singleton Lodge, Singleton Brook, prosecuted two bisters ot
Mercy lor begging. These Sisters support a Urge number of
nged and infirm poor at Plymouth Grove and Cheetham Hill
The case was at once diimiaed, the Bench regretting that
Mr. WOOD should have acted in this manner.— Daily Ifle-
yraph, Oct. 7.]
THERE is a Mr. RAYTTEK "WOOD,
A Magistrate, be it understood,
Of Singleton Lodge, near Singleton Brook,
Who on himself as Magistrate took
To arrest two Sisters of Mercy-
Two Little Sisters of the Poor,
Who beg about from door to door,
And with their pensioners try to live
On scraps of food that the rich may give,
These genuine Sisters of Mercy.
But Mister WOOD, with his heart of stone,
Would not give them so much as a bone;
But had the Sisters locked up all night.
As Beggars! Fancy their wretched plight,
These Angels of Mercy! Was Mister WOOD right?
No! Very much vice versy.
And BO, next morning, he was told
Bv a brother Magistrate, honest and bold,
Who, indignantly .the case dismissed,
When I hope Mr. WOOD was loudly hissed—
Be he tall, or short, or pursy,
This WOOD '• not British Oak, 1 guess,
"Laying hands on females in distress!
The worst I wish him—when near his end-
To ease his anguish, and to attend
On his couch of pain, may his Good Angel send
These very two Sisters of Mercy!

Pleasantries of a Primus.
PI-NCH often finds competitors where he did not
expect them. But of all unlikely places to look for a
rival he would have named the meeting of the Repre-
sentative Church Council of the Emscopal Church ot
Scotland. It was held in the Kinnaird Hall on the 9th
inst. Judge his surprise when he found the venerable
Primus of that highly decorous Church thus disporting
himself :—
"The Primus proposed that the next annual meeting be held
at Inverness, and he undertook to say that they would receive a
right Highland welcome. Perhaps the laity might feel tnem-
Felves disposed 10 come in Highland costume— (laughter)— and
if so they might rely upon it there would be no visible breaches
amongst them. (Great laughter.)"
THE PLEASURES OF FOREIGN TRAVEL.
THE pleasure of feeling that you have left all the bores of your
Club behind for an indefinite time.
The pleasure of knowing that you need not attend to litt
accounts" when they follow you to France, Switzerland, or Italy.
The pleasure of escaping the fogs of London, the winds of Brighton,
and the drainage of Ramsgate.
The pleasure of knowing that all news of an exciting character
will reach you some days late; and if the Funds have gone down,
that they may have gone up again by the time you receive the un-
welcome intelligence.
The pleasure of finding it unnecessary to condole with JONES upon
the failure of his last comedy, or to congratulate SMITH upon the
success of his latest novel.
The pleasure of not having to wear a tail-coat and white necktie
more than once a week on the average. ,
The pleasure of having one's French understood by a well-fee d
and, consequently, obsequious foreign waiter.
The pleasure of travelling in comfort, and lunching en route on
something more palatable than sawdust sandwiches and turpentine-
flavoured sherry. , , .
The pleasure of buying and reading all the best novels and wor
of travel at about one shilling and sixpence a volume.

with those of your native land, to the great glorification ot the latter.

draught porter from the pewter, and a cut off a roast sirloin.

And, lastly—greatest pleasure of all—the intense delight and

again! ___^^

AN old and true saw tells us that "Spectators see most of the
game." Punch's sharp and respected contemporary, the'.Spectator,
seems to him to have a clear insight into the game which the Glasgow
Bank has been plaving. That game, if play to the Bank s Directors,
is likely to prove death to the Shareholders. But surely the Spectator
has got the right sow by the ear, in his concluding paragraph: —
"Many a murder is stopped by fear of the coroner's inquest, many a ship
is saved bv dread of the Board of Trade inquiry, and many a bank would be
'safe if its "Directors knew that failure would be the immediate signal for a
pitiless investigation."
To he followed, Punch would add, by condign punishment in cases
where rascality and recklessness are brought home to the peccant
parties who have abused their opportunities as Directors to the ruin
of their Shareholders. At all events, the change would be one from
the wrong to the right direction.

DARWINIAN MOMENT—SELECTION OF THE FITTEST!
ON THE LINE.
(With Mr. Punch's best wishes to the Amalgamated Society of
Railway Scrrants.)
ME. PUNCH was dozing on the banks of a river, enjoying the
welcome warmth of the latter-summer. As he gazed upon the
running water, it seemed to change to a railway-track, and he saw
a pair of iron rails appearing from a double row of sand-covered
sleepers. Near the track stood a well-fed, rosy-cheeked labourer
cheerfully employed upon his toil of plate-laying. Mr. Punch was
surprised to notice his perfect contentment. Until now plate-laying
had always been accompanied by apprehension.
"You nave no fear of any passing train, my friend?" said Mr.
Punch.
"Not I, master," returned the workman, with a careless whistle.
"You see, since the new law came in, the Engine-drivers daren't run
over me. If they did, they would have to answer for it."
Leaving the Plate-layer, Mr. Punch walked on until he came to
the train stopping in a siding. The Engine-driver was calmly smoking
a pipe.
"All right?" questioned Mr. Punch.
"Quite right, Sir," replied the Engine-driver. "If anything goes
wrong, so long as I obey the Guard!, I am on the safe side of the
road. If anything happens to me, and my mate through hit care-
lessness, why our widows can proceed (as the lawyers call it) against
Aim for damages."
"How do you like that P" asked Mr. Punch, as the Guard
approached him.

P. 0. ORDER FOR THIRTEEN SHILLINGS AND SIXPENCE, HOPINO IT WILL DO YOU AS LITTLE GOOD AS YOUR TWO VERY SMALL BOTTLES
OF "PHYSIC" DID ME.'"
"Very well, Sir," replied the man with the belt. "Personal
responsibility won't hurt any of us so long as we do our duty. I
feel much more comfortable now that I know I have a remedy against
the Signalman if I come to grief through his culpable carelessness."
And Mr. Punch walked on until he reached a box full of tele-
graph-discs. A lively, bright-eyed official was in charge.
I suppose you have just come on duty?" hinted Mr. Punch.
"Just going off, you mean, Sir," replied the Signalman, cheerily.
"Yes, Sir; since the new Act's become law, we have a fair amount
of sleep and work."
"Dear me! Why?"
"Because the Station-master is directly responsible to us, Sir. If
we make any mistake through over-work, we can look to him. But
pardon me, Sir, I have to attend to my discs. A train is just due,
and here it comes, exact to a minute."
"You keep punctual time P"
"We are obliged, Sir, since we are all directly responsible."
Mr. Punch, well pleased with what he had seen and heard, walked
on to the Station. He found its Master smiling.
"Everything right P"
"Everything, thank you. Sir. Now that we have direct personal
responsibility, it's perfectly wonderful how smoothly everything
goes."
"No accidents, eh?"
"Accidents, Sir! Why, we have almost forgotten what they are!
How can we have accidents, when the Traffic-manager is responsible
to the Station-master for the proper timing of all the trains 'f With
punctuality, we know where we are, Sir. Working a line now is as
easy as A B C."
Suddenly Mr. Punch found himself transported to a comfortably
furnished office, in which an Elderly Gentleman was busily engaged
in the direction of a numerous staff of employes.
"Glad to see you, Sir," said the Elderly Gentleman, who immedi-
ately recognised his august visitor; "but I am sure you will pardon
me if I give my undivided attention to the work before me. A
very heavy responsibility sits upon me, Mr. Punch—a very heavy
responsibility indeed."
"And you are not over-worked, Mr. Traffic-manager?"
"Certainly not, Mr. Punch. The Directors are personally
responsible to me. If I were over-worked, they would be the
sufferers. Since the new Act, no one can shirk his duties. And
now good-bye."
Mr. Punch took the hint, and withdrew. Again suddenly he
found himself in another room, in which a number of excited and
portly persons were engaged in a most animated conversation. They
rushed up to Mr. Punch as he entered, and overpowered him with
questions.
"Is the Traffic-manager looking after the trains?" asked one.
"Are the Station-masters telegraphing to the Signalmen?" said
another.
"Are the Guards obeying the signals?" cried a third.
"Are the Engine-drivers looking after the Plate-layers ?" shouted
a fourth.
"Stop, stop!" exclaimed Mr. Punch. "Pray tell me why are
you so interested in these matters?"
"Because," they cried in angry unison, "we are responsible to
everybody—not only to our employes, but to the Public, and the
Law as well. It is shameful, scandalous, disgraceful!"
"I suppose you are"
"Directors!" they shouted. "Fancy making Directors respon-
sible!"
"I suppose the new Act"
But here Mr. Punch was interrupted by an absolute shriek of
rage. The noise (which turned out to be the braying of some
donkeys) woke him, and he found, as he looked once more at the
running river, that the visions he had seen were merely the shadows
of a pleasant dream. May those shadows have coming events to
follow them!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
At Covent Garden Promenade Concerts—The Italian Night —
Obserrations fir any other Night—The real Attraction—A Hit
—A Hint.
SIR.— The motion that
Mr. ARTHUR SULLIVAN
do now leave the Chair
being carried, and that
eminent Composer having
personally, and most suc-
cessfully, conducted the
Concert party so far into
the middle of the Season,
Mr. RIVIERE—the shining
RIVIERE— has taken the
vacant seat, and is giving
us English Nights (this
sounds like our old friends
the men in armour of the
N inth of November), French
Nights (or Bavards), Scot-
tish Nights ((iuentin pur-
wards), Classical Nights
(Agamemnon, Achilles,
Ulysses, & Co.) and many
more very pleasant nights,
judging by the appearance
of the sitting and prome-
nading audience on the
night of my visit, i.e. " the
Italian Night." I selected
the Italian Night because
what can be more beauti-
ful .than an Italian night? At this time of year I believe the
Italian nights are at their best. And then what a real treat in mid-
October, in mid-London, in our very un-Italian climate, to be able
to enjoy a genuine Italian night!
"C'ojfo gentil!" I hummed to myself. I always hum to myself,
first, because 1 like an appreciative audience; and, secondly, because
I have heard myself called a " hummerist," and, of course, one likes
to keep up the character. These reflections are appropriate in the
neighbourhood of Covent Garden as I pass the old "Hummuns,"
celebrated for its Humming Ale.
But to return—An Riviere.
A change has come over the arrangements. The position of the
Chair has been altered. Mr. SULLIVAN used to sit with his back to
the audience. Everyone understood why. Isn't he the composer of
"Looking Sack " f And his taking up that position must have
sent up the sale of that popular song some millions.
But Mons. RIVIERE—who is both a Mont and a Riviere—takes
another view of the situation—a front view. He faces the audience.
Occasionally he descends from his throne, to conduct the Orchestra
from a place near the piano; then he remounts—the Mons re-
mounted—to his seat in the midst of his army of performers, so as
to keep an eye on the Military and the Ladies of the Chorus in the
back rows: the Ladies being a new feature—and some very pretty
features, too—in the programme.
First there was the Overture to "Nabucodonosor "—generally
abbreviated, by his personal friends, to "Nabuco." I know the
Overture, but not the Opera. I suppose the Second Act, if it follows
the story, is entirely pastoral. I don't think you can gather much
of the plot—the grass-plot in the case of poor JVooueo-^from the
Overture. I suppose, by the way, that Nabucodonosor is the Ne-
buchadnezzar with whom " every schoolboy" is well acquainted at a
very early age?
The next item of importance was a Violoncello Solo by M. VAN
Hi F-..VK, who came on first, as the "Van," while Mr. LINDSAY SLOPER
brought up the rear, and accompanied the Fiddling Dutchman on
the piano. The audience were immensely pleased with M. VAN
BIENE, the Double Dutchman, or the Double-Bass Dutchman.
I do like Mr. LINDSAY SLOPER as an accompanyist. He seems so
pleased at being asked. He comes on to the platform with an air of
surprise, as if he had only just arrived to make a friendly coll on Mons.
RIVIERE, who had suddenly jumped up, and said, "My dear SLOPER,
now you are here, do play us an accompaniment." And the amiable
Mr. SLOPER, unable to refuse, had there and then consented, and
had been at once introduced to Mr. VAN BIENE, or Signo UHJO. or
whoever the soloist might be, had said some pleasant and polite
things to him, asked how all the little Vans were at home—VAN
JOHN, VAN TRUMP, VAN-ESSA, &o.—and, on Mons. RIVIERE looking
at his watch, had courteously bowed to the Musical Hollander, and
had accompanied him—on the platform, and on the piano.
Madame LEMMKNB-SHJCHKINOTON'S rendering of "By the Margin of
fair Zurich's Waters " awoke the echoes of applause, and an encore
could not be denied. They would have it—but they didn't—because
when Madame LEMMENS-SHERRINGTON did return, she in effect said,
"I cannot sing the old Song," and sang, instead, "Love teas once a
little Soy," with which the audience were equally pleased.
They were highly delighted, too, with Madame JENNY PRATT'S
"The Lore who sailed away"; and this lady too, being encored,
sang something else.
I retired after the Petit Due had been performed, with which—
the music itself, not its execution—I confess I was disappointed.
All the Petites Ducks of the Ladies' Chorus joined in, and the music
lesson was the best thing of this selection.
The first time these young Ladies rose from their seats was to join,
with much devotion, in the prayer from Mose in Eqitto. A profane
person, without appreciation of anything above the level of a Music-
Hail ditty, wanted to know if the present popular lyric, " Where was
MOSES when the light went out? was taken from this Opera. He
was at once, and properly, rebuked and instructed, by being informed
that the very title of the Opera was an answer to the question,
"Where was MOSES when the light went out?" Where P "In
Egitto."
"What chiefly interested me during the Concert, from the time of
the arrival of the Military Band, was the conduct of one of its mem-
bers, who had been hampered with such a gigantic wind instrument
as contained sufficient brass to have made twenty brazen serpents
for MOSES AND SONS of Israel, when they got into the Desert. j
What an instrument! It went round and round the unhappy
warrior just as you 'd twist a Scotch plaid, and as you might suppose
would be the apparent result, if, in cold weather, a doctor had ordered
a patient, with the smallest circulation in the world, to be fitted up
with hot water pipes outside. I asked an intelligent-looking person
what he thought was the name of this instrument of torture r He
replied that he thought it was a ' Bombardon,' and was generally
plaved by a Bombardier." I fancy my informant was not quite right
in his mind. "Bombardon" is a big name, but not big enough.
"Rhom-Bom-bom-bardon " would be nearer.
I waited nervously, anxiously, for the effect of the first blow.
Had I been at one of the old P. R. matches, with money on it, I
could not have been more excited. I regarded it as a contest
between the Bombardier and the Bombardon. The Bombardier I
knew would give the first blow to the Bombardon—but with what
result? What would the Bombardon do to him, in return P I anti-
cipated a thunderous blast, a hurricane, a gale which would send poor
Bombardier head over heels, twirling in the air over the back rail,
and down among the refreshment-tables.
Dare he give that Bombardon a blow? that was the question. I
watched him closely during the selection from La Traviata. There
were plenty of openings for a bbw, but he didn't come up to the
scratch. Several times I saw him prepare: once to make ready,
twice to prepare—then he licked his lips, as though he relished the
idea in theory, but just as he was putting his mouth to the instru-
ment he thought better of it practically, shook his head, and didn't.
Presently I heard a deep bass note; very deep, very basso, motto
profondo. I turned, expecting to see the Bombardier doing it
gently. No: he was doing it gently—but he was doing nothing at
all, nothing whatever. He was looking about admiringly, and
utterly ignoring the presence of the Bombardon which was coiled
round his body.
The basso profondo note came from a quiet-looking gentleman in
the centre of the orchestra, provided with an instrument that hadn't
got a quarter of the Bombardon's advantages.
Whether the Bombardon was annoyed at this it is impossible to
say, but I fancy the wily Brazen Serpent must have given the Bom-
bardier a squeeze round the ribs, as the next minute I saw him
struggling with it. trying to untwist it, wriggling to get his head out
of its clutches, and so to emancipate himself from its fatal embrace.
It was the Laocoon with the Serpent, without the two young
people; but, a less unhappy coon than Laocoon, he showed himself
a Hercules, for presently the Bombardon lay helpless by his side,
and the Bombardier breathed again freely, victoriously.
But play it he never did—I mean not when I was looking. Was
it a Dummy? If so, it was a Double-Dummy. And let Mons. RIVIERE
take my advice, and not lose the opportunity for advertising such a
trump card as this in his pack :—
"Solo on the Great Double-Dummy every evening by the Bom-
bardier in full uniform. Exciting Struggle !' Blow for Blow'!!
Victory of the British Arms! I!"
Then a song, composed expressly to the air " Rote on, thou Gon-
dolier !" commencing
"Blow on, thou Bombardier!"
Which, needless to say. after this publicity, would draw all London
and all the Country. 0 RIVIERE, there is a current in the affairs of
Concerts, which, it taken advantage of, leads on to fortune. Go on
and prosper, but don't forget the Bombardier.
On rising and leaving, I was glad to see the energetic and polite

button-hole! You don't gather such flowers as those on all haies.
Mr. JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD should send round his electric light to
Covent Garden: they would want something extra brilliant when
there's a Haze in front, were it not that there is nothing foggy, but
just the reverse, about this Mister, not misty, HATES.
I, as Tour Representative, have very fair ground for complaint
about a certain misleading advertisement; and, after this warning,
I do hope that the Gentleman, who, having taken his degree of M.A.

one Representative should instinctively pick out another Representa-
tive. What's the indictment? Le voici! ("Here it is!" —I
translate, in respectful imitation of Mr. GEOHGE A. SALA—new
style—who has lately taken to giving us in brackets " the English
of it" in his capital letters—and they are Capital Letters—headed
"Paris after the Peace.") At the end of the string of London
theatrical advertisements in the D. T.. the Provincial Theatres are
beginning to afficher ("advertise") themselves; and so the first
after the Victoria Theatre is the Theatre Royal, Brighton. There is
no objection to this; Brighton is a suburb of the Metropolis in the
8. C., i. e., South Coast District; and then come the announcements
made by the travelling Stars: Mr. IRVINO with his Bells at Man-
chester; Miss BATEMAN and Mary Warner at Swansea; Mr. J. L.
TooLE as A Fool and his Money, at Liverpool; or, as he might put
it in rhyme—no extra charge—
"Mr. TOOLE
Plays' The Fool
And his Money' at Liverpool."
Then Mr. BARRY SULLIVAN at " all the principal cities of the Empire
to follow "—which advertisement must have been written by a waiter
at a grill-room, who couldn't get " to follow " out of his head; then
Mr. ARTHUR GABNER'S Company at Bristol, with the Play of Stolen
Kisses, or the Reward of Meritt; then Mrs. BITTER BEERE (I beg
her pardon, I mean Mrs. BERNABD BEERE) at Bradford, who gives
us a very full advertisement, to " chronicle small Beere;" and then
Miss GAINSBOROUGH at Bolton (is this a real Gainsborough ?); and
then I come upon three consecutive advertisements of the Canterbury
Theatre of Varieties, setting forth how Miss NELLY POWER and
Mile. BARTOLETTI "excite tumultuous applause;" how the Snow-
ball Ballet is supported by a corps de Snowballets; and how NAPO-
LEON, WELLINGTON, STANLEY (the Dean, or the African Explorer ?),
Sir GABNET WOLSELET, BEACONSFLELD (why not " Lord" BEACONS-
FIELD, if Sir GARNET has his title ?) are impersonated by Messrs.
RUSSELL. GROVER, and OTTLEY in a musical sketch. Now, Sir,
what did I say, and naturally, at once? Why, let me have a
London, Chatham and Dover return; let me be there (at Canterbury)
to-day, and here chez moi (" at home") to-morrowj and I can see
the Cathedral, hear the Anthem in the afternoon, dine at the " Old
Canterbury Pilgrims' Inn," and enjoy the show at the Canterbury
Theatre of Varieties, which till now I had thought was only opened
to "Old Stagers " in the "Canterbury Week.'y Did I not at once
make up a party to do this? Wasn't everything ready for a pil-
grimage to the Canterbury Theatre? And wouldn't we all have
gone there express, and been most fearfully and wonderfully sold,
but for the happy thought of someone who suggested, " Telegraph to
the Manager for tickets." What was the reply? "Theatre
closed."
Suddenly one of the party, quite an inspired person, lifted up his
voice, and observed, that the Canterbury Theatre of Varieties must be
the place with the Sliding Roof, where Plei-na used to be performed.
Then we all exclaimed, in chorus, "Why place that London adver-
tisement so as to make it part and parcel of the Provincial Theatrical
Advertisements, and thus mislead guileless youth?"
We paused for a reply. None came, and we separated. We did
not go and sit under the Sliding Roof; but what we did do you will
probably hear anon from

CIRCULAR NOTES.
(By our Jotter.)
SOME papers are giving
puzzles in French
Grammar. Excellent
practice. At a "French
Bee," the other evening, I
asked what was the French
for the flower called
"Sweet William." A dis-
tinguished Professor, whose
articles in the Athenceum
have attracted the atten-
tion of most of the Euro-
pean savants (someone
translated this "soaps,"
but didn't get a prize),
held up his hand, and de-
manded the parole, which
was instantly accorded.
"The French for ' Sweet
William'" said _ that
learned Professor, "is un-
doubtedly ' Billy doux.'"
He was Knighted on the
spot. If any would-be-
knighted inquirer asks,
"On what spot?" I shall
only reply that this must
remain a mystery, for, as
any billiard-player will inform you, the spot can never be plain.
ARE these correct? If not, why not?
He lived in the Isle of Wight.—// a vecu dans I'huile blanche.
He drove a ball many miles with his bat.—Avec son bailment it
faisait se conduire un bal pour menus milles.
The dog wagged his tail.-—Le chien vagtta sa faille.
Is the following a good translation of the French ?—

INELEGANT EXTRACTS.
Mr. Bull (irritably pushing aside a pile of papers). Well, Mr.
Punch, if I don't see myself as others see me, it is not for want of
opportunity. The process is anything but pleasant; but, as the
poet intimates, I suppose it is profitable.
Mr. Punch. That depends.
Mr. Hull. What do you mean?
Mr. Punch. The utility of a mirror depends upon the accuracy of
its reflections. "Others may not always see us as we are. Hate,
jealousy, prejudice, are media as distorting as self-love and personal
vanity.
Mr. Hull. Well, certainly, regarding: myself as painted in the
foreign papers, I am equally disgusted and perplexed. Whether
the portraits all resemble me, I can't say; they certainly do not re-
semble each other, and only agree in being extremely unflattering.
I appear to be a sort of perfidious Proteus; but my presentations,
though various, are all very objectionable.
Mr. Punch. I presume you have been reading some of the extracts
from foreign prints, with which certain of our own papers have
lately so liberally provided you.
Mr Bull. Precisely.
Mr. Punch. Piquant reading, no doubt. But, of course, you do
not allow these carefully calculated pungencies to poke you up?
Mr. Still. Well—I—ahem!—they are deucedly unpleasant, you
know.
Mr. Punch. Do you think, that adroitly selected excerpts from
the less judicious tirades of certain of our Jingo journalists, would
make the pleasantest reading for a Russian, or even an Austrian, or
German.
Mr. Bull. Well, perhaps not. But who sets any store by such
examples of "unauthorised outrecuidance "—to use one of the Jingo
Journalist's own phrases.
Mr. Punch. Neatly translated, and suggestively commended to
the notice of, say a foreign personage of ardent patriotism, but less
calmly judicial, enlightened, and cosmopolitan, than Mr. BULL. Is it
not just possible that they might be taken as representative of
British opinion, and indicative of British purpose?
Mr. Bull. Humph! I twig, Sir. De te fabulu, eh? You would
imply, that when the Go/us vapours, or the Gazette blusters, it is all
Muscovite Jingoism, and doesn't count?
Mi: Punch. Not too absolute, Mr. BULL! What I mean, is. that
the ex pede Herculem principle is not always a safe one, and that
selected extracts from the hot philippics of irresponsible journalists
may not always give the accurate measure of national opinion and
policy.
Mr. Bull. But straws show which way the wind blows, you
know.
Mr. Punch. Sometimes. But, on the whole, they are perhaps
better indices of eddies and gusts than of set drifts and determined
currents. Keep your eyes open, Mr. BULL, by all means, but look
at the facts all round, and do not pay too much attention to the
paper pellets of angry or interested scribblers. Specimens of foreign
impertinence are continually dished up to you with the sauce
piquante of partisan comment—for a purpose. The British Lion
should not be stirred up by squibs. A policy guided by newspaper
cuttings, or swayed by Inelegant Extracts, might prove but a very
purblind one, Mr. BULL. National Prejudice has as many tongues
as Rumour. Do not let their confused babble bewilder your judg-
ment or thwart your steady purpose. Let the political gnats buzz
noisily against each other; it is for you with a calm and judicial
glance to look beyond and above their ephemeral charivari.

ODE TO THE COMING LIGHT.
A Domestic Dithyrambic. By Mrs. Gingham.
OORAY!
I 'm glad as I have lived to see the day
When them there Gas Directors gets a staggerer.
Which a more stuck-up swaggerer
Than your Gas-man—'cept p'raps your Water-Rater
Ain't to be found in Natur.
But this Electric Light '11 check their capers.
Lor' bless yer, they re a writing to the papers,
Protesting, and pooh-poohing, and explaining,
Trying to show as losing ground means gaining,
And with per-centages theirselves confusing,
All which I must say's mightily amusing
To me.
But 'tain't no good; the Coming Light will come,
You '11 see;
And gas '11 have to go, like ile and taller,
And soon we shall consider it quite rum
That we could do so long with light so yaller,
So guv to flickering spirts and smoky nares,
So dismal, dim, and dingy,
As with this bright Electric Light compares
Like dowdy homespuns agin' shawls from Ingy.
I don't purfess to understand the process—
Which Coils and Carbon-points to me is riddles—
But all I knows is,
I ain't no patience with the indiwiddles,
Greedy monopolists or timorous fogies,
As looks on new inventions as on bogies;
Sich is the parties as would sneer and scoff
At EDISON and that there JABLOCIIKOFF
(I 'ope his name's spelt right—these forren Misters
Goes in for reg'lar twisters!);
But them as knows says there's no call for fright;
That this Electric Light
Is bright,
And white,
Don't give no heat, nor yet no smoke,
Nor nasty sooty fumes as soil and choke.
(Which going now-a-days to a theayter
Is bad as swelterin' in Etny's crater.)
And then the gilt and whitewash, paint and picters!
Well, I do 'ope them nagging contrydictors
As deals in sneers and stricters,
Swearin' the Light's too brilliant, deathly-blue,
Orkurd, expensive, and Old Nick knows what,
Will be proved wrong; drat the cantankerous crew!
I 'd shet np the 'ole lot
Four hours in that there Gallery at the " Folly,"
The gas full on; I 'ope they'd find it jolly.
No; Gas may 'ave its uses still, no doubt;
But them as makes it ain't bin so perlite
That we should fret ourselves for their look-out—
Not quite!
If JABLOCHKOFF, or EDISON, or others,
Can give us better light and fewer bothers,
More wital airs and not no noxius wapors,
In spite of all the croakers in the papers,
I begs to aay, emphatical, So be it!
And may I live to see it!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAE1.
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JACK SPRATTS.
A Tale of Modern Art and Fashion.
PAM VII.
Now, Mr. Punch, who was kept an fait of nil the SPRATTS' doings,
and who had got to take a great interest in these young^ people, began
to opine that their position was growing somewhat perilous, and that
it was high time for him to interfere, like a dens ex machina, before
another London season should wax and wane, when it might per-
haps be too late.
For dreadful things were beginning to be said about Mrs. SPKATT;
much too dreadful to be repeated here!
So he discovered, in the vernal glades of Camden Town, an
American sculptor—one PYGMALION F. MINNOW—whose wife was
ever so much taller, plumper, redder, and whiter than Mrs. SPRATT,
and consequently twice as
beautiful. So beautifid
was she, in fact, that her
husband had made a life-
size statue of her, in illus-
tration of Mr. TENNYSON'S
beautiful poem, The Mer-
maid; and so beautiful
was this statue, that the
Royal Academicians found
a place of honour for it all
by itself (in the refresh-
ment-room).
And so pleased were they
by the singularly modest
and unassuming demeanour
of the sculptor, that, very
much against his will, and
although there was no
vacancy in their ranks,
they elected him full Royal
Academician on the spot,
a thing that had never been
done at Burlington House
before. Poor JACK SPBATT!
Instigated bv3/r. Punch,
that plucky Baronet who
had bought the Little Sock-
Darner, also bought the
Mermaid, for his smoking-
room; and not only that,
but he gave the fortunate
Artist a commission to
execute from the same
model a life-sized statue of
Diana, as she appeared to
the enterprising but ill-
fated Actieon a few mo-
ments before his untimely
death; which work of Art
was intended by thisplucky
Baronet to be a nice little
surprise for his good lady
on her next birthday; and
his good ladv called on the
sculptor and his wife at
the studio, promiscuously,
as she had done on the
SPRATTS, and was so de-
lighted with what she saw there, that she instantly dropped a fair
Ethiopian ventriloquist, who could perform in rive distinct South
African dialects, and took up this young American couple instead,
and invited them to a " small-and-early " at her house m Belgrave
Square.
And there they had a success in the tableau vivant line that com-
pletely eclipsed that of the SPRATTS the year before, and the lovely
GALATEA MINNOW became the fashion more suddenly, if possible,
than Mrs. SPRATT had done. And from that moment Mrs. SPRATT
might consider that her brief reign was over, and that she was for
ever deposed from the throne of beauty.
Not that she abdicated without a struggle. The throne of beauty
is wide enough for two, it seems; and two pretty women sitting
close together, and thus publicly sunning themselves
"In the broad glare that beats upon a throne,"
make a much more edifying sight than only one. But the contest
was soon decided in favour of the sculptor's wife. For although
that omniscient Brother of the Brush (who had asserted that no such
pretty woman as Mrs. SPBATT had been seen for four hundred

1 years) came forward with another assertion, namely, that Mrs.
j SPRATT was anatomically finer than Mrs. MINNOW, and. would make
! a far more perfect skeleton, another lynx-eyed son of Apelles dis-
covered that Mrs. MINNOW'S foot, although larger than Mrs. SPRATT'S,
was constructed on truer artistic principles—more Greek, in fact;
whereas Mrs. SPRATT'S, however fascinating to the Philistines, was
rather Roman than Greek, and belonged to a later and somewhat
degraded period'of Art. So Mrs. MINNOW, with her classical foot,
J won the day, and was the talk of Clubs and dinner-parties through-
| out the length and breadth'of the land; and Mrs. SPRATT and her
tootsicum were nowhere! Sic transit qloria mundi!
"Le reine est mart.' vice le reine!" said his light-hearted old
Grace, the Duke of PKNTONVILLE, who was very proud of his perfect
French; and the mot,
coming from him, made
quite a furore.
JACK was also destined
to be unsuccessful this
year. He had sent eight
life - sized Sock - darners
(with large landscape back-
grounds) to the Royal
Academy, with a short but
perfectly polite note to the
effect th'at he wished them
to be hung all together in
the lar^e room. No. III.,
on the line, with sufficient
space left between them to
prevent their interfering
with each other, and no
other pictures hung above
or below. There was also
a postscript, mildly but
lirmly intimating that if
these conditions were not
complied with to the letter,
he should feel bound for
the future (in justice to
himself) to exhibit his pic-
tures in a private Gallery
of his own, instead of
sending them to the Royal
Academy.
At the same time he
displayed his tact by invit-
ing the ten members of the
Academy Council for the
year to a banquet at Rich-
mond, to meet two Vis-
counts, six Guardsmen,
and an eminent Art-Critic.
Previous engagements, it is
true, prevented the ten
Academicians from accept-
ing this invitation; and as
for the Art-Critic, he never
even answered JACK'S hos-
pitable note. The Viscounts
and Guardsmen alone ac-
cepted; but they never
came.
So that the repast, though a sumptuous, was a lonely one.
Well, to his utter surprise and bitter mortification, the eight Sock-
darners were rejected, without even so much as a line to explain why!
Nor would the dealers, great or small, have anything to do with
those eight great Sock-darners; they had too many of JACK'S wares
on their hands already. Nor would the British Public; not at any
price whatever.
To improve matters, and to pass the time, J. S. took to writing his
views on Academicians, and dealers, and the British Public (and very
strong views they were) in smart little pamphlets which he pub-
lished at his own expense, and very liberally forwarded free of
charge (and without previous application being made for the same).
But the worst was to come. Bad as it was in a financial and
practical sense to be ignored by the Academicians, deserted by the
British Public, and forsaken by the picture-dealers, there yet re-
mained to JACK the gorgeous, gilded, glittering Swells, whose invi-
tations last year had been so plentiful that ne had occasionally
revolted against them, exclaiming, "What nuisances they are,
taking one from one's work, and running after a fellow like this!"
(For although smart people sometimes ask the husband without

the wife, it would hardly do to ask the wife without the husband:
onlv, JACK had never quite seen it in this light.)
But this year, strange to say, not a single invitation for the
SPKATTS from any house really worth going to, was delivered either
hv hand or hy post; and Mrs. SPRATT would read aloud the fashion-
able arrangements for the week, and the week after, and the week
after that; and not a card for any arrangement whatever, even at
the eleventh hour! And even as she read, they groaned in the
spirit together, and dropt the briny tear.
0 ve SPKATTS! did you think it would go on for ever? Know ye
not that all those wallowing sea-monsters of whom you small British
fry are so doatingly fond, can be almost as fickle as yourselves—
as ready to drop new friends for newer, as you are to drop old
friends for them i Alas! pretty faces must not fade, pretty pictures
never fail, and money be always forthcoming, for the likes of you to
swim alongside of these giants of the main! And even if your power
to amuse them gratis were perennial, and you were suffered to live
among them to that end for
ever and a day, you would
still be only SPRATTS! And
the porpoises would only
roll over you, and the
sharks tell you to get out
of the way, for you are not
worth eating up. Even the
great good-natured Whales,
whose eye and smile you
live to catch, would hold
out a fin one day, only to
pass you by the next! And
lord! how yoxir fellow-
SPRATTS would laugh whenl
they heard of it all!
Had you but been a little]
less high and mighty, you
might have commingled
with another kind of fish,
and not a low-class fish
either; and you might have
grown in stature thereby,
and even have acquired
some of their llavour, and
lost some of your own, a
little of which sroes a very
long way! Are there not
the herrings and the mack-
erel? the flounders, the
plaice, and the soles? the
expensive smelt, scarcely
bigger than yourselves, but
oh! how much nicer! the
mullets, red and white, but
especially red! the codfish,
the turbot, the brill, and
the salmon? And last, but
not least, the delicate, nu-
tritious, and easily-digest-
ed Punch? all of which
live to useful ends, that
they may feed and benefit
mankind; and arc the very
salt of the sea!
0 SPBATTS, be wise in
your generation, an ye
would be happy, and live
out your little lives in un-
disturbed self-eomplaceney and mutual admiration among just a
few carefully-selected SPRATTS of your own size!
Indeed, for most of us work-a-day folk, whether we be of the
Spratt, Sole, or Salmon tribe, what is there in all the Hollow World
ol Fashion really worth our stooping to pick it up, beyond the mere
honour and glory of stooping in the midst of our would-be betters P
Truly and well sang the Augustan bard (we quote from memory):
"Oh! quite too fortunate, did they but know
Their own good luck, those Toiler", unto whom,
Far from the madding crowd, kind Fute allots
A red-brick house, well-stocked with china blue,
And trusty friends, and twins; and, crowning all,
A lovely wife, whose beauty doth concern
But one man only, and that man alone!"
(The Italics are ours.)
But we have not yet quite done with the SPRATTS, for whom
poetical justice is duly waiting in our next. »
THE STATE V. SCIENCE.
MR. PUNCH lately questioned the meaning of an order from the
Home Office for the discontinuance of the practice of taking plaster
casts of the heads of condemned criminals as heretofore after death.
Nevertheless, he has received no explanation of that mandate, which
has also puzzled a professional contemporary. The Medical Press
and Circular observes:—
"The object of this decision it is difficult to even guess at. It surely
cannot be to arrest the study of comparative phrenology or craniology. We
are fast drifting into a sentimental cycle in which a false humanity plays too
j important a part. It would not surprise us to hear that a Society was estab-
lished to suppress the practice of dissection, BO that our schools of medicine
would then De rendered virtually uselesi."
The Anti-Vivisectionists, the Anti-Vaecinationists, and the Pecu-
liar People are doubtless inspired with earnest joy and hope by the
anti-scientific action taken
by the HOME SECRETARY
as to the heads of malefac-
tors. They, in concert
with a congenial class of
Clergymen, will perhaps
shortly assemble and meet
together, to vote Mr. CROSS
a testimonial, or get up a
deputation to present him
with an address of thanks
for his official demonstra-
tion of his hostility to
physiological research.
Their numbers will pro-
bably include some of the
Anti-Phrenologists; those
namely, who do not care
whether Phrenology is true
or false. Because if it is
false, though further com-
parison of cerebral con-
formation with character
would only prove the
falsehood of" Phrenology,
it might also prove the
truth of some other account
of the relation between
the brain and the mental
functions; and they wish
for no proof of any such
thing.

Medicinal Mirth.
Dr. DAWSON TURNER, the
other day announced, in a
letter to the Times, that a
previous letter, requesting
the benevolent to send
amusing books to London
Hospitals, had brought him
already " 200 or 250 charm-
ing readable books for the
sick folk, and at least 400
magazines and serials."
Thus physic for the body
is supplemented by medi-
cine for the mind, for
which nothing can be more sanatory than amusing books, magazines,
and serials—especially serials. A generous Public will know how
to adopt a purely benevolent suggestion. The next step will be due
provision by the Hospital Staff for the distribution of this stimu-
lating mental diet among the patients. The books when given must
j not be allowed to moulder unused, still less must they oe surrep-
'titiously got rid of, as waste paper at twopence a pound, as Punch
has heard of their being, by a bitterly pious chaplain and a lot of
like-minded visiting ladies, when the hospital was under repair,
and the eyes of its wiser directors, for a moment, turned away.

GREECE'S LOANS AND GREECE'S LOVERS.
PUNCH, in 1863, printed the following :—
"CON. BY A GREEK BONDHOLDER.
Spell, in five letters, ' Bully, Bilk, and Sneak,
Repudiator, Trickster'—read it, 'Greek.'"
The writer, no doubt, wrote out of the bitterness of his bondage,
and Punch published according to his lights.
But now he feels he owes HELLAS an amende honorable, and it is
with the utmost satisfaction that he pays it. She has offered a com-
position to her creditors, and considering the treatment she met with
from her English friends and lovers some half century ago, quite as
handsome a composition as her bondholders have any right to
expect.
Complete knowledge of the facts and figures connected with the
Greek loans of 1824 and 1825—such as may be gathered from the
Press utterances of that time, reprinted without comment,* no doubt
in explanation of the terms now offered—should satisfy everyone
that the compendious character given in the bondholder's couplet of
1863 might more fairly he applied to the so-called Philhellenes
who " financed " the Greek loans of half a century ago, than to poor
Greece, who incurred the debt but did not receive the money.
The upshot of the Philhellene financing then was that out of nearly
three millions of money nominally subscribed for her, Greece re-
ceived little more than £300,000, and that the balance did not go
into Greek pockets. That dark tale of roguery is a mess of dirt
which Punch does not feel called upon to stir up. Suffice it to say
that it is not Greece that comes worst out of it. Some of the loudest
of her so-called English friends treated her as scurvily then as the
English Government treats her now. Can Ptinch say more? He

is sorry to find that the score of HELLAS against BRITANNIA is so
heavy, and begs to take his hat off to the ill-used little Lady, with
an apology for having printed hard things of her which were not
deserved.
She now offers terms for redemption of her debt, which, under the
circumstances of the case—and of Greece—Punch feels to be fair, if
they should not even be called liberal. If the Greek bondholders
are wise they will take them, and be thankful. May Crete, Thessaly,
and Epirus he soon as well out of Turkish bonds, as HELLAS, if her
present offer be accepted, will be out of English ones.
REAL COULEUR DE ROSE.
No' need to cry " On, STANLEY, on!" Our War Secretary needs
no stirring up. Thus gallantly, in his Blackpool oration, does he
confront facts (see ALEXANDER FORBES's article in the Nineteenth
Century) and fever (see Sir ANTHONY HOME'S reports):—
"He believed there was no reason, despite all the desponding views which
were taken of the position, that that part of the Anglo-Turkish Convention
by which this country administered the island of Cyprus would prove other-
wise than satisfactory, lie did not wish to go into lite military part of thf-
qncstion, but he thought the step they had taken was advisablf, and that it
had been proved to be prudent. A great deal had been said about the illness
and sufl'ering of the troops there; but although there had been illness in the
island, which all must deplore, the authorities who were best qualified to
speajc continued to assure him there was no permanent Hkclilto.nl of this
remaining."
Certainly not. Any more than there is of the troops remaining.
Punch quite agrees with Colonel STANLEY. If one STANLEY has
traversed the darkness of a Continent, here is another who, with no
less courage, "traverses"—in the legal sense—the darkness of an
island—Cyprus, once the chosen abode of the Goddess of Love, now the
head-quarters of the Fiend of Fever. The Colonel's "couleur d« rose"
must be the fastest colour known to the Trade. It defies all the
bitterest water in the well of Truth to wash it out.

The Spectator suggests that the Pashas seeing how

that a charge of atrocities was a new weapon invented in
Europe, and very effectual, and which, therefore, it
behoved them to use. This is really the most rational
explanation of the matter we have met with.

IT having been now settled in principle that satisfaction is to be
given to the European susceptibilities and jealousies legiti-
mately aroused by the appointment of an Englishman to the
control of Egyptian Finance, the following scheme for the
KHEDIVE'S Government has already been forwarded by Mr. Punch
direct to Cairo.
The Egyptian Cabinet shall consist of as many Ministers as there
are states capable of experiencing legitimate "susceptibilities" at
the bare idea of being shut out of it. Should the number of these
exceed the posts to be filled, it shall be the duty of the KHEDIVE not
only to create new departments for the benefit of such surplus Mini-
sters, but also to provide the necessary funds for the binding of
their respective portfolios, their official uniforms, dress boots, poli-
tical education, dinners, travelling expenses, sea-bathing, and opera
stalls—besides their official salaries.
The language used at all meetings of tho Cabinet shall be the old
Upper Nile Coptic, and an Ollendorff's Method of acquiring the
same, together with a Dictionary of the language, so soon as one can
be compiled, shall lie on the Council Table for the benefit of begin-
ners. At the same time, with a view to facilitate the dispatch of
business, it shall not be considered out of order to have recourse to
Spanish, Syriac, Irish, Chinese, Patagonian, Esquimaux, Basque,
Welsh, Dongola, the Deaf and Dumb Alphabet, or any other known
dialect.
As the object of every individual member of the Cabinet will be
not so much to advance the interests of the Egyptian State as to
steal a march on his European and other confreres, he undertakes,
with a view to the more effective carrying out this object
(1) To collect all the offensive stories he can about his colleagues,
and retail them, with a wink, to every Pasha he comes
across;
VOL. LXXT.
(2) From time to time to offer the KHEDIVE "a few millions, for
three months," or more, on his note of hand, from "a friend
in the City "; and
(3) To contribute regularly, in the character of " Our Own Corre-
spondent," all the secrets of the Cabinet to a British provin-
cial paper.
That the KHEDIVE, on his part, may avoid any sort of approach
to a show of favouritism, he shall—
(1) Deliver his speech on the opening of the Chambers in not less
than twelve modern languages, reserving to himself the
privilege of throwing in an Egyptian oath here and there,
as emphasis may require, or irritation suggest;
(2) Never see less than fifteen of his Ministers at a time, and
then only at a bal masque; and
(3) Borrow money in turns, to a handsome figure, from all the
Powers represented in his Cabinet, without invidious
preference.
To indemnify himself for any extra expense that may be entailed
on him by supplying stamped paper and providing for the interest
on such loans, the KHEDIVE shall have the right, from the com-
mencement of March to the end of October (New and Old Style),
inclusive, to select from his Ministers as many Elevens as he can
get together, and despatch them all over Europe, Asia, Africa,
America, and Australia, arranging cricket-matches, of the gate-
money whereof he is to be entitled to two-fifths, together with a
bonus of ten per cent, on the gross receipts.
Should the financial results of such an enterprise prove disap-
pointing, he shall have the power of negotiating with Messrs.
MASKELYNE AND COOK, for his own appearance with the whole of his
Ministry in a new series of Cabinet Tricks at the Egyptian Hall,
Piccadilly.
Should the above scheme fail to satisfy the "susceptibilities" of
Europe, the KHEDIVE can always fall back upon Mr. Punch, who
will be most happy to suggest some other plan to help him out of
his difficulty.

BUT HOW LONG WILL THE GAME LAST <
CKIMSON SCALPS!
DON'T be afraid—it is not a Cheyenne tale of horror that Punch
is about to write. It is no new thing to have a lady's head running
on caps and bonnets, feathers, flowers, and fal-lals. But it is a new
thing to hear of a lady's caps and bonnets, nowers, feathers, and
fal-lals running on her head, with the ugly result of "covering
the scalp with bright «rimson or magenta blotches."
Such, it seems, has been the disagreeable consequence of wearing
caps and bonnets decorated with the artificial grasses dyed black and
bronze, now so fashionable. "Some of the most brilliant aniline
colours," we are told by Mr. BERNARD DYER (appropriate name!),
Member of the Society of Public Analysts (in a letter to the Times
of Friday, Oct. 18th), "may be obtained by merely rubbing some of
these sombre-looking dyed grasses on a slightly moistened surface;
and the stains of the dye are difficult to remove from th* skin, or
elsewhere."
"Serves anybody right," some cynic may say, "who has the bad
taste to wear grasses dyed black and bronze." The crimson colour,
Punch may add, was communicated to the finger-tips and nails of
this luckless lady, who, in the night, had scratched her irritated
scalp. No wonder her head and hands blushed for her!
All the same, Punch may save some of his fair and foolish corre-
spondents from a disagreeable experience by giving wider publicity
to this new danger hanging over their heads, if they insist on trying
"the hazard of the dye"—unless, indeed, crimson scalp-locks
become the fashion, when, no doubt, they will be voted awfully
becoming.

THE RISE AND FALL OF THE JACK SPRATTS.
A Tale of Modern Art and Fashion.

PAET VIII.
WE -will not follow Mrs. SPBATT through all the steps of her
downward social career, nor describe how she, who had seen Dukes.
Ambassadors, and Princes at her feet, had for a time to condescend
to grovelling Hqnourables, and fall back on Baronets again, and even
put up with Knights from the City: how she rouged, and blanched,
and violet-powdered, and blackened her under-lids, and auricoma'd
and soda'd ner beautiful black hair till half of it turned red, and
the rest fell off; how she dressed more extravagantly than ever,
and became extremely High Church, and sat in tableaux vivants,
held stalls at fashionable bazaars, sang OFFENBACH and LECOCQ at
private theatricals, with short skirts on, &c., &c.
Even the Knights and Baronets failed her at last, and their dames
ignored.
For some little while longer the would-be fashionable people—the
hangers-on at the tail-end of Society, who had not yet received the
straight tip about the sculptor's wife, or couldn't get her—would
still ask Mrs. SPRATT, in spite of the snubs she had showered on
them the preceding year. And much as she sickened at the contact
of their vulgarity—for what can be more vulgar than second or
third-rate people of fashion ?—she was glad of their countenance as
long as it lasted. But even this was withdrawn in time, and she
fell out of the hollow world of fashion altogether. The hollow
world had grown sick of the SPBATTS, and dropped them—beauty,
genius, sock-darning, and all!
And you may be sure that, warned by Mr. Punch, Poetical Justice
was at hand, with scales inexorably poised, and sword on high!
And heavily did she smite them as they fell; and thus ran her
decrees:—
Firstly,—That JOHN SPEATT should become a bankrupt—which
he did. And straightway that beautiful old red-brick dwelling,
where they had lived since they were first married, and might have
lived happily ever after, was placarded all over with unsightly
bills, and defiled from garret to basement by the muddy hoof of
the ubiquitous Hebrew broker; and all their household gods
were bared to the vulgar gaze; and every stick of their quaint old
furniture was sold under the hammer, without reserve; and not a
wrack was left behind to tell the wretched tale of ruin, except ei|fht
huge, frameless, staring Sock-darners, which nobody could be in-
duced to buy, nor even take away for the sake of the canvass on
which they were painted.
Secondly,—That the said JOHN SPBATT be written down a FOOL, so
that his fame as such should reach the uttermost ends of the earth,
and endure thereon so long as the English tongue be spoken.
And, straightway. Mr. Punch took up his pencil and his pen, and
wrote the story of the said JOHN SPEATT, and stamped the likeness
of the same in ink that cannot fade.
"And think thyself lucky, thou miserable SPEATT," exclaimed
P. J. in her sternest accents, "that thy name should go down to
endless posterity uncoupled with a still more disgraceful epithet!"
"Hear! hear!" shouted Mr. P.
"Silence!!" vociferated P. J.
Thirdly, and lastly—(and here P. J. frowned ominously through
the bandage that veils her impartial eyes)—That Mrs. JOHN SPBATT,
wife of the above, and mother of his children But what is this?
Oh! Woman, lovely Woman! ever since Troy became a heap of ashes
(and even before!) what evil hast thou left unwrought, what wild and
wicked things have not been done for thy sweet beauty's sake? And
yet oh! to what base weakness hast thou brought the hearts of the
sons of men, that even at the bare thought of thee crouching in
shame and terror, and bathed in tears, the righteously indignant,
but alas! too susceptible Punch should falter in his just intent, and
be foiled of his own set purpose at the eleventh hour!
For lo! he sinks him on his bended knee, and respectfully ventures
to intercede on behalf of his most unhappy young friend, Mrs. JOHN
SPEATT; he pleads her youth, her inexperience, the blindness of a
silly, fatuous husband, the glittering baits and lures of a heartless,
hollow world. He furthermore points out that the natural conse-
quences of such a career as hers, if duly set forth, would quite too
awfully harrow his gentle readers' feelings, and might very possibly,
moreover, prove unfit for publication in his light and innocent page!
And behold! the generous plea prevails, and Poetical Justice, that
greatest of all the Great Unpaid, tempers herself with mercy, and
"sheathes her flaming brand 1"
******
The SPRATTS are now comfortably settled at Acacia Lodge, a trim,
well-built modern suburban residence, semi-detached, with gas
and water laid on, TOBIN'S ventilators, MOBRIS'S papers, bath-room,
scullery, lawn, summer-house, and all the latest improvements!

[OCTOBER 26, 1878.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Truly, our heaviest troubles are often our best friends, and we
ought to make a good deal more of them than we generally do. At
all events, JACK'S failure proved a very good friend to JACK; for it
not only brought home to him, before it was too late, the fact that
he was no genius, and that his early success had been a fluke, and
that his twopenny-halfpenny Art was but " the milder echo of an
echo mild;" but it also brought his grandfather to his side again,
and the fatted calf was killed, and the reconciliation complete.
Now, this facetious old Philistine, who was over ninety, had taken
it into his head that his was a critical time of life, and that he
required, for a few years at least, some rest from the cares of his
trade; and it was arranged that the emporium in St. Mary Axe (a
very genteel and snug little business) should be managed by JACK,
whose property it would eventually become; and that SPRATT Senior
should spend the remaii;:kr nf his days in peice under the same roof
as his grand- and great-grandchildren, and be the object of their
loving care as long as it should please Heaven to spare him.
Mrs. SPRATT, a wiser, if not a sadder woman, is once more the
brightest ornament of her home; her locks have grown again in
all their sable splendour, the roses and lilies are blooming once more
in her cheeks, and she is as plump and hearty as when she used
to darn the family socks, ever so many months ago. It is once more
to darn the family socks (she says) that she has given up the hollow
world; but this must be taken figuratively, for there is always an
unlimited supply of those useful articles from St. Mary Axe.
She has exchanged her spinning-wheel for a sewing-machine, and
her skipping-rope for a lawn-tennis racket, which she plies with
unerring grace and precision. And if she still reads the old tales of
chivalry aloud, it is only for the benefit of the twins, who are just
rising five, and therefore of an age most keenly to appreciate those
beautiful legends.
She dresses just like any of her neighbours, only better, and her
stately beauty is much admired. Indeed, when she walks (no longer
mobbed) with her ruddy children (no longer quaint and old-fashioned)
in the Zoological Gardens, and SPRATT Senior, that nice, clean, re-
spectable old gentleman, leaning on her arm, they form a picture of
English middle-class domestic felicity which it does the intelligent
foreigner good to see.
She never alludes to the hollow world but to speak of the folly of
its men and the vanity of its women in terms of scorn and detes-
tation, untinged, let us hope, with either envy or regret; and if she
does take in the fashionable prints, it is only for the sake of their
political opinions, and the graces of their literary style.
And she has always a bright smile for JACK when he comes home
from business; and he is never without some elegant little article in
the way of underclothing, bright-coloured and of delicate texture,
either for the twins or herself.
Finally, she has returned to the simple faith of her forefathers,
and worships at Eyre Chapel, near the Ebenezer Arms.
And the trusty friends f
Well, they have come back to the arms of SPRATT, as true and as
trusty as ever, but in different guise.
Disgusted at never finding a publisher, and to revenge himself on
the world for its neglect, PETER LEONARDO Prs has forsworn the
Muse, and is now travelling for his father's firm. He has hardly as
yet acquired that ready smartness so useful in such an occupation,
but is much improved in health and appearance, dresses better,
and, though somewhat reserved and dreamy, is not unpopular " on
the road ;" and Mr. Punch more than suspects that his facility for
writing verse has been turned to account in certain widely-circulated
panegyrics of PTE AND SON'S masculine head-gear, unequalled for
taste, cheapness, and durability; as Mr. Punch can gratefully
testify, having dealt there himself.
And so with the rest of these trusty friends; for they can get no
churches to build, no editors to take their aesthetic essays, no pub-
lishers to print their poems. And, by some strange fatality, the
doors of the Royal Academy, and of the Grosvenor Gallery, and,
indeed, of all the Galleries. British or foreign (especially foreign),
seem inexorably closed to their productions. And having been led
thereby, and also by the persistent gnawing of their empty stomachs,
to the conviction that it is ever the fate of genius to starve, while
mediocrity battens on the fat of the land, they have very sensibly
cut the Fine Arts, and taken to commercial pursuits instead; and
they are doing uncommonly well.
They have also clipped their hair and beards, and they get their
boots and clothes at first-rate West-End establishments, and their
gloves and scarves at SPRATT'S (cost price), and their hats atPrE's—
like Mr. Punch.
And they can smoke their pipes and cigars, the rogues, and toss
off their brandies and sodas, and their claret cups, and their pale dry
sherries; and even roar at the endless buffooneries of SPRATT Senior
(whom they have learnt to love), in spite of the death of the grand
Old Masters. And they are always welcome at "Acacia Lodge"
as flowers in May, for whatever we may think of their genius, their
unsophisticated hearts are fond and faithful, warm and true.
And who so fit to appreciate these qualities, and hold them dear
and sacred, as those storm-tossed victims of the hollow world's
caprice, Mr. and Mrs. JACK SPRATT?
And now, virtuous Header, having relieved thy anxiety as to the
fate of that worthy but once misguided pair, and steered them safe
and sound into such a haven of respectability as, surely, was never
reached by such perilous straits before (and probably never will
be again), he will leave this tale to work its own moral in thy
thoughtful bosom, and bid thee farewell for the present; for he has
other business on hand, seeing that the sculptor s wife is giving the
sculptor, and Mr. Punch, and the Duke of PEXTONVJLLE, and, eke
the Duchess thereof, and a good many more people besides, a great
deal of unnecessary trouble!
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
A Word about Licensing—a Visit to the Oxford—a look in at the
Rot/altt/, Strand, and Fully—and a look out for the future.
E has been some talk
lately about what sort of
plays the LORD CHAMBER-
LAIN ought, or ought not,
to license. Knowing that
the line must be drawn
•iomewhere, let him draw
it tightly, boldly, fear-
lessly, and absolutely
refuse to give his reasons
for so doing. Let him be
thorough, and not earn
the title of Lord Half-
and-Half-ford. As the
Office exists, let the
Officer do his duty.
Whether there is any
necessity for the Office
itself, is a question
which would probably be
answered, in the affirma-
tive, by a considerable
majority.
The eminent adapter of
Les Lionnes Pauvres in
his calmer moments, when
alone in his conservatory
watching his "growing
dramatic reputation,
will probably be grateful
to the Licenser for hav-
ing exercised a wise dis-
cretion in his behalf.
I can imagine, as a
fancy sketch, the Licenser
out early in the morning
"exercising his discre-
tion," and just nodding
over the wall, as he trots
by Mr. MATHISON'S house, and asking him in a friendly way. "how
his growing dramatic reputation is getting on?" All a-blowing,
all a-growing? Wasn't there a nigger tune some years ago called
"O Billy Pattison!" Its rhythm and tune are appropriate:—
"W hv such a play to adapt did you choote?
6 ARTHUR MATHISOK!
'Which Mr. CENSOR wa« bound to refuse '(
0 ARTHUR MATHISON!
But does this line, drawn by the LORD CHAMBERLAIN, extend to
the Tight and Slack Rope, to the perilous acrobatic performances
that are so often the great attraction at the Music-Hails?
For example, as Your Representative, Sir—as the Representative
of Lord Chamberlain Punch—than whom no better Censor Morum
exists—I visited the Oxford Music-Hall. It was crowded. The
Stalls are more uncomfortable than at any other place of amusement
I can just now call to mind. The stall-audience was much the same
as all such audiences usually are, and—what invariably astonishes
me at these places—the proportion of thoroughly respectable-looking
women, with the comfortable air of well-to-do lodging-house keepers
of the Bloomsbury Division, was really remarkalble, reminding me
much of a German audience, where a whole f amily take a table, in
some festive entertainment of singing and music, and remain at it
for hours, with the accompaniment of mild beer in long glasses,
cigars at five for twopence, a hunk of bread, and some slices of milk-
white veal. The very swell fast element does not seem to enter
into the composition of an Oxford Music-Hall, to any appreciable
extent.
I insist upon the respectability of the audience, as showing

what such an audience will enjoy in the way of—Heaven save the
mark! — amusement. I pass over the Japonorecelrie, with its
untidy-looking boys, shrill-voiced singing infant phenomenon, and
over-rouged dancers, who skipped neatly—this being the best part
of the performance, though a trifle stale by now; and of what pre-
ceded this wearisome stun I am ignorant, but it was followed by
some comic songs from the Oxford favourite, Mr. ABTHUB ROBERTS—
I beg his pardon, there is no "Mister" on the bills—he is familiarly
known as "ABTHUR ROBEHTS "—who is undoubtedly clever in his
line, but who, at this moment, except a topical song (words by a
namesake of the Archbishop ot YOBK), with the refrain "More or
less," has little much worth! hearing; and then, after the Brothers
HULINE had tried to amuse us by gymnastic fiddling not at all new,
and had really surprised us by their marvellous adroitness in hat-
catching, the feature of the evening was announced, namely,
"LEONA-DARE, QUEEN OF THE ANTILLES."
I do not know what " The Antilles " are doing in the absence of
their Queen, or whether Her Majesty, having been deposed from
that high position—(she could, I fancy, be deposed from any high
position, and bet three to one on her coming down safely—like a
oat)—is now reduced to earning an honest livelihood by showing
what an Ex-Sovereign can do, when she is not fettered by the strict
ceremonial and rigidly formal etiquette of a Court. The " Ciueen of
the Antilles" has evidently discarded her regal robes, unless the
acrobatic costume in which she appears is the Court-dress of the
Mantilles. She enters, first of all, in a sort of thin wrapper, strikes
an attitude—perhaps as "Queen of the Antilles" receiving the
Antillesian nobility—and then dashes aside the flimsy robe, as
though it were a bathing-dress, and she were going to take a plunge.
How do the nobility and courtiers of the Antilles act on such a
trying occasion? Do they put their hands up to their faces and
turn away? or do they at once hand her the trapeze, or the rope,
or the bar, or whatever it may be? I fancy so, as Her Majesty is
accompanied by a small wiry man, attired similarly to herself, who
seems to know what Her Majesty likes, and what she wants. And
what is this poor man's reward? Why, after he has served her
faithfully for over a quarter of an hour, throwing her ropea, tighten-
ing cords, seeing that
everything is right, and
finally devoting himself,
recklessly, to her service,
by loyally flinging himself
from a giddy neight, and
joining her on a trape'ze-
bar. where they sit to-
gether,—she dignified as
a Queen of the Antilles
should be, he proud as a
subject might well be at
being raised to such an
eminence by his own
merits and by the com-
mand of his Royal mis-
tress, and willing to obey
her lightest word—he is
suddenly deposed — poor
favourite, and with a ring
in his waistband that is
linked to a ring which
Her Majesty, now in a
down - flying attitude,
holds in her mouth, be-
tween her teeth—and
thus this poor unhappy
Prime Minister (or what-
ever he is) is suspended
from his office by the
Queen of the Antilles.
Then she slaps him,
slaps him hard and fre-
quently, and he being
thus suspended, is sent
round spinning like a
whipping-top, until so
*as*: *n" furious are his
gyrations, that I could
not tell what he had
become—a man or a crab, a human being or a shapeless dummy.
At last that merciless, capricious Queen of the Antilles releases
her victim, and once more allows him to resume his seat on the bar,
where he appears dazed, bewildered, while she looks cruelly and
maliciously nante. (By the way, this was good acting on the part
of both performers, and looked uncommonly real.)
"What was this man—her courtier, her slave, her servant'(
From his conSection with the bar, perhaps a Q.C.—a Queen's
Counsel—of the Antilles. Not a Judge, surely?

But suppose he were found to "be the Lord Chamberlain at the
Court of the Antilles, on a tour through Europe with the Queen?
On a tour, and taking several " turns" nightly.
If so, would it not be well if, out of mere fraternal feeling, our
LOBD CHAMBERLAIN, or his Representative, were just to drop in to
the Oxford, and see this performance? There is nothing to save this
man from coming crash smash on to the Oxford stage. No net. The
net is there at an earlier part of the show, but is withdrawn before
the Queen takes it into her head to give her Prime Minister (or what-
ever he may be) an extra turn.
And what attraction has this entertainment for the respectable
stall-audience I have already mentioned? Why, I honestlybelieve,
simply, its peril, nothing else.
Why not have a strong swinging net beneath, during the whole
performance; so that, come what come may, nothing more serious
than a shaking can occur?
The Queen of the Antilles is a fine, handsome, graceful Lady, and
her subjects would be really grieved if anything were to happen to
her. But what can she expect, when she herself patronises her
Prime Minister, or favourite Courtier, and makes him a helpless
Revolutionist?
After this I left. Perhaps, not being an Oxford man myself, I
have no great sympathy with their special amusements. But is this
really the way they go on in the Sheldonian? I trust not. If so,
they manage these things better at Cambridge. I should recom-
mend Our Censor to pay a visit to the American Bar at the tavern
dedicated to the Horse Shoe (from the custom here of paying " on
the nail"), and getting someone to treat him to an " Eye Opener."
The other evening I went to see La Jolie Parfumeuse. For a piece
got up in a hurry, because there was that disappointment about
Niniche, it was very creditably put on the stage. Mr. H. J. BYRON
did a version some time ago for the Alhambra, and I fancy I recog-
nised some of his fun in the Third Act of this version, which is
announced as by CHARLES LAMB KENNY. Perhaps in the hurry
the two versions have got mixed. Miss SANTLEY sings the song
of the Second Act (I forget its name) capitally, and wins the
encore! But, beyond this, there is not much in it. There was
a good deal in it at the Bouffes, where I first saw it, and DAUBBAY
and THEO were very funny. But it is peculiarly Parisian, and
wants both the Parisian acting and the Parisian audience. There is
little for anyone to do except the Low Comedian.
By the way, what a pretty little house the Royalty is now. What
a difference from the old uncomfortable dingy theatre, when all the
brightness was on the stage. Oddly enough, as long as that theatre
was dingy and uncomfortable, it was generally crowded, and cer-
tainly during that time of grubbiness it made its biggest successes.
Miss Pretty <S'e«tsan-OLlvER will pardon me if I remind her that it
was grubby.
But directly it was " done up "—it was done up, with a vengeance,
and took a long time to recover itself, and get accustomed to its new
dress. It "s as pretty and pleasant a little house for a light enter-
tainment as any in London, and. with careful management, ought
to have "the old times revived. Soit! How about the Electric
Light here? Just to show the way?
At the Strand, Our Club, which begins at seven and ends at nine,
is capitally played all round, and the author may say this much and
be thankful, and Mr. FARNIE'S Nemesis, which begins at 9'15, and
plays till eleven, is, with Messrs. MARIUS AND Cox, clever Miss
LOTTIE VENN, and the new attraction, Miss VIOLET CAMERON, as
amusing as ever it was in the principal situations, though Mr.
LOBEDAN is scarcely an equivalent for Mr. EDWABD TEBRY; being
too much of the regular tenor, and too little of the low comedian.
The piece has yet to be seen by a new set of playgoers, who are at
least four years older than when it was first produced, and four
years do make a considerable difference to some very young folks.
Tantalus, at the Folly, is a new version of a farcical French piece
(Une Bmte a Bibfj produced at this theatre last Christmas. The
present oast is an improvement on the previous one; and Miss LYDIA
THOMPSON has a part in it, with which she can do something more
than it was even in her power to do with her rSle in Stars and
Garters.
So much for the "Looks in." We areto "lookout" for Mr. IRVING
at the Lyceum, with Miss ELLEN TEBBY for Ophelia; for Mr.
PHELPS, as Cardinal Wolaey, at Drury Lane; for the reopening of
the St. James's, for the revivification of Sadler's Wells by Manageress
Mrs. BATEMAN, who despises the old proverb about " Leaving Wells
alone "—and unless Mr. J. L. TOOLE is made President of the Royal
Academy, or Mr. CHATTERTON Archbishop of CANTERBURY, vice Dr.
TAIT, resigned, I am not aware that there is anything else for you to
hear from

Of the Kindly glare from the lighthouse height,

That Gas Shares must come down like a stove-in kite,
That light is darkness, and black is white.
Cease, fools, your brainless heads to smite

To be stayed by fear of your hopeless fight.

With its lightning flash bringing day into night,
Will prove a blessing, and not a blight.

Too much to be gulped in a Stock-Exchange bite:

Hold to your Gas Shares tough and tight,
And you '11 find that things will work themselves right,
Nor knock out your brains on the Edison Light.

the Almighty Dollar.
At the same moment we read of a Company being formed to utilise
this "almighty water-power " for the compression of air to be trans-

Y DEAREST BLANCHE,
WHEN I wrote to
you a few weeks ago,
you may remember I told
you all about France, Ger-
many, Switzerland, and
Italy. I asked you to
answer my letter, and you
(naughty girl!) have done
nothing of the sort. You
may say that I gave you
no address. But, my dear
child, be sensible. How
could I? EDWIN and I
have been here, there, and
everywhere, and it would
have been useless to have
told you to write to one
place when the chances
were that we should have
been "over the hills and
far away" long before
your letter could have
reached us. However, I
bear no malice; and to
show you I can return
good for evil, I send you
another letter describing
the Paris Exhibition.
In the course of our travels we found ourselves at Dinan (you
know, the town near Dinard, not the place in Belgium), and as the
direct way home was bj; a dreadful long sea-passage from St. Malo
to Southampton, we decided upon going to Paris once more, to get
within reach of the Calais-Dovvres. And so we came here about a
week ago, and here we have been ever since. EDWIN says that the
prices are simply enormous. I should not mind this so much if there
were any new bonnets in the shop-windows. But, my dear, I can
assure you that they have only got last year's shapes. You remem-
ber that toque I bought last October at Boulogne, and wouldn't have
trimmed because I did not care for it. Well, my dear, I saw one
just like it, ticketed a novelty, in the Rue de la Paix! Only think
of that! EDWIN said he never enjoyed shopping so much before.
Stingy fellow! It was because I could find no excuse for buying
anything!
And now, darling, let me tell you all about the Exhibition. I
know you like to have your mind improved; and, without conceit,
I think I may say that you will find this letter instructive. Poor
dear! Fancy, not being able to get away from home! I do so pity
you!
Well, dear, we got up early on the morning after our arrival, and
took a course to the Champs de Mars. EDWIN bought two tickets at
one place, had them clipped at another, and gave them up at a third,
and then we were allowed to pass in. Dear fellow! he insisted upon
my taking a seat in a sort of thing that looked like something
between a skeleton Bath-chair and an overgrown perambulator.
This conveyance was pushed along by a man dressed in a uniform
which seemed to be made of the same stuff that they use here to cover
pillows and mattresses. I selected the man out of a crowd—such a
nice fatherly person, with white hair and moustaches, and blue
spectacles. He had such a beautiful smile, too, which EDWIN said
was "childlike and bland," when he came to settle with him.
EDWIN said that the chairman's watch was "out and away "the
most wonderful thing in the Exhibition. It gained at least twenty
minutes in every hour; and as you pay for a chair by the hour, I
have no doubt that this watch was very useful to tne poor man.
Although I liked being drawn about very much. I am sorry to say
that the conveyance, as a way of seeing the show, was rather a
failure. EDWIN, in his impulsive manner, told the man to take us
to see the best things. Upon this, the chairman, with his beauti-
ful smile, leisurely carried us off to look at a .large piece 'of stone,
a summer-house, a windmill which seemed to be working a pump,
and a flag-staff. As the careful examination of these objects re-
commended by our guide consumed a very considerable time, EDWIW
dismissed the chairman, and we passed the rest of the day on foot.
I did not regret this so very much, when I found that the chairs
were not admitted to the Fine Art Galleries, and were voted a
decided nuisance by pedestrians everywhere else. I was quite
pleased that EDWIN could not speak French when I heard what
he said when he felt the chair-wheels passing over his feet. His
remarks were really too dreadful.
And now, love, let me tell you all about the Exhibition. The
.moment we got in I said, "Oh! isn't it like the Crystal Palace
Bazaar in Oxford Street!" And so it is, dear, only .of course, very
much bigger. We went first to look at the Prince of WALES's Indian
Presents, which you remember you and I saw at the South Kensing-
ton Museum last year. We were so pleased to see them again.
Then we "did" the British Department, and it was so nice. It was
just like being back again in Bond Street or Piccadilly. We were
so delighted at seeing the dear old 'London names and addresses.
Then we strolled into the Fine Arts Gallery, and saw some of the
paintings we had noticed for ever so many exhibitions of the Royal
Academy. So nice. Mr. COPE and several other eminent R.A.'s
have large and beautiful pictures on the line. Only I did not see
anything of Mr. SOLOMON HART'S. Then we went to an English
Restaurant, and had a mutton chop and a bottle of BASS'S Pale
Ale. So interesting! We were so delighted with everything.
After lunch, EDWIN met an old friend of his who lives in Paris,
who told him that the British Department was the best thing in the
Exhibition, and that when he had seen that he had seen everything.
I quite agree with him. In duty bound we "did" the rest of the
place, but it was rather stupid. The Trocadero contains a sort of
weak imitation of the South Kensington Museum; and the Foreign
Courts, and the Machinery, and all those sorts of things, of course
we had seen years ago in London, Vienna, and in former Expositions
at Paris. But the Prince of WALBS'S apartments were too lovely!
We got a ticket of admission, and were delighted with them. So
aesthetic and so English! We saw a funny piano, too, that.sounded
(EDWIN said) lie "a lot of poodles with a cold." What
comical effects clever Mr. GEORSE GHOSSMITH, Junior (you remember
we met him last season at Lady CACKLETON'S) could get out of one!
And now, darling, having told you all about the Exhibition, I
must bring my letter to a conclusion, the more especially as we are
going to dme at a place with a thoroughly English name—I mean
the Restaurant du High Life, in the Avenue de 1'Opera.
Ever, dearest, yours most affectionately,
ANGELINA.
P.S.—I have forgotten to say that really the best things in the
Exhibition are some boot-heels in the Hungarian Court. They are
quite too awfully lovely!
PUNCH STANDS CORRECTED.
DEAB MR. PUNCH,
Yorm sentiments on Railway work and responsibility are
entirely right, but the way you illustrate them is altogether wrong.
For instance, Station-Masters don't telegraph to Signalmen. When
a man is just under or over your nsse—as the case may be—that is
unnecessary. Perhaps once or twice a day a Station-Master may
have to shout to a Signalman, or, at a big Station, send a boy to him
with a message, but Signalmen are telegraphing to one another all
day and night long.
Then, again, if Railway working depended on Guards obeying
signals, we should be in a muddle. Why, I 've known a Guard sleep
for five mortal hours on end, from Garngabber to Whitrope Tunnel,
and nobody a whit the worse. If we can get them to hear the
Driver's whistle (you know what a faint sound it is!) and put the
brake on, we consider ourselves lucky. No; it is the Drivers that
obey the signals, under a code more severe, and infinitely more
summary, than that of DEACO.
Then you talk of Drivers looking after Plate-layers! Why, if that
were the rule, traffic in day-time would have to be nearly suspended.
No; the navvies have to make ready the way for the engine, and,
in spite of all unpunctuality, "Don't delay the traffic," is the car-
dinal maxim of all classes and conditions of railway servants.
There can be no doubt, that when Directors so pull the purse-
strings that the permanent way is starved, and trains run off metals
resembling crooked rams' horns and cows' tails mixed and laid in
rows, a winter or two at Dartmoor would be found beneficial, if not
to their constitutions, to that of their line, iron as it may be. The
same remedy might be usefully tried on Traffic-Managers who ap-
point raw bumpkins as signalmen at complex and unlocked"
junctions.
And now, if you please, I '11 shut off steam, for "Drivers must ap-
proach this junction cautiously, and have their trains thoroughly
under command." (Quotation from the Anywhere and Everywhere
Railway Rule Book). Hullo—wonder if that Guard will hear my
whistle"? No! Yours,
AN OLD DRIVER.
A Gregarious Fowl.
IT appears that German Socialism has a Right and a Left Wing.
What shall we call the bird thus typified? Socialism has been put
forth by some of its apostles as an Eagle, by others as a Swan, but in
so far as it has been tried it seems to have occasionally turned out a
Vulture, but has often, and indeed as a rule, approved itself a Goose.

"Lord DUFFERIN'S parting suggestion to his friends in Ontario, with
respect to the Falls of Niagara, deserves the attention of the two groat Com-
munities between whom the Cataract thunders. . . . The land about the
Falls has been parcelled out, and a price is set on the privilege of admission
to every favoured spot. . . . Half dollars and quarter dollars are demanded
on every side. . . . Lord DUPFERIN' s proposal is to make an International
Park about Niagara."—The Times.
How does the Water come down at Niagara?
The answer one gets is a regular staggerer.
(The words are not antiphonetic precisely.
But humour them kindly, and then they 11 do nicely.)
Here it comes watched o'er, and there it comes warded,
Railed in, and paled in, and hoarded, and boarded;
Its points of view parcelled by touters find wardens,
As though it were Shanklin or Rosherville Gardens.
On each bank, hill, or isle is an ogre who collars,
As showman or tollman, the traveller's dollars.
Where loud it comes tumbling,
The Visitor "s fumbling
In pocket or purse for the lucre, and grumbling;
Where swift it comes rolling,
He pays, scarce controlling
His angry disgust at such tithing and tolling.
His choler at each fresh extortion still waxing,
He swears that the beauties of Nature thus taxing
Is Cockneyish greed that esteems it a duty
The Sublime to sack-dollar"ge, and Barnumise Beauty,
And Punch cannot wonder,
If when the Fall's thunder,
And the glories around, and above it, and under,
Are made a mere pretext for impudent plunder,
And a man, be he English, Canadian, or Yankee,
Is told by vile hucksters, unblushing and frank, he
Must pay for each peep, he should answer, "No, thankee!'
It puts wholly to flight
One's most subtle delight
In splendours of Nature most mighty and rare, if
They 're rented for peepshows and ruled by a tariff.
It concerns the repute of two spirited Nations
To stop these impertinent appropriations.
Punch seconds Lord DUFFEKIN'S parting suggestion.
Buv out the riparian Goths without question .
And let the Great Cataract tumble untolled,
One of Nature's free sights for all men to behold.
Away with each Showman, each fee-grabbing Shark!
And for the proposed International Park,
If there's no other way
To give Nature fair play,
Why. it's better than low Showman-tricks, any day,
That Yank and Canadian should both in this matter act,
And rescue from BAHNUM their glorious Cataract!

depressionvin trade, failures of banks and
firms, War and increased Income-tax,
looming nearer and nearer. Such things,
however, are bearable; but I was knocked
over this morning when I read in the news-
paper placards—"The Electric Light in
Chancery "!
We lawyers have never been afraid of
the clamour for Law Reform. It is a safe
cry, and a "far cry," as the Highlander
would say. In fact, we don't care how
much Jony BULL'S eye is turned on the
Law and its practices. It is not so likely to
guide as to dazzle those who try to follow
its lead. But once get the Electric Light in
Chancery, and we ARE ruined.
Yours, in despair,
A LAWYER.
A LAST WORD TO WHALLEY.
GOOD-BYE, honest WHALLEY,
For years Punch be-chaffed!
There was worth 'neath the folly
At which folks so laughed. ,
Of mind you were single,
You never bore malice;
None of bitter could mingle
Less spice in life's chalice.
To your lights you were leal,
Though false lights prone to follow;
Your kindness was real,
Your hates, only, hollow.
Simla Similibus.
THE Maharajah of Alwar—a potentate
at Simla, who ought to be encountered
by the Maharajah of Nowar—has volun-
teered to equip and maintain, at his own
expense, a corps of camels and oamel-
dnvers for service on the frontier. Very
useful for the English forces. Bravo,
Maharajah of Alwar! May we meet with
many Simla characters.
DE JURE ET DE FACTO.
SUPPOSE the law, which makes all ratepayers, of a certain
standing, and with certain defined exceptions, liable to serve on
Juries, were brought to bear—not de jure, as at present—but de
facto? What would be like to come of it? Well-to-do Big-wigs,
who now escape the burden of Common Juries altogether, would not
like it. But—
Firstly. There would be some chance that the comfort and
accommodation of Common Juries, now cavalierly and completely
disregarded, would be attended to.
Secondly. Verdicts would be all the better for the leaven of better
trained brains, and wider experiences.
Thirdly. Council would address Juries under the wholesome
and much-needed check of increased respect for those they were
talking to.
Fourthly. A burden, borne for the public good, which, as now
imposed, lies heavy, would, when lightened, be next to nothing by
fair distribution.
Fifthly, the Big-wigs, in their turn, would learn a good deal from
a fair turn of duty in the common jury box.
Sixthly, and to conclude, the design of the British Constitution
—to get into a box twelve good men and true—would be helped for-
ward as it ought to be, by the upper, as well as the lower strata of
the middle class. In snort, without any Gambettising, even this
best of all possible Englands would be all the better for the in-
troduction of a nouvelle couche tociale into the jury box—all the
more, as we would take our new couche from above, instead of below,
the waist of the body politic.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

BRIGANDAGE AT HOME.
Tag-Rag and Bobtail Club, S. W.
i DEAR
MR. PUNCH,
Will you grant
me a little of your
space to enter my
strong protest
against the sys-
tem of brigand-
age which, in
spite of all that
has been done to
remedy it by
some courageous
• and much-to-be-
commended Man-
agers, still sur-
vives at most of
our theatres?
Last night I visit-
ed one of these
dens of thieves,
and what with
< fees here and fees
. •' there, I paid near-
) ly double for my
ticket. Theworst
of-it is, that the
way in'whioh'thisjblack mail is levied, makes it almost impossible to
avoid payment. At any rate, it is so with every man who, like
myself, would rather fork out his shilling than be scowled at. I am
afraid there are a good many just as weak-kneed in this respect as
I am. Again, why when I take my dear old mother to the theatre,
must the poor old lady be made to take off her venerable bonnet, and
sit in her still more venerable cap, in a place full of abominable
draughts called the Dress Circle, or the Balcony Stalls—a fee being
levied into the bargain for taking care of her said bonnet, while I
may sit beside her in a dressing-gown, if I choose? Then why
should a couple of strong-smelling programmes be thrust into my
hand, and a fee of a shilling charged for them? I wonder how many
customers would go back to a restaurant where, on paying your
first bill, you found yourself debited with sixpence for the bill of
fare? People talk of the decline of the Drama, and Managers wail
about empty houses, but I am only surprised that they are not
emptier, considering the system of robbery by saucy attendants
which they openly countenance. Wherever a better system is
worked, I am glad to see it worked by neat and attentive young
women. Box-keeping and Box-opening is eminently woman's
work. Wherever I have seen young women at it, they do it most
pleasantly and attentively.
I am, Mr. Punch, your obedient servant,
Oct. 19, 1878. JOHN STRONG.
"LIGHT, MORE LIGHT!"
REVERTING to a paragraph in our last number on the'urgent need
that JOHN BULL should bring all the light of his Bull's-eye to bear
on defaulting Directorates, we are glad to extract from the Times'
City Article (Oct. 18) timely warning of the efforts now being made
to keep that salutary and much-needed light away from the collapsed
City of Glasgow Bank:—
"The deputation of directors and shareholders of the City of Glasgow Bank
which came up to London yesterday, has had numerous interviews with bank
managers ana bill-brokers here to-day. The object of the deputation was
mainly to obtain the sanction of the London creditors to the voluntary wind-
ing-up of the affairs of the bank, and naturally this proposition was favour-
ably received. This method of winding-up is thought well of, because it is
said to lessen expenses, and it probably does so. But there is another cause
which makes creditors and debtors alike view it with favour, and that is the
facility which it affords for hiding things away. Not only are malpractices
apt to be concealed, but inconvenient facts about debts, liabilities, and the
position generally of customers and creditors of the bankrupt institution.
Now. this concealment is a thing which the mercantile community ought not
to tolerate for a moment in a case like the present. Wind-up the bank's
affairs by all means in the cheapest possible way, but let there be thorough
and complete publicity—nay, more, let there be condign punishment of those
whose malpractices, and fraudulent miestatcments or concealments of facts,
have wrecked the bank and caused the ruin of thousands of innocent people."
Saying this, the Times only says "Ditto to Mr. Punch," last
week. And Mr. Punch has great pleasure, in this very sad and
serious affair, in saying "Ditto to the Times," and in expressing
his hope that all attempts to huddle up the discreditable truth, and
keep the dirt dark, in the case of the collapsed Glasgow Bank, will
be utterly defeated.
CiECULAK NOTES.
(Jottings by Our Town Traveller.)
WHAT Mr. BIGNELL in vain attempted to prove before the
Magistrates was that the Argyll Rooms are guile-less. "What will
he do with it?" is the question; or, what is more important to the
Proprietor at least, What will he do without it? After a recent
decision, he won't be able to turn it into a "Progressive Club," on
the pattern of the " Lady Burrel," which was shut up by the
Magistrates' order ten days ago. Make it a theatre, and call it the
Big-Nell Gwynn. .
Sir JOHN LUDBOCK is on the Calendar as the City Saint,.," St.
Lubbock's Day" being dedicated to him as a genuine holyday. But
there was one who had a prior right to the title, and who should
certainly be the Patron Saint of "The House," and that is "St.
Simon Stock."
"Light, more light!" is "the Gaiety not the Goethe version" of
the Poet's last words—as Mr. H. J. BYRON describes his Little Dr.
Faust Burlesque,—applied, of course, to the Electric Illumination
outside.
As any stick will serve to beat a dog, so some people appear to
think that anv place in your nicely-furnished and polished-up room
is good enough tor striking a match on. Very annoying.
This isn't bad, from the Agony Column of the Times, Oct. llth :—
A well-born and accomplished ENGLISHWOMAN, living in society,
is desirous of corresponding with a Lady purposing to WINTER IN
MALTA, Gibraltar, India, or the Continent, and who would consider the
companionship of a young Lady as an equivalent for her travelling expenses.—
Address, &c.
This is a charming notion of "personally conducting" oneself.
Young, well-born, accomplished, and an ENGLISHWOMAN!
For she herself has said it,
And 'tis greatly to her ciedit
That she is an Englishwoman! Is there any other sort of woman who
would have put such an advertisement as this in the Times? Malta,
Gibraltar, India, or the Continent! There's a choice!

that innocent music and dancing licence '' merely for the recreation
of our children at Christmas time," as he expressed himself on the
occasion in question, in words to that effect. It was so hard on the

JUDGING BY APPEARANCES.
Undersized Youth. "Now THEN, FIRST RETURN, SUKBITON, AND LOOK
SHARP! HOW MUCH?"
Clerk. "THREE SHILLINGS. HALF-PRICE TINDER TWELVE!"
THE POWER OF SPEECH.
(As lately exemplified in the Midland Counties.)
SCENE—The interior of a Birmingham beershop after the break-
up of a political meeting. Two highly intelligent Opera-
tives discurered, rapt in thought orer a pot of four ale.
First Operative (rowing himself). Yes, it must be so! Our
most worthy CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER is unquestion-
ably right! Never was the outlook brighter. Our beloved
country has at last "taken its place in the great Council of
Nations."
Second Operating. As highly intelligent Operatives, let us
hail the change. To quote Sir STAFFORD'S own apt and beauti-
ful words, now that we are there^" We will not shrink back,
and let our Empire coll apse, as if it were an air-bladder which
had been pricked with a pin.
First Operative. No; for, as our admirable guide adds: "No-
bility implies obligations on those who are noble." And to
think that for the priceless privilege of nobility, purchased for us
by such noble sentiments, we pay but a paltry tourpenoe extra
on our tobacco I The thought unmans me! [He ts overcame.
Second Operative (handing him the pot). Nay, cheer up!
Our good Sir STAFFORD never meant to depress us with a sense
of onr blessings. Think of his lighter touches—Don Quixote's
pasteboard helmet, "Baron Munchauserfs tiger jumping down
the crocodile's throat, and—ha! ha! that capital storyabout
SHERIDAN and the letter! Why, it was all killing! What a
blessing that we, the intelligent Operatives of Birmingham, are
no longer in "leading strings," but able to understand and
relish epigram like this! Ha! I thought so;—you cheer up as
you recall it.
Pint Operative. I do. For by the light of such brilliant
flashes, the thought of the Berlin Convention, the Afghan
difficulty, the expanding expenditure—even fever in Cyprus—
become, not only tolerable, but delightful. Here's to "Im-
perialism!" [Finishes the ale.
Second Operative (looking thoughtfully at the empty pot). A
noble toast—worthy the oration that inspired it! And to think
that when I rose this morning I would. like you, in honour of
CHAMBERLAIN and the Caucus, cheerfully have thrown a couple
of brickbats at the head of our eloquent, our patriotic, our pro-
found, our excruciatingly funny, Sir STAFFORD!
First Operative. Yes. But that was before we had listened
to hi8 irresistible oratory.
Second Operative. True! Ah, may such long be the effect
of the right man on the right stump!
(Curtain falls.)
WHAT THE CITY OF GLASGOW BANK DIRECTORS HAD, AS WELL
AS THE SHAREHOLDERS.—Unlimited Lie-ability.
LES PARTIS HOSTILES TO LA REPUBLIQUE.
G-R-R-H! You presume to cock your nasty red cap in the air,
And with your horrid tricolor cockade your betters scare!
You dare to call yourself La France—foul scum of Eighty-Nine!
Socialists, Communists, Petroleuse—for all your phrases fine!
After your flaring, flaunting, catch-penny twelve-sou fair,
In the Champ de Mars!—such impudence! What business had it
there?
After doubling Paris prices with your mobs—as fools make fools—
Mon Dieu! That foreign Princes should have deigned to be your
tools!
After getting the poor Marshal, though, Heaven knows, against the
grain,
To hang the cross round those fools' necks, the badge who 'd stoop to
gain,
Not satisfied with blowing your Exposition brass,
You must fly higher, and attempt to give a Ball.—Alas !—
You give a ball'—a business that asks tact and politesse.
Usage du motide, and breeding, and the Art to move and dress :—
And at Versailles! the palace reared by Le Grand Monarque,
With his glorious memory springing with e&chjet d'cau in the Park!
No wonder 'twas a. fiasco—such a. fiasco !—Dieu de Dieu.'
Tag-ra? and bobtail thousands pent for hours in shivering queue,
Struggling, outside, through a mud sea, swelt'ring, inside, in a mob
Of canaille in all shades of red—knave, imbecile, and snob!
VOL. LTXV.
Non pas. Madame La Republique .' Such pride deserved a fall!
You might give an Exposition, out you couldn't give a Ball—
That is reserved for us, le Monde, which you, low hag, despise!
The next Ball you aspire to give, ask us to organise!
DE. CROSS'S DEGREE.
ON Thursday last the University of Cambridge, in compliance
with a vote of the Senate, '' conferred the honorary degree of Doctor
of Laws upon the Right Hon. RICHARD ASSH ETON CROSS, of Trinity
College, one of Her Majesty's principal Secretaries of State."
Doubtless the HOME SECRETARY has done something considerable to
earn the degree of Doctor of Laws. But both as a Legislator and an
Administrator, he is much more expressly distinguished by the
services he has rendered to Physic. The Medical Profession, and all
people interested in its scientific researches, owe Mr. CROSS the
Vivisection Bill; and Physiologists are still further indebted t)
liira for having put a stop to the practice of taking casts of the head<
of condemned criminals after their execution. It was all very well
to make him a Doctor of Laws, but, considering the special and
peculiar encouragement he has afforded to the Science of the
Healing Art, Mr. CROSS'S Alma Mater would have done better,
perhaps, if she had dubbed him Doctor of Medicine.
Naval Nomenclature.
SOME stupid person has been complaining of our christening some
late additions to the Navy by such names as Bouncer and Insolent.
Why should not ship's names, as well as ship's keels, be laid down
by the Jingo spirit-level?

SIX DAYS OF A SUBALTERN'S DIARY—CYPEUS.
MoifDA r.—Walked over Limestonia Hills in search of trees;
couldn't find any; so turned down Valley of Midgeria in hopes
of discovering vegetation; again disappointed; stumbled along bed
of river in search of water; search unsuccessful. Thorns and
thistles beastly; awfully pricked about legs. Returned camp.
Read newspaper article on "Beauties of Cyprus; its Flora and
Fauna."
Tuesday.—Down with fever. Thermometer in tent, 126°. After
making this meteorological observation, try to sleep. Can't. Query
which is worst—fever or flies? Make more observations.
Wednesday.—Fever subsiding. Glad to hear Government is
going to grant colonial allowance for Cyprus. Fever quite dis-
appeared. Invitation to quinine party. Accept.
Thursday.—Dust storm, lasting all morning. Helmet parried
away in a whirlwind; likewise paper with glowing article on
Cyprus. Don't seem to care about paper, but sorry for hat.
Write out claim on Government for damage done during storm and
sojourn in Cyprus. Claim appended.
Friday.—Attend quinine party. Ration beef very tough. Fruit
forbidden. After luncheon, play tit-tat-to; make ingenious fly-
traps, also calculation to ascertain day of month. Party breaks up.
Forward compensation claim to authorities. Fever and ague. Bed.
Saturday.—Heavy dew last night. Pole went through tent; tent
came down; let it stop till servant came in morning. Issue return
invitation for Monday. Send to Pay Office to find out if Government
allowance is granted. Reply: Government has sanctioned an

'ARRY AT THE PLAY.
o

I SENDS yer the
progrums I promised.
I 've bin on the gay,
And you'll find that
this dose is a dollup.
I'm gettin' dead nuts
on the play.
I 've bin going the
rounds rare and
rqrtV, along of a spif-
flical gal,
And as you 're still out
of the swim like, I '11
tip yer my notions-,
old pal.
The Music 'All once
was my mark, and I
thought the theayter
cold muffin,
Which SHAKKSI-EAR
and BYRON and them
on the 'ole is de-
cidedly duffin;
But now the Stage licks
arf the 'Alls, mate,
for side - splitters,
spice, and bare pink,
Oitisn'tarfdustvltell
ver; and so POLLY
JANE seems to think.
What I 'old is plays should be plays, and not hist'ry, or preachin,
or spout,
You go in for a laugh and a lush (don't P. J. lap the lemon and
stout!)
I 'm aware there is softs as prefers to see Virtue wop Vice at the
Vic.,
But we 've rose above all that old rot, and go in for what Frenchmen
calls " Chick.'"
"Chick's "—well, tain't so easy to say, but it's doosid like what ice
calls "cheek";
Sly saree, don't yer know, 'ot and sweet, with a dash of the blue, but
mixed weak.
The " blend" ain't a bad 'un, I '11 tell yer; the toffs put us up to the
fake,
And our taste and theirs in sech tilings is as like as two peas,—no
mistake!
In course they carnt go the 'ole 'og; my LOUD CHAMBEHLING 's down
if they does;
The bloomin' old Miwey must raise, now and then, jest a bit of a
buzz;
But, bless yer, there 's lots as he passes, 0. K. and accordin' to
Cocker,
As—well, soap-board crawlers might 'owl, but it suits me right up
to the knocker.
"Chick " does it, yer see; oh a neat bit of parley-van covers a lot,
And as most of our plays are now cribbed from the French, wy
they 're all pooty 'ot.
Legs? Bless you, my boy, they ain't in it with ogles and antics and
'ints,
As sets POLLY JANE on the snigger, and fetches the ochre in mints.
It's lummy to see the Swells lading at capers as tickles has too—
The Swells used to sit stiff as hice when the Gallery raised a bohoo;
Now one twigs out-an-outers a-boltin' wots too spicey 'most for
the Pit,
And if they don't clap like the " gods," wy, yer see, kids is given to
split.
Ain't they down on the treacly domestic P—a lay as I always did
'ate.
You know the old flapdoodle muck, tea for two and no stoppin' out
late;
Connoobial yum-yum for ever! no larks on the slvest Q. T.,
P'ramb'lators and properness—lord! it 'ud jest about collyfog ine!
We men o' the world, mate, knows better. Pink Dominos, hay ?—
that's ver style.
Lor', 'ow I did larf! and P. J. had a struggle to smooth out a smile.
Then The Idol that widder's warm-waterworks—quickly turned off
at the main—
And the no-neyer-mention-'em larks as they play in that sweet
Marjerlaine!
It's life, my dear boy, and no kid. 'Ow I wish you could see it, old
flick!
Carn't you run up to town for a week, and go in for a buster of
'(Chick" t
I know it's a lush as you 'd like, most as 'ot as they mix it in Parry,
I 'm off for a nip of it "now, so O river.' Yours rortily,

LOVE IN THE MIST.
A. Romantic Reverie. By Miss LACKADAY.
"Such stuff as dreama are made of."
I.
I AM sitting by the fire—I seem to be always sitting by the fire
now that the day's twilight and the twilight of my life are setting
in together, like the sobbing reflux of an eddying tide; my toes are
snugly perched upon the lender—the kettle is boiling over—it is
time to make tea. But I am too absorbed—too happy, somehow,
in unravelling strange sweet memories that meander on the Turkey
hearthrug on which my feet rest comfortably—too happy, too sor-
rowful—how shall I say which (are we not oftenest both at once—
happiest when it is so) ?—and I let the water bubble over till the
fire is out, while the children laugh and blow the sparks about the
room, and trample them out with their innocent feet. The room is
full of children—full of sparks. I think it is always so in the
twilight.
Children ! . . . Are we not all children? Do we not all blow about
the sparks of life, and laugh as we trample them out—then wonder
at the sting and the darkness that remain as we sit down in the cold
silent lamplight, and piece together the dim flickerings of our past-
listening, with wiser hearts, to echoes from the far-off shores?
"Echoes"! How many sermons there are in that word! I feel
that I could write them—that my life has written them. ... I think
it is better to write sermons than to read them.
But what was it that I was going to write about to-night? I
think I have forgotten... The children^ voices, busy with the present,
have drowned the memories of the old dead time. . . . How strange it
is this way in which the present revives the past, and makes us live
in it with a confused clearness!!!!
That little tea-table, with its rows of willow-patterned plates and
piles of hot-buttered muffins, recalls another tea-table to me—a kind
tea-table that was always spread in a bow-window looking out upon
the sea, with red roses clinging to its sashes, and a dazzle of hoar-
frost coming up from the daisied turf beyond. . . .
I cannot remember the name of the place, but it seems to me that
it was in the heart of one of our midland counties—somewhere in
Northamptonshire, I think—or it may have been Warwickshire. . . .
I remember a deep green valley, a lake, and endless avenues of
trees. ... 1 don't think I regret having forgotten the name of the
place—there is a charm about the Indefinite which names dispel.
The Indefinite—the Immaterial—the Infinite—and Unmeasurable—
Was not that the old-world idea of Heaven ?—is it not still the
dream of Science? A friend of mine, who is a great philosopher,
said to me the other day, "I mean to believe in Spiritualism: it
is a rest from clear ideas."
At one time of my life I was always having tea in that bow-
window—It is long ago—so long ago that, as I think of it, I seem
to be another person; and yet I can still hear the crack of the china
as it broke in my host's hands—Dear, kind old friend !—How clumsy
he was, and how we all loved him!—Nobody seemed to mind how
many cups he broke—except his wife, who must have been fond of
china, I think.—So am I now—but I did not care for it then, and I
had a sort of pleasure in seeing the Sevres cups smashed and the
cream running in rivers about the table-cloth, while the kind old
hands fumbled after napkins, and only made the damage worse. . . .
Broken china has had a poetry for me ever since.
Yes, she was fond of china, and of all pretty things—She was
herself the prettiest thing in the house, with those soft rich silks
that made a noiseless rustle as she walked—She had the kindest
smile and most beautiful manners.—There was a great peace about
her.—Nothing ruffled her for a moment.—She would smile just as
sweetly when the cups fell, and it did not make her angry if I used
to start at the crash—They say it was just the same when her son
died.... I think one thing was like another to her—joy and sorrow,
sunshine and rain—She translated it all into a music of her own.
She poured out tea with the grace of a countess of the ancien
regime—What a pity it is that women have not such manners now!
I think philanthropy and machinery are spoiling everything—Some-
body told me, long afterwards, that she was deaf. How beautiful
it is—this calm poetry of silence—to come and go smiling and mis-
understanding—never to know that hearts are breaking about you,
lives twisting. ... I think if I could live my life over again, I
would choose to be deaf. . . .
Then that other figure in the mourning robes, that came and went

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
like a dream,—who was she '( I never could quite make out. She
might have been a daughter-in-law—or a daughter, perhaps. They
called her ROSE or MYRTLE, or some such pretty name with a scent
of summer flowers in it. She was younger, sadder, more spiritual,
I think, than the other. A mystery hung about her—a recollection,
as it were, of sorrow and crime. Done, or suffered? That was the
question that fascinated me. . . .
I felt that she did not belong to our world, but to some dim
universe of old fables and fluttering tapestries, where heroes agonise
and wives stab their husbands in the dark. I loved her—she was
to me the incarnation of a dream—The faded crewels that she was
always working into the hems and linings of our gowns were the
threads of PENELOPE'S web; the scissors that hung at her chatelaine
were the shivering shears of Fate. She lives in my mind side by
side with the Wolf that ate Red Riding Hood.
II.
DID he belong to that strange world also? I have sometimes
thought he did. He had a sleepy look, and a way of calling her
"Sister," that somehow linked them together in my mind. But I
never knew what was the exact relationship between them. . . ,
He wore a brown velveteen coat, and looked in. I remember a
cup falling and a little start. R. played on—her cadences fell with
the broken china—the melody floated up among the roses—so did
the steam—it seemed one music, one love, one intensity. ... Is not
this life? . . . And she sat calm and sweet, with the smile that
somehow made one feel a vague security. . . . He asked me to put
sugar in his tea, and I forgot to do it. . . .
We neither of us spoke—it was enough to be together, and to feel
our youth and the immense beauty pulsating in sunset clouds around
us. There was a glory in every pool—little boys bathed far out
upon the sands—brown cattle came lowing across the common.—
I stooped down and picked a buttercup—its yellow calyx seemed to
mirror our happiness. ... A bell rang, and I saw my queen coming
towards us, with the evening glory on ner hair. . . .
"Is she not sweet and beautiful?" I said, holding the buttercup
over my head, and turning to note its beauty against the quiver of
the sultry summer noon. "Is she not sweet and beautiful?" I
said again, for he too was dreaming, and in his sleepy way he had
missed my words.
He yawned slowly, and patted the brown cows, saying, with a
gentle sing-song, "MTKTLE is very sweet and beautiful, and she is
my sister.—We are all beautiful here, and we think of nothing
else.—You will get used to it as you see more of us and come to
understand our ways. Will you come to luncheon?"
"Do come!" cooed my queen. And I followed her in, wondering
how long it would take me to get used to it. At any rate I was
sure that 1 liked it. ... At home it was all bustle and confusion,
children tumbling down-stairs, and a red-faced maid-of-all-work. . . ,
I already felt the poetry of having a butler and two footmen—I
thought it would be easier to be good here—it was like Sunday.
I tola him so—He smiled kindly, and said the butler would take
care of me. How well I remember those days of cakes and ale in
the pretty house where it was always summer!!! Do you not agree
with me, reader, that there are some places where it is always
summer, just as there are some people with whom it is always love?
I know it was so at X ;always summer and love and beauty;
and the tide coming up to make strange little adventures for us
among the creeks and landslips, and the sun setting with crimson
throbs, and shooting farewell floods upon the snow. . . .
How those voices used to come up to the window where I sat
dreaming and dallying! They walked up and down so late one
night that I grew nervous. At last she left him, and he stood there
alone.—I could not tear myself away—some vague instinct made me
forbode evil—I leaned out—Suddenly a sound broke the silence—
My heart stood still, but only for a second—in time I knew that
there was no danger. It was the bicycle with its wheels gliding
noiselessly across the terrace. . . .
How did he know that I was standing at MYHTLE'S window? . . .
I had no right to be there; it was only my feverish curiosity that
had brought me—only their voices that made it impossible for me to
go.—How did he know it? . . . The more I think of it, the more
puzzled I get—It was hardly five minutes since I had left her
brother in the paddock—I had made an excuse to get away from
him, and he had said good-bye—sadly—I felt it was cruel of me, but
to this day I cannot see how I could help it—Some vague instinct
told me the other was on the terrace. It was an opportunity not to
be missed.
He stopped under the window—the bicycle fell. I was afraid he
was hurt, out I did not scream, for fear of bringing MTBTLE. For a
wonder I kept cool; and when, a few minutes later, he whispered.
"All right!' I was able to answer, "Yes." Then he looked
'' Dearest!" I waved my hand—he was gone—But how did he know
that I should be there? . . .
Next day I had a scene with MYBTLE. . . . She had met him in the
morning, and I think he must have thoughtlessly told her about it,
for she seemed upset. She looked more than usually anxious, my
poor queen! She had the expression in her eyes, that made me
think of CLYTEMKESTHA—the expression that I liked so much! At
those times I never could refuse her anything. There was some
mesmerism in her face, that compelled me to be open. I told her
just what had passed. She made me promise to tell it to no one
else. As she was leaving the room, she turned round, and said,
with a pretty laugh, "There, be a good girl! Keep my secret, and
I will keep yours. You know if I were to tell Aim about it, he
would be angry." I had not thought of that myself—but I was
grateful to her for thinking of it. She was always considerate for
others. . . .
(To be concluded in our next.)

MASCULINE AND FEMININE FASHIONS.
LADIES and Gentlemen,—
The Chesterfield Coat
has been revived for
Ladies' wear. It is made
with or without a skirt of
the same material as its
own.
It has pockets in the
style of a gentleman's
coat.
The producers of the Ches-
terfield Coat have happily
adapted both the Coat and
the W aistcoat of the Louis
the Fourteenth style to
their Tweed Coats in two
methods. One of these is
the shape of a gentleman's
ordinary short jacket; the
other that of the regular
morning coat with side
body seams.
But, Gentlemen and La-
dies, these are not the only
novelties in the way of
attire provided for you at
a certain eminent Clothing
Establishment in a fashion-
able quarter of London.
There is also a Costume for the Moors.
The Paletot is long and close-fitting, with leather buttons. There
are Leggings to match. There is a hat, too, of the same cloth as the
Leggings and the Paletot. You can thus be equipped for the Moors,
if you wish to visit them, from head to foot. But though grouse-
shooting is over, which your Clothiers seem to have forgotten, no
doubt the Costume designed for the Moors would be equally suitable
to the Turnips or the Cover.
But even this, Gentlemen and Ladies, is not all that you are
offered by that extensive Clothing Firm.
Their new Hat for Costumes is the Jockey Cap. It is, they say, a
most stylish head-dress in cloth, and has the true jockey character-
istic; the addition of a ribbon run in round the edge finishing with
a bow in front to draw the cap tightly round the head. Of course
Gentlemen might have the cap made tor them so as to dispense with
this addition, which they might probably consider less becoming for
them than for Ladies.
"Now that Corduroys are so fashionable," the same Firm recom-
mend Ladies and Gentlemen to patronise their Corduroys, of which
they have a stock on view.
From the foregoing particulars, announced the other day in the
Morning Post, it would seem, Ladies—especially from the article
Corduroys—that the Rights of Women are progressing amongst the
Higher Orders.
Cause and Effect.
THE policy of BEACONSFIELD—apart from party glosing—
May most fitly be described in a single word—imposing!
On England he imposes the cry the Jingo mass adore,
As upon Affghanlstan he imposes an Ambassador.
But of either imposition JOHK BULL may look for close sure,
That which all impositions is wont to dog—exposure.

ALARMING FIT OF THE VAPOURS.—Among Gas Shareholders.
"LORD SEND US A GUDE CONCEIT 0' OURSELS."
AMONG all the unexpected powers revealed by Sir STAFFORD
NORTHCOTE'S recent stumping tour in the Midlands, the power of
getting comfort from strange sources is perhaps the most striking.
After the revelation of utter unpreparedness in every step taken,
or rather, not taken, by the War Office in connection with the late
occupation of Cyprus, who would have expected to read this in our
buoyant CHAJTCELLOB of the EXCHEQUER'S Dudley oration :—
"No doubt while the lessons of the Crimean War were at once melancholy
and salutary .... nothing could be more cruel or more unjustifiable than to
expose gallant men to losa of life, and to great privations nnd sufferings for
want of preparations and supplies. (Cheers.) And if now it should be our ill
fortune at any time to be compelled to call upon that army to vindicate tho
honour of the country, we feel that we may do BO without any feeling ot
remorse and self-reproach which must have been felt by the Ministers of the
time when they were sending men to hard service and the risk of life without
preparation."
This is pretty cool in the face of the sufferings of the fever-stricken
garrison of Cyprus, alternately shivering or sweltering in bell-tents,
without anything to show that the least foresight has been exercised
by the War Office for the preservation of their health, or the
smallest provision made for their comfort or convenience.
Cooking and Dishing.
THE French do not altogether excel us in Cookery. 'British
Directors of Joint-Stock Companies beat the best of Frenchmen in
cooking accounts. Yet one often hears of a Bank Parlour, but
never of a Bank Kitchen. Every Bank has its Parlour, of course.
Let us hope and trust that Banks containing Kitchens in which any
other things than articles of food are cooked are rare and rascally
exceptions to the general rule.

ON THE WRONG HORSE.
Hints to a distinguished Captain and Gentleman-Rider entered for
a Military Steeple-Chase.}
TNSTANTLY get on your
I high horse whenever a
-*- chance offers.
Butter the Government-
no matter how
thick. The more
you lay on, the
more is likely to
stick.
Talk offhand
about "Im-
perial policy,"
National po-
licy," and " In-
sular policy,"
but don't put
your foot in it
by attempting
to define them.
If hard-up for
matter, try a bit
of clap - trap;
and if that don't
answer, take to
slanging. Here
you will pro-
bably find your-
self at your ease. Remember the story of the Greek fellow, with
a long name, who set fire to the Temple of Ephesils. If you want
to score, fly at high game.
Carry this out by presenting the most illustrious opponent you can
select in some ludicrous and contemptible character—say, as a
"washerwoman." Follow this up with an attack on his nloral
oharacter. and fling the mud about freely till you have raised an
uproar. Do all this, and a good deal more in the same style, when-
ever you open your mouth—that is, of course, if your object be not
to get into Parliament. Should you, however, change your mind,
and wish to get in, take counsel of Mr. Punch. He likes to watch

to you is—try another mount.

OUR 1USPHBSENTATIVE MAN.
How I found Stanley—St. James's Hall—All in the Dark—Some
Moore—Travellers' Next Step—On to the Globe—Les Cloches
de Cornenlle.
I WENT to hear Mr. H. STANLEY give an account of himself, and
what he did in the Dark Continent—not the Keep-it-Dark Continent
—on Wednesday last.
His reading,—that is, as much as I could hear of it in three
quarters of an hour, and I don't know for how long it lasted, but I
suppose he has finished by this time,—forcibly recalled to my mind
an anecdote about W. M. THACKERAY. After the great novelist had
given his first lecture on The Four Georges, he asked a friend,
experienced in entertainments, what he thought of it, and if he had
any advice to give him. The friend, who was not gifted with the
bump of reverence, and who certainly preferred ALBERT SMITH'S
Mont Blanc to anything merely instructive, replied: "Well,
THACK, my boy, it's very good! Oh, yes, it's very good! But,
look here, if you want to make it go, ynu must have a pianner.'"
And this is exactly what I say to Mr. STANLEY. "Highly in-
teresting, no doubt, only you ought to have a.pianner,—and picturs:
and, what's more, you should leave out all the sentimental, serious,
religious twaddle which was years ago associated with STIOGINS
tea-fights and Exeter-Hallites, and give us something that we
haven t read in your two illustrated volumes."
The answer now to "How I found STANLEY?" is, of course, "By
taking tickets for St. James's Hall." How I liked STANLEY when
I 'd found him, is quite another question, to which I can only
answer, '' Pretty well, thank you." And I dare say he '11 improve on
acquaintance (for I see he is going on lecturing), if he '11 take the
advice above given of a sincere well-wisher, who repeats emphati-
cally, "Let's have pianner and picturs; let there be no Methody in
your madness, but send all that cant to the Princess's, where they '11
put it into Uncle Tom's Cabin, and sing "Hallelujar! Jordan s a
wide river, boys!"
Those who went to see STANLEY must have been considerably dis-
appointed, as they could only catch a glimpse of a third of him,
sectionally,—the remainder, from the tirst button of his shirt-fronl
to his toes, being hidden by a table and a reading-desk, which looked
for all the world as if it had once formed part «f an old-fashioned
sulpit. Of course all who were in punctually, saw the entire
STANLEY from head to heel, but unless they stopped to the end,
;hey never saw so much of him again as they got in that one brief
fiance when he first walked on to the platform.
The arrangement of the platform and the back-ground is highly
exciting to the imaginative mind, and those accustomed to such
entertainments as are nowadays given in Music-Halls and at the
Aquarium, were expecting great things. The chairs, placed in three
semi-circular rows behind the Lecturer, were eminently suggestive
of an increased band of Nigger Minstrels to join in, at some portion
of the reading, with melodies of their own native land; while a
scaffolding above, reaching right up to the'dome, high in the air,
struck the initiated in such matters as being put there for Mr.
STANLEY to take a header off, into a net below, which would be pre-
sently brought forward by the servants on the establishment, while
the nigger in evening dress, who was at first supposed to be a Christy
Minstrel escaped from a lower room in the Hall, would throw the
Lecturer a trapeze, when the organ would strike up, " We Fly by
Night," and the Daring Traveller, who had gone through the Black
Continent and come out safely the other side, would fly through the
air, and, amid the deafening cheers of his admirers, would land on
the front railing of the opposite gallery. The Daring Traveller,
however, did nothing of the sort, and those who had expected as
much as this, must have been wofully disappointed.
He might have done it after I had left. I am not prepared with
evidence on this subject; but all I can say is, as he himself says of
his French traveller who tells tales out of school rather at variance
with Mr. STANLEY'S, "If anyone saw him do it, then he taw what I
dii! not." (Cheers after this. Why cheers? It was evidently a
point. But why P)
Another practical joke—for the above-mentioned arrangement of
chairs and scaffolding up to roof partook of the nature of a practical
joke, or intentional sell.—another practical joke was the Pantomime
Map suspended behind the Daring Traveller. Poor ARTEMUS WARD!
What fun he would have got out of thia Map. There were Sahara
and Madagascar on it very large, reminding one of the adventures
of the three sailors who took a Doat and went to sea, and perhaps it
was originally intended to say something about—
"I 've gone wrong for the Bake of Sahara."
But the idea was given up at the last moment on account of there
being no pianner. As the Lecturer had told us how he gave Daily-
Telegraphic and New-York-Heraldic names to the lakes and moun-
tains—e.g., Gordon Bennett to a very tall mountain, Lake Lawson to
the largest double sheet of water with the largest circulation in the
world—I at first thought that SAHARA was a misprint for SALA,
and that, presently, the Intrepid Traveller would point out one spot
where he had erected a finger-post, for the information of future
travellers with "Here Stands a Post" written on it, which central
district he had called the Clement Scottland. But no. On ne
badine pas avec STANLEY.
There was a twinkle of great humour, though, in the eye of the
Coloured Gentleman (when the Coloured Gentleman was awake,
which did not appear to be very often) as he sat huddled up help-
lessly on the platform. When he opened his bright eye, he looked
first at the Lecturer, as though to say, "Hallo, Massa GINOEB,
still at it P" and then at the Audience, as much as to add, "He's
got you now, and, golly! hs won't let you go—I know him ;" and
then he gave a silent chuckle, and dozed off again, meditating per-
haps on whether he had really " bettered " himself by leaving that
jolly old humbug, 'MTESA, the Star of Africa," and taking
service with the Lecturer. What are the odds against the " Star of
Africa" appearing within the next year at the Aquarium f
His master informed the audience that Massa SAMBO didn't under-
stand English; but I fancy I saw SAMBO grinning to himself, as
if saying, quietly. "That's all you know about it, Massa STAMLEE.''
On the whole, I think this nigger had the best of it, and enjoyed the
whole thing as a big practical joke from beginning to end.
Personally I am grateful to Mr. STANLEY for having selected 8t.
James's Hall for his lecture; as when I did not care about hearing
more up-stairs, I went to hear MOORE below.
The Dark Continent, as represented by the Christys, is good
enough for me. I can read Mr. STANLEY'S book in my own room,
and enjoy it, but it's hard work to be sermonised at from a pulpit
about 'Mtesa, Uguse, and Uganda, in whom, as at present consti-
tuted, I have no interest, except when they are exhibited in the
Moore and Burgess state of civilisation, with white frills, large
watch-chains, diamond studs, ruffles, and wearing decorations gfven
to them by various potentates.
What a chance Mr. STANLEY has lost in not dressing like JKobinton
Crusoe and bringing on the real Friday! A few good songs, some
first-rate dances between Robinson (STANLEY) and Friday (the
nigger), and all London would have rushed to him, specially at
Christmas time. Let him take the hint. "It's never too late to
mend," as Mr. CHARLES READE says. Friday on the bone*.

I hadn't seen the MOOEE AND BUBGESS Minstrels for years. The
place was crammed, and the peculiar singing peculiarly good. Mr.
MOOEE was very funny. But what delights me is the serious interest
taken hy the gentlemanly nigger, in the centre, in the adventures of
Messrs. Tambourine and Bones, the corner men, as related by them-
selves. It is delightful! The Bones (Mr. MOOBE) has not the
slightest respect for any sentiment, or for any singer. "Whenever it
occurs to him that a note is too long, or that a song is beginning to
be a trifle monotonous, he at once relieves the dulness with some
utter absurdity done in the quietest possible manner.
The first part of the entertainment, the genuine Christy Glee part,
is the best; and this is really unique of its kind, and well worth a
visit. But oh! what execrably bad taste on the part of Tour Repre-
sentative, Sir, to prefer the London Blacks to the genuine Central
African produce, quietly resting on STANLEY'S platform. Well, I
can't help it. Exclaim, if you will, " O tempora.' O Mores !" and
I will reply, " O tempora! O Burgess and Moore's!"
And now, to finish up geographically, let us study the Globe and
what is going on there.
It speaks well for the future of Light Operatic Entertainment that
such excellent houses should still be the rule at the Globe, where
the Cloches de Corneville is given, and at the Opera Comique, where
H.M.S. Pinafore is still at the height of its thoroughly well-
deserved popularity.
Let Cloches is put on the stage far and away better than it was in
Paris, and the acting of the Chorus-girls, all pretty and attractive,
is superior to that of their Parisian originals at the Fol icm! >ram at iques.
Mr. PATTLTON as the Baillie is capital. The business of the letter-
reading, in Act II., is the funniest thing I 've seen for a long while;
and in this portion of the dialogue the Authors, Messrs. F.ut N i K AND
RKKCK, are at their best.
Mr. SHIEL BABBY was excellently made up, except in hands, which
did not correspond with his sickly face and decrepit state; his
acting is very good in the First Act; but, in the Second, where the
original Gaspard, MlLHEB, was strongest, Mr. SHXEL BAEBT is disap-
pointing. This may be partly owing to the stage arrangement,
which cramps his action. But for all that, I still think that, out ot
Opera, he could fairly represent ROBSON'S great part of Daddy
llardacre.
Miss COBA STUABT is an acquisition, but must beware of monotony
of action. She has been, it seems, trained in the One Action School.
The performance altogether thoroughly deserves the support it has
obtained and is obtaining, and what it lacks in brilliancy of tone in
the vocal part, is made up by the brilliancy of the mise-en-scene,
costumes, and the pretty bright faces. We have not yet got the
executants, untonir the men at least, for French Comic Opera of this
lighter sort, but in Pinafore the right men are in the right place;
at least so ventures to say YOUE REPRESENTATIVE.
A VERY NATURAL INFERENCE.
IT is impossible not to feel the force of the Commander-in-Chief s
Sithetic deprecation in his speech on Army Administration at the
aberdashers' Company:—
"I a«sure you, Gentlemen, that in these matters there are a variety of con-
,-iilci iitions on both sides, and these considerations are not lost sight of by
those who are intrusted with the administration of the Army. We may not
be quite as wise as other people, but I submit to you that it may be a mistake
to put down all officials as fools."
Not all officials, your Royal Highness—only all Army officials.
Remembering Crimean and Cyprus blundering, and the usual fate
of military undertakings, in their first stages at least, till those
responsible for them have had the benefit lot' that experience which
as the old saw says "makes fools wise," is the popular inference to
be wondered at?

JUST IN TIME.
MK. WVBROW ROBERTSON, having roused British passion in earnest
by his unwary announcement of selected Tableaux from the Ober-
Ammergau Passion-Play at the Aquarium, has had the good sense to
acknowledge his mistake, and back out of his blunder.
NoLa day too soon,* For on the heels of his letter announcing his
withdrawal of these Tttdeaux comes a pithy telegram to the Times,
which turned into literal English, runs :—
"Representation of the Ober-Ammergau Passion-Play at the Aquarium
Theatre—humbug. No native of Ober-Ammergau has anything to do with it.
Legal steps in progress. Please make public. L.ANO, Burgermaster's Office."
So it seems that Mr. WYBB.OW ROBERTSON has not only roused
the British Lion, but has done so under, let us say, a mistake. His
Passion-players would have been impostors—violating propriety and
outraging respect for sacred things in borrowed plumes. Of course
Mr. WYBROW ROBERTSON did not know this. But how very unfor-
tunate he has'Vjesn ii the whole business.

Snce of the monks of Ettal, hard-by, and,
if a vow.
Ion of the play stayed the pestilence in 1633
(as these simple Ober-Ammergauers believe), its continuance may in-
troduce a new^pestilence in 1880, should it bring on Ober-Ammergau,
as yet pure and simple, the plague of speculating Managers to tempt
the village Actors, as well as of COOK'S tourists and cosmopolitan
audiences, to poison the village life with greed of gain, and take
the sanctity of simple faith from this Passion-Play, so turning it
—as there is already fear it has begun to be turned—into a show
which, in becoming popular, must become profane.
CAMBRIDGE COLOURS.
FROM the subjoined announcement there appears to be a good time
coming for our Cambridge Crews:—
"THB RIVER CAM.—At the Cambridge Improvement Board yesterday it
was resolved that immediate steps be taken for diverting the sewage of the
town from the river Cam. and mat Sir JOSEPH BAZALGETTK be requested to
advise the Board as to the best mode of doing so."
The Cam's colour will probably also be the better for purification,
so as to be no longer in such flagrant contradiction to the tint
wherewith it is associated in boating circles—" light blue."
Jockeys and Judges.
IT is announced that Sir HENRY HAWKINS has been elected an
honorary member of the Jockey Club, as also was his learned Brother,
Sir SAMUEL MARTIN, three years ago. The Jockey Club has done
wisely in calling to its counsels two good Judges, in the ordinary
sense, as well as the special one in which a man. is spoken of as a
"good judge " in the horsey world—that is, a good judge of a horse.
Unfortunately, as assessors at the Jockey Club s assize-courts,
Brothers HAWKINS and MARTIN have no power to commit rogues
and swindlers convicted of tricks, whether of ownership or jockey-
ship.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WHAT IT MAY COME TO.
(Bif Mr. Punch'i Prophetic Telegraph.)
ALEXANDRIA, Saturday.
MEETING of
the Egyptian
Cabinet was
held on
Thursday,
with the
KHEDIVE in
the chair, at
which Mr.
RIVERS WIL-
SON and the
Mi nister -
Representa-
tives of the
'• interested
Powers"
were present.
The occasion
was more
than usually
exciting, as
this was the
first time that
the members
'' chosen with
a view to
soothing in-
ternational
susceptibili-
ties "had had
an oppor-
tunity of
meeting for
mutual con-
sultation.
The Minister of Finance (Mr. RIVERS WILSON) opened the pro-
ceedings by explaining that the time had arrived for the payment
of the Autumn Coupons, secured on the revenue of the Egyptian
Railways. He was happy to say that the money in hand was amply
sufficient to meet all demands in full.
The Minister of Public Works (France) protested. The Railways
belonged to his department, and he would not allow his English
colleague to interfere with them. Great Britain was a grasping
power. In France the aims of perfidious Albion were thoroughly
understood, and appreciated—he would not say, seen through.
The Minister for War (Russia) agreed with his French colleague.
The funds of the Egyptian Railway Department could not be better
spent than on military preparations of a secret character. At any
rate, in this matter his (the Minister for War's) hands had not been
tied by the Treaty of Berlin.
Mr. RIVERS WILSON urged that the money belonged to the
creditors of the State. It would go to pay the bondholders of
England and France. Surely he could rely upon the support of his
French colleague?
The Minister of Public Works begged to repeat that in France
England had always been known in the best informed political
circles as " perfidious Albion." He had nothing more to say.
The Minister of Marine (Italy) said that the money might be far
more usefully spent upon the Wavy. He had privately informed his
Highness the KHEDIVE that, unless an alliance offensive and defen-
sive were immediately concluded between Egypt and Italy, he (the
Minister of Marine) should consider it his duty to retire from the
Cabinet. The interests of Italy and Egypt were identical on the
shores of the Mediterranean.
The Minister of Agriculture (Austria) protested in the warmest
manner. His Italian colleague was evidently aiming at Trieste.
The Egyptians were not the only semi-independent subjects of the
SULTAN in the world. He (the Minister of Agriculture) claimed that
the money should be handed over to him to be expended in much-
needed improvements in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Minister of Public Instruction (Germany) could not consent
to this. He demanded that the money should be used in suppress-
ing Socialism everywhere. The Egyptian Finances would never br
in a satisfactory condition until the smouldering fires of Social
Democracy had been stamped out in every quarter of the universe.
The Minister for War (Russia), speaking also on behalf of his
colleagues, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs (Bulgaria) and the
Interior (Greece), who had both of them requested him to represent
them, ag^ain urged that the money should be used for military
preparations of a secret character.
Mr. RIVERS WILSON implored his colleagues to consider only the
interests of Egypt and the Egyptian bondholders.
The other Ministers, in chorus, explained that they were greatly
grieved and surprised at this observation. They added that it must
be obvious to everyone that the prosperity of Egypt and the security
of the Egyptian Bondholders were the two objects nearest to their
hearts.
The KHEDIVE expressed himself thoroughly satisfied with this
explanation, and requested the Cabinet to come to some decision.
Alter a pause His Highness was informed that the Cabinet could
not comply with his request.
The KHEDIVE then said it was his pleasant duty to dissolve the
Meeting. He was more than contented with his present advisers,
and begged to offer them his sincerest acknowledgments. He quite
agreed with them that there was preat difficulty in disposing ot the
funds paid into the Treasury from the Egyptian Railways in a
manner that would not wound international susceptibilities. He
thoroughly appreciated those susceptibilities. Under these circum-
stances he considered it advisable to keep the money in dispute in
his own pocket—till his Cabinet could come to an agreement".
The proceedings then terminated.
CANNIBALISM ?'. VIVISECTION.
THE late Mr. SAMUEL ROGERS, poet and banker, once, called
monkeys "our poor relations." Mr. DARWIN, in scientific earnest,
has contended for—if not exactly proved—their consanguinity with
ourselves. A Bishop, and a Bishop's son, have not only echoed
ROGERS, but even endorsed DARWIN. Fact. At an Anti-Vivisec-
tion Meeting, held at Southampton the other day, the Bishop of
WINCHESTER presided, in the absence of Lord SHAFTESBURY. He
said, in holding forth, there were certain parties he would call his
friends, and—
'First the brute creatures, many of whom were among the warmest friends
of mankind—their dumb, and, as people called them sometimes, their 'poor
relations,' although he did not eee that, with freedom given them, they were
poorer than mankind—indeed they were oftentimes far richer."
Referring to these words, the Rev. Canon WILBEHFORCE, in a
subsequent speech, observed that:—
"He was not going to enter to-night into the question of whether animals
were possessed of immortality—not but it would oe a far harder task to dis-
prove than to prove this (' Hear.' hem-!'), but when they looked at the
wonderful development of what he could only call intellect in some of those
creatures, and saw in them sometimes what looked marvellously like an
exhibition of the Christian virtues, he thought they were justified In calling
them, as the Bishop did just now, their relations, and not always their poor
relations. (' Hear! hear .'')"
A most excellent argument against Vivisection, undoubtedly.
But clearly an argument equally good against Butchers. If animals
are really and truly our relations, poor or rich, what is killing them
but murder, and eating them but cannibalism? The Rev. Canon
WILBERFORCE (the son of SAMUEL) should be a Vegetarian, as well
as a Teetotaller.
Among the other speakers was Miss COBBE, who read an address,
in which, though womanly feeling was of course combined with
masculine vigour, the former perhaps a little preponderated. Miss
COBBE observed that—
"For her part, though she had no sympathy with sporting, she indig-
nantly repudiated comparing the sportsmen of tne field to the sportsmen of
the laboratory, and asked did our sportsmen tie down a fox to a table, and
slowly dissect its quivering nerves for two hours at a time, as PAUL BERT
tormented a dog, or bake rabbits, as CLAUI>E BBUNAHD baked one in his
stove.''
Certainly the sportsmen of the field are not to be compared with
the sportsmen of the laboratory. In the first place, there are no
sportsmen of the laboratory, such as Miss COBBE means. Vivisectors
pursue not Sport, but Science. Then the pursuit of Science, even by
vivisection-differs materially, both as to end and means, from fox-
hunting. Vivisection is practised for the acquisition of medical and
surgical knowledge; fox-hunting as a mere amusement. Which
would Miss COBBE prefer, if she were forced to choose—to be vivi-
sected, and forthwith killed, under chloroform, or to be chivied over
the country miles and miles as hard as ever she could go, till she
could go no further, and then to be torn alive in pieces by dogs?
And all for fun! And that too when a red-herring trailed in and
out and round about the requisite distance would serve just the same
purpose as that particular poor relation, the fox!
We may expect that the Hampshire Independent will shortly
announce that the Bishop of WINCHESTER, the Rev. Canon WILDER-
FORCE, and Miss COBBE have all sworn no longer to devour their
relations, the ox, the sheep, and the pig.

REVEREND SlU,
I AM a thief. There is no doubt about it. I have
been examined before the Magistrates, and all the awk-
ward particulars have come out. I have read in the papers
that you give testimonials of " high character" to gentle-
men in my position. Do please, Sir, give one to me.
There is not a redeeming feature in my case. I admit it.
But that cannot be helped now, and I hope it won't make
any difference to you. Do you know of any other Clergy-
man who gives testimonials of this kind? Because I
think that, if I could only get a few more. I might come
off easy at the Assizes on the ground of character. I
am told that your last testimonial made a great impres-
sion on the Court. Please address, in the first instance,
C. BATHS, Esq., care of the Governor, York Castle.
N.B.—I need not tell you that I am not a dirty pick-
pocket or anything of that kind. I embezzled £10,000.

THE LAST NEW DEFINITION OF HOME-RULE.—Obstruc-
tion.
A MODEL LEADER.
THE country will hoar with satisfaction that the Government,
after mature consideration of the aspect of affairs in Afghanistan,
has decided upon doing something. What that something is precisely,
has not yet officially transpired. Whether it is the resolve of the
Government to invade Afghanistan at once, or to postpone action
against the recalcitrant Ameer tine die, we are not yet in a position
to say. Earl GAT, in a long and able letter, which we publish else-
where, leaves little to be said against the first proposal; Sir 1!AKTKLI
FAIR and Sir STEPHEN JAMES, whose communications we also print
in another column, leave as little to be said against the second one.
There is much to be said on both sides; and we must admit that our
correspondents have not spared our space in saying it. The country
must read these various communications—if it can spare the time—
and decide for itself upon the rival policies.
Lord GAT'S arguments would be more conclusive if they did not end
with an inconclusive conclusion. On the other hand, Sir STEPHEN
JAMES'S statement would settle the question completely, did not
some question occur as to the completeness of the settlement. There
is no doubt that our dealings with the Ameer for some time past
have been all wrong, but we do not see what that has to do with it
from a practical point of view. The argument from abstract right
is only of antiquarian interest. The question is not moral, but
military. We have said so before. We may probably have occasion
to say so again. The statement is concise and alliterative, if not
exactly conclusive or enlightening. The country is in no mood to
argue nice points of morality, especially in regard to its dealings
with a half-barbarous country. - The earthly Providence of a vast
Asiatic dependency cannot afford to be more ethically punctilious
than other Providences—the Providence usually invoked by armed
despotism, for example, or that which is authoritatively asserted to
be ever on the side of the biggest battalions. We are 01 more value
than many Afghanistans, and have, consequently, the right to make
self-preservation pur first—and last—law. Whether it is expedient
to exercise that right, is another question; but it is a question for
us only. This is a nice mild, musty way of putting it, which must
commend itself to the common sense of the country. The country is
in no mood for selfish dogmatism or arrogant bluster.
Earl GAT says that a Russian invasion of India is a big Bogey. We
need hardly say that we entirely agree with him. It is what we have
systematically urged all along. The idea may be dismissed as a wild
Chimera. But to the more thoughtful alarmists the banished Bogey
and the dismissed Chimera have somehow come back in another
guise—really an unpleasant one. It is just on the cards, they say,
that Russia may unwarrantably take upon herself to imitate our own
conduct in India by setting up on its own account as the earthly Pro-
vidence of a vast Asiatic dependency adjoining our own; and that
would be awkward. Two earthly Providences in Central Asia might
not agree in their dispensations, especially at close quarters. Of
course this would take time. Earl GAT says it is often as foolish to
look too far forward, as to watch only the things immediately before our
eyes. This is quite true. It is equally foolish to look too far backward.
It, for example, we were to look over our own leaders fer the last twelve
months; but no matter. Sufficient for the day are the statesman-
ship and the journalism thereof. We should entirely agree with our
noble correspondent, but for the fact that on many points we entirely
differ from him. He overlooks the grievances we have against the
Ameer. That the Ameer has also grievances against us is true,
indeed, but scarcely to the purpose. Our conduct nas been entirely
indefensible j but then what we have to defend is not our conduct,
but our dominions; and if we cannot conveniently do that without
attacking him, so much the worse for him.
We must again insist that it is not a moral question. It is a
question for Soldiers, if only they would agree upon the answer!
But who shall decide when BURNABT, ADTE, ana HAVELOCK dis-
agree? Of course, if the Ameer cannot hurt us, we need not hurt Mm.
We can in that case afford to be just, magnanimous, or, at worst,
indifferent. The difficulty is to find out whether or no he can hurt
us. The country must make up its mind on that point, which, with
the aid of our luminous leaders, it will doubtless have little difficulty
in doing. And then we shall agree with the country. We wish the
country would make haste about it, for this prolonged uncertainty
is trying to trimming journalists. Our eminent correspondents
rather add to the difficulty, for they differ diametrically in theii
views; and to agree with them all round, as we earnestly endea-
vour to do, though agreeable to the feelings, is distracting to the
intellect.
Earl GAT and Lord FLORENCE think we had better stop as we are.
The country would be very happy to think that they are right. So
should we. Indeed, we do think so—almost. A contest could bring
us little good, and might bring us much harm. And if this reasoning
is sound, then the preparations of the Viceroy for war are a flagrant
iniquity. But then we have gone too far to draw back, and must
do—what we have the pleasure of informing our readers the Govern-
ment is about to do—Something! The country, however, is in no
mood for embarking in n vague and boundless adventure of annexa-
tion. To-morrow we shall doubtless have more correspondence
from eminent hands to deal with, and then—we shall see.

PIG-STICKERS, BEWARE!

OH, a capital sport is Pig-sticking, no doubt,
If your seat is assured and your muscles are stout;
With a tough-shafted spear, keen of point, and held
straight,'
And the pluck for a charge plus the nerve for a wait,
You may find in the Boar the best sport of the jungle:
But still 'tis a sport where to falter or bungle
Is like to prove fatal. "Pig-stickers, beware!"—
A discouraging notice to post in his lair!
When the jungle is beaten, the boar-spear in hand,
And the hog, bristles up and, tusks bared, makes his
stand,
To slip in one's seat, give a dubious glance
(Like a carver unskilled) at the point of one's lance,
Is not Pig-sticking form by a very long shot.
Forewarned is forearmed; but blow cold and blow hot
Is a (fame that will bring one to grief in the chace,
And if in the jungle the Sportsman should trace
Bigger tracks than the Boar's, hesitation may prove
From circumspect caution the farthest remove.
If the sport you misdoubt, if the game you can't face,
The best thing, of course, is to give up the chace.
But if you mean business, its risks you must dare,
Nor be funked by the notice, "Pig-stickers, beware!"

ECHOES OF THE BACKSTAIRS.

HEBE is a capital anecdote about the VICKHOY which has a special
value at the present moment. As BEACONSFIELD was having his
hair arranged one day last week, and was chatting, as is his wont,
familiarly with his dresser, on the growing complication in Asia, the
possibility of seizing Afghanistan T)y a coup de main at the Khyber
came in its turn on to the held of discussion. "Then you think, my
Lord," said the perruquier, taking his cue from the tone of the pre-
ceding conversation, "that the VICEEOY is up to a trick or two with
the cards?"
"Yes," was the prompt reply, "but he can't manage 'the
Pats.'"
I think this is quite one of the best things BEACONSFIELD ever
said.

It seems that when HAWEIS was trying the tone of the new carillon
at St. Paul's the other day, the Canons, nervous lest he should crack
or chip any of the bells, came up in a body into the belfry to see what
he was at. They found him, as might have been expected, laying
about him freely with a powerful sledge-hammer and taking notes.
Seeing that their presence in no way disturbed him, LIDDON,
who is never at a loss on an occasion of the kind, stepped forward in
his bluff genial way, and said, "Well, Mr. HAWEIS, if you were to
strike us like that, I fancy we should sing out in a different
fashion!'
"I'll be bound yon would," retorted HAWEIS, quickly, making
the tower reel again, as, with a thundering blow, he extracted a
diminished fifth from the Major Tenor; "but Canons are generally
made up of gun metal; and the sooner you all go off the better!"
There was a short, awkward pause, till the shaft slowly went
home. In a few minutes the Canons withdrew, and HAWEIS
completed his work for his interesting letter to the Times.
I heard a good thing of SALISBURY'S about the "Decoration"
scare. It appears that when BESSEMER went down to the Foreign
Office on the subject, words, as usual, ran high, and things seemed
likely to come to an unpleasant pitch, when the great Inventor
abruptly remarked, "Well, orders are not unassociated with
SALISBURY, though the order of the day seems to be not' Salisbury
Coloured,' but' Salisbury plain.'"
"Yes," replied the facile Foreign Secretary, nothing taken aback
bv the involved ingenuity of the satire, "and, talking of Salisbury
plain, the spire is not ' decorated.'"
When this was translated to MACMAHON, he laughed heartily.
Sir GEOBGE BOWYER, who is too keen a humorist to let the music
question pass without turning it to account, observed the other day
to ARTHUR SULLIVAN. "What! a hundred thousand a year for
singing! Why, they 11 teach the children next with five-pound
notes."'
LESLIE, in repeating this, added: "Mark my words. If that
gets to the PREMIER'S ears, Sir GEORGE will have Jus Committee."

THEY gave me a Garter in June,
And now they declare they were wrong;
But though Britain alter her tune,

I will turn for it now to Pig-tail.

Polite Em-

his list). Oh, yes,
of course, the
lovely Mrs. PEA-
COCK! I trust,
Madam, that you
have brought a

Mr*. Peacock. My Man has, 1 believe, the larger part of my
wardrobe in boxes in the hall.
•Polite Employe. A thousand thanks, Madam! Mr. KAMMEREE
will have the honour to attend upon you immediately.
Aristocratic Bride (in white satin and orange blossoms). I trust
that Mr. KAMMERF.U will see me as soon as possible. I nave been
waiting here for some time.
Polite Employe. Certainly, my Lady, certainly. But you see
there will be a greater demand for Mrs. PEACOCK'S carte than for
yours for the moment. Mr. KAMMERER thinks it better to keep your
Ladvship's picture back until after your Ladyship's marriage. It
will be published simultaneously with the account of your Ladyship's
nuptials and wedding presents in the morning papers.
Aristocratic Bride (with an unpleasant look at Mrs. PEACOCK).
I can't help feeling that Mr. KAMMEBEB is neglecting me for others.
Polite Employe. On the contrary, my Lady, Mr. KAMMERER is
most anxious to take a really popular portrait of your Ladyship.
He has ordered a special back-ground, representing the Castle in
which your Ladyship purposes spending your honey-moon.
Mrs. Peacock (with a scornful glance at Aristocratic Bride). I
must have a castle in the back-ground, too. If Mr. KAMMEBEK
does not provide one, I shall go on at once to Messrs. STHTJTT AND
STARF.LEIGH. They have been boring me for weeks to give them a
sitting.
Polite Employe. Certainly, Madam. You shall have any back-
ground you please; although Mr. KAMMERER thought that perhaps
the sea-shore would be appropriate to one of your cartes—with,
perhaps, a bathing-machine in the middle distance.
Clerical Dignitary. I hope that Mr. KAMMERER will not keep me
waiting much longer. I have a Missionary Meeting to attend, and
Polite Employe. Certainly, my Lord. I think you wish to be
taken in your vestments. (Clerical Dignitary looks displeased.) I
beg pardon. I was mixing up your Lordship with the Ritualists.
I should have said lawn-sleeves.
Miss Sallie Plantagenet, nee Sarah Snooks (enteringbriskly). Now,
then, young man, look sharp! I have got a rehearsal on at the
Revelry Theatre at eleven, and I shall only just have fifteen minutes
to slip on my togs, give the guv'nor a sitting, pop into my brougham,
and get to tne stage-door in time to save a fine.

Clerical Dignitary.} ( son a sitting before any of us!
Miss Sallie Plantagenet. Come, I say, who are you calling "a
young person"? As young as you please—but person, indeed! lam
sure my cartes sell just as well as Mrs. PEACOCK'S, or any of the
swell beauty-women; and as to the Bishop's, why he's just no-
where. But there, don't let's quarrel. I daresay this young man
will settle it for us somehow. Won't you, my dear?
Polite. Employe. Certainly, Madam, I hope your Ladyship will
excuse the delav. (To Mrs. PEACOCK and Aristocratic Bride.) Oh,
pray don't think of going, Ladies. Mr. KAMMERER will be BO
distressed, aud the Public will be so disappointed. Oh, do think of
Mr. KAMMERER and the Public!
Miss Sallie Plantagenet (good-naturedly). Don't get the poor
young man into trouble. I say—what rot our nagging like this,
when we shall all be next-door neighbours in the shop windows
for the next two years! (To Aristocratic Bride.) Look here, you
are togged already, and she (pointing to Mrs. PEACOCK) is readier
than me, as / have to make up my face and get into my never-
mention-'ems, so you two shall be taken first: and, by the time you
are done, the Reverend gent and me will be in our war-paint. There,
that's real jam! Don't you see—while KAMMERKR is knocking off
your two be-oo-tiful nobs, the Bishop can be putting on his lawn
sleeves, and I can be getting into my tights.

LOVE IN THE MIST.
A Romantic Reverie. By MTSS LACKADAY.
"Such stuff as dreams are made of."
nr.
HE always was angry when other men were kind to me. Now
that I am older, and see things more clearly, I think he must have
been jealous; but it did not occur to me then that he could have
a fault. . . .
I wish I could put him clearly before the reader; but to be clear
is always my difficulty. . . . There was nothing salient about
him—no trick, no mannerisms—no fault, as I thought then, unless
this were a fault in itself. I sometimes wondered whether it was so.
It was certainly that that made it so difficult for me to distinguish
him from the other. And the other was so vivid. He had all sorts
of ways about him that compelled you to recognise his presence—He
would stumble over the coal-scuttle as he came into the room, and
make us all start up to welcome him—Then he was irritable—and
when he was contradicted, he used to nap his coat-tails—or some-
times he would suddenly untie his neck-tie, and then MTBTLE would
go up to him in her gentle, cat-like manner, and tie it again, and
that always seemed to soothe him somehow. Then there was his
bicycle.—Altogether, he was a man you could not mistake.—It teas
a magnetism. But the other—my man I mean—I think I must call
him A., for I have forgotten his real name, and people tell me
that my style gets confused when I call them both "the other."
A. had no tricks, and no faults. If he had not always worn brown
velveteen, I should not have known him from the butler. What a
mysterious thing identity is! We all say, "I am I." But is that
all 'f—Am not I you also? Are not you tne f Does not a common
emotion make us one? Surely it must have been something of this
kind that SHAKSPEARE was thinking of, when he said, "One touch
of nature makes the whole world kin." I used to talk of this to A.
sometimes, but never could get him to understand me. There was
some dear kind sort of stupidity about him that was a barrier to
full sympathy.—I think that was what I loved him for.—I have
always felt that there is a pathos in the stupidity of kind-hearted
men—something that softens us towards them, and makes us feel
about them as we do about big dogs and cart-horses, and all the
rough, uncouth creatures that fetch and carry for us in this weary,
toiling world.
******
Poor stupid A.! Ton need not have been so jealous. In my
heart I always loved you better than clever B. But B. had a way
of coming on his bicycle that I could not resist; and besides there
was a likeness between you. It was not in figure, for he was tall
(you never were); and I don't think it was in features. But there
was a look about you both—an intensity, a hidden flash, a word, a
way! How shall I describe'it? How make people know the fasci-
nation those two men had for me, and the impossibility it was to
me to tell one from the other, till they were both gone, and I was
left alone to think it over, and over, and over. . . . Sometimes, as I
think of it, I seem to be a child in a fairy story, that has gone out
alone, and got lost.—A crowd hustles and jostles,—rough voices
swear, big feet trample, the little one begins to cry. A kind hand
stretches out, and it feels saved.—But its eyes are full of tears;
and before it can wipe them away, the hand is gone, and another is
in its place.—It cannot see this one more than the other. What does
that matter? Both are kind hands.—It loves both.—Either will
take it home. . . . Only with me both hands went at once, and I had
to come home alone.
IV.
AH. that dreary coming home! I remember the dullness in the
air when I opened my window before breakfast.—It was like the
first autumn frost, and yet it was June as usual and the roses
were in their glory. We had sat up late the night before—quarrel-
ling and forgiving, and quarrelling again. He said I was false—
that I had talked to B. from the window—that I had broken

MYRTLE'S heart. He called B. a blackguard. It was at that that I
nared up. I could not stand hearing B. abused—dear B., who was
BO clever, and whom we were always BO glad to see when he came
on his bicycle.—I took his part fiercely, and A. only grew angrier.—
But I did not mind.—I was young enough to enjoy a scene.—I think
I must have said some things that went home, for A. gave up
answering at last, and when he went out of the room he did not say
"goodnight." Poor fellow, I am afraid I wounded him—but he
should not have abused B. to me when he knew I was fond of him. . . .
I never understood what was the beginning of it all. As to my
talking to B. from the window, I did not hesitate to deny that alto-
gether. I had promised my queen to tell no one, and it was a duty
to keep my promise. Besides, I knew that she had kept hers to me.
—I would not have broken our covenant for the world.—I think if I
had, those beautiful eyes would have haunted me for ever. The
crime and the mystery would have poisoned my dreams.
* * * '* * *
We all cried at breakfast.—The children asked for A., and cried
when I said he would not come.—I felt hysterical. I was impatient
for the carriage to come, and take me away. A little three-cornered
note tumbled out of the toast-rack. The butler handed it to me
with one of his kind looks—that made me cry outright. I crumpled
up the note in my hand, and ran out of the room. I lost it somehow,
and have never known what was in it. Perhaps if 1 had, my life
might have been different!—On such slight chances do our destinies
hang! A few scratches on a scrap of paper, and two hearts are
made happy—or miserable. A post fails, and Heaven is missed. "We
tremble to think of it.
MYRTLE met me in the doorway.—She was in great disorder. Her
eyes had large red rims round them; her hands were clasped over
her head; she looked splendid, and asked me to forgive ner. I
kissed her, and sobbed "Yes." Thinking over it afterwards, I
wondered what I was to forgive her for—It seemed to me that I had
onlv to thank her—However, It does not matter—It is always sweet
to forgive and forget. . . .
* * * * * *
The house at home seemed more bustling than ever —The children
had all outgrown their clothes.—There were more of them than
usual. I asked R. to keep them out of my way.—I csuld not bear
their presence.—I was always thinking of A., and wondering what
had become of B.—This state of things lasted a whole day.—I think
I should have died if it had gone on longer. But a change came,
and we were all glad of it. The WATSONS asked us to work for a
Fancy Fair. We set to work busily. R. was a genius with her
fingers—it was a happiness to watch her. She knew how to make
something out of everything—out of nothing! The tiniest scraps
were of use to her—the most hopeless rubbish grew hopeful in her
hands. I used to bring her all the odds and ends I could find—old
lucifer-matches, broken bottles, corks, cigar-ends, and dead leaves
from the garden. She transmuted them all—infusing into each
something of her own bright being. ...
It was while we were busy in this way that I had a second note
from A. Poor fellow, it was a very tender little note, just like
himself. He said he was afraid he had been hasty, and had not
given me time to explain. Would I write to him? or might he
come and see me? He called me his " dearest," and signed himself
my " devoted and penitent A." I cried as I read the note, and felt
that I loved him better than ever. I meant to answer by the first
post; but somehow I grew absorbed in watching R. at her work.
She was making a cockchafer out of a champagne-cork—it was so
soothing to see her dainty fingers twisting the wires into antenna;,
and poking holes for the eyes. In watching her, I forgot every-
thing—sudaenly the clock struck six. It was too late to write
that day. I thought of Cinderella, and how her clock struck. . , .
I meant to write next day-—but again I was busy, and again I let
the post go, without a word for A. Then the whole thing went out
of my head—I was getting so happy over the bazaar, that I could
think of nothing else till it was finished—Then I remembered again,
and looked for the note, but it was gone—Unfortunately, I could
not recall his address, and so I have never been able to write—
Poor A.! That is how the Prince vanished out of my Fairy tale,
and I had to come home alone.
******
The children are tired of waiting for their tea.—I rouse myself
from my dreams—They crowd round my chair—they have broken
all the willow-pattern plates, and eaten the butter from the
muffins—they tell me so laughing, and I laugh with them. The
Landlady comes in with dusters — It is bed-time — The children
are asleep already.—I shall be soon.—Good night, my friends!

SOCIAL SCIENCE AND SUNDAY.

f\UERY — By what means
II can good examples of
V* Art be brought within
the reach of the population
of small towns and villages '<
Anstrei — In a measure, by
providing Sunday and other
parish schools, and Work-
men's Clubs, with models,
fittings, furniture, and pot-
tery, of good shapes. Re-
spondent, Mr. T. C. HOHS-
i'ALL, of Manchester, in a
paper read in the Art Section
of u.the Social Science Con-
gress at Cheltenham, thus
ending :—
"But, above all, if English
people are to live with pictures,
and learn to think of pictures,
they must be enabled to give
part of Sunday to the study of
pictures and the lessons taught
fay them. (' Sear, hear ! ')
Picture Galleries and Museums
should be opened on Sunday,
and, to make them more attrac-
tive, music should be intro-
duced."
Mr. HAYWOOD, also of Manchester, recommended the Art Gallery
of Birmingham, open on Sundays, as an example to other towns,
especially because such institutions were "counteracting influences
to the attraction of the dram-shop." And —
"The Rev. Mr. ROBERTS thought the English observance of the Sabbath
was rather Jewish than Christian. The spirit and example of our Saviour
himself was of a more cheerful character. ('Hear, hear!') Ho himself
walked in the fields on the Sabbath, and taught hia disciples that the Sabbath
was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. (' Hear, hear ! ') If the
exhibition of Art of a refining and elevating kind would keep people from the
public-houses, they ought not to frown upon or discourage such exhibitions.
(' Hear, hear .' ')"
Hear an enlightened divine. Only take his divinity with just
half a grain of salt. English Sabbatarian observance of Sunday
is, in fact, neither altogether Christian nor exactly Jewish. Our
Sabbatarian brethren observe the first instead of the seventh day of
the week: and that with breaches for which, had they so broken
the Jewish Sabbath, the Jews of old would have stoned them.
Nevertheless their manner of observing their Sabbath so-called is so
nearly Judaic as quite to justify the statement that it is rather Jewish
than Christian. If this were all, it would be of no consequence to
anybody but themselves; but they are not content, for their own
part, with regarding Sunday as the Sabbath, and considering man
made for the Sabbath, and not the Sabbath for man. They endea-
vour with all their ability to enforce such an observance of what
they call their Sabbath, that in all of our towns with but few excep-
tions — amongst which honour to Birmingham — there exist on that
Hope for the New Egyptian Loan.
"Among the documents upon which the loan has been negotiated, we be-
lieve, is a letter from Mr. MONEY, C.B., the English Controller of the Daira
Estates, who was requested to make a special examination of the property
given up by the KHBDIVB and his family. His account is that in the last
two years the net revenue has exceeded £700,000 per annum. That though
the past administration of the estates has been wasteful and extravagant to
the last degree, with proper management they will yield even more than the
actual revenue for the last two years."
THEN there is " Money " in it.

his equals and smiling with those below him; he is peremptory in his orders
after having been docile as regards the advice he asked. He expresses him-
self with equal ease in the languages of most who come in contact with him;
he loves the arts, hunting, arms, beauty under all its forms; he is neither
unbending nor compliant; he will endure no stain in those who surround
him, nor does he enforce any hypocrisy on those who serve him. lie has a
communicative gaiety, a vigour enhanced by elegance; he is natural in his
princely bearing; he amuses himself when he wishes to do so; he can be
sumptuous without being prodigal; he remembers men and thinks; he is
firm and liberal; he detests all that is exclusive, likes a straightforward
policy, is a staunch friend and frank adversary. He is cast, in short, in the
mould whence great popular figures in France have issued—the Henry the
Fourths, the Francis the Firsts—a seductive mixture of excellences and
foibles, tigainst whose candidatures Republicans and Royalties collapse, and
who are borne on the wave of popular movements. Happily for the Republic,
and also I hope for England, this Prince is not a Frenchman, and is not a
candidate."—rimes Paris Correspondent.
La Republique loquitur.
An yes, this is better. Quelle journee.' Ma foil
Such partners are pleasant; my step they have caught.
This is really a very superb pat de troit,
And should furnish my enemies matter for thought.
They think—quelle idee.'—that the tierce Carmagnole
Or low can-can are all I am fitted to dance.
But a Prince and a Marshal for partners! Quel role.'
They '11 allow that this figure is worthy of France.
Houp, Marechal! Bravo! A leetle bit stiff—
Mfnuct de la cour might be more in his line.
But he goes, and, considering our late little tiff,
Has fairly adjusted his footing to mine.
He cries " Tout va bien.'" and steps briskly—though this
Is not quite the pat he expected, perchance.
Man cifttx.' you 've behaved, I '11 admit, not amiss,
And fall in, faute de mieux, with the fashion of France.
Man Prince! No, not mine, though I almost could say—
Halte-ld! La Republique must not take that tone,
But a partner more pleasant, more active, and gay
No Lady could wish. His step "s light as my own,
At not even pat-risque nor can-can he '11 wince,
Chaste:, croisez,—how gaily he follows the dance!
Mafoi.' if one could be fpris of a Prince.
This brave Prince de Oalles were the fancy of France.
Our OWTI Correspondent! Could flunkeyish soul
Up-pile panegyric in style more profuse?
To such sugar as that, I should think, on the whole,
The frank Prince would prefer the most acid abuse.
HENRI Q.UATEE! Le vert galant.' Faith—he had need,
With cet dames pulling caps for his hand in the dance;
Brisk in work as in play. He 's the man to succeed
In winning, though Prince, the affection of France.
May this gay pat de trots prove an augury fair
Of union at home, as of peace with his land,
Who, Prince though he be, with such grace debonair
So frankly could give the Republic his hand.
And, Marshal, in v dear, you may cast aside fear,
Now Royalty snares the Republican dance,
We may foot it together for many a year,
If you '11 just leave the choice of the figure to France.

FRIENDS AT A DISTANCE.
Being the brief record of a few Winter-seasonable Visits to certain
Country Houses.
CHAPTER I.
The accidental meeting—Spontaneous imitation—Hesitation—Deci-
sion — Explanation — Instruction — Suggestions — Insulting a
tried companion—The bag—The address—More next time.
ABOUT this time 1 manage to give a few friends the benefit of my
presence. I did it last year. I have begun again.
My friend, JOSSLYN DYKE, is jealous of my other old friend,
BOODELS of Boodels. JOSSLYN DYKE complains that, whenever I do
go anywhere, I always visit BOODELS of Boodels at Boodels. The
repartee is evident, "' Then ask me, mv dear JOSSLYN. Whistle,
and I '11 come to you, my lad,"—which last quotation, by the way,
is inscribed on a Cab-call presented to me on my birthday. The
instrument in question is pretty on a watch-chain, and amusing as
a puzzle, but its practical working is a failure. It is, " Blow your
whistle! I won't come to you, my lad!" This is merely avis OKX
siffleurs.
JOSSLYN DYKE replies, warmly, " Come the day after to-morrow."
This is sudden: but it is " now or never " with JOSSLYN. I am
all for " now." and I accept.
"Capital!'' says JOSSLYN, as heartily as before; "that's first
rate."
Then he pauses, and puts his head on one side, as if considering a
difficulty. 1 make a pretence of being uninterested, hut I own to a
misgiving about his invitation. It was given readily, it was as
readily accepted. It was offered carelessly; it was received with
caution.
"Hum!" he says, dubiously, as if turning it over in his mind,
"let me see—I "m going to the THOMPSON BONHAMS on—ah"
This sounds as though he were going to the THOMPSON BONHAMS
on the very day of my arrival. But I've accepted. Ergo: Put off
the THOMPSON BONHAMS. I make no observation, thinking it better
for him to arrange his own affairs with himself, and leave mine to
myself. My affair is that I am going down to stay with him, and,
however he may treat the THOMPSON BONHAMS, / am not going to
beput off.
He goes on soliloquising—" Yes, let me see—if I don't go to them
then—\ can write and say that—yes—if you come down on Monday,"
—I brighten up at this—I foresee a pleasant week—" Yes, if you
come down on Monday—then I can go to the THOMPSON BONHAMS on
Thursday—that will suit you, eh?"
"Oh, yes," I reply, considerably damped by the sudden curtail-
ment of my projected visit.
It seems as though he were calculating my cost per diem, or that
it had suddenly occurred to him how tired he might possibly become
of me in two days' time, and what a loophole was at once offered
him by the THOMPSON BONHAMS' engagement.
JOSSLYN DYKE, having concluded his soliloquy, and very nearly
made his fixtures for the next few days, continues, as we walk
along: "The fact is," he says, confidentially, "the country's
charming, delightful in the summer," he emphasises "summer"
strongly, when my house is full—lots of pretty people and pretty
dresses, you know—and the birds are singing, and all the flowers
are at their brightest and sweetest"—(quite a poet is J OSSLYN! only
I cannot avoid the thought that flashes across me, " If it were sucn
a Paradise in summer, why the deuce didn't he ask me there when
there were, as he says, lots of pretty people and pretty dresses?"
However, J '11 keep this—I '11 brooo. over it—till we nave a cosy
tete-d-tete in his snuggest of snug smoking-rooms), "but now,"
he goes on, "when all the leaves are falling, when the fogs rise and
steal up the garden-walks like chilled ghosts of the past"
"My dear fellow!" 1 remonstrate, you 're romancing. It can't
be so bad as that." How about my bargain, and my pleasant time
at his country house, if he 's going to have foggy ghosts stealing up
the garden walks'(
"0 yes, it is," he insists. "You see, at four o'clock, one is only
too glad to close the shutters, draw the curtains, put on the logs,
light gas and candles everywhere we can. and keep out the shadows
of the night and the sort of churchyard damp that will stream in
through the chinks and crannies of the old house in spite of every-
thing."
"Ah!" I say, endeavouring to divert him from his present
gloomy line of thought. What's the matter with him? He is tall,
rather a chubby-faced, or cherub-faced, man, guiltless of moustache
and whisker except for a little bit that seems to have slipped down
from under his hair on each side, and been fastened on flat with gum,
and broad shoulders with just the slightest stoop. I have always
heard of him as being, or as having been (and quite recently, too),
dauntless as a lion in the cricket-field (a lion in the cricket-field
would be the only dauntless one there, if the other dauntless ones
had any sense—so it is a good simile after all), and a hero at lawn-
tennis.
"Ah!" I exclaim, cheerily. "Yes, yours is an old house, a very
old house, isn't it?"
"Yes," he begins. But I am afraid of his harking back to his
former theme, and I cut him short with—
"I love an old house, whether in England or abroad!" I 've not
seen very many anywhere, except when in process of demolition for
'Metropolitan Improvements;' but inference, and not accuracy, is
the point when conversation has to be made. In fact, an originator
of conversation should drop vague hints, calculating on the probable
inferences to be drawn from them by his auditors, who will then
keep up the interest for themselves. This process might be called
the Inferential Calculus. This is a note by the way.
"I love old houses!" I go on enthusiastically. I feel I must be
enthusiastically joyous with a man so depressed as JOSSLYN. Odd
that he should be taken like this immediately after giving me my
invitation. Is it repentance? Regret?
"An old house is so cheerful in winter," I say; and here it occurs
to me that I will give him a hint, and oppose ghosts with real flesh
and blood—" I mean it is so lively, when there are about half-a-
dozen pleasant people "—is half-a-dozen enough? I ought to have
asked more, and then he would have come down to that—I retrace
my steps carefully—"half-a-dozen, or a dozen; according, of course,"
I am careful to add, " to the size of the house. A tew Ladies to
brighten up the scene. Then the chat round the fire "—somehow I
can't get away from the fire. Whenever I begin with my ideal of the
cheeriness of a country house in winter, the fire is the centre, as it
were, of my system, and I invariably picture everybody sitting round
it all day long, as though really afraid for their very lives to move
away, lest they should be frozen to death, I leave this inference,
however, for him: only, as far as 1 've gone, my sketch does not pre-
sent that idea of hearty joviality with which it had been my object
to impress him. Sitting round a fire the whole day is more sugges-
tive of a purring, sleepy, stupid state, than of rollicking country-
house amusement. I determine to throw more spirit into my
description, just to encourage him to ask some pleasant people; for
if he doesn't, and if he is going to be as gloomy as he is just now, I
shall begin to regret I accepted JOSSLYN'S invitation.
"Yes," I continue, "some lively people, all bright and cheery
round the breakfast-table in the morning—the freshest, merriest
meal of the day!"
"Ah !" he interrupts, "I hate breakfast in the morning!"
When would he have it then? In the evening?
No; he meant it seriously. He wouldn't, he says, have it at all.
Personally, he doesn't have it for himself, only for his guesta.
I am compelled, out of deference to my future host, to tone down
this brilliant colouring at the commencement of the day, and go on
to the next step.
"Well," I admit, as if convinced by his manner, more than his

arguments, and in a general way deferring to his better sense and
greater experience (always in view of him as my future host),
"Well, there is something in what you say. A row and a noise in
the morning is not good; it's exhausting. But then afterwards—
the first pipe, for example, after breakfast—ah—ah!" and I try to
represent, in action, what rapture is mine when smoking my first pipe
in the morning.
"Ah!" says JOSSLYN, most seriously, "I detest smoking early
in the morning; I only smoke at night: last thing."
"Indeed!" I exclaim: and for a few second!) I haven't any-
thing further to say. I am a trifle shaken in my notions of
the jollity of JOSSLYN as a companion; but I think it best to " go
with him," so to speak, as far as I can, and (still in view of being
my future host) by an effort I recover this blow—for it i» a blow,
when a man who is to be your host and companion, differs from
you on such an essential point as the first pipe in the morning—
and say—
""Well, possibly you 're right—it suits me—but one can't legislate
for others —-(I wish I could)—" but then that's not the only plea-
sure "—(and I quite pick up again as I begin to picture to myself a
brilliant society at JOSSLYN'S house)—" there are the Ladies"
"Never look well in winter," he says, shaking his head, then
adds—" and so difficult to get the right ones. Hate girls."
What age is JOSSLYN? I '11 go and talk him over with a friend.
At present my object is to show I'm the "Cornerless Man," who
will fit in everywhere and anywhere.
\Happy Thought.—Capital name for a story, The Cornerless Man.
Also, good idea for an Advertisement:—
WANTED, by a CORNERLESS MAN, several pleasant COUNTRY-
HOUSES to stop at during the Winter Months. Hunting and Shooting
Quarters not to much an object as agreeable Society, and all found. No ob-
jection to travel in perfectly fine weather, and the sea like a lake.—Address
C. At., Somebody Else's Chambers, No. 1 (which number he is at present
engaged in taking care of).]
"Yes," I own to JOSSLYN, "you are right. It is difficult to select
exactly the people. But you have always plenty ready and willing
to come down to you. Then "—(I go on with my ideal country-house
and its joys)—" there's riding, or perhaps hunting, or a walk out
and a drive back"
"And walk back," he corrects me quickly, so that there should be
o misunderstanding, no accepting on false expectations. "I don't
keep any horses or carriages.
"No—but"—(I suggest, as possible)—" a pony-trap"
"No trap at all," says JOSSLYN, decisively.
I am about to recover myself with greater difficulty this time, as I
foresee not being met at the Station, which is an omission I detest,
and am trying to pump up some fatuous remark about walking
being better for the health, and so forth, when he takes up the con-
versation, and says—
"No; out of the summer, it's a very dull place, and I'm only
too glad of anyone coming down to talk to me."
The deuce!
"But I shan't have any one else there, because if two fellows come,
they talk to one another, and not to me; and they go out together,
and leave me at home, because I don't walk much now. No;" he
goes on becoming more contented with the prospects of my being
down there alone, and, so to speak, in his power; "we will have
the place to ourselves. It's an enormous old nouse. I shut up most
of the rooms when there's nobody there, and occupy one; that'll
be quite enough for us." "Oh, quite!" I say; but my heart fails m«,
and my mind misgives.
"You'11 see what a strange, queer old ghostly place it is: some
terrible legend to every room in _the house. That s what's you'll
enjoy."
He is now quite lively again, as he bids me good-bye, and tells
me he shall certainly expect me the day after to-morrow. In
answer to my question about the line and station, he informs me
that I start from Fenchuroh Street Station. Fenchureh Street! Oh!
I almost exclaim. Couldn't he make it anywhere else? If there is
a station I detest—but, no matter, it is too late now—I have accepted
—and it mayn't be so far, after all,—only to begin with Fenchureh
Street Station on a foggy, mizzly, dull, damp November afternoon—

A PUBLIC NUISANCE.
FANCY PORTRAIT OF THE PARTY WHO WILL DEFACE THE BOOKS FROM THE
CIRCULATING LIBRARY, BY SCORING UNDER THE PASSAGES HE APPROVES OF
WITH A LEAD PENCIL, AND WRITING THE WORD "Bosa" ON THE MARGIN
WHEN HE DISAPPROVES.
THE JINGO-ENGLISHMAN.
(New Version, of an old Song, adapted to the tastes of the
Patriot of the Period.)
THERE 's a Land that's Cock of Creation's walk,
Though it is but a tiny isle,
And to hear its brag, and its tall tall talk,
Might make e'en Bombastes smile.
It holds itself holiest, first in fight,
Most brave, most wise, most strong,
And will ne'er admit what it fancies right
Can by any chance be wrong.
'Tis the pink of perfection, deny it who can,
The Home of the Jingo Englishman!
There's a Flag that floats o'er every sea,
And claims to control the brine;
And if any dare hint that it makes too free,
The result is a deuce of a shine.
For the bouncing boys who walk the deck
Deem the Ocean their own little lot,
And if foreign fools at their pride should check,
They will catch it exceedingly hot.
Right-divine's in its bunting, deny it who can,
Is the Flag of the Jingo-Englishman!
There's a Heart that leaps with a generous glow
A paying cause to defend,
Lets interest rule it in fixing a foe,
And profit in choosing a friend.
It nurtures a deep and abiding love
For possession of power and pelf,
And deems that the duty all otners above
Is enshrined in that sweet word " self."
'Tis a rare tough organ, deny it who can,
The Heart of your Jingo-Englishman!
The Briton may traverse the Pole or the Zone,
And annex on sea or shore;
He calls an immense domain his own,
But he means going in for more.
Let the wandering stranger seek to know
To what charter such rights" are owed,
And a flush will rise to the Briton's brow
As he answers—" You be blowed!"
There's no end of a pull, deny it who can.
In the words, "I 'm a Jingo-Englishman!"
as a place to start from (better, in that aspect, thank Heaven!
than as a place where we might be forced to stop!!) is not an
encouraging prospect.
"From Fenchurch Street," he explains (and he thinks it a charm-
ing station; far better, he says, than Paddington, or St. Pancras,
or Liverpool Street—oh! far better!—so much more convenient;
yes, for where he wants to go) "you take the train"—or, more cor-
rectly speaking, the train takes me; for I couldn't take a train
anywhere without making a dreadful mess of it—" the train takes
you," continues JOSSLYX, "to Bursted Mills. There you get out."
'' Yes; and take a fly for your place," I say, with ready intelligence.
I am wrong, JOSSLYN explains. I do not take a fly. Does a fly
take me? No," JOSSLYN replies, with such gravity, that I at
once become seriously attentive. Another train comes up on a loop-
line, and tlint takes me to Clogsole and Clayboro'; and this last is
his, JOSSLYN DYKE'S, Station.
I feel as glad as though I were there already.
'' There is sure to be, he informs me, "some one there to carry your
bag "—he has evidently decided on the limit to my luggage, and
my stay—" and if there isn't, you can walk up through the village;
and I can send the Gardener down, if he hasn't gone away. But,
he adds, in a hopeful tone, "we '11 manage—somehow."
I detest this expression when applied to dealings with my bag.
"Love me, love my bag," is my motto as a traveller, and if I don t
care about being treated "somehow," much less do I like to think
of my bag having to rough it in that sort of manner. After all,
what am I without my bag? What is any man, travelling, without
his bag? Absolutely nothing. And knowing this as well as every
one with any experience must do, nothing irritates me more, or
more justly—as it should irritate every right-minded, honest, self-
respecting person—than to hear a host, or a butler, or any servant, but
specially a nost, say carelessly, " Oh, your bag will be all right. It'll
come up somehow. And, if it doesn't, we can easily send for it"
No, I do not like this prospect as presented by JOSSLYN; and from
this moment I have one fixed determination for this visit, and that
is, Not on any account to part with my Bag!
I reserve these remarks, and do not tell JOSSLYN how he has
wounded a sensitive nature.
"And the name of your place—I forget exactly ?" I ask.
"Here it is—on my card. I thought you knew," he replies.
"The Mote, Moss-End. It's about three miles from the station."
Happy Thought.—More Re-mote than Mote. But I mustn't ven-
ture on a jest about the name of a man's place, where his forefathers
and foremothers may have lived for centuries. But yet, wasn't he
disrespectful to my bag? He won't be when he sees it. Boy carry my
bag, indeed! I should like to see the Boy who could carry the bag that
I 'm going to take down with me to The Mote Moss-End. That Boy
would have to be a young Hercules. JOSSLYN little suspects that in
that bag of mine I can pack things sufficient to last me for three
months at a time! I 'm an old carpet-bagger, and patent packing
has been my study for years. But, ne will see. I shall arrive—the
Cornerless Man with the Carpet-Bag!
We part. And the day after to-morrow will see me—if the day
after to-morrow only looks out sharp enough, and isn't too foggy—
down at The Mote Moss-End, chez JOSSLYN DYKE. Au revoir 1
(To be continued.)
THE RIGHT MAN IN THE RIGHT PLACE.
MR. C. R. Low closes his panegyric on Sir GAKNET WOLSELEY,
just published, with this proud peroration:—
"Young in years, yet ripe with a military experience almost unrivalled in
the British Army; blessed with an equable temperament and an iron consti-
tution; . . . Rifted with sound judgment and a thorough mastery of the art
of war, theoretically as culled from books, and practically as studied and illus-
trated in all climes and under varied conditions; possessing a chivalric
courage that has extorted the admiration of witnesses, and conBdence in him-
self, combined with that attribute which is an unerring indication of the
presence of genius—a faculty for inspiring confidence in others."
Surely he is now in the very place to show his iron constitution,
his equable temperament, and his faculty for inspiring confidence
in others. All together may help to account for his courageous
attempt — in a private letter, of which extracts appear in this
month's Macmiuan—to inspire a confidence in Cyprus and its pros-
pects!

Your deafening

Your horrible

If of me it don't

Much pleasanter

The new peal that swings
In the opposite turret,
To call folks to prayer,
And not just striie the hours,
As I do, here, in air.
And at the new peal's faults,
If HAWKIS is railer,
As 'twas cast by no Jielge,
But a true British Taylor,
On the whole, one may say—
And / haven't a doubt on't—
That the new ring o' Bells
Has eome very well out on't.
Then, of course, as a Bell

And leave SCRIBBLERS' bob-majors,

About HA WEIS'S letter
Whatever I feel,
/don't have my head turned,
Like you, by a Peal.
Since o'er my first casting
I heard BECKKTT groan,
At least, I can boast
Of a PEEL of my own—
A PEEL, and a CANNING,
A PALMERSTON too,
And a DERBY besides,
At my feet that kotoo.
And o'er PEKL, PAM, and DERBY,
I know very well,
Be my voice what it may,
I, at least, bear the hell.
I look down on 'em all,
As you look on Uucen ANNE,
And leave BECKETT and HAVVEIS
To clash, pot and pan.
You are ax good a Bell,
As the City has claim to,
With its Bulls and Bears crippled
And Ducks plucked and lame too.
And if my voice ain't sound—
Well, it's one folks can hear;
That's the voice that should sound
lu the Parliament's ear.
There's another BEN yonder
Will soon have to try
If he can make his voice
As well heard as I.

THE thick black fog of Westminster hung heavily
over the Council Chamber of the British Cabinet on this
ominous afternoon, and, as the Ministers entered one by
one in stealthy silence and the door closed with an iron
clang, it soon became clear that no common business was
about to be discussed.
The beetle-browed BEACONSFIELD, glittering through
the gloom with insignia, the fruits of his Berlin
chicanery, was the first to speak.
'' Well, Messieurs les Mimstres" he said, with a Machia-
vellian laugh, " the mighty civilising power of the North
is again alive to our machinations. Can you tell me how
we are to oppose it this time?" He struck the table as
he spoke, and there was a strange gleam of suggestion
in his eye.
The Ministers held their breath.
"Will it be by ships f" he asked, suddenly, darting
a lurid glance in the direction of Lord SMITH, the
Chancellor of the Admiralty.
"Certainly not," was the prompt reply. "Their hulls
are wormeaten. their crews mutinous for arrears of pay.
You must not look to our ships."
The official paled as he spoke, and his voice trembled
slightly. He had spent the whole of the twenty-seven
millions, voted for two years' naval estimates, on furnish-
ing his villa at Highbury.
The story, however, was not new to his colleagues.
They were accustomed to Government corruption. The
PRIME MINISTER merely smiled, and proceeded—
"Will it be by men ?" he asked, turning to the Grand
Minister of War with the indifference of one who antici-
pates the answer.
"Does a brand new Karl ask the price of a British
coronet?" was the insolent but convincing retort. It
was the Count of CHANBROOK who spoke; and report
said that he had purchased his title from the Duke of
CAMBRIDGE for a fabulous sum which should have been
spent on facings for a line regiment. The Ministers
looked from one to the other, and the subject dropped.
Their chief continued—
"Then if it's not to be by sea or land, by ships or
men, by what is it to be?" His voice sank lower, and
his audience read his meaning in his eye with the swift
instinct of habit. There was a momentary pause. Then,
like one man, they sprang on to the seats of their chairs.
"Poison!" they all shouted together.
"Poison! LYTTON shall breakfast with the Ameer,
disguised as a travelling dervish — and put it in his
coffee!"
*****
That afternoon the Cabinet Council was dissolved,
and, a few hours later, a carefully-packed box, con-
taining an assortment of bal manquf dresses, a few con-
juring tricks, a coifee-pot, an Afghan dictionary, and
two pounds of Vermin Destroyer (with directions for use
in cypher), was on its way to the Viceroy of British
India.
That box has arrived. The sequel alone remains to
be told in the tragic language of history!

A HOME IN THE QALTEES.
"TlS SWEET TO KNOW THERE IS AN EYE WILL MARK
OUR COMING, AND LOOK BRIGHTER WHEN WE COME."—Byron,
WHO KNOWS BEST?
(A Qu&tion for the Commissioners)
SCENE—The Interior of a Famous City Church.
Enter two Strangers.
First Stranger (looking round). Ah! the old walls still
stand, and time has dealt gently with the work. Faith
it was goodly work; and even now bears on it the stamp
of that vanished age I
Second Stranger. Vanished age f What do you mean,
Sir P Where's your past here?
First Stranger. Past? Hethinks, my good Sir, that
the epoch which saw this noble City rise, Phoenix-like,
from its ashes, might be held worthy of its memorials.
This church, for instance
Second Stranger. Just so; and we are going to restore
it—rather!
First Stranger. I am glad to hear it. The land-marks
of olden days should not be lost.
Second Stranger. Precisely. That's our motto. So
we 're going to get rid of all that rubbishing old carv-
ing, scrape the chancel, pitch-pine the nave, sink the
floor, throw up the roof, pierce the sides, cut the whole
in half, then turn what's left inside-out, finishing off
with a dozen coats of pink and pea-green—and there
you are!
First Stranger (coldly). And you term this restoration?
Second Stranger (warmly). And ain't it? It's our
firm's business. Our Governor 'a got dozens of churches
in hand.
First Stranger. The process likes me not. Methinks
it savours foully of sacrilege.
Second Stranger. Sacrilege! What do you mean.
Sir P Why, we 're the Restorers.' And who, I should
like to know, are you P
First Stranger. The Architect.'
l_Sir Christopher's ghost vanishes.
Poet and Prophet.
UTONS, bard of Scotia's braes and banks,
Foretold Directors' recent pranks,
Though nane wad tent it—
And vet his verse each scribbler quotes—
"A chiel 's amang ye takin' notes."
Sae it stands prentit!
A RESPITE FOR ROGUES.
You suspect your grocer, chandler, or general-dealer of having
watered his rum, sanded his sugar, wetted his tobacco, substituted
potato-starch for arrowroot, or mingled heterogeneous matters of any
description with his tea, coffee, tobacco, snuff, vinegar, and pepper.
You wish to ascertain whether or no these suspicions are just, to the
intent of pulling up a possibly dishonest tradesman under the Food
and Drugs Act of 1875.
You repair to his shop, you purchase a sample of a suspected
article, and take it away to get it analysed. Or you employ a
Sanitary Inspector, or some other professional analyst, to procure
and test it. But, by a special provision of the Act above named, the
purchaser having made nis purchase, is required to tell the vendor
that the sample has been purchased for the purpose of analysis.
Another clause of that Act provides that, to constitute an in-
fringement of it, the sale of an adulterated article must be made
to the prejudice of the purchaser. What prejudice can you have
sustained from the purchase of a thing which you have bought
merely for the purpose of experiment P The worse the better for
that. Fiat experimentum in corpore rili. Of course, a fortinri, an
adulterated article cannot bo bought by any professional analyst,
in his professional capacity, to his own prejudice.
So says common logic. "So do the Lord Chief Justice of England,
the Justiciary Appeal Court of Scotland, and Sir JAMES INGHAM,
Stipendiary Archbeak, read the Food and Drugs Act of 1875. His
Worship, following their Lordships, "has decided that the selling
of adulterated milk to a Sanitary Inspector is not an infringement
of the Act, inasmuch as the sale is not made to the prejudice of
the purchaser." (See The Lancet.} Here 's "a go !" as the school-
boys say. Every conviction obtained during three years under that
Act is wrong; and every rogue, however deservedly fined, has,
been fined illegally. Whether or no the rogues could recover the
amount of their tines, may be a question which the legal sages
might or might not also rule in their favour.
So, then, Clause 14 (the Rogues' Clause) of the Food and Drugs
Act simply makes that enactment of none effect.
As early as possible next Session, of course, the Act will be ex-
purgated of the provision which renders it a dead letter. In the
meanwhile, dear friends and consumers, mind with whom you deal •
for. of course, between this and then fraudulent shopkeepers will
endeavour to make all the bad hay they can whilst their malinc sun
shines.
HONOUR r. RIGHT.
(A Conscientious War-Song.)
FEOM SHERE ALI we 've met with a snub and rebuff,
For which we, perhaps, gave him reason enough;
But, because we 've not used him as well as we ought,
'Twill ne'er do to permit him to set us at naught.
We have made a mistake; true, but what's done is done;
And we 're bound to proceed in the way once begun;
Right or wrong, never mind—we must go in to win;
Nor care more than King RICHAKD, though sin pluck on sin.
There is much on the other side, needs we must own,
To be said for our letting this Ameer alone;
But " prestige" we may lose by forbearing to fight,
So we can't ieel quite sure the wise course is the right.
To be just and fear nought may be policy sound,
As between man and man—but it won't do all round;
Christian ethics our conduct in private may rule,
But the Statesman whose acts they restrain is a fool.
Let's be bold, ever bold—we are out of harm's way—
Whilst from battle and murder deliverance we pray.
That's in church; but man's blood without stint must be shed,
When a loss of "prestige" we have reason to dread.
There's one fear a Briton can own without shame,
That's the fear of risking the national fame;
Britain's Lion is brave as a Lion can be,
If bis courage were moral no Lion were he.

\£s, MR. HKSSEMER, IT w HAP.D ON THE "LEGION OF HONOUR;" BUT CONSIDER THE "SPARKS" IF TOU ONCE LIT UP SUCH
A CENTRE-PIECE!
AN IMPROVEMENT.
HONG-KONG is not the only place in which our negotiators at
Berlin are to be duly recognised. Our great National Prophets are
to be honoured in their own country. We have received the pros-
pectus of a movement for a national presentation to the Earls of
BEACONSFIELD and SALISBURY. It is to take the form of "hand-
some testimonials," in silver, representing "Peace with Honour,"
to cost £1,000 each. Subscriptions not to exceed 10«. Bd.
"Peace," we are told, is to be represented by Corn-fields, with the
Lion lying down with the Lamb; "Honour," by British Soldiers, with
the British Flag, and either BRITANNIA or a figure with a wreath of
laurel.
This design—Punch takes leaves to remark—seems open to improve-
ment. For "Peace," he would suggest, say a loving-cup chased with
scenes of Bosnian and Bulgarian massacre, and Macedonian and
Albanian insurrection. On the cover a group representing the
AMEER and Lord LTTTON squaring at each other. For " Honour,"
Lord SALISBURY signing the Secret Schouvaloff Convention, and
BRITANNIA putting Cyprus in her pocket. Round the base garters
intertwined, with the motto:
"She did love to sec you cross-gartered."

BOBN, 1806. DIED, NOVEMBER, 1878.
So falls the last of the brave troop who fought
A good fight for a nobler, statelier Stage;
When young hearts, voung hopes swelled to the high thought
Of spells that should renew the Drama's age:
That bright hope grew, took shape, and of it came
Great plays of old, presented with new power;
Purer one theatrOj at least, became.
And all was quickened life for a brief hour.
Swift as it rose the light began to wane,
When they that could best aid to it have given,
Set faces hard, and thought of pence to gain.
More than of Art, that 'gainst the tide had striven.
And when the chief of that foiled enterprise
Laid down his truncheon, this man did not fear
With smaller force, and in less stately guise,
To hold the same good fight for many a year.
Lifting rude hearers from their rough disport
To rare, invoking SHAKSPEARE'S magic spell
To work its wonders on the baser sort,
The downward bent of joyless souls to quell.
Bringing all Beauty, Terror. Tenderness,
Fantasy's wildest freaks, Mirth's brightest face,
Humour's most potent charm, athwart the stress
Of all Life has of sordid, foul, and base.
And nightly, year on year, with brief stage-cheat,
Out of a workday world, poor, grim, and grey,
Bearing the crowd on Art's wings, wide as fleet,
To fairer lives, and realms of sunnier day.
For eighteen years who knows how much of hope,
Grace, sweetness, aspiration, this man's art
Has sown or strengthened, imped what wings, to cope
With downward drag of counter, street, and mart;
Set what founts flowing, ope'd what windows wide,
Done what schoolwork, as school but rarely can?
On all this he might well look back with pride,
As one who had wrought well in cause of man.
No common Actor either, he could reach
A range of various parts, from grave to gay:
With simple touches probe the heart, and teach
By pause, hand, look, what words are weak to say.
None better gave the struggle of strong will
With yearning heart: * none with move power portrayed
The loving father,t hardening himself still,
Till by the voice of nature overswayed.
His name brings back the mad Midsummer Dream,
And ass's head of the Athenian Clown:
With him as Fahtaff in Eastcheap we seem
To feed HaFs laugh, and wither at his frown.
But less, just now, behoves us call to mind
All that the Actor was, than fairly tell
How much his work of managing combined, .
To earn good word from those who wish men well.
Honest and hearty, howso curt and gruff,
None knew but to respect the sterling soul,
To learn that deep down in his gnarldd stuff
Lay a soft core oeneath the rugged bole.
Farewell to him, and honour to his work,
Done years ago, but not yet passed away:
Whose growths in unexpected places lurk,
To bless and cheer, to solace and to stay.

CAUSATION OR COINCIDENCE?
CONTRIBUTORS TO

drunkenne-s had rather increased thnn diminish
That intemperance should have gone
IN the course of an
exceptionally sen-
sible speech deli-
vered the other day
at a Church Temper-
ance meeting, in the
Sheldonian Theatre,
at Oxford, Lord ABER-
DA_RE appropriately
reminded his nearera
that—
"He knew that n
number of persons had
been moved to take the
pledge of total ahgti-
nence that Bands of Hope
had been formed all
over the country, and
that mrwt eloquent voices
had been raised in every
tswn, showing the evil>
of intemperance and the
advantaged of temper-
ance. Yet, in spite of
all, the? had to make
tho melancholy admis-
sion that, on the whole,
during the last ten years
on increasing simul-
taneously with agitation and declamation designed to diminish it, is
surely a remarkable coincidence. Does not the coincidence suggest
a possible causation? May not the subject of intemperance nave
been something too much and too intemperately talked about for the
interests of temperance? Has not the talk perhaps provoked reaction
and opposition f And does not Lord ABKRDAKE point out a much
more excellent way? According to the report above quoted—
"In conclusion, Lord ABERDARE advocated the encouragement of the study
of music, and the establiaUment of working-men's clubs and coffee-houses."
Are not these conditions precisely similar to those under which the
upper classes turned from tipsy to temperate, of their own accord,
without talk and temperance agitation to urge them Y Would not
Temperance Societies do better in endeavouring to counteract the
attraction of public-houses than in trying to close them? To a
certain extent, no doubt, people can be made sober by Act of Parlia-
ment. They could be, as they used to be in some measure made
sober by being put in the stocks for getting drunk. Sots can be
made sober, as rogues can be made honest; but what, then is the
honesty, and what the sobriety? And know we not that, in
dealing with all donkeys, persuasion is better than force?
THE WORKER AND HIS WAGES.
PUNCH has received from Mr. THOMAS McDoRiroND a pamphlet
setting forth the services of the late Lieut. WAGHORN, the origi-
nator and organiser of the Overland Route to India, with the
story of the collapse of its author's attempt, after the Lieutenant's
death, to raise a subscription for the erection of a pillar and bust in
his honour at Alexandria. Only £100 was promised, of which half
has since been repudiated, leaving only £50 available. Punch
would be prompt to take up the case of an enterprising, devoted,
and ill-rewardea public benefactor, if there was the slightest chance
of thereby forwarding the object of Mr. McDoRiroxD. But at least
the hardly-used pioneer has a monument, though to England's
shame it has been raised by M. DE LESSEPS and the Suez Canal
Company, and not by the English Government or the English public.
His daughters have some—though a miserably shabby—acknowledg-
ment of their father's services in the shape of a small pension. But
with one outstanding bill for fireworks to pay, and a larger one
looming in the near future, what chance is there of Government
taking a new and Imperial measure of the hardly-used Lieutenant's
services, had he been ten times the first to prove the navigability of
the Red Sea, so shortening by two months the voyage to India, and
probably in the sharp agony of the Mutiny saving India to the
British Crown.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVAEL
ECHOES FROM THE BACK-STAIRS.
(From Our Man at the Key-hole.}

A'
GOOD story comes to me
from Cyprus. It seems
that as SMITH—whose
yell-known habit of break-
ing out into the hornpipe
whenever he gets a chance
has become of late alrnosl
irrepressible — was going
through some of the figures
on the deck of the Himalaya
off Larnaca the other even-
ing, he happened, in the
haul-over-hand step, which
is new to him, to tread upon
the skylight of the Captain's
cabin. The shower of broken
glass and dust coming rather
smartly down upon STANLEY,
who was idling over his
walnuts with the Officer of
the Watch beneath, the latte:
good-humouredly said,
I'Well, Colonel, SMITH'S
chief has certainly taught
him how to bring down the
dust!"
"Yes," replied STANLEY,
with one of those flashes that
have made him so dreaded
in Pall Mall, "and how to put his foot into it."
Later in the evening this was, by general consent, signalled by
rockets to Sir GARNET, who thought it BO good that he had it
repeated.
**«**•
It seems that the success which has attended the great French
lottery, like that of everything else connected with the Exhibition,
has been entirely due to the tact and goodwill of the Prince. When
the sale of tickets was rather hanging Are, GAMBETTA, who, being
financially interested in the undertaking, was in the habit of walking
about with his pockets crammed with them and forcing them on his
friends, happened to meet the Prince one day at breakfast, at the
Marshal's, where the conversation turned by chance on the approach-
ing departure of the latter for Cowes. "Your Royal Highness had
better take ten thousand of them," said the illustrious Republican,
laughing, and at the same time producing coupons for that number
from a couple of carpet-bags which he held carelessly in his hand.
And then he added, as if struck by a happy after-thought, "Such
an investor ought to score some points, especially as one of the chief
prizes is a ton of pins."
"Pins?" was the ready and royal reply, delivered with admi-
rable bonhomie, "Then I certainly ought to take them, for I am
going straight to the Needles.'" There was a hearty laugh, but the
Prines took the tickets, and the Lottery was made.
SOMETHING LIKE ATHLETICS.
As exercises intended to test human strength and endurance seem
just now to be very popular with the million, Mr. Punch begs to
propose the awarding of prizes for feats other than those associated
with Agricultural Hall pedestrianism; as, for instance:—
First Prize.—Conductor SMITH, of the London General Tramway
Omnibus Company (Limited) for standing on a shelf from eight in
the morning until past twelve at night for weeks and months
together, in winter and summer, in thunder-storms and in snow-falls.
At the same time keeping a record of all his inside and outside pas-
sengers, and receiving and accounting for their various fares. Prize:
five shillings a day.
Second Prize.—Cost«rmonger SNOOKS, for rising with the sun,
purchasing his flat load of vegetables, cheap fruit, or fish in the
early market, and spending the rest of the day and some of the
night in tramping down street after street in the very often vain
effort to sell his load at a few halfpence rise upon the original cost.
Prize: A pound a week for the support of himself, his wife, and
several children.
Third Prize.—Cabman SHOWN, for spending sixteen hours a day
on the hind seat of a hansom, driving a jibbing horse through
crowded thoroughfares often payed with slippery asphalte, and
never free from bad-tempered policemen: p«rforming this feat with
civility, and even cheerfulness, ia spite of the irritation produced by
the receipt of closely-calculated fares as per tariff, and much per-
sonal abuse. Prize: a couple of hasty meals at a shelter, and a few
shillings daily upon which to keep a home.
Fourth Prize.—Boardman CEAWLEY, for tramping the streets in
extreme old age as a " living sandwich;" carrying his boards in the
face of the wind, sleet and snow, amidst the derision of the boys,
the contempt of the public, and the moving on of the Police. Prize:
One Shilling and Sixpence a day, less Contractor's commission.
Grand Extra Prize for Women Only.—ANGELINA BAKER, twenty,
Milliner's attendant, for observing the following regulations in
the establishment to which she belongs:
Not to sit down during the hours of business, generally eight
o'clock in the morning until six, seven, or eight o'clock in the even-
ing except at meal-times. Breakfast from quarter to eight to Quarter
past. To be in the shop as soon as breakfast is finished. Dinner
served in relays from one P.M., when twenty-five minutes will be
allowed, unless business be very brisk, when attendants will be called
up, as wanted. A quarter of an hour at five P.M. for tea. Tore-
main in the shop until parcels for delivery are packed, and goods
cleared away.* Prize : a worn-out frame and shattered constitution.
Extra Prize. — To MAHY DEXTEB, Lodging-house Maid-of-all-
Work, aged seventeen, for the following unequalled feat, kept up
for four months, in a lodging-house near Piccadilly, occupied by
two married couples, a single Lady, their maids, and occasional
visitors. Seven baths filled every morning; two cans of water
carried for each from the basement to the bed-room floors of a four-
storeyed house. Coals supplied to every room. Three sitting-rooms
swept and dusted. Three breakfast-tables laid and cleared after
use. Every bed-room, including the Maids', put in order. Table
laid for lunch and dinner in the evening. Things removed. China
and plate cleaned and replaced. Cubs called. Lodgers sat up for,
till their return from the theatre, or parties. Never in bed before
twelve; seldom before one: and sometimes as late as half-past two.
At her post by six in the morning. Food: scraps from the dishes
and plates of the Lodgers, and their Maids. Potatoes now and then;
and never any other vegetable or pudding. Prize: a bed at the
Hospital, and a parish coffin.

ABOUND the board sitting, in gravity fitting,
They piously say, "Dear freens, let us prey!"
And begin with devotion the work of each day,
O'er forking the shiners to gamblers and miners,
And helping themselves all the time as they may;
And lending and spending, and gold madly sending
To India, Australia, and farther away,
Till the Bank finds itself, like a part of it's pelf,
"In the Province of Poverty Bay."
Denser, intenser the shadows that loom
O'er the faces that sit round that Board in the gloom,
As the Bank rushes on to its moment of doom.
INCUS commingles with caution his cant,
TAYLOH grows paler at every new grant,
WEIGHT for the o'er-righteous finds millions scant,
While the gammon of SALMON, and low knack of STEONACH,
Still deepen the villanous plant!
Yet which of the lot, through the plot, was arch plotter?
Since of STIWABT, his friends and his enemies say,
"He is soft, and was easily moulded, like clay."—'
Yes!" clay in the hand of the Potter."—
Who shall fix which of six, was such master of tricks,
As to chalk out the scheme and begin it?
For six, at the least, of these seven seem in it:
Though some pious brothers slipped out from the others,
And sold off their shares to the minute—
Pawky sons of the Church, when the ship 'gins to lurch,
To lose cash is more easy than win it!
'Twas an infamous slip 'twixt the cup and the lip,
Whether chancing by fluke or by flaw.
That let FLEMING vanish to Spain with the "Spanish,"
And a lot of the loot in his maw,
And leaving behind him no trace how to find him,
But a million of debts, and too scanty assets,
And securities not worth a straw.

Until mjr sole resource
Seems to stand still, by worse than fog confounded,
And with these Imps of Shindydom surrounded.
0-r-r! I hate fog, and I can scarce remember
A denser one than whelms me this November.
The weather has for long been precious hazy,
Unusually so, or else my sight
Is not quite what it was; but this is night,
A prospect dark enough to drive me crazy.
It thickens momently, and what's surprising,
There seems but little promise of its rising.
O'er swamp and stagnant water
A chill North-Easter brought it, and so long
As that wind rules small chance seems there of change.
Steady it blows, and strong,
And sticks and sticks in that confounded quarter
As stubbornly as though the Weathercock
\Vtre nailed N.E., and never more could range.
My hopes they did but mock
Who lately talked of clear and open weather.
Open and clear?
Extremely pleasant words, but much I fear
That I have parted with them altogether.
I used to think I knew my way about,
But now—(Confound those boys! how they do shout!)—
Now I am all abroad. I somehow seem,
As in a nightmare dream,
To miss my ancient way-marks. Am I failing-?
Or have I trusted to new guides o'ermuch?
I feel that I must put it to the touch.
I do like open weather and plain sailing!
Mere noise and flare are not illumination,
fireworks confuse, their blaze is botheration.
A steady Beacon is a thing to trust;
But better far a simple Bull's-eye use,
Than false and flickering flames, which but abuse,
And, in the unwary wanderer's pathway trust,
Like Wrecker's signals, only lure to wreck.
I cannot follow every link-boy's beck.
This way .' This way! This way.'
Well, I dare say
Some of the shouting lot, at least, mean well;
But which to follow how am I to tell?
Will-o'-the-Wisp is a misleading elf
That often lands the traveller in a bog.
I must strike light, I fancy, for myself,
Ere I shall find my way out of this fog.
Great Civic Retrenchment.
THE Corporation has been in the habit of looking to its intrench-
ments. It has at last, we are glad to hear, turned its attention to
retrenchment.
1. The Men in Brass are put down. 2. The Badges of the Dinner
Committee have been done away with. 3. The Lord Mayor's Foot-
men are to be reduced from six to five.

A RUN WITH OLD BUCKS.
By a Veracious Veteran—a Fine Old Englishman, one of the
Olden Time.

[You are quite right^ Sir. Neither do I see why the Daily Tele-
graph should have all the sporting to itself. Acting on your hint—
rent", vidi, vici—and, as the Detective said, when he caught a fellow
watching the private gallops of the Derby Crack, " Voila Tour!"
Yours, THB 0tD .TTJJ AT n AGAIN.]
Mount Street,
THB morn was bright, crisp, and cheery as I slapped iny buck-
skins, and saluting right and left, rode up the hifl to the Meet,
determined to do or die, as I have do'd and die'd any time this last
forty years past. Companions of my youth, where are ye? But no
matter. Here J am, at all events, the same gallant clinker across
country that I was of yore, with as mettlesome a bit of stuff under me
as ever answered merrily to whip and spur, or came a light-hearted
cropper at the first fence. Yoicks! my boys!
A better meet than Cos Hill there isn't in the whole county.
Everyone knows it. It is visible from the rise of its twin brother,
Box Kill, and is scarcely a couple of miles canter from KNOX'S farm
—KNOX who married PENELOPE ANNE, I mean, originally widow of
WILLIAM WIQSINS, proprietor of bathmg-maehines at Margate and
Ramsgate, and to whose stables, when the bathing season is over, I
invariably go for my ready-made hunter, to do all my winter work
•—seven—I mean six days a week at the least.
But the show, first-rate though it be, and not a finer one for men
and mounts in all England, is yet not what it was (with, of course,
one exception) in my day.
Ah! ho\v well I remember ALFRED COUNT D'OaSAT as he dashed
up in his curricle and two grooms, with the lovely Lady CUSSINGTON
beside him. How he would jump out, seize me by the hand, and
exclaim, "BOUNCES, man ami, comment qa va?" To which I would
reply. "ALFREDO mio! ya va tres bien chez moi. Et vous, man
cher T"
Had I at that time possessed the advantages of Briareus, I couldn't
have gratified all the shaking required at my hands. There they
were, Princes, Peers, Judges, Bigwigs, Peeresses, Duchesses, rich
Commoners, and all the reigning beauties sparkling in the early
morn, coming up and crying out, "BOUNCEB, my buck, how goes
It t
And then old General TOPLOFTY, riding up on a little towel-horse,
of the rough-and-ready sort, at the last moment, and calling out, in
stentorian tones, " BOUNCER, you"—the General was notedior his
warmhearted expletives, for which, in this rose-water age, I substi-
tute reversible equivalents—" BOUNCES, you blooming gentlemanly
party, why the neaven don't you move your flowering beautiful
young person out of the blessed road, and be beatified to you!"
Dear old General, how fond he was of me, and I of him!
"BOUNCES." he 'd say to me, often and often, "of all the blooming
clever people I know, you are the bloomingest clever person I ever set
eyes on!
Well, well, the Recording Angel must have had a. hard time of it
•while the General was alive. But this is talking of the past and
gone, and here we are in the present. Yoicks! Tally-ho!
Fresh from Devonshire, on my own pure cream (as fine a mare as
ever trod the sands at Dawlish—I didn't get her at. KNOX'S for
once), whose outside price was sixty sovs., but whose inside price,
when the blinds are pulled down, is known only to his owner—thus
mounted, I say, I was the cynosure of all eyes. They would never
have gone away had I not exclaimed, "Gentle-men, Gentlemen,
what are you staring at? Ain't we here to catch a fox, or a stag,
or something, and not to be standing staring all day at the Real Fine
Old English Gentleman? Eh?"
"Now, my lads!"
It was an animated scene. There were three'Dukes in white hats
and Royal Liveries, twenty Earls with their sporting coronets
jauntily set sideways, a few Viscounts, two Judges (supposed to be
on Circuit), a fair sprinkling of Queen's Counsel with their best
sporting wigs on, and their brief-bags (containing luncheon) hanging
from the saddle, several unknown people in pink tops and caps, and.
finally, of course, the usual comic countryman on a donkey, followed
by the Parish Beadle in full fig, and the laughing crowd.
Through my exertions the Reporters for the Press had a table to
themselves; and a Gentleman from the Daily Telegraph, who had
got himself up for the part, in pink, brass buttons, yellow cords,
gamboge tops, white hat, and bird's-eye scarf, I accommodated
with a seat on my own saddle, courteously dismounting, with the
true gallantry of the old school (of which I was Captain), and doing
all in my power with the stirrups to make him comfortable.
He looked as fit as a fiddle, but he repaid my kindness basely—
double-basely.
No sooner was the fox uncarted (or stag, for I couldn't see which
it was, and the people about were uncertain), than with a " Whoop!
Tally-ho! Yoicks!" and a flick of his hunting-whip that whisked
off my hat, and caught me a nasty one in the eye, the Daily Tale-
graph man was off—-I mean, I was off, and he was on my horse—and
away! away! o'er the mountain's brow!
"Hullo! Stop him!" I cried, as I saw him bucketting away
over the ploughed field, whooping, yelling, spurring, and whipping
like n maniac.
My Devon cream was thoroughly whipped by the time they came
back—dead beat, and not worth sixpence an hour to the merest
invalid in a bath-chair. They had a splendid run for their money,
and so had I. We were "away" for an hour and forty minutes
—1 taking all the short cuts I could think of, and catching sight of
them now and then, or hearing the distant horn at rare intervals.
On their return to KNOX'S Farm, the Gentleman of the Daily
Tvlt'flraph (at least so he gave me to understand) apologised sin-
cerely, explained that he had been run away with, that he couldn't
stop my horse; and when I ventured to observe, that, as he had had
all the fun, I thought that he ought to pay for it, he turned on me
quite savagely, and wanted to know what I meant by putting
him on a brute beast that had almost broken his neck, and that
might have brought ruin and misery to the orphan and widow. I was
nonplussed. I accepted the position, and went home thoughtfully.
Two days after, I did see an account in the D. T. of a day with
Her Majesty's Buckhounds, and I fancy I recognised much that I
had let fall in the course of conversation about the glories of the
past, anecdotes of D'ORSAr, and so forth. This may be mere coinci-
dence; but I shall certainly call on the worthy proprietors of that
journal, or the worthy Editor, and ask to see the photograph of their
Sporting Correspondent who signs himself "A VETERAN "—when
perhaps he means a Veterinary—and who is an Old Soldier (if he's
the man I met) if ever there was one, and knows his way about—
rather!
I may be mistaken; but still I send yon this to show you how I
did go, and how it was, through no fault of mine, that I missed the
first run that the Old Bucks have had for some years.
Sky-flying—Captive and Loose.
Sy a Hostile Party.
(On M. GAMBETTA'S late ascent in the " Captive Balloon")
THOUGH he can't shoot the moon,
In a Captive Balloon,
Red Republican gas is the force of it;

A TTENDANT WANTED, for an occasional Invalid Gentleman who
A. will act m Cook in a small family. Wages, £18. Aged 35 to 4fi. No

DOES this mean that the occasional invalid Gentleman will act as
Cook in a small family? If so, no wonder he is occasionally invalided,
and that the rest of the family should find it necessary to hire an
attendant to restrain him.
In answer to this wonderfully lucid advertisement, from the Daily
Telegraph, one need hardly be told " No Irish need apply." There
must, one would think, be quite enough of the Irish element in the
family already.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A CAUTION.
No WONDER Miss LAVINIA STITCHWORT THOUGHT THE PEOPLE VERY RUDE AT THE STATION WHEN SHE WENT FOK HER "WATER-
PROOF" (WHICH SHE HAD LOST ON THE RAILWAY SOME TlME BEFORE). SHE FOUND OUT WHEN SHE GOT HOME SHE HAD NOT REMOVED
THE LABEL!
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
A Visit to a Musical Festival, and a few words about Theatrical
Matters.
SIR,
I WOULDN'T have missed Mr. SAMUEL HAYES' Festival (or
the Festival of SAMUEL HAYES) for a considerable sum. To have
heard SIMS REF.VKS sing " The Bay of Biscay O " was worth, well
worth, dining earlier than six-thirty,-—was well worth coming even
an unreasonable distance. And people did come an unreasonable
distance, I '11 be sworn, on that occasion, and were marvellously
unreasonable in consequence, for they would have had Mr. SIMS
REEVES encored and encored again, and then wouldn't have been
satisfied. Mr. SIMS REEVES gave in, once, to their enthusiasm, and
gave in graciously, shaking his head, however, as he skipped up the
steps and bounded on to the platform, as much as to say, "This is
too bad of you—I mean too good of you, Ladies and Gentlemen—but
as this is my first appearance at what is called a Promenade Concert,
why I will accept the encore, or as the Chairmen of the Music-Hails
have it, "Mr. SIMS REEVES will oblige again."
But this was not to " The Bay of Biscay O " no. This was to
MENDELSSDON'S recitative and air 'r If with all your hearts."
Madame ANTOINETTE STERLING is a great favourite, and, being
encored in " The Song of the Shirt," sang "Pulley Hatiley," and,
of course, sang it admirably.
There can be no objection to encores being taken as a demand from
the audience for an entirely new song, if it be so stipulated in the
bond. But, if I am so pleased with Madame's, or Mister's, rendering
of a particular song that I cry out " Encore " or " Bis," meaning,
in plain English, "Again! again!" surely Madame, or Mister, ought
to repeat that identical song, or else my "encore" or "bis must
seem to imply that " I am very pleased, it is true, with the song
you 've sung, Madame or Mister, out I am sure you can do better it
you only try; so please give ut another, and something totally
different too."
Consequently, my "encore " is only a qualified compliment.
But "they all do it," except Mr. SIMS REEVES, who, I had always
heard, steadfastly set his face against the encore system. He is only
partly right. A delighted audience pays a singer a compliment in
re-demanding a song. A nattered singer should take the compli-
ment as intended, and, )/ I'M his power, without fatiguing himself
and so detracting subsequently from the pleasure of his audience,
he ought to " oblige again." The engagement to sing includes the
probability of an encore, and an encore is the pleasing penalty of
well-deserved popularity. To sins nn entirely different song, by way
of accepting an encore, is a mistake in toto.
Talking of in toto reminds me that there was another case in Tito
—1 mean in Tito Mattei. Signor TITO MATTEI played admirably
his "Souvenir d'ltalie" and his " Valse de Concert." Result an
enthusiastic encore. What does TITO do? He plays " Home, sweet
Home" with variations. Signor TITO, however, must be credited
with something of satire in his selection, as " Home, sweet Home"
becomes rather monotonous, even to the most domesticated, without
variations of some sort.
The excellent Signor was immensely applauded by the audience,
and, above all, by the members of the Orchestra, who shook hands
with him as if he were going away on a long journey, one energetic
gentleman, attached, I think, to a second violin, actually slapping
nirn on the back, as much as to say, "Bravo, Trrus! "iou're the
sort of chap I like—you are! Bravo! I backed you to win, and
you 've done it, TITUS, my boy!"
Then there was a merry Zingara (Mdlle. MATHILDE ZIMERI), who
ought to have appealed half-an-hour before, but had probably been
detained by being out gipsying, and having some distance to come.
She sang " Tra la la " as a merry Zingara invariably will, and told
us how ner "passport was a light guitar," which would of course
have to be carefully examined at the Custom-House—and this might
have caused her some extra delay.
M. RIVIERE'S orchestra performed in first-rate style LTJMBYE'S
spirited "Summer Day in Norway," a descriptive fantasia, and so
brought the first part to a brilliant conclusion.
But, mind you, this "Promenade Concert" was not a promenade
concert at all. Every one was seated; and the dis-concerted look of

the few swells of the present "Toothpick and Crutch" school, who strolled in, about ten,
for a lounge, was most amusing to behold.
The absence of the popping of soda-water bottles, and of the jingling accompaniment
of anything but musical glasses, was a great boon. I heard only two pops the whole
evening; and as this was not one of the Monday Pops," it was a custom more honoured
in the oreach than the observance — for imagine Mr. SIMS REEVES being interrupted in the
middle of his great " Bay of Biscay, O!" song, when everyone is literally hanging on his
lips, by the sudden pop of some buoyant cork!
There was another capital selection for the Orchestra in SUPPE'S "Poet and Peasant
Overture"— a. title that reminds me of a certain Cartoon, in this periodical, where Lord
BEACONSFIELD is envying the lot of the happy Woodcutter— the People's WILLIAM— in his
rural retirement.
Then the next feature of the Festival was Madame LEMMENS-SHEHHINGTON'S "By the
Margin of fair Zurich's Waters ;" and then — expectation was a-tiptoe, and a psrceptible
thrill ran through the audience, as the gallant young English Tenor — the jolly Tar in all
but the costume — came aboard, and piped all hands to listen to his " Bay of Biscay, Ol"
Everyone who knows anything at all of the Tar-Tenor, knows how he, and he alone,
can sing this, so to speak, plain-sailing song. From first to last, artistic au bout des
angles. I defy anyone — except he absolutely detest the sea and the slightest motion of the
smallest boat— not to go with the singer through that fearful night of shipwreck, and be
scarcely able to resist joining in the "three cheers" with which the vocalist greets the
opportune arrival of a Sail! a Sail!!
All I want to know, without being hypercritical, is, who is supposed to sing this song;
a professional sailor or an ordinary passenger? If an Old Salt — then Mr. SIMS REEVES'S
reading is faultless, but the ballad itself is not what a tar would have written. If the
narrator is an inexperienced passenger, then the ballad is faultless, and Mr. SIMS REEVES is
wrong in his interpretation.
I have not time to go thoroughly into this nice question, which I recommend to the study
of the singer and the public; only a suggestion arises out of this, and that is, let Mr. SIMS
REEVES first sin^ it as the tar, and when encored, as encored he cannot fail to be, let him give
a new reading ot it as a passenger who suffers from sea-sickness. This will touch heart-
home the majority of his audience. Indeed a new edition, or encore edition, might be written
on these lines :—
We made but one remark —
"Oh, this is not a lark!"
For the day we must pay
In the Bay of Biscay 0!
And a very little humouring on the part of the singer would express exactly the impecunious
state of the parties, who had just got the money for a two hours' sail, but hadn't enough to
satisfy the boatman for a whole day out; thus —
Loud roared the dreadful thunder,
The rain a deluge show'rs;
We felt we 'd made a blunder
To take our boat two hours.
Let's in the Bay of Biscay owe!
And this I present, with my compliments, to Mr. SIMS REEVES, when next he sings this
song—when may I be there to hear—and to Mr. SAMUEL HAYES for another Festival.
But I hope to hear more of our gallant
young English Tenor, before long, in Tom
Tuff, and also as Captain Macheath in the
Beggar's Opera. It used to be "Bravo,
HICKS!" That is past and gone. Let us
substitute "Bravo, HAYES !" if he is going
to (rive us that treat.
Mr. CHATTERTON is showing us what can
be done with SHAKSPEARE at Drury Lane,
and Mr. DILLON and Mrs. VEzm have any-
thing but an idle time of it just now.
Poor dear old PHELPS ! the last of the Old
School has gone, and with him Sir Pertinax
Macsycophant.
A word, by the way, for the dear old
Polytechnic—" clarum etvenerabilenomen"
—though it wasn't by any means a case of no
men the night I visited it, but of a good
many men, and still more women and chil-
dren. They are having great doings there
just now.
First, they give you " Food, and its Pre-
paration," by PEPPER — the right condi-
ment in the right place—and then you are
introduced to " Cabul and the Afghans,"
by Mr. T. L. KINO—" Scenery, People,
Manners, and Customs"—for our guidance
in these anxious times, when every day
brings its letters in each other's teeth, for
and against going in at the Ameer.
And then the visitor is pitilessly taken all
about the Paris Exhibition—twenty miles of
it, at least—by judicious short cuts, and then
trotted off to China—and then into fairy-
land, to be introduced to the " Cinderella of
1878," who is called—I can't conceive why—
Zitella, through a series of tableaux, on the
disc and on the stage, with musical and pic-
torial accompaniments written by a gentle-
man of the excruciatingly funny name of
TIFKINS THUDD! If the patter could be cut
a little shorter it would be so much the
sweeter. And all this besides the old stand-
ing attractions, the Diving-Bell, and the
Machinery, and the Cosmorama, and the
Electric Cascade, and all the Arts and
Sciences know what besides. It is the
fullest bill in London.
Mr. CLARKE with The Rivals is doing
capitally at the Haymarket, and I hope he
will go on with the Old Comedies as long
as he can cast them as well as he has cast
this masterpiece of SHERIDAN'S. What
a good play it is, barring always Falkland
and Julia, and what a model from begrn-
ning to end. Yet I suppose modern Cntios
would call the plot "slight "—if the play
were modern. But surely the plot of a
genuine Comedy should be "slight"—and
the greatest events from the most trifling
causes should spring—telle est la vie—and
Comedy is Life, or Life is Comedy, at least,
in the opinion of the laughing Philosopher
who signs himself

it would almost
seem as if King Carnival had usurped one night's sway in this
normally quiet—not to say stupid—Sussex borough. Brass bands,
heading a procession of cresset-bearers many hundreds strong;
banner-men and maskers; a Commander-in-Chief, with his staff—
not a constable's, we need hardly say—and a Lord Bishop, escorted
by a strong force of mock clergy; colossal bonfires and blazing
tar-barrels scattered about the thoroughfares crowded with mas-
queraders of both sexes; fireworks in full blast all over the town •
shop-fronts and lower storey windows barricaded; cart-loads of
combustibles piled and fired within a few feet of the Town Hall;
and a brace of colossal Guys, to be duly paraded first and blown up
afterwards, all help to make night hideous, to frighten timid house-
holders out of their wits, to keep the fire-brigade on the alert, and
reduce the police force to insignificance for one night of the three
hundred and sixty-five.
"It is a poor heart that never rejoices;" and Lewes takes its
rejoicing as the county capital of " Silly Sussex " might be expected
to do.
It is really refreshing to know that there remains in the United
Kingdom one town at least in which the good old times of merry
England are renewed, -with their horse-play, row, and riot, if
only for one night in the year. And as they say no houses are
burnt down, and no more heads broken or pockets picked than
the normal allowance among quieter crowds, why should not Lewes
enjoy its Fifth of November revel till its inhabitants wake sadder
and wiser men, not only "the morrow morn,"—like the ancient
mariner,—but all the year round?

"THE WORKING OF THE WIRES;" OR, UNDER
THE CAUCUSES.
(A Chapter from a Historical Romance of ttte Future.)
CHAPTER XXIX.— Vee Victis!
BKUTUS JONES, the Modern CROMWELL, as he was called by his
trembling admirers—the Nineteenth Century ROBESPIEKKE, as he
was denounced (in whispers) by his embittered but impotent foes-
sat alone in his sanctum. In spite of his victory, there was a frown
upon his brow telling of remorse. His success had been complete.
The result of the Municipal Elections had given him unlimited
power. The "Hundreds,'^ and the "Four," "Six," and "Twelve
Hundreds," who hailed him as their chosen Wire-puller, had done
his bidding to the letter. Everywhere his party was in the ascen-
dant; everywhere the other party was cast down, demolished,
grovelling in the dust. And yet BRUTDS JONES was not happy.
He fell asleep; and in his dreams he strove in vain with the
Nemesis of his own overthrow. He imagined that the wheel of
fortune had revolved, and that the other party had taken the place
now occupied by his own. He woke with a start, and, murmuring,
"I must reassure myself," touched the bell with which lie was
wont to summon his Secretary. That faithful follower appeared.
"Ah! SMITH," he exclaimed. "I see you have not left me. My
word still is law, eh?"
The Secretary raised his eyebrows in astonishment, and bowed.
"Let me know at once," continued the Chairman of the "Hun-
dreds," bent on testing the reality of his nightmare, "which of my
orders have been carried out?"
"Nearly all, I think, Sir," returned the Secretary, glancing at a
list. "The places of the Directors of the Bank of England, left
vacant by the abrupt dismissal of the leading merchants and bankers
of the other party, have been filled by trusty nominees of our own.
It i'» true, that the new men as yet know little or nothing about the
law of finance or banking, but their political principles are unim-
peachable."
'80 far, well!" murmured BRUTUS; "go on!'
"We have changed the entire Bench of Middlesex Magistrates.
The new Justices have reversed all the decisions of their pre-
decessors. Thev have restored licences to"
"Of course: I know," impatiently interrupted the great Wire-
puller. "A party must sacrifice something to its principles. I
nope the officials of all our gaols are changed f"
Much to the disgust of the prisoners of the other party, who
have lost all their good marks in consequence. The Hangman, too,
pretends that ho has a vested right in his appointment," replied the
Secretary.
'' And our Hospital Staffs? Have they felt the influence of our
victory?"
'They have, Sir." returned the Secretary, with a sigh: he had a
kindly heart. "The patients complain that the new Surgeons are
not so skilful as the old ones. An amputation now takes fifteen
minutes against five under the old rfgime"
'' What if it took an hour?" cried the modern CBOMWKLL, angrily.
"A good citizen surely should be prepared to endure a few minutes'
pain for his country's good! What more?"
"The Schoolmasters appointed by the old School Boards have been
dismissed, or appointed to worse paid posts."
"Ah! those old Schoolmasters have much to learn. The sooner
they take their lesson to heart, the better," said the Chairman, with
a bitter laugh. "What next?"
"\Ve have deprived all the Beadles of their posts. They clung
to their uniforms; but now their gold-laced coats clothe limbs of
purer political tvpe, their cocked hats cover heads of more advanced
Liberal inspiration. If Bumbledom is not sound in political opinions,
what can be expected of BULL?"
"And the Police?"
"Judiciously handled, and now officered by men of the right
sort, they may be said to be with us to a man. The Volunteers, too,
have threatened to resign in a body, unless their officers give place
to citizen Soldiers of our colour. In a fortnight the Gazette will con-
tain the names of Colonels, Majors, Captains, and Subalterns, all as
sound in opinion as St. Paul's bells, if a little shaky in their drill
and the duties of their respective commands."
"One can't have everything in this world," returned the Chairman.
"Have the crossing-sweepers been changed, and the cabmen been
warned that their licences are forfeited, except on condition of ad-
herence to our platform? Have the retrograde apple-women of
the hostile party been informed that they must give up the sites of
their stalls to those who go for Progress and the People r'
"Certainly, Sir," replied the Secretary. And again he sighed
heavily.
"An!—apropos. Have the attendants at Han well and Colney

They are good and worthy men, and their duties are difficult, and

of them?"
The Great Wire-puller turned on him an eye of stern, but cold,
reproof. "If their successors know their duty, they will shut them
up for being mad enough to disagree with MS. And now begone!
I would be alone."
As the Secretary retired, his Chief muttered between his teeth,
"Why does he prate to me of goodness and worthiness? What
have these virtues to do with politics?"
And leaving this conundrum unanswered, the Chairman of the
Hundreds turned once more to the complex ramifications and reticu-
lations of his wires.

A COINAGE FOR CYPRUS.
DEAR MK. PUNCH,
I THINK you and your readers -will agree with
me that as our last acquisition is absorbing, and likely
to absorb, a great deal too much of our money, the
sooner we can give it money of its own the better. In
fact, a coinage for Cyprus is, or ought to be, in the
Mint, or on its way to the die, like its unfortunate gar-
rison. Why should this new mintage not be made at
once to indicate our acquisition of the island, to pay a
compliment to its acquirers, and to stereotype one of the
most ingenious of recent legends? The two former ends
may be secured in the devices of the coin; the other in
its inscription.
If Lord BEACONSFIELD and Mr. FREMANTLE take my
advice, this new money will not be a mere coinage of the
brain, but a copy of the old coin of the island, which
bore on the obverse a Bull, on the reverse a Dove. Can
anvthing be more appropriate at once to the situation,
and the ready-made legend, "Peace with Honour"—
Dove to symbolise the one, Bull the other?
There! As the Roman proverb used to run—
"Rcm ex nsse cognosces."
Yours,

THE Rule of the Road's clear as light—
That in driving a carriage along,
The man who drives left is all right,
And the man who drives right is all wrong.

And witnesses get by the ears,
To be simply, "There's no Rule at all."
Eminently Appropriate.
Ix an article in this month's Fortnighth/ Rei-ieic, Mr.
A. II. WALLACE proposes to naturalise in Epping Forest
"the remarkable Salisburia or Gingko Tree. Have we
not here a scientific appellation for the Salisbury or Jingo
Tree, which might certainly be selected with peculiar
appropriateness as the Conservative "plant" of the day?
"CHEAPER AND CHEAPER STILL."
IT is rumoured that the present Lord Mayor is determined to
temper Civic hospitality and municipal ceremonial with what the
City has till now but too little regarded—economy. Should the report
be correct, and the fashion of retrenchment find favour in the eyes
of the Citizens, Mr. Punch, pleases himself in imagining a Ninth
of November of the future, something after this fashion—
THE PROCESSION.
The day was a glorious one, and every inch of Fleet Street, the
Strand, and Charing Cross was crowded. A 'single detachment of
dismounted Police led the way. These Guardians of the Peace were
succeeded by a drag, kindly lent by Messrs. BUXTON & Co. the
eminent brewers, carrying in a bundle all the flags and banners of
the Corporation. An array of Charity Children in their quaint
garb of the olden time, arranged according to the colour of their
caps and gowns—a girl and boy together—brought up the rear. The
Charwoman of the Mansion House with her insignia of office, the
time-hallowed broom and duster, borne by an Under-cleaner, was
the next to put in an appearance. Then came the feature of the
show, a musician playing no less than six different instruments at
once. The applause of the mob was almost deafening, as this
cheap, compact, and compendious substitute for the old-fashioned
military bands went merrily and musically by. The Recorder in his
wig was next seen picking his way modestly through the mud. The
City Marshal riding a bicycle followed. Then came two Atlas
omnibuses, hired by the hour, filled inside and out with Aldermen
who had, and who had not, passed the Chair. At last the LORD
MAYOR'S coach approached, ana it was not difficult to understand
that a great saving in expense had been effected by discarding the
horses of other days for the Ludgate Hill street-traction-engine.
After his Lordship had passed, a Sergeant's Guard of the Victoria
llines, in undress uniform, brought the procession to a brilliant
and not expensive termination.
THE BANQUET.
The usual company (including Her Majesty's Ministers, Ambassa-
dors, and a limited selection of the Corporation, made by ballot)
assembled to do honour to the LORD MAYOR at the Guildhall.
At the high table the famous three-and-sixpenny dinner from the
Holborn Restaurant was served in first-rate style, and every other
guest found a bottle of Bass before him. The less important feasters
at the other tables were supplied with hot water, bread-and-butter,
and shrimps at the trifling cost of sixpence a head, it being under-
stood that they were to bring their own tea with them. An excellent
band, consisting of a violin and harp which had been playing in
front of an adjacent tavern until the hour fixed for the banquet,
were accommodated with seats in the Music Gallery.
Later on, the harmony of the evening was enhanced by the per-
formance of an Italian musician (whose name we failed to catch),
who executed several brilliant fantasias on the barrel-organ.
When the cloth had been removed, and the loving-cup (tilled with
shandy-gaff) had been passed round, the usual loyal toasts were
proposed at the usual length, and received with the wonted
cordiality.
Rather later than usual, after the PREMIER, in returning thanks
for his own health, had commenced a political speech of unusual
interest, the LORD MAYOR said he regretted to interrupt the harmony
of the evening, but he had to state that, in order to save expense, the
Lighting Committee had arranged to turn off the electric light at
ten, so that he feared the audience must be content with such en-
lightenment as they could derive from his noble friend's oratory;
and the company separated in much disorder, after listening to the
Noble Lord with some impatience for a considerable time, on finding
that he was unlikely to throw any light on the situation.

perhaps by this means impart some additional life to nis own pulsa-
tion. Hiding his light under a bushel, as it were.
He regards me with pity, and evidently wonders what on earth
can have induced me to get out at Bursted Mills.
The train for Clogsole and Clayborq' is waiting, and there are two
other ghosts besides myself going by it.
We get into our compartments silently, avoiding one another. The
train starts noiselessly. No bustle, no screaming, no life. The wheels
are muffled, and the rails have been oiled by the greasy fog, for we
glide along into a deeper and deeper gloom, and the curtains of mist
close around us and behind us, deadening all sound, and gradually
shutting us out from the outer world.
I am wondering what evil genius prompted me to accept JOSSLYN
DYKE'S invitation to his country-house at this time of year! But
'tis done! May I arrive safely!
We stop at Clogsole. Somebody gets out. I arrive at the fact by
listening attentively. I can just see a shadowy figure—a melancholy
shade. It becomes merged in the fog, like the shadow that used to
stand behind the Haunted Man's chair in the Adelphi drama,—and j
then he disappears,—perhaps burked on the spot, robbed, and rolled
over into a muddy ditch outside Clogsole Station—to be left till
called for. And when will he be called for? Alas! poor ghost!
In the old days of murderous romances and thrilling melodramas,
it usedto be the innkeeper, or the miller, who gave his victims shelter
for the night, when their fate was sealed. In these days of steam-
travelling, can it be that the civil station-master has taken the
place of the black-browed host of the Roadside Inn, or of Orindoff
the miller?
Clayboro' Station. I dread getting out. I look cautiously round.
I descend. No porter. Nobody. I hear a voice, somewhere in the
night air, sighing out sadly." Clayboro "—that is all.
My luggage—that is, my Wonderful Bag is with me. The phantom
train glides away, and vanishes in a flash of fire: then all is dark-
ness on the Line. I am alone, with my bag, on the platform. At last
a glowworm porter advances to take my ticket. I tell him I am
bound for Mr. JOSSLYN DYKE'S, The Mote, Moss End. By an effort
of memory, as though unaccustomed to conversation, he recalls, after
some hesitation, the name of the house and its owner. I fancy he
regards me suspiciously, as though I might be a detective in disguise,
and JOSSLYN ot The Mote a coiner.
I am inclined to re-assure him by protesting I mean no harm to
JOSSLYN DYKE, that I am his warmest friend, that is, if in these
parts there can be such a thing as a warm friend, unless he go
about in bearskins three deep, with coals of fire heaped on his head
like the itinerant roast chestnut vendors in the London streets—
which has always struck me as a wonderful invention for keeping
one's head warm.
[Happy Thought.—We have feet-warmers, why not "head-
warmers?" Strange that this fashion in our climate should not be
more generally adopted. No need to sell chestnuts; merely a hat-
full of coals, lighted by the servant when you go out. The "New
patent iron hat for keeping the head warm in winter,"—is a
brilliant idea. Might write, on this subject top, to Mr. EDISON.
He 'd work it up into something. Only I register it first. The
New Patent Coalhole Hat, invaluable for lightness and warmth.
No brushing required.]
Fortunately there is a fly. This is a rare bit of luck. JOSSLYN
DYKE hadn't sent it. It has come to take somebody else somewhere
else, and the somebody else's heart has evidently failed him at the
last minute, as he hasn't arrived, and can't now for another two
hours. With my bag I take my seat in the fly, and cheer up a
bit. No matter to me, now, that the fly has a nasty odour of damp
hay—no matter to me that the doors are warped and close with
difficulty—no matter that one window won't come up and the other
won't go down, and that it rattles, and shakes, and wobbles. These
are no discomforts to me now, for I am spared a dirty walk, and

saved, perhaps, from losing myself, and losing; everything else, it
might be, bag included, on the lonely road between the station and
The Mote.
I can see nothing of the country, and very little of the village. It
is a village. I can make out the straggling, dimly-lighted shops of
the general-dealers, and we nearly bump up against some waggons
standing out in the road in front of the old village inn. There is
some shouting, not much, and some bad language—the latter stronger
than the shouting, and more of it,—and we continue our route.

Faint, flickering, bilious-looking lamps, at intervals, the posts
being invisible. The trap takes a turn to the left, then another to
the right, then to the left again: and then I couldn't swear whether
it is turning right or left, or whether we are curving round and
round, and travelling in a circle. All I am sure of is, that we are
not going straight; and at times I could almost positively swear
that we are going backwards. Wherever The Mote may ultimately
be, the road to it seems to be through a labyrinth of lanes; and, to
judge by the jolting, we are passing over deep ruts, or old water-
courses.
At last we pull up. I can see absolutely nothing. Can I have
arrived at Nowhere, the country residence of Mr. Nobody 'f I know
that in crowded London, JOSSLYN DYKE would probably be Nobody;
but here in the country I thought he would be Somebody. Nobodies
in London, are, more often than not, Somebodies in the country.
The Flyman has descended, and, as far as I can make out, is
trying to climb up a pole. Good Heavens! is this the way into
JOSSLYN DYKE'S house?
No; he isn't trying to climb: he is only fumbling about a door-
post to find a bell.
Becoming accustomed to the darkness, I see that we are close up
against a high, and, as it seems to me, black wall.
[Happy Thought. Good omen. Arriving at Blackwall. Used not
BlackwaQ to be famous for its dinners ?]
We are between two black walls, and under heavy, over-hanging
branches. A large, massive gateway looms gradually out from the
wall, slowly taking form, shape, and colour, like a change in a
lissolvmg view. Then, too, I become aware of a house, at some
little distance oft—an old gabled house—and, as I think, a tower.
The Flyman has discovered the bell-chain by the mere accident of
the iron handle hitting him on the nose, which makes him, not un-
naturally, angry, but sets him to pulling at it with the vigour of an
irritable person suffering under a sense of injury, and determined to
"let 'em nave it" whoever they are.
But it takes three pulls to produce one sound.
[Happy Thought. Idea for a " Sound Table."—with my compli-
ments to the "Ancient Society of College Youths," or whatever the
scientific bell-ringers call themselves,—on the plan of any other table
of weights and measures. And why not? There is such a thing as
"a measured tone," and how will the ordinary dealer measure it, if
not by rule, i.e., by table. I don't see my way to the proportions
except starting with—
Three pulls (at u bell).... make .... One sound.
Two sounds , .... Somebody hear.
Somebody hearing makes.... No difference.
No difference One angry.]
But these are details merely suggested at JOSSI.YN DYKE'S door,
by the fact of the Flyman having rung several solemn knells—and
the bell only knells once solemnly to every three good hard pulls
—without any result. It really appears as if the people within, on
hearing the knell, had gone quietly off and buried themselves. I
have often heard of persons "burying themselves in the country,"
but never knew it was done in this way before.
I mention this jestingly to the Flyman, who doesn't understand the
humour of the thing, and is inclined to fancy I am chaffing him.
However, as he has his fare in view, and an extra sixpence for bell-
ringing, he does not retort on me; but he is doing anything but
"blessing the bell" at that moment.
Lights t The sounds of life! Bolts, locks, and bars are flying
asunder! Chains rattle as though a hundred persons were being let
loose out of the Bastille. More bolts, locks, and bars. More chains.
Then the deep baying of a hound from somewhere. Where? It
occurs to me that if this basso-profondo hound is the watch-do^, he
must be rather useless, seeing that he took no notice of our arrival,
and had to be roused by the bell before he uttered a sound.
However, that's DYKE'S affair, not mine; all that concerns me
about the hound with the bass growl just now is—where is he <it this
minute? I can't see him; and 1 hate to hear an invisible dog.
The outer portal—it is a portal—opens,—of its own accord.
Through it, I see a line of light leading to a doorway, where stands
a tall figure, holding a lantern, and peering out cautiously. Then
the tall figure advances, gravely.
Associating his appearance—he is in black, and a stiff white tie—
with the funereal knell that has just sounded, I cannot help looking
upon him as an undertaker attached to the establishment. He
advances upon me, holding his lantern aloft, as though he were
searching for a body—as an undertaker might be expected to do if
he had lost one in the snow; and then for the first time I perceive
behind him a huge St. Bernard mastiff. This completes the picture
of finding the body in the snow (only there's no snow, but plenty of
glistening idead leaves), and he ceases to represent an undertaker,
but a monk of St. Bernard turned Protestant, and dressed as a
clergyman of the Evangelical school. It is JOSSLYN DYKE'S butler:
and—thank Heaven!—this is JOSSLYN DYKB'S!
Joyfully I bestow largesse on the Flying Bellringer—I mean the
Bellringing Flyman; and, after making friends with the dog, who
sniffs about me to assure himself of my heing the sort of person he
would recommend his master to admit, I surrender my bag—my bag
af bags—to the care of the butler, and, without another word from
tlim to me, or from me to him—it is all done silently, in dumb show,
like a ballet in plain clothes—and there is an air of mystery about,
as if I were the last conspirator to arrive, and had kept the others
waiting—I follow the butler and the bag into the Hall.
[Happy Thought (title for song)—The Butler and the Bag.]
In another second there is a pattering of feet on the dark oak
oorj and two dogs suddenly appear, stop short, and glower at me
suspiciously. They are weird-looking creatures, both of them. The
irst, a trifle in advance of the other, has a large goblinesqne head
with great goggly eyes, awkward overgrown legs, long tawny body,
md a tail that writhes and twists like an eel. Were I asked, at
laphazard, to fix his breed, I should say something between a bull-
dog, a pug, and a grotesque Chinese ornament, the last factor in his
composition predominating. The other dog is. as far as I can make
out, white, f Inn, and long pointed at both ends like a double pencil.
[t is an unsubstantial dog, and strikes me as a phantom animal: the
irst is a fiend. They do not utter a sound or move. On my left
itands the austere Butler and the St. Bernard. None of us move or
utter a sound. It is a tableau. Enter npon this picture, my friend
FOSSLYN DYKE who steps forward, greeting me cordially but
solemnly.
"Dinner," he says, gravely, "will.be ready in half an hour. We
dine punctually. GOOL will show you your room. If you want
anything, ask GOOL: he will see to you."

DARLING OLD
PUNCH,
Do you really
think that the
Electric Light is
going to do away
with gas? I
should so like to
know, not that Pa
or anybody I care
about has got
money in a Gas
Company's shares
that I know
of, but there
is one point on
which I am very
anxious, and I
don't think at least
I haven't heard
that anything has
been said, indeed,
what is very
strange, it doesn't
seem to have
struck anybody,
and at any rate it
is a most serious
matter, because
whether or no the
Electric Light is to
cut out gas in
streets and houses
there seems no
doubt it answers
for warehouses and
galleries and Gov-
ernment work-places, and all sorts of large rooms. So there is
every prospect of its being used in Assembly-Rooms and Bail-
Rooms. Now then this is the question which occurs to me of course,
and no doubt also to every thinking girl, and many I dare say have
written to the papers and not had their letters put in, but I hope
you will mine, and then perhaps Mr. EDISON—I think that is his
name—or some of his agents—don't you call them P—will give me
an answer: Is the Electric Light—when used to illuminate a Marble
Hall, or a salon of fashion, or any other Rooms in which one mingles
with Society—suitable to the complexion? j.^j. y0ura
VANESSA.
P.S.—There is also another thing I should like to know. Sorne-
times; at scientific lectures, I have seen Electricity used to produce
chemical changes. Besides making the natural colour look horrid,
mightn't the effect of the Electric Light perhaps be to turn any
little artificial bloom one might use to something dreadful?

JOHN HOMESPUN ON IMPERIALISM.
IMPERIALISM! Hang the werd! II buzzes in my noddle
Like bumble-bees in clover-time. The talk on't 's mostly twaddle;
Yet one would like to fix the thing, as farmers nail up vermin;
Lots o' big words collapse, like blobs, if their sense you once determine.
1 guess I 'm English, root and branch, though some smart babes feign
doubt of it.
(Your Cockerels now do crow so loud, old roosters seem quite out
of it)
To think BRITANNIA rules the waves is soothing to my feelings,
But let her rule 'em right, say 1, and stick to honest dealings.
If that's un-English, as I 'm told, parochial and the rest of it,
80 be it; right is my North Star, I shan't hedge east or west of it;
And if Imperialism means to shift my eonscienoe-oompass,
They won t get me to shout for it with all their row and rumpus.
I smoke my pipe and hear 'em prate, and don't they pitch it nobby?
You'd think Creation owned JOHN BULL its Heaven-appointed
Bobby.
But how if Bobby'drops true blue, and takes to private prigging?
If masts and yards ain't straight and square, you can't expect taut
rigging.
No doubt the sharks would like to rule the seas to suit their wishes,
And whales aren't much concerned about the rights of little fishes;
But a sea-scourge is scarce the part JOHN BULL is proud of playing,
Unless from paths he's stuck to long he now is bent on straying.
Imperialism most times means rule ruthless as far-reaching,
Shaped on the sharp Squeers system of much stick and little teaching.
Masters grow plump on it, no doubt, but power and paunches
swelling
Ain't quite the sort o' things to set a British patriot yelling.
Some do, no doubt. More blame, say I, to leaders fancied clever,
Who, playing on the nation's heart, its finer chords touch never;
They strum and thrum on selfish greed, and vulgar pride and
swagger,
Until the empty row they raise great Shindy's self might stagger.
Bah! If Old England can't look big without so much drum-
thumping,
She's littler-hearted than I've thought. I own this brazen
trumping
Don't warm my blood up, not a mite, its grandeur I can't follow;
'Tis noisy as the drum itself, and just about as hollow.
I grant that men of British breed should steer and pull together,
And all stand by, blow low, blow high, in a spell of dirtv weather;
If that's Imperial, 'tis a tune with which I never jangled,
Though it seems to me a good old air spoilt by a name new-fangled.
But pluck that's sound down to the core has got no call to swagger,
To paint its nose to fright its foes, or nourish a big dagger;
That style o' thing means bounce, not fight, however loud it holler,
And won't stand cuffs, I '11 bet a pot, for all its show of choler.
A ruling race has got to ride, but ruling don't mean robbery,
Still less the game of trick for trick, and everlasting bobbery;
And if what's called " Imperial" in fashionable lingo
Ain't tainted with such humbug to the core, why I 'm a Jingo!

Somehow the phrase seems getting flat and fusty.

A path of peace, and jocund jollity:

No ropes, no rings, and, above all, no goads.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(A Visit to tha T.'nirerxity of Cambridge, on an important and
interesting Occasion.)
SIB,
Br special
invitation,
accepted with
the greatest pos-
sible pleasure, I
witnessed th
performance last
Wednesday, on
"th'e Ladies'
Night," in the
Rooms of the
A.D.C. (Ama-
teur Dramatic
Club), Cam-
bridge.
The arrange-
ments for my
reception at the
Railway Station
did honour alike
to the Heads—
and Hearts—of
the University.
The first idea
was, that, on the
platform,! 1 should be] met by all the Heads of Houses, with their
tiles off.
This having been abandoned on account of the inclemency of the
weather, the following ceremonial programme was submitted to me
for approval:—
First, the Vice-Chancellor, attended by the Commissary, a most
useful officer superintending the University Commissariat; the
Deputy High Steward (whose duty it is to accompany the Vice-
Chancellor whenever he may go from Dover to Calais), carrying a
golden basin and gilt brandy-flask, the insignia of his office; the
Registrary, who combines the offices of Inspector of Smoky Chimneys
with that of performing the marriage service for such members of
the University as come to him at the Registrar's Office; the Sex
Viri, without power to add to their number, as an addition would
un-sex them; the Auditors of the Chest, carrying stethescopes;
Proctors, followed by Bull-dogs (muzzled), and the Two Moderators,
smoking, on account of their wicks having been turned up too high.
Lastly, the Examiners, each carrying his own tripos, followed by the
Lady Margaret Preacher, in her best cap and silk gown.
As, however, I myself had dispensed with anything resembling
display, being simply attired in a graceful garment called after the
Ulster King--of-ArmSj and was only accompanied by my very great
friend (six feet five, if he's an inch) and constant legal adviser—a
first-rate all round man—Professor PELL, Reversible Barrister, I
telegraphed to say that I preferred to remain incog., and would, in
the quietest way, take an ordinary hansom from the Station to the
College, where my excellent host—of whom it is no disparagement
to speak as a Fellow—would be waiting to receive me.
Arrived at the College, I was at once installed in another Fellow's
rooms—the worthy Bedmaker, and the obliging Gyp, assisting at the
ceremony of installation.
"What," I asked myself, after a quarter of an hour's experience of
the bachelor comfort of this ancient snuggery, "what can equal the
existence of a College-Fellow with a pied-d-terre always ready, no
difficultyastoscrvants.no trouble as to house-keeping—and with
but one drawback that I can see, and that is, no bells."
But is not the absence of bells a sign that your every want is anti-
cipated?
Look—here are beautiful fires in both rooms beaming a welcome—
here on the hob is a steaming kettle, and the neatness, tidiness, and
cleanliness of the chambers are distinct evidences of the tender care
and softening influence of that female society, provided by the
authorities of each College for the solace of its celibate residents,
which is honourably known as the "Ancient Order of Academic
Bedmakers."
We—another guest is with me, not the Eminent Reversible-
mount to our rooms in an ancient tower, by a spiral stone staircase,
with narrow windows set in deep embrasures, reminding me at
every step of some of CHUIKSHANK'S illustrations to AINSWOBTH'S
Tower of London: and,what with this staircase, and the windows
and the massive doors, and the medircval appearance of the rooms
themselves, I cannot shake off the impression that my friend and
myself are two important political prisoners, treated in a very supe-
rior manner as bents our rank and the nature of our crime—nothing
less than high treason, of course—ascending to our rooms in the
Tower, where presently the Lieutenant will visit us, and address us
with kindly and courteous consideration.
But the caps and gowns destroy this Tower illusion, which is
superseded at*nce by another of a meditcval ecclesiastical character,
which is far truer than the first, and more in keeping with tlio
local colouring.
Many have told of the monks of old—and so there is no necessity
for me to add my observations. Suffice it that we were presently
summoned to the monastic cell of one of the Brethren, whore we were
entertained in the pleasantest, merriest company, with the very best
of good cheer, until it was time for us to walk to the Club Rooms of
the A.D.C., and take our seats in the Auditorium of their elegant
little Theatre.
The Play was The Ticket of Leave Man, and it was the third
night of its representation. The Amateurs (and among them are
some genuine young artists) had been coached in the business of
the Stage by Mr. HORACE WIGAN, who, it will be remembered, was
the original "JItiickshaw, the Detective." at the Olympic—a part
with which he will always be identified in the memory of play-
goers.
The Ticket of Leave Man was played at the A.D.C. in five Acts,
and the minor comic parts of Green Jones and Emily St. Evrcmondc
were wisely omitted.
There is nowadays an unofficial censorship of Plays at Cambridge,
this boing'the condition on which the existence of the Club is tolerated
and recognised by the Dons.
It was not so in its first days—some twenty years ago, when the
Club was, so to speak, a sort of Secret Society in the Catacombs, and
when the nights of performance were kept a profound secret from
all except the initiated. Subsequently came a semi-official recogni-
tion, but there was no censorship. I fancy that then we went in more
for " the fun of the thing;" than for its Art. Now there is a marked
improvement in everything that may be taken aa evidence of careful
study, and of real earnestness of purpose in the performance of each
one of the corps dramatique, from the principals down to excellently-
trained "Supers," who were never obtrusive, or careless, as either
"Quests" or "Navvies," though there are chances in this piece that
might be easily taken advantage of by less loyal amateurs, who are
too often so ready to sacrifice the general success to some particular
exhibition of inane frivolity. No: the A.D.C. Supers in the Ticket
of Leare Man were, in every way, perfect.
One may safely praise Supers, even amateur ones; they get so
little of it; but Amateur Actors (all good in this case), are, as to
their particular points of excellence, super criticam, as the old
German Emperor was super grammatical**.
The performance over, we returned to the hospitable board pre-
sided over by our monastic host; and if there 'was a bell which
summoned the cloistered Fellows to Prime (nothing, however, could
have been more prime than the supper), it failed to arouse, from a
peaceful slumber, YoTJE KErKESENTATITK.
P.S. New piece at the Princess's; and our old friend, Sulphegor,
at Drury Lane. Belphegor used to be the best of all Mr. CHARLES
DILLON s parts. I hope to be able to say something about it in my
next. New Burlesque at the Gaiety, and Old Comedies, and ZAZEL
—FAHREN and FABISI—at the Aquarium. All alive, 0! alive, 0!
Awe-fully Jolly!
"An action was tried last week in which the Society of Apothecaries sought
to recover penalties from a chemist, for having acted aa an apothecary without
a certificate. The principal witness for the Society of Apothecaries was Sir.
JOLLY DEATH."
DEATH to the dying may look grim;
E'en to the halest, melancholy;
But when the Craft subpoena him,
We find for once that Death is jolly.
The Latest Secession.
'The Hev. ORBY SHIPLEY, M.A., one of the leading lUtualists, was re-
ceived into the Church of Home, on Saturday last."
IT is whispered that in the event of the POPE reappearing in public
to give his blessing to the people, the Reverend Gentleman named
above will visit Rome in order to participate specially in the Papal
Benediction—" Urbi et ORBY."
THE LEGION OF HOKOUB.
VEXED that this Cross they 're not allowed to wear,
Though France was very willing to bestow it,
Some of our workers at its late World-Fair
Have made themselves a little cross—and show it!

A PAGE FROM KELLY'S DIRECTORY.
IF the Chief Baron's fashion of introducing personal politics
into legal procedure and Civic ceremonial be followea, it may lead to
strange results. On occasion of a Brewster Sessions, for instance,
how would it look, if the granting or refusing of a licence were
ushered in.by something like this from the Chairman of the Bench
of Magistrates ?—
"Mr. BUNG, you are the holder of a beer and spirit licence for
a tavern known as the "Pig and Whistle." You came here to ask
that that licence may be renewed. Sir, it is my duty as Chairman
of this Bench of Magistrates,; to impress upon you that a public-
housekeeper has many heavy responsibilities. Not only does ne sell
beer and spirits across the bar, but, also across that bar, he has
frequent opportunities of influencing, if not of forming, by his con-
versation the opinions of his customers. It is most important, there-
fore, that he should have sound Apolitical views in the present very
critical position of European affairs. Mr. BUNG, it is my proud, if
not pleasing, duty to inform you, that I regard the most solemn
assurances of the Emperor of RUSSIA with the greatest possible dis-
trust. Far be it from me to say anything that may seem to detract
from the weight of a Sceptre, or impair the authority of a Throne
in this or any other country; but I am bound to point out to you,
and through you, to your customers, that the CZAS is a Potentate,
who, were there any machine for weighing human, as there is for
weighing metallic sovereigns, would, I fear, have to be set aside as
not up to standard. In this respect he may be said to stand- alone
among his elevated order. If I may resort to classical antiquity
for a parallel, I might quote, in application to him, the pointed, and
not unfamiliar, line of HORATITJS FLACCUS :—
'Rara :ivis in terris, nigroque Bimillima cygno.'
Nay more"; not only is he, in my matured judgment, a black
swan, but a very black swan. He is even, I am of opinion, much
blacker than he is painted in the Daily Telegraph 'and the Pall
Mall Gazette.
Having said this much, I am sure, Mr. BUNG, that you will
listen with interest to my opinion of the Treaty of Berlin. Some
may regret that it does not go further; but I am satisfied that it is
a very good Treaty, as far as it goes. Perhaps if it went farther
the world might fare worse. But, Mr. BUNG, when I have made
this admission, it would be perfectly absurd to attempt to hide
from you my conviction, as regards the Turk, that it would have
been well for England to have put forth all her power in aid of
that interesting and intrepid people's destinies long before the
snow-strewn Balkans were surmounted, and the blood-stained
heights of Plevna stormed. Slightly altering the words of a great
popular song-maker—you will, I doubt not, remember the pro-
found saying of FLETCHER of Saltoun, a Scotch worthy with
whose spoken and written wisdom you are doubtless familiar:
"Let me make the songs of a people, and let who will make their
laws "—
"We did not want to fight,
But had the necessity for the sacrifice arisen,
We had the ships, we had the men,
We had also the necessary pecuniary means!"
This being so, Mr. BUNG, we can offer no sufficient apology for our
inaction. Having said this much on the painful topic commonly
known as the Eastern Question, I now come to our North-West
Indian frontier. You have doubtless heard that some of our ablest
Indian statesmen and soldiers have insisted that we have made a false
step in forcing the AMEEH of Afghanistan into the arms of Russia.
They have staked their reputations upon this assertion. These
veteran statesmen and' soldiers have filled many columns of the
morning papers with arguments in support of this conclusion. In
the most positivejmanner they have declared that our Government
is in the wrong. I will use only four words in reply, but those four

JINGO'S DUE.
YE friends of Peace, if sore tried, ne'er forget
How much we 're all of us in Jingo's debt.
As Mars the War-God, Jingo to invoke,
Just served to turn a war-whoop to a joke.
The name of Jingo sticks like pitch and tar,
To bellowers for battle with>the CZAB, •
'Gainst ranting fire-eaters it raised a laugh,
And, in reply to fustian, won them chaff.
Who knows but Europe all in flames might be,
0 Jingo, at this moment, but for thee?
What bloodshed we should rue, what broken bones,
Ships sunk, and sailors sent to Davey Jones,
Hadst thou not, Jingo, made war's howl absurd.
HACDEBMOTT, thanks for teaching us that word!
A Recommendation.
THE organs of the Osmanli have set forth their reasons
for accepting as trustworthy the evidence given before
the Rhodope Commission of atrocities committed on the
Turks by the Russians in Eastern Roumelia, and their
virtuous indignation at the abominable humanitarians
who decline to take the truth of that evidence for granted.
The Spectator this week gives us reasons for rejecting
the same evidence as untrustworthy. This is eminently
a case in which all would be disposed to appeal to the
'• authority of a Spectator. Let our readers weigh the two
sets of reasons, and say which carries most weight to
their minds.
i
Complex Conundrum.
WHAT is the difference between the "irresponsible
frivolity" of a stump speaker at Rhyl, and "the hair-
brained chatter " of a post-prandial orator at the Mansion
House?
Answer.—The first was "inebriated with the exuber-
ance of his own verbosity ;" the second was "verbose
with the exuberance of his own inebriation."
A MATTER OF COURSE.

words should be conclusive to all well-regulated minds. I don't
think so.'
Having now disposed of the CZAR and the AMEER, I have only to add,
incidentally, that I strongly disapprove of GAIIBETTA, and cannot give
my unqualified approbation to Prince von BISMARCK. It appears to
me, too, Mr. BUNG, that a decided improvement might be made in
the Government of Japan. I am sure that Captain BURNABY would
do that country a service were he to take a ride in that direction.
Captain BUKNABY is so fearless that we cannot say of him—
"Post equitem sedet atra cura;"
and we can only wish him as complete a triumph over the Cau-
cuses of the Black Country as the Black Sea. And now, Mr.
BUNG, as we have to get through a great deal of business before
lunch, I will merely remind you that BRITANNIA is the pride of the
ocean, the ruler of the waves, and the tutelary goddess of that
gallant body of Britons who never, never, under any consideration
whatever, will consent to submit to the chain of slavery.
Mr. Bung. Thank you, Sir, but how about my licence?
The Chairman. Oh, I quite forgot to tell you, that as the police
have given in an unfavourable report of the management of your
tavern for" the lastjtwelvemonths, we have decided to refuse the "Pig
and Whistle" its licence this year. Good morning.

severely from the unac-
countable failure of coats, cartridges, and commissariat, owing to

liussias to the
April 1 (New Style), 8 A.M.
DEAR GENERAL,
I HAVE read your frank and friendly answer to my letter
with cordial sympathy. AVhat I propose is that we should settle this
awkward affair, on behalf of our respective august Sovereigns,
by dividing into two equal shares all we can lay hands upon in the
public treasury, reserving to ourselves the right of annexing as much
private property as we can conveniently carry off. I would further
suggest that we might toss for the guns, public buildings, the Royal
collection of wild animals, and (if you see no objection to it), His
Royal Highness the AMEER himself. Such an arrangement seems to
me to be the only one that could be honourably entertained by two
great, if, for the moment, impecunious powers. Assuring you that
I have not touched a kopec of my salary for the last eighteen months,
I am, with profound homage, &c., &c.
The Commander-in- Chief of Her Imperial Britannic Majesty's
Forces before Cabul to the Representative of His Imperial
Majesty the Czar of all the Russias inside the same.
MY DEAR GENERAL, 9 A'M- AP"1 *' 1879'
I AM too old a soldier not to appreciate the confidence with
which your letter concluded. You will be prepared for my assurance
of warm sympathy, when I tell you that I had to raise money on my
best uniform before I could get away from Peshawur, and am safe
to be " wanted" by more than one Sheriffs Officer on my return1
to Simla, should I be spared to reach it. This comes of making war
without first providing its sinews; but when the Exchequer is
empty, and the VICEROY has, entre nous, to trust -to what he can
make by publishing his poems by subscription, a poor old soldier
must not grumble. To revert to the business immediately in hand.
I am agreeable to the course you suggest, but would prefer throwing
you in both the tigers and the AMEER, as we might find a difficulty,
in making proper commissariat arrangements for them under existing
circumstances. What do you say? Yours sincerely,
&c., &c.

DELIGHTED to oblige vou if I could, but I am afraid that
while my august Sovereign could, I doubt not, easily find room for
the tigers at the St. Petersburg Gardens, there might be some diffi-
culty about His Royal Highness. However, if you can't place the
AMEER in London, I can ascertain whether there is likely to be an
opening for him shortly in Siberia or the Caucasus.

MY DEAR GENERAL. NOON, April 1, 1879.
SHALL we take it as settled that, 9n behalf of His Majesty
the Czar of All the Russias, you take the tigers as an equivalent to
our taking the AMEER? Thus.you will not have to put your Govern-
ment to any trouble about Siberia; and I think I shall be able to
arrange for the appearance of His Afghan Highness at the West-
minster Aquarium, though his engagement may have to be deferred
till the termination of ZAZEL'S still attractive performance, which is,
as you will easily understand, and as ROBERTSON has reminded me
by telegraph, as yet uncertain. He expresses confidence, which, he
says, FARINI shows with him, that the AMEER will bo a "great
draw." He adds, playfully, that the Aquarium only wants one
drawer at a time; not a whole chest of drawers. Begging that this
correspondence may now close, as I have to give your messenger a
shilling every time,
I am yours, most sincerely, &c., &c.
ECHOES OF THE BACK-STAIRS.
(By Our Otcn Man at Other People's Key-holes.)
THE LORD CHANCELLOR, your readers will probably be interested
to learn, is a master of the happy art of enforcing his political views
with professional aphorisms, thus .putting what may be called a tine
legal point on the truth, and driving it, if one may so say, home.
After the momentous Cabinet Council of the other day, at which
it was determined to give the troublesome ruler of Afghanistan a
last chance, as Ministers were breaking up—for the time—CAIRNS
turned back from the door-way to call to SALISBURY, who was
chatting with BEACONSFIELD by the fireplace,—
"And don't forget to tell ScnotiVALOw to remind the CZAR of the
legal maxim—' Quifacitper (fihere) Alium, facit per se.'"
BEACONSFIELD'S usual imperturbable insensibility to Cabinet
attempts at wit was, for once, fairly broken down. He tripped,
rather than toddled, across the Cabinet-room, and, grasping CAIRNS'S
hand, said heartily,—" I should like to have said that.
SALISBURY has been repeating the mot, and not always, I am
afraid, with due acknowledgment of the authorship. One is glad
to set that all right.

".An uncommonly clever summary that of DODSON'S at Chester!"
Sir STAFFORD remarked, with his usual candour and readiness to
do justice to his opponent's, the Permanent Secretary, over a glass of
sherry, at the Treasury luncheon the other day. '' Brings out the
telling points in favour of their own Budgets, and against ours,
capitally: above all, so clearly."
Clearly? Umpn!" said LINGEN. in his dry way, which, how-
ever, masks a great deal of sardonic humour, "then it isn't a case
of DODSON and Fog, at all events!"
This allusion to the once famous Pickwickian firm was not for the
moment obvious to the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, whose per-
ception of a joke is not of the quickest. But when I JNGEN explained
it to him, he seemed to enjoy it; at least, he laughed heartily.
I had thought of sending this really good thing to the keen-witted
Member for Chester, who would thoroughly have appreciated both
the point of the allusion, and the compliment from an opponent.
On second thoughts, I determined to let the world have it, in an Echo.

When the Secretary of the Admiralty waited on the PREMIER last
•week with news of the brilliant success of the embarkation at Liver-
pool of the new Governor-General of the Dominion, and his charm-
ing and affable Princess LOUISE.—or even " LOUIE,"—as one feels
tempted to call one who has made herself so much at home in all
hearts and circles—on hearing that they had had the Storm- Cock
for tender while their steamer was the Sarmatian.—"Two names
for the same ship, /should have thought," put in BEACONSFIELD.
EOERTON evidently did not take.
"Don't you see?" rather testily rejoined the PREMIER,—gout
does not improve the temper.—"Sarmatian means Scythian; and
Scythian means Russian; and surely the Russian is just now the
Storm-cock of the walk!'
EGEBTON might have felt some irritation at having had to look a
request for the explanation; but he knew his man too well to let
this out. So he swallowed his annoyance, and booked the joke for
Club-colportage. I hope I am not " wiping his eye" as we say
en bdttne at Sandringham.

MILLERS AND THEIR MEN.
(A Civil Service Examination in connection with the Board of Trails.)
ExAtrrxsR. Now, Sir, what is calico?
Candidate. Sir, there is theoretical calico—and practical calico.
Theoretical calico is a textile fabric manufactured from cotton—the
laniferous envelope of the seeds of Gossypium herbaceum. That is
rare. Practical calico is the more common thing.
Examiner. Indeed, Sir! And how do you describe that?
Candidate. Practical calico, Sir, the calico of commerce, and
especially the calico designed for exportation, is formed in part only
of cotton. It consists, besides, of size—a mixture composed of flour,
China clay, Epsom salts, chlorate of zinc, chlorate of magnesia, and
glue, in the proportion of from 70 or 80 to 130, and even 200 per
cent.
Examiner. This information is new to us, Sir.—Will you oblige
me with its origin?
Candidate. Certainly, Sir. You will find the facts and figures I
have had the honour to state in a recent issue of the Liverpool
Mercury, quoted by the Pall Mall Gazette. They occur in the
report of a law case—a suit between a cotton manufacturer and a
firm of cotton warp-sizers, respecting a disputed charge for cotton
warp-sizing. It is a distinct business—I had almost said branch of
industry. The details I have given you were furnished by one of
the plaintiffs, who coolly avowed his acts. In conclusion, he said he
had been " in the trade twenty years, and in commencing only put
5 per cent, into the warps, and the size then consisted solely of flour,
but now they had to add chemicals to get the weight up, as manu-
facturers asked them for more weight."
Examiner. Does any adage in an elementary educational work
occur to you as applicable to that gentleman's career?
Candidate. Nemo repente fuit turpissimus.
Examiner. Very well, Sir. In respect to composition, can you
point to any analogy between cotton and silk?
Candidate. Silk proper, Sir, is simply woven from the chrysalis-
coceoon of the Bombyx mori. The silk you purchase is, much if not
most of it,'' loaded," as it ii called, with logwood and gum. The web is
sent to the dyer weighing, say, sixteen ounces. ;\ It is returned to the
silk-miller with its weight increased by from twenty-four up to forty
ounces—the result of loading with matter in the wrong place.
Examiner. Can you name any other description of business cor-
responding to that of cotton warp-jizers and silk-loaders P
Candidate. The business of stolen-plate-melters, or of sausage-
grinders who load their sausages up with a large per-centage of
carrion and cat's meat.
Examiner. What practical inference, Sir, would you deduce from
the existence of businesses and practices such as you have described?
Candidate. That in a country where adulteration constitutes a
business of itself, there is very much to account for the depression
of trade. And that commodities formerly known as British goods"
are in the way to become notorious as British " bads."
Examiner. Can you suggest any means of limiting such objection-
able operations as cotton warp-sizing and silk-loading?
Candidate. Heavy fines and long terms of imprisonment with hard
labour.
Examiner. That will do, Sir. I have the pleasure to inform you
that your answers have given me complete satisfaction.
A Really Cruel Case.
HERE is a candid parson—a parson no doubt as deserving as
modest—who advertises in the Field, and to whom Punch ought to
be glad to give a " leg-up " :—
TO PATRONS.—An Incumbent, age 74, income under £400, wishes
PREFERMENT. Quite up to work. Address, &c.
Considering what Church livings are, can anything; be more
affecting than the agonising prayer for preferment of this ill-used
old Incumbent who, at seventy-four, finds himself with a Church
income of less than £400 a year 1 Shame! Patrons, where are
your blushes?

A PICTURE OF A PRESIDENT.
WITH MB. PUNCH'S CONGRATULATIONS (BY ANTICIPATION) TO SIR FREDKRICK LEIOHTON, P.R.A.
FRIENDS AT A DISTANCE.
Being the brief Record of a few Winter-seasonable Visits to certain
Country Houses.
VISIT THE FIEST.—CHATTEB III.
At Josslyn Dyke's—The House—Passage — Stairs— Clock—Bogie
Corners—Phantom Sutler—Cliambei—Portrait—Apparition—
Down Again—A Surprise—To be explained in our next.
IT is a solemn, silent house, this of JOSSLYN DTKE'S. Oak panel-
lings, easement windows in deep recesses. Doors in all sorts of un-
expected places. The house appears to have been built by some
architect who has gone mad on dark corners.
It seems as if this architect had said to himself in drawing his
plan, "Now, look here, we '11 have a great big staircase leading to a
dark corner halfway up to the first floor; then the second part of the
staircase shall finish at a landing where there are nothing but dark
corners."
The architect must have chuckled over this idea. No one remembers
his name, but it is supposed that he " flourished " in the Elizabethan
period. Flourished is a good word, if it were not suggestive of the ques-
tion, "What did he flourish?" Was it his stick with a handkerchief
tied to the end of it, to express joy on finishing his work? Or was it
his hat? Or did he simply flourish, not like a green bay-tree, but as
a great bay-window, which would be more appropriate to him as an
architect?
However, no matter how he flourished, or when, certain it is that
he must have been a man of infinite humour in his design for The
Mote, Mossend, which was apparently built with a view to the
accommodation of a large family of little Jack Homers, who could,
with smallest possible chance of observation, sit in various corners,
eating a corresponding number of Christmas pies.
Happy Thought for a Christmas book. The Homer Family. By
a " Corner Man." In a Horner-mental cover, price, &c.
After this one flight of stairs, which leads up to the first floor,
GOOL, the Phantom Butler, glides before me with my bag and a
candle, along a narrow strip of carpet.

THE HARD-HEADED BREED.
Sympathising Bystanders (about nn unfortunate Man who has been, knocked doicn, and stunned by the Train). "PooR MAN! TAKE HIM
TO THE STATION"
Injured One (recovering). "TYEK ME TO TB' STATION? WHAT FOB, THEN? IF AW'VE DUNE ONY HARM TO YO'R ENOINF, AW'S
WILLIN' TO PAY FOR'T!"
At tlie end of this passage something looms out upon us which
strikes me, at first, as not unlike a pump, without the handle.
Nearer approach shows it to be a gaunt, melancholy, yet military-
looking, clock. It bears a fanciful resemblance to a highly-finished
sentry-box in dark wood, with a front door to it, which the sentry
could lock alter him when he felt cold, and went in. If he opened
it now and stepped out, I don't think I should be very much sur-
prised. I am sure OOOL wouldn't be. If goblin Jack Homers are
in all the dark corners, eating phantom Christmas pies—goblin"
goblins—then there is another phantom Jack-in-the-box, in the
sentry-box, who comes out perhaps when the clock sounds mid-
night. Involuntarily I take out my watch to compare London time
with what they accept as the correct thing down here, so as to accom-
modate myself to my host's views in regard to punctuality at meals.
But the clock's face gives me no information. It is a yellowish
complexion, which, being of metal, was once, perhaps, as bold as
brass, but now the numbers are almost illegible, except the ten and
the two, which form a pair of eyes on either side of a little round
discoloured button of a nose, from which depend, at two acute
angles, left and right, two straight dark lines, really the hands,
which have the appearance of moustachios of the same period as the
house—i.e., the Elizabethan.
"That clock, Sir," observes GOOL the butler, solemnly, in answer
to my inquiry—" that clock never tells the time. It never has done,
since I 've been here." He says it with pride, and with a touch of
sympathy in his voice, that makes him, for a second, almost human,
at afl events, a trifle less ghostly. I notice, afterwards, that when
JOSSLYN speaks of his clock he does so in the same tone of affectionate
pride, as one would do of a superannuated servant who had done his
work in his day, and had become a pensioner of the family.
"No, Sir," says a footman afterwards coming upon me suddenly,
(everyone comes across everyone else suddenly in JOSSLYN DYKE'S
house, they are all surprise passages), while I am examining this
clock; examining, but not consulting it any more than I should think
of consulting a nonagenarian physician who had lost his memory—
"no, Sir. You can never get the time from that clock. We always
take it from the one in the hall or the kituhen. The little one in the
dining-room ain't much use; it goes well enough, but it generally
gets very fast."
Of course, the little one in the dining-room is scarcely fifteen years
old. A giddy thing, bright and Frenehitted (the gift of some kind
friend who wanted to brighten up the general gloominess of The
Mote), a go-a-head sort of fellow, a kind of clock that never pays in
the end, always tick, tick, tick, always fast, thoroughly unprin-
cipled, never to be relied on for a moment, much less for an hour.
Hut the old Clock on the Stairs that never mil tell the time! That
keeps its own counsel in its own case! That not by sound, or sign,
ever lets out its secret. That watches everything and says nothing!
Why is this clock silent? Did it neglect to speak once, on some fear-
fully important occasion, when its voice ought to have forbidden the
banns of marriage, and, as the penalty, had ever afterwards to hold
its tongue? I must ask JOSSLYN DYKE about this clock. Proceed,
GOOL, this confidential clock interests me much.
Through a small door into a narrow passage. Through another
small door, and on to another staircase. More doors, more corners,
dimly lighted by one gas jet shining through a pale green medium.
One more door. My chamber.
Our entrance with the candle seems to disperse the shadows which
were gathered about the hearth, as if the superior Phantom Butler had
said " Come! No loitering about here! It won't do, you know

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Move on! Xo hanging about and haunting here, 'cos I won't have
it "—and I become aware of the presence of a cheerful fire, in—for
the architect couldn't resist the temptation even here—in a dark
corner. The dog-grate is in a deep tiled recess—the back is coal
black—the tiles are smoked black—the woodwork about is almost
black—the dog-irons are black—and as the fire is the very model of
a fire for roasting chestnuts by, there being no name—it sheds a
jjlow which has a warm and cheerful appearance, but which fails
in reaching a single corner.
There are two candles on the dressing-table, which GOOL lights; but
twenty of the best wax wouldn't illuminate this room satisfactorily.
A casement window in a deep recess. Dark and drafty. Old
faded brown, Scotch snuff-coloured curtains, which have had a
serious quarrel, and won't meet, despite all attempts at reconcilia-
tion on the part of friendly intervention. Pitch dark outside.
The bed is enormous, and funereal, reminding me of a lying-in-
state. There are four dark, sturdy, posts, and sis dingy, heavy
curtains; a patchwork coverlet, of many colours, as though they 'd
caught and killed a poor old faded Harlequin, and had stuffed his
skin for this purpose; a large pillow, and watch-pockets for two,
pinned on to a sort of patternless tapestry back-ground.
GOOL unpacks for me: sees that everything is ready, and then
becoming absorbed into the deep shadow, he melts away suddenly,
and disappears—through the door, I suppose; but the door is in-
visible, and his movements were inaudible, so that I couldn't swear
positively, in a court of justice, to either the means or manner of
his exit.
A languor steals over me. I should like to sleep before the fire,
if there were a comfortable chair, or to go straight to bed, then and
there. This influence is so strong on me, that 1 surprise myself in
the act of unconsciously winding up my watch.
This discovery causes me to pull myself together, and rouse
myself for a supreme effort.
The supreme effort is taking off my coat. After which I stare
vacantly at the fire, and then, reversing my position, I stare at the
bed. Then I wonder what the room was originally used for; then
becoming more accustomed to the light, such as it is, I am sud-
denly startled by seeing what, on the instant, appears to me to be
somebody looking at me through a hole up above the wainscot, on
the wall opposite the side of the bed furthest from the window.
Of course in another second I am aware of its being a picture.
The old stories recur to me of the top of the bed slowly descending,
as the picture gradually disappears from view; of the concealed
assassin watching his victim through the portrait's eyes; and 1 am
compelled to take a candle, and examine the painting closely. 11' ~
to myself, "I wonder whom it's by?" I look for the name
the artist. Then I say to myself, "I suppose it 'a a portrait." Th,_
I get on a chair so as to place myself via-a-cis with the face of this
grim-looking Spaniard in black doublet and ruff, and once more I
soliloquise,'' queer looking old chap "—but somehow in speaking of him
in this manner, I feel inclined to beg his pardon for the liberty, and to
account for it as a lapsus Imgttts, caused by my nervousness on the
introduction. I with to look on it, and speak of it, and think of it,
as a work of art, and as a curiosity; but, somehow, though I have
taken the greatest pains to put myself on a familiar footing with the
picture, I feel the picture has got the better of me, and though as I
wash my hands, I say to myself in a vague sort of dashing incredulous
way, "How absurd! ridiculous! Ha! ha! ha!"—yet I can't
help looking over mv shoulder to see if anything has happened, and
if the picture, or rather the.three-quarter man in the picture, is still
where he was.
[Happy Thought.—Three-quarter man. No legs. But even this
doesn't entirely reassure me, as I have an uncanny sort of feeling
that legs are, so to speak, ' no object to him,' if he once took it into
his head (which he has got) to come down, and have a look round.]
A bell rings solemnly from some part of the house. Dinner, ]
suppose. I hurry on with my dressing, but from time to time I cast
a glance at the picture to see what he s doing.
I am startled by a sepulchral voice saying, "Are you ready, Sir?'
It is the apparition of GOOL. He has come, like the statue of the
Commendatore in Don Giovanni, to take me below to dinner.
It has occurred to JOSSLYN DYKE that I may not be able to fine
my way, and he has dispatched GOOL to be my guide.
Phantom Butler, I come to dinner. Alas, poor Ghost! lead on, ]
follow.
I expect the evening will be awfully slow and dull.
What do I hear?
Voices '( Merriment in the distance? Impossible!
GOOL throws open a door in a corner,—always a corner,—leading
out of a dark passage.
And I sea before me .... I can hardly believe my eyes.

FOX-HUNTING ACCORDING TO LAW.
NE of the most successful
speeches in a very suc-
cessful Comedy, London
Assurance, is a description
priven by a hunting heroine
of the pleasures
of a fox-chace.
Should the piece
be revived, Lady
Gay Spanker t
famous "bit"
will have to be
re-written up to
the judgments in
the henceforth
leading case of
Paul \.Summer-
hayes; some-
what after this
style:—
Lady Gay
Spanker (with
enthusiasm). Ah!
what is more de-
lightful than a
fox-hunt! What
more brilliant
than the muster
of pinks at the
cover-side, more harmonious than the music of the hounds! See
low they dash into cover! Mark their feathering sterns among
:he gorse! Ha! gone away! Sly Reynard has broken cover.
Yoicifs—for'rard! Off we go—away we dash over bull-fincher
md though bramble, master, whips, field, hounds and all! The
Sly Reynard knows the laws of the land, and, rogue that he is, has
sought shelter in a farmer's field. The tenant—a red-faced,
blithe-voiced Yeoman—warns us against trespass. What are we to
do? The Whipper-in looks at the Huntsman, the Huntsman looks
at the Master, and the Master consults his Solicitor! And now we
are off again! But how is this? The horses are leading, the hounds
behind. We dash away to the railway-station, dismount, and take
our return-tickets. Away! away! We are tearing up to London
in the Express! In we go to Westminster Hall. Our case is on!
Now dashing over a leading case, now running down a sly point,
and anon topping a stiff argument! And then, yoicks! off again
to the gorse-patch in the field where Sir Reynard is lurking still.
But now it is our turn. We '11 have no more trespassing; but we
will have our Fox all the same. The Master dismounts, and gaily
springs over the stile. The hounds look on, their sterns feathering in
the summer wind. The tenant himself grumbles, but he has to sub-
mit to the ruling of the Court. The Master's object is not sport, but
the destruction of a noxious vermin. See how he beats the bushes.
Ah! Sir Reynard knows how to hide! No; he has found him I He
grusps him by the brush! He draws his revolver! Whoo-hoop!
Bang! goes the pistol; and Reynard tumbles over like a cock
pheasant! And see the eager hounds, how they leap, and whine,
and tussle for their prey, while I receive the Brush! Ah! what
sport so delightful, «o delirious, as a Fox-hunt—one of the modern
kind—according to the ruling in Paid v. Summtrhayet!

OUR MAYORS.
LONG ere this the telegraph and telephone have made it known that there
is a prospect of Peace—at Wycombe. (We are not Chaffin if the Mayor of Bath
is.) Perhaps Sir WILFRID will wish we were, when it is disclosed to him that
the Bottle is supreme at Dover, or Dr. CTTJTMING when he realises the presence
of a Stigant at Chatham and a Pope at Dorchester; the Deacon is at Walling-
ford, and the Clarke at Lincoln. There are rival Kings, like those of Brentford,
at Portsmouth and Lymington, a Marshall for each at Barnsley and Huntingdon,
a Knight at Hereford, and a Laird at Birkenhead.
The Mayor of Godalming is Eager, of Congleton Goode, of Shrewsbury Frail.
Saffron Walden is sound as a Bell, Peterborough is sound at the Core. There
should be eloquence with Tullv at Tynemouth, and "Harveian Orations"
from Harvey at Yarmouth. There is Nowell at Bootle, but then, as a com-
pensation, there is a Wellman at Windsor. Keadhead presides at South Shields,

ham rules in London; if Monmouth, Oswestry, Southampton, and Walsall all
have a Thomas, Pljrmouth has a James, Chester a Gilbert, Cardiff a Lewis,
Northampton a Dennis, and Dewsbury a Heugh, while Brighton takes its Davey!
Here is a happy municipal group! Salisbury with Lovibond, Preston with
Goodair, Canterbury with Goulden, Heading with Blandy. Rye (again and again)
with Meryon, Stoke with Sweeting, and the Flower of the flock at "Sweet
William's" Stratford-on-Avon.
Not now for the first time have we found refreshment in the pleasant country
associations which surround so many of our Mayors—a Grainge at Oxford and a
Hall at Lancaster; Brocklehurst at Macclesfield, Dugdale at Blackburn, Milburn
at Carlisle, Lethbridge at Guildford, Ridgway at Buckingham-Park at Bury.
Pollard at Bideford, Heath at Crewe, Groves and Thorn (again), at West Hartlepool
and Boston, our old friends Holyoake and Shrubsole at Droitwich, and Faversham.
There is still one Mayor left, at Southwold, and he is a—Remnant.
SCIENTIFIC RECTIFICATIONS.
_ ME. WILLIAM SIXES has announced his intention of scientifically rectifying
his service of plate during the ensuing winter. He has been annoyed when
entertaining his friends, to find he has to put up with an odd set of salt-spoons,
and he feels severely his deficiency in dish-covers. His plate has, in fact, been
collected at different times and on no (esthetic principle. He has lately been
put up to a chance by which a handsome family service of plate may be had
cheap.
*******
MAHY SMITH (35), lady's-maid, was accused before the Justices of Blankshire
with the theft of a seal-skin jacket, the property of her mistress. The accused
indignantly repudiated the charge of theft. She had long felt the extreme incon-
venience of winter woollen wraps, at once so heavy and no common, and had
merely availed himself of the hrst opportunity of scientifically rectifying her
wardrobe.
#»•#»•*
_ BENJAMIN- JINGO, banker's clerk, has had an unfortunate misunderstanding
with his employers. He had long been coming to the conclusion that his salary
required scientific rectification, and had, accordingly, annexed a parcel of bank-
notes of which he had charge. He urged in his defence that henad been sub-
jected to an unheard-of insult. On being asked what it was, he replied that it
might not be perhaps exactly an insult, but he had received an answer to his
request to be taken into partnership which no man of spirit could put up with,
his employers having said as much as that he had not yet rendered services to
the firm which called for that particular form of recognition.
MIRROR OF PARLIAMENT.
AT Lambeth Police Court the other day, THOMAS POPE, driver of a Brixton
omnibus, was pulled up before Mr. ELLISON, for obstructing a tram-car:—
"The defendant went at the rate of two miles an hour, and gave no heed to the whistle
of the driver of the tram-car. The defendant had acted on a former occasion in a similar
manner. . . . Mr. ELLISON told him it was a grots case, and had been fully proved.
If he continued that «y«tem of obstruction, he would be eent to prison without tie option
of paying a fine. He would have to pay a penalty of forty shillings and costs, or be
imprisoned for one month."
Instead of reporting this case as one of '' Police." the Times should have
recorded it under the nead of "Parliament out of Session." The conduct of
Mr. POPE on his omnibus-box before the tram-car is precisely analogous to that
of Messrs. BIGGAR, PAJUTELL, and Co., Home-Rulers, haranguing against time
in the House of Commons. What a pity that no Magistrate can deal with
St. Stephen's obstruotors as Mr. ELLISON dealt with the Brixton 'busman!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARL

A STRONG-HEADED HERO.
PUINTK BISMARCK,
by the account of
his Bozzy, Dr.
BuscH,is distinguished
not only by general
but also by particular
strength of head. His
brains are capable of
standing almost any
amount of liquor, like
those of SOCRATES and
Mynheer Van Dunk
—and some one else
whom modesty forbids
Punch to name. His
Highness once drank
a pot of champagne
and porter mixed, and
was none the worse.
He brags of having
beaten topers in beer-
houses. So confident
is he in the potency of
his potting, that he will
back himself to drink
against the world.
"He can hold forth
by the hour upon wine;
and on a dire occasion, spirits becoming scarce in the tenta, caused a desperate
appeal to be telegraphed home as to the strong need of a supply of gin
incontinently."
He is powerfully impressed with religious convictions, and pro-
fesses himself a decidedly Evangelical Christian. Thus the Prince
appears to be in a double sense a spiritually-minded man, as being
at once a fervent believer in " gin and true religion.'' and liking
both, according to the revelations vouchsafed to Dr. BUSCH, of the
strongest.
JUST THE MAN FOE HARD TIMES.
MR. PCITCH:—SUB,
IT do a man's eart good as is used to that nastiest, aggrawa-
tingest, and extravagantest of all uman creturs, the British Porper,
to know that in these ere days of sentimentle umbug about umanity
and sech like rubbidge, there is still Bords of guardians as knows
their dooty and ere and there a Chairman as is fit to teche em of it if
they didn't. Wich I have not read anythink for yeers and yeers so
truly refreshin to my feelins as a porochial officer owin a dooty
to the ratepayers as the report in the Warrington Examiner of a
late weekly meeting of the Board of Guardians for that borough—to
potions of which I ask your leeve to dror the attenshon it deserve:—
"One ROBERT EVANS, fitter, in the employ of Mr. KITCHEN, Scotland
Road Foundry for eighteen years up to last February, when he was discharged
in consequence of dulneas of trade, appeared before the Board asking for work.
In answer to Mr. BLECKLY, the applicant said he had been breaking stones
at the Workhouse for It. 6rf. per day. He had tried for a long time to get
work, but could not do so. He was very lame, as he hod lost his right foot.
He paid 4». M. a week for rent, had a wife and two boys to keep. One boy
was going to school, and the other was earning 3». per week. His wife could
not get work regularly. He had been minding the boiler and engine at the
Workhouse, but gave the work up and went back to stone-breaking.
"Mr. Hi, HCKi. v: Yes, that is just the way. I suppose you Would not mind
the boiler because you thought you did not get enougn money?
"Applicant, showing his footless leg, said the reason he gave it up was
because he had to go up and down a ladder, and with such a leg as he had he
could scarcely do it.
"Mr. MACKBY, roaster of the Workhouse, said the ladder in question was
an iron one, and it certainly was difficult for the man to go up ana down it.
"Mr. Iti.F.i-K i. v: Ah, yes; but I suppose if we hud offered you more money
you would have managed the ladder easily enough:
"APPLICANT: Well, I would have tried.
"Mr. BLECKLY: Exactly; and I think you should have the offer of the
boiler at 1*. C>//. per day, and nothing more. I certainly think 9e. a. week is
too much to give to a man who has an able-bodied wife, and only one boy to
keep. You must not expect we are going to give you money to enable you to
pay 4». 6rf. a week in rent. It is perfectly scandalous that you should come
here expecting such things."
Which well you may say "skandalus," Mr. BLBCKLY, And if
there wasn't men like you to give sech shameless wretches the lang-
widge they deserve, I should like to know where ratepayers
would be P
Ere'« another werry aggrawating offender, who gets what, if I
wur not a porochial hofficer, who knows what a fine nutrishus food
gruel is, I should call his gruel, from this ere upright-minded Chair-
man :—
"MARTIN HEALEY, a decent-looking labourer, next applied for work.
"Mr. BLECKLT: And why don't you get work? What is the good of coming
here P
"APPLICANT: I have tried all I can to get work. I havo walked about
for weeks, and have been to Liverpool, Garston, Manchester, and other places,
but cannot get work.
"Mr. BLECKLY: But you can get work, and have no business corning here.
"APPLICANT: I have been fifteen years in Warrington, and have never
troubled the Board before, and all I ask for now is work.
"Mr. BLBCKLY: And you ought not to have come now. What family
have yon f
APPLICANT: A wife and seven children.
Mr. BLECKLY: The idea of a man with seven children saying he cannot
get work!"
Rediklus, indeed!
"APPLICANT: Well, I hare tried long enough, and am willing to do any-
thing that may be offered.
"Mr. BLECKLY: You could have found plenty of work if you had been an
industrious steady man."
Not a doubt on it, I should say.
"APPLICANT: Well, Mr. Fooo (relieving officer) has my character, and I
don't think he can say anything against my character. A man with a wife
and seven children and labourer's wages has not much money left to be
unsteady with."
Sech imperence! But BLECKLT was down on him.
"Mr. BLECKLY: I have no doubt Mr. Fooo will tell me you have been
loafing about the streets smoking your pipe.
"APPLICANT: I have nine of a family to keep, and if I could find any work
I would not come here, I can assure you.
"Mr. BLECKLY: And what does your wife do?
"APPLICANT: Well, she cannot do much even if she could get the work.
"Mr. TAYLOE: I think it will take the wife all her time to look after the
husband.
"The Applicant having retired from the room for the Guardians to consider
his case,
"Mr. BLECKLY said: I don't know what we can do with such a man. He
seems to be of no use except for getting children for Her Majesty. (Laughter,
in which nearly all the Ouardiant joined.)
"It was resolved to give him 1». 6rf. a day; and just as the man was called
in, Mr. II. TAYLOR said he would give him 2>. a day if he would work on his
farm for it.
"APPLICANT (with apparent thankfulness) said he would gladly accept
the work, and left the room evidently pleased at the idea of getting more
money and more cheerful work than stone-breaking."
That ere TAYLOR, Mr. Punch, is "evidently one of your umanity-
mongers, which one on 'em is enough to spile a nabour'ood, and
pison poor men's minds in spite of all a ridgment of BLECKLTS and
such like true benefactors of their specieses can say or do to bring
'em to a sense of their situations.
Ere's another of this precious lot, as can't get wurk. Kiteh
em a gittin it as long as they can git out of its way !—
"ROQER COTTER was the next applicant for work.
"Mr. BLECKLY: What do you want?
"APPLICANT: Work, Sir.
"Mr. BLECKLY; Then why don't you get it f
"APPLICANT: Because I can't. I have worked at Burton wood for some
time for Widow Ku.sji A i.t,.
"Mr. BLECKLY: And why have you left?
"APPLICANT; Because they had no work for me.
"Mr. BLECKLY: But there are other people who want workmen. I sup-
pose it is because you are a bad workman that they could not find you work.
What does your wife do?
"APPLICANT: Nothing, Sir.
"Mr. BLECKLY: But there is plenty of work for women.
"Mr. BLECKLY: How many children have you.—Two. A boy going to
school, and a girl aged 18.
"Mr. BLECKLY: And what is the girl doing P
"APPLICANT: Nothing at present, Sir.
"Mr. BLECKLY: But what has she been doing all her life?
"APPLICANT: She has only been fit for work for this last two years, and
she has worked in the fields when she could.
"Mr. BLECKLY: Well, I think you are a lazy eet. What money did Mrs.
Ki LSI! ALL give you P
* APPLICANT: 18*. per week.
"Mr. W. PKNNINOTON: I '11 just tell you what my opinion is. No doubt
he has left Kilshall's because they wonted to drop bis w«ge«.
"APPLICANT: No Sir; that is not the reason. There was no work for me.
"Mr. W. PBNNHWITON: Oh, yes; that's your tale.
"Mr. BLBCKLY: It is a sin and a shame that he should confess his girl bos
less.
But ho did not say so. He says she worked in the
been brought up in idleness.
"Mr. WINSTANLEY:

"After the applicant had been subjected to considerable further badgering,
Mr. J. PENNINOTON offered him 2». per day to work «• his farm at Winwick,
and this the applicant gladly accepted."
The next case is werry instructive, as showin. the tevolooshunary

spirit as is nowadays at work in the werry Bords of Guardians
theirselves, and givin you some idea what Chairmen like Mr.
BLECKLY 'ave to struggle aginst.
"JOHN APPLETON, the next applicant, said he had been a labourer at
Cartwright's glass works.
"Mr. BLECKLY: Whut do you come here for, then? Why don't you go
and make crates P
"APPLICANT: Because there is no work, Sir.
"Mr. PENNINOTON: Well, we can't make work for you.
"Mr. BLECKLY: What family hare you f
"APPLICANT: One boy.
"Mr. BLECKLY: And what does he do?
"APPLICANT: He works at Whitecross, and gets 6». per week.
"Mr. BLECKLY: And you, his father, cannot get 6». per week?
"APPLICANT: No, Sir; I cannot get anything.
"Mr. BLECKLY: Then you must be a useless fellow. What does your
wife do?
"APPLICANT: She goes out sewing, but has had very little work this last
few months.
"Mr. BLECKLY: Then why does she not do something else, and not sit
idle at home? Why doe«Tt she go out charing? How is it you could not
keep your place at Cartwright's? I expect it is because you are a worthless
fellow.
"APPLICANT, who was shouted at by several Guardians at once, said he
had worked for Mr. C. H. CARTWRIOHT for twenty-seven years up to last
Christmas, when, in consequence of bad trade, he was stopped, and had only
worked thirteen weeks since then.
"Mr. WINSTANLEY ['Oh, don't I know the soft-'eaded, Boft-'earted sort
as makes Forochial Goverment a burden to the ratepayers and a cus to the
porper,'] who spoke with some feeling, in consequence of the manner in which
the poor man was browbeaten on all sides, said: I object to the poor man
being shouted at in this manner on all sides. [' 'Adn't the Board better take
off their 'ats to 'em—'] It is most disgraceful. I think you should take
into consideration the state of the country at the present moment, and the
fact that there are thousands of poor people out of employment. Mr. HORTON,
who sita beside me, states that he receives at least 200 applications a week
for work. It certainly is not our duty to abuse them when they come here
seeking for relief.
"Mr. BLECKLY: I hope Mr. WINSTANLEY does not think we abuse them,
but 1 mean to say that here is a man fifty-two years of age-with a wife forty-
two, and like many others he thinks he can <ome to the Workhouse and get
work when he has been thrown out of employment, as I have no doubt he
has through his own idleness. The Relieving Officer tells us that if the man
can get a la. a day ho will stop here all day and do nothing. And from his
own statement, if his wife can't get sewing she stops at home idle."
In course she do; that's her little game.
A dangerous party that WIXSTANLET. Wants keeping down;
wich BLECKLY'S evidently the man to do it. It's really refreshin to
see a Chairman, with seen a strong sense of his dooty to the rate-
payers, and sech a strong way of puttin on it, and droppin down
on them owdacious porpers. Comin nere as hold as brass to the Bord
to ask for bread. Give 'em stones, and 9d. a day for breaking on
'em; and let them be thankful they live in a Christian country;
as Mr. B. told JOHN D ALTON, who had the imperence to say he
had been in Warrington for twenty-nine years without needing
asssistance before.
"Mr. W. PENNINOTON: Give him 6rf. a day, and let him break stones.
"Mr. BLECKLY: We will give you 9rf. a day for breaking a certain
quantity of stones; and if you do not break that quantity, you will get so
much less.
"APPLICANT: Thank you, Sir.
"JOHN EOAN, sixty-four, labourer, with a wife, aged forty-eight, appeared
to ask that his money might be raised to 1*. a day, as lie had only been
getting 9rf. Applicant had one eye bandaged up, it having been cut open
with a blow from a stone which he was breaking.
"Mr. W. PENNINOTON: Oh, give the fellow 6<t. a day. It's quite plenty
for him."
I should think it was. A poor half-blind cretnr!
Arter the oases of relief was disposed of, the Chairman, still in
discharge of his dooty to the ratepayers, pinted out, as there was
this run on the stone-yard at 9<f. a day, that—
"The Board would have to consider the question of having fixed rules for the
men, and a fixed quantity of work for them to do. They would also have to
have a taskmaster such as they had in prisons, in order to see that the men
did the work and earned their money."
That's it, Mr. Punch, keep 'em at it, and see 'em at it. That's
the rule for the Borper, accordin to the experience of your obedient
servant, and their master—both of long standin'.

"Du tree noble etpuitiant Seigneur BENJAMIN, Comte de

and in the place it occupies, the name of BENJAMIN is a
novelty. And then it marks, besides an era, a date. The
day on which the Beaconsfield Arms were posted in St.
George's Chapel, was likewise that on which, under orders
from the Beaconsfield Government, Her Majesty's troops

to Cyprus, to remodel one of the native states of the
island.
Now, as we have no SOLON to send, we Bend instead
Colonel STANLEY and Mr. SMITH, the wise heads of the War
Office and the Admiralty, not to see if we have made a

whether there is any, and what, way out of it. What a

They know what to tell, and they know what to keep—

I was frightened at first; but I don't mind them now:
But the thing I don't like is my heart growing cold;
When my sisters come here, well, I just ask them how
They will have it— in twenties, or tens, or gold?
And I don't feel the least as I once used to feel;
Where my heart used to be there's a stone to tit!
And I watch them, poor dears, as if they might steal,
And they cry till they can't get the better of it.
But it's not'good for sleep, or for Sunday, or prayers,
To be always shovelling heaps of gold,
And always thinking of bills and shares,
And rigging the market to get shares sold.
It spoils the complexion, when blood and heart

DEAR Mr. PUNCH,
You often have a laugh~at us poor farmers, and we do like
our Punch, but I really don't think you half appreciate what a deal
of fun there is in farming. 'Tis such a paying business! We pay
all our calves, and all our milk and honey, and eggs and fowls, and
our little lambkins (and the big ones too) to our much-respected
landlords; and then, to our poor overworked labourers, and our dear
underworked paupers we pay all our wheat (the barley does nicely
for their beer); and as to oats, that is one of those few things we
don't always get a crop of; and if we don't, we have to pay for oats
for our poor dear gee-gees.
Really, Mr. Punch, if you don't come to the rescue very soon, we
shall only want one-wheeled waggons for this next harvest.
I want to show you a model agreement between a landlord and
tenant.—'Tis so funny.
Between SKINNER FLINT, Esq. and JEBEMIAH MANGOLDWUBZEL, i'C
is hereby agreed on their respective parts :—
1. That the tenant shall do everything that may be required on
the farm.
2. That the tenant shall have plenty of capital when he enters
on his occupation.
3. That the tenant shall pay his rent in advance.
4. That whatever the tenant lay out on cake and artificial
manures, he shall always be considered to be making at least
25 per cent, on his outlay.
5. That the tenant's wife and daughters shall milk the cows and
make the butter.
6. That the tenant shall sell no hay nor straw, and shall not
prow two straw crops in succession, as it upsets the rabbits'
ideas about the rotation of crops.
7. That the tenant shall not keep the new triplex cows which
bring three calves at a birth, nor the duplex ewes which
always twin, as this exhausts the land.
8. That if the tenant violate the aforesaid conditions, all the
extra calves and lambs shall be forfeit to the landlord.
9. That the tenant shall not be entitled to compensation for
damages from rabbits and game.
10. That the tenant shall have the right of purchasing, every
year, two full-grown rabbits, or twelve very little ones.
11. That the landlord shall allow the tenant the right of
grumbling, the landlord reserving to himself the right of
giving his tenant any indulgences he may think for his good.
Now, Mr. Punch, knowing what a deal of influence you possess
with our legislators (didn't you suggest the Agricultural Holdings
Act ?), I want you to persuade them into passing another Statute,
to be entitled. The Agricultural Losings Act." I should suggest
that all landlords, who have been taking their rents for the last
three years out of their tenants' capital, should forbear their rents
for the next eighteen months, and that at the end of that time
they and their tenants should sign a mutual agreement—
1. That no landlord shall in future take more rent than he
would be willing to pay if he were the tenant.
2. That the tenants will pay their labourers fair wages, and farm
the land well, or leave.
3. That any damages to either landlord's or tenant's interests be
fairly appraised and compensated.
I would suggest, finally, a permissive clause (it is in this, my
dear Punch, that I recognise special work for your inimitable
hand), to allow either party to get out of his bargain by giving six
months' notice.
I have been pulling so hard against the collar for a long time
THE POET (OF THE PERIOD).
Wilh Punch's apologies for the application of noble Slanzas to an
ignoble subject.
THE Poet in a dismal clime was born,
With lurid stars above;
Dower'd with a taste for hate, a love for scorn,
A scorn for love.
He glanced through life and death, through (food and ill,
He glanced through his own soul;
And found all dead as a dishonoured bill,
Or emptied bowl.
He thrummed his lay; with mincing feet he threaded
The walks of coterie fame:
On the dull arrows of his thought were threaded
Concetti tame.
And pop-gun pellets from his lisping tongue,
Erratic in their flight.
From studio to drawing-room he flung,
Filling with light
And mazed phantasies each morbid mind,
Which, albeit lacking wit,
Like dandelion seeds blown by the wind,
In weak souls lit,
Took shallow root, and springing up anew
Where'er they dropt, behold,
Like to the parent plant in semblance, grew
A weed as bold,
And fitly furnished all abroad to fling
Fresh mockeries of truth,
And throng with poisonous blooms the verdant Spring
Of weak-kneed youth.
Till many minds were lit with borrowed beams
Of an unwholesome tire j
And many fed their sick souls with hot dreams
Of vague desire.
Thus trash was multiplied on trash; the world
Like a Gehenna glowed,
And through the clouds of Stygian dark upcurled,
Foul radiance flowed;
And Licence lifted in that false sunrise
Her bold and brazen brow;
While Purity before her burning eyes
Melted like snow.
There was red blood upon her trailing robes,
Lit by those lurid skies;
And round the hollow circles of the globes
Of her hot eyes,
And on her robe's hem, "FOLLY" showed in flames
With " PHRENSY," names to shake
Coherency and sense—misleading names—
And when she spake,
Her words did gather fury as they ran,
And as mock lightning and stage thunder,
With firework flash and empty rataplan,
Make schoolboys wonder,
So thrilled thro' fools her windy words. No sword
Of truth her right hand twirl'd,
But one bad Poet's scrawl, and with his word
She bored the world.

TOYS AND THEIR TEACHING.
Lady Customer. "MY LITTLE BOY WISHES FOR A NOAH'S ARK. HAVE YOU ONE!"

CONSIDERED TOO DENOMINATIONAL, M'UM!"
ill-bred, I go straight up to the face I know, and say heartily, "Ah!
how are you?" He is in the middle of a discussion on the latest
news of the day with a tall, hazy-eyed man, with an eye-glass that
he can't fix for more than a second at a time, and whose expression
is something so between a laugh and a cry, as to convey the idea of
his having taken his wine before dinner, instead of having that
pleasure to come.
The gentleman, whom I recognise, stares at me. then exclaims.
"Ah! now are you!" in a surprised way, implying that, had
politeness permitted, he would have added, And who the deuce are
y°u?"
Then follows the usual stupid pause, and the usual nervous laugh.
We are both trying to remember where we saw each other last, and
what we know of one another, if anything.
"We discover, to our mutual relief, that there is no deception; that
we did meet at the SHALLUSES, about a year or so ago; which
leads us to inquire of one another what has become of the SHAL-
LT7SE8, as if they "d been hanged, or sold up, or transported in the
mean time. Neither of us knows what has become of the SHAL-
ursES; and here the conversation would come to a standstill, but
for the hazy-eyed man, who evidently resents my interruption, and
attracts my acquaintance's attention with, "By the way, ,HosH-
FOKD"—ah! that's his name, HOSHPOHD, of course—" I was going
to ask just now,"—which implies that he would have asked him, if
I hadn't come up, and interrupted,—"whether you ever got a satis-
factory reply from the Serjeant about the terms of the lease?"
This is so pointed a hint, as to their conversation up to the moment
I had " intervened "—like a Queen's Proctor—having been peculiarly
private and confidential, that I cannot avoid feeling myself " not in
it," and so turn away, hoping either that JOSSLYN will introduce
me to some one, or that dinner will be announced, or that there is a
photograph-book that I can examine.
I survey the company. Another face I recognise—a man whom
I 've seen, generally at luncheon-time, at the Club for years; never
ascertained his name, and never seen him speaking to any one. I
remember having been informed that this was a Country Member,
who lived some distance from town, and who apparently only came
up at luncheon-time, and then went back again. 1 doubted it
then; now, I believe it to be true. He advances towards me, and
observes, cheerfully, "I think we ought to know one another!"
I respond to the sentiment with much cordiality. At the same
time, I wonder if, after this, we shall do more than bow distantly
for the remainder of our lives, except when on another similar
occasion bringing us again together, we shall make the same remark.
I ask him if he knows many people here, which question implying
that he doesn't, rather depreciates the value of his friendly greet-
ing. He replies, "No; not everybody."
At this moment JOSSLYN DYKE comes up to me, and with an air of
the deepest mystery, says, "I want you to take Mrs. LAWLEIGH
BYHNE in to dinner."
Of course I reply, "that nothing I could possibly have im-
agined would give me greater pleasure than to take Mrs. LAWLEIGH
BYRNE in to dinner," and I look round to see which is Mrs. LAWLEIGH
BYRNE. There are two old Ladies by the fire chatting together;
one with a conspicuously false brown front, and the other with a
most festive cap; and I do hope that neither of these is Mrs. LAW-
LEIOH BYRNE.
JOSSLYN DYKE relieves my mind by saying, sadly—he generally
speaks sadly as though he were reluctantly fulfilling some painful
duty—
"You know her, don't you?"
"No, I don't think ."
He murmurs in my ear with melancholy emphasis,
1' Great beauty. Everybody about here been going mad after her.
Widow. Very rich. Very old county family. Come!"
I am overawed by this description, and almost begin to wish that
the introduction had been, after all. to one of those two old Ladies
by the fire,-^-even to the one in the festive cap.
I delay him for a moment to ask who all the people are. JOSSLYN
explains them to me as if they were catalogued figures in a wax-
work exhibition. "That old Gentleman there, talking to Mrs.
LAWLEIOH BYRNE, is Mr. RENDLESHAM of Pickley—very old county

family—the old Lady with a cap is Mrs. AYSFOBD SYNGE of The
Wick, near here, one of the oldest families in the county"—and il
occurs to me one of the oldest Ladies in the county too-^-" and," 1
ask, "the other funny old Lady with the "—I am just going to add,
"evident false front"—when ne interrupts me gravely. That is
my aunt, Mrs. TOTTON, who is staying here "—very glad I didn'l
say any more. He continues, "HOSIIFORD, you know.
''He'snot an old county family, is he?'" I ask, incredulously,
having hitherto only associated him with London.
"Yes, very old county familv. HOSHFORD came over with the
AYSFOHD SYNOES." I thought he was going to say "with the Con-
queror." "The tall man with the eye-glass is HENRY SANDILANDS,
a very old friend of mine." Glad I didn't venture on any personal
remark about him. "The thin elderly Gentleman with the bald
head is AYSFORU SYNGE, of The Wick—and the stout man he's
talking to is PELKIN WADD, an ex-master in Chancery."
I remark that I once knew a Wadd family in Sussex.
JOSSLYN resents this. I had evidently no business to know a
Wadd family in Sussex, who, apparently, were impostors, as these,
the PELKIN WADDS, have no relations anywhere out of this county—
in fact, never been out of Dampshire. It occurs to me that the
PELKIIT WADDS resemble the Christy Minstrels, who never perform out
of St. James's Hall,—and that ail the other WADDS are counterfeits.
I wonder what the other WADDS say to this? It appears that I am
among the representatives of all the oldest county families. Quite
a gathering of the Clans. JOSSLYN'S serious and impressive manner
seems to imply that he feels what a responsibility he nas incurred by
bringing together this valuable collection of old county families,
After going through the catalogue I almost expect him to add,
"Please not to touch the figures.
There is age upon them all except HOSHFORD and Mrs. LAWLF.IGH
BYRNI, the former looking younger than he really is (I 've known
him by sight for years), and the latter looking, it strikes me, older
than she really is; but still a Beauty.
A sudden shyness comes over me. But it is too late. I am led
up to Mrs. LAWLEIGD BYBNE. She is a fine, handsome, lustrous-
eyed lady in black velvet, much lace, and sparkling diamonds,
a naming crimson cap of satin all crumpled as if some one had been
sitting on it by accident, and white gloves, with about sixteen
buttons, up to her elbows.
She is seated, and still engaged in conversation with the Crusty
Klderly Gentleman,—RENDLESHAM of Pikley.
If there is one ceremony more awkward than another, it is that
of introduction to the person you are to take in to dinner. To
begin with: it's not the choice of either party; your host is the
providence for the occasion. Then you know nothing of one another;
you are utterly ignorant as to whether there is between you any
similarity of tastes, or some agreement of opinion. Perhaps one
may dislike everything the other fancies, and vice rersd. Then

is made responsible for his companion's enjoyment
remainder of the evening.
The introduction is completed, JOSSLYN DYKE (who is really one of
the gravest, and, ordinarily, one of the most sensible men in the
world) stupidly adding, on leaving us, as a recommendation of me
to her favour, " He '11 amuse you, Mrs. BYRNE," whereat The Beauty
slightly elevates her dark eyebrows, and brings to bear on me the
full power of her electric lustrous eyes, as though expecting to see
me do something to amuse her on the spot, there and then. Stand on
my head perhaps, or swallow a paper-knife and bring it out of my
right ear. I know men who can do this, and, conversation failing,
I envy them the accomplishment.
{Happy Thought.—Must learn tricks with cards. Carry a pack in
my pocket, and, on being introduced, come to business at once with
the question, "Take a card—look at it: you "re sure you '11 know it
again ?" &c. This would start a subject of conversation between
two utter strangers, and do away with all the wearisome twaddle
about the weather and the news.
However, as I haven't matured this plan, I can only protest feebly
against JOSSLYN DYKE'S remark. But he doesn't stay to listen to it.]
I would protest, but JOSSLYN DYKE has gone.
I can only smile, inanely. I am painfully conscious of the utter,
inanity of the smile, and say,
"Well, it rather"
But I don't get any further, as Old Crusty—I mean old RENTJLE-
STIAH of Pikley—resumes his conversation at the point where he
had dropped it, and Mrs. LAWLEIQH BYRNE turns her head towards
him and away from me, so that I can only stand before them and
listen to what they have to say to one another, which is all about
their county matters, which, as I am utterly ignorant on tho subject,
have no sort of interest for me. I don't like to go away. I don't
like to stop. If there were a chair at hand, sitting down would give
me some occupation.
I am nervously aware of Mrs. LATVLEIGH BYRNE'S observing me
out of the corner of her eye. Perhaps at this moment I am fulfilling
my mission, and amusing her. I wish Old Crusty would retire.
The announcement of dinner breaks up the groups, and I have to
offer my arm to Mrs. LAWLEIGH BYRNE.
Which arm F
[Happy Tlwught.—Watch my host, JOSSLYN DYXE/and see which
arm he gives.]
I could have sworn I saw him give his right arm. I give mine.
Immediately afterwards I find I am the only person who has given
his right arm. Perhaps giving the left arm is one of the ancient
customs of the oldest county families. I apologise. Shall we
change? Mrs. LAWLEIGH BTRKE appears a little annoyed at the
awkwardness. Our changing arms involves a delay of the procession,
which is arranged on some principle of county precedence, which in
my ignorance I violate by stepping gaily before old PELKIN WADD,
the ex-Master of Chancery, with Mrs. TUPTON, JOSSLYN'S false-
fronted Aunt, on his arm.
Mrs. LAWLEIGH BYKNE says, seriously, in an undertone to me,
"They '11 never forgive me for this. We 're out of our place."
I try to reassure her by replying cheerfully that '' we shall soon
be in our right place," meaning at dinner, but she evidently regards
this as levity, and the procession moves, silently and solemnly, into
the dining-room, where for a time, but only for a time, the gloom of
the Mote would have entirely disappeared, but for the sombre pic-
light into the dark bogie corners of this old Elizabethan dining
room,—and but for, above all, the presence of GOOL, the Phantom
Butler, and his carefully-selected band of Old County Waiters.

"UNE CAUSE CELEBRE."
PENNY WHIZZLEB, A. A. A. (Anglo-American Artist] v.. KITBSKTN
(High-Art Critic].
(Tried before Baron PUZZLETON and a Special Jury.)
SR.HJE.urr THBUST and learned Juniors for the Plaintiff; Sir JOHIS
JOKER, (i.C., and other learned Counsel for the defence.
Scene—Court full of pictures, principally PENNY WHIZZLER'S, who
has also got a roomfull on view at an hotel in the neighbourhood
In fact, it is quite a little holiday for PENNY WHUZLER, who is in
great feather, which appears, as an arrangement in white, on the
top of his forehead; though in attacking the great Critic. Mr. llrn-
SKDT, the Anglo-American Artist cannot be said to have "displayec
the white feather."
Our Reporter, as usual, did not arrive until the middle of the
trial, and the following is his condensed report:—•
Sir John Joker, Q.C. (cross-examining Mr. PENNY WHIZZLEE,
A.A.A.). And I dare say you thought that with one of these Noc-
turnes you would Knock Turner out of the field? (Chuckles from
Juniors; smiles from Jurymen; laughter of Spectators; gravity
from the Judge, who does not approve of any jokes being laughed at
except his own. On order being restored, Sir J. J. resumes.) And
one of these Nocturnes,—you knock 'dt 'urn off in two hours, eh?
(Great laughter, except from Judge, who suddenly remembers a
real good story, that wiu make them all roar,—he will watch his
opportunity.) And for two hours' work you ask two hundred pounds?
Penny Whizzler (gloriously, with a true American touch a la
BABNTTM). No; Sir.' I ask two hundred dollars—I mean pounds—
for the Experience of a Life Time!!
[Immense applause. The Judge, still waiting for his opportu-
nity to tell his good story, and not yet seeing it, suppresses
the unseemly exhibition of feeling.
Sir John Joker, Now. I'll ask you about this. (Points to a
picture—one of PENNY WHIZZLEB'S.) What is this meant for?
Serjeant Tnrust (speaking up for his client.) I dare say Mr.
WHIZZLEE will .be able to inform yon, if ho stands on his head, as
you 've got that picture upside down.
[Roars of laughter. The Judge fancies at first that he sees the
opportunity for his good story. But as he is making up his
mind, he is interrupted by the answer of the Plaintiff.
Penny Whizzler (to his Counsel). No, I beg your pardon, Sir;
it's all right. It's not upside down.
[More laughter, in which Serjeant THBTTST joins.
Sir John Joker. Well, it doesn't much matter. The picture—
that is, the painting—would be much the same in any position.
What is it ?—a bridge, an elephant, or a telescope P
[Shouts of laughter. Jtidge 'leans back, and sees, with regret,
the chances of bringing in his good story grotcing fainter and
fainter. He determines to lug it in somehow.
Penny Whizzler. Well, Sir, if you were the lucky purchaser, I
should say, "It's whatever you like, my little dear. You pays
your money, and you takes your choice."
[Great laughter, suppressed by the Judge, who sees that every-
body will be exhausted before he can get his good story
out; during which the Plaintiff leaves the box.
Mr. Sang Brown (examined by Serjeant THRUST). I am an artist,
a remarkable artist. Yes; that is my opinion. I think Mr. PENNY
WHIZZLEH'S pictures want finish.
Sir John Joker (half arid*). Yes, the sooner he puts the finish to
them the better.
[Titter. Serjeant THHUST regards Sir JOHN indignantly, and
the Judge wonders if the time for his good story has at last
arrived.
Serjeant Thrust (alluditig to a Picture, by an Old Master, in
Court). This is TITIAN'S Pioture of—of—of—(Referi to his brief)—
ah! yes, of ANDBEW GATTI.
Baron Puzzleton. GATTI—GATTI—let me see!
[Thinks he has heard the name before, and refers to his notes.
Wonders whether THIS is the opportunity for his story.
Serjeant Thrust (who has been, in the meantime, further instructed
by Solicitor). No, my Lord, not GATTI, but GEITTI—Doge GRITTI.
[The Picture, however, was. after all, described in one newspap
report as "o/ANDEE GATTI,"—the Reporter being dehghti
to do a turn to the well-known Restaurant.
<er
'ted
Sir John Joker. Doge Gritti.' Are you quite sure it's not a
picture of "Little Sandy" f
Penny Whizzler (from his seat). No, Sir, it's a genuiHe paintin'
—it's GMTTI. In fact, it's the " true gritti."
[Laughter from admiring friends—when, suddenly, the Judge
sees his way to the good story.
Baron Puzzteton. I don't want to snake anyone laugh—(Everyone
prepares for a grin)—but I remember a story of some one who
bought a picture as a genuine Titian (grin on [all features becoming
more and more marked), and when he came to examine it through
his glasses—I must tell you ,he was an Op-tttian—(shouts—Ushers
in fits)—he found [out that onlyi half of it was by TITIAN; so he
stuck it up as a screen, and made it into a Part-tittan.'
[Roars. Jurymen in ecstasies, punching one another in th.
ribs. Ecstasies. Ushers rolling on the ground. Police-
man runs out of Court into Westminster Hull, to tell it to a
friend outside. Uuriny this scene nf uproarious hilarity our
Reporter adjourned for lunch, and only returned to hear the
last part of the summing up.
Learned Baron Puzzleton. No doubt the eminent critic, Mr.
IluDSKlsr, was quite right in his opinion, but wrong in his way of
expressing it. If there be any truth in the old adage, "Ars eat
celare artem," then Mr. PENNY WHIZZLEB is a great artist, as he
has thoroughly succeeded in concealing his art. Yet this is no
reason why he should be called a " Cockney coxcomb." Mr. PENNY
WHIZZLEK should rather thank Mr. UUBSKIN for having given him
such an opportunity, as this has been, for informing the general
public of his existence, of which the general public was probably
not aware. However, it is for vou, Gentlemen of the Jury, to
decide whether the Plaintiff has been damaged by the Defendant,
or not.
The Jury found that the Defendant had done exactly one farthing's
damage to the Plaintiff.
Baron Puzzleton. That, Gentlemen, is your verdict, and a very
good one, too. We have all to thank Mr. PENNY WHIZZLER for an
exceedingly pleasant couple of mornings in Court; and henceforth,
instead of being called Mr. PENNY WHIZZLER, he will have three-
fourths taken off his name, and be known as Mr. FAHTHINO
WHIZZLER.
[More laughter; during which the Judge bows to everyone, and
retires gracefully. End of Scene in Court.
WHAT SUNDAY-CLOSING DOES FOE DUBLIN.
THE following Times paragraph may be
regarded as an illustration of the
effect of that paternal enactment:—
"THE IRISH SUNDAY CLOSING ACT.—Our
Dublin Correspondent writes under date
NOT. 25 :—' The arrests for drunkenness in
Dublin between 7 A M. on Saturday and 2 P.M.
on Sunday for the forty weeks from June, 1877,
to March, 1878, numbered, 4332, the average
of each batch of arrests being 108. The arrests
for drunkenness between the corresponding
hours during the five weeks following on the
coming of the Sunday Closing Act into opera-
tion were 685, the average of each batch of
arrests being 137."
These results appear to rather more
than warrant the conclusion that:—
"Up to the present, therefore, the Sunday
closing Act in Dublin does not seem to have
Y'''e diminished the amount of drink consumed,
although it has certainly been productive of
the best results in the orderly condition of
he itreets on Sunday evenings."
The Sunday Closing Act in Dublin seems, instead of diminishing,
jo have notably increased the amount of drink consumed; if increase
n drinking may be held to bear any proportion to increase of arrests
or drunkenness. How, then, to account for the orderly condition
>f the streets on Sunday evenings? Perhaps, by the supposition that
he tippling classes, for their Sunday's consumption, have generally
aid in a store of whiskey, which, unlike beer, will keep in a bottle;
hat they stay at home drinking all day, and by the time that
Sunday evening has come, are most of them a great deal too tight
x> turn out of their houses. Apparently, therefore, the Irish Sunday
Closing Act for the prevention of intemperance is answering its
purpose in a truly Irish manner. Only the Teetotallers keep on
elling us that drunkenness is also increasing in England. That, if
a fact, has also followed the enactment of a statute partly closing
;averns and restaurants on Sundays. What an argument on behalf
f the agitation for closing them altogether!

So scornful of " chatter," so hard on " frivolity,"
With the reticent jubilance he means for jollity—
"In spite of all bothers from LAWRENCE and others,

Then said CROSS, at cross purpose, for once, -with his Chief,

Let the meeting be early, e'en if it be brief.
For a vote of the House would be such a relief,
And to miss it a blunder, much worse than a crime."
Quoth NORTIICOTE, "I judge it with eye to the Budget,

RAILWAY ECONOMY.
A MOHNING contemporary publishes the alarming announcement
of a
"REDUCTION OF RAILWAY SERVANTS' WADES.—The Midland Railway
Company has given notice to their station porters of a reduction amounting
to a shilling a week after the 18th of December. The Manchester, Sheffield,
and Lincoln Railway servants hare been reduced, that reduction taking effect
for the first time on Saturday last. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway
have just also reduced the wages of their porters and other servants. It is
rumoured also that a reduction will follow in the servants of all grades."
And what may be expected to follow those reductions of the
wages of Railway Servants, already overworked and underpaid?
Corresponding^ reduction, probably, of care and attention to duty on
their part, and of adequate skill and ability on that of those engaged
to succeed them. Proportionate multiplication of Railway collisions
and other accidents, and numbers of passengers killed and wounded,
also possibly of actions for compensation brought against Railway
Companies, and payments of damages which they will have incurred
by reducing their servants' wages. If, as is to be hoped, the amount
they lose through that reduction should very far exceed all that they
gain by it, they will perhaps discover that they have been repaid, as
they deserved, for an unwise as well as ungenerous economy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BAD NEWS FOR DOCTORS.
EXSIULE Reform, indeed, my
dear Dr. ROSELEAF! Here 'a
a pretty piece of news! It
nearly took my breath away,
and destroyed my appetite
for breakfast :—
"It is currently Wported that
many Ladies in the higruat circles
of Socict)* are resolved, tlirough-
out the winter, to wear high
evening dresses. J)oubtiess their
example will, ere long, be widely
followed."
I am sure you must agree
with me in hating sense and
its itch for reforming evils
much better let alone. That
is quite opposed to profes-
sional interest. We fashion-
able doctors get our living
in great measure by the
follies of the fashion. Low
dresses especially are of the
very greatest service to us.
If Ladies are to take to cloth-
ing themselves properly when

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(At Drurrj Lane—The Jealous Wife—lielphcgor—Reminiscences—
Carmen at Her Majesty's—Novelties ahead—and no more at
present.)
Slit,—What hearty laughter at The Jealous Wife—the present
version might be called Essence of COLEMAN'S Compressed Comedy—
which, I should say, has for .two or three weeks past been the at-
traction at Drury Lane far more than Jielphegor, The Mountebank—
and I hope that the Mounte-bank will declare a dividend in these
times, when Scotch-banking is not quite so profitable as Mounte-
banking. As Mrs. Oakely, Mrs. HERMANN VEZIN is admirable, but
the house is far too large for the comedy, and they all have to |roar
at one another, not at all like sucking doves, but as though the entire
Dramatis Persona; were deaf.
Belphegor is worth seeing, if only for the sake of Mr. COWTER as
the wicked Duke, with the blackest lines of villany on his face.
He is very funny.
I have heard Carmen—for the first time, and I sincerely hope not
for the last. Of course, everyone tells me I ought to have seen
MINNIE HAUK in it instead of TRKBELLI; but as Madame TREBELLI
happened to be playing the part the night I was there, how the
impossible could 1 see Mdlle. MINNIE HAUK? I couldn't sing to her,
by private wire,
"MINNIE, dear MINNIE,
Come o'er the sea;
For I won't take a stall,
But I '11 stand in the hall,
And, my MINNIE, I 'm waiting for thee."
At least I could sing to her by telephone, only my singing would be
more expensive than her own; and then, like the spirits from the
nasty deep—" nasty "more correct reading than " vasty "—see old
folio—(who's Old Folio ?—good name for a bookworm in a farce)—
would she come when I did call? I don't think so. But when
MINNIE HAUK sang, stalls were at the Season prices, and now they
are only twelve-ana-sixpence each. And so,
"Rather less ' swelly'
I'll hear my TKEBELLI,
And seven-and-sixpenee I '11 save from a guinea
By hearing TIIEBELM instead of Miss MINNIE."
Her Majesty's was crammed, as I am informed it always is when
GEORGES BIZET'S Carmen is given. In fact, Tuesdays and Fridays
are the Jiizct-ist nights.
And are we not a musical people? Yes, we are; at all events,
those were at Her Majesty's the other night, for they never applauded
anybody, whoever they might be, who went—like things in the City
are so often said to go—that is, a little flat.
2 propos of " flat," I know a Composer residing in Albert Man-
sions, Victoria Street, Westminster, who lives in one flat! and how,
thus fettered, he can ever look sharp when he is requested to do so
by some one m a hurry, I don't know. Which would be the better
property—a tune or a Mansion in five flats? You can let out both
of them. I refer this important question to the Music Publishing
Company, with whom, a propos of Carmen, I have a bone to pick.
Cut bono f for the public weal.
This is the bone. I do complain that sufficient care is not taken
to see that the books supplied are correct. I may be an unlucky
exception, and my book may have been the only example of the kind
that nas happened for months. Yet it is an instance of what has
happened to mel and what, therefore, may happen to any one. So
let every intending purchaser of a book of the words examine the
pages to see that their numbers come in proper sequence, as, if they
do not, the happy possessor of the book will be driven wild, as I
was, by finding himself, while carefully following Act II., suddenly
Elunged into the middle of Act III., and then, having just recovered
rom that shock, to be utterly staggered again by finding the finale
of the Fourth Act in the middle of the Third. The pages of my
book were right from 1 to 14, when suddenly I found the dialogue
utterly inconsequent, and on looking at the number of the page
there was No. 19 as the sequence to 14. After a deal of searching I
found page 15 after page 22, and then getting clear away with the
story up to page 18, was suddenly confronted by the commencement
of Act the Fourth at page 27, the Third on the stage then being
in full swing. From 27 to 30 the book was sane enough, then it had
a fit—next to 30 came page 23, which went on right enough to
page 26, when the end of the Third Act was followed by the adver-
tisements.
I warn my readers, therefore, to examine their books before
buying, or, though they may obtain redress from the civil attendant,
who was ready enough to substitute a correct card for the incor-
rect one, and who, indeed, would have given me a new one (seeing
that I was unwilling to part with my copy, on which I had made
pencil notes) had it not been for a respectable elderly and crabbed
official, who, in a sort of Dogberry manner, kindly consented to
examine my book through his glasses, and then, finding my state-
ment correct, graciously deigned to inform me that "it was only
wrongly stitched," making no sort of offer of reparation, nor even
Solitely regretting the accidental circumstance, as he might have
one, and, in fact, giving me, by his manner, to understand how
utterly astonished he was at any visitor to Her Majesty's Theatre
venturing to utter a complaint about anything in his official depart-
ment—whatever that might be.
I mention this because a stitch in time saves nine, which is for the
benefit of the purveyors of the books, for the advantage of the public,
and for the good of the charming old person in the lobby, by whose
courtesy and politeness I was so favourably impressed.
Of course, the thine in Carmen is the Bullfighter's song, and
after that, I suppose, the Soprano's in the Third Act. That Spanish
uniform, with its English policeman's helmet, its French red
trousers, and its biliously-yellow coat, is a very trying costume for a
tenor-lover to be put into. I was glad, for his sake, when he had
deserted, and gone in. with Carmen, for "the days when we went
gipsying" in the Third Act.
The story of Carmen, or the New Bohemian Girl, slight as it is,
affords plenty of opportunity for picturesque groupings, costumes,
varied choruses, and an effective ballet. The opera commences at
7'30, and is over by eleven—a great advantage to most people; as is
also the Opera Colonnade, which gives everyone a fair chance, after
leaving Carmen, of getting easily at Cabmen.
At one of the theatres is to be produced an Opera Buffa by Signor
BUCAIOSSI. As far as the name of the composer goes, absit omen,
as Book-a-loss-i sounds unlucky.
Having crowded myself out of speaking of Fra Diavolo at the
Gaiety, the revivals at the Folly, and the last moments of the ex-
piring Pink Dominos (chief mourners, Messrs. CHARLES WYNBHAJI
& Co., and Lord HERTFORD and Mr. EDWARD PIGOTT in the second
carriage, when the naughty play is re-hearsed for the last time);—and
The Crisis—another adaptation—bless it!—this time from SAR-
BOTT'S—SARDOTJ again—bless him! — Les Fourchambaults, by the
eminent adapter of Les Dominos Roses, not having yet appeared at
the Haymarket, nor The Shadow of Number Twenty's Fate (an
original work this time by Messrs. HATTON AND ALBERT,—it takes
two of 'em to be original) at the Princess's, I have nothing more to
say except to contradict the reports of a hostile encounter (a la MM.
GAMBETTA AND FOTJRTOTJ), between Mr. ARTHUR STIRLING, the
Lazare in Proof, which Jhas reached its 200th night, at the Adelphi,
and Mr. G. W. ANSON, the Lazare in Over Proof at the Royalty,
and with this information, which is "very necessary for these
times," I conclude, and sign myself, now as always,
Youit REPRESENTATIVE.

MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
You have been called together at this earljr date because the
peace secured with so much honour a few months since has ended in
war.
It is unnecessary to state that it was always my intention to
summon Parliament, not to discuss the policy of commencing hos-
tilities against the Ameer of AFGHANISTAN, which is my business
and not yours, but to obtain the money which has been, and will be,
spent for these hostilities, for which my Government have long been
preparing. My Government will assure you, as they have assured
me, that they wish Parliament to strengthen their hands and fill
their pockets. I have no doubt that you will believe them, and that
you will regard the expressions of opinion out of doors with the same
calm indifference with which it has oeen received by my Ministers.
GENTLEMEN OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,
MY Government have taken steps to secure a Scientific
Frontier. You will, I doubt not, see your way to granting the
supplies required to defray the expense of the Rectification of
territory thus rendered necessary. The Bills for that purpose
will be laid before you.
MY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,
I FEEL assured that after you have disposed of the Bills
which will be submitted for your acceptance, my Government will
be able to return to their homes in a state of mind enabling them
to enjoy a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
And now I bid you a brief farewell, wnich will be renewed for a
longer period when I dismiss you for the Christmas holidays.

Gardener. "SHUHE, YER HONOUR, WID A PINT OF IT IN THE HOUSE—SALED rr—I'D NIVER GET A WINK o' SLEEP!"
SOMETHING LIKE A DUEL!
(Translated from the French.)
THE following is a detailed and exact narrative of the affair of
honour at which MM. 1'Avocat PATELIN and the honourable Deputy,
PATAPOUF, assisted as principals. We who sign this paper were the
seconds of these Gentlemen :—
M. le Depute PATAPOUF, in the course of a speech delivered before
the Assembly, found it necessary to declare that "black was
white." M. 1'Avocat PATELIN denied the accuracy of this assertion.
Upon being requested by M. le PRESIDENT OF THE ASSEMBLY to with-
draw this denial, M. PATELIN expressed his unwillingness to do
so until M. PATAPOUF had in some degree altered his definition. He
moreover alluded to M. PATAPOUF as "the individual who has recently
spoken." M. le President having explained that the terms of his
denial were unparliamentary, M. 1'Avocat proceeded to a modification
of it, adding that probably M. le Depute was under the* impres-
sion that both black and white were grey," and that consequently
his statement was "colourably .true." At this point the incident
in the Assembly ended.
Subsequently, M. PATAPOUF, after mature deliberation, on having
arrived at the conclusion that M. PATELIN'S explanation was not
altogether satisfactory, requested two of the Signataries of this
piper, MM. de la GARROTTE and de la BLAGUE, to sound M. PATELIN
upon the subject. M. PATELIN persisted in the assertion that some
people might consider black a different colour from white. Upon
this a hostile meeting became absolutely a matter of necessity.
After some negotiations, M. PATELIN nominated M. lo Comte
DE L'EAU SCORE ET DE L'ABSLNTHE, to represent him. The nomi-
nation was accepted.
The Signataries of this paper having now the management of this
incident in their own hands, drew out the following programme :—
1. The principals to fire one shot at one another at eighty
paces distance, with pistols of the cavalry pattern of the
First Empire.
2. The incident to be closed with the discharge of the weapons.
This programme was submitted to MM. PATELIN and PATAPOUT,
who unconditionally accepted it. A further suggestion that the pistols
should only be loaded with blank-cartridge (emanating from both the
principals), was peremptorily overruled by all the Signataries, who,
however, added the following article :—
3. That in consideration of the distance of the principals from
one another, and the possible deviation of the bullets from
the line of sight, each second may wear a suit of shot-
proof underclothing, and shall be allowed to retire behind an
earthwork rising five feet from the level of the ground.
These preliminaries having been arranged, the meeting took place
on the Belgian frontier. One shot was tired, having for result the
death of a cock-pheasant, which had taken up a position for ob-
serving the proceedings on a distant tree.
The Signataries of this paper hereby declare:—
1. That M. le Depute PATAPOUF was right in his assertion
that "black was white."
2. That M. 1'Avocat PATELIN was equally right in declaring
that the statement in its nudity was open to question.
3. That the meeting which has taken place between MM. PATA-
POUF and PATELIX was conducted according to the strictest
rules of such encounters.
4. That not the slightest stain rests upon the honour of either
M. PATAPOUF or M. PATELIN.
After the duel the principals and the seconds breakfasted to-
gether. The cock-pheasant was carved by.'M. le Docteur FKACASSE,
who had kindly volunteered his services in the event of any deplor-
able casualty.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PIOUS CHANCELLOR'S CREED.
(Poat-prtmduilly formulated iy the Prince yon B. himself, found in a liitseh, and to be taken, perluips, with a grain of Salt.)
I DO believe in Providence,
On grounds most firm and valid;
Its rulings have shown strength and sense,
And with my views have tallied.
"Tis ever on the stronger side,
And while my side s the stronger,
I shall acknowledge it with pride.
(But not a moment longer!)
I hold to Faith robust and stout,
And, Heaven and I agreeing,
All duffers who presume to doubt,
Deserve eternal d ing.
I 'm sole exponent of the truth,
Of genuine Christianity,
Cleared from all cant of love and ruth,
And humbug of humanity.
I do believe in days and dates,
As I 'm a (sort of) sinner j
I hold those fools defy the tatcs,
Who sit thirteen at dinner.
That Friday ventures badly fare,
For reasons past explaining;
That he 's an ass who has his hair
Cut when the moon is waning.
I do believe most men are fools,
And need despotic ruling
By one past-master in the schools
Of force and clever fooling;
That dangers which beset the State,
And risks that kings environ,
Demand a will as stern as Fate,
A rule of blood and iron.
I do believe in subtle skill
Disguised as brutal frankness,
And the display of ruthless will
In rowdy rci'fer-rankness.
As well shirk shedding blood for fear
Of staining God's pure daisies,
As strive to rule this lower sphere
By sentimental phrases.
I hold the great Germanic race
Is Heaven's favourite bantling,
Supreme in virile power and gruce,
And breadth of moral scantling.
That Franks are hounds, their women pigs,—
Gr-r-r! I the vain vile vermin hate!
I 'd squelch them—but for pap-soul'd prigs
Who funk the word " exterminate."
I do believe free Parliament
Means dawdling, drivelling, doting-,
Save only when it is content
With silent money-voting.
I hold, of all pretenders crass
Who ever claime'd dominion,
The worst is that gregarious ass
Nicknamed " Public Opinion."
I do believe the fittest head,
To shape and sway the nations,
Is one which has no need to dread
Competitive potations.
Latin is humbug, Greek is rot,
And Science a small matter.
Faustrecht thrives best on a full pot
And a well-loaded platter.
In fine, I do believe in Force
(Of fight, or faith, or feeding)
Uncramped by conscience, ruth, remorse,
Good-nature or good-breeding.
That Strength shouid sway in council, fraj',
Love, piety, or potting,
Is Providence s special way,
And Heaven's own allotting.

I* PUNCH,
•*-* WITH your
habitual omnisci-
ence you have doubt-
less observed that
the human race is
nowadays no less
firida novitatis than
it was in those
classic ages when
its greediness was
thus embodied in an
aphorism. This
greed for news is
_..-.-. possibly the reason
'£.'- why there are so
many newspapers
afloat, and why
some of them at any
rate strive to save
themselves from
sinking by not
being too particu-
lar as to what they
print. News is an
elastic word, and
may be stretched to well-nigh an indefinite extent; and r.ditors
who are not troubled with a conscience need not be careful as to
what they print, so long, at least, as they keep on the blind side of
the law.
Clubs were formerly considered to be strictly private places,
where Gentlemen might meet as in their own houses, without appre-
hension that confidence would be betrayed, or privacy violated. Some
old fogies may imagine that the strictly private acts of men in
private life arc hardly fair subjects for public comment. I myself,
perhaps, might own, in a weak moment, to such squeamishncss—
or delicacy, if you like the word better. But I am too poor to
indulge in such luxuries.
Putting delicacy aside, therefore, and coming straight to business,
I propose to start a journal whose pages shall be devoted entirely to
chronicling and commenting upon the private arts, words, and looks,
of private people. Clubs will be in my hands simply weapons of
offence: and I shall use them to hit right and left, no matter who
may suffer. To add to the attraction of my journal, scandal of all
sorts will be freely admitted to my columns, and abundant space
reserved for nasty personal remarks. Insinuations and inuendoes
will bo specially encouraged, and prominently placed. Hints at
trickery at cards will bo plentifully sprinkled in my "Whispers
from trie West," and the most transparent pseudonyms will indicate
the persons thus publicly attacked. Family quarrels will be faith-
fully recorded free of charge, and flirtations divulged with the

briefest possible delay. The gossip of the green-room will be made
a special feature, and anecdotes of actresses will be carefully
invented for the purpose of supplying lovers of fast life wild
amusing subjects of small talk. Angry correspondents will be thank-
fully encouraged to continue their disputes; and a sub-editor of
small stature will attend in the office to be kicked by any person
who is willing to pay for the privilege of committing an assault. In
short, no pains will be spared to make my journal talked about, and
to bring it into general contempt and disrepute. I hope thus 1o
secure for it the largest possible, if not, perhaps, quite a world-wide,
circulation, and if I can only manage to get a few good actions for
libel brought against my publisher, I expect to make my fortune, or,
at least, to keep my carriage, before the year is out.
For the present, I refrain from publishing my real name, which
hereafter may bo famous, and am content to sign myself,

TESTING THE THAMES.
Father Thames loquitur:—
V

ii v will they say my stream is liko
a sink,
And swear my bed is but a miry
TT ogp'
How dare maligners say my normal stink
Is as a " blend" of bilge-water and fog P
Such groundless accusation sorely irks
My friends the Metropolitan Board of Works.
That noble brotherhood they took a boat,
They also donned their best rose-coloured specs,
And down my libelled stream did steam and float,
With watchful eyes, tense noses, craning necks
(And goodly store of water of Cologne),
All to inspect my fragrant " sewage zone."
They sampled, tested, smelt; they stirred and poked,
With pole and eke with grapnel, bed and bank:
Theysnirfed and sipped, but, thoughthey smiled andjokcd
I noticed that but slender draughts they drank.
And then they found—I own to my surprise—
All those vile charges were but wicked lies.
There was no mud at all nor any muck,
. No nasty taste, and no unpleasant smell;
Nought unto lowered pole or grapnel' stuck,
Save harmless stone or shingle; all was well!
There might have been a little tarry scum,
But, for the rest, 'twas all a foolish hum.
Those beastly Gas-works were alone to blame,—
The sewage really improved my stream;
It was, they swore, a most outrageous shame,
That fools of silting up should talk or dream,
Or hint the presence —(evil-minded men)—
Of slime or sulphuretted hydrogen.
That people plunged in my pellucid flood
Should, owing to the sewage, faint or choke—
As some who 'd tried declared—was quite too good,
A really rare rib-cracking sort of joke.
Facing such facts, it was not fair, now was it?
To talk of filthy smell and foul deposit!
For just where that ill-fated Princess Alice
Had sunk, the stream was pure, the bottom shingle.
Tis very hard that such mendacious malice
With opposition's celd remarks should mingle!
Where do they hope to go to, those false divers?
Or those—(they said so)—".sewage-soaked" survivors?
They turned them back, vowing 'twas mere stupidity
Or nasty spite that had maligned me so.
y dimpling stream was guiltless of turbidity,
No filth befouled my water's silvery flow,—
Which undisputed facts," they cried with glee,
'Will.floor that odious Thames Conservancy!"
looray! And yet, and yet I somehow think
I 'm scarce convinced,—the world, I know, is not.
When Hercules of Alpheus made a sink,
To prate about improvement had been rot.
Still, still, a haunting doubt within me lurks,
bravely optimistic Board of Works!
A NOBLE EXAMPLE.
(Set Out Dramatically—For the Co-operative.)
SCENE—Interior of a Nobleman's Mansion near the Central Meat-
Market. Enter a Peer, his Daughter HONORIA, and AUGUSTUS.
PEER. Well, young man, you have had the advantages of an
Eton education, hold a Commission in the Guards, and belong to
ive respectable Clubs. But the suitor who claims HOXORIA'S hand
nust give surer pledges for her future happiness than this. (Sternly.)
Tell me, now, what do you know of butchers' meat f
Honoria (fondling him}. Oh! everything, Papa, dear. AUGUSTUS
would never have asked your consent until prepared to face and
;riumph over life with all its financial difficulties. He is quite
reformed.
Augustus. Indeed, I am. Sir. Since I have won your daughter's
jriceless love, gambling, the pleasures of the race-course, and meat
lirect from the butchers, have all been abandoned by me without a
nurmur. Henceforth I will deal with no middleman, and live but
'or her!
Peer. The resolution does you credit, but will you have the cou-
rage to act up to it? Remember, if you are an honourable man,
domestic existence will present some stumbling-blocks to you in its
very outset. I shall expect HONORIA'S husband to go himself early
o the central emporium and select and carry off a whole quarter,
lay, a whole side of the best beast that he can procure for good,
lonest, money.
Honoria (with enthusiasm}. He will do all this, dear, dear Papa!
Augustus. Ay, that 1 will, all this—and more. Twice in the
week will I run down, by some cheap slow night-train, to the
western counties, and myself see, bargain for, and bring up to
own—a living beast, perhaps a couple! There will be plenty of room
or them in the little garden at the back of our new house in Wilton
YOI.'fcXXT. A A
Place; and once having got them safely through the hall—wo can
kill on the premises ourselves!
Honoria. Dear, noble AUGUSTUS! How happy we shall be!
Peer. Well, there, my boy—take her! (He joins their hands.}
With such resolves to avoid the pitfall of wasteful expenditure, you
may be able to lead a cottage life on £5000 a year. But, bear in
mind, should you ever, in a weak moment, be tempted to let the
butcher's fatal cart stop before your door, that though your old
father-in-law lives at Smithfield, and gives tinned beef in sand-
wiches to his guests at evening parties, he saves twopence in the
pound all the year round, and sets a noble example.

To a House empty of Lords, and

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A BIT FROM BUXTON.
Mr. Blades, from Sheffield (affably to Noble Lard wUh the hereditary gout). "'OPE TOUR LORDSHIP'S BETTER THIS MORNING.
JUST MANAGE TO 'OP ABOUT A BIT"
Noble Lord (severely). "Aw—I WAS NOT AWARE THAT PEOPLE OP TOUR CLASS WERE SUBJECT TO MT COMPLATHT!"
I CAX
We 're bound by law to tell you tins, and an we must him; supplies,
The sooner you find them for us, the sooner you can rise.
Apropoi of the Berlin Treaty—there's no reason to be dejected;
It '• going on, like everything clue, as well as can be expected.
Of the Bills to be pawed—not those to be paid—we '11 apeak when you 've cut
and oome again;
And we wish you a Merry Christmas when you 've all got safe home again."
The first night's dehate in the Lords was like a COOK'S tour—
"personally conducted."
It turned—not on the policy of the Government in making war on
Afghanistan—but on the candour of Lord CRANBROOK'S Despatch,
and the veracity of Lord SALISBURY'S assurance—"miserable per-
sonalities," as both Lord SALISBURY and Lord BEACONSFEELD called
them. As a matter of course, Lord GRANVILLE put these unplea-
sant charges as pleasantly as possible; and equally, as a matter of
course, Lord CBANBBOOK repelled the imputation ag-ainst him with
heat, and Lord SALISBURY with haughty aggressiveness.
This is a matter, however, which chiefly interests the noble Lords
personally concerned—Lord NORTHBROOK, who protests against the
colour given by Lord CRANBROOK'S ninth paragraph to his Govern-
ment's action in 1873—Lord CRANBROOK, who declares he has given
the true colour in the paragraph, and is ready to lay on another coat
of it—the Duke of ARGYLL, who maintains that the Marquis of
SALISBURY, in his last year's denial of any change of Indian policy
on the part of the Government, though he did not lie like truth,
told truth like a lie—and the Marquis of SALISBURY, who maintains
that his answer was true to the letter, and that nobody has any
business with its relation to the spirit.
Lord GREY moved an Amendment, regretting that Parliament had
not been consulted before war had been declared. But nobody sup-
ported or seconded him; and the Duke of SOMERSET rapped him over
the knuckles in that candid spirit in which his Grace loves to say
and do disagreeable things.
Lord BEACONSFLELD, in a comparison of the policy of his party
twenty-five years ago with that of the Opposition, now made his
points and got his laughs like a veteran actor:—
"We found ourselves, some five-and-twenty years ago, advocating a cauae
with a warm conviction, but one which was probably not supported by the
House to which we appealed, or the nation. The receaa had passed. We had
all of us made a good many speeches, in which we had probably not measured
our language more than in lome more modern speeches with which you are
acquainted. (Laughter.) Many of us had written many letters, though not
so many, perhaps, as some individuals of the present day. (Renewed laughter.)
And under these circumstances, being also members of a society of great
activity and organisation, more active than the Afghan Committee—
(laughter)—and having agitated the country for a considerable time by these
sincere expressions of our opinions, we did think it was our duty when Par-
liament met that we should test the opinion of the House upon the question
which we had so long described as of the highest importance and most urgent
interest."
Don't nde off on official squabbles, but challenge our policy to a
Division—and be beaten.
Nothing can be more triumphant than the way this great master
of fence nourished his weapon, and defied the othur side to come on.
It was as pretty sword-swinging as could be seen, ami must have
delighted the ladies present. Jjfext week my Lord B. will have his
wish—Lord HALIFAX will distinctly raise the question as to the
policy of the war.
In the meantime there will be no Amendment on the Address, as
Lord GRANVILLE explained, because there is no wish to refuse the
means for supporting the gallant soldiers who have already reaped
the first fruits of victory in the Khyber and the Kurum.
In the Commons, Mr. E. STANHOPE having given Notice of Motion
to take the charges of the war out of India s pocket, Mr. FAWCETT
gave notice that he would oppose it.
News of General ROBERT'S gallant clearing of the Peiwar Pass was
cheered from all sides of the House. What person, of what party,
does not cheer every British deed of valour, daring, and resolution,
apart altogether from the policy of the war in which the deed is
done!
Lord CASTLEREAQH moved, and Mr. HALL seconded, the Address.
The Marquis of II AHTI.VGTON admitted as undeniable, that
Government naving received abundant proof of the confidence of

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Parliament, had a right to enter on the war. That for the safety of
our soldiers, the interests of the Empire and mercy to the enemy;
being begun, it must be carried on vigorously, and to a decisive
issue. All that was quite apart from the policy, or justice of this
war. He had come to the conclusion, on the papers, that it was un-
justifiable. Then he criticised Lord CRANBKOOK'S Despatch, and
contended it gave an unfair impression of the Government action
in 1873. It looked as if the Government had been studiously picking
a quarrel with the AMEER. If Russia was advancing, let us be on
our guard, but it does not follow that the best way to do that is to
Sush our frontier half-way to hers. Parliament had been kept in the
ark. It would be asked to pronounce its judgment on the war, and
the policy which had led to it.
Mr. GLADSTONE criticised the language of the Address. He should
leave that to Punch.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER [answered Lord HABTINGTON
from his brief. Lord CIUN BROOK had drawn a fair inference. The
j Government didn't want to pick a quarrel with the AMEER. They
| found it ready picked. All they wanted was to protect India and
'keep its people quiet. But when a Russian Envoy was received at
! Cabul, and a British one turned back—war was inevitable. Govern-
i ment didn't want to annex territory—all they wanted was to bar
i the back-door to India.
Sir C. DILKE asked for papers, and was promised all that could be
published without letting official cats out of their bags.
Mr. W. E. FORSTER asked for more papers, and defended Lord
NORTHBHOOK'S and the Duke of ARGYLL s dealings with the AMI.I:I:.
They were in one mind, and it was the right one.
Ix>rd ROBERT MONTAGU pitched into all the Governments that
had touched the question. They had set the AMEER'S back up, and
taught him to distrust us, among them, and one was as bad as
another. (Does Lord ROBERT write for the Pall Mall Gazette ?)

Mr. DUNNING complained there was no Irish grievance in the
Speech. Mr. O'CONNOR POWER, and Mr. SULLIVAN denounced the
war as a violation of national independence.
Sir J. LUBBOOK doubted the wisdom and policy 'of the war, but
thought the AMEER had drawn it on himself.
Mr. CROSS said as there was not going to be any legislation before
Christmas, there need not be any allusion to it in the Speech, and
promised Irish Members they would find Ireland had not been
forgotten, when the Sessions' list of Bills was brought out.
Friday.—The Lords did nothing beyond having Lord CAIRNS
sworn in as Earl CAIRNS AND GARMOYLE. (A narrow miss, by one
letter, of an ominous name. "Garboil" means a mess.)
In the House of Commons Mr. WHITBREAD gave Notice of a Vote
of Censure of the conduct which has led to the war with Afghan-
istan. Would the Government give him a day ?" Not a bit of it,"
said the CHANCELLOR of the Excni;Q.ujiR. "Why hadn't they
moved an Amendment on the Address?" "Well, I will, if you
like," said Ma. CHAMBERLAIN; and straightway named one—
extempore.
Lord HABTINGTON, with his usual mitit sapientia, showed Sir
STAFFORD NOHTHCOTE what a mess matters would probably get into
if he did not give Mr. WHITBREAD a day.
Mr. GLADSTONE reminded the Government that if they wouldn't
give a day Mr. WHITBKEAD might take one. The Report on the
Address wasn't voted yet. •
After a struggle and a flounder, in which Sir STAFFORD compared
the House—it should have been himself—to Mr. Punch's tCJohn
Hull in a Fog," and in which Messrs. GOSCHEN, RYLANDS, MILLS,
RATHBONE, NEWDEGATE, and CHILDERS took part,—confusion got
worse confounded, and light less visible than ever,—Sir STAFFORD
accepted the suggestion to let the Report stand over till Monday
when Mr. WHITBREAD will make his Motion as an Amendment. So
my Lord B. will have his wish, after all!

New.
I SOON discover, that, for thoroughly enjoying the conversation at
JOSSLYN era's table, I ought to have belonged to an Old County
iamily. It being impossible to be elected as a Member of an Old
County family on the spot, I am obliged to content myself with
trying to interest myself in whatever subject Mrs. LAWLEIGH BYRNE
is conversing about with JOSSLYN DIKE on her left, or attempting
to beguile her into interesting herself in me,
I dare say, that, apart from the Old County set, Mrs. LAWLEIGH
BYRNE would be delightful. But as one of the Old County set, and
mixed up in it, she seems unable to speak on any but Old County
topics.
Mrs. TUPTON, with the evident false front, JOSSLTN DYKE'S Aunt,
keeps up quite an animated discussion on kindred matters on my
right: HOSHFORD and Miss AYSFOHD SYNGE are, so to speak, in
the same swim. I can't swim, with this stream at least; and so,
figuratively, I sit on the bank watching the others, and wishing for
some subject to be started that shall be as a touch of nature to
make the whole world kin. This means, on reflection (for 1 have

plenty of time to reflect), that I want something to be started that I
can talk about. In fact, I 'm not quite sure, after my enforced
silence, whether I shouldn't be glad to have all the talk to myself.
My one chance is with HOSHFORD, whom I had recognised as an
acquaintance, whose life I had fondly imagined had been passed
chiefly in London, and who therefore would be at home on con-
genial matters. Not a bit. He is at this moment eloquent upon
the merits of some archery parties and pio-nics, given by some well-
known Old County People in the past summer: and he and Miss
AYSFORD SYNGE are comparing notes about the flirtations that took
place on those occasions, the marriages that are on the tapis,
the probability of the Fourth Light Something succeeding the
Thirteenth Heavy Somethingelses at the garrison town, and the
particular advantages or disadvantages of that change of military
contingent to this part of the county.
Miss SYNGE is a washed-out young Lady—a sort of "symphony,"
in no colour in particular. She is not exactly tall, nor lanky, nor
gawky, but long—a symphony in neutral tint, a note of WHIST-
LEE'S long drawn out. Had I met her in one of the obscure pas-
sages on The Mote, I should have taken her for the Resident Ghost.
[Happy Thought (all to myself, having no one to say it to). Why is
The Mote like one of Mr. ROBERT BROWNING'S poems 1 Because it's
full of obscure passages. Remember this, and ask it presently.
Only if Mr. ROBEBT BROWNING doesn't happen to belong to one of
their own Old County families, I don't think there "g muoh chance
of my conundrum being appreciated.]
Mr. PELKIN WADD, the ex-Master in Chancery, at the other end
of the table, is talking about the state of the roads and labourers' cot-
tages with Mr. AYSFORD SYNGE, while Mr. SANDILANDS' conversa-
tion is entirely about fishing, in which Mrs. AYSFORD SINGE appears
to be deeply interested.
There are only two subjects which seem, for a short time, to
unite them all—one is Apples, and the other Potatoes.
I think I may venture on Apples. I try it with Mrs. LAWLEIOH
BYRNE, while for one moment there is a break in her conversation
with JOSSLYN.
"Is this a great apple - growing county?" J ask, with the
deeply interested air of an inquirer into statistics.
Well," she replies, with rather a defiant manner, apparently
resenting my question as an impertinent curiosity about county
matters that cannot possibly concern me, "this is not a cider
country."
"Oh," I say, glad to find that I have succeeded in starting a
subject for both oil us, and beginning to feel for the first time that
I have, as it were, at least a small stake in the county; "not like
Devonshire, then?"
"Oh, not in the least!" she returns, with a supercilious smile,
and turning the light of her eyes full on to me as though she were
detecting an impostor, she adds, emphatically; "not in the least bit
like Devonshire!"
If I yielded to impulse, for the mere sake of keeping up the con-
versation, I should immediately rejoin, "Oh! then there's no
cream?" But, fortunately, this subtle remark of mine is pre-
vented by HOSHFORD, who, addressing her from the opposite side
of the room, observes,—"I hear it's been a bad apple-year with
you, Mrs. BYRNE?" This brings up Mr. RENDLESHAM: of Pikley,
and then all the others.
RENDLESHAM says, despairingly, "I can't get apples anywhere,"
as if he had lived on them all his life, and would die within a very
short time if the supply wasn't kept up.
Every one pities Mr. KK.VMLKSIIAM.
Mr. SYNGE wishes he had kept his apples till now. This sounds as
if he regrets not/having brought a lot [of them in his pocket to eat
himself, and let friends have a few bites. Unfortunately it appears
he sold them early at a very low figure. His tone is that of a man
whom ruin is staring in the face.
SANDILANDS asserts, with the air of a man who is giving up life
as one grand mistake altogether, that he had offered a fabulous sum
per bushel for apples, but couldn't get them.
DYKE wishes ne had known this last week, as he sent his last up
to London and only got a very poor price for them.
"It's been the same with potatoes," observes PELKIN WADD.
"Worse!" remarks SANDILANDS, moodily.
"Have your potatoes been bad, Mr. SANDILANDSP" asks Mrs.
BYRNE, in a tone of intensely sympathising pity, leaning forward,
and looking down the table at him.
SANDLLANDS replies that " he really can't get a potato."
This is said with such an utter abandonment of all hope of ever
getting a potato here or hereafter, that I wonder JOSSLYN DYKB
doesn't order QOOL to put up whatever cold boiled ones are left from
dinner for the poor potatoless man to take away with him.
{Happy Thought. Good title for a country story—The Potatolest
Man .- a Tale of Hard Times .']
JOSSLYN DYKE now joins in.
"You '11 never get any potatoes on your land," he says, with an
air of authority, until you use Dumpton's Dressing."
SANDILANDS doesn't believe in Dumpton's Dressing. No more does
AYSFORD SYNGE. The ladies are entirely against Dumpton's Dress-
ing. I should like to cut in with some pleasantry about their being
still more against Dumpton's J7»-Dressing, but I feel that anything
of this sort would be out of place among the Old County families.
PELKIN WADD declares his belief in planting potatoes close
together. This sounds sociable, and pleasant for the potatoes.
Mrs. BYRNE won't hear of it. Her gardener, DIXON (they all nod, as
much as to imply, oh yes, we know DIXON), never plants closely.
RENDLESHAM thinks DIXON 's right, but the secret of planting is
to out the potatoe in half, "that," says RENDLESHAM triumphantly,
"is the only safe way."
SANDILANDS begs his pardon: he has tried it. His advice is, "Cut
it into quarters. Then you may rely on a crop."
RENDLESHAM denies this warmly. SANDILANDS asserts it with
equal warmth.
HOSHFOBD thinks that potatoes should be planted whole and close
together. Mrs. BYRNE says not whole, but close.
JOSSLYJT DYKE insists upon RENDLESHAM'S plan with a modifica-
tion. "Cut them in half, he says, " but plant at good intervals."
"Deep ?" asks SYNGE.
"Oh, no, not deep!" cries Mrs. BYRNE, appealing earnestly to
DYKE. "You don't mean deep, do you Mr. DYKE?"
DYKE is sorry to differ from the beautiful widow, but his candid
opinion is in favour of depth for the potatoes.
"Nevor deep, my dear JOSSLYN, says SANDILANDS, smiling at
such a preposterous idea.
"It surely depends upon the soil," observes old Mrs. TUPTON,
timidly.
It appears that whether they '-ve planted them deep or shallow,
whether they 've used Dumpton's Dressing, or planted them widely
or closely, the result is the same—they 've got, they say. "no pota-
toes—to speak of." And yet they 've been speaking of them for the
last half-hour.
Apples and potatoes carry us right through dinner. Unfortu-
nately for me, I cannot recollect any good stories about apples or
potatoes; and knowing nothing about them, except as to methods of
cooking them, and only one of eating them, I am obliged to listen.
Suddenly, as if by the touch of a spring, the conversation changes
entirely. Some one has observed that the best potato-ground was
by Cotley's Farm; whereupon RENDLESHAM asks, "Who has got
Cotley's now?"
Nobody seems to know. PELKIN WADD has heard that it was in
the market again, and Mrs. AYSFORD SYNGE thinks that Mr. GASH
of Saltend has bought it; when DYKE turns to GOOL, and observes—
"GOOL, do you know who's got Cotley's!"
The Phantom Butler replies, solemnly, "No one won't take it
now, Sir."
He says nothing more, but it is enough. Apples and potatoes
have had their day.
"Ah, of course f" exclaims SANDILANDS, suddenly remembering.
"It's next to The Grange, and it's getting just as bad, they say."
"Really!" exclaims Mrs. LAWLEIGH BYRNE.
"Yes, Mrs. BYRNE," says Miss SYNOE, in answer to the inquiry,
"it's quite true. No one will live in the place."
My opportunity has arrived at last.
"Bad drainage?" I ask.
"Oh, nothing of that sort," returns Mrs. BYBNE, again resenting
my interference in what may be considered as Confidential County
Matters. "That could be cured. But you know when a house once
gets the reputation of being haunted, you can't induce people to
take it."
"It's more than a reputation," observes JOSSLYN DYKE, gravely.
"It's a fact."
We are all listening, and old Mrs. TUPTON gives a perceptible
shudder.

KNOWING that at this critical crisis it is the bounden duty
of every one to give the world the benefit of his opinions in print, 1
choose you, Sir, as the channel whereby to convey mine.
I need hardly say, Sir. that the Times has the benefit of my yearly
subscription. That judicious paper never commits itself nor its
readers to a course from which retreat is impossible. The Daily
Telegraph is too deckled, not to say violent, for my taste | and the
Standard and Morning Post are so wedded to their convictions as, in
the present critical state of affairs, to be quite out of the question
for a candid man with a mind fully open to conviction. Of the
Daily News I say nothing, as; with its views so harshly pronounced
against the present order of things, taking it in is out of the question.
For the present I am satisfied to pin my political faith to the Times
alone, and sing, with a slight and merely verbal modification of my
famous old ereed:—
"To Church and Crown my loyalty
Mo man shall e'er see ralter;
And in Lord B. my faith shall be,
Until the Timct do alter!"

AMONGST the Parliamentary struggles in prospect, one of not the
least important is the yet undetermined Battle of the Whiskeys,
Irish and Scotch. An Irish Member has already given notice of a
motion for the Improvement of Spirits in Bond. To this, one of
Scotland's representatives will perhaps move an Amendment declar-
ing that the best way to imprtre Irish spirits in bond would be
transferring them to St. Patrick's Purgatory.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
ALVADOS — Its
Bastilh—"No.
20."—At the
Princes s' s—
The Canter-
bury Pilgrim-
age to Trafal-
gar; after
which a Pott-
script.
SIB,
I HAVEN'T
kept a bill of the
Play produced at
the Princess's ten
days ago, but any
spectator of that
remarkable piece
is not likely to
forget it in a
hurry. The title
of the Play is
"No. 20," which
sounds uncom-
monly like the
old-fashioned an-
nouncement from
the Chairman at
EVANS'S—"No.
20—in the books "; only it isn't " in the books," but "in the Bas-
tille." And this Bastille is the Prison of Calvados, in France, not
our old friend of the Terror in Paris.
"No. 20 " is the number of a cell in the Bastille; and the Authors,
Messrs. 'ALBEHY AND HATTON, fully conscious of the vein of subtle
humour they were working, and foreseeing how the audience, expect-
ing a good thrilling serious melodrama, would be completely sold,
might have thrown some little light on the subject by boldly styling
their piece
"No. 20 ;"
or, Messrs. ALBKUY and HATTON'S Sell.'
The story (I beg to remind my reader that I have no programme,
and must trust to a very imperfect memory for names, and to the
correctness of my ear in this case) is this:—A young gentleman of
the name of Ne'erwrong (it sounded like this), has left Calvados
before the Play began—(oh, why did he return ?)—and he and his
friend Daytoosh or Laytoosh—I don't know which, but anyhow
a "Toosh ;" so, for safety, let us say "Toosh "—who had quitted
Calvados at the same time, are both supposed to be dead. Toosh
is a bold, bad man, and Ne'erwrong is a moderately bold, good man,
and both return to Calvados just as the old Duke of Nemours, a
feeble Pantaloon, is being married to Miss FOWLER, whose maiden
name I did not catch, which is unimportant, as she is no sooner
introduced than she changes, and becomes The Duchess. Well;
The Duchess was in love with Ne'erwrong; so that when Ne'erwrong
turns up, and she'has to explain matters to him, Ne'erwrong is
very much annoyed, and is on the point of leaving the house (because
he is a good young man), when an eccentric ecclesiastic,—who
has probably received theatrical "orders,"—wearing, apparently,
the bauds of a modern English barrister, and round his waist a
most obtrusive set of beads—rushes in, and informs everybody on
the stage that the aforesaid old Pantaloon is dead, which is no
more news to the audience than the announcement of the lamented
decease of Her Majesty Queen ANNE would have been. The fact
is, that in a very well-painted front-scene, representing the cathedral
cloister—at least I think so—we had seen that artful Toosh, as
Clown, enticing his stupid old Pantaloon of a cousin, the Duke,
behind a tombstone, where he slily induced him to stare at a cobweb
up above, and. while thus engaged, Toosh gave him his coup-de-
grace with Ne'erwrong's knife. How Toosh obtained Ne'erwrong't
knife is a detail; and Toosh being next-of-kin to the old Pantaloon
(deceased), becomes Duke of Nemours.
After a time, Ne'erwrong is condemned for the murder, and, when
he is in prison, The Duchess contrives his escape, by sewing a rope
into her crinoline, and making love to the Head Gaoler of the Bastifie
—the biggest fool ever placed in such a responsible office—with whom
she partates of cake (pound cake, probably, as "in for a penny, in
for a pound "-cake), a slice of .which, wrapped in a letter from The
Duchess, this utterly idiotic Gaoler takes to Ne'erwrong, who, for
the time being, is occupying a cell the bars of which had been
broken by a prisoner who has recently escaped, evidently an ex-
cellent reason for placing in it a condemned criminal of such im-
portance as Ne'erwrong. Of course, Ne'erwrong takes the rope
out of the crinoline (its removal from The Duchess's dress making
no perceptible difference), climbs up to the broken bars, gets out
—awful excitement—knocks a brick or a stone down, when, of
course, the fool of a Gaoler'in the next cell says, ""What'sthat?"
and, equally of course, The Duchess Replies. "On, nothing!" while
she, keeping him with his back to the window, goes on to explain
that it was only the wind, or the oat, or something of the sort that
has served as an excuse in melodramas from time immemorial, and
is invariably accepted, as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of
any startling noise, by gaolers, or warders, or officers on duty, far
less stupid than is this, hopeless idiot, the Gaoler of the Bastille
of Calvados.
Exeunt omnes, including the table, with candle, bottle, and cake
on it, and the chairs—quite a spiritualistic stance effect this—and
then everything is turned inside out, and we are on the ramparts.
Ne'erwrong appears, still climbing—he jumps off a wall into the
arms of some singing fishermen below—he is shot at by everybody
who can get a gun, and well missed by the whole party, when it
suddenly occurs to the fool of ,a Gaoler to denounce the young
woman whom he had treated to cake and wine in the condemned
cell; whereupon the young woman, on the point of being arrested
by the soldiers, throws oft her cloak, exclaims "I am the Duchess
of Nemours!" and everybody bows respectfully, and lets her go
free, implying, "Oh, if you're the Duchess of Nemours, of course
we 've nothing to say. You can do as you like. Only why didn't
you tell us so before, and we 'd have let the young man out. Any-
thing to oblige a Duchess!"
After this, Timsh takes more than is good for him, talks in his
sleep, is overheard by the Priest, is advised to go to confession, and,
being unaccustomed to private speaking, poor Toosh makes a muddle
of it, and confesses to Ne'erwrong, who, somehow or another, has
got into a sort of brown domino, which is mistaken by the fuddled
Tooth for a monk's habit,—neither of them knowing much about
the matter professionally. Then they meet at a Fancy Ball, where
this fuddled penitent drops in, quite casually, as a good starting-
point for a pflgrimage, and here, confronted with Ne'erwrong, he
is accused of the murder of that poor old Pantaloon, and at it they
go, with two swords, hammer and tongs, sparks flying, steel clash-
ing, until, of course, the bold bad man Toosh is run through the
body, and, much to the delight of everyone on and off the stage,
down goes Toosh, and down comes the Curtain,—and so ends Messrs.
ALBERT AND HATTON'S Condemned Sell.
Following the noble example of that bold, bad, inebriate Toosh, I
joined a band of Canterbury Pilgrims, and on the first opportunity
went to see Trafalgar at the Canterbury Hall. For the benefit of
all intending Canterbury Pilgrims—and I trust there will be many,
the entertainment being weD worthy of support—it is as well to
state that Trafalgar commences at about 915, and is over easily
by 11. The scenery, chiefly panoramic, by Mr. HANNS, is so good
as to warrant the adaptation, in his favour, of Dr. WATTS'S well-
known line—
"Tour little Uauns was never made"
to do anything else but the very best scene-painting.
Unfortunately, I my Canterbury Pilgrim companion was one of
those gentlemen who know everything; and in the absence of a
programme (by which I subsequently corrected his historical and
geographical information), he described, with singular inaccuracy,
each of the scenes as they appeared. First, there was a ship at
anchor. This, my friend said, was The Redoubtable, of course it
wasn't; it was The Victory. Then followed a capital representation
of the same ship.in the vicinity of a volcanic mountain. "That,"
said my friend, positively, "is 4ftna." (It was Strqmboli.) Then
we came to an island, which he assured me was " Gibraltar." He
knew it, he had been there. It was so like, that he applauded hear-
tily. It turned out to be the island of Madeira. After this, came a
scene at Gibraltar, which, of course, he was certain was Malta.
"Gib," to judge by the sparkling ballet-dance taking place in
one of the main thoroughfares, must have been a very pleasant
though perhaps rather dangerous place to be quartered at.
The great effect is, of course, reserved to the last—the scene on
board the Victory at the battle of Trafalgar. The boy who played
Nelson is, evidently, deeply impressed with the dignity of the charac-
ter, and the great responsibility of the situation. He never loses his
presence of mind for a second. In the midst of the terrific blazing,
panging, cracking of musketry, and explosion of firework shells, he
is only concerned for the honour of England, and anxious to see
that Mr. VILLIEHS, his manager, shall not be disappointed in his
expectation of NELSON retaining one attitude during the'.entire
present engagement, and doing his duty like a man. Literally like
a man, as he is only a boy.
The fatal shot strikes the hero, who is carried below. On his
death the Curtain falls, to enthusiastic cheering; and Trafalgar
must be as great a success for the Canterbury, as the battle itself
was for England.
I saw the boys, after their work, making pell-mell for their
dressing-rooms, all in a hurry, all excited, all—except Nelson, who

AN APPLAUDING POPULACE.
A CERTAIN book having been condemned, and confis-
cated, on a Magistrate's conviction for immorality, 670
copies of it were seized by the Police. The conviction
having been subsequently quashed by the Court above on
a point of law, the owner of the books the other day, at
Bow Street, obtained an order for their restoration. Ac-
cording to a Police report :—
"On leaving the Court the complainant ordered a cab and
presented an order for immediate execution to Inspector WOOD,
by whom they were at once given up. A mob cheered the com-
plainant as he left the Police Station."
The mob usually assembled in front of a Police Station
appears to be one which sympathises very particularly
with the passengers in Her Majesty's omnibus—the
Police-van.
In the foregoing instance the mob cheered the com-
plainant not Decauso they supposed him to have been
wrongfully convicted of disseminating pernicious litera-
ture, hut because they believed him really to have com-
mitted that offence, and were glad that he had succeeded
in evading the law. So mobs cheered the Claimant not
because they thought him the rightful heir, but, on
the contrary, considered him a bold impostor and a tho-
roughgoing scoundrel whonij as one of their own order,
they wished to succeed in foisting himself into a fine old
English family. Such mobs are of course not to be
confounded with the British Public which attends the
Houses of Parliament, and cheers the political leaders
on both sides, Ministerial and Opposition. Else, what
should we have to think of our greatest Statesmen?
The cheers which testified an acquaintance with the
books above indicated, and admiration of their author,
certainly show that education has penetrated the lowest
stratum of Society. But is this exactly a " cheering"
matter?

came last, walking with grave dignity, and apparently unconscious
of the admiration of the spectators who happened to be present.
His demeanour was precisely the same off, as it had been on the
stage, and not one jot of his earnestness, nor of his manly bearing,
was abated. It must be of such stuff that our great Actors are
made. Is that his future career? Nobody on the Stage has for a
loHg time interested me more than did this boy Nelson who played
so well for " England, Home, and Beauty " in the private-boxes.
I find I was wrong last week in attributing Les Fourchambaults
to M. SARDOU, instead of M. EMILE AUOIER. After the produc-
tion of the adaptation called The Crisis, at the Haymarket, I
read in the Daily Telegraph how "the difficult task" (that is, of
adaptation) had been "boldly undertaken and manfully grappled
by Mr. JASTKS ALBERY." Heavens! What has he done? Simply
adapted a French play! As POE'S Raven said. "Nothing more.
If by Mr. ALBERY'S " boldly undertaking " the adaptation, is implied
that his knowledge of French is limited, then of course the critic is
right in complimenting him on his audacity in tackling a play
written in a comparatively unknown tongue. Half-hours with the
best Dictionaries would be a task requiring all the " boldness," all
the "manliness," and all the "grappling" irons in the adapter's
possession. The expression offers a tine opportunity for a Cartoon,
or a Leighton-like statue— " ALBEP.Y grappling with Les Fourcham-
baults. Magnificent! There could be a companion picture show-
ing "Mr. ALBERY grappling with Mr. HATTON in the Condemned
Sell, No. 20." Both charming notions for the Academy. Recom-
mended. Mr. ALBERY should also "manfully grapple with the
same subject for a ballet at the Alhambra, and call it Les Four
Sham Beaux. Suggested gratis by ycr/n REPRESENTATIVE.

AN IRISH EDUCATOR.
PUNCH is always pleased to do justice to modest merit. He is glad
to bring from under its local bushel of Cork an Irish educational
light which deserves the colossal candlestick of his columns. He
gives the programme verbatim, except the name; which he withholds
from regard to the modesty of this Irish phoenix—Si monumentum
qiueris Corcubium circumspice!

dious, and well-ventilated School for Select Male and Female Pupils is taste-

Half an hour of sunshine daily is indeed a rjaltry pittance. But the medi-

IN THE MAJOR KEY.
MR. PUNCH has been requested to publish the fol-
lowing correspondence. He prints it for what it is
worth, without vouching for its authenticity :—
House of Commons, 5th December.
MR. PUNCH, SOER,
I WOULD have you know, Sorr, that the follow-
ing epistles are a true copy of letters I have received.
If I do not see them in your next number, I will be after
annihilating you. So be careful.
Yours, defiantly,

PBOFESSOB RUSKIN presents his compliments to Major
O'GoBMAN, and begs to inform him that he (the Pro-
fessor) has never accused him (the Major) of "having
flung a bottle of whiskey in the face of the British
Public." Major O'GoBMAjr has been misinformed.
n.
LORD BEACONSFIELD presents his compliments to Major
0'GonMAN, and can find no resemblance between the
career of the Major, and the adventures of the purely
imaginary hero ot Lothaire. However, Lord BEACONS-
FIELD has requested some of the Gentlemen who are
kind enough to assist him in the management of public
affairs, to read the Novel, with a view to the discovery of
the likeness to which exception has been taken. Should
Major O'GOBMAN have cause of complaint, Lord BEA-
CONSFIELD will have much pleasure in tendering him his
apologies.

MB. GLADSTONE begs to inform Major O'GOBMAN in
reply to his note, that although he (Mr. GLADSTONE) has
spoken and written about some millions of subjects, how
many millions he will not charge himself with the re-
sponsibility of defining, he has never to his knowledge
made any allusion in writing, or by word of mouth, to
Major O'GoRMAN.
IV.
THE Emperor of RUSSIA has never treated Major
O'GORMAN with intentional discourtesy. Should the
Major have any doubt upon the subject, the Emperor
will be glad to see him. The Major, on crossing the
frontier, will be kind enough to give his name, and ask
for the train to Siberia.

MAN of his friendship. The Sultan would be glad to
borrow a hundred pounds, if Major O'GoRMAN knows
anybody having that sum to advance.

HE six months had passed
The Grange had been re-
built, and no one (not even
the Officers of the Insurance
Company) suspected thai
the Countess had been the
incendiary. The tragical
causes of the old General's
suicide were half forgotten.
Sir PBRCIVAL'S bigamy was
only remembered as a nine
days' wonder. It was sum-
mer time again in the bou-
doir of Camberwell Castle.
EMILY, the cold, proud
Lady EMILY, was seated in
a luxurious fauteuil, turn-
ing over the costly leaves
of ner jewel-covered photo-
graph-book.
_ I wish I could care for
him," she murmured,
her dark, lustrous eyes
rested upon the portrait of
an exceedingly handsome young man; "but no—it cannot be! He
is not my equal in talent. What is birth without education?"
The question was never answered, for at this moment the doors of
the boudoir were flung open, and three domestics, in gorgeous livery,
announced the approach of her ladyship's father.
"You may leave us," said the Marquis, addressing his obsequious
retainers; then turning to his daughter, "EMILY," he said,
"we are once more alone. Tell me, are you prepared to marry
PLANTAGBNKTP"
She hesitated and trembled. Her cheeks were'1 now red as fire,
now pale as snow. Giving her a few minutes to recover her com-
posure (the Marquis had been trained in the Diplomatic Service),
the sagacious old Cabinet-Minister continued,—
"Surely this marriage is an excellent idea. PLANTAGENET f rom
every point of view will be a most desirable parti. Why do you
object to him?"
"His birth "faltered EMILY.
"Is nobler than our own. Not only is he a Duke (a small matter
in these days), but his ancestors were settled in Britain long before
ours. Do you not know that a chief of his name and lineage was the
first to invite JULIUS C-ESAR to an oyster supper P"
"Yes, in B.C. 55," EMILY was forced to admit, for she was equally
well up in her Freeman and her Debrett. Then, plucking up
courage, "Dear father, darling father," she murmured, coaxingly,
"he is awfully behind the times. He has positively no conversa-
tion!"
Is that all?" replied the Marquis, with a smile of relief. "My
dearest child, he has greatly improved since you last saw him. But
you shall judge for yourself. I will send him to you."
Five minutes later, the handsome young Duke was standing before
her. The father had given place to the lover.
"You wished to test my knowledge of current events," said the
graceful young noble, without the slightest embarrassment. "I am
ready to undergo your examination.
"Can you give me the names of the Aldermen who have not passed
the Chair?" asked the proud beauty.
"Indeed I can." And he promptly enumerated them.
"Right!" she replied, rather surprised. "And what do you
know about the Metropolitan Board of Works?"
"A great deal." Aid on the heels of the question came a rapid
summary of the duties of the Board, its debt, its rating powers, the
names of its Engineers, its Chairmen of Committees, and the titles
and services of its Chairman.
"And the most interesting facts in relation to our own and other
Governments?"
"Certainly." And he rapidly gave her the names, weights,
and colours of our own Royal Family, Foreign Sovereigns, and
Heads of their Governments, the Queen's Ministers, and Ambassa-
dors at home and abroad. He threw off an alphabetical list of the
Members of the House of Commons, and sketched the legislation of
1878. Then he dashed into the eclipses of 1879, and wound up with
a list of the principal Insurance Offices in London. An intelligent
summary of the agricultural statistics of Great Britain followed,
with the numbers of our shorthorn cattle, the produce of the French
vineyards du premier cru, and the shipwrecks on the British coasts.
After touching ughtly on the subjects of deck-loading and cargo-
lines, the National Lifeboat Institution, and the Post-Office Orphan
Home, he discussed, at some length, the prospects and advantages
of codification. Then, after a compendious sketch of the mysteries
of Quarter Sessions, Assessed Taxes, Excise Licences, and Stamps,
he was beginning a list of our Colonial Governors
"Stop, stop! cried Lady EMILY, now thoroughly exhausted.
"I had no idea"
"That I knew so much? But I know a great deal mote."
"I believe you," she replied, with a smile. "Can you relate any
amusing stories?"
"I can," he returned. And he repeated a selection of brilliant
jeux d'esprit.
"You have conquered," she said at last, giving him her hand.
But what has worked this wondrous change? From what source
did you obtain this enormous mass of information, this marvellous
pot-pourri of wit and solid knowledge P"
"I owe everything to this delightful and useful little volume,"
he replied. And, kissing her hand, he gave her MB. PUNCH'S

SOME CHRISTMAS BOOKS FOR CHILDREN.
BRAVO! GEORGE ROUTLEDGE and Sons, specially the Sons, and
their Sons' Sons, and "may they." as Mr. JEFFERSON'S Rip Van
Winkle says, "live long and brosber." How pleasant is the sight
of all these Christmas Books for the Young, and how unpleasant is
the prospect of the Butcher's Book, the Baker's Book, the Candle-
stick Maker's Book, and the Banker's Book, which are the Christ-
mas Books for the Old!
The Baby's Bouquet. Ity WALTER CRANE. Of course a com-
panion to the Baby's Opera of last year, or the year before that—
which? No matter; that was an excellent notion, and this is a
lotion still more excellent. It is a fresh Bunch—not a Mother
Bunch, but a young Daughter Bunch—of old rhymes and tunes,
arranged and decorated in such a way by WALTER CRANE as only
could enter into his (WALTER) Cranium. English rhymes, French
•hymes, and German rhymes. There is a picture of our old friend
Polly [putting the kettle on, and Sukey, her twin sister, taking it
off again. Then there is Et moi de m en courir, with the song of
;he Cuckoo, and the song of the Canards, which, by the way, is
1 Cancan, cancan, cancan," possibly the harmless original of the
dance that has brought so many gay and festive spirits into trouble
with the police. We should like to have seen the "Bonne
Histoire" there also, supposed to be the original of Mr. W. M.
THACKERAY'S Little Billee.
Dear old John Gilpin's Ride was never better illustrated than it
s this year by Mr. R. CALDECOTT, who has also furnished The
House that Jack Built with a new series of pictures. The last is, of
this set. the book for children. It is full of fun; and that picture
where the sly Dog, after successfully worrying the unfortunate Cat,
s seated, smiling to himself in a self-satished manner, in happy
gnorance of the proximity of a terrible Nemesis in the shape of the
Cow with the Crumpled Horn, is inimitable.
One bone we must pick with the author of Children's Theatricals
ror daring to alter the name of Blue Beard's wife. Instead of Fatima
le calls her Belinda! After this one breathes again to find that no
mch heartless liberties have been taken with Sister Anne. Messrs.
PLANCHE and DANCB, who cast their extravaganza of Blue Beard
n France, made the terrible three-tailed Bashaw into Baron Abome-
ique, and his wife was Fleurette. The legend, as every one knows,
being of French origin, Messrs. PLANCHE and DAXCE'S change
was legitimate. Besides, that was written not for children, but for
'he stage. But oh, Mr. KEITH ANGUS, you should have paused ere
'ou disturbed the ancient tradition, and ventured to educate the
rising generation in the belief that Blue Beard's wife was named
Belinda!

I GOT your last line. It's some time since I dropped one to you,
And I guess, my dear boy, you '11 be thinking my answer is just upon due.
"What you said about me was most flatt'ring; I fancy I ham getting known,
And, in course, notoriety's nice, though it brings nasty knocks of its own!
Fools say that's the fate of all fame, and I reckon for once, they 're 0. K.;
There is lots has their knives in me, CHARLIE—that cackle o' mine on the Play
Poked hup the Philistians a few ; but, lor' bless yer, the duffers don't twig,
I must learn elocution, I see, and go in for the clerical rig.
Wot next? Mayn't a cove give it mouth 'cos his patter ain't up to Pall Mall?
Nor sport the straight tip on the fashions, except d la Sixpenny Swell?
The Perlite 's worry well in its way, and it covers a lot, I've no doubt,
But it's cads that like double intenaers as nags me acos I speak hout.
I dp 'ate a Cad, and no error! The out-and-out Swell is my form;
I like my high jinks, like my egg-'ot, mixed stiff, rayther spicy, and warm;
I 'm dead on the high lardy-dardy, I loathes a straignt-lacer or saint,
Forren games, GLADSTONE'S gabble, and Rads,—and wot is fust-rate form if that
ain't?
Some have called me a Cad! I did 'ope as that old bit of 'umbug was stale.
It ought to been snuffed out, I think, since the Nobs took to foiler our trail.
Our sentiments match to a moral; and as for yer grammar and stuff,
'Tain't a haitch or a bar more or less makes a party a snob or a rough.
I say it is mean on one's pals to come down on a chap like this 'ere;
It's discouraging, 'selp me! My views is the fashion, that's puffeckly clear.
In politics, love-larks, amusements, I 'm with the Top Ten to a T,
And it's too bad because I 've just said so, to turn the cold shoulder on me!
As to slang, and strong language, and so on, objections to them is all stuff;
What are they but an anticipation—to-morrer's swell-slang in the rough?
That the nobs prig their patter from ours you may see
by their plays and their books,
And the lingo that's used by FITZFOODLE 's inwented by
SNOBKINS or SNOOKS.
[t is true, when their own sort arelisten in, they mayn't,
p'raps, speak out quite so strong,
But, on the Q.T., bless yer 'art! l? We all do it" 's the
general song;
They must crib from hus "cads," my dear boy! Swells
ain't got much inwention, you see;
But to set up our style and then cut us, is all bloomin'
fiddlededee!
If they don't like our lay, let 'em shift. But, no fear,
they 're too fond of our game.
If yer want to cold-shoulder your pals, and live up to
their style all the same,
"Keep it dark! don't be wulgar or wilent!" in course is
the mealy-mouthed cry;
But you'll only queer flats in that fashion, the sharp sort
is bound to be fly.
Still you and me 're in it, my pippin, and critics as calls
me a Cad
P'raps feel that they 're tarred with my rope, and it's
that, I suppose, makes 'em mad.
It ain't all a matter o' varnish, nor yet of the shiners you
carry;
If my views and my tastes make me Cad, there arc lots of
big Swells like Yours,

CIVIC FESTIVITIES.
(From our Special Reporter.)
"BLACK Monday" has been long a by-word in the
City, and there is reason to suppose that Monday, the 9th
ult., will be remembered as "White Monday'"•—a day
deserving to be marked with the whitest of white stones.
Though not announced as a Bank Holiday, it was vir-
tually observed as such, for business seemed to be sus-
pended by general consent, and people appeared bent on
thoroughly enjoying the great pleasure of the day. This,
it hardly need be said, was the day of Mr. Punch's

with rapturous shouts of mirth, and applause. The
Stock Exchange was literally convulsed on the occasion,
and a similar effect was produced in Lombard Street, at
the Custom House and Lloyd's. The effect upon the
joke market had probably been discounted by certain
knowing speculators; but it was observed that several
bad puns were withdrawn from circulation, and that
Mr. Punch's bon-mots were freely quoted even after
business hours.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

HEOUOH ajdreary and darkling
week. Fog out of doors and
in Parliament. In Lords and
Commons much bandying of
personalities, little discus-
sion of policies. Four speeches
—Earl GREY'S, GLADSTONE'S
in its peroration, GRANT
DUFF'S, and above all Lord
HAETINGTON'S — rise above
the dead level, brightening
the week's dulness, partially
redeeming personality and relieving the irritating iteration. Punch
can't help it if the Parliamentary eloquence of the week seem to him
"like an ill-roasted egg, all o' one side." It could hardly be other-
wise, if the better cause be likely to prompt the more potent plead-
ing. When the preponderance of right and reason seems to Punch
so decidedly in the Opposition scale, he cannot wonder if the
Government balance kicks the beam, whatever the Division may say.
(Lords. Monday, Dec. 0.)—Lord CRANBROOK opened the ball with
his ugly Motion for the consent of the Peers to saddling India with
the cost of operations against the AMEER. The war being "Im-
perial," so it mifjht be argued should be its expense. But India had a
surplus of £-2,136,000, 'including £1,500,000 of new taxes (levied.
Lord C. did not say, to provide an insurance fund against famine),
and for this year the war wasn't likely to cost above a million or
so. So there was the money ready; and the Government wouldn't
be obliged to face the odium of increased Income-tax. All we
wanted was a good Afghan frontier. In 1873 we ought to have
stepped in at the AMEER'S request to defend Afghanistan against
Russia. Lord NORTJTBROOK and the GLADSTONE Cabinet shirked
the duty. Ever since that time the AMEER has leaned from England
and to Russia, till at last he has filled his cup of offence to over-
flowing by receiving a Russian Envoy and refusing to receive an
English one. We can't stand that. Masterful activity must replace
masterly inactivity. We must thrash the AMEEU into a friendly
state of mind. India was looking on. If we didn't lick him, our
prestige was forfeited, our Empire as good as gone.
Lord HALIFAX moved that the House while ready to grant the
means for getting us out of the Afghan mess, regrets that we ever
got into it. The war was all the fault of the Government. For
thirty-eight years we had got along with the Afghans without
fighting, and so we might have gone on, tant bien giie mat, but for
the Cabinet's determining in 1876 to thrust English Envoys down the
AMEER'S throat. As Lord NORTHBROOK wouldn't agree to this, they
had sent out Lord LTTTON, who would do as he was bid. Where
were we going to stop? The further we pushed our occupation,
the worse our position would be, till we had annexed Afghanistan
to find ourselves face to face with Russia, and with 200,000 fighting
Afghans for enemies on our hands besides.

CATCHING
A STRAW."
Curate (visiting a poor Cabman dowii ieilti Bronchitis). "HAVE YOU BEEN IN THE HABIT OF GOING TO CHURCH?"
Poor Cabby (faintly). "CAN'T SAY I HEV, Siu; BUT "—(eagerly)—" I 'VE DRUV A GOOD MANY PARTIES THEBE, SIR!"
Lord LA WHENCE rang the changes on the same air. Though we
?*n't allow Russia to establish herself as supreme in Afghanistan.
11 would be the worst policy to leave our present boundaries and
anticipate the attack of Russia. He believed his own policy had
been the wisest, and would like to see it reverted to. The main
cause of the war was the determination to make the AMEER swallow
English Envoys.
Lord DERBY gave a candid resume of the reasons in favour of the
Government policy, and then of his reasons for voting against them.
He thought the war would be expensive, and might have been
averted by a little diplomacy and forbearance.
The Duke of SOMERSET said India was worth the money.
Lord CARNARVON thought the Government policy unsound and
unjust.
Lord NAPIER AND ETTRICK did not think India ought to pay, but
would support the Government—that is, vote for India's paying.
Lords ATRLTE and ABERDEEN gave their reasons the other way.
(Commons.)—Mr. WHTTBREAD (why not Lord HABTINOTON ?)
moved an Amendment to the Address, disapproving of the course
which has led to the War. Proclaiming his intention of confining
himself to the past (more's the pity!). he overhauled the Big Blue
Book logically and lengthily, contending that the policy of non-
intervention had kept the peace, till Lord SALISBURY took to forcing
British Envoys on the AMEEH. In fact, we had forced the AKEER
into the Bear s hug. Our quarrel was with Russia, but we had hit the
AMEEE, after first picking a quarrel with him. Lord SALISBURY in
his answer to the Duke of ARGYLL last year, had misled the Opposi-
tion and the country.
Mr. Under-Secretary STANHOPE replied for Government. He
denied that the AMEER'S quarrel was against the reception of our
Envoys. He rather liked it. The only difference between Lord
SALISBURY and Lord NORTHBEOOK was as to the when they should
be sent. Lord NOHTHBROOK would have waited till the Russians
were at Merv. Lord SALISBURY thought it wise to be beforehand
with them. When the door was shut in our Empire's face, prestige
bound us to kick it open.
Mr. THEVELYAN gave reasons for thinking that if there was
danger, we would be safer on this side the mountains than in the
wastes and wilds of Afghanistan, ever so far from our base.
Mr. MARTIN said the war had been forced on the Government.
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN said the Government had forced on the war,
and hoodwinked the country.
Mr. RIDLEY said it was all the short-sightedness of the late
Government that had brought about the war.
Mr. FORSTEH said it was all the over-bearing of the present
Cabinet. We had put the AMEER in a cleft stick by insisting on his
reception of our Envoys. What would the Opposition do? Make
peace as soon as possible, and satisfy the AMEER that we meant to
recur to the LAWKENCE and NORTHBROOK policy.
From all which it will be seen that the night's talk was a series
of assertions by each side in the teeth of the other, with no prospect
of coming nearer any clear or certain conclusion either as to past
facts, present course, or future policy, if the tire of imputations
and impressions was kept up till tne day of judgment.
Lords (Tuesday).— Earl GREY opened the debate with the
weightiest words spoken since the row began. Call him crotchetty
if you like; he often gets the right sow by the ear, and to Punch's
thinking, had it to-night. He said—
"Tears ago there were great fears of Eussian influence on Afghanistan; and
the Government of that day did a very unhappy thing—they engaged in a war
with Afghanistan. It will be found by correspondence which passed at that
time that, though a Minister, I was averse from that mode of seeking to pro-
tect our interests in India. At that time I argued, as I argue now, that the
real mode of protecting those interests and protecting British India from in-
vasion is to take as little notice as possible of such influences, not to excite
ourselves, and not to give rise to fears in others by showing that we ourselves
were afraid. I pointed out that by calmly holding the balance of good
government, by bringing forward sound financial measures, by extending
means of communication, and accomplishing other works worthy of a civilised
Power, we should do more for the protection of our Indian Empire than by
attaching importance to the alarming reports of every Bussian bagman."
"Hear!
Punch.
hear!" said the House, and " Hear! hear!" says Mr.

[DECEMBKK 21, 1878.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"But even assuming," continued Lord GIIEY,—
:'That my policy of good law and material improvements would not be
sufficient, and that you ought to take measures to avert the danger of Russian
influence, I shall still contend that the policy of Her Majesty's Government
is the one most calculated to increase the influence of Russia. We have been
told that Afghanistan should be strong, independent, and friendly. So
Government proceeds to make her weak, dependent, and hostile. You can't
govern Afghanistan. You can't hold it under 60,000 men, and you can't
bar communication betwixt AMEER and Russia, or secure information for your
agents. As to frontier, having read all that has been written on both sides of
the question, it appears to me that the arguments for maintaining the
existing frontier are very much stronger, from a common-sense view, than
those for changing it. As to the cost of the war, it would be a wicked and
unjust act to employ the revenues of India in the carrying on of an un-
righteous war—which would be to the detriment of the people of India. In
justice the Government of tb.ii country ought to undertake the cost of this
war themselves, and not throw upon India, which is much less able to bear it,
a burden which arises from their own imprudence."
And so Lord GREY ended the first speech which has addressed
itself not to the personalities but the policy of the matter under
discussion.
The LORD CHANCELLOR proceeded, at legal length, to give the
reasons against Lord GREY'S "ostrich policy," contending that
"masterly inactivity" had come to grief, and that the AMBER'S
quarrel with us dated from 1873.
Lord SELBORNB answered Lord CAIRNS at nearly equal length,
maintaining with equal cogency, the reverse of every one of his pro-
positions. The Government policy was " bullying and blundering."
Lord HOUGHTON gave his reasons of voting for the Government,
the Marquises of BATH and RIFON for the Amendment.
Lord MIDDLETON thought that the Government could do no more,
and ought to have done no less.
Then LORD NORTH BROOK said his say, of the greatest weight, as
proving what he did and thought when Viceroy. There had been
no change of policy till he left India in 1875, wnen the AMEER was
loyal to England. No Government of India till the present had
taken up the Rawlinson policy. Any quarrel about the reception
of the Russian Embassy at Cabul shoula have been settled between
this country and Russia—not the AMEER.
Lord SALISBURY defended himself against the charge of having
paltered with the Duke of AROYLL in a double sense. The AMEER
had several causes of quarrel. First there was that Oriental Vicar
of Bray, Lord LAWRENCE, who would help all tie facto princes
against de jure. Then there was Lord NORTHBROOK'H impertinent
letter, blowing up the AMEER for his treatment of YAKOOB KHAN.
What we had to resist was a diplomatic invasion of Afghanistan.
That was only to be done by agents on the spot. We had nothing
to tight Russia for. The existence of a Ministry was a small matter,
but to carry this Motion meant handing over the country to men
who looked on India as a burden, and the future triumph of America
over this country as a certainty. (Foul hitting, my Lord, that last
blow.)
Lord CARDWELL, in Lord GRAHVTLLE'S absence, briefly summed
up for the Motion, and Lord BEACONSFIELD replied with effect.
Our north-west boundary was inconvenient. We had had to lead
nineteen expeditions against the frontier tribes in twenty-eight
years. Lord NAPIER of MAGDALA now thought rectification neces-
sary. He had never spoken of a "scientific frontier" the object of
the war, but its probable consequence. Russia had done nothing we
had any right to complain of. She was preparing to hit us in a
weak place, when she expected we were going to hit her. But
things couldh't be allowed to go on as they were. The issue was
between the prestige of England throughout Asia and Europe, and
a peace-at-any-priee policy, which, for a moment, had dimmed even
the majesty ot England.
Then their Lordships Divided. Contents, 201; Non-contents, G5:
majority for the Government, 136.
All's well that ends well. The Opposition would have made a
better fight had the Duke of ARGYLL and Lord GIUNVILLE been in
the battle, but nothing would have altered the result.
(Commons.}—Lord JOHN MANNERS jauntily took up the flail, to
thrash the thrice thrashed straw of the Blue Book, though he bejjan
by promising not to take the elastic off his papers. He said nothing
that had not been better said already, and contrived to be tedious
without taking off his elastic.
Mr. GLADSTONE replied by a disproportionate denunciation of
minute inaccuracies in the Blue Book. When Lord NORTHBROOK
left India the AHEER was friendly, thanks to the policy of all
Viceroys till then. With Lord LYTTON began the new policy oi
"storm and pressure." The quarrel was with Russia, and we had
made the AMEER her whipping-boy. In his peroration, Mr. GLAD-
STONE rose to the height of a great argument, in his prayer to
Heaven to avert the omen of the first Afghan invasion, and save the
country from the responsibility of an unjust and unnecessary war.
Sir R. PEEL was saucy and sprightly after his manner, but the
House was empty, and his fireworks fizzed out, without sparkle or
bang.
Mr. LEATHAM supported the Vote of Censure. The war was un-
just and unnecessary.
Mr. FORSYTE supported the Government. The war was justifiable
and inevitable.
Sir CHARLES DILKE showed that while bullying the AMEER, we
liad let Russia, the real offender, go soot free.
Lord G. HAMILTON defended the Blue Book, justified the war, and
contradicted Mr. GLADSTONE.
Wednesday.—Pause of one day for refreshment, and
Mr. RATHBONE'S little Bill, exempting from disfranchisement
poor people who seek parochial medical aid for themselves or their
families.
Thursday.—Mr. GRANT DUFF gave new life to the debate, by the
best speech yet spoken. Those who want to see a masterly expos/' of
the case against the Government should read it. It would be injustice
to weaken it by condensation, so close-linked is its argument, and
so admirable its wording. It was all pith. The speaker wins by
this speech a* distinctly higher grade than the high one he held
already.
Mr. BOURSE rejoined with a defence as weak as the attack was
strong. He was eminently tedious, and laboured his case out of the
Blue Book at length in inverse ratio with his vigour.
Hosts of eager orators sprang up, and a number of small fry took
their turns to catch or be caught by the SPEAKER'S eye, till ,Mr.
GOSCHEN rising to an overwearied House, among many good points
made none better than when he reminded his hearers that at the
moment Lords BEACONSFIELD and SALISBURY were driving in triumph
from Charing Cross to Downing Street, bearers of "Peace with
Honour" from Berlin, the Russian Envoy was entering Cabul amid
acclamations. But it was the Government which had brought him
there. While there was an intense feeling in many parts of the
House that this war was unjust, it was the duty of the country to
say that Afghanistan must not be allowed to fall under the control
of Russia.
Friday.—Notable, besides a smart stinger from Sir W. HAH-
COTJBT, for the most statesmanlike speech of the week from Lord
HARTINGTON—a most masterly presentation of the Opposition case,
free from irritating and superfluous personalities, justifying the
Motion, and pointing out that the Opposition was as little disposed as
the Government to leave our troops in the lurch, or to sacrifice, or
endanger India. This speech deserves to be reprinted as the best
summary of the week's work, from the Opposition point of view.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER summed up for the Govern-
ment, with that evident desire to be candid which seriously hampers
him m his work as mouthpiece of a firework policy in a British
House of Commons.
The House Divided. 328 for Government, 227 for the Vote of
Censure; majority for Government, 101.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MAKING THE BEST OF CHRISfMAS.
X this season of the
year the shop-win-
dows are deluged
with "seasonable
literature" more
or less redolent of
the holly and the
mistletoe. It has
occurred to Mr.
Punc A that taking
the "hardness of
the times" into
consideration,
truth is rather
sacrificed to effect
in these holiday
publications. Un-
der these circum-
stances, the Sage
of Fleet Street
has thought it ad-
visable to give a
more real view of
Christmas. How-
over, that the som-
bre subject should
not be put of keep-
ing with the tra-
ditional mirth of
the season, he has engaged the pen of one of the most genial of his
staff upon the task, with the following result :—
PETER PLEASANT'S YULE-TIDE GUEST.
Something like a Christmas Day! The rain and snow raced down
from the clouds like two moist madcaps, and glistened with glee on
the pftillant pavement. The mud in the roads was suggestive of
plum-pudding, and you might easily have mistaken the yellow
puddles for the lavishly out-poured contents of a gigantic oven-full of
colossal mince-pies. A roaring, soaking, gladsome Christmas Day,
bringing back delicious memories of the past, and delightful antici-
pations of the future!
And such a merry crowd too! Here was a comical horse (belong-
ing to a still more comical four-wheeler), down upon the wooden
pavement, and affording infinite amusement to a funny old lady en-
cumbered with a pile of enormous boxes, a humorous policeman, and
two cheery professional beggars. Over there was the workhouse,
with its holiday throng of " casuals," full of quips and cranks, to say
nothing of quiddities! And everywhere numbers of "locked-out"
labourers, enjoying with an easy conscience the welcome rest that
had been forced upon them by their masters. Oh, these " locked-
out" labourers appreciated a practical joke as much as any one else,
I warrant ye!
And PETER PLEASANT was keeping Christmas with the best of
them. It was quite dark when the guests began to arrive at the
quaint little house in Upper Dungeon Street; but what did that
matter?
"Such a game! " he shouted, as he shook Uncle JOHN by the hand
and kissed Aunt MARIA. "The Company have cut off the gas, and
so we must depend upon candles. So like them! But I had had
my joke, first! I had got five quarters in arrear!"
And Mrs. PETER smiled, and the Baby crowed and chuckled with
flee.
"Hallo! what's this?" continued PETER, when he had had a
giod look at Uncle JOHN and found that his coat had gone at the
elbows. "Why, I always thought you were a rich man, and put
you down in my assets under the head ' expectations.'"
Aunt MARIA began to titter, and Uncle JOHN shouted with merri-
ment. For a few minutes he could not talk for laughing. At last
he cried, with tears in his eyes,—
"Why, my good boy, we have lost our all, and a good deal more,
in a bank that has stopped payment. Ho, ho,', ho! we had two
shares worth fifty pounds a piece in it, and they have come down
upon us for thousands, my lad—for thousands! Don't they wish
they may get it!"
And then Uncle JOHN told the whole story in his best style, and
again there were roars, and roars and roars of laughter.
"And now to dinner with what appetite we may," sang PETER,
leading the way with his arm round Aunt MARIA'S waist. Uncle
JOHN danced in with Mrs. PETER. All were helped to soup.
"Take some more," cried PETER, with a pleasant twinkle in
his eye.
They obeyed him.
"One plate more!" he cried, with a chuckle.
"Oh, you wag! " shouted Uncle JOHN, with another guffaw. "I
believe this is all you have to give us."
Mrs. PETER laughingly admitted this was indeed the case; and
the fun became fast and furious. Uncle JOHN pretended that now
the soup was some delicious cod, now some toothsome turkey, now
some luscious beef.
"The fact is," explained PETER, "the fishmonger and the butcher
disappointed us. We wanted to be a credit to their establishments
—but they wouldn't let us."
"Good again!" cried Uncle JOHN. "Credit? I see—very good
indeed!"
And now there was a pattering of little feet in the passage, and
the door was throw^i open. In tumbled the children joyously,
ushering into the dining-room an aged man, decked out in holly
and mistletoe.
"..Welcome, my dear old friend," said PETER, seizing the aged
man by the hand. "You have spent many a Christmas with us in
the past, may we have you here often in the future." j
"I am sure I have seen your face before, Sir," observed Uncle
JOHN, with great cordiality.
"I should think you have, Uncle," cried PETER. "Why, we are
inseparables. He is quite an enfant de la maison. Are you not,
my dear old friend?"
"Who is he'?" asked Aunt MARIA, in a whisper—all women are
curious. But what of that—bless them!
"I will tell you in a toast," returned PETER, again seizing the
holly-decked and mistletoed old man by the hand.
"Behold my alter ego. Yes, dear friend, we have been comrades
for many a long day. In you I hail the trusty guardian of
all I possess, from the scanty furniture of the garrets down to the
humble soup-kettle in the back-kitchen. Ladies and Gentlemen, 1
give you—' The Man in Possession!'"
And thus PETEK PLEASANT welcomed his Yule-tide Guest.

THANKS. Can't find it. And what is the matter with this ?—
"If the British Government should desire to send a purely friendly
and temporary Mission to this country, with a small escort not ex-
ceeding twenty or thirty members, similar to that which attended
the Russian Mission, this servant of God will not oppose its pro-
gress "? Is that meant to be nasty? Eh?
The V—y, Simla, to the E—lofB—nsf—d, Downing Street.
AWFULLY. Couldn't be worse. Veiled irony of Persian original
outrageous. If more comes in, what is to be done?

BETTER send on " Persian original" as it stands. Man here can
put it into decent English.
The V—y, Simla, to the E—l of B—nsf— d, Downing Street.
DECENT English not wanted. More indecent the better. Can't
come up to the original.
A GOOD REASON (by a Miso-Russ).—Why must Russia keep her
word? Because no one will take it.
BETTER THAN HARTTITOTON'S HALF-AND-HALF. — WHTMREAD'S

"Goon HF.AVENH, GIRLS! WHAT—WHAT DOES mis MEAN? A POST-CARD, ADDRESSED TO ONE OF YOU, AND ON IT I READ;

THE BENEFIT OF BOGEY.
To put brave JOHN BULL in the abjectest fright,
And confuse all his notions of reason and right,
There is nought like a Bogey. A palpable foe
Finds him steady and sure, if a little t>it slow;
But if you would drive the old boy off his head,
Just dress up a Bogey, in yellow or red,
With.a Moscov fur cap or a gay Gallic plume,
And at once he commences to nuster and fume:
A top-booted Ajax, at darkness takes fright,
Like a timorous child midst the terrors of night.
For your Bogey, a monster that's vaguely iniquitous,
Foggily frightful and dimly ubiquitous.
Pops up at all points like a turnip-faced ghost,
Which cunningly shifted may pass for a host.
The Muscovite Bogey is BDLL'.S latest scare,
It has fluttered his nerves, on an end set his hair,
And, managed adroitly by mischievous BEN,
Confounded that coolest and fairest of men.
Poor BULL! In his lunes he 'a the laughter of those
Who are not so soon gulled to take phantoms for foes.
BEN howls " Fi-fo-fum!" in true ogreish tones,
Thinks BULL, "Eugh! the Ghoul would be grinding my bones.'1
BEN gibbers and shrieks; says JOHN BULL. "By the rood,
The Monster is smelling an Englishman's blood.
Then he loses his head, with his clearness of sight,
And his common-sense judgment of wrong and of right.
And o'erlooking the peril that's under his nose,
Runs madly amuck against fear-fashioned foes,
And, aping the tricks he's so forward to blame,
Plays blindly, and badly, his enemy's game.
Meanwhile tne sly Bogey-Men smile at his scares,
Pick his pocket behind, misconduct his affairs,
To meet fancied dangers invite instant ills,
And leave BULL the fool's portion—big words and long bills.
Wake, JOHN! Take more accurate gauge of your foes!
The Bogey's big goggles and blood-painted nose
Are scare-crow devices. Look sharp, and fight fair,
Don't be driven to bully, nor shocked into scare,
Nor abuse the true friends who would bid you keep cool;
For the man who plays Bogeydom's game plays the fool!
DOGMA AND DRINK.
WHATEVER differences on dogma may exist between Roman
Catholics and Protestants, all sensible persons on either side are
likely to concur in the recommendation of "A Catholic Congress
just held at Brussels,"^viz., "the substitution of beer for spirits, as
more refreshing and less injurious."
This decree of a Catholic Congress on Beer only wants the confir-
mation of the POPK pronounced et cathedra to stamp it with in-
fallibility. Perhaps he will so stamp it, being himself a moderat«
man. In that case, would his Holiness be pleased to append to hi)
declaration, to make it the more gracious, the admonition— Quicunqte

SUPPOSING the following letters to have been received at the Punch Office
luring the past week, Punch feels he ought not to be restrained from publishing
them by any antediluvian considerations of respect for the Bench:—
i.
THE Lord Chief Justice of England will feel much obliged if Mr. Punch will
nform the world and Lord PENZANCE that his Lordship in his impertinent attack
on the L. C. J. (contained in his late remarks on the judgment of the Queen's Bench
Division in the case of Martin v. Mackonochie), has proceeded on an entirely
erroneous view of the law, as well as a gross misrepresentation of the facts.
ii.
LORD PENZANCE will thank Mr. Punch to inform the
Lord Chief Justice of England that he entertains the
prof oundest contempt for his opinions on Law in general,
and Ecclesiastical Law in particular, about which, as a
Common Law Judge, he can know nothing.
m.
THE Lord Chief Justice of England has only to add to
his previous communication that while he admits that
Lord PENZANCE, as a Common Law Judge, who has
undertaken the administration of a system of law of
which he can know nothing, should be a good authority
upon the question on which he presumes to pronounce in
his last communication, he_is compelled to repeat that
his Lordship is wholly mistaken as to his law, and
scandalously inaccurate as to his facts.
IV.
LORD PENZANCE has only to express his utter con-
tempt for the Lord Chief Justice of England.
v.
THE Lord Chief Justice can find no language in which
to express his admiration (?) for Lord PENZANCE.
VI.
LORD PENZANCE cares not the smallest coin of the
realm for lie Lord Chief Justice of England.
vn.
THE Lord Chief Justice of England cares less than the
smallest coin of the realm for Lord PENZANCE.
vm.
LORD PENZANCE wishes to put on record his conviction
that the Lord Chief Justice of England is a Person!
is.
THE Lord Chief Justice of England is glad to put in
plain terms his conclusion that Lord PENZANCE is another!

"Yes," repeats JOSSLYN, "that The Grange is haunted, is as
certain as that all the family have left the place."
Poor old Mrs. TUPTON begins fanning herself, as if she could keep
away Ghosts like flies. GOOL startles her by offering her jelly,
which, from its quivering, and its peculiarly pale colour, appears to
be as nervous as Mrs. TUPTON is herself.
"It may be a fact," says PELKIN WADD, ex-Master in Chancery,
"but who can vouch for it?"
"COTLEY'S people," answers DYKE, with conviction. "They 've
told me all about it."
Mrs. AYSFORD SYNOE remarks that for her part she doesn't believe
in Ghosts, but that The Grange has never been inhabited since
she was a girl; and, Miss SYNQE adds, that she never liked the look
of the place.
"It 's a matter of evidence," observes the ex-Master in Chancery,
sententiously.
"Quite," replies Mr. AYSFORD SYNGE, J.P. "But COTLEY'S gar-
dener and his wife came to me, and wanted to depose on oath to
•what they'd seen and heard at The Grange."
This arrests everybody's attention.
Mrs. TUPTON'S jelly remains on her plate untouched, still qui-
vering. She informs me, in a frightened whisper, behind her fan,
that if you once get her nephew JOSSLYN on this topic, he's some-
thing dreadful. Why," she adds, with a shiver, "he knows all
about the Ghosts all over the county, and likes them. Ugh! If they
go on talking like this, I 'm sure I shan't get any sleep to-night!"
In the gloom by the side-board I think I can just make out GOOL
smiling grimly.
"Who lives at The Grange now?" asks HOSHFOBD.
"A policeman and his wife," answers AYSFOKD SYSGE. "Their
married son stays at COTLEY'S, and keeps up the garden. The
family have all left."
"They're rent free, of course," observes the ex-Master in Chan-
cery, with a cynical smile.
Everyone resents this imputation; and Mr. AYSFORD SYNGE in-
forms the ex-Master, with some asperity, that he knows the police-
man, and his wife, and his son—that a more honest set does not
exist; and SANDILANDS corroborates the prevalent notion about The
Grange being haunted, by asserting that, for hit part, he (SANDI-
LANDS) wouldn't live there for a trifle. He adds, that, of course, he
doesn't believe in ghosts, yet he should object to a place with a
reputation for being haunted.
Everyone, except our host, chimes ia with this sentiment. Every-
one, except our host, professes to consider a belief in ghosts absurd,
but, on the other hand, no one would, as a matter of choice, prefer
residing in a haunted house.
"Then," says DYKE, quietly, "there's not much chance of letting
this."
"Why!" exclaims Mrs. LAWLEIGH BYBNE, beginning to draw on
her long gloves, "surely The Mote's not haunted I"
"Didn't you know that f" returns JOSSLYN, quite astonished
"Why, there's hardly a room in this old house without a legend.
And, adds JOSSLYN, with considerable pride, "I think HOSHFOHD
and SANDILANDS will bear me out as to the White Lady of The Mote
being as well authenticated a Ghost as any in the county."
HOSHFORD and SANDILANDS nod acquiescence in this statement;
and RENDLESHAM of Pikley—the crusty old man—turning to Mrs.
TUPTON, says,
You 're stopping here, Ma'am, aren't you?"
1 am, replies the poor old Lady, whose false front almost
'Yes
slides off her forehead with nervousness—" yes, I am; but," she
ies on piteously, "my nephew never said anything about it before,
ve only heard him sr^eak of Ghosts in other houses—not here."
"Oh, you won't see it, Aunt," says DYKE, consolingly.
"I don't like to talk about such things," she says, making a move,
which the Ladies take as a hint, and we all rise.
"You are staying here, too, says Mrs. LAWLEIGH BTRNE to me.
"I know I should be afraid of going about alone in this house. 1
have heard that the servants never stop hero long—but I didn't
know the reason. The SYNGKS have an old haunted tower in their
grounds. I shall get her to tell me all about it. I love ghost-
stories, when there's a good fire and lots of people."
This is the first time since our introduction that the "haughty
Beauty" has condescended to treat me on an equality with the
County people. The Ghost subjeet has done it. This is "the

"OH, YOU 'RE FOND OF DRAWING, ARE YOU? P'RAPS YOU 'D LIKE TO BE AN ARTIST 2"
"OH DEAR NO—I 'M GOINCl TO BE A GENTLEMAN!"
touch of nature" I was waiting for; and it has come with the
supernatural. In Ghost-land, Old County Families and No County
Families meet on common ground; though the idea is rather church-
yardy. However, one'a thoughts can't be lively, when such a topic
is under discussion.
Mrs. LAWLEIGH BYTKNE sweeps out of the room after the elder
Ladies, and followed by Miss SYNGE, who, as she disappears through
the dark oak door, in the old oak panel, with her yapoury dress,
long white neck, with a black band round it—reminding me of that
awful guillotined woman's story—with her pale face, strange melan-
choly eyes, and immaterial hair, might easily be mistaken for the
White Lady of The Mote, who had accepted an invitation, just for
once and away, and whose hour for professional haunting having
struck, was compelled, by her strict sense of duty, to vanish from
the festive scene.
The room has grown darker in consequence of some of the candles
in the old sconces haying burnt down, when they were silently extin-
guished by GOOL, while we were waiting upon the ladies' departure.
The gentlemen shuffle themselves into fresh} places, and, at Joss-
LYN'S suggestion, we form in front of the fire, each one selecting
a safe place for his wine-glass.
"I didn't want to frighten the ladies," says PELKIN WADD, the
ex-Master, who has hitherto posed as the sceptic of the party, "but I
know all about The Grange. COTLEY'S old gardener, who came to us
afterwards, had seen the ghost himself."
"Indeed!" I can't help exclaiming, being interested.
"Yes. He 's a sensible and sober old fellow is GADD, and he 's
told me of his having seen a figure at night digging in the garden.
And when he went up to it, it vanished."
This seems to everyone rather a tame conclusion to a ghost story
that had promised very well at the beginning. There's a general
impression—felt, not expressed—that we 're to have something•better,
from someone, presently.
HOSHFOHD also remembers having talked to the man who used to
live at The Grange before the Policeman and his wife went there.
"What did he say?" I ask.
"Well, the belief is that Cardinal POLE once lived in The Grange;
that he buried a large treasure..there,"and that 'it is his ghost that
haunts the place."
"And this man had seen him?" 1 inquire.
"Yes. He 'd seen something; and fie said he thought it must be
the Cardinal. So I asked him what the ghost was like; and he told
me that he was a little old man, with grey stockings, brown knee-
breeches, and buckles, a blue tailed coat, brass buttons, and an old-
fashioned wig, with a pig-tail. He felt sure it was Cardinal POLE,
he said, because of his dress."
We all smile, but have a slight suspicion that HOSHFOBD is turn-
ing the subject into ridicule. JOSSLYN DYKE says so plainly, and
remarks that though HOSHFOHD'S informant was of course wrong in
attempting to make this particular Ghost fit in with the tradition of
the place, yet it does not prove anything against his having seen
the Ghost of some one, though not of Cardinal POLE. "Besides,"—
DYKE puts this as an unanswerable climax,—"the Ghost never said
he was Cardinal POLE."
HOSHFOBD hastens to assure us that he, personally, believes in
Ghosts; that he knows several men who 've seen Ghosts; as also, it
appears, does every one present.
The general opinion appears to be that, on the whole, it is safer to
believe in Ghosts than not. It's more complimentary to the Ghosts,
of course, and, I'fancy, what we all feel about it is, that we would
rather assert our belief in Ghosts openly and boldly, so that should
any Ghost be listening, he would hear nothing said that might be
an inducement for him to catch any one of us alone, and frighten
the individual into fits, in order to prove his existence. Our un-
expressed formula about Ghosts seems to be: "We believe in
Ghosts, because we don't want to see any. If we said, 'We don't
believe in Ghosts,' then one of them, lurking about this old house
—and The Mote, to speak sportingly, is a most likely find for both
Ghosts, and rats—might catch us unawares, when the consequences
would, probably, be serious."
JOSSLYN DYKE doesn't like speaking of this subject before the
servants. He whispers to us that, after they 've served the coffee,
and withdrawn—he will, perhaps, tell us what he himself has fre-
quently seen in this very house, which would be quite enough to

Institute at St. James's Hall, Piccadilly, Admiral SEL-
WYN, in replying to the toast for the Navy, "suggested
that chemistry might yet give us a poisonous shell which,
if well placed, would decide the event of a naval combat."
A modern benefactor of his species is he who invents a
gun, a torpedo, or a shell which will destroy hundreds
and thousands at a blow. Whether the poisonous shell
which a beneficent chemistry may, as Actmiral SELWYN
says, yet give us, would be much of a blessing to a mari-
time countrv, and greatly help BRITANNIA to rule the
waves, may be queried; but, perhaps, the invention of a
wholesale annihilation-machine, rendering war too hor-
ribly ridiculous to be practicable, might well repay the
studies of a Christian philanthropist by enforcing peace
on earth, at least, if not promoting good-will.

DUE KEPKESENTATIVE MAN.
(Same account of Tom Tug and the Beggar's Opera at Covent
Garden last week.)
SIR,
I 'VE said it before, and I '11 say it again, "Don't tell me we
are not a musical people,"—I mean, at all events, a people fond of
music, and capable of appreciating every sort of music on its merits.
And, when we have established a favourite, don't we make much of
him? don't we make more and more of him? don't we—like the
process in the game of " thinking of a number "—don't we double
him, in encoring him, add ten to him, specially if he is already a
tenor, so that he can afterwards add a hundred to himself, then sub-
tract him from every one else and say, " He, and he only, is the man
for our money?" Of course we do.
That this is the public estimate of Mr. SIMS REEVES was proved to
demonstration by the appearance of Covent Garden on Tuesday night
last week, when, on the occasion of our great English Tenor playing
Captain Macheath in the Beggar's Opera, the nonse was literally
crammed, from floor to ceiling, by an audience whose enthusiastic
temperature increased in a graduated thermometrical scale, the
over-boiling point being reached at the back row of the Upper
Gallery; and this on a night when, in the stalls and boxes,
wrappers, fur mantles, and ulsters, were de rigueur, on account of de
rigour of the cold, and when the Messrs. GATTI might have made a
considerable addition to their good fortune, by sending round the
attendants with a supply of foot-warmers, hot toddy, and mulled
claret, and other popular drinks at cheap prices.
Everyone would have hailed with pleasure (apropos of "hailed,"it
snowed next day—but that isn't to the freezing point) the appearance
of these hot draughts, after suffering from such cold draughts as
abound, at all times, in this huge Covent Garden Theatre. ]
shivered for mvself; I trembled for SIMS REEVES, lest his delicate
throat—one of the most delicate, I believe, ever possessed by tenor-
should be affected by the severity of the weather, in which case an
apology would have to be made.
With commendable good taste Mr. HATES, the impressario on this
occasion, had closed the house on Monday, as a mark of respect to
the memory of the late Mr. GTE. Such a course was highly credit-
able, both to the impressario and Mr. REEVES. It wonld have beei
cruel if, after this loss of one night, the weather had preventec
Mr. REEVES from fulfilling his engagement. Fortunately he was
11 excellent spirits, in excellent voice, and played Macheath mag-
nificently.
There he was, bright and gay as ever, our tenner still unchanged,
and equal to any number of the most valuable notes.
En passant, the public has an idea that Mr. SIMS REEVES is "a
>ird wno can sing, and often, capriciously, "won't sing." Some
even go so far as to ask, "Can't he be made to sing'r No one
wishes more sincerely than himself, that, on the occasions when he
s forced to refuse, he could be "mode to sing." It is no pleasure
jo any man to lose money by being compelled to cancel an engage-
ment which is entered into on the play and pay principle, and it
cannot but be an unspeakable, or, in Ins case, an unsingable, disap-
wintment to thousands who "hang on his lips." It is no more a
ileasure for a distinguished tenor to be laid up with a bad throat,
han for a one-legged dancer, d la DONATO, to oe prostrated by the
jout in his one solitary foot. So much for Buckingham.
My only personal grievance against Mr. SIMS REEVES is, that he
ms a plural name—a double plural name; but this is my objection,
mly Salved, to any one called PHILLIPS, or EDWARDS, or ROBERTS.
They ought each to govern a plural verb. It should be grammatical
a say, PHILLIPS are coming to dinner. EDWAKDS are smoking.
PHILLIPS are fools," and so on.
Mr. SIMS REEVES, as a plural name, however, may be the excep-
tion to what should be the rule, on account of his singular ability.
And I don't think, that, without the final "s," "SIM REEVE"
would look well in an advertisement. Too late to change now; but I
;ake this opportunity of broaching the theory, that is, as it sims to
tie.
I heard him in The Waterman, when his rendering of " The Say
of Biscay" literally brought down the house, as it always will.
Madame CAVE-ASHTON was a charming Wilhelmina, and her
'Cherry Ripe" (introduced here simply, I suppose, for the reason
;hat the lady in question can sing it so well) was neartily encored.
By the way, the manner of introducing " The Bay of Biscay " is
lunny enough, and must have been fashioned on the model of the
;enor, who, insisting on singing "In my Cottage near a Wood" in
every piece, used to look round, see a table, hit it, exclaim, "All!
made of wood! that reminds me of My Cottage near a Wood!"
which was the cue for the orchestra to strike up the symphony to
ihat popular melody.
Mr. REEVES, being all alone, soliloquises about his stupid rival,
Robin the Gardener, and observes, "Ah, I should like to have seen
what sort of a figure he would have cut on board ship, in such a gale
as I was in, when last I crossed The Bay of Biscay 1"
Cue for band, "Bay of Biscay.'" and delight of audience,—but
Thomas Tug, the jolly young Waterman, has never been to sea in
his life, bless him! and knew nothing of the Bay of Biscay from
personal experience.
Let those who do not believe in a " comic tenor," see SIMS REEVES
as Captain Macheath, and they will then discover what magic there
is even in a refrain of" tol de rol, lol de rol loddu," when given by
a tenor who is not impressed by the absurd traditional notion that
he is nothing if not sentimental.
His acting of the celebrated song, "How happy would I be tcith
either," is full of humour, and his change of manner from " tol de
rol" in a tender tone when addressed to the gentle, confiding Polly,
to "tol de rol" with a true cockney chick-a-leary twang, when
addressed to the vulgar Lucy Lockitt. is a clever idea, most
artistically carried out; and then, his dance up the stage, while
singing, giving his last note, good and true to the end in spite of
this unaccustomed exertion, as, with a jump, he seats himself, in a
natural devil-may-care style, on the table, was followed by an
encore, so momentous, that even he, the determined anti-encoreist.
was fain to comply with the enthusiastic demand; so he repeated
the two verses, the dance, and the jump, with as much freshness and.
vigour as though he had not already sung six songs—snatches, more
or less, it is true—and had not got ten more to follow, with "Here's
to the Maiden of bashful fifteen," and a dance, by way of finale!
It was a treat. But what a stupid play! What a set of sordid,
squalid, ruffianly characters, all, except Polly Peachum, prettily
played by Madame CAVE-ASHTON, who obtained more than one
encore. The chorus of "Let us take the Road" was very effectively
given. I should like to see The Beggar's Opera with a well re-
modelled plot, an efficient cast, to include, of course, Mr. SIMS
REEVES (it would be nothing at all without his Captain Macheath)
and Madame CAVE-ASHTON, and produced under such careful stage-
management as was shown by Mr. HAEF, in bringing out Olivia at
the Court Theatre.
However, for the present, The Beggar's Opera, which, I believe,
was the result of u "onsiderable amount of collaboration," is, as
played the other night at Covent Garden, good enough, by way of a
musical treat, for YoTO KEPRESENTATITE.

BETWIXT PARPS AND CRACKERS.

COMES but once a year. _ Punch is
thankful for it. For Christmas has
taken to leaving so much pasteboard,
lliat should his fatherly visit como
twice a year Punch would have to
put up outside his door, as people do
after their wedding-advertisements,
"No cards."
The "Christmas Board " used to be
a favourite personification. It was in
the habit of groaning under roast beef,
turkey, and chine, mince-pie, and
plum-pudding. Now the " Christmas
Paste-Board" world seem a fitter em-
bodiment of the festive season; though
it should not be the "Paste-Board " that ought to groan, but those who have to
struggle against its ever-growing encroachments on our purses, and demands
on our admiration.
For this alarmingly increasing pack of Christmas cards has grown in quality
as much as in quantity. They are so pretty, it seems a shame to grumble at
them. Here is Punch bound to confess himself pleased, even while he protests
he can hardly hold his head above the rising tide of charming pictures that keeps
flowing in on him. First comes MARCUS WARD, who deals the trump-cards of
the Christmas pack, the most delicate and dainty in colour and design, whether
of arabesque, and flower, and winged thing of earth and air and fairy-land, or
graceful figure, or group in coquettish old world attire—an endless variety, on
the whole, in admirable taste; and—unexpected improvement—with verses
appended, which are not vulgar, or commonplace, but often as graceful and elegant
as the designs they accompany.
Then there is DE LA RUE, scarce a shade in elegance and variety behind
WABD, though Punch must protest, parenthetically, against nudities at Christ-
mas time. It is too cold for them, if there were no other reason. He sends a
greater variety of Christmas Gifts—not only Cards, but the daintiest Pocket-
Books and Diaries, with Russia bindings and perfumed pages, for pretty fingers
to record graceful items of girlish outlay, or tender memoranda, till Cupid gives
Elace to Hymen, and marriage brings house-bills ».nd domestic entries. And
jr these, too, DE LA RUE has fitting books of record; or, if we need more than
he can supply, is there not LETTS, with his large family of Diaries, ranging—
"fine by degrees and beautifully less"—from the folio giant of the desk to the
tiniest waistcoat-pocket companion? How record even by name the list of
other card-makers, who play off their Christmas showers on Punch's devoted
head—ACKERMANN, with his graceful groups of Cupidons at play, and ROTHE
with his flowers, and his series of picturesquely-
costumed Seasons, and PAYNE, the Aylesbury photo-
S-apher, whose specialty is nosegays from nature, and
ARDING with his sporting figures of the olden time, and
RniiiEL with his perfumed pack. In short, their name
is Legion.
And if we turn in despair from the rush and rain of
Cards, it is but to encounter the still more alarming raid
of the Cossacks, with Captain CABMAN in command, and
Lieutenant' Ton SMITH under him. As for Captain
CABMAN'S Cossacks, they betray their predatory habits
by their dress; like Falstaff's recruits, they seem to
have robbed heaven and earth, the present ana the past,
to fit them out. They even assume skins, and shells,
and feathers, spoils of birds, beasts,, and fishes; they
creep into boots, and curl up in baskets, and crouch in

cloak and grin from under Father Christmas's holly
wreath; and, Cossack-like, they carry as great a variety
of plunder in their pockets, as of clothes on their backs.
What between cards and crackers, Punch sits con-
founded, and can only cry out to his over-generous
Christmas contributors, "Hold! enough!"—and more
than enough by a great deal.
He has a waste-paper basket for superfluous corre-
spondence, but what waste-paper basket could accom-
modate this deluge of Christmas Cards and Crackers
—even were it in his heart to transfer such pretty
things to such a receptacle! Ha, a happy thought!
Suppose he passes the overflow on to the Children's
Hospitals!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

Y,
Dec. 16th.—
Amidst a
hush of sor-
row in the
House of
Commons reflecting the nation's sadness out of doors, the CHANCELLOR
of the EXCHEQUER moved, and the Marquis of HABTINGTON seconded,
in few and feeling words befitting the theme, an Address of Condo-
lence to the QUEEN on the death of the Princess ALICE.
Words could not fail the orators on such a text. They whose
duty it is to speak the general grief for this unlooked-for loss are
embarrassed in the choice of topics for their praise of one who was
the blessing of the home she left, and that to which she came, who
united all that is wise and gracious in crowned head with all thatjs
best and most loyeable in daughter, sister, wife, and mother. There
is only one feeling as strong as the nation's sorrow—its sympathy
with all who have lost her love, from the QUEEN at "Windsor, and
the widowed husband and motherless children in the darkened
Palace at Darmstadt, down to the humblest of those reached by her
wise and loving care about her German home.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, antedating the Christmas
Pantomimes after the fashion of the day, performed the favourite
trick of dropping the red-hot poker—the grant to the lihodope
sufferers serving capitally for Ipoker. The Opposition, naturally,
finding a poker within their reach, used it to poke their fun at the
Government, till Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE was fain to take shelter
from the heavy artillery of Mr. ANDERSON and Sir G. CAMPBELL,
and the livelier assaults of Sir W. HAKCOUET and Mr. CHAMBERLAIN,
behind Sir ROBERT PEEL.
Mr. STANHOPE then moved the resolution (already carried in the
Lords) for the Commons' sanction to the application of Indian reve-
nues to the Afghan War. The Act required, it—and the House, he
hoped, would award it. But such sanction would not preclude

[DECEMBER 28, 1878.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
future apportionment of the cost between Indian poverty and
Imperial wealth. The war was a little war now: if it grew, we
might spread the payment to meet the growth of its cost. All the
Government asked for at present was permission to put its hand into
India's pocket and take -what it wanted. There ought to be a Surplus
there—though it had come down by a million since last heard of—but
still there was enough to pay the money we were likely to want just
now, and something over for the Famine Insurance Fund, which the
Surplus had been raised to supply. He couldn't be bothered with
making the figures come right. All the House had to do was to
sanction their taking what Government wanted from India without
the bother of continual explanations to the House of Commons.
Mr. FAWCETT must continue to object. By the Ministerial case
the war was for Imperial, not Indian purposes, and the cost of
it should come out of JOHN BULL'S pocket, not poor half-starved
India's. The sanction asked for would give Government on un-
limited Vote of Credit on the Indian Revenue. They talked about
ultimate apportionment between English backs and Indian. The
House should have some assurance that there would be such an
apportionment, and on what principle it would be made.
Mr. GLADSTONE seconded the Amendment, and with Mr. LAING,
Sir G. CAMPBELL, Mr. O. Mono AN, and even such more scrupulous
supporters of the Government as Sir W. BAKTTELOT ana Mr.
HUBBARD, argued, as if the matter were not a foregone conclu-
sion, and to-morrow's one hundred and ten majority safe in the
Whip's pockets. But for decency's sake the CHANCELLOR of the
EXCHEQUER agreed to an adjournment of the debate.
Tuesday (Lords).—The Earl of BEACONSFIELD, in emphatic and
over-stilted terms, moved, and Earl GRANVILLE seconded, in better
taste, the Peers' Condolence to the QUEEN on the death of the
Princess ALICE.
Then their Lordships adjourned till Thursday, February 13.
Commons.—To a question from Mr. HUBBARD about the heavy cloud
of distress overlying the country, and the still blacker clouds looming
behind it, Mr. CROSS gave as comfortable on answer as could be
extracted from reports of the chief local authorities of Edinburgh,
Liverpool, and Manchester. The coal and iron districts have yet to
speak by their official mouths. Punch is glad to hear that Mr.
ScLATER-BooTii does not think the distress as yet so severe as \ti
require exceptional measures. For the present the Poor Law is
strong enough to meet the pull on the rates. Long may It continue
so, prays Punch, with a heavy heart. There would be more .comfort
in the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER'S assurance that the Goyern-
ment does not intend to guarantee a Turkish Loan without the
previous approval of Parliament, did not Punch feel that the
Government have onlv to ask our Parliament for approval of a
guarantee for a Turkish Loan, or anything else ther like, to get it.
Lord ELCHO suddenly sprung on the House the report of the
Rhodope Commission, twitting the Opposition with their silence
about the horrors therein revealed, as compared with their quick
susceptibility to the atrocities of the first Bulgarian massacres.
Mr. HERSCHELL deprecated the casting of aspetslons by either
side on the point of humanity, or the claim of a moiippoly for either
of sympathy with suffering, whether of Turks or Christians.
After an intimation from the CHANCELLOR, of the EXCHEQUER,
that the Government did not intend to lay before the House any
estimate of the expenses of the Afghan war, or any plan for its
apportionment between India and Britisli revenues, the debate on
Mr. STANHOPE'S Motion was resumed by Profesbor PLATI'AIR, who
dissected, with his keen Scotch scalpel, the question, first, of the
character of the war—whether Imperial or Indian—and next, of the
sufficiency of the Indian Surplus to bear its cost thus far. Till last
week, it was a war of the Cabinet; now, by vote of a majoritvof the
House, it had become a war of Imperial policy. The shrunk Surplus
of a million and a half of Indian revenue was a Famine Insurance
fund, which we could not touch without breaking faith with the
poor people of India. There was greater danger to India in the
pressure of increased taxation, than in the shadowy Muscovite
Spectre, seen, or supposed to be seen, over the mountains of
Afghanistan, but, in sober earnestness, as unreal as the Spectre of
the Brocken. The English people had returned a majority to
support the spirited Foreign policy of the Government. The war
was a part of that policy. Ergo, the English people ought to hear
the cost of it.
Lord G. HAMILTON made effective use of his lately-acquired office
knowledge of Indian matters to argue that the war was an Indian
war, and that Indian revenue was strong enough to bear its burden.
In proof whereof he daringly rushed into the tangle of figures out of
which Mr. STANHOPE had prudently retreated.
Mr. Punch can only say he remains perfectly in the dark as to
the real amount of Surplus available for the war, without trench-
ing on the Famine Fund; but, so far as he can make out, if you
diminish that fund one-half, and increase the Surplus by about as
much, you may have a million to play with.
Sir H. JAMES came down heavily, as usual, on the ATTORNEY-
GENEKAL, and gave an able lawyer's reasons in favour of Mr. GLAD-
STONE'S view that Government are breaking the Act of 1858 in
taking Indian revenues to pay for war beyond British India without
previous consent of Parliament. The SoLiciioK-GEifEKAi. put in a
lawyer's plea for the opposite opinion.
Sir G. BALFOUH gave a military economist's, Sir. "W. Liwsoif,
a humanitarian humorist's, Mr. NEWDEGATE, a conscientious
Constitutionalist's, Mr. MUNDELLA, an intelligent employer's, and
Mr. GUILDERS an able ex-official's reasons against the Government
proposal.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER summed up by a reiteration
of the legality and necessity of all that had been done, and of the
Government's distinct refusal to saddle England with any part of i
the cost of this war. as a matter of expediency, still less of right, j
It might turn out to be a little war—a clash of iron pot with pipkin—
in which case India could pay for it, and ought to pay for it. It ,
might turn out a big war—a serious collision of iron POT with POT;
and then England might contribute to the cost in her great good- <
ness, but only by a vote in aid of the Indian Government.
After a reminder from the Marquis of HAB.TINOTON that in this'
way the power of the House to control questions of peace and war
was brought to nought, and its duty to protect the purse of the
British tax-payer made a mockery, and a protest from Mr. JACOB
BRIGHT against this mode of disposing of the Indian Surplus—if
any—the House divided, 125 for, and 235 against, Mr. FAWCETT'S
Amendment, giving the Government a majority of 110 for taking
the cost of the war out of Indian pockets.
And then the House adjourned till Feburuary 13th, with the •.

IN MEMORIAM.
Jlite of ireat Jriiam,
GRAND DUCHESS OF HKSSE-DARM8TADT.
Boax, APRIL 25, 1843. DIED, DECEMBER 14, 1878.
THRONKS stand apart, their lives that sit thereon
Fenced in with forms, by ceretaony barred
From common converse with plain truths, and lone,
Though in full light of all the world's regard.
Sad lives were theirs in Such high slavery bound,
But for the love that will not be denied
Its way to human, hearts, though, robed and crowned,
Their owners sit apart in sceptred pride.
For Kings and Queens are men and women too,
And palaces are homes, on which descend
The blessings that well-governed homes ensue,
The curses that on ill-ruled homes attend.
Our QUEEN among all Queens this truth has known,
And made us know it, for her country's cheer;
Best-ruled of English homes in hers has shown,
Till, from the highest to the humblest here,
England has joyed her joy and grieved her grief,
Prayed at her side by her good husband's bed,
And when Heaven sent the woe beyond relief,
Our hearts, that could not comfort, for her bled.
"We knew such light was round that darkened throne
As comes from children's love and widow's faith;
And most we heard and blest the name of one
Whose heart showed firmest by that bed of death.
One sweet face earliest at the sufferer's side,
Latest to seek the rest that love gainsays;
One weakness still the stronger the more tried,
One yearning look that met his latest gaze.—
And when fond daughter was made loving wife,
And carried to her home beyond the sea
England's God-speed, we joyed to learn her life
Was all a life so disciplined should be.
As wife, as mother, and as sovereign there
She lived by the example set her here;
Sowing all round the seed that fruit must bear
Of blessedness, far on, from year to year.
When joy and sorrow wove into her lot
Their weft of bright and black, we noted still
How joy into o'erweening raised her not,
How sorrow wrung no murmur at Heaven's will.—
Just seventeen years since then, and as our Queen
Touched the dark threshold of her day of woe,
Still in that memory of love kept green,
Lo, now, she, too, hath gone—where all must go,
Princes and subjects—gone, so young, to rest;
Gone from the home she loved, the children fair
She reared as she was reared, the land she blessed,
The wise good works whereof she made her care.
So fair, so young, so good, so much well done
Of life's best wonk, so much left still to do:
Sweet soul—with all those crowns so early won,
There needed not the mother-martyr 'stool
Her death was such as such a life should find,—
A death in love, caught from her boy's dear lips.
Sorrow is well for those she leaves behind
In sudden darkness of this swift eclipse,
But not for her, she is where love sits crowned
Upon the Throne, has reached the shining shore:
Is with the sire in whom her heart was bound,
Is with the babes she finds to lose no more.

Candidates inquiring as to the mode of conferring Musical Honours
at the University are informed that the ceremony consists in their
being invited, after dinner, to drink the health of their Professor,
Dr. G. A. MACFARREN, proposed by the Vice-Chairman, Dr. ARTHUR
SULLIVAN (Chevalier of the Legion of Honours Easy), finishing up
with " He s A Jolly Good Fellow," which is the harmony of the
evening, arranged for eight voices, every one on his legs, if possible.
The ancient versicle [Cantabile apud Cantabs), announcing the
Musical Honours is generally used, "Hie enitn est jucundus et
bonus Socius," with the graceful Academical response, "Et sic
dicimus omnes!"
The Vice-Chairman subsequently retires to rest, preceded by the
Boots bearing the usual Silver Candlestick, which is removed by the
same official on the Composer's composing himself to sleep, as he
sings to himself the soothing refrain, " Quod nemo negare potest."

ghosts.
GOOT. had been keeping the door open with one hand, so as to give
free passage to the servants.
GOOL himself now follows handing the liqueurs.
Happy Thought. Spirits—no Ghosts.
Conversation languishes during the ceremony of helping ourselves
to coffee. JOSSLYN DYKE motioning us to silence. We are all
longing to continue the conversation about ghosts, specially to hear
JOSSLYN DYKE'S own experiences in this very house, the old Mote;
but he puts his finger to nis lips, as though saying, Not before the
Boy—I mean—Not before the Butler."
Servants must feel rather awkward during the dead silence.
GOOL doesn't. He seldom speaks unless addressed by someone.
In fact, the Phantom Butler himself might be described as a Mute in
attendance on a Dead Silence.
Usually, GOOL floats or glides out of a room. But now, when we
all have our eyes on the door, which is held open for him by a servant,
in return for WOOL'S previous courtesy, we Bee the Phantom Butler
actually walk out, as solemnly, but as really as Hamlet's father's
ghost does on the stage,—that particular ghost is usually a very
heavy and very human person, with a sonorous voice,—and so 3
GOOL came in like a Ghost, at all events; he goes out like a Butler.
This sounds like a proverb—"To come in like a Ghost, and go out
like a Butler."
The room is gloomy, so many of the candles having guttered down
and been extinguished.
In the dark recesses, the shadows are listening,—cold shadows far
away from the fire.
In the robes of some of the portraits on the walls suddenly appear
grotesque faces, formed by the pleats and the folds. We point these
out to one another in an undertone, and everyone says, "Odd!"
JOSSLYN DYKE alone seems to think nothing odd in his house that
is at all goblinesque in character. In his opinion The Mote is the
very place for ghosts and goblins; and he wouldn't keep it a day, at
least, so it seems, were he not sure of the place being full of them.
Someone remarks that if there are not ghosts here, at all events,
there are rats in the wainscot.
JOSSLYN quietly returns, that for his part he likes rats in the wain-
scot. He also likes ghosts; the ghost not in the wainscot. Both in
their proper places.
In a second we are back "to our muttons "—that is, to our ghosts.
JOSSLYN wishes to reserve his evidence until the others have given
theirs: whereupon PELKIN WADD, the ex-Master of Chancery, volun-
teers an account of a friend of his, whose daughter saw an old man,
in a fur cloak, sitting on a box in a room at the top of their house.
She recognised him as a friend of the family who had gone to New
York, or somewhere; at all events he was the last person she would
have expected to find sitting in a box-room at the top of the house.
We quite agree that this is extraordinary in itself, as such a pro-
ceeding woula be absurdly eccentric on the part of any friend of any
family.
"What did she do? "I ask.
"She went down-stairs," answers PELKIN WADD, very slowly,
as though he were on his oath and paying the greatest attention
to details, "called her mother, and said, 'Oh, Mamma, I 'm so
frightened! There's Mr. WADDILOVE, in a fur cloak, sitting on a
trunk in the box-room!' "I
We are breathless.
PELKIN WADD continues, "She said, 'Oh, nonsense! it can't be!'
but her daughter insisted on her accompanying her np-stairs. So
up they went, opened the door"
"Yes," we all say—all except JOSSLYN DYKE—bending for wafd
eagerly.
"And —could see nothing. The ghost in the fur cloak had
vanished."
We are all dissatisfied.
"Might have been a burglar," remarks SANDILANDS. 4
No, no, we won't have any such commonplace explanation a& that.
Besides, do burglars go about in fur cloaks, and sit quietly on boxes P
SANDLLANDS retorts, "Yes: why not, when they've nothing else
to do?"
PELKIN WADD wishes to add the finish to his story.
"A letter came, some time after," he recommences—(Ah! now

NAG! Nag! Na?!
There is nought but nagging now;
The general tongue seems to spitefully wag
To the tune of Unlimited Row.
For the Outs they nag the Ins,
And the Ins they nag the Outs;
The man who loses nags him who wins;
When the loser stops nagging the winner begins,
And 'tis cocking of noses and lifting of chins,
And changing of buffets and flouts.
Grim GLADSTONE nags the Earl,
And the Earl nags W. G.,
"With the temper and taste of two roughs o'er their purl,
Or a brace of old vixens at tea.
And Rad nags Tory, and Tory Had;
And Cad nags Swell, and Swell nags Cad;
Poet nags Poet, as hound bays hound,
And the Parsons nag at each other all round.
The Critic sublime, with a temper short,
The Artist nags in right Billingsgate sort;
And the Artist nags back, in open Court,
In a fashion that giveth the groundlings sport,
And maketh the Cynic grin.
Nag! Nag! Nag! Nag!
There is never an end to the din.
And now, alas! the contagion spreads
To the biggest-wigged of the big-wigged heads:
Law's Top Lights join in the wordy fray,
And nag each other in such a fashion,
It puzzles the weary observer to say
Which Light may boast
That he nags the most
Like a grumpy old girl in a passion.
Oh, angry Goodies of either sex,
Invective's vocables cease to vex
With such misapplication;
Your slang-whang rivalries much perplex
A squabble-sickened nation.
Are tact and taste and good-temper fled 'r1
Politeness vanished, and patience dead?
Sage's tantrums and Statesmen's titt's,
Bards indulging in sneers and sniffs,
Judges burning the midnight oil
To point and sharpen, with petty toil,
Tiny dartlets of puny spite—
Bah! 'tis a paltry and piteous sight,
And makes one wonder, now and then,
What has become of alt the Men f
When female tongues in wrath are wagging,
Reason weakens as words grow strong,—
But now the favourite Gentleman's song-
Would seem " We 're all a-nagging!"
we 're going to have the real point!)—" from New York, saying, that
at such a time and on such a day, Mr. WADDILOVE died; and.
on comparing dates, the moment of his decease exactly corresponded
with the time of the apparition. I don't attempt to explain this
sort of thing," says PELKIN WADD, mysteriously; "I only tell you
what was told me on really unimpeachable authority."
During the discussion that follows PuLKUf WADD 'a narrative,
I try to think of a ghost-story—a first-rate one—told'me by the
very man himself, who had seen the ghost, with the names, dates,
places, and everything as clear as daylight; and himself, the narrator,
a public character, above fear, and of irreproachable morality.
Dear me! What was his name? I feel it is no use beginning the
story, unless I can give his name; and I can't, for the life of me,
recall it at this moment. I shall probably remember it to-morrow,
when I am miles away from the present party. Still, if I could but
remember the story note, it is so good, so convincing, and would be
presented on .such evidence, that I am sure I should dwell in the
grateful remembrance of everyone, as the raconteur of the marvellous
story of.this evening. And as I am only second-hand with this storv,
having received it directly from the person to whom it occurred,
any one wishing to treat his friends to such a story, would naturally
send for me. In fact, it is one of those stories, which is a little
fortune in itself to diners-out. It is far better than a humorous
story, as the interest depends on getting it first-hand, if possible,
but if not, at all events second-hand; while a humorous story may
be all the better for the little embellishments and additions of various
witty raconteurs: truth, in the latter case, being no object.
I do wish I could remember my story.
HOSHFORD tells us about what he himself saw when he was sleeping
in some old manor house.
"I woke up," he declares, " and saw as clearly as I see you "—this
he addressed to PELKIN WABD, who is a very evident object—" a
woman in a sort of white dress, and without a nead."
This does startle us. Without a head! We all \mconsciously
move our chairs nearer the fire, and the shadows seem to be creep-
ing slowly up towards us out of the recesses. Looking nervously
behind me, it seems that we are at this moment only separated by
the dining-table from the shadows.
"But, says SANDILANDS, "you were dreaming."
We all wisn to force HOSHFORD into allowing that he doesn't know
whether he was dreaming or waking- He won't alter a single item
of his story. He says in effect you can take it or leave it. There it
is, swallow it, or don't swallow it. I should like to suggest the
explanation, that it was somebody who had lost her head, and
wandered into his room; but I know JOSSLTM DYKE would set
this down to sneering or trifling, while really it is only due to
nervousness.
"I tell you," he affirms with evident conviction, "that I saw a
Headless Woman standing at the foot of my bed, as clearly as I see
anyone in this room."
Jossirir observes calmly. "Certainly. Why not?"
We are all silent. Why shouldn't HOSHFORD see a Headless
Woman? No: no one can state any just cause or impediment. I
am still trying to remember my story. I don't like to say "I've
got such a capital ghost-story it I could only recollect it." That's
the truth; but I must be silent, as truth is not to be told at all times.
Then JOSSLYN, being asked to give some account of The Mote, begins
by saying, "Well, I am not fond of talking about it "—this sounds as
though he were on intimate terms with the ghosts, and didn't like to
betray their secrets.

A NEW IDEA.
DEAR MB. PUNCH,
You can't think how awfully tired some of us
boys are getting of parties. What's the good of a con-
juror when we may see MASKELYNE AND COOKE any day,
besides lots of Pantomimes? Then it's an awful bore to
dance with the little girls, and at one's own house they
make one take all that can't get partners. If two or
three fellows do get together, and have a wrestling match
or anything rational, there's sure to be a row about it.
Now, Mr. jPtweA, I tell you what I want, and that is to
have some little beggars who have never been to a Christ-
mas Party in their lives, and give them what somebody
calls a new sensation. I don't mean real beggars, you
know.—there's plenty of Board School children who
would do well enough. And I don't mean a school feast
either, with tea handed round in watering-cans, and
stodgy cake, and the school-master hoping the children are
"grateful to their benefactors," and all that bosh. No, I
want to have lots of real cake and bread and butter, and
I should not mind a Christmas tree, or bran tub (only I
should like to buy the things at some of those beggarly
little shops where they never get a customer). After tea.
we could let the girls dance, if they liked it, and, would
not one of the street barrel-organ fellows like to come in
and play! And, to wind up, you, dear Mr. Punch, could
call round yourself, and wouldn't that be a lark!
Do persuade mother to let us have this party. She
says, there are the carpets." So there are. but she
takes them up for her ball, and so she might for mine.

"There's not a room in the house," he goes on deliberately, "that
isn't haunted. I don't .wish," he interrupts himself to say, turning
to me; "1 don't wish you to repeat this to my Aunt, or she
would be frightened into fits, and wouldn't get a wink of sleep all
night."
I intimate that on no account would I mention the subject to his
Aunt, Mrs. TCPTON; and of course I feel bound to accept as a com-
pliment the fact of his confiding the ghost-stories of The Mote to me,
as much as to imply that / am dauntless, and my repose not to be
disturbed by a thousand ghosts.
I wish I could recollect my story of my friend who saw a ghost.
I can't even recollect his name; and its credit depends on his per-
sonal authority. It's better than anything I have heard yet—ex-
cept, perhaps, HOSHFOHD'S, about the Headless Woman—which was
first hand. I remark, however, curiously enough, that the general
tendency is to give implicit credit to second-hand stories, but to
question the good faith of anyone who relates something marvellous
that happened to himself. In fact, on our quitting the room, I over-
hear AYSFORD SINGE asking SANDILANDS what the latter had
thought of HOSH FORD'S story, and receiving the curt reply that in
his (SANDILAND'S) opinion, HOSIIFORD was screwed and didn't
know what he was talking about." How much better HOSHFORD'S
story will come out when he himself isn't present. I shall tell it
myself, if I can recollect it, and, of course, shall add that the man
to whom it happened was as sober as a judge on the bench, and one
of the most sensible men I 've ever met.
JOSSLYN DYKE informs us, that " There is one room in the house —
he would rather not mention which—where the wicked old lord, the
Earl of DEPFOED—was murdered. The assassins, it was supposed,
entered either through a panel or from behind the bed; and after the
deed, they managed to conceal the body in a closet, where it was
found some months afterwards. The figure of the old Earl is seen,
points to the wounds with one hand, and with the other to a dark
mark on the wall, where it is supposed he had secreted some impor-
tant papers. These have never been found."
"Have you ever seen the ghost—yourself?" I ask, for I don't
like to inquire if I am to sleep in the haunted chamber: and if I can
get him to start a good long ghost-story, it will give me time to
remember mine. Also I feel that if I can only tell a ghost-story
myself, I shall be less nervous.
"Oh dear! yes," replies JOSSLYN, "often."
Silence. We regard one another. JOSSLYN is perfectly sober, at
all events. On the other hand, he is our host, and no one likes to
question or contradict him.
"Isn't there a room here that hasn't been opened for centuries?"
asks PELKIN WADD.
"Yes," replies JOSSLYN; "but the door is concealed, and we 've
never been able to discover it. But what I 've seen in this very room
where we are now sitting," he says, impressively, "would"
Here he pauses.—So do I!

THE PARSON'S GRATE.
(A Christmas (Fire) Box for all Mr. Punch's Readers.)
MB. MECHI has long been known as a liberal dispenser of the
light derived from his own useful experiences as a farmer, crop-
grower, stock-breeder, stock-feeder, and in many other capacities.
He now comes forward as a source of heat, as well as light, in his
enthusiastic circular of what he calls the Parson's Grate.
This grate is a long, deep, but narrow trough, with fire-brick
ends, back, and floor; the front is an iron hurdle, having from six
to ten bars of round iron 7-16ths of an inch thick1, with intervals of
li inches. A trough 16 inches deep and 14 inches wide will heat a
full-sized room, containing 450 superficial feet. The interior of the
grate is only 44 inches from back to front at its base, and 5J inches
at the level of the top bar. This thin stratum of coal permits the
air, which enters only through the front bars, to circulate freely
between the coals, and thus causes perfect combustion.
Except when fitted to previous register stoves, the Tfloor of the
grate is level with the floor of the room; when applied to existing
stoves, the trough is fitted into the grate.
Mr. MECHI tells us, as a proof of the discontent with our present
system of wanning, falsely so called, that he has received in ten
days more than 1,000 letters, complaining of insufficient warming,
and requesting instructions for constructing the model.
He suggests that these grates are specially fitted for railway-sta-
tions, board-schools, and other rooms of large area. They can be inex-
pensively adapted either to the agricultural labourer's cottage or to
houses of higher pretensions. He speaks from more than twelve
months' experience of their use. For a room 30 feet by 20, a grate
24 inches wide and 14 inches high would give, he says, a superabund-
ance of heat, and its cost including the setting, need not exceed
about £3. If required for richly furnished rooms the ornamentation
can be costly, according to desire. At present our railway-stations
are cheerless in winter. As for our living-rooms, the heat from the
common grate is carried up the chimney instead of being diffused in
the room.
The Parson's Grate dries and expands the air in the room, so that
one feels warm all over, and, under its influence, the floor is the
wannest part of the room, instead of (as at present) the coldest.
Kettles and saucepans, he says, will boil almost as quick on trivets
in front of the Parson's Grate as on the top; and as to.toast!
A lady friend of Mr. MECHI'S said to him:—" I cannot make toast
at any one of my strong drawing register stoves, but have to go to
the Kitchen Grate." He reminds us that there are nearly Ten
Millions of Fire Grates in the United Kingdom on wrong principles.
"If so," as he naturally soliloquises, "what a scope for reform f"
One never comes to an end of the blessings of the Parson's Grate.
In it the fire may be left without attention for four or five hours.
In fact, it is not uncommon to find fire lit in it overnight still burning
in the morning.
It requires very little poking.
Smoke from the coal burnt in it is converted into flaming gas. In
)';icl, it first produces flame, then coke, and then burns the coke to
an incombustible ash. It does away with smoky chimneys, and
releases chimney-sweepers from their dirty and degrading occu-
pation.
In short, before this wonderful grate, contrived, one would say,
for poor Parsons, and so appropriately christened after them, and
Mr. MEcnr ready to send instructions for its construction, if accom-
panied (as contributions to Mr. Punch should be), by a postage-
stamp, Mr, Punch can only say to the Parsons—who may be pre-
sumed to understand Latin—
"Felices illinium, sua si bona uflrint."

Will a war be commenced, or
a secret agreement, involving
tremendous consequences, con-
cluded, without the knowledge
and consent of the Parliament
and the People; and will the
previous sanction of the Legisla-
ture still be indispensable for the abolition of aT/Turnpike Trust, or the repairs of

Will Mr. GLADSTONE return to,power and cut down abuses instead of trees;
or will he retire from public life altogether and (politically)

Will Cleopatra's Xeedle be all the better for a year's
acquaintance with the clear atmosphere and bright
blue skies of the Thames Embankment?
Will the Right and the Left in the House of Commons
remain as they are, or will they change benches?
Will the Liberals still start three Candidates to struggle
for one seat (against a single Tory); and will they con-
tinue to resist cohesion as a party, because they are nut
all agreed about Public-houses, or Primogeniture, or
Prebendaries?
Will the Education of poor neglected children still be
a bone of contention, to be growled and fought over by
Church and Chapel?
Will the Opera House on the Embankment be finished?
Will Gas Lamps be as Oil Lamps, and Electric Lamps
as Gas Lamps:
Will there be Scientific Instruments invented, enabling
us to see our friends and relations at the Antipodes?
Will there be a Sea Serpent on view at one of the
Aquariums?
Will there be a good Grouse and Partridge Season?
Will there be a General Election?
Will there be a revival of commerce and cheerfulness,
tranquillity and trade, peace and prosperity, exports and
imports; and will there be more activity in the Home-
Office, and less in the Foreign and India '(
Will there be an immortal Poem or Novel written?
Will there be,' a new out-door Game thought out, to
supersede Lawn Tennis, as Lawn Tennis has superseded
Croquet?
Will there be anything fresh discovered about SHAK-
SPEARK?
Will the Public be on better terms with their fish-

PHEUOH! Bedlam in a belfry! Bless the boys!
You '11 frighten the New Year with all this noisi'.
Ring out, wild bells! But, oh! not in this fashion,
Like demon tongues the clappers clang and clash on
Sans time or tune,
About your ears you '11 bring the belfry soon!
The bells all cracked, the pullers in a passion.
Stop! Stop, my lads, take breath, and slacken rope!
You do not call this chiming, I should hope?
'Tis but a mad and maddening Charivari,
Enough to raise Old HARRY.
The cymbals of the Corybantes clashing,
Ne'er made such harsh and inharmonious crashing
As your cacophonous Carillon. Ring in
The New Year with this dismal deafening din ?—
Ah! ab&it omen!
You tug, and twist, and strain, like frantic foemen,
Not a right belfry-brotherhood of ringers.
Can such wild bells be bringers
Of benediction to a listening land?
BEN, hold that reckless hand,
And WILL, pull not so wildly; don't you see
Your crashing discords murder harmony,
And give the cue to Chaos? Sturdy JOHN,
All heedless of the score, may still tug on,
At the old well-worn rope. JOHN BULL has grown
A-weary of thy mellow monotone—
Which tells of times and tunes that used to be.
His rival there is pulling strenuously:
But an alarum, or a rataplan,
Seems his sole notion of bell-music. Hush!
Confound the man!
And now there's COCKBURN at it with a rush;
He should know better, so should that PENZANCE,
Than follow the wild dance.
And you, JOHN FORS, and JAMES, the Whistler smart,
Ought to know better how to play your part.
You may like different tunes; but anyhow
There 's neither art nor harmony in Row!

For independence harsh and absolute,
You 'd better far be mute.
Stop all of you, I say, and do try whutlirr
You cannot pull in tune and time together;
Your mad spasmodic tuggings in blind auger,
Result in naught but a demoniac clangour,
Which deafens, not delights, shakes tower and steeple,
And sorely shocks and mystifies the people.
Start fresh, my lads! together set your bells,
And with a peal that tuneful sinks and swells
Ring in the young New Year!
Only too many Candidates for the Throne of Cabul.
YAKOOB KHAN, MOHAMED IBRAHIM, SHARIF KHAN, JALALUDEEN
KHAN, AHMAD KHAN! A mere embarras d'Ameen!
"How happy could we be with any,
"Were t'other dear claimants away."

on the Interior of Afghanistan. How he must regret that he cannot
use the paternal title, What Will He do With It?

GREETINGS FOR THE NEW YEAR.
General Pipeclay. Afghan campaign,
Eh? U'm, so far they might have done
worse, considering they 've all Company-
officers in command! With the old and
experienced Queen's officers they have
ready to hand at home too! It's suicidal,
Sir. But if they like to cut their own
throats instead of the enemies,"
Admiral States. New Year's Day, and
we are not bombarding Cronstadt! Service
has gone—you know where.
Lieutenant Easy, R.N. Yes, a naval
campaign would have been all very jolly.
Awful bore to lose one's hunting, though.
Mr. Screicman (Manufacturer). Deuced
hard times, Sir. Give you my word, a man
must think twice before he opens a bottle
of Lafitte or Pommerv tres sec.
John Jones (Labourer). Drat them
Unions! Fourteen shillings a week was
better than starving on strike. I've as
good as forgotten the taste of beef, beer,
and baccy.
Mr. Sung (Licensed Victualler). Awful
times! Haven't sent away a customer with
what you could call a skinful this fortnight
past.
Voices from a Certain House (of Talk).
Spirited foreign policy! That 'a your game!
And as many millions as the Government
like to ask for. Hear, hear!
Voices from Another House (of Work).
There 'a a precious lot of us already, and
more coming. Where '11 they put us all, I
wonder, if things gets wus'?
Everybody to Mr. Punch. Oh, please,
Mr. Punch, here's another awfully black-
looking New Year! What are we to do?
Mr. Punch to Everybody. Keep up your
spirits, my friends! Better sense, better
luck, better trade, and better times coming
—let us hope.
A FIEND IN HUMAN SHAPE.
"BEG PARDON, SIR! BUT I'VE JUST CAUGHT THESE TWO YOUNQ RASCALS MAKING A
SLIDE IN FRONT OF TOUR DOORSTF.P, AND THEY SAT AS YOU GAVE 'EM PERMISSION!'
"IT'S QUITE CORRECT. I DID, POLICEMAN. THE FACT IS, I EXPECT MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
TO LUNCHEON!"
A STANDING EVIL TO BE COUNTERACTED.
DE A. W. EDH, who has already written to the Times, on the cruelty of keeping shop-
girls on their feet from the beginning to the end of their long day's work, has now pub-
fished proof of the prevalence and cruelty of the practice m a pamphlet, under the
auspices of the National Health Society. 44, Berners Street. Punch commends this pamphlet
to the perusal of all humane and sensible employers of shopwomen, and all Lady-customers
of shops in -which women serve. .. , .
They could do much by preferring those shops m which provision is made to enable Uieir
hard-worked shopwomen to enjoy a snatch of rest in a moment of leisure, and letting it be
known why they prefer them. Casteris paribus, these are likely to be the shops m whicn
they will be best served. Dr. EDIS'S pamphlet gives all needful information how counter-
seats may be and have been cpntrived, Punch is glad to say, by many thoughtful employers,
at little cost, and no inconvenience.
The Ladies should not sit down content till the poor shopgirls can sit down too.
NOT " UNIVERSAL AS THE SUN."
AN old reading—so old that Punch had
hoped it was obsolete—and a new applica-
tion of the burden of blessing from the
Angels' Christmas Song. "Peace on Earth,
Goodwill towards Men, comes to us from
the columns of the Manchester Exa-
miner :—
"A staunch Conservative and Churchman,
having arranged with Mr. BEN BHIBRLEY and
others to give a Christmas entertainment on
behalf of the poor in one of the outlying parishes
of Manchester, applied to the rector for the use
of the Church schools on the occasion. The fol-
lowing is an extract from the Eer. Gentleman's
reply :—
"' I have many reasoas why I cannot fall in
with your request for the entertainment. I do
not think a Church School ought to be used for
feasting the aged members of Roman Catholics,
Unitarians, and others, who are diametrically
opposed to us both in religion and politics.'"
Probably this Reverend Gentleman adopts
the Vulgate version of the text which confines
the " Peace on Earth." to " Men of Good-
will," and understands by "Men of Good-
will," men of his own way of thinking.
Church charity, in his view, ought to end,
as well as begin, at home.
Happily this reading of the angelic burden
of the Christian Christmas Song is as rare as
it is restrictive. Punch notes it as a special
rarity in Manchester, with its large-hearted
and large-brained Bishop, and its liberal re-
cord of gifts and labours in aid of the poor
and suffering at this time of trial, which fills
columns of the same journal that makes
public this unique utterance of uncharitable
exclusiveness.

Being a Brief Record of a few Winter-seasonable Visits to certain

VISIT THE FIRST.—CHAPTER VIII.
Josilyn's Experience—Inquiry—A nxiety—Disappointment— Ghosts
in the Drawing-Room—Mrs. Tupton's Fright—Departure—My
Unremembered Story—To Bed—Up-stairs—Retracing—The
Clock—The Old Legends of the House—But What Next?
WE are listening for what JOSSLYN is going to tell us about his
own experience of Ghosts in this house.
He considers, then continues: "Well, I was sitting here one even-
ing, about five o'clock, in the winter, when from that corner"—
pointing to a dark recess between window and door, which we all
regard intently, then murmur "Yes," whereupon he resumes in a
measured tone, with his eyes fixed on that spot—" from that corner,
there seemed to come an icy cold blast, not blowing strongly, but
like a draught through a small ventilator. In fact, I cannot
describe to you the strange sensation which seemed to take pos-
session of me at that moment. I am not at all nervous, and I
walked up to the corner in order to examine the place."
It occurs to me how nervous / should have been in such a
situation. Enough to make one's hair turn white. I do not utter
this observation aloud, but only smile approvingly, as though to
convey the idea of my perfect approbation of his conduct in such
trying circumstances, and wish him to understand that, of course,
any one of us here, especially myself, would have behaved in
precisely the same courageous manner.
"I tapped the wall," continues JOSSLYN, "and looked every-
where; there was no crack, no opening; but the strange, chill
draught continued; and, as I returned to my chair, I heard a step
following me, close at my heels. I turned round. There was no-
body!"
We hold our breath, and JOSSLYN resumes, quietly,
"I sat down, and took up the book I had been reading."
"What was it—1 mean what book r" asks HEXDLKSHAM of
Pikley, the crusty man, thinking that now he has got at the cause of
the hallucination.
"The book?" returns JOSSLYN DYKE, carelessly, "Oh, it was bj
the Cambridge Professor of Political Economy, about the 'Analysis
of the Theory of Equitable Insurance considered as a Factor in the
Future of the British Empire '—a dry subject that interested me at
the time."
RENDLESHAM of Pikley retires, so to speak, into his shell. The
book in question was not calculated to inflame the imagination about
ghosts.
"Well, go on!" I say, for I am anxious, very anxious, to know
what is to be seen in this house Where I have to stay all night. But
not to-morrow, if I know it."
"Well," continues JOSSLYN, slowly, and looking over his shoulder
at the deepening shadows, as though consulting them on the subject,
"Well, there suddenly grew out of that corner an enormous"
Here he breaks off. We are all waiting. Presently he shakes his
head, and says, "No—I won't tell you what I saw. It is better
not. You would only laugh at me, and think me cracky if I told
you."
We all swear we won't laugh and think him cracky. This, how-
ever, is to encourage him to go on with his story.
Nothing will induce him to utter another syllable. He rises,
regretting, he says, that he should have said even as much as he
has. We look at one another. There is some hesitation about
leaving the room. This would be the opportunity for my story, if I
could only call to mind the man's name, and where he was when it
happened, and what it was that did happen. I have a faint glim-
mering of my story. Just so much as to enable me to say to myself,
"His name was something like HOSKINS," when we have to join the
Ladies in the drawing-room. We don't saunter out, we crowd out,
as if for warmth.
In the drawing-room they also have got on to ghost subjects.
It is impossible to help it, in this house. Poor Mrs. TCPTON is
trembling. Miss AYSFORD SYNGE has been telling such dreadful
stories, All about this place, too!" she exclaims.
Mrs. SYNGE has also been narrating a story about some house in
this county, where a coach-and-six always drive up to the front door
whenever one of the family is going to die. Mrs. TUFTON begs them
"not to go on in this manner," and the words are scarcely uttered
when we all hear the sound of a carriage and horses coming up to the
front door. Mrs. TUPTON starts hysterically, and is only prevented
from going ott' altogether by the entrance of a footman to announce
"Mrs. LAWLEIOH BKYNE'S Carriage!"
Mrs. LAWLEIOH BYKNE declares she is really too awfully nervous,
and daren't go out into the hall alone for the world. JOSSLYN accom-
panies her, to assist her with her mantle.
The carriages are announced. At this moment the name of the
hero of the ghost-story I have been trying to remember the whole
evening, suddenly occurs to me. I can't ask JOSSLYN to recall the
company to listen to my story, and, indeed, now I 've got his name,
I am not quite sure of the details. While I am putting these
together, the guests have all left; and JOSSLYN, his Aunt, and
myself are alone at The Mote. Mrs. TUPTON sends for her maid to
sleep in her bed-room, as she is so dreadfully nervous, and JOSSLYN
takes up his candle.
JOSSLYN asks me if I think I can find my way to my room. At
first I say, "Yes, I think so," and add, with an air of gaiety,
"Good night, JOSSLYN. Hope I shan't see any ghosts." But,
on reconsideration, I ask him to show me to my room, as I am not
quite sure of its whereabouts.
"Yes, with pleasure."
I say to him, "I should like to have a good chat together over old
times, and we can smoke a cigar before the fire."
He makes no reply to this suggestion.
My artful idea is to get him to talk and smoke before a good fire
in my room, while I gradually, but surely, undress and get into bed.
Then JOSSI.YN can put out the light and leave me; for, once com-
fortably in bed, with a nice, ruddy, cqsv fire smiling at me, like a
cheery companion, I defy ghosts—specially with my eyes shut.
If JOSSLYN DYKE will only fall, so to speak, into my sociable trap,
then I don't care whether mine is the haunted room par excellence
—they 're all haunted more or less—or not.
"Come!" says JOSSLYN, as solemnly as though he were leading
me to the condemned cell. All the lights are out, except the candle
he is carrying. Suddenly]! start back. "What on earth ?" A
few inches above the floor are two goggle eyes glowering at me.
Recovering myself, I ascertain that these eyes belong to one of the
weird animals, the one that is something between a bull-dog and a
grotesque Chinese ornament, which I had seen on my arrival. The
other dog, the thin white one, pointed at both ends, is just be-
hind him.
"Are the dogs coming up-stairs?" I inquire.
"Yes," answers JOSSLYN. "Snap and Fiend sleep hi my room.
So does Griff, the black cat. You can have one of them with you,
if you like.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Offer declined, with thanks. Hate making a menagerie of a bed-
room. Besides, I have always understood animals see ghosts quicker
than men do (isn't this idea embodied in a proverb about " Pigs
seeing the wind?") and behave in a manner that would drive
me to the verge of insanity. No; let them all come with JOSSLYN
to my room; but let the whole party quit thu apartment together.
We ascend the stairs.
Past the dark corners again—darker than before; along the narrow
slip of old carpet, which seems to have been laid down to accommo-
date a line of acrobats, past the military ghost clock, which keeps
time, as a secret, locked up in its own case, in front of which
JOSSLYN stops, as do also the animals, his three familiars, Fiend,
Snap, and the black cat Griff, who, having trotted on in front with
his tail erect, as though he were saying, "Suicez moi!" now turns,
and sidles up against the wainscot, making his tail describe all
sorts of curious curves, and then performing the figure " 8" in and
out between JOSSLYN'S legs, occasionally rearing himself up on his
hind legs while opening a very red mouth to utter a complaining
sort of whine, intimating his impatience at our unnecessary loitering.
"That clock," JOSSLYX informs me, in a subdued voice, as if afraid
of being overheard, and perhaps contradicted, by some members
of the Phantom Homer family, perpetually in the corners, "that
clock is nearly two hundred years old. It is said to have stopped
at the very hour, on the evening of the murder, when the wicked old
Earl went to his room for the last time. No one has ever dared to
move it; and all attempts at winding it up have been utterly useless."
"The hands have been moved, I suppose?" I observe, as carelessly
as I can, though with that ghostly faded old clock-face staring into
mine, I am somehow conscious of my remark probably being con-
sidered an impertinence. Not by JOSSLYN—oh dear, no! not at all
by JOSSLYN! I don't take him into consideration in the presence of
the Clock.
"The hands," my host answers, "have never been altered. One
of the family, a reckless, hard-drinking, hard-riding Squire, who
inhabited The Mote about fifty years ago, made a bet that he would
move the hands."
"Well?"
"Well—when his companions, whom he had left at table, came to
look for him, they found him sitting where we now stand, a gibber-
ing idiot, the glass of the clock-face open, and the hands pointing
where they had always pointed, and where they have pointed ever
since."
The clock hands, I notice, point to twenty-five minutes past
eight.
"The wicked old Earl," I observe, "used'to retire early."
JOSSLYN regards me regretfully. I beg his pardon. I really did
not intend a pun. No. I explain, I simply meant that the wicked
old Earl did not on that particular night go to bed late. On my
word, there seems to be a punning fiend at my elbow, suggesting,
"Now for another! Say that, though deceased, he couldn't be
spoken of as the late Earl." But I won't yield to the temptation,
which is simply a matter of nerves, as is a joke with the Dentist
who in another second will be holding your jaw for you and pulling
up an ancient tooth by its roots. I beg JOSSLYN to believe me when
1 say that I really did not mean to pun, but am perfectly serious.
Apparently satisfied with my apology, which he seems to accept
on benalf of the clock, JOSSLYN answers,
"Yes, twenty-five minutes past eight was his time for retiring.
And that hour has been ever since invariably associated with some
calamity in the family history."
"Really?"
The dogs both settle themselves down with their forepaws out
before them, like two young Sphinxes, as though expecting a story.
The black cat, whose patience had been long ago exhausted, has,
with less politeness, disappeared.
"At twenty-five minutes past eight," JOSSLYN commences in a
mysteriously confidential tone, "the second Earl of DEPFOKD
was born. He ruined the property; and one morning he was found
hanging on an elm-tree. They cut him down, but he was dead.
His watch had stopped at twenty-five minutes past eight."
"How strange! I murmur; and my voice seems somehow or
another to belong to some one behind me, so that 1 am strongly in-
clined to turn round and see who it is. The words, "How strange!"
seem to have come to me from outside; to have pervaded me, to nave
so got into my head, that I feel as though there were some mechanism
fitted up inside it, arranged to produce only the two articulate words
in a dufl, muffled tone, "How strange!"
"The third Earl," continues JOSSLYN, eyeing the imperturbable
clock-face with respectful sadness, "ran away with an heiress, and
they were privately married in this house, one Christmas eve, at
twenty-five minutes past eight. He wouldn't wait till the half-hour,
as the guardians of the young Lady were actually hammering at the
door. The marriage was an unhappy one. That day year he returned
home suddenly to find his young wife unfaithful. The dinner, which
should have been only laid for one, was set out for two: the Earl
rushed from the room, met Captain GERARD CLEVELAND on these
very stairs, and stabbed him to the heart. On returning to the
dining-room, he found the young Countess sitting before the fire.
Thinking it was the Captain, she said, 'GERAKD, you are too soon;
we do not dine till eight-thirty.' 'And it is now eight twenty-
five!' thundered the husband. What became of them no one
knows."
"Were they never seen again?" I inquire, for the story seems
to finish rather abruptly, and then, to clear my throat — for my voice
sounds husky, I cough gently, very gently — stilling the sound, as
though I were in the sick-room of an invalid, whose life depended
on his not being disturbed by the slightest sound, and at the
same time casting a side-glance at the historical staircase.
JOSSLYN answers slowly, —
"They were never seen a^ain . . . alive. But — —"
He pauses, regarding me inquiringly, as if debating with himself
whether my initiation is sufficiently advanced to permit of my being
admitted to the real secrets. He decides in my favour, and resumes—
NEW LEAVES FOR THE NEW YEAR.
( Width, I fully inean to turn over — if I don't forget it.)

MOKINO — I mean to give
up smoking — or at least
smoking more than (blank)
cigars a day. N.B. — To
make sure of myself, I had
better wait a week or so
ere fixing on the number.
I mean to keep an ac-
curate account of what I
lose at cards, for I feel
certain that I do lose, since
my wife takes all my
winnings.
I mean in my spare mo-
ments — if I ever hare
spare moments — to rub
up my Greek and Latin,
which are getting rather
rusty.
I mean at the same time
— or some time or other —
to polish up my French a
bit, for though it passes
pretty fairly with waiters
who are polyglots, and with
Swiss or German landlords
who can speak a little
English, still, it hardly
stands the test of a table
fhute in Paris,'and still less of a visifwith a French friend to the
Francais!
I likewise mean to look up my Algebra a little, and, if possible, to
dip into my Euclid once a week or so; for nothing helps a man in
life so much as Mathematics; and unluckily at school I always
preferred Cricket.
While I am thus about to complete my education, I mean to set
myself a good stiff course of solid reading, to occupy my mind in
any moments of leisure which may happen to occur to me.
In order to gain time for thus developing my intellect, I mean to
give up reading trashy magazines and novels, and wasting precious
eyesight upon badly-printed newspapers.
I really mean to save up money, if I can, to give myself the treat
of subscribing to a number of most deserving charities.
With this intent, I mean to dine less at the Club, to give up
billiards, and generally to grow more economic in my habits.
I mean to take more exercise and be more careful in my diet, for I
certainly am getting rather stouter than is elegant.
Whenever 1 dine out (which I intend shall be but seldom), I mean
strictly to avoid ever touching sweets or entries, and rigidly to con-
fine myself to two glasses of champagne and, say. three of hock or
claret — reserving power, as Directors do, of adding to their
number " on particular occasions.
I mean to give up oyster lunches — the cost of which is simply
ruinous — and to denv myself the luxury of muffins with my marma-
lade, as I feel sure they prejudicially affect my mental faculties.
I really do intend to
never — no, never — or, at
so late on Sunday mornings.
I mean rigidly to abstain from taking little nips before dinner,
and little naps after it.
And, finally, I certainly intend to invite my wife's Mamma to
come and spend a week with us — probably at Easter, when I think I
can foresee that some unexpected business will summon me to Paris.

To leave you a-shivering here were a sin:
So, as there's no choice, I must e'en take you in!
"Tia a blackish look-out that before you you 've got!
Your parent turned out an extremely bad lot,
And it you inherit ancestral defects,
The Ratepayers' Board may well say it objects
To the burden in store. What a bothersome bout
"We have had with the year that is just slinking out
Like a furtive defaulter ashamed to be seen!
It brought us but little save trouble and teen,
And though one would scarce, while it's moribund, vex it,
One's happy to speed the old nuisance's exit.
How ought we to •welcome the incoming guest ?—
Well, at least 'tis a change, and perhaps it were best,—
Though you come on the neels of the fog and the frost,
Like a poor little foundling in mid-winter lost,
And although your appearance scant evidence bears
That you 're one of those angels who come unawares,—
To give you a welcome; 'tis hard to find ground for it
In aught one can see, look one ne'er so wide round for it.
But JOHN BULL has some tips he would like to impart,
Before for next twelvemonth we make a fair start.
Don't kick up a rota! He is so sick of shines,
That his mind more than ever to quiet inclines.
Your precious progenitor scouted poor Peace,
And scarcely allowed us a moment's surcease
Of shindies abroad, or of squabbles at home,
And the natural Nemesis clearly has come—
In bad morals, bad manners, bad temper, bad trade.
Bad weather, bad health—bad all round, I 'm afraid.'
A spirited policy poked up the nation,
Whose " Spirit," I fancy, needs " rectification,"
E'en more than our frontiers. Oh, if the New Year
Could but banish the spectres Suspicion and Fear,
Conceit, and Cantankerous Vanity, then
We might see Peace on earth, and Good Will among men;
The shout of the Jingo might cease from the land.
And the howl of blind hate, with their haste hand in hand.
Then Bogeys were banished, and Bugbears o'erthrown,
And the trumpets of party and faction unblown;
Then spite might be dumb, and contention might cease,
And the world have a taste of the blessings of peace;
Young Shaver, we hope, as we must take you in,
That you won't add your voice to the general din.
You arrive in bad times and detestable weather,
But, since for a while we must toil on together,
Though laid at our door like a waif by the late
f/nlamented bod bargain, old Seventy-Eight,
If you '11 learn better ways, and not kick up a shine,
We will e'en make the best of young Seventy-Nine.
"The Same Concern."
DEAR MB. PUNCH, Stocum Pogis.
PASSING along Oxford Street, the other day, my eye was
attracted by a shop-window, in which was exhibited a gorgeous
array of Church properties and ecclesiastical brass-work, including
a gigantic three-branched candelabrum. The adjoining shop bore
the legend. "Oxford Nursing Establishment." It occurred to me
that probably the two shop-windows really belonged to one and the
same concern, so that the little Oxford nurslings, after being
brought up at the one, might go for their playthings to the other.
Yours faithfully,
A PHOTESTAST OLD FOGEY.
SEASONABLE BENEVOLENCE.
DAME Nature set a good example to the generous this Christmas.
The frost itself began to give on Boxing-day.

Half-a-dozen Provincial Nobodies will be Somebodies on the line at
the Royal Academy.
The Beauty of the Season will beam from the Photographer's

Dressmaker can invent, and her husband likes to pay for.
Two hundred novels will travel to the butterman's rid the circu-

Several hundred thousand fathers of families will attempt ventila-

The Khedive will ask for a fresh start and a new and large sponge,

Mr. RIVERS WILSON will refuse the request.

Lord PENZANCE will put asunder a certain number of couples
whom Heaven has clearly not joined.
Some unreasonable husbands will complain of their wives' milli-

selves impatiently about their husband's Clubs.
But finally discontent and dissatisfaction will be relieved, and the
end of a dark year brightened, by the publication, at 85, Fleet
Street, of Punch's Almanack and Pocket Book—those inestimable
blessings to anxious parents, and comforts to a care-ridden com-
munity.
THE NEW VALSE STEP (as danced by the swellest young swells of
the season).—The "pas du tout."
OUE REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(At Drury Lane on Boxing Night, and where else would he lie f)
BRAVO, bravo BLANCHARD, Doyen des Pantomimes .' Dean of the
Pantomimes! there's a reverend title! and my humble service to
you, Sir, for all the stories you 've told us these many years past,
and more particularly at this time, for your latest version of
Cinderella; or, Harlequin and the Fairy Slipper. I wish I had
been a Fairy Slipper about ten days ago, when I tumbled down twice,
in the street, on a horrid slide made DV wicked little boys. Had I
then been a Fairy Slipper, I shouldn't have fallen down, and—which
is the real point—hurt myself. But this is a mere parenthesis—
which as "every school-boy" at home for the holidays knows, is
Greek for a slide. The only amusing slides are magic lantern-
slides, for which on the largest and funniest scale, see Polytechnic
Institution.
But to our Pantomime. Once upon a time,"when there were fairies,
there lived a Mr. E. L. BLANCHAHD, who is living now, and who
appears regularly every Christmas to Master CHATTERTON—when he
has been a good boy—and gives him a brand new Christmas Panto-
mime.
Whereupon Master CHATTERTON commences an incantation, as-
sisted by two friends, a bowl of whiskey punch, hot, and a box of the
best Partagas—
"And, as he smokes,
He the YOKES' in-vokes,
The name pro-vokes
Their smiles and jokes;
Then comes f. YOKES,
And he e-vokes
Applause,
Because
Who could complain
Were such trumps played again and again?
For he would be the mokest of mokes
Who 'd blame the Manager when he re-vokes."
Then, by potent spells, he summons to his aid the good genius
BEVERLY to design and paint the scenes, who comes accompanied by
his attendant sprites, Messrs. CTJTHBEKT, Y ARNOLD, WARD, and HALL.
Next wafted into the managerial presence, on various popular airs,
appears Herr KAHL MEYDER, from the land of goblins and Christmas-
trees, to do the music and to compose such an overture as,
working up through "Bloomsbury Square," "Real Jam," "JSt
Cockalorum," "God Bless the Prtnee of Wales," and " Rule Bri-
tannia" to the grand climax of,the National Anthem, causes that
marvellous Boxmg-night-at-Drury-Lane audience to rise as one
man, and with one heart and voice to shout with a genuine impulse
of true loyalty, " God Save the Queen."
Yes, that rise en masse is a sight to see, and the hearty prolonged
cheers a sound to hear! And at this time, in the midst of all our
innocent Christmas frolic and foolery, the eagerness displayed by
this vast holiday crowd to rise and anticipate the first notes of the
National Anthem, has a special and a touching significance, for it
seemed to say, God bless you, Lady, in your sorrow! Your
people's thoughts are with you even in their mirth!" Encored was
the overture, and not a few stood up expecting to hear the anthem
once again, but Herr KABL MEYDEB had decided otherwise.
Then the ferment subsided; Grace had been said, and we settled
down to Pantomime Banquet.
In former years some scenes may have been more gorgeous (cue
for song from Montana, " Scenes that were brighter," adapted to
the occasion), but better painted—never! Front scenes and sets"
are equally excellent.
But Master CHATTERTON and Master Property-Man, why were
there no Big Heads? No, Gentlemen, on my word of honour, I did
not notice a single mask; no, not one pair of stupidly-fixed goggle
eyes, not one idiotic grin preserved alike on all occasions, whether of
joy, of terror, or of woe, on some frank, open, gigantic countenance.
Where are those Philosophers of Pantomime this year? And in the
comic business, among all the " hits" that pass between Clown and
Pantaloon, and the representatives of the Police force, not one poli-
tical hit; that is. up to the third scene of the Harlequinade, when I
gracefully retired.
The three funniest scenes are,—the first, where Messrs. FRED and
FAWDON YOKES are pursued by boars; the Kitchen scene, where
Mr. FRED YOKES, wishing to dress for a ball, is hindered at his
toilette by Mr. FAWHON, and a clever young dog called in the bills,
Azor the Poodle, played by Master CTTLLEK, whose familiarity with
the kitchen pots and pans, and roasting fire, proved him to be quite
at home in the CuUen-ary department; and the Snow scene, where
Misters FEED and FAWDON return from the ball in sedan-chairs. Of
course the YOKES'-family-dance, long and eagerly expected, came at
last, and was as usual, heartily and enthusiastically encored.
Once more the audience roared at that sad melancholy expression
on Mr. FRED VOKES'S face, as he throws his legs alternately over the

heads of either Miss JESSIE or Miss VICTORIA, and seems to say, "It's my fate, I must do it, I
can't help it, I must use my legs like this—it's only once a year—bless you—it can't be helped—it's
of no consequence "—and exeunt omnes.
There is one genuinely artistic bit in Miss VICTORIA'S performance of Cinderella. It is thia.
When the family nave gone to the ball, she, left disconsolate at home, the drudge in the kitchen,
dresses up two chairs, and "makes believe very much," like the immortal Marchioness with the
orange-peel—that they are her partners in a dance; then she sets to them, and dances with them;
but at last, unable to keep up the farce any longer, the thoughts of her lather's and her sisters
cruelty overcome her, and sinking on the chair her pent-up sorrow finds relief in tears.
That great pantomimic artist, G HI MA LIU , could, it is said, draw tears from his audience as easily
as he oould make them split their sides with laughter. Were it only for this one most admirable
touch of nature on the part of Miss VICTORIA VOKES, the Drury Lane Pantomime would be well
worth a visit. So make your arrangements for seeing Cinderella as soon as possible, and write
to your friends, everybody, te " Meet you at the Lane when the Clock strikes Seven-fifteen," as very
soon after half- past the Annual commences, and of course, not for worlds could anyone miss a note
of the Overture, at least, that is the feeling of Youn REPRESENTATIVE.
THE SHOE rx TIME.—As soon as the streets are frozen hard,—but not till then, of course,—
loae no time in taking the proper steps to have your horses provided with screw-pegs—against
the approaching thaw.
CYPRUS—THE IDEAL AND

#reat original, and sings "Cyprus,
white as driven snow." Stranjre
that so astute a man, and so prac-
tised a tactician, should go out of his
way to paint for his Frisco admirers
a picture of Cyprus in couleur de
rose, which lies open to the flat con-
tradiction of facts, and the correction
of every dispassionate and intelligent
observer. Look at the fancy-picture
painted by Lord BEACONSFIELD in
his speech on the presentation of the
San Francisco casket, by the side of
the closely studied sketch from na-
ture of THOMAS BRASSEY, M.P., in
the Times of a few days ago. if yon
want to know how rash and reck-
less in assertion unresisted and un-
oontradicted supremacy in Court
and Cabinet, and contempt of the
public together, can make a long-
headed politician, aud a master of all
the arts of speech and the tricks of
party steering.
Read too, Mr. BRASSEY'S letter, all
you who believe that the lessons of
Crimean blundering and Crimean
disaster have borne fruit in better
arrangements, or more sensible or-
ders from the War-Office authori-
ties, and more efficient execution ol
them by their employfs.
The Duke of CAMBRIDGE complains
that the British public will treat
the official heads of the Army as
fools. After reading Mr. BRASSEY'S
account of _ the sanitary blunders and
commissariat stupidities at Cyprus,
can the Duke wonder at it?
When one thinks of the precious
lives sacrificed, and the good men
left with shattered constitutions, by
the imbecile mismanagement which
disgraced the installation of our
troops in Cyprus—always allowing
for the cold-Wooded sacrifice of the
health, comfort, and convenience of
ten thousand to the momentary
triumph of one great political player
at the game of brag,—Punch feels
apt to fall back into the impatient
wrath of Crimean times, and to ask,
with all respect for our well-meaning
Commander-in-Chief—" whom shall
we get rid of?": if not, totidem
verbis,—"whom shall we hang?"
