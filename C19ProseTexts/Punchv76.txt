THERE was nothing else for it, they said at the F. O. and the C. O.
It had been SIR GARNET's last wish, as he stepped on board the transport at Portsmouth, to have me at his elbow.
I had promised him to think about it. I had thought about it. I had handed over the charge of the Office to TOBY
-transferred the Editorial Chair to the oldest Contributor-kissed Judy and embraced our child— bought a solar topee and a
Kharkee jacket-detached from the trophy, of which it forms the central ray, " le sabre, le sabre, le sabre de mon père," -and,
to cut a long story short, I was there!
" Push on to the front,” said SIR G.; "and see if you can't set things straight with CETEWAYO."
To hear was to oboy. I am not particular about Commissariat or personal comforts. My habit is not to make diffi.
culties, but to overcome them. I waive the tale of my inspannings and outspannings, my struggles over spruits and drifts and
dongas, my weary veld-marches, my breakneck kopje-climbs, my gauntlet-running of Zulu ambuscades, my defiance of all imps
of darkness, and impis of deeper darkness still. Enough that I was there, at last—in the black presence—front to front with
the formidable son of PANDA. I will not say that my interview had not been facilitated by a letter of my friend and CETE.
WAYO's, worthy BISHOP C-L-NSO.
"Let me introduce my old friend PUNCH," he wrote, concisely. "If anybody can make things straight between you
and the English Government, he will. Only listen to what he tells you, and do it.”
I have no very distinct recollection of how I came into the Royal presence. My recollection on this point is, I own,
confused. It could not have been the Caffre beer. I had kept it up late, I know, with the chief poet and head witch-finder,
but they assured me there was not a head-ache in a hundred calabashes ; and I was cool, quite cool-in fact, in something
like a cold chill—when I was told by a black Chamberlain in cow-tail garters, and a court-dress of a bead-belt and head-ring,
that CETEWAYO would be glad to hear anything I had to say to him ; that I was his father; and that he hoped I would adopt
him as my son, and teach him, now that he had washed his spears, how to dry them.
To my astonishment the Zulu monarch was not alone when I reached the presence. He was surrounded with repre-
sentatives of all the Powers England has been at odds with during the last twelvemonth. No wonder the kraal of audience
was crowded. As I stood there—my topee on my head I had notified to the Chamberlain that I would no more stoop to
take off my hat before the Royalty of Ulundi than our Burmese Envoy his shoes before that of Mandalay—the sabre of my
father under my arm, "in act to speak, ... and graceful waved my hand,” I was enabled to identify, on the other side of the
estrade which divided me from my auditors, types of Afghan and Burman, Sclav and Bulgar, Egyptian and Greek, Turk
and Skipetar and Montenegrin-representatives of almost as many races and bloods as there are divisions of opinion in the
Irish Home-Rule party.
“And these are the races we have been fighting—or at least quarrelling with when we were not fighting !" I thought
with pride. "What an illustration of that peace' which we have, at last, learnt to reconcile with honour'" i

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
My self-congratulations were interrupted by CETEWAYO springing nimbly to the front, and clashing his assegai against
his shield by way of enforcing attention.
“Speak, oh PUNCA !” exclaimed the sable monarch. " What should CETEWAYO do ? "
" CETEWAYO Should listen to the Missionaries England has sent him."
“ England is very kind.
kind. But why send all to CEPEWAYO ? Why not keep some at home ?"
“We have not left ourselves altogether without reverend counsellors of the same cloth," I replied, " if not the same
name.”
“But if you have Missionaries left at home, why do they not teach you the same things they teach me? They tell
me I must not invade Englishman's country. Englishman invade mine. They forbid me to wash my spears in Boers'
blood. Englishman wash bis bayonets in Zulus'. They teach me I must not keep up my army of young men. English-
man keep up his army of younger mon than mine. They say I must not kill Zulu. Englishman kill Zulu. I must pot
take your cattle. You take mine. I must not settle on Englishman's or Boer's land. Englishmen and Boers settle on my
young men's."
"Hear! hear!” rang loud from the delighted Representatives of hostile or aggrieved Nationalities, who had huug on
the thick lips of the sable Sovereign.
“ Ditto to CETEWAYO !” they cried, as with one voice. « Do as you would be done by, and you will not do as you
have done."
I found it harder to answer the naked Savage's argument than I had expected; and felt that to go into a detailed
reply would be hopeless. But I at once saw my way to a short cut-like our own High Commissioner.
"You will find my answer there!" I answered, pitching
Volume Seventy-Six
right in the face of the Zulu Monarch. It took him unawares ; broke down the feeble guard of his cowhide shield, and laid
him on his back, prostrate and helpless.
Seizing my opportunity, I leapt on the Volume, and executing a wild war-dance, strove, with emphatic entrechats, to
drive its contents into the prostrate Zulu. In the violence of this exertion, I awoke and lo! it was a dream! And the
sound I had heard was the clamour of the Printer's Boy craving "copy" for the Preface of

TOE's river flows without a break or bridge,
The moments run to days, the days to years :
Strange how we pause on the dividing ridge,
Which 'twixt Old Year and New our fancy rears!
There, with divided mind, see England stand,
Between the chill of fear, the flush of hope,
Scanning the cloud that lies about the land,
For any rift that way to light may ope.
With backward survey o'er the dark “has been,”
With forward gaze into the dark “to be :
Summing the good and ill that we have seen,
As if God's purposes stood plain to see-
As if 'twere man's to reach Heaven's far-off ends;
To reckon up Time's harvest in the seed;
To write off gains of good and ill's amends
The balance of their books as traders read.
As thick a fold between us and the past,
As e'er between us and the future, lies:
The ills we grieve for may work good at last:
Out of our seeming good what ills may rise !
Only one thing we know, that over all
A wise and loving Power holds sovereign sway:
This knowing, let us stand between the years,
Bent but to do the duty of the day;
Speaking the truth and holding to the right,
As we the truth can reach, the right can read :
Trusting the hand that steers, through dark and light,
By His lode-star, not ours, to ends decreed.
Between our larger and our lesser worlds,
Of self, home, city, state or continent,
There is no variance of far or near,
Of great or small, in that Guide's measurement,
Twixt strokes of policy that hit or miss,
And sleights of skill that make or mar a cause.
Then, grateful, take his gifts, his strokes, submiss,
And look to Man for rule, to Heaven for Laws.

And pale Alkestis from his clutches rent,

While work grows scanter, and distress grows more ;

To thrust the Wolf of Want from England's door!

“The RECORDER, in passing sentence, said
that at the age of 10 the prisoner was sen-
tenced to 10 days' imprisonment and 10 years in
a reformatory. When that sentence expired,
prisoner was convicted of assault, and in 1870 he
was sentenced at Manchester to 10 years' penal
servitude for sacrilege, after which came the
crime he was now to be punished for."
With that his Honour sentenced the cul-
prit to another ten years' penal servitude,
to be followed by five years' police super-
vision. It does not seem to have occurred
to him, as a happy thought, that he might
as well have given him five years' more

series of tens which have distinguished
his remarkable career. A character who
has kept the even tenor of his evil way, in

be expected to amend his life ; and the

Factious opponents might easily draw an
offensive parallel between what a certain
illustrious pair brought back from Berlin,

copper rims thinly, washed with silver,
which MOSES brought back from the fair.

FLOUR V. GYPSUM.
That most far-sighted of Lord Mayors, the illustrious
WHETHAM, seems to be as determined on damping sani-
tary zeal as over-eager charity. Only in this way can we
explain the snubbing he thought fit to administer to Dr.
SAUNDERS, Officer of Health and Public Analyst for the
City, who had been ill-advised enough to bring before
him the case of a cargo of stuff imported as wheat-meal,
but so largely adulterated with Plaster of Paris, that
Dr. SAUNDERS was able to exhibit a donkey's head
moulded from this devil's dust, in practical illustration
of the quality of the samples from twenty sacks, armed
with which he sought the aid of the LORD MAYOR to
have the perilous stuff condemned and seized before it
found its way into the trade, the bakers' ovens, and the
stomachs of Her Majesty's lieges.
The LORD MAYOR, instead of condemning the villanous
mixture, condemned the doctor, telling him he should
have prosecuted the man who sold the flour. The usual
course of common-place Magistrates acting under the
power of the Nuisance Removal Act, applicable in such
matters, is to direct seizure of the offending article, and
so keep it out of the market. The LORD MAYOR prefers
to wait till it gets there.
In the mean time, Dr. SAUNDERS has learnt that a
foreign baker in Dean Street, Soho, has made 114
"wheaten loaves” from this gypsumised meal, two of
which were laid on the table besides the ass's head—the
bane beside the symbol of what should have been the
antidote.
Probably the foreign baker may think himself war-
ranted in bringing these loaves into the market as
“French bread," on the strength of the Plaster of Paris
they contain. We should like to see the illustrious
WHETHAM condemned to a week of this costive semi-
cereal mixture, by which time he would, perhaps, be
brought to understand that it is better to keep such a
poisonous compound out of the market, than to take your
chance of tracing it into so-called bread-stuffs, after it
gets there.

OUR AMERICAN SHIPWRIGHTS.
The Government has, according to the Times, ma-
terially augmented the strength of the Navy by the
addition of
“THE HERRISHOFF TORPEDO. --A small torpedo-boat, which
has just been constructed by order of the English Board of
Admiralty at the well-known Herrishoff Manufactory Works,
Bristol, Rhode Island, U.S.”.
This vessel is described as, though little, a multum in
parvo, and a marvel of ingenuity and destructive power.
Her acquisition reflects very great credit on Mr. W. H.
SMITH and his colleagues ; the rather that, like men of
business, they have purchased her in the cheapest mar-
ket. But fancy that market being an establishment at
Bristol, Rhode Island, U.S.! When the Government
goes to America for a torpedo-vessel, what is likely to
become of the British Ship-builder, unless he looks
mighty sharp after himself.
A Question to be Very Much Asked.
THERE has been another of those terrible pit-explosions,
attended with wholesale loss of life, but too frequent in
the mining districts, at Dinas Colliery, in Glamorgan-
shire. It is stated that Mr. CHUBB, whose certificate as
manager of the pit in which the explosion has taken
place was a short time ago suspended for six months by
the Inspector of Mines, after careful judicial inquiry, in
consequence of gas having been allowed to accumulate
in the workings, has still been virtually left in authority,
though the management has nominally been changed.
This allegation will, of course, be closely inquired into.
If it be true, it may be said to be a case not only of a
CHUBB's lock, but of a CHUBB's dead-lock, on life-pro-
tecting mining legislation !
A Hasty Conclusion.

GREAT FIRES MADE EASY.
If you have fire-buckets, always bang them too high to be got at,
or they may be tampered with by mischievous people.
If your water-pipes are frozen, wait till they thaw, rather than
put yourself to the cost and trouble of keeping water ready within
reach, which will be useless as soon as the frost (always brief in this
country) is over.
If you have an Extincteur on the premises, see that it is kept well
out of the way, as the sight of it may put the thought of "fire"
into nervous people's heads.
Be careful to keep secret the position of your hydrants and fire-
plugs, if you would not have them made playthings of by “our
In the event of your keeping a private engine, do not keep crying
“Wolf !” by perpetually practising your people in the use of it.
Be very careful where you keep your engine-house key. If lost,
you will have to buy another.
Generally trust to the spur of the moment, and the stimulus of
suddenness, for dealing with fire or other danger which human
life and property are liable. Nothing so developes presence of mind
and readiness of resource as a sudden demand upon them, and these
are invaluable qualities which it is well worth running the risk
of an occasional fire to encourage.
ENGLISH Art has lost a prominent and distinguished professor
in EDWARD MATTHEW WARD, though the loss of him will leave
a less sensible gap in our Academic array than it would have
left some years ago, before failing health had impaired his keen
conception and weakened his vigorous hand. But looking back
from the dark foreground of his premature death over the long
and large labour of his energetic life, what various and vivid
groups, both English and foreign, rise in the mind's eye! With
what distinctive form has his powerful pencil filled up the pen-out-
lines of CLARENDON, and GRAMMONT, PEPys and EVELYN, DEFOE,
BOSWELL, and GOLDSMITH. And besides his scenes from the
history of our own English and Scottish revolutions, how
pathetically he has embodied some of the saddest memories of
that of France—the troubled sleep of Louis, and the watchful
labour of his once proud but now piteous Queen, in the Temple
prison—the agony of the Royal Mother's loneliness—the sad
fabours and sadder amusements of her innocent, imprisoned
children!
How much emptier would be our Gallery of the Past had
this vivid painter not laboured to people it for us. Measuring
our debt to him by his best work, it will be acknowledged to be
great by all who believe-as most English-speaking people be-
lieve that Art has now no better function than to re-create
the life of the Past, and to preserve the life of the Present.

Intoning v. Mis-Reading,
In the controversy lately raised concerning Church Musio, one
very strong argument for intoning, was unaccountably omitted.
If à Clergyman of a gushing disposition had to intone the Marriage
Service, he would not read it in what reporters of a "Marriage in
High Life commonly describe as an impressive manner"-a
manner of exaggerated pathos and affected solemnity. It is perhaps
a pity that sermons are not more generally intoned.

DIRECTORS' BALM OF GILEAD.

CIRCULAR No. 2,037.
THE Directors of the Great G. N. E. and G. W. Railway Company having
given full and careful consideration, to the numerous complaints which have
reached them, through both public and private channels, of shortcomings in
the management of the Lines under their control, as well as the able repre-
sentations to the same effect of many eminently respectable deputations, feel it
their duty to acknowledge that these complaints and representations have very
considerable foundation in fact.
They are reluctantly compelled to admit, what it would be idle to deny, that
irregularity in the arrival of trains is the rule, and that this irregularity is
invariably on the wrong side.
That preventible accidents are frequent, owing largely to overhours and
short-handedness on their lines; to deficiency in brake-power and machinery,
and objectionable construction of carriage-steps and platforms;
That station and carriage accommodation are in many respects insufficient;
and, lastly,
That fares once raised, are never, to the best of the Directors' knowledge,
brought down again.
The Directors feel further bound to admit, that season-ticket holders, in
particular, have good reason for dissatisfaction with the rise in the price of their
tickets ;
While, as regards other grounds of complaint, too numerous to particularise,
they have no hesitation in allowing that passengers have not been treated
with
the consideration they might not unreasonably think they had a right to expect
for their money,
They trust that these candid admissions will show how ready the Directors
are at all times to consider and investigate all reasonable complaints and well-
substantiated charges.
Under these circumstances they feel that there is but one course now open
to the Directors.
They hasten to take it.

SHOPKEEPERS V. STORES.
A DEPUTATION of London Tradesmen waited yesterday
on Mr. Punch to solicit his intervention to rescue them
from the ruin they believe themselves threatened with
by the competition of Co-operative Stores.
The Deputation was headed by Mr. TILLKINS, who
expressed their fears in prolix and piteous terms.
Mr. Punch said he had himself no dealings with Co-
operative Stores. He continued to patronise the trades-
men he had employed all his life. They supplied him
with the best of articles on the lowest possible terms;
and were content with the honour of serving him, as he
never asked credit. As long as they fulfilled these con-
ditions, they would preserve his custom. In what way
could he assist the respected gentlemen he saw before him?
Mr. COMPTER said that the Government allowed Co-
operative establishments to be carried on under the
names of Departments, and entitled Civil Service, Naval,
and Military Stores. A word from Mr. Punch, he was
mo
sure, would compel the authorities to prohibit this un-
warrantable assumption.

PETER DERMOD, who, I have always heard, is full of
anecdote, and the very best of company. Clearly a treat
is in store.
I go down to the Hutch, Halfshire, and find a con-
siderable party assembled. PETER is anxiously expected.
The Hutch, Halfshire, is a pretty house, in a charm-
ing, well-wooded situation, and, like Rome, was evi-
dently not built in a day-by which I mean that the
Hutch has been, probably, put together, at different
times, by different people with different opinions. The
oldest portion is of the early and very plain English
farm-house type, with pointed roof, and plenty of waste
space for box-rooms and lofts. Then came someone who
thought it would be cheaper to add than rebuild, and
who had a taste for verandahs. This second owner de-
cided that the first was wrong in putting his front door
facing north, and so he commenced alterations by turning
the hall into the drawing-room, converting the door into
a window, and making the entrance on the east side,
under a verandah. This gentleman's successor evidently
considered both his predecessors utterly mistaken, and
at once decided that the drawing-room must be where
the kitchen was, that the hall should take the place of
the drawing-room, that the front door, with a carriage
drive, should be on the West, that the verandahs should
remain, and a garden door should occupy the place of
the dining-room window.
Then came Pilton, who took The Hutch because, he
said, “He saw what could be done with it"-which,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A FIGURE FOR FARNHAM.
PUNCH,
ONE of your evening papers, called the Echo,
contains the following notice of an honour which some
people are said to intend doing to the memory of one of
the best, wisest, and greatest men that Farnham, or
Surrey, or indeed any place in all England, or the whole
world, for the matter of that, ever produced :-
“It is proposed to erect a statue of WILLIAM COBBETT at
Farnham, his native town.”
Observe, the writer of the above paragraph says "a
statue of WILLIAM COBBETT.” Not of the late WIL-
LIAM COBBETT," as some of your leatherheaded penny-
a-liners would have stupidly said. No; because he
perceived, what a set of boobies could never have dis-
covered, the ridiculous absurdity of calling, la man
“the late” when that man is acknowledged by all
instructed and sensible people to be immortal.
To be sure, the numerous and useful works of that
incomparable Author, whose birth has given Farnham
celebrity throughout the civilised world, are monument
enough for him. But if, besides, the admirers of excel-
lence choose to assign him also a molten or graven image,
by all means let them.
Perhaps, in order to further the execution of a work of
Art which will reflect the highest credit on all concerned
in it, you will, if you can, inform its promoters where an
authentic cast of Farnham's illustrious native above-
named is to be found. The only thing of the kind I my-
self can think of is the well-known waxen effigy at
Madame Tussaud's, clothed in the dress he habitually
wore, and deliberately rolling its head from side to side
by means of ingenious mechanism. A copy of it in bronze
or marble, surmounted with an awning to keep the rain
out of the works, would serve for a lifelike statue of your
disembodied but constant reader,
Botley, Hampshire, Hades.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE (DEAD) LETTER OF THE LAW.
GEORGE SMITH, of Coalville, a kindly man, whose heart
had been moved for the neglected, ill-cared-for, and too
often ill-used wives and children of our bargees—that
large but little known floating population of our canals
and rivers,--mainly by his own exertions in urging the
subject on the Home Office and the Collective Wisdom,
at last got an Act passed for the registration and in-
spection of barges. The origin and effect of the regis-
tration was to bring the barge-babies within the pale of
school-law; and one chief object of the inspection was
to see and secure that certain elementary conditions as
to living and sleeping-space, ventilation and cleanli-
ness, were complied with. In a word, the law aimed
at making the barge-children fit to live, and the barges
fit to live in.
Thereupon, Punch very much applauded Mr. GEORGE
SMITH for what he had done, and sat down, hugging
himself in the thought that the worst days of the barge-
women and barge-babies were over, and that old father
Antic, the Law, had taken these poor outcasts and out-
lyers under his protection.
But now he learns to his equal amazement and dis-
may that the Barge Registration and Regulation Act
is, in many—if not in most cases-a dead letter ; that in
one instance a barge-owner has written in vain, more
than once, to the Local Authorities of his native town,
asking them to have his barges inspected and registered.
He has not even got an answer to his letters. In fact,
it almost seems," writes Mr. SMITH to the Daily News,
"as if those who have the carrying out of this Act-
one of the most beneficent Acts of the present Govern-
ment-are determined to let it quietly die, and then
bury it and nobody know."
Another Correspondent of the Daily News, Mr. Lang-
DON, writes :
"To-day I have walked along the sides of the canal from
Hampstead Road wharf to the City Road basin, and visited the
wharves in the neighbourhood of Edgware Road and Paddington,
and have seen between 130 to 150 canal boats, barges, and flats,
and I have not seen one canal boat, barge, &c., which has been
registered in accordance with the provisions of the Act.”
In the name of those on whose behalf the Act was
passed, the women and children, whose lives are lived,
and often lost, aboard these floating homes, Mr. Punch

just now :-
“ The able-bodied idlers who bawl out their
wants in West-End squares, and then relieve
them in the nearest publichouses, are beneath
contempt, and should be taken care of by the

MR. PUNCH,

We, the shopkeepers of England, pay him, Sir, and we have a right
to insist upon his giving us money's worth for our money, His
salary, and the salaries of all his fellow Civil Servants should be cut
down. It is high time we should touch British statesmen in their
most sensitive point-their pockets. Cabinet Ministers and Civil

BRITANNIA owes the sovereignty of the waves, the roast beef of Old
England, and the flag that braved for a thousand years the battle

be disappointed! Again I am forced to pause-I can scarcely write
for indignation !
Surely it will not be pretended that there was no subject calling
for public remark. Hardly, when the shopkeepers of London—that
body of men who form the very marrow and sinews of the nation-
are crying trumpet-tongued for justice. And when-unless justice
is done them-the sun of the British Empire is in all probability
about to set for ever.

beside the question. You are punished that
others may take warning from your fate,
and thus avoid your evil courses. How-
ever, as the Jury have rather strangely
recommended you to mercy, I will not be
harsh. I award you eighteen years—to be

PRISONERS AT THE BAR,
For thus, painful as it may be to
my feelings, I must call you. A Jury of
your countrymen, after a long trial, have,
with whatever reluctance, found you guilty
-a word I use with the greatest possible
regret. It is not for me to comment upon
the harshness of the language used in the
indictment. I sit here as Judge, not as
public prosecutor, and I am deeply thank-
ful that the cruel duty of the prosecution
has not devolved on me. It is to me a
source of deep satisfaction that you have
not been proved to have received in your
own name, and on your private accounts,
any identifiable portion of the large sums
obtained by the publication of false balance
sheets, and other documents of a misleading
character, which you have been found guilty
of fabricating and issuing. Had you been
distinctly traced in putting into your own
pockets, all, or most of the money obtained
by means of these highly coloured publi-
cations, I should have considered your con-
duct (I trust you will pardon me for saying
so) decidedly open to severer animadversion
than I feel it necessary to apply to it under
the actual circumstances of the case. May
I be permitted to hint, that it would have
been better if you had not paid so many
millions into the accounts of firms so closely
connected with your own body. I cannot
help thinking, that the advocate who has
conducted the prosecution, has (no doubt
unconsciously) exceeded his duty. He has
painted-with a strength of colouring which
it might, perhaps, under the circumstances,
have shown better taste to have toned down
-the ruin flowing from what he calls your
misdeeds. You have thus been put to a
great deal of, what I must call, superfluous
suffering. I do not, for my part, quite see
what the wholesale ruin of widows and
orphans has to do with the matters at issue
in this case. However, I must take the
law as I find it; and the law, I am afraid,
with its habitual sternness, proclaims you
guilty. The verdict of the Jury to that
effect has been received with a great deal
of unseemly applause, which it was my
duty, however reluctantly, to repress. It
is my painful task to remind you that you

When the fumes of my solder has got in their eyes,
When I've sp’iled a few gimcracks with lampblack and size,
Dropped taller in lumps on the floors here and there,
And broken the back or the seat of a chair,
Broke three or four bells, or maybe 'arf-a-dozen,
When everyone's grubby and cross and 'arf frozen,

And so, smart and lively, I keeps up the game.

But a jolly 'ard winter's the time for the Plumber!

THE PALACE OF ART.
I BUILT myself a high-art pleasure-house!
For my sick soul at peace therein to dweli.
I said, "I have the true æsthetic nous,
And can design it well."
'Twas dull red brick, with gables set galore,
And little light did through the windows pass,
For 'twas shut out by thick lead frames that bore
Quarrels of grey-green glass.
The dadoed walls, in green were stained, no tint
Which common blue and yellow mingled make;
But green y-wrought-of sepia without stint-
With indigo and lake.
Nor grained panel nor enamelled slate
Was there to jar on my artistic sight;
Plain ebon woodwork framed the open grate,
And over,-blue and white.
Two lovely griffins, made of burnished brass,
I found, to guard the fireplace on each side,
With curling tails (though one was lost, alas !),
And mouths that gaped wide.
All round the rooms were shelves of black-dyed deal,
On which stood pots and plates of every hue;
Whilst far apart two lilièd angels kneel
In Robbia white and blue.
One deep recess, serge-covered, like a lawn,
Held, on a brass-nailed shelf, its seat of state,
Apart from other pots and pans withdrawn,
An ancient kitchen-plate.
“ Hence whilst the world runs round and round,” I said,
“I will send forth my wits to gather wool;
With task or toil I will not vex my head;
But on that plate feed full.”
So day and night upon that plate I gazed,
And strove to fix thereon what thought I had;

CLAY V. COTTON.
We recommend to the considera-
tion of our friend The Textile Manu-
facturer, who was so severe on Punch
for his assault on the adulterators
of cotton cloths with China clay, the
report of the case of Provand v.
Laughton lately decided.
The action was for damages sus-
tained by the discoloration of certain
packages of grey shirting exported
from Manchester to Shanghai.
The Plaintiffs said the discoloration
was due to sizing. The Defendants
said it was caused by stains from the
tarpaulin wrapper of the packages.
The case lasted eight days, and the
Plaintiffs got a verdict. The Manu-
facturer of the cloth himself gave
evidence that the sizing consisted of
farina, China clay, chloride of mag-
nesium, chloride of zinc, and blue.
His son, the manager of the sizing
department, admitted that each piece
of 37} yards ought to weigh 8{ lb.,

of size; it might be some ounces
more; it might be 3 lb. 12 oz. or

besides many who reside with friends or relatives
in Cambridge. The number of applications from

hali close to Newnham Hall of about the same
size. Very probably lecture-rooms suited for the

are equally eager to learn the latest news about his
movements. The Governor of the gaol in which he is in-
carcerated spends the whole of his time in answering in-
quiries, and the business of the prison has come to a
standstill. The warders are visited daily by scores of
members of the Press, and all "fixtures for floggings,
&c., have had to be postponed. There is no one to attend
to the machinery of the treadmill, so for the present the
prisoners have had to forego their customary exercise.
Oakum-picking, too, is all but suspended.
Yesterday HOPE breakfasted at half-past nine. He
complained of the weakness of the tea, and asked for
another egg. After an extra spoonful had been put in
the pot he became quite cheerful, and joked with the
attendant warders. He made several very amusing puns
upon his own name and that of the new President of
the French Republic.
At eleven o'clock HOPE received a visit from the
Governor, with the information that the Authorities had
refused the application of his third Cousin once re-
moved for admission to an interview with him. The
applicant is considered by the Authorities to have been
led to ask for the interview rather by a morbid curiosity
than any other and higher motive.
At twelve Hope was visited by the Doctor, who, we
are glad to say, is much pleased with his patient's im-
provement in weight, stamina, and spirits, under the
soothing influences of regular hours and a carefully-
arranged dietary. HOPE remained in conversation with
his Medical Adviser for more than an hour, and seemed
to be deeply interested in the progress of the Russian
Plague. He expressed much satisfaction on learning
that there was little chance of the terrible disease reach-
ing England. It appears that the spread of the Plague,
and the probability of its visiting our shores, had caused
him considerable alarm.
In the course of the afternoon the Prisoner continued
his autobiography, one of the Warders acting as his
Amanuensis. He also sent the following letter to his
wife :---

MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN,

MY LORD DUKE AND GENTLEMEN,
'Tis with surprise
At the curious course of events that I rise;
I'm a plain man of business, and not fond of speaking,
And e'en this occasion is not of my seeking;
But the cry of electors has called me, and, therefore,
I'll tip, you four columns-as much as you 'll care for.
The voice of the Country-I bar some bar-sinisters,
Who always run crossbacks Her Majesty's Ministers.
Quite right; we have crowned it with honours and glories.
The Rads do deny it,-but then they tell stories.
Sad disaster in Africa ? Yes, but, believe it,
Our soldiers, brave fellows! will promptly retrieve it.
We mean to go on, spite of Liberal jeering,
And settle that question for ever. (Much cheering.)
Strong statements have issued from Chatsworth and Newnham,
They're mainly smart fudge, and I boldly impugn 'em :
Naughty boys, out of funds, sigh for goodies and toffies,
And Rads, out of power, of course pine for office.
C'est le mot de l'énigme in all squabbles political,
When you 're out in the cold you are sure to turn critical.
The condition of Europe, thanks wholly to us,
And in spite of the Liberal fury and fuss,
Is just what it should be at least, very nearly,
Of Cyprus some quidnuncs have cackled severely;
I've been there myself, and I found it delightful.
The fallacies spouted by HARCOURT were frightful!
It does not harbour fever,—to any extent;
And it will harbour ships,—when some tin has been spent.
Just listen to GARNET! A rather long letter,
But take it for gospel-you could not do better.
It settles the grumblers. Our enemies think
When they call it a pest-house, a desert, a sink,
That of well-deserved kudos they've cleverly stript us.
Pooh, pooh! With some cash, and the-hum!—Eucalyptus,
You'll find it, in spite of the fools who find fault, a
Superb combination of Eden and Malta.
And then, as regards our financial affairs,
Mid-Lothian's proximate Candidate dares
To say they are in a deplorable state ;
But you'll find they will turn out all right, if you 'll wait.
If taxation is swelled to a tidy amount,
We're prepared for each item to render account.
And what more would you have ? Bills will run up, you know,
E'en the Birmingham Radicals find how they grow.
In fact, "we all do it," so why make a bother?
So much for one Bogey. Bad Trade is another.
To charge us with bringing on that is a shame,
Over-trading and GLADSTONE are chiefly to blame.
'Twould ne'er have appeared, but for his rash temerity
In raising, and praising, disastrous prosperity.
Still, we are not all starving. We dig lots of coal,
And the working-men's savings expand on the whole ;
Our taxes are light (so there 's room for increase),
.
If the workman won't listen to Radical stories,
But stick to his bench, and his best friends, the Tories,
Trade will very soon show a surprising revival,
And Old England will stand as of old without rival,
Strong, proud, inoffensive, imperial, united!
There! 'I think that's the lot; and I trust you're delighted-
This I fancy's a settler for HARCOURT and HARTY ;
Five Columns ! Not bad for a taciturn party.
Speech is silvern, and silence is golden, I hold,
But a Smith works in silver as well as in gold;
And I can play the Silver-Smith. Thanks for the hearing
You've given. And now I'll sit down. (Prolonged cheering.)

MISPLACED CHARITY.
ON COMING OUT of Church, General Sir TALBOT DE La Poer SANGRAZUL is so struck BY THE BEAUTY OF THE AFTERNOON SKY,
THAT HE FORGETS TO PUT ON His HAT, AND LADY JONES (WHO IS RATHER NEAR-SIGHTED) DROPS A PENNY INTO IT!
A LESSON
“Fas est ab hoste doceri.”
John Bull soliloquises.
I can't stand being lessoned. 'Tis not nice
At any time from foes to take advice;
And when the heart is hot with rage and grief,
That in swift vengeance fain would seek relief,
The preachers of cool caution, and good heed,
With their trite text of "more haste, and worse speed,”
Appear, to those who crave revenge's balm,
Mere lukewarm counsellors of craven calm.
Yet, oft 'tis true that patience asks more pluck
Than fierce and fiery haste to run a-muck.
To fervid patriot zeal and pride of race
Facts are at times e'en harder foes to face
Than those bloodthirsty hordes, fierce, vengeful, swift,
To my heroic handful at Rorke's Drift,
Or red Insandula! Thoughts of that rain
Of murderous assegais will fire my brain !
Avenged ? Ay, ay! There is no need to pule,
Still less, to spur me like a stubborn mule,
Or hound my eager war-dogs on the trail
Of the swart slaughterers. They will not fail,
When with the foe they close in eager fight,
To balance the account and set things right.
“Right?” 'Tis a widish word, not always clear
To the distempered gaze of hate and fear.
E'en noble indignation, in its heat,
Fails sometimes of a purview quite complete.
Panders,
who dub me the world's paragon
Whose will makes right, would blindly spur me on
To vengeance indiscriminate, and claim
Monopoly of patriotic fame.
I fancy all that sort of thing looks small
To the Eternal Eye that measures all,
And has one standard, accurate and fair,
For me and the stark savage in his lair,
I hear the still cool voice of patriot sense ;
Yes, though, midst fumes of flattery coarse and dense,
Loud self-laudation, swaggering round the land,
Would howl it down, I hear and understand.
First I must honour, and avenge, the slain;
My brave five hundred must not die in vain.
Not for the first time Blunder has given scope
To British valour ;-would that I dared hope
'Tis for the last! That sadly glorious scene
Should teach rash headiness and stiff routine
Some needed lessons. On revenge's track
Those who watch o'er my war-dogs are not slack.
I hope they're sure and safe as they've been swift.
Yet wise prevention is far better thrift
Than cure, howe'er complete; nor is it wise
Rashly to make, or recklessly despise,
E 'en savage foemen. They are fools who spurn
Sound lessons, though a foe’s. I'm game to learn!

swe-e-et!”
All his intimates call him MOSTHYN. This sounds all right, but
it puts a stranger, so to speak, on entering, on to the wrong scent;
for who would suppose that those who call a man " DICKIE," and
“Mr. DICKIE,” are his merest acquaintances, while those who call
him MOSTHyń are his most intimate friends? How did it begin ?
Trace the genealogical tree to its ancestral root, and there will pro-
bably be found a RICHARD at the bottom of it. He came over with
the Conqueror, or without him, as RICHARD, simply RICHARD. His
friends called him " DICK." His playful friends called him
“DICKON.” An eccentric old Norman baron called him " DICKIE.”
This old Norman þaron was rich. He quarrelled with his family,
left his money and estates to his boon companion, whom he had only
known as "DICKIE." This fixed the heir's name. Henceforward
he and his heirs were DICKIES. They went on and prospered, in
spite of, as the vulgar phrase has it, or used to have it (and can
have it again as far as I am concerned), in spite of "its being all
dicky with them.”
The above is a hypothetical history of the MOSTHYN DICKIE
family. Some DICKIE in the Sixteenth Century married into the
MOSTHYN family-whose name, probably, owed its origin from some
witty King seeing one of his courtiers very lank and meagre, and,
like JULIUS CÆSAR, considering lean men as dangerous to the State,
he at once designated him as Most Thin, and gave him some fine
fat lands to subsist on. "Most-thin" then became MoStayn-and
thenceforward a rich, happy family, and stout supporters of Royalty

CLAUD, this extension of the suffrage would usher in a new
departure for England on the way of good government.
It is a comfort to have the two sides of the shield
painted for one in this fine bold fashion.
Sir W. BARTTELOT put forward the bluff county JOHN
BULL view very roundly. A man might be anything
but a blaekguard, yet be as unfit to have the franchise
as the biggest blackguard. (Quite true, Sir WALTER.)
No man should have a vote who did not pay direct
taxes. (Very much inclined to agree with you, Sir
WALTER.) What right had men to a vote who would
not pay even for the education of their children? (If
they can, Sir WALTER, but it's not so easy out of 108. a
week,) Making faggot votes !-pooh!-that was an old
business, and had always been carried on, by Whigs and
Tories. (Not a doubt of it, Sir WALTER.)
Mr. PARNELL retorted by a fiery protest against Lord
CLAUD's calumniation of the Irish people as bigots.
Didn't he stand there in disproof-an Irish Protestant
sitting for an Irish Roman-Catholic constituency?
(Mr. PARNELL forgets that this may be “not because
they love Catholies less, but because they love Obstruc-
tives more.”)
Mr. Lowe turned out the less brilliant side of the
shield, and with a vehemence of protest, delivered in a
tone of intense conviction, which kept his own side silent,
but roused a storm of cheers from the opposite Benches,
set forth the lamentable deterioration of constituencies

principle they had saddled their Amendment with "at the

time could be the right time for that. (But suppose the

Sunday evening, on “The Future of the Irish Race.” In your idea
it seems the Irish race is less a matter of country than of creed.

LIGHTS THAT REALLY ENLIGHTEN.
AMONG the most needed and newest lights of the time
are the lamps in the Cromwell Road and Queen's Gar-
dens district. They not only throw a light on the streets,
but on their names, which are, at last, legibly painted
on one side of the lamps at recurring intervals.
When one remembers the chaos this region used to be,
after dark, to hapless diners-out and their drivers, the
comfort of steering by the present luminous chain of
directions on the lamps is not to be described.
As Punch has been preaching up this simple provision
for the public convenience for months past, he can only
express the hope that now that one local authority has led
the way in this small and uncostly but very real improve-
ment-whether persuaded by Punch's preaching, or not,
matters little-other local authorities will go and do like-
wise.
Only one more improvement is wanted even in the
enlightened Cromwell Road region—that the numbers of
the houses should be painted, at intervals of ten, on the
same lamps which now bear the names of the streets.
ARMS FOR THE ENEMY.
Some indignation has perhaps been somewhat unduly
created by statements which appeared in a daily paper,
stating that a firm in Whitechapel, and another at Man-
chester, are manufacturing arms for shipment to the
Zulus. But the aid thus afforded to a savage enemy may
be not by any means so bad as it seems. Dealers can
have no interest in sending CETEWAYO and his soldiers
any better firearms than the worst manufactured for ex-
portation at Birmingham. The worse, the cheaper, there-
fore the more profitable for the vendors. Parties engaged
in selling the Zulus rifles so bad as to be sure to burst
in their hands, also sell the Zulus, and are driving a
trade which is the reverse of unpatriotic, however
un-
scrupulous. Punch therefore hesitates to say that the
fellows ought to be hanged.

(Monday, March 10—Lords.)
USSIA seems to have lent us a chapter out of
her book. Our High Commissioners and
Commanders appear to have a general
authority to “Go in and win-or lose,”
as the case may be. Sir BARTLE FRERE
has been declaring war on his own hook
in South Africa, and now we learn
from Lord CRANBROOK's answer to Lord
RIPON's interpellation that General
ROBERTS has been annexing, on his own hook,
in the Kurram Valley. And "what for no?"
The Ministers of an Imperial policy have their
rights, as well as their duties--and the first is
to go a-head." Lord BEACONSFIELD'S "stand-
ing order ” might be condensed into HORACE's
line-
“Rem bene si poteris, si non, quocunque modo, rem."
“Push our Empire, wisely and honestly, if you can ; but push it, anyhow." As Lord Nelson told his Captains, "No man can be far
wrong who lays his ship alongside an enemy,” Lord B. would seem to lay down the direction, “No man can be far wrong who
quarrels with somebody, and annexes something !”
Lord LAWRENCE is puzzled to understand when and where, if we go on annexing Cabulwards, we are to come to Lord B.'s “Scientific
Frontier,” maintainable with a large reduction of existing forces. Nor did Lord NAPIER of Magdala—who has descended from his
Rock to give Government the benefit of his Indian lights-condescend to tell him.
Lord NAPIER explained that henceforth we meant to defend India beyond the passes. How we were to defend its defenders he did not
explain. Perhaps the next year will show.
(Commons.) --A night with the Naval Authorities.
Mr. GOSCHEN wanted to know what Mr. SMITH could not tell him, Why, in our South-African need, we have not drawn on that
promptly available force, the Marines? What can the Horse-Guards, who have the bottling-off and decanting of the choicest military
port, be expected to care about empty bottles ? Mr. Smith promises the Jollies shall be the next to go to the front. That is something.
The First Lord had a pleasant piece of news, to take out the taste of his rather perfunctory answer to Mr. GoSCHEN. Hearing of Isandula
at St. Helena, Captain BRADSHAw of the Shah at once shipped the little island's little garrison, and sailed for the Cape with them and
the Shah's own Naval Brigade of four hundred Bluejackets. Punch will not say Pshaw,-but, Bravo BRADSHAW! to this plucky
piece of promptitude. That is helping, on your own hook-better than declaring war or annexing on it.
Mr. SAMUDA pleads for improvement in the position of Naval Ship-Carpenters. How about the Engineers, Mr. SAMUDA ? Surely, with
steam and iron coming everywhere to the front, our “Chips" can hardly hold his own with those who superintend our Stokers and
Pokers. Suppose we improved their pay and position a little ?
Mr. Vans AGNEw complained of stagnation in naval promotion, which he perversely, ascribed to the new and hard Retirement Rules.
These rules, no doubt, do superannuate many good and serviceable officers, and are only defensible (as Mr. Smith and Mr. CHILDEBS both
explained) on the plea that they stir, instead of stagnate, promotion. To find out how in piping times of peace to keep the tide of promo-
tion running merrily in a service whose strength must be kept equal to the strain of war, would take many Vans-loads of ingenuity.
Lord C. BERESFORD wants more Naval Barracks, to keep paid-off men together. So does Mr. SMITH, and is providing them.
Mr. HOPWOOD wants amendment of the Naval Discipline Act, like that we are to have of the Mutiny Act. Mr. Secretary EGERTON
does not see his way. It would not be like a Secretary of the Admiralty if he did. Why should he see his way better or further than
his masters? Though the Cats claws have been clipped, he is still kept in the boatswain's bag; and lurks in naval minds and naval
codes, setting up his back against change, and looking fondly back to the times when there was no limit, of law or practice, to his
fleshing his claws in the backs of our A.B.'s.
Mr. Smith brought in the Navy Estimates, as Colonel STANLEY did the Army Estimates the other night, to empty benches. This comes
of being so confoundedly early with things. Estimates clash with eating; and the House empties, that its Members may be filled.
Mr. SMITH shows a nominal reduction of near half a million, but admits that this is without reckoning the expenses of Čape trans-
port. We may reckon ourselves lucky if we get off with last year's Eleven Millions. As it is, the figures have been kept down chiefly
by, docking a thousand Marines; about the most improvident piece of docking, as it seems to Punch, that could have been done, as a
drilled and disciplined Marine is the valuable and costly product of a special and slow training.

'Tis not success that sends
Blood to the heart, and water to the eye,
That stirs all England to accordant cry,

To them that nobly win or nobly lose ?”
Not by deed's issue, but by deed we choose.
There is death in defeat,
That shows far nobler than victorious life.
Honour to those who weave their crowns of strife
In Peace's garland sweet,
But honour, too, to those whose crowns are clenched
In death-stark hands, with high hearts' life-blood drenched.
Take England's praise and thanks,
You, brave young officers, brave Rank and File,
Who beat back Zulu strength, foiled Zulu guile,
On Buffalo's bare banks,
A handful 'gainst a host, through a long night
Of desperate leaguer and unequal fight.
Take thanks and honour too,
You that, o'er-swept by sudden-surging waves
Of savage foes, in their slain heaps found graves ;
And of them chiefly, you,
Young pair of Paladins, who clave your way,
Bearing the colours from that fatal fray.

To wrap those Colours round his bleeding breast,
His, knee to knee to strive and strike his best,
O'er sand and thorough spate,
Ready whene'er from selle his comrade reeled,
To snatch that charge, which but dead hands would yield.
Through storm of shot and spear,
Red with their own and their pursuers' blood,
On, on, o'er steep and stone, on to the flood,
That rolls, storm-swollen, near
A lift, a leap, their horses breast the tide!
Strike shot, rain spear! with charmed lives they ride!
Alas, 'twas not to be.
Life's spark but lit them to the bank to die;
There, scarred with shot and assegay, they lie,
Side by side, peacefully.
The red flag round one heart of two that vowed
To save it take it, both, for common shroud.
This homage paid the dead,
Who could no more save life than honour lose-
Take England's thanks and praise, their well-earned dues
Who held that leaguered shed,
Setting Rorke's Drift, till now unhonoured name,
By Plassy and Assaye, and fights of fame.

which held its sixth annual meeting in Lincoln's-Inn Hall the

The commanding Officers of Militia Regiments are
obliged to keep a Diary, corresponding-mutatis mutandis

the principal events of the day. Now that Colonel-
Secretary STANLEY has reduced the annual training
to twenty days, the record will be more than usually
interesting. Mr. Punch keeps a prophet on his pre-
mises at 85, Fleet Street, and by his aid is enabled to

record will be materially benefited by the economy of

Tuesday,-Gaye the men their clothing, and took their
rags into store.
Wednesday: ---Fitting on uniforms. Very hard at
work all day with the regimental tailors,
Thursday. - First parade in uniform. Distributed
arms, and read the Mutiny Act. Thought of drill, but
it rained heavily, so dismissed the battalion.
Friday. — Squad-drill of an elementary character.
Officers lounged about doing nothing.
Saturday.-Inspection of clothing, and Saturday half-
holiday,
Sunday.-Church parade in the morning, and dismiss.
SECOND WEEK.
Monday. By order of the SECRETARY OF STATE com-
menced musketry course. Men drilled in aiming at
nothing in particular.
Tuesday:-Men still being drilled (by numbers) to aim
at nothing in particular.
Wednesday:—Wet day. Nothing doing. Battalion
dismissed at 10:15 A.M.
Thursday.-Musketry course continued. Blank-car-
tridge firing. Excellent joke for the men-rather slow
for the officers. Doctor has little or nothing to do now

Friday.–Target practice. Target hit once in every

HAT a reductio ad absurdum of our high scientific system of Naval

Monday, March 17 (Lords)-the Duke of SOMERSET showed,
with his usual coolness and clearness, what the wholesale destruc-
tion of life on board the Thunderer has shown quite as clearly, if
not quite as coolly, already, that with our complicated and costly gigantic guns, hydraulic loading, electric firing, and turret-mounting
arrangements, nothing is more likely than that the tell-tales may not tell their tales, the recording apparatus may not act, the electric-
firing machinery may miss fire, the hydraulic rammers may not ram, and the hydraulic washers may not wash, with the result of
blowing ship and crew to smithereens. To prevent this upshot of scientific progress, we have to depend on the perfect working of a
great variety of most elaborate and intricate appliances of steam, electricity, and mechanism, under a complicated system of signals,
worked by three sets of men, out of sight and hearing of each other. The wonder would seem to be, not that accidents do happen in the
best regulated turret-ships, but that they don't.
LORD ELPHINSTONE was eminently candid and clear in his account of how we load and fire now, and the way in which the accident
had probably come about, according to the unanimous conclusion of a pre-eminently scientific Committee. The only difficulty of the
Committee would seem to have been to choose, among the vast variety of ways in which the accident might have happened, the way in
which it most likely did happen-at least according to the best of their judgments-viz. because a second charge was rammed down
before the first was fired off. Henceforth, it is satisfactory to be assured that we are going “search” the gan after firing, to see
that it has been fired, and before loading, to see that we are out with the old charge, before we are in with the new. Are we going to
trust scientific tell-tales, again, for the intelligence, or is a wretched powder-monkey to be told off, to creep up the gigantic tube reeking

And stick to the Farm, as we've stuck to till now.
NOW
TO STRIKE
IT'S MY TURN
A BRITISH FARMER'S THOUGHTS AND
AFTERTHOUGHTS.
I'm an old British Farmer, and “Hereford bred,"
Though I've ne'er a white face, nor yet horns on my head.
I live quiet and snug, on a sizable farm;
And to never a neighbour I wish any harm.
Time was when, from sunrise till close of the day,
My spirits were good, as I paced the old way.
But nowadays things are unlike what they were.
If they rose from their graves, how our fathers would stare !
I once loved the life of a Farmer, but now
I'd as lief be a bullock, or horse at the plough;
Yes, as well be a turnip, kohl-rabi, or swede,
As go on a leading the life that I lead.
I remember the time when tight breeches and boots
Was a good enough dress for a grower of roots :
My father afore me, and his afore him,
Would have scorned to have put pantaloons on a limb.
But my Missus, says she, on one Sunday last year,
You can't go to Church in those garments, my dear.
No, John, I insist, to your room you 'll go back,
And put on a suit of respectable black."
So now every Sunday I walk by her side,
As black as a Bishop, to humour her pride.
My feelings, of course, I endeavour to smother ;
For when Madam says one thing, who dare to say t'other?
My daughters, Miss EMILY, SUSIE, and FANNY,
Have all been to school, and have learnt the Pianny;
And what with their music, fine dresses, and learning,
Won't tuck up their sleeves to do washing or churning.
My boys, Tom and Dick, ride in patent top-boots,
And no baccy will touch but cigars and cheroots ;
At a glass of good beer they turn up their nose,
For French stuff as sour as 'twere brewed out of sloes !
In long Ulster coats, like the men in the ark,
They run up to town on the “ spree," and the “lark:”
The money they spend on their pleasure, I'm sure,
Had better be spent on the farm in manure.
Then the taxes and rates! Win, or lose, all the same,
There's the Income-Tax Paper-I call it a shame :
Nay, it's worse than a shame, darned if 'tisn't a sin,
To take Income Tax out, when there's nought coming in !
Two guineas a quarter's the price of good wheat;
The market is full of American meat:
Says my landlord, “If barley and wheat doesn't pay,
Turn ploughland 'to grassland, and cultivate hay."
But I think of the days which won't come back again,
When a farmer could get a good price for good grain;
When taxes and rates were what folk could afford,
And we didn't build schools just to please the School-Board.
I know what I'll do, I'll just pack up my kit,
Sell my stock to my landlord, give notice to quit,
And take children and wife-(though perhaps they won't come) –
Across the Atlantic to seek a new home.
Yes, I'm off, bag and baggage! I'm tired o' taxation,
Free-trade, strikes, and unions, and co-operation.
PRESS REGULATIONS FOR OFFICERS COMMANDING
ARMIES IN THE FIELD.
1. THE General shall on
no account fight a battle
without first giving the
representatives of the
Press
fair notice, with a sketch
of his plan of attack, so
that correspondents may
have reasonable time to
telegraph the details to
their respective papers.
2. The General shall in-
variably consult Special
Correspondents in camp
on the time most con-
venient to them for open-
ing action. It will be
obvious that, unless this
be done, a great deal of
expense and trouble may
be caused in the London
newspaper offices.
3. No telegram shall be
sent by the General to the
Government without being
first submitted to Special
Correspondents.
4. The General should
see that Special Corre-
spondents are treated with
the utmost consideration, and that no invidious distinction is made
between them and combatant Officers. Guards should turn out to
them, and they should have the first choice of quarters.
5. Any Officer venturing to cut or cold-shoulder a Special
Correspondent, shall be immediately tried by drum-head court-
martial.
6. The preparation of despatches shall remain in the hands of the
General, subject to the control of the Special.
7. The General should be very cautious in allowing persons of
military training to act as Special Correspondents, as they are
apt to be biassed by professional prejudices and prepossessions.
Civilians are likely to bring the freshest eye and mind to
manouvres and other matters of a technical character.

I do not know; but within the first few minutes of our meeting in

adds mysteriously, as though I were, of course, in the secret, "you
know he can do something in a certain quarter."
Here he waggles
his hands, and nods his head at me like one of the German figures
on the top of a bon-bon box. Being evidently supposed to know all
about it, I nod and waggle back again, completing the resemblance,
on my part, to the bon-bon box figure by observing a discreet silence.
Mr. DENSON goes on to inform me, quite gratuitously, that his boy
has had an excellent education, and I catch myself replying,
Indeed!” in a surprised tone, which implies that I should not
have gathered the fact from the youth's manner and bearing.
“He was at Eton,” says his father, proudly.
“Near Eton," interposes his son, sullenly, and with marked
emphasis.
Well,” his father resumes, a trifle abashed, but maintaining a
smiling countenance, “at a most excellent school near Eton, where
they pursue the Eton system, and have matches like the Eton boys,
and go on the Eton grounds, and so one really may say he was at
Eton."
Of course I am ready to admit he may say anything, but I merely
bow politely, and observe, “Yes, naturally," which seems to chime
in quite pleasantly with Mr. Denson's notions.
"Then,” he continues, finding he has got a listener, "he went to

Only Boulogne,” interposes the lad, surlily.
Well," returns his father, deprecating the interruption, “that

“I don't call it so," mutters the boy, sulkily, “it's regular
English.”.
But it's in France," answers his father, triumphantly, which
statement even his son, whose mission is clearly to gainsay and
contradict his parent on every possible occasion, is compelled to
allow as being geographically true.
“He has studied for several examinations, but I have come to the
conclusion that business is the best thing for him," says Mr. DENSON,
Senior, winding up the subject somewhat abruptly, it having possibly
occurred to him that I am about the last person likely to be able to
forward his views as to his son's career in this particular line.
The lad is evidently favourable to any scheme not involving an
examination. He seems to be scanning me furtively, as though sus-
picious of my being an Examiner, in disguise, ready to tackle him
with a poser at a moment's notice. On being introduced to me,
formally, he shakes hands, as though he had not forgotten the time
when he used to hold out his palm for the cane, and, after with-

AN ALIAS FOR BUTTER.
FROM a Marylebone Police Report it appears that the
Slang Dictionary has been enriched if not with a new
word yet with an old word bearing a new sense. A
person was pulled up for selling as Butter, a mixture of
that material with 40 per cent. of animal fat not Butter.
This composition, sold under the name of Butter,
said to be what was known as 'Bosh.'”. Known, of
course, amongst Buttermen, and not to their cus-
tomers; a term of the trade : thieves' Latin. Beware
of Bosh, avoid and eschew Bosh of all kinds, but par-
ticularly Bosh the counterpart of Butter. As fine
words butter no parsnips, so neither can Bosh ; and just
now, when salt fish is in season, persons fasting on that
luxury should take special care that Bosh is not made
to do duty for Butter in their egg-sauce.
Experience and Wisdom.
HERE is a suggestive little cutting from a contem-
porary :

Lord HARTINGTON was for inquiry. The agricultural

where the pinch was. The Act was a dead letter, and
the Committee might bury it, with all the honours of a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Mr. O'CONNOR POWER took the wrongs of Zululand as
text for a “discoorse" on the wrongs of Ireland. He
entered his protest against the combined cruelty and
hypocrisy of English policy in South Africa.
Mr. GORST didn't see why Government should resign
if the House carried the Resolution. The fact was, that
the Government could always check the war-fever in a
Colony. They wanted to make the best of a bad case. Sir
BARTLE's was a very bad case. But if it hadn't been for
the disaster at Isandlana, they would never have heard
anything of a censure on Sir BARTLE. He should vote for
the Resolution. It would get rid of Sir BARTLE FRERE,
without doing any great harm to Her Majesty's Govern-
ment. (Defection number three.)
Sir W. V. HARCOURT said there was no fear of that.
The Government had laid down the principle that public
servants who had received the severest censure should
stay at their posts. Sir WILLIAM proceeded to cut up
Sir BARTLE and his Blue-Book, then to spit him on a sharp
and well-pointed argument, and finally to roast him at
a smart fire of effective epigram. The original mis-
chief was not the annexation of the Transvaal, but that
when we annexed it we did in Boerdom as the Boers
did. Sir BARTLE's arbitration was like NATHAN's de-
livering an ultimatum to NABOTH. He said the Zulu
lands must be given back, but that the wrongful occu-
piers must not be disturbed. He stood condemned by
his own words and deeds as well as by the Government
that employed him. His acts were just those a man
of experience, ability, and judgment would not have
committed. His despatches were alike devoid of logic,
temper, and dignity-mere special pleadings, in over-
charged language, in favour of foregone conclusions.
The Government could no more guide Sir BARTLE FRERE
than a small boy could prevent a four-year-old from
rushing at his fences. He was their Phaëton. They
had to look on while he set the world on fire in South
Africa. The censure they had ventured to send him was
praise in disguise, if actual encouragement had not
accompanied official reprimand. The Opposition by this
Resolution would discharge their consciences from the
intolerable burden of a policy which had brought us

It should have been better, yet might have been worse.
The man who of Ministers calls for most pity
Is hard-pressed Pill-Garlic, who carries the purse,
And has to conciliate the Court and the City.
Ah me! I have ne'er been allowed half a chance
To swell by one page the romance of finance !
On statistical wings it were pleasant to soar,
Make a Budget as thrilling as any new novel.
When GLADSTONE-but such sunny times are no more;
I must painfully potter and prosily grovel.
There is little to stir one to eloquence sweet
In the arduous effort to make both ends meet.
No sensation finance! Well, that's all very fine.
I appreciate safety and steady sobriety;
Fine phrases and fireworks are scarce in my line,
Yet a good bouncing Surplus would make a variety.
I could dream of a Budget that Bob Lowe bewilders,
And scrunches up GLADSTONE, and GOSCHEN, and CHILDERS.
That dream for the Beaconsfield régime reserves
Remission of taxes, and surplus and glitter :
But my course into Phæbus-like brilliance ne'er swerves ;
My Lord may plan coups, I'm the hapless cash-fitter.
For his games with the Afghan, the Zulu, the Turk,
I've to find the hard tin, and it's jolly hard work.
Your Imperial game is imposing, my Lord;
It imposes, at least, heavy loads on th’ Exchequer :
But bad trade at home and
big bounce all abroad
Would upset the plans of a GLADSTONE or NECKER.
What Budgets, though, might have been fashioned by me,
Had fate found me place under W. G.!
This time I did think I had made it all square;
I've had some strokes of luck in my favour. But, heigho!
My schemes have been spoilt by this Zulu affair,
And my balance upset by that beastly CETEWAYO.
Lord B. says 'twill be all serene, but as yet
All the credit seems his-I've to look to the debt.
Heroic finance I'm not free to essay;
The reverse would involve me in instant hot water

Who're too watchful by half, and would give me no quarter.

For Imperial airs, and the requisite raiment.

If that does not content them, it ought to amuse.

And for giving the Afghan and Zulu hot toko,
By a trifle of twopence a pound on Cigars,
And a-a-ah, to be sure-a small duty on Cocoa.
As for raising the Income-tax, that might tell tales ;
So there's only one method of trimming my scales.
I must play the Micawber, and deftly postpone,
I am free to admit it's a rôle I don't relish.
But I think it is safe, if they'll let me alone,

being always ready to learn, I inquire, in a comparatively off-hand
manner-
“But you keep cows, don't you ?”
After saying cows, it occurs to me that I ought to have said
“bullocks. Before I can move an amendment, that the words, “and
bullocks” be inserted, MOST YN DICKIE retorts-
“Well, my dear fellow, and what am I to get from cows ?”.
I consider. To reply, “Milk," seems absurd; and yet, what is
he to get from cows, if not milk? It can't be eggs; and it certainly
isn't mutton. There's cream ; but he must have the milk first.
Everyone is silent. MOSTIYN DICKIE has clearly put a poser.
“What is he to get from cows?” Nobody seems to know. Or if
every body knows, no one likes to make the evident answer, “Milk."
Young DENSON Junior, who has just emptied a dish of almonds
and raisins, says, sullenly, “Calves!”
His father stares at him, much as Balaam must have stared at his
donkey when it gave him a bit of its mind; then he looks round with
a supremely proud smile, as much as to say “There's a boy! Ain't
he wonderful! He'll get on-he will! Only give him a chance ! ”
"Well,” returns MOSTHYN DICKIE, as though not quite prepared
to admit the entire truth of the proposition. Well-yes-calves.
And how many calves ?"
"Depends on the cows,” says Denson Junior, taking a large bite
out of an apple.
His father is immensely delighted with his boy. What a career is
not before him? What obstacle is there that DENSON Junior will
not overcome? It is of such stuff as this that Chancellors are made,
for Chancellors have been boys once, eaten almonds, raisins, and
apples, and been none the worse for it-intellectually.
MOSTHYN DICKIE surveys the youth through his spectacles. He
is pleased-evidently pleased.
He's right,” he says, turning to DENSON, (who is immensely
gratified, and at once assumes such an air of superiority as is

This morning crossed the Dawb country-very little of which is
plain, and all the inhabitants coloured-in order to be introduced to
the celebrated HEZAN ARAJAH VALHALLAI BEEGCHUM, who, years
ago, had been an Englishman, but having been at an early age
taken up by the Natives, had lived in tents, had accustomed himself
to canvas, and become a naturalised Indian. Being naturally quick
and clever, with a certain touch of genius, he at once dissented from
the popular mode of worship as practised by the Hindoo and Mahom-
medan, and, taking a little from both, he proclaimed another prophet
in opposition to MAHOMET, whom he styled EGOMET. The Egomme-
dans hold illiberal opinions, but do not interfere with anybody as long
as they are allowed to do exactly as they please. The sect has been
of late years spreading widely; and it is now rare to visit any part of
India without coming across some of the Egommedans, or worshippers
of EGOMET. The temple is in the form of a gigantic Greek iota.

MONDAY,-Rose to “Rule Britannia”
from my private brass-band. Had roast-
beef, plum-pudding, and mince-pies for
breakfast, to which I invited the English
Minister of Finance. Had a long and con-
fidential chat with that intelligent foreigner.
Explained that I loved the English, re-
spected Queen VICTORIA, and worshipped
the Lord Mayor. Informed the Minister
that I had entered horses in my own name
for the Derby, and desired above all things
to be a member of TATTERSALL's. Suggested
a Cattle Show at Cairo in December, and
a University Boat Race on the Nile. Hinted
that France and England were natural ene-
mies, and that Egypt looked to England for
protection from France. Suggested that
the English Minister had a right to un-
limited backsheesh, and proposed a new
loan. The Minister listened to all I had to
say, and told me that he could only act in

the French Minister for Public Works.
Had a long and confidential chat with that
intelligent foreigner. Explained that I
admired the French, believed in all the
glories of France, and thoroughly appre-
ciated Republican Institutions. Informed
the Minister that I wished to be naturalised
a Frenchman, and desired to be buried in
Paris as the centre of civilisation. Hinted
that England and France were natural
enemies, and that Egypt looked to France
for protection from England. Expressed
my surprise that no attempt had been made
to wipe out the stain of Waterloo. Sug-
gested that a French Minister had just as
good a right to make his fortune on the
banks of the Nile as on those of the Seine,
and proposed a new loan. The Minister
listened to all I had to say, and told me he
could only act in concert with his English
colleague. Much annoyed. Gave my house-

The wedding to-day was to take place at Mehuggur, which is to

their young and devoted lovers.

Half-blinded by Imperialism's craze,
He knows not, hour from hour, what hated part
May be prepared for him by statecraft's art,
But loses hold on all his high traditions,
Prey to a policy of false positions.
POOR FELLAH!
Poor patient victim of a grinding yoke!
Mirth at thy piteous plight repents its joke.
Since Israel's children in the self-same land,
Under the harsh taskmaster's heavy hand,
Toiled, groaning at their toil in dumb despair,
What human beast such burden ever bare,
With limbs so weak, and sinews so relaxed,
By ruffians tortured and by rogues o’ertaxed ?-
O’erladen ever, whatsoever shift
Of rulers promises the load to lift.
The Turk long tortured thee; now East and West,
In cold co-partnership of interest,
Combine to crush thee with a double load.

Avails thee little yet, that hopest in vain
Mercy from Mammon, help from false chicane.

Bondholders beg, and wily statesmen dream,
Spouters declaim, philanthropists denounce,
But is thy burden lightened by an ounce ?

The bait, the bastinado, both bat tend
To the same issue of more toil for thee.

Of grasping greed, and infamous intrigue.

Or power unshackled with shrewd wrong to fight,

Mixed with the peddling plots of far-off lands,

Reaching all ways, yet ever unprepared.

A WORD TO THE CRAFT.
AMONG the candidates for one of the annuities in the gift of the
Freemasons, under his own obscurer name of RICHARD HENRY
MARSH, is Mr. HENRY MARSTON, so well-known to all London play-
goers of a few years ago, as one of the leading actors in the company
of SANUEL PHELPS, during the palmy days of Sadler's Wells Theatre.
In age and poverty, disabled by rheumatism from following his
profession, and with a wife and daughter dependent on him, he now
seeks the aid of that Masonic charity which never fails the deserving.
Punch has been asked, as one of the perpetual Grand Masters of the
Order, to urge the case on the attention of the brethren, and does so
with hearty good-will, in the name of good work well done, for
many'a year, in the cause of good Stage-Art, in one of its worthiest
and bravest enterprises.
Not so Easy.
ONE of the ceremonies at the consecration of a new Prince of the
Church, is that known as opening and shutting the Cardinal's
mouth." In Cardinal NEWMAN's case, the POPE won't find it so easy
to perform the latter operation. If he opens his mouth, he will do
to good purpose ; and if he shuts it, it will be, not at any third
party's bidding, but because he sees no good reason for opening it.

BELLS AND THEIR BAPTISM.
THE Author of Flemish Interiors, in a note on the
performance, in certain Protestant Churches of a cere-
móny called the “Blessing of Bells," informs us, re-
specting those sonorous summoners, that “in Catholic
countries they are still baptised.” 'In what way bells
can be any the better, or made capable of bettering
anybody, by their baptism, is a question perhaps not
to be asked in a country where it is customary to christen
the Queen's ships.
There are a few other inquiries, however, in refer-
ence to the baptismal rite as applied to either kind of
vessel, sonorific, or sailing or steaming, which we have
no reason to refrain from asking. What conditions
are needful to the validity of their baptism? Will lay
baptism, masculine or feminine, suffice for either in point
of orthodoxy, or is it absolutely necessary that the
christening of a ship should be performed by a lady
With what matter are bells to be baptised? Could wine
be used in the baptism of church bells; and would water
do to christen a man-of-war with ? Is intention on the
part of the officiating minister requisite for baptising
them effectually? Is there any controversy about their
baptismal regeneration? Of course, neither bells nor
ships have souls to be saved, and, as the former may
crack or topple down and get broken, whilst the latter
are not too apt to go to the bottom, baptism can scarcely
be supposed to contribute much to their temporal salva-
tion.
Whatever may be the good of baptising church bells,
would not as much good be done by baptising muffin-
bells, or dinner-bells, and other house bells? Might
not á town-crier as well get his bell baptisei? Would
it be reasonable to baptise dumb-bells ?
If there is any use at all in baptising ships and bells,
why not also baptise great guns? The Woolwich In-
fants, we fear, remain unbaptised, though not, perhaps,
in consequence of any peculiar views entertained at the
War Office touching Infant Baptism. Are Godfathers
and Godmothers usually required for the bells or the
ships to which baptism is administered, and are they
expected to stand any silver forks and spoons ?

ETURN of the Commons (Thursday,

quarters-not smiling. Weather

holiday has been as dreary as
its work before the holidays has
been wearisome and wasted.
First night was all question,
and no answer. It was astonish-
ing how many things Hon.
Members wanted to know which
the CHANCELLOR of the Ex-
CHEQUER could not tell them.
First, Mr. FAWCETT wanted to
know if MAUDE's Column had
been ordered to advance on Cabul.
Government didn't know, but
hadn't given any orders for such
advance.
(Sir BARTLE FRERE should have
taught them that the advances of
the servant are not always limited
by the orders of the master.)
Dr. KENEALY wanted to know
if Mr. Cross wasn't going to do
something for his unfortunate
Client. Mr. Cross did not mean
to reopen either the cell, or the
case, of the Claimant, who, we
fear, will soon be Clamans in
Deserto, in spite of the irrepres-
sible Doctor and his Hyde Park
Demonstrations.
Sir JULIAN GOLDSMID wanted to know no end of things. Whether
Mr. RIVERS Wilson had refused to take his discharge without con-
sent of his own Government. Whether the SULTAN had been asked
to give the KHEDIVE the sack. Whether the Government pro-
posed any, and what, action in Egypt in conjunction with France.
Ginx's Baby wanted to know whether papers, throwing light on
Egyptian darkness, would shortly be laid before Parliament, and
whether the Italian Government had made representations, or
expressed opinions on the subject.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER didn't know anything about

“So the Egyptian plague-spite of questioning close and unwearyin',-

Then Mr. FORSTER took his turn at the screw, but with no better
success in squeezing anything out of Sir STAFFORD.
The only thing in the East that won't get “mixed," seems to be
the occupation of Eastern Roumelia. That region has a mixed
population, a mixed vocabulary, a mixed coinage, a mixed cuisine,
a mixed toilette, mixed liquors, mixed biscuits, mixed pickles; but

occupation enough in stroking down or stirring up the Turks,
and stirring up or stroking down the Greeks, Bulgarians, and other
Christian subjects of the Porte.
On going into Supply, Mr. CARTWRIGHT temperately, but forcibly, presented the indictment against the Government for obtaining the
forbearance of Greece on false pretences; inducing her to refrain from open hostilities to Turkey by promises to back her claims on
Epirus and Thessaly, and then throwing her over-fobbing her off with the recommendation" of a rectified frontier at Berlin, and now
pointing out to her that the recommendation was not binding on anybody in particular, least of all on the Turks.
Lord E. FITZMAURICE supported the indictment.
Mr. GLADSTONE showed that to the long list of unredeemed pledges scored up against the present Administration must be added their
unfulfilled promises to the Greeks. He warned the Government that Greece had many friends in England, who were disgusted with the
treatment she had received, and would take an early opportunity of showing it. If Greek at home would not meet Greek abroad in a
better spirit, the tug of war would come with a vengeance. Let them carry out the one right requirement of the Berlin Treaty-the
rectification of Greek frontier.
The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER pleaded “not guilty”—or, rather, as the proceedings are civil, and not criminal-"in confession
and avoidance." Government were all for friendly relations of Turks and Greeks; thought a rectification of frontier necessary to
such relations; but thought the best road to such rectification would be by direct communication between the Powers. This they
were promoting, and hoped it would be successful.
“Hope springs eternal in the human breast.”
If, after all their disappointments in re Turk, the Government can still get up a hope out of Constantinople, it would be cruel to
throw cold water on it.
"Hope on, ye sanguine dreamers, while ye may,
Till the light comes, that drives all dreams away."
SIR CHARLES DILKE said hard things of the Government—that they were the worst obstacle in the way of the arrangement they
professed to be promotingMessrs. MONK, BAXTER, and SHAW-LEFEVRE followed suit; and Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT dressed up the
case against the Beaconsfield Cabinet and policy with the spice and sauce in the use of which he shows himself so consummate a chef. If
"he who peppers most highly is sure to please," Sir WILLIAM should be the most popular performer in the House.

“Willingly," I replied, foreseeing a little job on my own account,
or rather on his. It's a fine place, and would look well in a land-
scape. So I pulled out my box of paints, block, &c. “I'm ready,"
I said.
“So we,” he rejoined. “Here materials.".
And he pointed to twelve fierce-looking ebon slaves, each with a
bucket of gamboge-paint and whitewashing brushes.
“ What's this for?” I asked.
To paint palace with,” he answered, grinning from ear to ear.
“What!” I exclaimed, indignantly-* I, an artist, a-

RANGE-FINDERS AND RED-TAPISTS.
We are a practical people. At enormous cost of time,
pains, and money we provide our troops with the best
procurable rifle, and then we tell them to blaze away
with it as they best can-hit or miss-happy-go-lucky,
by movable sight or more movable guess, by rule of thumb
or rule of eye, as the case may be. And all the while, we
have had for years in the service little instruments called
"range-finders,” the invention of clever officers, easily
carried, simple, and uncostly of construction, ensuring,
with comparative certainty, that every bullet shall find
its billet, were a certain proportion of men trained to
use them and give the range to the rest. But we prefer
to go on in the old happy-go-lucky style, trusting to
eye-measurements of distance, which give yards of
error to the range-finder's inches.
Yes, we are an eminently practical people, meaning
thereby a people who get into and out of more scrapes
at more cost, and with more fuss, than any nation
of Europe. But the favourite field for display of our
practical superiority is the War Office. And the favourite
art of that Office is the art of shutting the door when
the horse is stolen, and throwing the cucumber out of
the window after spending the utmost pains and cost in
dressing it.
If you want proof of this, look for it in General WRAY'S

Yet Mr. James is so irresistibly droll as this Israelitish

of several hearty laughs-at intervals-will undoubtedly
get them at the Vaudeville. The best Scenes in the
piece are in the First Act, where the bashful Judson-

The contrast is striking, and the entire scene between

still funnier, and might be even true to nature, were
Mr. JAMES representing the sort of man I have just
named. But to be quite true to nature, Mr. Clench
would have kicked him out of the house. Even as it is,
Mr. BYRON has been forced into making Clench say,
aside, “I could strike him," or words to that effect,
and hesitate about accepting such a thorough-going re-
pulsive cad for his son-in-law, so as to tone down, to some
extent, the outrageous character of an amusing scene.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
But note-issuing banks are not to be allowed to re-register when
they have an establishment in any other part of the United Kingdom
than that where their principal office is situated.
This is a side-stroke at the Scotch banks established in London.
These Scotch banks, which are banks of issue, have, with Scotch
sharpness, stolen a march on the English banks, which are not per-
mitted to issue notes. The Scottish banking interest will kick, and
it is a strong one. But it is the deficiency of Scottish banking prin-
çiple which has upset the coach, and brought the law about the
bankers' ears.
The banking organs in the House generally, though guardedly,
approved the Bill. It is one of the few cases in which everybody
says that something must be done, yet in which the doing of some-
thing seems really necessary.
No doubt there will be an attempt made to limit the liability of
trustees by special provision.

Wood, and the list of the killed and wounded. Their Lordships

CHESTER, against the Duke of RICHMOND and the Marquises of RIPON
and HUNTLY, on the principle that should govern the taxation of
upland owners to prevent lowland floods. Their Lordships held
owners liable by 41 to 19.
(Commons.) The Zulu news received. Cheers for Colonel PEAR-
son's rescue. The House feels like JOHN BULL, that it has much to
be thankful for, nothing to be triumphant about. It hails the
not disastrous issue of the first stage of a business ill begun, with no
very visible good consequence in prospect.
For the choice of its Select Committees, the House prefers its Whips
to anything that the House can put in their place. Nothing like
knowing whips to head-back the bafflers and barkers, and see that
the staunch old dogs are well kept up to their work.
Mr. RITCHIE moved to introduce the small end of the protection-
wedge into the sugar-cask-in the shape of a Select Committee.
“Candid inquiry" is all the sugar-refining interest asks, of course.
But if the candið inquiry were to result in a proposal of a duty to

From muffled murmur to triumphant yell.
And Cæsar, though his sword be swift of stroke,
And his tense hands lay weight upon the yoke,
Yet, in the darkened chamber of his mind,

Of age-long tyranny ; its hopes have fed
On food you furnished when your hosts went forth
To fight for freedom, and so learn its worth.

CHETS MES
IN TRAVAIL OF A TRIBUTE.
It is too bad, because a man has a name
that sounds absurd, and has inaugurated
a Tribute that seems absurd to the States-
man of his idolatry, that he should be
charged with putting to the credit of the
people's pennies what is really due to their
wire-pullers' pounds.
Mr. TRACY TURNERELLI who, so far from
shirking observation, has shown the utmost
desire to direct the full blaze of publicity
upon himself and his doings, has published
** detailed statement" of sums received,
' exclusively for wreath” up to April 16th,
to the amount of £181 12s. 3d., in amounts
ranging between the magnificent £10 of
Bristol, with £7 98. 7d. as a second contri-
bution from that “London of the west,
-to Burstal's modest six bob, and Bir-
ley's cheerful eight-and-fourpence. This
record is followed by a list of towns which
have “guaranteed or promised, some £5,
some smaller sums," to the amount in all
of about £100,"dependent," as Mr. T. T.
cautiously adds, on promises given.
Towards Accessories," garnish, or trap-
pings of the Tribute, i.e., Casket, Address,
&c., the sum of £6 108. has been "contri-
buted by friends," who seem hardly to have
“parted” so freely as the friends of the
great T. T. the Tribute-founder might
have been expected to do.

ture of candour and exactness which charac-

is as follows:
“1. The Wreath, £220. 2. The Casket, £50.
3. The Illuminated Address, £15. 4. Outlay
made by Committee up to above date, £70.
Making a total absolutely required, £355."
Putting what is required against what
has been received or promised, we have as
result, Deficit £73 78. 9d.
A Deficit is not exactly the dominant
for a Triumphant Overture to close upon,
and, therefore, we cannot wonder if Mr.
TRACY TURNERELLI should append an ap-
peal and a suggestion in italics, to which
Punch is glad to give all the benefit of his
publicity, feeling that he owes Mr. T. T. at
least as much as this in return for the
Cartoon with which the T. T. T. last week
supplied him.
“ The Chairman trusts that a few other towns,
who have not yet sent in their names, will aid him,
immediately, by at least a small contribution, to
cover the above very trifling Deficit.
“ To ensure an early presentation, probably

the sum—the pennies for which may be collected

(a diet that gives the bacon here such a magnificent
favour), and revelling among the variegated colours of
the peacocks' outspread fantails, as they strutted about
the auburn gravel-path, or perched on the red sandstone
walls. The gorgeousness of the scene was mellowed by
the deep-toned bay of the mulliga-tawny watch-dog, as
it announced the arrival of strangers. Never before,
never since, have I beheld so fair, so strange, so en-

A QUESTION TO BE ASKED.
“Sir W. FRASER asked the Vice-President of the Privy Coun-
cil whether his attention had been called to the evidence taken
at the inquest on the body of EMILY HULBERT, who died of
glanders, showing that a younger sister died of the same disease,
and that fourteen glandered horses had been kept and sold by
Bacon, cab-proprietor, of Colville Mews, Bayswater, and
whether he considered the system of inspection of cab-horses,
particularly as regards night use, to be effectual.
“Lord G. Hamilton explained that the case referred to had
been under the consideration of the Privy Council, whose chief
veterinary inspector had investigated it. As the result of this
investigation, and that of the Medical Officer to the Board of
Health, the local authorities had decided to prosecute Mr. BACON
for frequent violations of the regulations laid down in the Act
of last year. The inspection of cab-horses was not within the
province of the Privy Council, but within that of the Home
Office."
Why exalt Hygiene to the Heavens,
To hold inquests on the corses
Of babes, packed, sixes and sevens,
Over stalls full of glandered horses ?
Turkish horrors no one excuses,
And Russ rule is not the thing;
But of glandered children our Mewses
Have got their own song to sing !
And it isn't a pleasant song
For a people great in the Arts,
And in the Sciences strong,
And with what's called "blood" in their hearts.
And as Punch breathes the Mewses' breath,
And hears of our careful inspection

(Lords, Monday, April 28.)
TIEN Lord Bury had snubbed Lord Truro for asking more questions about
range-finders, he gave General WRAY something as like the lie for speaking
the truth as a young War-Office official could give an old General. The
art of official answering has been very conspicuously illustrated this Session.
Lord BURY seems to have even bettered Lord SALISBURY's instruction.
The
sufferings of cattle in sea-transit exercised the humanity of Earl
DE LA WARR,
and the explanatory euphemism of the Duke of RICHMOND,
He declares the arrangements for cattle-carrying between this country and
the United States are most satisfactory, but that the Atlantic will take liberties, and that “accidents will occur in the best-regulated
ventilating apparatus."
It is a great comfort to think the poor bullocks are being looked after ; but how about John Bull, in transitu across the Channel
,
when the double-ship is not running !
Lord STRATHEDEN wants to make the Militia moveable. He forgets what it has cost us to make the Army mobile.
" Donna e mobile, my Lord, if you like” (says Lord BURY) but not Militia-man. He "savours of the soil," as the old law phrase
ran, and can only be shipped over sea, at his own good pleasure, as a volunteer; and there are always plenty of Militia regiments to

BISMARCK. So far from being one of
the Seven Sleepers, he, and those

Lord AIRLIE said that Lord BATE-

The Duke of RUTLAND went as far
as Lord BATEMAN, and a good deal
farther. Free Trade meant national
ruin. So far from believing with
Mr. BRIGHT that the distress in 1842
was ten times as bad as now, he be-
lieved the distress now was ten times
as bad as in 1842. Landlords and
tenants were going to smash on all
sides. And no wonder. The more
wheat we grew, the more wheat other
countries would grow; and the more
cattle we raised, the more cattle would
be imported. Ergo : The cheaper
bread and beef got, the worse off we
should be. In short, everybody was
being shipwrecked, and the only life-
buoy was "Protection."
Lord DUNRAVEN submitted that
bad seasons, idleness, drunkenness,
improvidence, wars and rumours of
wars, standing armies, and strikes
might together have more to do with
bad times than Free Trade. Lord

OUT OF RANGE. 22
LORD BURY has attained a rare and rapid
proficiency in the great official arts of
snubbing and sneering. The other night
Ya pua
he snubbed Lord TRURO for being curious
about Range-finders, and General WRAY,
for saying that only twenty-one sets had
been served out to the Infantry. He began
by sneering at General Wray as some-
what of an enthusiast:"-
"He was formerly Chairman of the Committee
on Range-finders, and, like many persons who
took up a crotchet somewhat warmly, he was
extremely enamoured of all the recommendations
made by his Committee."
Now, seeing that this Committee had
tested the effect of Range-finders, and
found that their adoption meant accurate
firing instead of random, the unofficial
mind would be apt to conclude that General
WRAY's eagerness to see Range-finders
brought into use was rather to his credit
than otherwise.
But Lord BURY ingeniously
makes it appear that the General is a trou-
blesome and conceited person, who is only
angry because "a great many details re-
commended
by the Committee had not com-
mended themselves to the judgment of those
responsible for the administration of the
service, and had consequently been re-
jected, after the Committee's central re-
commendation for the adoption of Range-
finders had been carried out.
So far is this from being the case, that
General WRAY, finding the formal adoption
of the Range-finder at the War Office had
not been followed by its adoption in the
Infantry, writes to the Times to say so.
Lord BURY calls this, in the regular
official style, “devoting a portion of his
time and talents to writing letters to the
newspapers against the War Office," and
then proceeds to expose General WRAY'S
recklessness of statement:-
“General WRAY maintained that only 21 sets
of Range-finders had been ordered in alt. Now,
Handy
the fact was, that 179 sets had been ordered, and
there would have been 279 ordered had not Cap-
tain Watkin desired 100 of them to be kept back
in order that he might introduce into them some
slight improvements which he had invented.
Range-finders had been ordered in considerable
numbers, and 179 had been either ordered or
served out to the troops. General WRAY had
evidently omitted from his calculations the Artil-
lery Range-finders, and considered only those
served out to the Infantry."
It will hardly be believed, in the face of
this crushing exposure of the wretched
General, that General WRAY's statement
was, precisely, Lord BURY's admission, that
only twenty-one sets of Infantry Range-
finders had been served out - Infantry

PATERNAL PUNISHMENT.
A CLAUSE in the new Mutiny Act,
identical with one in the old, awards
capital punishment to any soldier who
"misbehaves or induces others to
misbehave in manner in this Act not
specifically mentioned." This, ac-
cording to Major NOLAN, is popularly
known in the Army as the Devil's
Clause.” Empowering Courts-Mar-
tial to punish an obnoxious party for
an offence created for the nonce by
judge-made law, perhaps may appear
extremely diabolical to civilians; yet,
certainly, an inclination to administer
justice in such sort is not entirely
peculiar to the military mind. Per-
haps it would be rather too often ex-
emplified in the sentences of ecclesi-
astical tribunals if the presidents
were Clergymen authorised to convict
accused persons of heresy or miscon-
duct for deeds and doctrines “not
specifically mentioned in any legal
document, but decided in Court to
be wrong or false dogmatically, off-
hand. Of course it would not do to
say that a condemnation of that kind
was a judgment pronounced under
a “Devil's Clause," although, to be
sure, the victim of it might well be
pitied as a poor devil.

SALISBURY ON THE SITUATION.
(At the Biennial Banquet of the Middlesex Conservative Registration
Association.)
SIR CHARLES, and the rest,-in your presence my attitude
Is one of profound and unspeakable gratitude.
We've been five years in office : foes wish our removal ;
But while we retain your support and approval,
We stand in small fear of that fractional faction
Whose only desire is to hamper our action.
We found England's honour a-tremble, like jelly,
Now 'tis firm as Mount Atlas,-just ask TURNERELLI.
We've shown “proper pride,” as the servant-girls say,
When they're sore at not having it all their own way.
We know our right place-at the top-and have taken it,
And snarling of Russians or Rads has not shaken it.
You wise men of the South like our course in the East
(That up North they 're such noodles is funny, at least).
You 're awake to the Nation's true honour and glory,
Intelligent, loyal-in short, truly Tory.
Foes say we ’re aggressive. Such malice one scorns ;
But we're bound to hit out if men tread on our corns-
Or interests-and we've so many of those,
That we cannot let strangers step too near our toes.
That Bulgarian business? I will not revile
Those Britons whom Turkish atrocities rile.
They 're the noblest of fellows,-the silent ones, namely ;
But as for their spokesmen, the few who fought gamely
On platforms, in pamphlet, and speech, why, their action
Was simply the outcome of blackguardly faction.
They pooh-poohed our advice to our client the Turk,
And helped him our claims and his duties to shirk,
Till my delicate counsels he would not pay heed to,
And, - but stay, where the deuce will this argument lead to ?
I will not pursue it, but simply remark
Bulgarian's bite may be worse than Turk’s bark,
Though to say so may make hot philanthropy gush.
Then as for our Treaty. I care not a rush
What the Rads or what REUTER may say; we intend
By that compact to hold like grim death to the end.
We have given up lots, some may fancy too much,
But let them look out who our Treaty would touch!
If we stick to our text, 'tis our earnest and sure hope
The Turk will yet turn out a blessing to Europe.
Now then for home politics! What would you do
If the Libs should come in? They're the raggedest crew.
There are scarce two among them subscribe the same credo,
So they cannot pull sweetly together, as we do.
(Lord DERBY? Pooh pooh !-a good riddance, of course.
Eh! The Derby-Day's near $ Yes, but he's not the horse.)
Lord HARTINGTON? Squeezeable! Leaders who yield
To their followers, fail in a well-stricken field.
No, GLADSTONE-yes, goose him !-will rally, and then
With his henchmen, those smart but most pestilent men,
Messrs. Fawcett and CHAMBERLAIN, he'll make it hot;
And the country will go at express pace to pot.
We, we are the men, and your duty is plain,
Ne'er to let gushing GLADSTONE befool you again.
But keep in (for a little while longer) Lord B.,
And after him, hand the reversion to me!

Secretary for Foreign Correspondence.
He prepares all the letters, invitations, diplomas, and compli-

Sovereigns and Ambassadors, and to the Honorary Foreign Acade-
micians. He devotes one morning a week to this duty; and has a
small table set apart for his use (with dictionaries, &c.) in the
Lecture-room. Privately he renders inestimable service to the
Academicians and Associates by assisting them in their correspond-
ence with foreign purchasers, critics, and connoisseurs, with the
principals of the scholastic establishments at which their sons and
daughters may be receiving their education, and with the pro-
prietors of furnished houses and lodgings when the time arrives
for visiting the various agreeable sea-side resorts with which the
Continent of Europe abounds.
The Honorary Members receive no salary, and there are no great
perquisites attached to their offices, for the beautiful old custom of
presenting them with early dew gathered on May morning by the
two junior Associates and the Secretary has been for some time in
abeyance. They are invited to the Annual Dinner and Evening
Receptions; tickets of admission to the Exhibition, as also to the
Winter Lectures and Winter Exhibition of Old Masters, with copies
of the Catalogues (the 1s. 6d. edition), are sent to them by the hands
of the Academy Beadles; and they have the privilege (by which they
may be readily recognised) of entering the galleries with a stiek or
umbrella in their hands,-a privilege which is not extended to their

it-must be admitted to be a cheerful one. But the more common
view, we fear, comes nearer the mark. Like another celebrated
subject of the hangman's high art, who, as the poet sings-
“Oft fitted the halter, oft traversed the cart,
And often took leave, and was loth to depart,"
the Berlin Treaty seems-not to put too fine a point on it-in no hurry.
Inter alia, Lord SALISBURY tells us a Commissioner has been
sent to Asia Minor to ascertain the reasons for local reforms there-which, however, cannot be carried out till the Turkish finances are
upon a better footing”!

And noise won't ease my grave misdoulting.

I want to see how things are going;
When times are hard and business flat,
You can't set matters square by crowing.

MERRY May as Christmas cold !
Thunder, lightning, hail and rain!

to paint him not only not so black as he
really was-the old beast !-but actually
to represent him as a gentlemanly creature
in evening dress, and decoré, instead of
being a half-clothed, under-bred, vulgar

than decorum. I give a graphic illustra-
tion, which tells its own story.

“You pay me sittee ?” he asked.
I was up to him, the old rogue.
“I couldn't think of insulting the great

But the Guards had not received their commands to carry arms, and the old reprobate
himself was armed with a double-barrelled gun; and I confess that, spite of all my British
pluck, the way he handled the weapon, sighting it in a line with the back of my head, and
then aiming it at different parts of my anatomy, did cause my hand to shake a little occa-
sionally. But I held on. I polished him off, under pressure, in three hours, and then I left
him, admiring himself like a sardine preserved in oil.
While he was intent on the picture, I stole out. Not one of the Guards dared move.
Indeed, having been for two hours in this strained position, presenting arms, they had be-
come as stiff as wax-work figures; and as old TIPPOO TOPPEE's gun had long since
dropped from his hands, there was nothing to fear. I must tell the sequel.
The wretched old dog, thinking I was still in the room, and forgetting that his soldiers
formed three sides of a square, two of which were pointing at each other, and the third at
himself, suddenly called out, "Fire !"
His voice restored their energy. Obedience with them was a first duty. They fired. The
picture was riddled through, and poor TIPPOO TOPPEE got two or three nasty ones-stingahs,
as they call them here, which made him jump up in the air, and turn round several times
before he sat down again.
The other Guards, thinking they were all dead men, tumbled down, but finding that
they could move with perfect ease, they arrived at the conclusion-which was corroborated
on surgical examination—that they had not been wounded. The bullets were all found in
their turbans.

But the strength of “The Force,”
Will be taxed to the utmost of footman and horse
By this crowd of obstructives—a regular block !

Prompt to strike and to chivey, that pair, if close pressed !-

protested against the notion of curing the cruelties of
TETEWAYO, or any other savage monarch, by inflicting
upon his subjects the horrors of war; and spoke, as Mr.
GLADSTONE might be trusted to speak, in favour of the

policy of moderation.
Whereupon Sir R. PEEL, feeling a natural disinclination
to see the wind taken out of his sails, rose, in the character

of Portia, and rivalled Mr. BRANDRÁM in his recitation of
the Mercy Speech. Sir ROBERT seems to feel much for
CETEWAYO, and Punch quite agrees with him that if the
House wishes to see the honour of the country maintained
it also wishes to see mercy exercised.
Sir CHARLES DILKE said that the House did not yet see
the reasons of the Government change of front; and Sir
M. H. BEACH declared that it was quite a mistake to
say that Sir BARTLE FRERE had been thrown over-he
had only been superseded, wherever we were at war and
in a difficulty. He is still High-Commissioner at Cape
Town.
We have only sent Sir GARNET to take his place, after
he has put himself out of the latitude of “Good Hope.”

INDIAN NOTES AND QUERIES.
PEACE with honour again! Hooray! Peace with
Afghanistan. Not peace at any price. Peace at the
price of only sixty thousand a year subsidy to YAKOOB
KHAN. Can Sir GARNET WOLSELEY have received
instructions to conclude peace on the same terms, if
possible, with CETEWAYO ?
Peace for India at a pretty considerable price !-but
with something to show for it. A scientific frontier,
into the bargain. An effectual bar to the advance of
Russia at quite a moderate price. Cheap defence of
nations !
But suppose now, Mr. Bull, we were in the place of
the Russians, and the Russians in ours; they being on
the Indian side of our scientific frontier and we on the
other: we knowing what we have now come to know
about the value of our Indian possessions. Should
we in that case, think you, cherish any designs upon
India ? Shouldn't we rather, in the event of any
rumpus with Russia, think it well for us that the occu-
pation of India employed a large portion of the Russian
army, and withheld all that number of Russian troops
out of the way? Should we desire in the least to
deprive the Russians of India ; or should we, on the
contrary, be most decidedly disposed to allow the Czar
to preserve his Indian Empire unmolested, and wish
him joy of it?

DICKENS'S DICKENSIONARY OF LONDON.
(Notes for a Happy-Thought Guide-Book to London.)
An Unconventional Handbook which, as a Chatty Guide to our Metropolis,
is well worth the outlay of a shilling. 'The visitor to London will find that
he has secured in Mr. CHARLES DICKENS the companionship of that invaluable
person known on the Stage as Charles his Friend. Much wisdom is displayed
in its arrangement, as for
instance when the reader, wishing to know where
he
can purchase a carriage in London, refers to the heading "Carriages,” he will
find
“CARRIAGES.-(See HORSES.)
Isn't this wisdom? Isn't this CHARLES his Friend's most friendly way of
delicately giving the very best advice? It means, of course,
“ first buy your
horse, then get your carriage. Do you know the cost of a horse ? of its keep?
No? Then wait till you 've just gone into that subject, my friend. Anyway,
adds CHARLES, that is, by implication, “in my Guide-book everything's done
in order, and I don't put the cart-I mean the carriage-before the horse.”
To read aloud this item “CARRIAGES.-(See HORSES),” sounds to the lis-
tener like a wrinkle for the Aquarium. Of course a carriage for sea horses
would be fitted with “C springs."
The reader will also be amused by referring to CHARLES his Friend's notice
of Boodle's Club. He says,
“Repeated applications have failed to elicit any reply from the Secretary.”
Fancy the Repeated applications ! Here we are again, every morning, at
the Secretary's Office. Poor CHARLES his Friend had a bad time of it. How-
ever the joke doesn't end here. Proceed with “B,” and see what CHARLES says
about Brooks's Club. Then let us take another B'in CHARLES's hive :-

Of pearls great Punch would call ?
To Punch all Girls are sweet as sweet,
Brunette or blonde, grande or petite.
He throws himself at their fair feet,
And loves 'em, short or tall.
Merry or earnest, plump or slim,
Well-rounded charms, or svelte and trim,-
Bless you! it's all the same to him!
He loves 'em, great and small.
Clear eyes of gray, and azure blue,
Brown, hazel, black, and sapphire too;
And Irish eyes of violet hue-
Punch loves 'em, one and all.
All locks he loves, in tress or braid,
Front-frizzled, rough, or smoothly laid,
Black, brown, and gold, of every shade,
Since Evé first let hers fall.
Sweet noses, be they short or long,
“Tip-tilted'" (as in Laureate's song),
Straight, aquiline-not one comes wrong-
On Punch they never pall.
Full lips that pout, shy lips that smile,
Proud lips that curl, sly lips that wile;
All lips can Punch's heart beguile
At drum, or rout, or ball.
So Punch each lovely damsel greets;
And vows that while his true heart beats,
He loves not one, but all he meets,
In palace, cot, or hall!

Spring. Ha ! ha! My disguise, I conceive, is perfection.
Summer. Ho! ho ! Who would recognise Summer in me?
Spring. I leave poor mankind in the deepest dejection.
Summer. I doubt if my advent will fill 'em with glee.
Both. We've frozen 'em, drenched 'em, and cut off their sun,
Till they 're getting quite desperate. Isn't it fun ?
Spring. The Seasons ? Ha! ha! Sounds ironical, very.
Summer. An ancient distinction that's obsolete quite !
Spring. Ho! ho! Why they used to consider me merry!
Summer. And I was the blooming, the balmy, the bright!
Both. But the lyres of the poets are both out of tune,
And December 's no more like December than June.
Spring. Just look at my nose! 'Tis as blue as old Winter's !
Summer. Twig my gingham and macintosh-pluvial, eh?

Summer. Rare lark! Only choice between deluge and ice !

" À BERLIN!”
The following gifts, offered to the Emperor and Empress of
GERMANY at the recent Golden Wedding at Berlin, by some mistake
have not yet appeared in the official list of presents. From-
The Emperor of Russia.-A suit of chain-armour (to be worn
under a General's uniform), warranted dagger and bullet-proof, and
a guide-book to Siberia.
The President of the French Republic.-A Slang Dictionary, com-
piled by the members of the Corps Legislatif, and edited by M. Paul
DE CASSAGNAC.
The Sultan of Turkey.-Contrivances for floating loans in the
event of national shipwreck.
The Khedire of Egypt.-A donkey-whip, and a patent screw
press, adapted for pressing cotton and squeezing fellahs.
Prince von Bismarck.-
A patent gag, warranted to keep everybody
quiet-for a time.
The Earl of Beaconsfield.-A golden wreath. (Idea borrowed
from TRACEY TURNERELLI.)
The ex-Queen of Spain.—A copy of the old English air, “ Darby
and Joan," arranged for the castanets.
The Prussian Press.-A pair of rose-coloured Spectacles.
Mr. Holms, M.P.-An Essay by himself, entitled The Military
Systems of England and Germany, from a Hackney point of view.
The German Nation. A complete set of Good Words.
And Mr. Punch.-A ditto of good wishes.
VERY QUESTIONABLE.—Whoever attempts to rule the Irish Home-
Rule Party, will he ever be other than a Butt-for all manner of
arrows, poisoned and otherwise ?
NAUGHTY PEOPLE.—The Nihilists.

WHAT'S THE GOOD OF IT?
A “GUILD" has been started calling itself “the
Church and Stage Guild.” Its object is somewhat
difficult to define. It is intended to include all
“who profess the Christian faith, and are not
ashamed of it on the Stage. By the way, if the
members consult ALBAN BUTLER's Lives of the
Saints, they will find at least three Actors in the
Calendar. “If the Guild goes on being very good
indeed, future generations may read in the Chris-
tian hagiology The Life of the Blessed Buckstone,
The Acts of Saint Benjamin (Webster), and a
Bollandist history of the Venerable J. L. Toole.
Already as eminent confessors of the Christian
faith, the names of some members of the talented
Vokes family appear in the Guild, with Mr. FRED
ALBERT of Music-Hall celebrity. The Committee
list has been issued, of course, “ with power to
add to its number,' and so we may soon expect

​to know. Lord BEACONSFIELD, who has put
the Canon in position, is quite satisfied that
his great gun is good, as well as great. The
Archbishop of CANTERBURY is not quite so
cock-sure, but seems to think that the
Canon has fired—I. e. voted-without being
any the worse for it, and must, on the
whole, be taken to be a good and sufficient
Canon. Altogether, their Lordships got up
a lively debate on this momentous question,
on whose darkness Punch does not even
profess to throw light, himself seeing none.
The debate supplied á peg for a very self-
complacent speech from Lord BEACONSFIELD,
in which he had the pleasure of making
out that he was quite right, and everybody
else quite wrong, and somehow left the
impression that the Dean and Chapter of
York were a remarkably muddle-headed
body-the very reverse of what we should
expect from a Yorkshire Chapter.
Lord TRURO wants a civil element in the

What we should rather fear is, that it may

Lord GALLOWAY groaned over the lament-
able fact that, when the British Army was
in a state of collapse, nobody could come to
its rescue with any more effective stimulant
than Inquiry.

inquiry, and that soldiers were the proper

​fifty-four. Mr. J. HOLMS supported, 80 did Mr.
RYLANDS. Mr. J. BROWN suggested a maximum of
twenty-five stripes. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN was against
flogging altogether. Sir W. HARCOURT was afraid it
could not be dispensed with. But why should not the
Secretary of State schedule floggable offences ? Sir R.
PEEL and Sir H. HAVELOCK jumped at the suggestion
Colonel STANLEY said he would it he could.
After a fresh wrangle, whether this should be accepted
as concession enough, Mr. BRIGHT rose to remind the
House that the punishment fell heaviest in its first stage,
after which the tearing of the Cat was comparatively
unfelt. That was a reason for reducing the maximum of
stripes. The offender would still get the hottest and
heaviest half of his punishment.
Mr. MacDonald and Mr. O'DONNELL were for killing
the Cat altogether-cutting off a few of his tails was
not enough. When even Colonel MURE and Colonel
ALEXANDER supported the reduced tale of stripes, Colonel
STANLEY was fain at length to yield.
Henceforth only twenty-five lashes at most can be laid
on the Soldier's back.
But what lashes shall they be? Mr. HOPWOOD moved
that the stripes should be given by an instrument " of
not more than one thong or tail. This Lord ELCHO
thought a reductio ad absurdum ; and brilliantly sug-
gested the insertion of “Manx" before “Cat,” as Manx
cats have no tails.
The Marquis of HARTINGTON thought his honourable
friends had better not push their point too far. If
Government was not to be trusted to choose a Cat, what
was it good for? Ultimately, the Committee came to
the same conclusion, after this very lively night on the
tiles, by 164 to 54.
Sir W. HARCOURT moved for papers in connection with
recent cases in which the opinions of their Councils here
and in India had not been taken, or had been unconstitu-
tionally overridden, by the SECRETARY of STATE for
INDIA here, and the VICEROY out there. Sir W. pressed
his charge home moderately but forcibly, and made out
a very dead case against the Government. He depre-

they gave him.

REASONS FOR REPEAL OF COTTON DUTIES.
(Ten to One—as offered freely by Lord S-SB-v.)
i. Because the Governor-General knew a good deal more about
the matter than his Council.
2. Because the Secretary for India knew a great deal more than the
Governor-General.
3. Because it was important to over-rule economic error.
4. Because the opportunity seemed a particularly happy one.
5. Because the glorious principles of Free Trade have ever been
dear to the Conservative Statesman.
6. Because the Corn Laws had been repealed solely on this under-
standing
7. Because economic truth is eternal, and must prevail.
8. Because it was an act of wisdom, if not of statesmanship, to
insist on this at a moment when the Indian Treasury was giving
signs of collapse.
9. Because noble Lords in Opposition were given to tergiversations
and evolutions.
10. Because when Lord SALISBURY was at the India Office he had
been known often, out of mere zeal for his charge, to shout out
“Perish England !” in his sleep.
But not (11) Because the Government were anxious to secure the
Lancashire Vote at the next Election.
COULEUR DE ROSE.
(The Chancellor of the Exchequer at the Banquet of the Tower
Hamlets Conservative Association.)
MR. CHAIRMAN, and Ladies and Gentlemen,—this
Is a moment of moments, pulsating with bliss.
'Tis with pride and with pleasure I rise to respɔnd
To the toast you received
with a rapture so fond.
It is also, believe me, with pleasure and pride
That I greet this large muster of friends to our side.
In fact pride and pleasure" are words I'd beseech
Your permission to take as the text of my speech.
I'm of optimist tastes, as the country well knows,
And my views about most things are couleur de rose :
So the alliteration is much to my mind.
'Tis with pride and with pleasure I see you so kind;
'Tis with pleasure and pride that I think of your Mint,
And your Trinity House has the same rosy tint.
As I passed its Almshouses to-day on my ride,
I surveyed the fair structure with pleasure and pride.
Then your Tower again-pray excuse that slight sob,
Every Briton must feel a peculiar throb
At the name of the Tower! With pleasure and pride
I may say that we mean the Tower gates to throw wide
Two hours more to the public on every free day,
During Summer-if ever we get one. !“ Hooray!")
Yes, that's nice, is it not? But there's more p.p. get.
This meeting's a Party one. Do I regret ?
No! I like Party meetings-when all on one side ;
And I look upon this one with pleasure and pride.
Yes, I like Party spirit. But faction I hate.
They're quite different-how, it is needless to state ;
But I may say, with pride and with pleasure, that we
Never stoop to the latter, in any degree.
It is only minorities, long out of place,
That offend in that way, to their lasting disgrace;
And whenever minorities venture on action,
'Tis plain they're inspired by the spirit of faction.
But of all things what gives me most pleasure and pride,
Is to see the majority ranged on our side.
We have had trying times, as the old women say,
And to deal with the crisis has not been child's play.
We may have made blunders, but then, after all,
Like the lady's faux-pas, they have been "very small.”
Whilst day after day has been big with the fate
Of-Lord B, and of Britain-a critical state!
But our Chief has dodged danger, avoided defeat-
So Conservative Choirs may sing large and sing sweet,
While discomfited Rads may sing sour and sing small --
None will dance to their tune, though they keep up their bawl.
But Lord B.'s firmness, courage, and energy-(cheers) –
Might move brawny BISMARCK to envious tears.
There is still work before us. But things in the East
Are settling down nicely-I think so, at least.
We have crumpled the Afghan, and baffled the Bear.
The African bungle we'll very soon square-
(Though I do not quite like that half-million a week!) —
And then we can boast, sans suspicion of " cheek,
We have brought you back Peace. As for snarlers who say
That we were the parties who drove her away,
I hope I am not over-sanguine in thinking,
At the hustings, you'll see them disposed of like winking.
For Home-legislation we've had little leisure,
But I think I may say–with as much pride as pleasure-
That England has ne'er from her dignity swerved.
Though her trade's in a pickle, her honour's preserved.
Distress? Humph, well-yes; but don't take that to heart.
We shall soon set
things right
when we make a fresh start.
Let us hope that Prosperity's full rays may soon shine
Though just now talk of sunshine sounds rather like moonshine.
At least I may mention- with pleasure and pride-
That the blame for bad times does not rest with our side.
There's one fly in my ointment, one thorn in my rose-
Obstruction ! But there, never mind. I suppose
I was born a Pill Garlick; at school 'twas the same;
Boys shied books at my head, and I got all the blame.
And now that the Home-Rulers pelt me, of course
"Tis set down to my lack of discretion and force.
No matter. Return lots of Members like him-
(Mr. RITCHIE, I mean)—with a stern-wind we'll swim,
And on waves of prosperity buoyantly ride,
With no check to our pleasure, no curb to our pride !

Suggestions for Swains.
It is said that wheat is ceasing to repay the Farmer for cultiva-
tion. He is therefore recommended to rear cattle instead. This
would be a transition from the Georgics to the Bucolics, and, if
accompanied by a return to pastoral simplicity of living, might
make the Farmers once more “Felices nimium, sua si bona norint.”

LIGHT OUT OF DARKNESS.
QUERY, How to convert motion into
electricity, so as to be enabled to generate
the electric light at a moderate cost? By
means of waterfalls, windmills, and tidal
rivers, answer scientific economists. Good.
But is there not another motive agency
which could be very cheaply and readily
supplied ? Couldn't you get it out of con-
vict labour ? By the simple expedient of
connecting our cranks and treadmills with
electro-magnetic machines, a quantity of
force convertible into electric currents, and
thence into light, might be obtained pro-
portionate to the strength of criminals in
custody. Thus the moral darkness of the
country might be made to afford the means
of physical illumination; as is the darkness
so would be the light-very great. Isn't
this a pretty as well as a scientific idea ?
In the meanwhile you would put rogues,
thieves, and ruffians to some real use, and
make them do something for their molasses,
skilligolee, and cell-accommodation, with-
out forcing prison labour into injurious

tion of opposing the rest of the Bill. It was a famous chance of
winning popularity.
Colonel STANLEY said his object was to limit the very unlimited
powers of the Provost-Marshal.
There was a long fight over the Enlistment Clauses. Finally, power
was given to extend the period of enlistment from six to twelve years.
Mr. O'DONNELL moved, in the teeth of all reason, to omit the
words forfeiting a man's previous service, for desertion, fraudulent
enlistment, and other heinous offences, in the count of time towards
pension. On which Mr. BIGGAR talked the House out.
The morning's talk-out was followed by a Count Out in the
evening. “Thus bad begins, but worse remains behind."
Wednesday.-A serious and interesting adjourned debate over
Second Reading f the O'CONNOR Don's Irish University Bill,
notable for new departures of some leading Liberals in the direction
of concessions to Irish ideas. Professor PLAYFAIR, for one, evidently
inclined in this direction, though he could not support this Bill, which
would constitute a theological Academy in Ireland. He would never
consent to put the higher education under ecclesiastical authority,
whether of Rome or Geneva.
Mr. LEATHAM boldly broke with his party, in view of the import-
ance of giving a University education to Roman Catholics which
Roman Catholics would accept. “When prejudices were the preju-
dices of a whole nation, they almost rose to the dignity of principles.
Mr. W. E. FORSTER followed suit:-
ON NAUAN
“He could not see why it was just that Roman-Catholic students should
not have quite as good a chance of getting a degree, of obtaining quite 28
much State aid in the acquisition of high University culture as Protestant
students. He entirely agreed with his hon. friend the Member for Hudders-
field that the present state of things in reality enforced religious disability."
But the Nonconformists who speak through Mr. RICHARD held
their ground. He could support no Bill that took the remnant of
the revenues of the Disestablished Church to endow the Roman-
Catholic priesthood. The Bill in effect would do this, disguise the
fact as its promoters might.
Mr. Holt (a supporter of Government) said

“They were asked to provide by that Bill for the endowment of colleges
