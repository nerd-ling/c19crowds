ship, heroic, but heart-broken in the hopeless struggle with crowned cowardice, effeminate profligacy, and Paris-pampered lust.
Methought, had the Author wanted materials for a second series, here is my LORD BEACONSFIELD busy in piling
them up for him.
'Tis true the Kings he is dethroning are black or brown, and more or less barbaric. But what capital food for the
satirist in the contact with European civilisation of CETEWAYO and SECOCENI, YAKOOB Khan and ISMAIL PASHA,—and
those who may yet be added to their number, if rope for adventures is still to be allowed the adventurous.
As I tried to set the tale of discrowned monarchs and desperate strife of Christian with Heathen to the tune of the
Christmas bells, methought I was suddenly rapt--if in the spirit of my own blue-fiery bowl I know not—to the foot of
my own Christmas-Tree !
Dazzling were the lights that sparkled among its leaves as I stood full in their splendour, presiding over the distribu.
tion of the fruit of Wit and Wisdom from its well-laden boughs.
Punch, like the POPE, appeals, " Urbi et Orbi,"—to a publio numerous and dense as the population of London, and
wide-reaching as the World !
But it was the dim, discrowned Kings I chiefly kept my eye on. They were numerous, and new ones kept coming in
every minute, thanks to our imperium in imperio, et extra imperium. Their wives, I was glad to see, had as a rule stuck to
the poor potentates in their downfall. CETEWAYO, above all, was blessed with a numerous train of Kaffir Venuses. His
prayer, when made prisoner, had not been, like AJAX's, for “more light," but for “more wives." His better-halves, or
rather twentieth-parts, for they ran to scores, had followed him to Punch's Christmas-Tree.
The light was reflected from their rounded forms as from life-size Florentine bronzes, with more dazzling effect than
could be matched in any West-End ball-room-the dresses being less in the way, and the colouring at once warmer and
more au naturel.
More chary of their charms, but not less faithful to their Lord in exile, were the harems of YAKOOB Kaan and ISMAIL
PASHA. But I am bound to say that the yashmaks of the Egyptian beauties were anything but opaque, and that in this
respect the charmers of Cabul showed themselves less civilised than the belles of Cairo.

But it was time to dismantle the tree, and appropriate its fruits.
“Precedence to Monarchs," I exclaimed, “ even dethroned ones!"
CETEwayo stepped forward first in answer to my summons.
“Assegais ?” he exclaimed, eagerly, as he put forth his hand.
"On the contrary. Spades and hoes, for the culture of mealies, instead of spears for the destruction of men."
The ex-Monarch of Zulu-land frowned as he took the peaceful gift, and turned away in deep disgust.
“And for me?” wheezed Ismail, ex-Khedive of Egypt, as he elbowed his way with scant courtesy to the front rank.
“A donkey-driver's saddle and whip—instead of the Pasha's divan-cushions and the kourbash you have made so bad a
use of. See that you treat your donkeys better than you did your Fellaheen!”
I do not understand Arabic, but I have no reason to believe, from the expression of the old fellow's face, that the
language with which he received my gift and my recommendation was in the nature of a benediction.
For Yakoob, ex-Ameer of Afghanistan, I found it difficult to choose an appropriate Christmas gift. But remembering
his reported saying that he would rather be a grass-cutter in the English camp than a ruler on the throne of Afghanistan, 1
thought I would not be far out if I presented him with a grass-cutter's knife and rope.
He took them with a sigh and a selaam, and sorrowfully shrunk back to his obscure corner, amidst the scowls of his
harem, who did not seem quite so reconciled to abdication as their Lord and Master.
“But these,” I said, “oh, ye downfallen Princes, are but the first-fruits off Punch's Christmas-Tree. He has another
and a more precious gift—rife with blessings of witty counsel and wise warning, of sweetness and light,—not to you only,
but to those who have wrought your downfall—to Princes and Peoples, to Pope and Czar, to King and Kaiser, to Chancellor

Workmen,-in a word, to ALL !"

John Laird Mair, Lord Lawrence.
BORN, MARCH 4, 1811.
DIED, JUNE 27, 1879.
Not in the far-off church, where his grey head
He bowed in worship, should that head be laid ;
His place, of right, is with our famous dead,
Who sleep within the Abbey's storied shade.
There let him sleep, where they too are at rest,
Who helped him stay our empire when it reeled-
CLYDE, POLLOCK, OUTRAM-kings of men confest,
He chief in council as these chief in field.
We saw him, grave and grey, deep-furrowed, stern,
Of visage something rugged: face and frame
Bespeaking strength; not swift, nor slow to learn ;
In choice of men of an unerring aim;
· Just, and in justice armed, nor fearing, then,
What chance or change might bring, as one that knew
The world is ruled of God and not of men,
That what's begun in right is half brought through.
In his proconsulships, from small to great,
He held his name, knowing 'twas England's too,
So high and stainless, he to love turned hate
And made of sullen foemen followers true.
Right manhood's heart he won, where'er he came,
Gentle for all his bluntness and plain ways;
Still taking Truth and Justice for his aim,
Unswayed by pride, or profit, or men's praise :
Then, when at length came trial's testing hour,
And all our Indian Empire shook and swayed,
Like a great city in an earthquake's power,
He bridled panic, and confusion stayed,
Till fluttering Fear took strength of his strong will,
And where Defiance braved Obedience bowed,
And, crippled of its power to work us ill,
Baffled Rebellion crouched before him, cowed.
While he, a wall of shelter,'tower of strength,
Stood full against the storm, and to him drew
All means of best defence, until at length,
Our armour's weakest part its’strongest grew :
For there stood LAWRENCE, with his calm, clear eye,
His iron will, wise judgment, winnowing ear,
Nor prone to trust, nor boastful to defy,
As high above all favour as all fear.
That England's Empire from that furnace came
Unshattered thanks to this man most are due;
And let not scorn be heaped upon his name,
Because small men's small fears he never knew;
When, gauging India's and her foemen's power,
From the Great Mountains to the Southern Blue,
He would not join the clamour of the hour,
Nor, to 'scape fancied risks, run danger true,
Burdens on India's poverty to lay,
That shadowy frontier shadowy foes may ward;
And, for dim fears and distant, waste away
Strength that wise rule and justice best can guard.
Lay him with the Great Dead, who, living, held
High place with the best Living ; let him sleep
After his life of toil, who heart unquelled
Unspoiled, unsoured, unspotted, still could keep.
A simple-mannered, rude and rugged man,
But true, and wise, and merciful and just.
Of all these monuments, when all we scan,
Which rises o'er more justly honoured dust?
In the Event of a Dissolution.
“ The Members of the Huddersfield Working-Men's Conservative Associa-
tion have presented Lord BEACONSFIELD with a Malacca cane, with god
handle.”
ONE prospect this Malacca cane awaits-
It may prove useful in Malacca Straits !

WHY I WENT TO KILBURN.
BECAUSE my interest in Agriculture dates
back to a very early period in my life-the
happy time when I was sent to a farm-
house in the retired village of Wisby-in-
the-Willows to be restored to convalescence
after an attack of whooping cough.
Because I wished to know something more
of Kilburn, its society, seenery, parochial
charities, and educational institutions.
Because having witnessed all kinds of
parades both at home and abroad of rank,
beauty, fashion, and millinery, 'I thought a
"parade of British and foreign cattle”
would be an agreeable change.
Because, being somewhat of a pedestrian,
it occurred to me that it would redound to
my credit to take a walk of eleven miles
of shedding. .
Because after an experience of tandems,
stage-coaches, and fours-in-hand, I jumped
at the prospect of seeing some “bee-driv-
ing.”
Because, having friends in the Island of
Cyprus, I wished to seize the opportunity
of knowing something about the cheese of
that favoured spot.
Because I thought I should like to have a
peep at the International Dairy, and the
International Dairy-Maids.
Because I was desirous to see the Imple-
ments on a fair proportion of their seven
hundred stands, either “at rest or in mo-
tion”-I was quite impartial, and without
the slightest bias either way, except that
the "Haymakers" sounded alluringly rural,
the “Steam Scarifier" moved me to a secret
shudder, and, as an old Volunteer, the
"Improved Drill” had for me an attrac-
tion that could not be gainsaid.
Because, with the prospect of a General
Election, I felt I must make the acquaint-
ance of the “Polled Breeds."
Because, being connected by family ties
with the honourable profession of the Law.
I was eager to have a glimpse of some, at
least, of the 125 Judges.
Because I felt a deep interest (this is all
owing to the mud) in the Southdowns and
the International Competition in Currant
Jelly.
Because I was led to expect that I should
behold Lord BEACONSFIELD as a Sweet Pea
-in which expectation I was disappointed,
for he turned out to be only a Chrysanthe-
mum.

more than one-third of that sum. This welcome moderation encou-
rages the hope that economy will now be the order of the day on the

THE WHOOP OF THE WHISKEY-DRINKER.
“Alcohol, purified from fusel oil, is perfectly harmless."- Professor Burrell,
of Rotterdam, as quoted by Mr. O'Sullivan, in the House of Commons, d
propos of the “Spirits in Bond” Bill.
WH0-0-OP! But that's one for Sir WILFRID'Hob!
He a worritted world of its whiskey rob?
Pooh! Calling it poison is all pure flam --
Says Professor BURRELL, of Rotterdam.
It isn't "the crathur” our peace would spoil,
'Tis that plaguy pestiferous fusel oil.
Once get rid o' that there; no harm in a dram-
Says Professor BURRELL, of Rotterdam.
Put in coffee or tea, fusel oil, says he,
Will make a man tight, nay, produce D. T.
Who-o-op! That's a smasher for teetotal sham,
From Professor BURRELL, of Rotterdam.
Keep the spirit in bond till a twelvemonth be past?
Faith, I do not mind that, so I get it at last.
But to say the pure spirit does harm is a cram!-
Says Professor BURRELL, of Rotterdam.
Who-o-op! That Dutch Professor he settles 'em quite.
And it's I am a Dutchman if he's not right.
Pure whiskey is harmless and mild as a lamb-
Says Professor BURRELL, of Rotterdam.
Who-o-op! it's all my eye. I've a “blend" from Skye,
Which is one of the primest that cash can buy ;

AIR—“My Quoen.”
WHY and when were we driven to moot it?
Was it knocked off in an afternoon?
Will the Roman-Catholic Bishops hoot it?
Have we set it afloat too late too soon?
Did we try it because we feared a flounder ?
No matter. Since still we reign supreme,
Admitting that nothing simpler, sounder,
Have we ever turned out than, “My Scheme, my Scheme!”
I will not say that it's all-sufficing,
For captious critics may find it tame;
I will not style its provisions enticing,
Nay, more, I'll grant that they're somewhat lame.
But still, when they hint we're near capsizing,
And our party "split" is the common theme,
For a bit of superior temporising,
There's nothing to touch, “My Scheme, my Scheme!”
I own that a Bill should be pleasing, plastic,
And make for the moment a decent show;
And you ask if this is at all " elastic,” -
And I answer,“ Wouldn't you like to know ?"
So with that, and the hint “Catch a weasel sleeping !"
Whatever may be your Party dream,
Be sure that Office is still worth the keeping,
Though it cost us such shifts as, “My Scheme, my Scheme!”

agrees.
This brought up Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, who referred to
Lord HARTINGTON as “the late Leader of the Liberal
Party”-on which Mr. Fawcett sharply lectured Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN, and Sir CHARLES DILKE stoutly defended
him. Ultimately, a Motion to report progress was nega-
tived by 250 to 36, which probably measures very fairly
the strength of Mr. CHAMBERLAIN's Intransigente fol-
lowing with the Irish Obstructive element thrown in.
Altogether, Punch wishes he could draw a curtain
over the night's records. Even if the banishment of the
Cat from the Army and Navy be a consummation devoutly
to be wished, in the interests of humanity, as many
Liberals think, for the credit and popularity of the
Services, it is impossible to imagine a good end forwarded
in a more objectionable way, or one likelier to redound to
the damage of the Liberal Party,
If the tactics of the Irish Obstructives are to be
tolerated, still more imitated, legislation will become
impossible, and all respect for Parliament out-of-doors
must come to an end. Whatever may be said against the
offhandedness and flippancy of a few Jacks in Office, the
behaviour of Messrs. CALLAN, PARNELL, O'DONNELL, and
O'CONNOR POWER, is such as no self-respecting legisla-
tive assembly can tolerate. If the House can't check it,

Account of a terrific ascent of the celebrated Ritupatopza
Cone, and of all the highest points of the hitherto
inaccessible Hiarandhia Mountains, in a Letter to
the Editor, bearing date two weeks ago.*
SIR, -When you appointed me your Climbing Corre-

**Excelsior" is my motto, and “Excelserwaterior"

This, you may think, is levity, but I am a light climber,
as I am a light sleeper-in fact I have a horror of any
man who is a dark sleeper. Mind, it's a dark "sleeper
that upsets the train—and that will upset my train of
thought, if I allow myself to dwell any more on this
fascinating but abstruse subject.
You, Sir, wanted me to do the Matterhorn.
"The Matterhorn be blowed!" I replied, gaily, and
then went on to show that the Matterhorn had been
blown long ago by somebody who only wanted to trumpet
his own fame to the world. But your object, Sir, was
simply to sound me. In return, I gave no uncertain
note.f I made an advance-a friend in your interests
made another-and away I went.
I will not descant on the terrible moment of parting.
I had to tear myself away from the partner of my bosom,
to bid her leave the weekly bills till my return, which Í
pretended “would be in about ten minutes, as I was only
going to call on my solicitor," and then locking the door on
her and descending the stairs, five steps at once, alpen-

my umbrella suddenly, and so avoid either a flower-pot,
or a waterjug, or a slop-basin- I had not the heart to

then the scene itself is just one of those
touches of nature that go straight to the
heart of an audience. Success here is
rather due to the situation than to the
Actor. The child is absolutely natural !
This is the highest praise.
But his great Scene-Coupeau's death
from delirium tremens-was too protracted.
In Paris it was not one whít shorter ;
longer, perhaps; but one was so horrified
by it, that one wished it over, so that
the wretched man's sufferings might the
sooner be ended. But here I wished it
over, because the Actor's energy seemed
to be spent, and one felt that it was with

ment to the end, and that it was abso-

divert the audience's attention from the
father to the child, so that it might be
brought back again to the father, a second

At the Ambigu I breathed freely when
the Act was over, for Coupeau's sake, not
for GIL-NAZA's; but here I was glad when
the curtain terminated, not Coupeau's, but
Mr. WARNER'S sufferings.
His make-up was-thank Heaven !-less
repulsive than GIL NAZA's, and, without
comparison, and putting aside that this is
imitation and not original creation, Mr.
WARNER's acting in this scene is decidedly
powerful. In the French piece there was

Or the skies have withheld the due drops,
And the farmers all round are complaining,

Or for wet-whiche'er needful may be.

(Lords, Monday, July 14.)
HY should Lord STRATHEDEN be so much concerned
about Russian evacuation that he is determined to
make a motion if the Russians wont? His eagerness
to sustain the Government was ill-rewarded by Lord
SALISBURY, who plainly said the Government wanted
none of his sustaining. Lord STRATHEDEN shut up,
stung but not squenched, his motto being "Mersus
emergam”_"the more I am sat upon the more I
will not be put down.”
Has Government been coquetting with the Irish
Roman Catholics in the matter of University Educa-
tion Lord EMLY asserts as much, distinctly refer-
ring to a proposal for settlement negotiated some time
ago with the Irish Executive, in favour of which, he says, a petition was forwarded to the Prime Minister signed by almost every Catholic
of position and importance in Ireland, with a result of expectations only raised to be dashed by a measure as unjust as it would prove
abortive.
Called to his legs by Lord GRANVILLE, Lord BEACONSFIELD declared that he had listened to “the extraordinary speech of the noble Baron
with amazement,” that “nothing of the romance in which he appeared to be indulging " was known to Lord B.; that the Cabinet
knew nothing of this negotiation of these schemes and plans; that no proposition on the subject ever came to Lord B., directly or indi-
rectly; that he knew nothing of any authority for Lord EMLY's statement; that he entirely repudiated it, and was sure his colleagues
would do the same.
Lord Esly explained that he had spoken not of Her Majesty's Government, but of the Irish Government, and that he had himself
seen the proposition to which he had referred.
It is clear either that the Irish Government keeps Lord B. in the dark, or Lord B. the Irish Government. Let our readers explain it
which way they will, it is wonderful that St. George's Channel should set such a gulf between the Irish and English segments of an
Administration.
... The LORD CHANCELLOR tried to explain the difference between what Government had done last year in the Intermediate Educational
Bill and what they declined to do now.
A distinction without a difference, says Lord SELBOURNE; and so says Punch.
(Commons.)- After some hours' desultory talk, the CHANCELLOR, rising to ask for priority of Government orders on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays, took occasion to announce the “Happy Despatch" list of Bills which it was proposed to put out of their misery. Of
those already on their way but one remains-“The Remnant of an Army”--th: Army Discipline Bill. (See its embodiment in Punch's

POWER gravely rebuked the House for its
grievous waste of time and its general
misconduct of business. Punch congratulates
them on their command of countenance.
Sir R. PEEL indulged in a lengthy and
lively disquisition on the misconduct of
the Zulu War, the shortcomings of Lord
CHELMSFORD, the unfair treatment of Co-
lonel WEATHERLY and Captain CAREY, and
a number of incidental topics, for which
divagations he got rapped over the knuckles
by Colonel STANLEY and Lord HARTINGTON,
who took occasion to preach the House a
neat little sermon on the duty of not at-
tempting more business than it could grasp,
and doing that a little better. They must
have a night for the Zulu War, and another,
with Sir CHARLES DILKE, for the Berlin
Treaty, à propos of Greece.
At last the House got into the postponed
clauses of the Army Discipline Bill, and
stayed there muddling the rest of the night.

the humane feeling that prompts these
Lords, the better pleased he is that their
horror of suffering is not to be allowed
to stand in the way of its alleviation. This
is the ground and justification of experi-

due regulation and control.
Earl BEAUCHAMP, Lord CARNARVON, and
the Bishop of PETERBOROUGH, whom Punch
congratulates on his courage as much as his
clear-headedness, urged the sensible, and
unsensational, side of the argument—that
the lower animals may reasonably and re-
ligiously be made to suffer for the allevia-
tion of greater suffering among the higher
animals, provided always that such suf-
fering is inflicted under due safeguards
and not wantonly, nor in excess of the true
requirements and objects of science.

tor's perquisites, his visitors are not paying

“with an order.” (This will save some

Queen of Scots, or any of the young Ladies
of the establishment coming out after the
Show is over; and any three-cornered
billet-doux, whether accompanied by a
bouquet or a bracelet, will be immediately
returned.
BALLOONS.-Anyone wishing to have a
balloon during his stay in London, can do
so. Apply to the Secretary of the Windham
Club, Ayr Street. The charges are two-
and-sixpence for the first hour-shilling
extra to the man, if taken-and sixpence for
every quarter of an hour afterwards, a de-
posit being paid in advance. The charge for
one ascent is usually five shillings, depend-
ing a great deal on where you want to go.
There is no third class. The descent is ten
shillings more. A traveller by this species
of conveyance is not compelled, any more
than by cab or train regulations, to return
by the same conveyance, as, when he arrives
at his destination, he may, if he pleases, get
out and walk. A favourite excursion, in
fine weather, is to the Milky Way, where
London visitors can refresh themselves with
milk fresh from the cow, and after inspect-
ing the celebrated bull,"Taurus," as well
known as PAUL POTTER's, they can take a
turn in the dockyard to see the Ram, and
thence, by ticket, to the Zodiacal Gardens.
Hire a good horoscope from one of the
attendants, and notice the architecture of
the new Châteaux en Espagne, nd the Old
Castles in the Air. If you take our advice,
you will let your balloon wait for you, and
return as you came. It saves trouble, and
thus you will have spent a happy, profitable,
and a not uninstructive day.

CRANBROOK TO HIS COUNTRYMEN.
THEY tell me the Liberal Party
To turn out the Tories will seek;
That the Rads mean to rally round HARTY,
And oust us. I like their cool cheek!
But I trust that in manner explicit
You 'll tell the low cads it's no go.
When your smiles and your votes they solicit,
My Countrymen, promptly say, “No!”
Poor HARTY can sway them no longer;
By sub-gangway shouters he's led;
The tail one can see is the stronger,
And soon will be waggling the head.
We hold it in check for the present,
But once we are forced to let go,
The results will be deuced unpleasant.
So, my Countrymen, stoutly say "No!”
Shun the Rads and their arts of seduction !
Just give them a hand on the helm,
They will steer the State-ship to destruction,
And rapidly ruin the realm.
Shall they tempt you to turn out us Tories ?
Undo our best work at a blow?
Shall they tarnish our newly-gilt glories ?
My Countrymen, sternly say “No!"
Trust them not! When they'd lead you to ruin,
And snub the long-suffering Turk,
When they'd bow to that base Northern Bruin,
And duties imperial shirk.
Bid you cripple the Army and Navy-
And then, just to keep taxes low,
Make John BULL to his foes cry « peccavi”-
My Countrymen, bravely say "No!”
Will you change the land-laws of the nation,
And lay wicked hands on the Church -
Though they hide it with round-aboutation,
That purpose you 'll spy if you search.
Will you see our dear Mother abolished ?
The last feudal barriers laid low;
All the true Tory strongholds demolished ?
My Countrymen, firmly say "No!”

Nor listen when Radicals rave!

In Supply, a Donnybrook Fair fight over the Irish Constabulary

But the ruction, though long, was not lively. Indeed, it was only
redeemed from dulness by a batch of Irish reminiscences from the
Major. Talking of Ireland, he said, reminded him of South
Africa :-
“There were people sent out there to convert the natives. (An Hon.
Member-Missionaries.) Yes, the missionaries. (Laughter.) They were
out to convert those people, who had a very decent religion of their own
if they were left to themselves. (Laughter.) These persons went to South
Africa for no other purpose to his certain knowledge than to plunder.
(Laughter.) One of them rushed into his Colonel's tent one day, and said,
Sir, I want a commando.' 'What is a commando?' said the Colonel.
'A force of men.' For what purpose ?' asked the Colonel. To punish a
chief.' For what reason-a flag of truce is flying?' 'Oh!' said the
Missionary, 'a chief has stolen my horse.' 'Indeed!' said the Colonel.
'I shan't give you a commando ; but I will make full inquiries.' He made
full inquiries, and found the Missionary had stolen the chief's horse, and the
chief had only got it back. That was precisely the case in Ireland. (Renewed
laughter.)"
Thank you, Major-very much thank you.

Sir W. FRASER asked how if they wouldn't come?
Sir STAFFORD said it would be better to wait and see if they came

Mr. WHITBREAD thought it was a pity GRISSELL and WARD had
not been prosecuted in an ordinary court of law for trying to obtain

Sir STAFFORD said there might be something in that, but still
Privilege was Privilege, and a pretty Parliamentary plaything which
Parliament ought not to let out of its own hands.
Then Parliament proceeded to another branch of its Privileges-to
talk out one of the three miserable survivors of the Session, the
Banking Bill.
A great unlimited Scotch Joint-Stock Bank having failed, and all
but dragged Scotland into ruin, a cry was raised for statutory limita-
tion of liability. The CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER thereupon
introduced a Bill which nobody quite liked, seeing that instead of
providing a cheap and easy machinery to enable unlimited banks to be-
come limited, with the consent of shareholders, it mixed itself up with
difficult and disputed questions between English, Scotch, and Irish
bankers. Now, Sir STAFFORD is fain to drop the clause relating

A PUNCH AND BULL FIGHT.
In a column of local intelligence, and a police report, you will find
these words :-
“Punch took out a cross-summons against BULL for assault, and this was
also dismissed, the Mayor remarking that there appeared to have been a
quarrel between them, and they fought it out.”
There are, possibly, news-readers-north of the Tweed, in par-
ticular-who, should the foregoing statement perchance have met
their eyes, may have misunderstood it. For their information it
may be needful to explain that the PUNCH above mentioned is a
Mr. ALBERT PUNCH, a gentleman residing at Newport, in the Isle of
Wight, and the BULL between whom and Punch there appeared to
the Mayor (of that borough) to have been a quarrel, a Mr. MAURICE
BULL, Mr. ALBERT PUNCH's neighbour. Some words having taken
place between them, and each having declared himself as good a
man as the other, a bout of fisticuffs occurred, and they fought for
ten minutes, “complainant," Mr. BULL,“ believing," as he said,
“that he himself struck the first blow." Let nobody, therefore,
imagine, or pretend to say, that anything has happened so unnatural,
monstrous, prodigious, portentous, ridiculous, and absurd as a
quarrel and a fight between Punch and JOHN BULL.
There's BIGGAR past a joke,

for Buns). If you can't afford a penny for
a whole bun, only eat half, for which, ac-
cording to all arithmetical rules, you will
only have to pay a halfpenny. They can't
force you to eat the other half of the bun,

compel you to pay for what you haven't had.

This is the most verdant spot in the Metro-

any waterman on a cab-rank about “Bays-

picturesque buildings of the Metropolis,
situated in King William Street, so called

style, wishing to conciliate the conquered
race, “let who will have their stake in the

The windows are all wils de bauf: the

Short-hornamental Gothic. Its doors are
all fastened with bul-locks; and the ancient
song of the Club is-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
that an excess of mathematical training was already
exacted from pupil-teachers.
Dr. LYON PLAYFAIR endeavoured to explain that the
natural phenomena which Sir JOHN LUBBOCK wished
children to be taught did not mean mathematios, but
only such matters as “the nature of the air they
breathed, the water they drank, and the food they ate."
However, Sir John's motion was negatived by the Col-
lective Wisdom.
Then followed conversation of small consequence on a
complaint, made by Mr. W. E. JENKINS, that the cost of
the Natural History Museum, South Kensington, con-
siderably exceeded the original estimate. When were
originally estimated expenses ever not exceeded by those
incurred?
More conversation, equally momentous, on the re-
trenchment recently practised by the Society of Scotland
for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge, in cut-
ting down its Schools. Then at last the House got
into Committee of Supply, and heard Lord GEORGE
HAMILTON'S annual statement on the Education Vote.
He took credit "for the gratifying and continuous pro-
gress in the education given in the Elementary Schools
of England and Wales," as indicated in the Depart-
ment's report for the past year. The School accommo-
dation now provided was nearly up to 4,000,000 places;
the children on the books were 3,500,000; those in
average attendance 2,400,000. The per-centage of passes
in all subjects, and the number of pupils examined was
“considerable and gratifying."
Unfortunately, the cost of the schooling whose progress
is so gratifying is also considerable, and continuously
increasing.
These unqualifying facts were too apparent from the
financial details given by the Noble Lord. The estimate
of the coming year, framed in expectation of a further
increase of attendances, amounted in all to $2,481,168,
being £334,804 more than the grant of the previous
year. As it is, the excess of accommodation over at-
tendances leaves 1,300,000 vacant places. Certainly,
we have "ample accommodation for the present;"
accommodation somewhat more than commodious for
those who pay for it. If the money went more of it
in schooling, and less in schools, would there not be some-

(Monody by a much-fagged Member.)
“The speeches at the Ministerial dinner at the Mansion
House are the dying swan-song of the Session.”—Times,
THE Session dies ! Swan-like ? Oh, Jupiter,
Remembering sadly how St. Stephen's carries on,
Methinks you err;
Small aptness is there in the strained comparison.
The points of the analogy to trace,
Pray what of music, dignity, or grace
Accompanies the parting Session's exit ?
We'd let the poor thing pass, we would not vex it
With memories. But music? One might take
The charivari at an Irish wake
As a more fit similitude. How truly
'Twould type the Celtic shindyings, rude, unruly,
That long have plagued the public tympanum !
Swan-song? 'Tis all a hum !
You joke with us, great Jupiter, and smile
In grim Saturnian style.
Post-prandially let Ministers rejoice,
To lend the dying Session dulcet voice;
Our aching ears have memory, and know better.
Though WHETHAM, after many a liberal wetter,
Expand in glowing glory,
And shout his tintamarre to all that's Tory ;-)
Though SMITH and BURY our twin forces butter,
While yinous cheers greet every vaunt they utter;
Though Beaming BENJAMIN
Vent bland beatitudes about Berlin,
And scientific frontiers bought, not paid for,
Or shape a pleasing puzzle, plainly made for
The Sphinx's latest, than its earliest tougher,
And fog with phrases each bucolic buffer;-
Let SALISBURY and NORTHCOTE bandy banter,
In imitation of the Arch-Enchanter,
And cits shout praise till all appears (True) Blue,
It will not do!
“ Capital Muniments” comfort not us,
And as for BEN's new-fangled Cerberus,
The triune peasant,
Evolved, like the proverbial German's camel,
From an imagination facts ne'er trammel, -
Political economy made pleasant
By comic quips and cranks,
May charm the Tory ranks,
Accustomed to be fed on paradox
As nubibustic as the realms of Nox;
But you'll as soon check earthquakes with a fiddle
As settle the Land-Question with a riddle !
The Session 's moribund; all men rejoice,
But for its parting voice,
To call it "swan-like” were a mere abuse
Of Art rhetoric
Or diction metaphoric.
No, Jupiter, mere mortals it must strike
As much more like
The dreary, dying cackle of a goose !

Hence, at Port-
aux-Ânes on the
first day of April,
1979, there was nothing left but the Policeman. At first he had not liked this.
He had said to himself, “No thieves, no business. There will be nothing to
catch-not even the Magistrate's eye!” Then he skipped about on his beat,
and tried to catch himself tripping. After this he sang a catch. But he still
felt out in the cold. This was something. It enabled him to catch one.
The villagers said, “The empty charge-sheet has done it. It has proved a
wet blanket.”
This reminded him of the bed of the river.
No one had ever yet communicated to him anything to his advantage. He
determined to stand on the bank, and drop it a line. It seemed to him the way
to catch something.
He said, “I am now on my own hook, and can enjoy my leisure.” He was
right. It was his bank holiday.
But a picture of recreation may sometimes be too highly coloured. Even the,
account of a bank holiday may be overdrawn. Such was the case with this one
Then it came to a close. How? By a sudden check.
This very extraordinary thing had happened.
Five hundred thousand strangers, fully armed, equipped, and provided
with powerful field and siege artillery, arrived at the little village of Pont-aux-
Ânes, and asked for dinner.
When five hundred thousand strangers, fully armed, equipped, and pro-
vided with powerful field and siege artillery, ask for dinner, they sometimes
forget to pay for it.
These five hundred thousand strangers forgot to pay for it.
Then some one uttered this tremendous word, “Police!”
And now these two were facing each other. Might meeting right. A Field-
Marshal meeting a Policeman. The ridiculous opposite the sublime. A
frightful antagonism. Then they talked through an interpreter.

mark the spot where some dreadful deed
was committed.

Not liking to hurt his feelings, I say,
“Yes, I see it.” Then I add, presently,
“I saw it this morning.”
“Ah!” he says, not a bit chagrined or

“Yes, he did.”

I have got a little surprise for you, that I
think will please you. We won't let the

The dear old Squire! So profuse in his
hospitality, so luxurious in his arrange-

occurred to any other man. But, certainly,
it was very pleasant. As we got to the
barge, we saw the men at the air-pumps,

Squire, HAROLD, LOTTIE, myself, and the

We could not speak much in the diving-

afternoon, however, we had some excite-
ment. LOTTIE had gone home, and we had
visited every likely spot in search of the
birds, but, evidently, the weather was too
bad for even partridges to be out in.
“Come, my lads," said the Squire, turn-

a punt. “We ought to be near the river.

In a moment, half a dozen boys and men
were diving in the water. Suddenly the tail

(Compiled for the use of Males by a Distinguished
Female Member of the British Association.)
Q. What is your position as a man?
A. I am a unit in a minority.
Q. As women belong to the majority, what is your
duty to them?
Å. To submit myself entirely to their guidance.
Q. Have you any rights ?
A. Certainly. I have the right to know how to make
a pudding, to darn a stocking, and to scrub a floor.
Q. Are you the head of your own household ?
A. Yes, theoretically.
Q. What privilege does this theoretical “headship”
confer upon you ?
A. It gives me the privilege of settling all the bills
and earning the money with which those bills are paid.
Q. Ought you to be given a vote?
A. That is a matter that should be referred to my
wife for decision.
Q. In what way has your education been neglected ?
A. I have wasted my time in learning grammar when
it ought to have been employed in mastering the prin-
ciples of ironing, clothes-washing, and bonnet-trimming.
*Q. Of whom should the Members of the House of
Commons consist ?
A. Of maiden Ladies who admit that they will never

SAINT PARTRIDGE AND SAINT SWITHIN.
THE celebration of the Feast of St. Partridge, which
fell due on the 1st instant, had this year to be gene-
rally, if not universally, postponed owing to the lateness
of the harvest yet to come, if, indeed, the weather will
allow of any. This unseasonable and uncanonical put-
off has been necessitated by the continual rain, of which
the downpour, now of so long duration, is popularly
ascribed to the animosity of St. Swithin. But is that
imputation sustainable ? Can it be possible that St.
Swithin owes St. Partridge a grudge, which he is paying
him off, being actuated towards him with such spite and
ill-will' as to be capable of causing the postponement of
his Festival by deferring his day, apparently sine die?
Is that the way in which one Saint can be imagined
behaving to another? Can sweet St. Partridge be con-
ceived to have soured St. Swithin, offended him, made
him angry? Do Saints in the present circumstances and
situation of St. Swithin still remain subject to vindic-
tive and violent wrath? Tantæne animis cælestibus
ire ? No, no. The Saint who could demean himself
to the petty malice of hindering the observance of his
fellow Saint's anniversary, would be altogether unworthy
of the name he is invoked by, and the nimbus he wears.
"VIVISECTION!"
At the same time it may perhaps truly be said that St.
Swithin, for our sins perhaps, has been giving us too

thing can be exchanged for coals. Some years ago “the Coal Hole"
was a Cave of Harmony in the Strand, like the Cider Cellars in
Maiden Lane. Information on the subject can be obtained at the
Coal Exchange from the damsel at the bar, whose attachment to a
handsome coal-heaver has been celebrated in the well-known song,
which she herself used to sing with much taste and pathos :-
Heaver ! of thee I'm sadly thinking!
Thy gentle voice my spirits shall cheer.
Thine was the eye at me always winking
Over the pint pot containing the beer.
It is well worth visiting the Coal Exchange merely to hear this
beautiful ballad.
THE_COCOA TREE.-In St. James's Street. Well worth a
visit. Entrance free as far as the Hall Porter's desk. Be always
polite to this official, remembering that any one who is “Hall
Porter" can't be a half-and-half sort of a chap. When there,
apply to him, and, for a small fee, he will give you a full and inte-
resting account of the milk in the Cocoa-nut, though as yet modern
science has not been able to explain the raison d'être of the hair out-
side. Here all games are played for Cocoa-nuts, and the Members
travel about to the various races with a large supply of this nutri-
tious fruit, as prizes for successful competitors at Aunt Sally and
the sticks.' The Cocoa Tree Club is a most thriving establishment.

To beat dripping covers is scarce worth the trouble.”
Aha! The wind's ill that blows nobody good.
True the wet has proved fatal to many a brood,
Parent birds have made moan over eggs swamped and addled,
When our covers were lakes in which ducks might have paddled,
But partridges drowned when they'd scarce chipped the shell,
Yet, - yes, on the whole, 'tis perhaps just as well.
Water! Better than fire ; and a cold in the head
Is not quite so bad as a dose of cold lead.

They may bag a few birds on the skirts of the wheat,
But I don't think this cover will pay 'em to beat.

No! Farmers and Sportsmen may grumble together-
For my part, I rather approve of the weather.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

WORDS WITHOUT SONGS.
MY DEAR MR. PUNCH,
I HAVE been very much struck by a correspond-
ence that has recently appeared in the columns of one
of your contemporaries about the scarcity of good English
songs. I do not think that the matter has received fair
treatment. It has been assumed by some of the writers
that we have no good composers, when, as a matter of
fact, the poets and not the musicians are in fault. Some
one has said (or if he has not said it, he ought to say it
immediately), “Let me make the words of a nation's
songs, and anyone else may compose the music." If we
| had better poetry, we should have better ballads. Under
these circumstances, I have no hesitation in rushing
myself to the assistance of our song-makers. They want
novelty, and I think I can supply the article in great
profusion.
As an earnest of my powers, I give a few specimens.
The first I select is quite a new idea. Why should we
not have songs about village pumps, new brass door-
knockers, or old street-lamps ? In the following I have
taken as a theme a well-known article in constant
domestic use. I have called it,
THE SOUND SIGNAL.
The Babe is startled on the nursery floor;
The Schoolboy pauses in his game;
The Lover lingers at his darling's door,
And half forgets to breathe her name.
The six weeks' Bride with blushing pleasure leads ;
The Justice follows with his dame.
With hurried steps march Men of Thoughts and Deeds.
The Grandsire strives to march the same.
“Come the short and the long to the boom of my dong,"
Are the words to the song of the loud Dinner-Gong.
Then again, why should not foreign fairy tales suggest
occasionally an idea ? The story of the Little Tin Soldier
has often appeared to me to contain the germ of a notion.
I have knocked off a quaint little something (of which
below I give the first verse), which I frankly admit is
founded upon this fable. I call it
" THE FLESH-POTS.”
THE IMPECUNIOUS WARRIOR.

“My belle I feign would be ringing."
“My beau must list while I'm singing."
Mrs. Brown.“ ERRON'ous, SIR, THEIR DOCTRINES MAY BE ; BUT THEIR CAKE,

HAH! “One man in his time plays many parts,"
So saith the English SHAKSPEARE, doth he not ?
Meaning-no matter! Preachers stretch their text
Ofttimes beyond its first significance,
For special application,-why not I?
I have played many parts, nor played them ill,
Though mostly minor ones, alas! But now,
What if poor Plon-Plon, much derided “Pro.”,
Mere General Utility Man, sometimes
Esteemed the veriest Super, should at last,
Though late yet not too late, possess a chance ?
Aha! It likes me well, right well, i' faith.
Methinks that I could star it with the best,
Would they but let me. B-r-r-r! I bear a chest,
And boast a calf! Yon swaggerer on the wall
Had port and front no better than mine own.
So bravely mounted, booted, spurred, and draped,
With rampant charger, and with flying cloak,
He shows pure demi-gód. Set him afoot
Beside me, and I'd match him brow for brow,
Fine chiselled lip for lip, forelock for forelock.
The Ladies swear I'm like him, line for line.
And why not act for act, triumph for triumph ?
'Tis the dress does it. I could play his part,
Called to the front, caparisoned aright,
Welcomed by a full house. Ah! shall it be?
His part indeed 's a little out of fashion,
Less popular, perchance, than when he played it :
Damned by its last performer, who at length
Was hissed from off the Stage, a dénoúment
He might have 'scaped had he not scorned my hints.
The piece is old, the rôle is not the rage,
But there have been revivals that eclipsed
The original performance. Is't so sure
The present play will run much longer ? Ah!
A change were now my chance! Where could they look
For one to fill his part, save here? 'Tis true
I have pooh-poohed it times and oft, have sworn
The Stage were well if once well swept of it.
But what said shrewd NAVARRE, gay huckster-hero ?
“Paris is worth a mass !” And, after all,
The part, as I should play it, would appear
A new creation, and entrance the house
From gods to groundlings. All the TALMA swells
Within this breast! I'd pose as Hercules !
God Mars himself ! though that might rouse rude mirth
Amidst mine enemies. I must dissemble

And now we are ready for the Masonic Chaplain.
He raises his hand and delivers a Masonic Prayer, in which there
are a few sly hits at BURNS's private life, with an apology for
his weaknesses, which, considering the occasion, strikes me as coming
a little late, and being rather more than usually out of place.
However, only about twenty people, of whom I happen to be one,

Under thy guiding hand,

They are making up their sets. Our hostess
is, as it were, casting the parts for three
comediettas of four dramatis persone each.
Becoming wary by experience, and aspiring
to improve, I prefer playing in company with
my fellow-men. As, out of politeness to the
fair guests (of various ages), I cannot utter this
sentiment aloud, I adopt much the same plan
of tactics as one does in a ball-room when the
smiling hostess attempts to surprise you into
dancing with some neglected faded fair one,
for whom she has charitably undertaken to
find partners.
The formula then is, “ Thank you so much,
but I've been dancing everything, and 1
really must,” &c.; or, plainly and defiantly,
“Thanks, but I'm engaged — just waiting
for my partner to return; ” or, “Thanks,
but I don't dance a galop, or a waltz,” ác.,
or any other excuse ready at the moment.
Or one retires into a remote corner of a con-
servatory, followed by the hostess with her
protégée, or down to the refreshment-room,
or, in fact, “anywhere, everywhere, out of
the world !"
I see a gallant set (male) in flannels and
colours. I should like to make one of their
party. They were enthusiastic till I came np
diffidently. The hostess suggests my joining
them. They pretend to be in doubt as to
whether MACLAREN isn't coming. The hostess
says I can play till he comes. There is no
avidity on the part of the flannels and colours
to close with this proposition.
It suddenly occurs to me that I am in the
position of the “Neglected Faded Flower" for
whom the hostess is so charitably anxious to
obtain a partner. I say, apologetically, “ Per-
haps you've made up your set?”. They reply,
awkwardly, “that they have, but- Then

DRESS.- Reversible suits are the best-morning dress

“Yes!” I exclaim, exultingly—" on Barnes Bridge,
and Barnes, too, and the Pool !"
And I nearly shout with joy at remembering so much.
The little Etonian only shakes his head pityingly. All
gone-except the bridge.
I question him about the position of certain houses.
No. He doesn't know them. He has never even heard
of them. “JOE's?! Pooh! Who's JOE?“BRIAN?

that were he to put his thoughts into words, he would
say, “Poor old chap! What is he maundering about ?”
I am inclined to ask if Eton exists at all, as I knew it?
My host tires of the conversation-perhaps of me. I
remark to him, for the sake of my character for vera-
city, “The place must have changed considerably."
He nods.
The boy, cutting at the hundredth invisible ball with
a racket, and smiling, knowingly, up at me, from under
his broad brim, observes,
“I s'pose you haven't been there for a very long time?"
It occurs to me, as something that had never struck
me before, that I have not been there for a very long time.
I begin to call to mind when I left, and when I went, -
dates for the boy's information, and my own.
My host suggests that TEDDY, the Etonian, should play
a game of lawn-tennis with me; whereat the boy seems
to measure me from head to foot (not a very lengthy
calculation-though I would not hear my enemy say so),
and his smile becomes more supercilious and more
decided than ever.
“Do you play lawn-tennis at Eton ?" I ask diffi-
dently, and am almost inclined to add “Sir,” and raise
my hat to him, respectfully.
"A little--not much,” he answers, carelessly, switching
the racket about.
“I suppose," I say to him, still diffidently, and with
a trembling sort of fear that he will, by some sort of
right, fag me to fetch the balls, or order me to run and
get something for him that he has left in the house, “I
suppose you are a great swell at tennis ?”
I put this to him in a flattering tone, so as to conciliate
him, and induce him not to be severe, or unkind, with
me.
“No," he says, “not much of a swell," and he begins

And mimes and wears the modish mask,

Blind spite's poor substitute for wit.

grinders, nor mechanical piano-players. There
is no intensely Provincial Company acting in a
stuffy little theatre. As there is no temple of
the Drama of any sort, fourth-rate “London
Stars” never fill engagements “ for six nights
only.” There are no adulterating grocers,
dishonest butchers, nor poisoning wine-mer-
chants. The company is the selectest in the
world. There are no vulgar matrons, fast young
ladies, nor unpleasant old maids. Rain is un-
known, and the climate is unique.
There, Mr. Punch, surely such a description
should make your mouth water! And you
want the direction ? Well, I have no objec-
tion to giving it you. The only stipulation I
would make is, that you do not send too many
people. All you have to do is to take a balloon,
and go to-the North Pole !
And now, as we live in a sceptical age, let
me furnish you with a proof that I have kept
my annual engagement. “Seeing is believ-
ing;” but as I am not particularly fond of
company, I do not very often afford an “ocular
demonstration" of my presence. But this will
suffice. I quote from the Times of Sept. 24th :
"Captain J. F. Cox, master of the British ship
Privateer, which arrived at Delaware Breakwater on
the 9th inst. from London, says:- On the 5th ult..
100 miles west of Brest (France), weather fine and
clear, at 5 P.M., as I was walking the quarter-deck,
looking to windward, I saw something black rise out
of the water about 20 feet, in shape like an immense
snake, about three feet in diameter. It was about
300 yards from the ship, coming towards us. It
turned its head partly from us, and went down with
a great splash, after staying up about five seconds,
but rose again three times, at intervals of ten seconds,
until it had turned completely from us, and was going
from us with great speed, and making the water boil
all round it. I could see its eyes and shape perfectly.
It was like a great eel or enake, but as black as coal
tar, and appeared to be making great exertions to get
away from the ship. I have seen many kinds of fish
in five different oceans, but was never favoured with
a sight of the great sea snake before.'"
And, having sent you this, allow me to sign

A CALL FOR A CANDIDATE.
In the account, according to the
Morning Post, of the recent Trades'
Union Conference at Exeter Hall,
and in the paragraph comprising a
speech reported to have been de-
livered by a Mr. Z. D. BERRY, you
will find the following words :-
“He_trusted people would vote for
Whig, Tory, Radical, or the Devil him-
self, so long as they would pledge them-
selves to put down Crown trading."
It is hardly conceivable that Mr.

speak for any considerable number
of tradesmen besides himself. Other

THE EYES OF THE FOREIGNER.
“The eyes of the foreigner are once more fixed on us."-Daily Telegraph.
OH, say not Old England is on the decline,
A mere Pouvoir fini as good as played out!
Her star of ascendancy brightly doth shine,
__Brave BENJAMIN's boldness hath brought it about.,
The meteor flag once again is unfurled,
The long drowsing lion doth ramp and doth roar,
To the awe and alarm of a wondering world,
And the Foreigner's eyes are fixed on us once more!
The studious calm that an Elcro disdains,
The steady reserve that a SALISBURY scorns,
Are gone; we've the loveliest tossing of manes,
And beating of tocsins, and blowing of horns.
BRITANNIA 's en évidence, armed to the eyes,
Proud, prompt, and prepared to pay off every score.
Midst Imperial posings and patriot cries,
The Foreigner's eyes are fixed on us once more!
The Foreigner's eyes? Well, and what do they see?
And what is the sort of expression they wear?
Do they see us magnanimous, prosperous, free ?
Look with fixed admiration, or jealousy's glare ?
No matter; there's tribute enough in their gaze,
They may hate or despise, but they cannot ignore;
For we make such a blaze, such a shindy we raise,
That the Foreigner's eyes are fixed on us once more !
True, our taxes run high, and our tradings run low,
Our workshops are empty, our hands over full;
True, Freedom's face flushes no more with the glow

But what are dishonour, loss, failure, fatigue,

GOBEMOUCHERIES : ALL ABOUT A VISIT TO VIENNA.
What England says.-Setting aside conjecture, as certainly vain
and probably misleading, we may accept without reserve the state-
ment that the result of the conferences between the two statesmen
of the day has been to establish the conclusion that the interests of
Austria and Germany, in regard to pending European questions, have
been found to be in the main identical.
What France says.-The meeting is a menace to the peace of
Europe. France has an enemy the more !-one that must be crushed !
What Russia says. It is a farce, but a dangerous one! It
teaches a lesson—that Siberia is not yet sufficiently populated ! This
newly-discovered plot of the Nihilists must supply a new batch of
labourers to the quicksilver mines !
What Turkey says.-It is to be hoped that the outcome of this
very interesting meeting may be a new loan to the Sublime Porte!
What Italy says.-Surely so intelligent a statesman as BISMARCK
must have explained that Trieste can no longer exist as an Austrian
sea-port. Italy has claims which must be settled as a supplement
to the Treaty of Berlin!
What Greece says.-Of course these two statesmen had no subject
of discussion so pressing as the rectification of the Greek-Turkish
frontier! When honest men agree ...!

Ratepayers' Reflections- Various.
THOUGH I read the whole of Sir CHARLES

make head or tail of the true merits of the
School-Board question ?
Am I really very very deeply interested
in the Education of the Country ?
Would I, but for the threat of a sum-
mons, further its development by quietly
paying one-and-twopence in the pound?
Would I ever pay so much as the two-
pence even without the shilling ?
Would I, in fact, if I could help it, pay
anything at all ?
Am I really and truly horrified when told
that, unless I do, 400,391 children will
arrive at maturity, without ever making
the acquaintance of the “Three R.'s?”
Do not I think that the "Three R.'s"
may be supplemented by the "Three D.'s,"

THE JESTER'S JUDGMENT.
Therefore, of the two sorts of bores, I give the palm to you.
To Punch's open judgment-seat two queer appellants came,
The man who'd willingly debase Ideals that should rule,
One grave and of a sombre look, and STULTUS was his name; May dub himself a Jester, but he is a graceless fool.
The other, call him FATUUS, was of a gayer guise,
Yet the absurd in places the most unexpected lurks,
But something red about the nose and wrinkled round the eyes. And to drag it into daylight is the usefullest of works.
Cried STULTUS, “Lo! this chuckling clown is ever on the grin, Oft in the poet's ardour, the philosopher's vague dreams,
And sniggers in a chronic way that verges upon sin.
The zealot's hasty search of ends and lofty scorn of means,
He travesties the serious, the saered, the sublime,
Hides the Ridiculous, which, like the rift within the lute,
To furnish matter for a mirth that borders on a crime."
Shall jangle the philosophy and leave the minstrel mute.
“He hel" forth cackled FATUUS, “this prim and pompous prig Swift Humour sees and seizes it, mayhap, to make it plain
Is as incapable of jest as Behemoth of a jig;
To men of dull perception and sluggish gait of brain,
And since he has no sense of fun, no eye for the absurd,
Exaggerates to emphasise, not seeking to belie,
He'd put an end to joking-a rare joke, upon my word !”
But point by sly extravagance the truth it would imply.
“Not so," quoth STULTUS; “but this fool's irreverent burlesque Sense sees and takes cum grano, but sometimes the Seer and Sage,
Fast robs us of the passionate, the pure, the picturesque;
Blind to the small absurdities that blot their brightest page,
He lowers our ideals with his daubings, and debases
Resent detective Humour's quest which in them dares find fun,
The-well, the moral currency, by making ugly faces."
Flaws in the savant's theories, spots on the poet's sun.
“Yah !" FATUUS cried, "he simply lacks the faculty called risible; Nose-chipping Clown ! they hotly cry, confounding him with you,
And the most rare and screaming joke to him is just invisible. Oh, ever-giggling FATUUS! You see the harm you do!
Unknowing that Creation's full of what is queer and chaffable, We humorists should keep our calm, however Seers insult us;
He rages at us funny folk. It's really very laughable.'
That's shameful in a Jester which is natural to STULTUS.
“Buffoon!” shrieked STULTUS, scornfully. "Base parody of Mirth!” | Absurdity's my quarry, but I never hit on yet

“The opening services were held on Sunday last. In the morning the
place was filled by a respectable congregation, when the service was conducted
by the Rev. E. S. SHIELDS, who took for the text of his sermon the words of
Matthew xxi, 13—My house shall be called a house of prayer, but ye have
made it a den of thieves,' and also using the parallel passage in Mark xi. 17.”
In the evening Mr. SHIELDS preached another sermon, and a third
was delivered by the Rev. W. FILBY. With reference to these
sermons, inclusive of the morning sermon, we are further told that-
“ The whole of the discourses were eminently practical and appropriate.”
Not only practical, but likewise appropriate, and that not the
evening discourses alone, but the morning discourse, too, observe,
And yet the hearers of the latter discourse are expressly eulogised
as a respectable congregation. How, dear friends, could a discourse
have been appropriate to a congregation of any respectability if it
was at all appropriate to denizens of a den of thieves ? At any rate,
however, its preacher seems to have been a faithful minister and

CHAIRS! CHAIRS!
INDIA seems in a bad way; far worse

We hope Professor FAWCETT, or some other
Member of Parliament, will get to the bottom
of this most untimely “paucity of chairs,”
whereby proud and influential Chiefs were
prevented from personally testifying their
fidelity to the Sovereign Power. Why was

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
GIRLS AMONG GALLIPOTS.
R. J. BRADNELL GILL, of
Hastings, has sug-
gested, in print, that,
for medical men having
private surgeries, and for
chemists and druggists also,
who find a difficulty in ob-
taining dispensers to be de-
pended upon for honesty,
sobriety, and competence, it
would be advisable to em-
ploy female assistants, and
that fairly-educated women
could safely, comfortably,
profitably, and easily, un-
dertake that employment.
Clearly an excellent sugges-
tion. The girl who, through
inadvertence, would be likely
to put up tincture of opium
for black dose, or oxalio acid
for Epsom salts, substitute
corrosive sublimate for calo-
mel, or weigh out an overdose
of arsenic or tartrate of antimony, would be a very exceptional young
person. Hardly any decently taught damsel would be capable of
making such a blunder, were she ever so distractedly in love. For
the art of dispensing medicines, peculiar qualifications have been
conferred by Nature on the nimble-fingered, nice, and careful sex.
Exactness with respect to measure, and in matters of weight going
the length of scruples, would be insured by female scrupulosity.
Dexterity in packeting powders 'and draughts would come natural
to a neat-handed Phyllis. What could a general practitioner, then,
in want of a dispenser, do better than advertise for one of the gentler
gender; and would not many a young lady, with her living to earn,
aot a great deal more wisely in jumping at that offer than in ac-
cepting other offers that might be named, or, worse still by a long
chalk, "going out as a governess" on average terms ?
Besides, for a capable and intelligent maiden engaged in the sur-
gery, business might possibly ripen into something better, in case her
employer were a bachelor; namely & partnership, indissoluble except
by death or a decree nisi, in which the doctor would be enabled to
dispense with any other dispenser than his own wife.
If the man means the latter, I'll answer instanter.
The drowse of the dreary æsthetical Canter,
Absorbed in bad dreams and poetical flummery,
Is no more like life than sour milk is like Pommery,
And no more worth living than I'm worth a "plum.”
Life shaped on such lines is a lachrymose hum.
But give me ten thousand a year, my dear boy,
And I'll show them that life is a thing to enjoy,
And not to write poems and essays about,
Beginning in doldrums and ending in doubt.
Here's the tip that to mooners like MALLOCK I'd give :-
Life's only worth living to those who can live!
Neat and not nubilistic, I think you will say,
Which is just what we want in our fog-flustered day.
Clear sense and no clouds! That's my maxim all round,
And what duffer denies that the principle's sound ?
Metaphysical muddlement's not worth a rush,
Nor finical flam, nor emotional gush.
I hold that of all things, from Science to sherry,
From BURNE JONES's Art to the acting of TERRY,
A man of the world is the very best judge,
And what he can't fathom is mostly pure fudge.
Life's a plant, say the seers; well, don't poke at its roots,
But let the thing grow, and look out for its fruits.
I find them most tasty, in spite of dull stuff,
And my only complaint's that I can't get enough.
If a fellow will feed on green apples and sloes,
He becomes a dyspeptio, and gets a red nose;
And when a man comes to this dull ultimatum,
That life when summed up's vanitas vanitatum,
And fancies his verdict has settled the question,
He thinks it philosophy, I indigestion.
Ichabod ? Bosh! Å smart man scorns such trash;
It's merely a matter of health and hard cash.
Nine-tenths of the megrims in prose and in verse
Mean gastric disorder or leanness of purse.
With money and Moet, and love and good cookery,
Who dares say this world is a played-out old rookery ?
Only Trappists, and twopenny Timons, and fellows
Who, in search of the wind, must cut open the bellows.
It's all this confounded new fad for analysis,
This poking and prying that ends in paralysis.
Glissez, n'appuyez pas trop! That's the style.
There are chaps who'll dissect you a tear or a smile,
Till they fancy they've proved life is just protoplasm,
And love a mere vortex, and laughter a spasm.
Supposing they are, let's give thanks that, at present,
The whirl is delightful, the spasm is pleasant.
And as for the future, can pessimist prophet
Declare if it leads to Nirvana or Tophet?
No; he ends with a tag vague as fol-de-rol-lido,
And knows just as much of the issue as I do.
Real life's "real jam," and what I beg to state is
I'm not yet inclined to cry,“ Ohe! jam satis."
Worth living, or not, I shall play out my part,
And a fig for the funkers !
Yours truly,
JACK SMART.

A Serious Business.
In a leading article on the occupations and employments of Women
the other day, the Times observed that:-"A man and woman, when
they marry, constitute a firm,"-which, we may add, too often turns
out a partnership of unlimited liability.
FROM THE PHILISTINE POINT OF VIEW.
(Being the opinions of a Smart Young Man on Pessimism.)
“Est-il vrai que l'existence soit un malheur, et que le néant vaille mieux
que l'être ? Ces propositions sonnent étrangement aux oreilles des hommes
de notre temps étourdis par le bruit de leur propre activité, justement fiers
des progrès de la science, et dont le tempérament médiocrement élégiaque
s'accommode à merveille d'un séjour prolongé sur oette terre."
"Le Pessimisme au Dix-neuvième Siècle," par E. CARO.
DEAR DICK,
I've been reading-or trying to read-
A rum sort of volume, a book of a breed
That, like prigs and Phylloxera, seem to increase
At a rate that much threatens our fun and our peace,
I suppose, as the sapient DARWIN would say,
'Tis the Latest Development! Things will look gay
In our worried old world, that's so flouted by fogies,
If the rule of the roast's left to beetles and bogies.
Are the pests and the Pessimists plotting together,
With Lawson, BURNE JONES, and the Clerk of the Weather,
To make a clean sweep of all comfort and cheer,
And rob a poor world of its bliss with its beer?
Is Life worth the Living ? Now doesn't that look
A beautiful title to give to a book ?
What rot! Why, you might as well ask, to my thinking,
If Woman's worth loving or wine is worth drinking;
To which any donkey could answer off-hand
That of course it depends on the girl and the brand.
It's astonishing, Dick, what egregious bosh
These big-wigs will write! But it really won't wash
When a wordspinner, ranking himself among Sages,
Goes maundering on for some hundreds of pages,
To ask such a bogus old riddle as this is,
And finds at the finis the answer he misses.
Life! What sort of life? That's the crux, after all.
The life that a man about town would so call ?
Or some moony and spoony existence apart,
All very low spirits and very high Art ?
AN ENLARGED DEFINITION,

have been an end of the matter. The situation of the piece, when
once arrived at, is very strong, no doubt about it. But after that,
the last Act is tediously spun out, for the sake of a series of utterly
purposeless scenes between any of the characters whose parts it has

The last Act is a day after the fair, and a melancholy day, too.

At the Alhambra, LECOCQ's La Petite Mademoiselle has been suc-
cessfully produced. What the plot of this comic opera may be, after
sitting out three Acts, I have only the very vaguest idea-indeed,
I am perfectly certain, that, at this moment, if Mr. CHARLES MORTON
were at my head with a pistol, I could not tell it to save my life.
Perhaps the plot, like other conspiracies, is a secret. If so, nothing
on earth, not even a dinner given me by all the Directors of the
Alhambra Company, should coerce me to divulge it. But what does
the story matter? Nothing. Here are bright scenes, music with
plenty of “go" in it, graceful forms, good voices, first-rate band con-
ducted by Three-Fingered JACK OBI (I mean M. JACOBI,—but what's
become of that delightful old play, Obi; or Three-Fingered Jack?)

Sir Vernon the Challenger, loquitur.
ENOUGH of feints with blunted points !
My steel shall try his armour's joints
In desperate earnest now.
A champion unchallenged ? Stuff!
His fence is fine, his thews are tough,
Yet will I give him quantum suff.,
And make his destrier pant and puff,
Ere I have done, I trow.
Have I not brawn to stand a bout?
Sure seat in selle, a lance-arm stout?
Is not my sword-play swift and free: -
Well served by eye and wrist ?
Who is this Knight, that he should be
Unchecked of Liberal chivalry,
Lord of the knightly list?
Aha! he beareth on his shield
Three beacons flambant on a field
Vert, with a gerbe of rockets
For crest. l' faith, a fit device!
He's fond of fireworks, which are nice
For pastime, when the powder's price
Comes not from one's own pockets.
Our champions, if stout, are old;
If young, not deft nor over-bold:
Thence comes it that this Knight' doth hold
Unshaken seat so long.
But if he thinks to keep his post
By dint of mere thrasonic boast,
To frighten all our Liberal host,
And all unquestioned rule the roast,
By Jingo he is wrong!
Have at thee, Knight o' Squibs! Thy troop
Of myrmidons, who howl and whoop,
Methinks are scarce so cockahoop
As they erewhile appeared ;
Not quite so high they toss the cap,
Not quite so madly cheer and clap,
As late they clapped and cheered.
Tant mieux ! the better looks my chance.
I'll strike thy shield with pointed lance,
Game for a combat à outrance
E'en with so dread a knight.
Sound for the charge! Look out, my Lord !
No novice he at lance and sword
That dares thee to the fight.
Thy motto, “Peace with Honour,” palls
On varlets vexed with bungling brawls.
Thy spells have lost their might.
Mysterious as thou art, Sir Sphinx,
I rede thy riddle, and methinks
My steel can search thine armour's chinks
And make its weakness known,
Though, thanks far more to skill than force,
So many a sturdy Knight from horse
Thou hast by sleight o'erthrown.
I've learnt thy points in thine own school,
Dashing yet wary, keen but cool,
No easy dupe with feint to fool
Or flashing pass to blind;
I know the trick as well as thou.
The lists are here, the hour is now,
Nor lags the man behind.
Ring, showy shield, to point of lance-
Have at thee, trickster, à outrance !

REDUCED TO PRACTICE !
Our professional contemporary, the Medical Press and
Circular, does not often present its readers with obser-
vations of a facetious nature; but is not the following
paragraph fairly open to the suspicion of being intended
for a joke ?-
"THE DEPRESSION IN TRADE AND THE MEDICAL PRO-
FESSION.—The entry at the different Medical schools has been
very large this session. It is thought this is largely due to the
depression existing in commerce and agriculture. A number of
young men who, in ordinary circumstances, would have entered
a trade, or gone to farming, seeing little prospect in these
directions, have turned their attention to Medicine."
If this is a fact, how inexpensive those young men,
or their parents and guardians, must consider a medical
education, how easy the acquisition of anatomy, phre-
nology, chemistry, botany, and the rest of the medical
sciences, how slight the difficulty of passing an examina-
tion in them, how little arduous, lightly laborious, and
highly lucrative, the practice of the Medical Profession!
These youths might be told that, if in circumstances
insufficient to enable them to embark in commerce or
agriculture, they resort to Medicine with a view to money-
making, they may or may not go farther, but they will
| certainly fare worse.

How your chiefs dey neber cubbit lan an cattle not dere own;

See how well (unlike de Zulus) you can do widout perlice.

Till I feel like a hyæna in de gentle baa-lamb fold.

A CAUCUS QUESTION.
THE sitting Liberal Member for Dewsbury, Mr. Serjeant SIMON,
has served his constituents eleven years. A letter addressed to him
the other day by a Mr. S. N. LUMB, Secretary to “the Executive
of the Dewsbury Parliamentary Borough Joint Liberal Association
on the Birmingham plan," informs him that he had been nominated
by the body abovenamed as a candidate for the representation of the
borough aforesaid at the approaching election, and questions him as
follows:
“On behalf of the association, may I ask you whether you will allow your
name to be proposed at a general committee meeting to be held on Tuesday,
the 30th inst., and, if so, whether you will abide by the decision of the
association ?”
... "Submit,” that is, says Serjeant Simon, in reply, “to a competi-
tive process with eight other candidates proposed at the meeting to
which you refer.” Surely, the learned Serjeant might have added,
you must take me for a very simple Simon.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

NO PHYSIOLOGY !
THE Morning Post informs Society that
a resolution to petition Parliament for the
entire prohibition of Vivisection, proposed
at a meeting of the Anti-Vivisection Society
on Wednesday last week, was seconded by
a gentleman named BRAY, whose voice may
be claimed as that of a representative
speaker. Carried unanimously of course.
Whereupon :
“Mr. WALBROOK (Secretary) read a resolu-
tion which had just been passed at Blackburn of
congratulation on the progress of the movement,
and alluded to the G. H. LEWES' Studentship
for Original Research in Physiology (or Vivi-
section), for which that day was the latest for
applicants, and was to be open to women as can-
didates. This announcement was received with
strong expressions of surprise and disapproval by
the meeting."
By the above showing, Physiology, and
Vivisection, in the sight of the Secretary of
the Anti-Vivisection Society, and in the
eyes also of that more amiable than intel-
ligent association itself, mean the same
thing. Of course they are alike hostile to
both. But why are they surprised to hear
that a physiological studentship is open to
the gentler sex, and wherefore do they dis-
approve of that very reasonable arrange-
ment? It ought to be evident, even to the
Anti-Vivisection Society, that an animal
subjected to any operation involving pain
would probably suffer all the less under the
hands of one of the more tender-hearted por-
tion of mankind. Against a truism so
manifest as this, one would hardly expect to
hear a BRAY, even at a meeting of Anti-
Vivisectionists.

LEAVE AND NO LICENCE.
"THE Society for Improving Public Morals," --what-
ever that may be,-had a grand field-day with the Magis-
trates last Friday, when the Oxford Music Hall was
limited strictly to music without dancing, so that even a
break-down now would break up their establishment,-
when the Aquarium Manager was informed that appear-
ances, in spite of there being so few fish in the tanks,
were decidedly fishy, whereupon he took to his 'eels, with
a sorrowing cry very like a wail; and then the blameless
proprietor of the Argyll Rooms, was again told that his
valuable property wouldn't be licensed, whether as a' guile
or a' guilêless Rooms, and he too left, expressing his inten-
tion of giving up his stall in Westminster Abbey, and
probably feeling inclined to dean-ounce the Dean, and
load the Canons with abuse, for having taken so success-
ful a shot at him.
And then, O shade of dear old Paddy GREEN, always

VIEWS THROUGH THE INTERVIEWER.
ENCOURAGED by the reception given to the publi-
cation of an interview between “Lord” GLADSTONE
and a French reporter, a foreign journalist has called
upon Mr. Punch, with the following result:-
Reporter. You have read the speeches of GLAD-
STONE in the Gaulois and the Télégraphe ?
Mr. Punch. I have.
Reporter. You have learned nothing new from
their perusal?
Mr. Punch. Certainly not. Mr. GLADSTONE'S
opinions upon all subjects have been for a long
time public property.
Reporter. Having reached the great age of two
thousand numbers, doubtless you are well up in
the events of the day?
Mr. Punch. Very well.
Reporter. What is the chief characteristic of
Sir WILFRID Lawson ?
Mr. Punch. That he warmly supports the Per-
missive Bill.
Reporter. Lord BEACONSFIELD, too, is fond of
what has been called an “Imperial Policy" ?
Mr. Punch. You have reason for your assertion.
Reporter. I am right in believing that the
greatest Sage of this or any age resides at 85,
Fleet Street ?
Mr. Punch. Unquestionably.
Reporter. And that JOHN “BULL is a worthy
person who is frank to a fault, and hates humbug
in all its shades?
Mr. Punch. Yes.
Reporter. Lastly, I would ask whether there is
any truth in the report that Her Majesty Queen
ANNE is dead?
Mr. Punch, You are quite right. Queen ANNE
is dead!
The Reporter then retired, deeply sensible of
the value of the information he had elicited.

was one headed “Mysterious Affair at Hampstead."
This was sensational. So was the story of a man
wounded in the leg, and conveyed on a stretcher
to the police-station. What a chance for the re-
porter! But it finished with—“No weapon was

It is yet gloom around us,
But fruit can't be looked for
But 'tis not one side only
The day-spring seems slow;
This year of offence;
Breeds birds for the pit;
The clouds that have bound us
And what this cock is booked for,
What were crowing, if lonely
Lie still dark and low;
Is sound and not sense.
The challengers sit ?
But we hear the cocks crowing,
Brag and blooms in high-flung hill
Cock-a-doodles breed echoes,
And know 'tis a sign
So Manchester showers,
And strut prompts to strut,
That the night-time is going,
We scarce see or smell dunghill
And each pecker finds peckers,
The sun will soon shine.
For fragrance and flowers !
Each comb combs to cut.
Could the cocks' shrill view-holloa
There's the Stanley cock-famous
There's the Bright burly game-cock,
The sun rouse from bed,
His breed round Chat Moss ;
Of tough Rochdale strain,
Long ere this had Apollo
And the Ecoles Cross-game as
Prompt to prove he's the same cock
Un-night-capped his head;
He'd ne'er fought a Cross.
That won many a main.
But if day through night's curtain
There's the Northcote red-hackle,
He's old, you may tell us,
Be struggling to get,
Who shows sparring sleight,
But his heart is as good
'Tis only too certain
But lacks "devil” to tackle
As when, big of bellows,
It's not daylight yet.
A foe in hard fight.
His crow bespoke blood.
Yet the verge shows a glimmer
Still, whate'er they're at fighting, And there in the distance,
To weatherwise sight,
They're all game to crow-
Preparing to crow-
Though the dark may seem dimmer
To that now they're inviting,
The soul of resistance
_By contrast with light.
All round, friend and foe.
To BEAKY & Co.-
East and West, from day's borders,
Plucky cocks, and cocks cheeky,
The old cook of Ha'rden,
And night's, far and nigh,
And cock'rels more fit
The Cock of the Walk,
The cocks, their pens' warders,
To make cocky-leeky
Midlothian's yard in
Lift challenging cry.
Than peg in a pit.
Will soon "toe the chalk”!
There's Hatfield's black rooster-
With bodies a-tiptoe,
There's the Devonshire Ginger,
The bird for a show ! -
And throats on the strain,
Of challenge less loud,
Might his foe's feathered crew stir,
All for fight spurred and clipt, oh
But his spar is a swinger
Were combat all crow!
They look fighting fain.
By judges allowed.
His spurs bravely shown are,
As, from Bantam to Cochin,
Oxford's cock well I ween has
And big is his bruit-
From Dunghill to Game,
No foe he deigns fear,
In thy Garden, Pomona,-
They herald approaching
And his steel is as keen as
With more flowers than FRUIT!
Election-day's flame.
His clarion is clear.

I KINC DEATH
HIGH SHRIEVALTY REFORM,
RIGHT WORSHIPFUL MR. PUNCH,
GENTLEMEN who let fly at grievances in public prints should
fire with arms of precision-shouldn't they? Is it certain that this
rule has been quite respected by a Correspondent of the Times, who
complains of the exactions which he says await those who are
condemned to serve the office of High Sheriff ?
“The gentleman who immediately preceded me in my office," (writes
“R. 8. P.') “was fined £500 by the Chief Baron, for lodging his Lordship at
the first hotel in the town-his own residence being more than thirty miles
distant, and no suitable private residence could be had on any terms in the
assize town.”
Atrocious, if true. But when, if ever, was this enormity com-
mitted? What English Judge capable of anything so outrageous
has existed since Judge JEFFREYS-and was JEFFREYS ever Chief
Baron ?
No doubt a High Sheriff is laden with heavy charges. Very likely
High Sheriffs are of no use. Still, Mr. Punch, I hope we may trust a
Conservative Government not to be prevailed upon by the clamour
of a poverty-stricken aristocracy to abolish the ancient and venerable
office of High Sheriff. Why should the office be limited to owners
of the soil ? Let it at once be thrown open to large manufacturers,
big brewers, and other wholesale business men, and even to ordinary
shopkeepers sufficiently wealthy-grocers and tea-dealers, linen-
drapers, and tailors. Sir, I myself am the proprietor of extensive
artificial manure works, and I pay, I suppose, about ten times as
much Income-tax as my neighbour, Sir GEOFFREY_GASCOIGNE, with
his encumbered estate, most of it bare acres. He can derive no
additional consequence from being High Sheriff, and he can't afford
it, whereas I can, and the appointment would give me prestige,
besides answering the purpose of a capital advertisement for the

ORIGINAL VACCINATION.
A MOVEMENT is on foot to cause Vaccination to be per-
formed with lymph supplied by the calf. This is an
improvement deserving to be highly recommended ; be-
cause, in the first place, primary is more effectual than
intermediate Vaccination, and, in the next, Vaccination
from the calf direct can communicate nothing worse than
the cow-pock. The only objection, therefore, that can
possibly be made to it by fanatics is that which many
of them alleged against JENNER's original operation;
namely, that it will cause horns to sprout on the head of
a Christian, and develop the os coccygis into a tail.
But the word calf meaning both the animal and limb
of that name, ambiguity perhaps would be avoided if
instead of “Vaccination from the Calf," the process
were to be styled “ Vaccination from Veal.”

H.M. P.-O., St. Martin's-le-Grand,

SIR,- Before the Department can sanction the
erection of a wall-box where you suggest, it will be
necessary for you to notify your acceptance of the
office, which I should be glad to receive at once. You
will be good enough to wait upon the owners of the
property where the wall-box is to be erected, to obtain
their permission; have prepared by different masons
or builders three or four estimates of cost of erection,
and submit to me for approval; also, forward plan of
inside of your premises, showing, in red ink, what por-
tion you propose to use as the Post-Office, and position
of letter-box. The latter must be two feet deep, one
foot wide, and one foot across. It must be strongly
made, and provided with a patent look, the key of which
must always be in your own possession.
As the wall-box is nearly a mile from the office, you
will be allowed sixpence per week for collection. For
the delivery you will receive 1s. 6d. per week, and as
Postmaster you will receive in addition the sum of four
pounds per annum. I may add, the cost of erecting the
wall-box should not exceed four or five shillings.

Out of the chinks wherein he cleaves.

THE WHITE ELEPHANT TURNED “ROGUE.”
“ Elephants that, naturally vicious, have refused to associate with the herd, or that have been
detached from their former companions in search of fresh alliances, or elephants escaping from cap-
tivity, unable to rejoin their former herd and excluded from any other, become, what, from their
vicious propensities and predatory habits, are called 'Rogues' in Ceylon. They spend their time

in marauding, and will even break through fences without fear: by day generally seeking conceal-
ment, but often prowling about and attacking travellers, who run the utmost risk from their assaults.

must be warned against reading
between the lines when two
trains are coming ; in fact, if
they're reading at all, they'd
better remain on the platform.
Of course this is a mere matter of
plat-form. A Bill in Parliament
is necessary to get up the steam
for any new line, and when the
mighty engine of the law has done
its work, the ground is got over
rapidly, and the Company are in
possession of a "Legal tender.”
The Railway Commissioners sit
during term time and direct all
examinations for commissions in
the (Railway) Guards. Any one
can be a ticket-taker, the only
necessary qualification being to
possess the right sum of money to
take a ticket, and to go to the
office at the correct time. There

RALEIGH CLUB.-Sometimes
called Rawleigh, sometimes Ray-
leigh. For example, in the latter
case, if you are pointing out the
building to a friend, and observe,
“That's the Rayleigh,” you must
look for the reply, "Is it raylly ?"
If looked upon as Rawleigh, no
member can expect his chop to
be thoroughly done, as it would be
contrary to the traditions of the
Club. Some pronounce it“Rally,"
under the impression that it was
founded by Sir WALTER RALLY,
the great pantomimist of Queen
ELIZABETH's Court. He used to
go about with a bit of a cloak
like a square piece of carpet, which
he would put down in the street,
and then go through a perform-
ance, accompanying himself on
his pipe. He was of a placid and
contented disposition, and history
records that he only once showed
any annoyance, and that was when

was on fire, emptied a bucket of
water over him, and Sir WALTER
owned to having been considerably

I've been photographed like this
(Shows an awfully naked truth)
Save a cow-tail apron bare-
And feel how I must have shocked
A virtuous Lord Mayor !
So, henceforth, if I'm photographed,
I'll be photographed like that-
(Shows a modestly-veiled impropriety)
In square-cut Quaker dittoes,
And a broad-brimmed Quaker hat!
When thus chastely, warmly covered
From indecency and cold,
If Mr. PHILPOTTS sells me,
I hope he won't be sold,
And charged with an indecent
Exposure in the streets,
And sentenced to do penance
In damp Collodion sheets.
Henceforth, in kraal and cottage,

From CETEWAYO unto NoTTAGE,
Be' men and brothers too!

To the same task they set 'em,

“Well, we keep up the name; but we get all our

"And your milk and butter ?”
“Oh, from all over the place-except England. About
a hundred years ago an enterprising foreigner discovered
how to keep butter and milk sweet for any length of

I fell asleep."

sheep, poultry, milk, cheese, butter, green crops, corn,
fruit, vegetables, everything! They all come from abroad
nowadays!"
“And how do you pay for 'em ?” asked Rip.
“Pay! Bless you," said the farmer, “ we don't pay.
They give 'em us. Still, a man must have pocket-
money and his little 'luxuries.'”
“Yes, certainly,” said RIP, consolingly. “And what
do you do for them?"
"Well, we have had to take up a trade that the
Yankees have quite discarded. Since they have become

Other Lord Mayors have been prime, but this one will
be Primer ; nay, we venture to prophesy he will be Long
Primer:
A Brilliant career may be predicted for him ; he will be
the Minion of neither Court nor faction. He is English
to the backbone; and scores of aspirants will contend
for the honour of having been the first to affirm that he
is a Nonpareil.
If he is not a fountain of honour, he can point with
pride to a Fount of type.
Let Italian or Venetian masts be erected in his Ward,
and for the nonce let them be called Italic !
In politics it is understood that he is Conservative,
and that his views are likely to be Stationary rather than
progressive.
More than the usual Stereotyped compliments will be
paid to him.
His hospitality will be unbounded—the First Proof

not forget the Press.
Small Capitals may boast their Mayors, their Provosts,
their Syndics, but our Lord Mayor is connected with the
Biggest Capital in the world.
A sword of honour will be borne before him-not a
Composing-stick.
He will be tenacious of ceremony-and Form.
All the invitations from the Mansion House during
his year of office will be in Black Letter with Rubricated
Capitals.

IN MEMORIAM.
John Baldwin Buckstone.
BORN AT HOXTON, SEPTEMBER, 1802;
DIED AT LOWER SYDENHAM, FRIDAY, Oct. 31, 1879.
On the far-off suburban graveyard's hush
Breaks the slow clangour of the burial bell;
Through close-set ranks of stones this press and push,
Of an old Actor's “last appearance" tell.
Spite of the shuffling of converging feet,
And hum of tongues at funeral pitch, one hears,
Across the monotone of the bell's beat,
Faint echoes of the laughs of fifty years.
Poor “ BUCKY” can this last large house command,
On his last Act the curtain down to bring ;
Leaving the stage, for once, without a hand,
Waking sad sigh and thought, for mirth's shrill ring.
'Tis well that men should love what makes them laugh,
Memory and mirth find ties of golden thread,
That Time's kind hand should winnow out the chaff,
Which brings no grist to living or to dead.
Let none to-day for moral or for flout
Mark how, or why, in sickness and sore need
The lamp that long had burned so blythe went out;
Think rather how its oil our lamps could feed
With light of laughter, from the brimming cruise
That for so many years ran never dry.
Author and Actor-give the man his dues,
And who large debt to BUCKSTONE will deny?
" Ashes to ashes! Dust to dust!” we hear
The pellets' rattle on his coffin-lid,
Like the last knell of many memories dear-
Glad times, glad faces, in the past long hid!
Ask if, for all that recklessness of his
That round life's rocks and reefs steered oft-times wide,
He had a kindly heart? The answer is,
From these his comrades ranged at his grave-side.
They knew, none knew so well, the open hand,
The unjealous mood, quick al desert to read;
Tongue that to beg in comrade's cause was bland,
Ear that, deaf else, was never deaf to need.
The staunchness to old mates, that sometimes strained
Tether of patience, till pit, box, and stall
“That he was blind as well as deaf” complained,
When for friends' sake Art oft went to the wall.
Light lie the turf on the old Actor's bier :
Of many a load he lightened many a heart:
A more mirth-making mime for many a year
We are not like to see. 'Tis sad to part,
And leave him lying here, out in the cold,
Who held such cosy corners of our past!
Farewell, old “ BUCKY," many a heart will hold
Thy memory green, for all shades o'er it cast !

S
yet with a certain modesty consistent with the
position of so young a barrister in so important
a case.
On the first night there were two distinct
and equal triumphs, that of Shylock, and that
of Portia. The piece is beautifully placed on
the stage, every scene being a perfect picture.
For the rest of the dramatis persona,--Mr.
| BEAUMONT was not half a Doge- perhaps if he
were BEAUMONT and FLETCHER together, he
might have been stronger. Mr. TYARS as the
Prince of Morocco, or the other Moor of
Venice-Othello the Less, instead of Othello
the Moor-was very good. Antonio was like
the Anthony in the old song of “ Froggee
would” whose lay is always “ Heigho! said
Antonio Rowley." Mr. BARNES decidedly
“stood out” aš Barnes-anio-I mean Bas-
sanio-and posed a bit too much, under the
impression that he was exhibiting “ gallant
bearing." He was also too impatient and off-
handed in the Trial Scene-a defect which, no
doubt, by this time he has remedied, and has
become deeply interested in what is likely to
be a protracted case. Lorenzo is “nice."
The Gobbos, père et fils, are not particularly
| humorous ; their old - fashioned,' wearisome
traditional stage business ought to be re-
arranged. Jessica obtained a laugh when she
throws a good-sized casket, apparently across
a canal, at Lorenzo's head, which might have
induced an exclamation of “Well fielded!”
from the irrepressible, and imperilled the
situation.
The last Act always disappoints me-not by
its language, which is beautiful; not by its
comedy, which is amusing; but because poor
old Shylock does not reappear. I should like
| him to drop in on that happy party in rich
Venetian evening dress-not as he went out to
supper with Salarino & Co., like Guy Fawkes,
with a lantern and tinder-box-to express his
sorrow for the trouble he has caused, and then
speak the lines which Nerissa now speaks, about
the deed of gift to Lorenzo and Jessica-adding,
of course, “ Take her, you young dog of a

The late Mr. CALVERT used to end the play
with a poetically conceived scene of moonlit
silence in the great hall of Belmont, with Portia
and Bassanio looking on the still night from a
window in the gallery. It was very effective,
and would have offered a really good excuse
for the return of Shylock, who, out of reve-
rence for “the Bard,” might have expressed
everything in dumb show, and handed over the
deed of gift in pantomime. In fact, the deed,
and not the word, is the only thing required.

first Acts, but, to my thinking, monotonous in the terror
of the last scene. It is quite possible that real fright
might transform a lusty country squire into the limp and
deplorable creature presented by Mr. Brough, but the
comedian's first duty is to reconcile truth with humorous
presentment of his part. Mr. EVERARD's Sir Lucius was
quiet, gentlemanlike, and unexaggerated-in short, "less
Irish and more nice” than he usually is on the stage.
Altogether, The Rivals at the Aquarium deserves to be
seen by those who seek good time-sanctioned “classical”
enjoyment at the theatre. It is not to be had too often.
Within a week, Mr. TOOLE appears at the Folly, with

Miss NELLIE FARREN plays that amiable tenor, Francis
0-baldistone, whose initials, “F. 0.,” stand for "Foreign

being quite her office to represent the hero of burlesque.
The Adelphi gives us a notable example of what can
be done, and also what can't be done, with a bad piece,
by an exceptionally good cast. Mr. NEVILLE as John
Browdie is the very spit of what Mr. TENNIEL'S JOHN
BULL of the Punch Cartoons must have been when about
twenty-five. Mr. VEZIN is excellent as Newman Noggs,
in a marvellous make-up, the actor's individuality being
completely destroyed. And this is equally true of Mr.
R. PATEMAN, whose Brooker, the depressed villain, is as
good a performance as can be seen in a character so con-
ventionally melodramatic. Mrs. MELLON looks a deal too
kind for Mrs. Squeers, but it is always a pleasure to see
her at the Adelphi, and to forgive her for remaining as
nature made her. The Coach Scene is most effective,
though some might object to the coach as stagey.

THE NEW ENONE.
AN EPIC FRAGMENT.
(With Apologies to the Poet Laureate.)
O BRITISH Public, many-fadded public,
Queer British Public, harken ere I die !
It was the bright forenoon: one silvery cloud
Had with soft sprinkle laid the gathered dust
Of Mayfair. To the studio they came.
Scant-robed they came before the Camera.
And at their feet was laid a carpet fair,
Lemon, and cinnamon, and ghostly grey,
Purple, and primrose. And the artist rose
And overhead the swift spring-curtains drew
This way and that in many a subtle shift
For fine effect of light and shade, and placed
Background of statuary and drooping boughs,
With cloud and curtain, tower and portico.
O British Public harken ere I die!
I heard great Heré. She to Paris made
Proffer of popular power, public rule
Unquestioned, an elastic revenue
Wherewith to buoy and back Imperial plans,
Honour (with Peace) she said, and tax and toll
From many a Place of Arms and haven large,
And Scientific Frontiers, and all else
That patriotic potency may crave;
To all most welcome, seeing men in power
Then only are like gods, having attained
Rest in another place," and quiet seats
Above the tumult, safe from Dissolution,
In shelter of their great majority.
O British Public harken ere I die!
She ceased, and Paris held the golden fruit
Out at arm's length, so much the thought of power
Flattered his spirit; but Pallas where she stood
Somewhat apart, her straight and stately limbs
Uplifted, and her aspect high, if cold.
The while above her full and earnest eye
Over her firm-set mouth and haughty cheek
Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply.
“Unselfishness, high honour, justice clear,
These three alone give worth to sovereign power.
Yet not for power (power of itself
Is a base burden) but to hold as law
The fiat high, 'Be just and do not fear,'
And because right is right to follow right,
With a serene contempt of consequence.”
And Paris pondered, and I cried, “O! Paris,
Give it to Pallas!" But he heard me not,
Or hearing, would not heed me. Woe is me!
0! British Public, many-headed Public,
Crass British Public, harken ere I die!
Audacious Aphrodite, beautiful
Fresh as the purple hyacinth's rain-washed bells,
With soft, seductive fingers backward drew
From her bold brow and bosom her long hair
Auricomous, and bared her shining throat
And shoulder; on the carpet her small feet
Shone lily-like, and on her rounded form,
Between the shadows of the studio blinds,
Shifted the cunning “high lights" as she moved.
0! British Public, harken ere I die!
She, with a subtle smile in her bold eyes,
The herald of her triumph, well assured,
Half whispered in his ear," I promise thee
The negative of my next photograph.'”
She spoke and laughed, I shut my eyes in fear,
And when I looked, Paris had not the apple.
And I beheld great Here's angry eyes
As she withdrew from forth the studio door,
And I was left alone within the place!

DEAR MR. PUNCH,
As I know you are interested in the cause of Education, as well as in
everything which concerns the weal of our down-trodden country, I send you
the subjoined extract from the Clare Independent and Tipperary Catholic Times
of November 8th, which will, I hope, convince you that the “Island of the
Saints" is now, as it has ever been, in the van of intellectual progress.
Yours, AN IRISH PATRIOT.

tion, qualifying them for the Competitive Examinations for all Civil, Naval and Military
appointments.
The French language of which Mr. R. possesses a most critically accurate Pronunciation
as to its Elisions, Intonation and Modification of voice, he teaches with that graceful
Undulation of sound which particularly characterises a well-bred Parisian. Let it not,
therefore, be inferred that it is French as it is usually taught by uneducated Governesses,
and by many of those Illiterate Foreigners, with their Grammaires, Vocabulaires, and
Indispensables, &c., &c.
Besides being the Literal Translator of a number of MOORE's most popular melodies
and other Songs into Greek, Latin, French and Italian of the same Metrical Composition
and Rhythmical harmony as the originals, and which, therefore, can be sung and played
to the same airs, Mr. R. can also produce numerous escapades of his own composition in
the way of hymns, songs, &c.
In evidence of what Mr. R. here states of himself, he can produce the written testimony
of the most exalted in rank, the most dignified by profession, and the most eminent in
learning of all religious denominations in this kingdom.
A series of adult evening classes will also be opened of which due notice shall be given.

of distinction in high literary circles, as time and space will hereafter permit.

But so long as Time flies,

There was a low affirmative wail. Then the thirteen greatest men
in England parted without another word.
A REALLY LIBERAL TENANT.
The carriages have been setting down their distinguished occupants
at the gate of the great City Banquet Hall. Slowly and with heavy
tread some of the most illustrious guests of the evening have tottered
up the richly felted stairs. The chief official in charge of the hats
has looked after them wistfully. He has been here for many a night,
but has never yet seen a sight like this. “The Ministers are ex-
tremely depressed and unhappy!” he has murmured to himself.
He is right. They are. But a cheery step recalls him to his
duties. A bright, bounding figure, jubilant with good humour,
passes him, taking the stairs lightly three at a time. There is no
mistaking this joyous apparition. It is the Prime Minister.
He has approached his colleagues now. They are huddled to-
gether, helpless, on a Persian rug. He goes up to them with the air
of a conqueror. “Good news!” he cries, triumphantly. "I have
good news! It is peace-not war! We have a new front. We
shan't want the Duke to-night. He isn't coming!”
A sigh of intense relief has broken from the now flushed Ministers,
but they can say nothing. They can only shake hands all round in
grateful silence.
"Yes,” continues their chief, brightly, “we shall have no blaze
-but an announcement! You stare? I tell you, Gentlemen,
Afghanistan, South Africa, Turkey, BISMARCK, the Deficit-every-
thing, will be merged in one glorious bit of news!”
The Ministers hesitate no longer. They give a ringing cheer.
The Lord Mayor hears it five rooms off, and is startled, But the
Premier continues-

THE members and adherents of the
United Kingdom Alliance at Peterborough
and thereabouts, impelled by a happy
thought, invited the Dean of PETERBOROUGH
to take part in a meeting held in that town
on Wednesday last week, in favour of
"local option. According to request, the
Dean appeared on the Temperance Plat-
form, and thence delivered an address on
the side of genuine sobriety.
“He did not wish to appear there under false
colours. He agreed with the previous speakers
as to the awful consequences of drunkenness, and
he believed that total abstinence was the only
cure for the habitual drunkard. There he must
stop; he could not go one atom further. He was
not a total abstainer himself. He had tried it
three times, and he believed if he had not taken
stimulants, as his medical attendant told him, he
should not have been there speaking to them
then. He did not admit the necessity for every
one to be a total abstainer, and could not admit

against its use. They might just as well say
that the polygamy of the Turk was an argument
against marriage as that the abuse of drink was
an argument against its use..... He did not
like to be tyrannised over by a majority, and he
would resist it to the death. ... The Dean was
frequently cheered."
Perhaps the parties who cheered the
Very Reverend and Very Reasonable
speaker were disciples of Sir WILFRID
Lawson converted by the Dean of PETER-
BOROUGH's just remarks from compulsory
teetotalism. The rest would do well duly to
reflect on the Dean's declaration that" he did
not like to be tyrannised over by a majority,
and he would resist it to the death.” A
tyrannical majority is to the victims of its
tyranny a collective tyrant just as detest-
able as an individual despot; and who
that, scorning to be a slave, would resist
the one to death, would not, to the best of
his ability, with all his might and main,
resist the other ?

Case, Examination-in-Chief, Cross-Examination, Re-Examination,

suited to superior temples of Themis, will, at least, be good for the
County or Police Court.
1. Find out the depth of your client's pocket, and draw your fees
accordingly-in advance.
2. Let your Junior Clerk take instructions. (This saves trouble.)
3. Apply for an adjournment, as soon as the case is called. (By
this means you will obtain a second fee.)
4. Let the Judge or Magistrate do all the work (they like it); and
whenever His Honour (or “Worship,” as the case may be) says
anything funny, be convulsed with silent laughter.
5. Say as little as you can yourself, and do not try to be the least
clever or witty.
6. Should your client gain his cause, rise and denounce his
opponent, and ask for costs.
7. Should he lose it, shrug your shoulders, and tell him he would
have been worse off but for you.
8. In any event, send in a bill for further costs, after the case is
concluded.
N.B.-By following these instructions you are sure to gain the
respect and esteem of your clients and all who may come in contact
with you.
What! Sixteen years! It seems but now
That Fleet Street saw him to her bow-
Ah me!-he well remembers how
His heart gave one great thump,
When o'er that sweet face flashed a smile
Sweeter than graced the mile on mile
Of welcome and good will, the while
Those bright eyes scanned his hump!
Yes, sixteen years! With you 'twere base
To hint at years, but that I'trace
Each year new sweetness in your face,
As if your kind years run
Each with the gift of some new grace,
Outdoing what they've done.
'Tis not that Punch-as leal as wise-
Loves less his QUEEN by closer ties,
Though she but rarely glads his eyes,
From Deeside and from Wight.
“The absent still are in the wrong !?"
So runs a French saw current long;
But Punch's loyalty is strong,
Be who will wrong or right.
So, Sagest Sage to Fairest Fair,
He cries, “ Long liye his Princess rare,
May she be happy-such his prayer
And bright years, as you move,
Bring her no care but how to bear
The burden of our love!

"Nor deal in watchwords overmuch."-TENNYSON.
(Being a Dickens of a Dickensionary for the use of Visitors to the
Metropolis.)
THE SEVEN DIALS.--The one central spot in London where the
time of day is kept. The Seven Dials is one of the finest sights-
just as the National Gallery was one of the finest sites-in Europe.
The Seven Dials are the work of seven renowned mechanicians,
known as the Seven Wise Men, who travelled from the East in the
very early part of the thirteenth century. Neither the atmosphere,
nor the population, of London, was quite so dense as at present, and
therefore the Wise Men who professed to “catch the sun's rays on
their dials," were considered as benefactors by quite the densest por-
tion of the population, who expected to see the rays caught, bottled,
and ultimately used for germinating cucumbers. Seven elegant
works of art were then commenced under dedication to St. Giles.
But on its being discovered that the sun's rays were not caught, and
that the Wise Men required to be remunerated for their labour, the
infuriated populace set upon them, and would have burnt them at
the stake, where the flames would have been kindled by several
volumes of their erudite memoranda called Dial Logs, which being
uncommonly dry, would have flared up at once. The Wise Men
having been sufficiently wise to quit these hospitable shores, never
returned, and the materials of the Dials were used for the construc-
tion of the same number of superior clocks which now form the orna-
ment of this quarter, preserving the tradition and the name of the
Seven Dials. The Dials are wound up twice a-year, i.e., on the
thirty-second of February, and the first of April, when crowds
assemble to witness this ceremony-one of the most imposing in
London. The first idea of Dials came undoubtedly from Egypt; that

A WORD FOR THE WOMEN.

to stand in an over-crowded railway-carriage, while well-
dressed young members of the "'ARRY-stocracy” are
comfortably seated. Male Man, old or young, must take
his chance, and has no right to plead manners on his own
behalf.
Nor is it everyone who is of CHARLES LAMB's opinion
about “the sacredness of female eld.” But most of
our sex, it is thought, are ready to recognise the claims
of young womanhood, particularly with good looks to
back them. Let me correct this impresssion, by exactly
describing what I saw on the North London Line the
other day. The seats were all filled in our carriage,
when a modestly-mannered and modestly-dressed girl
got in, exactly like the pretty young creatures JOEN
LEECH used to draw for us in the olden-I mean my
younger—time. Three young fellows occupied the seats
on either side the door against which she stood. One was
puffing a cheap cigar, another reading a red-and-yellow
railway novel, the third pretending to sleep, with his
hands resting on the head of his flashy cane. Not one
stirred all through the ride!
Again and again I have seen pretty and delicate-
looking girls, though of no higher rank, I am bound to
add, than shop-attendants, or milliners' workwomen in
all probability, on their way to their daily work, treated
in the same un-cavalier fashion by well-dressed men.
In fact, “every man for himself" seems to be the rule
on the East End lines. The offer of a seat to a crowded-
out woman, young or old, is the exception.
It is said that Mrs. TROLLOPE's telling pen-and-ink
caricatures cured the Americans of throwing their legs
on tables and over chair-backs. I can't help thinking a
few of Mr. Punch's pen-and-pencil pictures might work
an improvement, if not a cure, of the unmanly state of
things I have described. I believe half of it arises from
shyness; but it seems fast hardening into custom, and

Speaks it of dying life or living death?
One seems to see-so doth the canvas speak-
The swift soft sibilation of her breath.
So sits she, shadowing mysteries manifold,
In incomplete expectancy of-what?
Perhaps 'tis of an influenza cold,
Perhaps, again, 'tis not!
Languor supprest, quivering intensity,
And unripe insufficiency of self,
Speak in each eyelid broad, and caverned eye,
*And ridgèd clavicle's projecting shelf.
Deep sympathies of crescent womanhood,'
Keen urgency of unperfected love,
Dull aching thrills, as of half-frozen blood,
That may not freely move,
Such aches as chaste desires-and chilblains-give.
Oh! quite too perfect quiteness of sick sweetness,
What subtly sensuous symphonisms live
In thy soft sumptuousness of calm completeness!
In which-ah! curse of Momus and his mockings !-
Nought sees the ribald, rash, Philistine fool,
Save a sham-shepherdess sans shoes and stockings,
Foot-paddling in a pool !
As Good as a Pantomime.
We learn from the Roman Correspondent of the Daily News
that:
“Signor CAJROLI and Signor DEPRETIS have been busied in the forma-
tion of a Cabinet, to take up the work of the Government pretty much where
it was broken off in July."
When to this is added that
“— the President of the Budget Commission may be brought in to answer
the expected criticism of Signor GRIMALDI,"
-no wonder if we anticipate that the criticism of Signor GRIMALDI
will be “ Here we are again!"
What precious pregnancy of pulsing life!
What vast potentialities of passion!
What strange reluctance with desire at strife!
The robe's white tissue, cut in clinging fashion,
Against her coy carnations, warmly wan,
Shines like to tarnished silver's chastened sheen,
Her flesh-tints pure are joy to gaze upon,
Purple, and grey, and green!

Ispondents accompanying Armies in the Field). -A gag.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BONDS AND BENEFICES.
UR venerable friend,
dear old Archdeacon
DENISON, the other
day, addressing a meeting |
of the English Church
Union at Manchester, said
some good things as usual.
Having premised that Lord
PENZANCE had been
"shoved into a position
he was unfit for," and pre-
dicted that “on Saturday
he would either complete
his character for folly by
sending Mr. MACKONOCHIE
to prison, or fold his hands
and go to bed,” the reso-
lute and determined Aroh-
deacon declared that:-
“Members of the Church
Union would not deviato a
hair's breadth from their posi-
tion. They could not suffer
death like martyrs of old, but
they could suffer bonds or im-
prisonment-
That is, for persisting
in Romanesque and illegal
practices. They certainly
can possibly suffer imprisonment; but, if they court it, let us
hope they won't get it, so as not to be enabled to pose as Martyrs
and Confessors. But the truest thing our Archdeacon said was,
that the parties he referred to “could suffer bonds." They not
only can, but do. They are in bondage to Artioles which they
ignore, and obligations which they violate; and they could free
themselves at will from these bonds by disendowing and disestab-
lishing themselves, but prefer to remain in them because their bonds
hamper them so little as to allow them morally, or rather immorally,
to dance hornpipes in fetters.
OF
DECREE
For thirty years and six, think of his life!
To keep a wary eye and ready tongue,
With blithe cheer for all sides, let party-strife
Rage ne'er so bitter, 'mid the missiles flung
From hand to hand, hatred to hatred, still
To feel no hate, and own no captain's beck:
To wield power with soft word but iron will,
Correct class-claims, and pen-presumptions check.
Wooed, welcomed, worshipped, to be stone to smile;
To list the pretty prayer, and yet not yield;
To be all things to all with honest guile,
Frank behind mask, and open under shield.
Awake while we slept, his day was the night.
Beside the shaded lamp his tireless eye
Through the dark hours was watchful still and bright,
To focus the world's face as it swept by.
E'en Science taxed him, brought him larger load,
Harder to trim, and heavier to bear :
When through the unsleeping wires unresting flowed
The tide of news to winnow, sift, and share.
Still he found strength and spirits, Nature's balm,
Year after year, till those who watched him knew
Blanks in his blitheness, rufflings of his calm,
And slower speech for thought that flagged, not flew.
And the strong hand, for the hard helm too weak,
Was fain to rest, first for brief spell, and then
Still longer rest and longer had to seek,
Till we knew this born Captain among men
Had handed over charts and signal-book,
And sailing-orders and all captain's gear,
For leisure and repose hard by the nook
Where he drew breath, to watch green leaves and sere,
And tend his garden and his stock, and live
Among the country squires a country squire.
Alas! he had but little time to give
To that late idyl--not e'en time to tire.
Death finding him, unwontedly, at rest,
Smote him who, till now, seemed too swift and strong
For dart or scythe, too prompt and labour-stressed
To hear the summons all must hear ere long.
Rest in thy grave, that knew no resting here,
Editor without equal, strenuous soul,
Staunch friend, despising favour, scorning, fear,
Far-seeing, forward-cleaving to thy goal.
He left a different scene from that he found,
And had a large part in all change he saw.
Nor slave, nor leader, of his time, but bound
Abreast of it to keep its glass from flaw.
And not a hostile hand is raised to throw
A black stone at his name, who in his place
Had need to fight and fling so many a foe,
But ne'er fought false, nor struck but at the face.
'Tis one who served him twenty years who writes
This tribute to his memory. Those that read
May well be proud of him, and pray our fights
In Freedom's cause breed men like him at need.

IN MEMORIAM.
Yohn Thaddeus Delane.
FOR THIRTY-SIX YEARS EDITOR OF THE “Times."
Born at Bracknell, Berks, 1817. Died at Ascot Heath, Nov. 22, 1879,
THROUGH the dark hours one sleepless workshop strains,
With strength of busy brain and lightning hand,
Engines of iron hands and all but brains,
To fix in words the whirl of sea and land.
The daily paper-brain-core of our times,
To which Earth's nerves with lightning pulses thrill,
Whence promptings to all classes, creeds, and climes
Speed to take shape in action good or ill.
Work still finds man or makes him ; need provides
The central pivots of this central toil,
Brains of this brain-stuff, guiders of these guides,
Fresh under their night's load, calm through its coil.
If all these centres, brains, guides had been asked
To name one centre, brain, guide of them all,
For many a year the answer had not tasked
Long time or thought; one name had had the call —
His name, who, from his schoolboy days, was marked
By wise eyes for the work he was to do;
Who-youth still-mate first, master soon, embarked
On the great ship, that, with him, greater grew.
The old salts saw, and bent a scornful brow;
At“ WALTER'S 'three-year-olds?" the laugh went round.
Youth at the helm, not Pleasure at the prow-
The good ship Times sailed, on bold venture bound.
And from that time The Times was JOHN DELANE,
Till e'en that iron frame was warped and worn,
And those tense brain-springs slackened 'neath the strain
Of such toil as man's strength has rarely borne.
The Pacific Main.
It appears that the Pacific Republics, two to one, Peru and Bolivia
against Chili, now for some time at war, originally fell out for the
possession of nitrate and guano beds; so that, in fact, they have
been fighting over fertilising material. In this particular the
belligerents may be thought to exhibit some resemblance to poultry-
yard combatants; though it may be doubted whether on either side
they have signalised themselves by any display of valour analogous
to that of the gamecook as compared with the less noble barn-door fowl.
However, at Iquique there has recently been some warm work,
wherein Chili, nevertheless, got the advantage. This, it is to be
hoped, may lead to a termination of a struggle which certainly does
not “beat cock-fighting,” however analogous it may be to battles
between feathered champions, each on his own dunghill.

(After Scott's “ Lady of the Lake.”)
DUMFOUNDERED at the Southron's jaw,
Quoth the Unknown, “ What right of law
Hast thou Midlothian's vote to sue,
Without a pass from bold BUCCLEUCH?”
"What right?! My pass, in tongue-fence tried,
Hangs in my mouth, not easy tied.
And sooth to tell,” the Southron said,
“ This time I much shall need its aid.
Although for but a week I'm out,
Six columns daily I've to spout.
Though while there's pen and postcard known,
My taste for peace and rest I own."
“ Then why this wordy venture try?”
“Partisan thou, and ask me why?
Enough I seek to drive from place
Lord B.'s black band, our land's disgrace.
Slight reason may suffice to guide
An errant Statesman's wanderings wide;
A gauntlet thrown, a speech gainsaid,
Proffer of rugs or breeks or plaid;
Or, if the path be dangerous known,
The danger's self is lure alone."
“But Stranger, speech-primed though you came,
To spoil Imperialism's game,
How in Midlothian dare to show
BUCCLEUCE's avowed and mortal foe?”
Answered Stout WILL,—"BUCCLEUCH, no doubt,
Is honourable as he 's stout;
In fact, a right good sort, and I
Feel for the Chief no enmity.
But by proud promise I am tied
To matoh me with a man of pride.
To talk I seek Midlothian now,
But when I come again, I trow,
I come with banner, band, and bow,
As strong man seeks strong man for foe.
No placeman spying chance of pow'r
E'er hungered for the approaching hour,
As I to see before me stand
This Tory Chieftain and his band."
“Have then thy wish !” He whistled shrill,
And he was answered with a will.
Sudden from their concealment rose,
Fellest if funniest of foes,
The Faggot-Voters one and all,
In answer to their Chieftain's call.
Fresh levied troops, but game to fight
Till all was blue. From left to right,
Before, behind, above, below,
Sprang up at once the lurking foe.
That whistle thronged Midlothian's glen
With Faggot-laden franchised men.
That host ticked duly off, and tied,
The Unknown's eye surveyed with pride,
Then fix'd calm eye and kindling brow,
Full on Stout WILL—“How say'st thou now?
These are Midlothian's Voters new,
And, Southron, I'm the bold BUCCLEUCI !”
WILL was true grit:-Deep in his heart
These Faggot Votes provoked a smart.
He manned himself with dauntless air,
Gave back BUCCLEUCA his haughty stare,
His back 'gainst principles he bore,
Planted his foot firm on the floor,
“Come one, come all! the Truth shall fly
From its broad base as soon as I !”

THE MAGPIE.
(A Modern Study, after Couper and l'incent
Browne.)
THERE is a Bird, who, by his note,
And by the motley of his coat,
Is known to all the town;
A constant haunter of back-stairs,
Eaves-dropping nooks, and area lairs,
And keyholes up or down.
He has a look, though sly, elate,
Whose twinkle seems to indicate
Chronic internal chuckle ;
A port to all occasions squared,
And, as events may turn, prepared
To menace, trim, or truckle.
Fond of the Spy's ignoble part,
He haunts the Court, the Camp, the Mart,
And there securely pries
Into Church, State, and Fashion's show,
And all that occupies below
The great, the good, the wise.
Think you that as he spies he muses
On morals sage or honest uses
Of all that doth befall ?
Not so, too high the bird you rate,
No such thought in his hollow pate
Finds room or place at all.
He sees in that huge roundabout,
The World, with all its motley rout,
Its jostlings, and its jars,
Its loves, its needs, its wars, its creeds,
Its public or its private deeds,
Materials for "pars."
With pander smile or cynic sneer,
Sycophant smirk or satyr leer,
According as the matter
Is smartly false or simply true,
Of Court rose-pink or cad's broad blue,
He does-what does he ?-chatter!
With vulture-beak he loves to tear
The veil from privacy, and bare
All to the prurient rabble.
If hearts be wrung or cheeks be flushed,
Modesty outraged, proud hopes crushed,
N'importe !-the bird must babble !
With eye of Peeping Tom, and tongue
That to the wind all rule hath flung
Of honour, taste, or reason,
He vents-and vends-his balderdash,
Of which one-half is veriest trash,
The other vilest treason.
THE LINE OF BEAUTY.

OVER THE BORDER.
MR. GLADSTONE is making a good thing out of his
visit to Midlothian. Besides the mauds, plaids, rugs,
tweed suits, table-covers,! albums, and caskets which
have been duly recorded in the daily papers, number-
less other articles, chiefly of a domestio and useful
character, have been presented to him, but, most un.
accountably, without finding a chronicler.
The following may be relied on as a tolerably accurate
list of the many additional gifts from his friends and
supporters, with which Mr. GLADSTONE will return across
the border richly laden.
Several gallons of the very best Usquebaugh.
A hamper full of Dundee Marmalade, each pot authen-
ticated with the signature of “E. JENKINS, M.P."
Finnan Haddies enough to supply the family break-
fast-table until the meeting of Parliament.
Bannocks, oatcakes, scones, shortbread, and other
trophies of the Land o' Cakes in reckless profusion.
Potted grouse, muir-fowl, ptarmigan, and capercailzie.
Brose, cockaleekie, haggis, and collops, in tins.
A dozen sacks of best rough-ground Scotch oatmeal
(for porridge).
“A peck o' maut" for WILLIE to brew.
Boxes of kippered salmon.
A set of bagpipes beautifully mounted in electro-plate.
A Scotch cap..
A complete Highlander's suit.
Cairngorm brooches, buttons, sleeve-links, and studs
to ditto.
Several Scotch terriers, Skye terriers, and Dandie
Dinmonts.
A Shetland pony.
A team of Clydesdales.
Photographs of BURNS's birthplace, farm, monument,
pipe, and punch-bowl; a lock of ADAM SMITH's wig;
DOGALD STEWART's umbrella ; the Ettrick Shepherd's
crook ; and the original covers of the first number of the
Edinburgh Review
Various editions of The Heart of Midlothian, appro-
priately bound in boards enamelled with all the Scotch
tartans-and,
Last, but not least, a tireless set of Scotch ears, and
a countless number of Scotch hearts.

numerous specimens of human skulls, neatly mounted and fitted up
as cigar-cases and tobacco-holders. In the former character, the
cranium is pierced with holes, through which the cigars stand out,
"like quills upon the fretful porcupine." We know nothing of the
locus a quo of these ghastly relics of mortality. Probably they may
be Zulu crania-war-trophies brought back by some of our young
bloods, fresh from South-African warfare, and with some taint of

Fan-are fond of turning the heads of their slaughtered enemies to
account as ornaments and symbols of prowess, if not as cigar-boxes.
But this appropriation of foemen's skulls to purposes at once of use
and ornament among ourselves, marks a distinct move in civilisation,
and establishes another tie of fellow-feeling and common usage
between us and our savage dependencies.
Considering the space filled by "the weed” in what some circles
are in the habit of calling their minds," it may be thought that to
employ brain-pans as cigar-cases and tobacco-holders, is the most
natural use for them, and that in fact it is rather an honour than

CHAPTER I.
Prefatory Remarks-Existing Instructors, Probabilities-Inquiries
-To be continued in our next.
In a recent most friendly notice of the Personal Reminiscences
of the A. D. C., Cambridge, the Saturday Reviewer makes a sug-
gestion as to a modus operandi for a University Dramatic Lecturer,
which has seemed to be eminently worthy of amplification. To this
logical and fair development, I now address myself in the few
papers I shall have the honour to lay before the public, which is
already interesting itself in the encouragement of a School of
Dramatic Art, to be on the same platform, at least, with the Schools
of Painting and Music.
Where there's a will there's a way, and where there's a want
there's safe to be a supply.
There is a growing demand for a School of Dramatic Art, or
rather for a College within a University, to be called “The Mac-
ready,” “The Kemble," "The Kean," or " The Phelps," as the most
modern of the Colleges in Oxford is called “The Keble”-to which,
by the way, one Irish gentleman, hearing another call it " The Kable
College,'' sent his son, in order to prepare him for a post, a telegraph
post in the United Atlantic Cable Co.
If a College could not at first be obtained, a Professorship of the
Dramatic Art might be instituted at Cambridge, where the stage of
the A. D. C. (or Amateur Dramatic Club) already offers admirable
facilities.
Let a few energetic patrons of the Drama subscribe to endow a
Professorship and a Scholarship.
Who would be the first Professor ?
On looking over the Era, I find three advertisements about in-

HOW OUR COUNTRY COUSIN WILL SPEND THE WEEK
IN LONDON.
1. He will come up to London to see the Cattle Show.
2. He will walk about the streets smoking a cigar, wearing a pot-
hat, and dressed in a suit of tweed dittos.
3. He will lunch at the grill-rooms in Piccadilly and the Strand.
4. He will be seen in great force at all the Refreshment-Bars.
5. He will be found (if very new to Town) in the “Chamber of
| Horrors" at Madame TUSSAUD's, and near the wonderful diyer who
breathes under water at the Polytechnic.
6. He will liberally patronise Hansom-cabs and omnibus knife-
boards.
7. If the frost continues, he will be seen in skates on the ice in
St. James's Park and Kensington Gardens.
8. He will visit the Crystal Palace and the Westminster Aquarium,
and find greater amusement in the feats of the acrobats than in the
wonders of Nature or Art.
9. He will dine at a table d'hôte where he can get four courses,

Of such portentous stretch,
As e'en the wearer of the seven-league boots

With one who can a nimble compass fetch,
Puck-like, in forty columns, from the Turk
To hypothec, from BEACONSFIELD's black work
In three distracted continents, unto
The small Midlothian mischiefs of BUCCLEUCH?
The swift tumultuous torrent,
To Tories and tired editors abhorrent,
Flows on like Phlegethon, a fiery flood
Of vocal lava, scathing, as it flows,
All foes,
Yet lucent as the wells of King BLADUD.
How should one hope,
By use of simile or sounding trope,
With such a stream descriptively to cope ?
Lodore's loud water-floods, the brook of TENNYSON,
Niagara, an angry woman's tongue,
An Irish mendicant's ironic benison,
And all similitudes e'er said or sung
Suggestive of tumultuous, never stopping,

Wakes in the solid Saxon vague mistrust.
Dullards who pin their faith to Dryasdust,
Cold hearts that shiver at zeal's fervent rush,
Cynics who brand all earnestness as gush,
Who look on prineiples as pilots risky,
Think right and justice things that, like neat whiskey,

Sound wisdom spouts not column upon column,
Like ever-squirting Tritons in a fountain,
But talks précis or epigram-like us.

Of vapid though exuberant verbosity,
Inspired by sophistry and animosity !
But ear-witched millions at the grumblers laugh,
Satire itself must marvel though it chaff,
And sober judgment, while it well might wish
The rich rhetoric dish
Were quintessentialised to smaller compass,
Yet, midst all party and polemic rumpus,
Sees in the old man eloquent who bears
Blithely the burden of his seventy years
A true Colossus, firmly poised and bold,
The light of principle to hoist and hold
Amidst time-serving veerings and vagaries,
And, like the Sun-God of the Rhodian Chares,
While a world's wonder to the common view,
A useful beacon too.

UNIVERSITY OF LONDON. — A development of the above
"PICTURE LESSONS IN NATURAL HISTORY." Educational Institute, but possessing the power of granting degrees.
The degree of “Bachelor" is given to anyone who is not wedded to
a subject.
VÄUDEVILLE THEATRE.-In the Strand. Celebrated for its
JAMES's powder, its THORNE, and its Two Roses. For nearly five years
it floated on Our Buoys, a sea-piece supplied by Mr. BYRON. During
that time, whenever you visited the theatre, there were the Buoys
and there was the Flote. Mr. JAMES — familiarly known as
“JIMMY”-and Mr. THORNE, represented the “Jimmini” in the
Theatrical Zodiac — or the Brandy and Zodi-ac. The name of
the theatre is a trouble to Cabmen, who call it the “ Wodevil,” the
“Wodyweal,” or the “ Vordyveal" — with generally an extra
charge. “Fees” are not forbidden at this theatre, but the visitor
can give what he likes, or doesn't like, and so the instance is only
"fee-nominal."

Hence the name-Valks-all Bridge.

CLASS
RULES FOR RELIEVING DISTRESS WITH
DISCRIMINATION.
(By a Discreet Alms-giver.)
1. NEVER give away a penny indiscriminately. If a
beggar tells you he is starving, order him to come to you
the next day. If he makes his appearance, it is a proof
of the falsehood of his statement. If it had been true,
he would have died during the night.
2. If a beggar asks you for money to pay for a lodg-
ing, give him or her into custody. The Police-cells are
always available for such cases.
3. If you are implored to give a letter of introduction
to a Hospital, refuse the request, unless the applicant
can produce two medical certificates.
4. If a woman, with a child or children, asks you for
bread, give her in charge. You may be sure that the
children are hired, and that the woman has a hot dinner
waiting for her at home.
5. If a flower-girl asks you to buy her violets at a
penny a bunch, have nothing to say to her. Her stock,
in all probability, has been dishonestly come by.
6. If a workman, whom you have known in better
times, hints that a few shillings would save his family
and himself from the workhouse, decline, of course;
but do not miss the opportunity of pointing out the con-
nection of his present poverty with past excesses in eating
and drinking.
7. If any one asks you for anything, under any circum-
stances, before you entertain the application, require
1. Certificate of Birth.
2. Certificate of Vaccination, and parents' marriage.
3. Certificates of attendance at Board or Denomina-
tional School, and of grade passed in.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

BEGGARY AND THRIFT.
A WAG has suggested that the word “Mendicant"
might be held to convey the secondary sense, "Mend I
can't.” An exception to this view of mendicancy appears
to have had currency in a case reported from Torquay,
and entitled “A Beggar with a Banking Account."
A Mr. HENRY COATES, "who said he came from London,"
was summoned before the local police-court, charged
with begging :-
" Constable PHILLIPS saw the defendant going from house
to house begging, and secreted himself in a house the prisoner
would call at in the course of his round. When the prisoner
knocked at the door, the constable answered, and prisoner asked
for assistance, saying he was a distressed tradesman. The
policeman took him into custody, and on searching him found
some money and an acknowledgment of a deposit in the Post
Office Savings Bank. Prisoner was sentenced to seven days' hard
labour."
Is it not more than questionable if Mr. COATES, though
a beggar on system, a deliberate beggar, a beggar dis-
tinctly and pre-eminently professional, and therefore
obligatorily dealt with for mendicancy according to law,
can be regarded as one of those mendicants who cannot
mend? The main objection to mendicancy is that it
implies improvidence; but this is a crime that can hardly
be charged on a beggar who puts by money, and owns a
deposit in a Post Office Savings Bank. Arrest and impri-
sonment have closed for the present Mr. COATES's career;
but had he gone on begging and saving, who knows but
| that in time he might have succeeded in 'amassing a
decent independence, or a sum sufficient to enable him
to start in business. There is little chance that the
House of Correction will do much towards correcting this
mendicant. He will probably continue begging and
saving, and risk occasional imprisonment in order to
keep himself permanently out of the workhouse.

From peg-top time. Spread-eagling there

Your exhibition; startling vigour

And to achieve the grand success
Of marvellous long-windedness.
But you 're on slippery ground, sweet WILL,
And have one fault, you can't keep still.
For me, though you may think it tame,
I much prefer the waiting game;

But fitter for our time of life.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ORCHESTRA
A PSALM OF LIFE AT SIXTY.
What the Heart of the Old Man said to the
Genial Gusher at Christmas Time,
TELL me not in Christmas Numbers
Life is but a gourmet's dream!
Sure your sense is dead or slumbers:
Peptics are not what they seem.
Life is serious ! Life is solemn!
And good grub is not its goal:
Menu-making by the column
Helps not the dyspeptic soul.
Not delight from cates to borrow
Is the aim of prudent will,
But to eat so that to-morrow
Finds us not exceeding ill.
Feeds are long and health is fleeting ;
And old stomachs, once so strong,
Find that indiscriminate eating
Very quickly puts them wrong.
In the banquet's dainty battle,
At the table's toothsome strife,
Feed not like dumb hungry cattle,
Wield a cautious fork and knife!
Trust no menu, howe'er pleasant;
Nightmare-Nemesis is dread;
Swig and swallow like a peasant,
You'll repent it when in bed !
Memories of big feeds remind us
Christmas pudding peace can slay;
Touch it, and next morn shall find us
Indigestion's helpless prey.
Pudding that perhaps another,
Light of heart and bright of brain,
Some strong-stomached younger brother,
Eating, sends his plate again.
Let us then beware high feeding,
Or the love of luscious cate,
Still abstaining, ne'er exceeding,
Learn to dodge dyspeptic fate!

PEACE and Goodwill ? Ironio sound,
The watchword of the season,
Whilst trumpets sound and wars abound,
And riot palsies reason.
Poor Dame Europa! Creaking locks
And cracking hinges fright her;
The guarding of Pandora's box
Were cheerier task and lighter.
“ 'Tis Sovereigns and Statesmen rule,"
Our Cynic Swaggerer vaunted; i
In Europe's School this bitter Yule
That bund may well be daunted.
Watching the chaos dark and drear,
The jester murmurs sadly,
“ If thus they rule the world, 'tis clear
They rule it very badly!”
With Russian knout and Teuton gag
Crown's Power sets bad examples ;
Assassin's steel against the heel
Whose iron mercy tramples.
'Tis vain! Be't CZAR, Drill-Sergeant POPE,
For all 'tis sheer insanity
By steel and rope, from light and hope,
To bar out poor humanity.
And England, where the bondsman's star
Once Þlazed, but now burns dimmer,
England that fanned, in peace or war,
Poor Freedom's feeblest glimmer, -
Is the fit on thee? Thou shake hands
With the crass combination
Of those who see in bonds and bands
Lost Order's sole salvation !
This war of selfish interests
And rights antagonistic
Threats thy new creed with sterner tests
Than shouts or pleas sophistic.
The flatterer hath thine ear to-day,
To sober Wisdom's sorrow;
But to the older, better way
Thou 'lt turn-we trust-to-morrow.
Order is good; good is increase
Of righteous reigning power;
But sword-sway robs the world of peace,
And cancels Freedom's dower.
It can not hold ! Best bide the rule
Of patient right and reason,
Trust that, and Europe's next fair Yule
Will be a gladder season.
For all within seems wrathful din,
Safe progress at a sad lock ;
In vain she thrusts her blade to aid
The power of Order's padlock.
Insurgent forces jar and clash
All armed suppression mocking,
Cold tyranny, rebellion rash,
In ceaseless conflict shocking.

Another eminent University dignitary is the High Steward. His

He is generally chosen for his skill in smoothing down the Dons in a
difficulty, and his office is called, from the peculiar style of his elocu-
tion, the “Buttery." It would be invidious to designate any one
member of the Theatrical Profession for this important appointment,
which would be admirably well filled by so many among them.
The duties of the High Steward are-
First,— Of course never to be a Low Steward.
Secondly,-Once a year, when game is in, to make a High Stew.
Failing this last, he resigns his office; accomplishing this, he re-signs
the contract for the next year.
Thirdly,- He has during the summer to personally examine the

him as the H’ice Steward.

THE National Pudding all parties protest!
By themselves is best planned, and compounded the best,
And each eager spoon-wielder will stoutly aver
All would turn out quite well had himself but a stir
At the glorious Plum-Pudding of England,
Old England's unequalled Plum-Pudding !
The Stirrers-in-Chief, who've their spoons in the pan,
Have been stirring away on their own special plan
For a tidy long time, and triumphantly say
That no Season has shown, for this many a day,
Such a splendid Plum-Pudding for England,
Such a genuine English Plum-Pudding!
Says the clever Chief-Cook, “Here are plums, if you please ;
Join BULL, like Jack Horner, loves whoppers like these.
We will pour in the spirit, we won't spare the spice,
And we'll mix it, and stir it, and make it all nice,
This peerless Plum-Pudding for England,
This perfect Old English Plum-Pudding !""
And his mates back their Chef, and they stir and they shout,
“Leave the Pudding to us-we know what we're about;
Whilst those fellows-pooh! poohl they would spare, they would
pinch,
And from spicing they'd shrink, and from stirring they'd finch,
And so spoil the Plum-Pudding of England,
The old-fashioned English Plum-Pudding!”.
But their rivals-oh, wildly each one waves his spoon,
And they cry, “You must call us to stir, and right soon.
For your Chef is a duffer, his cooking a dodge,
Mere messing and muddling to stickjaw and stodge
Of the fine old Plum-Pudding of England,
The famous old English Plum-Pudding!”
And there's one with a far bigger spoon than the rest,
Who, they say, both at mixing and stirring is best;
Prime stuff he turns out, made with taste and with care,
Pudding wholesome as toothsome, or so they declare,
Who'd have him stir the Pudding of England,
The wondrous old English Plum-Pudding!
Well, we know the old Saw about too many cooks ;
But a Saw is not always so sage as it looks;
And a Pudding so big as JOHN BULL's may require
All the hands and the spoons that toil on and ne'er tire
Of stirring the Pudding of England,
The mighty old English Plum-Pudding!
The proof of the Pudding's in eating, they say ;
And JOHN BULL, who must to eat it has likewise to pay ;
And so, at this season, let's wish them success,
And hope that among them they won't make a mess
Of the rare old Plum-Pudding of England,
The old English Christmas Plum-Pudding!

good wishes of the season.
