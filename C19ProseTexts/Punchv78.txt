SCENE- The Thames out Henley way. Mr. Punch discovered lazily lolling in a Skiff' moored among the reeds. Toby dutifully
imitating his Master in uncompromising dolce far niente. To them enter hastily, and fresh from London, the FIRST LORD of the
TREASURY.
Premier. Ah! found you at last, my dear Punch! Whoof! I wired you. Why didn't you answer ?
Punch. Telegrams never come here, where I loll, like the mighty God Pan, Sir,
“Down in the reeds by the river.”
Premier.
Advice, many-counselled ULYSSES—-
Punch (yawning). Rather not turn on that tap in a Lotos-land lovely as this is.
Still if it must be, it must. Only first try another potation.
[Passes tankard.
Premier. Thanks ! I must catch the next train up to London; and so-
Punch.
Botheration !
No House to-night! Take it easy!
Premier.
You 're lazy, --yet cute as a Q.C.
I've run down to seek your advice ; I am sure you will give it in nuce.
Punch. Palaver in June-on the river! By Phoebus, the thing lacks congruity !
Premier. Sir, in evading the point, you ’re displaying a Turk's ingenuity.
Punch. Terrible wriggler, the Ottoman ; many more shifts than old Merlin.
Wonder if joint-stock coercion will bring him to book now at Berlin ?
Premier. That is just one of the points that I wanted-
Punch.
By Jove, look at Toby! A
Tidy cool band is that tyke; he will never invite hydrophobia.
Twig him there stretched on his back! 'Tis a capital antiphlogistic.
Premier. Yes, but the Porte-
Punch.
À propos, try the Claret Cup. Dreamily mystic
That haze on the--dickens, man! don't jump like that! This is not a Dutch lugger.
Seen Anne-Mie, by the way?
Premier.
Punch.
I 'll just shift this cushion. That's snugger!
BEERSMAN 's not bad, I assure you.
Premier.
Well-passing such topics extraneous—
What do you think of our Note?
Punch.
The identic and hum-simultaneous ?
No.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Hope it may prove the right key note of Harmony. Ah! if the Powers
Their Plenipos mustered down here, 'midst the reeds and forget-me-not flowers,
I'd settle the "three points" like winking.
Premier.
Well, first for the Turco-Greek frontier-
Punch. This is not the " Answärtige Amt.” Better far in a skiff or a punt bere,
To—ah! what a glorious sunset! By Phæbus, it's really magnificent !
Premier. Punce, if I but had my
will-
l'unch.
I much fear I should be in a jiffy sent
Straight to that dull Wilhelmstrasse,—in June! My objection 's emphatic.
Much nicer to watch my float bobbing than listen to jaw diplomatic.
Premier (glumly). Your counsel is commonly ready, but —
Punch (reassuringly).
Pshaw! my sweet WILLIAM, don't hurry!
And when did your Punchius fail you? What is it?
Premier (deprecatingly).
I fear I'm a worry.
But as to Coercion-Obstruction-Rad Hobbies—bad Ottoman habits—
SIR BARTLE and BRADLAUGH-Scotch bigots—hot HARCOURT—the Hares and the Rabbits-
That task for a modern God Terminus, Thessaly way—and those Tories,
Who swear in one breath we're both stealing and turning our backs on their glories, –
Why really, my cool-puffing Purch, there are so many points, that--
Punch.
No doubt of it.
A pretty tight fit, Sir, all round; but, my WILLIAM, you know the way out of it.
Principle, patience, and pluck. Oh come, come, my stout veteran, verily,
Spite of your seventy summers, you seem to have started right merrily.
Peg away. Puzzled ? Pooh! pooh !-you 're so modest.
Premier.
Of course your approval,
In principle, lightens the load, but 'twould hasten the burden's removal
If hints as to details-
Punch (rousing himself).
Here goes then! A batch of new brooms, you 're expected
To sweep very clean, and already a good deal of dirt you 've detected ;
But would you the Padishah squeeze without putting the Powers at jangles—
Get Tory intrigue out of hobbles, and Tory finance out of tangles-
And scumfish the hosts of O'Donnell, and drive half the crotchets to Sheitan,
And—do all the other stiff jobs that the Pigmies expect from a Titan-
You may, it is true, need a tip" or two. Take them, in bulk and in brightuess,
Sweetness and Light quintessentialised, Art without queerness or "quite-ness,"
Portable pithy omniscience, encyclopedian wisdom,
Smartness unspoiled by the taint of the Cockney Cad's realm of Cheap Fizz-dom ;
Statesmanship's true Vade Mecum, Time's chronicle wrought with conciseness,
And writ in a manner most trenchant, a style that, for terseness and niceness,
Would take the shine out of THUCYDIDES, stump smart MACAULAY, or bowl HUME,
Take-need I mention the Masterpiece ?-take Punch's
Seventy-Eightly Volume !

TÉLBIN, which, gorgeous in brilliancy and colour, is
quite a cheering sight in this dull, foggy, unpoetic
Christmas, which has been anything but " All right up
to now!"
In the “Comic Scenes" — so called, to distinguish
them from the Serious Scenes of the Opening—there is
one great novelty-a Clown, with a moustache. I thought
at first it was "a trick; but no—there it remained
all the evening; and unless some new Transformation
has occurred before these lines appear, there will be that
moustache on that Clown's lip. "Ah!” as Mr. H. P.
STEPHENS says in his topical Song, “What are we
coming to next?”. A Clown in moustachios! Why,
he'll come on with whiskers, and then without his
paint; and then without his motley! And then-a Pan-
tomime, in plain clothes, under the patronage of “the
Church and Stage Guild,” with a Ballet of Colonial
Bishops, in short skirts, and a Rural Dean, lent for the
run by the Pastoral Aid Society, to appear as the Good

evidently been inspired by the famous adventures of
Miss Alice in Wonderland. Mr. ALFRED REED as a

being an exact reproduction of one of those startling
living bogies which were at once the delight and terror
of our childhood when we snatched a fearful joy in
undoing the wire hook that kept down the lid of the box.
Mr. ALFRED BISHOP is inimitable as the Beadle out of a
Punch Show, whose poor wooden head has been so be-
laboured that he cannot recall the name of the villain
who stood at a first-floor window and committed such
diabolical atrocities as might well attract the attention
of Mr. GLADSTONE. Mr. CORNEY GRAIN is a Prince off
a Twelfth-cake, which, to a logical-minded critic like
myself, is a mistake, inasmuch as "such a personage is
not properly in the Land of Toys.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ONLY A PENNY A-PIECE!
Mr. Punch is writing on the Fortieth Anniversary of
the introduction of Penny Postage.
" In the year which immediately preceded its introduction,
the total number of postal deliveries in the United Kingdom
was 82,563,000. Last year the number reached the vast total
of 1,536,790,000, or an increase of about eighteenfold.”
Let our readers consider all that this implies-of transac-
tions facilitated, business quickened, anxieties lightened,
ideas exchanged, cords of love drawn closer, all over the
world.
ROWLAND HILL never had his official due, though the
respect and reverence of his countrymen shed on his latter
days the light which official prejudice and narrowness
did all they could to exclude from his earlier years.
Subscriptions are now being raised for a Memorial to
the man to whom England owes this great boon.
Sir F. W. TRUSCOTT, Lord Mayor, as active promoter
of this Memorial, writes to urge the appeal, and Punch
is glad to echo his urging, -
“Sir RowLAND Hill has recently died, and a grateful nation
has accorded him burial in its greatest historical shrine-West-
minster Abbey. But such gratitude, it has been thought, should
not stop here, and some lasting Memorial in a beneficent shape
should, it is considered, mark the public sense of Sir ROWLAND'S
vast work. The Mansion House Committee, in whose name and
at whose request I am writing, feel that this object can most
usefully be achieved by the foundation of a Benevolent Fund for
the succour of aged and distressed Post Office employés through-
out the Kingdom and their widows and orphans. In proof of the
necessity of such a fund, I may mention à few facts which may
not be generally known.”
Only let the recognition of ROWLAND HILL's good
work be as wide as its benefit; only let everyone
in the kingdom lay his one stamp on the grave of him
to whom they owe that stamp and all its conveniences,
and the LORD Mayor tells us £130,000 would be realised
for an object, good in itself, and a tribute to the good
work of a good man.
It will be sad, as strange, if such an appeal do not
receive an answer as world-wide as the blessing of
ROWLAND HILL's own fruitful and beneficent reform.

THE PLAGUE OF PARROTS.
(Being a Protest from a Plain Person against the Abuse
of Epigram.)
YOUR epigram, doubtless, is all very fine,
But I fancy 'tis often more dazzle than shine;
And to boobies who flounder in Sophistry's bog,
A Will o' the Wisp may prove worse than a fog.
Yet let Wit have its due; close-packed truth plus a
point
Makes a finger-post fair for a world out of joint;
And portable wisdom like pemmican food
Is remarkably handy-so long as it's good.
But, alas ! for Wit's work, when its cunningest phrases
Are caught by the Parrots! Of all modern crazes
The craze for mere catchwords is sure the most teasing ;
When, dinned in our ears with persistence unpleasing,
They fall on the soul with as ghastly a shock,
As the ten-thousandth grinding of “Grandfather's
Clock."
A plague on all Parrots! With DICKENS I'd say,
They're more mischievous fowls than your right birds
The latter, perhaps, one may hope to escape,
But your genuine Parrot wears Protean shape,
Whose ubiquitous presence no man may avoid,
Mr. Punch, for long months I've been irked and
annoyed
By a vile piece of parrotry, scarce food for laughter-
" An Englishman first, and a Party-man after !!”
I declare, Şir, that phrase, none too sage at the best,
Has ruffled my temper and broken my rest,
Till, like some absurd piece of Pinafore patter,
The sound of it drives me as mad as a hatter.
'Tis a vile phrase-of-all-work to cover gross greeds,
To excuse sheer assumptions and mask dirty deeds-
'Tis a jibe ever handy to hurl at the wretch
Who's unable the big name of “ Briton" to stretch
Till it's found co-extensive with ethics' whole code-
Which, if I can manage, dear Punch, I'll be blowed.

Considering that balloons defy steerage, and that every hundred
yards they go up the temperature goes down, while there will be no
hard hauling and continuous movement, as with sledging-parties,
to keep the blood in circulation, we don't envy the Arctic aëronauts.
Mr. COXWELL thinks a Captive Balloon had better be tried first,
“to get a view of the icebergs ahead.". Punch entirely agrees with
him, though he can see icebergs enough ahead without any balloons.
At any rate, if a Captive Balloon is to be used, don't let it be
anchored by a Cheyne. Iron, we know, is apt to snap under sudden
changes of temperature, and is always dangerous to handle in high
latitudes.
The LORD MAYOR was very polite, and full of good wishes. Of
course he knew nothing about the Arctic, and nothing about balloon-
ing, but he was always glad to receive deputations of eminent and
scientific men, and he would be delighted to lend the Mansion House
for a public meeting. “No one could object to the project being
thoroughly threshed out." No one-except Captain CHEYNE, who
wants the project “warmly taken up”-not thoroughly “thrashed
out,” as we fancy it is pretty certain to be by any jury of scientific
citizens.
“No doubt,” added the LORD MAYOR, if Commander CHEYNE'S
plans met with approval, he would soon receive the
means of carry-
ing them out." ** Great virtue in an 'if,'” says Touchstone. The
only way in which Punch could wish to see this wild scheme

may be supposed capable of linking on to him, would be by its being,
once for all, carried out of the pale of serious discussion, and
decently buried among other fantastic projects, in the Limbo-land
of Laputa.
That is its ultimate destiny. Better it should be reached without

QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED.
CAB OWNERS ON CAB ACCIDENTS.
(On the Frontier-between Science and Misgiving.)
This island is one of the Society Islands-though a long way from
the others. Great Britain is an island of societies, some reasonable,
others ridiculous. Success to a Social Alliance with something like
a sensible purpose-the Streets Accident Prevention Society. A
meeting of the society above-named
was waited upon a few days ago,
at their offices in Bishopsgate, by a deputation representing the
London Cab Proprietors. Precautions for the protection of life and
limb must, of course, involve expense. For example, for it to
compel cabs to carry lights at night would cost something.
Of course it was not the mere cost of providing lamps that the cab
proprietors objected to. "The cab-interest,” said a Mr. MERRY,
objected to cabs being selected above all other vehicles for the invi-
dious distinction of being obliged to carry lights." This, however,
he was told the Society did not press for. It desired lights to be
obligatory on all vehicles at nights, “down to a costermonger's
barrow." But the cab interest had further arguments to urge against
cab-lights.
AFCHANIS
“Mr. KING, another cab proprietor, said it was a question whether lights
on cabs at (night did not actually cause accidents, as the "hansons, which
carried lights, caused more accidents than the four-wheelers, which did not as
a rule carry lights."
Mr. KING did not argue that cab-lights attract silly people as
candle-lights do moths, or assist perverse simpletons to get into
the way of cabs on purpose. Waiving the connection of cab-lights
with cab accidents in the way of cause and effect, he went on to

character for himself.

pay the fashionable prices. Do they go out of love of the Drama ?
Not a bit. They go to be seen, and to see, and to say they've been.
They go the Stalls of the fashionable theatres as they will go to
the Stalls at the Italian Opera in the season. Do they care one whit
more for Music than they do for the Drama? No. Poor Pater-
familias with stalls at ten shillings a-piece, can't get through his one
evening's entertainment much under a five-pound note, and
though his family may have the exquisite pleasure of getting a
glimpse of Royalty in a box, of nodding to a titled club acquaintance
-whom young CRUTCH will proudly point out to his sisters,-of
meeting the DE PONSONBY SMITHS, of seeing the
fashionable beauties,
and hearing (probably in whispers during the performance) the
fashionable scandals, yet poor Paterfamilias himself will not have
experienced such intellectual pleasure as will recompense him in
any degree for his outlay, nor will it strike him that his children
have been morally improved by the visit.
The Manager will probably say that one success at these prices
will recoup him for any previous losses, and that as long as the
public will pay his charges, so long is he justified in making them.
The public, however, will not go on paying his charges. A portion
of the public may do so, whose pockets are not inconvenienced by
having to pay dearly for luxuries; but even these will find the
prices high for bric-à-brac and realistic properties, and when they
withdraw the attraction of their fashionable presence, then the
snobs, who only went for the sake of the nobs, will go too, and
your stalls, on which you depended, will be empty-empty, as the
majority of their former occupants, -and then what have you to
look to ? A Pit ? No. That you chased away. A Dress Circle ?
No. That you made expensive and unfashionable? A Gallery ?
Oh, dear, no, you never played to a Gallery. Private Boxes? Yes
- for friends; and Upper Circle for “orders."
The Manager will reply, that a successful piece will bring them all
back again. Not all. Your former patrons will be chary of return-
ing; and that public, which you have disregarded and which you
have driven away by your high prices, will have found some other
amusement, will have lost what taste it had for the Drama, and,
feeling no sort of interest in your success or failure, will leave you
and your theatres to take care of themselves, to sink or swim, as

will be the interest or the wish of our neighbours to engage us
in a struggle, or that the struggle, if it came, would be a struggle
unto death.
This ushered in an unusually pointless reply by Lord
BEACONSFIELD-sans phrase, strange to say, but for a
peroration gravely informing the world that the issue of
the Liverpool election is nothing less than the dismem-
berment of the United Kingdom. (Which will be news
to most of us.) A rattling rejoinder by the Duke of
ARGYLL turned mainly on the alleged hanging of Af-
ghans by General ROBERTS for no other crime than
defending their country (as to which startling charge
Punch and England suspend their judgment till they
hear what General ROBERTS has to say to it).
The Duke blew up Sir HENRY RAWLINSON-Chairman
of Foreign Relations in the Council of India-for pub-
lishing a paper recommending, inter alia, the transfer
of Herat to Persia, and the guaranteeing of Persia
against Russia; and Lord LYTTON, or some one in his
confidence,
or someone in the confidence of the Home
Government--(rather vague this, your Grace)—for com-
munieating to the Daily News a secret telegram from
the Government, directing another appeal to SHERE ALI
before proceeding to war. This drew a sharp counter
from Lord CRANBROOK, in the course of which he said
the Duke had forfeited his title as a statesman by im-
pugning the conduct of the Governor-General without
having the facts before him. This second stage of the
Lords' debate was as lively as the first had been dull.

CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and Mr. PLUNKET met the Home-Rulers'
charge with a firm front, and a bristling array of points, in proof that Govern-
ment had done their best-and that their best was as good as it could be.
As at present informed, Punch is bound to say they seem to make good their
case.
Of course there were a few passages of shillelagh-slogging between Messrs.
LEWIS and O'CONNOR POWER, and PLUNKET and O'DONNELL, à propos of a very
unworthy subject of quarrel, Mr. PARNELL, his denunciation of all channels
for distribution of Irish relief but his own, and his exultation over a calamity
that helped forward his agitation. Let Mr. O'DONNELL protest never so
loudly, all Mr. PARNELL has done and is doing, since the Irish distress set in,
only proves him capable of the worst that Mr. PLUNKET attributed to him.
If English hearts feel it hard not to be hard against Ireland, Ireland may
thank CHARLES STUART PARNELL.

AN APPEAL TO JOHN BULL'S IMAGINATION.
“Mr. GLADSTONE has never addressed himself to the imagination of the
British people, only to their interests.”—Débats.
JOHN BULL, you are but a Beotian chap,
Beery and bovine, bashful, blunt, bucolio;
Shackled by moral figments, and the map,
You scarce appreciate Fancy free and frolic.
Her rapt outpourings, which you call clap-trap,
Though couched in language high and hyperbolic,
You ’re apt to flout with foolish indignation ;
In short, dear JOHN, you lack imagination.
But now 'tis time the little that you have
Should be stirred up-I'd rather not say tickled.
Too long you've funked the Conqueror's bloody glaive,
And for pretence of right and justice stickled :
Prosy punctilio by which the Slav
Will ne'er be, as he should be, soundly pickled.
Kick out your fogeyish monitor, Morality,
And try a little loose-laced Ideality!
Imagine, John, your simple, solid self
A sort of Anglo-Saxon ALEXANDER,
Lord o' the world, supreme in power and pelf,
Of all good mundane markets sole commander !
“Imagination is a tricksy elf,
And you mistrust her"?—Don't be such a gander!
If you don't shout your claims in language strident,
You might as well go pawn BRITANNIA's trident.
There's hardly any station one can name,
In any latitude with shore or sea to it,
But is important to your world-wide game,
Forming, if not your gate, at least a key to it.
Each key's essential to your power and fame-
A plain truth, though the world may not agree to it,
Until of keys you 're getting such a stock,
The world must dread a general dead-lock.
Take any given spot. You're planted there,
Or may, or can, or will be, some fine day;
In all roads leading thither you must share :
You might, could, should, would wish to pass that way.
For all contingencies you must prepare;.
And so, should other peoples dare to stray
Across, or near, or round about such places,
Of course you must smash those intrusive races.
A glorious prospect, JOHN! Does it not fire
A
Your patriotic and imperial feelings?
What! " Seems to involve some things of which you tire,
Insolent snatchings and insidious stealings”?
Pooh-pooh! You're civilised, and don't require
High moral sanction for despotic dealings;
And if on other races you make ravages,
It matters little—they are mostly savages.
Don't grovel, John, in sentimental slime,
Spread o'er low flats by those who fain would humble
Your proper pride. You are supreme, sublime,
And not a poor parochial village Bumble.

A PRACTICAL MAN AND NO JOKER.
MR. Punch, SIR,
As the practical man of the nineteenth century,
I address myself to you. After two years' hard work the
Committee sitting upon the surviving. Thunderer gun
have managed to burst it. The realisation of their plans
has been a matter of the deepest congratulation to all
concerned. I share in the feeling of general satisfaction.
But, Sir, we surely ought not to stop here. Now that
it has been proved that a double charge will burst the
biggest of our naval ordnance, should we not test other
things in a similar fashion ? To explain what I mean,
I give you a few suggestions out of my note-book.
List of THINGS THAT WANT SETTLING.
St. Paul's Cathedral.-It has been asserted that the
singing of the Charity Children in the Dome threatens
to endanger the stability of that portion of Sir CHRISTO-
PHER WREN's monument. Would it not be as well
to get up a dozen of our Woolwich Infants into the
Whispering Gallery, and fire them simultaneously to see
the effect.
The Crystal Palace.--It has been rumoured, though
the report has been denied, that the structure requires
renewing in all its main lines. Under these circumstances
would it not be as well to hold the Easter Volunteer
Review on the roof to see how much of the glass and
iron would be broken?
The British Museum. For many years the Reading-
Room has been closed at dusk for fear of fire. It is
opened now in the evenings, thanks to the adoption of
the electric light. Would it not be as well to test the
indestructibility of the apartment by lighting a bon-
fire in the centre, of a pile of all the now useless dupli-
cates in the Library, moistened with, say, two-hundred
gallons of paraffine.
The Thames Tunnel.-It is asserted that if a hole were
bored through the roof to the river the water would
certainly enter and destroy the passage. Would it not
be as well to test the assertion by making the necessary
boring?
When these very interesting and useful experiments
have been carried out, I will send you a score of others

NEXT INVENTION.
(LEAP, YEAR.)
(By Prophetic Cable.)
New York, Monday,
It is rumoured that our talented young
inventor has discovered a wonderful liquid
that will, without doubt, supersede wine,
beer, and other now popular drinks. Until
the patents have been secured in the four
quarters of the globe the secret of the
manufacture will not be divulged. It is
whispered, however, that water will form
one of the principal ingredients. A com-
pany, has been formed, entitled “The
Original Beverage Association," and the
100-dollar shares are already quoted at 50
premium.

The new invention is progressing favour-
ably. The Professor has discovered that
sugar can be used with advantage. Several

experts from New York have reported
favourably, and the original 100-dollar
shares of the "0. B. A.' are already in
great request at 2000 dollars.

The Professor is baffled-of course, only
for the moment. Perfect amalgamation of
the elements of the new discovery has not
been, as yet, thoroughly effected. The
shares of the Association are now quoted
at a considerable reduction-100-dollar
shares might have been had this morning
for 50.

Glorious news! Our young Professor is
once more triumphant! He has discovered
that a vegetable substance largely grown
in Asia can be added to his mixture with
great effect. The shares are once more at

“Princerples? Well, these is mine :-

For Lord Lawrence.
"A numerously-attended public meeting was held yesterday
at the Mansion House, the LORD MAYOR presiding, with a
view of considering what steps should be taken for the erection
of a suitable monument to Lord LAWRENCE. The speakers
included Lord Derby, Lord GEORGE HAMILTON, M.P., the
Dean of WESTMINSTER, Mr. Justice STEPHEN, Lord NORTH-

A sensible and cool talk, started by Lord EMLY, about the dis-

Over the Relief of Irish Distress Bill, the question whether the

Surplus Fund, as proposed, or out of the Exchequer, was discussed in
a business-like way, considering the Irish propensity to interpret
the rule, “Help yourselves” in the sense of Put your hand into
somebody else's pocket,” and with a refreshing absence of the
rampant O'Donnelism and Finniganism to which the House-or
rather its walls—had just been treated. In the end, the House
accepted the Bill, without amendment.
The ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S Bankruptcy Law Amendment was
referred to a Select Committee, Sir HENRY JAMES, promising his
valuable help in the shaping of the Bill. Time will show if Sir
JOHN HOLKER's measure is to do anything more effectual for the
cleansing of the Augean stable of Insolvency Law than its prede-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
IMPERIUM ET LIBERTAS!
EMPIRE and Liberty! Two pregnant names,
That mark the hardest crux of history's course;
For how to reconcile the rival claims
Of private freedom and state-ordering force,
The energy that stirs, the law that tames
The spring of Progress, Change's troubled source,
To leave thoughts free, yet restless wills to muzzle,
This is the thinker's plague, the statesman's puzzle.
Freedom is good, and good is righteous rule,
But two most spectral shams their forms that ape,
Monarchs betray, and multitudes befool ;
Blind Licence, masked in Liberty's fair shape,
And Tyranny, with ruthless scourge for tool,
That abject dread doth in the purple drape,
And cowers in mockery of Right Divine,
Over the deep-laid death of Treason's mine.
How sham breeds sham! Here, Empire based on wrong;
There, desperate Licence that makes mook of right:
Absolute rule, which looks so proud and strong,
Seen close, is found a prey to wild affright;
And the masked spirit that sang freedom's song,
And walked in Liberty's fair robe of light,
Shows a foul demon, impotent for good,
In treachery steeped, and red with guiltless blood.
Empire and Liberty! Let satire halt
In her harsh task of baring hidden truth,
At thought of Murder in her secret vault-
Plotter of wholesale slaughter, void of ruth!
Blind and blood-thirsty fury is the fault
Of Revolution in its red raw youth,
But, to devise swift death, in darkness screened,
Asks compound of the coward and the fiend.
Poor Empire! Shaken in its chamber lone
By every shadow on its guarded walls!
Poor Liberty! whose face here shows as one
So foul her firmest friends it most appals !
What hope of reconciliation ? None,
Till from the pair of close-linked shams there falls
“THE UNSEEN WORLD.”
The robe that covers Tyranny's old lie,
The mask that hides thy blindness, Anarchy!

speeches made after the most careful
SPEECHES TO BE FOUGHT SHY OF.
At the dinner of the Associated Chambers of Com-
merce, in reply to the toast of "Success to our Foreign
and Commercial Relations with Foreign countries, and
our Colonies !” the Japanese Ambassador spoke with ex-
cellent sense and taste. Perhaps the most interesting
statement in His Excellency's oration was the announce-
ment with which it was brought to a conclusion. The
Minister, in a deprecatory allusion to his own words as a
“first attempt," declared that as yet, "Speech-making
had not been introduced into Japan." As no doubt the
Ambassador will do his best to supply this omission in
the institutions of Japan, it would be as well to warn
him against certain kinds of speech-making much in
vogue in this country; as, for instance, -
The speech made by an Obstructionist in the House of
Commons, when sense, loyalty, patriotism, and grammar
are sacrificed to violence, the rubbing up of old sores,
and vulgar appeals to national antipathies and sectarian
hatreds.
The speech made by the Friend of the Family at a
wedding, when the early and rather unpleasant antece-
dents of the father of the Bride are apologetically

All very well this, the reader may say, à propos of the
play when presented to the mind's eye with Fanoy
to cast the parts, and Imagination to set the scenes.
But how reconcile this rhapsody with the play as pre-
sented on the Imperial boards, with Miss LITTON to super-
intend the action, and Mr. PERKINS to paint the scenery?
Well, really, Mr. Punch did not think he could have
seen the play through with so little sense of jar between
his fancy and the facts set before him as he did at the
Hu
Imperial last Wednesday. The beautiful Comedy is
beautifully put on the stage, and as well acted as we can
have any hope of seeing it acted in London, failing a
theatrical realisation of Aliena’s notion, that "Mountains
mav be removed with earthquakes, and so encounter."
Meantime, Punch recommends all who want to see As
You Like It, as he likes it, and as they ought to like it,
to take their places at the Imperial. It is an afternoon
theatre, and they can get their pleasure over before dinner,
so that it need not interfere with digestion, or involve
their carrying an ill-digested meal to their stalls-
places, however suited to a fattened ox, eminently unfit
for a well-dined man.
Punch has a great respeet for the critics, and of course
he likes, if possible, to steer his judgment by their com-
passes ; though this is by no means easy when they point
different ways; when, in fact, you have not only to box
the compass, but to consult compasses that box each other.
One critic tells him that the play is too sumptuously
attired and mounted, that the dresses of the foresters in
particular are too gay and bright. Now it seemed to him
that while the Court of the usurping Duke was very
handsomely furnished with Courtiers and Ladies, as well
as terraces and gardens, the Court of his banished brother
in Arden was appropriately arrayed in nothing finer
than serge of hodden grey, autumnal brown, and Ken-
dal or Lincoln green, leather jerkins, and rough leggings
- very fitting for hunters' garb, and not a bit too fine for
their place and purpose. He has, certainly, never seen
a Rosalind so appropriately, modestly, and tastefully
attired, and so much at home in her doublet and hose;
never an Orlando better dressed, as well as of more
youthful figure, bearing, and movement; never
more prettily costumed transformation of Celia into
Aliena.
The complaint of over-splendour of attire, or over-doing
of scenic setting, is the very last he would have expected

Lord DUNRAVEN spoke forcibly on Irish suffering, the lack of
self-dependence, the ready ear given to agitators, the clamour for
help from the State, and the deficiency of private enterprise in
Ireland. There was good sense in all he said about the chafe of
old confiscations and oppressions; the difficulties of Irish landlords
and the unfair measure meted out to them; the inexpediency of
forcing peasant proprietorship; and the probable result of Parnel-
Lian agitation and agrarian Utopias. His sheet-anchor was emi-

probability, his kith and kin ; but in the meantime agitation must
be discouraged, law-abiding folk must be protected and law en-
forced, and that done, Time," The Old Justice," must be waited for
to try and mend all.
This was an uncommonly comprehensive and able summary of

LEADING' IDEAS.
“A man and leader of men.”—Tennyson.
The Sphinx soliloquises :-
“LEADER of men! Mellifluous laureate
Of blameless Kings and of ideal Knights,
Piper of high-pitched patriot lays, dost guess
How 'tis by ear and nose, not hand and heart,
Mankind is led ? Leading is easy work !
To inspire or to enlighten earth's dull drones,
Might task a new Prometheus; nay, to drive
The mulish multitude is Titan's work,
But leading ? Bah! 'tis as the carrot-bunch
Held in advance of donkey's outstretched nose
By the adroiter urchin in a race.
With words we manage men !-well-chosen words,
Vague, but of sounding vastness, fit to fire
Those ruling passions which, aroused, give rule
To the deft píper who can play on them.
Have I not played,-ye gods, have I not played
The stops of Búll's whole gamut up and down,
With firm though most fantastic fingering ?
And,-there's the humour on't !-to fine fixed tunes,
Whose score, in my green youth,—which was not green-
I set before his slow unseeing eyes,
With that frank daring which so dupes the fools,
And so disarms the wise! Commons and Peers,
The Court, the Clubs, the Crowd, cold friends, hot foes,
The Swells, the Cits, the Blues, the Radicals,
The country Squires, aye, all the stiff-necked lot,
From COWEN stout to caustic SALISBURY,
Stoop to my lure and follow in my wake!
By TUBAL-Cain, there is no instrument
On which sure touch and subtle mastery
Can play to such strange issues as man's heart.
Heart ?' The word serves to cover a wild sum
Of eager appetites, to tickle which
Into esurience gives wit a tool
Stronger than armies or exchequers crammed :
'Tis single strength that sways unto its ends
Multiform weakness-greed and vanity,
The itch for domination, and the thirst
For much noise-making in a noise-witched world ;
The larger egoism of land and race,
Stretched but self-centred still, and smartly tricked
In vesture of heroic virtue; fear
That hides with strutting port and swelling speech,
And self-deceptive show of vigilance,
Its inner baseness,—these be dominant chords
TRAIN UP A WIFE," &c.

And in a phrase that voices their dumb-will

Of love that takes so much delight in kicking !

(At the Court Theatre and the Prince of Wales's.)
MR. Wilson BARRETT, Lessee and Manager of the Court Theatre,
is to be congratulated on having produced a really interesting
Five-Act Play, The Old Love and the New, written by an American
dramatist, Mr. BRONSON HOWARD. Mr. ALBERY has adapted it for
the English stage." Each of the first three Acts ends with a telling
dramatic situation. The fourth would be wearisome but for the
admirable acting of Mr. COGHLAN, who carries it through trium-
phantly. The truth seems to be, that the audience is, from first to
last, interested in the hero of the Author's creation, John Stratton,
through Mr. COGHLAN's masterly representation of the character,
but never sympathises with either the Author's or Miss ROSELLE'S
Lilian.

HOW TO BECOME A GRAIN OF THE COL-
LECTIVE WISDOM.
(Notes for the Use of Brand New Candidates, by an Eape
rienced Outsider.)
HAVING selected your Borough or County by digging
at any published list of the constituencies with a pin
with your eyes shut telegraph your resolution to a local
agent, take a Parliamentary ticket, and start for the
next train.
On your way down read Demosthenes, taking care
to fill your mouth with pebbles before starting, and to
miss no opportunity of speaking on every platform you
come to.
Once on the spot buy a new hat. This gives you a
colourable excuse for going to the poll. The latter is
generally only to be found by a voyage of discovery, and
necessitates the employment of a highly-trained crew,
scientific apparatus, an experienced commander with a
balloon, and a considerable amount of lime juice. Leave
all this to the agent.
When, however, you have got safely to the poll, bear
in mind that the return is the difficult point, as Com-
mander CHEYNE will admit. In the meantime try to get
up the electoral steam, though, ultimately, you will
probably have to trust to your canvass. With a view to
this, some resort to ticking. We recommend ready
money. Russia duck is not to be relied on.
Now address your constituents. Point out to them
that you have been standing for the borough several
hours, Do this significantly, and you may perhaps
induce the best bred among them to offer you a seat.
If they do, take it at once, and, without further delay,
putting "M.P." on your card, insist on the Railway
Company regarding it as your return ticket, and start
for town.
If you arrive after midnight, knock up the Speaker,
who is bound at all hours to show you to your seat, call
for something at the bar for the good of the House,
and, getting the Common Serjeant to stir a little mace
into it, by way of giving it a flavour, ask him to call

The die is cast! The doom of Dissolution has fallen. But resur-
rection, strange to say, will precede death. On the 23rd of this
month the Parliament of 1874 will rise to sit no more. It was not
lovely in its life. In its death it will only be what it was in its life

Hamlet recommends his mother-
“Fling away the worser half of it,
And live the purer with the other half."
“Not CAUGHT YET !" (After Landseer.)
The secret has been well kept. Except a whisper of cabs collared
a week ago in a big borough-bespeaking an eye
to a poll-nothing
seems to have oozed out in betrayal of the Cabinet resolve. So it was like the bursting of a bombshell when, on Monday, March 8,
in the Lords, my Lord BEACONSFIELD, as curtly as words could do it, and in the Commons the CHANCELLOR of the EXCHEQUER, with
less economy of breath, announced that Government, having settled its Irish difficulties, got its Military and Naval Estimates passed,
and its Supply within reach of a vote on account, had come to the conclusion that Easter would be the pleasantest time to perform the
Hari-Kari, and April, month of smiles and tears, the fittest for fights big with the joy of victory, and the dumps of defeat.
So the writs will be out before the end of March, the “roaring month ;” and by All Fools' Day the country will be elbow-deep in
the mess and muddle of its Elections; and early in the merry month of May a brand-new Parliament will be at work with its new
broom, and perhaps-who knows ? -a new set of hands, officers and petty officers, in charge of the good ship Britannia !
The issue is in the hands of JOHN BULL. Before May he will have to audit the accounts his servants render, and set his seal to
them by retention of his present stewards, or refuse it, by the appointment of new ones.
A difficult task it should be, seeing that, according to the organs to whose tunes we listen for the case of the Ins and Outs, if not

stopped three-quarters of an hour), and at Hazeborough Junction
(where no record of the time was kept) were received with the loudest
of cheers.
As it was represented to me, shortly after leaving the Junction,
that our earlier stoppages had rather interfered with the ordinary
traffic on the line, I suggested that we should proceed direct to our
destination. This concession was gratefully acknowledged by the
Railway Officials, who, however, insisted that I should have a final
opportunity
of addressing my fellow-passengers. Feeling that I had
no right to refuse this proposal, I consented. The train was stopped
at the junction of several lines, and danger-signals were hoisted
in all directions. In less than an hour, some dozen trains coming
from various parts of the country, had stopped behind and in front
of ours. The passengers having descended, I addressed the meeting
from the signal-box. I was listened to with great attention by
everybody, with the exception of those who had travelled by my own
train, who rudely declared that they had heard what I was saying
before! Having finished my speech, the passengers returned to
their respective carriages, and the traffic on the line was resumed.
The remainder of our journey was without incident. We arrived
at our terminus only five hours late. On entering the Station I
was received with the most enthusiastic applause. The Railway
Officials immediately interviewed me, and suggested that I might
then and there hold a meeting. As I was rather fatigued by my
exertions, I pointed out that the only persons I should like to address
(as my local arrangements were all made) were those who had accom-
panied me. I added that I feared the passengers would be fa-
tigued, and that, in fact, I found myself falling off to sleep. I
therefore decided upon going to my hotel forthwith. I was escorted
to a carriage-and-six, and the procession (which included six brass
bands and two hundred torch-bearers) started for the Stentors' Arms,
where I close this page of my diary before going to bed. I must get

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

A COMMON SENSE CANDIDATE.
(In reply to a Requisition from a body of Electors in-
viting him to become a Member of Parliament.)
GENTLEMEN,
I HEREBY acknowledge the receipt of your
application requesting me to stand for the representation
of our County.
As the office of a Member of Parliament is laborious,
tiresome, and unpaid, I am very loth to accept it. How-
ever, since the men who solicit it are not fit for it, whereas
I am, and, being well-off and unemployed, can afford to
take it, if I were to refuse it I should decline a duty.
But the work of a Member of Parliament is so hard
and so heavy, that of the two situations I would really
rather be saddled with that of High Sheriff.
I hope, therefore, you will all understand that, in
consenting to let myself be proposed as your Representa-
tive, I confer upon you a very great favour.
As my political principles may not be known to every
voter, I will send a statement of them to a newspaper,
whence you can, if you please, extract it, and print it
for distribution. If necessary, I will also declare my
opinions at a public meeting, which can be called for
that purpose. But, as they can be expressed in few
words, I shall make only a short speech, not wishing,
when I have little to say, to let myself be known for a
fool by my much speaking.
In making that speech, if I am interrupted by any
shouts, cries, or idle questions, I shall immediately hold
my tongue, and retire.
The expenses of printing and publishing cards, cir-
culars, and other advertisements requesting people to
vote for me must be paid by those who desire to have
me returned. My constituents, or would-be constitu-
ents, must also defray all other charges incidental to my
election, or their attempt to effect that object.
In conclusion, I can only say, that nothing but a
strong sense of the obligations of my position as an inde-
pendent man could induce me to undertake an employ-
ment, which will withdraw me from my occupations and
amusements for six months in the year, besides compelling

the audience. But somebody else
wanted the last word, so that was
cut out, not by us. The conclusion,
then, becoming idiotic, (one of us was
remonstrated with by a “Public"
on the impotence of our finish), it
was restored, and, till now, we fondly
imagined that it remained. After all,
we wrote it. The end described by
your worthy Representative strikes
us as the most idiotic yet devised;
but, no doubt, somebody else will yet
supply a worse.
As for the final exit of Stephanie,
which you so graphically describe,
it is in all respects precisely what
we didn't intend, and don't like.
If you were a Dramatist, Mr.
Punch (but indeed being everything
of course you are), your humorous
soul would be much impressed by
the common belief of our Actors in
their superior knowledge of our art,
as well as of their own. On the
stage everybody, except the Author,
knows the Author's business. Why
on earth, then, doesn't everybody,
except the Author, write plays?

DOWN AMONG THE DEAD MEN.
In an instructive Return indicating very, general
malversation of Civic parochial funds from the charitable
purposes for which they were originally destined to those
of eating and drinking, a Royal Commission, quoted in
the Times, particularises a dinner given in St. Botolph's,
Aldgate, by the Churchwardens, out of supplies voted by
the vestry, at an expense of £60 annually; the vote
being, generally exceeded in actual cost by some £30.
This banquet is held “ on visiting the tombs.” In an-
other parish, the Commissioners tell us, eight wine mer-
chants are employed by the local Government, their
eight bills, in 1879, having amounted to £63 7s.6d. Of
this sum £2 28. went in sacramental wine; the rest for
the poor and vestry meetings; how much to the former
and how little to the latter, or vice versa, the parochial
account showed not. The Commissioners relate that-
“The wine is stored in a cellar at the church." This
latter parish is that of St. Sepulchre. There is, indeed,
in this juxtaposition of burial vault with wine cellar
something peculiarly sepulchral. These orgies are doubt-
less jolly, if grim. The revellers might almost be con-
ceived quaffing their wine, in the style of Scandinavian
heroes of old,
out of skulls. Their wine should have a
great deal of body in it, though it be Vin de Grave, and
as such, very different stuff from “King Death's" in the
song, which tells you how he “poured out the coal-black
wine."

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOR ALL PARTIES.

OPPOSITION.
Q. What weak and ephemeral Statesman of our times,
possessing the inhumanity of a Nero, and the agility of a
Rich, is unfit to be trusted with the driving of a com-
mon city-omnibus, owing to his gross lack of the first
principles of integrity, judgment, and discretion ?
A. Lord BEACONSFIELD.
HOME-RULE.
Q. Who is the rising political day-star, who, gifted
with the strength of Vulcan, the humour of VANCE, the
polish of RICHELIEU, and the eloquence of DEMOSTHENES,
has crossed the Atlantio twice in six months (a feat un-
attempted by COLUMBUS), and has charged his down-
trodden country nothing worth mentioning for doing it ?
A. Mr. PARNELL.
GOVERNMENT.
Q. Who is the escaped maniac who, though he ought
to be in Bedlam, has got loose at Midlothian, and, to the
everlasting shame and degradation both of the country
that has produced him and of the renegades he has
cajoled, has refused obstinately to see triumph in Cyprus,
ascendency at Berlin, peace in Asia, or even honour at
home ?
A. Mr. GLADSTONE.

THE MAN OF LIGHT AND LEADING.
To oblige the Public, Mr. Punch, with his customary
kindness, published a fortnight ago a prophetic account
of the University Boat Race, showing how the result of
the contest would not possibly be known on the appointed
day, because it would be too dark to see the finish! He
spoke the truth, if not the whole truth. It was not only
too dark to see the finish, but the start either. Mr.
Punch (as he always is) was right. The Clerk of the
Weather, disgusted at the attempt to row the race before
daylight, turned on a fog of the best London quality-

'Tis lovely to look back on! Stretched my pall
Of poisonous asphyxia over all,
THE BROTHERHOOD OF BEER.
Week after week, unintermittently,
Till mortala, finding that they could not see,
E'en at high noon, or what one noon supposes,
Two feet before their fog-choked frost-nipped noses,
Imagined, growing gloomier, grimier, glummer,
That day had wholly vanished-following Summer!
Lord! what a lark it was to see them groping,
Like blind black-beetles, beer-bemused to dizziness,
At early, but Egyptian, morn to business!
Sniffing and sneezing, grumbling, vainly hoping
For my departure, air-draughts less pea-soupy,
Lungs less smoke-clogged, and bronchial tubes less croupy.
I raised the death-rates and the gas-bills high,
And lowered vigour and vitality.
Christmas I made a lurid murky mystery,
A sombre, sunless, swart, Serbonian season,
For misty misery unmatched in history.
I almost robbed the artist-world of reason;
Poor painter-men went mad above their madder :
So shall my evil spell extend to May,
When scantier, less saleable, and sadder
Must be the R.A.'s annual Art array.

When men of course expected no such thing,
Thinking I'd fled, and of my reign left no trace,

From distant downy beds at early dawn,
So to be sold!
Returning, pinched and peevish, cross and cold,
To tell the world that though men dare to row

Champions defying deluge, braving blast,

And, in the dim tracts of Utopia's land,
At Merlin's feet the would-be Graduate prayed.
For, yielding to his kindlier moods, the Sage
Had watched her at her petulance and play,
Even when they seemed unloveable, and laughed
As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew
Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,
Perceiving that she was but half disdained,
Began to break her sports with graver fits,
Turn wholly blue; and thus she clung to him
Fixt in her will; and so the terms went by.

Then Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(St. James's and the Haymarket.)
Old Cronies is the title of the duologue, which serves as a most
amusing lever du rideau at the St. James's. It is brilliantly
written by Mr. THEYRE SMITH, and played by Messrs. MACKINTOSH
and WENMAN in admirable taste, and with consummate finish.
The revival of Still Waters Run Deep, will interest those who
remember its original production at the Olympic, those who have
heard so much of it since, those who have seen it indifferently
performed by Amateursand what set of Amateurs has not tried it
at some time or other ?-and the Amateurs themselves who have
represented it, and who pride themselves on their own original
readings of the several parts.
But with how it was first played at the Olympic, when ALFRED
WIGAN was Mildmay, Mrs. ALFRED WIGAN Mrs.
Sternhold, GEORGE
VINING Hawksley, and EMERY Old Potter, I have very little to do
just now-that is, as far as comparison goes.
Most Theatre-goers are acquainted with John Mildmay, Captain
Hawksley, Mrs. Sternhold, and Old Potter ; and all who know the
play, are aware, that, in the First Act, Mildmay is deceiving his
family circle by assuming le rôle d'un gogo for his own ends, which
it is the purpose of the play to work out to a triumphant finish.
Now Mr. KENDAL does not let the audience see that he is only
pretending to be a simpleton; he treats them as he treats Mrs.
Sternhold, and attempts to deceive them as he has deceived her.
As the secret of the play is kept from the audience during
the First Act, and is indeed only very gradually developed, it is
left for the Actors to enlighten us by very marked exhibition of
individuality. We soon learn, in the First Act, that Hawksley
is a villain, but only gradually, how great is his villainy, and to
what extent Mrs. Sternhold has been indiscreet.
If the representatives of Hawksley and Mrs. Sternhold were, so
to speak, to "walk through” their parts, no audience of average
intelligence could remain in ignorance of what the Author had in
tended their characters to be, or what were their motives for action.

Though strong, successful, scathless, to true knight

Have knighthood's spirit, proud and prompt to strike
In high and honourable cause, and yet,

Well, you set
The standard high, but, no doubt, both are game
To whip the world, and that is much the same.

Sir Jingo. Why, BULL erect and foreign foes all flat,
Like tumbled ninepins, or the knights you shot

Sir Lancelot. Pray let that pass. The knight his sword who drew,
Or laid his lance in rest, for a bad cause,
Not in defence of violated laws,
Or weakness that lacked champion, won no praise,

So fail I, whatsoe'er his skill or force,
To see his claim to honour who'd divorce

“Attentions have been showered upon Prince BISMARCK this day from all

Here's an exception to the general rule;
One born on All Fools' Day, but born no fool.
That, however, having been the day of the great Chancellor's
birth, he observed it as a high festival. May we presume to imagine
the dainties whereon he chose to regale himself in keeping the Feast

pleased to entertain me when I am a convalescent than when I am
in rude and blooming health. There is more of a rush to get me, so
to speak. If I am correct in my surmise, I fancy it is because I
am more amenable as an invalid than when in robust, perhaps ob-
jectionably robust health. It is quite possible. Judging by my own
experience of others-invalids I mean to whom I have given an
asylum-it is indeed highly probable. An invalid wants but little
here below, and he is gratefully ready to take that little with the
least possible trouble to his host. He has been giving trouble so
long-he has been like CHARLES THE SECOND," so unconscionably
long a-dying," and has got well after all, which the sad Merry
Monarch didn't, that he feels he owes some reparation to society
which is represented to him pro tem. by his immediate friends who
have received him into their home.
He is, consequently, as I have said, "amenable ;.” his tempo-
rary disposition is yielding; he is grateful for small mercies; his
habits are regular ; he does not want to gad about; he does not
require to be perpetually, amused; he is a plain eater, a small
drinker; he needs rest, and takes it, retires to bed at an early hour,
and, above all, he is peculiarly quiet. These remarks apply, of

is and always' has been, from year's end to
year's end-excepting a month's excitement
in town during the season--the life of this
happy family at Motemoss, Sheepton-on-Sea.
They rise early; not too early, not with
the first lark, but with the second or third.
Before nine o'clock breakfast Squire Cos-
SETT is out in his garden, and then out on
his horse. The Squire,
being a Magistrate
and a Captain of local Volunteers, and also
one of the Board at the neighbouring
watering-place, has his duties, which gene-
rally occupy his mornings. In the hunting
season, to go out with Mrs. COSSETT, a per-
fect horsewoman, three times a week, is his
duty and pleasure. They don't overdo it,
but return in good time, generally for lun-
cheon at two sharp. The Squire has some
afternoon business, which keeps him till
nearly dinner-time, in Lambsgate, unless
he is visiting his tenants, whether cottagers
or farmers, or walking over his property

carriage paying a round of visits, accom-
panied by a female friend, and if very
warm, and no north-easterly wind to catch
him suddenly, and send him coughing
home, by their convalescent guest.
And then the quiet evenings, the chatty,
pleasant, homely dinner, the snug, room,
the cosy chairs, the cheerful fire, the ex-
cellent coffee, the wee-est nipperkin of old
liqueur, the fragrant tobacco (if the con-
valescent is up to it), the soothing music,
only played when the demand is unani-
mous, and the punctuality of the sound of
the flat candlesticks on the table in the old
hall, and the hearty "Good night!” and
good wishes! O peaceful hour of ten p.M.,

I hated Clubs and smoking-rooms, and
festive gatherings, and musio-parties, and
dinner-parties, and crowded rooms, and all
excitement generally. “Never again with
you, ROBIN " I have murmured to myself
as I have snuggled down into the yielding
comfortable bed while watching the warm
flickering firelight.
Such was our life at Motemoss. A few
friends, now and then, to a sociable cheery
dinner, and away, at ten punctually; no
irregularities of time or diet; no subse-
quent regrets ; no yearnings for soda-and-
lemon; no distaste for breakfast. Over our
door might be inscribed the motto of the
pious Benedictines, Pax."
In this delightful state of reverie and
rest I had remained a fortnight, carefully
carrying out the doctor's orders, when one
afternoon, on my return from my gentle
walk, a servant, evidently muck furried
and dismayed by something unusual, came
up to me and said,

The Music-Hall Baritone—"Because that new Jingo

FLUTTERING A DOVE-COT.
(An incident from the Diary of a Convalescent,
told in a few Chapters properly belonging to
the Series usually headed "Friends at a Dis-
tance,” which has appeared from time to time
in these pages.)
CHAPTER II.
“OH DEAR, WHAT CAN THE MATTER BE ?
This was the telegram :-
Coming down this train see you business impor-
tant."
It was sent by “R. BOILINGBROOK, Holborn
Viaduct,” just five minutes before the starting of
he train.
To reply, “ Don't!” was impossible: he was
already half-way on the road by the time I received
his message.
“ Important Business !” In my state of tran-
quil convalescence and listless ease the word
business” was quite enough to unsettle me
without the "important.” Here was I, so calm,
so quiet, in such pure contented enjoyment of the
repose at Motemoss, so far from all mundane
thoughts and cares, so willing to remain in this
state of all but intellectual coma, and to be thus
rudely broken in upon by Business important”!
“Here!” I complained aloud in a querulous
tone to myself as I stood all alone, telegram in
hand, in the comfortable study—“Here have I
been ordered-positively ordered by the doctor-to
do nothing-to do absolutely nothing for weeks.
And I retire far away from London to do it; I
hide myself; I don't give my address even to my
Jearest friend, telling my family to forward my
letters under cover once a week; and, within the
first fortnight, before, so to speak, I have had
time to recover my breath, down comes Dick

shouldn't so much mind if I were propped up
with pillows in an arm-chair, and had the ghastly
pallor, the quavering voice, with the lean lank
hands, and, in fact, in a general way got up like
Mr. IRVING as Louis the Eleventh. But I'm not ;
and BOILINGBROOK, seeing me now as a convales-
cent, looking three times as well as ever I did
when in full health in London, will look upon me
as a shirker of work, a sham, and a sponger on the
credulous sympathy and generous hospitality of
my friends. At the very idea my brow becomes
clammy, for I see myself exposed as a hypochon,

is the gentleman who is coming to flutter the Dove-cot
at Motemoss with his important business.
It has utterly upset me, to begin with. What is his

and drinking heartily, he'll show me no compassion, but have me
up to town to work at once; perhaps take me back with him!
There is only one thing I implore the Ladies and the Squire to
remember, and that is as I put it to them piteously,
"Don't let him keep me up late.”
That is my dread. If I am not in bed by half-past-ten at the

told that a glass of brandy will be his ruin, and who dreads the
proximity of the bottle, so I, knowing my own feebleness, knowing
how difficult it is to retire where a guest wants to remain, pray my

and the Ladies not to delay their departure beyond their usual time,

we never break through it for anyone.” Then he changes the
subject.. “By the way, what does your friend drink? Anything ?
Everything ?"
Yes, anything and everything. He is, I say, one of the most
genial fellows in the world, and the easiest to please, and no sooner
have I given him this character than there is a ring at the hall-

inner canine guards bounding and barking and growling, causing
the master and mistress and servants to chorus out in different
tones, “Quiet, Pincher! Down, Glen! Quiet, Snap! Be quiet,

WELL done! And surely it is well.

But Time is champion of Truth,
And love of Truth has firm upborne
This fighter 'gainst the doubt and scorn

Of Hatred's howl or Envy's hiss.

Wisdom reserves its calm applause

For justice, and no clamour broke
The higher aim, the larger cause.
The passion of his seventy years.
And when the dust of conflict clears,
The fervent tongue that scared the wise
And party passions pale and die,
With too tempestuous eloquence,
And like dawn-frighted spectres fly
Ne'er lost its hold of fact and sense,
The flock of hates, and spites, and fears : Or paltered with the plague of lies.
When blind appeals to passions blind Let lesser eyes spy out the faults
No longer stir the State to storm,
That marked the arduous campaign;
And Patriot Honour's placid form

EDISON'S LAST.
MR. PUNCH,
PEOPLE have become slightly sceptical of late about Edisonian
inventions, but if that discoverer's alleged latest find be a fact, he
has nearly as good as hit on the Philosopher's Stone. He is said
to have found out methods, electrical and chemical, by which he can
extract more gold from the rejected residuum of auriferous quartz
than is obtainable by means of common crushing mills from the
virgin rocks. At an expense of not more than five dollars to the ton
he gets gold in the ratio of 1:4000 per ton of concentrated “tailings; "
and he has contracted for millions of tons of “tailings.” Unless
the foregoing. particulars are fabulous, Mr. EDISON will very soon
be another Midas in respect of gold-though certainly not of brains
and ears.
Is there, Mr. Punch, any possibility of a political EDISON ? We
know there exists a certain many-headed multitude whom aristocrats
are wont to call the dregs of society, but for whom Mr. BRIGHT
invented the more euphonious and euphemious title of “the resi-
duum." Is it to be expected that among the Liberal Statesmen
apparently on the point of coming in for a long term of power, a
master-mind will succeed in devising, some way to get the utmost
possible electoral good out of these political "tailings" ?
Such a possibility, I trust, Mr. Punch, you will not deride as the
suggestion of a too sanguine optimist. Both as a staunch friend of
the people and ally of the publicans, particularly those who keep
coffee public-houses--of which two more, I rejoice to see, have been
this week opened by the London and Provincial Coffee Palace
Company-permit me to style myself, ever yours sincerely,
PUBLICOLA,
AFTER DISSOLUTION.
(Wed. April 14, 1880.)
And is it true that after Death,
When dissolution and decay
Have quenched life's force and stopped its breath,
The dead once more revisit day?
Those who their Place no more shall know,
For whom life's Ministry is o'er,
Once, only once, though dead, may go
Back to the haunts they loved before !
There, the last office done with, grief
One sad assuagement finds; they meet
Once more their Visionary Chief,
A throng of ghosts in Downing Street !
Once more, like Ministers of State
In form, though force has fled, they hold
The hollow mockery of debate
On Phantom Projects, as of old.
Once more-but who shall seek to pierce
That dread Last Council's mystery ?
Or_say what grave themes they rehearse
Dead ghosts debating how to die!

true that in one of my infallible oracles only the other day I read that
what has happened is not inexplicable, and that "it may even be
affirmed that
the reaction is more moderate than might have been
expected.” That is all very well for the omniscient Editor ; but
how about his poor followers? Why did he not give me, and the
many like me, who hang upon his words, a hint beforehand of what
he knew so well was coming ?
Could you kindly answer me these questions:-
1. Have my able Editors been deceiving me?
2. Or is it possible that they knew nothing about the real mind
of the Nation they assumed to speak for?

OMNIBUS FULL AND FREE.
A CORRESPONDENT of the Times, “R. B.”
calls attention to facts suggestive of a way
by which the question between Churchmen
and Dissenters concerning interment might
easily be settled to the satisfaction of both
sides. He says that “Mr. MORGAN does not
seem to be acquainted with the condition of
our Churchyards," which resembles that
presented by the “Gravedigger's Scene in
Hamlet," insomuch that they having mostly
been full “ for the last 300 years," and
English people having all that while been
burying their dead in the ashes of the
dead," now there “scarcely ever is a grave
dag in the remotest churchyard without
bones, skulls, &c. being, thrown up.
"Moreover," adds 'R. B.," "the level of
all churchyards is considerably above the
level of the church-floor." if all this is
really the case, it speaks for itself, and as
distinctly as possible tells Mr. OSBORNE
MORGAN, and everybody else who cares to
be told, the two things the Legislature
should do for the solution of this grave
difficulty; that is, pass an Act to open the
Churchyards to all manner of Dissenting
bodies, and close them immediately against
all bodies whatsoever; thus both opening
and closing them to everybody without dis-
tinction of sect. So much for the present,
from Yours everlastingly,
YORICK.

LORD HARTINGTON took a constitutional
walk on Thursday evening last from Windsor
Railway Station to the Castle. He politely
declined the use 'of the perambulator sent
to meet him. His gait and his gingham
were much admired. His carriage was con-
spicuous from its absence. While waiting at
the station for his return train, he carefully
surveyed the new Liberal Platform.
Neat and Appropriate.
It is stated that at the last social Cabinet
meeting, the Prime Minister read, with
much pathos, the scene from SHELLEY'S
Prometheus Unbound, ending with the
couplet-

But at last those Liberals, all in a body,

And as good as admitted that none of them knew.
But just as the Tories were all at full snigger,
There suddenly popped up the funniest figure;
Glad in Galashiels checks, grey, green, and red,
And a brand new gift silk-cap on his head;
And he himself was sallow and thin,
With keen clear eyes that could scathe or win,
And sparse white hairs and a parchment skin,
Bcant tuft on cheek, no beard on chin,
But lips firm-clench'd as an iron gin;
And no Liberal soul could enough admire
The grim grey man and his quaint attire;
But the Tories scowled and gave vent to their ire.

MEDICAL M.P.'S.
TUGO1
DENTISTS
w
DEAR DR. Punch,
REFLECTING persons have begun to see that, for
legislation on sanitary matters and questions involving
medical science, the services of a sufficient number of
competent Medical Men such as yourself, Sir, are wanted
in the House of Commons. You, of course, personally,
are engaged elsewhere. In other cases the objection may
be taken that physicians, surgeons, and general prac-
titioners of eminence would find it impossible to attend
to both their patients and their parliamentary duties.
Vain would be the ring at the night-bell of an Honour-
able Gentleman accustomed to spend his night at St.
Stephen's, after the usual fashion of the votaries of that
protomartyr, and not to go home till morning, till day-
light doth appear.
But the world knows nothing of its greatest
medical men, like you know whom, Sir. Philosophers
accustomed to think for themselves, declare their
thoughts, and deviate from routine, thereby alarm the
majority of both their Profession and the Public, get
themselves reputed eccentric, and obtain a practice, if
any, very select indeed.
A moderate number of Medical Members of that sort
would suffice for the requirements of the House of
it? Obviously by soliciting them to take seats, and
paying them pretty handsomely when they take them,
so as to make it worth their while to sit !
If those conditions could not be fulfilled, it might be
found more practicable to introduce medical philosophy
into the Legislature viâ the House of Lords.
Of the two Houses, a Physician or Surgeon, Physiologist
and rational being, would decidedly prefer the Peers, on
account of the reasonable hours wont to be kept in that
House, as compared with the other. Also, because of
the comparative brevity of Noble Lords' eloquence.
I enclose my card, by which your readers will perceive
that I am at home from ten till twelve in the morning,
and from three till five in the afternoon. In the mean-
while believe me your affectionate Brother Chip,

this Parliament,” (somewhat superfluous,
methinks). “Meanwhile, do you, Gentle-
men of the House of Commons, repair to the

some proper person to be your Speaker.'
Whereupon Black Rod whipped out Com-

Then my Lords Commissioners retired to

my Lords began to swear-a thing they sel-
dom do in that decorous Chamber. Con-
sidering the complexion of the new House
of Commons, their Lordships, as Conserva-
tives, may be pardoned for swearing.
But it was the first night of the New Par-
liament. Time brings about its revenges
in this Olympian abode too, where things
change not with the changing times. Even
lordly heads "alter, as they alteration find,"
and the Peers' Ministerial Bench receives
new tenants.
Punch bids them welcome, and wishes
them a good time.
Then to our faithful Commons-as yet
inchoate and incoherent, limp, and gelatin-
ous-like a lobster that has just changed its
shell, and has not put on new hardness.
Pretty, as Mr. Pepys would say, to see Mem-
bers changing their sides, and looking about
for new perches. Methought the difficulty
of finding seats was over. Yet here it is
again. Some evidently at a loss-some ready
to slip in anywhere. The Liberals in a
difficulty, having more Members than seats.
The Conservatives uneasy, with seats to let,
and no Members to take them. Home-
Rulers divided. SHAW's brigade took up a
strong position on the Ministerial side. The
Member for Meath's tail coiled itself away
among the Conservatives, who evidently
shrank from the contact. Will they christen
the intruders “PARNELL'S Hermits" ?

THE MYSTERIOUS VISITOR.
(A Romance of the Latest Ministerial
Movements.)
The crisis had arrived. Lord HART-
INGTON had called upon Lord GRANVILLE,
Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT had visited Mr.
Bright, and Mr. FORSTER had waited upon
the Duke of ARGYLL. The Earl of NORTH-
BROOK had been in frequent communication
with Mr. CHILDERS, and Lord WOLVERTON
had been here, there, and everywhere. But,
of course, the centre of attraction was the
"long unlovely street," in which the new
Premier was doing his utmost to entertain
right worthily a swift succession of Royal
Messengers from Windsor. Day and night
the desirable family mansion was watched
by an enthusiastic crowd, who cheered every
fresh arrival, every new departure.
As night approached the patient throng

observed that amongst the many distin-
guished personages seeking admittance to
the private residence of the Premier Elect,
had been a youth whose features were un-
known to fame. This young person, with
all the fire, energy, and determination of
early manhood, had been seen morning,
noon, and night on the door-steps. Now

ONLY A DONKEY.
At Birmingham a man was charged with allowing his donkey
to starve to death in its stable, where it was found dead after
the lapse of a foodless week, having eaten up nearly the whole
of its wooden manger, and gnawed some brick-ends. The
Defendant's excuse was that he had been too busy about the
Elertions to remember a donkey. The case created great mirth
in Court, and the Defendant was ultimately tined five shillings.
He-haw!
I'm getting scant of breath and slack of jaw,
That bray would scarce evoke
The chuckle of the cad who spies a joke,
In everything about me, takes my voice
As type of a stupidity more crass
Than bis, who oft hath made me much rejoice
That I was but an ass.
He-haw!
Who was it said that no one ever saw
A donkey dead? Some minutes hence, at rest
For the first time since I was foaled,
I fancy that my body stiff and cold
Will somewhat blunt the point of that rare jest.
Here have I starved for a whole week at least,
No, stop! Shall an ass lie? I've made a feast
On brick-ends and the timber of my manger.
More mirth, my masters! There is little danger
Of failure in materials for mirth
Whilst despot man-and donkeys-walk the earth,
Two or four-footed.
Long-suffering Issachars are sweetly suited
To sharpen jest's keen tooth on-better even
Than brick-ends! Steven days, and long nights seven,
Alone and foodless, save for timber rotten,
Simply forgotten !
How should Man think 'midst the Election's Babel
Of a mere donkey starving in a stable ?
Stick and short commons, labour and low diet,
Are donkey's destiny-'tis Wisdom's fiut-
Shall a thick-hided brute, long-eared and humble,
Presume to grumble,
Or hope by Man-that humorist !- to be pitied ?
And yet-he-havo -had destiny but fitted
Asses for drudgedom's duties more completely,
Hunger and cudgelling had come more sweetly.
There seems, I know not where, a slight mistake.

The ATTORNEY-GENERAL pointed out that the nomination of the
Committee to inquire if Mr. BRADLAUGH was a person by law per-
mitted to affirm, was a matter in furtherance of the Royal Message
giving direction to Members of the House to take the oath. The
SPEAKER might have disposed of the question, but having doubts
had referred them to the House, and the House had taken the usual
course to settle_them-a Committee. The precedents were strictly
in point. The House must be constituted before it could hear the
Queen's Speech. This was the removal of a difficulty arising in
course of its constitution.
Mr. Stanley Leighton backed the cry of WOLFF with a cry more
strident. This was purely a legal question. The Committee might
report that the Member for Northampton was at liberty to affirm
instead of swearing. Then all the fuss would have been for nothing.
Or they might report that in their opinion he could not affirm in-

“ THE BROAD END OF THE WEDGE.”
(By Mr. Punch's Prophetic Reporter.)
20th May, 18–
YESTERDAY the new Government Office, commenced some four years ago on the
Thames Embankment, was opened to the public for the transaction of business.
As this novel bureau is unique, it deserves description.
It will be remembered by the rising generation that the building was first
called into being to meet the needs created by the passing of the Imperial
Metropolitan Gas and Water Supply Act. The original design had many
architectural merits, but during the course of construction the plans had, from
time to time, to be altered to meet the requirements created by the passing of
measures of a kindred character. Hence the somewhat patch-work appearance
of the new office, which, to tell the truth, is useful rather than ornamental. It
cannot compare, in outward effect, with the neighbouring buildings.
For instance the Technical Education Museum (recently erected and endowed
by the Municipality of London), is infinitely grander, and the Anti-Monopoly
Fish, Fruit, and Butchers'-meat Co-operative Emporium unquestionably more
picturesque. Still, backed and flanked by its screen of forest trees (transplanted
last year from Kew and Kensington by the American process), it is far from an
unæsthetio pile, and may well extort the admiration even of foreigners,
On entering the main building, the visitor finds himself in a suite of one
hundred and twenty rooms devoted to the management of the Metropolitan Gas
and Water Supply. London (Proper) takes a score of apartments, and the
affiliated Cities and Boroughs (extending as far as York, Brighton, Bath, and
Colchester), the remainder. Here the householder can obtain every information
and assistance; can pay his latest gas-bill, or complain of his newest supply-
pipe. Passing on through a short passage, an enormous hall is reached, which
serves as the Central Office of the National Banking Corporation. This com-
bination ” (to use a Yankee_expression) is, of course, inerely an elaboration
of the Post Office Savings Banks' scheme. Still, as every one knows, the
Corporation has taken the place in public estimation of the position once occu-
pied by the Joint Stock Banks of Limited or un-Limited Liability, formerly so
much resorted to. Beyond the hall are a few rooms devoted to the Government
Metropolitan Cab Department. This soanty accommodation is in marked con-
trast to the three large wings that have been found necessary to accommo-
date the various branches of the Government General Amalgamated Railway
and Steam-Boat Offices, by which the entire trade of the nation is now con-
ducted. A corridor leads from this enormous branoh-department to the rooms
of the Perishable Food Controllers, which are next to the sanctum of the Chief
of the Patent Medicine and Quack Nostrum Examiners. For the convenience
of Lady Students for the Stage, there is a separate entrance to the Sock and
Buskin Branch in the Strand, close to the Government Theatre and State Opera
House. Test Rehearsals for declamation and deportment, are, for the present,
still held at the Royal Albert Hall as the only enclosed area large enough for
the purpose, now the management of the theatres has become a branch of the
Government.
Perhaps the most interesting department in the whole building is the
Sumptuary Laws Enforcement Office. The Commissioners have an entire block
to themselves. In one of the rooms new dresses are registered. Here some-
times the most amusing scenes occur. The Registrar, who sits as Chief Judge,
has made it a rule never to pass a costume of either an extravagant or unhealthy
oharacter, in spite of the tears and blandishments of the
most emotional or
captivating of modistes. His colleague, at the head of the House Erecting and
Furnishing Department, is equally conscientious; and it requires builders and
decorators of more than ordinary perseverance and astuteness to gain the
Government sanction for a badly-oonstructed building, a tasteless scheme of
decoration, or an insanitary scheme of house-drainage, or water-supply.. The
Furniture Design Department is also extremely interesting, as the Commissioners
take the greatest pains that all the chairs, sofas, and tables brought before
them shall be of the best quality, and in the best taste. Reclamations” (as the
French would say), are not unfrequently heard in the branch of the bureau
charged with the licensing and pricing of this class of article.
The vast building has not yet been christened; but will probably bear the
appropriate, if somewhat cumbrous, title of The Government Universal
Public and Private Business Transaction Office and State Department for the
Extension of the Principle of Paternal Interference in Great Things, and
Small.” This rather lengthy designation in the course of years may possibly be
abbreviated by the Public into "The General Circumlocution Office.”
O SEASON supposed of all free flowers,
Made lovely by light of the sun,
Of garden, of field, and of tree-flowers,
Thy singers are surely in fun!
Or what is it wholly unsettles
Thy sequence of shower and shine,
And maketh thy pushings and petals
To shrivel and pine ?
Why is it that o'er the wild waters
That beastly North-Easter still blows,
Dust-dimming the eyes of our daughters,
Blue-nipping each nice little nose ?
Why is it these sea-skirted islands
Are plagued with perpetual chills,
Driving men to Italian or Nile-land's
From Albion's ills ?
Happy he, O Springtide, who hath found thee,
All sunlit, in luckier lands,
With thy garment of greenery round thee,
And belted with blossomy bands.
From us by the blast thou art drifted.
All brag of thy beauties is bosh;
When the songs of thy singers are sifted,
They simply won't wash.
True, the pictures in proud Piccadilly
And beauteous Bond Street are hung ;
True, plaudits of LEIGHTON and MILLAIS
Fall soft from Society's tongue;
But what avail sunshine and fowers,
In paint upon Burlington walls,
When without all is dust-drift, and showers,
And whirlwinds and squalls ?
True Clerical cohorts are flocking
To Exeter Hall in the Strand;
We see the episcopal stocking;
The Canon is loud in the land;
What then, when the only May Meeting
A fellow finds time to attend
Is the North-Easter's boisterous greeting
At every street-end?
What lunatic lune, what vain vision,
Thy laureate, Springtide, may move
To sing thee-oh, bitter derision !-
As season of laughter and love ?
You make a man mad beyond measure,
O Spring, and thy lauders like thee
Thy flowers, thy pastimes and pleasures,
Are fiddlededee!

Of courtesy covering statecraft.

Well, I trust,

The world will not mistake my appetite.
For Humble Pie, however well embellished
By cook-craft, is a dish I never relished;
And this looks too much like it, for my mind.
A most unfortunate first course.
William.
You'll find
This Austrian plum good picking; and I stoop
To conquer.
Mr. Bull. Do you mean to lead your troop
To victory through the Caudine Forks? I'm sure
You are forgetting-as you did before-
That though to seem and not to be is bad,
To be and yet not seem 's almost as sad,
Sometimes, in issue. Meekly munching there,
You do not look imposing.

Mr. Bull. But I do. LAUNCELOT should not seem to creep,
Nor hot ACHILLES ape Uriah Heep

Followed so soon by what looks like retreat,
May be fine strategy—but looks like blunder;
And, seeing it, you really cannot wonder
If foes exult. 'I trust that you mean winning.
But this, in form at least, 's a bad beginning

THERE seems to be no doubt about the Revival of Trade. Prospec-

HARD LINES!
A STATUE Of BYRON, we are grieved to hear, is shortly
to be set face to face with the Great ACHILLES, whom
we know;" that greatest offender ever blown out of who
knows how many guns: that colossal embodiment of
“robur et æs triplex ;” that biggest, and most brazen-
faced of "cribs " from one of the young men with the
Horses of Monte Cavallo—80 often mistaken by country
cousins for a bronze likeness of the Iron Duke.
The pedestal of the Poet's statue, in Hamilton Place,
is, we are told, to be inscribed with the single word
“BYRON!” Why this further cruelty ? Is it not
enough to set the Poet in the modern and more durable
substitute for the pillory, but you must label him be-
sides? Don Juan may have been a grievous crime
against propriety, and even morality; but has it de-
served this? Bad as Byron's life may have been, it
can hardly be said to have fairly drawn down the re-
tribution that enrols him in that ignoble army of
martyrs, the tenants of that enlarged out-door Chamber
of Horrors, the hideous array of those heinous offenders
against taste, the London Street-Statues!
A sect of enthusiasts is loud for the abolition of
capital punishments; and yet we are content to go on
sentencing our unfortunate celebrities in Arts and Arms
to the infliction of asthetic public infamy, so long as
marble lasts, and bronze survives!
Our benighted and hard-hearted forefathers felt even
the pillory too cruel. Shall we, who boast our enlighten-
ment and humanity, retain its far crueller substitute-
rotten eggs apart-the pedestal ?

“ OURS" AND HOURS.
THE Cavalry Barracks at Knights-
bridge are perfect, with the excep-
tion of one insignificant detail. The
quarters of officers and men could
not be better, and the horses seem
to be thoroughly satisfied with their
stables. The riding-school is admi-
rable, and the mess. rooms and ante-
rooms are quite too awfully æsthetic.
And yet, to speak plainly, the place is
scarcely up to the time of day. There
is, to to be sure, a magnificent clock-
tower, containing an equally mag-
nificent clock, but both tower and
clock are so placed that the ocoupants
of the barracks can see neither. It
is rumoured that the regimental

MORE MEN OVERBOARD!
It is Mr. PLIMSOLL, and not the Hon. CHARLES VIL-
LIERS-Derby, and not Wolverhampton--that will provide
the life-buoy for our “Man Overboard,” of last week,
the Right Hon. W. Y. HARCOURT. There is another
man overboard since then, Mr. M'LAREN, the Lord
Advocate, flung over by the Wigtown Burghs.
If this goes on, the Government Ship will be getting
short-handed, or a system of seats that won't sink will
have to be adopted, like that advocated for our ocean
and river steam-boats.
It is not every Minister cast adrift without a seat to
float him that can expect to find a PLIMSOLL ready to
surrender his seat to him, as a generous cast-away has
been known to surrender his spar to a messmate whose
life he thought more important than his own.
Mr. PLIMSOLL thinks the cause he has at heart will
be better served by what Sir W. V. HARCOURT can do
for it in the House than by any efforts of his own there.
So he hands over his seat to the Home Secretary
battling with the waves without a spar, and himself
goes down, without a sigh, to the depths of private life!
The act' becomes Mr. PLIMSOLL. Impulsive he may
have been, but his impulses were always generous and
self-sacrificing: The ending of his parliamentary life
is consistent with its tenor; it shows more consideration
for his cause than for himself.

heavy road-rates, the bother of constant road-repairs, and the dis-
comforts of rough road-riding.
And shall not the man who sets himself to right this wrong,
who in his capital sixpenny pamphlet The Stones of London
(published by CASSELL), has given us a likeness of MACADAX,
history of his road-reform, and an account of the gradual dife-
gence from his admirable " antique viæ," made of stones of six-
ounce weight and two-inch guage, till our streets have become
the rough and costly horse-traps that we know-shall not EDTALS
FORDHAM Flower have his statue set up in the pages of Punck at
least, if not in some great London thoroughfare, to keep contractare
in check and surveyors at their work, as the Colossus of Roads!"
Behold it here! It remains for our Vestries and District Boards
to do their best to second his efforts by propagating his pamphlet
,
and putting in practice sound principles of road-making and righ:
methods of road-repair.
So Punch takes leave to re-christen EDWARD FORDHAM FLOWER,
one of the biggest-bodied, biggest-souled, and best-looking men in
London, on the strength of his present crusade for the comfort of his
fellow-dwellers in London.
He had already fought, and substantially won, a good fight for the
Horses, in his Bits and Bearing Reins. He has now set himself to
a task not less hard and not less urgent, the improvement of the
paving of the London streets, miscalled "Macadamised."
MACADAM was a long-headed Scotch road-surveyor at Bristol, who
died in 1836 at the age of eighty-one, and deserved to have inscribed
on his monument-
"He found England's roads cobble-stone, and left them Macadam."
He thought and worked out the great and simple truth that the
best way to make a smooth and durable road was to use for road-
metal six-ounce stones that would pass through a two-inch gauge;
he having proved by long and wide experiment these to be the stones
best fitted to unite, by their own angles, without any use of sand or
gravel, into a compact and impenetrable body.
Mr. FLOWER knew this sagacious Scotchman, who reformed the
whole system of road-making, not in England only, but all over the
world, wherever there are roads, and was but poorly paid for it by a
Parliamentary grant of £2000, and the ultimate repayment of his
expenses out of pocket.
He lived to see his principles everywhere adopted.
Had he lived till now, it would have been to see these principles
nominally followed, but practically shirked, by nine out of ten of
our road-contractors, and the violation winked at by almost as large
a proportion of our road-surveyors.
It serves the contractor's interests to supply stones of a pound weight
instead of six ounces, and of three-inch, instead of two-inch guage, and
to fill up the hollows left between such "base metal" with gravel,
to be crushed flat by the steam-roller, worked up by the traffic,
washed out by the rain, and finally carted off with the road-scrapings.
Then hey! for the hills and hollows all know so well, who travel
London roads on wheels,-the horses, who pull earts and carriages,
even more to their cost than the men who drive them and ride
behind them!
Mr. FLOWER has devoted himself, at cost of much money, time,
and trouble, to the exposure of these malpractices. They lie at the
bottom of the dissatisfaction that now finds expression in the doubt-
ful substitution of asphalte and costly wood, for cheap, durable,
and useful Macadam. They are one main cause of the burden of

Harmony hath been drawn from jangling anpils,
And shall not nagging Nations yield,
Spite of the sneer of Cynic BEACONSFIELD,
To Music's soft compulsion,
And the mild Magic, bland as an emulsion,
Of the smooth baton-wielder, calmly sure
Of the success of his new Overture ?
What passions cannot mighty Music quell?

And if that tiresome turban'd cymbal-clasher

On sounding brass inopportunely, he

But hushed is her anger,

Of the loud Russian drum,

Prejudiced ears perchance false notes discover,
But Peace's hopefal lover

What human voice can reach,
That deft first fiddle's praise ?
Notes inspiring perfect love,
Notes to make the nations raise
Harmonies worthy of the choir above!
GRANVILLE can tame to peace each warring race,
And keep each player in his place,
Sequacious of his wand :
At least that is the chief's serene and sure hope:
Shall we not hope that lately clashing Europe,
Will tune up sweetly at his mild command ?
Till Peace shall wave her olive-branch before us,
And all the Nations join with voice and hand,
In one sublime harmonious grand chorus!

MORE SEATS AND SHORTER HOURS.
Mr. Punch has, with much sympathy for the poor
sufferers, been studying, in his excellent contemporary
the Lancet, some very painful revelations of the treat-
ment of poor shop-girls, employed at the great Mercers',
and Linen-drapers', and other marts for the sale of
women's wares, or
wears," as the word should be spelt,
so as to include both the garments of Lady-customers and
the wear and tear of the shop-girls who serve them.
When the cracking of a joke is likely to help the re-
moval of an abuse, Mr. Punch is content to crack his
joke and await the results. But this subject of seats and
shorter hours for shop-girls, Mr. Punch feels to be quite
beyond a joke.
The thoughtlessness of the more or less fine Ladies-
they are all alike – who, by their patronage without
protest help
to keep alive what is at once a petty torture
on the strong, and a eat sanitary evil for the weak,
as well as the unfeeling greed of employers who sanc-
tion and superintend the torture, and perpetuate the
epil for their own benefit, lie out of the pale of Punch's
pleasantry. He can be angry over it, but not pleasant.
Public opinion has been directed to the matter.
Science has signalised the mischief, and insisted on a
remedy. A country where humanity interposes on be-
half of an over-driven cab-horse, will surely not go on
suffering hard-working, weak and defenceless girls to
be driven to death with impunity. It is only in a per-
centage of these shops that we come upon this inhuman
practice-over-driving young women, and not allowing
them the means of resting their weary limbs. Yes
there is one other place in which seats are not allowed.
That is the House of Commons, but there the torture is
only inflicted on one-half of the Members. In houses of
business the better class of employers repudiate such
stupid and short-sighted inhumanity. Let the public,
the Ladies in particular, look out for the shops in which
these practices do not prevail, and confine their patron-
age to them. In this way even the most unfeeling
employers would learn practically that humanity, like
honesty, is the best policy, and act upon the principle.

Sir H. WOLFF said that by common law an Atheist could
not take an oath ; and Mr. BRADLAUGH had avowed him-
self an Atheist. He moved, and Mr. FOWLER seconded,
that Mr. BRADLAUGH having claimed to affirm, on the
ground that the oath was not binding on his conscience,
ought not now to be allowed to take it.
Mr. GLADSTONE reminded the House that this was a
judicial question. A Select Committee was the proper tri-
bunal to consider if the House had the power now claimed.
And then the House proceeded to show by a heated
interchange of strong, opinions that it was ominently

it was a binding instrument, and must be maturely con-
sidered, with a view to the harmony of the European

WHICH is the day that should be blest,
And to the weary, work-opprest,
Bring wholesome pleasure, peace, and rest?
Õur Sunday.
Yet which the day of all the seven
To our sour lives adds sourer leaven,
And leaves poor folk most far from heaven?
Our Sunday,
When gutter-brats of tender years,
What filled our childish souls with fears
Of father's curses, mother's tears?
Our Sunday.
What makes the sound of prayer and praise,
Heard 'mid our foul and filthy ways,
Like echoes of an empty phrase ?
Our Sunday!
What day down East, --- where day's half night,
While West-End wealth enjoys the light,
Most feeds the public's frowze and fight?
Our Sunday !
What, when the week's toil stills its din,
Proclaims each simple pleasure sin,
And, preaching grace, provideth gin?
Our Sunday!
What, when we strive up from our sink,
Our souls with nobler things to link,
Bars all,—but one bar labelled drink?
Our Sunday!
And, when of this world we are clear,
What is it, in another sphere,
Won't be flung at us, as 'twas here?
Our Sunday!

Behold the Phylloxera preys,

And so precludeth wine.

Potatoes; strange to think,
Because they yield men food, and not

A two-fold plague doth smite,
The which is wondrous in our eyes-

Exempt from canker, free
From every kind of insect foes ;
As healthy as can be.
No fungus with disease can strike
That plant, no pest annoys;
No Colorado Beetle's like

Though physic we should lose thereby,
And likewise revenue !

After much speaking on the Report on the Budget
Resolutions, they were read a Second Time; and the
Budget budged on.
Mr. ARTHUR ARNOLD, in a maiden speech on the Relief
of Distress (Ireland) Act (1880) Amendment Bill, moved
by Lord FREDERICK CAVENDISH, protested against that
measure as a Bill for the Relief of Irish Landlords merely,
and an acceptance of the policy of the late Government.
Of course if they accept their predecessors' Act, they, as
it were, endorse their Bill. Mr. ARNOLD pitched 80
strongly into the ex-Ministerial Measure, as well as its
Ministerial modification before the House, as to call up
Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE in reply.
(Evening.)-The whole sitting, after some perfunctory
business, from an early hour in the evening till one
o'clock in the morning, wasted in a row, occasioned
primarily by Mr. O'DONNELL, persisting in putting ques-
tions involving gross imputations upon M. CHALLEMEL-
LACOUR, the new French Ambassador, although Sir
CHARLES DILKE had fully contradicted them, and secon-
darily by Mr. GLADSTONE, in a fit of natural impatience,
moving that Mr. O'DONNELL be not heard. This was
objected to as interference with the liberty of the House
by a good many Members, besides Home-Rulers, with
whom even Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE sided, and so,
stranger still, "did Mr. COURTNEY and Mr. ANDERSON.
Cries of “Divide! ' "Withdraw!” and, from the
Legislative Irishry, of "Despotism," and "Cæsarism,”
constituted the most remarkable, if not important utter-

taking occasion to interrupt Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT in
the middle of a vehement speech, by moving, en revanche,
