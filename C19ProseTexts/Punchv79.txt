PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

«' ~f TTELL," said the Great Philosopher, Poet, and Politician of the Age, addressing his Vititors, as the fire shot up on the
VY Christinas hearth into a cheery blaze, " I "m delighted to see you—delighted. And how well you are all looking!
Positively flourishing!"
"Not more flourishing than yourself," rejoined the three, in the same breath, with a most gracious bow.
The Sage smiled benignly. Then he turned his eye on the Griffin, who was wanning himself on the rug.
"And who brought in this?" he asked, surveying the peculiar creature with puzzled interest.
The three Visitors looked inquiringly at each other.
"I took it," said the Earl, after a short pause, "for a new species of domestic cat, introduced, so I had imagined, by
my enterprising and enthusiastic friend here, as the latest surprise for us from Eastern Europe." He gave a courteous
inclination of his head in the direction of the PBEMIEE as he spoke.
"No, no!" rejoined the PREMIER, holding out his hand deprecatingly, "I cannot claim the honour. Though," he
continued, "had I the leisure, I have no doubt but that I should find a study of the extinct fauna of the Slavonic, or even
of the Semitic principalities, a highly interesting and remunerative labour."
"Quite so," rejoined the Sage, with tact, nodding approvingly. "Yet extinction presupposes existence. Now, here
we have, I fancy, the product of grotesque fiction. A regular jumble of head and tail; eh, my Lord?"
The Earl smiled subacidly, and shook his head. "Your philosophic novelist, Mr. PUKCH," he rejoined, " deals only
with fact. Fiction is the heritage of the Poet. I disclaim the brute; but why shouldn't he belong to the Laureate?"
There was a laugh, in which the Griffin seemed inclined to join; but TOBY kept his eye on him in a business-like
manner, and he looked serious.
"He has been a good deal out in the cold lately," whispered the Discreet Dog.
"Very well then," replied the August Master of the House. "Let him stay there. We '11 warm him! And now,
My Lord and Gentlemen," he continued, courteously handing round a box of his own Magnanimot, " Let's have a look at the
presents."
There was a pleasant rustling of silver paper, and the Christmas gifts were disclosed.
"Place aux Pairs I" cried the Sage. "We '11 take you, My Lord, first. What has my Indefatigable Earl provided
forme?"
"An extremely readable novel in three volumes," was the complacent reply; "and allow me, MB. PUNCH, to enjoy
the notable privilege of presenting you with them all."
The Distinguished Author handed over his work. "You must regard the spirit of the giver, not the value of the gift,"
he said with prudent politeness. "Indeed, I am informed that, at the present moment, the whole thing is to be purchased
throughout the length and breadth of the United States of America, for as small a sum as fifteen cents."

"Griffin's valuation," growled the peculiar animal on the hearthrug.
"You don't say so!" replied the Sage, calculating. "Threes into fifteen—why, bless me—that's two pence half-
penny a volume! What a coincidence!"
The Laureate stopped forwards. "Ballads ami other Poems," he said, disclosing the familiar green cloth binding,
"just a few; and, no doubt you will have seen most of them before."
"And none the less welcome on tliat account," rejoined the Sage brightly; and then, as if an afterthought had occurred
to him, he added, "No Stage-plays among 'em, I hope?"
The Poet hesitated and coloured. "No, not among those," he said. "But—I have something in hand," he
continued, dropping his voice with confidential modesty.
"So I heard," responded the Sage. "And if you '11 follow my advico, you '11 stick to
"But there 1—I won't say anything;
I '11 only hope a let will fall
At last—somehow—to every stall,
And all the business take a spring!"
He shook the Ambitious Minstrel kindly by the hand; and then he turned to the PBEMTER. "And now, what have
you got for me ?" he a*ked, with evident interest.
The distinguished Statesman drew a roll of foolscap from his pocket. "This is the diaft of our great Irish Measure,"
he said. "Shall I read it to you?"
He began to unfasten it. There was an uncomfortable look on the face of everyone. Even the Griffin winced. The
Diplomatic Sage interposed.
"Shan't we have enough of politics the week after next?" he suggested, with a dignified wink.
"Well then, I might read a portion perhaps?" continued the PREMIER, still inspecting the string.
"What! and give us a half measure? That 'II never do !" said the Earl.
"It's an excellent document," continued the PREMIER.
"I 'm quite sure of that," answered the Sage. "But," he added, reflectively, " anyhow, suppose we keep it for the
Sixth?" As he spoke, ho approached a jewelled bureau of remarkable workmanship.
"Very well; for the Sixth!" echoed the PBEMIER, refastening his papers. "The date on which we shall meet our
friends!"
"And our enenres!" threw in the Earl.
"Ccrae, come, Gentlemen !" cried the Sago, who had taken from the jewelled bureau some costly article that ho was
endeavouring to conceal. "Come, come! We 're all friends here. And this is Christmas-time. So now prepare yourselves;
for you haven't yet had my present. I 've something for you, the very sight of which will make you give three cheers on the
spot", and shake hands all round. Now then!"
There was a moment of intense excitement. And then with a nimble leap, ME. PUNCH sprang on to the table, and,
standing on one leg, held out his gift.
"Take it!" he said. "It is

But, no. Mr. Punch will stop here. A young girl of eighteen,
broken in health, with all her powers impaired for life, dragging out
a weary existence in an invalid's room, is sad material to work with.

very seriously to concern.

mover of this proposal is reputed a Liberal; the seconder a
Conservative; he ought to he something more—a representative
of the hierarchy and the 'squirearchy, and an extreme Sab-
batarian to boot. Amendment in slight mitigation of absolute
Sabbatarianism msved by Mr. PEASE; publichouses to "be open for
a certain time on Sundays for the sale of beer to be consumed off the
premises, with special regulations for the metropolis." This modifi-
cation of a menace to prohibit the sale of food and drink by shutting
up restaurants and refreshments altogether, -was agreed to without a
division! But not without remark. Sir WILLIAM: HARCOUBT pointed
out that it was totally opposed to the Local Option Resolution carried
the other evening.
It threatens to etose all manner of publichouses without the
allowance of any Option whatever.
Sir RICHARD CROSS thought it was impossible to legislate in
advance of public opinion, and it would be impossible to enforce
such a measure if passed to-morrow. "Certainly in the Metropolis
no Secretary of State could be responsible for the peace if all the
pnblichouses were closed throughout Sunday."
Take care, Sabbatarians. Teetotallers, draw it mild. Paternal
legislators, forbear!
As yet, the comfort, enjoyment, and accommodation of the
lodger, and the wayfarer on Sunday, remain imperilled by nothing
worse than a puritanical abstract Resolution. The last House of
Commons was called a Publican's Parliament. Which is the better,
a Publican's or a Puritan's Parliament?
Monday (Lordt).—Some Bills having been advanced a stage,
Lord SYDNEY brought down the QUEEN s reply to the Address of
their Lordships' House praying for the omission of the fourth
schedule from the new Education Code. It graciously promised
that the matter should be carefully considered by the Committee of
Council.
(Commons.)—Questions over, Mr. GLADSTONE gave notice that he
would on Thursday move a Resolution declaring that every person
returned as a Member of the House of Commons who may claim to
be a person for the time being by law permitted to make a solemn
affirmation instead of taking an oath, shall henceforth—notwith-
standing so muoh of the Resolution adopted by the House on June 22
as related to affirmation—be permitted without question to make and
subscribe a solemn affirmation in the form prescribed bjr the Parlia-
mentary Oaths Act of 1<SG6, as amended by the Promissory Oaths
Act of 1H68, subject to any liability by statute. He would also
move to make that a Standing Order. This statement was so satis-
factory to Mr. LABOUCHERE, that he forthwith announced that he
would withdraw his own Resolution inviting the House to eat its
recent anti-Bradlaugh vote.
In answer to Messrs. SAITUELSON and BBOAD HURST, Mr. MUN-
DELLA declared that there was no intention to cut down the standard
of elementary education. A few hours previously. Lord SYDNEY, in
Another Place, had made an announcement, which see above. Had
the matter in question been carefully considered by the Committee
of Council in the meanwhile?
The House went into Committee of Supply on the Naval Esti-
mates, despatched details, and adjourned.
Tuesday (Lordt),—Royal Assent given by Commission to divers
Bills, and sundry others advanced a stage. Lord BEAT/CHAMP,
Chairman of the Select Committee on Reporting in their Lord-
ships' House, called attention to the report thereon. The reporting
was unsatisfactory. Why? First, noble Lords did not always
speak out. Next, very often, whilst a noble Lord was addressing
the House, there were several other noble Lords talking to one
another out loud.
Imagine any noble Lord so far forgetting himself! It is enough
to make anybody quote SHAKSPEAKE, and cry with Woltey—
"If I blush,
It ia, to see a nobleman want manners."
Lastly, Lord BEAUCHAMP said the acoustic properties of the House
were defective. To remedy these defects, he proposed three Resolu-
tions: two (the second and third) providing improved accommoda-
tion for reporters; the other (the nrst), with a view to make noble
Lords, in speaking, face the reporters' gallery, going to the tremen-

A popular demonstration was prepared
for Your Representative on quitting the
Academy, which, however, he modestly
avoided by pretending to be somebody else,
having previously ordered the splendidly-
liveried servants not to touch their hats on
seeing him. It was not until a late hour,
or rather an early one, that the last man of
the crowd outside dispersed himself, and
this only on the positive assurance of In-
spector SMUGGINS that Your Representative
had long since quitted the halls of dazzling

dous length of actually proposing that, from the week beginning the 5th of July,
the Woolsack should be placed at the north end of the House, so that the LORD
CHANCELLOR should sit with his face instead of his back to it 1
The bare idea of this hitherto unheard-of, and unimagined. this wild, fearful,
and reckless, not to say revolutionary innovation, liorrilirtl the House, and! the
proposal of it was of course withdrawn. Shunt the Woolsack! Had the
suggestion of such an enormity been entertained in the Honse of Lords for a
moment, there would have been an end of everything. Treat the Woolsack as
a moveable! The Roman Senate would as soon have thought of displacing the
CapitoK immobile taxum.
The other two Resolutions were agreed to without a division, and their
Lordships presently adjourned.
(Commons.)—Sir 8. NORTHCOTE gave notice of moving, as an Amendment to
Mr. GLADSTONE'S Motion on the Bradlaugh mess, a counter-Resolution declaring
that the House cannot consent to regale itself on its own recent vote.
Proposed declaration of nun possumus cheered by the Opposition.
Mr. (JOUST also gave notice that he would ask the SPEAKER, as a point of
order, whether, as virtually raising a question which the House has already
decided in the current Session, such a Resolution can be put at all?
Adjourned debate on Confiscatory Compensation of Disturbance (Hibernian)
Bill resumed, and by-and-by adjourned again; sitting suspended at seven till
nine, when Mr. D. O'CoNOR beginning to talk about the disfranchisement of
Sligo, the House was counted out in ten minutes' time.
Wednesday (Comment).—The House resolved itself into a sort of legislative
Eisteddfodd. Mr. ROBERTS moved the Sale of Intoxicating Liquors on Sunday
(Wales) Bill for totally closing all the publichouses on Sunday throughout the
Principality. Another Sabbatarian project, look yon.
If, said the Member for Flint, the Government, in the debate of last Friday,
had promised a Sunday Closing Bill for England and Wales, he would not
have pressed his own. There was a strong and almost unanimous feeling in
Wales in favour of closing publichouses on Sunday.
That is to say, the Cymry desire to be once a week deprived of their crw.
Mr. WARTON, in moving the rejection of the Bill, very naturally asked—" If
the working classes of Wales were so anxious not to visit publichouses on
Sunday, why did they do it?" The only possible answer, if that is indeed
so, is that they are so extremely imbecile as to be incapable of self-control.
Mr. A. PEEL, speaking from the Treasury Bench, having remarked that he was
practically addressing a Welsh Parliament, pointed out to Sabbatarian legisla-
tors that it would not do to go beyond public opinion, and that the PREMIER
had promised legislation on the licensing question with which the measure
before the House would interfere. There was a Welsh consensus in favour of
that measure which he did not like to resist. He couldn't support the Bill, and
wouldn't oppose it.
Amendment negatived. Welsh Sabbatarian Bill read a Second Time. If
publichouses are to be closed throughout Sunday in Wales, surely dairies will be
allowed to remain open, so that poor little TAFFY may at least be enabled to
quench his thirst with the milk which is good for babes.
Mr. LITTOX put his oar into Irish Land Legislation by moving the Second
Reading of his Fixity of Tenure Bill, which of course brought him into a fix with
Mr. FORSTER, who, as might have been expected, moved the previous question—
carried by 187 to 45. Shut up.
Thursday (Lords).—Lord GALLOWAY again brought the subject of the Mar
Peerage before the House, moving a Resolution to rescind an Order of their
Lordships relative thereto. Amendment moved by Lord REDESDALE, and, after
a long discussion, the Mar Motion rejected. "All that's spoke is marr'd."
(Commons.)—Final stage, we may hope, of the Bradlaugh bore. After
preliminary business, of small account, Mr. SPEAKER, in reply to Mr. GORST,
ruled that there was an essential difference between Mr. GLADSTONE'S Resolu-
tion and Mr. LABOUCHERE'S, and that the former could therefore be moved, in
order.
Mr. GLADSTONE thereupon proceeded to move his Resolution, rescinding the
previous Resolution which excluded Mr. BRADLAUGH, and in support of his
Motion especially urged the necessity of protecting the dignity of the House and
maintaining its police. The decency of the House had only been maintained by
Mr. BRADLAUGH being made aware that such a Motion as this would be made;
and but for that knowledge there would have been a repetition of the painfui
scenes of last week.
In point of fact, if the House did not accede to the Motion, its dignity and
order would remain at the mercy of Mr. BRADLAUGH.
Partly impressed perhaps by this consideration, but rather, of course, with
a sense of the necessity of getting out of an untenable position, the House, in
spite of forcible speeches from Sir S. NORTHCOTE and Sir R. CROSS, and impas-
sioned protests from Mr. SULLIVAN and other Roman Catholic Members, finally
adopted Mr. GLADSTONE'S proposal, and by a majority of 303 to 249 con-
sented to devour its previous decision, amid much cheering from the Ministe-
rial benches. It then rejected a rider proposed by Mr. SULLIVAN, which would
have excluded BRADLAUGH personally, and having agreed on the Motion of
Mr. GLADSTONE to make the Resolution of which Mr. BRADLAUGH was the hero,
and has thus become master of the situation, a standing order, adjourned.

Hail, Fashion's

From galling bonds

So, when her tyrant

A frightful cage

We 've uttered no

But borne it with a
Spartan grin.
And when Unreason's hand has tied
Soft sinuous forms in bands of steel
That marred their gracious lines, we 've sighed,
But scorned to utter what we feel.
Yet later, when in clinging fold
She swathed and cramped each pliant frame,
And tacked to Nature's perfect mould
An irksome tail to trip and lame—
E 'en then we 've smiled a patient smile,
And wondered at such needless pains;
Still keeping wary watch the while,
Lest, stumbling, we might curse their trains.
For all too oft the

When, tripping in

A crash has made

And your own forms are quite enough,

Without all this pernicious, stuff.
So, when the future ages scan
The page of Fashion's folly dense,
They shall confess this year began
An era of sound Common Sense!

Since the first rose-leaves fell on the first river,
In distant Aidenn?
Enough to put a Poet in a passion,
To think of Flora as a thrall to Fashion,
Like any modish maiden!
July is with us, her green lap full laden
With old-world flowers
(A little colour-dimmed by drenching- showers),
And. though aesthetic prigs turn up their noses
At things BO commonplace as Cabbage roses,
Larkspurs, and Lilies,
Thank Heaven, we 're not yet swayed by sumphs and sillies,
And their vague talk of amaranth, rue, and moly,
So wholly
That we 're too proud to take a simple pleasure
In the old cottage garden's common treasure.
Flowers fashionable now? Ah! very probable.
Flora is much beholden to Le Pallet!
And yet 'tis rather jolly
To think her ancient treasuries are not robbable,
That Fashion, smile or frown she on the flowers,
Can't change the cut or trim in fields and bowers;
Or rule fair May as she hath ruled Mayfair,
The rose's petal petticoats make spare,
As eel-skin dresses,
Or puff the lily-skirts with crinoline,
Of dim to dingy bronze the grass's green,
Or geometrioiie the honeysuckle.
Wherefore one blesses
The kindly fates that, though Society truckle
To the queer whims of modish mutability,
Nature knows nothing of such poor servility.
None of the fturat-clique't aesthetic crazes
Affect the secular buttercups and daisies;
The ecstasy of the Intense that fills
Dolldom's weak heart moves not the daffodils;
No High Art prank
Will make the violet pallid, gawky, lank.
'Tis doubtless true,—tette the smart Scribe's comment,
That, for the moment,
Fashion for Flora feigns a passing passion.
But Flora follows not the lead of Fashion!
Good Omen.
THE telegrams announced last week that, on the KHEDIVE'S
affairs—
"The British Government has notified its acquiescence in the appointment
of Mr. ALU.V/U MONEY us Engliih Member of toe Coisse of Public Debt."
This is a good omen for the KHEDIVE. A first instalment of
English Money. There "s only one difficulty, this Money can't be
changed without the consent of the British Government, and when
changed this Money will be lost. The KHEDIVE was delighted to
hear that, on being asked whether he would accept the post, Mr.
MONEY replied, "Ready, aye Ready! "—an excellent motto for
Money generally.
A Vulgar Error.
THE institution of Sunday Schools having attained to its hundredth
year, and been therefore celebrated, and had its celebration reported,
as that of the " Sunday School Centenary "—this last word not being
understanded of the people as generally as their friends would wish
—has greatly exereuea some persons phonetically but perversely
disposed as to spelling, accustomed to drop their aitches, and not
well up in hagiology. Endowed with inquiring, though unculti-
vated minds, they go about asking whether by the Centenary of
Sunday Schools is meant their Founder; and if he was a Saint,
whom, meaning to name St. HKNBY, they call St. KNNKUY.

LAW IN THE PADDYLAND OF THE FUTURE.
(From Mr. Punch's Prophetic Reporter.)
The Seat of War, Augutt, 188—.
HK long-expected hostilities
between Mr. O'PAYNOUGHT
and The RAGSANDTATTERSOON
have at last commenced in
earnest. The latter is theore-
tically the aggressor, although
the former seems to be acting
in rather an overbearing man-
ner. The story of the dispute
out of which the proceedings
have grown is briefly as fol-
lows :—
A short time since The RAO-
SANDTATTERSOOIf (who is
ground|landlordto Mr. O'PAY-
N OUGHT) called upon his
tenant to ask for his rent,
•which had been overdue for
a long period of years. So
unlooked-for, not to say super-
fluous, an action naturally
provoked the greatest indig-
nation amongst the O'PAY-
NOUGHTS, and the visitor was
received with howls of the
most vigorous execration. Had
not the occasion been one of
a purely peaceable character
(a meeting of Mr. O'PAY-
NOUGHT'S family to celebrate'the birthday of one of their number),
it is more than probable that, The RAGSANDTATTERSOON might have
received some rough treatment. As it was, he was forcibly ejected
by two powdered footmen acting under the orders of the assistant-
butler, and furthermore was pelted with empty champagne bottles
as he ran through his tenant's costly flower-garden on his way
home. Provoked (not unnaturally) by the rather inhospitable
manner in which he had been received, The RAGSANDTATTERSOOS
distinctly placed himself in the wrong by kicking a valued friend of
Mr. O'PAYNOUGHT in the character of a highly respected pig. This
harmless animal was quietly engaged in discussing a luscious mess
of chicken, pate de foie grat, and maraschino jelly swimming in a
dish of strawberries and cream, when, in more senses than one, the
luckless landlord fell upon him. It is said by some that in the
hurry of his flight The RAGSANDTATTERSOOIT did not see the intelli-
gent quadruped, and that the insult offered to him consequently was
purely accidental. This is stoutly denied by the O'PAYNOUOHTS, who
declare that the assault was nothing short of an infringement of the
new Act. It is contended that The RAGSANDTATTERSOOW wished
to eject his tenant by using violence to the pet pig. Acting upon
this construction of the proceeding, Mr. O'PAYNOUGHT commenced
an action for damages against his landlord, and the matter had to be
decided as the law directs by the Judge of the local County Court.
Early in the morning of the day of trial, The RAGSANDTA:TTERSOON
(who happens to be a member of the Society of Friends) presented
himself before the Judge, and on his knees entreated his Honour to
give the case against nim. He repeated over and over again that
he would far rather make any sacrifice than that bloodshed
should be the outcome of the contest. Mr. Justice 0'WHISKY (who
appeared to be moved almost to tears by the suitor's generosity)
replied that he was obliged to obey the dictates of his conscience,
and that therefore he must give a decision against Mr. O'PAY-
NOUGHT'S pretensions. To comfort his visitor, however, he showed
that the Court-House had been put in a thorough state of defence,
and that the Bench itself, by means of sandbags and small pieces of
artillery, had been very carefully protected. Adding frequently
that it "would be all right," the gallant Judge then retired to his
private room to await contingencies.
At exactly a quarter past twelve the O'PAYNOUGHT family ap-
proached, and deployed into line. The Clerks of the County Court,
headed by their intrepid chief, immediately appeared on the walls,
and challenged the plaintiffs to commence the action. Upon this,
the counsel learned in the law engaged by Mr. O'PAYNOUGHT, wear-
ing his wig and gown, and waving a flag of truce (a white pocket-
handkerchief attached to a walking-stick) advanced and asked for a
parley. This was accorded, and it was explained to his Honour that
in the event of his giving a decision adverse to the interests of Mr.
O'PAYICOTOHT, an appeal against the Court would be conducted in the
customary manner. The Judge gallantly announced his opinion
that the Defendant was entirely in the right, and bobbed down his
head just in time to escape the very unpleasant consequences follow-
ing upon so bold a declaration.
Mr. O'PAYNOUGHT'S attack upon the strongly fortified Court-
House was of a most determined character. Thousands of bullets,
stones, and other missiles were expended in the advance; and, after
an hour's desperate fighting, the position was turned, with the com-
paratively small loss of one maiden aunt killed and two first cousins
twice removed slightly wounded. The shouts of triumph were soon
exchanged, however, for howls of disappointment when it was dis-
covered that his Honour had abandoned the Court-House shortly
before its capture, and was still holding out in a scientifically
defended laundry and wash-house.
This despatch leaves the Judge the master of the situation.
A. week later.
His Honour for the last seven days has been undergoing all the
horrors of a siege. The outhouse is surrounded, and supplies have
been completely cut off. The garrison are known to be living on old
summonses. His Honour is expected to revise his decision before
his appointment is rendered vacant by a death from hunger.
Latest.
The Family have conquered I The decision has been revised, and
Mr. O'PAYNOUGHT is at this moment spending a small fortune upon
a grand alfretco fete, race meeting, and regatta in celebration of his
victory. In the fulness of his heart the triumphant tenant has
invited the defeated landlord to be present at the rejoicings. The
RAGSANDTATTERSOON, however, has been unable to accept the kind
invitation, because he has had a pressing appointment elsewhere—in
point of fact, in the Court of Bankruptcy!
WHAT WE MAY COME TO.
M K unr.K with the Woolsack, and with alarming rapidity the country
would see changes of the most revolutionary character introduced
into both Houses of Parliament! Are we prepared to stand by and
calmly witness such startling innovations in the Constitution as are
implied by new Standing Orders (like those we now publish), which
we distinctly warn an apathetic public, are certain in time to
be adopted, if the Woolsack is moved but a handsbreadth from its
present time-honoured position f

own or his wif e s relations.
During the summer months the Woolsack and the Chair to be

CHAPTER VI.
Two DAZED IN TOWN.
TJRING the scene re-
corded in the previous
chapter Mr. SIMPLEB
had quietly sneaked—
sneaked, I regret to
say, is the word—up
to town, with several
cards in his pocket, on
which he had taken
care to inscribe, by
way of introducing
himself everywhere as
a public character,
"Rev. S. SIMPLEB,
Bedell of Small-
Beerjester, Co-
Despondent in the case
of Bounce v. the Card-
sharpers of Beerjester
and Others;" his ob-
ject in writing
"Despondent" being
to excite the sympathy
of Sir ISAAC ALLPHXEZE, and obtain from him a private opinion gratis, which
would at once decide his movements with regard to JOHN BOUNCE on the one
hand, and the Bishop and Arohbeaoon on the other.
Mr. SIMON SIMPLEB, Beadle of Small-Beerjester, who, as my readers may
not need to be reminded, is also Percenter anrf Precentor, and therefore a
Reverend in his own rite, found himself in London at his own expense.
Being in want of rooms in the Metropolis, he took up Chambers's Journal,
and having made his selection from a good number of Chambers, he drove
at once to the Clargey's Hotel, in darkey's Street, Pickadowndilly, where
the head-waiter at once recognised the Master of Deedler's Trust as a patron,
brought him a sherry and bitters and a biscuit, a telegram with latest betting
at Newmarket, and then retired to order his room.
The Reverend Beadle's, or Bedell's, as he preferred to call himself in London,
first visit was to the Angel at Islington, where he was welcomed by the angelic
hostess and provided with an excellent dinner. After this, it being too early to
call on Sir ISAAC, he strolled to Sadler's Wells, drank the invigorating waters
which still retain a strong taste of leather about them, and then bethought him
that a more unprofitable hour might be passed elsewhere than at the Zoological
Gardens, to which place of recreation and animal spirits he forthwith bent his
steps. Here he showed three of his cards at the entrance, but, as the Gate-
keeper is always the sharpest of all the Keepers at the. Zoological, who are all
well up in games of four-feet, he was unable to induce him to name the wrong
one, so paid his and money went in.
Meeting some children with pennies in their hands, he took them to a refresh-
ment stall and bought some beautiful stale penny buns at half-price, which he
let the children have at three for twopence or four for threepence, and so, on
the whole, made a good thing of it, not only recouping himself for his expendi-
ture ef gate-money, but also getting something for himself and fourpence clear
profit, which he spent in a nde on the Dromedary, a sensation that gave him
great pleasure, as being the next thing to riding on a Prebendary.
After this he took a cab as far as KiTBLm's, the well-known hair-dresser, hat-
brusher, find umbrella-seller, in Bill Street, whose shop has a back exit into
the Girlington Arcade, through which Mr. SIMTLEB passed after informing one
of the young men that lie would look in again to see some back hair-pins, and
thence strolled leisurely towards the Park. Here, seeing the row filled with
equestrians, he sauntered as far as a neighbouring livery stable in Mount Street,
and having hired a neat cob for a couple of hours, he joined the gay throng
and at the expiration of an hour and halt he rode out of the Park and dismounted
before the portico of a princely mansion opposite the Bnswater corner of Ken-
sington Gardens.
Here a ragged individual, fancying that he had overheard the Master of

Deedler's lamenting the absence of his groom, proffered
his services in taking the horse home.
Mr. SIMPLEB confided the animal to his care, writing
on one side of one of his blank cards the address of the
livery stable in Mount Street, and on the other "Returned
with thanks. Please give bearer something for himself,"
further instructing the man that should he not be re-
warded for his trouble, he must come back, knock at the
door at which he was then standing, and the butler would
then settle with him as he at the present moment had no
change. The man touched his cap to Mr. SIMPLER, and
when he and the horse were quite out of sight, the worthy
Bedell rang the bell, but on being informed that "Mr.
FEBGUSON, for whom he had inquired, "did not lodge
there," he apologised for his mistake, and having hailed
a cab, he bargained with the driver to take him three
miles for a shilling.
On arriving at the Description Hall, Pickadowndilly,
he stopped the driver and pretended that it was against
his conscience to go any farther; whereupon the driver
asked him for money which the Bedell flatly refused to
pay him. The Cabman insisted on driving him to the
Attorney-General's chambers, as Sir ISAAC ALLPHEEZE
was known to be favourable to all growlers with a
grievance, and his opinion, invariably accepted as final,
should be paid for by the loser; to which unexpected
suggestion the Master of Deedler's acceded conditionally
on the driver's promising to wait and bring him back
to the Description Hall free of charge.
Sir ISAAC ALLPHEEZE was in; in fact, as his clerk said,
with regard to opinions he was never known to be out;
if ever ne did happen to be out in his opinion, it was
only when he was not at home in a case. At the present
moment, however, he was engaged on the Great Stair
case in Westminster Hall, and he would run round and
fetch him immediately. _ The clerk was as good and
better than his word, as in less than five minutes they
were ushered into the innermost room which, hung round
as it was with legal instruments, and ornamented with
habeas corpuses stuffed, and framed illustrations of legal
fictions, produced a considerable effect on the Cabman's
mind.
Sir ISAAC, who, in his full Attorney-General's uniform,
wig, cooked-hat, robes, Jack-boots, spurs, sabretache,
and sword, was standing on the hearth-rug, appeared
delighted at seeing the Master of Deedler's, and at once
wrote his decision, to the effect that in the case of Cab-
man v. Simpler (Clerk in Orders), "the Plaintiff had no
claim against Defendant, inasmuch as the former had
agreed to an essentially illegal contract; a shilling, and
nothing less, being the only legal tender for any distance
of two miles and under."
For this decision, the Plaintiff had to pay immediately
the sum of one guinea, Sir ISAAC being specially retained,
or a warrant of distress would be then and there issued,
and five shillings more to Defendant to stay further
proceedings as to the second illegal contract into
which the Cabman had entered to take him back to the
Description Hall gratis.
The Cabman having settled the above charges, with
tears in his eyes, thanked Sir ISAAC, and withdrew, leav-
ing the worthy Attorney and the Master of Deedler's in
consultation on far more serious matters than a mere
Cabman.
Sir ISAAC is a long, lank, thin man—so long and so thin,
that the proverbial longest day could not be enough for
him to stand up in, and he must have an entire long
Vacation all to himself to lie down in. He was long alto-
gether; he had been long out of office; he had been long
in office; he was long-winded, long-sighted, long-suffer-
ing, and of long standing in his profession; he was long
in getting whatever he longed for, but he was a man
who could go any lengths to get it. When at the
University he showed a taste for Latin poetry, but they
were all hexameters, all "longs." If he ever dined away
from home, my readers can imagine to what hotel in
Bond Street he gave the preference; and when he took
a long holiday abroad, it was Toolong where he always
stayed. He was bound to live long: to be long a-dying.
like the Merry Monarch; and to be long remembered
after his death, when his long life will be published by
LONGMAN & Co.
"The question is "began Mr. SIMFLEB, when Sir
ISAAC interrupted him.
"I know what the question is, what you don't know is
the answer."

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Percenter bowed assent and played an imaginarj
Jews' harp energetically with both hands.
"Now," continued the Attorney-General, putting his
finger to his nose, "I '11 give you the straight tip."
The Percenter bowed again and thought that Sir ISAAC'S
tip couldn't be straighter than it was; he said nothing,
however, but only went on with his inaudible fantasia on
the old imaginary Jews' harp.
Sir ISAAC then declared that BOUNCE and FISHY were
worse than a couple of donkeys, as these animals were
quadrupeds, while the two enemies of Deedler's Trusts
hadn't literally a leg to stand upon between them.
Mr. SIMPLER, seated on his chair, began to play a quick
march on his imaginary instrument.
"Moreover, my dear Sir," continued the Attorney-
General, " BOUNCE will have to pay his own costs Jand
ours." Here Mr. SIMPLER increased the time of his
march, which, inaudible to Sir ISAAC, began to sound
aloud, for him, notes of jubilant triumph, accompanied
by the beating of the drums in his own ears. "And what-
ever little honorarium has to be presented to me for my
opinion, will have to come out of the pockets of the
Archbeacon and the Bishop, as I am not legally "—he
emphasised the word—" entitled to receive any fee from
the Master of Deedler's, though, perhaps, some little
testimonial, such as a purseful of guineas, a richly-chased
drinking-cup, or a jewelled inkstand—with an ink-scrip-
tion on it—might not be out of place on my side-board,
or on my drawing-room table at home."
The latter part of Sir ISAAC'S speech was entirely
unheeded by Mr. SITIPLER, who was now standing up on
his chair, facing Sir ISAAC, and playing up, with both
hands, such a " See the Conquering Hero Comes" on the
imaginary Hebraic harp, accompanied by such a preter-
natural beating of inaudible ear-drums, and such a bold
and rapid blowing of nose-trumpets, as had never before
been performed in an Attorney-General's chambers out
of Hanwell or Colney Hatch.
"Hark!" cried the Percenter, stamping his foot, and
conducting his imaginary orchestra. Sir ISAAC listened,
and looked in wonder. Then he rang the bell violently,
previous to grasping the poker and the fire-shovel.
A Clerk opened the door, and in another moment the
Percenter had descended the stairs. Sir ISAAC had
sported his oak, in which he remained ensconced, like
CHARLES THE SECOND, for the rest of the day, and the
worthy Beadle-Peroentor-Master of Deedler's, beaming
with triumph, retraced his steps in the direction of
Pickadowndilly. He could scarcely believe his senses;
it seemed like some strange dream; he could not bring
himself to return to Beerjester immediately, until he
felt that he thoroughly comprehended the situation.
Had he made an enemy of Sir ISAAC? Had his harping
been premature? Sir ISAAC had not given him his
written opinion—might not this be different to what he
had spoken; and then what a figure he should out
when he re-visited Small-Beerjester, and had to humble
himself before JOHN BOUNCE and MORLEENA? And once
more he played the imaginary Hebraic harp, but this
time dejectedly, to the air of We May be Happy yet."
And so, still harping on his daughter, he entered the
Hall dedicated to St. James. Here he stood beyond the
ticket place and near the barrier, humbly informing the
attendant that he was waiting for a friend, whereupon
he was permitted to remain on this spot, where he was
able to hear the louder parts of the Christy's entertain-
ment for nothing.
Taking advantage of the temporary absence of the offi-
cial, who was called away by some disturbance in the
Gallery, he entered the room and seated himself in one of
the stalls.
He had always considered persons of all shades not
so black as they are painted, and here before him was an
instance in point. He had never seen so many people at
once looking so black, and they are all painted!
The Reverend Bedell had heard that " the Prince of
Darkness is a Gentleman," and it occurred to his child-
like mind that the black Indy-vidual at the corner in
full evening dress, with magnificent collars, diamond
Btuds-and an elegant shirt-frill, must be His Royal High-
ness Himself; so, before taking his seat, he bowed
politely to him, a salute which was most courteously
returned; a proceeding fortunately witnessed by the
official in charge of the Stalls, who. returning at
the moment was about to ask our excellent friend for
his ticket of admission, when he noted this public

recognition of the stranger accorded by the distinguished occupant of the corner
of the Stage.
Mr. SIMPLER listened with interest; their perfect harmony delighted his
inmost soul, and it was some consolation to his wounded clerical spirit to
remember that these men were living as a band of brothers united in one
uncommon object, and were known in all this troubled worldly city as the only
Christy 'uns. Their service came to an end, and Mr. SIMPLER quitted the Hall.
His eyes had become so accustomed to the darkness of the Minstrels' faces that
it was not until he had tried several " eye-openers" at the American bar of the
Hyperion that he was able to find his way to Westminster, where he was much
annoyed at being charged a shilling on entering the Abbey, and it was not until
he was informed that this included everything, and that the Famous Flying
Fandango was now going through her marvellous performance, that he awoke to
the fact of his having mistaken the Aquarium for the Abbey, and once more he
played the imaginary harp to the same tune with a different emphasis, the air
being " We may be Abbey yet."
Then the thought of the Attorney-General recurred to him, and he mechani-
cally sought the bar, where he requested to he served with a draught of anything
legal.
Then, as the clock struck nine, he looked in at the Podrida, in Molester
Square, where there was a brilliant spectacle going on, which soothed and
gratified him exceedingly. Thence he strolled towards EVINS'S, but not finding
it as soon as he had expected, he returned towards Pickadowndilly. and being
attacked by a cruel enemy called hunger, he made his way to the door of the
Poll Moll Restauwrong, wnere, having paid three shillings for his ticket, he
found himself in a brilliantly lighted saloon, crowded, as he could see at a
glance, by the elite of society. It seemed to the Master of Deedler's Trust
that in this gathering of aristocratic and distinguished persons, everyone
was affable and pleasant, no one haughty or proud; he was perpetually being
saluted and addressed in the friendliest and kindest manner possible by polite
persons of both sexes, with whose faces he was almost certain he was personally
unacquainted, though they one and all appeared to recognise him immediately.
How pleased MORLEENA would be, he thought, if she could be here, and see
him now! What a triumph for the Archbeacon and the Bishop that their cause
should be so popular in London, as was evident from the homage paid to
himself, who was only their humble representative and co-despondent; for,
evidently, such greetings as these were not accorded to him as a mere

tranger. Of ccrarse all the town had read the articles

crowd of Bank-holiday sight-seers over the Cathedral,

staff, and began laying about him like Punch in the
show, and then that some one shook him roughly by the
collar, and said, "Come, no more of this!" and .he
awoke to find himself held by two Policemen, and con-
fronted by an Inspector, while a third stood by, with his
helmet knocked in, and a black-eye, having, as he pro-
tested, been seriously "damaged by that Gent, there, -
pointing to the worthy Percenter, who had not as yel
recovered his faculties sufficiently to be able to reply to
the charge. Then he hears the Proprietor request pay-
ment from some one for the supper, and the broken glass
and the injury done to the reputation of his establishment
and on the Percenter indignantly turning fb inquire why
the people who gave the entertainment didn't reply, the
Proprietor observed that he didn't want to be triflec
with, and if he, the Percenter, couldn't pay the money
down, he must trouble him for his name and address
before he was taken off to the stationhouse.
Then the Master of Deedler's bethought him of hi;
friend, the Attorney-General, and producing a card re
quested the Inspector to send it at once to Sir ISAAI
ALLPHEEZE. At the mention of this name the Inspecto
suggested that he, the Proprietor, and the worthy Per
centor, should all go down to Sir ISAAC'S chambers it
a cab, and there being no objection to this proposal, •
was adopted.
Then, on Mr. SIMMER'S having endorsed the can
"Testimonial all right, splendid cup and inkstand wit!
inkscription," Sir ISAAC, without getting off the Wool
sack where he slept for practice, wrote a judgment in
the Master of Deedler's favour, threatening the pro
prietor with a prosecution and the withdrawal of hi
licence, and severely reprimanding the Inspector, wh
was ordered to see Mr. SIMPLER home and pay him
every possible attention.
The Master of Deedler's didn't get np till very lat
next morning, and then returned t>y evening train t

From the brine, or a mignonette-bed, or
from lilac-buds rain-washed at eve,
You are really quite out of the run-

Lake something solid and succulent, toothsome, and titillant. Dirt?
Hrumph! 'Tis a useful commodity; /never found it to hurt.
Dirt? What is dirt after all? A comparative thing I suppose,
What do punctilious bards use for growing their lily and rose?
Hate all such finicking fashions. The gushers would tiptoe through life
Like girls o'er a foul City crossing. Now, right realism is rife

But ZOLA, now! Ah! there'« a writer! I think, as I wallow and grunt,
That the learnedest Pig of us all need not deem it the slightest affront
To be dubbed Realistic Romancer. It sounds contradictory, too,
But the last avatar of romance is so nakedly, nastily true,

Nay, were sinners all stately of port, clean of linen, and dainty of taste,

As Property has its duties as well as its rights, so,
conversely, it has its rights as well as its duties.
The rights of Landed Property in general pertain to
the Landlord, but the rights of Irish Landed Property
are the rights of the Tenant, and resolve themselves alto-
gether into Tenant Right.
The Irish Landtord ought by rights to have no rights
whatever, but duties only.
His duties are his taxes, and the duty of contributing
to the relief of distress, and to all other works and
objects of benevolence, beneficence, and utility.
A "GENERAL" OBDEB.—" Abolish most of them."-
(Signed,) "G. 0. T."
THE NEXT VICTORY!
(A Sketch for the Historian of the Future.)
ALL apparently was lost. The Sub-Lieutenant in command (the
only British officer younir enough to perform the duties of a General)
was at his wits' end. The enemy had gained ground everywhere,
and the scattered battalions of Old England were gradually rallying
round their respective head-quarters—the Infants' Schools from
which they had drawn their recruits. Non-Commissioned Officers of
nearly two months' standing were taking their places in the junior
classes of the Educational Establishments just mentioned from force
of habit, and their " men" were crying as of old for the recently-
deserted sugarstick and the lately-relinquished box of bricks.
"What am I to do?" murmured the Sub-Lieutenant, as an aged
Captain from the List of Officers of the Reserve approached him.
"Half a century of service rather more passive than active has
rendered me a little rusty. I do not feel equal to giving you
advice."
This was said with a heavy sigh, and a moment later the elderly
speaker had succumbed to a dead faint, produced by the overwhelm-
ing weight of more than eighty years of comparative inaction.
"Let MS help you?"
It was a very faint whisper—the outcome of extreme old age. The
Sub-Lieutenant wavered. He had been addressed by an ancient
General, who, with some thousand colleagues senior to himself, were
gathered together in a group, seated in vehicles specially adapted to
mitigate the rigour of their infirmities.
''Tis the only chance," cried the young chieftain in command—
he was scarcely sixty. "'Tis the only chance! The Reserved
Reserve will advance! Quick march—double—charge!"
In a moment there was a general movement of Bath-chairs. The
strange battalion at an easy trot steadily pursued its way. Then
happened a remarkable occurrence. Th« enemy were completely
taken by surprise. Full of superstition, they regarded thi» unlooked-
for manosuvre as something supernatural. They were prepared to
meet men—or rather children—but not ghosts! As they saw the old
fogies coming towards them in their invalid carriages, they lost
heart. In a word, they uttered a piercing shriek of consternation,
and hurriedly retired. The retreat changed immediately into a rout.
The honour of England was saved! The battle had been won by
"Old PAHK'S Brigade!"
"General Officers and Honorary Colonels!" cried the now tri-
umphant Sub-Lieutenant to the venerable conquerors as they
leisurely returned and feebly produced ear-trumpets, so that they
might listen to their leader's complimentary harangue—" General
Officers and Honorary Colonels, I thank you! Inkermann has been
called 'the Soldiers' Battle,' but to-day shall be remembered—aye,
for ever—as the Victory of the Retired List!"
And so the fight ended. The Generals were wheeled back to their
respective Clubs, and the Sub-Lieutenant within five years wag
gazetted (out of his turn) to a company. This last step gave the
greatest possible satisfaction to the lucky Captain and his friends,
although causing—for awhile—a little heart-burning among the
hundreds of his seniors, who now perforce became his juniors. This
was natural enough, as the well-merited promotion produced stag-
nation in the British Army for several generations. But (as the
Press subsequently remarked) "What are private interests worth
when weighed in the scales with Pluck, Merit, and the Good of the
Public?"
To conclude. Shortly after the hero had received his reward, a family
group were assembled in the newly-furnished quarters that had been
given to him in recognition of his hardly-earned advancement.
"Nay, do not give me all the praise," said the successful tactician
to his grandchildren as they heartily congratulated him on his first
appearance in the uniform of a Junior Captain in a Marching Regi-
ment of the Line. "Do not give me all the praise. I owe my
present rank to the services of others. I should have lost the day
without the charge of the General Officers on the Retired List."
And the whole nation agre«d with him (at they settled with the
tax-collector) that the charge of the General Officers on th« Retired
Liit was a heavy one indeed!

A GREAT UNWASHED.
MB. KoKESTF.it, the other night, was very
anxious to know what the scaffolding at
the Clock Tower had cost, what it was for,
and when it would be down.
Mr. ADAMS, in giving him the informa-
tion he asktd for, said that the cost would
be £250, that the scaffolding would be down
this week, and that it had been put up for
the purpose of cleaning the outside of the
Clock—which tells to the eye what the
tongue of Big Ben proclaims to the ear—
the flight of time over the head of Parlia-
ment. When Mr. ADAMS added that this
is the first time the Clock has had its face
and hands washed since it was put up, he
stated what, in these sanitary days, should
have startled the House.
Is there any Westminster street-Arab in
so neglected a condition as to that cleanli-
ness which is next to godliness, as the Clock
to •which not only the Collective Wisdom
but the western portion of the Great Baby-
lon looks for the time of day?
Let us hope the hands of Parliament are
cleaner than those of its Clock, and that
such neat unwashedness is for the present
not allowed to penetrate farther than the
Clock Tower, where, en attendant, it may
be said to have had a recent representative
in. Mr, BKADLAUUU.

WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH IT?
DEAR MR. PUNCH,
IT has come at last, and from a very great distance. All have heard of it, read of
it, and many of us have dreaded to know more about it. It has been in print for an indefinite
time, but only within the last few days have certain personages, and those the highest in
the realm, received a proof of it. Long but a name in this country, it is now amongst us, a
splendid reality. It has appeared in the very last place where it might have been expected—
in the Court Circular. To prevent further suspense, be it known that Her Majesty the
QUEEF, and H.R.H. the Prince of WALES, are at this moment each the happy possessor of
a "White Elephant." FROM SIAM.
P.S.—Her MAJESTY and the Prince, after mature consideration, have decided not to send
their White Elephants to the Zoological Gardens, but to keep them in boxes, and occasion-
ally to show them in public.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

{PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
FRIDAY, July 2 (Lords).
—The subject of the Li-
censing Laws is too com-
plei for the Government to
tackle just now, " but they
hope at no very distant
date to submit a measure
correcting some of the chief
evils of the present system."
So much, in answer to in-
quiries from the Thane of
Fife, commonly called Earl
"of that ilk."
For the satisfaction of
the Duke of SOMERSET,
Lord KJMBERLEY said that
if Cyprus should he handed
over to the Colonial Office,
the mode in which it has
been acquired will not pre-
vent him, the Earl of K i u -
BEHLEY, from tryingtoform
a valuable possession of it,
or at least to make the best
of a bad bargain.
The Earl of NOBTHBKOOK
informed the Earl of RA-
VENSWOBTH that the Ad-
miralty had decided on
their shipbuilding programme for the year. Good, my Lords.
Their Lordships passed a few Bills of little or no remarkable con-
sequence to the community.
(Common*. Morning.)— Prayers; after which Mr. BRADLATTGU
walked in and took his affirmation and seat sub silentio.
Debate on an Amendment to the Employers' Liability Bill, moved
by Mr. MACDONALD in the interest of the Employed, and seconded
by Mr. INDERWICK. Time called, and Sitting suspended till
Evening, when Dr. CAMERON moved an Address to stay British
subjects from taking law into their own hands with uncivilised natives
after the manner imputed to some missionaries, particularly certain
"Blantyre Missionaries in Central Africa," wiio are reported to
have punished offending savages not only by flogging some of them,
but also by hanging others, to reclaim—not encourage—the rest. On
assurance from Sir CHARLES DILEE, upon the part of the Government,
that they wished to prevent such doings, the Doctor withdrew his
Motion.
Perhaps the Blantyre Missionaries have been belied by the wicked,
and are falsely accused of having "Lynched" or " Blantyred" the
heathen they could not convert.
Saturday (Commons).—Committee on Relief of Distress (Ireland)
Act Amendment Bill, and thereupon lengthy debate, chiefly financial,
in the course of which Mr. FOBSTER begged the Irish Members to get
on, for if the Bill were not finished that day, he could not be sure
when it would be brought on again. Nevertheless, Amendment and
Division followed and followed again and again; the talk went on,
and they kept it up from 13 at noon on Saturday to 12'30 Sunday
morning, when at length, on Motion of Mr. FORSIEB., the debate was
adjourned.
Sit dot qui citb dot; and, as Sancho Panza might add, whilst the
grass is growing the steed may starve. As is the growth of grass to
the sustenance of horses, so is that of potatoes to the support of
people who subsist on them, or would, if they were not starving for
want of them. Despatch, Home-Kulers, or else, by the time ar-
rangements for the relief of your countrymen's wants are completed,
Irish distress will be over—and much of it relievable no more.
Monday (Lords).—LOT A FORTESCUE recalled attention to a favourite
idea—not to say " fad "—of his Lordship's, which he has frequently
urged before—that of supplementing the intellectual education of
the Army by physical competition; which would be an excellent
arrangement if there existed any necessity for it whatever.
But His Royal Highness the Duke of CAMBRIDGE, General Com-
manding in Chief, who may be supposed to know, assured their
Lordships that there was none at all.
Lord SPENCER moved, and noble Lords agreed to, the Second
Reading of an Elementary Education Bill to facilitate the working
of certain educational by-laws ancillary to inculcation of the
Three R's.
(Commons.)—In answer to Mr. BAITKK, Lord HABTINGTON said
the total excess expenditure of the Afghan War was some £9,000,000,
of which £3,370,000 would have to he found in 1880-81. So much
for our Scientific Frontier.
Debate on Irish "Disturbance Bill" resumed by Lord R.
CHURCHILL, who pitched into it so severely that he straightway
brought up in its defence its author's Official Big Brother.
Mr. GLADSTONE upheld the Government Bill before the House in
the teeth of opponents who vilify and abuse it, calling it an Irish
Landlord Ruination Bill, and still harder names. He repelled the
statement of the noble Lord (R. C.) that it had been introduced for
the purpose of "oiling some part of the parliamentary machine,"
and vindicated it against "inflamed and exaggerated statements"
made by other Hon. Members. He contended, very forcibly, that, as
for confiscation, it was no worse than several previous Acts (which
he named) had been.
A very satisfactory and convincing argument, no doubt—as far as
it goes.
Mr. W. C. CARTWRIGHT opposed the Bill from the Liberal benches.
Ditto Mr. BRAND, speaking also from the Ministerial ditto.
The Marquis of HARTINGTON assured the House that nothing but
the strong conviction of those responsible for the peace of Ireland
that a measure such as the present was necessary, would induce him
to support any proposals of the kind. But it was the duty of the
Government to prevent the object of the Land Act of 1870 from
being defeated. They wished also to compel the landlord to exercise
his rights with moderation. The Executive Government in Ireland
could not carry out the law unless the Irish were convinced that it
was not only law but justice; and it was, above all, in order to
produce that conviction that the Bill was brought in.
After a fling at the Bill by Sir S. NORTHCOTE, debate wound up by
Mr. FORSTER; then division. Second Reading carried by 295 to 217,
majority 78—considerably less than the " normal" Cabinet figure.
Tuesday (Lords).—Lord WINMARLEIGH caused a parley by calling
attention to the new scheme of the Charity Commissioners for the
Grammar School of Kirkham; but it came to nothing.
Lord NORTON asked Lord SPENCER whether the Inspectors of the
Education Department had not deprecated the grants for results in
the specific subjects of the fourth schedule, and whether their depre-
catory remarks would not be laid on the table.
Lord SPENCER answered both these particular questions in the
negative, but would consider the main question to which they
related, during the recess.
Conversation, without result, ensued.
(Commons, Morning.)—Debate on Employers' Liability Bill re-
sumed by Mr. WARTON (Conservative), who urged the reference of
the Bill to a Select Committee, which Mr. K.NOWLES (Conservative)—
Mr. MACDONALD'S Motion having been withdrawn—moved that it be.
Motion opposed by Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, supported by Mr. HUSSEY
VIVIAN (Liberal), Mr. SCHB.EIBER (Conservative). Mr. WIGGIN
(Liberal), and Sir H. GIFFARD; but opposed by Mr. GLADSTONE,
and negatived by 259 to 130. Debate on going into Committee again
adjourned.
This Employers' Liability Bill proposes to make Employers very
much more liable than they seem to like. Mr. VIVIAN, on the part
of many Liberals besides himself, entreated the Government not to
force it on their staunchest supporters, and warned them that it
would be fought over clause by clause in Committee. It will not
have escaped notice that amongst the Liberals opposed to them in
voting for the Amendment, Ministers had a WIGGIN.
(Evening.)—A discussion of much interest, doubtless, to military
readers arose on a Resolution for the reduction of the active list of
Generals to an adequate and no more than adequate number, moved
by Mr. TREVELYAN. Assured by an intimation from Mr. CHILDERS
that the Government would, as soon as they had time, apply to the
Army the same system of pay and retirement that they had formerly
applied to the Navy, Mr. TREVELYAN withdrew his Motion.
Mr. RICHARD FAGET then began to expatiate on a Motion respect-
ing the maintenance of high roads; when, presto, the Honourable
House was counted out.
Wednesday (Common*).—The Irish Fishermen—as is occasionally
the case with a few others of their countrymen—require assistance.
Accordingly, Mr. E. COLLINS moved the Second Reading of the Sea-
Fisheries (Ireland) Bill, of which the objects were—firstly, to create
an unpaid Commission to manage them, and, secondly, to lend them
£30,000—he should have liked to ask for £100,000. Supported
by Colonel COLTHURST, Mr. BLAKE, Mr. PARNELL, and other Home-
Rulers, but deprecated by Mr. FORSTEH, because the Government
could not commit themselves to finding capital for the fishery busi-
ness; and of course negatived on division.
In the course of the debate, Mr. BLAKE stated that the loans made
to Irish fishermen out of the Reproductive L9an Fund had been
punctually—except in a few instances—repaid; and Mr. T. P.
O'CONNOR confirmed this remarkable statement. Money lent to Irish
fishermen has been actually—yes, and punctually—repaid. Fact.
By-and-by, perhaps, the Irish Fisheries will pay interest on loans;
a possibility to be considered by capitalists, who hitherto have mostly
regarded Irish, financially, as no better than Turks.
Another fact not generally known was mentioned by Sir A.
GORDON. Irish herrings are too oily to take the pickle, and there-

fore cannot C9mpete with Scotch salt herrings in the trade with
Germany. Irish will be Irish. Even Irish herrings superabound
with unctuous humour; your Scotch are comparatively dry.
England next came in for a little talk on the Agricultural Holdings
Act, moved by Mr. CHAPLIN; whereon debate was, in the beginning
of a speech by Mr. DUCKHAM, adjourned.
Leave having been given to Sir E. WILMOT to bring in a Bill to
incapacitate avowed Atheists from sitting in Parliament (as if total
Nonconformists could be at all more reasonably excluded than any
others), the House adjourned also.
Thursday (Lords).—Lord STHATHBDEN AND CAMPBELL, in order to
enable himself to criticise speeches delivered by Mr. GLADSTONE in
1877, moved for returns of the killed and wounded in the late war
between Russia and Turkey.
"A day too late for the fair," as in the old days, when fairs were
institutions, the saying used to be in Arcadia. So said Lord (1 luN-
VILLE (in other words), and asked how the Foreign Office could pos-
sibly give a return of killed and wounded in a campaign which this
country took no share in. How, indeed!
Lord DUNRAVEN asked, with respect to Turkey. Greece, and the
Berlin Conference, what the Government meant to do in the event of
certain contingencies which might possibly occur, and might not.
Lord GUANv i IJ.K replied that, in his 'prentice days at the Foreign
Office, his master, Lord PALMEBSTON, had taught him better than,
except now and then in a very exceptional case indeed, to answer
hypothetical questions. Hypothetical questions are questions that a
Dundreary might be expected to ask—hardly a DUNRAVEN.
(Commoni.)—The Tay Bridge Rebuilding Bill read a Second lime,
was referred to a "hybrid " or mule Committee.
At the end of a string of questions even more numerous than
usual, the House at last got upon the order for going into Committee
on the Compensation for Disturbance (Ireland) Bill. A debate on
an Amendment thereto, meant to limit its application, moved by
Mr. PELL, and negatived, was remarkable chiefly for comments on
another Amendment down on the paper, to be moved in Committee
by the Irish Attorney-General (Mr. LAW), which, Mr. PARNELL and
Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE both agree, completely alters the character of
the Bill; but this Mr. FORSTER and Mr. GLADSTONE strenuously deny.
It provides that the Landlord shall be allowed to get rid of his
liability by giving the Tenant permission to sell his holding. Cases
in which this is done will be excepted from the Bill. Is this indeed
"a change of front"? The Government says no; the Opposition
and the Home-Rulers both say yes. Politicians are violently divided
on the question.
Argue it out between you, Gentlemen. Non nostrum inter vos
tantas componere lites.
If, however, a sop to the Conservatives, the (Mr.) LAW Amend-
ment to the Ministerial measure is altogether an offence to Home-
Rulera. Mr. PARNELL said it had entirely changed Ids view of
the Bill; which, therefore, it may be presumed to have greatly
ameliorated. It looks like Law cpmbinea with Justice.
Nevertheless, there was a question to be asked, and it was put by
Lord ELCHO :—" Is it a fact that the Marquis of LANSDOWNB is no
longer a Minister?" Mr. GLADSTONE had to reply, "It is." The
Opposition hoorayed.
Motion for going into Committee carried by 255 to 199. Announce-
ment of numbers received with cheers from both sides, alike gratified
—a result also truly gratifying to the genial mind.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
At the Gaiety—Adelphi—General Notes.
BSERVE that CHAUMONT as
Lolotte it quite something to
be seen before the star dis-
appears. In this piece she
first assumes the airs of a
fine lady, and then, losing
her temper, shows us what
a Low I:>1 she really is.
Her Madame attend Mon-
sieur is only a sort of Lo-
lotte married to a gentleman
decidedly her superior, from
the little we are allowed to
see of him, whom she hopes
to surprise at supper with
his mistress. Madame is
so decidedly coarse that
nothing can excuse her ex-
cept having been Lolotte
before marriage; and the
unfortunate husband is to
be pitied.
The idea of the piece is
excellent, but it is not well
worked out, and, when the
actress only goes for a
laugh, the true spirit of
what might have been a
very charming little comedy
scene is utterly lost.
In Toto chez Tata Madame CHATJMONT cst chez elle. As to her
songs, she puts too much spice into " La premiere Feuille," making
a winter pickle of it, all its spring freshness having departed; and for
"La bonne Annee "—that is about as perfect as CELENE CHATTMONT
can make it, which is only saying, that it is about as good as it
can be.
Comparisons are odorous—and there can't be a comparison, only a
parallel, in this case—but, in a good English version of Madame
attend Monsieur, or of Lolotte, wouldn't Mrs. BANCROFT in both
or Miss NELLIE FARREN in the latter, be on two equal parallels
with the clever French actress? A copy would be impossible, and
would, of course be a dismal failure; for the two characters—
Madame and Lolotte—are distinctly and [peculiarly French; and
similar pieces, written for Mrs. BANCROFT and Miss FABREN, would
necessarily be distinctly and peculiarly English. Madame CHATTMONT
could no more play Mrs. BANCROFT'S characters in ROBERTSON'S
pieces, as the author intended them to be played,—that is. to the
satisfaction of a jury of matrons and daughters,—than could Mrs.
BANCROFT play CHATJMOHT'S Madame or Miss FARREN the French
Lolotte to the satisfaction of a Parisian audience at the Yarietes, the
Vaudeville, or the Palais Royal. The two ideas are totally apart.
Human nature is the same, but its outward expression varies as the

nationality. The French actress would ever remain the French
original of the part she had created, without detracting from the
originality of the English creation, which might be equally perfect
in its own line.
La Bonne Annee, however, is entirely Madame CHAUMONT'S pro-
perty. No one, in any language, could improve on her rendering of
this song; but any simple artless singer would please me more with
La Premiere Feuille. Ln KKIII EK is wonderful en galant homme,
taking his friend's wife—the sly dog—to a baignoire, No. 4, to see
that dreadful play, Le Roi Candaule.
DAUBRAY, arriving late at the Gaiety, has nothing to do, the
Menage Popincourt and L'Affaire de la Rue de Lourcine having
been, I am informed, "suppressed" by our Censor Morum. Rather
late in the day to wake up, after such a play as Celimare le bien
aime has been performed.
l.n Revue was a mistake in spite of Madame CHAUMONT'S five
minutes' Conference sur le Theatre, and her song of grateful apology,
which was charmingly rendered and loudly applauded; and also, in
spite of Mile. LEGAULT'S imitation of the gifted SARAH, and M. PLET'S
admirable imitation of LHERITIER.
GEOFFROY is invariably good, rarely exaggerating, but, as a rule,
playing so naturally as to invest most farcical situations with an air
of genuine probability. LHERITIER is a French BUCKSTONE, and
HYACINTHE a droll; but the public has seen them playing their own
pieces in their own house, and, though delighted to welcome them at
the Gaiety, is not very enthusiastic on the subject, specially after
the KAUAu effervescence had subsided. And then within tlie last
few years we have learnt something from our French friends, as it
appears they have something to learn from the Dutch. We are ac-
customed to first-rate ensenibks, such as are to be found at the Hay-
market and at the St. James's, while the Palais Royal and Gymnase
companies in their own special line would find themselves well
matched—and in some instances overmatched—by the capital troupe
of comedians now playing at the Criterion under the direction of
Mr. CHARLES WYNDHAM. If the prolific and somewhat reckless
French authors would associate themselves with English authors
as collaborateurs, their pieces and their pockets would gain con-
siderably; for most of their pieces, in which the point is un pen
vif, are really improved—most decidedly improved—for an English
audience's taste, by the freest adaptation possible.
Unfortunately we have recently seen, chez nous, that, as Mrs.
MALAPROP might state the proverb, "Originality breeds contempt"
—but this opens too big a subject for the present space, so, will con-
tent myself by noting the fact that Mr. DION BOUCICAULT has
achieved a success at the Adelphi, not with a thrilling drama, but
with a melange of absurdities, called Forbidden Fruit, which is to be
classed with Truth and Pink Dominoes as one of the Comedies of
Cremorne.
Diona. the ballet at the Alhambra, is not by " DION B."
Miss ELLEN TERRY is charming in lolanthe; Madame MODJESKA
and Miss GENEVIEVE WARD are shutting up; les BANCROFT depart
for their holiday at the end of July; the St. James's is over, and a
new " Hares Bill" (without the rabbits) will be brought forward late
in the autumn. Tt-lle est la vie des Theatres, and I am
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.

CHAPTER VII.
ANOTHER' HAITI DAT IN TOWN.
1S3ATISFIED with everything
and everybody, groaning in
spirit, and unsuccessful in
his interviews both with
the Archbeacon and MOB-
LEENA, poor JOHN BOUNCE
—whom in his misfortunes I
cannot help pitying, though
I honestly admit to feeling
no sympathy with his opi-
nions, or his radically
Communistic purposes —
dried his head, brushed his
hat, packed up a small bag,
and went up to London, in
order to carry out his pledge
to MOBLEENA, to blow up
Tosc TIDDLEB, and all con-
nected with the Penny
Prometheus.
After depositing his lug-
gage at his favourite hotel,
"The Voltaire's Head,1'
near the Luther Arcade,
where there was always a
philosophically Ferney -
shed Room at his disposal,
our would-be Small-Beer-
j ester Reformer proceeded
at once to the mysterious
abode of TOM TIDDLEB,
Director, Editor. Manager,
and Proprietor of the Penny
Prometheus.
TOM TIDDLEB lived as
near the sky as possible,
personifying Prometheus in
the A.ttic story. In front
of his windows, on one
side, was a magnificent weathercock, which indicated from day to day the direction in which
he could hurl his penny thunderbolts, and flash his liquopodium lightning. From this
eminence he could take the time of day from the clock of St. Stephen's, and set his own
repeater, so as to chime in with the voice of Big Ben. A barometer of Public Opinion was
suspended on the wall, faced by a Table of Tides in the Affairs of Man, which if taken at
the flood, lead on to fortune. Buckets, squibs, crackers, were packed away safely in tin
boxes, handy for immediate use; a sheet of iron hung on the wall, which, when well shaken,
sounded dreadfully like thunder; and there was proof-sheet lightning, harmless, but effective
as Japanese fireworks, and forked lightning rockets, requiring very careful handling; anti-
Roman candles, marked "with care;" flags of all colours, folded up in corners; rough
towels, for improving the circulation, and a patent blower, for sounding a mechanical Penny
Promethean trumpet, which every morning early aroused the slumbering world, and directed
the course of those millions of TOM TIDDLEB'S dependants, whom he was graciously pleased
to acknowledge as his fellow-countrymen, and fellow-citizens.
Of the hundred million thousand impressions that the Prometheus issues daily, but one
impression remains everywhere, which is, that the Penny Prometheus knows all about it,
whatever it is, and more than all about it, whatever it isn t, and that the Promethean copper
mine, in which the office is situated, has yielded the proprietor heaps of coppers, that have
been turned into gold and silver, with which TOM TIDDLEB'S ground is strewn, and which
he is engaged in picking up morning, noon, and night.
It was easy to Bee from his room, as you might from his company, after you have been
in it a few minutes, that TOM TIDDLEB was a Sybarite, though not an idle one, as the intel-
ligent reader may have already inferred, from the fittings previously described, and from
the ornaments, partly for show, mostly for use, which could at once indicate to what estate of
the realm their owner belonged.
In the centre of the room was a press; and everything around was connected with the
Press. This press was used for everything and anything. His books were in it; his table-
cloths, dinner-napkins, and all sorts of articles, and printed goods. This was his Press of

Business; and in another part was his Press
of Pleasure, in which were his white ties,
evening coats, trowsers, and so forth. The
attic-room, where JOHN BOUNCE found
himself, was of a large type, classically
supported by four editorial columns, headed
with big capitals; the window on the south
side commanded a space that was leaded
out; a statue of the Laocoon stood on an
agony column, in the corner; on the walls
were portraits of the Fathers of the Fourth
Estate, including a picture of the first Old
PABB, and sketches for several small Parrs;
while over the mantlepiece was a half-length
presentment of the celebrated JABGE
OaorsTus SALAMANDEB. the Fire King of
the Trope-picks, with the legend beneath,
"Quorum Pars Magna Fui."' On some
shelves were bottles labelled "Gigantic
Gooseberries," preserved, and three cases
of Sea-Serpents. On one wall was a picture
of the " Great Man and Dog Fight," and
below it, preserved in a sort of reliquary,
"A Hair of the Dog that bit him/' On
another wall was a sketch of The Farmer's
Friend, CHAWBACONSFIELD, and on another
an engraving of "The People's WILLIAN
of the deepest dye," in a scene from Axe
and Crown, or the Royal Prerogative;
there were, besides, some pre-Raphaelite
portraits of Latter Day Sinners; a hundred
numbers of the Prometheus, scattered
about loosely, labelled Prometheus Un-
bound, and another set, in anti-Russian
leather covers, labelled, Prometheus Vinc-
tus; the chairs were stuffed with old pad-
ding, from the back numbers; and on the
table, it being five P.M., was a capital tea,
for which TOM TIDDLEB was getting up an
appetite, in the next room, by exercising
his skill at fencing and single-stick,
attacking a column of dummy figures,
which he said improved his circulation
immensely, and quite set him on his legs
again.
"Take something," said little TOM
TIDDLEB, as he entered breathless, wrapped
in a proof-sheet.
"No, thank you!" replied JOHN BOUNCE,
abruptly. "The fact is, I've come to give
you something." And then, mindful of
his promise to MOBLEENA, he commenced
the operation of blowing up.
TOM TIDDLEB, taken by surprise at the
first explosion, stepped back in mute
astonishment at his visitor's daring bold-
ness; but, immediately recovering Tiimself
in his proof-sheet, which was a kind of shirt
of evening mail, he shouted through a
telephone. At this signal twenty oTevils
from the Printers appeared through various
panels and traps, who, seizing the luckless
Reformer, bore him off in their clutches,
and held him under a fount of type, until
he was deluged with black Printers' ink
from head to heel, when they set him free,
and let him make his way home as best he
could.
"Poor JOHN BOUNCE !" my Lady-readers
will exclaim, even though they may agree
with me that he deserved the treatment he
received. Alas! he has not come to the end
of it yet! He has offended TOM TIDDLEB,
who will go on working that fount of
Printers' ink, until no one will ever believe
that JOHN BOUNCE ever was any other
colour than jet black.
And so turned out of his hotel, pointed at
scornfully in the streets of London; he
slunk back to Small-Beerjester, where it
was a long time before he dared show even
the tip of his nose—from which the black
was just beginning to wear off—above the
window-blinds of his own house, which
very soon exhibited bills posted up, inform-
ing the inhabitants that this valuable

property was for sale, and that as there was no good-will in the
place, the fixtures would alone be parted with at a valuation.
JOHN BOUNCE had kept his word to MORLEENA; but the Penny
P.-ometheut attacked him every morning for a month with articles,
letters, and paragraphs, headed. "Mr. Bounce Again!" until
blackened as he was, bankruptcy stared him in the face, and nothing
could save him except white-washing; and how was that to be
done? Poor BOUNCE I
So far Mrs. OVEBWAYTE'S plan had prospered; BOUNCE had been
snubbed by MORLEENA; her father still retained the Mastership of
Deedler's Trust, with his other appointments; but her triumph was
not unclouded—the Archbeacon would have to pay his share of the
fees to Sir ISAAC; and if MORLEENA should change her mind, and
take pity on BOUNCE, the whole battle would have to be fought over
again, and on a field very disadvantageous to her movements.
"What is to be done, my dear?" asked the Archbeacon. as he
stood before the glass, in his Doctor's University bed-gown and hood,
twiddling the tassel of his College cap, previous to putting out
the night-light.
"Donel You Arch-Noodle?" replied his spouse, from under the
bed-clothes; "what's to be clonet Why the shoulder of mutton
and baked potatoes for to-morrow's dinner!"
"I don't quite understand, my dear," said the Archbeacon,
pausing with the extinguisher.
"But Ido, you Arch-Noddy I" returned the Lady, contemptuously.
"What's necessary must be done. Dinner's necessary; the shoulder
of mutton will be hot to-morrow: when it is cold, we can offer it to
MORLEENA, if she dares to encourage that BOUNCE!"
"I see," said the Archbeaoon, as he extinguished the light.
"As well as yon ever will in the dark," answered Ms spouse.
"MORLEENA must be married to a friend of ours, who will pay some
share of Sir ISAAC'S charges; and, above all, MORLEENA mustn't
accept anyone recommended by the Bishop, or Mrs. DOWDIE."
"Why not, my dear?" asked the Archbeacon, who was now
performing that act of cannibalism,"known as " tucking himself in,"
before dropping off to sleep. But his question met with no verbal
response, only a gentle snore, and a quiet, but vigorous kick, which
caused Dr. OVEHWAYTE to congratulate himself on the strength of
his furious tucking in.
"Recommended by the Bishop, and Mrs. DOWDIE 1" murmured
the Archbeaoon to himself; "what the deuce does she mean f"
Then, after intoning his first snore, he joined Mrs. OVERWAYTB
in her nocturne. My readers will gather from this that during
Mr. SIMM.KH'S and Mr. BOUNCE'S absence, some one had been re-
commended by Mrs. DOWDIE as a candidate for MOHLEENA'S hand.
Who was it? Fair Ladies, I will not deprive you of the pleasing
information one second lunger than I can help. Let us meet and
gossip over it in my next chapter.
RIGHT AND WRONG AT WIMBLEDON, 1880.

LIEUTENANT LAZYBOY'S RECORD. (THE WRONG WAY.)
Monday.—Lounged down in the afternoon. Found that my tent
had not been planked over. Could not stand that! Came back to
Town and dined at the Club.
Tuesday.—Having nothing better to do, thought I would look in
at Wimbledon. The carpet I had ordered for my tent not soft
enough. Utterly impossible to remain. Returned to Town, and
enjoyed a comfortable night's rest.
Wednesday.—Bothered by the BUTTERFLY girls to take them to see
the Camp. So had to do it. Horrid nuisance. Got a headache from
the firing, and in opening a gate spoiled a pair of lavender kid gloves.
Thursday.—Nice day, so thought I would go to the Camp. Had
a little dinner in my tent. Rather pleased that I was not obliged to
follow the other fellows up to Town. Slept in my tent, after throw-
ing the empty champagne bottles into the open.
Friday.—Dreadful night. All sorts of trumpet-calls. Too ill to
move. Spent the day in retirement. The salmon at yesterday's
dinner has given me an awful headache.

Monday.—Reached Wimbledon, and set to work to pitch my tent.
Great fun. Did me a world of good. Dug the ditch and spread the
waterproof sheet over the heather. Devoted the afternoon to setting-
up drill. Slept like a top.
Tuesday.—Up with the lark. Battalion drill in the morning,
shooting in the afternoon. Fresh as a rose!
Wednesday.—Saluted at daybreak. Shooting in the morning,
battalion drill in the afternoon. Lively as a cricket!
Thursday.—On duty all day. Did my proportion of sentry-go
and picket-work. No complaints. All on the alert and quite
correct. Great fun!
Friday.—Raced the sun in rising, and beat him! Attended mili-
tary lecture. Fell in for ambulance drill. Devoted the remainder
of the day to shooting. Something like a holiday!
Saturday.—Early parade. Got through three hours' steady drill
in a workmanlike manner. Inspection of Camp. Everything in
apple-pie order. Then some really good shooting. Half-holiday in
the afternoon. Racing, jumping, and other athletic sports. Never
better in my life. Shall enjoy the second week as much as the first.
Wimbledon an enormous success! Never saw such a delightful
spot! The National Rifle Association for ever!
PRE-ADAMITE PAINT.
THE question put to Mr. ADAH, the other night, as to what he
I meant to do in the shape of beautifying the interior of the home of
1 the legislature, was met by that gentleman with the usual response.
, He was not in a hurry to do anything. This answer is, of course, as
old as Mr. ADAH. Indeed older; for it has been given before his
time by several of his predecessors. However, perhaps, the present
guardian of Sir CHARLES BABBY'S masterpiece may be induced to
make some move in the matter of adornment, seeing that, as a critical
contemporary puts it, the stranger who mounts the staircase leading
to the Committee-rooms, is brought, when he surveys the frescoes.
"face to face with a ravage of thirty yeara fit to match anything"
that has befallen the work of LEONABDO perishing under the neglect of
centuries. There seems, therefore, no doubt, but that before long some
one will have to be called in. Meantime let Mr. ADAH get a pail of
water and a scrubbing-brush. If he is at a loss for a decoration for

The incontinent querist who delights to tackle
His Country's foes, from GLADSTONE to GRANT-DUFF,
With daily screeds of tkimble-ekamble stuff,
Mixed homily and catechism, fraught

TUB great difference, we take it, between the Porte
and the Bank—which includes most of the minor ones—
is that the Bank has command of money, the Porte
hasn't—"nor none is like to have." The one is a Porte
in a storm. The other is a Bank with a rest.

GIVE YOUR ORDERS!
Ma. PUNCH,
MANY persons, equally interested with myself in affairs of
pomp and ceremony, were of course highly delighted by the perusal
in the Court Circular of the announcement that—
"On the occasion of the audience granted by the QUEEN to the Ambassador
from the King of SIAM, on Friday last, His Excellency CHOW PHTA BHANU-
WONOSEMAHA KoaATiBODi TI PttHALANG having presented Her MAJESTY
with the insignia of the Order of the White Elephant of Siam, the QOEEN
was invested with the Riband, liadge, and Star, which were placed on Her
MAJESTY by Princess BEATKICB."
In the course of my favourite reading I subsequently had the
pleasure to learn from the Morning Post that—
"The QUEKN has been graciously pleased to confer on PHYA I! ATr A KOSA,
First Secretary of the Siamese Embassy, who was prevented by indisposi-
tion from being present at Windsor Castle on the 2nd inst., the Companion-
ship of the Order of St. Michael and St. George."
Surely, Sir, the Order of SS. Michael and George was a more than
ample return for the Order of the White Elephant. The insignia of
the latter symbolise a superstition; but do not those of the former
commemorate sacred personages, objects of orthodox faith? It is a
delusion to believe the bodies of white elephants to be tenanted by
transmigrated souls; whereas we know it—do we not P—to be true
that St. George slew a dragon, and that St. Michael also triumphed
over a similar antagonist, when, as represented in the stained glass
window at Melrose Abbey,
"Full in the midst his cross of red
Triumphant Michael brandished,
And trampled the Apostate's pride."
Is not the Companionship of the Order of St. Michael and St.
George the fellowship of Saints, for which PHYA RATUA KO»A may
be expected forthwith to get, if he has not already got himself duly
qualified, and when he goes back to Siam will he not very likely
convert his master the King P
Otherwise, for exchange of decorations with Sovereigns who believe
in such creatures as White Elephants, the Crown might perhaps be
advised in adaptation to their ideas, to create special Orders of
Chivalry, whereof the denomination might be derived from denizens
of the Zoological Gardens, as, for instance, the Order of the Hippo-
potamus, or the Order of the Two-Horned Rhinoceros. Therewith
a complimentary distinction received from a foreign potentate of the
Buddhist or any suchlike persuasion, might be repaid in kind, and
with such congruity and fitness of things as to make things perfectly
SQUARE.
P.S.—The United States, I think, are provided with no Order of
Chivalry whatever. Uncle SAM might be pleased to institute an
Order of the Buffalo, or of the Spread Eagle; or what would he think
of an Order of the Sea-Serpent r

C0m Cagtor.
BORN OCTOBER 18, 1817
DIED JULY 12, 188O.
FOR some little time we had been deprived of his personal presence at our council-board; yet
his letters, written with his own hand, showed no sign of failing, but, on the contrary, inspired us with
the greatest confidence in -his ultimate restoration to health. Only a few days before the end came, he
had sent suggestions for the week's Cartoon, and our latest Number contained contributions from
his pen.
That he is not still with us—that we shall not, after a while, g«eet him, as heretofore, at our
weekly gathering—is hard to imagine; but that he is gone from us for ever, that we shall never again
respond to the grasp of that good right hand, shall never more watch those keen, quirk, intelligent
eyes, nor hear his kindly voice, seems for us, so long and BO closely associated with him, impossible
to realise.
Yet, he has gone—and left us the lesson of his life.
Gifted with rare critical acumen and mental powers of no common order, his vigorous brain
directed a hand as quick and ready as his own thought.
Possessing a marvellous capacity for work, he was indefatigable in the discharge of his many
onerous duties; and so, oftentimes, doubtless, overtaxing a strong constitution, he lived and died
in harness.
He was always occupied with a variety of subjects; ever as eager to acquire, as willing to impart,
knowledge. A cultivated man of letters, an admirable scholar, he was as fie* from pedantry as he was
incapable of idleness. His relaxation was study; his mental rest, activity in some new field; wad from
his earliest schooltime to the last days of his life, his career of usefulness is an example of well-
directed energy, tenacity of application, and honest singleness of purpose. Whatever he eat himself
to do, he did thoroughly. And ifl that word may be summed up TOM TAYLOR'S character; for, from
first to last, he was, in the highest and best sense, "Thorough."
Peculiarly placed in Art and Literature, for him to make some enemies was inevitable. But, if
in error, he was readily open to conviction, and his frank and free confession of mistake was not the
least touching characteristic of his generous, manly nature.
As a Dramatist he did excellent and lasting work; but his numerous plays are so familiar to the
public as to render superfluous here anything more than a general recognition of their undoubtedly great
merits, both in construction and in terse and nervous dialogue.
It remains to speak of him, once and for all, as we of this Staff knew him. He was a warm-
heanted, genuine, upright Man. To us, his fellow-workers, he proved himself a careful, considerate,
and judicious Editor; and, in all respects, a staunch and loyal friend, whom we sincerely loved. He
had the very gentleness of a woman, and his large human sympathy could never allow him to turn
a deaf ear to any tale of distress.
Quick to detect and appreciate talent, he was ready in every way and on all occasions to hold out
a helping hand to a beginner.
Of his Home-life it does not become us here to speak—our deepest and strongest sympathies are
with the bereaved ones—but this we may say, in all humble hope, that when at last our names shall be
called, and when you who read and we who write this inadequate tribute to his worth, shall be
summoned to give an account of our stewardship, may we too, one and all of us, be able to present
the record of a life as useful, as well-spent, and as blameless as that of the dear friend whose loss
we deplore.

CHAPTER VIII.
COEAM EPISCOPO.
DB. DOWDIE, Bishop of Small-Beerjeater, was a quiet, easy-going,
silent-V9ting prelate, tenacious of such authority as he possessed,
and patiently ambitious of attaining to Archiepiscopol splendour;
tolerant of dissent, yet ever ready to Mil the fatted calf on the con-
version of a prodigal or a pretty-gal, and still more ready, whenever
the weal of the Church Established might be intrusted to his hands,
to' cut a good fat slice out of it for himself.
In person Dr. DOWDIE is a decidedly good-looking man; and
though somewhat below the middle height, he is considered as in
himself equal to an entire; episcopate of sixty-two bishops, being
exactly five feet two inches nigh, and every inch a bishop. He is
not, therefore a bishop, in partibut, .but in toto. He is somewhat
deficient in nose, as this episcopal organ is so frequently submitted
to tiie process of being snapped off, I regret to say, by his better half,
who in reality rules the roast in the Palace—Dr. DOWDIE himself
being the roast—and directs the diocese from her husband's sanctum;
while he himself, seated on his throne in Small-Beer] ester Cathedral,
has no more real power in his hands than have the recumbent stone
effigies of his predecessors on their Gothic tombs.
Dr. DOWDIE is remarkable neither for great talent nor for any
brilliant social qualities, and so his swift but steady rise in his pro-
fession, and subsequently his preferment from one See to another, in
rapidly improving succession, was an enigma to the world outside;
and he himself was as unintelligible as an inscription on a Moabite
stone, except to Mrs. DOWDIE, who had so often translated him into
various diocesan dialects, from Land's End to Northumberland,
that by the time of his latest instalment on account of his Small-
Beerjester Bishopric, he might well have been intoxicated with his
success, having been in England half-sees over within the first three
years of his Prelacy.
As the great Earl of WARWICK had earned the title of King-maker,
so Mrs. DOWDIE had thoroughly deserved the honourable sobriquet
of "Eminent Translator," which had been conferred on her by all
the ecclesiastics, their wives and families in all the dioceses. Once
having completed the rough translation, this worthy woman set her-
self to carefully adapting the bishop to the new stage where he had
to appear. The Bishop was entirely in her hands; he never moved,
proprio motu, but only when she pushed him forward; whatever
she made him take, he took, including a black draught, or white one,
if either were in the game on the board; and when not in action he
was only too glad to remain upright, and always on the square.
Yet, perhaps, he inwardly groaned under the domestic tyranny
which, to all outward appearance, he seemed to accept with philoso-
phic contentment. But tor her promptings his ambition might have
taken quite another turn, on the military parade, or in Westminster
Hall, and, indeed, he would never have accepted his first Mitre, had
not his spouse pointed out to him that he " might err if he refused.it."
Perhaps, Ladies, he was silently sighing for an opportunity to
break away from these bonds, which gave him so little interest, to

ON A BREAD-PLATTER.
"WBU,, AUSTIN, CAN YOU READ THAT?"
"No, MAMMA."
"WELL, IT is RATHBR DIFFICULT I THOSE ARK OLD ENGLISH

sert his independence, and, so to speak, to throw away the Female
ictionary to which he had owed his rapid and most successful
auslations. If he ever ventures to insinuate that heing a Bishop
i should like to have his own latch-key and go out occasionally
: himself; if he occasionally remonstrates against being compelled
clean the children's hoots and cut their hair, simply because he
ears an apron, and must put it to some economical use, Mrs.
DWDIE retorts with the question from her Episcopal Catechism,
Who made you what you are?" to which his Lordship is com-
lled to reply, " You did, my dear," and she then reminds him with
i little asperity, that when he was first made Bishop, he was only
i Eighteen-penny Ordinary, supported by the voluntary contribu-
>ns of Commercial Travellers, and now he is on the high road to
Prime-meat of all England! Was she not carving it all out for
m? Cm Bono, if not for the joint good of himself and his
raily?
The Bishop admitted it. Then why this ingratitude? she asked,
it her hear no more of it. And so his faint attempt at insubordi-
.tion came to a lame and impotent conclusion.
At length, however, the Bishop fancied he saw a ray of hope
earning in the eye of his new chaplain, the Reverend MATTHEW
.VTTIX, who had been selected out of a perfect regiment of appli-
nts by his experienced wife; for this excellent lady would nave
chosen all the clergy for the diocese had the opportunity offered, and
reduced them'all to submissive obedience to her sovereign will.
"You're quite a good Uaeen BESS." the Bishop had said to her
playfully, when he saw her a little ruffled,—which probably suggested
the resemblance, pictorially.
"I 'd be an Ecclesiastical Britannia, if I had my way," was the
worthy woman's rejoinder. "Britannia rules the waves; I rule
the See."
The Bishop hummed to himself the remainder of the tune which is
wedded to the declaration of the eternal freedom of Britons; but he
thought it the safest policy to offer no further observation.
Mr. MATTHEW MATTIX, the new Canon, Domestic Chaplain to the
Bishop, and special protege of Mrs/DowDiE, is, however, far too im-
portant a personage in this story to be dismissed with a few hard
lines in the middle of a chapter; indeed it would have been more
than the Bishop himself would have dared to do, even in the most
crowded chapter ever assembled, against the express desire of his
wife, to whose superior will and judgment, I, my dear Ladies, must
also bow, and ask your attention to the portrait which I shall now
have the pleasure to present for your inspection, though I can
scarcely describe the operation as pleasurable, since Canon MATTHEW
MATTIX is no favourite of mine, as I may warn you beforehand, with-
out prepossessing yon against him, and with every intention of
treating him as fairly as possible.
Mr. MATTHEW MATTIX was not originally a member of the Church
Establishment; but being, as his family name implies, of Angular-
Saxon Dissent, he had adhered to the Early Perpendicular Persua-
sion. However, when he was only live feet two, he entered as aa
under-sizar at St. Rhombus College, where, on his rapidly attaining
the standard of six feet, he was made a Full-Sizar, in which position
it was his duty to chop logic for the Master and Fellows, and make
the hardest props for the support of the Mathematical Tripos. In
this occnpatipn he made such progress that he was elected Gradient
of his college, an honour that was only conferred on one in six; when
in diametrical opposition to his father's wishes, he renoimced the
Perpendicular Persuasion, and through the influence of his patron,
Sir KUJIFKK HENCE, to whose family circle he had been admitted, he
was appointed to the valuable Rectangularship of ST. EUCLID'S
College, instituted for the Propagation of Parallelograms in the
Polygonian Islands. On the occasion of his preaching his own first
Parallelogrammatic Sermon; which, it must be acknowledged, he did
in excellent axiomatic English, he captivated the rich vulgar widow
of a defunct Dyer, who considered his complements as addressed to
herself.
This devoted Lady disposed of a large portion of the property
which her husband had made by dyeing, in order to purchase for
Mr. MATTIX a Living, and she was on the point of appearing in her
true colours, after throwing off the weeds, when Time's inexorable
scythe gave her her coup de grass. Her entire property went to her
relatives, except a box of her best weeds, which were left to Mr.
MATTIX, and so all his hopes in this quarter ended in smoke.
The following year he won the Rhum Boyd Scholarship, by a
learned essay on the Tripos and Onionos of the Ancient Greek Supr
perstitious Rites. This prize is in the gift of the Greengrocers'
Company, which at once elected him as their Honorary Chaplain,
when he immediately rented a commodious house charmingly situ-
ated in the most fashionable square of the Hypotheneuse, which gave
him the right to the tolls, not only from all the belles crowding to
his church, but also, by a grant of the College of St. Rhombus, from
everyone.crossing the Pont Asinorttm.
Here he made Mrs. Do WDM's acquaintance, and the intercourse
very speedily became close and confidential. From the moment he
became the Bishop's Chaplain, and Canon of Small-B«erjester, Mr.
MATTIX resolved that.'he—he, Mr. MATTIX, would in effect be Bishop
of Small-Beerjester. Mrs. DOWDIE had also chosen the same posi-
tion for herself. Mr. MATTIX flatters himself that he can out-
manosuvre the Bishop's wife, and that, if other means fail, he has a
reserve force in his hand in the shape of the Bishop himself, who,
be is confident, would gladly avail himself of any safe opportunity
of emancipating himself from the petticoat tyranny.
~Mr. MATTIX is tall of stature, but decidedly Low in his views. He
is somewhat broad-chested, but very narrow-minded. When there
are two lines for him to take, he can, according to his inclination, be
either obtuse or acute. His forehead is square, his eyes look round,
and are occasionally bisected with mathematical precision by heavy
Euo-lids. To some people the bridge of his nose is something they
cannot get over, and its classic outline bears a strong resemblance to
[he above-mentioned Pans jlmorum, which is the only Roman thing
about him; as any approach to an M. B. waistcoat, a high-cut clerical
coat, or an imitation jug am or Roman Collar is, in Canon MATTIX'S
eyes, an intolerable abomination. His hands are large, but otherwise
they are no great shakes. For myself I have always disliked his
manner ol shaking hands; his right hand is cold and fishy, and
.ts touch is flabby'; but on the other hand it must be borne in mind
ihat he is a servant of the Church Establishment, and not a pro-
fessional Shaker.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEL
Such is the clergyman whom Mrs. DOWDIE has introduced into
Small-Beer jester as her husband's Domestic Chaplain; he is neither
a Cherub, nor a Demon; for to the former a stall-seat in the Cathe-
dral would have been of no practical value; and as the latter he
would have been sadly inconvenienced to Had a suitable place for his
tail, which would have caused a considerable coil among the clergy
generally.
Mrs. DOWDIE has heard all about JOHN BOUNCE'S proceedings, one
has determined to place her favourite in Mr. SIMONY SIMPLEB'S place
whenever that Gentleman shall be forced to resign, an event which,
as we have seen, is not likely to happen quite so soon as the Bishop's
wife had expected. Mrs. DowDIE lias at present no idea that the
Reverend MATTHEW MATTIX has cast a loving eye on MOHLEENA, an<]
Mrs. OVEBWAYTE is for once wrong in her surmise that Canon MATTIX
has been recommended for the vacant place in her sister's affections
by the Bishop and Mrs. DOWDIE, whose mutual enemy the Arch-
beacon's wife is by nature and position. Each Lady wishes to gel
the whole ecclesiastical power of Small-Beerjester into her own hands,
and the Bishop and Arehbeacon are only their puppets. MM. O VK u-
WAYTE has managed to dispose of JOHN BOUNCE, and she is now
looking forward to rendering useless all Mrs. DOWDIE'S efforts at
supplanting her father on the Mastership of Deedler's Trust. More-
over she is determined to defeat whatever matrimonial designs Mr.
MATTIX may have on her sister MORLEKNA, and as he is opposed to
thelArchbeacon's interests generally, she will not rest until she hat
driven him out of the Small-Beerjester Diocese, and with him, if
possible, the entire DOWDIE party; and it is not improbable that the
excellent Lady may have ambitious dreams'of her bosom's'fLord being
seated heavily on the Episcopal throne. Be this as it may, Mrs.
OFEBWATTE contents herself at present with frustrating Canon
MATTIX'S designs on MOBLEENA, and on the Mastership of DEED-
LIB'S.
"He is a great gon, no doubt," she has said to the Archbeacon, in
one of those nocturnal episodes at the Archbeaconry, whereof we
have been so frequently the unsuspected witnesses. "He is a great
gun, no doubt; but for all that, Archbeacon, I '11 spike the Canon."
"But, my dear, the Archbeacon ventured to suggest, "suppose
MOBLEENA falls in love with him."
"Fall in fiddlesticks, you Arch-Noodle!" retorted his Lady.
"My father will resign his office of Percenter, and we must have
somebody ready in the Arohbeaconry to fill the vacancy, and to
marry MOULEENA. Then when the Canon is spiked, our candidate
can step into his shoes, and if you're only half awake ."
"I am, my dear," said the Archbeacon. taking a vigorous pull at
his night-cap that stood hot by the bedside.
"You may step into the Bishop's shoes and gaiters."
"But my itty tiddy-pop," began the Archbeacon, cajolingly,
"who is the man we're to have here ready for thePercentorship and
MOBLEENA'S hand V"
"Who!" exclaimed his spouse, giving so startling a baok-legger
as nearly sent the Archbeaoon Hying on to the floor. "Who! why
you Arch-idiot," she was never more familiar than this in addressing
her husband., "your old friend Mr. ABABLB."
"The very man!" exclaimed the Archbeacon. "I'll write to
him to-morrow. I '11 write about ."
"You'11 right-about face now," interrupted his spouse, turning
away, "and don't bother me any more."
"Song swore," murmured the Archbeacon. And then the worthy
couple gradually sank off to sleep, performing in their slumbers a
duett from Notey en Egitto, performing triumphant marches on their
two organs in anticipation of the glorious victory over the DOWDIE
party, and the ultimate spiking of the objectionable Canon.
And who is Mr. ARABLE! Ladies he is far too important a person
to be introduced at the toil of a chapter, or at the end of any chapter
of a tale.
A Double Saint's Day.

the day following, the Legitimists celebrated that of their Chief, the
Count de CHAMBOBD—the festival of his Patron Saint, the Fifteenth
of July. That, in their Calendar, is St. Henri's Day; but since
a Saint is a Saint all the world over, HENBI CINQ, as they call
him, may rejoice under the tutelage of another Saint also besides
St. Henri—the guardianship of two Patron Saints, 88. Henri and
Swithin; and in particular enjoy the advantage of invoking the
latter to send him a long reign.

A THREATENED INFLICTION.

THE statement made by Lord ES.FLKLD, in the House of Lords, as
to the course to be followed in taking the Census of 1881 has relieved
the minds of numbers of people of a great load of anxiety. Alarm-
ing rumours of the questions that would be put, and the answers
that would have to b« returned, in the Census forms, under the
heaviest penalties, were disturbing the equilibrium of everybody
everywhere. Some excited householders went so far as to say that
the Census was only meant to incense us, and to denounce it as in-
quisitorial and vexatious, an intolerable interference with the liberty
of Britons, certain to arouse angry feelings in the breasts of thou-
sands of harmless Heads of Families, and to sow discord between
Churchmen and Nonconformists, total abstainers and tipplers, allo-
paths and homoeopaths, and all the other respectable but differently
thinking sections of the community.
Happily, all these apprehensions have proved to be groundless.
\Ve know now that the Census paper of 1881 will be well nigh as
simple and harmless as that of 1871, and we can therefore review,
with a quiet mind, some of the traps and pitfalls which rumour
insisted Heads of Families would find lurking in the document to
be left with them, on a certain day next April, by the Enumerators.
The most disquieting report was that the statement of age would
have to be supported by affidavit, or, in the case of Moravians,
Quakers, and Separatists, by a statutable declaration. Cautious
ladies (likewise gentlemen) trembled to think that their hour had
come at last, and meditated emigrating, between now and April,
1881, to some happy innocent country where statistics and Censuses
ore alike unknown.
Many quiet families did not relish the idea of having to disclose
the average weekly consumption of wine, beer, and spirits on the
premises. Smokers puffed at the notion of being compelled to
render a return of their expenditure on tobacco, distinguishing
between pipes, cigars, and cigarettes.
Another threatened question was whether the family were allopath
or homoeopath, or "Peculiar People," faithless in all doctors, and
following a path of their own.
But far worse than this was a terrible whisper that all unmarried
females would be called upon to declare, without reservation, whether
their affections were engaged; and to satisfy the Enumerators that
in taking country walks with a male companion, corresponding,
exchanging presents/, &o., they were acting with full parental
consent.
Domestic animals, it was reported, were to be included in the
return. A harmless requirement, but it was foreseen that nice ques-
tions, difficult of adjustment, would arise-yfor example, whether
the Cat actually slept on the premises on the night of the enumeration.
A demand for a declaration of political opinions would, it was
contended, if persisted in, light the torch of Revolution throughout
the land.
About one hundred and fifty religious sects and parties fully
expected to be harassed with prying and trying questions.
Lastly, prostrate bewilderment waa the condition of the perplexed

PITY A POOR FO(E)STER-MOTIIER!
OH, he always were weak in the knees, I know, and a leetle bit
shaky, but still
A more innercent and well-meaning child there never could be than
my BILL!
Which his birth premature and promiscus-like were a good deal agen
him, poor pet!
But I 've missed him keerful, and I 've fed him reglor, and he it that
lovely, and yet
Them boys, them rascally rumpageous boys, they are down upon him
like bricks—
Though that ain't the word—with their stones and shied taters, not
to mention rotten eggs and thick sticks.
From the very fust they was that unjust that they wouldn't trust
him a mite,
Now, do it stand to reason as a mossel like him is likely for to kick
or to bite.
Or to ruin any think in the varsal world? See him toddling flipputty
ttopputty,
Fust one side, then t'other! It's rediklus, quite, to fancy him
pitching into " proputty."
A innercenter cherub never cut a tooth than him, my poor little
BILL,
Which them wenomous boys, drat their nasty noise I is a-doing their
best for to kill.
Though why they should chivvy him into his coffin is more than a
body can tell;
As the most aggrawacious of the 'ole lot of 'em is that Irish boy,
PABNELL,
A more cantankerous and howdacious young rebel never broke a fond
patient's heart;
Nothink never don't please him not nohow, confuge him I and cer-
t'ny I have done my part.
Sometimes I 'ardly seems to know the poor child myself, he's that
altered in face and in figger;
And for all my care and my tender cosetting he never seems to grow
any bigger.
As to better, they 'd " amend " him off the face of the earth—they 're
as woid of heart as of manners I—
And o'er his little corpus shout their "Hear, hear, hears.'" jest
like demons a howling hosanners.
I 'd like to larrup them all round, the young waggerbones; who dust
say they derserves the birch ill '<
PABNELL and BIQOAB, and the other Paddies, likeways also that
RANDOLPH CHUBCHILL,
Who's as bad as the worst, and that ojus GOBST, as I 'd string him
up in a halter,
With that sarcy GIBSON and that spiteful ELCHO, and that cold
supercilious WALTEB.
Oh mussy me! There, they 're at him agen, my poor unfortnit BILL!
With his back all askew, and his side kinked iu, and his spindle-
shanks wobbling still.
It's all pelt! pelt! pelt!—have they never felt what a Forster-
dame's feelinks must be?
Oh! there's one in his wind, and a half brick behind, and a rotten
egg squelched on his knee I
And what can / do? What a hullaballoo! He '11 get reglar riddled,
he will.
They won't let him pass!! I Oh what will become of my poor little,
dear little BILL? [Left lamenting.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

FRIDAY, Jaiy \) (Lord;,).—On liio iloti.m of Lunl SJ'K.NCKB, a
Scotch Educational Endowments Bill having been read a Second
Time, the Elementary (Three R's and Extras) Education Bill, not
specifically Scotch, was read a Third Time, and passed. So likewise
were the Union Assessment (Single Parishes) Bill, and the County
Bridges Bill; as ratepayers will probably soon discover.
(Commons, Horning.)—Mr. GLADSTONE having, to a question
touching the Cabinet's Eastern policy t courteously asked by Sir H.
D. Wour, made a civil reply, sufficient to keep, as it were, the
wolf from the door, the House plunged into Committee on the Com-
pensation for Disturbance (or C. D. Irish) Bill; and in a debate on
the question that the Preamble be Postponed, floundered about all
the sitting, so as to make no progress at all, but stick in the mud.
In the course of this controversy, Mr. GLADSTONE besought the
Committee not to persevere in obstruction, and warned them that
waste of time would not induce the Government to withdraw mea-
sures they thought necessary to be passed for their country's good.
In the course of the continued altercation which followed this
menace concerning the moors, Mr. BIGGAR—for once in the way—
happened to give the Chairman occasion to call him to order. Further
cackle was subsequently adjourned until
Evening, when a Resolution by Mr. ROUNDELL, proposing the
abolition of the remaining restrictions by which the headships and
fellowships at Oxford and Cambridge are limited to parsons, but
saving the case of the Deanery of Christchurch, was moved, and,
after a discussion at this stage of the Session of course perfectly
futile, in which, nevertheless, several honourable Members took
part, necessarily withdrawn. Then the House went to work again
in Committee on the C. D. (Ireland) BUI, contrived at last to agree
on the Motion to Postpone the Preamble, and adjourned.
Monday (Lords).—Census (England and "Wales) Bill for 1881 laid
on the table by Lord ENFIELD, and read a First Time. This Census
is not to vex or puzzle people by requiring them to return their
religious opinions.
Lord ORANMORE dilated on Hibernian Atrocities, chronically cha-
racteristic of "the first flower of the earth and first gem of the
•°a;" otherwise once poetically described as
"The land of misrule, and half-hanging, and flame."
Ne noble Lord materially contradicted Lord OBANMORE'S state-
ments; whence it would appear that Ireland only wants Home-Hide
to become quite Another Place—not the Lower House of Parliament,
but one still nether—paved, as the saw says, with good intentions.
Gas and Water Orders Confirmation Bill read a Third Time. No,
Stupid, this measure did not emanate from Convocation.
(Commons.)—After interrogations and responses, Mr. GLADSTONE
moved a Resolution providing for despatch of business during the
remainder of the Session. Hereupon business was immediately
arrested by a long wrangle, in the course of which Mr. COWEN well
but vainly observed that they had too many Members, too much
work, and too much talk.
. T°° .many cooks proverbially spoil the broth out of Parliament;
in it hinder the concoction of any broth whatever.
Mr. GLADSTONE'S Motion having been at length agreed to, he then
gave notice of an Amendment, designed, on second thoughts, to
supersede Mr. LAW'S, of the Irish C. D. Bill. Then the House went
into Committee of Supply, and, finally, further considered the
Relief of Distress (Ireland) Bill in Committee, and took such time in
so doing that they did not rise to go home till nearly a quarter to five
in the morning.
Tuesday (Lords).—The LORD CHANCELLOR presented and got read
a First Time a Lord Byron Indemnity Bill, to exempt (the contem-
porary) Lord BYRON from the consequences of having, by an over-
sight, taken his seat and voted before having sworn his oath and
subscribed the roll in this present Parliament. Further proceedings
perfunctory.
(Commons, Morning.)—Irish C. D. Bill again; Committee thereon.
In moving that the Chairman report progress, Lord It. CHTTRCHLLL
called on Government for some explanation of Mr. GLADSTONE'S
most recent Amendment, which he called a third or fourth change of
front. Answer from Mr. FORSTER in general terms. Particulars
reserved.
Controversy followed an Amendment moved by Lord G. HAMILTON,
as to whether, in practice, "ejectments" necessarily meant " evic-
tions," which, if they did, it would be sharp practice no doubt.
Fact aflirmed and denied right and left.
Mr. GIBSON moved an Amendment confining the Bill to tenants
under £15. Mr. GLADSTONE would take £30. Mr. GIBSON said that
wouldn't do; and then another change of front was charged upon
the Ministry—this time by Mr. O'CONNOR, Mr. P. MARTIN, and Mr.
PARNELL. Further consideration of Clauses adjourned till evening
sitting.
(Evening.)—Count-out; and Punch reports " Progress."
Wednesday (Common*).—Debate on Mr. FOESTER'S Irish Bill con-
tinued for nearly six hours, partly squandered upon Mr. GIBSON'S
Amendment confining the operation of the Bill to holdings under
£15, instead of £30 as proposed by its author and his Chief; partly
upon the question whether or no the Chairman had power to silence
Mr. MAC IVER (Conservative), who would persist, although thrice
called to order, in making irrelevant remarks on Emigration, a
subject said to be his "fad." Question ultimately referred to Mr.
SPEAKER, who ruled in favour of Mr. MAC IVEE and against Mr.
CHAIRMAN. Thereupon Mr. CHAIRMAN gracefully invited Mr. MAC
IVER to continue his remarks, but he forbore, and left off boring—
for a time.
Oddly enough, the Chairman, having called Mr. MAC IVER to
order for the third time, then called on Mr. PARNELL, who had risen
at the same moment with the other hon. Member, to speak. Was
not this trying to cast out Conservative Obstructive by Home-Ruler
Obstructive?
The latter, in possession of the House, forthwith moved to report
Progress, which was ironical of him; and he created laughter by
declaring that, though he thought the Bill ought not to pass, he was
not willing to take the responsibility of defeating it at the present
moment. He was good enough to signify that he would not press
tlis Motion; but discussion thereof was nevertheless continued by
Mr. BIGOAR and The O'DoNOGHUE; also by Colonel TOTTENHAM.
To enable Progress to be reported, Lord ELCHO likewise spoke, and
twitted the PREMIER with having initiated Communistic legislation.
Mr. MAC IVER then remounted his Emigration hobby, and took
another ride amid much interruption.
After an invective against Irish landlords from Mr. TIMOTHY SUL-
UVAN, the Motion to report Progress having been withdrawn, Mr.
GIBSON'S figure was negatived, and expenditure of breath on Mr.
FOBSTEE'S adjourned.
Sir BARDLET WILMOT'S Atheists Disqualification Bill broke down
on a point of formpointed out by Mr. LABOUCHERE. Here ended
the Government's Wednesday sitting.
Thursday (Lords).—The Census Bill was read a Second Time, and
the Census (Ireland) Bill, moved also by Lord ENFIELD, a First Time,
[n reply to suggestions from Lord FORTESCUE, for dispatch of com-
pilation, and for the addition of sanitary inquiries, the noble mover
said that, both for economy and expedition, the Local Government
Board thought it best to restrict the returns to the heads enumerated
in the Bill.
We occasionally hear talk of " cooking returns." There is no fear
that those of the Census will be cooked at all; but some apprehension
exists that, as before and as usual, officials will take a long time in
doing them.
(Commons.)—The Marquis of HARTINGTON informed Mr. J. K.
!ROSS that the excess of the Afghan War-costs will be so enormous
;hat the Government have concluded that a solid and substantial
aart of them ought to be borne by this country; that is to say, those
of its inhabitants who pay the taxes. But there is no occasion for
alarm or hurry; and the Government, before they propose any

definite course, will wait till they can lay all the facts hefore the
House, and will take time to consider.
On again with Committee on Mr. FOHSTEB'S little Irish Bill, or
bantling. Discussion of his £30 Amendment on Mr. GIBSON'S £15
Amendment resumed by Mr. BICGAK, who, of course, opposed all
limitations of the Bill whatever. So did Mr. DALY, Sir J. M'KENNA,
and Mr. SHAW. PABNELL recommended postponement. Mr.
FOBSTEH offered, with the consent of Mr. GLADSTONE, to give up his
Amendment of an Amendment. Mr. GIBSON taxed the Government
and the PHEMIEB, with further change of mind and front.
If Mr. GLADSTONE has changed his front, has he changed his
"dickey"? Has he ever changed his shirt-collar—except for the
wash?
Our WILLIAM deprecated the heat and extravagance with which,
he said, a second-rate matter had been treated, and asserted the
right of the Government to accommodate every section of Irish
Members.
Granted the right, query the possibility, WILLIAM.
Sir STAFFOED NOBTHCOTE having, in his turn, fallen foul of
repeated changes of the Bill in deference to Mr. PABNELL, Mr. FOB-
STEB'S Amendment was negatived, and Mr. GIBSON'S withdrawn.
Three other Amendments then also successively came to nothing,
and further "progress" was adjourned till the morrow.
Lord BYBON is all right. His Indemnity Bill passed through all
of its stages.
Friday (Lords).—In answer to Lord MIDDLETON, Lord ENFIELD
said the Local Government Board hoped to introduce a Noxioms
Vapours Prevention Bill next Session. In the meanwhile, chemical
and other works will go on emitting effluvia.
In Committee, the Preamble and Clauses of the Educational
Endowments (Scotland) Bill were agreed to with a few alterations,
and, possibly, improvements.
(Commons. Morning.)— Much time taken up with talk on the
complaint of Mr. DHLWYN that the Lord BYEON Indemnity Bill,
brought down from the Lords, had been read three times at two
o'clock before noon. Then Compensation for Disturbance (Ireland)
Bill on again in Committee. Amendment moved by Mr. GLAD-
STONE " that a landlord shall not be relieved from the payment of
compensation if he has refused a tenant's reasonable offer without
himself offering a reasonable suggestion," partly carried after pro-
tracted prattle, the remainder talked upon by Mr. BIGGAB, until
the hour came for suspending the sitting, and so talked out.
(Evening.)—Resolution moved by Mr. BBIGGS, and amended at the
suggestion of Mr. BEBESFOBD HOPE, that the erection of a statue to
the memory of the late PBINCE IIIPEEIAL in Westminster Abbey,
would be inconsistent with the national character of the edifice,
after a Division on the Motion for going into Committee of Supply,
finally carried by 171 to 116; neither the majority nor the minority
including Ministers, who, instead of going into the lobby, withdrew
from the House, amid ironical cheers and laughter. A question which
ought never to have been raised is now, perhaps, settled.
A Derby Ditty.
IN these days of characteristic ballad-writing, when every sport
and pursuit, down to deep-sea diving, has had its song, why doesn't
some one take advantage of a pending squabble and immortalise the
Turf ?" Bend O'er me Gently " would make a capital title, and, if
the Duke of WESTMINSTEE could only be persuaded to write the
words himself, somebody's fortune would be made. Messrs. BBEW_EE

of the year 1880, and the whole of the year 1881 :—
August 1st.—The Porte, before answering the Identic Note, asks
for further time. The SULTAN explains that the reforms suggested
have already secured his heartiest sympathy, and that he loves the
Allied Sovereigns infinitely better than his own brothers.
2nd.—Consultation of the Powers thereon. Much telegraphic
communication between Paris, Vienna, St. Petersburg, Berlin, Rome,

meetings of Ambassadors, assisted by " Technical Subordinates."
30th.—Scruples of the Sixth Power removed after explanation
and compensation.
September 1st.—Official consent of the Powers ready for delivery.
The SULTAN prevented from receiving the Doyen of the Ambassadors
by reason of a severe toothache.
lath.—Continuance of His Majesty's toothache. Diplomatic
pressure employed to effect a cure.
IGth.—Pressure successful. The STOTAN admits the Doyen of the
Ambassadors to an audience, and graciously accepts the further time
allowed him by the Six Powers.
October\lst.—The Doyen of the Ambassadors presses the Grand
Vizier to give an answer to the Identic Note. Satisfactory reply.
The answer ready. Fair copy only required. Slight delay, on
account of the illness of the Imperial copyist; that official suffering
from a sore finger.
November 10th.—The SULTAN explains to the Doyen of the Am-
bassadors that the Imperial Treasury cannot afford to pay for "the
writing materials" necessary for an answer to the Identic Note.
llth.—Application of the SULTAN, for a loan, to England.
12th.—Application of the SULTAN, for a loan, to France and
Germany.
13th.—Application of the SULTAN, for a loan, to Russia, Austria,
and Italy.
Uth.—Application of the SULTAN, for a loan, to Greece, Spain,
Portugal, Egypt, China, Ireland, Canada, Sweden, Australia, Zulu-
land, the POPE, the Sandwich Islands, and, later in the day (as an
after-thought), Honduras.
15th.—Universal refusal to the SULTAN'S application.
December 1st.—Vague reply to the Identic Note. Sum total—the
SULTAN will do nothing.

TURKS AND THOROUGH GENTLEMEN.
N the Morning Post the other day appeared a letter with the
ignature of "STANLEY OP ALDEBLEY," denouncing the Hares and
labbits Bill on the ground that, if enacted, it will effect the destrnc-
ion of game, and check the residence in the rural districts of the
rich and the educated, cause field-sports to disappear, and render
still fewer those of Her Majesty's subjects habituated to stand wea-
,her, and thus fit themselves to endure an autumn or winter campaign.
The bi-titular correspondent of the Post demands:—
"What, then, is the object or the motive for thia Bill? Primarily its
object was to catch rotes, and to enable the Government to figure as farmers'
ricndB. But the real motive and animus in the minds of the real pro-
moters and originators of such legislation is the same as that which has led
:he country astray from its interests and traditional foreign policy. It i» a
latred of gentlemen ; the Turks are essentially gentlemen, and must there-
ore bo got rid of. The same feeling applies to the country gentlemen."
It would be interesting to know what are those characteristics of
;he Turks generally, which constitute them essentially gentlemen.
tn the estimation of some persons claiming to be gentlemen them-
selves, one essential property of a gentleman is independent pro-
perty; the means of subsistence without labour, coupled with actual
ibstmence from any manner of work or kind of useful employment
whatever. In the disposition to live without doing anything to
deserve or gain a living, and the desire to subsist entirely on the
productive powers of others, the typical Turk, if not grossly belied,
is equal to the laziest member of the British nobility and gentry;
not certainly a type of his own order, whatever STASLEY OF
ALDEBLEY may think. For the implied comparison with Turks, as
born simply to consume the fruits of the earth, English country
gentlemen must feel flattered, rather, by STANLEY OF AXDEBLEY.
RULES FOR THE NEXT LA.WN-TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP.
1. ALL competitors to adopt a tone of modest depreciation of their
own powers, while extolling the prowess of their opponents.
2. No competitor on any account to assume a garb of an eccentric
character. Hats to be useful rather than grotesque.
3. Umpires to learn their duties thoroughly before consenting to
assume office. A novice should never be permitted to pick up a
first knowledge of the rudiments of the game in this important post
on a match-day.
4. Gate-money to be discountenanced, and grand-stands abo-
lished.
5. Press notices to be submitted for correction (when necessary) to
a competent judge before despatch to the various papers. "Reasons
why" such and such a competitor did not win, to be officially sup-
pressed.
6. Decisions of bystanders upon nice points in a game, as to
whether a ball was or was not inside the line, &c., &o., to be ignored.
Strict tennis should be as " hard and fast" as strict whist or strict
cricket.

THOUGHTS ON A BALL.
DEIR MB. PCNCH,
THERE has late-
ly been a Ball
at the hospitable
Mansion House,
given to the
Mayors of the
United Kingdom.
In an account of
this festivity 1
dad the following
remarkable statis-
tical statement: —
"Of the Mayors
nearly 150 were pre-
sent, each wearing
hie state official robi-a
and chains, and all
were accompanied
by Mayoresses."
One hundred and titty Mayors, and an equal array of Mayoresses!
Certainly our Mayors are marrving men. Not a bachelor amongst a
hundred and fifty of them! The office of Mayor is clearly not an-
tagonistic to the rite of Matrimony. The Mayoral dignity as surely
implies a Mayoress as it does a rohe and a chain. Silver cradles
are as proper to our Chief Magistrates as maces and dinners. No
single Alderman, no unwedded Councillor need aspire to the
Chair, unless he can give a solemn pledge and promise that he
will, within on« month from his election, present the borough with
a Mayoress. Whatever class of the community may look with in-
difference—nay, perhaps with aversion—on matrimony, this oharire
cannot be brought against our Mayors. They set a bright example
to those over whom they are appointed to rule, and deserve re-
election, and knighthood, and testimonials, and every other distinc-
tion and enjoyment that life can offer.
What a striking illustration, too, of the influence of woman is
herebv afforded! Can anyone suppose that all these hundred and
fifty Mayors would have come up to London in the hot weather, to
dance in their robes and chains at the Mansion House—for this night
only turned into a Mayors' Nest—unless they had been persuaded,
perhaps, ia some extreme oases, oomnelled, by their wives, their
Mayoresses? This ia a question, Mr. Punch, we must all think over
ia the holidays. TnE MAN wrrH THE ErB-GLA.w.
P.S —It has occurred to me, iti explanation of the hundred and
fifty Mayoresses, that a* all the Mayors of the United Kingdom were
not present at the Bill (those who attended it mav be distinguished
as the United Mayors of the Kingdom), the absenteas were excep-
tional bachelor*, who being ashamed to present themselves to the
LORD MATOB without a Mayoress, stayed at home.
SOMETHING LIKE A COMPANY!
Ma. PUNCH, MY VERT DEAR SIR, 24'A July, 1880.
Yor; have often claimed to ha the Philanthropist of the
civilised and uncivilised world, and your contention most j ustly has
never been denied. As a man of business, you stand preeminent as
the Financier of the Nineteenth Century—a century which has seen
the largest undertakings in the History of the Universe carried to a
successful conclusion. It is in your joint characters as a philan-
thropist and a man of business that I address yon, confident in the
knowledge that you will plaoe at my disposal a feeling heart and an
unfailing brain.
My very dear Sir, you have doubtless read the account of some
legal proceedings in connection with the Northern Counties of
England Fire Insurance Company (Limited), which were taken in
consequence of the gross mismanagement of the concern to which I
hive just alluded. My very dear Sir, the N. C. E. F. I. C. (Limited)
was aa excellent idea; and the fact that more than a couple of
thousand pounds in hard cash was subscribed by a good-tempered
Public out of a nominal capital of One Million Pounds sterling, is a
proof (if one is needed) that the English people are ever ready to
give a hearty welcome to concerns founded on a substantial commer-
cial basis. It is to be regretted, for all our sakes, that so promising
a business should have ended in what may be comparatively termed
disaster. Still, the details of the case are encouraging—mist en-
couraging. Although imprisonment with hard labour was not
included in the duties of the Manager and the Directors as set forth
in the Articles of Association, the solid fact remains that something
—and a very pleasant something—was paid in to the account of the
Association by a number of well-meaning Shareholders. This is
very comforting, and ought to be received bv every Promoter of Good
Feeling, Human Sympathy, and Public Companies of limited lia-
bility, with heartfelt Satisfaction and brain-experienced Gratitude.
This will be conceded by every Briton of average intelligence;
and, when the concession is made, the query arises, " Cannot the
experiment be repeated ''." or, to use a colloquialism of Transatlantic
origin, "Is the little game quite played out?" No!—a thousand
times no I Never shall it be said that a man bearing my name, and
with my reputation, has allowed a germ so full of promise to vanish
into a nothing airy as—in fact—the air t
So, my very dear Sir, to Business—ami Philanthropy. I have
jotted down a few ideas that only require a little thoughtful arrange-
ment to blossom into a financial scheme of colossal proportions, and
as welcome as the flowers in May. I have imagined an undertaking,
and these are my notes:—
The Title of the Company.
This of course should be of a character to encourage a cheerful
confidence in the minds of those who are invited to share their
fortunes in the common lot. Hope is one of the most blessed of
virtues, and honouraMy takes a plaoe in a list headed by Faith, and
ending in Charity! What say you to the " Bank of England Roths-
child Three Per Cents in Consols Investment Company P" It seems
to me that this title would be welcomed by thousands of country
Vicars in petty parishes, umall-annuitant-holding Spinsters, and
aged naval and military Officers on half-pay. It is to these excel-
lent persons that we must look for pecuniary support. We know
that their means are straitened-^-should we not give them the
value of our more extended experience? After dealing with us for
a time, would they not gain an accurate knowledge of the limits of
their resources?
The Aim of the Company.
_To do everything, and by "everything," of course, taking a large
view of the expression, we should mean "everybody."
There would be plenty of scope for our industry. For instance,
we might at once secure a large business in Life Insurance by insur-
ing the lives (at our own prices) of all the Residents in the principal
Cemeteries. This would be perfectly safe from a financial point of
view, as we should nuver have to pay unjess the policy-holders
appeared in person at our office to claim their money—a proceeding
which wouM most probably be of very rare occurrence. On the other
hand, the Premiums due might appear on the Profit side of our
Books as "owing." The merits of this idea include the fact that,
strange to say, this kind of insurance has nevnr been tried before,
not even by the Northern Counties of England Fire Insurance Com-
pany (Limited).
The writing of the word "Fire " reminds me that this Branch also
should give us a large portion of business. We could insure the
Palaces of the Emperor of China, and the crops, herds, farm-build-
ings, &o., &c., of the principal inhabitants of the Undiscovered
Islands, and many other persons of importance. It is an axiom that
"Silence gives consent," and, were we not forbidden by the parties
interested to carry out this proceeding, we might logically imagine
that the transactions would be agreeable to their wishes.
It is needless to point out that these two ideas alone would give us
an enormous business. I have, however, a number of other notions,
equally new and equally sound, in reserve. They might be used
a< occasion required.
The Capital of the Company.
After all the most important point. Money is as much the sinews
of Peaoe as of War. I would propose a Capital of £150,000,030,
divided into 1,000 Shares of the nominal value of £150.000 eaoh.
And herd I would adopt the plan of the Northern Counties of
England Fire Insurance Company (Limited).
The Public should pay what they pleased. The smallest contribu-
tions would be most thankfully received. Thus the millionnaire would
pay for his shares in hundreds of thousands of pounds, while the
small clerk would obtain documents of equil value for a few halt-
crowns. Every pocket would be consulted, and Cuffisus and the
pauper at his gates would have a common interest in a joint
concern!
The idea is a very solemn one, and moves me to tears!
There, my very dear Sir, you have the produce of my Brains and
Heart.
In ofraolusion I m*y siy that I shall allot to you 750 shares in tha
new Compiny, for which I shall ba glad to receive an appropriate
remittance.
As wo have not yet appointed oar Bankers, I will keep your
money—of course pro tern.
Balieva me, my very dear Sir, Yours most sincerely,
Poot-Ofir.e. Sunen D'n'.n, (Signed) jEaUMClH DlDDLER.
(To be Left until called for).
P.S.—Should you, for various reasons, feel indisposed for t'l
moment to embark in this Company, may I beg you to lend me^ui
Tuesday week, at half-past one o'clock punctually, the ridiculous
sum of one and fourpenoe halfpenny?
P.P.S. —Make the loan eighteenpence, and I will throw the
Shares in gratis.

CHAPTER IX.
THE NEW CANDIDATE.
MB. HENRY "WILLIAM ARABLE, or as he was known to his inti-
mates, 'AKRY BILL ARABLE, was a personage very much before the
world, and, therefore, considerably in advance of his time at
Oxford.
He had recently been engaged in a tremendous controversy with
Mr. MATTIX on the vexed questions of the exact position of the
vestry door in the Eastern Church; and secondly, as clergymen were
not permitted to wear their hats in church, whether a curate with a
tile off could be permitted .to officiate. These two Gentlemen had
never met one another, but war to the paper-knife had been carried
on between them in the columns of the Penny Prometheus, which,
professing impartiality, had sided with Mr. MATTIX'B view, and had
refused to insert any more letters on these subjects, except as adver-
tisements. Whereupon Mr. M ATTLI had written a tract to show that
Mr. ARABLE was no better than an idiot; and Mr. ARABLE had re-
plied with a learned pamphlet, proving that his opponent was much
worse than one. The works sold brilliantly, until public interest
began to flag, and then the combatants retired from the arena for a
few months to re-set their weapons, and to sharpen their wits.
Mr. ARABLE had distinguished himself greatly at Oxford by
passing every examination without looking at it.
"ARABLE ploughed again " had passed almost into a proverb, and
there was no distinction which he might not have attained had he
not openly declared that he preferred to stay at Oxford, and be, with-
out cultivation, a Fallow of his College. For this, however, he
would have had_ to wait some considerable time had it not been
for his suddenly indulging in serious thoughts about religion. He
bought a Missal in ten volumes for his own private reading, which
he kept in his rooms, and only spoke of it as Chambers' Missal-any;
or he would use one volume at a time as a missile for the head of any
one who ventured to dispute with him; and on Fridays he stinted
himself with short commons after, and ohaunted long Lauds: he gave
up reading the parliamentary news in the papers, he professed himself
quite satisfied with his own Lauds and Commons. His rooms in the
evening were illuminated by acolytes instead of wax-lights, and he
used to stand all day in only angular positions, like the saints in
painted windows, repeating to himself, "NonAngUsedAngeli," which
seemed to afford him considerable personal satisfaction. He shaved
his head, and took a vow never to do it again until he was able to
make a pilgrimage to Bath. Instead of a surplice in the College
Chapel, he appeared in a Roman Cotta, which so frightened the
Master and the Fellows, that ARABLE thenceforth christened it his
"Terror Cotta;" but as there was nothing in the statutes against the
use of this garment, he refused to take it off, boldly alleging that he
was not " one of the Surplice Population."
In short, Mr. ARABLE knew precisely what he was about: and
as he never contravened any of the College regulations as to walking
on the grass-plats, throwing stones at the Master's windows, putting
fireworks in the fountain, ringing the bells of the College Chapel and
then running away, or going round a corner and crying "Bobby!
Bobby I Bobby!" when he saw a Proctor, or being out after mid-
night without a special permission from the Vice-Chancellor, and as
he never " screwed up any of the officials, or got screwed himself,
the College Authorities had really no shadow of a case against him.
They could not expel a man because he chose to eat less than the

others, while he paid exactly the same. Yet it was known to every
one that Mr. ARABLE fasted, and that the consequence of this
fasting was that, losing flesh daily, he became thinner and thinner,
and it was evident to all that he was leaning towards Rome. This
leaning was specially remarkable when he came to Lent.
Such conduct as this of AHABLE'S did not suit the tradition of
Bacon College, which was established, as every one knows, after the
Reformation, in order that its Members, as a body, might be a per-
petual protest against the older College of All Souls, which, in
comparison with its new and powerful rival, soon began to fall into
disrepute as simply consisting of a "Set of No Bodies." So as Mr.
ARABLE began to develop certain new and unheard-of theories about
being "born again," the Master and Fellows of Bacon's decided
that the only thing to retain their wayward brother in the Establish-
ment would be to provide him with a snug berth.
I need hardly inform my readers, be they fair or unfair, who have
visited Oxford at Commemoration time, that Bacon College is a most
pig-turesque building, though wanting in certain pig-ouliarities,
which is accounted for by its being supposed that the architect at
the time of drawing out the plans, had a stye in his eye.
It is a small College; in fact, Bacon is considered pigmy in com-
parison with the others; but, at the game time, since its first
foundation, it has always been looked upon as the resort of Littery
men, whose reserved and studious habits well warrant the epigram-
matic motto over the front gateway, underneath the brazen SOW'B
ear, Porker Verba, which is again repeated iu Old English cha-
racters, under the figure of "Hogg, King of Basin," in the noble
sow-west window, the gift of CKAKLYN PETTITO, First Master of
Bacon, wherein the story of the above-named illustrious, and
generous Monarch is strikingly told, with all the incidents of the
Basin and The Wash, and of King Hogg plighting his Trough,
which the discovery of the original Mosaics have recently brought
to light.
"I shall be delighted to see Mr. ABABIH, Percenter in Beer-
jester," said Mr. SIMONY SIMPLER, on hearing that Mr. ARABLE had
accepted the offer, which was the very snug berth fixed on by the
College authorities; "it will relieve me of a thankless office, for the
chorister's notes are absolutely valueless; and as the surplice funds
are exhausted, the washing-bill has to be defrayed out of the
Percenter's pocket;" and poor Mr. SIMPLER played an inaudible
pecan of joy on his invisible mouth-organ.
He had never quite recovered JOHN BOUNCE'S attack, nor had he
been entirely himself since his memorable vi.-it to London. Sir
ISAAC ALLFHEEZE had not yet sent in his bill; hut Mr. SIMPLER
knew the dreaded day must arrive sooner or later; and if the Bishop
and the Arohbeacon refused to accept the responsibility which he
had incurred of presenting a testimonial to Sir ISAAC, he foresaw
nothing for it but relinquishing his office of Beadle.
"Yes," murmured the poor Master of DEEDLER'S, and a vision of
the burnished silver poker which he had so often carried in state
before the Bishop rose before him as he lifted a glass oi the Arch-
beacon's port to his lips. "Yes; here's to the silver poker! I
pledge the silver poker in a bumper!" and he drank off the wine at
a draught, as though ho saw his way out of immediate pecuniary
difficulties by pledging the silver poker.
The idea fetched mm amazingly, and if the bauble could only fetch
as much, he would fulfil his promise to Sir ISAAC, hire a tin-foiled
papier-michf property poker which would look just as good as the
original, and retain his honourable post of Beadle of Small-Beer-
jester in spite of everything and everybody.
If MOHLEENA would only play Mr. MATTBC as she had played JOHN
BOUNCE, and then marry Mr. ARABLE, Mr. SIMPLER might bide
his time patiently, and might even end his days as Bishop of Small-
Beerj ester. It will he evident from what is passing in our worthy
Beadle-Percentor's mind, that he has not been Master of Old
JEREMF DRKDLER'S Trust all these years for nothing.
So a storm was impending, of which I have already given a sure
forecast; but at present the horizon is apparently elear, the weather
is lovely, and there was scarcely a ripple on the calm surface of the
See of Small-Beerjester, when Mrs. DOWDIE determined to give a
lawn-tennis party in the Palace Gardens; on which occasion the
Bishop would appear in his own lawn-tennis sleeves, and show what
his Grace and agility could do, and Mr. MATTIX, the Domestic
Chaplain, would conduct the five o'clock tea Service by way of an
appropriate finish to a happily and_ well-spent day.
In this project she was much influenced bjr her desire of ex-
hibiting the new Chaplain to the inferior Clergy in Ms proper station
as an ecclesiastical dependant of the Bishop a household, powerless
to do anything of his own will and pleasure, but holding his appoint-
ment entirely by her favour. It occurred to her that this was an
opportunity, not on any account to be missed, of keeping the Chap-
lain in his place, and showing him that, though he was a new
Canon, yet he could not even be loaded with honours without her
permission; and, indeed, by the rules of the Palace, she heard the
Canon's report every morning at breakfast, and once again at sun-
down.

awkwardly or rant in over after over of swifr, shooters. Mr. GRACE played
thu hard bowling with perfect patience and mastery. ID about half-an-hour

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
(At Her Majesty's—for the new Opera.')
H, a Grand Opera,
Mefittofele! On
my night it com-
menced with a
prelude consisting
of a well-sus-
tained passage of
people over my
toes to the accom-
paniment of bles-
sings, not loud
but deep, of
forced smiles,
fierce looks,
grumblings, ex-
culpations, mur-
murings, explan-
ations, and, in the
orchestra, melody
of harps dis-
turbed by de-
moniac trombones.
On they came—oh, Pilot, 'twas
a crowded night! — on they
came — singing (to them -
selves)—
"Over his toe«, over his toe»,
"Pis a poor stronger whom nobody
knows."
Ah! were the Corn Laws
still in existence, wouldn't I
be a Protectionist — of my
own I At length the last
Lady in velvet—a Lady in velvet, and a lot
of it, is a difficulty in the Stalls, because her
dress clings to your knees BO affectionately-
had passed, and the Curtain drew up on the
Prologue of Mefistofele. Perhaps all this toe-
prelude was to remind me that the Opera was
by Bo-i-ro; and mine would be anything but
a beau-y toe after all this crunching.
What on earth did that Scene represent?
Nothing "on earth," or, at all events, not
exactly on earth. |OnY(the stage left was a bank of clouds—very unsafe place to deposit
money—while, high up, was what closely—or, if not closely, at all events ,at a distance-
resembled a pantomimic Smashed Tomato illuminated. On the right, in the distance, was
a view, apparently, of some portion of the Downs at Brighton. Sky above, and lots of
Operatic stars.
The Prologue, illustrating an evening call paid by Mefistofele to the Upper House—
Meflsto, by the way, would have been admitted into the Commons without any difficulty as
to affirmations—consists of diabolic solos and angelic choruses. Mefiito offers to wager that
he will seduce Faust (who appears to be a sort of test case) from the right road. The
angels—evidently very sporting characters belonging to "another and a butting world "—
accept the challenge, and lay evens.
The whole proceeding is of doubtful morality, and would not be sanctioned by the Turf
Club, as Faust s soul clearly belongs to himself, and he is just the one person not consulted in
the matter.
The music of the Prologue is something to be heard over and over again with inoreasingpleasure.
ACT I.—Frankfort-on-the-Maine. View of the flowing Maine, where the tale commences.
Easter Sunday holiday-makers. The Elector, at the head of a cavalcade, passes across.
Great excitement of the crowd to see him, as naturally there would be in a city where there
is only one Elector. What a big vote he would have! A Caucus in himself! Well, on
comes the Elector, and then comes the ballot—no, I mean the ballet, who, in the presence of
Faust and Wagner—very generous this of Borro to introduce another composer, WAONEH—
dance a sparkling " Obertas." I take it for granted that what they dance is an " Obertas"
—as named in the libretto. It is a jovial, sparkling sort of dance—the kind of thing which
it is usual to "turn on at the Maine; " and the name, being Franco-Germanically translated,
means, of course, the " Obertasse," or the "Cup-too-much dance." Mefisto, as a friar of
orders grey, startles Faust and Wagner, and then evening sets in, the mist rises—that is, the
gauze descends—and we have before us gauze and effect.
Next Scene, same Act; very quick change, reflecting great credit on the Stage Manager
Mr. HABBIS (who, like Mrs. Harris, is invisible), and talented assistants.
"That," said Mrs. MALAPBOP Junior, who sat next me and would keep the book, "that is
Fauffs Lavatory."
Into the alcove on the left came another cove, Meflsto, A fine scene, musically and
dramatically; a marvellous song for Meflsto, who finishes it by putting his fingers in his
mouth—of course he said in Italian, "I put me-fist-oh to my lips"-^in order to produce a
shrill whistle, which a waterman at a cabstand or a street-boy would have envied. Its effect,
as grotesque as anything that ever came from the hand of the Great Whistler—Whistler
Jemmy—himself. Duett for Faust and Mefisto, " Whistle and I'll go with you, my lad.'"
and—off they go I

I have undertaken a herculean task—to
tell this Opera. Having finished one head,
up crops another. No; it must be con-
tinued in our next—whenever that may be.
The story of Marguerite is partially, and
impartially, told. Siebel is not there, nor
does J/flrpuerite-NlLLSON get her Valentine.
If you can forget GOUNOD'S Faust you can
more thoroughly enjoy Meflstofele. If you
can't, you will be perplexed and vexed.
Faust has a hard time of it. He is taken
by Mefisto to witness the open air rehearsal
of a Christmas Pantomime on a Sabhath
night. Heavens! what will Exeter Hall
say? Then he is taken to a "Classical
Night" at the Ancient Concerts or the
Philharmonic. Here he meets Helen of
Troy; but Mefisto, a deceiver ever, ought
to have taken him on to Paris, and given
him a night there.
Then, in the Last Aot, Faust appears got
up like Old Father Christmas on a sugar-
topped cake, and decides for himself that,
all things considered, he is tired of Mefisto's
company, that his room below must be
worse than his company on earth, and that,
on the whole, he prefers genteel society and
a quiet life for the future, to a hot atmo-
sphere and overcrowded space, and so dies
on a bed of roses; while Mefisto, who has
wasted his time and lost his bet, gets on to
a trap and goes down to H-arrogate, where
the sulphur waters are.

(How to Manage it.)
MB. GLADSTONE'S threatened determination to see certain measures carried through Parlia-
ment in the present Session, even at the loss of a considerable portion of his holiday, coupled
with Mr. ABTBUB ARNOLD'S still more ominous avowal of his indifference to any holiday at
all, has led to the following arrangements:—
On and offer the Firtt of September next—
Partridge-shooting will commence on Wimbledon Common. The game, which will be on
the ground from noon to 4 P.M. daily, under the direction of an experienced Bond Street
talesman, will be accessible to all Members of Parliament who, after establishing their identity
end producing a written licence from the SPEAKER, can manage to hit it.
Bathing-machines will be placed on the northern shore of the Serpentine, where, by an
arrangement with recognised purveyors of eea-talt, and possibly, if necessary, with the
assistance of the Great Eastern Railway Company, it is contemplated that a very fair sea-
bath, enjoyed under nearly all ite normal
conditions, will be at the command of such
Members as are still confined to Town.
Tickets for twelve baths will be pro-
curable from the Sergeant-at-Anns. A
band of itinerant Christy's Minstrels, a
photographic apparatus, and the Humane
Society's drags will be in attendance every
morning from 10 to 1 P.M.
Primrose Hill will be broken up with
shrubs, dykes, trenches, and masses of brick-
work. It will then in its upper portion be
whitewashed, and a small hotel built on
the summit, while experienced guides will
wait at the bottom, at the Regent's Park
entrance, for the assistance of those who
are desirous of making the ascent and
seeing the sun rise. Those Members who
are also members of the Alpine Club, and
may be in search of harder climbing, will
have the privilege of ascending St. Paul's,
from which, by the kind permission of the
Dean and Chapter, all the staircases and
ladders will have been removed, both in-
side and out, and of carving their names
on the ball at the top. Alpenstocks and
hatchets will be purchasable from the
Verger on duty.
The garden of Kensington House will be,
for the time being, devoted to the wilder
sports, and, by arrangement with the Zoo-
logical Society, the whole of the tigers now
in their possession will be let loose in the
ornamental grounds at the rear. Such
Members as contemplated taking their holi-
day in Africa, will be provided with a
single ticket to the High Street Station.
Admission to the grounds will be by
voucher, after dusk.
Lastly, several yachts will be placed upon
the Round Pond, and a few experienced
salmon, and a ladder for their use, intro-
duced into the ornamental water in St.
James's Park, while " walking gentlemen,"
from minor theatres, will be hired to give
life to Rotten Row; and people who are
about to migrate to their back rooms, and
close the shutters of their front, will be
requested to delay this fashionable move-
ment as long as possible.
The hope that the above programme, or,
at least, a portion of it, will be carried out,
may rob the necessary menace of the PRE-
MIER of half its terrors.
VOLUNTEER UNDRESS.
IN a Torquay newspaper, amongst certain
orders for the 4th Battery 1st Devonshire
Artillery Volunteers, that gallant Force it
instructed that—
"3.—The Battery will assemble at Gun Bat-
tery, Walls Hill, at »U P.M., on Saturday next,
for shot and shell practice; the men will wear
forage caps and waist-belts only."
In very hot weather at Oxford, in other
days, when trousers used to be fastened
under the soles of men's boots, an Under-
graduate reported to his friends that the
summer costume at the University con-
sisted of "surplice and straps." The uni-
form assigned for shot and shell practice to
the corps above named seems even yet more
simple, and very much less additional to a
state of nature. There is a certain distin-
guished Regiment commonly called "The
Baffa." It was always regarded as an un-
paralleled body of soldiers; but,_from the
above direction, the 1st Devonshire Artil-
lery Volunteers appear to have approached
it very nearly in point of name, if not of
fame.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THETM.P.'S MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM.
HOT, hot, EO hot I My brain's on fire,
and still they go a-maundering
On and on, unweariedly, with well-
worn washy platitude,
In muddy sloughs of tangled words
for ever blindly wandering.
Who choked these bores for once
and all would earn my deepest
gratitude 1
Choke-bore! Ah me, those pleasant
words bring savours fresh and
heathery!
And in this poisoned, murky air,
that's very nearly killin' us,
I dream awhile of scented ling and
see the bracken feathery,
To wake, alas! to dreary talk and
odours vile and villanous.
No hope, no ray of light can pierce
our darkness intellectual;
For even of these wretched bores if
- happily once quit you went,
Such sweet relief from endless talk would yet be ineffectual,
For still behind there lurks the scorn of the outraged Constituent!
No mercy feels his heart of stone, e'en if asphyxiation
Should threaten with a sudden doom his chosen Representative.
I fear, indeed, his bosom glows with a certain proud elation
To see his Member crushed beneath his labours argumentative.
For this, with desperate nerve we faced the rack inquisitorial.
And bore the "heckler's" galling grin that scarcely veiled the marl he meant;
For this we came from North and South and regions hyperboreal,
To hear thsse windbags blow and buzz as Members of High Parliament 1
Parliament! We 're like the crows caw-cawing in their oroaking-room 1
In vain I've tried to comprehend, though my attention best I lent,
The feeble twaddle that I hear in House or Tea- or Smoking-room.
The arguments are always stale—the air is always pestilent.

But one consoling thought relieves our wearisome
inanity—
At least we 're free to change our place: the Speaker 'g
always resident 1
Oar lot's 11 cruel one, but, though it seems like inhu-
manity,
It comforts me to think that worse befalls our august
President!
August! that hopeful word again brings tortures as of
Tantalus,
And visions of the blessed Twelfth in my dazed brain
will flicker up—
A vision aa of breezy moors, with cooling mists to mantle
us.
The thought is maddening—"Sir,I move this House
do forthwith liquor up!"
Vivisection for the Table.
A CONTEMPOBABY states that, at a recent meeting of the
Anti-Vivisection Society :—
"Frequent reference was made to »n important article in this
month's Scritntr'i Magazine, entitled 'Does Vivisection Pay?'
which die writer answers in the negative."
Vivisection does pay, in one sense, when a physiologist
is fined for practising it otherwise than according to law.
In another sense it pays when a fishmonger who charges
so much for unscotched or unvivisected salmon asks more
for "crimped" salmon. The question, therefore, whether
Vivisection pays or not, may be answered in the affirma-
tive. Vivisection, at any rate, pays the fishmonger; a
privileged person whom the Anti-vivi sec tionists of course
duly distinguish from the physiologist.
AFTBK THE AMNESTY 8 OVEE.
FHOII the violence of the seditious language used at
the Working Men's Congress now assembled in Paris, it
is clearly proved that the Enemies of the Republic are
not all on the Right." No, nor all in the right, either.
NATURAL INHUMANITY.
ACCORDING to evidence given at an inquest held by Dr. HAHD-
WICKE at Camden Town, JOSEPH ESSEX, a child of nine-was acci-
dentally drowned the other day in the Regent'* Canal. Whilst the
first of the witnesses below-named was vainly endeavouring to rescue
him, two barges came along, "but the men in charge would not
stop, although called on by the police, and the persons looking on,
to do so." Whereas—
"It was stated by SADDER that, had the fir«t barge stopped, he would hive
been able to save the deceased. Mr. HUNT, who arrived on the spot whiie
the two last barges were passing, stated that the reason why the bargemen
would not stop their barge* or assist in saving life wat that they received
nothing f>r their trouble; whereas if they recovered a di'ad body they received
five shillings from the County."
The virtue of taking trouble, incurring loss, or running risk to
save life, is, as far as the County is concerned, its own reward.
"The Coroner, in answer to a juryman, said that there was no fund by
which he could reward the young man SADDER for his praiseworthy efforts
to save the life of the little boy. It was a great pity that nothing could be
done to the bargemen for their most disgraceful conduct."
It will rather be a pity if nothing can be done to the County that
will induce it to afford such encouragement as that which was
wanting ia the above case to stimulate the humanity of bargees.
Knowledge of the need of that provision may perhaps suffice.
Now the County authorities possess that knowledge. Let them also
know that—
"The jury returned a verdict of 'Accidental Death,' adding that the con-
duct of the bargemen was highly discreditable. They made a collection,
and gave it to SABDBK for his praiseworthy efforts."
The County will now then perhaps make that allowance for saving
hves as well as for recovering dead bodies, which, had it been ex-
pected by those bargemen, would probably have prevented any
occasion whatever for the generosity of a Coroner's Jury.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
printing certain correspondence relative to the alleged
murder of a Mr. PETER MESHULLAM. at Jerusalem,
twenty years ago. Mr. MESHULLAM had not been assas-
sinated, although, at the late Vice Consul's instigation,
it was said, somebody had been hanged.
Lord GRANVILLE explained that the correspondence
had been published onlv on account of a claim made
against the Foreign Office, and merely in justice to
private persons.
Their Lordships got on with some unopposed Bills, and
away in time to come in for a cup of five o'clock tea.
(Commons.)— From a little past four till a quarter to
six, Ministers under tire of interrogation; in the course
of which Mr. GLADSTONE, answering Mr. SCHKEIBER,
said the Government hoped to proceed on Wednesday
with the Employers' Liability Bill, notwithstanding the
absence of Mr. DODSON—who had it in charge.
Pity poor Mr. DODSON, late Member for Chester,
unseated for bribery committed in his name without his
knowledge, and against his will, by some fool, if not
hypocrite or knave. What is to prevent a political
rogue from committing bribery in the disguise of a
partisan of the opposite party, to the end of com-
promising that party's candidate? Britons, beware the
Caucus!
The PREMIER also pointed out to Mr. H. VIVIAN that
it would be absurd to waste a day in futile discussion
of the Welsh Sunday Closing Bill.
Mr. BIDDELL then gave notice of his intention to ask
the PRIME MINISTER a really sensible Question:—" Will
he favourably consider a proposal to limit all speeches
to seven minutes, with an exception in favour of
Members of the Government?"
Say, rather, perhaps, an occasional exception in favour
of some of the Ministers.
Then, once for all, into Committee on the Irish Tenants'
Grip on the Land (C.D.) Bill, and, after amendments
right and left, right on behalf of the Landlord, left in
the Grip on the Land Interest, all negatived, the Little
Bill finally struggled through Committee.
Tuesday (Lords).— Lord ENFIELD moved the Second
Reading of the Census (Ireland) Bill, and the Earl of
FIFE the ditto of the Census (Scotland) Bill. The former
Bill, like its predecessor, contains a religious schedule,
which the Irish do not object to; and it can be ac-
curately compiled. The latter, following the English
Census BUI, contains no catechism.
Clearly, the Saxon, and the Cymry moreover, look
you, like keeping their religious opinions to themselves.
Can it be that Irishmen delight to flourish their con-
flicting faiths in one another's faces?
Both Census Bills were read a Second Time, as also
was the County Courts Jurisdiction in (Ireland) Lunacy
Bill, designed to give the County Courts of Ireland
jurisdiction in oases of craziness combining unsound
intellect and limited means.
Other Bills were advanced, including several Orders
Confirmation Bills, of no particular interest to the Clergy,
if of any to the Laity.
(Commons, Morning.)— Mr. BIDDBLL asked his limita-
tion of loquacity question, to which Mr. GLADSTONE
answered No; but he saw the drift of it, and obstruction
to business might require serious attention.
On going into Committee on the Customs and Inland
Revenue Bill, Mr. HUBBARD moved, as an Amendment, a
Resolution for amending, by correction, the iniquities of
the Income-tax. Hereupon followed a debate on quite
another matter—the penny additional to that tax to be
imposed by the Budget, and the question whether or no
it would be just to repeal the Malt-tax by means of that
imposition.
At last, however, Mr. GLADSTONE got up, and replied
to Mr. HUBBARD as well as could be expected, and in
the usual way. The inequalities of the Income-tax were
undeniable, but the idea of redressing them was Utopian.
In 1874 he saw his way to repealing the tax altogether;
but we had travelled a long way from where we were
then, and he had no proposal to make now.
No, of course not. He would take nothing by it—except
the gratitude of a comparatively few. The parties
aggrieved and fleeced by the Income-tax are a weak
and defenceless minority. The majority of those who
vote the taxes and also the national expenditure, pay
no Income-tax whatever; thanks to a Conservative
Democratic Reform Bill.

"Do YOU MEAN YODR MEBRSCBAUX, DARLINO? H«RB IT H, INSIDE THE
FKNDBR, Ir SMBLT so OF THAT HORRID TOBACCO, THAT I WASHED IT FOR YOU I"
From his apology for the Income-tax the PREMIER proceeded to defend its
aggravation by a penny in the pound; and, after some words, Mr. HUBBARD'S
Motion was negatived by a majority of 217 Representatives of the multitude
to 28 Members for; the few. Then the House went into Committee, but progress
was reported immediately.
(Evening.)—Committee on the Budget Bill continued, with discussion of
details: for example, the specific gravity at which the beer duty is to be
charged. A specifically grave debate of which the gravity was a little lightened
by Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE, who with reference to the gratification of the
Farmers' desires by the repeal of the Malt-tax, said that to a sceptical mind it
might suggest a quotation from a classical author.
"Evertere domos tolas optantibus ipsis
iJlfaciles"
—which he omitted to translate for the benefit of agricultural—and commercial
—gentlemen. Nor did he quote JOHNSON, singing after JUVENAL,—
"How nations sink by darling schemes opprest,
When vengcance.listena to the fool's request."
Or else he might have insinuated that the repeal of the Malt-tax was a
darling scheme of which the concession might possibly disappoint the British
Farmer.
Relief of Distress (Ireland) Bill re-committed pending the distress; and the
House adjourned a little before sunrise.
Wednesday (Commons).—At work on the clauses of the Budget in further
detail, discussing questions chiefly of ciphering; how much sugar shall be deemed
equivalent to a bushel of malt from 27 Ib. to 28 lb., at what figure to fix the
specific gravity of worts (encore) and so on. Mr. WATNEY, Mr. M. A. BASS, and
Mr. WHITBHEAD, on the part of the brewers, haggling with Mr. GLADSTONE, who,
amendments being withdrawn or negatived without a division, carried all his
points; but he promised the men 01 beer to re-open the questions between

him and them should experience prove his calculations wrong—instead of
confirming the conclusions of his consummate " chalk-head."
Mr. SULLIVAN moved an Amendment providing that the valuation of public-
houses in Ireland shall be GRrmins's valuation, but withdrew it on Mr.
GLADSTONE'S undertaking to provide that the valuation shall not exceed 20 per
cent, valuation. Who's GRIFFITHS? As an actuary and accountant, evidently
in Irish estimation at least, a safe man.
Adjournment of sitting, formal business despatched, and House adjourned.
Thursday (Lords}.—In Committee on the Census Bill, an Amendment, pro-
posed by Lord FORTESCUE, to provide for the local collection of sanitary infor-
mation was rejected without a division, but another Amendment, moved by
the same Peer, appointing that an abstract of the Census shall be published
within three months instead of twelve, passed without opposition; and thus im-
proved, the Census Bill went through Committee.

Government, the first on the list (of four) being Lord BALFOUR of BURLEIQH—a
romantic if not historical name.
The Irish Census Bill, and some smaller Bills, having passed through Com-
mittee, noble Lords knocked off.
(Commons.)—Government having, by the mouths of the ATTORNEY-GENERAL,
Sir C. DILKE, and Mr. GLADSTONE, given nearly sixty querists indefinite answer?,
the House set to on the Report of Amendments on Mr. FOHSTER'S little (Irish)
Bill. Two new Amendments proposed by Mr. GIBSON to temper the Bill for the
unhappy Landlords, were accepted by the Ministry; a third, moved on the same
behalf by Mr. CHAPLIN, got negatived. Then, on the Motion of Mr. FOKSTER,
the House disposed of the question of limitation, carried over from the Com-
mittee, by deciding on a limit of £30 valuation; and, having settled that point,
ordered the Bill to be read a Third Time on Monday.
Mr. FAWCETT next moved the Second Reading of the Post-Office Money Orders
Bill, to cheapen and facilitate the transmission of small sums. It proposes to let
you send one shilling; for a halfpennv, sums up to ten shillings for one penny,
and up to one pound for twopence. Here is a lovely little Bill for you, a truly
Liberal Bill, although, as Mr. FAWCETT candidly said, it was practically the Bill
of the late Government, and it had the warm support of his predecessor.
After some precautionary criticism from Sir J. Lro-
BOCK, who wanted the Bill overhauled by a Select Com-
mittee, it was read a Third Time, and the House, having
at last done one bit of good work, adjourned.
Friday (Lord*).—Inquiry as to the progress of the new
Ordnance Survey, from Lord BRAYB, answered by Lord
SCDELET, and from the Duke of SOMERSET about the
Geological Survey, replied to by Earl SPJSSCKB, in a brief
and instructive lecture on geology.
On the Report of the Census Bill, Lord ENFIELD
opposed an Amendment moved by Lord LIMERICK to
provide a special Census for the City of London, but said
there was nothing to prevent the Civic Monarch and his
Aldermen and Council from doing a Census of their own.
A considerable batch of Bills were forwarded, and
then their Lordships adjourned.
(Commons, Morning.)—The Marquis of HARTINGTON,
in answer to Mr. ARNOLD, announced that he had re-
ceived a telegram from the Viceroy of INDIA, saying that
at a Durbar on Thursday at Cabul, ABDUB RAHMAN had
been proclaimed Ameer of AFGHANISTAN by somebody
or other, whom the telegram did not name.
As ABDTTR RAHMAN is supposed to have European
ideas, in due time we shall perhaps have a photograph
of him as Ameer, smoking a meerschaum.
(Evening.)—Moving for papers, Mr. BRYCE expatiated
on the frightful state of things existing through Turkish
misgovernment in Armenia and Asia Minor; and a con-
versation ensued, graver than the debate of the other
evening about specific gravity.
Sir C. DILKE said the Government was doing all it
could with the Porte in concert with the other Powers.
The pressure of six Powers was being brought to bear on
the Porte with a view to enforce reform.
European six-Power pressure is pretty strong, but
will any pressure milder than hydraulic pressure bring
the Porte to reason?
Mr. GLADSTONE, after Mr. ONSLOW, Sir W. LAWSON,
and Mr. LABOUCHEKE had said their says, defended the
Government's line against Mr. ARHMKAD - BARTLETT.
They were working with caution, and within the limits of
their duty; but were not prepared to act save in concert
with the other Powers.
Success to the Powers, exerting six-Power pressure in
concert on the Porte; and may they keep it up at con-
cert-pitch to the desired end.
After a few Turcophil observations from Mr. BOURSE,
the House agreed to Mr. BJJYCE'S motion for papers, and
adjourned itself.
A PHENOMENON OUT OF PLACE.
THE subjoined advertisement, extracted from the
Liverpool Daily Mercury, appears to attest the existence
of a very extraordinary creature, of a description gene-
rally considered by Physiologists as fabulous :—
WANTED bya Mother and Son, a Situation as KITCHEN
GARDENER or COWMAN. No objection to horee.
Good references. Address, &c.
A "Mother and Son," really both, would surely do
better to get shown as a lusus natura than to work as
a Kitchen Gardener or Cowman.
For a long time we have ceased to hear anything
about Hippophagy; but the statement foregoing, that
the advertiser "has no objection to horse," appears to
indicate that a prejudice against a particular form of
animal food is decreasing amongst the laborious classes.
CYNICISM CORRECTED.
IT is not true, says SMELFUNGUS, that there is always
something not altogether disagreeable to us in the mis-
fortunes of even our very best friends. When any of our
friends whosoever get into difficulties, and apply to us
for assistance, which we cannot well afford to render
them, but shall be considered mean if we don't, their
misfortunes then give us unmitigated pain.

SPORTING INTELLIGENCE."

MB. PUNCH, MT GOOD YOUNQ FRIEND,
I GIVE you your second title because I would have yon
know, Sir, that I was wearing my Sovereign's uniform and fighting
battles under the shadow of the British Flag long before you were
born. Sir! Zounds, Sir! you were a baby in your cradle when I led
the forlorn hope at — But there, I won't tell you where. A warrior
never boasts of his own feats of arms. I am generous to a fault,
and never misrepresented a fact in my whole life! A true old
English gentleman, Sir, from my white locks to my patent leather
boots.
Attention! You want me to give you a few hints on Sporting.
Well, Sir, you could not have come to a better quarter for informa-
tion. I may say, Sir, that I have been born on the turf (the dear
old Irish turf it was, bedad, Sir!), and have lived on it in various
quarters of the world all my life long—as a boy, as a man, as a
veteran. Like every commander, I have seen my ups and downs.
I have made pots of money, and have lived, Sir, in the most elegant
affluence. I have had a Town house in Piccadilly, a couple of stalls
at the Operas, a shooting-box in the Highlands, a villa in the Isle of
Wight, with a yacht moored off the dining-room window, a pied d
terre at Paris, and a settled-from-the-Conquest family seat (with a
few thousand acres, half a dozen lawn-tennis grounds, an orchid-
house, and a first-class Tudor midnight ghost, all complete) in the
best hunting county in the shires! Yes, Sir, I have known what
our " lively neighbours" call the " High Life." On the other hand,
I own (without shame) that I have sometimes been "in retreat."
Before now I have lost everything, yes, Sir, everything—but my
honour!
"Was I at Goodwood? "Why, Sir, you might as well ask me if I
had ever captured a battery of the enemy single-handed! Of course
I was at Goodwood! And a very pleasant party we were, Sir. The
usual four—my Right Hon. Friend (who had actually put off a
Cabinet Council), the Archbishop, the Millionnaire, and myself. My
ecclesiastical colleague (if I may be permitted the expression) was in
his very best form. His story about the SULTAN, the Margate
Bathing-Machine Horse, and Her Majesty's Consul at (you know
where), was absolutely tcreaming! The practical joke, they tell me,
was contrived by BISMABCK—the dog I Ha! ha! I will repeat it.
"Well, you must know that when Lord SALISBURY was but of
course yon have heard it before, Sir! If you haven't, Sir, more
shame to you, Sir, for neglecting the duties of your position! My
Right Hon. Friend was depressed, and was scarcely equal to dis-
cussing finance (his strong point, you know, Sir), with the Mil-
lionnaire. My prottge, the Millionnaire I How much does he not
owe to me! And, if it comes to that, how much do I not owe to
him! But, with the delicacy of true friendship, Sir, an account has
been kept by neither of us. At least I can answer for myself, Sir.
And now to the racing. Right shoulders forward—quick march!
Well, there was nothing in it I Hollow as a drum. Sir. The Good-
wood Cup was a match, Sir! Think of that, Sir—a match, Sir!
Will yon believe it, Sir—a field of two! Scarcely enough to afford
a cry of "A thousand to one—bar one," Sir! The prize, according
to the Times, was a "Roman Crater," Sir! Although I am an
Englishman in the very best sense of the word, I still have a few
drops of Irish blood in me, and I was disgusted to find " the crater"
so insulted, Sir! It was an outrage. Sir—an agrarian outrage, Sir!
Bat to continue. The favourite was nowhere, and (as the Archbishop
observed) Dresden China was not broken. Good, eh? A quaint
conceit, Sir 1 None of your nonsense, Sir! I am a simple, guileless
old soldier, Sir, and I tell you it amused me! Law! how heartily I
laughed as the old ecclesiastic paid me over my little earnings! To
humour him, I had taken him several times over, Sir, about Chip-
pendale at 10,000 to 30! I made the odds for him myself!
But I was so thoroughly disgusted, Sir, with the whole affair that
I gave up Goodwood on Friday in favour of the City. It always
does my heart good, Sir, to see our grand old Metropolis in all the
glory of its Business Pride! The Home of Enterprise, Sir, the very
Centre of Commerce! Ah, Sir, a noble thought, a very noble thought
indeed! And, truth to say, Sir, I had a small commission on hand.
Sir. I am good-natured to a fault, Sir, and can say "No," Sir, to
nobody. So you shall hear, Sir!
The aged widow of my deceased uncle had entrusted me with what
she accurately termed her "little all" for investment. A few
hundreds, don't you know, Sir, just enough to keep the wolf from
the door down at Brixton. Of course, as an officer, a gentleman,
and a relative, my services were given to her gratuitously. I
insisted that she should have every penny—every penny, Sir—of the
interest accruing from the Bonds. She was to lose nothing —
absolutely nothing, Sir, unless the Stock (on realisation) happened
to go down. I, on the other hand (as she had a poor head for busi-
ness, and I didn't want to bother her with details), agreed only to
take something when—mark the when, Sir—the Stocks went tip /
Then—but not until then—was I to take the difference. I selected, a
good substantial healthy-looking Stock of unquestionable respect-
ability, and—well, as I write, the blessings of my venerable and
venerated connection are ringing in my ears! Zounds, Sir, I am
affected almost to tears! The rest is silence!
Yours to command,
THE COLONEL.
P.S.—By the way, should—I repeat should—you and your friends
(I like to be genial, Sir, and I say the more the merrier, Sir,—the
more the merrier!) want something really safe, why follow me. I
have invested the fortune of my aged Aunt (dear old lady!) in
Turkish Fives!
ART POUR ART.
(From a Parisian point of view.)
THE Englishman's Art! Ah! ma foi, 'tis ridiculous,
Some, Boeotian, maudlin, meticulous.
Ban pere defamille and thrall to the dutiful,
He 's quite devoid of true sensg of the Beautiful.
Is he not steeped in "propriety "—soaked in it?
Pouf! Gallic lungs cannot breathe, they are choked in it.
Ne'er will he rise to the true Ideality
Whilst he is weighted with stupid Morality.
Painter, it hangs on his Philistine neck a log,
Poet, he 's dragged to the earth by the decalogue;
While he is frixhtened of Nature and Nudity,
Slave he must be to Convention and Crudity.
Two things are worthy of high Art capacity—
Painting bare limbs and describing salacity.
Art that's not hinged on these points in banality;
No inspiration is found in Morality!
BULL is so fond of his sweet domesticities,
Calm honied courtships, and baby felicities,
Treackle-pot passion, and coarse cockney drollery.
Art? A mere compound of clap-trap and foolery!
Art that gives not with minutest eiplicitness
Details of passion in piquant illicitness,
Virginal vice and mature sensuality,
Can't be true Art, for it smacks of Morality.
Art must be free; that's the sine qua non, you see
(Some Britons own it,—they are getting on you see).
Art owneth nought as a bond, chain, or band meant,
Save this,—it must deal with the Seventh Commandment.
Art without that theme to batten and tarry on,
Pines, like a fly in the absence of carrion.
Bondage to dirt? Nut at all. Ideality
Finds nothing bornf about immorality!
THE OLD GOLDEN AGE.—Ladies are wearing "old Gold." Whei
husbands grumble at these new cases of waist, their wives, being on,
or rather in, their metal, reply that " it is good for home trade, the
mode not being French, but thoroughly John-Bullionish." "'Van-
tage they win," as we say at Lawn-Tennis.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

Monday, July 26 (Lords).—Their Lordships had a chat over the
Second Reading of the Wild Birds' Protection Law Amendment Bill,
moved by Lord AIIKRDAKE.
The Duke of ABIIVLL, commending the body of the Bill, criticised
the schedule, which, said His Grace, had been drawn up by some-
body who knew nothing: about the birds it referred to. Nearly half
of their names were synonyms; for example, "lapwing," also
entered "pewit." Besides, he found in it one or two birds of a
very destructive character.
The sparrow-hawk, let us hope, if there is one left; the kite also,
and the buzzard, once common, now rare. Yes, and all the rest of
the Falconidee, and the owls. Never fear, your Grace. Time enough,
if these fine old English birds multiply, to take means for keeping
them under.
Lord WALSINGKAM judiciously pointed out that it was desirable
that a bird should be known in every place by its local name.
As for example "chaffinch," alias "chink, alias "spink." in
different counties. The compiler of the Schedule did, perhaps, know
what he was about, a little, pace the MACCALLUM MORE.
The LORD CHANCELLOR noticed the omission of the kingfisher and
the woodpecker, and suggested that they should be put in. As wild
birds, and wards in Chancery now, of course they will. Why left
out?
The Bill, as amended by their Lordships, was read a Second Time;

thank them. Then Lord SPENCER moved the Second
Heading of the Relief of Distress (Ireland Act Amend-
ment) Bill, and explained its provisions. It also passed
its Second Heading1, and Noble Lords, before adjourning,
forwarded other Bills, not a few.
(Common*.)—Lord HARTINGTON gave a not unsatisfac-
tory account of the state of affairs in Afghanistan, from
which it appeared that the Indian Government, mainly
following out the policy of their predecessors, had squared
it with ABDUR RAHMAN, proclaimed Ameer of Cabul with
their consent and that of the Sirdars. Our troops would,
as soon as possible, retire to a position where they could
keep a look-out; and it was hoped that in the Autumn
they would retire through the passes to India. No
formal engagements had been made with the new Ameer;
he had simply been recognised and offered temporary
assistance to establish his authority. He had been let
know that he must have no relations with any Foreign
Power but ourselves, but, if he took »ur advice, the
British Government would back him against any un-
provoked aggression. A Mahommedan Envoy would be
sent to Cabul, but the Ameer would not be required to
receive a British Resident.
This is meant for an improvement on the policy of
the late Government. Such may it prove. At least, a
Mahometan Envoy is perhaps less likely than a British
Resident to be assassinated.
In answer to a question, the noble Marquis said the
assistance given to ABDUB RAHMAN would be principally
pecuniary.
So everybody no doubt foreboded.
In answer to Lord E. CECIL, Mr. GLADSTONE confessed
that it was quite true that the increased Income-tax,
although not sanctioned by law, had been stopped from
salaries paid to civil servants, and from coupons on
foreign stocks. But, pleaded Our WILLIAM, the practice
had the merit of convenience to sanction it.
So have all the iniquities of the Income-tax. But still
they are at least legal; which makes some difference,
doesn't it, WILLIAM?
Mr. FORSTER at last moved the Third Reading of his
long-debated little Irish Bill, whereon, said he, "Sir,
we have'now had twelve sittings." A little Bill truly
much sat upon. But finally carried by 303 to 237; a
diminuendo majority greeted with Opposition cheers.
Big Ben struck two, and the House adjourned.
Tuesday.—First appearance of Little Irish Bill in the
Lords, and of two giants, the Chinese CHANG and the
Norwegian, with the Dwarf, in the Commons. It was a
tall night, but the Giants found it short commons as an
intellectual feast, and left early. Our Artist took them.
(Vide Illustration.)
Lord NORTON moved and carried the Second Reading of
the Industrial Schools Acts Amendment Bill, chiefly de-
signed for the particular protection of girls under four-
teen; and Lord SUDELEY obtained the same success for
the Merchant Seamen's (Payment of Wages, &c.) Bill-
essentially an anti-crimp Bill, framed to protect poor
JACK from land-sharks of the crimp kind. Lords
ABERDEEN and NORTON very much applauded Lord
SUDELEY'S measure, calculated, no doubt, also to please
Mr. PLIMSOLL.
(Comment, Morning.)—Mr. GLADSTONE attempted to
explain, in answer to Lord R. CHTTKCHILL and Sir H.
WOOLFP, why it had been arranged that Mr. DODSON
should accept the Chiltern Hundreds when he had been
unseated for Chester; but the ease nevertheless seemed
to remain very much an affair of "DODSON and Fog."
Dr. CAMEBON got upon Postal Telegraphs, and in the
Evening, suggested that the public are anxious for "in-
creased telegraphic facilities and diminished charges."
Having got nis answer from Mr. FAWCETT, he withdrew
his Motion.
Colonel BABNE complained of the amount and inci-
dence of the Education-Rate, from which he complained
that the farmers derived no benefit. He moved that a
larger share of the cost of education be defrayed out of
the Imperial Exchequer. Motion seconded by Mr.
BIDDELL, and opposed by Mr. MUNDELLA, who protested
against the disparagement of education and the eulogy
ot ignorance in Colonel BARNE'S speech. The Resolution
in tie farmers' or barn-men's interest was negatived by
114 to 36.
Mr. BIGGAR caused a discussion respecting the alleged
conduct of the Lord Lieutenant of Louth while acting as
\

HEARD IN MID-CHANNEL.

AND MOST OFFENSIVE SPECIMENS OF HUMANITY!"
Fair American. "WELL—AMONO YOUR BRITISH ARISTOCRACY!"
Colonel of the Antrim Militia; misconduct of which, it seems, he was not
culpable. Further legislation was then deferred.
Wednesday (Commons).—The Marquis of HARTINGTON having received a
telegram reporting a terrible disaster to have occurred to the force under General
BURROWS near Candahar, read it to a thin House in dead silence.
The Budget was proceeded with nevertheless. Lord G. HAMILTON moved to
omit the clause increasing the Income-tax by a penny in the pound; but Lord R.
CnuBCHTLL, as the farmers' friend, declined to vote against the means for the
repeal of the Malt-tax, and Mr. GLADSTONE said the success of the Amendment
would render that relief impossible, let alone the relief of Indian difficulties
requiring Imperial assistance. Sir S. NORTHCOTE supported Lord G. HAMILTON,
whose Amendment, however, was rejected by 230 to 94.
As children must be paid for, so must remissions of duties—of course out
of the pockets of the Income-tax payers; for there is now no more taxing the
People. No wonder, then, that they do not object to the Income-tax. A tax
which the People have not to pay is necessarily popular.
The Marquis of HABTINGTON read two further telegrams encouraging tie hope
that "annihilation " was too strong a word to describe the calamity which had
befallen General BUREOWS'S brigade. The House, with some slight sense of
relief, adjourned.
Thursday (Lords).—Authorised by the QUEEN, Lord GRANVTLLE, in reply to
Lord STANLEY or ALDERLEY, stated that his Royal Mistress had sent the SULTAN
a message "in which she expressed a firm hope that, even at a sacrifice, he
would accede to the unanimous wishes of Europe." "Don't you wish you may
get it, Ma'am?" is the answer which, in an Oriental form, the Padishah will
perhaps not dare to return to Her Majesty's letter, only because he may possibly
apprehend that there is something to be read between the lines.
Answering the Duke of SOMERSET, Lord GRANVILLE announced that
grave as was the affair at Candahar, it had been exaggerated in the first
accounts. The last account from Afghanistan will be heavy for JOHN'S pocket.
A sad reverse, whatever the details may be, but, apparently, not quite
amounting to an Afghan Isandlana.

Friends. "BUT DIDN'T YOU DENY IT I"
The Unseated. "CBBTAINLY—MOST EMPHATICALLY BUT—THEY AH—PBOVED

WISDOM OF EXPERIENCE.
T SIB,—I am sorry to say I am old enough to remember
a time considerably previous to the birth of most of my
acquaintance. I recollect in particular the day in which
many people's minds became possessed with an idea that
we had entered on an era of peace and progress, and
philanthropists fondly prophesied the approaching' cessa-
tion of war, and the abolition of capital punishment.
As to war, their amiable predictions, which I always
derided, were very soon falsified by a succession of
tremendous conflicts, and now, instead of turning- swords
into plough-shares, nation is striving- against nation to
construct monster cannon, ironclads, and torpedoes. So
much for war, and, as regards the other necessary usage
whose abandonment was foretold by many mawkish
sentimentalists, any of those simpletons still surviving:
may learn late wisdom from this recent item of foreign
intelligence:—
"CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN SWITZERLAND.—The Great
Council of the canton of Schwytz, in voting the restoration of
capital punishment, has decided that executions shall be public.
Capital punishment has now been restored in four cantons—
Unterwalden, Appenzell, Uri, and Schwjtz."
I always contended that Society could not get on with-
out the gallows. When I say the gallows, I mean the
guillotine also, and its other equivalents. Now they have
tried the experiment of disusing it in Switzerland, and
you see with what success. When milksops used to talk
to me about what they called the hopes of humanity, I
always told them that there was no hope for humanity
whatever; for human nature was human nature, and
plague, pestilence, and fire, battle, murder, and sudden
death—the latter occasionally inflicted by the execu-
tioner—would continue till the end of time. I doubt
not you will sympathise with the extreme satisfaction
which the foregoing confirmation of foresight and of the
feeling that is father to prevision, affords an aged philo-
sopher who always was, and is, and ever will be, an out-
and-out and thorough-going PESSIMIST.
P.S.—I am glad we in this country were not such fools
as to try the experiment of suspending " sus. per coll."
DEAN STREET, SOHO AND SOHOT.—They use a " pun-
kah" at the Royalty Theatre. Is it considered to be a
satisfactory way of raising the wind?
On Motion for going into Committee on the Relief of Distress
(Ireland) Bill, Lord EMLY, supported by Lords DUNHAVEN and
POWEHSCOTTRT, besought the Government to devise a scheme of State
emigration.
Lord SPENCER said that the feelings of the Irish people were
opposed to compulsory emigration, and that the Irish Boards of
Guardians possessed large powers of encouraging PAT to emigrate.
If poor PADDY could consult his own inclinations, an "Irish
Exodus" would mean staying at home.
Their Lordships then put the Bill into Committee and passed it
through, pushed some other Bills on a peg, and adjourned.
(Commons.)—The Marquis of HARTINGTON, touching the Candahar
disaster, repeated the statement made by Lord GBANVILLE to the
Peers; and recited telegrams in detail.
Sir C. DILKE, in reply to Mr. MONK, said the Porte had answered
the Collective Note bv declining to cede Larissa, Janina, and
Metzovo; but proposed new negotiations for settlement of the
frontier, and general details.
The Porte seems not to perceive that a European Round Robin
means that its signataries have had enough of negotiations, and
don t intend to stand any more delay, during which the frontier will
remain as utterly unsettled as the state of the Turkish dominions
altogether.
On the Order of the Day for the Second Reading of the Hares and
Rabbits Bill, Mr. GLADSTONE and Lord ELCHO, between them,
created a laugh. The former presented a petition from 127 Hadding-
tonshire farmers for the Bill, and the latter a petition against it
from Sir T. GLADSTONE. "A little more than kin. and less than
kind,' apparently.
a.r.Tiis *he qilestion concerning " ground game," which exercised
the Collective Wisdom for so many hours, like a kernel? Because
it lies in a nut-shell. Is it, or is it not, necessary to debar a bad
landlord from driving a hard bargain which will force his tenant to
keep the hares and rabbits on the estate he farms sufficiently under
to prevent them from ravaging his crops in a ruinous measure, and
thus constituting themselves a plague of noxious vermin worse than
any rats and mice, and as bad, almost, if not quite, as locusts and
Colorado beetles and the Phylloxera t
Friday (Lords).—On the Motion for the Third Reading of the
Relief of Distress (Ireland) Bill, a dialogue between Lords POWEBS-
COUKT and KIMBERLEY on the subject of Emigration reverted to by
the former Peer, and pooh-poohed by the latter. After that the Bill
was read a Third Time and passed.
The Second Reading of the Limitation of Costs (Ireland) Bill
was moved by Lord STANLEY OF ALDEKLEY, and, on the Motion of
Lord ANNESLEY, rejected.
Is it not much to be wished that some measure could be framed
for the effectual Limitation of Costs (Ireland) P
(Commons, Morning.)—Hares and Rabbits Bill on for Second Read-
ing. Abused by Lord ELCHO in good set terms as a "monstrous abor-
tion," which would demoralise everybody concerned, encourage fraud,
and make the relations of landlord and tenant intolerable. Defended
by Sir W. HAHCOURT, who gave Lord ELCHO as good as he brought,
and, obiter, chaffed BRAND. The match between these two opposite
champions over, on the recommendation of Sir 8. NORTHCOTE, the
Bill was read a Second Time. Pitched battle and row to come on
the Third Reading.
(Evening.)—An attempt at a sitting, but, before any business could
be done, tne House counted and the seance snuffed out.
Sra,
Very Necessary.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.
GUY'S IN DISGUISE!
As there seems to be some rumoured conflict of authority at a
well-known London Hospital, Mr. Punch bega to publish a ru vised
"List of Regulations."
THE MEDICAL STAFF.
There shall be four Physicians, who shall have unlimited rx>wer,
exercisable (as a matter of form) at the discretion of the Taking-in
Committee, the Treasurer, the Librarian, the Sisters and Nurses, the
Chaplain, and the Matron.
These Physicians shall be required to visit the Patients at least
two fixed days in every week, and shall appoint their own days,
subject only to the courteous consent of the Clerk and Registrar, the
Surveyor, the Porter, the Sub-Porter, the Night Watchman, the
Messenger, and the Matron.
The Physicians shall each in rotation have charge of the Clinical
Wards, and shall deliver a Clinical Lecture at least once a week. The
subjects of these lectures shall be left to their own choice, after re-
ceiving the perfunctory sanction of the Chaplain, the Bathmen, the
Janitor, the Engineer, the Engineer's Assistant, and the Matron.
The Assistant Physicians shall help the Physicians, and shall be
completely under their control, subject only to the occasional inter-
ference of the Museum Keeper, the Museum Keeper's Assistant, the
Sisters, the Nurses, the Baker, the Cook, and the Matron.
There shall be four Surgeons, who shall perform the necessary
operations, under the nominal supervision of the Trustees, the
Governors, the Chaplain, the Surveyor, and the Matron.
The Assistant Surgeons shall act under the orders of the Surgeons,
of course subject to the purely friendly guidance of the Nurses (day
and night), the Chaplain, the Engineer's Assistant, and the Matron.
The Dental Surgeon shall extract teeth and lecture on Dental
Surgery at such times as may be really considered advisable by the
Messenger, the Baker, the Back-Gate Porter, and the Matron.
The Aural Surgeon, the Pathologist, the Medical and Surgical
Registrars, the Apothecary and Dispensers, and the Laboratory Man
shall be perfectly independent of all control, provided only that they
accept the periodical hints of the Janiter, the Librarian, the Museum
Keeper, the Museum Keeper's Assistant, the Sisters, the Chaplain,
the Clerk and Registrar, and the Matron.
The Medical Staff shall order what they please, in hope (if not in
faith) of seeing those orders obeyed. In consideration of this perfect
freedom of action, they will be held responsible by everybody for
everything with the hearty and entire consent of the Governors, the
Trustees, the Treasurer, the Taking-in Committee, the Sisters, the
Nnrsea, and the Matron.
THE NUBSING STAFF.
The Matron shall be subject in all things to the wishes of the
Lady Superintendent. To prevent confusion, however, the Matron
and the Lady Superintendent shall be exchangeable terms referring
to the same official. This regulation shall be enforced with the
utmost rigour at all times and on every occasion.
The Sisters shall pay the greatest possible deference to the utter-
ances of the Medical Staff. They shall invariably allow those utter-
ances to enter at one ear and to exit by the other. They shall
consider themselves entirely at the disposal of the Medical Staff
when they have obtained the consent of their immediate Superior.
The Nurses shall follow the lead of the Sisters, and shall submit
themselves in all things to the orders of the Doctors, when those
orders have originated with the Matron.
Thus the Medical Staff will learn to work harmoniously with the
Nursing Staff, and a clashing of authority will obviously be a matter
of almost insurmountable difficulty.
THE PATIENTS.
The Patients shall cheerfully accept the treatment ordered by the
Physicians, misunderstood by the Nurses, referred to the Taking-in
Committee, supported by the Surgeons, edited by the Governors, and
generally revised by the Matron.
They shall willingly undergo any necessary inconvenience inci-
dental to the situation. They shall be glad to have their beds made
shortly after daybreak. They shall never object to the absence of
their guardians at the hours set apart for meals and moral exercises.
They shall train themselves to welcome new faces, and shall never
fret for the companionship of nurses removed to other wards for the
sake of variety, They must remember that such little troubles
must be goodnaturedly accepted, to enable the Sisters and their sub-
ordinates to perform the duties assigned to them to the entire satis-
faction of the Framer of the Rules, Regulations, and Observances.
In conclusion, should any Patient show practically his or her dis-
approval of a system at first sight rather suggestive of a divided
authority, of a kingdom within a kingdom, of a quarrel between
Healers and Attendants, of a dispute between Doctors and Nurses,
he or she shall be immediately dismissed from the Hospital with the
tacit consent of the Governing Body and through the immediate
agency of the Undertaker!
IRISH NOTIONS OF NOTES.
HE patriotic Mr. PETER
SHERIDAN, "a Dublin
merchant for forty-five
years," arrived at six
o'clock on Saturday
evening, at the St. Pan-
eras Station.
He tendered a £3-
note of the Bank of
Ireland in the restau-
rant, in payment of
refreshments. This ten-
der was refused by the
young ladies behind the
bar. They referred Mr.
PETER SHERIDAN to the
Station-Mas ter.
The Station-Master
told Mr. PETER SHERI-
DAN that he would not
take Irish notes. Mr.
PETER SHERIDAN told
the Station-Master " the
note was a Bank of
Ireland "—note under
stood.
The Station-Master
replied that he did not
care.
Having related the
foregoing particulars in
a letter to the Times,
Mr. PETER SHERIDAN
adds:—
"My answer was that it was a poor compliment to Ireland, and that I
would henceforth refuse any payment tendered by Bank of England note!,
and would recommend every man, woman, and child in Ireland, through the
Press, to do likewise."
Is it not too probable that some, if not most, of Mr. PETER
SHERIDAN'S debtors, if they suppose him likely to be as good as his
word, will, whenever they offer to discharge their obligations to him,
in the amount of from £5 upwards, make a point of always tendering
him Bank of England notes?
Mr. PETER SHERIDAN is perhaps descended from ancestors com-
memorated in the stock Irish anecdote, according to which, once
upon a time, the inhabitants of a certain district in his native land,
bearing a grudge against a local banker, and wishing to spite him,
collected for that purpose as many of his notes as ever they could,
and then burnt them.

HIGH AND MIGHTY.
Two Strangers paid a visit last week to the House of Commons.
They were, it is believed, the most exalted personages who have
ever passed within the walls of the House.
They were of the highest standing in Society.
They had the loftiest demeanour.
They were far above all Party differences and divisions.
They could look down on the most conspicuous and eminent
Members of the House.
The Standing Orders of the House greatly excited their curiosity.
They inquired with a personal interest about the Long Parliament.
The Tory benches wished they had such allies to stand up for the
Constitution, against the revolutionary Hares and Rabbits Bill. (The
only drawback that seemed to suggest itself was that they might
get to high words.)
Everybody appears to have been polite and attentive to them, but
even if they had suffered any slight or neglect, they could have
overlooked it.
They looked over the House.
They went away highly pleased with their reception, did—
The Chinese Giant (8 ft. 6 in.) and the Norwegian Giant (8 ft. 4 in.),
each of them fully entitled to bear before his name the letters H.R.H.,
i.e., His Real Highness.
ONE FOR TANNER.

this country, I 'd commit him for getting his livelihood without
ostensible means of subsistence."

THE RIFF-RAFF PIRATE!
(A Fragment of a River Romance.)

'*~ SIB ABET gave another yet
wilder and more convulsive
lurch, and his wife, pale and
trembling, held the light again
above his distorted features. The (food old Vicar, kindly and
silent, marked the changes of his guilty sleep with the attentive
air of one who has seen much but has understood little. He drew
a step nearer, and then gently asked, "And is this bis usual habit
of slumber ?)J
He would have been answered by an icy nod, had not the restless
sufferer at that moment bounded up with another shriek.
The sleeper was sitting erect now, and was staring vacantly
towards the foot of his couch into the space beyond. "1 see another
of 'em. Put on the steam! In to him!" he chuckled horribly to
himself. "Now we shall do it! Forward we go! Ha! ha I Cut
him down to the water's edge! Ha! ha! ha! Capital! Capital!"
He sank back exhausted with merriment, but quickly rallied. In
another instant he had seized a pillow, and was gazing savagely over
the side of the bed. "Six of 'em floundering this time I That's a
good 'un! But d'ye think I "m going to let the life-buoy go over
the weir? Not if I know it!" He hid the pillow as he spoke, and
turned to_ the other side as if in fierce altercation. "What's the
matter with you, eh?" he asked, laughing, as if in enjoyment of
some tragic joke. "Can't swim, can't yer? Yah! Then why don't
you learn? Ha! ha! Steam away! For'ard there! There's
another of 'em ahead! Now—in we go! Lock 'em! That's
another good 'un! Why, they 're a-drownin' like tadpoles in a
bilin' duck-pond! For'ard!"
The exhausted Baronet fell back. The paroxysm was over. All
was hushed. His wearied wife approached the Vicar, and, with
bated breath, told the dread secret of her suspicion. "It is some
crime of his early years." She gasped, "He must onoe upon a time
have been a diving garotter!"
The kind old Vicar took her hand sadly. "It is worse, I fear,
than that, my good soul!" he responded, with a gentle inflexion in
his voice. "Your husband has had a fearful past."
She looked at him inquiringly. Then he told her the hard and
cruel truth.
"In his youth," he said—" I know it now—he kept a steam-
launch, and diverted himself under the protection of the Rules en-
Joined by the Thames Conservancy!"
A Professional Phrase.
Iw a leader on the Burials Bill, the Morning Post lately observed—
"Everyone who has looked into the subject knows perfectly well that the
Disientera' grievance is a thing pro re natd."
Rather, one would say, pro re denata, so to speak of the subject
of the Hill. The medical student in the old story translated pro re
natd, in a prescription, "for the little thing born," but the fore-
going quotation, apparently, relates to a thing, which, instead of
having just been born, is about to be buried.

CHAPTER X.
WHO SHALL BE FAIREST?
MH. MATTIX remained at Small-Beerjester to do all the work for
the forthcoming party, while the Bishop and Mrs. DOWDIE went up
to London to make various necessary purchases at the Stores.
The structure of the Palace and the plan of the grounds were ad-
mirably adapted for Mrs. DOWDIE'S purpose. Of course Lawn-
Tennis woula be played on the Episcopal Lawn; and as religious
observances were not on any account to be kept out of sight, there
would be a series of short services during the game in the different
courts. In another corner of the garden, bowls of Bishop would be
provided for tie stalwart elderly Gentlemen who might have an
ecclesiastical bias; there would be a circus with some hobby-horses
in the paddock for those who were never happy unless mounted on
their own particular hobby, which each person could bring with him
were he so minded. .
The ceremony of laying the first stone of the new glass houses
would be watched with delight by most of the Ladies, who, interested
in the poultry-yard, were every one of them hen-wires, and would
produce their own prize layers. Should it come on to rain, a portion
of the company could be invited into the billiard-room, when taking
the cue from his wife, the Bishop would exhibit his skill in making
minor canons. There would also be a ploughing match between the
Rural Deans, and if two Ody-Colonial Bishops could be sent in time,
they, with his Lordship of Small-Beerjester, would appear in a
tableau representing the Three Graces.
The Chaplain himself would wait at table, see the dishes care-
fully carried in. and all the arrangements carefully carried out. On
this occasion Mrs. DOWDIE insisted on his wearing his full clerical
official court suit as Domestic Chaplain and Canon, which consisted
of a sombre livery with knee breeches, and artilleryman's boots as a
Canon; high waistcoat, footman's coat, splendidly braided, which
he could not neglect without being splendidly up-braided by Mrs.
DOWDIB,—white tie, a pair of academical brass bands round his
throat, a Master of Arts gown, and a low-crowned hat very much
turned up at the sides with strings and coloured cockade, to revolve
with the wind like a ventilator. It was part of his duty to show the
Ladies into the Bishop's private chapel, which, on account of its
being furnished with luxurious sofas and arm-chairs, was called
the Chapel of Ease, where the Private Chaplain had always to be
in readiness at any hour to preach privately to the Bishop, and
never to stop until the Bishop woke and walked out. Woe be to the
Chaplain who, presuming on the Bishop's somnolence, should sud-
denly drop his discourse. It was the only thing that roused the
excellent Dr. DOWDIE into instant action, and a formidable hassock
was soon sent flying with unerring aim at the neglectful chaplain's
head.
While on the subject of Mr. MATTIX'S duties, it will not be out of
place to add that he had to brush his Lordship's hat every morning,
water the rosette in front, iron the brim, see that all the buttons were
on the episcopal gaiters, and that the apron-strings were strongly
stitched. When Dr. DOWDIE went on a visitation, which the devout
inferior clergy regarded as a visitation of Providence, — he was
accompanied by his wife on the guitar, and his Chaplain, who acted
as courier, taking the tickets, looking after the luggage, and ordering
stalls in the Cathedral three weeks in advance.
Mrs. DOWDIE therefore requested Canon MATTIX to be good enough
to bestir himself and procure a tent, or as she described it, a marquee,
in which some of her visitors could sit during the afternoon party at
the Episcopal Palace; and if he could devise any entertainments to
amuse and astonish her guests in a harmless and inexpensive way he
was at liberty to do so; nay, he was earnestly requested to make a
point of doing so. Mrs. DOWDIE'S request was, of course, a com-
mand; and as it was nothing new for his Lordship's Clergymen to
take their orders from the Bishop's wife, so Mr. MATTIX, bestriding

a sleek cob, for he had not as yet ventured upon the high horse, rode
forth intent on the marquee, which was to be such a feature m the
day's proceedings.
My readers may guess that I myself have no strong partiality for
Mr. MATTIX, yet I must admit that he is a man of parts which might
ordinarily have accounted for his pulling up in front of a booth at a
fair, where a theatrical exhibition was being given within five miles
of Small-Beerjester. Indeed, Mr. MATTIX was meditating many
things in his mind about a Fair, but the Fair that engaged the
Reverend Gentleman's thoughts at this particular moment was the
second daughter of the Beadle of Small-Beerjester, the Percenter,
whom he had been brought there by Mrs. DOWDLE to supplant in his
mastership of Deedler's Trust.
Mr. MATTIX had already placed himself on a friendly footing with
MORLEENA, having pressed her toe twice under the table at the
Bishop's luncheon, and then thrown all the clerical fervour at his
command into his eyes as he offered her the preserved ginger. He
had called one morning at her father's house, and, having watched
his opportunity, had drawn near her, and sat close to her in the
drawing-room. He had entered unexpectedly and hod found her in
deshabille, playing an air by BACH on the piano with her back hair
down. He nad asked her politely, "What air that was?" alluding
to the one she was performing, and she had replied, "My own, of
course! Like your impudence!" when he at once explained that he
did not allude to the" hair of her locks, but to the air on the keys; on
which MORLEENA had blushed deeply, and had shaken out her
tresses; then she had called him " a great big naughty parson," and
had gone straight to the sofa, where she sat down, pouting and sulky,
till Mr. MATTIX, who could adapt the craft of the serpent to the con-
venience of the dove, came and sat down beside her, repeating play-
fully the nursery rhyme about Little Miss Muffet, and hoping that
he, at all events, would not be the spider to " frighten Miss Muffet
away."
MOBLEENA had taken up the rhyme and observed that " buffet"
rhymed to Muffet, and then Mr. MATTIX had retorted that buffet in
French meant a refreshment place, and asked permission to offer her,
in her own house, a glass of sherry, which MORLEENA declined with
thanks, but played at tip-biscuit with him, when Mr. MATTIX in his
eagerness to catch a piece she was about to throw to him, edged
nearer and nearer MORLEENA's seat. And then he had asked her
whether she had heard his latest [sermon in Beerjester Cathedral on
"waist not, want not," wherein he had informed his hearers that
he considered a little waist a very dangerous thing, but had shown
how even a considerable amount of waist might be pressed into the
service of the Church, and how necessary it was to suit the action to
the word and the word to the action; to all of which Miss MOBLEENA
had given her unhesitating assent, being perfectly sure that anything
like dissent on such an occasion would be quite out of place. And
when he left he had given her his best blessing, and had asked her
to get the idea of his being her shepherd thoroughly through her
wool. " and one day," he murmured, " the shepherd may hope for a
shepherdess."
'And will he marry one of his own lambs?" MOBLEKNA had
inquired archly.
To which Mr. MATTIX. becoming quite impassioned, had pressed
her hand, as he replied, Not a lamb ;—Ewe."
To which MORLEENA had made no answer, and Mr. MATTIX was
now thinking over this interview, and was weighing his chances and
calculating his plans as he sat motionless on his cob in front of the
booth of the Fair which was being held on Gosling Green.
As I have already more than hinted, to say that he was attracted
by a Fair in any shape was nothing new; but on this occasion his
attention was arrested, and not unwarrantably, by the appearance
of on elegant female figure dancing on a platform, in front of a
gigantic picture, while two persons in fantastic costumes played a
drum and cymbals, and a third shouted to the crowd a reiterated
invitation to "Walk up!" as they were "just a-going to begin."
Mr. MATTIX was not sufficiently lost in love to be unable to appre-
ciate the exquisite type of Italian beauty which now appeared before
his eyes. Who could she be? this vision of unsurpassed loveliness P
—for as he sat and gazed he was dazzled by a sort of beauty the
like of which he had never before seen, and he was caught by her
easy, free, voluptuous manner, which was perfectly new to him.
He had never been so tempted before: the temptation was irre-

sistible; it carried him away, right out of the saddle
and on to the platform, where he found himself in com-
pany with an Arlecchino, a Pantaleone, the father of his
resplendent charmer, her brother dressed as a Gains-
borough Blue Boy, and a Merry Andrew, who was bow-
ing to him and asking, "What he could go for to fetch
for to carry for to bring," adding that if he had a ticket
from the Church and Stage Guild he must pay extra.
The entire troupe was Italian, and. though perhaps not
peculiar in their own country, would certainly create a
sensation on the lawn of the Episcopal Palace of Small-
Beerjester; for it had suddenly occurred to Mr. MATTIX,
as an inspiration, that in order to account for his pre-
sence on their platform—so different from his own
platform at Exeter Hall—he would explain that he had
come to engage them for a private afternoon performance
at Mrs. DOWDIE'S garden-party, if their engagements
would permit of the arrangement.
The Signora, who appeared to be the Manageress of
the booth, received him in her dressing-room; and, after
giving some orders in an undertone to the Blue Boy,
turned to the enraptured Canon, and assuring him that
his horse would be provided with a good stall in the
first row, motioned him to a seat close by the couch on
which she reclined, beautiful and motionless, in an atti-
tude of the deepest and most earnest attention.
"Excuse my receiving you in this dress," she said, sim-
ply; "but business is business, and this is my costume."
And very becoming her costume was. It was white
muslin, reaching quite to the knees, without any other
garniture than rich yellow roses and pearls across her
bosom, and the same round the scarcely perceptible armlet
of her corsage. Across her brow she wore a tiara of
precious stones that gave additional lustre to her eyes,
which were brilliant as diamonds of the first water, spark-
ling with dazzling effect on each side of her exquisitely-
chiselled nose, which in itself was a perfect mosaic. On
her arms, which her position required her to expose, she
wore several magnificent bracelets; while her perfectly-
fitting fleshings, of the palest pink tint, exhibited to
advantage the marvellous outline of her well-rounded
limbs. Her small feet were encased in the tiniest white
high-heeled satin shoes, set off with large delicately-
coloured rosettes.
Dressed as she was, and looking as she did, so
beautiful, so statuesque, with that lovely head, those
large staring eyes which took everybody in at a glance,
it was impossible that Mr. MATTIX, clergyman though he
was, should not be also numbered among those who were
taken in by those eyes and done for on the spot.
"I must introduce myself," she said, in excellent
English, to which her foreign accent lent an irresistible
charm. "You will see in the bill," and she handed him
a programme, which he received as though he were in
some delicious overpowering dream, "that I am an-
nounced as COLTTMBINA CHIKOLINA. That is not my real
name._ I am the Marchesa di ZAZZEGLIA. The Boy in
Blue is my half brother; the others are my servants;
though Signor PANTALEOXE acts the part of my guardian
pour me aonner contenance."
"Yon are a Marchesa then?" said Mr. MATTIX, softly,
and then mindful of Mrs. DOIVDIE'S commission, he ex-
plained that he was in search of a marquee, and esteemed
himself so happy to have found a Marquise.
She inclined her head towards him pensively, and eyed
him like a she-devil.
The Canon who had never met a she-devil, however,
thought that this was the sort of angel he liked, and
drawing the chair nearer to the sofa, and within reach of
the Signora's dazzling white arm, he assumed the deepest
sympathy and prepared himself to console her, should she
snow any symptoms of being overcome by emotion.
"You do not know my saa story?" she inquired, lay-
ing her hand on his with a light touch that sent a tremor
through his whole frame, and made his hair curl up
crisply like the leaves of a sensitive plant.
Kb, he didn't know a word of it, he stammered, but he
should be happy to hear it.
"I am a Roman by birth," said La Marchesa di ZAZ-
ZEOLIA. "I have the blood of the PUMPKTS in my veins.
That is how I first took to pumps and dancing," and she
kicked one of her little shoes in the air, and then asked
him to replace it on her foot.
The Canon was but a man. What could he do but
place himself at her feet? After all, there was no harm
in his holding the shoe if she were the only one to put her

foot in it P As for his kneeling before her, had not his own shoemaker knelt
before him to try on a new pair, and there was nothing wrong in the act?
"Knee pliu ultra," said the Signora laughingly, as she jerked her foot into its
place, and motioned him to his former seat by her cushion.
"1 was engaged to be married to II Duca di POLICHINELLO," she continued,
earnestly, "a dissolute nobleman who had already killed his first wife. Donna
JULIA, and was accused of such dreadful crimes that rather than be his wife I
sacrificed my position in society, my fortune, everything, and escaped from
Italy, accompanied by the few faithful attendants you have seen with me, and
possessed only of these family jewels which you now see me wearing."
Mr. MATTIX would have examined them more closely, especially the diamond
pendants in her ears, but at the sound of a small bell, the Signora rising suddenly
from the sofa, observed in a low tremulous voice, that he must hear the remainder
of her story another time; and having faithfully promised to bring the tent, the
troupe, and the whole show to the Bishop's garden-party, she quitted the small
apartment where their tete-d-tete had been held, leaving Mr. MATTIX quite
bewildered and struggling into consciousness as though he were awaking from a
deep sleep.

THE NEW DRESSMAKER.
(What it must come to with the present taste for "real" trimmings.)
SCENE.—A. Belgravian Boudoir, Lady ANNE discovered at her toilette table.
Mr. WEEDS is ushered in by a Maid.
Lady Anne. I am not at all satisfied with the dress I wore last night. The
palm-leaves were too heavy, and the camellias faded before the first dance.
As for that lattice-work covered with jasmine you fixed up for me on my skirt—
why, it was coming undone the whole evening.
Mr. Weeds. Very sorry, my Lady, but you said you liked flowers better
than fruit. It is the first complaint I have had, and I garden, as you know,
some of the best blood in town, ,Your Ladyship will remember that I gave
you refusal of the dress worn by the Duchess. It made
quite a sensation, and I 'admit that I felt nervous and
fluttered when I ushered her Grace into the talon.
Lady Anne. The grape-drapery, with its vegetable
marrows and parsnips was certainly pleasing. By the
way, the sudden introduction of the artichokes in, the
tunic was ineffective.
Mr. Weeds. Your Ladyship is right. I frankly ad-
mit that the cucumber required toning down. We ought
to have scattered a pint of peas over the gauze, and em-
phasised the buckles with kidney potatoes. Your Lady-
ship is pleased with the dress your Ladyship is going to
wear to-night? It cost me several hours of the most
anxious thought. I believe, fondly believe, you will
consider the patch of mushrooms worn on the left arm a
masterpiece! As for the vegetables, my Lady, you may
rely upon them. They came fresh this morning from
Covent Garden.
Lady Anne. It might be worse. The bouquets of
carrots and Brussels sprouts are certainly sweet. The
head-dress—a cauliflower in a nest of beetroot—is very
pretty. But are you sure that you can fix it in securely?
Mr. Weeds. Certainly, my Lady. And now, my Lady,
I am sure you will forgive me if combining, as I do,
millinery and greengrocery with the art of waiting at
evening parties, I humbly ask permission to withdraw?
[Exit Mr. WEEDS, to assume his war-paint for the
evening "genteel" conviviality. Scene closes in
as Lady ANNE tries on a dress looking like the
evergreen-covered case used by Jaok-in-the-
Green on May-Day.
SIGNS OF A REVIVAL.
(By a Pessimistic Reader of the Times.)
SCENE—Interior of a Workman's room. The Work-
man's family discovered sadly taking their tea.
Wife. Father has not yet returned! But how could
I expect it? Return to nothing cheerier than tea! That
nation is, indeed, impoverished that cannot afford it«
working-man his pint of beer at regular family intervals!
Eldest Son. Believe me, Mother, better times are at
hand. Trade is, for the moment, under a cloud, but the
sun of prosperity will soon shine out once more, and we
shall be happy. So, cheer up, Mother dear—cheer up I
Eldest Daughter (earnestly). Listen to EDWABD, dear
Mother! We have still much to be thankful for.
Wife (angrily). Thankful for? You mock me!
Eldest Soti (soothingly). May I guess my sister's mean-
ing? She would say that during these years of depres-
sion—when the good old English workman has been so
often forced, for long periods together, to exchange the
cheerful pewter for the nerve-shattering tea-pot—edu-
cation has progressed by leaps and bounds. Look at
ourselves! Time was when we were wont to speak a
coarse, nay, an almost unintelligible jargon, interlarded
with profanity; now our language—creaming, if 1 may
use the image, with family affection, is sugared with
politeness.
Eldest Daughter. Is as polished and to the point as
the reports in a daily newspaper I Ah! what do we not
owe to the School Board!
Wife (bitterly). Not much! We are not allowed to
get into arrears with their rates, and be hanged to 'em I
Eldest Son (reproachfully). Nay, Mother, you are
ungrateful! But, believe me, we have brighter days in
store. Soon this long-con tinned depression will pass
away, and then—(loud noise heard without) Hal
what was that?
Wife. Hush! Tour father!
Enter the Working-man. He repulses his Wife, who
attempts to embrace him, aims a vague but savage
blow at his Son, and tries to pull his Daughter's hair.
Then he kicks over the tea-table with its equipage,
and falls heavily on the floor.
Eldest Son (joyfully). Mother! Mother! all our dark
days are over! Trade is brisk once more!
Wife (eagerly). How do you know it!
Eldest Son. By the surest sign. Father is as jolly
and joyous as of old. (Pointing to Workman, who is
now sleeping htavily.) Shiver the superfluous tea-pot!
Our Father is once more mops and brooms!

(Being short dining-out Stories, carefully selected by our Own Out-and-Out
Diner.)
N.B.—The object is to furnish, under the above heading, for the benefit of
those who, when seated at a dinner-table, never can find anything to say for
themselves, a little entertaining and thoroughly authentic gossip about somebody
else. It is therefore sought, while avoiding any approach to personality, to
provide perfect accuracy combined with an unmistakable cachet. "With this in
view, the task of selection has been confided to a person of title, who has at
his command an abundant leisure backed by a comprehensive discrimination.
But any suitable contributions from people who are still confined to town, will
receive full consideration. The first instalment is subjoined:—
The interest taken by Mr. TOOLE in politics, and the habit he has of frequently
slipping out from his own theatre between every Act, for the purpose of listening
to a bit of some debate in the House of Lords, often leads him into amusing
complications. Only the other night, hearing that the Chinese Giant had. by
his mere height, given himself a capital advertisement in the Strangers' Gallery
in the Commons, the clever comedian on pushing his way in and taking his
accustomed place, instantly stood conspicuously on the seat. An Irish Member
below the gangway calling the Speaker's attention to the fact, the latter, who

came in with a Standing Order," was the pointed but pleasant reply. The
SPEAKER went back to his chair in fits.
******
The economical stable arrangement of a certain well-known sporting Peer
being discussed in connection with his rather serious illness the other evening
in the tea-room, Lord ROWTON, whose official experience in dealing with the
Cabmen's Reform Association has made him perhaps one of the best living judges
in England of the peculiar points of a hack, was commenting, though in no
unkindly spirit, on the stinginess of the nobleman in question. "My dear
MONTY," said Lord BEACOXSFIELD, who came up at the
moment, "don't imagine that death has any terrors for
him. "Why, you forget, his coffin will be full of
screws!"
*****
The inveterate habit of button-holing and then quoting
a bit of the Latin Grammar to any leading actor he
chances to come across, for which the Head Master of
the Blue-coat School is chiefly distinguished among his
intimate friends, led, the other morning, to a brilliant
little passage of arms outside the establishment of a
well-known West-End hairdresser. Happening to meet
the accomplished lessee of the Lyceum on the door-step,
and the situation naturally suggesting a reference to the
advertised programme of the coming season, the great
City scholar, slapping his acquaintance familiarly on the
shoulder, said, in his usual dry manner, " Corsicos odi
puer apparatus! which means, mv boy, you had better
nave stuck to the legitimate—and Terry! Come, find
something to cap that, if you can." '' What do you
say," replied the amiable tragedian, smiling pensively,
"to my possibly having found, after all, a rarer avis in
Terriss!" On this being retailed, the same evening, to
Lord BBABOUHNE, he instantly said, "Well, if that isn't
the best thing that has been heard outside the Athenaeum
this fifty years, I know nothing of JUVENAL!"
Loid KIMBERLEY'S aptitude for communicating a
despatch in the shape of an impromptu epigram, has got
him, before now, into hot water with more than one
Colonial Governor; and, on the Cabinet coming to its
recent decision to recall Sir BABTLE FREHE, he deter-
mined to surpass himself. Taking up his pen, without
a moment's hesitation he jotted down the following:—
"Though rated out there as a seer,—over here
We 're rated because we won't doubt you;
So you'd belter come home, for with us'you 're still Frere,
While we shall feelfrte-er without you!"
When this reached the Cape, by cable, Sir BARTLE
was taking lunch with a distinguished German personage.

MONDAY, August 2 (Lords).—"Proputty, proputty, proputty!"
Pitched battle among the Peers over the Compensation for Disturb-
ance (Ireland) Bill; prodigious press of Peeresses to witness the first
round,
“In their gay fal-lal-eries,
They thronged the galleries,
And filled the passages, and choked the floor-ways;
Peers' wives and daughters,
Crushed in closest quarters,
And sat contented in the open doorways."
Fancy a Peeress sitting in a doorway-and probably a draught,
to hear an Irish Bill discussed i Patience on a monument smiling at
| Grief, seems nowhere in comparison.
PLIMSOLL'S ADIEU !

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
AB a preliminary. Lord KIMBERLEY announced that the
Government had decided to recall Sir BABTLE THERE,
the Great First Fiddler's instrument not being entirely
in tune with the Government orchestra.
Then Earl GBANVTLLE suavely and suasively moved
the Second Reading of the Bill, whose character he
described as follows:—
"The Bill in effect provides that where the only reason wh)
the tenant cannot pay hia rent is the unusual failure of the
harvests, when the tenant is willing to make reasonable terms
with his landlord as to rent, arrears of rent, and otherwise, and
•when such terms hare been refused by the landlord without any
offer of a reasonable alternative, then the use of one of his reme-
dies—a remedy to enforce the tenant's contract with himself,
which i« not possessed by English and Scotch landlords—will be
suspended for a term not exceeding sixteen months, after which
it can be resumed."
The Bill — like a Bobby's beat — was limited as to
area" and "time." Its principle was not "novel,"
though charged with being "sensational." He was
sorry to hear that Lord GREY was about to resume his
rule of " Chucker-out" to the proposed measures of his
own party; but as he had been at it for a quarter of a
century, Liberal grief on that score was a mitigated woe.
Lord OBEY proved his love of the Liberal party, as
usual, by sharply chastening it. Turning his face to
the Opposition Benches, he lashed out behind, like a less
noble animal.
"Turn thia way—they are converted," blandly sug-
gested Lord GRANVILLE; whereupon Lord OBEY faced
round upon "his friends, the enemy." As a pendant
to Lord GRANVILLE'S couleur-de-rose sketch, he described
the Bill as one for suspending the power of getting
rents, and, in that character, opposed it.
Lord EMI.Y thought that—
"Apt exaggeration'i artful aid
Had made the Peers of this poor Bill afraid."
The Marquis of LANSDOWNE credited the Government
with Good Intentions, but must decline to tread with
them the road of which these were proverbially the pave-
ment. What was "a reasonable alternative" for the
landlord? "Between the devil and the deep sea" was
the nearest definition he could hit upon. If this Bill
were passed, we should have no more line weather in
Ireland.
The EARL OF DERBY (more suo) was moderate and
mediatorial. Rather than accept the Bill as it stood,
indeed, he would help kick it out, but "on the whole
(the favourite formula of such minds as the Earl's) he
was in favour of encouraging the poor thing, and amend-
ing it in Committee—that Parliamentary purgatory where
peccant Bills are purged of clinging frailties, and pre-
pared for the Elysium of the Statute Book.
The Marquis of SALISBURY thought the Bill a por-
tentous combination of Sphinx, Proteus, and Chimera.
Its genesis had been perplexing, and he hoped for its
speedy exodus. "Be just (to the Landlords), and fear
not" (the Land League), should be the motto of the
House of Lords.
(N.B.—This high-sounding motto, borrowed from Mr.
GLADSTONE, does not, of course, apply to Foreign affairs,
my Lord!)
Alter some defensive remarks from Earl KIMBEBLEY,
the House, on the Motion of Earl CAIRNS, adjourned at
five minutes to twelve o'clock.
(Commons.)—The House was shocked by the announce-
ment of the grave indisposition of Mr. GLADSTONE, (Upon
his happy recovery therefrom, Mr. Punch, and a re-
lieved country, cordially congratulate the Right Honour-
able Gentleman—and themselves.)
In Committee of Supply on the Civil Service Estimates,
Mr. MUNDELLA moved the vote of £1,466,077 to complete
the sum necessary for Public Education for the financial
year. Interesting review of the progress in education
during the decade that has elapsed since the passing: oi
the Education Act. General chorus of praise to the Vice-
President of the Privy Council.
"For he's a jolly MUNDELLA,
And so say all of us!"
Vote agreed to. House adjourned at 2'25.
Tueiday (ionfo).—Debate on the Big-Little Irish Bill
resumed. For hard upon three hours did Chief Gunner
CAIRNS fire forensic shot into it until the "riddle" (in

AND HEARS ALL WE DO, AND BEFORE WHOM EVSX I AM BUT A8 A CRUSHED
WORM?"
Page. "THE Missuf, MY LOBD I"
Lord SALISBURY'S sense) was riddled indeed (in an artilleryman's). He thought
(to summarise seven columns in as many .lines) it would impair the fixed principles
of "proputty," in deference to an unproven emergency, unfairly tax the
pockets of a small section of the public, raise the sordid passions of the
peasantry, and drive away Capital from Ireland.
Lord SELBOBNE characterised the Earl's seven columns as " observations."
"Let 'observations' with extensive view.
Survey the Bill, and say it will not do."
He, Lord SELBOBNE, thought it would. He rather fancied Earl CAIHNS,
like certain Wimbledon marksmen, had been scoring bulls'-eyes (which did not
count) on the wrong target, peppering a phantom Bill of his own imagination
quite different from the one actually before the House.
Lord CBANBBOOK, with his accustomed heat, threw cold water on the Bill,
the Duke of ABGYLE as warmly defended it.
The Earl of BEACONSFLELD was retrospective, preferring, apparently, the
calm pleasures of Memory to the nattering tales of Hope, or the delusive
delights of Imagination. He informed a listening Senate that it was "a busy
age." and a "rapid," that we had got into a pernicious habit of forgetting
world-shaking events,—which took place five years ago (the Devon Commission,
for example),—that "new ideas" were not so omnipotent as some people im-
agined, and that the despotism of public opinion required tempering — by
Disraelian epigram, of course. He, also incidentally, opposed the BUI.
After a brief reply from Lord GRANVILLK, the House divided. The Great
Proputty Fight ended in a majority of 231 against the Bill (Contents 51, Non-
Contents 282); and the Peers, having once more "saved their country,"
and "earned the.gratitude of posterity," broke up at twenty-five minutes
to two.
(Common*.)—Here, upon the Employers' Liability Bill was wagod by lesser

themselves wonderfully liberal—of disinterested advice to the Government—
Liberal Capitalists proved remarkably Conservative — of their own special
interests. Highly interesting masquerade of political emotions.

lahmael (Tory) stood in fixed "surprise."
"Sorrow*' brought tears to Abdiel'B (Liberal) eyes;
Official "Indignation" had to cope
With Capital's "Despair," and Labour's angry " Hope."
Progress was reported, though little had be«n made, and the House
adjourned at half-past one.
Wednesday (Commons.) —The House assembled at twelve o'clock'
went into Committee on the Employers' Liability Bill, and lengthy
discussion of the doctrine of " Common Employment," which " doc-
trine" was canvassed with as much heat as though it had been a
theological one, warring interests being to the full as cantankerous
as contending creeds.
Oh! Capital's unselfish zeal for Labour lovingly forthshines,
When "Mines" (for "Railways ") lay down rules, or "Railways " fashion
laws (for " Mines.")
Moral of the Sitting, which was suspended at six o'clock.
Thursday (Lords).—Half an hour's sitting; Epping Forest Bill,
and Wild Birds Protection Law Amendment Bill, pushed fairly
through. Little cry and a fair share of wool.
(Commons.)—Torture by question liberally (and Conservatively)
applied to Government. In reply to an insidious inquiry from Mr.
PARNELL, Mr. FORSTEH intimated that, the loss of the Disturbance
Bill notwithstanding, the Government must support the law in
Ireland, but hoped the landlords would be moderate in their appeals
to it.
Personal explanations between Mr. BOTJBKE and Sir (' 11 \n i. KS DIIKF.
(on behalf of the Premier) concerning the alleged jealousy of the
Powers, notably France, on the subject of the Anglo-Turkish Con-
vention, and the improper suppression of evidence of that jealousy
by the late Government. Like most personal explanations, it seemed
to need—explaining.
Lord HABTINGTON detailed certain proposed arrangements for the
conduct of the business of the House, against which everybody, of
course, felt it his duty (and pleasure) incontinently to protest. Mr.
FOESTER pathetically complained that the time of the House was
being wasted.'.'.' FOHSTEH, my lad, you lack humour I The motto of
the Obstructives (Irish and Ishmaelitish) is "Never allow to be
postponed till to-morrow what yon can wrangle over to-day."
Then more disinterested dialectics on the Employers' Liability Bill,
cut short, to Lord R. CHURCHILL'S great disgust, by what he called
"a mere Irish row," the discussion, namely on Mr. MCCARTHY'S
Motion for the reconstruction—in the interest of the Irish Tenant-
Farmers—of the Irish Land Commission, which Motion was lost, on
division, by 74.
Friday (Lords).—The Peers talked for two hours, or so, about
Acoustics and reporting. They objected to having a reporter wheeled
about on the floor of their House to catch their Lordships' speeches.
If no alteration is made, Reporters will be provided with ear-
trumpets.
(Commons, Morning.)—Lord R. CHCRCHILL interrogative (Jest Id
son mftier) about his clients, the Turks, and Concerted Coercion.
Sir C. DILKE thought it would be wrong—and rude—to consider
prematurely the "improbable hypothesis" that the former would
render the latter necessary. Mr. ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (another
incarnate Note of Interrogation) raised the old Bogey of "Millions
of Indian Mahomedans "Til which Lord 11 AKTIM. i DX, in the most
cold-blooded manner, straightway floored.
(Evening.)—Mr. ARNOLD moved for relaxation of the restrictions
on the Importation of Foreign Cattle. Mr. JACOB BRIGHT thought
the Motion "wise." Mr. CHAPLIN swore it was "wanton." Mr.
MUNDHLLA, on behalf of the Government, said "non possumus,"
earning thereby Sir STAFFORD NOHTHCOTE'S deep gratitude, and the
Motion was negatived by 194 to 20.
Then the House (to avoid the supplementary purgatory of a
Saturday Sitting on " contentious business") resumed discussion of
the Employers' Liability Bill, and wound up its week's work at
twenty-rive minutes past three.
Ah me! if our Senators, ancient and young,
Were less short of temper, and less long of tongue

THIS is how I come for
to be a Waiter.
My Father was a Green.
Grocer, and wen the
Swells as we served with

Party, Father went as a
Waiter or a Butler, as
the case might be. Wen
I seed him drest in his
lovely soot of Black, and
his beautieful white
Choker, looking for all
the world like a Bishop
without his apron, my
hart was fird with Am-
hishun, and I said to
myself, if it is so grand
to be a meet Ammytoor
Waiter, what must it be
to be a reglar Perfes-
shnnal! So a Waiter I
become, always having
before me the possi-
bilerty of one day amer-
ging, like a crisliss from
a grubb or wisy wersy,
into a full blone Foot-
man to a Sheriff or even a Lord Mare! But this is a vishun not to
be reelised!
The fust thing as struck me when I began my offishal dooties, was
the wonderfool amount of confedens shown to us by everyboddy as
we waited on. The most secret hax, the most dangerus sentimens,
in the most outspokenest langwidge, was talked of freely before
us, as if we was all Def I My friend BROWN, who's a bit of a
Sinnio, says it's all Contemp; I say it's all Confedense, and nothink
therefore shall flow from my pen and ink, that the most fastidious
Warden can objeok to. I 'm a true Conservatif. I want no change,
and never wants to give none.
How can I help being a Conservatif, wen every week I hears all
the loyal Toasts given four or five times, with almost teers of effec-
shun and revrense? Then comes the Army and the Navy and the
Wollunteers, and don't the Chairman, whoever he may be, pour out
the melted butter pretty thick? Praps tho the man above all men as
I oontinuelly hears spoken ighest of is, "my Right Honerrable frend
the LORD MARE," as the Chairmen all calls him. What wonderful
chaps them Lord Mares all seems to be! Every one is allus better
than the last one, so what they will sum day kum to, who can say?
BROWN says, in his snearing way, "Wot a rum lot them must
have bin as is past and gone!"
Wot a life of luxery and pride is a Lord Mare's 1 Fancy reel
Turtel Soup five nights a week! The idear is too gorgeous to realise.
I loves my City Press, and why'( Beeos every Saturday it gives
a bootifnl account of all the grand City dinners, which takes up
neerly harf the paper, and direoly it cnms, my eldest boy, who is
gittinga cappital Eddicashun at somebody else's expence, expounds
it all to me, and I am abel to say to almost all on 'em, "My children,
I were there!"
It's always orful impressive to hear the profound silence while the
Turtel is rapidly disappeering. Then the Aldermen arks one another,
"How were the Turtel to-night?" "Not quite equal to last
night's," or " Simply perfect," as the case may be. As far as Turtel
goes, Aldermaniacks 1 call 'em.
I herd one wuthy Alderman say the other night at the Gold-
smiths, "What a merciful dispensashun of Providens it is, that
Turtel and Wenson should be as wholesome as they are serumpshus I"

Yours, not sheepishly,
A MEMBER OF THE BAA.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
(The Colonel on Brighton Bubbles and Canterbury Cajoleries.)
HAVING promised to furnish you occasionally with hints upon
Sporting, need I say I attended Brighton Races!
The journey down was not uneventful. The sole occupant of my
compartment (beside of course myself) was a person of innocent
appearance, who after discussing Hospital Sunday, the Benevolent
Institutions of London, and other interesting topics of conversation,
invited me, when we reached East Croydon, to play a little game of
ecarte. I agreed, when judge of my horror, after a couple of deals,
I discovered that my apparently simple-minded fellow traveller
was nothing less than a Card Sharper! I laid my plans accord-
ingly. As a matter of common precaution, I invariably carry a few
Kings concealed up the sleeves of my coat (if you knew the world
as well I do. my dear young Friend, you would do the same), and
with this advantage in my favour, I soon succeeded in foiling his
iniquitous devices. Having lost some of his ill-gotten gains, the
scoundrel wished to give up play, and to return to the discussion of
Hospital Sunday, the Benevolent Institutions of London, and other
interesting topics of conversation. It was then that I withered him
with my scorn, and painted him in his true colours. I pointed out
to him that travellers were cautioned by the officials of the Railway
Company to beware of fellows of his stamp, and threatened to give
him into custody at the next station. He was deeply moved, and
promising immediate amendment, appealed to me for mercy. His
tears convinced me of the sincerity of his repentance. Feeling,
however, that I must not compound a felony, I as a Magistrate (I
am on the Commission of the Peace for , but this is a detail),
imposed the fine, and smiled graciously, while I pocketed his money.
Is it necessary to add, Sir, that the tine thus solemnly imposed, will
be expended to the uttermost farthing in true charity—which begins
at home? No, Sir. I hope not!
Arrived at Brighton. Sir, in spite of the lassitude of the Police,
the scepticism of the Municipal Authorities, the indifference of the
Public Prosecutor, I insist that the notorious gambling-houses, the
dens of dissipation and gambling are no myth, no horrible trick of
a heated imagination! I myself am a living proof to the contrary.
In the course of a couple of days (would you oelieve it, Sir ?) I was
turned out of all of them!
Utterly disgusted with Brighton town, on Thursday I left it
to visit the Race Course. The company were neither numerous
nor select. The boxes of the Grand Stand were occupied chiefly
by baskets of flowers, and in the carriages en face was an assort-
ment of paintings in rouge and blanc de perle, mounted apparently
in frames of Worth. These paintings appeared to me, Sir, to
be very indifferent "studies of flesh colour." The county nota-
bilities were conspicuous by their absence. It was quite a relief
to leave "the nobility and gentry of the district" to mix with
"the common people. Here was a vendor of a mysterious com-
pound called "Okey Pokey," and there a sharp American engaged
in puzzling the county constabulary (who were crowding amicably
around hum) with a Yankee edition of "the three-card trick." I
heard an aged Sergeant of Police observe, d propos of this last feat,
that "he (the Sergeant) couldn't imagine how he (the American)
could think of such clever things!" But the most interesting people
on the course in my eyes were some half a dozen worthy fellows
marking race-cards, and giving tips at sixpence the consultation!
One of these "prophets" was a most finished orator. He gave his
autobiography. He had been a surgeon, then a jockey, then a
trainer, then a gentleman, then the proprietor of numerous "'orses."
He was now, apparently, a millionnaire, and certainly the servant of
the public. As the servant of the public he was ready to mark race-
cards and give tips, naming the absolute winners for the races—all
for the ridiculous sum of sixpence.
And now, my dear young friend, if you knew how impulsive I am
you would not be surprised at what followed. I happened to be in
a rollicking humour, and ready for any piece of waggery. I had
preserved my incognito. There was not a soul on the course that
knew me. So I thought I would play a little practical joke. Taking
one of these prophets aside I arranged that he should mark the cards
as I directed. Then came my part of the pleasantry. By the merest
chance I happened to have brought on to the course with me a carpet
bag containing a green hat with yellow stars at the front and back,
a bright blue coat with large red buttons, a pair of—perhaps I had
better say—a dado of pink and black stripes, a false nose, a large
porte-monnaie labelled Brown of London," and a board plastered over
with the races arranged on a white card with a deep black margin.
Hastily assuming this disguise I strongly resembled "commis-
sioners " of a reafly respectable character. And now the joke com-
menced. My friend the prophet sent me plenty of customers. I
assisted to put the public "on" the King of Scotland for the Cliftxm-
ville Plate, Grace for the Preston Handicap, Chutney for the Kemp
Town Plate, and Marc Antony for the Welter Handicap. Those
who were present know that none of these " noble quadruped 'orses"
(as'my prophet called them) "was able to win." The King, in spite
of a good thumping from CANNON (rather suggestive of Blackheath
riding on a Sunday) failed to get up to the Judge's Chair at the
finish. Grace's colours (straw and sky-blue sleeves) were prettier
than her performances. ROSSITEB had it all his own way on Ligu-
rian, and as for Marc Antony, he was as much out of the race as
Cleopatra. But now I considered that the joke was growing a little
stale—the more especially as I learned from my customers that the
Prophet had given Cannie Chiel (the horse that subsequently
jame in first) as his selection for the Steward's Cup. I retired during
the running of this race, hastily resumed my ordinary costume, ana
quietly and unostentatiously returned to Brighton. Not a soul
saw me go! In conclusion, I may say that I spent the day, on the
whole, in rational, innocent, and not altogether unprofitable amuse-
ment.
I will merely add, that the remainder of the " Sussex Fortnight"
vas passed at Lewes, and I am hard at work upon the entries
'or the Autumn Handicaps. The Old Stagers have had a good week

A SCARE IN THE CITY.
THE shell has burst over the City. The Commission of Inquiry
into the Livery Companies is London-Gazetted; the styles and titles
of the twelve Commissioners, one for each of the twelve great Com-
panies, are duly set forth, the nature and scope of the investigation
are precisely detailed ; and the name of the Secretary is not suggestive
of peaceful proceedings—it is WABR.
The Companies (eighty or so in number) will invite the Com-
mission to dine with them in rotation. As a preliminary, the
Members are all cramming themselves for examination.
Relays of Charwomen are busy night and day in the Halls,
preparing for the Chairmen.
The Apothecaries have offered to attend the Commissioners for
nothing, on every day after the fare; the Barbers will shave them
on the same liberal terms; the Cooks are ready to submit their
(cookery) -books to the most rigid scrutiny, and show all their receipts
for years; there will always be a knife and fork for them at the
Guttlers'—we mean the Cutlers'; the Fishmongers will offer their
little haul for dinner; and the Fruiterers wfll give them their
desserts.
The Glaziers will appear in their best window-sashes; the Glovers
intend to be hand-in-glove with them; the Girdlers hope to get
round the Commissioners by girdling (we attach the utmost signifi-
cance to this term, none but Freemen of the Company know its
exact import); the Goldsmiths are on their metal; the Gun-Makers
are alarmed lest their pockets should be rifled; the Joiners will join
them at dinner (unless the parish-clerks forbid the banns); the
Merchant Taylors have intrusted their case to a committee of nine,
who will be as one man; and the Musicians will be instrumental
in bringing about a satisfactory finish.

CHAPTER XI.
RETURNING CONSCIOUSNESS.
E. MATTIX put his hand
to his head. His hair
was still curled
tightly. What was
this sudden change?
Where was he? In a
show at a booth. If
ever in his life he had
heen on the verge of
proposing to a woman
it had been within the
last five minutes?
Another second and
he would have popped
the momentous ques-
tion. Was he a canon
or a pop-gun P He
was sane and safe.
Where was his horse P
The sound of ap-
plause greeted his
ears, and above the
din arose the measure
of a tune he had heard
in his earliest infancy
as associated with a
circus. It was " The
Bronze Hone."
Faster and faster it
was played: urged by
the tune, he rushed
from the door, and
crossing a passage
came in sharp contact
with another door,
through a hole in which he saw La Signora cantering round the circus on his own cob, as
she bowed with inimitable grace right and left to the spectators. Ah! what would he not
have given to have ridden with her on the same cob, and an old-fashioned pillion!
And here the author must beg it to be remembered that Mr. MATTIX was not in all
things a bad man. His motives, like his grog at night, were mixed; and though his con-
duct is generally such as I am compelled for the sake of my most respectable readers to
blame severely, yet, I assure you, I cannot prevent him from succumbing to these impulses
which, if nice for the time being, are undoubtedly naughty; though I am willing to admit
that it would have been difficult to impress Mr. MATTIX with the moral truths contained
in one of his own sermons, could it have been read aloud to him on this particular occasion.
Mr. MATTIX had never been an immoral man, and therefore might have a good deal of
amusement yet in store for him, as in early life he had devoted himself so entirely to study
as to have had neither eyes nor thoughts for anything but the strictest mathematical defi-
nitions and the very plainest axioms. It must, therefore, be conceived by my readers, who
would not for one moment tolerate the slightest suspicion of immorality in any of my works
any more than I should myself, that Mr. MATTIX in all this was firmly convinced that, in
making love to two Ladies at once, he was acting from the very highest motives, and that
if he had ultimately married one for her money, and gone off with another for love, he
would stall have pacified his conscience by the reflection that no harm can be done where
none is intended, that least said is soonest mended, and that the happiness of the greatest
number is the object of the individual.
He saw no immorality in having two belles to his one beau, and as he rode back to Small-
Beerjester on the cob which Mr. MKUUYMAN had brought out with La Signora's compliments
and thanks, he hummed to himself "How happy could I be with either" and began
to debate whether such an Italian Marchesa with the family diamonds was not worth two
MORLEBNAS, even with the highest clerical preferment in view. So he returned to Small-
Beerjester, and informed Mrs. Dow DIE of the arrangement he had made to surprise all
Small-Beerjester at her first garden-party, which, "for your sake, my dear Lady," said
Mr. MATTIX warmly, "I hope to see the biggest possible success."
Mr. MATTIX, I must admit, was not exactly honest in this utterance, but after all, he was
placed in a difficult position, and if he had said too much about La Signora, would not my

readers have been deprived of the stirring
recitation of the scene which they are al-
ready enjoying by anticipation, and which
they may safely expect, for I am not one to
raise false hopes and fears, and then baffle
aspirations—in the next Chapter.
How grievous a thing for Miss KITTY
CLOVER it is to have all her interest in a
Novel suddenly destroyed by Miss PAULINA
PHY, who, having peeped into the third
volume and read the last chapter, is able
triumphantly to inform her weeping friend
that she neea not shed tears over the death
of the heroine in the middle of Volume
Two, as she comes to life again as right as
ninepence,andmarries<Str Frederick Phinis,
at the very end of the book. No, my sweet
KITTY CLOVER, although you do bother me
so, oh—oh, oh, oh! and da capo—oh, oh,
oh!—your interest in my novel shall not be
destroyed by any PAULINA PRY, 1 promise
you, for there is no last volume to peep into,
and the finishing chapter of this work shall
be as deep a secret from you as were the
contents of the Blue Chamber to Madame
Fatima, until her husband gave her the key
and she let the Catastrophe out of the bag.
But your own favourite novelist is no Turk
of a Blue Beard, and as he doesn't wish his
dear Miss KITTY CLOVER to lose her head,
he will not trust her with the key, and
when he does open the Blue Chamber Chap-
ter at the end. you may depend upon it you
shall not be shocked at the revelation, and
shall only see—what you shall see; that and
nothing more, or what would my Lady
Patronesses, my dear Spinsters of over forty,
my dear Matrons and Materfamiliases say
to me, were I to show you inside this Blue
Chamber, a row of yellow-covered foreign-
looking books labelled ZOLA, DAUDBT, MON-
TKPIN, BOISOOBERT, and one or two other
names that I could mention, did I wish to
be flouted out of all honest British house-
holds and be excommunicated by MUDIB
& Co.?
No, no, my dear Miss PHY, no, no, my
sweet Miss CLOVKR, and no, no, no, excellent
Mrs. GOODYTWOSHOES, you may try and
make friends with the worthy publisher of
this periodical, and do your best to induce
him to let you into the secrets of the last
chapter, 'but even he will be unable to
gratify your curiosity, and we will go hand
in hand in full and perfect confidence,
author and reader, right up to the finale of
this troubled story.
So, my dear Ladies, on we goes to China,
or rather on we go to the Episcopal Palace
of Small-Beerjester, where, as you are al-
ready numbered among our Mrs. DOWDIE'S
intimate friends, you will be admitted—you
and I together in our Sunday best—and
trust me to take you into the refreshment
room, to point you out what is going on at
different tames between La Signora and Mr.
MATTIX in one corner, or La Signora La
Marchesa di ZAZZEGLIA and the Bishop in
another, and how MORLEENA has her eye
on Mr. ARABLE, who has just arrived, and
how Mr. ARABLE has his eyes on Miss Mou-
LEENA, and how the latter's sister NEVA-
LEENA • is observant of everything and
everybody including the Archbeaoon, who,
with his father-in-law, the worthy Mr.
SIMPLER, is dismissing the prospects of the
Mastership of Deedler's, and the chances
of Sir ISAAC ALLPHEEZE having his bill of
costs discharged in full within the time of
the present Bishop's reign over the See of
Small-Beerjester.
You see we shall have enough to do to-
gether without peeping into volume the
Third, but by merely passing Mrs. DOWDIE'S
footmen and cutting the pages, we shall go
in for the next Chapter.

PERVERSE FACTS AND FIGURES.
ME. PUNCH,
REALLY, Sir, the conductors of newspapers should be very
careful how they promote or permit the publication of figures capable
of being quoted by the enemies of Progress, for their own purpose,
against the Social Reformers now so earnestly endeavouring to en-
force parental legislation for the curtailment of freedom of indulg-
ence in those personal inclinations of which, being offensively opposed
to their own, they desire the repression as, above all things, requisite
for the general good.
In an account of the Bank Holiday at the Alexandra Palace, your
principal contemporary, the other day, related certain "particulars
respecting the demand on the refreshment departments; amongst
them these :—
"There were consumed 720 dozen of spirits, 470 dozen wine, 1600 dozen
bottles of ale, 730 botiles of stout, 9,000 dozen lemonade, ginger-beer, soda-
water, and seltzer-water, 350 barrels of draught ale, 30,000 oupa of tea and
coffee, and 12,600 one-shilling teaa."
The enumeration then goes on to eatables; but what I protest
against is the foregoing statement as to drinkables, in connection
with what follows:—
"The total number of visitors, as already reported, was 107,852. It is very
satisfactory to state that there was not a single instance of disorderly conduct
on the part of the immense concourse."
Satisfactory, indeed! Quite the reverse, Sir. According to the
quantities of intoxicating liquors above given, a very large propor-
tion of their consumers ought to have been drunk and disorderly,
whereas they were no such thing. Moreover, with an option be-
tween intoxicating and non-intoxicating liquors, the holiday people
at the Alexandra Palace ought by no means to have partaken of the
latter in comparison with the former at the foregoing rates, which
represent Personal Option as having, in effect, all the advantage
which we contend can only be derived from Local Option. This is
not the way to speed the crusade against the liquor traffic, and to
demonstrate the necessity for closing restaurants on Sunday.
I have the honour of boasting myself to be, Sir, your humble
Servant, an uncompromising member of the United Kingdom Alliance,
and a zealous out-and-out GOOD TEMPLAR.
P.S.—I trust you will impartially print the preceding protest,
although your name is synonymous with a beverage I wish abolished
by Act of Parliament.

BEESWING.
The sixth great fxhibition of the British Bee-Keepers' Asto-
ciation was held on Tuesday, July 27, at the Royal Horticultural
Gardens, South Kensington.
Earl SPBMCBR has been memorialised in favour of appointing
a Professor of Bee-culture, in connection with the Science and
Art Department, South Kensington.
How doth the little busy Bee
Increase her little power,
And gather favour every day,
And almost every hour!
How pleased she hears within her cell
That Apiculture thrives!
That honeycomb is selling well,
And Bees are having " drives " 1
In Exhibition hive and tent
She would be sharer too,
So swarms to Kensington are sent
Their busy work to do.

"The Bees shall have a Chair,"

And humbly settle there.
Collision and Cause.
Now that the travelling season has commenced, the
chapter of accidents is open, and on its first pa$e we read
that railway collisions are very commonly owing to the
fatal circumstance that some stationmaster, pointsman,
signalman, engineer, guard, or other official has lost his
head. This mischance will sometimes occur on the best
regulated railway, hut it is very commonly owinp to a
system of shortsighted economy, under which a railway
servant gets over-worked, fatigued, and distracted to a
degree which, in respect of head, is virtually equivalent
to decapitation. Talk of danger from loose sleepers, what
sleeper can be more dangerous than a dozing signalman':

MUD-SALAD MARKET.
MCH-SALAD Market belongs to his Grace the Duke of MUDFOBD.
It was once a tranquil Convent Garden, belonging first to the Abbot
of WESTMINSTER, and finally to the Dukes of MUDFORD. The pro-
perty having been let on building leases, it became a small square in
the centre of London, bounded on one side by INIGO JONES'S church,—
"The handsomest barn in England,"—on another side by a theatre,
and warmly supported on other sides by numerous minor taverns.
The hot-houses of the old Garden have become the pot-houses
of the modern Market. Mud-Salad Market, like its own vege-
tables, has now sprouted out in all directions. Tou may start
from Cabbage-leaf Corner, near the site of Temple Bar, on a market-
morning, and may go as far as Turnip-top Square in Bloomsbury, or
Cauliflower-place at Charing Cross, and it is all Mud-Salad Market.
Houses are barricaded with mountainous carts of green-stuff, cabs
lose themselves in vain attempts to drive through the maze of vege-
tables, the oostermonger makes temporary gardens on the pathway,
while the roads are blocked with waggons, carts, donkey-trucks, and
porters staggering under the weight of huge baskets. Carrots, turnips,
vegetable-marrows, potatoes, lettuces, and onions are masters of the
situation. Vegetable refuse, ankle deep, carpets the pathway in
every direction, mixed with mud and rain-water, and trampled into
a pulpy slimy muck by thousands of hob-nailed boots. Leases drop
in, old houses are pulled down, great spaces are cleared, new houses
of an approved stucco type are built, and no attempt is made to
increase the legitimate limits of Mud-Salad Market.
Is any rent paid for the occupation of the public highways? Are
any rates exacted by an obsequious Board of Guardians for the
practical annexation of property belonging to the ratepayers P Is it
not a fact that in dealing with the rateable value of Mud-Salad
Market proper, and the Duke of MUDKOKD'H own theatres (for he
owns two, including a concert-hall), Bumbledom shows every dispo-
sition to make things pleasant for the Dock F Why don't the paro-
chial Guardians make things pleasant for his less distinguished
neighbours? It is not too much to say that Mud-Salad Market is a
disgrace to London, a special disgrace to his Grace of MTTDFORD, and
about the greatest nuisance ever permitted in a great City of
Nuisances.
Bather different this account of Mud-Salad Market from LEIGH
HURT'S description of a certain Coyent Garden Market in his day,
when " it was the most agreeable in the metropolis," and when it
had been "raised" into a convenient and elegant state by the
noble proprietor." Let his Grace of MITDFOBD take a leaf from that
Duke's tree, and, if he can't "raise" Mud-Salad Market, let him
"raze" it, and give us a new one.
Grant, your Grace, a new broom to some one, let a clean sweep be
made of Mud-Salad Market, and your petitioners will never again
pray anything any more.

OUR REPRESENTATIVE MAN.
At Drury Lane, for the Premiere of the World.
EAB MR. rUNCII,
SIR,—Messrs.
PAULMERRITT,
HENRY PET-
IITT, and AU-
GUSTUS HARRIS
have produced,
between them,
a genuine sen-
sational and
aituational
Melodrama. It
is one of those
What-shall-
we-do-next-to-
startle-'emsort
of pieces, which
18 as "safe as
houses," and
"big! houses"
loo. The following synopsis may convey some idea of what* the
I'lay is like :—
Act I. Tableau 1. II. Emden, (I copy the hill. "H. EMDEN"
ia not the name of the Scene, but the Scenic Artist.) Cape Colony.
Steamer at back, about to start. Man at the Wheel, polishing it.
No one speaks to him, of course. Nursemaid (a widow) seated before
him. No one speaks to her. Everybody watches them closely.
Evidently there is a mystery about these twopersona. What is \i 'f
[s the steersman in love with the widow? Won't the widow listen
to the steersman? Does silence speak consent P This is the action
at the back. In front, enter various villains under various aliases,
one being a comic gentleman of the Hebrew persuasion, "charac-
teristically" (this is a safe word in criticism) played by Mr. HAEHT
JACKSON. There is a Mr. Owen—"a diamond seeker"—who I
fancied would have turned out as thorough a villain as the worst
of them if he had been allowed to survive the Second Act. This
is played by Mr. ARTHUR MATHISON. Seeing this gentleman's name,
and recognising in him the talented librettist, songster, and com-
poser—all in one—everybody expected " with a song " in the bills.
But everybody was—disappointed. He only had one chance in
Act II. on board the gallant Something (whatever it was) when it
was quite on the cards for him to have called out, cheerily, "Avast
there, messmates! We 're crossing the Equator; and when we 're
doing that, 'tis a way we have in the Navy to sing a song."
Everybody (on board, of course). Aye! aye! A song! a song 1
And then, of course, Mr. Owen would have at once obliged the
company with a ditty and chorus. After the song, up starts some
other jovial person, and cries, "A dance! a dance 1" But nothing
of this happened. No; they passed over the Equator as if they had
simply overlooked it, and But I find I 've got to the end of
Act II. before I 've done Act I.
Act I. (resumed). The villains tell each other what they know of
one another's villany. They all do it, and are all in it. The comic
guileless Israelite sends dynamite on board the gallant Something, and
induces another villain—one Bashful or Bashford—to go on board.
Sir Clement Huntingford (Sir WILLIAM RIGNOLD), a stout Baronet
under an alias, enters, and becomes very sentimental—all stout
people are-^about the elegant and comparatively thin heroine. Mary
Blythe (Miss F. JOSEPHS). Then the bell rings, and Everybody goes
on board disguised as Somebodies Elses under aliases, including the
Captain. The steamer—licensed to carry at least thirteen passen-
gers, and ultimately intended to ply between Chelsea and London
Bridge Piers—starts. Yet not one word has passed between the
above-mentioned Man at the Wheel, and the Maid in a widow's cap!
What is this mystery?
Act //.—On board; where Mr. MATHISON doesn't sing, where they
don't dance, and where Pop goes the Dynamite, and down comes the
Curtain. Where's Mr. PLIMSOLL? This boat, licensed to carry
thirteen, is taking five times the number. Is it an expanding boat?
Is it blown out before being blown up? Impossible to say. But in
this Act at least sixty persons come to an untimely end, and all
friends in front would have been inconsolable for so great a loss
had they not subsequently recognised nearly all the passengers alive
and well in the Third Act, promenading about the Aquarium in
the identical dresses they had worn on that fatal day aboard that
ill-starred vessel.
Act II.—Death of Owen (Mr. ABTHUR MATHISON)—morte d'A rthur
—without a song. A struggle for the last drop. 'Tis lost; and as a
ship heaves in sight, down cornea another drop—the Act Drop.
Act ///.—The Royal Aquarium filled with survivors from the
gallant Something, as specimens of sea-water preservation. Mr.
AUGUSTUS HARRIS appears in evening dress, as another villain, with
the elegant heroine. Comic Hebrew reappears, and with him a new
villain, who is an old villaim-^-one Lumley, a Solicitor (Mr. J. R. GXB-
SON)—the best-played part in the whole piece. There is quite a
surfeit of villains in this piece. The Man at the Wheel and the
Maid in widow's weeds have disappeared for ever, having been, ap-
parently, the only victims of the dynamite explosion. Perhaps their
story is to be continued in Messrs. MERRITT, PETTITT, and HARRIS'S
next. What a lot of double letters in these three names!
Tableau 5.—Interior of a Great Hotel. Stout Baronet, under an
alias, chloroformed by Bashful under another alias, who, in turn,
is killed by Mr. AUGUSTUS HABBIS, the Stout Baronet's Wicked
Brother in disguise. Thrilling.
Act IV.—After the Hotel a scene in an Inn—Lincoln's Inn. Two
mad Doctors—both mad— join a Solicitor, the Wicked Brother, and
a few others in committing stout but sentimental Baronet to a private
Lunatic Asylum.
Tableau 7.—Good Scene by H. CUTHBERT.—Stout Baronet knocks
down ten keepers, escapes from the Asylum, then hires a punt
by the hour, and probably ends the day stickleback-fishing in his
shirt-sleeves, with a jug of beer and a long pipe.
Act V.—Palace Chambers. Really palatial. I think it is in this
scene that Mr. HARRIS exclaims, in a cruelly rasping voice, " It's a
lie I" whereupon Miss HELEN BARRY asks him "if he doubts her
y«racity?" She looked as if she could have eaten him, so he thought
it best not to express any further doubts as to her " voracity." Comic
Hebrew and old villain taken by police; and Wicked Brother of stout
sentimental Baronet, rushing after Elegant Heroine, declaring wildly,
"I love yer to substraction"—like Captain Croistree—receives a
"wunner" from the elegant one, which knocks him down the place
where the lift ought to be. Having thus given the piece a lift where
it might have fallen a little flat, as the Wicked Brother must have
been after the descent of the ascenseur—off we go to
Tableau 9.—A Fancy Ball, where the stout sentimental Baronet
comes, with the Elegant Heroine, to celebrate the event of his Wicked
Brother's recent death, and to convey the melancholy intelligence to
Mrs. Wicked Brother (Miss HELEN BABRY), who, but for that, would
have made a night of it.
That's all. Moral.—Don't be a stout sentimental Baronet
Can I doubt its success? No, not for The World, says
YOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
P.8. No. 1.—At one time there was some danger of too much
attention being paid to upholstery 9n the Stage, but Mrs. BATE-
MAN feels certain that she can't furnish her house better than with
genuine old Chippendale.

A MERCANTILE TORPEDO.
ON Saturday last, a daring seaman, "Captain GBAY.of the barque
Letterewe" of whose head, if possible, a oast should be taken, be-
cause, according to Phrenology, it ought to exhibit a hole instead of
a prominence at the "organ of Caution," was convicted by the
Liverpool Bench on a charge of having on board his vessel paraffin
instead of vegetable oil; therewith non-safety matches; and there-
withal the cargo below specified:—
"The vessel was lying in the river with thirty-fire tons of gunpowder on
board, and the police found two paraffin lamps burning in the cabin."
The reporter of these particulars premises them with the remark
that "some heavy penalties " were imposed by the Liverpool Justices
on Captain GBAY, and concludes them with the statement that—
"The defendant was fined £10 and coats for the first offence, and £5 and
costs for the other."
Suppose, instead of thirty-five tons of gunpowder the Letlereuie
had contained as many pounds of contraband tobacco. In that case
would Captain GRAY have escaped with only £15 and costs to pay?
If so, he would have been let off with penalties very light compara-
tively to those which contraband tobacco renders its possessor liable
to, and which are usually inflicted. What a difference in heinous-
ness, as well as in danger, between the concealment of contraband
tobacco and the unlawful storage of gunpowder!

(From the Hysterical London News.)
Mr esteemed colleague of the Smokely-on-Sewer Observer is entirely in
error in stating that OLIVER CROMWELL ever wore spectacles, and that, from
those aids to vision being tri-lateral and of an azure hue, he was known among
his Presbyterian Soldiery, now as " True Blue," andnowas " Goggles." Nothing
•whatever of the kind. I knew " Old Noll" very well; that is to say, I remember
my grandmother telling me that she could remember a Punch and Judy man
who had once been in possession of the skull of the illustrious Protector (whom
SHENSTONE justly calls " the Greatest Prince who ever reigned in England "),
and that, from the appearance of the superciliary ridge, the external and
internal orbitary prominences, and the nasal frontal suture, he was certain that
CHOSTWF.LL never wore spectacles.
I wonder whether the bantering expression, "Nolle prosequi," (used when
you decline to go any further with a wearisome companion) refers in any way
to CROMWELL having been exceptionally active in the prosecution of CHARLES
THE FIKST. And, touching etymons, it might be as well to consult JUNIUS,
SKINNER, WORCESTER, WALKER, WEBSTER (0, rare BEN WEBSTER !), MENAGE,
PHILLIPS, WEDGWOOD, and Professor SKEAT as to whether there be any
foundation for the popular belief that "Old Noll" should properly be spelt
"Knoll," the word having a sly reference to
the victor of Naseby.

Mem.—There are to my knowledge (I had almost said " Nol "-ledge) eleven
beads of Old Noll extant: one at Knole Park; another in the Hoodlum Museum,
Kearney Street, San Francisco; a third at Chandernagore: a fourth belonging
io the Time-Keeper of the Straits of Malacca; a fifth in the Bodleian Library
!this is from the Collection of old NOLLEKENS the Sculptor); a sixth at Madame
TUSSACB'S (only .the proprietors are not aware of the fact, and exhibit the
skull as that of HENRI QUATRE); a seventh in the Kiatigorod Museum at
Moscow; an eighth in the Balearic Isles (it is that of OLIVER when he was at
school) ; a ninth in the SULTAN'S private cabinet of ca'imcs, coupons, and crania
at Constantinople; a tenth in the Trippenhuis Gallery at Amsterdam; and the
eleventh in the possession of your humble servant. Not any are genuine
except mine.
A fair Correspondent writes me that through tb
munificence of Sir JOHN TENPF.NNT NATLOB, Bart., M.P..
the charming little town of East Grinnington has been
endowed with a Free Library, of which a special section
has been apportioned to Lady readers; and, as a member
of the Library Committee she asks me for a succinct Iis1
of useful and entertaining works suitable for "general
reading," say of girl students, between the ages of nine
and nineteen. I nave the greatest pleasure in complying
with her request. Here is the list:—
HIOOISS'S Anacalypsis; HOU.NE TOOKE'S Diversions o,
Parley; BOPPSIUS On Tetrahedral f)ecadendra; QUACK.BN-
EOSCH On the Equivocal Quincunx; Sir 11. PHTLLIPS'S Essays
on the Proximate Mechanical Causes of tJie General Phenomena
of the Universe; SPINOSA On Diseases of the Spine; ALBBRTUV

of Ole Bull, The Zendavesta; DR. BUTTERFIELD'S Memoirs of

a Novel, by Miss LOUISA LAWN TENNISON; JORNOVIUS'S
Theory of the Spheroid Bulb ; JEtECAMPADius's Greek Roots,
The fatty Koran; BACON'S Minor Essays, comprising " Basher
Thoughts," "UptheEind,"andthe" Perfect Cure; " MOULDY-
MUGG'S Thoughts on Suicide and Meditations on Homaopathy;
the Belle's Assemblee for the year 1813; GRINDERANI'S Organic
Remains; and HUFF'S Guide to the Turf.
I shall be happy to reply either in this column or
directly to my correspondent "OOGIPOFF," if he wil]
favour me with some more definite address than " Bed-
ford Level, Vale of White Horse;" but I must respect-
fully request that neither he, nor the Gentleman from
Hanwell (who bit my parlour-maid in the arm last
Wednesday), nor the Lady who claims to be the Rightful
Heir to "England's Thorny Throne" (see her thirty-
seventh letter to me), will in future repair to my private
residence at seven A.M. for the purpose of throwing
mud, eggs, gingerbeer bottles, and other missiles at my
dining-room windows, because I have been unable to
discover whether it was GEORGE SELWYN, MACHIAVELLI,
or the Arabian physician AVICENNA, who made use of
the remarkable expression, "That accounts for the milk
in the cocoa-nut; but not for the hair outside."
I have often thought that remark anent the milk in
the cocoa-nut worthy to make a sixth with the famous
Five Aphorisms of HIPPOCRATES. I wonder whether I
could repeat them, now, without book. I remember,
more than seven-and-forty years ago, learning them
(the aphorisms, not the years) at my good old Nurse
MUFFIN'S knee. Let me see—

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

MOKDAY, August 9th (Lords}.—In reply to Lord STANLEY OF
ALDKKLKY, who wanted to know whether the Government intended to
take part in a Naval Demonstration against the Turks, Lord GRATT-
VILI.K intimated that premature fist-shaking was not at all in his
line; but that without attempting a political pas seul, as European
Policemen, the Government meant, if needful, to play its proper
part in Concerted Coercion.
The Earl of DUNRAVEN thought that the best way to help Ireland
wag to assist Irishmen to get out of it, in the way of emigration.
Lord KIMBBRLET, while admitting that there might be some local
congestion of population, which could be treated by depletion, con-
sidered that the chief duty of Government was to enable Irishmen to
stop at home, and be happy.
(Common*.)—Lord HABTINGTOW declared, that notwithstanding
ATOOB KnAW. and Mr. ASHMEAD BAKTLRTT, the Government in-
tended to withdraw all our forces from Cabul as soon as possible.
Neither temporary reverses in Afghanistan nor persistent Bogey-
mongering in St. Stephen's, would turn the Government from its
settled policy.

Regret to keep all in for the bad few,
But there 's a lot of work that you must do.

About—let's see—well, anyhow, some day!
Tableau!!
In Committee of Supply the House listened to Mr. STOUT-MASK E-
LYNE'S stories, and the tales of (UKKKSFOHII) HOPE, concerning the
British Museum, and the Minor Apostles of Economy had each his
peculiar (and unavailing) peck at various votes. Officialdom's love
of economy is a fine illustration of what the Scotch girl called " love
ia the aibstract." But when Mr. TEUTELSDBOCH THOMPSON pro-
posed to do away with judges' marshals and javelin-men, and
Iconoclastic Mr. WATKIN WILLIAMS spoke of the time-honoured
legal paraphernalia of wigs and gowns, &o., as "old-fashioned rub-
bish, it was felt that'' the man who would speak disrespectfully of
the Equator" had at last been surpassed.
Tuesday (Lords}.—Lord DOKCHKSTEK asking inopportune ques-
tions about Brigadier-General BUKBOWS " brought down the House"
in wrath upon his devoted head, and had to retire up" under a
pelting shower of "unfair, unjust, ungenerous," and the like little
amenities.
Ah me! these phlogistical times! e'en the calm brow of wisdom wean
furrows,
With rows in the Commons on Rabbits, and shines in the Lords about
BURROWS.
(Commons.)—Sir W. PALLISER opined that the Sherpur Camp
ought not to have been abandoned before the result of General
ROBERTA'S expedition was known. The Government did not agree
with him.
Then uprose CHAPLIN in his wrath (as easily turned on at the
main as the Mulberry One's tears), and assuming (as Lord IIAKT-
INOTON remarked) the Leadership of the Opposition, asked the
Government what the dickens they meant by putting the House iu
the "peculiar" position of being hard at it in the middle of August?
Lord HurnsiJTON retorted that the "peculiar position" had been
caused by factious motions, irrelevant questions, and the general
indiscipline of what Mr. BEBBSFOBD HOPE called "Her Majesty's
Illegitimate Opposition," whether the proceedings of that party are
more characterised by plaguiness or puerility Mr. Punch finds it
hard to determine.
Then bland LABOUCHBRB, in the Bill called " the Hares and the Kabbits"
Would include other game which had equally horrible habits.
For pheasants, put out in the park with their cooped foster-mothers.
Old Gooseberry played with the barley-crops, wheat-crops, and others.
The mild mangold-wurzel and innocent swede would then follow,
Cart-loads of the former they riddled and left them all hollow.
Since Game 's " common property "—(Qroani)—he 'd instruct the Committee
To extend this small Bill s small provisions without the least pity.
"Heah! heah!" P. A. TAYLOR broke in, "though the Bill u so little,
/will not oppose if you don't too much pare, trim, and whittle."
Says HARCOURT, " The Bill's to save crops, 'tis not meant to spoil sport."
Cnes CHAPLIN, "That LABOUCHBRB ought to be laughed out of Court
For muddling up deer with winged game; and, serene as he looked,
If he tried a day's grouse-driving he would be pretty well' cooked.'"
"It's all nasty envy," sneers ELCHO. Amendment snuffed out.
Then HICKS on poached eggs, and renewal of row and of rout.
"Confiscation," cries CHAPLIN, "should be this bad Cabinet'i nomen"
Which brought up JOHN BRIGHT to the rescue, that dourent of foemeu.
"In the name of the Prophet—eggs! eggs!" cried J. I)., " 'tis atrocioui!"
"Go to!" cries Sir STAFFORD, " 0 Quaker extremely ferocious;

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
You 'd pose at the Friend of the Farmer—that'» your little game!"
And—so on—boy-snagging repeated—and more of the same,
Till after eleven long hours of such hullaballoo,
The House, tired and angry, adjourned at ten minutes to tiro.
Wednesday [Commons).—Eris again in the ascendant. Erin's
champions entirely outdone by their English imitators, Lord E.
CECIL, Mr. R. YORKE, Earl PERCY, the clamorously contentious
CHAPLIN, and the exuberantly egotistic ELCHO—that querulous
quintelt of lovers of the imperative mood (and of the first person
singular) playing such fantastic tricks before the SPEAKER as made
Mr. Punch heartily ashamed of them. In the brief intervals of
such intermittent shower of sputtering imbecilities, some small pro-
gress was made with the Hares and Rabbits Bill, the discussion
thereanent being for the most part as much like "debate," in the
old worthy sense, as Donnybrook to Roncesvalles. Eris, did Mr.
Punch say? Nay, the ruling spirit of this Parliamentary Tohu-
bohu must hail from the fish-market, not the three-forked hill.
"Popguns and boys, I sing, whom cynic fate
And Landlordism's unrelenting hate,
Gave pigmy sport upon St. Stephen's floor,
Where the clean steel of heroes clashed before,"—
should he the exordium of the new Parliamentary Epos.
Mr Punch, like Sir W. HAKCOTTIIT, is sorry that in their "stand-
and-deliver" kind of interrogation, the Angry Boys of Westminster
have found "a new instrument of Obstruction." A pity that, like
contraband Catapults, and surreptitious Squirts, all the instruments
of these puerile plagues of Parliament cannot be incontinently con-
fiscated. Meanwhile Jovian jobations from JOHN BHIOHT, and
caustic repartees from Sir WILLIAM HABCOURT, seem to have little
more effect than grape-shot on gnat-swarms upon this Revolt of the
Midges.
Lord HARTINGTON'S calm and resolute conduct of business under
such irritating difficulties Mr. Punch doth much commend.
Thursday (Lords).—Three hours' discursive and dry-as-dust chat
on recalcitrant Reporters, Affairs in Afghanistan, and the British
Army. How distil essence from broad-blown chaff?
(Commons.)—In reply to Mr. OTWAY, Sir C. DIIKE intimated that
the question of giving an assurance to Turkey against further carving
in the future, provided she consents to the slicing recommended at
present, had been mooted. The promise had not been made; but
"in principle" the Government did not object to it. Punch opines
that this "principle " may bear fruit anon.
Then something notable at last. After much debate, not, of
course, novel in argument, but also not ignoble in tone, the Burials
Bill (down from the Lords with amendment, which will have to be
amended) was read a Second Time by a majority of 179 (258 against
79). Mr. Punch congratulates Mr. 0. MORGAN, the House, the
Country, and the Church, on what looks like the beginning of the
end of an embittered contest of twenty years about—shadows.
BEKESFORD HOPE was comically ruefully pessimistic; JOHN BRIGHT
pleadingly pathetically optimist, the latter remarking that when
brought fairly face to face with the phantom Terror they had them-
selves conjured up, the opponents of Salutary Change generally
"went to perdition " with a light heart and a cheerful countenance.
Mr. Punch confidently predicts that in this, as in hundreds of
Erevious "Rushes upon Ruin," the hosts of spectral fears and
obgoblin forebodings will be found to have been but the dimly
dreadful unrealities of funk-ridden fancy.
Friday (Lords).—Piteous plaint from poor Lord REDESDALE :—
Late, late, so late! so little work to do,
Yet bound to wait that wrangling Commons' orew.
Bo late, so late! Why not employ us now!
Late, late! so late the measures come to us,
Small time is there those measures to discuss.
So late, so late! Oh, let us labour now!
Do we not know the grouse are on the moors?
Waiting for Bills is beastliest of bores.
So late, so late! Give us the straight tip note!
Lord GRANVILLE, whilst warmly commiserating, could administer
but cold comfort.
(Commons.)—The Employers' Liability Bill at last got through
Committee. Imminent solace for plaintive personages "in another
place" who can take their turn at it next week.
Some serious talk on a serious subject—the present condition of
the fever-stricken districts in the west of Ireland, ended in a
Resolution to the effect that the matter demanded the serious and
immediate attention of Her Majesty's Government, a Resolution
readily agreed to by Mr. FOKSTEK, and earnestly emphasised by
Mr. Punch :—
"Then, some having toiled, like the typical Nigger, whilst others obstructed
and fooled, like the Turk;
So ended one more week of purposeless worry, and puerile wrangling, and—
precious hard work!

Seasonable Suggestion.
IN the Deal Chronicle's account of the trial of the Sandwich
Election Petition the following accidental misprint occurs :—
"Messrs. LUSH and MANISTY, Mr. ex-Justice MELLOK occupied a seat
upon the beach, as well as the Mayor, Dr. JOHN 1-1 ILI.IEK, and T. L. BUR-
, Town-Clerk of Sandwich."
"A seat upon the beach," of course at this time of year would be
far preferable to " a seat on the bench ;" and the compositor's idea
of an open-air Court is delightful, but, unfortunately, impracticable.

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
H, the most contemp-
shus fellers as I
knows of is them
as cams and eats
like a Alderman
and drinks like a
tish, and nothing
to pay, and then,
wen they cums
fur their 'ats,
puts a shillin' in
the plate, and
takes out six-
pence change!

wants change. I

wen he give the
woman a whole
soy. for a play
Bill, and refused
change. Ah! he
was summut like a Dook, he was. I should like to meet the likes of
him about wunoe a weak.

A werry hinteresting insedent ocured the other night.
I was assisting at a grand Banket of the Washupfool Company of
Grosers, and a wery nice Liberal set them Grosers is. They almost
all gives me a shilling instead of sixpence, and that's how I judges
of Mankind. Well, Mr. KOOP the grate Brner had to return thanks
for the Howse of Commons, and wen he begun, he looked, as it were,
full to the bung, and didn't he froth away, like his own bottled
Stout, agin that Mr. GLADSTUN and all his set, and didn't he estonish
the Big Wigs, speshally our very big Wig, the Lord Cheif Justus,
who quietly got up and went away, leaving a glassful of the fine old
Madeery, which I instantly removed, for fear it might be spilt, and
put away, and very fine it were, sum of the best I ever tasted. Wot
could have made him go away, afore he had finished his Pyne Apel
too P As BROWN said to me, praps it was the eat or praps it^ were
the drink he didn't like, or praps he didn't like so much of KOOP'S
bitter. Howsumdeyer it quite spiled the hole evening, and many on
'em went away talking so wiolently that they quite forgot to pay for
their Hats. I hates to see a Gent much hegsited, it does make him
so forgetful of the Waiter.
I cannot for the life of me make out wot's in the wind. All the
grate Citty Companees, I think they calls 'em the grate Gills, seems
quite out of sperrits. They eats and they drinks much as usual,
praps more; but they don't have so much fun as formerly. They 're
allus talkin about Spoilthenation and Codfishcation. I don't at all
no what they means, but BROWN says they 're a goin to be axed a lot
of horquad questions about wot they does with their ,monney. I
could tell wot they does with a lot of it, and quite rite too. Wot's
better than Horsepitallerty? as I heard a Rite Reverend Bishup ask
only last weak, and 1 could hardly help gayin, here! here! As I
didn't dare do that, I showed my preshiation in my own way by
instantly fillin him up a bumper of the fine old Madiery, well knowin
if he didn't drink it, sumbody else would.
I sumtimes sees rum things dun. For instance now, only last
week I see quite a grand looking Swell slyly put 2 very fine Peeches
in his coat pocket, so I took care, wen his attenshun was occipied, to
give 'em such a jolly squeege, as must have rather estonished him
wen he got home, and tried to take 'em out. Peech-jam can't be
nice in your best coat pocket.

SENTIMENT V. SPORT.
A MEETING of some consistent Members of the Anti-Vivisection
Society was held the other day at their head-quarters, to consider
about petitioning the Legislature against the Hares and Rabbits
Bill, on the ground that it sanctioned the shooting of live animals,
•which often involved the infliction of much pain upon them.
The Chair was occupied by Sir SIMON SHEEPSHANKS, who, moving
a Resolution in accordance with the object of the Meeting, declared
himself a Vegetarian, and, as such, entirely opposed to the destruc-
tion of living animals, even for the table, which, he contended, the
greengrocer and baker could quite adequately supply without the
butcher.
Mr. BEAPHY was sorry to say he did not quite see that; though he
would have all animals that were killed for the use of being eaten,
slain under chloroform or nitrons oxide, at least if it was quite certain
that the anaesthetic would not injure the meat. If rabbits and hares
were allowed to increase and multiply ad inflnitum, they would soon
destroy all the crops; and where would the Vegetarians be then?
(Murmurs, and cries of "Oh! oh!" and "Turn him out.'")
However, he had really much pleasure in seconding the Resolution
as against hare and rabbit shooting—which having been carried—
Mr. SNODGRASS said that, like the Chairman, he was a votary of
Vegetarianism, therefore he objected to the slaughter of any game
of any description, whether winged or ground. Accordingly, he
would move a Resolution to the effect that grouse, partridges, and
pheasants, also quails, snipe, and woodcock should be inserted in the
Schedule of the Wild Birds Protection Act.
Mr. WAGGLES would gladly second that Motion, notwithstanding
that it undeniably tended in favour of Game Preserving. For afl
that, he would propose to entrust it to the care of Mr. P. A. TATLOK,
who. he doubted not, would readily advocate it in Parliament any
Wednesday.
The Resolutions having both of them been carried with few dis-
sentients, the constituents of the Meeting went about their business.

THE Messrs. GATTI are fortunate in securing the services of
Miss OERIDGE. She is a rich and rare specimen of the young and
pretty contralto. When she sang " Meet Me by Moonlight Alone!"
there was a rush of everybody to the front of the Ambulauditoriuin.
The men cheered to the echo. I don't think the Ladies were quite
so enthusiastic. Miss OBRIDQB can evidently draw as well as sing.
This is an Orridge-inal remark. Mr. COWEN keeps his first-rate
band in excellent order. Time was made for slaves, and he makes it
for them—ruling over them with a rod of iron—by which I mean his
baton. No wonder that they are so submissive and yet so deeply
attached to him, as he is never bullying, though he is always cowin'
them.
The other evening was performed Mr. WALTER AUSTIN'S Camp.
Camp is an Overture, so don't run the final "s" on to the initial
"o" and make it "Scamp,"—the Orchestra didn't do this to it by
any means, but played it in first-rate style. The Camp was pro-
perly pitched, and on his doing his best everybody was in-tent. The
Composer bowed from his private box in reply to a nod from a friend
in the Ambulauditorium.

CHAPTER XII.
MRS. DOWDIE'S GABDEN PABTY.
UK guests came in
shoals.
"It reminds me,
my Lord," said a
witty Minor Canon to
the Bishop, "of All
Shoals' College."
And the Minor
Canon went off with
the roar of a Wool-
wich Infant.
The Bishop, ready
for tennis or croquet,
was in his lawn-
sleeves, racket in
hand. He was all
smiles and bows,
while Mrs. DOWDIE,
in velvet and lace,
was the personifica-
tion of dignified con-
descension. Every-
thing was being
managed admirably;
Mr. MATTIX was here,
there, and every-
where. The Bishop,
however, never en-
tirely lost sight of his
Domestic Chaplain,
who had been entrusted with the key of the wine-cellar, and knew where a
bottle of the best champagne was to be found when it might be wanted for a
person of real appreciation.
Mr. FISHY, the Lawyer of Small-Beerjester, and his wife, were here. Mr.
FISHY had broken with JOHN BOUNCE since the latter's discomfiture, and had
attached himself to the Conservative party in Small-Beerjester. There were
also Messrs. SCALEY and DRAWEE, the Dentists; Mr. SIMONY SIMPLEB and his
daughter MORLEENA: Archbeacon OVERWAYTE and Mrs. OVERWAYTE, with their
friend Mr. ARABLE of Bacon College. Oxford; Miss TINFOIL and her aunt Mrs.
TAWDREY; Mr. GUBOOYLE, the celebrated Architect, from London; the Rev.
BENJAMIN BUTTRESS and Mrs. BUTTRESS, and the Misses BUTTRESS (2): Mr.
LECTEBN Curate of St. All fudge, the Highest Church in the diocese, which had
lately been taken down an inch or two in consequence of some threatened danger
to the fabric; and with him were the Rev. BRASSCO ROWNEB, his Rector, and
his sub-Curates Mr. STOLE and Mr. COPE. There was Sir EXETEB HALL, the
great Evangelical Banker and large Landowner near Small-Beerjester, with his
son ALBERT HALL, overgrown and empty. Prebendary HASSOCK, very red and
very round, was sitting on the grass at the feet of Dean BOOSEY, who, with
a glass of the Bishop's best port in his hand, was giving, as a sentiment,
"Here's confusion to all canting, except de-canting I"
Mrs. HASSOCK and the three Miss HASSOCKS were stuffing themselves in the
dining-room, where old Mrs. BOOSEY was taking her afternoon tea, into which
the Bishop's butler had poured a little cognac by mistake, and being unable to
take it out again, had left it there.
So the rooms and the gardens became full, and everyone paid'his respects to
my Lord, and did suit and service to Mrs. DOWDIE, who moved about with well-
regulated grace, more than content with her success, serenely happy in the
anticipation of a complete triumph, which Mrs. OVEEWAYTE might envy, but
could neither prevent nor equal.
The Bishop, who had received from Mr. MATTLX sufficient information about
the Marchesa to excite his curiosity, was so pro-occupied with the idea that he
could hardly keep his gaiters on, so frequently did he unbutton and button
them up again all wrong in his increasing excitement.
He hadn't been to a theatre for years, and had not had an interview with a
figurante or a coryphee since he had given np all notion of a career in West-

minster.Hall, and had taken the first steps, which he had
been taught by Mrs. DOWDIE, towards his present posi-
tion. Yet he remembered the time when DICK DOWDIE
was not an entire stranger to the coulisses, and when
little three-cornered pink notes used to be sent under
cover of bouquets, and when a week's allowance went in
a night's supper alfresco at the Royal Cremorna Gardens,
or an uncle s aid had to be invoked to supply a little
dinner at the "Star and Garter" on a tine Sunday
evening in July. For one second the good Bishop,
carried back in his imagination to forty years ago, sud-
denly spread out his apron with both hands, and,
humming the inspiring Spanish dance from Le Domino
Noir, executed a characteristic pas. Well for him was
it that Mrs. DOWDIE was at that moment engaged in a
discourse with Mrs. Prebendary WHEEZEH in a distant
room, or he would have received such a rebuke as would
have sent signoras and ballet-dancers out of his head
for some considerable time.
"I feel quite a boy again," said the Bishop to himself
as he paused for breath, and looked round to see if he
had been observed. Then he added, impatiently, "Why
the deuce doesn't she come?"
At last, to the braying of 'trumpets, the clashing of
cymbals, the booming of a big drum, and the crashing
of, an Indian gong, a superbly painted carriage, pre-
ceded by outriders, and drawn by four piebald horses
ridden by postilions in glazed hats, red and blue ribands,
and carrying long cracking whips, dashed up to the hall-
steps. A perfect commotion took place. The Bishop was
in a nervous flutter of excitement, and Mr. MATTIX,
giving him, as he passed, a nudge in the ribs, whispered,
,It 's the Signora!" hurried into the hall to proffer his
assistance, fie was, however, nearly knocked down right
over the big drum, and had his head almost jammed into
a pulp by the cymbals as he encountered the cortege
in the hall. SCARAMOUCH at once put his hand on his
heart, and, bowing low to the Bishop, observed, a pro-
pos of things generally, that "on his honour it wasn't
me," and then with a broad grin he suddenly put his
arms a-kimbo, straddled his legs, waggled his head, and
crying " Here we are again 1 "picked up Mr. MATTIX by
his waistband, then hit Signer PANTALEONE a backhander
in the eye, which sent him into the refreshment-room,
when the reappearance of the Blue Boy with La Marchesa
di ZAZZEGLIA on his arm soon restored what threatened
to be a chaos into the most perfect order.
"I am so proud and happy to meet you, Bishop," said
the Marchesa, in a musical whisper, as she joined her
hands above her head and then whirled round him in
a graceful measure, while Dr. DOWDIE, inspired by old
memories, threw himself on one knee, and playfully fol-
lowed the steps of her twinkling feet, as he used his
shovel-hat for a tambourine, first tightening the strings
so as to get some sort of sound out of it.
There was no one in the hall except a few of the digni-
fied SmallBeerjester Clergy, who, hungrily expecting
preferment, felt it incumbent on them to applaud every
step their Bishop took to the very echo, and they were
just calling loudly for the fandango when a terrible voice,
proceeding from the dining-room door, exclaimed,
"Bishop!"
It was Mrs. DOWDIE. The effect was electric. Not
with contented eyes had Mrs. DOWDIE watched the
arrival of this strange party, and Mr. MATJIX'S enthu-
siastic reception of this intriguing, dancing, bedizened
Italian woman, whatever she might be. Compelled to
absent herself for a few moments, in order to superintend
the erection of the tent for the talented troupe, Mrs.
DOWDIE had not witnessed the entire performance in the
hall. Had she done so, I doubt whether one strip of lace
would have remained on La Marchesa's back, or if one
single bracelet would have been allowed to adorn the
fair foreigner's well-rounded arm.

THE DUKE OP MUDFORD IN GLOOMSBUEY.
THE Duke of MUDFORD'S grip upon London extends far beyond
Mud-Salad Market. As Lord CUL-DE-SAC and the Earl of No
THOROUGHFARE, he claims and exercises a right of blockade _ in
Gloomsbury. London is a very peculiar city. It is said to be six-
teen miles long and eight miles broad, and is supposed to contain a
population of four millions. Its parochial rulers for the last ten
years have devoted all their energy to the improvement of the great
avenues of communication from East to West, but the cross avenues
are in much the same condition as they were in the days of Dr.
JOHNSON. The Strand and Fleet Street have been improved, Oxford
Street, Holborn, Newgate Street, &o., have been widened, a noble
Embankment has been made, and a great serpentine roadway, ex-
tending from Waterloo Bridge to Whitechapel, is in course of
formation. While this is done, or being done, there is not a tho-
roughfare worthy of the name from South to North, from Park Lane
to Chancery Lane. Berkeley Street, Bond Street, St. Martin's Lane,
and other cross streets have to get rid of their northern traffic by
dodging round corners. The most central and most important tho-
roughfare from South to North, is composed of Waterloo Bridge (a
bridge from which the halfpenny tax on suicide has just been re-
moved), Wellington Street (which stands on a hill, and is adorned
by the Thalia and Melpomene Theatres), Bow Street (which might be
called Bow-legged Street, where criminals are tried), Endell Street
(where they grow the criminals who are tried at Bow Street), and
Gower Street, which belongs to the Duke of MUDFORD.
At the north end of Gower Street the traffic is stopped by a ducal
barrier, and turned round several narrow streets, to find its way to
the Huston Road as best it can. Three of the largest railway termini
—the North-Western, the Midland, and the Great Northern—lie in
this direction; but the Duke of MUDFORD, LORD CUL-DK-SAC, and
Earl of No THOROUGHFARE claims his right to stand between these
railways and their floods of traffic. The line must be drawn some-
where, and it is drawn at Gower Street. It was Mrs. PARTTNGTON'S
mission to try to mop back the Atlantic: it is the Duke of MUDFORD'S
mission to push back four millions of people.
By the way, Mud-Salad Market was at its dirtiest and filthiest
last Thursday. Such a standing nuisance in London ought to be as
impossible as it is impassable.
Potation and Quotation.
TOWARDS the finish of a civic dinner, a Deputy, while engaged in
a serious discussion with a Common Councilman on the vice of glut-
tony, became as mixed as his liquors had been. He insisted that
DIVES must have been an Alderman, beeause he was given to " turtle
and fine linen, and fared sumptuously." "Sumpshously" was a
difficult word for the Deputy, but the Common Councilman admitted
the correctness of the quotation, and was convinced.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
(The Colonel on Kempton Park Characteristics.)
HEBE "Kempton Park"
was 111 ml not the vaguest
notion. I had certainly
seen a "Correct Card of
the Races," but this had
not given me much in-
formation. The docu-
ment had been headed
with a medallion sketch
of two weird - looking
persons riding two equal-
ly weird-looking horses,
and bearing altogether a
strong resemblance to
Faust and Hfephistophetes
"making a (Walpurgis)
night of it." But as the
legend round the picture
was "For Sport and Re-
creation," I could not
help believing that the
spot had nothing what-
ever to do with GOETHE
and Germany. Feeling
puzzled, I consulted one
of my friends (who prides
himself upon extreme ac-
curacy) upon the subject,
and was told that Kempton Park was close to either Kensington, Surbiton, or Enneld. He
added that he was not quite sure which, but he " knew it was somewhere there."
Finding, consequently, that the place was within easy reach of town, I luckily remembered
that another friend of mine (at present travelling in Africa in search of lions) had offered me,
just at the break-up of a jovial Greenwich dinner, the mount of a couple of the best of his
hunters whenever I liked to use them. Accordingly, after securing for a moderate sum a
good roomy omnibus, and ordering my friend's groom to put the animals into it, I found
myself possessed of a truly recherche equipage. My only regret was the impossibility of
communicating with the owner in Africa as to the advisability of driving his hunters in


perfectly successful, as the horses by the end of the day were broken in completely. When
my friend returns from Africa (where I sincerely hope that both he and the lions are enjoying
themselves thoroughly), I am sure he will be pleased with the new accomplishment acquired
by his intelligent quadrupeds under my careful tuition.
Probably influenced by the diabolical appearance of the medallion on the Race-Card, I had
pictured the meeting as a weird revel of the wildest character. I had expected to see
Roughs maddened with drink, perambulating Ethiopian Serenaders almost speechless with
the fierce excitement of the "Outer Ring," and—in fact—the rest of it. Nothing could have
been more different. I know it is but a foolish fancy, hut I cannot help thinking that
Kempton Park, in pre-Reformation times, must have been tenanted by some strict monastic
order of the most asoetical character, allowing themselves but one recreation—a little steeple-
chasing. The lovely spot has evidently retained most of its pristine serenity. When I
arrived, I found that the combined influence of gate-money and a certain solemn oalm had
affected every person present. There was an air of sweet resignation amongst the mournful
occupants of the Members' Stand, and the space reserved as the Tattersall's Enclosure was
filled with bookmakers of a decidedly " serious" type of countenance. Certainly before every
race there were cries of "Four to one bar one!" but these cries seemed only to lack the
stately accompaniment of the deep low tones of a cathedral organ. I have heard of "Horse-
Chaunters." Were these specimens V Echo, latest edition, answers " I don't know."
The space in front of the Grand Stand was tenanted by commissioners of a comparatively
gayer character, hut even these reminded one strongly of vergers on furlough, teetotallers
thinking about backsliding, and undertakers' men out for a holiday. The gorgeous costumes
of Brighton and elsewhere were conspicuous by their absence. I searched in vain for the
bright green opera-hat, ornamented with red stars, I knew so well; the white cloth coat,
adorned with blue braid and pink buttons, I had so often admired; the thousand and one
sartorial combinations—pleasing and unconventional—that had so frequently filled my heart
with joy. No, everything was staid and solemn. To ward off my tears, I lunched, and, after
lunching, as a necessary consequence 1 plunged.
I record this plunging with, a feeling 01 bitter sorrow not unmixed with shame. The
numbers for the Richmond Welter Handicap Plate had scarcely appeared upon the board
before I was "on" Brilliancy for a sum beyond—far beyond—my means. I turned away
my head as the solemn cadence of the race-bell told me that the horses had started. Then
came a murmur—a soft, regretful murmur-^from the sad-eyed ring-men, and the news had
Not satisfied with
•Aged Selling
, .... _ i of bereaved
book-makers told me that the rich prize had been carried off by another. I must have
looked sad, for even the gentle-voiced " Member of Tattersall's and Newmarket Rooms," who
(so his ticket informed me) "to prevent paying on two would entertain no objection on any
consideration after the winner had passed the scales," sighed audibly as he politely refused
to admit my assertion that I had really won because I had meant to back Queen Frederica.

Galled to the very quick a£thi<fresh fail-
ure, I hurried to the paddock, where the
authoress of my undoing was to be sold by
public auction.
In the centre of a melancholy ring stood
the mare. The Auctioneer—an individual
of highly respectable, nay, truly ecclesiasti-
cal appearances-was busily engaged in re-
cording the bids. By his side lounged a
sportsman in a pith hat of peculiar con-
struction. This sportsman, who was bid-
ding vigorously, was described, in the
glowing language of the hammer, as "a
Real Conservative English Gentleman." I
asked who the "R. C. E. G." was, and
heard, to my horror, that (from his name)
he was apparently connected with a well-
known Circus! The " R. C. E. G." appeared
determined to buy the mare, evidently be-
lieving (as an excellent judge of horse-
flesh) that Queen Frederica might one day
be trained to dance a kind of polka with
the Clown, or at least to take a glass of
wine with counterfeited satisfaction with
the Ring-Master. But the owner came to
the rescue; and " the Heroine of the Shep-
perton All-Aged Selling Stakes of 5 Sovs.
each, with 100 Sovs. added," originally
valued at a " century," being bought in for
£609 sterling-, was saved from a "trial of
endurance " in a hippodrome!
My Sabletail disaster did not end my
misfortunes. I returned to the Ring, and
selecting a bookmaker on account of his
personal resemblance to Lord SHAFTESBITBT,
plunged once again.
Do you know what it is to "put money
on a horse "? If you don't,—see the initial
illustration to this article.
I backed Montrose for the Maiden Two-
Year-Old Plate, Sarsaparitla for the Kemp-
ton Park August Handicap, Plat/away for
the Halliford Welter, and Van Tramp for
the Middlesex Maiden. None .of them won!
I was a ruined man. At this crisis there was
but one thing to do, and I did it. I turned
Commissioner myself. The Biter ceased to
be the Bit!
Only the last race remained, but I had
heard something about it that made me
believe that taking the odds against every-
thing would be what they call in the City
"a_ thoroughly sound commercial trans-
action." Accordingly, with unbounded
generosity, I took One Hundred, nay, One
Thousand to One, against the Field ami the
Favourite coupled. Unused to this disin-
terested dealing, the Public rallied round
me with cheerful alacrity. A quarter of
an hour before the time advertised for the
running of the race I inspected my book,
with the following highly satisfactory
result. I found that I stood either to lose
rather more than Half a Million of Money,
or to win no less a sum than £8 10*. 4Jrf.!
Having this pleasing amount in my pocket,
I now secretly withdrew, as it was really
useless to remain any longer. But my
Honour (without which life is quite value-
less) was preserved. My absence had just
become noticeable when the last race (as I
knew it would be from the first) was de-
clared void!
Need I add, as a man of the widest sym-
pathies, that it was most comforting to me
to consider (when I was well on my way
home) that the Public I had left behind me
so full of hope, so full of confidence, at
Kempton Park, were just the sort of people
to bear the discovery of their unexpected
loss—after a slight display of excusable irri-
tability—with very edifying equanimity?
The answer will be in the negative, my
dear young Friend, if you really know

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
0, another week of
it! Eheu! (Mon-
day, August, 16th,
-Lord,). The
Member for Eng-
land, of course,
must (and will) he
in his place to the
bitter end, faithful
at his post like the
Pompeian Senti-
nel, though half
choked by dust
and ashes from the
'Dead Sea Apples
of barren debate.
Though mountain
lure, wave woo, or
moor invite,
Logomachy detains
him day and
night,
To futile labour
doomed, shut out
from fun,
A Sisyphus and Tan-
talus in one.
As for Essence,
roses to patient
labour yield odor-
ous oils, but what
toil shall extract
agreeable attar
from the arid
thorns of Lord STRATHTEDKN AND CAMpBEXL's'Turcophil talkee-talkee? Punch passes on.
(Commons.)—GOBST, our Sir Molester Deadlock, still interrogative: "Will the Govern-
ment undertake not to advise HER MAJESTY to prorogue Parliament until the result of
General ROB BETS'8 march is ascertained?" Hardly necessary, replies Lord HABTINGTON,
with grim humour, since the Hon. Gentleman can secure that result himself if he be so
minded. Obstruction asks Sir Dead-lock to enter into an engagement not to move on!
Then five hours' talk over six votes in Committee on Civil Service Estimates. Class II.
(Law and Justice) Salaries of Prison Commissioners and functions of Visiting Justices
canvassed closely and contentiously, Mr. Alderman FOWLEB having weakly suggested that
if they could not trust the Government in " trifles," there would never be an end to public
business, (the innocent Alderman!) Lord R. CHTJBCHILL "rounded on him" (school-boy
slang seems so appropriate to the proceedings of Lord RANDOLPH) as "an old Tory" whom
he, for one, didn't mean to follow. Has Toryism then, in the persons of the three Members of
the fourth party, indeed taken a new departure?
To heckle with questions and bother with Bogeys
Appear the Fourth Party's preposterous rules,
The Young Tories think the Old Tories are fogies,
The Old Tories know the Young Tories are—fule«!
"Fules" in a parliamentary sense, of course.
Tuesday (Lords).—

Lord RBDBSDALB plaintively repeats his query, " What will Peers befall

double-thonging to Mr. DILLON, the sedition-spouting, outrage-provoking Member for
Tipperary. Beware, Mr. DILLON, of Mr. Punch's baton or Toby's teeth I
Then Lord HABTINGTON, on Indian Finance, at present synonymous with Indian Pickle.
Some consolation is to be found in the apparent fact that but for the Afghan War there
would have been fair surpluses during the last three years. As it is, there is a deficit of Nine
Millions or so—quite a little "surprise packet" not discovered until a few weeks before the
late Government left office. The military expenditure had, in fact, been pleasantly under-
estimated to the tune of Nine Millions, owing to the peculiarly humorous system of keeping
military accounts in India. Military expenditure not being included in making up the books,
the Indian Government had to "guess at it," and as Lord HABTINGTON said, "had framed
these Estimates upon any basis without making any inquiry into the amount actually
expended." Government will have to "guess again," as they can't "give it up." Thus—
but the affair naturally lends itself to dramatic treatment :—
VERY ODD FIGURES!

But, after all, the whole affair's so easy.

John Bull. Nine Millions out, and on the wrong
side? Clearly
Hy Indian books must hare been kept most
Viceroy. Ah well, yon see, that "usual basis"
bogged us,
And those "conjectural estimates" quite
fogged us.

Viceroy (with interest). Ah!

John Bull (impatiently). Bah!

This is the price I pay for pinchbeck glory—
Out by Two Hundred (very near) per cent!!!
I hope that you and STKACHEY are content.
Of course I don't suspect financial riggers,
Bnt these are—what you cut—Very Odd
Figures!
Mr. Punch thinks so too; and, while
desiring to imitate Lord HABTINGTON'S
generous and gentlemanly forbearance, does
not wonder that Mr. FAWCBTTwas "gener-
ally cheered" when he said that "some
radical change must be introduced into the
system of Government in India." "Radi-
cal" means Liberal, of course. The pre-
posterous system, yet more than the peccant
individuals, is the thing that demands
pitching into.
Wednesday (Commons). — Employers'
Liability Bill pushed on to Third Reading
in spite of "assistance" from the Young
Tory Trio. In Committee on the Savings
Bank Bill, Mr. MAGNIAC hotly complained
of the manner in which it was being
"rushed through." Legislation by " ugly
rushes " is indeed a thing to be strenuously
deprecated; but isn't it rather lunatical,
or Magniacal, for those who deliberately
wrangle to complain loudly of being hur-
ried? As reasonably shall the wayfarer
who idly whittles his staff to chips, grumble
at having nothing to walk with.
Thursday (Lords). — The Employers'
Liability Bill read a First Time, without
discussion. All will not be such plain sailing:
presently perchance.
The discomforting story of Isandlana, as
told by Lord CHEXMSFOBD, interested, if it
did not wholly satisfy, a scanty House.
Lord SruATHNAIKN, who had somewhat
modified his original plan of attack upon
the conduct of affairs in Zululand, made
nevertheless a lively onslaught on the Short
Service System, Civil War Ministers,
Hybrid Amateurs," Military Education
(founded on the study of antique depravity
and modern fiction), and incidentally upon
the conduct of the Campaign in South
Africa.
Lord CHELMSFOBD, in a clear speech,

Archaeology at Home.
SPEAKING to the Archaeological Association the other
day at Devizes Town-Hall, Earl NKLSON observed that
meetings like theirs gave people "a zest to become anti-
quaries, to gather together little bits of their family
history, and of the history of their respective parishes."
Cultivated in this spirit, Archaeological researches in-
stead of resulting in mere dry bones, may be expected
to reward investigators with the discovery of skeletons in
the cupboard.

The Champions of " Sport" valorously stuck to their guns, CHAPLIN
indignantly minatory, BRAND bitterly monitorial. Sunday Amend-
ments aimed more or less directly at the "vital principle " of the
Bill, ruthlessly negatived by the " Mechanical Majority." Mean-
while, the " Little Victims " (see Cartoon), by no means regardless
of their doom," prick alarmed ears at the coming shadow, which,
whether it be that of the Lord, who would preserve them for Sport,
or of the Farmer, who would pot them for crop-preservation, can
bode but email good to Puss ana Bunny.
Friday.—Both in the Upper and the Lower House a considerable
portion of the Sitting was occupied by heated discussion on the con-
duct of Public Business. In wrangling over waste of time our legis-
lators wasted more. Mr. Punchf however, does sincerely pity the
poor Peers, "kept in" with nothing particular to do. The Commons
at least are hard at it.
Mr. BALFOUB moved—" That it is inexpedient in the interest of
public business that important measures should be brought under
the consideration of the House at a period of the Session when it is
impossible that they should receive adequate discussion." Every-
body agreed with him in principle, but the blame for the actual con-
dition of affairs was tossed from side to side of the House like the ball
in a well maintained rally at Lawn Tennis.
Lord HABTINQTON was humorously arithmetical, calculating that
six Members of the House (Mr. GOBST, Sir HENBT WOLFF, Lord
RANDOLPH CHUBCHILL, Mr. BIGGAB, Mr. O'CoNNOB, and Mr. FINI-
GAN), all Ishmaelites or Irishmen, had, between them, made 407
speeches, and that, if all Members babbled in the same proportion, the
average length of a Session would be eight years or so, "a result
which," as is frequently observed by EUCLID in similar circumstances,
"is absurd."
Of course Lord R. CHUBCHILL was virtuously indignant, and Mr.
CHAPLIN savagely recriminatory. Well, the Government has made
mistakes, and the present position of affairs is sufficiently exacerba-
ting, but complaint certainly does not lie in the mouths of the little
minority of Obstructives, who cannot be acquitted of having wan-
tonly wasted time with a view to impede legislation which, they
dislike, and discredit a Government which they detest.
Tongue «. Time. Tongue had rare sport.
Tongue wagged long till Time ran short.
Tongue complained. "You 're out of Court,
For wa»te makes want," was Time's retort.
What little time could be spared from recrimination, was (in the
Commons) devoted to further discussion of the Hares and Rabbits
Bill.

CHAPTEE XII. (CONTINUED).
WE know what was the wrath of Juno when Jupiter demeaned himself to
?lay at "Follow my Leda," and wasn't her husband a greater Divine than
upiter? and, if so, wasn't his conduct worse? And could it be any comfort
to her to think that if he hadn't metamorphosed himself into a swan, he had
at least made an old goose of himself, and that history so repeats itself as to
show how birds of a feather flock together?
Whether this all passed through Mrs. DOWDIE'S mind I cannot say, for
my acquaintance with this estimable woman does not warrant me in the
•onclusion that she was acquainted with anything more than a very vague
outline of the classics, and had probably never heard either of LEMPRIEBE
or of OVIDIUS NASO. Be this as it may, she gave La
Marchesa such a look, as, if looks were lightning, would
have blasted her on the spot, and then taking the Bishop
by the arm, pushed him in front of her, two steps at
a time, up the staircase to his dressing-room, wnere,
locking the door, she wouldn't let him leave the apart-
ment until she had so combed his hair, that had become
seriously disarranged during his recent unwonted exer-
cise, as to enable him to reappear among his guests,
sleek, tidy, cool, and comfortable, as if nothing extra-
ordinary had happened.
Once, and once only, was he able to slip away from his
wife, and whisper in his Chaplain's ear,
"1 'm immensely taken with La Marchesa."
The quick-witted Italian, who was eating a Neapolitan
ice specially provided for her by Mr. MATTIX, looked
up with an arch glance, and replied, softly,
"Come to the photographer's, and we '11 be taken to-
gether."
"You will if I catch you!" exclaimed the now tho-
roughly roused Mrs. DOTVDIE, who had returned, unper-
oeived, to the refreshment-room. "And," she added,
turning to the Bishop, "you'll be well shaken before
taken, I can tell you. As to you, Madame, there's a
reckoning—
"Indeed!" interrupted La Marchesa. "I thought I
was indebted to your hospitality for the ice; but as
there's a reckoning, GIOVANNI" (this to the Blue Boy),
"you have a shilling in my purse—give sixpence for the
ice, twopence for the cakes, and the rest of the change
she can keep for herself."
"Insolent!" hissed Mrs. DOWDIE, whom rage had
now almost completely mastered. And to what act of
violence she would have proceeded it is impossible to
say, had not Archbeacon OVERWAYTE, who had been
present during the greater part of this scene, whispered
in her ear, "The professional person has sprained her
ankle in dancing. She must leave the house at once. I '11
see to it."
She pressed the Archbeacon's hand in silent gratitude,
and for the second time led the Bishop away from this
dangerous proximity. Dr. DOWDIE retired, looking back
over his snoulder, and intimating, by signs, his nn-
dying admiration for his too lovely and too fascinating
guest, and his great sympathy for her in her misfor-
tunes.
It was not likely, however, that the Archbeacon would
be allowed to succeed on such dangerous ground; and
just as he was about to offer his arm to La Marchesa,
he was suddenly recalled to a sense of conjugal duty by
a sharp tap on the back of his head from his wife's fan,
which was welcomed with a ringing laugh from the light-
hearted Italian.
"I was going to help her, my dear," explained the
Archbeacon, "because she's sprained her ankle, and is
lame."
"Never you mind about her ankle, Archnoddy; you
just let her ankles alone!" was that excellent lady's
retort.
"But she's a lame woman!" pleaded the Archbeacon,
warding off another rap of the fan.
"If she's a lame woman" replied Mrs. OVEBWAYTE,
"let a lame man help her. And you 're not a lay-man,
are you, Archbeaeon? No; so you just come along,
and insist on ARABLE'S proposing to MOBLEENA while
Mr. MATTIX gets himself entangled in this quarter."
And the far-seeing Lady walked her husband off at a
critical moment.
And where was Mr. MATTIX all this while P
Seeing that he could do no good where he was, by the
side of La Marchesa, and feeling that any interference
between the Bishop and Mrs. DOWDEE would not be
opportune, he. determined to fortify himself with a few
glasses of the liqueur of Ancient Thomas, and then, while
the whole party was occupied with the doings of the
Italian troupe in the tent, he would strike the blow,
and propose to MORLEENA. She could but refuse him:
and if she did, was there not La Marchesa in reserve f
He would not begin by proposing to the Italian; her
style of life was too uncertain for his fixed ideas of clerical
preferment; and then to put himself at her feet would
be to throw himself into the arms of what was now a
thoroughly anti-Mrs.-DowDlE party, and, yet awhile at
least, he could not afford to break with the Bishop's
wife. If MORLEEWA accepted him, he might still indulge
his artistic tastes in an occasional flirtation with the

Marchesa should she choose to reside in Small-Beerjester, and make
friends with Mrs. DOWDIE. Big with these resolutions, Mr. MATTIX
drained the contents of a quart of Ancient Thomas, and then mur-
mured to himself something about " coming at once to the pint."
At that moment MOBLBESA was strolling forth into a secluded
part of the garden, in expectation—I must admit it, though it does
seem sly in a heroine—of Mr. ABAIILK happening to come out,
before the Show was half over, to walk in that direction. After
all, dear Ladies over forty, is it not what some of you would do
yourselves F And if so, why not allow that it was not such great
slyness in even so average an heroine as my MOBLEENA? Mind, I
don't set her up for a pattern to follow. If she had been an example
to be followed, Mr. ARABLE would have known that, and he would
have been the_re by now. No; she does not pretend to be a pattern;
and I do not intend to make an example of her.

SPORTING INTELLIGENCE.
(The Colonel "auittt " at the Brutseh Meeting.)
AKE sport, Sir. The World's mine Oyster,
and here in Brussels is one of our " Opening
days." Uprouse ye, then, my merry, merry
men, &c., &c. But I may tell you, confi-
dentially, that for the last month or so the
brave Belgians have been celebrating the
Fiftieth Anniversary of their Independ-
ence. The Brussels streets have been during
this time in a chronic state of banners and
illuminations. The heroes of the hour seem
to be " The Combatants of 1830 "—compli-
mentary allusions to them on bunting and
in coloured lamps appearing at every corner
of almost every road. Before leaving, I
saw one of these aged quarrellers staggering under the weight of
an enormous tricoloured nag. He was supported on either side by
friends who urged him frequently to "hold up," and formed an
amusing " feature " in a vague procession consisting, apparently, of
all the restaurant waiters of Brussels, in dirty evening dress, His
Majesty the King in a State carriage, a few loungers in red dressing-
gowns, the entire Belgian Army, and other little odds and ends of
an equally effective character. That there might be no doubt about
the identity of the veteran brawler, he was labelled " a combatant,"
and appeared to be suffering from the combined infirmities of ex-
treme old age and long-seated intoxication. Why he had selected
1830 for a display of his pugnacity, and after making this quaint
selection, what he had done, and ,why he had done it, seemed
to be secrets known only to himself and perhaps the keeper of the
archives of some local police-station. These mysteries, however,
appeared to be quite in keeping with the spirit of the moment. The
Belgians have celebrated with the utmost heartiness the jubilee of
their freedom, when no one (except, possibly, two or three profes-
sional historians) seems to have ever heard of their slavery. I, for
instance, should have entirely missed the Liberation Fetes had not
my instincts as a veritable' gentlemans-jocke-'ors-ridere-sport-ifl-
man " (as they called me in Brussels) carried me over to " assist" at
the courses of Boitsfort.
My journey to Belgium was not quite uneventful. On the way to
Dover I met two frank young English lads, who told me that they
were going to Paris (at the instance of a strong-minded maiden aunt)
to pick up a knowledge of the world, and to acquire accomplishments.
Learning this, I thought it a duty I owed to their aged and sensible
protectress to point out to them that an opportunity iww offered for
the commencement of what might be termed the finishing touches to
their education. I suggested that they could not do better than
entrust me with a sum (small or great—for preference the latter), to
be expended by me on their behalf at the Brussels Races. Sad and
strange to say, although so young, they seemed to distrust me, and
even appeared to harbour a suspicion that in making my proposal I
had some selfish object of my own in view! Need i say that, inex-
pressibly shocked, and hurt to the very quick, I indignantly repu-
diated the unworthy insinuation, and for the moment had no more
to say to them. However, I am naturally of a forgiving nature, and
when we got to Mid-Channel my heart softened towards them,
happen to be an excellent sailor myself, and it pained me deeply to
see how greatly the poor young lads were suffering. To cheer them
up, I again broached the subject of the Brussels investment. At
first they evidently misunderstood me, for they with extreme diffi-
culty (so great was their lassitude) produced their tickets. Gently
explaining that I was not the Steward.but only a staunch and true
friend, they seemed to recognise me. With tears in their eyes, they
offered me all they had in the world to say no more about it. As a
token of my hearty forgiveness, I helped myself to a considerable
sum, and noticing that they were really quite unequal to the fatigue
of any further conversation, left them. On arriving at Calais, I
immediately took the Brussels train. When I reached Lille, it sud-
denly occurred to me that I had forgotten to ask for their address,
and had, moreover, neglected to furnish them with my own! Nothing
could have been more unlucky, as mutual recognition had now
become almost impossible! Having the worst memory in the world
for faces, I felt sure I should never know them if I met them. They,
on the other hand, would have considerable difficulty in identifying

ever, it is some satisfaction to me to consider that the money en-
trusted to me was expended in Brussels in the way proposed, to the
^Pcannot'help thinking that " le Sport" must have been introduced
originally into Belgium by a Mr. ASTLET or a Mr. SANQKB. When
I arrived at Boitsfort, I found that the old traditions of the Circus

had been closely followed. There were the customary reserved
places, the well-remembered band in uniform, the never-to-be-
forgotten obstacles to be brought to the fore just before the last act—
the ever-exciting race between barking dogs with nervous inatten-
tive monkey jockeys. There was only one omission—there were no
Clowns. However, the lighter part of the entertainment was chiefly
supplied by "the Military." Between the races a number of lads,
in hussar costumes, practised the seemingly-not-difficult art of
tumbling off their horses, to the great delight of an applauding
crowd of spectators. The King, too, who, as usual, arrived in State
(the chief mission in life of His Majesty seems to be to appear at the
fag-end of a procession when everybody is going away), had a
"comic scene all to himself. The monarch had ordered the whole
of his Staff to assume winter garments, while reserving to himself
the right of wearing white nankeen pantaloons. The contrast be-
tween the lightly-clad Sovereign and his heavily-bullioned Court
was most mirth provoking, and caused endless amusement (as it was
evidently intended to do) amongst the loyal bystanders. This regal
joke and the half-witted manoeuvres of the "cavalry" prevented
the " Reunion de VEte" from lacking a vein of humour.
The Betting Division consisted of a wicked-looking omnibus
labelled "L'Office du Sport, Paris MutueL" and some half-dozen
Ring-men of the ordinary type so dear to 'Appy 'Ampton. The
omnibus seemed much neglected, in spite of an elaborate apparatus
for the rapid issuing of tickets, but the Commissioners were doing
excellent business. "Key var lar Shervarlt Key var Marglauf
Jug-you-lare A-gal-itty f" shouted a gentleman who looked as if
ht had been warned off Newmarket Heath so effectually that he had
not stopped running until reaching Brussels. On inquiry 1 found
that the gentleman was inviting the public to " back the mare " or
"Magloire," or to lay "evens on Jugulaire." As he spoke, the
Band in the eccentric military costumes began to play a gallop, and
the horses cantered round the course in the good old-fashioned circus
form. I looked at my " seal programme officiel," and was not sur-
?rised to learn that the first race on the list was the "Prix de
Hippodrome "—quite as it should have been. I also became aware
that the " Society for the Encouragement," the Belgian Government,
and the town of Brussels between them had contrived to "offer"
about £500—to be expended upon prices for five races. Encouraged
by this liberality, some half-dozen skinny animals (that appeared to
be very much missing the four-wheelers in which seemingly they
had passed their youth and middle age) made a pretence of racing.
They were ridden by English jockeys (speaking their own language
with an idiomatic force quite unknown to the Conventional Dialogue
Books), who treated the authorities with supreme contempt. The
horses started when and how they pleased. The most interesting
race of the day was the " Prix du Fort Jaco (Steeple-chase Handi-
cap)," of which a "plan of the course" was given in the official
programme. The idea of fixing such an event to come off in the
middle of August shows how thoroughly the Belgians have mastered
"Let Mysteres du Sport Sritannique." The road was full of
"obstacles." There was a brick wall about the height of a lady's
fan, a hurdle, a " hurdle English," a " river" (quite six feet broad),
and some clay. The clay was evidently a great feature, as it was
printed in capitals. How the enfranchised cab-horses surmounted
these difficulties, I know not, as I left before the race was run, as
you shall hear.
In the kindness of my heart, my dear young Friend, I thought I
would give the brave Belgians a little lesson in English. Selecting
a secluded spot, I opened my umbrella, and commenced shouting,
"Don Giovanni Egalite! Qui va le chevalt Qui va Don Gio-
vanni t Qui va le cheval!" Perfectly charmed with the purity of
my Parisian accent, an enthusiastic crowd surrounded me, and over-
whelmed me with gifts of a pecuniary character. When my pockets
were quite full, I thought it time to commence my lesson. I there-
fore quietly closed my umbrella, and began to move away. Upon
this, my kind friends asked me a number of questions in French.
Taking off my hat, I returned, "Me English, me not understand
French—nong comprenny!" and then began, for the sake of the
exercise, to run towards the Station. Then there was a scene of
indescribable emotion. The mob rushed at me, and made the most
frantic attempts to offer an explanation. It was of no use. I would
be only satisfied with English, and English, alas 1 they could not
offer to me. By this time I had left the course, and soon afterwards
(with the assistance of the Police and Military, who showed the
utmost gallantry), returned to Brussels. At the polite invitation of
the authorities, I left the same night for England.
Brave, deir Belgians I Good-hearted people, so proud of your
independence, so free from guile, so happy in your jubilee 1 In spite
of your prewnt joy, I am sure that some of you have not quite
forgotten Your sincere well-wisher, THE COLONEL.

THE GREAT LOED MAYOR AT BOURNEMOUTH.
(From a Local Correspondent.)
THERE, now I can goo to
bed comf urtable, and
lie my head on my
piller in pace, fur now I be
content; I've had my wish,
and han't a got nuthun
moor, in the way o' sights,
to set my heart upon and
long for in this here blessed
wordle.
'Cause why, now at last
I 've a sin the LABD MA YOB.
Now I 've set eyes upon the
LAUD MATOB o London.
I went to Bournemouth
o' Wednesday o' purpus to
zee un. 'A come down
vrom London to open the
new Pier in state. I zee un
do't. I zee un in his
gownd and goold chaain.
I zee un in his grandjer.
I zee un in his gloree. I
zee Sur FRANSUS TRUSCUTT,
Lard Mayor.
The Mace-Bearer wi' the
Mace went uluor un; tile slioruils ioller'd aater un; Mr. tJherulf
BATLEY and Mr. Sheruff WOOLLOTON. I thinks to myself how nigh
Sheruffs sounds to Seruffs. But the fanner han't got no wings,
and they doan't want fur bodies.
Aaater they, come others I heer'd called Civic Uflishles, Auficers
o' the London Corporaaishun; preshus fine, I belave ye.
Wi' the LARD MAYOR wus the LADY MAYORESS. She got a kay and
took and unlocked the maain entrance to the new Pier. I zee her.
The band o' the Grannydear Gards, playun, marched up the Pier
wi' I UN GODFREE at the head on 'urn, as fur as the t'other end.
There the LABD MAYOR had a sort o peeaper, or a writun on vellum
o' sum kind, persented to un, and he wished Success to Bourne-
mouth.
Aaater that, zum on em gie'd the LADY MAYORESS a goolden kay
to the maain enturnce, fur to let her in there anywhen she 'd a
mind to.
Then the LARD MAYOR fannerly declared the new Pier to be fully
opened.
In the aaternoon there was a public lunohun in the Winter
Gaarden, and five hunderd zat down to teeable. Amnng um 'sides
the LARD MAYOR and the LADY MAYOBESS was the new Vicar o'
Bournemouth, Bishop RYAN, Bishop o' somewhere eke, an 'a zed
grease: as't med well take a Bishop of anywhere to zay afoor the
LARD MAYOR o' London.
In the avenun, a grand show o' vireworks was let off on the Pier,
to the LAUD MAYOR'S honour.
Who is there amungst all the grandees of all the vorren naaishuns
on the veace o' the arth like the LARD MAYOR o' London City?
What's the Emperor o' ROOSHEB or PBOOSHER to un? What's
Prince BISMABK t What's his High-and-Mightiness the Sultan o'
TUBKEY? What's his Holiness the PWOOAP? Not vit to hold a

THE MUD-SALAD MARKET HOTEL-GUIDE.
MUD-SALAD MARXBT is renowned for its hotels. They are not
palaces, but caravanserais—real comfortable old-fashioned taverns.
Being in the centre of London, these taverns are always full of
visitors. The " Mudford" takes in families; the " Gravystock" is
devoted to bachelors. To know how to get comfortably to and from
these taverns, is part of the science of London life,—thanks to the
Duke of MUDFORD and the management of Mud-Salad Market.
There are three days of the week—Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Satur-
days—which it is desirable to avoid, both tor incoming and outgoing.
If business or pleasure will not allow the intending visitor to avoid
these days, the following directions may be useful:—
If you arrive by a morning mail, leave your cab about half a mile
from Mud-Salad Market in any direction, and engage a porter to
carry your luggage on his head. This will conciliate the market-
Ole, and probably decrease the amount of "chaff" which is
y bestowed upon any person who tries to make the passage of
the market without belonging to the fruit and cabbage trade. The
passenger will pick his way carefully through the vegetable refuse,
and, it his nose is at all sensitive, he will use a oamphoretted hand-
kerchief. If his clothes hare any appearance of respectability, he
must not mind being called a "toff," and told that he "has got
'em on." When he arrives at the hotel, he will find it useless to
go to bed, even at the most remote back corner of the building, as
the purchase and sale of vegetables involves almost as much noise as
a French .Revolution. If he goes out on business, he will do well to
keep away till late in the afternoon or evening, by which time the
Duke of MUDFORD'S scavengers have made things superficially
decent. If he wishes to leave his hotel, to catch an early train on
Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday, he will do well to engage a market
porter tor his luggage, and walk out of Mud-Salad Market as he
walked into it. Hi. should turn a deaf ear to any offer to fetch one
of the phantom vehicles known as "night cabs." They may start
from a remote stand, but no amount of had language will ever get
them to their destination. The Mud-Salad Jungle is too much for
them. The off days—Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, not to
mention Sundays—are less noisy and mud-salady. but more aro-
matic. On Thursday you may get a sight of bright flowers or a whiff
of fresh mint; on Friday you get nothing but a stale smell of vege-
table matter—
"They may sweep and may polish the place ns they will,
But the scent of the cabbage will cliDg to it at ill.'"

Concerts. In-
deed there is
something
radically, or
Tory-ly if you like it, wrong about these entertainments. There is
either too much bar or too much music. And the majority of the
audience pay more attention to the bar at the back of the stage than
to those which are delivered in front. If you were to do away with
the music, it might be alleged that the entertainments would not be
concerts in the strictest sense of the word. And if you were to do
away with the bar, nobody would come and promenade. As it is, one
has to hear a song under the following circumstances:—
Vocalist. "On mossy banks reclining,"
Deaf Bucolic. What does he say was shining?
Vocalist. "We sat, my love and I,"

At the Adelphi Forbidden Fruit is drawing good houses, and that
despite the heat of the weather, when the sensible man hates plea-
sure even worse than he does business. Forbidden Fruit has been a
very hard bit of work for the Adelphi—both Actors and Audience.
They once played the Merchant of Venice at the Prince of Wales's,
and a very nice, pleasant, chatty, gentlemanly play they made of
it; but the exertions of H.E.H.'s servants to reduce Shytock to the
drawing-room, were as nothing to the labour of the Adelphi villains
a get down to light comedy. When you have been in the habit
of cutting people's heads off, firing at landlords from behind hedges,
;hrowing inconvenient witnesses down wells and over precipices, and
generally displaying as much contempt for human life as if you
were a Home-Rule Member of Parliament addressing an Irish mob,
t is a struggle to do nothing wickeder than to use a little playful
equivocation to the wife of your bosom, nothing more desperate than
to imbibe rather freely in public gardens. And when, as an audi-
ence, you have been in the habit of having your feelings harrowed,
and have nightly witnessed the triumph of Virtue over Vice, it is
almost an insult to you to be told to laugh at the very people you
have hitherto paid to make you cry. J. G. TAYLOR is first-rate
is 'Sergeant Suster, and the humorous situations bring out the
utherto latent drollery of Mr. PATEMAN. When Melodramatic Miss
IELLA PAXEMAN—pulchra, not "horrida Bella "—condescends to
stoop to folly " what can a wondering public do, but admire?
Miss JECKS, as the virtuously indignant Spiers-and-Pond Barmaid,
is very good, and Miss MARION WEST comes out just strong enough
as the rather objectionable Zulu. Messrs. LLOYDS AND PARRY'S
scenes are ingenious and effective, and the entire piece is as well
"mounted " as usual by the Messrs. GATTI.
But—"a Comic Drama, by DION BOUCICAULT." Arrah, be aisy
wid ye.DioN! It's all part of the fun to say that Mr. BOTTCICAULT
wrote Forbidden Fruit. He write it—not he! This was how the
comic drama was written :—
ACT I.
SCENE—A Bedroom. Clothes distributed with artistic confusion
about the room: a Waistcoat in the fire-place, a Shirt in the
bath, a Watch in the fender, and a Latch-key and some change
in the boots. Person of Convivial Habits in bed. He wakes.
Person of C. H. Oh! ah! What a headache I have got I And
how thirsty I am! (Drinks his bath.) Where was I last night?
Let me see. To begin with, I dined at LIMJEEB'S. Three of us, yes,
the Captain and ARMSTRONG the Gentleman Jockey. Two, three,
four—yes, we had four champagne-cups, and then, why we did have
port. So we did drink port on the top of champagne. No, we did
not, because I remember having several glasses of green Chartreuse.
Ah! ;but that was afterwards at the Captain's Club. We must
have had bad port. And then we went to the theatre—which was
it? I remember we had to go down-stairs. Then of course it was
the Criterion, for I remember now that ARMSTRONG said the Ameri-
can bar was so handy between the Acts, and during them, too, from
the amount of gin-slings we had. It was a very good piece we saw,
rattling good, and made me laugh, though I have forgotten what it
was about. Let me see. There was a husband running away from
bis wife, and Cremorne Gardens, and men sending false telegrams to
their wives. Very funny, very funny indeed!
ACTS II., III., AND IV.
The same as Act I., varying the locality of the dinner, and the
quality (not quantity) of the libations.
ACT V.
Person of C. H. "I must really eschew sack, and live cleanly."
I want money. I will become an Author. I will write a comic
play. Let me see. What was that about husbands running away
from their wives, and going to Cremorne Gardens, which they are
always playing at the Criterion? I remember now. I will combine
my recollections of what I have seen very much after dinner for some
years at the Criterion, and adapt them for the Adelphi, and call
them Forbidden Fruit.
Arrah, now, Mr. BOUCICAULT, is not that the truth intirely,
darlint?
No more on theatres or things theatrical this week. A wealthy
aunt from the country insists upon accompanying me to Her
Majesty's this evening, where she has not been since she heard GRISI,
LABLACHE, and somebody whom she calls TEOMBONI, but who is not
known to fame. She is desirous to see whether Operas are given in
the same way as they used to be, and whether the ballet still keeps
up its character. She is grieved at there being no restriction as> to
evening dress, as she fears that it will do away with the " coopdial"
of the house, and prevent the Court Ladies attending in their dia-
monds. Good soul, what should she know of the season, or of that

I DID not go to Honolulu tiny more than BISMARCK went to Canossa.
"We will not"—the Reichskanzler. OTTO FUBST VON BISMABK
SCHON SOMETHING, I forget what, should have said—'' We can not go
to Canossa." I should have quoted the historic declaration in its his-
torical "plat Deutsch" (best German " plats,".orplates, are made at
Dresden); only my memory is beginning to play me sad tricks; and
not having li.v)>cuI.NCKN and KARTOFFELSKOPF'S Great English-
German Lexicon at hand, I could not, for the life of me, remember
whether " go" is rendered in the Teutonic-Sol-Fa speech of the music-
loving Fatherland as "gehen" or "gangen." In Romaic Greek to
go is rai6ri6v(t>fty, and to go away is to ™K«ivtaooitnr. But I am sure
that HIMMA.KCK said that he would not go to Honolulu—I mean
Canossa.
Mem. I know Canossa (a small town near Reggio, in the ex-
Grand-Duohy of Modena) very well, and have spent many happy
days there at the good old Albergo of the Can del Fpmo di Terra, kept
by jolly old CAMH/UCCHKKO. I bought an indisputably genuine
CA N A i. KTTO from candid old CANDIZUCCHBRO for an almost nominal
sum, inclusive of butter, pepper, and salt, (what odd media the great
Venetian master used 1 Mr. HOLM AN HUNT, and the members of the
Painters' Guild, should look to the list of CA.NM.KI id's vehicles,
which were not always gondolas) and sold it, the picture, at rather
a high figure, to my poor dear friend MIBZA TATEB KHAN: ("Who
says he can't?" the estimable ALLBUT ALLHOT, used jestingly to
ask) who was Secretary of Legation in the days when CANTA CU/.M K
AN vMAN KHAN was Persian Ambassador at St. Petersburg. Ah! the
delightful Nevskoi Prospect. "Neva," shall I see thee more! And
there are as many naves at the Great Kasan Church, as there are
knaves among the waiters at DOMINIQUE'S Restaurant.
But how was it, you may ask, that 1 didn't go to Honululu. Well,
in the first place, I remembered that Sandwich—(do you remember
GEOBGE THE THIRD'S story about " JEMMY TWITCHKB?" this was
not .the Lord SANDWICH, whose Lady was a friend of NINON DE
L'ENCLOS, and fought a duel with the Earl of STAIR, who, for all his
much vaunted politeness, was in the habit of "stairing" very rudely
at people, and remarking, when remonstrated with,'' itare super anti-
quas viai," to which the Earl of SANDWICH retorted, "Per Start
tneglio state qui," and so knocked him down on the staircase, and the
pork pie that had a diamond ring in it P)—I say that I remember (I
hate parentheses, and warn all young journalists against using those
"figures of speech" unnecessarily)—that Sandwich in Kent was
nearer the Reading-Room of the British Museum than Hawaii.
Mem. Touching the porcine pasty alluded to above (the modern
Greek for one is Trhiucolivruiv TOV xatpov), I am in a position to state

that the Right Hon. WILLIAM PITT did
not exclaim, in his last moments. "Oh,
Britain! Oh, my country!" "What he
really said was, "I think that I should
like one of Bellamy's pork-pies." Lord
ELION (not the nobleman whose mansion
was lately burglarised—-pardonnez mot le
mot—but the famous Chancellor, whom,
from the fact of his living at Doubting
Castle the Chancery suitors used to call
Giant Despair), together with Mr. ADDINO-
TON SYMONDS, and Old GEORGE BOSE (who
invented whitebait, and "Mrs. BROWN at
the Play," but who was prematurely cut
off, thus leading CHATEAUBRIAND patheti-
cally to exclaim, "II a vfcu ce que virent
les Rotes— Fespace d'tin matin, and left
all his property to Jhis nephew AHTHTTR, on
condition that he should assume the name
of SEETCHLEY), started off at once on horse-
back for London. On Wimbledon Common
they were pursued by a gang of juvenile
highwaymen, crying, "Throw out your
mouldy coppers!" but ELDON, having
succeeded in stunning one of these young
desperadoes, by cleverly hitting him over
the head with the Great Seal (which never
left him, but which, for safety's sake, was
placed in a Gladstone travelling-bag), the
illustrious trio reached the refreshment-
room of the House of Commons in safety.
They returned to Putney (by way of
Melton Mowbray), with no less than seven
pork-pies. But it was too late. With a
sad smile, and in a faint voice, the expiring
Prime Minister—the " pilot who stormed at
the weather" as the Aunt of the Jaco-
bins" called him—murmured, "Roll them
up in the map of Europe, and send them,
with my compliments, to Mr. WATLING.
They will not be wanted until the next
Police Orphanage Fete at the Alexandra
Palace."
Mem. BELLAMY (whom SHERIDAN used
to call "Dinnerbellamy," and who always
vehemently denied the imputation of having
written the "Letters of JUNTOS"), was at
first very loth to part with his pork-pies,
which, as he wittily remarked, never per-
formed out of London. "Well, you may
take them," he said at last, "as they are
for Mr. PITT; but there will be no MOORE
of them for the BURGESSES of Putney."
A rare wag BELLAMY! When SAMPSON
WOODFALL, the Printer, was in the custody
of the Sergeant-at-Anns (your health, Cap-
tain GOSSETT, and all your wives' and fami-
lies', and may thev live long, and prosper!),
the prisoner's table was supplied from the
Commons refreshment-room (whence the
popular saying, "Short Commons, and Long
Parliamentary Returns;" and BELLAMY,
when the captive, on being enlarged, paid
his bill, jocosely observed, WOODFALL, do
they call you? By cock and pork-pie, Sir,
you have been a Windfall for me!"
Instead, then (as I have endeavoured
briefly to explain), of going to Honululu,
I went to Hammersmith, mainly, I admit,
for the purpose of clearing up the mystery
which has long puzzled me as to why FOOTE
(or was it Serjeant BALLANTINE?) should
have acquired such a reputation for wit
by saying that peas ought to be sent to
Turnham Green oecause that was the way
to Hammersmith. Surely it would have
been more humorous to say that epicures in
August should go to Kensington, seeing
that the old "Court Suburb" (I remember
my great-grandmother telling me that she
went to school at Birchington House—or
was it at Bridlington Quay? but my
memory is getting very treacherous—an old
red-bnck mansion on the site either of the

Albert Hall, or of Baron GRANT'S palace, or of the New Kensington Vestry Hall), because"it
is the way to Ham-and-Peas-Smith.
I found Hammersmith slightly dull. All the smithies were closed, and there were no
Nasmyth's steam-hammers for sale at the ham and beef shops. Everything on the bridge was
in a state of Suspension: in fact things in general reminded me of the play of Hamlet with
the part of Hammersmith (STANFORD'S map of the Environs of London is the best: the veracity
of LYSON, who was also the topographer of the Afghan War, is not above suspicion) omitted.
There will be no "EooEs" next week, as I am going to have my hair cut. I am much
pained that the psychological and archaeological research necessary to explain exhaustively
why I went to Hammersmith in lieu of Honululu should have precluded me from replying
to eight hundred and seventy correspondents, who ask me whether HANNAH MORE ever wrote
cr sang any comic songs besides " The Hackney Coachman." The fact is but I must have
my hair out.—Addio! THE ELECTRIC LIGHTER,

possible care of yourself, to go to bed early, and to be
particularly abstemious in what you eat and drink, to
be met by FKANK JOLLOND, who never had a day's

his way to ask to join a lively party at dinner, that
evening, at the Star and Garter.

I

the
LOVE to be lazy
lounge 'neath
limes,
And glance at orations one
reads in the Times!
It makes me quite hot read-
ing speech after speech—
I cool my parched throat
with a ripe ruddy
peach—
The Eighth's gone and
past and they re still in
the House I
The Eighth gone and past—
not a bang at the grouse!
I read and I marvel, 'neath wide-spreading trees,
And pity the sorrows of grouseless M.P.'s.
I swing in a hammock and smoke cigarettes,
And list to the lawn-tennisonian pets;
Who make themselves hot: they should take my advice,
To sit and sip calmly some something-and-ice.
I swing and I slumber, blow ring after ring,
I dream and I wonder, I ponder and sing:
When lulled off to sleep by the humming of bees,
I dream of the droning of dismal M.P.'s.
I 've nothing to think about, nothing to do—
I drift down the stream in my nutshell canoe:
With pipe in my mouth, and with paddle in hand,
I would not change places with one in the land!
Who 'd broil at St. Stephen's at this time of year,
Who might be so happy by Hambledon Weir?
As white sails are fill an by the light summer breeze,
Sincerely I pity those luckless M.P.'s.
All day is my own, I can just throw a fly—
Not dream of the SPEAKER, nor " catching his eye "—
Can lounge in a punt, go to bed when I please;
1 'm heedless of all Parli'ment'ry decrees!
'Tis lucky sometimes, when you can't reach the goal.
Most fortunate I—at the/oo< of the poll.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. P.'S REPRESENTATIVE.
(On a few new features, and some older ones, at the Alhambra—
Farewell to Facart.)
La Ftlle dti Tambour
Major is still running: a1
the Alhambra, and doinj
sufficiently good business t<
warrant the Management
in calling her The Fill oi
the Alhambra. Miss EDITH
BLAKE is the dashing
Vivandiere, Mr. MERVIS
the Tambour Major, Mr.
LESLIE the amusing Due
della Volta—an exagge-
rated type of the Sean
in School—while Miss
LOSEBT has been replaced
by Mile. PETRELH as
Stella, and Miss FANNY
LESLIE'S part of the Little
Drummer is both well sung
and played by Miss ST.
QuiNTEN, who has been
the round of all the Comic
Operas in town, and having
played in Madame Favart
and Lee Cloches for I don't
know how many hundred
nights—which sounds like years in the life of a young Actress-
seems at last to have found herself quite at home at the Alhambra.
It was no easy matter to come after Miss FANNY LESLIE as the Little
Drummer, but Miss ST. QUEKTEN in succeeding has succeeded.
Two new features—not that there are any old ones here—" nobody
is old or ugly in Ba-ath," as Mr. Pickwick's M.C. said—have been
introduced among all the pretty features for which this house is
celebrated. The Gavotte in Act II., and the Grand Ballet d'Action,
which description, though suggestive of a Ballet of Barristers—(what
a beautiful thing would be a Balkt d'Action-at-Latc .'.'—why, Messrs.
GILBERT and SULLIVAN'S Trial by Jury would be nowhere beside
it—but it might be played first)—is explained away by the title.
The Alpine Brigands. The music has been "composed expressly''
byM. G. JACOBI. Why " expressly "? Why put on all the steam •
Why make it " hurried music " P However, there it is, and excellent
it is from first to last, and throughout characteristically dramatic.
Can I describe the plot? I will try.
The scene is " A Wooded Ravine near Milan." Festivity of happy
Peasants, who are gluttons at dancing, and should be described iii
this respect as Ravine-ons. They don't converse,—only dance anri
"keep the tambourine a rollin'." Count Lelio (that most admirable
of pantomimic artistes, Mile. TH. DE GILLEKT) arrives suddenly
and tells a thrilling story, in which the happy Peasants appear more
or less interested, though perhaps a trifle annoyed at the inter-
ruption.
Angry Brigand Petruccio (Miss MATTHEWS) follows the Count,
apparently demanding his legal fare,—dispute,—and there is just
going to be a serious difficulty, when in bounds an elegant Lady,
who seems to belong to some corps de ballet, probably performing at
the Milan Theatre,"with whom the naughty Count Lelio has eloped in
a hurry, without giving her time to change her dress. She is really
Zanetta, the sister of the Brigand Chief, and is played by Mile.
PEKTOLDI. With great presence of mind she settles the difficulty as
to the cab-fare with her father—an extra sixpence does it, added to
the prospect of a dance with Pipeta (Mile. ROSA), the Innkeeper's
daughter—and then everybody bursts into dance, until the Count,
with unaffected affability, joins the Brigand Chief's sister in a
pas de deux, and finally dropping the Count entirely, and going in
to make a day of it and popularise the aristocracy with the ravine-
ous peasants, he indulges in such a dance as even interests the blase
peasantry, and is loudly encored by the audience.
Then Mile. ROSA and the Chief of the Brigands have a turn, much
to the delight of the latter, into whose arms she skips in the most
wonderful manner, bringing down the house—and a bouquet.
Very telling music, M. JACOBI'S; quite story-telling music, as it
ought to be; and that's a catching tune, polka time, to which ROSA
and the Chief execute their pas. The Innkeeper's daughter's Pa
doesn't dance; he belongs to the Opera, and doesn't appear till the
ballet d1 action is over, when we go from pleasure to business, all the
better for the relaxation. The Gavotte comes on about half-past nine,
and the Ballet at ten. So much for the new features.
Madame Favart appeared for the last time on Saturday. It has
been a genuine, but to me an inexplicable success. The management
might avail itself of the threeiweeks' recess to make those Little-ease
upper private boxes capable of holding more than one person com-
fortably. The arrangements, too, for entrance and exit—off the stage
I mean—are about the most inconvenient—to say the least of it—in
London. Uncommon report—for common report cannot be trusted—
speaks highly of Olivette, the new Offenbachian Opera, which is to
appear shortly—at least not shortly, but in Three Acts—quite long
enough for any Comic Opera, however sparkling, says
MB. P.'s REPRESENTATIVE.
P.S.—During the hot weather, when so many London Theatres
are closed, it is not astonishing to read of the great success of

"DRINK" :N THB PROVINCES.
THE TOP OF THE GAY-MARKET.
ABOUT half a mile westward of Mud-Salad Market, as the crow
flies, is an unlicensed, ill-regulated, open-air, kerb-stone, midnight
kina of cattle-market, called the Gay-Market. We say "as the
crow flies" adviiedly, for no crow of respectable habits would pro-
bably fly in that direction. The Gay-Market, as it now exists, is
mainly the creation of Lord MIDNIGHT BRUCE, the Police, and the
Middlesex Magistrates. The Police may possibly derive some profit
from this market, and Lord MIDNIGHT BRUCE and the Middlesex
Magistrates may be under the fond impression that by turning a
certain order of Vice into the open highway under the glare of the
gas-lamps, they are forwarding the cause of Virtue.
Does it occur to these theoretical moralists that instead of
regulating the few who are hopelessly bad, they may probably be
corrupting the multitude whose tendency is good f
No city in Europe presents such a disgraceful picture as the top of
ihe Gay-Market between midnight and one or two in the morning.
Eere is a Metropolis which has worked for years and spent countless
millions of money to carry off its sewage unobserved, apparently
•evelling in a public exhibition of its worst moral impurities.
Sere the sort of foreign produce which the powerful pencil of JOHN
LEECH, years ago, showed that JOHN BULL would willingly dispense
irith—enters into unholy competition with Moll Flanders, who some-
;imes finds a coronet in the mud, but more often goes to the work-
louse. Bullies, betting-men, shop-boys, swells—riff-raff of all kinds
—mix with the overdressed females, and block up the pathway with
a crowd whose object is unmistakable. The roadway is half filled
with lingering broughams and cabs driven by knowing cabmen,
while the police look on, like spectators at a show, in speechless
admiration, or hopeless bewilderment.
Which is the best system ?—A licensing body of some six hundred
more or less ignorant and prejudiced gentlemen—chiefly amateurs—
who leave London, with its four millions of people, without a Casino
or a Music-garden, and thrust our necessary evils under pur noses in
;he most public of our public highways, or a public licenser who
mows his business, and provides a few places, under responsible
management, where even the most degraded have no excuse for
launtmg rowdyism?
The Tunis Question.
THE Italian snubs the Frank and doth impugn his
Right to stretch eastward. This a piteous lune is,
They with each other tumble out of tune,
Because each wants the other out of Tunis.
The Mudford. Metropolitan Disgrace.
THE ^Esthetic Poet of the Period would find a congenial subject
n Mud-Salad Market, where he will be thoroughly able to realise
he Beauty of Decay. The place is disgustingly delightful to any
>ne who can revel in refuse and be rapturous over rottenness.

PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.

MONDAY, August 23 (Common*).—Dillon v. Fonter.' No cose,
but seven hours of wordy abuse, which, to summarise, were as useful
and entertaining as to make a prfcii of the annals of Donny brook or
Billingsgate. Mr. DILLON, the Irish Guy Fawkes manque gets his
deserts elsewhere. Enough! Limp, listless, unlistening Mr. Punch
lounged on his seat and mused. "Ton of ice used daily to oool at-
mosphere of House of Commons! How much would it take to oool
Members' tempers P" Dreamily working out this sum, Mr. Punch
slept and found himself and the House transferred to the fabled
region where men's words freeze to silence as they fall from their
lips. Hurroo I mentally vociferated Mr. P.. as SULLIVAN inaudibly
shouted nonsense to a welkin that wouldn't ring, and blatant
BIGGAB'S ineffectual facial spasms writhing forth inaudible vocables
to an air void of acoustic properties, reminded him grotesquely of a
mute Medusa in speechless tantrums. Hurroo I Here at last is a

(Common*.)—" Come Sack to Erin!" sing the Irish Members in
chorus, but hardly in unison. Mr. Punch declines the invitation.
He has pictorially expressed his view of the position (see Cartoon),
and FAT had better take his friendly advice than give heed to coun-
sels of confusion from Cork, or traitorous tips from Tipperary. Mr.

OR,
THE LATEST CHRONICLE OP 8MALL-BEERJE3TEK.
BY
ANTHONY DOLLOP.
CHAPTER XIII.
A HUM SHBUBBEBY.
N a small room
near the hall,
ap_art from the
dining-room
where Mrs.
DOWDIE was
occupied with
her numerous
guests, and far
away even fron
the secluded
corner where
the Bishop was
sitting discus-
sing old p
and telling
side-splitters in
an under-tone
to his inferior
clergy, Mr
MATTIX had
been assisting
his solitari
meditations
with copious
draughts o"
the spirituoui
liquor of An
cient Thomas.
^ ti,.. His mathematical mind was occupied with a pro
"" * -position which within the next half-hour he wa
^determined to make to MOBLRENA. He tried tc
screw himself up to consort pitch; but on leaving the room fc
follow MOKLEENA, his head came in sudden contact with the shar
floor, when it struck him that the screwing operation had not been
completely successful, and that there was still a screw loose some
where—the somewhere being apparently in the region of the knees.
"Screwed!" he murmured to himself as he rose from the ground
"Screwed, but not sufficiently tight." And he stammered over th
five-syllable word as if his tongue were in a knot.
But MOHLEENA was in view, and, with the influence of the Ancien
Thomas still on him, he assumed a cordial manner as, guiding him
self by the hedge, he followed her into the shrubbery, and approache
her cautiously.
"Tchk!" he said, playfully.
MORLEENA was startled. She was not aware of having bee
pursued.

"I beg you will leave me alone," said slie, in a freezing tone.
t_But a gentleman in whose veins the fire of the Ancient Thomas
ill burns, is not so easily frozen.
"I want to have—li'le"—(he meant "little," but emotion pro-
ably choked his utterance)—" li'le con'sash'n with you," murmured
[r. MATTIX, tenderly.
"As little as possible," answered MOBLEENA, seeing no way of
scape, as the man blocked up the narrow path, and extended his
rms so as to clutch both sides of the shrubbery.
The time for letting out his great secret had arrived. How should
e let it out to the best advantage? It was not like a fly, or a news-
aper, to be let out by the hour. No. It must be done now, or
ever; and, on the whole, he preferred now. To fall was, he saw,
nevitable; and to go on his knees would be at once easier, safer,
nd more effective. He knew he was alreidy saying unutterable
hings with his eyes, winking and leering, while nis face was
wreathed in smiles.
"Do not arshk mer to leave yer, MOHLEENA," he whispered, with
he impassioned look of a_half-converted satyr—" Listen, my onion
—I mean my own one I " " But the latter was a stronger expression
han the other, and MOBLEENA drew back. She saw how he was
,ow, and she could not dissemble an expression of the deepest
Lisgust.
There are some moments in life when both men and women feel
hemselves imperatively called on to make a face; in which not to
Lo so is a struggle against a very natural revulsion, or is calculated
;o excite a disagreeable suspicion. There are people of both sexes
who never make faces even after the most nauseous and blackest of
•lack draughts; but such are generally dull, close, unimpassioned
pirits, evil-doers, bad livers.
He wished to give her his arm, but MOHLEENA refused it, observing
tat she had a very good one of her own.
"So you have," replied MATTIX, leering at her more rapturously
^i ever—" so you have: it's a boo'ful arm. You 've got wingsh,
too—I mean two wingsh—like angel—an' mush speak t'yer."
"I don't know what you can have to say to me, she replied,
iteadying her eyeballs previous to knocking him down with one of
,hem like a nine-pin.
"Don'tsh yer?" he asked, kneeling on one knee, and steadying
himself with his hands on the other. "Don'tsh yer P Lisht, lisht,
0 lisht!"

dnd|!" Then, as unable to pass him as though he were a bad
shilling, she turned on her heel, and walked away.
He followed her for some distance on his knees, and then suddenly
plunging forward, he grasped her hand, exclaiming,
"0 boo'ful creeshur! Boo'ful creeshur I I love yer to subshtrac-
jhun!" And with considerable cleverness ho suddenly contrived
X) pass his arm round her waist.
But MOHLEENA was too quick for him.
"Waist not, want not!" she cried, and dealt him such a terrible
smack with that little hand of hers, which had had some previous
practice on the devoted head of JOHN BOUNCE, and, as my readers
mow, had sent that eminent reformer flying.
"You're an abominable, horrid, hypocritical man! she screamed
n her just wrath; "and it would serve you right if I told your
Mshop of you, it would! You're a fulsome, fawning, canting,
abominable, odious, nasty, spirituous man! But I 've a brother-m-
law to protect me; and—ah!—would you?" she suddenly broke
off as the undaunted MATTIX, whose passions the box on the ear had
only still further inflamed, tried to imprint a burning kiss on her
plowing cheek, and, without more ado, she gave him one on the left,
another on the right, followed closely by two more sounding thuds
on the side of his head, that sent him through the bushes and down
the slope into the deep muddy ditch below, and there leaving him,
she walked away triumphantly, only anxious to wash her hands of
the contagion as soon as possible.
Mr. MATTES, for whom I confess I have no more love'than has
MOULEENA, and not a whit more pity, overcome by the excitement
and the unwonted exercise, and weakened by the fast evaporating
fumes of the Ancient Thomas, lay unconscious until he fell into a
deep, sweet, refreshing sleep. And so for the present we will leave
him in the ditch, out of which he was for a longtime most unwilling
to come; but when he did come out, it is almost needless to add that
he came out uncommonly strong.
And now it is to be feared that every well-bred reader of these
pages will lay down the book in disgust. What! This a heroine
worthy of sympathy? She is a hoyden, not a lady; a romp, E
coquette, a muscular unchristian woman, a young virago, a bold bad
thing, a minx, a hussy, a tartar, a HELEN MACGBEGOB, a CATHERINE
of Russia, a Queen BESS, a LTJCBEZIA BOBGIA, a rum 'un, a Tom-boy,
a tigress, a lioness, a gymnast, an Amazon—in fact, a bad lot.
Well, perhaps she cannot be altogether defended; and though J
am responsible to a certain extent, yet I must candidly own that her

'A SERVANTS' LIABILITIES BILL."
(In Nubibut.)
BRITONS AND WORKING
MEN,
THE abominable
selfishness inseparably
combined with Capital,
has naturally suggestec
to Employers of Labour
that the Employers' Lia-
bility Bill, rendering mas
ters responsible, in heavy
damages, for accidents
occasioned by the acts or
omissions of their men,
over whom, in many cases,
they can have no control,
ought, in reason and jus-
tice, to be balanced by a
corresponding measure,
with a view to the Liabi-
lities of the Employed.
The apparent equity oi
such an arrangement may
even have rendered th<
possibility of its proposa
an object of some appre-
hension amongst a few oi
the more thinking portion
of yourselves.
On consideration, how-
ever, you will see that you may safely dismiss any such fear from
your too sensitive and scrupulous minds.
The circumstances of your position exempt you from any possible
liability to any serious fine. Blood, you know, is not to be got out
of a post; and you would be bled to little purpose by stoppage of
your wages in case you did anything which made you liable to receive
the " sack" _at your hard Employers' hands.
That, for instance, JOHN THOMAS, is the extent of your liability
in case you leave the coal-scuttle on the staircase, and thereby cause
one of your fellow-servants, or any one else, to tumble over it and
break his leg. We shall see, perhaps, whether in such a possible
event, your master, under the Employers' Liability Bill, if enacted,
will be subject to pay for your breakage. If that is to be his lia-
bility for your carelessness, vexation will probably excite him to
demand that you should be liable to imprisonment and hard labour.
That is a liability, friends, which Employers, no doubt, would
like to see added, by way of make-weight, to the Liabilities of the
Employed for expensive accidents arising from their want of care;
but yon have no real ground for alarm on that score.
There is no present prospect of the introduction of a Bill providing
For the penal liability of the Employed for acts endangering their
fellow-labourers engaged in common employment. Do not therefore
listress yourselves with thoughts that might deter you, coal-miners,
from neglecting to carry safety-lamps, or, if you have chanced to
comply with your Employers' regulation in that particular, might
prevent you from sucking name through the gauze of your lamp to
ight your pipe. Factory hands, you need not let any anticipation
>f increased liability make you unduly anxious to take any super-
luous paini for the safe sheathing of machinery in motion, or mind
overmuch what you are about with lucifer-matohes.
Pointsmen, Signalmen, and the rest of you workmen employed on
Railways, you may safely depend on being laden with no aggravated
lability whatever for getting drunk, or going to sleep, or chaffing
one another when you ought to be on the look-out. Rest content
inth your existing liability for the consequences of your acts—a
liability when they prove fatal, perhaps to multitudes at a time,
practically limited, at the worst, to a doubtful chance of an occa-
sional conviction for manslaughter.

A New Song to an Old Tune.
I SINO the Tragi-Comedy of DILLON, worst of sinisters.
Who terrified the House of Lords, the QUEBN, and all her Ministers,
That is, he would have frightened 'em, aye, scared 'em into fits, Sir,
But that they knew the speeches of this man of wandering wits, Sir,
Were all bow-wow-wow!
Hibernian highfalutin', bosh, and bow-wow-wow 1
He went to Tipperary, did this slyest of intriguers,
And got three hundred thousand men to join the new Land
Leaguers;
That is, he would have got them, just to carry out his plan, Sir,
But the thousands wouldn't muster, so his scheme it failed to
answer
To his bow-wow-wow I &o.
He up and freed poor Paddies all, to their extreme content, Sir,
From owning any landlord rule, or paying any rent, Sir:
That is, he would have freed them, were it done by simply saying it,
But Law, of course, enforced the rent, and PADDY went on paying it.
'Twos all bow-wow-wow! &c.
Then/having'caught him stirring up sedition in the nation,
FOEHTEB to him administered a stinging flagellation;
And every honest man rejoiced to lee him lay the lash on.
And though the biting of the whip put DILLON in a passion,
'Twas all bow-wow-wow 1 &c.
So let us sing long live the QUEEN 1 and long live Ireland also,
May PAT find truer patriots than some he's pleased to call so;
And ne'er may England from her rule of right and justice vary,
Notwithstanding Bogus traitors like the one from Tipperary,
With his bow-wow-wow 1
Hia wicked, wild, wrongheaded, currish bow-wow-wow!
SPIRITED CONDUCT.
LAST week Dr. FORBES WINSLOW gave an account, in a letter to
the Standard, of a visit he paid to a stance given by Mr. BASTIAN, a
"Medium." On entering the house, Dr. WINSLOW says, he was
shown into an upper room with folding doors dividing the bed-room
from the sitting-room. Says Dr. WINSLOW :—
"All lights were now turned out, with the exception of one small jet, and
before long e supposed spirit, clad in dregs clothes, made its appearance at the
door behind the curtains. One of the audience, Mr. CUMBERLAND, apparently
pretended to recognise this as the spirit of his departed brother; but on its
third appearance smothered it with cochineal by means of a squirt with which
he had provided himself, and, jumping forward at the same time, he seized
the spirit, and after having a severe struggle to drag what proved to be some
human being into the room, withdrew, his fingers being nearly dislocated in
the contest. . . . Ultimately, accompanied by Dr. KOLMERS and Mr. CUM-
BERLAND, I insisted on going into the bed-room, but the Medium was stated
to be very ill in a trance. He had, however, time to take off his disguise, but
not to efface all the cochineal from his face. . . . Declaring my identity, I
pronounced the whole thing an imposture from beginning to end."
Bravo, Dr. WINSLOW and Mr. CUHBEBXAND. Permit me to offer
you a cochineal couplet:—
Spirits are slippery as eels to feel;
So, would you cotch a Spirit ¥—Cotch an eel.'

NOTES.
(From the St. Jims's Gazette.)
THERE will scarcely be a more
convincing illustration of the
judicial blindness, the crass in-
capacity, and, we may almost
say, the criminal ineptitude of
the Administration with which
the country (and ourselves per-
sonally) are afflicted than the
substitution of buck-shot for
rifle-bullets as ammunition for
the Royal Irish Constabulary,
who are not half numerous
enough to begin with, and should
be armed, in addition to rifles
and bayonets, with hand-gre-
nades, revolvers, dog-whips, and
snickasnees. Buck-shot is, when
sought to be used for the pur-
poses of rifling tenants, about as
serviceable as lollipops would be.
Buck-shot,forsooth! Buck rabbits
OCCASIONAL NOTES.
(From the Turn P.M. Gazette.)
THE Government authorities
in Ireland have acted with their
usual sound discrimination, ge-
nerous humanity, and excellent
judgment in directing that buck-
shot, instead of rifle cartridges,
should be supplied to the Royal
Irish Constabulary, whose prin-
cipal duties, when they are not
occupied with playing "The Shan
Van Voght," and the " Wearing
of the Green" on the accordion,
in their barrack-rooms, appear to
be the shooting of evicted tenants,
and the tearing down of placards,
affixed to the walls by the local
"WILLINOS. The Irish Police are
a standing monument of mis-
government in Ireland; but the
determination of the existing
Administration to "buckle to"
and hare triggers would suit Mr.
GLADSTONE'S weak-kneed Janis-
saries better. Quousqtte tandem
Catilina abtitere patientid nostra f
If these things are done with im-
punity in the Greenwood, what
shall be done in the Dry? We
are both.
GEORGE CHUMP, a hardened
little villain seven years of age,
described as "of no occupation,"
was lately charged before the
East Grimgribber Bench of Ma-
gistrates, Rev. EBBAN FLOW, Sir
ALTIEHT BISCUIT, Bart., and Lt.-
Col. TBOUNCEM, with stealing a
marigold, value half-a-farthing,
from the garden of the Rev.
ALMOND ROCK. The charge was
fully brought home to the aban-
doned prisoner by the evidence of
Mr. INSPECTOR BLABBERDYNE.
The Rev. Chairman told this
young hopeful (who, it was fur-
ther stated, was a Radical of the
deepest dye), that he was an in-
corrigible little miscreant, who
deserved to be sent to penal ser-
vitude for life. As it was he
sentenced him to three months
imprisonment and a whipping
with the birch. The birch is only
for budding criminals. The hein-
ous crime of stealing marigolds
has increased to monstrous pro-
portions since the coming into
office of a Cabinet of plundering,
blundering, dundering, treaty-
sundering Incapables.
The usual sensational stuff has
appeared about the "ovation"
bestowed on Mr. GLADSTONE, on
his leaving Charing Cross Station
for Gravesend, with Mrs. GLAD-
STONE and family, and on his
embarking at the "Tea and
Shrimps, Ninepence " hot water-
ing place on board the Grantully
Castle. Of course we wept salt
tears when the Right Honourable
Gentleman was prostrated by
illness; but we are weeping
salter, more passionate, and more
indignant tears now, when we
think of the unhappy Mahome-
dans in European Turkey plun-
dered, of their pilaff, their
shintyans, their djabadaulis, their
yashmaks, their yataghans, and
even their hattisherifs (their only
protection from the inclemency
of the weather), by the pitiless
Bulgarians. In tact, we can do
little else but weep now, when
we think of a WOLFF crying in
the wilderness and no man re-
garding him, and a House of
Commons yawning at the elo-
quence of an ASHMEAD-BABTLETT,
bore he never so bravely. Evi-
dently the Deluge has come; and
we (who have fortunately secured
passages in the Ark) can do
nothing but moan and wring our
hands.
in the matter of cartridges,
cannot be too highly commended.
Government by buck-shot, al-
though at the first blush it would
seem to indicate a predilection for
a sluggish policy, will be recorded
with applause in the continued
"History of Civilisation," by
some future BUCKLE.
The fiendish sentence passed by
the amiable trio who dispense
"Justices' Justice" at East
Grimgribber on a poor little urchin
named GEOHQE CHUMP, who had
been guilty of the trifling; offence
of plucking a marigold from a
garden, affords another proof of
the crying necessity of imme-
diately'disestablishing the Church
of England, extending the County
Franchise to the proportions of
universality, and making the
recently published biographies
of ROUSSEAU, VOLTAIBE, and
DIDEBOT, text-books in all the
Board Schools. The wretched
little CHUMP was sentenced to
three months' imprisonment and
a birching. Why not to the
Knout, the rack, the stake, the
bastinado, and the Oath of Par-
liamentary Allegiance 'i Of course
the Chairman of the Bench was a
clergyman. So was the prosecutor.
There was also, we perceive, a
Colonel TROUJTCEM on the Bench.
The time is ripe for the LORD
CHANCELLOR to be told plainly
that he must not put any more
soldiers nor clergymen on the
Bench.
The enthusiasm with which
Mr. GLADSTONE and his family
were greeted on leaving Charing
Cross Terminus for Gravesend, and
the cheers and God-speeds with
which he was acclaimed on em-
barking at the Terrace Pier on
board the Grantully Castle,
should scarcely, we think, be
taken as possessing any direct
political signification. It is to be
hoped, and we would gladly
believe that there are, as many
staunch Conservatives as there
are fervent Liberals who rejoice
at the restoration to health of an
illustrious English statesman and
a thoroughly excellent man, and
who sincerely wish that he may
have " a good time," as the
Americans phrase it, during his
health-trip. We profess very
often in print, and on the plat-
form or in the club room, to re-
gard this or that Prime Minister
as an Enemy of his Country, and
a Mischievous Incendiary whose
head might fall, with great ad-
vantage to the nation, on Tower
Hill; but in our inmost hearts
we do not mean anything of the
kind. We think the Prime
Minister, be he a Conservative
or a Liberal, be he a Beaconsfield
or a Gladstone, a very fine fellow,
and we should be unfeignedly
grieved if anything happened to
ECCLESIASTICAL NOTICE.
ALL reports "requiring confirmation" should be directed to the
Bishop of the Diocese.

THE First NAPOLEON (that greatest of modern Generals) has called
the English a nation of shopkeepers. It was an empty reproach that
met with a sufficiently suggestive commentary on the blood-stained
field of Waterloo. But had not the answer reached the Emperor
from the mouths of the cannon unlimbered before the little Belgian
farmhouse, a negative would as surely have arrived from Wimble-
don—the home, nay, the very birthplace of the National Rifle Asso-
ciation of Great Britain. That excellent Institution was founded
exactly one-and-twenty years ago. Then (as now) the Duke of
CAMBRIDGE appears as President. In 1860 the Council decided

And yet it is difficult to suppose that there could have been any

Lieutenant would clearly understand it, Sir!
Editor to Colonel Contributor.—I mean the non-professional reader.
Colonel Contributor to Editor.—As you wish, Sir.

Here it is necessary to say, for the benefit of the Public (who are
wholly and entirely ignorant of all military matters], that the
Marksman is the person who fires off the rifle. The rifle is a weapon
consisting of a certain amount of wood and steel. This weapon is
loaded (that is ^tilled) with an explosive composition called gun-
powder, and a missile made of lead yclept a bullet. The gunpowder
is put into a tube (called a barrel) first, then the bullet. When
ignited, the powder propels the bullet through the air, and

But take super-

And roll on the tan

They think it delightful to walk on the pier,
And try to create a sensation;
When passengers land, looking pallid and queer,
A cause is for great jubilation:
Let lunatics listen to bands when they play,
And nod to their noise and their jingle—
But let me throw stonet in the water all day
And roll on the sand and the thingle.'
Anemone-hunters roam over the rocks,
All hoping to fish up a tank-full;
They hopelessly ruin their shoes and their socks—
0 why can't they rest and be thankful?
They rave o'er a winkle, a wrass, or a wray,
And sea-weeds that with them commingle—
Bui let me throw lionet in the water all day
And roll on the land and the thingle.'
They think it is pleasant to go for a sail
With wind in a dubious quarter;
When waves " chop about, and they get very pale
And up to their knees in the water.
Let maritime maniacs, wetted with spray,
Discourse on a cleat or a cringle—
But let me throw stones in the water all day
And roll on the land and the thingle!
I 'd much rather take a good pull at ozone
Without all this bustle and riot;
If'well-meaning friends would but leave me alone,
To bask in the sunshine and quiet.
Such labour as theirs fills my heart with dismay—
The thought of it makes my blood tingle—
So I will throw ttonet in the water all day
And roll on the tand and the thingle.'

THE MUDFOG PAPERS.
MESSES. BENTLEY AND Sotr have republished CHARLES DICKENS'S Mudfog
Papert, which first appeared in their Miscellany. Those who remember ALBERT
SMITH'S brochures, such as The Oent, The Ballet Girl, &c., may easily see in
what school he had studied, by reading The Pantomime of Life. But the
other evening, while assisting at a representation of The World, by Messrs.
MERRITT, PETTrrr, and HABBIS, we were tickled into a sudden guffaw by this
line placed in the mouth of Mr. JACKSON as the Comic Villain—" Yell, 'ere
ve are again, as the QUEEN says ven she opens Parlyment!" The absurd
association of ideas struck us as a decidedly original turn of humour. Oddly
enough, on reading the Mudfog Papert, we hit on the following passage in
The Pantomime of Life:—" We take it that the commencement of the Session
of Parliament is neither more nor lees than the drawing up of the Curtain for a
Grand Comic Pantomime, and that His Majesty's most gracious Speech on the
jpening thereof may be not inaptly compared to the Clown's opening speech of
Here we are!" (DICKENS, by the way, omits the " again.") "My Lords and
Gentlemen, here we are!" appears, to our mind at least, to be a very good
abstract of the point and meaning of the propitiatory address of the Ministry."
The authors of The World had probably never seen or heard of the Mudfog
Papert; but, even after this distance of time, let grands etprits se touchent.
The Mudfog Papers are most interesting as a specimen of DICKENS'S budding
lumour. Perhaps the best in the collection is The Pantomime of Life. The
description of the Pantaloon and the Harlequin is inimitable.

the mostwunder-
f ullest chaps as I
knows on. Your
Lord Mayor and
your Aldermuns
gets a good Pren-
tioeship as Com-
mon Counsel, and
so gets hardened
to 'igh livin'.
But a sheriff
comes suddenly
into it, without
any pruppera-
tion, and the na-
tural consequence

other on em is
layd up about

for the fust few
munths, and no
wunder, wen one
thinks wot they
has to go through.
Wot becums on em all? BROWN says they takes their Carridges with
em, and goes to Africa and becomes African Princes. But in course
that 'a only his nonsince. Tho' I was told by a frend of mine, who's
a second hand Coachman in Long Aker, that his master wunce had a
order to paint up a old Sheriff's Coach with lots of red and blue and
gold and silver, and sprawlin liuns and things, and to make two
wopdin hossea as large as life, runnin on fore wheels, and painted
quite natterel, and they was all sent to Africa as a pressent to one of
the Chiefs, who used to have ten niggers tied to the hosses to pull
the Coach along, and he used to sit on the Box and flog 'em all the
way! I shoudn't have liked to have had to wate on Itis Royal
Hiness.

To my mind the hight of human dignety is a full-blown Master
Free Mason with his apron on, and all the ensines of his office!
Many and many a Rite Honnorebble Gent have I had the honner
of assisting down-stairs wen leaving the hospitibble Board; and once
a Royal Pussonidge, who was speechless with emoshun, grasped my
hand, and shook it! I made all my family go thro' the same serre-
mony before I washed that onerd hand.
I don't think as how we perfeshunal Gents is treeted with propper
respek. I heerd a young Swell say, only last week, that he hated
wearing white Chokers, they made a man look so much like a
Waiter! Well, I want to no wot he 'd like to look like? Why,
only a short time ago, a very young Nobbleman, evidently quite
unused to City life, came to a great City Gill bankit, and wen I
went up to him to take his Hat, I made my ushal bow, which I
copies as neer as I can from Royalty, the young Gentleman axshally
shook hands with me and adrest me as Woshupfool Marster! I
never was so taken a back in all my life. I axshally blusht to that
extent that I must have looked like a meer vulgar Country Squire!
I am sorry to see that a lot of Forren Mersenaries has cum over
from France and Gemmany to take the bread out of the mouths of
the fine old English Waiter, tho' preshus little of that common Stuff
they 'd find in mine. I wunder where this here Free Trade is a
goin to take us to? Who ever thought of Free Trade in Waiters?
The thing's ridiklus. And a fine set of fellers they are, to be
sure! They rush about here, there, and everywere, making their-
selves as they calls' it ginerally usefool, & atending to anybody as
wants anythink, the Ijots! No quiet dignety, no orty demeener,
no stickin in one place, whether you 're wanted or not, and, above
all, no conveeneent Defness I Ah! if this sort of thing goes on, it
will cause a nice sort of change, this will! Why at leastlialf on us
won't be wanted at all, and the rest will have to intirely halter
their old system. All werry well for boys; but how about us as
has grown gray in the serviss? My Wiskers, which is wot is called
Mutton Chop pattun, has begun to change colour, and wen I asked
BKOWN how it was that my wiskers changed before my head, he
said, with a laugh, it was beoos my jaws had more work than my
brains. I wonder what he ment, sum of his oharf, I suppose.

WHY THERE ARE NO EGOES" THIS WEEK.
LAST week our esteemed Contributor gave the reason for his con-
spicuous absence. He told us that he was going to have his hair
out. Naturally enough, we were most anxious to know where this
operation was to be performed. There seemed to be some reluctance
on his part to inform us. But in the interests of the public we
pressed the question. The answer was most completely satisfactory.
He had determined on undergoing the operation; and when Our
Own Egoist^ has determined on anything, he does it, or has it done
for him. Yet he is such a wonderful man, that we thought it highly
probable he would disdain all assistance, and insist on cutting his
own hair as, years ago, when quite a child, he had cut his own teeth.
And at that time how irritable he was!
On inquiry at his house, we ascertained that ne had abandoned all
idea of cutting his own hair, and had made an arrangement with a
distinguished professional operator, who cuts hair 'By Appoint-
ment.
Being nervous as to the after-effects of the operation on a naturally
delicate constitution, we arranged to be present on an occasion
which might be fraught with fatal consequences if skilful hands
were not employed. All that money could do, up to one shilling,
was done. With our Artist we were on the spot during the cutting,
of which we subjoin a Cut.

We are glad to say that our excellent Contributor is in perfect
health and spirits, but, owing to the fact of his being compelled 'o
have his hat removed in order to submit to the operation, he did nut,
recover himself quite so soon as we had expected. Previous to
placing himself in the operator's chair, our excellent Contributor
shook hands with the hairdresser, and said that he forgave him. It
was a touching scene.
The patient was under the influence of Gas for more than twenty-
five minutes, and on waking he was understood to exclaim " Sham-
poo!" whereupon a young assistant, with more zeal than discretion,
at once wheeled him to the basin, and put his head under the tap.
This quickly restored him to more than nis ordinary self, and, start-
ing up, he explained that he had asked for " Champagne," and not
"Shampoo." The mistake was easily rectified with a draught on
Pommery & Co. ires sec et bienfrappe.

III.—A VIEW ON THE FHENCH COAST.

He hath a figure grand—
Note, as he takes his stand,
Poised upon either hand,
Merry young mer-pets:
about lazy time!—
Come to this sunny clime—
Life is a flowing rhyme—
Pleasant its cadence I
Zephyrs are blowing free
Over the summer sea,
Sprinkling deliciously
Merry Mermaidens!
Despite the torrid heat,
Toilettes are quite complete;
White are the little feet,
Fair are the tresses:
Maidens here swim or sink,
Clad in blue serge—I think
Some are in mauve or pink—
Gay are the dresses!
If yon know Etretat,
You will know M'sieu la—
Oh, such a strong papa 1—
Ever out boating.
You '11 know his babies too,
TOTO and LOLALOTT,
All the long morning through
Diving and floating.
Oh what a merry crew!
Fresh from the water blue,
Rosy and laughing too—
Daring and dripping!
Look at eaoh merry mite,
Held up a dizzy height,
Laughing from sheer delight—
Fearless of slipping!
Drop them! You strong papa,
Swim back to Etretat I
Here comes their dear Mamma,
Seeking for her pets!
A SEASONABLE SUBPEISE.
(We visit the Alexandra Palace—by the merest chance. Our Report.)
•••; wu, lur a umner out oi town at some new place, and an alfresco lounge! In
Paris, in Brussels, in any Continental city, we should have known what to do; but here—
nothing. The Play was not the thing at all. Richmond? No; if there were any amount of
Richmonds in the field, we are tired of the place, qua dining. Purfleet, Greenwich, Graves-
end! With Titanic whitebait, and muddy river? No. Like -Sir Charles Coldstream, we
were used up. Nothing in any one of 'em.

mond, i urfleet &<>., a needless Alexandra ends the song. Besides, Palaces are horrid places."
We speak boldly in the Eklektikon-but the fogies are asleep. "Let 's try it," urges TOBY
And he opens the A.B C. "How do we get there?" we inquire, yieldingly. Then we object
that it is too late. "Not a bit," cries TOBY MOBY. "Waiter! Hansom!"
We place ourselves in TOBY'S hands. It may be the blind leading the blind, neither of us
i£* ac<lualnteS with the place; but TOBY and ourselves know our way about blindfolded
iromAings Cross we went to Wood Green, where we descended just as the "eloamins"
had set in, about 7.30, and seeing before us a very undignified sort of half-illuminated
entrance, which proved! to be "The Palace Gates," we presented ourselves to two Check-
takers, who eyed us suspiciously, inspected our railway-tickets carefully, and finally
3B.SS6CL US HI*
fn«,e« "T£WS ap|?tiaipg'Jre hour.]ate, and so we engaged a pony-trap to make the ascent
a the Pahce. The Postilion, evidently aware that he was carrying CJESAB and his for-
ies, took us at a solemn pace up the hill. Fearing to stagger the officials by the
impressive grandeur of our arrival in state, we pulled up, well in the shade, gave the
Postilion largesse, bade him to keep his own counsel (or to retain him when necessary),
and smiling to nobody right and left we entered the building. TOBY was for going to see
6 'W6 'resolutely !" there is but °ne entertainment for us!
, who' was waiting for some one to come in and see Mr.
™ , led us to the sal/e a manger. We selected our table, by an
window, with a view of nothing in particular (lit up) in the distance, and there sat
down. The table was laid for eight; so
with ourselves in the chair at the head, am
TOBY MOBY on my left, it looked as though
we had invited guests, who had thrown us
over at the last moment.
Undepressed by this, we summoned the
waiter. He flew—in an opposite direction
Again, "Wai !» "Yessir!" and he
presented us with a bill of fare just to
amuse ourselves with while he was busy
and vanished out of the window like ai
uncaged bird. "Wai !" "Yessir I'
He was back again—and away. Could we
put salt on his tail? How to catch thai
waiter. "Wai !" "Yessir!" and this
time he handed us the wine carte—and once
more flew out of the window. A marvellous
waiter! Was he a spirit P
But these wonders did not allay the
pangs of hunger—though sweet music from
a mysterious piano arose and calmed the
savage breasts for a while. At last—unable
to shoot the waiter as, like Folly, he flew,
we walked up to the Master of the Feast,
and gravely informed him that we had
studied the menu twice carefully, that we
had heard two tunes on the piano, and were
thoroughly pleased with everything so far
—but might we dine? Would he command
the tricksy sprite of a waiter, by some
mighty spell, to serve us with—in fact—
our dinner? Mr. PEOSPEKO, the Master-
civilly did this—most civilly, and a capital
dinner was_ served. Grouse excellent.
Champagne first-rate. * Everything good.
And then—we strolled forth. Once more
the distant lights intrigued us. Beautiful
and extensive grounds, and oh, the loveliest
night!!
People coming up the steps told us that
something was going on—as we understood
;hem at flrst—" on three legs." This turned
out to be their way of pronouncing, "On
the Three Lakes." So thither we wended
our way. Time 9.30. Sounds of music and
•evelry. Thousands of twinkling coloured
ights. Marvellously beautiful effects of
ight and shade, while the electric light
was thrown on one of the three lakes,
around which was a crowd—reminding one
if the Gathering of the Clans—listening to
he band and to a singer in the Pavilion on
*he border of the water.
Our surprise at this scene was only
equalled byour intense gratification. Here
we were. Where'( Surely at Baden-Baden,
ir assisting at some fete on the Continent-!
A really fairy-like scene, and within the
easiest distance. A great boon to the tired
^ondoner, who has no Vauxhall, no Cre-
norne, to go to. And to our thinking-
firework night excepted—f ar surpassing the
—but comparisons are odious.
This is emphatically no puff, but tardy
ustice done to a place of which we have
litherto steered ulear—no puff, we repeat,
xcept as a return for a breath of air on a
rery hot night, and one of the most stri-
kingly picturesque al fresco scenes we've
ome across for years.
At ten we began to return. Being uneer-
.ain as to trains and stations, we inquired
f an official. "Oh," was his answer,
,the trains go anyhow now."
Fancy a Bradshawcompiled on this plan!
lowever, we found the trains going quite
egularly, not by any means "anyhow,"
nd so we returned rejoicing. To all who
re compelled to remain in the Little
rillage, we recommend this night's outing
o the Alexandra Palace.

STRAND [Central]
ONB Saturday morning last May, a Cabman, not too well versed in
the ways of London, determined to drive his empty cab from the
centre of the Strand, to meet his grandmother at the King's Cross
Station. He tried Bedford Street, and found it blocked with carrots;
he tried Southampton Street, and found it blocked with turnip-tops;
he tried Exeter Street, and found it blocked with cauliflowers\ and
he tried Burleigh Street, and found it blocked with geraniums.
Looking up "Wellington Street, he thought he saw an opening through
a forest of cabbage- and basket-waggons. Tilting against one of the
latter, he brought an avalanche of strawberry-baskets on his head,
and nearly lost a wheel. Recovering from this, he tried to get
through Bow Street, but found an impassable crowd round the
prison-van of a popular murderer, as well as a barricade of coster-
mongers' barrows. With great patience and perseverance he passed
at last safely through these obstacles. In Endell Street he was de-
layed by a little prize-fight; and when he reached Grower Street he
found the roadway a little difficult. A gas-pipe had exploded, a
water-pipe had burst, and the Vestry were repairing part of the
highway. He turned down Wobnrn (or Gee-Woburn) Place, to
enter Gordon (or Trap-Cab Square), but the gate-keeper had gone to
one of his three daily lunches. On the gate-keeper's return, the
cabman was refused admission. His cab was empty. Two trucks,
a pig, a dray, a waggon, two calves, a donkey, and a tradesman's
cart were also sent back, not coming within the Duke of HUDFOKD'S
patronising regulations.
The .Cabman was ingenious. He gave a small boy twopence to get
inside the cab, and then applied again with this important passenger.
He was admitted. Before he got half through Gordon (or Cab-Trap)
Square, the boy jumped out of the cab, and ran away. The Cabman
was helpless, and looked for a passenger. There was not one to be
seen. He drove to the Gordon Street Ducal barrier, and was re-
pulsed; he drove to the Taviton Street Ducal barrier with the same
result; and so on to the Endsleigh Street and Upper Woburn Place
Ducal barriers. He got off the Mudford Estate on to the Flint-
Skinners' Estate, and was refused a passage on any terms at Burton
Crescent. He became bewildered, wandered in his route, and tried,
for no particular reason, to get into Mecklenburg Square by way of
Heathcote Street. He was not going to any particular house, and
was kept outside like the Peri. A few sheep, pigs, horned cattle,
carts, and drays were playing the parts of other Peris, and were
referred to 50 Geo. 3, cap. 170. He got on to the Doughty or Tich-
borne Estate, but as he was not going to the house of a subscriber to
the gate-keeper's salary, he was thrust back. He wandered again,
and found himself face to face with the London University barrier
at the end of Gower Street, maintained to provide artificial quiet for
a tenth-rate hospital. Turning, bewildered, from this imita-
tion Ducal barrier, he got, somehow, into the Tottenham Court
Road. He had lost his grandmother, and tired his horse. He
plunged desperately into a refreshment-house. It was not a Coffee-
palace.

CHAPTER XIV.
AXOTIIKK LOVE SCENE.
"WHAT an afternoon 1" said MOUI.HENA to herself as she entered
her sister's boudoir. She was staying with the Archbeacon and his
wife, who had not yet returned from Mrs. DOWDIE'S party.
She looked out of window at the sun setting, and she wondered
whether, if she had a partner to set to, she would blush as deeply as
the^sun. And who was to be her partner, after all? Not JOHN
BOUNCE—he was dismissed; not Mr. MATTIX, that was clear. Had
not Mrs. Arohbeaoon whispered in her ear that Mr. ARABLE was
most eligible? Did not Mr. ARABLE hold the Preeentorship and
Percentorship which her father, in consequence of the agitation set
on foot by the PennyPrometheui and JOHN BOUNCE, had been com-
pelled to resign? Was not this an inducement? Well; and if
MOBLEENA chose to take this view of the situation, who can blame
her P Not I, for one, most assuredly.
She was aroused from her reverie by a step on the hearth-rug.
"Don't let me disturb you," said Mr. ARABLE.
"Not in the least," she replied, vaguely, for she was conscious at
that minute that he was disturbing her.
Then it seemed as if they had nothing further to say; and so he
stood twiddling his fingers on the hearth-rug, while she continued
looking out of window at the sunset.
Presently he aiked her,
"Have you ever seen a ghost P"
"Never—to my knowledge," was her answer.
Then he nervously made one with his pocket-handkerchief, and
moved cautiously up towards her, working the puppet with his
fingers, and causing it to perform various exaggerated actions.
"Do you know what it is doing now P" he asked, bashfully.
"No. What?"
"He is making love."
She did not dare ask to whom, so he only told her, as he came
from behind the fire-screen where he had been hidden, that it was a
very old-fashioned amusement.
"Do you mean making love is old-fashioned?" she inquired.
"Yes," answered Mr. ARABLE, gently laughing; "and the
pocket-handkerchief puppet, too."
"Ah!" returned MOBLEENA, gently; "I like everything old-
fashioned."
"So do I," returned Mr. ARABLE. And then he begged her
pardon for stepping on her dress, and she replied that it was of no
consequence. Then he walked up and down the room irresolutely;
and as she gazed out on the sun, she felt tear after tear slowly
coursing down her face.
Mr. ARABLE was restless. He executed a few steps of a hornpipe
on the hearth-rug, and then performed the first half of the menuet de

la cour. At last he stopped in front of her, and unable to bear the
silence any longer, he asked,
"Where are you going on Sunday?"
"To church, she answered, simply.
"Will your mother know you are out?" he continued, in an agi-
tated tone.
"I have no mother, Mr. ABABLE," she said, turning her head
away as another and a bigger tear trickled slowly into her mouth.
"I beg your pardon," said Mr. ARABLE; but if you go to
church, with whom will you go?"
MOBLEENA looked up. She felt that things were looking up
just now, and she sympathised with them and looked up too, meeting
his calm, eager, melancholy gaze.
Wouldn't he speak plainer? Would he not make some sign?
And if he did, was she a Freemason to understand him and return
it?
"I go with my father—when he accompanies me."
"Accompanies you! Is he the Organist 'f"
"Sometimes. But he is still the Beadle."
"Ah! But if he is not with you"
"I shall be alone—alone—in the wide world!" And again
another and a far bigger than any of the others trickled down her
cheek.
"That's a whopper!" exclaimed Mr. ARABLE.
"Mr. ARABLE !v she cried, and rose from her seat; "you dare
accuse me of an untruth P"
"No, no," he hastened to explain. "When I said ' whopper,' I
alluded to the tear, not to any statement of yours. It is like the
best place at the Opera—it is a Grand tier!"
"Oh, Mr. ARABLE, how can you joke?" she murmured softly.
"I don't know how I can," he replied in the same tone, "but I
do. Perhaps I was wrong. I own I was unwarranted in asking you
the questions I did. I would not have hurt your feelings for the
world; but I am glad now that, besides the inquiry as to your
mother's knowledge of your being in or out, I did not inquire whether
she had ever taken in washing, and had parted with her mangle."
"Oh, Mr. ABABLE !"—It was all she could say, she was so com-
pletely taken by surprise.
He went on:—
"Yes, such a question would have been indelicate—very unmanly.
I ask your pardon."
"I grant your grace," she answered softly, withdrawing from him
to some distance.
"You do!" he cried, deeply agitated, and taking several steps
backward. "You grant my grace! I, a middle-aged bachelor,
who really never learnt dancing, and only know a few steps of the
hornpipe and minuet! You grant my grace! Ah! MORLEENA"
And there he stopped.
"Go on!" she murmured, looking piteonsly up in his face from
the other end of the room.
"MOBXEBNA 1 'Go on!' I am going on! I feel I am going on
—anyhow!" And in another moment, regardless of his white tie,
he had clasped her closely to his clerical waistcoat. How it was
done, whether he had drawn her to him, or whether they had
bounded up against one another from each end of the room, they
could not tell. Nor can I declare. Such things are; nay, such
things are of daily occurrence. There was a sympathy between
them which thrilled through them like an electric shook; for the
moment they had lost their heads and their hearts; she had his, he
had hers; he was she, and she was he; she was the Prebendary and
Precentor, and he was MORLEENA: each was either, t'other was
both; neither knew who was who! And she was the witch that had
charmed his life and drawn from his lips the first kiss he had ever
given to woman, and that made him feel that now for the first time
in his bachelor life he began to realise above all relatives and beyond
all antecedents the simple theory of what was what.
"Oh, let me go!" said she—'' let me go now!" And she bounded
like a soft roe to her own room, as the Archbeaoon and Mrs. OVKR-
WATTE appeared on the threshold of the boudoir.

Off countless cousins they " took a snack,"
And loudly clamoured for pots of stout!
They wrung the neck of poor Grandpapa;
They gaily curried my dear Aunt JANE,
And as for superb old Grandmamma,
I never shall see her like again!

of Tippecanoe, was a candidate for the Presidency of the United

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
HEBE'S many a time as
I wunders when I hears
a Washupfool Master,
or a prime Warden, or
a Lord Mare, or a
Sheriff, or even a mere
Common Councilman a
busting away like
thunder about the
rights and priverlishes
of this that and the
other, whether they 're
quite the same sort of
Swells at home. Ah!
that's rather a okkard
queshun for a good
many on us. Tho' I
ain't got any partickler
cause of complaint my-
self, for in course my
perfessional duties
naturally runs me into
late hours. But BROWN
says he knows for a
fact that many and
many a Swell, old as
well as young, gets into
Parliament because it
gives him a nice excuse
for a latch Key. But
then BROWN will go on
so. Owever I do happen
to know that a certain
very iminint sittizun,
who goes it like one
o'Clock wen he's a Chairman, is as mild as a new Stilton wen he's
at home. You wouldn't believe it were the same party. Thunder
and lightning abroad, and milk and water at home. I know it
bekos I once lived with him, but only for a short time. I missed my
society, and my exsitemunt and my fees and my wine. Oh no, it
didn't do at all. And, if the truth must be told, rather different
wittles for both on us. No reel Turtel, and no reel Jam! not of
any Kind, but all quite plane; so plane that I didn't at all wunder
at Master haying so many important dinner engagements. No I
public life quite spiles us all for mere domestick injoyment.
One of the most elegantest dinners of the whole Season was given
last Thursday week by the Fishmongers Gill, which is considered,
and naterally, one of the most important of the lot. They 're a very
nice respectable set is the Fishmongers, tho a leetle too libberal in
their Pollitics for my money. Much as I likes Libberalityin most
things, in Pollitics it means Change, and, like Masters and Wardens,
I wants no change.
That bright jewel of a Soldier, Sir GAJJNET WOLSEY, spoke well as
he always does. He goes right to the pint, like a charge of Cavalry.
I likes to hear him stand up for the young Soldiers. He says they 're
just as good as the old uns. Ah! I wish I could say the same for
the young Waiters.
After that we had rather a rum thing. They drunk to the French
Embassador, and, may I never taste Old Port again if he didn't
return thanks in French! I should like to know how many on us
understood him. I didn't for one, and what's more, didn't pretend
to. How many on 'em can say that? Why, to watch 'em, as me
and BROWN did, a grinning and nodding their heads, you'd ha'
thought they all knew what he were talkin' about. Then they
drunk the House of Lords. That 'a the toast for me, especially when
nicely buttered. I riverenoes the House of Lords. I never knowed
a Peer as gave me less than half a crown.

MONSIEUR ROUOOULY, THE FAMOUS BARITONE, SMOKES A QUIET CIGARETTE, ERE HE PLUNGES INTO THE BANDY RIPPLE.
PUNCH'S ESSENCE OF PAELIAMENT.
MONDAY, August 30 (Lordt).—European Concert "all right up to
now," says Lord GRANVILLE. Turkish movement rather too rallen-
tando, perhaps; but it is hoped that the lagging Ottoman will soon
be brought up to time.
Ground-Game Bill. Lord KEDEHDAT.K boldly moves its rejection.
But who recks REDESDALE? Apostate Peers look upon Abdiel as an
old fogey. The Great Educator rises, and posing as Chiron, Nestor,
Ulysses, and Puck—particularly Puck—all in one, addresses the
House on this wise:—
The Bill in bad, bad with aa baneful badnets
As our btloved Abdiel (worthy fossil!)
In his three points hath pictured it; base breach
Of contract-freedom; violation vile
Of immemorial rights of Property;
Shapen to stir up strife 'twist close-knit souls,
The Damon and the Pythias of our day,
Landlord and Tenant. Arrogant as false,
Conciliation none, nor compromise,
Containing. Lo! it turns the lawless poacher,
Land's loathliest enemy, to an "expert,"
A licensed trespasser, who may, o'erbold,
"Stand in the sunshine of the Constitution,"
And Uourish his free weapon in the face
Of Providence and of the Manor's Lord.
Moat horrible! (Shudderi vaibly.) Yet, to reject the Bill,
AB RBDESDALE moves, were—well, were ticklish—ticklish.
Jjignus v indice nodus? Not such knot
Thit knotty question quite. For me, in faith
I have no interest in the subject, none.
Hughenden's hermit, I, calm Cincinnatus,
To cabbage-culture sworn, not any more
A candidate for Parliament, nor like
To rear or tumble Ministries again;
Only the Constitution's humble champion,
And yours, my Lords, and yours! (fatuei, much moved, then
rallying, proceeds.) Peers, 'tis a trap,
This bold bad Bill, baited to snare your pride
And catch your prejudice, and so disarm you
For imminent Constitutional Armageddon!
So, to Committee let it pass, and there
Be purged, pared, picked to pieces, purified,
As your sweet wills and subtle wits decree,
Till 'tis a very Bottom of a Bill-
By much Amendment, as by Ass's head,
Translated, changed, transmogrified. So do,
0 Peers, my ermined brethren; proving thus
That you 're self-sacrificing patriots,
Paladins versed in valour's better part,
And— more considerably up to snuff
Than HEDBSDALB or the Radicals conceive!
And behold the Peers did even as Puck advised, with results that
may perchance be manifest anon.
(Commons.)— The Irish Members kept their word, and did not
considerably "out-run the Constable" in the matter of that Con-
stabulary vote, which was agreed to after due debate.
Then COURTNEY suggested, dc die in diem,
Verbatim Report*! Well, of course they may try 'em;
But Punch would just warn the palavering lot,
That at 8-5, Fleet Street, no rubbish is shot!
The Sitting wound up with Navy Estimates and Ways and Means.
Tuesday (Lords).— Hare-skins I Rabbit-skins ! 1! (See Cartoon.)
Little more left of the Ground-Game Bill when their Lordships had
done with it. Whether Sir W. HARCOUBT, the Commons, or the
Tenant-Farmers will care for the Lords' leavings, is at least open to
doubt.
( Common*.)— The old old Optimist v. Pessimist controversy anent
our Iron-clad Fleet once more resumed between Officialdom and ex-
Officialdom. The upshot, of course, was that nothing could be
than the actual state of affairs, or more
than the
worse alarming
outlook. JOHN BULL pays his money, and may take his choice of
the two views.
Then prolonged palaver about the Dark Continent, the land of
geographical mystery and political muddle. The relations between

CATCHING THE EARLY BIRD. (AUGUST 31.)
Customer (curious to know how Partridges get into "the Market'' so early on
Sept. 1st). "I WANT A BBACE OF PARTRIDGES FOR A SICE RELATIVE."
Poulterer. "CAN'T HAVE 'EM TILL TO-MORROW, SIR."
Customer. "BUT COULDN'T YOU TO-DAY, AS A FAVOUR FOR AN INVALID?
I'LL OIVB FIFTEEN SHILLINGS FOR THEM."
Poulterer. "W-K-LL— (hesitatingly)— IF YOU'LL MAKE IT A GUINEA—(deci-
dedly)—rov SHALL HAVE 'EM!" [Customer departs satisfied.
the Colonists and what we call the Mother Country (but they seem to regard as a
sort of Motherrin-Law Country), are a little strained. South-African settlers,
like South-African sherry, seem to have a fine faculty for disagreeing with
everybody except, perhaps, Sir BARTLE FKERE: and the Home Government
cannot agree with him. It is clear that "England in Africa "is not yet a
satisfactory subject for epic treatment. "Who will be our Scipio Africanus in a
peaceful sense, a worthy successor in policy to LIVINGSTONE in pioneering?
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, on behalf of the Government, avowed the most excellent
intentions in the most exemplary manner. Mr. Punch hopes that something
good may come of it. Burials Bill, back from the Lords, read a Third Time.
Wednesday (Lords).—Chorus of Peevish Peers. Eh? Whatr1 Registration
of Voters (Ireland) Bill? At this time of the Session? Pooh I pooh I altogether
infra dig. Those confounded Commons are coming it quite too strong. Let's
chuck it out, unconsidered, just to show we 're not to be trifled with.
[Do so, by a majority of'12.
(Commons.)— Chorus of exasperated Paddies. Another base and brutal insult
from the Hereditary and Irresponsible Legislators! Revenge!!! Let's oppose
the Appropriation Billl [Do so, and yet further prolong the Session.
Mr. Punch (and the Public}. "A plague on both your Houses!"
Thursday (Lords).—The Ground-Game Bill having been ground down till,
like the Yankee girl's nose, it rather resembles "the little end of nothing
whittled down to a point," is allowed by the Peers to pass, amidst fresh ebulli-
tions of patrician petulance. To doggerelise it :—
Lord VIVIAN regarded all Rabbits as Vermin, and hinted that he such vermin hated;
Lord B.YTEMAN was sick of Hares and Rabbits, »nd -wished they were all exterminated.
Lord FEVERSHAM vowed farmers value these "vermin," forty millions are annually vended.
Then the Lords' little game with the Ground-Game Bill, at least for the moment, was ended.
(Commons.)—Over the Census Bill Honourable Members got senselessly
incensed concerning the " return of religious opinions " question, the champions
of Church and Dissent slang-whanging each other in a style wherein was queerly
blent the fanaticism of the Grand Inquisitor and the foxiness of the smaU
attorney. BRIGHT turned on his tartest tap. You should know better, JOHN.
Noblesse oblige! Let the Olympians keep to their
Nectar, and eschew the sour small beer of petty polemics.
What we want at St. Stephen's is more virility and less
vixenishness—all round. Be men, Messieurs!
Sir Wilfrid Laivson. Ah! Happy Thought! The
Eastern Question! Mustn't finish the Session without a
chat on that novel theme. "What is the Government
doing? Nothing, I trust, or at least nothing that means
anything. But what is all this shocking talk about
"Coercion" and " Naval Pemonstrations?" Methinks
I sniff gunpowder! European Concert all very well so
long as it plays no military music, nor drowns the still
small voice of my soul's idol, Absolute Non-intervention.
Let the Government formally take the pledge of Total
Abstinence (from aught but toast-and-water and talkee-
talkee) before it sends us to our homes.
Lord Hartington, The Naval Demonstration is simply
a demonstration of the unbroken harmony of the Six
Concerted Powers, and of their determination to make
the Turk toe the line. <}. E. D. The Turk is not an
absolute donkey; and I won't insult him by supposing
that he '11 court actual Coercion; but if he (Joes—ahem I
[Not, to be drawn,

rassed us; but, oh! what a lovely mess yon are making
of the whole business!" [ Hugs himself.
Sir H. Wolff. Ditto to Mr. BOUBKE. [Chuckles.
Sir C. Dilke. The Six against Turkey mean peace,
not war, and would preserve the Porte, rather than
pickle it. Conservatives cast cold water on the European
Concert: we trust it to keep Europe out of hot water.
You 'II see I [Subsides into his seat, and a serene smile.
Mr. Punch. I must keep my eye on the lot of you!
[Keeps it.
Friday.—Long Sessions make short tempers I That,
Mr. Punch opines, is the only possible excuse for the
peevish competitive puerilities in which Lords and
Commons to-night indulged. That grave and reverend
Signior, Lord REDESDALE, gave notice of a bogus tu
Smque Resolution reflecting on the Lower House, Mr. T.
'CONNOR, as a retort discourteous, moved to abolish the
official salary of Lord REDESDALE. Mr. FORSTER was
intemperately minatory of the Upper Chamber, Sir S.
NORTHCOTE as intemperately denunciatory of Mr. FORS-
TER. Finally, Mr. CALLAN made an unmitigated Jeru-
salem of himself, and got "named" and suspended.
Fitting climax of childish contentiousness! In the lucid
intervals of shindying insanity, the Lords agreed to most
of the Commons' Amendments to the Burials Bill, and
the Commons to certain of the Lords' Amendments to the
Ground-Game Bill.
Hurroo! Land at last! Prorogation imminent —as
Mr. GLADSTONE would say, " within measurable distance."
Mr. Punch's prophetic (and impatient) soul flies in
advance of the lagging hours, and thus informally dis-
misses lingering Session and long-tried Senators :—
Sty Lords, likewise also ye gents of the Commons,
S'o doubt you're impatiently waiting my summons.
Farewell! get ye gone from my eyes and the House,
jo pop at the partridge, go bang at the grouse.
Having weathered all etorms, use this glorious weather
To breath Autumn's ether, and snift'Autumn's heather.
Forget ills of Ireland on Scotia's hills;
Let your musings, dear boys, be of bags, not of bills.
Be your talk still of sport, not its laws but its pleasures;
if ay your consciences lose the dead weights of dead measures
All work and no play has made JACK a cross boy;
Let him now in relief from long jawing find joy.
Let ELCHO court silence, and HEDESDALE woo peace,
And CHAPLIN and CHURCHILL from chevying cease.
Hay NOKTHCOTB find Firmness, and may HARCOCRT find Tact,
And FORSTER Discretion, and GORST grasp of Fact.
From A. BARTLETT'S bonnet may gales blow the bees,
And WOLFF lose those Bogeys that stupidly tease.
Hay sanity clear DILLON'S much-muddled mental-man,
tfay churl BIGOAR learn to behave like a gentleman,
Hay Commons and Lords get their wits out of tangles,
[.earn manhood and manners and cut boyish wrangles,
[n short get along! Slope! Skedaddle! Clear out!
Though—the QUEEN'S Speech to summarise—you have no doubt,
lad a hot Session's toil, wo will hope that next Season
fou '11 do better work with more temper and reason.
At present relieve House and Town of your presence,
And Punch of the task of extracting more Essence!
DnricuXT THING TO KEEP nr INDIA.—A cool head.

A Card.
A SECTION of the British Association at Swansea was
entertained with a paper on "The Required Amendments
of the Marriage Laws of the United Kingdom," read by
Dr. ACE. If T)r. ACE treated this interesting subject in
a suitable spirit, he has entitled himself to be described
as the ACE of Hearts.
DIAEY OF THE PEEMIER AT SEA.
THURSDAY.—On board the Grantully Castle. Thousands assem-
bled on Pier at Gravesend—wanted me to make speech. Had to
say (by Doctor's orders), "Very sorry, couldn't oblige them, unac-
mstomed to public speaking," &c. Assembled thousands disap-
pointed. I can see them now, however, consoling themselves by
tearing old labels from my luggage, which lies on Pier, as slight
mementoes of my visit.
Half-an-Hour later.—Have just stepped down into cabin. Luxu-
rious furniture, sofas, &c. A writing-table I Sat down at once,
nrrote six post-cards, also letters to BISMARCK, SULTAN, AMEER, and
)thers; also articles on Homeric Ships; and was beginning my Life
>f Lord B d, when Doctor came in, and said, "Must not exert
brain."
Hour later.—Luggage come on board. Boat seen approaching
frith Mayor and an Address, also Deputation and Address from
Liberal Association. By Doctor's advice we steer away. I attempt
io make slight speech to Liberal Deputation through speaking-
irumpet, but stopped by Doctor. Wish I 'd learnt the dumb alpha-
bet. Will do so.
Evening.—Just passed the Nore. Deputation and Address from
keeper of the light-ship.
10 P.M.—Time to "turn in." Do so. Think of HAETTNGTON.
Wouldn't he be glad to be able to "turn in " now!
Friday, 4 A.M.—Went on deck. Ordered back to bed by Doctor.
Sowever, when he left cabin, lit candle, wrote sixteen post-cards.
Knock at door. Captain, Mr. DONALD CURSIE, Doctor, my family,
leveral M.P.'s, most of the crew, and the man at the wheel, outside,
imploring me to husband my strength. Why "husband"? Why not
;l wife" i Note for pamphlet on Mixed Marriages or Husbandry.
8 A.M.—Go on deck. Deputation and Address from occupants of
passing fishing-boat. Gratifying; but causes delay. Jib, spanker,
md topgallant flying, I think. (Mem.—Write Work on Navigation
Ms evening.)
10 A.M.—Have just discovered that man at wheel is a Tory. Very
distressing. And I mayn't speak to him. Doctor's orders to me;
captain's orders to him. Gave him a few copies of Midlothian
speeches. He wants to know where Midlothian is. Query—Does
this bring question of disfranchising man at wheel within the sphere
of practical politics?
12 Noon.—" I stood on bridge at mid-day." (Not " midnight," as
LONGFELLOW says. N.B.—Post-card to LONGFELLOW to-night, cor-
recting his error.)
Weymouth.— Grantully Castle surrounded with boats. Thousands
of bathing-machine women, and children with spades, cheering on
beach. Deputation and Address from local Liberals. Beg me to
come on shore, lay foundation-stone of new Liberal Club, tell them
last reports from Afghanistan, make political speech, but, above all,
to husband my strength. Note.—Is not an "h " omitted in Whey-
mouth? Write article for Magazine on this and on Cowes.
Off Portland.—Inhabitants of whole South of England collected
on Portland Bill. They wave handkerchiefs, and ask for speech. I
explain principle of Hares and Rabbits Bill through, speaking-
trumpet. Doctor begs me to stop.
Plymouth.— Tory stronghold. Inhabitants all assemble, and cheer.
Query—Reaction? Deputation and Address from local Anti-Vac-
cinates. Doctor very angry. I retire to cabin. Hear of all-night
Sitting in House of Commons! Would that I were there 1 I try to
escape to London by one of the boats returning to shore. Caught by
Doctor. Forced to stay. Very provoking. Next time must travel
with a box of disguises. Made up as B d I might escape notice.
Telegrams to HAHTINGTON, FOBSTER, DILKE, &c. Propose to Cap-
tain to invite Messrs. BIGGAR, PARNELL, SULLIVAN, &c., to acoom-
Fany us on voyage. Captain objects—fears disturbance on board,
tell him he shall have compensation for any disturbance. He
asks, "What compensation?" I reply, he to pay £100 to each
Home-Ruler. Strange, he doesn't see where the compensation comes
in exactly.

become of Charybdis? What is the Scotch song about "Scylla

Private and Confidential. Souse of Co *
And now, my dear Sir, a word in justice to myself. I was silent last week. This
needs no excuse, as you know my hints on sporting matters are only to be occasional. But
1 know that quite a different interpretation has been placed upon my absence from your
columns. I am perfectly well aware that the following story is "going the rounds."
I am accused (in spite of my well-known dislike to unnecessary writing) of having forged
the name of the widow of my uncle to a bill of exchange for a considerable sum! Having
done this, it is actually asserted that I discounted the document at a sacrifice of eighty
per cent.—thus realising only afifth ofthe marketable value of the security! This unbusiness-
like conduct (it is so like me to be unbusiness-like!) it is pretended was followed by a whole-
sale seizure and realisation of some Stocks I happened to be holding in trust for two little
orphans of tender years. They say this of me when they know that I perfectly doat upon
children, and am always playing with them! It is further reported that after holding the
flate at a church-door, I decamped with the proceeds before the, conclusion of the sermon!
did leave early, but simply because I was carried away by my feelings.
It is declared, too, and apparently on most trustworthy authnrity, that I have managed to
rob a Bank when all the world was slumbering! Tet I am always in bed by eleven, except
when absolutely prevented by some pressing engagement! However, let that pass. I proceed
with the other events in the indictment. The Police pretend to believe (so I have been
told by a Magistrate I met on the Bench the other day) that I, as Treasurer of the Poor
Widows' Crust of Bread Fund, the Sunday Scholars' Bank, and other equally meritorious
institutions, have used the Voluntary (I lay a stress upon the word "Voluntary ") Contribu-
tions to me in my official character for my own personal maintenance! Is this not really
sad? How few understand the real meaning of the proverb, "Charity begins at home!"
Why continue the long list of my alleged peccadilloes? Sir, in the most solemn manner
in the world, with the utmost impressiveness, I declare that the whole story has been
considerably exaggerated.'

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

THE CRY OF THE CLERK!
HT do they talk of the Border-Land, the
rippling streams and miles of heather,
To one who, scribbling, pen in hand, can
scarce keep body and soul together?
My border-land's twixt life and death, and
I long for the hum of the Underground
To take me away from the roar of the street,
the City's crash, and eternal sound_
That rings in my ears from morn to night,
from the dawn to the dews, from the
light to the dark.
Why do they open their ears to sorrow, and
close them fast to the Cry of the Clerk?
Envious f No! Let them visit the sea,
neither pain nor pleasure are far to seek,
But seas and summers are not for me with
a salary under a pound a week.
My only change is from desk to home, my
only trip on the tramway cars;
My baby's face is my only moon; and the
eyes of my wife are my only stars.
The rocks I climb are tpe paving-stones,
and the Milkman's voice is the morning
lark
That wakes me out of my Itott of dreams,
—where I journey at times, though a
penniless Clerk!
Twenty odd years I have sat at the desk, in the same little den in the same old court, 1
Profitjand loss I.have balanced them up, the firm seemed richer when bread was short.
Drones and bees in the same glass-hive; but they looked on as I made the honey,
But it did seem hard they should waste so much, when I could have cringed tor a loan of
money
To save my sick, to bury my dead, to bring to haven the buffetted bark
That threatened to split on the sands of Time with the life and love of the threadbare Clerk!
I don't growl at the working-man, be his virtue strict or morality lax;
He 'd strike if they gave him my weekly wage, and they never ask him for the Income-tax!
They take his little ones out to tea in a curtained van when the fields are green,
But never a flower, or field or fern in their leafy homes have my children seen.
The case is different, so they say, for I 'm respectable,—save the mark!
He works with the sweat of his manly brow, and I with my body and brain—poor Clerk!
Respectability! That's the word that makes such fellows as I grow lean,
That sends my neighbours to Margate Pier, and sets me longing for Kensal Green!
What in the world is a slave to do, whose ink-stained pen is his only crutch,
Who counts the gain that staggers his brain, and fingers the till that he dare not touch I
Where's the ambition, the hope, the pride of a man like me who has wrecked the Ark
That holds his holiest gifts, and why r Because he is honest and called a Clerk!
Why did I marry? In mercy's name, in the form of my brother was I not born?
Are wife and child to be given to him, and love to be taken from me with scorn?
It is not for them that I plead, for theirs are the only voices that break my sorrow,
That lighten my pathway, make me pause 'twixt the sad to-day and the grim to-morrow.
The Sun and the Sea are not given to me, nor joys like yours as you flit together
Away to the woods and the downs, and over the endless acres of purple heather.
But I 've love, thank Heaven! and mercy, too; 'tis for justice only I bid you hark
To the tale of a penniless man like me—to the wounded cry of a London Clerk!
CRICKET EXTRAORDINARY.
WE don't know much about Cricket—off the hearth; but we fancy that this report, from
the Daily Telegraph, of the Yorkshire and M.C.C. match is a startler:—
"The M.C.C. had 134 to get to win, but on going in they made a disastrous start against the bowling
of I'F.ATK and BATES. Before a run had been scored, Mr. WALKBR was bowled for 8. BARNES was
sent back, and at 11 Mr. STEEL was caught behind the bowler. Mr. STUDD was caught at short leg,
MIDWINTER was caught at slip, and FLOTVERS run out."
Before a run had been scored Mr. WALKED was bowled for eight. Where was the scorer?
Asleep? Or didn't WALKER run? Or is it all a beautiful dream? As we began by
remarking, we do not know much about Cricket; but we cannot refrain from remarking
on the evidently cowardly conduct of Mr. STEEL, who "was caught behind the bowler.
Why did he hide behind the bowler? Why didn't he stay and face the ball like a manP
We shouldn't have done so, we admit; but then we shouldn't have put ourselves forward in
so conspicuous a manner. But to get behind the bowler, and be caught there!—Bah!
It's un-English.
M.C.C. v. Hampshire.—The M.C.C., in their match last week against a Rural District,
produced a rural Eleven, which included a Wood, a Hill, a Park, a Green, a Bird, a Wild, a
Long, and a West.

RECONSTRUCTION.
THE City Press is right in saying—
"The reconstruction of the Central Criminal
Court is just one of those matters which should
by no means be delayed a moment longer than
can possibly be helped. . . . The visit which we
ventured to recommend the members of the Com-
mittee to pay, when the business of the Old Bailey
is in full swing, would enlighten them upon the
many points it is desirable should be taken into
consideration in the work they are about to un-
dertake with the sanction of the Corporation."
The " business of the Old Bailey in full
swing" is unpleasantly suggestive. But
the subject, like the Court, snould be tho-
roughly ventilated. And, a propos, as we
have New Law Courts, why not furnish
them with a few new Laws? For the pre-
sent, as suggested, let the Committee visit
the Old Bailey while the business is "in
full swing," and in order not to decide hur-
riedly, let them suspend their judgment.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAEI.

ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
At the Westminster Aquarium.
HEN the large Establishment
opposite the Abbey, and within
hail of the Houses of Parlia-
ment, was opened to the public,
the more earnest of Mankind
believed that the prospects of
Science, Art, and Literature,
were brightening. In the
address presented to a Prince
of the Blood at the inaugural
ceremony, pointed allusion
•was made to the fact that
ALBEBT THE GOOD had left
at his lamented decease many
schemes for the regeneration
of the World in general and
the British Nation in particu-
lar, in an unfinished state. It
was suggested that certain Philanthropists, bound together by the
magic brotherhood of the Limited Liability Act, had taken this very
much to heart, and that they had determined, through the agency of
a Summer and "Winter Garden, and a Receptacle for Unusual Fish,
to set everything right. In a word, what the PHDTCE CONSOBT
had commenced, was to be finished by the Directors of the West-
minster Aquarium. A first step towards the Millennium was made
by the election of all the Birth, Wealth, and Talent of England to
the distinguished post of " Honorary Fellow." It was generally
understood that the body thus constituted was to act as a sort of
Collective Guardian Angel to the Institution. Since then the walls
of London have told occasionally of the progress of the good work.
At one time the hoardings were covered with a very remarkable
woodcut representing an apparently inoffensive young lady in a
bathing costume, in the act of being blown from the mouth of a
six-thousand-ana-eighty-nine-ton gun, to the evident delight of a
crowd of well-dressed loungers. And at this very moment the public
are being earnestly invited through the same agency to gaze upon
another young lady in another bathing costume, as she, with pink
boots, holds high revel over some buns and a cup of tea on her back
in a tank. But as the exception proves the rule, these little eccen-
tricities of management might inferentially denote that the great
scheme of national improvement, in the sternest sense of the words,
was progressing satisfactorily. I determined to judge for myself,
and expend a shilling—or more.
Before entering, I glanced at the placards on the walls. I par-
ticularly noticed three pictures. One represented an enormous
gorilla, presumably about eighty feet high, as he seemed to be
resting in a forest, with his hand clutching the tree-tops. The next
depicted a desperate battle waged by a select band of graceful but
bloodthirsty savages. The last was a little perplexing—it was a
strange group labelled, "Comic Military Band twice dailv." Per-
plexing, I repeat, from a Millennium point of view. The _ battle
and the gorilla sketches might have had some connection with the
Darwinian theory and the Survival of the Fittest.
Glancing sorrowfully at a couple of melancholy seals in a bath, and
courteously refusing to buy a magic pen-wiper, or some equally use-
ful article of a young female, who, although personally a stranger
to me, addressed me in a manner suggesting that she had known me
intimately all my life, and longer, I approached the Grand Marquee.
This I heard was the home of r' Ourang, the Old Man of the Woods,"
whose pictorial acquaintance I had already made in the sketch of the
gorilla. I paid another fee (the second), and found myself in a red
and white tent, nearly entirely occupied by the basin of an unused
fountain. In a corner was a cage, and in the cage was a wretched
looking monkey (seemingly rather larger than a good sized cat)
clinging listlessly to the top bars of his prison. This was " Ourang."
The creature gazed at me Badly, having probably satisfied himself
that I had not come in with an "order." His expression said
plainly, "Poor idiot! you have paid an extra shilling to see me!"
Then he yawned. I couldn't nelp asking with Dick Swireller's
friend in the Old Curiosity Shop, "Is the Old Man friendly?"
The Old Man was friendly, but bored. Finding that "Ourang"
seemed anxious to shun observation, I turned my eyes away, and
consequently came face to face with the following " notice : "—
"Visitors are most particularly requester! not to give the animal
food of any description. The greatest care has to be exercised in
choosing its diet."
This would have excited my curiosity had I not seen on the ledge
of the case a collection of comestibles that were apparently being
reserved for "the Old Man's" dinner. The collection consisted of three
halves of lemons, a small brush (such as is used for blacking boots)
and some sawdust. Having made this discovery, I thought it time

to take my leave. As I departed, I observed that "the Old Man" was
seemingly attempting to break the tedium of his confinement by
peeping through a hole in his tent at the half-suppressed grimaces
of a solemn-looking Gentleman in evening dress, who was busily
employed on the stage of the Institution in giving a spirited render-
ing of the characteristic sounds of a country farm-yard. I was glad
to notice this, as it seemed to attract Ourang's attention for a moment
from the evidently startling performances of the Industrious Fleas,
who, although advertised to appear in another part of the building,
had certainly chosen "the Old Man" himself as a platform for a
portion of their little entertainment.
I now followed the sound of some hideous shouts to their source—
a room in the gallery. For a third time I paid a shilling. _ On
entering the apartment, a
youth was saying " They
will now 'unt. They will
'unt their prey ana sur-
round it. When they 'ave
'unted it they will sing
their song of joy." Upon
this seven Zulus, in Afri-
can costumes that I cannot
help fancying must have
received some important
additions from a miscella-
neous collection of articles
of British manufacture,
began to jump about and
yell in a manner suggestive
of an impromptu charade
got up by schoolboys quite dt-void of dramatic talent. Such a hunt!
— or to adopt the evident Zulu pronunciation, such "an 'unt!'
After a few more Colney-Hatch performances they began to shake
hands with the spectators, with the immediate result of clearing the
room. I lagged behind, having noticed a certain sameness in the
Entertainment (which I had only partly witnessed), and asked if
what I had seen differed materially from what I had not f The
youth, a most courteous young gentleman, explained to me that,
"he thought the words of their songs was different!"
Did the exigences of space permit, I would report in detail how
I paid a fourth shilling to see CHANG, sixpence to visit my valued
friend, the Chess Automa-
ton from, I think, the
Crystal Palace (business
was shirk, and there was
a slight delay in my ad-
mission, rather suggestive
of the Automaton and the
Lecturer having a friendly
chat together in their
shirt-sleeves during the
pauses between the per-
formances), and three-
pence to gaze into a glass
which increased my natu-
rally graceful proportions
to a condition of revolting
obesity. I was lured into
this] last exhibition by Being a placard bearing the inscription,
"Roars of laughter! See yourself as others see you!" I, so far
from being amused, was very angry, and nearly knocked the at-
tendant's (a small boy's) head off! As for the Giants, I could learn
nothing about them, as "the full descriptive lecture at 3'30" was
not delivered. What there is in my personal appearance to
induce everyone to pester me to buy photographs as touching
mementoes of my visit, I don't know. But so it was.
It remains but to say that, as I left, a talented gentleman, in yellow
satin trowsers, was balancing a quart bottle on his nose, or perform-
ing some other dangerous feat of an equally intricate character on
the stage, to the languid satisfaction of a group of well-dressed
visitors of both sexes. I attended the place in the afternoon. In
the evening I understand, there are many attractions, chiefly due to
the marvellous magisterial licensing system of the period. In spite,
however, of this encouraging fact, I fear, when I consider the lofty
objects aimed at by the original Directors, I cannot honestly declare
that the Millennium has commenced at the Royal Westminster
Aquarium—just at present.

PAH is the name of a new weekly
satirical journal to appear on the 25th

illustrated, by Mr. ALFRED THOMP-
SON. Satirically, of course it will
be a frying-pan and a warming-pan;
and;" I '11 warm yon !" ought to be
an appropriate legend under an illus-
tration of that sort of Pan. But is
it called after the great god, Pan, and
to be a sort of Satyr-day Review f or
is it pan the greek, as every school-
boy knows — except the one we 've
been educating ourselves—for "every-
thing"? If Pan means everything,
we trust he '11 do something, and
that something well. The popular
"G. A. S." is to be a main contri-
butor, which will insure the bril-
liancy of the Light articles.

AGONY-POINT AMUSEMENTS.
THAT Humanity might be human hut for its amusements may soon
become an aphorism fit to pair off with Sir G. C. LEWIS'S celebrated
proverbial paradox. Perhaps were it frankly advertised that a young
girl was about to ruin her health in public for pay, or openly submit
to the pangs of the rack for so many hours at the Royal Aquarium,
some shock might be experienced even by sensation-hardened plea-
sure seekers, some inquiry made as to the power of the law and the
responsibility of parents. That would be brutal and brutalising
torture of course. Miss BECKWITH'S sponsors have only undertaken
that she shall attempt to remain in a tank of water exposed to general
view for one hundred consecutive hours. That is public amusement!
True the poor child—she is little more—recently tried a much shorter
swim, and broke down, sick and suffering. People praised her
"pluck" then; they will now reward her success, or solace her
failure with the same cheap tribute of selfish folly. Pluck is a good
thing. But displayed by a young girl in the form of prolonged
endurance of purposeless suffering, in the interest, presumably of
greedy relatives and callous betting men, it loses its charm, if not
its credit.
A swim of a hundred hours is as objectless as it is penitential, as
ungraceful as it is degrading. Exhibitions of prowess, skill, elegant
deftness, even of cool nerve and not too agonising endurance, are
legitimate enough when voluntarily undertaken by competent and
responsible agents. But a girl of eighteen floundering in a tank for
four days and nights at a stretch, probably doing irretrievable
damage to her constitution, at the bidding of "friends," and for
the morbid gratification of stupid gazers, is, we protest, an exhi-
bition as ungraceful in itself as it is disgraceful to the parents
who instigate it, the law that permits it and the public that patro-
nises it.

6. Because you are close to the

8. Because the Doctor is next

Because last year was a good

Because the season began early,

Because you are nicely shel-

Because you are some way from

Because you are not near the
hotel, and so escape the noisy
young men leaving it at
nights.
Because the Church is a nice
distance off. and you are not
roused by the bells.
Because you are quiet and re-
tired, away from the street*

Because, though within easy
reach of a medical man, he ia
not under your very nose,
which is of course unpleasant,
as if you were going to be an

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
QUITE A LITTLE HOLIDAY.
(Notes by Wandering Willie.)
September.—Get my route for Brussels. (Note for Joke-book, or joke for
Note-book—"Root" for Brussels. Result, "Sprouts." Think it out as I go
along.) Having got it, the question arises, Which am I to take P Meeting
little fur RAYLE in the street, he at once suggests accompanying him on
board his yacht. Good. Done.
Odd that until now I should always have associated yachting with the pos-
session of great wealth and high rank. Now, RAYLE is one of those men reputed
to possess £500 a-year of his own, and, though a barrister, very little of any body
else's. His legal career began, and, as far as I know, ended with the defence
of an old lady charged with picking pockets, who, on being sentenced to seven
years' penal servitude—about fourteen times the ordinary sentence—threw a
boot at her advocate. Mentioning this generally to little PITCHES at the Club,
he tells me that everybody hires someone else's. That seems complicated.
"But," he explains, "they share the expense." TAFF R VYI.K didn't ask me to
share any expense. Must be careful to behave as a guest. No, I don't like this
idea at all, and am thinking of crying off when I run against RAYLB again; and
it comes out, in the course of conversation, that he has had his present skipper
four years, that his yacht is named the Dora, and that she is a thirty-tonner.
A thirty-ton yacht! It is curious what little that conveys to me. The Dora
may be anything between the Great Eastern and a canoe, for all I know.
What is a ton? Well, one orders coals by the ton, but beyond the fact that
they last an uncommonly short time, my knowledge of tonnage there ceases.
Stay! I once heard a man in the Guards say that so many of his men went
to the ton, and But who said it, and where he is now, I don't know.
Now to find out what a ton is. Ha! Here at the Club is the very man,
MULTIPLE, M.P. for Numbers, a man that has tackled GLADSTONE himself on his
Estimates, and has sent several Secretaries for India to untimely graves through
his masterly exposure of their Budgets. I will get all information as to what a
ton is from him. //-• doesn't know. Sir 11 on ION KIRBY still in town. As he
has got a " ton " in his name, he ought to know. (Query.—Would he like me
to make a joke about his name? Better ask him first, and see if he's likely
to take it good-naturedly.) He is off before I have made up my mind whether
to give him my joke on his name or not. It will keep till I see him again.
Sept. 10th.—The day at last. Up with the lark—that is, a decent, sensible
lark—and don my yachting costume. A fisherman's cap, which gives me quite
the appearance of Masaniello; a jersey, with "Dora" in red letters, and
"R. T. Y. C." beneath.
Charing Cross Station! Here are TAFF Km.!: and his friends who are
going with us. He introduces us in such an offhand manner that we have to
find out who we are afterwards from one another quietly and in corners. At
present, all I can ascertain is, that one is BOB and the other is BEN.
In the carriage. UK.N is a cheery little man, with the Racing Calendar
and all the Sporting Papers. He asks me what will win the Ebor Handicap.
Now, I only know the name of one horse of whom I am perfectly certain
he is living, so make answer, "Bend Or." He laughs heartily, and says I
evidently know a thin^" or two. Perhaps I do, perhaps I have been knowing a
thing or two all my Me without being aware of it. Emboldened by my first
success, I ask him what will win the Cesare-
witoh, a name 1 get out diffidently, not quite
certain whether it hasn't been run already.
He wants to know how he is to know till the
weights are out. This throws a new light upon
my knowledge of horse-racing, and I medita-
tively answer, "Which also holds good about
the St. Leger." At this he roars, and says I
am a warm member. "My wig I Shouldn't I
like to go printing with you! Shouldn't we
stand on velvet! No weighing in accounts for
you, but also touching, eh '< We must go to
Newmarket together. You are a warm "un."
All this is said in such evident tones of admi-
ration, that though I have no idea of what he
seeks to convey, I cannot take offence. I cer-
tainly am a " warm 'un," but this is natural in
such September weather. BEN says, "Yes, it
is very natural." Good fellow, BKN.
BOB, it appears, is a great authority on cricket.
He attends every match in London, and can repeat the county scores of the
season off by heart. He wants to know how 1 would constitute an English
team to play the Australians. I suggest that Nottingham man, CLAKKB.
He laughs and winks, and says perhaps I am right, and that we 'd better not
engender ill-feeling, and adds that I evidently know my way about.
I subsequently discover that CLAHKB has been dead for several years.
Did BOB know it F Think not. If so, I 've impressed him. The Yacht. We 're
off. 1 have pictured the deck of a yacht with sailors in red caps splicing things
for'ard. I recline astern, on a tiger skin. By me sits, in irreproachable
costume, an 18-carat golden-hairecl beauty. She passes over to me some cup,
looking on me caressingly the while, as I, daintily taking a cigarette from
my mouth, utter some pretty conceit. On the Pier, someone, gazing in envy,
remarks, "That's a lucky man with that fine yacht and that lovely girl."
To which his friend responds, "Trust a Swell to enjoy himself. Don't we
pay taxes for him?" EBITH.
This suggest! what I may tnter

ionian illustration of

That to-morrow I 'd marry—a Turk,

BUMBLEDOM ON ITS DEFENCE.
(To the Editor of Punch.)
As a Middlesex Magistrate, I am much pained by the
remarks in your last number about the Licensing System.
I consider that system perfect—absolutely perfect. I
tremble to think what would become of the four millions
of helpless—not to say brutal—creatures in London, if
they were not strictly ruled on what I may call Clapton
and Stoke Newington principles. We have two duties
to perform, and we perform them without flinching.
We are Trustees, so to speak, for the great Gin-and-
Beer-producing Interest, and we have to see that nothing
is granted to the hundred thousand pot-houses (more
or less) within our jurisdiction which would interfere
in the least with the sale of drink. Music and dancing,
together or separate, we venture to think would so in-
terfere with tils sale; and for this reason (if for no other)
we should deal out music and dancing licences as spar-
ingly as possible.
Apart from this, however, according to strict Clapton
and Stoke Newington principles, we look upon music as
an error, and dancing as a crime. We treat any man
who dares to apply to us for the simple licence for music
as a lost sinner; and if he applies for the compound
licence (music and dancing), we regard him as a hardened
offender.
It is nothing to tell us, as we have been told by a
Parliamentary Committee, that we are dealing with two-
thirds of the "places of amusement" in London, and
with property that may be valued at more than a million
sterling. Our mission is to put down amusement and to
uphold drinking—simple, unalloyed, and steady drink-
ing. We care nothing for public opinion, and even lese
for the Press. Our body is strong in numbers, and
stronger in prejudices. If we happen to have a few
misguided Liberals in our phalanx of Six Hundred, the
men of sound Clapton and Stoke Newine-ton principles
are strong enough to over-rule them. W» are the men
who are always present, who know our own minds, who
have a compact cut-and-dried policy. We rule the
Bench, and through the Bench we rule this miserable
Metropolis.
It is our firm conviction that if ancient Babylon hac
been blessed with a body of gentlemen like ourselves, i
would still have been a thriving if not a very cheerfu
city.

subject in all its Berens.
THE BEST AUSTRALIAN MEET.—The gathering of th
Eleven at Kennington Oval.
NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
I WAS sent for all in a hurry last week to attend the Minister's White Bait
)inner at Greenwich. They allers has the same waiters because they know w£
an be trusted. We used to be sworn to secrecy on the menu*, out that's
one away with. I've heard of quite fabbilus prices being offered by Gents of
he Press to be pummitted to attend as waiters, but it's reelly somethink ridik-
lus, as if a meer Riporter could be a Waiter, without a propper eddicashun.
Veil, of course, I 'm not a-going to betray any secrets, or any of the importent
>its of informashun as I heerd1, but there's a few little thinks as I 'm quite at
iburty to menshun. Ah.what a mistake it was of the old Liberal Government
a give up their Animul Dinner once a year! I allers knows there's something
wrong when a Gent doesn't care about his dinner. And so it turned out, and
heywas turned out, not at all to the regret of Livury Cumpiniss and Waiters.
Well the fust thing as struck me wa* to see young Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, why
_e didn't look above 25, but lor bless yer, he held his own with the best on 'em.
and to watch him dressed as if heM just amerged from a ban-box, you'd
hiuk he'd bin in a Cabinet all his life. Mr. BRIGHT were pressunt; and
..here were a rore all round when he were arst if he 'd have sum more, and
le says, "Suttingly, I like a big peace." Sir W. HARCOTJBT was the life and sole
of the Party, as I'm told he is everywhere. Oh didn't he send the chaff flying
about, and yet never forgot his propper Dignity. How some men are lost to
he World! To think that such a man should only be a mere Sekriterry, and
,hen to think what a Lord Mare he 'd a made! Another instance of the wrong
man in the right place. They all seemed a little afraid of Sir HENRY JAMES, and
no wunder, wny his wit seemed as bright and as sharp as a new carving knife.
"These mushrooms is very small, Waiter," said Mr. FORSTEB to me. This
one's biggar" said I, pointing to a large one. "I wish it wos," says he,
sending his fork into it so fiercely as almost to upset the lot.
I think I never heerd more purer charrytubble sentiments than was egs-
>rest about the Home-Rulers. It were a uncommon plessunt party, tho' as I
vere takin' a 'oliday, miksin pleeshur with bisniss, by elpin a frend at Margit
to be sumund to Grmidge was ruff on me. (Signed) ROBERT.
HOLIDAY "HAUNTS."
(At Cheddar.)
How grandly rise these mighty piles of'rocks,
Where Nature's hand Man s puny efforts mocks;
Here all may read what my whole frame is thrilling—
"Plain teas are ninepence, or with «ggs a shilling.
See how the valley winds its way between
The beetling cliffs, so sweetly specked with green.
No sound to break the spell—all seems forsaken—
"A nice day, Sir, to have your portrait taken."
0, sweet it is 'midst scenes like these to wander,
And o'er great Nature's handiwork to ponder;
Here, far remote from Cockney cries, I'11 tarry—
"I 'm blest if this here don't beat 'Ampstead, 'ABRT I'
ANYTHING MORE?
THIS recently appeared in a daily paper :—
GOVERNESS.—WANTED, a Young Lady as Governess to three children (go«d
English education only required), and occasionally to wait at table and attend upon
parties of the highest respectability. Must have a knowledge of cooking, and be willing
to make herself generally useful as mother's help. A servant u kept. Will be a good
home for many years. Character u to honesty and suitability indispensable. Apply,
stating age and salary required, &o.
And, alas! how many applications will there be in answer to this Advertise-
ment. But why keep a servant at all? Perhaps after a while, if the Governess
suits, the servant will be dispensed with as a mere luxury.
Currie-ous Definition.
A FEW days ago two Italian Organ-grinders were charged at the Hammer-
smith Police Court with annoying the inhabitants of Notting Hill. Their defence
was that a Mr. CTTRBIE, one of the householders, encouraged their playing
"because he was fond of music." It seems, however, that this eccentric indi-
vidual " appeared to be deaf." The two Grinders were drawn for ten shillings
a piece. The Magistrate suggested that Mr. CURME ought to pay the money
That made it hot even for CITBBIE. Apparently hardness of hearing is not
taken as an excuse, and it is a satisfaction to know that a deaf man who
encourages organ-grinding can, by a Magistrate, be deaf-fined as a nuisance.
Dot-in His Eye.
Mr. TOOLE announces that at a matinee, Dot will be revived I Poor Dot! I
she to be revived for this once only? If so, it sounds likely to be a lame affair
or a Dot-and-go-one matinfe performance. It ought to do more than that,

COMB! gather round, and I '11 tell you a story—
Strange it may sound in material days.
War is the theme, and its issue is glory,—
Silly old troubadours jingled such lays.
What is the name of my hero? Writ plain,
Soldier, and Scotchman, it's HECTOB MACLAINE!
HECTOR sounds well in a story of battle.
lion KK had some such old hero in Troy.
Schoolboys may doubt; but the roar and the rattle,
Cannon and smoke—that's the school of the boy.
Woolwich Cadet! oh I so cruelly slain:
Why did they leave yon, young HECTOB MACLAINK?
Leave you, my lad? When your "pals" all adored you.
Was there one comrade refused you his life P
War is full dear; but we could not afford you,
Tou who rejoiced in the drum and the fife.
Ours is the loss, hut to fame is the gain:
Why did they kill you, young HECTOR MACLAINE?
Kill'd you a prisoner! Left there, and lonely,
Waiting in hope for the grasp of our hand.
Straining your ears for pur cheering, and only
Living to leap at the lilt of your band 1
Curs'd be the murderers 1 Children of Cain,
Those who betsay'd you, our HECTOR MACLAINB I
How our hearts beat when we thought we could save you;
We were so cheery, and you, boy. so far.
Unfurl the colours 1 We thought they could wave you
Hope from the lads to the far Candanar!
Strike up the pipes I for we '11 at him again:
ROBKBTS is marching to HECTOR MACLAJNE I
Merciless fate! When the Highlanders started,
Firm in their purpose to rescue a friend,
Out from the ambush the enemy darted,
Called the last roll, stabb'd,—and that was the end!
Just as we breasted the hill from the plain,
Died, like a soldier, young HECTOR MACLAINE!
Died? Why, of course, he met death like a hero,
Baring his breast whilst the prisoners fled.
He was the victim, his gaoler the Nero,
Filing his body on heaps of the dead.
Still, ere you fell, and were mixed with the slain,
Scotland was true to you—HECTOR MACLAINE!
MUDFORDBURY IMPROVEMENTS. (P)
WHILE Mud-Salad Market glories and thrives in its filth, about
five or six acres of land have oeen cleared in its immediate neigh-
bourhood, and not a whisper is heard that one yard of this ground
is to be devoted to the improvement of this metropolitan nuisance.
The east side of Mudfordbury and other property has been pulled
down, about 150 houses have been cleared away on the east side of
Dreary Lane, and the papers inform us that these " extensive areas
are now being built upon." How built upon P Warehouses, "resi-
dential chambers," the usual number of pot-houses, of course, and
everything instead of supplementary markets, are doubtless in course
of formation, but not"a sign of even an extra dust-hole for the Ducal
refuse. Three-and-Thirty Millions a year are collected and spent
by our Local Rulers—to say nothing of our Eighty Millions of Impe-
rial Taxation—and yet the centre of London is still a wilderness of
rotten vegetable matter.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ENGLAND V. AUSTRALIA.
A Lay of Kennington Oval and the Great Cricket Match,
September 6th, 1th, and Sth, 1880.

I SING not of the tented field, but of the grassy sward,
Where England's champions, flannel-clad, brown-browed, of shoulders broad,
Met in fair fray, on an Autumn day, eleven stout and true,
From the far-off land of tinned meats and the bounding kangaroo.
All omens favourably smiled, for e'en the Weather's Clerk
Forbore to play on this great day his usual pluvial lark;
The sun shone fair on wickets rare, while cloudlets in the blue,
High o'er the huge gasometers, like Peace's ensigns flew.
Only one sorrow smote those souls, who longed for " all things fair,"
SPOFFOBTH'S swift balls should smite no sticks—the " Demon" was not there;
But MURDOCH, like King HABRY, scorned in heart or hope to fail,
SPOFFOBTH, like PEECT, was but one, and this team had ne'er a " tail."
Then up stood stalwart W. GRACE, and up stood stout E.M.,
Right well they knew that England's hopes hung largely mpon them;
The Champion flashed his dusk slant eye right warily around,
The Doctor braced his shoulders, and with light foot beat the ground.
A hit! A hit I A single! So! Steady, Sirs! Keep straight bats!
For close around the fielders crouch, lynx-eyed, alert as cats.
BLACKHAM at wicket, SLIGHT at point, test nerves of steadiest stuff,
And think not if ye sky or spoon that GKOUBE or MOULE will muff.
How's that? A shout I The Doctor's out, those brothers stout must part,
But LUCAS see, the great A. P., old Surrey's champion smart!
These ready two the strife renew, and "play" and "hit" as though
They meant to stay till Michaelmas Day, or slog till the time of snow.
But LUCAS piles and passes off, young BARNES he comes and goes,
And still Leviathan slogs and slogs, still grows his score, and grows;
Till having summed his One-Five-Two, at length his sure eye fails,
And PALMER'S ball his off stump takes, one inch below the bails.
Oh never sure rang louder cheer from round the tourney's ring,
Than greeted him the long of limb, swart-bearded, swift of spring;
And never more did knight rejoice who foe from saddle bore,
Than MURDOCH'S men to end at last the Champion's spanking score.
Time fails to tell how long and well scarce lesser heroes fought,
How HARHIS drove, STEXL cut, MOULE stopped, and ALEXANDER caught,
Till, their time come, the English team could slog and swipe no more,
And the lot were out, 'midst a mighty shout for Four Hundred plus one score!
Nor boots it tell what a crooked spell of Cricketer's cross-luck
Had MURDOCH'S men from the moment when their Captain " made his duck;"
Of the follow-on when hope seemed gone, to all save MURDOCH stout,
But he took to hitting like any ten, and they could not get him out!
In vain deft MORLET hurled his fast left-handers in,
in vain
STEEL'S swiftest, GRACE'S straightest ones down on his
bat did rain;
Though round him fast his fellows fell, sore-hurt yet
linn stood he,
Hour after hour, till he raised the score to the figures
One-Five-Three!
One point above great GRACE'S pile; nor beaten then
by ball,
Midst one huge shout, first in, not out, top scorer of
them all,
To tent he went. Then the Britons, fagged, to the
wicket once more passed,
And it cost them sir good batsmen more to win the
match at last!
For many a year, in many a tent, on many a Cricket-
ground,
Whilst the Hatfield beads in the brimming jug as the
Shandygaff goes round;
They will tell again how the Champions twain of the
South Land and the West
Contended so, nor friend nor foe could say who bore
him best.
How well Lord HARRIS'S splendid team upheld old
England's fame!
How MUKDOCH'S men the honours halved and played
their up-hill game;
Punch to his own young lions drinks; but he brims a
beaker too,
And lifts bis shout for our kinsmen stout from'the Land
of the Kangaroo!
VERY LIKELY.
WE read in the Daily Telegraph:—
"Turkey will not be invited to participate with the other
European Powers in the forthcoming Naval Demonstration."
We are glad to be able to add to the above piece of
news a few invaluable items of intelligence of a some-
what similar nature:—
1. Master TOMMY JENKINS, who is now suffering
durance vile in the coal-hole, owing to the concerted
action of the two chief Domestic Powers, Mr. and Mrs.
JENKINS, for the crime of refusing to give up his best
alley-tor to Master JIMMY TOMKLNS, wifl not be invited
to participate in the preparations which are now being
made to give him a good sound whipping when he emerges
from confinement.
2. Mr. BILL SIKES will not be invited to participate
with Mr. Justice HAWKINS when the latter pronounces
sentence on him (Mr. SIKES) for some trifling laches con-
nected with erroneous theories as to the rights of private
property. On the contrary, Mr. SIXES, who, in the
''give and take" of life, has hitherto been exclusively
occupied with the "take," will find that the judicial
application of the above phrase is that Mr. Justice
HAWKINS gives the punishment, and that he, Mr. SIKES,
takes it.
3. And, finally, Mr. SIKES begs to give notice that if
he is ever restored to his proud birthright as a free
Briton, he will not in all cases deem it necessary to in-
vite the participation of casual passers-by when he is
negotiating the transfer of their watches, silk pocket-
handkerchiefs, and purses from their pockets to his
own.
Her Majesty's Haverley's.
ONE of the best things in the Mastodon Minstrels'
performance is the Champion Transformation Dance.
The whole programme is certainly the most go-a-head
Nigger Entertainment we 've seen for some considerable
time—varied as a kaleidoscope; never stopping; the
Minstrel Boys taking encores in a sharp, bubiness-like
on-we-go-again sort of manner, sometimes on the stage,
sometimes in the orchestra, giving themselves scanty
breathing time, and the audience no thinking time, de-
lighting everybody, specially the Antiquarian, who may
here see the Mastodon, and study his original Bones.

ANTHONY DOLLOP.
CHAPTER XV.
AFTER THB FAIR.
THE next day Canon Mvmx woke up with a headache, bat
having availed himself of a prescription given him years ago by his
old friend the Bishop of SODA-AND-BEE, he felt sufficiently recovered
to reflect calmly and deliberately on his next step. The Small-
Beerjester Chronicle published tne intelligence that the Deanery
was vacant, a piece of news that had been known in London some
weeks before it reached Small- Beerjester. Bat the Canon had other
views just at this moment: he flew at higher game than a Dean's-
hat and gaiters, and probably it had struck him that could he oust
Dr. DOWDIK he might himself step into the episcopal shoes. The
revenues of the see were considerable, and sufficient to support two
luxuriously. But who would be the other one? Not MORLBKNA:
that was at an end, and M. MATTEX anticipated a pleasant and
effective vengeance in the prospect of exercising his power when he
should be Bishop of Small-Beerj ester, to depose the Arohbeaoon, to
excommunicate Preoentor ARABLE, to dismiss Mr. SIMONY SIMPLER
the Master of Deedler's, and to supply their places with his own
creatures who would be subservient to his will and pleasure. He
would even go so far as to recall JOHN BOUNCE, ordain him and
make him Beadle and Percenter of Small-Beerj ester Cathedral on
the consideration of his sharing the fees and emoluments. And who
should be Dean P
"Dean," he murmured to himself, as he looked at his watch,
"J« dine chez elle," and smiling at his own conceit, he brushed his
hair, arranged his white tie, drew on his best gloves, and humming
"My own, my Guiding Star!" he set off in the direction of La
Marohesa's hotel, for at the Canon's request she had taken up her
quarters at the well-known Hostelrie called The Crumpet and
Crazier, the best Inn in any Cathedral city in England.
At the moment of his entrance La Marchesa di ZAZZEGLIA was on
the table in the act of pirouetting before the glass. Placing her fair
hand on Mr. MATTIX'S shoulder, she leapt lightly and gracefully to
the floor.
"I was thinking of yon," she said.
Mr. MATTES pressed her hand with both of his. It was like a
piece of delicate veal between two slices of ham. Then she took
his hand between hers. It was another tableau to see; a piece of
underdone beef between two layers of the whitest bread. She was
graceful as the celebrated Venus of Mile End, while he was only a
raw Adonis ready to be done brown at the fire of her eyes.
"Oh, my own one!" exclaimed Mr. MATTIX, as he knelt before
her. He was fond of kneeling, unprofessionally. and out of the
Cathedral. "Oh, my own one! my Cleopatra! my Dido! my
CEnone 1 my Clytemnestra! my Venus! my Juno! my Hebe! my
Multum-in-Parvo t May I call you mine?"
"Yes," replied the Marchesa, "if it gives you any pleasure."
Mr. MATTIX blushed to the very roots of his hair.
"We will go on a tour," said the Marohesa.
"We will. A wedding-tour."
"Yes, we '11 be married first, if you like." Mr. MATTES sank at her
feet, and declared that the Bishop should unite them that very day,
and the Marohesa continued,—" But when I say 'Tour' I mean a
professional tour."
Mr. MATTEC was not quite so ready with his answer this time, but
he threw on the Marohesa a look ot tenderness which she accepted
as a perfect assent to the proposal.
"We '11 go in for it thoroughly. Three months in all the principal

places. I know the ropes. Picture posters everywhere, representing
Zazzeglia and the Canon. Here look!" and she produced a large
drawing and held it before the eyes of the enamoured clergyman.
"Now." she exclaimed, before he had got over his first astonish-
ment, "I will illustrate the idea in person," and touching a spring
in her bodice her dress flew off as if by mnjjic, and showed her in
the dazzling costume portrayed on the advertisement.
Then she whirled round like a cockchafer, and Mr. MATTIX, carried
away by the novelty of the situation, pursued her as vainly as he
might have run after a brilliant butterfly, falling over the chairs
and tables and bruising his ancles in the chase.
"This is a very shin-ful proceeding," laughed the Marchesa, as
her devoted admirer paused for breath. "Now I'll teach you a
pat ile two," and taking Mr. MATTIX'S hand she twirled him round
and round in a mortal agony lest he should fall headlong into the
fender, and then, spinning him like a top, she sent him with one
whirl into the corner, where he sat till of a heap, gasping, panting,
and utterly, hopelessly, enamoured of his enchantress.
"There are more ichirPdi than one," he sighed to himself, as he
beheld her still carelessly pirouetting.
"We shall make a heap of money on the tour," said the Marchesa.
"Money is not everything," pleaded the Canon, who thought he
might as well make one last effort to keep up his clerical character.
"No," she returned, "and everything is not money. You can
return afterwards with heaps of coin, and be Bishop, Archbishop,
what you like."
"If I could induce the Bishop to accompany us," he broke in.
"Well, why not? Bring him."
An idea occurred to Mr. MATTIX. Under the influence of this
siren of the Dead Sea, several ideas were occurring to him of a very
novel and unclerical character. What to her were Bishops and
Curates, and Deans and Archbeacons, except she could use tnem as
shining lights for an evening's alfresco entertainment? And, after
all, if she were once his, what matter to him what became of the
Bishop of Small-Beerj ester. Did he not hate Mrs. DOWDIB? Would
it not be well to compromise Dr. DOWDIE, to get him out on such a
tour as that proposed by the Marchesa, then to represent his conduct
in the highest quarters, and to walk into his Bishopric himself!
Yes. Here was the design.
Mr. MATTIX loved wildly, madly, furiously, and truly. La Mar-
chesa did not love at all, but she knew every move on the board, and
she foresaw a brilliant success, an independence in store for her, and
a position in society far above that of her old companions, the Blue
Boy, Pantaleone, Scaramouch, and the other Circus people.
"1 am free," she exclaimed, "the Bishop will marry us. Bring
him. If you love me. bring him."
"Love you! I do! But"
"Don't but me," she cried, warding him off with both hands.
"I won't. I will do all you ask," and, unable to resist her smile,
he kissed her hand again and again, and was stretching out his arm
to draw the little form still nearer to him, when a sudden sharp
report, as of something falling in the next room, interrupted their
tete-d-tete, and caused the Canon to rush to the door of communica-
tion leading into the next apartment. It was looked, but through
the keyhole he saw a woman stooping and picking up an umbrella
which had dropped and caused the noise.
"Mrs. Dow DIE, by Jingo!" exclaimed Mr. MATTIX, and before La
Marchesa could utter a word he had rushed from the room out into
the passage, and had turned the key of the next apartment.
He returned excitedly to La Marchesa, who was anxious to hear
what had happened.
"Nothing, he replied, in a hurried whisper, "except that Mrs.
DOWDIB has dropped her umbrella while listening to us. She is
locked in."
"The prying old cat!" shouted La Marohesa.
"Yts." and then Mr. MATTES added, "when the oat's away the
mice will play. I am off to the Bishop."
"Good," cried the Marohesa, "pay him his fees for our marriage
ceremony beforehand, and that will encourage him. Three guineas
will do it. Cheque to the Bishop, and we mate in one move!"
"We do! We will 1!" cried the devoted Canon, as he once more
covered her hands with kisses, and rushed from the Hotel.
Off!
Bra,—I was just sitting down to write you a long and exhaustive
article on the Dark Races of the Western World, when my eye sud-
denly lighted on this one line in the 2 P. M. Gazette—" Discovery

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH'S NIGHTMARE.
(A Vision of September.)
IT may have been the
Salmon Mayonnaise,
or it may not. Yet, so
it was!
"Come," said the Spirit
(it was crying). "1 will
show you things that shall
harrow up your soul!"
Then it moved its pen-
like wand. .
In a moment Mr. Punch
found himself in a country
inn. A tourist, clothed in
a cheap, ill-fitting costume,
was angrily expostulating
with the proprietor.
"What! Three shil-
lings a night for a small
room, and eighteen pence
for attendance! As sure
as my name is SMITH, that
I live at Clapham, that I
escape Income-tax as re-
cipient of something less
than a hundred and fifty
pounds a year, will I have
revenge! Mark me well—
as ' A Swindled Traveller'
will I write to the Times!"
The hotel-keeper and his family sank upon their knees as the
vision faded away, giving place to another.
And now the Spirit and nis unwilling companion were in a sub-
urban kitchen-garden. A venerable idiot was busily engaged in
watching the lazy gambols of a corpulent spider.
"A most interesting study," murmured the venerable idiot, "and
one that has given me materials for a letter exceeding in dimensions
a column and a half. I must send it to the Papers."
The Spirit uttered a despairing cry, and waved his pen once more.
A railway station. A lawyer's clerk was chuckling over Brad-
shaw's Time Tables.
"Five minutes late to-day, and to-morrow (come a fortnight)
nearly half an hour too early! What glorious discoveries! My
contribution will look well under the heading of ' Railway Unpunc-
tuality.' Not a moment must be lost in sending my communication
to the Papers."
"And he will be as good as his word!" shrieked the Spirit. "I
have known him for many, many years!"
The Spirit had scarcely spoken when the scene had changed again.
A person with a vacant expression of countenance, conjuring up
recollections of Hanwell and Colney Hatch, sat before a desk in a
study. He looked up as Mr. Punch stood before him. "I was
writing to you!" he cried, in an ecstasy of joy. "I am the in-
ventor of the joke about the hero of the Channel swim being Webb-
footed, and I have just finished an exquisite jeu de mot turning upon
the double meaning of TANNEB the faster and ' tanner' the slang
for sixpence. See, liere !is"
"Take me away 1" gasped Mr. Punch. Then he found himself
in the presence of a lady. Such a lady! Blue spectacles, short iron-
grey ringlets, and fifty-two! With these advantages a long red
nose and a sneer worthy of Mephistopheles.
"I am a spinster," cried this unpleasant-looking female, "and I
warn you that Woman at last shall have her rights 1 In these
twenty pages I have fully expressed my views I"
"Behold, I send them to the Papers f"
"No, no!" murmured Mr. Punch, as he hid his eyes in his
pocket-handkerchief; and now, quite unmanned, wept bitterly.
He was now in a library.
"I have discovered," said a gentleman with very long hair, "that
exactly 46,782 persons pass, on an average, over London Bridge in
the course of a summer's afternoon. I have ascertained, also, that
the word " and" is used no less than 863,472,003 times in the first
edition of Pilgrim's Progress. I have also calculated that"
"But why bore me with these uninteresting facts?" asked Mr.
Punch, interrupting his persecutor.
"Why, indeed?" acquiesced the gentleman with the long hair.
"Will you not see them, and many others of a similar nature, in the
letters I periodically send to the Papers?"
And yet another Scene. A company of beer-bemuddled Agricul-
turists were seated round an empty table—a table that recently had
groaned under the weight of fish, vegetables, and butcher's meat. A
fifth-rate "silent Member" was holding forth in a desultory fashion
upon the affairs of the world in general and the nation in particular.
"Myspeech of many hours' duration will not be lost," thought
the droning bore, as he gazed upon the slumbering faces of nis
audience; as an ' Extra-Parliamentary utterance' it will go down
to fame—in the Papers I"
But here Mr. Punch started up.
"I will see and hear no more! he shrieked. "Who are yon?"
"I am the Spirit of the Press," was the mournful response; "and
these creatures for many weeks will haunt us both. We must learn
to love them."
"Love them! Never! Who are they?"
"The Monsters of Dulness! The Twaddlers that will suck up
every inch of printing space! In a word—the Vampires of the
Silly Season!"
And Punch shuddered as he repeated it. But the Spirit had
vanished without offering him any compensation for his night's
disturbance.
A PICK-ME-UP.
"ZOEDONE " is in everyone's month—at least its proprietors would
be delighted if it were.J; A case was sent us for Counsel's opinion.
The case in question has been since tried
before us magisterially. The opinions of
our Tasting Faculty are—
First.—Zoedone is a first-rate drink for
everyone who likes it.
Secondly.—That to those accustomed to
ginger-beer every day, Zoedone will be a
pleasant change.
Thirdly.—A real saving at children's par-
ties, when, on the immortal Marchioness's
method of dealing with the orange-peel and
water (vide Old Curiosity Shop), the young
idea may be induced to believe that it is
indulging freely in Champagne.
Fourthly.—Zoedone is a blessing—but not
an unmixed blessing.—as it goes capitally
with any spirituous liquor, e.g., brandy,—
the proportions being left to the fancy of
the individual mixer.
Fifthly.—Zoedone may be safely recom-
mended as a beverage for your mother-in-
law," andEas an admirable economical substitute for Sparkling
Rhenish and Moselle Wines for a guest who has been asked for a day
and has invited himself to stay a month.
N.B.—But, seriously, here is our private and confidential tip. It
is a tonic, no doubt about it,; but being rather sweetish, the Zoedone
must be thoroughly iced: then—put a liqueur glass of brandy into a
small tumbler of Zoe. and, if you like shandygaffian sort of dnnking,
you will find this, what the leading Counsel finds his occasional fifty
guineas, a gentle and agreeable Refresher. Solritur drink-no-endo.
Verb. sap. We dedicate to Zoedone this Byronic verse—
Made of something, ere we part.
Tell me, tell me wrist thou art?
If the truth must be confest,
With a nip thou goest best.
"With liqueur, one little " go,"

THE END.
TUESDAY, SEPT. 7, 1880.
(A Vague Reminiscence of Longfellow.)
TAEDILY, wearily,
Reacheth its goal
The Session of '80,
Tired old soul!
Cover the benches,
And put out the light;
Divisions are over,
And sittings all night.
The bells are all dumb,
And idle the wire;
Rant sinks into silence,
Reporters retire.
Fewer and fewer
The few footsteps fall;
Uuiet and Constables
Reign over all!
The World.
THE Drury Lane Advertisement says " there is but one opinion."
Indeed! Quot homines, tot sententits. Does the advertisement imply
that only one person has seen the World? Or that the audi-
ence spoke on the subject as one man? Did it only pay as one man?
But it's good all round, say Messrs. MEBBITT, PETTITT, and HAKRLS,
the three men of the World.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
At the Polytechnic.
OJTE time ago the new Direc-
tors of this Institution did
not seek to disguise the
fact that in their opinion
chemistry had been unduly
sacrificed to oomic enter-
tainments, and that me-
chanical engineering had
been altogether put on one
side to make room for
"ghosts" and optical de-
lusions. But all this, so
the new Managers pro-
mised, was to be changed.
On entering I purchased
a programme. This was the first change of
the new Management. In the olden days the
book used to cost a penny or twopence—now
the price was raised to threepence. However,
I was amply repaid for the extra outlay by
finding that I had bought The Polytechnic
Journal; a Museum of Literature, Science,
and Technology. Amongst the contributors
to this unique publication were Lord JEFFREY
(whose name appeared to a memoir of JAMES WATT), Bishop HEBEB
(who furnished a column about "Egyptian Ruins"), and other
contemporaneous writers. The four pages devoted to " Literature,
Science, and Technology," contained three letters addressed "to
the Editor." The first two anent "Racing in Engines" and
"Anomalous Action of Whitworth Planes," were answered; but
the last, about " Rejuvenescence," remained unsolved. As a proof
that the contents of the Journal scarcely merited the designation of
"light reading," I give an extract from the latter:—

thed
solution oi ._ . . _ . .
iciemce, and I should be glad if jour readers would try their penetration
upon it."
Having " tried my penetration upon it," I could only murmur, in
humble tones, "Query—Anti-Fat?" But the gem of the paper
was unquestionably an article upon the " Secret of Success," written
presumably (as it was unsigned) t>y the erudite Editor himself. Here
is an extract which strikes the key-note of the Essay :—
"The most important element of succeis is economy—economy of money
and economy of time Our recipe for succeeding in the world, then, IB
this—work much and spend little."
Thus prepared for an " economical," but scientific entertainment,
I entered the Large Lecture-Room, and was immediately mulcted
sixpence for a seat that under the old management had been accorded
"without any extra charge." I found the audience (not a large one)
busily employed in munching toffy, which had evidently been pur-
chased in the Institution during the hour and a half so generously
allowed by the Directors for the enjoyment of the initial item on the
programme—" Inspection of going Machinery and different Ex-
nibitf." When the stock of nutritious sweetstuff was all but
exhausted, a well-informed gentleman appeared at an illuminated
desk, and disclaiming (in the dark) any scientific pretensions for his
lecture, said that he was there to exhibit " the oxy-hydrogen micro-
scop*," which, he added, "had recently been greatly improved by
the addition of new achromatic powers." After this he seemed
less certain of his ground, and appeared to be playing a sort of game
of illuminated questions and verbal answers with the officials in
charge of the dissolving views. Thus, when the officials threw any-
thing on the disc, the Lecturer hastened to say what it was. For
instance, a thing looking like a gigantic elephant appeared suddenly
with a jerk on the screen. But the well-informed gentleman was
not im the least surprised. "That," he exclaimed triumphantly,
"i§ a water-beetle!" The elephant hurriedly disappeared, and, after
a pause, an unconventional portmanteau took its place. The Lecturer
was again equal to the occasion. "And that," he continued
promptly, as u solving a complicated but easily-unravelled conun-
drum, "is the eye of the water-beetle enormously magnified!"
The officials " tried " the Lecturer with a number of other objects,
inclusive of a " Daddy Longlegs," a bit of flannel, the gizzard of a
cricket, and (to quote the Polytechnic Journal) "some Living
Inhabitants of our Ponds and Ditches, illustrated by numerous living
specimens." But no, he knew them all, and hadn't to guess twice
for any one of them I This was the more remarkable, as he must
have wondered how they (the officials in charge of the dissolving
views) "could ever think of such clever things!" After this came
some pictures called " London as it is and was," chiefly remarkable
for a "mythical sketch" of Town as a dismal swamp, and some
VOL. LXitx. 1

highly interesting photographs (especially to Londoners) of the
Mansion House and other neighbouring buildings.
And now the stage was cleared for the feature of the programme.
Presumably in the cause of scientific research and technical educa-
tion, the Directors had engaged "the Aoisoif Family." The
curtain rose, and discovered a scene representing some illuminated
tea-gardens. Then a poor little person (the sex was uncertain) in a
purple suit, appeared with a stereotyped smile, and danced about in
a mechanical manner. He (or she) was soon followed by three smaller
children carrying whips. The four then sang, in the shrillest of
shrill voices, :' The Three Jolly Waggoners," " The Roast Beef of
Old England" and "John Barleycorn." One of these little ones
was a wee mite called
"Baby EDITH," and it
was painful to watch her.
as, with painted eyes and
rouged cheeks, she unsuc-
cessfully strove to throw
some sort of spirit into an
"Entertainment" (save
the mark !) about as dull
as the water of "our
Ponds and Ditches!" The
"John Barleycorn" glee
had a disagreeable taste,
because the poor children attempted to give a point to their meaning
by rubbing their waists after the fashion of a Clown in a transpontine
pantomime. The company was now strengthened by a youth in a false
moustache, and a lady. The latter sang "My Pretty Page" with
"Baby EDITH," who in this scene appeared to be more than usually
anxious to do her best. The programme included Miss FABKEN'H
song, " Crutch and Toothpick," with the dance cut out, the " Bold
Qendames" (tic) by the youth in the false moustache and another
"baby," and some "nursery rhymes." A topical duet, " Moses and
Aaron" (suggestive of the music-halls), was announced, but omitted.
In its stead, the child who had strutted about in the lime-light as
the hero of "the crutch and toothpick" (poor little dot!), gave an
unpleasantly precocious rendering of " I am such an Artless Thing."
To put it mildly, the engagement of " the AJJESON Family " by the
Director* of the Polytechnic Institution cannot do much to advance
the interests of either Science or Technical Education.
It was quite a relief when the Lecturer who had so successfully
answered the "puzzles" earlier in the day returned to his illuminated
desk, and told us all he knew about (to quote the programme)
"Modern Guns, 4c." The "all" was delightful, but it did not quite
exhaust the subject from an artilleryman's point of view.
And now we had reached the last item
—" Asmodeus and the Bottle-Imp," by
"Professor ROBERT HELLIS."
"Come," I thought, "this is encou-
raging. So far the entertainment has
b«en lacking in scientific research. Here
is a Professor at last; and now I may
expect something really great in the
'ologies.'"
But I was doomed to disappointment.
The Professor commenced his lecture by
saying that he was a Ventriloquist, and
that he begged to introduce to our notice
two puppet friendsof his—an old lady and
an old gentleman. Then we had the usual
kind of thing. The male puppet con-
fined his remarks to allusions of a purely
personal character.
",You haven't much trouble in combing your hair!" remarked
the figure, opening and closing his mouth " smartly."
"What,.Sir?" asked the Professor politely, in a seemingly fatigued
undertone, and evidently to emphasise the observation.
"You haven't much trouble in combing your hair!" repeated the
puppet, with the same spasmodic movement of its mouth.
"Don't be rude, Sir I " remonstrated the Ventriloquist, stroking a
bald pate, and mildly feigning anger.
"Your head would make a capital skating-rink for flies!" retorted
the figure. After ten minutes of this mirth-provoking entertainment,
the puppets were dismissed, and the Professor gravely informed us
"that he had some influence over an Imp." Upon this a mournful
lad, in an eccentric costume, was introduced upon the stage, to be
locked in a box, and to appear (with the aid of a pane of glass that
was very visible to the audience) in a gigantic bottle. This ended the
entertainment so far as I was concerned, as I refused the kind and
pressing invitation of an official "to wait and go down with a party
in the diving-bell."
As I left the building I could not help recalling the past glories o1
the old place. The new Directors may have secured "economy,"
but they certainly have not achieved success at the Royal Polytechnic
Institution—" Limited!"

AGONY-POINT AMUSEMENTS AGAIN.
NOT for one hundred consecutive hours, as the ad-
vertisements seemed to sugeest, but for one hundred
hours in sir days, had poor Miss BKCKWITH undertaken
to play the porpoise in a tank at the Aquarium. And
it must be admitted that in this graceful girl-swimmer
the porpoise has found a formidable rival. She seems
as much at home in the water as Arion's dolphin, or
a South-Sea Islander. An exhibition pleasing enough
in itself but for its ridiculous and cruel prolongation.
The very tedium must be dull torment. Adroitly devised
interludes, bouquets and lime-light effects cannot hide
the palpable facts of fatigue, restless weariness, and
Injurious exhaustion. Interested persons will no doubt
advance plausible defences, but to common sense and
(food feeling the thing is found indefensible. Fits of chil-
liness, headache, nausea, chest-soreness, hacking cough,
loss of appetite, and sleeplessness, however intermittent,
and however much minimised, tell their own tale.
The fact remains that the physical powers of a girl are
being over-taxed to provide the public with questionable
amusement, and serve the purposes of betting-men and
speculators. The public, putting personal selfishness and
professional casuistry resolutely aside, should look that
fact fairly in the face, and then what remains to be said
for such fruitless exhibitions of painful endurance!'
Nothing, surely, that anyone but a callous pleasure-
seeker or a cynical sporting-man will care to urge.
The graceful evolutions of a young girl, who can dive
like a pearl-finder, float like a mermaid, slip through
the water like a seal, and perform agile and fanciful
freaks that neither seal, mermaid, or pearl-finder ever
thought of, are interesting enough, and legitimate enough
performances for public exhibition, provided always that
they are not so strained or prolonged as to cause distress
or injury to the performer. Where a feat becomes painful
to the exhibitor, it should cease to be pleasurable to the
spectator. When suffering is found amusing, amuse-
ment becomes brutalising. The road is straight and
clear, though it may seem long, from the Aquarium to
the Bull-ring, or the Arena. This is the plain principle
which should be clearly seized and firmly enforced by
all who desire to raise an effective protest against
Agony-point Amusements.

OUK DEAE DUKE OF MUDFOBD,
Do not allow your Grace to be moved into any undue activity
by the remarks of a ribald Press. Look at us! The papers made
offensive, uncalled-for, and ungentlemanly remarks about our action
with regard to Temple Bar for over five-and-twenty years. Did it
have any effect? No. For Temple Bar fell down of its own accord.
And now your Grace sees we are erecting a far more efficient barrier
against traffic than was ever the late lamented Bar. Will your
Grace take a hint? Pull down your gates, and put up drawbridges.
That's the way to settle the Press.
Your Grace's obedient Servants,

CHAPTER. XVI.
SUGGESTIO FALSI.

a. MATTIX. on quitting
the Marohesa, walked
that Mrs. DOWDIE had
been in the next room,
with her ear to the key-
hole, and he also knew
that all now depended
upon his immediate in-
terview with the Bishop,
who was yearning for
emancipation from hia
thraldom.
He found Dr. DOWDIE
alone in his sanctum,
twiddling his thumbs,
and rubbing hia knees.
In a few concise speeches
he put him in possession
of the object of hia viait,
and stated that if the
Bishop consented first to
join him and the Mar-
ohesa as man and wife,
and afterwards to join
them himself as a friend,
they might be the nu-
cleus with the Marchesa's companions. Pantalepue, Scaramouch, and
Arlequino of a first-rate Provincial Travelling Company, with a
fortune before them in the future. After hearing his acrobatic
notions, the Bishop pondered a moment, then rising from his chair,
turned three times htad-over-heels on the library-floor.
"What does your Lordship mean by that?" asked the Chaplain.
"Why?" replied the good Bishop; "the meaning is very simple.
You aaked me if 1 tumbled to the idea? I did: 1 tumbled to it.
Now go on."
"We can do a good business on tour," Mr. MATTIX observed.
The Bishop rubbed his knees, and observed, that he thought it was
highly probable.
Of course Mrs. DOWDIE must be kept in the dark," the Chaplain
went on, slightly lowering his voice.
The Bishop looked round nervously. Some little monitor within
the Bishop's breast whispered that the woman whom it was thus
proposed to him to keep in the dark was his own wife; and what a
wife, oh Bishop, thou too well knowest! To enlighten such a woman
would be but to kindle a conflagration. Hadst thou not better,
Bishop, remain in thy sanctum discontentedly, yet for all that
treated with outward respect, and fed well and regularly? But
there was another monitor, which advised him differently, and as
follows :—" Cut the apron-strings, Bishop. Go forth, 0 Christian
warrior, and enjoy yourself! Cast off the old woman, and soar forth
with the freshness of paint, the merriment of a grig, and the
friskiness of a parched pea on a big drum I Go it, you Christian
Cripple! You '11 never do it no younger!"
Ail this passed within the Bishop's bosom, as Mr. MATTIX sat
opposite him, pencil in hand, ready to draw out a plan of the pro-
posed tour, and to calculate expenses. Slowly the Bishop closed his
right eye, and nodded to his Chaplain to proceed.
Satisfied with this sign of encouragement, which plainly indicated
the commencement of premeditated mutiny in the camp, Mr. MATTIX
continued in a low and earnest tone, which went right to his
Diocesan's heart.
"Say our tour lasts three months to begin with. You can travel
with the Marchesa di ZAZZEOLIA, and we will alternately go on as
Agent in advance."
The Bishop nodded again, rubbed hia knees slowly, and listened
attentively.
"Of course yon will not have much to do, my Lord, as I shall
arrange all the advertisements. You will be the Great Attrac-
tion. You will be announced everywhere as The Sevenansixpenny
Ordinary at Five o'clock every afternoon. You will merely have to
sing one song, ' The See .' The See .'' and will appear, accompanied
by the Marcheea on the guitar."
This was too much in unison with my Lord's feelings to be
altogether unpalatable; yet before he determined on the step, he
wished to hear further details.
"Your Lordship will approve of this first-rate picture-poster,"
said Mr. MATTIX, with a twinkle in his eye as he drew from his
pocket a carefully-folded sheet on which was portrayed in three
colours a figure of the Marchesa di ZAZZEOLIA in full acrobatic cos-
tume flying through the air, while a likeness of Canon MATTIX was
kneeling with his hands stretched out towards her in one corner, the
legend below being "La ZAZZEOLIA flying from the Canon I"
The Bishop carefully examined the picture and rubbed hia knees
with an air of considerable satisfaction.
"And did she?" presently inquired Dr. DOWDIE. slily.
"Did she what, your Lordship?" asked his Chaplain.
"Fly from the Canon, eh?" and the good old Bishop chuckled
with suppressed merriment as he dug his episcopal f oreflnger into
his Chaplain's ribs, and made him wince again. iSHien the Bishop
felt at home with a friend he liked his otium cum dig in the ribs.
"Your Lordship," replied the Chaplain demurely, casting down
his eyes and defending himself from the fun which had been digitally
poked at him, "the Lady is only waiting for you to unite the
Canon -"
"Ignite the Canon, you mean," interrupted the Bishop, who, in
view of his freedom, was becoming merrier and merrier every mo-
ment, and being hardly able to 'restrain a shout of laughter, was
sorely put to it by being compelled to chuckle in silence, "which
effort, Dr. DOWDIE said in a choking whisper, "is sure to give me
the buttercups, I mean the hiccups."
"If your Lordship makes me laugh so," whispered the Chaplain,
who was so struck with the humour of the situation as to be almost
hysterical, "I shall explode."
"Remember you 're a Canon, and don't. The noise of your ex-
plosion would bring down Mrs. DOWDIE, like a bird," exclaimed
the Bishop anxiously. With hia new ally at his elbow he felt him-
self ready to face even Mrs. DOWDIE with composure. Still he would
rather defer the evil moment, as many a man in his circumstances
has done before him, if he could not avoid it altogether, and leave
the Palace without her interference.
Mr. MATTIX continued:—
"YourjLordship will unite the Marchesa and myself"
"With pleasure," replied his Lordship, amiably."
"And then we three will take a Provincial tour. Sharing ex-
penses and profits."
"Quite so," rejoined, the Bishop, considerably mollified by the
proposal. "Halves."
"Decidedly," answered his Chaplain. "As I have already said,
we shall advertise you as one of the chief attractions, and give you
a line all to yourself in the bills. You will put yourself down for a
salary."
"My charge will be heavy," said the Bishop.
"It generally was—at least so the clergy said at a visitation; but
they bore it, and we will accommodate the prices to your charges."
"Good!" said the Bishop, rubbing 'the calf of his leg, "nothing
could be fairer. What shall I have to do for it?"
"Play a pastoral before the show begins, and—when you were
at college didn't your Lordship get an Exhibition P"
"Certainly."
"Does your Lordship happen to have it now?"
"Yes. It is in excellent order. But it will require a caravan to
itself. Do you propose my showing it?" asked Dr. DOWDIE.
"Between the first and second parts," replied Mr. MATTIX. ""We
can travel in the Caravan and entitle the show 'Dr. DOWDIE'S
College Exhibition." Having been accustomed to examine candi-
dates for orders in your Lordship's diocese, I will undertake the
acting-management, and will find out everywhere exactly who are
the people to whom orders should be given, and to whom they should
be refused. As a rule the free list will be suspended"
"Any clergyman belonging to my own diocese presuming to come
in without paying shall be suspended at once," observed the Bishop,
with his severest air of authority. "What does the Marchesa say f"
"She consents, of course. She is willing she says to 'seek the
bubble reputation even in the Canon's mouth,'" answered the
Chaplain.
"The bubble!" repeated the Bishop. Then sinking his voice to
a whisper, he said, "Blow the bubble, my boy! but if Mrs.
DOWDIE 's anywhere about"
Scarcely were the words out of Dr. DOWDIE'S month than there
was a rustle at the door, which was thrown open, and in stalked
Mrs. DOWDIE herself.

The Peasant. They whacks us, my Lord.

The Peasant. Not me, my Lord; but it does him. He taps me
across the hand with a cane, and my Mother goes in and bashes him
over the head with a poker, and gets him fined for assaulting me.
The Peer. Why, I got swished four times in a fortnight, without
doing anything of that sort.

A FAMOUS HOLIDAY.
IT was a summer evening,
The Pointsman's work was done];
And he before his own box door
Felt precious glad for one;
And by him loafed about the line
The Night-watch, due at half-past^nine.
And, as he loafed about, he came
On something flat and round.
That smashed had caught his shuffling feet
Upon the gravelled ground.
And then he asked what he had found
That was so smashed—yet flat and round.
The Pointsman took it from his m-te
Who stood all sleepy by:
And then he clapped it on his head
And said, "Lor' bless you—why.
It's what some bloke dropped by tne way
On that there last Bank 'oliday 1
"I often come across 'em here,
There 'a many round about;
Why, if you had to find your 'ats,
That ditch would rig you out!
There's scores of 'em, so 1 've heard say,
Wos dropped on that there 'oliday."
".Now tip us 'ow it come about,"
The other, drowsy, cries.
The while, the crownless chimney-pot
Upon his head he tries.
"Now, tip us: say, whose job it wor P
What did he smash the 'Scursion for?"
"JIM'S wor that job," the Pointsman said;
"He 'ad too long a bout!
But what he smashed the 'Scvrsioti for
1 never could make out.
He fell a blinkin, I dus say,
And took his little 'oliday!
"But them as was a-takin' theirs
(And some-^it was their last),
Was 'appy, singin' of their songs:
And, as she busted past,
You might 'ave heard 'em, laughin', say,
'This 'ere's a famous 'oliday! f
"So, when she come upon them points,
As crammed as you could pack,
And not a soul a-chaffin' there
Know'd death lay on the track,—
It did seem 'ard in that there way
To end their ' famous holiday!'
"And, oh! it was a 'orrid sight,
When off the line she run,
With dozens lying stiff and still,
Who started full of fun!
But, there—had J m now not give way,
They 'd 'ad a famous 'oliday I
"He got it precious 'qt for that I"
The other stroked his chin.
"Maybe. But it's the Company,"
Said he, "I'd like to skin!
I 'd let 'em all at Bot'ny Bay
Just try their famous 'oliday!"
The Pointsman faced his mate. Quoth he,
"Where can your reok'ning be P
Here's parties pays a bob or two,
And gets three hours <>' sea;
And, (/' they ain't smashed up, I say,
That there 'B a famous 'oliday."
"And. what's to come," the other asked,
"Of scares now like this 'ere P"
The Pointsman smiled. "My mate," he said,
"Fou're green, that's pretty clear.
Why, 'what's to come'? Next year, I '11 lay,
Another famous 'oliday!"

THE fat mud churned by many a heavy wain
Into putresoent hotch-potch slab ana slimy,
The pavements fouled by Totting leaves and rain,
The gutters choked, all greasy, grubby, grimy;
Here frowsy bulks potato-stored, a-dnst,
There tumble-down strange structures shored and hoarded,
A sodden slime doth all things here inorust;
A sad and sooty scene, unsavoury, sordid.
The clamorous carman yells upon his cart,
The foul-mouthed coster curses by the kerb, he
Uncurbed; for this is London's loveliest mart,
Its Rut in Urbe!
Hence radiate muck-choked roadways far around,
Which strike the strange wayfarer with wild wonder
What midden huge, what central garbage-mound,
From fairer thoroughfares these sludge-ways sunder.
No cottage dast-heap, cumbered with stale waste
Of a year's joskin-fodder, smells more rankly;
No reeking swamp, whence nose-nipt travellers haste,
.Seethes 'nuath the sun more dirtily and dankly.
All sluggish vehicles that are, upohoke
These foul and fetid roadways, dusk and narrow,
Waggon, cart, truck, and, with sonorous " moke,"
The coster's barrow.
How foot unfouled, how thread unshouldered, clean,
These dolorous ways? Here tumbles the tost hamper,
There flies'stale garden-stuff that once was green,
Hudgrubbers grope, and shoeless urchins scamper.
The hobnailed churl with elephantine hoof
Slops sullenly along, uncouth, uncaring,
And brazen girls slack-garmented, shame-proof,
Hustle and holloa, draggletailed and daring.
Piled cabbages and basket-barriers block
The devious ways, and sacks, and crates, and cases;
And frowzy crones with grey and ton/led shocks,
And wrinkled faces.
Whence haply issuing—if luck so will—
Come we upon a low, uncomely cluster
Of roofs and avenues; nor taste nor skill
Decks these arcades, wherennder closely muster
Vendors of—rags and refuse? mud? manure?
Not so; of Nature's choicest, cheeriest benisons;
Of luscious fruits, and flowers fair as pure,
Worthy of song from lyres as sweet as TEirarson'8.
And nought, save care in storage and display,
Needs there to make this rookery, Covent Garden,
As a Duke's pleasaunce trim, and green and gay
As any Arden.
Did Dux mean leader still, and not a slow
Reluctant follower of all improvement,
We might have all this altered at a blow
With some alert " His Grace " to lead the movement.
Shall dull patricians and parochial dolts
Perpetuate the nuisance? Punch protesteth.
While the Duke's Dusthole every sense revolts,
And in the midst of Babylon muokdom nesteth,
He means to peg away, since, for his part,
Whatever vested interest it disturb, he
Holds Covent Garden might, in London's heart,
Be Rut in Urbe f
Something in It.

LAYS OF A LAZY MINSTREL.
V.—THE TAM o' SHANTER CAP.
Upon the Spa at Scarborough, the Minstrel was a panter—
He asked a Wilful Maiden why she wore a Tarn o' Shant«r?
She gazed upon his furrowed face, half doubting if he chaffed her,
Then, noting well his solemn mien, she answered thus, with laughter :—
ET others wear, upon the Spa,
The "Rubens" hat or

Tuscan straw,
With margueritet upon
it—
The "Pamela," of quaint

hat,

other that
Is anything but canny.

long,
Or full.

I '11 wear my Tarn o' Shanter.
I '11 wear it if it's hot or cold,

STARVATION FROM SPIRITUALISM.
IP yon are asked to give an example of a fool's question, answer
"Cui bono t" Possible truth means possible, even though for the
present unintelligible, good. This your fool does not see. If the
alleged facts of Spiritualism were not fallacies, the question " Cui
bono t" objected to Spiritualism would be a fool's.
Believers in Spiritualism, however, on the other hand, may some
of them have the confidence to ask, "CM! malo f" (What's the
harm of it?) An answer to that demand is afforded by evidence
given at a recent inquest as to the death of an unhappy simpleton
who starved himself to death by an attempt at " doing Dr. TANNER'S
fast." It was to be expected that one fool would make many. A
witness deposed that—
"Last Wednesday week he asked the deceased,' Why don't you take some
food?' and he replied, ' Mind your own business. The spirits will keep me
alire.' Deceased was a Spiritualist."
Notwithstanding this testimony, however, the jury returned a
verdict that " deceased died from inanition owing to want of food,
and that death was caused by misadventure."
Were the gentlemen of the jury Spiritualists likewise? and was
that their reason for not finding that their condisciple destroyed
himself by starvation under the influence of insanity?

JUSTICES' JUSTICE;
HOW (NOT) TO RECTIFY IT.
(Vide Recent Correspondence in Daily Papers.)
From the Home Secretary to J. P. Stroud, Esq.
SIR,—My attention has been called not only by the outspoken
comments of the Press, but by the indignant questions of several
Members of that House of which I have the honour to be the greatest
ornament, to the fact that last month you sentenced a boy named
WILLIAM GONOFF, and aged nine years, to fourteen days' imprison-
ment for stealing a shilling's-worth of turnips. An explanation of
so marvellous a miscarriage of justice will oblige,
Yours truly, HISTORICUS.
Prom J. P. Stroud to the Home Secretary.
DEAR SIR HISTORICUS,—I sentenced the youth named WILLIAM
GONOFF—whose right age is fifteen, by the bye—to ten days' imprison-
ment for stealing a pound's-worth of turnips, and for assaulting the
police. Will this suit you? Yours truly, J. P. STBOTJD.
From the Home Secretary to J. P. Stroud, Esq.
SIR,—I am credibly informed that the child, WILLIAM GONOFF,
was sentenced by you to a month's hard labour for stealing six-
pennyworth of turnips, and that his age is five. Your explanation
is unsatisfactory. Yours truly, HISTOKICUS.
P.S.—You ought to have flogged him.
From J. P. Stroud to the Home Secretary.
DEAR HISTORICCS,—WILLIAM GONOFF is forty-seven, and he was
sentenced to three days' imprisonment for stealing two acres of
turnips, and for assaulting five policemen. Since then he has mur-
dered his grandmother, has committed bigamy, and has burnt a
church. Are you satisfied now? Yours sincerely,
J. P. SHROUD.
P.S.—I had no power to flog him.
From the Home Secretary to J. P. Stroud.
SIR,—The tone of your explanation is completely wrong. I repeat
you ought to have flogged WILLIAM GONOFF.
Yours truly, HISTORICUS.
From J. P. Stroud to the Home Secretary.
DEAB OLD MAN,—If you are so precious fond of flogging WILLIAM
GONOFF, why didn't you oome and do it yourself?
Yours ever, J. P. STHOFD.
From the Home Secretary to J. P. Stroud.
SIR,—I will let you know whom you are calling "dear old man."
I order the immediate release of WILLIAM GONOFF.
Yours truly,
HISTOBICUS.
From J. P. Stroud to the Home Secretary.
HA! ha! What a wag you are I WILLIAM GONOFF was released
four days before your first communication ever reached me. You
old quiz! Yours, my boy, J. P. STBOUD.
From the Home Secretary to J. P. Stroud.
Sis,—Why the deuce didn't you tell me that WILLIAM GONOFF
had been released before I commenced this weighty correspondence?
Yours truly, HISTORICT/S.
From J. P. Stroud to the Home Secretary.
DKAB OLD CUSST,—Did you ever see TOOLE in let on parle Fran-
gais t If not, get somebody to give you an order. I will reply as
does Mr. TOOLE in that play, that I didn't tell you that WILLIAM
GONOFF had been released before you commenced your correspond-
ence—" 'Cos you didn't arst me, cos you didn't arst me." I am

YEB READS WKLL, AN' TEE SPILLS
A SUCCESS SCORED AT THE PROMENADE CONCERTS.
\Vn woulda't have missed the Humorous Night at the Promenade
Concerts for a trifle—and we 're very fond of trifle. The house was
cram-jammed from ceiling to floor by an audience that showed itself
decidedly appreciative and strictly critical. They were there to enjoy
real wit in music, and would stand no nonsense. They didn't care a
sixth of their entrance-money for some of the compositions, which
oould well have been spared from the programme, but Mo/.ART'S
Village Musicians (a musical joke), created quite a furore. It was
immense. Mr. A. BURNETT, as one of the chief village violinists,
played the part to perfection. How the audience roared when he
seriously got into an impossible key, and had to come back again
somehow. They encored him to the echo, but Mr. COWER knew that
so delicate a jest would not bear immediate repetition, and wisely
went on with the next movement. The horns perpetually coming in
out of tune evoked shouts of laughter, and the triumphantly discor-
dant finish was greeted with prolonged and enthusiastic applause.
Passing over Miss MABT DAVIES' Song, and WEBER'S Caprice, we
came to SCHEBZ'S humorous Meditation on a German Air—a bad
title, by the way, as the composition was simply a series of Musical
Burlesque pieces on BACH, MOZART, MENDELSSOHN, &o.
That on MOZABT was the best, as being a caricature of a style:
the Military March was next; and then the Burlesque of VERDI:
but, on the whole, there was too little in it of the real spirit of
original caricature, and too much of very ordinary Burlesque talent.
However, it was successful, though anything would have had to be
very first-rate, coming after The Village Musicians.
Then Miss ANTOINETTE STERLING sang MoLLor's Nursery Song,
"The Baby and the Fly." The only humorous point about this
was the fact that Miss STEELING had to sing it. A Comic Song for
Mrs. SIDDONS would have been about as appropriate. A good Low
Comedian in petticoats might have done something with it; but aa
it was, it served as padding, or being Mr. MOLLOT'S, as paddy-ing
between SCHEBZ'S Imitations of Popular Composers, and ROKBERG'B
Toy Symphony. As the Chief of the orchestra entered, bearing
toy-drums, rattles, penny-trumpets, and bird-whistles, they were
greeted with cheers. The Symphony was successful, chiefly as a
curiosity; and Mr. A. BURNETT as the Cuckoo, Mr. HUGHES as the
Melancholy Quail, Messrs. ELLIS and REYNOLDS as the Toy
Trumpets, and Messrs. HORTON and OVLD as agreeable Rattles,
were a real treat.
Then Mr. RIOBT sang something, not a word of which reached as,
except one line which sounded like, "Lift up your fist and hit me
straight in the eye," but as this could by no possibility have formed
any part of a sentimental song, we only quote our impression of it,
being unable to refer to our programme which had long ago fluttered
away on to the heads of the audience beneath. Then Mr. CHARLES
HALL* having played, as only Mr. CHABLES HALLE can play, WEBER'S
"Invitation a la Valse," bowed, and retired. Being vociferously
encored, he re-appeared, and. with the modesty of true genius,
evidently convinced that only his graceful bow had been encored, he
repeated that and once more disappeared. But the audience soon
enlightened him as to what they wanted, so he piano'd again, and
once more was vociferously applauded.
Then we had the "Presto and Finale of Haydn's Farewell
Symphony." To describe this, which literally brought down the
house, would require more space than is just now at our command.
How the musicians, one by one, blow out their candles and steal
away, how Mr. BURNETT is the last to go, how Mr. COWEN, with
his eyes like St. Anthony, "fixed on the old black book," i.e., the
score, still goes on conducting until a servant jogs his elbow, and
awakens him to the fact that he is in the situation of the last Rose
of Summer, left alone, while all his blooming companions have
slithered away and gone—all this, we say, must be seen to be appre-
ciated,—and, indeed, so marked was the success last Thursday that a
voiceless man (all part of the joke) came forward to announce, that,
in consequence of the immense success of the entertainment, he,
the voiceless man, had great pleasure in informing the audience,—
tho', personally, he had no voice in the matter,—that this " Humorous
Night" would be repeated on Tuesday. The voiceless one retired
bashfully amid cries of " Speak up I And then those quite close
to the platform who had been in the voiceless man's confidence all
along, told their neighbours what he had been saying, and so the
news spread. So great a success ought to be repeated more than once
before the end of the season, with some few changes in the programme.

A VERT SHADY SIDE OF PALL MALL.
THE superficial observer would suppose that this was
quite the principal street in London. It contains nearly
a dozen English palaces called Clubs, the price for a
back room on the third floor is seldom less than one
hundred a year, and the Prince of WALES lives_ at 65.
This ought to be enongh to give an aristocratic tone
to the street, but unfortunately it contains an Arcade—
an Opera Arcade—and since the " dark arches " of the
Adelphi have lost their popularity, this Arcade is the
chosen resort of the midnight tramp. A few ooffee-
stalls form what an advertiser would call an al fresco
caff, the steps under the columns are more comfortable
than a three-penny lodging-house, the well-paid cabmen,
on their way back from Pimlieo to Theobald's Road,
supply the " Swell" element, and the " pay " contingent
is represented by a few draggle-tailed female phantoms
whose language conies untranslated from Ratcliffe High-
way. Emboldened by the patronage of Club porters
and gentlemen's servants, these muddy Venuses and
their companions are very liberal in their attentions to
passers-by, and being so near Scotland Yard, they enjoy
a freedom from Police interference which would not be
accorded to them in Whitechapel. Perhaps, when the
Harley Street murder is discovered, and_ the _ Authorities
are not quite so over-worked, they will give a little
attention to the Bottom as well as to the Top of the
Gay-Market.

TIME was when English maids and wives
Led modest and secluded lives;
But in these latter days they vie
In seeking base publicity.
The face that once at home would shine—
The glory of the ancient line—
The lips, the sweetest under sun,
That in old days smiled but for one;
The eyes that veiled themselves always
Beneath the rude observer's gaze;
All these, if haply he be willing,—
The Cad can purchase for a shilling!

LOOKING FOE A SITE.
THE following communications (among thousands of others on the
same subject) have found their way into our letter-box :—
SIR,
NOTHING is easier than to find a new site for a Flower
and Vegetable Market. The Royal Commissioners for the Exhi-
bition of 1851 have never been able to utilise profitably a portion of
their land. Now is the time for seizing the opportunity of turning
their greatest incubus to good account.
In a sentence, why not send Mud Salad Market, with its unsavoury
etceteras, to the Gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society, South
Kensington? A PHILANTHROPIST.
SIB,
THE scandal of the hour (indirectly shared by all London)
affects us very much. Quite a number of carts, laden with vege-
tables, pass every night down the Kensington Road, within a few
hundred yards of our very windows! Send the Market to Bays-
water. There is a spot specially adapted to the purpose, close to a
house called The Retreat. A PBACTICAI MAN.
South Kensington (opposite the Horticultural Gardens).
SIR,
WILL you permit us to suggest an alternative site to that
at present occupied by Mud-Salad ^Market. The new Law Courts
are, from an architectural point of view, a disgrace to the Metropolis.
Surely they might be pulled down and the space utilised for the
erection of a commodious receptacle for fruit, flowers, and vegetables!
The stoppage in Fleet Street caused by the market carts, &o., would
not be much greater than that already arising from the erection of
the new granite substitute for Temple Bar.
We shall be very happy to take the matter in hand professionally,
and can guarantee a satisfactory result to all parties. Enclosing our
Business Card, we remain, Sir, your obedient servants,
Gothic Chambers, TUDOR, GABEL, & Co.,
Westminster. Architects.
SIR,
BY all means move Mud-Salad Market. It is easy enough
to find a site. Why not the grounds of Buckingham Palace, or the
Temple Gardens. What on earth can lawyers want with gardens?
Or the Zoo? If the beasts were allowed to remain, they would feel
quite at home in the general row and confusion. Or South Ken-
sington Museum? It is already full of curiosities, and the market
would be a valuable addition to the collection. Is the Thames
Tunnel large enough P It would be nice and cool in the summer.
Some of the City Companies would only be too happy to give up
their Halls for such a public benefit. They always are.

IMPORTANT TO YACHTSMEN.
AT the Royal Naval College, Greenwich, may be seen in the
grounds a model vessel, size of life, on which the boys are exercised
in the rigging, so that they mav not go to sea without knowing the
ropes. An excellent idea. But why not apply it to intending
Yachtsmen? Institute a first-class Yacht College. Keep Yachts of
various tonnage on the grounds. If the Yacht College is by the sea-
side, the fresh breezes and the sight of the ocean will obviate all
necessity of ever quitting shore. All the fun, none of the inconve-
niences, and scarcely any expense. The practising Yachtsman can
let his imagination, roam freely, and, as he generally does "fancy
himself" pretty considerably as being "all there," he can easily
fancy himself anywhere. By an arrangement with Mr. SAM MAT
of Bow Street, or Messrs. AUGUSTS & Cie., the Theatrical Cos-
tumiers—assisted by the eminent scenic Artist, Mr. BEVEBI.T, they
could wake up to find themselves in some different port every
morning, with new scenery, dresses, and appointments. Thist of
course, would add to the expense; but a well-organised Collegiate
System could manage the whole thing at a comparatively trifling
outlay. We make the Mem. at once, as it's just as well to yot it
down before it escapes our memory.

BACK to town and, egad, I 'm uncommonly glad
That my holiday outing is over,
For Old England's the spot after all. I '11 be shot
If my heart did not leap to see Dover!
They may prate as they please of a tour beyond seas,
And how minds are expanded by travel,
But give me the old town, though the trees are all brown,
And my house upon Kensington gravel.
It may simply be prejudice, yet I "ve oft said
That vour foreigner's rather repulsive;
For his language is queer, and he shouts in your ear
With contortions completely convulsive.
And I don't think he 'd mope if deprived of his soap,
Or would hold himself much of a martyr;
For his matutine tub seems reduced to a rub—
That is quite independent of water.
He can cook well enough, but the sauce-covered stuff
Might be anything—horseflesh or kitten,
And the joint 13 unknown, which wrings many a groan
From the beef-loving son of Great Britain.
But I 'm back now at last, and my troubles are past,
Though my baggage was cruelly undone;
It was very unfair, lor I 'd nought " to declare"
But my pleasure at landing in London!

LAST MEET OF THE SLOW COACH CLUB.
(By the " Veteran.")
TUT, last meet for the Season of the Slow Coaoh Club, of which his Grace the
Duke of MUDFOBD, E.G., is President, and the motto of which is " tarde veni-
entibus 'asset "—not ossa, as the fine old fruity saying has heen ridiculously
misquoted by a contemporary—took place on Monday last. It had originally
been intended to hold the meet in Mud-Salad Market; but, it having been
represented to the Committee, first, that the Market was not a meat one, but an
emporium for fruit and vegetables; and next, that the Slow Coaches might
interfere with the numerous waggons full of cabbages which form flying but-
tresses to the church of St. Paul, and help to prop up the colonnade of the
Piazza, it was agreed that the Slow Coaches should assemble at that delightful
expanse of greenery, Abney Park, which had been kindly placed at the disposal
of the Club by the late Sir THOMAS ABNEY.
Of course I went to see the start of the Slow Coaches. My fine old crusted
friend and ex-M.F.H., JEM POLEAXE, tooled me down to Abney Park in a
truly cemeterioal manner. JEM owned to me, with a racy smile on his way, that
he thought he could combine a little pleasure with the business of the day.
"For, d 'ye see," he observed, "there must be a tidy lot of good old rusty worn-
out screws at the meet, and I may see my way to bidding for a high-mettled
racer, ha! ha! or two." JEM'S humour is all banter and beeswing, and he has
moved in the very first circles.
So at a high, gee woa, yoieks! pace we sped to the Park; and with one
of WATLINO'S excellent pork-pies, a canful of PEEK and FREAN'S biscuits,
some Du BARBY'S Revalenta Arabica, and a glass or two of the celebrated Cock-
alorum Sherry (a natural wine; the vines are never plastered, but are carefully
polished every day with Nubian Blacking) under mv waistcoat, I felt as high
tol-lol frisky as a fox might feel with the whole Pytohley, Qnorn, and East
Nor-Nor- West-Northampton hounds at his heels, to say nothing of the Belhus
hunters, and the Babraham Rollicking Roaring Rams. Ah! for the grand
historic days, when my late lamented and fine old orusted friend, Sir HAHX-
AWAY GBIMSTONE EYESNUTF, Bart., used to hunt all three packs at once in a
ring-fence I How cleverly he would pass the Soap Works! IInw triumphantly
he would shoot the second arch of the Suspension Bridge,
on the Middlesex side, and foul a steam-launch, full
of Cockneys, hired at "The Eight Bells."*
It was open house and open cellar at Eye-snuff Hall.
'Twas there I met my dear old crony, SOAPY SPONGE, and
jolly old JORROCKS, and NIMROD, of the Quarterly, and
JEHU, and METHUSALEH, and all the old jovial set. And
TOM MOODY, the Whipper-in. You all knew him well.
Ehett ! fugaces. The quantity of "Comet," "twenty,"
and "forty-seven" port, ChateauMargaux, Pontet Canet,
GUINNESS s Stout, and the celebrated Cockalorum Sherry
(a natural wine, containing positively no acid) was some-
thing enormous.
We sat behind JEM'S fine old mare, Slack Be»s, that
beat Eclipie at the Derby, the Oodolphin Arabian at
Goodwood, the Cnffin Mare at the Leger, and the Flying
Dutchman at the Whetstone Park Handicap in the
days when I was getting my earliest lessons in things
horsey, by being horsed at St. Broomback's Charity
School. JEM drove me in a gig, of the regular bang-
up, stay-for-nothing, rumtumtiddity order—which has
recently been repaired by those excellent carriage-makers,
Messrs. SPRING, DICKEY, and SQUAB, of 910, Song Acre.
We found a rare gathering of the regular old 'uns at
the Park—fine old tawny Britons after my dear old friend
Sir JOSEPH HAWLEY'S own heart. None of your yawning,
lisping, crutch-and-toothpick calibre, but jolly dogs of
the Lord GEOBGE BENTINCK calibre, fine old mellow
bucks of the Admiral Rous type. There were several
Old Masters distinguished for theirpictures of fox-hunts.
There was Old FULLER (a most worthy Corinthian), Old
BURTON (who looked rather! Melancholy), Old DAN
TUCKER, Old JOE (who would persist in kicking up
behind and before), Old Dr. JACOB TOWNSHEND, and Old
PAKE. You may be sure that my brother veterans and
I attentively scanned the drags and the prads and the
bang-up old nobs who held the ribbons. There were
twenty Slow Coaches at the meet; but perhaps the palm
both for superiority of horseflesh and vehicular elegance
must be awarded to my noble friend, Captain the Honour-
able VELVET PAUL SHILLTBEER, whose tasteful equipage,
drawn by four magnificently-matched black Flemish
horses, with long manes and tails, and superb action,
excited general admiration.
Through an odd fancy of Captain SHTLLIBEER, he has
trained his grooms to sit, not in the dickey, but on the
roof of the drag, with their legs swinging at large; and
this, combined with the singular uniformity of redness
in their noses, produces a very spirited effect. Captain
MUFF got his little lot clubbed with Mr. STREATHAM
COMMON'S invalid team, Farcy, Olanders, Spasms, and
Shouldershotten, and Sir HECTOR O'DEAH had a bad
spill in endeavouring to get his highly attractive con-
tingent (Dutch pinks) into line. But, on the whole, the
form was superb. Not a galled jade but winced. Not a
wither but was wrung. Not a fetlock but was sprung.
1 never saw a creamier show of "fiddle-case "heads and
"star-gazers." They were all roarers. Drooping flanks,
sparkling hooks. CULLETON'S crests, puff- pasterns,
oyster-barrels, asthmatic crops, victoria docks, strangled
stifle-joists, hundred-ton cannon bones, and stony curb-
places:—all the points of the Perfect Horee were distri-
buted among this peculiarly cheery high-toned and
down-the-road lot. The Admiral would have wept, and
Sir JOSEPH would have danced a high, gee woa, tantivy
to see the show.
The whips, having been all thoroughly awakened by
the Club "Knocker Up." snuffed all round to make
themselves lively, and tooled away in fine style to Kensal
Green, where they were to dine. Your correspondent,
after filling his box with some right Macabaw (SNEEZUM'S,
in Great Catechu Street, is the only place where you
can get genuine Macabaw), adjourned to TOM TICK'S
genial hostelry, the "Slate and Chalk," and there JF.M
and I refreshed ourselves with a chop, supplied to the
establishment by those highly respectable butchers,
Messrs. BLOCK AND ORNAMRNT, of Hackney Coach
Marshes, and a glass or two of the celebrated Cocka-
lorum Sherry (a natural wine, with never a headache in
a dozen of it). Then, hey for TATTKHSALL'S! Ontui ><•

Eighty years! A green old age

LATEST FROM THE FLEET.

Gravosa, Sept. ZOth.—United European Fleet a-lying at anchor.
I take supreme command to-day. Proud position! Would be
prouder, if I knew what I am expected to do, or how to do it.
We 're all safe in harbour at present, however. Perhaps I ought
to inspirit the various crews by a striking theatrical coup.
"demonstrate."
Have just done it. The coup didn't come off quite. I first ordered
Band to play the different national anthems in turn. They began
with " Marseillaise." German Admiral came on board, furious, to
know why I hadn't begun with the " Wacht am Rhein." I told him
Band shouldn't play again, and sent him back pacified. Second
part of coup was, signalling (a la NELSON) to the other ships—
Europe expects every man to do his duty." French Admiral sig-
nalled back—"What is my duty? May I telegraph to Paris to
inquire?" Russian and German Admirals have sent to ask what I
meant, as they use—it seems—a different code of signals. Austrian
Admiral took it for order to—" Weigh anchor, and sail port," while
Italian Admiral thought it was—" Ditto, ditto, and sail starboard."
Result—Bad collision between Austrian and Italian Ironclads.
Austrian and Italian Admirals have just come on board. Both
accuse each other of causing collision intentionally. I make long
speech of very soothing character. At end, find they neither of
them understand English. Happy Thought.—Demonstrate. I do so.
Admirals much pleased. They 've retired.
Sept. 23rd. On the way to Dulcigno.—Another dispute between
French and German Admirals. Both come on board, using what I
take to be German and French bad language. Demonstrate again.
Very violent exercise this demonstrating. Result satisfactory.
Happy Thought.—Have settled French and German dispute by
ordering French band to play " Wacht am Rhein" and German band
to play " Marseillaise " till told to stop.
Sept. 25th. Off Dulcigno.—PA last! Wretehed little place: not
half as big as Herne Bay. Had greatest difficulty in getting my
happy family so far. Got 'em here now, however. Demonstrate from
the quarter-deck. Three Albanians on shore, apparently much in-
terested. I have demanded surrender, in name of United Europe.
They reply in Albanian, so can't make out exactly what they say,
but it sounds something like "United Europe be blowed I" RIZA
PASHA encamped on one side of town, five thousand Montenegrins
on other side; we in the harbour. Why doesn't RIZA PASHA storm
the place? Says he has orders not to use force. So have we!
Why don't Montenegrins storm place? Call them " the most heroic
race in Europe "! Pooh! The three Albanians have disappeared.
Demonstrate once, and to bed.
Next Day.—Have again demanded surrender. French Admiral
just come on board. Feels nervous. Is he sea-sick? He says
"No; but should like to telegraph to Paris." I ask, "What on
earth about?" He replies, that "he was ordered to steam away
directly offensive operations began, and he isn't sure whether Alba-
nians won't consider the demand to surrender offensive." Demon-
strate to him that he 'B ail wrong. He admits it, and calls for the
Steward.
Have just sent deputation to Montenegrins to ask when they are
going to begin. Curiously enough, they nave also sent a deputation
asking when we are going to begin. I tell them they are the most
heroic race in Europe, and it's ooviously their business more than
ours.
Still later.—Albanians have begun to fire at us! One shot cer-
tainly was fired I What can they mean? Are they demonstrating?
Ask 'em by signal. No answer. Idiots.
Mystery explained. Russian Admiral and crew have been engaged
in making faces at the Albanians over the sides of their ships.
This has irritated Albanians. Query.—Do Russians want another

fools the Albanians are to mind Russians making faces
at them!
On shot being tired, French vessels have steamed away!
Russian Admiral come on board. Says, "Must retali-
ate." &o. Wish GLADSTONE had come here in Grantully.
Sept. 26.—Ultimatum. Everybody demonstrating. No

WEARY WOMANKIND!
THREE weary young women of London town
Sent up their thoughts when they went to rest:
A Slattern was one, in her greasy old gown,
And a Mother another, wnose kindly breast
Had soothed the screams of a fractious child
That had beat at her heart and her brains all day,
And the third was a Seamstress, lean and mild
Though weary—these women had something to say.
The Slattern she owned she was weary of JACK,
Good fellow, no doubt! but whose curious ways
Were impressed on his wife by some weala on her back
And by terrible bruises—well, under her stays;
And she thought on this night would she ever get rid
Of a man who when drunk didn't care how she fed.
She 'd been true to the fellow, and did as he bid,
So the heart-broken Slattern crept into her bed.
The Mother was weary, for half of that day
She 'd been bearing her burden from door unto door;
No woman may rest on Her Majesty's way,
But now her poor babe was asleep on the floor,
So she thought, this sad mother, " Will weariness end
By starving, or prison, or how will it be?
I haven't a penny, she sighed, "or a friend!"
Still she slept, and determined the morrow to see.
The poor little Sewing-Girl, weary of course
With the whirl of the wheel, the machinery's click,
She 'd the strength of a mouse and the work of a horse,
And the child was so quiet she hadn't a kick!
So she said, "It don't matter, for many, worse off,
Cannot cling to the wheel for support, and must die."
But before she could sleep she remembered the scoff
Of girls whose smart feathers attracted her eye.
Now, would you believe it? When all were asleep
And the woes of all womenkind seemed at an end,
That a cry just as bitter and sighs quite as deep
Went up to humanity, seeking a friend
For the prettiest girl that the mind could depict,
With the neatest of dresses and softest of hair,
Her waist it was slender, her conduct was strict,
But beneath her blue eyes was the black of despair.
"I am weary!" she said; "on my honour it's true,
Though I 've spent all the day amidst ribbons and lace.
My sisters! your fashions are pleasant to you—
They are torture to us! 'Tis a sin, a disgrace
That you sit at the counter all day and you fuss.
Our task is to stand, your delight is to shop.
It's the joy of your lives, but it's death unto us—
You are nardest to please when we 're ready to drop.
"It wasn't our fault that our fathers have failed
At home, at the farm, or the forge, or the mill,
But you 've got us all fast, at the counter we 're nailed,
Like the dubious coin that was saved from the till.
We are modest I Who dares to deny it? We try
To be women as good as you see we are neat;
But we stand all the day, and are ready to die,
Till we drag to our rest with our weary young feet.
"Tis easy to scoff, but more tedious far
To smile and look merry from eight unto ten,
And the school of the shop and the counter and bar
Doesn't teach us good lessons of women or men!"
So the Slattern, the Mother, the Sewing-Girl slight,
Dropped off into dreams about toil and the town;
But the weariest woman who slept that night
Was the fair-haired girl with the neat black gown I
THE REAL SUBSTITUTE FOE BUTTER.—Hunger.

SMALL BY DEGREES"
"MAYN'T I HAVE SOME MORE SCOAB IN MY TBA, AUNT GEORGY?"
"WHY, YOU 'VE HAD THRZE 1"
"YKS ; BUT THEY MELT AWAY so!"
THE MEMORIAL OBSTRUCTION.
LAST week the attention of those mighty Archons, the Common Councilmen,
was drawn to the New Temple Bar Memorial, which Mr. STEVENSON rightly
denounced as "a mighty obstruction." Whereupon, Mr. BEDFORD, the people's
real friend in Epping Forest, but not at Temple Bar, spoke up for the Obstruction,
and finished by saying—
"The Memorial would do credit to the Corporation aa a work of Art, and it would also
mark their ancient boundary. The Press had taken up this matter, as they sometimes did,
without understanding what they were writing about, whereas if they would only have
taken the trouble to measure the roadway, they would have discovered that with the
Memorial it was as wide again as it was before."
Oh, "they do not know everything down in Judee," don't they? The City
objects to the Press, the Press objects to the squash,—as squash there's sate
to be. If the only object of the Memorial be to " mark their ancient boundary,"
why not let a Memorial Tablet into the wall by CHILDS' Bank, or a splendid
Brass representing the LORD MAYOR and Corporation. The metal is cheap
enough, and plenty of it, in the City.
Votes in Vienna.
A VIENNESE beauty, a forward young Miss,
T'other day, it appears, won a vote by a kiss:
But the law 'gainst corruption is terribly strong,
And 'tis said she '11 be made to repent it ere long.
What becomes of the kiss? Since the voter dared earn it,
In justice one hopes he '11 be made to return it.

CONCERT.
BASS BOTTLED BY Q. A. S.
in,—In last week's
"Echoes "the
following
suggestion
was made by
"G. A. 8."
"In the case
of a quiet
street, where a
difference of
opinion touch-
ing itinerant
minstrelsy ex-
ists, why should
not the resid-
onta be polled,
nd if there be
a two - thirds
majority a-
gainst the
brown aliens
from Leather
Lane, and the
German 'green
baize' bands,
and so forth, why should not the parish authorities (under an amended Act of
Parliament, of course) be empowered to affix, in a conspicuous position at the
corners of each street, enamelled iron tablets, bearing the inscription, in
Italian, German, and English, ' No Street Music Allowed Here,' and specify-
ing beneath, the amount of hue or imprisonment, «r both, to which a street-
musioian, playing in that street, would be liable if he persisted in playing
after a first warning."
Now, Sir, I may tell you that I live in a quiet street, consisting of
four houses; some people call it a square, or a court, or even a blind
alley. But we are all highly respectable inhabitants. Being a quiet
street, the average amount of noise we endure from morning till
night would supply a Monster Concert for a month.
Uuiet is indispensable to me, being engaged in literary pursuits, so
I polled our street as directed by " 6. A. 8.," and here is the result.
No. 1.
Singcon Snood (myself). Don't want street music.
Mrs. Sinacon Snood (my W\fe). Let the poor things earn a living.
I am sure they don't interfere with your rubbishing Greek.
Wellington Rhode Singcon Snontl (my Son). Anything is better
than ACACIA'S eternal " Sweethearts' Waltz."
Cicada Rhode 8ingcon Snood (my Daughter), A million German
bands are better than a brother learning the flute.
Jemima (my Cook). It do cheer the depressed heart up do a bit of
music.
Anna (my Housemaid). They plays just like a Circus, and Circuses
No. 2.
is eaven.
Miss Flapper (Spinster). They should be put down, as they make
my pug howl.
Harriet (her Housemaid). Their melodies is frivolous and not
improving. Away with them I
June (her Cook). To think of a policeman admiring one of those
Italian-Irish organ-grinding huzzies, instead of taking them all to
prisonl No. 3.
Mr. Baldhead (Widower). Put them down, by all means, and give
everybody who encourages them six months on the treadmill.
John Baldhead (his Son). If Mrs. WEATHERBY will wring her
infernal parrot's neck, he will vote against them.
Servants. Have no opinions, and are not likely to have, in BALD-
HEAD'S house. JT ,
Mrs. Weatherby (Widow). Unless JOHN BALDHEAD will leave off
coming hume at three in the morning, singing music-hall songs, and
shouting like a maniac, she will vote for them.
Servants. I should like to know what the value of my Servants'
opinions is on the subject.
Now, my dear Sir, will you kindly notice in what position, owing
to "G. A. S."'s brilliant suggestion, we stand:—For Organs, 5;
against Organs, 5; neutral, 2; neither for, against, nor neutral, 4.
A street once tolerably happy, is now pandemonium. When an
organ or a band arrives, my household is delighted, and asks me
about the poll. Mr. BALDHEAD sends me an indignant message,
Miss FLAPPER asks whether I have treated her with the courtesy
due to her station in life. Mrs. WEATHERBY and JOHN BALDHEAD
now cut each other dead, and me too. The servants on either side
tell frantic fictions of each other's masters and mistresses to the
tradespeople. The once happy family is a bear-garden.
I bear no malice to " G. A. S." Let him come and live here.
CORSICAN BROTHERS & CO. (LIMITED).
At the Lyceum.
WHEN it was first intimated to the theatre-going Public that
Mr. IRVING, in an ecstasy of inspiration, had exclaimed, "Happy
Thought! Revive the Corsican Brothers!" everybody young
enough to remember its first success at the Princess's under CHARLES
KEAN, said to everybody else, "Capital notion! Just the thing for
IRVING! Safe to be a big success!'
If the question had been asked, "Why is it safe to be a big suc-
cess?" the answer would have been, "Oh, mysterious—weird—
ghost-like, you know—IRVING all over."
Exactly: that's all it amounted to. Pale face, attenuated frame,
and thin legs settled the question. He must he a Coraican Brother's
ghost; and so he became a Corsican
Brother's ghost, and has produced the
piece with "New Scenery, Dresses,
and Appointments," and, we are bound
to add, "dis-appointments." Not,
however, as far as Mr. IRVING individu-
ally is concerned. The little he has to
do he does thoroughly well. His
Fabien—Farbbyang as they call it at
the Lyceum, the healthy Corsiaan Twin,
is artistically contrasted with Louis,
who, in the Second Act, appears to
have come to the Sal Masque at the
Grand Opera made up as A if red Jingle,
or "Dismal Jemmy." If he had only
got a GIHARD to double" him and
dance in this scene, that would have
drawn all London!
In spite of its having been cogitated
over for so long a time, there is an
utter lack of novelty in the stage-business. When Farbbyang
is about to inflict a long story on his acquaintance, M. Alfred
ftfeynard—-mho looks like Nicholas Nickleby on a tour—he says,
"From my brother's friend / have no secret; you shall know
»11;" and then he tells him his brother's secret—a most unwar-
rantable breach of confidence, by the way—commencing, "Three
hundred years ago" — whereupon they both seat themselves,
and M. Meynard does his best politely to show that "the story
interests him much." Then there was the old ghost-music, and there
was the inevitable sliding-trap, which created such a sensation till
we knew how it was done; and there was the "Double," looking
uncommonly like a cheap tailor's dummy, but being in reality,
Mr. ARTHUR MATHISON, who having been saved from the wreek
in The World, at Drnry Lane, is now able to appear as somebody
else's ghost at the Lyceum. But this talented gentleman, Actor,
Singer, and Composer, having been selected for toe part, why did
Mr. IRVING lose such a splendid chance for a new line in the bill as—

Ghost of Louis (with a Song)
Mr. ABIHTJK MATHISON.
He could have put words to the fine old Ghost melody, and
have sung it himself. "And is Old Double dead?" No, he
isn't, but all alive, oh, at the Lyceum!
Then again, instead of the Ghost
coming from below, he should have
been let down as a surprise from
above. Since the sliding-trap was
invented we have had the sliding-
roof, and the ghost could have come
down flop on Farbbyang, and
startled him in real earnest. Here,
again, a GLRARD would have been
useful, suddenly swooping down,
from "the flies," by some such
mechanical arrangement as set
Mile. yENEA flying noiselessly about
at the Gaiety. Everyone expected
something new in ghosts; and
everyone was disappointed. Alas!
AVhen that old ghost was new,
Life wore a roseate hue,
And we were boys together. The
truth is, The Corsican Brothers is a bad piece, depending on
certain effects, which should be novel and startling or they are
nothing. The dialogue is flat, and there is no relief to the gloom.
except the episode of the hen, which is tedious from being lugged
in to spin out the Act with a little local colouring.
KEAN as the Twins, WIGAN or WALTER LACY as Chdteau-
Renaud, JULIA MURRAY as the dignified lay-figure Emily, and
fascinating CABLOTTA LECLERCQ as the chief of the ladies at the
supper-party, carried the piece triumphantly, when "that old ghost

Jnew,"|—,'and, 'perhaps,, such a cast might do so
once;more."? But now the;supper-scene is as dull as
such things mostly are in
real life—and so far is to be
praised as holding the mirror
up to nature.
Mr. TERISS as Chateau-
Renaud, is as weak as he
was as Captain Hawksley.
He hasn't done much since
the wicked young Squire in
Olivia.
The Bal Masque Scene is
very good, bar the immovable
figures in the upper boxes,
who look as if Madame
TUSSAUD had taken her wax-
works out for a night's treat
to the Grand Opera, and left
them there. The brilliancy
of the Scene is marred by the stupidity of the dances,
the mechanical movements, the laughter "to order," and
the dulness of the music. Everyone, however, knew the
fight was coming, and that that was to be the event of
the evening.
It came, and was the event of the evening. Then, after
the duel, Furbbyang overcome with grief, leaning on
Meynard, disappears behind a tree (old business), and
immediately afterwards Mr. MATHISON, The Double,
without a song, deeply affected ("Double, double, toil
and trouble"—it is hard work), and leaning still more
heavily on poor Meynard, appears, while Sir. IRVIHG
makes a dive below and a rush for the sliding-trap.
Mr. MATHISON is not quite Mr. IRVING'S "Double;"
he is only his "Half-as-much-again."
By the way, Mr. BOT/-
CICATTLT makes Farb-
byang say, "The dead
travel fast"—which is
about the one good line
in the piece — (only,
where did it come from ?)
—but this is not borne
out by facts, as Louis's
ghost slides along as
slowly and gravely as
Mr. Pickwick when he
assisted in keeping "the
pot a-bilin'," and re-
presents rather the pace
of a Parliamentary train
than an express.
We suppose the Cor-
iican Brothers Sf Co.
will be a success, though
not the success expected. The costumes being all of the
Nicholas Nickleby period, when Sir Mulberry Hawk
and Lord Verisopht were men about town, might sug-
gest the notion to Mr. TOOLE—(why didn't he play
Chateau-Renaud f)—of producing The Cheeryble Bro-
thers at the Folly. Well —may Mr. IRVING'S shadow
never grow le_ss; and may he, at all events, be
thoroughly satisfied with the ultimate result of the
Corsican Brothers Sf Co. (Limited).
Theatrical Mem.—Mr. CHARLES WARNER has given
up Drink, and taken to the Wells. This is natural
enough, and we hope he '11 be re- CowpeoM'dfor his change.
The Sadler's Wells people are great patrons of "The
Bard." Their motto is that "Bard's the Best." So
Mrs. BATEMAN is quite right to give it them strong. But
is Mr. WABNER as Othello, with such an lago as Mr.
VEZIN, quite strong enough as yet f Mr. WARNER pro-
bably recollects the legend of the Super, who on being
given a line to speak, slapped his forehead and exclaimed,
"more study!" In going in f9r SHAKSPEAHE, Mr.
CHARLES WARNER may adopt as his motto and his rule
these two words, "MoreJStudy!"
Apropos " de Boots," our CLARKE of the Weather has
consulted the Barometer, re-opened the Haymarket, and
re-appeared as his old friend the Major with Ms usual
success.
WHY is the discovery of the North Pole like an
illicit Whiskey manufactory?—Because it's a secret
still.

An Asinine Error.
AMONG intelligence from Paris a telegram the other day announced that,—
"VICTOR HUGO will, on the Fifteenth of October, publish a poem entitled Z'Ant."
This production might have been expected to be a work of genius dealing
with political, moral, and social problems, from what, to the stolid, common
understanding, would probably appear an asinine point of view. Wags might
have suggested that the groundwork of the story under which the purpose and
meaning of L'Ane had been veiled by its distinguished author was taken from
the once popular and still sufficiently celebrated English idyl, "If I had a
Donkey wot wouldn't go." But Ane turns out to have been a misprint in the
Rappel for Ame, which makes a material—not to say immaterial—difference.

Captain. "WHAT'S THE CHABGE, SKKOBANT?"
Sergeant. "THIS TIMX IT'S DRUNKENNESS, SIB. BUT THIS MAS is TEK MOST TROUBLESOME FELLOW m THE REUIMKNT, SIR.

THE DUKE OF MUDFORD AND BUMBLEDOM.
THBHE is a bond of sympathy between Dukes and Beadles which
is not altogether for the public interest. The Duke of MUDFOBD is
not only allowed to fatten upon Mud-Salad Market, but he is allowed
this privilege on cheaper terms than his neighbours. He is rated
with the lightest possible parochial touch. He is allowed the free
use of dozens of so-called "thoroughfares," and for his Market
proper he is put down at the far too moderate assessment of £10,000
a year, with an additional £1200 a-year for the new Flower Market.
Ills theatres are favoured by the local authorities to an almost equal
extent. The huge area of Drury Lane Theatre is only rated at a
few more annual pounds than the Gaiety Theatre, which is less than
half its size, ana Covent Garden Theatre, with its vast annexe,
culled the Floral Hall, is equally a pet of the parish. These two
colossal properties are put upon nearly an exact equality with the
little Vaudeville, the smaller Olympic, and the smallest Strand.
The humour—the practical fun—of Bumbledom does not end here.
The Lyceum is rated at nearly £500 a-year less than the Gaiety,
though it is practically half as large again, and the Globe and the
Opera Comique are let off, for some mysterious reason, for little
more than half the rates levied on the Olympic and the Vaudeville,
though their holding capacity is just double. The Adelphi is
scarcely fairly treated by being assessed at nearly three times the
amount levied on the Opera Comique or the Globe, as it can hardly
claim to be more than a fourth larger than these houses.
There is a grim pleasure in drawing the attention of Theatrical
Managers to these beauties of parochial taxation. The new assess-
ments have just been made, and the old assessments were more
unequal still. There is no appeal, and nothing can be altered for
the next five years. Such is tine elasticity of Local Self-Government.
Music AND DANCING.—The European Concert seems likely to end
with a Breakdown.
A HOME SWEET HOME SECRETARY.
SIB W. V. HABCOUBT will earn his title to be considered a genuine
"English Home " Secretary, if he only succeeds in dealing summarily
with juvenile offenders, whose conduct ultimately wrecks the happi-
ness of so many homes. The thoughtless lad, who should be whipped
soundly, is now made a gaol-bird. The first committals, writes
Sir WILLIAM V. HABCOUBT in the Times—
"are for comparatively trivial offences. Children of ages between nine
and thirteen go to prison for throwing stones, breaking windows, playing at
pitch-and-toss, obstructing thoroughfares, bathing in canals, threatening
people, common assaults, trampling down grass, &<•,., though, of course, many
of the committals are for more serious offences, which yet in children of such
tender years are of a very different dye from similar crimes when committed
by persons of riper age."
And soon afterwards he hints at a simple remedy :—
"It seems clear that the existing restrictions on committals to industrial
schools, and on the employment of a moderate personal chastisement for small
offences us a substitute for imprisonment require to be reconsidered."
"Moderate personal chastisement 1 "—that is what it must come
to. And Mr. Punch's commentary on it is his present Cartoon.
"Vulgar Venice."
IN Venice the echoes of TA.SSO no more,
As Lord BTBON remarked, can be heard by the shore.
And now, from the latest reports, it appears
We shall soon see the last of the gay Gondoliers;
For steamboats will ply by each palace and fane,
And KUSKIN will greet them with savage disdain;
At FLOBIAN'S still we shall lounge, but, ah me 1
We shall scarce know the City that sits on the Sea.
GOOD NEWS.—The man who was under a cloud has got over it.

CHAPTER XVII.
THE BISHOP'S CHABOE.
NDOMITABLE in
courage, an<
panting fo
the fray, Mrs
DOWDLE ad-
vanced to the
writing-table
"Now, Bi-
shop, tell m
what's been
going on here
Why is this
most disrepu-
table person
still in your
entire confi-
dence?"
The Bishop
was silent
He had stooc
patiently and
placidly; but,
like cream, he
had stood too
long, and was
now begin-
ning to turn;
and, when he
did turn, he
felt he would
be uncom-
"Perhaps," commenced Mr. MATTIX, "if I might"
"You mightn't," retorted the infuriated dame. "Now, Bishop, are you
going to turn this person out, or not f" inquired the indignant dame.
. There was a dead pause in the room. How long it had been there it was
impossible to say, for it was only at this minute that the three became aware of
it. And the Bishop sniffed uncomfortably, as though there were something
wrong with the drainage. He sat on his chair twiddling his thumbs, and
wishing that the two would fight it out there and then, like two evil Genii
and^leave him to benefit by the result.
"Do you know, Bishop, how this person," and she pointed with infinite
contempt and aversion to Mr. MATTIX, "has been going on with the female
who calls herself the Marchesa di ZAZZEGLIA?"
"The Bishop is in full possession of the facts, Mrs. DOWDLE," said Mr.
MATTIX.
"Is this true?" asked the Bishop's wife, facing her husband.
«. ¥?*•• D°WDI?>" interrupted Mr. MATTIX, humbly. "His Lordship, like
the Admiral in the ballad of WILLIAM TAYLOB, 'has wery much applauded
what I ve done,' and with his sanction and his smile on my work I am happy"

Kebeilion, flat rebellion, or rather upstanding rampant rebellion stirring up
the Bishop on his throne, and rearing her hideous head in the Cathedral City of
bmall-Beerjester! If Rebellion were allowed to rear her hideous head in the city,
she would soon rear the hideous heads of a hundred communistic offspring
as plenty as asparagus, springing up from the ground in the night, like funei'
within the very walls of the Palace itself I
"Mr. MATTIX," said the Lady, with slow and dignified voice, measuring
out her words as if they were verses at so much a foot, "I beg you will take
your notice to quit from me. You are too much a caricature of a man yourself
tor me to ask you to take yourself off. But I order you to go."
The Chaplain felt that everything depended on the Bishop's firmness. If the
Bishop could cut himielf adrift from his apron-string moorings, hoist the flag
of freedom, and set sail on his own See before his mate could launch out, the
wind would bear them away, and the victory would be gained at a single blow.
(i Leave the room!" said Mrs. DOWDIE, imperiously.
_' If I go I shall certainly not take the room with me," returned the Chaplain
eyeing his patron uneasily.
"My Lord," exclaimed the exasperated Lady, "is Mr. MATTIX to quit, or
In making it a question of quits, Mrs. DOWDIE was wrong. A drawn battle
was as much out of the question as a painted one on canvass. It was real
deadly war. She was boiling over with wrath. Up to this moment the husband
of her choice had answered very well; now he wouldn'1
answer at all. All compromise wag impossible. It would
not do for Dr. DOWDIB to discharge the Canon at th«
enemy's request; that was to waste powder and shot,
He had one strategic movement at command, which he
had never yet employed against his better half. Quick
as thought he opened a drawer and took thence a volu-
minous and clearly printed pamphlet, which he folded
up like a Field-Marshal's baton, and waving it wUdlj
above his head he dashed forward at his luckless spouse.
Horrified at the sight. Mrs. DOWDLE turned ashen pale,
and placing hsr hands to her ears, fled precipitately
through the open door which the Canon immediately
locked behind her. Having done this, he turned to
examine the weapon the Bishop had used with such
marvellous effect. One glance at the title-page sufficed
—it was His Lordship's Charge.
"Up, Guards, and at 'em I" exclaimed the Bishop,
throwing himself back in his chair. "It was Waterloo
over again I"
"Charge, CHESTEB, charge!" cried the Chaplain,
exultingly.
"And I did—rather." said the Bishop; "it broke
the enemy thoroughly."
"A splendid charge!" cried the Chaplain; and then
they sang together, "Suoni la Tromba" from / Puri-
tani,
The battle was won. Now all they had to do was to
make the best use of their victory befere the enemy
repulsed, routed, beaten at every point, and utterly
demoralised, could steal a marsh upon them. Capua
and Cannaj are close together; and a victory may be
the prelude to a total defeat. Mrs. DOWDIE has not
been portrayed in these pages as an agreeable or an
amiable Lady; and no page in her family history that
I 've seen in the Palace would give her a better character
than I have done. She retired to her boudoir, and
looked out of her window at her laurels, which had
suffered considerably in the recent storm. Should she
summon allies to her aid? If so, whom? Who was
there in Small-Beerjester but would rejoice at her fall?
She had offended the Archbeaoon and Mrs. OVEHWAYTE
bringing forward Mr. MATTIX as a Candidate for
SIMON SLMPLEH'S Mastership of Deedler's. But
by
Mr
Mr. SIMPLER still held it. Then she had intended her
rusband's Chaplain for the Precentorship; but Mr.
IHABLE was now comfortably installed in that position.
HOBLEENA hated her, because she thought that Mr.
HATTIX had been incited by Mrs. DOWDIE to pay her
lis odious addresses. Doubtless Mr. ABABLE held the
same views. And how was she to call on her former
snemies for help to expel her husband's Chaplain from
ler own Palace 'f
Had I the pen of an Epic Poet, I might possibly do
ome justice to the struggle now raging in Mrs. DOWDIE'S
ireast; but I have not, and so will content myself, and
trust my readers also, by simply informing them that
at this minute, as Dido DOWDIE sits disconsolate at her
'alace-gate, "a darning a hole in her stocking, 01" there
.ppear on the war-path no less a personage than the
Lrchbeacon of Small-Beerjester accompanied by Mrs.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
The Tower.
SEEHTG that Mr. Secretary CHILDEBS had announced that he had
•visited the Tower with " so much pleasure and instruction that he
proposed giving even greater facilities to the Public to inspect the
National Collection." I thought (wishing also to be amused and in-
structed) that I could not do better than follow the Right Honourable
Gentleman's example.
I consequently arrived on a Saturday or Monday (at any_ rate, it was
a free day) at half-past ten o'clock, and took my place in an enor-
mous crowd which had been mar-
shalled by strong detachments of
the Police and the Military, with
the assistance of strong posts and
heavy chains, into a tail of about a
quarter of a mile long. We moved
up to the Entrance-Lodge by de-
tachments of thirty. The two or
three hours consumed in this slow
march gave ample time for the care-
ful inspection of a huge chimney
in the precincts of the Tower, which
seemingly was supposed by the less
washed of our number to be con-
nected with a furnace used for
ilHiaiCiiSHBncMflllMiSrJK* cremating Beef-Eaters. No doubt
nWfflwW rlilMKKlJl tne ™8h was father to the thought,
l/XirajillrJMSflrall as Her Majesty's Yeomen of the
Guard appeared to be on the worst
possible terms with certain] members
of the Public.
On entering, I found that the Authorities, evidently foreseeing
the inner man would require nourishment after a three hours' wait,
had prepared a Refreshment-stall for me. The edibles consisted of
Bath-buns, sweet-stuff, and the cheap edition of Mr. AIKSWOBTH'S
Tower of London; the drinkables of several ginger-beer bottles in a
washing-tub, and two or three mysterious wines," one of which,
no doubt to honourably distinguish it from the rest, was proudly
labelled "Grape." With a view, however, to discourage a wild
orgie bifore the Public had received instruction, and yet with a nice
feeling for the interests of trade, a placard over the counter bore the
inscription—" Visitors can return for refreshment after visiting the
Armouries." I had just made a note of this seductive invitation,
when I was carried by the stream out of the Lodge into the open
air, after a Warder who was wearing an undress uniform strongly
suggestive of a " more-than-usually Pretty Page."
"'E 's got on a Tarn O'Shanter 'at," whispered a Lady at my
elbow. Then she added, as she regarded, for the last time, the
waiting and expectant multitude, " I see why (they 'ave only two
free days in a week. The whole lot of 'em would shirk their work
and come if they 'ad more."
The Warder gazed sternly at the would-be Protectress of the
Commerce of London, and pointed at the moat with his umbrella.
"This," said he, in a quick undertone, "in times o' war is filled
with water and mud!" This piece of "information " was received
with a respectful " Law!" and we hurried on. The Warder walked
rapidly a dozen paces, and brought us up with a jerk. "Portcullis!"
he said, sharply, and the visitors gazed about them hungrily, as if
they were looking for something good to eat. Immediately we were
on again. "Bell Tower," he jerked out—" 'Es-E-BY THE EIGHTH
-Prison!"
At this, some of the least wealthy of the Public for a moment
paused, and appeared rather ill at ease. Finding, however, that
they were not to be taken into custody, they plucked up courage and
followed their guide, who was already out of sight.
"Traitor's Gate," he was saying, as they came up with him.
•' Entrance to the Tower from the Thames. That's the Thames!"
We were one and all delighted with this, and stared at the river
as if we had never seen it in our lives before. The Warder turned
sharply round and said, with gusto, "This is the Bloody Tower,
where the Royal children was murdered."
The information was received with acclamation. Our guide
stopped in the trot he had resumed, for a moment, to exclaim, '' See
them 'inges—all that remains of the 'riginal gate."
We all fought to examine the " 'inges;" but he was off again,
and before we could get breath to murmur " Jack Robinson,' we
were across a yard, up some stone steps, past a staircase, and into
the Horse Armoury. The Warder paused for a moment, but only
for a moment. Then he commenced a sort of disjointed lecture, in a
rapid mumble, of which I could only catch a word here and there,
although I listened most intently, However, I made out the names
of "the Earl of Hessex," "Kat-e-rhyne of Angeroo," "Count Odi
the Fiddler," and one or two other equally rare historical parsonages.
I heard one sentence, however, in its entirety. "This Prince," said

he, "died about eighteen, although he was not in battle,"—which
seemed to imply that the favourite infantile complaint of the Fifteenth
Century (when the croup and "teething" were unknown), was a
malignant attack of warfare.
For the rest, the Golden Rule of our guide, in dealing with any
perplexing article of historical interest, seemed to be, "When in
doubt;, say it was found in
the Spanish Armada." But
it is only just to admit that
he was very conscientious on
one point. He never passed
a suit of mail without point-
ing at it with his umbrella,
and tolling us to an ounce
the weight of the armour.
This being the case, it was
only natural that the Public
should take in one idea
firmly. This idea (I am
afraid it was the only one)
found expression at the con-
clusion of the discourse upon the Hone Armoury, in a universal
murmur, "Oh lawks! Ain't they 'eavy!"
And now we had pulled up, exhausted, to examine the instruments
of torture. Here the Warder became more intelligible, and gave us
quite a little Polytechnic lecture upon the working of the thumb-
screws, with practical illustrations. But the appearance of another
party with another Warder, at the other end of the gallery, started
him off again like a frightened hare. We hurried past Queen
Elizabeth, sneering at us from a wooden horse, rushed by some
assegais, tumbled up a staircase, and were brought to anchor in a
long, narrow passage. The Warder, having distanced his rival,
smiled triumphantly, and appeared quite communicative.
"That," said he—and we all turned our heads eagerly in ttie
direction indicated by his umbrella—" is a door!"
Immensely pleased at the "instruction," we pursued him once
more (now in single file) as he galloped away amongst a perfect forest
of small-arms. He paused in this pleasant game of "Follow my
Leader " to point at a sort of quaint chandelier made of bayonets.
"An exact reproduction of the Prince o' WAXES'S wedding-cake,"
he observed in an awe-stricken under-tone. Reflecting that the
Nuptial Confection of Royalty must have been unusually indiges-
tible, we were off again at the double. Our race grew faster and
faster. Down here, up there, over a bridge, under a window, by a
staircase, through a passage, with a " hi ho, and tantivy!" into the
open air! Surely one of the finest runs of the Season I At the end
of it. our guide told us to go into the Beauchamp Tower, where we
should find another Warder to take his place.
And now we came to the greatest curiosity in the whole collection
—the angriest Beef-Eater in the World! As we entered a small
room, this person from behind his bars (for he fortunately was railed
off from the Public), absolutely trembled with passion. He com-
manded himself, however, sufficiently well to say, "Guide-Books
Sixpence." The suggestion meeting with no response, he cried,
fiercely, "Give me your attention for about two minutes!" Then
he galloped through a "lecture," of which literally I could only
oaten the words, "five sons of the Duke of NORTHUMBERLAND." I
should not have heard even these had he not brought them out
"smartly," in a defiant tone. At last he stopped before a win-
dow. He was a little softened—he had found a joke! He pointed
to an inscription on the wall
of "THOMAS" above a rough
sketch of a bell.
"See," said he, in a milder
tone, but still sternly —
"THOMAS—a bell! THOMAS
ABLE!"
No one laughed. This
seemed to lash him into un-
governable fury.
"I shan't tell yer any
more!" he shouted. "I
haven't time-^-there's a lot
more of yer waiting! I mixes
yer up altogetherF Be off!"
We were so completely taken by surprise by this sudden dismissal
that we immediately tumbled out of the room through a stone stair-
case, into the open air. Here our retreat was covered by a fresh batch
of visitors, who, all unconscious of their impending fate, smilingly
hastened to fill the apartment we had just quitted.
But I was quite unnerved. I have but a faint impression of what
followed. I believe I saw some jewels. I am almost sure I was
invited by a nymph to take some '' grape " wine as I staggered away
completely unmanned. But of this I am certain. Not all the
"information " in the world shall ever make me submit again to a
"Committal to the Tower" on a Free Day!

SOMETHING—STICK IT DOWN ONE I"
OLIVETTE; OR, AN ACdUIRED TASTE.
THE present Strand Management has established a reputation for
a sort of nondescript musical work, of which the chief features are
a few pretty ones on the stage, bright dresses, legs and arms,
and excellent scenery.
Those who saw the late
Madame Favart with-
out Miss ST. JOHN and
Miss CAMBKON, must
have wondered at her
prolonged vitality. But
even with these two
Ladies, and other at-
tractions to boot—in-
cluding high heels—
and with the prestige
of past successes, the
present Company will
have to work their
hardest to make the
Public enthusiastic
about Olivette. The
music, with the excep-
"ONB OP Us." tion of a quintette in
the last Act, is common-
place throughout; the stage business, for the most part, hackneyed
and monotonous; the singing nothing remarkable; the words of
the songs more or less unintelligible; and the story confused.
The leading idea of the plot is the same as that of the farce called
The Ringdoves, where the nephew disguises himself as his uncle in
order to marry the lady to whom the latter is engaged. That is
really all: "the rest is silence"—we would that it were—or rather
the rest is padding, and padding with a considerable amount of stuff.
In one respect it can be favourably compared with Madame Favart,
for the dialogue, at first, is genuinely good—brisk, sharp, and telling.
But the fireworks fizzle away with only occasional gleams through
the Second Act, and scarcely a spark remains to illumine the Third.
M. M \KIUS, who we sincerely hope will find an early opportunity
for giving up OpSra-bonffe and going in for Comedy—though we
admit there are difficulties in his way, as his line on the English


ADMIRAL SWATIN' AND COX-SWAIN.
stage must necessarily be limited—plays a lame part which can
only be made to go at all with a boisterous amount of roaring and
shouting and excessive play of stick. It is neither true burlesque
nor pure comedy, and is but " sound and fury, signifying nothing"
to anybody, though of great importance to the Actor. Mr. ASH-
LET'S shortsighted Duke bears a strong family resemblance to his
part in Madame Favart, only younger; and his sly imitations of
Mr. TOOLK'S peculiar manner and intonation, like Mr. Peter Mag-
mis'» signing himself "Afternoon," are calculated to afford his
friends in front the highest gratification. More of Mr. ASHLKY
himself, and less of Mr. TOOLF.—except where the imitation may be
construed as intentional flattery of that eminent tragedian—would
be, on the whole, judicious—for Mr. ASHLEY.
Mr. Cox, in the small part of Cnquelicot, is quite himself as a
thoroughly "all-round Actor,"—at ail events, in appearance. He
is very funny at first; and this seemed to be fatal to him, for he
shared the fate of the dia-
logue, and fizzled away
to nothing. In fact,
every one begins too
well. It is too bright
to last. The ideas are so
good, their development
so poor. The notion of
the Duke perpetually
conspiring, and always
failing, and the notion of
his choice of conspira-
tors, form a capital
foundation, and yet
nothing worth mention-
ing is built on it.
Perhaps the night we
were there was not what
is termed at the Covent
Garden Concerts a " Hu-
morous Night." Handsome Miss VIOLET CAMEHON went through
her part, as if she had just dropped in by accident to sing a couple
of not very lively 8ongs, and didn't wish it to be supposed for one
moment that she was in any way connected with the plot. The
Comic Tenor, Mr. KNIOHT ASTON, would be an acquisition to the
Mastodon Minstrels, which troupe he could join as the " Elephantine
Comique." Miss ST. JOHN, when she did condescend to play, played
charmingly; but when she didn't, she seemed to be exchanging
confidential nods and smiles with the leader of the orchestra, who
perhaps needs some encouragement to cheer him at his work; though,
by the way, the instrumental!™ and the orchestral performance
must be conceded to the credit side of Olivette1 i account.
We trust that exceptional success will not make Miss FLORENCE
ST. JOHN careless.
Awake, my ST. JOHN! leave all meaner things
To low ambition lounging at " the wings."
The most irritating thing in the whole Opera is the last song " The
Whale and the Torpedo." After twenty minutes or so of dulness,
there was something hopeful in Miss ST. JOHN'S announcement that
she was going to infuse a little life into the Third Act by singing
"The Whale and the Tiirpedo." The title is good and everybody
anticipated a real treat, and as the song was encored, we suppose
that a majority of the audience must have appreciated it. For
ourselves "we could not catch that whale, brave boys,"—in fact,
we could not catch a single word from first to last, and this was
the more annoying, because
everyone on the stage seemed
to be so thoroughly entering
into the joke, whatever the
joke was. There they were
winking at one another, put-
ting their fingers to their
noses, grinning, grimacing,
stamping, dancing, and
laughing, and for the life of
us we could not make out
what it was all about. We
asked our neighbours in the
;hird row, and they couldn't
tell us. It is still a mystery. Perhaps the art was to conceal art,
and induce us to go again; but we shan't,—certainly not while the
stall accommodation is so unaccommodating as it is at present. To
which subject—not to the stalls—we shall return, as we went, anon.

And left defiled the modern music hall.

Be wise, you Senators, be wise in time,
Hide from pur eyes Society's worse crime;
Pour disinfecting fluid down the sink
At which the public laughs, policemen wink.
Let us be human only, and despise
That Market festering beneath our eyes—
The painted cheeks, hoarse voices, faces fagged,
Of those who, saved from dragging, should be dragged
To silent places where neglect atones
For London's insult on her paving stones!

NOTES FROM. THE DIAEY OF A CITY WAITER.
tt us City Waiters
has our long Voca-
tion the same as
other perfessional
people, and BO
direely August
comes, oil' I goes
to Margate, the
Cockney Parydioe
as sumbody called
it, and here I am
for a tew weaks,
hoping to pick up
a job or two now
and then as usual,
and in the society
of many of my
noble Patrons. I
never see Margate
so full of Masters
and Wardens and
Chairmen.
My Life here is
very plessent for
a time. I break-
fasts late and I
dines early and
makes a good Tea,
and then just a
little bit of supper and off to bed. If the weather's fine I takes my
bag of siimps and my City Press, and goes to the Jetty, or the
Sands, according to suckumstances, and whiles away a nidle our.
I never bathe in the Sea, it don't seem quite consistent with my
persition. There's a want of dignity in appearing almost nood in
public, that to me is simply intollerabble!
Perhaps the height of human injyment would be Hanshun Ouse
Feeding with a Margate appetite. Here's a Fillysoffick sayin'—
Them as has plenty to eat has no appytites, and them as has splendid
appytites hasn't enough to eat. It reminds me of the remark as was
made by the Unfortnit Nubbleman now languishing &c. wich he
said about branes.

Feeling yesterday just the least bit in the world tired of setting
all day on the sands, eating srimps and listening to the Niggers, I
went for a change on a little egskursion to Westgate. Just the place
I thought to spend a appy day. Well I have seen and heard of
strange places in my long and waned egsperience, but for reg'lar
quiet and sleepy ness and lazy ness, Westgate beats 'em oiler. Of
course I went and sat on the Beech, and, I hardly expex to be be-
leived when I say, there warn't a single Nigger, nor a Minsterel,
nor no Brass Ban, not even a Organ I No, and hardly a donkey to
be seen, tho Baowif says that when / was there the nobservashun
was soupnfflus. I can't make out what the People does to amuse
theirsels at Westgate. They seemed to be all a reeding or a chat-
ting or a larfing, and some on 'em was a setting and a staring at tie
Sea and the Clouds and the Ships or some such rubbish, and yet
they all seemed quite appy and contented.
Ah, it's the old storey, they 're quite content because they don't
know of nothink better. And yet within 2 or 3 miles of 'em there's
all the joys of Margate reddy to their hands.
How the gratest blessings of life is waisted on some people, and
how thankful ort we to be who are able to apreshiate 'em all.
1 went up to town and to Qildhall on Wensday to see the
Lord Mare elected. I wanted to see what sort of a Rite Honer-
able Gent we was to have next year. I was told he was to be a
Skotchman, and of course that made me rather ankshus. I don't
much care for Skotchmen as a rule, they 're sumtimes dreadful near
in small things, and its principally small things as affects grate
men. I know several of the Beeduls of the Gills, so I 'd no difficulty
in getting in, and wen the Common Sergent told the Common Crier
to order every person as wasn't a Liveryman to leave the All on pain
of imprisonment, I larfed like the rest on 'em. It was the fust
apearanoe of the new Sheriffs' footmen's Liverys, and they certinly
did look gorius. Why they must ha' had Gold Lace enufi upon 'em
to make a Feeld Marshell. Some one said that though the Sheriffs
bort their Servants Liverya, they only highered their lovely Car-
ridges. I don't believe it. The Sheriff as highers his Carridge
lowers his Dignity!
BEOWW said he was told this was to be the last time as a
Alderman was to be Lord Mare; for a Mr. FROTH was a going to
pass a Act of Parlyment to make a Dook the next Lord Mare!
What rubbish I Why the Q.UEEN can make a Dook, and all that;
but she can't make a Lord Mare. There's about a score of Books,
I 'm told, but only one Lord Mare.
How worry pertickler they are to have the Elekshun all straight.
Why they akshally turns out the Lord Mare and all the Aldermen
before the elekshun begins, for fear the Liverymen should be afraid
to do as they likes while they was a looking at 'em. But they kept
the oldest on 'em, Aldmn MAC AKTHTTB, there; and sumboddy with
a very loud voice asked him a lot of questBhuns, some on 'em such
presbua long ones, that I wundred how he could remember 'em.
But BHOWN told me it was all settled beforand; and the Alder-
man knowed what he was going to be asked, and the man with the
loud voice knowed what he was a gouig to answer. Lor, what a lot
of humbug there is in this Mortial World 1 I 'm told if the loud-
voiced Gent doesn't ask any werry orkud imcstshuu. he gits asked
to dinner wunce or twice.
There was lots of Aldermen as wanted to be Lord Mare, and their
names was all put up on a bord, but they don't seem a wery poplar
set, for some on 'em couldn't get a single hand held up for 'em. Why
if I was one on "em and kep a shop or a warehouse, aa they do, I
should send all my shopmen and my clerks to voat for me, it seems
so wery hard not to have a single voat. After the Sheriffs had told
us as Aldmun MACAKTUTTR was dewly elected, the Lord Mare and
the Aldermen, which, poor fellows, had been kep waiting outside, were
allowed to come in again and see what was going on. Then Sir
HENHY BEAK, who I spose is a Majistrate, asked us to do the rite
thing, and so we thanked the Lord Mare, and then we thanked the
Sheriffs, and then we thanked somebody else under the Sheriffs, and
said as how their never had been such a set afore, which would have
all been more satisfactory if I hadn't rekkylektid that we said just
egsackly the same thing last year, and the year before, and the year
before that, and then they all returned thanks, just as if we wos at
dinner, and said as how it was the proudest day of their lives, but
all on 'em looked preshus sorry that their year of glory were over,
and went back to their varrus bi/uissis, without their grand robea
and chains, sadder and plainer, if not wiser men.
Well, Hornimenx is Hornimenx, but give me life without chains,
sez I.

Dusitro all the late discussion concerning the treatment proper for "juvenile
offenders," the delinquents so denominated have been deemed as a matter of
course to mean little boys. It appears to have been taken for granted that,
amongst juvenile offenders, there are practically no little girls. If such is the
fact, it very decidedly shows which sex is really, by nature, by far the better
half of mankind.

THE LAY OF THE LAST LODGER.
i.
H dreary, dreary,
dreary me!
My jaw is sore with
yawning—
I 'm weary of the
dreary sea,
With its roaring
beach
Where sea-gulls
screech,
And shrimpers
shrimp,
And limpets limp,
And winkles wink.
And trousers shrink;
And the groaning,
moaning, dron-
ing tide
Goes splashing and
dashing from side
to side,
With all its might, from morn to night,
And from night to morning's dawning.
u.
The shore's a flood of puddly mud,
And the rocks are limy and slimy—
And I 've tumbled down with a thud—good lud I—
And I fear I swore,
For something tore;
And my shoes are full
Of the stagnant pool;
And hauling, sprawling, crawling crabs
Have got in my socks with starfish and dabs;
And my pockets ore swarming with polypes and
prawns,
And noisome beasts with shells and horns,
That scrunch and scrape, and goggle and gape,
Are up my sleeve, I firmly believe—
And I 'm horribly rimy and grimy.
m.
I 'in sick of the strand, and the sand, and the band,
And the niggers and jiggers and dodgers;
And the cigars of rather doubtful brand;
And my landlady's " rights,"
And the frequent fights
On wretched points
Of ends of joints,
Which disappear, with my brandy and beer,
In a way that, to say the least, is queer.
And to mingle among the throng I long,
And to poke my joke and warble my song—
But there's no one near
On sands or pier,
For everyone's gone and I 'm left alone,
The Last of the Sea-side Lodgers!

A LAST WORD (FOR THE PRESENT) WITH THE
DUKE OP MUDFORD, K.G.
IF I were not only a great Duke, but the bearer of a great historic
name—the descendant of Patriots and Statesmen—of men who held
even their precious lives as nothing when weighed against the public
good; if I had been selected by my Queen for the highest decoration
it is in her power to bestow; if I had boundless wealth, and all the
influence which springs naturally from Money and Title, I would
not live a worse than useless life—a pestilential existence; I would
not stand in the eyes of my fellow-men—I would not go down to
posterity—as the Lord of Muck—the Great Owner of a Leviathan
Nuisance; I would try with all my heart and soul to leave this
miserable world a little better than I found it; I would east off my
hireling agents; I would turn a deaf ear to parochial and official
toadies, who fatten on every public pest and scandal, and leave
others, like myself, to bear the blame; I would not eat^ drink, or
sleep until I had descended into the lowest depths of my filthy pro-
perty; I would listen to the blasphemy of the struggling crowd; I
would smell the stench, I would watch the green and slimy gutters—
the vegetable refuse baking in the sun; I would beard the demon
Typhoid in my den, and in twenty-four hours, at whatever cost, I
would sweep this mabs of corruption from the heart of London.
If I closed my palaces, if I discharged my gamekeepers and sold
my hunters, if I mortgaged my land and pawned my pictures, if I
had to live upon a pauper's diet, I would buy up or strangle
"Vested Interests," I would let in light, and air, and water into
the darkest corners of my property, and what my ancestors left me
as Mud, I would leave to my successors as Marble. I would not use
my " rights " and my position to ride roughshod over the population
of the largest city in the Universe. I would try to be a blessing,
instead of a curse, to London. I would not wait to have things done
in a tempest of popular wrath, which I have the power and feel I
ought to do myself as a matter of simple justice. I would act, in
short, not as a wretched Duke of MUDFORD, but as one who was
worthy to bear the greater name of RUSSELL. Juimrs PUNCH.
THE MEDICAL MONTH.
(An Ode for October.)
'Tis October. Now the Medical young Students all get ready,
For the Session, not so steady as perchance they ought to be;
But with neither Dons nor Proctors, they turn out expert concocters
Of our physic, useful Doctors, though they sometimes loved a
"spree."
They will learn the bones and muscles, and have stout mnemonic
tussles,
As each word another hustles—oh, those anatomic names!
And they '11 study meningitis, measles, fever, and bronchitis,
For your Medico's delight is to know all about our frames.
From their studies when they start 'em, let us hope that nought will
part 'em,
Till they 've learnt lecundum artem to do all that in them lies:
Though ars longa vita brevis, yet to win a short reprieve is
All they aim at, to relieve is what a sage physician tries.
So at King's, or " Barts.," or Charing Cross, or Guy's they '11 enter
sharing
In the lectures, little caring for the wonders that they see;
But when past the preparations for the stiff examinations,
May they win congratulations on attaining the M.D.
WORTHY OF STUDY.

KATTI-PIED.
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
The Crystal Palace.
WHEN an "Intelligent Foreigner" who has never crossed the
Channel, talks sneeringly of London, it is always possible to silence
him with " Ah! but you know not Syd-en-ham!" In Town the
place is regarded with equal veneration. Were it seriously sug-
gested to demolish the Crystal Palace, the papers would be deluged
with letters protesting against the desecration. The "Wonder of
the Nineteenth Century" would be lauded to the skies as the" School
of Nations" and the " Stronghold of the Beautiful and the True."
It cannot be doubted, therefore, that the successor to the greatest
of Great Exhibitions is an object of respectful admiration both at
home and abroad.
Full of this pleasant thought, I ran down to Sydenham, a few days
since, to freshen up my intellectual faculties in the midst of the
treasures of England's grandest creation. On arriving by the
entrance from the High Level Station, the first thing I saw was a
sweet-stuff manufactory (presided over by a genial-looking gentle-
man in a cook's cap) nestling with some stone lions in the bosom of
the Egyptian Court. The first thing I heard (spoken by a check-
taker surrounded by placards) was " Pay here for the animals—only
threepence—the finest Show in the Palace!" Rather shocked by
these symptoms of irreverent familiarity, I walked quickly away,
and immediately tumbled over a miscellaneous collection of busts
mounted on pedestals. These portraits in plaster seemed to be
arranged in no particular order. Statesmen, soldiers, lawyers,
authors, and savants were jumbled together anyhow. For instance,
in one dark corner I found in mournful company, cheek by jowl, Sir
G. COBNEWALL LEWIS, Sir
RODERICK MTTRCHISON,
MARTIN FAHQTTHAB TUP-
PER, RICHARD COBDEN, the
Duke of CAMBRIDGE (at the
age of thirty), and the Hero
of Trafalgar. In another
part of the building colossal
statues of Lord LAWRENCE.
Sir HENRT HAVELOCK, and
a nameless Nobleman who
had insisted on being
"taken" with his coat-of-
arms, were mounting guard
over two cases of stuffed
birdsjand a hair-dresser's shop. Seemingly the Directors had become
possessed, somehow or other, with a job lot of " celebrities," and did
not know what to do with them. Thus it was that great men gazed at
me from all sorts of odd corners. I felt that I could not buy a penny
bun without meeting a stucco likeness of PLATO next the Refresh-
ment-counter, and knew intuitively that if I ascended the Water
Tower, a bust of Mr. MANNS, the Musical Conductor, or a full-length
statue of Mr. TOMPKINS, the famous engineer, would probably be
perched on the summit, waiting to welcome me.
Turning my back upon the "Screen of Kings and Queens,"
which was serving as an entrance to " a table-d'hute dinner" and
a low-priced "tea," I hurried towards the "Courts" that of old


were the attractions of the Palace. I found that some of them
bad been handed over to tradesmen to be converted into shops
ELS "branch establishments to Town houses." The remainder had
been mixed up with cloak-rooms, and were quite empty. I seemed
to be walking through a city of the dead. 1 only met one person
—a boy in the Alhambra, who was stealthily eating a jam-tart,
imagining, apparently, that in the desert he had chosen he was
safe from pursuit.
I now left the Palace for the terrace. Here" I found evidence
that the Directors at one time must have contemplated creating some
Zoological Gardens. A vague placard announced "this way to the
bear pit," and some cages against a dead wall contained a melancholy
eagle, a surly buzzard, and a pair of blaif doves. Bather depressed
by this "very Unhappy Family," I returned to
the main building, to make the acquaintance of
a morose cockatoo, who received my well-in-
tentioned overtures of " Pretty Dick," with un-
mistakable ill-will. Hastily beating a retreat,
and disregarding numerous invitations on pla-
cards to Please take a ticket of my weight,"
I ascended a gallery into "the Technological
Museum." On entering I found some photo-
graphs of battle-scenes, a glass case containing
the nead of " the Scandinavian elk or moose deer,
the model of a lifeboat, an enormous map of the
North Pole, a box full of the component parts of
"sodium or common salt," and lastly, a window
labelled "Illustrations of the Customs and Products of Modern
Egypt." Altogether the specimens seemed to have been arranged
on the same eccentric plan as the collection of plaster celebrities.
The Directors appeared to have said of each exhibit, "Here!
the Refreshment Contractor won't have this in hit department, so
take it off at once to the Technological Museum, and let's have no
more bother about it!"
The remainder of the building consisted of one-tenth Picture-
Gallery to nine-tenths Soho Bazaar. I found that I could buy toys,
soap, ladies' dresses, cartes-de-visite of "professional beauties,"
books, and crockery. I could also make arrangements in the
Tourists' Court" to be "personally conducted by Mr. COOK,
away from the Crystal Pal-
ace at any moment to any
other part of the world.
However, instead of adopt-
ing this inviting but ex-
treme measure, I took a
chair in front of the great
stage to assist at a perform-
ance of the " Variety Enter-
tainment."
As I seated myself, a gen-
tleman in green satin trou-
sers was tossing up some
balls, to the complete satis-
faction of an overflowing
. I immediately recognised him as a most talented person I
had met in a rival educational establishment to the Crystal Palace—
I mean the Royal Westminster Aquarium. Having attained the
object of his highest ambition (balancing a soda-water bottle on a
breakfast plate) with a slight crash of crockery, he gave place to
"Professor de LTJIE, Prestidigitateur." The new arrival, who
appeared in evening dress, good-humouredly put on a pigtail as a
preliminary to producing some bird-cages and paper lanterns from
an empty hat. Having received gracefully the lavish congratula-
tions of the Public, he also retired, in
favour of two Acrobats. These gentle-
men were supplied with a chair (upon
which were placed placards of weights)
and half-a-dozen cannon-balls. Then,
to the sounds of sweet and solemn
music (kindly furnished by the "Com-
pany's Military Band"), the athletes
raised the heavy projectiles to their
shoulders and balanced them on their
biceps. The applause was deafening.
I now thought it time to retire. I had seen enough of "the veritable
glory of Old England" and its attractions. I had sufficiently care-
fully examined " theSohool'of Nations" and "the Stronghold of the
Beautiful and the True."
Before leaving, however, I looked at the Entertainment once again,
as a burst of tumultuous applause reached my ears. A gentleman
in a grotesque costume, with the aid of talented assistants, was
standing on the top of a ladder—on his head! This was the last straw!
My reverence for the spot, which had been on the wane all day,
vanished suddenly altogether, and I came to the abrupt conclusion
that the Crystal Palace emphatically is not the sort of place it 18
popularly supposed to be I

THE attention of Parliament
Oat of Session at present, and
prospectively In, is due to an
admirable regulation on the part
of the managers of the Church
Conference which lately met at
Leicester under the Presidency of
the Lord Bishop of PETER-
BOHOUGH. That Right Reverend
Prelate, at the outset of pro-
ceedings, announced " that 'ap-
pointed' speakers should be
allowed fifteen minutes to address
the Meeting, and 'unappointed'
speakers ten minutes, and that
the bell would be sounded two
minutes before the limit was
reached, in order to enable the
respective speakers to find perora-
tions." A considerate arrange-
ment this last, to exempt a
speaker from the necessity of
coming to a lame and impotent
conclusion, or of having to be
pulled down by his coat-tails.

THE REAL ROUGH'S GUIDE.
THAT we have of Guide-Books enough and to spare, may certainly
be alleged with a great deal of truth. There is the aristocratic
Guide-Book, from which you learn in half-an-hour more of History,
Archaeology, Architecture, and Art than you ever knew before in
your life, but which leaves you in profound ignorance as to hotels,
trains, or steamboats. There is the severely practical Guide, which
orders you hither and thither, bids you pause at this place or that
place to admire the view, but at no other, gives you such minute
instructions as to your trains that your journey is one long night-
mare of Bradihaw, but will on no account condescend to bestow on
you the smallest scrap of history or romance. And there is the
economical Guide, which will take you to Brussels and back for
£4 10»., and which dictates the centimes you are to bestow upon the
waiters at the Gate des Milles Colonnes or upon the flower-girls of
the Marohe de la Madelaine. But all these are intended for the use
of the presumably respectable classes. No Guide-Book has yet been
written for the benefit of those who are not presumably respectable.
We have therefore thought it worth our while, considering the
interest bestowed upon the criminal classes just now, to collect a few
cuttings from the daily papers in hopes that the criminal classes may
benefit thereby, and that the work may be, as it professes to be, a
Real Rough's Guide.
Bury.—To this town we can heartily award praise, and can assure
our readers that they will find it well worth a visit. For poaching,
assaulting a gamekeeper and a policeman, a collier has been recently
sentenced to three months' hard labour. When we consider that,
for stealing twopennyworth of corn, a boy at Wolverhampton
received a similar sentence, our readers will, we feel sure, not accuse
us of having extolled Bury too highly. The gaol is spoken of warmly
by those who have stopped there.
Leeds.—Upon this important manufacturing town we can bestow
an unqualified eulogium. For embezzling twopence a tramway car
conductor has been sentenced to a month's imprisonment and one
blot on the scutcheon. On the other hand, for knocking down, and
kicking while down, a police surgeon and his wife, the former of
whom was visiting a patient, two men received a similar sentence as
the tramway car conductor, but with the option of a fine. The beau
ideal, the paradise of the rough is that spot where human limbs and
life are appraised at the lowest commercial value. Now, at Leeds,
twopence = one month; knocking down and kicking two people =
one month. Ergo, ditto, ditto, one person = a fortnight or one
penny. A town where you can half murder a woman for a penny
speaks for itself. Long live Leeds 1
Liverpool.—We do not advise the traveller, unless he has much
spare time, to remain any lengthy period in this dull city. For
beating a child with the buckle of a strap a man has been sentenced
to three months' hard labour. Monstrous! A child travels all over
the world at half-price, and taking the Leeds standard, as every
rough must do, as the correct one, the punishment in this case,—even
supposing that following the injunction of the wise SOLOMON merits
punishment—should have been one halfpenny.
Manchester.—A town to be avoided. For half-starving a child a
woman has been sentenced to six months' hard labour. Half-starv-
ing is not worse than knocking down and kicking, and considering
we had to speak disparagingly of Liverpool, words fail us to do full
justice to Manchester.
North Shields.—Fairly good. Here a man for refusing to go to
sea after signing articles, was fined five pounds. Bad in itself, our
readers may say, but not by comparison to Liverpool. There a man
for going on board a ship without leave, was sentenced to a month's
hard labour. North Shields may be visited in tolerable safety.
Sittingbourne.—By contrast a pleasant enough town. A man was
sentenced to three months' hard labour for stealing a funeral pall.
The pall, however, was worth seven pounds. The best gaol to stop
at is in Maidstone.
Warrington.—To be avoided as the plague. A low hole devoid of
interest! When we simply say that for breaking his own wife's
nose, and .beating her with a rolling-pin till she was insensible, a
man was actually sentenced to six months' hard labour, all we can
do is to raise our hands and ask, "Are we in a free country, or
are we slaves?"
Wolverhampton.—A boy here was sentenced to three months for
stealing twopennyworth of corn. This by the Leeds standard would
be three months for assaulting two people. We are sorry we cannot
recommend Wolverhampton so warmly as we should like.
To sum up, we recommend the following order of merit:—
1. Leeds; 2. Bury; 3. Sittingbourne; 4. North Shields; 5. Wol-
verhampton; 6. Manchester; 7. Liverpool; 8. Warrington.
At a future date we may possibly give a few more hints likely to
be of value to the travelling Rough.

Bishop,
CHAPTER XVIII.
UPSETTING THE CAET.
~B Arehbeaeon and Mr.
OVERWAYTE found Mrs.
DOWDIE in thedrawing-
room of the Palace.
I honestly confess I
do not like Mrs. DOW-
DIE, hut in her present
distress I must say I
pity her. To be turned
out of her husband's
room, to be deposed from
auth irityinthepresenee
of the man whom she
had introduced to the
whom she herself had
patronised, and who had professed
himself at one time her devoted
slave,—it was too much. It was
too bad. The Bishop should pay
for it when he came to his senses.
But how? And poor Mrs. DOW-
DIE fumed and fretted, but could
not get at the solution of the
difficulty. In this manner nearly
a day passed without her seeing
the Bishop.
"Let him come and humble
himself to me,".she said to herself.
"I don't catch myself going to him."
And so she sat in solitary grandeur, and took her meals alone; hut
the Bishop did not appear.
Mrs. OVEBWATTE was triumphant. "My dear Mrs. DOWDIE,
you 've heard the news, of course?" she began.
The Bishop's wife regarded her curiously.
"What news?"
"What news! Why, all Small-Beerjester's ringing with it.
The walls are placarded. The pictures are out."
"Pictures! gasped Mrs. DOWDIR. And then what she had seen
through the keyhole of the Crumpet and Crazier suddenly flashed
across her.
"Pictures "commenced the Arehbeaeon.
"Hold your tongue!" said his wife. Then turning to Mrs.
DOWDIE, she went on—" Pictures of Canon MATTIX and La Mar-
chesa. She has eloped with him!"
Mrs. DOWDIE smiled bitterly. The Canon had gone off, and the
report had been heard all over Small-Beerjester. So much the better.
It was an enemy out of her path.
"I '11 go and tell the Bishop," said the Arehbeaeon.
Then the two Ladies counselled together, and for the first time
came to something like an agreement. I am not saying that, as
MORLEENA'S sister, Mrs. OVERWATTE was wrong in proposing Mr.
ARABLE for the vacant posts of Dean and Canon and Bishop's chap-
lain. It is probably what any one of you would have done. Mrs.
DOWDIE was meditating whether Mrs. OVEHWATTE'S alliance was of
sufficient value, when the Archbeacon returned, pale and flurried.
'Have you seen a ghost?" inquired his wife.
"I wish I could see even the ghost of a chance of finding the
Bishop," he replied.
"What!!" screamed poor Mrs. DOWDIE.
"He's not to be found—not to be seen anywhere," said Dr. OVER-
WATTE, mopping his forehead.
In less time than it takes to tell, Mrs. DOWDIE had rushed down
to the study. It was in utter disorder. The desk was open; the
Surse, cash-box, and cheque-book all vanished. They ran to the
ressing-room. Not a vestige of the Bishop, except a tattered apron,
a third-rate old shovel-hat, some worn-out gaiters, and lawn-sleeves
much the worse for wear.
"His bag! his portmanteau!" cried his wife.
All gone! He had taken all his boots, leaving only a rack behind!
At last, over the chimney-piece, on the diocesan notice-board,
which served as a professional memorandum of dates for visitations,
sermons, ordinations, and so forth, a note caught Mrs. DOWDIE'S eye.
She tore it open, and read—" Off on tour with ZAZZEGLIA and Canon.
Not back for three months. After that time, diocese business as
before, and Orders punctually attended to."
Mrs. DOWDIE uttered one cry, and fainted in the Archbeaoon's
arms. When she recovered consciousness, the Sheriff's officers were
in the place, and a shabby individual introduced himself to her as
the man in possession. Realism? the situation, and making as much
as she could out of it, with some assistance from a distant relative
who luckily wasn't at all near, she went to the Station, determined to
follow in her husband's track. From information she received at
the Detective Office, Mrs. DOWDIE went off in a wrong direction;
and here, with deepest sympathy, and regretting that an Author's
duties will not allow him to accompany a lady alone on a voyage of
discovery, I must leave her, and return to Small-Beerjester.
The Archbeaoon at once telegraphed up to the Prime Minister—
"See vacant. Sale to-morrow. Sic transit."
The telegraph Superintendent, however, being a sharp fellow, cor-
rected the spelling, and put his own interpretation on the despatch,
so that the message read thus:—
"Open sea. Sail to-morrow. Sough postage."
And the Prime Minister, unable to understand it, sent it to the First
Lord of the Admiralty, who, on going out of office, left it to the next
person who came in. Owing to this clerical error, MORLEENA, who
was determined that her sister should not have it all her own way,
went up to Downey Street, attended a Cabinet Council, and the
result was that the Clerk of the Course issued the following in-
structions :—
ARABLE 1
SIMPLER 2
ARCHBEACON 3
THE FIELD 0
This decision was, on the whole, favourably received in Small-
Beerjester, and Mr. ARABLE was made Bishop, with a Canonry,
Deanery, Percentorship, Beadledom, and Mastership of Deedler's in
his gift, of which preferments the two first he divided between his
father-in-law (Mr. SIMONY SIMPLER) and Dr. OVEHWATTE, keeping
the others himself; but on the recommendation of the Penny Pro-
metheus, with whose Editor he particularly wished to keep on good
terms, he conferred the Beadleship, reduced to less than fifty pounds
per annum, on JOHN BOUNCE, who, after holding the office for some
years, I may here say, was so ill treated, on account of his oocked-
aat and old-fashioned dress, by the small boys of Small-Beerjester
on Guy Fawkes' Day, that he took to the only spare bed in Deedler'a
Hospital, and ended his days under the roof—m a top attic—of the
very place he had so energetically attempted to destroy.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
Madame Tustaufs.
AMONGST the many educational establishments of the Modern
Babylon, the far-famed " Show " in Baker Street holds a proud and
S-eminent, position. What the Polytechnic used to be to Science,
adame TUSSAUD'S Exhibition is to History—Ancient and Modern.
The Heroes of the Past and the Present are therein represented in a
state of wax " materialisation." Those who visit the Gallery are
enabled to understand the hidden meaning of many State secrets—
the unsuspected peculiarities of not a few noted individuals.
Full of this solemn consideration, I passed the turnstile, and was
greeted with a stern cry of "Leave your umbrella!" I looked up,
and found that I was apparently being ad-
dressed by the late CHABLES DICKENS, who had
given up literature to attend to the "sticks
and umbrellas." The great Novelist held out
his hand for a fee. Respect would have made
me comply with this request, had not a Com-
miisionnaire repeated the order even in more
peremptory terms, looking the while over his
shoulder at a policeman standing in the door-
way. Then I rebelled, and walked angrily away
with my property regardless of the consequences,
which were not serious, as the constable was only
a tailor's dummy. The Representative of the
Civil Power turned out to be a suit of clothes
surmounted with the head of a half-forgotten Somebody—I think
Lord LYTTON, for I found him, with General HAVELOCK, Sir CHARLES
JAMES NAPIER and Lord CLYDE, erased from the Official Catalogue.
And such is Fame!
I now commenced my researches, as a Student of History, in
earnest. I had not far to go before I came upon an " incident" full
of interest to those who love Italy. GARIBALDI was complaining to
VICTOR EMMANUEL that HUMBERT had stolen his pocket-handker-
chief. The charge was an unfounded one, as the useful article was
reposing in a glass-case under the hero's very feet. For all this, so
accustomed was the present King of ITALY to these accusations of
petty larceny, that he was not taking the trouble to defend himself.
VICTOR EMMANUEL, convinced of Ms son's guilt, seemed to be
vigorously upbraiding him in a forcible speech, which apparently
ended with the words, " And if you must take something from your
Country's Friend, why didn't you choose his cloak?" Passing by
Lord HABTINGTON (who apparently uses hair-dye) I came to an
illustration of the Great African Puzzle. CETEWAYO (attended by a
couple of wives, who were not laughing, because they had heard all
his jokes a thousand times before) was smilingly asking Sir GARNET
WOLSELEY a riddle which the modern WELLINGTON was on the eye
of giving up. In the background Lord CHELMSFOBD, in a rich uni-
form, was seen muttering how utterly impossible he had found it
to have anything to do with a fellow who would put on a blanket
when he was asked out to dinner!" In the next group costume was
again the subject of angry controversy. Lord BROUGHAM and
0 CONNELL were quarrelling over the respective merits of their long
velvet-collared cloaks. They had called m, as arbitrators, Mr. JOHN
BRIGHT and Mr. COBDF.N. The former, much annoyed at being
mixed up in such an unpleasant affair, was explaining that really,
"as a member of the Society of Friends, he knew absolutely nothing
about dress," while the latter was attempting to create a diversion
by saying, "Fancy talking about your cloaks! Why, they are not
a patch upon the one worn by Lord BYRON in another part of the
building! And though you may be proud of
your shirt-frills, you should just see At*
diamond pin!"
I was now met with a murmur of "It isn't a
bit like him!" and " I shouldn't have known
him again if you hadn't told me who it was!"
and found that I was standing in front of a
portrait-model of WILLIAM SHAKSPEARE. The
poet was a prolific writer, but probably would
have given many more works to Posterity had
he not seemingly, from this presentment of him
"in the habit as he lived," spent three-quarters
of his waking hours in the arrangement of his
hair! Turning my back upon "the Indian
Group," which was only remarkable for the
longing gaze bestowed upon it by Mr. BRADLAUGH, who seemed
to be tempering his regret with the consideration that, "after
all, if he joined it he couldn't be of much use, as he had given
up swearing," I sat down in front of an incident in Palace life,
wnich roused my loyalty to fever heat. It was the Court of Her
Majesty during an evening party. The Bishop of LONDON was
explaining the figures of a little dance, of his own invention, to
the Duke of EDINBURGH, the Princess of WALES, the Duke of CON-
NAUGHT, and his charming bride. The latter seemed quite ready to

)egin, although the former appeared to be rather uncertain whether
;hey quite understood all the steps. The Prince of WALES, standing
sy the side of his August Mother, was saying, " Pray excuse me. I
really can't join you in this enormous cloak; and I don't like to take
it off, as I am suffering from influenza!" Mr. GLADSTONE, on the
other hand, was vainly trying to persuade Lord STANLEY, in a
corner, to make a side couple, as "dancing was excellent exercise
when you couldn't get any wood-cutting." The one discordant
note came from the Earl of SHAFTESBUBY, who was talking to Lord
LORNB "like a father." "No, my son," the noble Earl was evi-
lently saying, "you shall not partake in this frivolous amusement.
[ have a great respect for the Church, but, for all that, I cannot
help emphasising my extreme displeasure at the whole affair by
turning my back in the most marked manner upon the Bishop of
LONDON! As we say in another place, the Right Reverend Prelate
is old enough to know better! "The incident" seemed likely
to be closed by the "saraband" being given up in favour of a
hornpipe "kindly favoured" by the late Viscount NELSON. In
fact, the Hero of Trafalgar had evidently " shivered his timbers"
as a preliminary to a vigorous double shuffle. The scene was as
charming as it was unconventional!
Leaving this pretty picture of Palace life, I approached ABEAHAM
LINCOLN and General GRANT severely upbraiding " President JOHN-
SON" for having come to dinner in "correct evening costume" (with
the sole exception of the shirt), when they had told him not to
dress." Pleased with this Republican characteristic, I walked away
to the other side of the room, and "assisted " at a practical joke illus-
trative of the "habits and customs of the Court of Russia." Briefly
General MELIKOFF was bitterly complaining that the Grand Duke
NICHOLAS had taken away his helmet, leaving in its stead a plain
white cap in marked contrast with his otherwise handsome uniform.
The CzABKWiTCH was immensely amused at the pleasantry, and was
backing up his relative not to return the General's helmet, but to
keep it on his own head where it now was placed. The late Emperor
NICHOLAS, seeing that the warrior was really angry, seemed to be
pouring oil on the waters by offering his hat as "he had no further
use for it." The CZAR was keeping out of the quarrel by saying that
he had " lost his helmet too," while the Grand Duke MICHAEL, with
an enormous whip, was evidently of opinion that the best way to settle
the dispute would be "to give them a good knouting all round!" This
savage scene, so different from the picture of our own peaceful Court,
made me feel that I had acted wisely in being born a Briton.
If I were not confined by space, I could point to a score of other
highly interesting historical episodes. I could tell how MABTIN
LUTHER and JOHN KNOX quarrelled with one another—the first de-
fending himself with an enormous pen, the last with a huge book—
while poor CALVIN bitterly lamented that he could not with justice
to himself enter into the argument, because he had failed to bring
with him a " really serviceable carving-knife." I could hint that
Louis PHILIPPE'S intense melancholy was caused by the reflection
that he was next destined for the melting-pot. I could suggest
that Sir WALTER SCOTT'S unreasonable joy was attributable to the
consideration that his
Highland costume included
"fleshings." I could ex-
press astonishment that
HANNAH DOBBS had been
put in " the Golden Cham-
ber " as an addition to the
"Napoleon Group." But
I refrain, and satisfy my-
self by asserting that " the
Congress" must really be
seen to be appreciated.
Apparently the Ambassa-
dors did not meet at that
Historical Gathering to
consider the Treaty of
Berlin, but to have supper. Then it was that BISMARCK, with his
usual love for rough waggery, tried to persuade the Turk that two
cocked hats and some paper were the usual ingredients of a
European Banquet. The rest of the company, it is now certain,
backed him up in this mauvaue plaisanterie, Lord BEACONSFIELD
laughing heartily the while to encourage the belief amongst his
colleagues that he was intimately acquainted with the subtleties of the
French language. But want of space prevents me, and 1 am silent.
Madame TUSSAUD'S Exhibition is extremely amusing. It has,
however, a blot, and a bad one, the Chamber of Horrors. I hoped to
be able to say a good word for it, but after the most superficial glance
at its unsavoury contents, I was forced to give up what would have
been a pleasant task in despair. The proprietors, for their own sakes
should close it at once. It is not only nasty, but demoralising.

SCHOOL-BOARDS OR FOOL BOARDS?
THE men who undertake to teach or regulate the teaching of the
multitude, should not require teaching. It should not be possible
for an impartial looker-on, like Punch, to write them down asses,
and something worse. Who is the Rev. H. M. SORLEY? An influ-
ential member of the Tottenham School-Hoard, regulating the educa-
tional affairs of Would-be-Green. Would-be-Green is blessed or
cursed, according to the view you take, with a rival educational
establishment, or sink of iniquity, called the Alexandra Palace.
This palace, unlike most palaces, pays enormous rates and taxes,
instead of consuming national money, and employs a number of
children. How does it employ them? The Rev. H. M. SOELEY (it
ought to be printed "SURLY") thinks very badly. He understood
"that one young child came on at the Palace as Mr. Gladstone,
another as Lord Beaconsfield, and a third as Napoleon Bonaparte.
They ought to be learning to spell instead of being allowed to repre-
sent such exalted individuals, the doing of which would have the
effect of puffing them up with such notions of their own superiority
that they would come to the conclusion that they could do without
education altogether."
Surely the spirit of the late lamented Bumble inspired this
speech. Is there no "puffing up" in the School-Board scheme of
education'? Has the Rev. Mr. Won LEY, who carried his point with
the aid of another Reverend, instructed the Would-be-Green school-
master to avoid all historical and political teaching, all allusions to
JULIUS C.&SAB and OLIVER CROMWELL, for fear of "puffing up" his
pupils? Has he been told to go back to the rustic simplicity of the
three R's," and to avoid everything which the School-Board was
established to teach?
There are Sohool-Boards and School Bores, the latter having been
dragged from Vestry-Halls and obscure pulpits to administer a
system they neither understand nor appreciate. Having brought
Local Self-Government into contempt, and made the Gospel unpopu-
lar, they are now doing their best to strangle compulsory education.
They know nothing of life, of human nature, of the struggle for
bare existence in the homes of the multitude. They count the
crammed heads, and care nothing for the empty stomachs under-
neath them. The famished child may come and go as long as he can
aspirate his h's. They are great at prosecutions, and unflinching in
the application of their bye-laws. They have no elasticity—no give
and take in their disposition; and if they fail in exacting fines from
the poorest of the poor, it is due to the superior humanity of the
Stipendiary Magistrates.^ If Compulsory Education is to live and
move and do its work, it must first be applied to the minds and
hearts of its Directors.
THE MEMORIAL OBSTRUCTION.
(Discussed Thursday, October 7, t» Court of Common Council.)
SAYS Mr. BEDFORD, " Cost? Oh, I expect
Five thousand, say, or six, to be correct—
At least so states the City Architect."
They call the City Architect, and then
Says he, "This work of Art, 0 Council Men,
Cannot be done at all for less than ten."
Some loudly cry, "Rescind the Resolution!"
More shout, "No! that's against our Constitution!
We sinned at first, we know; to that we 're pinned,
Never shall it be said that we re-sinned."

AN esteemed Foreign Correspondent sends us the following extract from the Jornal do

lumiram-Be : 720 duzias de frascos de aguardente, 470 duzias de garrafaa de vinho, 1: 600 duzias de garafae

"The Bankers' Festival" evidently means a Bank Holiday. This Festival the readers of
the paper are informed was celebrated at the Alexandra Palace, where it is supposed the
GLTNS, LrHIIOCKS, ROTHSCHILDS, and others met and imbibed seven hundred and twenty
dozen of brandy, &o., &o., and twenty-two tons of eatables. Then the writer naturally com-
pliments the English Bankers' capacity for victuals and drink. Why, if their readers swallow
this—Bankers and all—they '11 swallow anything.

Town Clerk. He must be ready to dine at

IMPERIAL, ROYAL AND ACADEMICAL.

"KATHLEEX MA-YAUOHAN-
EEN."
Policy (Mr. HOLIINO-
SHEAD'S) has dictated the production
of Mr. REECE'S Half -Crown Dia-
monds for the Imperial's Mutinies.
The Diamonds are brilliantly Reece-
set, and the piece Reece-snscitated.
Scissors have been used, but no paste
is apparent, and the puns, some of
them brought from ever so far, are
veritable sparklers.
Miss FARHEN, Miss VAUGHAN, and
Mr. ROYCE, in their different lines —
and every line is given admirably,
and not a point lost — are the life and
soul of the fun. The best thing is
the trio to the tune of "Nancy Lovea
a Sailor," in which Miss FARREN'S
rendering of her verse is quite enough
of itself to get the encore. There is
also an imitation of the steps and
tableaux of the Mastodon Minstrels,
which will probably figure in every Christmas Pantomime. Miss
VACGHAN'S graceful dancing has sel-
dom been seen to greater advantage—
we beg Mr. REECE'S pardon, we should
say ad-Vaughan-tage— than in the Jfa/f-
Croton Diamonds. Mr. ROTCK is lovely
as usual. The stalls at the Imperial are
comfortable, and when a visitor can sit
comfortably, he is more easily — beg par-
don, we should have said more Reece-ily
— pleased. The Royalty stalls are also
comfortable; hut on this subject gene-
rally we will not forestall— not even by
one stall — the report of our Inspector
who is going the rounds in disguise.
Mr. BYRON'S Bow Sells is a varia-
tion on the same " Retired Tradesman"
theme, which he has been so fond of
harping — or 'arping — upon since the
success of Our Boys. In Courtship
Mr. ANSON was a Retired Tradesman,
with the Butterman's difficulties as to
his aspirates; and so is Mr. TOOLE in the Upper Crust. Whal
suits Mr. DAVID JAMES and Mr. TOOLS does not seem to fit

"COUNT DB CAMPO"WITU
A "FAKRBN" ACCENT.
Mr. RIGHTON in Sow Sells: or perhaps the character, funny and
well drawn as it is, is beginning to pall upon play-goers. The Third
Act is the best; but here, unfor-
;unately, the interest seems to com-
mence, instead of culminate. There
are " Our Boys'" Dick Sycamore, well
alayed by Mr. FRANK COOPER, and
Fred Latham (Mr. H. KELSEY), and
'Our Girls'" Effie (MissLAWLEH), and
Bessie (Miss BMMA RITTER) • but
they are feeble folk; at the best—
mere shadows of their former selves.
Mr. BYRON, with bushels of ideas to
spare, seems to have just sketched out
this one, and then chucked it away.
Mr. WYATT is artistically made
up, as Sloggs, the surly Gardener,
with a high light on his nose, that
wants toning down.
The Adventuress, Mrs. Percival
(Miss MAGGIE BRENNAN), and her
brother, the bogus Captain, (Mr.
PHILLIP DAY)—who assumes a manner and tone rather suggestive of
how Mr. BANCROFT might play a Swell after some severe attack of
rheumatism which had affected his legs and voice—bear a striking
resemblance to the Adventuress and her military brother in Home,
the English version of L'Aventuriere.
By the way, the swindling, Captain Basil Bagot's real name turns
out to he that of our good old villanous friend of ancient Melo-
drama—the familiar " Brandon "—some relation, no doubt, to Black
Brandon in Poll and Partner Jo. How many bad people in melo-
dramas and novels have been christened Brandon.' Why? What
is there so specially criminal about BRANDON? Yet so it is; and the
name of BRANDON, until some daring Dramatist Jpluckily converts

'THE KolCE-TBKBH."

THE RIQUT'VX IN THE WRONG PLACB.
him from the error of his ways, and places him in respectable
society as a virtuous hero, will oe associated with all that IB worst
in human nature on the Stage to the last hour of its existence.
What Popsy Wopsy (libretto by Mr. GRUNDY, and music by Mr.
SOLOMON) is like we must discover another time, as on this occasion
a distinguished foreigner insisted on our taking him to the Oxford,
which our friend imagined was somehow or other affiliated to the
University as an Academy of Music. Undergraduates, however, are
not in the habit of behaving themselves as decorously at entertain-
ments in their University town, as do the audience at this Music Hall.
They are not taking their pleasure sadly, but soberly, and seriously.
A mixed but generally respectable audience sits, smokes, and re-
freshes itself contentedly, thoroughly appreciating Mr. ARTHUR
ROBERTS, who, in his peculiar line, is a real artist. He sang five
capital songs, assuming and sustaining a different type of character
—caricature of course— on each occasion. He was steadily applauded,
but ROBERTS and REEVES don't approve of encores.
Then came on an imitator of birds—the best we 've heard since the
days of the famous HERR VON JOEL, in the salad days, that is the
GREEN days, when EVANS'S was EVANS'S—as, perhaps, it may-
be again on certain very necessary conditions, of which we shall
probably hear something at licensing time next week. In the
public interest—not in the interest of a public—we are decidedly
in favour of giving every support to properly superintended and re-
spectably conducted Music Halls—and we cannot arrive at any satis-
factory solution of the problem why a licence for dancing should be
refused to the superior class of Music Halls, and granted to the in-
ferior. The Collective Magisterial wisdom is possibly specially
inspired to draw some fine distinction between Tweedledum and
Tweedledee^or rather between Bumbledom and Bumbledee, and the
more there is in future of Bumble dumb the better for the Metropolis
and its amusements.

Death is now the Tambour Major, and he rolls his rataplan.

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
; youngest boy
was aUus my
faverit, so
when he was
about 10,' I
wanted what
I calls a good
school for him,
that is, where
every think's
found and no-
think to] pay.
So I kep my
ears opun, and
soon heard
what City GUIs
had got schools,
so I was xtrar
civil to some
Masters of
Kumpennies,
an knowin
their week
mominz, soon
got my boy
into a school
where he
didn't kprst me
a shillin for
sivin yew.
An yet some narrer minded peeple abuse the Gills! and say their
money belongs! to the Lower Orders. What rubbish! I dispise the
Lower Orders. What good are they to us Waiters? BBOWN says,
and I agrees with him, that if you gives one on 'em a crust of bread,
he wants somebody to butter it for him, and someboddy else to lend
him a knife to cut it with. They 've no self-dependence and no
reverens and no respec.
I sumtimes wunders what all this here talk about Eddicashun
means. What's it a goin to do for us? Shall we all be happier
and better, or miserabler and wusser? Will Gents be more libberal
to us poor Waiters, or wisey wusseyf Will Waiters be more
respeciul and kontented, or prowder and ortier? That's the
questshun, as the man says in the Play. Most of my noble Patrons in
the City haint had much on it, so I 'm told, but they seems to get on
werry well without it. BBOWN and me quite shudders when we sees
one of the Lunnattix as has gone mad on the subjek, such as a School
Boarder, or a Littery man or summut of that sort, get up to say
somt t hink after dinner. Lor, what a diffruns that makes. Instid
of a short sharp jolly sort of speech, that all can injoy, Waiters and
all, and as sets us all a grinnin, we has to lissen to a parsel of
stuff that verry few on us undustand, and noboddy cares a bit about,
as you can see by the looks on 'em.
A eddicated man allers makes a long speech.
One as ain't, allers makes a short one.
One to us as ain't!
A eddicated man is allers dissatisfied with everythink, Institoo-
tions, Kustums, Dinners, Gills, Waiters, everythink.
One as isn't, isn't.
One more to us as isn't!
The natteral hinfrince seems to be, that Eddicashun means
Change for eyerythink, and, As you are, means Contenmunt with
thinx as they is.
Then I for one proposes a Toast—"Thinx as they ar, root and
branch, and may they flurrish for ever I>:
I don't know much about Bates and Taxs myself as 1 never pays
none, but I 'm told by them as does, that there's no Rate as they
pays in the City with grater grumblin and growlin than the
School Rate, and quite rite too. Why can't people be let to do as
they likes, and why should a man be made to pay for what will some
day make his man-servant and his made-servant and even his own
children larf at him for his ignurinse of what they nose?
Proper Eddicashun don't mean Schoolin, but should teach us all,
whether Waiters or otherwise, to learn and labour truly to get a
good Livin, as the poor Curit said to his Biehup.
I sumtimes takes my walks abroad in Common Garden Market,
—which were it as it ort to be, wot a parrydies it mite he. but as it
is its a horful disgrace to the Muddroppiliss—and when I stands a
gazin at the butiful Grapes at 25s. a pound and the very early
Strorbrees at 2s. (Jd. a nounoe and the lovely Old English Pie
Nappels at two Ginnizs a peice, I smaks my lips an I says to

PURITY OP ELECTION.
THE Briborough Election Commission commenced yesterday before
Mr. BUMPTIOUS, Q.C., Mr. BALLOT (C.), and Mr. Box (L.)
The case having been shortly opened, Mr. BALLOT said the first
witness he would call would be Mr. TOADY.
Mr. Box said his friend might call Mr. TOADY till he was black in
the face.
Mr. BALLOT said he was perfectly aware of that fact, and should
avail himself of his rights if he thought fit. He would call
Mr. TOADY.
Mr. BUMPTIOUS, (i.C., said that if the witness didn't turn up
soon, he would make it lively for him. Where was the man
TOADY?
Mr. Box understood that he had left the town on hearing of these
proceedings.
Mr. BALLOT would like to know who instigated him to that das-
tardly course of action.
Mr. Box wanted to know what his friend meant by that?
Mr. BALLOT said if the cap fitted his friend, he might wear it.
Mr. Box intimated that there were certain persons who would be
worse fitted by a cap than a strait-waistcoat.
Mr. BALLOT appealed to the Chief Commissioner for protection.
Mr. BUMPTIOUS, (i.C., threatened to commit everybody unless
something was done. He wasn't going to sit there all day. He
wanted his lunch.
Mr. SLIME was then called :—
Mr. BALLOT asked him if he had received £200 from the Liberal
Member?
Witness. Yes.
Mr. Ballot. Yes? Oh, you have, have you? Now then, be very
careful. What did you do with that t

Mr. Bumptious, Q. C. Then keep your low stable jargon for some-
where else. What did you do with that money F
Witness. I bought beer. Sir.
Mr. Bumptious, Q. C. Beer! And are you not ashamed of your-
self to stand up there in that box, and say you 've drunk two hun-
dred pounds' worth of beer?
Mr. Ballot. He means that he bought beer to bribe Liberal voters
with.
Mr. Box. I protest against my learned friend's putting words into
this witness's mouth.
Mr. Bumptious, Q. C. I don't want your protestations; and I can
assure you, Mr. BALLOT, I can understand the meaning of the Eng-
lish language as well as you can. This man has spent two hundred
pounds in beer. He is evidently a notorious drunkard. He is not
sober now.
Witness. If you please, Sir, I am a teetotaller.
Mr. Bumptious, Q.C. Of course you are—of course. I don't
think, Sir, you are to be believed on your oath. Leave the Court,
and don't let me catch you here again.
Witness. It is very hard
Mr. Bumptious, Q. C. It will be very hard labour, if you don't go.
Mr. Box. With your permission I will ask this witness a few
questions.
Mr. Bumptious, Q.C. Oh, all right—don't mind me. _ I am no-
body here. Ask him a thousand, and I wish you joy of his answers.
Mr. Box. The two hundred you received from the Liberal Member
was a loan P

Sir. Bumptious, Q. C. Do you think I am deaf, Mr.
BALLOT?
Mr, Box. It was not a loan! Now, be very careful!
—was it, or was it not, a loan?
Witness. No, it wasn't alone, because there were some
other sums with it.
M: Ballot. Even at the risk of offending the Chief
Commissioner, I must congratulate my friend on the
admirable manner in which he has conducted this
examination.
Mr. Bumptious, Q.C. But you have offended the
Chief Commissioner.
_Mr. Box. And I don't want your congratulations.
Keep them for yourself; they must be rather scarce with
you.
Mr. Ballot. I would ask the Chief Commissioner
whether that was the language for one gentleman to use
to another?
Mr. Bumptious, Q.C. When I hear one gentleman
use that language to another gentleman, I will let the
persons engaged in this case know. Are you going on?
Mr. Box. Now then, Mr. SLIME, what did you receive
from the Conservative Member?
Witness. A little over five hundred pounds.
Mr. Box. Five hundred pounds I And a very nice
sum too.
Mr. Ballot. If my learned friend is going to give us
his opinions on arithmetic, we shall be here for ever.
Mr. Box. I will not be put down by the envious
carpings of an ignorant mind. Now what did you do
with, that money?
Witness. I spent it in beer.
Mr. Bumptious, Q.C. I will not stand this any
longer! Do you mean to say on your oath, Mr. SLIME,
that you have had seven hundred pounds' worth of beer
in a public-house?
Witness. Not in one public-house,but several.
Mr. Bumptious, Q. C. Several? How many?
Witness. Twenty-two, Sir.
Mr. Bumptious, Q. C. Twenty - two. Twenty - two
times seven hundred is naught naught, and seven times
two is,—what is seven times two ?—oh, fourteen, and
carry one, fifteen. Tou declare, on your oath, that you
have drunk beer to the value of fifteen thousand four

Mr. Ballot. I You may step down, Sir, you may step

Mr. Bumptious, Q. C. You may do nothing of the kind,

you or your town before. You have nothing to say,
Gentlemen, I hope.
Mr. Ballot. As a matter of logic
Mr. Box. I am sure we don't want to hear my learned
friend chop logic.
Mr. Bumptious, Q.C. No, nor logic chop. And that
reminds me that my chop will be overdone if I listen to
you fellows talking any longer. I am going to lunch.

well, during intervals of recreation, by the occasional exercise of his abilities in
the capacity of an amateur woodman. As such he would have cut down only
those trees which, by their rottenness, were typical of political and social abuses.
That Woodman would, of course, have spared all those other trees—the sound
and healthy timber corresponding in condition to our truly valuable and vener-
able institutions, which WILLIAM, as sincerely as anybody, desires to keep
standing.

THE ITALIAN MANOEUVRES.
(From your Military Correspondent.)
DEAR SIB,
HAVING at your special request, and at great inconvenience
to myself, attended the Military Manoeuvres of Germany and
France, I thought I might as well go down South, and see how the
Army of Italy was progressing. I do trust that my reports of Die
Deutsche and les Francois reached you, but foreign posts are seldom
to be depended upon. There stands a post, and the letters generally
remain standing in it. This, for safety, I send by hand, and the boy
will wait for an answer. Travelling abroad en prince, as befits your
Representative kostet tehr theuer, and I appeal to your soft head,
appreciative heart—pardon 1 your appreciative head, your soft heart,
and your strong right hand—please don't cross it—to reimburse me
at once.
You have doubtless read accounts of these Manoeuvres in the daily
papers. From internal evidence, I don't believe the writers of those
accounts were ever in Italy at all. I didn't see them there. They
were a great success—the Manoeuvres, not the accounts, they-were
rubbish. The King was looking very well, and highly pleased to see
me again. He said he had derived much benefit from his recent
sojourn at the watering-place of , but I told him that name
could only be mentioned as an advertisement, twenty-four words for
sixpence, and six insertions for half-a-orown. He then turned on
his heel, or, to be more accurate, on both heels, and left me. Such
is the niggardly disposition of Italians. The boy will wait for an
answer.
I will not trouble you with the military details of the Manoeuvres,
greatly doubting your ability to understand them. Suffice to say
that the main body enfiladed en echelon, the right wing throwing out
two bastions as the left, forming into demilunes, permitted the ad-
vanced guard to make a forced march of a mile. Simple as this
sounds, it takes strong steady men to do it; and the manner in which
it was done brought down loud applause from all good critics. The
men are a fine serviceable set of soldiers, and wul be heard of in
the event of a European War. First and foremost comes that crack
corps the Imagieri, so called from their head-dress, which consists
of a flat top, like to our own Lancers' head-gear, but much larger,
made of wood, and surmounted by a little white image. Each bat-
talion has a distinguishing mark, some wearing, as an image, the
portrait of the King, others a boy bearing a basket of flowers, and
others a f ac-simile of the Venus de Milo. Fine dashing men are these;
but for troops that are as steady as our own Guards, give me the
Organi Grindieri, whom nothing will make move on. Indeed, for
refusing to stir I give them the preference over our own Line; but
their uniforms, though picturesque, are ragged, and their music is,
without any exception, detestable. Some amends are, however,
made by the bright little vivandieres who accompany the Grindieri—
dark, dusky maidens, clad in the picturesque garb of Southern Italy.
I had a little flirtation with one, and her quaint answer, given in the
rich mellow Lingua 1'oscana, so tickled me. that I must give it you.
I had been admiring her eyes, and she replied, archly, "Arrah, get
along wid ye! sure you 'refhlathering me." Fine bold soldiers, too,
are the Cipaisis, the sight of whom, with their mitrailleuses, which
look like blocks of tin standing on four legs, would make the bravest
men on the hottest day feel cold. Of the minor corps I will not
trouble you with an account. But, assuring you of the extreme
regard and aifection in which I hold you, and reminding you that
the boy will wait for an answer,

[Our confidence in our Military Correspondent ia somewhat shaken. We
never got those letters from Germany or France. We pass over the military
terms—they may be right. But Imagieri, and the description of their
helmeU, remind us of the Italians who sell plaster images—and a light bursts
upon us; the others are organ-grinders, and the Cipaiiis are the sellers of
cheap ices. We have looked up our map for the address, but cannot find it.
Working it out in the Dictionary, we have come to the conclusion that it is
"Hatton Garden, Saffron Hill"! We hare been hoaxed. The boy may wait

CHAPTER XIX.
CONCLUSION.
TTE tale is now done, and it only remains for us
to pull the threads together, and say farewell
to our readers.
The Archbishop of Canterbury happening to
visit the Westminster Vivarium one even-
ing, saw Canon MATTIX going through
some hoops, flying on the trapeze, and
hanging irom the roof by a cord. He did
not wait to witness the performance of
ZAZZEGLIA flying from the Canon. He
had seen quite enough for him; and re-
turning to the shades of Lambeth Palace,
his Grace at once wrote out the following
mem.:—" Canon MATTIX last seen hang-
ing on to a flack wire. No more rope.
MATTIX suspended."
As for Bishop DOWDIE, he
was followed by his wife
through the provinces, and
though he tried to secrete
himself inside the big dnim
which was on the platform,
he was unable to elude her
vigilance. The scandal, how-
ever, was too much for Small-
Beerjester; and partly owing
to his wife's influence, and
still more to the generally
expressed wish to get this
excellent lady out of the
country, the Bishop accepted
a Chaplaincy on the Guinea Coast, where the fees are never less
than one pound one.
Mr. ARABLE makes a capital Bishop, and MORLEENA appears de-
lighted at being his wife. What her real sentiments on the subject
may be, it is impossible to ascertain, and, at the end of a novel, need-
less to inquire. The sorrows, sins, and virtues of our heroes and
heroines are your delight, my public! Nothing is so difficult as to
finish well. Tis true of a novelist's work to say.
"Nothing in hi« work became him like the leaving of it.'1
And if some critic who can cut this up will only cut this finish
down, I shall be obliged to him. But I don't see my way; and so,
having told you about most of my characters, I will simply add that
Mr. SIMON? SIMPLER still lives happily in the cathedral town,
playing the imaginary Hebrew harp every night; that Sir ISAAC
ALLPHEEZE was never paid his bill in full, and often comes down to
Small-Beerjester in the hopes of getting some of his fees, but at
present, as the Aged Card-Sharpers still keep up their practice at
the Jeremy Deedler's Hospital, it is Sir ISAAC who comes back out of
pocket and out of spirits,
leaving Mr. SIMPLER all the
better for his visit. The
OVERWATTESgo on much the
same, and have a row every
night. Once Dr. OVEHWAYTK
playfully pretended he was
rehearsing the last Scene in
Othello; but Mrs. OVEK-
WATTE, jumping up quickly,
brought the pillow down on
his head with such a thump
as made him sue for pardon,
and promise never to try the
same amusement again.
Of Mr. JOHN BOUNCE I
have already spoken. Suf-
fice it to add that after his
decease the office to which
he had succeeded after the
abdication of Mr. SIMPLER,
was abolished by special Act
of Parliament, which at one
swoop bronght to an end

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
A Oresham Lecture.
IT is no secret that of late the City Institutions have been very
roughly handled. The Companies have been accused of spending
too mnch upon eating and drinking, and too little upon technical
education. It has been said that they have squandered their enor-
mous funds upon the most useless objects; that, in fact, they are
utterly valueless. Hoping in some degree to disprove these humilia-
ting charges, I attended a Oresham Lecture.
On reaching the corner of Basinghall Street, a few nights since, I
found a Beadle in the hall of the College, apparently impatiently
awaiting my arrival. He seemed heartily pleased to see me, and
directed me to ascend a staircase leading to the theatre, in a tone
that suggested he would not have me miss a word of the Lecture to
save my life. Invigorated by his cordiality, I rushed up the well-
lighted stairs, and on the landing was received by another Beadle.
The second official was lees cheery than the first. He pointed to a
door and informed me "that was the way in." As I passed him, he
seemed to me to sigh (but this may have been an idle fancy), as if he
would murmur in my ear, "Beware I Beware! Beware!"
My first impression of (iresham College was that it rejoiced in a
plethora of gorgeously-attired Beadles. My second (after entering
the theatre) was that a Lecture upon Rhetoric, at six P.M. on a cold
October evening, in the neighbourhood of St. Martin's-le-Grand, was
not considered by a majority of the British Public as an " over-
whelming attraction." There were about twenty people present.
I entered in a solemn silence. The
Lecturer was pausing in his remarks to
gaze earnestly and sternly at a gentle-
man who was wearing his hat. For
some momenta the discourse seemed to
have come to a complete standstill.
This gave me time to look around me.
The Lecturer was attired in Academical
costume. He wore a gown and an
Oxford hood, and a College cap was
resting beside him. In fact nothing
could nave been more impressive than
what I may term his " upper man." It
is only just, however, to admit that the
effect was slightly marred by a habit
he had of keeping his hands in the
pockets of a pair of light-coloured
trousers. It may appear a little hyper-
critical to unduly insist upon such
paltry details, and I should shrink from doing so were not the
costume of the Lecturer in strict keeping with the character of his
harangue. I can only describe the bearing of the learned gentleman
as an assumption of state in an atmosphere of "Oh-any thing-will-
do-for-this-sort-of-thmg-don't-you-know." The ancient origin of
the Institution was represented by the Academical costume, and the
comfortable "little certainty" by the degage attitude and the light-
coloured trousers.
The Lecturer was addressing rather a mixed audience. There
were two or three lads with MS. books, more or less successfully
attempting to take notes. One was very industri-
ous, and I really was forced to wonder what he
could be writing. The others were calmer, and
only grew excited when they got hold of a date.
In the midst of these lads sat a very old man,
whose education possibly may have been neglected.
I say "possibly." as, from the moment of my
entering to my departure, he scribbled away as
if his fate depended upon his preserving every
syllable that fell from the lips of his instructor.
He seemed to be making up for lost time with
frantic haste, as if he could not die in peace until
he had learned—something! There was a strong-
minded female in one corner, and a pretty-looking girl in another,
and a few uninteresting loungers were scantily spread over the back-
ground. These last reminded me forcibly of the crowd of idlers who
make it a daily task to march from Wellington Barracks to St.
James's Palace to the martial strains of the Guards' Band. I do not
think that any one of them cared about Rhetoric—particularly 1
So much for the audience, and now for the lecture. The offending
hat having been removed, the orator resumed the thread of his dis-
course. He spoke in a low and melancholy tone, and apparently
had some difficulty (at times) in collecting his thoughts. Occasion-
ally he seemed to be speaking in his sleep. As I settled down into
my seat, I understood him to be disagreeing with "Mr. HALLAJI"
upon some point or other, while he claimed for " HOBBKS of Malmes-
bury" a high place in the literature of the Past. The subject, how-
ever, could not have been of absorbing interest to him, as he once
confused the modern author with the ancient writer, calling the first


plain "HAILAM," and the last, respectfully, "Mr. HOBBES of
Malmesbury." Then he paused, and slowly drank a glass of water.
Having partaken of this slight refreshment, he continued with re-
newed energy to talk about what he had said last night." But
the " spurt was soon exhausted, and he quickly resumed what I
may term his " trance" state. Once more he seemed to be lecturing
in his sleep, making long pauses now and then, as if he had entirely
forgotten what he was speaking about. I tried my best to under-
stand him, and have reason to believe that he jumped from " Mr.
HOBBES of Malmesbury" to the orators of the time of HENEY THE
SEVENTH. After some little pause, he disappointed us all by dis-
missing that reign with the remark that no oratory of that epoch
had been handed down to him. He then came to HKNBY THE
EIGHTH, and our hopes of learning something "really good" were
again aroused. The more sanguine of us may have even expected
that the Lecturer would now throw off his lethargy, pull himself
together, and do wonders with a piece of white chalk upon the black
board that stood invitingly behind him. But, alas! it was not to
be! He merely observed that he "should saynothing about the
oratory of the time of HEIJB.T THE EIGHTH." Why he elected to be
so sternly reticent, did not appear. Perhaps it was because there
were Ladies present! We forgave him, however, the disappointment
he had caused us, because he had secured our deepest commisera-
tion. He seemed so very bored and tired. Apparently, he had set
himself a task which he nobly intended to perform. That task, I
cannot help thinking, was to lecture for an hour. Probably in
furtherance of this design, he kindly intimated that he was going to
read us a speech. "It is forcible in style," he observed, "and
tolerably intelligible." He added, that it was delivered by Sir
JOHN OHEPE to the "Levellers." "The crimes of the Levellers,"
he continued, "were something like agrarian outrages." Then he
paused, and corrected himself. He was not quite sure that this was
exactly accurate j but, after all, the crimes of the Levellers had
nothing to do with Rhetoric, and therefore he would pursue the
subject no further.
It occurred to me once or twice during the Lecture that the learned
gentleman was "not sure" of several things, and rather shrank
from entering into unnecessary particulars. He continued:—" This
speech was addressed to one TAUNEH of Kent." Then he paused,
and again corrected himself. The speech was not strictly a speech,
because it happened to be a proclamation. Still, it might have been
spoken if any one had liked to read it aloud, when of course it would
have been a speech I
Having settled this point to hie own satisfaction, he commenced.
The harangue mav have been " forcible " in style when originally
addressed to Levellers, but on this occasion it certainly did not gain
much by the delivery. The Lecturer read slowly on in a perfunctory
manner—once losing his place, and " trying back "—until he came to
the line, "a marvellously tanned commonwealth." Here he paused
with an air of languid triumph—he had caught a pun! He re-
minded us that the " speech or proclamation " had been addressed to
the followers of a TANNEB, and that here was an allusion to a
"tanned Commonwealth." The play upon words was as obvious aa
it was pleasing! For a moment he seemed to be inviting us to join
him in a wild burst of almost delirious merriment, but no one
laughed, and he almost immediately relapsed into his normal air of
melancholy. But 1 could not help fancy-
ing that he was " a little hurt," for, after
reading two or three words more of the
speech in a tone of resigned disappoint-
ment, he observed, rather abruptly,
"I need not continue this further."
As he seemingly paused to consider
leisurely what he should do next, I
seized the opportunity to turn round
and regard the audience. Judge of my
horror and my shame when I found
that there were sleepers present! As I tried to recover from so
severe a shock to all my better feelings, I noticed two of the
audience making stealthily for the door!
They had scarcely quitted the theatre when others quickly fol-
lowed their example. I gathered from this that there was something
going^ on on the platform which was evidently causing profound
emotion. I turned sharply round, and found the orator reading
with an energy that argued that he had at length discovered some-
thing that exactly suited him. In a moment more the mystery was
solved. The Lecturer on Rhetoric (with the assistance of Bishop
LATIMEK) was preaching a sermon!
As I hurriedly left, the First Beadle, cheery to the last, informed
me that " it was generally over by about seven." But no, I would
not stop—I had had enough! I may be wrong, but I cannot help
fancying that quantity, rather than quality, is the distinguish! i:
characteristic (in some instances) of a Gresham Lecture.

(Vide Correspondence in the Times.)
Miss GENEVIEVB WARD, of the Prince of Wales' Theatre,
cut out from the play Forgel-mc-not the character of Rose de
Breitac, a widow, whom the Manageress considered useless, and
the Authors essential. Lord COLKKIUOE gave judgment against
Messrs. MBKIVALB and GROVE.
DID ye hear of the Widotc Bressac,
The sack
She got, and she 'a not been put back,
Good lack!
Did GENKVIJIYE
A small salary save
By bidding the Widow Bressac
To pack?
By omitting the Widow Brtttac?
The Authors complained—well they might,
Oh, quite.
With GENBViivE they did fight
For right,
But COLERIDGE thought
That they shouldn't nave fought,
That is, judging by hit legal light.
Not bright,
He hoped 'twould be " all right at night."
Let law books remain on the shelf
With delf,

To Miss WARD can say,
"If in want of a play,
You may sit down and write it yourself,
Yourself!!
You may sit down and write it yourself!"

BY JOHN RUSKIN, ESQ.
A few extracts are subjoined :—
To the Secretary of a Working Man1! Constitutional Association,
on being requested to become President of the same,
MY DEAH SIB,
MAY I politely inquire of you what, in the Devil's name, you
mean by calling yourselves a "Working Man's Constitutional Asso-
ciation t" You are working men; and as such have no more to do
with the Constitution—of which, by the bye, T. C. and myself are
the only true guardians and supporters left in all broad England,
especially myself—than you have to do with the fine old sport of
bear-baiting. 7 am a Constitutionalist, and the best of the lot; but,
dash my buttons, if I see what right you have to put yourself on a
level with me and T. C. Read my books. If yon say you can't
afford to buy them, I beg to remind, you that by abstaining for five
years from bread, beer, spirits, and tobacco, you will be quite able
to afford a volume of Furs Clavigera. If you go on to observe that
you don't know where it is sold, and that no respectable bookseller
seems to have a copy, you disclose your ghastly and brutish igno-
rance of the geographical importance of a Kentish village called
Orpington. If, farther, you cap your insolent folly by saying that
when yon do get a volume of my works, you don't understand it, I
can only say that your mind must be as defective as that of those
two poor creatures,GLADSTONE and DISRAELI. Ten thousand demons!
Not understand me! But I will be quite calm, and subscribe myself
Yours most faithfully,
To the President of a Conservative Club, on being asked to stand as
a Parliamentary Candidate for a Borough.
MY DEAR SIR,
WHO the deuce are you? However, passing over that
question for the present, I beg to assure you that you have about as
much right to ask me to stand as a Candidate as you have to make
the same request of the Prince of Darkness himself. But I tcill
stand, and you can consider your corrupt little hole-and-corner
borough honoured by my consenting to represent it. Mind, if I
don't get in, I '11 bring down a Commission, and disfranchise the
place. You are far too corrupt to deserve a Representative; but if
you return me triumphantly, why—deuce take it!—I '11 say no more
about that.
N.B.—Not more than £30 a head for watching poles. That ought
to bring me in at the head of the poll. Do you see the joke,
stupid i1 Yours devotedly,
On being invited to accept the Freedom of a City.
MY DEAR MB. MArou,
CONFOUND your impertinence I Beelzebub—who, by the
way, was quite a gentleman—is modest and unassuming compared
with your entirely dastardly impudence. Ask me to receive the
freedom of your City! Let me tell you I consider you a doosid deal
too free in making such a request. Your city has always been dis-
tinguished for two characteristics—unblushing mercantile roguery
and inveterate artistic imbecility. Besides which, I hear that you per-
sonally believe in the filthy pseudo-science which calls itself Political
Economy. Political Economy, indeed!—Political Lunacy, Political
Suicide, Political Death! Bah! Take yourself and your city and
your freedom away. Pack yourselves all off to the only place fit
for you, which I need not further particularise, and believe me to
remain Always affectionately and cordially yours,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
WILLS'S MIXTURE; OE, ALL IN THE DOWNS.
(At the St. James's.)
WILLS'S Mixture is not strong. The Meisrs. HABE and KF.NDAL
wanted a new version of DOUGLAS JKRROLD'S old play, and they
took the Wills for the deed. Mr. WILLS has re-versioned it, but
has not succeeded in (jiving the public a reversionary interest in
the new drama. Mindful of the success of Oliria, Mr. WILLS was
very naturally selected by the late manager of the Court Theatre
for similar work, under similar conditions; but Poet, as Mr. WILLS
undoubtedly is, he is no more a practical dramatist than the author
of The Falcon, and rather less of a humorist than the Laureate,
whose rollicking fun and original jokes in the above-mentioned
"idyll" were the theme of universal admiration. One whit less well
acted than it is, and its fate would have been sealed within a week,
in spite of the hysterical gush of a first-night audience, whose senti-
mental sobs have evidently influenced professional criticism. Why
will not critics determine to avoid a first night, when, at certain
Theatres at all events, it is absolutely impossible to form an un-
biassed judgment?
The First Act is dull; and even the touching episode of old Dame
Oreen asking after her dead son is only one snivel more, quite
unnecessary, as having no bearing whatever on the fortunes ot the
piece, and, therefore, a blot—unless—good heavens! it has just
struck us— this episode was intended by Mr. WILLS as "the relief I"
Where an ordinary dramatist brings in the laugh, Mr. WILLS finds
relief in tears. But the snivels are fully discounted in the opening;
after the Oreen episode, the fountains dry up.
Never, emphatically never, has Mrs. K I:N u\r. been seen to greater
advantage. She is the very model of Susan, black-eye'd, or blue-
eye'd, the honest sailor's wife. Without gush, without affectation,
without even her little mannerism of a jerky walk (which must have
been born of high heels and put off with them), she is the realisation
of the Tar's sweetheart, the heroine of all nautical ballads from
DIBDIN down to the author of " Nancy Lee." She looks the embodi-
ment—the full embodiment, too—of all that is pure and homely.
In her last two scenes she is admirable, not a gesture too much
not a tone wrong, not a note misplaced, all true to nature, all the
perfection of the art of domestic drama.
The prayer in the last scene is a mistake, because so evidently
lugged in tor the sake of "doing something" in a situation where
literally nothing remains to be done, where the less said the better,
and where the denoument should be brought about as speedily as
possible. It seems as if the managers had said "Hang it all!
we'vi' laid out so much on this scene, and made it such a perfect
model of an old man-of-war, it's a pity to chuck it away in two
minutes, before the audience have time to look at
it. But what can we do? We can't have a dance.
. . . No— happy thought—let's have a prayer!
Now, Mr. WILLS, pipe all hands to prayer. Belay!"
And so down goes Little Billee, very much as his
namesake did in THACKERAY'S ballad, when he
begged so piteously—" Oh! let me say my Cate-
chism, which my poor mother taught to me!"
Mr. KENDAL is dressed as a sailor, but looks
every inch—the gentleman. He is a Junior Lord
of the Admiralty in disguise. He is the ideal of
• i «r\ \ \ •> the William of romance—a handsome, graceful,
A HITCB IN THE perfect ideal, but, by the side of the Tar's wife,
NAUTICAL DRAMA, the homely Susan, he is only a "very superior
person "—in fact, to adapt tie evidence of one of his own messmates,
he dances and sings "like a Angel." His dancing, too, is so
evidently the result of lessons at a guinea a quarter when he
was a boy, and his style of singing shows that he has had
half-hours with the best masters, and, in all probability, a stall
at the Opera. The song itself is a
drawing-room song, and ought to have
a young lady at a piano to accom-
pany it. Did William wear a beard
in NELSON'S timer* And such a very
little pigtail? Why, William's minia-
ture pigtail must have come from a
very little pig indeed—the wee pig that
"wouldn't go to market"—but it can
be detected with strong glasses.
Mr. HARE is Admiral—we mean
Admirable—but he is thrown away,
and there is nothing for him to do. He
has chosen to be an Admiral, and there
he is. Whatever interest the audience
feel in the character is a purely per-
sonal one. We are inclined, however,
to take our own view of what that unconscious humorist, Mr. WILLS,
meant by introducing the Admiral to decorate William with an old
bronze medal which he has had by him for years, and which he


'SMALL BY DEGREES."

•NAVAL DEMONSTRATION."
hasn't been able to get rid of anyhow till now. We fancy that the
nameless Admiral—ne is only "The Admiral," like the title of
a song, in the bills—merely made the twopenny-halfpenny old
medal a canning exeuse.for coming on shore to see Susan, of. whose
beauty he had heard so much from
the sailors and Captain Crosttree. The
old slyboots—why not Admiral Sly-
boots f — seizes the first opportunity
of squeezing Susan's hand, taking care
to allay any suspicion by intimating
that there is a Mrs. Admiral at home
who has her eye on him. Old Slyboots
evidently doesn't believe in domestic
happiness from his own experience,
. and can't understand William's pro-
Sit ^L_«S\ *• ferenoe for remaining at home to going
to sea. Hewouldn't—no, not for worlds.
He gives us to under stand that when
Mrs. Admiral, with tears in her eyes, begs him to stay on shore, he
buttons up his coat, claps his three-cornered hat firmly on his head,
and exclaims, "No—I must go—England expects, &c., &c.," and
he is off, leaving Mrs. Admiral with a small cheque for the next
month's expenses, and promising to write to her from Gibraltar.
Mr. BARNES'S Captain Croistree is decidedly good for such a
brutal character. Mr. WILLS takes care to impress us with the fact
that the Captain's passion has been bubbling up for three years, and
now in two minutes it boils over—and there's an end of him till the
last Scene, when, with two very evident dabs
of powder on his cheeks to represent a state
of convalescence, he rushes on deck, and de-
livers the stolen letter and William at the
same time.
The villain Truck (who is Hatchett and
Raker and Doggrass—three single villains
rolled into one), though cleverly played by
Mr. WENHAN, is, after all, only Captain
Pigeon of the first piece—Old Cronies—in
another dress, retaining the same mannerisms
with a spice of villainy and an unconscious
imitation of Mr. JOHN RYDER'S peculiar ac-
tion with his right hand. A very important
impersonate in the piece is Susan's child, to
whom we have alluded above—
"And the youngest he was little BU1«,"
whose appearance in the first Scene is strongly TARIN° up A LnTL* Biu"
suggestive of what Master Bardell, in Pickwick, might have been
had he joined some nautical Garibaldians, and been treated to a red
shirt. The back view of little Billee becomes a trifle monotonous.
Only once we were permitted to see the cherub's full face. Susan
has brought that boy up admirably; and his discretion during the
interview was wonderful for his years.
There is a trifle too much of Rule Britannia in the music, and
it must have been a very queer sort of day when Messrs. GORDON
and HA RFORD painted their peculiar view of the sea from '' A Common
near Deal," as the horizon, owing perhaps to having
had a very rough time of Jit overnight, appears to
be dreadfully upset, and inclined to take an up-
hill course in the direction of the stage left. Per-
haps the cloth was not correctly hung, or perhaps
this is really how the two artists together actually
beheld it. Phenomenal of course; and the Scene
should have been described as "Un-common near
Deal." Perhaps it isn't Deal at all, but I-deal.
One last word about Little Billee. When his
father and mother have sent him put of the cock-
_ pit, and he'makes a dignified exit in the care of
"NOT BEFORE THE the First Lieutenant, there is heard, immediately
BOY." after his disappearance, a tremendous explosion.
Bang!! The pop of the ancient weasel is nothing to it! "What
is it P" asks the startled audience,—and a mysterious whisper goes
round the stalls, "It's the Boy I" "The Boy!" they exclaim
under their breath, shudderingly. "Yes," is the very natural
explanation, "he's got in the way, and been blown up by the
Admiral," He has, then, been a Powder Monkey in disguise. Sym-
pathy for the untimely end of Little Billee behind the scenes distracts
attention from the sorrows of William and Susan in the cockpit,
and were it not that the Boy reappears on amicable terms with the
Admiral in the last scene, no audience would ever go home satisfied.
By the way, what becomes of the villain Truck f Perhaps he be-
comes Captain Crosstree's butler. Nobody knows—and nobody cares.


THE "HEALING CLAIRVOYANTB."—On reading the report of this
case, a very superior person observed, ".Healing I Bosh f It 'B more
like 'Anwell." He was right.

LAYS OF A LAZY MINSTREL.
VII.—THE MKERT Youwa WATEH-GHIL.
AIR—Obvious.
I WAITED last Monday at Medmenham Ferry, well—
Anxious for some one to ferry me o'er:
The man was at dinner, and I
could tell very well
He would not return for an
hour or more.
So I sat me down and smoked
so steadily.
What should I do ?—I could
not tell readily.
A maiden rowed by who had
soft sunny hair,
"Whose dimples and eyes were beyond all compare:
This Water-Girl was so uncommonly fair!
But only to think, as I pondered there wearily,
And gazed at the Abbey, and thought it a bore,
She leant on her sculls, and she
offered most cheenly
To row me across to the oppo-
site shore!
I said, "How kind!" She
pouted capriciously!
I stepped aboard, and she
smiled deliciously!
And rowed off at once with so
charming an air,
And feathered her sculla with such neatness and care,
This Water-Girl was so delightfully fair 1
For once I'm in luck—there is not the least doubt of it!
Alas that the voyage is concluded so soon!
The skiff's by the shore, and
I slowly get out of it,
And wish the fair damsel " a
good afternoon."
I raise my hat. and she looks
so thnllingly!
I thank her much, and de-
part unwillingly I
She smiles, and she ripples her
soft sunny hair;


And leaves a heart broken beyond all repair!
This Water-Girl was so surpassingly fair!
THE SOCIAL SCIENCE CONGRESS.
(From our Edinburgh Corretpondent.)
Iw the Fine Arts Section Mr. DOODLE read a Paper on Hearthstones
as materials for Public Buildings. Mr. DOODLE said that when they
looked around and saw the dirty, begrimed condition of London
houses
Mr. NOODLE wanted to know how he was to look around in Edin-
burgh and see the London houses.
Mr. DOODLE said he wrote his paper in London.
Mr. NOODLE apologised.
Mr. DOODLE continued, that when they saw the dirty condition of
London houses, they must come to the conclusion that bricks and
marble and granite were quite untmited to London air. London was
very dirty. Look at the blacks.
Mr. FOODLE had looked at the blaoks._ He had seen them at the
Aquarium throwing assegais, and he quite agreed with his honour-
able friend, Mr. DOODLE, that if they got throwing their assegais at
public buildings, the blacks would be very destructive.
Mr. DOODLE said his friend had misunderstood him. He meant
blacks that came on your nose.
Mr. POODLE said that if a black came on his nose, he would knock
him down, assegai or no assegai.
Mr. DOODLE didn't mean that either. He meant things that came
down from the sky.
Mr. FOODLE thought that if his friend had said balloons at once,
it would have saved a lot of time.
Mr. DOODLE implored his hearers to think of blacks that came out
of chimneys, and fell down on your nose.
Mr. COODLE said that was very true. A black fell on his nose the
other day in Regent Street just when he was passing a very pretty girl.
Mrs. COODLE was glad to hear it.
Mr. LOODLK wanted to know what Mr. COODLE's doubtful anecdotes
of debauchery had to do with hearthstones.
Mr. DOODLE asked to be allowed to get on. They all knew that
hearthstones were the embodiment of cleanliness. They knew how
white and glistening hearthstones and water were. Well, if houses
were built of hearthstones, every shower of rain would but purify
Mr. NOOBLE said you might as well build houses of soap.
Mr. LOODLE thought that Mr. DOODLE was an ass. (Carried
nem. con.)
In the Hygienic Section, Mr. BOOEIT read a paper on Alcoholic
Stimulants.
Mr. SNOOZEY thought that this was a paper which might be
advantageously treated with experiments.
Mr. BOOZBY said that that was his intention.
Mr. LOOZET judged from the personal appearance of Mr. Boozgr
that he had already carried that intention into considerable effect.
Mr. BOOZEY despised insinations—he would say insinuations of a
base and revolting eharactiker. Now, in regard to Alcoholic Stimu-
lants, all the leading medical men were agreed that the safest,
purest, and most healthy drink was wiksey—he would say whiskey.
Mr. DOOZET said it was curious that Mr. BOOZEY had only come to
that conclusion since his brother failed on the Stock Exchange and
set up as a spirit merchant. The safest of ail drinks was Madeira—
old Madeira—such as he drank himself in his own house.
Mr. BNOOZBY said that his friend might drink old Madeira hinm^lf,
but he gave his friends uncommonly new Marsala.
Mr. DOOZEY said Marsala or Madeira, it was at any rate a better
drink than the Port-wine bought round the corner, at one-and-three
the bottle, which Mr. SNOOZKY poisoned his friends with, and said
he had had in the cellar over thirty years.
Mr. Loo/ K v said give him claret.
Mr. SNOOZEY said his friend might say "give him claret" all day
long, but he could assure him nobody was going to give him any.
Mr. COOZEY said that the worst of claret was, that if he drank four
bottles it made him as giddy as anything.
Mr. Loo/i, Y had noticed that too, and had thought of writing a
paper on it.
Mr. SNOOZEY was very glad he hadn't.
Mr. COOZEY said he would stand by champagne for ever.
Mr. SNOOZEY thought that if he was going to stand champagne for
ever, it would be more to the purpose.
Mr. DOOZEY wanted to know what had become of Mr. BOOZEY.
Mr. BOOZEY was understood to say that whenever he wanted to
do full justice to the reading of a Paper, he always lay under the
table. Would any gentleman sing a song P
Mr. LOOZEY volunteered, and the meeting hastily broke up.
In the Fiddle-Faddle Section, Mr. JOINER read a paper on London
Fogs. The reader said that it was impossible to overrate the eyils
which these November visitors brought to the Metropolis. He him-
self lived in the country, and the discomforts he experienced when
he went to London were enormous.
Mr. Ho IN KU wondered why Mr. Jo LNEK didn't atop in the country,
then.
Mr. ,101 N KK said that London Fogs were extending to the country,
that they had reached as far as Manchester.
Mr. COINEB would take the liberty of saying " Walker!"
Mr. JOLNEK said that Mr. COLNEB might add "Hookey" if he
liked, but it would have no effect on him. The fact was undeniable
that hundreds of aged persons had been killed last winter simply
through fog. Now, wasn't that a fearful thing?
Mr. MOINER, having lost a grand-aunt, from whom he had in-
herited property, last winter, implied that he didn't think it was a
fearful thing.
Mr. JOINER said the remedy was in Londoners' own hands. He
should propose a heavy tax on fire-places, and the substitution of
gas-stoves.
Mr. Cor JTEH said he would never give up his lire-place, and he
wouldn't pay taxes on it.
Mr. MOINER remembered having tried a gas-stove, and everything
cooked on it tasted of gas, until luckily the beastly thing blew up.
Mr. LOIN KK also remembered having tried a gas-stove ; only owing
to a want of confidence between himself and the Company, they cut
the gas off.
Mr. BOHTEB said that as all persons with taste were now abandon-
ing gas, and adopting wax candles, it was hardly likely that they
would consent to be poisoned by stoves.
Mr. POINER thought if a few directors of gas companies were hung,
it would do some good.
Mr. JOINEB thought the discussion growing irrelevant. They had
met to discuss fog.
Mr. COINER assured his honourable friend, Mr. JOIN KK, that no
one could be in a greater fog than he was at that moment.
The meeting then broke up angrily.

FROM a letter, penned by Mr. R. CLEMENT LUCAS, Assistant
Surgeon to Guy's Hospital, it appears that the Management Com-
mittee of that institution does not include even one medical prac-
titioner 1 Such a Hospital Committee exhibits a pretty close
resemblance to a Board of Admiralty, once possible, consisting
exclusively of landsmen, who, in their official capacity, must be
necessarily often at sea. A Committee charged with the manage-
ment of a Hospital ought to be in some measure capable of under-
standing matters of medicine and surgery; but how can it, when
it does not comprehend a Doctor?

bears me harmless, and answers all bothering questions, and takes all my fees,
and keeps 'em fur his trouble.
Our Commissioner. Are your fees of large amount?
Sheriff. Somewhere about a " thou" more or less—but I "m not quite clear on
the subject, and I don't believe any Sheriff ever is.
Our Commissioner. Have you any salary?
Sheriff. Yes, the Corporation allows me about £300 a year, some of the items
being rather curious. I or instance, the Common Council in the time of PHILIP
and MART kindly granted the Sheriffs of that day 20*. each, which amount we
still receive. In 1577 they granted for Wax, Herrings, and Sturgeon, £5 6j. Sol.
I don't use wax myself, anil don't like herrings or sturgeon, but I receive my
half of the £5 6«. 8rf.
Our Commissioner. "What strange items! Anything further of a curious
kind?
Sheriff. Yes, I am also kindly presented with some very handsome Fire
Buckets, which, I believe, are intended to enable me to extinguish any fire thai
might be accidentally caused, shortly after my'return home from one of the
many sumptuous repasts I have to attend officially.
Our Commissioner. What paternal care the City Fathers seem to display
towards you. Anything further?
Sheriff. Yes; they allow me Nine Pounds to pay the tolls on London
Bridge, but as there is no toll on London Bridge now, 1
Our Commissioner. Yes, quite so. Very natural. Anything further?
Sheriff. Well, I wear a peculiar costume—which I think rather becoming,—
and I have to swallow a great deal of green fat with my turtle. 1 ride in a
carriage of resplendent beauty. I am waited on by domestics arrayed more
gorgeously than those of Royalty itself. I am allowed to address the House ot
Commons from the Bar of the House. I go to Court, attend State Balls and
Concerts, and have always before me the possibility of a Knighthood.
Our Commissioner. Pray what are your principal duties?
Sheriff. Dining, Flogging, and Hanging.
Our Commissioner. Will you describe them more in detail?
Sheriff. Certainly. Whenever and wherever the Lord Mayor dines, there I
dine; wherever the Lord Mayor goes, there I go; whatever the Lord Mayor says, I
repeat, with a difference. In short 1 am the Lord Mayor's shadow. "We come
like shadows, so depart." I emerge from obscurity into the brilliant sunshine of
Corporation life. I bask in that sunshine for twelve short months, and I then
return into the obscurity from which I emerged, I trust, a wiser and a better
man.
Our Commissioner. Never mind the rest. Very instructive. You may
retire, Mr. Sheriff.
THE WAGS OF WATERLOO.
THE London and South-Western is usually esteemed a "safe" railway, both
as regards its dividends and its exemption from accidents—the Nine-Elms
disaster .notwithstanding. Nevertheless, the Directors of this Company may
justly be considered as holding high rank among the Practical Jokers of the age.
The mention of a few of the witticisms expended upon the traveller by them will
indubitably confirm this assertion:—
1. The Waterloo Station is so constrwsted that no voyager of ordinary
intelligence can determine the precise point of his departure. With rare
humour the Directors have so arranged the various platforms that it is quite
possible to be at Waterloo and yet to be some hundreds of yards away from the
spot whence any particular train will start. A craftily-devised medley of
barriers, bridges, subways, and iron ways, after the Hampton Court Maze
model, moreover, generally succeeds in baffling the stranger in the Waterloo
Wilderness. The only successful plan for escaping is to propitiate one of the
natives (or porters). And even these are often at a loss to determine the right
platform five minutes before a train starts. With equal jocularity the Directors
have scattered seats few and far between. Several of these resting-places are
judiciously placed over the gratings of the kitchens connected with the refresh-
ment-rooms, so that the imaginative traveller may refresh himself economically
on the savoury odours. The walls of the Station are carefully, and, it may be
added, generously adorned with the announcements of other Railway Companies.
The careful explorer will discover some few time-bills of the London and South-
western in odd nooks and corners. An arrangement whereby those who are
arriving and those who are departing from the " Loop-Line" Terminus meet in
friendly conflict, is a touch of genuine pantomimic fun.
2. Horse- and boat-racing are sources of great revenue to the Waterloo wags,
and also of infinite pleasantry. Whenever there are meetings at Epsom, Ascot,
Kempton, or Sandown, or aquatic contests at Putney or Mortfake, the fun is fast
and the jokees (or ordinary travellers) furious. The uncertain hours of arrival
and departure have all the charm of constant variety. But, furthermore, the
monotony of the journey is repeatedly broken by abrupt stoppages at not gene-
rally appreciated spots of interest, commanding splendid views over wild
expanses of tiles and chimney-pots, or embracing vistas of ploughed fields
interspersed with telegraph poles and unfinished man-
sions of the lower order. In addition to these jests,
ordinary fares between the Metropolis and the place
where the equine or aquatic sports are being held are
abolished for the time being—not to the traveller's ad-
vantage, nor with his consent. Lastly, a splendid Com-
munism is very often established, especially during the
Ascot and Derby weeks. On these occasions any well-
organised band of roughs can eject a party of Ladies
from a first-class carriage, and establish themselves
without the unnecessary ticket, for the South-Western
Directors and their merry employes humorously treat
such scenes as the fortune of uncivil war.
3. _It is evident that the Directors must be great rabbit-
fanciers, for the number of hutches scattered over their
"System" is enormous. It is only by experience that
the traveller can appreciate the irrepressible propensities
of the South-Western Company when he finds out that
these hutches are not for rabbits, but for human beings,
and that they are technically known as "Country Sta-
tions." Most of them are adorned with texts, but every
one has a pigeon-hole for the reception of the customary
tribute. A long wait in any of the South-Western
hutches is one of the most excruciating jests which any
Company of Practical Jokers could practise. However,
Christmas is coming, so Clowns in want of a few comic
scenes would do well to visit this rare field of Waterloo.
THE BREWERS AT ISLINGTON.
A BREWERS' Exhibition, one would think,
Should be a show peculiar to the Trade,
Chiefly of every sort and kind of drink
From malt and hops through fermentation made;
Beer under all its forms, of local fame,
Or popular by individual name.
Burton and Rennet, Welsh and Scottish ales;
Barclay and Perkins's Entire—the best
Which they and firms whom space to mention fails
Brew likewise—Truman, Hanbury, and the rest,
Merchants of porter, heavy wet and stout,
Aloft the sky whose tavern-legends flout:
Materials used in brewing too; those twain
In making genuine beer employed alone.
None of your shams; no produce of the cane,
No quassia, by true British Brewers shown.
No drugs; nought save the ingredients of pure beer,
Sound, unadulterated, and sincere.
Models and plans of " Plant" you might expect,
In order, to behold disposed or hung;
Boilers, and vats, and tuns withal, select
Utensils; barrel, tub, and tap, and bung.
And ah, 'midst all that good old-fashioned gear,
The modern beer-engine that mars good beer!
And carved or moulded forms of Brewers' men,
Types of the Drayman famed in comic song,
And those big Brewers, to the Upper Ten
Thousand, as Brewer Princes, that belong;
The legislative Brewers, who represent
Beer's interests in Britannia's Parliament.
But who, at any Brewers' Exhibition,
Could ever have expected to appear
All manner of beverages in competition,
As non-intoxicants, with Brewers' beer,
Such as of late may have been viewed, on call,
In Islington, at Agriculture's Hall?
Can Brewers have taken Temperance Drinks to brew,
Meeting the times, to suit the taste of such
Good folk as those malt liquor that eschew,
And, in their oupa, can't take a drop too much?
As well as beer, do breweries now supply
The draughts that not inebriate, for the dry?
Or do the Men of Beer design to show
How little they the opposition dread
Of mineral waters, lemonade, and so
Forth, to the potions that excite the head;
And do they back beer still to hold its own
'Gainst mimic fizz, and pop and zoedone?

APPROPRIATE ADDITION TO THE
CITT ABMS. — A (Temple) Bar
Sinister!
THE SOCIETY FOR THE EXTERMINATION OP
MUSIC AND DANCING.
THIS Society held its one hundred and thirtieth Annual Meeting
at the Sessions House, Clerkenwell, on October 14th and 15th, under
the presidency of Captain MORLEY, who was supported by Major
LTON, Mr. SHARPE, and about fifty out of four hundred other Med-
dlevex Magistrates. The representatives of the four millions of
Londoners appeared with becoming humility before this August, or
rather October, assembly, and asked meekly for permission to occa-
sionally sing a song, or play upon the flute, or dance a dance, or
witness others dancing.
The Society, not being quite clear as to whether its powers applied
to', the pubbc as dancers, or the public as witnesses of dancing,
wisely fenced with that part of the question, but expressed a strong
conviction that no person ought at one and the same time to indulge
in the luxury of music, dancing, and singing. Having all the police
inspectors from A to Z in one box before them, they took the oppor-
tunity of scolding these gentlemen for not watching and reporting
upon any infringement of this and similar rules. Being somewhat
irritated by their own remarks, they then took away a music and
dancing licence from a deaf old gentleman that had been granted
probably for the last eighty years, and refused another licence
because certain technical "notices" had not been properly served
on churchwardens, overseers, clerks of peace, clerks of vestries,
clerks of petty sessions, houses, station-houses, cheesemongers,
trunk-makers, bill-stickers, and paper-hangers.
After granting a licence to Exeter Hall, without a word about its
notoriously dangerous exit, they raised a discussion about a trumpery
staircase at the Scapegoat Music Hall. Having swallowed such a
camel as the Polytechnic, where " Stage-plays," so called, are nearly
always being represented without authority, they strained at such
a gnat as a representation of African warfare at the other end of
Whitechapel, and patroniaingly granted a licence for Music to the
Royal Academy of Music, whose Directors, by the way, if they only
knew it, are quite independent of this Society for the Extermination
of Public Amusements. One member of the Society thought that it
would be better if all persons could be sent to bed at nine o'clock,
but he did not press his conviction; and another member insisted
that the refined and refining Soldier should be admitted without
scruple to every entertainment. This last idea was received with
great enthusiasm; but no suggestion was made as to who was to pay
tor the Soldier. The Press were ordered to take notice of the idea,
and we obey the order.
After a fruitless attempt to get the Royal Aquarium into hot
water, and to prove that the only thing fishy about it is its manage-
ment, the Directors were given another year's grace; but. the
Town Hall of Shoreditoh was warned that it had committed a
crime by allowing the Stabat Mater to be played on an"Ash Wed-
nesday. When it was pointed out that the Meddlevex Magistrates
had no power to bar such a performance, or any performance, on
that particular day, Mr. SHARPE, who is as sharp as vinegar,
seemed to indicate that the will of the Magistrates was above all
law—
You mustn't do uch
Near the bells of Shoreditch,
though you may do it at the Albert Hall, and on the Surrey side of
the water.
After a few dozen music licences had been granted to "coffee
palaces "—the new pets of the professional philanthropists—a licence
was refused to the Trocadero Caff, and a chance lost of partly
clearing the top of the Gaymarket. Such is the difference between
coffee and cafe. EVANS'S was once more restored to life after a
year's trance, but the owner was not to have the privilege ac-
corded to the late Paddy GREEN of entertaining duchesses unawares.
It is now to be a strictly monastic institution.
Having inflicted as much inconvenience as possible on the public,
the Meddleyex Magistrates adjourned for a year. The beauty of
this Licensing System is that if any wrong is done, it cannot be
remedied for a twelvemonth. On the other hand, if any licensee
abuses his licence, he cannot be punished for a twelvemonth. The
Act of Parliament (25 Oeo. II. cap. 36), having been passed' about
1750, is admirably suited, of course, to the wants of 1880.
Will these Meddleyex Magistrates meet again next October? Un-
questionably. Will it take twenty years' agitation, a riot, and the
march of one hundred thousand men to Westminster to get rid of this
society, and put our Licensing System on a sound and sensible foot-
ing? Probably. The ancient Assyrians worshipped the Bull, and
other nations have adored a variety of animals. In England we
worship the Jackass.

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
URE emit', one of the best
dinners as I ever assists
at is what they calls'' the
feast of Love and Peace"
at the Merohint Taylors.
From what I oan un-
dustand from the Wash-
upfool Master's speech,
it seems that the Tailors
and Skinners had a jolly
fight in Cheapside, ever
BO many underd years
ago, and lots on 'em was
killed on the street of
batel. and all about
which should go fust in
the Lord Mare's Sho!
Well, they was all had
np before the Beak, and
he must have been some-
think like a Beak, for he
ordered 'em not to make
such fools of themselves
again, but to take the
leed one after the other
on diIlirink years, and to
ask each other to dinner
every year like Xtian
Gents. And so they did,
and so they have done
ever since, I think the Master said 396 times each, and so they does
now, and so I hopes they '11 keep on doing till Waiters is no more!
The Master of the Skinners replied like a Man, that he hoped both
Kumpennies would shew their good sense and usef ulnis by givin as
many dinners as posibel. Ah that's the sort of Master for my
money. BROWN whispered to me, "Amin to that sweet prare."
I heard the Amerikun Ambassidoor who was prisint, say, "he was
blowed if that jolly fight mustn't have took place before Kristifer
Klumbus diskuverd his grate Country, and he wished as all batels
was follered by such jolly results, only it might inkuridge people
to go to war if it came to be known that a little scrimmidge in
Cheapside had perduced nearly 800 scrumpshous dinners such as this
here one."
Ah! how many things is changed since that time I Hempires is
cum and gone, Taverns is changed, and Eddioashun is become
ginrul.
What I loves, almost as much as Old Madeery, is to see the
gushin and effectionet Loyalty as is shown when any of the Royal
Familly dines with the Copperation. It isn't only that they stands
and stares at 'em with hor and admirahsun wile they 're there; for
BROWN says, in his imperent way, "The Swells does that as well as
the Snobs:" but, drektly they goes, there's such a rush of Loyalty
to the Tables when Royalty has had its dinner, as almost draws
tears from my eyes.
They sits on the Chairs where they sat; they gobbles up the bits
of fruit left on their plates: they snatches up the Flowers they smelt
at, and runs off with the Menoos as they handeld. BROWN, with his
usual bad taste, says it's all Flunky ism; but I says it's true
ginine Loyalty to the Throne and 11 altar; and while them noble
Principals is thus shown, Old England has nothing to fear from
swearing Demi-Gogs.
I offen thinks from what I sees, that it must be very trying to one
of the very Middling Classes to have to go through his aooties as a
Master of a Great Compenny. I wonder what his feelings is after
entertaining, say, a Royal Prince, and a couple of Dewx, and a brace
of Bishups one day, and the next day having to serve in his shop.
I don't know a better bit of fun than to see some imnint Swell,
praps a Lord or a Barrinit, a larffing and a chatin and a drinkin
away, and thoroughly enjoying hisself, and presently up I goes to
him and I says, says I, please Sir you will have to rispond to the
next Toast but 2. Oh to see the suddin change! Why some on
'em's so took a back that they seems reddy to feint and almost
grasspin for breth. No more larffin for them, I can tell you, but
capital fun for BROWN and me to watch 'em.
On the other hand them as is used to it, likes it, and is as savage as
Bares if they ain't called on. Only the other nite at the Manshun
House one of the Guvernmint asked me what he would have to
do, and when I said nothink Sir this evenin, he got up and went
away quite pail with anger.
Such is Life! Them as wants somethink don't get it, and them as
gets it don't want it. (Signed) ROBERT.

Most exigent one!
I have an idea
Thou pokest thy fun.
Oh! is it thy will
To make noodles of us,
By urging us still
So to worry and fuss
Concerning our bodies,
What's eaten, what's drunk,
Until we 're mere noddies
In chronic blue funk P
Hygie'a. thou 'rt clever;
But, 'twixt you and me,
To fidget for ever
Is fiddle-de-dee.
We mustn't eat this,
And we mustn't drink that,
Lest sound health we should miss,
Grow too thin, or too fat,
Must go in for analysis
Of all "grub "about
Lest we court cramp,' paralysis,
Fever, or gout;
Mustn't travel by rajl,
Must shun riding in cabs;
Must,—but time would quite fail
To tell half of thy " fads."
If a mortal (I think)
Could such vigilance keep,
He would ne'er eat or drink,
He would ne'er toil or sleep.
Sanitas sanitation
Is all very fine;
But my ultimatum
Is this—I must dine!
And if I stop grubbing
Till all's fair and clear,
I shall do nought but "tubbing"
For many a year.
^Ksculapins' daughter,
With thee I agree,
Pure air and cold water
Are needful to me;
But perpetual worry
'Bout stomachs and nerves,
And this, that, and 'tother,
No good purpose serves.
"Nine Systems," Hygiea,
Perhaps I possess,
Though I 'd an idea
The number was less.
But to square work and feast
By the rules thou art giving,
Would take nine lives at least,
And not one much worth living.
FRIENDS IN LEEDS.
•
SIR,—You told me to go to Leeds, and I told you to go to Jericho.
You didn't go to Jericho, and I didn't go to Leeds.
Who needs
To go to Leeds?
when he oan do as I did, and always intend to do in future. I
simply—very simply—sat in my little second-floor back-room, with
one end of a Telephone fitted up to my study-table, the other being
attached to Dr. ARTHUR SULLIVAN, who went off with it to the
Leeds Festival, and took it with him on the platform. Did you
ever hear of a Telephone being attached to a person? They do, I
assure you, become deeply attached—like cats, however, more to
places than persons. Of course it was a brilliant idea of mine—
(yon, Sir, never thought of it)—to put the Telephone into AHTHTTR
SULLIVAN'S head—in at one ear and out at the other—because, as
everyone knows, he is such a perfect Conductor of sound. It
succeeded marvellously. I heard everything; and was charmed
with BARNETT and BENNETT, and April Fool and Shipping the
Builder, and that ancient Conservative musician, the Hoary Tory
O! Where all was so good, and so much was OSGOOD, and where
one thing was os good as another, as the Telephone said—(I heard
by Telephone all the jokes, made totto voce on the platform, but
shan't tell of one of 'em)—it is impossible to discriminate. Dr.
SULLIVAN'S prescriptions, for an opening symphony to a tonic, were
most successful. The learned author of Pinafore did the words
of the Martyr of Antioch, and the Telephone gave me a few par-
ticulars which the general public was not privileged to hear.
The great song rather reminded me of something in Trial by Jury
and Pinafore; it is called "I'll tell you how I came to be a
Martyr," with chorus. The refrain of the next most popular
number is „ In Bpite of all temptation.
From some denominations,
I remained a Christian.
(Triumphantly) I remained a Christian.'
This, with the magnificent accompaniment to which it is set,
created a profound sensation—
"A most profound sensation
From the grand instrumentation
Of Doctor Sulliran—
Of D-o-o-octor Sul-ul-ul-»-t-«»."
Well, if Sir ARTHUR—(is the Telephone correct, or did it say Dr.
ARTHUR? Odd I I thought it whispered "Sir,"—but perhaps it
said "Sir" to me)—if Dr. ARTHUR SULLIVAN, isn't satisfied with
the result of our spirited telephonic experiment, he ought to be.
But if everyone can hear musical festivals by Telephone, why go to
Leeds, or anywhere else ?—except as an excuse for an outing—out
on the Leeds. Adoo! BOUNCER.

tion that wasn't strictly authentic; yet as he has only just returned
to Town from Dartmoor, and his imagination sometimes is known
to run away with him. we are a little bit surprised how he has got
hold of the subjoined most important documents. However, we
suppose it's all right:—
Earl Gr-nv-Ue to Mr. Gl-dft-ne.—Very sorry to bother you, but
unless I clearly understand how far you intend to carry this idiotic
Naval Demonstration. I really must resign.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne to Earl Gr-nv-Ue.—Can you clearly understand
anything P—that's the question. Everything will come right. Leave
it to me.
Earl Gr-nv-Ue to Mr. Gl-dst-ne.—Just what I refuse to do. Am
I Foreign Secretary, or not? Usurpation of three Offices by the
Head of the Government is an unheard-of and unconstitutional
anomaly. Wire back whether I 'm Foreign Secretary or not, and
whether I can use my own discretion in Eastern business.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne to Earl Gr-nv-Ue.—Of course you're Foreign
Secretary—look it up in Whitaker. Use your own discretion by all
means, but come to me before you do anything. That's all.
Sir Ch-rl-s D-lke to Mr. Gl-dst-ne.—I don't like making a fuss,
but really must resign unless we punch the SULTAN'S head inslanter.
G-JIB-TTA quite agrees with me.
Mr. Br-ght to Mr. Gl-dst-ne.—Rumours of Coercion and Bom-
bardment. Wire back if true. If true, I resign. Can't stand quite
all that, you know; must keep up appearances, "peace at any
price," &o.
Mr.
"at any
large piece—so
SULTAN—all's going well, couldn't be better.
Mr. F-rst-r to Mr. Gl-dst-ne.—Unless you call Parliament to-
gether at once, and get Habeas Corpus suspended all over Ireland, I
really must think about—resigning.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne to Mr. F-rst-r.—" Et tu, Brute!" Ireland not
half so bad as yon imagine—distorted imagination—wait for Irish
Land Bill—prosecute PARNELL, &c., if you must do something.
Mr. F-rst-r to Mr. Gl-dst-ne.—Am I Irish Secretary or not?
Which is most likely to know about Ireland, yon in Downing Street,
or I in Phcenix Park?
Mr. Gl-dit-ne to Mr. F-rst-r.—I guessed your riddle at once. I
in Downing Street, of course. Try another.
Lord S-lb-rne to Mr. Gladstone.—I say, how about the Land?
No revolutionary changes, please. Don't mind CAIRNS s old bills-
hut, a step further! and—I resign.
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n to Mr. Gl-dst-ne.—Hope you're going on with
Land Bills for next Session. Give it the landlords hot. Don t mind
old S-LB-ENE; he's a reactionary. Buy up all the land m the
country—that's the plan—and sell it again to people. Buy cheap,
and sell dear; thus you combine Statesmanship and true commercial
principles. If you don't do this, I need hardly say that I shall be
forced to—resign.
After this, the PREMIER quitted Downing Street hastily, our Cor-
respondent informs us, and left strict injunctions that no letters or
telegrams were to be forwarded to him for the next month. His
E resent whereabouts is unknown, even to his nearest and dearest
riends.

Monday.—Yesterday's rest and attendance at my favourite place
of worship, has wonderfully refreshed me. Feel fit for anything.
Lay in a little more gunpowder, as people are getting so absurdly
suspicious and will insist on keeping loaded firearms in their bed-
rooms, a most dangerous practice. Also inspect my jemmies,
knuckle-dusters, and skeleton-keys, and clean my favourite revolver
for night-work. Think about purchasing some dynamite. Would
it assist me? Fill up my list of engagements for the week, which
includes some pretty little pieces of business in the suburbs.
Tuesday.—Good swag yesterday. Rather unpleasant work, though.
Found five bull-dogs in the hall, who flew at me. Shot them all,
then with last barrel was obliged to shoot a youth, who very injudi-
ciously displayed objections to my being in his room at 2 A.M. with
a revolver and blackened mask on. No accounting for tastes. All my
co-pals say I look extremely well in the mask. What shall it be
to-night? One of the new steel-plated burglar-proof villas at
Blackheath, I think.
Wednesday.—Easily got into the burglar-proof villa—pretty
house inside, tastefully furnished, called "Rose Villa"—pretty
name, too. A curious incident occurred. I had collected several
watches, clocks, valuable pictures, bracelets and other jewellery, on
the grass-plot in front of the house, when who should come by but
a policeman! Never so astonished in my life. Hadn't seen one for
years. Quite taken aback. He immediately evinced a desire to
make my further acquaintance—which, considering how occupied I
was at the moment, was in excessively bad taste, I thought. How-
ever, I put two bullets in his leg, carried off my booty in a cart
which was waiting for me outside—never mind who was driving it 1—
and arrived at home, I regret to say, rather tired, owing to the
labour of collecting so much material. Shall rest to-morrow, and
send to inquire after the policeman, whose number I took before
leaving.
Friday.—Last night did a very stylish little piece of work.
Bobbed SPT/BOEON'S house 1 Not so much for the swag, as to create

one or two—especially one very eloquent discourse on "Theft."
Returned the whole lot,—with compliments on the admirable lan-
guage of the one I have mentioned,—apologising for their temporary
abstraction. Shall really think about giving up my pew—quite
disgusted.

[OOTOBEB 30, 1880.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MARY AND MABEL.
WE were congratulating ourselves on baring seen everything worth
seeing in London just now in the theatrical line, when a couplet
suddenly whizzed through one ear and out of the other, and then
back again. -_ It was something about—
"She may walk in gay attire,
And Schiller has to spare."
We may be wrong in the quotation, hut the jingle reminded us not
of Mr. IRVTNG as Louis dei Pranchi at the Bal Masque, but of LEWIS
DE WLNGFIELD'S adaptation of SCHILLER'S Mary Stuart at the Court
Theatre. Mary Stuart is a Tragedy in Five Acts—the last axe being
the clim-axe—and, with the exception of the cheerful play of The
Gamester, it is one of the tragedies! tragedies we ever remember to
have seen. _ The only gay thing in it at all is Fptherin-gay, and that
exists but in the name. It is gloomy, but it it never dull. If the
blank verse seldom rises above an ordinary level, it is at least neither
pretentiously stilted nor sentimentally gushing.
As is the dialogue so is the acting throughout. It is well played
all round, but no one is great. Madame MOIIJISKA herself, from
first to last, enlists our sympathy, but only once rouses our enthu-
siasm. In the First Act she seems to throw away "points " in a
reckless manner, as though she either disdained the ordinary modes
of dramatic appeal to the public, or were reserving herself tor some
grand tour de force, which in that particular Act never comes.
It is not till the
Third Act that
Madame Mov-
.'ESKA selects
her opportu-
nity. This is in
the finely con-
ceived inter-
view between
the two Queens,
the vindiotive
persecutor and
her hapless'vic-
tim, when Mary
of Scotland,
stung beyond
endurance by
Elizabeth's cow
ardly taunts,
turns on her
oppressor, and stabs her to the heart with the one word, "Bastard!"
This speech was magnificently given, and would have told with
treble its effect had the representative of Elizabeth looked more
regal and less like a circus rider, who, having finished some tricks
with her highly-trained steed, had stepped out of the booth, still in
costume and with a second-hand whip in her hand, to take the air
in Fotheringay Park. BETSY would not have fled before Mary's just
indignation, though she might have brought down that second-hand
whip smartly on Leicester's shoulders—just to teach him not to lay
such a trap for her again.
It is only in this situation
that we consider Miss
MOODIE'S Elizabeth as un-
Elizabethan. In the sub-
sequent Act her signing
Mary's death-warrant is
just within an ace of being
a very fine piece of acting.
Madame HKLKNA Moo-
IKSKA wins all hearts—just
as MA KT Queen of Scots did
—when she takes that touch-
ing farewell of her Ladies,
in which words go for no-
thing, and the action for
everything. It was a diffi-
cult tragedy to finish; but,
following the rule that the
horrors ought to take place " without," Mary, lost to all thoughts of
earth, walks slowly off the stage, repeating the " De Profundii," and
her voice is heard in the distance, plaintively repeating the Psalm up
to the word "Misericordia," while that detestable Dudley—deadly
rather than Dudley—acts as a sort of showman of tableaux, de-
scribing to the weeping women what is taking place behind the
scenes on the scaffold. Presently he pauses, turns away, says
"Mary sleeps "—or words to that effect—and the audience sit for a
few seconds, after the slow descent of the curtain, utterly appalled
by the tragic finish which, "long expected," has " come at last,"
though, somehow, up to the latest moment there was still a hope
that Mr. WiNQFlELD had tempered history with poetic justice, and

"BETSY" JUDOBD HI MARY'S "CRITERION."

would bring back somebody—say Shrewsbury—with a reprieve,
would then discover that Sir Edward Mortimer ;was "no j more
dead than Captain Crosttree in
Slack-Eyed Susan, would send off
the Earl of Deadly and Lord Sully
—to instant execution, when Ma-
dame MODJESKA could have mar-
ried Mortimer, who would then
have given her the entire right of
playing his Heartsease in town or
country for nothing. But this does
not happen, and Mary—alas I—is
executed.
Madame MODJESKA has achieved
a success, and Mr. WINQFIELD has
shown up Our Precious BKTST in
her true colours for once. Mr.
JOHN CLAYTON plays Dudley, and
looks burly. The Earl of Shrews-
bury is a strong BEVERIDQE, and Lord Surleigh has his PBICE, who
plays most carefully what might so easily and so soon be Burleigjh-
esque'd. Mr. CLIFFORD COOPEE isja good <Sir Amias Paulet, with
just a touch of the Lord High Chamberlain of old-fashioned extra-
vaganza, who always had to " exit dancing." If he had only been
allowed to do this occasionally with Miss Gin u;i> as Hannah
Kennedy, there would just be a ray of relief.
We are glad to see that The World's able critic, "D. C.," U still
to continue at his post. We should have been sorry to have hoard
that he was " D. C"-eased.
MR. HAY'S first and last design in his New and Original Domestic
Drama of Mabel appears to have been to puzzle his audience, and
seldom in these days has success so completely crowned the efforts of
the dramatist I But much as he has puzzled us, he seems to have
puzzled himself yet more, if we may
judge by his own synopsis of his own
plot which has come into our hands,
and is certainly about as complete an
illustration of the art how not to do
it ai could be seen even nowadays.
The name belies the play. 'Tis a
pretty, simple, bread-and-butter sort
of name enough, but good Lord! (as
honest PEPYS would have said) to see
the load of intrigue and villainy that
underlies it! Miss Mabel is a two-
fold young person—two single young
ladies rolled into one—a live Mabel
and a dead Mabel. Part of the time
the dead one is the living one, and
part the living one is the dead; and
the great point of the play is to dis-
cover when Miss CABLOTTA ADDISON,
who is both, is one, and when she is the other. Quite a Corsioan
Sister puzzle. There is plenty of stuff in the piece (the word need
not be taken sarcastically), but unfortunately it is stuffed with Hay.
It is an Olympic game. All Mr. HAY'S characters are burdened
Hi a dark, mysterious past; and this
past is Hayzy. The comic servants,
too, are a nuisance—and herein Mr.
HAY is true to nature, as a comic ser-
vant in real life would be intolerable.
There are, of course, some comic ser-
vants off the stage, but their comicality
is generally unintentional, and is cal-
culated rather, in the words of the
Bard, "to make the judicious grieve"
than laugh. "Flesh and blood can't
stand this mystery!" says the comic
maid-servant at a particularly excru-
ciating crisis, when iperplexity is fast
diverging into wrath, and the audience
are with her to a man.
Some of the Actors, too. are as
tiresome as the play. JReamund, a
stone-cutter (Mr. ANSON), has too much to'say and do. Gaintford,
the other villain, is a bore, though this is not so much Mr. VEBNON'S
fault as his misfortune. But why, having the strongest reasons for
wishing to escape observation, does he array himself in a garb which
would infallibly insure his being arrested at sight in any town on
the civilised globe P Miss CAELOTTA ADDISON is over-weighted as
Mabel, and the other CAELOTTA—CABLOTTA LECLEBCQ—dear me,
oughtn't she to be at Montgiron's Supper Party at the Lyceum I or
is it now a trifle too late P Well, well 1

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAKIVAEI.
THOUGHTS
BY
I.
A SITTER.

AH a public character, poet, politician,
mayor of Rottenborough, philosopher,
chairman of a public company, no
matter what, and I had been re-
quested by a deputation (of my wife
and daughters) to have my portrait
painted; as to who was to pay for it
that is not your business, gentle
reader (though almost everything
else in this veracious narrative will
be made so. as you will presently
find), but the affair of Mr. PATTL
VENEER, R.A., solely. If the money
had not been paid, however, I doubt
if PAUL would have sued for it. I
can fancy that gentleman under
many aspects; as a Master of the
Ceremonies to a party of Celestials
(not Chinamen, but the real ones); as
an Ambassador Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary with
Powers; as President of the Imperial Society for the Establishment
of Woman's Eights; his gravity and graciousness would eminently
qualify him for any of those posts, but as a complainant in a court
of law I can not imagine him. If I had declined to pay him, he
would, I am persuaded, have only bowed, settled his spectacles on
his fine nose, and said, "Just as you please, my dear Sir." I can
fancy him afterwards alluding to the circumstance with refined
hilarity. "People have tuch different ways of doing business.
JOKES does not pay for his picture. He sits for nothing1. Bnt after
all, there are people who require money for sitting. Perhaps he is
right. "Who knows? It is to funny."
That PATTL has an extensive charity for all mankind, may be
therefore taken for granted; and it is still more limitless as regards
the Ladies. When pushed on such matters he has confessed that he
has doubts of the existence of crime itself, as crime. "Perhaps,
Messieurs, the assassins have a moral code of their own—think it is
wicked not to go about killing people. Who knows P"
This gentleness and elasticity in morals is of considerable advan-
tage to the painter. He welcomes to his studio the Professional
Beauty; the Monarch of Finance; the Disreputable Aristocrat, with
the same grave sweetness of demeanour that he lavishes on the
Public Benefactor and the Eloquent Divine. He assists them on to
his raised platform—it is about the size of a railway turntable—with
the same respect, and puts them to the _torture with the same en-
raging indifference. I say torture advisedly. The punishment of
the rack may possibly have been worse than that of his platform,
but, at all events, it could not have lasted so long, >» Whenever I
think of it, it reminds me of the old dreadful sentence of pressing to
death. "As much as they can bear—and more." Good heavens 1
can anyone who has not had his portrait taken by an R.A. have any
notion of the ordeal?
I say "by an R.A.," because it is probable that the lesser lights
of the artistic world have not bis appliances, which undoubtedly
increase the terrors of the operation. The torture chamber is
immense. It is filled with the skeleton forms, in a more or less
advanced stage of completion, of those who have suffered before
and'will suffer after you. Human nature would not endure that
you should be taken and done with. Morning after morning you
have to sit and suffer, but there must needs be occasional intervals,
mornings Con which you wake, and, like an exhausted Speaker,
thankfully exclaim, "This morning I am not to sit." On that day
the Professional Beauty, perched on that unenviable throne (it is on
castors}, the Financial Robber, the Debauched Aristocrat, reflect or
their mis-spent lives, and whither they are leading them. On that
day the Public Benefactor and the Divine derive what comfort is
possible to them from the remembrance of virtuous actions and the
consolations of philosophy, while you, for the moment, are free.
Apprehensions of the future it is, however, impossible to banish;
and at the social board, or beside your beloved object, or (perhaps) in
the contemplation of your innocent children, a still small voice
embitters all with, "Thursday is your day, my fine fellow; on
Thursday once more you must return (metaphorically) to 'sulphur-
ous and tormenting flame.' On Thursday VENEKB will be waiting
for you."
Besides the platform which raises, or depresses you (and especially
depresses you), to meet VENEER'S convenience, and bring you dowi
to his level as he stands at work, there is an "arrangement,"—I
cannot call it a " harmony."—of gigantic blinds across the skylight
by which a flood of light is made to play upon your imperfections
With this fierce radiance beating about the "Throne," your eyes
kept very wide open to it (like those of RESUT.US tinder treatment bj
the Carthaginians), and your countenance in a state of oonstrainec
composure, though expected to assume the liveliest expression on
he shortest notice—(" More animation, if you please, Mr. JONES; a
ittle more fire in the glance; thank you")— you may understand
that " The Sitter's " lot is not a happy one.
You can endure for ten minutes, however, what you can't for
iwenty, and still less for hours; and no one who hasn't tried it can
conceive the melancholy engendered by staring in a straight line at
in almost inanimate object (namely,
VENEER. R.A.) morning after morn-
ing, while he endeavours to reproduce
>u upon canvas.
"My dear Mr. Jpiras," he once
confided to me, "I am the last man
x) complain of a Sitter; but I have
noticed that, after the first hour, your
usually expressive features vanish;
:hey absolutely disappear as in a
dissolving view; you have no face."
"My dear Mr. VENEER, I think it
is very probable," was my frank
reply. "I don't feel as if I had any."
The mere features I conclude were
still there, but all expression had
vanished from them. On the other
hand, it seemed to strike inwards
(like a chill to the liver), and in-
creased (if possible) my natural
talents for moral and social reflection. I don't think I ever
bhought so much, or so admirably, as while I was under the scalpel—
I mean the brush and palette—of Mr. VENEER. I fled from him, as
it were, and from all his dreadful paraphernalia, into the depths of
my inner consciousness. I pondered upon all sorts of things that
affect the well-being (and otherwise) of humanity; I recalled all the
strange adventures I had ever had, and the queer people I had ever
met; I elaborated whole systems of philosophy and morals; only,
when VENEER, R.A., startled me with his " A little more animation,
Mr. JONES!" I woke as from a dream which I was unable to recall,
or piece together again. Hence, these "Thoughts of a Sitter"—
much better, of course, than the hasty reflections of a mere by-
stander—are somewhat fragmentary Torsos.

LEAVES FKOM A CONTEMPLATIVE CABBAGE.
So this is Mud-Salad Market.'is it? Well, Man t« a mystery 1
Nature I can understand a little, but humanity is a conundrum that
even a Cabbage must "give up." A Cabbage is by nature and
circumstance a philosopher. A iChaldean in his watch-tower had no
better opportunity for-undisturbed cogitation than your still sturdy
growing Cabbage in the middle of a ten-acre field during the long
hushed hours of sunny summer days, and starry autumn nights.
We and the oysters are the only thinkers now. I wonder what an
Oyster would think of this!
Modern Babvlon is a big blunder I Man's civic masterpiece is a
huge dirty muddle! A Cabbage is not to be blinkered by use and
wont, and doesn't care a defunct caterpillar for " vested interests.
A vested interest is a sort of social strait-waistcoat, which its
victims put up with till they think it part and parcel of nature. I
once knew a Cucumber, who would have it that the glass tube he
was grown in was his own exterior integument. I have heard of
girls brought up to believe that they were born in corssts. But that
may have Deen a cabbage-garden joke—mere cabbage (s)talk, so to
say. If men could only look at this Brobdingnagian Dust-hole,
unblinded by custom, and prescriptive privilege, like a clear-
headed, sound-hearted Cabbage, how soon they'd make a clean
sweep of it! Are their eyes dulled by long winking at favoured
nuisances, their noses "aborted" (as DABTVIN would say) by prac-
tical disuse? Oh, for the wholesome odour of fresh, moist earth, or

flowers haven't a chance; their fragrant breathings are as impotent
to perfume the fetid atmosphere as a sprinkle of lavender-water to
deodorise Tophet. Flowers, fruits, vegetables, earth's sweetest,
purest, cleanest produce, stored for the use of the humanity they
serve here, where all is dirt, disorder, and disgustfulness!

of place here, though, as a Peri in a pigstye! Peri I Dear me
is that a female Peer? It never struck me before. Oh, impossible!

ALICE IN BLUNDERLAND.
THE Gryphon carefully slid off its pedestal, and sat down beneath
the hoarding. Then it chuckled: "What fun!" said the Gryphon,
half to itself, half to ALICE.
"What it the fun?" said ALICE.
I' Well^I can't exactly tell you," said the Gryphon, "for I 'm
'now, and I'm fresh to it. But there is a
jofce^somewhere—that 1 'm certain of; for when I 'm up there I see

em laughing on the tops of the omnibuses."
"Dear me I" said ALICE, getting quite interested. "Then it
must be a very good joke indeed."
"Well, if it is, /didn't make it-there 1" retorted the Gryphon,
quite annoyed. Then it added, more thoughtfully, "Unless it's the
sheet. But yon had muoh better ask the Mansion House Turtle.
It's more likely it's his. He's always making 'em. He knows a
thing or two, he does," added the Gryphon, with a wink.
"Then, if he's a wise turtle." rejoined ALICE, " he "s sure to know
his own joke, isn't he? We '11 ask him."
At that moment the Mansion House Turtle emerged from Fleet
Street, and joined the party. He gave a satisfied look at the unfin-
ished Memorial, as he passed, and then took his place on an
inverted wheelbarrow.
"Well 1" he said, rubbing his fins together complacently, "we 're
a getting on very nicely, eh r"
Tl I 'm sure I 'm very glad to hear it," said ALICE. "But what
isitP"
"Yes, what is your joke P" added the Gryphon. "What is the
fun of my sitting up there with a shield, staring at the back of St.
Clement's Danes, and obstructing the omnibuses?"
"Well now, I never!" said the Mansion House Turtle. "You'rea
grateful one. you are I Why, you 've never been on such a big 'orse
in your life before. There's the Queen and the Prince on the tier
below you; and the lot of you right in the middle of the road, where
everybody can't help running right agin you I Obstructing omni-
buses, indeed I Why, yer don't know what civic dignity means 1"
"I don't think they ought to stand in the middle of the road,"
said ALICE, plucking up courage as she gave a glance at the cumber-
some pile of scaffolding that blocked the already contracted thorough-
fare. "and I should pull all that thing down note—every stone'of it.
I call it stupid; and it is dreadfully in the way!"
"' Stoopid 1'" retorted the Mansion House Turtle, getting quite
green. "Why it cost twelve thousand pound I"
"Well, that'« stupid," said the Gryphon, " at all events!"
"You be quiet," continued the Mansion House Turtle, "and let
me explain. You don't understand. Talk of it being ' in the way,'
why. it will be a relief to the traffic."
"You mean a ba$ relief, I suppose ?" suggested A LICK; "and I 'm
sure it will all look very paltry in front of those big Law Courts."
"Paltry P" said the Mansion House Turtle. "Why, it's the very
thing. It will scale 'em!"
"Well, BIBCH scaled me," said the Gryphon, chuckling; "and I
wonder how ha looks now that job's done? It strikes me he had
muoh better have left me a block."
"Yes," said ALICE, reflecting, "I 've always heard that the blook
system was capital."
"Nothing to the block-head system," replied the Gryphon, giving
a look at the Mansion House Turtle. "And talking of,capital,
that '11 show you how to get through it!"
"You be quiet," said the Mansion House Turtle, angrily, "and
attend to your motter."
The Gryphon chuckled to himself, and looked up at his shield.
"By the bye," said ALICE, making out the Municipal legend
slowly. "that reminds me. What is JJomine dirige nog f"
".What the omnibuses will say when they come tilting on to me in
a fog," said the Gryphon. "Ton my word, it won't be safe! I
don't like it!"
"Then," said ALICE, with warmth, rising as she spoke, " I shall
certainly write to the Timet."
"And so shall I," said the Gryphon, "for I can tell my own tale.
Come along, let's master the subject."
It offered its arm to ALICE, and they walked slowly down the
Strand.
"Humph!" said the Mansion House Turtle, looking after them.
"To be master of the subject's one thing, but to be master of the situ-
ation 's another. Write your 'eads off if yon like, you won't stop me."
And the Mansion House Turtle waddled off towards the City for a
plate of his own soup.

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
WEVEB seed sich waist as or
the day after last Lord
Mare's Day, wen all the Reel
Turtel Soqp as was left from
the last night was aoshally
given to the Pore! Was ever
such rubbish heard on?
Reel Turtel Soop requires
the Stummiek of a Reel
Gentleman. Why, I re-
mimber when one Lord
Mare, SOT TOMMAS WITE 1
think it was, gave a dinner
to a lot of Sailers from the
Noarth Pole, and how did
they like the Turtel Soop?
Why they couldn't eat it?
One on 'em said to me " take
away this glue!" and ano-
ther of the common lot, took
the lovely Callepash for
Biled Snails! No, only reel
Gents and reel Waiters un-
derstans and injys Reel
Turtel.
HAVHTQ nothink to do last
Thursday BEOWN asked me
to go with him to see the
Common Counsel at Guildhall. So I went. And there I saw lots
of my nobel Paytrons, but lookin wery diffrint to what they do«s
when I waits on 'em of an evnin. The first think as struck me
was how much the Court was oranjed like their dinner tabels.
There was the Lord Mare in the chair, supported by the Alder-
men, not so many on 'em tho as of an evnin, and then came
the Ofisers in the best places as ushall, and then the Chairmen
of Committees and the Depittis, and then all the rest of the lot any-
wheres they could find a place. BBOWN tells me the Lord Mare is
so wery fond of the Aldermen, that he won't go on at all without
some on 'em, and if they leevs, he gits up and goes away. I think
the Depittis are about the finest lookin fellers there, I could pint
to several on 'em as fine sarmpels of rayther un-common Counsel
men. They looks as if they knew what a good glass of old Port wos,
and never reffoousd a sekkund. The differing Chairmen seem to do
almost all the torkin, and so they sets close to the Ripporterers, and
when one on 'em makes a little joke, he repeets it to the Ripporterers
when he sets down.
I sumtimes goes to the House of Commons perfeshnally, when
the Sheriffs goes there to ask for somethink, and gives some on 'em a
dinner. And after it's over I goes into the House and hears the
dibbaits, but. to my mind, there "s one or two Common Counselmen
beets 'em all oiler. Whether for action, or for noise, or for long
words, or for staggering sentences as almost makes your hair curl to
try and understand, they wins in a kanter. The funnyest part of
the thing is, that when one of their grand fellers says any of these
fine wunderful things, instead of all the others being struck with
haw, they bursts out into a rore of larfter.
Port-soken seems a nice genial name for a Ward. I wunder if I
could pick out the members by their Portsoken faces. If there ain't
above a dozen on 'em, I think I could. They all seems rather a noisy
lot, for they keeps a man a pirpus to nock on a book with a big
ammer, and call out " Order, Order!" and I 'm told they pays him
about £4 a week to do it. Ah! that must be a nice birth, that must.
I think it would just about soot my Son WILLIAM, that would. I
wonder what sort of health that ammarin Gent enjys, and wot his
rummidy is for a bad hed-ake. I ,wunder also weather he served
his Prenticeship to a Gold-beater, or weather it was under the
spreeddin Chesnut Tree where the Yillidge Smith he stands. Or
praps it were at Ammersmith.

To the Editor of Punch.
HONOURED SIB,
Which it is not often that I have the pleasure of agreeing
with Mr. HAKDMAN, the Beak, haying been too many times remanded
from Lambeth to the Surrey Sessions, to permit me to contemplate
him with any feelings except those or disdain and contempt, owing
to his habitually harsh treatment of me, and his cruel aspersions on
my character, and his more than once regretting in open court that
tie hadn't the power to order me a flogging. Ugh! And now the
other beaks want him to sit as a stipendiary, and not for the love
of making offensive remarks to an honest man. But honour
where honour is due, and often where it isn't, or there wouldn't be
some coves a-sitting on benches, and other coves a-standing in
locks; and Mr. HABDMAN'S suggestion that Horsemonger Lane Gaol
be turned into a recreation-ground, not so much meaning skittles as
innocent games, is worthy of all praise, and should be thought so by
all English folks. To think of that grimy old place—I've been
there, and it's beastly—a-turned into a play-ground, and all the
dear little kiddies yelling, and shouting, and swearing, and a-cheat-
ing each other at marbles, and whopping their little brothers and
sisters over the heads, well-nigh brings tears of joy into my eyes.
May Mr. HABDMAN and his good work prosper, which shows that I
bear no malice for past injustice and aspersions.
Which I hope, moreover, that the good work will not cease here.
3h, think of them poor little kids about Ludgate Hill, not far from
your office, Sir. with no place to play in. Cannot Mr. HABDMAN, or
some other good man, get that rotten old obstruction, called Newgate,
pulled down and turned into a recreation-ground'? Look at the
lundreds of squalid youngsters round and about Cold Bath Fields,
with no play-ground but the streets, and their healths being de-
stroyed, owing to the House of Correction not being pulled down
md turned into a garden. And how well a park would look on the
Thames Embankment, where that hideous Miilbank now stands.
May Heaven prosper Mr. HABDMAIT, may I subscribe my mite to
jarry out the good work; and may all prisons be turned into
Recreation Grounds is the wishes of

HOW TO RALLY HIM.
IF the British Tax-paver hesi-
tates for a moment to do some-
thing for Greece, why should not
Mr. RALLI ask him further to
reflect,—
That Thessaly and Epirus are
of no less importance to the
Empire than Margate and Rams-
gate.
That Greece still ia the cradle
of European figs.
That once upon a time AEIS-
ITDES was a real gentleman.
That England owes Greece a
terrible reparation for the Byron
Memorial.
That King GBOBGB is a very
sensible young man, indeed.
That just now, too, he has
40,000 troops on his hands, with
which he mutt do something.
That, under the circumstances,
a general European conflagration
wouldn't be half bad fun.
And that really, as the British

might, just for once, do the

another of an eminent literary swell.
Our Commissioner. Have you any trust funds?
Worshipful Master. Oh yes. A Mr. SMITH left us a little estate
in the City, some three hundred years ago, which produced £20
a-year, of which we were to pay £5 to the Church of St. Bennet-

by the pious founder.
Our Commissioner. You don't mean to say that out of £2000, you
distribute £15 in charily, and keep £1985 for yourselves P
Worshipful Master. Oh yes we do, in strict accordance with the
will of the pious founder.
Our Commissioner. Pious Fiddlesticks! Think you he could ever
have intended to give you £1985 for your trouble in distributing £15?
Worshipful Master. It is not for us to judge of the intentions of
so good a man; all I know is that we stick to his words. Will you
allow me to add, Sir, that we all think it very strange that we can't
be let alone. We are all satisfied, we don't complain, we are all
loyal and contented subjects, we loathe the very name of Reform,
we always drink Church andi QUEEN at our modest repasts, we are,
in fact, model Citizens. What more do you want P Do you want to
make us discontented like mere Irishmen?

Worshipful Master. Some few. of a most trivial character.
Our Commissioner. What do they amount to?
Worshipful Master. Not above a poor £500 a year.

nephew about £1000 a year; my son, the clerk, a poor £2000; my
two aunts about £100 a year; and my three nephews about £150.

WHERE ARE THE POLICE?
PEOPLE are constantly asking this question, and getting no satisfactory
answer. The following scrap of a diary from Scotland Yard, which has come
into our possession, may throw some bull's-eye light on the subject:—
(iuiet two days in the office, yesterday and to-day. All the Inspectors and
many of the Superintendents dancing attendance on the Licensing Magistrates
at Clerkenwell. Ought not, perhaps, to use the term "dancing attendance"
in such a C9nnection, because the Magistrates are rabid against dancing. Took
fifty intelligent officers from active service and put them on to Music-Hall
duty. Suspect they like it. Plenty of drink and plenty of loafing. Told them
to watch the behaviour of the hardened criminals who listen to songs and smoke
tobacco. Told them to report any songs that suggested impropriety. Said they
would to the best of their judgment, which is not much. Received a report
from one officer that a hornpipe nad been danced at one hall with only a music-
licence; also report from another officer that he thought a dramatic entertain-
ment was being given at another hall without a dramatic licence, but he would
like to go to the Dog-in-the-Manger Theatre, and see. Gave him a shilling and
a suit of plain clothes, and told mm to see. Reported himself at two o'clock
A.M., having just left the theatre. Said there had been a benefit and two Shak-
spearian plays— drinking going on all the time. This sounded very dreadful;
but found they had authority to sell drink as long as the performance lasted,
even during prohibited hours, under an Act of WILLIAM THE FOURTH.
Telegrams from outlying stations, saying that in consequence of the fogs,
the burglary season had commenced early with unusual severity. Took four
officers from Music-Hail duty, and put them on to Burglary. Fancy they
grumbled. Another officer reported improper singing at the ^Esthetic Music-
Hail. Made inquiry, and found the song was from the Cloches de Corneville,
and was being sung at the Chelsea Theatre. Sent to the Lord Chamberlain's
Office, next day, to know what it meant. Answer from Licenser of Plays that
he did not think the song improper, and answer from Licenser of Theatres that

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
The Diploma Gallery at the Royal Academy.
A SHOBT time since "A Musical Joke by MOZART," played at some
Promenade Concerts, attracted all London to hear it. The thousands
who delighted in the pleasantry, if they visited Burlington House
between the hours of ten and four, would find another tour deforce
of a similar character. All they would have to do would be to ask
their way to the Diploma Gallery. "When found, they might make
a note of" what may be aptlytermed a "piece of pictorial waggery."
On the occasion of my visit I was kindly attended (" in my mind's
eye, Horatio "} by the spectral figure of a typical Royal Academician,
who was good enough to act as a guide.
"We have managed to hide the directing placard behind a pillar,"
chuckled this amusing personage, as I ascended some stone steps.
"When the Public can't find it, they do grow so wild!"
Smiling good-naturedly at the joke, I pushed open a door, and
found myself in a dimly-lighted passage leading to a dark staircase.
"You will have to go to the very top before you come to our little
comicalities," was the spectral commentary. It was true enough.
I laboured up and up until, out of breath, I reached a landing, upon
•which was placed a plaster-cast which I pretended to examine with
the greatest curiosity.
"What a humbug you are!" was whispered in my ear. "You
know you can't see it! Do you think we should have put it there if
we had believed for a moment that you could '< Excelsior! Plenty
more steps before you come to us!"
Again I laboured on, and found another plaster-cast, which I
learnt was the same as the first—Cupid and Psyche, by GIBSON.
"Funny notion that, eh?" I heard. "Pity we hadn't more of
them! But as we had only two, we put both of them in corners,
close together, iu the dark! Come, you must smile at that piece of
drollery!"
I stumbled on, and encountered more plaster-casts. So far as I
could make out, they appeared to be busts of nobody in particular,
grouped round the model of a horse that would have been the very
thing for a sign outside a farrier's shop.
_ » /"•%-». Another effort and I was in the Gallery.
l'>'^'3iv3JT' •S*' There were three rooms. On my left,
?#3t=2t:*fed^E,l x amongst some statues, sat the genius of
the place. He wore a cap drawn down
close over his ears, a horse-cloth thrown
over his shoulders, and a blanket tucked
comfortably round his legs. He was seated
on a chair, reading a daily paper, and
seemed to be suffering greatly from the
draught. Beside him (under a towel) was
a suit of livery, apparently ready te be
assumed at a moment's notice, on the
approach of Royalty or other visitors of distinction. He looked at
me as I entered, as if he were unaccustomed to the presence of
strangers, and then resumed his reading.
"You can see. from the unconventional costume of our custodian,
that the Public do not patronise us as they ought to do," grumbled
my Spectre-guide. "In fact, our janitor has the place very much to
himself. He must know all our little jokes by heart. I verily
believe that even the ' Battle of Chillianwallah,' at the end of the
Gallery, by this time has ceased to move him to uproarious merri-
ment!
Leaving the official in undress behind me, I walked quickly into
the last room. It contained an enormous Cartoon of BLUCHEH
meeting WELLINGTON after Waterloo, hung in such a manner as to
bring out in full relief the rich absurdities of Mr. JONES'S martial
masterpiece. A strange mixture of dying Guardsmen, military
sycophants, and Generals prancing unconcernedly amongst the
wounded, formed a striking contrast to a small and compact set
piece that in the palmy days of ASTLEY'S Amphitheatre would have
been undoubtedly "billed" as "Exciting Combats, one hundred
trained Auxiliaries, concluding with a grand display of Fireworks,
and the triumphant Victory of the gallant British Arms—for this
night only!" i'he two battle-pieces were toned down with a myste-
rious piece of stonework labelled "Antique Fragment of a Female
Draped Figure." Further on was an arm-chair under a glass-case,
that seemed to be proud of its anonymity.
"We don't tell them what it is, or to whom it belonged, or how it
came here," explained the Spectre. "We do so like to puzzle
them!"
I now entered the Centre Room. On one side were the efforts of
past Academicians—on the other the works of more modern Masters.
I selected the latter for examination. The study of a gigantic hand
first attracted my attention. It was worked out in great detail in
shadow on the wall in conjunction with the reflection of a nose which
had been introduced most successfully to heighten the effect. The
hand belonged to Mr. COPE, but I could not discover the proprietor of
the nose. Not far from this quaint fancy was a merry family party
vol. uxrz. j



engaged, apparently, in a game of romps. The son had put his
head on the table ready to cry forfeits; one of his sisters, evidently
preferring blindman's-buff, had covered
her eyes with an apron; while a
second damsel whispered into the ear
of the good old mother one of a series
of "cross questions and crooked
answers" destined presently to set the
table in a roar. In the meanwhile the
genial old father politely requested a
young lady carrying a doll to with-
draw into the garden for a few
minutes, while he prepared to surprise
her with a little " dumb crambo." I
was heartily admiring this pleasant
picture of " Christmas Time at Holly-
bush Farm," when I was surprised
to notice the composition labelled, for
some unaccountable reason, "The
Outcast."
And now I came to a characteristic
work by that greatest of artists, Mr. SOLOMON HART. It was called
An Early Reading of Shakspeare," and was chiefly remarkable
for the Reader's legs, which were of abnormal proportions. Leaving
a waxwork group of "St. Gregory teaching his Chant" for the
consideration of some unam-
bitious imitator of Madame
TUSSATJD, I came to a pic-
torial protest against the
views favoured by Sir WIL-
FKID LAWSON. A lady (whose
recent occupation was deli-
cately hinted at in the tones
of her nose) was rising from
a wine-cellar, to kiss a semi-
intoxicated lover in the pre-
sence of a decidedly " drunk
and incapable" Father.
Turning from this " Scene from the Two Gentlemen of Verona" (as
the painful tableau was called), 1 gazed at an enormous picture of a
salmon, a few mountains, a couple of boats, and a study of wide-
awakes. This vast composition turned out to be " Letters and News
at the Loch tide." The central fish was interesting, but I cannot
conscientiously say that I admired the accessories.
I next noticed a picture of Mr. FKITH (dressed for a lounge in the
Park) busily engaged in sketching a sleeping crossing-sweeper.
Charmed with this study of real life, I turned to something more
artificial. In a " Pleasant Corner" I found a wax doll in a ten-
and-sixpenny doll's house. Then came an old favourite. "Whither"
introducing me once again to a portly mediseval Paterfamilias taking
a walk in his garden after his dinner. He was still accompanied by
his daughter carrying a tin of biscuits. I could hear the girl murmur,
as of old, "I do so wish Papa would return to the house for his
coffee, as he will wear his slippers I" Then Mr. HOOK showed me an
incident in country life. A man was meeting a woman and a child
in a lane, and exclaiming, on noticing that they both were wearing
"big heads," " What, Boxing Day already!" Lastly, I stumbled
upon a strange-looking person, biting his nails among some moun-
tainous sponge-cakes, while a lion in the back-ground leisurely
devoured a baby hippopotamus. I frankly admit I was perplexed
to make head or tail of it.
"I knew you would never guess it I" exclaimed my spectral
Friend, who had been silent for some time. "But look at the label,
and you will be enlightened."
I obeyed the direction, and read, to my extreme astonishment, the
simple word " Remorse." This last mystery unnerved me. I deter-
mined to fly before my confusion was completed.
"But you have not seen half the good things!" exclaimed my
shadowy Guide. "The old pictures are just as funny as the new;
and there is really a world of quiet humour in the arrangement of
the back hair of a lion belonging to St. Jerome. It has been imitated
in the toy-shops, but"
I angrily interrupted, and refused to go further.
"But pray be reasonable," continued the well-meaning Phantom.
"You cannot imagine what an absurd effect we obtain by mixing up
the Gibson Gallery with the daubs of a century. You cannot
think"
But by this time I had escaped, and was once more in Piccadilly.
As I hurriedly walked away, an old lady stopped me, and asked me
where she could find the Chamber of Horrors?
In the right-hand corner of Burlington House," I replied, anl
although I answered at random, I believe I spoke truthfully.
A " SCBEW" OF TOBACCO.—The man who grudges you a cigar.

HOW AND WHY IT WAS DONE!

THE trembling Grand Vizier,"calledjup in the dead^of night,
hastened to the sanctum of his Sovereign.
"0 Sultan of Sultans!" sobbed the unlucky Minister, prostrating
himself before the Imperial couch. "The meanest of thy slaves
hopes to escape the bowstring! "What has he done that his loved
Master should frown upon him?"
"Rise, Grand Vizier, and be not a fool," said the Monarch gra-
ciously. "I want thy brains, and not thy head. Quick—pens, ink,
and paper."
In a moment the now reassured official was seated on the floor in
an attitude of rapt attention.
The SULTAN drew from his breast a paper, kissed it, and then
returned it to its resting-place. Then he commenced in an excited
voice—
"Know, 0 pig! that I am about to put my financial affairs in
business-like order I"
_The Grand Vizier shook his head in a melancholy fashion, but held
his peace. He had heard something of the sort frequently before.
"I will do my duty!" cried the SULTAN, enthusiastically. "I will
pay my debts! And, as a first step towards this end, invite the cursed
European Dogs—I should say the Turkish Bond-holders—to send
delegates to Constantinople to enter into direct communication with
the Ottoman Government."
"_ As there are ten categories of Bond-holders of different nation-
alities, all with more or less conflicting claims, will not this be a
difficult task, 0 Defender of the Faithful ?" was the Grand Vizier's
feeble suggestion.
"DogI Degraded dog!" shouted the angry Monarch, hurling
his slipper at his offending Minister. "That is their business, and
not mine I Say another word and thou shalt spend the remainder of
thy miserable life in company with the fishes of the Bosphorus!"
The wounded official, hearing this, kept a discreet silence, and
waited for further instructions.
"Tell them," dictated the SULTAN, "that I propose recommencing
payment of the interest on their bonds by a simple expedient. I
invite them to appoint a Banker who shall have the honour of incur-
ring a fresh debt of eight millions sterling—on their behalf—in their
name!" The Grand Vizier did not raise his eyes from his writing.
"Add that of course they must look after the floating debt and
arrange about the Russian Indemnity. But when this is done—mark
my words—tchen this is done they shall have, subject, of course, to
my general supervision, all the remainder.'" And the SULTAH'S
face beamed again with an expression of gratified generosity.
"What remainder?" asked the Grand Vizier unconsciously.
"Pig! Paltry pig!" shouted the angry Monarch, throwing his
second slipper at the head of his Minister. "Dost thou dare to laugh
at my beard? I haven't got a beard—but no matter. 'What re-
mainder!' That is their business, and not mine 1 Away, dolt! And
if the Circular is not to my liking, beware of the torture-chamber!"
Within a couple of hours the Grand Vizier once more presented
himself before his master. Grovelling in the dust, he handed his
Sovereign a despatch.
"Very fair, indeed!" murmured the SULTAN as he perused the
Circular. "And I have news to tell thee. HOB ART PACHA has
suggested a new impost."
"Indeed, my Lord I I thought every source of income was ex-
hausted."
"Faith, and so did I," answered the Padishah, relapsing for a
moment into his ancient language. "But, bedad, the Admiral's
found another! He suggests an elegant tax upon Ambassadors!
And now away to the Printers, the Pressmen, and the Tele-
graphers!"

But the Minister lingered. At last he ventured to say,
"0 Defender of the Faithful, deign to enlighten the
meanest of thy slaves! Why dost then issue this Cir-
cular?"
"Because I wish to obtain the sympathy of Europe,
whatever happens," was the immediate answer.
1 But how. 0 Lord of Lords f—how P"
"How! By paying one per cent, upon my Bonds,
stupid!"
"Ah! To he sure! Just so! And what caused
thee, 0 Sire, to think of such a clever thing?" con-
tinued the obsequious official, impelled by a feeling of
overpowering curiosity.
"This admirable picture!" cried the SULTAN, again
pulling the paper from his breast, and kissing it fer-
vently. "Down on thy knees, dog, and worship it!"
The Grand Vizier obeyed, and paid respectful homage
to Mr. Punch's Cartoon entitled "Argwnentum ad
Pocketum," and bearing date Oct. 9.
THE CITY OF UNMITIGATED POT-HOUSES.
To the (Seldom-at-} Home Secretary.
Sra,—If it is possible for any Minister to spare time
from clumsy attempts to regulate the Universe, and to
learn that one parochial gutter well swept is worth a
hundred foreign dependencies over-governed into mad-
ness, it certainly would be advisable for that Minister
to grapple with our Licensing Chaos. The worship of
the Sacred Jackass is carried a little too far when this
Chaos is dignified with the name of System. Four mil-
lions of wretched rate- and tax-payers, doomed to live in
the most dismal City of Unmitigated Pot-houses on the
face of the earth, are bound over, hand and foot, as far as
their amusements are concerned, to an irresponsible Court
Official and six hundred of the most ignorant, preju-
diced—possibly venal, and certainly narrow-minded—
creatures that a Lord-Lieutenant caa pick out from the
dreary ranks of respectability. This unwieldy assembly,
with the exception of the Court Official, is set in motion
by a brutal Act of Parliament that is a notorious disgrace
to a not over-creditable Statute-Book. Originally framed
to stop the singing of Jacobite songs, which the Dutch
monarch of the period feared, but could neither read,
sing, nor understand, and ostensibly directed in the
coarsest terms against the "social evils" of 1750, this
precious sample of antique legislation has descended to
1880, and administered as it is by a body only worthy of
such an Act, it now paralyses the amusements of four
millions of Londoners. Once during its long existence it
has been amended or tinkered, but in a way that reflects
the utmost discredit on its timid tinkers. When it was
discovered, about three or four years ago, that, under its
heaven-born provisions, a few harmless old women sitting
at a concert before rive o'clock in the afternoon were com-
mitting an indictable offence, it was thought by those
who knew little of the cowardice of weak-kneed Govern-
ments, that the days of this triumph of legislative wisdom
were certainly numbered. They were thoroughly mis-
taken. The ulcer was simply cut out, when the body
ought to have been strangled; and the 25 Geo. II., cap. 36,
still remains to comfort the true worshippers of the Sacred
Jackass.
Amongst the countless pot-houses in this City of Pot-
houses, there are about four hundred that hold a music
licence, and perhaps about twenty that hold a music and
dancing licence. The owners of these houses go to one
licensing authority for tobacco, to another for beer, and
to another for the licence to sell wines and spirits. Thanks
to the Omnipotence of Gin and Beer in the councils of
the nation, they have little difficulty in obtaining the
drink licences if they stand well with the two great
drink-producing interests.
Of course the usual hypocrisy is shown in all public
debates on this question. Every Member—Minister or
no Minister—carefully ignores the fact that one-third of
our enormous national expenditure is drawn from national
drunkenness; and the unfortunate publicans are snubbed
and lectured, as if they were criminals, instead of active
feeders of the Revenue. Any attempt to temper Gin
and Beer with Music and Dancing is resisted by the
compact Mawworm class, who rule the Licensing Sessions.
Ten thousand applications for Music and Dancing would
be made to-morrow, if there were anything like freedom
and wisdom in our Licensing Chaos. London would

become as sober and cheerful as Paris or Vienna. The sot would become a
singer, the wife-kicker a dancer; and what would be lost in one way by the
Exchequer, would be gained in another. The million or more sterling now
invested in London Music-halls would be exposed to competition; but, on the
other hand, the owners of this property would feel an unwonted security in
their investments.
We mention these " vested interests," because we know the weakness and the
composition of Governments; but there is a broader ground on which to argue
this question— that of public convenience. The four millions of people in this
City of Unmitigated Pot-houses have a right to demand as many music and
dancing- rooms as they think they require; and the supply, we presume, as
usual, will follow the demand. If any one of these rooms is mismanaged, that
may be a reason for punishing the proprietor; but it is no reason for closing
the rooms, any more than the adulteration of bread would be a reason for the
closing of a bakery. An ignorant and underpaid Policeman is not the proper
person to judge and report upon the management of public amusements, any
more than a sour body of unpaid Puritans— six hundred in number — is a fitting
body to license these amusements. If all the Conventicles of London were put
under the direction of six hundred Comic Singers, divided into a dozen or more
conflicting jurisdictions, it is possible that even the Meddlevex Magistrates, and
the worshippers of the Sacred Jackass would he converted to something like
reason and justice. PracH AJfj Jtmius.

1 KLI1V
THE O'DOWD AT THE O'DOLPHI.
"OLD Materials made up. Jobs neatly executed. Orders punc-
tually attended to "—not after seven. New card for the O'Dramatist.
This is the story of the O'Dowo :—
MIKE O'Dowo, son of an Irish fish salesman,
having received a liberal education and graduated
at Trinity College, Dublin, comes up to London,
takes a liking to the name of Walsingham, and
under the mistaken notion that a Walsingham
has a chance in London where an O'Dowa has
none (an error which might easily have been cor-
rected by the enterprising youth running his eye
over the list of names at the Government Offices
in Whitaker't Almanack—vide Judge-Advocate
General's department), he drops his Irish name,
comes out as a Walsingham—a great acquisition
at dances where active young men are in great
request by the ladies for waltzing 'em—and being
an uncommonly sharp chap, he so completely mas-
ters the English tongue that by the.time the piece
begins there isn't the slightest flavour of the Irish
brogue left in him. As he has been born and
bred in Ireland, this victory over the brogue is
itself a marvel, and quite prepares us to expect
great things from the talented young gentleman, gallantly represented
by Mr. HEWKT NBVILLE, who has been able to accomplish so much in
so short a time.
His next happy thought is the humorous notion of borrowing
money on this capital name of Walsingham—Walsingham having
now become his stock-in-trade. This practical joke he carries to the
extent of £20,000, foolishly supplied to him by
one Mr. Ramsey Leake—capitally played by
Mr. J. G. TAYLOR—on very insufficient security.
The conduct of the fish-salesman's son is cha-
racteristic of his origin. "Fishy is the word,"
as Mr. PATEMAS—who does a great deal with
the character of Chalker, the man in possession
—would say. Ramsey Leake finding out that
MIKE'S father is worth £20,000, comes down on
him to pay his son's debts, and save him from
disgrace. But from what disgrace is the ques-
tion P His son's friends by this time know all
about him, and have condoned the offence.
Even the wealthy widow to whom he was pay-
ing his addresses—the only thing apparently
that he ever did pay—has forgiven mm, and
all his old associates have been backing him,
as O'Dowd, in his canvass for his native
borough, which it is his ambition to represent in Parliament.
Perhaps in the face of a future Election Commission there might
have been some difficulty as to advancing such a large sum for
election expenses; but as he has gained the day before the appear-
ance of his creditor, the £20,000 would never have come under the
head of Bribery and Corruption. Had this idea occurred to any one
of them, of course the play would have been brought to a sudden
termination in the Third Act; indeed, it need not have gone beyond
the Second; and Mr. BOTJCICATTLT would not have had an opportunity
of reminding us of Mr. SHEIL
BARKY in Let Cloches de Corne-
ville, on whom the loss of his
hoarded money has the same
effect as the discovery of his
son's swindling has on Daddy
O'Dotcd.
In the last Act kind old Daddy
recovers his senses, in accord-
ance with the stereotyped stage
plan of "clock strikes—he re-
members to _have heard a clock
strike in his early childhood,
bursts into tears," and his rea-
son returns. Instead of the clock,
it is the recurrence of a situa-
tion similar to one of which he and his son Mike had been the
heroes a long time ago. History repeats itself; and dramatic authors
and actors repeat themselves and other people too with more or
lees success.
Well—that's all. Few people are interested in Walsingham alias
O'Doted; and all are disappointed at Mr. BOUCICAULT'S not being
a rollicking, careless, Irish peasant throughout, the hero of a sensa-
tional drama. The piece is admirably put on to the stage. Mr.
FREW'S .Barney Toole is an excellent sketch; and Mr. E. COMPION,
reminding us forcibly of his father's manner, plays the difficult part
of a young swell who in the first Act has to gush considerably, in a

thoroughly natural and unaffected manner. He has all the makings
of a genuine light comedian. Mr. J. COOPER plays Wilcox, Lady
Rose Lawletft butler, so well in the Second Act,
that we were not at all surprised when, on Lady
Rose going to Ireland, we saw him promoted to
be the Sheriff of Bally-na-Cuish, and conducting the
proceedings with the utmost courtesy and impar-
tiality. He did not seem to be recognised by his
former employer, nor by any of her guests in whom
he had previously been in constant attendance;
but this might be chiefly swing to his having
adopted a new wig, and his having picked np the
Irish brogue with as great facility as Mike O'Doted
had dropped it. Bridget CfDoicd (Miss LE THIERK)
is about as useful and ornamental as the unfor-
tunate widow who was the cause of the recent
Merivale and Ward litigation. Mr. H. PROCTOH
is suited in'Colonel Muldoon, and Miss LTDIA FOOTK,
as Kitty M'Coul. looks less "my cool" than "my
comfortable." Why does she go about London
without a bonnet? Only orange-women and flower-
girls do this in town; and surely Daddy O'Doicd*t
niece wouldn't have come all the way from Ireland
like that? If Mr. BOUCICAULT knows she did, of
course that's sufficient; but though a first-rate
stage-manager, he doesn't know everything, or he
would never have permitted the sudden appearance of /,•.•.-/-•/ Rote
Lawless's gorgeous powdered
footmen, in moustaches, to appear
for no earthly reason whatever at
the finish of the Second Act, just
to distract the attention of the
audience and spoil the tableau.
If they won't shave, and if they
must come on because they 've
got the liveries, then let Lady
Rose explain their moustaches
as a little eccentric fancy of her
own. Miss PATEMAN plays Lady
Rose very cleverly. But then
she is very clever in everything,
specially when it doesn't suit
her in the least (like this part),
and then she triumphs.
We stayed to welcome Mrs. MELLON in the after-piece, and wished
there had been something for her in the drama.
The capital little troupe at
St. George's Hall are always
welcome company. There is
not the slightest danger in
trusting toA. HEED in Langham
Place, and the COBNF.Y GHAUT
planted in the same locality in-
variably yields a crop of plea-
sant chaff. To suit the clerical
element in the audience, the
management have wisely pro-
vided themselves with A
Bishop, and have engaged Miss
HtTDSPEin (Mrs. PHEI.PS), who
developes (or as a reckless pun-
ster might say, de-phel'ps) con-
siderable talent. The Haunted
Room, the latest addition to Mr. GRAIN'S repertoireoi musical sketches,
is as good as any of its predecessors—which
is saying a great deal. The clever mimicry
of the Village Choir is full of local colouring;
and the imitation of the various clocks, inclu-
sive of the short, sharp American timepiece,
is something to laugh over and remember.
The present "First Part" of the Entertain-
ment is illustrated with extremely pretty
music by Mr. LIONEL BENSON, and is capitally
acted all round. Mr. ALFKED RRED in the
Second Part is seen to great advantage (in
more senses than one) as the '' Fat Boy" out
of "Pickwick" into a Public School. Nothing
could be better than his assumption of boyish

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVAKI.

TO A MODERN PYRRHA.
On, PYRBHA, say what
Youth, so wan and
worn,
Wool thee with many a
whisper heard at e'en?
For whom do you so curi-
ously adorn—
A subtle symphony in
sad sage-green?
How oft will he your way-
wardness deplore,
And miss the smiles that
once were all for him;
When this aesthetic mania
is o'er,
And you 're perchance
engrossed in some new
whim I
But 'as for me, my first
love is the last;
New fancies and new
faces charm no more;
And, even were my youth-
ful days not past,
You 're not the sort of
girl I should adore.
For whom do you, so very tightly laced.
With well-furred shoulders promenade the street?
Your hat a Gainsborough Beauty might have graced,
A Chinese lady envied those small feet.
What youth admires that figure BO pinched in?
Who loves the fashions as they are just now?
What wonder that you grow so pale and thin,
With interesting furrows on your brow.
When to your natural grace will you give play?
'Tis better thus than crinoline and hoop.
"She stoops to conquer." Pretty PrBKHA, say
Now, if you want to conquer, can you stoop'?
THE ELECTION COMMISSIONS.
WE have every reason to believe that the following are truthful
summaries of the Election Hi-ports which will be presented to Parlia-
ment by the Commissions.
IMMACULATESFIELD.
It is impossible for us conscientiously to report that we are satis-
fied with the manner in which the Election here was conducted. . . .
The facts about the "mysterious stranger" are very suspicious. If
he was not a bribing agent, why did he perambulate the chief tho-
roughfares with a bag of gold at his side, requesting the electors to
vote for Captain COFFEHFDXL, the "Blue" Candidate? Why, if
they promised to vote for Captain COFFERFTTLL, did he employ them
as messenger at a salary varying from £1 to £10 an hour? These
facts, we repeat, appear suspicious. It is, perhaps, open to remark
that this "mysterious stranger" has not appeared to give evidence
before us, and both sides profess complete ignorance of who he is,
where he is; or, in fact, whether he isjat all. Perhaps he's indis-
posed, and has not heard of this inquiry as yet. ... As to TOM
SNOOKS, we are not satisfied that he actually received more than £20
for his vote, though the manner in which he gave his evidence was
most satisfactory. We are rather inclined to believe that the valu-
able gold watch which TOM SNOOKS presented to his sweetheart the
day after the polling, was purchased out of some money which he
received as an equivalent for his vote—or, as he facetiously expresses
it, for "his loss of time." It is only fair to add that TOM SNOOKS
himself swears that this is not the case, but that the watch was
bought with money saved out of his earnings during the last two
years. As TOM SSOOKS has only been in employment (as a rag-and-
bone-picker) for one year, and his weekly wage is about five shillings,
his story appears to us to bear on it traces of inaccuracy. Still, we
are unwilling to believe that this excellent fellow has been commit-
ting wilful and corrupt perjury. , . . However, there can hardly be
any doubt that some money was spent in illegal practices in this
borough, inasmuch as we find that the number of the electors is 150
all told, and that £3000 was contributed by each Candidate for
Election expenses, while another £3000 was contributed by political
friends. Both Candidates assure us they had no notion that the
money would or could possibly be spent in bribery or treating. They
appear nice gentlemanly fellows, but it is odd that they had no sus-
S'cions as to the use that was being made of their cheque-books.
i. TIMOTHY HIQGINS acknowledged that he had received £10 for
running messages, another £10 to see that the other messengers ran
messages, besides £20 to see that no bribing went on, and an addi-
tional douceur of £30 to be sure that there was no treating. This
looks to us like corruption, though we don't feel quite sure about it.
Other cases of a similar nature occurred, so we can only end by
recommending this ancient and most respectable borough, to the
mercy of your honourable House.
HAM SANDWICH ASD VEAL.
This dirty and decayed little towi, or two towns, appears, to our
unanimous judgment, to be the most corrupt borough in the United
Kingdom. At least, we cannot possibly imagine any borough more
corrupt. There are upon the Register 500 burgesses, and of these
we have to report that 495 were either directly or indirectly bribed.
Of the remaining five, one is a hopeless idiot, or has the reputation
of being so. Possibly this reputation 'may arise from the fact,
credibly reported to us as true, that on the occasion of a former
election this deluded individual refused £5 and a glass of beer for
his vote, on so-called " conscientious" grounds. If so, we are per-
fectly certain that there is no other man, woman, or child in Ham
Sandwich and Veal that feels any such ridiculous scruples
The four other persons who were not proved to have been bribed, can
be easily accounted for. One refused to receive £10 for his vote,
considering the sum offered much too small, and so didn't vote at all.
Another had every intention of taking £5 from each side, but unfor-
tunately couldn't find the place of distribution, and had to go with-
out. The two others left the town hurriedly on the day that the
Commission arrived at it, and are not expected to return until the
Commission has finished its labours. This satisfactorily accounts for
the whole population, so we can finish off this report here; and jolly
glad we are to be done with it. We cannot, however, close witiout
recording a mnst excellent JOKE made by one of our number, which
we feel sure will amuse your honourable House. On Mr. SMITHKIN'S
remarking that " he had been promised £10 to vote blue, but had
not yet received it," Mr. (rising) JETJNIOB replied, "Then I suppose
you are all in the bluet?" This appears to us a witticism so con-
summate in itself, and so admirably suited to the character of the
occasion and the dignity of the inquiry, that we should fail in our
duty if we omitted to record it. And your Commissioners will ever
pray, &c.
OiBOfiouoir.
This place is a Cathedral town. Therefore we need hardly say it
is corrupt. Cathedral towns always are corrupt. There is some-
thing in a Gothic pillar, or a Norman arch, which irresistibly leads
to depravity; and an Early English spire seems to be a direct
incentive to vice (not the " vice," of course).
It is very pleasing among the dark aspects of electoral affairs, to
notice one feature of these elections, which seems to point to better
times coming. As everybody knows, there is an ancient University
here; and, of course, the University has nothing whatever to do
with the City Election. Yet, notwithstanding this, there are great
and good men among the professors and lecturers, who go out of
their way to discharge their duty to their country, actually con-
tributing as much as £50 a head to the expenses (of course the
necessary expenses) of the Election; and when that is not sufficient,
running up to town, and getting as much as £3000 from the Head
Centre of their respective parties to expend in—well, necessary
expenses—as we said before. This patriotic devotion to their duty
as citizens cannot be too highly commended.
Various sad cases of bribery Tiave come before us, also of treating;
but the gloom of our proceedings has been uniformly enlightened
by comic incidents. Thus, Mr. JEEEMT SPASKS, who confessed to
having received £15 for purposes of treating, expended £3 in treat-
ing others, and £12 in treating himself. When asked if he con-
sidered such treatment of the funds honest, he replied, " Oh, yes,
quite," which, we need hardly say, convulsed the Court and the
audience with laughter, as was only natural.
The " lay clerk of St. John's College" (we are not quite sure what
a " lay clerk" is, but fancy it's some inferior kind of election agent)
who gave evidence as to his having paid £10 to one man because " he
was handy with his fists," appears to us to have somewhat exceeded
his duties as a " lay clerk." Another of the agents, who must be a
wag in his way, described himself as '' Chichele Professor of Modern
History," a harmless pleasantry which must have rather tickled
that venerable University official when he heard of it.
We really can't find anything more that's likely to interest your
honourable House, and we beg to recommend either that the place
be disfranchised—which seems rather severe^-or that the Cathedral,
as the great centre of corruption, be immediately de»troyed—which
appears to us a more statesmanlike plan. It's not much of a cathe-
dral, and wouldn't be missed, except by the Dean and the aged
woman who sweeps it out once a week.

"AND now we '11 lave you," said the O'CATESBY, drawing his cloak tightly about him,
the other conspirators at the same time following his example. "Shure an' it's a snug place
you've got here intoirely," he added as, casting a glance at the accumulated storage oi
combustible and explosive material, that reached now nearly to the roof of the cellar, he
gave a familiar nod to the arch plotter who had undertaken to fire it.
"All right, me hoy!" replied the latter, giving a wink at his lantern and matches as he
:ook his seat on a barrel full of back num-
bers of the JYation. "It's loikely ye '11 be
bearing a thrifle from me before long. But,
whisht! — whisht I" he added, as if an
after-thought seemed to strike him —
"Moighty convanient as is the tiniment.
I thrust now it's no rint that ye've paid
for it!"
"Hint! Begorra! Hooroosh !—divil a
bapenny!" was the earnest reply. The
cloaked figures gave a wild whoop of satis-
faction, and cut a peculiar caper. Then,
as if the information had reassured them,
they stealthily withdrew. The door closed
nui.-elessly on the last. Misther O'Ocr
FATVKES was alone.
It was a dark and disagreeable hole, this
subterranean vault in which treason had
lumtily collected the evidences of its own
stupid project. Nor did the latter add to
its attractiveness. Barrels on barrels of
vulgar rhodomontade,—of passionate incite-
ment to outrage and rebellion, strewn over,
here and there, with a few scanty faggots
of free speech,—destined, but ineffectually,
to conceal the mischief beneath,—cumbered
the ground and half concealed the walls of
the vaulted retreat. Placed as this was
under the fabric of law and order, the con-
spirators hoped that an explosion would
not only paralyse the executive but shatter
the Union. Reflecting complacently on this
situation of affairs, Misther O'GuY FAWKKS
waited the approach of the appointed hour.
But something had happened on which
the conspirators had not counted. The
Irish Secretary had received an anonymous
warning.. Some friend, anxious for his re-
putation, had decided, at all hazards, to
give him an inkling of the true state of
affairs. Thus it was that he had received
suddenly one morning by post a copy of the
Times. The incident was mysterious. He
had been conceiving for some weeks past a
growing distaste for the national stew, and
was in a condition to be easily unsettled.
He was upset. Nor was this all. His
return ticket, good only for a month, was
nearly up; while he had heard that a new
Hibernian piece of an exciting character
had been produced at the Adelphi. This
determined him. He resolved on action.
And now the fifth of November was at hand.
Silent amidst his inflammable parapher-
nalia, our hero waited its approach., uncon-
scious of coming surprise. But, as he waited,
the officers of justice were even now upon
him. There was a stir in the vault.
"Sure an I heard something," said
Misther O'GuY FAWKES, peering inquisi-
tively through the shadowy gloom. '' Bedad,
if it's any gintlemen that s afther the boys
now,—we 'fl jist all of us have a taste o' tne
blow up together!"
He turned cautiously. He was not mis-
taken. There were misty figures advancing
towards him. His first impulse was to
consult a solicitor. Then he thought of the
barrels. But he was too late. In a minute
more he was seized by a powerful arm and
called upon in the Queen's name to sur-
render.

The Right Hon. the Lord Mayor.
Commissioner. You are, I believe, Lord Mayor of London P
Lord Mayor. I am.
Commissioner. From what do you derive your title of Right Honourable?
Lord Mayor. I am a Privy Councillor.
Commissioner. When did you last attend a Privy Council P
Lord Mayor. I have not attended at all. Nothing of sufficient importance
has happened to require my presence.
Commissioner. When was the last time a Lord Mayor attended a Privy
Council Y
Lord Mayor. In 1837, when his Most Gracious and Religious Majesty
WILLIAM THE FOURTH joined his Illustrious Ancestors.
Commissioner. What are your principal duties P
Lord Mayor. They are almost too numerous to detail, but I will refer to a
few. I have to sign my name thirty thousand times officially. I have to dine
five thousand hungry people in the most splendid manner human ingenuity can
devise. I have to preside at fifty public dinners, and persuade fifty different
sets of people to cash up handsomely for fifty different charities; and, far, far
beyond all as a test of human endurance, I have to listen to fifty Charity Sermons,
without the possibility of one quiet nap, as I feel that every eye is upon me.
Commissioner. Terrible, indeed! Anything further?
Lord Mayor. Oh yes, lots I I have to preside at all the Meetings of those
slowest of slow coaches the Aldermen, and at every Court of that wild democracy,
the Common Council. I have to entertain Royal or Illustrious Foreign Visitors,
if occasion offer, taking, so to speak, the place of Majesty, during Majesty's
temporary eclipse. I have to attend West-End Receptions, Garden Parties,
State Balls, and Concerts, and bear myself as if to the manner born.
I have to administer justice indifferently—that is, in
accordance with the advice of my learned Clerk.
I have to speak upon Art to R.A.'s, and to dilate upon
the Drama to Critics and Actors, to entertain Princes,
Ministers, Ambassadors, and all the Lords of the Council,
and trust they may have grace, wisdom, and un-
derstanding.
I have to rush about the country—here, there, and
everywhere—to (five eclat, by the pomp and circumstances
of my surroundings, to any local object I consider of
sufficient importance.
I have to conduct myself on all occasions as the repre-
sentative of a long and distinguished line of predecessors,
beginning with ALAVYN, who governed London in the
twelfth century, and including such names as WHITTING-
TON and GEKSHAM, and to feel that in every circumstance
of my important position the eyes of Europe are upon me.
Commissioner. Bless my soul, my Lord, you almost
take away my breath. And what may be the salary
awarded to your Lordship for all this tremendous lot of
work?
Lord Mayor. Ten thousand pounds.
Commissioner. May I ask, in the most delicate way, if
it is generally found sufficient?
Lord Mayor. I cannot answer for others, but I should
think, for my part, it would require about three times
that amount.
Commissioner. Dear me! And are there no perquisites
or other matters that would repay this vast expenditure?
Lord Mayor. None whatever, except the approbation of
my fellow-citizens, and occasionally the approval of our
Gracious Sovereign.
Commissioner. You describe, my Lord, an amount of
useful and important work, that I confess surprises me.
Lord Mayor. I do not wish to weary you; but I may
add that I am the Almoner, as it were, of the Charity of
the whole Metropolis, and sometimes of the whole
country, for the alleviation of any great calamity, foreign
or domestic.
Commissioner. Just so. But the one idea that strikes
me is, could not all this be done without so much of the
tinsel, and glitter, and barbaric splendour, so to speak,
that Eeems somewhat out of place in these matter-of-
fact days?
Lord Mayor. That is a question to which I feel
scarcely competent to give an unbiassed answer; but,
if we are to emulate the Republican simplicity of our
American Cousins ia all ceremonial matters, why begin
with the Corporation, where it certainly won t end?
Commissioner. I see the significance of your reply,
and will only add that as we must begin somewhere, it
seems natural to begin with that institution that is of the
least importance.
Lord Mayor. I can recognise no institution as being
of greater importance than the Corporation.
Commissioner. Then I will trouble your Lordship no
further.
THE MOAN OF THE "NATIVE."
"Of all the inanimate objects which are inimical to the oyster,
there is nothing eo fatal as sand."
Land and Water, Oct. 23, 1880.
'Tis the voice of the oyster, I hear him complain;
"I can't live in this place, here's the sandstorm again.
I was settling to rest 'mid the rocks and the tiles
They had made for a home, but this sand how it riles.
It gets into my shell, and the delicate fringe
That I use when I breathe; and I can't shut my hinge
When the grit lodges there: so the crabs ceme at will,
Since my poor mouth is open they feed, and they kill.
I 've complained to FRANK BUCKLAND, who quite under-
stands,
But he can't undertake to abolish the sands."
Thus the "Native" made moan, then I took up the
brown
Bread-and-butter and lemon, and swallow'd him down I
"AN INCREASING DANGER."
UNDER this heading "F. R. S." wrote to the Times
last week to show that at any minute the telegraphic
wire stretched over the streets might break, and, descend-
ing with irresistible force, strangle people in the road
beneath. This is a timely warning to Conductors.

somewhat hurried perusal of his work, we make from memory,
as having a special interest for the student—e. g. .—HENRY THK
EIGHTH to CHARLES JAMES MATHEWS, asking for a second-hand
copy of BOSWELL'S Johnson, and C. J. M.'s characteristic reply;
Lady BLESSINQTON to Cardinal WOLSKY, asking for a seat in his
box for JOHN PARRY'S Benefit at the Gaiety Theatre; Queen ELIZA-
BETH to DOUGLAS JERROLD, offering him her hand and heart if he
would continue the Caudle Lectures, and JERHOLD'S reply, which so
enraged the Queen that she executed the Earl of ESSEX, straight
off, and said that after her death "Caudle" would be found
on her heart; Dean SWIFT to Archbishop CRANHEB on Irish Dis-
establishment; CHARLES THE FIRST to Lord NELSON on the Author-
ship of "JUNIUS ;" Sir WALTER RALEIGH to W. M. THACKERAY.
on allowing pipes to be smoked at EVANS'S Supper-Rooms, and
THACKERAY'S answer to the effect that he considered cigars more
genteel; ROGER ASCHAM to HANNAH MORE, inviting her to a
oal masque after the Opera, and her reply, accepting the invita-
tion; OLIVER CROMWELL to MACREADY, asking the latter's opinion
as to his probable success should he, then a young man, give up the
brewing business, and go on the stage; and MACREADY to CROM-
WELL, telling him plainly that he couldn't expect more than a
shilling a night at Pantomime time, but might make something extra
by sitting as a model for a Big Head.
THE I-DEAL V. THE DEAL BOATMAN.
(An Illusion Dispelled.)
I KNEW him well. Not that I had ever seen him in the flesh-
but I had read often and often of him. I knew his " grand massive
face, furrowed with care, and exposure to a thousand storms. Yet
strong and self-reliant as the face of a man who nightly wrestled
with death" ( From " Braving the Breakers." A story in the Christ-
mas number of the St. John's Wood Gazette.) I knew his presence
of mind, his great calmness in moments of peril. I could see him,
"lashed to the tiller, with the pitiless storm howling around him,
and the fiery waves leaping and boiling high over him, yet did he
look forth into the night, and guide his boat as skilfully as a keeper
in the Zoological Gardens might direct the untamed elephant."
(From " Saved from the .Barque; or, Worse than its Bite" A Novel.)
And I knew of his honesty and his courage. Were not their reputa-
tions world-wide?
******
It was very dark now, and the storm was shrieking with .increased
rage across the breakers.
A crowd had collected on the beach, and all stood gazing out to sea.
"Heaven help them poor souls as is abroad this night," said the
old boatman, and dashed a tear from his eye.
"Amen!" said the crowd solemnly.
Every second they heard the minute guns.
Then the doomed ship burnt blue-lights.
"Splice my bowsprit!" shrieked the clear-eyed old Boatman,
'but it is the Mary Jane that is breaking up on the Goodwins."
The tall figure of the Colonel was ia the midst of the group.
"It is the Mary Jane, and on board her is my mother-in-law."
They respected his grief, and there was silence, only broken by the
mad fury of the waves.
"A thousand pounds!" cried the Colonel, who had only been
recently married, "to the man who rescues my mother-in-law!"

TRUE DOMESTIC SYMPATHY.
Wife of his Bosom (after learning thai he has lost a fortune on the Stock Ex-
change). "WILL YOU PROMI8B HE ONS THING?"
He (repentant). "WHAT? NEVBK TO ENTER THE CITY MOBS?"
She. "So, DABLING—BUT THAT YOU WON'T BE DISOOUBAOBD, AND WILL TRY

But before the words were out of his lips, BILL WALMEB had hastily divested
himself of his tall hat, and patent-leather boots, and with a rope in one hand,
was gallantly swimming the seven miles of disturbed ocean that separated the
wreck from the land.
It seemed years to the anxious lookers-on; but seven miles against wind
and tide take some swimming, even to an experienced boatman like BILL
WALMEB; and it was fully twenty minutes before a tug at the rope indicated
that he had reached the wreck. Then they began to haul in.
And they hauled in BILL WALMBB, who was closely embracing the fainting
figure of a female.
"Saved!" cried the Colonel. "Brave heart, brave heart!"
"I promised a thousand pounds to the man who saved my mother-in-law.
WILLIAM WALMEB, the thousand pounds are yours. Take them!'
"Sir," said WALMEB, with a pride that ennobled his homely features, "take
back your wealth. I have done my duty. I need no gold for it."

I determined to see my hero, the Deal Boatman, face to face, I would gaze
into his bold eyes, I would wring his honest hand. I arrived at Deal. I
hurried to the beach. There, on a bench, I .saw sitting my Deal Boatman.
I «at on the bench and remarked—
'Fine weather, my hearty tar."
'Dang the foine weather. What's the use of foine weather when there
am t no soul in the place."
'You 've had a good season, I hope?"

to me, 'I am going to stop here a longish time, and I wants a safe, steady,
"onest boatman to go fishing with.' So says 1,1 am yer man ;' and we goes
out together, and he pulls out a couple of letters, and reads them to his wife,
and he says to me, 'My man, one of these 'ere letters is from Sir WILFBID
LAWSON,' and I says, 'Oh, he be jiggered!' and he laughs and says ''Tother 's
from Mr. POPE, Q..C.,' and I knowed what a ft.C. was, having been in Maidstone,
but never mind, and I says, ' What's his game?' and he says, 'Why he's
the great man in the Anti-Tobacco Society,' and I says, 'Oh, lor" I' and
thought what a nice cheerful lot I 'd got 'old of."
"And they had good sport, I hope?" I put in.
"What do you think ?—as they thinks it funny to say
at Margate. Was I a going to row out a long way and
choose a good spot for a party whs hadn't neither ajar
of beer or a pinch of baccy on board P Not me!"
Somehow or other this conversation didn't exactly fit
in with my preconceived notions of the Deal Boatman,
but as yet I did not despair, so began again.
"They prophesy stormy weather, and in that case I
fear we shall be hearing of some more wrecks on those
sands there."
"So much the better."
I wasn't wrong. He yearned for the storm, to show
his courage, his neroism. He longed once again to fight
the elements. It was his ardent desire once more to
rescue life. Great heart! Gallant soul I How I had
wronged him!
"That's to say if they be decent wrecks."
'Decent wrecks?" I inquired.
"Wrecks, with a bit of stuff about 'em. There was
one 'ere the other day; and we went out, and brought
seven coves ashore; and, bless me, if they weren't High-
t alums: and all we got was twenty quid a-piece, bless
their eyes 1"
"Then you think of money?"
"In course. What should I think of? Do you think
I am such a blanked old fool as go off on a beast of a
night, if there weren't money 'anging to it? Do you
think I cares one solitary curse whether them coves was
drownded or not? Do you take me for a idjiot, as ought
to be in Canterbury Asylum?"
"But your great courage, your noble pluck?"
"Pluck, Sir; it's luck you mean. Some coves has
luck. I have only had one bit this year. Me and my
mates was off Ramsgate, and there was a yacht taken
in a calm as 'ad broken her bowsprit, and a swell on
board sings out, 'If you '11 tow me into Ramsgate
Arbour, you shall 'ave a sovereign, my lads 1' 'Tow
yourself, says I. 'I can't,' says he. ''Ave got no
dingey f 'Do it for fifty quid,'says I. 'Go to blazes I'
says he, and goes below. Then he comes up again, and
says, 'A fiver, my men!' 'We are enjoying the hocian
breezes,' says I,' and ain't in no hurry!' Well, to make
a long story short, he paid thirty-five at last; and it
was only a half-mile pull."
The world was out of joint. Anything might happen.
One of mv illusions was gone for ever. My faith was
shattered. How I struggled to say " You have a vote,"
I know not.
"In course I have, or, rather, I had. I should just like
to get 'old of that MB. GOLDSMIDT, shouldn't I treat him
like a conger heel?"
"I didn't understand you quite."
"Why, I should pitch 'im on them stones there, and
dance on his 'ead. What call has he got to deprive
honest brave sailors as faces the perils of death of their
living? We have allus been bribed and allus would
have been but for him. And who is this 'ere blooming
Mr. JUNK, who says I ain't to have no certificate P"
"He is the Chief Commissioner. But why are you
to have no certificate?"
"'Cos he says so. I had a five-pun note from the
Tories, and a beggarly couple of sovereigns from t'other
side, and they guv it me 'cos I am a honest man, and
they knowed it. But Lor' love you, a honest, brave man,
as we Deal boatmen is well beknown to be, has no chance
nowadays. You aren't goin', are yer? You don't mean
to say you are goin' away after all this talk without
jiving me the price of a quart and a screw. What!
Well, then, a bob. A gentleman would have made it
arf-a-crown, but an honest, brave man nowadays"

by a few kind and well-chosen words of courteous

FROM OUR PUBLIC BOX.
IN a paragraph leader, "The Prince of WALES," supplied to the Times
(Oct. 23), we suppose by the regular Court Newsman, and perhaps edited quite
in a friendly way, by Mr. BABBETT, the Manager of the Theatre mentioned,
we read:—
"The Prince and Princess of WALES, and Prince JOHN of Glucksburg and Suite,
honoured the Court Theatre with ^heir presence on Saturday evening. The Prince of
WALES paid Madame MODJESKA high compliments as to her acting, and expressed his
admiration of the excellent manner in which the piece had been put on the stage by
Mr. HAKHKTT."
Nothing could be better than this, for all the members of the Royal Family
are known to be excellent judges of a good thing, and a published list of their
several opinions on the leading entertainments of the hour, would not fail to
be an immense boon to the wary playgoer. n
Moreover, it might even prove a decided advertisement for the performances
themselves. We would suggest the following specimens :—
Prince CHBISTIAN last night honoured the Lyceum Theatre with his presence.
At the close of the first Act His Royal Highness sent for Mr. ARTHTJE MATTHISON,
and expressed to him the distinguished disturbance he had experienced at his
ghastly deportment. Later in the evening His Royal Highness privately con-
gratulated Mr. IRVING on the exalted excellence of the arrangements he had
made for the care of the umbrellas'. ,
The Grand Duke of HESSE and Prince LEOPOLD paid yesterday afternoon
a visit to the Polytechnic Institution. On emerging from the diving-bell, their
Roval Highnesses both conveyed to the Directors severally an expression ot
their dumbfounded delight at the comfortable and roomy character ot the
conveyance, as well as their restrained satisfaction at the sudden appearance
of the Seal at the bottom. „ ,
Prince WILLIAM of PKTJSSIA and Suite visited the Folly Theatre on Saturday
evening last. Before leaving the house His Royal Highness expressed to
Mr. TOOLE the majestic merriment the whole party had experienced m following
the story of the Upper Crust carefully, with an Ollendorff, and two Dictionaries.
Such are a few of the particular models. For general purposes, however,
perhaps the following will he found the most useful:—
H.R.H. the Prince of WALES, having lately visited several of the leading
West End Theatres, has on one or two occasions availed himself of the oppor-
tunities thus offered him of graciously encouraging distinguished artistic merit
Dulce est Dis-slippery in Loco.
THE Athentfum, in its record of recent scientific pro-
ceedings, informs us that at a meeting of the—
"QUBKETT MICROSCOPICAL, Oct. 22, Mr. F. CRISP exhibited
an improved form of bottle slide."
Of course the Members all dined together afterwards,
in order to test Brother CRISP'S latest invention. They
wouldn't let such an opportunity slide, even though the
bottle did. It was very slippery walking home that
evening; and a microscopic eye was required to detect
various lamp-posts; and "Quekett" became a very
difficult word to pronounce clearly.
A Novelty.
WE learn from a weekly and very serious contem-
porary of the existence of—
"A NOVBL OCCUPATION.—France has just invented a new
occupation. A man goes about the streets of Paris bearing a
small tray, a pack of cards, a set of dominoes, and a dice-
box. With this stock-in-trade the man, who styles himself
'L'Amateur,' goes to the houses of inralids or idle persons, and
for a small fee plays games with them."
"Beautiful idea!" said Mrs. RAMSBOTHAH, Jan.,
who is not quite perfect in her French pronunciation.
"Of course he must be one of the gamins of Paris!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

TWO COMIC OPERAS.
HAD the Librettist, in adapting Les Mausquetaires au Courent,
remembered the good old farce of The Boarding-School, and trane-
'ormed the French piece into something thoroughly English, the
book" might have been less objectionable than it is at present.
In The Boarding - School the characters are drawn with a
jroadly humorous touch, and there is plenty of scope for good
rollicking fun of a gen-
uine farcical character.
The Mousqnetairen is a
dull comic Opera: the plot
is slight, the dialogue
(after the first little spark)
savours of vulgarity, and
the whole thing is neither
comedy, farce, nor bur-
lesque. Mr. PAULTON is
to be highly commended
for toning down his cha-
racter, which, in less
conscientiously artistic
hands, would have become
almost as repulsive as
that of the drunken officer,
who, disguised aa a monk,
uses the modern slang of
a Music Hall, speaks of a
girl as " a scorcher," which
much delights the Gallery,
KNAVE AND ABB6-A VERY Low and behaves in a way
CHURCHMAN. as out of keeping with
the particular situation
in which he should preserve his disguise as it is with the spirit of a
•work that, at least, professes to be aComic Opera! Heavens! Imagine
Count Almaviva talkingof Rusinii as " a scorcher," or Rotinn replying
to some question with " Not for Honey!" There are several objection-
able lines, but there is one—or there was on the first night—which
ought never to have been passed over by the Licenser if it existed
in the original MS. sent in to him. Its introduction, to say the
least of it, is offensive to good taste. Let us hope that the Librettist
erred through ignorance of the
original line he was parodying,
which, in all probability he attri-
buted to SHAXSPEABE.
The instrumentationis good, and
the accompaniments melodious;
but the airs—with the exception of
Mr. CELLI'S song, which does not
belong to the Opera at all, and is by
another composer,—are decidedly
commonplace and ineffective. The
chorus is well trained, the girls
are pretty, the dresses bright, and
the opening is so lively as to make
the remainder doubly disappoint-
ing. Miss ALICE MAY does too
much, and Mile. SYLVIA does
too little. The noble Comte was
represented by a Gentleman who
may be described as a Confi-
dential Amateur. He steadily
refused to face the audience, and delivered all his asides, as mosl
important secrets, to the Violoncello-player in the corner, who,
judging from his studied indifference, had probably heard them all
before. The Comte was the one funny thing in the Comic Opera.
Miss CLARA GRAHAM, first as'a mous-
quftnire and then as a nun, looked very
pretty, and acted carefully. The scenes
call for no special remark.
The music 's bv VARNKT,
The words are by FARNIE.
And there's an end of it. If it turns into
a success, we shall not be surprised, seeing
that Olivette has fucceedtd, though we
fancy that in this latter case Miss ST. JOHN
is the chief attraction. It will be some
time before we get a rival to Les docket
de Cornenlh.
Billee Taylor, si the Imperial, is quit
another affair. It is in two Acts, well pu
on the stage, charming old English
dresses designed by a Frenchman (M. PILO
TELL) and made by a French firm (AUGUSTS
& CIE.). There are a few pretty tunes, some well-executed choruses

ngeniously devised accompaniments, and no offence in plot or
iialogue from beginning to end. Why was it called " RILLKE."
which suggests burlesque when it is
described as a "G>mic Opera"? This
is irritating. With every wish to
give a most sincere and hearty welcome
to an English librettist and composer,
we are sorry that Messrs. STEPHENS—a
name of good omen so near the Houses of
Parliament—and SOLOMON—who ought
to inherit a share of the hereditary wis-
dom—should have deliberately chosen to
follow so closely in the footprints of
Messrs. GILBERT and SULLIVAN, as to
convey either the idea of bold rivalry or
intentional compliment. Had Messrs.
STEPHENS and SOLOMON adapted Messrs.
GILBERT and SULLIVAN'S names to their
own, and described themselves as Messrs.
GFLPHENS andSuLLiMON, we should have
known what to expect; but though we
may regret that Masters STEPHENS and
SOLOMON should have chosen to enter themselves as pupils in this
larticular school, vet, as the boys insist on a competitive examina-
;ion, we are bound to place them in the first
;lass and award them a prize. But Sillee —
Why Bil/ee .* Very annoying!)—is not the
measure either of their ambition or their
capabilities.
The music is light and pretty, but provok-
ngly like " something you've heard before,"
which in itself has been found by eminent
composers a sure element of success when
combined with original treatment. The most
jriginal, and happily the best thing in the
whole piece is the Chant of Charity girls—
their chorus—unaccompanied, dei-cribing
their duties, to which the orchestra plays
Amen." This is excellent.
Master SOLOMON has evidently taken a
great fancy to one of the learned Dr. SUL-
LIVAN'S tunes in Cox and Bux — " Three
years ago"—as he has given us an inkling
of it first in Billee Taylor's song-(Why
Bilfe* t Provoking !)-and a seoonf time in
Mr. STOYLE'S song, "All f«r the take «f
Eliza," where Master SOLOMON seems really quite sorry to part with
the original model and substitute anything of his own. When
Mr. STOTLE began it with COLO-
MOW, we finished with SULLIVAN.
Sir Mincing Lane (Mr. ARTHUR
WILLIAMS) tells us "how he be-
came" what he is, just as Mr.
GILBERT'S characters do.
The stage business at the Imperial
is so over-elaborated as to become
more wearisome than what we are
now accustomed to at the Strand and
Globe, where the perpetual mechani-
cal motion of the chorus is now of an
idiotic stereotyped pattern.
But even played as it is—by the
way little Miss CHAMBERS is charm-
ing in it— those who are fond of this
form of Opera in this " school " will
be highly delighted with Billee—
(Why Bil/Ktf? Most worrying!) —
Taylor, and,
Spite of nil temptations
From other recreations,
will rusH to see the Prize work, by Masters H. P. STEPHENS and
SOLOJION, now performing at the Imperial.


Come at Last!
IN the list of the Banquet given by the late LORD MAYOR to the
Iloyal Academy on Wednesday, the last names are Mr. and Mrs.
MANNERS. Don't we all recollect how in childhood's happy but
gluttonous hours we were invariably bidden to leave the last piece in
the dish for Mr. MANNERS? Mr. MANNERS was by polite ftct on
always supposed to come late, and here he is at the Mansion Ho i«i?
actually last! What an excellent lesson to the Aldermen and the
regular City feeders who had preceded them. Let us hope that these
dilatory but distinguished gueste had been duly provided for, and
that something was left for Mr. and, of course, Mrs. MANNERS.

ENDYMION.
(A poetic fragment, apparently in imitation, of Keats, picked up in the
neighbourhood of Hughenden.)
A TURN for fiction is a joy for ever,
Its charm with age increases; it will never
Pass into prosineas, but still will keep
Seclusion roseate for us, and a sleep
Full of high dreams, and hopes ana ardent breathing;.
Therefore in my retirement am I wreathing
A flowery fiction to delight the earth.
Spite of Rad triumph, of the unhappy dearth
Of Tory voters, of the gloomy days,
Of all the bungling and word-darken'd ways
Of Old Verbosity: yes. in spite of all,
Bright shapes of splendour, move away the pall
From my calm spirit. Such he whom the Moon
On Latinos stooped to kiss; a blessed boon
For simple shepherd; such high souls whose wills
Sway the " green " world they dwell in, and whose quills,
In the cold shade of opposition, make
Things hot for their rivals, who in office quake
At the dread Nemesis that o'er them looms;
And such, too. is the grandeur of the dooms
One pictures for a Party not yet dead,
For all the tales in penny papers read—
Those spouting pumps of washy mental drink,
Poured daily out for dolts who dare not think.
I do not merely feel these presences
When high in power; no, e'en as the scant tress
That curls o'er aged temples becomes soon
Dear as youth's flowing locks, so, like the Moon,
Romance's reflex lustre, though not quite
The Sun of sway, becomes a cheering light
Unto my soul, bound unto me so fast,
That, whether skies be bright or overcast,
It always shall be with me till I die.
So 'tis with pleasure purposeful that I
Will tell the story of Endymion.

WHEN an indignant Londoner complains that London has the
wont supply of the worst cabs of any city claiming to be civilised,
he forgets the conditions under which the Cabman works. The
Cabman is the one labourer whose hire is regulated by a meddling
Government. In hail, rain, or sun, pushing through the block of
Cheapside or galloping along an open road, his fare, according to
Act of Parliament, is always the same. The usual result follows.
When the fogs come on. or the snow lies upon the ground, he retires
sulkily to his home, and leaves the Metropolis cabless.
Over-regulated by Government, and patronised by a few philan-
thropists, ne is now worried by Vestries. A few charitable people
have subscribed to provide him with " Shelters," which are erected
in certain districts by permission of the local authorities. These
Shelters are Arks of Refuge in which he can get tea, coffee, and food,
and warm himself between one journey and another; that is, if he
itops in a neighbourhood where the Vestry is not opposed to Shelters.
The Vestry of St. George's, which watches over Pimlioo, appears to
object to such structures—at least the tradesmen majority of that
body have carried a resolution to remove a Shelter, which was much
needed, near Victoria Station. _ A generous lady, with the appro-
priate name of TKOTTER, provided this Shelter, and it was erected
near the Station until the Kail way Directors found that it conflicted
with the legal rights of their Refreshment Contractor. It was then
removed to Stockbridge Terrace. Some of the inhabitants objected
to this site. Sixteen hundred cabmen petitioned in its favour. The
V«itry (the tradesmen majority) listened to the inhabitants, and the
unfortunate Shelter was removed. After being nearly offered to the
St. Pancras Station, it was decided to pack it away, and at present it
awaits another decision of the guardians of Pimlioo.
As the Cabmen's Shelter Society has now between twenty and
thirty structures of this kind erected temporarily in various parts of
London, it is not easy to see why that Wilderness of Stucco, known
generally as "Pimlioo," should deny the sixteen hundred Cabmen
this little harmless comfort. There is nothing in the new-born
respectability of Pimlico to j ustit'y this exolusiveness; and we presume
the older element of the neighbourhood is not consulted on these
questions. If the Seldom-at-Home SECRETARY would carry Molly
Coddling legislation in Cabs a step farther, and provide Shelters or
Stables for cab-horses and cabs, as well as for Cabmen, he might
help to justify the interference of Government in a particular trade,
and help the grumbling Londoner to a superior class of vehicle.
"Ads" and Ends.
WE have several gems from the Emerald Isle. They are mostly
applications for Land Agencies, which in itself would speak volumes
for the peaceable prospects of the country, were it not for the general
insistanoe on the applicants' qualifications as good shots. The fol-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BURGER AND BOUCICAULT.
SINCE our notice of The Cor-
fican Druthers at the Lyceum
we have received numerous re-
plies to the query concerning
the origin of the line "The
dead travel fast." As the
words in question seemed to be
rather an adaptation of an idea
than an exact quotation from
Leonore, we "paused for a
reply" which should convince
us that Mr. BOUCICAULT had
really intended to quote BUK-
GEK, and here we have proof
positive in Nutet and Qiteries,
from which we make the fol-
lowing extract:—
""THB DEAD TBAVKt PAST."—
In Punch, Oct. 2, is a critique on
Mr. IKVINO'S production of The
Corticaa Brothera at the Lyceum
Theatre, in which is the following
sentence: 'By the way, Sir. BOUCI-
CAULT makes farbyung say, "The
dead travel fast," which is about
the one good line in the piece—
only, where did it come from?'
Mr. IRVING uses the version brought out by CHAHLBH KEIN at the Prin-
cess's Theatre, Feb. 24, 1852, but in another version of the drama that was
published at that time I find the following :—
"' Mont, i! ... can you possibly have obtained these Bad details 10 quickly P
"' Fab. You forget the ballad of BUKOKH., Monnieur—" The dead travel
fast."'

"LlVITID'
LOUT.
"CCTHBERT BEDS."
"This answers Mr. Punch'i question.
Whose was "the other version "? By the way, quoting poetry is
rather out of keeping with the character of a gay Corsioan sportsman
like Farbyang. Thanks to Mr. COTHBEBT BEDE, who is evidently
flourishing, and not in the least " verdant green."
EASY GEOGKAPHY POE BEGINNERS.
Question. Now, will you first kindly inform me what, and also
where, is the Mediterranean Sea P
Answer. With the greatest pleasure. The Mediterranean Sea is
where it used to be—somewhere on the road to India, and somewhere
between Europe, Asia, Africa, Malta, and (I think) America, but
I 'm not quite sure about America. The three most important coun-
tries that it washes are Italy, Greece, and Turkey. It has been en-
gaged in washing Turkey from the very earliest ages, but it doesn't
seem to have got it all clean yet. The chief use to which this most
convenient piece of water is generally put is as a theatre for Naval
Damonstrationsj and other histrionic performances. At the present
moment it is being used for a Concert, in which all the Great Powers
take a share. To be followed by a "Screaming Faroe," in which
the chief performers will be Turks and Albanians, entitled Dulcigno;
or, Don't you wish you may get it T
Q. What are the limits of European Turkey?
A. Turkey is bounded on the north by rising Nationalities, and on
the south by broken pledges; on the west by the Naval Demonstra-
tion, and on the east by the Black Sea Fleet.
Q. Why are these Nationalities that you have just mentioned
called "rising" Nationalities?
A. Obviously because of a curious natural habit which they
possess, of rising in revolt against Turkey on the slightest provoca-
tion, or none at all.
Q. What are the chief products of Turkey?
A. Pachas and Promises. The latter are always broken, while
the former, unfortunately, are—kept.
Q. Can you tell me what is the form of Government in Turkey?
A. Of course I can! Anything you like to ask. Turkey hasn't
got much Government of any sort. What there is, is framed on the
amiable principle of taxing the people heavily for protection to life
and property, and then leaving life and property entirely unpro-
tected.
Q. Is there any other Country in Europe with at all a similar form
of Government?
A. Yes—Ireland.
Q. What is—or ought to be—Turkey's National Motto P
A. "My word is as good as my bonds," and not a penny to chooie
between them.
Q. For what is Greece chiefly celebrated?

"OLD KING COAL" AND THE FOG DEMON.
WELL, yes, Old King Coal it a jolly old soul,
And 'twill be a long time 'ere the world wags without him;
But he needs Constitutional check and control,
And so do the minions he's gathered about him.
The rollicking autocrat isn't King Log,
But his rule's not all rosy, a thing to remember,
When finding we meet with the first of the fog
'Ere we part with the last of September.
The Smoke Fiend, his comrade, 's a murderous ghoul,
With long patient London is playing Old Gooseberry,
Soot-columns foul, belched from chimney and cowl,
The town in a stench as of long stagnant ooze bury.
Gets London immenser, grow denser and denser
Its fog-veil, less easy and wholesome for breathing,
As though fetid fumes from some demon-swung censer
The town in miasma were wreathing.
Still lengthens, still strengthens, the sway of the pest,
Its malodorous puffings still smoke us and choke us,
Till each nf us feels he 's a flue for a chest
From Michaelmas right on to March and the crocus.
Five months of asphyxia out of the year,
With dark as or Tophet, and smells as of sewage,
Are rather ton much. Who will help London clear
Of the Smoke Demon's annual brewage?
'Tis long 'ere a Londoner's patience will fail;
But 'tis hard half the year to live silent and placid
In darkness Egyptian, with nought to inhale
But unconsumed carbon, and sulphurous acid.
How long shall we vainly assistance invoke P
How long must we bow to this Autocrat grim knee P
Our City disfigured, its populace choked,
A prey to the Ghoul of the Chimney?
Let Science and Law take the matter in hand,
The former has ever for victory thirsted:
And will she sit silent in impotence bland.
By coal fires and chimney reek utterly worsted?
Death's jackal, disease's sworn ally, the friend
Of discomfort, and dirt, and destruction Fiend Fog is.
'Tis time to take thought, and the tyranny end
Of this blackest of Babylon's Bogies I
Satisfactory Solution.
AIT Extractor sends us the following cutting from The Standard
in full bloom :—
A Well-educated young SAILOR (four years as apprentice and two
years second mate), a total abstainer from birth, REQUIRES a SITUA-
TIOIT in London; good writer; undeniabl* references.
How can he " abstain from birth"? This is what " Extractor"
wants to know. Clearly a very wide-awake sailor is one who will
always be on the watch, and never go to sleep; and so "birth1'
is simply a misprint for " berth." This solves the mystery. That
he should be a second mate does not necessarily imply that he has
been twice a widower.
FROM BBDFOliD TOWN.

old Kiver, "but I'll show 'em 'Onse 'oo!'" And he overran his

QUALITY v. QUANTITY.
Ous (to Frank, who is chaffing Mm about his thin legs). "MY DEAR
FKLLOW, WE CAN'T ALL BE CART-HORSKS. USEFULNESS ISN'T EVERY-
THING, YOU KNOW; AND THBKB MUST BE A FEW TaOROTOHBRKM,
BERK AND THBRE, IF ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF ORKAMXXTI"
OUR OWN CITY COMMISSION.
The Chamberlain.
Our Commissioner. What are your principal duties, Mr. Cham-
berlain?
Chamberlain. I am the Banker of the Corporation, and take care
of their money, when they happen to have any. 1 keep all their
accounts, and balance all their books—sometimes a very difficult
operation when they are all on one side; in fact so difficult that I am
allowed about a dozen clerks to help me.
O. C. Do the Corporation finances require very careful manage-
ment?
Ch. Very. I am indeed so careful not'to'allow the candle to he
burnt at both ends, that I am called the great Save-All of the Cor-
poration.
O. C. You are also, I presume, their ceremonial officer?
Ch. No, I am not. I never stand upon ceremony, but do pretty
much as I like.
O. C. What other duties have you?
Ch. I punish refractory apprentices. I always lecture and some-
times imprison them; and I have been told that they would rather
have the imprisonment than the lecture.
O._C. Dear me! How very strange! That seems to suggest a
solution of the difficulty -with juvenile offenders. I will make a
note for Sir WILLIAM HARCOTOT.
CA. I have also power to punish bad Masters, and to give them
two months' imprisonment as hrst-class miscreants.
O. C. What is your salary P
CA. I have no salary.
O. C. Dear me I No salary!
CA. No: no salary—only an allowance.
O. C. What, then, is your allowance P
CA. From £1,500 to £2,500 per annum, dependent npon'my success.
O. C. Will you kindly explain that?
CA. I have often endeavoured, but never yet succeeded, so must
decline any further attempt.
O. C. As a fact, what do you receive?
CA. As a fact, two thousand five hundred a year.
O. C. Always?
CA. Always.
O. C. Then you are always successful?
CA. Yes, to that extent.
O. C. Happy man 1 Do you give any security?
Ch. Oh, yes, I have two of CHUBB'S best iron safes, with three keys
to each of them, and three clerks to lock them up.
O. C. Ah, that's something like. Do you find any sureties?
CA. Yes, I found two last week.
O. C. What did you do with them?
CA. I handed them over to the Police for safe custody.
O. C. Dear me I How very singular 1 Do you want your
allowance increased?
CA. Most decidedly; but not immediately.
O. C. Why not immediately?
Ch. Well, sometimes we consider it more prudent to ask for a lump
sura, on account, as it were.
O. C.^Have you lately had a lump sum presented to you?
CA. Yes.
O. C. How much?
CA. £2.500.
O. C. Dear me! the Corporation seem to be very liberal masters.
CA. They are not my masters.
O. C. Not your masters I Then who are?
CA. The Liverymen of London, the most important constituency
m the whole kingdom.
O. C. How so, Mr. Chamberlain P
CA. They elect the Lord Mayor, they elect the Sheriffs, they elect
four Members of Parliament, and they elect ME. It takes only one
day to elect an M.P., it takss fifteen to elect a Chamberlain.
O. C. You speak of the Livery as a model constituency?
CA. Yes, certainly.
O. C. Have I not heard of Long-Shoremen as a part of your
model constituency?
CA. Probably.
O. C. Pray what is a Long-Shoreman?
CA. I believe "NUTTALL" defines him to be a poor Liveryman,
occupied along the shore of the river, who has the reputation of
selling his vote at elections.
O. C. What is about the present "price of a Long-Shoreman's
vote?
CA. I am quite unable to answer.
O. C. What was it when you were elected?
CA. Those small details have quite escaped my memory.
O. C. What did your election cost you P
CA. I have quite forgotten.
O. C. You can ascertain, I suppose?
CA. No; all my papers relating thereto were unfortunately burnt.
O. C. (compassionately). Dear me!
CA. (sympathetically). Quite so I
O. C. From what I gather, Mr. Chamberlain, there seem to be
several little mysteries in the constitution of the Corporation some-
what difficult of comprehension.
CA. Yes—(quietly)—I 'm one of 'em.
O. C. On what ground, pray, did you base your application for a
grant of money?
CA. The great rise in the price of butter.
O. C. The price of butter?
CA. Yes; I have to use very large quantities when admitting
gentlemen to the Freedom of the City, and I have great difficulty in
finding " fresh" butter for these interesting occasions.
O. C. Anything further P
CA. Nothing further.
O. C. You may retire, Mr. Chamberlain.
CA. Thank you, I have no wish to retire.
O. C. I mean you may go.
CA. Oh, thank you.

BRAVO, ALDERMAN!
IN the Times' report of the
Thursday sittings at Guildhall
last week we read :—
"After hearing tome more cases of
cruelty, Alderman NOTTAGK said he
could not leave the Bench without
calling attention to the fact that all
the cases wliirh had been brought
before him that day had been charges
of cruelty to hones. He had had no
fewer than eight defendants before
him, and it was surprising that in a
city like this there should be such an
amount of cruelty. It had now come
to this, that the Magistrates of the
City must adopt a different course, and
instead of fining those who so brutally
ill-used dumb animals they would
have to send them to prison without
the option of a fine, so that if they
could not feel for their horses they
might be made to feel for themselves.'
And mightn't they have a taste
of the whip they use so freely
themselves just with a little knot-
tage in it?

HOW I BECAME A LORD MAYOR.
{After a, Music-Hall Model.)
WHEW I was a youngster at Derry,
I showed early signs of success.
I was careful of ha'pence—yes. very;
And I grew crops of mustard and cress.
I never left pins in the gutter;
Paid cabmen exactly their fare,
Till my friends, in astonishment utter,
Said "Bless us—he '11 end as Lord Mayor 1
That boy will become a Lord Mayor,
That boy will become a Lord Mayor,
So please to remember
The Ninth of November,
That boy will become a Lord Mayor."
Each ha'penny changed to a shilling;
And I think that the reason may be
Why people in Lambeth were willing
To give me some change as M.P.
So I sat in the House—where I voted
With a highly respectable air,
And my speeches were so little quoted—
That the world said, "He's safe for Lord Mayor!
That man, he '11 become a Lord Mayor," &c.
Though of dear gay Sir WILFRID'S supporters,
The gayest, yet still, now and then,
I am held for (in serious quarters),
A "light" among model young men.
Be the work in Fiji,—spite the jokers,
I Ve always been game for a share,
Till my Christian Friends, in white chokers,
Have sighed, "Oh, he mutt be Lord Mayor.
That light must flare up a Lord Mayor," &o.
So, much to discretion beholden—
To the social distinction that tells;
With my gaze on the perch that is golden,
I shall mix, a whole twelvemonth,_with Swells!
And as friends, who once knew me in Derry,
See me seated at last in the chair.
They'll observe, "Well, it's singular, very—
But, bless us, Me ARTHUR 'a Lord Mayor I
That boy has become a Lord Mayor,
That boy has become a Lord Mayor!
So, long we '11 remember
This Ninth of November
That made our McAETHUB Lord Mayor!"
AVHAT ST. GILES'S SAYS.
THE Meddlevex Magistrates, like ALEXANDER THE GREAT, are
sighing for new worlds to conquer. Not content with licensing and
exterminating Music and Dancing, they are turning their attention
to Convents and Religious Ceremonies. In a short time we may
expect to see them trying to lay hands upon the Press, and after that
upon Literature and Art. Lord ALFRED CHURCHILL is the moving
spirit. With Lord ALFRED on the Bench, and Lord RANDOLPH in
Parliament, who shall say that the perpetual £4000 per aTinnm
allowed to the Dukes of MABLBOROUOH has fallen upon barren
ground?
We are a great and liberal country. The sun never sets upon our
dominions. We collect and spend one hundred and twenty millions
sterling a year, and glory in our pension list In spite of this, how-
ever, the sun before alluded to seldom passes over London without
witnessing a death from absolute starvation. Last week, amongst
other oases, an American journalist died from want of food on the
Thames Embankment, and an English artist perished in a back
room in Marylebone. The sun, before alluded to, would probably
blush if a statue of the journalist, stating the cause of death, were
raised on the Embankment, and a statue of the artist, with a similar
inscription, were put up in the Regent's Park. We want a few solid
monuments of National Disgrace to teach us that Bumbledom is not
perfect.

"Tableau I"
The Licensing Authorities are not always happy in their prohibi-
tive action. At Brighton they lately abolished a wine-bar on the
Marine Parade,_ with the view of improving the neighbourhood, and
the proprietor immediately set up a Done-and-rag shop on the same
premises. Perhaps Lord ALFRED CHURCHILL will make a note of
this? _
The nezt time (let us hope it will be the last time) that Lord
ALFRED CHURCHILL and his colleagues are called upon to legislate
on Music and Dancing, they might try to copy a Somersetshire
Magistrate, named Mr. T. E. KOOEBS. This Magistrate replied to
certain Clergymen, who wished to limit the hours of village festivals,
that he had a hearty dislike for all unnecessary restrictions on public
liberty. He expected Governments to punish offences against order.
instead of interfering with the legitimate freedom of purchase and
sale. He regretted to see the Clergy banded together for the purpose
of hampering popular recreations, and of "making those sad whom
the Lord has not made sad." Mr. KOOEBS' s name ought to be
changed to HAMPDEJT. _
The Duke of MUDFORD is idle in Mud-Salad Market, but slightly
active in Mudfordshire. The valley of the Ouse is overflowing with
water. Nearly three hundred years ago a simple gentleman found
more water in Hertfordshire than the county required, and at great
cost and labour he brought it to a dirty metropolis. This was Sir
HUGH MTDDLETON, who earned the eternal gratitude of Londoners.
London has now too much Ducal mud, and the Ouse has too much
water. "What does the Duke of MUDFORD do P He calls feebly upon
the Government to remove the water. "Will he call upon the
Government to remove the mud, and will the Government bring the
water to wash away the filth of Mud-Salad Market P Judging from
our recent domestic legislation, the whole question will be buried in
one of those vaults of legislation — a Parliamentary Committee-Boom
— with a Blue-book for a tombstone.
Mr. HrsKiy has joined the ranks of Dramatic Critics, and has
probably shocked the babblers about "Art" by openly preferring
an Ojpfra-Bouffe to a mouthing piece at the Fran«;ais. It is rather
late in the day, perhaps, to discuss the merits of Le Chalet, but Mr.
H.USKIX, like any other man, must learn his business. There was
once a dramatic reporter who treated Macbeth as a new piece by an
untried author; but, unfortunately for him (which is not always the
case), he wrote for readers a little less ignorant than himself. Mr.
RUSETN, on his return from France, wfll doubtless pay the London
theatres a visit, and address himself to a Metropolitan instead of to
a provincial audience.
The Corporation are in a difficulty with the Strand Board of "Works
about the refuge at the foot of the Temple Bar Monstrosity. The
Strand Board object to the refuge on the west side, and Mr. BEDFORD
plaintively says that this decision would make the structure look
like a pig with one ear. Sorely the ear on the Corporation side is
quite long enough (perhaps too long) for all practical purposes.
A WORD FOR THE SOLDIER.
"It is a positive fact, though it seems almost incredible, that the uniform
coat of an ordinary soldier is regarded as a bar to his admission to many
public assemblies."—Duke of Cambridge at the Mansion Souse, Nov. 3.
Is Her Majesty's uniform such a disgrace,
That a soldier when drest in it can't show his face
In a public assembly? Yes, shameful to say
This is what, as the Duke says, occurs every day;
But the shame, Punch opines, surely rests upon those
Who thus scout the brave men who defend us from foes:
Who have worn the old uniform heedless of soars
From the Pole to Equator in numberless wars;
They have made it respected abroad, when they roam,
Let them find it is equally honoured at home.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
Wettminster Hall.
"WffEW the edifice is finished in the Strand, and the Courts are
transferred from West to East, "Rufus' Masterpiece" will have to
rely purely upon historical recollections for distinction. Feeling this,
I naturally wished to visit It once again before it sank into Compara-
tive insignificance. It was said that the old building is seen to
greatest advantage on the occasioh of a Coronation or a trial for Sigh
Treason. I saw it at its "second best," i.e., on the First Day of
Term.
When I arrived, the Hall was cfowded with a body of highly re-
spectable spectators. A large portion of the audience were Ladies,
attended by members of the very Jtmior Bar. These possible Lord
Chancellors, were dressed in wigs and gowns that apparently had
seen but little service since they were first exhibited before a "pen-
sion" of callous Benchers eh a recent " Call Day." In spite of this,
however, these juvenile aspirants to the Woolsack seemed quite
happy and contented as "each and every of them" moved aTiout
a cheery head-centre of a group of awe-stricken but admiring
spinsters. Loungers of all ages, and both sexes filled up the back-
ground. A little before two o clock the Civil Power cleared a road
from East to West, and all was expectation. We waited anxiously
to see a sight that we knew intuitively would touch us to the very
quick. We were to behold the Law in all its majesty and might.
There was a long pause, and it was difficult to restrain our pent-up
feelings. At last arose a cry of "They are coming!" and the sound
of fprancing steeds was heard in Palace Yard. Then the rumour
cirdttlated amongst the eager multitude that the LORD CHATTCET-LOE
was at the door, perhaps oft horseback, surrounded by a body of
Mounted Police with drawn, swords. It was supposed that this
military display was intended to strike terror into the craven souls
of the Metropolitan burglars, and thus save the Mace. But still
we had to wait. Forced Inaction gave us time to examine a gorge-
ously apparelled person, who seemingly had emerged from one of
the offices belonging to the Houses of Parliament. We asked a few
bystanders wh i it was, but nobody knew for certain, and a few sug-
gested that he might be the Clerk of the House (whatever that may
be), or a detective in plain clothes. As he did nothing in support of
either character, the few spectators whose notice he had attracted
soon lost all interest in him. That man missed a big opportunity of
making himself famous.
At last a gentleman in a black Court suit appeared, carrying a
richly-embroidered pouch. It was with immense difficulty that we
repressed giving him three hearty British cheers. On seeing him,
an old lady informed us that " she believed the LORD MAYOR must
be coming, as this was a Sheriff." We consequently regarded him
with increased curiosity. However, as no one joined him, the enthu-
siasm ,began to
cool, and we
were falling
back into our
old condition of
wistful expect-
ancy when a
second gentle-
man in black
Court dress ap-
peared, stag-
gering under
an enormous
mace. "He
always puts
that out of the
carriage-window on Lord Mayor's Day, because there's not room
for it inside, you know," was the knowing old lady's whispered
commentary. Then the Police touched their helmets, and a digni-
fied individual, in an enormous wig, a gaudy black-and-gold gown,
and knee-breeches, entered Westminster Hall. Again we wanted to
cheer, but were half afraid. At last some bold spirits in the back-
ground ventured to murmur a distinct, but respectful "Hurray!"
The dignified individual paused, turned round, and looked towards
the door. Something was evidently preventing him from progressing
further. In a moment a third gentleman in black Court dress and
a sword, appeared, hastily seized the dignified individual's train,
and held it up. The difficulty in perambulation thus happily sur-
mounted, the little party marched gaily away towards the end of
the building. Then came another long pause; in fact, a long pause
formed the chief part of the procession. By-and-by we were satis-
fied by the abrupt appearance of a second dignified individual, in a
similar costume to that worn by the first. Again there was a
difficulty about progressing, until another gentleman kindly assisted
in carrying the train. Never were such troublesome trains, not even
at Waterloo Station I Never were—I should say never wear—such
trains. I won't—till I'm obliged. And then just let me catch the

gintleman who'11 dare tread on the tail of my coat. Bedad! I'd floor
him with the mace. I was told afterwards that attached to the
office of train-bearer was some trifling salary—about £300 per
annum. And, taking one thing with another, 1 am not at all sure
the service was dear at the money I The party of two followed the
party of four, and then came a miscellaneous collection of more or
less dignified individuals attired much after the same fashion, but
apparently resenting the fact that they had no one to look after
their trains. Trains without any guards, drivers, or stokers. For
this reason, probably, they did not attempt any order, and were,
consequently, rather mixed. There was another pause, and a body
of full-bottomed wig-wearers entered the Hall, closely pursued by a
surging mob. There was a little cheering and a good deal of pushing,
and the ceremony was over.
As I hurried away, I heard the same old lady I had listened to
before, explaining to her friends "that in her young days there
were bands of music, men in armour, and lots of flags." She added,
as a comforting second thought, ." but perhaps, after all, they may
have left them outside!"
I was carried with the stream into one of the Courts. It was
crowded with a portion of the audience that had just quitted the
Hall. The Members of the very
Junior Bar were in full force, but
now they seemed to be haughtily
ignoring the presence of the more
than ever awe-stricken spinsters, as
they humbly occupied seats behind
them. The looks of these coming
Cockbttrns said in so many words—
"Down, down, fluttering hearts!
Away, away all gentle feelings! We
are on duty! Behold us in our brand
new wigs and gowns! We are wor-
thily representing the Bar of Eng-
land!" By-and-by two judges took
their seats upon the Bench, after
bowing to the Bar and receiving the
Bar's respectful salutation. Suddenly there was a good deal of angry
whispering and pushing, and a gentleman in a full-bottomed wig
fought his way to the front row. The Presiding Judge bowed to
him, and invited him to take his place in the foremost pen amongst
the Queen's Counsel. There was a good deal of bustling, and the
gentleman obeyed the direction. Then he bowed to the Judges, who
bowed in return; then to the Q.C.'s, who also bowed in return; then
to the Members of the very Junior Bar, who responded to the courtesy
with effusion, as if they were greatly delighted at being included in
the day's proceedings. "Do you move, Mr. SOMEBODY?" asked the
Presiding Judge. Mr. SOMEBODY moved with a vengeance as he
sprang up like a jack-in-the-box, bowed jerkily, and sank back into
his seat without uttering a word. Then all the wigs in Court bowed
copiously to one another. Then, like the rush of the whirlwind,
Mr. SOMEBODY hurried from the pen, and was seen fighting in the
distance as he made manfully towards the door of the Court. As
the proceedings now turned out to be of a purely perfunctory
character, I, too, quitted the apartment for another. I had scarcely
reached my i destination before I saw
something white bobbing up and down
in a sea of heads. The something
(amidst a murmur of disapprobation
which grew louder and louder) oame
nearer and nearer until it reached the
first desk. The something was the
full-bottomed wig of Mr. SOMKBODT,
Q.C.
Again the Presiding Judge was cour-
teous in his invitation. Again the
Members of the very Junior Bar joined
in the proceedings with the utmost
heartiness. There was unlimited bow-
ing as before. "Do you move, Mr.
SoMEHODYF" asked the Presiding Judge,
and as no one seemed inclined to
"move," I did, and went into another

with a view to engaging in another bowing match with the Bar, the

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

ANNE MIE; OR, LA GRANDE DUTCHESSE.
THE story of Anne Mit ii simply this: At seventeen Anne is
betrayed by an English Engineer, whom her father stabs, and leaves
for dead. That's Act I. Eighteen years elapse; Dirkten, her
father, is imbecile, and haunted by the ghost of his victim. Anne
Mil's daughter is passed off
as her niece, Lite, in the
village where they have
come to settle. Koenraad,
a young Dutchman, will
marry Lite if her parentage
is without stain. The Eng-
lish Engineer turns up in
time to "make an honest
woman" of Anne Mie.
whioh legitimises Zw«,—
thereby converting the play
into a specimen of the Lrgi-
y~_ L *rv-^iv •^•H N^K timate Drama,—and all ends
•»^^^ happily—as far as the cha-
THB Aucu ANNE Mm AND TUB FIEND, racters are concerned. This
takes four AuU to tell, and
there is a villain in it who, except as useful in making a scene now and
then and diverting attention from the main incidents, is rather in the
way than otherwise, and is got rid of directly real business is meant.
Now, in a Dutch piece where they are all boers together, it would
be invidious to select any one character as a greater bore—we should
write "boer"—than the rest. What a beautiful chance for an
appropriate Dutch drinking-song, to the tune of " When we were
hoys together" has been lost by not letting Messrs. FERNANDA, DE
LANGK—a small boer—and FLOCKTON—an awful boer—aing a
finale of
When we were boera,
Merry, merry boers,
VI heu we were boera together,
which would at least have had the merit of bringing down the
onrtain long before its time.
Not having seen the original Dutch play, we are unable to draw a com-
parison between the two,
but are free to judge Anne iW^
Mie— pronounced Annie'
Mee—as an English play
on its own merits. As long
as the drama was in Dutch,
it was lauded to the skies
as being something mar-
vellous. But once put
into plain English the
spell was broken.
The story is neither new,
nor sensational, nor ex-
citing. It is a simple story
simply told in plain,
straightforward language.
The dialogue is generally
natural and not above the social stattu of the speakers. The stage
business is good, the pictures of Dutch life are quaint and interesting,
and the acting fair, but decidedly not great.
What on earth tempted Miss GEUBVI^VE WARD to play, or rather
to attempt to play, the part of a young and lovely girl of sweet
seventeen, as Anne Mie is supposed to be in the First Act P "There,"
may the adapter well say to himself, " there was the weight that
pulled me down, 0 CBTJMMLES!" Next we may well ask
iVhui did induce
Mr. EDOAR BHUCE,
to undertake the part of the Gay Young Engineer, the lover of Anne
Mie in the First Act? Seeing them together he really has the air
of a " young man from the
country," who is a greater
fool than he looks, and is
in a general _ way very
much to be pitied. Mr.
BUUCE is capital in
bustling, touch-and-go,
light-comedy parts, but
where tenderness, pathos,
and a certain dignity are
absolutely necessary to
prevent the character becoming ludicrous—and specially necessary
with such a very knowing Anne Mie, who looks as if she were up to
every move on the sea-board of Dutchland—Mr. BBUCE, to put it
plainly and colloquially, is "not in it."
In this unfortunate First Act, which need not have been retained,
u it is only a prologue that subsequent dialogue explains over and

SF.M'< Tiii AD Ai;>ruuu5i.

ABOUT THIS TIME ANNE ilia FALLS A
LITTLE FLAT.

DUTCH MBITLB— Funatul
over again, Anne Mie has a friend in Neeltjf.. an elderly, vixenish
spinster, between whose age and that of Anne Mie any mere spectator,
coming in late and ignorant of the piece, would find it rather diffi-
cult to discriminate. In the Second Act, when Anne Mie is supposed
to be eighteen years older, time baa moved but slightly with her,
and scarcely at all with Neellje.
Then when Mr. BRUCE, who hasn't been killed, turns up again, no
one feels any more interest in him and his attachment to Anne Mie
than they would in the haphazard appearance on the scene of a middle
aged commercial .traveller of gentlemanly exterior, and bearing a
distant resemblance to the lineaments of the great Duke of WEL-
LINGTON. But as he does not attempt to trade on this peculiarity,
the spectator merely notices it as a remarkable feature in Mr. BHUCE s
performance, and nothing more.
The fact is, the hero and heroine—the light-comedy young English
Engineer and the arch Dutchess, as represented at the Princt
of Wales's—are a hopelesnly uninteresting couple. Not so, Mr
KoBKmsON. as Koeunnid Deel, the lover of Lisa, played by Mist
tiii.uiAM with inuuh feel-
in g and fur too much
vuice—which is Mr. Ro-
BKRTSON'S fault also • so
much so, that in the Love
Scene where both want to
meet as quietly as possible,
and not attract the atten-
tion of Anne Mie, who is
writing in the next room
with the door open, they,
with an artfulness pecu-
liar to double - Dutch
people, shout at each other
at the top of their voices,
md bawl sweet words of
love in one another's ears
as though they were merely two accidental visitors spending a
pleasant half-hour io an Asylum for Deaf Patients.
Mr. FLOCKTON—as the wicked Dutch Orphan, the perpetual burden
of whose plaint is
"0 if I had some one to love me!"
—is very good, that is, as the conventional melodramatic villain who
goes about hating everybody until overtaken by poetic justice, which
in thiri takes the very mild shape of simply getting himself kicked out
of a Dutch pothouse by an Uncivil Engineer.
If Mr. FKRNANDEZ he intendad to represent an old Dutch farmer
who in happier and earlier days has served his apprenticeship to a
costermonger with a donkey-cart in Whitechapel, and still retains,
in his old age, a smack of the chick-a-leary slouch and tone of voice,
then the highest praise is due to this artist for his admirable repre-
sentation of a most difficult character. But if, on the other hand,
this is not the idea intended to be conveyed, then he is a comparative
failure.
Under certain conditions Anne Mie may yet flourish, but with those
conditions the present Star of Tottenham Court Road would find it
rather difficult to comply.
On Chrunnnhotimthnlugot at the Gaiety Matinee, and the new
afterpiece at the Royalty, fairly adverlUed as an Eastern Extrava-
ganza, and now most unfairly described as a Burlesque, we, shall
have something serious to say next week.
BRUTES BEWARE 1
"Omnibus drivers and cabmen will find it useful to take note of the fact
that Metropolitan Magistrates hare now resolved to make life rather unplea-
sant for persons who maltreat beaiti of burden."—Standard.
Ii's very well each Magistrate of London town proposes,
To make the lives of cruel men no longer beds of roses.
Whoe'er ill-treats his horses now, they 've made an understanding
Shall have no option of a fine, no gentle reprimanding.
Such things have been of no effect, the cruel-hearted driver
For paying, say a tiny fine, has never oared a stiver.
He's given the money with a grin, and never felt remorse
The while he lashed with cruel thong the ever-patient horse.
The animals work night and day o'er flint and stones and grayel,
And scores of them are very lame and quite unfit, to travel;
And under cover of the uigbt the drivers, as we know,
Put hapless creatures in the shafts with marks of many a blow.
But now the Magistrates have said such monsters, without fail,
Shall not be punished with a fine, but straightway go to gaol;
And there they may reflect in peace, through all the weary day,
That cruelty to animals does not exactly pay!

DOMESTIC ECONOMY.
How to Build a House,—Put
yourself unreservedly in the hands
of an architect. Let him lavish
all his art on the exterior of the
house, producing an artistic effect
for passers-by and the people
over the way. Never object to
light and air being shut out of
rooms by columns, projections, or
the want of windows.
How to Let a House,—Look it
np and put a bill in the window
saying that the key is left at a
certain Agent's. Select an Agent
who lives as far away as possible
from the premises. If yon can
get one who seldom answers let-
ters, who is seldom at home, and
who lives in a place that nobody
ever heard of, so much the better.
When the housa is advertised,
carefully exclude all information
about rent, taxes, rates, number
of rooms, &o.
How to Burn down a House.—
Stop the gas supply, and use can-
dles in all the rooms. Have paper
shades over the candles, and leave
these shades to tumble into the
wicks in the drawing-room, while
you are having a prolonged dinner
in the dining-room.
Another Way.—Use mineral oil
in lamps that are placed upon
tables easily upset.
ME. RTJSKEN intends completing
his Fort Clamgera. He is con-
templating a series to be called,

SIR WILLIAM VERNON HARECAUQHT.
AFTEB SETTLING A VERY OLD OFFENDER, HE HAS HIS EYE ON THE
JUVENILES.
ADVICE TO PLAYGOERS.
THE proceedings of the Church
and Stage Guild are a relief to
the monotony of existence. Life
is worth living to read the ac-
counts of their meetings. They
have all the propriety of the
Church, and are far more amusing
than the Stage. Last week the
Rev. Mr. PONSONBY read a Paper
on the duties of playgoers who
find themselves witnessing a bad
play. He had no strong opinions
to enforce, and did not counsel
violence. He was not sure
whether an audience ought to
hiss, or go round in a body to the
Manager. He did not hint that
they should ask for their money
back, tear up the benches, or call
for the Author, and pelt him. He
rather suggested a policy of pa-
tience and forbearance. Our
advice to playgoers in this po-
sition is more definite than the
Rev. Mr. PONSONBY'S. When
thev witness a bad play, let them
go home immediately, and write
a better one.

APPROPRIATE place for the resi-
dence of tenants who won't pay

CONSIDERATIONS OF A CAULIFLOWER.
WHAT a funny world it is—to a
humorist I I'm a humorist. Perhaps
you wouldn't think so to look at me,
unless you're a person of unusual
penetration. If one doesn't qaper like
a Clown, or grin like a joskin, one is
set down by idiots, as dull. Most
people think me as grave as a Chancel-
lor's wig. Young TUHNIPTOP, who is a
wag—I nate wags, they 've no sense of
humour—calls me a Melon-Cauliflower,
and thinks himself awfully funny.
More like a Melancholy Jaques. He
wasn't a horse-collar man, and I 'in not
a horse-collar-flower. Ohl a real
humorist can pun, as well as mere
wags, when they care to stoop to it.
TUBJITPTOP says my puns "lack
finish." I'll ''finish" him before
I 'ye done with him. Humph I Some-
thing equivocal there! But never
mind.
.in D a JLUUU; nui LU, j. oaj. Here am I now, tucked up under the
fustian-clad arm of a bawling Coster, and being hawked round a small
and sordid suburb. A fine creature like me, and of so good a family
too I Why, bless you, CAULI CIBBBE and Lord MACAULT—the names
have suffered corruption—were only—but there, it does not become
a humorist to vaunt his lineage. Only those pretentious Brooolis
are parvenus and impostors, that I will protest. They dare to claim
kindred with me on the strength—or weakness—of the most distant
resemblance in name and family physiognomy. Preposterous! Why
they 're sold by the pound, a degradation to which, thanks to our
superior size and splendour, we 've never been reduced. No, we have
always been monetarily individualised—to put it simply—though
when the tariff cornea to be—in the words—(semi-articulate howls
rather)—of the horrid hawker, "sixershillinoollyflowaiV!" there is,
in sooth, but little left to boast of.

ItVs a funny world/I say.
We used to be credited with the superiority which is our native
possession. But these are democratic days, and even the haughty
Asparagus is sold by the quarter-bundle, on door-steps, to dowdy
women with bombazine dresses and blatant babes. Fancy being
chaffered for by a City clerk's wife, or appearing, with smoky
melted-butter, at a small shopkeeper's Sabbath board I Is it not a
funny world?
Prices rule low to-day, but I suppose suburban "screws" rule
lower,_ for I don't get disposed of. The Coster is hoarse, his arm is
hot, hiis fustian malodorous. In these dirty democratic days, sense—
all the senses—as well as spirit, are subject to indignity and disgust.
Engh! I always so shrank from anything common and cheap.
"Cauliflower Collywobbles" young TUENIPTOP calls this superior
sensibility — "a bad imitation of aristocratic bumptiousness."
TURNIPTOP is low—lamentably low. On the best terms with the
proletariat, he 'd as soon serve a shoeblack as an Alderman. As he
himself rhythmically puts it—he's absurdly proud of his Catnach
doggerel :—
Since destiny me baa decided to dish up,
What matter if 'tis to a Bargee or Bishop?
Wags haven't the descrimination of a Colley dog's tail, much less
of a Cauliflower's head. It's very, very funny. If TTTKNIPTOP only
knew what an idiot he is! Well, then, of course, my superior sense
of humour would lose the subtle delight attending perception of his
unconscious imbecility. There are compensations. It is a funny
world, and the funniest things in it are asses unaware of their ears.
This last, by the way, was TTTRUTPTOP'S own expression—epigram
he called it—and the drollest part of the business was he didn't see
its reflex application. Meant it as a hit at me .'.'.' Ha! Ha! Ha 1
Yes, it u a consolation to be a humorist, even in a world of donkeys
and democrats.
Hillo! a halt I Bawling Brute stops bawling, and begins "a
deal." It is too much, a deal" too much (as TTJBNIPTOP would
say). And with a Sweep, of all Men I Horror! I am transferred
to his sooty paws, my snowy bosom is desecrated by his dirty digits.
I rage! vain is the wrath of a poor choler flower—I mean Cauli-
flower. "Tuppence " changes hands. My doom is sealed. Cutoff
in the Cauliflower—pshaw! the flower of my youth and humour. I
go—I go—to Pot 1

(Ballad by a British Farmer.)
"NEW TBST FOE TRICHINA.—A Holstein peasant, uninstructed in
microscopical research, and not possessing tin: requisite instruments of pre-
cision, has devised for himself a new test for the presence of trichina in pork.
When he killed a pig he was careful to Bend a portion of it—a ham or a
sausage—to his pastor, and then waited the consequences for fourteen days.
If his pastor remained healthy, then he felt perfectly easy in his mind, and
well assured that his pig fulfilled the requisite conditions of soundness of
food, and he proceeded to dispose of it accordingly in his own family. This
ingenious method of research has not been considered satisfactory by the
district physician."—British Medical Journal.
Up out there in Hulstein—you knows where I manes—

And the chief of his substance depends upon swine.

Cause as how they don't skip, creep, or craal on their hides:
Bred in pigs' flesh and innards there they nestles, and bides.
'Tis a spacious o" worms what be mostly so small
As the bare eye wun't sarve fur to spy um at all.
They be finer nor hairs, and the pigs by that means,

When a Christian on pork, ham, or bacon as feeds,
Tucks um down wi a's Tittles, inzide un they breeds;

That there Holstoner farms in a small sart o' way,

But the day that a do so his mind's all agog
As to whether there's any trikeens in the hog.

So now fur a moral to tag to my song;
If you always dooz right you wun't never do wrong;
When you purohuses pigs, mind o' what breed they be:
You be oaashus of all barn o' sows beyond sea.
Don't trust none what comes over from outlandish parts;
But stick fast to the hogs of the old English sarts;

be placed on the Four Pedestals at Blackfriara Bridge. The Designs may be
submitted either by Drawings or Models. If by Drawings, to be either in
Chalk, Charcoal, Pencil, Ink, or Sepia. If by Models, in Clay, Plaster, or
other convenient material. The Designs in either case to be prepared to a

the Committee, viz.: Two of £2oOf.; two of £150; and two of £100. These
Premiums will be given for Models only, &c., &c.
He has done several in Chalk, which he may possibly exhibit at
Chalk Farm, at whose Dairy he has a considerable chalk scored up.
No douht if his proud spirit will submit to competition, he will win
by Chalks. He has also done some in Charcoal; and we hereby warn
him that if these frescoes be not removed from the passage of our
Office, where they are obstructing everybody, they will be at once
carted off to the coal-hole. We nave the deepest respect for Art,
but to the coal-hule they will be consigned, and respect can't go
much deeper than that. The Committee who award the Premiums
will make the draft payable to ns direct, and we '11 see the Artist

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
LORD MA UK'S DAT.
LAST Toos-
day was Lord
Mare's Day!
I can scarsly
rite the words
without imo-
shun. The
grate red let-
ter day in our
Cullender, as
1 heerd the
GildallBeedle
say. Every
good Citizen
was on tip-
tow, in his
dressing-
pownd and
slippers, to
see what sort
of morning
was abreak-
ing before
brakefastin;
and when
they seed it
was pretty
good for the
time of year, they, no doubt, all sung Nong Nobis, like we do for a
good dinner.
As I alwis hear sumeboddy say, for more than 700 years, beginning
with Lord Mare ALL-WINK,—not a bad name for a Lord Mare,—has
this sollum day been dewoted to Lord Mares, and Sheriffs, and Gills,
and Men in Armer, and tho the thoughtless may snear, all loyal and
constitooshunnle mines will bow down on their bended nees and bless
the 9th of November, which curus to tell is only 4 days after Gi Fox
Day I What a proverdenshal thing it is they warn't on the same
day I How the ribble Gester would have rejoiced. Let it ever be
remembered to Gi Fox's honnur, that he urrid on his little job so
as to git it over before the 9th.
I was speshally fortnit this year. I was at Gildall to see after
the brakefast, so I saw the sho start. I saw the gracef ull way in
which the Coachman, and the postilliun, and the 6 grums, and about
a duzzen Perlicemen tugged and dragged the State Carridge and 6
bosses up to the dore at Gildall, without one of the bosses tumbing
down, or even the Carridge bumping against the posteses more than
3 or 4 times.
As I gazed with reverunse on the wnndnfull and butiful machine,
a fine sample, I was told, of the Eye Art of the Middling Ages, the
one thort that ,wade upon my mine, heavier than Xmas puddin,
was, would it go through the Tempul Bar Testimonial, or would it
stick on the Refuge for the Destitoot in front of it.
From the lots of Fire Engines and hundreds of Firemen in the
percession. the ignerant Foringer would ha' thought that West-
minster All was atire, and the grate LOR MARE was agoin in state to
put it out.
I asked BROWN how they ilected which Compennies should go with
'em, and he told me at once, for he seems to know everythink. They
has the Patten Makers beoos the LORD MAEE is considered a Patten
to all the world. They has the Lorreners' mistry because nobody
ever yet discovered what on earth a Lorrener means. They has the
Stationers because the Copperation, like the Company, wants to be
stationery. They has the Salters for fear of any Assalts, and they
of course has the Speckticcle Makers because the LORD MAKE always
wears 'em.
I wos in the Libery, to see the presuntashuns, and didn't some of
my Patruns look lovely in their Deppity Lef tenants' red coats and
reel sords, almost like reel soiers, only those stoopid sords wood get
stickin between their legs ana neerly upsettin them. All the Com-
mittee with long sticx in their hands, and bootiful ornyments hung

and got in every boddy's way, and purwented us seein anythink,
so we wished 'em all a jolly ways off, sticx and all.

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
OUB old friends EVELYN and PEPYS would have been delighted
with the specimens of Diaries which Messrs. J. J. SMITH, SON & Co.
have issued for 1881. Had we as many lives as a oat, we_ should find
in this lot which have been forwarded to our Office a special diary for
every one of them. The little pocket-books are evidently moat useful;
and the prices, like the books themselves, are adapted to all pockets.
To any modern BOSWELL who has a Dr. JOHNSON in view, these
note-books are invaluable.
The Rebecca Rioters, published by MAcMnfAN, is well worth
reading. The Rioters went for all the barriers in their neighbour-
hood, and ultimately, as it was a real grievance, the obnoxious ob-
etructions were legally abolished. The authorities at the Mudtord
Estate Office will probably consider this a too dangerous chapter in a
History of the Bar to be studied by the residents about the Gordon
and Tavistock Square and Gower Street districts. By the way, the
notices on his Grace of MUDFOBD'S barriers are instructive reading

Euston Square, and has half-an-hour to spare. "Oh, Reform it

NOTES ON THE NINTH.
(The Lord Mayor's Banquet at Guildhall.)
THE Two Graces—one before and one after the Banquet—were not
given by choristers. The Chaplain" begged a blessing" (as Mr.
Stiggins was requested to do on a certain celebrated occasion), and
returned thanks. This method was not so effective as the pious
harmony of ancient times.
The LORD MAYOR, on proposing the Foreign Ambassadors, didn't
risk the pronunciation of M. CHALLEMEL LABOUR'S name. Mr.
HARKKU, the Toast-master, risked it, came out with something
sounding like " Shallaballa," and then disappeared for a minute or
so behind the Lord Mayor's chair.
Mr. GLADSTONE personated a Naval Demonstration by appearing
in an Admiral's Uniform. He wore epaulettes—but his shoulders
are broad enough to bear anything. It is believed that he was a
little disappointed at not being called upon for a hornpipe. If occa-
sionally at sea towards the end of his speech with regard to the
Eastern Question, yet it is probable that his nautical costume sug-
gested his commenting on Lord SELBORNE'S speech about " Law and
Liberty," after the style of Captain Cuttle, and informing his audience
that "the point of these here observations lies in the application on
'em "—to the present Irish difficulty.
After the PREMIER had acted 'as telegraph-boy—not the Daily,
but Postal—and delivered a polite message from the SULTAN to the
LORD MAYOR, the general impression was that the Porte had made
a present of Duloigno to our present Eastern Potentate King MAC-
ARTHUR. But what will he do with it? Turn Turk, eat Turkle Soup,
marry Green Fat-ima, and make all the Common Councillors wear
turbans P No, that would create too great a din-turbans in the City.
Still a very effective speech might be made on 'Change beginning,
"Hereditary Turkish Bondsmen, know ye not," &o., &c.
The distinctive feature of the Banquet was the braying of the
trumpets before every important toast. There were many present
who, nad they been permitted to be their own trumpeters, would
have brayed just as loudly, if not so well.
Those unaccustomed to the ways of the Guildhall Banquet fixed
their eyes on a rostrum, expecting to see the Chaplain step up there
and say grace or read a homily. They were agreeably disappointed
as the Chief Carver ascended this pulpit, and had a Lord Chief Baron
of Beef placed before him on the reading desk, which was soon
ornamented with some very fine specimens of genuine old English
carving.
It was remarkable how the' LORD MAYOR accentuated—Irish-accen-
tuated—every point in his speeches, which were, on the whole, of
commendable brevity; but after the Star of the Evening—Beautiful
Star—had twinkled, we thought it best to strike the light luoifer,
and, taking comfort in the weed which cheers but does not inebriate,
to wend our way home humming "Hey down Derry," and success
to MACA.BTHUR.
The New Motto.
"LAW and Liberty " is a free or liberal translation of " Imperium
et Libertas." The necessity for coercion in Ireland must be "proved
to demonstration," says the PREMIER. What sort of demonstration
this time? A Military Demonstration? If so, let us hope that it
will be followed by something more valuable than the " Cession of
Dulcigno," i.e., by the "Session of 1881,"—or even by an extra-
ordinary Session of 1880—to redress real Irish grievances and satis-
factorily answer our Western Question.

THE GRIFFIN'S LAMENT.
As sung by the Fleet Street Selkirk.

—
I AM Monarch of naught I survey;
E'en my site is a theme for diapute:
Erery omnibus horse that I see,
As he passes me, says, " What a hrute!"
Talk of dignity P What are its charms,
When, thrust in the popular face,
I fill the whole street with alarms,
Looking down from this horrible place 1
I 'm out of humanity's reach,
Stuck up here on the summit alone;
And as for the music of speech,
All I get is a hiss or a groan!
For no beast of the plain, old or new,
No brute from the depths of the sea,
No bird that you '11 find at the Zoo-
Has the vaguest resemblance to me!
No wonder I can't inspire love!—
Why, at dusk I 'm the cause of such dread,
That, had I the wings of a dove,
I'd make for the Duke of York's head.
Up there, I my grief might assuage,
And at least limit critical truth
To such chaff as might come from the cage,
In the shape of the sallies of youth!
But, alas! spite rebuke and report,
And letters, and threats, by the score,
I 've been fixed! And henceforth, without sport,
I shall hear my name mentioned no more!
My friends in the City, do they
Send a wish or a thought after me P
I trust that they do; for this way
Not a friend but old BIRCH shall I see!
So the traffic each night sinks to rest;
The barrister turns to his square:
The bustle all hurries due West,
Yet still I sit here in the air!
And if you could then see my face,
You 'd say, "He has had it so hot,—
Has that brute, that he knows his disgrace,
And admits he's a precious bad lot T"

is at length about to concede the rights of Woman. They
have been acknowledged by the Elective Branch of the Manx Legis-
lature^ The House of Keys has amended its Election Act by the
extension of the franchise to all women of full ape not labouring
under legal disqualification. In so doing the Manx House of Keys
has opened its doors to Man's better half.
The other Assembly of the Legislature of Man may be confidently
expected _to confirm the decision of the Elective Branch, and prove
itself, as it were a House of Lords, no lesi disposed and determined
to do justice to the Ladies. The experiment of Female Suffrage,
successfully tried in Man, must shortly cause that manly example
to be followed by the Imperial Parliament, and then the electoral
influence of the Gentler Sex will advantageously serve to counteract
that exerted by the Boughs.
A PHILISTINE.
TAKE away all your adornments cesthetical,
Plates of blue china and bits of sage green,
Though you may call me a monster heretical,
I can't consider them fit to be seen.
Etchings and paintings I loathe and abominate,
Grimly I smile at the name of BDHNE JONES,
Hating his pictures where big chins predominate—
Over lean figures with angular bones.
Buy me what grinning stage rustics call "farniture,"
Such as was used by our fathers of old;
Take away all your nonsensical garniture,
Tapestry curtains and borders of gold.
Give me the ancient and solid mahogany,
Mine be the board that will need no repairs;
Don't let me see, as I sit at my grog, any
Chippendale tables or Sheraton chairs.
Hang up a vivid vermilion wall-paper,
Covered with roses of gorgeous hue,
Matching a varnished and beautiful hall-paper,
Looking like marble so polished and new.
Carpets should all show a floral variety,
Wreaths intermingling of yellow and red';
So, when it enters my home, will Society
Say, here's a house whence {esthetics "have fled.
Academicians at Play.
AT the Fishnumgers' Banquet Mr. HOBSLEY, R.A., expressed a
hope that the Rich City Companies would turn their attention to
Mural Decoration, and wisely mixing a little business with plenty of
pleasure, he suggested that he himself was not altogether inexperi-
enced in this department of Art. Evidently he had his eye on some
particular wall—without being wall-eyed—and perhaps is eager to
purchase spaces and start as a rival to Mr. WtLliNO, whose works
Mr. HOHSLET must consider "willinous." Mr. LESLIE, R.A., who
evidently didn't take the same view of the stroke of business to be
done, replied that the " City Companies had no idea of going to the
wall," which was rather hard on his brother Academician, who won't
be able to get any of the City Companies' hoardings to cover the
expenses of nis wall. But the idea is good, all the same.
Here's a "Little-go"!
[The propowl that French or German should be substituted for a classical
anguage in the Previous Examination, was rejected amid loud cheers in the
Cambridge Senate House, NOT. 11, by a majority of 40.]

Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Yes; and G-SCH-N to be made a Member of the Imperial

moving from Herat till next spring—kind compliments, Sfc." Also a telegram
from Commander-in-Chief of the Basutos. As it's written in Basuto, rather
hard to make out; but he says in effect that we "needn't be alarmed about
the War. everything going on satisfactorily, some of Cape recruits rather raw,
but he likes them raw;" and ends with "best wishes for our continuance in
office." Most flattering.
All. Exceedingly gratifying to our feelings.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. I thought you 'd sayso. Bless you all I Now, must really
think about work for next Session. What shall we start off with—Eastern
Question, Bankruptcy Bill, County Franchise, Land Bill,—which shall it be?
Sir W-ll-m H-rc-rt. Talking of the Land Bill somehow or other reminds
one of Juvenile Offenders. I don't know why it should, but it does
Sir Ch-rl-s D-lke. Bother Juvenile Offenders I I believe you 've got 'em on
the brain. How about the Senile Offender, on the Bosphorns, eh?
Mr. F-rst-r. Yes, and the Green-Isle Offenders all over Ireland P I had a
precious narrow squeak of it coming over—dynamite laid on lines—several
internal machines on board steamer to Holyhead—Fenians blazing away into
carriages! No joke, I can tell you.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne (cheerfully). Well, here you are, at all
events. Now, suppose we have a little talk about Foreign
Policy?
Earl Gr-nv-lle. I was going to mention that I 've got
a capital notion. You '11 say so when you hear it. All
European Powers to form Joint-Stock Company for
liquidation of affairs of Porte by arrangement and com-
position! Just think of the splendid dividend we shall
get! I ought, perhaps, to add that I 'ra indebted for
this excellent business idea to a young and rising member
of the Ministry.
All. Capital! Exquisite! And the dividend?
Earl Gr-nv-lle. That 'a the best of it. Turkey, of
course, don't you see? To be divided among the share-
holders in proportion to the number of their Ironclads
and the amount of their enthusiasm.
All. First-rate! Let's propose it to B-SH-BCK.
[Boy tent off to telegraph to B-BM-BCK.
Mr. F-rst-r. Now that we 've knocked off the Eastern
difficulty, let's tackle Ireland. The thing to do is to
satisfy demands of tenants without infringing rights of
landlords; to introduce law and order into disturbed
districts, and at same time to convert starving labourers
into happy peasants of an Hibernian Arcadia. That's
my plan.
All. Capital! How are you going to do it?
Mr. F-rst-r. How! Oh, that's a mere matter of
detail. I leave that to you.
Lord S-lb-rne. If you leave it to me, I should say,
"Coerce the whole lot of 'em."
Mr. Ch-mb-rl-n. Just so. Coerce Irish Landlords.
Drive 'em out, "bag and baggage."
Lord Jf-rt-ngt-n. Hml You forget I am an Irish
Landlord. (Awkward pause.) Can't we suspend Habeas

for it out of some of that money GR-NT-LLE 's going to
get out of SULTAN. Coercion a great mistake.
Lord H-rt-ngt-n. Talking of stakes, I never thought
that Robert the Devil
Mr. F-rst-r. Well, well, let's talk about him after-
wards. So, we're all agreed about Ireland. Now,
suppose, for a change, we pass on to India?
Lord H-rt-ngt-n. Thought you 'd come to that sooner
or later. • I 've got splendid notion. Candahar to be put
up to public auction — AMEEE and AYOOB bid against
each other, city knocked down to highest bidder, and
there you are! Or, at least, of course you aren't there,
because you 've got safe back into India. Then with the
money we can buy one or two Big Maps—sure to come in
useful—or reduce Income-tax, or something. I may
mention that this capital business plan is entirely due to
the fertile brain of a young and rising member of the
Administration. It wouldn't have occurred to me
Mr. Sr-ght. Talking of the Kurds, what shall we do
about these outrages? Here they are, you know, out-
raging, murdering, crucifying I Every bitj as .bad as
Bulgaria—eh, GLADSTONE?
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. A place and a time for everything, my
dear JOHN. "Atrocities" are an exceedingly important
electoral foot—or rather pre-electoral fact. Now comes
the interesting question—" WHERE is THE FLEET?"
[All get out their maps, and look for it. Soy sent to
telegraph to Sir B. 8., asking where on earth he's
got to. No answer being received, the Council
shortly afterwards broke up, Lord H-BT-NOT-S-

chances of Petronel for the Liverpool Cup.
Mr. GL-DST-NE when last seen was presenting

THOUGHTS BY A SITTER.
No. II.
EKSONAIXY fond of animals,
especially oats, I had the
privilege of being brought
up in my boyhood with a
magnificent specimen of a
female Persian. Anything
softer than her fur, more
luxuriant than her tail, or
gentler than her manners, it
is impossible to imagine;
but her misfortune was that
she was too attractive.
It waa my mission, when
not engaged in the compara-
tively humble vocation I
then pursued in the City, to
keep my eye upon Medurah.
Weapons were not per-
mitted me: my revered re-
lative was so fond of cats
that she forbade even the
wanton wanderers of the
night to be treated with
severity. Mjr office was to open the front-door very wide, and say
"Shoo I" or in serious cases to make that peculiar clatter with one's
hand and one's hat which, I verily believe, no animal, from the lion
downwards, can hear without abject terror. My patience, however,
was at times a good deal tried; and on one fatal night, having been
already roused by three distinct and different cats—each with a
distinct and different serenade—and getting up with fury and im-
patience to turn out a fourth. I took up the poker, struck wildly at
the intruder, and killed Medorah!
I draw a veil over the mental agonies with which this mischance
consumed me. I had esteemed the deceased very highly, but my
Grandmother loved her to distraction; she would, I felt, never
forgive the cause (however innocent) of her favourite's death; and
she had twenty thousand pounds at her own disposal!
I have said that Medorah was a fine specimen of her race. But
the phrase " as large as life " did not apply at all to her; for, when
stiff and cold, the poor dear creature became about twice the size she
had been when alive and kicking.
I put her into an old fish-basket in which a Severn salmon had
arrived—it was not an inappropriate coffin, for she loved salmon,—
and, having sewed it up with a needle and packthread, placed it on
the top of my bed as a temporary measure. It would be safe there,
I knew, iu the search that was sure to follow, till I had made up my
mind what to do with it.
I went to the City next morning in a state of mind easier to
imagine than describe, leaving my Grandmother almost out of her
mind.
"If I knew the darling was dead, JOHN," she cried, "I believe I
could bear it; but to think of her being lost—and—and exposed to
temptation!
And there the Old Lady fairly broke down under the weight of
her calamity.
Perhaps she could have borne it better BO; but the question for
my consideration was, if I had told her the sad truth, would she
have borne me f My impression was, and is, that I should have
become abhorrent to her, and that she would have left that twenty
thousand pounds of hers away from her natural belongings to a
Cat Hospital.
All that day at the office I involuntarily defrauded my employers
by thinking what I should do with that dead body. To a question of
a fellow Clerk, relating to an important female client. I answered at
random "Drown her! Burn her!" And when asked for some-
body's name, that of one of the chief Clerks of the Probate Office, I
answered " Medorah."
When I got home I found my Grandmother had been offering
rewards per handbill for her favourite's recovery, and that with the
same object she had communicated with the Police. All this made
my position more critical, and the disposal of Jtfedorah's remains
more difficult. Where teas I to put them?
We had no back garden, not even a back yard. I thought of
sitting up till the rest of the household had retired, and burying my
victim under the hearthstone of the back kitchen. There were
fearful precedents for this course. We were a long way from the
river, and, as to carrying poor dear Medorah's body for miles in an
omnibus—no . , . .
To keep it on the premises, and especially over my head all night
was, however, impossible. When my Grandmother had retired (in
tears) to her own apartment, I took the salmon basket with its con-
tents and left the house.
It was a summer night, but sufficiently dark to suit my purpose,
which was to drop it unobserved in some secluded spot. I knew of
a terrace, retired, but fashionable, at a moderate distance, which I
had made up my mind should be Medorah's cemetery, that is, pro
tern. I was well aware that somebody would soon appropriate the
salmon-basket, imagining, perhaps (from analogy and the associa-
tion of ideas) that it held a salmon; after which, "What to do with
Medorah," would be a question for his consideration.
Walking quickly along like a fishmonger's young man, or some
youth connected with the Parcels Delivery Company, and whistling
carelessly whenever I passed a policeman, I arrived at my desti-
nation. The terrace, which had neither shop nor public-house
in it, was utterly deserted. Without pausing for a moment, and as
carelessly as if it had been the end of a cigar, I dropped my basket
on the pavement, and hurried round the corner.
It will be imagined, doubtless, that I hurried home; but I did
not. A terrible fascination compelled me to remain with my head
projected into the Terrace, to see what would become of Medorah.
Two minutes, three minutes, and then there was a female step. A
middle-aged woman, looking like a small lodging-house keeper, was
approaching me by the way I had come. Suddenly she saw the
basket, and stopped. I saw her give a hasty glance around her, to
make sure nobody was looking, and then stoop down. The basket
had vanished. The middle-aged woman had grown a little stouter
—bulged a little on one side as though she had something the matter
with her hip-joint—and that was all. The next moment, however,
she uttered a shriek—a passionate appeal for pardon. A man of the
artisan class, whom her conscience had, no doubt, for the moment
represented as a policeman, seized her by the arm. I walked round
the corner, like a young gentleman taking an evening stroll, and
inquired of the struggling pair what was the matter.
"This man wants to steal my property!" exclaimed the woman
in quavering tones.
'' Her property !" cried the other, disdainfully. "Why, I see her
lift it from the pavement with my own eyes! It's my property,
Sir. I just stepped in to call at Number Seven, and left it outside,
and here this wicked woman comes by, and collars it."
"I think you had better let him have it," said I, judicially.
The woman muttered something about men always siding with
men against the.weaker sex, and walked off as if nothing had hap-
pened.
The man walked on also, but in the other direction, and with the
air of an injured person. His innocent mind was doubtless picturing

NOBLESSE OBLIGE.
THE Duke of BEsTirrNSTER has come to the relief of the Duke of
MUDFOBD. He has planted a Kiosk in the midst of Mud-Salad
Market. A Kiosk used to be spelt Kiosque, but that is of small im-
portance. A Kiosk is a Sentimental Eating-House with a very bad
name—a Cook-shop where they really cook—a Coffee-shop where
they really sell coffee. It is intended for market-men, poor people,
and economical people. The latter cannot complain of a place where
they can get a dinner consisting of soup, fish, and entree for sixpence.
We have all our exits and our entrees, and one man in hig time eats
many tarts, but our entrfes are not always twopence, and we do not
always get a slice of bread and jam for a halfpenny. A clean, large,
well-arranged Restau-Kiosk-que-rant, where soup is twopence, half
a pint of good coffee, tea, or cocoa is a penny, a plate of beef is three-
pence, a rasher of good bacon is twopence, a bottle of soda-water is a
penny, and hosts of other things in proportion; which is open from
two o'clock in the early morning till half-past twelve o'clock at night,
which has beds and baths, a penny lavatory, provides chess and
draughts, and the newspapers at half-past five in the morning, and
which is lighted up with the electric light, is a place for the Duke of
MUDFORD to look at and copy. The beds and baths might be a little
cheaper, and there is a little disproportion between the rasher of
bacon and the rasher of ham, but take it altogether, the Bow Street
Kiosk is a thing for the Duke of BKSTMINSTER and his colleagues to
be proud of. If they would only enlarge their labours, and form a
Mud-Salad Market Improvement Company, there would be some
hope for Central London.

. „.*,.,.Uwijv*ui^,j i>,jn in course amost successful burlesque
in its day. It is a genuine burlesque, because it burlesques a serious
original. Without this there is no raison d'etre for burlesque. A
burlesque should caricature a particular piece, or the mannerisms
and affectations of a school. CARET had this latter object in view
when he wrote Chrononhotonthologos, and was probably stigmatised
as a profane trifler by the theatrical big-wigs of his time, who, had
they dared to pun, might have called him the Don't-Carey, and
prophesied a bad end to such a profane
scoffer. Burlesque has its own proper
sphere in Art, and its legitimate exer-
cise should produce a most salutary
effect. Chrononhotonthologos is in-
tended to satirise the grandiose and
drama of its day. The
stilted style of blank verse
no doubt suggested to Mr.
JOHN HOLLINGSHEAD the
appropriate introduction of
the troupe of eccentric
gymnasts, the tallest of
whom touches the sky-
borders. Such a burlesque
as this requires serious
playing: and, as in the
Critic, the humour at once
disappears directly the
Actors attempt to be funny
Mr. SODTAR as Rigdum-
funnidos, Mr. MUBBAT, al
first, as the King, and Mrs
LEIGH as the Queen, enterec
into the true spirit of th
piece. Mr. SQUIRE (wh
is admirable as If. Mey-
nard in the Corsicar
Brothers, Limited), soon
discovered that his efforts
at forcing fun threw a
T. . damper over the audience,
it is the fashion nowadays in some quarters to decry burlesque
and it by burlesque such objectors understand the all-leg-and-no-
head pieces, which simply depend on song, dance, dress, and deport-
ment, then we are inclined to agree with them—only they must not
so misuse the word " burlesque." For example, Don Juan at the
Royalty, which forgetful of the brilliant Strand days, styles itself
the ancestral home of
burlesque," is not a bur-
lesque at all—it is an ex-
travaganza, and as such
was at first correctly
advertised. To say of it
that it is the greatest
success since Black Eye'd
Seeusan is to place it in a
category to which it does
not properly belong. A
[JALLio-like critic may
personally care for none of
:hese things, and stigmatise
;hem all under the general
lead of trash or absurdity,
>nt as a professional dra-
natic critic he should dis-
inguish between extrava-
ganza and burlesque. Don
Juan, as a modern speci-
men of the kind of enter-
ainment which was in
'Ogue "consuls Planche,"
is light, bright,'and, from BARROW-METRICAL DEPRESSION, OR

ng to those whom Providence has blessed with affluence and good
digestion. This extravaganza might sing of itself—
"I am such a plotless thing,"
with perfect truth. It is said to be written by the Brothers PREN-
DKKGA8T. What the brothers were at all "aghast" at, is not evident.
if it be true that the collaborateurs are Messrs. RIGHTON and
IBECB, then we are sure that there must have been some good
teece-on for his writin' with RIGHTON, as the Right-hon-ourable

changes of scene on such a small stage are a real triumph of inge-
nuity. Our gifted Artist who went to take the costumes seems to
have thought that there was
very little to take. He has
reproduced the pretty faces
and what appeared to him to
be the best lines in the piece.
In extravaganzas of course
we must expect the charac-
ters to go any lengths—ex-
cept in costume.
The dresses here are far
better than those in L'Arbre
de Noil at the Porte St.
Martin, which is about as
dingily mounted and as
weak a fairy-piece as it has
ever been our misfortune
to witness. MILKER, one of
the best actors of character-
parts, whose performance of
the miser Gaspard in Let
Cloches de Cornet-Hie was worthy of ROBSON in his best days, plays
a role utterly unworthy of his talents, which are quite thrown away
on such trash as L'Arbre de Noel. Madame ZtJLMAH-BouFFAR sang
"The Two Obadiahs," in English; this and a dance of about sixty
Notaries were the funniest hits in the piece.
We went over to see Michel Strogoff, but found that, having been
postponed, it was
Michel Strucli-off
the bill till the fol-
lowing Wednes-
day. It's out by
now; but when
there's a "depres-

there are howling

Channel, we prefer
to be one of those
gentlemen who live
at home at ease,
and who do not
much trouble
themselves about
the danger of the
seas when the
stormy winds do
blow-ow-ow.
We had the pleasure of seeing Les Grands Enfants at the Vaude-
ville. It is composed of old materials craftily worked up, and its
success is entirely due to the wit of its dialogue and the admirable
acting. Of course it took two authors to write it, Messrs. GONDI-
WET and MARGALIEBB; but that trash, the L'Arbre de Noel, took
Pour of 'em, and, if ever broth was spoiled by too many cooks, there
is the specimen.
At the Vaudeville, Madame LESAGE, Messrs. DIEUDONNE and
ERNEST Vois are

AT a meeting of the Commission of the General Assembly of the
Free Kirk recently held in Edinburgh:—
"The Moderator was authoriied to sign petitions against any measures
brought forward in Parliament for opening Museums, Art Galleries, and
Libraries on Sundays."
So much for the attitude of the Free Kirk of Scotland towards the
freedom of everybody in the United Kingdom not of its own per-
suasion with regard to Sunday; but if this is the light shed on the
subject by a Moderator, the sooner Scotland gets some new Lamps
for the old ones the better for everybody's rational enjoyment on the
Saubbawth. To visit Museums and Art Galleries on Sunday is at
least an improvement on tippling whiskey, seeing double, and turning
the Saubbawth into a Saw-both Day.

in the time of the Barmecides. (Query—Who were the Barme-
cides? Were they Egyptian barmaids? Look it up in HAYDN
some day. Anyhow, nothing like poetry to end up with.)
CHAPTER ONB HUNDRED AND EIGHTIETH—AND LAST.
By the bye, must say something about Literature. Happy
Thought!—Chuck in an extra chapter on Literature 1
The latter half of this century has produced a few first-class
literary geniuses (such as MACAULAY, myself, TENNYSON, and AN-
THONY TBOLLOPE), and no end of second-raters. MACAULAY made
History popular: nobody had done this before. (Who's done il
since ?—give it up ?) FROUDE introduced the Paradoxical school o\
Historians. They don't study to be accurate: they deal more with
persons than with events, and a good deal more with fiction than
with fact: they discover that some great man was all our fancy
never painted nim: in fact, this way of writing history has the
advantage that it is seldom true, but never uninteresting.
Now for Science. HEBSCHEL was a man who, in the words of the
German poet—(which P)—" made eyes of the stars, and had his soul
in the blue ether." (Have I got that quotation right ?—No matter,
on we go.) Then there's DARWIN, of course. His idea not new. Some-
body in one of DIZZY'S novels says that "we were once fishes, and
shall some day become crows." Then there's HUXLEY,—and TYN-
DALL. TYND ALL'S more poetical than HUXLEY—more "coarsely
materialistic" too. How can he be both? (Ask somebody this—but
it doesn't matter, as I 'm making a brilliant 'finish.) HEBBEBT
SPENOEB is DABWIN, HUXLEY, and TYNDALL all in one. And there's
an end of the Evolutionists, thank Heaven!
As to Fiction. THACKERAY, DICKENS, &o., not at all bad. But
do read Donna Quixote—beats 'em hollow. Also Lady Judith.
GEORGE ELIOT tolerable novelist. A. TROLLOPS Al. No time for

MONTE CRAMPTO.
(A Chapter from a recent Election Commission Romance.)
IT was the old town of Veau et Jambon. It was at the time of the
General Election. A Stranger had arrived. It was MONTE CRAMPTO 1
Gaily the party rolled away towards Le Crayon et I'Ardoite, a
hotel which MONTE CRAMPTO, the mysterious stranger, had hired at
enormous expense.
"Why, he has prepared quite a. fete for us!" said the Baronne.
"Behold what a brave show these flags make!"
She was right. Hesitating at no expense when the pleasure of his
guests was concerned, the town of Veau et Jambon was richly deco-
rated with flags by MONTE CBAMPTO.
"Quick! see them!" said L'OuBS NOIB. "Why, one, two-
there are six persons making promenades on the Pier. Such a sight
has ne'er gladdened my eyes before."
"MONTE CBAMPTO," replied the Prince, "does nothing by the
half. All enjoy his bounty. He has thrown the Pier open free.
Hence the crowd you behold."
"And the dead walls of the town," said DE LA BOUCHEBTE, "they
are all gaily hidden. Oh, it is beautiful!"
And so it was, for every available inch of wall-space was covered
with what looked like tapestry, bearing for device—
VOTE FOB MONTE CRAMPTO! VOTE EABLY AKD OFTEN ! I
VOTE FOB MONTE CBAMPTO !! I
The guests did full justice to a sumptuous repast, presided over
by their munificent host, which would have recalled LUCTJLLUS to
their minds had they ever heard of him.
"But you eat not yourself!" said the Baronne.
"My tastes are ascetic," replied MONTE CBAMPTO, with his calm,
cold manner.
"But this ham is uncommon good," said the Prince.
"It is the ham of York. I 'm glad it is good. I care not what I
spend, but I hate to be cheated. That ham costs me seven-and-
sixpenoe the pound."
"This beefsteak-pie is superb, Count MONTE CBAMPTO."
"A mere bagatelle. Fifteen guineas they charged me for it."
"So crisp, so sweet, so fresh is this celery, that you must try it."
"A poor, humble vegetable," replied MONTE CBAMPTO, still calm
and cold, "half a sovereign a stick.
"I enjoyed the beer"
"At three shillings the glass, beer, I believe, ought to be good."
"but this gin is very magnificent."
"I am happy," said MONTE CBAMPTO, still calm and cold, "they
but ask me twenty or thirty-five shillings the bottle."
"And you know not." asked LEM TKES HEUREUX POSTILLONS,
"what it precisely stands you in?"
"Bah!" replied MONTE CBAMPTO, "when one spends thirty, or
forty, or fifty thousand a year, one is not apt to think of trifles.

A CENT-PEE-8ENSIBLE SUGGESTION.
THE following letter is understood to be on its way from Constan-

Stamboul.
The SULTAH presents his compliments to Prince VON BISMABCK,
and regrets to note that His Excellency is embarrassed by the
presence of certain members of an ancient race within the dominions
of His Imperial and Royal Majesty the Emperor King. The
SULTAN, in continuance of the enlightened policy of his august
predecessors, has striven to the utmost to oblige the whole of Europe.
From the benevolence of his heart His Majesty would now assist His
Excellency. The SULTAN and his subjects have no sort of objection
to Israelites; they scarcely understand the meaning of the word
Judenhasi. He thinks the Christian hass just as big a don-
key as the Jndenhass. The Sublime Porte is too civilised, too
business-like, to feel any prejudice about a question of race. Un-
der these circumstances His Majesty with all his heart invites
the Hebrews resident in Germany to leave Prussia and to take up
their abode in His Majesty's dominions. They will certainly be
allowed to partake in the financial arrangements of the country, and
will be encouraged to enter upon commercial transactions of vast
proportions. Such an arrangement will doubtless be most satisfactory
to Prince VON BISMABCK. It will also be very agreeable to His
Majesty. The SULTAN has no sort of objection to the Jews. On
the contrary, he feelt that he cannot get on wilhnut them!

He dared speak of shame and a noble profession.
A Bishop looks after our souls, but how odd is
The sneer that's implied at the ourers of bodies.
For surely it would be no hard task to fish up,
A hundred brave Doctors as good as the Bishop.

THERE came to our shores a poor exile dejected,
Who saw in the distance his country depart;
He had buried in France all the faith he respected,
And the love of a patriot died in his heart.
"I have come here," he said, "just to warn, not to win you,
To point to the rooks and the breakers ahead;
Be true, in these days, to the light that is in you—
There '11 be darkness in England when Liberty's dead 1
"When Governments call us to stand and deliver,
In highwayman fashion, denying all right
Of property, conscience, of gift and of giver,
When custom is nought, and might only is right;
When the will of a father or mother is doubted
To teach what they choose to the boys they have bred;
When possession is scorned, and when justice is scouted,

The men who have given brave blood for their land—
To turn away Peace from her olive, and carry
A Communist cry with an arrogant hand?
When they banish the friends of the sick and the dying',
And call back base women of crimes in their stead;
When subjects are slaves, and society sighing
For honour!—Don't ask me, ' Is Liberty dead?'
"They dug at the roots that MONTALEMBEBT planted,
When Liberal France was fraternal as well,
The landmarks are gone that our history granted,
Of safety our tyrants have sounded the knell.
They bind us with seals of the laws they have broken,
And pistols of policy hold at our head;
The pen may not publish the words they have spoken,
But the sword is the token that Liberty's dead 1
"It is freedom of action, most truly, to banish
The men who would die for their freedom of thought;
But where are their Radical creeds P—well, they vanish.
And whence the Republican spirit ?—it's bought.
When the men, without blame, are denied contemplation,
And the women are cursed who our starving have fed,
Then, I say, that a crime has disfigured the nation
That scatters the victims of Liberty dead!
"I have come a poor exile, a friend, not a stranger,
For England is near me—America far.
Here hunted from home I am out of all danger;
I 'm weary of stripes and have followed the star.
And it still shines in England—be true to its warning,
Be firm in the faith for which Englishmen bled.
Night settles on France; hut your land is the morning,
Where Liberty lives and where Tyranny's dead 1"

By JESTIN' MACHEARTY.
CHAPTER ONE.
1837.—" A Jove principium." (Mem.—Always bring in quotations where
possible, especially Latin ones: shows one knows Latin. How about a few
Greek ditto? Must really buy a Greek Grammar.) On the decease of King
WILLIAM THE FOURTH, the youthful Princess VICTORIA ascended the throne.
She had been excellently brought up, and was a most admirable and accom-
plished young lady. (Query — does this sound too patronising ?) At her
very first Council, this juvenile Sovereign of an Empire on which the sun never
sets—(Query—hackneyed?)—behaved with an extraordinary degree of self-
possession. Everybody, of course, stared at her: Lord MELBOURNE got on s
chair, with an opera-glass, and stared through that, until WELLINGTON pulled
him down by the coat-tails. WELLINGTON was heard to remark, "MELBOURNE
has no manners." MELBOURNE was not a great Statesman. MELBOURNE was
not a strong man. MELBOURNE was not the sort of man to "make good grow
where it wasn't growing before,"—to quote a great writer, whose name I 've
forgotten. (Mem.—" Great writer" saves bother of looking him up.) And so
much for Lord MELBOURNE.
CHAPTER Two.
Now for 1838.—Nothing important. Why not talk a little about Steam? ]
will. Trains are a wonderful invention—people go much faster than they usec
to. STEPHENSON invented training. ARTEMUS WARD tells a most amusing stori
of a Red Indian who tried to lassoo a locomotive. The locomotive didn t sto]
till it got to the next Station—nor did the lied Indian. This story conclusive}:
proves the value of the invention of Steam. (Mem. for myself—always bring in
entertaining anecdotes where possible. Think this one entertaining.)
CHAPTER THREE.
Next few years taken up with Chartism, China, and
~abul. Lord ELLENBOROUQH and Dr. BRYDON chief
igures in troubles at latter place. Lord E. was showy.
ie had a good deal of the quack about him. So much for
x>rd ELLENBOHOUGH. (Polished him off—hurroo!) Then
came the "Repeal Year"—so called because nothing
was repealed. (But it will be—you trust PASNELL and
me!—Mustn't print this.)

">• On the death of PEEL, PALMERSTON was the most pro-
minent English Statesman. His light way of treating
lerious topics very distressing. (To me? Not a bit!) He
mew a good deal about foreign politics, was disliked by
"oreign statesmen, had a quarrel with the Crown, and
was immortalised by Punch as the "Judicious Bottle-
lolder." So much for PAM. As to the Crimean War,
'. may as well polish that off by saying that it was very
damaging to our military reputation, and not a success
K)litioally.

»lead the House of Commons. His mantle fell on a rising
Foung Statesman —(teas he young at this time V Mem.
'or my self—look it up)—Mr. GLADSTONE. (May as well
polish W. E. G. off while I 'm about it—here goes!) Mr.
JLADSTONE had a great deal of earnestness, though not
so much tact as Lord PALMERSTON. He led the House,
while DISRAELI led the Opposition. DISRAELI has been
called a political gladiator—(don't know why, but sounds
well)—so he was! Mr. GLADSTONE has been said to talk
in italics—(what on earth does this mean ?—never mind)
—so he did 1 And so much for GLADSTONE and DISRAELI.
This was to be a reforming Administration. Rumour
gave Mr. BRIGHT India, Mr. MILL the Board of Trade.
Very kind of Rumour. Talking of BRIGHT, may as well
x>lish him off now. Mr. BRIGHT was not a Statesman,
ilr. BRIGHT was not a man of profound and varied culture,
tfr. BRIGHT was not a good many other things that he
might with advantage lave been. But he was a fluent
debater, and a strong Radical. And so much for Mr. BRIGHT.
All this was the " Reform" time. (Anybody desirous
of further details can easily get 'em from HAYDN'S Dic-
tionary of Dates, or other reference book. N.B.—Capital
work, HAYDN'S! HAYDN'S Dictionary for facts, MACAU-
LAY'S Essays for style, and there's your History of Our
Own Times,—or, rather, MY History of Our Own Times,
of course.)
When RUSSELL brought in his Reform Bill in 1866,
GLADSTONE stumped the country in its favour. (Mem.—
Colloquial style—ensures popularity, and covers a multi-
tude of troublesome details.) DISRAELI made fun of it;
LOWE was its chief opponent. He was the Achilles (Greek
character) of the Anti-Reformers. This was his hour of
triumph. He had, it is true, an awkward and ungainly
presence; his voice was hard and rasping; his sight was
very short, and his memory far from long. Where was he
compared with the silver trumpet of W. E. G.'s oratory,
or with Mr. BRIGHT'S mingled pathos and bathos—I mean
humour? Nowhere at all. On dear, no!
VOLUME IV.
Bother this Reform business I Not done with it yet.
To cut it short, DERBY and DIZZY brought in a Reform
Bill in 1867— (vide HAYDN as before)—of a strongly
Radical type. !l They found the Whigs bathing, and ran
away with their clothes." (Query—Who said this?
Don t know. Sounds racy. Let it stand !)
In 1803 Mr. GLADSTONE rose to introduce his Irish
Church Resolutions. As GLADSTONE rose, DERBY and
DIZZY fell.
Then came 1868—1874, six fat years; 1874—1880, six
lean ditto. And that brings me, thank Heaven 1 to end
of my History. Must first polish off late and present
Lord DERBY, however. Father all fire, Son all ice.

As to recent politics, I know all about 'em, and so does
everybody else. Tories say, " Can we be so insane as to

as to support Turkey?" There's the last four years in
a nut-shell; and so ends my History, the four volumes
of which have "perished like snow," long, long ago,

BILLINGSGATE BILLINGSGATED.
LOWEB Thames Street is a narrow passage at the side of the Thames, about
broad enough for a wheelbarrow. It is called Lower Thames Street, it being
almost impossible for the Corporation to sink lower, or for the street to be in a
lower condition. It is guarded at one end by an old fortress called the Tower,
where big guns, some Beefeaters, and a small army are kept to repel any foreign
invasion. The guns and the army might be sent where they are more
wanted, as no foreigner in his senses would invade Lower Thames Street, or
come willingly within a mile of it. If the delicate odour did not kill him,
it would drive him away as a warning to other invaders. This pervading
perfume—which outspoken people inclined to "Billingsgate" would term
"stench"—comes principally from a crowded fish-market, called Billingsgate,
which has been re-built at great expense by the Corporation, when it ought to
have been removed, and partly from the unsavoury proceedings of the Thames
Street fishmongers. As usual with all London Markets, the highway and the
neighbouring streets [are seized by the marketers, and flooded with filthy
slime from scores of dripping fish-carts. Rotten fish and anatomical parts of
fish are deposited freely in the gutters, but though the Thames flows within
a few yards and there are plenty of appliances, the art of flushing appears to be
comparatively unknown to the natives. Attempts have been made by private
individuals to lessen this evil by starting rival and more favourably placed
markets, but the founder of Hungerford Market did not succeed, and the
advisers of a certain charitable Lady spent £250,000 in a set of cloisters at
BethnaT.Green, which could not be created a fish-market by simply calling them
a market. A calculation has been made that more wine is drunk at the City
feasts in the course of the year than water is used by the Corporation to cleanse
Lower Thames Street, and yet the inhabitants of Billingsgate have coolly asked
the Metropolitan Board of Works to request the Corporation to make new
thoroughfares into this charming retreat. They want half the City pulled down
so that the public may come freely into the dirt, when they ought to sweep up
their muck, and gojwith clean hands to the public.

THE CLOUD.
(After Shelley—only from another point of view.)
I BKINO the rain again and again,
From the seas and rivers,
And I pour it down on the deluged town
Till it reeks and shivers.
From my skirts are shaken th/e floods that waken
Poor Cits with the morning light;
I shower my best till they go to rest,
And I keep up the game all night.
By the bucket and pail, like a watery flail,
I lash the wet world under
With occasional spurts of hail (which hurts)
And frequent claps of thunder.
My pall of grey from day to day
Hangs over the dripping lands,
And from hour to hour of the night I pour
Unceasing as Time's own sands.
The dreamer waking hears windows shaking,
Whipped by my lashing flood,
It splashes and sputters from spouts and gutters,
And churns the poor earth into mud.
When the morning breaks the world awakes
To another day of drench,
And the walls all reek, and the roofs all leak,
And the drains all distribute their stench;
And noses red, with colds in the head
From perpetual damp, abound,
And every throat from the bnttoned-up coat
Emitteth a bronchial sound.
Wheresoever you go it is blow, blow, blow I
With complaints of rheumatic pain,
And I all the while in the dark sky smile,
Whilst the world seems dissolving in rain.
The dainty maiden, with tennis-bat laden,
In vain prepares for sport:
For with heavy wet I have soaked the net,
And utterly swamped the Court.
Sunbeam-proof, I hang like a roof
O'er the sadden cricket-ground,
Keeping all things damp as a dripping lamp
All the summer season round,
Until most mankind goes half out of its mind,
And the damp earth seems half drowned.
I am the daughter of smoke and water,
The child of a cheerless sky;
All, save ducks and pumps, must be down in the
dumps
In a world that is never dry!
For after the rain, when my victims fain
Would believe in sign set fair;"
And ginghams are furled, and waterproofs hurled
Into corners, anywhere.
I silently laugh at my own cruel chaff;
And deriding man's hopes so vain,
From a sky all gloom, to an earth like a tomb,
/ come down a drencher again.'

THE Horse-Guards are going a-head. The other day
they taught half a troop of cavalry the importance of
knowing how to move about twenty-four hours without
provisions. They have now shown energy in another
direction. The distinguishing badges are to be removed

Army. As this trifling improvement will put about
£80.000 into somebody's pocket, the policy that prompted
it, though dashing, can scarcely be said to involve "neck

flying about their cage as happy

MY LITTLE BROWN MAKE.
A Song for the commencement of the Hunting Season.
SHE 's rather too lean but her head's a large size,
And she hasn't the average number of eyes:
Her hind legs are not what you 'd call a good pair,
And she's broken both knees, has my little brown mare.
You can find some amusement in counting each rib,
And she bites when she's hungry like mad at her crib;
When viewed from behind she seems all on the square,
She's quite a Freemason—my little brown mare.
Her paces are rather too fast, I suppose,
For she often comes down on her fine Roman nose,
And the way she takes fences makes hunting men stare,
For she backs through the gaps does my little brown mare.
She has curbs on her hocks and no hair on her knees;
She has splints and has spavins wherever you please;
Her neck, like a vulture's, is horribly bare,
But still she's a beauty, my little brown mare.
She owns an aversion to windmills and ricks.
When passing a waggon she lies down and kicks;
And the clothes of her groom she '11 persistently tear-
But still she's no vice has my little brown mare.
When turned down to grass she oft strays out of bounds;
She always was famous for snapping at hounds;
And even the baby has learnt to beware
The too playful bite of my little brown mare.
She prances like mad and she jumps like a flea,
And her waltz to a brass band is something to see:
No circus had ever a horse, I declare,
That could go through the hoops like my little brown mare.
I mount her but seldom—in fact, to be plain,
Like the Frenchman, when hunting I <f do not remain:"
Since I 've only one neck it would hardly be fair
To risk it in riding my little brown mare 1
GOING IT-BY DEGREES.
FEOM a circular advocating the admission of Women to Bachelors'
degrees, which has been sent round to members of the University,
we extract the following :—
"So much having been done—«'. e., for the higher education of Women
and by the London University having thrown open its Degrees to female
BtudenU—' What more is needed ?'.... An essential element of the older
University system ia wanting—that of the requirement of residence. Tlie
Cambridge Higher Local Examination is well adapted to encourage women of
limited resources to use such opportunities of study a> they may possess; but
if regarded as a provision for the sisters of our Undergraduates, it i» obviously
defective."
Cambridge lodging-house keepers had better advertise their
apartments to let in the Matrimonial News. But wherever they do
advertise they could give particulars as to the eligibility of the
Undergraduates who happen to be "keeping" in the same house.
If the Ladies (bless 'em!) once come into residence, will there be any
Degrees at all except for the pale students, who, like the good Saint
Anthony of old, fixed his eyes on his old brown book, and wouldn't
be distracted from his work by the greatest—ahem!—Beauty of
'em all.
The only Degree List that will then be generally interesting will
be the List of Prohibited Degrees which includes some Cousins and
all the Aunts and Grandmothers. If Degrees are to be granted to
the Spindle as well as the Spear side, let the former be Spinsters of
Arts, and the latter remain Bachelors—if they can. We must give
this important subject our further consideration; but if we sign the
requisition, the moment it comes into operation off we go into resi-
dence at Trin. Coll., Cam., as it suddenly occurs to us we have not
yet taken our M.A. "Woa,M.A..!" Ahem! How pretty the capa
and gowns will be. The Head of the Undergraduatesses will, of
course, be a blooming Cancellaria. Delightful f

and sent him to Newgate to take his trial.

SABDOTT. WEEDER.
JAMES BILLING'S reply, not this time heard at Sow Street, but
inserted as an unpaid advertisement in the leading Journal.
Sir,—I never heard of SARDOTT, or a dramatic work bearing my
title. The drama is not adapted from, but founded on the Lady's
novel. What I intend to do with the profits of this play must
always remain a question of sentiment between dramatic authors
and novelists.

[NOVEMBER 27, 1880.
PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHAEIVARI.

ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
Windtor Caitlt.
ON my arrival at "Windsor, I learned that it was necessary to
obtain an order. An Order I Which ?—of the Garter or the Bath?
If so, where was the Lord Chamberlain with the decorations? As
I was about to make this inquiry, I was informed by an obliging
Porter that " I could get all I wanted from Mr. COLLIER."
I discovered Mr. COLLIER to be a bookseller. I entered his shop
with a certain awe, and submitted my request in a tone denoting
extreme humility. I wanted to go over the Castle. Mr. COLLIER
(or his representative) eyed me sharply, as if he would gaze through
my _ul8ter coat into my very heart to discover whether I were a
Nihilist, and asked me for my name and address. Mr. COLLIER (or
his representative) was polite, but stern. I fancy he would have been
better satisfied had I had an heraldic sketch of my coat in one hand,
and my family-tree in the other. But as I had neither with me, my
address card was considered an excellent substitute for both. The
order was handed to me, and I learned that it was Her MAJESTY'S
express command that the ticket
should be delivered gratii, but that
I might buy a Guide-Book.
I approached the Castle, and was
immediately surrounded by a num-
ber of individuals, who had been
lying in wait for me from the time
of my quitting the bookseller's, and
now insisted that they were sure I
wanted a guide. I haughtily repu-
diated the notion, and tried to look
as if I hadn't come with an order,
but was merely going to make a
friendly call. After a while they
reluctantly permitted me to continue
my journey, and I reached a door.
I rang a bell, and was immediately
received by a servant in full Court Livery. I jumped to the conclu-
sion that I had made a mistake in the day, and that the Royal
Family were at home, after all! I was about to leave a card, hope
they were all quite well, and withdraw, when the red-coated,
gold-braided footman respectfully took my name and address as a
preliminary to ushering me into an apartment described by my
Guide-Book as " the Queen's Audience Chamber."
I was bewildered as the thought occurred to me that perhaps I
might be on the eve of receiving knighthood by mistake! A story
of an obscure individual who had actually received the honour in
error, passed through my mind. Had I been accepted by the Eoyal
menial I had just passed, as a Lord Mayor, a successful General, or
a superannuated Civil Servant who had come a little late P Fortu-
nately at this moment other visitors arrived, and I felt that if there
were a mistake I could pass unnoticed in the crowd. My hasty and
unexplained elevation to. the Knightage would not attract atten-
tion until it appeared in the Gazette. The other visitors spoke in
whispers, and looked anxiously towards a door.
Suddenly we were all startled by the arrival of a very dis-
tinguished-looking individual, who emerged from somewhere be-
hind us. He wore morning-dress, and there was a dignity in his
bearing telling of a life-acquaintanceship with the very highest circles
of society. I was so surprised at his unexpected appearance that for
a while I could not oaten a word he was saying. At last I heard him
talking of the Castle in a tone of easy familiarity, which warranted
the conclusion that he must be a distant member of the Royal Family,
a Hereditary Titular Deputy Arch-Duke, or perhaps a Hereditary
Grand Duke of something ending in "itz," who, having some leisure
to spare, was employing it in making himself generally useful and
earning a small salary.
His Serene Highness was fall of information. He gave us, with the
kindest condescension possible, the subjects of the tapestry upon the
walls. Now and then he added the cognomen of the 'painter. On
these occasions His Serene Highness invariably alluded to the work-
man as "an artist of the name of So-and-So.'* I feel certain that if
the Hereditary Titular Deputy Arch-Duke had had occasion to refer
to the talented author of Samlet, and other tragedies and poems,
he would have spoken of him as "a writer of the name of SHAXS-
PEABE." When he had told us something about a person whose title
sounded to me like "MORE DICKEY," (referred to in my Guide-
Book as MORDBCAI), he gracefully waved to us to enter another
room. Then, when we had respectfully withdrawn, he looked all
the doors of the apartment we had quitted with the dignity of a
proprietor of at least fifty years standing. This air of being
"quite at home and very pleased to see you" confirmed my im-
pression that I was in the presence of a very illustrious personage
indeed. It pained ma to notice, however, that sometimes His
Serene Highness misplaced the aspirate, and was a little uncer-
tain about his "quantities." But this was pardonable and piquant

in a foreigner. We entered the Guard Chamber. The Hereditary
Titular Deputy Arch-Duke gave the exact dimensions of the room,
and pointed out two small flags that he said had been presented
to the Queen by the Descendants of the Heroes of Blenheim and
Waterloo. He kindly attracted our attention to one or two other
little objects of a similarly interesting character. Then he looked
round, and noticing a richly-chased
shield, observed that "it had been ex-
hibited at several exhibitions." He
added (I believe as an after-thought)
that it had been made by a foreign
Artist of the name of BENVENTJTO
CELLINI. We now entered the St.
George's, or Grand Banqueting Hall.
His Serene Highness smilingly pointed
to an enormous dining-tame about
Forty yards long. "Some of the leaves
bave been removed," he mentioned
carelessly, from which I inferred that,
many of the members of the Royal
Family being away from Windsor, he
bad found the buffet inconveniently
large, and had ordered it to be
shortened to suit his personal re-
quirements. On passing into the
Grand Reception Room, his Serene Highness was good enough
to give us a version of Jason and the Golden Fleece, which was
illustrated in tapestry on the walls of the apartment. I could only
catch a word here and there, but I believe the Hereditary Titular
Deputy Arch-Duke spoke to the following effect—" There is Jason
charming the Dragon. And there is Creusa, his second wife, putting
on the fatal robe. And there is Medea, who has killed her children
for falling out. Thinking of taking a flight to Athens, she would
throw them at Jason's feet. And there is Jason wanting to kill her,
but stopped by those two men, who, as you see, are restraining him.
After this exhaustive dip into classical lore, we entered several other
apartments. And now our Deputy Arch-Ducal Guide began to unbend
a little. Upon our admission to the Waterloo Chamber, he grew quite
confidential about the domestic arrangements of the very Highest Lady
in the Land. "The QUEEN," he said, "likes this room best for a
dance. You see, she can put the musicians in this gallery; but in
the other room she would nave to build a place for the band if she
used it."_ We all expressed ourselves thoroughly delighted at this
piece of information, and felt (with the Court) quite a nice little
family party. Next we went into a small dark closet, that His
Serene Highness told us was a favourite dining-room of King GEOROE
THE THIRD. Over the mantelpiece of this strange-looking apartment
was a stained glass portrait of that eccentric monarch. "If you look
in this," said His Serene Highness, pointing to a mirror immediately
opposite the painting, "you will see the window reflected in it!"
And, bless us! so it was I
We passed across a hall into another room. The Hereditary
Titular Deputy Arch-Duke grew a little excited. He had ap-
proached the feature of the collection. He paused before a timepiece.
"It only requires winding up once a year!"
he exclaimed, in triumph. "It is the only
clock of the kind toe have got in the Castle!"
In another moment he had vanished, with the
abruptness that had marked his first appear-
ance. We saw him no more!
I stumbled up some stone steps, and found
myself on the top of a tower. A jovial-
looking Military Man was holding forth on
the merits of the view before him. Hoping
that I might be mistaken for an official visitor
to the Castle, I said, languidly, "that I knew
it all," as if I had been accustomed to the
prospect for years.
I chatted on, and felt convinced that the
Military Man believed me to be (at the very
least) a Cabinet Minister in attendance upon
the QUEEN, and staying in the Castle.
"You see those places down below, Sirp" he said. "In years
gone by they used to be used as prisons."
"Yes," I replied, languidly. "Dark, dreary-looking places! And
so they were prisons! By the way, what are they used for now?"
"They are used now, Sir," was the prompt reply, "as bed-rooms
for the guests of Her Majesty I"
To prevent any further mistakes, I returned to Town immediately 1

AT Rochester, the other day, was observed a "Temperance

so totally opposed to the notion, that it at once went down of its
own accord, in order to prophesy a very wet Sunday.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
Lillie Bridge.
Os receipt of an invitation to be present at "GAME'S Great Walk,"
I travelled down, a few days since, to West Brompton. My card of
admission informed me that the feat would be performed by the
pedestrian getting over " 2500 miles in 1000 hours, walking 1.J miles
every half-hour." I was further told that the promenade would
continue "from Saturday, November 20th, 1880, to Saturday,
January 1st, 1881."
Until my visit my impressions of Lillie Bridge had been rather
vague. I had believed that it once had been the head-quarters of a
Club given up to skating on wheels. I had heard it whispered that
the Rink had been changed subsequently into a Gymnasium. I had
seen on the hoardings about Town, just before Easter, large placards
of men wrestling, labelled " Lillie Bridge on Good Friday," and from
this I had gathered that the Club might have extended the scope of
its original objects.
It has been my lot to be present at many depressing spectacles. I
have visited a town immediately after a bombardment, I have seen
convicts at work in a prison conducted on the silent system, I have
passed through the confirmed melancholy ward of a lunatic asylum;
but I never witnessed anything so utterly depressing as the grounds
of Lillie Bridge during the early days of " GALE'S Great Walk."
I presented myself at half-past two on a cold and wet afternoon, a
few days ago. A passage beside a Railway Station led to a deserted
turnstile, over which was placed a placard giving the price of ad-
mission. The label had been altered from some larger sum to six-
pence. As I reached the stile, a youth, who had been walking away,
returned hurriedly, and seemed surprised to find that I desired
admission. However, the exhibition of my card, inscribed " Admit
Representative of Punch—H. B. GKEEN, Manager," obtained ready
recognition, and the lad was good enough to conduct me into the
grounds.
At first I could hardly believe my eyes. I was prepared for a
melancholy sight, but not for solitude. I had fancied that Mr. GALE
would have been surrounded by
enthusiastic admirers and sup-
porters, who would occasionally
break into bursts of loud applause.
I had even thought it possible that
there might be some flags and a
band. The place was quite empty,
with the exception ot two little
men toiling round a heavy sodden
track. One was Mr. GALE, and
the other was his attendant. The
first (in the distance) looked like a
criminal lunatic doing his exercise,
and the last like his keeper.
After learning from the youth
that I was free of the place and
might go where I pleased, I looked
around me. I was standing on a
large piece of uncultivated ground.
There were two tracks—one was
being used for the " Great Walk,"
the other was being slowly flooded
from a running tap of water. On one side were the walls of
Brompton Cemetery; on the other, a number of new taverns
and small dwelling-houses, amidst which towered a workshop that
had' come to grief, and was now in the hands of the auctioneers.
On the north were some ramshackle refreshment-rooms, apparently
closed for the winter; on the south some low building that looked
like a laundry or a Parish Union. The principal features of the
grounds themselves were a small unfinished iron summer-house, and
a swing that seemingly was the forgotten remnant of a long-past
country fair. In a corner were two cannons of ancient make, that
might have belonged to a Volunteer Corps that had left them there
after being disbanded. Near the unfinished iron summer house was
a board recording the number of miles that had been walked by the
limping pedestrian now coming towards me.
"Two!" _was shouted as I stood looking at the dismal scene in the
drizzling rain. It was the only sound I had heard since entering
the grounds, with the exception of the cemetery bell hard-by, which
was tolling every minute in compliment to an approaching funeral.
The Pedestrian, with a peculiar swinging gait, passed on and com-
menced Lap Three. As I stood, note-book in hand, an Official joined
me. He was very civil and full of information. Yes, the Pedes-
trian had to come out every hour and half-hour to do his appointed
distance. He generally took about twenty minutes, which gave him
ten minutes rest. He could not sleep, but he sometimes dozed. I
was not to mind the limp, it was his style, and he had had it during
previous trials of endurance. I might go and talk to him. He was
never tired of chattering. He had the Press to look after him. If I

liked (and this was told me as if a great favour were being conferred
on me) I could come and see him walkinn in the middle of the night.'
The gate was always open, and he would be found doing his work
every hour and half-hour from week's end to week's end.
"You have not many spectators," I observed.
Well, no, they had not. My friend the Official was of opinion that
they (presumably the Public) would not come much before the end.
Then, he gave me to understand, they would flock to see him—if he
only could last out!
"Does he ever have a band?" I asked, fancying that perhaps
music might be an assistance in a " Great Walk."
The Official looked surprised. He evidently thought I was quizzing
him. A band for one man! But finding I was serious, he did his
best to conciliate me.
"Oh, I daresay he will have a band during the last week," he
returned; and then added, as if to confirm the good opinion I cer-
tainly must now entertain of the arrangements, "And Ishouldn't be
surprised if they didn't give him a lot of illuminations I"
By this time the voice I had heard before had called "Three,"
"Four," and lastly, "Finished." Upon this the Pedestrian quitted
the track, and was assisted
up some steps into a large
uncarpeted room surrounded
with lockers. I followed him,
and found two gentlemen
seated at a wooden table.
One was cutting out extracts
from a sporting paper, the
other was dividing the con-
tents of a large dish of boiled
beef, cabbages, and potatoes.
Mr. GALE was assisted to take
a seat on one chair, while his
legs were propped np upon
another. His lower man was
covered with a horse-rug. I
now saw him close, and felt the sincerest pity for him. His face was
thin, and his eyes seemed to be staring out of his head with an ex-
pression of intense weariness. He was wearing a cap closely drawn
over his head, a rough coat, knee-breeches, woollen stockings, and
a pair of heavy boots. These last had holes in them. He appeared
to be a lively fellow enough, and most anxious to afford informa-
tion. He would take beef, but no carrots. He was fond of beef-
tea. He found the track soft now, but during the night it had been
as hard as nails. He had just got through some mouthfuls of food
when a bell sounded. In a moment he was on his feet, and the beef
was discarded. Another bell sounded, and he was out and away once
more with his attendant. The time had already arrived for him to
do another mile and a quarter in the space of halt'-an-hour!
I followed him, and saw him again limping beside the small dwell-
ing-house, the Parish Union, the slowly increasing pool. As he
finished each lap the voice recorded the fact as before. Now he
appeared to me pale, now flushed, but always distressed. And as I
looked at all this I thought why has a card of invitation to witness
this sorry sight been sent to " a representative of Punch?" There
was nothing comic about it, nothing amusing. I did not laugh, and
felt that no true description of the matter could provoke merriment.
I considered that the wretches of Port-
land would shudder at the idea of
changing places with this poor creature.
I knew that were a horse treated as
this man was consenting to be treated,
the Royal Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals would interfere. But
there's no Royal Society, and no power
in the world that can prevent a man
making an ass of himself if he chooses
to do so. But why send a card of ad-
mission to "the representative of
Punch t" Was it because many a
shameful transaction has been crushed
in these pages? Was it because Mr.
Punch for nearly half a century has
been a powerful advocate on the side
of justice? Was it because the pro-
moters of this stupid, cruel, degrading
piece of tomfoolery wished the matter
to be placed in the proper light? Very well, then, Mr. Punch's
Representative has done it. When I was at Lillie Bridge I did
not see a single spectator who looked as if he had paid for admission,
and I earnestly hope that not even "a band and illumination>
during the last week" will attract more visitors. But supposi'i"
this walk kills Mr. GALE, what will be the Coroner's verdict?
His own fault? or whose?
As I left, the voice was crying "Finished" to the appropriate
accompaniment of a tolling bell—in the neighbouring Cemetery!

"FINISHED!"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CHRISTMAS IS COMING!!
A HTORY-skurry on the
staircase! loud cries of
excited people clamouring
for instant audience.
Calm, dignified, serene,
Mr. Punch rose to the
occasion, but before he
could utter a word the
folding-doors were burst
open, and in rushed, pel*
mcle, a crowd of highly
respectable but almost
frenzied individuals with
books under their arms,
books in their hands,
books in their pockets,
books on their heads, while
several turbulent persons
in the rear were wildly
waving illustrations,
games, picture - books,
packets of cards, and voci-
ferating all at once.
"May I ask the cause
of this intrusion Y" in-
quired Mr. Punch with
the utmost composure.
'' Christmas is coming!"
they shouted.
"I am aware of the
fact," replied the .Sage;
"and if my old friend is
on the staircase, I regret
that he will be compelled
to wait till the twenty-
fifth of next month."
"No! no! "they shouted
again. "Look here!
We 've brought"
The Philosopher of
Fleet Street held up his
hand, and commanded
silence. He had recog-
nised some familiar faces.
"I think," he said,
smiling graciously, "I
am addressing my excel-
lent friends, the Pub-
lishers of Christmas
Books for Children"
"You are! You are!"
they cried.
''Also the Publishers
of charming Christmas
Cards"
"Hear! hear!" exclaimed the representatives of several eminent firms, dancing with delight at the recognition.
"And, if I mistake not, I see amongst you Artists and Authors whose works have delighted our dear children—for all children are
Mr. Punch's pets—for many years past?"
"You do! You do!" was the grateful and subdued murmur.
"Then," said Mr. Punch, practically, "let's see what you 've got."
First he warmly congratulated Miss KATE GREEN AW AT on her Birthday Book for Children, with verses for every day in the year,
by Mrs. SALE BARBER. "A most dainty little work," observed the Sage, "and a really happy thought for Christmas." Splashes of Ink
Explained, by Mr. C. J. LILLIE, was then brought under his notice. "Not exactly the aesthetic lily and peacock feather, I am glad to see,"
observed Mr. Punch, pleasantly; "but what capital things for children to imitate with a nice new bright-patterned table-cloth and lota
of ink I What fun!" Turning to Mr. MACMILLAN, he congratulated him on the possession of such a treasure as the Necklace of Princess
Fiorimunda, manufactured by MART DK MORGAN, and magnificently set by Mr. WALTER CRANE. "A real gem," said Mr. Punch. He
smiled pleasantly on Mr. SAMBOURNE'S Sandford and Merton, and shook hands warmly with some old friends of Mr. CUAKLES KEENE'S
called Our People, presented on their re-publication in a collected form by Messrs. BRADBURY AND AGHEW.
Then he examined Mr. EDMUND RovrLKDGT.'s Every Boy's Annual, full of adventures by land and sea, with stories of Hardy Moun-
taineers' Ascents, by Mr. HENRY FRITH, Anecdotes of Sharks, by Lieutenant Low, and riddles, and pictures, and charades, and
games, and "square words," and everything that every boy ought to know, and enough to keep every boy amused for the entire year.
In your Fortune-Telling Hook, " said the Philosopher, "I see a fortune; and as my dancing days are not by any means over, I should
like to join in your Singing Quadrille, with its nursery rhymes set to music, and if I 'sat out' I could delight the children with the
amusing designs of Messrs. STAPLES. CpBBOtrLD, and LONGMTTIB."
Mr. Punch fell back in his chair, as about fifty new books were placed before him. "I shall never get through all these. But
stop," he cried, and he selected one from the lot, "this does take my fancy." In a second he had skimmed through it, and put it by
for further perusal. It was Mrs. LOOKER'S What the BlaclMrd Said, illustrated by R. CALDECOTT.
Then he looked through Pansie's Flour Sin. "A sort of relation to my dear friend Alice in Wonderland I perceive," he observed.
"The finish in Sky Land is very pretty, and not too much over the heads of the young people for whom it was intended. Now then,
what's on the cards 'r" he asked, taking up several packs. It was impossible to award special praise to any set where all were so good.
Toby pronounced Messrs. HILDESHEIMER'S "Dogs to be a real novelty, and Mr. Punch selected the Children's Parties, and the
Little Babies, and the pictures of Snow-Balling and Skating with verses by F. E. WEATHERLY as very seasonable and cold weatherly.
DB LA RUE'S Christmas Cards, done in satin for sending by post to friends abroad, are charmingly executed. The ivory cards issued by
J. WALKER & Co., hand-painted, "are," said Mr. Punch, "simply exquisite." Mr. ROTHE'S cards are specially appropriate where

Mr. LUKS, are elegant in design, and marvellous in execution. The
Sage suggested they should be called affaires de Lttks. At all
events," he added, "I like the luks of "em." The cry was still
"they come," and Mr. Punch's table was strewn with Christmas
leaves.
A chorus of children's voices arose without. They had somehow
heard the news, and were preparing to besiege their old friend in his
own brown study. But on one point he was inflexible.
"You shan't see anything till the proper time," he called out to
them; "and not then if you 're not good."
"We will be so good!" was the answer.
"Bless you, my children!" returned Mr. Punch, paternally.
"You shall take them and be happy—at Christmas!"
The Deputation having thanked Mr. Punch most cordially, were
about to withdraw, when the Sage of Fleet Street intimated that he
had just one request to make.
"Will you kindly inscribe your names," he said, "in the new
Guest-Book provided by Messrs. MABCUS WARD & Co., for ' record-
ing the Visits of Friends.^ It is arranged on a plan for making
notes and observations, which will provide a fund of amusement for

men, the book is in the ante-chamber. Toby, conduct the Deputation
to the dining-room, and see that they are served with the best of
everything. The compliments of the forthcoming Season to you,
Gentlemen!"
"Same to you, Old Boy, and many of 'em!" they shouted with
one voice as they quitted the room and descended the staircase.
"Now." said Mr. Punch to himself, "for a grateful havannah
and half-an-honr's quiet enjoyment over Mr. CALDECOTT'S Three
Jovial Huntsmen to begin with, and his Blackbirds baked in a Pie to
follow."
And as he opened the books his eyes twinkled with delight at the
thoughts of the pleasure in store for all his children of all ages and
all sorts and sizes.
PORK-CORNERS AND PIG-STYES.
"Whene'er I take my walks abroad,
How many pigs I see," &c.
PORE has suddenly become a topic. The Times has devoted a
leader to it, and most of the other papers have treated it as a subject
of importance. It has been served up with sage remarks and jour-
nalistic sauce. Chicago in America, and Wednesbury in Stafford-
shire, England, are responsible for this. In Chicago a firm of
speculators have made more than a million sterling by what is called
a " pork-corner." _In England a pork-corner is generally under-
stood to mean a pig-stye, but in America it means a "ring"—a
combination to forestall the market, and to raise prices by creating
an artificial scarcity. In Wednesbury the pork-corner was a far
more humble matter. The inhabitants wished to live with their
pigs on terms of domestic intimacy, probably without a thought of
cooking, and they held a meeting at the Town-Hall to protest
against the tyrannical action of the Local Government Board in
placing difficulties in the way of realising this happy state of exist-
ence. In America. Dr. WATTS'S poem, as improved by Dr. JOHNSON,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
BOOTHIFUL STAR!
THE best ornament in Mr. GOOCH'S re-decorated Princess's is our
American Cousin, Mr. EDWIN BOOTH, tragedian. Mr. BOOTH is
disappointing as Cardinal Richelieu—only,
he it understood, agreeably disappointing.
His performance is free from vulgar rant,
but it is wanting in light and shade. _ He
evidently saves himself for one great situa-
tion, which brings the house down, and
which should also bring the curtain down,
as, after this, every effort to the end of the
Act is an anti-climax. Mr. BOOTH, with
his admirable stage face, and got up to
represent Cardinal Richelieu, could be like
no other person but his Eminence did ho
not bear a stronglv-marked resemblance
to Mr. CLARENCE HOLT as the American
Detective in New Babylon. Perhaps the
similarity may be suggested _ by the
"goatee, which was as common in France
and England at that period as it is nowa-
days in America. At all events, Mr.
CLARENCE HOLT wore it as typical of the
American, and it just gives Mr. BOOTH''
Cardinal that 'cute

trait of Riche-
HOLT may be like both the Cardinal and
fn manner Mr. BOOTH frequently reminds
P HELPS, only without the growl. He
throughout his stage business, too much
cough and the chuckle. Wore he to
little less, he would not be so liable to
this troublesome affec-
tion of the throat, which
his supply of lozenges
is apparently powerless
to alleviate. Why not
try the "Cough No
More" between the
Acts? (N.B.—This is
not an advertisement.)
With his private box of
sweeties he might be
described as a sucking
Cardinal. No doubt
Mr. BOOTH has care-
fully studied the cos-
tume, but wo are curi-
ous to know what
authority he has for
Richelieu in a yellow
dressing-gown trimmed with fur'(—a robe far more appropriate to
an old beau like Sir Hnrcnnrt Cmirtly in his bedroom, than a
Cardinal in his reception-chamber. This is a
detail, but not unimportant in what is in-
tended for an historical portrait. And while
on details—we are glad to learn that coals
were so plentiful in France at that period,
judging, that is, from the fireplace in the
Cardinal's Palace. There might have been
a log or two thrown on just for appearance
sake, but perhaps all the sticks were otherwise
employed.
Oh, Mr. Goocn! call this "support" a
backing of your friends? Why. with the not
very brilliant exception—but still exception—
of Mr. EDMUND LKATHES as Louis the Thir-
teenth, and, of course, "Honest JOHN" RYDER
as the Monk Joseph, the "support" given to
Mr. BOOTH is of the feeblest possible descrip-
tion. Fortunately for Mr. BOOTH, his strongest
'' support" will come from the English public,
which is thoroughly capable of appreciating
all the finest points of his performance. Mr.
CARTWKIGHT as Adrian de Mauprat treats us
to a sort of " Reminiscences-of-Irving " enter-
tainment, and a peculiar intonation, which if
intended as a specimen of ventriloquism is
not absolutely without merit, but it meant to convey the idea of
earnestness or passion, scarcely achieves its object. Had Miss

GERARD as Julie simply to look pretty she would be a pronounced
success; but, unfortunately, the part requires some little acting,
and though it is only fair to her to say that she does give us as little
as possible, yet that little is not strong. The appearance of Mr.
SWINDURNE, in the double character (according to the bills), of Mr.
REDMUND and Saradas, suggests the
notion of an overfed tenor very much
out of training, and constantly dis-
appointing the public by not indulging
in a Solo. He is described by Richelieu
as " that smileless man,"—(good idea for
a song by Mr. GROSSMITH,—"Jfe was
such a Smileless Man !"—rights reserved,)
—but if Richelieu had been in front he
would soon have corrected that mistaken
impression, as Saradas was perpetu-
ally smiling, and smiling "horribly."
He was murdering with a smile the
whole time; but this, of course, was his
artful way of masking his deep-dyed
villainy.
On Francois (Mr. YOUNG) Richelifu
has to impress that there is "no such
word aa fall,"—a very necessary lesson : —
only what matter the word when we have
the thing itself? as the Frenchman said
of the absence from the English language

of any equivalent for ennui.
Mr. W. YOUNO has an expressive eye: the right being the mor>
expressive of the two, at least, he lets us see more of it than thf
other, which he is constantly closing into a spasmodic " I-know-all-
about-it-and-I'm-up-to-yqu" sort of wink. Perhaps, (this being u
historical play) Francois did wink in this manner.
But what a tawdry fustian theatrical play it is! only re-
deemed from burlesque absurdity
by some fine lines here and there,
and by certain telling situations
which are known as "Actor's
chances." By these alone, but
specially by these last, it has held
possession of the stage, and in
powerful hands it may hold its
own for many years to come.
What a foolish muddle-headed
plot! What utterly farcical and
impossible dialogues between the
Cardinal and his confidant,
Joseph, who are little better than
a couple of mountebanks in eccle-
siastical habits. A warming-pan
might long ago have been in-
troduced with advantage in tht
bedroom scene. Mr. BOOTH wisely
avoids the Bulwer-and-Macready
tradition of thrusting out his head
from between the folding" doors, or from behind a curtain, in the
warming-pan and bedroom scene, and screaming with laughter at
the approach of the conspirators, who, headed by the transpontine
melodramatic ruffian, Huguet, are "heard without." In fact, his
performance throughout errs rather on the side of caution. His
threat scene startles us by its sudden passion, but it docs not strike
us with awe for his priestly dignity, and
the impression is so transient, that on
recovering from our surprise, we feel
angry at having been imposed upon by so
shallow ,a trick as that just practised
ii|ion Saradas by this veteran practical
joker, who can thus trille with the most
sacred subjects.
The bathos of the speech itself is only
equalled by the celebrated anathema in
:he Jackdaw •/ Rheims, which, if given
:>y a powerful tragedian, would tell with
as thrilling effect as docs this "Curse of
Kome " in RiehtKeu. However, these are
tho faults of the play, not of the actor,
who in this scene recognises a dramatic
opportunity big enough to cover a mul- YODNO Aoo-irrs COME-
;itude of absurdities. From what we
uive seen of Mr. BOOTH, we should
imagine that one of his best impersona-
tions will be Si rtuccio in the Fool's Revenge.
At the Criterion, Where is the Cats' has been produced. The
inthor was anonymous until Mr. WYNDHAM, in a burst of candour,
;et the Cat out of the bag, and informed the first-night audi-
ence that it was Mr. ALBERT, who seems to have thought that

Until one whispered. "Diamond Cement,"
Then my grief found vent.

Never had china appeared more dear.
Always the same, Derby my own!
Always the same with your D and Crown.

In the years that are gone.

And I sadly part till ths morning prime.
Ah, my cup, how I nurse you then,
Till I 've to leave you for town at ten.

No less than five leading papers telegraphed full par-

house, in which one combatant used the marble top of a
table, and the other a pair of decanters. The fighters
were said to be Corsicans—not Brothers and Co.—and a
vendetta was expected; but, according to the latest tele-
grams from Onr Own Correspondent, tie affair has ended
in a rather tame duel. If any further intelligence arrives

For I'm going to write you a play, HENRY, I 'm going to write
you a play.
There's lots of blank blank verse, you know, but none so neat as mine;
There's GILBERT, and there's WILLS, and—well, some others in their line,
But none of them are Laureates, though clever in their way;
So I'm going to write you a play, HENRY, I 'm going to write you a play.
'Twill be all right at night, HENRY, on that my name I "11 stake;
I 've got a good Egyptian plot, that's safe, I 'm told, to take.
You're poisoned in a temple, Miss TEBRY dies at bay,—
I am writing you such a play, HENRY, I am writing you such a play.
As I came towards the theatre, whom think ye I should see,
But Messrs. HARK and KENDAL, looking sorrowful at me?
They were thinking of The Falcon I wrote but yesterday,
And they didn't ask me for a play, HENRY, they didn't ask me for a play.
I know your Ghost draws well, HENRY, but don't be in a fright,'
My forte, isn't stage-effect: when I write plays, I write.
Youj'll have five pages at a time,—as much as you can say;
But a Poet is writing your play, HENRY, a Poet is writing your play.
Some critics tell me that my place is not behind the scenes;
That if I must descend I might stop short at magazines.
But as Queen Mary from the doors the money turned away,
You must long for another big play, HENRY, you must long for another big
play.
For fads and fancies grow, HENRY, to wither like the grass,—
The latest, culture ;—and for that, my name doth current pass.
So that's why, though I can't construct, and you feel all astray,
You 've asked me to write you a play, HENRY, you 've asked me to write
you a play.
So take and bill me early, bill me early, HENRY dear;
I 'm going to make the biggest hit of all the coming year;
Of all the coming year, HENUY :—and if it shouldn't pay: —
Still /shall have written your play, HENRY, / shall have written your play!

Hound Hughenden,—for some time past
A Statesman, working day and night,
A nowery fiction did indite—

His hair was dark, and you could trace
A soup fan of an ancient race;
And Btill, in quite his early way,
He wrote of Lords and Ladies gay—
Endymion.
"Tempt not the Press," Lord ROWTON said.
"Of critics have a timely dread:
They skinned yon when you wrote Lothair,"
He answered, with his nose in air,
"Endymion .'"
"Oh stay," the Tory said, "and make
That wicked GLADSTONE writhe and quake."
A twinkle flash'd from out his eye:
"I '11 give him rope," he said, "and try
Endymion!"
"Beware the day they may hegin
To break the Treaty of Berlin I"
This was the Tory's last appeal.
He only said, "I will reveal
Endymion.'"
And so, when Ireland was aflame,
The Eastern Question just the same,
Conservatives beheld with doubt
Their Leader bring his novel out—
Endymion.
And all who waded through the book,

Serene in Curzon Street he lay.

A voice said. ".Now for a cigar!"

THE GAYMARKET AGAIN!
THE make-believe and somewhat unjust prosecutions of one or
two restaurant-keepers in Coventry Street, for "harbouring" the
natural inhabitants of the district, appear to have satisfied the
police authorities and those who put their trust in them. The mock-
modesty of respectability requires some such display as this, at
certain intervals, and gets it. In the meantime the favoured divi-
sion of police who have been kept in possession of this Tom Tiddler's
Ground for several years, are still enjoying their valuable privilege,
much to the disgust of their less fortunate fellows. To smoke
cigars, accept pleasant drinks, hand ladies into cabs and broughams,
and occasionally hold bouquets, is far more agreeable than struggling
with drunken sailors in Ratcliffe Highway, or keeping order in the
turbulent alleys of Drury Lane. Our parochial rulers are doing all
they can to make this Gaymarket district even more desirable.
When the Coventry Street improvements are complete, there will not
be a finer promenade for houseless frivolity in London.

a sort of low-placed pigeon-hole). First single, Vauxhall, if you
please.
\_No response; the solitary servitor within being engaged in a
noisy dispute with a third-class passenger on the other side.

of a mysterious array of empty pots and glasses). Looking for a six-

[Timid Traveller, rushing to gate, encounters another stalwart
Myrmidon engaged in easy converse with a person of horsey
appearance, and intermittently howling forth certain sounds
supposed to be names of Stations.
Timid Traveller (hurriedly). Vauxhall?
Myrmidon (to horsey man—mysteriously). You put your shirt on.

[Chivies Timid Traveller up and down platform, and finally, as
he is plunging into a carriage, pulls him violently back by
his coat-collar, and angrily abuses him, as train glides out of
Station.
Timid Traveller, much depressed, is driven forth from the gates,
like a portly middle-aged Peri with a portmanteau. Seeks
further information of more Myrmidons standing about in atti-
tudes suggestive of lofty indifference, abstracted meditation, or
philosophical observation of human nature in general, and well-
dressed persons with promising game-baskets, in particular. The
latter are the objects always of prompt attention, and often of
deferential pleasantries. In the absence of such, Myrmidons
occupy themselves agreeably in chaffing the News-boys, reading
(gratis) the latest race-returns, shouting smart repartees over the
heads of the crowd, exchanging mysterious and idiomatically -
wonted "tips"; gathering in groups, and talking, with much
loud guffawing, back-bending, and elbow-crooking; and other-
wise demeaning themselves as sporting gentlemen of airy humour
and easy leisure. When a race-train comes in, they are observed
to rush eagerly to their duties, which apparently consist in con-
fidential colloquies with persons having rakish hats and race-
glasses. These official occupations are agreeably varied by lively
altercations with too inquisitive travellers, chuckling chaffing-
matches with ladies of free deportment, and frequent visitations
to those mysterious doors behind which fortuitous pots and glasses
most do congregate. The Timid Traveller, whilst waiting twenty
minutes for the next train, has abundant opportunity of observ-
ing these and other humours of the place. At last, bell sounds,
and gates are filing open once more.
Timid Traveller (at one gate). Vauxhall?
Myrmidon (gruffly). Next gate!
[ Whispers behind his hand to cad in loud " checks.1'
Timid Traveller (at next gate). Vauxhall?
Myrmidon (peevishly). Next gate!

Timid Traveller (at third and last gate). Vauxhall?
Myrmidon (ferociously). No! I tell you Middle Gate. Carnt-
cher 'ear?
[Nearly knocks Timid Traveller over by thrusting the gate in his
face.
Timid Traveller (picking'up his hat). Oh, this is too bad, really!
Myrmidon (at centre gate, to fellow-Sportsman in helmet). Start
at ten to one, I tell you.
Timid Traveller (alarmed). Ten to one? Why, you just now told
me it would start at half-past twelve?
Myrmidon (after five minutes' interval for convulsioni). Yah!
Meant Teddy the Tiler for the Stakes—not the train! In yer go!
Train jest a-start in'! Make a move of it, or you '11 lose it agen, old
Stick-in-the-Mud!
[Timid Traveller hastily takes his seat, shouts from the window
a final inquiry, " Right for Vauxhall T" receives, in reply,
a Stentorian " No!" is gaily whirled on to Clapham Junc-
tion, and finally arrives at his destination in not very much
more than twice the time it would have taken him to reach
it on foot.

SMOKE AND FOG.
THE Committee formed to check
the production of London smoke
and the consequent creation of
London Fog, will do well to turn
their attention, in the first place,
to Pall Mall. If they are under
the impression that many less
aristocratic neighbourhoods have
a greater claim to inspection and
prosecution, they are thoroughly
mistaken. At four o'clock on a
winter's afternoon, when the cook-
ing furnaces of the great Clubs
begin to show signs of activity,
the street of palaces can compete
in soot, gloom, and smoke with
any quarter of Bilston, Oldham,
or Wolverhampton. The great
dinners of the Carlton, the Re-
form, and the Travellers create
as much nuisance as a tin-plate
factory or a dye-works. What
with spongy roads, importunate
crossing-sweepers, loahng cab-
men, night coffee-stalls, and mid-
night prowlers, the inhabitants
of this locality have very little to
be thankful for.
New Brooms.
THE Times informs ns that
the "Brush System" 9f electric
lighting " is to be applied to one
of the dials of the Clock at the
Houses of Parliament." Perhaps
some member may suggest trying
it inside—on the Upper House. A
new brush system might make a
clean sweep of it.

THE MUFFIN-BELL.
THE Marylubone police, who
have evidently given up all search
for the Harley Street murderer,
are now devoting all their un-
employed energy to the extinction
of muffin-bells. A poor muffin-
seller was summoned for unlaw-
fully using a noisy instrument,
to wit, a bell, his defence being
that he had a bad cold, and no
other means of earning a living.
The Magistrate rather defended
him on the score of the antiquity
of muffin-bells, and adjourned
the case. If the police, during
the suspension of their more se-
rious duties, are resolved to run-
a-muok against bells, there is
plenty of work for them to do,
especially on Sundays. There
are dismal, persistent, and mono-
tonous ding-dongs, coming from
chapels of all denominations, that
are enough to drive the impious
mad, and the pious into idiocy.

By the Author of "Loafair," $c.
VOLUME THE FIRST.
CHAPTER ONE.
IT was a warm and rich night in August, when the Right Hon.
WILLIAM GLADSTARS* descended the celebrated eminence of Houns-
ditch Hill. He had hardly got beyond the top of Whitechapel Lane,
when he met the Marquis of FLIBBERTIGIBBET.
"You are the precise person I was wanting to see," said the distin-
guished Statesman, lightly punching that nobleman in the region of
his alimentary canal. The great are always affable.
The Marquis drew himself up. "I have but just returned from
Windsor."
"From Windsor?"
"—And Newton. There's news at Newton—I mean Windsor.
The King has sent for the Duke!"
Now Mr. GLABSTARS was a Tory.t and a firm believer in the Iron
Duke; he could hardly restrain his delight at the intelligence.
After throwing his hat into the air five times, slapping the Marquis
very heartily in the small of the back, and executing a pas teul on
the pavement, he ejaculated—
"The Duke has saved Europe I"
"Europe be blowed!" replied the Marquis, while a wrinkle of
contempt disarranged his Titanic nose, and a frown gathered on his
Olympian brow. "England doesn't want savings, unless in Fossn's
Post Office.^ She wants some one to save England." Then, clutch-
ing GLADSTABS violently by the arm, at the same time foaming
slightly at the mouth, he exclaimed, "It may be my fancy, but I
can't resist the impression,—a change is coming!"
"I should welcome any change," remarked the Privy Councillor.
"that took your hand off my biceps. 'Tis positive torture I endure."
"EndureI" said the Marquis, decidedly; "everything comes to
him who can endure."
• Earl to Editor.—See the joke? They '11 think I mean this for W. E. G.
Bat i/o I! Watch me carefully, and you '11 see—what you will see.
t Same to lame.—Who ia it now, eh P Mixed 'em up already, you see.
j Earl to Editor.—Almost prophetical, they 'II think, won't they? Aha.'
Entre notu, I alipl it in at the last momtnt futt eu it was off to preit.' Good
that, th?
And parting, the two Statesmen pursued their respective courses;
the nobleman wrapped his emblazoned cloak round his Corinthian
form, and dived into the Dead Meat Market, while the Right Hon.
GLABSTARS proceeded on the knife-board of a City 'bus to the office
of the Quarterly Screamer.
CUAFTBB SECOND.
SEMOLINA was the Empress of London, of fashion, and of the Tory
Party. She was always at home to her intimates, so she did not get
much exercise; at this moment she was reclining on a brilliant sofa,
a majestic footstool at her feet, supported by romantic cushions.
In a low chair just in front of her, with bib and pinafore on, and
catching up every word that fell from her lips, sat a Great Personage.
A couple of Bishops and a Cabinet Minister were playing at cat's-
cradle in an alcove; while, more remote, some dames of high degree
were surrounded by cavaliers of ancient lineage, whose every word
was a Jon mot, and every movement a whole volume of Society
etiquette. Servants glided about in muffled skates over the shining
parquet, distributing sherry cobblers and gin cocktails to the visitors,
while at half-minute intervals mysterious and noble-looking strangers
appeared at the door, flew to SEMOLINA'S outstretched palm, im-
printed an impassioned kiss on her jewelled finger, and then suddenly
vanished into air!
"What I want you to see/' said SEMOLINA, "only you're so
incurably obtuse, is that reaction is the law of life, that yon can't
get on without the Temple and the Bar, that the introduction of Gas
will be fatal to the Crown, that Public Opinion is all humbug, that
changes are likely to happen unless things go on as they are, and
that on the Eve of change Adamantine fortitude is imperatively
demanded. I hope you clearly follow me P"
But the Great Personage had fallen fast asleep, and was snoring.
SEMOLINA was disgusted.
"The age of Liberalism has come!" she exclaimed; and kicking
the low chair from under the Great Personage, she bounced out of
the apartment, and slammed the portal behind her.
CHAPTER THREE.
Mr. GLADSTASS was a constant contributor to the Quarterly
Screamer. He was not a heaven-born Minister, but where he came
from is a matter of no importance here. Early initiated into the
mysteries of Eton and Chnstohnreh, he had a fund of Latin quota-

tions, a happy knack of catching the Speaker's eye, and was as
eloquent as ItruxK, and as accurate as SALISBURY. He had married

name is TTBA."
These children are to be my Hero and Heroine! They were excel-
lently behaved young people. When any one spoke to them, they put
out their tongues, shrugged their shoulders, and stared haughtily.
BEN D'YMION had a nice of majestic beauty, and so had TTBA.
He was clad in a blue velvet jacket, with red Spanish filagree
buttons, a shirt of lace, and a waistcoat of yellow damask. TYRA
also wore Spanish filagree buttons. Everything about her was
either Spanish or filagree. Her long ringlets were glittering with
pearl powder.
"What are'you going to be P" asked kind old Lord GOOSEUERKV
of the boy.
"It's like your impudence to ask," replied BEN D'YMION, at this
time about eight years old. "I 'm going to Eton and Christchureh,
and then I shall be Prime Minister, a good deal sooner than you can
say Jack Robinson."
"TYRA," remarked a handsome young Private Secretary,
member you 've promised to many me some day 1"
"Not if I know it," proudly answered the child. "Nobody
under a Dock for yours truly." And the child resumed the cracking
of the walnuts.
CHAPTER FOUR.
SEMOLINA was talking to GLADSTABS.
"I assure you 'tis quite settled. The King won't hear of the
Reform Bill. You're to have Foreign Affairs, and the Duke's
waiting to see you. Cut along!"
That was a wonderful walk for GLADSTARS. He was going to be
in the Cabinet! Only Ministers and Davenport Brothers are in
Cabinets, and both are fettered. He seemed to tread qu air. His
heart almost failed him, but he screwed it up to the sticking-point
with one or two glasses of old bay rum, and appeared in that condi-
tion before the Great Man.
The Duke was easy, affable, pleasant. "He had found it impossible
to form a Government. Could he do anything for Mr. GLADSTAHS?
Would he accept the Under-Secretaryship to the Governor of the
Silly Islands? No? Then he was afraid he could do no more.
Good day!"
Mr. GLADSTARS returned home. This time he didn't tread on air.
On the contrary, he felt he was in very hot water. He let himself in
with a latch-key, went to his study, and blew his brains out. The
operation took some time, the difficulty being to discover where his
brains were.
The Coroner's jury brought in a verdict that " deceased committed
suicide from want of imagination." BEN D'YMION took a junior
clerkship at Somerset House, and TYHA spelt her name with an
"M "—she had the choice of "M or N as the case might be,"—and
became temporary editress of Sfyra's Journal.
CHAPTER FIVB.
VIOIL PILLBOX had fallen in love with TYRA. He was fifteen, and
she was twelve. He was a very High-and-dry-Church boy. He took
her out for walks, and gave her almond-rock.
"You are not high and dry?" he asked, as they were walking
through a valley in a storm.
"No, I feel particularly low and wet," she answered. "Shall
we return?"
"TYRA! I love you I As you are not an Erastian, you shall be
mine!"
"My dear VIOIL, I shan't. I live only for my brother—and my-
self. I intend to be a grande dame. I intend my brother to be
Prime Minister. My creed is, that the Human Will can accomplish
any object it resolutely determines to attain. It's not a very long
creed, nor a very good one; but it '11 do."
And so saying, she got into her perambulator, and VIGIL wheeled
her home.
CHAPTER Six.
AT length TYRA became under-nursemaid in the family of the
JEWCHATELS. This was the richest family in England. Mr. JEW-
CHATEL was a Liberal. Somebody told him the Tory Dukes had
come down handsome for Election expenses. "Have they?" he
replied, "Put me down for double for our expenses. If they come
down hansom, I '11 come down a. four-wheeler." Everybody laughed
heartily at this Jew d'esprit. The pleasantries of the opulent are
always amusing.
TYRA became the bosom friend of LEONORA, the daughter and
heiress of the JEWCHATELS. A constant visitor was Lord LITTLE-
HAHPTON. He was Foreign Minister, and really ruled the country; *
* Editor to Earl.—Who on earth ia this? PALMEKSTON? PEEL?

Earl to Editor.—There is no deception. He looks like PALHERSTON now,
doesn't he? Well, wait a bit!

ENGLISH HISTORY.
"AND WHO WAS THE KINO WHO HAD go MANY WIVES?'
"BLUEBBARD I"
he was old and ugly, but fascinating. Everybody thought he would
marry the heiress. He sometimes thought so himself. A man who
thinks is dangerous.
BEN D'YMION was comfortably settled in a garret in Rateliffe
Highway. It was in this situation that he became acquainted with
the highest of the haute monde. TYRA got ten shillings a week
from the JEWCHATELS, and she gave BEN D'YMION half.
One day the leading tailor in London sent for BEN D'YMION.
His name was PONOO.* When a customer bought a waistcoat of him,
he presented him with a case of Johannisberg and a box of choicest
Havannahs on the spot.
"I like the cut of your jib," he said to BEN D'YMION. "You can
go on tick at this shop to any extent, and pay me back when you 're
a Privy Councillor."
BEN D'YMION murmured his thanks, ordered twenty-five dress-
coats at once, and went to call on Colonel ALBERT, alias Prince
FORSITAN, the disguised and exiled King of the Haphazard Islands.
CHAPTER SEVEN.
Lord LITTLEHAMPTON, though he was a Cabinet Minister, was of
an obliging disposition. As people expected him to marry LEONORA,
he thought he would try.
"LEONORA, do you love me?"
"'Tis my money only you want!" and the maiden blushed a
damson hue.
"Money!" said Lord LITTLEHAMPTON, musing. "There's no
doubt that money makes the Novelist."
"Base and naughty maul" sobbed LEONORA. "Then you do
want my money ; " and she fled in tears from the apartment.
* Earl to Editor.—'Who *» this? POOLS, eh?
Editor to Earl.—Oh, don't ask me! Give it up. He 'a a tailor now, but
heaven knows what he '11 be a chapter ahead!
Earl to Editor.—There you are! That's the fun of the thing. It 'a like
a Pantomime play-bill "POOLE—afterwards HUDSON,"—or," PALHBRSTON
—afterwards CLOWN." Capital notion.
Editor to Earl.—At you like. Fire away!

Then Lord LITTLEHAMPTON determined to try TIKA. Though she
wap forty-five years and three-quarters his junior, he had always
liked her.
"TrRAl Doyottloveme? Will you be mine?"
The penniless dependent was startled.

"Oh, yes, yes," said Lord LrrTLEUAMrioir, "I 've heard you say
that before. The question is, What have you determined on?"
"To get to the top of the tree," said TYRA, "and to take
BEN D'YMION up with me. As I said before, to accomplish that
object, I am even ready to marry you!"
Beautiful and truly feminine creature!" exclaimed Lord
LITTLKHAMPTOJT. "Some people would call this an ambition fit for
an unscrupulous adventurer, not for a modern English maiden. But
/don't think so at all." And folding her to his embroidered waist-
coat in one fond embrace, he leaped into his brougham, lit a cigar,
and thought about the coming Budget.

A SONG FOR THE SEA.SON.
Aia:—"TA» Woodpecker Tapping."
I KNEW by the smoke that so sootily curled
Above the red roof that a chimney was near;
And I said if Asphyxia's found in this world,
The chest that's asthmatic might look for it here.
Not a yard could I see, not a sight met mine eye
But the soot-ilakelets falling like showers from the sky.
Then I said, ".Were such foul-belching chimneys as this—
As they ought to be—made to consume their own smoke,
Even winter in town were comparative bliss.
One could keep clean shirt-collars, nor constantly choke.
Not a yard could I see, not a sight met mine eye
But the soot-llakelcts falling like showers from the sky.
FISHY PROCEEDINGS.
WHILE the Billingsgate fish " ring " are suggesting to the Metro-
politan Board of Works the desirability of pulling down Stinkpot
Alley and widening Hold-your-Nose Corner, for the benefit of them-
selves and Billingsgate Market, it may be as well to suggest to the
Metropolitan Board of Works that Billingsgate Market is a wholly
unnecessary nuisance, and something worse. By wasting the time
of the small distributor, it increases the price 'of an important
article of food, and it helps to destroy as much of this food as would
feed many thousands of starving women and children.
Fifty years ago all the fish came to market by water, and there
was some excuse for a river-side receptacle, however filthy and diffi-
cult to get at; hut now that only a twelfth part of the London
supply arrives by boat, and the other eleven parts by rail, and
chiefly by one or two railroads, it might be wiser for the Market to
go to the Railways, instead of dragging the Railways to the Market.
The Fish-Ring and the Corporation are hardly the persons to initiate
this reform. The first combination helped to strangle Columbia
Market; and the second knows so little about the business, that one
of its Committees takes tolls from the fish-dealers who obstruct the
narrow alleys, while another of its Committees tries to prosecute
these dealers as obstructionists. It will take a good deal of showy
Mansion House philanthropy to wash away the physical and moral
muck of Lowest Thames Street.

LORD BEACONSFIELD'S motto for Endymion is " Quicguid agnnt
homine*" But that's only half. Why not give the whole line,
"Quicquid agunt homines nostri est farrago Rbelli." Didn't the
noble author like the sound of "farrago" and " libelli" f
"Rule, Britannia!"
THE deaths from starvation in London during the last fortnight
have been rather under the average, except amongst the lower orders,
who are not generally honoured with inquests. No case has occurred
to cause any great public scandal. There is nothing like keeping up
appearances.
LONOMANS, TO THE EARL OF B-c-NsF-LD.—" La Propriiti: eit
trots VOLS."
REST.
The Pica, of the London Shop-Oirl.
REST! I suppose there is some such thing
E'en in this our world, though the preacher's text
On Sunday warned us that Hope's tired wing
For final folding must wait the next.
Yet he seemed at ease in his pulpit snug,
And the shining Cits in their padded pews
Must have known rest's meaning, they looked so smug;
Nay, their stabled horses, in well-staU'd mews,
Having borne their burden of fine-clad flesh
From the crowded Church at the sermon's close,
Found e'en man-masters must fain "refresh
A dumb brute's labour with slight reposo.
But I? For a dozen long hours a day,
Six days in seven, to stand, stand, stand,
Till the sore-strained sinews with pain give way,
And the sick heart sinks,—that is Man's demand
Of mere flesh and blood in a Woman's shape,
When that Woman is poor and must toil for life,
The vesture vending that goes to drape
Fate-favoured sisters, or maid or wife.
And to talk of rest to such slaves as I
In the few snatched moments of toil's surcease,
Is like bidding the torturer's victim try
To sleep 'twixt the rack-turns and dream of peace.
I saw him there in the gilded Church,
My Christian master, a shining light.
Philanthropy is the faintly perch
He mounts in public, of conscious right.
I think he champions Slavs—or Turks,
I know he feeds upon platform praise;
Does he ever think of the slave who works
In his hell of shopdom through dreary days?
I am near, a nobody, no one cares
To sing my sufferings, preach my wrongs;
The harried vendors of huckster's wares
Provoke no speeches, inspire no songs.
Too poor, too prosy! And yet, dear Heaven,
How woefully weary poor flesh can be!
Romance's lovers are little given
To seek the tragic in such as we.
But Nature speaks in the lowliest heart,
Though it is not always a lyric cry.
There are many victims in Shoddy's mart;
I have seen them suffer, and pale, and die:
I have seen them take to the road of shaiuo
As a ready, rosy, if short relief
From woman-woes that I may not name.
And petty wrongs that mignt pass belief.
And /—what better am I than they?
What stronger, hopefuller, after all?
Must it come at last, when, some wretched day
Of bitter bondage shall fire the thrall';
When ruthless shop-rules that war with health,
And merciless finings that mock at right,
My little strength and my lesser wealth
Have taxed till patience is put to flight:
When the weary flesh, and the spirit crushed,
And the secret, sore, life-sapping ills,
Sin-fire a fancy that once had blushed
At thought of the refuge that saves—and kills.
Not yet I But if, or—ah, Heaven!—when,—
The pitiless rule and the penal rack
One more have maddened, and Mammon's pen
Strikes through the name of one more slain hack,
Will the wealth-spoil'd women who, seated, wear
My flagging strength with their wanton whims,
The blame of the bondswoman's soul-wreck share?
Will the sleek-faced singers of saintly hymns,
The lynx-eyed traders on girlish toil,
Who urge, and harry, and tax, and test,
Take any stain from the shame and soil
Of an o'er-worked woman who sinned—for rest?

Hungry Visitor (ignorant of the nature of this particular delicacy}. "AH, DUXAI,
WB KEN WBEL HEV THE RAWBIT FOR SAXPEKCB. WE KBN GET TWA
BAWBEES FUB THE SKEBN WHEN WE GET BOCK TO GLASGOW!"
THE LAST STRAW.
(A Chapter from a modern Irish Romance.)
TKE Major gloomily put an arm-chair upon the fire. Then he warmed his
hands at the cheering blaze.
"It is an expensive comfort." he murmured; "but what can we do when
they will not sell us a stick of fire-wood—an ounce of coal?"
His eldest daughter sighed as she noticed that the dining-room was nearly
bare of furniture.
"What matters it!" laughed her father, bitterly. "If we have used up
the dining-room table for fuel, was it not because we have long forgotten the
meaning of dinner? A propos, are we to have any food to-day?"
His daughter burst into tears.
"They will sell us neither meat, fish, nor fowl!" she sobbed out, "and so I
have had to sacrifice the parrot and my pet canary! Oh I cruel! cruel I They
are roasting before the kitchen fire at this very moment!"
"The kitchen fire!" growled the Major, as he thought of his burning
library and gun-cases. Then he added, "Enough of this! You know that
however we may starve our body, we must feed our mind. I will give them
one more trial. Good bye!"
In another moment the Major had put on his iron-sheathed great-coat, and
had entered his fortified gig, and was off to the neighbouring county town.
_ As he disappeared his daughters raised their hands, and wished him " luck"
with voices trembling equally from hunger and emotion. They waited for hours.
At last there was a volley of musketry.
"It is papal" cried the youngest. "I know the sound of the tenants'
rifles."
The fair damsel was right. The Major'entered weary and travel-stained.
Shaking the bullets from his armour-plated coat, he sank upon a chair, and
remained for a few minutes in earnest thought.
"My children," at last he said, "you Know how I have striven to remain
here. You know that I have put up with every indignity. I have tried to
•mile when all my cattle were destroyed, and attempted to laugh off the outrage
as a thoughtless but withal amusing practical joke."
"Indeed, you have, dear father! '* ohorussed his children.
"When our supplies were cut off, I have never complained. I have treated
the heartless conduct of our tradesmen as a bit of unseasonable jocularity. Yes,
even when the messenger from the Co-operative Stores
was skinned alive and the contents of his parcel were
cast to the winds,—even then I have said it is a piece
of fun, and nothing more."
"You have, indeed, dear father!" again repeated his
daughters.
"And when they tried to burn down my house," con-
tinued the Major, with a voice broken with emotion,
"I have said, 'Bhoys (especially Irish bhoys) will be
bhoys,' and have merely tried to put it out. And admit,
dearest ones, it is nut pleasant to be shot at by a hundred
waiting marksmen the moment one puts one's nose outside
one's house? Now, is it?"
"It is not pleasant!" readily admitted his daughters.
"But I thought they would draw the line somewhere.
1 believed that when I went down on my knees and
implored them with all the eloquence of a father and a
man to grant me the boon I craved, they would consent!
But, no, darlings, they are obdurate! I cried—I im-
plored—in your name—in my own—in that of justice,
civilisation, right But, no, they refused me, and I
have come huuie empty-handed! And yet they know
that no one can exist without it! Oh! they are ruthless
— brutal—merciless!"
Some of the sisters were crying, but the eldest was
calm and firm.
"Then, dearest father, we muft go to England," she
said ; "there is no alternative' It would be weakness
—nav, wickedness—to hesitate a moment longer."
"Yes, yes," replied her father, "as they will not
sell it to me here, we must go across the Channel to get
it. It is a necessary of life to us as well as to them.
Without it we shall die I We must go at once—for all
may be sold if we arrive late!"
Within a week the Major and his family were in
England. They were quite happy. Need it be added
that they were now in possession of Mr. Punch'» Pocket-
Book for the coming year?
OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.
LORD BBABOUBNE'S Mountain Sprites is occasionally
amusing. The Illustrations, by ERNST GRISET, are after
the style of GUSTAVE DOKE—only a very long way after.
If names go for anything in Art, M. GRSAsr ought to
come out well in oils—like a Sardine.
A new Edition of The Works of Father Prout, edited
by CHAS. KENT (ROUTLEDGE AND SON). "What say you,
KENT?" Well, what Mr. KENT does say in his Preface is
the most interesting portion of the book. To quote the
Bard again—" 'Tis noble, KENT," and is justly due to the
memory of FRANCIS MAHONEY, of whom it may be
honestly recorded, that, with all his rollicking Irish
humour and classic wit,
"Nothing in his life
Became him like the leaying it."
The Secrets of Stage Conjuring, by the late ROBERT
HOCDIN, edited by Professor HOFFMAN, are no secrets
now. "Every school-boy " knows them, and has tried
them, including the Decapitated Head, which necessi-
tates some carpentering operations on the dining-room
table when the Home-Ruling authorities are well out
of the way.
Apropos. Just wait till we publish OUR Oton Boys'
Own Book! It will be filled with practical directions
for cutting trapdoors in the floors, making Corsican
Brothers' Ghosts' traps down into the cellar, and will
include a lovely play of Guy Fawkes for private per-
formance, showing how to pile up the gunpowder and
the agony, and only omitting the blowing up—which

CHAPTER ONE.
TTRA was trinmphant. Instead of being under-nursemaid at the JEWCHATELS,
she was Lady LITTLKHAMPTON. All the haute monde from Whitechape]L was
at the wedding. The haute monde very obligingly ate ortolans, and pocketed
one or two of the most valuable presents. ,
"'Tis a great coup," said ST. SNOBB,* the literary genius and Author of
Tonsv Wopsu; "we have now a "Whig House!"
Lord LITTLEHAMPTON knew nothing of English politics. His/orte was foreign
affairs "I don't care twopence," he used to say, "for a decline of the revenue,
Reform, or the Corn Laws. Give me real politics—foreign politics 1—keeping
up the name and dignity of England!"
BEN D'YMION was now always spoken of as " Lady LITTLEHAMPTON'S brother.
That was quite enough. There were times when he thought it a good deal too
much. But he had become a youth of fashion, and a Personage!
What more could he want?

BEN D'TMION was very fortunate in his apartments. The RIDLEY'S were quite
Model-Lodging-house-keepers. Though they lived in Ratclifl Highway, tUe

amily was exceedingly refined. The two daughters,
}OBGEOSA and SCIATICA, were the belles of the Metro-
x>lis. There was a table d'hote every day at one o'clock,
Then Earls and Marquises vied with Cabinet Councillors
and the jeunesse doree in walking into the KIDLEY 8
i ashed mutton, and flirting with the daughters.
GOROEOSA, the youngest and handsomest, of course
:ell in love with BEN D'YMION.
So did IRREVALENTA, Countess MFMPFORD.
So did everybody.
TraA saw the danger. "BEN D'YMION," she said one
day, "I 've taken chambers for you at the Albany. You
mutt get to the top of the tree."
"It strikes me,1' said BEN D'YMION, looking from his
window out on to the chimney-pots, "I am as high as I
can be; and as to trees, I am certainly up a pretty
considerable poplar."
"Despondency is the death of action," she rejoined.
"You know my theory, that the Human Will"
"Oh, yes," hastily interrupted BEN D'YMION, "I can't
help knowing it. I've heard it about forty times a
dav"
Then in her fondest tones TYRA resumed, "It shall
have its 'ittie brougham, that it shall, the pretty pet,
and its valet, and it shall be admired, and flattered,
and get into Parliament, and be Prime Minister. That,"
she added, changing to a sterner key, "I have irrevo-
cably determined on, and what the Human Will deter-

CHAPTER THREE.
IRREVALENTA, Conntess MUJIPFORD,* was the genius of
Whiggism, and the Queen of London Society. Of course
she was surpassingly beautiful, or I shouldn't mention
her. Her silken eye-lashes fell on a cheek of calico
whiteness; her eyes were like emeralds of the first water;
aer hair was a delicate amber, and her breath ambero-
sial. Her alabaster fingers were loaded with diamonds;
but there was no danger, as by way of brooch she wore
an inscription—" Beware—Loaded 1 Please not to touch
the fingers."
Her husband, Earl MUMPFOHD, was a most amiable
character. Whenever his wife came home, he went out.
If she had a party, he went fishing in St. James's Park.
Even if he were under the same roof with his spouse, he
never saw her, but always communicated with her by
means of letters, post-cards, and a private telephone.
For all that, he loved her dearly, and she was devoted
to him!
"DYMIE, darling," she said one day to onr hero,
"I 'm going to have a tournament at Mumpford Castle;
you must come up and help."
BEN D'YMION bowed his statuesque form to the ground,
and kissed the lily-white digits of the Peeress.
"And you 're to be Private Secretary to a Cabinet
Minister as well," she went on. "That'll suit you,
won't it, dear?"
"It certainly startles me," said BEN D YMION, gulping
down his emotion. "How can I ever repay you?" he
added, while he took half-a-orown from his pocket,
and wondered if that would be enough.
But IRREVALEKTA, with a queenly gesture, motioned to
him to put the coin back.
"Repay me," she said, "by becoming Prime
Minister."
"I will," said BEN D'YHION, rapturously.
And he purchased a penny guide to the House of Com-
mons, an old number of the Statesman't Year Book, and
became Private Secretary to the Right Hon. SIDNEY
STILTON.

Mumpford Castle was a Northern stronghold. It was on a slight

Ancestral deer roamed about the sylvan domains. There was a

TYRA was the Queen of the Chivalry. Among the cavaliers assem-

FoBSlTAH.to TYRA, in tones that thrilled through her.
"Nay, dearest Prince," replied TYHA. "No one can wearjny
colours, because I am Queen."
The Prince turned his own colour—scarlet, and began to cry.
"What is it, then?" said TYRA, tenderly, as she wiped up the
Prince's tears with her embroidered kerchief.

decease you; and what will poor TTKA do then, poor thing P But I

noblewoman by her jewelled funny-bone, "I believe in Destiny.* I

Wherein the little Zoophyte like garden floweret dwells.
We'll take the fair Anemone from off its rooky seat,

With Oceanic Hydrozoids that HUXLEY knows so well.

The tales of Biogenesis and Protoplasmic lore:

GAIETY AND FOLLY.
DOUBET and Son was reduced to FLORENCE, FLORENCE appeared
as Captain Cuttle twice, and has now disappeared altogether. We
should like to see Mr. FLORENCE m a
good piece; as yet we have not had that
chance. We enjoyed his dry humour
and his artistic acting in the Mighty
Dollar, but a mighty duller piece than
that can scarcely be imagined, always
barring his one part, which he played
to perfection.
As Cuttle he was very funny: he was
the well-known pictorial Cuttle down to
the ground, and so Phiz-ically he was
Cuttle, but morally he was not, unless
Americans interpret CHARLES DICKENS'S
characters after a fashion which is as
unintelligible to us as, we venture to
say, it would have been to the Author.
However, in this compressed American
tinned essence of Dombey and Son,
Captain Cuttle being all FLORENCE,
THE CUTTLE Snow. does not even a "little Paul" on the
audience. An plaisir, Mr. FLORENCE,
if you come with good pieces, we shall welcome your return by
a Large Majority.
There is method in some people's madness, and there is wisdom m
Mr. TOOLE'S Folly, though he doesn't show his entire stock of it all
at once. Nowadays when farce-acting is neglected, and when
farces are of very little value to anybody—being reduced to "a mere
farce"—the notion of giving a
"laughable farce to follow,"
with the principal Comedian in
it is excellent. But then the
farce,should be really "laugh-
able," there should be some-
thing in it as in MORION'S
Grimshaw, Bagshaw, and
Bradshaw, the immortal Box
and Cox, and many others
that take us back to the palmy
days of farce, when people went
to "see WRIGHT," or "see
BUCKSTONE," being sure of an
Adelphi Screamer with WRIGHT
at the one place, and something
so early, came so late, and, when it arrived, the "Crawl,1 despite
our tragedian's most strenuous endeavours, was undeniably slow.
The "utter absurdity" is solely re-
markable for Mr. GARDEN'S wonderful
make up as Signor Gassalieri. which can-
not be properly appreciated except by
those who have previously seen him as
the young Country Squire, Sir Robert
Soobleton, in The Upper Crust. It is
not often that an Actor has two good
chances in one evening; and Mr. GARDEN
invests both parts with such distinct
individuality as shows him to be a
genuine artist.
If Mr. TOOLE, as Mr. Doublechick,
almost exhausts himself, and the merri-
ment of the audience in The Upper
Crust, it is an arduous task to keep
the fun at high pressure through the last
piece, which ought therefore to be very
strong farce, with rattling dialogue, and
laughable situations, capable of support-
ing the Actor, and not depending solely on

THE POINT OF THE PIECE.

I'LO' OF LANGUAGE.

not quite so broad, but equally mirth-provoking, at the Haymarket,
with BUCKSTONE and COMPTON in it.
The Light Fantastic, put forward as "a new and utter absurdity,"
is exactly what it describes itself to be, i.e., it is "new," never
having been played before,—though we fancy Mr. H. J. BYRON could
pretty well tell the value of each jeu de mot he has put into it, and
far be it from us to blame him for evincing a sentimental affection
towards old friends who have rendered him con-
siderable service in their time,—and it is, there
is n9 doubt about it, "an utter absurdity,"
specially in its absurd utter-ances.
The utterly absurd ditty, "The Domestic
Man," is lugged in anyhow, and is not strikingly
comic. "The Domestic Man's " sole merit of
having invariably returned to his own house
for dinner, is not very unlike the refrain of the
song about the gentleman "who always came
home to tea." As the apologists for the resem-
blance of Billee Taylor (why Billee ?) in music
and style of humour to the works of Messrs.
GILBERT and SULLIVAN say, "It's in the same
school."
The intended side-splitter begins well—that
is, Mr. TOOLE begins well, his make-up and
manner being intensely absurd; and the idea
in itself was capital, as affording our popular
tragedian a real good chance of an eccentric-character part. But
when Mr. Samuel Slithery has once been seen, and when in five
minutes you 've become thoroughly acquainted with all that Samuel
Slithery is likely to do, and when there are no fresh situations to
develope Slithery's peculiarities, then Slithery becomes wearisome,
and Slithery finds himself lecturing to a disappointed audience.
The puns may be pearls, and the audience may represent those ani-
mals on whom a shower of pearls is as thrown away as is the best
joke in the world told in a deaf man's ear. Pigs, however, cannot
give their opinions on pearls, but an audience can on puns and pieces;
and if the public throng to The Light Fantastic, we shall be as ready
to admit that there must be " something in it" as Mr. TOOLE will be
to admit everybody. Then the "Crawl," which we had expected
the popularity of an individual performer for its chance of success.
We came away with one deep regret, engendered by the careful
perusal, alas, too late! of the programme, where we found the
following information, that—
"In the Saloon of this Theatre is on view the picture of a Chinese Lady,
painted by Mr. WALTER GOODMAN, who has had the honour of submitting
the work to the inspection of Her Majesty the QUEEN, at Windsor Castle.
This is the first repre«entation of a Chinese Lady in her native costume ever
painted by a European Artist."
What a chance we missed I By the way, the paragraph does not
inform us what opinion HER
MAJESTY was graciously
pleased to express on this
work of art. Was he invited
to submit itf Or was he
smuggled, picture and all,
into Windsor Castle, and
then did he happen to be in
the vestibule as the QUEEN
was passing through, who
said, "What is he doing
there?" "Chinese Lady,
your Majesty," stammered
the Chief Butler. "Take it
away at once," replied the
QUEEN. But this is merely

"an utter absurdity" as an hypothesis. To think, too-that every

not a bad hand at advertising, add it to his daily show— Keal

"First Representation of a Chinese Lady m her Native Costume!

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
A NEW WOULD-BE GOVERNMENT.
To the Scldom-at-Home Secretary.
SIB,—London is about to be pestered with a new form of Govern-
ment. We have Imperial rulers who seem able to manage nothing
that is not ten thousand miles from England; we have Local Rulers
who are pulling down half London at a cost of countless millions,
and fattening a hungry herd of land-jobbers, builders, and con-
new would-be Government is no other than the Meddlevex Irre-
sponsibles, who, probably to save themselves from speedy extinction,
are displaying a fussy activity in fields far beyond the control of
those fossil Acts of Parliament which have enabled them to make
London one of the gloomiest and most disreputable cities in the
world. Yesterday they were annihilating Music-halls, to-day they
are attacking or asking others to attack Convents, and to-morrow
they may be deliberating about Clubs, proposing to inspect ' Flats,'
recommending domiciliary visits to Bachelors' chambers in the Temple
and Lincoln's Inn, instituting inquiries into the happiness of those
who have taken the vows of marriage, and suggesting further
restrictions on private and public liberty.
In their onslaught upon religious bodies they have shown even
more than their average ignorance. During their one-sided dis-
cussion there was no voice to tell them that no religious bodies
object to any inoffensive Government inspection. Sitting in all their
wooden pride and self-sufficiency, glorying in the belief that Clapton
and Stoke Newington are the solitary possessors of the true faith,
and they, the Clerkenwell Fantoccini, the only moral censors, they
had no one to tell them that Catholics are as careful of their sons
and daughters as the strictest Puritans, and far less likely to consign
them to such unlicensed, uninspected prisons as are socially repre-
sented by pharisaically ruled households. Do the Meddlevexers
wish their own residences to be inspected, and Social Inquisitors
appointed to inquire into the domestic affairs of each individual,
from Paterfamilias down to the scullery maid?
The world is often governed, and is sometimes quite content to be
governed, by fools, but the fools must be brilliant, and have some
points of sympathy with the governed. But here is an unwieldy
body of nameless mediocrities, speaking through mouthpieces that
are hardly up to an ordinary Vestry level, who, having made
the licensing system a farce, and our chief thoroughfare an open
market for brazen-faced Vice, are now asking a sluggish Govern-
ment Department that has never yet grappled with half its legitimate
work, to go out of its way to fan the spark of religious discord
into a Smithfield flame. The Law as it exists has full power to deal
with any conventual grievance that may arise.
The Home Office has committed many follies in its time—follies
that have led to crimes: but the instinct of self-preservation, which
Governments share with the lowest animals, will surely save it from
this last act of Clerkenwell inspired idiocy. PUNCH AND JUNTOS.
The "Beak" and the Birch.
"Sir JAMES IXGHAM asked the surgeon if he had ever known any injury
effected by a birch rod.—Mr. MURPHY said he had.—Sir JAMES: But nothing
to signify. There is nothing injurious to health in a good administration of
the birch."
A Schoolboy loquitur—
No doubt, Sir JAMES, you 're very glib and clever, Sir, but still
You 'd find the birch does signify when laid on with a will.
Just let me take the rod in hand, and see how you would feel:
A " good administration " might raise aggravating wheal.
Though not" injurious to health," the birch would make you blench,
And would you sit so easily next day upon the bench?
A Valuable Discovery.
IN a police case reported last week the name of a place in Devon-
shire occurred, Burlescombe. This is, evidently, what the Royalty
Theatre claims in its advertisements to be, "The Ancestral Home of
Burlesque." Who discovered Burlescombe? What a subject for a
picture—"Discovery of Burlescombe in the Regions of Art." Is
there Pantomimecombe anywhere? We must send out explorers.
A Company must be got up first. A Travelling Company on Tour
would be most useful.

TO A LADY DOCTOR.
AN AFFECTION OF THE HEABT.

YES, Doctor, your physio I 've taken,
That surely should conquer my ills;
The bottle was solemnly shaken,
I dote on those dear little pills.
I 've followed your rules as to diet,
I don't know the taste of a tart;
But, though I 'ye kept carefully quiet,—
The pain's at my heart.
Of course you 've done good; convalescence
Seems dawning. And yet, it is true,
I fancy the light of your presence
Does more than your physic can do.
I 'm well when you're here, but, believe me,
Each day when fate dooms us to part,
Come strangest sensations to grieve me—
That must be the heart.
Your knowledge is truly stupendous,
Each dainty prescription I see,
I read " Hauttut statim lumendus,"
What wonder you took the M.D.!
I hang on each word that you utter
With sage JEsculapian art,
But feel in a terrible flutter,—
It comes from the heart.
Have you ever felt the emotion,
That stethoscope ne'er could reveal?
If so, you '11 perchance have a notion
Of all that I 've felt, and still feel.
Oh say, could you ever endure me?
Dear Doctor, you blush and you start.
There's only one thing that can cure me—
Take me—and my heart!
"More Light!"

THE GREEK QUESTION.
YESTERDAY afternoon a meeting was held at Flaneurs' Buildings
to discuss the claims of the Qreeks. Lord CONSTABLE presided, and
among those present were Mr. DAUDLER.M.P., Mr. TWADDLES, M.P.,
Mr. DODDEREB, M.P., Mr. THYCKE HEDDE, M.P., and Mr. AD
GETTER, M.P.
Lord CONSTABLE remarked that he was going to be very brief
(loud expressions of delight), and would say what he had to say in
the smallest possible space. (Renewed demonstrations ef pleasure.) The
Greeks were a very ancient race. Of that there could be no doubt.
(Hear! hear.') Lord BYRON went to Greece and wrote some pretty
poetry about the country. Mr. GLADSTONE (uproarious cheering) was
very fond of HOMER. Hence it was the duty of every Englishman
to support the claims of the Greeks. (Hear ! hear.') Now, what were
the claims of the Greeks? They were indeed multitudinous. For
the Greeks were such a poetic and picturesque nation, that they
would claim anything (cheers), and the less chance they had of getting
what they claimed, the more they would claim it. (Loud cheers.) The
Greeks had been very badly treated, and especially by England.
Would it be believed that during the late administration, an admin-
istration which the speaker was happy to say had died for ever
(cheers), a Greek, a descendant of the race which produced HO.MKJI,
had been sent to prison for writing threatening letters to a lady '<
(Groans.) They might well groan, hut there was even a worse case
in the background. (Sensation.) A Greek named PERICLES ARISTO-
TKLKM, came not long ago over to this country and joined a certain
Club, a Club into which Turks had been admitted. (Oroani.) PERICLES
A&I8TOTELES, with the simple romance which endears the Greek to
the Englishman, played at cards at that Club. Poor, downtrodden,
unsophisticated child of nature, he was discovered with two or three
kings up his sleeve. The speaker and the audience lived in a Chris-
tian country, and he would ask them to moderate their indignation
when they heard that PERICLES ARISTOTELES was actually expelled
from the Club. (Groans.) Was this the way to treat the Greeks? (No!
no.') Was it not an essential part of the Greek's character to keep
kings up their sleeves when they were playing cards? (Hear! hear'}
In the words of the great Greek poet, he would remark, "polu-
phloisboio thalasses" and demand tbat something, he didn't know
what, should be done for the Greeks. (Loud cheers.)
Mr. DODDERER, M.P., concurred with every word that the noble
Lord had said. It was disgraceful to this country to think of the
way in which the Greeks were treated. He actually knew of a
merchant in the City who would not deal with a firm of Greeks be-
cause he said they were such slippery thieves. (Groans.) Yes, he
said they were slippery thieves. (Renewedgroans.)
Mr. THYCKB HEDDE, M.P., knew of even worse instances than had
been quoted. (Sensation.) He had been told of a restaurant in the
City, frequented by Greeks, which blind, bigoted Englishmen had
given up using for the paltry reason that the Greeks stole their
umbrellas. (Groans.)
The meeting then broke up.
THE CITY MONTENEGRO.

I ROSE to show them a half-sovran tail,
To turn to chaff their " freedom " on this height,
Grim, comic, savage; worse by day and night

With dauntless hundreds struggling, main and might,
To cross,—the one policeman out of sight,—
And reach this haven where the strongest quail.

Of Freedom! Why, I merely swell the swarm
That surge and seethe in curses and in tears!

Odd dodges drew the cloud and brake the storm
Have you produced a mightier crop of jeers!

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.

0ms of the gratest trubbles we poor Waiters has is with the Wine. For my
part, after my long experience, I suppose I ought to know a glass of good wine
when I tastes it. and so I do, and to my mind, the finest wine in the world is to
be had at the Alls of the Grate Livery Compennies. And yet there are jellous
Idjuts who wants to abbolish 'em!
But of coarse wen I speex of our trubbel about Wine, I means at Tawuns.
With the old stagers its all rite, we knows what they likes and we gives it "em,
bat wen we has-a lot of young Swells who knows nethink about Wine, in course
we don't give them quite the werry best. It mightn't agree with 'em and would
be like throin Purl afore Swyne.
Well, wen they calls me up and sez, "Waiter, this Port won't do, haven't
you somethink better than this thick stuff?" I takes up the bottle and looks at
it and smells it, and I sez, sez I, "This ain't a bad kind of wine, Gents, but
it isn't the sort of thing they should ha' sent up for such as you. You want a
older and a thinner wine, somethink like wat we gives the LOKD MABE and the
Sheriffs." "Yes," sez they, "of course we do." So away I goes with the
decanter down to the Cellarman, and I sez to him, "BILL," sez I, "here's
sum young swells up stares as wants a older and thinner wine," and I tips him
a wink. "All right, ROBEHT," sez he, so he pours out a glass and he drinks
it, andjthen he pours out another glass and I drinks it, and then he takes the
Water Can and fills up the Decanter and gives it to me, and then he gives me
an old bottle quite black with crust, that he keeps on purpose, and up I goes to
the young Swells. And then I takes 'em all clean glasses, and I fills 'em very
carefully, and shose 'em the old black bottle, and a fine old cork as I always
carris in my waistcoat pokit, and I waits while they drinks. "Ah," sez one
of 'em, "this is somethink like, this is, it's just like the wine we used to get at
my Guv'nor's or my Uncle's," as the case may be, and they all goes away happy
and contented.
Ah, it's a funny world, my Lord Bishup!
I think it has been Bed that more lies is told about the nobbiest of all ani-
mals, Hosses, than about anything in the world, but I should back the noblist
of all drinks, Wine, and I bleeve that for good downwrite unmisstaketable
Lyin, Wine would beat Hosses all into fits and win in a Decanter I
Job and Mayjob.
THB Temple Bar obstruction is to cost something like £30,000, though the
original estimate was £6,000. The obstinacy shown by the Corporation in
this matter has even disgusted the tutelary deities of the City. They propose
to change their names to JOB and MATJOB.
A GUILD GOOD FOR SOMETHING.
[REFEBRIHG to a change lately made hy the Society of
Apothecaries in its business arrangements for the sale of
drugs, the City Preie remarks :—
"The reputation which Apothecaries' Hall ha* always had for
the purity of the drugs to be obtained there will not be diminished
one iota by the change, but will, if that be possible, be added to.
The Society of Apothecaries is one of the City Companies which
has retained to the present day its ancient functions to the
advantage of the community, and the Society has devoted the
funds at its disposal to giving prizes in competition in botany
for registered students, prizes in botany also for young women,
pharmaceutical chemistry, &c. The Society has also a fund for
widows, and one for distressed members, &o."]
DEEM not the Civic Guilds a prey
To rank corruption, all,
For one can bear the light of day;
Apothecaries' Hall:
In scientific trade expert,
A Guild whose goods are sure,
Select, and clear of dregs and dirt;
Their drugs, and hands too, pure.
Culture of physic to promote
In part their bounty tends;
Endowments partly they devote
To charitable ends:
Do not as those who pocket cash
__ They should by right bestow.
Nor cause in green-fat, calipash,
And calipee, to go.
0 Gog and Magog, there's a Guild,
Whereof you well may brag,
Not as of bodies overfilled
By means of squandered swag:
A Guild unspotted by the stain
Of malversation see,
For choice, a gentleman were fain,
Of that Guild, rather, free.
If they to Hero, Prince, or Peer
Their freedom should concede,
The 'Pothecaries him, no fear,
Would honour do indeed.
So speed the Gallipot-Scrapers, thrive
The Pestle-iand-Mortar-PHers I
And may their Hall for aye survive
In Water Lane, Blackf riars!
REMARKABLE DISCOVERY IN LONDON.
A.D. 2002.
DUBING the excavations for the New Sulphuric Rail-
way now in course of construction between Whiteehapel
and Tyburnia, the workmen unearthed a curious ruin,
which at first was naturally supposed to be the remains
of a Roman villa. This belief was fostered by the dis-
covery of a variety of Roman coins, fragments of urns,
broken implements of war, and other ancient relics of
that period, until an expert dispelled this illusion by
proving the coins and other curiosities to be modern
antiquities made in Birmingham, and supplied wholesale
to the workmen, who sell them to the collectors. Further
researches established the fact that the supposed Roman
villa was a building quite as rare and extinct—a casino,
or dancing-room, standing in a garden. There were one
or two broken statues of Terpsichore, or some other god-
dess appropriate to the place, a rusty gas device, and
parts of a structure that had doubtless been an orchestra.
A circular platform, which had evidently stood in the
open air, and in all probability had been used for dancing
in fine weather, was discovered in a wonderful state of
preservation. Several eminent Archteologists have de-
cided that the place was once the Dodo Gardens, and was
the last place of amusement abolished by a magisterial
body known as the Parliament of Sacred Jackasses, who
did their best to (Juakerise London in 1880.

IN the Telephone Case the
A.TTOBNBZ-GENBRAL made a pun-
ning point—a rare exception to
the pointless pun -which, coming
from an eminent Counsel, elicits
"laughter" from his own side,
or if made by the Bench, sends
the whole Court into fits—an
expression which, incongruously
enough, suggests the idea of
"The Court going into Mourning."
Nothing in the history of wit and
humour is so invariably success-
ful as a Judge's joke. It must be
laughed at. Everybody, from the
leading Q.C. down to the Police-
man, is interested in laughing at
it; and the weaker the pun the
stronger must be the laughter.
In the Telephone Case Mr.
BENJAMIN told the old story
about the Marquis de ST. CTH,
and the Republican Commissary.
It was greeted with "laughter."
Whereupon the ATTOBNBY-GENE-
BAL—not the late, but the early
one—observed, that "this was
not a 'sin-cere' argument,"
which was rewarded with " much
laughter."

rescue a poor, harmless old woman from the hands of
Rome brutal French policemen. Whereupon, he was
hauled off, and, says the Paris Correspondent of the
Times, "after thirty hours of ill-usage, fasting, im-
prisonment, and sleeplessness, Mr. GRISEWOOD was libe-
rated without any penalty, without any investigation or
decision—the best proof that nothing could be seriously
alleged against him!"
But what wonder in a country where the Govern-
ment agents arrest their own countrymen for crying
out " Vive la Libertf!" "What wonder in a country
where peaceable citizens who live but to benefit their
fellow-men are expatriated, and LOUISE MICHEL, the
pftrolense, is received with acclamation, and her speeches
applauded to the echo, by those who enlist under the
motto, " Ni Dieu, ni Maitre!"
Mr. GRISEWOOD may be to blame for not knowing the
French language, but he is scarcely to blame if being
acquainted only with the traditional chivalric character
of the French nation, he failed to comprehend that the
brutality of four policemen towards a poor, inoffensive
old woman could be tacitly permitted by the manly by-
standers, and, least of all, sanctioned and approved of
by high officials, whose one idea of retaining their own
liberty seems to consist, as Figaro has already declared,
in " suppressing the liberty of others."

•
F course I knew something about
the official home of the under-
writers of England "who lived at
home at ease," and, in spite of
their comfort, were thoroughly
conversant "with the dangers of
the seas." A London dictionary
had told me that they were an
association of gentlemen dating
from 1668, and that since 1774 they
had occupied an upper floor of
the Royal Exchange—ancient and
modern. But I had drawn upon
my "inner consciousness" for the
rest. I had imagined clients in
the shape of tough, weather-beaten
sea-captains doing business with
staid old gentlemen seated behind
high desks covered with gigantic
ledgers. I had thought it possible
that now and again a piercing
shriek would break the solemn calm as some poor orphan found by
the notice-board of wrecks, that the ship upon which all her hopes
were centred had sunk beneath the wave. Then I felt certain a
sympathetic group of veteran underwriters would hasten to offer
consolation, while some one (in the distance) played a low and touching
chant on a hidden organ. The poor orphan, having received untold
gold (from a benevolent fund kept for the purpose) would retire under
the guardianship of two sea-captains of venerable appearance, who
would declare that they would look after her " while a single shot
remained in poor old Davey's locker," or something to the same
nautdcally kind-hearted effect. And then staid, necessary, and old-
fashioned business would commence once more. So much for my
ideal of Lloyd's, and now for the reality.
I pushed open a swing-door, and came face to face with a beadle.
He was more useful than ordinary beadles, for he was looking after
some sticks and umbrellas. Then I ascended three flights of dark
and dirty stairs fragrant with the fumes of smoke and cooking, and
pushed open another swing-door to come face to face with a second
beadle, who seemed to be about twice the size of the first. With the
grace of a polite and civilised ogre, he asked me my business,
mentioned the name of a friend. Suddenly the name was repeated
in stentorian accents, suggesting a mixture of a blast from a fog-
signal and a report from a four-thousand-and-eighty-one-ton gun.
Before the reverberating echoes had died away in the vaulted hall,
a gentleman of the most engaging manners appeared before me.
The gentleman was not my friend, but my friend s friend. He was
extremely amiable, and in a second I was free of the place.
I passed the cheery shouter in the beadle's uniform and entered the
great hall. It was, indeed, a wonderful place I Instead of the
aged book-keepers I had pictured to myself, I found a number oi
dear acquaintances, more suggestive of the stalls at the Opera thai
business in the very heart of the City of London. One and all seemed
delighted to see me, although I had not come to insure the Great
Eastern. TOMMY, BILLY, FHAHK, and JACK were all there. We
had just begun to discuss the merits of the last Gaiety Burlesque,
when I was startled with a "Bang!" a " ting!" a " smash!" and,
lastly, a " crash I"
"What was it?" I asked, expecting to hear that it was the
breaking up of some ill-fated vessel on the iron-bound coast of India,
or elsewhere, the sounds of which were now being faithfully trans-
mitted to Lloyd's by a new electric telephone of extra power.
"That's nothing," said TOMMY; "only the chimes on the top o1
the Royal Exchange I They give us a tune for every day of the
week. This morning it's 'The Roast Beef of Old England.' "—
"Bang—wang—ting a ring—boo!" went the chimes defiantly.—
"No, it isn't,1' he continued; "' The Roast Beef of Old England
is kept for Saturday. Stay—it's ' The Old Hundredth.'"
He listened; and as he recognised a more than usually discord an
"crash," corrected himself with the observation, "that when he sail
'The Old Hundredth,' of course he meant ' God Save the Queen.'"
My ears at last had rest; and after feasting my eyes upon the
feeblest statue of Prince ALBEBT in the world, (which appeared to
be looking about for an absent screen) another sense was assailed.
"Yes," said BILLY, answering an interrogatory sniff, "it is no;
pleasant! We have spent a heap upon ventilation, but it's no go
First we pumped in sewer gas; then when that didn't seem to do
we pumped in something else. Now when it's windy outside, we are

you would think we were passing our time in keeping live rabbits
and making mutton-broth—now, wouldn't you P"

Fortunately my Friend's Friend interposed before I had time to
answer. He had been exchanging merry remarks with some young
fentlemen, who seemingly had been
unning up to him to tell him cer-
;ain "good things." He now apo-
ogised for this. "They are my

peers in their own right are admitted here!" and he was off before I
could make any further inquiries. Entering a sort of cupboard, we
saw the telephone in full operation. JACK was sending a message to
TOM about something nautical—I think 'Billet Taylor. Next we
entered a library, apparently full of dictionaries. There were also
some models of new inventions. "Great larks those," said RF.GY,
putting his head in. "We get the inventors to explain them!"
"And now," said my Friend's Friend, as REGY disappeared, "you
must see the Captain's Room."
I paused, and a vision of Captain Cuttle appeared before me. I
took out my note-book ready to record the tales of stormy adven-
tures I expected to hear re-
lated. I even headed a page
with " How I Weathered the
Horn in "26." I was prepared
to find myself in a whole kennel
of aged sea dogs. I thought
I should find hooks for arms,
and gigantic telescopes in lieu
of umbrellas. I nearly hitched
up my trowsers in sympathy,
and brushed up my vocabulary
(limited) of sea terms. _I passed

There was a luncheon bar
I was received with a
shout of hospitality. I tried an appropriate joke about " the chops

latest story from the "Steak" in exchange for the freshest " good

"But why?" I asked—" why the Captain's Room?" "I am sure
I don't know," answered ALGY, sipping his Chablis; "'spose it's

The Hursley Hounds came over the Down,
As straight as flies the Crow,
To Barton Farm nigh Winchester Town,
Into the vale below,
Where Itohen's waters flow.

Squires in vermilion,
Horse and filly on,
Yoicks sing Tally-ho!

They went and drew the Winnal Moors,
In a bed where osiers grow,
And they found sly Reynard out of doors,
Where the scent of him served to show.
He went off as the wind did blow,
Whiuh way all foxes know;
Southwards following,
We went holloaing
Yoioks, sing Tally-ho!
Yoicks, &c.
The hounds behind him off the scent
With deep design to throw,
O'er Winton's Northern Walls he went
As fast as bolt from bow.
And asylum sought from woe;
The domain of Dame DILLOWE:
But they turned him out

In a thoroughfare, long ago

Now this was a case of a genuine chase,
For which there was cause to show.
It was doing away with a beast of prey;
We had reason for doing so;
And our huntsmen thanks we owe,
For they laid the purloiner low,
And stopped Reynard's thieving;

Here it is again,—the old-fashioned
cruel vulgarity, that no preaching, no pro-
test, no satire, no effort that kindly and
earnest sympathy can make, seems able to
suppress. Some refined and well educated
lady, for the reference to her accomplish-
ments presupposes gentle antecedents, is to
eat the bread for which her necessities oblige
her to toil in discomfort, humiliation, and
pain. There is an accepted courtesy which,
in dealing with ugly social blots such as
the above, erases the published initials, or
name and address of the offender, and Mr.
Punch, who is orthodox, follows the fashion.
But he doubts whether it is always a wise
or a right thing to do so. It seems hard
that a poor Governess should not be warned
off such a home as that offered in this ad-
vertisement, where it is quite clear that if,
on the one hand, she escape the menial food
prepared for her in the kitchen, she may
have to face something infinitely more de-
grading and unrefined, in the shape of the
social atmosphere of the drawing-room.

THE IRISH FROG PUZZLE WITH A DEAL OF CROAKING.
THE PLEASING BIRTHDAY BOOK.
Mr DEAR MB. PCWCH,
I SUPPOSE it has happened to you, not once or twice, but a
hundred times, to be asked to inscribe your name in some young
Lady's birthday book. It 'a a nuisance, and should it not be miti-
gated before long, I intend retiring from the world and seeking
some spot where neither of those abominable arts—reading and
writing—is known. The worst of the matter is the want of appro-
priateness in the mottoes selected for these birthday volumes. 1 am
middle-aged, a bachelor, tolerably well-off, and opposite to where
I inscribed my name the other day was—
"Short time seems long in Sorrow's sharp aii-tuiiiing;
Though woe be heavy yet it seldom sleeps,
And they that watch see Tune how ilow it creeps."

In the first place, I don't mind confessing that I don't understand
the meaning of the above. In the second place, if I did, I don't see
how it would apply to me. Subjoined is my idea of a birthday-book,
if we are to have those evils at all. In these days of mixed society
you will probably in any room get some dozen of the people enumer-

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CFTARTVART.

A^FALLOW WHO WON'T THROW HIMSELF
AWAY, AND A iTLLuiV WHO IIOKS.
LOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP;
OR, THE EOT, THE BOGIE, AND THE INVISIBLE INVALID.
THK above heading should he the title of Mr. COGHLAN'S Thrfe-
\nt Plav, finod f'n'tuna. at the St. James's. The plot is simply
'hia. The Earl of Xenth is left penniless, so he drops his title, calls
himself hy his family name nf Dunis, and iroes as bailiff to the
Ransome laiuily—at least we believe it's the Runsome family, or, at
all events, a rather mixed
family living at Mr. Rau-
siniie's, Torwen House,
"Wales. Here he falls iu
love with Miss Rantnme,
and she snubs him. They
are looked up in a ruined
tower together on the
Ranxomt estate, and to
avoid the scandal which
would be her ruin—it is
her father's Ruin where
they are looked up — he
jumps down Iroiu a peri-
lous height, of at least four
feet, and then the lady it
subsequently released b\
an accidental nountrymau
The hero's agilit.y wins her
heart, and she would marry
him straight off were it
not necessary to spin out a
,?~"^*fc ^*^>tf^x . Third Act by some pur-
poseless plotting; and the
purposeless plotting not
being sufficient, the hero-
ine finds that her money
is really his money; and as he won't have it at any price, the)
agree to divide it, and make it thr.ir money jointly. That's all.
The great situation in the piece always was the Lover's Leap,
which at the Haymarket Mr SO'IHKHN U:-ed to make really sensa-
tional; but here, after a feeble scene, Mr. KKNDAL, as Lord Neuth
lays hold of the branch of a " practicable" tree, swings easily down
behind a wall, is M en to pass the aperture, then disappears quietly
helow, when Lord Neuth becomes Lord Onder-neath; but nobody ^
thrilled—everybody sees there is no danger; and, worse than all,
the interest iu these two characters awakened iu the First Act—
which is by far the beat—has utterly disappeared long before the end
of the Second.
Just when a dashing action would rouse the audience from their
apathy, the Hero of
Romance shows the utmost
caution, and evidently
beiring iu mind the old
proverb, "Look before
you leap," he takes a very
good look a-head before
taking a verv bad leap.
Mr. JOHN CLAYTON plays
the part of a pnri.lv but
crafty Baronet, Sir Oeurge
frtrtoic—who talks in the
""aw-'aw-ya-as" style,
and is a vewwy absurd
Fallow indeed.
Oue of the best cha-
racters in the piece is Mr.
WisllAX'&SpeiiCer Ward,
the Solicitor, capitally
made up, and unlike him-
self in any previous per-
formance at this theatre.
The same may be said of
Mr. MACKINTOSH'S Gilbert,
an eccentric old family
servant, who seemed to
have been dug out of an
old-fashioned farce.
Mrs. STEPHENS as Lady
Banks, and Mrs. MURRAY
as Mrs. Ransoms, — the
Ransomes and the Banks
come together naturally—

THE BOY AND THE BOGIE; OB, ISABELLA
AND HKK UMBRELLA,
are both excellent. The unconscious villain of the piece is the mischie-
vous Welsh boy—a regular little welsher—who lucks the door of the
ruin, and then when Mrs. KKNU.U. halloas to him from the top of
the tower, he is suiipoitd to be to utterly frightened by her hat—it

OLD SLYBOOTS THE INVISIBH INVALID,
CHUCKLIAO OVER IT—" WHAT LAKHS!"
i« a startler—and her six-foot sun-shade, which looks like a portable
tent, that he taktM to his heels and bolts incontinently,— probably
over the border of the Principality into England, as he is never heard
of or si-en again.
Then there is the Invisible Invalid who is alwas supposed to be at
his last ga>-p. always send-
ing for CHARLES DKNIS—
CHAKLF.S his only friend—
either to play dearie with
him or to make his will.
Everything depends on his
will — unless we entirely
misunderstood the plot—
and the audience are as
fully able to realise the old
boy chuckling to himself
up-stairs in bed at all the
trouble he is giving, as
they are to imagine Mr.
KKNDAL's scene in the
circle on a highly-trained
steed off the stage, so
graphically described by
Miss Ransome, who wit-
nesses the performance
from the balcony. This description, whirh brings the curtain down
on a successful Fiist Act, is well written — as is the dialogue
generally- and cleverly acted.
The Third Act is very weak. Miss Ranaome has fo read an
explanatory latter, informing her how her grandfather—we couldn't
quite follow it—had once been a boy—an extraordinary thing for a
if rand father at any time of course—and had surprised the entire
British Army in India to such an extent that he collared all their
money (we. admit that we could not follow.the details of the crime
^xartly), came over to Eng-
land, made a fortune, and
when adopting the motto of
'Rurtsitrrie »s as jRujisorne
dims," it suddenly occurred
to him that he ought to
refund the coin to the repre-
sentative of the British Army
in India, if alive, or to his
heir, who, of course, happens
to be, curiously enough, Lard
Neath. 80 Mist Ranxome,
who thought that Lord Ntath
was only making up to her
for her money (she has a
hundred million thousand,
or some trifla of that sort),
hands over her fortune to
him, and delicately hints
that he may take her with
it; but Lord Neath hands it
hack to her. And so, as far
us we can see, they might
_-o on at this battledore and
-huttlecook business through an indefinite number of Acts till death
• lid them part, and on this unsatisfactory conclusion the curtain
Mually descends, and the audience with Mils Squeert asks, "Is this
iheAeud?"
The best end would have been for Old Rantnme, the Invisible
Invalid, to have rushed on in his dres-ing-gown, and eating, "Take
her-be happy I" to have had on* violent struggle with the nomio
Cutler, ai,d been oariied back- forcibly to bed. Mr. HAKE might
have played this, as there were several opportunities for him to have
had a Q-:iet Rubber with Mr. KENDAL—double dummy of course—
and Mr. KiiMi.vi. might have made a few suggestions for the disposal
uf his property out of My Uncle's Will.
Our Artist has represented Mr. KKNDAL with his sketch-book and
pencil. This is a good omen for the success of the piece, as it illus-
trates the situation in Act II., where Mr. KiMIAL appears to draw.

FOG. ITS FOES AND ITS FRIENDS.
THE Fog-Fiend must be shaking in his dirty old shoes. His realm,
comparable only to that of Chaos and old Night, is menaced by many
foes. Mr. Punch has evidently Cartoonised them into dangerous
activity, and his urgent appeal to Science and Common Sense is being
energetically responded to. Councils and Committees, lectures and
letters to the papers, mean mischief to the villanous hanger-on of Old
King Coal.
That cheery Potentate will have to part company with his unclean
vriitege. Let him put that in his pipe, and not smoke it. Science
and Society have arrived—at last—at the conviction thatuneonsumed
carbon and sulphurous acid in the atmosphere and the human lungs
ire tine illustrations of PAXMEBSTON'S smart definition of dirt—matter
in the wrong place. Also that their presence in either locality is not
i law of nature, but an accident of ill-contrived human arrangements.
3o one more time-honoured Old Nuisance is deprived of the pretext
)f Necessity, one more Inevitable Evil receives Notice to Quit.
Eooray!
Since 1843 legislative enactments of one sort and another have
nore or less feebly and ineffectively shown fi*ht against the Fog
Fiend and his friends. Fur the disreputable old demon has friends.
Whilst Bumbledom is stupid, and Vested Interest selfish what
Ancient Nuisance will lack them P Acts whose operation is left to
.he initiative of vestries and the police are like pulp-shotted pop-
runs, powderless and powerless. "Thou shall consume thine own
smoke," looks a tremendous fiat. But what a toothless old lion of
a legislative lark it becomes when followed by the humorous saving
clause "as far as possible." Time and saving clauses would Nioo-
demus into nothing a Medo-Persic Ultimatum.
The Sub-Committee on Fog and Smoke, and all other Anti-Fog
agencies, have their work out out. Forests of Factory chimneys,
three million* and a half of fire-places, and all the selfishness,
itnpidity, obstinacy, and inertia represented by or associated with
hese facts,—practical reformers will not want tellin g what a f ormid able
irray of opposition forces is here. Cloud and chimney may readily
>e tackled, but foggy wits and fixed interests are harder to deal with,
rvhen the question Bituminous v. Anthracite is raised, look out for
quails between the vendors of Anthracite and Bituminous Coal. Gas
ires, slow combustion stoves, compulsory enactments for depriving
coal of its smoke-producing quality, every suggestion for improve-
ment will bring up its own batch of indignant protestants or con-
temptuous pooh-poohers. Mr. E. CHADWICK says he believes that ii
the Smoke nuisance were removed, the washing bill of the Metro-
polis, which he estimated at six millions annually, might be reduced
by one half! And tht-n, of course, there would be revolt among tht
soap-makers, and insurrection among the laundresses.
But though the Fog Fiend will die hard, yet he will have to die.
When mist and smoke get together, they go in for fiendish high-jinke
and " make a night of it "—even at midday. What is doubtless tun
to them, is death to ua. Like the fleet at Dulcigno, they must receive
orders to " part company." Science can find other uses for uncon-
sumed carbon than darkening our days, defacing our monuments,
and irritating our bronchial mucous membranes. Carbon is too use-
ful a creature to waste its heat-generating power upon the City air,
and choke the multitudes it was intended to comfort. An immense
per-oentage of heat-producing power squandered, with the result oi
spoiling our City, and raising our death-rates 1 That is the state oi
things that Science and Sense have to deal with. The interested
friends of the status quo will please stand aside and let Science and
Sense have a fair field and lots of favour. The ttatus quo is humor-
ously represented by TOM HOOD'S graphic picture oi " November."

"BREAKING UP!"
THE British Admiral-in-Chief ran up his last signal.
There was a distant and dill used clatter of opening telescopes, but
the next moment " Part Company" had fluttered out gaily from the
haly'rds. "I hope it's clear," he said, eyeing it critically. Therehas
heen no end of a bother to get them to understand some of 'em—hut
I fancy they '11 make that out fast enough."
He was right. A prolonged cheer in five different languages
floated pleasantly in on the breeze. Then without an instant's delay
the Admirals followed. With a wonderful alacrity they had come
to take their leave.
"Weil, Gentlemen," said the Chief, looking at them with an affable
smile, "if manoeuvring had happened to have been the order of the
day, evidently you would have all been smart enough, eh?" A
quiet wink went round the party. This pleased and encouraged him.
"And now, as to our next place of meeting P" he continued, looking
inquiringly towards the Parinian sailor. "I think I gathered from
you that you would have no objection tn the Pireeus P
The Berlin salt interposed "The Piifflus!" he said decisively,
"You must mean Primrose Hill."
Thin was explained to the others. They instantly nodded their
assent. The Admiral-in-Chief seemed puzzled.
"Well, Gentlemen," he said, surveying them once more good-
humouredly, "I suppose we shall meet again somewhere t"
"Not a doubt ot it!" responded the spokesman of the party,
promptly. "Quite look forward to it, all of you—don't you?
He turned to his confreres with another agreeable wink. Again
they responded to it heartily. The Admiral-in-Chief still smiled.
'* Well," he said kindly, "come, you '11 all admit, at any rate, it
was a very pleasant meeting. You can't deny that there were some
excellent dinners."
'Excellent I" they all said, in a breath, "Excellent!"
1 And the change of air has done 'em all a deal of good P"
'A deal—a deal!" was the quick rejoinder.
'And not a single iron-clad was run down by the rest and sent to
the bottom!"
'Not one! Not a single one!" they echoed quite enthusiastically.
'Well then, Gentlemen," continued the Chief, summing up, and
preparing to take his departure, "I think we may fairly admit to
ourselves that it has been a really great success I"
"Great P" they once more shouted in unison. "Immense!
Immense!"
Then the party broke np.
There was a friendly exchanging of addresses, some hearty hand-
shaking, an embrace—and even a tear or two.
And so, with one last quiet wink all round, the Admirals
separated.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
The Agricultural Hall.
THE vast building: at Islington is nothing if not sporting. In the
summer the Horse Show makes its appearance, and Bioyle and
Pedestrian Contests are held in the spring and autumn. A menagerie
is quite at home in the place, and a circus can generally be accom-
modated with house-room. Sometimes a panorama appears for a
few weeks, to disappear, with much satisfaction, into the provinces
The only real exception, however, to the rule is a body of Nigger
Minstrels, who are usually to be found singing pathetic melodies and
making well-seasoned jokes in one of its many recesses. But by far
the greatest " feature " of the year is the Cattle Show.
After passing " the Angel," I found hundreds of " Sandwich men"
silently imploring Farmer GILUS, ROBIN, and DOLLY to visit this
music-hall and that theatre. The vendors of patent medicines, too,
appeared to imagine that none of the family could safely return to
their rural home without taking back with them enormous packets
of nostrums. Everybody seemed ready to disinfect them, to counter-
act the baneful effects of intemperance for them, to save them from
the horrors of sea-sickness. One pertinacious advertiser was evidently
convinced that our country cousins had never seen a cake of soap.
Another was more than anxious to cure the toothache that too often
results from a self-sacrificing career devoted entirely to agricultural
pursuits. Having noticed all this, I turned up my nose scornfully
at the presentment of a fat lady exhibiting at a rival show, fought
my way through a moving forest of cabs and omnibuses, and entered
the Hall.
Instead of the typical Farmer GILES and his family (of the
Transpontine Theatres), I found ruddy-faced young gentlemen, in
what the reporters would call "the height of fashion," lounging
at the many bars, and chatting affably with the sprightly female
attendants. Their fathers wore beards and moustaches, and bore a
faint resemblance to the Poet LAUREATE. The ladies of the family
had doubtless visited the show on the five shilling day to see the
Prince, and now were conspicuous by their absence. The most
thoroughly agricultural looking people in the place were unquestion-
ably Londoners. The Cockneys affected pot hats, and never
approached an unpleasantly corpulent bullock without punching
him in the side with the forefinger of the right hand, or prodding
him in the back with a stick. If the obese animal paid no attention
to these unprovoked outrages, they seemed satisfied that he must be
"as sound as a bell." If, on the other hand, the bull gave proofs
that he was sufficiently unencumbered with superfluous flush to move
an inch, they beat a hasty and undignified retreat. I passed fat
sheep and fat oxen by the
dozen, and at length came
to the attraction of the
show. This was an enor-
mous grey and white steer
surrounded by a hurdle.
The poor creature seemed
profoundly unconscious of
the sensation he was cre-
ating. His lair was shared
by a countryman, who was
seated under a placard
bearing the startling and
puzzling announcement,
71 The Best Beast in the
Show." The steer, who, it
appeared, belonged to Mr.
COLMAN, M.I-., seemed to take interest iu nothing but food. As I
watuhed him, in company with some fit't.v other pushing admirers, a
load of hay was carted up to the pen. Upon noticing his lunch, Mr.
COLMAN'B brute indulged in a sort of nickering wink, which was
accepted by the bystanders as a bovine equivalent to a human smile.
Perhups awed by the protecting presence of his guardian, none of us
for a long while dared to punch him in the trie, although all our right
forefingers tingled to he at him. At last a young lady, (who, by the
way, was not exactly my idea of a farmers daughter), ventured to
poke him stealthily in the ribs with a fan. Mr. (Joj,MAN'S brute
made no effort to resent the assault, and we were satisfied that he
deserved the cups that had been showered upon him. After this
the prodding became general.
I had seen in the newspapers, with feelings of gratified loyalty, that
the QUEEN had taken two prizes in small white pigs. It wai obvi-
ously necessary that I should inspect the fioyal property. 80 trust-
ing to one or another of my senses I made my way to the porcine
retreat. On entering I was informed by numerous placards that the
place was disinfected by some well-advertised material. Without
pretending to be much of a judge of perfumes, I think on the whole
I should have preferred the pigs au naturel. But this is a detail, and
I may be old-fashioned in my likings. I found the hogs faat asleep.
There was but one exception, a truculent-looking brute who seemed

to be employing his ample leisure in making ingenious but un-
successful attempts to murder his next door neighbour through the
bars of his stye, because the
latter had been " highly com-
mended," when he had been
passed over in silence. The
Jttoyal beasts were reclining
in the orthodox fashion, and
did not seem to be missing
much the purple velvet fit-
tings, the richly - liveried
lackeys, and other
irgeous
accessories, which doubtless
characterised the home pen
at Windsor. The bystanders
regarded the distinguished
porkers with awe, and
seemed delighted when they
contrived "to catch the
grunter's eye." The general im pression was that each of the animals
"looked every inch a pig." I do not believe that a single person
in the admiring throng grudged H&B MAJJISTI the £10 she had
gained so meritoriously.
I had left the Bazaar to the last, feeling that in its instructive halls
I should be able to bring my agricultural education to a successful
conclusion. I had pictured to myself all kinds of rural curiosities.
Although I had seen specimens of roots and farm instruments in the
Galleries, I thought that the best specimens would be reserved for
the Museum. I entered. Immediately a lively young Lady
claimed my attention by volubly describing the numerous merits of
a needle-threader! However as this little instrument had certainly
some connection with sewing, I accepted it as remotely connected
with Agriculture, and passed on. Had I seen this?" asked a
second lively young Lady, nearly as voluble as the first. I certainly
had not. "This" was a doll smoking a small windmill in its mouth
like a cigar, and wearing a mechanically expanding and contracting
opera-hat of grotesque construction. The second young Lady urged
me earnestly to purchase this truly rural "exhibit," but finding that
I was disinclined to invest any money in such a property, became
convinced that I could not possibly support existence without a box
nf tin BnlHiaru'

UNCLASSIFIED STOCK.
of tin soldiers!
Tearing myself away, I came to other lively Ladies. "Would I
look at this, that, and t'other?" was
murmured in both my ears, and,
before I could remonstrate, all kinds
of miscellaneous articles were forced
upon me. I found that in the Bazaar
belonging to the Smithfield Cattle
Show "Agriculture" was considered
a very wide terra. It included fuzee-
boxes, medicine-bottles, comic songs,
biinbons, marking-ink, patent cement,
hair-oil, and gas-burners. To judge
from the wares presented to them,
our country cousins must not only be
wealthy but eccentric. At one end of
the Hall a gentleman was lecturing
upon the " cheapest shilling's-worth
that ever was seen." As I approached,
he pointedly addressed me—"I have
sold them at Scarborough to the
greatest engineers in the world, and
they represented themselves peifeotly
satisfied with their purchase." Sub-
sequent investigation disclosed the faot that the gentleman was
attempting, by his eloquence, to force a sale of pegtops aud pen-
knives! I walked on, and notic-d that nearly all the stall-keepers
were attempting to emulate the Lecturer on Scientific Subjects at the
Royal Polyteiinio Institution. "This useful little instrument,"
said one, "is well worthy of the attention of the Press and the
Public. By inserting it with a rotary movement into a cork thus,
it takes a firm hold, when the cork may be removed from the mouth
of the bottle with the greatest facility." And a brilliant experi-
ment in cork-drawing followed. I found that the smaller the
article the more the vendor had to say about it. Weary with im-
portunities to buy this and that, I at last came to a youth of retiring
manners. In the fitness of things he should have been a salesman of
sugar-sticks or hair-dye. He evidently did not care about speaking
to me unless I opened the conversation. I stood still, and stared
at him. Thus encouraged, he plucked up courage to address me.
"Please. Sir," said he, m a deferential tone, "would you like to buy

Fearing that I might be lured by this new temptation into unan-
ticipated expenditure, I thought it best to beat a retreat. As I left
the Agricultural Hall, thousands of fresh comers were entering,
ready, I felt sure, to prod the beasts with the utmost heartiness.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
CITY PROPRIETIES.
A MOST respectable appeal case
was tried at the Guildhall Quarter
Sessions a few day« ago. It was
called Regina v. Brouks, The
Recorder presided, and there was
a very fall bench of Aldermen.
Distinguished Counsel appeared
both fur and against the prosecu-
tion, and no outward sign was
wanting to show that it was a bund
fide trial. The Defendant, with a
waggon of fish and ice, obstructed
Lowest Thames Street for several
honrs on a certain day as far back
The City Police Com-
mittee thought they would pro-
secute, and, of course, were quite
ignorant of the fact that they had
no authority. The Markets Com-
mittee, who ought to have prose-
cuted, looked on calmly, and, of
course, were quite ignorant of the
fact that they were the only legal
representatives of the injured and
insulted Corporation. The Tolls
Committee filled its pockets and
said nothing. The Counsel and
the Bench behaved admirably. A
little discussion was necessary
before the conviction could be de-
cently quashed. This discussion
was cleverly regulated. There
was j ust enough of it to give a dig-
nified tone to the proceedings, and
yet net enough to bore the assem-
bly. The conviction was quashed.
Mr. POLAND, of course, asked for
a case, which, equally of course,
was granted by the Court with
stately politeness. In face of the
dirt and blackguardism of Lowest
Thames Street, it was quite beauti-
ful to see such a perfect reproduc-
tion of the Menuet de la Cour.

By the Author of " Loafair," $c.
VOLUME THE THIRD.
CHAPTER ONE.
IBHBVALENTA was determined that BEN D'YMION should have a
Seat. She was a Whig, and, of course, devoted to Electoral Purity
and Popular Rights.
"You haven't got such a thing as a Rotten Borough about you?"
she asked the Electioneering Head-Agent for the Whigs.
A momentary contraction of the left eye-lid passed across the
countenance of the myrmidon. "Borough?" he said with affected
simplicity. "You mean the thing that rabbits"
IBREVALENTA'S Tartarean eye-brows corrugated. "Paltry Vassal!"
she exclaimed; "when I ask for a Seat, I get it. Give me a seat!"
And she took one on a resplendent nickelplated ottoman.
"Oh!" exclaimed the Agent, "'tis a Seat in Parliament you
require? Now I understand. You shall have it. Clodborough is
yours."
BKN D'YMION became an M.P. So did KIDLEY, the Lodging-house-
Keeper. So did PONSO, the Sailor. So did everybody.
CHAPTER Two.
''ALL this time FORSITAN was looked up in SIDNEY STILTON'S coal-
hole. SIDNEY STILTON was his guardian, and felt bound to put
him there, to prevent his making trouble by trying to regain his
kingdom.
This was the time of the railway mania. Muni a new line was
projected. The man who at once took the lead was PONOO.* Dukes
* Editor to Earl.—PONOO! Why, he "s a Sailor; is he "something in the
City " too?
Earl to Editor.—He had a branch establishment at the East End, and so
was, ex offieio. Member of the Stock Exchange and Governor of tbe Bank of
England, don't you know?
Editor to £arl.—0h, all right. You seem to know all about it. Fire
away I
were dying for dividends, and Countesses cringed to him for shares.
He presented twenty-six new railway bills to Parliament every night.
Ouue he had taken the measures of M.P.'s. Now M.P.'s took Ais
measures. He was on the Board of every bubble company floated;
boards and bubbles always float. He became immensely rich; he
talked of nothing but rolling-stock; his very dreams were of sleepers
—this became quite his Permanent Way.
At length he was made Sir PETER PONOO, and shipped off to India
as Governor-General!
CHAPTER THREE.
BBN D'YMION was in Paris, so, of course, TYRA and IRREVALENTA
felt it necessary for their health to go there too.
"BENDY, darling!" said his sister one day, "Why don't you
marry LEONORA? She is ugly, but she is very rich. Early mar-
riages are to be deprecated, 1 know, because they are too frequently-
imprudent. Bat you will be prudent, bless you, I know you wilL
You can't marry too soon, or repent of it too late. Did /hesitate to
marry in order to acquire rank and power?"
"No," replied BEN D'YMION, '' to do you justice, I must say you
didn't hesitate at all."
"You owe everything to LEONORA!" said TYRA.
"I know she lent me twenty thousand," replied her brother ; "but
the debt is not recoverable at law, having been contracted while I
was a minor. Besides, I quite forgot to put a stamp on the receipt,
so"
"Dear boy!" exclaimed the Peeress, and she imprinted an ap-
proving kiss on his ingenuous brow. "It's just like your artless
little ways."
At this moment the Duo de ST. BUNGALOW appeared with a
gorgeously illuminated letter, stamped with a vermilion crown, and
sealed with scarlet wax.
The letter was as follows :—
"MADAM.—I have escaped from the coal-hole, and regained my
kingdom. I have established a firm yet Liberal Government. All
my chief men are either guillotined or in prison. When there is any
disturbance I go out and make a bow. This wins all hearts, 'Til

CHAPTER FOTTB.
BEN D'TMION had to make his first Parliamentary speech. He got
through it pretty well. He only fainted away five times during its
delivery. This was because he felt so dizzy. The Speaker fanned
him with the Mace, and the 8erjeant-at-Arms brought him iced
water in his cocked-hat. The speech was rapturously applauded by
TYBA and IBBEVALBNTA, who were looking in through a skylight:
'twas on the question of the Timbuctoo War, and was a master-
peace. The Prime Minister felt so unable to answer it, that he
resigned.
There was nothing for it but to make BEN D'TMION Prime
Minister 1
IUBEVALENTA called to congratulate him.
"I have some news for you,'1 she said. "You know LEONOBA P"
"LEONOBA 1" echoed BEN D'TMION, rapturously.
"She is engaged to be married to St. SNOBB!"
BEN D'TMION masticated his patrician lip for some moments, and
• Editor to Earl.—That's right! Clear'em off. Isn't this rather sudden,
though?
Earl to Editor.—Oh, yet, 'tis sudden. Such things will happen—especially
towards end of Yol. III. Besides, I must get 'em out of the way for final

"Dearest DTMIB!" said IBKEVALENTA, "if you're thinking of
marrying, Lord MUMTKORD'S fortune was not inconsiderable,
and--"
"Well?" said BEN D'TMION, impatiently.
"'Tis all settled upon me"
"Beauteous creature! What, all t A cool hundred thousand a
year, as I 'm a living Prime Minister. IBBEVALENTA! you shall be
mine!"
_" Them's my sentiments, too," she said. And the peerless Peeress
disappeared in his Titanic arms.

BEN D'TMION to see his old attic in Ratcliff Highway. It was quite
a classical occasion. Let me hear it say its 'ittle cataclysm—I mean

The Prime Minister put his hands meekly behind his back, and
replied, "Whatever it determines on."
"And what is the Whole Duty of Man?"
"To get to the top of the tree."
"Good boy!" said TTBA. And she folded to her breast in a last
embrace the First Lord of the Treasury 1 *

TWELVE! He '11 be blundering home by now, and I 've let the fire burn low,
Along of visions 1 seem to see in the embers' ruddy glow.
Me dream? Well, 1 used to dream of him once, long ago, so long ago!
Ten years! 'Tis a little eternity, and I look so far away,
A girl, with a red ribbon knot in her hair, and a laugh as the laverock gay.
And I 've hardly laughed bince he struck me first, and the roots of my hair are
grey.
At thirty! 'Tisn't the thing I thonght when he left me there at the gate,
With the bit of gold and forget-me-not on my finger. Thounh it was late,
I watched the stars till they faded in dawn,—the stars that to-night I hate!
Look at them glimmerin' coldly there, as lovely as ladies' eyes
When they shine on me out of a smooth, calm faoe, in their beautiful hard
surprise
That all is not right in a world they light. Ah! beauty's the biggest of lies I
I was pretty once, but you can't keep looks in a London alley long;
And he was the smartest lad in the shop—so straight, and square, and strong.
If a man had offered to strike me then, had his lite been worth a song?
But you see when a hand that has fondled once is lifted to bruise and maim,
There's a somethin' snaps in a woman's heart thar, the clever ones may name.
I know it seems bitterer fur than death, and I think it is worse than shame.
Bah I Me whimper ?—the "Missis," old—for my heart is old—and grey,
As though I was nought but that gay soft girl I see so fur away P
Me,—who have fought it with red-faced MOLL, and can toil at the tub all day P
As that rag of curtain shakes in the draught, so I shook when he struck me
first.
It wasn't the pain, though he smote the breast that his bantlings four had nnrst;
But now I am hard as the hand that strikes—and I know not which is worst.
It's the smell <>' that spray o' lay lock there that softens
me so to-night;
A bush of it stood by our cottage gate. I will fling it
away. That's right!
The gin-whiff is better, after all, for in that one can live
—and fight.
But love and flowers are folly, toys for the great ones,
fur as I see.
Why I 'm hardly sure that I love my brats when
they 're clamouring at my knee,
Cry, cry, cry! They 're in bed at last; but when is
there rest for me?
Now, in the silent chill night hours in this squalid stuffy
room?
Waiting my Man, as the "Missis" must, though he linger
till crack o' doom 't—
And he was the lad who kissed me, kissed me under the
laylock bloom.
Rest? When the black thoughts tear my heart, and I
think could I strike one blow
Through his heart and mine as we lay at night, it were
better fur to go.
Bat leave him, leave him to red-faced MOLL, and her
broad-mouth'd laughter P No 1
Sweetheart—Missis! Two wide extremes to touch in
one little year;
The petted darling, the beaten drudge; and the law,

To the starved bread-stealer or straying girl, seems so

It made this ring; ean it do no more in the way o' hind-

Can't it tie a man to the bit o' work, can't it break the

You are pulled it you starve or beat a beast. Are horses

Beaten flesh hardens, and why should souls keep softP
Cold hearts can bear,
Big Ben's a booming—and there's his step a-stumbling
loud on the stair!
A GROWL FROM A KERR.
ONE day last week at the City of London Court, during
the hearing of a disputed claim, Mr. Commissioner KKER
is reported to have said, "Don't talk to me about the
working man. I have a very strong opinion about him,
and that is, that he is one of the greatest impostors
of the day." If the Commissioner alluded to the loafer
who calls himself a working man, the rough who never
has and never wants any work to do, and fellows of that
stamp, he is perfectly right. But the condemnation was
too sweeping. Isn't the Commissioner himself a working
man P Aren't all who honestly lubour in any rank of
life working menP and, above all, aren't journalists
the most hard working, the most hard-worked and
leant complaining of all rightly-called working men P
\Viih these exceptions Commissioner KKUK'H remark is
quite kerr-ect.
Telephone v. Telegraph.
IT must be a painful task for Mr. FATVCETT to appear
as the Champion of a Government Monopoly, and the
Opponent of Scientific Progress. The improvident bargain
made with the Telegraph Companies in 1869 is now bear-
ing bitter fruit. A man who has done no much for his
Department, whose economical principles are above sus-
picion, is compelled to do battle for the worst form of
Protection. The public, as usual, are the sufferers.
Private enterprise would have given them sixpenny
telegrams—the Government charges a shilling. Private
enterprise and human ingenuity will probably supersede
the telegraph, unless burked by a Liberal Government
and a more than Liberal Minister.

IT was Christmas-time in the Land of Queer Fancies, which horders
on the State of Indi-gestion, and Mr. Punch, who had been making;
various purchases of illustrated books, Christmas Cards—"Ds LA
Rtre with a difference," as he observed to himself, chuckling over the
misquotation—and all the illustrated papers, including the Showman,
edited by "CODLIN," with a capital preface by "G. A. 8.," was
wending his way back to his own home, situated on an eminence any
number of thousand feet above the sea, but never over the heads of
the people, among the Heights of Imagination.
™" A Merry Christmas to you I " said a tall man, dressed in an old-
fashioned style.
"Your name's SMITH, I believe," said Mr. Punch, who is en-
dowed with the Royal faculty for remembering names and faces.
"TOM," replied that Gentleman.
"True," returned Mr. Punch • "but one hardly expects anything
true from you, as you are so celebrated for your ' Crackers." You 're
fresher than ever this year. Why don't you call your firm SMiTH
A»D YotwoEB? Capital Fan Costume Crackers, those of yours. Very
ingenious. Good-night. A Merry Christmas to you!, Where's Toby.'"
and he looked about for his faithful follower.
Where was he? Careering far ahead, rolling over and over in the
snow, as jolly a dog as ever was seen—a gay young dog as ever was
heard of, going home for the holidays.
Growing colder and colder. Mr. Punch, in one of hisVwn Dicky-
Doyley wrappers, quickened his pace to increase hit circulation,
starting n«w ideas from their lain at every itep.
Higher and higher Mr. Punch mounted, far from the " madding

crowd," as he drew nearer and nearer to his Shooting-Box, which
is the Noted Half-way House from Everywhere, situated on the
Joke-capped summit of one of the loftiest Heights of the Imaginative
Range. Thicker and thicker lay the snow.
Toby made a point. His tail became violently agitated.
What was that in the snow? A man's head? His boots! Headi
or tails?
To dash at the head—to drag it out, and the body after it, was
with Mr. Punch the work of less than half a second.
"All alive, 0 I" exclaimed the Benevolent Philosopher, cheerily.
And a faint voic« issued from the lips of the man just rescued,—
"All alive, are they? Ah! Ihepesol"

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
The Collective Wisdom of the Humane Society, embodied in their
President, Mr. Punch, at once suggested a good shaking to prevent
a relapse.
"Do yon mean," shouted Mr. Punch in his ear, "that there are
any more of you?"
"Lots I" was the almost inaudible answer.
"Where?"
"In the snow—all about "And he collapsed.
Toby_ was barking furiously. He was finding them, one after the
other, in the snow, just as a dog finds truffles.
In another five minutes eleven frozen-out, speechless, inanimate
travellers were stretched out in as many comfortable arm-chairs before
a roaring fire in Mr. Punch's Hall.
"JOEY!" said Mr. Punch to the faithful old family servant.
"JOEY, bring the flowing bowl, the devilled bones, and the tobacco."
A gentle thrill seemed to vibrate through the eleven frames at the
sound of these magic words. The eleven iced travellers, victims of
a freezing politeness, were gradually yielding to the influence of
genial hospitality.
"They are thawing," cried Mr. Punch in great glee. "Happy
thaw'd! Hot Punch!"
He ladled it down their throats. Coughs and sneezes followed
intermittently in rapid succession, then one exclamation arose from
all lips, "More!!"
"Hooray I they 're ooming-tol" cried the Excellent Philanthropist,
dancing with joy. "Glasses round again! Now a grilled bone!
Cut into it! Hooray I that 'a your sort! How do you find your-
selves now?"
"Where did they find themselves now" seemed likely to be their
first question. Mr. Punch's presence explained that, and then they
insisted on embracing bin. Our Life Preserver!" they cried.
"And now, Gentlemen, as there's plenty more where that comes
from," said Mr. Punch, pointing to the liquor, "we can look for-
ward to a jolly Christmas evening. Hallo I What's this?"
His attention had been suddenly attracted by a Wild-eye'd man,
who was drawing a manuscript from his pocket.
"Oh, I say 1" exclaimed Mr. Punch. But, before he could utter
another word, he saw that all the eleven strangers were pulling
manuscripts from their pockets. Suddenly a light broke in upon
Mr. Punch. "I see," he cried. "You 're the usual get of Tra-
vellers who are always getting lost in the snow, or being shut up
somewhere, or meeting in inns, or haunted houses at Christmas time,
and then each o£you tells a story or sings a song. I know you."
The Wild-eye'd one who had been the first to attract Mr. Punch's
attention, replied as spokesman for the party.
"You are right, as you always are," he said. "We 've brought
all our Stories, and"
"Fill your glasses," said Mr. Punch, bent on making a night of
it. "I won't ask you who you are. Each one can introduce him-
self in turn. And now what's the first article?"
The Wild-eye'd person tossed off half a tumbler of the " mixture
as before," and then read aloud

Time, 10 P.M.
Message suddenly flashed from
Downing Street by special helio-

— Come at once! Dreadful plot!
You must find it out."
10.16 P.M. — I am in Downing

Detective. I leap lightly on to
the roof, and attempt to look down
the chimney. Great difficulty tc
get near it, as the slates crowded
with spies, eavesdroppers, emis-
saries, Irish landlords, Turkish
bondholders, Greek and Monte-
negrin patriots, all interested in
finding out the Government's in-
tentions.
I slid down the chimney. Half-
way I was wedged in by a Russian
spy. He was going up. "There
is a plot," he whispered, as he passed upwards and disappeared.
The next moment I was in the Premier's room. He was reading
aloud a poem called The (Boy) Cotter's Saturday Night.
"What answer shall I send BOYCOTT?" asked the Secretary,
venturing to interrupt his Chief.
"Answer?" returned the Premier, testily, "write 'Mind your
own business' on a postcard, and send him that."

All sure there is one, however. Premier says Kurds are at the

a finger in it. Mr. CHAMBERLAIN fancies it a plot of the Whigs to
prevent reform in Land Laws. Earl GHANVTLLE said he was sure
:ho Americans were conspiring about Fishery question. Mr. BRIGHT
jeginning to remark that as there were no lords or kings in America,
there couldn't possibly be a plot of any kind there. I cautiously
inquired if the Plot was there? No. Aha! then I had found the

PENZANCE disguised as OLIVER CROMWELL, spade in hand, shovel-
ling earth out of a large hole which he has just made.
He throws down his implements, and says, "I am dressed as
CBOMWELL, and am digging a hole for CHARLES."
12.30 P.M. — House of Lords deserted, except by a single occu-
pant. Lord SHERBROOKE sitting on a shelf, high up, looking very
much changed.
"My Lord!" I said, taking out one of my blank forms of arrest;
I arrest you on a charge of prtemunire, scire facias, caveat emptor,

"I'm not the man," he whispered, "try BRIGHT. "We're

I wrote the information down in my pocket-book. Two men
whispered, "Try Colney Hatch." I started for my destination. _ I
was wandering in my mind towards the Heights of Imagination
when I lost my way in the snow and you found me.
"All right!" eaid Mr. Punch, nodding to the Detective. "Keep quiet."
"Stands Scotland-Yard where it did?" asked a sombre-yisaged person who
subsequently introduced himself as an Un-blighted Tragedian.
"Well, I don't know," replied the Detective. "I don't like speaking
against my own profession, but what do you think of this, eh?" and he read
out—

Cf)t aHii-blugfttrti Crajjrtuan.
You will wonder why you have found me buried in an avalanchei
ready dressed for Hamlet. 1 will tell you:—
I am the eldest son of a Duke, and heir, in direct succession to a
couple of the wealthiest peerages in the three kingdoms. I was not
'' born " to the stage. The Duchess, my mother,: 1 u»d nourished a vast
ambition for my future. She had said to my father, the Duke, "I
am resolved about PLANTAGENET: he shall lead both parties in both
Houses." My father had nodded approvingly, as he always did, and
merely rejoined, "Very well, my dear; just as you like, of course."
After this I began well. Cabinet Ministers were asked down to
Boltons, and were hurried up to the nursery six at a time to look
at me iu my cradle. My earliest recollections are of nothing but
crowned heads. At three and twenty, I was one of the acknow-
ledged listeners of the House, had written a standard work on
Blank Cheques, and was set down for a Junior Secretaryship. My
reputation was European—at least, almost European. And now
came the turning-point of my existence.
A literary Marquis had given me an order for two to the upper
boxes, for a matinee at the Jung's Cross Theatre. I had never
entered a play-house before. The piece was A Wolf in Sheep's
Clothing. The hero spoke as if his mouth was full of potatoes.
The heroine seemed on familiar terms with the leader of the band.
But the blow was struck. The splendour of the whole thing seized on
me like a mighty revelation. I felt, in an instant, that till now I
had not known the meaning of that mysterious word "career."
That very night. I saw the Prime Minister, and threw up everything I
might have held. There was a scene, but I was obdurate. Within a
week, I had been thoroughly prepared for the stage by an experienced
advertiser. At the end of a fortnight, I .had been driven from

fell to another. At home,
however, there was no lack
of energy. A Clown and
Pantaloon were asked down
for the Grouse Shooting',
and the whole of the dip-
lomatic corps were invited
to meet them. Nor did
matters end here. All the
back numbers of the Era,
from its commencement
were left about in piles
on the drawing - room

Essex coast. It was about this time, that my father received
the Garter, and for a fortnight I was "wanted" in the second
column of the Times by the family Solicitor. But I had chosen my
career. My father was welcome to the Garter. Give me the Orders!
To play Hamlet before a moderate house, that should not be more
than three-fourths paper, was still the dream of my existence.
So I kept my counsel. While they were in mourning for me at
Boltons, I was working the tail of the "Merry Mastodon" in a
burlesque that had been
written by a local poet at
Herne Say, and had run
a whole night and a half.
Once, and only once, I got
a chance with Hamlet. It
was at a place where some-
how, they had not yet
heard of my name. And
I was getting on fairly,
when the Ohost suddenly
staggered on to the stage,
and I saw at a glance that
he had been following the
Danish custom, more non-
oured in the breach than
the observance, and was,
in fact, stupidly drunk.
Fortunately experience had
taught me what to do, and,

to the black bag and said, "My secret is locked in that bag, and

say. I was the heir to a Dukedom and a Garter." "Only one"
said I. "No," said he, "both; and also to immense estates and
large sums of money, thousands of acres and tens of thousands of
pounds. The only living being that stood between me and my large
inheritance is here, here," and he pointed to the black bag. I
thought I should have fainted with "error. "But," I said, "how

my "ten minutes interlude" of "Feeding the Beasts at the Zoo

"Consummate!" sighed an Esthetic Young Man, who had been found in the inow with
a Lily in hie hand, and a Peacock's Feather behind hit ear.
"Mr. POSTLBTHWAITB, I believe?" said Mr. Punch, bowing.
The ./Esthetic gracefully acknowledged the salutation, and relapsed into silence.
"The world's a stage, Sir, as you say," observed a sad-looking, middle-aged Man, in
reply to some remark from the Un-blighted Tragedian; "but it's the unprofesaionals who
have most experience of its tragedy."
Mr. Punch requested the Sad Traveller to oblige him by reading the manuicript which
he had already produced.
"It *« in verse," said the Sad Traveller. "And I call it"
!
"Th«n hei^h-ho, the holly!
This life is moat jolly."—SIIAKH-KAUK.
THB holly was full of berry, this winter was hard
and white,
As white as my girl-wife's face, and as hard as our
life's long fight.
"It will sell all the better," she said, as she kissed
me a faint good-bye.
And I (fathered the scant rags round her, and went,
with a tear-dimmed eye.
No fire in the rusted grate; chill cheer for our
Christmas Eve I
And I left her, to wheel out the holly, though
bitterly loth to leave.
It was brought from the far white woods, near the
Cottage where POLLY was born,
Twenty long miles I had trudged with it, only that
same bleak morn.
But the shining red berries were thick on it, show-
ing so ruddily warm,
That I left iust one scarlet spray on her pillow. Her frost-pinched form
Shook 'neath the tattered quilt; but she said. "I feel cosy and well.
And I never saw holly so fine, Toit; 'twill sell, dear, I'm sure it will sell."
Sell 1 'Twas but little 'twould fetch, though it sold to the last red spray.
But what other chance of comfort was left for our Christmas Day?
A shilling or two meant dinner, a bit of fire in the stove,
And POLLT clasped warm in my arms, —yes warm as our sore tried lore.
Ah 1 if only love could warm, spite of frost and of clothing scant,
Could keep off the biting of winter, the gnawing of hunger and want,
Then the cold had never
struck home through the
thin, thin rags of my wife,
Nor consumption's merciless
clutch have been laid on
the core of her life.
The streets were white, but
the gaslight gleamed from
a myriad jets
On a myriad eager faces; e'en
poverty's fevers and frets
Seemed stilled, or they stole
into corners, like bats
when the daylight breaks;
"What have holiday buyers
to do with the vision of
hungers and aches P
"Holly-ho! llolly-ho!
Holly-ho!" Oh, I shouted
and smiled with the best,
And I chaffed with the jovial
chafferers, — longing for
midnight and rest.
And an old stave ran in my
head, about life being
jolly, most jolly,
As I looked on the girls' rosy
faces, and thought of the
white cheeks of FOLLY.
Yet the pennies came slowly in; but, at last, when the throne had grown thin,
There passed me a portly old fellow, wool-swathed to his round red chin.
Was he caught by the gleam of the berries,—my face's oold trouble r1 Who
knows P
But he turned, and he bought the whole lot. "What a laugh to my lips arose!
""Wheel it home to my house, my good man." And I followed him home
through the night.
As clean as his smooth shaven face, was the Villa, all comfort and light;

And his daughters thronged to the hall, and they kissed
him, and welcomed the holly;
And again in my ears rang the cheery old strain, "Life
is jolly, most jolly 1"
"Well, with six shining shillings in hand, wine-warmed,
with a flask "for my wife."
It was hardly for me to be bitter, or mock at the landers
of life.
The thought of the glisten of POLLY'S dark eyes drew me
on, hot and swift,
Till my scant breath failed, and I reeled, as the latch I
was ready to lift.
One minute I paused on the threshold; I think that my
thought was a prayer,
A wordless thanksgiving for her whd was waiting so
patiently there.
Hist I "Was that her low voice P "Ton.1" Aye, I
heard it close at my ear,
The voice of the girl I had wo&ed in the holly wood,
wondrously faint and clear.
And I burst in. singing the strain, "Oh, this life is jolly,
most jolly I"
"It is Christmas morning, my girl, and I 've sold every
bit of our holly,
Save the spray on your pillow, my pet. Let me kiss
your poor cheeks as red."
And I stooped, with my heart at my lips, almost happy,
—and POLLY was dead 1
Three minutes allowed for reflection, which was, however,
interrupted by Toby rushing in with something in his mouth.
"That dog is very troublesome," said Mr. Punch, apologeti-
cally. "One moment, Gentlemen," and he took up a roll of
paper off the rug.
"The last Turkish Circular Note," he explained to the com-
pany, after perusing the document. "Will anyone cash it f"
There was a quiet laugh, but no one made an offer.
'Into the fire with it," said the business-like host. "And
now, once more go on, if you please. Who 's next t"
'I be !" cried a sturdy-looking Fellow, in velveteen.
'And what's your paper about ?" inquired Mr. Punch. .
'Well, Zur, it be better nor Playactors' ghoaeties—it bo about

read out

had begun to fall, and by the time 'a got whoam 'a was as white all

wi' holes for eyes, nose, and mouth, like the Man i' the Moon, and
by way of beautif yun the Ghoast's peepers in partickler, stuck bits o'
green glass in um, which made um look all the moor soopernateral.
0' course, I needn't ezplaain who 'twas that hid hisself behind
the Ghoast in the holler tree, and gied the horrable groan, and sud-
duntly doused the glim in the turmut lantern.
"Why, you jolly old 'umbug!" exclaimed the Irrepressible One. "That
wasn't a ghost! I don't believe in ghoats," said 'ARttY. POSTLETHWAITB
heaved a sigh.
"I do," said the Un-blighted Being; "SHAKSPBAHK did."
Some of the company rose at once to dispute this position, but before
Mr. Punch had decided who was to speak first, Toby rusbed in head over
heels, barking furiously.
"I can't help it, Master," yelled Toby in his best dog-Latin, which his
master translated for the company's benefit; "but there are three Gentlemen
outside, who want to know whether you'll subscribe a trine to the Land
League."
"With the greatest pleasure!" instantly responded the Just and Generous
Sage, his eye twinkling. "What, ho! without there! Start an avalanche!"
There was a ro»r of thunder. "Now, Gentlemen," ha said, smiling cheerily,
"that 'i disposed of. Perhaps Mr. POSTLETHWAITB will oblige?"
The ./Esthetic Young Man rose languidly from his seat, and leaning against
a bookcase, with the Lily in his hand, and the Peacock's Feather in his hair,
he read aloud
jfleur toes SUpes;
OR, POSTLETHWAITE'8 LAST LOVE.
GOOD Philistines all, I don't carry manuscripts about me to read
to the likes of you I and if I did, you couldn't understand them—and
if you could, I should be Supremely disgusted,—moreover, you would
have the advantage of me.
But I can speak plain English when it suits me, and make myself
pretty well understood, when I like—even by such as yourselves—
wherefore, since you are willing to listen, I will tell you why I am
here to-night, far, far away from the CIMABITE BROWNS—remote, ah
me I from the tender companionship of my MATJDLE!
You have never heard of MATOLE and Mrs. CIMABITE BBOWN? I
dare say not. To know them is a Joy .and the privilege of a select
and chosen few; for they are simply Perfect. Yet in their respec-
tive perfection, they differentiate from each other with a quite
ineffably subtle exquisiteness.
For She is Supremely Consummate—whereas He is Consummately
Supreme. I constantly tell them so, and they agree with me.
I also make a point of telling everybody else.
My modesty prevents me from revealing to you all they tell me
(and everybody else) about myself, beyond the mere fact that they
consider me alone to combine, in my own mind and person, Supreme
Consummateness with Consummate Supremacy—and I agree with
them. We get on uncommonly well together, I can tell yon.
It will not surprise you, seeing that lam thus gifted, to hear that
for the last year or two I have been quite a Social Celebrity. It
happened in this wise.
One evening, for want of anything better to say, I told Mrs. CIMABUE
BBOWN, in the strictest confidence, that I could sit up all night with
a Lily. She was holding one in her hand, as usual. She was deeply
moved. Her eye moistened. She said, "Quite so!" and wrung my
fingers. And it struck her as such a beautiful thought, that she
couldn't help letting it out before that blundering buffoon GBIOSBY,
who always tries to poke his vulgar fun at MATOLE and myself;
and GRIOSBY went and told it to every soul he knew, at a good
joke against Me!
Now GBIQSBY, for some reason or other that I could never make
out, knows everybody worth knowing, and everybody worth knowing
very naturally wanted to know a man who could sit up all night
with a Lily I
A Lily! Just think of it, ye worthy Philistines! what a flower to
have chosen! and for what a purpoae! How Consummate I How
Perfect! how Supreme, Precious and Blessed! Nay, how Utter 1
I became the fashion. These very adjectives of mine have grown
into household words. Even GBIOSBY uses them now, and.about me

of all people; me, whom he pretends to hate! For does he not call me,
and to my very face, too, a Supreme duffer, a Consummate ass, a
Blesse'd idiot, a Precious fool, a Perfect noodle, nay, an Utter Nin-
compoop I
Poor GHIOSBT! What an utter sell for him! But he lacks the
real sense of humour 1
I had imitators, of course. I can hardly call them rivals. PILCOI
declared he could sit up all night with a Stephanotis—and actually
did so, I believe, and was seedy for a month in consequence I And
as for MILKINOTON SOPLEY, he swore he never went to bed without
an Aloe Blossom I a thing that only happens once in a century I
They overdid it. They always do. And GRIGSBY lets them alone.
Next season I took MAT/DLE aside, and whispered to him (in the
hearing of GBIGSBY) that I had sat up all night with a Primrose. I
thought it a capital change after the Lily. So simple, you know I
And we all went in for simplicity just then, even the little CIMABT/E
BROWNS 1 And what a sell for PILCOI and SOPLET, with their Aloe
Blossoms and Stephanotises 1
A tear rolled down the Perfect cheek of MATTDLK (for his cheek is
almost as consummate as mine); pressing me to hii bosom he said,
"Distinctly so!" GRIOSBT let off a big D., and went forth like an
indignant lamb to spread the news abroad.
It took immediately; the people worth knowing (GBIOSBT'S people,
Hal Ha!) literally fought for me— GHIGSBY was nowhere.
PILCOI followed suit with a Marigold, or a Dandelion, or some such
twaddling superannuated old weed. And SOPLET, poor boy I tried it
on with a Snowdrop, so he said: but it was in June, you know, and
didn't do at all. They overdid it, as usual, and were out of it again 1
The fact is, "they ain't got no Tack," as GRIOSBY says when he
wants to be funny. And as for the sense of humour, they are as
badly off as GBIOSBY himself. Besides which, PILCOX gets his clothes

ready-made at KPHKALM BROTHERS, in the Strand, or somewhere.
And SOIT.KY can't bear up against a snub from a lady of title. It
upsets his stomach, and he goes home and tells his mother and
Bisters—and they tell everybody all round. Fatal!
Now the Lily had carried me though my first season, the Primrose
through my second. The question arose: what Flower of Flowers is
to carry me through my next? It must be simpler than the Prim-
rose, rarer than the Lily, and as consummate and all that as either;
and such, moreover, as to rile Gitinsnr to madness, and leave SOPLEY
and PILCOX sticking in the mud for the rest of their lives.
I sat up all night with a Botanical Dictionary, and hit upon the
very flower at last—The Utter Blossom I The Perfect Thing II Oh,
my GHIGSBY.! It will be the death of yon! And yon. Professional
Beauties, look well to your laurels! For this is a stroke of Genius,
and will carry me on to 1883—or even '41
And that is why I am here to-night.
Good Philistines, every one, you are the witnesses thereof—and
when called upon to do so (by GBIGSBT, for instance), must testify
to the fact that I, .1 KT.LAUY POSTLETH WAITK, was actually caught,
by an intelligent little quadruped answering to the name of Toby—
who informed his friend the big dog Chang of the fact, and Chang
carried me hither—in a snowstorm at mid-winter, nine thousand feet
above the level of the sea, Lat. 45' 52' N., Long. 7* 127 E., under most
unfavourable circumstances, and at considerable personal risk and
inconvenience to myself, in the very act of
SITTING UP ALL NIGHT WITH AN EDELWEISS!
Here the -Esthetic POSTLETHWAITS produced a dried specimen, smelt it
passionately, and fainted away. Punch revived him. Three sniffa did it.
Then Toby asked penni.-aion to entertain Cluing with grilled bones and por-
ridge before the kitchen fire. "By all means!" said Sir. Punch, heartily.
"Don't twig this lingo about 'Consummate,'" said 'AHKY. BOBBBT the
Waiter thought it had something to do with soup.
"Look here, Guv'nor," cried the Irrepressible to Mr. Punch. "Tip us a
stave yourself!'
"Hear! Hear!
replied the Sage,
a present from 01
his portfolio a Christmas Cartoon.
"Here we are again!" they all called out as they read the title.
"Yes," returned Mr. Punch; "and here he is again—Father Christmas,
the Friend of all—young and old! There is also, you will observe," he
added, blushing slightly, "a somewhat flattering portrait of myself. I like
being among the children at Christmas time. So fill your glasses a bumper.
Gentlemen, if you please, and here 's the health of the bairns, bless 'em! And

Cfortsftmas,
Do you hear the children laughing,—fathers, mothers,—
Ere the sorrows come with years?
They are romping all together, sisters, brothers,
And they little know of tears.
The snow may be lying on the meadows,
The world with cold grief may be opprest;
The East may not be free from boding shadows,
Fresh trouble may be brewing in the West:
But the young, young children, 0 my brothers I
They are laughing merrily;
They are laughing, knowing nought of bills and bothers,
And from care and taxes free.
They look up with their bright and beaming faces,
And their looks are good to see,
And the vision of their infantile glad graces
Fills their Punch't heart with glee.
"The world," they seem to say, "is bright and cheery."
They wear its best of roses on each cheek;
And the sight of their fine rapture rests the weary,
And the music of their mirth inspires the weak.
Let us all be glad, and frolic with the children,
Though the outer world look cold;
Let us listen to their prattle, loud, bewildering,
And forget we 're growing old.
For " 0!" cry the children, " he is coming,
Father Christmas, he is here!"
The glories of his advent they are summing,
And his gifts and his good cheer.
Here is Christmas! As the children rush to greet him,
Mr. Punch, the children's friend, is midst their throng,
Father Christmas! Let us welcome him and meet him,
Like the children, with a jest and with a song.
There '11 be lots of serious work to do to-morrow,
But to-day is Christmas Day,
So a lesson from the children let us borrow—
Laugh, and frolic, and be gay!

hearty applause which followed their host s verses had subsided; "I'm fond

leach-m-the-East, and a member—I may say a very active member
—of the Conglomerated Board of Works.
I got my nose into parochial business, and where my nose wenl
my body goon followed. I soon mastered the theory and practice oi
parochial politics. I was rewarded by being made a Local Pole-
Tax Commissioner. From this moment my building transactions
increased in the most marvellous manner. I was sent to represent
my District at the Conglomerated Board of Works. I soon under-
stood my colleagues, and they understood me. I had many friends
who bought land, leaseholds, freeholds, shops, and houses. It was
curious that these places were always wanted by the Conglomerated
Board for Babylonian Improvements. Not wishing to stand across
the path of progress, they sold their property to the public, and
bought other property. The same result followed. They were still
in the path of progress.
I should probably have done wisely if I had merely acted as
looker-on at these transactions, but my charity carried me away.
The line of the Mammoth Thoroughfare required an opening right
across a particular street, and the centre of the line was occupied by
a large old lop-sided house which was in the possession of a fat,
good-humoured Italian, named SPAHGHETTI, who devoted the base-
ment to the manufacture and sale of penny ices. SPAGHETTI'S
stock-in-trade was not imposing. A few glasses, a few lemons, a
rusty copper, and some cracked marble tables. Even these were not
his own, but heavily rented from a hungry-looking German who
dealt in old clothes, fried tish, oranges, money-lending, and cheap
jewellery. I quietly established myself as SPAIIGHETTI'S patron,
mnch to the disgust of the German. I did the house up in a showy
Mai?e u turned a 8ma11 wax-work exhibition out of the first-floor,
illed the rooms with packing-cases and a few boxes of macaroni
and put up a substantial crane outside the building. This gave us
a '"j'10 u a . l°°k. ^ome old- account-books, a small counting-house,
and other signs of trade prepared us decently for our heavy claim for
compensation.
We sent it in, hacked by figures and the testimony of experts, and
large as it was, we should have got it if it had not been for the
?.?!?, Gn!rman and a new looal Journal called The Houndsditch
Aettle. The waspish German supplied what he was pleased to call
tacts, and the Nettle served them up with additions and comments.
1 was compelled to support the NsttU, and vote against myself. The
compensation was reduced to a ridiculous sum, just sufficient to pay
He tor the alteration of the premises, and leaving a balance of about
in pounds, which I handed to the now houseless SPAEGHETTI. The
Houseless SPABGHETTI would have been quite content with this sum,
t nis ear had not been poisoned by the waspish and revengeful
German. He was persuaded that he had been swindled, and tha
his Italian honour demanded vengeance. ~ He began to dog my foot
steps; he glared at me from doorways, he muttered threats in a
language I could not understand. If I entered an omnibus, hi
followed me; if I tried a river steamboat or the Underground Rail
way, he was still my companion. I was afraid to claim the protec
tion of the police. I could hardly appear in court against him. _
thought to evade him by trying a foreign tour, and purchased on
of COOK'S Circular Tickets to go anywhere and everywhere—but '.
was mistaken. He turned up as a courier or interpreter, and was
still near me. A fortunate accident at last came to my relief. Hi
passport was out of order, and at the top of the Alps he was no
allowed to descend into his native country. He was sent down again
into France to get his proper credentials; and here 1 am, a warnin)

And by the way. I only hope your dog won't find that eonfoundec

At the conclusion of the Overseer's Story, a Gentleman of military appear-
ance, requested permission to be allowed to ask the company a question, which
he called "A Case of Uniformity."—Q. Why does the Duke of CAMBRIDGE
wish his Officers to appear at all times in scarlet ?—A. Because he wants
them to act up to the spirit of the motto of the British Army—"Ready, ay<
ready.'"
"What the Duke said," observed Mr. Punch, "was, if I remember rightly
'Officers shall in future wear uniform, save when engaged in recreation.'
"Then," rejoined the Military-looking Gentleman, "the question is—What
is Recreation'( Is it Recreation to drink brandies and sodas, smoke cigarettes
and relate anecdotes of a possibly hilarious but certainly questionable character
every afternoon in a Bond Street hotel, frequent second-rate race meetings
and mix with light-weight jockeys and stable lads of considerably lower rank
and education than your own servants, in the hope of getting a 'straight tip?
Is it Recreation to take Miss GUINEVERE BE CANCAN, of the Tooral-Looral
Theatre, to the Derby f Is it }" Here the Irrepressible interrupted the
speaker with—" Give it up. Ask another." The Military-looking Gentle-
man was evidently about to retort somewhat violently, when Mr. Punch
invited his guests to clink glasses amicably all round.
"Good tipple this, Sir," said a Jolly-looking Young Man. "But there'»
a lot drunk about this time that isn't. I speak as a Medical Student—or, I
should say, I sing as on«." And he at once trolled out

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
"Ah," said an old Man, in a corner, " drink 'a different to what
it were. Everything's different."
"Who are you, my worthy friend t" asked Mr. Punch, with a
warm tear glistening in his sympathetic eye.
"I am the Old Happy Peasant," answered the Ancient Man.
"I 've done a lot o' magazine work in my time, and I 've got a little
•tory here in my pocket, which I call"
WntoUi Calf*

REAL English Christmas weather! Above, a heavy
grey sky, without a cloud. A pitiless, pelting rain, which
the keen East wind sweeps across the fields. Below, mnd
thick and grimy.
Round about the fire on the Christmas Eve of which my
tale tells, was a group characteristic of an English village.
First and foremost cornea mine host. His small eyes, set
close together, his fiery and inflamed nose, his beetle-brows,
bis low forehead, his heavy jowl, combined to make him a
regular jolly English sort of landlord, in whose house you
would at once feel at home if you had previously been in
the habit of lodging free of charge at any of Her Majesty's
many public buildings. On his right sat CLIFFORD SINN,
the lawyer who did all the village business. He had been
struck off the Rolls in London, but at Slushley, nobody knew
exactly what this meant, and regarded it as some profes-
sional distinction. Near him again sat JACK SVTADDT, who
had been a soldier.
When JACX SWADDT, driven to desperation by the Squire's
game-keepers, ran away and enlisted, the big bells were
rung, and bonfires were burnt .to celebrate the delight the
village felt at sending such a hero forth into the world.
And whenever it was reported that a British regiment was
surrounded by fierce and unconquerable enemies, whenever
it was rumoured that the British army had been decimated
on the field, and that the survivors had suffered the most
hideous tortures, old men, and women, lads and lasses, foil
on their knees, and devoutly prayed that JACK SWADDY
might be in the midst of it. He returned after seven years'
absence, with his hair cut very short, evidently in the mili-
tary fashion, and a military way of lifting his feet high from
the ground, as if, for seven years, he had been trying to go
up an endless staircase.
The other inmates of the cosy parlour must be passed
over quickly. Here sat the Doctor, one of the most famous
unqualified practitioners in England ; there sat the Parish
Clerk, half blind and stone deaf; there sat the sporting
Farmer, who had once run a horse at a suburban meeting,
and had come home with two black eyes, and no front teeth
to _ speak of: there sat the Butcher, who was complacently
pointed out by the villagers to the lew .strangers who ever
visited Slushley, as the man who was owed more money
than the Landlord; and there, in the corner, sat old Gaffer
NORTON. What Gaffer NORTON'S age was, no one knew.
He once stated he was over a hundred, but when his son,
who was himself seventy, proposed to put him in a cart,
and show him round the country at so much a head, he
averred, with tears in his eyes, that he was only five-and-
thirty. However, all agreed lie was very old.
"So," said mine host," Christmas isupon us oncemore like."
"Aye,sewerly,"replied SWADDT, "theydusaay 'cooming,
and so is Christmas;' but a 've noticed that Christmas, he
doee come, whether he will or no."
Marvellous, it is indeed," remarked Gaffer NORTON, "he aleays do come
as Master SWADDT has said. A am an old man, but a remember Christmas
coming ivery year that a 've been born."
"There now, there now, d'ye hear ?" said the Butcher; "was there ever
the likes of such a memory as thic theer man possesses f He never forgets
that Christmas comes every year."
"And every year the ghost of Lady MART," said the Surgeon, "walks
on the terrace of the Hall."
"Uncommon wet night for her," sneered CLIFFORD SINN.
"But a'm uncommon dray," replied SWADDT, at which no one laughed,
for each had meant to say it himself. The hint, however, was taken, and
the glasses having been replenished with foaming quassia, and log-wood,
and oil of vitriol, according to taste, mine host recommenced.
"Tell ns all about the Ghost, Gaffer," said mine host, for he knew the
story was long, and required much moistening.
"Aye, that a will with all pleasure."
At this announcement more than half the company left the room, and
went away not to return.
"You may see," commenced the Gaffer, "that a were coming over the
fields wan naight, five-and-fifty years ago, right adown by what they call
Stokes End"
"Was you sober ?" asked the Butcher.
"A were," replied the Gaffer.
The Butcher sighed as if the interest of the tale as far as he was
concerned had departed. So he departed himself.
"A were thaat sober, that a didn't know it were Christmas Eve at all.
And a sees a light on the terrace o' the Squaire. And a was mortually
fraightened. A am but a poor wambling old man, and had a raight to be
terrified."
"But," broke in SWADDT, "you wasn't a wambling old man then, though
you are now."
"A 've always told this story the same way."
"And a 've always said that it was wrong in the same way too: and a 've
gone home, and a'm going home now," and SWADDT with his high stepping
action passed out into the night.
"Let him bide, let him bide. A were mortually fraightened."
"You 've said that before. I can't stop here all night hearing yon saying
the same thing over and over again," said CLIFFORD SINN. "I am off now,*'
and CLIFFORD SINN departed.
"And a said what prayers a could remember. A shrieked out' Amen !''
"There will be no service here next Sunday," shouted the Clerk, awoke
by the familiar sound. And he immediately went home under the impression
that he had been to church.
"And the ghosty said to me, 'Gaffer NORTON, Gaffer NORTON, there is
treasure in the field behind the ' Jolly Cockchafer.'"
Mine .host slipt out noiselessly, and catching up a spade, set to work to
dig up his field with all the vigour he possessed.
"But first of all you must mind Why, where's everyone agone to?
Why, a do declare they've left a pore wambling old man all by himself. This
is what they call manners. In my young days we sat around at Christmas,
and told each other lies, and believed them; but naow "And Gaffer
NORTON drank up what was left in the glasses of the departed, and with
difficulty sought his couch, vehemently, if inarticulately, abusing modern
Christmas ways and fashions.
"Well, that's no end of a Story, that is!" cried the Irrepressible. "Bother your
old country places in winter! They 're a fraud. Look 'ere! Just see what I wrote to

I was out of it, jolly clean out
Offered to tip 'em a song,
''La-di-da," or " O, isn't it Spicy," but bless

But FLO looked so pooty in pink.

and tipped her my haffablest wink.
She stared, but took hold of my arm, and
her dancing was really A 1,
Not half enough fling in it, though; so says
I, "Let's go in for some fun.
And I carted 'er round, a rare breather, a
taste of my werry best form;
And when we pulled up she looked proper, so

Then I tipped 'em a song, a top-row one.
oh trust me! "Ah, where are we now?1'
Thinks I. But the Joskins were jealous; the
girls didn't twig it, somehow;
And I couldn't fix FLO for a waltz, and the
mizzletoe bizness fell flat,
And though they seemed jolly as sand-boys,
J somehow dropt out after that.
FLO danced with JACK BATES all the even-
ing,—no manners in rustics, dear boy,—
And songs of the wishy-wabh border was
what they seemed most to enjoy.
Fact is I was far too good form for 'em; none of 'em up to my pace,
And your Cads always do git the needle as soon as they 're out of the race.
The mizzletoe game I cut clean. Well, I did condescend to try FLO,
But that blessed JACK BATES — clumsy clown — got 'is foot in the way, don't you know,
And I came sech a doose of a cropper, it quite put my nose out of model,
So I says, "Oh ! this isn't quite good enough. Tip me my 'dip,' and / '11 toddle."
My dignerty dashed 'em a bit. But they kep it up late all the same,
And you 'd think, from the shindy they raised, they were 'avin' a proper old game.

"Here 's another!" barked Toby, dragging in somebody by the collar of his rough ulster.
Placed before the fire, and plied with punch, the New Arrival thawed instantly. There was a remark-
able twinkle in his eye as he drew forth from one pocket a quaint, old-fashioned clay pipe of the On AKLES
THE SECOND period, and from another a roll of paper.
"A manuscript, of course," observed Mr. Punch, placidly. He was becoming accustomed to them.
"No, my dear old friend," replied the Newly-found One. But, before he could utter another word,
Mr. Punch had seized him by the hands and was shaking them heartily.
"A manuscript!" exclaimed Mr, Punch, beaming, " of course not! It 's a picture! Is it one of Our
Piople .»"
"No," answered the Artist, winking confidentially as he filled his pipe, " it only illustrates an event in
the generally unromantic life of poor old STODOB, which, as it had better have a title, I will call "-
WHEN STODGE was younger than he is now, he was entirely dependent on his Aunt. If he
did anything contrary to her wishes, she wouldn't leave him a farthing. STODGE fell in love.
Aunt didn't approve. STODGE determined to marry without her knowledge. As a young man he
had an enormous beard, black as a coal. He started by the night- train to visit his intended.

To his horror, he saw his Aunt enter the carriage. _ Always an ingenious and ready-witted
man, STODGE had turned his beard up right over his face, crammed down his hat, and fixed it
so that only his nose and eyes were visible. When she saw him, the Old Lady, who was of
Northern extraction and slightly superstitious, thought it must be Auld Clootie himself, gave
a shriek, and fainted.
On coming to herself and the next station, she saw her nephew—undisguised of course—
leaning over her, and reviving her with a welcome flask. In burning accents he told her how
he had dashed into the carriage at the risk of his life, had grappled with a masked villain.
just as he was in the combined acts of robbing and_ murdering her all at once, had pitched
him out of the carriage and saved her life. Imagine the old Lady's gratitude! She con-
sented to the marriage, and STODGE is now a rich man, amusing himself by painting bad
pictures, and giving good dinners. He gets praised for both by those who frequently come
to the latter.
Scarcely had the Artist resumed his seat, ere Toby dashed in. "What is it now ?" asked Mr. Punch.
"Please, Master," replied the intruder promptly, " it's a Policeman, outside in the snow, who has been
trying to induce me to steal a leg of mutton from the larder. He wants to get up a case."
"Push him over the precipice," said Mr. Punch, severely.
"Yes, by all means,'' chimed in the Detective. Toby went out to see the order and the offender duly
executed.
"Another glass, Gentlemen! Tou won't go home till morning!" cried Mr. Punch, as heartily as ever.
"Not till morning?" exclaimed the Military-looking Gentleman, "then here's my manuscript"—

so much wealth, and he looked round to see
if there were any Pashas within hail, so
that he might give them orders for my
immediate murder.
"No you don't!" I observed, drawing
out three revolvers. I held one in each
hand, and carried the other in my mouth.

GOING FOB THE RISE.
It was a habit I contracted amongst the
Zulus.
The SULTAN apologised for his gauchtrie,
and wept upon my shoulder, explaining
that as a child ho had been perfectly
guileless, but that advancing years had
ruined what had once been a really beauti-
ful character.
"Bedad! Hurrool" at last he exclaimed. "What '11 yon give for a joke about Greek
craft in Turkish waters?"
"Won't do I" I replied; and hurried oS at once to Berlin. BISMABCK was only too glad
to have my company. He began a long rigmarole about what he called his policy.
"Stop that nonsense," I cried somewhat sharply. "I have more serious matters to think
of. Give me one of your clever epigrams to take back to England. Quick 1"
Btsu \HCK smoked a pound of tobacco, and tossed olf a gallon of beer. Having done this,
he broke out into peals of laughter.
"I have the very thing for you!" he cried. "The very thing I and all out of my own
head." Then as I took out my note-book he dictated, "When is a door not a door? When
it is a-jar I" I jumped up furiously.
The Prince's mirth on seeing this was immediately changed into alarm.
"I meant no harm, indeed I didn't," he whimpered. "I own
it is not mine. I haven t got one by me. I 've only made one about
1 Blood and Iron.' The ' Door a-jar' was given to me by Lord
BEACONSFIELD, who declared that the joke was one of his own!"
Disgusted at having wasted my time on such a fool's errand,
I started for St. Petersburg.
"I am really delighted to have your company," observed the
CZAR, as we blew up together with a chandelier through the roof
of the Winter Palace. "Don't be alarmed! We shall come
down by-and-by. We are only on the top of an explosion contrived
by the Nihilists. I ascend in this manner about a dozen times a
day, like a captive balloon, and find the fresh air up above simply
delightful." I explained to his Majesty what I wanted.
The Autocrat of all the Ilussias suggested that he could give
me a local joke about the Livadia on the Neva, "Neva too late,"
&c. I informed him that it had been done before. After that—but
Here the Special suddenly stopped, looked at his watch, and exclaiming "Six o'clock! Must be off!
Special business! A Merry Christmas!" he seized a bicycle, and placing it dexterously on one of the
telegraph wires that were now fast appearing through the thawing snow, uaing this narrow path as a
road, he disappeared in the distance!
"Six!" exclaimed everybody. The sun. rising early on the Heights of Imagination, was beaming
with red-faced joviality. And what a change outside the House! Why, tho sun himself was hardly
wanted, so thoroughly had the warmth of Mr. Punch's reception melted,the snow all round, leaving, how-

poetically-inspired snow ought to be.
Everyone felt the better for the nicht wi' Punch, even POSTLBTHWAITB, who sighed, and said it had

ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
The Stock Exchange.
O many "Dnloigno Seventy - per -
Cents " hod been left me by an aged
female relative, that I wanted to hear
"something to their advantage" I
called upon a stock-broking friend in
consequence. He did not seem greatly
impressed with the value of the seeuri-
ties. Yes, they certainly hart paid
seventy per cent.—but only for three
months. For many years, they had
yielded nothing at all in the shape uf
interest. Under these circumstances,
they were not quite so mnoh respected
as Consols. For the rest, they had been
issued at 40, and were now at some-
thing rather under 4%.
From this, it appeared, they had
fallen rather considerably.
"But," said my stock-broking
friend, speaking of the Bonds as if
they had been a confirmed invalid in the last stage of a rapid decline.
"They may be a little better this morning. At any rate, I will go
over to the House and see."
He left me in a small office. There were maps upon the walls, of
half finished railways and projected gold mines. A blue paper,
giving the latest "odds"—I should say "prices"—was hanging
over the mantelpiece, above a bottle or water, flanked by
a couple of tumblers. I sat down and waited. Suddenly I became
conscious of a noue, that sounded like the ticking of the clock in the
tower of the Houses of Parliament—exaggerated. Only it was in-
termittent, like the pulse of a giant suffering from indigestion. It
stopped abruptly—then it began arain. I traced the sounds, and
found that they proceeded from a little instrument, from which was
issuing by starts and jerks, a long paper tape. On the tape was
printed a number of city quotations. The paper seemed to exercise
a strange influence upon me. I wan fascinated. It assumed all sorts
of uncouth shapes. Now it rolled about like a serpent, now it
enfolded me in its coils, now it fell in fanciful festoons from the
o«iling. It was quite a relief to me, when my stock-broking friend
returned. His manner, however, was strange. He was no longer
cool and collected, but very excited.
"I can see in your face," he cried, "that you want to know the
mysteries of Capel Court! Well, we have been boys together, and
your inmost wishes shall be gratified I I am running a dreadful
risk! It I am discovered, a lingering death in the dreadful dune-eone
under the House, will be my portion! But no matter—come! Under
my sheltering guidance, you shall beard the wily stock- broker in his
very den! You wear the garb of one who seems to have just
quitted a band-box! In such a costume, you are likely to escape
observation! Once more then—come!"
Thus earnestly addressed, I could but accept his invitation. We
walked down an allev. and passed through a pair of swinging doors,
to meet a beadle. But the liveried guardian was no bar to our
progress. We left another pair of swinging doors behind us, and
were in the House itself.
It was an enormous room. White walls bare of ornament. Here
and there a desk at which sat the dealers in Government Stock, and
other high class securities. A clock
and lots of notice boards. In the
centre a rostrum out of which ap-
peared and disappeared like a figure
in a Punch and Judy Show, an at-
tendant wearing a ^old-banded hat.
In other parts of the building more
Punch and Judy figures of a similar
character. Occasionally the puppets,
1 mean the officials, jumped up like
Jacks in the Box, and shouted out a
name, I oould not help fancying that
they must have taken lessons in elo-
cution from the doorkeeper of Lloyds.
'Beadles f" I asked in a whisper.
"No,—Waiters!" replied my friend
in the same tone. He took out a small
hook with a red binding and hurried
away. Before leaving, however, he
mumbled, "No strangers admitted
here. So be careful and dissemble to
the best of your ability."
I did dissemble. I placed my hands in my pockets, and hearing
that the officials were Waiters I tried to look hungry. I expected
every moment to see them spring up from their recesses with plates

of luscious viands. Bat so far as T could see, their connection with
the kitchen, was as remote as possible.
Then I turned my attention to the members. I found on all sides
spick and span Gentlemen conversing at the top of their voices.
Now and then they adopted a lower tone. When this happened they
laughed with glee. Were these confidential utterances connected
with gigantic speculations? I was full of respectful amazement.
Here was I in the very centre of commercial enterpr^e! The npiiik
and span Gentlemen before me represented the Capital of the World!
It was a very great thought indeed! At first I was afrnid to mix
amongst them. But soon my curiosity conquered my timidity, and
I ventured to mingle with the "leviathans of commerce" while they
were engaged in their gigantic operations.
Why, what was this? The Levkthani—some of them Levi-
Nathans—were at play!! Quips, cranks, and quiddities! Business
now and then in a light and airy manner, but fun first and foremost.
Why the whole place was redolent of mad ways! There was
scarcely a member who wag not what may be called "an amusing
rattls!" Such stories! Such sparklers! Such quaint anecdotes!
Who were these humorists of the East, these farceurs of the City?
A fresh surprise! Instead of stock-brokers some of the members
were warriors! Here was a "Captain," there a "Field Marshal,"
and yonder a " Count." And now I drifted into a land of riddles.
What was that about " cynical C?" Who was "DOUSHT?" And
why such frequent, albeit complimentary, allusions to '' the Ancient
Lubricator?" And where was " the Rat," and what was he doing?
And, lastly, what could possibly be meant by "Ugly Mug" and
"the Missing Link?" I was perplexed beyond measure, when sud-
denly there was a dead silence. Quotations and quips ceased in a
moment, and the stillness was positively painful. The Chief Waiter
(looking now like a Jack-in-the-Box who had taken up the profes-
sion of an auctioneer), suddenly rose from his rostrum. Heavens!
had my dissembling been ineffectual, and was I now about to be
publicly denounced as a traitor in the camp P In a state of suspended
animation 1 listened for that Waiter's voice. He knocked three
times on a desk before him, as if something were "Going, going,
gone!" The something went! It was the credit of somebody de-
parting for ever! At all events, it did not personally concern me.
A melancholy pause, and then once more, " Vive l<t bagatelle .'"
"The moat dramatic thing I have ever seen!" I observed to a
Gentleman standing near me.
The Gentleman looked at me sharply,
noticed that I had no red book under
ray arm, and shouted "Fourteen
hundred I"
In a moment I was surrounded. The
amusing rattles treated me with the
utmost politeness. And yet somehow
I lost my hat! Profuse apologies were
tendered to me; and yet I began to
think it better to get towards the door!
I was implored to stay : and yet I think
1 must have been pushed by some one
from behind! But in compensation
coppers were thrown at my feet, and
the "fun" became fast and furious!
All of a sudden it dawned upon me
that I was the centre of a ring of
scoffers! The Waiters rushed towards
me, ana. — . » » LHAVINQ STOCX EXCHAN«B.
"Hallo I" shouted my stock-broker
friend, re-entering his office, "you must have been asleep! What

"Where am I?" I gasped out. "Am I safe?"
"Well, not to sell Duloigno Seventies. They are rather flat this
morning—down to one-and-a-quarter!"
Waiving away the notion of a deal in Duloignos, I hurriedly
related my adventures.
"A dream, my good fellow," said my friend. "Not a bit like

tell you so!"
No doubt he was right. Still the dream seemed so real, that my

HOME FOE THE HOLIDAYS.
MY DEAR YOUNG FRIENDS,
You are now happily assembled at home, after the scholastic
exertions of the last half year, and I, as your Mentor and best friend,
think it only right that I should give you a few hints, whereby you
can make hame conscious of your arrival, and even more conscious of
your departure about the eighteenth of next month.
You will first of all naturally wish to visit all the pantomimes,
which, considering that this year only Covent Garden, Drury Lane,
the Surrey, the Grecian, the Imperial, and the Britannia Theatres
present pantomimes, is so modest a request, that the sternest parents
will not fail to comply with it. For this kindness on the part of your
parents, it is your duty to show them some generosity in return.
They will very likely loss the enjoyment of their dinners by dining
at an abnormal hour, will venture out in the cold of the nights, which
ig so injurious to elderly people, will sit through an entertainment,
which, though sport to you, is very dreary to them, and will under-
go all this martyrdom for your sakea. Nay, even they will go so far
as to give up their precious afternoons in order to accompany you to
what are known as morning performances. Do not allow this!
Think with pride and gratitude on all of what your parents have
done for you, and in return do them. Say kindly, but firmly, when
they propose to take you to the theatre, "Our dear Mother and
Father, we cannot allow it. You shall not be martyred for our sakes.
Enjoy your dinner. Dine at eight o'clock as usual. Linger over
your cigarette and coffee afterwards. Don't lose your afternoons.
Pay calls, have five o'clock tea, buy presents for your offspring, but
don't let your unselfishness make you miserable. Let us go to the
theatres by ourselves, give us sufficient money to dine at the Grand,
or the Hofborn Restaurant at our own time, and if we are not home
by two or three in the morning, don't be uneasy, for we shall have
the latchkey." This depriving yourselves of your parents' society,
will indeed make them proud of yon.
Next you will want to give a party. Now your parents will
doubtless ask your friends to come at seven and go away at ton.
How are your parents or your friends' parents to get their evening's
amusement with such a state of things? No I Take all trouble of!
your parents' hands, and send out the invitations yourselves. Ask
no one before ten. You cannot too early learn the rules of Society.
Insist upon a good supper. Have nothing to do whatever with
negus or lemonade, such drinks being most noxious to the system.
All doctors agree that dry champagne and very old Scotch whiskey
are the only two refreshments that can he taken with impunity. In
these days of progress, a cigarette after supper will be highly
relished by both your male and female guests.
I have now given you directions for your behaviour for the two
chief events of the holidays you are enjoying. I would otherwise
call your attention to the facts that continual practice is necessary
before sliding down the banisters can be considered a graceful
feat of gymnastics; that snow-balling is a fine athletic exercise,
strengthening the muscles, and steadying the eye; that only molly-
coddles of the most degraded type fear to venture on the ice before
it is really safe; that the sedentary dulness of your servants' lives
will be agreeably diversified by perpetually ringing the bells all
over the house; that as minors you are not answerable for any debts
you may contract, and that therefore you have now an opportunity
of enriching your bedrooms with rare engravings from old Masters,
Queen Anne furniture, and costly tapestry, whioh may never occur
again; that to throw brightness and cheeriness into the prosaic
existence of your parents, you should never omit to pass their
studies or boudoirt without waiting outside the door to sing a verse
of " Sicking Jemima Doton-Stairt," or " Grandmother'* out on the
Booze" to ienrn which ditties you should, on your off-nights, attend
the music-halls; that your parents' friends are not necessarily
yours, so that some you should treat with distant politeness, others
ignore altogether, and to others show your marked disgust and con-
tempt; and that, finally, your parents are in all probability not the
very intelligent, extraordinary people they would have you believe
them to be, but mere commonplace, humdrum, jogtrot, mediocre
sort of folks, and to be told as much.
Attend to these directions, my dear young friends, and during the
holidays you will make home vivacious, and your absence long felt.
Yours, holiday-makingly,

THB Seldom-at-Hotne Secretary has at last caused an inquiry to" be made respecting:
Billingsgate Market, and the fishmongers have stood up nobly for their offensive and old-
fashioned property. They abused the Corporation for not spending a million of public money
to make a new thoroughfare into Billingsgate. It was proved in evidence that a van had
come laden with the same fish for eleven consecutive days, and being unable to unload, the
food was at last condemned; and still the United Fishmongers thought that Billingsgate, and
everything connected with it, were thoroughly perfect. It was proved in evidence that six
hundred tons of solid food a year, or over half a million of fish in nine months, were
destroyed in consequence of the want of market accommodation, and still the United Fish-
lanigers thought that Billingsgate, and everything connected with it, wer* simply perfect
If the thousands of hungry, ill-fed, half-fed, and starving dwellers at the East-End of
London could have been examined by the
Seldom-at-Home Secretary's representative,
this monotonous song of praise might have
been a little varied. It was proved in
evidence that nearly seven-eighths of all
the fish that came to London was brought
by railway, and might be sold to con-
sumers without being forced through a
small, antiquated, and ill-placed market,
and still the United Fishmongers thought
that Billingsgate, and everything con-
nected with it, were absolutely perfect.
One enthusiast told his fellow-fishmongers
that seven centuries were looking down
upon them, and that London had better
sink (he might have put the "t" in this
word) than that the Corporation should do
away with such a glonous Institution as
Billingsgate Market. It remains to be seen
whether the Seldom-at-Home Secretary
and his advisers will take the same rosy
view of Lowest Thames Street and its
gigantic nuisance.

AN OLD OFFENDER AND A NEW TRIAL.

bably refers to the part he takes in the duel—which is a muddley
media? of tragic, oomic, and burlesque materials. Vivacious Miss

and perpetual motion could make the part successful, then this
lady would have achieved her object within the first half-hour.
Miss CONSTANCF, LOSEBY sings at her best, and puts as much acting
as there is scope for into the part of Marguerite. Miss HUSK BELL,
as Sietel, always sj beau as a young: man, reappeared on the scene
of her former triumphs. Mr. LIONEL BKOTJOH'S acrobatic convulsions
as the dying Valentine were
funny.
t The Bracken Revels are
fairly effective, but nothing
great, that is, for the Al-
hambra, which we feel in
this instance has brocken
with its old traditions.
The music, well executed
as it always is under the
direction of M. JACOBI,
seemed to lack "go" and
sparkle. Mr. LKSLIK, as
Old Fitust, gave an imita-
tion of a parrot which was
rapturously enoortd. He
did it "like a bird!" The
piece as produced on the
first night, is far too long,
and requires what our Artist
has given it—tomigood Cuts.
After the verdict on Meflttnftlt, we move for A New Trial, which,
though not exactly a rollicking Christmas piece, we do most heartily
advise all playgoers, capable of appreciating true Dramatic art, to
s«e, as it is now being represented at the Prince of Wales's Theatre.
It is some time since we
have witnessed so care-
fully studied and so
artistically finished a
performance as that of
Mr. CHAKI.HX CoGHLAJT,
in the part of Corrado,
—and the same may be
said with equal truth of
the Alibi played by Mr.
FLOCKTON, of Dr. Pal-
mieri played by Mr.
JAMES FJKKNANDEZ—ad-
mirably "made up,"—of
the Ayata of Mrs. LEIGH
MUKUAY, and of Miss
AMY ROSKLLE, who has
no easy task in the hope-
lessly auti - sympathetic
part of Mosalia. Nor
must Miss SOTDKHX be
omitted, who deserves
great praise for her interpretation of Annetla, the young girl of
fourteen, who, with one false note or anything like an exaggeration
of manner, could have rendered the strongest situations supremely
ridiculous. s*g
While highly commending the acting, we are bound to condemn

DR. PALMIERI AND ROSALIA.
(Latett Addition to tht Chamber of
Horrors.)
the glaringly false sentiment and atrociously repulsive character of
the play. What is the storv? An impulsive, passionate, young
Calabrian artist loves and elopes with a young Calabrian girl of
seventeen. Her relations are furious, and her brother, while
attempting to abduct her from her lawful husband, is stabbed
by the latter who is defending the inviolable sanctity of his hearth
and home. For this he is condemned for life to the galleys—the
extenuating circumstances of having simply pot rid of an objection-
able brother-in-law not being taken into consideration. The wife
and child are left alone in the
world—her family, by the way,
must have been as wretchedly
poor as they were snobbishly proud
— and are offered shelter by a
highly respectable young Doctor
who happens to have quite recently
become a widower in want of what
he coolly terms " consolation." The
wife lives under his roof as gover-
ness to her own child, who is
brought up in the belief that Dr.
Palmieri is her father.
After thirteen years, Corrado
the Convict—a good melodramatic
and transpontine title by the way,
of which we here make a present
to Mr. COGHLAN, "no rights re-
served " — turns up and claims,
naturally enough, his wife and
child. He has suffered for his
crime, is sincerely penitent, and,
but for some pardonable eccentri-
cities of manner, is altogether a
far more amiable, and interesting person than Doctor Palmieri, who,
with his peculiar views of marriage, regards the escaped convict as
an unmitigated nuisance.
Though Rosalia momentarily redeems her character by offering at
the last to accompany her husband wherever he chooses to take her,
yet she makes it evident that, in spite of her hvpocritical assertion
to the contrary, she no longer has the slightest affection for the man
to whom she had given her first arid best love, who for her sake
alone had committed the crime for which he haa so fully atoned,
and who, impelled by overmastering love for her and his child, has
risked death itself to throw himself at her feet, and clasp his daughter
in his arms. She coolly allows that she has become very fond of the
Doctor; and argues that a convict-father would only frighten their
daughter into tits—which is highly probable, but easily obviated—
and gives Corrado to understand that, in a gfceral way, he is an
Obstructionist. The Doctor explains
the case to him in a cold, calculating
way, his own child informs him that
she will be happier when he's gone,
and so the poor man sees nothing for
it but to return to prison,—he is too
honest to think of trying brigandage,
—or to poison himself with the contents
of a flask, which, "unbeknown " to the
gaolers, he has carried about with him
for thirteen years! He tells his child
to pray for him, while he tosses off the
"fine old crusted" poison, and then he
dies in the presence of his wife (shed-
ding crocodile's tears) and the Doctor
(not even attempting a remedy), who
must be secretly chuckling over it as a
really "very happy release." Nothing
but first-rate acting could carry sucn
a piece,—and this it has got.
And now let us suggest that at
Christmas - time, just to make things
pleasant all round, Mr. COGHLAN should
add a Fifth Act, on the following
lines :—

"ABB£ THOUGHT!"
(A Study in Black.)
Curtain rites, and discovers Dr. PAIMIEIU, with ROSALIA and
AKNETTA dressed for travelling.

A CHRISTMAS NIGHTMARE.
ONCE, it happened
I 'd been dining,
on my couch I
slept reclining,
And awoke with
moonlight shin-
ing brightly on
my bedroom
floor,
It was in the bleak
December,
Christmas night
as I remember,
But I had no dy-
ing ember, as
FOB had; when
near the door,
Like a gastrono-
mic goblin just
beside my cham-
ber door,
Stood a bird,—
and nothing
more.
And I said, for
I 'm no craven,
"Are you ED-
GAR'S famous
raven,
Seeking as with him a haven—Were you mixed up with LKNORK P"
•Then the bird uprose and ilutter'd, and this sentence strange he
utter'd—

"Hang I.KNORE," he mildly muttered; "you hare teen me ones
before.
Been me on this festive Christmas, seen me surely once before.
1 'm the Goose,"—and nothing- more.
Then he murmured, "Are you ready ?" and with motion slow and
steady,
Straight he leapt upon my bed. I simply gave a stifled roar;
And I cried, " As I 'm a sinner, at a Goose Club I was winner,
'Tis a mem'ry of my dinner, which I ate at half-past four;
Goose well stuffed with saije and onions, which I ate at half-past
four." Quoth he hoarsely, "Eat no more!"
Said I, "I've enjoyed your juicas, breast and back; but tell me,
Goose, is
This revenge, and what the use is of your being such a bore?
For goose-flesh I will no more ' ax,' if you'll not sit on my thorax.
Go, try honey mixed with borax, for I hear your throat is sore;
You speak gruffly though too plainly', and I 'm sure your throat is
sore." Quoth the nightmare, "Eat no more I"
"Goose 1" I shrieked out, "Leave, oh, leave me I surely you don't
mean to grieve me '(
You are heavy, pray reprieve me, now my penance must be o 'er;
Though to-night you 've brought me sorrow, comfort surely comes
to-morrow.
Some relief from thee T 'd borrow at my doctor's ample store,
There are pills of purest azure in that doctor's ample store."
Quoth the goblin, "Eat no more I"
And that fat Goose, never flitting, like a nightmare still is sitting
With me all the night, emitting words that thrill my bosom's core;
Now, throughout the Christmas season, while I lie and gasp and
wheeze, on
Me he sits, until my reason nothing surely can restore,
I am driven mad, and reason nothing surely can restore;
While that Goose says, " Eat no more 1"

Lifts eyes of blue to smile on yon,
Time cannot age nor trouble chill her;
But, boy, you '11 need strong hand and true
Upon yonr tiller.
The tumbling wave, the threatening sky,
Portend a deal of dirty weather.
Blow high, blow low, 'tis yours to try
And ride them—you ana Hope together.
Frail bark, young mariner, rough sea!
Nursling had seldom queerer quarters.
God speed your keel, my boy, say we,
Into smooth waters!
Yonder, her troublous voyage done,
Founders the worn-out hulk, Old Eighty,
Your craft seems slight, young Eighty-One,
For seas so high, for freight so weighty.
But buoyancy helps youth and boats
To ride o'er waves, to tide o'er troubles,
And Hope o'er turbid torrents floats
Like leaves or bubbles.
'Twill not be all plain sailing though
Upon the tack you take, poor youngling.
Your steering needs be deft, you know,
'Tis scarce the hour for boyish bungling.
Both East and West things still look black,
Hand upon tiller well may tighten;
Btren jth mutt not sleep, nor watching slack,
Till skies shall brighten.
Son Voyage, still! Dull, lumpish fear
Would overload your cockboat sadly;
Better set sail with words of cheer,
And enter on the voyage gladly.
Away with boding thoughts, away
With dismal doubts and oroakings craven I
Here's wishing you swift cruise and gay,
And a safe haven!
Gagging the Volunteers.
THE COMMANDEE-IN-CHIEF has issued a " general order" denying
the right of political discussion to Volunteers in uniform, if the dis-
cussion involves "politioal matter of a controversial nature." As a
Volunteer is a tax-payer, who pays for the regular Army, including
the COMHANDF.u-iN-CniEF1, and then offers to do one half the work
as an amateur, this order is particularly graceful and well-timed.
The Clown appears to represent the Government at this so-called
festive season, with a red-hot poker as a symbol of power.
Good-bye, Telephone!
THE Law has spoken, and the Telephone is told to leave a country
which is tied hand and foot to the Telegraph. The ten millions of
public money poured into the pockets of stock-jobbers in 1869 has
bound England to the Telegraph and the Telegraph to England for
ever. We may read about scientific progress, but we must go abroad
to see it. The wire that misspells a message, and the street Arab
who delivers it at his leisure, are all we shall get in this country till
the day when we are conquered by the Irish.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PLAYERS AND PAYERS.
I. "PUT MONJSY IN THT PUKSB."
IK, — Mr. RDSKIN has recently addressed some pertinent
remarks on the subject of Dramatic Reform to the Sec-
retary of the well-meaning hut mysterious D.R. Assooia-
1 t ion. I do not intend to emulate
Mr. RUSKIN
On the Buskin.
But there are Reforms and Reforms, in things Theatri-
cal, no less than in things Political. There is a world
before and a world behind the curtain. Of the rare and
radiant spirits who people the latter, none but the highly
privileged Few may presume to speak; but in the former
no fool need fear to tread who has the necessary shillings
in his pocket.
The necessary shillings— in fact, the Needful— which
brings me at once to my subject, "playhouse prices."
Fools or Angels, the unprivileged must all pay; but
though we would naturally range ourselves with my Lord
BEACONSFIELD on the side of the Angels, the thought
will intrude that we may be something foolish to pay
through the nose as we do now. As a rule, I notice that.
the largest-nosed people don't pay at all. But this by
the way. "Pis true a seat at the theatre is not a "neces-
sary" (as young Hopeful pleads when he can't, and Papa
won't, pay for some pretty freak of Undergraduate
fancy), and no one expects a dinner at the "Star and
Garter" for tha price of a chop at the "Cock." But
Man, though born to sorrow, is willing enough to barter
his birthright when he can. Even the most grave and
reverend of us like to unbend and stretch our legs some-
times—though the stalls of our theatres are, to be sure,
the places to do anything rather than stretch our legs,
but of this hereafter — and it is really becoming a serious
question how much longer we, the great unprivileged
and poor relations of the Mammon Family may afford to
include the theatre among our "stock of harmless
pleasures."
It was the little High-and-Mitey Theatre that in-
augurated these extravagant prices, in the days when
first it began to wax fat and splendid under that aristo-
cratic patronage which it has ever since courted so ex-
clusively, and, let it be said, so successfully. The High-
and-Mitey became what our friend 'Aituir calls " quite
the Stilton." Of course its rivals followed suit, and now
those houses where a stall may be bought for less than
half-a-guinea — even after a pilgrimage to the box-office
to avoid the fees of the Libraries— might be counted on
the fingers of one hand. Five shillings— he need be no
grandfather to remember when a stall cost no more than
that — then seven shillings, now half-a-guinea, — to-morrow how
much? Like SHELLEY'S skylark, higher and higher the price mounts.
You will answer, my good Managers — and very good Managers
you undoubtedly are — that any tradesman (only you would probably
use some less vulgar word) is a fool who sells for five shillings an
article which will command ready purchasers at ten. Granted; and
let it be granted, too, that Sir GoRorus MIDAS, your great patron
and friend, would not deign to consign his lordly person to a seat
rated at no higher value than a dirty five shillings. To him the more
costly the entertainment, the more exquisite its beauty. What
constituted, in his eyes, the greatest charm of the gifted SAKAH '(
Unquestionably the price he had to pay to look at her. But recollect
that Sir GORGIUS, though a very splendid creature while he lasts, is
apt to be of a somewhat volatile essence. Like his grammar, he is an
uncertain quantity. Your real strength, after all, lies in us, the
Great Unprivileged, not in the " Upper Ten," the gilded few.
We are like the Dutch, perhaps you say; we ask too much and wish
to give top little. Look at all the splendour around you, you cry:
the magnificent stall you sit in, with its glittering monogram: the
beautiful draperies, the gilding, the paintings on the walls, busts in
the lobbies, rare shrubs on the landings, picture galleries, smoking
saloons, with marble tables and soft couches: luxury and art every-
where, and all for the ridiculously small sum of ten shillings-and-
sixpence! Precisely so. But, my worthy Managers, where is the
need of all these pretty things in a theatre P Is it for these we, the
Unprivileged, go to the playhouse P If we want pictures, remember
there is a tolerably good collection in Trafalgar Square, which we
can see for nothing: and all manner of beautiful, and strange, and
costly things at South Kensington that may be inspected any day
for very little more. Give us a clean house, a comfortable seat, and
a good play, and don't charge for needless upholstery. We little
folk are not used to all this magnificence ; it makes us dissatisfied with
our humble lot. And I take leave to doubt whether the great folk
TWIST."
care as much about it as you think. They have plenty of it at home,
you see, and the genuine article. Don't you remember when Lord
STBTNE dined with the King, what GEOHGB the Magnificent gave his
noble guest? Gad! a neck of mutton and turnips, and how pleased
that splendid nobleman, with his heaven knows now many French
cooks, was with his humble fare?
"If we choose to spend our money thus on the outside of the cup
and platter," retort Messieurs the Managers, "what is that to you?
It is our risk, not yours." Fair and softly, my friends. Has not he
who pays the piper some right to call the tune P It is your own
riak, certainly; but who supplies you with the funds to run it?
Deeper and deeper go yonr fingers into our pockets to pay for all
these pretty gew-gaws. If w« must spend our money, surely we
have a voice in the selection of the article? And we, the public, the
Great Unprivileged, are a little wiser than you take us for. You are
safe enough, you think, in the rivalry of competition, and perhaps
you are; but this is a world of reaction, and if some simple spirit
should arise to preach the doctrine that "the play's the thing," and
should give old Paterfamilias as comfortable a seat for himself and
his belongings, and quite as good, may be a better, entertainment
for a much smaller sum than that for which you undertake to sur-
round him with the very latest gimcrackery from the Upholsterers
and Wardour Street, and from the Studios of Unappreciated Talent
what will Paterfamilias do?
For the present—the Christmas present—allow me, being but a
poor old Boy, to subscribe myself—I can't subscribe much more—
yours hopefully, OLIVEB TWIST.
SONGS OF THE SCIENCES.-II. ASTRONOMY.
OMB study with me
every bright
constellation
Of stars that you
see in the skies
on each night,
Those fanciful
groups will
compel admi-
ration,
-111inu dim and
far distant,
some d» /
zlingly bright.
You'll see the
two Bears, and
you '11 oft fix
your eye on
The Dragon and
Swan, and Her
Ladyship's
Chair,
The Serpent, the
Eagle, the
Crown, and
Orion,
The Whale and
the Wolf, and
the Snake and
the Bear.
Then look at the San, and we '11 learn, to begin, it's
A distance of ninety-one millions of miles;
But light does the journey in under nine minutes,
Which beats all express trains that run in these isles.
We learn, too, his force must be daily diminished,
That curious spots oft appear on his face,
And THOMSON says one day the sun will be finish'd,
And roll, a " cold black ball," through infinite space.
We '11 find out the reason of total eclipses,
When, strangely, the Moon seems to eat up the Sun,
We '11 see how the Planets whirl round in ellipses,
And how the four Seasons are duly begun.
How ages ago the fair Moon was volcanic,
As those can observe who through telescopes look,
And, certes, the craters are truly Titanic,
As figured by NASMITH in LoOKTB'l book.
Then gaze on each Nebula's wonderful pattern,
And watch the hot Comets go flaring away;
We 've measured Jove's moons and the queer rings of Satnrn,
But own that we 're puzzled by Mercury's day.
Then ponder the Planets, their paths and dimensions.
Astronomy's surely a science sublime:
We '11 soar o'er the world with its cares and dissensions,
And henceforward live by Sidereal Time!

NEW YEARS AND OLD.
(A Growl to a Greeting. Growled by old Mr. GRIZZLKWIO.)
MANY Happy New Tears do you wish me, Sir? Me 1
Why, you know I can't live many New Years to see.
And at my time of life—the wrong side of threescore—
All a man's years that might have been happy are o'er.
As for me, Sir, I never a happy year knew;
Future years won't be happier, and mine will be few.
If I owned all the wealth that I wish for in vain,
'Twould but ease ofi the years that before me remain.
Had I ten times the riches I ever possessed
At your age in my youth, Sir, I might have been blest
With the means of good living, and then, I 've no doubt
I should, worse than I am, have been troubled with Gout.
Iperhaps might have married, and made a mistake—
Which I hadn't, like others, the money to make;
Might for love have espoused an unsuitable wife,
Who 'd have been, and would still be, the plague of my
life,
And render my New Year, commencing to-day,
Still farther from happy than 'tis, a long way.
And, Sir, e'en though I now were as rich as a Jew,
Than the Old Year I sadder should still find the New,—
To Gout, I repeat, Sir, a martyr the while,
And a prey to Dyspepsia, Bronchitis, and Bile;
The source of all manner of ailments and ills
Fur which money can't purchase infallible pills.
I don't dare to enjoy the delights of the table,
And besides, want of appetite makes me unable.
All my pleasures must yearly grow lesser and lesser,
And each twelvemonth prove worse than its bad prede-
cessor.
Many Happy New Years'may yourself, Sir, go through,
But you '11 have the advantage of me it you do.
Each New Year I remember since when a small boy,
I 've heard people wish friends and acquaintances joy,
As if hoping good wishes would yet, fur all past
Disappointment, be crowned with fulfilment at last.
And reflect, Sir:—Did ever vou happen to hear
Any mortal acknowledge a Happy Old Year P
SEASONABLE FOLK-LORE.
IF the first person who enters your house in the New
Year goes in with his right foot foremost, ill luck
will befall you. If the person has his face blackened, a
revolver in his right hand, a jemmy in his left, and
"CHABLES PEACE, a Monograph," in his pocket, ill-
luck will befall you very soon.
It is considered unfortunate by some people to go
underneath a ladder. These are the people on whom
workmen have dropped pots of paint and molten lead.
Others consider it unfortunate to pass outside a ladder.
These are they who have stepped off the pavement into
the road, and been run over by traction-engines.
The Folk-Lore with regard to salt is conflicting. If
you have spilt salt on the table, and have then thrown a
handful over your left shoulder, the servant who receives
this in his eyes seldom considers that ill-luck has been
averted. If you help your neighbour to salt, you and
she are certain to quarrel if, at the time of your un-
called-for politeness, she is eating ham, bacon, meringues,
or ice-puddings. Some people when they have spilt salt
on a table-cloth, immediately pour a glass of claret over
it, to take out the stain. But this is invariably late in
the evening, and arises rather from a confusion of ideas
than from any accurate knowledge of Folk-Lore.
It is most unlucky to look at the new moon through
glass. Want of attention to this maxim is the reason
why so many people who wear spectacles are short-
sighted. Also why astronomers generally come to grief.
The case of GALILEO will at once occur to any chfld in
the fourth standard at a Board School.
If you dip your hands into a basin where even your
best friend has cleansed his face, you and he will quarrel.
This particularly holds true when your best friend has
been playing Clown in an amateur pantomime, or
tmulating the glories of MOORB and BDRGESS lor the
benefit of a drawing-room.
