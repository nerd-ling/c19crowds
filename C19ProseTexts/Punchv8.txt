MIDSUMMER is come ; and with all its other glories-its sun and flowers — “ the
pomp of groves, and garniture of fields "--brings with it that additional blessing
to the human family,- ANOTHER VOLUME OF Punch !
And mankind-it delights us to avow the ennobling truth-mankind is touched with gratitude
for the felicity! MR. GIBBON, who wrote about those homicidal and burglarious rascals, the Romans,
deemed it a matter for his especial thanks, that he was born the member of a civilized nation : that he
was not born a Hottentot Gibson, to be girdled with ovine offal—not an Esquimaux Gibbon, with a
fish-bone through his nostrils—but an English GIBBON, inheriting the decencies of broad-cloth and silken
hose, and privileged for rump-steaks and port like any other Christian gentleman. In the like way, let
the present generation of men express a rapturous thanksgiving that they live in the printing days of
Punch! Let them, however, not be vainglorious or arrogant in their happiness. No: whilst the small
tear of gratitude twinkles in their right eye for a peculiar blessing, let them think with mournful
pity—with affectionate tenderness on the benighted condition of their forefathers. For they-poor souls !
-lived not in the typographic days of Punch!
But men are grateful. The hearts of the Antipodes beat towards us! There is no infant colony
throughout the world that does not hold forth to us its little hands, even as babies hold forth theirs to their
loving fathers, to be nursed and dandled. And we are proud of this affection! Very proud ; albeit
we continue to walk without silver trumpets before us, and hitherto have not mounted a peacock's
feather in our Sunday beaver !
We have selected this page wherein to write a letter to all the Powers of earth—to acknowledge
their kind intentions towards us, briefly—but oh! with what sincerity !
All the Crowned Heads that glorify this otherwise shabby world have sent deputations to Punch
—(he has said not a word of the matter in his own Court Circular)-inviting him to pass the Midsummer
Holidays at their several Courts. “Dearest, sweetest Punch,”—
-80 runs the tenor of their invitations-

iv
PREFACE.
“ You will have finished your Eighth Volume ; come, and make merry with us : come, and make us frolic with your mirth—thoughtful
with your wisdom."
It gave us some pain to refuse the summons to Windsor Castle. But as the said summons was accompanied with a notification
that our visit must be kept a profound secret,-inasmuch as it was hinted the presence of Literary and Artistic genius at the Royal Table
might bring it into disrepute-we felt that we owed it to our illustrious Order—the Order of the Goose-Quill and Pencil-not to visit
even Windsor incog.
Louis-PHILIPPE pressed us, very kindly, to the Tuileries. And had JOINVILLE been at sea, we think we should—despite of all old
differences—have gone. But we were afraid that that mischievous boy would have primed our cigar with gunpowder, have put detonating
stuff in our pillow, or have committed some trick that we must have chastised him for, and—we would not break the entente cordiale
between the two countries.
QUEEN ISABELLA graciously promised us, if we'd visit Madrid, one of her sweetest bonbons, besides the Order of the Lolly Pop!
But old Punch is not to be caught with sugar_especially Spanish sugar.
And then for the Court of Portugal! No: thought we; we would rather visit a Court of St. Giles ; for though we hate dirt,
still there we should have it unmixed with the worst dirt of the world-pride.
METTERNICH, on the part of his master, was civil ; but we thought of Italy, of the blood of the BANDIERAS, and we said—no!
PRESIDENT Polk begged we would honour America. ' No, no,” said
we, you Americans rob poor Punch enough, as is : if he
were to trust himself bodily among you, you might suddenly take a fit of Yankee honesty, and sell him, it may be to Russia, to pay off
your debts."
And coming to Russia, reminds us that BARON DE BRUNOW waited on us to tempt us to St. Petersburg (and thence to Siberia).
We must, however, say thus much in praise of the Ambassador's modesty: he knew what Punch thought of NICHOLAS, and had not the
impudence to put the question. The Baron, having caught our indignant eye, vanished in confusion.
We received a very flattering invitation from Kingling Dan I. of Ould Ireland. His Majesty assured us, that if we would only
come as guest to Dublin, we should not be very much hooted-and that only “the smallest taste in life” of eggs and gutter-mud would
be thrown into our carriage.
Our
page would burst did we try to cram into it all the royal invitations—from that of China down to Morocco-sent us for the
present balmy Midsummer. No; said we, we will go to none of your Courts. No; we will visit neither Paris, nor St. Petersburg, nor
Pekin,—but we will go quietly and philosophically to Herne-Bay.
“ Meanwhile,” said we to the different deputations, "what a blessing is it that if Punch in person will not or cannot visit all or
any of your Courts, he can nevertheless appear there in all the glory of type, in all the emblazonment of illustration." All the deputations
seemed touched with this profound truth; and putting their hands upon their grateful hearts, they all withdrew. And we, falling back
in our easy-chair, saw in a vision thousands of genii carrying “PUNCH, Vol. 8.” to the furthermost corners of the earth !
“For ourself,” said we, we certainly will take packet for Herne-Bay. But we trust that there will be no firing of the Tower
guns on the occasion. The majesty of Letters needs not noise and smoke to tell of its whereabout."
We shall arrive at Herne-Bay quietly, unostentatiously. If the One Policeman of the Town be on the jetty to receive us, we
shall be more than satisfied.
Such is the modesty of true greatness ! Kings and conquerors, take a lesson from Punch !

To say the truth, we've run so many rigs,

New Year's Ode
TO THE WINNER OF THE ST. NISBETT.-SEASON, 1844.
A FAGGOT CASE.
At the Watlington Petty Sessions, one John PAGE,“ chair-maker,
of Wheelend, Stoken-church” (blessed be his door-posts !) charged
“JANE ALLEN, a wretchedly distressed-looking woman, with an infant at ber breast,
with having stolen, on the 25th of November, a small faggot of wood, of the value of
one penny,' from off a pile in Thirdswood."
Now, John Page, having this faggot very much next his heart-
indeed, it must have been pretty well of the same stuff—insisted
upon a conviction, and the woman-John PAGE's recording angel
has written down the fact
with the infant in her arms, was committed to Oxford gaol, to take her trial at the
Quarter Sessions, charged with stealing the said faggot, of the value of three-farthings."
What a very pleasant Christmas this John PAGE must have passed !
What a remarkably nice man to spend a Christmas with ! With
what sweet serenity he must have gone to Church,—for of course,
such a stickler for three-farthing honesty, has his pew and all things
proper, and pays his devotions regularly as his taxes. And then
when he returned to his jocund home, and having said grace, enjoyed
like a good man his Christmas dinner, with what extreme self-
contentment he must have looked upon his children (if he be blessed
with such cherubs) thinking of the felonious Jane Allen's babe
in Oxford gaol. And then, when he turned himself round to his fire,
thinking of the faggot, what pleasant things he must have seen in the
embers of his Christmas log! What a Jacob's ladder must his fancy
have pictured, with John Page, chairmaker, upon all but the top-
most round! And is this a man to want a faggot? Certainly not ;
Punch would give him one with all his heart and all his strength.

Ere light orange-blossoms weighed widowhood down!
And pause, oh ! SIR WILLIAM, ere one house adorning,
You cast in deep shadow our houses in town.
Why veil from the public its gayest of brides ?
The miser alone buries gold in a box ;
What artist, triumphant, his masterpiece hides ?
We leave to the stage its duennas and locks.
Bound fast, yet again let the Favourite run !
Both thine and our own !-a petition not risible ;
For though it is true man and wife are but one,

But give back the Spirit with Comedy's mask.

But deeper the sorrow that NISBETT has cost;
More stern thy resentment, susceptible town;
She wedded, returned ;-weds again, and we're lost;
From Scylla escaped, in Charybdis we drown !
Blest winner, but cruel ! most cruel to Art!
Yet more to YOUNG LONDON, who stood by her throne ;
Who now shall report how she toppeth her part ?-
Who rush for a seat she resides at her own !
Who weds a mere beauty, dooms dozens to grieve ;
Who marries an heiress, leaves hundreds undone ;
Who bears off an actress (she never took leave), ,
Deprives a whole city of rational fun.
But farewell the glances and nods of St. NISBETT ;
We list for her short ringing laughter in vain,
And yet-bereaved London !--what think you of this bet ?
“ A hundred to one we shall see her again !"
THE ELOCUTION SOCIETY.
Being desirous of taking a few lessons in public speaking, we hurried
off to the Elocution Society, which has lately been formed somewhere in
the City, by a small knot of ardent spirits, who burst, between the hours
of six and eight, from the bondage of the desk and counter. On reaching
the building at which the Society's meetings are advertised to be held, we
found the door wide open, and nobody in attendance to receive the com-
pany. At first we commenced a quiet stamp on the pavement, but this
movement having failed to excite any attention, we began knocking
violently with our cane upon the wall, which brought a man out of some
dark recess, who asked us what we wanted. We replied that we had
come to attend the meeting of the Elocution Society, and that we under-
stood the subject of the evening's oratory was to be the “ Writers of
Punch and the Humourists of England,” according to a printed card
which had been sent to us. The man replied, that if we wanted the
Elocution Society, we must walk up a flight of stairs, and along a dark
passage, till we got to a glass door, which was the door of the room where
the Society would be sitting. Having followed his directions as well as we
could, we arrived at the door, and heard a low murmuring inside, but not
liking to burst into the room without any introduction, we retreated to
the stairs, and shouted “Hollo over the banisters. The man having
obeyed our summons, we stated our reluctance to intrude; when he said
the Society would be delighted at anybody's coming in to listen, and he
strongly urged us to enter. Finding, however, that our modesty would
not permit us to do so, he advised us to beckon out the secretary, and
scratching off a little of the whitewash that had been rubbed over the
window to prevent people from staring in, he pointed out the gentleman
in the great-coat, as the functionary to whom we were recommended to
address ourselves. The seene within was extremely picturesque. There
were about eight persons in about eight different degrees of drowsiness,
while one was keeping his lips in a sort of regular motion, only varied
by occasional draughts at a glass of water, which the gentleman in the
great coat-kept continually replenishing from a large jug of the refreshing
element. ugh we were naturally desirous of hearing how we were
being treated by the “ Elocution Society," which had got us as the subject
of their evening's debate, we could not bring ourselves to interrupt the
calm serenity of the scene, and making a precipitate retreat from the
door, followed by the man, exclaiming, “ Won't you go in, Sir ? . Shall

habitat. In future, he had better lie with a little more discretion.
We are now tempted to extract a passage or two from the corres-
pondent's letter, that the reader will immediately perceive to be
illustrative of the intelligence and veracity of the writer. He is
speaking of a Mr. MARBLE, a clever American actor, very cordially
received on his first appearance at the Strand Theatre. Thence, he
went to the Haymarket, where his piece (a miserable farrago) failed.
But why did it fail ? Hear the London Correspondent.
“When it is known how great is the influence of the Society of Dramatic Authors, the
fate of this Yankee production will not be wondered at. There are ubout one hundred
and fifty members (THERE ARE, IN REALITY, ABOUT FIVE-AND TWENTY, AND OF
THESE FIVE AND-TWENTY, NOT ABOVE TEN WRITING MEN), and a large number of
these are, more or less, contributors to the daily and weekly papers.—Whenever a new
piece is announced at any of the metropolitan theatres, if it be from the pen of a member,
means are taken to insure it a favourable reception, the house is taken by surprise, the
plaudits of regular cluqueurs are so long and loud; the journals afterwards are unanimous
in praise of the new production. But if some unlucky manager dares to announce a piece
which is not written by a member, no matter how great its merits may be, the dramatic
clique are sure to be present on its representation, and with their claqueurs the picce is
hissed, condemned, and shouted off, and the journals assist to bury it in oblivion.”

IMPROVEMENTS
IN THE
METROPOLIS.
Hz Committee for the Improvement of Regent Street has just
published its half-yearly Report. The following extracts will show
the fine sense these Cachemire Lords have of the gratitude they owe
to the nobility and their carriage customers :-
“ Your Committee is happy to state, that the beadles have behaved
during the last half-year with the greatest vigilance and courage.
The beadle on the Right Quadrant has taken up no less than 17
lucifer-match girls and 30 bits of orange-peel; and the one on the
Left has effectually driven away 6 persons who were offering bull-
finches for old coats, and razors for old hats.
“ Your Committee is likewise happy to state, that the livery of the
former beadle, who was sent away for whistling, fits the present
beadle extremely well, and so has saved the subscribers the expense
of a new livery. The hat, however, was a little too large ; but this
has been remedied by inserting rounds of brown paper under the
lining sufficient to reduce it to the size of the smaller beadle's head.
“ Your Committee regrets that Patent-Safeties, advertising-carts,
organs, and omnibuses, are still allowed to circulate in Regent Street ;
but arrangements have been made for a copy of the Handbook of
Etiquette' to be presented to every ompibus conductor, and hopes
are entertained they may be induced in time to take “Stolberg's
V
Voice Lozenges,' to improve their tone in ghouting for passengers.
“ Your Committee has viewed with horror the number of long
beards and untrimmed mustachios allowed with impunity to pro-
menade the Quadrant; but a petition will be presented to Parliament
next session for the appointment of four barbers at each end of the
Quadrant. These means, your Committee has reason to hope, will be
sufficient to scare away all foreigners from Regent Street.
“ That as soon as the fine weather begins, the wood-pavement will
be beeswaxed every morning, and in the summer the streets will be
regularly watered with rose-water. The pavements, too, will be chalked
with beautiful illuminated patterns by the first artists from Munich,
and the gutters sprinkled twice a-day with Farina's Eau-de-Cologne.
“ That the policemen have received strict orders to wear white kid
gloves and polished leather boots, and to speak nothing but French.
“ That every dog in warm weather is to be tested by the pump
before he is allowed to come down Regent Street, always excepting
such beautiful little dogs as may be in ladies' carriages.
“ That the crossings are for the future to be laid down with India
matting, and the crossing-sweepers to be put immediately into livery.
“That no smoking is to be allowed, excepting the finest Principes, and no butcher's meat, or vegetables, to be carried to any of the residents
in the street till after dusk,
“ That the common people should be warned that it is necessary to dress in their Sunday clothes, and to be very particular in their gait and
demeanour, when walking down Regent Street.
“ That advertisements be inserted in the morning papers, that all cotton umbrellas, bundles, clogs, penny piemen, and persons without gloves, will
henceforth be rigidly excluded.
“ That this Report be printed on white satin, and a copy of it in gold letters be sent immediately to every member of the aristocracy."

LAY OF THE SPORTING LANDLORD.
WHEN I was sent to college,
'Twas in famous Oxfordshire;
Where I learnt Greek and Latin
For nearly four long year,
Till I came to my acres,
The truth you soon shall hear ;
Oh ! 'tis all my aim to preserve ny game
At all seasons of the year.
As I and my head-keeper
Were going of our rounds,
We pounced upon a countryman,
And lurcher, on my grounds;
“ Hallo,” said we, “ you vagabond,
What business have you here?"
Oh ! 'tis all iny aim to preserve my game
At all seasons of the year.
A hare, and brace of pheasants
Upon the rogue we found ;
We had him to the magistrate,
Who fined him twenty pound :
He could not pay the fine, my boys,
For it was so severe ;
Oh ! tis all my aim to preserve my game
At all seasons of the year.
Then he began to whimper,
And tell a piteous tale
About his wife and family ;
But we pack'd him off to gaol.
We pack'd him off to gaol, my boys,
Of mercy we'd not hear ;
Oh ! 'tis all my aim to preserve my game
At all seasons of the year.
Three months he lay in prison,
And, after that, was tried ;
Then six months of hard labour
He underwent beside :
His wife went to the workhouse,
And all his children dear ;
Oh ! 'tis all my aim to preserve my game
At all seasons of the year.
Now here's unto the Game Laws ;
Long may they be in force !
And here's to every magistrate
Who gives the Law its course :
A dungeon to each poacher,
That dwells both far and near.
Oh ! 'tis all my aim to preserve my game
At all seasons of the year.

friends to come and pass the night with you, and keep you alive with
their cheerful innocent gambols. At Constantinople, at Athens, Malta,
Cairo, Gibraltar, it is all the same. Your watchful friends persist in
paying you attention. The frisky and agile flea, the slow but steady-pur-

welcome the stranger to their shores—and never leave him during his
stay. At first, and before you are used to the manners of the country,
the attention is rather annoying. Here, for instance, is my miniature.

ANTIGONE ANALYSED.

AUDIA

CARDEN
ANTICONE
A MODEST young gentleman,
bâton in hand,
Walks up to the stool in the
midst of the Band ;
Apparently awed by the
numbers around,
He looks at the ceiling and
then at the ground.
His collar turned down his pretensions assert,
For Genius ever is known by the shirt.
A Symphony solemn is slowly gone through,
The instruments making a blunder or two,
Which causes the youth with the collar turned down
To crush an unfortunate Flute with a frown,
Or make at the Drum some exceeding wry faces,
As if the grosse caisse was the grossest of cases.
Unable to make head or tail of their shout,
We learn by the book what they ’re singing about.
They sing of a fight 'twixt a brother and brother,
In which one killed the one, and the other the other ;
At which we ejaculate mentally, “ That's
Exactly the case of Kilkenny's famed cats.''
Nor e'en to the end does the simile fail,
For nothing remains of them now but their tale.
The Chorus, expecting that Creon will enter,
With energy point to the door in the centre.
They say that he's summoned of sages a host
By Herald ! But why not by Times or by Post?
of the summons they're hoping to get at the cause,
When Creon walks in to a round of applause :
To the nobles assembled he tells his decree,
That poor Polynices unburied shall be.
They nothing reply, though they p’rhaps think it hard ;
When all of a sudden there enters a Guard-
He's full of alarm, and his toga and tights
Conduce to his looking the queerest of frights.
(King Creon was surely uncommonly needy,
If we judge by his guards, who are awfully seedy.)
The sentinel states, though he's watched night and day,
The body by somebody's taken away ;
The King in a truly monarchical fashion
Soon works himself into a towering passion,
The curtain ascends, and discovers a view-
To classic authority perfectly true ;
A stage-whose five different door-ways bespeak
That the scenic arrangement is thoroughly Groek,
Two ladies now enter-Antigone's one,
And when the applause at her entrance is done,
She gracefully turns to Ismene—the other,
And says she's determined to bury her brother.
In that there would nothing particular be,
Except that it's death by a certain decree.
As a tragedy lady is likely to view it-
The deed being dangerous, prompts her to do it.

Ismene 's her sister, and tries to dissuade her ;
Though her sister, she 'll neither assist her nor aid her.
Antigone says to her plan she 'll adhere,
And the ladies through opposite doors disappear.
A feeling classical rapture comes o'er us,
Which is smash'd when there enters a queer-looking Chorus,
With sheets on their shoulders and rouge on their cheeks ;
Though Greek in their guise, they are sad guys of Greeks.
Their fleshings, which ought to fit close to their shapes,
Are clumsily fasten'd with ill-conceald tapes ;
And if the theatrical text be relied on,
The skins of the Greeks were most carelessly tied on.
A chorus they sing—which is rather a long one-
But still in a musical point 'tis a strong one.
We don't very often hear anything finer
Than the beautiful change from the major to minor.
And swears, if the culprit's not found in a trice,
That in killing the Guard he won't be o'er-nice ;
A volley of threats at the fellow he fires,
And having exhausted his fury, retires.
The nobles, suspected of having a share
In this job, that has much of a black job the air,
In asserting their innocence take a wide scope,
By singing an Essay on Man, à la Pope.
King Creon comes in when the Chorus is done,
And hears that Antigone's self is the one
Who buried her brother. The deed she avows,
And then there ensues the most awful of rows !
Her sister Ismene is sent for, who cries
That she will die too if Antigone dies :
An assertion that's much more heroic than wise !

Alasj! her sincerity soon will be proved,
For both are in custody straightway removed.
He goes from the scene with a heart-rending cry,
As everyone fancies, to languish and die.
But no ! there is heard a vociferous shout,
And presently Creon comes smilingly out.
With gentle Antigone holding his hand
Together they bowing and curtseying stand.
Then Hæmon appears, not to bow, but to speak,
Announcing Antigone three times a-week.
“ No, no !" is the cry of applause and delight,
“ Not three times a week-every night, every night.”

He says,
COLLEGE OF GENERAL PRACTITIONERS.
A SCHEME, it appears, has been set on foot for the establishment of a
“ College of General Practitioners.” Now, since diseases, very generally,
are either imaginary, or such as would get well of themselves if let alone,
one highly important branch of General Practice is the treatment of
cases which do not require it. The General Practitioner, though not
a Consulting Physician, must consult his own interest.

but if the College Examiners are not saps, they may take a hint from

whom it may concern, is a little

Q. What should be the medical treatment of a common cold, which,
in fact, requires only white-wine-whey and a footpan.
A. Pulv: Antim: grains five, to be taken at bed-time; and Mistura
Feb: three table spoonfuls every three hours, with Emplast: Picis to
the region of the chest.
Q. If you asked a patient to put out his tongue, and found it perfectly
clean, what would you do?
A. Shake my head, and say, « Ah !” or “ Hum !”
Q. What is the meaning of “Hum,” Sir ?
A. It means," I see what is the matter with you."
Q. How would you look on feeling a pulse which proved natural and
regular ?
A. Very serious ; and I would pretend to be calculating.
Q. A lady, slightly indisposed, asks whether you don't think her very
ill— Your answer ?
A. I should say that she would have been so if she hadn't sent for me
in time.
Q. Surpose a patient, in perfect health, demands what you think of his
A. I should tell him, very mysteriously, that he ought to take care of
himself.
Q. An anxious mother, Sir, sends for you to see her darling child -
What would you first do ?
A. Begin by admiring it.
Q. How long, in a given case, would you send in medicine ?
A. As long as the patient believed himself ill.
Q. That belief being erroneous, what would you 'send, pray ?
A. I think, Tinct: Card: Comp: with either Aqua Mentha Pip: or
Mist: Camph:
Q. Be so good, Sir, as to translate the word “ Iter."
A. Five shillings.
A little philosophy then is bestowed
In the shape of a long argumentative ode,
The burden of which is the truth now confess'd,
That of policies honesty's always the best.
Now Hæmon approaches, and tries to assuage
Old Creon's, his father's or governor's rage ;
But Creon to yield to entreaty declines,
And Hæmon gives out some extremely strong lines :
6. There's no state where but one man commands;"
At which there's a general clapping of hands.
If Russia comes over to England again,
P’rhaps ALBERT the force of the line will explain-
Though e'en if he did he would do so in vain.
The King doth Antigone's presence command,
Telling Hæmon he 'li kill her directly off hand;
But Hæmon, who's not the most passive of sons,
Away in disgust from the governor runs.
The Chorus, their sense of his conduct to prove,
Begin a long strophe to Eros or Love.
Antigone enters, her fate to deplore :
The Chorus, who seem'd to have pity before,
Perceiving that hers is a desperate case,
Begin quite to chaff the poor girl to her face.
They talk of the glory of dying in youth ;
No doubt 'tis a great philosophical truth,
But nevertheless 'tis extremely unpleasant
To Antigone's ears at a time like the present.
She says that she looks now for pity in vain,
And when she goes off, we don't see her again.
A matter we've very good cause to regret,
For ne'er was a character better play'd yet
Than that of Antigone, (though 'tis a hard 'un,)
Each night by Miss VANDENHOFF at Covent Garden.
While Creon is taking it wondrously cool,
Sitting down on a throne which looks more like a stool,
A Seer comes in-though we're puzzled to find
That, though he's a Seer, he's thoroughly blind ;
* There's no understanding howe'er it can be,
That if he is blind this old Seer can see :
However, a course he coromences to take,
Which proves that though blind he is quite wide awake.
The conduct of Creon he boldly denounces,
For Antigone's treatment the monarch he trounces;
And having abused, to his utmost desires,'
The blind Seer (lucus è non lucendo) retires.
Then Creon begins to relent, but too late-
He cannot reverse poor Antigone's fate ;
He goes to release her-and then on the scene
Eurydice comes, the disconsolate Queen :
She hears both at once (what a terrible
Of the death of her son and Antigone too.
She hurries away with a furious run,
When Creon walks in with the corpse of his son ;
He makes it the subject of numerous speeches,
And each one a bit of philosophy teaches.
The Chorus, who've praised him and flattered before,
When they see that he's down, praise and flatter no more :
The circumstance really a library speaks
In proof that the earliest humbugs were Greeks.
He's getting exceedingly sick of his life,
When to add to his sorrow the corpse of his wife
Is shown through an opening made at the back
Of the stage, and his mind is of course on the rack :

THE PEACE SOCIETY.
We understand that the attention of this
excellent Society has lately been directed to a
subject closely connected with the cause of
peace, which is threatened by a regularly orga-
nised band of Italian adventurers. They seem
to threaten us with all the horrors of the Battle
of Prague, which caused the groans of the dying
to be heard in every drawing-room, and there
was not a seminary for young ladies into which
the roaring of the cannon did not penetrate. A
somewhat similar affliction now comes upon us
in the very streets of the metropolis, below the
very windows of our houses; and the Peace
Society will act properly in preserving as far as
possible the public tranquillity. We understand
that negotiations with this view are being car-

The loyal town of Kensington put forth

show was on the whole creditable to the
internal resources of that favourite suburb.
We particularly noticed the following :-
MR. COUTTS, High Street. Four Twelfth
Cakes with a chalk tulip show, each cake
having an image in the shape of a tulip
stuck on to the top of it.
MR. SPARROW, High Street. One half
of a very magnificent cake, sugared at the
top and sides, but without images ; and
another entire cake of smaller dimensions,
with a little figure of the Queen in wax
standing in the centre.
MR. NICHOLS. A profusion of small
cakes, with a cluster of buns picked out
with carraway comfits on a rich ground
of sugar. Also, a tasteful display of tea-
cakes piled up round a chalk bust of SHAKE-

church in Regent Street, within a hundred yards of the lantern of
MR. DRUMMOND. Only in London you have them all in much better
preservation—the noses of the New Road Caryatides are not broken as
those of their sisters here. The temple of the Scotch winds I am pleased
to say I have never seen, but I have no doubt it is worthy of the Modern
Athens-and as for the Choragic temple of Lysicrates, erroneously called
Demosthenes' Lantern-from Waterloo Place you can see it well: whereas
here it is a ruin in the midst of a huddle of dirty huts, whence you try in
vain to get a good view of it.
When I say of the temple of Theseus, (quoting MURRAY'S Guide-book)
that “it is a peripteral hexastyle with a pronaos, a posticum and two
columns between the ante," the commonest capacity may perfectly
imagine the place. Fancy it upon an irregular ground of copper-coloured
herbage, with black goats feeding on it, and the sound of perpetual don-
keys braying round about. Fancy to the south-east the purple rocks
and towers of the Acropolis meeting the eye to the south-east the
hilly islands and the blue Ægean. Fancy the cobalt sky above, and the
temple itself (built of Pentelic marble) of the exact colour and mouldiness
of a ripe Stilton cheese, and you have the view before you as well as if
you had been there.
As for the modern buildings_here is a beautiful design of the Royal

At Buckingham, everything assumed a gay appearance ; and we are
told by the ordinary reporters, that even the town gaol, which frowns
upon the passenger, had relaxed something of its wonted severity. What
right the town gaol has to frown at every quietly-disposed person who
passes it, we don't know. On this occasion its smile must have been as
sycophantic as its frown is impertinent.
The old pantomimic piece of nonsense, of offering the mace, was gone
through as usual, but HER MAJESTY's reply seems to have been rather
more curt than customary on these occasions. We don't wonder at it,
for we happen to know that HER MAJESTY has been heard to exclaim very
frequently to PRINCE ALBERT, just before entering a town,—"Now we shall
have that horrid Mayor, I suppose, with his great awkward mace. We
shall be dashed to pieces some day by the horses taking fright at it. Horses
don't understand these things. By-the-bye, it would be a good plan to
have a mace and a stuffed mayor kept in the stables, and hung up over
the mangers to accustom the animals, gradually, to them ; for I'm quite
sure that they always shy at the city maces and Mayor whenever they
come up to the side of the carriage.”
HER MAJESTY's answer, on
the occasion of the Buckingham mace being offered to her, was simply
a wave of the hand, accompanied by the words, “ MR. Mayor, I beg
you will keep it ;" which everybody knows is equivalent to, “ There, that

having taken it for granted that it is so, the writer of the

glass, as being very inferior to the stained glass of the
auction-room orator. The idea of the stained glass having
given "an impulse to the portico " is so purely ROBINSIAN,
and smacks so thoroughly of the catalogue, that there is no
mistaking its origin. Nobody but GEORGE ROBINS could
conceive the idea of porticoes being subject to impulses, and
of stained glass being the agents by which an impulse may
be communicated. We always thought glass was a non-
conductor, but it seems that when it is stained it has the
power of electrifying a door-way. Truly such an effect as a
portico under the influence of an impulse from some stained
glass “ should be seen to be well appreciated.”.

A Ballad made for the Delectation of all True Sportsmen.
PRINCE ALBERT is a sportsman bold,
Scarce had the earliest ray of morn
And eager for the chase,
On Stowe begun to break,
Out with the hounds, like GILPIN oft
A housemaid at the Royal door
He seems to ride a race.
Tapped thrice the Prince to wake.
And oft in Windsor's courtly Park
A sporting suit his Highness donn'd,
He loves to ply the gun,
On murderous thoughts intent
Where hares so well-bred are, that they
He sallies forth, his every look
Up to his muzzle run.
Betrays the sporting gent.
Now when HER GRACIOUS MAJESTY
With him went BUCKINGHAM, and he
To Stowe a visit paid,
MARQUIS OF CHANDOS hight,
(The newspapers contain a list
Arcades ambo : that is, both
Of all the cavalcade,),
Of Farmers the delight.
Scarce had the Royal pair arrived
Nor far behind, the portly form
At BUCKINGHAM's proud seat,
Of ROBERT PEEL was seen,
The Prince began in sportsman's style
His mind, less sporting than his coat,
The noble Duke to greet.
Is far away I ween.
“What shooting have you here, proud Duke?" LORD JERSEY followed, then some more
“ Shooting, Great Prince," he cried,
Whose names ill suit my rhymes :
“ Not vainly in my choice preserves
I 'll leave them out-you 'll find them all
I feel a housewife's pride.
At full length in the Times.
“One cover Guernsey Hill o'erlooks,
Five times ten keepers armed with sticks
Which more than all I prize,
Entered in close array,
As thick as thieves on Saffron Hill
And beat the cover, where the hares
Game in that cover lies.
Like lords in waiting lay.
And should your Royal Highness deign Once and again PRINCE ALBERT shot,
To shoot to-morrow there,
Once and again shot he ;
We'll have a battue which would make
The hare, that erst on four legs ran,
The oldest sportsman stare."
Now limped away on three.
« Agreed,” the Prince cried ;
Each keeper raised his stick and struck
I would I could begir
The hare upon the head;
To knock the game like ninepins down,
The Prince he shot, the keepers knocked,
And sporting laurels win.'
Until each hare was dead.
Dulce et decorum est, say some,
Pro patria mori,
And 'tis a fine thing for a hare
By princely hand to die.
'Twas this perhaps the game inspired
To court their Prince's aim,
They died to give PRINCE ALBERT sport,
And therefore they died game,
Ah ! ne'er I ween had Guernsey Hill
So dire a slaughter seen,
The field with dead and dying strewed
Showed what the sport had been.
How many fell, the Court Gazette
Better than I may say,
Hares that escaped will live to tell
Their children of that day !
Now sportsmen all, from this battue
An useful lesson take,
Hares beaten close together far
The finest shooting make.
What if some cockney, whose dull breast
Ne'er felt a sportsman's joy,
Cry, “Save us from those landlords who
Preserve but to destroy !”
Long live the Game Laws, though with ills
Some people say they 're fraught,
Long live the laws by which our Prince
Enjoyed such glorious sport !
And long may He live thus to get
An appetite for lunch,
And of his feats a full account
Send to the next week's Punch.

is the most important era in the modern world's history. It unites the
modern with the ancient civilisation ; it couples the brethren of Watt and
COBDEN with the dusky family of PHARAOH and SESOSTRIS; it fuses
HERODOTUS with THOMAS BABINGTON MACAULAY ; it intertwines the piston
of the blond Anglo-Saxon steam-engine with the Needle of the Abyssinian
CLEOPATRA ; it weds the tunnel of the subaqueous BRUNEL with the mystic
edifice of CHEOPS. Strange play of wayward fancy! Ascending the
Pyramid, I could not but think of Waterloo Bridge in my dear native
London--a building as vast and as magnificent, as beautiful, as useless, and
as lonely. Forty centuries have not as yet passed over the latter structure,
'tis true ; scarcely an equal number of hackney-coaches have crossed it.
But I doubt whether the individuals who contributed to raise it are likely
to receive a better dividend for their capital than the swarthy share-
holders in the Pyramid speculation, whose dust has long since been
trampled over by countless generations of their sons.

PUNCH'S SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT. ALDERMANIC ARRANGEMENTS.
COMPLAINTS are being continually made that
on certain occasions, when Aldermen are re-
quired to be present, they are frequently not
forthcoming At the sittings of the Central
Criminal Court, for instance, two Aldermen
are necessary to sit by the side of the Judge,
much in the same way as the lion and unicorn
are wanted as supporters to the Arms of Eng-
land. It is true that the Aldermen have nothing
to do with the administration of justice, or-to
use a theatrical term—are not required to be
practicable ; and a couple of property Alder-
men, or lay figures, would do just as well as
the living individuals. We understand that a
motion will be brought before the Court of
Common Council, authorising the preparation
of six Aldermen stuffed with straw, to sit as
dummies on those occasions when by law their
presence is required. Two will be prepared as
fixtures on the bench of the Central Criminal
Court, each with a newspaper in his hand, to
give the thing as much as possible the air of
being in strict conformity with the present

Into his wheel myself will put a spoke.

There 'll be a lot of legislative farces.

Oh ! A rich theme for gratulation offers ;

Carle d'un Reslaurant. Londres, 1845.
The volume now before us, mentally speaking, is, in plain
English, the bill of fare at a celebrated French eating-house
at the West End, at which we dined the other day. We have
no disposition to quarrel either with the contents of this book,
or the matters which they relate to ; but there is a certain
addition which, we would suggest, might, and ought to be
made to them. They require notes. It is true that opposite
to the French list of dishes there is an English parallel ; but
this, in many instances, is no translation at all : and, even if
it were, would be useless. What, for instance, is the ordinary
eater to understand by “Cóteleltes à la jardinière,"-chops
after the manner of the she-gardener. How is he to know
the peculiarities of the she-gardener's chops ? Among other
items in this work there is an "Epigramme d'agneau"; but
this, luckily, is translated, “ breast of lamb”; otherwise it
might be difficult to know whether the epigram was food for
the mind or the body. Another dish is, “ Rognons sautés au
rin de Champagne" - kidneys stewed in Champagne; still
great obscurity hangs over this stew. But what startled us
most, was a viand called “ Charlotte Russe aux fraises."
“ Charlotte Russe !” we exclaimed ; Russian Charlotte,
aux fraises," with strawberries! What dish is this !
Are we amongst cannibals, who, with her strawberries, will
have us eat the strawberry-girl ! To know merely the
English of these titles is unavailing; they are like portions
of certain Greek choral odes, which we can translate, but
cannot comprehend their translation. Let a full description
of each dish be given in the margin, or at the foot of the

particularly delighted to observe, in the dress circle, several white waist-
coats and Paris kids from the Parthenon Club House. The waistcoats
were looking very well, and the kids were got up in a style that did equal
honour to the hands of those who cleaned them, and those who wore
them. The Parthenon was very loud in its approbation, always starting
the first, and invariably ending the third round of applause. The number
of torn kids must have been immense ; but, to quote DOCTOR JOHNSON,
"the glove that would shrink from lending a hand to a five-act tragedy in
distress, is unworthy of the name of a man and the Parthenon !!!"

MEMBERS.
PUNCH'S MIRROR OF PARLIAMENT.
IRST DEBATE ON THE NAVY,--SIR C.
Napier, in moving for a Select Com-
mittee on the Construction of Ships,
was anxious to put upon the navy the
best construction possible. He (SIR
C. NAPIER) in looking at the 50.gun
ships, and taking them critically to
pieces, thought that taking them
literally to pieces was the best thing
that could be done with them. (Hear,
and a laugh.) An experiment had
been made by cutting down bad ves-
sels into good, but you might as well
cut down a worn-out Wellington into
an effective highlow. (Loud cheers.)
As to the 18-gun vessels, they had
gone through as many transformations
as a trick in a pantomime. Then
there was the Vanguard, which had
plenty of guns, but if she used them
she would set herself on fire. Then
there was the Queen, which his hon. friend MR. C. Wood was so much in
love with, that he ordered six more Queens, which would be in fact restor-
ing the Heptarchy. The Queen rolled easily, pitched easily, was strong.
built, but had never been seen scudding under a very heavy sea. He now
came to steam-boats. There was the Gorgon war-frigate, which was very
well adapted for running away but not for fighting, because it only had one
available gun, and that was more likely to hit the officer in command than
any other person. (A laugh.) He concluded by moving for a Select Com-
mittee to know what money had been voted for building ships, and what
the dickens had been done with it.
MR. HUME seconded the motion. He thought the worst-manned ship in
the service was the Surveyor-ship of the Navy. (A laugh.) Other nations
were quite leaving us behind in our ships.
SIR G. COCKBURN observed that if foreign nations left us behind in our
ships, it was because the foreign ships went first and ours ran after them.
(Hear.) He should oppose the motion.
Captain Rous would support the motion. He thought Sir W. SYMONDS
might be kept on as a watchman, to go round the dockyards and see all the
lights out ; but he was not fit to be Surveyor of the Navy. (Hear.)
MR. C. Wood began by saying he was very sorry, and he proceeded for
half-an-hour in a very sorry strain, amid general impatience.
ADMIRAL Bowles alluded to the DUKE OF PORTLAND having built the
Pantaloon to improve naval architecture, but the navy could not boast of
a pair of Pantaloons. (A laugh.) He (ADMIRAL Bowles) had himself
commanded the armament in the Shannon, which had distinguished itself
in the collection of the Irish poor-rates.
After a few more last words from Sir C. NAPIER, the House divided, and
the motion was lost.

A (THOROUGHLY) ENGLISI MELODY.

I'd give it him well, and cry “Don't shirk !”

By means according to the Laws?

By staying away from Parliament?
I'd ask him how the cash was spent !
And also say,

Of all his railing and abuse ;
His bulls so large, his jokes so small,
In his Conciliation Hall ?

ANGLING IN A THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE.
THE BATTLE OF THE RAILWAYS.
The railway mania is committing the most frightful ravages on
the senses of the people, and the most deadly feuds are springing up
between the various supporters of the different projected lines.
Every man who has got a ten-pound-note is rushing into the
market to purchase an interest in some thing or other which he
don't understand, but he is satisfied with the fact that an advertise-
ment has appeared calling the concern a railway. People are going
about purchasing little bits of scrip, as they would take a quarter of
a pound of tea, just to see how they like it, and every one is mad for
a share in something—with the name of railroad attached to it.
Even our boy has consulted us as to laying out his accumulated
pocket-money in the purchase of a Tours and Nantes, which is
temptingly offered at only seven-and-sixpence ; so that this cheap
little line may be considered as a railroad for juveniles.
Between those who don't understand railway matters and those
who do, the feud just now appears to be rather violent; for the

have been very disagreeable.
MISCHIEF FOR THE MILLION.
In consequence of the state of the law, allowing a person
to walk into the British Museum and smash the Portland
Vase for three pounds, it is possible that this sort of amuse-
ment may supersede the hitherto aristocratic amusement of
breaking windows and wrenching off door-knockers. A
morning's lark in the National Gallery would be cheap
at thirty pounds, if half-a-dozen were to club together for
the purpose, and the sum would include the privilege of run-
ning walking-sticks into six of the best pictures the collection
contains. We presume the law is left in this state for the
purpose of allowing the luxury of mischief to those who are
disposed to pay for it. Three pounds were all that the law
demanded for the amusement of breaking the Portland Vase,
or rather for breaking the shade, the latter being the only
article charged for, and the Vase being, of course, thrown
in gratis. It is not often that the law is so very particular
to a shade as it has been in this instance,
We should like to know where the three pounds came from
that were sent anonymously to pay the fine for the mis-
chievous donkey who smashed the precious article. No
doubt, if the money could be traced, it would be found to
have been supplied by one of the “ vulgar rich," who would
be happy to demolish the Elgin Marbles at so much a yard,
or take the Museum all round upon a reduced scale of
penalties.

were the units placed before the 0 O's, and with this material the lessee
went to work to do wonders with the great national establishment. On
the opening night George Barnwell was gloriously got through—as a farce
-by the three heavy old men, but unfortunately the fun of the tragedy
killed the pantomime, which was flat in the extreme after the unctuous
humour of the uncle, and the spicy rollicking raciness of the unfortunate
George.
In the course of the season an attempt has been made to put some of
the plays of SHAKSPEARE on the stage in a style in which they were never
done before ; and in this the management has succeeded to a miracle.
The experiment of seeing what the immortal Bard can possibly stand has
been tried to the fullest, or rather the emptiest extent.
Antigone was the next novelty, which was really and deservedly a hit ;
but as something was necessary for the off-nights, a new drama, under the
title of Honesty, was produced, which had a run of two nights, and was
revived a fortnight afterwards, when it had an interrupted run of four
successive hours.
The only other novelty was the Shadow on the Waters, the scene of
which was laid in China, where, if the manuscript lad laid also, it would
have been quite as well for the management. This, however, was
announced for every evening until further notice ; but the further notice
came in a couple of days, when it was intimated that the theatre was

NEW DESIGNS FOR THE FOUNTAINS IN
TRAFALGAR SQUARE.

Punch's Review.
Lloyd's List, 4to. 1845.—We have been favoured with a few copies of
this pleasant periodical, and we are happy to say that the nine thousandth
six hundredth and fifty-fifth number, which is now before us, fully main-
tains the promises which Number One held out to us. The opening article
has the taking title of the “ Wind at Midnight,” but the writer has not
made the most of this very fine subject. His article on the “ Wind at
Noon," is open to the same objection. Some remarks on the ketch,
Betsy, in No. 9612, are written in the right spirit. There is a nice tone
of humanity in the concluding sentence, which simply says, “ Crew and
part of stores saved ;"-a touching little announcement, which leaves the
reader to infer that the writer's heart is so full as to choke his pen's
further utterance. In the number for the 3rd of December, there is an
interesting anecdote of a cask, marked Ship Matilda, ship's stores,
provisions, which was left behind at Portleven, on the 30th November.
The articles on the mails are faithfully done, and evince a thorough
knowledge of the subject. We think the writer of the little tale of the
Anna Agatha, which “ in going off the patent slip to-day, sprung her
mizen-mast,” has hardly made enough of his material. COOPER, the
American novelist, would have given a whole volume to it.
In conclusion, we have only to say, that if Lloyd's List continues to be
conducted with its present spirit, it must become extensively popular.

RAILWAY POLITENESS.

from the guard; while the third class passenger will
experience a poke in the chest from the former with
his staff, by way of keeping him back till it is con-
venient to let him enter the carriage. In fact, there
are short answers as well as short trains, and each
class has a set of rules of politeness applied to it,
which the officers are bound to obey as scrupulously
as they do the Railway signals.
FIRST CLASS POLITENESS.
THE
THIRD CLASS TRAVELLER'S PETITION.
Pity the sorrows of a third class man,
Whose trembling limbs with snow are whitened o'er,
Who for his fare hias paid you all he can :
Cover him in, and let him freeze no more !
The classification adopted in the management of
Railways is not confined to the carriages ; but the
distinctions of first, second, and third class are
scrupulously observed in the degree of politeness
shown by the servants of the company to the pas-
sengers. The old maxim that civility costs nothing,
seems to be utterly repudiated by Railway Direc-
tors, who calculate no doubt that politeness at all
events takes time; and as time is money, the ser-
vants of the company are not justified in giving it
without an equivalent. Any one who doubts the

If he is going by the first class he will get speedy
attention from the clerks in the office ; bows, and

The second class passenger will get bare civility,

gentlemen in the public offices," whom the rail-
way clerks chiefly resemble in an assumed non-

a shareholder, is pretty sure to dissipate. A second
class passenger will get nothing more than a “Now,

THE POETRY OF WORSTED.
The two last acts were almost intolerably nauseous, for the actor,
whose talent only added to the repulsive character of the perform-
ance, kept arsenic constantly in view by the truthful but disgusting
picture he gave of a man walking about under its deadly influence.
The trashy absurdity of the affair, now and then, roused one from any
sense of its reality; and the idea of an invalid lying in his bed, with
a green bottle placed near a light so as to throw a deadly hue on
his features, was truly refreshing, for it brought to one's recollection
that it was only dramatic poison we were being dosed with.

with property, it will favour him in one sense-for it will make much

together may be questionable ; but this is a point we leave the
lawyers and the ladies to settle between them.
Tho Frozen Out Ducks.
20. The law favoureth a man's person before his possession. This is true
enough ; for the law will not spare a man's property, though it will
often leave his person unmolested. Thus, the law will not lay hands
on an idiot's person, even for felony, but it will lay hands on his
property, by taking the earliest opportunity of clutching hold of it.
21. The law favoureth matter of possession more than matter of right, when
the right is equal.—Thus, if two persons were to knock a man down
with the intention of robbing him, the law would, according to the
above maxim, favour the thief who managed to get possession of the
property.“ This,” says SPELMAN, " is the doctrine of first come
first served ; for if six people sit down to dine on a chicken, it is
clear that they cannot all take; but he that is first seized, or rather
seizes first, will be entitled, though the right of all was in the first
instance equal.” In the above case the remainder-man has no relief,
even though there may have been covin, for he has only a con-
tingent interest, which the estate-or chicken—may not be large
enough to satisfy.
22. Matter of profit or interest shall be taken largely, and it may be
assigned, but it cannot be countermanded. But matter of pleasure, trust, or
authority, shall be taken strictly, and may be countermanded.—This maxim
is somewhat long, or, as Coke would say, it goes great lengths :
for when it says matter of profit shall be taken largely, it seems
to hit at the law itself, which does certainly take as largely as it
can any matter with profit attached to it. If I allow a man to
walk in my park, he cannot bring any one else to walk with him, for

" At eight o'clock the grand jury entered the court with the last bill found.
“ The Judge remarked that it was an extraordinary circumstance that the witnesses in
Miss OSBORNE's case were not forthcoming."
Innocent Judge !
“An officer of the court said there had been one in court a short time since, but he
was half drunk. He went away again, and said he was going to look for some other
witnesses.
“ The Judge: It is an extraordinary proceeding. Let the whole of their recogni.
zances be estreated, with the exception of the policeman's; and the prosecutor can, if
he like, press the indictment at the next sessions."
The next sessions ! No, SERJEANT ADAMS ; never will Miss
OSBORNE such sessions see. The witness—the important witness-
will never again show himself. He will become a wanderer on the
face of the earth ; unless, indeed, he has miraculously and suddenly
obtained a purse whereby he may, in some small way, settle in the
world. Lucky is the witness who sees the evil-doings of the rich !
And in this way are Miss OSBORNES accused of stealing potted-
beef--and afterwards, in this way, do witnesses pot Justice !

THE STATE OF THE STREETS.
WHATEVER charge may be brought against the civic authorities on the
score of extravagance in other matters, great credit is due to them for
their very ingenious and economical method of getting rid of the mud in
the city. It has been calculated that by letting it lie in the streets, every
passenger becomes, as it were, his own scavenger ; each one taking away
on his shoes or boots a due proportion of the mud he walks into. This
is equitable as far as the public are concerned, and economical for the
Corporation. MR. Pattison, however, the city member, having an anti-
pathy to mud, will, it is understood, resort to stilts, as he is very apt to
put his foot in it.

Our readers doubtless remember that Miss OSBORNE—a woman of
wealth-was recently committed for trial, then bailed, on a charge
of stealing a pot of potted beef. The case bore a very ugly aspect
against her ; nevertheless, we were quite certain that her innocence
would triumph over all difficulties. The blacker the appearances,
the more lustrous would be her glory. We looked upon her as we

taken out of her reputation. And so it has been with Miss OSBORNE.
The ugly charge fastened upon her has been taken out, totally
discharged, by fullers’-earth of some sort. True it is, one of the wit-

For the New Generation,
ONCE upon a time there was an old king, whose name was King Dan.
This king had been very rich and powerful; but, as he grew old, his
revenue dwindled and dwindled away, and his hereditary bondsmen de-
serted him one after another, till at last he was left alone in his palace, by
the sea-shore, with his three sons and one old servant. This old servant
had been the court fool, and was called faithful Tom, or sometimes Tom

MR. BECKETT DENISON.
You have no right on me to throw a slur-

Allow me an apology to make.

I said " dishonestly," 'tis true,
And to a public board referred;
But meant not to apply to you,
Believe me, an offensive word.
RAILWAY RENCONTRE.
SINCE the appearance of our article," THE BATTLE OF THE RAIL-
WAYS," letters have poured in upon us from the north with almost
Niagarean velocity. The postman has reach our office in an
almost fainting state ; and we do verily believe that, as it is the last
feather that breaks the camel's back, so would one more letter have
crushed the overloaded Twopenny. Our readers will no doubt re-
member our reference to a disagreement between MR. BECKETT
Denison, M.P., and Mr. George Hudson, of high repute in the
railway world, which, by the bye, seems to be just now the world in
which every one feels an interest. It would seem that MR. BECKETT
Denison exhibits the same extraordinary pertinacity in considering
himself insulted, as was manifested by the illustrious Dogberry in
having himself written down an ass. The honourable member evi-
dently experiences a sort of satisfaction in being the object of an
insult; his feeling being no doubt akin to that of Maxworm, when
exclaiming, “I likes to be despised !”
An intelligent correspondent has favoured us with the following
version of the affair as it actually happened. There is something
of a dramatic tone in the proceeding, and as a scene actually took
place, the form into which the facts are thrown is the most
appropriate.

[MR. HUDSON retires from the carriage window, having found his

goes through several grand airs, which are not worth repeating
here, and the Scene concludes with the following
Enter MR. Hudson, singing.

Beckett Denison passes to a railway carriage, which he enters,
when there ensues the following :-
RINGING THE CHANGES.
MASTER JONES rang on Friday night several peals on seventeen different
bells in Fitzroy Square. This he cleverly effected, without any apparent
fatigue, by running from No. 1 to No. 17, and pulling the area-bells
violently, one after another. The tones were very distinct, and a beautiful
echo of each was heard in the drawing-rooms of the respective houses.
MASTER JONES, who is only nine years of age, wound up his masterly per.

bells of No. 18.
MR. HUDSON.

Though very long without it you remain'd ;
Although ’tis clear you would have had it not,
But that it was dishonestly obtained.

Dishonestly obtained ! what mean you, Sir ?

Oh! nothing personal, so don't mistake.

HE Battersea Fields were already
made only a little less classical
than the field of Waterloo by
the pistols of WELLINGTON and
WinChILSEA. Within these few
days, however, the spot has been
further consecrated to heroic
emotions by the gunpowder of
the son of HENRY Hunt (the
patriot of shabby memory), and
a gentleman connected with a
mercantile house in the city.”
(We have good reason for be-
lieving that he is one of the
hair-cutters at a house in Fleet
Street.) The Globe, from which
we take the thrilling details,
quotes from a Sunday paper. It appears that the gentlemen, at a
late hour on the preceding night, quarrelled at a tavern. The subject
of dispute was the nice distinction between Welsh rabbits and
rabbits from Wales. A Mr. B. MACKINTOSH, who is “both deaf and
dumb,” was Mr. Hunt's second ; and hospitably entertained him
at his lodgings; keeping him ready for the shooting hour, 7 A. M.-
near the Red House, Battersea,” a place already dyed with the
blood of pigeons. By some mistake, says the account,
" They were not called until some time after that hour, and it was quite eight when
they had reached the appointed place. They found that the other principal and second
had been punctual to their time, and after waiting for nearly hali an hour had gone
away. Determined, however, not to be disappointed, M2. Hunt sent for the gentlemen,
and they in a short time made their second appearance; but a difficulty presented itself,
which at first seemed insurmountable, namely, that the gentlemen returned without the
pistols. This, however, was soon got over by MR. HUNT, through his second, offering
one of his case to his opponent.”
An affecting incident this : and forcibly reminding us of the mag-
nanimity of the sailor in a Coburg melo-drama, who having a couple
of cutlasses under his arm, and meeting a defenceless enemy, hand-
somely offers him one of the weapons that they may take a chop
together! Well, “ the men being properly placed,” the pistols were
discharged, when-
“ The gentleman, whose name could not be learned, immediately fell to the ground,
and for the instant it was feared he was mortally wounded. To the delight of those
present, however, he got up after the lapse of a few seconds, and it was found the ball
from MR. Hunt's pistol had passed through the fleshy part of the right arm, and that
the bones were uninjured."
The hæmorrhage was soon stopped, and Mr. Hunt was satisfied !
Indeed the honour of both parties, having drunk a morning draught
of blood from the fleshy part of a right arm, was once again at ease !
After all, honour is not particular in the offerings made to her.
There has, hitherto, been a false notion that honour required aris-
tocratic victims ; that, like a rich and reckless harlot, she loved to
feast upon the highest and noblest things of the earth-on dukes,
marquesses, and so forth; indeed, nothing under a simple gentleman,
cured by duelling powder, could she at all digest. Now does it seem
that honour has a stronger stomach ; and can swallow anything even
from behind the counter. We yet hope to see the day, when honour
will, by no means, turn up her nose at a dustman or a cab-driver ;
either of them being killed in her name for “ satisfaction.” Seeing
that the practice of duelling is such exquisite foolery, why, we ask-
like any other luxury-should it be enjoyed only by the higher
classes ? We thank MR. Hunt and “the mercantile gentleman,"
and the “ deaf and dumb gentleman,” (we believe a riding-master,)
for doing all that in them lies to vulgarize an exclusive enjoyment.

am content with my own. I fairly, nay honourably fulfil the station

complacency, the reward of LAZARUS; confounding in its wretched-

Surely there will come a time when the Rich and the Poor will
fairly meet, and have a great human talk upon the matter ; will
hold a parliament of the heart, and pass acts that no after selfishness

A CONTRIBUTION BY COBDEN,
Teeth are included in the list of small articles to be freed from duty by Sir R. Peel's
proposed measure.

And Commerce lifts her drooping head
To contemplate the offer'd booty.

And thus the PREMIER'S scheme is rated :-

and now pleasantly lackadaisical. As our head altered with every
book that came from it, it was but fair, it was but commonly honest,
to the world—which meant our readers—that a new head should
accompany a new volume.
And then the Count—with characteristic perception--remarked
that our whiskers had wonderfully developed themselves since they
were last published in a bookseller's window. “Now, the whiskers
of a man of genius”-said the Count—"are public property. It is a
sort of moral embezzlement in an author to keep them to himself.
It is ungrateful to an admiring world—it is cruel to posterity.”
We were touched. We sank in our chair, and calling up the
author-look into our face, we bade the Count to do his worst. Of
course—as he always does—he did his best.
It is not for us to write upon our own head. No ; we feel it to be
a very delicate subject-indeed, altogether a very ticklish matter.
Were it otherwise, we might venture to direct the attention of the
beholder to the air of quiet sublimity that pervades our cheek-bone.
We might impress upon the superficial observer our eyebrow slightly
arched, as though suddenly required to bear the weight of a new
thought. We might speak of our mouth, in which there is so just a
combination of suavity and power. And then we might, with honest
pride, dilate upon our whiskers, wherein—and here, SAMPSON-like,
we will confess the secret to that Dalilah the public—wherein
consists our real strength of face : all this we might do—but we
will not.
Punch's Financial Scheme.
The great art of taxation is to get as much as you can, and to levy
duties on those articles which are likely to be the most productive. Now
the stamp on receipts is all well enough, but a stamp on bills would be
much better, for it has been ascertained that receipts are rare in propor.
tion to bills, for there are at the lowest computation at least one thousand
of the latter to one of the former. If it were compulsory on every trades
man to send in his bill upon a stamp, a much larger revenue would be
collected than can be obtained under the present system. Let any one
look through his own private papers, and he will find the preponderance
of bills over receipts to be very considerable, and when it is remembered
how very large a class are never in the habit of seeing a receipt at all, it
seems a piece of gross partiality to let the burden fall on the paying part
of the public, while the dishonest man who never settles an account, and
never therefore gives occasion for a receipt, contributes nothing to the
public income.
Society in general would also benefit by the proposed change, for trades-
men would not be so pertinacious in sending in their accounts where there
is no chance of getting the money—if a proper reduction in the shape of
a stamp were to be put upon the very obnoxious practice.

YOUNG ENGLAND'S LAMENT.
SCIENCE FOR JUVENILES.
We have received a ticket of admission to a series of Lectures on
Physiology and Physical Geography, to be delivered by DR. INLACH, at a
school-room in Sittingbourne. The Doctor is exceedingly moderate in his
demand ; for he asks only half-a-crown for the course from adults, and
he takes in children at a shilling. We should be curious to see the effect
produced by alternate doses of Physiology and Physical Geography on a
juvenile audience. He must administer the stuff on very homøopathic
principles, or the constitution of children would never be able to resist
the force of such a powerful opiate. The subjects of the Lectures are
given on the card of admission, which we have taken the liberty of
slightly varying, in order to adapt them to the infantine capacity :-
Distinction between the Animal and the Vegetable Kingdom_Cows
and Cowcumbers, Horse and Horseradish.
Animal Functions—The Duties of Donkeys.
The Properties of Matter. Song—“Oh, dear, what can the matter

THE PREMIER'S DREAM.
DEODAND EXTENSION.
LORD CAMPBELL has brought into the
House of Peers a bill for the abolition
of deodands. The use of a deodand is,
in steam-boat, railway, and other accidents
arising from somebody's fault, to teach
careless blockheads to mind what they are
about in future; human nature being so
constituted, that people, for the most part,
LALDERES prefer paying attention to paying some
thousand pounds. So far the law of
deodand is tolerably sensible, further than
that it is exceedingly preposterous, and
therefore we expect that their Lordships
will maintain it. For our own part, we
would not abolish deodands to any extent.
Turtle and venison often prove destruc-
tive to Aldermen; there ought, in our
opinion, to be a deodand on such turtle
and venison. BROUGHAM will certainly

A MIRACLE!
PENNSYLVANIA HAS PAID !-don't be alarmed—not her Debt, but the

the state, as became its strangeness, with ringing of bells, waving

In the city of London the excitement was indescribable. Feebly

CURIOSITIES OF PARLIAMENT.
ANOTHER NEW COMET.
In consequence of information we have received, we have made] it our
business to inquire into the truth of certain astronomical rumours that
are floating about respecting the discovery of another comet. It seems,
by a letter
in the Times from SIR JAMES South, that Mr. Cooper, who
had gone to Naples upon a comet-hunting expedition, saw something one
night in the clouds which induced him to call up his assistant, MR.
GRAHAM, and both of them having continued for some hours looking out
of window in their night-caps, made up their minds it was only a nebula,
and returning to their respective rooms they tumbled into their beds again.
Nevertheless one DOCTOR PETERS, who appears to be cock-a-hoop after any-
thing in the shape of a comet, heard of the affair and called on MR.
COOPER, when they all started off together to DOCTOR CAPOCCI,
another connoisseur in comets, and the whole party sat up all night
straining their eyes through telescopes, and quarrelling whether what they
saw was a comet or only a nebula. Dr. PETERS insisted that he had
pounced upon a nucleus ; while CAPOCCI affirmed positively that he had
got hold of a tail; but MR. GRAHAM fairly avowed his inability to make
either head or tail of it. MR. COOPER wrote over to SIR JAMES SOUTH,
who, instead of getting them out of their dilemma, says he must wait till
he can get a leviathan telescope before he can do anything, but after that
he promises that the Editor of the Times shall hear from him on the
subject. In the mean time we recommend that the matter should
be placed in the hands of the Detective Force, and that they should be
immediately empowered to take into custody any luminous body with a
long tail that cannot give a satisfactory account of itself. In Ireland
there is a body that, in some respects, answers the description, being
somewhat light-headed, having been distinguished for a long tail, and
being very eccentric in its movements. Some, however, believe that
this body will turn out eventually to be nothing more than a nebula, a
sort of misty cloud, which from the quantity of vapour proceeding from
it, is not at all improbable.

FANCY PORTRAITS OF MESSRS, PLUMTREE AND SPOONER.
The following little burst of bigotry occurred the other night in Par-
liament on the part of two worthies, named, respectively, SPOONER and
PLUMPTREE. Their names are singularly appropriate : SPOONER meaning
something more than spoon, while the PLUMPTREE produces fruit of a very
common and stony description.
The following were substantially the terms in which these two curiosi-
ties of the collective wisdom ” debated the question of Sunday railway
travelling :
Mr. PLUMPTREE referred to the practice of excursion trips on Sundays.
Hundreds and thousands of persons were frequently carried into towns
and suburbs on the Sabbath, to an extent which, in a Christian country, it
was fearful to contemplate.
Mr. Spooner earnestly concurred, and expressed his pious horror at
such a “ desecration of the Sabbath.'
MR. PLUMPTREE added that it was quite horrid.' He had sometimes, as
he was riding by in his carriage, seen several people walking about on
Sunday, breathing the country air, who must have come down by the
railway. He (MR. PLUMPTREE) really shuddered at the impiety.
MR. SPOONER fully concurred. It was the pleasure trains" he par-
ticularly objected to. Business trains might be necessary, for pecuniary
interests might be at stake ; but pleasure-trains, for a parcel of people
who only had recourse to them for relaxation, were an abomination,

THE LEGAL LION AND JACKALL.
THE ORIGIN OF HUMBUG.
DEAR PUNCH,
In strict confidence I will reveal to you—but mind it must go
To farther than yourself and subscribers—that I have made one of the
most important discoveries that ever startled a philosopher; and this is,
no less than the root, origin, and meaning of that most apt, vigorous,
peculiar, and popular expression-Humbug.
In vain had I consulted the lexicographers, what was the fundamental
idea of Humbug? I inquired of Johnson, RICHARDSON, WEBSTER, and a
host of other folios and quartos. They were either sensibly silent or
stupidly conjectural on the subject. I subjoin the result of my re-
searches
JOHNSON does not even include the term in his catalogue of the English
language.
RICHARDSON says, Humbug is probably! a compound of Hum, to cajole;
and Bug, a scarecrow.
WEBSTER (immeasurably the profoundest man of all in the scievce of
words) writes simply, “ Humbug, an imposition (a low word).”
Others of less note derive the word from the Latin Ambages, which

So the Prince journeyed on
jauntily, up hill and down dale, many and many a mile, and whenever
he felt tired he took out a curious bottle, inscribed with the talis-
manic letters, “K.I.N.A.H.A.N.S.L.L.," which was given him by Old
King Dan when he registered his vow; and which always refreshed him
so much, that after drinking from it he preferred veering about from
side to side of the road, thus doubling his journey. At last, towards

THE TAX THAT WILL NEVER BE TAKEN OFF."
Then the Prince knew that he alluded to the Income-tax, and he felt
inclined to despair. Sitting down, however, on the edge of the Fountain,
he applied himself for consolation to his talismanic bottle. It was now
night, the air was keen, and walking briskly on he came up with a poor
widow and her fatherless children, who looked very cold and hungry, and
were weeping and wailing piteously.
“My good woman," said the Prince, “what is the cause of your
distress?"
“Alas !” replied the Widow, "I lent all my little fortune to the Ame-

PUNCH'S STATUE.
So saying, the angry Prince left the American Slave-driver, (who looked
very much astonished,) and procured himself a comfortable lodging for
the night with part of the contribution he had received from him. The
next morning, early, the Prince set out again, and he had not gone far
before he overtook a funny fellow, with a curious cap on his head, which
had bells attached to it, just like the one your mama will show you in a
pretty print, called “ The Folly of Crime," and, as the Prince and he
were going the same way, they entered into conversation, and the Prince
had soon told his companion all his adventures, and how he felt very doubtful
of attaining the Utter Impossibility he was in search of. He then asked
his fellow-traveller what were his own pursuits, and if he could give him
any counsel or assistance.
“I am a Fool,” replied his companion, “and I think you are much
nearer to the object of your search than you fancy. For let us see
whether you have not fulfilled all the conditions the Pigeon imposed upon
you. When you found you could not cross the Bridge till the arrival of
the COMING MAN, did you not pass it over, and proceed to the next Impossi-
bility? And when told that you could not drink water there till the TAX
should be taken off, did you not produce your talismanic bottle, and
drink at the Fountain? Then, did you not receive from the American
Slave-driver, as a contribution in aid of your undertaking, the Debt which
should have been paid to the Widow and the Orphans ?”
“ It is indeed true," answered the Prince, who felt already much com-
forted by the Fool's reasoning, “ that I have done all this. Wonderful
Fool that you are !”.
“Take my advice, then,” said the Fool ; " and do not fear that

me; mine was the gift of a fairy, and has such useful qualities, and is
so appropriate to your enterprise, that you may well call it the Cap of
Repeal.' When you are at home again, present it, with my compliments,
to Old King Dan himself.”
So the Prince put on the Cap of Repeal, and thanked the Fool, and left
him joyfully to seek the Sweet Dove; and as he went, the peaks of his
cap fluttered gaily in the wind, and the bells seemed to be playing a
merry tune. În process of time, he found the Dove, who received him
very cordially, and asked him what progress he had made. Then the
Prince told the Pigeon everything as it had occurred; and said that he
PUNCH
hoped there was now nothing but the Pope of Rome's mischievous Bull
between him and the attainment of the Utter Impossibility. But to his
dismay the Pigeon answered,
“Prince, he was indeed a Fool who persuaded you that you had suc-
ceeded; you have not fulfilled any one of the conditions I imposed upon
you; for, has the COMING MAN arrived? Has the tax been taken off ?
And has the BROOM ever left the WOOLSACK ? Assuredly not : yet all
these Impossibilities must be performed, before you can approach the
others. So set out again on your travels over the wide world; but
keep up your heart, and doubt not that you will eventually obtain the
Utter Impossibility."
Then the Prince was very sorrowful ; and he fancied he perceived a
mocking tone in the Dove's last words, and even remarked that he lifted
one of his feet in a peculiar manner to the tip of his beak before he
flew away. So the Prince said (using the words of an old poet, who is
out of date in his own country, but whose pretty plays are popular in
France), “ that he doubted the equivocation of the Pigeon, who told
stories like truth."
Then he turned, and walked slowly home to Derrydown Palace, with-
out the talisman ; and as he went, the peaks of his eap waved mournfully
in the wind, and the bells seemed to be playing a melancholy tune. We understand a memorial, innumerably signed, has been presented to

THE CORPORATION TOURNAMENT.
BROMPTON IN DANGER!
MR. PUNCH,
I am a Bromptonian-a dweller at
the Athens end of London. I call upon you
for counsel and relief. There is a great brick
and mortar stir about us ; houses are rising
up like whole streets in a pantomime. Bromp-
ton air is resonant with the bricklayer's trowel!
We are shooting out at all points of the com-
pass. Well, of this itself I do not complain,
but of its dire effects. We are invaded by a
legion of doctors, brought hither by the car-
cases of houses. Every day brings a new ar-
rival : every night is made more horrible by
the accession of a red bull's-eye over the door,
indicative of the slayer within. The very air
is infected. We breathe nothing but rhubarb
and senna, and the prolonged effects of this
must be mischievous to all the inhabitants.
Counsel something—advise something! Is
there no law to indiet doctors as a nuisance,
when they shall be found more than three to
one of every parishioner? for such I firmly
believe to be the miserable condition of the
hitherto happy denizens of Brompton.
It has been thought peculiarly ungrateful of Lord Brougham—but what a man HENRY

MONSIEUR ST. GEORGE, a French dramatist, is
announced to be on the eve of arriving
in England, for the purpose of supply-
ing a programme for Balfe's next opera.
We should have thought that the pro-
gramme might have been sent over by
the post for tenpence, without Mon-
SIEUR ST. GEORGE being at the expense
of coming personally to England to
superintend the matter; which seems
almost as superfluous as if Day and
MARTIN were to go over to Paris with
a bottle of blacking to superintend the
polishing of somebody's boots with it.
However, as MONSIEUR ST. GEORGE is
coming, it is right that his reception in
this country should be on a scale com-
mensurate with his own genius, and
the heavy debt that, the English Drama
owes to him.
The Dramatic Authors' Society will,
it is expected, be foremost in giving
him a hearty welcome, and there are
even whispers of a dinner-though where it is to come from heaven only
knows-being offered to the French dramatist by the body alluded to.
In the event of the banquet coming off, the dishes will, of course, all be
taken from the French, in compliment to the guest; and from the skill
shown by some of the English dramatic authors in cooking up French
dishes, a treat may be expected. It is understood that Mr. Balfe will

only effect of laying on the water is to inundate and splash the public to
an extent that is truly frightful. When the fountains are in full play, the
slightest gust of wind blows a quantity of liquid over the passengers,
dealing destruction to their hats and bonnets. As it is found impossible
to stand and admire the playing of the fountains without being subjected
to a ducking, we should suggest that the Commissioners of Woods and
Forests establish a sort of umbrella station for the purpose of letting out
parapluies to those persons who are disposed to witness the grand exhi-

To paint the best of dogs and deer;
I would not care for glory, since
I pleased my Queen and charmed my Prince.
And yet I must not wish for that,
To paint my gracious Prince's hat,
To paint his cane, his gloves, his shoes,
To paint his dogs and cockatoos,
And nought beside, would weary me ;
And so I would not LANDSEER be.
Let famous EDWIN still be free
To paint his Queen's menagerie ;
Let Etty toil for Queen and Crown,
And princely patrons spoon him down,

When veterans are brought to shame

METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY.
A VERY interesting paper was read at the Meteorological Society a few
days ago, on the influence of the opening of Vauxhall on the weather of
the Metropolis. It was stated as a well-known and perfectly-established
fact that the actual opening of the gardens occasioned invariably a long
continuation of wet, which only terminated with the closing of the season,
and if an after-season was attempted-though the weather had in the in-
terval been dry- there was sure to be a return of wet till the final close of
the establishnient. There had, however, been some doubt as to whether
a mere announcement would have the same effect as actually opening the
gardens, and a singular experiment had consequently been tried. A bill
had been put out, promising to open the gardens at Whitsuntide, in order
to ascertain the fact, and it turned out that the weather became very
lowering. This, however, was only a temporary effect, and arose from the

Instead of being known as the First Life Guards, they must henceforth go by the
name of the First Insolvents. They are no longer part of the heavy horse ; but
will go down to posterity with their schedules in their hands as the Heavy
Defaulters. Instead of being present at fields, like that of Waterloo, their future
field of battle will be Westminster Hall; and the actions

light artillery of DoE and Roe will be brought into play
to deal execution among the harassed cohorts.

truckled to foreign foe, and could unflinchingly face
fire, should now tremble before a fieri facias. The word
“PENINSULA” embroidered on their banner must be
erased to make room for “ PORTUGAL STREET,” which
must soon be the watchword of this unhappy regiment.

little finger may be conceived. But to quiet alarm, we may state that
none whatever of this frightful torrent of galvanism, developed by the
NOTED LEG OF BEEFS ring, passes through the finger at all. To be affected by galvanism, it is
necessary that the part to be galvanised should lie between two opposite
galvanic poles or extremities; now, as the finger is inside the ring, the
galvanism is outside the finger. Thus, the finger is to the galvanic fluid
as a person standing on the Isle of Dogs is to the fluid in the Thames.
With what power an inappreciable force, ineffectually applied to the
extremity of the body, must act in the cure of such a complaint as
rheumatism, is obvious. In all positive diseases the Galvanic ring will
afford a negative relief; and those who have nothing the matter with
them may confidently depend on being cured by it.

in mind that there are spots in the sun, and that we can no more expect
perfect clearness in that luminary than we can look for the united graces
of style and diction, with an exactitude as to fact, in the productions of
the Court Newsman.
We are sorry to say, that in the chapter he threw off a few days ago,
there are some defects of a startling character. The opening passages of
the circular are in their usual felicitous style, and the author Alings about
his gems of history with a profusion that none but a Niebuur could
parallel.
There is a broad swelling tone of open narrative in the paragraph
about the GRAND DUCHESS STÉPHANIE going in company with the
BARONESS DE STURMFEDER and BARON ROTH DE SCHRECKENSTEIN to view
the Tower, while there is a gushy vivacity in the manner of telling the
pleasant fact, that " in the afternoon the GRAND DUCHESS visited her
daughter the MARCHIONESS OF Douglas.”
These characteristic and graceful touches, recording the influence of
the "home-affections," as GUBBINS in his MS. sweetly designates them,
are unsurpassed in their way, and in their manner unsurpassable !
But we must now turn from the tone of enthusiasm to the growl of
criticism, and ask the Newsman what on earth he means by saying that

that a noble old painter was so shamefully insulted. I believe that no
monarch in any Court of Europe, absolutist or constitutional, big or beg-

let us say—for fear of being personal-would dare to commit so gross a
breach of politeness. How, then, is it possible that the first of our
aristocracy (which is the first of the worlå), that one who is at the head
of our fashion-a model of generous good-breeding-one who must be a
pattern of courtesy-could so forget himself as to bring a veteran to
shame'? A great prince insulting a poor artist, is like a lifeguardsman
bullying a little baby. There is something cruel in the mere idea. The
poor thing can't resist : it was only meant for caressing and kindness, to
be dandled on the giant's knee, not pommelled by his great fist. A thrust
of his finger might kill the child. But what should we say of the six-
foot SAMSON who did the deed ?
“ The idea is revolting and impossible. The story must be absurd
from first to last. The first gentleman in England can't have done what
is alleged against him. To suppose that a great Prince should ask a
painter for a picture is possiblethe artist would naturally be too happy
to oblige such a personage, and send in his picture with pleasure. But
here all supposition stops. I won't believe that the first gentleman in
England begs a picture of an artist, and shows his sense of obligation by
sending him a tenth part of the value of the work. Such conduct is not
even decent; it is not merely deficient in common gratitude, but in com.
mon politeness. Much more, then, do I discredit the cruel charge against
my betters--that a great Prince, after having got a picture for nothing, after
having manifested his gratitude in the way named, should end by having
the picture taken down, and its place painted over by an inferior hand.
“ I say it is impossible. Between a great Prince and a poor painter there
is as much social difference, as there is bodily discrepancy between the

possible annoyance to the passengers. The rules, which are very simple,
are as follow :-
1. He that strikes a passenger in any part of his person, not being his
face, scores one.
2. He that strikes a passenger in the face with the flat side of the
“ cat,” scores two.
3. He that sends the point into the face of a passenger, scores three,
and is allowed one go more.
4. He that first scores 12, according to the above rules, is declared
winner, though the game may be won at a single “go,” by sending the
point into a passenger's eye, this being considered the grandest move
of all.
If there are no passengers, it is still possible to have a pleasant game,
by deciding that he who first sends the “ cat" through a neighbouring
window is the winner.

LORD ABERDEEN IN DANGER.
We begin to be alarmed for LORD ABERDEEN. We have always
considered his Lordship to be a very respectable, very heavy, very
conscientious sort of man. It was our belief that he always paid his
decent devotions to truth ; and was therefore sufficiently susceptible
to the good opinions of his fellow-subjects. This belief begins to
grow weak within us. We have parlous fear that “PEEL's dirty boy”
GRAHAM has been corrupting the Foreign Secretary. Sure we are,
that boy will be the death of the Cabinet, if PEEL do not look about
him. However, we subjoin the paragraph that has made us suddenly
anxious for ABERDEEN. A night or two since his Lordship said :-
"Altogether, I am accustomed almost daily to see myself characterised as pusilla.
nimous, cowardly, mean, dastardly, truckling, base. I hope I need not say that I view
these appellations with indifference; I view them, indeed, really with satisfaction ;
because I know perfectly well what they mean, and how they ought to be, and are, trans-
lated. I feel perfectly satisfied that these vituperative terms are translated as applicable
to conduct consistent with justice, reason, moderation, and with common sense; and I
therefore feel, as I said before, really not indifferent, but positively satisfied, when I see
such observations."
Now, we do not like a man to be satisfied at being called cowardly
and base; we do not sympathise with the satisfaction that sees
truth blackened and belied. We have no admiration for the states-
man who delights to place himself in a moral pillory; and, whilst
epithets noisome as ancient eggs are flying about him, we do not
venerate him for declaring that the missiles are fragrant, refreshing;
things that his nature most rejoices in !
But the fact is, LORD ABERDEEN is suddenly infected with a
morbid ambition to rival Sir JAMES GRAHAM. We are sorry for
this : for it is painful to see a man engaged in a hopeless task. There

THE USE OF THE CITY REMEMBRANCER.
We were dining, lately, on a steak. Absorbed in thought, we ate me-
chanically. In the meanwhile, an obscure sense of a want, something
like the half-consciousness of an uneasy doze, oppressed us.
It had wor-
ried us for at least ten minutes, when suddenly we were aroused from our
reverie by somebody asking us to hand the mustard. The mustard ! Ha!
that was what we lacked, and had forgotten.
Now dawned on our thus widely awakened mind a discovery which
we had often tried to arrive at. We perceived the utility of the City
Remembrancer ; it was as clear as daylight. The LORD MAror, im-
mersed in reflection, is eating venison. “My Lord,” says the Remem-
brancer, nudging him in the ribs—“Umph!” grunts the absent magis-
trate ; “ Currant jelly, your Lordship?" suggests the officer, handing
the condiment. Hey –What?-oh-ah-yes-hum !—Thank you,”
answers the civic dignitary. In like manner, on occasion, the City
Remembrancer may hint “Cold punch, Mr. Recorder, with your turtle?"
or, “Mr. Sheriff, don't you take cayenne and lemon with your whitebait ?"
“ Mr. Chaplain, ,-excuse me, Reverend Sir,you are eating your pheasant
without bread sauce! or, “Sword-bearer-Marshalman-Sir !--Gentle-
men! No soy with your salmon! what are you about ?”
To this notion of the functions of the Remembrancer it may be slightly
objected that the LORD MAYOR, Aldermen, and other members of the Cor-
poration, are not, whilst eating, accustomed to think of anything else. It
may be urged, that they do not usually combine rumination with masti-
cation, and are less subject to fits of abstraction than to fits of apoplexy.
But these are irreverent insinuations of jesting minds. The wits of

The piece will be divided into three great epochs, namely:

The first part will commence with the Blues carousing and giving them-

the Blues, who fall prostrate before his shrine, which will be represented

ODE TO SIBTHORP, BY THE POET LAUREATE.
NOTICE.
In the distant solitude of my mountains, the echoes of the great world
reach me faintly and seldom. But as the storm sometimes ruffles the
placid bosom of my lakes, the political tempest breaks over the Poet, too,
occasionally, and blows into commotion the placid depths of his soul.
It was on reading in my paper (the St. James's Chronicle, which, with
some friends, I have taken in for thirty-three years) the announcement,
by my admirable friend COLONEL SIBTHORP, that he was about to sacrifice
his life and his whiskers upon the altar of his country, that I felt a
tumultuous movement to me very unusual.
I bathed twice in the lake, and, having ascended Mount Rydal, I lay
down upon the topmost peak there, and flung my feelings into the fol-
lowing lyrical shape. I chose the Anapæstic measure, as best suited to
express the agitation of the subject of the sacrifice. The other metres
employed in the ode are of a calmer tendency, as the reader will see.
The Genius of Britain is made to interpose between our CURTIUS and
the sacrifice he meditates. That she may be successful, is the earnest

ma
ance,
Two respectable-looking individuals, who gave the names of HUNTER
and Sydney, were brought up on a charge of having been concerned in
giving unlicensed theatrical entertainments in the neighbourhood of the
Old Bailey. Lord W. LENNOX was the first witness examined. He
stated that he was a great friend to the drama, and was very fond of thea-
trical entertainments. Had heard that some performances were about to
take place at the Old Bailey, which he, Lord 'W. LENNOX, thought would
prove very interesting: Was anxious to witness these performances, and
applied for an admission for that purpose. Went and saw the perform-

who is, witness believes, a great patron also of the drama. Has not a
box at the Haymarket. Sometimes goes to Drury Lane. Believes Drury
Lane is the only national establishment because Mr. Buna says it is.
DUPREZ and Madame GARCIA are singing there. Some dancers with long
foreign names are now dancing there. Madame TAILLON is announced to
sing there. Has seen operas by DONIZETTI and Rossini there. M. St.
GEORGES, a second-rate French dramatist, is engaged to write an opera
there. Witness means to say that these things have taken place, or are
to take place, at the only national establishment.
The Court here interfered. This examination had nothing to do with
the charge against the persons at the bar of having been engaged in
giving unlicensed theatricals. The counsel for the prosecution, after
consulting with his client, stated that this witness could not prove having
paid any money to see the performance, and some one else was necessary
to sustain that part of the charge.
JOSEPH SNOB was then called. Witness went to the Old Bailey for amuse-
ment. Always went when there was anything very attractive and good.

You have quite mistaken the feelings of British artists, when painting
for the court and aristocracy: I refer you, sir, to the Life of Wilkie, in
which you will see how perfectly well that great painter understood his
position; in which you cannot fail to remark how very small he made his
soul that it might fittingly correspond with SIR ROBERT PEEL; addressing
him about an immortal picture, as though he was treating for the job of
whitewashing an outhouse. This, sir, is the proper spirit to animate the
British painter ; and that it does animate him, is to me a glory and a
consolation. Sir, we love to be kicked ; it sends the blood up to our
hearts, and makes us paint with the proper spirit of independence.

Thou art my boy, my pride and joy,
Of chivalry the model ;
And yet the sense is not immense

What cause hath wrought thy rambling thought
This martyrdom to think on ?

Retain your head, my son, and prize
Your face above all money :

So dolorously funny.
Ah, never cause those meagre jaws!
To lose their tufted glories ;
And never shave that face so grave,
My Champion of the Tories.

PUNC-
PUNCTUALITY IS THE SOUL OF BUSINESS.
THE MYSTERY OF MEDICINE.
WE perceive that Mr. Muntz has given notice of a motion
requiring all medical practitioners to write their prescriptions in
English, and to put plain English on their gallipots. If this proposal
is adopted, the dignity of Medicine is gone, for on the principle of
omne ignotum pro magnifico, people fancy that a prescription must do
them a wonderful deal of good if they cannot understand the
meaning of it. Who will have any faith in medicine when he
knows the ingredients ?
There is something mysterious in Duæ pilulæ factæ cum pane, but
when we come to know that it means nothing more than “two bread
pills,” the senses revolt against the idea of deriving any benefit from
taking them. Besides, when a medical man is in a hurry, and does
not know exactly what to prescribe, he can always with safety scribble
down Aq.-Cochi.--pan.-Sen.-Mag.–Cort., and the apothecary, if he
has any tact, will send in something harmless, with directions-at
his own discretion-about the mode and period of taking it.
But if all prescriptions are to be in English, what on earth is a
medical man to do when he wants to prescribe nothing at all, but a
dose quite at the discretion of the chemist. We knew a facetious
general practitioner who used to jot down quod-plac-mi-form-car,
which looked very well in abbreviated Latin, but which was in short
-or rather in full-- quodcunque places, mi formose care-(whatever you
please, my pretty dear;) a prescription the chemist always under-
stood to mean water with a dash of senna in it, to be taken at bed-
time. We entreat Mr. Muntz to pause before he strips medicine
of that mystery which gives it half its importance in the eyes of the
multitude. As to anglicising the gallipots we defy the best linguist
on earth to translate into English those mystic syllables which are
painted at random with a view to variety, and without the remotest
attempt at meaning..

THE QUEEN AT DRURY LANE.
DEAR BUNN,
The Queen visited you last week, on which occasion, I perceive,
you raised your prices. Very right. Yours is the proper kind of loyalty,
and therefore you make money by it. Besides, it must be so gratifying to
HER MAJESTY to learn that she is made a show of—that royalty is
exhibited at so much a head to its loving subjects. I hope MADAME
TUSSAUD will take the hint froin you, and for a time at least raise her
prices of admission on every new accession of royalty. As you sing in
your own beautiful verse-
" When hollow hearts shall wear a mask,"
it may be very proper for the said hearts to sham loyalty,—but your's is
the true thing: there is no mistaking your love for the throne, since you
have the extra shillings and sixpences to show for it.
Yours,

ANALYSIS OF THE MAYNOOTH DIVISION.
The Times has furnished an analysis of the Maynooth Division, founded
on the alleged political creeds of those who voted, but we humbly beg to
suggest that in these days it is quite impossible to make any calculation on
such very uncertain data as a Member of Parliament's politics. Conser-
vatives, Whigs, and Radicals are now mixed up in as great a jumble as a
pack of cards immediately after what is called a good shuffling, and there
has been so much political shuffling of late that it would be very difficult
to get the pack sorted as it formerly used to be. Perhaps the shorter
method of division would be into trumps, court cards, and knaves or
jacks-in-office-which are the principal means employed in the ordinary
tricks of politics.
At all events the divisions into Conservative and Whig are becoming
almost as obsolete as Ministerial and Anti-Ministerial. There should be a
class of Would-if-they-coulds, to represent the Young Englanders, and, to
return to the simile of the cards, the sixes and sevens might very
appropriately typify the Tory party.

Tue Aylesbury Board of Guardians have reduced the salary of the

A DESIGN FOR A STATUE OF THE BRITISH LION,
BY SIR CULLING EARDLEY SUITH,
The English Press.
MR Punch,
Being a journalist, I am not a gentleman—the Post says so.
Of course I venture not to repine. A Pariah, blackened by printers' ink,
I meekly surrender my nose to be pulled by any of the nobility and gentry
so inclined. I shall not even grease it, lest the unguent soil kid gloves. I
am also ready to be kicked. It is my duty. I am a humble man. Loving
my duty, I like to be kicked.
A poor despicable creature, I belong to that miserable set who sway
the mind of Britain. What, then, should I look for but iosult, contempt,
foul names? I submit to be called a liar. I will publish it in my own
paper, if any gentleman wishes it. What am I that I should set myself
against a gentleman's whims?
I pretend to no sense of honour-to no emotion of manhood. I and my
brethren were only made to crouch like beaten hounds beneath the lash
of any Honourable or Right Honourable Gent., who may do us the honour
to flog us.
We do not pretend to enter into respectable society ; we hope we are
not so presumptuous—God forbid ! We know our place better. With
deep reverence do we bow County Members. Most serf-like do we
crouch before anything like the shadow of a lord. We resent not the
sneer of the aristocrat-no, nor of the parvenu—no, nor of any man who
chooses to sneer at us. All may do it, and welcome. Our nature is to
endure, our mission to stoop-to stoop, not to conquer.
Humbly avowing this—with bated breath whimpering forth my meek
unworthiness – I venture to apprize the nobility, gentry, and my patrons
in general, that, should any one wish to insult me, I shall repair bare.

THE EXCELLENT NEW BALLAD OF MR. PEEL AT TOLEDO.'
Says Bulwer to Peel,
“ This note where my seal
And ambassador's arms are displayed 0,
Is big with a freight
Of secrets of weight,
Concerning a town of Tolaydo.
"Tis a delicate job,
And I've chosen you, BOB,
And beg you will hasten with speed 0,
And deliver the note

He says,
“So quit your cigars,

And haste and fulfil

“ Some pangs I may feel
To part,” says young Peel,
“ From music, and woman, and weed O !

And say—“Monsignor,

At the gate, and imagine what they do ?
The rascals approach
To examine the coach
As it stops at the door of Tolaydo !
“ Let go my barouche,"
With a scream and a push,
Says Peel, as they ventur'd the deed, 0.
And, inspir'd with disgust,
His pistols he thrust
In the face of the men of Toledo.
“ Have a care, my signors,”
The gentleman roars,
As fierce as a Western tornado,
“ Approach my coach panes,
And I 'll blow out the brains
Of each carabineer in Tolaydo.
I swear with an oath
To murder I'm loath,
But if ever you venture on me_do;
With powder and ball
I'll murder you all,
As sure as you live at Toledo.”
The Carabineers,
They heard him with fears,
And stood, in their glory arrayed, 0 !
All formed in long lines,
With their big carabiness,
Across the main street of Tolaydo.

Says the Captain. For what,
'Gainst fifty can one such as he do ?"

The peace of the town of Tolaydu."
Young Peel, at his frown,
Was fain to look down,
As mute as a fish or torpedo ;
And, looking sheepi'sh",
Says “ It wasn't my wish
To kick up a row in Toledo."
It wasn't for quarrels
That these double-barrels
From out my coach-door were displayed 0;
But to ask if a pistol

And bade the young hero proceed, 0!

And make the banditti to bleed, 0.
With powder and ball,

guise of a brooch of

fairy form was invested
in ten guineas, repre-
sented by a slip of lilac satin ; and this was overlaid by thirty guineas
more in two skirts of white lace. Tastefully disposed down each side of
the latter, were six half crowns ; which so many bows of purple ribbon
had come to. The lower margins of the thirty guinea skirts were edged
with eleven additional guineas, the value of some eight yards of silver
fringe a quarter of a yard in depth. Her taper waste, taking zone and
clasp together, I calculated to be confined by forty pounds sterling.
Her delicately rounded arms, the glove of spotless kid being added to
the gold bracelet which encircled the little wrist, may be said to have been
adorned with twenty-two pounds five and sixpence, and, putting the silk
and satin at the lowest figure, I should say that she wore fourteen and
sixpence on her feet. Thus, altogether, was this thing of light, this
creature of loveliness, arrayed from top to toe, exclusively of little
sundries, in six hundred and forty-eight pounds eleven shillings.

ANGLING EXTRAORDINARY.
Silk BUCKINGHAM and GEORGE JONES are the WALTON and COTTON of
the British and Foreign Destitute. They have lately been angling for a
President with a perseverance that has at last met with its reward, for
they have hooked the DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE.
The line they used was a line of invitation, which always attracts the
attention of the very odd fish alluded to. Like good anglers, they had
plenty of corks, and the bait consisted of all the usual ingredients of a
good dinner. When thinking of SILK BUCKINGHAM and GEORGE Jones
angling for CAMBRIDGE, we paturally think of Swift's definition of the
sport, “ A stick, and a string, &c." ;
When BUCKINGHAM is fishing for the British and Foreigr, he uses a
variety of gentles and simples, as a list of the members of the Destitute
will convince any one who looks at it; but when a royal fish is the prize
he has in view, it is necessary to bait the hook with something of a more
substantial nature, and CAMBRIDGE has been caught accordingly.

LORD BROUGHAM'S NIGHT-MARE.
We have received the following distressing communication from LORD
BROUGHAM. His Lordship is evidently very bad, and it has always been
our wish to make him better : but we almost fear that he is too far gone
to allow of much good being done for him.
The following letter will, however, explain the condition of the learned
sufferer :-
“ Dear Punci,-Understanding that you have a reputation for being
able to cure the very worst evils, I write to ask your advice under the
following circumstances :-
“I am subject to a species of night-mare in the shape
of a very heavy oppression at my chest, as if a steam-
engine was cutting right across me, and my whole body
were intersected by various lines of railway.
« I hear all sorts of noises--steam-boilers appear
to be bursting in my
ears; valves seem explod-
ing under my very nose,
and pistons work before my
eyes with a force there is
no accounting for. I make every exertion to release myself from the distressing burden, but I
find it utterly impossible. By telling me what to do, you will greatly oblige
“ Yours faithfully, BROUGHAM."
We are sorry we have no advice that we can give his Lordship which he is at all likely
to take. Our opinion is, that he ought to keep very quiet; but this we know is impossible.
DEATH OF AN OBSCURE IMPOSTOR.
“And is Young Double dead ? "
We have to announce the demise of Young England : Yes ; the pet of Burlington
Street is gone the way of all waste paper! With ourselves this questionable calamity
has caused no surprise-and we have hardness enough of heart to confess it,- very
little regret. And for this reason; the thing was a shabby thing from the first. Its
promised birth was announced shabbily, suspiciously. At least half-a-dozen advertise-
ments—all at five shillings each-declared to the world that a new power was about
to be born, which, like a new ST. GEORGE, would put down humbug and pretence of
to every kind, and regenerate fallen England,
-that is, if geniuses would answer to the
call, and, like the fairies of old, give each a peculiar grace or faculty to the coming
babe. And nobody answered! And the child was born-poor, little puling thing !-
now me and christened, at the inkstand of New Burlington Street, Young England ! And then
it was songht to put off the bantling upon various members of the family of that name.
But Ben D'ISRAELI publicly declared that it was no child of his ; Mr. ŠMYTHE loftily
pooh-pooh'd it ; LORD MANNERS blandly told the impostor to go to the cheesemonger.
And thus, disowned by all, Young England puled and squealed on for a few weeks, and
is at length no more ! Some declare that the proximate cause of its death was inani-
tion ; and some gin-and-water on the brain. On this we venture no opinion : but
simply inform the world that Young England, a weakly newspaper, has gone to the tomb
of all the Humbugs !
Guds We understand that Mr. BENTLEY, touched with peculiar sympathy for the loss,
intends to erect a monument to the memory of the thing in the new literary cemetery,
which—as we stated in a former number is about to be established. MR. BENTLEY
has, with excellent taste, selected the following epitaph for the blighted flower :-
“ Ef so soon that I was done for,
I wonder what I was begun for.'

Song of the Merchant Tailors.
BY A LAUREAT EXPECTANT.
PUNCH'S NOY'S MAXIMS.
52. Certum est quod certum reddi potest. That is certain which can
be made certain.—There is no rule without an exception, and this is
no exception to the rule that there is never the latter without the
former. For instance, there are certain laws which never can be
made certain of, and we hear of certain legal decisions of a most
uncertain character.
53. Voluntas est ambulatoria et non consummatur usque ad mortem testatoris.
The will is ambulatory, and not consummated until the death of the
testator.—The legal meaning of this is, that a man may alter his
will until he is dead; but the common-sense translation appears
rather to be, that a man's will, in the hands of the lawyers, is mere
Walker-a term which the Latin word ambulatoria seems to justify.
As to his will being consummated after his death, that depends on
fate and the Prerogative Court, which helps sometimes to carry out
the old English maxim of—“Where there's a will there's a way;"
for it often happens, that where there is a will, the law makes a-way
with the property.
54. Nemo potest plus juris ad alium transferre quàm in ipso est. No one
can transfer to another more right than he has himself.—This is
true enough ; but if no one can give another more than he has got,
he sometimes gives another more than he has bargained for. The
law did not, however, always recognise the force of this maxim, but
used to treat people as if they could give more than they had got ;
for it would put people in prison for not paying what they had really
not got to pay; and thus, though common sense said, “You cannot
have blood out of a stone,” the law would say, But we will try it
on, at all events.” If by law no man can give more than a certain
quantity of right, there is no limit to the amount of wrong which the
law will assist him in distributing.
55. Nullum tempus occurrit regi. No time runs against the King:- This
maxim simply means that the sovereign shall never lose his right by
laches; but he may take his own time in asking for what belongs to
him. With ordinary persons,
He that will not when he may,
When he would he shall have nay.
But the sovereign may behave like a fretful child, and begin to cry
out-"Oh! he's got my property,” at any distance
of time, though he may have stood by for years, and
silently seen another enjoying it. In such a case, the
law, through the voice of the Chancellor, exclaims
“ Hallo, you sir, you've got something belonging to
the sovereign.” “I thought he didn't want it, for
he wasn't using it," is the natural reply. “ Come
come — no nonsense, you must drop it,” cries the
Chancellor, “ for nullum tempus occurrit regi.” “I
thought time and tide waited for no man,” rejoins
the defendant. “I don't know anything about the tide,” cries the
law_always through the Chancellor ; but the sovereign is never
tied to time; so, unless you want to get yourself into a scrape, you
had better drop that property,” This of course leaves the unhappy
victim no alternative, and the sovereign takes his own back again.
Our Law Maxims are now brought to a close, and we trust that
the wise saws of our fathers-saws, by the bye, with tolerably sharp
teeth—will be rendered intelligible by some of our modern instances.
We shall conclude with an ode to Noy, supposed to have been written
by an individual called the humorous SIR ANTHONY WELDON,
whose only authenticated joke consists of a clumsy bon-mot on the
name of Nov,* which is too obvious for us to make allusion to. The
ode was short and simple, but no less touching on that account :

“ Of bis goose he made a horse,
To ride up and down Charing Cross,
And so the Field Marshal went prancing away.'
."- Old Song
Huzza for the Thimble, huzza for the Goose,
And the Shears that our countrymen brandish!
Commanded by ALBERT the gallant and spruce,
They will beat every artist outlandish.
The halo of glory encircling the Trade
Must confound every scoffer and railer,
For ALBERT a bold Merchant Tailor is made ;
Yes ; our Prince is a true British Tailor.
Let Army and Navy together combine
In addresses of congratulation,
For their uniforms soon, though already so fine,
Will exhibit some new decoration.
Improved in costume, as they rush to the fight,
With one voice will each soldier and sailor
Exclaim, whilst their bosoms swell high with delight,
Oh, our Prince is a true British Tailor!
Sing, daughters of England, sing fal de ral lal,
Let bright anticipation inspire you ;
For fashions more elegant very soon shall
Deck the handsome young men who admire you.
Who sues to a fair one should sue in his best,
That's the plan that's most likely to nail her ;
How nicely will lovers in future be drest,
Now our Prince is a true British Tailor !
Super Saxony now with Saxe Coburg's proud name
Is united ; long, long may they flourish!
And long live their Prince in all honour and fame,
Of his country the fashions to nourish!
Let Taste rear the banner of broad-cloth unfurl'd,
And Britannia step forward to hail her,
And the Spips of old England shall cut out the world,
For our Prince is a true British Tailor !

MUSICAL MONARCHS.
We are told by a newspaper paragraph that among the souvenirs
RUBINI carries away with him from St. Petersburg is “a crown of
massive gold, inlaid with eight or ten massive brilliants of immense
value." What on earth can RUBINI be going to do with this crown?
He can't wear it in the streets, nor can he put it on to go to a party in.
Perhaps he is in treaty for some petty German state, which he purposes
buying out and out, subjects, revenues and all ; in which case he will
want a crown in the way of business as an appendage to his sovereignty.
We know that German kingdoms are sometimes very cheap, and may be
had for a mere song—which RUBINI could at any time give-while the
“coming in” is seldom very expensive, for it is only necessary to take the
fixtures, including the throne, at a valuation, and pay something in the
way of good will to the out-going sovereign. A German principality may
be had for about the price of a good London milk-walk, and RUBINI being
about to retire may be on the look-out for a cheap and eligible throne to
spend the remainder of his days in that style of pasteboard dignity which
his triumphant career as a vocalist must have made him accustomed to.

As we see the elevated ass, we may think of the strange manner in

beget in us useful thought-may make us for the nonce wiser and
sadder men : now, the only feelings excited in us by the hooting,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Punch's Sporting Intelligence.
THE NEW OPERA OF "THE ENCHANTRESS.”
AT DRURY LANE,
The poet Bunn has added another quire to that crown of foolscap in
which his head is enveloped, and the Enchantress must be subjoined to
that list of lyrical efforts enshrined from time to time on the walls of the
Temple of the Drama by the paste of the bill-sticker. Scarcely has the
public recovered from the bewilderment into which it was thrown by the
startling announcement of the poet Bunn, that
“Hollow hearts may wear a mask,
'Twould break your own to see,
when he bursts forth with another new and original opera," abounding
in "more nuts to crack" for the amusement of those who think it worth
while to take the trouble of cracking them. Almost every one must have
seen a lock in BRAMAH'S window in Piccadilly, with a label offering a
hundred guineas to any one who will find an instrument that will open the
lock alluded to. The poet Bunn has beaten Bramah all to atoms, and we
intend to prove our assertion by banging up in the window of our office
the following notice.

This very ingenious dance has for some time past excited the admiration of all who have witnessed it. The exactitude with which Peel and his colleagues have imitated the movements of RUSSELL and
the Whig figurans is really astonishing. Not a move or a turn of the latter has escaped the vigilance of the former, who has given so close an imitation, that it is almost impossible to distinguish the copy
from the original. The exhibition has been carried on hitherto with much success, but the public are apparently beginning to get a little tired of it, for the transparency of the trick renders it almost too obvious.

after a few moments, having assured to himself a decent gravity of
face, the Deputy-licenser began. He said—“Gentlemen, knowing

capacity to have about as much affinity to English dramatists as have
the check-takers on the playhouse stairs. Doubtless, however, I
was in error; and must henceforth feel that the Chamberlain's

THE ROYAL PORTRAIT PAINTER'S FORLORN HOPE.
WONDERS WILL NEVER CEASE.

The poet BUNN, when he is not writing a libretto, is accustomed to let
his rampant imagination run riot in his play-bills. There is a good deal
of fancy in his allusions to certain alleged fits of enthusiasm into which
audiences are said to have been thrown by the rhymes of the poet BUNN
himself; but a day or two ago, there was a passage more deep and
mysterious than usual. In telling the public that he had had a good
house on Whit Monday, the poet frankly terms it “ an extraordinary
overflow;" but, what was still more extraordinary, even than the over-
flow at Drury Lane, was the announcement that “in consequence of the
great attraction of the Bohemian Girl and La Giselle, they will be
repeated for the last time this evening."
The great attraction of a performance is a strange reason for leaving it
off, and indeed almost as strange as making its non-attraction a reason
for keeping it on, as was the case, probably, with the Daughter of St.
Mark, the last-no, alas ! not the last-contribution of the poet Bunn to
the national lyric drama.

we are indulged with MR. ETTY's idea of Aurora

but we object to the notion of giving Zephyr the
scarlet fever, so evident in his over-ruddy face ;
while the inflamed cheek of a little Cupid in the
group is indicative of the boy being a severe
sufferer from teething.
The next object that arrested us in our scamper
was No. 66. Portrait of Mrs. Thwaytes, in which a
lady is beautifully contrasted with some very new
and gaudy furniture. The back-ground exhibits
a pier-glass and console-table, of the very last
fashion in upholstery; and there is a chair in the
fore-ground which seems to have walked out of
TROLLOPE's window in Parliament Street, in
whose show-room the artist has apparently laid
his scene.
No. 77 is called Whalers, by J. M. W. TURNER,
R.A., and embodies one of those singular effects
which are only met with in lobster salads, and
in this artist's pictures. Whether he calls his
picture Whalers, or Venice, or Morning, or Noon, or
Night, it is all the same; for it is quite as easy to
fancy it one thing as another. We give opposite
two subjects by this celebrated artist.
No. 93 is A Study from Nature, consisting of a
bunch or two of grapes and a wine-glass. The
student of nature may be allowed to study
grapes; but a wine-glass would come rather

"
USE AND ABUSE OF THE 662"
The penny-a-liner is sometimes touched with strange tenderness
towards the scoundrel of respectability, for assuredly there is such an
animal, and a wicked pest he is. This “conscience and tender
heart” was a day or two since strongly developed by the reporter of

before the unaccountable GIBBS with robbery :
“It appeared from the reluctant statement made by the young woman, that CAPTAIN

that, finding his intentions were not honourable, she had left the town and come to
London to avoid his importunities ; that the Captain followed her to town, and per-

his trunk, just as she was getting into an omnibus."
Now, if Private Potts or PrinGLE had been guilty of such
infamy, he would not have been treated with the tenderness of

have been very abominable indeed. The way in which the case was
disposed of is no less edifying-no less encouraging to scoundrel
captains, wherever they may be.
“The Captain sent a certificate to the Mansion House stating that he had no inten.

And so, at the Captain's wish, the LORD Mayor thinks no more of

somewhat strong evidence against any one not in the habit of dining with

carrying about with him. “ After considerable discussion,” says the
report, “Mr. TWYFORD said he would treat the charge as one of having
tendered a counterfeit coin by mistake, and ordered the prisoner to be
discharged.” This decision was a dreadful drop down from the high tone
of impartiality which the magistrate had assumed at the outset of the
proceedings. However, everybody seemed to be infected with the
amiability of MR. TWYFORD, for even the complainant "offered his hand”

The arrangement of Nos. 171 and 172, bespeaks a genial spirit of
waggery in the hanging committee, for they have placed a very spoony
young gentleman playing on a guitar immediately over a picture with the
words, What a beauty ! on the top of its frame. So that the exclamation,
What a beauty! appears to belong to the spoony young gentleman. We
trust that it is not a portrait-for if it happens to be one, it must be hurt-
ful to the feelings of the spoony young gentleman and his family. By the
way, talking of portraits, the present exhibition swarms with them, and
we caught several ladies and gentlemen blocking up the thoroughfare by
standing wrapped in admiration before their own effigies. Next year we
hope all the portraits will be put together in a single room, so that the
parties interested may know where to find them.
The R.A.'s of course claim our especial attention, and we therefore
notice MR. A. COOPER's 19th of June, 1815– A Scene in Belgium. The
scene consists in an old soldier-already sentimentally drunk-taking a
glass of something short from the hands of a female. Whereabouts in
Belgium this scene occurred we are not told, and as it did not powerfully
interest us, we shall not dive very deeply into the Belgic annals to
inquire.
It is to be regretted that MR. HOWARD, R.A., is not prohibited the
use of paint-brushes. It is painful to see such things emanating from the
Professor of Painting as the Sketch from Southey's Thalaba. The motto,
“ Away! away! away !” is the only good point connected with the
picture. The words come naturally to the lips of all who look at it.

COMPLAINTS.

PREFACE.
An individual calling himself, by advertisement, a clergyman of
Cambridge University, and professing to practise medicine “from
benevolence rather than gain,” — the Reverend scholar by “gain,"
meaning, we apprehend, the desire of gain-has written a book with the
above title. We never read this book, and do not know what it is like ;
but we know how we should write such a volume were Punch a reverend
practitioner ; only, we must confess, we should do it for gain rather than
from benevolence. Something like the following would be

What a boon it would be to humanity were there a remedy for Nervous
and Mental Complaints! The value of this boon is incalculable, but
some idea of it may be gathered by inquiry of the Rev. Dr. Punch.-

CHAPTER II.

of circumstances reveal this discovery to its author. Those circumstances

CHAPTER III.
Dr. Punch, a clergyman of Cambridge University, having been twenty
years afflicted with a Nervous or Mental Complaint, discovered a method
of curing himself; and now offers, from benevolence rather than gain, to
cure others by means, which will be communicated to any sufferer who

Such is the difficulty of obtaining members to sit on Parliamentary

HINTS FOR THE NEXT EXHIBITION.
IN consequence of the difficulty experienced in seeing those pictures at the Royal
Academy, which come literally under the head of high art, from their being
placed just below the ceiling, it is to be hoped that next year ladders will be intro-
duced for distribution among the visitors. Every artist should be bound to deposit
a ladder with the door-keeper, on sending in a picture likely to take a very elevated
position on the walls, if not in the opinion of the public.
In order to meet the views of the artists, it has been proposed to appropriate the
rooms of the Academy to certain classes of pictures, devoting the rooms, according
to their sizes, to the three or four sorts of works that have formed the great bulk of
all the exhibitions for the last ten years. The largest room of all will, of course, be
devoted to portraits ; and it is proposed to save space by hanging one before another,
so that the person wishing to look at the portrait underneath—which will probably
be his own-may lift up the portrait that happens to be placed directly over it. The
inner room will be set apart for “ Vicars of Wakefield.”
The great staircase might serve admirably for the miniatures which in their
present place only fatigne the eye, from being too near, while if they were hung on
the walls of the vestibule, no one would feel bound to take the trouble of looking at
them. The historical paintings might be placed at the back of the man who takes
the umbrellas and walking-sticks, who could explain what the pictures mean, a
desideratum which is not supplied generally by the artist. Considerable difficulty
having been experienced in seeing some of the paintings in the octagon room, or

We regret to hear that the ancient and
honourable order of Temple Waiters, com-
prising the old original esquires of the foren-
sic knights or crusaders of Pump Court, is
likely to become extinct. The same civilising
spirit which has driven the red man into the
West, is fast hurrying the white-aproned man
away from the East, and the Temple Waiters
will soon be added to the Allobroges, the
Cimbri, and other lost tribes whose names
now figure in the pages of history. The

In a word, it is too bad that the regular

these men should be discarded from the Tem-

Cambridge's English Speaker.
The frequency of the DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE's appearance at public
dinners, where he of course occupies the chair, and is called upon to
speak very often, has the effect of making his Royal Highness a perfect
master of the arts of eloquence.
It is, we believe, the intention of the DUKE OF CAMBRIDGE to publish a
new “ English Speaker," including a number of after-dinner orations appli-
cable to all sorts and descriptions of charitable purposes. The collection
will include several of the Duke's own powerful bursts of eloquence, of
which we are happy to have the privilege of giving a few specimens.

wickedness, “that degrades art to the purpose of caricature, and
renders personal the satire that should be only universal." We feel
the blow: it falls upon our back with the weight of a goose-down
feather. The castigation is incidentally dealt upon us in a notice of
the labours of Kenny MEADOWS (to whom be all health and honour !)
It is true, Punch is sometimes personal. His dealings are, at times,
with the knaves and simpletons of the world—the knaves and
simpletons in chairs of authority-and, whenever truth calls for the
right word, why, be it ever so hard a one, that word is administered.
But the Art-Union has no such serious mission. The Art-Union is
established as a twelvepenny temple, whereto men are invited that
they may therein ponder on the beautiful ; where there are no
politics, no social iniquity, no want, no human suffering to ruffle and
distress the prejudices and sympathies of the reader. In the Art-
Union personality would, indeed, be a foul thing—a very toad in a
porphyry temple. And therefore, even as the most delicate lady
would avoid the aforesaid reptile, therefore is personality avoided by
the Art-Union : let the reader judge from the following extract,
taken from the very same number as that in which Punch is
belaboured-

THE STATESMAN'S DREAM.
A TALE FOR SIR JAMES GRAHAM.
THE WRONGS OF THE POSTMEN!
We have received the following petition from an important section
of the female kind ; namely, the wives of the postmen—(poor under-
paid pilgrims !).—The said petition was agreed to at a very numerous
meeting, though we have not seen it reported in any contemporary
columns.
I chanced that on a night, of late,
Exhausted with a long debate,
To bed a Statesman crept ;
His Settlement of Paupers Act
Had been the theme ; yet, though the fact
Is strange to tell, he slept.
He slept ; but in a moment more,
This Legislator for the Poor
Woke in the world of dreams;
That shadowy world of joy and pain,
By fancy fashioned from the brain,
With imaged thought that teems.
He slept, a Minister of State,
One of the wealthy and the great,
Mature in years—not old ;
He woke a feeble aged man,
Whose days had reached their utmost span,
Poor, ragged, wretched, cold.
An old wife, too, had he; and they
Were slowly tottering on their way,
A distant home to seek;
The only home that they had left,
Of house, and goods, and friends bereft:
The WORKHOUSE, truth to speak.
It seemed an age of travail sore
Until they reach'd the Union door,
In sick and weary sort;
A surly Beadle mock'd the tone
In which they made their pitevus moan,
And bade them cut it short.
And then they went before the Board,
Who on their heads reproaches pour'd,
For lazy, worthless folk ;
The Statesman in that dreamy maze,
Some memory had of better days :
His heart felt nearly broke.
And then his wife was from him torn,
And then his hoary head was shorn,
And then they made him don
The Workhouse dress, that every eye
Might see he was a pauper by
The garb that he had on.
They gave him, faint for want of meat,
Some gruel and a crust to ent.
Oh, it was sorry stuff!
But of that “coarser kind of food "
When for a little more he sued,
They cried, “You've had enough.”
And when his heart was sorely wrung,
And bitter words came to his tongue
Beneath his treatment hard,
They lock'd him in a prison-cell,
In lonely wretchedness to dwell,
For brawling in the ward.
The jarring lock his slumber broke,
And to reality he woke,
A warm and downy bed :
Now will this Statesman's dream have taught
One GRAHAM anything-or nought ?-
That's more than can be said.
To Her Gracious Majesty the Queen : The Humble Petition of the
Wives of the Postmen.
“Madam,
“ May it please your gracious goodness to look with a smiling
eye upon the husbands of your Petitioners. Your gracious goodness
supplies to 'em from the Crown a coat, a waistcoat, and a hat with a band
which only the illiterate multitude take for gold. Your Petitioners pray
that the Crown would not leave off at the waistcoat, but continue its
bounty in the way of trousers, and end it with shoes. Then would your
MAJESTY's Postmen be all of a piece. As it is, half of your MAJESTY'S
Postmen belongs to the Crown-and half to the Jews. They get their
coats and waistcoats from the government, and (saving your MAJESTY'S
presence), their trousers and high-lows from Holywell Street !
“ If your Petitioners' husbands were like mermaids, and never but
half-showed themselves, your Petitioners would not approach you with
their distressed tale,- but as your Petitioners' husbands are often respecto
able about the shoulders, at the same time that they are seedy about the
toes and knees, your Petitioners pray that you will be graciously pleased
to make their husbands all alike.
“ Your Petitioners humbly appeal to your MAJESTY's sympathies as a
wife. What would be your MAJESTY's feelings to see PRINCE ALBERT in
the fine laced coat of a General (or a late Twopenny), with shabby trousers
and boots pot fit for any painter to take him in ?
“ Your Petitioners would not distress your MAJESTY'S feelings by
dwelling on the dreadful sight, but again entreating that your MAJESTY
will give orders that all—instead of a part-of their husbands
forth be the care of a maternal government, so that in future they may
not complain of half-measures on the part of the tailor,

2. An ill-paid overworked labourer, with a mind as bare as his body,
a dog-hole for a dwelling, and an union-house for a refuge.
3. An ignorant tenantry, with a confidence in Sir ROBERT PEEL and a
blind dependence on protection and the landlord.
4. A non-resident rector, with a taste for Cheltenham waters, and a
notion that the working clergy are composed of curates at £80 per
IRELAND.
1. An absentee proprietor, who considers hedge-shooting the natural
amusement of the Irish pisantry; believes the only “genteel” residence
for a man of taste to be an English watering-place, and holds the duties of
property to be all on the side of the tenant.
2. A Protestant ascendancy parson, who looks on Orange Lodges as a
development of the Christian church ; " Boyne water” as a hymn; and
a National School as a favourite parade-ground for the Evil One.
3. A rack-renting agent, whose favourite argument is a policeman's

small holdings, and a tendency to promote Emigration on a large scale by whom they were about to separate. One old veteran, who took them

A PORTRAIT SOIREE.
The abundance of portraits that are being exhibited at the Royal
Academy may furnish a valuable suggestion to those who are in the habit
of giving expensive parties ; for all the objects of visiting may be accom-
plished without any of the cost or inconvenience. Considering how little
requiring either intellect or animation goes on at a fashionable soirée, it
is quite clear that people, who wish merely to see their friends, might
derive quite as much satisfaction from seeing their portraits.
If every person invited to an evening party might send his likeness as
a substitute for himself, a great deal of unnecessary expense would be
saved in the way of dress to the guest, while the host would not have to
lay out money in entertaining him. A portrait soirée would at least be
something new in the fashionable world, and if only on that account,
there is every chance of its becoming popular in the higher circles.
Some idea may be formed of the effect of such an assemblage from the
present aspect of the rooms at the Royal Academy; and, as many go to
parties only to have their appearance canvassed, by having themselves
canvassed before they went, much trouble would be saved to those who
make it their business to criticise.
