“W ELL, Gentlemen, I'm very glad to see you both,” said the genial and sportive Sage, pushing a box of picked
Tremendidos towards his distinguished guests, “and I shall be delighted to hear your best news. How have
things been going with you?"
The host eyed his visitors benignly as he addressed them, and Toby sat up all attention. The visitors looked at
each other with a smile, and there was a short pause.
Then the American spoke.
“Wal,” he said, stretching himself out with comfortable satisfaction, “I am inclined to think, Sir, that the
business I have been doing is not burstin' bad. That there hoss I sent to your Epsom Downs I guess would do credit
to a Greased Lightning Company, of which the Chairman had not been officially got at."
“He would,” said Mr. PUNCH, heartily. “Iroquois is a fine creature, and his form at the finish on the cele.
brated First was splendid."
Toby wagged his tail approvingly.
“You air a generous people, and no mistake,” replied Uncle SAM, acknowledging the high compliment with an
affable bow.
“And I think we are not less so,” interrupted the Frenchman, with a placid smile. “Did we not greet your
Forhall with oorahs, unmixed with the chagrin matural to defeat?"
“You air the politest nation of cusses outside Wall Street on settling day that I have had the pleasure of meeting,”
returned the transatlantic courtier gracefully, with a sly twinkle in his eye.
“We are,” replied the Frenchman, with confidence.
“And what is more,” threw in the Sage cheerily, “you have among you, Monsieur, those to whom defeat not only
brings, to use your own phrase, no chagrin, but to whom it is positively salutary."
“Yes, Bitters is real grit; that's sure," continued the American, reflectively; “and the worst-mannered Opossum
that I ever knew intimately, had had his training mostly on meat Molasses."
“There was not much stay in that crittur, I calculate," rejoined MR. PUNCH, relapsing into the purest Bostonian
accent, with good-humoured urbanity; “yet the best judges will sometimes put their money on strange brutes—eh,
Monsieur le Président *"

There was a general laugh, and Toby barked merrily.
“Well," said the hero of Cahors, accepting the sally with genial dignity, “I admit, to use the language of your turf,
that I may have dropped heavily with Scrutin de Liste; but I have something in my stable with more stay in him. Oui,
Monsieur, I tell you I stand to win the plus grand priz of all, with Dictateur. Come, voyons, will you give me your odds?”
He pulled out his tablets as he spoke.
The American produced his book.
“Stay," said Mr. PUNCH, intervening, as they were preparing their pencils for business. “Put those things up,
and make sure of your money. Whatever odds you give or take, there'll be a loss somewhere."
“Parfaitement,” responded the coming President.
“You are right, Sir,” echoed Uncle SAM.
“Why, cert'nly,” rejoined Mr. PUNCH, with much confidence. “I have had some little experience in book-
making, for I have a settlement every six months; but, whatever events may have come off in the interval, I invariably
win largely.”
The host rose, and took from the pocket of a sporting-coat a package carefully done up in silver paper. His
distinguished guests watched his movements with respectful interest.
“You do invariably win 2" asked the President of the Chamber, in a tone of thoughtful inquiry.
He was answered by a Parisian bow. The American nodded his head in cute approbation.
“Then, Sir," he said, “I calculate that that there book of yours is always a certainty f"
The Prince of Book-makers smiled, and unfolded his parcel.
“Always," he said, disclosing something very attractive in green and gold as he spoke; “and, if you would like
to see how I manage it, here you are ' "

ALL ABOUT IT.
(From Our Irritable Catechist.)
Question. Well,—have you seen the Queen's Speech yet?
Answer. I have. Here you are:-
My Lords AND GENTLEMEN, -
I have received really handsome Christmas Cards from Mr.
PARNELL and nearly all the other Great Powers of Europe.
GENTLEMEN of THE House of CoMºMoss,
You will have, whether you like it or not, as usual to pay
for everything. -
My Lords AND GENTLEMEN,
My Government will submit to you a proposal for the more
º settlement of Irish landowners in the Cannibal
S.
They are also º; a measure which will enable me to
cover the whole of this discontented portion of my empire with
wood pavement; an arrangement which I confidently trust will,
under the superintendence of an experienced Stage Manager,
afford to popular agitators ample and agreeable room for their
uent performances.
ou. also be called upon to consider the nature of fog.
—And that's all.
Q. Thanks. And now, who on earth are the Boers?
A. Half Dutch; but in their present, attitude, just equal to
Double Dutch; and evidently on their own Dutch mettle.
Q. What do they want? -
A. More Potchefst-room. Anything. Everything. How should
I know. Perhaps BARTLE FRERE's head! - --
Q. Pº me, you surprise me. By the way, who is Sir BARTLE
A. An escaped South-African Emperor who has written to the
Times. In early life he was a Mastodon Minstrel, but now he is to
º: seen daily, from ten to four, anywhere for nothing. Will that do
or you?
Q. Thankyou, capitally, And now can you tell'melſr. FonstER's
very last joke about the withdrawal of Lord Chief Justice MAYP
A. Certainly. He said that though justice in Ireland had often
WOL. Lºxxx.
- been measured out to order, he had no wish himself to see it ready
mau'd.
. Quite so. And on the point of this being fully explained to
the PREMIER at the last Cabinet Council by all the Members in turn,
did he see it and laugh?
* A. No, he didn't.
*Interrogator. Thank you. And now I think that that will perhaps
be enough for this week!
TEMPERANCE AND TRUTH.
DR. EDMUNDs in a letter to the Times, has advanced the claims,
and motified the merits of the London Temperance Hospital, to which
he is Senior Physician. The rule enforced in this institution, although
“the medical staff are in no way restrained from the use of alcohol,”
as an exception, is that of the entire disuse of spirituous and fer-
mented liquors in both food, and physic; in fact, the practice of
Total Abstinence. Now, “Temperance” is “moderation opposed
to gluttony and drunkenness.” As synonymous with Total Abstin-
ence, and opposed to Moderation, the word Temperance obviousl
conveys the insinuation that Moderation is Intemperance. *
ossible success to the London Temperance Hospital, and to a similar
§. about to be established in the Hampstead Road; but let
things be called by their #! names, and not anything by a name
which implies an illogical fib.
Unseasonable Announcement.
ſº Times' City Article the other day contained the statement
that—
“There has been more business done in Mincing Lane than usual so near
Christmas.”
Of course, for the mince pies, of which, perhaps, many more than
usual were eaten. Good!
By NEW YEAR's EVE,
A GENTLEMAN of whom we hear a great deal to-day is “Tom
Orrow.”

OPENING OF
PARLIAMENT.
INTRODUCTION OF A FIFTHIPARTY.
º
* T * \ * * * *** ***
THERE is one member of this establishment who, with the excep-
tion of a little work done in the Christmas week, has passed a long
life of idleness. We allude to Toby, and will add, that we no longer
intend that he shall bear the reproach of being a lazy dog. Casting
about for some means of occupying his time with credit to himself
and benefit to mankind, we have determined to make him a Member
of Parliament. He will represent us chiefly; but as prejudice must
be respected, and it is necessary for Members having seats in the
House to derive their title from some recognised constituency, we
have determined to return him for Barkshire.
Of course, it would have been equally easy for us to have sent him
to Parliament for Punchestown, the Isle of Skye, or even the Isle
of Dogs, . But apart from the circumstance that these places are not
enfranchised, a county is more respectable. Toby l, therefore,
sit for Barks, which we give notice to Parliamentary humbugs of
all sorts, will not be worse than his bite. In politics Toby has strict
instructions to be a Punchite—that is to say, he will speak what he
thinks, regardless of Whig or Tory, Radical or Conservative, Home-
Ruler or Fourth Party. “Tros Tyriusque mihi nullo discrimine
etur” will be his motto, to the disappointment of superficial persons
§. will at once suppose it would be “Cave canem '''
Toby has already been favoured with notes from Mr. GLADSTQNE
and Sir STAFFoRD NoFTHcote, informing him that Her MAJESTY has
been pleased to fix the Sixth of January for the assembling of Parlia-

ment. It is added that “business of the first importance will at once
be proceeded with,” and it is hoped it may suit Toby's convenience
to be in his place on the day named. Toby begs to inform his dis-
tinguished correspondents that it certainly ". But it may saye
trouble and tº." e-stamps if, on the eve of taking his seat, the
Whips on either side are once for all advised that they need not send
to the Fifth Party reminders to be present and vote on occasions,
great or small. He will always be in his place, and will vote as he
pleases, being animated solely by a sense of his duty to his world-
wide constituency and his life-long master.
It is a general practice for the Whips on either side to assist in the
ceremonial of introducing new Members. In the case of the Member
for Barks, an arrangement has been come to which will, we trust
prove satisfactory to all, and will clearly stamp his position of
perfect independence of party. He will be brought up to the table
to take the oath, by the Leader of the House, and the *i; of the
Opposition; As this is a circumstance unparalleled in Parliamentary
history, it has been found desirable to have a rehearsal of the scene,
which enables us in advance of the meeting of Parliament, to
a sketch of the historical incident. -
We shall next week publish our first extracts from Toby's Diary,
which, under the usual heading “Essence,” will be continued from
week to week throughout the Session, and will probably throw a
fresh and cheerful light on Parliamentary Proceedings.

MORE FROM MADEIRA.
SIRTI am making a tour of the world, which I dare say you
.# know is round, and have only just got the papers of a year
and a half ago. In one of them I find that you have informed a
Cºrrespondent, by means of a post-card, that in your opinion “the
office of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod might coiseivably be
dispensed with without entailing the destruction of the Empire.”
Nºw, Sir, as I am not in my place in the House of Lords to im-
P. §. for this atrocious language, and as I don't think, that
ord SALISBURY would undertake the job if I were to write and ask
him, I am forced to tell you that a Minister of your high gifts of
eloquence cannot be supposed to be indulging in idle platitudes.
Qu were not on your first hustings, nor indeed on any him; at
all, when you made this ominous remark. You were then, little
thºugh you might think it, inaugurating a levelling and destructive

me as a politician.

follow me there; and as I only happen to have with me a sixpenny
abridgment of Mrs. Markham, #. I could show Å. that the
office of Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod is indissolubly bound up
with all that is high and holy in our Constitution. - - - -
I will only add that I conceive in all humility—a quality which is,
£hope, conspicuous throughout this letter—that a Minister of the
łown is bound to show respect to any and every office and institu-
tion in the land,-the bad as much as the good, if not more, You
may . urge that this would render all reform impossible, and
all pro s of reform treasonable, and so it would. shº

Impossible Inconsistency.
SIR WILFRID LAws9N has, of course, not thought it necessary for
him to repudiate the declaration ascribed to him in divers reports of
a recent speech of his :–
“Rather than see my fellow-subjects in Ireland drenched in blood and
crushed down by the military, I, for one, will heartily go in for a separation
from England.”
It must appear to anybody far too absurd to be credible, that the
idea of a possible Repeal of the Union could ever have been contem-
Rºº. in any circumstances by the President of the United Kingdom
ance.

FROM THE RANKS.
I.
“Badged and Badgered.”
*SIR,-You'll excuse me
º º intrudin', but as I'm a bit
of a scholard for my rank
NA in life (which mustn't be
º confounded with the “Load
N of Hay” at Paddington,
N where I’m usually, to be
found), I've bin asked by
Nº my pals to put it to you
A straight that there are
other noosances about town
- to tidy up besides cabbage-
Nº stalks. e London Cab-
A bies are a useful body of
A men who ought to be con-
A sidered, and maybe, just to
A begin the New Year with,
º if you'd take our part, we
A should be more respected
º and less nagged at.
º There’s no end, Sir, to
the º we’re ex-
A pected to accept smiling.
And we do smile a won-
derful deal considering—
but let’s just shovel our
coals on, and think out our
"Wºº proper.
- - We've bin told the com-
pany of horses was demoralising, therefore we're all, a bad lot to:
gether perhaps; but I never heard that engines were depraving, did
you? But, bless". heart, what’s the use of argifying P. I never
argue when an old lady waves her, umbrella at me. I only admire
the prospect on the other side of the road, I'd just like to have a
bit of chinwag with you on the quiet about the true and real troubles
of a Cabby, and if you’ll promise to help to put 'em right, I’ll be
lad to drink to luck at your expense. Grievances ! There are
eaps of 'em, surelie; some false, some a deal too real. Think o'
the long winter nights, with no one to talk to and nothing to drink,
and nobody to carry, and nothin' to think of but the last little row
with the Missus; and then there's the police, who are our natural
enemies, and staik us as they do the stags up north, and enjoy the
stirring of us up when we’re doing no harm whatever; and the
fares who have no consciences and no milk of human natur, and are
disgracefully ignorant of distances but pretend they’re not; and the
old girls who want to be called “milady,” and would like a footstool
and a glass of water and an inspection of all the sights between
St. Paul's and the South Kensington for a tanner; and the ramshakle
cabs and broken-down horses we’re given by our masters to earn an
honest living with. Now I'm out of breath, bein’ wheezy.
There now—that’s grievance No. I., tho' you won't think much of
it, I daresay. People talk of masters and servants, and how they
ought to work together like doves in a cage. With us it ain't pos-
sible, I say; for tho' we’re servants we ain't paid wages as your foot-
man is in that swell house of yourn. I know it, for many a set down
have I had at that there door. . We pay the guv'nor so much a day
for the loan of a clarence or a shoful and a pair of horses, and what-
ever we make over and above that we keep. And oh the dreadful
tumble-down things that some of us get from these cruel heartless
men Slave-drivers I calls 'em. My. master's name is “Old
SKINNUM,” which is short for Skin-em-alive-oh –(his yard is out
Kennington way)—and he do skin us, that’s a fact—the Vampire.
It’s like being sent to dig in a field with a broken spade. “I must
'ave my money,” he says, “whether you’ve any to take 'ome or not.
You're a lazy scoundrel, for the Inspector’s passed the trap, and he
ought to know.” What does he care so long as he can get the
Inspectors to pass the, Shandrydans and hoodwink the Cruelty to
Animals Society? And then besides him there's the horsekeepers—
a set of harpies—who won't clean up the rotten harness unless
they’ve yard-money, or take the mud off the crazy carriage without
being paid for it. And the public, when they git in a fourwheeler
as smells like a family vault as hasn't been opened for a century,
and reeks with disease in its greasy cushions, and catches 'em by the
throat and chokes 'em, don't abuse those who’ye passed it just to
make themselyes agreeable like to old SKINNUM, but they take it out
of me by cutting off the extra sixpence as makes all the difference at
the end of the day. And upon my word, I’ve not the sperit some-
times to have it out with 'em. A joll wrangle is good for all
of us, now and then. It keeps the blood flowing and the lungs in
order and the wits straight. But if poor I’m §: Sir, and i. t
like sneers. I object to chippin'. Jeers I a
ominate, though a
fawning fellow-creature I despise. If I’m set to drive a slap-up lot
I’m as pleased as the gen’leman on the outside of }. paper, Sir,
and can give and take and keep the ball a-rolling when I rattle like
greased lightning by a pal in the street; but when Old SKINNUM
owes me one (when I've made a joke for instance about his red nose
and cheeks full of holes like crumpets, and he's overheard me), why
then I hang my head—I do, honour, Sir-and choose all the meanest
and most roundabout street, while the fare’s a cussing inside, lest a
pal should be ungenerous, and chaff. Just at this present time I'm
in bad luck, Sir, for (and it breaks my heart to think of it) I'm
driving as second horse a beast that makes me blush and look t'other
way, which leads to awkward collisions sometimes, and accidents,
and then people say I’m drunk, while, may be I’ve not earned sº
much as would permit me to stand at a public bar with honour. If
t'other chaps are standing drinks, of course I’ll do the same, or else
I shouldn't have no business to be there. For if poor I has manners.
No, Sir-it isn't drink as does it. It is that the sight of that bony
back and them droo ing ears give me the horrors like—a kind of
trimmins—and so I don't always see what’s coming when my eyes
are shut. The father of that horse was a mat, and his mother was
a nosebag, I know; and I get insulted by the gentlefolk when I stop
where two streets cross, and put up a finger with an appealing y
as a man must condescend to do in the dead season or starve—how-
ever haughty he may choose to be, with a flower in his buttonhole
and a straw in his mouth, and his nose in the air, and a nobby white
hat with a narrow black band in June and july—and the people toss
their heads and giggle, while the Bobby roars, “Move on!” with a
snigger of contempt as if to say that me and my shabby lot ought to
be swep' from the face of the earth, And I'm not prepared to say
he’s wrong; but is it my fault, I’d like to know, if my master's spite
turns me out a laughing stock; and if after grinning and holding
up a finger all day, till the water gathers in my eyes to think there's
another brat a coming, I get home wearied out by nightfall, with
a sad heart, and nothing in my pocket to buy bread with for the
Fº kids, and my wife down with her seventh, and my figure;
ead as long as a shoful-whip? Oh! The way I’ve bin treated
by some of my fares, who I looked on as honest,--but that's another
grievance, and I'm trespassing on your valuable space, and so
tell you ail about them blackguards another time. Tº

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
OUR MERRY-GO-ROUNDER AT THE
CHRISTMAS SHOWS.
“THE children are at home for the holidays,” says jolly old
Paterfamilias Punch, “let’s give 'em a round of amusements and
the pick of the Pantomimes.”. So
here goes for all the fun of the Fair,
or as much of it as we can compress
into a limited space. First, of course,
comes Old #:
Here the children's old friend, Mr.
E. i. i*i; sº has illustrated the
story of La Belle au Bois Dormant
§ the playbills have it) in a grand
hristmas Annual. With such a
resent, “The Lane” should be a
ong one “without a turning" from
success. A young lady called Little
Addie is Mother Goose, and is more
than an Addie-quate representative
of that frisky matron. Mr. RIDLEY
is “the Goose”—no end of a Goose
in fact—and that there is not a
Greater Goose in all Pantomime
Land, we can Ridley believe. As to
scenery, the audience has full change
for its money. Nothing could be
better than “Mother Goose's Farm
in Lowther Arcadia,” with its Dance of Dolls by the “Children
of the National Training School.” Good again is the Royal Nur-
sery with “working pictures.” Miss KATE SANTLEY discourses
most excellent music, and dances with the grace of a fairy and the
assistance of a RoBERTs and a JULIEN GIRARD. Splendid scenery,
º acting, and a capital “book.” Mr. ALFRED THoMPson is to
congratulated on the costumes, bright, fanciful, and novel.
Covent Garden–Walentine and Orson.—Magnificent ' The Lane
has The Goose, but the Garden has The TAYLOR, that is, Mr. JAMEs
TAYLOR, who is invaluable as King Pippin. And then there is
THE Goose STEP AND A LITTLE
ONE ADDIE'D.
THE Cove NT “GARDEN PARTY.”
Master LAURI, who represents a Young Bear, and is the very
cleverest of Cubs. , When Orson, is *endowed with reason,” he
insists on this Cub being shaved like a poodle, and then dressed as
a gay young dog about town. “Cupid's. Home in Watteau Land”
is emphatically the most magnificent picture ever presented on a
stage. If Mr. BEVERLEY had not been covered for nearly half a
century with a perfect forest of º: evergreens, this scene
would give him enough laurels to serve him for a couple of hundred
bowers. The Hall of Chivalry, with its hundreds of brilliantly
attired Knights and Ladies, can scarcely be surpassed; and the glade
in “the New Forest,” where Covent Garden is turned into a perfect
Bear-Garden, is the very acmé of scenic deception. Bravo HICKs
Here the Vokes family appear to the greatest advantage. WIC-
TORIA is a gallant Valentine, singing, dancing, and playing as well
as ever. . FAWDON is eccentric as usual, and as for Mr. FRED,
there is no necessity to say that he has fallen upon his legs, and is,
To finish with, ... FRED
therefore, excellently “ º."
PAYNE is a really humorous Clown.
The Surrey-Hop o' my Thumb, or, Harlequin Nobody, Some-
body, Busybody, and the Wicked Ogre with the Seven League Boots,
a title, which in its crispness, reminds one of the old days of the
Prince of Wales's Theatre. (By the bye, the Wicked Ogre with the
Land League Boots wouldn't be a bad name for an Irish Panto-
al
mime.) #. juveniles of the audience will be enchanted with the
chorusses of infantile harvesters, jolly waggoners, blithe and gay
milkmaids, huntsmen, brewers, and poachers. the same scene
is fº. a very pretty and novel ballet of gleaners, clothed in straw,
and poppies, and cornflowers. Good fun is contributed by Mr.
FRANK WooD, and the Brothers WEMs. Miss MAUD BEVERLEY wins
several encores for her songs, and “Miss Queen Mab,” works the
house into an ecstasy of delight by her hornpipes.
The leading idea of the piece is the conflict 'twixt Ogre-at-Arms
and Hop o' My Thumb. To say the former is played by GEORGE
CoNQUEST Jun., and that the
fantomime has been looked after
by the GEORGE CoNQUEST, is suffi-
cient to indicate the excellence
of Ogre. He is eleven feet high,
with a mouth as large as Regent's
Park, and such a wicked, ...i
eye | Hop o' My Thumb is play
by Master CHARLIE AD£SoN, who
while fighting the Ogre, finds time
to woo and win Daisy, played by
Miss EDITH ADásos. The two
combined might be six feet high,
and these little ones are the stars
of the piece. Bright, pretty
children, deserving º round of applause that greets them;
and the only answer to the vociferous encores of “Lah di Dah,”
is their being carried off the stage by Mr. Hollan D, for young
voices are not strong, and encores are simply cruelty.
And the scenes run on merrily until we are in a glade of trees.
The time is winter. The band plays that melody the authorship of
which is vexing dramatic critics. The Ogre enters. He is attired
in evening dress; the onl Qgre on record who has worn such a cos-
tume, and the effect is ludicrous in the extreme. But see, here
comes Mr. IRVING—I mean Master CHARLIE ADíson—likewise in
evening dress. Coats and waistcoats are taken off. Handkerchiefs—
the Ogre's is large enough to serve for a table-cloth to a family of
thirteen—are arranged, and the fight with penny swords commences.
The Ogre breaks his, but no matter, Hop o' My Thumb cracks his
across his knee, and with daggers bound up in the aforesaid hand-
kerchiefs, does the duel go on. The Ogre is slain, and away we go
to the Abode of Chloris and Vacuna, and then the tremendous
cheering and clapping of hands prove that Mr. WiLºw Hoºd
has scored another success at the Surrey.
The Alhambra.--A ballet d'action called Hawaia, a capital dish,
with jº Mr. ALFRED THoMPson. Spirited music by the
experienced M. JACOBI. Scene—somewhere in Spain, exterior of a
church. Ballet-dancers
at §. Enter a sort of
Archbishop with banners
—one blesser and two
banners—who gives the
ballet his benediction in
pantomime, and so illus-
trates the genuine good
feeling existing at this
articular period of
anish history, between
the Church and the Stage.
Enter suddenly Mlle. TH.
DE GILLERT as Somebody

before the *...hº.

from the world. Then a

by a noble savage, and to rescue Mlle. PERTOLDI, he, by the aid ºf a
rope, leaps across a cloud of vapour, which is tºº. ascending
from a steam-laundry somewhere below. Decidedly a success.

COUNSEL FROM CONGRESS.
A well-MEANT Resolution is about to be proposed in Congress by
Mr. KING, Member for Louisiana, that the American Secretary of
State “be instructed to inform her Britannic MAJESTY's Government
that it is highly expedient reforms should beintroduced immediatel
tending to the permanent pacification of Ireland, and be .#
in a kindly, considerate, and pacificatory spirit.” It is earnestly
to be i. that an amendment, obviously requisite, on this resolu-
tion, will be moved by some competent American Statesman. Mr.
GLADSTONE and his colleagues do not want to be informed how ex-
pedient it is for them to introduce in as kindly, considerate, and
still rather in as pacificatory spirit as they can, reforms imme-
diately and effectually tending to the pacification of Ireland; what
they do want to know is, what reforms are likely ever to succeed in
effecting that end., Perhaps, some Member of . Congress, with a
wiser head on his shoulders, than even Mr. KING's, will; in a well-
worded improvement upon that gentleman's motion, let them know.
From the Greek.
IMAGINE the delight of Lord Mayor MAC ARTHUR at receiving the
telegram from Greece, informing him that a “Victorious Pallas”
had just been unearthed, and was considered a genuine work of
PHIDIAs. His Lordship, who would have insisted on paying for the
telegram, had not the expense of the message been already defrayed,
observed that he should have liked to decorate somebody for the
discovery of this work of Art; had it, not, occurred to him, that to
show any preference would be an in Phidias task. (Öh, your
Lordship! Oh!)

LARGE woman soul, sure of unfading bays,
It little boots o'er thy too early tomb
To puff our little breaths of passing praise-
Dead in the deepest of Midwinter's gloom,
Ere thine own Autumn's mellow fruitage failed!
We mourn a Larger Light, eclipsed too soon
By the all-darkening Shadow; we who hailed
Its rise, its rounding to the plenilune
Of finished force and chastened grace, lament
The passing of a Power. Thou perchance
Bearest it all unstained, as still unspent,
To spheres unclogged by earthy circumstance.

MISREPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT.
IN these stormy days it is as well to dip into statistics,
and see how we are represented. The House of Com-
mons numbers 652 Members: 489 of these belong to
England and Wales, 60 to Scotland, and 103 to Ireland.
We are not inclined to advocate an increase of Members,
because we consider the present jawbone power of Parlia-
ment to be more than sufficient for a thousand Samsons
to slay a million Philistines. We are inclined, however,
to alter the distribution of these Members. e whole
electors of the United Kingdom are somewhat over three
millions. Scotland possesses less than 306,000 electors for
its 60 representatives, and Ireland and Wales together
less than 368,000 electors for their 135 representatives.
In this unequal distribution London is very badly treated.
With more than 370,000 electors, it is only allowed 25
Members. Of course, London electors and Metropolitan
Members are far inferior in sense, patriotism, and bril-
liancy to Irish and provincial electors and Members, but
some little respect ought to be paid to quantity in the
distribution of voting. We want more jawbone power
for London,
SCHOOL-BOARD PAPERS.–No. 1.
Good behaviour is the art of behaving good. It comprises deport-
ment, dress, language, and other important details.
Deportment may be natural or acquired. If natural, as in the
case of the late lamented Beau BRUMMEL, and his sacred Majesty
GeoRGE THE FourTH, there is nothing to do but to look on, admire,
and copy. If acquired, it must be according to the canons laid down
by Beau NAsh of Bath, and religiously preserved by several genera-
tions of teachers.
In entering a room you must turn out º: toes, and must not put
your hands in your pockets. If nature has turned your toes in, you
must correct nature, even at the cost of physical suffering. Nature
is a thing to write poetry about, but not to drag into the
drawing-rooms of polite society. As an employment for the
hands, which are difficult to deal with, art has provided snuff-
boxes, canes, and eye-glases for men, and fans, smelling-bottles, and
e e-glasses for ladies." In your salutations you must never forget
that it is unpardonable to shake hands with the two extremes of
society. You kiss the hands of Princes, Dukes, and Prime Ministers,
and you present your hand to be kissed by footmen, crossing-
sweepers, and r relations. You must never sneeze in polite
circles, even at the expense of bursting a blood-vessel; and if you
find a hot potato in your mouth in the same society, you must
swallow it at the risk of your life, rather than break the rules of
behaviour.
In the matter of dress you are spared the trouble of thinking.
Society appoints one or two tailors, and one or two dress-makers
from time to time, and you must go to these people for your outward
clothing. Whatever they make you, you must wear—whatever they
charge you, you must pay. If you feel uncomfortable, or look ugly,
or have reason, to be dissatisfied with their prices, you have the
satisfaction of knowing that nearly all the people you meet are in
are Grammars and Pronouncing Dictionaries, but Society sometimes
creates rules of its own, which are not strictly in accordance with the
received authorities. To side with the authorities is to be a fogey and
a pedant; to side with Society is to be a model of haviour.
t would be extremely vulgar to say “sassenger” for sausage, but
such a pronunciation might become fashionable from a variety of
causes, and then it would be your duty to follow the fashion. em.
hº are introduced to a Duchess, and she asks after your health, it is
ardly polite to say you are “right as a trivet,” or “A 1:" but it is
quite possible for a popular member of the aristocracy to bring such
expressions into use, in which case you Nº. be right in
using these peculiar idioms. A great deal will depend upon the
time and nature of the introduction, the surrounding circumstances,
&c. It is almost impossible to lay down any hard and fast rule
which will be applicable at all seasons.
In the pronunciation of words, some allowance is always made
for provincial accents. In England, the north-country dialects are
much favoured, but the Scotch dialect is the most favoured of all.
It is fortunate for Robert Burns that he was born a Scotch poet, as
it more than doubled his chance of rhyming. When he could not
make a melodious couplet with away, he wrote awa', and when the
word penny would not lend itself easily to his song, he wrote batchee,
and skipped gaily over the difficulty. Scotch, however, should be
used as sparingly as possible in the drawing-room-as sparingly as
the bagpipe is used at public concerts. Of course this remark only
applies to the state of things as they exist at the present moment.
A change in fashion—the transfer of the Court, and all its belong-
ings, to Scotland—might make the Scotch dialect the language of
the time, and the bagpipe the national instrument... Our mouths
and ears would then have to be tuned to different notions of gram-
matical and musical propriety, and our text-books altered to suit the
occasion.

CUP AND BALL AT THE LYCEUM.
THIs is the division of the Lyceum programme, Cup first, and
Ball afterwards in the Second Act of the Corsican Brothers.
Since the failure of the Laureate's poor—very poor-Queen Mary
at the Lyceum, and since the disappearance of that light and airy
trifle. The Falcon, miscalled a play, from the St. James's, the Bard's
dramatic work has slightly improved. He is still reckless of con-
struction—was not the immortal WILLIAM also reckless in this
respect?—and he needs compression. But who is to compress a
Laureate? Not even our IRWINg of the Unknown Tongue could
venture on this.
We were wrong in Quranticipations. The Cup, however suggestive
of the Turf, has nothing whatever racey about it. It is a tragedy in
two Acts and five tableaux, and while, after one hearing, it is im-
ible to do justice to its merits in detail, it is easy to point out
its defects, and pleasant to record our favourable impression of it
as a whole. Subsequent familiarity with the text may or may not
breed contempt; and, to take a single striking instance—the speech
of Synorir about the Lion-hunt—we confess to feeling considerable
disappointment at º these lines, printed in the Daily Tele-
; after having heard them finely declaimed by Mr. IRVING
on the Stage. In fact, this speech and his own extempore address
to the audience before the 8. were the two best delivered
and most distinct utterances we have heard from Mr. IRVING
for some considerable time. The speech about the Lion-hunt is
effective on the Stage, as is a similar passage in Bombastes Furioso-
but on examination it is mere sound, signifying nothing.
Cup, which certainly does not cheer, lacks that one touch of
human nature which has given life to worse plays, and without
which the most tic drama ever written must be doomed to
oblivion. Seldom has a piece been so magnificently and so artisti-
º placed on the Stage as The Cup. The Temple of Artemis
is of itself aloneworth a visit; the movement and the º being
nearly faultless. Seldom, too, has Miss ELLEN TERRY been seen,
throughout the play, to greater advantage than in the character
º-
º -
“A Fair. GAL Asian IN HER HARP Y IIoME.”
of Camma; and seldom has she been heard to less advantage than in
the last Act. She is sweetness and light, and classic grace, and
everything that is lovely, but she is not a tragédienne, and, when
the callis made on her tragic powers, she fails. Camma, the sweet,
loving wife, she is; and Camma, the outraged wife, she is; but
Camma, the avenger of blood, as she should be in the supreme situation
of the Second Act, she is not, and never can be. Yet granting this
natural defect, which is not counterbalanced by her art, her Camma
is a fine performance, and it would be difficult to name anyone—the
divine SARAH included—who could play it altogether better; and
sº no one—the divine S. B. again included—who would be so
powe an attraction. Of course, all the Burne-Jonesians and the
aesthetic pagans will rave about her in her classic drapery as “con-
summate,” and about Mr. IRVING in his leopard-skin and then in
his regal robes, as “utter! too precious!” and so forth. If the
rha es of this school could ruin a piece, the fate of The Cup would
probably be sealed within a month.
Mr. IRVING as Synorir, the ex-Tetrarch—a title which enlightened
scholars, before they had read up the subject, thought had something
to do with Tea-Tray in reference to the Cup—did not at once .
the idea of his being “such a dog” as to have got himself kick
out of all decent Galatian Society, so that no gal, Asian could be
allowed by her parents or #. to speak to him, and who in
consequence of this gaiety of disposition had had his licence withdrawn
by the Roman Governor. On the contrary, his expression was more
|hang-dog than gay dog, and his style of ingratiating himself with
Camma, when left alone with her for five minutes by her husband the
unsuspicious Sinnatus (capitally played by Mr. ), was any-
thing but that of an º fascinating deceiver, or even a
Lothario of ordinarily gentlemanly bearing. The Laureate makes
Synorir say that he “never yet met the woman he couldn't wheedle,”
or words to that effect—the actual word “wheedle” being used—
but anything less like a “wheedler” than Mr. IRVING as the wicked
Sinner-ºr it would be difficult to imagine. Taking this defect of
manner with Miss TERRY's lack of power in the Third Act, and
allowing that for certain phases of the two characters no two actors
could be less fitted, while for others no two actors could be better
fitted, we still have to acknowledge in both parts a remarkable
performance, and we are able to congratulate them on a distinct
success, to which, it is fair to add, the admirable mounting and the
excellent º management very largely contribute.
The plot briefly this:-Symoria sends Camma a High-Art
Cup, which she takes, as an offering, to the Temple of High Art-
emis, and on her return thence she
is waylaid by the gay dog Synoria,
who, resenting her husband's unex-
pected interference, stabs him on
the spot, -a vital spot, -and, a year
after, Synorir, now King of Galatia,
comes to offer his hand and half-a-
crown (so to speak) to the widow of
Sinnatus, very much as Richard the
Third did to the
lovely Lady
Anne. Camma
accepts him, but
being as artful
as she is vindic-
tive, puts poison
into the high-
art loving-cu
out of whic
they are both to
drink at the
celebration of
the nuptial—or
guptial — rites. .
Synorir very soon feels uncomfortable, has an attack of the staggers,
and exclaiming that he recognises the spasm as one he had “had a
tºuch ºf '' in Rome, adds that he will “walk it off”—or words to
that effect put into his mouth at this terrible crisis by that grim
humorist the Laureate who will have his littlejoke. Synorir expires,
º so, about five minutes afterwards—it seems an age--does
'amma. -
“THE CUP! CHAMPAGNE CUP! No! 'TIs REAL PAIN
Cup—
I'LL WALK IT OFF! ” [ºtayyers.
So there is an end of one, two, and three—
TERIss and IRVING and ELLEN TERREE,
And then The Corsican Brothers (not Limited) is played as a
Christmas afterpiece. A cheerful bill. So, for a change, we cross
the road to the Gaiety, and see the last Act of The Forty Thieves.
“CAVE GANEM” AND THE Forty-ses AME THIEves.
We have just time to add that Mr. PINERo's Money-Spinner, at
the St. James's, is a success for the Author and the company. the
characters are all "morally weak or unprincipled, and only the man
who conscientiously does his duty is punished in the end.
Mr. CLAYTON and Mrs. KENDAL represent Mr. and Mrs. Boycott,
so that Mr. HARE may at once advertise it as “Successful Experi-
ment of Boycotting at the St. James's.” Details next week.

...To resume the subject of language. There are many expressions which are perfectl
within the rules of grammar and the usages of good society, but which can hardly be quot
as models of elegance. For example, it is not uncommon for persons of position and education
to ask you if you object to dine off a leg of mutton. Your natural impulse would be to
answer “No, as long as it is not too far off the leg of mutton;” but in this, and in all similar
cases, you must check.your natural impulses, and become decent, common-place, and even
* * is only allowed on the stage in fashionable comedy; in society it leads to the
street-door. -------
In alluding to any article, of food, or in drawing up what is vulgarly called a “bill
of fare,” you must always use the French language. You may not understand it, your guests
may not understand it, and the servants will certainly not understand it, but for aii this it
must be used., You must never call soup anything but ſº. your steak must be christened
a filet, and the vulgar chop must be softened into the more aristocratic côtelette. The
dinner itself is always described as a diner a la Russe. This does not mean that there is one
#. dining who is very chilly, or is
essed in the Russian costume, nor does
it mean that the dishes, or rather fragments
of dishes, are served up cold. . Any person
who thinks that the traditional cold mutton
is the real dinner a la Russe is thoroughly
mistaken. The dinner a la Russe is a dinner
at which, you never see the joints, and are
led to believe that you are dining off Christ-
mas-trees, flowers, glass, and Lowther
Arcade toys. Small pieces of food are
brought to you from behind a screen,
which are called entrées not entries. The
roast meat is called rôt, which is not a
vulgar expression, although it looks very
much like it, and, being pronoun roe
sounds fishy. The fish is always called
{..." another curious expression; while
ans are called flageolets, suggestive of a
blow out on musical instruments, and a cer-
tain red wine has a name which sounds like
French for pomatum. The curiosities, of
the menu, as it is called in place of “bill of
fare,” are so numerous that they are worthy
of a separate lecture.
The abbreviations sanctioned by custom,
which ought properly to come under the
head of slang, can jº neglected.
From the time of the three R's, until ave
recent period, this somewhat mechani
form of humour showed no tendency to
increase, but lately fashion has moved in
this direction, and fashion, as we have said
before, must be respected. The three F’s
are now added to the list; to-morrow we
may have the three G's, and the following
day the three H's. It is curious to notice
how manners change with the times. Our
grandfathers had a favourite toast or
phrase, “Wine, Women, and Walnuts,”
and when they were in a jocular mood, they
altered this to “Wine, Women, and Walnuts.”
This was their simple notion of humour.
If they had been as clever as we are, they
would have alluded to this toast myste-
riously as the three W’s, and in moments
of overwhelming hilarity as the three W’s.
We have much to be thankful for.

ESSENCE OF
PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
THURSDAY, January 6.-I have often heard
people calling in at 85, Fleet Street, say that
the House of Commons is the pleasantest Club
in London. As far as I have gone through it,
I think the praiseisnot overdone. Everything
seems very cosy, and, what is more, the
Members are clubbable men. Everyone has
been as glad to see me, as if I were his own
brother; in some cases (Colonel HARcourt's
for example) more so. Nothing could exceed
e kindness of Mr. GLADstone, unless it were
that of Sir STAFFoºd NonTHcore. They stood
at the bar talking to me for some time before
the SPEAKER called out, “Members desiring
to take their seats, will please come to the
Table.” They pointed out all the historic points
of the place, †. Mace, on which
Dr. Kenza -
- LY hooked umbrella whilst he
took the oath; the particular spot where
Mr. Plmsoll s on one leg, and shook his
fist at the Prime Minister, and the ###
along which the matting is worn out by Mr. BRADLAUGH’s footsteps,
as he walked up to the table demanding to take the oath, and ºf
refusal., Also, they pointed out the celebrities of the place, and
noticed that whilst 4GLADSTONE was particularly anxious to draw
my attention to Lord RANDOLPH CHURCHILL, Mr. CHAPLIN, Mr.
GoRST, and one or two gentlemen on the left of the SPEAKER, Sir
STAFFORD seemed to find more interestin Sir WILFRID LAwson, and
some other Members below the gangway on the Liberal side, who I
believe occasionally prove a thorn in the side of the Government.
“Give you a day's sport with the hares and rabbits,” said Sir
ILLIAM HARCOURT, as he passed us on the way to the Treasury
Bench, on which he hilºsºlar a space.
i. Thank you, Sir W.,” I replied with a wink, “I’ll wait till close

It was not long before I was personally made acquainted with Lord
LPhi RCHILL. He came up to me immediately after I had
shaken the SPEAKER's paw. He said he had observed that the

Leader of the House, and the ſtitular Leader of the Qpposition, had
brought me up to the Table; which was very right, he said, though
rhaps it had been just as well, in this case, if the established rule
#. been stretched a little, and three Members had taken part in the
ceremony of introduction. -
“We are all proud of you, Toby,” he said, “and it would have
been well if effect had been given to this feeling by the real Leader
of the Opposition publicly associating himself with your reception.’
I thought this was very nice: indeed. But I presently discerned
that it was intended to cover a little scheme which this astute youn
man had elaborated. In brief, he wanted me to join the Fo
Party. (J33-4 + -

BALFour is a nice young man, and has
an uncle. But he is so lady-like in his
manners, , and drives, me mad, by
sitting on his shoulder-blades, with his
legs more than half-way across the

who will—”
“RANDoIPH,” I said, “you have
spoken franklytome, more º
. your nearest friends, and I
be equally plain with you. You are a
nice young man, clever and amusing,
erhaps more amusing than clever,
ſou have hit º a new thing, and
deserve to profit by it. Men who kick
over the traces are common enough on
the other side of the House. The new
delight you have given us is the
spectacle of an undisciplined Tory, a
man who will not march at the word of
command, and who snaps his fingers at
his Captain. I cannot join yours or
any other party in the House, for
the sufficient reason already explained
- by Mr. Punch. I am a Party myself.
I am the Fifth Party. But if it were otherwise, and I were looking
about for alliances, I would not join you. You won't last long,
RANDolph. You are rather funny than witty—more impudent
than important. The joke of your setting up to lead the great Con-
servative Party tells by reason of its supreme audacity and by
the comical spectacle of a good man like STAFFORD, Northcote
struggling with the adversity of your existence. That joke will pall
by-and-by. The Conservatives will see that you are doing for them
what is being continually done by ardent young men on the Liberal
side, who are always striving to break up their party. You don't
come within a thousand miles of the ability of Lowº, and are not
nearly as elever as poor. HoRsMAN, and you know what he became.
When your side comes back to power, you will probably be gagged
with an Under-Secretaryship, andwill become even as those roystering
spirits of an earlier age—CAVENDish BENTINck and JAMEs Low THER.”
CHURCHILL went off without saying a word. ... I fancy he was
huffed. I cannot imagine what I said to hurt his feelings.
I do not wish to give a too hasty opinion, but, to tell the truth to
myself, I must admit that I foun e other proceedings of the day
a little dull. Just before two o'clock I was contemplatively pacing
the Octagon Hall, when I heard behind me a tº shout and the
rush of many feet. The space was roped off, and a line of police
kept a growd of people back. Of course as a Member, though not yet
sworn in, I was privileged to walk inside the ropes. I had been told
about something which happens on the Derby Day when a dog inno-
cently strays across the Course, and I confess that when I heard the
shouts and saw the people staring at me, a sickening sensation crossed
my mind.
Eut º I saw the SPEAKER coming along in wig and gown,
and behind him a stout, pleasant-looking gentleman, with shapely
legs, carrying a gold stick on his shoulders. Now I saw what was
the matter. He had stolen the bauble, this pleasant-faced gentleman,
and this .# crowd behind him would presently come up with
him, and assuredly despoil him.
Order, and nip him by the calf? It was well I did not follow my
nat generous instinct. A nice start for a new Member to be
found with his teeth in the left leg of the Sergeant-at-Arms!
No, I was quite wrong. This noisy, ramping crowd was only
the Čommons of º preceded by the SPEAKER and Mace,
crossing the Hall to hear the Royal Speech read by Commission in
the House of Lords. Royalty itself was not there, Royalty very
wisely preferring Osborne and leisure to Westminster and business.
Instead of Royalty there sat on the bench before the Throne five
of the oddest objects I ever saw out of a pantomime. They were
dressed in red cloaks rather the worse for wear. The cloaks were
slashed with ermine, and on their heads they carried each a cocked-
hat. These they were always taking off º putting on, sometimes
severally, occasionally all together. It was a pretty show, and
doubtless has something to do with the British Constitution.
At night we had a good deal of talking—something about Greece,
a flavour of Montenegro, a touch of the Transvaal, and all the rest
Ireland. I was astonished to see GLADstone and STAFFord North-
Core, who had been so pleasant together as we stood chatting at the
Bar, now only the breadth of the Table off tearing each other's hair.
I gathered from Northcote's observations (which were rather long)
that GLADsroxe had done something dreadful everywhere, from
Afghanistan to Athlone; and I was sure from GLADstone's reply
“‘CaughT ox The HIP.”
Should I join the Party of Law and
that NonTHcote would have done the same, or even worse, if he had
had the opportunity.
I was disappointed with the Irish speaking. There was a great
deal of it, but it was dolefully dull. Where through these long
speeches were the humour, the wit, or the eloquence which I have
heard are parts of Irish speech A person named FINNIGAN spoke
for nearly an hour in a style I have not been accustomed to hear,
though it is true I belong to an earlier development of race. A
sullen hatred of England and of all things English burned through
his speech. Yet no one was a penny the worse, or indeed seemed to
pay any attention. The only thin English that Mr. FINNIgAs loves
is the English language, over the shorter syllables of which he
lingers with a touching affection. As he would say, “he ree-grets
to ree-linquish” his hold on its shortest syllables. This has an odd
effect, undesirable because it lengthens his speech.
The speech of the evening was delivered from the Gallery. It
was brief and to the point, and why the Hon. Gentleman should
have been so promptly and ignominiously expelled passes my com-
prehension. Perhaps, like SIR HARDINGE.GIFFARD when last
elected he came up to be sworn in, he had forgotten to bring his
papers with him. - -
n Friday the Lord MAYor and Corporation in their robes en-
livened us with a little bit of colour, and then came the debate on
Irish affairs, when PARNELL was pleasant and ForsTER firm.

The worst bilk I ever got, was once when
I took a Lady and a Gent to Croydon. It
makes me feel all goose-skinny...when I
recall. that humiliating day! It was a
youngish gent, with cheeks like apples, and
a middle-aged lady. I was driving a shoful
then, and peeping down the trap, I saw her
cuddling of him dreadful, and patting his
hands, while he sighed and looked peevish,
being green about the gills, and up-all-
nightish. When we got to Croydon, he
woke up a bit, and seemed more cheerful,
and ordered a private room, and a nice
little dinner, and then came into the stable
to have a chat with me. He was an un:
common pleasant gent, with a sweet voice,
and white hands, and a manner as if to º
“Tho' I'm your betters, yet you’re a fe
low-man, and I won't treat my species like
irt.” we got on first-rate, and he asked
mewhat I thought of the Lady, and when I
said she was a crummy bit of i. he
laughed in a quiet way, and grew less green
about the gills, and invited me to dine with
'em. ... I tried to excuse myself, for I know
my place. Gents have oftentimes asked me
in to pick a bit, social-like, but I don't feel
at home with ladies, somehow. But, how-
ever, he would have it so, and to make a long
story short, we had a nice dinner and some
cham; and dessert, pineapples and expen-
sive things, all topping—and grew quite
jolly. And the Lady said that the Gent
was a going to marry her as soon as he could
settle up some business as bothered him, and
he looked grave and green again at that,
but didn't deny it, and I wished 'em joy,
and then he passed the bottle. And then we
had a smoke (shilling cigars) and a stroll,
and came in again for tea, and while the
Lady was making the tea, the Gent went
away for a minute. I didn't think much of
that at first, but the tea grew cold and the
dy nervous, and then I went out to look
for him. Imagine my surprise and horror!
Here was a kettle of fish 1 He’d bin and
borrowed a saddle, so the horsekeeper said,
and, leaving a note, had gone off on my
prad. I took the note up to the Lady,
and she, fainted right, away. ... What a
sequndrel!. In the note he said that he was
obliged to fly the country, and had chosen
to take the train at a distance from town,
because the London stations were all watched.
And so he'd borrowed my horse to ride upon

had left me the Lady instead, as he didn't
think, on consideration, he was worthy of
such a blessing, and he'd noticed as I
admired her.

THE GREAT BEASTERN RAIL-
WAY AND EPPING FOREST.
HEAVEN made the country, and
the Arch-itect enemy of man's
happiness planted it with “Semi-
detached Willas.” That no “spe-
culative builder” has been hanged
at the entrance of one of his
hideous settlements, says much
for the forbearance of the multi-
tude. Wherever there is a spot
of beauty within reach of London,
the covetous hand of the demon
is stretched out to grasp it. To-
day High Beech is threatened;
to-morrow it will be Burnham
Beeches, and the next day the
small remaining portion of Hamp-
stead Heath.
The Corporation of London,
once the opponent of forest an-
nexation, is now the ally of the
Great Beastern Railway, which
wants to make High Beach “more
accessible.” Who are the land-
jobbers at the bottom of this
scheme, or the squatters in “eli-
gible mansions,” who wish to have
a railway running into their bed-
rooms? Mr. Bedford, who de-
serves so well of the people for
his work in Fººf Forest, must
look to this also. People who are
afraid to walk or drive two miles
in all weathers, should live in
Harley Street, Gower Street, Wic-
toria Street, or some other London
nal settlement, they are not
t for foresters.

ing that “a green Yule makes a

rather that a mild Christmas

this way?... “A stitch in time

observance of this rule would
robably make him so wise that

everything have.” “What is

liking, as the young man said
when he kissed his partner under

out fire” must be read “No fire

enment will require to be made on

a programme into your face, and demands sixpence. Another
requests you to hand over to her your hat, coat, stick, goodness
knows what, and as the stalls at th: Bandbox would scarcely be
considered roomy by General MITE or Mademoiselle ZARATE, you
robably in your ignorance consent to be relieved of these encum-
rances—and of more sixpences

ou decide on treating yourself and Mrs. P., with young Hopeful,
}. for the holidays, and pretty Miss P., still radiant from the
triumphs of her first ball, to a visit to the Bandbox, or any one of
the theatres for which the Bandbox may stand for a specially un-
comfortable sample. First come the Stalls, four at half-a-guinea
a-piece, two guineas; programmes, though on pleasure bent, I know
you are of a frugal mind, and will content yourself with two, one
shilling; attendance of the Houris on the party, say half-a-crown,
and you may think yourself lucky if you get off for that ; there
are refreshments (if you are careless of the morrow), not forgetting
the waiter who never has change; and then there is the man who
calls a cab, for Miss P.'s pretty shoes, were not meant for the
muddy streets, and Master P. is careful of his boot-warnish. A very
small exercise of that financial skill, for which you are so justly
remarkable, will give you, my dear P., a pretty good guess at the
cost of your night's pleasure.
In this matter I say the remedy is in our own hands by flatly refus-
ing so much as a single farthing for any civility on the part of the
attendants. They are worthy of their hire, no doubt, like all other
labourers, but that is a matter between them and their employer, and
in such a theatre as the Bandbox—whose auditorium might be called
a purgatorium—we already pay him more than enough to enable him
to settle that little matter by himself. Whether *...; may flatly

at your own expense. But should the law prove to be against

remains one unfailing remedy, and #. is to carefully shun all those
theatres where these iniquitous extortions are still practised. You
will yery likely have to pay no more for entrance into those houses
which have given them up you will certainly find greater comfort,
greater civility, and, in most instances, far better entertainment.

successFUL “BOYCOTTING” AT THE
ST. JAMES’.S.
AUTHors and Actors are to be congratulated on the success of
The Money Spinner, an interesting two-act play by Mr. A
PINERo.
Mr. KENDAL has rarely been better suited than with Lord Ken-
gussie, Mr. HARE revels in the Baron Croodle,
and never since All for Her has Mr. CLAYTON
given us such an artistic performance as his
Harold Boycott—a most unfortunate and risky
name just now. Had the piece been weak and
the acting indifferent, one voice from the
º where the old gods are not yet
ead, shouting out “‘Boycott’ him 1" would
have been fatal to the chances of a first night.
Luckily no malicious deity was present, and
even had he been there, the strength of the
#. and the excellence of the acting would
ve been too much for him.
As Jules Faubert, Mr. MACRINTosh took us
by surprise. The character is erhaps a trifle
overcharged, but it must be !. in mind
that he is placed in three distinctly strong
melodramatic situations, and above all, it must
be remembered that Jules Faubert is a Detec-
tive, and therefore, bound by all stage rules to
be Fº: “dissembling,” and so to be always exciting suspicion
and attracting attention. Taking this conventional view of the Detec-
tive into consideration, and remembering also that it is a French
Detective who is being represented to an English audience, great
allowances must be made for exaggerated action, where so much-
unhappily for truthful art—would be expected. Those who are
fa r with M. Lecocq, the real French
fetective at the head of his profession, as
drawn by GABonſau, will at once recognise
what a subtle performance Mr. MACRIN-
Tosh might have given us—for he has the
power—had he and the Author only dared
to brave the conventional theatrical tradi-
tion. . As it might have been, it would
have been perfect; and taking it for what
it is, and judging it by the usual standard,
it is as good as it possibly can be.
Mrs. KENDAL's º Boycott is
faultless: even her little mannerisms are
part and parcel of the character. She is
the lady mentioned by the poet, who-
“Makes sunshine in a shady place.”

who has been all her life in Paris. Mrs.
Gaston Murray is a good international concierge; and the very
small part of the French porter, by a real live Frenchman, M. DE
WERNEY, is intensely appreciated by everyone among the audience
who has been for at least two days to Boulong, and still more so by
those who haven't.
and now comes the wonder—namely, that an author should have
chosen such materials for a
play, have managed them
so skilfully, and have had
the luck to get it so per-
fectly played as to cause
its objectionable character
and its wrong moral to be
lost sight of in the realin-
terest awakened by the

ma.
The story briefly is this:
—Harold Boycott, torescue
his father, of whom no one
knows anything, from some
ecuniary difficulties, robs
#. employers. A Detective
is set to watch him, dis-
covers the felony, and
Harold will be a lost man when his master returns next morning.
Mrs. Bºyº. remembering how she used to be called “the Money-
|Spinner” at her father's gaming-table, determines to win the money

from Lord Kengussie, her former lover now engaged to her sister,
at €cartº, and unable to do it by fair means, she cheats, and is dis-
covered by the Detective. This leads to an all-round explanation.
Kengussie, for her sake, makes up her husband's defalcations; the
Detective gets a “slap side o' the head” from Boycott for insinuat-
W. ing that his wife cheats, never receives an apology for the violence
when his charge is proved, loses his case, and is virtually kicked out
of the house.
Let us take the moralworth of these characters: Lord Kengussie,
or Kengoosie-not such a fool as he looks—while still evident! º
in love with his old love, now. Mrs. Boycott, engages i. i* to her
sister, and naively asks, “Is it very wrong to marry a person because
she resembles some one else, with whom I have been, and shall
always be in love?” These are not the exact words, but they convey
the true idea of the motive., Harold Bºycott we may dismiss at once
as an unprincipled man, who, at the first temptation, robs the till.
Qf course, the basis is weak, but the Author cares very little for
that, as long as he secures his strong situation. Baron Croodle is
simply a thorough old swindler, who is colour-blind to morality, with
his eye on the main chance and his mouth to the brandy-flask.
Millicent has all the makings of a genuine Becky Sharp, and after
§§ found out in her first attempt, it is impossible not to mistrust
her altogether. When Lord Kengoosie, on leaving, gives her that

kiss by Boycott's permission, she takes it’so demurely, and has
previously evinced such evident admiration for this young spooney,
that no wonder her sister feels a ºf of jealousy, and Boycott º:
uncomfortable. Were there a sequel to this play, we should see the
vulgar Dorinda—who is delighted to catch a Lord, even though she
knows that he only takes her because he can't get her sister—an utterly
unfit wife for Kengoosie, whose home would be miserable, whose
relations would have cut him, and who would Pº go off with
Mrs. Boycott, while Harold, sunk deeper and deeper in the mire
would play the rôle of Rawdon Crawley when he surprised my Lor
Steyne with Mrs. É
All these are miserable creatures, unhappily true to nature, as
were THAcKERAY's characters who were never quite bad all at once.
The only upright honourable man is the French Detective who, faith-
ful to his employers, conscientiously discharges his most unpleasant
duty and suffers for it... But apart
from the admirable acting, which
might have carried an inferior work,
the faithful portraiture of the wife's
weakness under strong temptation
enlists our sympathies and makes the
success.
As to the construction, easily as the
action moves after the first mauvais

awkward, the explanations so forced,

Tuesday Night, Jan. 11.-Strolled back to the House
after dinner, and found Mr. CHAPLIN on his º I
suppose I am not naturally tender-hearted; but I was
deeply touched at the evident signs of woe with which
the Hon. Gentleman had surrounded himself. He had,
as it were, sat down by crownless and weeping Erin
and only constant calls upon his manhood prºvented
him mingling his tears with hers. Mr. CHAPLIN's voice
and figure admirably lend themselves to an aspect of
woe, and he was all crape to-night; For my own #.
iſ felt as if we, the Commons of England, were assem led
at the graveside over which had already been lowered
the British Constitution, and that this was the Chaplin delivering
the funeral oration. -
Perhaps his remarks lost something of their force from the fact
that they were not all audible. This was due to occasional bursts of
emotion which swept across the tall, figure attired in sombre black
and sunk, its voice to a whisper, like the wailing of wind roun
many tombstones. Some Hon. Gentlemen on the Ministerial benches
affected to laugh; but it was a very hysterical kind of mirth. Mr.
Newpºgºre produced a very large red pocket-handkerchief, and
unaffectedly dried his eyes. rd RANDOLPH CHURCHILL nervously
toyed with his moustache. Mr. WARTON took prodigious pinches of
snuff in a vain attempt to hide his emotion; and Mr. BIGGAR wi
away the unbidden teer with the back of his cuff. As for me, after
withstanding the impulse as long as possible, I threw back my head,
and gave vent to my feelings in a Folonged and melancholy howl,
such as you may occasionally have heard in the dead .# night,
when the rain is on the roof, and there is a newly-chained dog in
your neighbour's back-yard. The Sergeant-at-Arms came over to
me, and, gently leading me out, explained that that sort of thing is
unparliamentary.

It seems we can make all sorts of noises save this particular one.
We may laugh contemptuously or *::::::: we may call out
“Oh oh!” like Mr. WARTON.; we may gruntli ethelate lamented
Admiral; we may pipe a shrill “Hear! hear !” like Mr. BIGGAR,
or emit a highly-pitched and sonorous “Yah! yah!” like Mr. Monk;
or we may even go out behind the SPEAKER's Chair, and crow thrice,
like Her Majesty's former Judge Advocate-General. But the line
must be drawn somewhere, as Captain GossET says; and it is fixed
at rather an awkward place for me.
Mr. CHAPLIN's touching oration was on the Amendment to the
Address, which we have been debating four nights now, and appear
to be a little further off the end than when we began. It seems to
me the debates on Irish subjects are like the claret at the farmers'
dinners. You take a great deal, but you “get no forrader.”
11 P.M.–There is enormous excitement in the House. Everyone
is running after everyone else to, tell him. One hears the news
echoing in the Hall and rumbling through the corridors.
Mr. JAcob BRIGHT has made a jokel - -- -
Everyone says that the Hon. Member didn't know]it, hadn't

new planet when it is discovered. It didn't mean it, didn't know it,
and couldn't help it. But there it is, and astronomers watching on
distant heights flash to each other the glad intelligence.
JACOB was slowly and painfully mounting his Ladder of proof that
coercion was a very bad thing, when
he had to make incidental reference
to Lord RANDoLPH CHURCHILL, who,
as everyone knows, sits for Wood'
stock. Mr. JAcob BRIGHT in the
exaltation of the moment º over
a syllable, and alluded to the young
statesman as “the Noble i. the
Member for Woodcock.” It was not
precisely a flash of wit. But there
was something irresistibly comical in
its concurrence. The last man in the
House from whom a joke is expected
is the Member for Manchester. One
of three men whom the House most
dearly loves to poke fun at is Lord
RANDolph CHURCHILL. The conjunc-
tion coming on a dull night, one of a
series, was received with hilarious gratitude, and the sorrow of a
nation is temporarily eclipsed by the lingering delight with which
men dwell on what will probably hold a place in history to the
remotest time as—“JAcob BRIGHT's joke.”
Wednesday.—The air is full of electricity to-day. The political
§º is run up, and presently we shall have gales from
N.N.E., backing to E., accompanied by snow and sleet. The busi-
ness is beginning perhaps a little early. I am told that when
Mr. GLADston E came into power in 1868, it was quite two years
before Gentlemen below the gangway began actively to work in the
direction of bringing back the Tories. Now scarcely a year has
passed, and the work is already merrily going on. There are private
meetings upstairs and downstairs, and in the young ladies' chamber
where tea is dispensed. The gentleman whom everyone here calls
“PETER,” but who is known at Burnley
as Mr. RYLANDs, has been walking about
with long strides, looking unutterable
things.
“PETER is the stormy, petrel of
politics,” Mr. BRIGHT said, just, now.
“Whenever I see him walking .
about the House, with long strides an
right arm swinging at his side, I know
there is something up, and we on the
front bench had better look out.”
As far as I can make things out, it's
all about F. At first I thought the
initial letter was intended to represent
Fudge. . But it is worse than that. It
seems they want three F.'s. . I
don’t know, and have not yet been lon
enough in Parliament to have acquir
the habit of talking on matters of
which I am absolutely ignorant. What
I am certain of is, that, up to now,
people seem to have got along pretty
º with one F. Even in China, where
labour is cheap, and where they have two thousand letters in the
alphabet, they have only one F. But now PETER and the rest will
have three F.'s—or Blood shall Flow.
The worry is very plainly telling on Mr. GLADSTONE. He is a
eat man, and can do almost, everything but take matters quietly.
#. sits all night in his place, listening anxiously, and won't go home
and be put to bed by twelve o'clock as he jºi. He passed me in
the Corridor just now, looking five years older since the Session opened:
“Toby,” he said, wearily, “what would you do if your tail tried
to wag you?” -
“Sir” I replied, “I would sit on it.”
“That’s not a bad idea,” the PREMIER said, walking off with fresh
vigour in his stride.
Thursday Night.—I like Sir PATRICK O’BRIEN’s Speech, as far as
I can understand it. Perhaps some objection might be taken to his
oratorical attitude. I don't suppose DEMosTHENES was accustomed
to address his countrymen with both hands in his trousers' pockets, if
indeed, he wore any º that precisely answered to the modern
pantaloon. Nor was Mr. GLAPSTONE ever known to restrain the force
of his gestures by the limits of his pockets. Mr. BRIGHT, sometimes,
in the easier passages of his oratory, will have one hand so disposed,
and Lord BEAconsºl ELD, when working out, a perfectly impromptu
joke, has, I am told, been known to have both his hands behind him,
elegantly disposed in his coat-tail pockets. These examples, how-
ever, do not go all the way to excuse Sir PATRICK's preference for
his pocket, or render classic his favourite attitude.

the reward, . A veteran, who remembers WELLINGTON, overcome, is
But the Speech is the thing, and the Speech was magnificent. It
was like a picture of TURNER, all haze and fragments of objects
animate and inanimate. Regarded in detail, and with embarrassing
intention to look up the sense of things; it was perhaps open to
criticism. You begin here and finished there, or round the corner.
or in the next parish, or in the furthest planet. But as no one
would take a foot-rule and an Ordnance map to check off one of
TURNER's pictures, so none but a pedant would too curiously inquire
what Sir PATRICK might mean by this emphatic and luminous speech
delivered at midnight. It was a poem rather than a speech—such a
Fº as we might expect from Mr. Robert BRowNING if he set up
is pulpit in Parliament. Sir PATRICK himself saw it all clearly.
His whole figure trembled with indignation, as he denounced somebody
or something. His face flushed with honest indignation as he regarded
the depths of infamy into which something or somebody had fallen;
and each listener examined his own heart to discover whether it
was possibly he at whom the Hon. and eloquent Baronet, with stern
visage and corrugated brow, pointed the finger of pitiless scorn.
Mr. NEWIEGATE (who, I am glad to sce, has got over the effects
of his little nap in the House the other night) tells me a pretty story
about Lord ALTHORPE, whom he remembers, as he knows a man
whose great great grandfather's father-in-law was in Cromwell's
Parliament. It seems, that one day Lord ALTHORPE, being Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer, had occasion to make a certain statement,
which he had intended to bear out by some figures he had tabulated.
Coming down to the House in a hurry, he hi". his papers,
and mentioning this circumstance to the House, added, that they
must take his word for it that if he had his notes with him they
would demonstrate his case. The House believed in Lord ALTHORPE,
as it believes in Lord HARTINGTON, and at once accepted his statement.
Thus it is with Sir PATRICK O’BRIEN. Sense and consecu-
tive º has omitted to bring with him. But the House
listening to his rounded periods, noting his earnest manner, and
vaguely sharing his moral indignation, takes these for granted, and
y believes all he is understood to have meant to say.
Saturday, 1.30,—It is over at last! The division has been taken,
and by 435 votes to 57; the House of Commons has declared its
preference for the Queen's Government, as against the Government
of the Land League. . It has been a fearsome week, and though no
one that I can hear of has ; the three F.'s, we have all felt the in-
fluence of the three D.'s. Doleful, Drear full. Poor Mr. FoESTER
has scarcely had heart or time to brush #. hair, and has sat on the
Treasury Bench night after night, in a condition of accumulated
depression. As the three blind mice ran after the farmer's wife, to
remonstrate with her on the º of the carving knife, so
these mysterious and omnipotent three F.'s have chased Mr. FoESTER
through the dull hours of the week.
The joy of deliverance is shaded by the knowledge, that on Mºnday
as early as possible, we shall begin it all over in. Scarcely hid
the roar o º rting Members in search of cabs died out of the
House, when Mr. JustiN McCARTHY was on his feet, moving the
adjournment of the debate with deadly intent to renew it on Monday.
Everything runs in threes just now, and naturally there are three
Amendments to the Address; also we should have three editions ºf
this debate, which seems to answer the question, whether life is worth
living. For my own part, reviewing the long hours of the week, and
venturing to slightly alter the eloquent, phrase of Mr. GRAY, which
so delighted the House just now, I ...i. say that three-quarters of
it was certainly not, whilst one half is only partially so.

THE mightiest campaign that United Europe had witnessed for six
centuries was over at last. The struggle was ended.

Then there is a terrible Thush of respect, as the one living repre-

“FORTITER OCCUPA PORTUM.”
IT appears there has been a Sanitary Inspection of
the Port of London. The information comes from the I
Shipping Gazette, so it is apparent what port is meant;
but why should there not be a sanitary inspection of port
wine. What a fine field of labour would lie before the l
Sanitary Committee which undertook such a task. The
revelations which it would make, would, no doubt, be ||
painful, but the information gained could not fail to be
of value. It would discover, perhaps, that such un-
considered trifles as sugar, logwood, elderberries, litmus
beet-root and rhatany, entered into the composition of
ort wine, varied with carbonates of potash, soda and
ead. The flavour so much ap jiàº'à be found
to be due to tannin, and the bouquet to, laurel water,
while the wine would give conclusive evidence of forti-
fication with raw spirit of the lowest class, ordered by the
British wine merchant, who, as a high authority states
is chiefly to blame for “all the corrupt practices pursued
in the sophistication of wine.”
The appy Committee would also discover that many
absolutely spurious ports were in the market, which are
made with a beautiful crust, while a venerable appear-
ance is cleverly imparted to new corks. Somebody must
drink such counterfeits, or they would not be made, and
therefore somebody suffers. "It is probable also that the
Committee would suffer, and the family doctor would be
in request after every tour of inspection. But still we
might hope to find a gradual improvement, in what
Christopher North called a “sound constitutional
episcopal” wine; and even SIR WILFRID would hardly

LILLIPUT TO THE RESCUE |
THERE was a little man
- Had a little Party clan,
Of which he was regarded as the head, head, head;
Neither Tory quite nor ig,
Nor numerically big,
Oh, how bravely, how consummately ’twas led, led, led !
This little man was young,
But he had a little tongue,
Which glibly and audaciously he'd wag, wag, wag.
And his followers—there were three ſ—
Cheered his talk with noisy glee,
And the Universe defied their mouths to gag, gag, gag.
And the Universe looked on,
Rather tickled at the fun;
Puck-Demiurgus really wasn't in it, in it, in it.
Like four Minnows amidst Tritons
Dwelt that quaint quartette of Crichtons,
And the Tritons were not troubled for a minute, minute, minute.
Then a crisis there arose,
And, as one might well suppose,
The little man that crisis rose to meet, meet, meet;
Gave his locks a defter curl,
- His moustache a tighter twirl,
And pitched his vocal pipes to accents sweet, sweet, sweet.
With one hand upon his hip,
And the other with a grip
On his little—very little—sword of lath, lath, lath,
He thrasonically cried, .
“Titans, I am on your side;
So you needn't fear the lions in your path, path, path.
“Though you look so tall and strong,
You're good giants quite gone wrong,
And you really, really are not a success, cess, cess.
From your simmering and surging,
I'm afraid that fear is urging
You to measures that will land you in a mess, mess, mess.
“But there, don't you be afraid "
I am coming to your aid, -
If you’ll only up and do the thing that's right, right, right.
Just you range yourselves behind me,
And come on! By George, you'll find me
A much more than modern Malbrook in the fight, fight, fight.
“On! There’s nothing I won’t darel
Can you hear my voice up there *

}.} be frightened ' Trust to me .
Why, I’ll call up my brave Three,
And we four º fight for you—aye, like one man, man, man’”
Then those Titans twain looked down—
They were giants of renown–
At that perky, pigmy Paladin below, low, low,
done of them gave a puff
Of derision. 'Twas enough.
Lo! the Lilliputian vanished with the blow, blow, blow !
DIFFICULTIEs of SPEECH.--To give a flat contradiction in round

quotation, “The
SCHOOL-BOARD PAPERS.—No. 3.
THE object of all education, as you are doubtless aware, is to
soften your manners and suffer you not to be brutal. The kind,
good, and patient ratepayer, who finds, the money to refine you, is
under the impression that he or his children will reap the benefit of
this refinement in a decrease of criminality, or rather illegality, and
its consequent expenses. Let him not live and die under a false
impression. Soften your manners to the consistency of pap. Never
let your angry passions rise beyond the level of genteel indignation;
never let your more or less little boots, and the more or less little
feet that are in them, be found i. on a sister or a mother.
Check unruly speech. Your little tongues were never formed to
make disrespectful observations about each other's eyes.
I say check unruly speech. I may go further, and say never use
| language that is not largely diluted with water. Never say, you
i. a thing, when you have such a harmless word as dislike.
Never call people vicious when you can describe them as #.
Never accuse a man of impudence when you can say he has a little
too much confidence; never say he is hº you have
such a word as venturesome. Remember that nothing is atrocious,
it is only notorious; that no one is callous, he is only unsusceptible.
Remember that no one cheats, he only beguiles; that no one is
criminal, he is only illegal; that no one commits a blunder, he is
only guilty of an error of judgment. Things that coarse people
would call trash, you must speak of as trifles; things that coarser
F. le would call filthy, you must speak of as dingy; things that
would call gaudy, you must speak of as glittering. Never
forget that people are not fools or foolish, they are simply simple;
that they are not .#;"| but pleasantly adipose; that no one
gorges, but only fills himself; that murder is softened into despatch;
that lies must always be called fibs, and the men who creates lies
must be called a fibber.
This is only general politeness, which you will show to all sexes

B. They each receive a £5 note and two half-crowns. It used to
be the custom to #. the half-crowns into the Poor Box, but, some
time ago, one of them moved that £50 should be put in at Christmas,
out of the Company's Funds, instead of the half-crowns, so now they
wrap them up in their £5 notes, and quietly pocket the iot.
O. C. From what I gather from the Master and from you, the
Company seems to have an enormous income.
B. Fortune has smiled upon the Worshipful Bellows-Menders.
O. C. So it seems. Can you give me any special case?
B. Yes, Sir, I can. The one Member of our Company whose
name wereverence above that of all other men, is SIM on SLodge,
who, as I have often heard our Reverend Chaplain say, “in the true
spirit of a patriotic Bellows-Mender,” left us £20,000 “to enjoy
ourselves,” and, as our Worshipful Master would say, we devote
every §§ of it in accordance with the will of the pious Donor.
O. C. No doubt of it.
B. We hold a Grand Festival on St. Simon's Day every year, and
drink in solemn silence to his pious memory. On one occasion,
remember, when we had a rather unlearned Master, he made a
curious mistake, and actually proposed the health of St. Simon'

36 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. [JANUARY 22, 1881.
TAKE CARE OF YOUR COMMONS.
Most ExCELLENT MR. PUNCH,
You, have always found Toby, a good house-
dog, and will doubtless find him a good House-of-Com-
mons #. What is very much wanted in that House, is
a suitable dog to do the work of a watch-dog.
The purpose, for which a watch-dog is requisite in
Parliament, and especially the Lower House, is that of
keeping a look out on Private Bills, which very often get
smuggled through it to the privation of the Public.
Amongst those Bills, some of the most objectionable
and injurious Bills are Railway Bills, through which
Public Land is expropriated by Private Associations.
Attention is due to an alarming statement, which you
may have seen, that divers Railway Companies design to
obtain Acts enabling them to annex, or encroach upon,
sundry Commons in the neighbourhood of London.
In particular, Wimbledon Common is named as one of
the Commons threatened by Railway Companies with
spoliation. A sharp, thorough, wide-awake parliamen-
tary watch-dog is needful to protect that most beautiful
of the Commons and most valuable of the open spaces
about the Metropolis from devastation.
It is to be hoped that Toby will not have too much else
to do than keep his eye as a watch-dog on Private Bills.
His two eyes are as good as a hundred, and there is no
other dog equally endowed with optical organs, up to
snuff, and vigilant, except indeed your Ancient Canine
Friend, ARGUs.
P.S. Guard well against every attack, on the Lungs of

able sunshine, we might call them, London Lights.

SIR,--I am a business man. England is a business nation. Let

for the sake of convenience let Time, not Words, be the commodity
charged. Here is my scale:-

Any speech after 12 P.M., per minute . . . 1 0 0
From this rule, Sir, I should except all past and present Cabinet
Ministers. You may say that none but the wealthy will be able to
address the House. Precisely so; the man who is clever enough to
make money for himself, or having money is clever enough to keep
it, is sufficiently intelligent to help govern England, and is the man
for my money.

ExTRACted From
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
TUESDAY, January 18, 1 A.M.–It seems that the practice of
doubling parts, highly W. in the theatre elsewhere, has ex-
tended to the stage at Westminster. Mr. PARNELL cannot oblige
the House with an imitation or a reproduction of his oratorical
manner of speech when addressing Gentlemen in Ireland, whose
souls he has already exalted to the lofty height of determination not
to pay their rent. But so flowing is the wealth of his genius, that he
can on two nights afford Hon. Members two opportunities of fresh
study. Last night . on Mr. McCARTHY's Amendment to the
Address, he treated the House, not for the first time, to an exhibition
of almost touching humility. He threw himself (in a .
sense of course) upon his knees before Hon. Gentlemen, and plead
admisericordiamfor an audience. “Strike, but hear me for a down-
trodden but law-abiding people,” was the burden of his prayer. To
hear him you would have thought that butter would not melt in his
mouth—though why that should be made a test of meekness of dis-
position I never could quite make out.
It is pretty to see on these occasions how the House rubs its head
stares about, and pinches itself to see if it is awake or the victim of
F. Is this the man who has set Ireland in revolt, and
stum a foreign country for the sinews of war? Is this the
man who has poured into the ear of the Irish peasant a stream of
bitterest denunciation of all things English P Is this the man who
from his place in the House has uttered the foulest calumnies against
statesmen like Mr. GIAPSTONE and Mr. BRIGHT, who have given up
a great portion of their life to the help of Ireland? I don't know".
* i. to hisº . %. his apologetic manner,
and lendling an ear is appeal to the generosity and sense of iustice
of the House, I should say not. g y J
I liked Mr. PARNELL's later manner better, as seeming, if one may
say so, a trifle more honest. It was at one o'clock this morning. The
House was full and eager for the division, lapsing at last from the
miraculousJ.". with which it had listened all night to infinite
droning. . GLADSTONE, like a sensible man, had gone home at
eight o'clock, and was now, where.we all ought to have been, safe in
his kennel. But, before departing, the PREMIER had delivered his
soul in some few burning sentences that had grievously scorched the
Irish Members. Lord HARTINGTON was pretty good last week; but
Mr. GLADSToxE, by grace of #. oratory, was better last night.

PARNELL had learned not less from the glowing periods of the
PREMIER than from the cheers of the House that their game was very
nearly up. They were dull and dispirited, and so far forgot them.
selves as to make short speeches.
It was in this mood of depression that "Mr. PARNELL had made his
earlier speech, and to it had succeeded a feeling of desperation. When
just before one o'clock, Mr. LALOR moved the adjournment, the yell
of execration with which the proposal was received by the House,

[JANUARY 29, 1881.
was followed by a few words from Lord HARTINGTON, the more
telling by reason of the absence of passion with which they were
spoken. Then Mr. PARNELL. rose, and the House, beheld a strange
transformation. His tall, slim #. was literally trembling with
assion, his hands were clenched, his teeth were set, and it was with
#. he could frame his words. Once it seemed as if he were
about to throw off the restraint, so long maintained, by which he
has been able to stop just when on the verge of traversing the
utmost limits of the elastic rules of order.
“You are going to strike down the liberties of the Irish people!”
he hissed through his teeth, turning fiercely upon the SPEAKER,
while his hands convulsively moved in a way that suggested anxiety
to soothe themselves in the folds of the Right Hon. Gentleman's
Wig.
#he SPEAKER has a manner providentially designed to give excited
orators time for reflection. #: with slow movement from his
seat, and standing erect with hands clasped before him, he solemnly
warned Mr. PARNELL that he was disregarding the authority of the
Chair. Perhaps this, took not more than sixty seconds in the
ge, but it was time enough for Mr. PARNELL to master his
enzy before it had proved fatal; and when he rose again he had
once more put on the deferential manner and assumed the smooth
speech which are the indispensable adjuncts of successful obstruc-
tion.
Business done—None.
Tuesday Night.—Mr. WARtoN, is so gratified with the success of
his recent appearance as a poet, that he has some notion of devoting
himself to the business. is Muse has indulged in a fresh flight
suggested by the condition of affairs in the House of Commons, and
I am gratified at the opportunity of lightening the pages of my ñiary
with it:
“The Harp that once through Stephen's Halls
The soul of humour shed,
Now hangs as mute upon its walls
As if that soul were dead.”
Mr. WARTox explains, what is hardly necessary, that he means
the Irish Members of the present day are sorely degenerated, as
compared with their predecessors; and I think the poet is right.
e have had another night of Irish oratory, and it has proved
heavier than the snow-storm, and, in point of
obstruction, equally successful. There is
something about the articulate Irishman,
which altogether prevents him from being
dull. But the just complaint is that the pro-
portion of grains of eorn to bushels of chaff,
is so ridiculously small. There was Mr. MARUM
just now who suddenly flashed forth a per-
fectly charming notion. He was denouncing
to the score of Members present the calumni-
ous habits of newspaper writers and others
who, it seems, have º disparagingly of
the loyalty of the Land League. Mr. MARUM
had a triumphant proof in refutation. Once
he was at a Land League dinner, and amongst
the toasts proposed, when the whiskey was
brought in was, “The Queen and the rest of
the Royal Family.” What more was needed
to prove the, loyalty of the League * Onl
one thing; that Mr. MARUM should respon
on be of the Queen and the other mem-
bers of the Royal family, and this he did.
Mr. MARUM is a Gentleman with a red face
and a loud voice, who reminds me of a com-
mercial traveller I have met somewhere. He
related this little story without the slightest
suspicion that there was anything comical in
the notion of his responding for this particular
* ; which º: the nº". º

Mr. O'DoNNELL’s fervid fancy has accidentally hit upon a new
standing order for dealing with obstruction, that seems to go to the
root of the whole matter.
It is the Axe in the Lobby! -
“If,” said the Hon. Member, just now dropping his voice to
deepest tragedy—notes, "if the Axe were waiting in the Lobby at
#. * for Irish Members, it would not deter them from doing
enr duty. -
The House, which has a sharp eye for bathos, laughed consumedl
at this notion; But, upon reflection, it has seriously ..
itself to consideration. It is thought that the Axe waiting in the
Lobby might, if wielded in strong or skilful hands, do service
to Ireland and the Empire. If it were to shorten by a head verbosity,
ignorance, vulgarity, and the deadlier crime of deliberate attempt to
stir up enmity between races, a greater amount of good might be

effected than is usual with so small a measure of compensating evil.
Mr. GLADSToxE has been out of practice with the axe of late; but
perhaps he º: be induced to bring one down to complete the fur-
niture of the Lobby.
Business done.— Mr. McCARTHY's Amendment, proposing that the
Executive should divest itself of the power of carrying out the law,
negatived by 223 votes to 40.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Some Member who sits within the influ-
ence of Mr. WARtoN's snuff-box, has just made a most remarkable
and useful contribution to debate.
I have a pardonable pride in
mentioning the circumstance that
at first there was a general dispo-
sition to think it was the º:
for Barkshire who had thus inter-
pellated his maiden speech. This
was an error; though I am bound
to say that if I had spoken at this
juncture I could not have given
more idiomatic or fuller utterance
to my views. It presently occur-
red to Hon. Members that the
sound did not come from that
part of the House where I usually
sit; and Mr. GRAY gave a precise
turn to suspicion by hailing Mr.
WARTON as the contributor of
what is certainly the most useful
and most pointed speech in a
debate already ten days long,
Mr. WARTON is, however, the soul
of honour, and though it would
have been easy for him to have appropriated the xiàos that belonged
to the anonymous orator, he at once frankly disclaimed the honour.
But the orator was as modest as he was gifted. He persisted in
maintaining his anonymity; but, as it will not occupy much space,
I may as well give a verbatim report of the speech. Said the Hon.
Member, “Shut up !”
Business done—None.
Thursday.—To-night for a brief space, the House of Commons has
resumed its old functions as a Debating Assembly. It was not a
very lively discussion which Sir WILFRID LAwson raised. Nobody
wanted to hear just now about the war in Basutoland, nor as far as
expression went, did anyone seem to have very grave distrust of the
ability and honest intention of the Government to deal with the
uestion. If Sir WILFRID LAwson's speech would have kept, (and
there were singularly few jests in * it might have been as well,
But these things were overlooked in the sense of relief and mental
exhilaration felt at once more hearing men really discuss a question
with evident intent to arrive at a conclusion which argument might
mould, and facts influence. Though not calculated to further any
practical º the discussion really assumed the form of Parlia-
mentary debate. The House liked it too. But it was scarcely
*g. to fall ". poor Sir GEORGE BALFour in the way they
id. Sir GeoRGE has been dumb all the Session, and this was the
very earliest º: he had of making a speech. But no sooner
had he opened his mouth, than with one accord the House roared for
a division, and Sir GEORGE, after feebly battling with the storm,
drooped his wings, and lowered his beak, sinking back into his seat
with the strange pathos of a magpie that has faiiºn #. evil days.
Business done.—Address agreed to. Report on Address carried.
Friday.—Mr. RYLANDs really meant to be good this Session; but
circumstances are sometimes too strong for the best intentions. He
has for so many years had charge of the affairs of the Universe, that
when that portion of them which falls within the limits of the
British Empire is cared for by a man in whom he has the fullest
confidence, he still finds himself involuntarily interposing: É.i.
one will give him credit for the truth of his assertion, that when he
put down, at the beginning of the Session, a Resolution on affairs in
the Transvaal, he did not mean to do anything that would be incon-
venient to anybody, much less to the Government. Of course, after
#. himself with the look of the thing on paper, he might
we taken it off, or he might have sat quiet to-night when .#
Was called on, and his Amendment became ible. But the sudden
º. was too much for him. He his speech ready; in an
evil moment he delivered it, and for the rest of the night was in a
perfect fever of excitement lest some one should take him, at his
word, and insist upon a division. Sir WILFRID Lawson, who will
have his joke, maliciously challenged a division; and to see
et up and leave the House when it was called, followed by Mr.
ARTwRIGHT, who hadFº the right to make a speech at
cost of seconding the endment, was a cheerful conclusion to a
dreary week.
Business done—PETER's Amendment (from which he ran away)
rejected by 129 votes against 33.

PLAYERS AND PAYERS.–NO. III.
“Fire-hook, pipe, bucket, all complete.”—Rejected Addresses.
SoME few years ago, four,
it maybe, or five, a little
pamphlet was published by
the Gallant SHAw, not the
ife-Guardsman of amphi-
theatrical fame, but a more
ractical guardian of our
ife, Captain SHAw, of the
London Fire Brigade. It
was on Fires in Theatres
and a most sensible and
timely little work it might
have been, sending, as it
did, a strong well-directed
stream of good sound advice
on what may truly be styled
a burning question. I say
might have been, for unfor-
tunately too large a part of
it came a little late. The
steed had been stolen before
the Captain undertook to
show us the best sort of
fastenings, for the stable door. . His ideal theatre was,indeed, a
little paradise of comfort and safety: but, as ill-luck will have it,
here stand our theatres, very grave realities, with little of paradise
about them,-for though tolerably easy to º into, they are uncom-
monly hard to get out of and if the barā who sang “The Iloves
of the Angels” knew anything of his subject, 'twas just the reverse
with Paradise in “that time of bloom” commemorated by the late
THOMAS MooRE. Here stand our theatres, I say, and it would,
perhaps, be asking too much to insist they should all be Fºllº down
and built up again on Captain SHAw's most excellent plans.
If some I could name were p down and not built up again on
*hº I do not know that we should be great losers.
he Captain gave, moreover, plenty of advice which we can
rofit by, and ought to be allowed to profit by, but it seems nobody's
usiness that we should. One might suppose it to be the Lord
Chamberlain's, and I think I can remember an emanation from that
august source, following close on the º: heels, which entailed
tremendous penalties on all Theatrical Managers or Lessees who
should dare thereafter to neglect certain sensible and simple regula-
tions framed to ensure the safety of Her Majesty's liege subjects.
But I am not aware that the threatened parties paid much heed, and
I think that his Lordship, after these extraordinary signs of vitality,
pretty soon dropped off to sleep again. ...Twice a year, l have been
told, an official inspection is made of all the theatres and places of
ń. entertainment, within the Bills of Mortality, and a report
urnished, so I imagine some sort of precautions against fire are
supposed to be taken. But what they may be, I don't know, nor
what the penalty of their violation; the latter I take to be some
such as honest Dogberry instructed his watchmen to enact. Indeed,
I sometimes wonder whether, in this one of his many capacities, his
Lordship has any real existence, or is not rather a venerable myth,
in the words of the poet, “the sort of thing one reads about, but
very seldom sees.”
I say then, we must perforce make the best of the theatres we have
already got, and I allow, that in a few of the latest additions to our
Temples of the Drama, some slight regard has been paid to the safety,
as well as to the comfort and luxury, of the visitors; as much, per-
haps, as could, in the circumstances, have been expected, for these
have rather been altered than rebuilt. But the Phoenix'was alto.
gether rebuilt; was that builded on the Captain's plan P and if not,
why not? Most of our. Theatres date from a time when we were not
so wise, nor so careful of our precious lives as we are now. But
surely in no time, no, not even in the time of our toil-bearin
ancestors, should any underground auditoria, have been licensed,
Facilis descensus, but if ever in one of these subterraneous places of
amusement there should be—which Heaven forbid—an alarm of fire
then revocare gradum superasque, evadere ad auras, what an awful
struggle for #. there would be in those narrow mazes | I am alonely
old bachelor, and not so old but that I can take pretty good care of
myself in a growd, yet I protest I always feelyastly thankful to find
myself, again, in #: upper air, sound in limb at least, if not in
wind, for I admit, I don’t find this getting up-stairs as easy as I, did
once. For Pious AEneas, with all the immortals on his side, there
was the labour, that the work l -
. Let us then, I say, make the best we can of our bad bargains; but
is the best made, and if it is not, why does not somebody insist,
why do not we insist, who, after all, are the most nearly concerned,
that it shall be? The Official Circular, I remember, indeed, I happen
to have a copy by me, made it a particular point that “all gangways,
F. and staircases, intended for the exit of the audience, are to
kept entirely free from obstructions, whether permanent or tem-
porary.” Surely a most wise rule and simple, for it must be obvious
to the capacity of even a Theatrical Manager, which is not always, I
fancy, so capacious as his house, that a passage through which you
cannot pass is not of any particular value in cases of sudden emer-
gency. ...Now, this is a rule which I think most playgoers, poor or
rich, will agree with me, is honoured in the breach. There is scarcely,
I make bold to say, a theatre iniondon where this simple and most
necessary precaution is not recklessly disregarded, not once, maybe,
nor twice; but over and over again, whenever some lucky hit happens
to draw the town in larger numbers than the architect bargained
for. It would be Utopian to expect the lucky Manager to turn away
the visitor with money in his hand, in deference to a rule which he
has every reason to laugh at as a dead letter, so long as any hole or
corner can be found in §.. to stow him. No doubt ...Y*:::::::::
is taken behind the curtain, and the regulations frame { Captain
SHAw, much after the fashion of those prescribed on board ship, by
which eyery servant of the theatre would know what to do in case of
fire, and how, and where to do it, would be observed. But in front
of the curtain we, without whom Manager, servants, theatre, could
have no existence, must shift for ourselves. And so, wherever a
chair or stool can be set down, wherever, often, even a couple of legs
can get standing room, there you may find them. I. shudder as I
think of the effect of a panic in the stalls of the little Bandbox
Theatre. In one theatre I know of, the passages between the rows of
the dress-circle are fitted with permanent seats, that can be let down
by a spring whenever the press is greater than ordinary 1 -
I do not say that these things are done everywhere, nor always in
the same proportion, but I do say it is a shame they should be suffered
*::: Some day, I suppose, something will be done—which
ill be very consoling—for the sufferers. They say, we shall never
have done with rai ...Y accidents till a Director is smashed: the
gentle singeing of a Lord Chamberlain might, perhaps, be found an
efficacious remedy for this evil.

neighbourhood of Romsey, some on the Broadlands estate and some near the
Abbey Church.”
We know that “One swallow doesn't make a summer,” and it is
now perfectly clear that neither do several swallows. Some wa
may, peradventure, have written to a newspaper, saying he ha
seen swallows out in mid-winter and affording that information
with a view to a lark of a species not described by naturalists.

OBSTRUCTIVE PADDYISM.
AccordſNG to some sage authorities, History never repeats itself.
Others affirm that it does repeat itself sometimes. How far is History
f. to repeat itself in the House of Commons? In a measure it
as repeated itself already. Obstruction has repeated itself. For
Obstruction is a matter of Parliamentary History. There appears to
be also a remarkable, and really curious coincidence between a case
of Obstruction which occurred once upon a time, and the particular
Obstruction offered by Nationality to Legislation in the present day.
Correspondents of the Times relate that:-
“On the 19th of May, 1604, Sir WILLIAM PADDY, entering into a “long'
speech, it was agreed for a rule that “if any man speak not on the matter in
question, the SPEAKER is to moderate.’”
And so, of course, PADDY was moderated. ...That was one PADDY.
Now at this present there are numerous Paddies habitually creating
Obstruction. The House of Commons in time past moderated an
Obstructive º: Now then, will the Parliament of Queen WIC-
ToRIA prove itself equally well able, with that of JAMES THE FIRST
to put an end to Obstruction by moderating the Obstructive Paddies?
Let us hope that Parliamentary History will so far repeat itself.

“We must secure him as a Volunteer, to fill u

State for War, decisively. - -
The Field Marshal Commanding in Chief bowed submissively, but
shrugged his shoulders. This almost imperceptive demonstration of
incredulity, seemed to lash the already excited Cabinet Minister to
absolute fury.
“Confound it all, your Royal Highness!” he º
“Nay, Sir!” returned the Hero of the Crimea, calmly, but firmly;
“I am aware that you are my official chief, but for all that, I cannot
consent to listen to an imprecation' Your language makes me
shudder!”
The Secretary, seeing that he had gone too far, mumbled an

“You will only open this, Sir, when all other arguments have

The Field Marshal bowed and retired. Within six hours or so, he
had entered his Stanhope Phaeton, had driven down Pall Mall, and
had seated himself in a room in the Horse Guards overlooking St.
James's Park.
“I want to see Private TiroMAs ATKINs,” said the Duke.
The Warrior was sent for, and appeared. ATRINs measured four-
teen inches round the chest, s five feet two in his boots, was
§ fifteen or fifty, and in fact presented the very type of a British
º ler .
“ATRINs,” said the Field Marshal Commanding in Chief, “England
is in danger. We are passing through a serious crisis. , You must
assist us to, reorganise our Land Forces. And first, what is your
Regiment? -> -
“Sergeant said as how it was the 198th, or Putney Plungers, Sir,”
was the hesitating reply.
“A gallant corps, indeed!” commented H.R.H. “The fact,
that nearly all the rank and file were recruited in Canada, I have no
doubt, does not in the least, lessºn,the love they must bear to their
native place—Putney the Pride of the Thames!”
Private ATKINs was silent—perhaps overcome by the Duke's
eloquence. -
“THoMAs,” continued the Field-Marshal, “the 242nd Shoreditch
Slashers are ordered to Timbuctoo, to save the flag and honour of
Old England from being ploughed by the hoof of the ruthless
invader. For various causes (for which, of course, we are none of
us accountable) the Establishment of the Slashers has been reduced
to one bugler, three sergeants, and the usual complement of officers.
The Slashers have a vacancy for a private. Will you volunteer to
accept that unique appointment.”
AfKINs was silent, and scratched his head.
“How long have you been in your present regiment!” asked the
Duke, noticing the soldier's hesitation.
“I don't jº know, Sir ; but counting the time I have spent
in hospital and cells, it may be about three weeks.”
44 weeks!” exclaimed His Royal Highness. “Then I can

ATKINs admitted that he had heard “summut” about it in the
Canteen, but didn't understand what it was all about.
“And knowing this, you refuse, of course, to volunteer out of
your own regiment! Brave lad! Good fellow ! ...There is someº
thing in esprit de corps, after all ! My gallant youth, you can go!”
THoMAs. ATKINs saluted, and turned on his heel.
“Stay!” cried the Royal Duke, as he suddenly remembered the
sealed packet that had been given to him by the Secretary of State
for War, to be used as a last resource. “I have yet something to
do... It is my duty. Listen while I read to you.”
Royal Highness opened the letter, and smiled disdainfully as
he pºrused the contents.
“I do not like to insult you,” he said, “but I am ordered to offer
you a bounty of a pound—”

“REPRESENTATION of Wi-

notice this heading to a
paragraph in the Daily
Telegraph, but were disap-
pointed when, on reading it,
we found it referred to the
election, and not to the
capital comedian who has
been unaccountably absent
from the boards for a long
time. The best “Represent-
ation of WIgAN'' we ever
remember to have seen was
his Hawkshaw the Detective

and before that, in Robson's
time, his Chicken, the ex-
prizefighter, was a Tipton-
slashing performance.
The Connaught Theatre in

management of the experi-
enced Mr. CHARLEs Morton,
who, years ago, worked up the Philharmonic at Islington into a

merrily enough at the Alhambra. It is what Mr., ARTHUR RoBERTS

week. He will be famous in theatrical annals as the creator of Lord
Dundreary, the typical Foppington of John LEECH's time. He had

a flyer in the hunting-field. He was an excellent, stage manager

the fire-front, on either Monday or Tuesday last week-certainly not
Tuesday—to witness Mr. Booth, first as Othello and then as Iago.
With the very slightest hesitation, necessary for the jeu de mots, I
said to myself, ‘I-ar-go not to night;" and, let me add, being a
man of my word, I didn't. I saw the eminent American actor in my
mind's eye, Horatio, and well out of all draughts...The weather

THE eloquence of Mr. McDox-

effect on the Court. In the report
of his s h given in the Free-
man's Journal, January 14, the
Learned Counselisrepresented to
have said:—
“That question struck the Govern-
ment of the country, but was first
prompted by the men who you are
asked to send to gaol. They were the
first to ask the question; they were
the first to hearken to the cry of dis-
tress, and they were the first who
came to the relief of the starving
ple.—The Court then adjourned for
unch.”
The Court couldn't stand the
touching picture—at least it
couldn't sit any longer. It rose
as one man—one very hungry
man—and went to luncheon. Did

SEASONABLE WEATHER,
Old Gent. “Now, You Boys
1881—SO DELIGHTFUL .
I will Not HAVE–” (Snowball /)
TRANSWAALIDITY.
(A Word in Season.)
At a time when Mr. Punch has been in common with all their best
friends, watching, not without some anxiety, though with every con-
fidence, the course pursued by Her Majesty's Ministers, in dealing
with certain exasperating troubles near home, he is the last to put
forward any suggestions likely to cause them embarrassment further
afield. Yet the latest advices from the Cape, have set him thinkin
rather seriously: for, eagle-eyed, and clear-brained as Mr. }.}
admits º, be, he is com eiled to avow, that of all the difficult
and delicate problems he has, for some years, been called upon to
examine and solve, this Boer business seems to him to be about one
of the very worst.
The threads are in an almost inextricable tangle, and rights and
wrongs are so jumbled up, that the excellent law-abiding people who
would send off a British army of 15,000 men to “crush out a
rebellious enterprise,” are no nearer a just estimate of the situation,
than are Mr. Richałd and his enthusiastic friends, who would give
... a struggling community their legitimate liberty.” The last-named
Gentleman would, if logical, dissolve the whole British Empire in
about five minutes, while the former would extend it with something
rather less than the apology of a Darius. But the justum medium is
not evident.
Would it, then, surprise Mr. Punch's friends, who do not read
Blue Books, to learn that these heroic Dutchmen, who are appealing
to their jº have in times past, by their brutality to the
natives, their total inability to govern themselves, and their general
unfitness either to establish or extend civilisation, as understood by
its§º: pioneer, the British Colonist, almost jeopardised the hold
of the white man on South Africa altogether? Would it again sur-
prise his friends further to learn that, notwithstanding these social,
political, and other rather unsayoury drawbacks, Mr. PREToRrus
and his following are unquestionably within their rights in denounc-
ing the Proclamation of Sir THEoPHILus SHEPstone, of April 12th,
1877, as invalid, since he might just as legitimately, by a similar
ent, have tacked on to the H. of the Crown of Eng-
land the Polytechnic Institution in Regent Street?
To put the matter, as Mr. Punch, usually does, into a nutshell,—
ºthere is wrong and right upon both sides. . Before the matter is
allowed to take the proportions of a disastrous and bitterly-contested
campaign, Mr. Punch trusts that some wise and comprehensive basis
for a settlement may be arrived at by a Cabinet not deficient either
in the ready pluck º deals with pressing danger, or the quieter
courage that is not afraid of timely compromise.
SONGS OF THE SCIENCES.–III. GEOLOGY.
SAY, Mastodon, say, how you wandered of yore,
*Mid the Red Crag of Suffolk on Pliocene shore;
The Ichthyosaurus was gone when you came,
With the strange Pterodactyls, what wonderful game!
But the mild Dinotherium rose on your view,
And the festive Rhinoceros lived with you too.
Did you ever conceive with a sort of a shock,
Eozoöns had lived in Laurentian rock;
And then came the fishes with very fine scales.
While the Trilobite waltzed in the waters of Wales.
In the oolites large Labyrinthodons walk,
Till the Ammonites came with the oceans of chalk.
Oh! Mastodon, tell when your troubles began,
From the flint-headed arrows of cave-dwelling man;
Those swells of the Stone Age were gourmets, one owns,
For we've proved that they often enjoyed marrow-bones.
While the size of their joints would make modern men stare.
How Sirloin of Mammoth would please the Lord Mayor
Now we’ll bid you adieu, and we'll read how, in sooth,
The Thecodontosaurus could boast a queer tooth:
How DARwn has told us with labour well spent,
That live types and old fossils have common descent;
With our LYELL we’ll learn how man first had his birth,
And with MURCHIson study the crust of the earth!

SCHOOL-BOARD PAPERS.–No. 4.
IN addressing people, there are many daily blunders which you should strive
to avoid. Ifiſ". are addressing your superiors, you should try to do credit to
the Board; if you are addressing your inferiors, you should set them a good
example. You should always tone down your º and place them as
close as possible to the nouns they qualify. You sho never speak, as house-
agents do, of an “antique gentleman's residence,” but should say a “gentle-
man's antique residence,” showing that the house is old and not the gentleman.
The aisle of a church is pronounced “ile,” but oil has not by any means the
same pronunciation, Always should not be written “allways,” but should
always be written always. You should be very careful in the use of negatives.
It is not elegant or correct to say, “I never cares not nothing (sometimes
mispronounced nuffin) for nobody.” If you have to ask for throat-lozenges
you call them bronchial troches, and you, pronounced the words * bronºlai
trokez.” Chough is pronounced “chuff,” but cough is pronounced “koff,”
and borºugh is pronounced “burrow.” We must take things as we find them.
Derby is “Darby,” Berkeley is “Barkly,” and Colquhoun is “Coon.” In
writing spoonful you only use one l; in writing dunghill you use two. Encore
is pronounced “ong-kor,” and ennui “on'-nyvä.” Guillotine may easily be
confounded with gelatine, unless you are careful; and Bourgeois, if it means a
middle-class Frenchman, is pronounced “bougewar;” if it means a certain
kind of type, it is pronounced burjoyce. Iago is pronounced “Yah-go,” whether
§º. is bad or good, and jºu. is “Zhak” in French, and “Jakes”
in E º except on the stage, where it becomes “Jake-quees.” Perspiration
should never be pronounced “prespiration,” though that is even better than
saying “a muck of sweat.” Radish, even if it is reddish, should not be pro-
nounced “reddish.” Rains, reigns, and reins are easily confounded, if you are
not careful, though their different meanings, must be evident to the meanest
capacity. A suite of furniture is pronounced “sweet,” whether the furniture
comes from GILLow or Tottenham Court Road, and this
shows the folly of importing French words into a lan-
uage so rich as the English. The use and abuse of the
f. H are subjects I could say much upon, but until
the authorities have settled the correct pronunciation of
hospital, herb, and humour, I prefer to remain silent.
SEASONABLE WEATHER.
(A Back-Street Ballad.)
THE hum of those skate-irons sounds in my ear;--
Or is it the wail of the driving wind?
There, in the Park, all was gladness and cheer.
And the blast, that was blowing my old eyes blind,
Reddened the cheeks of the º; gir -
As they bent to its gusts and in frolicsome whirls
Flew—flew—flew 1–And my girl liesthere!
White as the winter, still as the snow,
And, but for a few rags of raiment, as bare
the wind-swept flags below. -
And that hum beats time in my half-dazed brain
To her moan of pain—to her moan of pain,
Till my lips could writhe with a maddened curse
# the º tº º º ºlink
e rich world's joy and its gold-plum urse
With a scene like §: ! Ah, to º to tº:
Of these helpless hands—they are dead with cold-
That have no more power, alas ! to hold
The thing they love, than that empty grate
Towarm this garret bare;
And I dream if the rich folk roystering there
Knew half the pinch of º fate,
When streams are frozen, and blood runs slow
In frost-chilled veins, and the cruel snow,
Aye, cruel, though white as an angel's wings,
Blocks the ways of work to such drudges as we,
It would check, which were pity, their noisy glee.
Yes, they'd shiver, and sigh, “Poor things!”
As a passing thought of us robs their laugh
Of a Üß or so, they will shudder, then quaff
A little deeper the warming wine;
And how should they guess how a bit of fire
Would make my girl's eyes widen and shine?
Well, a thrice-told tale will tire,
And Poverty's wail
Is a thrice-told tale.
Hark! here it blusters, the driving gale
Bearing the snow-dust, finer than rain,
Worming its way through the curtainless pane;
And the shrunken door, as though eager, mad,
To pinch yet bluer our frost-numbed feet.
There is wild work sea-ward to-night,
And watchers and workers on shore are glad
To crouch in corners. And yet to meet,
On sea or on land, in a fair hard fight,
Cold on the wave with the life-boat crew;
Cold on the cliff or the wide white moor;
Cold in the streets, 'gainst the hoarsest roar
Of the blackest North-easter that ever blew
Were better; 'twere battle, and battle will warm
The stagnant blood in the frailest form.
But helpless Poverty huddled alone
By an empty grate, with a sick girl's moan
Beating its ears in a vain appea
For one ray of warmth, for the scantiest meal .
Were maddening, but that a frost-numbed brain
Is all too sluggish for phrenzy’s strain.
Not a crust in the cupboard-no!
Not a stick to kindle—none!
And when will that North wind cease to blow,
And the falling flakes have done
Their soft white devil-dance? Hush! "Twere brave
Did they only dance it over our grave.
Then the steely hum of those skates might sound
Cheerily on; as the very voice
Of wealth and comfort, that dare rejoice
When the bitter winter the pools has bound,
Nor like chill mockery beatin my brain
Blent with the wail of the sick girl's pain.

Monday ſº of any Week.-Let me see! What's the º

my Land Bill of 1870? Read a book of the Odyssey, to console me. Find it
doesn't console me at all. Query. Aren't sufferings of Ulysses exaggerated by
Hoy E.R.? Did Ulysses ever listen to an Irish Obstructive? Write sixteen post-
cards, and rattle off a parallel (for Nineteenth Century) between much-suffering
Ulysses, troubled with Sirens, and myself ditto with Home-Rulers. Send it

caiſed a siren before nor did I. "I think I shall write an Epic entitled “The
Much Enduring Ulysses (myself) and Impatient Parnellope.”
11 A.M.–Boy comes to say, Deputation of Irish Members wants to see me.
Don't want to see them. Query, Can it be “Impatient PARNELLOPE” and
Suitors in a fit of remorse? -
No ; only moderate Home-Rulers come to ask me to “re-consider Land
Bill.” Say they're afraid there won't be anything about the “Three F.'s"
in it. I say I don't know at present what will be in it. They ask if I don't
believe in the “Three F.’s.” Fº pertinacious curiosity disgusting. I reply
by some general remarks on the state of the weather, the prospects of the
potato-crop, the Gulf Stream, &c. They leave apparently quite satisfied.

10 A.M.–Rather, heavy, correspondence awaiting me this morning. Angry
letter from "Greek patriot,” wanting to know why I didn't at once give
Thessaly and Epirus to Greece. Send post-card, referring him to GAMBETTA.
Twenty-six Midlothian electors want my autograph, my opinion on “Sabbath
trayelling,” and my views—if any—on hypothed. Very flattering communi-
cation from a Home-Rule organisation in Donegal: “perfect confidence in me:
feel sure I'll never rob Irish tenants of advantages they’ve gained by constitu-
tional agitation,” &c. Find the advantages they’ve gained so far by constitu-
tional agitation are that they pay no rent, and that their landlords are either
starving in England, or “Boycotted” in Ireland. Dictate
conciliatory post-card. Nothing like por populi, after all.
10:30.-Read newspapers for half-an-hour. All of
'em urging “strong measures” — and blaming me !
ry—who was it who said something about “chatter
of irresponsible frivolity?” Must have been a very
clever—oh, Lord B., to be sure! Ah, well—rather a
vulgar remark, after all.

SPEAKER. Former has lots of precedents. It seems
SPEAKER is right person to interfere with Obstructives.
SPEAKER says he'd rather I did it. I’d much rather he
º it. We both suggest that THoRoid Rogers should

do with Obstructivesin Russia. Wires back—“Siberia.”
Too stringent. Wire to GARFIELD, asking ditto in

may superinduce cerebral phlegmatosis.

repudiate suggestion. Says he doesn't know what I
mean by “repudiate: ” if I mean I'll take it, that’s all

Questions for the Kyrle Society.

the sculptor made the Griffin's tail Kyrley?
A Sum.

borough House and St. Martin's Church (and there are
quite that number), each provided with a beseeching

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
the English and Scotch. The last touch was given to the impres:
siveness of the scene by the fact that the Parliamentarily disembodied
LycIDAs looked down upon it, heard the lament of his faithful
friends, and watched the scornful attitude of his hereditary enemies.
Though the body of Obstruction was under hatches on the floor of
the House, its soul had gone aloft to the Strangers' Gallery. Here he
sat—known in the flesh as JoE BIGGAR, in poetry
as LYCIDAs—whose untimely end his compatriots
bemoaned. But a short time since he was
standing over there, buttressed about with blue
books. He had come in full of hope and statis-
tics. Great things were expected of him, and
he meant to equal expectation. Illustrious men
are often spurred on to desperate acts by rivalry
with themselves. Mr. BiggaR had made his
Parliamentary fame ği speech of four hours'
length. That was while his career was yet
opening. Now it had been long and gloriously
established, and it became the veteran to out-
shine the deed of the youth.
So Mr. BiggaR entered, weighed down on
one side with blue-books, and with a gleam in
his eye, which told of coming conflict. When
his turn came he rose with the grace that dis-
tinguishes every movement, and, holding out
his right hand, shook it with fingers loosely
down-dropped in the direction of the SPEAKER.
This is a semaphore signal with which Mr.
BRAND is only too well acquainted. It means
that, for an indefinite period, all Parliamentary traffic must be
stopped. Stopped it was now, whilst Mr. BIGGAR spread about him his
§: and having fixed his glasses astride his nose, and suspended
- right hand by the thumb hooked in the arm-hole of his waistcoat,
began to discuss matters generally. He had not gone far before the
SPEAKER called him to order, Mr. BIggaRoccupying the few seconds
of interval thus supplied, by º his papers. Once more
on his feet, he travelied a little f er and was again called to
order. This happened three times, Mr. BIGGAR, growing accustomed
to the process, utilising it more obviously and with greater satisfac-
tion in looking through his notes, and preparing fresh extracts for
F. reading as soon as the SPEARER would be pleased to sit down.
t appeared to him, however, that it would be as well, rather in the
general interest than in his own, if he should have authoritatively
settled a question that was always arising. What was order P3. It
was not like a side of bacon, that you could feel and weigh, and
“WELL,I’MSHAw!”
smell, and if need be, taste. It was an abstract something, now here the Church
evaded, the clutch, like the ghostly dagger
that haunted Macbeth. Would it not be well to have this matter
settled, and was there any time better than the present? Mr.
BIGGAR thought not; and so, łºś all his papers to the end
that he might hook both hands by the thumb within the hospitable
recess of his waistcoat, and with head cocked a little on one side,
he proceeded in his endeavour to solve the difficulty.
“Mr., SPEAKER, Sir,” he said, the metallic tones of his voice
modified by earnest, inquiry. “Now, what is order?” For all
reply the SPEAKER “named "Mr. BIGGAR; and before that great
Patriot quite knew, where he was, he found Mr. FoESTER putting
the question that he be suspended from further service in the
House. To some men it might have occurred that since by some
sudden, turn of fortune he had become the object of personal and
particular discussion, a dignified course would-be to leave the com-
pany. . Mr. BIGGAR took another view of his duty. Perhaps he
was waiting for
the answer to his
question;, per-
haps he thought
that he of all
men should have
a voice in the
decision. How-
ever it be, he not
only remained,
but voted in the
division. Even
when the figures
were announced,
and his suspen-
sion decreed, he
showed no signs
of initiating ac-
tion. Perhaps if
he waited a little
lºnger, the SPEAKER would tell him what order was. Instead of which
the SPEAKER, “observing the Hon. Member for Cavan in his place,”
º him to withdraw; which he did with a graceful smile, and
a few cheery words to the Sergeant-at-Arms, who was so polite as
now there, but ;

to show him to the door. A few minutes later he was discovered up
in the Strangers' Gallery in friendly converse with the doorkeeper,
himself unmoved, while below his bereaved friends filled the dank
night with illimitable lament.
“Weep no more, woeful Shepherds, weep no more;
For LycIDAs your sorrow is not dead,
Sunk though }. be beneath the watery floor.
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,
And tricks his beams, and with new spangled oar
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky:
So LycIDAs, sunk low, has mounted high.
Business done.—Mr. BIGGAR suspended.
Thursday Night.—The House of Commons is very like what Ifancy
the sea must be. Sometimes you look over the expanse of green
benches and everything is quiet, even humdrum. Suddenly a breeze
arises. A quick commotion fills the place. Members, hurrying in,
crowd up the seats and stand at the Bar. The storm blows with
ever increasing fury, and sometimes, as happened on Tuesday night,
Mr. BiggaR is flung like a §. of seaweed on the rocks (here repre-
sented by the Strangers' ery). After a while the storm goes
own as suddenly as it arose, and the next evening, when you come
to look on the scene, lo!, the wind is hushed; the wayes are s
and the stranded seaweed, sun-dried during the day, has dropped o
the rock, and is once more gently º in the summer sea.
Thus it is to-night. The House is full but quiet, and eminently
respectable. Mr. BiggaR has been restored to its bosom, and occu-
yies his usual place thereon. No one, unless it be Mr. Giansroºr,
s the slightest traces of having sat up all night. The PREMIER,
truly, looks ill and worn, and has the restless movement which tells
how sorely his nerves have been overwrought. When in his usual
good health he finds it impossible to sit still and listen to inanity or
impertinence with the imperturbability that has
made long life possible and agreeable to Lord
BEACONSFIELD. en mind and body are over-
wrought this absence of self-control is more
painfully marked, and to-night those who hold
the PREMIER's life precious, watch him with
ve face as he excitedly shakes his head, whilst
r. O'Connoh Power is speaking, and anon
interpellates remarks inaudible above the din of
the Representatives of Ireland who sit below the
gangway opposite, and make mock of the man
who delivered their country from the thrall of
e , and is even now working to complete
the deliverance of its land from the grip of the
rack-renter. -
“If GLADSTONE could only keep himself quiet!”
Lord HARTINGTON growls, as he thrusts his hands
in his pockets, tips his hat over his nose, and
prepares to take charge of the ship, which on
the iroke of midnight the Pºmer hands over
to him. Then the *...* cheers subside, the
interruptions cease, and the broad smile that
festoons the lower part of Mr. BIGGAR's expres-
sive countenance disappears. The Irish Members
look across at the Treasury Bench; and, .* - -
that they might as well attempt to remove the Griffin in Fleet
Street by battering it with their heads, as try to disturb Lord
Hºnºrs with their contumely, they subside, and presently go
Orne.
Business done.-None.
Friday Night-The debate on the First Reading of Mr. FoESTER's
first Coercion Bill was to be concluded to-night, and Hon. Members
came down prepared to do their duty. But it appears that as yet
we had only touched the skirts of the question. There are scores
of gentlemen ready to boil over with words of counsel, and floods of
eloquence. It seems we don't know nearly enough yet ºf the
views of the Irish Members; and that if, after talking of the one
thing for three weeks and a night, a decision which every one is
º to give, were straightway to be taken, it would be an
undue limitation of freedom of, speech. Freedom of speech, is
already strictly limited to one side of the Channel; and to-night,
when Mr. GLADstone proposed to state his views, he was ru §
and violently interrupted from the Irish quarter in a way I am tol
the like of which has not hitherto been seen in the House.
Business done,—None.

the administration of Forty Millions sterling a year—or a sum equal
to one half of the Imperial revenue. If Grumbledom and Fumble-

STRANGLING THE MONSTER.
Extract from a Forthcoming New Edition of Lemprière. (Irish Version.)
THE O'Cacus was a famous depredator, son of O'Tellus and Eris
§ Discordia) by some erroneously confounded with the nymph
rin, and bearing a marked family resemblance to his grandparent
Chaos. Like Polyphemus as described by Virgil, he was—
“Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, qui lumen ademptum.”
He was a three-headed monster, and from his several and un-
shut-up-able mouths vomited forth fire and fury on all such as
opposed or angered him. For twenty-four hours at a stretch had the
Ogre been known to spout out unintermittent lava floods from his
inexhaustible vocal volcanoes. He resided for the most part in
Hibernia, and ever plotted to plunder the surrounding country. He
dwelt in the gloomy recesses of the Hills (Ills he called them) of
Erin, was vengeful as the Erinyes themselves, and the Avenues of
his Avernus were strewn with the remains of slaughtered cattle, and
with dead men's bones.
When Hercules returned from the conquest of Ben D’Yrmion, the
O'Cacus “conveyed ” some of his Bulls (for the most part of the
breed known as John Bulls, though some were Hibernian ones) and
dragged them into his cave, terrifying them into submission by the
most dreadful and mysterious menaces. Hercules, after partaking
of Makarthus's hospitality, was on the point of proceeding quietl
on his way without discovering the extent of the difficulty into .
the O'Cacus had drawn him; but his John Bulls' loud bellowings
were answered feebly from the Cave of the O'Cacus, and the hero
thus realised his loss and the new labour before him. He therefore
attacked the O'Cacus, and, after a desperate conflict, during which
the Monster vomited' forth even more fire and fury than was his
º: wont,...strangled him in his arms, and erected the Ara
aximato Jupiter Liberator, in commemoration of his victory.
a"&6. the poet describes the encounter between Alcides and
e U Uacus :-
The cave of the O'Cacus, bared to sight,
Glared with the force of late-admitted light:
The long-pent vapours with a thunderous sound
Heaved from beneath and shook the rocks around.
The Commons, breathless, as the fight they view,
Bend from their seats and watch the desperate two.
- + + + -
Graceless O'Cacus's three mouths expire
Mixture of lurid smoke and lambent fire;
In hope the hero to obfuscate quite,
And so prevent his taking aim aright.
But great Alcides through them fought his way,
Nor turned nor paused until he grasped his prey.
The monster spouting fruitless flame he found,
Gripped his three throats, and raised him from the ground.
Choked in mid air, his crippled members coiled
In a close knot, the Incubus was foiled.
The Bulls, now freed, breathed open air again,
Safe from the despot warder of the den.
The wondering populace, with glad surprise,
Beheld hiº triple head, his horrid size,
His mouths that spout no more, and his extinguished eyes.
“CLIPPING !”

gow Herald:—

to stand it. Precious Black joke this, though.

FROM THE RANKS.
III.-Fare and Unfair.
YEs, Sir. It's
crule to have to
| sayit, but “Babes
| in the hands of
the Bilkers” is
about what we
are: We ought
to have eyes in
3the backs of our
* heads, and three
of them, at least,
to avoid the shoals
and pitfalls that
are spread to trip
us up. Ah, Sir!
I there's the affec-
|tion ate bilk.
What do you
think of that?
| I’ve seen seve
specimens of that
| lot. There was a
§§§ lady as had just
- S ! returned from
SSº". India to look at
Sºsº her blessed hus-
2. Bººs
>s I know the way
to Brompton
Cemitary? Of course I did. She had a smile like a cherubim.
And then she wanted a nice quiet lodging, with a bit of garden, and
we were several days looking for it, and when we weren't looking
for it she had tears in her eyes, and smiled at me dreamily as she
thought of her dead husband. i took quite a fancy to that sweet
lady as loved her husband so, and it stuck in my throat to bother
her for a few shillin
and not settled with her things. And then when she did get settled,
and I called, she asked me into the parlour, instead of leaving me on
the door-mat, and made me sit down, and wanted to know what I
thought of the carpet-pattern and of the portrait of the lost one,
who was a stout gent, over the chimney, with a bull neck, and a
uniform, and when I said something about my money she looked
wild and spoke of her cheque-book and how great a privilege it was
to be able to do a little good to those we love—and cried a bit—and
then cheering up, asked me to go and fetch the cab and take her
for a drive, being so low-spirited, for I'd have cause to bless her
some day. So I took her (as great a fool as Jºãº for lots
of drives and shopping and that, and got into a scrapes at home
and deep in debt to old SKINNUM, and was obliged to pawn my
Sunday suit and the few things I had, to keep at all above water,
and not get the sack, and I don't know where it would have ended,
if I hadn't one day seen the bill put up “To Let” in those windows
where she used to sit smiling that intoxicating smile. All the
tradesmen were shouting round the door. She owed me many pounds,
of which I never saw a farthing, and that served me jolly well right
for being such an old fool as to be took in by a artful woman's flat-
: rubbish; and the months of hard work it took me to pull
navse ther after she had bolted, were a judgment on me.
utif there’s so much of the ugly side .*. met within the cab-
trade, why do honest men turn cabby ? Well, because there's a fas-
cination in the uncertain life, and the liberty. You can go where
you like, and smoke a pipe when you like, and be at no one'sbeck and

see a party hail you, and don't like his face, it’s easy to say you’ve

exill get inside, you’ve only to crawl till he's exasperated and too
delighted to get out again. One day a prize, the next a blank, taking
the and the good together, like a sort of lottery. You start on a
bright morning, like a rover searching for adventure; without know-
ing what'll come of it... You feel your wits are pitted against other
wits, which is exhilarating if you began as a gutter-snipe. You’ll
tumble against queer people, during the time you're out, and
you’ll be setracking your brains as to who and what they are; and
you’ll see 'em do things as 'll make your hair stand on end—for
somehow they don’t count Cabby as anything more than a bit of fur-
niture, and they’ll do things before him which they’d be ashamed
to do * insecret. It's scarifying sometimes to see their shame-
ess. They lay bare the black parts of their lives to you, some
of 'em, with a recklessness that’s wonderful. If I was a detective
and wished to study a man, I'd disguise myself as a cabby and
throw myself in his way. He mightn't nibble for a cast, or two,
but if played properly he'd bite at last, and throw off the mask

SCHOOL-BOARD PAPERS.–No. 5.
Before taking leave of you and this subject, perhaps you will
allow me to say a few words on the virtue of humility. You must
not despise your elders who were born in an age when ratepayers
were not benevolent, and the rule in matters of education was—“the
devi take the hindmost.” You must not idol with contempt on
your father and mother, or your uncles and aunts, because they find
a difficulty in aspirating the letter H, in asking for a beefsteak at
Boulogne, or in spelling or pronouncing words of more than two
syllables. If you correct them when you notice their shortcomings,
it must be in the most delicate manner. If you know they are wrong
you must not say so, but must gently hint that authorities differ on
certain points, and that the generally received spelling or pronuncia-
tion of certain words is so-and-so or so-and-so. You must behave
with the utmost politeness to the working classes. You must not
order them to work as if they were slaves and you were a slave-
driver, but you must ask them if they will kindly oblige you by
executing a certain task at their own time and pleasure for a remu-
neration quite inadequate, though generally considered liberal. You
must anticipate their weakness for the dinner-hour by requesting
them to take it much earlier and prolong it much later. You must
be liberal in the matter of beer, and not obstinate in the matter of
tobacco, even during the hours of labour. Instead of leaving them
to assert their claim to a half-holiday on Saturday and a late arrival
on Monday, you should request them not to work after sunset on
Friday night until midday on Monday. Leisure is the gift of the gods,
and no man should be deprived of it. Do not enquire too curiousl
how this leisure is utilised. One man may distribute tracts whic
he does not read; another man may read tracts which he does not
distribute. One man may prefer the simple game of skittles to the
“elaborate frivolity” of chess; and another man may despise both,
and prefer to spend his time and money in increasing the Excise
revenue of his country. Seated, as you are, on a lofty pinnacle, in
the upper regions of education, you can afford to loºk down with
charitable tolerance on the weakness of those who were born before
you. . Their intellect may be equal to yours, but their training is
inferior, and it is your own fault if the world is not governed in
future by able-minded paupers.
THE TELEGRAPH MONOPOLY.
THE Telegraph Monopoly—popularly known as the Post Office—is
proving, if any proof were needed, that no Government can be
trusted. Tory, Conservative, Liberal, or Radical, are all alike when
the law gives them, or leads them to believe that it has given them,
unlimited powers as traders. The so-called Post Office, having made
a bad and improvident bargain with the Telegraph Companies, is
determined to burke invention, and earn an evil reputation as the
champion of everlasting stagnation. The impertinent inventors of
the Telephone have been made aware of this in a court of law, and
are how made even more bitterly aware of it in their subsequent
negotiations with the Government. - -
n the first place they are told they must be taxed, and this is a
communication they can hardly be astonished at. Nearly every living
thing in this country is taxed, except vermin—the child in its
cradle, the dying-man on his The only thing practically
exempt, is the corpse in its coffin. However sluggish the Govern-
ment may be, the tax-gatherer is superhumanly active. A Goyern-
ment that once taxed the light of Heaven, can see no injustice in
taxing a Telephone wire. In the second iace, the impertinentin-
ventors are told that their radius must be limited. - -
Because the Government wasted ten millions of public money in
1866, the Telephone Company may carry their wires to Stoke-Pogis
and no further. The ğ. licy in one department of
Government, necessitated a money-grubbing policy in another. If
this Government, that Government, or any Government, had bought
the Water Companies, half the kingdom would have been dying of
thirst; and if they had bought the Stage-coach interest, railways
would never have been built; or if built, would have been allowed no
further than Hampstead and Camberwell.

ROUND ABOUT TOWN.
The Torophilite Grounds, Regent's Park.
In the summer time I imagine the Toxophilites are rather a quiet
body. They possess a sort of neglec kitchen-garden in the
Regent's Park. To make up for their not very pretentious.“real
property” (from its position I fancy it must have been a gift from
the Crown) they have erected a kindo #. edition of a baronialhall
in a secluded portion of the grounds. This pocket edition of a baronial
hallis chiefly remarkable for stained-glass windows...antlers, queer
inscriptions, and an enormous fire-place. The architect no doubt
was tºld that he might “revel” in the hearth, and he seems tº have
strictly obeyed his instructions. The fire-place was º 111-

baronial affair was only a summer-house.” en, I saw it, it was
closed, its , place being

connected with the original
structure by a yard or two
of neat iron piping. Very
likely this departure from

necessitated by the chim-
ney smoking, or some other
domestic galamity of a
kindred character, For

who have given up their ground to the Skating Club.
In spite of the snow it was not difficult to find my way, to the
rink. Numbers of nice young Ladies and determined-loºking
middle-aged Gentlemen were going in the same direction, I fol-
lowed them. A wooden gate was, opened, by a brisk Commis-
sionaire, who welcomed me with a military salute full of encºurage-
ment. His eagle glance divined, in a moment that I (like Mr.
Winkle) was a “little awkward” on a pair of skates. I passed
him with an assumption of dignity, and came to the rink. It seemed
to be a flooded lawn. It was surrounded by snow, out, of which
ped here and there an aged target, which apparently had been
}. there in the summer by some toxophilite, too languid to carry
it back proudly to the Archer's Hall with him, as a trophy of the
chace. H. these targets had their value, Round the frozen, water
were one or two aged ladies, who shivered, and cast glances at º
cheeked damsels who were seen disporting themselves gaily on the
ice in the distance. Now and then these damsels gleefully approached
the veteran dowagers, and cheerily asked them “how they were
tting on?”. The aged dowagers then attempted to hide their
shiverings, and nodded more or less merrily. In a moment, the rosy-
cheeked damsels were off to another part of the rink, and the
dowagers were once more alone. Then the , targets.came, into
requisition. The dowagers em º their ample leisure in prodding
them thoughtfully with an umbrella! -
Leaving these "sad ones,” (as they would have been called in the
English libretto to an Italian º
to their own mournful, reflections,
came to a much more cheerful sight.
A young lady of singularly prepos-
sessing appearance was performing
some extremely intricate evolutions
round what should have been—and
no doubt was —a very happy orange.
The young lady now advanced coquet-
tishly, then retired with a graceful
curve. I thought she was gone for
ever, when, in a moment, with a
gentle glide, she was once more close
to me. She hovered about that orange
like a bee upon a flower. As I noted
her charming performances, I came
to the conclusion that I was watching
a very pretty figure. I felt almost
annoyed when she was called away
by a short stout gentleman, to form
a party of four with two other ex-
tremely disagreeable-looking persons
to take her place, in what seemed to me to be a sort of mad *:::::
Having now nothing better to do, I turned my attention to the antics

watching, did not lack the decoration, or I should have imagined
that one of them at least was in statu pupillari.
“Can you do this?” asked the first of the other, and he started
off as if he had been subjected to an electric shock, which had
deprived him temporarily of all control over his legs. Fortunately his
lower members seemed to be on kindly terms with the remainder of
his body, and, after two or three wavering moves, brought him round
in a circle, without causing him any serious injury. His friendshook
his head, and adopted a feeble smile, apparently assumed with the
intention of disarming criticism.
. “I don't know, but I will try,” he murmured, as he attempted to
imitate the movement. The effort entailed great labour, but was
F. successful. He struck off with an energy born of resigna-
tion, and his legs, too, carried him round in a circle out of danger.
Then he absolutely beamed with satisfaction, and boldly stooped
down to place the inevitable orange in another position.
“Very good!” said his instructor, with an air of intense patronage.
“Now we will try something else!” I heard at my §. and
noticed that the Champion Skater was on the eve of re-commencing

"I am not quite sure you will be able to manage this just yet,”

He glanced at those near him as if inviting their serious attention,
and observing cheerily, “I shall cut a pretty fi ,” was taken by
his legs into the air, and—sat down! He did not lose his compo-

familiarity with the manoeuvre, and added: “I, told you, it was
rather difficult, but take my word for it, with a little ractice, you
will do it as well as I do!” And at this point of his lecture I
thought it time to leave, and return to a comfortable fire-side at

A GROWL,
(From a Frozen-out Traveller.)
SIR,-We all have been more or less affected by the inclemency
of the weather, º cisterns, frozen meters, and pitfalls in the
shape of slides artfully manufactured by malicious urchins. I do
not resist exorbitant cab-fares as I invariably walk. But what have
I done that I am compelled to trust myself once a week to the tender
mercies of the South-Western Railway Company? Are my social
offences so grave that I should expiate them by having to travel, for
an hour a half, a distance that on most other lines would be done
in half that time, in a first class carriage that must have been pur-
chased second-hand from the Midland Railway Company at the time
they discarded their second class compartments. ranting the
South-Western Railway Company a monopoly of dirty and uncom-
fortable carriages, why should not the luckless travellers on this
line have at least the consolation of knowing that they will arrive
at their destination within half-an-hour of the time specified in
the Company's Time-tables? Or, allowing even the privilege of
arbitrary delays to the Company, might we not expect, in this
somewhat trying weather, our poor feet to be comfo by the grate-
ful foot-warmer during the occasional twenty minutes wait between
stations? I admit that I have seen a foot-warmer on this line. It
was provided for a young *. She was young and lovely. I
am neither, but that's all the more reason I should have had the
foot-warmer.
As the authorities of the London and South-Western Line seem to
have a natural propensity for getting themselves into hot water, why
don't they put a lot of it into hot bottles for the lºng-ºring public,

A SHOCKING OCCURRENCE.
SwitzERLAND on the 27th instant, was visited thrice during the
day, in several places, with a touch of the earthquake reported
by wire. It caused both a lateral and vertical oscillation, preceded
by a subterranean rumble, made the clocks of churches to strike and
their bells to toll, shook books off their shelves, detached pictures
from the walls, and, in Berne, for one place, threw down more than
one hundred chimneys; but beyond that, appears not to have done
any notable damage. The people, therefore, who experienced the
shock, were much more frightened than hurt; but so much frightened,
some of them, that—
“Children and teachers ran pell-mell from schools, and all study had to be
given up for the day.”
“Study given up for the day!” Qh, won't English school-boys

Mowdar Night, Jan. 31.-It was one of the few fitting things in
the proceedings that, the echoes of midnight having long rolled
away into the still night, a gentleman named GABBETT rose to move
the adjournment of the debate on the First Reading of the Protection
Bill. As far as family name went, this was all very well. But
the House is at length tired of this travesty of freedom of debate,
nd uproariously cheered when Mr. GLADSTONE, in the fewest pos-
sible words, announced that the Motion would be resisted.
This was what all the real business of the evening has led up to.
The SPEAKER has been in the Chair, the Mace has been on the Table
the Sergeant-at-Arms has worthily presided in the Vice-Chair; aii
the accustomed sights and sounds of a Sitting in the House has been
observable. But it is outside in the Lobby that the real business of
the night's Sitting has been accomplished. Here Lord Rich ARD
GBosvenoR, working harder and for longer hours than would be
ible under the º: is making arrangements by which
embers may come and Members may go, but the Sitting shall run
on for ever, or at least till the division on Mr. FoESTER’s Bill be
taken. At the door, invigorated: by a too brief Sunday, in the
country, cheery Mr. Cotes, with book in hand, is ticking off Members
as they come and go, cautiously sounding them as to their preference
for :::::::::::: night or getting up early in the morning, and
promptly ing them for one or the other “shift.” Sir WILLIAM

DYKE, whom everyone is glad to'see back in the House, turns up in

revels in the prospect with the delight of an old war-horse.
It seems, when you come to think of it, a funny way of passing an
Act of Parliament, but just now there is none other; and if Irish
Members were as wise as they are loquacious, they would take note
of this stern enthusiasm that is obliterating all parties and sections

of parties, making the one common bond of union a desire to re-
establish authority in the House of Commons.
Business done.—Got ready to sit all night.
Tuesday.—Mr. NEwdeGATE, smiling knowingly, throws up his
hands, shakes his head, and beats his knees, in token of arrival at
the conclusion that there never were
such things seen in the House of
Commons—whether at the corner seat
of the fourth bench below the gang-
way, or elsewhere. It is midnight,
and the House has now been sitting,
without intermission, for thirty-two
hours. The Irish Members, few in
number, but unfettered by the con-
siderations that ordinarily maintain
discipline among bodies of gentlemen,
have taken that time-honoured insti-
tution, the British House of Commons,
by the throat, have flung it i.
miniously on its back, and have been
mercilessly kneeling on its chest.
One might say that this, the so-called
mightiest assembly in the world, is
like Gulliver in Lilliput.
Just now there are signs of
movement in the sleeping giant.
Oddly enough, though I believe
such things sometimes happen in the
Pantomime and in real life, the
first person to feel the weight of re-
awakened authority, is one of the
. . most inoffensive., Mr. T. D. SUL-
LIVAN, though not lacking in courage, has neither the ponderosity
of speech that distinguishes Dr. CoMMINs, nor the pertness that
makes Mr. DAwson insufferable, nor the coarse vulgarity that in the
person of Mr. HEALY libels on the floor of the House of Commons
the Irish peasant class. Yet it is on Mr.T. D. SULLIVAN that the big
guns of the Opposition suddenly brought into play, open fire. Of
course, fiasco followed. The SPEAKER could not rule Mr. SULLIVAN
out of order, and the well-meant, but ill-directed attempt failed.
Mr. MILBANK, succumbing to the excitement of the movement, and
seeing double, jumped up when Mr. DILLON had been twice
called to order, and declaring that he had four times been cautioned
invoked the thunder of the Chair. But the Chair, rather embarrassed
than assisted by these wild attacks, declined to act, remained immov-
able when Sir STAFFORD Northcote pricked the sides of its intent,
and was not to be incited to premature action, even when Mr. W. H.
SMITH made, from the front Opposition Bench, a third appeal.
Then came chaos, and departed the Leaders of Her Majesty's
Opposition. They had thrice warned the Chair, and now in accord-
ance with the spirit of Parliamentary discipline, they proceeded to
punishment. ith angry gesture the º mild and placable Sir
STAFFoRn rose, and with stiff obeisance
to the Chair, left the House, accom-
anied º Sir MICHAEL HIcks-BEACH,
W. W. H. SMITH, and some others.
At the gangway the Fourth Party,
who but yesterday pledged their sup-
port to a pleased Ministry, joined their
forces to the out-going stream, as,
ever broadening, it reached the door
and passed out amid thunderous cheers
from the Home-Rulers; Mr. PARNELL
himself standing pale and motionless
the while, waiting for § to
speak. Then Mr. MILBANK, standing
well out, on the floor of the House,
waving his hat as if it were a drawn
sword, cheered on Her Majesty's
Ministers to the support of the Chair.
His enthusiastic demeanour drew
forth from some gentleman opposite
a chilling remark of a personal character.

(Not ARTHUR).
This brought up Mr.
enunciatory gesture
towards Mr. BIGGAR, whom he accused of uttering the unparlia-
mentary phrase. Then, somehow or other, amid the confusion a
Division befell, and when the Tellers came back Mr. BIGGAR reported
to the Deputy Speaker that Mr. MILBANK had walked across the
floor of the House and observed to him (the Member for Cayan)
‘..Mr. BIGGAR, Sir, you are an impudent scoundrel.” “I should like,
Sir,” said Mr. BIGGAR, who is always, putting conundrums to the
Chair, “to have your opinion as to whether fe is justified in that
opinion.” This was not quite what Mr. BIGGAR wanted to say; but
.# was at the moment saying what he meant, or doing what he
should, and the appearance of Dr. CoMMINs with evidence of possession
of notes for a speech of an hour or two long, was gladly welcomed as
- Bench and the Table like a hen on a
an opportunity for everyone to go out and reflect upon what we are
coming to.
Business done.—Prepared for another all-night Sitting.
Wednesday.—By kind permission of the SPEAKER, the House
adjourned this morning at § past nine, having sat 41 hours and ſi
minutes. Everyone went home, had a thorough good sleep, a bath,
a canter in the Park, or a walk right to the top of Constitution Hill
winding up by breakfast to the fork. Back again mightily refreshed
at noon, to begin another sitting, which might as well last to Sunday
morning, as there is no use in making more than two bites at a cherry.
This morning we passed the First Reading of the Protection Bill. This
afternoon we were to have passed the Second Reading, but the Irish
Members objected, and the afternoon agreeably wore away with dis-
cussion on motions for adjournment. As I left the House, the last
thing I saw was Mr. BIGGAR and Mr. FINIGAN, after evicting ex-
Ministers from the Front Opposition Bench, in possession of their
holding, and with a nice impartiality objecting to everything;
Everyone says to everyone else, that we had a great triumph, and
§§ Obstruction this morning. Certainly this has some look of
e Klilol.
Business done.-Leave given to introduce Protection of Persons and
Property (Ireland) Bill.
Thursday Night.—Gulliver has awakened, and Lilliput lies low.
What happened yesterday morning turns out to have been merely a
restless movement of the half-
sleeping giant. Now he has moved
in g earnest. It was a fine
dramatic scene. It opened admir-
ably. A few introductory remarks
from Mr. PARNELL; then Mr. DIL-
LoN suddenly discovered º
with folded arms, dark browed an
defiant. Mr. DILLON's action was
a stroke of original genius. The
House of Commons, after long ex-
erience, has thought what it should
§. with various kinds of Obstruc-
tion; but it never occurred to it
that some day would be presented
to it for solution the difficulty of an
Hon. Member standing silent and
motionless, with folded arms, as if
he were having his photograph
taken. Poor Mr. GLADSTONE was
º between the Treasury
ot gridiron. Beckoned forward
by the SPEAKER, pulled back by the Homº SECRETARY, cheered ºn
'..." Ministerialists, howled down by the Home-Rulers, and all the
while fixed upon him the basilisk eyes of this silent man with folded
arms. The PREMIER had an º: bad quarter of an hour.
John DILLON disposed of, Mr. PARNELL popped up, and insisted
upon being made a martyr of. The House hastened to oblige him,
and the unfortunate PREMIER had once more commenced his speech
when Mr. FINIGAN came forward and claimed attention. The
SPEAKER was now warming to his work. Mr. GLADstone had per-
manently got possession of the slip of paper on which were written
the terms of the Suspensory, Order, and Mr. FINIGAN was worke
ºn a twinkling. But if they were in a hurry, Mr. FINIGAN was
Ilot.
“Mr. SPEAKER,” he said, “I ree-spectfully dee-cline to dee-part
except in o-bedience to su-perior force.” -
Nothing could be refused to a Gentleman so syllabic in his into-
nation. Superior force was forthcoming in large quantities—as
many as six of the oldest and most infirm attendants of the House
marching in with pale faces and trembling knees. But Mr. FINIGAN
was not particular to a few score years, He gracefully surrendered
his sword and ree-tired. Then the fun grew fast and furious. At one
sweep of the net twenty-eight Obstructionists were caught. It was
here the piece began to drag, and here where a judicious ºf
down might be effected. Each man was suspended separately. Eac
declined to go, speaking a few lines with more or less effect, and to
each severally and º the Sergeant-at-Arms addressed him-
self, sometimes with his merry men and sometimes without. It got
a trifle wearisome when the twentieth man had played his part,
and by the time the twenty-eighth was reached, one began to feel as
if he were dining exclusively off pickles. But at last #. were all
gone, and then the House of Commons for the first time for many
yº; ºly and †. settled down to its work.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER,
ove change? not as a rule I
doesn't ; but I begins to
think as sumthink might
be done to make our Sun-
days in London just a leetle
more cheerful. Of course
I don't mean nun of your
Continenshal wickedness
as I 've heard spoke of
§ sumtimes, such as Horse
- Racing and Theayters; no
N. no, nothink of that dredful
sort; but I sertenly do wish
as our Sundays wasn’t quite
so dredful dull as they are.
Now here am I and my two
boys, of course we’ve no
professhunal engagements
on that day, and what on
airth to do with ourselves
we don't know. If it appens
# to be fºne, of course, after
£ church, we goes for a walk,
but it seems every year that
we has to go further and
further to get into the
country, and, as everybody
knows, about three times
out of four the wether's
somethink howdacious.
Then what are we to do?
There ain't no Libery open
or we should go there an
look at sum picter books. There's one great book, that I myself am
rayther fond of looking, at called Wanity Fare, that has picturs of
all our Publick men, j makes 'em all look like ideots, or Lunertics,
or Monkeys, drawn by a Gent of the name of Ape. I’m not werry
ansum myself, and that book's a grate comfort to me. I wunder
some werry ill-natured feller don't try a simelar book of our beautiful
Ladies, for all the plane women would be sure to buy it.
WILLIAM is rather fond of Wunderful Historys, such as Gulliver's
Travels, Baron Munchausen, STANLEY's Livingstone, and the Rabian
Rnights, and some of the things as he reads in them and tells us of
arterwards, are real staggerers. My Missus acshally says, as she
don't believe half on 'em ; but then, unfortnitly, her eddicashun
was a good deal niglected.
I, shouldn't think myself, it could well be eonsidered a kind of
wicked deborchery to go to the British Museum and see all the wun-
derful things there; but no, it's all shut up, and so is the Nashunal
Gallery with all its beautiful picters. To be sure there's plenty of Cit
Churches open in the arternoon, but they don't seem much used.
For instance, me and WILLIAM went into a nice little Church in
Cheapside one Sunday, and there was only one person besides us, and
she was only a old woman: The service was one of the regular old
sort, with the Clerk in a little box all to himself, to say Amen, and
after it was over, he came to me, and he said, if we werry much
wished it, the Wicar would preach us a sermon, but there was a
capital precher over the way, and should we mind going there. So
up we got and went out, and didn't trouble the capital precher over
e way.
Well, as we was a going home, who should come dashing º
but the Lord Mare in his butiful Carridge with his 2 Footmen, an
the Sheriffs in their, butiful Carridge with their footmen, and a
Bishup in his butiful Carridge with his footmen, and the hunder
Sheriffs and lots of Common Councilmen and Churchwardens, all
going off to the Manshun House to Lunch
“Hullo,” says WILLIAM, “this seems a rum go.! We can't go to
a Libery or a Museum or a Picter Gallery because we’re told it
would make people work on Sunday, but how about the Coachmun
and the Footmun, and the Cook and all the rest on 'em at the Man-
shun House Luncheon.' Ah,” says he, “this is a rum sort of world,
º, and must take a chap a jolly long time afore he understands
lt all.
We took a long walk after this, and being preshus thirsty we
wanted summat to drink, but no fºublic House was open 'cause it was
. the law. , We met a very respectable Policeman and asked him
what we should do, and he said with a smile, you ought to belong to
a Club, and then you can have anythink you likes, at any time
that's Club Law; or, says WILLIAM, you ought to be a Bishop, an
lunch with the Lord Mare.
Bobby was a wery intelligent man, and told us that some of the
Chemists in the neighbourhood made up prescripshuns for thirst
soles that very few people would know from Brandy and Water, an
º
E.
º
all we had to do was to ring the bell and ask 'em to make up Dr.
WALKER's prescripshun for preventing of English Collery ! As I
don't want to get noboddy into trouble, I says no more, except this,
that where there's a will there's ginerally someboddy over the way.
I was having a chat the other day with a poor forren Waiter who
had bin dismist from a West end house because he wouldn't ay a
lot of fines for the most trifleing things. For instance, fancy fining
a poor Waiter 2s. 6d. for helping hisself to the wing of a foul, and
1s, for agreeing with a Kustomer that the fish wasn't so fresh as the
butter, and 6d. for reading Punch, and 6d. for larfing at it, and
2s. 6d, for smoking, and this in a land of freedom! He assures me
it’s all fax, and; his fines cum to 31s. in a fortnite, and as he
wouldn't pay he was sacked. Well, we was a talkin about Sundays,
and to show what a strange sort of chap he is, he acshually said that
he thort a man showed as much th ess and gratitood by
looking appy and injoying hisself, as he does by looking miserable
and being as miserable as he looks, p'raps more, but of course he's
only a ignorant Frenchman | Why, he once went so far as to say
that º ought to make us cheerfuller and appier. Ah, I
wunder if he's ever been to Glasgow !
I remember werry well when I was fust married, I was engaged
at the Wite Art at W. and many a time have I took my Missus
on my arm and gone and prommenarded on the Slopes on a Sunday
Arternoon, while a fine Milingtery Band played lots of jolly toones
for our emusement.
I also knows I can see plenty of
Court, but Ampton's a long ways off, and Winser's longer, and I
wants my rashernal emusement here, in London. If it's all wrong,
it must be wrong everywheres. If it's all right, why make it so

AT LAST!
AFTER a month of Donnybrook Fair, miscalled an early sitting of
Parliament, the Ministers responsible for the government of England
have cleared the House of the Irish Obstructionists, miscalled
Members of Parliament, and have re-arrested the convict DAVITT
who . never to have been let loose from prison. The cause of
this sudden outburst of .# is not far to seek. As long as Irish
landlords only were cowardly murdered from behind hedges, and
fandangoes were danced in their blood; as long as Irish ladies only were
assaulted by cowardly, ruffians, who fled before a horsewhip; as lon
as Irish households only were threatened with a state of siege, an
only full-blooded, generous, honest Irishmen, pretended they were
not able to pay their just debts, because they were frightened by a
secret band of nameless scoundrels, the English Ministers, comfort-
ably seated at home, or snoring on the well-stuffed benches of the
House of Commons, were content to do nothing but respect the rules
of “Parliamentary practice.” The moment the agitation came
nearer home, when English tenants found it was easy to repudiate
the payment of rent, and a few anonymous writers of Fenian
menaces caused the military in and round London to be confined to
barracks, and the fire-brigade to be in a ferment of expectation, the
situation was changed, and the necessity of action was apparent, even
to the meanest Government capacity.
The Cockney mind is still a force in Imperial politics.

WHISTLER’s WENICE; OR, PASTELS BY
PASTELTHWAITE.
MR.WHISTLER is the artful Doger of Venice...TURNER made
“studies” from which he subsequently developed his pictures: but
Mr. WHISTLER is the “Chiel amang, ye taking notes”—in colour,
and, unable to keep them to himself, he exhibits them in the most
enerous and *::#. way to the ºl. generally. It is very
tind of him; perhaps it is very deep of him, Does he want to dis-
courage his brother artists from § { to Venice? He may have
conceived a violent animosity to Mr. Cook, and has hit upon this
*: ºf deterring intending tourists from visiting the “Pride of
the Sea.
Whatever the motive for the exhibition, the artist seems to speak
for himself, and say—“Well, Sir, I'm Master JIMMY WHISTLER I
am, and if I can do this sort o' thing with a shilling box o' paints
from the Lowther Arcade, a few sheets of blotting paper, and some
brown-paper covers off the family jam-pots, I could do bigger work
with improved materials, you bet!”
This address evidently conveys the suggestion that he should be
forthwith presented by his friends and ºff. with a real colour-
box and the entire artistic paraphernalia. In furtherance of this
design, we place before our readers our own “Notes” in black and
white, suggested by those of Master WHISTLER,

After the late hard frosts, with

quite easy to build houses which

NO PIPES FOR PAUPERS 1
THE proverb untruly declares Virtue to be its own reward. On
the contrary, in so far as Virtue is arduous and painful, it is its own
punishment. Vice is its own reward indeed, when pleasurable,
which makes it so common; Virtue not only punishes itself, but
is also liable to be punished. See, in the subjoined police case, what
an exemplary parochial officer got by a virtuous excess of duty:-
“A decision of some importance to paupers and workhouse authorities has
just been given by the Stipendiary Magistrate at Leeds. An old pauper, by
name HALEY, in the Leeds workhouse, was lately detected by the taskmaster
in the act of smoking, and being taken before the workhouse master was
ordered to be imprisoned in the cell where tramps break stones. HALEY had
to be forced into the cell by the taskmaster, who, he alleged, hurt his head by
thumping it against the wall, and his friends therefore summoned the task-
master for assault. The Magistrate decided that no more violence was used
than necessary to get HALEY into the cell, but questioned the right of the
workhouse master, even when backed up by the guardians, to deprive a pauper
of his liberty. In defence it was urged that the master had the right under
the provisions of the Act 55 Geo. III., cap. 157, see. 5. The Magistrate,
however, said that neither that nor any other Act empowered a workhouse
master, to imprison a pauper, and accordingly fined the defendant 40s, and
costs.”
Thus was an official philanthropist, fined, for a slight over-
exertion of true benevolence; a benevolence during the late incle-
ment weather peculiarly seasonable. And so Virtue was punished.
Benevolence is a virtue vulgarly much mistaken. It does not
consist in merely giving. There is a Positive Benevolence, which
ives, and a Negative Benevolence which denies. The latter
is the Benevolence with which Political Economy requires Paupers
to be treated, for the good of others—the Ratepayers, and for a
warning also to others on the other hand-the labouring classes.
Therefore, the Poor Law forbids pipes to, Paupers, old or, young.
Tobacco is an anaesthetic. The narcotic influence of a #. blunts a
pauper's sense of his situation, and alleviates the discomfort to

Citizen (who had been dining with his “Company”). “HERE, CABMA', LE' ME DRIVE –I'LL ULD'TAKE to MAKE HIM Go ?"
Cabby. “No, No, SIR-Not If I KNow it !
I)'You wa NT TO GET Us BOTH “WAREHOUSED ' ' ' "
BEAUTY NOT AT HOME.
A Back-Street Ballad, dedicated to the Kyrle Society.
THE ceiling was cracked, and the walls were bare,
There was mud on the floor, there was ice on the bed;
For “the tide had been in,” and, in piteous scare,
The mother and bairns from their “home” had all fled."
And he stood, midst the wreck of his flooded-out dwelling, -
'Twas fourteen feet square and three feet underground,
And few cellars more dirty or evilly smelling
In London, the dull and unlovely, are found.
He was only a labourer, brawny and coarse, -
He’d been trying to sweep out the slime from his floor,
And perhaps 'twas the damp that had made him so hoarse;
But a º person who peeped at the door,
And who looked like an angel who’d folded his wings. -
Under broadcloth, lisped forth, “Now this really might give
A suggestion to those who love Beautiful Things.
How—how can our dear poorer brethren—a-live
I.ives so unaesthetic, so shorn of True Beauty P
Now here is a capital opening for them,
Who-like our Society—hold it their duty
To bring Beauty home to the People.—Ahem '''
The labourer lifted his head at the grunt—
For a Kyrle'd darling's cough 'tis perhaps a coarse term—
And exclaimed, “Wot's your game P”—these low men are so blunt—
“Here ain't nothink to temptyer, onless yer a worm.
If yer Partial to mud, like a wriggler, all right;
You'll find lots on it here. I don't like it myself.
I would say “Take a seat,” as is only perlite,
But yer can't axe a gemman to sit on a shelf.”
Then the Kyrle man stepped in; all a-tiptoe, and stood
With a crook in his neck, and a kink in his waist,
And he said, “My poor friend, I would fain do you good.
I’m a humble apostle of Cultchaw and Taste.”
“Wot's them?” asked the labourer—“Summnt to eat?
Or likely, this weather, to keep out the cold P”
Said his visitor, “Ah!”. They give Light, they are Sweet!”
“Oh! like fires and rum with, if I may be so bold,”
Said that fustian-clad Philistine; “don’t sound arf bad.
Why, I took yer for one o' the kind I cuts short,
Meaning Tracks!” Sighed the Kyrle Man, “This really is sad
What would PostLETH waſTE make of a scene of this sort?”
Then aloud, “Friend, the worst of this terrible scene
Is its uttah unloveliness. Beauty's a boon
That makes even the desert of Poverty green.
Now a dado, you see, or a simple-sweet toon,
Were it only ‘Bo-Peep’ on a comb, don't you know,
At this moment would make all this misery melt
Into raptehaw, and banish this odour, -although
I must own 'tis the nastiest ever I smelt.
Take a sniff at this Lily, or only a look, -
We can lire upon looks, if directed aright. -
I will leave it you, friend, with Miss HILL's little book.
What you want's mural paintings, and Sweetness and Light.
Lilies would not grow here, though there's plenty of mud,
And for frescoes your walls, I admit, are scarce fit;
But just think of the Beautiful, not of that flood,
And you'll grow quite resigned to things—after a bit.
Has your wife, now, a good Peacock's feather? What, no?
Oh, there's comfort untold in a fine Peacock's feather
'Twill make her forget the high tide, the deep snow,
And the wreck of her home, and the state of the weather;
Believe me —” But here, from a sound that ensued,
The Muse very much fears that Kyrle man got kicked out.
Were the poor not such Philistines, boorish, and rude,
He’d have done, oh! a great deal of good there—no doubt!
PARLIAMENTARY LEGACY. —We have heard a great deal lately of
“The Will of the House.” Is Parliament moribund? If it in
its legal advisers and makes its will, it will, of course, leave every-
thing to the SPEAKER. The “Will” of the House, however, just
now seems to be WILLIAM GLADSTONE.

(A Page from the Diary of a British Officer in the Transvaal.)
Monday.—Received instructions to “treat prisoners with courtesy,
but not to afford' them the rights of belligerents.” What on earth
does this mean? Looked up the Queen's Regulations and the
Articles of War. Can't find anything to meet the case. Seems to
me that a fellow must be either a rebel or an enemy. Powder and

Tuesday.—Everything going on all .# Playful skirmish with

never was at answering conundrums? Fortunately they rode
away before we got up to them. In consequence, no prisoners on
either side. Had another turn at the authorities, and went to sleep
over them. Write this before turning in. All right up to now.
Wednesday.—As I expected In for it ! Just before ending an
uneventful, and consequently cheerful day, a prisoner was taken by
an over-officious colour-sergeant Should like to break the fellow
for his folly, only I suppose it was his duty'. Nice mess though
What am I to do now? Decided not to see the prisoner to-night.
He will keep—or rather, we shall have to keep him—until to-morrow
morning. -
Thursday.—The prisoner was brought before me. Not half a bad
fellow. He had strayed into our lines by mistake—wish he had
made another mistake, and had strayed out again He speaks
English fluently, and appreciates my jeu de mots about “ at a
Boer'." He has read all the London papers. He knows my instrug-

he says, “Not at all—to oblige me.” Apologised to him, but ex-

the spirit of the thing by picking some oakum. He says that he
believes “that is the H. penal servitude form.” “With some rope
and an old pair of kid-gloves,” he says “he will be quite the cheer-

believe me! Let us see how we stand. We have got 20,000 men at Samarkand
as “a base of operations against India.” Been there since April, and want to
be on the move. KAUFMANN (sharp fellow, KAUFMANN') celebrated the open-
ing day of the Conference destined to “cement the eternal friendship between
England, and Russia,” by giving SHERE AL1. a draft treaty in my name, pro-
mising him every kind of support against the English!. We are to protect him

to get on with the affair as quickly as possible. Latest news from London—
BRITANNIA (bless her 1) still fast asleep!

to him and to Afghanistan.” To prove this, I added, “that I would do what-
ºver-I thought necessary!” Nice vague *g this, which tickled Sto.Tºteff
(who has a keen sense for humour) immensely. Suggested that he (StoreſterF)
should say that “our Government was as wise as a serpent, and as harmless as a
love”. Sroºrººf delighted. Thinks it the most beautiful poetry he ever
hard in his life! So it is! Gave him some more hints for his letter to the
“Eternal friendship
Ameer. Poor ALI, to be advised to foregather with the
SULTAN, and “to look to his brothers over the river.”
Request also to be made to him to tell plenty of lies, “to
perplex the enemy's mind, and give up his intention of
fighting him.” Stolnetºff read over the draft, and said,
“that with a little blasphemy—which always pleases the
Af s—it would do very nicely.” News from London
—BRITANNIAasleep, but with one eye open. Send all sorts
of friendly assurances. Result. BRITANNLA snoring !
December 1st.—SHERE ALI becoming a bore Says he
is getting the worst of it, and wants me (of all persons
in the world !) to help him! Never heard of such a
thing! Have ordered KAUFMANN (rather a donkey,
Kaufmann ) to tell him we can't be bothered with
him during the winter. Still, if he likes to keep alive
until thes , we will see what those 20,000 men at
Samarkand can do for him. In the meanwhile–Russia
and England were never better friends!
December 10th.-Really SHERE ALI is becoming an
intolerable nuisance! Stoiretºff (injudicious sort of
fellow, Stoll ETEFF I) followed me all the way to Livadia
from Aſºº with despatches! Of course the idea
of upsetting BRITANNIA is an excellent notion. No doubt
about that—must be done as soon as may be But
SHERE ALI is played out. However, sent love to him
through Stoireterf (persistent fellow, Stoiretºff (), and
authorised him to say, distinctly, “that, after the cold
season was over, the Russian &ºt would come
to his assistance.” Recommended the usual amount
of lying, with hints about the intervention of the SULTAN,
and a Congress at St. Petersburg. This to be sent to

AFTER THE SCARE.
(Auctioneering Intelligence in advance.—April 1.)
THE series of efficient precautionary measures taken by the
authorities, in the earlier part of the session, having, as might have
been expected, rendered the execution of any single one of the many
daring schemes of outrage, then in contemplation, not only difficult,
but º a very large stock of “explosives” has been
ually accumulating in the market. Whether, however, it be
ue to the fact that buyers seem shy at anything like remunerative
prices, or there happens to be, just now, a glut of this class of goods,
the demand for them has been far from brisk. Recourse, therefore,
has been had to the hammer; and yesterday, the crowded condition
of Messrs RUTTIck & STIMPsox's rooms, where the lots of a very
interesting catalogue were taken in succession, testified to the wisdom
of the experiment.
After several tons of hand-grenades, six-chambered revolvers,
spring knives, loose powder, and other purely defensive material,
had (owing to extensive commissions to purchase, from inhabitants of
the Cromwell Road), been disposed of with some remarkably lively
bidding, a few of the more important lots were put on to the table.
Among these perhaps the most noticeable was (91). “Two
dozen self-motor mechanical infernal machines ; each warranted,
singly, to blow up a public building twice as large as St. Paul's,
neatly and efficiently, with or without warning.”
Several of these ingenious and excellent articles, all bearing the
name of a highly respectable American firm, were handed about for
inspection, and a lively contest ensued; a nobleman well-known in
society for his hearty devotion to practical joking, materially raising
the figure. The lot, however, was eventually knocked down to the
President of a South American Republic, amid a round of applause,
for £416s.
The following leading lots were then put up, in their turn, and
disposed of severally as under:-
119. Self-propelling Land Torpedo : warranted, when set, to
burrow, straight through any thickness of stone wall, and explode as
per indicator. Purchased by the Channel Tunnel Co. (£1 2s. 6d.)
135. Steel Revolver-proof Shirt. ... Leggings and Back-board to
match. The “Anti-Assassin's Suit,” as advertised. Captain Gos-
sETT. (£15 15s.)
174. Tin Canister, drilled top; whipcord, cog-wheels, and charge
of powder complete. A most serviceable machine. This fell to
Mr. Lapoucheſſe (purchased by him for presentation to the Fleet
Street Clearance Committee), and went, after a spirited contest,
amidst several rounds of ...)". for 13s. 4d. - - -
207. A Bag of damaged Dynamite, a time fuse (directions loºt),
and a bor of erplosire balls, beautifully packed and readyſº (an
ercellent Christmas present for a Literary and Scientific Institution).
The Greek Government. (£9 9s.
265. Thirty-sir Conspirators' Cloaks, slouched hats. daggers,
dark-lanterns, forms of oath, and gun-cottom pºetianiker. iefs.
All in ercellent condition. Mr. J. L. Tool E. (£1.16s.).
311. A Letter in Cypher (without the key). The Editor of Notes
and Queries. (1s.) -
347. A Subterranean Plan of the House of Commons, showing
eract position of Cellar under Speaker's chair; with wires, battery,
signal, secret passage, and explosive material, com lete. A sensa-
tional lot. The Westminster Aquarium Co. (eið.
Several other interesting articles further on in the list occasioned
eager competition; but the excitement culminated when the great
feature of the Catalogue (459), “A silent, three months, slºe-
progressing Railway Terminus Shaker” a first-class 1ece of Phila-
delphia work) was put up amidst tremendous, cheering. . The
Auctioneer, in calling attention to this “remarkable lot,” pointed
out that it had been accidentally “set off” somewhere about the
first of January, and that it must therefore be, as he expressed it, ... in
fine condition for purchase” at the present moment. Nºtwithstan
the anxiety of agentleman representing the Turkish Government,
that the bidding should commence without any delay, this announce-
ment created a panic which it became impossible to contrºl, and, by
general consent, the “Slow progressor” had just been taken to the
presiding Magistrate at Bow Street, in order that he might express
}. opinion as to what had better be done with it, when our parcel
went to press.

MovdA y Night, Feb. 7.-Have found a
new humorist." He turned up in the most
unexpected place—on the Tory side, and not
only on the Tory side, but amongst the
Ulster Tories' Name, MACNAGHTEN; county,
Antrim; species, dry.
When Mr. MACNAGHTEN presented himself to the House, no one
for a moment expected the joy of this rare discovery. Everyone
knows it is not the Ulster Custom to make, jokes, nor did Mr. MAC-
NAGHTEN's appearance suggest the possibility of variation from
established usage. Not being personally known to the House, he
was taken for another of those members of the Clergy with whom
Ireland, always odd, has dowered the new Parliament. There was
no reason for this perhaps, except that he looked very grave, spoke
in a solemn voice, and had that disposition to conceal }. shirt-front
which º inseparable from º Orders. Mr. MACNAGHTEN's
jokes will probably not tell very well in paper currency; they are
rather of the kind that require the mint-mark of manner and voice.
Perhaps the greatest joke of all was the uncertainty that prevailed
whether he really knew he was funny, or whether he marvelled why
the House should, from time to time, break into roars of laughter,
No smile played over the visage of the Member for Antrim, nor, in-
deed, was there suggestion of any other emotion. If it had been
the wooden figurehead of a ship set up at the corner seat below the
*gway, there could not have been upon its features less of º flicker to the merriment of the House. The tone and
- *nner of Mr. MacNAGHTEN's delivery are precisely akin to that of a Curate reading his sermon on a sultry Sunday afternoon. There
* | *the slow rise and fall, the nasal intonation, the indrawing of breath in fitful hope of humanity, and the outbreathing in something
like a º: hopeless despair. - -
Yet both the matter and the style were far beyond the average Sunday afternoon sermon in quiet places. Mr. MACNAGHTEN was
g strong common sense, and, as often happens with men so gifted, his thoughts found expression in simple, well-turned

sentences. But the intonation was irresistible, and when having
digressed from quotation he added, “I will now return to the charge
of Mr. Justice FitzGERALD,” the effect was so indescribably comic,
that the House went into paroxysms of laughter, whilst Mr. MAC-
NAGHTEN stood waiting an opportunit to continue, looking out
straight before him, as the ship's figurehead stares with unaiterable
regard over the incomprehensible excitement of the sea. -
Business done.—Debate on Second Reading of Protection Bill
resumed and again adjourned.
Tuesday Night.—“You’d better go in, Toby; there's JoE Cow BN
rubbing the House of Commons' back the wrong way.”
It was the kindly voice of Sir CHARLES DILKE that thus addressed
me as 1 was trotting meditatively down the corridor leading to the
library, glad to be away from the flood of
illimitable talk that fills the House in
spite of newly awakened Speakers and
Brand-new rules. I have had my back
rubbed the wrong way myself, and felt
some curiosity to know how the House of
Commons stood the operation. I must say
it got through it very ill. Here was the
gentleman whom everyone calls “Joe,”
standing on the floor º the House, pour-
ing forth a flood of picturesque and occa-
sionally biting eloquence. JoE was, to
use a phrase familiar in the Gargery
household, “on the rampage.” As he
admitted, he felt strongly on the question
of the Coercion Bill, and to do him justice,
he spoke strongly. It was real eloquence,
unpurchaseable—by the lesser sort un-
attainable. Nascitur non fit. The orator
had no notes, not even the little º:
aper that Mr. GLADSTONE and Mr.
RIGHT bring to the table with them on
great occasions. In a continuous uninter-
rupted unhesitating stream poured forth
the lava of his burning indignation, of
his heated sympathy, and his by no means unutterable scorn;
It was a difficult task, requiring a dauntless spirit, to stand on the
floor of the House of Commons and utter this unpalatable speech.
Nor did the peculiar reception of it make the task easier. At
some men the House would have roared; , and I can fancy that
a born orator having a brave heart would delight in such a storm.
But to-night there was something worse than this—a chilling silence
broken only by the cheers from the Irish benches that anyone can
buy with a phrase. . In times past JoE has spoken amid this angered
silence on his own side of the House whilst the rafters have rung to
the acclamations of the jº whom, apart from foreign policy, all
his life has been devoted to thwarting, and who
owe to his genius, his tireless energy, and his
lavish devotion of i.". the memorable defeat
they suffered in the North of England in the
Election of '68, , . But now even these voices
were silent, and his old friends of the Beacons-
field-and-Glory era stared straight before them
with an unmistakably “Don't know you’” air.
Only on the Treasury Bench was this stony
silence broken, this º of muscle
varied. When Joe rose, Mr. GLApstone, with
a foreknowledge of what was coming, lay back
in his seat, closed his eyes, and put on a pretty
affectation of slumber. But the mask fell off
after a few uneasy, and from the first hopeless,
attempts to retain it., Presently the PREMIER
was sitting bolt upright, with eyes wide ‘.
and a look of Jove-like displeasure on his face.
As JoE thundered along, hitting out right and
left, now bestowing on Mr. BRIGHT a “oner,”

even by the Northumbrian orator. On the whole rather a painful
Scene.
Business done.—None.
Wednesday Afternoon.-Died this afternoon at hº four,
aged four days, the debate on the Second Reading of the Protection
Bill. The happy event might as well have occurred on Monday, or
even on Friday, for all use the extension of its existence has been to
mortal. A spirit of vexation has kept it alive so long, and in dying
it characteristically endeavoured to vex as many people as possible.
What undertakers call “the event” was not expected to take place
until half-past five; but after staggering weakly along, borne down
under the innumerable weight of words, the debate #j down
and quietly breathed its last an hour before the appointed time.
The consequence was great consternation in the Lobby. No one
would stay in the House who could possibly be out of it whilst the
poor weakling was puling and moaning to its inevitable end. The
more prudent or less busy remained in the precincts of the House,
and when the bell rung were in time to vote. But fifty or sixty
gentlemen, “something in the City” or elsewhere, timed their
movements so as to be back at five o'clock, and were just privileged
to see their colleagues streaming into the Lobby, having recorded
their votes.
I am told that any inanition in the debate inside the House was
compensated for by the vigorous lan i. used by these Peri shut
out from the paradise of the fº y.
Business done.—Second Reading of Protection Bill carried by 359
votes against 56.
Thursday Night.—One of those nights which appreciably shorten
life by the wear and tear of conflicting emotions. Not since Mr.
CHAPLIN made his memorable and melancholy speech have I been
so deeply touched or felt, the great deprivation, involved in the
injunction of the Sergeant-at-Arms against indulgence in an occa-
sional howl.
First of all there was the case of the Irish Members, about whom
somebody has been saying something in print,
It is quite natural that gentlemen like Mr. --
ARTHUR O'Connoh and his countrymen who sit ſ. *A
below the gangway should resent personal attacks, ** 6
and should have no hesitation in sheltering them- TAº Aº
selves behind the avenging rules of the House of º 'º
Commons. They themselves are so punctilious in
the matter of not imputing motives, so polite in
their manner, so courteous in their speech, that
one hears not without a thrill of indignation that
some one has been attacking them, Moreover
their distress is more real and more deeply seated
than mere sentiment. It appears that some one
has been saying that they receive fifteen guineas
a week from the Land League, whereas they
don't. Mr. O'ConnoR's plaintive manner in
making this contradiction must have moved the
hardest heart to pity. Mr. PARNELL is unfor-
tunately away just now, no one exactly knows
where. If he comes back again I think I will
drop a word in his ear. If I could only conve

MR. BROADHURST
r. O'Connor declared that the statement was —THE FREE
not true, or one-fifth of the indignation with which AND ACCEPTEP
Mr. McCoAN co the denial, something MASON:
*f; be done. ...
This was one thing that touched a heart naturally tender. But I
was quite broken down when some hours later Mr. WARTON rose and
§ a tear, over the practically accomplished extinction ºf the
Chiefships, and the proximate Abolition of the Monarchy. Whilst
Mr. Fowleh was shouting, I fancied. I heard a peculiar snuffling
from the back bench behind ex-Ministers. I thought it was only
Mr. WARToN taking snuff; but it seems he was struggling º:
his emotion. He was “touched,” he tells us, “aye, deeply touched;
and though the effect of contact does not appear to have operated in
the direction of adding coherency to his ideas, the emotion dºes
credit to his heart. e House was touched too, but it was under
the fifth rib, and it º: as immoderately as if Mr. WARTON,
instead of struggling with his emotion, had been physically tickling
it. Mr. GLADstoNE, who has been in better spirits to-night than for
the last fortnight past, laughed immoderately as this bulwark of the
British Constitution, snuff-box in hand, and parti-coloured pocket-
handkerchief in reserve, lamented the passing away of old things,
and the Americanisin ğ the Law Courts by the introduction of such
titles as President and Vice-President.
No one quite knew what it all meant; but it was a pleasant change
after the thunder, and lightning of Mr. Wolverhampton Fowº,
who pleaded for the preservation of “the picturesque peculiarities'
of the Chiefships with all the fervour of diction and gesture that are
so useful in moving a jury to a verdict in a breach .# romise case:
Business done.--House went into Committee on Protection Bill.
Abolition of Chiefships agreed to by 178 votes against 110,

Mr. HEALY has taken to his heels, we are not getting on so well as
might have been expected in Committee on the Protection Bill,
There has been a great deal done in the way of protestation and
very little in the way of Amendments. After two nights' work we

that is, from Aldgate, in the East, to Newgate, in the West.

O. C. Do they reside?

C. We have a Rector, three Churchwardens, three Overseers, one
Poor Law Guardian, a Vestry Clerk, an Organist, an Organblower, a
Sexton, a Beadle, and two Pew Openers.
0, C. What an establishmentſ Is your church well attended ?
C. Pretty well.
Q. C. What may be the average number 2
C. About twelve.
0, C. That's less than the number of officials. Have you many poor?
C. When the City was divided into several Unions, we used to
keep a couple of Paupers, to prevent our being united to some poor
parish, but now that there is but one Union we do not find it necessary.
O ave you any Parochial Funds P
% 9h yes, certainly. We have about £1000 a year. .

Some portion we devote towards payment of the Poor Rate.
C. Whose pocket does that save
Well, of course, it reduces the charge to the Rate Payers, but
we really don't know what else to do with it.
Q. C. Continue, Sir. -
Ç. It has been the custom from time immemorial to serve wine
and light refreshments at all meetings of Westries and of Parish
Officers, and once a year, sometimes oftener, we º: a Parish Dinner
at the Crystal Palace or Greenwich, paid for out of these funds,
which we find very conducive to good will and harmony: occasion-
ally too we visit our Parish Estates to see that they are in good condi-
tion, and, the Carriages and then Banquet come to a considerable sum.
0, C. Anything er of the same kind? - -
Ç. Yes. At certain periods we perambulate the Parish, what is
technically called, “beating the bounds,” and on those occasions our
bºurs are rewarded by a banquet at Greenwich or Richmond;.
O. C. Is the income that you administer in so very extraordinary
a manner increasing or diminishing : -
C, Oh, increasing very rapidly. When an old lease falls in the
rental is increased at least four-fold.
. C. Have you any accumulation? -
'. Oh yes, to a very considerable amount. In fact we find it
extremely difficult to dispose of our present, income; and what we
shall dowith it a few years hence, when it will be largely increased, I
cannot form an idea,

difficulty,

fiscation. We do our bºtunder very difficult circumstances to spend
the income provided by our Pious Ancestors, and if we fail, it is
Cause we are beaten by circumstances beyond our control.
Q. C. How do you mean? - -
C. We have money to expend for bread, but no recipients; we have
money for apprenticing, but no Apprentices; we have gifts for the
Poor, but no Poor to receive them. "What can we do? -
0.C. It seems to me that the money that should be º in Bread

that the money that should relieve the Poor, is * to relieve

apprenticing Poor boys, is expended shamefully, wastefully, extra-
Yagantly, and uselessly. And I can only express a hope that when

gits no satisfac-

and is never paid
for the valuable

he should have been earning his living. Even when the Beak con-
victs, he only makes the defendant pay the amount claimed, the
cost of the summons, and one-and-sixpence for Cabby's loss of time.
Isn't that a genuine grievance, now *
And here’s another thing as happened to me once which helped to
make me lose my faith in human nature. Oh! The dirty, paltry,
disreputable things as mean low miscreants are capable of ! W. i.
you #. of a respectable-looking chap laying snares to steal my
twopenny halfpenny traps?, This is how it was. A genteel-looking
person engaged me one evening and ordered me about from place to
place and gave me a cigar, as many of 'em will, to put you
off the scent and make you cheerful, and asked after the Missus
and the family, and said as how he had little 'uns of his own,
till I was quite took in by his blarney. Well! We got on as
jolly as sandboys, had a glass here and a glass there until I
felt that if I didn't look out I should appear before the Beak, not
of my own accord, and git my licence endorsed.
So says I, “Look here, old chap. It’s yely kind of you, and
I’m much obliged by your hospitality, but I’d rayther have no
more. Give me a extra bob to take home.” “Just one more,”
says he in his deluthering way, “a stirrup-cup, and then you'll
drive me home and I'll pay you.” So I guided down that last
glass to his jolly goºd health, which tasted a bit queer and didn't
seem, somehow, to fit comfortably into the inside, and started off.
It was pitch dark, by this time, and I did feel uncommon queer to
be sure. I was all of a perspiration, tho' it wasn't hot. e road
was a waving up and down, and the lamps was making faces, and
poussetting one to the other and º and bowing and whirling
round and round and in and Qut till I felt as if I was bewitched.
But I set my teeth and knitted my brows in hopes as the fresh air
would bring me round, and took a tº: grip of the reins, which
seemed to be slipping away from me—but it was all to no purpose.
The fare inside seemed to be hollowing out and saying somethin
but I couldn't hear distinctly what, for the singing in my ears. A
at once the road gave a º .."; and the cab a great lurch, and
all the lamps came in a §§ and banged me in the eye, and water
rushed up into my head till I was all wet and drowning, and blessed
if I could remember any more.
When I came to, it was the º morning, and I was sittin
t
inside the cab with a friend ba my temples. “What cheer?
he says, ...ink “I’ve had a job to prevent your being collared

he says, “where you ought to be.” “Where's my fare?” I says,
ºf to remember a bit what had passed. “And where's my
rugs, and my mat; and where's my old overcoat, and my money—
oh murder—where’s my silver watch and chain, as father gave me
on his death-bed ?” I saw it all, and so did my old pal, who looked
grave. That heartless well-dressed scamp had stooped to drug a
wretched cabman's beer in order to rob him of the few poor trifles he
possessed! Respectfully Yours, -

LAST Thursday the following information from Constantinople
appeared in the Times:–
“A great deal of interest and speculation has been created here by a rhmour
that the SULTAN has received from the German Emperor an autograph letter
containing some advice about the Greek question. The rumour has very little
solid foundation. The SULTAN has, indeed, received from Berlin a letter
signed by the Emperor WILLIAM, but it had nothing to do with politics, and
was simply a formal expression of thanks for a musical composition by the
Sultan's pianist, which His Majesty had sent to the Emperor by Count
HATzFELDT.”
We here give the Emperor's reply—verbatim, of course:—
CHER PoRTE,-Comment rous Portez-vous *, Thanks for your
ianist's composition, which is better than anything in the way of
#. Notes I’ve ever seen. I'm not much of a hand at the piano
myself, but, as far as one finger goes, I can back myself against any-
body—including BISMARCK, who has practised with one finger in
every pi-ano for years, while I’ve ºnly done it on a limited scale.
I see it's written in the key of “G”—(you’re expecting GoscHEN
every day, eh?)—which is a valuable one, as it keeps one sharp, and
has no other accidentals. Love to the Harem-scarem generally.
Yours harmoniously, SWEET WILLIAM.

“THE COLONEL" IN A NUT-SHELL.
A Philistine and Maudle visit the Prince of Wales's.
I WENT to see The Colonel at the Prince of Wales's, and I took
MAUDLE with me. I had some trouble in persuading him to accom-
pany me, for at first he flatly
refused to go to any theatre but
the Lyceum, but at last he con-
sented. Then another difficulty
arose, should he take his lily
with him. I had heard some-
thing about the play, so I said
decidedly not, and consoling
himself with the reflection that
the night air might not agree
with the “precious” thing, and
bidding it an affectionate adieu,
we departed for Tottenham
Street.
Here is the story of the §§
A Mr. , Forrester, physically
strong, but morally weak, is
married to a charming wife.
But, unhappily, that lady, under
the guidance of her mother,
Lady Tompkins, has fallen a
victim to . Aestheticism. So
- Forrester's house is decorated
according to the prevailing, mania, with hangings in “art-colours.”
and sunflowers, plates and pottery, and mediæval furniture; his
wife and mother-in-law appear as
“arrangements” in brick-red and
§age-green, and even attire his poor
little sister in peacock-blue, while
they religiously endeavour to live up
to their hawthorn china. And that
is not all. The presidingÅ. of
the house is a Professor of Æsthetics,
a certain Lambert Streyke, who is, to
the eyes of all but his dupes, a
ghastly old humbug; while
with, him is his nephew,
Basil Giorgione, once a
chemist's assistant, but
now a painter. B. G. has
executed a work of art,
which hangs in the place
of honour, and I can only
say it is so deliciously like
the anatomical curiosities
of Mr. BURNE-Jones, that
it. Ought to be secured at
all hazards for the Gros-
Yenor Gallery. This
“Arrangement in Gold”
is, I have heard, the work
of a rising young artist— | |
Mr. PADGETT—not an
£sthete. When we saw all
s on the stage MAUDLE -
was delighted; he echoed the language of the *. declared it was
“quite too utter,” and regretted he had not brought his lily.
Meanwhile, we saw
poor Forrester's
misery, when, to his
eat joy, in comes
is oldfriend, Colonel
jºi, of the Ús.
Cavalry, and this
gentleman at once
sees how the land
lies, sums up Mr.
Streyke in an instant,
and determines to
save his friend from
this intolerable bond-
age. At first, how-
ever, victory remains
with Mr. Streyke and
his infatuated dis-
ciples, for, while
Forrester is very
- anxious that his
friend should stay with him, Lady Tompkins determines to get rid
of the Philistine, and the obedient wife, though sorely against her
NUTs on THE Colon EL.

will, allows the Colonel to be sent to an hotel. So ends the First
Act in which the tone of aesthetic society is preserved with such
satirical, fidelity that it made me shudder and delighted MAUDLE,
who wildly proposed “two lilies and a split soda,” if that refresh-
ment were attainable: which, happily, was not the case.
In the Second Act we are in a very different atmosphere. Here,
on a fourth floor flat, furnished
with a total disregard for Æsthetic
principles, lives }. Mrs. Blyth,
a gay widow, who wins all hearts,
and with whom we discover that
Mr. Forrester, calling himself
Fisher, is flirting outrageously.
He introduces the Colonel to Mrs.
Blyth, and it turns out they are
old loyers separated through a
misunderstanding; and it was, in-
deed, to seek out the lady that the
American came to Europe. Then
occurs an alarming complication.
Mrs. Forrester arrives to enlist
Mrs. Blyth's co-operation in an
AEsthetic scheme, is followed by
her mother and iſ. Sirº, and
discovers her husband, whom she
had supposed to have started for
the country, and the Act winds up AN OLIVE AND A LITTLE P1cKLE.
on a telling situation.
Third Act. Streyke and his nephew fall out, and we hear of a
bill run up by the º for all sorts of luxuries at a neighbouring
restaurant, while they pretend to live on the contemplation of lilies.
Mrs. Forrester has appealed to the Colonel, who hoists Streyke with
his own petard, opens Lady. Tompkins's eyes, reconciles husband and
wife, is accepted by Mrs. Blyth, arranges an impromptu carpet
dance after the fashion of an American “Surprise,” when the ladies
return to the garments of civilisation, and the play winds up merrily
with the discomfiture of the AEsthete, and the triumph of common
sense.
MAUDLE was, and is, yery angry. He sat in sulky silence until
the end, and then the inextinguishable laughter roused him into
# He said he considered the Author a person of no culture, a
Philistine of the Philistines, wholly destitute of sweetness and light
and of any feeling for what is most precious in Art.

“THE LIGHT FANTASTIC.”
this to MAUDLE, who admits it is a fair account of the piece, but
adds, that he wonders the brain did not curdle within the cranium
of the perpetrator of such an outrage. As he quitted the theatre he
sighed out, “We are not all Impostors.” I at once admitted the
truth of this remark, as certainly MAUDLE ought to know of some
exceptions. Then he glided homewards, and comforted himself
with cold lily and Mr. PATER.
The acting is admirable. Mrs. LEIGH MURRAY and Miss MYRA
Hol.ME, as Lady, Tompkins, and Mrs. Forrester, have caught, the
postures and trick of speech of the School to the life; while Miss
AMY RosFLLE's Mrs. Blyth, and Miss GRAHAME's Weii, Were
bright and pleasant performances. Mr. Cog HLAN's Colonel is a
masterly performance; he shows us an American #. not a
vulgar caricature of a soldier in the U.S. army, and gave every line
with telling effect. Mr. FERNANDFZ greated a Streyke out of his
own inner consciousness, which made MAUDLE wild. . Row LAND
BUCKSTONE was amusing as Basil Giorgione ; while Mr. HERBERT
was a very fresh and manly representative of Mr. Forrester.
Mr. BRUCE SMITH's AEsthetic interiors are of a truth “consum-
mately precious,” and the AEsthetes, on the whole, seemed to have
rather the best of it in dress and decoration. That, indeed, was
MAUDLE's opinion, and I am bound to believe him, though I am only
A PHILISTINE.

COX AND BOX AT BERLIN,
HERR voN BENNIGSEN and Herr
von LUDwig, Members of the
Prussian Parliament, quarrelled.
So Herr von BENNIGse N imme-
diately took the part of Cor,
while Herr von LUDwig chose
that of Bor. In MADDIson MoR-
ToN's immortal farce this bit of
dialogue will be remembered:-
Von Bennigsen Cor. Can you fight?
Von Ludwig Bor. No.
Von Bennigsen Cor. Then come on!
But Von Ludwig Bor would not
come on, “on political grounds,”
which are doubtless more pleasant
to come on than the “ground.”
But, inspired by the success of
his rival, Von Ludwig Boar asked
Von Bennigsen Cor to come on,
who would not, however, “fight
a man who had so lowered him-
self by his conduct.” To Pom
Bennigsen Cor is to be given a
grand dinner. What Von Lud-
wig Bor is to receive we do not
yet know, but we should suggest
a dinner also. And then these
fiery men of the sword might join
together, in the tag of Bombastes
Furioso, slightly adapted from
the English-

Thus to end all sorrow;
And, if some folks please,
We’ll dine again to-morrow.”

RECENT MARVELS OF
SCIENCE.
At the Royal Institution a few
days ago, Professor EDWARD A.
SchAFER, commencing a course of
lectures on “The i. i* delivered
an instructive discourse, in which
he mentioned that a German Pro-
fessor, whom, however, he did
not name, “had found that if the
blood of an animal were removed,
and the blood-vessels filled with
milk, or a weak solution of salt,
the animal continued to live
| without apparent inconvenience.”
Wonderful, if true; for how it
was that when the blood of an
animal had been removed for the
purpose of replacing it with milk
or brine, the animal did not die
from being bled to death before
the brine or the milk could be
injected, requires to be explained;
but if a learned physiologist ascer;
tained the fact, it must be all
right, of course.
n the Second of Professor
Schafer's lectures, “the method
of measuring the diameters of
blood-corpuscles was explain
according to the processes of Mr.
Gulliver and Professor WöL-
cher.” After having pondered
the previous statement about the
substitution of milk or salt-and-
water for blood in a living ani-
mal, it is difficult to suppress the
suggestion that the Christian
name of the former of those two
entlemen of science was, per-
laps, LEMUEL, and that the pro;
cesses in which he co-opera
with the latter were possibly
conducted in a laboratory at La-
puta. Nevertheless, no doubt the
results of their scientific labours
are all right.

THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF BURGLARS.
“That burglary should have grown to the dimensions of a Science, is a
disagreeable feature in modern civilisation.”—Daily Telegraph.
THE Chairman, and President of the Association, Mr. MATTº
ARNoLDSIREs, in opening the proceedings, said that he hoped they
would all make themselves at home. As a matter of fact, they geº-
rally did—(“Hear! Hear!”)—whether in their own. particular
kens—he begged pardon, Clubs,-the pantry of the retired trades-
man—he meant, of course, retired for the night, or the lºſſ
room of the slumbering Peer. (Laughter.) He trusted they wo d
pass the champagne freely—it came, without permission, from the
cellar of a titled connoisseur, and cut away at the Cabañas, of a
brand which some of them would remember having smoke for the
first time during the small hours in the Conservatory of Cumbermore
House. (A laugh.) Burgling had become a Fine Art; its stud
was a branch of the higher education about which we now hºa
so much. Burgling hi now its mechanics, its diplomacy, and its
aesthetics. -
Mr. SMASHEM said he agreed with every blooming word—he
begged pardon, every opinion—which their, Chairman had uttered:
The method of FAgin was as obsolete as flint-locks. Culture and
the revolver were the order of the day, or rather the night:

turnip-headed, old Bogey. Bobbies were as easy to dodge as a blind elephant, and as open
to “squaring” as a Railway Porter. But to nobble a groom, or palaver a pretty housemaid,
required knowledge of human nature, and taking ways.
Mr. JonAs OLDFAKE said he 'umbly begged parding for wenturing to hintrood hisself on
sech a occasion... He knowed jolly well wasn't in it, being j, a unfortnit worn-out
Criberacker of the old school, born afore the days o' Colt's revolvers and Cultcher. But
he was proud to see the purfession a prosperin' and a progressin' in a style as him and his pals
on the old lº, could never have himagined possible. Thanks to Science and the Bobbies—
(“Bless'em")-burglary wos becomin' a easy, safe, hornamental, and 'ighly profitable recrea-
tion. Only wished he was young and leary enough, to have a fresh cut in hisseif. in his
days the risk, was mostly large, and the swag small. Cultcher seemed to 'ave haltered all
that. He wished it luck.
Mr. LARKY, KQVE said that burgling was nearly the only respectable occupation left for a
ntleman who had, a patrician, scorn, of drudgery, and a love for finesse and the fine arts.
emiers were too hard-worked for his taste, and lardy-dardy swells didn't get enough
fun and excitement, Burgling was the
thing, the last of the romantic profes-
sion. To fool; a Peeler was as †:
sport as besting an Ambassador; he’d as
soon flirt with a pretty housemaid as badiner
with a political intrigante, and as to taste
whether artistic or epicurean, who had
better opportunities for indulging it gratis
than the happy housebreaker P Not LU-
CULLUs and JoHN RUSKIN rolled into one !
The wooden impotence of Policedom, and
the utter and helpless funk of the Public
in presence of the new state of affairs,
were simply delicious to the humorous
mind. Oh yes, he'd heard all about that
little put-up job, with the poor Chemist.
It didn't disturb him, not an atom. If the
Peelers amused themselves with tempting
timid pill-quacks into breaking the law,
they'd have still less time even than now
to devote to the bold burglar who made a
business of defying it. Nasty, mean, un-
English game, of course; but it was better
for the Bobbies to be manufacturing what
was called crime, than detecting it.
(“Hear! hear!”
After a vote of thanks to the Chairman,
the Meeting separated, each member going
to somebody else's house in the fashionable
quarter now known as Burglaria.
“NOT FOR JOE ' "
THE crotchety Cowen, who backed up the
urk,
Declares the Coercion Bill never will work;
So he spouted *i. it, a Radical hearty,
And once more deserted the Liberal party.
But “Canny Newcastle” can't quite un-
derstan
The way that he plays his political hand.
Can it be into Office he's trying to dance?—
For that's often the aim of your rabid Free
Lance. -
Let us hope, if he is, he will find it no go,
And that GLADSTONE will blandly remark,
“Not for JOE | ?”
A DANGEROUS PET.
A MAN may keep almost any kind of pet
so long as he is not a nuisance to his neigh-
bours. He may harbour cats or cobras,
mice or monkeys, he may take to his heart
the gentle giraffe or the amiable armadillo,
may teach the festive flea to perform feats
of . or keep an elephant in his
back garden. But he may not keep living
Colorado beetles, and for the very simple
reason, that they are liable to escape, and
might bring a terrible plague on the country.
Thus it hº. that a farmer in a benighted
village in Devonshire known as Yealmpton,
has been fined for having twenty of these
dangerous insects in his possession, and we
are told he frequently exhibited them, so
that nothing was more probable than the
escape of one or more of these pests. He
has been very properly punished; and agri-
culturists with scarabaean proclivities had
better henceforward curb their yearnings
for living specimens of the Colorado beetle.
A Chieftain to Childers.
THERE has been considerable excitement
lately about . Breaches of Privilege” in
Parliament. The Irish have raised the cry;
but the Scotch will not be silent when there
is a question about touching their distinc-
tive Tartan, which, I'd have you to recol-
lect, Sir, must be ranked under the same
i. Think twice before you venture on
abolishing the Tartan, which my country-
men have gloriously worn in time of war or
in time of Trews.

TWOPENCE-HALFPENNY REWARD.
WE live in an age of revolvers., The world began it by revolving on its axis,
and now every pickpocket is armed to the teeth with Brummagem five-shooters,
sold wholesale, retail, and for exportation at less than five pounds a dozen.
Every shopboy is fitted up like a pirate or the captain of a press-gang, and it
would probab }. not be safe to assume that even a pew-opener is unprovided with
the fashionable weapon. This being the case, it is not surprising that the
ordinary area-sneak, the prowler about unfinished houses, includes a revolver
among the iº of his trade. The only persons who are astonished at
this are Mr. Howarp VINCENT and the Defective Police, who live in an atmos-
phere of panic and ignorance. The wretched creature who shot a policeman
and a postman at South Kensington is not an isolated ruffian, as the Defective
Department of Scotland Yard seems to suppose, but is simply a sample of a
hopeful crowd of would-be burglars, who are not to be captured, reformed,
dismayed or exterminated by a reward of Twopence-Halfpenny.
It may not be advisable to trust the police with firearms, so that they can
return shot for shot, but it is certainly advisable to show a determination to
stamp out crimes of violence. A chandler's-shop policy in Scotland Yard and
at the Seldom-at-Home Office will not do this, but will encourage the thieves,
in the same way as Irish crime and obstruction were lately encouraged. If
well-paid officials think they owe no duty to the public in this matter, they had
better say so at once, let the public take care of themselves—which they are
uite capable of doing, and not waste, print and paper in offering rewards
that are disgraceful and ridiculous. In the meantime, it would be as well if
they protected their humble instruments, the police, who are not paid to be
shot down in the execution of their duties.

A KYRLEY TALE.
AIR-"A Norrible Tale.”
OH a curious tale I am going to tell
Of the singular fortunes that befel
A family which late resided -
In a slum by High Art much derided.
They never dreamed of the Weird Intense,
Though a family of undoubted sense,
Till a Kyrle Man came with his lyre and lily,
And drove that unfortunate household silly.
He came, soft carolling “Lo! I come !
My mission's the bringing of Beauty home!”
And he opened the door, and he led her in,
A weariful damosel pale and thin.
With eyes as dusk as the veil of Isis
Like an incarnation, she seemed, of Phthisis.
When in he ushered this spectral Psyche, .
The family's comment all round was “Crikey!"
But the spell was on them, º stood and gazed
Till their souls grew dim and their sight grew dazed;
From the youngest child to the father burly
Their views of life, straight before, grew Kyrley.
The father—he was a hearthstone vendor-
Strove to make his street-cry as subtly tender
As a Chopin Nocturne, and pined to a shade,
And ruined his voice, and lost his trade.
The mother—she used to go out to “char”-
Fell madly in love with a Japanese jar,
The pot, with gold scraps, in her basket left,
And was quodded for taste, which the law called theft.
The eldest son—and he carried a hod-
Yearned his ladder to mount with the grace of a god
In Attic story, but failed and fell
From the attic story, and ne'er got well.
The eldest daughter—a work-girl plain- -
Would touzle her hair and wear gauze in the rain;
º cold, sought cure in a peacock's tº
And died of # Art and the state of the weather.
And the other children, of whom there were nine,
For Consummate Beauty did º and pine ; .
To the Kyrle Man's goddess they clung, and quickly,
Like her, grew flabby and false and sickly.
One sunflower grew in their bare back-yard,
One boy—a boot-black—essayed the bard:
That spidery blossom º and cherished,
And, when cats killed it, he paled and perished.
Beefsteak another disdained to bite, --~ **
Because not “precious” nor “awfully quite”;
E’en the youngest quarrelled with brea -and-butter,
Because, though wholesome, it was not “utter.
So man, and woman, and boy, and girl,
They victims fell to that Man of Kyrle,
For Beauty languid and lackadaisy
Drives people crooked, and sick, and crazy.
And to bring her home to the poor man's shanty,
A pallid scarecrow in garments scanty,
Is }. folly foredoomed to fail,-
That's the straight tip to the Kyrley tale.

AN advertisement lately put forth in the Times, noti-
fying that the Resident Secretaryship of the Charing-
ross Hospital would shortly become vacant, informed
those whom it might concern that “Candidates must sº |
members of the Church of England.” . This has been
justly represented as equivalent to the intimation that
“No Dissenter need apply;” ... but, of course, the
Governors and Committee of Charing-Cross Hºspital
are in consistency prepared also to announce that "No
Dissenter need subscribe.” Only perhaps they consider
that announcement sufficiently implied by the other.

(Post Mark, St. Petersburg.)
THE Emperor presents his most fº compliments to Mr.
Punch, and has the greatest possible pleasure in ºliºs the
misapprehension that seems to have arisen about Cabul. His
Majesty has been more than annoyed at the malicious spreading of
so many false reports. SHERE ALI (who, His Majesty regrets to say,
forged all the documents recently published), spent the whole of his
life in attempting to create ill-feeling between England and Russia.
This misguided Asiatic, was constantly making proposals to the
Emperor—proposals that His Majesty repudiated with loathing,
hatred, and contempt! The Emperor regrets that the late AMEEE
should not be now in a position to corroborate His Majesty's solemn
declaration. But as Mr. Punch, is aware His Majesty's words
are as good as his bonds—if not better! As to the retention of
Candahar, the Emperor will be glad to discuss the matter fully with
Mr. Punch, if that Gentleman will be so good as to meet His
Majesty by appointment—in Siberia!
(Post Mark, Constantinople.)
THE SULTAN hastens to thank Mr. Punch for the handsome douceur
which reached His Mºjº', at a moment when it was more than
usually serviceable. Mr. Punch is quite right in believing that the
SULTAN is always ready to exchange a State Secret for a pecuniar
consideration. His Majesty knows a great deal about the Cab
affair—more than the CzAR, the late AMEER, and even Sir LEwis
PELLY himself. For *...* His Majesty would only hint that
the SULTAN has been offered half British India and the whole of
Afghanistan in exchange for Constantinople. His Majesty is fully
aware that he has only to make this known to the Government of
Her Britannic Majesty to receive compensation for the very consider-
able monetary loss his iſſiºn refusal entailed upon the Imperial
exchequer. His Majesty has already mentioned the matter to
Mr. Gosch EN (a singular3. agreeable person), who has kindly pro-
mised to see what can be done for him.
The SULTAN, in conclusion, would point out that he is in posses-
sion of a vast number of jº. secrets nearly affecting the
reputation of every Crowned, Head and Prime Minister in Europe.
His Mº has also in his collection several deeply interesting stories
about the Emperor of BRAZIL, the Mikado of JAPAN, and General
GRANT of the United States Army. In justice to himself, however,
the SULTAN has been forced to adopt as his Imperial motto, “No
more pay—no more startling disclosures' "

“THough Mr. PRIOR,” says a contemporary, commenting on that

‘has received a sound elementary education, yet, as he has not
mastered those higher sciences in which Factory Inspectors have to
ass, application has been made to the Privy Council for an order to

Why? If an acquaintance with the “higher sciences” is essential
to a proper discharge of the duties of a Factory Inspector, why
º: r. PRIOR to the post without it?
n these competitive days everybody is examined, and some
standards of merit must be fixed; and if fixed, adhered to. To
insist that the Beadle in the Burlington Arcade must be prepared to
“take up ’’ “deportment, dancing, single-stick, rhetoric, and a
familiarity with the minor poets,” and then to lº. with a good
half of these accomplishments, is at once to open a broad question.
Possibly, familiarity with minor, or even major poets, may be
no more necessary to an Arcade Beadle than the “higher sciences.”
are to a Factory Inspector. But if this be the case, why insist on
either ? Anyhow, if the Privy Council mean to "dispense” *ś.

PRIOR may be a reasonable one, but a precedent once set on foot for

ESSENCE OF
PARLIAMENT.
extracted proxi
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Mowday Night, Feb. 14:-Had a chat this evening with
Mr. BIGGAR, in whom find fresh resemblance to ºne of
our great men. I am told that upon closer acquaintance it
n discovered that RICHARD THE THIRD was quite a
mild and placable personage, and that OLIVER CRoxſwell
was not nearly so black as he has been painted in Ireland and
elsewhere. Similarly, upon closer acquaintance, I find Mr. Biggar
genial, affable, and well-informed.
At first a little misunderstanding arose owing to my ignorance of
foreign languages. I was standing in the Lobby, wondering what
Sir CHARLEs. FoESTER, was looking for, when Mr. Biggar passing
me, with a friendly smile, said,
* Voos alley beeang f"
“Sir,” I said, with what I flattered myself was a manner cal-
culated to take an Irish Member down, “ F.il submit the question
to the SPEAKER whether it is Parliamentary, even in the Lobby, to
address to another Hon. Member such a remark. When a dog has
lived i.lºng without acquiring a bad name, you may as well Not
g -
But it was all a mistake. Mr. BIGGAR explained it with great
clearness. It was French, and meant, “You’re pretty well, aren't
you?”., I asked Mr. BIGGAR, not to talk in foreign languages any
more, I being wholly ignorant of them, and he said he would not.
It a H. he has been to Paris, whence this fluency. He told me a
ºf eal about the city, how the *...*. are still in ruins; how
*...} the streets Booleyvards, and how at least one is nearly as
wide as Sackville Street; how the shops are open on Sundays, and
the churches every day; how nice-looking girls go about their busi-
ness in black dresses and no bonnets; how some of the cabmen wear
white-glazed, hats, and none are able to understand French. In
fact, this last was a peculiarity which seems to have struck Mr.
** w w \, *\- \\ v.
BIGGAR most forcibly. “They are thorrowly igrant of their own
language,” Mr. BIGGAR says. -
Amongst other incidents of travel he told me how, on entering a
cab, he had said to the man, “Ahlair.” which, it seems, it is neces-
sary to do when you want to take a cabman by the hour; that is
much cheaper, Mr. BIGGAR says. He entered the cab at ten minutes
to eleven on Sunday morning at the stand by the Maddyleene, and
it was twenty minutes past eleven before the cabman could
make out that he wanted to go to the Roo Poisonyer, which, I
understand, is not an incentive to crime, but the name of a street.
Several men with cocked hats and swords came up, and quite a
crowd of men and women, who jabbered at each other whilst Mr.
BIGGAR sat reclining in the cab. - -
“I was thorrowly comfortable,” Mr. BIGGAR said, “and in the
House, you know, we always let the other side talk when they will,
as it helps us to pass the time. So I sat there and said nothing
except ‘Ahlair! Roo Poisonyer.’” Finally there was a great

hrieking in the crowd. Someone had, it seemed, understood his own
language at last, and the cab went off. Mr. BIGGAR had other places
to go to, and when the round was finished, the man wanted to charge
this thirty minutes spent at the outset; , ,
Mr. BIGGAR declined to pay him. Finding that there was no hope

tomary succinctness. In the end he was hooted into his hotel. But

tion on which he was dumb was as to his business in Paris, and his
interview with Mr. PARNELL and other interesting persons of whom,
as Sir W. HARcourt says, “some of them live in Ireland and a
eat many in America.” When I touched on this subject Mr.

Tuesday Night.-Great sensation on the Opposition. Benches to-
night, owing to the reappearance of JAck HolºB, better known to
the public as SIR John HolkBR, Attorney-General in the last
Administration, JACK has never taken very kindly to his seat in
the House, partly because when it was fixed on the Treasury Bench
there was so little of it. There is a great deal mºre space in these
times for leaders of the Conservative party; but Jack has not been
able to overcome his old prejudices. Being back to-night he thought
he would have a little flutter, and succeeded. . . . -
- I enter this in my diary, under
the date Tuesday night, for the
convenience of the officials of the
State Paper Office, in whose
hands the manuscript will, I sup-
pose, eventually fall. it was
actually at one o'clock to-morrow
morning that J. looking in on his
way home from a consultation,
thought he would stir up the
Committee. Perhaps the idea did
not occur to him till after he had
been asleep on the Front Bench
for a quarter of an hour. He
dropped off, after voting with the
Government against a proposal
made by Mr. StANSFELD that Mr.
PARNELL, or anyone else arrested
under the Act, should have full
particulars of the time, place, and
character of his crime set forth
on his warrant.
This disposed of, by a majo-
rity which J. visibly swelled, Mr.
O'Donnell rose and moved an Amendment, which, to ordinary
sense, seemed uncommonly like that just decided upon. How-

ever it be J. suddenly awaking, and seeing before him the present Bill
Attorney-GENERAL, FoRSTER, BRIGHT, and several other ºf his
natural enemies, with a sudden impulse, bent his great head, and
ran amuck at the Treasury Bench. Amid vociferous cheerin from
the Irish patriots, J. declared for the new Amendment, and with
§ voice protested his unalterable affection for the British
onstitution. en he sat down, feeling he had rather done it.
And so he had. HENRY JAMEs, not always an effective Parlia-
mentary, speaker, saw his opportunity, and used it unmercifully,
J., he pointed out, had voted against STANSFELD's Amendment, and
now declared for Öponsº’s.” What did he mean, or what did he
want? It began to dawn upon J. that there was a mistake some-
where, and as Irish Members, pleased at the prospect of capturing a
Conservative ex-Attorney-General, insisted upon a division, the only
thing for him to do was to clear out; which he did with great
alºrity, leaying the British Constitution to take care of itself.
This would have been very well if he had now gone home,
or, if it was too early, if he had attended another consultation.
But with that curious fate that sometimes draws men on, he was
lured back to the House, and another Amendment, again like the
first, being proposed, J., madly dashed in again, waving the Royal
Standard, and declaring his determination to spend the i. drop of
his blood on behalf of the Constitution, which had borne the battle
and the breeze on the rocky plains of Greenland's icy mountains and
amid the swart desert of the tropic zone. More cheering from the
Irish Members, and then re-enter this troublesome JAMEs with
lite inquiry as to what his hon, and learned friend was going to do
in respect of this Amendment freshly advocated P, Was he going to
vote for it, or was he again going to run away when the division-
bell rang? Happily.J. was saved further trouble by the Amendment
being withdrawn. But he had had a high old time, and felt that
Preston would be proud of him.

mode of progress is curiously akin
to that of the Protection Bill in

deliverance, I thought, it was all over; and when Mr. GLADSTº
moved his Resolution, I rather expected to see him lifted shoulder
high, and carried in procession round the lobbies. The Irish Mem-
bers thought so, too, and regarding this as their last oppºrtunity,
they determined to make the most of it. But presently it be to
be whispered that matters were going wrong. There was a flaw, in
the Rules, which made them an *...i on the rights of minorities.

A THEUE CHAIN OF IVINTS.
(Revised by The O'Macaulay.)
THE crisis came at last. Vindictive as had been the mood in which
the majority had left the House, the mood in which they returned to
it was more vindictive still. The debate had only reached its seven-
teenth night. But the Government in the meantime had not been
idle. DAVITT was on the rack at Portland. PARNELL had been sent
to the Tower in thumb-screws, and shown, with the crown jewels, on
the payment of an extra sixpence. LABouch-ERE was hiding among
the figures at Madame Tussaud's. Cow EN had had to consult a
solicitor. , Nor was this all. BIGGAR had been detected after dusk
letting out the carnivorous animals from the Regent's Park collection
with a false key. Twenty-seven were met, the next morning, by a
policeman in Soho Square, and brought before the presiding magis-
trate at Marlborough Street. The excitement in court was tremen-
dous. BIGGAR was warned, and fined a shilling.
The news spread like wildfire. At four that afternoon, as the
SPEAKER was about to leave his dressing-room, an intruder, hysterical
and covered with mud, burst, without knocking, into his presence.
It was GossETT. The tale was soon told. In another minute, both
the great officials were shaking each other's hands in silence, and had
fallen, weeping like children, upon each other's necks.
House was waiting. BRAND was a man of some parts, had taken
lessons in deportment, and forty years ago. had been known on the
pier at Margate for his knowledge of punctilio. To-night he mounted
the step leading to his chair with a Turkish towel in his waistcoat
pocket, a hair-brush in each hand, and his wig reversed.
e House was in no mood for satire. §. from former
| sleeplessness, drunk with recent triumph, burning with implacable
But the
resentment, confident of irresistible strength, it rose, as one man, to
its feet, and roared. The Šºken was equal to the occasion. He
“named ” the whole House. Nobody heeded him. There were
some feeble cries raised for “GossETT.” But it was whispered in
the lobbies that GossETT was already in a four-wheeled cab, well on
his way to Wapping. , Men who remembered the first French Revo-
lution shook their heads. Those who did not, looked out of window.
But all were unanimous on one point. It was clear that the
Executive was coming to the end of its tether.
And a remarkable circumstance had led to this. It had long been
been mined, and was but waiting the si
swift and complete destruction. The plot was diabolical, but com-
rehensive. accident revealed it. A member of the Beefsteak
ub found a fifty-ton dynamite revolving detonator, fully wound
up and in motion, in the umbrella-stand of the establishment. He
had just paid his subscription, and had come to dine. He did not
hesitate what to do. He sent the infernal machine, by a messenger,
to ºn; Street. The parcel arrived in the middle of a Cabinet
Council. It was hurriedly dispatched, with a bag of buns, to the
water-fowl in the neighbouring Park. But the Ministry clearly saw
that the ºº:: had given them an opening. And they determined
to take it. That night HARcourt was ºf'; with an empty
marmalade pot, a pair of scissors, and a jug of hot water, into the
General Post-Office.

than the daring that originated it. HARcourt was a known lam-

TAYLOR and CHARLEs READE's Masks and Faces at the Haymarket
it would be difficult to imagine. - -
It is, we venture to say, perfect down to the slightest detail, and
each character, however small, acquires in the present revival an
importance that years ago it would have
been impossible to obtain. The costumes
have been most artistically designed by
the Hon. LEwis WINGFIELD. . .
The outline of the story is this:–Mr.
Ernest Vane—
a very weather-
cocky young
man from the
country, where
he has left his
wife, Mabel,
comes to Town,
and, meeting
the fascinating
Actress, Peg
Waffington, im-
mediately, that
is, from “When
first he saw A WANE APPEAL To A SPEARING Likeness,
sweet Peggy”
—falls over head and ears in love with her, and she with him.
Poor Mabel, charmingly played by Miss MARIox TERRY, arrives
unexpectedly, learns the true state of affairs, and interviews Mrs.
JP'affington, imploring the Actress to give up her husband—as if he
were a riddle, which he isn't a bit.
Peg is deeply touched by the wife's pleading, and decides to
restore to its lawful owner the property which she cannot legally
keep., Not without a struggle, she rightly concludes that Ernest
Vane's heart is networth keeping ; and perhaps she is so certain of
her hold over him, that—
“She knows when she likes she can whistle him back,”
as, having once had the smallest taste in life of the pleasures of the b
town, he will probably soon weary of provincial monotony. How-
ever this may be, Mistress Margaret Woffington dismisses him,
embraces Mabel as a sister, and comforting i. with the reflection
that there's very little valuable ore in that Vane, renounces him for
ever, and sobbing as if her heart would break, rests her aching head
on her poor friend Triplet’s shoulder.
Mrs. BANCROFT, as the Peg on which the whole plot hangs, is
charming in her double character of actress and true woman.
Through the artificial airs of the accomplished comédienne she has
to allow her good woman's heart to show itself, and when she would
give much to yield to her best impulses, she has to disguise them
and assume the mask of Comedy. The best instance of this is in
the Second Act, where she foils Sir Charles Pomander's design by
her own ready wi
The piece is
Wit.
full of real comedy situations, but the best of all
are, to our thinking,
her scenes with Triplet
and with the Triplet
Family, none of which
can be seen by anyone
who is not ashamed of
a silent tear trickling
down the side of his
nose, without that
uncertain sort of qui-
vering sensation in the
throat and eyelids
which, in sensitive
natures like our own,
results in a very evi-
dent application of the
pocket - handkerchief
to the nasal organ,
under cover of which
movement we, like the
soldier who “leant
upon his sword” –
“wiped away a tear”
—infact, several tears,
which annoyingly followed each other, tickling and trickling down
our furrowed cheeks. At all these scenes in Masks and Faces, you
are, we mean we were, either crying or laughing, or doing both
together, and were delighted when, at the end of the Act, we were led
*:::::: a friend to the enjoyment of coffee and a cigarette in the
smoking-room, which, we may take this opportunity of stating, is

RUN of THE PIECE), AND THE HAPPY WALET,

like that of the House of Commons, not a quarter large enough for
its visitors.
In Triplet the poor Author, Mr. BANCROFT, gives us_a touching
portrait of a broken-down Gentleman of education—a Jack-of-all-
trades, yet never master of one—who, by force of circumstances,

has come to be a literary hack, writing comedies in a garret, while
his liren are about #. crying for bread, and his wife is a helpless
InValld.
“We have given honesty every chance,” he cries, in despair.
“No, JAMEs,” replies i. wife, “not yet—not till we . died as
we have lived.”
Then comes in the merry lady, Peg, and the little black page with
a pie, and the children are fed, and the wife is comforted, and
there is sunlight in the house, and we are warmed by that touch
of nature which makes the whole world kin, and which in this
scene, alone would secure Messrs. REApr and Taylor's comedy to
the ; for any time to come.
Triplet, as represented by Mr. BANCROFT, and as drawn by the
Authors, reminds us forcibly of Newman Noggs in Nicholas Nickleby.
“I was a gentleman once,” says poor Noggs'; and Triplet, in taking
leave of Mabel Vane, hºpes that ºil the interview he has
ehaved as a gentleman.’
Space will nºt permit of further details. The performance all
round is as good as it can be.

MODERN DINNERS.
THE new arrangement of din-
ners is excellent. First, soup, re-
commended by Sir HENRY THoMP-
son as a sort of prelude which
‘‘soothes the savage breast,” and,
like the culture of the fine arts,
“softens the manners, and does
not allow us to be any longer
ferocious ” – then, next course,
Fish; and then, without any inter-
mediate flirtation with entrées,
comes the pièce de résistance, the
Joint.
It comes exactly when it is
most wanted. The hungry man
has not frittered away a good
appetite on “kickshaws,” and is
ready to tackle his beef or mutton
with a will. Then follows a tiny
kickshaw, if you will; a separate
course of vegetables, certainly;
then a bird with a salad. Cheese
to finish. Sweets superfluous.
One thing more, — let the
“Menu" be the “Bill of fare,”
and let ºverything that can
in English be in English. So go
it, ye Gourmets'
As it Ought to Be.
LAST week, Mr. DRONSFIELD
Mill owner, atoldham was charged

gement of the law, his Man-
ager, the real culprit in this in-
stance, was, by a provision of this

A RUM STORY.
''No HING like leather ' " Pannuscorium? No. You cannot get
out of Pannuscorium what you can get out of leather—shoe-leather;
old shoe-leather.
By some of the latest accounts from America, there is, among
certain," Curious, Industries in New York,” a particular industry
}." in the collection and utilisation of old shoes, especially those
ound lying cast about the streets in New York and Brooklyn.
Some of those old shoes are patched, if needful, and if needful
also, matched. Of some old pairs one partner only is worn out;
that pair is divorced, and the shoe that still has wearin it assorte
with another similar old shoe, paired and repaired both, in case they
want mending. The odd old shoe unfit for matching is cut up for
patching, and some residual old shoes are applied to a purpose to
which you can't apply Pannuscorium. The matchable and patch-
able having been patched and matched—
“. Next, the shoes not worth patching are cut into pieces: the good bits are
used for patching other shoes, and the worthless bits are converted into
Jamaica rum by a process known only to the manufacturers. It is said they
are boiled in pure spirit, and allowed to stand for a few weeks, and that the
product far surpasses Jamaica rum made in the ordinary way.”
The footings for a superior Jamaica rum thus furnished by effetelb
old shoes must at º contribute to the constitution of a rum
spirit., This can hardly however be said to be a compound of spirit
and sole, as it is apparently prepared from the “ upper leathers.”
Sherry Cobbler has long been celebrated as an American drink, but
who has hitherto ever heard of Old Shoe Rum? The proof of the
rum is of course in the drinking; and rum consisting of proof spirit
flavoured with old shoes may be delicious, but one would think that
eyen a Professor. Porso N, would hardly drink it if he knew it,
although the Professor did once drink the contents of a naphthal
lº *#. not knowing it, but taking it for whiskey.
The Temperance League. the other day interviewed Lord North-
*Rook with a view to ameliorate the lot of our sailors by procuring
the stoppage of their pittance of grog. In the endeavour to wean
Jack Tars from grog, the Admiralty might perhaps, hope to succeed
by issuing grog-rations composed of American Qld Shoe Rum. Only,
if “that product” really “far surpasses Jamaica rum made in the
ordinary way,” few seamen would be likely to be deterred from
drinking it by being told the manner of its production. The gene-
rality of sailors would too, probably recommend their informant, to
“tell that to the Marines,” and would §. on drinking the so-called

“That your petitioners regard with satisfaction a proposal which is now
under discussion in Parliament to abolish the offices of the Lord Chief Justice

“Your petitioners desire to express their opinion in favour of the abolition
of the offices referred to, tending as it does to consolidate the various Divisions
on the Common Law side of the High Court of Justice into one Division,
thereby placing the whole under one Presidency, which your petitioners
consider to be in conformity with the object and intention of the Legislature
on passing the Judicature Acts.”
Excellent notion' But why “consolidate ” in only one depart-
ment?, Why not “consolidate’” eveywhere? Let us go on “ con-
solidating.”
Instead of any number of Judges—roll 'em all into one.
Instead of hundreds of Barristers, let there be only one Barrister.
Let the entire Army be “consolidated” in one soldier: and the
same for the Navy.
The Police Force could be consolidated into one Policeman, and
the Criminal Classes be consolidated into one Burglar. Then let
'em fight it out. The Consolidated Burglar would—if captured—be
tried before a Consolidated Judge, prosecuted and defended by a
Consolidated Counsel, found guilty by a Consolidated Juryman, and
i. sentence of transportation for life could be consolidated into
anging.
Only—if the burglar wasn't captured? Perhaps the Incorporated
Law Society will suggest a remedy for this difficulty.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 97
THE * BUSY B " AT THE GAIETY.
IT is the fashion with some learned Critics of the present day to
deplore the absence of true Comedy from the modern stage, and to
recommend to our present Dramatic Authors the study of the fine old
crusted Comedies, which, like good port, ought to be all the better
for keeping—if not kept too long. Miss LITton, inspired by a ha
thought, has undertaken to put a series of these venerable and highly
estimated compositions before our eyes, and has chosen as her
theatre the temple where the sacred fire of burlesque is constantly
kept burning by night, while the afternoon is consecrated by our fair
High Priestess to keeping alive the dying embers of the “Light of
Other Days,”—or the Light Comedy of other days, and fanning them
—without any puffing—into a flame. Miss LITToN and Mr. John
Hot LINGsHEAD have given the playgoing public, critics, and drama-
tists the opportunity of seeing what had been so much talked of, so
little º and so highly#. Their efforts have been, we
trust, crown iwith succes.’ Fia goers and players, some critics, and
most authors will thank her for the iº those
authors who, in this degenerate age, have been boldenough to describe
their comedies as comedies, and their comedies in which the farcical
element has inated, as “farcical comedies.”
Let us e Susan NAH CENTLIVRE's “Comedy,” The Busybody,
capitally played at the Gaiety. , Had it been the work of a modern
dramatist, characters would had been pronounced, “impossible,”
the plot and situations “outrageously farcical,” and the “business,”
as “savouring more of pantomime and the hot poker than of true
comedy.” uch of the dialogue might have been described as
“sparkling,” and much more as tedious; while the occasional
breaking into blank verse and rhyming couplets would have appeared
more in place in an eccentric entertainment of the Pinafore pattern,
or in a burlesque. -
The scene with the dumb lady—admirably performed by Miss
LITTox, Mr. KYRIE BELLEw (not of the Kyrle Society), and Mr.
Howe-is º: farcical. he Fourth Act, where the lover
secretes himself first in the chimney, then behind a door, then behind
a screen, might have been legitimate in such a piece of modern tom-
foolery as Betsy, but would have been condemned as a blot on any
play of the º: time presuming to style itself a Comedy. The
perpetual, whackings bestowed on Marplot (Mr. Brough), by the
various characters, “have anticipated,” some critics would have
said, “the pantomime season; the old men are mere Pantaloons
one of the lovers a Harlequin who jumps through a window, and
Marplot himself simply a Clown, without the sausages and the butter-
slide.” But because all this occurs in an “old comedy,” it is admir-
ingly descri as “bustling.” Farcical improbability in old
comedy is “easily condoned,” but in a comedy denos jours it is unpar-
donable. The construction would have been justly blamed as
faulty, as, owing to certain omissions which curtail, the time of
representation but confuse the action, the last Act of this version
ExERCISE witH A DUMB BELLE.
seems rather the commencement of a new play than the finish of
the so-called Comedy.
Dramatic Authors have reason to be grateful to Miss LITToN, and
may continue with a safe conscience to style such of their works as
have as much, hiding and “practical business” as this Busybody
“Comedies,” though probably any one of the fraternity would have
honestly qualified such a piece as “farcical.” The French include
all laughable pieces, except bouffes, under the head of Comédie. As
there are Comedians and Low Cºmedians and Éccentric Comedians, so
are there yarious species of the genus Comedy which cannot be
classed under either farce or burlesque.
The Busybody is well worth a visit. With the exception of Sir
É. Airy, none of the characters, male or female, are supposed
tº belong to the high society in which Lord Qgleby or Sir }.
Teazle moved. Sir Francis Gripe (Mr. Howe) is an old “hunks”
of a moneylender; Sir Jealous. Traffick apparently “something in
the City," yaguely interested in some Spanish commerce—onions,
perhaps; Marplot is, according to Mr. BRough's view, a kind of
Tºny Lumpkin º. and Miranda a ready-witted, artful young woman,
whº gives very little evidence of a polite education. The great merit
of Miss LITTóN's performance is that she lets us see at once how
y natural gifts shine through her defective training, and what a
genuinely good wife she might become in the hands of a good man,
though her future career as my Lady Airy is doubtful.
No better º: of Sir George Airy could have been
found than Mr. KYRIE BELLEw, both as to appearance and acting;
his only fault being too much real earnestness for such a butterfly
ant. Mr. Howe is very fº as . Sir Francis Gripe; Mr.
WERITT º bilious and snarly enough for Sir Jealous Traffick,
though what may be his position in life it is difficult to determine

“PANToMIMICAL,” of course.
from his manner, dress, or style of residence, of which the exterior
resembles a barn converted into a dwelling-place, and the interior,
to our intense surprise, a veritable mansion. . However, one must ||
never judge by exteriors, and this is a case in point.
Mrs. INCHBALD, in her preface to The Busybody, informs us that ||
“this comedy, which has survived one hundred years, was, by the
Actors who performed it, expected to die on the first night.” Again

“Marplot is the sole support of this comedy;”, which is not the

Mowday.—Mr. Gosch EN called upon me. He was rather reserved
but declared “that England had no arrière pensée.” Then he aske
me if I could suggest anything. On the spur of the moment I hinted
that a pension of half-a-million sterling a year out of the British
Civil List and the reversion of the Crystal Palace, might serve as a
basis for further negotiations. He said he would consider it. Was
astonished to find that he had not a * fifty-pound note about him
which he was able to lend for a month !
Tuesday.—Asked Gosch EN to lunch. He was still very reserved.
He said that he was sure that the House of Commons would ob-
ject to my suggestion about the British Civil List. Pension and
the reversionary interest in the Crystal Palace. Still, he was most
anxious to make the “solution of the question satisfactory, as far
as possible, to both parties.” ...Upon this, I º: that I should
surrender all my rights in Egypt (with the exception of those
attaching to the tribute) to the King of the Hellenes, on condition of
receiving, as an equivalent, the whole of Greece. Before we parted
I was amazed to learn that he had not a spare twenty-pound note
about him which he could lend for three weeks!
Wednesday—Asked G. J. Gosch ºn to déjeuner & la fºurchette. He
came late, and said that he had already lunched . Unhandsome!
He was more reserved than ever, and seemed depressed. The
Egyptian suggestion emphatically would not do—had I anything else
to propose? With a smile I * out a map, and pointed out the
frontier line on it, to which I said I would agree. On finding that I
had given him an old chart of South America with the title erased,
he was much annoyed. G. J. G. has no º of genuine
humour. Before taking leave, he informed me abruptly that he
was quite sure he had not a spare ten-pound note about him which
he could lend for a fortnight! - - -
Thursday.-George Gosch EN paid me a visit., I don't go to him,

should have three-fourths of our united sovereignties, ſimmediately
consented, on the condition that I should be allowed nine-tenths ºf

some mathematical difficulty in carrying out this sensible arraº
ment. Finally agreed to see him to-morrow. In the meanwhile,
was rather hurt at discovering that he had not a spare guinea
about him which he could lend for a week!
Saturday-The person I had grown accustomed to regard as “my
dear old friend George,” looked in as usual. Admitted the sºlu;

yet he calls himself a financier. At his invitation made further
suggestions. Here are three of them:-Things to be restored to the

A GREAT success has been

“Sunday Classical Concerts” by
an Austrian violoncellist, one
M. PoppER, enthusiastically ap-
lauded in the performance of a
antasia, “La Danse des Elfes,”
composed by himself. In Lon-
don the proper observance of
Sunday, as by Law prescribed
shuts up all places of intellectual
and spiritual recreation like
Concert-Rooms, so as entirely to
preclude the possibility of any
such entertainments as Classical
Concerts on that holiday; but
there is no just cause to debar us
from the pleasure of hearing
M. PoppER, ere long perhaps, at
the “Monday Pops.”
Those Concerts also consist
mainly of Classical Music, which,
as peculiarly tending to refine
and elevate the mind and feel-
ings, is . esteemed , particularly
suitable in England to any da
of the week except Sunday, an
may therefore be performed b

RAvex and Lord RoseBERY may
not care to visit Clubs on Sunday,

why should they attempt to force
their views upon numbers of per-
sons who hold different opinions

assion for proselytism and uni-

have paved London—especially

of the public-houses on Sunday morning. Groups of º, re-

merrily brushing away the soot-flakes that fall in showers on their
upturned faces, as they try, now and then, to get a glimpse of
far-off blue sky through some rift in the leaden volume % stifling
atmosphere that hangs, like a pall, about the reeking and battered
chimney-pots of the locality, and shuts out all sunshine, light, and

church clock chimes the }. of one: when the door of an attrac-
tive Gin Palace opens, and discovers the proprietor, ready on the
.# offering, gallons of adulterated alcohol gratis, to any who
will only seek some trifling relaration on his premises. As he
does so, several Model Sunday-observers turn away in polite
disgust.
First Model Observer. No, no, my good Master;, spite the attrac:
tive prospect you present to us of being made both very drunk and
very ill for nothing, we must decline your allurements. (Surveyi

Second Model Observer. Nay, Mr. Publican, I grant you it is an
attractive picture. But you forget we have stronger attractions
elsewhere. (With feeling.) Think you, on this, the one holiday of
our toiling week, we can tear ourselves from our dear dirty, damp,
dismal old Street ! Never !
All. Never ! [They retire up and wipe away a furtive tear.
First Model Observer. No, indeed not! For after the grinding
strain of six days of constant labour, what more delicious, more
exhilarating, §§ more respectable method of spending our one
interval of rest, than by loafing about listlessly in the grime and filth
of our beloved locality!
Second Model Observer (brightly). Staring at the dark walls and

as white as paste-pots for want of a breath of fresh air!—

ing at Paris a Museum on the Model of that at South º
and, to have something to º in it, as a start, has conceived the
happy idea, of emptying the Government offices of certain “old
cabinets and furniture,” which a contemporary alleges are at the
present moment entirely “thrown away on Ministers and subordi-
nates, who would º prefer modern and less artistic fittings.”
The conception is excellent, and if, Officialism on this side of the
water is only in the mood for “new fittings,” steps should be taken
immediately to give it some practical º for a Ministerial “col-
lection” at Brompton would be invaluable,
(1) “Waste-paper basket, used by Mr. GLADSTONE after reading
the Turkish Despatches,”—for instance; or
(2) “Gum bottle and hot water-can, supplied to the Home-
Secretary during his raid on the General Post-Office,” and
(3) “Extra wig prepared for the SPEAKER, in case of riot in the
House of Commons on promulgation of the New Rules,”
are interesting items that at once suggest themselves as a good “go
off.” for any Catalogue. There is practically no limit to what might
follow: for anything from a common office poker, waved in triumph
at a Cabinet Council, down to a patched, re-covered, and worn-out
woolsack, would have a special historic interest. The idea is capital.
It is to be hoped something will come of it.

FRAGMENTS FROM AN UNPUBLISHED BLUE B00K.
From Somebody in Command Abroad to Nobody Responsible at Home.
. I THINK it my duty to inform you that there are signs of disaffec-
tion in this ğ. that may, if not met soon by a prompt and
energetic display of force, possibly lead to serious consequences. On
good authority, I hear, that if the situation becomes acute, we may
expectfully 6,000 well-armed men in the field against us. As I have
at present under my command but one company and a drummer-boy
of the 200th, a mountain gun, the ammunition for which has not yet
arrived, and five mºn .# the Naval Brigade, I should be glad to
º Her Majesty's Government realised the gravity of the
tlâtion.
From Nobody Responsible at Home to Somebody in Command Abroad.
Yoſh ridiculously alarmist despatch to hand. How often shall I
ave to impress on you that what you, describe as the “gravity of
the situation.” abroad, must depend solely on the look of the Estimates
at home? We are, you must º thoroughly aware, pledged not to
*pend money.
The arrival of your communication is, therefore, all the more
intimely, as orders had already been issued for the return of half
the i. together with the gun, now at your disposal. I trust
by the ate this reaches you that the sensational rumours will have
been satisfactorily dissipated.
Somebody in Command Abroad to Nobody Responsible at Home.
I REGRET to inform you that I was attacked yesterday by an over-
Whelmingly superior force, and am in consequence now holding this
Colony, as well as I can, in Her Majesty's name, with the assistance
of my Aide-de-Camp, the drummer-boy, and a couple of friendly
natives. I really must impress on you the necessity of sending out
Some reinforcements.
Nobody Responsible at Home to Somebody in Command Abroad.
YoUR despatch inexplicable. It simply means another £100,000
on to the Estimates. This is most annoying. However, as the
situation seems embarrassing, you will be strengthened at once by
the re-despatch of the half company, an additional drummer-boy,
and the ammunition for the mountain gun.
Somebody in Command Abroad to Nobody Responsible at Home.
I REGRET to have again to inform you, that I have been over-
whelmed by superior forces, and after being utterly routed, am now
holding this ‘. in Her Majesty's name, b self, disguised,
in a ditch. I attribute this result to the difficulty Y experienced in
persuading the enemy that the force I have hitherto had at my dis-
posal, represented, in reality, the tremendous might of an Empire
that could hold its own, if necessary, against half the civilised world.
I shall be glad of reinforcements.
Somebody (vice Nobody resigned) at last Responsible at Home
to Anybody in Command Abroad.
CRISIs fully appreciated by H.M. Government. You will have
15,000 men at your disposal within three weeks, and a further 10,000
(if necessary) whenever you wire for them. This will cost the
country not a penny under Ten Millions. But never mind. We
should like, though, to know (in confidence) who is to blame for the
miserable dribbling system which has led to all this disaster, and
now colossal outlay.
Anybody in Command Abroad to Somebody (at last) Responsible
at Home.
THANKs for the reinforcements. We can now probably effect with
twenty thousand men what, three months since, we could have
managed with four. In strict confidence (I don't wish this to go
further), Nobody was really responsible for the miserable dribbling
to which you refer.

ANOTHER CRY FROM CLERKDOM.
THE following is assumed to be the form of letter addressed to a successful
candidate for the post of Telegraph Clerk under Government; and Mr. Punch
need scarely say it is received with tears of honest gratitude by the father of
a family of seven, who, having half starved himself to educate his children,
sees his eldest lad, the young hopeful of the family, appointed to a position of
respectability and trust:-
SIR,
I AM directed by Her Majesty's Postmaster-General to inform you
that you have been selected from several hundred candidates, after a competitive
examination in which the rudiments of scientific telegraph are included, to
fill the post of Telegraph Clerk, and you are required to take up your duties
immediately. -
In order distinctly to mark the difference between your position and that
of the ordinary members of the Civil Service in general, your hours of daily
attendance will be eight instead of seven; you may be expected to be call
upon to continue to serve at the office, whether fatigued or not, at the close of
your ordinary labours; º: Sundays and the ordinary holidays of the year,
such as Christmas Day, Bank Holidays, &c., must be cheerfully accorded to the
State that so graciously employs you; and it is expected that your services will
be available on ordinary days from seven o'clock in the morning until eleven
o'clock at night.
Your position differing so entirely from the ordinary Artisan who has so many
interruptions in his labour, and who spends the whole of º dawdling,
drinking, and getting paid, you will have no holidays at all throughout the
year, and as payment in cash for overtime is considered derogatory to your
position, your overtime will be occasionally credited to you as leave to be taken
at hours most convenient to the Service and not to yourself.
As your official superiors are anxious to avoid repre-
sentations of inefficiency by means of mbling letters
in the public papers, you will be #..". instant dis-
missal for the slightest inaccuracy caused by the hurry
of business and the illegible handwriting of transmitters
of messages; , and as you will be constantly harassed
by seductive bribes for revealing information to news-
paper touts and private detectives, you are warned that
penal servitude is the consequence of any breach efoſficial
trust.
On occasions of public rejoicing and national emer-
gency, when provisions are dear, and beds at a premium,
you may be ordered down to a distant part of the country
to aid in the transmission of news, speeches, and de-
scriptive reports, in which case you will be necessarily
compelled to leave your wife and family, and your
subsistence allowance will be twopence an hour.
Being deprived of any holiday, and compelled to work
in unhealthy offices, and in a stifling atmosphere, you
may be liable to sickness, in which event, unlike the
other members of the Civil Service, you will only receive
two-thirds of your pay.
By reason of the possession of special qualifications such
as honesty, integrity, and punctuality, you will be paid
at the rate of £65, a 3. for eight years—less wages
abourer, and after twenty years'
service, when you may expect to be married, settled,
and educating your children, your honorarium will be
£160 per annum.
You will be required to affix your signature to these
conditions, and understand that any complaint, agitation,
united meeting, or conference º treated as a breach
of discipline, and render you liable to instant dismissal,
and the stigma attached to removal from the Public
Service. I am, Sir, yours obediently,
THEoPHILUs Dock ETT (Secretary).
On handing this death-warrant to the promising lad,
the father of the family congratulates himself on freedom
from an incubus, and hails one of the many blessings
of a paternal government.

THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Mowday Night, Feb. 28.-Great thing to have
a man in the #. like WALTER JAMEs—a man
who, will sacrifice, the possible º of a
whole evening to the service of the State. To-
might, after closely º: sition, he
went home, carefuſly dressed himself in black,
put on a white necktie, parted his hair in the
middle, sedulously brushed it till every hair was
straight, and then suddenly, appearing below
the gangway, denounced. Obstruction., Plan
cleverly conceived, admirably carried out.
Business of the evening, Army. Estimates.
CHILDERs taken up impregnable position on the
Treasury Bench, in laager composed of red
leather Treasury box and bundles of papers.
But he never got a chance to open fire, and,
inspanning at twenty minutes to twelve, began
to trek. -
Fact is, business of the night being Army
Estimates, naturally suggested to Mr. O'Donnell
the question of bail for Prisoners in Ireland;
to Mr. McCoAN the present condition of the
Irish Magistracy; and to Mr. DAwson, the law
relating to the º of fines and fees in
Petty Sessions. this had not been enough,
Mr. Biggar was ready with a few remarks on
the flora of the Mountains of the Moon. Won-

would leave to others the exposure of the hope-
less character of my countrymen.
Just on the stroke of half-past twelve, when
WALTER JAMEs came in and made the import-
ant and surprising discovery that Irish Mem-
bers had been engaged in wilful obstruction.
At this insinuation Mr. HEALY shocked, Mr.
ARTHUR O'Connor surprised, Mr. Sexton
wounded to the quick. This made three more
speeches; but, as the work was done, CHILDERs
bowled out, the Government spited, the House
flouted, the natural curiosity of the Army
baffled, and the night wasted, they were short.

including a copy of Carendish on Whist, which accidentally lay on
the table. At last proper book forthcoming. Quite touching to see
the PREMIER put on the Black Cap and sentence Mr. HEALY to be
suspended. House divided, Mr. HEALY voting for himself. Showed
no disposition to withdraw when the will of the House was declared.
Captain GossET began to feel for his sword, and the six elderly

SIR,-There’s
a smart young
chap who's

because he’s a

was helped to a
gorgeous new
shoful - cab one
day — a Forder
with atent
sashes and plated
lamps, and a
looking-glass in-
side, and a flashy
º silver
tray for cigar-
ash, which cost a
pound, and is
worth about ten-
pence-topping,
slap-up, and ve
expensive – an
on the strength
of it he mounted
a crest upon his
panels, to which
he had no right, and invested in a new rug and a macintosh like
riven snow (excuse poetry, because apt to a driver). All the old
Ladies in Piccadilly waggled their umbrellas at him; but, bless
you! he wouldn't take no notice. Down St. James's Street he
trundled, in hopes of landing the Prince of WALEs at least, and
loitered opposite WHITE's. #. was a fat swell, with wavy hair
in the bow-window, recovering himself with B.-and-S., who stared
at him with eyes like oysters. Presently, when he felt better, he
came out, climbed into the cab, and sat there, speechless. “Where
shall I drive, my Lord?,” asks Bob. (He knew he was a Lord-
his boots, were so shiny.) . But, his Lordship was not well, and
really didn't care. He took a dyspeptic view of life: “To any
Club about!” he muttered faintly; and so he spent his after-
noºn. And so, he spent all the rest of that season, Sir. Bob was
ordered every day at eleven, at the rate of two guineas per diem; and
no night-work, with the option of putting up in his Lordship's
stables till wanted, when the wind was too cold for his horse. You'll
scarcely believeme, Sir, I daresay, when I inform you that Bob sat
smoking his pipe in them stables sometimes till it was time to take
my Lord out to dinner at eight P.M. ' His cab had had no wear and
tear, his horse had been gently exercised up and down the aristo-
cratic thoroughfare, and fed on his Lordship's oats, while Bob had a
cosy feed on his own account in the housekeeper's room. Hot,
with cheese and celery, in a overgrown wine-glass. And this not
once or twice, but four days out of six. Wasn't that a good berth
to tumble into ? And there are many of the smart, good-looking
young fellows who have jobs like that. -
utin Bon's case he had too much of it. And we middle-aged
coves as can’t quite say we’re 'ºï. ood-looking, were not so
sorry as we º: to've been. His Lordship went so hard, at his
Lºndon life that he broke down—got seriously ill—and collapsed
like a spent balloon—could not get out at all, But like, many
invalids, he liked to coax himself into the idea that his qualmish-
ness would pass off, and that he'd be better by-and-by. The cab
wasn't allowed to stop in the stable now. It had to be a standing in
front of the hall-door in all weathers—rain, snow, or sleet-lest my
Lord might take a fancy, all of a hurry, for a drive, and Bob got
sickapacing up and down for ever. He spelt thro’ the newspaper,
read a book, with an occasional beseeching glance at his Lordship's
bedroom-window, in hopes that he might really be coming out, or
send him away. But º was my Lord crouched all of a º
ºnore goggle-eyed than ever, wrapped in, a blanket,...sipping gruel.
Sometimes a pal would whiskby, and, jealous of the job, would jeer
out, “Why, Bob, how’s this? Are you cemented to that there
paving-stone?” And then Bop, driven mad by the º , would
ring the bell, and askif he might go. Not a bit of it! His Lordship
liked to see the cab, and there the cab must stand for his friends as
came to sympathise to stare at over the window-blind, So in course
ºf time Bob got the horrors—just as I do when I look at my second
ºrse-and wanted to turnit up. The wurkuss would be a pleasant
change from the monotony of this. He knew by heart all the stains
upon the flags, all the grime-spots on the portico; watched the old
milkwoman over the way growing stouter and more bald about
her parting. He felt getting like Rip Van Winkle in the play I
once saw when a gen’leman gave me an order for the gallery-moth-
eaten and mossgrown and withered—and he didn't dare look up at
his Lordship's window as time went on, for his Lordship was gettin
thinner and thinner and whiter and whiter, and more hollow-ey
as summer gave way to autumn, and the leaves came dribbling down.
It seemed like some awful nightmare, and the poor young chap
became quite melancholic and in a decline-like from mere depression
of spirits, and terror of this slow death, and groaned every mornin
when it was time to get up, instead of springing out of bed as fres
as a daisy, and grooming the old horse as if it was a pleasure, and
rubbing up the brass furniture till it winked again. His life was
a burthen in spite of the two guineas per diem, and the grub tasted
like bran-for there was my Lord fading, fading, like a crumpled-u
ghost, and he felt it would be a relief if the coffin was to come roun
the corner with the mutes-let alone the sneers and the chips of his
brother cabbies who were envious.
But he wasn't such a foºl as to give it up. He had lately married
and, just as a beginning, did all that his pretty young wife asked of
him. She liked the cheque for twelve pounds every week, and spent
a good deal of it on bonnets and baby-linen. Unfortunate coves
like me, who, with a disreputable old growler, can't manage to scrape
together more than fifteen shillings a day, out of which SKINNUM
wants eleven, must not think of bonnets, and must trust to the
Fº for the linen when º ; and so, in a friendly sort of way,
told him not to quarrel with his porridge, or make too wry a face if
it burnt his mouth a bit. And there he is still-grown serious and
worn. You may see him any day-wet or º and down
in front of that gloomy, family mansion, blowing his fingers or
whistling, or stamping with his feet—the miserablestman on the face
of all creation—while his Lordship looks though the glass of the
º window, mumbling his cadaverous jaws over his gruel, or
puffing, at a little cigarette, gathering his blanket round with
shrivelled fingers, as he looks wistfully down at the slap-up shoful
that he’ll never get into "... and wonders at what hour he'll
go out. spectfully yours,

[MARCH 12, 1881,
WHAT IS A “RUN " ?
THIS is not a Sporting Co-
nundrum : no Foxhunter need
reply. We allude to a The-
atrical “Run.” -
An eminent Musical Com-
}. an equally eminent
ramatist, and Author, a
Joint-Stock Company, a num-
ber of distinguished Mana-
§. and Actors, a Chancery
udge, and a host of Chancery
Barristers, have been spend-
ing, much time and money
within the last week, in trying
to discover the exact meaning
of the theatrical term “run.”
Dictionaries were searched in
vain, and no wonder, as the
theatrical profession has a jar-
gon of its own.
“Run” is a word used in
dramatic circles to signify the
number of consecutive per-
formances of a certain piece
at a particular theatre. It is
used to represent as of equal
importance the most dispro-
portionate results. . It is ap-
plied to one hundred nights at |.
a theatre not much larger
than a furniture van, in the
same sense that it is applied
to one hundred nights at a
theatre the size of a Roman
forum. If the stage appealed
to the imagination behind the
curtain, as it sometimes ap-
peals before the curtain, the
poetical drama would not be
such a rarity.
MR. John DILLON thinks
that he will be one of the first
to be arrested under the Peace
Preservation Act. His friends,
it is said, share his present
conviction. We hope they
won't share his future one.

Mr. SULLIVAN take his P. at the piano, and Mr. GILBERT stand

[Prolonged applause, during which, Mr. SULLIVAN was assisted
over the Counsels' heads, on to the Bench, while Mr. GILBERT
mounted the table amidst some vociferous banter from friends
at the back of the Court.
Mr. W. S. GILBERT said:—
When we, good friends, discovered that “Fame”

We winked to each other, and said, “This game
Is a vast deal too High-Arty.”

The Plaintiffs were about to proceed with a second verse when
Mr. Russell interposed. He said he did not see the good of con-
tinuing this. They were met there this morning for the sole pur-
pose of having a good stare at a whole host of theatrical celebrities,
and he was most anxious for his part to produce his thirty odd like-
nesses at once.

the Prince of Wales's.

the book in a º:
Mr. Justice FRY. —Excellent. Now let’s look at somebody else.
Mr. John Hol.I.INGsHEAD, was then examined. He had, never
stopped the run of a piece in his life. On the contrary he had acted
on the principle that a piece that couldn't run, and wouldn't run,
º: to be made to run. He managed that very simply....He never,
if he could help it, allowed a piece to try to run without legs.
(Laughter.)
Mr. Justice FRY. —I suppose, Mr. HollingsHEAD, you see no 'arm
in that? [Roars of laughter.
Mr. ARTHUR SULLIVAN was the next witness. He said he was
first led away from the paths of virtuous High-Art *ś
by a gentleman who did the libretto of Coz and Bor. He woul
refer not to mention names. Regretted it exceedingly;...Yes, he
ad not stopped there. Meeting with his brother Plaintiff in the

admitted, found this “descensus Averni’’ remunerative. Oratorios,
as a rule, did not run anything like five hundred nights, and so were
never very satisfactory to the composer. ... He should say that the
market-price of a first-class oratorio, fully scored, with the band

engaged his “Own Special Special.” That Gentleman has been
requested to send only such intelligence as can be given to the
j. without injury to British interests. The following is the first
communication that has been received from him:-
Head-Quarters.
Here I am. I cannot tell i. exactly where, because that would
be playing into the hands of the enemy; nor can I give you any date,
for the same excellent reason. Doubtless you would like to learn
the number of forces under the General's command. But then,
“which General?” you might ask, and I certainly should be unable
to satisfy you. So if I cannot give you the name of the chief officer,
it woul absurd going into details about the force he has the
honour to command. In this I am sure you will agree with me.
You want to know, no doubt, how we are off for infantry, and I
frankly admit that I have means of gratifying your curiosity to the
utmost. But then patriotism steps in and §: me hold my pen. If
I gave you our “field state,” it would be published in the morning
in London, to find its way over here before the close of the same
evening. So you see that I should be guilty of a great breach of
duty if I said a single word upon the subject. I may hint, however,
in the most rded manner possible, that perhaps we have one
battalion, perhaps two hundred dozen, I must leave you to decide
which number is most likely to be with us. This will be a little
exercise for your intelligence and ingenuity.
As to cavalry, you can scarcely expect me to say much about them.
As 3. know the duty of mounted soldiers is to act as scouts. In a
itched battle they sometimes charge. Of course such a force would
useful here, as it would be useful anywhere. But have we such
a force? And here you press me too closely. I must respectfully
decline to say another word on the subject. I trust you will appre-
ciate this reticence. If your readers are disappointed, they must
tºle themselves with the reflection that what I do is done for the
st.
Artillery, too, is not an uninteresting topic. There are many, no
doubt, who would like to learn whether we have any guns with us.
Perhaps we have, perhaps we have not. If we have, our cannon can
scarcely fail of securing attention sooner or later. Sooner or later,
I repeat; and heartily §. that by fixing this date I have not been
guilty of indiscretion. Should you have any doubt upon this point,
please show my despatch to a military expert, and be guided by his
opinion upon the subject. You will not offend me by cutting the
passage out.
Send remittances—which are “the Sinews of War”—addressed to
me Poste Restante, Rue Jean Jacques Rousseau. I will take care
that it shall reach me safely. In the meanwhile do not be surprised
at finding the envelope of this letter bearing the Paris J.F.;
As I have already told you, and as I tell you again, my chief object
in life is to puzzle the enemy!

FAUST AND FURIOUS.
(A Nicht wi' Berlioz, and an Afternoon with Three Popular Performers.)
THE Musical Public is now paying BERLIOz nothing more than
what it barely owes him. His Faust is a grand work. -
Why in Oratorio or in the musical rendering of a Dramatic Legend
is it, necessary for the performers to keep the
words-and-music-books in their hands? Of
course, singers are required to hold their notes,
but not in this way. Is their memory so
very defective that, no matter how often they
may have sung their parts, they cannot get on
without these partitions? Is it a greater
effort to remember a dramatic legend, or an
Oratorio, than an Opera º Fancy on the
operatic stage the Artists fº º an
Opera holding the score of each Act before
their eyes, or Mr. IRVING, Mr. Booth, and
Miº Riº Tºny playing othello with books
of the play in their hands! -
The book of a Dramatic Legend which is to
be sung and not acted, should not be inter-
spersed with Stage directions. For example :-
art I., Sc. 1–" They disappear in the air.”

anything of the sort;, they sit, down quietly
on each side of Mr. HALL.f. Again- They

This applies to the same gentlemen, who
simply resume their seats, and the only air
they are taken through is the one conducted
by Mr. HALLſ, and played by the Orchestra
* and a most balmy air it was. The
Hungarian March is effective; the “Gaude-
amus igitur !” disappointing; and there is
nothing to equal Gounod's Soldiers' Chorus.
Miss MARY Davis, charming as Marguérite, is the only one of the
performers who appears in proper costume. If not quite the Maſ:
º: dress, it was a sufficient indication of it, and the idea might
adopted by Mr. Lloyd and Mr. SANTLEy, who, in future, could

SANTLEY could be in evening dress as far as the waistband, and then
he could be continued in tights a la Mefisto; and Mr. LLoyd as
Faust might reverse the notion, and come out in dress trousers, with
doublet, cloak, and collar. A propos of costume, in the present
libretto Faust is evidently particular as to his dress, the Author
having made him ask Mephistopheles,
“What boots to-morrow, Fiend?”
To which inquiry, however, his diabolical companion returns no
answer, implying by his silence that the Tomorrow will come–
never.
The most stirring, most dramatic, and, we should say, the one

The last partis the best of all, barring the serenade above-men-

the climax:—
Mephistopheles. His soul is mine for evermore!
Faust (naturally enough). Oh horror!
[“They plunge into the abyss.”—i.e., Messrs. LLoyd and
SANTLEY sit down comfortably, the former occupying his
time agreeably enough in talking to Miss Davis.
The Dramatic Legend ends with an Epilogue and a chorus of Celes-
tial Spirits, followed by loud acclamations from a delighted audience.
Last Saturday Madame SCHUMANN gave us “her last appearance
(but six)”—tº quote the advertisement, which reads like a sort of
stage “aside.” Were the line written dramatically it would be-
High Art-hur Chappell (aloud). Her last appearance (wink-
ing aside)—but six. [Erit slily.
Her reception was enthusiastic, as usual. Yet there is always a
certain shade of melancholy that must -
tinge the pleasure of any one who assists
at a concert of celebrities, arising from
the fact, not of it being their last appear-
ance bar six (why not “bar six” when
speaking of musicians, Mr. CHAPPELL, or
is it too sporting?)—but of being present

tion was as glorious a triumph as that of

Livan, we should have said Antioch.
The Martyrs of Penzance would be a
Ritualistic Opera. The selection on
Saturday deserved to be murdered rather
than justly executed, it being about the dullest thing we’ve heard
for some time. By way of relief, a pale young gentleman of feeble
appearance, but with a fairly strong voice, sang HANPEI's light and

enlivening effect. We recommend everyone to go to all “the Last

The Voting Market.
WHAT are called the “legitimate expenses” of elections yield
some curious results, and show that the cost of Voters varies like
the cost of beef oria bour. At Oldham a good substantial Liberal
voter could be had for 10d., while a Tory cost 1s. 6d., and the same
articles at Wolverhampton cost respectively 2s. 2d. and 16s. 1d. At
Hackney Radicals were as low as 10%d., and Conservatives as high
as 8s., and in nearly every borough the Tories were ºi,
higher in price than the Liberals. The nearest approach to an
equality was at Manchester, where the Liberal fetched 4s. 24d. and
the Tory 4s. 11%d. These are the lowest ready-money prices for the
political article, and no reduction is made on taking a quantity.

welcomed this break in their silence, which he alliteratively and
Dan-O'Connelly described as “beastly bellowing.” Then up rose
the Chairman, and his battle-cry “Arder I Arder " '' rang through

“A WACANcy in the Office of Black Rod is expected before long,”
says Truth, and as the post is one of the few “good things” lºft,
there will probably be an ugly rush for it. The place, however, is
by no means a sinecure. . In addition to the necessity he is under of
wearing black silk stockings in winter, cleaning the brasswork of
the Throne on Saturdays, teaching deportment to Peers under sixty,
and sharing any perquisites he may pick up in the Strangers' Gallery
with the policeman on duty and the Sergeant-at-Arms, Black Rod is
expected to know the cab-fares from the House to every part of the
Metropolis, the latest odds for the Derby, and, when they are in
season, the price of oysters. Add to this, that he is not aiſowed to
drink beer in the lobby, and that when the LoRD CHANCELLOR dies
on the Woolsack, he is called upon to pay the whole of the funeral
expenses, and provide suitable mourning for the Junior Bar, it will
be seen that £7000 a year, if an adequate, is not an out-of-the-way
figure for the duties of the office. Anyhow, whoever gets the

NO THOROUGHFARE.
THE complaints about the filthy City ditch called Lowest Thames
Street have been uttered for twenty years without avail, and now
the Corporation have invented a new line of defence. They refuse
to remove or abate the nuisance, and seem to claim the power of
removing the public. They contend that Lowest Thames Street is
a market, and not a thoroughfare, and that Billingsgate must endure
for ever, according to the sacred law of Wested Interests. This is a
brilliant idea for the Duke of MUDFord to º: If the public
complain—as they do complain—of Mud-Salad Market, and its
obstructions, the answer is, find other .#. as these are
Hiß property. When the reputed owners of markets have closed
the streets with muck, and the Black Sabbatarians have closed
all the taverns, and when the Metropolitan Board of Works has
ruined all the ratepayers in constructing fancy thoroughfares, the

HOW THE MONEY GOES.
THE Supplementary Estimates are out, and comprise some odd
amounts. y has the F.O. overshot its figure for telegrams b
£13,400? That is a stiff sum, and means a good deal of talk. Is
it possible that some friendly person at home has been preparing the
SULTAN's replies? Lord DUFFERIN, too, seems to have been quite
out in his “furnishing” estimates. He goes beyond his mark by
£1,800. His Lordship, should evidently have fallen back on the
... hire system.” But the most mysterious item is Lord CºwPER's
-- #. Money,” amounting to £2,770. This looks like the
capital of a Circus company, and a question on the subject might
well be asked in the House. Indeed, all the items are curious. It
is nevertheless satisfactory to find that with much judgment, no
gharge has yet been made for the feather-beds and fresh straw-
berries supplied to imprisoned Land-Leaguers, and that neither

A PROSPECTUS,
THE utter want of a solely asthetic paper having long been felt, it
hath seemed good to certain Anti-Philistines to conceive a journal
that shall fill the gap so long empty. Its name shall be The Lily.
The proprietors will exclude from the columns of the Lily all
that is known as “News;” also law and police-reports. The
dreary, verbiage called “ The Debates,” will be rigorously sup-
pressed. Should, however, an appreciative rural nook choose to sen
one of the proprietors of the Lily to Parliament as its representative,
that proprietor will be entitled to report his own speeches, at what-
ever length he likes, according to the tariff of the Lily's advertise-
ment columns. Each proprietor will be at liberty to contribute
drawings, articles, and § to the Lily, and will reserve the right
of criticising the same himself.
The Lily, though meek and drooping, will wage a war of exter-
mination against the scoffing, scurrilous journal known as Punch.
It is finally resolved that the # shall be the only paper allowed
to lie on the tables of the Oxford Union.
“De Mortuis,” &c.
Thomas CARLYLE is dead and buried. . Dean STANLEY called him

CARLYLE is said to have called Dean STANLEY an old body-snatcher.
CARLYLE used, the English language, with a force and eccentricity
that was happily peeuliar to himself, but it is more than doubtful if
he said half the things which were attributed to him in his lifetime.
If he did say them, it would certainly be better now to let them be
forgotten. He had a very poor opinion of GE9RGE ELIOT's powers.
CARLYLE was something more than a rude old gentleman, with a

“DUCKS." AT DURHAM.
CAMBRIDGE is going to admit
Ladies to the Tripos Examina-
tions, and Oxford will one day
have to imitate the liberality of
the sister University by the side
of the sluggish Cam. But more
startling news comes from the
North. Cambridge is not going
to grant degrees, so that the
“Sweet Girl Graduate” would
be an unrealised dream, were it
not that Durham has come to the
rescue. The little University
nestling under the shadow of that
great Cathedral of St. Cuthbert
which looks so majestically down
upon the Wear, is chivalrously
coming forward to allow the
young lady of the day to write
the magic letters “B.A.” after
her name, and in due time, we
suppose, to proceed to a Master's
degree. An application has been
made to the Senate of Durham
University to allow women to
compete for entrance Scholarships
and to take a degree in Arts. If
this is carried out, and it is said
that there is every chance of it,
we shall, see a reform, indeed.
Saint Cuthbert's rest will be dis-
turbed by the silvery laughter of
lady Undergraduates, and the
host of the venerable Bede will
on the look-out to prevent
flirtations between the fair scho-
lars and their masculine competi-
tors. And when the Ladies go to
Durham, won’t there be a e
increase in the number of male

THE GO-TO-BED QUESTION.
It is a great relief to Londoners
to hear that the new Licensing
Bill, said to be cut and dried in a
pigeon-hole of the Home Office,
is efficially stated to be a rumour
“without foundation.” A new
Licensing Bill that would ho-
nestly grapple with a t social
question, that would destroy the
worship of the Sacred Jackass at
Clerkenwell, and take theregula-
tion of º: amusements out of
the hands of a mob of reactionary
Nincomformists, would do some-
thing for the most Dismal City in
the world. Such a Bill, however,
was never stated to have been in
existence. Our governors were
said to be contemplating another
curtailment of perso liberty
under which no London tavern
was to be kept open after eleven
o'clock at night. A return to
the curfew-bell system would, no
doubt, be agreeable to certain
Nincomformist fanatics, but the
country, we hope, is y in
the humour for more Puritanical
restriction. The Liberal Party
will probably find out, one of
these days, that the Nincomform-
ist party are not their best allies,

thing more than pay taxes and go

It has been hard work, Sir, recently for the Old Man, keeping up
with Her Imperial and Royal Majesty, ELIZABETH AMALIE EUGENIE,
º of Austria and Queen of Hungary, over the whole county
of Cheshire, to say nothing of the Dukeries, the Weald of Kent, the
Lake Country—(ah! what a splendid run that was over Scarsdale

swimming right across Windermere, left us all, including myself

Château-Lafitte. I never spare my Château-Lafitte.” “You spared
it, my Lord Field-Marshal,” I answered, with a low bow, “in 1814

sion of Peninsular heroes.” Aha! I had him there! Fine old

Nothing more thoroughly superb and bang-up, and highgeewoa-

itself was of the cheeriest I have ever known ; and we woke up the
saltpits, I can tell you, considerably. ...I headed the first fox for at
least four miles. I cºuld hear the din of the couteauz de chasse,

The individuality of the gifted pavement-decoratºr

exhibition of the Whistler Pastels in New Bond Street,
and of Mr. Burne-Jones's Sea Nymph at the Grosvenor,
the original genius that has so long adorned our flag-
stones cannot henceforth remain a mystery;. The hands
of the masters are evident; the labouris divided. Mr.
Whistler, the Pastelthwaite of Bond Street, sketches
the subjects, which are first suggested and then touched
up by the inimitable BURNE-Jones. We do not ourselves
wish to trade on this discovery, though we are aware
there are “millions in it.” & wish to do Messrs. W.

A DISSOLVING WIEW OF THE POLYTECHNIC,
It is rumoured that the Polytechnic is about to pass into new
hands, when the present entertainments will be discontinued.
Under these circumstanges, it is not improbable that the following
“Catalogue of the Sale” will be issued:–
The “Ghost Secret,” including working Comic Skeleton and
Spectre to illustrate a reading of Hamlet. -
Dissolving Views of “Taking of Seringapatam,” capitally adapted
for Lectures on the Zulu, Ashantee, or § Campaigns:
Job lot of Chemicals for producing “Brilliant Experiments,” with
their accompanying Perfumes. ----
Gigantic Electrical Machine, capable of killing an elephant.
Useful, lot for an old gentleman ordered a “mild galvanic treat-

shooters, and nuts on an Easter Monday, Capital rostrum for an
unpopular Candidate at a contested Election.

thousand times #. the Diver. -
The Diver's Helmet, curiously indented by rapping pennies on
the top. Useful for Antiquarians.
The Diving-Bell, licensed to hold six comfortably, might be
converted into a lift, a summer-house, or, with machinery, crane,
air-pump, &c., would form an endless source of instructive enter-

THE MILLAIS-NIUM IN NEW BOND STREET.
THE MILLAIs Collection is to be seen in the room adjoining the
one where our friend, PASTELTH waſte, exhibits his blotting-paper
studies; and he has taken a leaf out of Punch's book to add to his
own laurel crown, by framing our illustrated review of his artistic
eccentricities. On this same page occurred a poem entitled “Io
Triumphe ' " !, and Mr. Whistºr has pasted a sheet of tinted
letter-paper & º, over the poem, but left the “IoTriumphel” as
note of ju- bilation." He might now change it from “Io
º, !” into “I pay triumphe l’’ as the sale of the
Whist LER ‘’’ effects—we mean the Pastels—has been mar-
wellously remunerative; so that, on the whole, as, compared with
ourselves and the purchasers, he certainly has the best of the joke,
—the best “by chalks.” . But let us pass from the “Jim” to the
“Jem” Collection, i.e. that of J. E. MILLAIs pictures. It is a
rfect history of his art, from Strawberries in March, 1851, to
ipe Cherries in December, 1880. A converted Pre-Raphaelite makes
the best artist. Ask for a glass—there is no refreshment-room, but
should Mr. J. Jopling be present, he will courteously provide you
with the glass required, avery powerful one, a glass which clears, but
does not inebriate, and by its aid you can examine the marvels of
the pre-Raphaelite painting as shown in Mr. MILIAls' early wºrks
when he used his brush on each particular hair of the human head
with such care and attention as only a TRUEFIT or a Douglas—who
beards you in his own den in Bond Street-could show, and gave the
texture of cloth or tweed so faithfully that an experien tailor
could have priced the stuff for trousers at a glance.
No. 5-Here he took a sacred subject, a touching tradition well
known to the earliest Christian artists, and,*...; just so much
of the old familar symbolism as would appeal to poetic sentiment, he
brushed away i. like cobwebs, and gave us, the muscular
Christian's view, in A.D. 1849, of a beautiful legendary episode of
A.D. 10.

his identity is not altogether lost in his new character—which is not

belief that he was tackling the Government.

Tuesday Night.—Millennium suddenly turned on, and before quite
knew where we were, found ourselves with arms round each other's
necks. The lion is iying down with the lamb, that is to say, the
HoNE SECRETARY is sitting on the front Opposition Bench, cheerily
chatting with Sir Richard CRoss. If any of useould find a cocka-
trice's den we should certainly go and put our hands on it.
In this happy condition of affairs we are voting the public money
in a manner excessively pleasing. No one would be so far at vari-
ance with the prevailing mood, as to ask inconvenient whys or
untimely wherefores. PETER, who used to look after the national
pence, sits pensive in his corner seat. Mr. Monck has retreated
within his cell. Mr. DILwYN is regarding with astonishment the
figure he cut yesterday. Once Sir ANDREw Lusk rose, and putting
his head on one side, after the manner of an interrogatory parrot,
“wanted to know.” But his voice sounded so hollow that he scarcely
recognised it, and sat down marvelling. Mr. CALLAN, ruddier than

but nothing that would delay the pro-
ress of business. Mr. A. M. SULLIVAN

Why should the House finish its work so
early the gay and festive Member for
Chatham inquires. Committee had been
at work for seven hours it is true; but
Mr. GoRST has not. Insists upon an
answer to his question. Hints at some
deep design on the part of the PREMIER, in not putting down more
votes. Fresh question of privilege looming in the near horizon. Per-
turbation on the Treasury Bench. Shall they yield, and get up a few
special votes which Mr. GoRST may discuss to himself at midnight?
“He is as bad as Oliver Twist,” said, Mr. GLADsroNE, gloomily
ºf this disturber of the evening's peace, as he stood at the
corner of the gangway. - -
“Worse,” said Sir wnlºw HARcourt. “Oliver Twist at least
disposed of what he had, before he asked for more. GoRst comes here

Business done.-Remainder of Supplementary Votes agreed to.
Thursday Night.-Greece and Turkey seem to be coming to blows,
º in the Transvaal are reaching a point of acute interest,
and Mr. CHILDERs has ready another speech on the Army Estimates.
But none of these things occupy the mind of the House. #. question
is, Is our LoRD MAYOR safe? Happily, he escaped the first shock, and
after the Common Council had welcomed his arrival with enthusi-
astic cheers and expressions of heartfelt gratitude at his deliverance,
sºme one put an inconvenient question. Was the Lord MAYok at the
Mansion House at the time?" Thus unexpectedly interrogated, the
LoRD MAYor admitted he was not, and enthusiasm subsided.
Since then º: to think there was a mistake. Must have been
there, and saved only by the dauntless courage of the City police,
else why should he be cheered in the crowded streets, or why this
absorbing interest in the House? Came injust now with light and
graceful step and countenance tuned to gravity of situation. Some
one observes there is a smell of gunpowder. Lord Mayor looks con-
scious, and audibly whispers that this was not the coat he had on at
the time. Everyone crowds round the Lond Mayor and shakes his
hand. Some talk of giving him a medal for personal bravery. He
begins to think that the policeman was a #. and that it was he

gunpowder, and the LoRD MAYoh's cheek pales at the thought.

AN ASTROLOGER'S FLUKE.
*OUR friend ZADKIEL, however, has very nearly made a good shot.
His “Voice of the Stars” for March predicted that:—
“The Czar will be in some personal danger about the 6th instant.”
This, if ZADRIEL in his Almanac had said nothing further about
the Sovereign assassinated on the 13th instant, would certainly have
looked like, at least, not a very wide miss of the buil's eye.
But the Stars say more in ZADKIEL's prophetic pages. Hear their
“Woice” again vaticinating in May:—
“The Czar of Russia will gain by the transit of Jupiter over his sun's
place, but Saturn is hovering near the same place also: hence danger will
attend any advancement j by the greater fortune.”
In the meanwhile the Stars of ZADKIEL had omitted to mention
that the Czar of RUssíA they referred to the second time would be
not ALEXANDER THE SECOND, but ALEXANDER THE THIRD. More-
over, they aver that in June:–
“Saturn transits on the 13th instant, the place of the Sun at the birth of
the CzAR, and Mars squares his ascendant on the 28th; this will be a dan-
gerous month for the Autocrat; his armies will meet with defeat.”
They next announce a “Conjunction of Mars and Saturn” to take
place in Taurus on the 6th of July, and declare thereof:—
“To the Czar of Russia, it is ominous of defeat and personal danger, and
he will do well to prepare for the dread summons.”
Lastly, ZADKIEL prevents any doubt whatsoever touching whom he
calls the “Czar of Russia” by publishing in his Almanac, page 58,
among, “Nativities of Eminent Personages,” the nativity of that
same Eminent Personage. He, firstly, gives a table of “Primary
Directions,” beginning with February, 1881, and ending with No-
yember. To thºse he adds "Transits in 1881? ; the first of which
is remarkable indeed:—
“April 1st, Saturn in sextile to the Moon's radical place.”
Let the First of April by all means be the fête of ZADKIEL and his
believers.
THE EARTH REVOLVES ON ITS TAXES,
THE real aim, ambition, and function of Governments of all kinds
is not to legislate, much less to reform, but to tax, and tax, and tax
again. For this purpose the Conservative, Lion, lies down with the
Liberal Lamb, a fussy atom, like the Fourth Party ceases to be fussy
and offensive, and even the mob of so-called Members, who represent
themselves first and St. Giles afterwards, give º for a time, their
policy of obstruction, and do all they can to bleed the hated Šaxon.
As a good substantiaiparish dinner—paid for, of course, by the rate-
payers—heals all the differences and heart-burnings of Bumbledom,
so a Committee of Supply in the House of Commons stops orations,
personalities, scenes, and discord. . Vote after vote is passed with
that pleasing unanimity which is held to distinguish the actors in
the Critic, and not a thought is given to those measures which are
either promised in the Queen's Speech, or initiated in the course of
Parliamentary discussion. - -
The difference between the º: and the legislator is this:
the tax-payer, as a worker, has to do his work before he is paid; the
legislator, as a worker, likes to be paid before he does his work. As
early as possible in the Session the Supply business and Budget are
got through, and then, after a refreshing Easter holiday, begins the
breaking of Parliamentary pledges. Measures of reform are intro-
duced with a languid air, to be put on one side for the Derby Day,
and after this great festival of legalised betting, the Government
Official begins to sharpen his knife for the usual “Massacre of the
Innocents”—the greatest innocents being the tax-payers. If #.
were left, as it ought to be left, to the end of the Session, and then
voted according to the work done and not the work promised, the
taxation would not only be lighter, but the legislation would be
much more speedy and effective.
A FRUITFUL SEssron —The Session will not be altogether barren,
as one reform is promised—Postage Stamps and Receipt. Stamps are
to be one and the same thing. This is a useful and obvious.gon-
cession, butletus hope that the Government will not stick at trifles.

The Earl of B-c-nsf-ld to Sir W. P. H-re-rt.
MY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,
SINCE circumstances, as much beyond the limits of my
conception as outside the region of my control, have consigned me
to the decorous diness of the "illustrious and ancient House,” I
have, believe me, watched the progress of one career in that “other
place,”, the memory of which I still respectfully cherish, with a
sympathy and solicitude jº. as decisive as they have been
indefinite. But why should I fall back, in a private communication
such as this, upon the phantasmagoria of phrase ? When making
my exodus from that crowd, where the brutalities of debate, if
obvious, were at least sufficiently spiced with some personal pun-
gency, I º to fear that I had entered into the dignity that
waited me above without remembering to let fall my mantle, upon
other shoulders as I passed from below. But I am immensely re-
assured. The vigorous and malignant satire, once supposed to be my
special possession and privilege, has, so my parliamentary reading
informs me, by no means passed away, as the powerful poetaster
now rising among us expresses it, “ º, an evil dream.” If I was
once the Nepaul pepper of the Commons, you are now their Can-
tharides. y dear Sir WILLIAM, let me congratulate you. M
mantle has not Fº fallen on your shoulders—it has *loº
your head. And this brings me to the subject-matter of my letter.
You have, I take it, been paying me that highest court—the court
of imitation; and flattered as I am to the full by this sincere homage,
I cannot I feel more exhaustively acknowledge the compliment than
by adding a few hints that º: beneficial to you in your new rôle.
o begin with, My dear Sir WILLIAM, remember that if you are
sharp you may, at least, be shallow: and that to be accurate is not
so essential as to be acute. I do not know whether, the exigencies
of party being eliminated, we differ deeply—say on the question of
Candahar; but, diverging or in sympathy, we can, at least, take it
as an illustration for instruction. º: do I know of Candahar?
I know that in the columns of the daily papers it is usual to spellit
with a “C,” but here my intimate acquaintance with it begins and
ends. I have heard of Ghuznee. I have heard of Merv. North-
BRook tells me that I must not confound the latter with Margate:
and there is some reasonableness in this suggestion. I cannot sa
that I have ever confounded it absolutely with Margate: but
should be sorry to have to point out its exact position on the shores
of the Caspian. And do I know in the least where the Caspian is to

effectively in the ears of those who look to me for the frontier, the
Scientific Frontier, which that City dinner presented to me suddenly
as a revelation, and in which, LYTTON, the anchorite and enthusiast
of geogra hical rectification ihas believed devoutly and divinely ever
since. I have, I think, in the respectable rhapsody of a Lords' de-
bate, referred to Candahar as the Gibraltar of the Indus. . This was
when I had pictured it washed by the, blue waters of the Sea of
Aral. Now that I hear it is about four hundred miles from any-
where, I should rather describe it as the Rosherville of the Caucasus.
Some day I may come across it in a map, and then, some new dis-
covery as to its precise location may inspire me with a fresher and
flashier phrase. The Billingsgate of Bokhara sounds well. But do
not let me, my dear Sir WILLIAM, be misunderstood. I am not be-
yond facts. i. only above them. I would rather ape the man-
nerisms of a matured mystic than attain mediocrity as a master of
mere matter of fact. We may diverge Fº but we have
much in common. We both have succumbed to the seductive plea-
sure that may be summed up in those two words “to startle and to
.." There is an ancient Assyrian proverb that says—but never
mind. I think we understand each other. Meantime, should yºu
doubt my candour, let mere-assure you. Let me put my “Scientific
Frontier” on paper. Here you are:-

zine; (3) Site for the Statue of Empress; (4), Projected Military Rºd;

Monsieur MüNTz, a Professor and Chemist profound,
Has got absolute alcohol out of the ground.
He finds some of it even in soils that are poor,
But from rich and fat mould has extracted much more.
He detects it in river, in spring, and in rain,
Not only in cistern, but likewise in main,_
That is, in the waves of the ocean, you know.
He has alcohol found present even in snow.
He says that he thinks, though he can't as yet swear,
That as vapour 'tis like to exist in the air;
In short, he makes out, go wherever you will,
You'll at hand have materials for working a still.
From it none but the purest spring water is free,
Wherewithal shall Teetotallers, then, brew their tea?
So the spirit which Nature pervades, as divine
Bards and Sages have said, is the spirit of wine.
To matters organic it owes its production,
Through decomposition in states of destruction,
From various causes of chemical action,
Whence comes fermentation—in short, putrefaction.
As the microscope, showing a water-drop rife,
In minute animalcules, with animal life,
Disgusted the Brahmin, how Chemistry must

DIARY OF A REPORTER.
“Additional precautions have been taken for the safety of the Houses of

issued requiring any visitor or stranger carrying bags or parcels to submit to
an examination of the same before entering the precincts of either House. All
arrangements are made under the personal supervision of Sir EDMUND HEN-

shows how liable we are to misunderstand people. At a time when in
the House of Commons Sir RICHARD CRoss was trumpeting forth the
great battle-cry of “British, Interests,” there was a fearsome
skeleton in the cupboard, at the Home Office. When I say there
was a skeleton in the cupboard, I mean there were two feet of sewage
in the cellars...Whilst we were thinking of the Home Secretary in
Cabinet Council arranging with his colleagues the fate of Empires,
he was actually sitting in his office with a large bottle of smelling-
salts under his nose, inditing a note to the Treasury, informing
them that, if they did not look after the sewage, he would take
lodgings elsewhere, and charge them with the rent.

Now we know what is meant by the “policy of sewage” which
the late Mr. DISRAELI once announced. It means to arrange matters
so that instead of the house-sewage running into the town-drain, the
town-sewage runs into the house. So original, ... worthy
the occasion. Ordinary house may more or less proceed on ordinary
principles; but when you come to the Home Office, the head of the
social government of the country, the embodiment of all its practical
wisdom, then it is necessary to strike out a new line, and give a new
turn toºyour sewage. Everyone delighted with the discovery. All

CHRISTOPHER SLY AT THE PRINCESS’S.
HERE we witnessed such an indifferent performance of The Mer-
chant of Venice as might do for a Booth, and would, if often repeated,
“do” effectually for a first-class London theatre. The American tra:
gedian has his admirers, and it seems that Mr. IRVING is one of them,
as he has engaged his Transatlantic cousin to lay with him at the
Lyceum. The prices are to be doubled; it strikes us they should be
ved, and a liberal discount for eash allowed to everyone visiting the
theatre when Mr. Booth plays either Hamlet, or Shylock, or Petruchio.
It was, alas, our fate to witness the greater part of Ratherine and
Petruchio: Heavens ! what an extravagant, pantomimical, senseless
absurdity! Only HANLoN-LEEs, the Pantomimists, and a couple of
very ordinary burlesque actors, could do justice to this creation of the
Bard's, which, had it been the work of a modern dramatic author,
would most assuredly have been hissed off the stage. But after all,
perhaps, SHAKSPEARE only intended it for Christopher Sly's delecta-
tion; and the tinker went to sleep in the middle of the first scene.
Mr. Booth as Petruchio reminds us forcibly both in face, and
voice, and manner, of the late Mr. DEwAR when made up, not for
%. Crosstree, but for some part in a domestic comedy.
* Qne merit we must concede, to Mr. Booth, he is a master of dis-
guise. It was almost impossible to recognise in Petruchio the man
who had but twenty minutes before appeared as Shylock. We wish
it had been somebody else. But professional entertainers, can rival
him in this, and at the Gallery of Illustration the two ALFREDs—
Messrs. REED & BISHOP–can do as much, and more.
Mr. Booth's style of acting seems to us to be several generations
behind the time. CHARLEs Young and the KEMBLEs wouldn't
have a chance now; rolling the eyes, elevating the eyebrows (but
not the audience), and twitching of the fingers, are the stock-in-
trade of a few travelling Crummleses; unless, along with grow >
untings, grumblings, and *::::: of the breast, even these old-
#. signals of distress have §º: with the MACREADY
tradition, and with the last of the old school, Mr. PHELPs.
IRVING, “with all thy faults we love thee still!”—“still!”. Yes,
“still IRWING” is preferable to IRVING in movement; and he's not
often “moving.” But why on earth—well, our Tragedian is a 'cute
cuss to extend his hand to the Yankee. Consummatell

So an Eminent Judge wouldn't recognise an Eminent Entertainer
last week! What is this I hear of some difficulty about a “trick
wig ’f Surely mere hair-splitting oughtn't to part old friends.
Is it a fact that the engagement between the sporting Captain
—we need not mention his name—and a beautiful and noble heiress
has been broken off owing to a dispute about settlements.
Why does Jo Miller wear a white hat? I think a certain fair
equestrian in the “Row" can answer this question.
If (as it is whispered) the late popular Baronet committed
bigamy when he married his acknowledged widow, it seems probable
that there may be a change in the succession to the Estates.
A story is going the round that the stout Major-General, whose
face is so familiar at the B. & S. Club, ran away from the enemy
and concealed himself in a ditch until the fighting was over, at the
battle for which he received one of his most cherished medals. The
Committee of the B. & S. Club should look into this.
There are reasons for believing that, an eminent physician, a
leading Q.C., M.P., one of the most brilliant ornaments of the Bar,
and the genial and deservedly popular Head Master of one of our
most ancient scholastic establishments, will retire immediately from
the labours of their professions. It is said that softening of the
brain is the cause of this sudden abandonment of their active duties.

inless than an hour he hit upon him, and so saved 4 pair of stairs

what made him so long, and he said Mr. GUBBINs was so very busy
he couldn't be shorter. The Gent then said he hoped he’d grow
quicker, but WILLIAM said he hoped he shouldn't or he might out-
ow his strength. The Gentleman laughed and acshally gave
#. another shilling. I’ve known him wait at the corner of a road
for nearly an hour, hoping something would cum by and give him a
lift, altho he had only about a mile to go. That Boy will do. He has
all the rekisites for a first-class Waiter. We think of dressing him |
like a Page, to assist me, and his Mother thinks it would be a pretty
idear to put sixpences on his jacket instead of buttons; she thinks
they would be so suggestive. WILLIAM's maxim is, never be in a

CHICAGO-NY.
SARAH is the Tenth Muse and the Fourth Grace, with a good deal
of Madame the Admirable Crichton thrown in; but really her
manners are not improved by travel. Compelled to give “levées” d
la Martin Chuzzlewit, in order to attract people to her Art-exhibi-
tions (one bust, one statuette, and two paintings), she revenges her-
self by º abusing, in French, all the sightseers who cannot
understand the language. Her friend and fellow-traveller, the Cor-
respondent of the Voltaire, chuckles patriotically over her remarkto a
cago merchant who gave her a diamond: “Not bad for a
butcher!” and the gracious consolation offered to a poor enthusiast
who had half-killed two horses driving thirty miles to see her:
“Perhaps the old hunks thinks I am going to replace his screws.”

great English tenor for having
such thoroughly English bron-

by his being so unfortunately
delicate; and, be it remem-
bered, so does he. Probably
up to the last moment he is
#. to make an effort, but
oresees that if he does the
result may be serious. Is it
absolutely impossible to an-
nounce that Mr. SIMs REEVEs
will “positively” sing on such
and such a night? Instead of
a Simmer we got a BoyLE, who
was highly satisfactory, though
he didn't sing anything from
his well-known Court Guide.

at last succeeded in making it

muck—the Market, or Muckit,
as it is called, is new, after a
long struggle, taxed at some-
thing like areasonable amount.
For years it was let off too
cheaply at a so-called rateable
value of £4200 a-year, and
now it is assessed at a still too
moderate rateable value of
£10,000 a-year. This is not
much for a central area like
Mud-Salad Market, and no-

a e or two of public tho-

days a week, in the best part of
the day, are blocked up with
waggons and vegetable refuse.

ONE-SIDED RULE.
THE Meddlevex Magistrates, having strangled
dancing, more or less, within the wretched limits
of their more wretched jurisdiction, are now
turning their attention to more sacred things,
and doing all they can to smother the Messiah.
There are animals that have ears for everything
but music, and the animal with the exceptionally
of the Sessions-House, Clerkenwell, has been
known to bray wildly in the presence of harmony.
Even the decorous dulness which generally dis-
tinguishes oratorios has failed to have a soothing
effect upon the Six Hundred Irresponsibles, who
usually sympathise with dulness, and they have issued an official
warning that if any “sacred music” is played in any building,
licen by them, on Good Friday, that building will in future be
deprived of all authority as a concert or ºn.ii.
uckily for the , cause of sobriety, and decent, recreation, the
area misgoverned by, the Six Hundred Irresponsibles, is not the
whole of London. While.more, sensible counselsº in Surrey
and Kent, there is a building called the Albert Hall, which boasts of
a Royal Charter. Here the Messiah, shut out of Middlejº, wii

“SCENEs” in the House are mild compared with some recent
doings of the Board of Guardians last Thursday, as reported in the
Islington Gazette of March 25. There was a dispute as to whether
a certain pauper woman was or was not a lunatic. Amid consider-
able confusion the following climax it appears was reached:–
“Mr. BRowN said the Chairman, after hearing that the woman had been
fººd in an asylum, had been running about London with his hat in his
anol.
“The CHAIRMAN (excitedly). No, Sir, on my head; and I don't mind what
you say, you little bantam-cock. I know you to be a iittle venomous wretch.
(Confusion.)”
By way of arriving at some conclusion, the Chairman subsequently
offered to second a vote of censure on himself. After some further
comparatively, tame discussion, the Board proceeded to the next
business, which happened to be a question of providing a Hot-water
apparatus. Not much necessity for that, we j say, or Islington

RHYMES FOR A REASON.
“ATLAs,” in last week's World, said, a
propos of the forthcoming GILBERT-SULLI-
WAN eccentric aesthetic opera, that there is
a rhyme in it to totally "quite worthy of
GILBERT.” This intrigued us... What could
it be? So, as our Office Boy is a rhymes-
ter, we gave him the office, and in less than
ten minutes he had suggested the following
Hºle rhymes to “totally,” commencing
nus :-
* Want a rhyme to tall
With the . & º, • ? "
This we at once told him might have
suited Hudibras, but wasn't worthy of The
Pirates. A trifle abashed, he resumed—
“Huntsman cries “Ho tally
Ho!”—Rhyme to totally.”
Better, we admitted; but couldn't he
get beyond the huntsman? The youthful
Laureate at once replied—
“How a line ends—
Well—much depends
On what's before in the song.
If I said “wrote a lie?
Might rhyme to ‘ totally,’
Would I be totally wrong?”
Better; though, of course, this rhyme
too must be determined by the arbitrary
pronunciation of “totally.”
“The AEsthetics,” suggested our dear
Boy, “are in a wherry, and sing—
‘Utterly, Totally,–
Down the stream boatily l’
“Then on the lawn their repast is laid
out, and they say—
‘We’re not mistaken totally
In serving it table d'hôte-lly.”
“Or Mr. SULLIVAN may complain of a
tenor—
“He who sings throatily
Spoils my song totally.”
“Again,” cried the juvenile CHATTERTON,
jºirecting a traveller who had missed his
road-
“If you would go to Lea,
You are wrong totally l’
“Mr. TooDE might say that a horn was
layed Tootle-ly wrong ; or Mr. D'Oyley
ARTE steerer of the Opéra-Comique Gunn-
boat, might suggest an alliance with another
Captain of another gun-boat—
‘Yours with my boat ally,
We’ll beat 'em totally ſ”
“Miss Dinorah will sing—
* Down here .# goat'll lie
Satisfied totally.”
“An Irishman would ask—
— with his hair fuzzled
* Tell me what coat 'll I
Put on ? I’m totally,
Utterly puzzled.’”
“Or,” exclaimed the Boy, his eye in fine
frenzy rolling, “An inspirationſ I can
emphasise the last two syllables, make it
‘to-tally,” and then—listen!” And in a
jubilant voice he sang out—
**Mister HALL; Danced a ballet.
In a châlet, Out the “tally.”
Lit a “tally.”
Then with SALLY
And his valet
Gene-rally
Went dis-mally.
In ther
Dark to-tally.”
At this point we jumped on him, and sat
on his head till a Composer came round.
He is now composed.
As the new G. and S. Opera is to satirise
the AEsthetes, instead of a “patter” song,
the Author should write a “Pater” song.

ADVICE To PLAYGOERs.
WHEN you enter a theatre without having previously booked your
seat, and are told that the house is full, insist upon having chairs
put in the gangways, and turn a deaf ear to any Managerial objec-
tiºns. When tºld that the form Cººs has issued orders
forbidding such obstructions, tell the Manager, or his representative,
to go to Jericho, and take the Lord CHAMBERLAIN with him. When
the footlights flare above the glasses, or there is the slightest smell
of burning paper of linen, stand up in the body of the house and
shout “Fire l'' as loudly as possible. Having created a panic, and
being directed to outlets that are not altogether familiar to you—
some of them labelled “Exit to be used in case of fire”—insist upon
going out by the entrance ºr entrances you always come in at, and
insist upon going out in the most disorderly manner. Knock over
as many seats as you can find unfixed, upset people who are smaller
and weaker than yourself, and do not hesitate for a moment to
trample on them if they are foolish enough to lie on the floor. If
#. get out safely, and find you have lost a shirt-stud or a pocket-
andkerchief in the struggle, insist upon going back to search for it,
and if anythin º to you, lay the blame upon the Manager,
who is supposed to be “ personally responsible.”
ADVICE To MANAGERs.
BLOCK up, your, passages with, lumber and pot-house bars, and
traps for catching shillings in the shape of coat-rails, umbrella-stands,
opera-glass counters, book-stalls, &c., Put the gas-lights as near the
wall and the ceiling as the lath and plaster will bear without break-
ing out into an immediate blaze, Suspend a chandelier in the middle
of the house over the people's heads, and forbid anyone to examine
its fixings oftener than once in a quarter of a century. Build a car-
penter's shop over this chandelier, and fill it with intº of inflam-
mable materials. Choke up your cellars with shavings, bits of old
scenery, rotten properties—anything that will burn with the slightest
encouragement. Dress up a super in a fireman's uniform to cºmfort
the eye of authority, and º up ten or a dozen |. buckets in a
prominent part of the theatre, to comfort the public and the Insur-
ance Companies. Let the public smoke, if they like, in the lºbbies,
and the workmen smoke, #.they like, in the ji. *ś a
fiddler on the premises in case of fire, so that your building may
perish in a classical manner.
ADVICE To Journ ALISTs.
AFTER the destruction of a theatre in any part of the world, do all
you can to create a general panic. Take no trouble to verify your
statements, but assert boldly that no theatre is a bit safer than the
grater of Vesuvius in the middle of an eruption. When you have
frightened away half the paying audiences from half the theatres,
apply boldly for wholesale free admissions.
ADVICE To THE LICENsing AUTHoRITIES.
RESPECT vested interests, and never interfere with any old theatres,
however badly constructed. With regard to new theatres, give a
licence of exactly the same value to a capitalist who spends £20,000
to make his theatre comfortable and safe, as you give to a capitalist
who expends less than half that amount.
ADVICE to INsu RERs.
Look, into the statistics of theatre-burning, and find how many
houses have been destroyed in the middle of a prosperous run or the
height of the dramatic season.
F--
Millennial Measure.
THERE is now before the House of Commons a project of º:
tion, which promises to put an end to pauperism, empt the
wºrkhouses, and preclude all necessity for any allowance whatsoever
whether of in-door or out-door relief. Evidently at least all these
objects ought to be effected by the enactment of a measure *
extremely comprehensive as the Exemption from Distress Bill.

“HERE stands A Post 1”
Mowday Night, March 28.-How varied are the
works of nature, and yet how uniformly beautiful! To
think that a single family could produce two brothers
like the Hoxſe SECRETARY and the Member for Oxford-
shire. Am told the Colonel is the elder. But apart
from looks and almanacks, should have thought he was
the Home SECRETARY in an earlier stage of development.
He has about him all the rich store of wit, poetry, and
eloquence which flashes forth with easy force when the
How E SECRETARY comes in contact with anybody or
anything. Only it is oddly undeveloped. You can see
that the thoughts burn; but the Colonel cannot get
them easily to breathe. I believe that in his own room,
or standing at the Club window, he makes speeches
that would beat the Home SECRETARY's hollow.
- - - Such subtle turn of phrase, such scathing sarcasm, #FF-3
such blinding wit, were rarely imagined. But when he opens his mouth they all {". inarticulate. The Colonel makes notes on a
small card, which he holds in the palm of his left hand. These are the keys which, touched, should make perfect melody of speech.
The Colonel touches them rightly enough; he punches them, wrenches them, and wrestles with them generally. But only fragmentary
noises, in nowise musical, is the result. Still the intention evident, and design clear. Most excellent speech in everything but words.
Dim notion that by practice the Colonel will get hold of the words, right end up, and will by process of development become equal to the
HomESECRETARY. At present, in respect of well ordered fluency, he falls a trifle short. But the arrangement might be much worse. On
the whole, prefer a man with ideas too big for his words to one with words too many for his ideas.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Business done.—Mutiny Bill read a Second, Time; Colonel HAR-
court's Motion, to make the State pay half the cost of main roads,
defeated on a division by 159 votes against 145.
Tuesday Night.—Mr. BIGGAR wandering about the Bar to-night
making feigned advances on the Chair, suddenly rising and as
abruptly resuming his seat, and by other devices causing to grow
pale the cheek of Mr. AsHTON DILKE, and to add more grey hairs
to the beard of Mr. STEVENSON. These two Gentlemen have been
looking up Decimal Coinage, and have tremendous speeches on hand,
or rather in hat. Mr. STEvenson in particular supplies fresh illus-
tration of what “a working hat.” may be, by bringing his down
literally stuffed with papers. What with the speech burdening his
mind, and this apparition of Mr. BIGGAR with constant threat of a
Count Out, Mr. DILRE more than usually lugubrious.
“Looks as if he had lost a shilling and found a franc,” Sir WIL-
FRED LAWSON says.
..But Mr. BIGGAR was only funning. Finding time hang heavy on
his hands, it occurred to him that he might agreeably spend it in this
way. He meant no harm, and though he º have counted the
House out at any time between seven and ten, he forebore. Perhaps
e knew what was coming, and thought to pay off old scores with an
assembly that has sometimes manifested a passing disinclination to
hear him address it. 40°37 minutes of Mr. DILKE, immediately fol-
lowed by 35'87 minutes of Mr. STEVENson, go a long way towards
settling a balance of penance.
Then there was Mr. HUBBARD. Curiously aggravating juvenes-
cence about Mr. HUBBARD. *...i of grievance on public
grounds that a man of his years should insist upon going about in
an indecorous shooting - coat, and
should array himself in parti-
coloured neckties, just as if he
were forty-five. r. RAMsAY, a
entleman of vast research, hints,
in a blood-freezing way, that there
is some mystery about the Lord-
Advocate...It's all very well, he
observes with an appalling nod of
the head, to say that the Gentle-
man who recently retired from the
representation of Edinburgh was
the father of the Right Hon. Gentle-
man who now sees that Scotland
stands where it did.

and you will see at a glance which

. Mr. RAMSAY not a man given to
joking. Fancy there must be some-
thing in this. Mr. ABNQLD fond of
asking questions. Set him to ask
the Home SECRETARY. Son or sire,
and if so, why?
Much the same thing about the
two HUBBARDS. Member for Cit
currently regarded, as Father HUBBARD, but in appearance *:

dinging, claymores clashing, the air full of guttural sound. Left
the House for a few minutes at half-past eleven; everything quiet,
eyen dull; Back at a quarter to twelve, and found the fiery-cross
already half-way round. HARcourt grasping. LORD-ADvocate

sumed to tickle his legs?, Qr had the market for pease-meal brose

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER,
My wust fears is Realeyesed
The LoRD MARE if not quite a Tea Toeteller is suttenly a Tem-
rancer. He wanted to have for his Chapling Doctor PUNCH'EM the
Welshlean, and to ebolish his Trumpitters, but the Court of Alder-
men came to the reskew. They sed, and werry properly, “You must
draw the line sumwheres, my Lord, and we draws it for you at Chap-
lings and Trumpits.” # own says, “Why not at CHAPLING and
HoRNs,” but he’s always saying sum rubbitch or other. After giving
the matter dew considerashun, I’m inclined to think as a Chapling
is about as good a judge of a dinner as anyboddy. I knows on, let
alone even a Alderman. But then of course there’s Chaplings and
Chaplings. A Lord Mare's Chapling is all werry well #. #. 12
short munse as he lasts, but only to think of the awful change wen
he returns to his own Homely Fair! whereas a Chapling to a grate
Citty Gill is a Chapling for ever, and lives like one all his life. They
allers gives me a smilin nod of recognishun knowing as I shall pay
'em special attension.
But to return to my LoRD MARE. Well, I've bin engaged in m
perfeshnal, dooties now for a good many years, but I never sea suc
things at the horsepital Manshun House as I’ve seen lately. We’ve
had one of them prettyest of all pritty, sites a Children's Party,
without no dancing. e’ve had dredful dull dinners without, no
ladies to sing, and sollem evenin partys without nothink to eat but
Tea! And on every occashun such a lot of reverend-looking Gents,
without no Shirt fronts in pertickler, that everybody seemed quite
afraid to larf.
Qf course if the gents of my perfeshun, who’s engaged there, likes
a change, they’ve suttinly got it, but I dowt if they quite apreshe-
ates it, or we should never have heard of such a downright awful
staggerer as this. Two on 'em has acshally applied to be made into

The names that they can boast of sound, you’ll say, extremely comical,
But you must learn themere you try to ease our aches and pains,

Sword and Umbrella Department. Sentimental Order,
No. 24,000,000,487.
THE “Cat” having been happily abolished through-
out, the British Army, the following regulations for
dealing with serious offences will come into force
immediately:-
1. A Soldier who has misbehaved himself in the face
of the enemy by abject cowardice, or by being drunk
and incapable when acting as a sentry on active service,
shall, be liable to carry extra articles on the line of
… march under certain specified restrictions, that is to
Sav-
A. He #all be authorised to have someone told off to help him
when he complains of fatigue.
B. He shall be allowed strong beef-tea and other “hospital
comforts” on making application to the doctor.
C. The weight of the extra, articles shall be fixed by a Com-
mittee of Lady Members of the Royal Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, and other kindred institutions.
2. A Mutineer who has escaped to the enemy, and been recaptured,
may be tied to a cart or a horse in cases of supreme emergency.
When this particularly harsh course is pursued, however, it must
be clearly understood–
A. That the prisoner may demand that a large easy-chair
shall be carried in the cart for his private use when suffering
from fatigue. - - -
B. That he shall have permission to ride on the horse to
which he is attached, whenever he pleases.
C. That the speed of both cart and horse shall be at all times
strictly regulated by the prisoner's wishes.
It is to be hoped that when the above humanitarian regulations
(so thoroughly calculated to maintain discipline in the Army) have
been #.y established, that the British Public will at last be
satisfied. By order of the Civilian M.P.'s.

As the demigod did that Stymphalian crew.
But cheer up ! They’re provided for pro tem. at least;
Can't promise your platter, old boy, will be full,
But when they and their like have been fed, though your feast
Won't be rich, you may find there’s a bit left for BULL.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
COURT CARDS.
MADAME MopjesRA's Juliet is just the sort of experienced young
person one would expect to result from the early neglect of a vain
weak, handsome mother, Lady Capulet (Miss GIFFARD), who had
shirked her maternal ºn. by confiding the child to such a
repulsively wicked elderly woman as the Nurse, whom Miss LE
THIERE has contrived to divest of any redeeming quality of humour.
Whether SHARspeARE meant to incul-
cate “Spare the nurse, and spoil the
child” as the moral to mothers from
this play of Romeo and Juliet is not
mentioned by his commentators, and
may probably, therefore, be the point
of the piece since so many erudite
muddle-heads have overlooked it.
Genius being above rules of con-
struction—so much insisted upon
nowadays, and so little understood—
the action of this play is wearisome,
and Madame MoDJEskA does little to
relieve it. Her art is evident ; she
is all actress; self-conscious, incon-
sistent, disappointing. Once, in the-
atrical slang, she “gets a curtain,” but it is a bed-curtain which she
brings down with a run after drinking the potion that ought not to
have caused her a pang, but which clearly gives her such fits as to
excite in the audience a feeling of resentment against the respectable
Friar Lawrence (Mr. RYDER, of course), or rather against what
seems to be Friar Lawrence’s “Sell.”
Mr. FoEBEs Robertson, though decidedly good in a great"deal,
makes Romeo too much of a
hybrid between an effeminate
aesthete, and the modern
* Good Young Man” of
Exeter Hall proclivities. How
so gay and gallant a ruffler,
so witty and dashing a man-
about-town as Mercutio could
ever have “consorted" with
such a mawkish, die-away,
priggish, badly-dressed youth
as this Romeo, it is difficult
to imagine.
With the exception of the
Rev. Mr. RyDEnt, known in
stage religion as Friar
Lawrence, Mr. WILson BAR-
fºrt's fiferºuti, is the best -
played part in the piece. Of course this characteris always popular;
the more so, as, strangely enough, he is not absolutely essential to the
plot; indeed, he seems to have been thrown in either because there
was an actor in SHARspEARE's company who would have been gettin
a salary for walking about and doing nothing unless provided wit
something in the new piece, or the Bard was inspired with the Queen
Mabidea, and had to create a person in whose mouth the lines might
be appropriately placed,
who could make his mark
as an eccentric character
part, and be then killed off
to the great regret of all
who had seen his chivalrous
}º and heard his bril-
liant discourse. “Whom
the gods love die }º.

balt (Mr. PRICE) to fight so

at º: is badly man-
aged, and so is the entire
“scrimmage” scene, which,
but for Mercutio making a
first-rate end and “dyin
game,” would be singularly
ineffective.
If Mr. WILson-BARRETT
suggests the stout heart and the pluck of Mercutio in his dying
moments, his thoughtfulness for his page is a touch of the
man's kindly nature. Mercutio was a “real, good fellow,”—
and his slightly impatient, “A *** o' both your houses”
sounds rather like a regret for his own meddling than a re-
proach to Romeo, through whose fault he has met his death, and
who has nothing more consoling to say to his dying friend than that

United States, and a standing disgrace to the nation; and, fourthly,
he is going to reform the Civil Service: Bravo, GARFIELD! Punch

to think that France is going to establish an

England. What I can't get over is the
awful abomination of thinking of annexing
anything ! It is an iniquity I can scarcely
contemplate in the abstract, much less con-
ceive our old ally capable of perpetrating it.
They say they don't intend annexation;
but I myself know, how easily one is led to

integrity of the Turkish Empire, which we
never could see attacked—ahem! again. In

Fine chance of trying in corpore vill, if we

Don't intend to hurt a hair of the BEY’s

Transvaaling on our own account, it isn't
Turkey will deter us, nor England neither;

best prevent us taking our African Alsace

Re-adjustment of Taxation.
(Suggestions for the consideration of the Chan-
cellor of the Exchequer.
DoN'T tax the pay of Soldiers and Sailors.
Reduce the tax on the hardly-earned
incomes of such real ..º.º. as Jour-

Tax the Three “L’s”—Legacies, Land,

Tax photographs, menu cards, and every
dinner-bill above a certain sum.
Tax heavily all advertisements; and ver
heavily all picture-posters on the walls an
wooden structures, &c.
So as to avoid taxing thrift, let the rule
be, as regards the last-mentioned form

hoardings.”

am told º up in the vestry line of public business. Certainly
a good deal of the vestry style of eloquence in his Parliamentary
Inanner. º: making interminable speeches about twopence
which descanted upon by the hour at a time in a level voice, an
with imperturbable manner not exciting.
House owes ARTHUR long grudge, but cleared off to-night. Hap-
pened at dinner time. O'DonnELL on his legs descanting at large on
the iniquities of the Government. Not

Thursday Night.—Everyone, grieved
and shocked to discover that designing
men have been imposing upon the simpli-
city of RANDolph. If RANDolph has a fault it is the tendency to
submit his judgment to that of other men. So retiring, modest, and
ingenuous! Just the sort of man to be taken in by a . of simulated
sorrow or a narrative of fabricated grief.
PHYSIcAL Force-TER.
Business done.—House Counted Out at
It appears that a short time ago distinguished Conservative agent
called and told RANDolph that Sir CHARLEs DILKE and Mr. BRAssEY
were at the back of the Freiheit. Mr. BRASSEY had temporarily ham-
pered his considerable fortune by ad-
vances, whilst Sir CHARLEs DILKE had
been obliged to smoke smaller cigars of
an inferior brand.
“Dear me,” said RANDolph, his
ingenuous eyes wide open with amaze-
ment at this information. “This must
be looked into. Members of the Ministry.
Left wing. Radical plot. BRADLAUGH
in it, I daresay. Part of a Government
scheme to remove Crowned heads, and
dock perpetual pensions.”
A month ago RANDOLPH would have
issued a summons for a Cabinet Coun-
cil, and the whole powers of the Fourth
Party would have been brought to bear
on the case. No Fourth Party now.
Bill for the Limitation of Recovery of
Small Debts broke that up. RANDoIPH

nows him well; might be even the
right thing to do. But private friend-
ship cannot stand in the way of public
duty. If DILKE got wind of the discovery,
he would burn his papers. BRASSEY had already left the country.
“Our Capitol must be saved,” said RANDolph, meditatively
feeling in the wrong place for the end of
his moustache. “It was saved once before
by cackling. I will cackle.”
So the dear boy came down to the House,
and cast into its unsuspecting midst notice
of a question on the subject. House,
which knows RANDOLPH, laughed; Ger-
many, which knows him not, looked grave.
Now to-night turns out to be a ridiculous
hoax. RANDoLPH can afford much from
the wealth of his nature, but he cannot
afford to be laughed at. Resolves to turn
over a new leaf. This ingenuous mind,
this modest mien, this hesitating speech,
this deference to elders, and this readiness
to assume that people know better than he,
will, not do. RANDOLPH is glad Recess is
coming just now to cover his discomfiture.
When the House meets again he will be a
changed man. --- -

NOGGINS OF NECTAR,
(A Song of the Smock-Frock.)
[“Besides what I have said on their case, I must also refer to another case,
to the case of those who are better known as Burton brewers, to whom we are
indebted for providing us with one of the best beverages ever produced
since nectar went out of fashion.”—Mr. Gladstone on the Beer-Taz as
affecting Brewers.]
BILL, GLADSTONE all we, mates, med prize and exalt,
çonsider'n twuz he took the dooty off Malt.
. What naaishun fools we wuz l’” the Torees must swear,
Fur to let un gie we chaps the goo-by, so, there !”
The love o' malt liquor BILL owns to ; for hear
In his Budget spache how a cried up Burton Beer ;
Said we owed them there Brewers a beveridge about
The best ever perdooced sence when Nectar went out.
What wuz't a called Nectar is moor nor I knows;
But some sart o' strong Beer I be led to suppose:
Good old English homebrewed 'tis most razon to think.
O the days that be gone and 0 likewise the drink'
Where now's the stone jug as once foamed wi' mild ale *
'Tis a Beer that's been banished by Bitter and Pale.
Not a word in these days 'bout the Nutbrown of yore
And nobody never names “Stingo” no more.
Him as turns up his nose at prime Allsopp or Bass,
Iwun't noways #. but what that man's an ass.
But the best of all beers that there be under bung,
They ben’t half like them there I remembers when young.
No wonder when now, wi' folks' new-fangled ways,
'Stead o'barley they brews out o' wutts, rice, and maize,
And sugar, and serrup, and stuff sitch as that,
hereas, farmerly, e used to sparkle, ’tis flat.
From tavurn to tavurn in vaain we med roam.
'Twur the best plan to brew for our own selves at whom,
And drink health to BILL GLADSTONE, for malt duty-free,
In what I calls Nectar—the Nectar for me.
Not none of your Clarrut, whereof, true to say,
ou no forrader gits when you drinks it all day.
But sitch Beer in my boyhood as used to pervail,
Long afoor either Bitter was thought of, or Pale.
HOW IT WAS SETTLED (?)
(From a History of Europe to be Published in 1980.)
THE statesmen were assembled for the last time. There were six of
them. The Frenchman pined for his dominoes. The German thirsted
for the Bayarian beer, which he assured everyone was not to be ob-
tained in Constantinople. The Russian missed his gentle gambling.
The Italian and Austrian were both asleep. The É.i. alone
seemed to be interested in the subject under consideration, but even
he murmured something that sounded like “Want to go back to
London to attend to business.”
“What shall we do?” at length asked the Briton, after a very
long pause.
A universal yawn was the only answer.
. At last the Frenchman, who had been exhibiting signs of impa-
tience, took the initiative.
“Colleagues, my dear colleagues,” he cried, “we are terribl
bored ' ...We have submitted to heart-breaking delay—to every §
of ennui ' Why? Because we have agreed to nothing!”
There was a languid expression of assent.
“Then why should this continue " " he asked once more. “Why
should we suffer so much when, by pursuing another course, we
should escape everything P. Colleagues, we have agreed to nothing
and failed ! If we try another plan, we shall be in no worse positionſ:
Let as agree, then, to everything, and have done with it !”
In ha f-an-hour every dºcument in the room had been signed,
sealed, and delivered, and the Turks had been cordially advised by
everybody to do whatever they liked best !
So the day ended. No, not quite. Just before 4 P.M. a cloaked
figure stealthily entered the Constantinople Post-Office. It was a
disguised Ambassador hurriedly telegraphing his latest instructions—

JOHN SMAULKER JUNIOR STARTS A SOCIETY.
MY DEAR MARy,
. I said in my last that I would tell you all about the formashun of our
new Socierty for bringing Beauty ome to the Pantry. ..] now perceed to do so.
We met, a round duzzen hof us, in the Suvvinks All at Peacocke Pleasaunce.

º the perceedings with the following perryration.
Frends, and feller Suvvinks! (Murmurs.). Percisely . Them murmurs

indeed hindiwidgious. (‘Ear / ear!') Suvvice is simply Slavery—(“Quet

the most meaſyul horfis bekums a Kult, and that is the true raisin date of
Kultchaw in the Kitching. (Garsps of approval from Cook, who is a martyr to
tightlacing in the oly kors of the Konsummit.) It is igh time that, those who
live below-stairs should learn to Exist Beautifully, which can honly be done
by lea i. life wich is innardly hintense and hexternully, dekkerative. At
Presink that is honly posserble to a limited hextent. ii. all round is
* What they should be. A trooly dekkerative footman is a rare objeck, and
e distrybution of buttings on a page boy's jacket is a evvy hafliction to the
heasthetick heye. ('Ear ! ... ear” from pore young MIGGLEs, who shotted
# ºpersition to wrop hisself from view in a sage-green curting.) Neither
# the fizzikal surroundings of the suvvinks' quarters kondoocive to the free
evelopment of the Hutter, (Groans.) I know some sensitive soles—(and
ere I was a thinkin of #. MARY, dear)—whose lives is made a burding to them
along of the Philistian hobtuseness of their hemployers. Secret love of the Lily,

*Yeºp a huneasthetick carpet, dust Philistian furniture, or lay hout a dinner
wiolating all the most sacred cannons of Igh Art, is triles to wich no suvvink

in which there will then be no abasement wot somever.
(, Earſ ear !’ all round, and ‘Isn't he too tooly too f"
from MELINDER JANE.) I kommend it artily to your
pattrennage and support.”
This speech were received with applause at once
numerous and emphatick, and I were elected, mem.
kon., perpetual presidenk and poick-loreate in hordinar
to the New Socierty—the latter in konsekens of my we
known love of the Mews. One pussing presenk, hindeed,
a six foot footman, with the most wulgarly wigorous
wiskers, and carves of puffeckly rewolting protubby rance,
said that the Hintense, so fur as he *. it,
seemed a bit bilious, not to say eppyleptic, and that
limp spines, spindle shanks, and bamboo fingers were
not his hidea of flunkey “form.” . He likeways re-
marked that the “fads” of Swell Society didn't suit
the Suvvinks' All, any more than the labourer's Cottage,
and that if Beauty hinterdooced erself to his Ome, look-
ing as lanky and oller eyed as Miss HoRIANNER Low DER,
he should feel it a Christian duty to wrop her up warm
and take her straight to the Brompton Ospittle. These
Philistian sentiments was met with a gashly groan all
round, and MELINDER JANE, who wos got up in a
spideresk kostume, like a Nockturn in drab and dust
colour, struck a dekkerative hattitood of sech Medoosa
like wo, that Wiskers seemed stone-struck, and backing
out backwards, well nigh broke his back down the airey
steps.
†i, hobnoxhus hobstructive bein thus cumfably dis-
posed of, we perceeded in our oly work as reposefully
as a kumpunny of Mister BURN Jon Es's hangels. As
hº I were requested to write a sort of Inoggerel

Though the herd may contemn, 'tis a true High-Art

These, these the contours that Art yearns to create,
A leg that is spindly, a back that is straight.
Oh, where is the taste that is worthy the name
Loves not the stiff lines of this cast-iron frame?
I know not, I ask not if ease they impart,
I but know they are true to the canons of Art.
Do they call it all corners? They know not the bliss

In furnishing, firmly High Art I’ll pursue,
And I'll crouch on my gridiron couch till all's blue,

[APRIL 16, 1881.
FUSSY ACTIVITY.
PARLIAMENT, panic-stricken by
the “disaster at Nice,” has called
for returns of the exits from the
London Theatres. Parliament
would be more usefully employed
if it looked into its own Acts and
repealed those which have limited
these exits as much as ible.
That splendid example of Molly-
coddling legislation—the half-
ast twelve o'clock, Act, should
H. the first sacrificed. Under its
rovisions more than one London
§. have had to sacrifice
splendid exits and stone stair-
cases, because, forsooth, they have
communicated with restaurants,
and restaurants are forbidden to
communicate with buildings work-
ing, under a different, licence.
Such Siamese-twins as the Gaiety
Theatre and the Gaiety Restaur-
ant are joined together no more,
thanks io the fussy activity of
Parliament and the sympathetic
action of the Meddlevex Irre-
sponsibles.

Why He is Such a Dull Boy.
“’ARRY,” said, an eminent
comic singer to his friend, con-
fidentially at the Qxford, “I’m
exclusively engaged at the Music
y ; mayn't perform in a
theatre.”
“Then,” replied'ARRY, know-
ingly, “it’s 'all work and no play
with you.” -
The conclusion was so evident
that, had it not been for a good
deal of soothing syrup at 'Abby's
expense, there might have been a
serious breach of the peace.

All of the modern time.”

If the Corporation can explain
their transactions with regard to
Epping Forest, let them do so.
f they have made large pur-
chases of land and public-houses
in the heart of the Forest, let
them say so.
If their anxiety for an exten-
sion of railways into the Forest
is solely for their own benefit, let
them say so.
If their regard for the conve-
nience of the poor is only a pre-
text, let them say so.
If the scheme for invading the
Forest is really given up, let it
remain so.

The Seldom-at-Home
Secretary.
WHEN asked a question the
%|other night as to the idiotic and
offensive action of the Meddlevex
Magistrates, Sir WILLIAM HAR-
coºr said he had no authority
over these gentlemen. No one
supposed he had, but everyone
expected him to say that he
would immediately obtain au-
thority. Sir WILLIAM is not gene-
rally very polite to persons of
weak intellect, and if a so-called
Home Secretary has no power to
govern at Home, the country
might possibly like to do without
his services.
To FRIENDs. At A DISTANCE:-
We have no more room in our
waste-paper basket for any joke

THE ROUGH’S RAILWAY-GUIDE.
Rººſº THE Ready Rough may always
ºkºyº re a Third-Class Carriage, or
indeed, any carriage he can make
his way into with or without a
ticket, on the Underground Rail-
way as a sort of travelling Alsatia,
where brutal blackguardism finds
“sanctuary.”
The one duty of a Guard—as of
a watch—is to “keep time.” . He
- is not expected to keep anything
else, except tips. For instance he is not bound to keep his temper,
or to keep on the look out for Roughs.
No one has a legal right to get into a carriage which is full, but
then a third-class “...º. is full so long as one more brawny
brute can violently force his way into it.
When bent upon enjoying the exceptional }. and immuni-
ties reserved for blackguardism by the Underground Gallios, it is
only necessary for a few hulking ruffians, big of course, and half
by preference, to thrust themselves violently into some com-
artment containing not less than twice its legal complement. In
oing this they will, of course, rudely trample the toes of weak
women, and intolently dislodge the hats of inoffensive men; thus
paving the way pleasantly for future operations.
Having squeezed themselves in somehow, they can then further
indulge in the lesser amenities of travel by puffing rank tobacco
smoke in the faces of their fellow-passengers, expectorating at large
with not too nice a reference to direction, and indulging in howling,
chaff, and horse-play of the most offensive character.
The addition of blasphemy, especially if there should be women
and children present, may probably provoke a mild remonstrance
from some one, and then the Rough's opportunity has arrived
at last.
To Fºl. the Rough's rules for dealing with such an objector
and his sympathisers—if any—would be as tedious, as super-
fluous; but the combined arts of the low *.*.*. intoxi-
cated wife-beater, and the Lancashire “purler,” may be called into
§: with much enjoyment and perfect safety, until the object of
is wrath is beaten into unconsciousness or kicked into convulsions.
Qn reaching a Station, the frightened passengers may, perhaps
dare to appeal to the Guard! That autocratic official will of
course, with much an hustling and holloaing, declare that he
can't stop to interfere, his bº. not to stay actual violence
or prevent possible homicide, but to “keep time,” and the ruffianl
scoundrels go off shouting and singing “Rule Britannia,” an
telling their Jº “what a bloomin' k they’ve had in the
Hunderground.”
SIX TO ONE.
“The Identical Notes are being telegraphically agreed upon, and will be
wired to Athens to-morrow. They will be presented separately.”—Berlin
Correspondence.
SAYs St. Petersburg, “ sorry I can't interferº,
But just now l’m remarkably busy up here.'
“Which is really so true,” with a laugh, adds Berlin,
“That I strongly advise you to draw your horns in.
“Most excellent counselſ Though I’d help you,” says Rome,
“If I hadn't some business on hand nearer home.” -
“Like myself! Yº, I fear that your move made too soon is; ”
Throws in Paris. “I’ve business as near home—as Tunis.”
“Well, I know humble pie's not unlike salts and senna,
For I’ve eaten it once. 'Twasn’t nice l’” says Wienna.
“No doubt. But ‘what’s done,' don't you know, “can be undone.'
As SHAKSPEARE remarks. So, knock under,” says London.

Has the Duke of ARGYLL been forced to resign the

under Buckingham Palace, disguised in a trick wig, and

Is it true that instructions were recently despatched

ing him to refuse to take off his hat when conducting
negotiations with the SULTAN, unless the latter first
removed his fez, and said in good English, “How do you do
this morning, Sir? Thank you, Sir; I'm very well, Sir”?
Is there any authority for the rumour that HERB MOST
has been promised a Peerage on the conclusion of his
impending trial, and will probably take his seat in the
Upper House as Baron WINDMILL STREET * ..
And, finally, whether there is any foundation for the
report that the SPEAKER has expressed his intention of

Prologue.
M }. had been wash’d—well wash’d—in a Show'r ;
ut little I griev'd about that:
What I felt was the Havock a single Half-hour
Had made with my costly new Hat.
For the Boot, tho' its Lustre be dimm'd, will assume
Fresh sprightliness after a while;
But what Art may restore the original Bloom,
When once it hath flown, to the Tile *
I clomb to my Perch, and the Horses (a bay
And a brown) trotted off with a Clatter:
The Driver look'd round in his affable Way,
And said huskily, “Who is your Hatter?”
I was pleas'd that he'd notic'd its Shape and its Shine;
And as soon as we reach'd the “Old Druid,”
I begg'd that he'd drink to my new Four-and-Nine
In a Glass of his favourite Fluid.
A gratified Smile sat, I own, on my Lips
When the Barmaid tº: to the Master
(He was standing hard by with his Hands on his Hips)
To “look at the Gentleman's Castor!”

('Twas an Air that I happen'd to know
By a great foreign Maestro)—expressly to stare
At “ze Gent wizzejoli Chapeau.”
Yet how swift is the Transit from Laughter to Tears!

But 'twas ruin'd, alack, in a Day !

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
I HAD three or four days down at the House of Commons lately, and
a fine time Brown and me had of it. - - - - -
Talk of late hours, ah, them was sumthink like! . One time we
didn't have no hours at all, so to speak, but went right on sitting all
day, and sitting all night, and sitting all the morning and all the
next day ! and, as BRowN said, didn't hatch much after all. M
grayshus wot a time it was. Everybody went in for Grilled Bones
and Shampayne till we was almost grilled ourselves and had cleand
out all the shops in the nayberood, and the cry was still they come.
One of my perfeshunal friends there told me as how he found a
wunderful differrence in the Irish orders this season, none of your
gos of Whiskey as before, but reel Sham and plenty of it, and their
fust Toast, in a kind of larfing wisper, is alway, Success to the Land
Leeg, root and branches and may it flourish for ever ! just like one
of our own City Gills.
Oh didn't sum on 'em look retchedly sleepy and washed out about
8 or 9 o'clock in the morning ! A good turn at the Pump wood ha’
done some on 'em , praps, as BRowN said, in more ways than
one, but of course I don't know what he meant, some imperance I
spose as usual.
I smiles to myself as I goes into the House sumtimes and sees a
whole row of poor devils a waiting for hours with their orders for a
seat in the Strangers' Galery (we calls it the crown Gallery, for you
can allers get in for a crown, for particulars enquire of Pleaceman
X.), and all jest for the chance of seeing sum of the emanent Swells
at a distance, whereas I has the honer not only of seeing 'em close,
but of listening to 'em, aye and talking to 'em quite familyer" Say-
ing to Mr. GLADstuN, for instance, “Shall I get you a little more
Tung, Sir?” or to Sir Wilſº ARcount, “Kyan Pepper, Sir?” or
to Mr. BIGGER, “A little Bore's Head, Sir?” or to Mr. DILLoN,
“A little Lamb, Sir?” or to Mr. ForsTER, “A little more Irish Stew,
Sir?” ansettrer, ansettrer, aye and P. for it too into the Bargane.
Take 'em as a hole the House of Commons, aint harf such good
judges of a Dinner as my reglar patrons in the City. They don't
understand the natteral order of things, and allers eats in an urry,
which is itself enuff to spile any dinner.
They allers seems a lissening for a Bell, like a young Waiter as
hasn't learnt to take things coolly, and, when it rings, away they
rushes like so many Manyacs leaving their dinner harf eaten. Why
they can't leave off sitting and rise for a nour or 2 and have their
dinner cumfortable, is what I can't understand. I’m sure it wood
be better for their helth and better for their temper, for the langwidge
Y|as sum on 'em uses on these occashuns is reelly quite staggering.
I'm making sum private memoryandums of every celebrated man's
favorite Dish, and of what he eats on certain grate occashuns, and if
ever I am injuiced to print ’em, that will be one of the most interest-
ing publiccashuns ever red.
Sum of the items will be found to be strangely epropriet to certain
Public Men.
While the World is a wundering and Truth is a speckylating, why,
on such and such a day, some of the werry grandest of 'em came out
so grandly, and why on another occasion they mad such a Hash of it,
my book will explane the whole mystery. It all depends on what
they had for Dinner |
What's the use of telling a man of my grate experiense that a cut
of Mutton and a pint of Bass can produce the same noble sentemens
the same staggering langwidge as a couple of slices of Wensun from a
noble Hornsh and a pint of Sham, followed by a Bird and a Salad
and a Pint of Burgundy.
Why the thing's Ridickerlus!
I quite agrees with BRow N, tho'I don't quite know what he means,
when he says, “If the Mind's the ‘Standard' of the man, the Stum-
muck's the "Telegraphſ of the Mind.”
(Signed) Robert.

THE BALACLAVA CHARGE-ONE SHILLING-
PANORAMA.
TURNSTILEs to right of them, Turnstiles to left of
*.Go the Six Hundred Thousand!—at a shilling
a head.
The entrance to the Panorama is suggestive of
something between a heathen temple (with turn-
stiles), a theatre, a music-hall, a church (with
turnstiles, of course), and a mausoleum. You are
not allowed to go straight before you, but have at
once to turn to the left and descend. Be careful of
the steps. Why go down to a Panorama P. This is
the first mystery.
After the first twenty steps there is a refreshment-
- stall, apparently let into the wall. Here a military
person, in uniform, with medals, was regaling himself; but unless
positively fatigued by your exertion so far, you had better delay
refreshment until your return, when you may need it. The military
veteran is, I fancy, retained for past services on the establishment,
and may be inclined to afford information of considerable interest to
a very civil civilian. At the bottom of the steps there are two
passages open before you, one to “the right of them ’’ and one
to “the left of them.” Which to choose? is the question. I suspect
that the veteran whom I passed on the landing above ought to be
here prepared to receive visitors. In the absence of this distinguished
sentinel from his post, take the left and you’ll choose right.
Along tortuous melancholy passages, until, if you º to be
alone, you are about to give up finding the Panorama at all, and are
beginning to feel like a Babe in the Wood without the other babe,
when you come upon a heavy oriental curtain, which you lift ner-
vously under the impression that you have lost your way, an
wandered somehow out of the Panorama into a Turkish Bath. You
are not quite sure also that you won't turn up in a Linendraper's
establishment next door, and suddenly appear from a trap-door
under the cashier's desk, or shoot up behind a counter in the back
shop. However it is all right. You lift the curtain; you pass
beyond the mystic veil; you ascend—thank heaven, at }. you
ascend –and far off—up above you a voice is heard, shrilly and
clearly, “Book of the Panorama, Six-pence / Panorama and Guide,
Six-pence.” Then another voice adds, “This way down; this way
down”—and blessing your stars that there is at least one sweet
little cherub who sits up aloft to keep watch for the visitor, you
cheer up and reach the top—only to see nothing at all, except a lot
of people, crushing each other against some obstacle, and looking
at something which you hope is the Charge of Balaclava.
The first point is where to begin. Go straight before you, elbow
every one out. Here you will be wedged in by several other people
with elbows as energetic and powerful as your own, and here you
will have to remain until you fight your way to another position.
Take care your hat is not knocked off into the sham battle-field.
To find out who is who in the picture is difficult. A French
General taking off his cocked hat and saluting the audience as
though he had just finished a “scene in a Circus on a trained steed,”
attracts the attention at once as a figure both natural and graceful.
Lord CARDIGAN can be recognised without trouble; his Lordship is in
a very flourishing condition, and apparently calling out to the Artist,
“Here! hiſ look at me ! I'm the fellow for you to take l’” The
Artist took him, which is more than the enemy could do. Sir
GEORGE Woyſ Bw ELL is down in the plan of the picture, but I
couldn't find him anywhere. Happening to inquire of some one where
the popular “Sir JARGE.” was in the Panorama, I was informed that
he had just left. No wonder I couldn’t find him. The information
given me was, I subsequently ascertained, strictly correct, as at that
precise moment the missing warrior was talking to a friend in Regent
Street, and I cannot blame him for not being in two places at once.
Unfortunately I dropped my Guide-Book into the field of battle
where it disappeared for a second among the property cannons and
waggons; only to reappear in the stuffed hand of a dummy Russian
1Il remarkably thin-soled boots, where, unless it has been since swept
up by the charwomen on duty, it may be taken for a military
*...* or a code of secret signals just tumbled out of the soldier's
pocket. Owing to this loss I have somehow got into my head that
the Artist's name is Spoilpot—or something i. it.
The general idea suggested by Messrs. Sport.pot & Co. seems to be,
“‘O let me like a soldier fall,” only be sure there's an Artist there
to see me.” The military actors in the scene seem to have done ||
deeds of theatrical daring with one eye on the enemy and the other
on the Artist. . But for all this—'tis a clever, picture, and—there’s
money in it. In consequence of this success there will, of course, be
a surfeit of Panoramas; and already there is one advertised for
Oxford Street, and another for the Crystal Palace. Shall we go
back to Dioramas and Cosmoramas? O the happy days when we
were young ! |

THE REAL CITY CENSUS.
THE Corporation seems waking up.
Not content with the great experiment
they are trying with so much success
with the Electric Light, they have deter-
mined to set an example to the Govern-
ment, and show them what a Census
º to be.
hey seem to say, Who cares where a
man sleeps? we want to catch him when
he's wide awake, and not only up, but
up to everything, from Peruvians to
Consols, from Tea to Tallow. So every
good Citizen will be asked, on Monday
“Fussiness, Drs-CENsus,” the 25th, a few questions of quite a
different character to those just answered
by the rest of Her Majesty's subjects. -
These said questions have been under the consideration of the City
Officials for months past. The Engineer drew them up, the Comp-
troller controlled the operation, the Acting Remembrancer acted his
art to perfection, and saw that nothing was forgotten. The Town
lerk made so many Minutes of their proceedings that they occupied
several hours... The Chamberlain in full Court Suit introduced them
to the City Soheitor, who solicited a copy for his especial perusal,
“º same, 13s. 4d.”
e have been unable to obtain a Proof of the proposed Census
Paper, ours being under proof and under censure, so we sent a mes-
senger to the Foreign Office to ascertain how these things are managed,
but his reception was so uncommonly warm that he left hurriedly.
However, having a slight acquaintance with a certain Compositor, in
a certain office, ºi RogFRs, we administered such a composing
draught to him, that he furnished us in return with a draught of his
own composition from RogFRs' Pleasures of Memory.
A few extracts from this may be acceptable:–
Questions to be answered in full.
Who are you?
What are you ?
Where are you when you are at home f
What is your Wife's name?
What was your Wife's name? -
What will your Wife's name probably be some day?
What was }. age 10 years ago?
What is it now f
Have you a Mother-in-Law P. If not, why not?
What age is your Elder Brother, and how long has he been your
Elder Brother ? Is he anybody else's Elder Brother ? Does he
belong to the Elder Brethren of Trinity House? If so, why?
How many people do you employ, and do you call them all Em-
ployés, or only those who can speak French P
%. is the average age of the oldest among them?
Do they sleep on the Premises after dinner
State with great particularity the largest number of Persons that
ever passed your door on one day, taking as an average, say, Lord
Mayor's Day ? -
State their average ages and occupations?
What annual amount of Profit do you make f
What amount do you return to the Income Tax P
Are you on friendly terms with the Assessor *
How many Horses does your Father keep?
What colour are they?
Does he bruise his Oats? How many Beans make five * - - -
How many Horses pass your door from sun-rise to sunset, distin-
guishing those in single harness from those in double harness?
Explain why those in double harness require more harness than
other Horses. -
When you are out, does your Mother-in-Law know you're out?
How many Persons have entered your Premises during the last
twenty-four hours ?
(N.B.-This is the important question.
By counting every visit as a separate Visitor, and carefully mani-
pulating say, the two men and a boy of your establishment by send-
ing them out all day on short errands for very trifling matters, you
can swell up the number of Visitors to something almost too awful
Moderate energy would raise your number to at least 500. -
As there are about 10,000 houses in the City, if all the inhabitants
follow your example, the people in the City on the eventful 25th will
e proved to amount to about Five Millions, which is exactly what
the Day Census is intended to prove.)

THE BRIGHTER DAYS OF BANKRUPTCY–
A CONTRAST.
YESTERDAY.
WHY do all the assembled Creditors look so miserable?
Ha! that must be the Debtor's Solicitor dancing a
fandango by himself in his private room."
How quaint that that suspicious-looking man without
a shirt-collar should have been appointed Trustee!
Though the debts in this liquidation are proved to the
amount of £5374 9s. 6d., as the assets are set down at
£122 10s., everybody, one feels, will get a little.
Did I understand you that the Trustee, the Solicitor,
and the insolvent Debtor are finishing the evening to-
gether at the Criterion?
How strange that, though three years have passed,
nobody has yet got .#
It grieves me to hear the Trustee say he “will punch
my head well” if I don't mind my own business.
Considering all things, the insolvent Debtor is now
really looking remarkably well.
To-MoRRow.
I am not surprised that the beautiful statement of the
Bankrupt has moved the Court to tears.
Give the highly-respectable Solicitor, who has managed
the whole business, his well-earned Six-and-eightpence,
and let him go.
If the Taxing-Master has all this news broken
to him at once, he will certainly go off his head.
Look! Somebody has paid One-and-fourpence into the
Bank of England!
I thought the sudden announcement that there might

ysterics!
This straightforward, honourable, manly insolvency is
positively refreshing.

proud, upright Bankrupt without a shadow of a stain
upon his character.
Ha! I thought so. The Judge himself has just an-
nounced his intention of “going through his own Court
like a man.”
A NEW ATTACHMENT.
IN consequence of the many mistakes discovered in
the procedure in the Lord Mayor's Court (to wit “Foreign
Attachment,” &c.), this wonderful º ace of justice”
will be known in future as the Lord Mare's Nest.
IBILLINGSGATE MARKET AGAIN |
PROBABLY most of Mr. Punch's many
readers thought that the statement quoted
by him the other day, from the proceed-
ings of the Court of Common Council, with
regard to telegrams being sent by Billings-
gate Salesmen to their consigners to the
following effect, “Send no more fish at any
price,” “Market glutted,” &c., was of a
rather staggering description, considering
how scarce and ă. fish is and has been,
but what will be thought of this:–
“A system which allows the vans, whose con-
tents ought to be on sale, to describe continous
and interminable circuits in crowded thorough-
fares under a summer sun, is especially unfavourable to the buyer, but not so
unfavourable to the salesman. It avoids, to a certain extent, a glut; and a
glut is the salesman's difficulty, but the buyer's opportunity.
“The vans which arrive first at . may contain fish for which
there is no particular demand ; instead, therefore, of being unpacked, they
are forced to move on and thread their way through the crowded thorough-
fares of London, till they are able to obtain a fresh place in the line. §.
van, whose case was exceptionally unfortunate, returned in this way, not
merely time after time, but day after day for eleven days! The fish which it
contained was, of course, ultimately condemned.”
Mr. Punch is quite prepared to believe that these statements will
be received º all who read them as something not only incredible,
but utterly absurd in their extravagance, and yet they are literally
“Sol E OH ! ”
true, and are quoted in the Citizen, as forming part of an official
Report on Billingsgate Market, just sent by Mr. SPENCER WALPOLE,
the fish inspector, to the Home Secretary' -
No wonder poor Londoners are longing in vain for cheaper and
fresher fish, and the almost incredible statement just quoted is
another proof of what shameful waste and shameful neglect are
allowed to exist where the interests of the many are sacrificed to
those of the few.
Of course, it is the poor who suffer, as usual. The poor plaice and
the humble herring must make way for the princely salmon and the
lordly turbot, and go on their weary round getting staler and staler
and flabbier and flabbier, till even the Billingsgate inspector con-
demns them as too bad even for the poor.
A Rhyme with a Reason.
YoUR skill as a painter of portraits bids fair
To become the town talk. (Please pronounce it as talc, O Holl!)
Your health ! May your pictures be found everywhere—
Ubiquitous, -just as Herr MüNTz declares alcohol.

TO THE NORTHERN TERROR.—AN APPEAL.
WHEN hate is hushed, and hot-tongued clamour dies,
Wisdom speaks forth. Not hers the vengeful shout
obs or Monarchs, whose conflicting cries
Clash like cold blades in some barbario rout
With the bloodthirst upon them. Ringed about
By clouds of strife, she fixes steadfast eyes
th's unshifting pole-star. Dread and doubt,
Power's fierce wrath, Revolt's loud revelries, -
Shake not calm Thought, which high above the tumult flies.
0. the heart will ache. So long, so sore
The blind contention; hate that still breeds hate;
Bloodshed that never better fruitage bore
Than profitless reprisal. He who late
Shook the serfs' fetters loose, and did the State
A more than princely service, shattered falls,
A prey to sleuth-hound malice—harshest fate
hat e'er struck kindly heart—while frenzy calls
In menace to the heir in his Imperial halls.
Dark menace, and with purpose yague of form
E'en to its frantic framers; like the rage
Of sightless Polyphemus. Hearts will warm
To patriots who open warfare wage
Boldly against the tyrant of their age;
But mole-like Murder mining, blind as sly,
Its ruthless way, with indiscriminate gage
Hurled against good and evil, low or high,
Is treason to the cause of ordered Liberty.
She must disown the lurking fiends who’d blast
A blameless legion in her sacred name,
And from her roll of honour coldly cast.
The assassin—branded with the assassin's shame.
When he, the gentlest of his line, whose fame
Was the chiser's, so § fell, , .
All generous hearts flung back the ying claim
To hail his murderers heroes, knowing well
The hate that prompts such deeds is set on fire of hell.
And now the vague vast Terror takes a voice
Of human sort, nor all inhuman tone,
Proffering Power a Fº choice.
Out from the dark it comes, of source unknown
As that which moaned Pan's requiem through the lone
Arcadian woods; yet better thus than .
Mine on in murderous muteness 'neath the throne,
A .. death, a cold and cruel will
Sworn b y to subvert and bloodily to kill.
Put manhood in your wrath, nor foul the work
Ye call divine with demon ruthlessness.
No º poison-fanged and snake-like lurk
On the hard path which Power awhile must press,
Although of will the thralls to free and bless
Whose galling chains were forged in earlier time.
Not ermined Power alone ji. the stress
Of the world's strife, nor take the stain and slime
Of all its age-old wrong, and many-centuried crime.
Kings have their heritage of shackling ill
As well as Peoples. ... He enthroned to-day
Lifts with the crown the chain; patriot good-will
Would grante'en Kings the vantage of fair-play,
Hate is a hound o'er prompt to track and slay,
But 'tis the work of dogs, not men, to rage
Red-fanged yet still insatiate for prey.
Let human ruth inhuman wrath assuage,
And leave in History's roll one unensanguined page.
“Spoons!”
THE not very numerous, and rather useless class, who are born
with silver ". ns in their mouths, are not the most enthusiastic
admirers of Mr. GLADStone's Budget. They object to suck away
threepence an ounce every year for six years, until at last their
spoons have lost nearly ten per cent, in value. . Possessors of the
family tea-pot are also dissatisfied, and Maiden Aunts are unable to
see why their little property in plate should be slowly and surely
depreciated.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MICHAEL STROGOFF;
OR, NoNE ARE so BLIND As Those who Wow'r SEE.
Michael STRogoFF is the very piece for the Adelphi. The º
version of Messrs. D'ENNERY and JULEs VERNE’s drama has been
thoroughly well done by Mr. H. J. BYRON,
who has put into his own part plenty of what
the old Greek Actors—or the old Grecian
actors-were wont to term, professionally,
** @ar.
Prologue.—Mr. FERNANDEz, disguised as
an old something (Plate 1), accompanied—he
doesn't sing, but still he is accompanied by
Sangarre, #. BERNARD-BEERE, who looks
decidedly handsome as a sort of niece of
Azucena the Gipsy in Il Troratore, with lots
of jingling coins and very fashionable high-
heeled boots, obtains a “pass for two” from
a very gentlemanly official, of whom they
speak between themselves somewhat fami-
liarly as “the Guv'nor.”
These two, Ican Ogareff and Sangarre
travel together throughout the piece, and as
he is, always appearing in some new, dress,
and she is perpetually in this fancy Zingara
costume with the high-heeled boots, it seems
as if they only wanted some little encourage-
ment and a tambourine to induce them to
- give their first-class entertainment consist-
ing of national airs and dances. But whether on account of her
having left her tambourine at home, or from any lack of specu-
lative energy, or
from their not hav-
ing had “an agent
in advance,” and
having been “well
billed,” the result is
that they never do
anything at all, at
least, not in this
line, and so far are
:::::::::: disap-
jºining the public.
f we reject this
theory of their in-
tending to come out

tainers, the reason of
their travelling to-

he Guv'nor wants
to get a secret des-
patch conveyed to the Grand Duke. Whom can he trust? “Michael
Strogoff,” suggests. Mr. T. A. PALMER, representing the eminent
General Riezoff, who doesn’t reappear after this bit of advice—so
Mrs. BERNARD BEERE.
Not at all a half-and-
half sort of person.
Low soul’d, but high-
heel'd.
“WE ARE AMERRY FAMILY, we ARE!”
CHARLEs the “A WARNER!” and Miss GERARD,
who is not cheered up by Mrs. HuxxIN' WHEEzin.
AFTER THE BATTLE.
Appearance of the Sole Survivor, the Artist, Mr. Beverley, who was,
of course, on the spot.
much for Kiezoff and he’s off. Enter Michael Strogoff. Here the
dialogue is conducted on the Ollendorff plan. We forget the exact
words, but this is the idea:-
The Guv'nor. Who will take this letter?
Michael. I will take this letter.
The Guv'nor. To the Grand Duke?
Michael. To the Grand Duke.
The Guv'nor. You will see your mother?
Michael. I will see your mother. No-Iwill see my mother.
The Guv'nor (a little irritated). You will not speak to your
mother?
Michael. I will not speak to your—I mean my mother.
The Guv'nor. You swear it?
Michael. I swear it. [Salutes mechanically and erit abruptly.

Then the guests enter and the Curtain descends. The prologue
finishes with a brilliant fete given in the Guv'nor's grounds, which
bear a striking resemblance to Cremorne in its best days.
We should i. mentioned that everyone in the Prologue seems
bound for Yarkootz, or Airkootz, or Earkootzk; but of their precise
destination we are still uncertain, as there was a pleasing variety
about the pronunci-
ation. For ourselves,
werather fancy that,
on the whole, the
weight of authority,
without reference to
the Russian Brad-
shaw, was in favour
of Airkootzk.
ACT I. — Here
stands a Post House.
A very droll scene
follows between Mr.
H. J. By Ron, as
ComicCo ndent
of, we should say,
the Family Herald,
and Mr. IRISH, who
represents the equal-
3. comic French
orrespondent of - -
some Parisian paper, say the Journal pour Rire, and the fact that it
is “pour rear” will account for his always allo his brother
journalist to be getting before him with the news. 1 the scenes
between these two are very funny, and prevent, the piece, which
mainly relies upon spectacle, from ever becoming dull.
H. J. B., the Comic Co. ndent of the Family
Heraiº, and the º “woa. Emir.”
After the Burning of the Town in the Last Act they “take it hazy."
Nadia Fedor (Miss GERARn), an interesting young lady travelling
alone to visit her father, tells her touching story to Michael, who
asks her to travel with him as his sister, to which she cheerfully
consents. Why not? A charming companion. Mr. FERNANDF:
(Plate 2) enters with Azucena's niece and has a row with Michael.
More Ollendorff dialogue:–

Ivan. You will not fight me f
Michael. I will not fight you.
Ivan (who has evidently seen Bor and Coz). Then come on!
[“Comes on ” by himself, thrashes MICHAEL, and goes off with
AzucenA's niece in MICHAEL's trap. MICHAEL and NADIA
jollow how they can, and on we go again in the direction of
Airkootzk.
ACT II.-Telegraph Office near some place that is much spoken
of as “Coaly Wan.” Another funny scene between the Comic Cor-
respondents. First appearance of Mrs. WEZIN, Mrs. Strogoff
; ichael's mother), a very troublesome person, while Mrs. BERNARD-
EERE, still as Azucena's niece in high-heeled boots, whispers to
somebody, whom she can trust, “Observe everything and say no-
thing,” which seems to be her, own rule of conduct, as she stops in
corners looking unutterable things and striking attitudes, which,
remarkable in themselves as specimens of poses plastiques, lose some-
thing of their value by not being connected with any particularly
definite meaning. Mrs. Strogoff gets her son into trouble for the
first time. The place is blown up, and discovers a battle-field after
a successful engagement. This scene alone will show that Mr.
BEVERLEY's pencil can draw all London.
ACT III.-Mr. FERNANDEz in another costume (Plate 3), tries to
terrify the Comic Correspondents, who are then brought before the
Ameer, with whom Mr. BYRON is jocosely familiar—the scene being
most intensely absurd from its utter improbability; Roars of
laughter... Mrs. Strogoff gets her son into further difficulties. Of
this troublesome but well-intentioned old lady Michael Warner—
an association of names from DICKENs's Battle of Life by the way—
might say:—
Who was it met me with a shout,
Who was it nearly got the knout,
And made me get my eyes put out P
My Mother!
So his eyes are put out at the cruel Ameer's command, and Mrs.
Strogoff swoons. Here the Act should end, but it doesn't, and
A WELL-MoUNTED PIECE.
Michael, º blind, leaves his mischievous mother for dead
(no such luck), and is led off by Nadia, who now kindly undertakes
the part of the blind man's dog. -
ACT IV.-None are so blind as those who won't see, so Michael
turns out not to be blind at all, and his mother to be as lively as
ºver and ready to get him into another, difficulty, which sh9, does
forthwith. They are relieved from a perilous situation by the Comic
Cºrrespondents, who shoot all the Tartars and take them away—
still towards Airkootzk—on an inconveniently crowded raft. Ivan
£ets the river on fire, and we are shown another grand scene by Mr.
BEVERLEy, representing the town after the conflagration.
ACT W.-At the Grand Duke's. Enter Mr. FERNANDEz (Plate 4),
terrific struggle between Michael and himself: triumph of Michael
and consequent end of piece. What had become of Azucena's niece
we did not learn. Perhaps she was somewhere about, still conscien-
tiously posturing in corners on the stage, but hidden from the gaze
of the audience by the smoke which lingered fondly on the scene;
9 perhaps in the interim she had obtained a good engagement at
the º: House at St. Petersburg; but no one particularly cares,
and all ends smokily but happily. The acting, where there is any,
is good, but jº the É. Correspondents have far and away
the best of it. Altogether a decided Attraction Engine.
A Club Dialogue.
Bzcited Club Member (to a find). I say, wasn't that ToMPKINs

A CONTRACT UNDER SEAL.
First Letter, addressed to a Cabinet Maker.
DEAR W. E. G.
OF course I was very much obliged to you when you made
me a Peer. Still, the position has its disadvantages—it is difficult
to find anyone to quarrel with, and I have been obliged to give up
my bicycle. Under the circumstances, therefore, I think you owe
me reparation. In a word, pay your debt by making me Privy Seal.
I am sure I could make more of it than the Budget, and I am satis-
fied to leave VERNON HARCOURT at peace (?) in my old quarters at
the Home Office. I will promise not to play the fool this time.
Yours (always the same), (Signed) BOB.
Second Letter, addressed to a Cabinet Maker.
DEAR AND RIGHT HoN. SIR,
I HAVE not addressed you for some time, because I have felt
that, I have not been altogether fairly treated in the matter of
Military Reform. If you will be so kind as to carry your memory
back to a few years ago, you will recollect that it was I who
invented the now celebrated Army Territorial mixture. Mr. CHIL-
DERs at the time, I believe, was all at sea at the Admiralty. But
let that pass. I would merely hint that I believe I can do as much
for the re-organisation of the Privy Seal as of the Soldiers—perhaps
re-organise it away altogether l Need I say more ?
I write myself, more in sorrow than in anger,
(Signed) AN Ex-CABINET MINISTER IN THE LORDs.
Third Letter, addressed to a Cabinet Maker.
DEAR WILLIAM,
WITHOUT being º: presumption, I think I may fairly
suggest that my reign at St. Martin's-le-Grand has not been quite
unsuccessful. Now it seems to me that there is a natural transition
from handling a letter to using a Seal. I have noticed that the
“post” (as we would say at my office) of Keeper is vacant. I think
if I am appointed I may very shortly be able to supply the Public
with the article at a rate unprecedented for cheapness. I would
willingly resign the Telegraph Clerks too, to other hands. But do
not hesitate to say “no”.if you think it advisable. You know from
experience that I can wait, Sincerely yours,
(Signed)
Circular Reply to the above.
MY DEAR —,
Is it necessary to say that you are the very man for the
E.; of Keeper of the Privy Seal? I really think not! But you
ow how .#. I love a good practical joke | When I am in a
rollicking mood, I cannot refrain from doing something to make
everybody laugh! So I have offered the Privy Seal to CARLING FORD !
And the best of the fun is—he has actually accepted it!
But here comes the pith of the jest! I have told CARLINGFORD
that he must carry the Irish Land Bill through the House of Lords!
Poor CARLINGFORD, it is rather, hard upon him But you must
admit it is a splendid pleasantry'
Yours, most cordially and hilariously,

MR. ToolE and Sir FREDERICK LEIGHTON, whose well-known love
of net-fishing often leads them into exciting adventure, were, one
afternoon last week, intent on their favourite pursuit on the
parapet of the Thames Embankment, when Sir FREDERICK suddenly
tumbled head-foremost into the water. There was the usual rush to
the side, and the President, striking out lustily, and crying for help
shouted out that he should be drowned. “No, you won’t,” rejoined
his witty colleague, watching his struggles with evident humour.
“You won't be drowned. You're bound to be hung, you know.”
When this was repeated by the crowd to the Thames Police, who
came up five-and-twenty minutes later, they laughed, so im-
moderately that they .# scarcely pull the distinguished Acade-
mician out.

Saturday-Tired of bed. Such a lovely morning, that I could
not refrain from getting up to have a little wood-cutting. Dressed
myself and went into the Park. Had just taken off my coat and
waistcoat, when I was suddenly : gagged, and handcuffed.
Before I could expostulate I was hustled into a special express train
with iron blinds all down, thence into a prison van, and driven off
at a gallop to Scotland, Yard. When I got there (late at night) I
was taken at once into the Private Room of the Director of Criminal
Investigation. HowARD VINCENT profuse in his apologies. He said
that there had been some mistake. The fact was his men, seeing me
with an axe, and knowing that there were Fenian Skirmishers about,
had taken me for——Exploded !!!

That was a mean trick, you'll allow ; and while I think of it. Inip
down and blow out those lamps, which are no better than a noosance,
tho' the light does cheer a man in his solitude. By the cut of his jib
I set him down as a lawyer—an Old Bailey lawyer without a doubt,
for he nodded to JEM BILEs, the noted pickpocket, who was mouching
about at the corner of the Haymarket as my swell went in to buy a
a bacca. And then all the waiters at the Criterion grinned at him,
and I know more than one Old Bailey practitioner as has no office
except for show, and a sort of hutch for the grubby clerk, and chooses
to do all his business standing at the bar of the Criterion. Bless

maids just to keep his hand in, and practise the toothy smile which
he always used to put on when he'd just tumbled a witness, into
perjury. I've seen young gents rush in there, all pasty-faced and
anxious, of an evening while waiting for a job, and have a word

signal and crawl out agin, with him follerin' and gettin' into the
brougham with 'em to have a long palaver, he looking like a hawk,
while they cried like anything. -
I carried him reg’lar once, so I'd every advantage for watching
the game. There he used to stand over the bar, waving what he
ed his “forensic finger” (whatever that may mean), and chatting
and laughing with hat at back of head, as if there was no sich thing
as care, and all the folks crowding round, with Fº guffaws, to
hearken to his spicy jokes. And then praps one of the veiled ladies
would show in the doorway, or else his grubby clerk would shamble
in and mutter somethin whilst eyeing the drinks sideways out of
the corner of a wishful organ, and passing his dry tongue around
his leathery lips, and standing on one foot, with, the other on the
instep, just as I've seen cranes do at the ºl. And when that
grubby clerk came (looking so queerly out of º ace among the tiptop
swells and gaudy decorations and glittering glasses and bottles), the
joke—whatever it might be—would be snapped in two like the
swinging of a convict's door at Millbank—(don't poke, your fun at
me, and say as how I've no business to know about Millbank doors)
—and the hat would take a turn, and come down all of its own
accord over the domineering frown, and he'd ask that grubby clerk,
in a voice as sharp as a City waiter's knife that's ºf ham, what
was up? and his eyes would glitter like hot coals, and he'd scratch
his stübbly grey pate, with the other hand under his coat-tails; and
the admiring audience would take a swig at their drinks, and per-
litely look i. other way while my bloke considered the case over
and the clerk was nearly mad with envy of the liquor.
at a rum fish he was, to be sure, and what a life he led ! You
never could tell where to take him. One minute he'd be like ile,
the next he'd blow your head off. I fondly believe that nobody
knew him so well as I did. Certainly not his wife; as certainly not
his clerk. He had no #ie."...Y friends I mean ; tho' he was
smothered, with acquaintances, and tormented out of his life by
clients. Maybe he was so deep-versed in other people's crime that
he never knew genuine peace—was alway fermenting, as it were,
like wine, with bad stuff that wouldn't keep at the bottom. Any-
way, he got into a habit of going about hisself as if he’d murdered
some one, whose skillington was a rattling. He was a perambulating
riddle. Nobody was to know where he iv.; and he was never at
his office, and yet he had more shady cases on hand than any lawyer
breathing; and he could be so {. and familiar and light and gay
when he wasn't pulling your heartstrings out in court. Many a
time he's said to me, “John ” (my name's WILLIAM), “I shall want
to sleep in your cab to-night, so go home with this note, and fetch
me some warm things.” The note was open, and it didn’t seem to
matter who read it—me, or the Missus, or the maid. What a start
And then I'd bring back a rug and a greatcoat and a travelling cap
and muffler, and he’d bid me drive him to a secluded spot where no
one passes by of a night, and he'd call the night-Bobby, and give
him a shilling or two not to disturb his rest, and coil himself up
like a dormouse, and there was an end of him: while I trotted u
and down the livelong night, and at a given hour I’d wake him, an
he’d have a cup of coffee at a stall hard-by, and an easy shave and
wash-up for a penny, and then sit reading, ing great long
briefs and things, and hail a hansom when the time came, and rattle
off to plead, as fresh as paint and as smug as a parson 1
Whatever did he do it for P I used to wonder. Was he afraid to
o home? Why?. If he could show himself in Court, why should
e not sleep cosily in bed as free-hearted Christians do? Was it one
of the peculiar crooked fads which we’re all subject to, and which
show we’ve a bee in our bonnet somewhere f or had he a cause for
slinking so * I believe Nature meant him for an eel, Be that as it
may, I never cleared it up; and now he's dead and gone, and has
left it all a queer London mystery,
But I must beg pardon, Sir, and say good-bye for the present.

BANKRUPTCY FOR THE
MILLION.
THERE was a time when therich
had a monopoly of all the luxuries,
and the poor had to be content
with the leavings of the rich;
Many years of free-trade, liberal
government, and *ś news-
papers have changed the order of
things, and now the most vene-
jºi... are brought within
the reach of the multitude. Early
strawberries, plovers' eggs, as-
paragus, ortolans, and green peas
are as plentiful as blackberries—
more plentiful, we are glad to say,
as wenever relished blackberries;
and even bankruptcy, which was
once the exclusive luxury of the
aristocratic trader, is now to be
as common as excursion trains or
fourteen shilling trousers. Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN has brought in a
Bill which proposes to give a
creditor for the paltry sum of £20
the power to issue a fiat, and
which also proposes to abolish the
ecial protection accorded to
embers of Parliament. A debtor
who cannot or will not pay his
tailor's bill is now to be treated
with as much consideration as a
“merchant prince,” and unpaid
milk-scores are to rub shoulders
with the greatest financial swin-
dles. The blue-blood of insol-
vency º to rise against such
insolent dicalism, before the
Church, the House of Lords, the
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN, and the
Meddlevex Magistrates are swal-
lowed up in the general vortex.

WHAT DOES IT MEAN ?
DURING the Recess weinstinctively turn to the adver-
tisements in our daily papers for healthy recreation and
amusement. And among the theatrical amusements
alone do we find that pure English, that frank candour,
that ingenuous modesty which are so dear to us all.
But among the advertisements now appearing there is
one which we confess puzzles us. Here it is:—
T. JAMES’S THEATRE. –Notice.—In deference to a
enerally expressed wish that some performances of THE
LADY OF LYONS should be given at this theatre, the Manage-
ment begs to announce that this favourite play will be pro-
duced on EASTER MONDAY NEXT, and repeated on eac º night
with Mr. A. W. PINERo's successful comedy of THE MONEY-SPINNER.
What is," a generally expressed wish?”. In the country when we
see that “by desire of the garrison The Clergyman's Daughter will
be performed,”, we understand that some mature syren has succeeded
in making a §º officer a greater idiot than even nature intended
him to be, hen, we see “by desire” in London, we know that the
Author has got hold of the Manager, and over a cigar has suggested
“Why don't you put up that piece of mine for a bit, old man? ;:
But the above advertisement fairly floors us. How is a wish gene-
rally expressed ? Does an occupant of the Gallery arise, and having
caught the Manager's eye wit *W. missile handy, proceed, “Hiſ
you there ! Just chuck that up ! e are sick to ãº of it. You
§ the Lady of Lyons, or I'm blowed if I come here again.”
Or does the proud owner of a box throw a bouquet on to the stage,
in which is artfully concealed a note, “No more flowers for you
unless you play the Lady of Lyons.” Does the fit rise as one man,
and “generally express a wish " ? Or do the Stallites wait at the
stage-door, and having taken forcible possession of the Manager,
threaten there and then to take his life unless he immediately pro-
duces the Lady of Lyons? Again we ask, How is it done?
THAT ACROSTIC.
WE hate Acrostics, and would send Across Styx the inventor of
these fearfully absorbing puzzles, but having undertaken to supply
the answer to the Acrostic in last week's number, we hasten to
inform the two thousand and one excited Correspondents that they are
anything but “all right up to now,” and that the real solution is—

thing about the matter, and as, in these Nihilist days, we may pos-
sibly be the victim of some dreadful plot, we beg to state that the
correctness of the solution is not guaranteed; but we only hope and
trust it is all right. If it isn't—“Revenge, TIMoTHEU's cries"—

THE CONFERENCE ON COIN.
THE Monetary Conference is sitting, but as far as one can see, it
doesn't seem likely to hatch º: particularly golden in the
shape of a financial panacea. The three or four waggon-loads of
pamphlets on the Currency take a good deal of time to sleep over, and
the specialists with a scheme for extinguishing national debts, have a
trick of extinguishing their audience to begin with. But one or two
decisions have been definitely arrived at ; and the Universe can pay
its income-tax in full confidence that it will be muddled away
according to the most ingenious systems. - -
The objection to bi-metalism evinced by countries which only
possessed bronze and copper was soon overruled ; and the suggestion
of the San Fandango Anarchy that promissory notes would form a
nice handy medium of circulation, met with a somewhat undiplomatic
reception, which led to an interchange of coinage specimensin oroide,
Dutch metal, and zinc, which was not internationally courteous.
Post-obits payable on assassination of South American Presidents are
not to obtain currency on this side of the Atlantic. - -
The Turkish motion on the subject of compulsory lending is only
expected to be brought forward the next week, and the spirit of the
Conference is so commercially coarse that three nations will meet
it with a direct and even indignant negative. . - -
Francs and sous seem to be first favourites with the great majority
of the Conference; but we have not noticed as yet any insurmount-
able objection to British sovereigns—even on the part of French
Republicans.
“Words ! Words! Words !”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
POSTERS FOR POSTERITY.
A RECENT trade-announcement furnishes us with the welcome in-
formation that:—
. “Mr. HuBERT HERKoMER, A.R.A., has executed a large design for a
Pictorial Advertisement (size 11 ft. 6 in. by 9 ft.), in reference to which an
article will appear in the Magazine of Art for May, under the title of “The
Streets as Art Galleries.’”
We have not yet come across the Article in question, but we lose
no time in hailing the admirable idea suggested by its title. Qnce
give the Royal Academicians and their Associates the run of all the
THE ART-TREASURE HoARDINGs; or, HoARDERs PUNCTUALLY
AttenDED To BY H. HERKoMER, A.R.A.
advertising hoardings in the Metropolis, and there will be no more
| need to foster culture by Kyrle and other kindred societies. Indeed,
| culture will instantly become universal, and a mere ride outside a
twopenny omnibus, even without a catalogue, will, in itself, afford
an artistic treat of the very highest order.
Meantime, we are most anxious to know in what direction Mr.
|HERKOMER has made his first great advertising move. A sewing-
machine, for instance, or a new relish, would seem to require much
breadth of treatment, and very vigorous handling, when the space
at the command of the Artist has to be taken into consideration.
Yet such proportions as “11 ft. 6 in. by 9.ft.,” necessitating obvi.
ously recourse to some strongly tragic or domestic subject, and the
spirited introductiºn of several striking figures, would seem to point
at once to nothing less than an ambitious effort on behalf of a firm of
advertising tailors. . If this should prove to be the case, thousands
will be looking out for the appearance of the new advertisement
with the keenest interest, and it could scarcely be otherwise. To be
moved possibly to tears opposite one of Mr. HERKoMER's monster
posters, and at the same time be induced to purchase a “reversible
guinea Ulster as advertised,” will be to many, jaded with work and
unaccustomed to refining recreation, not only a novel but a pleasing
experience; and it is to be hoped that the work will not begin and
| end with Mr. HERKoMER.
| . Just think of what Sir, FREDERICE LEIGHToN could do with a
frºntage of thirty feet, his scene. “Olympus,” and his subject
“PEARs's Soap” Or imagine Mr. MILLAislet loose, in his happiest
vein of contemporary portraiture, on the “Statesman's Seven-and-
Sixpenny Hat”. Nor need the new artistic departure be confined
to Burlington House. Mr. BURNE-Jon Es could effectively push
a Patent Medicine by throwing all he knows into one of his charac-
teristic damosels, and writing under her the brief but significant
legend, “Before I took it”; while Mr...WHISTLER would be sure,
with equal facility, to make a fortune for any Mustard Company
under the sun. Outsiders, too—the rejected of the Galleries—might
at last find a market for their best allegorical and historic work.
“Cromwell looking at the Furnished and Unfurnished Houses in his
own Road” would make a capital subject for an º House-
Agent, and something advantageous to a well-known West End firm
might be got out of the legend of “Edgar listening to his ##
Swan's Song of the last Season's Novelties at Reduced Prices.” It
is on the whole, therefore, impossible not to look forward with lively
excitement to Mr. HERKOMER's forthcoming essay.
By the way, as when affixed to his boards these valuable works of
Art will become the property of Mr. WILLING, will he some day
present them to the nation ? And if he does so, what, some day,
will the nation be likely to do with them P Here is a question for
the umbrella-taker at the National Gallery.
SHAKSPEARE AMENDED.
MR. FuRNIvaLL is of opinion that the text of Hamlet known
to commentators as “The First Quarto,” furnishes a far better
and more compact acting play than the modern stage-version. He
and “a strong body of amateurs,” essayed, on the afternoon of
Saturday, the 16th April, at St.George's Hall, to convert the public
and the critics to their view of the case, ap arently with indifferent
success. Mr. FURNIVALL has sent to the Daily News what he calls
“a hasty try to set right” the celebrated soliloquy, “To be or not to
be,” in the Quarto No. 1: , Mr. FuRNIVALL's version is, of course, a
thing of beauty; yet is it hardly so jerky, creaky, odic, inco-
herent, scansion-proof-in short, so Utter, as in the interests of the
Bard might be desired. Here, therefore, is “a hasty try to set right,”
Mr. FURNIVALL himself.
To be, or not to be? There you are, don'tcherknow !
To die, to sleep! is that all? Forty winks?
To sleep, to dream Ah, that's about the size of it!
For from that forty winks when we awake
In the undiscovered cotton-nightcap country
From which no passenger ever took a return-ticket—
Why—ah, yes—humph!—exactly—very much so!
Who, but for what the vulgar call “blue funk,”
Would bear the rough and tumble of the world,
Be down'd on by the rich, plagued by the >
Married by widows, and by orphans worried ?
Who'd bear
#. east wind or June's perpetual rain,
The Income-tax, Lord RANDoIPH CHURCHILL's questions,
Middlesex Magistrates, Mud-Salad Market,
Crass commentaries on Shakspearian quartos
And all earth's ills, from FURNIVALL to toothache,
When that himself he might his gruel give
In half a jiffy? Who’d put up with it,
But for the thought of worse things turning up
In the Micawber Limbo—By-and-by *
Quite so! 'Tis bother, doubt, hope, fear, cant, gush,
The fads of noodies and of nincompoops,
Fogging the brain and flooring common sense,
Which make us grin and bear the ills we have
Rather than, a la FURNIvaLL, to make
“A hasty try to set ’em right.” Ah, yes,
'Tis noodledom makes cowards of us all !!!
SOLDIERS AND SHOTS,
So now, in consideration of experience in South Africa, dearly
bought at the hands of those pestilent º: the Boers,
British troops “are in future to be exercised in, firing at moving
objects at an unknown distance.” Hooray! Military authorities
have at length discovered that in serious warfare as well as in sport,
it is requisite to be able to shoot flying, in order not to waste powder
and shot. They might have suspected that practice at butts forms
no K. for making a bag at a battue, and that nobody learns
to be a dead shot at game on the wing, or on the run, or on the hop,
by firing at a stationary target. That is, if the idea had occurred to
their thinking minds. But that, in fact, the conditions of successful
shooting are actually the same on the field of battle as on the moors,
or at the cover, or in the stubble, or the turnips, or at Hurling or
Wormwood Scrubs, besides being of quite as much consequence-
before the unfortunate but instructive affair at Majuba Hill, who
would have thought it! However, a lesson has been learned in the
musketry-school of misfortune, and experience has made the heads
at Head-quarters wiser than they were.

A New Word for the New Dictionary.
THEY call it a “Scare,” and apply it freely to all forms of whole-

recent meetings in connection with the electric light. When gas
superseded bad oil, the prophets of 1807 had a similar word of con-
tempt; and, when steam-locomotives were introduced in 1830, the
prophets of the period were not deficient in language. Where are
they now?
“More Kicks than Halfpence.”
THIs ought to be the Motto for Lancashire. The other day Wigan
follºwed the example of Oldham, and kicked a man to death; and
to-day Preston has followed the example of Oldham, and kicked a
man to death likewise. Do the local newspapers º to check this

THE CITY COMPANIES” COMMISSION.
SATURDAY, the 30th, being the day named by the Commission for
the returns of the several Companies to be sent in, a meeting of
the Officials of several of the more influential of them was held at
Bellows'-Menders' Hall on Friday, the 1st inst.
Before, proceeding to business, the company partook of a most
elegant luncheon, served in their best style by Messrs. SING AND
RHYMER, Mr. M. MILNEs providing the dessert.
The Worshipful Master presided;
He commenced by assuring his hearers that the selection of the
special day on which they were meeting was a mere fortuitous cir-
cumstance, and not, as the ribald jester might think, the result of
careful thought and consideration; and as they were about to discuss
matters of rather a solemn and disagreeable character, he thought
perhaps before commencing that they had better have just one glass
round of the fine old Madeira, named from that monarch after their
own hearts, the lamented GEORGE THE FourTH.
This having been supplied, the Master continued. -
He had no doubt the difficulty experienced by his Company in
answering some of the *; questions of the Commissioners
had been shared in by all. (“ Hear! hear !”). They had ºt onl
very well with the “Foundation and Objects of the Company.” Of
course the Foundation was laid a precious long time ago by some

eges,” the first was of course very good and healthy, and the last
very comfortable; but when they were asked how much they got
for their services, they considered the question ungentlemanly and
inquisitorial-(loud cheers)—and their first answer had been, “As
much again as half.” But º perhaps that might be thought
somewhat equivocal, their clever Clerk had suggested they should
say “that it varied.” (Cheers.) And the same answer would of
course apply to their overworked and underpaid officials. (“Hear!”)
Then came a question that they had found it very inexpedient to
answer, namely, “What’s your Income?”
The first marily answer that would suggº itself to every true-
born and true-blue Englishman was "What's that to you?”
(Cheers.) Buthere again Prudence, in the shape of their clever Clerk,
º in and suggested that, as there were about 130 questions
with regard to their property, he thought he could answer at least
100 of them without conveying any information of the slightest
importance, and these he should propose to answer very fully indeed
so fully indeed that he should be very much surprised, as they would
have to be read by Government officials, if they would hear anything
more about them for years to come, and anything might happen in
that time. (Laughter.) -
Their one really great difficulty was this. They had, as he might
mention in the strictest confidence, an income of about £40,000
a-year; £25,000 of that they could easily account for, but they were
fairly Fº how to explain satisfactorily, to prejudiced minds

DISRAELI dead!. The trappings of late days,
The Coronet, the Garter, slip aside,
The Peer's emblazonment, the Victor's bays,
The pageantry of pride,
Triumph's mere symbols, badges of success,
Who weighs, who marks them now when all is said
In simple words, low-breathed in heaviness?—
ISRAELI's dead!
So all have known him from that earlier time
Of meteoric and all-daring youth,
And through the season of his dazzling prime;
And so to-day, in sooth,
'Tis BENJAMIN DISRAELI all will mourn,
Nor he the less Hºlly whose lance
Against that shield and crest full oft had borne
In combat d outrance.
The fearless fighter and the flashing wit
Swordless and silent! ... 'Tis a thought to dim
The young Spring sunshine, glancing, as was fit,
Bright at last on him,
Who knew no touch of winter in his soul
Holding the Greek gift yet in mind and tongue,
And who, though faring #. life's common goal,
Loved of the gods died young.
Like the Enchantress of the Nile, unstaled
By custom as unchilled by creeping years,
A world-compeller, who not often failed
In fight with his few peers.
Success incarnate, self-inspired, self-raised -
To that proud height whereat youth's fancy aimed
Whom even those who doubted whilst they praised,
Admired, e'en whilst they blamed.
No more that fine invective's flow to hear,
That buoyant wisdom or that biting wit!
To see him and his one sole battle-peer
Sharp counter hit for hit.
No more to picture that impassive face,
That unbetraying eye, that fadeless curlſ
No more in plot or policy to trace
The hand of the great Earl I
How strange it seems, and how unwelcome! - Rest,
Not least amidst our greatest! ...Who would dare
Deny thee place and splendour with the best
Who breathed our English air?
Peace, lasting Peace that strife no more shall break,
With Honour none may challenge, crown thee now
Wherever laid, not Faction's self would shake
The laurel from thy brow.
And England, who for thy quenched brightness, grieves,
Garlands the sword no more to leave its sheath,
And, turning from thy simple gravestone, leaves
A tear upon the wreath.

Magistrate. ToMMy ToMKINs is not singular in that respect, for I
am credibly informed, that GEORGE CANNING, though he came to be
Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, could never do the

SCOTLAND FOR EWER
(By that dear old Veteran.)
FAITHFUL to your instructions, Sir, and fortified by the handsome
cheque accompanyin §. last esteemed favour (it was a crossed
cheque, but my genial host, FRED RUMMIT, of the “Blacking Brush
Fox,” Melton Möwbra , changed it in a jiº, with the light-hearted
observation that he should like to have a lot more from the same
shop), I came up to town from the Shires, where I have been Boer-
hunting with my good friend, Sir AJAx HIGHLowgAME's pack of
oodhounds—only the Boers didn't see it, and gave us no end of
trouble—in order to inspect Mrs. ELIZABETH THOMPsoN-BUTIER's
icture of “Scotland for Ever!” otherwise the Charge of the Scots
reys at the Battle of Waterloo. Charge It is something like a
Charge that the gifted lady-Artist has so splendidly dashed off in the
true helter-skelter, head-over-heels, bang-up, “Go-as-you-Please,”
flash-of-lightning style. Our gallant troopers are charging so heavily
that you ; almost mistake them for so many Scotch hotel-
keepers attacking a body of tourists from the South. A grand
picture, Sir. I regard it as one of the most sumptuous examples
ever produced of what I may call the 'Ossification of the Art of
Battle-painting.
There are some wretched creatures, Sir, who call themselves Art-
Critics, and who have had the presumption to maintain that either
the heads of Mrs. BUTLER's dragoons are too small, or that the
heads of their horses are too large for their bodies. I should like to
; one of those Art-Critics into the hunting-field. , I'd teach him
ow to 'ware pictures. As I hinted to my distinguished friend, The
MAC SweLL, who, with Lord ALEXANDER MAC EDDON, and the great
financier and collector, Mr. JULIUS MACABEUs, was contemplating
with an expression of rapt ecstasy this truly tip-top, slap-up, boot-
and-saddle work, I have often been told by Sir Edwin (he painted
my rat-catching terrier, Bob), by HERRING, Senior (you know his
picture of my pink roan. Bloater, which should have won the Derby
in 1842, but was disqualified, owing to the perjury of a miscreant
stable-boy, who declared that Bloater was really an over-aged horse
called Qld. Soldier), and by HARRY HALL of Newmarket, that the
º: of a horse, especially if he be a Scots Grey one, cannot be too
arge.
Again, these caitiff critics (I should like to have 'em to myself in
the Shires and ask them what they think of a ...] appear to
forget (if the Cockneys ever knew) that, in the technique o there
is, besides the science of foreshortening, another, called “forewiden-
ºf. or “forebroadening.” The heads of Mrs. BUTLER's steeds are
alſ forebroadened. So are their hoofs. Besides, everybody ought to
know that the Scots Greys have always been mounted, not on ordi-
nary troop-horses, but on cart-horses—regular broad-wheeled waggon
cattle, Sir. That is why one of the words of command peculiar tº
this gallant regiment is “Woa!” and another, “Gee up, Dobbin!”
When the corps was first raised the men wore smock-frocks (of
shepherd's-plaid) over their uniforms, and haybands instead of high
boots; and it Fº not be generally known that the prodigious steeds
which dragged the funeral car of the Great Duke of WELLINGTON
were all Scots Grey horses dyed black and led by non-commissioned
officers disguised as undertakers' men. Who drove the historic
team on that memorable day it does not become the Veteran to say..
But the Old Man can say this, Sir, that he is an adept in Veteri-
nary High Art criticism. He studied it, Sir, under such masters as
DUCRow, FoalEY, HoRSLEY, Baron MARECHETTI, SANGER, BATTY,
and PoneyATowski. The anatomy of the donkey he learned from
Dr. AHN. Military draughtsmanship he acquired, from, PARK's

shºuld read PAYNE Knight on the art of pictorial glazing.
These, however, are only spots on the sun–or rather spots on the
nose of the Apollo Belvedere. Mrs. ELIZABETH THOMEsox-BUTLER
is an Artist * true genius; and the Veteran raises his hat to her in
singere and unstinted admiration. And, finally, Sir, it does me proud

LONDON CHARIVARI.
SPRING-TIME,-UP AGAIN :
AN EASTER-LY BLAST FOR MEDDLEVEX
MAGISTRATES.
GENTLEMEN,
THROUGHour the whole of the year your actions come more
or less under the unfavourable notice of the public, but it is at holi-
day times that your extraordinary muddle-headedness and your
incomparable incapacity attract most attention. What evil you
wrought this year on Good Friday I will not allude to, but without
our permission I will call your attention to the ways in which last
§ was spent, firstly, in the capital of the world; secondly, in a
provincial town in a third-rate country of Europe.
Easter Sunday A{{#ſ." in London.-All those who can possibly
afford it have left the City. The remaining Upper Fiye are in the
ark, the Zoo, their own houses, their churches, and their Clubs.
#. Lower Twenty are having it pretty much to themselves. With
much bad language, and not without physical disturbances, are the
public-houses cleared at three o'clock. The majority, whose pota-
tions have been hot and fiery, reel home, to sleep until wise laws
re-open the gin-palaces.
Easter Sunday Afternoon in Antwerp.–Upper Ten and Lower
Twenty all about. Being a holiday, the museums, and galleries
which contain the Art-treasures of this town, which the people—the
lower orders if you will—by being allowed to see them once a week,
can appreciate as highly as you yourselves, Gentlemen, are kept open
later than on week-days. The church doors stand, of course, wide
open. Painting, and sculpture, and carving, can be beheid by the
poorest. There are few working-men, I trow, in the old churches
of the City of London this day. Antwerp, as London, has its park,
but at Antwerp a band can be heard for nothing. The Zoological
Gardens here are not jealously closed on this or any other Sunday.
On payment of a franc all can enter. On a large open space stand
hundreds of small tables. Round them are seated whole families of
the smaller tradesmen of the town. They also are listening to a band.
They are committing the heinous crime of hearing the works of
MENDELssohn, Gounod, MEYERBEER, and, as an Englishman, I am
proud to add, BALFE. It is additionally saddening to have to relate
that without the formal falsehood of declaring themselves travellers,
these people are enabled to drink beer and coffee. Spirits also they
can have, but I note this carefully, they do not have them.
Sunday Night in London.—The gin-palaces doing a roaring trade
from six till eleven. Men spending their week's wages on heavy
drinks. Women lowering themselves more rapidly than the men.
Shopkeepers of the smaller class sitting at home, yawning, and
lºgº; or Sunday to be at an end.
unday Night at Antwerp.–The cafés crowded. The classes
corresponding to the two just mentioned—tradesmen and artisans—
being the principal supporters. Whole families sitting together,
from the grandmother to the babe. Large consumption of tobacco,
coffee, syrups, and of light beer. Music-halls alike full, and of like
classes. atever may be the restraints attached to the music-hall
proprietors, a decent man is not ashamed to bring his wife and youn
children to them. At the theatre a popular play by a Flemis
author, attracting a large audience. All is over before twelve, and
the streets between eleven and midnight are as orderly as at any
other time of the day.
I make no comment. I leave that to you. But I would advise
you to take note of what I have written, lest certain facts be brought
to your attention before long in a way more forcible than pleasant.
Yours truthfully,
THE HUSBAND of Georgiana (née Popsnap).
THE THREE R.'s IN EAST SUFFOLK.
THE Ipswich Journal gives some specimens of the questions put by
one of Her Majesty's School Inspectors in East Suffolk. Like the
Great Panjandrum at the Barber's Wedding, Mr. A. J. Swissues E.
H.M.I., seems to have amused himself by º at the game of
"Catch-as-catch-can". with the East-Anglian adolescents, who, if
they tripped not over his educational traps and pitfalls, must have
been as wary as well informed.
“Ships are said to be lost on the Downs, and sheep are fattened on the
Downs, where and what are the Downs?”
Here the Great Panjandrum was decidedly “down on” the Suffolk
Students, and it is to be hoped they were downy enough to dodge
his clever conundrum. Perhaps Hºn. thinks the Three R.'s º:
to be supplemented by a fourth-Riddles. Here are a few more of
his a posers:-
“What right has India to be called the Pearl of the British Crown?”
“If you wished to buy a great lot of crockery-ware wholesale for a large
firm, where would you go to?”
“If a gentleman goes to Holyhead, Harwich, or Folkestone, what place
would he most likely be going to sail to *"
“Why is it light sooner in Suffolk than in Cornwall?”
The latter question is for “Age 8, Standard II.” We hº
youthful encyclopædist to whom it was º being, happily, “more
than seven,” hit u what is obviously the right answer; viz.,
“Owing to the shining in the former happy county of a special
local luminary in the person of the Great Panjandrum of School
Inspectors.”
the
DANGERS OF THE METROPOLIS.
TRAVELLING BY UNDERGRound RAIL-Tug Roughs.
CERA PERENNIUS 2
MADAME Tussaup—we still speak of the present proprietary of this
world-famed exhibition as Madame Tussaud—has struck out a new
and peculiar line. She has advertised as one of the latestattractions
of her collection, not only the Baroness BURDETT-CouTTs, but also that
distinguished Lady's husband. Is not this a little over-shooting the
mark, or rather, the “men of mark,” to which, excellent Gentleman
in his way, Mr. BURDETT-CouTTs-BARTLETT cannot be said, and, no
doubt, does not aspire to belong? If the near relatives of notabili-
ties are henceforth to figure in a group, a large, if not highly in-
teresting field is at once open to the cereous artist. Such items in a
Çatalogue as-“Lord RANDoIPH, CHURCHILL, with his Sisters, his
Cousins and his Aunts; ”, “the Bey of TUNIs, surrounded by his
seventy Mothers-in-law;" and “Sir Robert CARDEN, M.P., incºn-
versation with his Second Cousin twice removed,” would naturally
excite the curiosity of a few intimate friends of the respective fami:
lies, but hardly arouse the enthusiastic attention of the general
public. “Mr. Bºr ” should be melted down
without any delay.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FRox
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Mowday Night.—House met again to-day after the Easter holi-
days. Great excitementoutside, funerealdulness within. The gloom
of the darkened rooms at Hughenden pervades this gaslit chamber.
House of Commons cannot readily forget the man who has been an
intimate part of its daily life as far back as memory goes. The old
business goes on in the old way. There are the old faces about, and
the old forms in operation. But the gloom and the sadness are evi-
dent. They will pass away to-morrow, and by Thursday the dead
hand will no longer rest upon the House, numbing the pulsation of its
life. To-night the feeling is unmistakable, and must find record here.
Pretty bit of comedy by-and-by designed to divert the mind from
mournful thoughts. GIBson opened Debate on
Second Reading of Irish Land Bill in a speech
that would have been twice as good if half as
lished. House likes good things, but prefers to
ave them at least look as if manufactured on the
F. Gibson declaims many impromptus,
ut should º them down written out on some-
thing less palpable than brief paper. Mr. RICH-
ARDson followed, but nobody ready to succeed.
Everybody waiting for somebody else. SPEAKER
rose to put the Motion. The Attorney-GENERAL
for IRELAND still regarded passing events with
that total absence of facial movement which Mr.
GoRST subsequently described as “listening with
a wooden face.” Debate about to collapse.
General consternation.
Sir RICHARD CRoss conveyed agitated signals
to Mr. WARton to do something. Mr. Warton
thought Sir RICHARD wanted ºia. of his snuff-
box. Handed it over. Renewed excitement on the
front º bench. Three ex-Cabinet Minis-
ters violently nodding their heads at the same time at the Member for
Bridport. Atlast picked upright clue, and proposed the adjournment
of the debate. Someone must speak to carry on debate till ten; but
who? Somebody said “WILLIERs STUART.” Everybody said Wrºters
STUART. Sir StAFford Northcote protested that the one unfulfilled
aspiration of his life was to hear WILLIERs. STUART, Mr. ForsTER
trembled all over his shoulders and down his legs with the energy
of his protestation that VII.LIERs STUART was the only man to throw
light on the subject. W. S., blushing under this unwonted interest
in his opinion, at length induced to commence speech. ereupon
everybody rushed off to dinner, leaving him literally an audience of
a single Member. But the debate was saved.
Business done.—Second Reading of Irish Land Bill moved.
Tuesday Night.—Some talk in town, I hear, of a minuet through
which the legs of Mr.
HENRY º
flash, but will under-
take to say our minuet
to-night beats anything
on any other Stage. Mr.
BRADLAUGH runs a little
more to flesh than the
great tragedian. But his
vigour and superior phy-
sical strength carry him
through.
It was an elaborately-
constructed performance
though simple in general
effect. First, Mr. BRAD-
LAUGH enters, and exe-
cutes a passeul before the
Mace. Immediately he is
joined by the Sergeant-
at-Arms, and the two
lka down the centre
till they reach the Bar.
Then BRADLAUGH, break-
ing away from his part-
ner, rushes downthestage - -
and strikes an attitude before the foot-lights. His partner, Captain
Gosset, trips gracefully after him; the two embrace, then retire a
few paces, joined by five other members of the ballet, when the
minuet commences. First, with slow swinging motion, the new-
comers hang on to Mr. BRADEAUGH, disclosing glimpses of white
º they playfully threaten to tear his coat off his
back. Then Mr. BRADEAUGH strikes an attitude after the manner
“Listening with a
wooden face.”
“Old Daddy Longlegs wouldn't say his prayers,
Take him, Black Beadle, and chuck him down-
stairs.”
of an ancient Roman. Mr. BRADLAUGH advances a few paces with
one of the other members of the ballet clinging to either hand,
whilst three others securely hold him by the coat-collar. Then he,
affecting to struggle desperately, retires two º draws right foot
up so that the heel rests on the instep of the left, and throwing his
head back towards his left shoulder, º but eloquently demands
of 'igh 'eaven what would they? What they would is evidently a
further dance, and the whole corps, still entwined as described above,
advance a few paces, retire again, revolve rapidly, and finally Mr.
BRADLAUGH and the Sergeant-at-Arms are left standing at the Bar
anting for breath, but bowing gracefully in response to the thun-
erous applause which greets the performance.
Business done,—First night of the Bradlaugh Minuet.
Wednesday.—Here is Mr. BRADLAUGH standing at the Table again,
and subsequently pirouetting back to the Bar in company with the
Sergeant-at-Arms. Reminds me of a distant relative of mine, one
Snarlevow, whose history Captain MARRYATT put into a novel. S.
was killed on various occasions, shot, hanged, drowned, and buried
under three feet of earth: , Always turned up a day or two after,
wagging his tail as if nothing particular had happened.
hought we had finished with Mr. BRADLAUGH last night. But
here he is again, and, I suppose, presently we shall have the corps de
ballet and the minuet once more.
In the meantime, PETER RYLANDs is on his feet, alternately
stretching out his hand to indicate Mr. BRADLAUGH standing at
the Bar, and shaking heavy forefingers in minatory manner towards
the placid Leader of the Opposition. If Mr. BRADLAUGH were a
wax figure, or a three-headed man just imported, and if PETER
were his proprietor, the attitude of the two could scarcely be varied
—Mr. BRADIAUGH standing Fº in full view at the Bar, and
ow the gangway, with hand out-
PETER at the corner seat be
stretched, indica-
ºf him.
n Eminent
Person on the Trea-
sury Bench will
have it that PETER
is most of all like
Mr. Pumblechook.
“I expected every
moment,” the E.P.
says, “to hear him
come out with the
very words Pum-
bleehook used when
he dragged out
º for inspection
and consideration.
‘Now, Mum, here
is this boy. Here
is this boy which
you brought up by
and, Hold up your head, Boy, and be for ever grateful unto them
which so did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy.’”
Business done.-Mr. BRADLAUGH further considered.
Thursday.—Mr. GLApstone begins to wish he had not so greatly
stirred Colonel Torresh AM to come back for the Second Reading of
the Irish Land Bill. The Colonel has brought a speech with him,
which he began early in the evening, and is now (11:15 P.M.) probably
half-way through. In point of length, Tottenham Court. Road is
nothing to it, even with Hampstead Road added on. The Colonel is
also making jokes. No one º him of this, and it was quite
some time before anybody laughed. Mr. WARtoN discovered the
intention first, then Sir John HAY, then the deep thunder of
Alderman Fowler's laugh caused disturbing vibration among the
ventilating apparatus beneath the Chamber. Next Mr. GoRST's
countenance was observed to be curiously distorted, and in the end
the jokes proved quite a success—at least, I suppose there will be an
end. Will look in to-morrow and see. -
Business done.—Colonel Tortex HAM debated the Second Reading
of the Irish Land Bill.
Friday Night.—Colonel ToTTENHAM finished, and PEASE and peace
descended on the House. Curious to note how far-reaching is the
effect of opium. None on the premises that anyone knows of..., LYON
PLAYFAIR, when he lectures on oleo-margarine and other pleasing
compounds, may have little pots of samples all over the table for
illustration of his lecture. No such privilege accorded to Mr. PEASE
when he brings on his Resolution denouncing the Qpium Traffic.
Nevertheless, when he begins to talk, Members placidly fold their
hands, stretch out their legs, close their eyes, their heads fall upon
their breasts, and before Mr. PEASE has been speaking for three-
quarters-of-an-hour, there is not a man awake except Lord HART-
INGTON, sole occupant of the Treasury Bench, who has to reply with
Ministerial responsibility. ... -
Business done.—Budget Bill read a Second Time.

that he has printed them with “only a few occasional reservations.”
He tells us, too, that he accepts the entire responsibility, and there-
fore, as what has been published has É. great pain to many
worthy people, has hurt the living and maligned the dead, and caused
a once venerated philosopher to appear as a spiteful and discontented
old personage, a reviler of every man and woman in a better position
than himself, Mr. FROUDE must be congratulated on the delicacy and
good taste with which he has edited the Reminiscences. He has,
indeed, left so much in which ought to have been omitted, that it is
a pity he troubled himself to editat all, and people are asking what
was taken out. Is it possible that the “occasional reservations”
only referred to Mr. Froude himself? Were the “requisite omis-
sions” anything like this:—
“In London among the blockheadisms again. Saw GLADSTONE,
one of the foolishest, most conceited, ever-babbling blockheads I can

Well, we’ve seen far better
and far worse than this. Stay,
Traveller, stay, and regard this
picture thoroughly. See how
it tells its own story. Look
- - at that spire, that little
pigeon-hole window high up in the spire, and look at the crimson
slipper that has evidently just been chucked out of that little win-
dow? And who is the chucker-out hidden from observation? Why,
the lovesick, bashful Curate, the unfortunate rival who has stolen
his ritualistic rector's ecclesiastical *::::::::::::: in some solemn and
picturesquerite—has ascended to that lofty window in the spire, and
thence by a sudden in-spire-ation has taken one shot for luck at the
figure of the bride now lost to him, alas, for ever, or a lass now lost
to him for ever, and has then fallen, back senseless, and got stuck
somehow in the º: where he will remain until they shall have
harnessed a horse to the bride's brougham, a most ºp. turn-out,
all but that item of the horse, which, in the hurry of the moment,
has been somehow forgotten and left behind in the livery stable:
The Artist's deep symbolism of “A-spire in the Distance” and
“A Spyer, up a loft” is suggestive of a
new ballad, “Maria and the Spire '''
And what will be the end of that love-
stricken, slipper-throwing, invisible Cui

right. But that person who said simply it was “Long's" has in-

a picture ourselves) we are in a better frame—of mind.

President, by himself—all by himself. It seems to be a design for
a MASKELYNE AND Cook ºn. representing the talking
head appearing out of a wall, and separated from the body below.
In this Exhibition there are several portraits of the President,
representing, as it were, the “Worship of Laton-a;” but it is for
us to point out that each picture conveys a double-barrelled compli-
ment, as it is impossible to represent the present President on canvas
without painting the portrait of a Late 'un. So on we go to

The Artist has evidently taken Lady
FANNY by surprise, and caught her ex-

back again as quickly as possible. I know
Ioughtn't to have been looking at them.”
But it was only the Artist who had come
to take her, so after all she was on the
wrong Sant.

how a i. of this class could be better occupied than in attending

I see how it is, this gi \ is clever, and you wish to push her on, to
send her to Girton College, perhaps to become a female wrangler.
Meanwhile, I am asked to punish this poor woman, not because she
has neglected her daughter's ...a...'. because she is compelled
from necessity to keep her at home to look after the younger children;
I think, although, as you say, the case is not provided for by Act of

THE death of Lord BEAcons-
FIELD having deprived the great
Deadlock Party of the charmer
who made them eaper to Liberal
º it may be well for them to
consider the advisability of pre-
serving the spirit he infused into
their policy. These are not the
days to go backwards, or to pre-
sent an obstinate front to changes
merely because they are changes.
If the Tories or "Conservatives
had not, opposed every social
reform which has been carried .
.# the present century, they i =
would not have languis so
long in the cold shade of Oppo-
sition. If they had welcomed
gas, railways, cheap bread, chea
newspapers, and other materia
improvements, instead of doing
all they could to strangle them,
they would have beaten the Libe-
seasily on their own ground.
It is always more respectable to
be a Conservative than a Radical,
and this is a country in which
respectability is a great motive
power.

HotDERs of brief authority in
various parts of Europe are dis-
pleased that England exists as a
safe harbour for political refugees,
forgetting that the day may not
be far, distant when they may
be glad to claim for themselves
what they now wish to withhold
from others. It is not many years
since that a great King fled to
this country under the name of
‘SMITH,” and ten years ago a
greater Emperor might have been
seen hobbling across an English

added to the collection ? It is not
quite the thing to put a funeral

THERE is no royal road to the

power of purchase, no hereditary
claim, * while those who pro-
bably think otherwise are strug-

undiscovered. When his time
comes, he will make himself
known—perhaps a man without
title or position or family preten-

trying on the clothes of the dead
giant, will at once recognise their

dates against the performance of Sagred Musie in
the unfortunate places at present under their con-

without a large amount of public and private
pressure—indignation meetings in Hyde Park, and
movements on the part of a few of the younger
Magistrates. The Seldom-at-Home Secretary also
contributed to the result, his sluggish attention
having been drawn to the scandal so prominently
that he actually caused a letter to be written by one of his private

THE sporting fraternity have made a discovery which promises to
add a new delight to the excitement of horse-racing. They have
found out that during a race on Epsom Downs the police are too few
and too powerless to iº the peace, and, acting on this knowledge
they have organised a series of prize-fights. The camp-followers
the Turf have always included all the representative rowdyism of
great cities, and now the thimble-riggers, cockshy men, and comic
singers are reinforced by what remains of professional pugilism.

Our (Reg'lar) Dustman (on first Monday in May). “Now, BEtsy, vich Is It To BE, MY DEAR
—THE HAHR-HAY, or THE GRUv'Nor 1"
ºw
MEMS. FOR THE MILITIA.
Meddle and Muddle Gen. Order, 29,432,721.
Department, H.G., W.O. "
Now that the Training of the Militia has commenced, it has been considered advisable by
the Secretary of State (after consultation with the Obstructor-in-Chief) to explain some of
the changes that are about to be made in that body.
It must be *H understood that although the Service will shortly lose the time-honoured
designation of “Old Constitutional Force,” they will under no consideration whatever be
permitted to share the rights and privileges of their Comrades in the Line. To effectually
emphasise this regulation, they will wear a large “M” on their shoulder-straps, which
be taken to mean “ Mutineer. “Muff,” or any other title of a similar character that a
would be contrary to the spirit of these
provisions,
By a recent general order it will have
been observed that certain Regiments of
Militia have been ordered to reinforce the
Line without the smallest regard to sur-
rounding circumstances. Thus the Reserve
Men of some Regiments will be sent to Win-
chester to act as rifles, while their comrades
at Head-Quarters are in London attached
to the Guards. This little arrangement is
expected to break the monotony of military
duty by causing some very, amusing con-
fusion. Again, in some of these cases the
uniform will be scarlet, in some green. In
the first instance the Reserve Men will in-
troduce a not unpleasing variety in the
a rance of the Corps to which they are
affiliated; while in the second, the officers
will quickl assume a remarkable resem-
blance to Bicyclists, Park Keepers, and
Commissionnaires.
As it has been represented that the Royal
Londoners are believed to enjoy
privileges as successors to the Train
it is not impossible that the Musicians
this regiment will be permitted to travel by
Underground when not in uniform at the
customary, fares. It must be understood,
however, that if this concession is made to
the battalion in question, the act of grace
must not be *:::::: as a precedent by other
and less favoured regiments.
It is not unli . that the Mess Property
of the Militia will ultimately become the
Mess . of the Line. In return for
this, no doubt the Militia will be permitted
to share the victories obtained by the Line.
These victories will be inscribed on the
colours of the Militia—when new colours
are issued to the Militia!
Finally, it is quite admitted that by the
New Regulations the Militia will lose much
of its prestige and most of its traditions,
that its Commanders will be put to t
expense, and its rank and file to consider-
able inconvenience. However, the Autho-
rities feel assured that ample compensation
has been afforded to all concerned by allow-
ing the officers to wear gold lace /
(Signed) ToBy,
Adjutant General of the Service
Going to the Dogs.
SONG OF THE SENSITIVE ONE.

private letter to Mr. BRADLAUGH to explain his
public protest.”—Parliamentary News.

BETWEEN THE LINES.
(By the Man who knows how to read there.)
TAKE my word for it, the dramatic ring in that speech of Lord
ELCHO's the other night shows what he has been doing. I'll bet ten
to one he has got a five-act piece coming out at the i.
Apropos of theatrical matters, if the interchange of characters
roves a hit at the Lyceum, the .. Manager will put up Mac-
th, and take a turn with everybody all round. His first venture
will be the Armed Head, in which he will be supported by Mr.
Booth's 4pparition. Kings, which I have heard are a creation.
All doubts about the destination of the vacant Garter are dispelled.
It goes to the Bey of TUNIs, and the * will be sent him in

GossET managed to get, BRADLAUGH to the ba; the other º
with five ushers. “I’ll have fifteen, next time,” said the lively
Sergeant to Sir R. CARDEN, who has been giving him lessons in wrest-
ling, “and then we’ll see who's afraid.”. Since BRADLAUGH heard
this, he has sat under the gallery with a life-preserver.
. GoRST's witty onslaught on the “wooden faces” of the Trea-
sury Bench has not been unproductive... He has been entrusted with
a commission to furnish designs for all the big heads in the next

SPURIUS SHAKSPEARIUS AT DRURY-O’LANUS.
WHEN, in Great Erpectations, Pip and his friend went to see
Mr. Wopsle, they expressed their opinion of that, great man's
Hamlet as being “massive and concrete.” So, when in great
expectations we went to see Mr. M'CULLough as Virginius, the best
description of his performance we can give is, that it is “massive
and concrete”—only that for “eoncrete” we should substitute
something more appropriate, and say, “massive with Roman cement.”
Thank goodness, º: Actors, merciful to the public, have shaped this
pinchbeck Shakspearian drama
into a good acting play; have
cutit to something like reason-
able limits, and, there being
weight enough during the Acts,
they give us no “waits” be-
tween them. Still, it is faulty.
Thereisexuberance of language
where actionismainlyre -
and not, a line to inspire the
Actor where action is neither
wanted inor * With
much against him—the play
itself to begin , with—Mr.
M“CULLOUGH’s performance is
dignified and impressive, with-
out any old-fashioned gasp-
ing, eye-rolling, grunting and
twitching; without the slight-
est Yankee twang, but occasionally with just the least taste in life
of a classic Milesian brogue that marks Mr. M'CULLough as a fit
exponent of the plays (should they ever be revived) of that eminent
classic Irish author, TERENCE.
He is the best Tragedian we’ve
had over from America as yet.
Mr. AUGUSTU's HARRIs would be
the very picture of the gallant
young Roman gentleman, Icilius,
were it not that his light Cam-
bridge blue toga, his lavish dis-
play of limb, his painfully fasci-
nating smile, his evident anxiety
never to be caught by anybody
out of profile, and his º
struggle into some graceful posi-
tion from which he may start into
a dance on his own account at the
shortest possible notice, are, on
the whole, rather suggestive of an
overgrown Cupid who has given up
his wings as childish, and who has
been taking lessons from a Parisian
ballet-master.
Mr. HARRIs, seems so nervously
conscious of his bare arms, and so
surprised at perpetually coming suddenly, as it were, across his own
legs with no trousers on, that his attentions to Virginia, have the
air of being generally apologetic for his appearing in this costume
at all, and his assump-
tion of earnestness is
A Youthful Member of the Roman
Harristocracy.
Captain Appius Crosstreius. I
must possess her!
Comic Client Claudius. All right,
noble Captain, you shall!
consequently spasmo-
dic. He will, no doubt,
play it admirably when
the fact that the Ro-
mans did not wear
trousers, has ceased to
startle him; and his
passion will rouse the
sympathies of the au-
dience when he has
uite forgotten to copy
that Parisian ballet-
master so closely as he
does now; when he is
able to denote the
irrepressible character
of his energy without
stamping his foot petu-
lantly as if he were
starting the galop at
the end of the Lancers, or urging some tired coryphées to come up in
time for a last Terpsichorean effect. Without these slight draw-
backs, Mr. HARRIs's Monsieur Ioilºus would probably be a fine per-
formanee.
The Roman Mob comes outstrong; every man with a stick; indeed
“THE VIRGINIANs.”
An Awful Stick on the Stage.
we never remember having seen so many sticks on the stage together
at any one time, not even at a Drury Lane benefit; and there seemed
to be a depth of meaning in that experienced old stager, Mr. RYDER,
as Ten-Taters, addressing this crowd of sticks, and telling them how
to act. Well, Pater Ten-Taters is the noblest Roman of 'em all.
Mr. BARNEs is the classic Captain Crosstree to the life, and the
villainy of Mr. DE LANGE, the Comic Client—evidently out of a bur-
lesque with the song and dance omitted
−would thrill the audience with horror
if it had not just the contrary effect of
tickling them amazingly. Miss Cowell,
as Virginia, is a quiet, nice little un-
assuming person, decidedly popular.
Mrs. ARTHUR STIRLING, as Servia, has
doubtless some high classical authority
for her costume, but it seemed to us
rather like what one might suppose
would be worn by a poor relation of
Hamlet's mother, when not in mourn-
ing, than by a roman Matron. Her
view of the costume for this character
might be considered as supported by
those of Virginia's uncle, a disreput-
able-looking person called Numitorius,
from beneath whose decidedly seedy-
looking second-hand Roman robe, the
rim of a grey trouser (one of a pair probably) was from time to time
distinctly visible to the stalls.
A Fight for Life-drama in three Acts, by Messrs. SAVILE CLARKE
and DU TERRAUx, founded on a novel of the same name by Mr. Mor
THQMAs, has been given at two Gaiety matinées, and achieved a
decided success. Mr. C. KELLY capital. See KELLY.

It is difficult to account for the want of intelligence and enterprise
shown by the population of London, except upon the theory that
people generally neglect the opportunities for, acquiring wealth
which may be found almost under their noses. The development of
these fields will employ the surplus labour of the East-End, and
thus commend the scheme to the practical philanthropist; while the
minute subdivision of the shares enables the smallest capitalist to
avail himself of a class of investment only brought, as a rule, within
the reach of bankers and millionnaires. The following certificate
from M. T. QUARTs, Esq., F.I.G.S., is the best guarantee of the value

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER,
RoBERT AT THE ROYAL ACADEMY.
For the first time in my long perfeshnal experience I found myself on
Saturday at the Royal Acaddemy Dinner. - -
I don't think upon the whole it's a very satisfactry place to dine in, the
picturs interferes with the Dinner and the Dinner with the Picturs, so you can't
give your whole mind to either. I don't know who was
the Arkitec of the buildin, but he must ha' knowed preshus
little about serving of dinners or he wood have made better
erangements than he has done for this, of corse, the most
important day of the year. By merely giving up one or two
of the Galery's as they calls 'em, tho’ I’m sure I don't
know why, he could have made it a splendid dining place,
almost equal to Goldsmiths' All.
It wasn't a bad dinner, nor a bad company, but the guests
was mixed. -
The one perfeshonal thought that forced itself upon me
while performing my umble duties was, how huniversal is
the love of Sparrow Grass. Whether it be among Royal Princes or Royal
Academy missions, among Home Ministers or Forren Ministers, among the Dra-
mandatic Professhun of the numerous but not humourous Parsºns at the
Manshun House, from the Royal Hair Apparent to the Poor Painter, they all
loves it; I don't enjoy it so much myself now they’re growed such a size
and such a colour. I likes my grass green as seems more natural.
As for the speetchis I quite agrees with Mr. GLADSTUN as there was too many
on 'em, but I wunder if he’d a liked to have left out his as a xample? Not
he, thinks I. Which his were more like a sirmun than a speetch.
The Chairman seemed a nice sort of Gent, and ain't at all a bad speaker,
and with a little more practice might do for the Washupfool Master of the
Painters' Company some day, but nine speetchis is what I calls overdoing
of it. |
Of course the LoBD MARE made the best s of the
evening, but they didn't seem quite to erstand it.
and kept laughing in the wrong places, but of course
they’re not quite used to that sort of thing, so their
ignorense was quite excusable.
And so ended the Royal Academy Banquet, and I’m
akshally told it will be quite 12 months . the poor
Painters get such another. For my part give me the
Painter as surplies the Tuttle-soup.
Poor fellows! how I pities 'em, it wouldn’t at all sute
my City patrons.
THE GROSWENOR GALLERY.
A LAY OF THE PRIVATE VIEW.
THE Grosvenor l the view that's called private,
Yet all the world seems to be there;
Each carriage that comes to arrive at
The door, makes the populace stare.
There's GLADSTONE, severe of demeanour,
It's plain that the pictures don't please;
And there, with an aspect serener,
Her Highness the Princess Louise.
The haunt of the very aesthetic,
Here come the º intense,
The long-haired and hyper-poetic
Whose sound is mistaken for sense.
And ..º. maiden will mutter,
When OscaR looms large on her sight,
“He’s quite too consummately utter,
As well as too utterly quite.”
The dresses! What thinks Mr. GILBERT,
Who's given us some dainty designs,
Of folds like the dead leaf or filbert,
That fall in such Florentine lines.
I trow on the whole that there's not a
Costume that looks better to-day,
Than wraps of a warm terra-cotta
Two elegant ladies display.
A frock that's the tone of a tartlet,
A hat mediaevally wide,
Must startle our BURDETT-Courts-BARTLET,
Who's here with his Baroness bride.
But come, we’ve the pictures to stare on,
And scarcely can see for the throng,
CouTTs-LINDSAY's remarkable “Charon”—
Another good DoRf gone wrong !
Here's WHISTLER paints Miss ALEXANDER,
A portrait washed out as by rain;
'Twill raise RUSKIN's critical dander,
To find JAMEs is at it again.
The flesh-tints of WATTs are quite comic;
There's HERKoMEB's chaos of stones;
But where is the great anatomic

Mowdar Night, May 2.-The great Crusader RANDoIPH once
more mounted his battle-horse, and put lance in rest against those
Paynims BRADLAUGH and GLADSTONE. House of Commons great
place for developing character. No one would have suspected this deep
and humble piety which inspires RANDoLPH. shows again how
necessary it is to be cautious, and never too, hastily to judge a man.
The former squires of the modern Crusader hang back a little.
Portsmouth and Chatham don't seem so decided on the subject of
Qath as Woodstock. But Derry is true to the core, and would have
the House close its gates against the Paynim as Derry closed its gates
on a historic occasion still annually celebrated by the smashing of
many heads. Mr. CHARLEs LEwis speaks for Derry amid enthusi-
astic applause from Mr. WARTON.
THE TREE AND THE ELEPHANT.
Mr. WARTON, by the bye, is forming a . It is called the
Snuff-Box Party, and at present, consists solely of Mr. WHITLEY.
It is one of the most united and faithful sections in the House.
Thinks its leader the greatest political luminary of this or any other
age. RANDoLPH CHURCHILL all very well in his way. But Mr.
HITLEY does not hold with your noisy chattering men, Give him

attack on the back bench. The snuff-box stormed. Mr. Monk led
the attack, delivering a speech that sounded so like a Bishop's charge
that the two Reverend Gentlemen who have seats in the #. for
the first time in their lives began to feel at home. The attack was
made under cover of a Motion to amend the rule which prohibits
opposed business being taken after half-past twelve. Mr., Monk
highly sarcastic. Avoided direct reference to Mr. WARtoN, alluding
to ; as “a gentleman of high position and long experience in the
Senate.” Mr. WHITLEY begins to think that, after all, Mr. Monk is
not without discernment.
Mr. WARTON acted with the dignity of a great chieftain. He dis-
dained to take part in a debate personal to himself, though when it
was mentioned that he had blocked every Bill, on the Orders that
Mr. BIGGAR had not previously marked for his own, and that on
that very day he had thus dealt with thirteen Orders of the Day
and four Notices of Motion, the crimson flush of pride suffused his
#. countenance, and, burying his head in his snuff-box, he
did not emerge for fully a moment.
Mr. WHITLEY says if this sort, of thing goes on, the Snuff-Box
Party will have to appoint, a Whip, like the other parties in the
House... He really cannot take on himself the full burden of work
which the prodigious activity of his Chief devolves upon him.
Business done.--Mr. WARTON charged with misdemeanor. Got
off by flaw in the indictment.
Wednesday. Afternoon.—Mr. BIGGAR has been thinking over the
case of the Chief Secretary. , Took, an opportunity this afternoon
of communicating result to deeply interested, House. With left
thumb in the arm-hole of his waistcoat, right hand extended the
better to point the moral, Mr. BiggaR “suggests” to Mr. ForsTER
“the propriety of withdrawing from a ition for which he is
notorºusly unfit.” Just the least tone of regret in Mr. BIGGAR's
melodious voice, as he mentions, this little circumstance. It has
Hºly wounded him in some past time when it first dawned upon
him. . But, in the meantime, it has become such a familiar fact, and
is, as he says, “so notor’us,” that time has §: healed the wound
and Mr. BIGGAR feels that other people, including Mr. ForsTER, wiii
be as callous as By way of hastening Mr. ForsTER's re-
tirement, Mr. BIGGAR thinks it well to put the screw on a little.
“I feel bound to add,” he says, .# that judicial phraseology which
in his mouth always calls to mind an ourang-outang wigged and
gowned, and seated on the bench of the Lord Chief Justice, “that
me and my friends will be under the necessity of speaking very
#.' about the Right Hon. Gentleman when the resolution of my
Hon. friend the Member for Longford comes on.”
The House tittered, but Mr. ForsTER did not seem to see any joke.
Sitting with his legs, stretched out at a Fºllº. angle, his arms
tightly folded, and chin sunk on his chest, he did not seem to
know that Mr. BIGGAR was ...

Mr. HEALY. This was a pity. Few pleasanter sights than to behold
the Hon. Member for Wexford with both hands disposed with loose
elegance in his trousers' pockets, and his pleasing countenance turned
towards the SPEAKER, the while he snaps forth a few flashes of
amiability. It is the proud and honourable boast of the Irish
Members that at some period or other they have all been in prison.
Mr. HEALY, by severe treatment of his hair, succeeds in conveying
the impression that he has only just come out. Also he wears a
truculent ‘. a matter not worthy of remark, except for the
significant fact that people insist upon speculating why he should
do so. In ordinary cases the º would be that he can
see better with it. In the case of Mr. HEALY opinion is divided
as to whether he wears it to spite Mr. O'Donnel L or to vex Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN.
To-night he flew at higher game. Lord HARTINGTON proposes a
vote of thanks to the gallant army of Afghanistan, which Sir STAF-
FoRD Northcote seconds, and, as it seems, all the House cheers-
Grand opportunity this for Mr. HEALY to flout the Saxon. Nobody
minds him, and Sir FREDERICK under the Gallery smiles genially

PHILISTIA DEFIANT.
(A Fragment of the Fiction of the Future.)
CHAPTER XLIX,
In which Æstheticism, assisted by a gº is the cause of a division
between friends.
MRs. WAMP's High-Art boudoir in South Kensington was arranged
and arrayed for the reception of a visitor, That visitor was BET-
sINDA GRIg—Mrs. GRIG, of Clapham Park—“a dear creature,” as
Mrs. WAMP would often remark, “though a quite too awfully utter
Philistine.”
Mrs. WAMP's boudoir was not a spacious one, but to the aesthetic
soul the Intense is the Unconditioned. What Mrs. WAMP's, boudoir
wanted in compass she made up in crockery, of which she had a large
collection, disposed in every *ely and lº riate position about
the walls thereof. For the Incongruous and the Utter are One ! The
pick and pride of this collection was for the moment a Teapot, an
entirely too precious monstrosity in Blue, a Thing-say rather an
Entity or Presence—-to doat on by day and dream of by night.
Mrs. WAMP, who had long yearned to divert her friend BETSINDA's
errant feet from the pathways of Philistia into the pleasaunges of
Art's Elect, had to-day urgently summoned her, to inspect this fic-
tile Portent, together with a pair of Japanese idols, a couple of blue-
mouldied bronzes, an etching by BRISTLER, a drowsy crayon sketch
§ SIMPLE SIMEON, and a new ballade by Bow DEwow. , Mrs. WAMP
justed her rust-tinted tresses against the verdigris-hued wall-paper,
twined her scant skirts into right classic, contortions, crooked her
elbows, cranked her knees, threw the needful expression of hollow
aghastness into her eyes, and had then finished her preparations
for the reception and conversion of the pretty Philistine her friend
even unto the setting forth of two spiritually edible lily-branches,
Intensely pallid.
+ + - - -
Mrs. WAMP reached the Teapot from its dusk retirement, and
placed it between the two lily-branches.
...Well, SARA,” said Mrs. GRIg,with somestoniness, “what is that?”
Mrs. WAMP's countenance expressing nothing more definite than a
hº agony of ecstatic absorption, BETSINDA added– -
“Is it one of the things they give away at lºgº.ºf tea
warehouses to every purchaser of their superior Souchong at two
and eight?”
“No, BETSINDA, it is not "'' was Mrs. WAMP's murmurously re-
proachful response.
..“Well,” said Mrs. GRIG, witn a short laugh, “it looks remarkably
like it, only more cracked.”
“BETSINDA,” Mrs. WAMP returned, with a glare of hollow yearn-
ing, “this is the finished fictile incarnation of the Utter. It is the
Symbol and quintessence, quite too consummately Too, of what that
dear MATTHEw ARNOLD sweetly calls ‘the eternal and unseizable
Shadow, Beauty.' A Thing to love, to languish over, to clasp and
covertly caress, to yearn intimately into, to classically attitudinise
around, to gasp and rapturously groan at, to pat, to pet, to paint, to
perorate about, to prostrate one's soul before, to hug in silence, to
worship, in company. In short, as the Supreme Symbol of the
Supernal, the uttermost utterance of the unutterable Utter, it is a
º, Live up to. Oh, my BETSINDA, will you not essay to live
up to 1
During this touching address Mrs. GRIG regarded the Teapot with
coldly critical disfavour. - -
“Well,” said she, with drawlingly deliberate acerbity, “it’s
dreadfully cracked, and horribly ugly; if that’s what you mean
by Unutterably Utter and all the rest of it. And, upon my word,
SARA, I think you must indeed be living up—or down—to it, for you
seem to get more decidedly cracked and more utterly ugly every
day.”
#. WAMP went more deeply, flº unbeautifully sea-green,
which is the AEsthete's substitute for a flush. ...For a brief space she
seemed to be agonisedly wandering in the spiritual Inane.
Then Mrs. WAMP resumed:
“The AEsthetes, BETSINDA—”
“Bother the AEsthetes!” said BETSINDA GRIG, .. -
Mrs. WAMP looked at her with amazement, incredulity, and indigna-
tion; when Mrs. GRIG, folding her arms in a manner more suggestive
of Madame Angot than of High Art, uttered these memorable and
tremendous words,-‘‘I don't believe there are any such people.’”
- - - - - -
Mem. by Scholiast of the period.—But there were ! Unlike her
celebrated antitype in circumstances somewhat similar, Mrs. BET-
sINDA GRIG had not hit upon the truth, the Æsthetes not, unhappily,
being, like the apocryphal Mrs. HARRIs, mere creatures of the
imagination. It is to be supposed either that Mrs. GRIG was driven
into desperate denial by the iterated urgencies of Mrs. WAMP, or
that she had been reading the Daily Gasometer, a sceptical and
superfine journal of the time.
Cross Purposes.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Two stars; or, Booth TogetheR.
Monday, May 2, was the first night of the Great Theatrical Event;
Mr. Booth as Othello, with Mr. IRVING as Iago. . Mr. Booth
began fairly—that is, if a gentleman of Othello's complexion can be
said to do anything fairly
--but after the first scene
he was as stagey as ever,
in the old-fashioned Mac-
ready-Phelps style, power-
less, and ºcasionally ridi-
culous. His Richelieu was
º plain,” and his
Othello is “two pence
coloured.”
On the other hand, Mr.
IRVING has never been seen
to greater advantage than
as Iago. Granting
mannerisms, which are, at
all events, his own, and
not those of a bygone
school, his Iago is a mas-
terpiece. His rearrange-
ment of Act IV. Scene 2,
however, brings the cha-

rather as a mischievous sprite than as a remorseless Mº istopheles,
who, be it remembered, performs much the same office towards
Valentine as Iago does to Cassio.

success of the evening, and went with, roars. . Here Mr. IRVING
showed himself not only a great Comedian, but also in his stage
management a master of pantomimic business, though we are st
doubtful whether the butter-slide, the red-hot poker, and the tradi-
tional business of the clown

all was so admirable, such a
suggestion, may savour of
ercriticism.
he fight between Roderigo
and Cassio was capital; and
when Roderigo was wounded,
and Iago, darting out from
hisº: door unperceived,
dealt Cassio a nasty one in
that part of his person which
at the moment, was turned
to him, and then craftily
disappeared, while Cassio was
trying to find out where"on
earth the attack came from-
the delight of the audience
knew no bounds; and finally, when on Iago being summoned by the
watch, the upper part of Mr. Iºving unexpectedly appeared at a side
window in the costume of a Corsican Brother's Ghost, it was unani-
mously declared that the climax of real fun had been attained, and

Grapes.
his hates Cassio F.And has
that nothing more intensely humorous had ever been seen on any
boards. Then, when Iago game out using very strong but Shak-
º language about the thieves, and kept up the Corsican Brother
idea by running Roderigo through the body and drawing out his
sword slowly, and with great gusto, as if he were Fabian finishing
Château Renaud, the audience roared again, and was fairly thank-
ful when the Curtain descended on this exhaustingly comic scene.
Mr. IRVING, as Iago, is as full of “business” as his acting-
manager and box-office keeper together, and the reckless way in
which he eats pounds of rare hot-house grapes, and chucks the
recious pips at the Prompter, gives the audience some idea of the
#. success of the Lyceum under his management.
As to the cast of the #. 42milia ought to be younger than
Iago, and of a certain s º style of beauty. For, after all, is
she not the one motive of the
entire play? Is not Iago's hatred
of the Moor on her account P Is it
not on her account too that he
not SHAK-
speaREhimself—who, at all events,
knew something of character—
iven us /Emilia's character in
at explanatory scene so carefully
omitted in the “acting versions”?
and has he not º shown that
Iago was not so very far out in his
suspicions of his wife's fidelity?
e Bianca Scene—revived by
FECHTER at the Princess's — is
omitted, and consequently the mo-
tive for killing Desdemona seems
inadequate.
Mr. MEAD's Brabantio was excel-
lent. Mr. TERRIss gay and gallant
as Cassio, but disappointing in the
drunken scene. r. PINERo as
the “foolish gentleman” Rode-
rigg, must have suffered much,
have been bruised all over,
as Mr. IRVING seemed to be unable . - - -
to resist an unaccountable temptation to give him strong back-
handers on the chest, and startlers on the back, whenever he was
addressing him. -
Miss ELLEN TERRY's Desdemona was graceful, but the “acting
version” does not permit sufficient of her to be seen for an audience
to grow so fond of her as to shed tears over her sad end behind those
private-theatrical bed-curtains. -
The House was enthusiastic for Mr. Booth-specially at first—and
for Mr. IRVING throughout. Mr. IRVING's Iago was a real triumph
and on the whole it was a memorable evening in our theatricai
annals. But the more we see of SHAKSPEARE's works the more firmly
we are convinced that while as a dramatic poet he was immeasurably
superior to any one living or dead—ALFREp of The Cup and Falcon
included—there was just one thing he could not do, and that was—
write a tolerable play for a nineteenth century audience.

REASONS AGAINST THE PROPOSED MONUMENT,
(By an Out-and-Out Radical M.P.)
1. BECAUSE, of course, Ifeel bound to object to anybody who raises
himself by brains and ability alone.
2. Because I belong to the “High Moral Standpoint” Party.
3. Because personally I have never been able to get through one of
his Lordship's novels. -
4. Because, while THACKERAY, THIRLwall, and GRote have their
Monuments in the Abbey, a man who has been twice Prime Minister
of England is too obscure to share the same honour.
5. Because Convictions are quite irreconcileable, with Courtesy,
and neither Generosity nor Chivalry come “within the sphere of
Practical Politics.”
6. Because PITT's monument was objected to by Fox.
7. Because, except when I choose to act independently, I am a

A NEW GAME.
A GAME so simple that it
may be played by children or
idiots has just been invented.
It is called “Badgering
BRIGHT.” You get a sheet of
note-paper, a pen, some ink,
an envelope, and a penny
stamp. On the sheet of paper
you write a $. con-
nected with FreeTrade, taking
care that the question is one
that has an obvious answer.
For example, you ask if it is
better to maintain a protective
tariff for the benefit of three
thousand people who produce
an article of food, t to
abolish that tariff for the bene-
fit of forty millions of people
who, buy and consume that
article of food. Having writ-
ten this question in plain hand-
writing, you send it to the
Right"Hön, join BRIGHT,
#. and ask for an answer.
You know beforehand what
the answer will be, but the
sport arises in betting on the
º and politeness of the
reply. Now that bull-baiting
and sº are made
illegal, this is an amusement
that may be safely, recom-
mended as a substitute, espe-
cially for wet days in country-
houses where there is no bil-
liard-table.

not permitted, to stir their

AN ACADEMICAL DIALOGUE
Overheard near Mr. ALMA-TADEMA’s Picture of “Sappho.”
Critical Lady (after examining it closely, to eminently critical and
wise-looking youngish, Gentleman). Charming, isn't it? . . (Wise
youth purses up his lips, and nods solemnly, as if not wishing to
commit himself by entire and unreserved assent.) Let me see—um—
which is SAPPHo?
Wise Young ſº (looking wiser than ever, and conscious of an
audience). SAPPHo? Oh—the-the–(hesitates)—why—(vaguely, and
without pointing)—that one.
Critical Lady. Which The man?
, Wise Young Judge (very cleverly pretending to be suddenly short-
sighted). Oh, is that a man? I didn't see exactl
Critical Lady (a trifle shaken in her belief in #. Wise Youth, and
also in ALMA-TADEMA as an Artist). Ah—yes—it is a man, I think.
But—(suddenly struck by an original idea)—was SAPPHo a man or a
woman P
Wise Young Judge (cornered). Well—(painfully conscious of utter
#. on the point, and aware at the same time of an audience
anging on his lips for instruction, tries to turn it off playfully,
ang, says, ‘;%. —was SAPPHo a he or a she P
Critical Lady (not to be put off). Which is it?. He or she?
Wise Young Judge (driven to bay, gives one despairing glance at
the Catalogue, but obtaining no inspiration from that, says, with a
cheerful assumption of honesty, as if unable to account for an odd
slip of the memory). Well-really—I forget what SAPPHo was.
(Audience, disappointed, breaks up and leaves, when he is suddenly
struck by a happy thought.) Oh, of course—she was one of the
Three Muses.
Critical Lady (quite happy now). Oh, of course!
Wise Young Judge (raising his voice, as if to recall the audience).
Yes—don't you recollect?—the Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece–
where Burning SAPPHo—(hesitates)—where Burning SAPPHO-(for-
gets the rest, and finishes airily)—did something or other—wept and
sung, or something of that sort. -

SHAKSPEARE ON THE “FREE LIST.”
In one of the earlier folios (we forget which, but probably Mr.
FURNIVALL knows) the following passage occurs, showing that the
great Dramatist, who was Actor, Author, and Manager, was occa-
sionally pestered for free admissions, and that the free list” in
those days was just as melancholy, dissatisfied, and ill-dressed as it
is at present.
“'Tis not alone our scarlet cloak, good Mother,
Nor rusty evening suits of dingy black,
Nor the dejected 'haviour of the visage,
Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief,
That may denote us .# These indeed seem
The husks and actions of the fools who pay;
But we have that within” which p show,t
Spite of our trappings and our suits of woe.”

“THERE is but one thing to be done,” said the Stockbroker deci-
sively. “Your Lordship must leave London for Nice—the Justice-
Room of the Mansion House for the Casino
of Monte Carlo.”
The Lord MAYon shuddered, and
turned pale.
“But how will the ſity get on with-

“Scores of Common-Councilmen will
languish, deprived of the Lord Mayor's
tea. They love to revel upon muffins and

man in a red opera-hat, “Still, you

“Done with you—in ponies!” cried the Stockbroker.
“Well, Gentlemen,” * the Lord MAYor, “be it as you will.

A week had passed, and yet nothing had been heard of the Chief
Magistrate of the City of London. It was known that he had
reached Monaco safely, and it was whispered that he attended the
gambling-saloons regularly.
“With all the arguments at his fingers' ends, he must convert
them,” said the Stockbroker. “All honour to the LoBD MAYor for
undertaking such a mission '''
The Betting-man agreed with him, and then the two friends talked
of the chances of the favourite winning the Derby, and that possi-
bility of a further rise in Mexicans New. . As they conversed to-
gether a letter was brought them bearing the Nice postmark. In a
moment, they had mastered its contents. The LoRD MAYon was
making his way—he had already seen the tables at all times, and was
well known to many of the croupiers. He hoped soon to abolish
gambling in all its branches.

1cally.
The words were scarcely uttered ere a footman hurriedly entered
º room, bearing a Telegraphic Despatch upon a massive gold
salver.
“What is this!” cried the Stockbroker, as he read the pink
paper. “All is lost Our last hope is gone!”
“Hum!'” said the Bookmaker, looking at the telegram. “Let us
see what he says”—

“This comes of leaving the pure moral atmosphere of the im-

And shaking their heads sorrowfully, the two men of business

SCHOOL-BOARD PAPERS.—No. 3.
In the City—before Alderman Goodfellow.
Present-The Alderman, Clerk, Usher, School-Board Officer,
Police Officers, &c.
Usher. Call MARY SMITH, º: comes forward.
The Clerk, You are summoned, Mrs. SMITH, for not sending your
son THOMAS to school. What have you to say?
Mary Smith. I've just to say, Sir, that the boy is over thirteen
year old, and has had book larnin enough, and is now at his work
and earnin nine bob a week.
Alderman. Is the defendant a widow P
School-Board Officer. Yes, Sir; she has three children besides
this boy THOMAs, who, as she says, is regularly at work?
Alderman. And that is his offence? And is he earning nine
shillings a week P
School-Board Qfficer. Yes, so his master tells me.
. Alderman. And you prosecute the mother of this boy because he
is earning his own bread P
School-Board Officer. Your Worship is aware that the Act of
Parliament makes no exceptions. The º must attend school until
he is fourteen.
Alderman, MARY SMITH, you have three other children, and this
boy is the eldest?
#. Yº, Sir; and a better boy there isn't in the parish;
brings his nine shillin to me every Saturday reglar. Your orship,
nine bºb a week mayn't be much to the like o' you; buttake it froß
us, and you may just send us to the workus at once.
Alderman. You say if we send your boy to school, we must send
you to the workhouse? . . . - - - - -
Mary Smith...That's just it, your Honor. It's hard livin as it is
wi' the nine shillin that ToM brings in, but without it we’d starve.
Alderman (to School-Board Officer). It seems a hard case. . .
School-Board Officer. The Board, your W.F. has no option in
the matter. The boy has not passed the standard prescribed by the
Act of Parliament.
Alderman. Is the boy's employer here?
The Master of the Boy comes forward.
Master. Your Honor, he has been with me for over three months.
A steady boy, writes a good hand and very good at accounts.
School-Board Officer. Not passed the fourth standard.
Alderman. That may be law, but it ain't common sense. I was
earning money myself before I was fourteen, and I ain't ashamed to
own it. I have no doubt that what the woman says is true, that her
boy's earnings are the chief part of her income, and you ask me tº
take it from her, not because he is not up in the three R.'s, but, I
suppose, because he can't tell the meaning of the three J.'s, or some
equally good reason. In any case, I don't feel justified in depriving
this poor family of their daily bread; and whatever be the con-
sequence, I shall dismiss the summons. .
School. Board Officer. Your Worship will grant a case for the
opinion of a Superior Court? -
Alderman (aside to Clerk). Superior Court! What does the fellow
mean P
Clerk. He has a right to appeal.
Alderman. So be it. More law, more expense; and all for the sake
of sending this poor woman to the workhouse, and thus imposing a
double tax on the rate-payers. First the cost of the appeal, and
then the cost of maintaining her if it succeeds. What is the next
case ?
THE WAY WE TALK NOW.
(From the Coming Conversation Book.)
“With the introduction of the Electrophone, distance will disappear, the
intermediary will vanish, and, at one stroke, every method of communication
be revolutionised.”—Scientific Gossip.
REALLY, the first act of this new piece at the Français has gone
capitally; and, here in Pimlico, in my shirt, sleeves.sipping m

The arrangement by which the whole,652 Members of the House
of Commons can now sit in the midst of their respective constituents,
and all talk at once, seems to me quite admirable.
My Serious Aunt is certainly right. It is foolish of me to have

Alderman Buncombe. Who is this Woman P
School-Board Officer. Her name, your Worship, is JANE Jon Es, and she has been

been spent on it. . I've always gone in for eddication, and so long as I'old this hoffice I'll
see that the Hact is obeyed.
A Solicitor rises in Court and addresses the Magistrate.
Solicitor. Please your Worship, I have been requested by a lady client of mine to appear
on behalf of this poor woman... But permit me, with all respect, to say that I agree entirely
with the opinion your Worship has so eloquently expressed as to the advantages of
education, and of which your Worship is so excellent an example (here the worthy Alderman
draws himself up with much dignity); and I may say at once, without circumlocution——
Alderman, Ain't that rather along word?

Sºlicitor, Far from it, your Worship, she has, I submit, a good answer to the summons.

occasionally plays truant.

sometimes whole days. I belieye what the
fºrman says, that it is not his mother's

Solicitor. Then I ask your Worship upon
what principle of law or reason you can
punish one person for the offence of
another ? If A. commits a murder, can
you charge B. with the crime P
Alderman. Well, it ain't a question of
A, or B., but of A B.C. (Loud laughter in
Court, in which the worthy Alderman
joins.) What does the lor, say on this 'ere
point? (Addressing the Clerk.)
Clerk. The Act, your Worship, clearly
makes the parent responsible for the
child's attendance in all cases.
Solicitor. But the law could never mean
that this poor woman should remain all
day at school watching her boy while he is
being taught.
Alderman. You mean for to say that she
would starve while he's being a-crammed !
(Loud laughter in Court, in which the
worthy Alderman again joins.)
Solicitor. Ha! ha / Your Worship has
stated my argument much better than I
could myself. But to be serious—if this
º woman is kept dancing attendance on
er boy all day, she must neglect her work
and starve.
Alderman. That is all * well, but
ou see we don't make the lor, do we ?
Addressing the Clerk, the latter shakes his
head.) If we did make the lor, I think we
could turn out better work than some
folks I know. (Some one in the crowd
ºf aloud.) Usher, turn that man out,
and I’ve a great mind to fine him for
contempt of Court 1 Imperence . . (Ad-
dressing the *ſº he continues.) Now
we’ve 'eard all that can be said for you,
but I’m bound to tell you that it amounts
to nothink. The lor must be obeyed. We
'ave no hoption in this 'ere matter. You
must pay a fine of ten shillings.
Clerk. Five shillings, §. Worship, is
the marimum fine under the Act.
Alderman. JANE JONES, you must pay a
fine of five shillings.
Jane Jones. Your Worship, I haven't
five shillings in the world.
School-Board Officer. I must apply for
a distress-warrant in this case.
Alderman, Very good. Now then, look
sharp ! Call on the next case.
A Forcible Reply.
THE Great Conservative Deadlock Party
say the country is being ruined '. what
they are pleased to call the “Revolu-
tionary Party.” The country replies in
the most unmistakeable manner by send-
ing up Consols to 1024–the highest figure
reached during the present century. Il-
sols are peculiar, ost to the verge of
rudeness. When Lord PALMERSTON died
they went down two-and-sixpence ; an
when Lord BEAconsfield died, even this
slender compliment was denied to him.

Mr. BRADLAUGH, who owes Mr. NEWDEGATE a grudge in respect him
of some action in a Court of Law, spoiled the sport by showing him-
self as meek as a calf. Came up in the º style to the table,
which with us answers the part of the footlights in other
theatres. The SPEAKER gave §. signal for the minuet. Cap-
tain GossET advanced in the usual style, claimed his partner as
before; Mr. BRADLAUGH retired backward to the Bar. Then he
should, according to directions followed on last occasion, have
broken away from his partner, and coyly tripped forward to the
footlights. Then Mr. NEwpEGATE would have stepped forward
from the wings, and the thing would have gone right. But
Mr. BRADLAUGH stood in depressed attitude at the Bar, and in
plaintive voice protested against mankind. After this he was
walked off. Tremendous clamour; people demanding their money
back; House suddenly shut up, and by nine o'clock all the lights out.
JBusiness done.-Mr. BRADLAUGH expelled, House adjourned at ten
minutes to nine.

with modesty. But to-day this # vanished in an access of sym-
pathy. RANDOLPH has lost his Little Bill. He died this afternoon
quietly.and, without a struggle, insensible, it is to be hoped, to the
jibe which that Parliamentary sapeur, the sitting Member for North-
i. flung across its death cradle. The Little Bill never was a
healthy child, and immediately after his birth he received a blow on
the head from one of his reputed parents, from which he never
recovered. When Mr. GoRST thus unnaturally spurned and forsook
him, RANDOLPH took him up, and has nursed him gently for many
months. But he was hopeless from the first. Perhaps he was a
little overweighted at the font. No infant, save of exceptionally
strong constitution, could survive such a name as he was fondly
dowered with. Perhaps RANDOLPH is more capable of assisting in
the massacre of other people's innocents than in the rearing of
his own. However it, be, the little one died this afternoon, and
the House observed with respectful sympathy the parental anguish.
Frail offspring of concentrate thought,
Called hence by early doom;
Came but to show how weak a flower
In such strong soil might bloom.
Business done.—Lord RANDolph, after debate, withdraws the
Recovery of Small Debts (Limitation of Actions) Bill.
Thursday Night.—Another sleepy night with the Irish Land Bill.
Mr. SHAw justified Lord ELCHO's one i. thing in an hour's speech.
He is, as my Lord said, among Irish Members the three S's—Sober,
Sensible Shaw. A fresh and welcome contribution from Ireland in
Mr. MACNAGHTEN. The Member for Antrim has the peculiar facial
quality noted by Mr. GoRST (under correction from the PREMIER) in
another Ulsterman; Mr. LAw. He is essentially," wooden-faced.”
But this adds greatly to the salt of his humour. He says odd things
in a dry voice and with expressionless face. His jokes have about
them the quality of surprise which would be occasioned by a few sen-
tentious remarks from one of the stone figure-heads carved about
Westminster.

The laying down of a memorial wood pavement in the Borough

The placing of a memorial leathern porter's chair at each end of

Confessing that he knew not aught of heraldry she'd teach:
And many a lady in the land might learn from Mistress Di,
Of all heraldic science tells, and mysteries that lie
In Metals, Colours, and in Furs, the pleasant lore of old ;
And where the Tressured Lion ramps upon the shield of gold.
Let metal not on metal stand, except on varied field, , ,
Although the golden crosses lie on GoDFREY's silver shield:
In marshalling you quarter arms; or should you take a bride,
You bear the lady's coat per pale, your own on dexter side :
But if that wife an heiress be, her friends will take offence
Unless you place her arms on an escutcheon of pretence.
Fair shines the shield that's blazoned well, while knightly crest and

Combine to show the bearer's rank and place within the realm;
And Hº! heraldry will teach, how in old days 'twas said , .

BETWEEN THE LINES.
(By the Man who knows how to
Read There.)
AT the election of the two
new R.A.'s at Burlington
House, the other day, there
was the usual scene, and the
proverbial hat, election papers,
and Secretary's table were
knocked over in the scuffle.
The objection was to Mr.
RIVIERE's French origin.
Just as the police were about
to be sent for, the President
wittily remarked, “A French-
man, Gentlemen, why, he is
the best Bºrros of us' aii!?
In an instant there was hand-
shaking all round, and the
new R.A. was elected.
The Laureate looked over
the poems sent in for the Cal-
deron Ode to the Spanish Am-
bassador; and, finding not one
worthy of the prize, shook his
head., “Well, then, perhaps
I shall have a chance,” said
the smiling Diplomatist, hand-
ing in a copy of his own lines,
and earnestly pressing the dis-
tinguished judge to stay to
dinner. But the Laureate
merely scanned the paper, and
rejoined “Perse and rerse.”
When this bon-mot was tele-
§ to the young King at
adrid, he instantly replied,
"Give the man who majºr
five pounds, and return me the
balance.”
“QUITE Too Too!”—In the
present crisis in Art, may a
man who does not understand
“AEsthetic” language be de-
scribed as “one who can’t put
two and two together”?

with an American § ce
BIsMARCK, that Germany
would become a united count

e has certainly won, a
which instances his §:
and attests his foresight, not
only of his country's future
but likewise of his own, an
that of the other party also:
the destiny of both himself
and that other to live, the
former to win, the latter to
lose, the five-and-twenty bot-
tles of Cham e. Five-and-
twenty, by the way; not two
dozen, the ordinary bet of
bottles, but two dozen and
one. There is said to be “luck
in odd numbers.” The Great
Chancellor is credited with a
belief in luck. Does this
explain his wager?
Take your Physic.
THE House of Commons, in
its dealings with Mr. BRAD-
LAUGH, is like a * boy
who quarrels with his physic.

low his jalap, but fights against
it as long as possible. Mr.

THE STAGE IN MOURNING.
THEATRICAL Managers are the most imitative race of beings under
the sun. A foreign Actor, named SALVINI, discovered an old play
called Othello—a #: that is far less coarse in
Italian than in English. He had a magnificent
voice-like a church organ, and represented the title
character #. called a rôle) like an inspired
butcher. He became the rage. A brother foreigner,
named RossI, followed, and became a failure. Mr.
IRVING followed, and was not a success. Mr. Booth
arrived from America, and hardly succeeded. Again
- Mr. IRVING tried Othello, this time with Mr. Booth,
S each Actor alternating the parts of Othello and Iago.
J%- Mr. McCULLOUGH, just arrived from America, must
- black his face at Brury Lane, and an amateur, who
evidently thinks the part mere Child's play, must take a theatre to
do the same thing at matineés. Three Othellos in London in one
week, and i. y more to follow ! Who shall say that this is an
age which despises antiquity?
Heads and Tails.
(A Query for Mr. Darwin.)
[A. Medical Gentleman at Manchester expresses his absolute conviction—
based on the testimony of hatters, who find increasing demand for hats of a
smaller size,_that the adult human head is in course of diminution.]
MAKE answer, O Science, for courage quite quails
At a prospect which fills us with tremors and dreads:
If Apes became Men by slow loss of their tails,
at will Men become by slow loss of their heads?
THE MODERN TORTURE OF THE BOOT.
MR. Bushby, in sentencing a ruffian for the too free use of that
popular institution the British Boot, remarked that there was an
amount of savagery about the act of kicking which he always visited
with the utmost penalty provided by law. Quite right, Mr. Bush Ry,
and if the law provided a much severer penalty for this particular
offence, honest men would rejoice the more, and helpless women
might suffer less. Ez pede Herculem may now be freely translated,
º Brute is known by his Boot,”—or his use of it; and if the
apers continue to be as full of cases of cowardly kicking as they
º: been of late, public opinion will demand that the h
Hercules of the slum shall have his hide—the only sensitive º: O
him—as urgently appealed to as though he had had an hour's
experience of the effects of Nessus's shirt.

Brown. How uncommonly well the Tories have treated BRAD-
LAUGH ! -
Jones. Eh? what?—treated him well? They don't allow him to go

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER,
THERE's one thing as I misses more than I thought I should, and
that’s my Old Bailey Dinners. They has been done away about two
§. to my great regret. We always used to
ine the Judges, and the Sheriffs, and the Lawyers,
and a lot of people once a month at the Old Bailey,
and one of the Aldermen used to take the Chair,
and the Newgate Calender Ordinary used to be
the Vice, and I’ve heard some of the best jokes
and bits of real fun at these dinners as I ever
heard anywheres. The only thing they never
had, in my time, was Champain, and that arose,
BROWN told me, from the popping of the corks
having been sometimes heerd in Court. Many a
time have I heerd one of the Judges a telling a
- jolly good story, or a chaffin one of the counsil, I
think they calls 'em, about his speech, and ...'. laughin away
e fun, when just in the midst of it, in would come the Husher,
and say in sollen tones, “Please, your fordship, the Jury’s ready!”
Oh, to see the sudden change in his Lordship as he put on his Judge's
robe and his Judge's face, it was as good as a play, and a good deal
better than many on 'em. It was somethink like acting that was.
I used to think as º, used to pass their sentences a little quicker
if they hadn't quite finisht dinner, but I dessay I were wrong.
dº know is they was all very serious for about ten minutes after the
Judge came back, but it soon wore off and they were all as merr
as before... There seems precious few things as we can't get us
to, but I should ha’ thought that giving a poor fellow seven years,
or even wuss, would have taken away any #; appitite.
But the true fack is, tho' folks don't like to confessit, that the best
of men, the wisest, the piousest, ain't no without his Dinner!
If the world was a just world it would pay more respeck to two
of the most useful klarses of the whole kummunitty—Cooks as cooks
our dinners, and Waiters as serves 'em. (Signed) Robert.
A TURN OUT AT TIRNOWA.
(Leaf from H. S. H. Prince Alexander's Diary.)
1879,-TRIED Crown on for first time to-day. Fits capitally with
a piece of blotting-paper at the back. New Constitution arrived in
evening from Printer. Read it through. Capital. Nothing left
out. Prerogative, Upper and Lower House, trial, by jury, Levery-
thing there. My Coronation Oath, quite too lovely. Took it
freely. ... Had my first two years' salary in advance. Enthusiasm
indescribable ! Feel quite “the popular Prince.” Evidently I’m
in for a good thing.
1881,–Can't stand this any longer. Won't. Had to open Par-
liament myself with the back-door key. Not a Minister to be seen.
Cabinet busy appearing in a Negro entertainment at Casino Gar-
dens. Everything at a dead-lock. Went down to Treasury with a
carpet-bag, §: found Lord Chancellor had already got hold of that.
Feel this kind of thing Qught, not to go on. Happy thought—cou
d'état. Have appeared at Palace window, and proclaimed myself
Dictator / Nobody cares. However, here goes to put the Consti-
tution on the kitchen fire! And to-morrow we'll just have a look in
at the National Bank. To bed quite lively.
Marvels of Science.
A CoNTEMPORARY reports that at the annual reception given
recently by the President and Council of the Royal Society, amongst
a variety of scientific instruments, objects and apparatus:-
“Some relics of Sir WILLIAM HERscHEL's work were exhibited, one of
the points of interest in connection with them being that no one could say
why they were made or what they were for.”
Omne ignotum pro magnifico. That was one of the points of
interest. But what were the others?

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE CAP-AND-BELL BALLADS.–No. 1.
A PLAIN MAN.
HE was a Briton, therefore brave and bold,
('Tis the first law in Patriotism's code),
His firm-cut chin displayed a triple fold,
His name, in full, was UGHTHRED BANTAM BLODE;
His port was calmly proud, his standing stable
As º: of Atlas in the classic fable.
º For classic fable, I should here remark,
He had a solid and supreme alm,
He wholly scorned the nonsense vague and dark
Qf what is known as the “poetic strain.”
While as for bards, and their pernicious bunkum,
In the Red Sea—like ghosts—he would have sunk 'em.
Indeed, the ruling idiosyncrasy
Of U.B. BLodF. was judgment stern and summary
For trivial things like Taste, or Poetry
Art, Sentiment, and all such foolish flummery,
His only greeting was a Jovian frown,
His simple ultimatum—“Put 'em down l’”
You see he had put down so many things,
His wife's desires, his children's wants
and whims, -
All that the heart or fancy warms or wings,
Higher than Yº..." sums and Sunday hymns,
That he began to deem his crowning duty
Was putting down what idiots called “Beauty.”
He cast about for the most ready mode
Of furthering this philanthrºpic plan—
“Let’s see!—I have it ! ...Yes!” cried U. B. BLoDE,
“That drivelling, Lordly-Palace-building man
In Mister TENNYson's limp lyric twaddle
I'll quite surpass, but on a different model.
“‘Palace of Art' Preposterous ! I’ll rear
A Plain Man's Palace, home of Common Sense.
It shall hold nothing picturesque or queer,
The fº called ‘prettiness’ on no pretence
a
libºdmºthere, frºm iºnocker—"
It shall conform to the stern rules of CockeR.”
He hired an Architect. The man was r;
He shuddered at the scheme, but i. “I’ll try.
I’ve planned suburban villa blocks ; what more
By way of training to the hand and eye
In solid tastelessness could well be looked for 2
Lead on 1 I'll buckle to the task I’m booked for.”
* - - -
Four-square it rose upon a spacious flat
Of what had been suburban market-ground,
Smooth and symmetric as the British hat,
Euclid in brick and stucco. Schoolboys found,
As §§ in passing haply paused to con it,
That they could work out all his problems on it.
Big as a barracks,—U. B. Blope was rich, I}}|I||
ld as an iceberg, -U. B. BLope was British, I
Smooth as a bald head, dull as a Dutch ditch, =>~7-
BLode with triumphant joy grew almost skittish ; _r-
But soon as the bare carcase was erected,
, BLODE met with obstacles he’d not expected.
Beauty looked in one morning. BLope with ra
Grew pickled-cabbage colour. Beauty smiled.
Said she, “Since utter war with me yº wagº,
I must accept the challenge. Don't look riled,
Norbeck your Man in Blue, with thickshod feet,
He'll own that Beauty is not on his beat.”
Poor BLODE | As well have set all Scotland Yard
To º. a ghost as run her in.
His vigilance was vain, and he tried hard
To dodge, evade, exclude her, or to win
That bald Batavian barren bit of waste
Entirely from the sway of her and Taste.
The house grew hideous enough to please
A City Architect, or Dragon builder;
Its furnishings a white bear's soul might freeze,
He drove his paperhanger and his gilder
Mad with demands for things which nothing owed
To Beauty, e'en from Tottenham Court Road.
And Beauty foiled him; here her finger laid
Upon a cornice, there upon a fender,
Lending to fabrics of Philistine trade
Chance touches of the graceful, comely, tender.
And BLode discovered, with dismay and dolour,
Beauty was there, lurking in Form and Colour.
Things would look pretty somehow, here and there;
The picturesque itself cropped up in places.
And then his wife, she soft auburn hair,
His very children some stray childish graces:
Grass grew, trees budded, and, with no apology,
Beauty stepped in,_disguised as Meteorology.
- * - * -
BLode, baffled, beaten, took the blow to heart,
And pined away, and perished Pºly,
Resigned with such a foolish world to part
Where Ugliness can never reign securely.
... Aid I live longer,” sighed the luckless elf,
“Who #y. ? — I might grow Beautiful my-
self.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
PARIS : SALON AND THEATRES.
“PARIGI./ O cara,”–0 dear Paris! Yes, not dearer than London,
and what matter when we had determined to give Burlington House
Academy a rest and to let the gay Parisians flash on us for few brief
moments like bright ap-Parisians in their own
Elysian Fields P
Two francs in the morning to see the Salon.
This keeps it select, cool, and comfortable up to
midday, when in comes the crowd which gives
a franc opinion. The Authorised Salon Cata-
logue, illustrated, is most inter-
esting as a memorial of the visit.
Why does not our Academy do
likewise? Is it because there is
a difficulty of selection ? If so,
how is this overcome by the
Committee of the Paris Salon f
Mr. HENRY BLACKBURN's Aca-
demy Notes supplies a want;
but an authorised edition, care-
fully got up, and on sale at the opening of the Aca-
demy, might be a valuable work of Art in itself.
Let us take the first morning at the Salon:—
No. 911. Foubert. La Source: “Not Sauce,’”
said 'ARRY: “it’s chic.” Any visitor referring to
the original will see that we have added a little dress-
ing of our own to this Source.
No. 1123. , HEIIL. Un Suicide par Amour, . A young lady, who
has evidently “thrown herself away.” The dress is rather short,
and she is only waiting for a train to finish
Au Café de la Paix.
No. 911.
2-, it. But why not “Entrainée.” ” That
- 2 would have been the simpler title.
--- ić iii. No. 1126. HENNER. Saint Gérôme.
z- !'; It seems to have been suggested by
__*. Got NoD's “ Funeral March of a Ma-
2-2. S rionette,” — this being the Marionette
%;ºs y at its very last kick. This exactly
£7 º ~ describes Mr. HENNER's view of what
ſ Saint Jerome ought to have been, only
No. 1123. in a Henner-vated condition. Whether
the Artist is quite right, “according to
CocKER,” as the saying is, we
don't know; but of course it is
correct according to HENNER.
Woa, BENNER!
Advice to those who will pro-
bably be in Paris, for the Grand
Prix:—Don’t fail to see Les
Poupées de L'Enfante at, the
Folies Dramatiques. It will, of
course, done in London, but
it never can be played and sung
so perfectly as it is here. Mlle.
SIMon-Girard as Mariana, and Mlle. FRANDIN as her lover, Manoël.
are the most fascinating pair we’ve seen for some time;, Les Poupées
is void of all offence, and is far better in every way:-this important
particular included, than La Mascotte at the Bouffes.
We will now pay our second visit to the Salon:-
No. 1212. JAzer. Le Boute-selle. “Shall I give you a lift?”
or, The Merciful Man is merciful to his Beast. It shows how a horse
may be elevated by a couple of hands.
ſº
No. 1212.
.No. 1396, Lehoux (P-A.-P.) H. C. It is called Mars, but the
Picture rather suggests the triumphant entry into the village of an
No. 1396.
Acrobatic Professor and his trained troupe of performing birds and
animals. . He carries, a property-head for some particular Circus
business, in a trick to be called “Two Heads better than One.”
No. 1517. MANET. Portrait de M. Pertuiset, le Chasseur de
Lions. It's a wonderful picture this. The artful lion lying behind
the tree in a dog-sleep is just going
to show M. PERTUIs Et what it is to
be a Chasseur de Lion. An immor-
talwork—c'est d dire “Litera “pieta'
Manet.” But we wouldn't recom-
mend such a lion as M. MANET to
put himself within range of Le
Chasseur's gun.
No. 1823. PERRET (A.) Ex. Le
Semeur; i.e., The Sower. We have
seldom seen a so-so-er picture, but
as this is a Sower subject with the
Artist, we will only say that if we
had had to describe the picture
without any guide-book, we should have
said it represented “a man practising
roundhand bowling in an open field,
while his wife in the distance urges
forward the wild career of a perambu-
lator.” The title in English would
have been “Tom Bowling.” (N.B. Not
“Tom Bowles,” of Vanity Fair, whose
portrait is in our Academy.)
Those whom Providence has blessed
with affluence, we strongly recommend
to take seats at the º: for Le
- Monde of l’on s'ennuie. The Comedy
is mainly a satire on a clique-ish Mutual-Admiration Section of
Society formed of pseudo-philosophers, men , and women ...of
“culture,” neglected poets, gushing journalists, interested, toadies
and the uninteresting but #ºf toadied, of which the very
counterpart probably exists in every great_capital. We certainly
have it here, both with the Pseudo-AEsthetics and Pseudo-
Scientists; the former, on account of their high-art absurdities in
manner and costume, being more, en écidence among ourselves just
now than the other idiots, who of the two are perhaps the most mis-
chievous. The tendency of the Pseudo-AEsthetes, chez nous, is towards
the cultivation of a sickly sentimental paganism; while that of the
Pseudo-Scientists is towards a stupid, contemptuous, self-satisfied
materialism. It is difficult to satirise the latter on the stage; they are
easier dealt with in a book. Of plot Le Monde oil l’on s'ennuie
has very little. The original cast, with CoquELIN in it—he is away
now—was perfect, with the exception that M. DELAUNAY has more
the air of a “got-up” old beau, than of a veritable jeune premier,
Yet, for how many years has he not been accepted as our “first
young man” at the Français? ...And, after all, who is there among
the youngsters can make love with tears in his voice like the ever;
een Dei. Aunay Mlle. SAMARY is admirable as the ingénue, and
Mme. M. Brohan's impersonation of the spirituelle old Legitimist
Duchess, is the very perfection of refined dramatic art. The stage
management of the Second Act might be improved. . The Français
Company are not all in one line, each having a line of his own—and
when they are so arranged the effect is decidedly bad. ...
DAUBRAY and Cf. LINE CHAUMont have been º: Divorçons at
the Palais Royal for the last four months: but to those who have not
yet seen it, we strongly recommend the first two Acts. The third
is plotless, spun out, and unnecessarily broad. The two Acts are
simply a development, with a modern application, of the old piece
known here as helicate Ground, a great favourite,with amateurs.
But oh, those horridly uncomfortable Parisian Theatres ! If there
were a fire, the scene would be º, fearful. Already the
Authorities are beginning to consider whether, they can't imprºve
them a little. But material improvement is absolutely impossible
without entire reconstruction. In the most recently-built theatre,
ia Comédie Parisienne, all the old stereotyped inconveniences have
been repeated. Even the seats at the Français offer no exception to
the rule of discomfort; and everywhere the nuisance of the attend-
ants rushing at you for your coat and hat, and with a “peti, bane pour
Madame,” is iß. When will they inaugurate, the system
of "No fees,” and give regular "bills of the play,” with full cast of
characters, as we dohere, instead of allowing the visitor tº change the
purchase of an Entr'acte, an Orchestre, or a Paris Spectacles? On the
stage at the leading theatres they have the advantage in most cases
(scenery excepted) over us; but in the frºnt of the house they are
miles behind every one of our West End Theatres, except, perhaps,
the Strand.

been garçon-en-chef at a restaurant I used to patronise in the neigh-
j of Leicester Square until I was compelled to leave there on
account of their insisting—but no matter—the doors of the Palace
were open to me. The Bey was seated on a divan—you know what
a divan is, of course—nothing like a º: but a sort of L
well, if you know you know, and if you don't, explanation would
take too long—so there he was, seated on his divan, smoking and
sipping the fragrant Mocha from Mecca—(it's H. : here
“Mucca,” and when Mahometans perform a p §. to the
shrine it’s called “going a Mucca.”)—as sulky and despondent as
he could be. - -
“O Bey !” I began, saluting him orientally with what is called
here a noddi, “O Bey !
: Shan't!” he muttered, sulkily.
“I didn't mean o-bey,” I ºned, courteously.
“Thought you did,” he growled. - -
So I began again. “O Bey—” but he interrupted me with a
e in his eye as he said,
“Get out wid you, you thief of the world. I’m not an Irishman.”
I was astonished at his familiarity with the mellifluous language
of Old Erin. He too was a little taken aback by my familiarity, but
we soon got over that when I had seized his idea of humour, and had
addressed him with—
“Bedad then, Misther O'BEY,” which tickled him immensely.
I then told him that being here for a quiet but serious chat—m
influence he knows would help him in certain quarters—we ºiá
have no “chaff” however “wheaty’ it might be (he roared at this,
and booked it-free of charge), and I would at once come to business.
First, then, I inquired in diplomatic Latin, “Quomodo sit vestra
* Mater "2"
He is a first-rate Latin scholar; and so am I, as you see.
“‘Mater’, is, a nuisance,” he replied, in rather free and easy
£º which I translate for your benefit, “and might as well be
a Mater-in-law.”
“Pas de blague,” said I, in the free-est and easiest French.

At this moment General BRfARD—“Bray-'ard” I called him, which
gave the Bey fits—with his staff, a thousand strong, was announced.
“You needn't go,” he said. “Conceal yourself behind the arras.”
I am not fond of playing Polonius, but to oblige the O'Bey I did
it. As I secreted myself, a sudden thought struck me. It was irre-
prºble, and I was obliged to whisper it into His Highness's ear.
“Bey,” I said, “O what a Dey we’re having !”
“Hush tº he returned, nearly choking in his endeavour to stifle
a roar of laughter. “I never saw such a fellow as you.”
“Yes,” I said, “I’m All-jeers in Tunis.”
I couldn't refrain from F. this jeu de mot by a dig intended
for his ribs, but, taking a bad anatomical shot, I caught him in what
they call here his “Bey-window,” and doubled him up.
As the step of the Frenchman was heard on the landing, the Bey,
recovering himself slightly, sighed aloud,
“Ah! he expects to return to France crowned with laurels.”
“Cheer up, grº: Bey-bey,” I ..º. as I disappeared behind
the drapery. “You won't be deposed: and he can't get his laurels
without the Bey leaves.”
Never saw a man chuckle so in all my life He was in fits; but
suddenly recalled to a sense of the situation by the clank of the
French General's spurs and sabre, he had the presence of mind to
turn two somersaults and come down on the divan, right end upper-
most, in a really dignified attitude.
What ſheard from behind the arras—an emb-arrasing position—
I cannot tell—at least, not on the usual terms.
Yours truly, GUs ARRAs.
PROVERBIAL ECONOMY.
THE increasing success of the scheme for receiving savings-bank
deposits in postage stamps, attests the sapience of the once if not still

ESSENCE OF
PARLIAMENT.
ExtraCTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
“SINK OR SWIM.”—CHAPLIN’s Teact.
House of Lords, Monday Night, May 16.--The Earl of GALLowAY
cannot make out what is the matter with noble Lords. The question
which the gallant Earl has brought before the House relates to pro-
P. alterations in the titles of Regiments of the Line and Militia.
rd GALLowAY has turned his mind largely upon the subject. He
has waded through Blue Books, and e voluminous extracts
therefrom. These he has brought down to the House, and has been
reading for the space of an hour. He is not a very good reader,
and, apart from its intrinsic iº. the subject is a little dry.
The ouse is not quite so fulſ as Lord GALLowAY had pictured to
himself when, in the recesses of Galloway House, Garliestown, he
commenced the composition of this remarkable work. So far from
being crowded, the benches are (not to put too fine a point upon it)
almost entirely tenantless. On the front bench sits Earl GRAN-
yILLE, looking as if a bad attack of the gout had suddenly returned.
On the bench below the orator sits his distinguished relative, the
Marquis of SALISBURY, who from time to time tosses about on the
seat as if there was scarce an inch of it free from protuberant pins.
On the cross-benches frets the illustrious warrior-Duke, who, as
Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, has something to say, on the
subject. H.R.H. fingers his notes angrily, and from time to time
turns upon the eloquent Earl of GALLowAY with a º: roval stare
calculated to make any other than the Colonel of the Royal Ayr and
Wigtown Militia sink into his boots.

Then Earl GRAN VILLE rises and blandly suggests that he is reading his
speech. H.R.H. looks at his watch, and finds he has just time to rush off and
dress for dinner. Other Members have gone before, and when Lord GALLowAY
at the end of two hours sits down triumphant, he finds he has argued all but five
Peers clean out of the building.
L ##" done in Commons.—Resumed Debate on Second Reading of Irish
and Blll.
House of Commons, Tuesday Night.-Mr. BALFour, who hath as E. a
wit as his uncle and is less explosive in its flashing forth, professed to be much
affected to-night by the divergence between those two eminent men, Mr. DILWYN
and Mr. RYLANDs. Reminded him, he said, of the parting between Fox and
BURRE. It was truly touching, and should have drawn a larger circle of
spectators. PETER's judicial air, his desire not to wound the susceptibilities of
his hon, friend below him, and his patronage of the Government were, as they
say, quite too too.
Not a bad joke that of Mr. BALFouB. PETER, in the ecstasy of his enjoyment
of his own banter bent low over the head of Mr. DILwyn who sat on the bench
beneath, and discussed what he called “his psychological development.”
“. Rather thought,” said Mr. BALFour, “he was making examination of his
phrenological development,” Quite cheering to hear Mr. BEREsford HoPE
explode with laughter.
Mr. BALFour missed another rupture between friendly powers even more
striking than the break between PETER and Mr. DILwyN. To-night an alliance
of long standing has been broken by what looks like an act of perfidy. RAN-
Dolph had a Motion on the paper which might come on at some late hour.
RANDOLPH has a fine sense of a due division of duty on Tuesday nights. Goes
off to dine, and saunters through the gilded saloonstill º ; then returns,
expecting House to be sitting, and opportunity given him for a few remarks.
Duty of Government to see #. kept on º GLADstone should be in
his place, or BRIGHT, or, at least, HARcourt, or perhaps HARTINGTON. Firmly
believing that after what he had said about last Tuesday the offence would not
be repeated, RANDoIPH went off to spend the evening. Mr. BIGGAR, observing
the absence of his ally, determined to count out the House. Pretty to see Joey
B. gliding in and out, standing at the Bar counting Members. Looked in at
half-past seven. No chance. At eight; more promising. Mr. FAY tried to
forestall him; moved a Count, and defeated. Joey B. ºvºi. sly) waits till
SPEAKER goes out and House empties. Moment SPEARER takes the Chair,
before Members are back, J. B. moves Count. Only twenty-five can get back
in time. House up.
Joseph G.ILLIS, walking with long strides across Palace Yard, softly smilin
to himself as he thinks of what RANDolph will say when he comes down an
finds the House up, was a sight worth living for.
Business done.—None.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Most deliriously exciting afternoon. Scotch Educa:
tion Bill. Dr. CAMERON moved Second Reading in a speech only an hour and
a half long. . Full of sparkle and subtle humour set off with natural eloquence
and appropriate gesture. Then Sir Edward ColeBR00K poured forth a flood
of soul-stirring speech. , Sir STAFFORD NonTHcore was in his place whilst Sir
Edward's melodious voice filled the Chamber. He feigned sleep, but his lips
moved, and those near him might have heard him mutter,

“Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
Whilst thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad

Thursday.—Debate on Second Reading Irish Land
Bill finished at last. Mr. CHAPLIN, up to-night, and
up for nearly two hours. Beautiful speech. Full of
the loveliest, longest, and most alliterative assortment
of adjectives. Then 'Mr. STANSFELD, not nearly so loud,
but equally well satisfied with himself... Sly man, Mr
STANsfELD. Wants to #. women into Parliament, and
by way of making the House used tº the notion, wears
his hair long, parts it down the middle, and makes long
speeches in a mincing manner understood by the
bachelors of the House to be peculiar to women when
arguing. Best speech of the Debate made by Lord
Richard GRosy ENoB after the Division on Lord ELCHO's
Amendment. “Ayes to the right of them, 352; Noes to
Wednesday Afternoon—the Scotch have
their
the left of them, 176.” This means that the Second
ing is passed by a majority of two to one.
Friday Night.—The two new Members for Knares-
borough, Mr. ToM Collins and his Umbrella, arrived

other came to take his Seat

DUKES AND DIRT.
MUCK begets muck, and carters and market-gardeners
accustomed for years to the filth and overcrowding of
Mud-Salad Market, can hardly be blamed if their natures
are subdued to what they work in. If they bring, the
food of London to market in the same carts in which
they carry manure back to the country; if they {".
fully upset this manure down the areas of the Duke of
MUDFord's unfortunate tenants; if they injure the far
too costly vegetables with encrusted filth, and do all they
can to poison the blood of buyers and sellers, they are
only acting according to their lights; they have never
been taught anything better. Parochial fussiness and
sanitary activity are paralysed in the presence of a great
Duke, and the blotches of mud upon his escutcheon
are regarded as marks of honour.
Our friend, and fellow-worker, the Lancet, wonders
that any people out of Bedlam can be responsible for the
scheme of bringing a new Hospital within this centre of
noise and muck; and we also wonder that a space having
been once cleared is not dedicated, at any cost, to an
extension of the Market. The Parisians have a place
which is a credit to their city, and which they call the
“Market of the innoºnts.” Our Mud-Salad ducal slice
of London is not one-sixth the size of theirs, though our
Innocents are more than three times as numerous.. Our
Innocents in this case—we might almost call them Idiots
—are the population of London.

That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation

Alderman. I see, JoHN JONES, you are summoned for not sending

John Jones. I have to say, Sir, that I don’t send him to school
because I prefer to teach him myself at home.
Alderman. And so you set yourself above the lor?
School-Board Officer. Your Worship, the Act says the boy shall
attend an efficient school.
Alderman. And he goes to no school at all?
John Jones. No, Sir, and I will tell you the reason why.
Alderman. Reason! There can't be any reason in the case. You
set yourself above the lor. You think yourself wiser than Queen,
Lords, and Commons all of an 'eap. An' I am sorry to say there are,
now-a-days, a good many folks of your way o' thinkin'. But they

School-Board Officer. I have had a great deal of trouble about
this case, Sir.
Alderman. No doubt; no doubt; but I am T. willing to 'ear
what the gent 'as got to say. I am 'ere, am 1 not, to administer
justice between man and man, and between man and woman too, and
even between woman and woman, which is the 'ardest work of all.
John Jones. All I have to say, Sir, is that instead of sending my
boy to a Board School, I prefer teaching him at home. . He is, as you
may see, a delicate boy, and not a very clever boy, and I know from
my own experience, for I have been a teacher myself, that such boys
at a public school are apt to be neglected by the masters, and bullied
by the other boys. When he is a year or two older, he may be better
able to rough it. But at present, with all deference to you, Sir, I
think he is much better at home.
School-Board Officer. He has passed no standard at all, Sir.
John Jones. How could he, when he has never been tried? I wish
. yourself, Sir, would put some questions to him; not too hard, for
e is only seven.
Alderman. Very well, let the boy stand forward. (Boy comes
forward in front of the Alderman, looking rather frightened.). Let

Alderman. No, no, this is wasting the time of the Court. I’ave
'eard all you’ave to say, and you must be fined to the full amount
with costs.
John Jones. Well, Sir, I will pay the fine rather than have my
furniture sold by the School-Board. But before Fº the money,
I would respectfully ask under what section of the Act I am to
be fined for not sending my boy to school, when, my neighbour in
the next street, who happens to pay more rent than I do, is never
troubled by the School-Board at all, and may either educate his
children at home, or not educate them at all, as it may please his
fancy. I much fear, Mr. Alderman, that in this country, as in all
other countries, there is one law for the rich and another for the poor.

you are 1. Capital idea of GLADSTONE to give spirit licences to rail-

of ginger-beer. Got ticket for Battersea Park.
Berne Hill.—Hallo! Never expected to come here / Fact is,
crowd of people round the Refreshment Bar confused me. I must
have missed getting out at the right moment. Ginger-beer very
nice. Think I was right to correct the acidity in the usual manner.
Still very thirsty. ink I shall just have time to get somethi
say a little lemonade—before we start. Hallo! we are off! Wonder
where this train is going to ? Hope to Battersea Park.
Horsham.—Don’t know how I got here ! Fact is, fancy I must
have been to sleep after that pint of champagne. Horsham seems a
nice sort of place. . Rather a headache. Happy Thought.—Bottle
of soda-water, and then get out...Find my ticket. All right!
“First-class to Battersea Park.” Why—here ! I say! Stop! We
are off #º. Thought.—Brandy in soda-water: take off chill.

to come, but suppose I forgot to get out at any of the intermediate

GROUNDS FOR COMPLAINT.
MY DEAR PUNCH, -
A. YEAR ago I purchased a yacht and joined a
Yachting Club. My object was simply unalloyed
enjoyment. This past week I received a letter bear-
ing the crest of my Club. A dinner, I thought, or a
cheery cruise, and I opened the missive with consi-
derable glee. The letter was to the effect that, as
...the Sailing Committee recommended the formula
*i;" as a rule of measurement, a general
meeting of the Club was to be held to discuss it.”
What the above means, I am proud to say I have
not the remotest idea, but I wish you would take
the matter in hand, and expose it. If life is to be rendered a
burden by algebraical questions, I shall give up yachting and go
into the Church.
Yours truly,
Yacht “Squeaker” off Gravesend.

“Schoolboys,” remarks a dear old-womanly contemporary, “are
not what they were. . They drink, champagne where ginger-beer
once sufficed, and scholarship is a thing of the past.”. If this be so,

; into an equivocal profession, the same as if he were going on the Stock
xchange or going to keep a pawnbroker's shop.”—Sir WILFRID LAwson at

SIR WILFRID, it seems, most insultingly jeers
At the Army, which well may disdain his wild sneers;
Or the soldier, indignant, might answer full soon
That his calling beats that of a witless buffoon.
NEW NAUGHTYCAL MUSIC.
WE notice that Mr. J. L. MQLLoy has produced a new song called
The Boatswain's Story. Glad to hear it, and still
more glad to hear that J. L. M., for whose music we
have a sincere regard, is continuing the series with
The Mate's Whopper; The Swab's Suppression ºf
Fact, The Cabin- ov's Crammer, The Lie of the
Land-Lubber. The Second Lieutenant's Abominable
Falsehood, The Corswain of the Captain's Gig's
Disgusting Perversion of the Truth, and The Mate's
Mendacity.
Will any of these be ready for Mr. SANTIEy's
Concert on “the º before the battle, Mother," i.e.
the 31st, or eve of the Derby. Good subject for a
Lady's song, “ The Eve of the Derby.” . Music by ADAM. -
SULLIVAN is writing The Boz-and-Corswain.
FLUKE FOR THE FARMERS,
THE last number of the Journal of the Royal Society of England
reports an investigation of the recent losses by fluke in sheep. Evi-
. i No, not for mutton, and as for beef-ºwell,—good beef needs
Ilo Ousil.
BILL AND WILL-Allowance is made in the Irish Land Bill fºr the

Ireland, however, is priceless. Lucky the Landlord who possesses it.

is to be hoped that the gentle

With her universal talents, she

Miss FANNY º: I-

the appalling future of Communism, anarchy, and revolution, that,
according to the late learned ATToRNEY-GENERAL, waits this country
shortly after the passing of the Irish Land Bill, may find the fol-
lowing advance paper of questions of considerable use:-
1. Give the name of the last LoRD MAYor who was guillotined
privately, and had his head put, at his own request, on a pole at the
top of the Temple Bar Memorial.
2. Who were the seventeen Bishops and Archbishops who were
flung together into a tank at the Aquarium, and rescued, after some
difficulty, by Miss BeckwitH and the Assistant-Manager ? And
was this outrage repeated twice on Saturday?
3. The following are the seven post-Jacobin Emperors:–BRAD-
LAUGH, CHURCHILL, GossET THE FIRST, GossET THE Second, GossET
THE , MARwood, BARRY SULLIvan. Give some account of
the foreign pºlicy of each, and sayin whose reigns were introduced,
respectively, the compulsory." Wearing of Chain-Armour, on Sun-
days,” “Trial by Torture,” “County-Court Hanging,” and “Shak-
spearian Readings to Convicts.”
4. Describe the falling of the Duke of York's Column by order of
the Convention. How many years was it allowed to lie in the
smoking-room of the Athenæum ? - -
. 5. Analyse the following passage, and mention what similar crisis
in Roman history it recalls:–
“Then came the great day of action. The train was fired. Before
upon the Houses of Parliament, St. Paul's, the Abbey, Somerset
House, all the Government Offices, and five-and-twenty public
buildings had been shot up simultaneously into the air in a thunder
of exploding dynamite. Public feeling was somewhat appeased, but
at a little before three it was hinted that the National Anthem had
been sung by some one at the Beefsteak Club. The place was sur-
rounded. Only the Secretary and the Steward were on the premises,
but they were taken to the Tower. They made their escape that
night to North Woolwich Gardens. But King William Street was
doomed. At a .. past eight the whole neighbourhood was sud-
denly left a smoki f ruin. It happened that the Folly Theatre had
not long commenced its performance. The audience were dissatisfied.
The temper of the times, however, was not one of compromise. Mr.
Toole refused to return them their money. The effect of this an-
nouncement was electric. The next morning three millions of people
assembled at Charing Cross and thanked him publicly for “nothaving
despaired of the Republic.’”
6. Give the now historic words in which Mr. LABouchere, on
having the Dictatorship, together with the Mace, Crown jewels, half
the contents of the Bank of England, and theº of a public
funeral pressed upon him by a deputation, showed them the door and
referred them curtly to his solicitors.
7. Give some account of the last days of the House of Peers
at Fiji.
And (8) describe the gradual *::: of the decline and fall of the
British Empire, commencing with the passing of the Irish Land Bill,
and culminating in the opening of the Isle of Dogs on Sunday.
The Salle Volatile.
I should like to see the two great SARAHs together in some English
piece,” said an orchestra-stall-wart }. man at the Gaiety.
-- at two SARAHs?” asked his ..i.
“Why, SAL BERNHARDT and SAL-WINI. They’re both coming,
aren't they?”

WERSES FOR WEGETARIANS.
[The Members of the Wegetarian Society met on May 18th in conference.
It was reported that the Society had twelve restaurants, in one of which
700 persons dined daily; the aggregate being 3000 diners every day.]
BRING hither the leek, for its flavour is dear,
With cabbage that always provides us good cheer;
Let onions be cooked, and dº artichoke too,
hile rosy tomatoes loom fair on our view;
And give me the water-cress fresh from the bed,
With beetroot that blushes a beautiful red.
The spinach looks well with some eggs on the dish :
There's ºi. which gourmets serve up with salt fish:
The sea-kale and brocoli merit our praise,
With tender . cut in spring days:
Both carrots and turnips are toothsome, and still
The cucumber woos us to eat 'gainst our will.
There’s parsley, which serves as a garnish; and dry
Your lettuce and endive ere salads you try;
The pea has its merits, and everyone leans
To one merry meal off a dish of broad beans:
With celery, rhubarb, and pears, and the rest,
The gay Wegetarian lives on the best'

THE Chancellor's Medal, at Cambridge, due to the best English
verses written by an Undergraduate, has been adjudged to Mr.
ARTHUR REED RoPEs, Scholar of King's, for a poem composed on
the subject of “Temple Bar.” The LoRD MAYor, and Aldermen, in

In Memoriam, should constitute Mr. RoPEs (with an adequate
official salary) Poetiaureate to the City of London, N.B.-This is
suggested by “One who knows the Ropes.”
PAY AND PLAY.
THE Times gives us these interesting particulars about the Théâtre
Français:—
“The º to authors during the past five years averaged annuall
more than 200,000f. (£8,000). Two years ago Hernani was reproduced º
such success that the author's royalty for three months amounted to 50,000f.
(£2,000).” .
Bravo Victor Hugo L’homme qui rit! But this is the system
for success and for the encouragement of original and carefully
constructed plays. No matter what the author's standing, he must
receive his per-centage on the receipts, after a certain nightly
deduction for charity. - - -
The French Dramatic Authors' Society can enforce its rights as a
legally authorised body on behalf of the very weakest of its members.
With such results French Authors can afford to bestow more time
and care on their work than most of their English confrères can give.

“HEjests at Czars who never felt a wound” inflicted by Nihilists.
General IGNATIEFF should be written General IGNITEIFF, as pro-
bably there is no one more capable of re-lighting the smouldering

Siberia a cure for every evil.
SARCEY CRITICISM.
M. FRANCISquE SARCEY, the bumptious dramatic critic, lately
received a challenge for speaking disrespectfully of M. GoT, the actor,
but avoided fighting by giving an explanation, which, t y
amounted to, “I’ve not been Sarcey, and I won't Go out.”

MORE EASILY SAID THAN DONE.
“CoME AND sit on GRANDMAMMA's LAP, DARLING !”
ME AND THE MISSIS
ox ENTERTAINMENTS For THE PEOPLE.
I Dov't like bein’ labelled ! If I was luggage or a doctor's shop it might
come materal, but I ain't and it don't. . Therefore entertainments or what not
ticketed “for the People” don't pertikler fetch me, not as a rule they don't.
Who are the People; or, if it comes to that, who aren't they If the party–
barring Queen Victoria of course—who thinks he doesn't belong to the People'll
kindly step out and say so straight, I’m good for a word or two with him. If I
went for a walk in my Sunday best I shouldn't care, to have a bill at my back
with “This is a º, ” on it. . Similarly when clergymen or caterers
adwertise their little affair as bein’ “for the People,” I’m mostly inclined to
say, “You’re another,”-and stop away. ... .
But we do give 'em a turn—Me and the Missis-now and agen, and a good deal
amused we are, sometimes, thºugh prºps not percisely in the way we’re expected
to be. “Expected to be,” ah! that's where they make the mistake. People,
with a big or a little “p,” can't be amused by simply being told to be. “Amuse
and instruct” us, is what they want to do. All serene. ... I've no objection.
Only dull goodygoody won't do it, for one thing, nor yet what I shall wenture
to call rum-faddiness. Likeways we don't care to have it poured into us with a
spoon, like physic, nor yet spelt out to us in synnables, like the big words in a
young !... Me and the Missis went one Sunday afternoon not long ago
to an exhibition of what I should describe as Artistic oddgomeshorts out White-
chapel way. Pictures, old china, tapestry, and what the Missis calls jigamarees
in general. High Art they said it was, high Art for the People, and a high old
joke the people seemed to find it., Fogged silence and faces as long as from
ere to yonder was the order of the day. Praps that's the nateral result of
high Art; if so she'll have to come down a trifle before she elewates me worth
mentioning. - - -- - -
Somebody—a rayther topsawyerish schoºlbºy I should nail it—had pinned
written “explanations” in the Mavor's Spellin'-book style, on to all the pictures
an cetrer. e pictures fogged me, but the explanations riled me. All my
narsty temper, the Missis said. Praps. Only the drop-it-dºwn-uice-and-easy:
to-'em style o' thing does put my back up, somehow. “What's the objeck of all
this here, John º' - -
speak out loud. “To bring Beauty home to the workin'-classes,” says I. “Oh!
and is that Beauty P" says she, pointing to a lady with a long chin and a bad
says the Missis in a whisper, nobody seemed to like to M
attack of the internal spazzums, who seemed to have §:
herself mixed up with a laurel bush and some miscella-
neous laundry. “Spose so,” says I. Then says the Missis,
“I’ll take it kindly if she'll stop away, for she makes
me feel as miserable as she looks.” "Ah! got a joronto
her, ain't she?” *g. a greasy lookin' chap as overheard
us. “Turn the Sunday milk sour, I should say.”
Beauty didn't seem to come home to him, somehow.
Taking tother extreme, Me and the Missis went latel
for an evening at the Victoria Coffee Music Hall, º
is the disreputable but jolly old Vic turned teatotal and
—well thundering dull, I say, and chance it. I’m not
so set on tipple myself, that I can't take my amusement
without it. Only it's got to be amusement. At the
W. C. M. H. it wasn't, not to Me and the Missis at least.
“Here you are,” says I, pointing to a seat. “Oh, John,”
says she, “do let's take a form where somebody else is
sittin’.” You see two in the Stalls, and about twenty
in the Pit want a lot of keerful distrybution to make
things snug and cosy all round.
The entertainment was third-rate Music Hall, and dull
at that; and when the applause came, which wasn’t
often, it sounded as weak as a whisper on Salisbury Plain,
and as ashamed of itself as a snore in sermon time. A
quotation from SHAKSPEARE on the programme said that
music was good for “doleful dumps.” Not that of “a
refined serio-comic” with a cheep-cheep-chuckabout sort
of a voice, nor yet that of a “baritone vocalist” like a
broken-down waiter with a cold in his head. Leastways
Me and the Missis didn't find it so. So we thought we’d
try what seedy cake and Sparkling Rubine would do.
“Always as lively as this, Miss?” says I to the attend-
ant at the bar, when a boy in a red blouse like a boot-
black had woke her up with the 'eavy end of a water-
bettle. “No,” says she, buſing for a corkscrew, “this
is about as ba—a-a-a-" didn't quite see how
many synnables that yawn was agoin to run to, so I
turns it up sharp and asks no more questions.
Nodoubt they mean well, both “nobs” and the “coffee
ts,” but they haven’t quite got the hang of it. I
ear there's some talk now of starting what they call
“At Homes” for the People. Whatever that may mean,
what they’ve got to do first is to make the people feel
at home. Long-chin'd Beauty and lackadaisycalness
won't do it, nor yet dead-alive dulness and Gingerette.
Straight!
“THE MILLING EXHIBITION.”
This instructive ex-
hibition, we regret to
says clo last week.
Millers came from aii
parts of the Fº
and from the nti-
nent. The accompany-
ing drawing represents
two of the Prize-Millers.
We hope the Show will
be repeated; or, if not
- recisely the same, at
least an entertainment of a si-mº character.
FINISHED AT LAST.
THE Revisionary Committee of the 0. & N. T. have
finished their work, and a new version of the Liber
Librorum was presented to the Archbishop of CANTER-
BURY in Convocation last week. On all hands the result
seems to be pronounced a very qualified success, if not
an absolute failure. It was at §§ more avisionary than
a re-visionary undertaking. In no irreverent spirit, but
as a matter of philological interest, we should very much
like to know what were the suggestions for improvement
made by our American cousins? If they at all corre-
sponded to the English popular idea of Americanisms we
do not wonder at their rejection. We leave it to our
readers to conjecture—we should say to guess—what the
Transatlantic notions might have been like.
A Colour ABLE CoxcEIT.-Poets have described the

the occupation of Tunis will convert the “dark blue
sea’’ into a French lake.

The day was a glorious one—not too cold nor yet too
warm. Now would the sun emerge from the clouds and
flood all nature with a perfect bath of glory. Now the rain
Yº...". in torrents. Now the snow would fall lightly
upon thousands of ulsters and sealskins. And yet these
changes were so brightly blended that there were some who
did not see the sunshine, some who did not feel the rain,
some who did not notice the snow!
Hºw to get to Epsom was the first thought of many a
Londoner on that ever-memorable Wednesday. Those who
liked leisurely progress went by road—those who preferred
speed betook themselves to the Kaº, Station.
It has been reported that many had to wait at the booking-
office at Waterloo Station several seconds before they could
secure a ticket. It has been also rumoured that, on more than
one occasion, the vehicles on the road had to walk slowly, on
account of the crowded appearance of the thoroughfare.
The incidents on the way down having been now fully
and exhaustively described, the aspect of the Course and its
surroundings º attention. Something not unlike the
scene witnessed on Wednesday June the First had been gazed
upon before. This may appear a bold assertion when it is
remembered how unlike one Derby-Day is to another, and
yet such indeed was the fact. or instance, there were
several persons on the Grand Stand, and the Hill could not
be justly described as deserted. Here and there luncheon
was eaten on the top of a drag, and amongst the crowd were
recognised, now and again, a perambulating Ethiopian sere-
nader. Those who listened attentively, too, could hear dis-
tinctly the sound of voices.
But as it may be objected that the above remarks are almost
of a too general character, it may be as well to enter into
particulars. Nothing could have been more interesting than
the group collected on the Epsom Downs on Wednesday the
First of June. All the celebrities of the day, deserting the
Grand Stand and the drags, paraded by mutual consent on a
secluded portion of the #h. Wishing as much as possible
to fall in with the desires of Sir WILFRID Lawson, they
determined to treat the great race of the year with sovereign
contempt. Thus, when the finish was over as follows:-
l, The Winner; 2. The Derby Dog: 3, Policeman X; and
the remainder of the field nowhere, the most illustrious of
our Lords and Gentlemen were disporting themselves with
their backs turned to the Course in the most delightful man-
mer. It was at this the
supreme moment that. Mr.
GLADstone engaged in a
friendly contest with Sir
STAFFord Northcote in
the excitin game of
- ºãº The
Conservative Leader was º by Sir John Astley and
Mr. W. H. SMITH, while Mr. John Barght bravely took
odds about “the Striker.” Mr. CHAPLIN, forgetting all
º animosities, generously officiated as stake-
older. It was at this moment too that Lord SALIs Buky,
seeing Sir STAfroRn engaged “in another place,” stealthily
invited a gipsy to tell him his fortune in his character of “a
pºtty gentleman”—the Duke of Richmond, surnamed the
*Disappointed,” regarding the group thus formed with
a feeling that it would take volumes to adequately ex-
press. . Then Sir WILLIAM HARcourt, always knowing
more about everything than anyone else, discovered the King
in the celebrated Card Trick to the admiration of all beholders.
Following the lead of H.R.H.. the Prince of WALEs and
Lord ALPRED PAGET, Lords CARRINGTon and Rose BERY
determined to have nothing to do with the race, and walked
away from the Downs as the horses passed the winning-post.
Sosplendid an act of self-denial was so f. appreciated by
Sir WILFR1D Lawson, that the teetotal Baronet immediately
celebrated the event in a foaming glass of Zoedone, to the
languidastonishment of Mrs. WHEELER, Miss ELLEN TERRY,
and Mrs. LANGTRY, who evidently mistook the unvinous
but cheering beverage for genuine champagne. Then Mr.
IRVING glanced at the race to see if he could obtain from it
fresh inspiration for the character of Othello; while CETE-
wayo made a noted AEsthete perfectly Wylde. Such was
the scene on the Hill, which might have been witnessed by
anyone—knowing where to find it!
ut, after all, the Derby was the event of Wednesday the
First of June. It cannot but be felt that no account of this
remarkable twenty-four hours would be complete without
some report of the running.
Several of the horses º: in the Paddock—may, all
except those that were sa #. at the starting-post. As the
papers have published a full list of the probable starters and
ockeys, it would be a waste of time, if not an evidence of
ad taste, to give the names of those that actually put in an
appearance. Such a catalogue would beinvidious in the last
degree, and might lead to a great deal of disappointment.
Suffice it to say that all the horses that were intended to run
were brought before the starter several minutes before he
lowered ag.
And here it would be well to stop, were it not that in an
ante-dated report it is more than usually interesting to spot
the winner. , Well, then, they are off! They pass Tatten-
ham Corner! It is all over, and the race has been run in
more than a minute, and less than half an hour. There has
been a First, a Second, and a Third The name of the First
is the most important—and see, there is the Number on the
Board. Refer to your card, and all—yes, all—is revealed
to you!

witty things, has a little conundrum on this matter of the douceur
of Sir FREDERICK ROBERTs:—“What is the difference between
RANDoI.PH's authority and RANDoIPH himself?” “One is Vanity
Fair and the other Unfair Vanity.”
The Soda-and-Brandy was, regarded seriously, a somewhat sad
affair. Lord HARTINGTON is voung and strong, and if he thinks it
worth while to catch and crush a moth, the effort gives him no
trouble. But for RANDoLPH, after spending an agreeable evening
in the service of his country else-
where, to come in at two o'clock
in the morning, and begin to
bait GLADstone, who had been
already sitting, with brief inter-
mission, for nine hours, strenu-
ously wrestling with the Com-
mittee in moulding his Budget
scheme—for RANDoIPH to do
this, suggests reflections which
perhaps it would not be polite
to reflect.
Business done.—Budget Bill
considered in Committee.
Tuesday.—Heard somewhere
of “the good man struggling
with adversity.” Saw him this
afternoon standing at the Table
with legs and arms contorting
in fearful fashion. Adversity

not perhaps the most passionately beloved man in the House. A
trifle too self-assertive and self-satisfied. At first House not insen-
sible to certain enjoyment in seeing him wrestling with the Irish
Members. He undertook the post of Chief Secretary with so mani-
festly light a heart, and with such cheery determination, to show
Great Britain and Ireland how the thing was to be done. Also some
secret chuckling at the spectacle of Mr. BIGGAR, with his thumb
in the arm-hole of his waistcºat, calmly advising Mr. FoESTER to
retire from a post for which he is “notor’usly unfit.” -
Things are past a joke now. The sympathy of the House entirely
with Mr. FonstER, as he makes an i. stand against the
violent vituperation and unmannerly attacks made upon him night
after night. They do him no harm in the estimation of those who
hear j see. There may or may not be something in the case which
Irish Members desire to present. What is certain is it will never be
listened to from the men who assume to represent Ireland under the
leadership of Mr. PARNELL. They have so often shown themselves
incapable of distinguishing between fact and fancy, truth and

deliberate lying, that men with other business to attend to cannot
spare time to listen on the chance of hº a few facts.
All very well this, and very true; But hard for Mr. FoESTER to
take this philosophical, view, and to, sit unmoved whilst Mr.
O'Donnel.L. slowly gimlets, him, and Mr. HEALY, lying in wait
behind a corner, heaves half a,brick at him, and then runs off to
shelter himself behind “Privilege.”..To-day he has it out with
them. He trembles in every limb with honest indignation, whilst
the Irish Members sit and watch him as the audience in a theatre sit
and watch the champion dancer who gyrates for their amusement.
The Chief Secretary's will may be law at the Castle; but there is
sweet revenge to be taken at Westminster.
Business done.—Mr. FoESTER baited by Irish Members.
Wednesday.—With twenty minutes to six comes Mr. BIGGAR. He
has not been in the House throughout the Sitting, and business has
one on without distraction. The unfortunate Members who have
ills on the Orders which they might § advanced by a stage, know
very well what he means. If they didn't, they would soon learn.
As soon as a quarter to six strikes and Debate stopped, SPEAKER
rises and proposes to go through the Orders. Reads out title of Bill.
“I object,” says Mr. BiggaR. Another Bill and another objection,
sometimes shared with Mr. WARTON, with occasional stra }. for
Mr. HEALY. But the guiding spirit is Joseph GILLIS, by the side of
whom Mr. WARTON becomes monotonous and common-place. Many
efforts made from time to time to inveigle J. B. from the precincts of
the House at this hour. All failures. Joseph's eagle eye flashes
through the strategy, and calmly he advances to a seat above the
Gangway, placing himself directly under the SPEAKER's left ear-
“just as if he were the knot in the rope,” says Alderman Fowl.ER,
who in his time has been a Sheriff.
Business done.—Nothing particular.
Thursday.—Great and graceful entry by Mr. ECROYD
for Preston. The whole business dramatically arranged.
introduced by Law and
Order: Law, Sir John
Holkeh; Order, Colonel
STANLEY. Sir JoBN ad-
vances towards the table
with all the º º
that is part of his Par-
liamentary manner. Poli-
tics have always been quite
too-too for honest JACK.
If they would only let him
run amuck at the *...;
Parliamentary life might
be endurable. But what
with talk about expedi-
ency and references to re-
sponsibility, JACK thinks
arliamentary life scarce
worth living. Sometimes
comes down after dinner,
and if no one on the front
bench, has a little dashin,
taking care to clear out before NoFTHCOTE or any of them cºme
down with their "What’s this?” their “Dear me!” and their
“Now, really, don't you think, Hol{ER: ” Sir John got rid of his
charge as if it were a badly-backed brief, sheering off when he had
come near enough to point out the Mace to the new-comer. Then
strolling off with the ſook of half-sleepy, wholly ineffable weariness
that is so touching. - -
Mr. Ecroyd simply delightful, Tories cheered like mad, Alder;
man Fowzen kept it up till his face looked like “the purple-headed
mountain” of which the poet, sings. Mr. ECRoyD accepted atten:
tions with due measure of dignity and satisfaction. *::::: with
light and graceful step he impartially turned his head, to rig t and
ift, changing the expression of his face with great skill. He had
“A tear for those who love him,
A smile for those who hate.”
Impossible to say which was better done, the smile that he turned
towards the silent Łº. or the º expression of unalterable
regard and friendly protection which he bestowed upon the elated
Conservatives. -
Business done,—House got into Committee on the Land Bill.
Friday Night.—This Government not going to be beaten by the
last in anything. STAFFord Northcote made a great hit with his
Confidence Trick. GLADSTONE determined to show that he is an
equal adept in juggling:
Selected the HatTrick for the performance. In some respects not
quite so striking as the Confidence Trick, which required the audi-
ence to produce Six Millions out of their own pockets and hand it to
the conjuror. Mr. GLADstone wanted nobody's money. The only
article he desired to borrow was a hat, and this was obligingly
furnished , by the SoLICITOR - GENERAL. Performance 90m-
menced at six o'clock precisely. House crowded ; pit ;
boxes bursting ; strangers turned away in hundreds from the
Gallery; The PREMIER got up and stood before the table hol
out his hand to show that there was no deception. People rºar
with applause, and demanded an encore. PREMIER again rose, hold-
ing out his hand as before, again demonstrating that there was nº
deception, Now there were cries of “Hat I Hat!” GLADSTONE sat
down again. SoLIcitoR-GENERAL handed up his hat, PREMIER putit
on his head, or rather on half his head, for it would not go on farther,
|and then dexterously balancing it as another conjuror might balances

I HAVE bin offered a werry liberal engagement for Epsom nex
Wensday, but I don't think I shall except it. .
It's all werry well for your young swells with more money than
branes, and more sperrits than they can carry soberly and strait, but
for respekable people, like lºft who go in for respekability
afore everythink, it’s a awful low plaice. Most of the men seems to
try and look as low and as . and as blaggardy as they can, and
many on 'em succeeds admirubbly; and as for the Ladies, no doubt
they’re as bootiful as Howeries, as I thinks the Turkeys calls 'em,
but their conduck is that free and easy, as is rayther astonishing
to a respekable father of seven.
I’ve seen all the fun of the Farel I’ve lost my money at
Thimbel Rig, which still remanes to me one of the Missterrys of
Life. I was once injuiced to put on the Gloves with the Tipton
Slasher, outside his Booth, and acshally had the honor of hitting
on the nose, and then of being knoct down as flat as a pancake
and then asked ifi should like any more, and all for the sm

I even remember wunce having quite a frendly nod from the

in quite a confedenshal moment, that there was one certain way, an
only one way, of spotting the Darby winner. - -

I’ve druv down with my old Gai in a one horse Shay, but that was
in my Greens and Sallad days, when I lived with my Father the

speshally when we had to get down and ease our nice little oss by
pushing behind up the ills.
Ah, them's jolly times when one's young, and harty, and isn't

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARL
A DERBY DREAM.
SIR,-A friend of mine knew
a Man whose Wife's Aunt once
dreamt that a convict had carried
off all the }* from Knowsley.
The mert day West Australian
won the Derby." Of course had
the lady but followed the dictates
of Fate, she would have netted
an ENormous fortune. But, such
is human perversity, she did not.
Now, Sir, strange to say, on Satur-
day º (I believe about
2:30 P.M.) after having consumed
a most modest supper of dressed
crab and champagne, I also dreamt
a dream, which I am certain is
nothing more nor less than a
certain tip for the great event.
I distinctly saw a king waving a
red flag, attached to a battle-axe,
to an Arab in a Scotch cap. That
vision has been a source of drink
and desolation to me, for I am
neither Joseph nor CAGLIosTRo.
My business is neglected, my wife
and children cannot persuade me
to eat. I have learnt Mother
Shipton's prophecy º heart, and
yet I am unable to solve the mys-
tery. In the faint hope that some
one of your readers may be more
fortunate, I am, Sir,
Yours despondently,
A GoRE Coox.
A Site—to be Taken.
THE place said to have been se-
lected by Prince CHRISTIAN for a
house is called The Mount Hanger
Hill. But what a ready-made
and appropriate name for the resi-
dence of Sir FREDERICKLEIGHTox,
President of the Royal Academy.
The Mount for a picture; and
then Hanger Hill—it's perfect.
_
FIZZIOLOGICAL FACTS.
THE plea put forward by the accused in a recent libel case, that
he had been driven to the commission of the offence by an excessive
resºrt to Zoedone, suggests an entirely new departure in connection
with “temperance” and other aerated beverages. Crime has not
hitherto been directly associated with soda-water, but if it is to be
so, then let us take * sample 2f the Fiction of the Future :-
The Duke whimpered on the hearth-rug, and once more tried to
sharpen the carving-knife on his boots. He had taken the pledge.
But still he sharpened that terrible knife!
"I can't do it, CHESTERTON,” he said, swallowing a tumbler of
Wilhelmsquelle as he spoke-" I can't do it. When I think of her
pretty yellow little neck, reposing in sweet unsuspicion on the blue
satin above, I feel I can't do it.”
Conscience awoke as with a convulsive wrestle. The Butler saw it,
and $neered; then he paled a little, and approached the cellaret.
''. Knows your Grace of no friend able to nerve his arm, when—”
“Stay!” thundered the Peer, recalling an orgy with Friedrichs-
hall, and now livid with rising resolution, “and bring it me. I
will have a whole one.”
He held out an empty celery-glass as he spoke. The Butler had
been drinking º of Hunyadi János, and there was an awful
glitter in his eye; He poured, the hissing contents of a huge bottle
into the extended vase. Quick as lightning the Duke gulped down
its terrible contents, and, with one last flash of his carving-knife,
leapt up the marble stairs—a raving Teetotaller
here was a ghastly struggle for one hour and fifty minutes.
Then a cry-and then the opening of another bottle / And after that
there was silence. The awful work had been done only too well!
Hºyen help the Duchess! The Duke had had twº Magnums of
Apollinari: !. -
And so on. What does Sir WILFRID say to it? Local Option can
not last for ever.
PUNCH*S FANCY PORTRAITS.–No. 34.
OUR “ROSEBERY PLATE.”
MORE STATIONERY.
THE House of Lords has asked
for a return of the exits from
the London Theatres, and the
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN has collected
this return and presented it. The
LoRD CHAMBERLAIN does not say
a word to the Legislature about a
clumsy and restrictive Act of
Parliament under which the
Gaiety, Criterion, Britannia, and
many other theatres are deprived
of their most valuable exits, be-
cause they are not allowed to
communicate with premises
as licensed public-houses. The
Managers are supposed to be re-
sponsible for exits that are not
unbolted, but they can hardly be
responsible for exits that are
bricked up by legislative folly.
Sum Good from It.
To the Amateur Burlesquers
playing in Herne the Hunted, at
the Gaiety, Mrs. Cecil-Rosna-
WoREs-CLAY lent her invaluable
assistance. The Amateurs did
enough to show thatstep-dancing,
banjo-playing... comic-singing
pantomime ies and leaps, an
the power of delivering punning
dialogue, are not the exclusive
. of the profession. The
urlesque cost many hundreds to
t up, but the Artists' General
nevolent institution is to re-
ceive £500 from the players, who
have done their best to Herne it.
CRICKET INTELLIGENCE.
CAMBRIDGE is likely to show
a bold front adorned with three
STUDDs.
GUSH ABOUT THE BARD.
DID we say that SHAKSPEARE, though the greatest of Poets, “could
not write a tolerable play for a nineteenth century audience”?
“Why, certainly.” W. did say it, in a notice of Othello at the
Lyceum, and westick to it. Of course he “could” do so, and would,
were he alive now; but that’s quite another thing. Is therºsingle
lay of SHARsPEARE's of which there is not “an acting edition”?
he late Tom Robertson, Actor, Author, and excellent Stage Manager,
used to say, “I should like to see a modern Manager's face as he sat
listening to Mr. SHAKSPEARE (a recently successful Author) reading
his manuscript play of Macbeth.” The very first lines in the first
Scene would stagger him, even though the nervous Dramatist might
read it in his most impressive manner. Wouldn't he at once tº:
cutting out the “hurlyburly,” “Graymalkin,” and “Paddock”f
Perhaps he might leave this lastin, if produced in the Derby week.
And when the Three Witches turned up again in Scene iii., worse
than ever, wouldn't the practical Manager ask what on earth “the
sailor's wife who had chestnuts in her lap” had to do with the plot?
And wouldn't he say that the audience would roar at “the rat with-
out a tail” and “the pilot's thumb,” and that in fact these Witches
would play the deuce with the K. ? -
Mr. §º. SHARSPEARE, Poet, Dramatist, Actor, Manager, and
the greatest Genius of his own or of any other age, feathered his nest
very comfortably by writing for a sixteenth century audience, and he
would very soon re-arrange his plays, so as to suit them to the taste
of “a nineteenth century, audience,” which, having . cos-
tumes, and attractive heroines, wishes that as little as possible may
be left to its imagination—as was nearly everything in SHAKSPEARE's
time—and that the whole “Show” should be compressed into three
hours' entertainment at most.
RE-viewing IT.-" Lord SALISBURY,” says the World, “is the
ideal of a Quarterly Reviewer.” We should rather have said that
his Lordship is a Give-no-Quarterly Reviewer.

Our Bus-Driver. “'Stonishin' THE AMEwsMENT THE ARRY-stocracy FINDs IN IT, SIR
Y’ KNow, SIR-gives 'EM FRESH AIR, AN' occyPIEs THEIR MINDs,
I MEAN, SIR 1 ""
BUT P'RHAPs IT's A GooD THING,
AN' KEEPs 'EM out o' THE PUBLIC-'ouse—LEASTwAYs THE CLUBs,
AN IMPROBABLE STARTER.
A HoRSE, has been, named for the National Prosperity Stakes,
against backing which we caution the public. This horse is an
animal now called Reciprocity, and said to be by Depression (or
#.º. of the foreign-bred Tariff. The market is being
insidiously but assiduously rigged in its favour by a certain “ring,'
of shady antecedents, who believe they see a chance of landing a
nice little stake at the public expense. Without being exactly a
popular favourite, Reciprocity is not altogether without genuine
support in some quarters, and many who have a sneaking penchant
for the āj stock, rather fancy its chance, and are backing it
quietly. We are convinced, however, that the animal is a rank
impostor, and sailing under entirel iaise colours. in fact, we have
reason to believe that this so-called Reciprocity is none other than
our old friend—or enemy—Protection, under a new name. Protec-
tion at one time was a great favourite, but proved to be a non-stayer
and an arrant rogue, and having broken down badly, was scratched
at the last moment for the race ultimately won by that “horse of
the century,” the stout and speedy Free Trade, by Bobby Peel, out
of Political Economy. , Since then we have heard little of him, but
we more than suspect that the discredited Protection turns up again
“with a fresh coat of paint” in this dark Reciprocity, about whose
antecedents there seems so much mystery, and the proceedings of
whose stable are open to such strong suspicion. Even if the brute
should start, he could not possibly win, as his stock never show
staying powers over a long course, and invariably “cut it” at the
inch. ut, beyond this, we believe that he will be disqualified
fore the day of the race, and we strongly advise backers to have
nothing to do, on any terms, with the horse or its supporters. Verb.
Sap.
“A HoRSE,” observed a Scotch Wet., “may have a very good appe-
tite, and yet be unable to eat a bit.” “Ah,” said 'ARRY, “there's
the difference between a 'oss and a ostridge, which could eat bit,
snaffle, curb and all.”
A WARNING TO THE WAGS.
THIS being the Derby Week, it may not be out of place to point
out the fact to the Waterloo Wags, That a race-meeting was about
to occur would of course be self-evident to any other Railway Com-
any interested in the transport of holiday-makers to the great
É. Carnival; but judging by past years, this event (and indeed
all others of a like description) comes as a complete surprise to Mr.
ARCHIBAL.D Scott and his merry Masters. The London and South
Western ought perhaps to be accustomed to a pressure upon its
traffic, for it is directly occupied in providing trains for meetings at
Epsom, Sandown, Kempton, Ascot, Egham, Windsor, Stockbridge
ampton, Salisbury, Weymouth, Southampton, Winchester, an
Aldershot, and also for the Oxford and Cambridge Boat-race.
In the matter of raising prices the L. & S. W. R. is sufficiently
alert, remembering the g old adage, that “None but the brave
| deserve the fare.” Here, however, the valour ends, as the Wags
| consign, the entire management of their manoeuvres on these
favourite and field days to their favourite commander, General
Block. And, strange as it may seem, there are those who, ignoring
the advantages of communism in compartments and tickets, of stop-
pages at Nowhere Station, and of unutterable confusion at Some-
where Station, do not appreciate this particular Block System.
The Aye has It l
“PRONoUNCED as one letter and written with three"
Is the place that he sits for pert Lord RANDOLPH. C.
“All my Eye,” he may call it, §.; cock o' the walk,
And in that it extremely resembles his talk.
The Member for Eye has some sparkle and flash,
But he doesn't look pretty when under the lash.
Becoming his perch ill and bearing the birch ill,
“Ware HARTINGTON l’’’s surely the “tip” for Lord CHURCHILL.

THE DERBY.
(By the Veteran’s Uncle.)
“HE who goes once to the Derby by road, does so as an experiment; he
who goes twice is a fool,” did not some maundering dotard say with no go or
fun about him * He who would go by road when he can go by rail, deserves
to be treated in the American fashion, and “rode on a rail,” as I remarked
once at DELMoxico's, in New York, a real snappy restaurant; though for a
fourteen-year-old-mutton-cut-and-come-again-old-port-and-carried-up-to-
bed-by-the-Boots sort of house, give me the “Old George” at Ranksborough
Gorze. I like the road with its quaint ways and antiquated tricks. Give me the
-shooter–didn't the Bishop—he and I were “boys, merry, merry boys” at
}. on the Hill together-just jump when I pinned him with a real stinger on
his off calf º Give me the bags of flour—you should have seen the Duke's face
when I landed him one on the near optic. But he and I have heard the chimes
at midnight, when we haven't been asleep, often together, and after a quarter of
an hour's hearty, genial swearing at me, and threatening to break every bone in
my body, he went off as if nothing had happened. But there, where can you
match our British Aristocracy?
Once more in the Paddock. The prettiest sight, after all, is to see the horses
paraded. What have we here * Why, the favouriteſ “Any good?” asks
our popular Prince, who always comes to the Veteran of Veteransfor the straight
tip. “How about his feet?’
“Sir” I said, “though ridden by WEBB, he is not web-footed.”
H.R.H. took the tip, and went off screaming with laughter.
“What do you think of my chance?” asks Tom CANNoN.
“You are up on Geologist,” I replied. “Well, a geologist breaks stones, and
if you get stone broke, why—” But he wouldn't stop for the finish; and why
he didn't fall off with laughing, puzzles me now.
“Ha, ha!” I say, as I recognise Mr. Legh. “You are the best dressed man
on the course; but with a TEDDY WEEven to train, and a Tom My GLovER, Six
Buttoned GLovER to ride, you ought to be well groomed.” When he had recovered
I said, “Be careful about your horse Sir Charles, he is out of {º: and
if hedon't win, you will be out of prosperity too.” That knocked him fairly.
“Dame Durden is an old catch, my Lord,” says.I., “and
if Cameliard or Town Moor wins, it will be a great catch
for the Durdans,” but though I hit “Rosey” in the ribs
with my umbrella, he did not see it. He is a Scotchman.
“So you are going to pink us Britishers,” is my
cheering remark to Pincus, the American trainer.
“We are going to court fortune with Iroquois and
Barrett, and —.”

THE MEETING OF THE “WATERS.”
How do the Waters come down on the Public?
Here they come bouncing,
All rivals denouncing,
“Untradesmanlike falsehoods” tremendously trouncing.
Swearing that hurt is meant
By foe's advertisement;
Public ear stuffing,
And rubbish be-puffing.
Greek meeting Greek—in the crackjawish names of 'em;
Polyglot rot setting forth bogus claims of 'em.
uaciously gassing
Of merits surpassing,
Phosphates and carbonates, jargon empirical
Blazoning each pseudo-medical miracle,
Taunting and vaunting,
Their praises loud chaunting,
And bothering and pothering,
And boasting, and posting
On hoardings and boardings
Their pictures and strictures,
And much advertising,
And circularising;
Till one wishes the roar
Of these Waters were o'er,
And votes the whole business no end of a bore.

ROO-º-TOO-TOO"-ING IT.
“G. A. S.” in his Echoes tells
us an anecdote of what two little
black-stockings said when seeing
the AEsthetes at the Prince of
Wales's Theatre. Here’s an-
other nannygoat. Mamma and
two daughters, all quite too ut-
terly Too-Too, sat in the Stalls,
and after expressing a languid
monosyllabic interest in the play,
said, one to the other, “Such too
absurd people can’t possibly exist
in what we know as ‘real life.’”
Mamma observed that Mrs. MUR-
RAY as Lady Tompkins, was a
“monstrous abnormalism.” The
youngest ventured to remark that
she had heard of a certain de-
signing person called Mr. Du
MAURIER, who caricatured “The
Beautiful” in a Philistine jour-
nal called Punch; and then the
three having settled, during the
entr’acte, that the entire dra-
matis personae were but “the gro-
tesque reflections of a deformed,
cracked, and blurred mirror,”
composed themselves to listen to
the remainder of the piece with
painful, joyless pleasure.
The Bee-Division.
A swary of bees appeared in
the Strand last week, and col-
lected close to the stage-door of the
Gaiety. Theatre. Mr.TEGETMETER
was sent for, and he succeeded in
hiving them with little difficulty.
Later on in the evening the usual
swarm of stage-door loungers
assembled at the same place, ob-
structing the traffic and causing a
public scandal. The police au-
thorities were sent for—not for
the first time—and they declined
to remove the nuisance. Negotia-
tions are pending with Mr.TEGET-
METER to restore the bees, mixed
with a few wasps and hornets.

Elegance with Economy.
THE Rational Dress Society has
great raison d'être. What can be
much more reasonable than trying
to promote individual taste, in
the choice of attire; to improve
feminine costume with respect to
health, comfort, and beauty; and
to limit the fashions to changes
requisite on those grounds alone?

lors also of moderate means who
N would fain marry but fear to,

N happiness would be cheapened by
the success of the Rational Dress

its Associates, in that point, from
those ancient Bloomers whose
grotesque attempts at Dress
Reform were as blossoms nipped

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY WAITER.
RoberT ON THE THAMEs,
I DON'T think I was ever so thorowly disapinted and disgusted in
all my life as I was last week, and I reelly was not so shoct as I no
doubt ought to ha’ been, when I herd a werry rispectable but egsited
Waterman observe, “if this sort of thing’s a going to be aloud, the
sooner we has a sangwinary revolution the better l’’
A werry old friend of mine is what I should call a reglar desperate
fishmonger. I don't mean a Billingsgate cormorant nor a Charing
Qross Grove, but a man who gives hisself up art and sole to catching
fishes in the water. Well, he asked me the other day to go and have
a day's fishing with him, witch of course I was only too glad to
except, as a change of life is always agreeable.
Well, we went by train to a nice clean little plaice quite beyond
Stains, and there we hired a Punt, and off we set, and my friend having
arranged all the tackling, there we sat for about 2 hours, watching
the flotes, I think they calls 'em, bobbing up and down in the water,
and tho' it warn’t howdashusly egsiting, as we didn't get more than
2, nibbles and 1 bite, yet still, as the sun was a shining like one a
clock, and the banks of the river was that lovely that you might
almost think that it was just a little bit of Paradise left out as a
sample, specially as NED hadn't forgot to put an Amper on board
with lots of cold beef and a gallon of beer, I enjoyed myself quite as
much as if I’d din a dining off the Poultry near Cornhill.
Well, about 4 o'clock it §. to cloud over, and then it begun to
mizzle, and I natrally thort that, as the wulgar say, we should mizzle
toº, but NED said oh no, that was just wot we wanted to make the
fish bite, for it seems they are such precious fools that they think
that no sensible fellow would ever be such a Ideot as to set in a wet
boat in the pouring rain just for the chance of catching a few her-
rings, and a moral certainty of catching cold. And so it turned out,
for by the time we had both got jolly well wet through, the fish began
to bite like fun oh, and I had just hooked my first 'un, quite a *.
nearly 6 inches long I should think, when a Gent, on one of the
lawns that runs down to the river, shouts out to us, “Now then, you
fellers, just you be off with you, or I'll spile your sport for you.’
Of course we treated him with all the contemp one can manage to
show when one’s wearing a Sow Wester and is wet through. So
what did he do but calls up a large New Foundling Dog, and throw-
ing a tick into the water close to our punt, sends in the Dog to fetch
it out !
Well, to shorten my tail, there was no use our fishing no more
after that, so, wet as we was, we just showered a few blessings Oil
that Gent's homerd head, to which I added a pious ope that I might
some day have the honner of waiting upon him at dinner, wen
p'raps he'd hardly know which was the reel waiter of the 2, and so
to town, just in time for a grand Bangwet at the Fishmongers Haul.
This is a plane, unlackerd tail of wot took plaice only last week,
and now comes the only little bit o' consolashun I has in eluding to it.
I sumtimes hears, but oftner reads, a tax upon the old Coppera-
tion; with that of course I’ve nothink to do as it isn't in my line
and I'm naterally predejuiced in their favour from my perfeshn
ayacations. But I’m axshally told by BRowN, who has it from a
Mr. LEDGER (he ort to be a Marchant or a sporting man with that
name he ort) that the Copperation has promised as they’ll look into
this matter, and if any amount of trubble, or money, or law, can
put a stopper on it, or rayther as I should say in it, it shall be done.
Well, if that’s how they spends their leisure time and their sur-
plice cash, fust in saving open spaces and then in saving open rivers,
why all I can say is, I believes there are tens of thousands of Lon-
doners who willjine me in saying, “More power to their elbow !”

I always connected it with a pastrycook of that name,

built this bridge to connect his business with the town.
It may not be spelt “Barnes,” it may be “Barns,” or it
may be “Bairns Bridge;” i.e., the Boys' Bridge. I
know. not. Here are “Sock.” Shops. “Sock” means
sweeties, and stuffing generally. The verb “to Sock” is
active and º; never neuter, and seldom reflective.
You and I have “Socked” at JAMEs's,
Here is “Tap’”—where we weren't allowed to go,

and see the splendidly-attired boys start in the boats for
Surly Hall. "Why"Surly'?” Don't know, any more
than I did about Barnes, as there is nothing surly about
the place, as everything is jovial there, and, it is only
aSSOCla with festivities. There was a sulky water-
man, on the Thames called. HALL, invariably chaffed by
the boys as “Surly Hall”—but I don't think he gave
his name to this property; indeed Ifancy it must have

“HEADS, WE WIN!”
IN lººking over the Metropolitan §. of the last Census, it is satisfactory
to find that “slums,” if not absolute #. have been much reduced in
number and population. St. Giles's, Holborn, the Strand, Shoreditch, White-
chapel, St. George's-in-the-East, and Westminster show a considerable reduc-
tion of heads compared with 1871, while the half-rural suburbs of Hackney,
Bethnal-Green, Mile End, and Poplar show an enormous increase in this
direction. London has grown a roun million during the last twenty years, and
has over three millions and eight hundred thousand inhabitants. ith a .
lation nearly equal to that of the whole of Ireland, it has hardly one-tenth of
the Irish Parliamentary representation, and on every question affecting its
domestic comfort—the hours of closing and opening its taverns, the .# of
its amusements, and the brightness or f; of its Sundays—it is out-voted by
every miserable puritanical Little Peddlington, which returns one, and in some
cases two Members for a few hundred voters. This is what is called Legislation

THEORY AND PRACTICE.
“SIR WILFRID is quite right. It is demoralising, it paralyses the
business of the country, it provokes thirst, it encourages intoxica-
tion.” Such were our old friend Jones's sentiments on the Monday
before the Derby, in the presence of his dear wife—who had brought
him a fortune and was a trifle older than himself, which had brought
wisdom; she was also a member of a strict Scotch Presbyterian
Tºº Society, which º rudence.
... “Besides, my dear,” he added, “I have business of the utmost
importance to attend to on that day, and so,” &c., &c.

We saw him again—only once.
“We saw him for a moment,
But methinks we see him now,”
with a false nose on, three dolls in his white hat (smashed), and
trying to play a tin trumpet as an accompaniment to two other idiots
similarly attired, in a broken-down fly, lying by the roadside on the
way home from the Derby, June 1. The nose fell off, and we recog-
nised our old friend Jones. “Always the same-Banjo and Bones!—
always the same-with your old friend Jones!” he tried to sing out
as we passed and left him under the watchful eye of the turnpike-
keeper and a policeman.
GOING TO THE BARD-IN GERMAN.
THE Theatrical Event of the past week has been the appearance of
the Meiningen Company at Drury Lane. The mise-en-scène of Julius
Caesar was very nearly perfect: marred only by the two interiors,
Scene 2, of Act II., in Caesar's House, and Scene 3, Act IV., in the tent
of Brutus, the latter especially belonging to that peculiar branch of
theatrical art known as SRELT's Scenes for To eatres, twopence
coloured, familiar to childhood's days. Had it been the Dutch Com-
any instead of the German, the taste for “the SKELT.” style would
ve been intelligible—at least, such is the opinion of his Excellency
Le Baron,0sy D'ANVERs, who may be considered a thoroughly im-
partial critic.
In the scenes where what the Bard calls “the rabble” are shown,
the Meiningen stage-management is simply admirable, and the effect
in the celebrated º situation was really thrilling.
Great praise is due to Herr BARNAY (is he an Irishman in disguise?
there’s a sort of bedad twang about “Barnay’” that sounds sus-
picious) for his acting throughout this scene from first to last.
Caesar (RICHARD), and Cassius (TELLER), were both good, specially
Cassius. The one idea of these Actors in this Fº excepting
always Misther BARNAY (more power to his elbow! though the wish is
superfluous) is evidently-Bappy Thought—“when in doubt, strike
an attitude. We are nothing if not classical and strictly correct.”
The assassination of Caesar was very impressive. It had the
appearance of each of the conspirators wishing to whisper a good
joke to Caesar, and separately enforcing the point with a dig in the
ribs from a stick or an umbrella or whatever might come handiest.
But all the killing and suiciding—and there’s plenty of it in Herr
SHAKseraRE's play-is awkward and ludicrous.
Where every detail is supposed to be fixed by the weightiest
authority, we confess we were very anxious to see what the
Meiningen School made of SHAKSPEARE's direction for Scene 2,
Act II., “Thunder and lightning. Enter Caesar in his nightgown.”
The very first lines show that the Bard meant that Julius—we had
yery nearly written Sir Julius–had just got out of bed hurriedly,
his rest having been spoilt by Calphurnia's talking in her sleep—so
very annoying; granting, however, that the “night-gown” was the
robe de chambre, yet to our eagle eye there wasn't much difference
between it and his day-gown, and it was of such a brilliantcolour as
must have given Calphurnia fits on seeing it for the first time. But
why did Julius Caesargo to bed in his crown of golden laurel-leaves?
Was he such a conceited snob that he couldn't bear the idea of being
taken at a disadvantage by some indiscreet domestic, and of not being
always a hero, even to his valet de chambre? Why did he sleep in
that crown? Hasn’t the Bard expressly said, “Uneasy lies the
head that wears a crown,” and no wonder Julius couldn't get a wink
of sleep with that stupid thing on his head, let alone Calphurnia
talking blank-verse in her sleep.
The finishing scenes were weak, and actually people yawned over
The fine bold Roman Hand.

scene, but these were evidently among the poor uneducated ºccupier:

well-informed person evidently,
replied that “he didn't think there would be any firing,”—but his
tone was neither confident nor reassuring. - -

A SENATORIAL DIARY.
(Very much in the Future.)
VARIous London Correspondents of provincial newspapers have
been lately publishing “rumours emanating from authentic sources,”
to the effect that Mr. GLADSToxE contemplates resigning the post of
Chancellor of the Exchequer to Mr. CHILDERs or Sir W. CourT,
and º; a Peerage. In profound horror at the thought,
Mr. Punch feels bound to publish a prospective page from the
future diary of the PREMIER in the Senate.
Monday.-Go down to the Peers for the first time. Brimful of
subjects; have just composed a capital Peroration to my speech on
Thames Water Biii.; alsº evasive and diplomatic answers to (pro-
bable) questions on Transvaal, Afghanistan, Ireland, &c.; also my
list of arguments for the new scheme for making repentant burglars
eligible for election to the Upper House of Convocation.
6. P.M.–Arrive at House. Doors shut! Ask policeman why.
Policeman very respectful: , says House has risen an hour ago:
and it only met at four ! I ask, what has happened to Thames
Water Bill? Policeman doesn't know, but rather thinks Lord
REDESDALE “put it under the Woolsack:” offers to lend me even-
jº to see what did happen to Bill. Accept offer with thanks.
Bill read a Second Time without discussion / And this is called a
Deliberative Assembly I Wonder if GRAN VILLE did the diplomatic
and evasive answers. Drop into Peers' Gallery of House of Commons.
Splendid and refreshing shindy going on. RANDoLPH more perky,
if possible, than usual. PARNELL badgering ForsTER, HARTINGTON
hitting out splendidly with his left, Wish I were there! Find
myself, constantly catching SPEAKER's eye: must really get over
this habit. Leave House, and go to see IRVING in Othello instead.
Tuesday.—Take luncheon down to House, as I am determined to
be in good time to-day: old lady sweeping out the Gilded Chamber,
seems surprised to see me sitting here.
4 P.M.–Question-time, but no questions ! Feel inclined to ask
myself a lot. This comes of there being no Home-Rulers in Upper
House. Who is it who says, “Oh, for one hour of DANDolo!” Don't
know, think it was BYRON. Oh, for only half-an-hour of HEALY!
Wonder if HEALy would accept a Peerage on condition of coming
down here and badgering me with questions every evening. Must
sound him about it. Is that a Bishop that I see fast asleep a long
way off at the end of that empty bench : Am just thinking of making
a personal explanation, or asking a few questions (without notice) of
Lords SALISBURY, CRANBRook, LYTTON, &c., when–House rises'
I ask GRAN VILLE, bitterly, if Peers are always like this. He smiles,
and says something about “a pleasant change after worry of Lower
Chamber.” Hopes it will give me, “mental repose!” To Peers'
Gallery of Commons again. Dear old CHAPLIN making no end of a
shindy. Should hardly have known Sir STAFFoRD : he has become
eyer so much more vivacious since I left House. Find myself crying
silently several times when I think of my House of Commons days.
Can't stand it any longer. Go off to Exeter Hall, and preside over
a Children's Tea-Party: “to such base uses,” &c. Several times
on the point of calling the Superintendent of the children “the
Right Hº Lady l’’. Must really conquer this habit.
hursday.—Note from Editor of Nineteenth Century: another from
Editor of Cºntemporary, Both say “my articles very good, but
too many of them.” Ask me to send them “not more than one article
a week,” as their space is limited. Happy Thought-Write a Novel.
Will think about it, and try.
Another letter—from Lytton. Promises to ask me a question to-
night about Quettah! Good fellow, LYTrox Wish I hadn't
opposed him so about Candahar, &c.
5 P.M.–House. Attendance as usual-scanty, but dignified.
Thanks to dear old LYTToN, have got out my diplomatic and evasive
} reply about Afghanistan at last. There were quite three Peers lis-
tening to it, a more than average audience, GRAN VILLE assures me.
W. three then go off to dinner, and House rises for another fort-
night.
7 P.M.–Can't help it. Back in Commons—Peers' Gallery—as
before. Fancy HARTINGTON doesn't like my being here and sending
him constant tips as to what answers to give, arguments to use, &c.
Does he feel in a position of greater freedom and less responsibilit

(Wide Dr. Johnson.)
WE read in the columns of a suburban—not to say
country—contemporary:—
“Those who have the patience to angle for trout can now
have an opportunity of exercising their skill, as there are two
very nice fish to be captured, one opposite the Eel Pie Island
Hotel, and the other, the larger of the two, opposite Poulett
Lodge, the residence of Mr. J. E. MEEK.”
This is a practical carrying out of the old tale—
“No use your fishing in that river, Sir ; it was caught
esterday.” And if, thanks to Hillingsgate and other
idiocies, our fish continue to decrease as rapidly as they
are now doing, we shall soon have the sorrow to read:—
Brighton.—A fine sole was seen off here this morning.
A *. train will be run to-day for the convenience
of Anglers. So good a chance of sport has not been
known for years, and the ardent fishermen of the town
are in high spirits.
Bournemouth.-BILL STOKEs, the fisherman, says he
saw a conger-eel off the Pier yesterday; but as he has not
been sober, for six years, and is the most, mendacious
herson in this town (which is saying a good deal), very
ttle trust is placed in his assertion.
Ramsgate.—Messrs. PATERNosTER AND PIUMMETT, the
celebrated tackle-makers, declare that while sailing off
the North Foreland }. they disturbed two
whiting pout. A whole flotilla of boats has set sail,
and Messrs. P. & P. have sold out their stock–in–trade
at a handsome profit; (Later by Telegram.)—Nothing
having been seen of the two fish, a suspicion is growing
abroad that their existence is entirely due to the men-
dacious statements of Messrs. P. & P. We hope, for the
honour of Ramsgate, that none of her tradesmen would
have resorted to such a strategy to promote business.
#: News.)—The mob have wrecked Messrs. P. &
.'s shop, and are now proceeding to duck the proprietors
in the harbour.
Tenby:-This town has been thrown into a state of
wild excitement by the fact of one of our summer visitors
having captured a splendid dab weighing at least 3 oz.
The church-bells were set ringing, and the Vicar made
a touching allusion to the event in his sermon on Sunday,
an allusion he will probably consider premature when he
discovers that the visitor, whose name is unknown, has
quitted Tenby without paying for the beer of the bell-
ringers.
RUM REFLECTION ON THE RUM TAx.—Ah! we lead an
Exchequered existence!
MET PROFITS,
Something about them—from a Turbot's Diary.
“Mr. J. T. BEDFond contended that Billingsgate was a melancholy failure
from a public point of view, and said that when originally created a market
there was no railway, or it would never have been erected at the river-side.
He cited instances of deliberate tricks and artifices on the part of the trade to
enhance the price of fish, and as an instance of how cheap fish was, he men-
tioned the fact that a public orphanage in Kent was supplied direct from
Grimsby with assorted fish in season, including cod, at a price of less than
twopence per pound.”—Report of Meeting of Court of Common Council.
3 A.M.–Like a fool, came up for a spin in the upper current this
morning, and managed somehow to get into a net. Hauled in with
a large take, and was tumbled with the rest of them into the bottom
of a smack, and kept there while they wired up to London to know
how many of us were wanted to rig the marketproperly. Heard some-
one say, “Why, BILL, if the Guv'ner wos to send up this 'ere haul,
the whole of it, bless me if they couldn't sell the finest fish you like
to pick out at tuppence a pound, and make a good thing of it, too, at
the figure.” Wonder whether they’ll do it.
4 A.M.–Telegram arrived. Four-fifths of the take to be pitched
back into the water. Well, whoever does go back won't get over it,
that's all I know about it. Feel melancholy. Catch someone
saying, “Well, a wicked waste I calls it; with meat at eleyenpence
a pound, and thousands, a-starving, to throw away good food like
this 'ere !” Say good-bye to my great-grandfather, fifty stray
uncles, and the rest of my famil ği of 'em done for), and am

was in such a pandemonium before. Pick up from a Stale Sole that
it’s Billingsgate. Immensely disappointed; -
8 A.M.–Am wondering, in low spirits, what I º to fetch a
und, when I find I’ve been bought up already with a lot of other
ellows, by a sort of recognised brigand, that they call in these parts
a "Middleman.” As far as we can make out, he has managed to
collar the whole lot of us at about threepence a pound, and has sold
us to a leading West End tradesman,-no doubt, at a profit. Still
keep wondering what I shall fetch ultimately. On my way West, go
up Bond Street, and am chaffed by a lobster in tremendous spirits,
% savs that he has nearly split himself with laughing at the thought
that when he’s boiled, he’ll fetch seven-and-sixpence.
3 P.M.–Arrive at my destination. Hope I shall cut up well. Am
about to be sliced, when I’m sent off to “Stucco House,” wherever
that is, for an eight o'clock dinner. Get out of a red mullet, who
says he ought to be “three a penny,” but has just been entered in
the book at one and ninepence, that I am supposed, to be “scarce”
to-day, and figure at half-a-guinea: , Proud, but sad. Pass a hungry
beggar on my way, and wish I could let him have a couple of my
uncles for fourpence. - - - - -
8 P.M.–Come to table. Am well walked into, by highly distin-
guished company—mostly City men who think that, *. 85 per
cent of all the fish that comes to London is conveyed by train,
“Billingsgate does cery well where it is.” Am, put into the larder
and finished suddenly by the cat. Curious. A highly instructive
day. To Chaos reflecting.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Mowday Night, May 30,—MITCHELL HENRY not usually reckoned
among the dangerous classes of Members of Parliament. He is too
lump in person and too uncertain of his sº sentences to be
ormidable. Not infrequently comes down in his war-paint, and
makes ready to run amuck at somebody. , But usually very little
bloodshed, and much good-humoured laughter owing to his jokes
breaking out in the wrong place. To-night showed that it is never
safe to disregard an adversary. Mr. PARNELL little, thought
MITCHELL HENRY would bring him to grief. But he did, hitting
out some very smart raps at the proprietor of the Irish Vote. De-
lightful air of innocence and absence of intention to mean anythin
º: by his reference to “gentlemen who, in moments o
r, hide in London and give out that they are in Paris.” -
about PAT EGAN, who has been writing a letter denouncin
O'ConnoR Power and other Members as blacklegs, because they di
not do as bidden by Mr. PARNELL. So ridiculously sensitive, Irish
Members!...This is only PAT's way of expressing a difference of
opinion with his countrymen, and marks the advance of civilisation.
A few years Aşg PAT would have brought his shillelagh down on the
head of Mr. O'ConnoR Power. Now he is content with calling him
a blackleg ; and still MITCHELL HENRY is not happy.
O'Connor PoweR made a fine manly speech, creating some con-
sternation in the Land League camp by the production of telegrams,
showing how prominent Land Leaguers, whilst abusing the Govern-
ment at the top of their voice, whisper solicitations for appointments
to Government offices.
Curious to notice how the end of it all was that Mr. PARNELL3.
before the House and Ireland—particularly Ireland—as a down-
trodden martyr., Accusations had been made against him, and he
had been refused a hearing; this after making two speeches, in which
he said very little about Mr. PAT EGAN, but lamented the untruth-
fulness of the Hoxſe SECRETARY. Very clever device this, though
growing tedious by reason of repetition.
Business done.-Private #. one hour. Questions two hours.
Irish row two hours. Land Bill three hours and a half. More Irish
row with incidental voting of Supply two hours.
Tuesday Night.—House getting a little aweary with RANDoIPH.
Beginning to doubt whether his humour is anything more than
impudence, and asks whether, if his father had been a butcher
instead of the titled descendant of a great soldier, he would have
been tolerated so long. To-night the House hailed with great delight
the temporary extinction of his lordlingship by the SoLICITOR-
GENERAL. All the more welcome, because unexpected. Mr. JoHN-
son, like all his official colleagues who have anything to do with
Ireland, has a subdued manner indicative of much mental suffering
and reminiscent of many encounters with Mr. HEALY and Mr.
CALLAN. Therefore, when to-night JoHNsoN showed that he had in
.Pºtionary materials for a smart retort, the House surprisingly
elate01.
RANDoIPH had come down to talk about potatoes on a matter-of-
fact and well-meant Motion by Major NoLAN. Talked for an hour
but chiefly used up the potatoes to shy at Ministers. House bor
to death. Tried once or twice to get itself counted out. SPEAKER
interposed with dignified rebuke. RANDOLPH having been chattering
for half a hour in phrases connected only by vituperative denuncia-
tion of the Government, the SPEAKER observed with touching dignity,
*funderstand the Nobie Lord rose to Second the Motion; he has not
}. approached it.” Enough this to shut up an ordinary man.
ANDoIPH not an ordinary man. So long as he can keep clear of
the penalties which the SPEAKER may enforce, doesn't care a . r
for his rebuke. But he winced when the ordinarily down-trodden
SolICITOR-GENERAL for IRELAND “regretted that the Noble Lord
had not taken advantage of his travels about Ireland at other
people's expense to acquire that knowledge of the subject of the
#. which he had taken upwards of an hour to show that he
id not possess.” RANDoLPH begins to think he must keep his eye
on the SoLICITOR-GENERAL for IRELAND.
Another nuisance of the House's own creation put down to-day.

attempts to murder in the same locality, all attributed to the action

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
BRUTUs.—“You are wrong,” writes BRUrus, “in quoting “The harmless
nece cat' as out of Othello. It's from The Merchant of Venice.
Every idiot knows that.” One does, tº:
Toto.—“The harmless necessary cat”—is undoubtedly to be found in The
Merchant and not The Moor of Venice. It is almost certain, however
that SHAKspeARE himself went to Wenice and there became uninted
with both the Moor and the Merchant, which, as is suggested by the frag-
ments of the Half-Folio, was in all probability the title of his first series
of Venetian Plays—(1) The Moor and the Merchant; (2) The Moor;
(3) The Merchant, of which only the two last have come down to us. Now
in these f ents, with which it is a pity students are so imperfectl
acquainted, The Moor, and the Merchant, the “tail-less (not harmless
necessary cat” is mentioned by the Moor who wishes to obtain a high price
for such a rarity, as was one of the Manx species in those days, from the
Merchant Shylock who would have given anything to his favourite
daughter Desdemona, while he was cruel to his younger child Jessica.
The Moor had brought the cat straight from Barbary, into which country
its ancestor had been imported by an Englishman, one RICHARD WHIT-
TINGTox. The Merchant is frightened, and then the Moor explains that
the animal in question is “harmless,” and repeats the remainder of the
line. The subject is interesting, and when there is so much Moor about
just now, we are not surprised at a little wandering.

AND How Do You Like
ASCOT IN THE CAMERA,
(By Our Scientific Reporter.)
Accºping to the request of thousands that I would try the effect
of my Nitro-Galvanic Telescrophone instantaneous portrait-taker at
Ascot, I took my stand on the º
The reader must know then, that the Nitro-Galvanic Telescrophone
(as, indeed, its name would denote) is a machine for producing
historical scenes in their true colours—material and mental. By a
simple contrivance I have avoided that air of repose which spoils so
"...". and substituted for it a kind of artistic vivacity
which must be seen to be appreciated. The frame of my machine
is constructed exclusively of ivory, steel, ebonite, pewter, walnut
wood, 5. paper mâché, iron, buffalo, hide, and bamboo canes.
With these simple materials I have made a kind of casket, which
resembles º between a beer-barrel and a balloon. It has
all the * of the former, with many of the characteristics of
the latter. It can be easily transferred from }. to place, being
extremely portable. All that it requires in ordinary circumstances
is a few waggons and a couple of traction-engines. Of course com-
mon prudence would dictate the choice of a fine day for one of these
journeys, as the mixture of gun-cotton and paraffin (used in the
preparation of the sensitive plates) is apt to get a little out of order
when exposed to untoward atmospherie influences, However, with
proper care the Nitro-Galvanic Telescrophone is as easily managed
as anything else requiring a trifle more than ordinary attention—say
a rogue elephant, a wounded tiger, or a damaged fish-torpedo. It is
wor º electricity and portable hydraulic pumps.
Arrived at Ascot, I selected the turf in front of the Judge's chair
as the scene for my instantaneous picture, as it occurred to metha
the portrait of the winner of the chief race would be more interesting
than any other memorial. I therefore rejected the causerie on the
lawn, the Royal Procession up the Course, the group of drags at the
luncheon-hour in favour of the incident I have above specified.
The salient features of Ascot are so well known that it is unneces-
sary to refer to them. Charming toilettes, lovely faces, well-ap-
pointed turn-outs were to be seen as much this year as on any of its
predecessors.
The crowd assembled; some of the smaller events were settled;
lunch was commenced,—and then came the race of the day. It
was an anxious moment for me. I had arranged the apparatus
with the assistance of the police to keep off the crowd, but my sensi-
tive plates were rather behind-hand. Although prepared on very
simple principles, they have to undergo several processes, and in
their manufacture there had been several mishaps. For instance,
one had been broken by a steam Nasmyth hammer, acting with
rather too much force. Another had suffered from inferior bronze
being used in one of the castings, and a third had been ground to
dust in the Marble Polishing Department. In spite of these and
many other little accidents, I was able to secure one plate which was
in tolerably good order.
The supreme moment arrived. Built up on its portable iron and
granite pedestal, the Nitro-Galvanic Telescrophone was certainly a
striking object. I stood just under the principal lens, with the
chain in my hand, ready to pull the lever, All was ready. I saw
a flag fall in the distance. On came the horses galloping at full

shout. The winner was passing me! I pulled the chain!

to you. It is not quite what I intended, but there are all the mate-

On second thoughts, I select

“IL SERAGLIo; " or, PITTMAN's PEGASUS.
No form of entertainment ever tickles our sense, of humour so
thoroughly as genuinely serious Italian Opera, specially when inter-
reted by Italians. Taken from this point of view, comic Italian
pera, being intentionally funny, fails to amuse us in the same
way; and so, while delighted with Mdme: SEMERICH, pleased with
Mdlle. WALLERIA, charmed with the melodious Mozartiness of this
thoroughly Mozartian opera, Il sº and sufficiently entertained
with the conventional humour of M. GUILHARD, we should have
had only a mild evening but for the English libretto supplied by the
}. Poet-Laureate of the establishment, Mr. J. PITTMAN, whose
ibretti, far from being mere, servile translations, eyince much
original thought and rare poetic power, occasionally rising to the
reckless freedom of true genius. -
The story of Il Seraglio–as the advertisements spell it, or Il
Serraglio as . Poet
PITTMAN's book has
it—is of the simplest
and weakest kind.
Two ladies of un-
certain nationalit
called Constance an
Bionda, are , in the
power of Pacha Selim
and Osmin, his . . . .
Gardener!! Why the
Gardener? Is there
some hidden joke
about “guardin'
her”? However, joke
or no joke, this Osmin
acts as the Pacha's
chief adviser and
mqjor domo, but it is
evident to *...
except the amiable
- - - though misguided
Mahommedan, that this Osmin is merely a Pantaloon in Turkish
trowsers. The Pacha never, having seen a pantomime, is easily
imposed upon, and does not discover a fraud wº is so palpable to
an English audience.
These two ladies are about to escape from Pacha PITTMAN's Ser-
raglio with one Belmont, a fat French lover, looking like Raoul out
of The Huguenots after a course of indolence and cod-liver oil, and
Pedrillo, his Spanish servant, who, in Turkish costume, has also
imposed on the credulity of this weak-minded Selim Pacha—what a
set of characters!—when they are intercepted by the Gardener
condemned to death by Selim, and immediately afterwards pardone
by the same amiable autocrat. Instead of “Il Seſaglio, the title of
the story should have been, in true Turkish, “Bosh.”
However, ninety years ago it furnished MozART with opportunities
for the display of his genius; and so let us be thankful. The rondo
in Act First, the quartette, the drinking duet, Constance's solo and
Bionda's sparkling song in Act Second are the gems of the music.
Now let us leave these gems, and descend with our PITTMAN into
the mines of Librettist ore. Osmin, speaking of Pedrillo to Belmont,
exclaims violently—
“That scoundrel ! may his neck be broken . "
Whereupon Belmont, the fat French lover, remarks, aside—
“How rude! His tongue he won't unfetter.”
Isn't “how rude" delicious * So mild !
Pedrillo says to Belmont, who is anxious about CoNSTANCE—
“Be patient. Shortly your Constance,
With the Pacha, will return home
From a sail on the water.
Belmont. Great Heav'n' With him, she?”
There's fire for you! The Italian is “Con lui, oh pena /" but Poet
PITTMAN's Pegasus bore him above mere commonplace rendering.
Osmin asks Pedrillo about Belmont—
“Who's this stranger?
Pedrillo. By permission of the Pacha, he's admission.”
And Osmin, instead of prosaically returning “Is he?” replies,
poetically—
An Eastern Difficulty.
“That I care not, out must stay you.”
Constance, the heroine, thus grandly rejects the Pasha's suit:—
“I’ll yield thee ne'er, in vain thou wouldst dismay me!”
and continues apostrophising her absent lover—
“Love knows no transgression,
My heart's full possession
Thou, BELMoxt, shall have!
CoNstANce doth swear thee
By Heaven above,” &c., &c.
This is very fine. The comic scene where Pedril.0"makes old
Pantaloon Osmin drunk
in less than half a
brace of vocal shakes,
finishes with these two
lines, which are quite
worthy to rank with any
“exit couplet” spoken by
either of the Dromios in
The Comedy of Errors
or by the burlesque low-
comedy characters in The
Taming of the Shrew :-
“ Pedrillo. Let's go, lest
the Pasha, our master,
Might see us, to us would hap
disaster.”
All hail, great PITT-

“Wiva Backo 1."
“Thou rascal, durst to throw

reproachfully adds—
“BELMoNT, you hardly know

Your friend, SELIM PACHA, forget you—Never!”

THE IRISH DEWIL-FISH.
(Slightly altered from Victor Hugo.)
IT is difficult for those who have not seen it to believe in the
existence of the Irish Devil-Fish.
It is the º: incarnate! It is the Vague visualised
It is the Perverse, de profundis. It is the Aggravating, in
ercelsis.'
De profundis." In excelsis.' Ah!
From the depth of despair to the height of absurdity. ... Poilà '
Yet the Preposterous is also the Possible. The Devil-Fish exists
The Possible is a terrible matrix.
But the Abominable has also its raison d'être. It is certain that
the Wrong-doer at one end proves the existence of Wrong at the
#: At one end English wrong, at the other the Irish Devil-
lsil .
Again, Voilà '
What then is the Irish Devil-Fish?
It is the Hibernian Vampire.
It is the Death's-head at the feast of Conciliation.
It is one of the Amphibia of the shore which separates the
Wrongful from the Remedial.
Every malignant creature, like every perverted Intelligence, is a
Sphinx propounding terrible riddles.
The riddle of this particular Sphinx is hard, but it must be
answered.
By Courage, Patience, Promptitude.
º Courage, because, in face of the Sphinx-Chimaera, failure of
resolution is fatal.
Patience, because to strike prematurely or with ill-aim is as useless
as not to strike at all.
Promptitude, because not to strike when the moment for striking

e greature is formidable, but there is a way of resisting it.
The Devil-Fish, in fact, is only vulnerable *:::::: the #.
A vague mass endowed with a malignant will, many armed mis-
chief at the service of central watchfulness, the Evil Eye, secret and
sinister, guiding Briareus hands—subtle, far-reaching, swift-strik-
ini. what can be more horrible?
ut the Horrible is not º nor self-gendered.
Chimaeras are the issues of oly relations, the Devourer is at
once the Nemesis and the Sexton of all systems. In our world of
twilight Wrong breeds Monsters. Right alone can banish them
with a blow. -
The blow must be just, it must be firm, it must be opportune, it
must strike through the head to the heart.
Then the struggle is ended. The folds relax. The Monster drops
away like the slow detaching of bands. The Devil-Fish is dead!
AT THE HORSE SHOW.
THE Horse Show at Islington all men must own is
A good show, to give the promoters their due ;
The #. of the fair was the leaping of ponies,
Distingué, and Mike, and unlucky Frou-Frou.
When ponies and lads at the Yºº failing.
Fellin, how the crowd was convulsed with delight;
While gaily the hunters topped hurdle and railing,
As if a stout fox and swift hounds were in sight.
And there were the ladies, the sheen of whose dresses
Made all the arena and galleries gay;
The Princess was present, and little Princesses,
And leaders of fashion in gallant array.
In England the horse is a popular idol,
And so it befell that the show had its charms;
In fact, we might hint that a saddle and bridle
should one ay be placed on the national arms.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Thursday Night, June 9.-House supposed to be back to-day
after the Whitsun holidays; but many empty benches. , Scores of
the boys, begged off till, Monday. Head-Master back, looking as
if, he hadn't had much of a j. . Also Head-Usher HARcogRT,
who, in the continued absence of Mr. ForsTER, undertakes the Irish
class. Amongst the odd boys here is BEREsford Hope. . Rather
thinks that young BAI-Fourt is going to say something, and would
not miss it for the world. Old boy in highest spirits.
“How did you enjoy your Wetmonday, ToBY P” he asked me
just now.
My! how he chuckled after this. Most remarkable man at a
smile. Quite reverses the order of Nature as displayed in thunder
and lightning. When B. H. smiles, you hear the thunder first and
see the lightning after. -
Never forget the first time I heard him smile. He was standing
just above the Gangway, at the end of the front Opposition Bench,
where he now sits so as to make room for his nephew in the corner
seat below, an arrangement which RANDoIPH disturbs by appropriat-
ing it for himself. He was making a speech on some serious subject–
either the National Gallery, or the admission of parsons or women to
Parliament. He had his shoulders well up, his head on one side, his
left hand extended, with the fingers of his right beating into the palm
ºf it, driving home arguments. Suddenly there was heard in the
amber a most extraordinary sound, something between the click
of a gun and the gurgling of a dark pool. in which a strong swimmer
had just sunk. The flow of B. H.’s speech had stopped. I looked

up quickly, fearing º There he stood, in º the same
attitude; but gradually ...iº. remarkable explosion, his
mouth widened, his eyes twinkled, his whole body shook with joyous
convulsion. B. H. was laughing!
There was a joke somewhere. He had not arrived at it yet, but
like the watchman at Lizard Point, who flashes inland the news o
ships sailing up out of the waste of the Atlantic, he saw it coming
in the far distance, and this was the accustomed signal. The House,
more used to this sort of thing, began to laugh. Then B. H. grew
more expansive about the lower part of the face, more twinkling
about the eyes, and more convulsive in the neighbourhood of the
stomach. The House roared. The symptoms on the part of the
orator increased in intensity, and for some minutes this continued—
he standing there inarticulate, with left hand outstretched and the
fingers of the right hand resting in the palm, shoulders well up,
head on ºne side, mouth miraculously stretched, and eyes twinkling,
whilst Members tossed themselves to and fro on the benches in
uncontrollable laughter.
We never reached the joke, which was quite forgotten by the time
B. H. had wiped his eyes and the House had recovered from the
paroxysm of laughter. But we had a good smile, and perhaps, on
the whole, it was wiser not to wind up with the joke.
Got questions over unexpectedly early, and had the advantage of
hearing a short address from Mr. Monk. Not quite a cheerful
manner, Mr. Monk's. Believe his father was a bishop, or a dean, or
a verger. º something in the Church. However this be,
Mr. Monk always brings a strong flavour of the pulpit into the
º details of the House of Commons' conversation.
“Tell you what, Toby,” Sir CHARLEs DILKE said, as we smoked
a cigar on the Terrace just now, “I never hear Monk ask a ques-
tion in the House but I fancy. I have a Prayer Book in my hand
instead of a copy of the 9rders, and I instinctively look at it
expecting to find written, "In quires and places where they sing
here followeth the anthem.’”
Believe that, our hard-working Chaplain, after performing the
duties of the Sitting, always stays when Mosk is going to make a
speech. Says he never gets such a good sleep. Makes him feel
uite at home, or rather at church. To-night Mr. Monk lost some
sheets of his notes, and floundered into “fourthly’ before he had
quite disposed of “...twothly.”
“Serves him right for not bringing his sermon down properly sewn
together in a black cover,” says Mr. QNsLow, whose political affec-
tions are divided between publican and parson, and who is quick to
resent an apparent slight to either. -
After Mr. Monk had reached the application and dismissed the
congregation, the House re-
solved itself into Committee of
Supply, when we had Sir
ANDREw LUsk with his pretty
childish ways and his quite
touching entreaty for informa-
tion. Sir ANDREW is always
“wanting to know, you know.”
Particularly anxious to-night
to ascertain full details about
some spirits which are stored
for scientific purposes in the
neighbourhood of the Depart-
ment of Science and Art at
South Kensington.
“What sort of spirits are
they?” Sir ANDREW plaintively
asks, indicating by a subtle
drooping of the left corner of
his mouth a preference for
Scotch whiskey. When it was -
explained that the spirits were taken outwardly by reptiles and
º: ºgreeable phenomena, Sir ANDREw was quiet for the rest of
e night. - - -
“Never heard of such a thing in my life!” he said, in a hushed
whisper, as he walked out. “41,700 for a new building to kee
reptiles in spirits, whilst there's many a man at the East end o
London—” - - - - - -
But he was gone. Begins to think he will curb his curiosity, since
it may spring upon him such fearful disclosures of wilful waste.
Business #.”. voted in Supply.
Merry Andrew.
Friday.—Mr. W. FowlFR, discussing the law of entail by the
light of the electric lamp, shows how regardless a Radical House of
Commons is of the dramatic proprieties. Subject would have been
better treated, methinks, if the House had been lit up with tallow
candles, or, at best, with oil-lamps. As it, was, twelve squares of
glass flashed electric radiance on the pleased,Member for Cambridge
as he related to a limited but inte-
rested audience how he had drawn up
marriage-settlements where fortunes
of £100,000 were involved. These
reminiscences lent a touching inte-
rest to the story. But perhaps the
chief hit was where Mr. Fowler
referred to the case of “a man with
six or seven thousands a year and as
many children.” House roared, and
Mr. FowleR testily explained that
“what he meant was that the man
had as many children as he had thou-
sands,” which made the meaning a
little clearer, though not pellucid.
Now we have the electric light,
science must really go a little further,
and give us machinery by which water
can be laid on the premises and drawn
at will. Am told the piping bullfinch -
is able to draw its own water. Why should the piping Member of
Parliament have to go in search of a tumblerful in remote recesses of
the House? This necessity brought about sudden collapse of debate.
ARTHUR ARNOLD having spoken on every topic coming before the
House, besides having a question or two, began to feel the need of
refreshment before undertaking to instruct the House on the Law
of Settlement. Sent PAssMoRE Edwards for the water, and began
what promised to be an instructive and interesting lecture. Some
one noting this preparation, and feeling he really could not stand
any more of ARTHUR in the current week, moved that the House
be counted, and counted it was–out.
Business done.—More votes in Supply.

New Warsion, and that, folks say, is a bit hard to understand.

this case. You say you know that this girl's mother has been ill for

School-Board Officer. But the girl is quite well herself. The law
says that sickness shall be a valid excuse for non-attendance, but
that must mean the sickness of the child.

Flanigan. Look here, yeer Honor, I don't want to be hard on the
gintleman, but if he'll purvide a housekeeper to take my daater's

GIVE US ROOM!
THE years roll by, and the population increases.
London grows half-a-million bodies every ten years—
people with stagnant souls and puny spirits, who are
content, #. to a certain point, to take things as they find
them. The greatest city in the world has the finest
cross-roads from East to West or West to East that any
centre of civilisation can boast of, but when we look to
its thoroughfares from North to South, or South to North,
we find them in the same state as in the bag-wig and
square-cut-coat time—the days of the Four Georges.
From the Royal Exchange to Hyde Park Corner there is
not a clear, wide, unbroken thoroughfare that is worthy
of the name which brings the high grounds of Surrey
into communication with the high grounds of Middlesex.”
Obstructive Dukes, City Companies, Wested Interests,
Pºis Inertia, Divided Authority, Parochial Jobbery,
Jackass-Worship, Poco-Curantism, and a variety of
other causes explain this toleration of No Thoroughfare.
Landlords support tenants, and tenants support land-
lords in maintaining little centres of monastic seclusion
in the very centre of London, and stopping the free
passage of goods and men from one side of the great city
to the other. There are only two solutions of this diffi-
culty-one peaceable, the other inevitable—a Parliamen-
tary Committee, by which compensation is given for
rights destroyed—a H. le recognised when the first
ilway was driven through the lands of reluctant land-
owners; or the rough and less legal proceedings of the
Welsh Rebeccaites.
London with its four millions of people, and the coming
paralysis of traffic, cannot remain as they are, and the
sooner these facts are recognised by Bumbledom and
Officialism the better.

TRAPS TO CATCH COCKNEYS.
THE summer has now commenced, and with it the usual—perhaps
more than usual flood of country paradises which are offered to the
panting Cockney.
Proprietors and house-agents combine to paint the lily and adorn
the rose. Gushing advertisements appeal to that love of nature
which the Londoner either has, or fancies he has, from the middle of
May to the end of August. º tenements are run up in square
patches of stony garden, and offered to him as “replete with every
modern convenience,” or old houses deserted by everything but rats,
are offered to him as “hallowed by historical associations.” . A rank
field is described as a “paddock”—a mangy grass-plot is dignified
with the name of “lawn,” a * and foetid pond suggests “fish-
ing,” an ague-breathing marsh is softened by “wild duck shooting,”
and any distance within four miles of the sea, gives the right to the
title of “sea-side residence.” The dulness of stupidity or decay is
described as “quiet retirement and seclusion; ” a run of faded gravel
and stones with a side view of a pig-stye and a water-butt, is called
a “carriage-drive,” and anything in the shape of a wilderness is
called a “shrubbery.” The word “acre” in these advertisements
is an elasticº that means anything or nothing, and any sheds
are described as “coach-house, stable, &c.” The soil is always
“gravel,” the situation “salubrious; ” the station is always within
a "few minutes” of the house, and the trains are always “frequent.”
After the unfortunate Cockney has spent a week and several pounds in
“viewing” these eligible Edens, he generally comes to the conclusion
that § is not a lost art, and that London is not quite such an
unbearable place as the first rays of sunlight had led him to imagine.

DRAMATIC AND OPERATIC.
MANY people say that “Bard's the best”—in German. Many
people are welcome to their opinion since Providence made him
an Englishman. As Mr. W. S. GILBERT in an inspired moment
wrote—

won't risk it)—a Russian,
Or an I-ta-li-an;

commonplace. Nobody acted particularly well; and the comic
character Autolycus—who was such a difficulty in evidence during

was of the clown and pantaloon order.
The idyllic portion of the play is delightful, and there is a babble

“THE FORMS OF THE HOUSE.”
(By Electric Light.)
MoMDAY, June 13.−Pretty bit of eomedy between Mr. PARNELL
and Mr. BIGGAR. Latter had on the paper an Amendment to the
Land Bill. Moved it in due course and a luminous speech. Some-
thing about subdividing farms, and, as the PREMIER gently†.
out, had been already debated through one or two nights. That, of
course, was a matter of no consequence to Joseph G.ILL.Is. In fact,
it added something to the charm of the undertaking. When PREMIER
down, PARNELL up, and ceremoniously alluding to J. B. as “my
hon. friend,” besought him in the interests of the Bill, and with the
object of expediting its progress, not to persist in his Amendment.
Perfectly de j to see JoEY B.'s sternly judicial air whilst lis-
tening to his friend's appeal. In his ingenuous countenance one
could behold the reflection of the struggle going on in his breast. On
one side were the interests of his country as represented by prevent-
ing the House of Commons doing * work. "On the other was the
appeal of his leader. Of course, the little scene had been *
beforehand. But what true artist allows his representation of a
character to suffer because he has attended rehearsals P. When
PARNELL resumed his seat, having played his part very well, Joseph
GILLIS rose, and with his thumb in the capacious arm-pit of his
waistcoat, gently chid his hon. friend for putting him in the dilemma
where duty combated personal inclination. He “differed from his
hon. friend,” he said, and stated his reasons at length. But it was
not for him to stand up against his leader. Therefore he would
withdraw his Amendment; which, with a stately wave of the hand,
he instructed “Mr. PLAYFAIR, Sir,” to do.
Later in the sitting an attempt to imitate this perfect scene was
made with ToM Collins in the place of Mr. PARNELL, and Lord
RANDoLPH CHURCHILL in the rôle of Mr. BIGGAR. ToM is pretty
well, there being a rugged honesty in the cut of his trowsers, an
unimpeachable integrity in the fit of his “Bluchers.” But RAN-
Dolph is not to be compared, in this character, with Joseph G.ILL.Is.
He lacks the fine air of .# the situation from the very first
grasp. Nor has he the gift which J. º the highest degree,
of delicately shading off his various duties of being, genial towards
his hon. friend, snubbing the PRIME MINISTER and terrifying the
Chairman of Committees.
Business done.—Land Bill considered in Committee.
Tuesday.—There has, it appears, been a great wave of interest at
Frome, impetuously rushing forward with desire to hear Mr. HENRY
SAMUELSON's views on the Liquor Traffic. Am bound to say the
feeling is not shared to any maddening extent by the House. But
this is a mere trifle, easily explicable. Mr. SAMUELsoN knows very
well all about it. He is aware of the tendency in the human breast
to be envious of young and gi men who come prominently to the
front at political crises, and sway the multitude at Frome and other
busy centres of civilisation.
º: SAMUELsoN by no means, anxious to make a speech, But
private inclination must yield to public duty. Accordingly he
temporarily dispossesses M. DILWYN of the corner-seat below the
Gangway, whilst he states his views before a hushed senate. º:
he might have managed to º: from whatever place he usually
occupies. But on an occasion like this, with Frome anxious and the
solar system disturbed, it is necessary that he should occupy a promi-
ment position in the House, and there is none better than the seat for
which the late Mr. Roebuck used to struggle with the Member for
Swansea.
Spoke for a long time with easy grace and self-possession. Opened
his heart to the House; showed how laboriously he had thought out
the question. Most anxious that the listening world and the dislo-
cated solar system should not misunderstand the precise length, to
which he was able to go in support of the happy and highly-
favoured Baronet in charge of the Resolution. Every opportunity
afforded the House of comprehending his views. But not for the
first time in history Wisdom cried aloud in the streets, and none
listened. A cheerful group of country gentlemen in the neighbour-
hood of Sir WALTER BARTTELOT listened only to jeer. When Mr.
SAMUELsoN related how he and “a friend” i. driven two miles
out of London, and had been struck with the number of public-
houses on the way, ribald references were audibly drawn; and when
he went on to state, with accustomed detail, that at any given place
on the road they “could see three or four public-houses at the same
time,” some one asked in a stage-whisper whether this was towards
the end of the journey P
The coarse suggestion which underlay this question, and the
fancy picture of this able young man driving for a day out, droppin
in with a “friend” into public-houses on the way, and at the en
of a two miles' drive seeing double or treble, was much enjoyed by
middle-aged gentlemen who ought to have known better.
Business done.—Local Option carried by 196 votes against 154.
Wednesday.—Sir WILFRID LAwson, moving last night his Local
Qption Resolution, made only one joke, and that, in the opinion of
the House, halted, in the last syllable. Speaking of Mr. WARTon
and his friendly habit of indiscriminately “blocking’”. Bills, Sir
WILFRID said he was “thełºś. blocker of the age.” ferhaps
there was a slight, accidental halting over the last syllable of #.
word. But when Members opposite inquiringly said “Blockhead”?
Sir WILFRID answered, “No, no, you know what I mean—blocker.”
WARTON not j". at this joke. Seems to have heard of it since
and a usually placid temper is disturbed. Comes down to-day an
looses off his “accumulated thought” on the Welsh Sunday Closing
Bill. His thought a trifle turgid, and his delivery a little loud.
Runs Alderman Fowler very close in the matter of volume of voice.
Now denounces at top of it people who prefer water themselves and
object to others drinking whiskey. Only if Mr. WARToN could say
all this without raising his voice as # he were stranded by St.
Thomas's Hospital and were addressing the House on the other side
of the River, it would be a personal convenience to those near him.
Business done:Patents Bill passed.
Thursday Night.—It's all very well for people to shoot out the
lip and wink the eye at RANDOLPH because he sent a friend to Lord
ARTINGTON with (as malicious people say) as certain assurance
of getting a safe answer as if he had conveyed a cartel to the Monu-
ment. But see how it works to-night. meone having moved to
report º at midnight, RANDOLPH rose and in really bland
terms-' the most courteous way I could,” as he subsequently de-
scribed his interposition-supported the Motion. The PREMIER, in
; turned a little rough on RANDoIPH, perhaps for the first
time in his life without provocation. The fact is, Mr. WARTon had
a few minutes earlier been º: the House at the PREMIER,
whose eye, when he rose, accidentally lighting upon the submissive
figure of RANDoIPH, he instinctively fell upon him and rended him,
upon the principle that if he didn't deserve it now he had a short time
ago, or would presently. Almost with tears in his eyes, RANDoLPH
protested against this taunt, which he truly said he had not deserved.
There the matter might seem to rest. But a significant movement

on the part of the O'Gorman MAHoN towards the neigh-
bourhood of RANDoIPH suggested ulterior consequences.
The O'MAHoN deeply resents the preference shown to
Captain O'SHEA.
*If there is business about, I'm the boy,” he says.
“I was out t times before ºsmºs was bºrn.”
Perhaps the PREMIER's quick eye noted all this. Whe-
ther or not, when House cleared for Division, he hastily
crossed over, explained to RANDoIPH that it was all a
mistake, an ged him to think no more of it.
Pretty to see the group—the PREMIER explaining with
animation,

deference and doubt, and in º the O'MAhon

within his reach, suddenly and unexpectedly withdrawn.
Business done.-Clause One of Land Bill -
Friday.--Something serious will have to be done shortly
with Mr. WAR Fox. His natural sense of humour was
not originally fine, and by too frequent flashing is apt
to grow monotonous. It consists wholly of interrupting
ers by bellowing (the word is parliamentary)—
‘Bear.’ hear!”)—at incongruous moments. The
quse, *::::A; death of the incessant buzz of its own
volce, * § leaps at opportunity, for laughter:
as the
Whilst it keenest eye for true humour, it will
laugh loudly atjests that in ordinary conversation would
be met with a polite stare of inquiry. It must always
have someone in cap and bells. . WARton, uncon-
sciously at first, was an early candidate for the office, and
it was promptly bestowed upon him. The only funny
thing about Mr. WARton was his unconsciousness. Now
that he has set up as a professional humorist he has
become unbearable, Loud invoice, boisterous in manner,
and of dullestintelligence, he, being hitherto unchecked,
frequently succeeds in bringing the House of Commons
momentarily downto his own level.
Honourable Gentlemen near him are º respon-
sible for this. It is not a rôle they would like to under-
take themselves. But since it annoys Mr. GLADSTONE,
and occasionally brings about disorder to the detriment
of business, they º on the Member for Bridport; and
it is not altogether his fault if he is beginning to assume
the position of the representative of the Conservative
Party. Mr. WART.on was at best a poor joke. He is
now played out, and, for the credit of the House, should
be snuffed out.
Business done.—Clause Two of Land Bill passed.
“RATIONAL DRESS.”
[A “Rational Dress Society” has been formed under the
Presidency of Wiscountess HARBERTon, which recommends the
adoption of a “dual garmenture,” or “divided skirt,” exactly
like the old Bloomer costume.]
NoTHING succeeds like a little variety,
Nº. still is the craze of the day;
Here is the latest, the newest Society,
Bidding folks dress in a sensible way.
Formed upon principles quite international,
Wiscountess HARBERTON taking the Chair;
Dress, it declares, must henceforward be rational,
What then are Ladies in future to wear?
Surely reform comes with too much velocity,
Bloomers, it seems, are to startle again;
Skirts be divided, Oh, what an atrocity
To “dual garmenture” folks must attain.
True that another skirt hides this insanity
Miss MARY WALKER in old days began;
Yet it should flatter our masculine vanit
For this means simply the trowsers of Man!
Very Likely.
THE evening of the Grand Prix the elated Americans
| in Paris wanted to revive the sort of row at Mabille that
used to take place every Derby Night at Cremorne. The
name “Foxhall” was so suggestive of the ancient Royal
Property, the Thousand Additional Lamps, and of Cre-
morne. The evening, however, passed 5ft respectably
enough, the American, division contenting themselves
with chorusing a French-Italian adaptation of the tenor
song in Rigoletto—
“La Donna a Mabille.”
And so home to enjoy “ that sweet repose which inno-

good and honest friends the Bondholders. He has determined to
make many concessions. He will chat the matter quietly over with
§. Further, to England he will give the security of Cyprus;
to France, Tunis; to Austria, Bosnia; and to Russia, Merv. These
guarantees are a proof (if one is needed) of the good faith that will
characterise for the future the dealings between the Sublime Porte
and all foreigners. The SULTAN, moreover, has determined to order
the Khedive of EGYPT to pay any sums of money that henceforward
may be advanced to His Imperial Majesty. -
In conclusion, in return for all these valuable concessions, the
SyſtAN, would ask the same civilised world to advance, on His
Majesty's personal security (and the SULTAN's word is as good as his
bond—if not, indeed, better), the unimportant amount of half-a-dozen

THE Scotch, very naturally, are beginning to be jealous of the

first instalment, for a responsible Minister. The demand, eoming
from the Earl of FIFE, is put as gently as possible to a Ministry who
are hopelessly involved in the toils of Irish, Legislation, but backed,
as it is, by strong, national feeling, it will be urged by less eon-
siderate advocates before many Sessions have passed. It will have
to be conceded, and why not face it at once?

THE WORMS HAVE
TURNED.
THE chief art of Govern-
ment is to do nothing with an
air of doing much. The best
administrators are those who
have thoroughly mastered the
axiom that zeal is a crime, and
who are clever at sitting upon
troublesome questions. n-
fortunately there are questions
that will not be sat upon, and
the §. of the Tº
Clerks is one of them. The Go-
vernment have “considered”
this grievance so long and so
dreamily, that at last the dis-
contented Clerks have threat-
ened to strike. They may not
at present have the organisa-
tion and the command of funds
of the “working-man,” who
is always on the verge of
striking, but these will come
in the fulness of time. The
Government have roused a
spirit of self-reliance in these
over-worked and under-paid
servants of a money-grubbing
department, which no tardy
concessions can destroy. The
patronising, not to say fatherly
articles in some of the news-
papers will encourage this
spirit, for under the tone of
warning is an ill-concealed
fear that skilful telegraphists
are not to be obtained from
the fields and gutters. How
much better it would have
been to have “considered”
less and acted more, and have
yielded gracefully.

THE MUDFORD FLOWER-
SHOW.
THIs great open-air exhi-
bition is now on view two or
three times a week in Central
London. It extends from
Oxford Street to the Water-
loo Road in one direction, and
from Charing Cross to the
Griffin in another. The so-
called Flower Market in
Covent Garden is used as a
rallying centre, a source of
supply for everything except
the patient donkey, the im-
patient costermonger, and the
curious collection of carts and
trucks which mix up the
country with Bethnal j
the London cab and the cars o
Juggernaut, PICKFORD & Co.
The flowers are things of
beauty, and, under different
circumstances, would be joys
for ever, but the language of
those who buy and sell these
ifts of Nature is not as pure as
it ought to be, considering the
refinement of their trade.
One, and perhaps the princi
cause of this, is the crowded
area in which the business is
carried on, and the never-
ceasing struggle with London
traffic. The person primarily
responsible for thisis, of course,
the Most Noble the Baron

tion on the obvious advantages of “spirited reciprocity”). Yes, as I
was saying, the only way to pay these rascals out is to let them have

can't sell as many knives as he desires abroad, he B.-in Pall
Mall—should be su ly called on to pay nineteen and sixpence a

it's quite sound in principle-quite sound; and, as you very aptly
put it, “paying them back in their own coin,”—impost for impost,
—is the proper remedy. (Unconsciously tasting his Claret, and

MAKING THE WERY MOST OF IT.
THE agricultural festivities at Tunbridge Wells, having been dis-
Wººl of quite a fortnight since, the visit of H.R.H.. the Prince of
ALEs to that salubrious locality has necessarily been by this time
consigned to the limbo of all remarkable but forgotten things. But
there is one incident that, even at this hour, Mr. Punch would
rescue from oblivion. It appears that some arrangement had been
entered into by the Local Board with a resident flyman, to supply
them “niceturns-out” for the occasion, at the rate of “three guineas
per carriage and pair,” a figure the amount of which led to some
extremely business-like discussion, and a report of this was subse:
}. urnished in the columns of a local paper. But Mr. Punch
eels he must give the subjoined extract, pur et simple, as it stands.
“Mr. Robb thought that three guineas was a very tremendous price for a
couple of horses and a fly. -
“Mr. SMITH said he quite agreed with Mr. Robb.
“Mr. Robb thought º Biggs, as a business man, should have known
better than make such an arrangement. -
“The ChairMAN said Mr. Hoadley attended before the Committee, and
explained that there would be such a run on carriages that day that he could
not really do it at a lower price. -
“Mr. Robb : Well, I suppose we can have a ride afterwards.
“Mr. Clifford: We ought to have something better than the usual fly,
and good horses to keep up with His Royal Highness, whose general custom is
to drive from ten to twelve miles an hour. -
“The CHAIRMAN: We shall be in front, and shall regulate his pace.
“Mr. Rope. I am perfectly satisfied. On the first blush it looked heavy.”
To which Mr. Punch must add that, on the last blush, it certainly
reads funny. Mr. Robb's idea of º outing somewhereafter-
wards, is good—very. Better still are Mr. CLIFFoRD's statistics as
to His Royal Highness's “general custom.” But best of all is the
- s.sly suggestion as to the advantage of being “in frºnt”
of him with a couple of hired hacks. This is absolutely excellent.

A SONG FOR SINGERS,
(A Lay of the Concert Season.)
WHo says that we are not a musical nation,
With afternoon Concerts and singing at night,
When auditors listen in rapt admiration
To RUBENSTEIN's playing, or hear with delight
CHARLEs HALLE's Recitals, Bach Concerts, and wonder
At fast-flying fingers that flash o'er the keys;
While shortly we're promised Wagnerian thunder,
The beauty of which we shall learn by degrees.
A Concert, methinks, should be just like a salad,
Well mixed, the ingredients chosen with care;
A solo, a pretty duet, and a ballad,
A novelty, too, should be certainly there.
Though masters of old still exist to admonish
The student how vast are the heights he must scale;
Some modern Composer may try to astonish—
And Hope, as we know, tells a flattering tale.
With SANTLEY, and REEVEs père et fils, and Miss DAVIEs,
And MAYBRICK and LLoyd-to come back to the men;
With fair Mrs. OsgooD, who sings like the mavis,
With ANToINETTE STERLING aud clever Hope GLENN;
There's no lack of singers with musical voices,
Who oft a new charm to old songs can impart:
And England be sure in their talent rejoices,
And welcomes all Artists, and honours their Art.
Sporting, Note:-There is a rush to engage ARCHER, the Jockey,
because he has such winning ways with him.

only got one picture in this show. It is
No. 113 in the book, and is called A

is evident, it is not the “old woman,”
but the “young lady clothed in grey,”
and might be some sort of weird, poe-
tical, imaginative advertisement for
JAY's celebrated establishment, to be
called “Early Morning.” But where's

we ever loved was Herr Won JöEL in the

Savage breast), he waves languidly the Union Jack. When he has
had enough of the tune (and he seldom listens to more than half-a-
dozen bars), he shakes the same flag with violent irritability. The
result of the manoeuvre, from a musical point of view, is a certain
amount of jerkiness. Near to the Master of the Ring stands, or
rather dances, a volunteer officer in grey mufti, who, by his mirth-
provoking antics (apparently necessitated by his duties as a judge),
amply supplies the broad comedy usually associated with the motley
of, a Circus clown. The competitors, on ### a prize, kindly
ride rºund the arena to receive the plaudits of the bystanders. .
Such was the scene in the Agricultural Hall when I visited it last
week. As I entered, two mounted gentlemen wearing leather
jackets and huge iron masks, and carrying heavy sticks, were wait-
ing for the word of command. The Master of the Ring introduced
them to the audience. “Riding-Master So-and-so of the Royal So-
and-So-Red, Lieutenant Somebody-Else of the Dark Thingumies
-Yellow, Gentlemen, are you ready ?”. The answer being appa-
Fºſtly in the affirmative, the Master raised his right hand slightly, as
if inviting to the dance,” and murmured, “Left-turn-counter:
march,” as if he were piloting an awkward squad of distinguished
cers through the last figure of a new quadrille. The horses
trotted away to the ends of the arena, and turned round. “”Tack,”
continued #. Master in the same gently persuasive tone. Upon this
he two equestrians approached one another ferociously, and with
3 utmost heartiness whacked each other for about three minutes.
After they had received considerable “punishment” they desisted.
Brush!” shouted the gentleman in the patrol-jacket, in a tone that
would havemade tyrantstremble, and two privatesimmediately sprung
at the combatants, and removed the chaik-marks which the sticks
had left on their bodies. The gentleman in grey mufti (who had
taken off his hat so as to see the fight º: with another
judge, and then they both nodded to the Ring-Master. “One to
Redſ.” said he, entering something in a book; and there was great
cheering. So far as I could make out, in actual warfare the sword-
ºuts would have reduced the opponents to pieces considerably thinner
than ordinary slices of brown bread-and-butter. At the amiable
invitation of the Ring-Master the whacking was frequently repeated.
After we had assisted at several bouts between new competitors,
the swordsmen appeared to have had enough of it, and their places

consented to show us the relative value of a stick and a pole as aids
to argument in settling a matter under heated discussion. The
Ring-Master was courteous to the competitors, but harsh to his
smart, assistants. “Chalk!” he shouted; and a small regiment flew
to whiten the head of the pole and the side of the stick. Then the
voice of thunder once more gave way to the tones of the dove as he
introduced the competitors to the audience. “So-and-So' again was
“Red,” and “Somebody Else” was once more “Yellow.” “Gentle-
men, are you ready?, Left turn—countermarch, "Tack!” The riders
approached one another, the gentleman with the pole trying to prod
his opponent heavily in the body, while the gentleman with the
sword attempted to whack his companion soundly across the head.
The horses in this competition seemed to take great interest, as they
occasionally came in for a share of the glory in the shape of blows.
And now was the º: opportunity of the gentleman in grey
mufti. Unarmed, and bare-headed, he danced about in the midst
of the fray with a bravery and an energy that filled the audience
with apprehension and astonishment. Now he was within an ace of
receiying a nasty prod, now he only just escaped a sounding thwack,
now he was actually under the horses' hoofs. But he seemed to bear
a charmed life; and in spite of all his daring he never once gave
occasion to the Ring-Master to cry, “One for the Grey !”
After the practice with the “Sword versus Lance (Mounted),” the
interest subsided. The programme promised “Tent Pegging” and
“Tilting at the Ring,” and these distractions were supplied. Until
now the competitórs had been exclusively cavalry men, but at this
point, an infantry officer joined the lists. This was a welcome
addition to the troupe, as the gentleman in grey mufti on the appear-
ance of the new-comers had ceased to take a very active part in the
sports of the day. The º, officer was †† a riding-master
would possibly have called “a slightly footy gentleman.” He had
º come to the conclusion that the easiest way of picking up
al . with a lance at full º was to work his legs from j to
side after the model of one of those amusing cardboard figures that
raise their limbs on the pulling of a string. The “Exercise” was
uaint and unconventional, but did not appear to materially assist
the rider in attaining his object. . It may be ºteºly added that
his powers of invention seemed to be considerable. For instance, on
returning once after making his-alas!—too usual miss, he appeared
to be dancing (on horseback) a kind of Chinese fandango.
Towards the close of the programme there were some long pauses,
which enabled the band to get through nearly half an overturé
before the angry shaking of the Union Jack waved them back into
snubbed silence. At last some lemons were duly sliced (a parently
in mimic imitation of the Battle of Balaclava), a Turk's head was

GOOD NEWS FOR US ALL |
AN old proverb tells us that when a certain class of persons fall
out, another class of persons get their rights. It is therefore very
good news for hungry Londoners to learn, as they do from the
Citizen, that certain Salesmen of the various City Markets are quar-
relling in the most glorious manner.
It appears that the Chairman of the Markets Committee of the
Corporation is a Fruit Salesman, and, for reasons best known to
himself, bitterly opposed the Billingsgate Fish Market inquiry; but
it being resolved upon in spite of him, he, in a fit of anger and
pique, gave notice, that the inquiry should be extended to ascertain-
ing the reason of the high price of Meat, whereupon a Meat Salesman
gave notice to include in the inquiry Fruit and Vegetables 1
So, thanks to the good feeling that originated the i. why
Fish is so scarce and so dear, and the bad feeling that extends the
inquiry to Meat and Fruit and Wegetables, we may fairly hope the
whole matter of the Food Supply of the Metropolis will be thoroughly
and heartily inquired into.
When we remember, too, what was stated by one Common Coun-
cilman as a rumour, and confirmed } another Common Councilman
as a fact, that the concentration of the Meat Supply of the Metro-
polis into one market raised the price twopence #. pound upon the
220,000 tons that enter that market yearly, which means an increase
of cost to the inhabitants of the Metropolis of more than four mil-
lions sterling per annum; it will be seen what gigantic proportions
the new inquiry is attaining.
Upon this Mr. Punch ventures to remark that whereas on the one
hand it is almost impossible to hold up to sufficient contempt the
man who enters public life solely to serve his own private interests,
so, on the other hand, no one deserves more thoroughly the respect
and support of his fellows than he who devotes very much of his
time .all his intelligence to an endeavour to cheapen the food of
the poor. The new Committee, therefore, must not be daunted by
what may be a subtle attempt to overweight them, but proceed to a
thorough inquiry, feeling assured, as they may fairly do, that their
labours will watched with sympathy and will by all whose
goodwill is worth obtaining. . Mr. Punch also hopes the inquiry
will be a public one.
PAROCHIAL PRODIGALS.
By accounts from Oldham it . that the Poor Law Guardians
there have received whatevery orthodox believer in Political Econom
must consider a merited snub from the Official Auditor of the #.
Government Board. In auditing their accounts he disallowed a sum
of some £9. This expense had been incurred for flower-vases, which
the Guardians said they had provided because they desired “to
relieve the dingy appearance of the place.” Ah! . They did not
know their duty, which, of course, was to relieve, not the din
appearance of the workhouse, but the pockets of the ratepayers, by
reducing parochial relief to a minimum.
Rebuking their unprincipled, not to say sinful extravagance, the
faithful official of the Local Government informed those unbelieving
spendthrifts that “flowers were not necessary for the relief of the
r; and the rates could only be applied in the relief of distress.”
Éº to the root of the matter. ad he merely demurred to a
ayment of £9 for flower-vases, on the ground that flower-pots would
º done as well, and that poor's-rates were not meant to be
squandered on blue china, he would have said less, than enough.
But he proved equal to the occasion. His point was that flowers are
a superfluity which, the inmates of a workhouse º; not to be
allowed. Because the only relief of distress proper for paupers is
such as will just suffice to keep body and soul together. . It is mon-
strous to think of relieving the dingy appearance of their surround-

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
EXTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Mºwbay. June 20.-Why won't the House let Mr. MoRGAN LLoyd
speak to it? I’m sure he is a very nice gentleman, and must be
learned, since he is a Q. C. But sure as ever the sound of his voice
is heard, everybody says, “Oh!” and “Agreed!” Perhaps his
voice is a little reedy, and there is
something about his accent reminis-
cent of an Eisteddfod. This is Mr.
GLADstone's notion.
“Ever been at an Eisteddfod,
ToBY } " he said, when, having
watched Sir CHARLEs ForstER out
of the way, I dropped in on the
Treasury Bench for a bit of a chat;
“I was once; and the moment I hear
MoRGAN LLoyd, there comes back
to me a smell of damp, people, and
a sense of the rain º through
holes in a canvas tent. It always
rains at an Eisteddfod, you know.
I see a bard reciting an englynion,
and I have a presentiment that there
will be a row presently when the
prizes come to be distributed. Curi-
ous, these associations of memory
always happen when I hear Morgas
Lloyd.”
This is all very well for GLAD-
- ston E, who can go through any-
thing. But as avery small per-centage of surviving Members can have
been at an Eisteddfod, that doesn't account for the general move-
ment. I think it must be the lawyers and Q. C.’s, angry because
MoR&AN has been made as good as them, whilst the stuff-gowns are
envious for lack of MoRe AN's silk.
Business done.-Clause Three of Land Bill passed.
Tuesday Night.-Looked in at the House of Lords to-night to see
my Lord of SALISBURY balancing himself on the tight-ro Really
a performance of exquisite skill and stately grace. Don't know
much about Imperial politics myself. But understand generall
that the Marquis is rather in a mess on this Tunis business. It
was to come again, to-night, and how would he deal with it?. My
Lord preternaturally grave, even subdued, under the weight of
patriotic apprehension for the fortunes of the Ministry, and the
safety of national interests. Now, as on previous occasion, ignored
with nonchalance the circumstance of his conversation with
M. WADDINGTON, and subsequent letters. Did not treat that part
of the subject even by most distant
reference. But since he had therein
distinctly declared that British interests
were not affected by French greed of
Tunis, he now threw the aegis of his
protection and approval round the
Government “up to a certain point.”
The certain point reached, Lord
SALISBURY's gloom deepened, and the
solemn shaking of the head made the
blood run cold. There was nothing in
his secret treaty with M. WADDINgtoN
about the appointment of M. RoustAN
as Foreign Minister of the BEY. If
such a thing had been proposed, of
course Lord SALISBURY would have
exclaimed “Perish Cyprus!” and would
have withdrawn from his bargain at
Berlin. This was the certain point;
and the portentous manner in which
Lord SALisbury, leaning his elbow on
the table, and shaking his head over
the unconscious inkbottle, gradually
brought this to the front, leaving the - -
rest farther and farther in the background, was highly creditable tº
him. Noble Lords, who had formerly been led to think rather well
of Lord GRANVILLE, began to look upon him with suspicion. He had
been right up to a certain point; why had he not stopped there?
When Lord SALISBURY resumed his seat, crossed his hands at the
wrists, º his head a little on one side, the usually hard ex-
ression on his face softened, and something like a tear gathered in
is eyes. He was truly sorry for the Government. He would be
so glad if he could continue to fº. them the undivided º:
vouchsafed in the speech by which he broke the long silence follºw-
ing the unfortunate discovery of his last secret treaty. But this

collection of the heads of the people opposite and below

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. 309
“IL DEMONIO;” OR, THE D– AFTER TAMARA.
Il Demonio, dull opera, music by RUBINSTEIN, brilliant English
translation of Libretto by our own PITTMAN,
ACTI—ScFNE 1-A Wild Place (of course we quote throughout
the PITTMAN stage-directions).-At right a huge rock advancing with
practicable summit. We've got no doubt it was there, but we didn't
see it “advancing with its practicable summit.” By the way, we
regretted to, observe that, the Poet's stage-directions seemed to be
ñº. disregarded. “Frequent flashes of lightning show
the Demon crossing slowly at the ...} of the stage from left to right.”
The frequent flashes, however, only showed a stºut person in black
on a wire descending from Right to Left–which perverse ignoring
of a clear plain-flying order must have riled the Poet considerably.
A “General chorus of created things” is decidedly noisy, as might
have been expected. The Evil Spirits wind up § {}! Demon,
* tarry P”—which sounds rather Scotch.
he Demon—a respectable person, not unlike Hamlet without the
hat and feathers—“seats himself on the edge of the advancing rock
at the right,” says PITTMAN, imperiously; ºt as a matter of fact,
the Demon stands bolt upright on the stage-left, roundly abusin
the World, with which, up to this time, we had always #. 2
Demonio was on peculiarly friendly terms—but perhaps Mr. PITTMAN
has had a hand in the “Revised Version,”—and winds up with–
“'Tis dull, indeed, insane and void,
Thy meanless boast that end hath never!”
Then, from a hole in a rock below, out pops Mme. TREBELLI as an
#. of Light, though looking anything but a light angel, in
full feather as far as wings go, and after a musical argument with
Sº --- s
Rubinstein carried away by Il Demonio, while the Economical Angel won't
even take a fly to follow him.
Il Demonio, in which the Angel gets decidedly the worst of it, both
disappear, and we come to Tableau II., when we see “Tamara's
playmates” descending the rock from the castle.
. The “Playmates,” consisting of a party of forty or fifty well-
matured but skittish Caucasian spinsters whose united ages amount
tº something over a thousand, sing a rather melancholy-playful
chorus till Tamara (Mdme. ALBANI) appears with her “Governess,”
a well-preserved person, who still adheres to the style of doing the
ir which may be found by the curious in such matters to have been
popular in the Keepsake Annual and the Books of Beauty of half a
century ago. The Demon appears, and falls in love with Tamara.
The Governess tries to rouse her with a weak-minded song—of a
somewhat Gregorian character—about a “Dauntless” Cavalier, whose
“Bridle and saddle are stud with rare gems.”
How can a “bridle and saddle” be “a stud”? But this is poetic-
Pittmanic licence;—
“Golden the bit is the charger that stems.”
, Ah! our head still aches with trying to discover the Poet's mean-
ing. It is indeed a golden bit from the poetic treasury ! The Demon
es love to Tamara from the top of a rock in a dreary field-
preaching sort of way. As Il Demonio is really out for a lark, his
sombre costume is a mistake. He ought to have been “In his
Sunday best,” when “His jacket was red and his breeches were
blue,” with the arrangement for “carrying his tail” deseribed by
CoLERIDGE. Before its repetition at Covent Garden, Signor TAG-
LIAFICO and the costumiers might arrange this; and don't let them
forget, a good moving tail. ere must be one in the house, left
behind by one of the Imps in last year's Pantomime.
‘TABLEAU III, Wild Rocky Pass in the Mountains of the
Caucasus.”—“Old Servant” in a furry white hat, suggestive of his
having become fraudulently possessed of a Caucasian donkey, accom-
panies the Prince of Sinodal, and sings to him too, for the matter
of that. The Prince arrives on horseback, more a Circussian than
a Caucasian ; he also
evinces a melancholy
taste for infusing a little
Gregorian tone in his
love-songs. He is on his
way to marry Tamara,
when the Demon incites
the Tartars to fall on the
whole lot, who, after a
“twopence - coloured ''
hand-to-hand combat,
are all slain with the
exception of the Old Ser-
vant. So, much for the
Prince of Sinodal, who
has had a short operatic
- life, and not apparently
** a very merry one.
ACT II.-The Play-
mates again. Bridegroom
expected. Rejoicings,
consisting of heavy chorus and stupidly wearisome national danges.
Old Servant arrives with the melancholy intelligence, and foreseeing
that his reputation for honesty must be somewhat shy on account of
that white hat tradition, he brings the body of the Prince as evidence
of his veracity. - -
The human Love interest, such as it is, being now at an end as far
as the Principals are concerned, we were glad to detect a sneaking
partiality on #. part of the Old Servant with the white hat for the
ancient &º who had once been a professional beauty. It was
clearly love at first sight; for from the moment they met until the
end of Act II, he
never left her side;
and even at the most
serious moment, when
the Court went to
prayers, Old Slyboots'
wicked old left eye
was on that ancient
Governess who was
clearly flattered and
fluttered by his atten-
tion. Nothing came
of ſit. Neither of
'em appeared again.
Perhaps they eloped
soon after the com-
mencement of Act
III, after Tamara
had retired to a con-
vent, when the last
thing we heard of the - - -
fraudulent Old Servant with the white hat was his voice “without ’’
–(they wouldn't admit him within the walls of a convent, even in
the Caucasus, not if they knew it)—singing,
“Rest ye, Christians, rest.”
And then, by way of carrying out the idea of sending all the inmates
to sleep, the stage-direction is, “He strikes the gong,” which, to say
the least of it, sounds like a practical joke of Poet PITTMAN's.
Il Demonio pretends to be converted from the error of his ways–
quite Origen-al this—and tries to induce Tamara to ºt him as a
husband. She refuses. This does make Il Demonio so wild! Then the
lamp of the Oratory flares up, the Angel with a few friends happening
to be passing by, looks in, and the ghost of Sino gets himself mixed up
with it somehow—that is, he ought to have done so according to the
strict stage-direction, but from either having some other engagement,
or from a disinglination to interfere with what no longer was any
business of his, he did not come up to time, and “ Tamara falls dead
on the ground.” Il Demonio, # ºf to the Miltonic-PITTMAN,
“sinks into the abyss.” The Demon, however, did nothing of the
kind, preferring to walk off †† Composer, Angel, and Devil
appeared before the Curtain—let us º: they supped together—and
we only regret that we saw and heard so little of Mme. TREBELLI,
though as she played an Angel, her visits were, as we might have
anticipated, few and far between.
Of course there was a great Demon-stration in favour of Il
Demonio; but the Opera is so heavy, that we found it impossible to
carry any of it away with us, and so—let us leave it as it is.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE LATEST ARRIVAL.
(By Our Own Interviewist.)
THE new Comet arrived last
Wednesday evening just in
time for the Night Fête at the
Botanical Gardens. As-
tronomer, Mr. HIND, from
head-quarters telegraphed to
a friend this characteristic
remark—“What a long tail
our Comet’s got!” Mr.
HENRY IRWING at once wanted
to engage the brilliant visitor
for a week to succeed Mr.
Booth and share the leading
business, but the Comet po-
litely refused to go in for any-
thing except the very lightest
performances. The Comet
visited the House of Commons,
and expressed himself much
interested in the Brush-light
experiment. His medical at-
tendants fear that, in conse-
quence of excessive travelling
and late hours, he is in a
gradual decline. Our Illus-
trious Guest says there are
F. more of his sort where
e comes from, but they are
being re-tailed for exporta-
tion. He evidently holds Dar-
winistic opinions, and thinks
it highly probable that Man
was originally an Ape, then
an Actor, then a Star, and will
end by becoming a Comet,
and so completing the last link
in the magnificent tail.

of these :-

time is not enough for our §: vigorous cousins. The last
one cost the country and the Tichborne family about One Hundred
Thousand pounds, and the Americans will probably undersell us, as
usual, by supplying two at the same figure. A small Company will
no doubt be formed to “run” these inflictions, who will take the
place in our newspapers of the Irish Land Bill.
