PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

MR. PUNCH entered the Cave.
“Take a rock," said Æolus, his face brightening as the radiant presence of his Visitor lighted up the gusty
recesses of his abode, “ take a rock; do—and make yourself comfortable.”
The genial Sage sat down.
"I had been hoping you might look in," continued the aged Custodian, hospitably producing an imperial pint of
bottled Boreas as he spoke; " for, to tell you the truth, though Winds is noisy company, it's dull work up here all by one-
self. There hasn't been one of 'em at home, for ever so long."
His Visitor gave a knowing nod of acquiescence.
"So I should say," he replied, "judging from the amount of blowing and blustering that has been going on outside
pretty well everywhere else of late.”
"Been as bad as that, has it?" asked Æolus, reflectively. "Well, I know they will give themselves airs ; but.
blogs you, whatever LEMPRIÈRE says about my proper business, what 's the good, I should like to know, of my keeping 'em
all boxed up here? Why, what would you do in a fog without 'em ? Smoke abatement dodges, indeed! Gammon !- that's
what I call them. Give me a stiff Sou’-Wester.”
“An excellent refresher in its way," replied MR. PUNCH, approvingly, "saving the presence of the Underwriters, who
have latterly, I fear, been singing, “Oh, blow the gentle Gales !' to some purpose. But, for the matter of that, reports
from other points of the compass are not much more exhilarating.”
"Hum!" rejoined his Host, giving a gloomy look round at the Cavern's mouth ; " how about the East ? "
“Bad at Wapping, but worse at Constantinople; and, from what I hear, likely to give a severe chill or two to some-
body in the Mediterranean before it has done its biting business. A wind that never brought good to a Britisher yet! Call
that Eastern cuss in, my venerable Custos, as soon as you like; and into your nethermost cupboard with him!"
MR. PUNCH gave a significant wink, and Toby turned his tail contemptuously in the direction of Egypt, in sign of
intelligent approval.
"Well, come, the West 's all right, anyhow. You've nothing against that ?" continued their Classic Interlocutor,
with somewhat diminished confidence.
"Ireland lies West,” replied the Sage, curtly.
“Well—South, tben ? "
"Africa—and that is big enough to hold Kroumirs and Boers; which means plenty of room for a Cyclone. You ask

all about it.”
MR. Punch rose. His Host looked puzzled.
"Hum. Anything to say against the North ?” he asked, somewhat sulkily.
“Nihil,” responded MR. PUNCH, promptly, at the same time talking a little Latin, as a graceful compliment to the
classical antecedents of his Host. “But for further particulars I must refer you to St. Petersburg."
Again TOBY set bis tail contemptuously N.E. by E. The disconcerted Guardian of the Winds looked distressed.
" Then it seems that they 're a downright ill lot, that blow nobody any good,” he said. “ Not even capable of starting
a Fair Trade wind!”
" A little impudence and a good deal of ignorance, and that breeze is soon set in motion," responded the Sage." But
if they are on the look-out for a real chance—there's a Free Trade wind that wants a bit of raising just now; and the sooner
it gets it the better. I commend that very cordially to your attention."
“It shall not be neglected," was the more cheerful reply. “A Puff? Ha! ha! I fancy I know how to contract
for that. Why, if you only knew the amount I had made out of a very popular and exalted department of Art alone, my dear
Sage and Philosopher, even you would stare. Call this the Cave of the Winds? Why, regularly every Saturday it's so full
of Theatrical Mapagers that I have to order up a dead calm, and clear it by threatening a frost.”
“Quite 80,” heartily responded the Great Visitor. “But meantime, while pegged up here, it is something, I opine,
to be able to know which way the wind blows. Would you like me to enlighten you ? "
“Rather!" said Æolus. “But how? By presenting me with an Abridged Edition of the Library of the British
Museum ? "
"That is the idea,” said Mr. Punch, at length perfectly radiant, producing at the same moment a very handsome
presentation tome from a piece of costly silver paper. "For in this book you will find something more than the condensed
wisdom of all cycles.”
“And that book is? " asked the now dancing Custos.
TOBY wagged his tail to all points of the compass. Then MR. Punch gave a final wink, and presented his-

A NEW AXE-HIBITION.
THE Gold Axe of Ashantee is
a relic of ancient glories. The
Ashantees believe it to have been
used as a battle-axe by one of
their old kings. They reverence
it as we should reverence, if
we possessed, the battle-axe of
RICHARD CEUR-DE-Lion. They
think it signifies wealth, and
symbolises courage. Their pre-
sent king accounts it a sacred em-
blem of the highest sovereignty.
Nevertheless, he is declared to
have given it up, and made a pro-
pitiatory sacrifice of it to the Ma-
jesty of England. The Gold Axe
of Ashantee that was, then, has
become an appartenance to the
British Crown. Has it? Du-
plicity being characteristio of
barbarians, the possibility of a
duplicate suggests some hesita-
tion in accepting that axiom. Are
you sure that the golden axe sur-
rendered by the King of ASHAN-
TEE is genuine ? Of course, as
we've axecepted it, it will be
axe-hibited somewhere - say in
the district of St. Mary-Axe.

PUNCH'S FANCY PORTRAITS.-No. 39.
It is no doubt necessary that
officers should be to a certain
extent practised in English com-
position, so as to be able to write
reports, despatches, and the like.
No wonder, then, that questions
in composition are set at the ex-
amination for admission to the
Royal Military College, Sand-
hurst. But surely the following
questions, which were set at the
examination on June 30, are not
a little ridioulous. There were
only three of them, as follows:
"1. A visit by Sir Roger de Cover-
ly and the Spectator to Lord's Cricket
Ground.
"2. The best means of improving
the Water Supply of London.
" 3. Memorandum by Sir John
MOORE, the night before the battle
of Corunna, containing instructions
for his successor, in case he falls in
the aotion, and á vindication of his
own memory."
Candidates were kindly told on
the paper not to attempt more
than one subject, and that
“Your Essay will be valued by
its quality rather than its quan-
tity." There is a fine satire
about that which is quite in keep-
ing with the childish nature of
the questions. Fancy asking a
Cadet to write a parody on the
Spectator, or to make a suggestion
on a subject which has puzzled
the most eminent Engineers of
the day. Some excuse may be
made for the last question, though
it is olumsily worded, and is
rather an exercise in Military
History than English Compo-
sition.' The Examiners seem to

Miss YELP said that it was all very well; but she
wanted to read her friend Mrs. SKINFLINT's paper on
the necessity of teaching the Philosophy of Foreign Ex-
changes to Pauper Children. This she proceeded to do
amidst considerable uproar, Sir SILKSTONE WALLSEND
continuing meanwhile the delivery of his address, and
Mr. BOGRYNE shaking his fist promiscuously. At this
stage of the proceedings a member of the Kyrle Society
was discovered in the act of surreptitiously distributing
peacock's feathers, tiger-lilies, and ox-eyed daisies among
the audience. When rebuked by the noble Chairwoman
for his misconduct, the hardened man replied that the
daisies were only an "oxide,” and as such would assist
the chemical and physiological functions of the Congress,
Miss NIOBE ONIONs moved that the Kyrle man's hair

“No; but that was. Did the gentleman like canister-

Mrs. SKINFLINT's paper.
Miss NIOBE ONIONS said the Congress had had quite
enough of the literate and loquacious lady's verbosity.

I think I never was so astonished in all my life excep when a
Royal Prinse gave me a Sovreign for his At. Silver glades? Silent

it in my youthful childhood, and Grinnidge Fare as I knowd it in
my herly manhood.

Swings and Rounderbouts, and Koker Nuts and Arnt Sallys, and
Donkies and plenty on 'em, and Ginger Beer Bottles lying about,
and lots of dirty paper and mess!
I was that disgusted and disapinted that I was amost a good mind
to go home, tho that's about the last place we ever thinks of going
to for an olliday, but luckily for me there was the beautiful trees,
only just a little ways off, looking so quiet and green and inwiting,
that I tucked up my trowsers, as it had been raining like fun, and
leavin all the noise and the mess and the wulgarity behind me,
plunged boldly slap into the Forest. Ah, what a change!
How any living man or woman or infant child can waste the
preshus hours of their seldom come hollidays, a swinging and a
Koko Nutting and all that rubbish, when their own butiful Forest is

his Patience was, but he larfed and said he was a Forrest Keeper
and not a Mad Keeper. He told me he used formally to carry a gun,
but as he wasn't aloud to shoot nothink, he soon got tired of carrying
it about all day, and so they never shoots now except in the Autum,
when they goes a Buck-hunting for the Lord Mare's Wenson.
He says that's about the best bit of fun he ever has, for the Com-
mittee comes down from London looking so dredful sleepy at having
to get up so early, that it's a sight to see, and as they knows no
more about shooting than the babe unborn, and that can't be much,
the Keepers drives the poor Dears close up to 'em, and then they all
bangs away at 'em, and of course misses 'em, and the Dears gallops
away, and then they all has to begin over again.

CALLED TO THE BAR-
PARLOUR.
As Coroners' Inquests mostly
have to deal with the solemn sub-
ject of death-death by accident,
death by suicide, or death by
murder-it would only be decent
if the country provided some
other place for hearing evidence
more suitable than the eternal
pothouse. To enter through a
more or less gaudy bar, to as-
semble in a room which may be
covered with sawdust, and is sure
to be adorned with varied adver-
tisements of Gin and Beer, and to
be regaled with the stale fumes
of last night's tobacco, beer, and
rum, will not stimulate that judi-
cial spirit in which “Crowners'
Quests" are generally so lament-
ably deficient. The wandering
garrulity of the bar-parlour may
naturally be expected in such an
atmosphere. Instead of confining
the investigation to the cause of
death-was he killed by accident ?
did he commit suicide? or was he
murdered ?--all kinds of irrele-
vant evidence is received and en-
couraged which ought to be left
to the Police and the Magistrates.
Scotland Yard requires more work
than it gets, though it does its
work very badly, and it does not
want to sit idle for a week while
a medico-legal functionary is
flooding the newspapers with talk,
and probably constructing an
untenable theory.
A STRANGE PERFORMANCE.
The Licensing chaos makes one
| acquainted with strange play-
| fellows. At Hengler's Circus, in
order to give a quasi legality to a
Promenade Concert, it is thought
advisable to represent an Operetta
on a table. This is not an inven-
tion of a Circus clown, but a regu-
lation of the LORD CHAMBER-
LAIN's. There is no time to erect
and clear away a stage, so the
performance takes place in a
space that is not much larger
than the back of a good old am-
bling circus-horse. This dramatic
make-shift is supposed to cover
the substantial Concert which
follows, and which ought to be
licensed by the Meddlevex Magis-
trates. At Covent Garden Con-
certs are given without a licence,
because Covent Garden claims to
be a patent theatre; and at Chel-
sea the Magistrates would license
both the Music and the Drama,
because the LORD CHAMBERLAIN'S
authority only reaches to Pimlico.
The next HOME SECRETARY will
probably look into this chaos;
the present one is quite above
such petty parochial details.

WAGGE for his thorough devotion to business. Everybody will ask

it is proposed to dedicate that amount annually to
developing the fisheries on the South and West
Coasts of Ireland.
It is said by those best qualified to know, that
at Baltimore, and off the neighbouring island
of Cape Clear, fish swarm in almost incredible
quantities. Hundreds of vessels from numberless
parts of Europe visit the coast every year to reap
the golden harvest. The poor Irish labourers,
who exist on the produce of their little patches of
land, are unable to share in it for want of boats.
A few have been supplied by the kindly help of
a gracious Lady, whose very name breathes of
charity, and supplied in so careful and so wise a
way, as to take from the welcome help any taint
of degradation. The money is lent for ten years,
without interest, repayable by instalments of one-
tenth per annum. No one man so assisted has ever
failed to pay his amount when due, and, Cape
Clear, which a very few years ago was a nest of
paupers, is now inhabited by a population of
prosperous and happy and contented people. Not
only are they better educated, better clad, and
better fed, but such a change has come over their
habits as makes them altogether a different race
of people.
Well now, Gentlemen of the Irish Society, you
have such an opportunity of condoning past
offences as comes but seldom to public men who
have wasted, if not abused, the trust confided to
them.
Your predecessors nobly performed the difficult
and important task committed to them. You

grave responsibilities. Show yourselves worthy

It is not honourable to waste trust-funds in
absurdity or extravagance.
It is honourable, most honourable, to assist in a
noble work which, while increasing the supply of
wholesome and delicious food for the hungry poor
of London, will at the same time enable thousands
of poor Irishmen to raise themselves from the
degraded state of poverty and misery in which the
people of Cape Clear existed a few years ago, to

SALOON CARRIAGES.
THE great advantage of
Saloon Carriages in securing
the safety of passengers from
murderous attacks has been
made manifest in America.
Murders take place in that
happy country, as they do in
England, but there is no pri-
vacy, no mystery, no sneaking
ruffianism about them. What
is done, is done in the broad
light of day. A band of six
or more marauders enter a
saloon carriage, and begin by
shooting the guard or con-
ductor. To stop the train they
shoot the driver, and then
they request the passengers
to give up their property.
Unless irritated by some tra-
veller who turns his back upon
the ruffians with contempt,
they abstain from further
murders, and leave the train
of saloon carriages at the
earliest possible opportunity.
The beauty of this system is
that the officers of justice
know what they have to do,
and do it. When they come
up with the ruffians, they pro-
bably shoot them then and
there, and, in any case, they
do not tell them that anything
they may say will be brought
in evidence against them.
Every ruffian who is alive
twenty-four hours after the
outrage, will live like a hunted
tiger. This gives the news-
papers very little material to
play with, but it delays the
passengers the least possible
time on their journey.

RULES FOR GENERALS ON THE RETIRED LIST.
(1.) THEY will be allowed to retain the seats they have
oocu pied for years past in the Service Clubs, and will be
permitted to grumble as much as ever over the decadence
of British prestige. (2.) They will not be called upon to
change their opinion about “the Army going to the doose,”
nor will they be invited to cease to believe that "the Dook
wouldn't have allowed it, Sir, and they wouldn't have
dared to try it on in his day, Sir!” (3.) They will not be
restrained from joining the Board of any new Company
of Limited or unlimited liability, that is in want of
really capable, useful, and practical Directors. (4.) They
will not be debarred from writing to the papers laudatory
letters of one another. (5.) They will be permitted to
become county magistrates to the great delight of wife-
beaters, and to the abject terror of starving pilferers of
half-pennyworths of carrots and mangel-wurzel. (6 and
lastly.) If they find their ample leisure very wearisome,
they will be permitted to learn, as a novelty, something
of the rudiments of the science of the profession of which
they were once ornamental rather than useful members.

Business done.-Finished Report on Land Bill.
Friday Night.-Out of the troubled Commons into the
peaceful Lords. There all glare and uproar and rancour
and laughter and Healy. Here dim lights, unbroken
silence, empty galleries, six Peers, and no Lord Chan-
cellor. Presently comes the noise of the tramp of many
feet, and, jostling, pushing, and laughing, the Commons,
surging at the bar, desecrate the silence and solemnity
of the place. Lord MONSON suggests that Lord THURLOW
should take the Woolsack, which he does, looking several
sizes too small by reason of having neither wig nor gown.
Then Lord Monson moves that the Land Bill be read a
First Time. There is no one to say “No," and the thing
is done. Great chance of a coup d'état. Lord CORK saw
it first, and thus began :-
"Say, MONSON, we're in a clear majority. Let's move
to suspend the Standing Orders, read the Bill a Second
Time, rush it through Committee, take the Report, and
read it a Third Time. Finish by midnight, and save no
end of trouble.” Lord Monson paused. "No," he said,
"people would talk." So they read the Bill a First Time,
and went home.
Business done.-Land Bill finally left the Commons.

AN ILL-USED INVENTOR.
An ingenious Austrian re-
cently invented a new soporific
which he appropriately called
the Bändiger or “tamer," as
a few drops sprinkled on a
man's head completely stupe-
fied him. But instead of being
hailed as a benefactor of his
species, this unfortunate che-
mist was warned that if he did
not give up his experiments,
and if he communicated his
secret to a living soul he would
be treated as a criminal. Why
doesn't this ill-used genius
come here and bring the Bän-
diger along with him ? It
must be a sublime invention !
Think of the glorious effect it
would have on Messrs. HEALY
and BIGGAR, on Lord Ran-
DOLPH CHURCHILL, and Sir H.
D. WOLFF, on certain mem-
bers of the Corporation of
London, on London and Pro-
vincial Vestrymen, on Beadles
of all kinds, and even on pri-
vate bores, who meet us in
Society and at Clubs. Let
this Austrian bring the Bän-
diger here as soon as he likes,
it is much wanted in this
country.
MARKETS AND MUSEUMS.

clusion the City Corporation

sington, the first effort in this
direction will be made in the
kingdom of King COLE. It is
only the other day, when the
New Central College for Tech-
nical Education was founded,
that the City Guilds were
charmed out of something like
£80,000 for this favoured
neighbourhood, and the first
rival of any importance to
Billingsgate will probably be
an artistic structure, standing
not far from the so-called
Haughty-cultural Gardens,
where the somewhat rough
persons engaged in the pur-
chase and sale of fish, will be
brought within the range of
the most refined and refining

Topical Heat.
THE weather lately has been
more Topical than Tropical.
The excessive heat has ex-
ceeded anything ever regis-
tered in Iceland, and has
necessitated extra furs and
warm under-clothing. Pro-
vision merchants and cooling
drink manufacturers have not
been the only sufferers. Seve-
ral , thousand magazine and
newspaper articles and jokes,
to say nothing of illustrations,
have been thrown on the hands
of the producers.

And opened the play with kind words from the Prince ;
While Paget delivered a graceful oration-
No Surgeon had ever a more honoured name-
And welcomed the Doctors of every nation,
With praise of the Art that has won them such fame.

Illustrious VIRCHOW was there from Berlin;
With CHARCOT from Paris, and Kraus and CASELLI,
While JENNER came forward to welcome them in.

The art of the healer shows no retrogression,

THE NATIONAL SLOW-COACH LEAGUE.
UNDER this title a body, independent of party politics (and of
common sense), has just been formed. “Convinced," the promoters
say, “ of the practical failure of the Progress (so called), which con-
sists in the ready adoption in the United Kingdom of all Improve-
ments (also so-called), Political, Social, or Scientific, notwithstanding
the extremely limited extent to which other countries (such as Lap-
land and Honolulu) follow our lead, this League is formed for the
purpose of preventing, by any means at its command, all advance in
Civilisation in this country, which is not on the true principle of
fair-play, shared to its fullest extent by all other countries in the
world. The policy advocated is thus explained :-
1. Careful adjustment of the rate of progress amongst the nations
to the pace of the slowest, it being unfair that a Hottentot should
be able to take things more slowly than an Englishman.
2. Free adoption of all unprogressive or reactionary schemes and
practices, in order that we may successfully compete (on the prin-
ciple of a donkey race in which the last ass wins) with Slow-Coaches,
Drowsyheads, and King Logs everywhere.
3. Adequate, that is to say prohibitory, duties to be levied on all.
improvements (so-called) to be removed only in the case of all
nations, from China to Peru, simultaneously agreeing to adopt them.
4. A very moderate duty to be levied upon all schemes for clogging
the wheels of the Juggernaut of Progress which may emanate from
foreign countries, the same being admitted free from all parts of our
own Empire prepared themselves to adopt them.
This League is to be affiliated with the National Fair Trade
League, an Association formed on similar principles but with more
limited scope. A donation fund of £10,000 a-year is to be raised to
five years, so as adequately to fight the battle of Anti-Progress. A
large portion of this is to be in the hands of a Special Partingtone
Committee, to be expended in the purchase of mops and brooms to
sweeping back the tide of Improvement. Among the larger su
scriptions to the fund are £2000 from Mr. S. TICKINTHEMUD, Hau.
well, £1000 from Mr. E. C. CRAWLE. the Treasurer, and $500 escu
from Sir TIMOTHY STOPPEM, Bart., and Mr. BLOCKER, M.P.

It was a little vulgar boy, exceeding sharp, and Scotch,
At Westminster Aquarium he stood the fish to watch.
He willingly had got at them, but, helpless so to do,
Indulged, like little vulgar boys in general, in “ Yah-boo!"
He was a very cock-nosed boy, which tempted him, no doubt,
To put his thumb unto that nose, and spread his fingers out.”
Says he, “Oyus, you look 0. K.” (the boy meant “Orl Korrect").
"You fancy you ’re big whales and things with backbones, I expect.
Yah-boo ! you flabby, flopping, floundering flats, as limp as small.
| You're only helpless jelly-fish, with not no spines at all!”.
The creatures in the Tank appeared his cheek to quite enjoy.
But took no other notice of that little vulgar boy.

gracious Lady, in developing the Fisheries on the South-West Coast
of Ireland, increasing the supply of Fish to this hungry Metropolis,

It appears, however, by the accounts of the extraordinary proceed-

members of the Irish Society, who are all members of the Corpora-

hope to be members of the Society during the next year or two,
practically rescinded the generous Resolution previously passed, and

[AUGUST 13, 1881.

THE LORD OF BURLEIGH.
(Slightly altered from the Poet Laureale.)
To the Bill he whispers gaily,
“Land Bill, I the truth must tell-
You 're a nuisance; but believe me
That I really love you well!”
She replies, that Irish Maiden,
“No one I respect like thee."
He is Lord of ancient Hatfield,
And a simple Land Bill she.
So most kindly he receives her
Merely with two hours' reproof,
Leads her to the Lords' Committee,
And she leaves her GLADSTONE's roof.
“I will strive to guard and guide you,
And your beauty not impair;
Only add a few amendments,
Prune a section here and there.
Let us try these little clauses
Which the wealthy Lords suggest;
No connection with FITZMAURICE,
Or with HENEAGE and the rest!”
All he tells her makes her queerer,
Evermore she seems to yearn
For her Commons and her GLADSTONE,
And the moment of return.
And while now she wonders wildly
Why she feels inclined to sink,
Proudly turns the Lord of BURLEIGH,
“I have drawn your teeth, I think!”.
Then her countenance all over
Pale and (emerald) green appears,
As he kicks her down the staircase,
'Mid their Lordships' wicked jeers.
But her GLADSTONE looked upon her,
Lying lifeless, worn, and spent,
And he said, “Your dress is ragged-
These must be arrears of rent."
Deeply mourns the Lord of BURLEIGH,
No one more distressed than he,
When the PREMIER moved the Commons
With the Peers to disagree..
And they gathered softly round her,
Did the Commons, and they said,
“ Bring the dress we sent her forth in.
That will raise her from the dead !”

THERE are many who hold that
mad-houses contain all the really
sensible people, and that the only
lunatics are the crowd at large;
and we might go farther and say
that the prisons contain all the
honest folk, while the thieves are
left untouched. Those who regu-
late, manage and thrive on the
food supply of London, are oer-
tainly not marvels of fair dealing,
and the Fair-Trade League will
do well to spend their Fifty
Thousand Pounds in reforming
these incorrigibles, before they
even dream of touching foreign
tariffs. Owing to our scanty and
disgraceful markets, London pays
nearly double what any other
important town in England pays
for its fish and vegetables. Be-

the Duke of MUDFORD, the me-
tropolis is made to suffer more
heavily in health, patience, and
pocket, than any other city in
the civilised world.

FRAGMENT OF A BRADLAUGHABLE BALLAD.
AIR—“ Lord Lovel.”
He strode and he strode till he reached the landing,
And then he couldn't "strode " any higher,
And there he saw Mister Inspector DENNING,
Who asked him at once to retire-'ire-'ire.
Suggesting that he should retire.
He tackled the Sergeant and his deputee,
A Messenger too in the Lobby,
When in came a lot of Constabularee,-
Mister BRADLAUGH he collared a Bobby—'obby—'obby;
But was collared too by that Bobby.
They fought and they tussled away down the stairs,
With many a gasp and a guggle,
And poor Daddy Longlegs, who won't say his prayers,
Lost his collar and tails in the struggle-'uggle-'uggle.
Lost his temper and tails in the struggle.
Who profits by this? The reply's not remote,
Not the Rough, nor the Bobby, nor Gaoler,
But as Mister BRADLAUGI must have a new coat,
'Tis a capital thing for his tailor-'ailor—'ailor,
A very good thing for the tailor.
Two Words about Wages.
By accounts from Ireland we learn that, at a meeting
of Irish Labourers lately held at Drogheda, a resolution
was “adopted declaring that a fair day's wage should
be given for a fair day's work." It was natural of
Irish Labourers to adopt that resolution, which, how-
ever, to improve their condition at all, obviously requires
to be adopted also by Irish farmers.

Now, if that Gentleman should happen to cast his eye on this here

young thing on the damp sands of a evening, to see the sun set, and
make her cry, but take her home, just before that time, and give her
for her Tea just a small piece of nice juicy Rum Stake, a leetle
underdone, and about half a dozen of oysters and half a pint of
Stout, and then let him read his Punch to her, and he'd see such a
diffrence in her in about a week that he'd hardly know her.
Sunset and sentiment and spooning is all very well in their way,
but depend upon it, Young Ladies, the first thing a sensible young
fellow looks for in a wife, is good health. No objection to beauty
and good temper to follow, but good health indispenserble. So don't
dispise a homely stake now and then. There's a wigour and a

his copy of GISBORNE's Duties of Women. To his only son, THOMAS

Cork, sometime M.P. for County Smithereen, was offered for pro-
bate on the 10th instant by The O'DUNBILK, M.P., and Captain the
Hon. LOONEY MACTWOLTER. The property, for reasons subse-
quently to be mentioned, was not sworn under any specific sum;
but it was understood to be Immense. The testator bequeathed
£10,000 to the Royal Humane Society, and legacies of the same
amount (all free of legacy duty) to the Royal Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals, to the Ladies' Work Society, to the Royal
Hospital for Women, to the Hospital for Sick Children, to the London
School of Medicine for Women, to the Asylum for Idiots, and to the
Cabmen's Benevolent Institution. Legacies of five hundred pounds
were bequeathed to the Royal Literary Fund, to the Freemasons'
Girls' School, to the British Orphan Asylum, to the Home for Jolly
Old Boys, and to the Trustees of the Whiskey Drinking League. All
the testator's numerous nephews and nieces (he died a bachelor) were
handsomely provided for. The diamond-hilted rapier presented to
him by the late King of AURUCANIA he bequeathed to Mr. HENRY

CRUMBS OF COMFORT.
A GREAT many people have
left town, and many more are
preparing to take holiday.
In a great majority of cases,
too, arrangements have been
made for repairs, papering
and the like to be executed
during the vacation. How
sweet a thought then for the
holidays is suggested by the
evidence given in a burglary
case the other day. It appears
that the chief accomplice of a
gang of burglars was a car-
penter, whose share of the
swag was earned by the in-
formation he gave as to the
fastenings of the doors and
windows on premises where
he had been employed. “He
also kept a general look-out,”
it was said, "" as to where the
valuable property was kept."
We should be curious to know
whether there are many men of
this stamp keeping a." general
look-out” on plate-boxes and
jewel cases, and with an eagle
eye to the spoons. How plea-
sant for Paterfamilias when
taking his ease by the sea to
reflect that the British work-
man at home is picking up
information regarding the
doors and fastenings, and
keeping a "general look-out"
as to the situation of the
strong box! Such a case
ought to make people quite
comfortable when they go
away from home, and leave
the carpenters in possession.
POLICEMEN AT PLAY.

and those of the Metropolitan
(Portsmouth Dockyard) Police.
This, too, was a return match,
the first having taken place at
Haslar. Not only, therefore,
on one day but on two days,
and that during the present
year, the Portsmouth Dock-
yard' Police and the South-
ampton Borough Police have
had sufficient leisure to admit
of eleven of their number on
either side being told off to
exercise their muscular ener-
gies in manly sport. Happy
Dockyard, and happy Bo-

you drowsily to a meditative service, and not to a

ample time to study the country. You see the peasant
proprietor tilling his ground, and raising patches of pro-
ductive agriculture amidst acres of bog-land and fir-
forest. Some of the low-roofed wooden villages are like
collections of Indian wigwams. There is no excuse for
dilapidated walls and roofs in a country where plenty
of wood can be had for nothing ; but, such as they are,
they are not as bad as the turf huts in the West of
Ireland. It is the old story-drink. A revenue as large
as that of England is drawn even more largely from

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.

Thursday Night.--Always have thought it would be
a delightful thing if the Irish Members would make
their speeches in their native language. They could say
what they liked, and no one could call them to order.
T. P. O'CONNOR's got hold of my idea, and partially
worked it to-night. Talking about Mr. FORSTER's rule in
Ireland, he said, "it was, without sahn-frars, tyranny."
Don't know what this means. But it sounds picturesque.
Asked Sir CHARLES DILKE. Under Secretary for Foreign
Affairs must know foreign languages, including Irish.
Sir CHARLES evidently tickled at something, but too
polite to laugh.
* "It's not Irish, mon ami," he said, “though it would
be too much to say it's French. T. P. has read in
OUIDA's novels, or perhaps in the London Journal,
about something being said 'sans phrase.' The 'with-
out'is tautological ; but the intention was good."
I suppose this is all right. But I believe it was Irish.
Business done. Mr. PARNELL's vote of censure nega-
tiyed by 83 votes against 30.
Saturday.-Irish Members had their last entertain-
ment to-day. Opened last night; kept at it from five
in the afternoon till close upon four this morning, and
began again at noon. Grows a trifle dull, and a little
monotonous. Find it possible to have too much of
HEALY, and a great deal too much of T. P. O'CONNOR.
Rumoured in the House to-day that A. M. SULLIVAN
is worse. Everyone, that is the dozen or score here, un-
affectedly sorry to hear this. The death of A. M. SULLI-
VAN would be a loss equally divided between Ireland and
England. Has shown through his too brief Parliamentary
career, how an Irishman may be unflinchingly true to
his national politics, and yet preserve the courtesy of a
gentleman. Inflexibly honourable, stubbornly honest
in his political relations, witty, humorous, eloquent, and
skilled in fence, SULLIVAN, with one or two others, has
succeeded in keeping the intellectual fame of Ireland
from being swamped by the stagnant waters of clownish
mediocrity, which for seven long years have sapped its
foundations in the House of Commons.
Business done.--Irish Votes in Supply.

"OUT OF THE WOOD.”
At last! Long hid from heaven's free light,
Fared stoutly on the adventurous Knight,
With firmly-poised lance.
Through gloomy glade, through tangled fret
Of thorn and bramble closely set
To stay his bold advance.
Nor these alone, but shapes of fear
Peopled the vistas dim and drear
Of that enchanted wood;
Ear-vexing voices boding ill,
And spectral sprites of wicked will,
And ghouls, a gibbering brood.
Yet on fared he, though checked, unstayed ;
Though shocked, unshaken; all arrayed
In proof from heel to crest :
And now, though pale from perils past,
Victor the Knight comes forth at last
From that amazing quest.
With lifted hand, with eyes aglow,
And, seated at his saddle-bow,
Safe and unshackled, she,
The leaguered Lady whom to aid
He braved that black wood's boding shade
And baneful mystery.
Good Knight! Though grey, of strength and truth
Which shame the force and faith of youth,
A triumph won right well!
Oh, may it bring long peace and rest

PROFESSOR MUDDLEHEAD says he has discovered a small planet 6 41, which
no one else can see, and don't want to, in the latitude of Jupiter, not far from
the perihelion of Saturn, and outside the apogee of Urania.
Mr. SELFE POFFE, the Author of Dialogues of Dustmen, the racy style of
which was apparent to no one save the Author and a few friends whom he
asked to dinner, will shortly bring out a companion volume, Conversations of
Costermongers.
Mr. MAHLSTICK, who painted a portrait of Mr. BRIGHT last year, though we
think he called it ĠLADSTONE, but it was as like one as the other, is engaged
on a portrait of Mr. BUMPTIOUS, a leading member of the St. Pancras Vestry,
The paupers are at last avenged.
Mr. METEOROLOGICAL OFFICIOUS writes to us to say that last Tuesday was the
hottest day he has known since 1839. As Mr. METEOROLOGICAL OFFICIOUS was
born in 1841, this information is of great value.
Mrs. MARY BOODLES, the eminent Lady Doctor, is bringing out another
edition of her work, Juvenile Diseases and How to Cure Them. We regret
to learn that all her children are down with whooping cough.
Mr. LYCURGUS DRACO, Q.C., whose book on The Practice of the Divorce
Court, is a standard one, and a manual for all law students, will shortly appear,
we hear, as a co-respondent.
We understand that the MS. of Mr. WEIGHTY's Epic on the Seventeenth Cen-

À PROPOS DE POISSON.
As Mr. Tools and the Chan-
cellor of the Duchy of Lan-
caster were lounging listlessly
on one of the recess benches on
Waterloo Bridge, one showery
afternoon last week, the latter,
looking towards Charing Cross,
asked the great comedian
whether it wasn't a very lu-
crative thing to be a theatrical
Manager.
"I would sooner manage
there," replied the hero of
Artful Cards, giving a wink
in the direction of Billings-
gate.
The Chancellor looked puz-
zled. “Ha!” he said, after a
moment's reflection. "I see.
The net receipts, eh?”
“No," was the quick and
witty rejoinder, "my idea,
JOHN, is to make my fortune
as sole Lessee!”

THE NEW ARM-CHAIR.
AIR—" The Old Arm-Chair."
Pleased Premier sings :-
I love it, I love it; will WORMS,
now, dare
To nag me for loving my new
Arm-chair?
I shall treasure it long, 'tis a
genuine prize,
Of cosy make, of convenient
size.
'Twill be bound to my heart
by a thousand links,
By memories pleasant of
“forty winks."
Thanks, men of Greenwich,
whose thoughtful care
Supplies me this capital new
Arm-chair.
I have sat in the Commons
this many a day,
Till my eyes are dimmish, my
locks gone grey:
Oh, the hours I have lounged,
and-with trouble-smiled
Whilst CHURCHILL cheeked
or the Pats ran wild ;
Till the Treasury cushions
seemed cold as lead,
And hard'as a prisoner's timber
bed.
By Jove, how I wish I could
wheel you there
And lounge on your cushions,
my new Arm-chair!
But HARCOURT's waiting, and
I must go;
He can't stand his Whitebait
cold, you know.
Were it not for the feed and
these swells at my side,
My talk might flow on in a
lava-like tide.
Ah! excuse this tear that
bedews my cheek,
I should very much like to
talk on for a week.
Now myself from your pre-
sence I really must tear,
But I thank you once more
for my new Arm-chair!

So he; the Commons heard him, and raised such thunderous cheer,
He stalked about the Senate like King TARQUIN in his pride,
That underneath his strawberry leaves CECILIUS quaked with fear.
And most of the Patrician host were marshalled on his side.
Then for a little moment the People held their breath :

SUMMER NUMBERS.
(A Song of Memories by an Elderly Singer.)
SURCEASE of toil, still solitude, soft sun,
Far from the motley mob's gregarious run,
The fogey seeks, whose care is Number One.
A solitude à deux, spooned softly through,
Leaf-screened beneath the unbetraying blue,
Is the elysium of the amorous Two.
A dancing boat and moonlight on the sea,
Taste-measured mirth, wave-mellowed melody,
And company may e'en be found in Three.
Clear Thames soft echoing to the pulsing oar,
The eddy's ripple and the weir's loud roar,
Gladden the ears of a hard-pulling Four.
Nor shall the sunniest, sweetest girl alive,
Prattling, as through the wave the blue blades drive,
Stern-seated, spoil the crew by making Five.
A woodland pic-nic! Could a COCKER fix
(Unless as dull as the dim shores of Styx)
Yon gleeful gathering at less than Six?
Or brand the odd less blissful than the even,
(Seeing her watchet eyes are so like heaven),
If one arch sylph should swell the band to Ševen?
Nay, "stretch an octave.”. Who, with heart elate,
Beating the nut-hung woods, would joy abate
Because the scattered echoes numbered Eight?
Nay, skirting the green vineyards of the Rhine.
Four girls, four lovers, and a sleek divine,
Who'd murmur at the Muses' number, Nine ?
Charmed numbers ? Let dull seers stale fables tell,
Are not all numbers magic in their spell,
With Youth, Love, Joy, and Jest assorted well?
Yet Two, for choice! Some prejudice yet cumbers

A WEALTH-ENDOWED
WORKHOUSE.
Dr. DIPLOCK has lately had,
within a short space of time,
to hold as many as three
inquests on inmates of St.
George's (Hanover Square)
Workhouse Infirmary, who
had jumped out of the win-
dows of that benevolent insti-
tution. About twelve months
ago a pauper leaped from a
window of the workhouse
itself. Fish kept in an aqua-
| rium of which the water is
ill-aërated are apt at times to
leap out of it; but that is
because they feel themselves
uncomfortable within it, which
cannot be the case with the
inmates of any department of
| St. George's Workhouse. That
Charity being supported by a
parish abounding in mansions
of the most opulent Nobility
and Gentry, its arrangements
are all doubtless of the most
agreeable description, far su-
perior to those regulated by
ordinary parochial economy.

PARALUNE.
A POE-TIC FRAGMENT.
[A new moonshade, called a Paralune, has been introduced to
preserve Ladies' complexions from the alleged injurious effects
of moonlight.]
THEN I looked round for SUKEY, and missed her ;
But back she came bounding right soon;
And I said, “What's the matter, sweet Sister ?”
She pointed at once to the moon,
To the silvery sheeny full moon.
“Hang it, SUKEY,” I cried, “you 're a twister!
What's that? To explain were a boon."
She replied, “Paralune! Paralune!
'Tis the moonshade, the new Paralune.”
Then she said, "She's a danger, is Dian,
A satellite Ladies mistrust,
To the skin she is terribly tryin',
And makes one's complexion like dust.
Red, freckled, or dingy as dust
Nay, tanned like the tawny-maned Lion."
" What nonsense!” cried I, in disgust.
SUKEY sobbed, “You're unjust, you 're unjust!
And carry a moonshade I must!"
Then I melted, and tried to look pleasant,
And tempted her out 'neath the moon,
Explained the full disc and the crescent,
Each scoriac rock and lagoon;
And her moonshade she dropped very soon ;
But next morning her nose was rubescent,
Her temper was much out of tune;
And she wailed, "Paralune! Paralune!
'Tis the fault of my lost Paralune!”

All in different tune and time,
Opposite to where I'm staying,
Till I feel impelled to crime.

That those Teutons follow me,
And their brazen noise grows stronger,

Broken by a hideous roar,
What the fiend calls “ fresh cucumbers';

On the shore a hideous riot
Comes to vex my troubled soul.

From whom I had hoped to flee,
And methinks he means to tarry-

On the shore when I lay back, it
Seems as if the children then
Came and made by far more racket
Than they do near other men.
And the boatmen's objurgations
On the wind come foul and free,
When I make perambulations
By the Sea.
So in sadness and in sorrow,
I resolve to fly the shore;
I'll go back to Town to-morrow,-

No flower-girl of Italy,

Simply honest Stepney NANCE,
Cross-shawl'd, coarsish, bold of glance,
Seeking, reckless of romance,
Merely money!
She, to catch the careless eye
Of the dandy lounging by,
Trims her blossoms. Well, and why
Stay such petty traffics ?
NANCE must live, mayhap must bring
Food to helpless lips; a thing
Honester than some they sing
In soft sapphics.
NANCE is honest yet; she sells
Not herself, but buds and bells.
What if, driven hence, she swells
Vice's viler legions ?
Will the harsh “Move on!” have done
Public service, adding one

“YOUR SONG AND SENTIMENT !”
"In acknowledging the receipt of a political song sent him
from Sheffield, Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE writes:- There was
a wise man of old who said, “ Give me the making of the people's
songs, and I will give you the making of their laws." I cer-
tainly accept the doctrine so far as to believe that good songs
will do a great deal more than speeches.'”-Yorkshire Post.
BRAVO, Sir STAFFORD! You cannot be wrong ;
Never mind speeches, but give us a song.
Views on Free Trade may be hazy or strong;
Bother orations, and give us a song.
Speeches are wearisome often, and long;
Why should you make them, but give us a song,
Let your opponents go at it “ding-dong”-
Spare us your speeches, and give us a song.
Though folks to wild declamation may throng,
Never be tempted, but give us a song.
Thoughts upon trade from New York to Hong Kong
Often are prosy, so give us a song.
Others may speechify loud as a gong,
You have a wiser plan,-give us a song.
Though you may feel the political thong,
Carol out sweetly, and give us a song !

AN AUTUMN VALENTINE.
FORESTS are fair when the suns of September
Wane, and the gloaming grows deeper in gloom;
Sunsets are red as the rosiest ember,
Seen when the lamps are alight in the room.
You too, carina, like leaves in October,
Change with the season to startle the town;
Quakerlike colour, seductively sober,
Shows a blonde beauty looks bravest in brown.
Fitting it is too, at time like the present,
When in the covers the sharp shots are heard,
That the adornments you filch from the pheasant,
Serve to remind me you're fair as that bird.
What though my shooting my friends voted splendid,
Though Land and Water has echoed my fame,
You give one glance, and my short flight is ended,
You have an eye has a deadlier aim,
1
Sometimes the softest of possible serges
Drapes you, and seems the one thing you should
wear,
While from the neck of the bodice emerges
Daisy-like frills that are fatally fair.
I am not learned in seam and in gusset,
Dressmaking never was taught by the Cam,
Yet nothing rarer than that robe of russet
Ever was fashioned, quite certain I am.
Once at Lawn-Tennis the tints of the sunset
Found a red rival in frock that you wore;
Haply I think you remember that one “set,"
In it I vowed to be jealous no more.
While on your head perched a cap so coquettish,
Even a hermit had danced at the sight;
Weren't you a wee bit exacting and pettish ?
No, no! Of course you were utterly right.
Yet what avails this my list of your dresses,
Though I should chance to remember the rest ;
Quite in a puzzle, your Poet confesses
He has no notion in which you look best,
No matter what freak of fashion you follow,
How frills and flounces and furbelows fall,
One thing is clear, you beat other girls hollow,
And as to dresses-look best in them all!

TALES BY A STOUT TRAVELLER.–No. 1.
Introduction Preliminary and Prefatory, showing not how I
became Stout, which is merely a detail, but how I became
a Traveller, apart from beer Entire.
I am stout, very; some have called me extra double
stout; a fellow did so as I entered an omnibus one wet
day. I withered him with one of my looks, for I glory
in my fine proportions; and indulging in this thought,
I sprang from my couch like springbok at dewy morn,
though later than usual, for I was anxious to get to
work ; so I at once seated myself, threw on my lightest
dressing-suit, at the same time opening the window, and
stirring the fire by my writing-table, to which the girl
sets light early every morning. Anxious to finish off
my great work-a lecture I was preparing for public
delivery, being about to read it in private at the house
of a friend, to a few near relations, distant that very
night by rail many miles away; in fact, a maiden effort,
which had engrossed much time and thought, my aim
being to render it impromptu in style, combined with
an elementary air; and therefore, I worked at it near
the fire with the window open, so as to secure those cha-
racteristics so essential to brain power.
At that moment the kitchen clock struck the hour of
noon, "Would it were midnight," I murmured ; and
then reflected that it was so in New Zealand, so that if
I shut my eyes it would be the same thing. Imbued
with this knowledge, which is power, I rose from my
seat and grasped my MS., marvelling how time had
slipped through my fingers unperceived, an example
which my undried pages proceeded to follow by slipping
on to the floor,
I gazed at my fluttering work as it lay scattered about,
a state of things much increased by a gust of wind,
which, bringing in my breakfast, much accelerated,
though only tea and toast, through the door, suddenly
thrown open at the very moment when I was struggling
violently on my knees in order to get under the bed to
abstract some truant sheets, from which I only emerged
in time to rush on all fours to the grate to rescue several
others from the devouring element, and secure those still
held back by the fire-irons, two of which the sheets,
not the fire-irons-were discovered weeks after on the
top of my wardrobe, a considerable portion of which had
been carried through the open window into the garden,
after which I rushed headlong, clearing the paling with

“WATER, WATER NOWHERE, AND NOT A DROP TO

It appears that some six weeks ago several respectable West-End
tradesmen, finding their supply of water suddenly cease, summoned
the Grand Junction Waterworks Company for certain pains and
penalties for the fearful inconvenience to which they had been ex,
posed. After six weeks' delay, the case was heard last week, and
the following lucid and satisfactory judgment delivered.
These summonses are taken out under the 43rd section of the
Waterworks Clauses Act, for omitting to supply water to Mr. JAYŞ
Mourning Warehouse, where very large quantities of water must
of course be in constant requisition. So far so good. But in 1010
he contracted with the Company to be supplied under 15 & 16 Vict.,
c. 157, 8. 49, which was a private Act incorporated with the other
Act. The Act of 1852 had also been incorporated with another Act,
by which power was given by the former Act to make special con:
tracts. If the Legislature had meant something else, they would
have mentioned it. The Act of 1852 excepts section 35 but not 43;
therefore the Company is liable to the penalties imposed by the Act
of 1847. So they were fined £10, and £6°68. costs. Of course notice of
appeal was given. If this is not satisfactory and intelligible to every
consumer of water in the Metropolis, it only proves that his brain,
like much of the water supplied to him, is about as clear as mud.

O FAIR TRADE!

AIR-" O Fair Dove !"
METHOUGHT the stars on our side did fight,
With our Fair Trade flag unfurled ;
I said “I will holloa and put things right
In this mad one-sided world.”
We raised our cry; we went so fast
That the Rads shot angry scorn;
But now, with our brand-new flag half-mast,
We mourn, and mourn, and mourn.
O Fair Trade! O Fond Trade!
O Trade for Old England best.
Let me alone, for that dream is flown,
And my bosom knows not rest.
JAMES LOWTHER stood, with right good will
Flouting Free Trade alway;
I looked for applause, but all was still,
It is clear that the cry won't pay.
I went to hear Lord RANDOLPH speak,
But no favouring signs could I trace,
And amusement's smile at the lordling's cheek
Rose up in the People's face.
O First Love! 0 Last Love !
O Love of this True-Blue heart !
To think you should come to be called a hum
When you'd made so fair a start!
Sir STAFFY spake behind his hand,
His voice was bland and sweet :
Methought he said, “The crux of Land
This way we may not meet.
Of bread that's dear the Plebs won't hear ;
I take no place, no part
In dwelling more on this old score,
'Tis only a false start.”
O Fair Trade! O Fond Trade!
One heart, of joy forlorn,
For thy fair hopes, thus overcast,
Doth mourn, and mourn, and mourn.

I assented.
“Britisher ?” he continued.
“Yes," I replied, more boldly, as the Civis Romanus
feeling came over me.
"Ah! thought as much,” he replied, in the moody tone
of a savage despot divided in his mind as to whether he
would kill a captive at once, or torture him slowly to
death. “Wall,” he continued, “ you can't help that;
but look it here, I hate you all!” and he glared at me
with his eyebrow.
I think I was going to offer him an apology for the
accident of my birth, when he continued, “I like the
look of you though, and I'll give you a drink.”
I smiled feebly as he drew from his pocket a small
bottle, which he handed to me, but withdrew at once,
evidently from a sense of politeness, and thinking that
he ought to inspire confidence by drinking first. With
this view he raised the bottle to his lips, and drained it.
“Run out!” he observed, as he replaced the bottle
in his coat-pocket, an action which enabled me to see
that he had a revolver in the pocket made, according to
the custom of the country, to carry that weapon at the
back of his pants.
Thereupon I rose from my chair and muttered some
fictitious allusion about breakfast, of which meal, or the
apology for it, I had already partaken.
“Breakfast be eternally lost !” he exclaimed, only he
put it more tersely. “You have had it, I saw you at it
when I came in ;” and as he spoke he laid his hand on
my arm and forced me down into my chair again with
the force and grip of a gorilla.
What was to be done? I could not grapple with him,
for he was as powerful in person as in language: and
besides he carried a formidable bludgeon ; I could not
fly, he had a revolver in his pants, the contents of which
I felt certain he would discharge at me if I attempted
a retreat however speedy. Yet for all this he was only
a small, elderly cripple, against whom it would have been
ignominious to call for aid ; besides, I had no charge to
bring against him, except that his looks frightened me,
which would have been a degrading admission. More-
over, I felt convinced that on my slightest attempt to
raise an alarm, the revolver would have done its fatal
work long before assistance could have reached me. So
I resolved to remain passive, and was subsequently
convinced of the wisdom of this decision. At one time

DARK DEEDS IN CHES-

THE town of Chesterfield,

it had been meant for an eccle-

parlous state. The Corpora-
tion has quarrelled with the
Gas Company, because the
latter raised its prices, and
refused to pay them, where-
upon the Company has taken
away the street-lamps, and the
town is in a state of Cimme-

WHILST facts be facts, whilst truth its cold douche showers
Hydrants and squirts can ne'er be equal powers;
One sturdy spout will spoil the sputterers all,
So scatter saucy, squirt-armed boyish foes,
When one stout fact-pumper turns on the hose,
It is but holiday pastime, after all.
If Free Trade's not worth keeping, let it go.
But shall it ? John and WILLIAM answer “No!

Who by-and-by makes minor tootlers mute,
And ever strengthening, silences them all.

Pitted 'gainst sixty squirters following suit,
Makes 'em turn tail, and quickly drenches all.
Pheugh'! how the icy flood does soak and chill!
Wet backs and breeks he'll give 'em, Triton WILL,
Among the Fair-Trade Minnows, small fry all.
And as “Old Triton blew his wreathéd horn,"
So, half in merriment, and half in scorn,

CHARACTER OF A CHANNEL ISLAND.
A SAD account of Jersey is given in a speech lately made by the
Lieutenant-Governor, Major-General NICHOLSON, at à Temperance
meeting. The gallant General is reported to have said that "he
had seen much service in many parts of the world, but never any
where where drunkenness was so prevalent as in Jersey." Lets
hope the General was wrong in this particular ; but, if correct, no
might have summed up the character of Jersey in the title and
burden of an old patriotic and once popular song, and have called it
“ A Right Littlē, Tight Little Island”-very tight little island.
Perhaps it was only a rather loose statement about the tightness.

USTATU

OUR POLICE.
A SPANISH INVESTMENT.
Running Commentary on the New Code, by Verges Wrongscent, Esq. I (By Our Electric Light-brained Artist, who says he took it on the
Black Spot.)
BEFORE considering the duties of the Police, it is necessary to say
a few preliminary words about their dress. The law then-as if
disputing the truth of the well-known proverb-that holds that “it
is not the coat that makes the man,” insists that it is the coat that
makes the Policeman. And to such a jolly length does it carry its
conviction on this point, that it makes the assumption of the
character of a Constable a punishable offence, enjoining that “any
person who puts on the dress, or takes the name, designation, or
character of a Constable for the purpose of doing, or procuring to be
done, any act, which such person would not be entitled to do, or pro-
cure to be done, of his own authority, or for any other unlawful
purpose, shall be liable, in addition to any other punishment to which
he may be liable for such offence, to a penalty of £10.” It is clear
from this that the appearance of a Policeman in the Harlequinade of
any Pantomime is a punishable offence within the meaning of the
Act, and that Messrs. GILBERT and SULLIVAN's chorus, in the Pirates
of Penzance, should have inflicted on those Gentlemen, conjointly
with Mr. D'OYLEY CARTE, a nightly fine of about £160 during the
whole run of the Opera in question; and this, too, “in addition to
any other punishment,” probably imprisonment with hard labour, The Garter Procession. Hon. G. L. Gower in hat, plume, and feathers ; Lord

matter may prove even yet worth the attention of rival Managers.
But to resume the subject of the Constable's dress. He may on no
account improve on it, but must wear it in its rough simplicity, as it
is. Article VII., for instance, strictly forbids any “combination of
uniform," however happy in conception. No Policeman of the most
artistic tastes would, therefore, be allowed to have his uniform made
of pale_sage green cotton velvet, or wear with it a rich Spanish
Cloak, Beefeater's halberd, and Life Guard's helmet. Nor again
would be in the severest thunderstorm be allowed to carry an um-
brella. Indeed so stringent are the regulations that preserve the
uniform intact for the benefit of the Force alone, that Article IX.
enjoins that on a Constable being suddenly dismissed for any offence,
all his clothing shall be instantly taken from him "excepting only
one pair of trousers and one pair of boots, of an issue prior to the two
latest issues ;” a costume which, even in fair condition, and it is more
than doubtful that this would be the case, would entail on him a most
embarrassing walk from the station to the house of his nearest relatives.
Close, and almost niggardly, however, as are the precautions taken
in one direction, a lavish and indeed spendthrift outlay is sanctioned
in another, or if the Constable in uniform is allowed little or no

HUNTING BISMARCK.
From Our Own Correspondent under the Table.
“ Und Unter den Linden 's a very fine place,
Though hotels there I find rather dear
But where they make Hockheim, und what it's made of,
I haven't the slightest idea.".
B. roared at this song, and thumped the table till I thought the
whole structure would collapse on the top of me, and G., encouraged
by his host's hilarity, was equally joyous. It was gratifying to see,
or rather to hear, two such hard-working and important men enjoy-
ing themselves, as if no such troublesome problem existed as the
Balance of Power.
I had several attacks of cramp before the French Statesman rose
to go, and then he was ten minutes finding his hat, which he had
placed on his chair, and sat upon. As the night was wet, the Man
of Iron kindly lent him an umbrella. Go's last words, as B. let him
out by the back door, were, “Give my compliments to the Guy'nor,
but not a word about this visit. Strict Q.T. Comprenez ?”.
B. followed his guest down-stairs, and no sooner were their backs
turned, than B.'s infernal dog rushed into the room after the frag-
ments of the feast, and immediately scented me under the table.
He “went for me" in preference to the food, and I had barely
time to get to the window, with my clothes considerably damaged,
when the Man of Iron re-appeared at the back door, and at once
grasped the situation !

has been obliged to cut off the entail, is desirous of meeting with a purchaser,
of sporting tastes, to whom the valuable freehold of nearly a quarter of an
acre of wild forest moorland, well stocked with game, and situate within two
minutes' walk of five metropolitan railway stations, would prove an attractive
consideration. Red deer, quite tame, may be stalked, and salmon netted in a
neighbouring park all the year round, while grouse and partridge shooting,
for which no licence is required, begins at any season, entirely at option of
owner. The fixtures, which consist of the handsome Venetian blinds, a pack
of highly trained staghounds (poodles), who are accustomed after the day's
run to give an entertainment in a neighbouring circus, and a man who is

“I feel the most perfect and abso-
lute confidence that nothing that will
ever be sanctioned by the Parliament
of this country will tend to degrade
your great Corporation, or to impair
its efficiency, but that new dignity,
new energy, and a further enlarge-
ment of public confidence, fresh records
of good work done, and of great ser-
vices rendered to the country, will be
the unfailing consequence of any such
measure as Parliament will adopt
for the purpose of dealing with the
Municipal Institutions of London.

I'VE despised you, old Worm, for I think you 'll admit
That you never were beautiful even in youth ;
I've impaled you on hooks, and not felt it a bit;
But all's changed now that DARWIN has told us the truth
Of your diligent life, and endowed you with fame-
You begin to inspire me with kindly regard :
I have friends of my own, clever Worm, I could name,
Who have ne'er in their lives been at work half so hard.
It appears that we owe you our acres of soil,
That the garden could never exist without you,
That from ages gone by you were patient in toil,
Till a DARWIN revealed all the good that you do.
Now you've turned with a vengeance, and all must confess
Your behaviour shonld make poor humanity squirm,
For there's many a man on this planet, I guess,
Who is not half so useful as you, Mister Worm!

AT Aberdeen they just now describe Lord ROSEBERY as “The

A Clergyman of good position, who, as resi-

of a first-class FIRE-ESCAPE, for which he
has, unfortunately, no available accommodation on
his premises, will be prepared to treat for its dis-
posal on extremely liberal terms. Though old-
fashioned, it is, on the whole, in excellent condi-
tion, having sliding rack, adjusting hooks, safety
netting (very little damaged), and Binks's Patent
Fifth-Floor Elongators. The mounting being
easy, and descent almost instantaneous, it would
prove invaluable in a library of lofty and imposing
proportions, to a literary Nobleman of an irritable
and impatient habit. Cut down with judgment,
it could also be utilised as a Landau, and driven
in the Park with much effect. A bachelor of in-
dependent and retiring tastes, living on an elevated
flat, yet desirous of avoiding the publicity of
the staircase, would find this an excellent contri-
vance for quitting and returning to his chambers
in a quiet and secluded manner. Might be used

AIR-“ Adgofion mebyd."
“ The front row of choristers was composed of girls in Welsh
costumes, two of them wearing the droll steeple-crowned hat
still habitually seen in Welsh country places. The Prince of
WALES bestowed his first notice upon these damsels, pointed
them out to the Princess, and sent his sergeant-footman to bring
them over to the carriage.”- Report of Royal Visit to Swansea.
Oh, we shall have sweet recollection
Of Swansea, and what happened there;
We stood in a row for inspection,
And sung to the Prince a Welsh air,
We wore the old hats of our nation,
That figure in legends and tales,
And won from the Prince admiration,
And from the fair Princess of WALES.
Oh, day for all years to remember,
When summoned to stand near the Prince,
Our cheeks red as leaves in November,
Our pleasure and pride would evince.
For years we shall tell the proud story,
Till memory totters and fails,
Of how we won honour and glory,
The happiest girls in all Wales !

(By Our Own Pen-and-Ink-Wisitor at Kilmainham Gaol.)
“What do you think of Archbishop CROKE's letter
on the Land League Manifesto ?” I asked.
“Sir," replied Mr. P-RN-LL, "had I the misfortune to
be a Saxon, I should misplace the aspirate, and speak
of him as the Harsh-bishop.”
“The League must be suppressed," I observed.
“Give you fellows an inch, and you'll take an ell."
“They've taken a PARN-ELL," he replied, pleasantly
enough," and you and I will take some 'LL' together,"
and he filled our glasses from his private whiskey-bottle.
“Here's to the ‘LL'!” says I, meaning either the
Lord Lieutenant or the whiskey.
“Here's to the ‘LL' and the ‘LLL’!” cries he;
“that's the Land League and the Ladies' Land League!"
I emptied my glass. When in prison, do as they do in

FACE TO FACE; OR, THE TWO FORCES.
No Force ? Hypocritical Anarchy's plea !
The plaint of the bludgeon-armed burglar at bay ;
The cry of brute strength against strength sworn to free;
The protest of plague 'gainst the power that would stay!
No Force ? When frank Violence fronteth the light,
And sinister cruelty slinks in the dark;
When against the black terror that haunteth the night,
The weak find no bulwark, the honest no ark.
No Force? When 'tis only brute force that is free,
When the will of the lawless seems stronger than law;
When Justice stands swordless and hinging her knee,
And Freedom struck nerveless seems palsied with awe!
Mad rant, maudlin sophistry. Force, at stern need,
Is the right arm of Right against violent Wrong;
To 'stablish the just against pitiless greed,
And compass the weak with the arm of the strong.
Two Forces, sworn foes; and they stand face to face,
One calm, unyindictive, not hurried by hate
Or made ruthless by wrath, with a touch of stern grace
In those iron-set lips, to which duty is fate.
Protective and passionless, setting straight blade
At the breast of its foe, yet uneager to strike.
That foe, blind and brutal, takes hate as a trade.
Both Forces, 'tis true, but how strangely unlike.
And “Force is no remedy!” Granted, but force
Must protect patient healing when passion at flood

And drown Love's best hope in brute blindness and blood.
Police Patchwork.

LEAVE AND LICENCE.
SOME years ago, the Metropolitan Board
of Works, acting for the Ratepayers of
London, became the owners of the Pave-
ilion Music Hall at the top of the Gay-
market, which, last week, by“ a nice
derangement” of paragraphs, we were made
to represent as situated near the “ Oxford,"
instead of where it is ; i. e., close to the
“ Argyll-Trocadero" just round the corner
of Windmill Street. The protectionist
policy of the Meddlevex Magistrates, who
create and maintain monopolies in Casinos
and Music Halls, gave such a fancy value
to this brilliant establishment, that the
Ratepayers had to pay more than $100,000
for the goodwill and premises-the “good-
will ” possibly including some magisterial
favouritism, the adoration of 'ARRIES and
the Gaymarketers, and the not wholly dis-
interested patronage of the Don't-C. Divi-
sion of Police. The building was bought by
the Metropolitan Board of Works for the
purpose of demolition, and immediately let
at a rental which produces from six to
seven per cent. on the purchase-money.
Protected on all sides by Police, Magis-
trates, and Parochial Organisations, it can
scarcely be wondered at that the Pave-ilion
adds liberty to its licence--like the Oxford,
it is licensed for music, not dancing--and that
singers use it as the forcing-ground for songs
not much better than those of the old Coal
Hole and Cider Cellars. In the old days, songs
of the kind that roused Colonel Newcome's
just indignation were kept for the ears of
men only, who sought them at very late
hours in not very accessible places ; now
weaker specimens with a similar tendency
are thrust under the noses of those who
choose to pay through them for the enter-
tainment, with all the aids of gas and
electric light, in one of the chief thorough-
fares of London, and sung to a very mixed
audience. The wonder is, not that the Clerk-
enwell Bench should swallow this camel while
they are straining, or professing to strain,
at a lot of insignificant gnats, but that
respectable Ratepayers should sit contented,
and receive profits, as the Landlords of the
London Pave-ilion.

OUR BRASS FARTHING NOVEL SERIES.
{[(By One of Our Own Penny-a-Line Regiment.)
DEAR MR. EDITOR,
“NOTHING new under the sun"? Pooh! Miss BRADDON
has inaugurated a new literary era. “Art long"? Bah! Miss
BRADDON has boiled down Ivanhoe into thirty-two pages. Immortal
works of fiction pulped down into compact pennyworths !!! 'Tis an
Inspiration!
But, thirty-two pages for a penny! Bah! I can do any one of
'em from Scott to Hugo in half the bulk at a quarter of the price,
and even then Miss B. won't be in it with me. Hers is Scott and
Lot!
Sir! Give me a penny-or rather a farthing-for my thoughts,
and I'll astonish you. Miss BRADDON began-I believe-with
Ivanhoe. Well, I shall in the first place just show her how the
work ought to have been done. Then I shall mangle and compress
one of her own novels, and see how she likes the process. So
here goes for-
IVANHOE.
CEDRIC of Rotherwood loved plain Saxon. His son, Wilful
WILFRID of Ivanhoe, loved the Beautiful Saxon. The Beautiful
Saxon, ROWENA, that pink of Saxon propriety, loved Wilful
WILFRID-in a purely pink-of-propriety spirit. The Lovely
Semite, REBECCA, also loved Wilful WILFRID,—under the rose. The
Bad Templar, BRIAN DE Bois-GUILBERT, first lightly fancied the
Saxon Pink-which led to the breaking of lances at Ashby-de-la-
BOULD
Zouche. His affections subsequently settled on the Jewish Rose-
which led to the breaking of vows at Templestowe. (Smaller
pieces in the game “understood.” Also much humorous inter-
lude and picturesque description which are mere padding.) The

You are not made of bran and wood,
Miss Goldenhair!

And passing fair.

With soda wash your hair each week,
And black your eyes,
And strive to look like dolls who speak?
It is not wise!

HONOUR AMONGST THIEVES.
In some respects it is a pity that the Lord Mayor of
Dublin gave his casting vote against conferring the
Freedom of the City upon Mr. PARNELL and some of his
accomplices. It would have been a pretty compliment
to the advocates of sugared-robbery, if that freedom had
been presented to them with a suitable inscription en-
graved upon a pair of handcuffs. One kind of freedom
the Corporation of Dublin will never be able to confer
upon the No-Renters-the freedom to conspire against
the rights of property, and the inviolability of contracts.
In the Dublin Corporation there are doubtless many
tradesmen who would howl considerably if any No-
Renter changed his front, and preached the doctrine of
No Bakers', Butchers', or Tailors' Bills. Perhaps the
twenty-three who voted for the deification of the No-
Renters will think of this ?

And now things may be said to have arrived at a crisis. But the

to call to mind the explicit language of the Code under the heading,
“Temper.” This, he must preserve at all hazards, remembering,
not only that "for bearance and moderation will always be understood

authorities,” but that “idle and silly remarks are unworthy of
notice.” As it is possible, that after a severe struggle, in which,
however, no “ unnecessary violence” ought to have been used, the

Though a star declining,
Yet once more of dining
Ere I go.

And next morn's rising sun

And speaking after eating,

HOME, SWEET HOME!
Modern Version.
'Misst mansions and palaces worthy of Rome,
How pleasant, great BUMBLE, is Poverty's home!
Gehenna-like gloom seems to circle us there,
Which, seek through the world, is scarce met with elsewhere.
Foul fume as from Styx seems to hang o'er the spot,
Its gutters that reek and its rafters that rot,
Its rain-sodden dwellings that threaten to fall,
And its squalid, sad denizens, drearer than all.
Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home!
As ruled by King BUMBLE, a sweet place is Home!
Each garret-roof covers its horde-though it leaks,
Each cellar slough hides its pale crowd-though it reeks.
Dumb thralls, voiceless victims, none heeds their mute call ;
But Dirt and Disease are the masters of all.
Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home!
As ruled by King BUMBLE, a sweet place is Home!
Hence Mammon draws tithe, and here Moloch takes toll;
Here conscienceless wealth, of the spiderish soul,
Sucks fatness from foulness in fætid beast-lairs ;
Whilst somnolent BUMBLE, as deaf to all pray'rs
As a drowsing King Log, all his powers lets fall,
And skulks in prone impotence. What though they crawl
From their dens to his knees, the poor souls, in appeal?
His brains are of wool, and his heart is of steel.
Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home!
As ruled by King BUMBLE, a sweet place is Home!
Deaf, blind to all pleas sense or feeling can urge,
Till King Pest, with his fierce, indiscriminate scourge,
Sallies forth from the loathsome, the horrible lair,
That himself and his imps with our pariahs share.
Then, who so affrighted, so helpless as he,.
King Log, brainless BUMBLE? Ah! when shall we see
Some stout modern ghoul-slaying Champion come
To teach our poor outcasts the meaning of Home?
Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home!
As ruled by King BUMBLE, a sweet place is Home!
An outcast from comfort, a bondsman to pain,
The shivering prey of the frost and the rain,
The thrall of King BUMBLE must patiently dwell,
Midst scenes that might fit the grim Florentine's Hell.
Foul garbage-choked footways snake on through the slum,
Where the sweet airs of heaven seem never to come,
Where a bird shuns to 'light, where a flower ne'er waves ;
Where the grass will not grow, though it grows amidst graves.
Home, Home, Sweet, Sweet Home!
As ruled by King BUMBLE, a sweet place is Home!
Close-stacked, crazy rookeries, rotting and rank,
Pest-pregnant, plague-foul in each timber and plank,
Rear thick-huddled frontages, row upon row,
The smoke-pall above, and the swamp-ooze below.
MRS. RAMSBOTHAM wants to know whether the inhabitants of t

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
regarding my sacred Sword, of a most profane and sceptical charac-
ter, and instead of its inspiring awe, it seemed to beget contempt.
Even my quaint bear-skin head-dress, whose antiquity should have
inspired respect, was the cause of ridicule, and I was asked who
was my hatter, and why I didn't take my muff from off my head
and warm my poor hands with it.
0. C. And how was it with you, Mr. Mace?
M. B. I can scarcely restrain my indignation when I recall the
contemptible ribaldry with which I was received by an ignorant and
laughing crowd. I sat back to back to my brother officer, but I
could feel that our hearts beat in unison, not with fear, oh no! but
in sympathy at our shameful reception. I was asked if I didn't feel
a little scrouged? How many footmen it took to get me and my
mace into the coach, and how on earth I thought I should ever get
out again? How I liked sitting on the stool of repentance, riding
sideways, and looking out of the door like a great overgrown baby
with a new toy? How much the Mace weighed, whether it smelt
like cinnamon, and what I would take for it?
[He pauses, overcome by his feelings.
0. C. Ah, poor fellow, very sad, very sad. But surely riding to
Westminster and back once a year, cannot be your only or even your
principal duty ?
Both. Oh no, certainly not.
S. B. Among other duties we have to attend Charity Sermons
every Sunday, and set a good example by keeping wide awake. I
have also to keep a Diary of the daily events at the Mansion House.
0. C. That, I should think, would be a rather interesting docu-
ment.
S. B. Very, especially as I keep a copy with my own personal
observations and reflections. I am now in treaty with the Editor of
a popular periodical, for its publication, under the title of “Extracts
from the Diary of a Non-Combatant Sword-Bearer."
0, C. Anything further ?
S. B. I have to consult with the LORD MAYOR as to the costume
to be worn by his Lordship upon state ceremonials, as for instance,
whether he should wear his Violet Robe, or his Scarlet Robe, or his
Velvet Robe, or his State Robe, and when he should wear his Diamond
Star, and above all, when he should wear his Chain of Double S. I
have also to keep him well posted up for all his engagements, and
assist in coaching him up in his speeches upon matters of which he
must almost necessarily be somewhat ignorant, such as Art, Science,
and Literature.
0. C. But if all these matters fall to your share, Mr. Sword, what
can you, Mr. Mace, have to do?
M. B. Me, Sir! why my duties are so numerous, that I have to be
at the Mansion House by ten every morning.

0. C. Poor fellow! And what do you find to do when you get
there?

Dublin Correspondent of the

“A very violent prisoner named
DILLON, a ticket-of-leave man,
was sentenced to-day to fourteen
years' penal servitude, for robbery
with violence by Mr. Baron
Dowse.”
The italics are ours, but the
responsibility for the state-
ment we prefer to leave to the
Times. If it be true, here is
a startling illustration of the
way justice is administered in
Ireland. That DILLON was
very violent and a ticket-of-

which certainly tell against
him. But they do not seem to
justify his being condemned
to fourteen years' penal servi-
tude because Mr. Baron DoWSE

LAYS OF A LAZY MINSTREL.
BRIGHTON IN NOVEMBER.
COME down to Brighton ! Leave London in hazy time,
Leave it enshrouded in yellow and brown!
Come here and revel in exquisite lazy time,
Jump in the Pullman at once and run down !
Blue is the sky and the sunshine is glorious,
Charged is the air with delicious ozone :
Gay is the cliff and most gentle is Boreas,
Come down at once and recover your “tone!”
Here come the Light Brigade, laughing deliciously,
There is bold Atlas astride on his cob:
The prelate, the poet, the peer adventitiously,
Mingle and meet in the gaily dressed mob.
Fur-coated beauties in carriages roll about,
Can this be November ?—the sun is so hot;
Light a cigar, as we languidly stroll about,
List to the songs of the merry Mascotte !
Here is Mamma looking anxious and serious :
List to the patter of tiny bottines,
Dainty young damsels, whose faces ne'er weary us,
Foolish young maids in the new crinoline!
Angular ladies in gloomy æsthetic coats,
Maudle and dawdle the afternoon through ;
Graceful girlettes in the shortest of petticoats,
Flutter their frills as they walk "two-and-two."
Sit on the Pier, underneath the velarium,
Noddle your head to the tune of the band;
Or, if you please, you may see the Aquarium,
Call if you like at the Ship or the Grand.
Good Doctor Brighton, a mighty magician is,
Healing at once all your ailments and ills;
Take his advice—there no better physician is-
“A blow on the Pier, and a header at BRILL'S ! ”
Here not a trace is, of smoke or of haziness,
Found as we stroll on the Road of the King;
Happy indeed is His Most Serene Laziness,
Happy, but almost too idle to sing !
Were it not so, I would lengthily talk about
People and places- my dear Mr. Punch-
Ev'ryone sees as they lazily walk about,
I've lots more to say, but I must go to lunch !!

FRESH LIGHT
ON CABINET AFFAIRS.
In the telegrams from Cape
Town appears the following
announcement :
" KIMBERLEY is to be lighted
with the Electric Light.”
This is a fresh illustration
of the usage of going from
home to learn news. Perhaps
the intelligence might have
been communicated in a little
more courteous form. It is
rather a familiar way of al-
luding to the Right Honour-
able the Earl of KIMBERLEY,
Secretary of State of the Colo-
nial Department. That, by
the way. Of course we know
that brevity is the soul of
telegrams. The news is the
thing, and if confirmed this is
exceedingly interesting. To
see the Colonial Secretary
moving about the House of
Lords ablaze with Electric
Light, would be quite one of
the incidents of a dull even-
ing next Session. It is doubt-
less merely an experiment, and
if it succeeds, we shall have
all the Cabinet thus illumi-
nated. We suppose the de-
termination taken is an indi-
cation that there is to be no
more gas amongst Ministers,
which would be rather hard
upon Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT.
Otherwise, we might have
here one of those interesting
competitions between Gas and
Electricity, that, like good
words, have been worth much
and cost so little to the Rate-
payers during the last two
years. If Lord KIMBERLEY
is to be rigged out with the
Electric Light, why should not
Lord GRANVILLE be fitted
up with Sugg's London Gas
Burner, and let there be fair
competition between the rival
methods of illumination ?
BISMARCK.
BISMARCK, according to ru-
mour, is again threatening to
resign, but probably he will
think better of his determina-
tion. Germany is quite as
necessary to BISMARCK as Brs-
MARCK is to Germany. He
is like the late Duke of WEL-
LINGTON, an excellent fighting
Minister, but not so excellent
on questions of domestic legis-
lation. His resignation would
probably be accepted with
resignation. Germany wants
rest, and time to accumulate
capital. Her effective bat
costly military system has left
her one of the poorest nations
in the world. If BISMARCK
studied the rudiments of eco-
nomic science, he would know
that you cannot send the pick
of your industrial population
into the field, without losing
all that population would have
produced during the term of
campaigning, to say nothing
of the cost of clothing, feed-
ing, &c. If you send out a
million of men, whose average
individual power of produc-
tion is equal to £300 a year,
this gives you three hundred
millions a year as the dead
weight of your Army. No
wonder the French indemnity
failed to fill such a hole as
this, or that the Germans are
somewhat discontented.

THEORETIKOS.
BY OSCURO WILDEGOOSE.
(Put into plain English for the benefit of Philistia.)
This mighty Empire seems in a bad way!
Of all that may a languorous bard delight
Our little Island is deserted, quite.
What now is left Me, but the moon to bay?
Loll on the hills, and cry, “Oh, lackaday!”?
Who prates of Progress ? Oh, come out of it,
My most superior Soul! Thou art not fit
For virile conflict or for manly play,
The Forum's toil, the labours of the Mart.
Nasty rude people rage with impudent cries
Against the worship of dead centuries.
It mars my calm! In dreams of moony Art
And maudlin Cultchaw I will stand apart,
Since Providence proceeds not as I please !
A Hint for the Not-At-Home-Office.
If the Seldom-at-Home Secretary would spare Mr.
HOWARD VINCENT for a few months' residence in
America, he might spend his time more profitably than
he has lately done, by learning his business. The capture
of WELLES, the man who tried to “blackmail" JAY
Gould, is a case in point. By clearing every letter-box
in a certain district, putting on two hundred Detectives,
one at each box, and arresting the first person who posted
a letter to JAY GOULD, they caught their WELLES.

more incongruously ghastly. The discoloration of ages seemed to
have settled on its six-months'-old face. There appeared to be a wild
inconsistency between its untoned crudeness and its crumbling
dilapidation. The eye of a scrutinising observer might have dis-
covered a barely perceptible fissure-wider in no part than a couple
of inches, or so—which, extending from the pretentiously ornate
roof, made its way down the wall, in a zigzag direction, until it
became lost in the mangy turf of the diminutive fore-court.

Upon my entrance, CRUSHER arose from his arm-chair with a
gingerly caution and hesitation which at first made me doubtful of
my welcome. But I soon found that the reason of his tiptoe trepi-
dation of manner was--not inhospitality. The man had, for reasons
I could not yet divine, got into so mysteriously nervous a condition
that he was, literally, afraid to move. To an anomalous species of
terror I found him a bounden slave. “I shall perish,” said he ; “I
must perish in this deplorable folly. Thus, thus, and not otherwise,
shall I be lost!” “What the deuce do you mean, old fellow ?”
said I with unromantic directness of speech, and stamping my foot
with a certain instinctive impatience of his morbid poltroonery. A
singular sound-hollow, ghostly, vague, vault-like, all-permeating,
nowhere-everywhereish-was the only answer to my petulant inquiry.
It made even me feel uncomfortable.

CRUSHER had grown mysteriously like unto his house. Its
physique seemed to have interpenetrated his, and to have wrought
a kindred change upon the morale of his existence. His complexion
had the aspect of unbaked dough kept till it had got musty-like
that of the house. He seemed all creaks, cracks, and crevices-like
the house. He seemed dull, dingy, tremulously senile, and prema-
turely paralytic-again like the house. “A nice time I'm going to
have of it in this dreary abode, with this dismal hypochondriac !”
thought I.
Our books-the books which for months had formed no small por-
tion of the mental existence of the invalid-were, as might be
supposed, in strict keeping with the circumstances. We pored
together over such works as Mudd on Bricks and Mortar, Juggins's
Jerry-builder's Guide, and Diddlem's District-Surveyor's Vade
Mecum. I was indescribably bored, but also enlightened somewhat,
both as to the genesis and character of my poor friend's malady, and
what I may call the “Mysteries of Stuccopolis.” In fact, I began
better to understand the case, both from a mental and a tenemental
point of view.

A CERTAIN Mr. W. ROBSON,

from being allowed to go too

facts being vouched for by a

defendant said if the cow
were milked it would spoil
the market. Several witnesses
were called to prove the
cruelty, though others testified
that there had been none,
notably a gentleman who had
been convicted of a similar
offence, and therefore was, no
doubt, a judge of such mat-

(After “ Neckan”-a reckless, neck-or-nothing attempt.)
In summer, in Sky-Limbo,
And the D. T.'s "young lions” mocks, Beside the pool sat NECKLONG,
High o'er PHILISTIA's throng,
Whose roars to him are brays.
Tears filled his soft blue eye ;..
Sits NECKLONG with his harp of gold,
On his slow mule, across the bridge,
And thrums a dismal song.
Pooh-pooheth all the Parties, .
The Philistine rode by.
Their fuss and fi-fo-fum,
Thick herds, beneath Sky-Limbo,
And twitteth their small tweedledee,
“Why sitt'st thou there, O NECKLONG,

And smaller tweedledum.
And thrumm'st thy harp of gold?
And there Gath's shallow singers chaunt

But finical and cold.

And how the Church's shibboleths

Pure Reason doth deride.

They have no other tale.

The Philistine rode onwards,
But NECKLONG, in Sky-Limbo,

And vanished with his mule ;
Soft pipes a sombre stave,
“No cultured mate have I.”
And NECKLONG, in the twilight grey,
Sweetness and Light inspire his lay,
Wept on into the pool.
Bland taste and manners suave.
How if that fed on Sweetness,
Exposed to Light's soft rain,
He wept: “This earthly blindness
He chaffs the swell Barbarian,
Even the Philistine himself
Would shame the burrowing moles.
He chides the stolid clown,

He sings how on an evening,
All Summer, in Sky-Limbo,
Beneath the willows cool,
Above PHILISTIA's throng,
Upon the middle classes
He sat and thrummed upon his harp,
His feather-flai] he lays,
Sits NECKLONG with his harp of gold,
And wept into the pool.
And pipes this plaintive song.

With the peacock's plumes I love,
And the dado's dark below,
And the frieze is faint above:
I have decked my dim rich bower
In the last sweet style of Art;
With pale plates in a row
I have made my chamber smart!

On the waxed, the matted floor;
The convex mirrors gleam,
The horse-cloth drapes the door.

HELEN OF WALDECK.
A Song for the Royal Betrothal.
HELEN of Waldeck! Say what rhyme
Best may hymn the betrothal time.
Once a Prince, in fortunate hour,
Came to woo at Arolsen tower ;
Wooed and won, and then rode away,
Leaving his love behind, men say.
Princess HELENA, fast you hold
All the heart of our LEOPOLD!
HELEN of Waldeck! Thou hast won
England's cultured and student son ;
His the part that his father took,
Earnest ever at desk and book ;
His to rule with an eager heart
Over the wide domain of Art;
Thine to aid like a loyal wife,
All that's best in a husband's life.
HELEN of Waldeck! When our strand
Welcomes thee from the Fatherland,
When all the last farewells have rung
On thine ears in the Teuton tongue,
Trust us, thou wilt never repine
Leaving the land of haunted Rhine.
Here is a greeting, frank and free,
Waiting thee, Princess, over sea!

Shylock, to the correctness of which the London critics, who are
specially adapted to the appreciation of my impersonations, have
testified in a manner which will reflect lasting credit upon the
keenness of their artistic perception. This view of Shylock has,
moreover, the merit of being the one which SHAKSPEARE himself

THE COURT OF RHADAMANTHUS.
(A very long way after Virgil.)
THESE are the realms of unrelenting Fate,
And awful Rhadamanthus rules the State,
Sitting in banco, firm as free of fuss,
With rigid Minos and stern Æacus.
Tremendous triad! Terror of all those,
How high soe'er each may have held his nose,
Who trifle with corruption, striking awe
Into all backstair breakers of the law.
They hear, they judge each hole-and-corner crime,
Inquire into the manner, place, and time:
The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,
Loth to confess, unable to conceal.
Nay, though by custom brazened and made blunt,
And bold long-blinking Justice to affront,
Is made to fear the bandaged One, and feel
There's more than menace in her lifted steel.
Long has the Briber bribed with placid glee,
Assured of silence or indemnity
For rank corruption, deemed a peccadillo;
But now, on many a soft and well-stuffed pillow,
Uneasy lies the head that e'er a crown
To bribe a beer-mused rough or cloddy clown
Has slipped or passed, upon some fair pretence
Of friendship or “legitimate expense.'
Alas! what wonder Party-hacks look glum,
When even that divine Palladium,
Respectability, has lost its charm,
And denizens of higdom“ get it warm”!
Shrink at the fateful Rhadamanthine nod,
And pass to hard, unmitigated “ quod”!
Ask EDWARDS, deft Solicitor of Deal,
What Law's smart servitors, when Law-lashed, feel:
Ask Olds, of Sandwich, how the prison-door
Looks, from within, to a Town-Councillor :
Question the Macclesfieldian May and Main,
How nine months' chokee suits that pleasant pair:
They bow their heads, we'll hope a blush to hide,
And ghostlike from that dread tribunal glide.
Thanks, Minos, thanks, grim Æacus, and thanks,
Stern Rhadamanthus; so the swelling ranks
Of cynical Corruption shall be thinned,
So smart delinquents, who securely sinned,
In chuckling confidence, shall know the State
Flagitious greed will soundly flagellate;
That when Respectability goes wrong,
Broadcloth and beaver will not stay the thong.
Stern lesson to the luckless culprit few,
And to the many a grim warning too.
Law down upon the dirtiest of frauds !
The Public's pleased and PUNCHIUS applauds.

“ It is now definitely understood that CETEWAYO will visit England in the

How will he come to us? What will he say to us?
Who is to board him, and who is to pay ?
Will he for Kingdom and Liberty pray to us,
And dine on raw dog in his primitive way?
Will he revel in parties, receptions, and gaieties,
Inspect a red " Impi" on Aldershot Downs ?
Help at the Boat-race, and found a new hospital ?
Call on Sir BARTLE, and then ride to hounds ?
Shall we lodge him in Newgate ? or feast him at CLARIDGE'S ?
Guard him with “Bobbies," or let him walk free?
Shall we drive him in one of Her Majesty's carriages ?
What, as a fact, is his status to be?
Will he go to the Tower, and “eat up" the Beefeaters,
Do the Aquarium, and lunch on the crowd ?
Star as a lion in black inexpressibles,
Visit the Opera, and there yawn aloud ?
Will he stand for a Borough ? And what are his politics ?
Does he belong to the “Radical Tail” ?
Has he heard of our RANDOLPH ? Prefers he our CHAMBERLAIN ?
What are his views on the right of Free Sale ?

MY DEAR AND HONOURED PARENTS,
For not having taken the prize in "sudden apology" busi-
ness, thus, rather than as “Lady and Gentleman," I am proud to
address you. I say proud, for, as you know, my special training at
this establishment has been, by your desire, not directed to the
cultivation of that high-class Comedy which engenders a respectful
filial bearing in the true Walking Gentleman. No, my dear Parents,
instead of consigning me to the Royal Navy, the House of Commons,
or the Bar, I am grateful to you for your determination that I shall
bring what credit I can to the family in after-life as a Harlequin.
And I do not think you will be disappointed. The way in which at
last examination, I jumped through a publichouse window, and
returned with a double roll instantly through a play-bill underneath
has, I am glad to say, won me the approbation of the whole profes-
sional staff, and, in short, secured me the University Scholarship.
But while having carried everything before me in my particular
line, I have taken a good position in secondary subjects. Should the
taste for pantomime decline, I think that my knowledge of a rally

Then he pleaded his cause. He briefly sketched his
life. He told her how, as a boy, he had been to Eton.
How he had engaged in many a game of football (see
Illustration), and had often played at cricket. He
laughed at the recollection of his many mishaps, but
grew graver as he pictured the gathering of the
scholars in the chapel on Sundays (see Illustration).
Then he told her how he had entered at Oxford, how
fond he had been of walking in Christ Church Meadows
during Commemoration (see Illustration), and how he
had managed each term to get a few days in town, by
entering at an Inn of Court, and eating his dinners at
Lincoln's Inn (see Illustration). When he left Oxford
he told her he had taken a trip abroad. The passage
between Dover and Calais had been rough (see Illustra-
tion). But he soon forgot the terrors of the vasty deep,
when he found himself seated at an al fresco café
chantant in the Champs Elysées (see Illustration). Then
he told her of his trip to India. He explained to her
how fond he had been of “big game.” He had once, he
said, been nearly killed by a tiger (see Illustration).
Finally he declared that he had loved her from the
moment he had first seen her standing apart from the
giddy throng on Ramsgate Sands (see Illustration), and
again asked her to become his wife, with an earnestness
that caused him to tremble in every limb with emotion.
“Before I answer you,” she replied blushingly, “I
think we should exchange confidences.” Then she told
him how she had, as a little girl, been to a juvenile
party in fancy dress (see Illustration).

told him how she had never gone to school, but had been
educated at home by governesses, how fond she had been
of Lawn Tennis in the summer (see Illustration), and
how she had always decorated the village church with
evergreens, with the assistance of the youngest of the

WHO KILLED COCK PIGEON ?
THOSE who journeyed to Little Chickenden yesterday,
in anticipation of witnessing the long-expected match
between Dr. CUTTER and Mr. DoorT HURTLEY, did so in
miserable weather. This was much to be regretted, as the
match between these magnificent pigeon-shots was looked
forward to with immense interest by a number of
pigeons. Those, however, who braved the elements were
rewarded by one of the finest and manliest contests on
record. We noticed among those present at this almost
historic tournament, Cabinet Ministers, Bishops, Diplo-
matists, all the leading members of the Society for
Suppressing Cruelty, and most of our eminent philanthro-
pists, who had been attracted by the placards promising
"A Happy Day at Little Chickenden.” Unfortunately,

The "sport"-for a contest involving such an amount
of fatigue and actual danger amply justifies that title
being applied to it-was happily free from all mercenary
considerations. It was pure, manly, legitimate “sport,”
and "nothing but it," as Mr. Samuel Weller once
remarked on a different occasion. The mere fact that
£500 a-side was thrown in, does not in any way alter the
real character of the proceedings, or assimilate them
in the slightest degree to a trial of skill for a wager.
All, we are glad to say, went merry as a Passing Bell,
and gave universal satisfaction, especially to the pigeons.
Mr. C-L-M and the Archbishop of C-NT-RB-RY kindly
consented to act as referees in case of any dispute arising,
but, fortunately, their services were not required.
Exactly at 12:45 a commencement was made to an
accompaniment of a flourish of trumpets and a salvo
of artillery. Mr. Doort HURTLEY led off with a very

Sophie (after hearing about Frank). “I DECLARE I SHALL NOT BELIEVE A WORD A MAN SAYS TO ME. THEY 'RE ALL LIARS !”
Beatrice. “ FOR SHAME, SOPHIE !” Sophie (regretfully). “AT LEAST ALL THE NICE ONES ARE!”
The loud anguish of that race
With pity paled my cheek. What here avails,
Our utmost wisdom,—we so alien,
So execrated o'en by those whose debt
To us but moves fresh hate, who wrongfully
With blame requite us, and with evil word?
THE IRISH “INFERNO.”
Dream of a Perplexed Premier, after long pondering over the pages
of the grim Florentine.
In the mid-hours of Night, when visions throng,
I found me in a Mournful Isle, astray
Where no path lightwards led: and e'en to tell
It were unwelcome task, how savage wild
That region, how distressed and desolate,
Which only to remember doth renew
In waking thought the bitterness of sleep.
There had been little respite to the care
That in my heart's recesses deep had dwelt
All that long Session perilously pass'd ;
And as a man with difficult short breath,
Forespent with struggle, 'scaped from sea to 'shore,
Upon the unknown land before him stands
At gaze; e'en so my spirit, that failed not
When conflict called it, turned to view the straits
Whereto long toil had brought me.
My leader stay'd, and something wanly smiled,
A smile of many meanings, which, to me,
Though wordless he the while, seemed eloquent
Of mingled memories : Of historic hate
Unwisely fostered, and of secular wrong
Blindly inflicted, borne impatiently,
And vengefully remembered : Of the tongues
Of poisoned strife-engenderers' stirring wrath,
In souls dark moving 'neath the dual curse
Of ignorance and suffering. And I gazed
With will-dividing thought on the wild rout
Of wicked strife and fierce contention, sprung
From error's dragon-teeth, by long dead hands
Assiduously sown.-A woeful sight
To darken Hope's clear eyes in anger stern,
And urge mild Patience to the penal stroke.
Mad hate and skulking malice ; murder armed
Against the helpless, Cruelty a-grin
With unchecked triumph and impunity;
Law mocked, evaded, spurned ; Justice quite thrust
From the fray's forefront, gaoled Sedition lord
And throned Authority helpless!
O blind lust!
O foolish wrath ! that so does goad them on,
In spite of reason's ban and in despite
Of pity's bounty and remedial aid.
What though old wrong yet rankles, what though greed
Of dead despoilers leaves bad legacy
Of bitterness ? Should living love be spurned,
And instant justice flouted, the long toil
Of the past-hampered present set at nought,
On my way
My pale Guide led me, far from air serene,
Into a climate ever vexed with storms.
“All hope abandon ye who enter here"
Seemed its fit welcoming. Conflicting tongues,
Outcries of injury, and wails of woe,
Accents of anger, voices harsh and hoarse,
Made up a tumult that for ever whirls
In that wild region.
Then I question made
Of my grave Guide: “What doth aggrieve them thus,
That they complain so loud ?" He straight replied :
“ Wild hopes long entertained, and their blind life
So poorly passing, that all other lots
They envy."

eccentric genius which shone on the border-land 'twixt tragedy
and comedy, and which, being neither the one nor the other, was,
in reality, the very quintessence of unconscious burlesque. He was
perpetually taking his audience by surprise, always startling but
never disappointing their expectation, for the simple reason that
they never knew what next to expect.

Desmarets (pronounced De Marry or De Murry, so that had Mrs.
RAMSBOTHAM been describing him she might easily have fallen into
the mistake of supposing him to have been connected with the pub-

was doubtless written expressly for Robson, and, therefore, as one
of that actor's “creations” carries with it a Robsonian tradition by
which it is almost impossible for an Actor not to feel himself fettered.
By the way, the expression “ created ” in such a case as this of
Desmarets can only be truly applied to the combined efforts of both

least expected, and frighten Paul-Penn-Pry-Macmillan de Murray

However, the end of the Act arrived, the Sarcophagus lid wasn't
opened, and the Long-expected Bogie did not appear. A great
mistake: the piece should have been re-constructed for this effect,
and the Lime-light turned on.
Mr. PINERO is capital as the niminy-piminy fool, though perhaps

Since the prorogation the Hon. Member has conferred a fresh

him. At the meetings of Ministers, various suggestions were offered.

another that he should be appointed resident Minister of the Gold

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ST. THOMAS'S DAY IN THE CITY.
MR. PUNCH received last week a formidable-looking
document, signed by Field-Marshal PONTIFEX MAXIMUS,
requiring him, by virtue of a precept received from the
Right Honourable the LORD Mayor by the Worshipful
JAMES FIGGINS, Esq., Alderman, to make his personal
appearance on the 21st of December at the Sessions
House, Old Bailey, and “Hereof he was not to fail !”
As Mr. Punch's personal appearance is somewhat
striking, and not usually seen at such places as the Old
Bailey, although his historical association with the Jack
Ketch of a former period is well known, he naturally
hesitated to obey the somewhat peremptory mandate in
question; but not knowing what penal consequences might
attend his absence, he went.
One of the important matters in which he took part
was the election of no less than six Ward Beadles; and
as these expectant BUMBLES were arrayed in the gor-
geous robes of their useful and important office, the effect
upon his unaccustomed eyes was of course somewhat
bewildering.
The Court was densely crowded, and the excitement
and uproar something to remember, when twenty respect-
able, but not strikingly intelligent-looking Gentlemen,
were proposed for the Office of Common Councilman, from
whom sixteen were to be elected.
The chaff and fun were fast and furious, especially
when one rash man ventured to state that one of the new
Candidates was not coming to the Election “through a
sea of Champagne !” but upon the whole the scene was
not particularly interesting, except as a memorial of the
bad old times before the Ballot deprived Elections else-
where of their rough and somewhat brutal character, and
Mr. Punch returned to his hospitable dwelling neither
a wiser nor, of course, a better man, but wondering how
much longer the Corporation Elections would be allowed
to continue merely as examples of what to avoid.

That we met with SCARY BLAINE,
As the propounder of a pen-and-ink policy of exag-

awfully silly,
And as vaunting as it was vain.
If anybody (not a Yankee) should take the most
unwarrantable liberty of " complicating” the
virginal purity of "Peruvian questions" with
those adulterate devilries known as “Euro-

Why, Creation would "bust,” said SCARY,
Which plainly proves that the great Clock of Time to

But fare thee well, oh! SCARY BLAINE !
