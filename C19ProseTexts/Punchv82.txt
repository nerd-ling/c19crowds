g- ORE light!" said MR. PUNCH, with a luminous look at Bismarck.
The bold eyes of the burly Prince blinked momentarily before that radiant regard.
“The Wonder of Weimar might have been gratified by this Show,” said he, grimly.
“Humph!" exclaimed the Wonder of Fleet Street—and the World—doubtfully.
“My Storage of Force, now,” continued the stalwart Teuton, “would have opened his eyes a little. After all,
Philosophers are an owlish lot. They struggle after light—so they say—We strike it !”
“On their (knowledge) boxes," subjoined the Sage, smilingly. “Blood and Iron are a blundering brace of overgrown,
one-eyed Titans, unilluminated by Geist. You swear by the twin giant gaolers, STRENGTH and Force. I back, in the long
run, the patient PROMETHEUs.”
“Ah, he bided his time," muttered DE FREycINET, meditatively.
“As you and GRANVIIIE are doing out Egypt-way, eh?” chuckled the Prince, sardonically. “The Forty Centuries
—still perched, I suppose, on the Pyramids, where NAPOLEoN planted them—will get tired of watching your little
game."
“The Forty Centuries can indulge in forty winks,” said the Ever-Ready, himself indulging in one. “After so
long a vigil, it will be quite excusable; and they've been so eternally trotted out by the trope-mongers, that they're getting
as great a nuisance as the Skeleton at the Egyptian Feast itself."
“Do you find your Force-Storage system cheap, Prince 2" inquired GRANVILLE, with suave simplicity.
“I say, isn't your Economic Light going out?” counter-queried the German, with grave soli itu le.
“Seems burning a bit low, indeed,” said Abdul HAMID, slily, “Accumulator wants seeing to, perhaps. Can I be
of any service?"
“Why, really,” said BIsMARCK, “to dispel Egyptian darkness requires a somewhat more decided Flamer than
“To light one's Tobacco in half a gale of Opposition wind, eh, Prince 2" interjected the Sage, smoothly. “Let him
put that in his pipe 1" he added, aside, to the gratified GRANVILLE.
The Prince made a vicious lunge at Toby, who had struck up an impromptu friendship with the Iron One's huge
hound. But the Dog of Dogs, adroit and imperturbable as his Master, quietly wheeling, let the big boot fly bootlessly, and
wagged his abbreviated tail with a confidential canine waggishness, which his colossal chum evidently appreciated highly.
“‘Love me, love my dog,' Prince,” said the all-seeing Sage, significantly, and the big Teuton blushed as beet-rootily
as though he had been caught plying a pea-shooter from behind the SULTAN's back.
“What do you think, now, of my ‘New Northern Light'?” asked DE GIERs, anxiously. “JABLochRoFF not in
it, eh?”
“Well, let's hope it'll prove an improvement upon the MELIkoff Million-Candle failure, anyhow,” said MR. PUNCH.
“Look here,” grumbled MAxcINI; “don't you fellows forget my share in the Exhibition.”

—
“Ob, certainly not; only don't make an exhibition—of yourself, my dear MANCINI," remarked the World's Mentor,
mildly. “There are “lesser lights,' you know, eh, SAGASTA?”
“Precisely," interposed the Austrian Exhibitor, with conviction. “Now, my duplex system, as I'll explain --
“Never explain anything,” interrupted BISMARCK, brusquely, the big boot landing heavily on the Austrian's smartly-
shod toe.
“Exactly,” said MR. PUNCH, drily. “An Oracle who goes about explaining himself will soon lose prestige.”
“That,” said DE FREYCINET, “is Obscurantism, and we are all Illuminati here.”
“Oh, are you?" quoth the Sage, sardonically. “What do you think, Toby ?”
Toby gave an intelligent snap, sharp and keen as an electric spark, and “pointed" in the direction of his Master's as
yet hidden “exhibit,” his nose steady as the Three per Cents, ald his tail as rigid as a ramrod.
“Gentlemen,” said the Sage, calmly, “you are not Illuminati—yet, but you shall be, presently. Bless your benighted
souls, you don't know what Light is, till you've seen—what you shall see, anon. Don't scowl, BisMARCK ; and, GRANville,
you needn't chuckle. I've a Light here that'll take the shine out of the lot of you. Prince, your Incandescent Lamp is
an expensive sputterer that gives out more heat than light; and your Arctic Arc, my dear DE GIERs, if cool, is dim and
uncertain. But here you have realised the supreme desideratum—Brilliancy without Heat!!!—portable, inexpensive, and
entirely devoid of danger—save to duffers and rascals. Bacon's lumen siccum blent with the Bard's
‘Light that never was on sea or shore,’
till Punch, the Modern Prometheus, produced it. An Electric Spark to illuminate the World. Fiat lua / Behold !!”
And as the Sage drew aside the veil, there burst forth a dazzling blaze of soft yet searching radiance, before which
the rival exhibitors blinked owlishly, and the competitive lesser lights paled their ineffectual fires. Toby, with eyes eagle-
wide, yelped the yelp of ecstatic triumph, and his Mirific Master, almost electrified by the sudden outpour of his own stored
effulgence, veiled an eye archly with one liſted hand, as he pointed with the other to where, midmost of the mighty glow,
burned the mystic words—

\
ROBERT ON THE NEW YEAR.
IwunpER how New Year's Days cum for to be inwented and why
they chose such preshus cold weather for the ceremoney. I should
ha’ liked a nicer and warmer time of the year for it, but then of
course we couldn't have had no Chrismas cards and no Chrismas
pudden with it.
Another werry important antiqueerian question is, why is every-
body as is anybody obligated to eat no end of Turkeys just about
this time, till I'm sure us poor Waiters is sick of the werry site of
one? However leaving these important questions for consideration
by the Geological Society and such like Fellows, let us consider what
sort of year we are about to have in this the grandest City of the
World, as I hears my Patrons call it about twice a week. Well
then, to begin with, we’ve got a grand style of Lord Mare, just the
man for the place, as allus Waiters thinks, full grown, full blown,
and full of dignity and importance, and, speakin ; from my own
experience, I can trewly say that, “tho' he dearly loves a Dook he
ne'er forgets the poor”—Waiter. BRown says he’s like a bottle of
60 Port, full bodied, a little dry, and a little crusty, which ain't bad
for Brown.
I heard a friend of theirs say at dinner the other day, that the
first time as they was expected to offshyate on a certain unpleasant
occasion, they receeved a card on which was written Mr. MARwood,
Executioner. Terms, 10 Guineas for One, or 15 Guineas for Two!
so it seems the difference between wholesail and retale exists evenin
our last extremities. It reminds me of the Dentist who charged me
5s, for taking out one of my teeth, and when I said I thought it was
rather high, said if I’d have another out directly he’d charge me
werry low, or he'd make me a large allowance on taking out a
quantity !, I didn't trubble him with my cumpany much longer.
I don't think my friends of the Corporation and the Great Gills
are quite comfortable in regard to the New Year that's just cum,
They seems to think that there’s somthink a Brewing besides Old
Ale, and that's Mischief. In fact they seems summat like the cele-
brated Scotchman, I think his name was DAMALL.gºes or somethink
like it, who used to have a sword hanging up in his bed-room by a
single Hare! Why he did it I can't quite remember, but I suppose
it was to show his friends what a plucky fellow he was, tho' I dessay
he made game of 'em all by taking it down when they'd gone away.
Why anybody should want to interfere with such thoroughly con-
tented people as my patrons is, I can't make out. There’s plenty
of discontented people about, speshally in Ireland, for these reformers
to try their hands upon. en they’ve satisfied them, then will
be the time to try and make them as is quite satisfied with things as
*H are, as dissatisfied as possible with things as is to be.
However, praps one oughtent to be too hard on anyone just at this
time. It’s more a time for pity and kindness and charity, speshully
to the Poor everywhere, whatever their nashunallity, and knowing
what many on 'em has to suffer, let us all, great and small, do what
we can to make them enjoy comferably, cheerfully, and thankfully
a Happy New Year ! Robert.

AIR-" I once had a sweet little Doll, dears.” (Kingsley's Words, set
by A. Cecil.)
I once saw a sweet pretty face, boys:
Its beauty and grace were divine.
And I felt what a swell I should be, boys: .
Could I boast that such charms were all mine !
I wooed. Every man I cut out, boys,
At my head deep anathemas hurled:-
But I said as I walked back from church, boys,
“I’m the luckiest dog in the world !”
As doves in a cot we began, boys,
A gosy and orthodox pair:
Till I found at my notable wife, boys,
The world was beginning to stare.
She liked it. At first, so did I, boys
But, at length, when all over the place
She was sketched, hunted, photo'd and mobbed, boys,
I cried, “Hang her sweet pretty face l’”
Still, we went here and there, right and left, boys;–
We were asked dozens deep, +I say “we,”
Though wherever I went not a soul, boys,
Could have pointed out ADAM from me.
But we had a rare social success, boys,
Got mixed with the noble and great, -
Till one's friends, who say kind and nice things, boys,
Talked of me as “the man come to wait!”
So, I've no more a sweet pretty wife, boys;–
For the one that I once hoped to own,
Belongs, as I've found to my cost, boys,
To the great British public alone.
So until they've got tired of her face, boys,
And a rival more touzled or curled,
Drives her home to her own proper place, boys-
I’m the dullest dull dog in the world!

THE Guardian and Reporter, for December 24, contains an
account of a remarkably lively scene at the meeting of the Holborn

4. PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[JANUARY 7, 1882.
OLD DRURY, GAIETY, AND OTHER SHows.
MR. CAESAR AUGUSTUs HARRIs, Emperor of Old Drury Lane, with
the aid of Pantomime PostIFEx MAXIMUs E. L. BLANCHARD and a
whole College of learned Augurs and talented Assistants, has in
Robinson Crusoe given the world a capital Children's Pantomime.
Mr. ARTHUR
Roberts, as Mrs.
Crusoe, is im-
mensely funny; so
is Mr. JAMES FAwN
as Mr. Timothy
Loveage. Their
duet, “Pou’re no-
thing of the sort,”
will be the vocal
hit of the Panto-
mime.
The only weak
}. in the Drury
ane Pantomime,
on the first night,
was the music,
which had a ten-
dency more to
Wagnerism than
waggishness, and
imparted a solemn
- - kind of religious-
service sort of tune to the slowly-developing, but really splendid
transformation, which is as novel in design as it is both original and
effective in execution. There is one disappointment very generally
felt, and that was that Mr. ABTBUB
Roberts does not sing “We are a Merry
Family,” which he has made so popular.
Mr. John D'AUBAN, as the Chamberlain
to King Hoity-Toity, King of the Cannibal
Islands, is invaluable. No use placing this
Mr. Chamberlain in the Cabinet. Such a
restless, energetic spirit would be the very
man to lead a revolutionary movement,
and to keep it going as long as he had any
go left in himself. Miss EMMA D'AUBAN,
too, is a most expressive pantomimist: she
means so much, and tells it all, plainly,
in action.
There is one great novelty at Old º
this year, and that is a bevy of young an
pretty girls, whose forms set off to the
reatest advantage the dresses designed
or them by Mr. ALFRED THoMPson, who
has also provided the sketches for the very
ingenious properties which occupy, so pro-
minent a place in the grand Trades' Proces-
sion in honour of Crusoe’s safe return to
Old England. A touching spectacle this,
which never entered into DEFoE’s limited imagination.
As Robinson Crusoe, Miss FANNY LESLIE never lets the fun drop
for a moment, and she has to act for herself and partner, Poll
Loreage, as Miss AMALIA, taken for all in all,
and there’s not much of her, is too small and
quiet for the vast stage of Old Drury, and the
boisterous requirements of its Pantomime.
Mr. HARRY NICHOLLs is very funny as Will
Atkins, a character conceived on an old-
fashioned pattern, which has been pretty well
worked threadbare in Nautical Burlesques and
Bab-Ballad Operas. It is not new, but he is
very droll.
We did not recognise Mr. HARRY JACKson as
the Cockatoo: he evidently had some excellent
things to say: but what's the use of the most
telling lines when you’re done up in feathers
with a cockatoo's head on your shoulders, and
your whole attention given to the mechanism
which works your tail and wings?
As Friday, Master CHARLEs, LAURI, showed
- 12, himself first-rate, both as Aerobat and Panto-
% mimist. His really serious pantomime acting
“Will Atkins?”— was worthy of what tradition tells us about
won't Atkins—rather GRIMALDI, Pity there is not more of this,
The Dresden China Ballet, danced by Madam
KATTI LANNER's pupils—they should have danced a Bric-à-brac-
own—is a real treat for the children who look on, and the children
who perform the dance; little mites some of 'em, to whom Drury

start in life to many
who would find their daily bread very difficult to earn were it not for
our great Pantomime Houses, to which, beginning with Old Drury,
Pupils of the Drury Lane-School-Boards,
under the management of CESAR Augustus HARRIs, wenostheartily
wish continued and well-merited prosperity.
The Gaiety.—Walk up ! walk up! and see the third of the
Three-Act Burlesque Series. Aladdin's newsacredlamp of Three-Act
Burlesque takes, the place of the old ones, which it excels in
spectacular brilliancy, though the necessity laid on the Author,
Mr. REECE, for perpetually keeping the ensemble of “all the
talents” before the audience is the “reece'un why” (this with
apologies to Mr., Reece) the simplicity of the old familiar story
is obscured, and its genuine dramatic interest muddled away.
The three hits of the piece are – Aladdin's mother's song
(capitally given by Mr. DAL-
LAs), Miss FARREN's song
and chorus, “I’ll tell your
Mother what you've done.’”
and her Street Arab's song in
the Second Act, in which the
change from real pathos to
thorough-going chick-a-leariness
exhibits a true touch of genius
of the old Robsonian type, and
stampsitat once as certainly one
of the best things this clever
Burlesque actress has ever done.
This combination of song and
dance was vociferously and
deservedly encored three times,
and each repetition was given
with some new effect, showin
that the artiste was heart an
soul in her work. This alone
would be enough to make the
fortune of Aladdin, without
the sayings, doings, and danc-
ings of Miss KATE WAUGHAN
Messrs. TERRY and Royce, an
the rest of the company; but no doubt Lord Chief Justice CodeRIDGE
will be delighted to hear that Miss Connie GILCHRIST comes to the
front a good deal, and that her dancing is thoroughly appreciated
by several of his Lordship's legal brethren in the Orchestra Stalls.
Lyceum.—The Revival of the Two Roses is an instance of the
Survival of the Fittest. Seldom has any character-part been so
perfectly adapted to the peculiarities of an Actor, as is the rôle of
Digby Grant to those of Mr. IRVING, peculiarities which, in some
instances real, in others affected, now developed by experience and
stereotyped by time, make up the professional individuality of
HENRY IRVING. His Digby Grant is a masterpiece, not a “creation,”
for no Actor ever “created” a part unless he was also its Author.

t-
...The character was compounded by Mr. ALBERY-who is nothing
if neither Robertsonian nor Dickensian-apparently from materials
furnished by Mr. Bray in Nicholas }. tleby, whose speeches
indeed read uncommonly like the very words we hear from Digby
Grand-(no, we mean Digby Grant; “ Digby
Grand” being the title of one of WHYTE
MELVILLE's earliest and best novels)—with a
touch of Eccles (who was founded on Costigan)
and a spice of WILKIE Collins's Captain
Wragge, and a flavour, lately added by the
Actor, of Robert Macaire; but as long as
Mr. IRVING is its impersonator, this character
must stand out as the part of the piece, and be
the raison d'être of its ºl. for there
is little else to recommend it except the Comic
Bagman (played by Mr. JAMEs, who is not
“in it” with Mr. GEORGE, HonEy), who is
always talking shop, and who, when he appears
in the last Act as a sort of converted clown,
gives occasion for the utterance of some
witticisms, written in the most questionable
taste, on scriptural phrases, which, if they have
come to be identified with cant, are still abso-
lutely the words of Holy Writ. For this, the
Authoris originally to blame, though on revival
at such atheatre as the Lyceum, for which estab-
- lishment Mr. IRVING appeared at one time
desirous of obtaining high ecclesiastical patronage, we should have
thought he would have insisted on the omission of these decidedly
objectionable jokes, which are, at the best, such very cheap wit.
e Two Roses are very artificial flowers, of the skittish Barmaid
order, and though everything is done by the two young ladies at the
Lyceum, Miss EMERY and Miss MATTHEws, to make them as
ming as possible, barmaids they yet remain-fit mates, how-
ever, for such a couple of conceited prigs as are their two lovers.
..The Stage-Manager has not got over, the absurdities of the
situation in the Second Act, when a big girl
tries to conceal herself behind an eighteen- ---
inch square movable fire-screen, where she
remains palpably within her loyer's line of
sight, and therepetition of a similar absurdity

At this première the representatives of Gush and Guggle, who are

By way of A Joke. IN A THEATRE.
TO THE RIGHT HON. THE LORD MAYOR.
My LoRD, -
ONE of the most important and one of the most interesting
duties attached to the ancient office your Lordship now holds, is that
of Almoner not only to the City of London, but to the whole king-
dom, when any fearful calamity or terrible misfortune, far beyond
the reach of private benevolence, yisits any portion of its people. . .
Your Lordship's predecessors have set a noble example in this
respect, which you are doubtless ready and even º: to follow.
But there has always been one condition attached to all these nume-
rous efforts to alleviate human suffering that has never once been
infringed.
They have always been utterly and entirely free from the smallest
taint of political or sectarian feeling, and, with that understanding,
men of all parties, of all creeds, and of all conditions of life, have
readily and nobly responded to every appeal that has emanated from
the Mansion House—the Treasury, so to speak, of Public Bene-
volence. - -
Forgetful, º of this important fact, your Lordship is
asking for funds for the “Defence of Property in Ireland.” Surely
this is a great departure from the wise course of your predecessors.
The protection of Property in Ireland must be left to the Law, and
the putting of the Law into force to Her Majesty's Government,
and, if they fail, Parliament will shortly meet, and plenty of eager
opponents will be found to denounce them for their incompetency or
timidity, should they be thought deserving of it.
What can Mansion House charity have to do with so important a
political question ?
With all due respect, too, it must strike most people that for the
Lord Mayor of the City of Łondon to interfere in high questions of
Public Policy partakes rather of the nature of burlesque.
Another point arises. Your Lordship is known to be a leadin
member of one of the wealthiest Livery Companies of London, an
it is also known that these Companies possess enormous estates in
Ireland. Are the subscriptions of the benevolent to be solicited to
assist in the Defence of the Property of these wealthy absentee
Landlords?. It will scarcely redound to the credit of the old Qor-
poration if they devote £5,000 of their abundant wealth in aidin
the Landlords of Ireland to enforce with the utmost rigour the crue
and unjust Law of Distress against their poor tenants; and when it
is remembered that more than a quarter of a million of these latter
hold farms of less than sixteen acres each, it is scarcely to be won:
dered at that popular sympathy in Ireland should be much excited
in their favour. -
In the past history of the old Institution of which you are now the
head, it has been written to its honour that it was always tº the fore
struggling and striving to help the serf against his feudal Lord, the
oppressed against the oppressor, free thought against bigotry, and
honest poverty against the insolenge of wealth. It will be a bad day
for that Institution when it loses that proud distinction for the mere
paltry purpose of ºf Landlord º: when the hour of its
OWIl §. arrive. ay your Lordship avoid the snare that has
been laid by no friendly hand, and maintain during your year of
office the wise and discreet course so successfully adopted by your
predecessors. I am, my Lord, Yours obediently,
330±70ſº

WATERLoo is avenged! I º this advisedly, and without prejudice.
By a combination which shall be nameless we won Waterloo, but
there are victories which are as costly as defeats. Cock-a-doodle-do-

best part of a century has elapsed, and at last our time has come.
Providence has introduced the leaden sky into Paris; manufacturin
Fº in and around Paris has introduced the veritable Englis
fog. Mabille (now closed for the season) is more dull and stupid
than the Polytechnic ; English tailors, drapers, and costumiers who
dress the best part of the Parisian public, have planted themselves
in the best part of Paris; and Paris itself is reduced to about a
uarter of a mile of City, from the Grand Hotel to the Vaudeville
Theatre, along which the predominant languages heard are Cockney-
American and American-English. The Boulevard—formerly Des
Italiens—ought to be now called the Jonathan-Bull-vards, and the
English word “Tavern” ought surely to succeed the French word
“Restaurant,” when boiled beef and carrots are wheeled round the
room on a carving-table as they are at “SIMPson's”. The time is
evidently not far distant, when a Menu will be called a “Bill of
Fare,” except in England, and, written, in English, and when the
instructions for a Christmas pudding will be understood by Cooks,
and not sent as a§ to the nearest Apothecary.
There is one istmas dish, however, which has not yet been
acclimatised in Paris, and that is a Pantomime., Attempts have
been made, from time to time, to º the article, but never suc-
cessfully. The drama, in fact, in Paris, has no special Christmas
character. There are comedies and opéras-bouffe, to which Parisians
may or may not take their children, though while the Vie Parisienne
exists as a so-called “family” journal, and is conducted as it is, it
ought surely to be possible to take French children anywhere.
The only special concession to the season is an attempt to dramatise
the whole Arabian Nights; for the tough old Biche aur Bois, which
has been running, more or less, for thirty or forty years, can hardly
be considered as a Christmas offering.
The Thousand and One Nights is a clever attempt to put four
quarts of fiction into a pint Fº In three Acts and thirty-three
Scenes, lasting four hours and a half, a living panorama of all the
rincipal stories in the book we have agreed to call the Arabian
Wights is made to pass, before us. Three of the most wonderful
dramatic stories ever discovered—Sinbad the Sailor, Aladdin, and
the Forty Thieves—have ..º.º. done to them, and the French
dramatist has yet to be born who will find in any one of these pieces
enough for an evening's entertainment. The Countess d’AULN9Y is
treated with more judgment and courtesy. So many years have
elapsed since any “spectacle” worthy of the name has been seen on
the Parisian Stage, that the Thousand and One Nights, fairly
mounted, has become the piece of the day. It is not advertised on
every wall, and in frantic newspaper advertisements, as “a gigantic
success,” and the company engaged are not stated to be the “greatest
combination of talent ever lº together.” At the same time, as
it really possesses the materials of two or three Pantomimes, the
curtain, according to French theatrical custom, falls twice for twelve
or fifteen minutes during the evening. What a good theatrical
custom it is, and how thankful English audiences would be to see it
adopted for English Pantomimes. Another good French custom is
. of keeping the gin-shop out of the theatre. Here praise must

“Immortal Age beside immortal Youth,
And all I was in ashes.”—TITHoNUs.
No. XII.-From Mr. Alderman Chamberlain, (1875), to the Right Hon.
The President of the Board of Trade.
MY DEAR Joe, -
- IT is with a feeling of pardonable pride that I thus fami-
liarly address one in your fi'i position. ... I always felt that I had
a soul above buttons or even screws; and whilst occupying myself
with the municipal
business of Birming-
ham, I kept my eye-
glass fixed upon affairs
of State. By the way,
they tell me you’ve put
away my eyeglass and
taken to spectacles. I
º this is not true.
e got on wonderfully
well with the fºliº
and I don't like dis-
carding old and tried
friends. ... For all we
know, this innocent
appendage may possess
the same qualities as the signet-ring old What's-his-name had in
the days of the Arabian Nights—if your critical mind will pass
that phrase. As long as he wore the ring he prospered exceedingly;
when he lost it everything tumbled to pieces. There was, in short,
a regular Conservative reaction. I wish you had kept to the eye-
glass. . Sentiment apart, it really played an important part in your
oratorial triumphs. Many is the Alderman on the other side who
has shaken in his shoes, when the calm light of the lens has been
turned upon him, and to . a Town Councillor it has been even
as the “burning glass” which naughty boys at school hold over
each other's hands, bringing about acute discomfort.
What a day you are having, to be sure!, I am told that in the
nurseries of eminent Conservatives, they induce early sleep (or at
any rate the *. of repose) in young heirs, by mentionin
our name. To whisper “Chºppºn tº in the ear of for
EDESDALE as he pulls his . teap on, is sure to result in an attack
of nightmare. so, it is said, that a Motion is to be introduced in
the Lords next Session to alter the titles “Lord Chamberlain” and
‘‘Vice Chamberlain” to something less suggestive in the ears of the
Court of undesirable contingencies.
All this is admirable for you, and plays your game in the kindest
possible way. It is a difficult game, especially in the risky way you
#. it, endeavouring to keep your hold on the caucuses, whilst you
emurely sit in the Cabinet. It has done yery well up to now, and
with a cool head and a talent for that sort of thing, you will probably
get along even without the eye-glass. At any rate, you know where
ou are going, which is a great ºf in the journey of life. I
ew it at least seven years ago, when I abandoned trade and took
to politics. A man who aims at the stars is pretty sure, if there is
anything in him, to hit the top of the tree. en I made up
my mind to be Prime Minister you were pretty sure to live to be
President of the Board of Trade. But it seemed even then that
j, years must necessarily elapse before you reached a position
which JoHN BRIGHT attained only in middle age, and at a time when
he had been a generation before the public, and had done a great
work. But here you are a Cabinet Minister at a single bound, and
in your fifth Session in Parliament! That is a great start, and
covers an unexpectedly large tract of ground at the outset. aul
lad to see that this blaze of prosperity has not turned your head.
fact, I think your manner has improved as President of the
Board of Trade, compared with mine when Mayor of Birmingham.
That is a good sign, for it is manner that makes §. man, particularly
the Statesman, to go. It is only a rare phenomenon like GLADSTONE
who can afford to scorn the graces of manner, and the more intimate
becomes your acquaintance with politics, the more plainly you will
see how much he loses and has lost by this failing.
Keep your eye on the pence of your manner, Joseph ; the pounds
of your politics will take care of themselves.
rather dwell on this topic because, knowing my own propensities
I was a little afraid of hearing how you would fail. You might have
been overbearing, self-asserting, in a word, bumptious. On the
contrary, I have heard of your º: even touchingly deferential
in your manner, and that you have learned to assume a meekness
though you have it not.
Proceed thus, dear Joseph, and prosper. Some of the elders amon
your political brethren might dearly love to drop you in a pit, an
go on their way rejoicing in the thought that they would see you
nevermore... They may at some crisis, even succeed. But you will
get out again, and live to put corn in their sacks.
Yours hopefully, Joseph CHAMBERLAIN.
No. XIII. (AND LAST).-From Mr. Stafford Northcote, of the Inner Temple
(1847), to the Right Hon. Sir Stafford Northcote, Bart., M.P.
CHER STAFFY,
FROM my quiet Inn, where I await briefs which have not
yet begun to flowin, I look out on you, standing on the threshold of
a new year, which 1 sincerely trust may be a happier one and a more
prosperous than º you have lately enjoyed. I will take my chance
about the briefs; but tºº. about your career, and what it
has cost you, I certainly would not deliberately choose it. You’ve
missed your way grievously, STAFFY, dear boy, though I am proud
to say there has never been the slightest stain on, our escutcheon
from any act of yours. Politics make a man acquainted with strange
bedfellows, and they have sometimes driven you into shady company.
But }. 've always kept your hands clean, and held your head high.
Where we made the mistake was in sticking to the Tories when
GLADSTONE and some other Peelites like ourselves drifted slowly, but
surely, to the Liberal side. There is nothing of the old Tory about
you, STAFF, and not very much of the Conservative. Hence, living
in the Tory camp, and even a titular leader of Tories, you have been
playing a game at cross purposes. Being frank, and even ingenu-
ous, by nature, you have sometimes blundered in a manner that has
excited the open scorn of RANDOLPH, and the scarcely hidden con-
tumely of CHAPLIN. . Dizzy was even a more advanced Liberal than
you... If he had stuck to the Liberal party when he enrolled him-
self in its ranks fifty years ago, and you had joined it twenty years
later, Dizzy would in these times have ranked as a Radical, and
you have posed as a Whig. As it was, you both stuck to the Tories,
and you know how much better Dizzy managed than you.
The fact is, you labour under a disadvantage, which I trust, and
indeed know, will always be with you. You have a conscience, and
this is always getting you into difficulties. You have an old-
fashioned way of be-
lieving that truth is
truth, whether spoken
in private life or called
for in political conflict.
That's at the bottom
of all your troubles.
In the circumstances in
which you sometimes
find yourself, the in-
fluence of this remark-
able phenomenon lends
to your conduct an
illusive appearance of
indecision. You can't
bear to appear to
desert your friends, or even to give them a lukewarm support.
Still, when RANDoIPH is on the rampage, and all the worst
passions of political animosity are aroused, you cannot forget
that you are an English gentleman, a Statesman of repute, and you
decline to be dragged along, with whatever appearance of triumph,
in the political Carnival. Then, you know, you jump up and walk
out of the House with your head hanging down as if it were you
that had done something of which you were ashamed: a º
which gains weight from the fact that the young bloods of the party
howl at you as you pass. - -
You've tried this once or twice, and I do hope you are now certain
that you might do better. In addition to other disqualifications for
your post, is an unwavering good temper, and a disposition so gentle
that it shrinks from even the slightest appearance of hurting any-
one's feelings. This is all very well, but it may be carried too far ;
and that's the mistake A. make. It's time either that you showe
your authority, or openly confessed you had none. The Conservative
party can look out for itself; but I would emphatically say, from
our point, of view, that the family can't afford to have a repe-
tition of the scenes of last Session. If your courage were equal to
our common-sense and shrewd appreciation of the drift of things,
it would be a happy day for the party you are supposed to lead in
the House of Commons. You gener #. know the right thing to do,
and would do it if you were unfettered. Take off the fetters with
your own hand, dear STAFFORD. They're not nearly so heavy, nor
so tightly welded, as your modesty suggests.
You can do without the Conservative party a great deal better
than they can do without you. You have been misled by the noise
and the antics of the little, Party below the Gangway. If you only
ventured to assert yourself, you would be surprised to find that
underneath this froth there lie depths of appreciation of that quality
of gentlemanhood of which I am Fº to say you’re a type. Try
this on my recommendation, and I’ll undertake to say you’ll never
regret it. Yours with deep sympathy, STAFFORD NoFTHcote.

COCK-ROBIN SHOOTING.
(The Junior Gun Club, Shep-

THE meeting at this Club
yesterday afternoon was fully
attended by members home
for the §§ who showed
some remarkably good form.
Sport commenced with a
couple of 6d. handicap sweep-
stakes, and of these events
Master ATKINs (54 yards rise)
won the first by grassing
three out of four consecu-
tively, and winging the fourth
bird. The second fell to
Master JACKson, after. *:

lew to atoms. The compe-
tition for the Winter Cup,
value 6s. 6d., added to a 4d.
handicap sweepstakes, was
then started, ten young gen-
tlemen entering their names.
In the first round Master
Cooper (9), Master DENNIS
10%), and Master RUGGLES
12), failed to kill their birds,
though they all made their
feathers fly. An exciting finish
resulted in Master WELLs be-
coming the holder of the Cup,
and the winner of 3s. 0}d.;
his score standing 3 kills an
13 hits. The winner of the
principal event shot with a
purchased at the estab-
ishment of Mr. TRIBALLs,

gaining ground that, as a
sport, Cock-Robin shooting de-
cidedly beats Cock-Fighting.

just paid a visit to the Grosve-

she had known WATTs's Hymns

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON
CHARIVARI. [JANUARY 7, 1882.
A RUN WITH THE BARKSHIRE.
(By Dumb Crambo Junior.)
The Hounds soon got on good terms
with the Fox.
And at last Chopped in the Wood.
IN EARNEST.
LET us be clearly understood. The word “Aestheticism” has been perverted
from its original meaning; i.e. the perception of all that is good, pure, and
beautiful in Nature and in Art, and, as now vulgarly applied, it has come
in a slang_sort of way to stand for an effeminate, invertebrate, sensuous,
sentimentally-Christian, but thoroughly Pagan taste in literature and art,
which delights in the idea of the reiscitation of the Great God Pan, in Swin-
burnian songs at their highest fever-pitch, in the mystic ravings of a BLAKE,
the affectation of a RosetTI, the Charmides and revoltingly pan-theistic Rosa
Mystica of OsCAR WILDE, the Songs ºf Passion and, Pain and other similar
mock-hysterical imitations of the “Mighty Masters.” VICTOR Hugo, OUIDA,
Sw1NBURNE, BURNE-Jones, have much to answer for.
This AEstheticism, as it has gradually come to be known, is the reaction
from KINgsley's Muscular Christianity. Exaggerated muscular Christianity,
in its crusade against canting and whining religion, in its bold attempt to show
that the practice of true religion was for men, as well as for women, trampled
on the Christian Lily, emblem of perfect purity; and what Athleticism trod
under foot, Æstheticism picked §. cherished, and then, taking the sign for the
reality, paid to it the extravagant honours of a Pagan devotion; and the worship
of the Lily was substituted for the veneration paid to the sacred character, in
whose hand Christian Art had originally placed it. To this was added the wor-
ship of the Peacock Feather. It is this false AEstheticism which we have per-
sistently attacked, and will persistently attack to the bitter end, and henceforward
those who misunderstand us do so wilfully, and it may be maliciously.
Education in Wales.
If Higher Education is brought to its highest pitch in Wales, and Welshmen
become conceited about their learning, the old and decidedly libellous lines will
have to be re-cast, and be read as follows:-

the purpose of enabling some of those who have determined
upon emigrating from Ireland, to take advantage of the vast
tracts of o country, which are lying untenanted and un-

urchased some 20,000 acres of prairie land, situated in Murray

Rather thought those Land-Leaguers down at Birmingham might

Mr. F-rst-r. Somewhere. But what did you mean, BR-GHT, by
that phrase about being “in favour of as much freedom as will give
security to freedom?”
Sir W., H-re-rt. Why, it's putting in a new way the old saying
about orthodoxy being my doxy. BR-GHT is to settle in his own
mind how much freedom will secure freedom, and that much he will
allow—in other words, just so much as he pleases.
Mr. Br-ght. I should have thought, H-RC-RT, that you had quite
enough to do to answer questions addressed to the Home Office, with-
out taking up those addressed to me.
Mr. Gl-dst-ne. Anyone seen H-RT-NGT-N ?
1–rd N-rthbr-k. Notto-day. . He’s a wiseman, and I wish I could
follow his example, and take things as easy.
Mr. F-rst-r. So do I. I wish he had gone to Ireland, and let me
look after India. Afghanistan may be bad, but it’s a flower-garden
compared with Westmeath. And then BIGGAR is not a plant that
would flourish in the East.
Lºrd S-lb-rne. It seems to me that H-RT-NGT-N goes on the lines
of that eminent. Statesman who didn't answer his letters, on the
principle, that if he left them alone long enough they would answer
emselves. H-RT-NGT-N always turns up half an hour late, in the
expectation that by that time business will have settled itself, and

will be shorter if we have the fewer in it. But it's no use talking,

reform of procedure. When I find an axe is worn out, I have it

UNDOUBTED OLD MASTER.
(By Himself.)
OSCAR INTERVIEWED.
New York. Jan. 1882.
DETERMINED to anticipate the rabble of penny-a-liners ready to
pounce upon any distinguished foreigner who approaches our shores,
and eager to assist a sensitive Poet in avoiding the impertinent
curiosity and ill-bred insolence of the Professional Reporter, I took
the fastest pilot-boat on the station, and boarded the splendid Cunard
steamer, The Boshnia, in the shucking of a pea-nut.
His AESTHETIC APPEARANCE.
He stood, with his large hand passed through his long hair, against
a high chimney-piece—which had been painted pea-green, with
panels of peacock-blue pottery let in at uneven intervals—one elbow
on the high ledge, the other hand on his hip. He was dressed in a
long, snuff-coloured, single-breasted coat, which reached to his heels,
and was relieved with a seal-skin collar and cuffs rather the worse
for wear. Frayed linen, and an orange silk handkerchief gave a
note to the i. artistic colouring of the ensemble, while one
small daisy drooped despondently in his button-hole . . . ... We may
state, that the sº as well as the seal-skin collar, is the
property of OsCAR, and will appear in his Lectures “on the Growth
of Artistic Taste in England.” But
HE SPEAKs FoR HIMSELF,
“Yes; I should have been astonished had I not been interviewed |
Indeed, i have not been well on board this Cunard Argosy. I have
wrestled with the glaukous-haired Poseidon, and feared his ravish-
ment., . Quite: I have been too ill, too utterly ill. . Exactly—
seasick in fact, if I must descend to so trivial an expression. I fear
the clean beauty of my strong limbs is somewhat waned. I am
scarcely, myself—my nerves are thrilling like throbbing violins,—
in exquisite pulsation.
“You are right. I believe, I was the first to devote my subtle
brain-chords to the worship of the Sunflower, and the apotheosis of
the delicate Tea-pot. I have ever been jasmine-cradled from my
youth. Eons ago, I might say centuries, in '78, when a student at
Oxford, I had trampled the vintage of my babyhood, and trod
the thorn-spread heights of Poesy, I had stood in the Arena and
torn the bays from the expiring athletes, my competitors.”
HIS GLORIOUS PAST.
“Precisely—I took the Newdigate. Oh! no doubt, every year
some man gets the Newdigate; but not every year does Newdigate
get an OsCAR. Since then-barely three years, but centuries to
such as I am—I have stood upon the steps of London Palaces—
in South Kensington—and preached AEsthetic Art. I have taught
the wan beauty to wear nameless robes, have guided her limp
limbs into sightless knots and curving festoons, while we san
of the sweet sad sin of Sw1NBURNE, or the lone delight of soft
communion with BURNE-Jon Es. Sw1NBURNE had made a name, and
BURNE-Jon Es had copied illuminations e'er the first silky down had
fringed my upper lip, but the Trinity of Inner Brotherhood was not
complete till I came forward, like the Asphodel from the wilds of
Arcady, to join in sweet antiphonal counterchanges with the Elder
Seers. We are a Beautiful Family—we are, we are, we are l’”
LECTURE PROSPECTs.
“Yes; I expect my Lecture will be a success. So does DoILAR
CARTE–I mean D'Oyly CARTE. Too-Toothless Senility may jeer,
and poor, positive Propriety may shake her rusty curls; but I am
here, in my creamy lustibood, to pipe of Passion's venturous Poesy,
and reap the scorching harvest of Self-Lovel I am not quite sure
what I mean. The true Poet never is. . In fact, true Poetry is
nothing if it is intelligible. She is only to be compared to SALMACTs,
who is not boy or girl, but yet is both.”
HIS NEOPHYTEs.
“Who are my neophytes ?, Well, I fancy the LoNSDALEs and the
IANGTRYs would have never been known if I hadn't placed them on
a pedestal of daffodils, and taught the world to worship.”
HIS KOSMIC SouL.
“Oh, yes! I speak most languages; in the sweet, honey-tinted
brogue my own land lends me. La bella Donna della mº Mºnte
exists, but she is not the Jersey Lily, though I have grovelled at her
feet; she is not the Juno Countess, though I have twisted my limbs
all over her sofas; she is not the Polish Actress, though I have sighed
and wept over all the boxes of the Court Theatre; she is not the
diaphanous SARAH, though I have crawled after her footsteps through
the heavy fields of scentless Asphodel; she is not the golden-haired
ELLEN, more fair than any woman VERONEsf, looked upon, though
I have left my Impressions on many and many a seat in the Lyceum
Temple, where she is the High Priestess; nor is she one of the little
Nameless Naiads I have met in Lotus-haunts, who, with longing eyes,
watch the sweet bubble of the frenzied grape. No, Sir, my real Love
is my own Kosmic Soul, enthroned in its flawless essence; and when
America can grasp the supreme whole I sing in too-too utterance
for vulgar lips, then soul and body will blend in mystic *: -
then, crowned with bellamours and wanton_flower-de-luce, I shali
be hailed Lord of a new Empery, and as I stain my lips in the
bleeding wounds of the Pomegranate, and wreathe .# o'ergrown
limbs with the burnished disk of the Sunflower, Apollo will turn
pale, and lashing the restive horses of the Sun, the tamer chariot of
a forgotten god will make way for the glorious zenith of the one
OSCAR WILDE.”
At this moment The Boshnia gave a sudden lurch, and the grand
young Poet fell prostrate on the rabbit-skins, worshipping Poseidon,
and calling feebly for the Steward. Seeing that he would be in-
capable of receiving any other interviewers, I quitted the cabin
drank the brandy-and-soda which the Steward was bringing, an
then returned to shore as quickly as possible. So here is the First

“ ONLY A MARINE | ?”
(A short Story told by the Corps and not to them.)
CHAPTER I.-He would be a soldier. So he went to Sandhurst and
was not very lucky, and he went to Woolwich and was rather un-
fortunate. With a plucking here, and a ploughing there, and
everywhere a mishap. But they got him a commission somehow at
last, and said he could do no harm—he was only a Marine! -
CHAPTEB II.-And he was very devoted to his profession. With
a term of service here, and a term of service there, and everywhere
a term. Now he was on land at Portsmouth, now he was at sea in
the Pacific Ocean. For years and years and years he knocked about
the world. But he did not get promotion—he was only a Marine !
CHAPTER III.-Then he thought he would go in for study. So he
put his name down for the Staff College. So he wore out his eyes in
ing, and wearied his brain in learning. With an extra subject
here, and a foreign lan e there, and everywhere a grind. Ånd
he worked, and worked, and worked until he passed. But passing
did him no fºr. was only a Marine !
CHAPTER IV. Then a war game. And he lead a forlorn hope here,
and took a fortress there, and everywhere showed heroism. And a
shower of rewards and honours fell upon everybody. But not upon
him—he was only a Marine ! - - -
CHAPTER W.—Then he grew grey-headed in the Service. His con:
temporaries were given good things here, and good things there, and
everywhere good things. One commanded a district in the north,
and another went to Head Quarters at Pall Mall, and a third was
quite snug in a nice little office in Ceylon. But he had to keep in
his barracks or to sail in his *...* was only a Marine !
CHAPTER WI. AND LAST –And so, he grew older and older. ...And
now he began to worry them at Whitehall. So he got an official
snubbing here, and an official snubbing there, and everywhere lots
of snubs. And he bowed down his silvered, old head, and broke his
heavy old heart, and laid down his tired old bones, and grieved, and
grieved, and grieved until he died. So they cut his epitaph upon his
tombstone and wrote—“Only a Marine !”

fairish sort of play; if all that Messrs. HARDY and CARs require at the hands of
Messrs. HARE, KENDAL, and PINERo be Fair Play, why here they have it. It is
unnecessarily spun out, and the Third Act is tedious. What is relied upon
as the great situation in Act II. is where the heroine throws herself at the feet
of her rejected lqver, and implores him not to shoot the young gentleman
whom he has found in her room at midnight, on the ground that he is her illegal
} met.
husband, “and,” she cries out, hysterically, “The father
of my child !” But this statement is a trifle premature,
as the child is yet unborn; and the situation is forced,
totally unnatural, and only dragged in as a coup de
théâtre to give Mrs. KENDAL an opportunity for a “flop”
—they all dearly love a flop nowadays—with which to
bring down the Curtain on a striking tableau, and to
elicit applause before two minutes have been allowed for
reflection. -
A great deal too much is made of the heroine's deli-
cate state of health. This subject was once gently
touched upon by Rob ERTson in Caste : it was risky even
then : here it is so dwelt upon as to offend some who
are not too squeamish about such matters. The fault
of this play, dramatically, is, that, from almost the very
first, the audience knows the means to the end: they L.
know that as sure as fate the invalid wife will die at
the right moment. Now, a Dramatist should always
allow his audience to discern what the end must be, but
should keep them in suspense as to the means whereby
that end is to be gradually attained. By the way, the
Young Soldier is invariably spoken of by everyone as
“Lieutenant,” as if he were in the Navy.
“HARE and KENDAL.” There’s a signature to a
letter! Like a couple of Dukes, or a Firm of Solicitors
without the “Messrs.” No necessity to describe them-
selves as “Messers,”—that’s pretty evident. But why
don’t “HARE and KENDAL,” instead of wasting their
precious time in writing theatrical letters to the news-
papers, occupy themselves in making their idiotic pic-
ture-gallery into a smoking-room, to avoid turning
the Cigarettists out into the street? But as * do
Fº to go in for Pictorial Art in that foyer, here,

SPINERO, the central figure, supported by Messrs. HARE
and KENDAL, “far from the madding crowd;” then
as Mr. CoMYNs CARR approaches with Mr. HARDY,
MonEYSPINERO, in the historical words of England's
naval hero, exclaims, “HARDY! HARDY! Kiss me,
HARDY!” And so they shake hands, and are friends
all round, and all share in the profits which their work
will bring to the virtuous and irreproachable, but
thoroughly business-like firm of “HARE and KENDAL.”

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE MEETING OF THE LANDLORDS.
How do the Landlords “come down on ” the Act 2
Here they come hurrying, there they come sºurrying,
Their minds about destiny dreadfully worrying;
With big “Resolutions” and #. against “Wrong,”
They hasten along, more sounding than strong.
Posing, and glosing,
Dread dangers disclosing, -
And hinting that Providence sure must be dozing.
Blaming, and shaming,
Declaiming, and flaming. - -
And large," Compensation” commandingly claiming.
bbing, and throbbing,
'Gainst Radical robbing,
Sighing and crying;
Rack-renting denying
With stinging jobation
Against confiscation,
And much botheration
About Valuation;
Spouting, and flouting, and doubting ;
Denouncing, and bouncing, and flouncing;
And fluttering, and muttering, and sputtering;
And swearing repairing the past is uptearing
Society's self from its basis and bearing ;
And flaring, and blaring, and simple souls scaring
%. wild elocution
About Revolution;
Proclaiming that Law is now putting a stopper
Qn Property's game in a manner improper:
That Civilisation is coming a ".
So the Landlords galore,
Like Cassandras, deplore,
And down on the Land Act like Cataracts pour,
O'er and o'er, o'er and o'er,
With a mighty uproar. -
While the World says, “We’ve heard all this Shindy
before ”

Mr. Korsts. In office hours! Scarcely professional, Miss FANNY–
scarcely professional:
Miss Fanny...Well, Sir, it's so lonely all by myself, and I am
sure music can hurt nobody.
Mr. Korsts. But the neighbours, Miss FANNY–the neighbours!
Miss Fanny... Oh, they don't object, Sir. You see, your idea has
been taken up by Mr. KNOCKABouT, the Auctioneer, up above, and
Mr. ELLIS DEE, the Banker, down below—and they neither of them
have any male clerks now. . We are all girls together. It’s great
fun en we Solicitors sing a Christy Minstrel song in unison as

Mr. Korsts. But the clients, Miss FANNY–the clients?
Miss Fanny. Oh, bother the clients, Sir Well, Sir, you may
stare. But you told us that was our chief duty, to bother the clients:
, Mr. Karsts (good-naturedly). Well, well—perhaps I did—perhapsi

Miss Fanny. Oh, she has behaved shamefully, Sir... You know
you put a man in possession at Mr. BROWN's. Well, Sir, Miss
AGNES persuaded the officer to take her to the Pantomime, and when
Mr. BRowN got the man once out of the house, he refused to let him
come in again!
Why, I shall be responsible for all

Miss Fanny. So I told her, Sir. But Miss AGNEs asked me to
mind my own business, and said I only did it because I was jealous
of her | Fancy being jealous of a Sheriff's Officer | So I ordered
her not to come back—and she hasn't. -
Mr. Korsts. Quite right. Her conduct called for instant dismissal.
And Miss MARY, the Chancery Clerk 2
Miss Fanny. iyon’t talk of her, Sir She had to examine the
marriage-settlement for Captain BUTTERFLY's betrothed, you know,
Sir. Well, Sir, she insisted upon seeing him to take his instructions.
Mr. Korsts. Well. That was certainly unprofessional, but the
Ca º will have to pay the expenses. And the settlement was all
right
Miss Fanny. She burned it, and eloped with the Captain'
Mr. Korsts. Good gracious! Why, I shall be ruined
Miss Fanny. Well, it’s your own fault. You oughtn't to engage
such hussies |
Mr. Korsts. And the others? I left Miss SUSAN to draw old Mr.

Miss Fanny. Yes. And she has drawn it. But then she has ren-
dered it invalid by going and marrying the testator | -
Mr. Korsts. Gracious ! What will his family say? And his
eldest son is our best client' And Miss ELLEN ?
Miss Fanny. Oh, she is the worst of the whole lot. You remember
Mr. SWEETMAN MILDMAYP -
Mr. Korsts. To be sure. We were proceeding against him on a bill
of exchange for £500.
Miss Fanny. Well, he used to pay marked attentions to me. He
used to send me bouquets and lots of things, Sir. Well, the deceit-
ful creature has actually taken him from me! She bribed him, Sir—
bribed him (Sobbin ..) I am sure he wouldn’t have given me up,
poor fellow ! if he hadn't been bribed |
Mr. Korsts. Bribed | What do you mean?
Miss Fanny. Why, the nasty, creature stopped all proceedings in
your name, and gave him. back the bill of exchange |
Mr. Korsts (exploding), Gracious goodness! (Angrily.) And you,
Miss FANNY, are responsible for all this You were head of the
office, and ought to have prevented the mischief I dismiss you on
the spot It will be no great loss, because I don't believe you have
done a single stroke of work since you have been in the office
There, now !

that female clerks could act as “intelligent brain-workers in the

THE PANTOMIMES AND ALHAMBRA.

Real Waterfall Scene, with its, Flower Ballet. GIRARDs good, but

Holiday Less'uns.
their style of entertainment has been done to death. Except in the
time of the PAYNEs, the “Garden” seldom did much in the way of
Pantomime. Odd as it may seem, }. can't expect to have a Panto-
mime without Pantomimists, he MARTINETTI troupe—young
CHARLEs LAURI and Mr. and Mrs. John D'AUBAN–are genuine
Pantomimists. So is
Mlle. GILLERT of the
Alhambra, who indeed
should be placed at the
head of the class. RAw-
DoN and FRED WoREs
were “once upon a time”
excellent; but the per-
formance of the WokEs
Family became mono-
tonous, and when imita-
tors discovered that to
kick a leg over a lady's
head without injuring a
hair of it, was not so
difficult as it had *E.
peared, but could be
performed equally well,
and even better, by a
dozen other Daddy Long-
legses — Mr. IRVING
might do it beautifully
in a dance with the two
Rose-girls—the novelty
was gone, and the
WoRESEs were danced
--- out. With all their
#"; º couldn't advance with the times. . When they return,
e Merry Family may take new steps to regain their popularity;
“Giving her a Leg up.”
Cabbing it Ministers at the Surrey.
and we shall perhaps find that “absence makes the legs grow longer,”
—and stronger. .
The Pantomimistreally holds a high rankindramatic Art, for as he
generally invents the character whose actions he is going to portray,
he, and not the Actor who simply illustrates his Author, can fairly
claim to have “greated a part.” The Entertainer, who changes his
yº coat and comes up from behind a table as Somebody Else,
if he has invented the character he represents, can justly claim to
have “created” that part: while the Actor, even though #. be Mr.
HENRY IRWING in his admirable delineation of Digby Grant, has no
more, “created” that part than he created Hamlet or The Flying
Ilutchman. The question is whether “creation” can be applied at
all except to making, something out of nothing as in the case of
raising a Nobody to the Peerage, and sºil. an Earl. We
leave this subject for the present.
The Surrey Pantomime.—Messrs. Conquest AND MERITT (who, of
course, are delighted at the success of their old friend and former col-
laborateur at the Adel-
phi) say in their adver-
tisements that “never
laughed so much be-
fore,” is the one ex-
pression of the delighted
audience who visit this
theatre. Dear us!
those audiences must
have had a dull life of
it up to now. Mr.
MACDERMoTT, the Con-
verted Jingo, is in good
form, and is the prin-
cipal attraction of the
Pantomime. But 0
Mr. ConquEST Mr.
CoNQUEST O' are you
conquered at last, and
henceforth are we only
to see your name as - - - -
Lessee and Manager, and never again in the Pantomime play-bill
either here or the Grécian? Can't you be a Tree, or a Rock, or a frog,
without taking those flying leaps for which you were so famous?
Come out as Something next year, and All shall be forgiven. ...
The Black Crook at the Alhambra is, we fancy, not so brilliant
as it used to be, and on the whole not so amusing. Messrs. PAULTON
and JARVIs are good contrasts. A chorus by Mr. FRED CLAY in the
Second Act is charming, and
Miss LizzIE Coote gives
Surrey Jesters.
Mr. Paulton and his long-lost Brother. “Fery Coote!”
“Nobody knows as I know” in a way which secures a double and
treble encore. M. Jacobi musically and dramatically is, we suppºse,
“the master of the situation,” but a little waking up all round is
required, and something more startling and brilliant expected by
the public.
London Firms.
Gippy AND TURNER. This Firm is peculiar. TURNER most º
would expect to be Gippy, but no one would expect GIDRY to be
TURNER. TURNER need not be GIDDY, unless he likes, and he will
probably be more careful in future. - -
SAvory AND MooRE. This is a ". Firm, although it deals
in physic. MooRE makes the black draughts, and his partner signs
them SAvory. It looks like Desdemona and Othello.
Sºon AND Opy. This is a mysterious Firm, Everyone knows
what Sºonis, but Opy they think is a new and untried Sauge.

RIGHT AND TITLE.
WHATEVER name Mr.
CoMYNs CARR has given
the dramatic adaptation
from Mr. HARDx's novel,
it is possible that the
original title, Far from
the Madding Crowd, will
be the one most appro-
priate. This version, owing
to the prior production of
Mr. PINERo's Squire, will
doubtless never see the
gaslight, and a life of
pºle seclusion is
fore it. A deal of non-
sense has been written on
this subject about a no-
velist's rights, but these
rights, as far as the Stage
is concerned, exist § In
the imagination. The law
gives the novelist no dra-
matic rights in his work,
but, on the contrary, takes
them away; and those who
aredissatisfied with the law
should try to get it altered.
The Jour de L'Ane.
THIS is £ºy called
the Jour de l'An, but as
the º: for a Com-
mercial Treaty were finally
broken off on this day, per-
haps the change of title
may not be deemed inap-
propriate. Protection, and
the love of Indirect or
Secret Taxation have pre-
yailed, and the forty mil-
lions of French population
are condemned to a long
and indefinite term of dear
clothing, for the special
benefit of a few hundreds
of French woollen manu-
facturers. The mistake
has probably been in over
negociation. One French-
man is equal to four Scotch
Jews in higgling over a
bargain.
EWERYDAY DANGERS.
(A Letter to the Editor.)
SIR,-There is not, of course, one law for the rich and another for
the poor, though occasionally its administration would lead the
attentive observer to ". so. But there is one way of managing
the traffic in the most fashionable quarter of the West and the most
commercial quarter in the East which is admirable, and quite
another way of mismanaging the traffic midway 'twixt Bast and
West, which is the very opposite of admirable. For instance, at the
top of fittie Queen Street, Holborn, which is the
“Dirtiest, muddiest,
Sloppiest, slippiest,
Sloshiest place in the world!”
the traffic converges from the four quarters, cabs, vans, carts, trucks,
and omnibuses uniting to make confusion worse confounded. :
Generally there is a Policeman on duty, doing nothing (which may
according to instructions) until aroused to a sense of what ought
to be his duty by some indignant foot-passenger who has vainly at-
tempted to cross the road, been nearly run over three times, had his
coat covered with mud, and been fiercely sworn at (of course) in con-
sequence. Sometimes there are two Policemen, but as they are either
exchanging civilities—they belong to the civil executive—or com-
paring nuts, they cannot be expected to afford any particular assist-
ance until a furniture van, two dray carts, a parcels delivery cart,
some coal carts, a few cabs and an omnibus or two get inextricably
mixed up, and then it occurs to the Force that it is time to say,
mildly, “Now then—move on l’”
The same thing at the bottºm of Changery Lane, Here any persºn
of suicidal tendencies, may “make a Juggernaut of hisself” with
very little chance of having the execution of his design interfered
Nº. by the Police—whose representative I have ſº noticed
on one side of the Lane, staring at º: in #. (perhaps he
was a poet), or chatting pleasantly with a damsel, who probably
"wanted to know” ; or, on the other side, engaged in conversation
with the grizzled warrior of affable manners, who, in a sort of uni-
form, stands as sentry on duty in front of the stationer's shop at
the corner, and whose general appearance would be decidedly im-
posing, but for a bad habit of putting his hands in his *...*
. slightly detracts from his dignity, but probably adds to his
COmfort.
Whatever the social attractions of the Fleet Streetend of Chancery
Lane may be for the Police, its dangers, arising from want of proper
regulation of traffic, are certainl Fº though not by one-fourth
equal to those at the Holborn end of Little Queen Street... .
Hoping, Sir, that Sir EDMUND HENDERson will see to this before
some serious accident happens,
I am, Mr. Punch, yours,
A Stop-AT-THE-CoANER-YoUNG-MAN.

“OLD MASTERs.”
“FLEMIsh BULL, AFTER PAUL Potter.”—(From the Collection of Mr. Punch.)
FUN FOR TOMMY'S HOLIDAYS.
The Humorous Ancestors.--This is a very simple but diverting
experiment. . A fine, old English country mansion being selected-
care being taken that the choice fall on one to which a rich and noted
gallery of historic and family portraits is attached—the manipulator,
taking advantage of a wet afternoon, and provided with a couple of
good-sized cans containing, respectively, thick white and vermilion
paint, commences his operations. Rapidly and grotesquely as pos-
sible he ". every figure in the ancestral collection, from the
Conquest downwards, with the broad facial characteristics of the
ordinary Pantomime Christmas Clown. When the above is neatly
carried out, as it should be, with WHART.on's Quick-Drying Inde-
structible, Permanent Enamel Paint, and on the occasion of some
large and festive county gathering, the surprise and, merriment
created by this pleasing jeu d'esprit seldom fail to lend an unex-
pected Éclat to the whole entertainment, the head of the family being
at last ºf. to confess, in answer to much good-tempered banter,
that he is descended from unmistakably humorous Ancestors.
The Hesitating Bridal Party.—Nothing is required for this
:leasing and elegant little experiment but about two gallons of cod-
ver oil—the coarsest kind will do—and about half a bushel of the
popular medicine known as ENo's Fruit Salt. Half-a-dozen cham-
pagne-bottles being previously filled with these materials carefully
†† and neatly corked and wired in the usual fashion, are
handed to the butler at the last moment, with particular instructions
that they contain “a choice and special brand of wine,” that is to be
reserved solely for the drinking of the health of the happy pair. On
the toast being given with." three times three,” and the glasses
duly charged with the compound, which in colour and effervescence
º resembles a rich fruity and creaming wine of a ". charac-
ter, the guests, much to the astonishment of the host, whose glass
has been secretly filled with real champagne at thirty ..
a dozen, appear to accord it the usual honours somewhat half-
heartedly; and when the next toast is proposed, and there is a fresh
to “ charge glasses,” the whole bridal party unanimously assume
an air of amusing hesitation.
The Insupportable Professor.—Being assured that at a musical “at
home” the chief feature of the evening will be the performance of a
celebrated German Professor on the drawing-room grand, which is to
be specially reserved for him, place carefully under each of the
patent dampers one of BLAKER's Self-exploding Detonating Blasting
Caps, and arrange a five-hundred-cell Gramme battery in connection
with the key-board and music-stool. Your piano is now ready. On
the Professor taking his seat at the instrument, his first flourish on
the keys not only causes a series of deafening explosions, but, his
contact completing the electric circuit, forces him to utter a sharp
ell of surprise on, experiencing the violent shock. As every time
e touches a note, this entertaining experience is repeated with in-
creasing intensity, the Professor, by universal consent, soon be-
comes insupportable.
The Revolving Grandpapa.-This amusing surprise is again prac-
tised with happiest effect in a comfortable, well-ordered country house.
It having been ascertained that “ ...}. has been put § in
the best guest's bed-room, containing a handsome old-fashioned four
post bedstead, a hole is bored through the ceiling, and from the
chamber above, four stout ship's ropes are passed through the aperture
and securely fixed respectively to the top of the four pillars of the
bedstead beneath. This once effected, the whole afternoon should be
. in twisting them tighter and tighter into a firm coil, which
should be eventually made fast to a moveable, but massive beam.
The hour for retiring to rest arriving, the fact that the venerable
occupant of the bed put out his candle and comfortably settled
himself for the night, should be carefully ascertained. The operator
being assured of this, now suddenly raises the beam on to two chairs
in the chamber above; when the bed, being also raised, is released
from its hold on the floor, and begins to spin round and round
violently on its axis. In a very few seconds the whole household,
summoned by his shouting, will rush, to the room, and to their
infinite merriment find Grandpapa rapidly revolving.
*...* To “MasTER ToMMY,” who has written to us, enclosing stamps, and
asked us whether the little volume to which we incidentally referred, A
Hundred Ways of making Uncle Jump, will be equally available for
“Aunty,” we reply, “Certainly—nothing could be better. it.” N.B.-
We also recommend to “MastER ToMMy's" notice Hysteries Made Easy,
an excellent little work, that, in dealing with his elderly female relatives,
“MasTER ToMMY " will find quite invaluable.

REGINA versus Coney and Others.-This was a case as to whether
spectators at a Prize-Fight had been lawfully convicted for “abet-
ting the pugilists,” or for committing an “assault.” There bein
no work of any sort to do in the other Courts, eleven Judges attende
to decide the important question, “What constitutes an assault P*—
this being a moot point in English law up to the present time.
Mr. Pea Greene (who appeared for the Prisoners) argued that
the offence of which the prisoners were guilty, was certainly not an
assault, and could not be a battery.--
Mr. Justice Stiffun., A very able (though slightly indigestible)
“Digest of the Criminal Law,” lays down that there are fifty-five
different kinds of assault. Now— -
The Chief Justice. Oh, when you come to definitions, that always
reminds me of what a great English writer has said, -“Show me a

Mr. Pea Greene. Pretty even, my Luds, I believe.
Mr. Justice Floorkins. If your clients were just looking on for a
few moments, how came it that they stayed half an hour, in fact,
until the ring broke up on the arrival of the Police?
Mr. Pea Greene. Oh, ah, well, my Lud, let me refer your
Ludship to the case of Rex versus SMITH, and Regina versus BRown,
where I’m sure your Ludship's difficulty is fully answered.
Mr. Baron Muddlestone. e question is, what sort of presence is
necessary to constitute aiding and abetting? Is it bodily presence?
All the Justices. Oh, it can't possibly be bodily presence,
Mr. Baron Muddlestone. Of course not. Presence in law means
absence in body. Then comes the point, were the prisoners encou-
raging the prize-fighters, H., .
Mr. Justice Stiffun. Take this case. Suppose A. says to B., “if
C. assaults me, knock him down!”. Then D., E., and F., who have
been getting blackberries on land belonging to G., happen to pass,
and seeing H. engaged in marking out a ring, they go up to a

Mr. Baron Muddlestone. Are two persons practising fencing

Mr. Baron Muddlestone. So was I. But single-stick was my
forte. Nobody could touch methere.
The Lord Chief Justice. Well, well, SHARspeARE in a very fine

SPORT-FROM THE PIGEON'S POINT OF VIEW.
THE SHIP OF THE FUTURE.
Sir WILLIAM ARMsTRong, speaking, on Nautical Defence, advocated
light swift ships, only partially armoured, with very heavy guns, which he
considered to be far superior to ironclads.]
It was a gallant Captain, and he sailed upon the sea.
Quoth he, “The lumb'ring ironclads can ne'er get hold of me;
I steam much faster than them all; so, in the times of war,
I’ll simply pour a broadside in and then fly off afar.
“I carry heavy metal, too, the newest of new guns,
The playthings that are rated at a simple hundred tons; , .
They’ll go º every armour-plate like paper, such their pow'r,
*. having fired, I’ll steam away at sixteen knots an hour."
“And should the enemy hit me, it’s easy to divine, ..
With engines and with boilers placed below my water-line,
They’ll hardly touch a vital part, constructed as I am,
While I am free to charge at them and use my deadly ram.
“I’m light, and I’m unarmour'd save just where my guns are
laced :
For, lić. a lad , I am well protected at the waist;
Before me shall each ironclad in fight give up the ghost.
And “England's Wooden Walls’ again shall be the standing toast !”
SOMETHING LIKE A CIRCULAR.
(Picked up close to Capel Court.)
MR._JEREMIAH DIDDLER, Sworn Speculator to all the principal
Stock Exchanges of Europe, America, and elsewhere, begs to inform
his friends and supporters that he has several most promising in-
vestments in his eye, that he can confidently recommend to their
serious attention. "First and foremost he would suggest that
THE HERNE BAY GOLD AND SILVER MINING COMPANY
is an undertaking that must (sooner or later) pay cent. per cent. At
present, the site of the mining º: (on the sands immediately
facing, and three miles distant from the clock tower) is admirably
adapted for another purpose. Until the necessary machinery can be
erected, the Directors propose using the water above the sands for
bathing. As many excursionists visit Herne Bay annually during
the summer months, this scheme alone should yield a very consider-
able dividend...Turning from Home to Foreign Affairs, Mr. J. D.
ºiced with satisfaction the proposal to promote a fund to be
Galle
THE SULTAN's SACRED-WoRD-of-Honour DEBENTURE BONDs,
which must, of its innate nature, be a most valuable investment. It
H has been suggested that His Majesty, with the assistance of the
Galata Bankers, should raise a hundred thousand pounds, with a
nominal value of five millions on the ample seeurity º His Majes
's
solemn word of honour, that he will pay the debt in full at six weeks'
date. His Majesty has most graciously consented to this arrange-
ment. Besides these extremely promisins investments, Mr. J.
DIDDLER can confidently recommen
THE SUN AND Moon Junctron RAILway CoMPANY.,
which is still in nubibus, but on the eve of being started. There is
no doubt that ačrial .# is in its infancy. Balloons and flying
apparatuses have proved, without the possibility of a doubt, that the
atmosphere is perfectly capable of being navigated. The projected
Railway will traverse a line of country that hitherto has H. left
uite unworked. There is no doubt that if well supported, the
mpany should pay its original Shareholders a large profit on their
certificates. Again, Mr. J. DIDDLER would strongly recommend to
the speculative and benevolent,
THE LITTLE CHILDREN's BANK,
which it is expected will prove a triumphant success. The Bank
will not only “turn over” the pocket-money of its tiny clients, but
also *::::::: mortgages, sell reversions, and transact every branch
of the discount business. , Money will be promptly advanced on
infants' notes of hand, with the purely collateral security of a post
obit or a bill of sale. It is º: that the earnings of the Little
Children's Bank will never less than three thousand per cent.
.* to other ventures of a favourable character, Mr. J. DIDDLER
selects
THE DWELLERS IN PRISONS AND INMATES OF UNIONS
Co-operaTIVE STORES
as an Association of extraordinary merit. The idea of this Society
is to furnish every Convict and Pauper with the necessaries and
luxuries of life at a rate a little over cost price. It is confidently
expeeted that these two classes of the community will eagerly avail
themselves of the benefits thus generously offered them. To turn to
another branch of enterprises, Mr. DIDDLER suggests that
THE LOST AT SEA INSURANCE COMPANY
should prove a perfectly safe investment to the most cautious. The
rule upon § policies are granted (that the individual whose life
is insured against loss at sea should a P. in person for the payment
of the money) is financially sound and closed to the slightest objec-
tion. ... The Company has already established agencies at Hanwell
and $ºy Hatch, where insurers are daily enrolled in very large
numbers.
In conclusion, Mr. JEREMIAH DIDDLER once more assures, his
friends and the Public generally that he is prepared to undertake
any investment transaction at the shortest notice. That there ma
be no doubt as to his identity (for Mr. QIDDIER has many imitators
he has adopted a “motto trade mark” which exactly explains his
mode of doing business—“Heads, my winnings— , your losses.
No money returned.”

D Aunt (grimly). “Of course ! Most of THE PROPERTY Is LEFT To HIM, MY

ON THE MUNICIPAL REFORM BILL,
(To Mr. Punch.)
SIR,-In the course of your long and prosperous career you have had
many a hearty laugh at the old Corporation of the City of London, but the
laugh, though hearty, has always been good-natured, and directed less against
what was done by that venerable Body than at the strange, old-fashioned way
in which they did it, at the somewhat antiquated customs by which they
were surrounded, and the apparently unnecessary tenacity #. which they
clung to them. Íſany of their deeds, Sir, I assure you, have been of a highly
useful and even generous character, and these, coupled with the fact of the
Corporation's continuous existence through at least, seven centuries, doubtless
contribute largely to that sort of kindly feeling with which they are regarded
by the citizens of London.
You will therefore learn, Sir, with much regret that it is, in contemplation
by Her Majesty's Government to utterly and entirely abolish this time-honoured
Institution, and to substitute for it a brand-new Municipality of such gigantic
proportions as to be sufficient to provide for all the jº of a population
of four millions of people.
You, Sir, above all people,9ught to be deeply interested in its preservation,
for you would be most un g to lose an Institution that has afforded you
and your multitudinous readers so much harmless amusement.
Let us, then, first consider, what the old Institution is that it is proposed
to abolish, before examining what is to be put in its place.
The Corporation is, the Local Authority for the City of London, which is
F. the richest, the healthiest, the freest, the smallest, and, at night, the
east populous metropolitan city in the whole world;
It is a good §§. of Local Government. Its constitution is thoroughly
democratic. Every Ratepayer is a Voter, and the Election is annual.
Every street, lane, court, and alley is effectually sewered, and "cleansed
every. day, and washed every night, and some £50,000 are spent yearly in
widening and improving them. Its Police are the best in the three kingdoms—
I do not include the Irish Constabulary, armed for special service—and have
great, responsibilities cast, upon them by reason of the enormous amount of
wealth left nightly to their sole protection; and last, but not least, the
death-rate:is lower than in any other part of the
Metropolis.
Whether all this is sufficient to

other absurdities that seem to cling to most ". old
Institutions, and Lord Mayor's Show, and the ol gilt

the participants—in fact, all that may be summed up in
Gog-and-Magogism—must be fairly considered. If not,
the question, may yet arise, whether, it is nºt possible to
abolish all the unnecessary absurdities of this old Insti-
tution, and yet retain its usefulness." -
If you º allow me,’t Sir, I will return to the subject
next week, and am Yours Truly,
AN. UNCOMMON CouncILMAN.
* We admit the force of this argument. But doesn't the
new scheme suggest the creation of a “Deputy Lord Mayºr,
and what are termed in theatrical parlance doublures, ºr “under-
studies,” for all the other parts? This looks more like adding
to the comic material than diminishing it. Yet, on the other
hand, a double harlequinade, with two clowns and two panta-
loons, is a tedious affair, and something of a muddle--Mr. P.

To make it go farther despaired of contriving,

Q. And what was Magna Charta ?
4. The great instrument by which the #. insubordination
of the Barons was checked, the germ of a dangerous representative
system stamped out, and the hereditary 'A'. of the British
onarchy secured.
Q. Was any further attempt made in a subsequent age to subvert
Magna Charta ?
... Yes. OLIVER CROMWELL endeavoured later to set it at defiance,
but he was severely punished by CHARLEs THE FIRST, who, by a
judiciºus exercise of his prerogative, cut off the troublesome Puri-
tan's head, and in so doing saved the country for ever from the
*...*.*. peril of voting its own supplies.
Q. Does British * urnish us with any further example of
firmness tempered by infallibility being advantageously displayed
by he Crown?
. Yes... GEORGE THE THIRD, by his clear judgment, infinite tact,
and constitutional determination, freed the country entirely from
the yoke of its American Colonies, reduced the National †: to
vanishing point, and left Parliament, at the close of his reign, in a
condition of Hº: purity.
Q. And is it possible to-day to revive and give practical effect to
these glorious traditions of the past?

ment with interest and gratitude.

AN AUSTIN-TATIOUS DRAMA.
Ev1DENTLY roused to indignation by the failure of The Laureate's
Queen *% the feeble flight of The Falcon, and the Terry-cotta
success of The Cup which cheered the gushers, and inebriated the
AEsthetes, the other ALFRED, surnamed the Less, known to the
poetically-inclined public as ¥r. Airmed AUSTIN, whose composi-
tions must be reckoned as among our Standard works, has published
a five-act Tragedy--(Hooray for the old legitimate five-act form
—which, to judge from his modest and unassuming Preface (we
worth reading), he wrote with a very practical view to its being
performed at one of our London Theatres; but as it has not yet been
produced, we are led to suppose that the Managers, blind to their
own interests, have declined it with thanks, and have in turn left
the MS. with their respective *::::::::::::: to be called for by the
Author himself. Rejected by the Managers, Mr. AUSTIN publishes
his play, and says, in effect, to the Public,+“Look here! this
ought to be acted you know ! You haven't got any Dramas on the
stage like this nowadays l’’ and, we admit, we haven't.
Its title published, as a book is Savonarola, but from internal
evidence we fancy that, for any Melodramatic Theatre, it would
have been brought out as
SAWONAROLA;
OR,
THE MAID ! The Monk | | THE MARTYR l l l AND THE
MISCREANT | | | |
finishing with a sensation scene at the Stake, unequalled since the
final tableau in Joan of Arc, at the Queen's.
And to show what a thoroughly practical dramatist Mr. ALFRED
AUSTIN is, it is only necessary to mention for example, that the
Scenes in the first Act are consecutive “sets,” each requiring the
entire stage, the stage-direction in each case being "the scene
shifts.” Managers are shifty people, but they’d be put to a pretty
shift to carry out Mr. AUSTIN’s arrangement.
The Dramatis Persona consist of from about seventy to a hundred
speaking parts, besides several distinct crowds, a large body of
oristers, and some most important Supers. Any Theatre with a
moderate º of about two hundred experienced Actors, in-
cluding fifty Principals, could produce Mr. AUSTIN's Savonarola
at a comparatively imail cost. - -
Now, as Mr. AUSTIN prides himself (vide inimitable Preface) on
having written this little play “to be acted,” and not merely as a closet
drama, for what theatre could he have intended it? Evidently
either the Criterion, the Royalty, or the Folly—and we have no
doubt Mr. Toole spent many anxious hours over Mr. AUSTIN's MS.
before rejecting the part of Savonarola merely because a few more
extras and Supers would have to be added to his already enormous
company. At the Gaiety, of course, it would have been a big draw,
but from information received, we imagine Mr. Hollings HEAD's
letter on returning the MS. was couched somewhat in these terms:—
DEAR SIR,-Thanks. Capital piece for ToolE, Criterion, or Prince
of Wales's. Could have done it here with TERRY, FARREN, and
WAUGHAN, only we don't go beyond Burlesques in Three Acts,
regular begin-at-eight-and-put-me-to-bed-at-eleven-thirty enter-
tainment. Doing first-rate business. TERRY might travel with
Savonarola, he goes into the country when our French **
ours, - --
P.S.–Might have done it at the Op. Com., but Mother-in-Law
is a “go.” THoRNE wants a piece, Try Vaudeville; or might
shove it on at the Gaiety for a matinée just to see how it goes, eh?
As to the length of these five Acts, the book consists of three
hundred and six pages of average type. When any Manager does
roduce it, what a real treat is in store for him and the Public |
# Mr. ALFRED AustLN takes our advice, he would, accept Mr.
Hollings.HEAD's offer, and “try it at a Gaiety matinée, just to see
how it goes.”
MRs. RAMSBOTHAM on hearing that a certain well-known AFsthetic
Poet had gone to New York, observed, “Ah, how everyone will
stare at him ſhe'll be the Šinecure of all eyes!”

“CRI " AND LAUGH.
THE revival of The Great Divorce Case ought to prove as great a
success for the Criterion as it did when first produced. It is im-
mensely funny, it goes with roars of laughter, and Mr. WYNDHAM's
Company act this sort of piece better than even the Palais Royal
Here's the Dog, after “Where's the Cat?”
Actors—at least, for our audiences, who want the essence of fun
iven them in the shortest possible time. . The dialogue in the First
ctis smart, and to the point; though in the other two Acts the action
is so rapid, and the bustle so continuous, that there is scarcely time
for *::::: or listening. - ---
Mr. MALTBY, as Grandison, the made-up old, beau, with a failing
memory and an invincible propensity to sleep directly he sits down
is as good a bit of acting, of course of an exaggerated and farcica
character, as can be seen in town. -
Mr. KNIGHT's Pilkie is a capital contrast to the boisterous
Geoffrey Gordon of Mr. WYNDHAM. If Mr. KNIGHT could only
ive up sliding over the carpet, instead of walking, and throwing,
jºintly, melodramatic emphasis into the part, it would be
aultless.
The great thing in this class of piece is “go; ” and, Mr. WYND-
HAM certainly does keep it going, and keep them, all going, and
the theatre going too, till, on reflection—but you can't reflect, except
when it’s all over—it occurs to us that the keep-going may be a bit
overdone, and the same result might be obtained at a less sacrifice,
“Who shall decide when Doctors disagree ?”
which must ultimately tell on the physical condition of the Actor, and
leads the audience to demand increased exertions in every new piece
at this theatre. There is the danger. The excitement must be
kept up : reaction is fatal. Be this as it may—and the case is as we
have put it, we are certain—those who, in these realistic days, want
to enjoy a real laugh at real rollicking fun—in fact, who simply
want to be amused after a day's work, can't do better than see The
Great Divorce Case at the Criterion.
MRs. RAM is deeply concerned about the condition of Birmingham,
which she understands is represented by BLIGHT and CHILBLAIN.
“MOWING ORGANISMS.”
[DR. FRANKLAND reports that the Thames water sent out during
December by the West Middlesex and Southwark Companies, was much
polluted with organic matter. The Grand Junction Company's water
contained moving organisms.]
OH, it’s sad to read what FRANKLAND of the London water writes,
And too awful are the visions that our fancy sees at nights;
Though it may be bright and sparkling like a sunbeam sent through
prisms,
Those are colours of putrescence and of “moving organisms l’”
If the Companies so treat us, ’tis becoming very clear,
We shall have to give up water and drink nought but wine or beer;
For consider how in families what angry rows and schisms,
Will arise from that Grand Junction with its “moving organisms.”
All the Companies o'ercharge us, and, in quite a playful way,
They send bills just after Christmas which are due at Lady Day:*
And . care not for our protests and our angry criticisms,
While they poison us with sewage and with “moving organisms' "
“"Apurrow uły 58wp,” PINDAR said in song in ancient days,
And no doubt the Grecian water well deserved the poet's praise;
But in these times we can only mourn the ghastly cataclysms
That are likely to befall us from these “moving organisms l’”
* The Grand Junction Company sent out bills early in January, saying that
the amount is due to the Company for the supply of water to Lady Day, 1882:
that is to say, nearly three months before the said supply is completed. This
is certainly a moving organism'
“UPROUSE YE, THEN, MY MERRY, MERRY MEN "
AFEw Gentlemen not altogether unknown in literary and dramatic
dress-circles met together about ten days ago, in camera obscurá, to
discuss the possibility of establishing classes corresponding to the
Etudes Dramatiques at the Paris Conservatoire. There is much that
is good in the idea as an idea, but we are afraid it is impracticable.
Painters have their Academy, Musicians have theirs, and are to have
a College, like Surgeons; but Authors and Actors must§. on as they
Carl. t the Actors have a school by all means, as they say they
want it, and they must be taken as knowing best their own educa-
tional deficiencies, but as to Authors, let all set themselves to procure
an amendment of the Copyright Law, and let the Dramatists agitate
for a Dramatic Authors' Society lº established as it is in France,
and they will no longer be the slaves of foot-lamps, compelled to
serve ABANAZAR the Manager, or ALADDIN the mushroom Proprietor,
but be independent spirits and busy bees, gathering money all the
day from every little shining treasury whose yield used formerly
§§ to benefit the Manager. To that band of Brothers we say
Uprouse ye, then, my merry, merry men, and bestir yourselves !
“Who will be free,” &c. But strike—and quickly.
From a German Party.
“THE May Laws,” which should always have been known as
“The Mayn't Laws,” will probably be rescinded, and the War-to-
the-Knife-and-FALCK between . Conscience and Kulturkampf in
Germany be decided in favour of the former.
THE Daily News had a paragraph headed “A Miracle Play in
Worcestershire.” Londoners need not go so far for a Miracle Play,
a sample of which, written by that Unconscious Celebrationalist,
Mr. MoREYSPINERO, may be seen every night till further notice at the
St. James's...The only thing about the Miracle Play at the St. James's
connected with Worcestershire is its “source,” which Mr. MoMEY-
SPINERo refuses to acknowledge.
HAPPY THOUGHT.
No more colour-blind people as Engine-drivers who can't distin-
§. red from green, and who invariably make white into black

THE TWO MEMNONS-JOINTLY NOTING.
THE NEW DEPARTURE IN BURLESQUE.
SIR,-The new piece called The Cynic—which no doubt you have already criticised—
seems to me to be an entirely new burlesque of GoFTHE's masterpiece. Why should not
the two HERMANNs–Messrs. WFZIN and MERIVALE—develope this idea?
IHamlet, put into sixteen-shilling trousers, the registere P. and the age of stucco,
would probably be even a greater success in this new vein of adaptation. The title might
be Poppinborough, The Wicked Uncle. The Queen-Mother would be the Duchess of Poppin-
BQRough, of Poppinborough House, Piccadilly, and Ballspond Hall, Poppinborough, Herts.
The King *iº. the Duke of Poppin Borough, the brother of the murdered Duke; and,
to make the resemblance to the original, play more close, he should have seized the Duke-
dom, and ousted the young Lord from his title, at the same time that he murdered his
brother (the young Lord's #. and married the Duchess, the young Lord's mother. . .
.The ºº:: could be retained, and made much more effective, than it is in the original
piece, by a very simple process. In imitation of those Palais-Royal farces, in which
the Actors come amongst the Audience, and, carry on the action simultaneously, both
before and behind the curtain, a large stage-box could be reserved every evening for
the ducal party, in, which the Duke and
Duchess could show the agonies of remorse,
while witnessing the Gorgonzola drama on
the stage.
The part of the Gravedigger would require
very little alteration, except to harmonise
the dialogue with the chickaleary tone of
the period. A Spade dance might be in-
troduced, if necessary. The other charac-
ters might easily be measured for modern
clothes, and the Cemetery Scene would be
a decided novelty.
In the present disgraceful state of the
Copyright Laws, this valuable idea once
rinted and published is anybody's }.
ut those who use it will at least have the
decency to acknowledge the source, and
send a donation to some charity—say the
Asylum for Idiots. Yours,
TWO TO ONE.
(A Villanelle.)
Love, you are Utter, I'm Too-too,
Yet we are one in some things. Say,
Am I not therefore dear to you?
You love the green that shades to blue;
I like the blue that’s somewhat grey—
Love, you are Utter, I’m Too-too!
You to the sunflower are true;
I love the lily, loved of May—
Am I not therefore dear to you?
And I can place myself askew,
And you are plastic-ally splay—

BUMBLEDOM-ON-SEA.
BUMBLEDOM has long 5. the earth,
and the waters under the earth, and pre-
paratory to making a combined attack upon
the sky, it is now trying to govern the sea.
The Town Council of Dover, for reasons best
known to themselves, are jealous of the one

interested in these impious schemes. The

Council of Brighton, not to be behind their
more Eastern brethren, have also resolved

“Kursaal” on the Brighton beach.
THE CLöTURE.-Object to it because it’s
French P So is Premier. But if we want
good forcible colloquial English why not call
it “The Shut-up”? The SPEAKER would
be the “Shutter-up.” And the new
arrangement, if adopted, would be known

WHAT did he die of, say, oh say,
Garcinoma or Enteritis?
Did he come to the fatal day,

Here they name his medical man;
Was he of drugs a neat concocter?
Did he do all a doctor can,
And if he did, why blame the doctor?
Was the patient a sober soul,
Never imbibing rum or brandy;
Or did his eyes with ardour roll,
Seeing the Bourbon whiskey handy?
Did the doctor remark, with pain,
That he would reach his final haven
If he should touch Old Rye again;
For if he did—let that be graven.

tive Committee of the newly-established School of Dramatic Art, the
proceedings, in consequence of the natural surprise of nearly everyone
ºf the Members at finding himself on the Committee at all, were of an
unusually interesting character, and there was a large attendance.
After Miss LETHERE, the Lady Matron of the School, had given in
her. Report, in which she made avery strong and reasonable protest
against the advisability, even in the interests of Art, of continuing
the usual property banquet, which has hitherto been served to the

Rwould be appointed to subject the diet to the test of prolonged per-

ceedings were about to terminate, when several Members, among whom
[were Lord WHARNCLIFFE, Lord Lytton, Lord Rowton, the Hon. A.
|Yoakº, and Mr. C. C. BETHUNE sprang suddenly to their feet, and,
|amidst some altercation, endeavoured to catch the Chairman's eye.
On order being restored, Mr. C. C. BETHUNE, who had persistently
laimed a hearing, said that “he felt he could put into a very few
ºrds, all his honourable colleagues wished to express.”. They had,
with him, one common question to ask the public, and that question
was, “ what on eartha. doing here?” (Cheers.) For his own
rt, he could only reply, “For the life of me, I can't tell you!”
#º People, owing to a%. crisis, had heard of Lord
wion—(“Yes,” from d º-º: who in the world
has ever heard of “Mr. C. C. BETHUNE”? (Loud and prolonged

Mr. H. GARDNER rose. He said he considered Mr. CoMyNs CARR
and Mr. E. M. UNDERDown a couple of amateurs.
Mr. CoMyNs QARR.—“You’re another l’’ (Roars of laughter.)
Mr. ALFRED THoMPson protested against wasting the time of the
Meeting infrivolity. They had met for business. He had brought
with him a new design of his own for the academical dress of the
Principal. He had, he admitted, used flesh-colour largely; but,
slashed with BookER's green at the shoulder, violet satin drawers,
and the usual College cap in Genoese plush, he considered the cos-
tume commanding and º: (“Bear.”)
Mr. A. W. DuBourg asked, diffidently, whether it wouldn't be cold.
The Hon. L. WINGFIELD,-‘‘Perhaps the honourable Gentlemanis
himself afraid of another frost.” (Loud laughter.)
Sir Courts-LINDsay rose. He said he thought the best way would
be, after the evident feeling manifested in some quarters, to take the
|
sense of the Committee, if possible, by a Motion. He wished it to
have a still wider and more cosmopolitan character. He proposed
that in addition to the present list of names there be added those of
the Duke of Norfolk, Messrs. CRossE AND BLACKWELL, Mr. ENo,
Mr. ALFRED G. WANCE, the Editor of Bradshaw's Railway Guide,
H.R.H. the Duke of CAMBRIDGE, and the surviving Executors of the

other worthy Members were supposed to know about the Stage? He
proposed that his name, together with those of Mr. EDMUND Rout-
LEDGE, Mr. FREDERICK LockeR, Mr. E. PigoTT, and Mr. Scott
GATTY be struck off in a lump. (Roars of laughter, in which the
Motion was carried unanimously without a division.) --
On the confusion again subsiding, and Mr. HAMILTON Afdf,
expressing somewhat warmly his surprise that he had, not been

THE CHANNEL TUNNEL.
Vive la France / and not now, as of old, Pive la guerre /
Although Neptune may greet us with cynical smile,
We shall suffer no more from that sad mal de mer, - -
When we’ve linked by a railway fair France with this isle.
And though WolsFIEY express some undignified fears,
We shall fearlessly tunnel the Channel, and find,
When the work is achieved by our smart engineers,.
That the labour's been done for the good of mankind.
Then let's hope that the Tunnel may prosper, in vain
Let the croakers talk on, there's a prize to be won;
With the strong hand of science we tunnel the main,
Though the years will roll on ere the great work is done.
But we look to the future with confident glance,
And one day, when two nations 'neath ocean shallfare,
Will not Europe in envy exclaim “Vive la France.”
And applauding our energy, “Pive l’Angleterre.'”

HALF-‘‘ ours º' WITH | THE DUTCHMAN ?”
AND “THE CYNIC.”
Of the audience that crowded the Haymarket last Thursday
night, it may be safely affirmed that the majority came specially to
see Mrs. LANGTRY as Blanche Haye, and not merely to witness the
revival of Ours. The part was well, chosen for this well-known
lady's professional début, after her trial trip as Miss Hardcastle;
A good actress can make something of it, an indifferent one cannot
hurt it. A clever actress can ſº by the strongest situation of
the piece to her own individual advantage, but the effect ºf this
situation does not depend on her; and on this occasion judicious
stage-nursing saw the débutante safely through the only ordeal-
namely, at the end of the Second Act—which can make any serious
demand on an actress's histrionic capabilities.
Had the novice been Miss SMITH or Miss Jones, equally unknown
to London, her performance would have been dismissed by the
journalistic critics in, a few words which would, probably, have
informed the Public that Miss SMITH or Jones had still a very great
deal to learn, and might have gone on to express some surprise that
a Management, º: to pride itself on rivalling The Français in ||
ss ot-1
the completene ts ensemble, might, with the resources at its com-
mand, have selected a more experienced repressntative of even such
a comparatively unimportant character as that of Blanche Haye. .
Beyond saying this, the subject, as a * of Dramatic Art,is
not worth another line, or another thought. The curiosity of “The
Town” has been aroused, and the Haymarket Management
reap the benefit of an astute speculation. -
As to the piece º , a secondary consideration), Mr.
ARTHUR Cecil made the sort of comfortable Russian Prince who
would be easily captured in the first Crimean skirmish by anybody
capable of running a trifle faster than a tortoise; Mr. PINERo was a
melodramatically villanous Sir Alexander Shendryn; Mr. CoNWAY

“gallant” something); Mr. BANCRQET an amusing, Hugh, Chalcot,
with excellent imitations of the late Mr. Buckston E(scarcely appre-
ciated by the º: generation), and his Pantaloon business with
the jam-pot and leg-of-mutton in the Third Act, was evidently the
result of a thoroughly conscientious and exhaustive study of the
Oldest Masters in this line; Mr. SMEDLEY was an officer-like Captain
Samprey : and Mr. C. BRookEIELD a soldier-like Sergeant Jones.
But this last actor is a thorough Artist.
Miss LE THIERE was an admirable Lady Shendryn, that is if
Lady. Shendryn was ever intended by the Author to be anything like
Miss LE THIERE.; Mrs. Novice was a passable Blanche Haye; and
inimitable Mrs. BANCROFT was as good as ever as Mary Netley, whose
fun, spurt, and “go,” have always saved the limping Third Act,
and with it the piece, of which only the Second Act is worth any-
thing at all; and the working up of that to its climax of the depar-
ture of the troops with the band playing the National Anthem, is a
masterpiece of stage-craft.

A genuine success. Good chorus—better band, and very excellent

in the Spring, and should the success of the twin enterprises in store
for all good Wagnerites equal that obtained by Monday's perform-
ance, the Composer's lot’s indeed a happy one-happy one.
As Vanderdecken, Mr. Ludwig is as picturesque and accursèd-
looking as any Sentº-even a Head-centre-could desire, and as good
a singer as any Public could wish for. Miss WALLERIA’s Senta is
almost without flaw; she is the Senta of attraction, and we should
say that a better exponent of the part does not exist. The comic old

a “Modern Faust,” just as Mr. Dick had King CHARLEs's trouble
in his head, only without the relief that had been invented for
Mr. Dick, namely, of putting King CHARLEs’s trouble into one
book, and his own work into another. - -
Absolutely nothing comes of this meddling with Faust except
muddling. Mr. HERMANN WEZIN, as Count Lestrange, looks some-
thing between a crushed tragedian, and a professional, conjuror-
“evening parties attended”—who, like the official from the Heralds'
College when he ; the procession into a hopeless tangle, “does not
even understand his own stupid business.” -
The motive of the play is the desire on the part of a certain, Lady
Luscombe to obtain from this sham-Mephistopheles, but real stage
villain of the old type, some, letters of hers, the publication ºf
which, as she is a widow with a º º character, cannot dº

Like a Portia who pleads for the Jew, since the wronged and the
hated is he
Who so hated and wronged in the past.
Put aside all the pitiful plaints, the reproaches, half malice, half
ear,
When the frenzy of rancour is stilled 'twill be time for cool reason
ear
And for Justice to settle at last.
But the horrible rage of brute hordes by the slack hand of Power let
slip,
The cºphistopheles smile on º: ºal lip,"
These Christendom fearlessly brands:
Tells Emperor, Prince, or dull Peasant 'tis £, ing a ruffian part,
To *: in such revels of shame, with the throb of black hate in the
eart,
And the red stain of blood on the hands.
A PUZZLER.
THE Globe (Jan. 16), in commenting upon the fact, that some of
the new buildings in Northumberland Avenue are built beyond the
line of frontage, says:-
“Any one standing between new buildings should be put back and rounded
off DRUMMond's and Cocks's will see at once that the differently to the
works in progress, so as to secure uniformity and an uninterrupted view.”
We confess we do not quite see what the writer is driving at. But
it certainly seems rather rough on inoffensive people who stand
between new buildings. If they are trespassing we can readily
understand they should be “put back;” but why, in addition to
this, they should also be “rounded off”—unless to convert them into
advertisements for our globular contemporary, it is impossible to say.

LOOKING IN THE CRYSTAL.
INVITED to assist at some experiments, by the Chairman and
Directors of the United Asbestos Company Limited, Your Scientific
Commissioner took himself to the Crystal Palace on Saturday, the
14th of º last. He was prepared to test everything placed
before him. He had a small but complete case of chemicals in his
left-hand coat pocket, and several electrical batteries in other
sartorial receptacles. He was ready to give the fruits of many
{..." of earnest study, to any matter requiring his attention. His
ead was as clear as a bell, his hand as steady as a mountain.
On reaching Sydenham, he was informed that the experiments had
been postponed, to suit the convenience of the LORD MAYOR of London
who was most anxious to be present at the luncheon. “The
Luncheon l’ murmured Your Scientific Commissioner, and he turned
with increased attention to the card of invitation that had been for-
warded to him. It was then that he read the following satisfaction-
creating words, “Luncheon at two o'clock in the Marble Hall, at the
south end of the Palace. Experiments immediately afterwards.”
The announcement did not take Your Scientific Commissioner alto-
gether by surprise. He had heard that the experiments were to be
connected with “the devouring element.” Your Commissioner felt
that he was quite capable of representing the Devouring Element.
Your friend Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM might have said “Elephant.”
It was not difficult to find the Marble Hall, Placards pointed the
way in all directions, “to the Asbestos Luncheon,” and assisted the
guests, in the discovery of the viands upon which they had been
invited to experimentalise. A goodly crowd soon congregated in an
ante-room, and were urged to apply “the devouring element” upon
some sherry and biscuits. While this interesting, “illustration” was
going on, circulars on green paper, giving the “list of invited
uests,” were distributed, so that those who were present should
earn the names and positions of their fellow-revellers. Then it was
that the guests j that “ — Jon Es, Esq.” was to be of the Fº
and the delight became almost delirious. Then it was that a
“Mr. BRowN’’ and a “Mr. SMITH" were both identified in the
catalogue, and the joy grew quite hysterical.
“Gentlemen,” said an aged reveller, “be kind enough to follow
the LoRD MAYoR and jš
The scientific body moved like one man, and soon had seated them-
selves at tables covered with dainties.
The first experiment had to do with soup. Two sorts were placed
before the savants—mock-turtle and jardinière—and both º
with equal rapidity. Then came five sorts of fish, which yielded as
readily to, “the devouring element.”. Then followed, entrées, re-
moyes, and sweets. All vanished as if by magic. Hock, sherry,
and champagne were laid on, but without any great effect. The
work of destruction seemed rather to increase than to degrease as
the liquid played into the glasses. ... Everyone seemed satisfied with
the experiments. Captain SHAw, the Life (Insurance) Guardsman,
tested the strength of the jellies to the utmost, and the LORD, MAYOR
seemed quite at home in knocking down the crusts of the rhubarb-
tarts. The Stage was ably represented by “HARE AND, KENDAL.”
the well-known firm of Solicitors—beg pardon—Theatrical Managers.
Later on, another semi-anonymous personage (who apparently was
“quite an amusing rattle”) put in an appearance—a gentleman
who signs himself. “MoxcKTON,” and who, R our Commissioner was
informed, is the Town Crier, or the Town Clerk, or something of
that sort, in the City. Altogether, the experimentalists formed a
very merry †
After the luncheon had been subjected to a thousand thoroughly
searching tests, the Chairman rose, amidst much cordiality, to
announce that there would be no toasts. He added something which
did not catch the ear of Your Scientific Commissioner, and the party
separated highly delighted with all they had seen, heard, and—last,
but not least–had tasted.
On the following day thetºº.” contained some interesting ac-
: counts of the doings of the United Asbestos Company Limited. No
doubt there was a good reason for these favourable reports. The
luncheon was excellent, consequently it is more than possible-nay,
highly probable—that the Fire-Proof Paint was quite inflammable.
At least this, after much careful consideration, is the deliberate
opinion of Your Scientific Commissioner, who subsequently got into
the wrong train, went fast asleep, dreamt that he “dwelt in marble
halls,” and woke up at Croydon.
THE BALLAD OF THE BAROMETER.
[On January 17 the Barometer was higher than it has been for forty years..]
“OH, what will be the weather?” the scared Householder would cry,
When seeing that his aneroid was waltzing up so high ;
“There’s º, that's remarkable about my calm thermometº;
But, hang me, if I know what’s come to-day to that Barometer!’
“What’s next P’’ the British Farmer said. “Here's one day wrapt
in gloom,
One cold and frosty, then one day strange flowers are out in bloom.
I test the strength of my cows' milk with what's called alactometer,
But that ne'er dances up and down like this insane Barometer.”
“The weather's queer,” the Tourist said. “One day my wraps Ineed,
The next I stroll along without my coat, from trammels freed;
I measure every stride I take by accurate pedometer,
And that I well can understand, but not this wild Barometer.”
The Meteorologist was charmed to see it upward rise. -
Quoth he, “This curious incident will cause some folks surprise.
But those who read the signs of storms, and use the electrometer,
Are not alarmed to see the tricks now played by the Barometer.”
But quiet folk exclaimed, “Oh dear, we're very much perplext!
What horrid atmospheric change can now be coming next
Does this portend a fall of snow, the advent of a comet, or
A fearsome storm * What does it mean, this rise in the |Barometer P’’

MR. PUNCH discovered, hospitably entertaining Gog and MAGog.
Mr. P. Well, Gentlemen, I should much like to hear what, from
your long *perience. you think of the proposal to abolish the old
Corporation
Magog. Abolish the Corporation 1 then abolish the House of
Lºrds, abolish the Monarchy, abolish the Rights of Property, abolish
all grand old customs, abolish us!
Mr. P. Ah, that would be sad indeed, especially if it included the
annual custom of counting the six horse-shoes and the sixty-one
nails, and the ...; of the faggots! But what say you, Mr. Gog?
Mix yourself another glass, and fire away.
. Gog (who helps himself as directed, and then fires away). Well,
Sir, you see MAGog is just a little impetuous, p'raps arising from his
always being on the hot side of the Hall, whereas, my place being on
the North side, I am naturally cooler, and can take a more rational
view of things, and I’ve long seen that something was coming,
and, in truth, that something ought to come, but abolition would be
simply monstrous. My Masters ain't perfect, no set of men can be
I suppose, but, from what I hears and sees, they do a wonderfu
amount of good in a quiet unpretending way. e Improvements
in the City Streets **** the last twenty years or so are somethin
wonderf MAGog and I generally take a stroll about once amont
or so to see how things are going on, and its really something extra-
ordinary. ... Look at Cannon Street, and Gresham Street, and Ludgate
Hill, and the Poultry, and the Holborn Viaduct, and think what
they must have cost, when I’ve sometimes heard 'em say they've
had to give a sovereign, a square foot for some of 'em. And then
how beautifully clean they’re kept! I've got a list here of someo
the things as they’ve done º: last fifteen years, which
perhaps you’ll allow me to read. (Reads.)
“They have, *ś that time, rebuilt Blackfriars Bridge. They
have purchased Southwark Bridge and freed it from toll. They
have erected three large Markets. They have housed 1,000 people in
comfortable healthy dwellings. They have restored their historical
Guildhall to all its pristine beauty. They have erected a magnifi-
cent Free Library and Museum, that were visited last year by nearly
400,000 persons, the º: had more readers than even that
of the British Museum. § are erecting a large and handsome
building for their admirable City School, on a site valued at £90,000,
which said school has had, and is having, a most brilliant, success,
equal to that of any public school of modern times. And all this
has been done without the cost. of a single shilling to the Rate-
payers either of the City or the Metropolis.”
Mr. P. And they have also erected, have they not, a worse than I.

Mr. P. You have taxes upon Coals and Corn and Wine, have you
not ? Surely these seem anomalies in these days of Free Trade?
Gog. Well, you see, Sir, money must be found somehow for im-
§. and as a man may eat 150 half-quartern loaves and
rink a dozen bottles of wine before his taxes amount to one penny,
that is not a very heavy burden. (Reads.)
* With their small tax of fourpence per ton upon coals, they have
made Cannon Street and the magnificent Holborn Viaduct, and with
the proceeds of a still smaller tax upon foreign corn—so infinitesimal
that a man must consume 75% quartern-loaves before his tax amounts
to a single farthing, and in exchange for which they willingly sacri-
ficed a revenue of £9,000 a year—they have been enabled to complete
the purchase of a beautiful Park of 80 acres at West Ham, one of
the poorest parishes in the whole Metropolis, with a swarming popu-
lation of 130,000 souls, to purchase beautiful Burnham Beec es, the
delight of our Artists and all lovers of Nature when seen at her very
best, to promise a contribution of £5,000 towards “Paddington
Park,’ and, far beyond all, to secure for ever for the healthful
recreation and enjoyment of the People, no less than 5,600 acres of
Epping Forest, doubtless the noblest recreation-ground in Europe!
** In addition to this, they have under consideration the preservation
of Coulsdon and the neighbouring Commons, of Banstead Downs,
and of Dartford Brent; and the mere knowledge that they are
always ready to come forward in all similar cases, prevents similar
attempts being made elsewhere.
“The Freedom of the City, although it may not be literally true
that, as the Marquis of SAIISBURY said, “it is an honour greater
than any in the power of the Crown to bestow, yet, it is no doubt
an honour highly prized and highly appreciated by all public men.”

call £h, but what many of our Dukes and Earls would call poor. I
am told that if the whole of it was taken from us and given to the
: Metropolis it would not save 'em more than a penny in the
pound.
Mr. P. Why not devote more of it to the encouragement of Art?
Gog. We do devote a considerable portion of it to Art. We have
the finest collection of Modern Sculptures, in the Kingdom, we have
lately established the most successful School of Music inthe Metropolis,
if not in Europe, and are about to establish a School of Art for
Painting and Sculpture. - -
Mr. P. Well, Gentlemen, I am much pleased with your visit, but
will not trouble you further to-night, -
Gog. There's one other matter, Sir, I should like to allude to.
Mr. Punch and his illustrious ancestors in Italy have always been
in favour of a greater mingling of classes than at present, exists.
Now what can be a greater step toward that desirable end than the
; of a tradesman of the City of London to the office of Lord
ayor
4 Mr. P. How so, Mr. Gog P Explain what you mean.
Gog. Certainly, Sir. A man who is elected Lord Mayor, steps out
of his warehouse, or out of his counting-house, or out of his shop
into the Mansion House, and then receives, as his guests, Royal
Princes, Ministers of State, Judges, Bishops, and even Marquises
and Dukes. - - -
Mr. P. Come, come, Mr. Gog' I think you are going a little too
far—are you not P Surely, no Lord Mayor steps from his shop to
the Mansion House ! -
Gog. Oh yes, he does, though, and sometimes hasn't far to go... I
remember very well when the QUEEN first came to Guildhall, Mr.
CowAN was Lord Mayor, and he sold candles just opposite the Mansion
House. He was a very small man, and when the QUEEN, first saw
him, she turned round to Lord MELROURNE, and said, “What a nice
little Lord Mayor l’ I suppose she sympathised with his small
stature, for she afterwards made him Sir John CowAN, Bart.,
despite his candle-shop. - -
Mr. P. Well, there really is something in what you say, though
perhaps not quite so much as you seem to think; however, I am very
glad to have seen you, and no doubt— -

To leave the fogs and mud of London, to leave the sombre gaieties
of English holiday time, and to exchange for them the warmth and
brilliancy of a Mediterranean winter, the laughter-loying life of the
children of the sunny South; this, indeed, is what the happy man
does who hurries via Paris and Marseilles to the delectable spot where
I am located. I am writing after a dainty, delicate, déjeńner, which
reminds me in its contrast to the monotonous, uninviting, breakfasts
of home, by an open window. Around it cluster pomegranate,
honeysuckle, and passion-flowers. The scent of jessamine is strong
on the balmy breezes, and the roses, and the myrtles, the lilies, and
the violets lend their fragrance. Before me are the calm, bright,
blue Mediterranean waters, reflecting a sky as azure as themselves.
Here and there are seen the white sails of the graceful feluccas.

DISTINCTLY PRECIOUS PANTOMIME.
DEAR Me. PUNCH,
A LETTER from “AN OLD CLowN,” which
recently appeared in your Contemporary, is all nonsense.
Clowns, if they wish to keep their place upon the stage,
must go with the times. They must become Æsthetic.
A long-haired Clown, a flabby Harlequin, an intense
Pantaloon, and a Burnes-Jonesian Columbine, would be
a great success. Fancy a lugubrious Clown singing the
following version of
HOT CODLINS.
SOME foolish *śP. quite famous they got
By posing, and talking—rot, rot, rot!
They made themselves Guys, not fit to be seen,
And they painted their walls a sad sage green;
They worshipped in silence their white and blue,
And their friends all said they were quite—
Da-do, daffodilly, silly-billy
Sunflower, Botticelli, quite Too-too!
These foolish young people, they cared not a jot ;
They thought they knew what was what, what, what
They painted poems they averred were good;
They sang sweet pictures that none understood.
And though it was said they had no common sense,
Everyone declared they were much too—
Da-do, daffodilly, silly-billy
Sunflower, Botticelli, quite Too-too!

HAMLET ON THE SITUATION,

CLóTURE or no Clöture ? That is the question:—
Whether ’tis better, on the whole, to suffer
The waste and worry of malign Öbstruction,
Or to take arms against the plague of Spouters,
And, by mouth-closing, foil them P To rise—to vote—
No more;—and, by a vote, to find we end
The boredom and the thousand wanton “blocks”
The Session’s heir to. 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished. To rise—to vote—
To voteſ Perchance to gag. Ay, there's the rub;
For from that Vote what tyranny may come,
When we have wriggled from Obstruction's coil,
Must give us pause. There's the consideration
That makes endurance of so long a life.
For who would bear the Ş. and quirks of BARTLETT,
Tart BIGGAR's tongue, O'DonnELL's contumely,
The gibes of gadfly GoRST, WARTON's delay,
The cheek of callow CHURCHILL, and the spurns
That patient ForsTER of rude HEALY takes,
When he to them might their quietus give
With a bare majority?, Who’d night-sittings bear
o yawn and faint for twenty weary hours,
But that the fear of after-hurt to Freedom,
That glory of our Country, whose wide bourn
No Liberal would limit, clogs the will
And makes us rather bear the ills we have,
Than fly to others that we may not measure ?
Thus Caution does make cowards of us all;
And thus the Statesman's native resolution,
Is hampered by the cobweb coils of doubt
And politicians of great pith and prowess,
From this reform their faces turn aside,
Dreading the name of—Cl6ture /

“ATTITUDE OF M. GAMBETTA.”
“WARE WIT!"
“Yesterday morning, while I was reading the English papers in one of the
leading cafés, two detectives entered, and requested that all copies of Punch
should be handed over to them immediately. Much to my regret, they left
with them in their pockets. Just imagine the progress which the German
bureaucrats have made! They now actually understand English jokes
written in the English language l’”—Daily News Correspondent at Berlin.
“SI un Allemand peut avoir de l'esprit” is an old cruz,
And it would not seem that Wit has yet contrived
O'er the Teuton's mental chaos to send forth that flat lur "
Which stupidity has never long survived.
How one pities these poor Prussians, high or low, all humour-blind,
Whom stern duty makes assayers, watchers, testers
Of that Jack o’ Lantern, Wit! Who is much surprised to find
That the Philistines are down on Jews and Jesters?
Geist well drilled is well enough, if it doesn't take to mocking
Great Panjandrums when they play the fool—'tis often;
But the nous that satirises—or succeeds—is simply shocking—
An offence that neither race nor grace may soften.
The alien who prospers, or who pleasantly pokes fun,
Has committed the unpardonable sin,
To which the sole *; er of each Great official Gun
Is the Dogberry ultimatum, “Run him in l’
Pruss v. Proteus P. 'Twill not do. Leave the Jester and the Jew,
Both too subtle for all bonds mere force can forge.
What can Iron do ’gainst Irony, or Blood against the True,
Though its fancy-winged defiance raise your gorge P
Thº,i strength that’s more enduring than the brawny might
or Edom,
Brute oppression pales at last before its star,
In the oldeternal conflict, still renewed, 'twixt Force and Freedom,
Truth and Wit are ever contraband of War !

* THERE’S LIFE IN THE OLD
BOY YET.”
(New Version. Dedicated to the Directors and
Shareholders of the London and South-
Western Railway Company.)
* SERIOUS ACCIDENT To A RAILWAY Port-
reR.—On Saturday last the oldest porter at
Richmond Station, JAMEs IstED by name, better
known as “Old JIMMY,’ was knocked down whilst
in the act of crossing the line, and sustained
serious injuries which will incapacitate him from
further duty, if indeed he should eventually re-
cover, which is somewhat doubtful. . . . IstED,
who is sixty-one years of age, came to Richmond
Station in 1847, the line having been opened to
this town on the 27th of july, isſé. He was
first employed at Nine Elms, and after that was
sent to Hampton Court, from which station he
was transferred to Richmond, where he has re-
mained ever since, a period of about thirty-five
years. The Company make no provision for their
old worn-out employés, who may go on till they
drop, or are knocked down and run over; but
alive to the importance of filling up the gap,
they have put on a boy, in the room of the old
man, at more economical wages.”—Surrey Comet.
FoR tº five years he has served them
well,
Though he's only a porter still, -
“Old º ” who's wellnigh worked his
spell;
He can't work, but someone will.
His duty's to swell the dividend—
He's part of the common “plant”;
He may come like a cur to his worldly end,
If he's told to work, and can't.
For the i. Directors must rule the line,
And the Shareholders pocket their due;
But a man who is spent, and his back rack
bent,
Is not thought of at Waterloo.
For thirty-five years he has battered along,
"Mid snow-storm and rain and fog :
When Steam was but weak, he was stout
and strong,
And now he must die like a dog.
Now that Steam is strong, he 's worn and
grey,
He has Hºt his manhood's prime,
And a tripling can do his work, they say.
Yes, he's quite outlived his time.

...And the Shareholders get their “per-cent.’

What matter if he be spent P
A SLOW-COACH RAILWAY COMPANY.
SIR,--It is with unmixed feelings of pain
and regret that I tell you my pitiful §
a story of the woes of a constant traveller
on the South-Eastern Line from London to
Woolwich and back again.
For me, time is money, and I try to catch
the hours as they fly, and turn them into
golden guineas, or half-guineas, as the case
may be. But for the Directors of the South-
Eastern, and, I presume, for the Share-
holders too, time is not money. They are
not slaves; so for the ridiculous sum of
half-a-grown, I am leisurely conveyed to
Woolwich, a distance of about ten miles, in
i. over an hour, and as leisurely
brought home again. Twenty minutes of
the hour are occupied on the journey (in-
cluding stoppages, unaccountable or other-
wise) to Cannon Street, where ten minutes
are allowed, for refreshment presumably;
as, for aught I know, the firectors havé
some such contract with the owners of the
refreshment-bar as exists at Swindon and
other half-way Stations, where delay is com-

HERBERT REEVEs. The
last appeared as a real
chip of the old block—
first-rate block too, still
and such a real head of
hair—at the first of Mr.
SIMS REEVEs's series of
Concerts at St. James's
Hall. The great tenor
was unable to sing all the
music set down for him,
but what he did sing,
viz.-‘‘My Pretty Jane”
and “The Bay of Bis-
cay”—was given in his
- own inimitable style; and
the latter was, both dramatically and vocally, as effective as ever.
Madame MARIE Roze was enthusiastically encored in her duet with
Mr. NICHOLSON as a mocking-bird per-
ched on his own flute, and hopping
from note to note in the most
delightfully impudent and irritating
manner. Shut your eyes, and there
was the Mocking-Bird; open them,
and there was Mr. NICHOLSoN.

refresh his apparently very treacherous memory P. The effect of the
song, as given in this way, is this:
Mr. B. F. (sings lustily)—
There was a jolly Miller once
Lived on the river—
(Suddenly forgets where on earth the Miller lived, and refers to book—oh,
yes, that’s it) ee ;
He worked and sang from morn till—
(Let me see—up to what hour did the Gentleman—oh, yes, by referring to
the printed book 1 remember it was —night,
No lark more blithe than he.

And this the burden of his song
For ever used to be,
“I care for nobody, no, not I—
(Let me see—is it “AND nobody cares "2–ah 1–of course—where is it 2
Ah, yes, that’s it—“I care for nobody, no, not I–IF"—sings defiantly)—
If nobody cares for me.”

º
In the intervals of the Concert we contrived to get to the Bristol
Hotel and avail ourselyes of the United Telephone Company's invi-
tation to ear-witness the performance of The Mascotte through the
telephone. We heard one of Miss CAMERON's songs, and a chorus,
perfectly; the only defect being that there seemed to be the gruff
voice of a grumpy person trying, to join very jerkily in the music
which came in atour left ear, and didn't go out at the other. Whether
the fault was with ourselves, or with the machine, or with some-
body in Mr. HENDERSON's company, we were at a loss to determine.
Could the gruff person's attempt have been the voice of that eminent
Yocalist, Mr. LIONEL BRoggh f It might have been so, as we heard
his dulcettones most distinctly at the commencement of the dialogue
when, by the way, everybody dropped the telephones with a sigh, an
resumed the conversation which had been interrupted by the necessity
for silence during the per-telephonic performance of the music.
.BLARE's carbon transmitters are fixed at the back of the Prosce-
nium on the right and the left, yet we didn't hear a single sound
when the Act-Drop was down and the carpenters must have been
setting the next Scene. Of course, unless Mr. ALEx. HENDERson's
Stage * has given the very strictest orders as to silence during
this interval, it was quite on the cards, though not included in the
programme of the telephonic entertainment, that a few energetic ex-
pressions from the Stage Manager or the master carpenter, or from
the prompter, when somebody or something wasn't quite ready might
have reached us; but we might have been present at the burial of Sir
John MooRE, when “not a sound was heard,” so mute was every-
thing and everybody until the Orchestra began to tune up. Alto-
gether we can safely affirm it to be the first and only time we have
experienced the sensation of a real “singing in one's ears” with
genuine pleasure. - - -
At Her Majesty's.--To announce a popular Opera like Qarmen is
sufficient to attract a big house; to let it be known that the public
will hear a really good all-round performance of it from Mr. CARL
Rosa's Company ought to be enough to double the attendance on the
occasion of its second representation. Shortcomings there must
be in satisfactorily carrying out such a difficult enterprise as this,
and we sincerely trust that Mr. Rosa's efforts will not go unre-
warded, and that at no very distant time, as there are theatres
.# up in all directions,
one of them at least may be de-
voted for nine months in the year
to Operas in English.
The notion that Operas must
necessarily be in Italian, that
their performance must be re-
stricted to singers with foreign
names, and that the enjoyment
of them must be confined to the
extremely-well-to-do-class, is,
we trust, fast dying out; and to
judge from the crowded appear-
ance of the cheaper part of Her
*º and, above all from
the judicious applause bestowed
on the performance, it is certain
that we have in London a public
as capable of appreciating a good

time in London, and achieved a marked success. She throws herself
into the part with thorough abandon, and is not afraid of bringing
out its flashes of comedy, nor of giving full play to its melodramatic
intensity. Yet in her anxiety not to lose a point she throws into
the Gipsy Girl somewhat too much the chic of an Opéra-bouffe
heroine, whose second nature is a habit of perpetually posing in
some attitude which she thinks would suit her best in a likeness
taken of her in costume by GR£vin, or by the Downey photographer;
A touch of this chic occasionally is quite in character, but it should
not be the pervading tone. This trifling fault we hold to be mainly
attributable to the high-heeled shoes. , Miss LA RUE's first twº Acts
were musically better than her third; but she finished well, and all’s
well that does that. - -
Mr. FRED. C. PACKARD sang Don José better than he played him,
being, rather too
dignified and un-
impulsive for a
lover. But we are
not prepared to
deny that this may
be the more cor-
rect reading of the
art of the dashing
ſoung Sergeant,
who has abandoned
a dying mother,
thrown over an
affectionate cousin,
and deserted from

the love of Carmen,

boots on a Regent Street pavement in July would be nothing by
Comparison. - - -

singing and acting. There was no heart about the great song; and the

to deliver the Irish people from this incubus of cowardly guilt.
Strange as it may appear we have not at the present moment an
little war on, of course always excepting Ireland. I cannot reca
any recent occasion when I have been able to meet you under simi-
larly cheerful circumstanges. -
You may at the outset have an uncomfortable feeling that since
we are not shooting anyone anywhere, or being shot ourselves, the
honour of England is being dragged in the dust. I am glad to assure
you that that is a perfect delusion.
GENTLEMEN OF THE House of CoMMONs,
The Estimates of the Services of the coming year are in a
forward state of preparation, and will be speedily laid before you.
Mr. GLADston E tells me he is º: have a pretty popular Budget.
I have º: in announcing that my youngest son Leopold has
contracted a matrimonial alliance in every way suitable. He will
now begin to appreciate the kind consideration which, on his coming
of age, led you to make him an allowance of £15,000 a year. That,
with the dowry coming to him with his bride, will make a nice
income for the .."; couple. If more is wanted, my children will
know where to look for help. -
I hope you mean to do a little more work and make a little less talk
than last Session. To that end a scheme will be propounded for the
amendment of the rules of debate. The discussion of this will afford
a favourable opportunity of showing how brief and business-like
may be your debates.
My LoRDs AND GENTLEMEN,
hen the Scheme alluded to has passed the House of
Commons, it is proposed that you should buckle to, and make up
some arrears in the business of the nation. Many Sessions have
passed since you had that opportunity in a full measure. When it
has not been Ireland it has been India; when it has not been India
it has been Africa; and when it has not been Africa it has been
Ireland. It is time to remember that there are other portions of the
Empire. One is England, another Scotland, and the third London:
We have had enough of Ireland for this generation, and sufficient of
Africa and Asia for what remains of the century. There is plenty
of work to be done at home, and I commend it to your consideration.
Among the subjects you will be asked to deal with this Session
are the Local Government of Counties, the Government of London,
Local Taxation, the Bankruptcy Bill, the Conservation of Rivers,
and the Preventing of Floods. There may be others that will be
brought forward in the course of the Session. But if you will settle
these, you will do more for .g. portions of the Empire than
hº been done during the preceding Sessions.
Wow,
My Lords AND GENTLEMEN, get to work forthwith, and
GENTLEMEN OF THE House of Contross, don't begin by squab-
g.
Mrs. Raº is getting on with her French...she ºys ºf detests

It is not till after

a way of avoiding

He is quite content not to be

when blindness is judicious and

might, for instance, reveal some
of the reasons why the building

blown asunder again at the ear-
liest opportunity — proceeds so
merrily, with immunity and profit

It appears that the Authorities in China, in a decree which a Cor-
respondentiustly defines as a “model one for a Paternal Govern-
ment,” inasmuch as in it “argument, entreaty, º
exposition, threats, are all mingled in due proportions,” have been
interfering with the Doctors' fees, and the price they charge their
patients for the hire of their chair-coolies. They also have intimated
their disgust at the Medical Professionin general, for their hesitation
about getting up at all hours in the night, and coming out in any
sort of weather; and are further inj at the fact that they object
to make their “round of calls” before One P.M. daily. In some
respects we seem decidedly in advance of our Mongolian brethren:

GAS AND WATER.
If, the Irish Land Act—(the 44th & 45th of Evictoria, cap. 49
should prove a success, there is no reason why the Legislature shoul
not push further in a similar direction. What is sauce for the Irish
gºose, Qught to be good sauce for the English gander. The abolition
of freedom of contract, the interference with the supposed rights of
#. the settlement by Act of Parliament—as in the beautiful
ackney Carriages Act—of the price which one man shall ask and
another man sh flººf. not to be Government luxuries be-
stowed only on ungrateful Ireland. Let England—of course, by the
kind...permission of. Mr. PARNELL–be treated to a little molly-
coddling legislation in exchange for a vastamount of direct, indirect,
and local taxation. Gas and water are the two first interests to be
experimented upon for the benefit of the multitude.
f the past misconduct and rapacity of certain Irish landlords can
justify the reduction of rentals from 25 to 50 per cent. under the
new Irish Land Act, surely the greediness of Gas and Water Com-
panies, who have failed to serve their victims with either the quantity
or quality expected, would justify a similar suspension of economic
law. The autocratic tone of monopolist advocates like Sir Edmund
BECKETT ought to encourage those weak-kneed Legislators who still
cling to certain Free-trade crutches. Considering the way the public
are treated º the Gas and Water Monopolists, the proposed measure

Counsel for the Prisoner. My Lord, the defence is that the Prisoner
was at least ten miles away from the scene of the crime at the time
it was committed. Therefore—
Judge (interrupting). Stop stop! This is most improperl What
right have you to state such a thing as that, without evidence?
Counsel. My Lord, I submit that I am here as the Prisoner's
mouthpiece—
Judge (angrily). And as such you’d better hold your tongue !
Don't you know, Sir, that the Judges have decided that Counsel

THE CORPORATION CASKET.
THE gold casket voted by the Common Council to Mr. GLADston E,
as a receptacle for the illuminated address presented to the PREMIER
a short time ago, is now finished, and is quite a chaste thing. An
eloquent description has been supplied to the daily papers, which if
it has a fault, deals too exclusively with the material envelope.
There is, if we may say, so, too much body and too little soul—too
much casket and too little illuminated address. For example, it is
said, “the design, which is of pure classic character, has its severe
lines broken by Tuscan columns at either end.”. This is emblematic,
and what it means is clear enough, though it might just as well have
been explained. The “severe lines” are obviously those of the
Ministerial majority, which are from time to time broken at either
end by Tuscan columns, led by Lord RANDOLPH or Mr. HEALY.
“The º is approached from either side by silver steps, with figures in
gold #. the four corners representing respectively Eloquence, Justice, Industry,
and Law.”
Persons approaching are requested to notice the mats at the feet
of the steps, and to use them diligently... It is only a rich Çor-
poration like that of London that can afford to have its trophies
approached by silver steps, and it is to be hoped there will be no
“nicking” with knives or other sharp instruments. . Eloquence is
of course represented by Mr. GLADston E.; Justice, by the Horſe

Ministry.
“In the front is a monumental tablet, bearing upon it the crest, arms, and
motto of the PREMIER, surrounded by the victor's wreath of laurel, enamelled
in proper colours, and flanked by female figures intended for the City of
London, Commerce, Ceres, and Ireland.”
We are glad that the colours are proper, and have little doubt the
female figures are not otherwise. It is a pleasant change to have

“The reverse front has in its centre, supported by the City dragons, the
following inscription.”
This was a fine opportunity of doing honour to the much-abused

"The lid is decorated with shields in proper colours, in gold and enamel,
with the arms of the City, Britannia, º British Lion, the Royal Standard,
the Union Jack, and the bust of Hoxſert, Mr. GLADstone's ideal author;
while the ends bear emblematic references to the PREMIER's varied gifts.”
The British Lion and Homer, Mr. GLADSTONE's ideal author, go
very well together. But we are not sure about the appropriateness
of the Standard. We should have thought that in §. connection
the Daily News, as being the only newspaper in:London steadfast to
Mr. GLApstone when he was in adversity and the Corporation
were º: caskets to Lord BEAconsPIELD, would have been more
appropriately honoured...That, however, is a mere flash of hyper-
criticism, which shows that we are accustomed to criticise objets
d’art. The ends bearing emblematical references to the PREMIER's
varied gifts, seem a little contradictory.
* Surmounting the whole is the Lamp of Learning, with the Owl, the bird

put it. On the whole, perhaps the finest effect in the whole design
is the expression on the face of the Owl, which, being shortsighted,
does not read the daily papers, and is evidently i.i. at a loss to
make out what it’s all about.

OUR HOTEL GUIDE.
IN travelling always choose what is called generally a Station or
Railway #. If you wish to be aroused for an early train; there
is no occasion to tell the “Boots.” The luggage traffic will #.
you awake, so that you can get up at any hour. A Railway Hote
nearly always belongs to a great Company, who leave the manage-
ment of it to servants. The servants may be good, or bad, but they
have this pleasant peculiarity,+they never care when you come or
when you go. There is no fussiness in a Railway Hotel—no over-
done cleanliness. You are not bowed in and bowed out by the land-
lord or landlady, and are not expected to wipe your boots when you
come in out of a muddy street.
Always choose an hotel with a high, Mansard roof, or some im-
posing style of architecture. There is always a satisfaction in paying
in your bill for a cloud-capped belfry-tower, of no use to anybody
but the architect and builder. You may think that a decent barber's
department in the hotel—a luxury confined to about four hotels in
the United Kingdom—would be of more practical value than the
belfry; but do not write to the papers, and say so. Nothing is got
by writing to the papers. More than a quarter of a century ago, the
late Mr. ÁLBERT SMITH ran a tilt against hotel charges, and espe-
cially the system of “tipping” servants... What has been the
resuſt? Tipping is not put down except in the bill under the name
of “attendance,” and the traveller has to tip the servants as
before.
When you require food, always order a fried sole and cutlet. It
saves a deal of trouble if you do not order, them, you will be sure
to get them. You know they are cooked with sawdust, which is not
an unhealthy though scarcely an appetising sauce, and it is always
well to know what you are eating. "Dry sherry, as provided at most
hotels, is a good penitential drink, and light hocks can be taken to
yary the physic. Coffee is like that sold at three half-pence a pint
in Bethnal Green and Whitechapel. People in these days reall
travel too much, and anything that tends to disgust them wi
travelling is probably a benefit.

with a red-hot poker.
all# yell ºf laughter followed each of these pleasantries. The fun grew faster
began to murmur ; they had laid in a good stock of

the rate the massacre was progressing it seemed not
unlikely that the demand for their articles of trade
would exhaust the supply. But the mob paid no heed
to their half serious, ºf: jocular remonstrances, and
continued their work right merrily. The houses were
burned and the Jews murdered with ever-increasing
heartiness.
By this time Houndsditch was consumed, and Old
Jewry, Shoreditch, and the other Hebrew quarters were
blazing fiercely. Suddenly an official on horseback rode
into the midst of the mob. He held up his hand for
silence. The crowd, weary of their exertions, paused
for a moment to listen to him. He smiled at the scene
around him, and then began to speak:–
“My friends,” said he, “I am sorry to interrupt you,
but I have come from Whitehall with a message. The
Home SECRETARY thanks you very much for all the trouble
you have taken in this matter, and begs to say that he
intends to inquire into the disgraceful conduct of the
Jews, which has merited this very just punishment.
And now continue your innocent amusement. And I
hope you will enjoy yourselyes.”
ith this the official rode away, leaving the mob to
return to their murdering and burning with renewed
cheerfulness, energy, and ingenuity.

THE FINE YOUNG LONDON GENTLEMAN.
III sing you a fine new song all about a fine young spark,
Who's a fine Young London Gentleman quite up to any lark;

Who's a real" dear old chappie,” as I needn't p’raps remark
Of a fine Young London Gentleman,
Quite of the present style.
He'll bet in “monkeys,” “ponies,” though he has seldom ready
cash;
If his Tailor isn't paid, yet he has rings and pins to flash;
At his fav'rite burlesque theatre he's known as “such a Mash,”
When to a fifth-rate Actress he bouquets down will dash.
Like a fine Young London Gentleman,
Quite of the present style.
He round the corner hurries when the sparkling piece is o'er,
To see his favourite Beauties coming out by the stage-door;
He will i. with his fellows to obtain a smile—nay, more,
To simply stare at her he's seen some hundred times before—
Like a fine Young London Gentleman,
Quite of the present style.
He will hie him off to .#. to join the dove battue :
He will “plank his pieces” down to join in battle with the Jew;
He will seek the same antagonist his" paper. to renew,
When he's had the bank at baccarat, or “lost the quids” at loo,
Like a fine Young London Gentleman,
Quite of the present style.

Like a fine Young London Gentleman,
Quite of the present style.
On a Racecourse he imagines that he knows what he is at:
He talks so scornfully of “mugs,” and says he knows a “flat;”
So wisely speaks of “roping,” and he always “smells a rat,”
But it very often happens that he's put “into a hat,”
Is this fine Young London Gentleman,
Quite of the present style.
But there comes a time when barmaids and when theatres are no go,
When the “Boy” is voted nasty, and burlesques considered slow,
When ev'rything too stale is, and wheniife has lost its flow,
And the spirits once so high become dull, sluggish, bad and low,
Of the fine Young London Gentleman,
Quite of the present style.
Then he recognises sadly there are others come, like he,

LORD AESCULAPIUS.
WHEN a Life-Peerage, is vacant, it usually falls to the lot of a
lawyer who is useful in the Court of Appeal in the House of Lords;
But why should not a Doctor sometimes be * ? Why should
a Baronetcy be the highest honour ever awarded to members of the
medical profession when, as the British Medical Journal pertinently
j the other day, Lord NAPIER is rewarded with a pension
and hereditary rank for defeating a king of savages P Mr. SPENGER
WELLs asked in a recent address, “Is Jºn NER or PAGET less worthy
of a Life-Peerage than any one of the eminent men who nºw sit ºn
the bench of bishops, or any of the lawyers, soldiers, or sailors who
have been rewarded by Hereditary Peerages.”. And the answer
must be, that these and other distinguished physicians are certainly
not less *..."; than members of the more fortunate º:
of the highest honours which the State can bestow, Qur Roya
Family owes much to the medical profession—notably His Royal
Highness the Prince of WALEs. Let him look to it one day, then,
that great physicians are admitted to the Peerage.

MORE O’ BALFE. garly panied for the most p
(At Her Majesty's and Elsewhere.)
BALFE's new Opera has for hero Sir Antony More; and to give
some, notion of this Artist's popularity, it will be enough to
mention that at the end of almost every important piece more was
called for. The much-abused encore-system is then in full vigour.
“More oh!” is the rather too facetious title of the work; the name
being apparently intended to remind the public that we have not
yet heard the last of BALFE.
If, indeed, we are to have all BALPE's Italian Operas of the last
º or forty years presented to usin an English dress, there will
not, for some time to come, be an end to so-called “new Óperas ” by
this composer-one 9f the most prolific of his day. No “leading
motives,” no “continuous ..i.d. ,” no “speaking orchestra,” no
Wagnerian nºnsense of any kind in “Moroº which is a good,
old-fashioned Italian Opera of the year 1854, full of what are vul.
guitar” style, so much despised by the great RICHARD.
The Opera was conducted by ¥. ARL Rosa, who must have
found the score distressingly full of those “easy things to under-
stand” which the hero of Locksley Hall could not abide. The
temptation of Sir Antony by the beautiful Olivia Campana, and his
persecution by the cruel Duke of Alva (whitened as Alba), form the
subject of the work; and the three principal personages are represented
with good effect by Mr. BART.on McGuckin (who for this occasion
º: from the concert-platform on to the stage), MadameWALLERIA,
and Mr. LESLIE CROTTY. The action of the piece takes place in the
Low Countries, where the base (or rather baritone), Duke of Alva is,
of course, quite at home. The exigences of the drama require, in
order to bring him into close relations with the painter-tenor, that
he should show himself a º patron of Art; and Alva orders
pictures freely from the future Sir Antony, who, on one trying
occasion, is called upon to paint, for the wicked Duke, the portrait
of that Olivia Campana whom he himself loves. -
Not that Olivia has nothing to do but to sit for her portrait. She
has to marry Count d'Aremberga, one of the Duke of Alva's fol-
lowers; to feign death, and invent an epitaph for her tombstone;
to enter a convent, undergo a trial for conspiracy, and get sen-
tenced to the scaffold ; to repel the advances of the Duke of Alva—
which recall those of the Count di Luna to Leonora in Il Trovatore;
to take part in more than one love-duet with Antonio Moro; and,
in the end, to sing one of those final rondos, without which in ancient
days no Opera was thought complete. The motive of the last Act
might have been set to a once popular song and introduced into the
Opera as a solo and chorus, thus:–
“Alva would a wooing go,
Heigho, sings Moro,
Alva would a wooing go,
Whether Olivia liked it or no,
With his scowling, growling, forté but naughty,
Heigho, sings Antony Moro.”
If a Parliamentary return could be moved for of the number of
Operas which, from the first performance of RossINI's Cinderella
until the establishment of the influence of VERDI, were made to
terminate with a rondo finale, the return would, in the first place,

would be seen that a very large proportion, indeed, of the Operas pro-
ăuced between 1813 and (about)1853 were brought to a conclusion by a
highly florid air for the herºine, whose heart was “bounding” with
“ Jºy astounding,” or “dancing” with “love entrancing,” or “leap-
ing” with “no more weeping.” When, at the close of her adven-

pinions differ as to the treatment that the Duke of Alva has
received in the new Opera; for while one critic declares that he has
been made worse, than ever—the librettist representing him as a
would-be lady-killer as well as a slayer of men—another maintains
that the pleasant, genial strains which BALFE has witten for the
part have had the effect of rehabilitating him. Mr. CROTTY's singing
is in every case much better than the Duke of Alva's conduct.
This Opera contains one or two very dramatic scenes; and the
meeting of the Council of Blood would be terrifying—the villanous-
looking ecclesiastics with balloons on their heads are enough to
frighten the boldest person—but for the light and agreeable music
by which the proceedings are enlivened. A pretty divertissement
was not the less welcome because the dancers wore Spanish costumes
and danced in the Spanish style. History is mute on the subject;

while devoting himself with commendable exertion to the task of
popularising WAGNER, Mr. CARL Rosa deserves great credit for not
neglecting the already popular BALFE.
Mr. Boosey’s “Night wi' BURNs” was very Scotch; Scotch by its
ballads, and Scotch also by the mist which filled the hall. The
congenial fog had no effect, however, but that of stimulating the
audience to applause, renewed again and again. Miss Hope GLENN,
of the Italian voice, made on this occasion her first appearance as a
Caledonian vocalist. Fortunately the Scotch accent, so difficult to
acquire, can, by
singers not to the

RED FIRE FOR BLUEMANTLE.
REFERRING to the composition of the Special Deputation re-
cently appointed by the German Emperor to convey to the SULTAN
the insignia of the “Most distinguished and lofty Order of the
Black Eagle.”—the Garter of Prussia—a Contemporary points out
that not only is it remarkable in the matter of rank, since it includes
a Prince or two, and apparently a Monarch, and some ancient
dynasty alluded to in the official list as “Captain HENRY_XVIII.,”
but that considered in its highest light as a bit of diplomatic
theatrical display, it is perhaps quite unsurpassable.
* As regards soldierly physique, and variety and impressiveness of uniform,
no better selection of special Envoys could have been made, and the Oriental
mind, they say, is singularly susceptible to outward magnificence and show.”
It is to be hoped that after this European coup de théâtre in the
very heart of Stamboul, the reviving foreign Bondholders will get
their promised half per cent. regularly. Meantime, might not the
Authorities at Heralds' College take a hint P It is admitted on all
hands that the ceremonial connected with the investiture of our own
time-honoured Garter, when conducted by commission in a Con-
tinental capital, never fails, by reason of its wildly grotesque
characteristics, to produce peals of laughter, spite every effort of
local etiquette to take the honour seriously, Garter King-at-Arms,
in full dress, is apparently irresistible; and the other day at Madrid
it is well known that everybody concerned was in uncontrollable fits.
As the ceremony is about to be, if not already, repeated in the case
of His unoffending Majesty the King of Saxony, could not someº
thing be done on the Prussian lines in the way both of “physique”
and of “variety, and impressiveness,” too? Why not, in addition to
the usual official announcement that the
“Earl of FIFE and Sir ALBERT Woops will be accompanied by Mr.
George Cockayne, Lancaster Herald, and Mr. Edwaad BELLAsis, Blue-
mantle Pursuivant of Arms,”
can it not be intimated that “H.R.H. the Duke of CAMBRIDGE, a
couple of Beefeaters, the Hall-Porter at the Criterion, and the Lobo
MAYor, firmly secured on the back of one of Mr. SANGER's largest
and freshest elephants, also joined the distinguished party at the
last moment.” Such a following, together with a little judicious
red fire let off at intervals during the progress of the proceedings,
could not fail to impress everybody. German “ideas” are always
worthy of respectful attention; and if it is not too late, and His
Saxon Majesty has not already been holding his sides, while the Earl
of FIFE has been shaking in convulsions over his Royal knee, some-
thing might yet be done to rescue the most honoured and ancient
distinction in Europe from that region of broad farce into which it
seems slowly but surely to be settling.

BELIEVE me, I'd shatter the indolent fetters
That long have enchained me and held me too fast;
I'd earnestly try to reply to my letters,
That should have been answered the week before last;
I'd get up betimes, and I ne'er would be surly,
Nor slumber till Twelve like an underbred Fº
I wouldn't play pool, and I’d go to bed early—
But can't on account of the Fog.'
I'd square up at once with that man in the City,
And even I’d ask Uncle Foozle to lunch :
Oh, I would be wise, as I always am witty,”
And finish at once those smart papers for Punch.*
No more at the weather would I be a railer;
No longer our climate I’d ceaselessly slog.
I'd settle at once with my hatter and tailor—
But can't on account of the Fog.'
I'd go and take part in the dreariest of dinners,
The prosiest praters I’d ne'er try to snub ;
And Böneweiſ would find me the best of ali grinners
At all the old stories he tells at the Club.
At slow Kettledrums I would often be present,
And talk like a fool or a prim pedagogue;
To rudest relations I’d sometimes be pleasant—
But can't on account of the Fog /
I'd pay all those calls I so long have neglected,
And highest º: deservedly earn;
And do proper things such as none e'er expected—
That borrowed umbrella at once I’d return.f -

Mary Anne to Matilda Jane.
HAVE you read this here hadvertisement, my own MATILDA JANE,
Which the meaning though it’s scandalous is also very plain.
They seems to think there’s not a bit of “go” with servant-girls,
And as they used to skimp chig-nongs they wants to skimp our
curls.
Oh! it's shameful and it’s awful, for pray why should we befrights,
If a Parlour Maid gets wages, yet she likewise has her rights.
Now there’s Missus such a dowdy thing, with hair that’s Lifeguard
red,
Yet she always lays the curling-tongs about her lobster head;
She will curl and trim her locks, till I’ve often seen them singe;
But she won't let me have what she can't, a lovely wavy fringe!
Oh!, it’s shameful, and it's awful, and, in fact, I'd like to swear,
To think a Parlour Maid mayn't cut or frizzle up her hair!
And then there's my brave BENJAMIN (a Constable, of course),
Who's the Terror of the Burglar, and the Honour of the Force.
He says (he’s such a learned chap) my hair is like the Greeks,
And now I musn't please him, on account of henvious sneaks!
Oh! it’s shameful and it’s awful, and I really do declare
If things don't change I’ll lose my place, and still stick to my hair.
They may say there's on the Registry of Parlour Maids a glut,
But they can't be in the Fashion if their hair in front's not cut;
And as I’ave said before (being English born and free),
I means tº beautify myself just as it pleases me.
For it’s shameful and it’s awful that a Missus should and can
Tell how she means to cut the fringe of Your own

DONS AND DRUMS,
Owng to the enterprise and energy of the several Royal and dis-
tinguished Personages who have taken the movement in hand, there
is little doubt but that a National College of Music, established on a
wide and permanent basis, will before long be an accomplished fact.
It is already announced that the Prince of WALEs, who is evidently
determined to countenance no half-measures...in. 3. with the
matter, has convened for the 28th inst., what will, if merely decently
attended, prove little, short of a monster meeting, to discuss the
subject. His Royal Highness, it appears, has intimated that he will
be glad, on the occasion in question, to assemble around him at St.
James's Palace—
—“the Lords Lieutenants as the representatives of the counties, the Mayors
as #. of the towns of the United Kingdom, and the Archbishops
and Bishops and the clergy of various denominations,”
for the purpose of introducing them all, then and there, to
“the most eminent musicians, the most eminent music-publishers, the most
eminent musical-instrument-makers, and, lastly, distinguished amateurs and
the most influential patrons of music.”
Such a gathering as this has not been seen since the signing of
Magna Charta; and if not only a College but a complete Musical
University does not prove the immediate upshot of its deliberations,
it will not have been from any want either of thoroughness or of
hearty co-operation on the part of its illustrious promoter.
Meantime, Mr. Punch, who doesn't know whether he mayn't look
in, and take a degree or two himself, when the thing is fairly started
offers the following preliminary suggestions for the guidance o
those about to set it on foot. Some fhis hints, if not fresh, may at
least be of use to a provincial Mayor, or even to an Archbishop,
who, notwithstanding a very limited familiarity with the technical
details of the matter in hand, finds himself suddenly called on to
express his opinion before the St. James's Palace º; on the
approaching 28th. Mr. Punch, therefore, subjoins the following
random, but valuable, jottings, with confidence and pleasure:—
Rough Mems. for the Formation of a Musical University.
(1) Buildings.-These should be on the good old, college lines,
with plenty of open spaces. The usual Gothic triangle, surrounded
by flats, should be the model. Advanced Students might be rele-
gated to a block in seven flats, and they might be hauled up to the
top storey *} suspended chords. No two doors should ever have the
same key. This for practice. In the grounds, too, there might be,
here and there, a five-barred gate. This would enable those who
felt inclined to take a five-bars' rest.
(2) The Vice-Chancellor.—The dress of the Vice-Chancellor will be
simple and appropriate. It will be trimmed with counterpoint lace,
and he will never be expected to appear in public without his brass
bands. . His general attitude will be dominant; but he will be
expected to have some member of his fºilº the º and to
supply himself with his own relative Major. When ailing, however,
he will receive diatonic treatment, free of charge. To light his bed-
chamber candle, he will use Solfa matches. -
(3) The § Hall.—This will be easily º. from all
parts of the building by conveniently constructed staccato passages.
and an excellent tone will pervade all the general arrangements. No
bottled ale will be allowed, but double Bass, though Meyerbeer will
be served in French horns to those that ask for it. Devilled trom-
bones will be served for supper, and the plate will be fiddle pattern.
(4) Gentleman Commoner.—Any student with a Handel to his
name, will be able to enter as a Gentleman Commoner.
(5). Recreation.—Ample opportunity will be afforded for recrea-
tion, but no undergraduate will be eligible for the Eleven who is not
prepared to make his own vocal score, execute a series of brilliant
runs, and give the ball the proper musical Fº As at Cambridge,
the grounds immediately É. the Hall and buildings will be
known as the College Bach, and here in winter Prisoner's Bass will
be played at imperfect intervals.
(6) General.--Though free from crotchets, the Principal will feel
himself responsible for the moral and social training of the students
under his supervision. He would not, therefore, be likely to accept
a run up to town to see an eminent Bond Street Publisher in dis-
tress, as an equivalent to an “attendance, at Mourning QHAPPELE.”
Credit will be discouraged, and no undergraduate, whatever his
genius, will be allowed to arrange a composition of his own with his
creditors. On the same principle the Owe-boy will be banished
from the orchestra... Lastly, though unpolitical in its aims, the
tendencies of the institution, following the lead of the Paris Conser-
vatoire, will be strongly Trova-tory.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE YOUNG MAN FROM THE COUNTRY AT
THE PLAY.
RESPECTED P., I took your advice, and went to see the School for
Scandal at the v.i. I took ToMKYNs of Balliol, who is an
awfully clever chap. Having presented a nice º: lady a nice
sixpence for a nice programme, containing all the names and
addresses of some of the principal decorators, upholsterers, and
furniture-makers in London, I saw a vast collection of tables, and
chairs, and clocks, and looking-glasses, just like a Bond Street Art-
shop; and mixed up with these was my Lady Sneerwell, who wore
a mustard-coloured wig (mind you, she was a Lady of the deepest
dye), º: nasty things, in a hard voice, to a kind of aconite-and-
arsenic-looking c ... Snake. Then entered a plum-coloured
Footman, who, however, turned out to be the villain of the play.
This was Joseph Surface, played by Mr. ARCHER, whose render-
ing of this part Tomkyns told me, was “subtle; ” but he struck
me as too quiet and insipid, even when he was not required to
disguise his villanv.

became a bit livelier when a funny, and festive old lady,
Mrs. Sugar Can—I mean Mrs. Sterling-Candour, began to tell
stories for which she would most undoubtedly have been “sconced"
had she told them at our Common Room.
Crab-Thorn-Tree was sour, and wrinkled, and brown. ToMKYNs
tells me he is the boss of this show. He speaks with a curious little
husky *g, * the beginning of every sentence, which is ver
comical. Sir Benjamin Backbite was played by a gentleman Nº.
a Chinese name, and an effeminate snob he was. ToMKYNs said
“his foolish, vapourings were in the true spirit of the Macaroni
of the period.” We all pretended to agree with Tomkyns, as he
knows a lot.
Well, Sir, these people told no end of queer stories, and talked
anecdotal foolishness, and went on much the same as everybody does
nowadays, and then, a house game down into the j. of the

painted books. Then, as she spoke from the back of the stage, her
voice came down to us so tenderly and wistfully that it shut up the
boys' laughing, and that’s saying a great deal. And the way she
withered up the plum-coloured Mr. Hypocrite, and refused to back
ARCHER at any price, was º scorching. I don’t see though
why she should be discovered in such a carefully posed statuesque
attitude. Surely at that moment Lady T. would have tried to
make a bolt of it, and she might just be caught in the instant of a
dash for the door which is close at hand. The position of this door
is a mistake." (ToMKYNs says all Lady Teazles stand like that,
and that it’s “traditional:”—hang tradition')
This is the crack scene of the play, and everybody plays it well;
but I think Charles was wrong to come in and bow to us after his
jolly laugh at the bewildered trio. (Tom KYNs says it is a “tradi-
tional call”—that's ToMKYNs all over !
Mr.NEVILLE is a rattling, cheery, dashing chap. Go and see how
he sells all his ancestors to his Uncle (no, not what you mean, but
something like it), all but an ill-looking little fellow over a settee—
a kind of spidery sofa, and note how tenderly he bends over that
scrubby little picture, and flicks the dust from it’s face with a lace
handkerchief—that loving flick was “good business” for Charlie in
more ways than one.t
This Uncle Oliver was evidently meant by the fellow who wrote
the play to be a jolly old boy with a warm heart and a taste for
amateur theatricals, but Mr. MACLEAN's notion of him was harsh,
surly, and grumpy. ToMKYNs says he is a very steady and con-
scientious actorſ. He’s a deal too steady and conscientious for
Uncle Oliver. ToMKYNs says the Rowley for this Oliver (often
wondered where this proverb came from) is an old bore, who
ought to be superannuated. He creeps in and out of the play with
a benevolent smile; and, when he gets a chance, sticks his hand on
his hip, crooks his off leg, and poses and proses to his heart's content;
It seemed to me he was just the sort of nuisance such a confidential

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
SONG AND SUPPER.
BETwFEN Popular Concerts, as given at St. James's Hall, and Con-
certs for the People as given at the Victoria Hall, New Cut, and
Foresters' Hall, §... the difference is as great as the cele-
brated one between a horse-chestnut and a chestnuthorse. There can
be no doubt as to which of the two kinds of entertainmentis the chest-
nuthorse. The excellent music performed on Saturdays and Mondays,
i. also on Wednesdays, at the so-called “Monday Pops,” is,
however, of the class known as chamber-music, and in that character
has the appropriate effect of sending some persons to * It is
useless to deny it; for the sleeping ones may be seen and, when not
too numerous, counted. It is, above all, at the evening or after-
dinner concerts, that the sad spectacle may be observed of worthy
men struggling against the combined effects of too much gas, in-
sufficient ventilation, a full meal, and a string quartet. These feeble
amateurs, should try the Morning Concerts which, without bein
less perfect as regards music, are, as regards temperature, muc
cooler than the evening ones. To true music-lovers, however,
the playing of Madame NoFMANN-NERUDA, of Signor PIATTI and their
associates, would be welcome at any hour of the day or night.
Quartet music and the best kind of pianoforto music, however
“ popular” it may be with a comparatively small portion of the
ublic, would worry and stupify “the people; ” and at the People's
Xoncerts the programmes are made up of songs and ballads to which
the word “popular,” used in its ordinary sense, might fairly be
applied. The popular character, however, of the Concerts for the
People may soon be destroyed if the aristocracy, and even Royalty, in-
terfere with them. Such interference is really taking place, for y
CoLIN CAMPBELL (a charming vocalist) has already sung twice at
the Foresters' Hall, while the Victoria Hall was honoured last
Thursday with the presence of the Prince and Princess of WALEs.
At these concerts no intoxicating drinks are sold-a peculiarity
which, it is true, may also be observed at the Philharmonic, the
Monday Populars, and other concerts given at the West End. But
the Concerts for the People are addressed in particular to the fre-
quenters of Music Halls, who think no place of entertainment com-
plete without a bar—though what would a Music Hall be without a
few bars' rest?—and who, like a certain benighted Californian
settler, would expect to find one even in a place of worship. Smoking
is allowed, and the temperance system has already found some
strong “backers.” There's room for all.
If Mr. SIMS REEVEs had lived in the days of the Persian king who
offered a prize for a new pleasure, he might well have put in a claim
for the reward. He has at least invented a new kind of concert, to
which he might lºg haveº, his own name, but which he pre-
fers to describe as “National, Operatic, and Miscellaneous.” This
novel entertainment is made up of national ballads, operatic airs,
and songs of various kinds; and the tenor music included in the
£º. covers so wide a range that no one but SIMS REEVES
with his comprehensive grasp could possibly do justice to it. At
last week's “National, Operatic,” &c., the national feature was
“Tom Bowling,” and the operatic one a selection from MACFARREN's
Fobin Hood. The manliness and pathos which Mr. REEVEs infused
into his delivery of the English ad were beyond praise; and
“Tom Bowling” was the success of the evening. The Robin Hood
performance was like a return to ancient times; for the principal airs
were sung by the same artists who sang them u *:::: of twenty
§. ago when the opera was first brought out. Mdme. LEMMENs-
HERRINGTON was once more Maid Marian, Mr. SIMs REEVEs
Robin Hood, and Mr. SANTLEx Friar Tuck. The Friar wanted a little
padding to look the part, but his voice was as full and round as ever,
... The Philharmonic Society is frequently “chaffed” on account of
its age; and it admits in its programmes that its years now number
three score and ten. . Its pertory, however, numbers scores
without limit; and it is about to be increased by the addition of
several new ones. It may be doubted whether the two-year old
Orchestral Concerts of HERR RIGHTER, and the Orchestral Concerts
as yet unborn, but confidently expected this season, of Mr. CHARLEs
HALLſ, and Mr. WALTER MACFARREN, will be as full of life lºy
years hence as are the old Philharmonic Concerts in the present day!
Nothing new at the opening concert, unless the first appearance in
ublic of the newly-formed Philharmonic Choir can be so considered.

THE REASON WHY.—The Statue of good Queen ANNE, at St. Paul's,
who turns her face to the public, and her back to the church, has
been mutilated by a madman. Ön inquiry, it was found that he
was formerly an inmate of the Stone, Lunatic Asylum... It is said
that he was 50 irritated at this being the only ungrammatical Statue
in London; because whereas any other Statue is “A Statue,” this
is always “Anne's Statue.”
“THE DUMB DOGS’ DOOM.”
“* * * * on going to kennel the men found the animals [The Western
Foxhounds] afflicted with dumb madness. The veterinary surgeons called in
pronounced the disease so virulent in form that they ordered the whole pack
to be destroyed.”—Evening Paper.
As to the Weather and the Crops, the Farmers own the Weather
Has lately all that could be wished for the Crops been altogether;
But fogs which never hurt the fields oppress the respiration,.
And cause catarrh, with cough and bark of bronchial irritation;

Cough, cough, continually-Bow, wow, wow !
The genuine canine utterance has stood, meanwhile, suspended,
In a case which, fully stated, might perhaps be comprehended,
But, considered as an incident of late and |. history,
Remains, to be accounted for, a marvel and a mystery.
Bow, wow, wow !
What could have choked the chorus–Bow, wow, wow P
The Western Foxhounds—name to none in all the kingdom yielding-
'Squire Western of eternal fame, immortalised by FIELDING-
On Saturday appointed were to hunt—as man disposes-
Ne'er fox to scent that Saturday did those dogs set their noses—
Bow, wow, wow !
No more, never, never—Bow, wow, wow !
The huntsmen to the kennel came with usual joy and gladness,
When lo! they found the animals all affected with dumb madness;
Within a night, the whole struck dumb, at once and altogether.
What could the cause have been if not the damp and foggy weather?
Bow, wow, wow !
Ah, no, they never answered—Bow, wow, wow !
The Wets with virulent rabies pronounced the pack infected,
And ordered its destruction, done as shortly as directed: .
Of course, if there exists the slightest doubt about dogs' sanity,
The benefit of the doubt mankind must always give humanity.
Bow, wow, wow !
Die dogs unable to cry Bow, wow, wow !
Yet should we always—could we lift the scientific curtain-
Find mute with mad convertible in kennels quite for certain *
Had not the Western Foxhounds that were put to euthanasia,
But a simultaneous seizure of the new disease, Aphasia #
Bow, wow, wow !
No saying—e'en so much as Bow, wow, wow !
A Missing Paragraph in a Certain Speech.
“BEING very much pained at the frequent outrages on unoffend:
ing animals in Ireland, and not being quite certain what branch of
my Government, if any, is capable of stopping these outrages, I
wrote to Lord NEyeRDARE, as President of the Society for... the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and had a most pºlite note from
his Lordship regretting his inability to cure the evil.”

STEMMING THE PANIC.
You told me there was a Panic in the City. You also told
me that it was my duty to stem it. On my requesting from you the
casual loan of a Million wherewith to stem the Panic, you made use
of remarks calculated to injure both the Panic and myself in the eyes
of unbiassed observers. But I went to the Panic.
Arising in the middle of the night, I chartered a speedy hansom
and was in the City at an inconveniently early hour. Amongst other
F. to which in your wrath you had directed me was “the fountain
ead.” I went to the fountain-head, to my fountain-head. My
fountain-head is somehow engaged in Jute, but whether he sells,
buys, borrows, lends, or even steals Jute, I know not. What I do
know is, that Jute is good business; that if you are wise you will
take 6 to 4 about Jute till the Ring is tired ; that when you ask for
Jute you must see that you get it; that Juté only strikes on its own
box; that, despite obstinate fogs and carefully-nurtured fire Panics,
the receipts for Jute are £2000 this week, as against £1500 for Jute
this week last year; that if Jute will only return to his, her, or its
wife and º all will be forgiven; that if the heirs or next of
kin, to Jute will only apply anywhere, they will hear something to
i. own advantage; and that no Jute is sold without the trade-
mark-
“How does he Jute,
How does he Jute,
How does he Jute so free?”
I found my Jute friend, and knowing that time was money in the
City I j him, g y
*How is the Panic **
He replied,
“I show you.”
We left his office, and entered a house which, by the number of
merchants who were entering and departing, must be one of the
most important places of business in the City.
“Come down-stairs,” said my friend, “and I will show you not
only one but several Panics.”
I went down-stairs, and saw the Panics.
Panics are somewhat like overgrown tortoises. When Panics are
not wanted, they are kept in tanks; when they have to be stemmed
rapidly, their throats are cut. So a man in white told me.
“To stem this Panic properly,” said my friend of Jute, “we must
go up-stairs.” And bowing to his superior City knowledge, we went
up-stairs. There we encountered other City gentlemen also engaged
in stemming the Panic. One was so devoted to the task that he had
sat up all night, playing baccarat with the Jews. Another had dis-
guised himself, in a white waistcoat, as a butler from the very house
we were then in, and had attended eleven consecutive performances
at the Gaiety. Theatre, . And yet another had saved the City by
refusing to sell tea, and buying oil of cinnamon in its place.
Talk of stemming the Panic. It was not a feat to be accomplished
with the ease which West-End writers seem to think is sufficient.
Words first, quiet words, then strong naughty words, then almost
blows, before it was arranged whether vinegar by itself, or cayenne
pepper and lemon, or even a drop of “the Boy,” as suggested by
your CITY EDITOR.
[Look here, we must draw the line somewhere. We engaged a youth, who
said he knew a lot of men in the City, to describe the Panic to us. As far as
we can make out, he was given lunch in the City, and saw no more of the
Panic than we did. Still we will give him one more chance.—ED.]

THE DISTRICT SURVEYOR.
MR. PUNCH has not had to pause long for a .."; He has
received one not º from a District Surveyor, but from one of
high degree, with no less than five mysterious letters after his name
and who claims for his associates or predecessors, Presidents and
Vice-Presidents of the Institute of British Architects, Professors of
Architecture at King's and University Colleges, F.R.S., &c., &c., &c.
So much to prove their respectability, and as to their high
character, he states, with somewhat grim humour, as a proof of its
spotless, purity, that they all, Presidents and Vice-Presidents
included, have to sign a declaration, that they “will take no bribes
or trade commissions on pain of expulsion,”—if found out.
The District Surveyor makes out a better case for himself and his
Colleagues than Mr. Punch, from his previous information and
observation would have thought possible, laying the blame for the
evils that are so patent to all, to want of sufficient power to control
the acts and deeds of Jerry Builders and grasping Landowners.
To remedy this state of things he asks for that powerful assistance
that Mr. Punch can, so we *ś help in the apparentl
impossible task of passing through the Legislature a useful and muc
needed measure that will give more power to the elbows of his class.
º: when H. M. Government have quite done with that
terrible Mr. BADLAw, and with proposing doubtful measures that
nobody wants, and nobody cares about, they may find a little time
for useful and necessary legislation, such as that suggested by
Mr. Punch's Correspondent, the District Surveyor, F.R. *
Mr. Punch having directed one of his young men to inquire
further into the matter, he has gathered the following particulars,
which may interest those of the Public who are in a blissful state of
ignorance in this respect.
There, seem to be some sixty-seven of these Gentlemen in the
Metropolis, with fees ranging from £2,500 a year in Fulham or
Hammersmith, to some £300 a year in Clerkenwell. The total
annual amount received by them yearly being just about £50,000.
Whether what is done by these Gentlemen is worth £50,000 a-year,
is a matter upon which Mr. Punch's young man yery properly
refrains from giving an opinion; but in the course of his inquiries
he learnt that while some of them seem somewhat lax in the per-
formance of their duties, others display a degree of energy perfectly
astounding.
For instance, he found that in the City lately, when a fire occurred
in Cheapside, the astonished Commissioners of Sewers found them-
selves served with no less than nineteen different Reports of dan-
gerous structures, all arising therefrom, and each entailing a separate
Feel . No complaint of want of energy there, by the Powers, but
something like a slight superabundance.
Upon the whole, Mr. Punch does not regret that he called atten-
tion to this matter, which will doubtless have the effect of stimulating
the slothful and curbing the fee-hunger of the over-zealous in the
performance of their important duties.
THE MOHOCK REVIVAL.
THIs is an age of reproductions and revivals, and amongst the rest
that ancient form of ruffianism known as Mohockism appears to
have broken out with more than ancient severity in various parts of
London. While people are whipped to death on the Thames Em-
bankment, stabbed by armed mobs, at Hoxton, hunted down at
Hackney and Islington, beaten black at Whitechapel and blue at
Bethnal Green, we almost feel a delicacy in alluding to “outrages”
in Ireland, or kicking in Lancashire and Derbyshire. To quote
Mr. John BRIGHT, with a slight difference, is the Police Force no
remedy, or must we all carry revolvers?...Perhaps the Seldom-at-
Home Secretary, when he can spare time from surveying the world
from China to Peru, will kindly answer this?

THE year 1892 opened in ominous gloom. The prohibitive duty on
Mixed Pickles had fallen on the Nation like a thunder-bolt. But
there had been no hesitation. War had been declared, and the
Channel Tunnel, as a menace to the security of the Empire, was at
last about to be put to the test. Not that the Authorities at the
Horse Guards had been idle. A breech-loader had been hurriedly
mounted on the heights of Dover, the Duke was busy over a new
facing, and five Artillery Volunteers, fairly equipped, were watching
the entrance to the subterranean passage from the summit of
St. Catherine's with a powerful secondhand field-glass.
But it was a terrible and tempestuous night, and though they had
§. the focus they saw nothing. Then they turned in “The
renchmen will scarcely emerge from the tunnel on an evening like
this,” said the Lieutenant in command. “At least, I don't think
so,” he added, with soldierly caution. In another minute the gallant
band were asleep, refreshing themselves for the struggle of the
morrow, and dreaming they were once more º smiling children

There was a sound as of five military bands, playing an operatic
selection together under the direction of an experienced con uº;
slowly issuing from the tunnel's-mouth. “It is the signall’
remarked a handsomely bronzed middle-aged gentleman, who, in a
dark-green º: uniform, and moun on a well-trained
railway omnibus horse, was directing the movement of some fifteen
hundred heavily armed, but portly troops, who had now taken up a
position, that effectually commanded and protected the approaches
to the dark submarine roadway. “It is the signall” he repeated,
his eye kindling as he spoke, “and they are nearly through We
have only to keep the entrance clear, and prevent any molestation
for five minutes more, and then the enemy will be safely out of it,
and our fº engineering enterprise will, thank heaven be still
reserved to us, and capable of yet paying the usual half-yearly

His sturdy followers gave a hoarse cheer. They felt that
whatever became of their country, their capital at least was still
their own. It was a stirring scene. Some of them, strong men,
wept like children. Then the head of the French column emerged,
and in an hour ten thousand men were on the march for Margate.

THINGS ONE WOULD RATHER HAVE LEFT UNSAID.
A TRIBUNAL OF FASHION.
Colonel ToTTENHAM, speaking at a meeting the other day
said, “Why should Fashions come from France 2'' and propose
that a Court should be formed of English Ladies, who would set
the Fashions.]
OH, why should the mode of to-day come from France,
When England can set all the Fashions herself?
Now courage, fair Ladies, your banners advance,
And win for the trader both honour and pelf.
There's kudos to gain, though Le Follet may sneer
Though Frenchmen may fume, and though milliners
stare;
Still through every season and change of the year
The Ladies of England shall choose what they'll wear.
Home fabrics, no doubt, will once more be the rage,
Like those Lady BECTIVE has urged us to buy;
Bring back the old guise of historical page,
And heed not the follies that Frenchwomen try.
You surely should know what becomes you the best,
As well as the Gaul, and, whate'er may betide,
Choose textures yourselves, and the shape, for the rest,
When doubtful, perchance you’ll ask man to decide.
Then form a tribunal whence Fashion's decrees
You issue with firm and unanimous voice,
Wear not what you’re told, but dress just as you please,
You'll find we shall like and acclaim every choice.
The woman of England a mission will find
That suits her far better than trying for votes,
In choosing the Fashion that's most to her mind—
Oh! would her reforms but extend to dress-coats |
The Clubs and the Stage.
WE read the following in the Daily Telegraph,
Feb. 16:—
“The honour of selecting a member of the Athenaeum Club
H. yesterday conferred by the committee on Mr. HENRY
RVING.'
This is quite a novel idea. We shall probably hear
next that Mr. DAVID JAMEs has the honour of selecting
members for Boodle's, Mr. HARE for the St. James’s,
Mr. BANCROFT for the Carlton, Mr. Coghlan for the

ADAPTED FROM THE FRENCH,
(With Compliments to M. Zola.)
(Letter from Solicitor to Author.)
SIR, Pump-sucker Court, Lincoln's Inn.
We are directed by our client, Mr. JoBAM Jon Es, to inform
ou that it is our opinion that an action for libel will lie against you
or the unwarrantable liberty you have taken with his name in your
novel, Washed Out by Tears, now appearing in Tidman's Magazine.
In the novel in question, you make Joram Jones murder his uncle
by marriage—a Duke—in the first chapter, and elope with his
grandmother—a Marchioness—in the second. From this, the only
published instalment of your story, it would seem that you intend
to make our client's namesake a grossly immoral personage. . As
such a reputation will do serious injury to our client, who is a
..I. tradesman in the Borough, in his business of a grocer
and cheesemonger, we must insist, upon reparation immediately, or
ask for the name of your º adviser.
We are Sir, your obedient servants, RITS AND KosTs.
(Letter from Author to Solicitor.)
DEAR SIRs, - Butterfly Gardens.
I will be frank with you. I certainly did intend in my
novel, Washed Out by Tears, to make Joram Jones a villain. In
the course of the º he was to have upset a railway train, burned
down a hospital, and slaughtered an archbishop. However, now
that I discover that I have wounded the just susceptibilities of your
client (of whom I had never heard before receiving your letter), I
will alter the whole scheme of my plot. I will account for the
crimes of the initial chapters by working out the idea of mistaken
identity. I think your client will like his namesake now, if he is
good enough to buy Tidman's, and reads my story, have made
Joram the most amiable of men. He is to found a Cathedral, lead a
forlorn hope (for which he will receive the V.C.), and marry the
heroine! Surely this ought to satisfy your client P
Yours sincerely, SHAKESPEARE SNooks.
Letter from Solicitor to Author.
Iče Jones v. Yourself.
DEAR SIR, Pump-sucker Court, Lincoln's Inn.
OUR client is much pleased with your letter, but desires to
say he would rather his namesake, Mr. Joram Jones, did not marry
the heroine, as he (our client) has a wife already. You have met our
first letter in such a very proper spirit that we feel sure that you
will attend to this request also, and thus render further proceedings
unnecessary. Enclosing our account against you in this matter
(including the charge for this letter), we remain, dear Sir,
Yours very faithfully, RITs AND Kosts.
P.S.—Our client has i. called, and says he would be much
obliged if you could kindly make some allusion to his business in the
Borough. But this we leave entirely to your discretion. Please
make draft payable “to bearer.”
Telegram from Author to Solicitor.
ALL right. Joram Jones shall not, marry heroine, but make his
fortune out of tea and cheese on the Surrey side of the water,
Cheque to you posted.

- Pleasant company for aughty ARcourt! He'll have to be carefuller of his lang-

have wentured on preveus occashuns to give the
and old Copperation a word or
as I haven't stood behind the chairs and heard the
Pollyticians and Judges and Statesmen and Common
Sounselmen ºf the day, without having heard a thing or two that I can put together for the
benefit of “that ancient and distinguished body,” as the QUEEN werry propperly calls 'em,
if they’re not too proud to lissen.
My first adwice would be, don't yield ainch, it’s a sine of weakness.
You've plenty of friends to bac
you, because they’re all in the same boat, so to speak,
that is to say just a little old-fashioned perhaps, and just a little slow, in these hurrying
telegraphic times, but if they are a going
to abollish everythink asis old and respect-
able merely because it is old and respectable,
it will be a rum sort of world when these
Gents as is neither old nor respectable has
quite done with it.
Take that grandest of all grand institu-
shuns the House of Lords. Won't they
stand by you to the bitter end? Is they a
likely body to go for to upset old institu-
shuns at H. call of that Scotch Gentleman
the Firth of Forth, though he is a M.P., or
rather as I should call him a M.T. as regards
branes? Certainly not, and why?—because
if once you begins abolishing everythink as
ain't of much use, I should like to know
where you’re a §: to stop.
Some low fellows laughs at Common
Councilmen because they wears blue dresses,
and when they drives through a crowd with
that aughty demeaner that so well becoms
their lofty station, the grinning Mob calls
'em Butchers, but if offishial costume is to
be sneered at, how about the personal ap-
pearance of the Royal Commissioners as
they sits in the sacred House of Lords with
their crimson robes on and their ermine
tippets, and their Cocked Hats, a parsing
the Bills as the QUEEN sends 'em to parse.
Is not that somethink to deepen the affec-
tionet regard evry true-born Britton has for
his country, speshally when the Gent as the
QUEEN sends to 'em, won't speak a single
word excep in the French langwidge, and,
as I am told, not werry good French nee-
ther? Then there’s some other old Insti-
tushuns as I knows on perfeshonally, siti-
vate in the Temple and thereabouts º:
it once said a long time ago as the Temple
was a good deal like a den of thieves?), and
don't they know what a good dinner is, and
don't they eat plenty on 'em too, at sum-
body else's expense? Why at some times
of the year the whole place smells of din-
ner, and a lovely smell it is to a poor
hungry Barister as never gets no briefs
excep, through some Public Office, such as
the Post Office for instance, and then only
in return for his wotes in the House of
Commons.
Ah! some Gents has nice idears of inde-
pendence and patriotism as will sell their
wotes and sell their constituents and sell
their werry soles, and all for a few beg-
garly guinees for Goverment briefs.
What a º world these reforming
Quacks and Quakers will make of it by the
time they have quite finished with it!
There's to be no old Institooshuns, ev'ry-
think’s to be what some truly great man
once called “beastly new.” There's to be
no colour in anything, excep I spose drab,
no fun, no humour, no feasting, excep in
Inns of Court, no fori Mayor's Show, no
Guildhall banquet!
What a lively idea!
Just another Pint. Who takes care of
the pore Widders and Orfans like the Cor-
poration and the City Company's Who
spends somuch on Eddycashun as they does?
I knows of one Company as gives away no
less than £10,000 a year in Charity And
these reforming Patriots(I’m told Dr. John-
son described 'em once) would take it all
away and spenditin rates. That's attewly
Christian idear that is Save the Rates
and starve the Poor .
An lor' when I was waitin' on the Ladies
and Gents at the Mansion Quse Ball last
Thursday, and seed the trooly ammirable
way as evrythink was done, . with the
LoRD MARE and LADY MAREss in all their
glory, I says is this ere, to wanish and to
melt into a “hairy nothink,” as the Pote
says? Never says I wile my name is

Extracted FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
LORD SALISBURY APPEALING ON BEHALF OF BRITISH WOOLLEN INDUSTRIES TO THE MYSTERIOUS AND OCCULT
TRIBUNAL OF FASHION.
MoMDAY Night, February 13. – House playing at debating
again. Fact is, that till the New Rules are reached there is nothing
to be done. But since the SPEAKER takes the Chair, the Mace is
brought out, and to all outward appearance Parliament is sitting,
we must look as life-like as possible. Accordingly, trot out Irish
question again, and battle around it with #. efforts to seem in
earnest. All old speeches made during Recess raked up. Oppo-
sition say to Ministers, “You said so-and-so somewhere in the
Recess. You bad, wicked men l How dare you?” Ministers retort,
“You’re another It was so-and-so we said on that particular occa-
sion.” Then extracts are produced, and read with much emphasis.
This wiles away the time, and brings on midnight. Only thing
wanted is an audience. Members generously concede it’s the right
and proper thing to do; and it would be very nice indeed if their
neighbours would only help to make a something that should look
like a House. As for them, pressing engagements unfortunately
call them away. So hour after hour the House empty, or filled with
voir et praeterea nihil.
Between the early hours of the sitting, when PLUNKET and
CHAMBERLAIN had a little set-to, and close upon midnight, when
Lord GEORGE HAMILTON said a few words, a dreary interval, during
º, he melancholy MARUM mused, and the bumptious BARRY
aWIeol.
GEORGIE HAMILTON really in fine form. Has been ºliº his
wrath for some weeks, and explosion when it came terrific. Nothing
less than Joseph CHAMBERLAIN's head on a charger would satisfy
him. In the meantime he will be slightly mollified if Mr. GLAD-
sTone will forthwith rise from the Treasury Bench and dismiss
Joseph from office. Mr. GLADSTONE, who has fixed himself in as
comfortable an attitude as the Treasury Bench permits, is apparently
asleep. Slightly moves at this injunction. Is he about to rise and
purchase his own safety by throwing over the President of the Board
of Trade P. J. C. bends his head, ostensibly to rearrange the flower
in his buttonhole, but really to hide the pallor that steals over his
face. The few Members present hold their breath in anticipation
of the coming crisis. PETER begins to consider how the Board of
Trade would suit him. GEORGIE pauses a moment in the torrent of
his speech. He is a fair-minded young nobleman, and will give
GLADSTONE every chance. But W. E.G. is only settling himself
into a more comfortable position. The opportunity has fled. CHAM-
BERLAIN is saved; but, as Lord, GEORGE mutters to himself, as he
resumes his seat, “At what a price—at what a price l.”
Business done.—Consideration of Rules further postponed.
Tuesday *. Members not so bad after all. Been
desperately dull this Session. Began to think there was no more
humour amongst them. But, as Mr. BRIggs says,
“You may break, you may shatter the vase if you will,
The scent of the roses will cling to it still.”
To-night commenced with the old, old game, and the same sad story.
Address on the Debate, with tremendous harangue from SEXToN.
Spoke for two mortal hours and a half, and not nearly so well as in
some of his quarter-of-an-hour flashes. Eight o'clock when he sat
down. House empty as usual. SExton talked the Saxon clean off
the premises. Members gone away believing the division would
take place about one in the morning.
“What a lark,” says RICHARD Power, kept in from his own
dinner “to rush the division now.”
Word passed round to stow all speeches; great trouble with The
MACFARLANE, who had his ready, and isn’t going to see it lost,
especially after coming down so early the day Parliament opened.
Made desperate attempts to rise; friends and countrymen held on to
his coat-tails; but The MACFARLANE is of powerful build, and no
one can say what might have happened if Joseph GILLIs, temporarily
releasing the pressure of his knuckles from the back of his neck, had
not whispered in his ear that he could deliver his Speech on the
report of the Address. The MACFARLANE then subsided. Question
3. Aldren agreed to, and House comfortably Counted Out by nine
o'clock.
Joseph GILLIs subsequently spent two happy hours in Palace
Yard, watching Members arrive ready to vote in the expected
division. They came down smiling and radiant with the thought
that they'd missed the boredom of #. evening, and would still have
their names in the Division List for the contemplation of distant
constituencies. Amtold that when J. G. put his head inside cab or
carriage, and soothingly said, “Aren’t yealittle late P” bad language
ensued. As was said by one of old time, “Joey B. is dev'lish sly.”
Business done.—Address agreed to.
Wednesday Afternoon.—This Irish Debate reminds me of a dis-
tant family connection named Snarleyow. Captain MARRYAT made
a novel about him, showing how, after he had been at various times
shot, drowned, poisoned, boiled, and finally buried under eight feet
of earth, always turned up again, Yºshi. his tail as if nothing
particular had happened. Thought we had done with the Address
after the collapse of last night; but here it is as brisk as ever, or
rather as deadly dull. The MACFARLANE worked off his speech, and
then the ATToRNEY-GENERAL turned on his tap, which was only
turned off when a Quarter-to-Six struck.
Business done.—Consideration of Rules further postponed.
Thursday Night.—ATToRNEY-GENERAL for IRELAND turned on his
tap again. When it had been running for an hour began to think
he had forgotten he had already done half-an-hour on Wednesday
night. When be reached the second hour felt sure of it; when he
commenced on the fifth, half-hour, asked STAFFORD, NoFTHQork to
lead me out, which he did most gently, Says, if this sort of thing
goes on, dog-tax ought to be repealed. Most kind-hearted man,
STAFFORD ; always tries to say pleasant things.

A DAY'S PLEASURE.
THERE is a useful index of “What's going on ” given every
morning in the Daily News, which, taken with yesterday's “To-
morrow” of the Globe, is invaluable to the Visitor to London, who
wants to see everything, and also to the Resident “of no occupation.”
If the Visitor to Town gets his Daily News at 7:30, and immediately
commences its study, he may arrange a day for himself full of
varied amusements. Nothing commences before 10: therefore he has,
supposing he rises at 8, a good hour and a half before he need start.
Take, for instance, iast Thursday. At ten he would have been
the first to enter the Sportsman's Exhibition at the Agricultural
Hall, Islington. Having thoroughly exhausted this by 12, he
would be ready for his luncheon, to which he could devote an hour,
and at 1 P.M. he might have gone down to the office of the Local
Government Board, and joined the deputation about the Assessed
Rates—a most interesting subject—to that body at 2 P.M.
Having had enough of this in about ten, minutes, a fast hansom
(supposing such a phenomenon at hand) would have deposited him at
the §. Theatre in time for the new piece at 2:30.
Having formed a fº idea º sufficient for conversational
Fº of what the play was like, he could have driven off to the
oyal Institution, where, at 3, there was a lecture on the “Geo-
ſº Distribution of Animals,” from which he might have torn
imself away in order to be at the St. James's Hall by 3:45, so as to
miss as little as possible of the lecture on Opium Smoking.
A glance at his Daily News list, which, of course, he would be
º in his waistcoat-pocket, and a rapid reference to his watch,
would, if the latter were correct, inform him that the House of
Commons opened at 4, and he, must be there early in order to
get a good *. under the Gallery. By remaining in the House
till 4'45, and then running up to the House of Lords, he could see a
little bit of the fun there, and then rush off to the Hellenic Studies
Society, whose meeting was held at 5 P.M. in Albemarle Street. He
could, however, be there at 5'10, and by that time the eminent
Grecians wouldn’t have got much beyond a preliminary discussion
on the authorship of Homer.
The Dinner of the *...* put down in the Daily News list for
the Fishmongers' Hall, but as no hour was mentioned, our Visitor
would have been rather puzzled; still, take it that at 5:30 he left
the Hellenic Studies, returned to his lodgings, kept his cab at the
door and dressed in five minutes, he might easily have arrived at the
Fishmongers' Hall by a few minutes after six, when he would have
been just in time for the fish and joint, after which, without inter-
rupting the harmony of the proceedings by taking leave of the
Chairman, he could have rushed off to the London Institution,
arriving about 7'10, in time to hear a portion of Professor ARM-
STRong's Lecture on the “Economical use of Coal-gas; ” and after a
quarter of an hour of this, he could have been at the opening of
Toole's Theatre at 7:30, and by 8-15 could have reached the rooms
of the Linnean Society during the first part of a discourse on the
“Potato Disease.” -
Unfortunately, he would have had to give up all idea of hearing
the discussion on “Water Fittings” at the Civi Engineers' Society,
of seeing the “Photographic Apparatus Exhibition” at the Society
of Arts, and could not have assisted at the Monthly Meeting of the
Historical Society, the Trio Concerts at Marlborough Rooms, the
Mozart concert at Victoria Coffee Hall, and a few other entertain-
ments which all commenced at 8. But he could have heard an Act
of the Lily of Killarney at Her Majesty’s, have got in for the best
part of Aladdin at the Gaiety, and taken a short but necessary
supper at any place where refreshment is served up to midnight,
with half-an-hour to spare for a soothing cigar and a consolatory grog.
Then he could have retired to rest before 1 A.M., and would have
risen next morning eager to read his next day's round of amuse-
ments in the Daily News Lists, and to act upon its advice in the
manner already suggested. Isn't Life in London worth Living *

WELL, WILLIAM, it may prove an excellent sauce,
A pleasant and wholesome political stirabout,
Although rival Cooks, as a matter of course.
. Its fashion and flavour will raise some demur about.
Yet one cannot help wishing—'tis your wish as well—
At St. Stephen's our plats might be au naturel.
Yes, ’tis probably true that the season has come

Since noise puts its Cl6ture on sense, and strikes dumb
The tongues that our toughest of problems could tackle,
And for such as will witlessly wantonly wag,
The only sure discipline may be the gag.
Oh, geese of St. Stephen's, vain, vicious verbose !
Öhe grudges the sacrifice made to your gabble;
Whilst sense bows to the yoke ’tis constrained to impose
On the necks of the noisy and rabid-tongued rabble.

For this precious result of your pestilent chorus.
Alas! for those fair fruits of Freedom's long toil,
That the spite of a goose-flock seems able to spoil .
Here’s wishing sure skill and success to the hand
That is set to the pitiful perilous puzzle
Of silencing folly's cacophonous band,
Without fitting Wisdom and Wit with a muzzle.

COCKNEY LEGISLATION.
A, FEw weeks ago, a lamentable accident occurred in Vienna. . It
º: have occurred in a chapel, but, as it happened, it occurred in
a theatre. It came at a dull time, and was a treasure to the news-
papers. They nursed it affectionately. Parliament has opened, and
uestions are being asked, as a matter of course, in the House of
ommons. These questions and the answers assume that if the Me-
º Board of Works do something, the claims on Government
will be satisfied. Newspaper commentators assume this likewise.
The Metropolitan Board of Works is a ſº body having
certain powers within a great portion of London. Assuming, in the
true, spirit of Cockney legislation, that London is the whole of
England, and that theatres are the only places in which the public
may be roasted alive, it seems hard that a i. tea-garden settle-
ment like Sydenham, and other similar places, are left without
rotection. At the Crystal Palace, thirty thousand º: can and
o sit down at a single performance of a Christmas Pantomime,
without the fostering care of Officialism or Bumbledom.
The LORD CHAMBERLAIN's ...; stops at Eaton Place in one
direction, and never reaches music-halls anywhere, and the authority
of the Metropolitan Board of Works, though it extends to music-
halls, is not in operation in the outskirts of London. Whether a
Scotchman is roasted or not in a theatre or a music-hall in Glasgow,
an Irishman in Dublin, a Yorkshireman in Sheffield, and a Lancashire
lad in Manchester, may not matter to our Cockney legislators, but
the least they can do is to make Londoners safe, in spite of parochial
limits and defective Acts of Parliament.
GooD IDEAl-In these days of strict economy of time and space,
when eyen, “Telegraphic Dispatch” is abbreviated to “Telegram’
or “Wire,” surely the heading “Meteorological Report” is too
lengthy a title for a daily column in a newspaper. y not call
it “The Forecast-le?”

LAYS OF A LAZY MINSTREL.
MY BEDROOM FIRE.
OH list while I strike a lan

And sing the joys of my Be
oom Fire |
The wind may howl and the rain may patter
And beat in anger against the pane;
The storm may bluster—it don’t much matter:
I care not twopence" for wind or rain:
The red coals burn and the billets splinter;
The fitful flash and the glowing gleams
Efface the ills and the chills of Winter,
And bear me off to the Isle of Dreams |
A few dry logs, with much care selected,
A scuttle of coals and a vesta light,
A bundlet of rhymes by Punch rejected,
Will work a charm on a Winter's night!
I watch the light on my bed-room ceiling,
The chequered shadows that come and go ; I
While a sense of sleep comes o'er me stealing,
I note the flicker .# gloom and glow:
The tiny gas-jets in paean choral,
The praises sing of the drowsy god;
I feel as though I had taken §§
And drift away to the Land of Nod |
The rain may fall, and the windows clatter,
The winds without may their revels keep,
I close my eyes, and I say “What matter?” $
And almost fancy I’m off to sleep.
* Why “twopence?”—Ep.

ALPHONSE AT THE SPORTMAN EXHIBITION.
YoU were right, my dear Redacteur-en-chef, to send me—I who
speak—to the Agricultur-al to see Exposition Feld-Sport. “For
am I not perfect gentleman-ridere f * Ah yes, but I am! But
en avant-behold my report.
I arrive at Is-lin-ton. I enter. I say to myself “ALPHoNSE, m
fellow, you shall see how these English shoot the fox, how they cate
the birds, how they defy the dreadful cricket!” I say this, and the
first things I observe are some toys | Here is a rocking-horse, there
an effigy of the venerable “ Tante Salli '" But I say to myself,
“My fellow, these are for the hours of recreation When the
gentleman-ridere is tired of blowing his horn, and has blunted his
couteau de chasse on the throats of the wily rabbit, he throws sticks
at the tobacco-pipes | But yet, it is reasonable !” And I walk on
and come to a stand full of games. The first thing I notice in this
stand is a cloth for trente-et-quarante. “My faith !” I again say,
... But this, is curious ! ... And yet the sportman, when he cannot
find the wild pig, must have other excitement! I see! He plays
with his keepere at rouge-et-noir as he would play at Monte Carloſ
Ah, the good hour !” Then I observe a large building, and I ask,
“My fellow, what is that lºgº building P” The fellow I address
answers, “Can you not see? It is put up by the Iron Church
Makers.” . But this is delightful! The perfect gentleman-ridere is
not only brave and spiritual—he is also religious. He takes, his
Chapel with him! He sets up his church in the forest like a modern
Sir HUBERT! Ah, but these English—how they love Sunday !
I take off my hat to the sportman's chapel, and I come to a
photographic album. “What is, this?” I say, “What has photo-
graphy to do with the sporting P” Then, I think I am stupid. Of
courseſ I see it all! . The perfect gentleman-ridere, when he meets
the lion, takes his carte before he shoots him 1 Ah! but this is the
phlegm Anglais—it is truly Britannique !
I pass on. I come to some visiting cards! But this is droll!
Then I say to myself, “My fellow, the English are a civilised race.
Two strangers shoot the same bird, they both claim it. They quarrel.
Then they take out their card-cases, and deliver them to their
keeperes. A meeting is arranged They fight ! One is killed !
The other attends his foe's funeral in the iron church Ah, but it
is magnificent, but to Frenchmen—not the sport!”
Again. I progress. I come toastall full of comic pictures ] I pass
on, and here are some china vases!, “What have these,” I say, “to
do with the perfect gentleman ridère f* I consider. He can put
neither the comic pictures, nor the china vases, in his iron church—
they would be out of place! But why not decorate the trees of his
forest, to remind him of what he calls, “’Ome—sweet 'ome f"
Why not indeed P. But the English are domesticated |
I still walk | And then I smile ! But the perfect gentleman-
ridere is gallant ' He is brave, and loves the Ladies' Certainly;
or why do I find these “fans at eighteen-pence?”. But hold—they
are presents for his wife . He is unsuccessful. He kills not the
fox, he can find no wild pig! And Madame is naturally annoyed 1
“My fellow,” she cries, “why have you not brought back our
dinner P”. He says nothing, but gives }. a fan at eighteen-pence.
She is satisfied She is even gay ! All is forgotten and forgiven I
And see, here is a travelling Telegraph-Office, so that Monsieur
may send a record of his triumphs to Madame. Again, happy idea!
Then I enter a dark room, and am shown a life-buoy which shines
in the blackness. “My fellow,” I say, “what is the use of this?”
It is good, I am told, at night. It may be thrown to a drowning
man if he falls off into the sea from a yacht ! I will avoid the boat-
sportſ I do not wish to fall into the sea from a yacht!
But I am not quite satisfied. I speak to an Official. “My brave
boy,” I say, “where is the perfect gentleman-ridºre's pººdlºdogſ. * *
The official gives me a Catalogue, and º “One Shilling.” I
pay the silver, and examine the book. But this is a disappoint-
ment! The Exposition has no poodle-doggs.' Then, how can the
perfect gentleman-ridere kill his prey This is an omissionſ
I see some guns, some billiard-tables, some baths! Baths! The
droll idea . It is curious how these English love their “tubbes '''
But hold—here is something quite French It makes me i. It
carries me back to Paris, to the Boulevards, to the Bois de Boulogne !
But ah! it is too charming ! I see before me.“an ever-clean collar,
that will wear for weeks without washing !” It is worthy of the
Grand Nation / It is unique !
But what makes me turn pale? What makes me tremble? What
makes me go away? What makes me say to myself, “My fellow
you must cease to be a perfect gentleman-ridere!”? I will teli
you! It is a carriage! I ask, “What is it?” The man I address
replies, “An ambulance to carry home the wounded !” This is too
much ſº I decide I will not shoot the fox d l’Anglaise ... It is too
dangerous ! No ; I prefer the sport d la Française. ..It is more
amusing to stop in a café all day long, and for distraction to play
the horn 1—Share with me, then, dear Redacteur-en-chef, my
highest consideration. (Signed) ALPHONSE.
AMONG THE SAVAGES.
THE Graphic of last week commemorates, pictorially the enter-
tainment given by the Savage Club to H.R.H.. the Prince of WALES
and of Good +. After the dinner at Willis's Rooms, the
party adjourned to their Wigwam (near the Savely Theatre), where
“music had charms to soothe the savage breast.” Is our OscAR a
member 2 We suppose not, as they only admit civilised savages—
not one who is still Wilde. But where among the Sons of the War-
aint and Feathers who entertained the Great White Chief of the
}. Faces, was “the Bard”—(you should “give it to the Bard”
for his absence, Mr. J. L. ToolE)—to sing the Song of Hiawatha,
or Firewatha, or Wiskianwatha, about the noble Aitch-Ar-Aitcha”
Of all pals he learned the language, .
Learned their names and learned their secrets,
How the Akturs had their dodges,
How the Pressmen wrote their copy,
How the Punster punn’d so glibly,
How the Singer ... sweetly ;
Talked with them whene'er he met them,
Called them “Aitch-Ar-Aitcha's Brothers.'
Then the Chairman, Kunlif-o-wen,
Made a speech to Aitch-Ar-Aitcha
At the Rooms of Willis, when they
Made a banquet in his honour.
All the members came and feasted,
All the guests praised Aitch-Ar-Aitcha,
Called him Good-Chap, Puffa-Bacca,
Called him Kind-Heart, Tayk-it-Easee.
Gushr ABATEMENT NUIsANCE ExHIBITION.—We shall welcome
this. Mechanical appliances for gagging Gushers of all sorts. Gush-

“I so enjoyed myself at a Candelabra Dance the other night,” said
Mrs. RAMsioth A.M. “A what dance º' we asked. “A Candelabra,”
she replied; “a dance, you know, where everybody is expected to
go out at twelve o'clock.”
THE FURNEAux FRAUDs.-The name of this Adventuress has been
variously spelt. Once it was “FEARNEAUx,” suggestive of No Fear.
In FURNEAUx the idea is Dantesque.

THE SIMPLE AUCTIONEER. GOING ! GOING !! GONE!!!
JAM, an idler about Town, with no domestic cares or anxieties,
with plenty of money for my moderate wants, and with a consider-
able amºunt of popularity among my particular set, which I am
repeatedly assured does not arise from a kind of reputation I have
acquired for giving recherché little dinners for six or eight.
My troubles, such as they are, arise from my possession of three
g ualities. I have a great thirst for º, ge, a great rever-
ence for truth, and a great respect for my fellow men; but there are
so many things going on around me in this wonderful London of
ours I cannot at all understand, that I get fairly puzzled.
The same amazing amount of ignorance that I have deplored and
marvelled at in Surveyors, I find to exist in an almost equal degree
in Auctioneers.
Having plenty of leisure time and a great love of Works of Art, I
9ften visit auction rooms, and there have to listen to a display'of
ignorance that positively astounds me.
For instance, I often see some wretched daub of a picture put up
fºr sale that would be dear at £5, and I am tº: by the Auc-
tioneer that it is a genuine TURNER, or a Roberts, or a %:.. as
the case, may bel-but that in consequence of the great depression in

that not the faintest shadow or shade of suspicion of the genuineness

of the picture has ever crossed his experienced mind, and yet when,
after an amount of entreaty difficult to understand, but of course
highly creditable to his keen sense of honour and his reverence for
truth, he knocks down the miserable imposture for some £10 or £12,
he seems quite satisfied with the result, and proceeds with the next
lot with renewed vigour ! Now, what can all this mean?
Of course no one for a moment could doubt the truthfulness and
honesty of these gentlemen; it must, therefore, be simply ignorance.
I would venture therefore very humbly to suggest that, before being
allowed to sell works of Art, Auctioneers should be compelled to pass
an examination sufficiently stringent to prevent their fºliº into
such lamentable errors of judgment, and making such fearful mis-
takes as to the genuineness or value of the works they have to
describe, as well as dispose of.
I remember, some years ago, when my ignorance on these matters
was as great as that of an average Auctioneer, I was persuaded by
one of these gentlemen to *:::::: a very large picture, which I was
assured was an undoubted GAINSBoRough. Ah! what I endured
from the remarks of my kind and candid friends when my huge
treasure was first *...* the wall of my drawing-room, I never
shall forget. Had it been a Cartoon by TENNIEL, or a social sketch
by DU Yºr. it could not have excited more general or more
hearty laughter. I bore it well for some time, but at length yielded
to the earnest entreaties of my friends, and got rid of the #.
swindle; and I don't mind confessing that an occasional gleam, of
suspicion has sometimes crossed my mind that that, particular
Auctioneer, on that ºl. occasion, was not so entirely ignorant
as the generality of his class must apparently be.

(From Secretary Arnaud's Private Notes.)
Marseilles.—Troun de l'air /—to go in for local colouring in the
matter of expletives—how he did enjoy that first bouillabaisse on his
native Cannebière ' I thought we should have had the gendarmes
at us for attempted suicide when he ordered the third, and also the
third bottle of that particularly piquant little Cahors wine of which
he is, so fond—and which makes me so ill. “Ah, garçon (" he
exclaimed, over, number three, “how flat, stale, and unprofitable
beside this are the truffles and champagne of office. Upon my word,
I don't care if I never go back, there again.” But it was slightly
contradictory in the great man to dictate seven letters of instruction
to his adherents, after dessert, telling them that they must demand
in the most friendly manner, the dissolution of the Chamber and
the execution of FREYCINET.
Nice.—“What freedom! what delightful comfort and calm l’” he
remarked, expansively, when he got out of the carriage and found
that nobody was there to meet him, and that when M. GAMBETTA's
luggage was mentioned to the Station-Master, that oblivious Qfficial
simply answered: “GAMBETTA –connais pas. This way, Milord
SMEETH; all your baggages in the carriage; thank you, Milord.”
Same serene Fºllº. in the Promenade des Anglais, where the
only people who saluted us were one of the waiters at the hotel and
the great Statesman's own father, who, with sublime paternal devo-
tion, actually consented to recognise his offspring in that public
place. “Isn't it delightful ?” the Boss remarked. “A year ago
there were about a hundred thousand simpletons yelling ‘J’ive
GAMBETTA l’ and the horses could not get on at all {..., of the
avalanche of flowers. Isn't this a jolly deal jollier, eh?” It is true
that he added, about ten minutes rwards, “By the bye, take
down the name of that Station-Master; and, let me see, Nice makes
a goºd deal of money out of violets, doesn't it? . Ah, then, i.
sketch me a : for taxing violets three francs a bunch—it’ll do
for my next Budget.”
Genoa.-They were firing guns when we steamed into port, and
you should have seen the great Chief's look of vexation. He
positively flushed with disappointment, and there was a kind of
nervous smile on his #. that meant overpowering chagrin—to the
devoted eyes of an adherent like myself. And, when the Captain
said it was only the bersaglieri practising, he was immensely relieved,
for he said so : “Thought the stupid people were actually saluting.”
When we went to the Opera in the evening, and WERDI came into
our box, he became quite peevish, saying: “Now, you know I’m
nobody; why do celebrities come and pay court, to me; it's
ridiculous.” I had to put WERDI's name down for the next Grand

AN ODD CHAPTER,

remnants and bargains, always to be got cheap, especially when the new
fashions are coming in. . . . . Lord SALISBURY appears able to promise an

THE two Noblemen stepped from their box into the foyer, There
had not been such a close night since the first of April. The Opera
was crowded, the thermometer stood at 96° under the portico, and
they were clad in the heavy fabrics now associated with perfect ton,
Their shirt fronts were thickly loaded with white clay, and a stout
ribbed coarse corduroy cloth of extra thickness. º the rest of
their evening costume. They had, moreover, made it a point of
honour to wear in addition, two complete sets of Sheffield grey twist
underclothing ; for they had just joined the New British Industrial
League, and were enthusiastically determined to be true to its
economic principles... Still, they were hot, and by a common instinct
they lounged in the direction of one of the well polished hydrants
and its row of neatly arranged fire-buckets, with the intention of
refreshing themselves.
But as they passed the entrance to the refreshment saloon they
#: The scene that met their gaze was curious... Within was a
ainting, struggling, perspiring, but highly aristocratic throng, who,
clamouring for water, appeared fairly to threaten to take the counter
by storm. Here an Earl, well known in society, was standing on a
small marble-topped table, and, whirling his opera-glasses round in
the air to attract attention, was offering five guineas for an ice-pail.
Beneath him, gasping on the floor, lay a distinguished Statesman
trying to tear off some of his woollen upper clothing in an evident
stage of incipient delirium. By one of the huge windows, a Political
Economist, hitherto favourably known for his careful and scientific
handling of fiscal problems, stood with his head thrust through a
pane of plate-glass, singing snatches of a comic song. On all sides
well-bred people were reeling and using strong language, while the
attendants standing, in self-defence, on the ... of shivered coffee
urns and sponge cakes, were distributing, as fast as they could,
amidst a shower of sovereigns, saucers of rough ice and salt to the
§. iºd surging mob by which they seemed likely to be over-
Wheimed.
They watched the strugglers for a few seconds, when the eye of
the least exhausted suddenly lighting on the familiar features of an
Eminent ºf; . to force a pathway out of the midst of the
fray with a tin of lemon-drops and half a cup of cold tea, he made a
dash to his assistance.
His companion was about to follow when a heavy thud on his
shoulder, accompanied by a silvery little laugh, made him look round
angrily for an explanation.
"Ha! It is you, Duchess!” he said, biting his lip in pain with a
well-bred smile, as he endeavoured to suppress his evident annoyance.
“How awkward of me,” was the pretty-pouted rejoinder. “I
merely meant to give you a playful tap, thinking I had my Palais
Royal Eventail avec moi; but you see, this is the new Birmingham
make, and it weighs five pounds and a half, so sorry. I am afraid
I must have hurt you.” She held up a clumsy, highly-coloured,
over-sized fan of British manufacture as she spoke. "C'est très
fatiguant,” she added, laughingly, trying at the same time to wield
the cumbersome article, “and only this afternoon I meant merely to
touch the dear old Duke ...}} with it sur le front; and I have
rendered him absolutely invisible for a whole week 1 Mais, que
woulez-vous 2 We must be patriotic.”
She tapped her companion again playfully on the fingers. He
winced. “N'importe,” he said, “N'importe,” at the same time
rubbing his *::::::: with a courteous polish, as he made a more
careful survey of his naïve interlocutor. A handsome woman of not
more than five-and-thirty, she was dressed with the most perfect
taste, as it was understoºd by the haute société of the hour. Her
jupon of Manchester print of a running colour, quilted with buchons
of inferior linsey, was relieved, here and there, by naºuds d l'occa-
sion of damaged British ribbons; while her bodice of housemaid's
calico, to which the salesman's recommendation of “Look here. All
this lot at 18.10%d.,” by an heureuse pensée of the modiste had been
left still attached, was trimmed with petites ruches, cleverly contrived
from second-hand remnants of faded alpaca.
For a moment her appearance almost dazzled him. The E.
Duchess saw her advantage, and again §. him an arch blow on
the fingers with her weighty eventail, laughed a coy little laugh.
But the strain proved this time too much for the quality of the in-
ferior étaffe in which her fair form was cased. A series of startlin
cracks, ringing along the foyer, reminded her that something j
given way.
“Ils lefont tous,” she said, nothing disconcerted, for she had be-
come familiar with the bargains of her native land, and knew their
ways. “Come, give me your arm, and take me to the box.” He
was hot; but his ancestors had fought at Agincourt, and he was a
Gentleman. He did not hesitate.
“In half a minute,” he said, chivalrously. In another second, he
had turned the corner, and was bounding, as fast as his heavy
woollen over-clothing would allow him, down the grand staircase
towards Bow Street. He heeded F.; in his flight. There was a
crowd in the hall below gathered round the now prostrate form of
the Eminent Personage he had noticed struggling but lately in the
salon above, and he heard a Policeman say kindly, “We’ll get you
to Hatfield presently, my Lord; but we must get some of this off
you first. The fabric has been too much for you.” . But he did not
wait, for, º and asphyxiated as he was, he had seen a vision of
loveliness descending the stairs that for a moment had nerved him.
The rich Manchester heiress, hanging on the arm of her father, the
noted woollen millionnaire, was drawing near. She was clad in a rich
Lyons velvet sacque, one of Worth's latest triumphs; and the
French polish on the boots of the Northern Croesus fairly corruscated
as he shambled along towards his carriage.
He saw his opportunity. He dashed forward, and with a
whispered plaisanterie in the ear of his goddess, offered to summon
the vehicle.
“Law, Pa,” said the . girl, “why, if it isn't the Earl tº
“The Hearl!” was the curt rejoinder, “why, a couple of Dooks
wouldn't be a match for you!” -
The next moment sixteen footmen in carmine plush and shoulder-
knots, had made a passage to the carriage.
Then the voice of the millionnaire was heard once more outside.
“Now then, Coachman, 'Ackney Wick Palace—'Ome !” And the
splendid equipage drove off.
“I’m afraid I’ve made a mistake,” said the Eminent Personage,
still on the floor, but at length opening his eyes feebly.
“Never mind, my Lord,” replied the Policeman kindly. “The
best of us can't sometimes help a bit of wool-gathering.”

THE DISTRICT SURVEYOR.
MR. PUNCH has received a communication from a second District Surveyor,
who remonstrates against the supposed charge of over-anxiety in the performance
of his important duties, resulting in the receipt of fees apparently in excess
of what might be strictly requisite. - -- - -
Mr. Punch, with that desire for strictimpartiality for which he is so remark-
able, has referred the matter to the young man in his gigantic establishment
whose duty it is to survey mankind from Cheapside to the Zoo, who informs
him that he received his information from a Report of the Progeedings of the
Commissioners of Sewers of the City of London, from which he learnt that the
District Surveyors' Reports resulting from the fire alluded to, occasioned sº
much surprise that they were referred to a Committee for examination and
report. - - - -
The Report has not yet been received, and is awaited, he is informed,
with ..º. curiosity by various persons more or less interested in these
:a When it is presented, Mr. Punch will return to the subject, if
requested. -
n the meantime he is quite willing to acknowledge, and does so very readily,
that over-anxiety is a much more pardonable offence than gross neglect, and is
attended with far less serious results; and if a fee of a few shillingºgan by any
possibility assist in the slightest degree in preserving Mr. Punch's valuable
person from the unpleasant consequences of an unreported and, therefore
*:::::: dangerous structure, he thinks that, upon the whole, he will be
inclined to condone the comparatively slight offence of un peu trop de zéle.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted From
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
House ºf Commons, Monday Night, Feb. 20.-Sir HENRY TYLER,
who is always thinking of º: the greatest welfare of the
greatest number of shareholders, tells me he had a brilliant idea
to-night whilst Mr. MARRIOTT was speaking. . Why not connect
the House by telephone with all the constituencies—at least, in the
Home Counties, and turn on the switch according as one, or other
Member was speaking HARcotRT put his veto on the thing
immediately. “Not while I’m HoME SECRETARY, if you please,
Toby. I know my responsibilities and my resources, and I know
that if the constituencies had to suffer any º portion of
what we endure in the House, there'd be a revolution.”
TYLER taken aback by this strong view, but not given up idea
et. Wants me to be a Director of the new company. in
've enough to do to look after the business of the nation. Pit
MARRIOTT isn't Member for some place nearer than Brighton. If
he were Member for Croydon, for example, wouldn't need telephone.
People could hear him there quite well, without mechanical aid.
Has a brassy sort of voice, which he uplifts with great determina-
tion. Most useful in case of an elderly jury a trifle deaf, but a little
annoying in the House. -
In other respects entertainment reminiscent of a criminal lawyer
...; Old Bailey Jury, for whom a wag of the forefinger means
much, and who wouldn't give a button for a counsel who couldn't
raise his voice above a whisper. House, on the whole, didn't appre-
ciate Mr. MARRIoTT's gifts; but the possession of a liberal mind
enabled him to make up for the deficiency ºrºnal efforts.
Business done.—First Resolution introduced.
Tuesday Night.—Just come in from voting in a division on
“CHARLEs BRADLAUGH, Esq., who—” All very merry, having
got through the difficulty at a comparatively early hour.
“No doubt about Who’s Who in 1882,” says Mr. AGNEw, and we
all laugh again.
BRADLAUGH’s been defeated in his latest move; and now, fo
goodness sake, let us get about the business of the nation, e’
just wait to hear figures read from the Chair, and then go off to
dinner. “Noes 307, Ayes 18,” says the SPEAKER in his sonorous
voice. Echo, scarcely died, away when “CHARLES BRADEAUGH,
Esq., Who,” is observed walking up the floor of the House, othing
particular in that, you know. Turn, as a matter of habits towards
chair of Sergeant-at-Arms. The gallant Captain in due
course appear, dance a minuet with the Member for Nor pton,
and the show will be over. -
“Doocid bore,” Mr. SYREs languidly whispers, in the ear of Mr.
MonTAGUE GUEST; “always same thing over again, doncha.” But
what’s this? CHARLEs BRADLAUGH, Esq., Who, has overhauled
the wollum, and, holding it in his right hand as if he were
taking aim with intent presently to shy it at the SPEAKER, is
offering a few remarks.

C. B. to withdraw, did it again. C. B., never so happy as when sub-
mitting to authority, at once rose from the mangled remains of the
Hon. Member on whom he had been sitting (just as if he had been a
Committee), and took up his old seat below the Bar. But RANDoIPH
would have no more of this. Sir STAFFORD, feeling it hopeless
further to resist, moved, the expulsion of C. B., Esq., which was
done forthwith. “Done it at last !” said RANDoIPH.
“Yes,” said Sir STAFFoRD, mildly; “but indeed you’ve done it
from the first. You've played BRADLAUGH's game as if you were in
secret alliance with him; and I'm afraid that what we’ve done
this afternoon is precisely what he wanted us to do, and what he
carefully and adroitly led up to. You’re a clever young man,
RANDolph, but there's someone cleverer than you.”

for his moustache: * ...
“Precisely; ... Who.” And Sir STAFFORD went his way, chuckling
at his gentle wit. Business done.—Mr. BRADLAUGH’s. º
Thursday †. to feel that I’ve not done anything yet
to justify the high but well-grounded expectations of my consti-
tuents. Writing a Diary’s all very well; but Barkshire did not
elect me for that., Haven't yet even drawn up a notice of motion
or a question, read it in the House, and afterwards sent it privatel
to the news †. with a request for its insertion, like some one
know does habi y. Have rather held back, thinking there are
talkers enough in the House, and that giving notice of a question is
rather a cheap way of advertising one's self.
Mean to begin now, Will move for return of the answers
delivered by Sir CHARLEs DILKE since he joined the Government.
Also shall move that they be framed and glazed, and a copy pre-
sented to every other Minister to hang over his bed, so that he may
see it last thing at night, and consider it first thing in the morning.
Positively think DILKE’s improving. , Answers are short without
being curt; frank without being injudicious; and in respect to
literary style, marvels of concise expression. Now we are talking
of how to save time by improving procedure, Ministers might do
worse than help me to get my return and make good use of it after.
Never above studying from a model myself. Have to-night sat
at the feet of Earl PEncy, and begin to think I can manage it;
though, of course, at º interval. Fashion to talk of the heir of
the PERCIEs as if some slight deterioration in race had taken place
since Chevy Chace. That is the result of superficial observation.
Believe Earl PERCY would be a terrible fellow if once roused.
Knows his own disposition, and holds it in check. Note how, when
he has been talking for a quarter of an hour, and the House has been
gradually emptying, he grasps himself with both hands by the
collar of his coat. What would happen if he didn’t thus check
himself * one can say. --- --
Joey B. in fine form to-night. A Hippopotamus revelling in a
mud-bath, or an Ourangoutang let loose in an orange alley, could not
be lighter of heart or fuller of spirits. Joseph GILLIS advised Mr.
GLADSTONE to secure for his son HERBERT, the reversion of MAR-
wooD's place. Also he has accused Mr. FoESTER of spending his
time in a gambling-house when he is supposed to be looking after
the affairs of Ireland. J. G. acknowledges that he has had a pretty
good night, and as he walks home the peaceful stars look down on no
more contented mind, nor . fuller of the ease that comes of the
consciousness that an agreeable duty has been performed.

gratifying to find the Commons leaving their own House and flocking

And gave to the blacker a nice little tract:
The following gives a resumé exact
Of what may be found in this excellent tract —
Speak gently to the herring, and kindly to the calf
Be blithesome with the bunny, at barnacles don't laugh!
Give nuts unto the monkey, and buns unto the bear,
Ne'er hint at currant jelly if you chance to meet a hare!
Don't tantalise the tortoise, nor sacrifice the stoat,
Don't persecute the parrot, nor grumble at the goat;
But give the stranded jelly-fish a shove into the sea—
Be always kind to animals wherever you may bel
Belenient with lobsters, and ever kind to crabs,
And be not disrespectful to cuttie fish or dabs;
Chase not the cochin-china, chaff not the ox obese,
And babble not of feather-beds in company with geese!
He tender with the tadpole and let the limpit thrive,
Be merciful to mussels, don't skin your eels alive;
When talking to a turtle don't mention calipee—
Be always kind to animals wherever you may bel
Oh, make not game of sparrows, nor faces at the ram
And ne'er allude to mint sauce when calling on aiambi
Don't beard the thoughtful oyster, don't dare the cod to crimp,
And worry not the winkle, or scarity the shrimp. . .
Tread lightly on the turning worm, don't bruise the butterfly,
Don't ridic e the -neck, nor sneer at salmon-fry;
Qh, ne'er delight to make dogs fight, nor bantams disagree—
Be always kind to animals wherever you may be:
Be F. with black-beetles, be courteous to cats,
And be not harsh with haddocks, nor rigorous with rats;
Give welcome unto wopses, and comfort to the bee,
And be not hard upon the snail—let blue-bottles go free.
Be lively with the cricket, be merry with the grig,
And never quote from BACON in the presence of a pig!
Don’t contradict the moogow, nor argue with the gee—
Be always kind to animals wherever you may be
receive my contemptible amount of Dividends.
Well, Sir, passing, along Newgate Street, I heard, to
my great surprise, the spirit-stirring strains of martial
music ; and ºf through the railings that separate
the play ound of the Blue-Coat School (otherwise
Christ's Hospital) from the adjacent Street, I saw a
sight that stirred my very soul to rapture!
ancy, Sir, some 800 or 900 fine-looking fellows, from
the rosy-cheeked little chap of ten to the fine, manly,
strapping fellows of seventeen or eighteen, all 'going
through their drill like a regiment of young Life Guards,
and #. ºf off the ground to the music of their
own Band, with all their banners waving, and amid the
pride and circumstance of glorious War
Sir, the enthusiasm among the on-lookers was some-
thing glorious to see; and many of us marched off with
head erect, and keeping time to the stirring music of the
young musicians.
Well now, Sir, why do I write thus powerfully, and
am I justified in doing so? Listen, and judge.
I am actually informed, and on such authority as I
gan't, for one instant doubt, namely, on that of the
Guildhall Beadle, a most respectable member of his
maligned profession, that it is proposed by the Bill that
the HQME SECRETARY is now preparing, to remove this
magnificent School from the spot that it has adorned for
300 years, and take it to Wimbledon, or some such, out
of the way place, where the boys will be as much hidden
from public gaze, and consequent public admiration, as
if they were on Šalisbury Plain. And what, Sir, is the
contemptible excuse for this contemplated change P
Pure air, forsooth, and greater retirement 1 What
twaddle ! Look at them, Sir, and judge for yourself.
Read the medical testimony, and judge for yourself as
regards their health. And as to greater retirement, the
* fellows are all intended for a busy City life, they
ove the glorious City, they are accustomed to the
glorious City, they love the associations that linger
around the old School, and they reverence the names of
those illustrious men who once lived where they now

MAN AND BEAST.
[The Elephant Jumbo having been purchased by Mr. BARNUM (U.S.),
a scheme has been set on foot to defray the expenses of keeping this remark-
able animal on this side of the Atlantic. Funds are plentiful.-Précis from
Daily Papers.]
[Right down East (London) exists an institution called the London Cottage
Mission. Its object is to lighten (at the Mission House, 67, Salmon's Lane,
Limehouse, E.C.) the sufferings of the very poor, and, when funds º
dinner of Irish stew is given every Wednesday to the starving children of the
East End. Funds are not plentiful.—Précis, not from the Daily Papers.]
ISAY, Master, d'ye hear them say of what they’re going to do–
They’re going to sell the Elephant what lives up in the Zoo;
An animal what lives on buns and cakes and things that nice,
And for this animal they’ve #. a most tremendjous price.
They can sell their precious Elephant, but what I wants to know
Is whether you think I would fetch a dollar for a show P
For I heard the people telling as how they meant to down
Sufficient “ready” for to keep that Elephant in town.
They say there's piteous letters from children what is nobs,
A-wishing to plank down their coin in fivers, skivs, and bobs;
A-crying and a-weeping 'cos of that big brute beast,
And there isn't one of them knows what a child is here down East.
We can't get the buns and sugar, and the apples and the takes,
But we has to live as best we can, or leastways living “fakes ; ”
We can feel the gnawing hunger, and we never gets our fill,
Nor columns in the Telegraph when ToM or DICK falls ill.
There's no national subscription to keep us oyer here—
No! it strikes me they’re uncommon glad when “outward bound”
we steer.
But then we’re not all elephants, we're only rags and bone,
To be gathered by the dustnan, or be left unfed, alone;
To be cast upon the gutter, and to grovel in the slums;
To seldom haye a decent meal, and raven for the crumbs;
To take to lying and to theft, to blasphemy and curse,
Maybe to fill the prison cell, maybe to leave it worse:
No pretty children pray for us, no parents write with tears
In papers 'bout our destiny, our feelings, and our fears;
Andyet down East there's one good work—(God bless its aim, say I)—
Though this aim mayn't be too noble nor partickerlerly high—
It's to give a weekly mouthful to the little starving brats
What hasn't got the skewerfuls of meat what has the cats.
I think they're somewhat better than an elephant at ease;
I think § 're somewhat better for to keep this side the seas;
And I think if these subscribers would subscribe for Irish stew,
They 'd do a nobler work than keep this Jumbo at the Zoo,
Tho' they might subscribe to both, you see, and keep their Jumbo too.

apparently feeble

would naturally
be somewhat too
demonstrative just
to wake, her lover

her serpent song
her tragic manner is a good contrast to the terror of Calabazas. .
The bright lines of the piece fall in pleasant places, and the joke
about the “Venetian Blind” is a straight shot which brings down
the House. It’s not difficult for the worst marksman to hit a house
or a haystack at twelve paces, but to hit it so as to bring it down is
another thing, and this the “Venetian Blind” effects.
Miss IRENA WERONA is a pretty and merry Beatrix. Of the music
the Bird duet between Mlles. LEO and WERONA, in Act II., is very
taking, and the humour of the situa-
tion decidedly original. The Trio to
Cupid, in Act I., sung by Mlles. LEO,
WERONA, and Mons. DESMONT, is
charming: and, of course, Mr. W. J.
HILL's song of “The Onion” is given
as only himself can give it. In the
course of the run a Home-rule allu-
sion º be introduced, and a jºke
about the “Re-peal of the Onion” be
brought in without any extra charge.
The story is rather perplexing, but
there’s the art of it—like Mr.
Weller's love-letter. If you under-
stood it all on the first visit a second
would not be necessary; and this, as a
light begins to dawn upon you, may
lead to a third, while a person un-

the SULTAN, and that army shall
used to preserve order (under

company with Tunis, and by the
88 me means.
Added by Germany. — That
ARABI BEY, the Khedive, and all
the other Egyptians shall be free

require—to hang themselves!
Added by Turkey.—That Egypt
shall be entitled to receive at the
hands of the SULTAN any number
of Firmans at the rate of £5
Turkish the dozen.
Added by England.—That the
Egyptians shall enjoy the most
erfect liberty, compatible with
eaving everything in the hands
of Messrs. BRowN, Jon Es, and
RoBINSON, and their employés.
And lastly, added by the Cos-

The Committee of the Incorporated Law Society recommend that “the

We've oft been told that from the ancient times,
The Jury-box has guarded British rights,
A Jury tried the Briton for his crimes, .
And often was locked up till late o' nights:
But now it seems a lawyers' committee,
Condemns the British Jury without pity.
'Tis sad to think the twelve good men and true,
Who sat with puzzled faces in a pen,
Must go—to give the Juryman his due
He does his best to right his fellow men:
But still there can't be any harm in stating,
His verdicts are sometimes most aggravating.
No more Old Bailey barristers will plead,
And laud the British Jury to the skies,
When one stern Judge doth sit there is no need—
For voice persuasive or for kindling eyes:
For all the Bar knows well forensic fudge is
Quite thrown away upon sagacious Judges.

It is difficult to say which they are from the tone in which the
question of “Fires in Theatres” is discussed. Perhaps we shall not
be far wrong if we assume that they are murderers. They open and
maintain buildings with the full intention of roasting people to
death, and when they cannot roast them, they do their best to poison
them. The ancient Ogre was an innocent and harmless creature

Sunday (in Paris).--Attended the Socialist Meeting in the Elysée

sent me, by IGNATIEFF. Declared that Russia had always been
Socialistic, and that therefore our chief enemy was Rome. Let it be
#. clearly seen, that a bombardment of the Vatican at an early
ate was an essential part of our civilising programme, and was of
course cheered to the echo by the nice citizens assembled. Saw the

orders) that I hadn't meant anything at all. Pugilistic scene with

cigar-holder, I might distinctly say that I knew for certain that we
had five hundred thousand men ready to march against King HUM-
BERT at a moment's notice. Italy as a kingdom was a standin
insult to the Slav race. The Latin was the enemy—(awfully cheere
here; suspect for the reason that most of the audience were yet in
daily difficulties with the Latin Grammar). Finished by beautiful
eulogium of peace—furnished by GoRTschakoff. Saw that Paris
speech was officially rebuked in St. Petersburg, and received the
rand Cross of the Star of Plevna.

A GLEAM OF GOOD NEWS.
WHAT with Ireland, Egypt, the Russian º and most
other matters of intelligence, foreign and domestic, the journals
have for a long while afforded very little but the dreariest and
dullest reading. Out of all their various contents the following will
perhaps be generally felt to be about the most lively and hopeful
announcement that has appeared in any of them for many a day:—
“Attempts are to be made at Jersey to form oyster-beds round the coast of
the island, with the view of reviving a fishery that for many years has been
completely neglected.”
There is therefore, at any rate, a ray of hope that the rising
generation may ossibly some day derive a º of comparatively
cheap and plentiful oysters from successful endeavours made by the
islanders of Jersey to cultivate the Jersey natives. What is that to
us? Not much, indeed; but who can name any better in or out of
all the newspapers *—ºster song for the Jersey Minstrels, “ Tuck

THE FISHERIES EXHIBITION.
WE will hold an Exhibition to improve our catch of fishes,
We’ll show nets and boats and every sort of newest fishing gear,
That in future ichthyophagists may have more dainty dishes,
And the fish of other waters in our English seas appear.
Though the Cynic may sneer at them with a supercilious “Gammon!”
There are ardent Men of Science who have promised, if you please,
To produce that “ Piscis major”—a miraculous Thames salmon,
o will beat the Salmo salar from the Severn or the Tees.
And our fish will be much º: when the coming Exhibition
Shall show fishers how to gather best the harvest of the sea.

So, in exchange for the popular tenor, the audience accepted extra
songs from Madame TREBELLI and Mr. SANTLEy, but at the same
time evinced a strong determination to get all they could out of

real treat by singing Carmen's song “ Habanera,” and the latter
sang “The Erl King” splendidly. -
Those who have never heard Mr. SANTLEY's rendering of the
“Vicar of Bray,” have never really heard that song sung: the quiet
humour he throws into it is irresistible. A most interesting item in
the programme was the duet between the youthful couple, Miss
EDITH SANTLEx and Master HERBERT REEVEs. . Altogether, the
Concert, including the soothing performance of the “Anemoic
Unionists,” which was just thrown in to calm any tendency to
exuberance of animal spirits on the part of the audience, was a
great success.

THE HOUSE FULL OF ORDERS ; OR, TURNING OVER A NEW LEAF.
MoMDAY Night, Feb. 27.-Being detained in Downing Street for
private conference after the Members, had left, was a little late
in getting down to the House. Thought when I entered I'd made
a mistake and come in from behind the *:::::: chair. This
Session W. E. G. obligingly insisted on my having a key of the door
behind the SPEAKER's chair. Hadn't used it to-day, yet here, on
my left, were crowded benches and uproarious cheering. As a rule,
Liberals don’t know how to cheer, and when you hear a noise like
this, you naturally think it must be the Tories. I’ll back Mr.
Alderman Fowleh, Sir WALTER BARTTELOT and Mr. WAR.Ton to a
cheering match with the combined Liberal Party on any ordinary
night.
#, it seems, is not an ordinary night; cheering terrific and well
sustained; Conservatives shut up, abashed. Sir STAFFORD NobTHCOTE
evidently frightened to death, and wishes SALISBURY, who has raised
the whirlwind, would kindly come and ride upon it. A good many
Peers in the Gallery; but my Lord SALISBURY has engagements
elsewhere.
In this dilemma Mr. NEW DEGATE rises with deepening gloom and
unsurpassable melancholy in his voice. If the #. would only
have listened to him—is it forty or fifty years since P-all would have
been well. He has been in the House now nearly a hundred years
but never, heard or saw anything equal to, this—never. Someone
reminds him that two days ago he was equally melancholy, and five
days previously had been in the same degree oppressed by the con-
sciousness of evil-doing. Mr. NEWDEGATE only shakes his head
with solemn sadness and sits down. Brings out a scarlet pocket-
handkerchief; holds it *]. in his right hand, and shakes
his head with growing depression as the conversation proceeds.
Sometimes varies, this by crying, “IIear! Hear !” No one quite
º what is the matter with him, but everybody respects his
gr1eſ.
Things get a little livelier on the Division. Sir STAFFoRD, seeing
how the enemy looked, wanted to draw back his gage of battle, but
the Land-League lº had come out for a fight, and º meant to
have it. Forced the Division, and English Country Gentlemen went
out in defence of the House of Lords shoulder to shoulder with Mr.
BIGGAR and Mr. HEALY.
1. the late Postmaster-General on the way to the Division
Obby.
“Beware, my Lord,” said I, “that evil communications do not
corrupt JoHN MANNERs.”
“Bad job, Toby,” he answered; “but, as I have said, before, you
Radicals really must spare, Oh spare, our old nobilitee.”
Business done.—House of Lords spanked by 300 against 167.
Tuesday Evening.—House Counted Out at half-past eight. Passing
through the Lobby at thirty and a half minutes past eight, saw a
stranger standing by the doorway under, the .. Coat and hat
on, umbrella in hand, just ready for a bolt.
“Pleasant change this, Toby,” he said...
Thought I knew the voice. On inspection found it belon to
Lord Rich ARD GRosvKNort. Perfectly astonishing the way he got
into the coat, and hat, well inside of thirty seconds. Not so sur-
prising though, as the fact that as a rule he is content on most days
not to see coat and hat till two or three in the morning, having been
slaving like a coalheaver since the House met. Talk about your
ten-hours Bill, and your early closing movement. Let some of them
come and do a Whip's work for a night. All work and small thanks.
If º go wrong you are blamed ; if right, somebody else is
credited.
Rather fancy if my father had been a Dook instead of respectable
bull-dog, I should have left this slavery to other people.
“Don’t you find it a bore ?” I asked Lord RICHARD, at two o'clock
one morning, when he had been at it since four o'clock on the
previous afternoon.
“Yes,” he said; “but it's nothing like the other bore of the
Channel Tunnel.”
Business done.—House agreed, after three hours' debate, that a
convict cannot also sit in Parliament.
Thursday Night.—Most surprising place this H. of C. Here’s the
QUEEN been shot at, BRADLAUGH re-elected, and the Constitution
otherwise in danger, owing to a little difficulty with the Lords.
And yet the House nearly empty, the few present being half asleep.
“Rome fiddling whilst Nero was burning nothing to this,”, says
Sir CHARLEs ForsTER, pausing in the search for his hat to glance
around the chamber.
Short stout gentleman on his legs drawing touching picture of the
condition of the Irish landlord, driven from home with a wallet on
his back, taking a steerage passage to America, and drinking the
water of affliction out of a tin pannikin.
“Who is this moving orator P” I ask Sir WILFRID PAwson
making believe I had an eyelash in my eye, whereas it was a tear of
º
“Hush l’” said Sir WILFRID, “that's Sir HARVEY DUFF. For
goodness sake don't whistle, or FoESTER will take you up and drop
you in Kilmainham.” -
I was in no humour, for whistling, having indeed a rooted objec-
tion to the practice in other people. But I might have dona..it
without danger. WILFRID LAwson terribly inaccurate man. The
orator isn't HARVEY DUFF, but HARVEY BRUCE.
Sorry I waited to hear DICKson, who followed. . Comes from same
art of the country, and plainly tells House that in all the North of
reland isn't a more rack-renting landlord than Sir HARVEY. Begin
to wish I had that tear back. As the poet sings, “Give back the
tear that thou weepest.” Ask Mr. SHAw what a rack-renter means.
Explains it’s a landlord who makes the tenant pay rent for every-
thing—even for his pipe-rack.
HARcount in hot water to-night. Wish I'd moved for the Return

I *# of last week. Might have had it by this time,
and HARcouBT would have been spared the contumely.
Will make speeches in reply to questions, and, what’s
worse, insists on being funny or cutting as the case may
be. House likes impromptus, but does not like to see
the foolscap H. er on which they are written. STANLEY
LEIGHTON asked foolish question in not very good taste.
Better have confounded him with severely matter-of-
fact reply. Not in HARcoURT's line that. The inter-
loper must be crushed. So Nasmyth hammer brought
out, and nutshell laboriously placed in position. Con-
servatives see their opportunity, and use it. HARCOURT
clearly out of order, and the clöture is relentlessly
brought down upon him. Sad waste of wit. Impromptu
remains enshrined in the foolscap. Worst of it is,
won't do for future use. Home SECRETARY sits down
.# to himself as he thinks of the many unoccupied
cells in various prisons under his command.
“If he could only issue letters dee catchett,” says
Mr. BIGGAR, who didn’t live two months in the heart
of Paris for nothing, “wouldn't they catch it P”
Must really get out my Return. In the meantime
IoME SECRETARY should listen, to DILKE at question
time, and see how Ministers should answer questions.
Business done.—None.
Saturday Morning.—BRADEAUGH down on the Bills for
last night... Couldn't play owing to his part having been
mislaid; House crowded. Three Judges in the gallery.
Insisted on having their money back at the doors. Box-
keeper just handing them the coin, when Serjeant-at-
Arms came up and said they’d been admitted with
Orders. More will be heard of this.
House wasted time up to one this morning, then began
work, and sat all night.

DOCTORS AND DRESS,
(From the Feminine Point of View.)
DEAR JULIE,
I went to the Lecture—the Lecture you know about Dress;
'Twas delivered by Mr. FRED TREves, an extremely nice F.R.C.S.,
I had fancied all fellows with letters attached to their names were old guys,
But this pleasant young surgeon was really as charming as-probably—wise.
You will ask what he said; well, of course, 'twas the same old old story, my dear,
About corsets, and crampings, and colds, which we’ve heará for this many a year.
| When will the men learn 'tisn't virtue or taste that the fashion-book sways,
Qr get tired of their stale iterations concerning qur shoes and our stays *
They have tried it for centuries now, and indeed I'm inclined to believe
It was ADAM who gave the first Lecture—concerning her fig-leaves—to EVE.
But their physiological nonsense, and high-flying talk about taste,
Never shortened the sweep of a train or extended the girth of a waist.
What has THoRwaldsEN's Venus to do with it? Really, my dear, this, between
us, 18
Almost the worst of the rubbish—this stuff about Art and Stone Wenuses,
We are not marble or Greek, and cannot go about in Society
Decked in diaphanous vesture as scanty as void of variety.
Therefore—but what use in †† ? What the poor men have to learn is
That we care no more about logic than TAMERLANE cared for attorneys. .
Dear, droll Mr. TREVEs—he was droll, dear, and never attacked us abusively-
Proved all his smartly-put points, I have not the least doubt, most conclusively.
Après £ In matters of Fashion mere proof doesn't count for one fraction;
And truth is entirely irrelevant. Fancy a man's stupefaction
In trying to realise that, dear ! ...And yet till they do they may bandy
Tart argumentations for ever; they º have no locus standi.
Their war on our waists is time wasted. It may be they ought to be oval,
And twenty-nine inches in girth, though the very idea of it drove all
The blood #. my cheeks in sheer horror... If Nature to one of my stature
Gave such—shall I say “Jumboesqueness”?—I’d die—or improve upon Nature.
That’s it; Nature’s nought in itself, raw material merely for Fashion,
Like all other Arts, just to mould as she pleases. It rouses one's passion
To thiſ:.." in Painting, BURNE-Jon Es and Sir FREDERICK are given such
eedom,
They'd bind us to work d la MILLET--that is, my dear Girl, if we'd heed 'em.
Mr. T. with his jokes on our “zones,” three, the temperate, frigid, and
rrld,—
(To treat us as though we were maps, I admit was a leetle bit º
Our “layers”—but there he went wrong—and his other half-humorous
strictures, -
Forgot we don't want to be “principles”—“laws”— *...* pictures;
Pretty Land that not according to stupid fixed standards; we vote “use,”
And '. ” mere drifts of the day, with no more of fixed form than old
roteus.
Change and Cenformity—they’re the sole rules of the feminine praxis,
The former forms Fashion's vast orbit, the latter may stand for its axis.
Compº with these, questions of health—such as whether one breathes free or
st111es,
Anatomy, comfort, Greek taste, I assure Mr. TREVEs are mere trifles. .
Our first law is ºe in the fashion,” though doctors may deem it enormity,
If they can sway Fashion, all right, but they must not expect nonconformity.
Still Mr. FRED THEVEs was . I believe he intends to repeat it—, ,
The Lecture I mean—“the Sex" thronged so the hall was not able to seat it;
And if you're in town at the time, and a tiny bit tired of your Q.C.,
I’d strongly advise you to go, try my F.R.C.S., dear ! Yours, LUCIE.

THE BRAN-NEW MUNICIPALITY OF LONDON.
(Guildhall, April 1, 1883.)
MEETING OF THE Pooh LAW COMMITTEE.
MR. FROTH, Chairman of Committees (salary, £2,500 a year),
wrote to say that a previous engagement at Westminster Hall would
deprive him of the pleasure of presiding on that interesting occasion,
§ Mr. DEAL, Deputy Chairman (salary, £1,500 a year), took the
alr.
A considerable time was lost in making a quorum, several of the
members being quite knocked up with the immense amount of work
they had to get through daily, two of them being affected with
softening of the brain from the constant strain upon that organ, in
carrying out their melancholy and depressing duties, and the Sub-
Finance Committee being aid up from sheer exhaustion in
preparing a Financial Report embracing the total expenditure, in
minute detail and under various heads, upon the 90,000 paupers
under their care, and the thirty large staffs of officials who have
charge of them.
Several Clerks entered, bearing baskets full of Reports and other
voluminous documents relating to their various large establishments.
The Principal Clerk announced that there were twenty-seven
}. of complaints, sixty-nine tenders for provisions, clothing
Irniture, stationery, &c., &c., to be opened and discussed, an
nineteen applications for increase of salary, besides the immense
amount of arrears of their ordinary, work, which was constantly
increasing, and which he saw no possibility of their ever overtaking
unless they sat de die in diem.
Mr. JoELIBQY (City Division) said it was all very fine for well-paid
officials to talk of sitting de die in diem, which {: supposed meant
all day and every day till they all died ; but, for his part, what with
the fearful amount of work they to do, and its dreadfully
monotonous and depressing character, he had very little doubt he
should himself yºry shortly be occupying a place in one of their
numerous Asylums |
The Committee, after sitting about six hours, and scrambling
through about a twentieth part of the work before them, and
arranging for their monthly visit to their various Small-Pox and
Fever Hospitals, Night Refuges, and Lunatic Asylums, adjourned
till the following day.
It having been suggested by Mr. Jollſ Boy that the Committee
should dine together after their protracted sitting, Mr. SCREw
(Chelsea Division) said “he hoped there was no intention to follow
the frightful example set them by the old Corporation which they had
superseded.” So the utterly exhausted Committee went empty away.
+ * + * * *
At the next meeting of the General Council, four resignations
were received from members of the Poor Law Committee; and the
worn-out and haggard-looking Town Clerk was directed to take the
necessary steps for the election of their successors.
The Town Clerk, in a faint whisper, the mere ghost of his former
manly voice, said that, as the first step would be to issue circulars
addressed to 43,700 electors, he should require some considerable
temporary addition to his over-worked Staff to enable him to get the
circulars out in the short time allowed by the law. -
Mr. ScKEw (Chelsea Division) moved that the Town Clerk's appli-
cation be not complied with, which was carried; whereupon the
Town Clerk handed in his resignation, and the Court broke up in
wild disorder. -
Several leading members of the late Municipal Reform Association
are already announced as candidates for the vacant office.

THE SON OF IA-CULTCHA.
Is THIS THE SoN of CULTCHA's SHADowy ForM P
I.
A. TALE of the times of old ' Where art thou, beam
of light? Why, thou bearer of the Lily, thou wanderer
unseen, hast thou left these shores? ... No sound of thy
song comes now. I hear but the roaring blasts. Strike
the harp and sound the song ! The son of Cultcha
has gone to the Land of Strangers. Can I forget that
beam of light, that breeze of the valley, the long-lock'd
sunbeam of love? I have heard the mournful tale.
When the hero left these shores, three days he stayed
in the ship unseen—alone. It is dark. emeteor of
night is dim. The sea darkly tumbles beneath the ship.
Slowly, with unequal steps, he ascends the deck. Un-
frequent blasts rush through his hair. Grief is dwelling
in his soul. The song is faint on his lips. His face is
like the darkened moon. His arms hang disordered b
his side. His hair spreads wide across his fage. Wit
trembling steps he nears.the edge-He, feels the unseen
foe! See ğ. mighty hero fails!! Thrice he
sighs over the dark billows. Thrice they echo back the
mournful sound!. He bends his head above the sable
surge!! Then with a bursting sigh, he pours his signs
on night!!! º of Love, let me forget
that dreadful sound. The hero resumes his soul. He
ains the upper deck. He pours the song “My soul,
lambent maiden, lies far away in thy bower; but my
corse is on this all-too-rolling ocean. Never more
shalt, thou flop with Ia-Cultcha's chosen, son, nor
sweetly sigh over a new ‘ º I am light as the
feather of our love, yet my limbs support not this airy
will ye roll around me, Q darkly
tumbling ocean]". Near, two sailors receive his words,
Swap’EM of decks, and STARNo, foe of strangers. They
rose in their wrath. “Swab'EM, lay that wanderer low,”
said STARNo, in his pride, Swab'EM heaves his marlin-

HARRY TAKES HI8 FIR8t START in LIFE.
HARRY was a foundling from his earliest
youth.
He was discovered one night in a dark lane
by the kind Vicar of the place, who happened
at that time to be Parson BYE, The Vicar
himself constructed a cradle—he was cele-
brated for his vicar-work—and tended the
babe with the utmost care.
His excellent preserver's motto was, “May
we never want an infant or a bottle to give
him,” and on this treatment little HARRY
throve wonderfully.
One night he woke Parson BYE, and said,
“Please tell me the secret of my birth; ”

“No,” replied Parson BYE, as he swallowed
the remains of his *ś which was still
by the bedside. “You hadn't a rag on of

“Old HARRY. Yes,” replied the excellent

sleep.
“I am of noble descent,” said the boy
proudly.
The worthy old Clergyman frowned. He
disliked dissent of any sort, noble or otherwise.
But there was no time for explanation, for
HARRY, mistaking his kind friend's manner
for an expression of repugnance, exclaimed,
“You shall never see me more, till my deeds
shall have proved my title,” and dashing out
of the room, locked the door on the outside.
Then, for with all his bravery and daring he
had a tender heart, he whispered “Hush-a-

late hour the next morning, he found on his
study table a short note to this effect-

“The lad has a generous nature,” said the
Vicar to himself, “and in after years this
may be an interesting reminiscence.” So
saying, he placed the document carefully in
his pocket-book, and rang the bell.
Only one servant had seen Master HARRY,
late on the previous night, making faces at
himself in the looking-glass. . .
“Why did you not stop him?” asked
Parson BYE, somewhat wrathfully. “Did
you not see he was taking himself off P”
But 'twas too late: he had gone.
Then Parson BYE went to his bureau. It
was unlocked.
In another second he realised the true
value of the writing in his possession, and
the good old man in his heart of hearts
devoutly wished that HARRY might obtain
that title and those estates of which he had
gone in search, and might never forget all he
owed his sorrowing benefactor.
CHAP. II.
A Fearful, encountera.
HARRY was now his own master, so he at
once proceeded to get on good terms with
himself, ordering himself about, and obeying
with an alacrity that bespoke the most perfect
discipline; at the same time conversing with
himself in the most confidential manner, yet
in such a way, that familiarity was ever
tempered by respect.
“My dear HARRY,” he said to himself,
“your one object in life must be to find your
parents. For that purpose you must go all
over the world if necessary. Never forget
the fifty* you borrowed from excellent
Parson BYE, and never, never, think of
returning to that, part of England, you have
just quitted, until you can do so with feelings
of generous pride and pleasure.”
" Hallo, HARRY | " shouted a youthful
voice, addressing him by name.
HARRY at once recognised his playmate
JACK PooDIN, who, two years since, had
run away from home to join a travelling
circus. -
“I’ll go with you,” cried JACK, heartily,
after hearing HARRY's plan for the future.
“I know all about Indians, and Pirates, and
here's a cutlass I’ve been doing the combats
with. I can bring the highly trained steed,
we must get on.”
As HARRY grasped his friend's hand, he
started, for on the balcony above he had
caught sight of the loveliest pair of eyes he
had ever beheld.
JAck saw the direction of his glance, and
º* { Don't you know her ?”
o
“That's the Spanish Dancer. Her name's
CACHUCA.”
At that instant, CACHUCA, a beautiful dark-
eyed maiden from the sunny South, whose
smile displayed a front row of dazzlin
pearls of which the Great Mollusk himself
might well have been º glided from
her seat, and approached HARRY, as JACK
after whispering in his ear that he would
return in two minutes with the steed, dis-
creetly retired.
HARRY was fascinated, and stood rooted to
the spot.
All at once arose a shriek of
ny.
Merchants, clerks, traders of
sorts, were
hurrying pèle mêle terrorstricken out of the
Exchange, which was the centre of commerce
in this thriving seaport town.
“The Bull | The Bull !”
Bursting his bonds, scattering jobbers and
speculators of all sorts left and right, on
came the monster*. at every paw,
tossing its own head in sheer cruel wanton-
ness for practice sake, until it could reach
something else to toss. -- -
For one second it Fº as if in search of
an object on which to wreak its terrible
vengeance, and now, for the first time, caught
sight of CACHUCA. -
CACHUCA, motionless with fear, could only
shriek out in despairing accents, “Save me !
Save me!”
The Bull had already made a hundred run,
he now made one rush.
Have you ever seen a bull rush in the
middle of a street, with a helpless girl right
in front of it?
It is an awful sight.
HARRY, who never as yet been daunted
by the largest bull's eye, quailed for an in-
stant only. -
But in that instant the savage beast
heralded his approach with a tremendous
flourish of his two horns, previous to giving
the right pitch to the º CACHUCA,
and would have got her up in the air, where
she might have been joined by HARRY in
a second, but for the latter's presence of
mind. -
Seizing the cutlass which JAck had left
behind him, HARRY ran forward to confront
the beast, as CACHUGA, throwing up her arms
in despair, fell within an inch of the in-
furiated animal's horns.
(To be continued.)
A PARTY AT THE PLAY.
SIR,-When you requested me to assist at the first night of The
Manager at the Court Theatre, I acceded gladly to your demand.
When you asked me, on our next meeting, what I thought of the
iece, I, with considerable diplomatic skill, referred you to the
#. papers. You, with considerable alacrity, referred me to the
door. hen again you asked me to visit the Court Theatre, I said
I would, º murmuring the while, “What have I done to deserve
this?” Sir, I am glad of that second visit. The Manager goes
with roars of laughter from first to last. It is capitally played.

he couldn't be spared. Good is Mrs. LEIGH, admirable is Mr. KEMBLE,

* ROMEO AND JULIET* AT THE LYCEUM.
“C” est magnifique, mais ce n'est pas—l'amour,” is what one feels inclined to
º after witnessing the superbrevival of Romeo and Juliet at the Lyceum. This
judgment may require some qualification perhaps, but it is probably a pretty
close approximation to the truth.
Magnificentitis. As a series of stage pictures it is unprecedented, and can
scarcely be surpassed. Some of the scenes–notably Capulet’s garden and Juliet's
chamber—might betransferred to canvas with but little alteration, and accepted
as striking and satisfactory works of Art, having a grace of composition worthy
of Dicksee or of FREDERick WALKER, and a charm of colour suggestive of
BURNE-Jones or of HolmAN Hunt. And if the presence of the picturesqueness
that charms could compensate for the absence of the passion that moves, this
revival would indeed be a distinguished and unqualified success.
But of Romeos it might almost be said, as it has been said of poets, that they
are born, and not made. And that Mr. IRVING is a born Romeo, can hardly
be maintained. The “manufactured, article”, may be flºº. impressive,
and sometimes fine, but that it should lack spontaneity and the nameless charm
of the inevitable, is hardly surprising. Perhaps the more temperate admirers
of Mr. IRVING will be inclined to say that his Romeo is better than they ex-
pected. If it is not the ideal Romeo, it is an interesting impersonation; not
weak, not grotesque, sometimes graceful, always thoughtful and eareful, onl
something, different from, SHARSPEARE's type of essentially youthful .
romantic if absorbed and “star-cross'd'' passion.
fact, one has a strange feeling all through, that it is not so much love that
is moving Mr. IRVING to such intense and sometimes exaggerated action,
as some other strong emotion of a more mature spirit than the Romeo of the
drama, something, which might be the perturbation of Hamlet, or the wildness
of Macbeth, which is not distinctively and necessarily the fate-crossed passion
of an amorous and ill-disciplined youth for a lovely Italian girl.
The same comparative maturity of feeling seems to permeate Miss TERRY's
- rsonation of Juliet, to a less degree perhaps, but still continually and un-
eably. Her deliberate intensity has little of the warm impulsiveness,
checked ever and anon by girlish misgivings, which we
naturally look for in the youthful daughter of the
Capulets.
#. importance of this º not easily definable
divergency from what seems the Shakespearian ideal, will
no doubt be differently estimated by different minds,
but it gives a tone to the entire performance.
In the earlier scenes Romeo's depression seems almost
more the boding moodiness of a hero of tragedy, than the
mere mooniness of a fantastic lover, whilst Juliet is
more triste and “intense” in her demeanour than afancy-
free girl of fifteen needs be, one would think—at any rate
when dancing a minuet. But Miss Tºny's acting when
Romeo introduces himself and bandies amorous fantasies
with his new innamorata, is charmingly girlish, with an
innocent tender exultation which is quite in the tone of
ºt. The Balcony Scene is very beautiful as a scene,
anºl-
“Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,”
be a very interesting wooer indeed. The difficulties of
making love partially by dumb-show from the fº!
level to a lady perched out of reach above, are fairly sur-
mounted, there is no pump-handle passion, and the
amorous pantomime is not more ludicrous than is perhaps
inevitable; though Mr. IRVING, hiding behind a tree about
as thick as a hickory sapling, is somehow inopportunely
suggestive of a policeman secreting himself in the shadow
of a lamp-post. Miss TERRY looks lovely, but one cannot
quite º at she looks love—the love of Juliet at least,
which surely would not be so deliberately and almost
monotonously “intense” either in action or rhetoric,
but more radiant, swift and º in m and
tone. Charming iove-making, of its kind, but there
is not much movement in it, and it does not greatly
In ove.
In the Scene with the Nurse on the Terrace of Capulet's
Garden, Miss TERRY is animated and graceful, and there
is considerable º in the Loggia Scene, when the
Nurse brings the news of Tybalt's death and Romeo's
banishment. And the power is shown without strain or
extravagance. This can hardly be said of Mr. IRVING's
frenzied outbreakin Friar Laurence's cell when the same
news is brought to him. Romeo's despair is so wildly
unrestrained as to become almost abjectly ignoble, and
the introduction of Mr. IRVINg's favourite business with
his body linen seems almost suggestive of poverty of in-
vention in the rendering of emotional pantomime.
The Bed-Chamber Scene is simply exquisite, as a pic-
ture, nor can the acting here, either of Mr. IRVING or
Miss TERRY, be said to be unworthy of so superb a setting.
More of youth and of warm passion are manifested here
than in any other part of the play, and the parting at the
window, as the sun rises over lovely foliage into a
sky of pre-Raphaelite radiance, is admirable, whether
considered as picturesque spectacle or emotional acting.
Admirable also is Miss TERRY in the scene and
...}} preceding her taking of the Friar's draught;
genuinely powerful and impressive both in gesture and
elocution.
In the Scene with Balthasar and the Apothecary,
Mr. IRVING is almost at his best. Is he awarehow far
more effective he is in these moments of restrained inten-
sity of voice and bearing, which are such welcome—if too
occasional—specialities of his acting, than when tearing
a passion, º his linen, to tatters?
he catastrophe in the tomb is well managed and
strongly acted—save for the somewhat ludicrous trailing
of the body of County Paris—and the play closes as it
has proceeded, picturesquely, impressively-everything
but movingly.
First impressions of a performance which must charm
and, in parts, deeply interest, even if as a whole it cannot
satisfy one's ideal of what Mr. IRVING aptly calls “the
Italian warmth, life, and romance (we may add fervent
youthfulness) of this enthralling love-story.”
Of the minor performers we can only now say that Mrs.
STIRLING is, at all points, admirable as the Nurse:
that Mr. TERRIss, as Mercutio, is admirable at almost all
points; that Mr. FERNANDFZ is an excellent Friar
Laurence; Mr. MEAp a sufficiently grim and cadaverous
Apothecary; Mr. GLENNY a satisfactorily truculent
Tybalt; Mr. Howe an adequate Capulet; and Miss L.
PAYNE as cold and chin-lifting a Lady Capulet as ever
was ill-fitted with the charge of an ardent and imagina-
tive daughter.

museums and art galleries. It assumes that they are simply collections of
curiosities intended for the amusement of idle spectators, which may be
carted about the country like the monstrosities of a peripatetic showman . . . .
London is not merely the capital of the nation, but of a great empire, and th
embodiment of that empire's highest activities. Jealousy of its possession
of the national treasures is the narrowest and most miserable manifestation of
provincialism that it is possible to conceive.”—Daily Paper.

Educational Enthusiast (making for one of the large halls). Yes,
and as I was saying, these magnificent and imperial collections when
once stored here have by no means accomplished the whole of their
beneficent work. Oh, dear no! On the contrary, they may be said
only to have just commenced it; for from this fruitful centre all the
pººl aspirations towards artistic training are not only fanned
ut fed. . (With pride.) . There is not a borough in the three king-

enterprising Mayor, that may not command and secure on loan, for
an indefinite period, the very choicest art treasures that these walls
contain; But now, let me see, –where is the Teniers ? (Looking
at number of room.). Ah! here we are! (Referring to Catalogue,

ESSENCE OF
PARLIAMENT.
Extracted from
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
-
IIouse of Commons, Monday Evening, March 6.-BRADLAUGH
again! Getting a little monotonous. Nothing to look for but the old
game. Tired to death of the Parliamentary cancan with the
Sergeant-at-Arms. Sick of BRADLAUGH posturing at the Bar.
Laugh no more at LABBy “defending the British Constitution ”;
nor weep any more to find how little we’ve learnt these fifty years.
“Going to vote with us?” said Mr. NEwdegaTE, as Mr. CALLAN,
Mr., BIGGAR, Mr. HEALy, and a troup of faithful Irish Members
filed into the Division Lobby. “Now that's nice and kind. If it
hadn't been for the Duke of WELLINGTON and Robert PEEL in ’39,
you wouldn't have been here to help us. So it’s all for the best.”
Not so monotonous after all. BRADLAUGH i. a genius. Went
on quite new tack to-night. Sat under the Gallery as quiet as if he
had exhausted his swearing capacity, and couldn't say a bad word if
he put forth all his force. All over by eight o'clock. GLADSTonk
moved Address to the QUEEN, on getting Clean out of the difficulty
with MAC. Members so profoundly moved that they had to leave
the House in large numbers. Scores of them led fainting into the
dining-rooms, where they crowded the tables, and ate their dinner
whilst to empty benches the PREMIER and Leader of the Opposition
made speeches congratulating the QUEEN.
Debate on Lords' Committee to follow. All speakers, few hearers.
CLAUD HAMILTON lustily shaking the Abercorn pepper-box over
GLADSTONE. Accuses him and BRIGHT of “reaching the united age
of 140” and never spending six months in Ireland.
“You’ve been there a good deal, my Lord?” Sir CHARLEs For-
STER said, meeting him after the debate, and furtively taking the
opportunity to examine his hat.
“Of course I have,” says CLAUD. “Know every bit of the
country.” -
“Ah!” says Sir CHARLEs. “Well, I've such a continual bother
with my hat. Always losing it, don't you know. Takes me
hours searching for it: haven't time to go into these matters myself.
But I wanted to know all about Ireland. And you’ve been there a
good deal, and GLADSTONE and BRIGHT haven't? Fancy the way to
learn most about Ireland is not to visit it. Haven’t seen a hat any-
where, have you?—rather large size, name inside”— But Lord
CLAUD was gone.
Business done.—House, for the third time, declines Mr. BRAD-
LAUGH's company. .
Tuesday Night.-Nice pleasant, afternoon discussing Canals,
Railways, and the arrangement of the position of lamp-posts at
Accrington, Blackburn, Bolton, and .. important centres of
population. At one moment Ministerial crisis threatened. Minis-
terialists wanted three lamp-posts on the right-hand side of the main
street, as you go up, and two on the other: Conservatives insisted
on having three on the other, and only two on this. Finally, after
two hours' debate, compromise effected. There will be two on each
#: But these things shake the Imperial Parliament to its founda-
10ns.
After three hours and a half of exciting conversation of this kind,
PREMIER obliged to abandon intention of renewing the debate on the
Rºw with the Lords, and at half-past eight House Counted Out.
Mr. ARTHUR O'ConnoR quite pensive. Reminds him of early days, he
says, when he was on the other vestry at Chelsea. Mr. Alderman
LAWRENCE sniffs at House of Commons, says the Common Council
of Hººdoº is quite an important gathering by comparison.
We,” says the Alderman in stentorian whisper, “would have
left this,to private committee, who would have had a little dinner,
and settled the matter of whilst taking their coffee.”
But then the Alderman was vexed because the House would not
let him read the whole of Mr. Justice HAWKINs remarks on
sentencing the Embankment Roughs. Fact is, Parliament must
look after the affairs of the Nation. The Bolton Lamp-posts, the

SOME OF THE HEADS OF THE GOVERNMENT.
Accrington News Boys, and the Blackburn Nurseries are part of the
affairs of the Nation. Let us begin at the beginning. We’ll get up
in due time to larger affairs.
Young CLAUD burnt his fingers last night when he attacked GLAD-
ston E for describing Earl GREY’s º as old-womanish.
Whatever W. E. G. may think on the subject, it would be safe to
contradict any assertion that he said so. Lord CLAUD º made
the statement stuck to it with the audacity of youth, and undertook
to prove it. Found to-night he could not do so. Would have been
better to make frank apology and recantation. Instead, attempted
to argue the matter. Smitten by thunder-bolts hurled by Jove,
who was exceedingly wrath.
Business done.—None.
Wednesday Afternoon. — Another pleasant afternoon with the
lawyers. Monk brought in a Bills of Sale Bill, Tried to throw a
clerical, not to say an episcopal air over it. Might have succeeded
if left to himself. Speech would have E.; for a bishop's ;
and the measure under discussion might have been known as the Bills
of Sale Bull. But the lawyers would not have it so. “Can't have the
Church meddling with our matters,” HENRY JAMES said in his
snappish way.
“But Monk is not an emissary of the Church, though his name is
against him.” -
“So is his º JAMEs insists. “It’s no use his wearing
that dusty miller's suit year after year, and going out in July
just like a young man about town. When he's at home every-
One knows e wears gaiters, a broad-brimmed hat, and a bishop's
apron.
JAMEs really seemed to take the thing to heart. When later he
got up to speak, there was a general depression in his manner and
tone of his voice, suggestive of a funeral service. ...HARcquET
always is funereal when he is not funny, and sometimes then,
Invariably appears on these occasions, for fear the House should
forget he once knew a little law. ... Would have thought he had
enough on his mind with charge of the Magistracy and other crimi-
nal classes, without poking his finger into purely legal discussion.
Only want Mr. GREGoRY to complete the delirious joy of the after-
noon. For a thoroughly depressed care-cankered, man, give me
GREGORY. Believe he is a solicitor in a respectable practice, and
takes the money at the Foundling. Otherwise, a large field open
to him as an undertaker.
As CHARLEs RUSSELL says, “GREGoRY walking at the head of
an otherwise well-conducted funeral would make the fortune of a
struggling firm.” -
Nothing mean about CHARLEs RussRLL. No superior-branch-
of-the-profession airs about him when a solicitor in large practice
is under discussion. Only wish he would not think it necessary
from time to time to deliver such tremendous orations on Ireland.
Business done.—About ten lawyers made speeches without fees.
Thursday Afternoon.—Great joy, everywhere. ... An end of this
wearisome debate about the naughty boys in the Lords. Great
rush of talent for the last night. Mr. Butt, a gentleman of sin-
gularly mild manners, opens the debate. . .
“Doesn't look as if butter would melt in his mouth,” as Mr. Cotes
says.
Hien CHARLEs LEwis, who talks, like a Police Court Lawyer,
discusses the Solicitor-General for Ireland as if he were the prisoner
in the dock, and shakes a fat forefinger at the SPEAKER, as if he
were a Magistrate on the Bench, strongly suspected of having, a
pecuniary interest in the case; the Solicitor-General virtuously
indignant; Sir PATRICK O'BRIEN mellifluently incoherent; Mr.
ARTHUR MooRE, with his voice getting the better of him; shouting
at random; Mr. CHAPLIN, with some more parodies of the Disraelian
manner; Mr. SMYTH, with fresh leaves from Enfield's Speaker :

“Oh, PAPA DEAR I thought row were going to CHAPRRoN ME I werer GET A PARTNER when MAMMA comes 1"
2.
MI-CAR£ME.
The Story of a Determined Attempt.
It is always the way. ALPHONSE reflects, according to his inva-
riable custom at this time of year, the first three Fat Days are
failures, because one has just been having an indigestion of New
Year and Twelfth Day. A man requires the austerity of Lenten
fare to make him properly appreciate the ecstasies of the Mi-
Caréme; and this time they are going to be ecstasies. Limited
myself to a pint of Montebello a day, and one day actually had an
exclusively fish dinner (cabillaud, truite hollandaise, red mullet, and
a frture des merlans) to give me an adequate appetite for the joys
of Mid-Lent. I have sworn to appreciate them ever since I can
remember, and never succeeded since I have been out of my lycée
tunic; but this time I shall do the thing thoroughly, di la Gavarni,
sacré anything that happens to be handy if I don't.
The first step towards doing the thing thoroughly is getting a false
nose. Nothing really rapturous to be done at Mi-Carème without a
false nose. Consult authors of antiquity, dating as far back as 1830,
and discover that the best, the most classic type of false nose has a
moustache attached. Send for classic type. EuPHRosyNE, the bonne,
away two hours, and gives warning on her return: is not going to
do errands that make her look ridiculous, not to sayimproper; as if
EUPHRosYNE could be made to look anything but ridiculous enough
to be the very pink, the incarnation of propriety. Breakfast rather
a failure in consequence of Words—“words, not feeds,” the motto
on these domestic occasions. Found, however, the desired nose at a
ºric-dººrac shop on the Quay; supposed to have come straight down
from HENRI Murger, and łº, º: it, being a faded and flaccid
affair, that wouldn't seem so irºly comic if you hadn't made
up your mind to it. And how it tickles!
First comic effect, on concierge. A request for information as to
what wine I have had for breakfast, and an announcement that the
cordon would not be pulled when I wanted to come in.
Second comic effect, on divers blouses. Wituperation in too dis-
tinctly precious. Zolaese; and a crowd of three hundred revellers
patiently following me to see me revel. I find it difficult; and
throwing some cigar-stumps isn't of material assistance. Form a
defensive alliance with the Only Harlequin—and— -
Third comic effect: find ourselves at the poste charged with
creating tumults, and obstructing the Republic's highway. Cry out
“Ohé beau masque,” to the Commissaire, just to keep him up to the
humour of the situation, and had to find bail in a thousandfrancs each.
Had the classical Mi-Caréme black-puddings at dinner—and didn't
feel quite like Mi-Caréme cancan afterwards; but resisted, with
the help of those little glasses which in time make spectacles of one;
and to the Opéra intent on orgies.
Conversation heard at orgie. “But the fact that Panama has held
its own, mon cher.”—“No, I rather think the Crédit Lyonnais being
still at par”—“ They 'll never get through with that Bankruptcy
Bill; Rouvre R says”—“Oh, 'ang it, ARRY, let’s do a drain; blest

THE two boys gripped each other's hands
in token of friendship. The trained steed
which JACK had brought from the circus,
was a strange-looking animal, almost bare-
backed, but for a strap supporting a couple
of pistols. No saddle or bridle.
“No reins,” observed HARRY.

HARRY, as he held on by the mane, “we can

It was at this hour that the highly-trained

trick with the pistols which she carried in
the holsters. She seized one of them with
her teeth, and with a tremendous effort shot
both the boys over her head.

Then their attention was directed to the

“Who are you?” asked the two boys in
the same breath. -
“Me am SAMBo. Me lib in de water.

They felt they could trust him. as he

In another moment they were in his boat
pulling furiously. -
But the black hull i. disappeared
as she went over the horizon and down the
other side. -
It was hard work pulling, and they were
getting very thirsty. They had had nothing
to eat or drink for twenty-four hours.
HARRY took some water in his hand and
drank it.
“Yet we must get
better than nothing ! see 1 A Leak! a

It was too late. In another second the
boat received a violent shock, and before
HARRY could realise the extent of the calamity,
his forehead struck against a sharp rock, and
he knew no more.

WHEN he recovered consciousness, he was
lying in what º to him to be a
naturally-formed Hall-by-the-Sea.
SAMBo and JACK were seated before a large
fire. On finding he was awake, JACK at once
brought him some honey.
f º Where did you get this?” asked HARRY
aintly.
J “Eat first, and ask afterwards,” replied
ACK.
As HARRY º ed the order, JACK
went on to inform him that the rocks were
honey-combed by nature, and this was the
result of their search.
The cavern, in which they were, was
spacious, warm, and well lighted. -
“Fortunately,” JACK explained, “I had

They were hopeful,
But where were the Pirates ? And what

two others remained behind, ready for action
at an instant's notice from their leader.
HARRY listened intently. The sound of a
small, bell arrested his attention. He crept
on ; then he traversed a long gallery; thence
he descended, and picked his way among a
lot of empty boxes, some numbered, and
some with names on them. To whom could
they belong P Where was he? Then he
game upon what he supposed must once have
been used for stables, º: which were now
merely rows and rows of empty stalls. Be-
ind these was a dark pit. "One step back,
and he would have fallen into it.
Suddenly, from his coign of vantage in one
of those stalls, he heard the sounds of music
and revelry, and then saw a heavy drapery
gradually ascend, and his heart beat high at
the extraordinary scene before him.
The Pirates of whom he was in search, in
iß". of costume, were playing,
drinking, dancing, dicing, in a spacious
cavern. They were armed to the teeth, which
were as false as their tongues, displaying
most formidable double-barrelled gums;
knives and pistols were in their belts, and
even the very dice they were playing with
were heavily loaded.
hree ferocious-looking men, evidently
the chiefs of the band, were conferring
together in the centre; while, a little way
from them, lay on a couch the unhappy
CACHUCA, evidently being comforted by her
friend DAisy, who sat by the pillow.
HARRY threw a yearning glance in their
direction, but luckily it fell on them without
attracting the Pirates' attention.
“Salt P” inquired JACK. -
“No,” replied HARRY, making an ugly
grimace. “Sour.”
This would have puzzled them, but for
SAMBo's explanation. -

OFFICIAL IGNORANCE I
THE Great Pooh-Pooh must be somewhat annoyed by the remarks
of Mr. Justice HAWKINs on the unchecked ruffianism of the Thames
Embankment. Perhaps we expect too much from a Seldom-at-Home
Secretary when we ask him to know something about the Govern-
ment of London, and we expect a great deal more when we ask the
Chief of the Police to help him with information. Sir EDMUND
HENDERSON may have many good qualities as a police official, but a
knowledge of metropolitan manners and habits is not prominent
amongst them, and he is º as honestly ignorant of the state
of the Thames Embankment as he is of the condition of the top of
the ºl. Scotland Yard is not far from either place, ... is
quite close to the Thames Embankment, but criminals never feel so
secure as they do when working under the very eyes of authority.
When a street gets very notorious, it is usual for Bumbledom to
alter its name, and probably this will be done in the case of the

Manager. Ah! You open the F. in the smoking-room of a
London Club? Excellent idea. roceed, my dear Madam, with
your description of the scene. I am all attention.
Jºistinguished Authoress (continuing the reading from her M.S.).
“The scene represents a spacious easy chamber, lined with the laziest
of divans, seen through a fog of smoke, and tenanted by nearly a
score of men in every imaginable loose velvet costume. Some are
puffing away, in, calm, meditative comfort, others are talking hard
and fast, while through the air, heavily weighted with the varieties
of tobacco, from tiny cigarettes to giant cheroots, from rough bowls
full of cavendish, to Sybaritic rose-water hookahs, a Babel of
sentences rises togethers. As these rush in amongst each other, and
are tossed across the eddies of smoke in the conflicting of tongues,
loosened in the tabagie and made eloquent, though slightly inarticu-
late by pipe-stems, the Curtain rises.
Enter a tall fair, man, with the limbs of a Hercules, the chest of
a prize-fighter, and the face of a Raphael angel—”

about horse-racing, monkeys, gambling, training on venison
and champagne, demi-monde broughams, welshers, muscle,
“the Guards' crack,” and other edifying trifles, carefully
selected with a view to high-class comedy.
Manager (slightly bewildered). Hum! Alittlejong, for a Prologue,
a little long. Hum—yes! Are we near the end?
Pistinguished Authoress. The End? Here you are—the last line.

“Enter St. John Milton. — He is a delicate handsome creature,
with a face like some pretty brunette's, and has the air of a man
who has been cut all to pieces a hundred times.”
Manager (dubiously). Hum ! . Difficult part. I suppose we must
put SMITH into it. But he won't look it.
Distinguished Authoress. No, you must get a French Marquis who
has matriculated in Africa: one who can speak English like a
SHERIDAN, and turn a double somersault like PAGONI. There are
hundreds of them waiting for an i.". on the quays where
º the ancient Carthage. You h etter telegraph. But listen
to this.
[Continues more brilliant dialogue, in which a Member of Par-
liament, a pleasant fellow, as gentle as a woman but as wild
as a grouse in November, listens to the cavalry officer’s
description of how he set the skulls of all the Asiatics he had
ever killed, in a row on the top of the flat roof of his house,
one illuminating night, in Calcutta, with the skulls all filled
up with clay, and a candle stuck into each, lighting up the
... jaws and shining through the orbless eyes.
Manager (rising). Oh, but, my dear Madam ' , Believe me, no

picture of the * British officer as commonly accepted in
society. , You must, I fear, thrilling as it is, cut out the skulls.
(Warming.). Why, there would be a roar!
Distinguished Authoress. At what? At the daring of a grande

after fifty minutes more of brilliant dialogue about Phryne, Apis,
t. John's, Wood, tigers' eyeballs, Pommery and, Greno, the Hol
Grail, and gold-hued tropical birds, continues.), “Any quite #.
scandal is a great ºff. If you be discussing a divorce, for
instance, you need not mind the presence of the relatives in the
least,-scarcely of the husband nowadays. The only person whose
feelings must not be hurt is the co-respondent. here this last

of them at the same time. They are sure to have either too much

Estimates down for Committee. CHILDERs talks about the law an
the necessity of having, a yote to-night... GLADSTONE makes appeals
on the score of public business. Mr. WARTON knows, these things
are meant for his ear, but is not to be turned aside from his
purpose.
“Army all very well, and Navy too,” he says to Mr. WHITLEY,
& but there's something undermining the constitution of this country,
sucking its heart's blood, and that is Patent Medicines. There are
Patent Medicines and Patent Medieines, I've tried 'em all. Pepsine
Pills, warranted to strike only on the box; Langallibale's Lotion;
the Anonymous Ointment; the Cheerful Cherry Pectoral; Cinder
Biscuits; Delicious Dog Soap ; Corn Plasters for the Corpulent;
Tigestible Worm Powders; the Wonderful Wafer; the Bashful Beetle
Poison; Widow Whelpton's Pills—I’ve tried 'em all, in short, and
now look at me! Been a good deal of talk, I know, about my wear-
ing gloves. Never had 'em off since the SPEAKER took the Chair.
Know what people say. Most of them think I’ve taken a vow
never to take my gloves off till GLADston E's deposed. All a flam,
dear. WHITLEY. Fact is, I’ve been experimenting with Patent
Medicines and Powders, till I rather expect you will see something
when I do take off my gloves.”
Interesting sight to see WARTON during early proceedings,
surrounded by flysheets of advertisements, and treatises on the
Pharmacopoeia. Also a choice selection of samples, bought regardless
of expense, at one shilling and three-halfpence the bottle, all neatly
arranged on the Bench, with interstices filled up by pill-boxes of
Signors Gorsto and Wartoni in their popular Duet, “Why don't he name
the day P”
various sizes. WARTON hands about a pill-box for snuff, but no one
cares for one just now. Tried very hard to get BIGGAR to take a
dose of the Immaculate Embrocation. BIgGAR said he was pretty
well at the moment; but accepted a small box of voice lozenges,
and a bottle of Towle's Cimolite, which he said he’d try on The
O'Gorm AN MAHON.
A few words on Egypt d propos Army Estimates. Then, passing
over Industrial Schools, we reach Mr. WARTon’s Motion. Unfor.
tunately at the moment. W. was refreshing himself with a packet
of soothing powder, having first rubbed into his hair a small bottle
of Mariani's Meat Juice. Just swallowing a dose of Congreve's
Chimethloplastron (recommended for chilblains), when he dis-
govered Mr., REDMOND on his legs, talking about Ireland. The
Irishman had stolen a march on him . He had lost his turn; and,
folding up his pill-boxes like the Arab, he stole away, though not
quite so silently, repeating to himself several times the form of
affirmation.
Business done.—Army Estimates introduced.
Tuesday Night.—“ McIyER is a well-meaning young man,” HAR-
º, aid just now, critically eyeing the Member for Birkenhead.
“But his Parliamentary manner is uncommonly like that of a Jack-
in-the-box.”
When one ºmes to think of it, that's true. Some kind of mental
dynamite suddenly goes off in the great mind of McIver, and in an
instant he is up on his feet. The #. roars. M. holds out hand
deprecatingly, and turns his innocent and spectacled face #. like
the late Mr. Toots) from side to side, feebly smiling. Gets of a few
words. SPEAKER interposes on point of order, and M. shoots down on
his seat as if the spring were withdrawn. Up again with hand
outstretched, and spectacled face more than ever like Mr. Toots.
“If the House will pardon me,” he says, in a voice that does not
seem to belong to him, “I will give them a few details.” -
House not inclined to pardon him in any circumstances. With
the prospect of a few details impossible. A sustained roar, as if
Jumbo had been got into the box, and was surprised to find the door
shut. It is now that M. is so like a Jack-in-the-Box. Momentarily
disappears from sight. Just as the House thinks all is over, there he
is again in exactly the same attitude, with hand pleadingly out-
stretched, a hysterical smile spread over the lower part of his
features, and head turning rapidly from side to side, like a Man-
darin in a tea-shop. House howls, M. disappears, brief silence,
M. shoots up again; whereupon such a roar, that his glasses jingle
on his nose. Concludes he will return to his speech another day.
House Counted Out at half-past seven. Not unreasonable, seeing
it sat till four this morning. ... “Most astonishing Fº this,” says
Mr. Lyon PLAYFAIR. “Last night, Government night, private Mem-
bers bring on miscellaneous motions occupying the time till a quarter
to One, when business begins. To-night, private Members' night;
might have had it all to themselves, and they all cut off like school-
boys, leaving House to be counted. If what took place last night
up to a quarter to One, had been transplanted to to-night, evening
might have been pleasantly occupied, and the business of the nation
might have been done.”
urious how old Members stick to traditions of the place. Here's
Lyon PLAYFAIR who, with all he has undergone, thinks the House
of Commons is a place where the primary object is to do business!
Thursday Night.—Here's ForstER been doing something again.
º to give up all hope of his reformation. Onlyflº looked in,
and don't know, yet what it is ; evidently something fearful. Expect
he's shot a landlord from behind a hedge: or been out marauding at
night with his face more than usually dirty, and ; one of a
arty of twenty, has dragged a man out of bed and shot him in the
ees; or, perhaps, it is a woman whom, being backed up by Young
Hopeful and º: by a body, of armed men, he's heroically
dragged out of her homestead, with murderous threats; or maybe
he's only ruined some tradesman by boycotting him; or perhaps
he’s been found out in the still more agreeable and gentlemanly
pursuit of living at ease in the Westminster Palace. Hotel on the
coppers of Irish servant-girls and the dollars of American Fenians.
on't wonder he looks so guilty with his head sunk on his breast,
and his hair in a state of revolution. Sail on, SExton I Bowl away,
BIGGAR 1 Hark forward, HEALY! Come on, CALLAN l Neyer let it
be said that because a man is a Minister he shall not be punished for
these things, or at least held up to the scorn of honest men.
Say all this to DILKE. “You’d better wait till you know what
it '; all about,” says he ; “it’s as well to do that before talking about
it.
It may be in ordinary circumstances, but it certainly is not par-
liamentary. DILKE says all this hullabaloo which has so excited my
ingenuous mind, is because ForsTER, when he went to speak at
Tullamore, let the Irish Times know, but didn't tell Freeman's
Journal... If that’s so, must tear out that leaf of my Diary. Have
had a little too much of the Freeman and its business affairs of
late. HEALY, the other day, stopped Committee of Supply while he
wanted to know why some advertisement was sent to “the Scotsman
of Glasgow’’ and not to Freeman's Journal. All very well to
help a colleague; but rather hard on the House.
Awson says he's going to strike a bargain with GRAY. Ask him
how much he’s lost on this and similar transactions. Propose a vote
in Supply and so have done with it. “Save several days in the
Session,” he says, “and the ... is rich.” WILFRID is evidently
coming round to correct views on the matter of compensation.
Business done.—Up to midnight none. Then TREVELYAN intro-
duced Navy Estimates in excellent speech.
Friday Night.—Everybody getting up Memorials to the PRIME
MINISTER about everything, C. RUSSELL wants the British
taxpayer to buy out the Irish Landlords, and 3. the holdings
to the Tenants. McFARLANE wants feather-beds for the suspects at
Kilmainham, and a sugar-basin a-piece when they take hot whiskey,
instead of having lumps doled out to them as at present. NEWDE-
GATE wants Mr. LABouch ERE expelled; and STAFFORD NoFTHCOTE
wants the loan of one of H. M. ships to be placed at the disposal of
RANDOLPH, so that he can on a cruise that will not bring
him. º: till September. these Memorials are “extensively
slºtleol, ––
ust do something myself. Session wearing on, and name’s
scarcely been in the papers. Shall get up Memorial to the PRIME
MINISTER, §. that grilled bones and London porter be supplied
to all Members on production of their cards, when the House sits

signed. -
IBusiness done.—Talk about Borneo. Some small votes in Supply.

ALMACK'S REDIWIWUS.
“There have been rumours for some months past that there would be a revi-
val of Almack's this season, and this proves to be the case.”—Morning Post.
ALMACK's again! how strange it
seems,
This last of Fashion's changes
And backward in the worl of
dreams
The Singer's fancy ranges;
To beaux and belles of ancient
days,
When CoRYDON and PHYLLIS
Won tribute from Morrisian
lays,
Within the halls of WILLIS,
They come each exquisite and
buck,
Who shook the dice at hazard,
And who, when flushed with wine
and luck,
Scored “Charleys” o'er the
mazard.
Each dandy who in coat sub-
lime
Laughed loud, drank deep,
made merry,
The heroes of the golden time,
Of famous Tom and Jerry.
Once more we see Bob Logic's
“specs,
And Tom so curly-hatted,
The wondrous shawls thatswathed
their neeks,
So terribly cravatted.
We see them at the masquerade,
With all its fun and fury,
The visits to the Op'ra paid,
And Green-room of Old Drury.
And now shall Almack's come
once more,
With all its tapers gleaming,
The highborn dames who took the
00r,
Mid Stars and Georges dream-
Ing.
Shall we ºt Almack's “sport a
toe,
High destiny fulfilling,
As that old song said lon #.
Through mazes of quadrilling.
“The grave Lord Keeper led the
brawls,”
Unless the story false is;
Will GLADSTONE, at these public
8,
Lead LANGTRY down the
waltzes P
Will SELBoRNE twirl and pirou-
ette
A veritable Shaker,
And BRIGHTonWednesdays forget
That he was born a Quaker
An age of Plutocrats and prigs,
We may perchance laugh
louder
But wit methinks went out with
wigs, -
And epigram with powder.
You can’t bring back old times
to-day,
Though some folks have a bias
For standing, as the Classics say,
Within “antiquas vias /?”
BIG STORIES FOR LITTLE HUMANITARIANS,
“Be always kind to animals wherever you may bel”—Elderly Lady.
No. I.-JOSEPH AND THE JELLY-FISH.
Joseph was wanderin
along the shore at Dover, and he saw a
poor helpless Jelly-fish that had been left by the tile on the sand.
-º-, -
His first impulse was to
shovel it up with his spade
and cast it into the sea:
his second thought was to
touch it :#. (Many
children would not have
been so bold, but Joseph
knew his Tract for the
Time by heart, and was a
brave § He patted it,
and stroked it with the
greatest reverence, and he
found it icy cold. Joseph
shed tears as he said,
“Ha! No doubt this poor
Jelly-fish has been out all night in the cold, and the wet, without
eyen a great-coat, or an umbrella, or a pair of goloshes, while I was
sleeping in a nice warm bed, after a bountiful tº. and a quarrel
with my nurse!”. He tenderly raised the Jelly-fish in his spade,
placed it, in his little wooden pail, covered it carefully with sea-
weed, and took it home. He knew there was not a moment to be
lost, so, placing it in a large basin, he determined to give it a warm
bath. He lifted the kettle from the º fire, and poured its
contents on his patient. To his horror the Je y-fish vanished alto-
gether and a savoury odour pervaded the nursery!
. At this moment Admiral SINBAD, Joseph's º: came in, and
inquired what was £; on. He smiled, as he listened to his son's
simple story. Suddenly his eyes sparkled, and Fº his hands on
the boy's sunny curls, he said, “Joseph, my lad, you have done
well. Your kindness has not been thrown away. Though, you
have sacrificed the Jelly-fish, you have probably made one of the
eatest, gastronomic discoveries of the age 1” And, if ever, you
e with the Admiral, and have some of his famous Jelly-fish Soup,
you will come to the conclusion that the grateful father did not over-
rate the discovery of his little son.

REMARKABLE ROMANCES,
By a Rambler.
No. I.--THE MARTYR,
HE was a long-legged youth, with a costly walkingstick in his
hand, and a large white flower in his button-hole, and he sat next
to me in a front stall at the Frivolity Theatre. Ever and anon he
sighed and groaned with such fervour that he completely distracted
my attention from the polished humour of the three-act Burlesque-
Drama (so different from the old head-over-heels-in-and-out-of-my-
lady's-chamber Extravaganza), which was being performed. It was
after he had uttered one subdued waii of more than womanly
tenderness that my heart fairly yearned towards him, and I made
bold to address him as to the cause of his woe. At first he either
did not hear or did not heed me, but when I was half way through
the fourth time of asking, he turned his eyeglass plaintively towards
mº, and murmured, “Don’t mind me, I am a miserable martyr.”
“Curiosity is often the handmaid of pity,” says the late lamented
writer, WAGGLETHORPE of West Drayton, and so I proceeded to
inquire in what way and from what cause, he was suffering P He
pointed silently to the programme with his finger, and I read,
“ Unprecedented Success. 2000th night of the sparkling farcical
play, ' The Fairy with the Golden Socks; or, the Good Young Girl
who Dyed.’”
A convulsive shudder shot through my neighbour's frame as he
read these words.
“There,” he whispered hoarsely, “is my fate.”
“How so?” I asked.
“Because,” he whispered Yºlº “I have seen this confounded
trash two thousand times...I was here the first night, and an irre-
sistible impulse has compelled me to return on every evening since.
Don’t º I enjoy myself...I simply loathe the piece. knew
all the dialogue backwards, till it º in gag, which I can
repeat with equal ease. I can imitate all the low comédians; I can
sing all the songs; I can execute all the danges. In short, Mr.
GLADSTONE is not more versed in the mysteries of a Budget than am
I in the ways of this burlesque. And yet it is slowly killing me.”
The single diamond, which confined his snowy shirtfront heaved
with emotion, and small pieces of quill fell from the toothpick which
he clutched nervously between his teeth. -
“Do you see,” he continued hoarsely, “do you see that angelic
being on the Prompt side, in apple-green tights and a man's collar?
She has doomed me. She is the fatal Circe who lures me to this
theatre. You must know, Old Chappie,” he added, in a more
commonplace and resigned tone of voice, “she has mashed me.”
4 §. heavens !” I cried, “what do you mean?” - -
“The first time I saw her, she sent a glance over the footlights in
my direction. That glance, Sir, has cost me over a thousand pounds'
worth of stalls, and rather more than double that amountin bouquets,
while three West End jewellers have enlarged their premises since
I dealt with them, and a French bon-bon manufacturer talks of
retiring from business. I tell you that if this piece is not taken off
I shall be ruined, and probably quit this world in a manner incom-
patible with my birth and education.” -
Here he gave a deep sigh, like the east wind soughing in a pine
wood, just as the performers on the stage were executing a dance of
išić at the termination of their labours.
“My duties are not yet over,” cried my new-found acquaintance.
“Come, and you shall see!”
He plunged recklessly through the spectators, heeding little the
agonised and often opprobrious cries with which his progress was
fººt. and I followed as best I could in his wake. I came up to
im, round, a corner, where he was standing in front of a dimly
lighted portal of modest dimensions. Around him was a crowd, for
the most part, composed of beings arrayed like, unto the Martyr.
There was no talking in their midst; Melancholy seemed to have
marked them for her own; and by the light of an adjacent gas-lamp
I could see that a relentless scowl was fixed upon their fair young
brows, while the determination set upon their lips was not generally
concealed by hirsute adornments. A slight movement was presently

e form of a lady with her features closely veiled, passed swiftly
by us and entered a brougham standing by the pavement. -
| Home!” said a woman's voice, a door banged, and the vehicle
rolled away. Clutching hold of my arm, the Martyr reeled into a
neighbouring house of refreshment, and called for a glass of brandy
diluted with soda-water.
“Did you see that P” he asked abruptly, almost fiercely, after he
had drained the goblet.
44 jºint seem very pleased to see you,” I observed—by way of
sympathy. -
...Pleased to see me!” he echoed loudly, nay, almost howled.
“Why, great heavens, man, I never spoke to her in my life.”
I gazed on the speaker for some few seconds, pressed my fingers to
m; urning brow, and then rushed fººth forth into the night.
he fate of that man overpowered me. think, of him more in
sorrow than in anger. The burlesque drama is still running.
Crystal Palace Electrical Exhibition.
THE Daily News says that “JoBNSON AND PHILLIPs show centi-

“Good gracious!”, exclaimed Mrs. RAMsboTHAM, when this was
read aloud to her. “Fancy an Electric Centipedel Why, we shall
be having Electric Blackbeetles next | I dare say that was one of
'em I saw the other day in the hall, for the shock it gave me I never
shall forget. I hope none of my nephews will turn out Electric
Boys, or they don’t come here for their holidays. I’ll never eat
another Mushroom. Read on, my dear.”
Supply
THOUGH the Session, as far as it has gone, has been productive
of nothing but pot and kettle discussions, and the prospect of any
beneficial and necessary legislation is as remote as ever, the first
signs of “Supply” are beginning to show themselves. Govern;
ment may be paralysed, but taxation, is never, prostrate. In most
trades it has been found highly undesirable to pay for work in
advance, but legislation and government are exempt from the ordi-
nary laws of business. If “Supply” were deferred till August the
country might get some value for its money;-perhaps?

MR. GREENHORN’S EXPERIENCES.
THE SARCASTIC AUCTIONEER,
. I HAVE just met with a curious case that seems to indicate a change
in the habits or system of the above highly respectable and conscien-
tious class of Gentlemen.
..I dropped in lately to a sale of “Important Works of Art,” as the
bills described them to be, and found a very small audience assem-
bled, who were listening with most provoking calmness to the biting
sarcasms of, a much-excited Auctioneer, who, having apparently
failed to induce those present to bid, { the ordinary persuasions of
his professional brethren, was trying the effect of the novel system
above alluded to. .
For instance, a neighbour having offered three guineas for a rather
large Landscape, which I thought possessed some considerable merit,
I ventured to iá three and a half, when, to my great astonishment,
I was immediately assailed with a series of most ironical suggestions
from the Auctioneer. -
He asked, me, to the great amusement of the rest of the small
audience, whether, leaving out of question altogether the yalue of
the beautiful work of Art now before me, and scarcely hoping that
I would give some slight consideration to the presume j of the
handsome frame, I would favour him with a bid for about the value
ºf the glass 1, “Would not three and a half guineas,” he continued,
be a rather low price to give for the Picture if it were only for the
#. ºft putting it up in my garden as a cock-shy for my
children?” Shouts of laughter from the audience followed this
remarkable suggestion,
Providence has been kind to me in many respects, and I have no
children, and I am not quite certain that I thoroughly understand
the exact nature of a cockshy.
But, be that as it may, surely this is a strange way in which to be
treated for the simple offence of bidding three and a half guineas
for a picture which was eventually knocked down for fiye. . .
I ventured once more, after allowing myself sufficient time to
recover my usual equanimity, to again follow the lead of a neigh-
bour, and bid three guineas for a little picture by BoDDINGTON,
when the Auctioneer burst out, again, and said,he thought that,
with another such sale, and with just such another lot of similar
lively bidders, he should quietly go home and commit suicide!
Surely this was a somewhat unnecessarily strong threat, , but,
strange to say, instead of exciting in others, as of course it did in
me, feelings &# heartfelt sorrow for the poor man, the announcement
was received with a shout of derisive laughter!
Could they have doubted his sincerity ?
Be this as it may, I carried off my treasure, and am quite satisfied
with my bargain; the only drawback to mythorough enjoyment of
its beauty being a º fear lest I may inadvertently have been
the innocent cause of the death of an amiable Auctioneer, who may
have fallen a victim to a too sensitive nature.

“I am not a pirate,” gasped the old man,
convulsively: , “I have been their prisoner
for years, and have worn this hateful disguise.
Behold l’’ and so saying, he tore off the
Buccaneer's dress, his long beard, with which
went a pair of spectacles, a false nose, and a
grey wig, and appeared before them in the
costume of an elderly Grandee of Spain.
“My name,” he said proudly, “is Don
BoI.ERO.”
“Hal” exclaimed CACHUCA, every fibre
in her body thrilling with intense excitement.
“In consequence of ºl trouble, I
became a Tabooed Nobleman. For many
years I had to hide my head, as you see,” he
added, pointing to the wig, “and the Pirates
stole me while I was asleep. Disappointed
at not, obtaining a ransom, they made me
their slave, may more, their buffoon, for in
the evening they compelled me to dance to
amuse them. Fortunately, when I was
young, I was an accom lished dancer—”
“You were ! ” sobbed CACHUCA.
“Yes,” he said, as turning a pirouette and
standing on one pointed toe, with his left leg
in the air, he gracefully extended his hands
to the weeping girl, “yes, you inherit the
talent. You are CACHUCA, the dancer—”
“And you?” inquired HARRY, eagerly.
“And I ?—I am her Grand Pal’’
“I thought my Grand, Pa. was executed
long ago,” said CACHUCA, simply. Then they
embraced.
“She is nobly born, then P” asked HARRY,
ly.
*śhe is,” replied Don BoleRo. “Her
father was my son, whose mother did honour
to a long line of Spanish Springós Hun-hy-
unos; her mother was of the great Fandango
family, and her uncle was Don CLIQUO DI
CASTAGNETTo.”
“And I am nameless!” sighed HARRY.
But there was no time for mournful thoughts,
as the Pirates were already on their track
and in the offing appeared another vessel
of the same build as that which they were
now launching.
Don BoI.ERo now introduced them to the
other captives, who having been his com-
panions in misery were eager to serve, as
their crew. They were a Tiller, who had
been kidnapped while he was ploughing the
ocean; a Painter, who was strongly attached
to the ship when the Pirates captured it; and
a small British Ensign, made prisoner in an
engagement.
than ten minutes the vessel was quite at sea.
“What's she doing P' asked HARRY, as
he watched the Pirate Ship through his glass.
“Forging ahead,” replied Don BoI.ERo.
“Another crime !” murmured CACHUCA.
“I’ll bring 'em to,” said JACK, who had
just loaded one of the biggest guns, “I’ll
send 'em a hundred pound note. You fire
the other,” he said, turning to HARRY.
“I’m better with my pistol,” replied
Young HARRY, citing his revolver as an
instance in point.
Boom—bang—bash l
“Hooray!” shouted SAMBo. “Raked her
fore and r! shot away her rudder and all
her masts.”
Young HARRY and JACK had had some ex-
perience as pupils at a boarding school, which
was now of the º: service to them, as
they knew how Pirates could be boarded by
the weak;. so the three lads at once seized
the grappling irons, and knocking all who
attempted to oppose their attack into the
sea, they stood on the deck of the redoubtable
Pitch-Falcon, having first entrusted CACHUCA
and DAISY to the care of Don BoI.ERo, and
the two Ship's Companions fore and aft.
The Pirates drew their swords, the ominous
click of their pistols was heard, and they were
#. all worked with a will, and in less|h

prepared to receive them with their revolvers,
when a lºft authoritative voice cried—

THE COMBAT—THE REVELATION –FEARFUL END
or HO HETo.
IT proceeded from a tall, fierce-looking man,
in a Greek dress. In one hand he carried a
sword, in the other a pistol, and a couple of
the national stikkars were in his girdle. His
eyes were lit up with Greek fire, as he
addressed the crew.
“There shall be no more blood shed than is
necessary,” he said, sternly. “I love CA-
CHUCA.”
“So do I!” retorted HARRY.
“We will fight for her. If you conquer me,
this ship, with everything in it, is yours. If
I conquer you—”
“I accept the terms,” cried HARRY ; “but
first, who are you?”
“I am HoHETo, the last of the Haz
Pirates. My first-lieutenant, ToM DAPPER-
MEIBoMENos, will swear the men to obey you
should I fall. They know the nature of an
oath.”
They did: the nature of their oath need not
here be recorded : enough that they did swear.
CACHUCA and DAIsy, on the other vessel,
heard and shuddered.
Then the struggle for life and mastery
commenced.
First they fired their pistols with so excel-
lent an aim that the decks of both vessels
were cleared as if by magic.
Then they drew their swords and daggers.
One, two, three, four—over !
One, two, three, four—under!
The sparks flew about.
HoHETo drew back, and made one tremen-
dous lunge at HARRY, who at that instant
was fortunately carried away by excitement
to some distance out of the Pirate's reach.
Immediately returning, HARRY saw the
Pirate change colour, but, not to be taken in
by a faint, he rolled his shirt-sleeve up to his
shoulder, to give himself more ease in strik-
ing, and, as he took up his sword-carriage
reparatory to driving the weapon home,
of ETo gasped, fell back, shrieking, as he
pointed to HARRY's arm—
“Those marks –an ‘H’

.."Yes, yes!” cried HARRY, stooping over
1In,
“I am–I am your Wicked Uncle. Your
father was the Earl of HARF-AND-HARFORD.
He married the #. I loved. To be revenged,
I stole you out of your little cradle on wheels,
—your draught Bass-inet—and left you by the
roadside. Then, as there were warrants out
against me, I joined the Rivolitionary
Greeks, and pronounced for the Haz Pirates.”
“But my father—my mother—”
“Alas! your mother, the Countess of HARF-
AND-HARFORD, fell a victim to drains; and
}. father stood too long at the bar of the
ouse; — when somebody came up to him
after some hours he was found there flat, and
within a quarter of an hour he was quite
dead.”
“Then I am—”
“You are the Earl of HARF-AND-HARFoRD,
Marquis of FROTH, Knight of MALTA,
Owner of mines of Quartz, lands from Beeritz
to Beersheba, your coronet set in early purls
with the ancient motto of the family round
and a coro-
it, “ Homo sum, nihil aluminium, me
pewter,’ . . . . . the papers are in the locker
—bless you!”
“Oh, Uncle, you’re not going to leave us,”
cried HARRY.
“Yes, tell it. . to my old companions... the
Marines,” gasped his Uncle, faintly. “My
hours are numbered: from one up to twelve.
I can’t go beyond twelve.” Then with a sigh,
he added, “I have lived fast: I am dying as
I j; very—very—fast.”
Once more he turned towards HARRY.
“Farewell!” he gasped, “forgive your
Wicked Uncle—and—remember to bury him
as becomes one of the Harf-and-Harfords.”
“We will get ou the best bier that :*.
can procure,” sobbed HARRY, “and it sh
be carried by four stout porters.”
His Uncle pressed his hand.
Suddenly the sky darkened—there was a
roar as of a volcano—the sea rose in a huge
spiral cone. . . .
- * * + º
When they recovered themselves, HARRY,
CACHUCA, and the others, found themselves
safe on their own vessel. The Pitch-Falcon
and her crew had disappeared for ever !
The Wicked Uncle had gone up in the
water-spout, and had been dashed down to
the depths of the sea.
The crew, unable to swim, sank to rise no
more, the last fiercely shouting their well-
known motto, “Sink and die /*
Such was the end of HoHETo and the Haz
Pirates.
CHAP. VIII,
DISPOSING OF ALL HEROES AND HERoines.
A BITTER tempestuous night: “A sort of
night,” as Parson BYE, as he sat by his fire-
side, said to himself, “when one wouldn't
even turn one's toes out.” So he kept them
in the hot water in which, during the greater
part of his life, he had mostly found himself.
A knock at the door A knockſ
“Yes,” cried a fresh young voice, which
he instantly recognised,—“a knock and a
ring ; ” and so saying, HARRY, wearing an
Earl's coronet, accompanied by his blushin
betrothed CACHUCA, knelt before the go
old man, holding up the wedding ring.
“Bless you, my children l’’ exclaimed
Parson BYE, quite taken aback. He was
taken aback so far as to return to that night
when HARRY borrowed the fifty pounds.
“Here is the sum twice told,” said HARRY,
as Don BoleRo stepped forward and pre-
sented a purse to the astonished ecclesiastic.
“Now then I marry us!” cried HARRY
and CACHUCA together.
“By all means,” replied Parson BYE, joy-
fully. “No Fees' " Then he paused. “Are
you licensed to be married on the pre-
mises P’’
“I am the Earl of HARF-AND-HARFoRD,”
replied HARRY, proudly. “And am entitled
to all the prerogatives of the Licensed
Wittlers.”
“Then you know the sign?” faltered the
Clergyman.
HARRY gave him a peculiar tap.
“That’s it !” exclaimed Parson BYE,
gleefully. “You arº, indeed, the Earl of
HARF-AND-HARFoRD.’

ENGLISH NIHILISTS.
THE English Nihilist is a much more cautious creature than his
Russian prototype. The Russian works with dynamite and other
explosive material, and comes out boldly as a self-evident assassin,
but the English Nihilist skulks behind a brick wall or underneath a
drain-pipe, and uses nothing more criminally destructive than the
forces of Nature.
The Russian Nihilist may or may not be a mechanic, but the
English Nihilist is always a plumber or a builder. He lays his
I.º.º. without prejudice or favoritism in the “eligible man-
sion,” or the “bijou residence,”—in the “rustic retreat,” or the
“rus in urbe dwelling-house.” He is not too proud to work destrug-
tion in a hovel, but he is seen at his best when he is engaged in
constructing a palace. He followed the Prince of WALEs to York-
shire, some ten ¥. ago, and nearly killed him in the hospitable
but unhealthy “Lodge" of a popular Peer; and after this he tried
all he could to make old Marlborough House a fever-den.
His latest triumph has been at Bagshot Heath, in the mansion
lately occupied by the Duke and Duchess of CoNNAught. With
thirty ºr forty thousand pounds to spend in porticos and stucco, he
planned and constructed the drainage system with the most perverse
ingenuity. Wherever there was a hidden pipe, he nearly always
e it communicate with filth; and not content with the ordinary
methods in use for º; a household, he put on a special pipe to
carry sewer-gas into the body of the dwelling. Having nearly killed
the Duchess of CoNNAUGHT at a time when she innocently thought
she was breathing the pure air of the country, and certainly required
it, he . shields himself in the well-worn armour of brutal trade
stupidity. While his Russian brother is hanged or goes to Siberia
for his crimes, the English Nihilist would probably seek for damages
in a Court of Ław for defamation of haraºtº

LONGEVITY FOR YOUNG LADIES.
THE Corset sans Arétes. This newly in-
vented article of *. derives its name
from a similitude to the sardines of the same
name. It is a boneless corset, newly de-
signed and invented by students of Girton
and Newnham; ladies of course whose
studies have rendered them duly conversant
with anatomy and physiology—sciences
applied in its construction.
ilst affording all requisite support to
the frame, the Corset sans Arétes behaves
as such in not compressing the ribs and
contracting the waist, thus in not arresting
the circulation in vital organs which those
bones inclose, and into which º ought
not to be squeezed, but often are by ordi-
nary corsets. The adoption of the boneless
corset will therefore, by preventing the
fatal effects which the common corset too
commonly produces, tend to preserve the
person of the wearer from premature reduc-
tion to that mere bony framework of which
the form and arrangement constitute the
foundation of the Figure. On view at the
Hygeienic Wearing Apparel Exhibition,
vendis ms, Mortimer Street; where
also may be inspected various other novel-
ties in female costume, calculated to admit
of health and comfort, and avert a great
and distressing variety of sufferings and
ailments.
An elegant costume is, in the language
illiners, sometimes styled a .#.
In its somewhat different way the Boneless
Corset must, as a sweet thing in corsets,
be allowed to be a bon-bon to Beauty.

9ff, as the CoRINTHIAN remarked, to join his Sally in a corner, for
it was evident that here was the flask part of mankind.
It was certainly an omnium-gatherum, for one or two Swells had

ToM pointed out the starched-up LADY, the consequential FAIR ONE,
the upstart MRS., the professional BEAUTY, the turn-up nose DEMURE
CREATURE, and other birds enticed by GILLETT, and fondly supposed
to be SoCIETY. But 'twas all a sham, and no more like the AL-
MACK's of other days than the Sluicery or the Whistling Shop of
the East-Enders. True, there were one or two great MEN, come
there out of Curiosity, the eloquent GLADSTONE, the philosophic
PUNCH, and others well-known in LIFE IN LONDON, to stare at the
strangely arrayed divinities who had got in, as Toº said, with a
GoLDEN KEY.
“It appears, my dear JERRY,” said the CoRINTHIAN, “that any-
one can enter here who chooses to ‘sport his blunt'—that is, to pay,

attempt to revive ALMACK's had nothing to do with the GREAT or
little world in the Metropolis, and that the tout ensemble was rowdy
in the extreme. As the CoRINTHIAN said, knee-breeches, even when
worn by a QUAKER, do not make a man the arbiter of LIFE IN LONDON.
Little Bumbledom and Big Bumbledom.
THE St. Pancras Westry have refused to give the Metropolitan
Board of Works as much money as they have asked for, on the
ound that they are opposed to the Income-Tax in Advance Screw
invented by RoßERT Lowe, and are not in love with the extravagant
system adopted by the London School Board. We quite agree with
Little Bumbledom in this instance. For the way they hit all round,
they ought to be called St. Spankus.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extra ACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Mowday Night, March 20.-Mr. RAIKEs offering a few remarks
on the Clöture resolution. Not a cheerful man Mr. RAIKEs, but I'm
told by several Members that at one time he was the gayest of the
fº Spirits always ºf
inſof zestand humour and cheerful
views of the universe.
“And what º to brin
about this remarkable change?”
asked, looking with renewed interest
at the Right Hon. Gentleman with
his whitening hair, his leaden-hued
face, his drooping knees, his lack-
lustre eyes, to all of which his
mºlalºboly voice is so well attuned.
“Why,” says Sir WILFRID, “he
was Chairman of Committees for
several Sessions with the Major roar-
ing at him every night, Mr. BiggaR
hooting him, and Mr. PARNELL
eternally prodding him. Could see
him waste away night after night.
Blood faded from his cheeks; hair
growing grey, and gradually steal-
ing over him the air of depression
which he now disseminates through
the House. Lyon PLAYFAIR will go
the same way unless we get these
Rules through. Beginning to show a strange pallor already. RAIKEs
thinks he ought to have a little longer experience of it in the old
style. Not fair to him, he says, that his successor should be relieved,
and thrive amid progress and business.”
Most interesting man, Sir WILFRID. Hardly anything you can
ask him about that he does not know. Often find he knows things
that nobody else has heard of Wish he was a little more sociable.
Can't bear to see him drinking his toasts in water.
Later in the evening when Members getting a little sleepy, H.
Fowler fairly waked us up. There’s a voice of which a Borough
may well be proud! Base notes really charming; used with great
effect to increase the natural horror of anything Conservative. H. F.

glances at the Opposition below the Gangway. A stout fist shaken

WHELPTON's Hair-Wash for Inward Application. A great loss to
the Stage when Mr. Fowler turned his attention to Politics. In

useful, and opportunities for groans expressive of withering scorn

excitement. Hobbies crowded. House full. Signs of agitation
everywhere. Thought BRADEAUgH had got in, and sworn terribly,
like our army in Flanders, Sir CHARLEs. Forster running about in
state of excitement.
“What's the matter, Sir CHARLEs? Found your hat?”
“No,” said the Hon. Baronet, #: his forehead; “Seaswan,
Mumblemouth, and 0 yste attie way Bill.”
“Ha!” I said, “I’m glad of that.” Neverwise, especially for a
new Member, to look surprised. At the same time determined to
get to know about it. Met WHITLEY with a look of stern deter-
mination banishing the accustomed smile.
º What'. this Oysterswan, Mumsea, and Mouthbles Bill?” I
asked.
“Don’t know,” he replied. “Haven't the slightest idea; but am
determined to vote for Second Reading if I lose my seat. You come

“Why, it's a Bill, -

must vote against it.” Things getting alittle mixed, and not clearer
after further investigation. One man tells me it’s a Bill to bring
Qysters to Mumbles. Another says it's to remove Mumbles from
the Oysters. Mr. CAINE says he has heard it’s to provide a new
set of teeth for Oystermouth; but then, as he says, Oysters don't
want teeth, and if they did, the demand should be resisted in the
interest of the consumer. Fancy having a set of false teeth rattle

here she saw a poor
decrepit Oyster securely
tied in the Barber's chair.
The features of the poor
creature were almost obscured by lather, and the Barber was just
approaching his victim with an enormous razor.
“Oh! oh Mr. BLOPECK,” said OLIVIA, “Stop, pray stop! What
are }% going to do?”
“I’m just going to take off Mr. OystER's beard in a twinkling,
that’s what I’m arter, Miss,” answered the Barber.
“Qh pray, pray, Mr. BLOPECK, spare him He has never wronged
you, Mr. BLOPEck, I will #. you a whole penny if you will let me
take him away.” The Barber paused and shook his head, and
flourished his razor. “Stay, stay !” shouted QLIVIA, “I will give
you my silver sixpence to spare the poor thing!”
The Barber, who was but human after all, and very thirsty, was
not proof against the little maid's entreaties, backed with a silver
sixpence. The Oyster was released, and OLIVIA took him, home,
washed the soapsuds off, brushed his beard, and anointed it with
Macassar Oil, e, Oyster long lived as one of the most valued
retainers, in OLIVIA's family, and his patriarchal grey beard was
revered throughout the county. He never forgot OLIVIA, and when
the little lady grew up and was married, he prepared a pleasant little
surprise for her. He invited a couple of ...}.} who danced

BOW WOW ; OR, SALISBURY AND THE SPECTRES.
THE following letter has been received by the Secretary of the
Hole-cum-Corner Constitutional Club, in reply to Resolutions passed
at an important and influential meeting (of, ten, all told) held in
the upper room of the “Pig and Palladium,” Hole-cum-Corner, to
inaugurate the first Session of the Club. [The letter, is being hand-
somely framed, and will henceforth hang over the chimney-piece
beneath the stuffed dodo and racked blunderbusses, at all Clu
meetings.]
20, Arlington Street, March 16th, 1882.
SIR,--I am much obliged to you for your letter of the 10th inst;
I am infinitely gratified to receive the enclosed Resolutions, passed
by so imposing a *::: of patriots and constitutionalists in the
important hamlet of Hole-cum-Corner. . At a crisis—a desperate
and agonising crisis—when the Majority in the House of Commons
are madly and mischievously wrong, it is comfort to know that the
majority at the “Pig and Palladium” are sanely and soundly right.
The ãº: as its cloven foot on the neck of our Religion,
and its unhallowed, hand at the throat of our Liberty! ... An impe-
rious and dictatorial Minister, having thrown the dust of verbosity
in the eyes of the People, is now endeavouring to clap the pitch-
laster of enforced silence upon the lips of Parliament. ith a
§º country and a § House, that evil man hopes to
work his wicked will, which plainly is to haul down, the British
Flag, root up the British Qak, cut the claws of the British Lion,
lay loggats with the British Crown and nine-pins with the British
nstitution; in fact, to robus at once of our Freedom and all our
favourite Figures of Speech. Without the former, Creation would
be one huge Radical Caucus; without the latter, the Hole-cum-
Corner patriots—and, myself—would be deprived of arms and of
arguments. It is only in such “Resolutions” as yours–I receive
heaps of them every morning—and in such horror-teeming replies
as mine—I indite piles of them eyery evening—that there lies hope
of ºf the spectral prospect of the rule of Anarchy and Atheism
which,--thanks to the great Atheistic Anarch GLADSTONE,-looms
in the immediate future. I am yours faithfully,
SALISBURY.

At four went for a stroll down Piccadilly, and saw everybody I
knew. Met JoHNNIE, who had had a good night with the Jews, and
paid me the pony he owed me. Good fellow, JoHNNIE. Saw BABY
in a hansom, and she saw me, worse luck! and stopped., Just off to
the Čiub to wait in the hail for jACK, and then to speak her mind
about his marriage before everybody. Evidently JACK's day. Qut:
Swore that JACK had left the Club before I got to town, and had
gone to the Gun Club. She wouldn't have it, and said that we men
always backed each other up in any lies when girls were concerned.
Do we ? Thought we generally crabbed each other's form.
Discovered that while I was talking to BABY, the carriage pulled
#. in front of the cab was my eldest sister's, with her husband.
They’ll tell the old man, and there’ll be no money from home for
this child. Felt cheap at this, so went up Bond Street and had a
B. and S. at TALL’s. They give you more brandy there than at any
other shop in London—which is #. I suppose this made me order
a bangle, rather º too, pearls and diamonds, to be sent down to
the stage-door of the Joyous. Took a stall there for to-night.

Bath full. Nobody seems to have been to bed for three nights. Old

in luck, so shall have a go there myself to-night. Send out a man
to wire for leave from Adjutant's Drill to-morrow. Found ToM and
CoRKY being shampooed. Asked me to dinner. ToM had dined with
me three days ago, so accepted. Had a cup of tea, and felt very ill
afterwards. My constitution is not what it was, and I musn't
tamper with it in this manner.
Went back to Club. Read telegrams. Mal-de-Mer has won a

took her to the Orchid to supper. She didn't wear my bangle,
and had got on a big emerald necklace. I hate emeralds. Who
gaye them to her ? neral row. She cried, as usual. Somehow
this made me remember that I had never had an answer to my

Would I see her home?, Did so. Fight the whole way in the cab,

Through this got to Waterloo in time to see the cold-meat train

some ass spilt a glass of Kümmel over it, and I couldn't read them

NEW ZOOPRAXISCOPIC VIEWS OF AN EMINENT ACTOR IN ACTION.
(By Our Own Zoëprairiscopist.)
NOTES FROM GATCHINA.
(Communicated by the Proprietors of the “Boston Intruder.”)
March 1,–There are few places which the Boston Intruder does
not reach; and fewer still into which their Correspondents do not
penetrate. Got in here by pretending to be a Surveyor, commis-
sioned to report on a projected railway, for which an American firm
of Contractors would buy up any quantity of land at proprietors'
own estimate. Liberal commission all round. Gentlemen in attend:
ance seemed to see it. Arrived quite safely, though in a state of
considerable alarm. But no one fires at me; my food is not
poisoned, and I have not once been blown up. -
March 2–The Emperor is monarch of all I survey. . With the
exception of Colonel TchokIMOFF, Commander of the Garrison,Count
FALUTIN, High Chamberlain, and Dr. Nosoff, Sworn Analytical
Chemist, there is no one at Gatchina his rule to dispute.
jiſarº. 3.-Colonel Tchokimoff has just come in to say that at
about a hundred yards' distance from the Park-gates a suspicious-
looking stranger has been observed. Troops called out. Recon-
noitering party sent forward. -
Afternoon.-The suspicious-looking stranger. Correspondent, of
the New York Personal, anxious to interview His Majesty. Not if
I know it. Possibly Nihilist in disguise. Er nihilo nihil fit." Out
of a Nihilist nothing can be made. He would say anything. So
would the 8.i. of the New York Personal.
March 4.—Got up º went to the top of the palace, and had a
good look through the telescope. All serene ! Took, in the garden,
what, if I were not in an autocratic country, I should call, a con-
stitutional. The gardeners were digging. Thought it might be a
mine. But Count FALUTIN said it was a trench for celery. Qne of
the under-gardeners had something like gunpowder in his hand; and
kept scattering it about the ground just as we were passing. Very
unpleasant; though on being analysed by Dr. Nosoff, it turned out
to be only onion-seed. So, at least, Nósofº says. Gunpowder or
not, that so-called onion-seed gave me a shock. -
March 4.—Rognons sautés to-day at lunch. Hope there will be
nothing else sauté as long as I stay. Don't like the word, and told
FALUTIN so. Wish the Emperor would discharge him. font iike
that word either—it suggests pistols. At dinner saw Bombes glacées
written at the end of the menu. The very idea of such a thing
took my appetite away. Couldn't dine a mite. - - - -
March 5-TCHOKIroFF explained to me, that FALUTIN, if dis-
missed, would join the Nihilists, and set the place on fire before
leaving. I wonder whether, if I stayed here some time, I could
learn to look upon Gatchina as my home. Of course there is no place
like it. It might get monotonous, though, after a time. My poor
friend, CHARLEs KENNEY, used to say, that he liked “IIome,
Sweet Home” with variations; and perhaps he was right.
March 6,-Asked FALUTIN whether it was difficult to carry...on
government of country from place of retreat; Said he should like
to know how it could be carried on from anywhere else! At Peters-
burgh lots of people waiting to be presented. This General calling
out for the order of St. Anne, that one for the cross of St. George.
Emperor would have to sign ukases and fº. to appoint Com-
missions, to entertain, and get shot at. Much better here.
March 7.-Colonel TchokIMoFF, returning from Petersburgh
brings news of Nihilist meeting at which value of lies, spies, an
revolvers, as instruments of political progress, discussed. Resolu-
tion to abandon assassination of individuals, and try agrarian in-
surrection, and the corruption of the masses, adopted, by large
majority. ' How does TchoKIMOFF know? Is he one of them?
March 8.-FALUTIN has just made a very interesting discovery.
One of the scullery-maids is a Panslave. -
March 9.--Why should not His Majesty retire from business?
The empire is still a going, concern, and he might hand it over to
a. º: Call it “The Russian Monarchy (Limited).” The
Grand Duke CoNSTANTINE could finance it, and GLADSTONE might be
asked to join the direction; Rothsch ILD, unfortunately, would not
touch it. That business about the Jews has estranged him.
March 10.-Walked in the park, and met a beggar who had
somehow got in. What culpable neglect on TchoKIMoFF's part |
FALUTIN gave signal, and TchoKIMOFF, hurrying out at the head of
his battalion, turned both the enemy's flanks, and hemmed him in.
In the course of the interrogatory to which he was subjected, beggar
was asked whether he was a Nihilist. Said he thought he must tº:
for he had nothing in his pocket. The Emperor might be glad to
give him a crown!
PANIC-MONGERING.
WHEN the public, mind is, unduly excited upon the subject of
“Fires in Theatres,” the excitement is not likely to be allayed by
describing a wooden shed in a tea-garden at St. Petersburgh, as a
“Bouffe Theatre,” and a second-class music-hall at Marseilles as a
“Theatre” or a “Crystal Palace,” because they were destroyed by
fire. Nor is it altogether wise or necessary that two fussy but well-
meaning provincial Members of Parliament, who represent places,
the whole º of which could be put into Covent Garden or
Drury Lane Theatres, should career round the town on a fire-engine,
on a Saturday night, and visit certain theatres and music-halls in
company with half-a-dozen amateur firemen.
TIMES HAVE CHANGED.
A BoID peasantry—a country's pride
If now destroyed, need never be supplied.
THE Poet WILDE will probably leave America on the arrival of the
Proser Jumbo. Two suc º personages could not possibly exist
in the same Continent at the same time. , The Yankees, who have
enjoyed, the Oscarity of OsCAR, will subsequently revel in the
Jumbosity of Jumbo.

A STORY OF A SEAMSTRESS.
THERE's nothing in life like an English Spring,
When it colours the joys of our holiday time
With a cowslip crown and a primrose ring,
A tuneful song and a perfect rhyme.
A moment more, and the world’s away .
To the countless joys that the country yields;
How few will listen, when free to play, ...
To a cry that's uttered from Coldbath Fields !
A woman just married, at twenty-one,
To a brute who could work but who skulked instead,
Was awakened to starve by the morning sun,
Having slept on a bundle of rags for bed.,
There wasn't a stick and there wasn't a chair
To rest her young body when sewing-ah well,
When men are on bicycles, living in air,
Young women are dying in Clerkenwell.
This sewer of seams hadn't tasted a crust
For three days past—but her tears had drunk—
So she cried, in her agony, ‘‘Perish I must 1”
As down on her tottering knees she sunk.
Then she asked herself, in a helpless way,
Would it be very wrong—well, to loan a relief
By detaining some property, just for a day?

thief 1?”
* + + f -
So the Law took away six long weeks of the life'
Of the girl who had starved—but had stolen as well;
And they punished this poor little down-trodden wife
With the comfort of food and the warmth of a cell.
From nine in the morning till eight in the night
She had tried to be honest at home, pretty lass;
But she failed. Oh, Morality, witness the sight
Of this newest recruit to the criminal class |
The carpenter spouse of this felon—his wife—
Will continue to sulk, as such reprobates can.
He will preach of injustice, the bane of his life;
On my honour, I’d sooner be woman than man!
'Tis only a simple romance of despair,
But #. men who can fight and the women who feel
Should reflect, as they flourish in holiday air,
'Tis moral to starve, but it’s wicked to steal!

THE NEW CODE.
(On the Thames Embankment.)
. At the weekly meeting of the School Board, an animated discus-
sion took place respecting the New Code; and our Reporter states,
that he was positively bewildered by the infinite variety of opinions
expressed upon the subject. With regard to one of the points of
controversy, he has forwarded to us the following note:-
Miss BLUERopy called attention to what she emphatically described
as a fatal defect in the New Code. There was no provision for the
compulsory teaching of the higher branches of education. In this
; of progress and enlightenment, we ought not to be content to
follow in the footsteps of our grandfathers and grandmothers. We
ought to lead—and we must lead.
An Hon. Member asked where the Lady wanted to go.
Miss Bluebody. I want to fulfil our duty to the people by teaching
them the great scientific truths which have now superseded the old
worn-out theories of ignorant and barbarous ages. I would refer
the Hon. Member for example, to the great and glorious theory of
Evolution which has now been adopted by the entire scientific world
of Europe and America, without a dissenting voice.
Mrs. Busybody. Not so, Miss BLUEBODY, there are many dissenting
voices.
Miss Bluebody. I spoke of the scientific world, Mrs. BusyBoDY.
Mrs. Busybody. To which you would insinuate I do not belong.
Well, Miss BLUEBoDY is quite entitled to believe that she is descended
from a tadpole. She may be quite right for anything that I know or
care.
A Reverend Gentleman here rose to Order. Whether Miss BLUE-
Bopy was or was not descended from a tadpole, was not a question
before the Board. If it had been intended to discuss it, due notice
ought to have been given. These were great questions involving
#. ºple, and ought not to be dealt with in this haphazard
1nd 01 Way.
Another Hon. Member, whose name our Reporter did not ascertain,
said, the Evolution theory was a piece of pure humbug, and he pro-
tested against any such rubbish being taught in the Board Schools.
Upon this, there was something very like a general uproar, about
a dozen Members shouting at once at the top of their voices, and
before order was restored, Miss BLUEBODY rose from her seat, and
walked majestically out of the room.
The Chairman then reminded the Board that the discussion
respecting Evolution and tadpoles was altogether irregular, and that
there was a good day's work before the Board. The Finance Com-
mittee then proposed a variety of estimates, and the perfect
unanimity with which the money of the Ratepayers was squandered,
afforded a striking contrast to the previous discussions of the Board.
There were new Turkey carpets ordered for the Shufflebury
Training Ship, and also a library for the use of the Stokers. A box
was ordered at the forthcoming WAGNER Operas for the use of the
musical Teachers. It was only to cost £20 anight, and was reckoned
a great bargain. Then there were a few hundred thousands voted
for new schools, birch rods, increased salaries, &c., without a whisper
of dissent. The Y. of money acted like magic on the perturbed
spirits, male and female, who a little before seemed to be drifting
into actual collision. The proceedings became so very tame, that
our Reporter informs us he actually fell asleep.
THE PRIZE-FIGHT IN A CHAPEL.—Only the co-irreligionists of
Mr. BRADLAUGH or M. PAUL BERT would see the fitness of things in
a place of Christian worship falling into the hands of some pro-
fessors of the philosophy of “Mill.”

REMARKABLE ROMANCES.
(By a Rambler.)
No. II.--THE SECRET OF SUCCESS,
THERE was no matter of question but that he was a Genius. His
name was RASSELAS RICHELIEU DE RoNCEsvaLLEs, and he wore his
head shaved with a pig-tail after the Celestial or Chinese fashion.
Moreover, he affected green boots with
yellow tips, smoked Manilla cigars be-
tween his soup and fish at dinner, and so
distorted the Queen's English, that the
Treasury consulted the Law Officers of
the Crown as to whether he should not
be subjected to a Public Prosecution.
But the chiefest of all his many virtues,
was the reverence with which he had
inspired his disciples for that vegetable
of culinary importance which is called
Onion... In this highly-scented bulb, as
exemplified by its long-lasting fragrance,
he had detected a symbol of Everlasting
Endurance, and it was in the character
of its Bard or Seer that he became famous
as the Founder of the Onionic Cult. His
appearance, indeed, was held to be typical
ºp his Faith. His shorn head, with its
dependent pigtail, was known mystically
to represent the legume of his choice, while the colour of his boots in
no less occult fas ion, typified the savoury horticultural product’s
combined hues, which range from the rich ochre of the Spanish, to
the delicate green of the Spring.
The Social progress, or rather ascension, of De RoncesvaLLEs
was indeed one of which any follower of the Muses might well be
proud. Any father would have been proud of such an offspring,
any cousin, fifteen times removed would have claimed him as a
blood relation. Duchesses sighed for his sonnets (which came not),
Marchionesses scented their handkerchiefs with no other perfume
than Triple Ertrait de l’Oignon, and the fruiterers of Covent Garden
daily reviled his name as they surveyed the piles of pine-apples and
peaches which remained unsold by reason of his influence; though
their maledictions were more than counterbalanced º the humble
benediction of the Freen grocering hucksterer, and the hearty, bless-
ing of the “string”-selling costermonger. When questioned as to
the secret of his success, Dr. RoNCEsvailEs would invariably reply to
the Peer as to the Interviewer of the Press, “I am the Living Lesson
of the Infallibility of the Five Mystic Letters.” He would say no
more and no less. It was in vain for the Good and Great to ask his
meaning, the confidential agents of Prince BISMARCK, though
specially despatched to this country, returned to Berlin, sadder, but
not wiser men; and Mr. GEORGE Lewis and the Public Prosecutor
were reported to have shed tears over their inability to discover, the
slightest clue to the import of the Bard's speech. Certain there
were, of course, who derided him, the Philistines, the Goths, the
Iconoclasts, the Huns, and other Outer Barbarians. But at these
the Seer and his disciples smole. -
It was about the time that men seriously debated whether a statue
of the Bard should not be placed upon one of the vacant pedestals in
Trafalgar Square, when the price of Collodion rose seventy-five per
cent., owing to the demand for his photographs, and when it was
rumoured that the Commander-in-Chief and the First Lord of the
Admiralty had decided upon the imperative necessity for re-intro:
ducing pigtails in the Army and Navy, that the Poet was delivered
of his #: work, after Messrs CHRISTIE AND MANson had knocked
down the right of publication at a fabulous figure to, a specially
organised Limited Liability Company. The book was splendidly got
up. It was bound in white velvet and vellum, it was lettered in
#tiºn and gold, and it was printed from silver-faced type; while
the rough edges of its leaves were taken as an antithesis to the polish
of the Author's mind. It contained only a dedication, and a poem,
but it ran through one hundred and fifty-six editions in four days.

A WORD FOR THE
DOCTORS.
It is assuredly high time that
research was protected, when
medical men engaged in investi-
gating a case of poisoning are
obliged to H.". their in-
quiries in France, in order to
bring a criminal to justice in
England. No wonder, then, see-
in how foolish and fanatical
people are raving about subjects
they do not understand, that the
medi profession, under the
Presidency of Sir WILLIAM Jºn-
NER, are taking steps to “bring
the legitimate influence of the
medical profession more effec-
tively to bear on the promotion
of those exact researches in phy-
siology, pathology, and thera-
peutics which are essential, to
sound progress in the healing
art.” Wivisection conducted with
anaesthetics has saved thousands
of lives, and yet a prominent
female opponent of the practice,
who goes about º it,
ignores that indubitable fact
as a savant upon whom she
3d pointed out to her, she
wore ostrich feathers taken from
the living bird, and a bird of
paradise which must have been
skinned alive, and thus while she
rayed against all experiments to
aid Science, she had no objection
to the infliction of cruelty for
her personal adornment.

LITERARY IMPUDENCE.
It is high time that someone
with a voice of authority should
tell Novelists that their claims to
all-round copyright are impudent
and ridiculous. Their position is
strictly defined by the laws of
England, and the laws of England
are simply perfect. Those who
think otherwise are Atheists and
Fenians. A Novelist should not
only write as many novels as
possible, but should write them
in a more dramatic form, so as to
give adapters far less trouble.
No one but those in the trade
can imagine the difficulty an
adapter has to encounter in copy-
ing the dialogue, incidents,
characters, and names of the
Novelist's creation. ; Novels that
long ago haye been through the
fierce fire of critical wrath, are
just the books that an adapter is
justified in laying his hands upon.
He does a public service by
dragging them from their obscu-
rity, and subjecting them to the
urifying influence of the LoRD
XHAMBERLAIN and thePlº oers,
and a repetition o Verse
criticism. He is fairly entitled
to all the praise he gets for
attempting a difficult task, and
the Novelist ought to be thankful
for any publicity obtained for
his work, even if it is largely
leavened with abuse and misre-
presentation.
IN return for the privilege of
having the refusal of the Lau-
reate's new play, Mr. IRVING will
robably give him his acceptance.

The dedication was, “To the Beneficent Influence of the Five Mystic
Letters; ” the poem, which (owing to the magnificent size of the
printing) filled ninety-eight pages, was nevertheless in but two
cºuplets. called "Thé Öion: A Harmony of scents.” The con-
cluding lines of this remarkable poem were:—
“0 ! Subtle Essence of the field and valley,
Of lonely moorland, and of wind swept fell,

The greatest curse which can afflict the human mind is Envy. The

alwa e bought an article at two and elevenpence three farthings,
W: Waited till he got his change out of three shillings. Like
9* he knew that every man has his price, and he resolved to

*: the mºrning of the first of April, when the sale of human
* notwithstanding the Anti-Slavery Laws is annually effected,
the Bard had scarcely finished his frugal matutinal meal of yellow
chartreuse, green ginger and caviare, when BRADDS was announced
and ushered into his presence... BRADDs, who had bought a new
white waistcoat (with sixpence discount, cash) for, the occasion, was
unusually exci In his right hand he clutched a twelve-to-the-
sheet cheque book. “The secret’s mine for twenty-five thousand
ounds,” he said, without more ado, “the secret of the Five Letters
}. twenty-five thousand pounds.” And he sighed deeply.
“Guineas,” corrected the Poet, “I am above the aureous influence
of Lucre, but I am the Apostle of Accuracy.”
“So be it—guineas,” muttered BRADDs, tearing a slip from his
cheque-book and filling it in, while the Seeker after the Truth
simultaneously pencilled something on the unused side of a trades-
man's bill. A dead silence occurred, during which an observer, had
he been present, would assuredly have heard the muffled thud of a
pin upon the £ersian .capºt. The voice of the Poet broke the
monotony of the silence. “Uncrossed ' " he ejaculated.
“It is,” replied BRADDs, handing him the document to which he
had just appended his signature. “And now for the secret of the
Five Mystic Letters.” w
The Seer pressed the paper Fº which he had written into the
eager fingers of BRADDs. It simply bore the inscription “CHEEK,”
in a quaint scholarly hand.
That same night it was rumoured that the Seer of the Onionic
Cult had retired from business in order to espouse the lovely but
ºil. daughter of a Celtic Nobleman. Concurrently the abrupt
eparture of BRADDs the Millionnaire, for a tour in Central Africa,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF
PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
GETTING GLADSTONE'S COLLAR UP.
Mowda P. Night, March 27.—Mr. WALPoLE in his seat at question
time, , Doesn't often come now. Unlucky he should have been here
to-night; his feelings having been sufficiently worked upon during
the course of a long and honourable career. If he’d only been ten
minutes later all would have been well. Came in just in time to
hear Mr. SExton put a question: It seems there is a prisoner in
Kilkenny Gaol, to whom a blood-thirsty Government have refused
the use of a harmonium. Arroyºgº of Iºn ºn.
fronted with the question as to whether the Executive had declined
to allow this Gentleman the use of a harmonium, fenced with it in
customary Crown-lawyer style. Could not answer without notice.
That's all very well, but in the meantime this Nobleman languishes
in prison uncomforted by the strains of the harmonium.
“No one can suspect me of associating with the .* lot,”
Mr. WALPoLE said to me, with the tears streaming adown his face;
“but to think that a Gentleman sent to gaol, having asked for a
harmonium, should be refused It’s worse than anything done in
Naples during the reign of BOMBA.”
“Perhaps,” I said, wishing to comfort him, “they couldn't get it
in at the door, and the windows are, I’m told, always incon-
veniently narrow in gaols.”
“Then,” said Mr. WALPole, with honest indignation, and a fresh
tear, “they should have built another prison, or should have taken
care to put a Gentleman of musical tastes in a gaol where the door-
way was wide enough to take in an ordinary harmonium.”
“Peradventure,” I remarked, “the other Gentlemen in prison
might not like a harmonium going. I have heard of Fº who
objected to a piano ºf. as they brutally call it, in the
next room, and I have seen the harmless organ-grinder driven
from the door-step by the hard-hearted householder.”
“Oh!” said Mr. WALPole, weeping afresh, “that's the diffi-
culty of the Government. I am glad I am out of it. , Can't please
9ne party without offending another: What’s one man's harmonium
is another man's abomination. Full of difficulty, full of difficulty;
yet I cannot refuse the natural tear when I º these cases ſo
Governmental tyranny.”
Wish the estimable old Gentleman would look a little nearer home,
and waste some of his sympathy on us. Here's the Clöture Barrel-
Organ been jºins all night, and we are promised another night
of it on Thursday.
Thursday Night.—House crowded a
ment. Thought at first it was the
Two-Necks, and Mulligatawn
in, and every sign of excite-
Scalloped-Oyster, Swan-with-
- Hºlyº, ill in another stage.
Begin to be sorry hadn't looked it up. But shall vote one way or
the other this time. Shall follow DILLwyn's lead. He seems to
know more about it than any other man, and the other night observed
highly judicious course. Moved an Amendment, and then voted
against it. More cannot be expected from a Borough Member.
Turns out not to be Stewed-Oyster, Black-Swan, and Mumble-
Bee Railway. Our old friend the Clöture on again. Going to settle
it now, I :* Been at it long enough. Here's Easter Recess
close at hand. Nice thing to get it all over before we start afresh after
the holidays. When we come back shall have a chance of gettin
to real business. Lyon PLAY FAIR (who, by the way, does look paler
says, we’ve hardly touched the fringe of the question. Seems theré
are fifty Amendments before we get through this first Resolution,
and there are eleven more Resolutions. Sir GEORGE ELLIOT, who
can do any sum in his head, reckons that at present rate of progress
shall have reached the third Rule on 12th of August. Sir GEORGE
looking very well, but complains of cramped space.
“Egypt’s the place for me, Toby,” he says. “I like a place
where you can cock your legs upon the bench, and no questions
asked. In Egypt you can take your dinner lying down if you like ;
but here have to sit bolt upright, as if you were being photographed.
The other night got on a back bench, where I thought I could not
catch the SPEAKER's eye if I wanted. Spread myself out; just be-
ginning to think Parliamentary life not, so bad after all, when up
comes Sergeant-at-Arms. Says this isn't manners. ‘No, but it’s
comfort,” says I. But had to sit up.”
Nice genial man, Sir GEORGE. JosłPH GILLIS quite taken to him.
Pleasant to see them together. J. G. instructing him in politics,
and fancies he'll make something of him.
“Worst of him is,” JoEx B. says, “wheneyer I talk of his noble
espousal of our cause, at the Election, and his pledge about the
º: he changes the subject, or sees someone on other side who
e must speak to.” -
Pretty speech from Mr. BRIGHT, and short too, which is something
in these days. Almost gentle with the Conservatives, but came
down heavy on the Land-Leaguers, to their pained indignation.
Have observed before that your greatest sticklers for Order are to be
found amongst the Land-Leaguers. Also, here are the most sensi-
tive minds who shrink from the use of harsh language. Mr. QALIAN
positively gets red in the façe, and his words tumble over each other
in generous haste, when he hears any imputation on the honesty of
purpose, M." of motive, or general decorum of Land-League
party. an of exquisitely, refined mind is PHILIP. Also of
polished manners. Shrinks instinctively not only from anything
that is absolutely rude or vulgar, but from speech calculated to hurt
the feelings of the least-considered. Member. ... Land-Leaguers
shocked at Mr. BRIGHT's language to-night. Mr. SExton retires for
four hours, to º impromptu reply. When he comes back goes
hot for BRIGHT. Mr. CALLAN and Mr. HEALY must be absent, else
we should hear protests against these insinuations and imputations
on the part of their colleague.
Friday Morning.—Division at last. Elderly Members who were
here even before Mr. NEwBEGATE, brought gently in by the new
Ambulance Corps. Members asleep waked up. Mr. WARTON's
snuff-box in great request. , Members being half asleep, terribly
afraid of going into wrong lobby. Wideawake Members with an
eye to the scarcity of cabs, get into the lobbies, as soon as the ques;
tion is put. Mr. BIGGAR bustles out between Colonel STANLEY and
Sir WALTER BARTTELOT. - - ----- -
“Landlordism and No-rent,” says Sir WILFRID LAwson, comin
in from the Bar, where he has had a “pick-me-up,” composed o
the refreshing lemon and the invigorating spring water.
Mr. HEALY rubs shoulders with Sir STAFFORD NORTHCOTE, and
Mr. CALLAN leads the way for Mr. CHRISTQPHER SYREs. A constant
stream from either doorway; a rising hubbub of voices; a succes-
sion of Members breaking through the throng, bringing in the latest
figures polled; search for Lord RICHARD GRosvenor, who has been

After a moment's pause, and a rapid survey of Members
below the Gangway, he selects the Lord Mayor, of
Dublin, walks up to him, publicly deposits the hat in his
charge, chivalrously refuses to take a ticket, and rejoins
the Tellers. They pause a moment whilst the Liberals
make weak imitation of a Tory cheer; then advance, a
thin streak of black, up the floor of the House with the
excited throng on either side. Lord RICHARD announces
that the Opposition Amendment has been negatived by
318 votes against 279.

Friday Night.—Wish the LoRD Advocate had been
allowed to finish his speech on herring-brands. . Never
heard a Lord Advocate's opinion on herring-brands. No
one can say when we shall have another opportunity.

the Lord Advocate which indicates that he would have
been able to add something striking to the stock of human

GYE-FUL NEWS,
THE programme of the Opera Season for 1882 promises some good things.
We are to have PATTI, ALBANI, and LUCCA, who has been too long absent,
WALLERIA and Fusch-MADIER, with new singers named OLGA BERGHI, and
STAHL, and the ever-welcome TREBELLI. For tenors we have MIERzwinsky
º: a delightful name to have all to yourself), FRAPOLI, VERGNET, and
ESTELLIER, while there is a strong list of Baritones and Basses. The repertoire
at Covent Garden is to be strengthened by the production of BöIto's Mefistofele
and Bizet's pretty opera Carmen, which is so full of dramatic Bizet-ness. A
new opera, Pelleda, will be given for Madame PATTI's benefit, and L'Africaine
for Madame LUCCA, MAssen ET's Herodiade is also promised, and Mr. Gye
has had the libretto thoroughly re-written, and the objectionable features
expunged,” a process which we imagine must have been by no means an easy one.
Still more news comes to us concerning the Opera. There is to be only one
house open. Messrs. GYE and MAPLEson have buried the hatchet,t and formed
a Limited Company, with His “All Serene’’ Highness Count GLEich EN and the
Earl of LATHoxt among the Directors. Mr. ERNEST GYE is Managing Director
here, and Mr. MAPLEson goes to America, where he has had large experience.
The two Operas used to cut each other's throats like Italian bandits. One
Italian Opera at Covent Garden ought to be a great—no, more, a Gye-gantic
success.
* We are glad to hear this—as we dislike “objectionable features” on the stage—
especially in an Opera.-E.D.

of a paragraph in the Times of Thursday last: “Good gracious!” exclaime
her excellent Aunt, Mrs. RAMsboTHAM, “that's very sudden! Why, he
must have been *} since yesterday evening, or, of course, we should
have seen it in the bill,—Romeo by Sir HENRY IRVING. Well, I am glad, for
really, LAvvy dear, I ão think he deserves it.” " Oh, Aunt, dear!” exclaimed
Miss LAYINIA, “this was a dinner to Sir HENRYT, IRVING, K.C.M.G., ºn the occa-
sion of his departure as Governor of British Guiana,” “Ah! Well, it doesn't
sound nice, my dear,” returned Mrs. RAM, “and I’m glad Mr. IRVING is going
to stay at the Lyceum. Now read something else.”

THE MILLENNIUM IN MONACO.
(From the Tales of a Traveller.)
I Found Monte Carlo virtuous. The dreadful Casino had been
converted into a Working Man's *. Institute, and the croupiers
once the miserable employés of a degrading establishment, had ound
new places as Superintendents of Coffee-Palaces. Far from being
shunned by the virtuous residents of the Riviera, the little Princi-
pality was in their high good favour. . As I arrived, the beautiful
walks on the terraces were thronged with the pupils of an English
Sunday-School, who had come in a pleasure-van from Mentone to
enjoy their annual treat on the loveliest shore of the Mediterranean.
Bun-shops were seen in all directions, and many of the resident
merchants had amassed, so I was told, large fortunes by the sale of
muffins, crumpets, and ginger-beer. Altogether, the place was in a
most satisfactory condition. .
On the second day of my visit I was honoured with an interview
by the reigning Prince. The heir of the GRIMALDIs received me
most graciously when he discovered that I was a member of the
Society for the Perpetual Abolition of Gambling Propensities. He
had long white hair, and a most benevolent expression characterised
features which were at once handsome and intellectual. He told me
that he heartily rejoiced in the suppression of the vice which had
once rendered the home of his ancestors a hotbed of misery and
dissipation.
“Ah! I shudder at the recollection 1" he murmured, with a sigh.
Rºuge et,ºgir and trente et quarante were so silly, so wicked.”
'' Out,”,Ireplied in the purest Parisian, to show his Highness that
although he, spoke in excellent English, I was a perfect master of
the French tongue—“Oui, but votre Altesse seems, in fact, to be
very comfortable.”
“It is indeed 50,” observed the Prince, glancing at the si of
wealth that met the eye on every side. “I have discovered that it
is within the resources of civilisation to make a good income without
descending to gambling-house keeping. The representatives of the
late M. BLANC have disappeared, but I still enjoy my little per-
º,
“Yes?” I answered, interrogatively.
“For instance,” he continued, “I have my Monte Carlo Stock
Exchange. We have the same rules as those used in Capel Court.
Nothing can be more respectable. The brokers pay me a slight com:
mission upon their transactions, and at the end of the year I find
§ account with them has realised a nice little sum to swell my
balance at the banker's.”
“Commerce is a noble thing, your Highness.
great prestige to her mercantile ramifications.”
“Quite so,” the Prince acquiesced. “And then we have started
a copy of Tattersall's. Really, you might almost fancy yourself in
Knightsbridge in the grand salon.”
“To sport our great country owes its love of pluck and fair play,”
England owes her
I cried with enthusiasm.
“You are indeed right,” responded his Highness, “and as I am
paid a trifling sum upon every entry in the º of the Book-
makers, I do not, do so badly. Then we have Clubs, where only
Whist is permitted.”
“Ah, a splendid game,” I observed, “a good whist-player must
be a man of wonderful attainments.”
“Certainly,” smilingly .#. his Highness. “And to keep
down the stakes to a reasonable amount, I charge a small per-centage
upon all gains and losses.” -
“An excellent regulation. And so, Prince, it is really the fact
that you do not permit *#. any form or shape?”
“My dear Sir,” replied His Highness, solemnly, “I have taken
}. great country as my model, and I permit no more gambling in
onte Carlo, than is countenanced in London!” I was satisfied.
Later in the day I assisted at a performance of an amateur pantomime
in which the Prince himself took a part. True to the instinct of his
ancestor, the great GRIMALDI, His º: appeared as clown.
“I thought you would like it,” said the fº old man subsequentl
as he took his leave of me. "The English are never better pleas
than when witnessing—a farcel ”

(Addressed to the First Commissioner of Works by an
Indignant Tory.)
“The removal of the Wellington Arch and Statue is the only

So the Park’s to be altered—not Hyde Park, I mean—
But the one, being brown, that we know as the “Green,”

He was iron—is now—here's a plan for the Duke!
My suggestion is this, take the Duke as he's now,
Fix him hat, horse and all on white Dover's cliff-brow.
He'll protect us, for should that new Tunnel be made,
Mark my words, 'twill be giving invaders free trade.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MODERN LIFE IN LONDON ; OR,
“TOM AND JERRY 2’ BACK AGAIN.
CBIAPTER I.
It was becoming slow in THE SHADEs, as CoRINTHIAN ToM
observed to his Coz JERRY HAWTHORN, Esq., and he proposed a
visit to the UPPER WoRLD, a lounge through the town, a saunter
through the scenes of their old sprees, and, in fact, a visit once more
to the ne plus ultra of “LIFE IN LONDON.” JERRY eagerly assented,
for the Conversation of the IMMORTALs was not equal to that of the
Metropolitan Heroes of Literary Renown, and the Swan of Avon's
habit of reciting his own plays at all times and seasons, made JERRY
long for the Peep o' day boys, while the Oxon IAN had suffered so
from Hamlet, declaimed after the un-sw Irving manner of a famous
actor, that he did not scruple to declare that the BARD was a
LITERARY CRIPPLE. ToM's meridian, as we know, was the BEAU
Monde, and he longed to be “at it again,” while his airy manner
made him a great favourite with KING PLUTO. Indeed, his
sable Majesty had been heard to declare, “’pon honour,” that were
he not Monarch of the Shades, he would be CoRINTHIANTOM. Thus
it was that the CoRINTHIAN had no difficulty in obtaining leave of
absence for himself and JERRY from the Tartarean Tyrant, and the
Oxonian could have accompanied them too, but he shook his specs
and laughingly declined. “No, my dear ToM,” said Logic, “I have
been in the Fields of Temptation before, and prefer the Elysian fields,
so I will remain here: but I have a son, a gay spark, now “on the
tour,” who, they say, is very like his father, a real “Bit of Blood.”
Seek him out, for you will find the truth of Tempora Mutantur, and
he will prevent you being blown up at “Point. Nonplus.” “We
shall indeed be glad to meet young Bob,” said the CoRINTHIAN,
“and if, as I suspect, he belongs to the Tribe of Fops, he will
be very useful to us in our en passant view of the new LIFE IN
LONDON. So accompany me, JERRY, or we shall be too late for the
sº Coach, which is to start immediately from “THE SHADEs.”
Old Bob Logic saw our heroes off, and they promised to “tip him
the wink” as to what went on in the upper world. As the coach
whirled them along, the CoRINTHIAN called JERRY's attention to
Charon the Coachee, who appeared to be a queer card.” “He was,”
said ToM, however," a first-rate whip; ” and as he tooled along he
laughed at Lucy, sighed at SARAH, ogled OLIVIA, and captivated
CHARLOTTE like one of the “Good Old School.”. They changed
horses and coaches on the borders of the Elysian Fields, and having
tipped Old Coachee, went away at a spanking Fº in the direction
of the Metropolis. ToM and JERRY enjoyed their ride, though, as
ToM remarked, he would not give much for the “prads” at TAT-
TERSALL's, while the freedom of some of their companions made the
CoRINTHIAN state his opinion that the coves were evidently on the
“look-out,” and they had better beware of flue-fakers. . When a
modest tavern, wº was now called an HoTEL, invited them to
alight, Old Boniface came out, and the CoRINTHIAN immediately
ordered dinner and the fine old wines of the House. Mine Host
replied, that he had orders from Mr. Robert LoGIC of the Albany to
have “lunch ready,” and he offered anchory sandwiches and a
magnum of MUMM's Champagne. “How is this, Old , Boni-
face f" cried the CoRINTHIAN. But the Tavern–Keeper said that
was the wine His Royal Highness the PRINCE of WALEs drank, and
the TIP-ToP fashionables would have no other; so ToM and JERRY
artook of it, the CoRINTHIAN saying to his Coz that Boniface knew
is business, and that if MASTER BOB's manners were as good as his
wine, it was evident he was a “gay party,” and a worthy son of his
comical SIRE.
Thus the CoRINTHIAN and his Coz. JERRY HAwTHoRN journeyed
to town, and at certain stages ToM §. upon JERRY to
“handle the ribbons,” which the Young #. did with great dex-
terity, not forgetting, in true Coachee fashion, to bestow a wink on
the fascinating fair ones on the road. The CoBINTHIAN too had
some conversation with one of the “Knowing Ones” near him, as to
what LoNDoN was now like, what was to be “seen there” to get rid
of ennui, for, as he said, “a little MIRTH in this MELANcholy LIFE is
a good thing.” “Well,” said the stranger, who was rather a flashy
Cove, “we have had a little fighting lately, though the Bobbies are
down on us precious hard, still we manage to get up a MILL now and
then.” “Do you hear that, JERRY P” said ToM, “it is evident we
have returned to the Metropolis at an opportune time; you remember
our visit to CRIBB. THE CHAMPION, and the set-to at Mr. JACKson's
rooms, I shall be curious to see who now patronises the Noble
Art of Self-Defence! “It is evident,” said the CoRINTHIAN, “that
cich scenes are awaiting us, though the primest touches of LIFE IN
LoNDoN may not be here. But times have changed, as the Oxon IAN
would remark, and we must be on the qui vive. At all events, my
dear JERRY, we shall observe character and nature, and, as Boniface
remarked, MUMM’s the word.”
Barren Honour.

“WHERE Do You GET You R HATs, OLD MAN ?”
“At Scott's. Is THERE ANothah FELLAH !”
“MOUNT ROYAL.”
MISS BRADDoN's new “Mount” is one of her old
hobbies re-painted and the spots changed. It is another
variation on the original theme which suggested Joshua
Haggard 's Daughter, Just as I Am, and Barbara.
The ascent of Mount Royal is not in the least
§. once commenced, you are bound to go on.
Old landmarks may be recognised from new points of
view, and the interest carries you to the end, which in
this case is a somewhat disappointing finish. By the
way, d propos of Barbara, in the memorable controversy
about The Squire, the Dramatist, while admitting having
read, Far from the Madding Crowd between his note-
making and his play-writing, denied in toto his obligation
to the Novelist. Now, it is seldom that a novelist is ac-
cused of borrowing from a dramatist, but every playgoer
old, enough to remember La Dame de St. Tropez—of
which an English version was played at the St. James's,
with Miss HERBERT and Mr. ALFRED WIGAN in the chief
parts-must, on reading Barbara, have been struck by
the striking resemblance between the two most impor-
tant situations in the noveland the above-mentioned play.
In both, the old lover with a knowledge of medicine
turns up, and discovers that the illness of the husband
is due to poison; in both, the innocent wife is supposed
to be the poisoner; and in both, the real poisoner is
discovered by a mirrored reflection. The two first of
these situations also occur in a five-volume novel by M.
XAVIER DE Montfern, written long after La Dame
de St. Tropez, but whether before or after Barbara,
is not here to the point. No one, as far as we know,
has ever charged Miss BRADDoN or M. DE Montfºrn
with plagiarism, and yet the coincidences are, with
one strong exception in the Hardy-Pinero case, as re-
markable as those in The Squire and The Madding
Crowd.
Whatever argument would acquit the French and
English novelist, would, so far, acquit the dramatist.
That’s all: but to return for a last word to Mount
Royal; the more we have of Miss BRADDoN, and the
less of Miss RHoDA DENDRon and WEEDER the better,
in our opinion—which is not a Podsnappish one—for
all novel-readers, old and young.

REMARKABLE ROMANCES.
(By a Rambler.)
No. III.-THE IRISH TUNNEL.
It had become evident to all men that a submarine tunnel, con-
necting the island of Great Britain with that of Ireland, was not
merely a luxury but a necessity of everyday international life.
When I say “all men,” I refer to the dwellers on this side of St.
George's Channel. In the Green Isle
the scheme evoked, on the contrary,
violent opposition; and this was per-
haps not much to be marvelled at,
considering that the Home-Rule Par-
liament had just passed three Bills,
one Boycotting the LoRD-LIEUTENANT
and his successors for ever, a second
authorising every tenant-farmer to pay
no wages to his labourers, and a third
instituting a Land Act for England,
Scotland, an ales. It was almost
universaily felt that the completion of
the Tunnel would re-introduce British
brandy, civil taxation, military #.
pression, and a thousand other ills
under which the land of PARNELL and
potatoes had groaned in days gone by.
- The new scheme had, however, one
É. ºp. in the person of that great patriot, The O'FLIGH.
ossessed of boundless wealth, mainly derived from the fabrication
of “potheen,” and returned at the General Election for ten boroughs
and five counties, The O'FLIGH was justly regarded as one of the
chiefest props of the commonweal. Ámid the shooting of landlords,
the maiming of cattle, and the annihilation of process-servers, The
O'FLigh had ever maintained a dignified, statesmanlike, sympathetic,
and Hibernian attitude. He it was who compared his native country
to “the Upas-tree which had withered Saxon oppression;' his was
the hand which tore the first brick from the walls of Kilmainham
when an enthusiastic mobrazed that degraded prison to the ground
and from him—it was no secret—came the funds which provided
ribbon for the Ribbonmen throughout the length and breadth of the
land. His advocacy of the Channel enterprise excited some surprise.
Not a few men on receipt of the news whispered “Ochone l’ and not
a few women sighed “Alannah!” but these exclamations did not by
any means turn him from his purpose. The only information he
vouchsafed to inquirers was, “I am determined to put an end to this
state of things.” It was a dark, enigmatical expression, and when
the PRESIDENT of the UNITED STATEs cabled to inquire its meaning,
the O'FLIGH merely replied, “A nod is as good as a wink.” The rest
of the saying he omitted, for though rich he was also economical.
When the share-list came out it appeared that he had subscribed
far more than two-thirds of the capital. As he practically controlled
the subterranean passage, he was consequently chosen Chairman of
the Company... The intelligence entirely did away with any previous
*g. on the part of his countrymen. One universal shout of
“Begorra !” rose up into the blue heavens, and the shooting of six
landlords, together with the general illumination of Dundalk, Port-
arlington, and the Giant's Causeway, testified to the joy of the Celt.
It was felt that something great would be developed. Politicians
ſº hinted that when the Tunnel was completed there would be
ear and trembling among the pampered menials of Windsor and
Marlborough House, sportsmen prophesied that the Curragh Races
would be transferred to Epsom, and the Derby be run at Rathcoole,
and among the fair sex there were long vituperative and interesting
debates as to the balls and parties which The O'FLIGH would give at
Buckingham Palace, the Mansion House, and the Tower of London.
The constant and continued absences of the great man in the
English Metropolis, were reasonably taken as affording more than
colourable foundation to these surmises. The report of his many
interviews with the “Sassenach” Premier, was construed into his
natural desire “to beard the effete old lion in his Augean den”—at
least, so a powerful national organ put it.
Meantime, the submarine works went on apace, and it was noticed
with considerable glee, that, by a simple mechanical process, the
tunnel could be j from the Irish end at five minutes' notice,
thus precluding any danger from “invasion.” . In fact, such confi-
dence was established, that the Excelsior Irishmen (as the most
pronounced party called themselves) made no secret of severing all
connection with England when the Channel Tunnel should be com-
É. and of proclaiming The O'FLIGH as the President of a new-
orn Republic. The proposed recipient of this honour, howeyer
only smiled the smile of the utterly incomprehensible. This excited
no comment, for such was his custom.
At last everything was ready—the last bore had bored, the last
drill had drilled, and a spacious subway ran from Kingston to Holy-
head. Then it was that the mighty mind of The O'FLIGH asserted
itself. “Only those who are foremost in the cause of Erin's
advance,” he announced by advertisement, placard, and dbill,
“shall first tread the newly-acquired territory. I need scarcely say
I refer to the Excelsior Irishmen. They, as pioneers of their
country's might, shall have the proud privilege of leading the Van of
our Conquering Army.” Here was a scoff to the Saxon abroad, and
a rebuke to the timorous and vacillating at home!
On the day of the opening of the Channel, the disaffected,
the disloyal, and the disunionists, appeared in thousands at the
entrance, and with cries in complete harmony with their opinions,
disappeared down the shaft. The O'FLIGH, like DARIUs, watched
the procession as it passed and greeted him with shouts of congratu-
lation..., “Are, Caesar, morituri te salutant,” he murmured enig-
matically, and many supposed that he was practising himself in the
Celtic Tongue.
Late in the evening there came rumours from those who had gone
in first that a massive iron door closed the English end of the
passage. But this did not prevent the remaining few Excelsiors
from following their brethren. “Any more for the Channel?”
cried The O'FLIGH repeatedly, in the voice of a 'bus-cad. There
was no response. Then he silently turned on the flooding apparatus.
The Irish Channel-Tunnel has never since been used, but the Sister
Isle has been distinguished for its peaceful condition. No one even
hurls brickbats at a constable. e only turbulence has been that
of the sea which separates Liverpool from Dublin, and Dublin from
Cork. Otherwise, harmony and the Sovereign have reigned.
There are those who declare that The O'FLIGH should never have
been created Duke of TIPPERARY, or, indeed, have been invited to
settle the Egyptian Question, which hº did. *
If, when a man has a story to write, he will read letters about the
Channel Tunnel, eat Welsh rare-bits, and fall asleep, he cannot be
blamed by his Editor. Is not this justice all the world over ?
THE SONG OF THE CIVIL ENGINEER.
[The Duke of EDINBURGH said at the dinner of the Institution of Civil
##". that no society so important existed anywhere throughout the
Oriol.
WELL may they sit and banquet, who show the rule of man,
O'er earth and sea, who with the bridge the rolling waters span,
Who tunnel underneath the sea, who climb-like mountaineers,
Who drive the great steam-eagles, the gallant Engineers.
They combat Nature’s forces, and earth, and sea, and air,
Find men to bend them to their will who labour everywhere;
They bring the lightning from the sky to grace our chandeliers,
And plough the furrows of the sea, the able Engineers.
Then here’s a health to ARMSTRONG, and each engineering star,
To FRASER of the Woolwich guns, those mighty babes of war:
They civilise in times of peace, and aid when strife appears,
The Titans of our modern times,<-our Civil Engineers.
A SALWE FOR BURNS.
AT a meeting of the Inverness Town Council, a letter from Lord
ARCHIBALD CAMPBELL, ºff, that Scotland should give a
wedding-present to her “Junior Duke,” Prince, Lºopoºn, created
quite a “scene.” One Gentleman, a Mr. BURNS, declared that Lord
ARCHIBAL.D "had made a fool of himself, already, and had tried to
make a fool of the people of Scotland.” . It is impossible to say
whether Mr. BURNs is a relative of the celebrated “RoREDE BURNs,”
but he might well address the following lines of his great namesake
“To a Gentleman whom he had offended,” to the object of his
anger :-
ge “Mine was the insensate frenzied part,
Ah! why should I such ‘scenes' outlive!
“Scenes' so abhorrent to my heart!
'Tis mine to pity and forgive.”
But as the subject which raised Mr. BURNs's ire was, to quote his
. º 4 # connection with the tartans,” he will probably do nothing
of the sort
JAMEs KELLY got all he deserved for helping in the theft of
Mrs. BESANT's dog. Mr. CoIE, counsel for the defence, sugges
that the prisoner was “only a cat's-paw.” Pretty powerful cat's-
paw to snatch away a St. Bernard mastiff, which was returned to
its owner without a scratch. But it was on Mr. BRADLAUGH’s
information that JAMEs KELLY, who belongs to a family of profes-
sional dog-stealers, was brought to justice. After this there won’t
be a single atheist among the dog-stealers, they'll all yield to
their convictions—as Mr. KELLY has been compelled to do to his—
become confirmed dogmatists, learn the Catechism, and vote against
Mr. BRADLAUGH's admission into Parliament.

Question. Admitting SHAKSPEARE to be the greatest genius the
world has ever seen, and that—
“The flight of Genius is above all rules
Made to guide talent, and to fetter fools,”
what evidence is there to show that, as a practical Dramatist, he was
not up to the requirements of either an eighteenth or nineteenth
century stage or of an audience, A.D. 1882 P

jolly row up-stairs I”
§: has been altered more or less according to the experience of the
anager who catered for the taste and fancy of his public.
Q. at is your opinion of the plot of this play ?
4. The first part excellent, -up to the banishment of Romeo: after
this, it is forced and unnatural.
Q. Explain yourself.
4. With pleasure. Two such desperate lovers, ready to die for
one another, would have been far more eager to live for each other,
and therefore would have eloped. . With the opportunities at her
command, Juliet had only to join her husband at Mantua, and live
with him quietly out of the way till the storm had blown over.
Q. What is your opinion of Romeo?
4. Perhaps, with the exception of Werther, there is no such
contemptible nincompoop in romantic fiction.
Q. Do you think this character can ever find an adequate
representative on the stage 2
4. No. Mr. FoEBEs RoBERTSON, perhaps, went nearest to it by
All our own Wault, or, The Last Resting-place of the Knight-Capulets.
(A Pall Weronese.)
making him as much like a modern effeminate aesthetic young man
as ºil. ; but even then, he was too manly in his combats with
Tybalt and Paris; though had he fought with Mr. IRVINg's vixenish
fury, he would have been as near completing his picture of the ideal
Romeo as it is possible for any but a hopeless lack-a-daisical Grosvenor
Gº, young man to be.
Q. If the representation of this character is so impossible now,
how was it possible in SHAKSPEARE's time P
Don't know : but I suppose it was because Juliet was played
by a boy, and Romeo by another boy, Juliet's tone is far more
masculine than her lover's, and when the part was played by a boy,
this colouring would be brought out into stronger contrast. The
uncritical audience Yº: over the sorrows of a pair of love-sick young
noodles who had lost their hearts and their heads.
Q. What do you think of Mr. IRVING as Romeo £
A., I think that he does his best with a part, which the Author,
“had his own opportunities been brought up to the level of our own
time,”—to quote Mr. IRVING's ewn preface, would never have
chosen for him, in spite of the advantages offered by the “fuller
*:::::::::: of our present stage.”
Q. Do you think the Nurse an estimable person?
A. She is a wicked old
tolerable on the , stage,
until I, witnessed Mrs.
STIRLING's marvellous im-
personation of the cha-
racter. As long as Mrs.
STIRLING can play (ad
multos annos, with all my
heart 1) let no other Nurse
be seen. It is perfect.
She shows us how she is a
mixture of foolish fond-
ness, low cunning, and the
vulgar piety of the Nea-
politan Thief,who, saying
a prayer and picking a
pocket at the same time,
“worships because he
fears, and sins because he
does not love.” Her out-
ward display of devotion
at Juliet's death-bed, her
devout attention to the
Friar, and her way of
woman; but I never saw her made even
mentioning her deceased The “Nurse” at the Lyceum. A Sterling
husband, are things to be Actress.
seen and studied.
Q. Have you any other remarks to make on the º generally *
A. Yes. The Capulets are a very objectionable set, but deci-
dedly true to nature. Old Capulet is the very type of the good-
hearted jolly old Father, who is so sociable and pleasant “before
company,” and such a tyrant and ..º.º. his own family
circle. Mercutio’s speech about Queen Mab, was evidently intro-
duced by SHAKSPEARE in order to induce a good actor to play a
slight part, and, but for the few words he has to say, the part of the
Apothecary might be given to a clever pantomimist like Mr. John
D'AUBAN. The general merits, the artistic taste, and the magnifi-
cence of the present revival at the Lyceum having been already
duly treated of, I have nothing more to say on the subject.

You were counting, I’m sure, the sad hours till our meeting:
Oh, say, ANGELINA dear, was it not so?

THE MAN FOR THE POST.
John BULL loquitur –
WELL, well, here's comfort—and, by Jove' it's needed—
Amidst the chaos of cantankerous cackle,
Here is one man has silently succeeded,
One man who a tough job can stoutly tackle.
O si sic omnes. In my blatant Babel
Business is a lost art—at least it seems so.
All the more honour to the Champion able
Who still can realise my hopes and dreams so.
To serve the State, to sagely shape and plan for it,

No epic hero! Well, I’m getting weary
Of the huge windiness now dubbed heroic:
“Arms and the Man”—and a fiasco dreary,
Too oft repeated, irritate a stoic
uch as I’m grown. And then I'm not quite certain,
Applied to him the name is pure misnomer.
FAwcETT, though seldom “called before the curtain,”
Perhaps in more than one point pairs with HomeR.
Although one sang Achilles and his host,
The other schemed, not sang, the Parcels Post.
º: the large ambition that loves spangles
And warrior fame, might pooh-pooh the projector's,
But I’m inclined to fancy Red-Tape's tangles
Are tougher foes than many Trojan Hectors.
Achilles as Laocoon might have thundered
And thrust tremendously, and }. been throttled.
St., Stephen's spouters long have ought and blundered,
And long, myrising wrath I’ve choked and bottled,
But I am glad to see one silent, strong fellow,
Who emulates the hero sung by Longreſſow.
“Something attempted, something done.” Precisely .
A friend of mine, who much inclined to scoff is,
1)eclares when FAwcETT's plans have ripened nicely,
The World will be a branch of the Post Office.
Let the Wit wag. The World won't find salvation
In parcels or reply-cards, stamps or thriftiness;
Danger there may be in “centralisation,”
But, after all the squabbling, hobbling shiftiness
Of the cantankerous, rancorous jaw-jaw-jaw set,
'Tis a relief to turn to HENRY FAwcett .

DEAR CHARLIE,
I’oPE you'll ascuse me not droppin' a line, as you arst;
Iwos boxed at that blessed Qld Bailey a week up to Saturday larst. .
Oh, don't be alarmed, dear old chummie, I 'aven’t bin run off the straight,
Though I doubt if a week's reglar chokee could be a hunpleasanter fate.
Fact is, I have bin on a Jury. New line for yours truly, dear boy,
And I'oped it might be a rare barney, a thing as a chap could enjoy.
I am nuts upon Criminal Cases, Perlice News, you know, and all that,
And, thinks I, this will be “tuppence coloured,” and spicy as all round my hat.
A fraud, CHARLIE! Flat as be blowed, and five days on it, fancy, old man!
Oh, it giye me the needle, I tell yer. This Trial by Jury’s a plan -
Which the Scribblers crack up to the nines as our Liberties' wotsername. Yus !
We wos slavin' for Freedom, I s'pose; but they'lowed precious little to hus.
I have heard that our great Constitootion has this for its hend and its haim,
To º twelve 'onest men in a box. But that isn't the 'ole of the game.
I’old, if yer fathomed the matter, you'd find this 'ere wish at the bottom,
To make 'em as jolly uneasy as ever they can when they’ve got 'em.
Wyº 're chivied about like young Charities, hordered fust 'ere and then

By the bobbies, and hushers, and wot not, and all with the 'ortiest hair,
As if you wos “Matches” or “Voilets” a-stoppin' the road in a crowd,
And snorted at strong if yer snigger, and “hush”’d if yer sneeze a bit loud.
Sneeze? CHARLIE, the draught down my neck for five 'ours at a stretch was
that strong -
That I shan't want my 'air cut this quarter;-you know I don't wear it too
long.
Lively lot we all looked the next day, with our eyes dim as grandmother's specs,
Our handkerchers all on the wave, and our nuts all askew with stiff necks.
Mother Law is a decent old Mivvy, no doubt, but the i. old 'oles
Where she stows us away, whilst we serve her, ain't worthy of beetles or moles.
Nothink in it, dear boy, I assure you, -no comfort, no
fun, and no pay; -
Twenty minutes is all they allows you for “pecking”
the 'ole of the day,
Jest time for a rush and a “stand-up,” and back to your
box like a shot, -
And for chaps as is “Gents of the Jury”—not pris’ners
—it's landing 'em 'ot.
The old jokers in scarlet and erming who lounge in their
red bedroom-chairs, -
And the cinder-wig'd toffs in alpaca who cackle and give
themselves airs
Are paid for their little bit, CHARLIE, while we has to
waste a 'ole week,
And put up with the cramp and short commons, long
jawings, and everyone's cheek.
A8 to werdicts, oh well, I got mixed; I suppose it was
all quite O.K., -
And the Judge mostly give us the tip, when the parties
'ad all 'ad their say.
But they cobwebbed it up, so sometimes, that I wasn't
quite clear where we’d got to,
And there was one Jew chaplethoff I should like to 'ave

But if we ºre so precious important, Lus Gents of the

MR. PUNCH,
As Chairman of one of the principal Railway
Companies, my dear Sir, let me earnestly protest against
an unkind suggestion that the Directors .P those public-
spirited Societies, are likely to demur, on pecuniary
grounds, to Mr. FAwcETT's proposal of a cheap parcel-
postage.
Even were it possible we could be avaricious enough
not to accept his terms, we could hardly dare refuse.
Well remembering how many proprietors of land and
houses the public good has necessitated us to dispossess at
forced sales, often to the great loss or discomfort of in-
dividuals, we feel very sensibly that Government, in
their turn, might, in case we disagreed with Mr.
FAWCETT's terms, quote our own example to warrant
them in taking over the railways, as they did the tele-
graphs, at a valuation. Indeed, they would perhaps
already have bought us all up but for the knowledge that
we conduct our affairs so very much better, cheaper,
and safer than ever they could.
We regard the joint-stock societies over which we
preside as commercial concerns, if you please; but, first,
as beneficent institutions; and as to the proposed parcel-
post §§§ on our part, pray, my dear Sir, assure
the British Public that no reasonable offer on that of
Mr. FAwcETT will be refused. If, indeed, our abilities
were but equal to our wishes, and you will believeme, we
would willingly not only carry parcels but also convey
passengers free, gratis, for nothing except the thanks of
our grateful fares. It is only as quite a minor considera-
tion that we regard dividends. Otherwise my name
is not GUs HINGTON.

“TRYING ! ”
Street Boy. “'Oor AY 1 'ERE's
OLD JUMBO come BACK AGIN 1."
Mr. SNEERw ELL (Belgravia) suggested it would be a perfectly
fair proceeding, as, at the present time, Westminster was flooded
and o cted, and disgusted with the offscourings and the scum of
the Irish People. (Hear! Hear !)
Mr. MUDD *Whitj District) rose to a pint of Order.
A VoIgE. “Then order a pint, and sit down!” After consider-
able confusion, order was at length restored.
. A Bill to apply the Revenues of the Livery Companies to the reduc-
tion of Rates, and for power to adapt the Halls of the several
Companies as Refuges for the Destitute.
Sir Mungo McTURTLE (Sydenham) thought they might be content
to take the siller and leave the Halls, which were endeared to some
of them by so many tender recollections.
Mr. SLAP BANG (Shoreditch) thought the proposed application was
a very righteous one of Buildings that had been described, with so
much true delicacy by their Chairman of Committees, as Shrines of
Gluttony. (“ Hear! Hear!”)
The Remembrancer said he was almost afraid that he should have
to ask for some assistance. (“Oh! Oh!”). He was of course quite
aware that his illustrious ancestor had said that England expects
every man to do his duty, but the line must be drawn somewhere.
Mr. MUDD (Whitechapel District), said they didn't want no
grumbling. As there was as good fish in the sea as never come out
of it, so there was as good Remembrancers outside the City, as never
come into it. (“Hear ! º
The Remembrancer said he was quite willing to work his fingers
to the bone, and his brain to a similarly soft condition to that at
which the Hon. Member's had evidently arrived, (“Order.”) but
he really must ask for a small extra allowance for Midnight Oil, of
which he consumed a large quantity, and which he found expensive.
Sir ANDREW, Lush (Fins ), remarked, that if the Remem-
brancer would a little Scotch Whuskey instead of his Midnight
Oil, he would find it answer the same purpose at vera much less cost.
eRemembrancer's application was unanimously rejected.
Qn the question of Allowances to Committees, Mr. J. DIDDLER
(Wapping District) said, let them set an example to mankind, and
at the same time show their contempt for the extravagant feasting
of those they had succeeded, who, in that eminently veracious book
that they owed to their learned Chairman of Committees, were said
to have expended no less than £20 a year each in sumptuous banquets
to themselves l—that is, no less than 8s. a week for gorgeous festivi-
ties 1 How could they better do this than by unanimously resolving
never to dine at the public expense, but to be content with a copious
luncheon, and a trifle of £200 a year each for such necessary expenses
as omnibuses and trams ?_(Loud cheers.) .
Sir MUNgo McTURTLE (Sydenham Division) seconded the Motion
with vera much pleasure. He knew of a certain noble Institootion
dedicated to Science and Art, where a vera good luncheon could be
had for a vera little money. (“ Hear! hear !”)
Carried unanimously. - -
A long debate took place on the question of the fitting colour for
the Members’ costume.
Mr. Q. T. FILLIPs (Old Jewry) moved that they keep to the old true
Blue that had been worn by their predecessors for countless genera-
tions, and had borne for ages the Battle and the Breezel (“Hear!”)
Mr. FROTH remarked, that, as he supposed they all intended to be
Friends, he should su º Drab. (A laugh.) .
Mr. Jo, BEGGER j e thought that for various reasons, some of
which he would like to enumerate as he knew they would be particu-
larly disagreeable, but supposed he should be called to Order as
usual if he did, that by far the most a Pºłº, colour for all of
them, was his national colour, Green. { Oh! Oh!”
Sir ANDREw LUSH ventured to hint that if they adopted Blue,
they would save themselves vera conseederable expense, as the
gentlemen they had superseded would doubtless be vera glad to dis-
se of their now useless Robes at a vera conseederable reduction.
“ Hear, hear!”) - -
The further consideration of the matter, like the further consider-
ation of almost every other matter, was postponed, and the Supreme
Council then adjourned to lunch.
MRs. RAMSBOTHAM says her married, sister, has considerably
improved the garden of her new house at Kensington, by introducing
a number of shrubs of the Anonymous, which shrub, Mrs. R. thinks,
is one of the prettiest evergreens in existence.

STEALING A WEDDING MARCH ON 'EM.
THE Divine SARA, now Madame DAMALA—our best wishes for the
happiness of bride and bridegroom—very nearly had her journey
from Naples for nothing; as, though M. DAMALA and herself flew on
Love's wings across Channel (no el) and Continent in order to
be married in England, where they ...; these things better
(ahem 1) than they do in France, yet, according to the account in
last Wº: Morning Post, the happy bridegroom was unaware
that a special licence from His Grace of CANTERBURY was required
before the ceremony could be proceeded with. Fancy a foreigner's
dismay at being told, he must go to, Doctors' Commons! “Why, a
Doctor? She is not ill! I am not ill ! On what commons does he
live P I have seen your Boat-Race, I have heard of your Clapham
Common, your Wandsvort Common l’’. Then, when he comprehended
the case, how he must have darted off, like the celebrated Mr.
Jingle, as he went out jauntily, singing to the spinster Aunt,
“In hurry post haste for a licence, -
In hurry, ding dong, I come back 1"
And back he did return as quick as possible with the full permis-
sion of all the Doctors on all the Commons to take Mlle. SARA
BERNHARDT to be his wedded wife, and the rites were got through
as quickly as possible by Mr. GREENwooD, the Assistant Curate,
who seems (also, according to the aforesaid account) to have been
rather perplexed and worried by the whole affair being so hurried.
However, the “Merry GREEN wood” did his best, and the knot was
tied. Among the very few witnesses was the M. MAYER, of Gaiety
French-play celebrity. This must be satisfactory to those who are
not content unless the ceremony takes place devant M. le Maire, as
this was devant M. le MAYER—the German-French spelling and the
English pronunciation of this name being as “mixed” as was this
remarkable marriage, in which the representatives of the two great
divisions of Christianity, West and East,-for M. DAMALA is a Greek,
—were united by an Anglican, who evidently had “no devotion to
the deed,” at a season when marriages are forbidden by Canon law,
and which was witnessed by a member of the ancient Hebrew dis-
pensation, which, however, was not either of the dispensations
required for the transaction. Publicity has been given to an affair
which, after all, is “nothing to nobody” but themselves, and, per-
haps, the “Merry GREEN wood.” May the proverb about “Married
in haste” be falsified in this instance; or, rather, may the happ
consequences of this runaway match be the glorious exception º
shall prove the truth of the general rule.

The Physiology of that will make a Maiden stare.
Here’s Doctor MILNER Foth ERGILL, a wise Physician, he

Young Ladies risk a fell disease by showing necks and throats,
While wiser Men wrap up their chests in stiff shirts and dress-coats.
There's much in what the Doctor says; a dress cut very low
Is dangerous, though Fashion may declare it comme il faut ;
And Ladies who wear such attire must *::::::::::::
Though it is called a full-dress robe, it’s very like undress.
So leave low bodices behind at theatre and ball;

That, thanks to Physiology, you know much better now.
SIMPLE STORIES FOR LITTLE GENTLEFOLK.
“Be always kind to animals wherever you may bel”—Elderly Lady.
No. IV.-NINA AND THE NEWT.
NINA was a very clever and good little girl. Now, a girl may be
clever without being good, but NINA had kind and judicious parents
who taught her how to turn her talents to the best account. She
was very fond of F.
and drawing, and her dear
Papa had given her a nice
little box of moist water-
colours, some beautiful
sable-brushes, and a large
sketching-block on her last
birthday. The little girl
Was as hº as happy
could be. She used to go
out sketching from nature
almost every day in Evelyn
Copse. She would start
early in the morning with
her painting apparatus, a
little basket containing three apple-puffs, a bottle of milk, and some
arliament—gingerbread, and very often she would not return till
inner-time. Her only guardian was an enormous English mastiff
named “Tiny,” who was said to be even more trustworthy than
the Family Solicitor.
One day as NINA was sketching and singing a merry little song, a
sleek, saucy-looking, bright-eyed Newt came forth. Now, many
little girls would have jumped up, gathered their frocks around
them, and screamed, and perhaps run away. Not so, NINA. She
continued her song, and was amused to see the Newt begin to dance
to her singing, and to notice what exquisite time he kept. When
she ºppº the Newt lay down and panted, apparently much ex-
hausted. “I dare say Sir Isa AcNEwton would like some luncheon,”
said she. . The light-hearted reptile smiled at the little girl's witti-
cism, and nodded his head violently. He gobbled up eagerly the
whole of an º: uff, he bolted eight times his own weight in
parliament, and he had to be hauled out of the milk-bottle by the
tail. Having been so gloriously entertained, he disappeared alto-
gether, łºś to f" on with her picture, and meditate on the
ingratitude of Newt-kind.
he had given away half her luncheon, like the kind little girl
she was, so soon º to feel very hungry, and ready to start
dinnerwards earlier than usual. On packing up her things she was
alarmed to discover she had lost her best sable-pencil. She hunted
high and low. It was nowhere to be found. “O dear! 0 dear!
what shall I do?” said the poor child, covering her face with her
hands, and bursting into tears. “W-what, w=ill—p-papa –
say? He g-gave t-ten shillings for it at W-WINsor AND NEw-
§§ the other day!”. When she uttered the word “Newton,”
she, heard a faint cry, and looking down, saw her friend the Newt
with her pencil in mouth. He laid the lost brush garefully at
the little girl's feet, gave her a touching look of gratitude, and was
gone before she had time to thank him. She never saw the Newt
again, but she always º the pencil he found; and when she
grew up to be a big girl, and exhibited pictures at the
Allºy, she never forgot this pleasing little episode of Evelyn
opse.

SIMPLE STORIES FOR LITTLE GENTILEFOLK.
“Be always kind to animals wherever your may bel”—Elderly Lady.
No. W.—WIOLET AND THE WULTURE.
WIoIET was playing with the other children in the garden, when
a great ugly, red-throated, beaky, disreputable old Vulture came
staggering over the fence, and alighted on the lawn. The rest of
the children were fright-
ened out of their wits, and
ran away and hid them-
selves. There was some-
thing, however, about the
dissipated old bird that
awakened the pity of the
little lass, and she re-
mained. She found he had
been grievously hurt. One
- of his wings was bound
- with copper-wire, so that
-Z, he could not use it, and
-sms- his foot was fearfully
- - wounded and bleeding.
Her heart was touched. With great difficulty she freed his wings,
and was terribly frightened when the bird flapped them, and shook
his wicked old, head at her. She then bathed his talon-playfull
remarking at the same time that he was a talented bird—and toreo
her beautiful Valenciennes tucker, and with the greatest care bound
up the wound. The Vulture took flight, WIoI.ET was slapped by her
Mamma for losing her tucker, and everyone thought the matter was
at an end. The best part of the story, however, is to come.
Two weeks afterwards, WIoI.ET was wandering by herself in the
Gloaming Gorge. She lost her way, and walked and walked for
hours, but seemed to get further off home than ever. The sun was
going down, soon it would be dark, and she began to get very
frightened, thinking she would never see herdear Mamma again. She
lay down on her face in a heap of fern, and wept till she could wee
no longer. Presently she felt a tapping on her shoulder, and turne
round, half hoping to see the features of her dear old Nurse. To her
surprise she saw her old friend the Vulture, looking grimmer and
more repulsive than ever. -
Before she had time to think, the talons of the bird, were fixed
firmly in her petticoats: she was borne aloft, and whirled at a ter-
rific pace through the air, and Fº deposited on the lawn of her
own home. She was smothered with kisses by Mamma and Nurse.
When they recovered from their surprise, the Vulture, was gone.
He however left WIoIET's strip of Valenciennes behind him, nicely
washed and carefully pinned up. VI was never slapped for losing
her tucker again; # her Mamma often remarks, “A girl who
would lift her hand to a Vulture, save in the way of kindness, is not
worthy of the name of WIOLET.”

(On second thoughts.) “E—H ! I 'LL BE BAD THE MoRN ' ' "
FROM A SPANISH SUNNY 'UN.
SPAIN is one of those countries in which too many Cooks have not succeeded in spoiling
the tours. The British tourist is a black swan in Spain, and a white elephant in Africa. The
reason is not far to seek. He has been systematically frightened. They tell him garlic will
be his food, and brigands his companions. They tell him that while he is merely robbed in
Italy, he will be skinned alive in Andalusia. They tell him that while soap is made in Castile,
it is as scarce as oysters in Whitstable, or sausages in ºf They tell him that the
Spaniards stick at everything and everybody, except trifles. They tell him that while in
º countries a knife and fork are always waiting for the traveller, in Spain it is the
knife without the fork. They ask him if he can live on black bread and rancid, oil, and
drink wine which no chemist would sell as physic without a shudder. They tell him, in
fact, the pretty stories that are usually told to the Marines, and they succeed in keeping
his valuable custom for Italy, France, and Germany.
When the adyenturous traveller disregards these warnings, and thinks and acts for him-
self, he is surprised to find that a journey to Madrid is much like a journey to any other
continental capital. He has to put up with slow trains, and travel night after night—the
usual penalty of continental travelling—
but he is not crammed in close carriages,
as in France, nor compelled to journey like
a Prince or an Englishman, as in Germany.
He gets travelling comforts at moderate
prices, and he finds the “sleeping car” an
accepted institution. As he draws within
fifty or sixty miles of Madrid, he finds
himself in a wild country, that looks like
a gigantic stone-yard capable of employing
all the paupers of Europe. He crosses a
boundless desert of granite filled with fan-
tastic stone demons that grin like rough-
and-ready Sphinxes at the P.P.
senger. He wonders if this can the
place which is known to explorers as Stony
Stratford.
As he nears Madrid, the stone desert
changes to a sandy prairie, in which the
houses are planted. The outskirts of the
City look like patches of Nº Hill and
Bayswater dropped, here and there, in a
Spanish Sahara. The new houses are
strangely English, and strangely modern.
The city itself is like a small Brussels, with-
out the Flemish antiquities, and the oldest
parts of the place have a decided aspect of
the day before yesterday. With the most
wonderful history in the world enshrined in
books, not one page of this is stamped upon
the buildings. Paris, which has conquered
so many cities, has conquered Madrid, as
one day it will conquer London, with, or
without, the Channel Tunnel. The “pot.”
and the “chimney-pot” hat are on the
heads of the men, though the mantilla still
clings to a few of the heads of the women.
The cloak has not been altogether super-
seded by the overcoat, but it harmonises
very badly with the imported head-cover-
ing. Anything more absurd than a Spanish
cloak and a London tall hat has yet to be
discovered amongst the numerous eccentri-
cities of costume.

to whom I at once entrusted the management of the business details.
He secured a small unfurnished house in the neighbourhood—and I
need hardly say it was soon well stocked. For further security,
Mr. RYTE became my tenant, one quarter down in advance; and out
of the number of balloons sent down for me to try I selected one
which seemed in all respects admirably adapted for my purpose.
As the others were labelled “On Sale or Return,” I let ’em all go
sailing away, but of course cannot exactly forecast the precise
moment of their return.
The balloon I used on this occasion I made myself, and call it the
Herr Puffendorff, in gratitude to the old Professor from whom I
learnt all the German I know.
Publishers wired back that they closed with my offer, and two of
their firm would attend to sign the contract.
In the evening came a note from Old Pa' Joy Es, requesting me to
give his Jalaphine Jujube a turn in France. To this my Secretary
replied, point blank, that “Mr. Old Pa’ Jon Es ought to know better
than to suppose that on any consideration whatever Your Own
Balloonist would, could, should, or ought to undertake the adver-
tising agency for him and his worn-out old humbug of a Jujube.”
Morning of the Event.—Half the Fº: firm appeared, that is,
Messrs. CHUck and PICKLEJOHN. They had a long deed with them,
repared by their lawyers. As they seemed to doubt my word, I
§. them to leave the signing until the last moment, when, I
added, sarcastically, “You may be perfectly sure I am going up as
I have said.”
Abashed, they agreed to defer completion of contract.
I will not detain you with a list of things I had carefully stowed
away with me in the car of the balloon, but suffice it that, being an
old hand at this sort of thing, I took provisions for six months, with
writing materials, several packs of cards, and a dice-box.
At midnight we began inflating. I had impressed secresy on my
Publishers, and as I was unwilling to employ assistants from any
other Publishers' houses, I was compelled to utilise the services of
Messrs. CHUCK and PICKLEJohn in Pºiº gas into the balloon,
They went at it with a will, turn and turn about, while I supplied
them with champagne, MUMMERY & Jouno's très sec, and kept 'em
at their work like men till 4 A.M., when CHUCK gave in, and asked
to be allowed to go to bed for an hour or so. On condition of
his signing a power-of-attorney for PICKLEJoHN to act for him while
he was asleep, I gave him the required permission, and more dead
than alive from the unwonted exertion and the smell of the gas, he
dragged himself upstairs to bed.
A knock at the outer door, and the cards of two rival Publishing
Firms (brought in by RYTE–good man, RYTE) from London asking
to be allowed to inflate the balloon, and give me a start with one
thousand pounds down, acted like magic on the jaded energies of
PICKLEJohn.
By six the balloon was ready, and the basket-car was attached to
it by a peculiar mechanical contrivance of my own, for which I have
now taken out a patent. The fastenings of my balloon are so
managed, that a child lifting up a pin from the ground can detach
the whole system of ropes, chains and pulleys at once, and away it
goes. PICKLEJOHN had delivered his last blow, and was in a
fainting state, when some careless person lifted up his inanimate
form and deposited him in the balloon underneath some rugs, so that
in the hurry and excitement of the moment, I did not notice the
incumbrance that I would most willingly have left behind. For I
had determined to #. alone, and one extra pound's weight of ballast
might be fatal to the success of my venture.
. RYTE's little boy, aged six, had his hand on the “go-pin” as it
is called, which, as I have already explained, commands the entire
#. system. I had told him that when I said “off,” he was to
0 01Il,
Whether I said something which sounded like “off,” or whether
the opening of a bedroom window above where CHUCK had been left
asleep, startled the child, I don't know; but before I had time to
look round, the urchin lifted the pin, the ropes fell away right and
left, and the last thing I saw distinctly was CHUCK's head—we could
only have just cleared the tip of his nose by a couple of inches–
peering at me as the huge machine flew up into space at the rate
of 15,000 feet a minute.
Stopping suddenly at an altitude of about 50,000 feet,_" Evidently
too much ballast,” I said to myself, I heard a weak voice asking,
“Where am I?” -
It was PICKLEJoBIN, with the power-of-attorney in his hand, at
the bottom of the car.
“Where are you?”. I replied, sternly. “Why, in my balloon—
trespassing, Sir; and let me tell you, Sir, that as the weight is
exactly regulated and calculated to a nicety, I can only consider you
as extra and unnecessary ballast, to be pitched over should circum-
stances require it.”

IN LONDON ; OR, “TOM AND JERR
Y 2’ BACK AGAIN.
|→:
TOM, JERRY, AND YOUNG LOGIC, AT A GLOVE FIGHT.
CHAPTER II.
ToM AND JERRY received a warm welcome from Young Bob LoGIC,
who conducted them to the hotel where they were to “hang up their
hats” when in the Metrºpolis, On asking for their rooms, a smart
female in a “glass cage” snapped out “No. 100 and 102,” and upon
the CoRINTHIAN asking for an explanation, she vouchsafed none, but
haughtily tossed her head and shut down the window. “We are no
longer men, my dear JERRY,” said ToM, “but numbers, and it does
not appear that the reckoning will include civility. i should cali
that young woman a hussey who does not ‘know her place,’ but it
may be their way of doing business.”
. Next day YoUNg Bob called upon them by appointment for a stroll
in the CoRINTHIAN path, a lounge in Bond STREET, and a strut in
the BURLINGTON ARCADE; “forthere,” said he, “we shall find some
of the Chappies, if they are not too seedy after last night;" a remark,
which caused ToM to .# to JERRY that it “was evident young BOB
was like old LoGIC, and devoted to the bottle.” The Trio turned
into the ARCADE, and saw a number of gay sparks and fair ones
promenading. 'Twas a curious sight, a glimpse of LIFE IN LONDON,
one of its primest features, and yet, as the CoRINTHIAN remarked to
his Coz, these people seemed like the “ghosts of a former genera-
tion.” “These then are the dandies, the fops, the goes, and the
bang-ups, these the CoRINTHIANs of to: alº was also Tom's
exclamation to young BoB, who said, “I don’t know about bein
CoRINTHIANs, but some of these fellows are very “good form,” an
as to being bang-up, a good many poor old Chappies are deuced
hard-up.” “That may well be,” said the CoRINTHIAN, “for they
look as if they had been blown up at Point Nonplus, as your
father used to remark.” “Ah,” said young Bob, “my father was a
game old Cock, but he wouldn't be 'in it” to-day.” The “choice
spirits” of the time strutted up and down before the TRIo, and ToM
and JERRY were amazed at the sight, 'twas so different to their LIFE
IN LONDON. The young ones before them wore curly-brimmed hats
like theirs, very i. *; coats and collars, and they carried sticks
of all kinds, with knobs, hooks, and crutches. They were most of
them hardly out of Pupil's Straits, and yet all were profoundly
solemn, and “Melancholy had marked them for her own;” the
promenaded up and down with glassy eyes, pasty complexions, an
Jeeble steps, and they seemed hardly to have vis enough to smoke the
tiny cigarettes that they puffed so languidly. hey appeared
worn-out and used-up, in need of Dr. PLEASEM's prescriptions and
tonic Waters.
“Good Heavens !” cried the CoRINTHIAN, “are these the tulips ?
are these pallid creatures the representatives of those who in our
days used to be ‘all happiness,” did not care a fig for the Blue
Devils, and who sung my old Chaunt,
* Dancing, singing, full of glee,
0, London, London town for me!’
—the top-of-the-tree members of Society, who were always up, and
never down 2 Ah, JERRY, we might as well go back to THE SHADEs
as be among such a shady crowd.” Young Bob LogIg seemed rather
nettled at this speech of the CoRINTHIAN's, and said, “Well, don't
you know you can't expect a fellow to look very bright till he's had
an “S.-and-B.’ or two and a Kümmel ? These pals will be all right
after dinner.” “Let us hope they will,” said the CoRINTHLAN,
“for they look all to pieces now.” At which JERRY, and young
Logic laughed heartily. “But,” ToM continued, “though your
father, my dear BoB, was an habitué of the Province of Bacchus, I
never heard, of him “sluicing his ivories’ with what you call
‘S.-and-B.’”
In the evening, after they had dined, young BoB proposed takin
ToM and JERRY to witness a “set-to.” “With all my heart,” sai
the CoRINTHIAN. “You remember Mr. JACKson, and the rooms in
Bond Street P I consider boaring a manly exercise when properly
practised.” A carriage was soon at the door, and our HEROES
reached the rendezvous, when great was their astonishment to find
it was a Chapel / “No one is fonder of the noble art of self-defence,”
said the CoRINTHIAN, “than I am ; but I was not prepared for a
set-to in a place of worship.” However, our heroes entered, thinking
that times had indeed changed. inside there was a very motley
crowd. Snide Coves, and flue-fakers, and flash men of all kinds
were there sporting their blunt, and a ring was soon formed. But
in truth it was no proper specimen of the Art of Self-Defence, the
gloves were mere shams, and TQM and JERRY saw with disgust that
it was a vulgar mill, with no display of pugilistic science. Young
Bob also said that they were a rowdy lot, and it was not what he
expected, while there seemed every Fº of a general kick-up.
ToM and JERRY, who remembered their visit in old days to the
Champion, agreed that if this was the way in which people saw
“life and sport,” it was more fit for Dusty Bob and his friends of
the Sluicery, than for gentlemen. “No, my dear young BQB,” said
the CoRINTHIAN, “show us something better worth attention than
this “vulgar row.” And Mr. LoGIC promised to comply with their
request.

DUELLOMANIA.
(A Bit of the Diary of Jules, Chroniqueur.)
FIRST time this week that I have been able to get up at a decent
hour. Shall do an article to-morrow suggesting after-dinner duels.
To consult my Editor about it; might begin by calling him out.
Bon / Printer's devil called, and the Editor calls me out. Shook
hands with ADoIPHE of the Canard Quotidien the day before yes-
terday, and ADOLPHE is at daggers and long bows drawn with my
redacteur. Tell MARIE to call me early again to-morrow, and order
JEAN to clean the fencing foils. Awful mistake that, sticking my
friend ALPHoNSE (of the Radical Rageur) through the arm; makes
one's sword in such a mess. Consult my Duel by Double Entry
Book, and find that I am only second to three people to-day. Paris
is evidently getting more pacific. -
First Seconding-Call on the Novelist OLALA, who has libelled our
mutual friend the Painter PANET, by saying that yellow-ochre skies
aren't natural. Arrange for cavalry sabres, and have bocks over the
inevitable procès verbal.
Second Seconding.—Becoming rather complicated, this. Have to
call on PANET, on behalf of our mutual friend FARCEY. PANET has
publicly said that no critic can be worth anything who wears
spectacles—and FARCEY would wear *...*. and telescopes if he
could. Arrange for carbines at three hundred mêtres.
Third Seconding.—My good friend MoquELIN, the Actor, has a
case against, PANET (for having rendered pug, noses ridiculous),
FARCEY (for having said nothing about him in his last feuilleton)
and against OLALA (for having half intended to give him a part of
less than eleven hundred lines). Yataghans, torpedoes, and mitrail-
leuses selected. More bocks. Begin to think I shall find it rather
difficult to get up to-morrow morning. -
Next Morning.—Do find it difficult, not to say painful; but
manage with the assistance of three siphons of eau de Seltz, and am
in time to catch the 5'50 Duellist Excursion Train. -
Result.-PANET scratched on forefinger; OLALA, eyebrows singed;
FARCEY, indigestion because of the dinner of reconciliation. 'And
they have all called me out for having allowed matters to reach such
a desperately dangerous pass.

ABINGDON.—There was a large influx of visitors here
to-day, who, however, speedily left on hearing that a
special meeting of the Salvation Army was to be held.
BRIGHToN.—The Salvation Army marched in proces-
sion through the Streets of the Queen of Watering-
Places to-day in great numbers. Beyond some score of
black eyes, the ceremony created little excitement.
CHESTER.—A great demonstration was made here to-
day by the Salvation Army—a demonstration crowned
by the greatest success, only mitigated by the fact that
one of our leading townsmen happening to come in con-
tact with the Army, received a broken nose.
DERBY.—Amongst the cases tried here to-day was that
of John SMITH, who was arraigned for having on the
#. day grievously interfered with the usual out-
oor meetings of the Salvation Army. The defence set
up was that the prisoner's wife was seriously ill, and
that for four hours over a thousand members of the
Army sang, shouted, and holloaed outside his house, and
that thereupon, being annoyed, he threw some cold clean
water over two or three roughs who were making them-
selves, particularly obnoxious. The Magistrates held
that the Salvation Army must be protected, and sen-
tenced SMITH to fourteen days' hard labour.
EDINBURGH.—A mass *ś the Salvation Army
was held here to-day. That this body is doing good
work, is amply proved by the fact, that out of the large
growds that attended the meeting only one person was
beaten within an inch of his life.
. Huppersfield.—With bands of music and with song
did the Salvation Army promenade this town to-day.
The promenade was a great triumph, but we would call
the attention of the Huddersfield Commanders of the
Army to the fact that better places to hold their meet-
ings might be ghosen than that in the immediate vicinity
of the Hospital. We say this in no invidious or carpin
spirit, but we understand that during the progress ;
the meeting some seven inmates of the Hospital died of
fright.
LEEDs.-The largest meeting ever held of the Salvation
Army in this town took place to-day. Up to the time of
sending this telegram only ten casualties, of which not
more than two are expected to prove fatal, has come
within our knowledge.

to higher things, that the tradesmen of our principal thoroughfares have pro-
tested against the Salvation Army, on the miserably insufficient grounds, that
they have to close their shops during the passing by of the Army, on account
of the riots which inevitably ensue, we are loath to believe. Yet such is the
common report.
NEwcasTLE-UPoN-TYNE. — Three men were sentenced to-day to terms of
six, nine, and twelve months hard labour respectively, for assaulting members
of the Salvation Army. The prisoners pleaded that they had been first assaulted
and called several witnesses to prove this, but the Bench nevertheless foun
them guilty.
SHEFFIELD.—No less than nineteen burglaries, which, under ordinary circum-
stances might have been called daring, were brought to an issue, successful so
far as the thieves were concerned, in the suburbs of this town to-day: Those
who have been robbed of their jewels and their plate, are complaining in some-
what bitter and acrimonious terms of the negligence of the police, apparently
forgetting, that owing to the extensively advertised meeting of the Salvation
Army, the greater bulk of our constables had to be told off to preserve order.
York.-The meeting of the Salvation Army here to-day has led to a riot, in
which, unfortunately, the Minster was burnt to the ground.

ºf him earning any money for his creditors or himself. In those
bad old days did a man outrun the constable, he was placed in the
Fleet or the Queen's Bench, where he led an idle, dissipated, racket

as his means allowed; he could render existence fairly tolerable—
nay, comfortable, to a man of sedentary habits.
All this was abolished. There is now noimprisonment for debt—
at least you have to show cause why you shouldn't be imprisoned for
five weeks, or, if you can pay, and won't pay, till you’re made to
pay. But men still are foolish enough to owe money. If they do
not pay, they are guilty of contempt of Court. There is now no

192 PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
[APRIL 22, 1882.
In an instant the Provost had dropped his
arm, and, aghast at the i.º.º. Was
facing the hero of the school, whose pluck
had been tried in the Eton furnace, for he
had come successfully out of the Lower and
Upper Removes, confident that two removes
are as good as a fire.
The Provost, therefore, was likely to have
it hot from the handsome, splashing, dashing,
daring chum, to whom his nine hundred
companions had, by common consent, assigned
the name of “Eton Bob.”
“Go it, Bob l’” shouted the now rallying
Upper Fifth in chorus, and as they did so
the air was darkened by a heavy shower of
Latin Dictionaries.
It was an exciting scene.
One of the largest struck the Provost at
the back of his leg below the knee. It can-
noned off sharply, and he followed its course
with the eve .# a connoisseur. For he had a
library of his own, but he had never yet seen
a volume of such bulk bound so neatly in
his own favourite calf.
Thus the diversion was, for the moment,
complete. The lovely Perkussian drew a
breath of relief.
Yet the Reverend Roppſ N PICKLE, B. & S.,
Baker Street Prizeman, and Odd-Fellow
of his year, was not made of stuff to be
trifled with. He had commenced his college
life as a sizar, and this at first had often
sent him to the wall. At this time he was
regarded rather as an under sizer. But
greats gave him his chance. A man of much
breadth, he suddenly rose also to such an ex-
traordinary degree, that he was acknowledged
on all sides as a remarkable over sizer,
was made Banting Lecturer, and from that
moment his weight in the University was
felt to be immense. Proofs of this were not
ºf wanting. He no sooner took his place
in his college boat, than it, instantly went to
the bottom of the river. They appointed him
to the vacant chair of Modern History.
The legs came off. Everything gave way
before him. He tried for the Newdigate
and took it off its hinges.
Such had been the antecedents of the
Provost: and as he stood there, towering
above the refractory form, seven feet two
in his shoes, and flourishing the good tradi-
tional old Eton Cat in his hand, it became
quite clear that whatever, were the precise
merits of the matter in dispute, it was his
intention to settle them at once himself by
coming down heavily.
But Bob saw his opportunity.
With a bound like that of a spring onion,
he darted forward, and, seizing by the collar
a dark, swarthy, sixth-form boy, whose
name of HADJI NUFF sufficiently betokened
his near relationship to the Shah of PERSIA,
dexterously thrust him in the way of the
descending lash.
The ruse saved the lovely Perkussian, for,
with a dull resounding thud, the heavy thongs
went quietly home on the back of the highly-
connected Asiatic's Eton jacket.
He winced. For a moment they reminded
him of his º life on the Sahara. But he
had got more than his deserts, and the Pro-
vost was annoyed. He had wished to cul-
tivate this youth, and now he had managed
to give him the cut direct. He turned with
ºubled energy again towards the terrified
girl.
There was not a moment to be lost.
“I’m only a light weight,” cried our hero,
facing his reverend antagonist, “but the cry
of a beautiful female in distress is never
heard in vain by Eton Bob.”
And with this manly speech, he seized the
Provost tightly by the band of his cassock,
and whirling him aloft seven feet in the air,
hurled him with an easy effort through the
window of the class-roominto the qu gle
beneath.
CHAP. II.
The secret or THE TRUNK.
THERE was a shout of triumph from the
Upper Fifth, and the fair Perkussian was
about to reward Bob for her timely deliverance
with a kiss, when a packet of letters, and a
couple of miniatures in twelve inch frames,
that had fallen from the breast-pocket of the
Provost's clerical waistcoat, caught her eye.
She eagerly devoured their contents. "Oh!
heaven l’” she cried, “he is my father!”
Bob looked gallantly out of window.
“In that case, be of good cheer,” he said,
“he is not hurt, ma chere." The Under
Provost happened to be passing at the time.
Your father, who went for the fall with
judgment, is quite in his proper place. He
came safely down upon the top of him. Ah,
machère, you'll soon be at a premium!”
“But the poor Under Provost!” she replied,
sadly. “I am afraid he must be below Pal”
Bob would have made an encouraging
reply, but at that moment a coal sack was
thrown over his head, and the fair Perkussian
was borne swiftly from the class-room by a
masked figure in an Eton jacket.
In less than ten minutes her prostrateform
was being carried through a long subter-
ranean passage, to a dungeon beneath Wind-
sor Castle.
(To be continued.)
THE “CRI " AND THE LAUGH.
TALK of the ensemble of French companies, there isn't one of
them that can surpass, or even come up with, the company at the
Criterion, so admirably trained by Mr. WYNDHAM, who is the life and
soul of such pieces as Fourteen Days, which owes all the fun of its
Prison Discipline.
capital dialogue to Mr. H. J. ByRoN, the humour of its situations to
the French originators—two of 'em, of course it generally takes two
or three, sometimes four, to construct a plot—and its success to the
.#: the Criterion company individually and collectively. Com-
pare Hot-Bath Fields Prison interior with the prison interior at the
Adelphi, and then exclaim with Peregrine Porter, “What trash these
press fellows do write about the hardship of our prison system l’”
I don't understand why. Mr. GIDDENs, who is imprisoned with
Mr. WYNDHAM, has his hair cut short, while the latter's iocks are
left unshorn. But something has to be conceded to a low comedian.
Mr. STANDING is excellent as a superior sort of Maudle elevated to
the governorship of a prison: a very original notion this. One of
the best played º is that of Jones, the Warder and Butler, whose
representative, Mr. REdwood, is so genuinely earnest throughout.
But this is the great secret of their success at the Criterion, they
are all in earnest, and play as if they thoroughly believed in the
genuine probability of the circumstances in which they find them-
selves. Thus it is that they convey to their audience such an
impression of Reality as is rarely effected except by a very superior
º of, say, for example, the Trial Scene in The Merchant
o entee.
Miss M. RoRKE is invaluable as the loving wife always confiding,
in every piece, in the fidelity and º of Mr. Charles WYND-
HAM, the slightly erratic but thoroughly repentant husband.
Mr. SoTHERN is another illustration of earnestness: so also is Miss
K. RoRRE. If there be the slightest exception, it is to be found in
Mr. BLAKELEY, and in the unnaturally pert servant, played by Miss
WINING. Yet the idiocy of Mr. BLARELEY’s Brummles, is very #º:
in appearance he is like Mr. Dick in David £º with the
action of a punch-doll, and so, perhaps, after all, he must be accepted
as another of the probabilities in which the Criterion company and
audience devoutly, though temporarily, believe.
It is long since I have enjoyed so hearty a laugh as I did at
Fourteen Days. , Judging from what I saw of the first piece, Ruth's
Romance, this also is very well played by Miss HARRINGToN, Mr.
Lytton SoTHERN, and Mr. HAMILTON, Asti Ey who is very amusing,
and to whom Mr. BRoughton, the author of the little one-act drama,
has given some uncommonly good lines. N.B.-This piece in one
act, one scene, and three characters, ought to be a good useful
piece for amateurs.

“NExT morning !”, 'Tis the time in LIFE IN LONDON, when what
looked bright the evening before, looks blue. You have quaffed the
Cup of Pleasure, but the dregs remain, and those must be taken
when you are “beat to a stand-still,” with a haggard face and
fºil appetite, and when you feel inclined to call in Doctor
OLUs.
TThe morning after the events related in our last Chapter, young
Bob Logic had invited JERRY HAwTHoRN, Esq. and CoRINTHIAN
ToM to breakfast with him at his Club. Every Sprig of Fashion in
these days has his Club or several Clubs. He may dine with diplo-
matists at ARTHUR's, with bishops at the ATHENAEUM, with officers
at the UNITED SERVICE, with politicians at BRookes's, with whist-
players at the Port LAND, with, wits at, the GARRICK, and with
Royalty at the MARLBoRoUGH. And as the “downs” imitate the
“ups,” and the “low” people the “high,” there are scores of Clubs
nowadays which, as young LOGIC said, were no better than tap-
rooms, and to which anyone was elected who possessed the blunt.
To such an extent have these sham Clubs been carried, that, as the
CoRINTHIAN remarked when the matter was explained, “It seemed
to him that it would soon be a mark of distinction not to belong to a
CLUB at all.”
At breakfast Young BoB, who was a regular peep-o'-day votary of
Pleasure, felt, as he ... it, “ consumedly seedy.” ToM AND
JERRY pressed the viands upon him, they recommended the kidneys,
and praised the foaming tankards º beer before them, which
reminded the CoRINTHIAN, as he observed to JERRY, of the “hum-
ming stingo” at HAwTHORN HALL. Young BoB could eat nothing,
but called for Soda Water, upon which the high-mettled CoRINTHIAN
remarked to his Coz that “it was evident the larks of the Metropolis
were telling on young Bob's debilitated frame, and that if he went
on with incessant ‘DAY AND NIGHT scENEs,’ he would one day receive
notice to quit.” JERRY quite agreed with ToM, remembering how he
himself had been “out of wind” in old times when the day and
º: work had been too much for him ; but young Bob said a
“B.-and-S.” would soon pull him together, and that he would be
quite at their disposal later in the day.
That evening Qung Bob 'proposed that Tom and JERRY should
look in at “THE CRI,” as he called it, observing “there was always
a pal or two at the BAR.” The CoRINTHIAN observed that he was
glad Young BoB knew some gentlemen of the long robe, who were
usually very entertaining, upon which BoB said, laughing, that he
did not mean any of the pundits of the Temple, but the fellows who
would look in, “don’t you know,” to have a liquor, for the “bar”

he meant was a tavern. “We are quite ready,” said Tom. “Show
us any touch of LIFE IN LONDON, my dear Bob, where we can see
CHARACTER, mix with GAIETY, and follow the FASHIoN.” So the
TRIO departed for THE CRITERION, and it was a curious sight indeed
that saluted their eyes. There was a vast saloon, down one side of
which ran an enormous drinking-bar, while behind it stood a row of
attendant HEBEs, ready to flirt, laugh, ogle, smile and chaff with the
gayest boys of their acquaintance. “This is indeed something new,”
said JERRY, “I remember the Sydney Gardens at Bath, and the
lories of WAUxHALL, but there was nothing like this in our LIFE IN
NDON.” “You are right, my dear Coz,” returned the CoRINTHIAN,
“Here, WENUs and BACCHUs are at our elbows, and PLEASURE seems
to hold her Court in a Public House !” Round each of the Maids of
the Inn was a bevy of attendant Cavaliers, who all seemed on such
familiar terms with her, that she had eyes for no one else, and a
stranger, not “in the swim,” could hardly get refreshment for the
inner man. One courted CHARLOTTE, another ogled OLIVIA, one
sighed for SUSAN, another maundered over MARY, others languished
for LILY, or joked with JANE, while Young Bob, who seemed quite
au fait in this Temple of Bacchus, called the attention of our heroes
to the Beauty of the Bar. The plate gives an excellent representa-
tion of this “bit of life,” and is a fine specimen of the artist in his
personification of CHARACTER.
Most of the gallants who were “practising at the bar” were in
evening dress. They had low foreheads, and wore big “button-
holes,” for so they termed the flowers it was “the thing” to wear:
A good many of them, too, had been partaking freely of daffy, and
ñá been on a visit to the Isles of Bishop and Flip, for, as young
Bob explained, he expected they had been in and out” all day.
While Logic was engaged in “making the running” with one of
the young ladies, and talking to his Chums, the CORINTHIAN re-
marked to JERRY on the queer scene around them;... “We ‘stood to
our guns,’ my dear Coz,” was ToM's observation, “in the old days,
and did not shirk the bottle, for, in the words of Hippocrates,
“‘The only health to people hale and sound,
Is to have many a tippling health go round.'
Lord BUMPER under the table. But these
‘nips,’ and “pegs,’ and “liquors,” as young Bob calls them,-these
‘S.-and-B.'s,’ and "sherry-and-bitters,'—at all hours of the day,
were unknown to us; and, while we could amuse ourselves with the
Cadgers and at the iſasquerade, we knew nothing of the familiarity
which levels the ‘waitress’ and the “swell’ in this ‘sort of Life.’”

THE “UNITED TROUSERS ’’ v. THE “DIVIDED SKIRTS.”
(With Mr. Punch's Apologies to Lady Harberton.)
OF A LAZY MINSTREL.
SPRING CLEANING.
ALL peace and all pleasure are banished:
Abroad now I gladly would roam,
My quiet and comfort have vanished,
A desolate wreck is my home!
The painters are all in possession,
And charwomen come by the score;
The whitewashers troop in procession,
And spatter from ceiling to floor.
I own I must make a confession,-
Spring Cleaning's a terrible bore!
LAYS
They come in the morning at daybreak,
Just when I'm forgetting my cares,
And into my slumbers how they break!
With bustle and tramp on the stairs.
They laugh, and they whistle, and chatter;
They paint, and they varnish, and size;
They thump, and they wrangle, and clatter,
And drive away sleep from my eyes.
They make me as mad as a hatter,
And cause me quite early to rise!
The staircase is all barricaded,
The handle removed from each door;
My own sacred Den is invaded—
My papers all strewn on the floor!
My books and my letters are scattered,
My pens are nowhere to be found;
My blue-and-white china is shattered,
y songs have no space to resound;"
My hat with pink priming's bespattered,
My Banjo is crushed on the groundlt
I dare not complain, notwithstanding,<
I'm faint with the fumes of whitelead;
And trip over pails on the landing,
And paint-pots fall down on my head!
When right through my hall I go stumbling—
I’m sick, and I’m sorry, and sore;
O'er planks and o'er ladders I’m tumbling,
And get my great-coat painted o'er.
To myself I can scarcely help mumbling,<-
Spring Cleaning’s a terrible bore!

FROM A SPANISH SUNNY 'UN.
IF the Peninsular War had had a different termination, Madrid
could hardly be more Frenchified than it is. From the cooking in
the hotels to the afternoon drive in the Prado, everything goes to
make a little Paris. An exception may be made to the Prado.
While it imitates Paris, it excels it. The carriages are more numer-
ous and better appointed than they are in the Bois de Boulogne.
Whether the Spaniard was born with a cigarette in his lips may be
open to discussion, but it is certain that he lives and dies with one.
In the churches he barely leaves it outside the sacred doors.
The staple product of Spain, next to sherry, appears to be oranges,
and the principal occupation appears to be sucking oranges.
At one time—many years ago—the staple production was pictures.
The noted firm of MURILLO & Co. were the great manufacturers of
Holy Families, wholesale, retail, and for exportation, and it requires
more than the eye of an expert to say where the master's hand ends
and the pupil's begins.
A Spaniard has no sense of the value of time. It is the country
of the aloe, and the aloe, according to the tradition, blooms once
in a century. ...This plant grows in great luxuriance along the
sides of the railway to Seville. Its example appears to affect the
railway service. An express train is a train that runs only three
times a week, at the wonderful speed of fifteen to eighteen miles an
hour. The ordinary trains give plenty of time for the passengers to
watch the blooming of the aloe.
If the Spaniards are not more blood-thirsty than any other nation,
they take much pains to make you believe that they are. A man
like a human hedgehog, with his body half govered with stilletos and
knives, endeavours to sell these cheerful wares during the ten
minutes allowed for refreshment at Alcazar, on the road to Seville.
Qf course the man is a Toledo blade, and of course his wares come
from Toledo... If they are as harmless as the cutlery of the country,
they may be trusted in the hands of children and idiots. As one
approaches Seville, one sees Spain. National costume appears at the
road-side stations, mixed with long-eared mules and aldermanic
priests. In the distance white-washed cities, like streaks of snow
upon the hills, relieve the monotony of the sandy plains. Groves of
olive-trees, long lines of prickly pears, the aloes and the orange-trees
represent the leading vegetation of the country, and the natives
basking idly in the sun, represent the rest.
Arrived at Seville, º feel you are really in Spain, and severed as
much as it is possible to be from Parisian influences. Seville is
Spain in a nut-shell. It is more than this. It is an unique city.
There is only one place in Europe that would make another Seville
and that is Venice. Venice drained, with its narrow canals turned
into narrow alleys, would be a second Seville, but nothing would
ive it the cleanliness and fragrance of the Moorish-Spanish city.
ville is a city of marble, as London is a city of stucco.

A TRIAL AT BAR; OR, THE NORTH-EAST PASSAGE.
EXTRACT FROM THE DIARY OF A SUSPECT.
Monday.-Really quite pleasant to be out again. Saw two
sympathisers hiding behind a post on the Quay. They concealed
something under their cloaks—evidently two addresses of congratu-
lation. Very good of them, but I must not have anything to do with
them. Promised the Government to keep my parole. Tore myself
away without extorting a single cheer. Embarked for England.
Tuesday.—London really delightful. Saw the two sympathisers
again on my track. Good fellows, but slightly inconvenient. Must
hide. Did so by spending the day at Madame TUssaud's, and the
evening at a music-hall. My “portrait model” excellent—especi-
ally the boots. Rather annoyed at a topical song containing an
uncomplimentary personal allusion. The acrobats and the conjuror,
however, first-rate.
Wednesday.—Off to Paris. Lots of friends wrote to say that they
would come to see me off by the short sea route. Good fellows! But
I wish they wouldn't. Had to go by Newhaven and Dieppe. Awful
assage I Fancy I caught a glimpse of the two sympathisers hiding
ehind a paddle-box. Fortunately they were too bad sailors to
attend to me.
Thursday.—In Paris. The old place simply elegant. Attended
to my private affairs, and spent the rest of my time in § the
rounds. Must not be recognised, so assumed a false nose, and dined
chez Champot. Found that the two *. had tried to gain
admittance to º cabinet particulier. They were very properly
refused entrance by a judicious garçon.
Friday:-To avoid friends, once more had to dodge them. Havre
and Southampton route this time. Quite, certain that my two
sympathisers are following me. . Caught a glimpse of them enterin
a third-class carriage as I was ºft for Dublin. ...They have st
t their addresses with them. Awfully grateful fellows, but I can't

“FISH ALL ALIVE, O !”
MR. PUNCH has received a communication from a Salesman of
Billingsgate, of so strange and violent a character that he hesitates
to publish it.
Mr. Punch had his attention drawn, some few weeks ago, to the
evidence given before the Parliamentary Committee on the proposed
Market at Shadwell, by the principal Salesman of Billingsgate, who
stated to the much amused Čommittee that when the naives of that
glassic locality indulged, as was their wont, in language of so power-
ful—not to say º: nature as to absolutely terrify those
not to the manner born, they really meant exactly the same as ordi-
nºiſ folk mean when uttering the kindly wish, “God bless you!”
If this be so, perhaps these Gentlemen, so *:::::: attacked by
their brother Šalesman would have no objection tore the language
in which he writes of them and their oings, and which to their
accustomed ears might sound rather like blessings than curses. But
as his denunciations include some Members of the Corporation, who
may be reasonably expected to take words in their usual acceptation,
Mr. Punch of course refrains from quoting them; but this much he
jº. to his truly Billingsgate correspondent, that he quite intends
to throw the whole weight of his influence and power in favour of
every reasonable proposition for improving the supply and cheapen-
ing the price of fish, quite irrespective alike of ancient charters or of
yested interests or of any tricks of trade. If his correspondent will
furnish him with facts from his own experience, and couched in
reasonable º: that will assist in this great cause, he will
earn the hearty thanks not only of Mr. Punch, but of the great
masses of the poor of the Metropolis, possibly expressed in language
as earnest and as hearty, if not quite so powerful, as his own.

NOTES FROM THE DIARY OF A CITY
WAITER.
WE seems to be a gitting on pretty well at the Mansion
House in regards to Royalty. We thinks nothink of
having a Hair º and 2 or 3 Royal Dooks a drop-
ping in to Lunch now and then, and then having quite
a frendly chat about Music and the Opera. I’m told as
how the Copperation will have to stump up M.
Hansom (no elusion to the Sherryfess), for the Musica
Collidge, but what of that so long as we gits the opper-
tunity of gazing upon Royalty and talking to it quite in
the family way.
To be sure it isn't the same as having 'em to Dinner,
and their Royal Inesses' Gentlemen complanes werry
bitterly of not having their customary little Bankwet
down below when they cums into the City.
One on 'em told me only on Monday, that tho' of course
they has their Turtel at home, it’s somethink quite differ-
ent to the reel thing. In fac more like little Turtel and
Water | He hadded with a sy that he found a good plate-
full of good thick City Turtel that support to his sumwat
enfeebled constitushun, that enabled to go thro' with
his trying dooties with cumparitive ees.
Ah! that must be a terribel fatiging life, that must,
riding behind a coach sumtimes for ours together |
But then what a reward
Fancy being always able to gaze in the face of Royalty
or at any rate to look at the backs of Royalty's hats and
bonnets, and to breath the same Hair when Royalty has
quite done with it!
What a change has cum over the Spirits of our Drams,
as the Poet says. Last year we was all that sollem at
the Mansion House, that one would amost have thought
the New Copperation had arrived, and was in deep
mournin' for the Old 'un, but now we dances ..º. like
Turps Siccory, whoever he may have bin, proberbly the
fashnable Dancing Master of his perod.
Is it Jellersy, is it Pride, or is it Pitty? I paws for
a reply. I had quite a nice frendly chat with one of the
Prince's Gentlemen, he sed, in the affablest manner,
“while you wotes us sich lots of money and gives us sich
sumpshus reparsts, we shall all stand by you to a man!”
What a distangy style there is about 'em. Of the 2, I
prefers’em to their Masters. The Princes is jest a leetle
too afable, but you can't find that fault with their Gentlemen, tho' a glass or
two of old Madeery does unbend 'em a bit, but before that there's a Aughty
Demeaner about 'em that’s somethink to wunder at. They told me one or two
little pickaunt ancedotes that might emuse the world.º.But no l I shall carry
my secrets with me to my Toom! As future: *ges asked who was “JEw

BROWN was at the Dinner and says it was real Jam to have a Waiter a
Williº: a Waiter with a Waiter in his hand and calling a Waiter, Sir!
The LoRD MARE said that the Waiter's wocation was precarious, I haven't
the least idea what he meant, but I think it was werry kind of his Lordship.
Sir JoHN BENNET spoke out like a trew Night, as never wants no winding up.
He sed, and no doubt werry truly, that sumtimes when he looked behind his
chair he didn't know whether it was his Chapling his Wicar or his Waiter |
and he didn't know which was the usefullest of the three. I think I could have
told him if I had bin there.
BRow N tells me he was in that state of exsitement at his unercustomed persi-
tion, and at having nothink to do but to eat and drink, that he quite forgot to
subscribe nothink, and couldn't quite remember exacly how much money was
guy, but he thinks it was between a hundred pound and a thousand. -

before the Dinner is begun, insted of a good deal arter, and then I dessay I

A DIFFICULT CASE.
DEAR Doctor PUNCH,
I HAVE written to the
Lancet, but it's no good.
They won't take any notice
of me. Some nonsense about
“medical etiquette,” I dare-
say. Now look here. This is
my case. I have a terrible
toothache, and take plenty of
port wine. My toothache is
cured, but I get racking pains
in the head. I cure this by
sal volatile, which, however
brings on indigestion, and
gives me fearful agony in the
chest. For this I take a pint
of champagne, which at once
relieves me, but brings on a
sharp attack of the gout in my
left foot. I take a dose of
colchicum, I drink nothing
but lemon and potass, -my
system becomes lowered. I
again take cold. The same

does in it;, as we presume the series of lectures on the tableaux

and has about eight encore verses which much delight his audience.

As a spectacle it is unsurpassed by any previous production at the
Alhambra. The scenery is quite the best they have ever had.
Babil and Bijou is just one of those pieces which, were it care-
fully renovated from time to time, fitted up with an occasional new
Act, fresh music, novel ballets, and with one. Act devoted, to comic
scenes full of such business as the Martinettis supply, and of inge-
nious mechanical pantomimic tricks, might run for years like the
Pied à Mouton, which began some thirty years or so ago, and is as
lively as ever." There is nothing of this sort in London; and the
Alhambra has got all the appliances and means to boot. But the
Management must not forget that however attractive lovely scenery,
pretty faces, splendid dresses, and first-class dancing and, singing
may be, the public likes to laugh; and if there is not *N. to
laugh at, the popularity of any spectacle cannot be longlived. Now,

Here, too, is a difficult bit of business for a fellow named Alberich.
I quote again:-
“. With desperate efforts he begins to pursue them : with fearful
nimbleness he climbs ridge after ridge, springs from one to the other,
and tries to seize now this maiden, now that, who always escape from
him with mocking laughter; he stumbles, falls into the depths below,
and then climbs hastily up again, -till at last he loses all patience;
breathless, and foaming with rage, he stops, and stretches his clenched
fist up towards the maidens,”
Who'll play this 5. ? Mr. ConquEST with a German name?
If so, and he has had half-a-dozen singing-lessons to enable him to
get through the music somehow or other, won't such a lively gym-
nastic entrance put him a little out of breath?
I wonder what’s the meaning of V
“ Heiayaheia /
Heiayaheia /
Wallalallalala leiayaheia / " ?
Ifancy it's out of a trio sung under water. Perhaps by a diving-
man in a helmet when something has gone wrong with the air-pump.
Fafner seems to have a strong part, and is evidently the tenore
robusto of the cast. Here’s a bit of business for him:—
He raises himself from his bed,—breaks through the thicket, and
** rolls .#forward out of the hollow to the higher ground, so that
he has already reached it with the foremost part of his body. He
now utters a loud yawning sound.” I wonder whether the audience
will take it up, and utter another? A little risky that—isn't it?
No, apparently not; for he has some capital points to wake 'em
up, if they’re at all inclined to drop off, later on. Look at this.
In the middle of a duet with Siegfried, he “opens his jaws and
shows his teeth.’” and then again, a little further down, after a bar
or two, “threatens with his fairº and finally “roars.” That
ought to bring down the house,_and will.
I always thought the finish of the great duet in the Huguenots the
most dramatic piece of business of its kind on the lyric stage; but
what is one to think now? Look here; (Siegfried and Fafner still
at it).
“Iſe places himself opposite Fafner, who lifts himself further for:
ward on to the high-ground, and spits at him with his nostrils,”
(with a pretty motive that ought to be very effective). “Siegfried
springs aside. Fafner swings forward his tail to catch Siegfried,
who apoids it by leaping over the back of the Worm ; as the tail
quickly follows and almost seizes him, Siegfried wounds it with his
sword. Fafuer quickly withdraws his tail” (safe laugh), “roars,”
(another lead for the house), “and lifts the fore-part of his body, in
order to throw himself towards the side with his full weight upon
Siegfried: he thus exposes to him his breast: Siegfried quickly
discovers the place of his heart,” (a sort of lyric diagnosis? TBetter
have, it chalked first), “and plunges his sword into it, up to the
hilt.” . That settles Fafner, but not the duet; for he has still a
very nice bit of ensemble, though “with weaker voice,” which is
reasonable, before he finally expires.. I certainly look forward to
this immensely, for though I saw all the pantomimes last Christmas,
I’m quite certain there was nothing in any one of 'em that could
come anywhere near it.
Then in the Götterdämmerung there’s a wedding, and, I suppose,
a breakfast, which probably accounts for Gunter *... the cast.
I hope, however, I shan’t finish up by quoting to the great com-
oser and poet, the neat speech of his own Mime, translated by
s own FoEMAN, who says to somebody or other “very irritably,”
“Wildering nonsense
Now are thy words!”
ONLY ONE BILLINGSGATE.
ONE cannot help having a kind of sneaking kindness for what
CHARLEs DICKENs called, “That very terrible body the Court of
Common Council.” They do occasionally act in such a wonderfully
droll, old-fashioned sort of way, as if they really believed that
things were exactly as they were hundreds o years ago.
For instance now, they have managed to preserve with loving
care an old Charter, granted to them five hundred 3. ago by
Edward THE THIRD, of money-loving memory, doubtless for
certain weighty considerations, in which charter it is solemnly
stated there shall be no more Markets within seven miles of the City!
This, perhaps, was of no very great importance some five centuries
ago, when the whole kingdom contained fewer people than the
Metropolis does now. But the funny part of the matter is, that the
City Sages actually try to persuade themselves—they certainly will
not persuade anybody else—that this monstrous enactment should
be continued, although the º has increased tenfold.
There is, as most people know, a Market of ill repute in more
respects than one, ed Billingsgate. It is the only wholesale Fish
Market for the whole Metropolis. The irate Salesman whose letter
we were unable to insert last week on account of its powerful lan-
guage, asks, with indignation, “How long are we to be confined to
this wretched hole, where such scenes of confusion and muddle are
enacted as can never be believed unless seen P” The Railway
Managers say that their vans are delayed upon an average four
hours, thereby not only wasting time and money, but thoroughly
demoralising their men. The approach by water is so bad that all
the packages of fish have to be carried from the vessels on men's
backs; and, to crown all, the principal carriers of water-borne fish
state before Parliament that with increased facilities they could
enormously increase the supply.
To remedy this frightful muddle, it is proposed to erect a large
commodious market at Shadwell; and whose is the sole opposition
the promoters have to encounter #
ould it not be utterly incredible if we did not know it to be true,
that the sole opposition is that of the Corporation with their curious
old Charter, which ought long ere this to have been placed among
the other curiosities of their interesting Museum.
Of course, the House of Commons Committee made short work of
the Charter business, and passed the Bill as necessary for the proper
supply of fish to the East of London. - -
ut now comes the most comical part of the business. Havin
utterly failed to convince the House of Commons, that, this ol
curiosity in the charter line was of more importance than the supply
of food to the one and a half million of the East of London, they
actually, on Wednesday, by a majority of One, determined to try
their luck in the House of Lords!
What a compliment to the acuteness, and common sense and
patriotism of their Lordships 1 - --
However, though the Corporation may be inclined to say, “Thank
God, we have a House of Lords !” when they think they can appeal
to their prejudices, the poor people of the East of London may repeat
the exclamation, in full confidence, that they may safely leave their
case to their Lordships' sympathy and patriotism.
THose “Half-Holiday Handbooks” are very useful, though per-
haps not sufficiently portable. But why not “Whole-Holiday
Pocket-Books,” showing where to go, when to go, and how to go it?
If Mr. FISHER UNWTN doesn't look sharp, we shall have this series
out ourselves about Whitsuntide.

A MODERN PASTEUR-AL,
I HAVE found out the germs in the air,
I have learned where the bacilli breed;
The parasite-world, I’ve laid bare
A detestable kingdom, indeed.
Vitality's lowest abyss,
I have plumbed in pursuitof my “germs,”
hose unpleasantness mortals may miss,
In the darkness of technical terms.
I have watched all the things that ferment,
I have sat at decay's vampire feast,
I can scarcely convey the extent
Of my knowledge of “mould,” and of yeast.
To suffering man I impart
Information of comfort and cheer;
I can help devotees of high art,
And the makers of wine or small beer.
I know every parasite pest,
I can draw it in section and plan;
And explain if the nuisance infest
The bodies or vineyards of man.
I could show you most hideous things,
But that is not Science's scope:
She doesn’t shriek horrors, but sings
The practical poems of hope.
Her object is lengthening life,
And giving humanity ease;
Her pryings and porings mean strife
With the powers of death and disease.
Those powers that lurk in the dark,
That skulk in the realms beyond sight,
It is Science's business to mark
It is Science's pleasure to fight.
Wast vistas expand to her view
But she may not dally with dreams ;
She must trace out the tracks of the true
All heedless of phantasy's gleams.

And that they are preparing for flight
Who first are contented to plod.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
Extracted FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Monday Night, April 24,-Air full of rumours of new Baronets.
In fact, as Sir CHARLEs ForsTER says, instead of calling this the
Budget night, it's the Barry'nite. According to rumour, almost
everyone has got a lift. Look naturally for the name of John
PENDER. If Baronetcies are to be given for public services, surely
the man who has put half-a-dozen girdles round the earth should
be hailed “Sir John.” But don't find him in this list. Perhaps
there's a second edition reserved for men who have done substantial
Service,
There are Members who respectfully address me, as “Sir Toby.”
That also premature. Since I heard of these things coming on,
called to mind PETER’s procedure when
the new Ministry was formed. Shut him-
self up. . Remained at home in the expecta-
s tion of being sent for. No use me going
home, since here's the fount, of honour
sitting on the Treasury Bench, having just
made his Budget Speech. Casually walked
once or twice between the Treasury Bench
and the Table, so as to give him the oppor-
tunity of mentioning any little matter he
lad of it. These titl h º; ... **
glad of 1U. ese titles are empty things. s the t says, “
breath may blow them, so a breath be blowed.” dº. and
myself will remain plain “Mr.”
But there's Joseph G.ILL.Is. Seems no doubt that henceforward we
shall have to be more respectful to him. Sir Joseph GILLIs BIGGAR,
Bart., of Porkchops House, in the County of Cavan, isn't to be trifled
with. This, it is said, is to be the last attempt to solve the Irish
question,
“Let’s have Joseph G.H.LIs on our side,” BRIGHT said at the last
Cabinet Council, “and all will be well.” Joey B. is reported to
have been rather coy at first. Said, he thought Mr. Healy would
ºut him–Mr. HEALY, whose proud reflection, is that he doesn't
know what a Prince is like, wouldn't recognise it if he saw it;
Pointed out to Joseph that there is a difference between a Royal
Prince, and what J. B. calls “a Barn't.” This was, however, only
his slyness. Fact is he sº at offer. Expect there’ll be a deal
of trouble with him. Says he's going to sit above the Gangway
now. He's not proud, he protests. $º: something is due to his
rank. Has given notice to ARTHUR Q'CoNNoR that he must get
some one else to give him a lift home in a cab when the House sits
late. Qr Sir Joseph says, if there is no other Member going, that
§ they will have a four-wheeler, and O'Connor shall ride on
e Dox.
All this very dreadful. Afraid our Joseph G.ILL.Is is for ever
lost to us. Will take an opportunity, on going into Committee of
i. of saying a few words on the enervating influence of Royal
avour.
Business done.—Joseph G.ILL.Is made Barn't. Budget brought in.
Tuesday.—The Conservative party and the country had better keep
their eye on STANLEY LEIGHTon. There is in him
the making of a great, orator. ... At present a little

Business done.-Budget Resolution agreed to.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Wonderfully clever speech from GLAD-
sron E. None of your ordinary kind, where a man tries to let you
know what’s in his mind. Anyone can do that with more or less
success. Great point about, WEG's speech was that being on his
feet thirty-five minutes talking with full flow of language, in

Whole passages barricaded with conditions, and honeycombed with
subjunctives.
“Letting I will not wait upon I won't,

as SHAKspeARE somewhere hath it. Interesting to watch the
countenances of Members intently listening. Any one who has
seen a gentleman on the sunny shores of

catching mosquitos, may gather a general
impression. Now they had his meaning.
Now they hadn't. Here it was, and there
- it certainly is. Just as you can hear the
- whizz of the mosquito, which makes more
\ºs gravating the quest, they could, catch
glimpses of WEG's meaning. Could hear
its whizz, as it were, all through the half-
- hour. But at the end hadn't got the mos-
quito. And he looked so innocent, too—so anxious that he should be
comprehended, and that not a shade of his meaning should be lost!
This completed the joy of the afternoon, and made GEORGIE HAMILTON
more than usually wild.
Business done.-New Land Bill brought in by Land League.
Guaranteed to settle Ireland for at least seven weeks.
Thursday Night.—Most people away at Windsor marrying and
iving in marriage. Mr. CHARLEs LEWIS and Mr. PHILIP CALLAN
ivided between them the earlier hours of the sitting.

high opinion of the British Parliament. Someone has
been ºf something about Mr. CALLAN in the news-
papers. His sensitive mind naturally hurt. So he
comes down and tells Dr. CAMERON (whom he
“reasonably suspects” of being the author of the
paragraph) that he is in the pay of the Government, P ºm
and in consideration of getting for his paper a few “” ”
advertisements per annum, does as he is bidden. Dr. CAMERON talks
about Mr. CALLAN’s “fragile honour.” Mr. HEALY shocked at this
rude speech. Dr. CAMERON withdraws, firing a parting shot abºut
appealing from “PHILIP drunk to PHILIP sober.” A hit, a palpable
hit. Only these pot-house brawls don't raise the House in the esti-
mation of the intelligent foreigner in the gallery.
Business done.—Corrupt Practices Bill read a Second Time.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
FIRST, Odette is not an Irish piece, though The O' Debt would
have troubled himself to go to M. SARD0U for this play, since he
could have . a far better one turned out for him by any English
Dramatist who might not be above ; on M. SARDOU's sartorian
motto of “Gents' own materials carefully made up.” For Odette
recalls to the playgoer's mind Fiammina (anglicised long ago by
PALGRAVE SIMPson as Broken Ties) Fernande, Le Feu au Couvent,
La Clé, Les Grands Enfants, and one or two others. Such a mixture
doesn't say much for M. SARDou's originality, but a great deal for
his ingenuity. Perhaps, too, if the great man has condescended to
study English, he may some years ago have read Mr. A'BECKETT's
Magazine Story, of which a successful dramatic version has been
recently produced at the Royalty.
The spark of interest awakened in the First Act fizzles out before
the third is over; in the fourth, a galvanic shock would be required
to arouse the audience, and as there is nothing in the dialogue,
even when given intelligibly by two of the principals, and nothing
in the situations or in the acting to electrify anybody, the audience
is not shocked-though it stood a good chance of being so occasion-
ally,–by the dramatist's spasmodic attempts to enlist their sympa-
thies for the wrong person.
ACT I –Opening; French servants playing cards, and talking un:
intelligibly. Énglish servant trying to get a laugh by yawning and
failing. Mdme. MoDJEsKA as Odette, or Lady Henry Treverne, asks
a few friends in to tea—“she always came home to tea’’—“after
the Opera is over.” Uninteresting conversation relieved by her
reading a message from her husband, and the friends are dismissed.
She stealthily unlatches a side-door, and exit to bed. Her
husband unexpectedly returns with his brother, Lord Arthur
and brings back one of the tea-party, Philip Eden, whom he had
met on the door-step. Suddenly Lord Henry hears a step in the
assage outside the unlocked door, whereat three men start and
come apparently panic-stricken.
“The door is unlocked l’’, exclaims the horrified Lord Henry
BANCROFT ; “that door, too, which I had always told 'em most par-
ticularly to keep fastened.”
Why had he given these orders?... “Is it the jam-cupboard?” the
audience ask themselves, and has his little daughter Eva (alluded to
reviously as being. unwell) been getting at the sweets? Why
oesn’t the stupid idiot open the door and see who it is P. No one
suggests this very natural expedient. No, the three nervous men are
too paralysed with fear to suggest anything; they have lost their
heads; and the situation, which one touch of intelligent stage-
management might have made reasonable, is simply ridiculous.
Enter, through the jam-cupboard, Prince Troubitzkoy, a Russian
Slyboots, who is Odette's lover. This very risky part was cautiously
layed by Mr. SMEDLEY. His sneaking in, and his sneaking out after
ing caught by Lord Henry, were two of the best bits in the piece;
for it is a piece in “bits,” and the good bits are badly put together,
Qdette's faithlessness having been proved, Lord #. as his
child conveyed to Lord Arthur's room, and then, with a playful
reminiscence of his boyhood's happier years, about Christmas time,
he hides behind his wife's door, receding as she opens it (like the
immortal Mr. Pickwick in the den of the boarding-school),
but, not lying down so as to trip her up on the threshold-(a cul-
pable omission on his part—and yet they call this piece carefully
rehearsed 1)—and then, as she stretches out her hand to welcome
Troubitzkoy (who has long ago
disappeared into the recesses
of the mysterious jam-cup-
board—but without the usual
business of smashing the crock-
ery), Lord, Henry
seizes her, she turns
towards him, he turns
on her, scream, whoop

gible and admirable.
“You are still my

Henry, finishing a

dull but hi ghly conscientious tirade against divorce; “but out you
go. Allez.
...To which Odette's reply—there is a great deal of French spoken
in the piece—would naturally be, “Allez-vous promener! I don't
budge a step. Consult a solicitor!” And Lord Henry would have
bad to telegraph off to his solicitor in London—fetching him out
certainly sound suggestive of No Rent. Mr. BANCROFT need not | *

ow her to see her child—and so Eva becomes to Odette “the girl
I left behind me.”–and exit Lady Henry after shrieking out,
Läche ''' at her husband, which unparliamentary expression quite
shuts up the unhappy Lord Henry, and Mr. BANCROFT collapses, in
8. .# like a fantoccini doll with its strings broken. End of Act.
Considerable applause from the Gallery consequent upon Mdme.
MoDJESKA having been understood to say, “Lush ' ' which, whether
considered from a temperange or intemperance point of view, was
advice that exactly coincided with the intentions of the majority at
that moment, at least such was the explanation of the plaudits
given by an eminent scholar to whose authority we bow.

ACT III.-Gambling Saloon. [Fernande and
La Clé.]. Reminds us of Act II., Artful Cards,
only without Mr. Toole and the trombone.
Mr. PINERo's imitation of Mr. Edward TERRY

rated. He looked, on the first
night, as if he had mistaken the
piece for a Burlesque, and had
made up accordingly. The mis-

coupled with the curiosity of the audience to know what Mdme. MoD-

of what, after all said and done, must be pronounced a wearisome Act.
ACT IV.-Odette meets the girl she left behind her, who plays
to her a cheerful composition on the organ, of which her father is,
she says, very fond, a fact that speaks º for his taste, as the
air, being hopelessl dull, must, of, course, be strictly classical;

MARLBoRough STREET-Forty young ladies wereto-day charged at
this court with obstructing the traffic in Bond Street, and with
repeated attempted robberies. The Archbishop of CANTERBURY
deposed that as he was walking down Maddox Street, he felt a tug at
his chain, and, on looking, discovered that his watch was gone. He
immediately seized the prisoner, a rescue of whom was attempted b
her companions now in the dock. Mr. JoHN HoHLINGSHEAD, said,
that at the present moment he was producing a piece at the Gaiety
Theatre entitled The Forty. Thieves, and taking a leaf. out of his
friend, Mr. WYNDHAM's book, had determined to advertise it in the
latest fashion. The prisoners were remanded.
CLERKENWELL-Messrs A, and S. GATTI were charged here to-day
with an attempt to blow up the House of Correction. The prisoners
said in their defence, that they were now playing a piece entitled
Taken From Life, at the Adelphi Theatre, in which the great sensa-
tion was the blowing up of the Clerkenwell Prison. Their conduct
was merely for the purposes of advertisement. They were remanded.
Bow STREET.-Messrs. HARE and KENDAL, who refused to give
their Christian names or initials, were charged with stealing a book
off a stall in Holywell Street. The prisoner; in answer to the charge,
handed the Magistrate a document signed “HARE and KENDAL.” in
which they called his attention to the controversy which had existed
in the theatrical papers over the Pinerosation of Far from the
Madding Crowd., Inasmuch as public interest in The Squire was
flagging, they had thought that a little genuine advertisement might
possibly revive it. The prisoners were remanded.

You are virtuous; you

not be too careful in
concealing every trace
of these two latter
qualities. To ham-

As long as you do so, the English people will not, seemingly, take much
notice of your acts; but if you were to carry out any of your threats
of blowing up English gaols or other buildings, I fear it would cause
measures to be adopted which you would find very inconvenient.
In electing your representatives to the alien Parliament, be careful
to exclude for the future anyone who is likely to show in the House
the ordinary courtesies and decencies of civilised life. If you could

“The subject of his thesis

Should Dr. GERMAN TE

No. VI.-SAMMY AND THE ST. BERNARD.
SAMMY was staying with his parents at the Hospice of the Great
St. Bernard. There was more snow about than usual, and he heard
the Monks say it would be
a bad time for the dogs.
So he rose early one morn-
ing, and taking his father's
brandy-flask with him—
his worthy progenitor was
still slumbering—he went
forth for a walk. The
snow was very deep, he
had great difficulty in
keeping the path. Ine-

His perseverance was presently rewarded. He saw the footmarks
of a large dog,and he followed the track. At last they disappeared
*::::::: and he was at fault. Quite haphazard, he struck his
Alpenstock into a freshly-fallen heap of snow." It went down like a
spear, and from the noise that followed, it had evidently penetrated
a sensitive body. To go down on his hands and knees and scratch
away at the snow as if he were mad, was the work of a moment.
After scratching in this manner for half an hour, he was rewarded
§. coming upon the body of Barry, one of the finest dogs in the
onastery, apparently dead. - - - -
He put his hand on the dog's heart and found it still pulsating
slowly. Putting his pocket-knife between the jaws, he opened the
dog's mouth as he would an oyster. In a second he had emptied the
contents of the paternal flask down his patient's throat. The dog was
saved, but he could not walk. He got up, he fell down, he rolled over
and over in the snow. At last the courageous SAMMY, seeing Barry
was dropping, off into a fatal sleep, put his two fore-paws over his
shoulders, and literally º the gigantic beast all the way to the
Hospice. At the door he fell down exhausted, and Barry, who by
this time had somewhat recovered, when the Monks came out
§. his tail, looked benevolent, and pretended he had rescued
the boy.

“Art supported by Science and Faith.”
ONE FOR WATKIN.
If Sir Edward WATKIN had desired to furnish an argument in
favour of his Channel Tunnel scheme, he could not have done
better than by exhibiting the bad --
management of the service of
Channel Steamers in connection
with the South-Eastern Rail-
way. On one day last week the
whole of the passengers of a
certain train from Paris to Bou-
logne should have proceeded to
Folkestone in a fine boat, the
Albert Victor, but the Duke and -
Duchess of EDINBURGH, with
eight attendants, were in the train, and to these ten people the
steamer was assigned, while the unfortunate passengers were, as one
paper says, packed into a “crazy tub,” and had not been long on
board before a cylinder-pipe burst, and but for the presence of
mind of an engineer, she would have gone to the bottom. As it was,
she drifted helplessly for sixteen hours on a rough sea, with no con-
veniences and hardly anything to eat, until at last she was rescued,
and the unhappy passengers released.
This is the account of Mr. St. GeoRGE MIVART, an eminent man
of science; and it is answered by Sir Edward WATRIN, in a fine
confused statement, which in no way shakes the savant's testimony.
The boat which came to grief is called by Sir Edward a steamer of
the “old type,” a euphemism for “crazy tub,” which reflects credit
on that ingenious orator. It is certainly a disgraceful business;
and Punch is sure that no one will feel more angry than the Duke
of EDINBURGH, and his kindly Duchess, that an act of snobbish
sycophancy to themselves should have placed three hundred fellow-
creatures in imminent danger.

which, in case of his death, would come to me. Why should a
BRowN possess wealth which I, a SMITH, am forbidden to enjoy P

oad of gun-cotton.

April 11.-Found in the Newgate Calendar that in 1792 there was
a SMITH who committed murder. Evidently homicidal mania is
hereditary with me. Mem.—Might call on Mr. CHARLEs READE and
dance wildly in his hall. He’ll note down the fact in his uncom-
mon-place book for future use.
April 12.-Read of a SMITH in Crackskull on Insanity, whose
peculiar form of madness puzzled the leading doctors of the earlier
part of this century. Plainly an ancestor of mine. Take first op-
portunity of making American acquaintances. Have heard there
was a SMITH who helped CoIUMBUs to discover America. He must
have been as mad as a Hatter. By the way, have just found out
that an ancestor of mine was a Hatter | |
April 14.—Curious case in the paper of a robbery, accompanied by

NOTES FROM OUR OPERA-BUFFER.
Boccaccio at the Comedy Theatre is as well done as it can be.
The spectacle is brilliant; the dialogue and music are not. Mr.
BRough is, as usual, funny; and he has one good
line that .. down the house; but the house
once brought down, there is very little strength
in this Comic Opera to pull it up again. It is a
decided mistake to produce a Comic Opera as
“new,” when the London public has previously
made the acquaintance of the majority of the
tunes at the "Gaiety and the Alhambra. The
scenery is charming; the orchestra good, but too
loud throughout ; and when, oh, when shall we
see some little variety in the stage-management
of the young chorus-ladies?. Pretty, all of them,
jºiſ; the two flower-girls; but things of
beauty become bores for ever, if their actions
are monotonous. We are tired of their perpetual
advances,<-very nice of them to make advances
now and then, of course, but every advance has
its drawback; of their wagging their heads from
side to side. of the marionette-like action of the
hands, of their polka steps, waltz steps, and
marking time to the symphonies, of all this we
Boccaccio's De-
(Violet)-Cameron. are weary.
Mr. KELLEHER's forced laugh is a nuisance,
except once in his song when it is funny. We, don't suppose that
a very long cadenza is in store for, Boccaccio, though probably the
English version is far livelier than the original Parisian one.
Lord Bateman—performed at a Gaiety Matinée—is the best piece,
far and away, that Messrs. STEPHEN and SoLoMons—no, we mean
Śrepress and soºoºon have yet done. With a little pruning,
and more rehearsal, it will be a big success.
Miss St. QUINTEN, ever bright and gladsome, was made to sing a
lovely melody, “I followed the Silver Line,” three times. ... Mr.
AYNSLEY CookE, who was very good, had twice to sing “Calipash
and Calipee.” Mr. CookE, Mr. ARTHUR WILLIAMs, Mr. DARRELL,
and Mr. Royce—whose misfortune all must sympathise with—were
made to sing the “Family Lot', twice; Mr. DARRELL is not the best
tenor in the world, which is lucky for him, as he might be singing,
“Oh, Red, Red Rose, oh, Rose so White ” till now ; and, above
all, the chorus of Blue-Coat Boys, the prettiest conception that
modern English Opera has produced, and which alone would insure
a piece's success, was received with, literally, rapturous applause,
thanks to Mr. STEPHENs' idea, Mr. Solomon's music, and }. ad-
mirable (manner in which the chorusses at the Gaiety Theatre are
always, sung. We hope to see something more of it, and say
something more about it, on the first Comic Opera-tunity.

in at Wel.
Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT in very restless mood to-night., Been over
to the House of Lords several times, and moodily pacing the corridor
with fingers caressing chin. Rumours about of several resignations
and Fº vacancies in high places.
“You’d look well on the Woolsack, WERNoN,” I said to him,
meeting him in the Lords' Corridor.
“No, Toby,” he said, “I am not worthy of so high a distinction,
It is possible my figure would lend itself with effect to the graceful
folds of the gown; I know a wig suits me; also I should like to be
within speaking distance of SALISBURY. Moreover, I am deeply
learned in the law, and have a judicial mind. These little things
seem to pick me out from the common herd. But the place is too
high for me, Toby, Perhaps natural tendency to underrate my
capacity stands in the way of my advancement. Still I feel it is not
for me to preside over the sittings of these great and good men.”
WERNoN was visibly affected, I wrung his hand and left him.
Ibusiness done.—One Amendment to First Resolution of Procedure
disposed of. 107 remain.
Tuesday Night.—A constant wave of excitement fills the House at
four o'clock.__A whisper runs along the Benches, through the lobbies,
across the News-Room, and adown the
Iibrary, that GLADSTONE may be up at
any moment, and that presently we shall
know all about it. Members rushin, filling
the erewhile empty House like the tide
returning. Wigan and its writ whipped
out in great haste. The Benches fill up as
if by magic. The tide rises so high as to
fill up the side Galleries. The Peers, never
excited in own House, climb into the

ADWERTISING PICTURE GALLERIES.
A REMARKABLE addition has lately been made to the numberless
Works of Art exhibited on the spare walls and hoardings, serving
to ºm the mind, delight the eye, and cultivate the taste of the
eople.
..This is the life-sized Cartoon of a Sandwich Man, a tatterdemalion
situated between two placard-boards advertising a fancy soap. . His
hat is battered, his raiment patched and, torn, with a leg of his
trousers out at the knee. There is humour in the idea of an example
of the Great Unwashed employed to recommend a material for
ablution.
Another production of artistic and advertising ingenuity designed
also to popularise a peculiar soap, is the counterfeit presentment of
a face and part figure of huge dimensions, got up in ecclesiastical
attire, with a black skull-cap on, and being intended, apparently, to
represent a French Abbé. He has lathered the under half of his
visage all over; and, with distended cheeks wearing an expression of
fatuous geniality, appears nearly bursting with laughter in th
delightful consciousness of being ridiculous, and the enjoyment
“ºf himself to derision. -

A HANDBOOK TO KNOWLEDGE.
- No. I.--THE GROWLER,
Q. What is a Cabº
4. A. A. Cab is a wheeled vehicle contrived for, the purpose of conveying
“fares” for small distances, at the slowest possible speed, with the greatest
possible discomfort.
Q. What are “fares”?
A. Persons condemned to travel in Cabs are so called.
Q. Why? -
A. By a figure of speech. The “fare” is really the charge for the hire of
the vehicle, which, being the sole object of interest to the driver, is by him
naº identified with the victim who pays it.
Q. How many kinds of Cabs are there P
4. Two: the four-wheeler and the Hansom.
Q. Describe a four-wheeler.
A, Briefly, it is a confined cubical box upon four noisy wheels, with twº seats,
which are invariably uncomfortable, and two windows which always rattle.
3. It not a four-wheeler also called a “Growler”?
. It 18.
Q. Why is this name applied to it?
A. In delicate reference, first to the rumbling roar, which accompanies its
rºº and secondly to the grumbling grumpiness of the man who drives it.
. What internal accommodation does a four-wheeler afford P
A. None. It, however, holds four passengers, in the sense in which a sardine
box holds its contents.
Q. What cantº: tell me respecting its means of entrance and exit?
A. It is difficult to get into a four-wheeler. It is almost impossible to get
out of one,
3. }. is this?
.4. There are many reasons. Its doors always jam, its handles invariabl
stick. If the handles yield, they do so with a jerk which hurts your É.
If the doors open, it is with a burst which destroys your balance, and probably
depºsits.you in, the gutter. When you have entered, it needs repeated and
violent bangs” on the part of the driver to shut you in, with an effect upon
you like the explosion of fog-signals under your coat-collar. The driver
generally accompanies his lunges, with a choice assoºt-
ment of professional expletives, which add greatly to the
effect of the operation, especially upon Ladies. .
Q. What are the further peculiarities of this singular
vehicle?
A. They may be summarised as consisting in nastiness
and noise.
Q. Explain this.
A. A cab interior is unpleasant to all the senses. It
is always stuffy and generally foetid. Its odour is ºut
generis and indescribable, but it compares unfavourably
with that of a rag-shop or a vault. As it is entirely
unlighted, you cannot see anything, even the time, by
your watch. Nor canyou hear anything, save the rumbling
of ill-hung wheels .# the rattle of badly-fitting windows.
Conversation in a Cab is therefore impossible, unless you
have the voice of a fog-horn or of the doorkeeper, at
Lloyd's, You can, however, feel a great deal—notably
the hardness and slippery slantingness of the seats, the
nerve-torturing jar of continuous vibration, the bone-
shaking jolts and oscillations, and the shocks of collision
with the elbows and knees of your fellow-travellers.
Q. And how do you communicate with the driver?
A. You cannot do so to any practical effect, unless
you combine unusual vocal powers with rare acrºbatic
skill and practised adroitness in the use of the umbrella
or walking-stick as a prod or goad.
Q. How are these necessary accomplishments to be
acquired? -
A. Only—if at all—by long, painful, and expensive
“training”—in Cabs. When you are able to hang half
out of a window without falling out wholly, and to talk
intelligibly round a corner, like a Punch doll, in, the
midst of huge clatter, to a stupid or sullen “Cabby.”

THINGS TO BE LIVED DOWN.
Distinguished Amateur (much pleased with himself as the Wicked Marquess). “PHEw ! WELL, I wasn't so very BAD, OLD MAN, was I ?”
Author (Prompter, Stage Manager, dºc.). “WELL, MY DEAR FELLow, I Don't ExACTLY KNow How BAD You can BE "
FROM OUR OWN COASTGUARDSMAN.
RAMSGATE, as everyone ought to know, if they are not already
acquainted with the fact, is one of the best and the healthiest places
on our coast; but its two main thoroughfares are about the most
inconvenient and awkward for even moderate traffic that can be
found in any town of equal importance. Given an extra cart or so,
a truck, or a waggon delivering goods, and woe be to the unlucky
person with luggage in a fly, anxious to catch the L. C. and D. train.
Already the Improvement Commissioners have been at work, and
some good has been effected. But, according to the account in the
Thanet Advertiser for May 6, the proceedings of the Commissioners
do not *: to be harmonious.
A Mr. WYE had risen to explain something—to give them, in fact,
“the reason Wye”—when he was “ruled out of order,” and—
-“then most vociferously shouted and howled down, seven or eight mem-
bers being on their legs at one and the same time, endeavouring to be heard.
In vain did Mr.TURPIN appeal, in vain did one or more members with
ringing voices call “Chair, chair!” . . . The row went on. . . . Amidst this
tremendous uproar, finding that all efforts to restore order were unavailing,
the Chairman abruptly left the chair, and declared the meeting adjourned.”
It is very jº. as bad as a “Scene in the House,” or at an East-
End-of-London ...; Meeting. And all this when the discussion
was, to paraphrase Mr. Sam Weller's son, about
The widening of the road-er,
When the Chairman says, “Sure as eggs is eggs
I am the bold TuR-PIN.”
And “the bold TUR-PIN,” he’ll have to be for some time to
gome, only we, do hope the street improvements of what might be
the most pºpular of our sea-side resorts will not come to a standstill
while the Commissioners are improving themselves.
From the same jº. we learn that in the tremendous gale of
April 30th, the Calais-Douvres was only a few minutes beyond its
usual time in coming from the French coast. This is another nasty
one for Sir WATHIN's Tunnel, for over the sea must be preferable to
under it, if the time of transit be the same, and the chance of mai
de mer be reduced to a minimum.
-
FAREWELL TO ERIN.
AIR-‘‘Though the last Glimpse of Erin with Sorrow I see.”
Ex-Chief Secretary sings —
THOUGH the last glimpse of Erin with gladness I see,
Yet, Erin, thou hast not dealt § Ine.
Driven forth from thy bosom, I'm glad to get home,

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
MODERN LIFE IN LONDON ;
T II
It was a fine morning at the end of April when the CoRINTHIAN
observed to his Coz that young Bob was coming that afternoon to
take them to the private view of the GRosvenoR GALLERY. “The
ACADEMY it appears, my dear JERRY, is to use young Bob's expres:
sion played out, indeed it has been called the charnel house of dead
reputations, but the tip-tops in the painting line, the élite in the
orld of Art send their pictures to the GRosvenoR which is managed
by the fashionable APELLEs of the period, SIR CouTTS LINDSAY,
and his able Lieutenant, Mr. CoMYNs CARR, a gentleman who I am
told has a pretty knack of dramatic authorship, and can beat Mr. W.
SHAKESPEARE, late of Stratford-upon-Avon “into fits.’” “I am
most eager, my dear ToM,” said JERRY, “to behold the GROSVENOR
GALLERY, for I am told it is also the Haunt of Beauty, and of a new
set of people who have sprung up since our day, and who are called
AESTHETEs.” “Yes, indeed,” returned the CoRINTHIAN, “Many
things have changed since we mixed with the goEs, and LIFE IN
LoNDON is in truth a Kaleidoscope.
Our heroes were thus impatient for the appearance of young BoB,
who came in gorgeous apparel, and said º: didn’t care for the
pictures don't you know, but it was “the thing” to do the GROSVENQR
once in the season. So the TRIo departed, and soon arrived at the
rendezvous. There was an awning over the door and a great Crowd
of º many of them with Coronets upon them, so that it was
evident the beau monde patronised THE GRosy ENoR. The staircase
was gay with flowers, and when they entered the galleries the Crush
was enormous. “We are ‘out of the hunt,' my dear Bob,” said ToM,
“so you must point out the notabilities, the dandies and the ladies
of the highest fashion.” “With pleasure,” said young LOGIC.
“There goes the PREMIER forgetful of the House, there an %.
leader, and yonder is the Presiding Genius of the place, LADY LINDSAY
of BALCARREs. “Who is that burly man,” said JERRY, “in a white
waistcoat and red tie, who #. would be good at a set-to, and
looks as if he had seen ‘ cities and men.’” P “That,” said young BoB,
“is a famous critic and journalist, and he has indeed seen the
* Streets of the World,” been “Twice round the Clock,” made “a
Journey due North’ in company with “The Seven Sons of Mammon,'
known "Paris Revisited,’ and illuminated the ‘Echoes of the Week’
with a great amount of Gºjº” to and jºbſº gazed with great
interest at this gentleman, who nodded genially to young LQGIC and
said he was just going to lunch—“to capture,” as he playfully re-
marked “the Phantom Cutlet.” “Who, dear Bob,” said CorINTHIAN
ToM, “is that little man, with an eye-glass, talking and gesticu-
lating very yolubly”?. “That,” said young 'Boº, “is an American
artist, a painter of what he calls “Nocturnes,’ ‘Symphonies,’ and
‘Scherzos, there are one or two of them here, canvasses painted blue
all over with dabs of yellow on them. I don't profess to understand
THE “NExT of KIN FRAUDs.”—Cozenage.
“Cousins indeed; and by their uncle cozened.”
Queen Elizabeth, in “Richard the Third.”
The chance of being cozened by your Uncle is Two-to-One! So,
mind how you spout SHAKSPEARE.

'em myself, but I’m told they’re extremely chic.” “Ah,” said the
CoRINTHIAN, meditatively, looking at one of these, “there certainly
is what you would call, my dear LoGIC, a good deal of ‘cheek’ about
them.” Young Bob laughed, and said he thought the artist put on a
good deal of “side,” and then he pointed out one or two painters of the
AEsthetic School, and a great poet in whose honour a society had been
founded to explain his verses which were “caviare to the general.”
Then the Trio took a stroll in the galleries, and had a look at the
pictures, just as in the old days ToM and JERRY laid out a bob well,
as the Oronian said, at the Exhibition of Pictures at Somerset House.
Here, at the GRosweNoR, Royalty was a contributor, and a portrait
by the Princess Louise was hugely admired by the connoisseurs.
There were works too by Count GLEICHEN, Sir CouTTs and Lady
LINDSAY, Sir F. LEIGHToN, Messrs. MILLAIs, BURNE-Jon ES, ALMA-
TADEMA, KEELEY - HALswellE, LEGR0s, PELEGRINI, PRINSEP
STUART-WoRTLEY, RIDLEY, PADGETT, and others, which all receive
their meed of admiration, while the pictures by Mrs. Louise Jop-
LING were pronounced by the CoRINTHIAN, who was a fine judge, to be
the ne plus ultra of painting, and he said that she must be a lady of
high accomplishments. Thus they had a lounge º; the saloons,
and listened to the remarks of soi-disant critics and the fashionable
babble that went on upon all sides from the votaries of Art and
Pleasure that thronged the Gallery. -
The pictures were º with much interest, and the Ladies
then claimed attention, and “Who,” cried the CoRINTHIAN, “are
these extraordinary beings with strange hats and dresses of blue,
yellow, and sickly green, who look limp and forlorn ?”. “Those,'
replied young Bois, “are asthetic young ladies, who sigh for Sun-
FIowers, languish over LILIFs, and peruse improper PoEMs. The
coteries to which they belong have been satirized in a play called The
Colonel, where you may see these queer dresses accurately repro-
duced. A musical absurdity called Patience has also dealt with
them, but the costumes of that are exaggerations, and cannot be
ronounced truly aesthetic.” “Inever heard of aesthetic people,” said
oM, “but they are certainly Characters; and I suppose the {.
sea, have not a monopoly of this new fancy, for I see some melan-
choly young men among them who look as if they had been ‘badly
WaS º and then hung up to dry.” “That may be,” said BQB, “but
they say they are “utter,” and so they are—utter frauds.”. At which
sally TöM and JERRY laughed, and the latter remarked that young
Bofi was “his father's son,” for the Ozonian would have been highly
amused at the male and female AESTHETEs. , “That is quite true,
Coz,” said the CoRINTHIAN, “and I marvel, how long this strange
fashion will last. These are certainly incidents in the Chapter of
Caricatures, and we shall not readily forget the rich scenes at the
Private View of the GRosvenoR GALLERY.”
-
At a fashionable Fancy Dress Ball the other night was danced a
“costume quadrille” arranged, with dresses designed by, an emi-
nent Royal Academician, “to represent the twelve months of the
year.” “Ah!” exclaimed Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM, on hearing this,
“Now I understand what they mean by ‘reviving ALMANACR's.’’

BURTON,
REMARKABLE ROMANCES.
(By a Rambler.)
No. IV.-THE JEUNE PREMIER.
He was a sweet youth, and developed early in life a taste for shiny
boots, eighteenpenny “º and diamond studs. If LANCELot
-- AMBKIN (for such were his names) had
had the money, I doubt not but that he
would have paid for some of these neces-
sities, but having barely sufficient income
for the satisfying of hansom cabmen and
club waiters, he wisely, left the boots,
cigars, and studs to be entered on the cre-
dit columns of those tradesmen whom he
favoured with his confidence and patronage.
He had a decided antipathy to work, but
it cannot be said that he was without
talent, for he invented a new varnish for
º: leather which would cost no more
er bottle) than five and elevenpence
three farthings; and he it was who founded
that celebrated Club, the Genial Gommies.
“Something Bohemian dontcherknow,” he
explained, as the aim, and object of the
- Association. But when his boon companion,
little ToMMY Ports, asked where Bohemia was situated, LAMPRIN
loftil - replied, “Oh, somewhere in China—where the tea comes
from º of course, he did not mean Bohea.
I have said that, IAMBKIN was sweet, but he was even more, he
was beautiful—and he knew it. Many a time and oft, when anoint-
ing, his, well out chin, with soap, preparatory to shaving, or when
deftly tracing a parting through his ambrosial locks, he would
murmur as he gazed in the mirror, “Demme Tought to marry a
Duchess or a millionnairess.” But the hand of fortune was against
him, and he didn't.
His literary knowledge was not extensive, and even when he
bought, the Illustrated London News or the Graphic, he rarely
scanned, the letterpress; but in matters of spelling he certainly
belonged to the phonetic school. I am in a position to positively
assert that he was not the individual who called for the Author on
a revival of Hamlet, but there was no manner of doubt but that he
was a steady patron of the Drama. Indeed, his white gloves with
black thumbs might have been seen placidly folded over his em-
broidered waistcoat, nearly any night in the Stalls of the Frivolity
Theatre, and he actuall ł. the abbreviated Christian names of
some of the Ladies of the Chorus. Yet this familiarity never bred
any contempt for them. On the contrary, it seemed to heighten his
esteem. beit this theatrical culture did not increase, but rather
diminished his financial prosperity. Nor did any calling seem open
to one of his peculiar disposition.
Though his father, a worthy clergyman of the Established Church,
talked to him after the fashion of an Uncle from Holland, and wrote
him epistles as drastic as his sermons, yet LANCELorscouted the idea
of the Civil Service, and declared that commercial pursuits were
those from which no gentleman could derive either pleasure or profit.
It is true that the uniform of Her Majesty's Cavalry had once pos-
sessed attractions for him; but having loftily declined to satisfy the
Army Examiners with regard to the rudiments of Arithmetic and
the French language, he was adjudged to be deficient in martial
capacity, and was therefore debarred the privilege ****
mother country in a º: way. But when he joined the Yeo-
manry, he was more or less consoled, having no vast amount of duty,
and a military garb which was twice as fine as that of a Prussian
Uhlan, thrice as resplendent as the apparel of a Chasseur d'Afrique,
and ninety-nine times superior to the attire of a Don Cossack.
But even a real silver pouch-belt, is not an equivalent for the
current, coin of the realm. This fact was, after two or
years, discovered by LANCELOT's bootmaker, cigar purveyor, and

angry.

Mr. Tough, the Bootmaker, in very coarse taste.
“I can't stand any more weeds,”, grunted. Mr. PUFF, the
Tobacconist, on receiving an unlimited order for eighteenpenny
Regalias.
“I must have a bit on account,” growled Mr. STUFF, the Jeweller.
* And then, finding LAMBKIN deaf to their appeals, they began to .
ply him with persuasive documents, commencing with “WICTORIA,”
and ending with the signature of the Lord Chancellor. To such
annoyances even the most blameless young man is open, in a so-called
free country.
“It’s a beastly shame!” remarked little ToMMY Potts, referring
to the legal instruments, while engaging LANCELOT at billiards, for
£200 a. side, and half-a-crown “ready,” at the Clubhouse of the
Gommies.
“What’s a fellow to do?” responded his antagonist, as he broke
down at his twenty-third consecutive spot-stroke, “I’ve got plenty
of coats, and rings, and neckties, but hang me if I can make much
use of them.”
“Why the dooce don't you go on the stage?” asked ToMMY,
deftly making an all-round-the-table cannon. “If I’d got a mug
like yours, I'd do it to-morrow. There's JACK JUMPs pouching his
tennºr a-week, and I'm blowed if he's in the same street with
you.
“Yes! I fancy I am decent looking,” said LANCELOT, stroking
the down on his superior lip. “That’s not a bad idea of yours,
ToMMY,” he continued, “for though I never can learn a part, I’m
not much out of it in amateur theatricals.”
“Amateurs, are just what. Managers, want,” cried, the other,
enthusiastically. “They don't care about fellahs who start as call-
boys and end as tragedians, Dress is what they want. Not tall hats
and shooting-coats—Game! Toss you for a split.”
That night, LAMBKIN made a mighty resolve, for the arrival of two
fresh summonses from Royalty made him desperate.
Some three months later, Mr. Dooks, of the Ambiguous-Comic,
announced a new comedy º from the Servian) entitled A
British Bull-dog. The part of Sir Rollin Stone was played by
Mr. LANCELOT DAGNEAU. I append a couple of Press criticisms:—
“The débonnaire baronet, Sir Rollin Stone, was allotted to Mr.
LANCELoT DAGNEAU, who is a decided acquisition to the London
stage. His aplomb and general “unstageyness,” if we may be per-
mitted to coin a word, no less than his perfectly fitting suit, induce
us to predict for him no small success in the Art of which he has
undertaken to become a disciple. His ºl. of the often repeated
word “Nevah,” irresistibly reminded us of the chic of Belgravian
salons, and the style of Mayfair Mansions. Mr. DAGNEAU, like the
late lamented Lord BYRoN, has awoke to find himself famous.”—
Daily Dasher.
“First and foremost we must place the Sir Rollin Stone of Mr. L.
DAGNEAU. We can without hesitation assert that so capable a jeune
premier has not been seen for years. , His assumption of foppish
extravagance, his almost reckless regard of stage traditions, and his
refined rendering of the part seemed, as it were, so many exquisite
cameos of higher Iondon life. Equally at home in his puce velvet
lounge coat, his exquisitely fitting frock, or his silk-faced swallow-
tail, Mr. DAGNEAU gained the º: of the crowded audience
from his first appearance to his last exit. Mr. DAGNEAU should
indulge us with his reading of Romco.”—Weekly Warbler.
Messrs. Tough, PUFF, and STUFF are now satisfied, LANCELot's
portrait is one of the staple articles of photographic industry; and
may be found sandwiched in the shop-windows between the like-
nesses of Archbishops and Actresses. He is earning some £5000 a
year. He has never inquired into the personality of GoLDSMITH,
SHERIDAN, BULwFRLYTton, or SHAKSPEARE (why should he f), but
he has played Young Marlow, Charles Surface, Claude Melnotte,
and (as recommended above). Romeo with signal success. He has
not yet married a lady of title or wealth, but a billionnaire is
building a theatre for him. He is a large subscriber to the newly
established Hospital for Destitute Actors.

INEXPERIENCES OF A BARRISTER’S LIFE.
(Not by Serjeant B-ll-nt-me.)
LONG tables, benches, stained-glass windows, and a good deal of
oak. That is my first impression of the Hall of Lincoln's Inn. Then
I become conscious of a number of gentlemen who
are apparently considerably younger than myself,
except a few who are unquestionably considerably
older. These last are white-headed veterans,
wearing spectacles. They seem to be very harm-
less. They have expressions of great sweetness,
and appear to be as innocent as children. Why

clerk asks for my name, and gives me a number. This makes me
feel rather like a convict until he explains that the number corre-
sponds with the number of my seat.
I am two yards from my neighbours to the right and left. In
front of me are pens, ink, and some MS. books. Instructions are
given me, in a circular. “After finishing one book, commence
another l’” The Examiners have sadly over-estimated the extent
of my knowledge |
I collect my thoughts, and try to recall everything I have
crammed for the last twelve months. Then I become conscious of a
discovery which is interesting from a Pºlº! point of view,
but for the moment decidedly embarrassing. . This interesting dis-
covery is that, in spite of my year's hard labour, I can remember
absolutely nothing. However, at this moment a pleasant-lookin
gentleman, carrying the Examination Paper, approaches me, an
presents me with a copy.
The first words rather encourage me. It is a direction. The
candidates are requested to “answer their questions concisely.”
“Come!” I think to myself, “this is capital. Answer them con-
ºisely, of course I will. What can be more concise than Yes’ and
‘No’? I will put ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ all the way down,” Full of this
intention, I read the first question:-

of a piece of freehold land cannot be explained without going back to
the reign of HENRY the Eighth, or an ordinary settlement of land
without having recourse to the laws of Edward the First /?”

A rule : in Shelley's Case!
I explain the laws of their days? This is an age of progress, and the
Examiners are sadly behind their time. -
I am quite mistaken. The Examiners are not behind their time.
On the contrary; they are in the hall, and one of them (so I am tºld
by an attendant) is actually waiting for me. My indignation fades
away, and I become distinctly clammy—ears red, feet cold!
An amiable old gentleman, in a gown is sitting at a table. I
approach him abjectly, and bow! He returns the salutation
courteously, and motions me to take a chair. I obey him. We
have a dark mahogany table before us. Were it not, that he has a
list in front of him, and a pen, I should feel that we had just dined
together tete-d-tête, and were waiting for the appearance of a bottle
of Pºt and some walnuts. He asks me a preliminary question :-
HaveF. been in a Conveyancer's Office P’’ -
“No,” I reply, but in such a tone that it implies, that if he considers
I ought to have been in a conveyancer's office, I will, supply the
accidental omission at once, by entering one on leaving the É. and
remaining there for months, years, or lifel
He seems a little disappointed at my answer.
“Do you intend to practise in India?”
Well, as a matter of fact, I did not. But I have been so unlucky
in my first answer, that I feel inclined to throw my previous career
to the winds, and begin again in India. A moment's reflection,
however, proves to me that it would be extremely inconvenient to
leave my native country at the moment; so I answer in thenegative.
However, there is a depth of meaning in my “No.” I imply in my
tone that there is a sorrowful secret connected with my regretfully
adopted intention of not fº. to India—that were I not, so to speak,
“the child of Destiny,” I should be in Calcutta in a wig and gown
in something less than no time.
My Examiner seems thoroughly disheartened. He had forgiven me
for not being in a conveyancer's office, but he did think 1 was going
to practise in India. However, he is just before all things, and
although disappointed, will yet put a few questions upon law. .
“Now,” says he, as if he were asking me the simplest thing in the
world—just to show me that, in spite of my shortcomings about
India and the conveyancing, he bore me no ill-will—“Now, will you
please tell me the rule in Shelley's Case ?” -
I hesitate. I know that Sir PERCY SHELLEY has opened an
Amateur Theatre in Chelsea, and it occurs to me that, perhaps, there
has been some difficulty under the Licensing Acts. "I am on the
point of 'asking the Examiner if he º: to mean Sir PERCY
SHELLEY's case, when, fortunately for me, he exclaims, impatiently,
“Surely you know the rule in Shelley's Case.”
I wish I were as sure of the matter as he seems to be 1 SHELLEY P
Who on Earth was SHELLEY P I smile in a deprecatory manner.
What had SHELLEY to do with a Rule SHELLEY was a poet; and
RULE kept an oyster-shop in Maiden Lane. Cer Rupº's
oysters were shelly. For a moment I am on the point of telling him
my little joke, when a glance at my Examiner's grave, jºi
convinces me that this is not the time for playfulness, ºr -
“Come,” says the Examiner, “you surely know that when a man
takes an estate in freehold, and in the same instrument.”—
Eureka! I have got it! My mind is no longer a blank, and all
my knowledge flows back into my head as water freshly turned on
rushes into an empty cistern, I should rather think I did know the

played on a musical-box that has been over-wound. . . -
... My Examiner smiles, and asks me another question;. I answer it
sharply. He tries me with another. Same result. He puts down
marks rapidly on his piece of paper, as if he were scoring for me at
some intellectual game of chance, -
“That will do, thank you,” he says at last. -
I should like to ask him if my score has been successful, and which
of us leaves off the winner. But on second thoughts, lest any obi
servation I may now make might be “used against me at my trial”
so to speak), I simply bow with much, native grace and retire.
hould like to ask him to dine with me and square him.

Three weeks afterwards I learn that I have passed a “satisfactory

He continues—

“DINoFAH IN DIFFIcul-TIES.”
(Wide case of Stevens v. Patti last week, with a Butt for the Defendant.)
“ROBERT’” IN EPPING FOREST.
SATTERDAY the 6th of May was a grand day for all of us !
In the first and º: place never did Sun shine upon a lovelier lunshun, and never did
my patrons and there friends do grater justice to it. And this I will say, for above all I
loves tº be troothfool, that tho' the old stagers the Copperashun was a good fust, the members
of Parlyment and the house of Lords was a jolly good 2nd. I must not of course betray
segrets or I might add that sum of the honnerblest names in England cum into our butiful
refreshment tent sum 3 sum 4 times.
It was a grand day for the Copperashun. It was a grand day for the Lord Mare. -
In the fust place, as of course he couldn't condescend to lunch with the mere canoil, as
the French, calls us, he had a lovely dayjournée at the late Queen Elizabeth's lodging
house at Chingford, which, BRown tells me, is Chinese for horseback.
His Ludship druv in his beautiful state carridge to meat his Queen at the Railwa
Station, and then, like a galliant Night of old, he mounted on his nobel steed and rode behin
Her MAJESTY's Carridge, all the way to Eye Beach, a matter of 3 miles, without falling of
once. I saw him arrive, but what was my estonishment to find him in the ordinary costoom
of the period, just like a mere common gentleman. But my surprise soon guy way to
admiration.
I, have seen sumtimes at Crismas time wonderful changes of Princes into Arlequins,
Lord Chamberlains into Panterloons, and Nobblemen into Clowns, but nothing I ever seed
afore equalled what I now saw behind the Tent. His Ludship's Wally were there with
his Ludship's gorgeous array, and in less
time than it takes me to rite it, 'cos I
writes preshus slow, His Ludship, who
had entered the sacred enclosure a mere
English Gentleman, emerged from it in
all the glory of a RICHARD the 3rd at the
Theater Royal, Drewry Lane! Ah, that
was a sight that Ishan’t soon forget. Then
came the Adress, after they’d found the
Recorder who was lost in the scrowge, and
then the QUEEN red her anser, and then
certain Gents was made appy for life by
being introduced to Her, and then she druv
away, and again the sillybrated transforma-
tion scene took place, and the Lord Mare
rode away as he came, only an appier and
a prowder man.
Far above all it was a F. day for the
People, I means the poor People.
But I do 3. as Epping will be kepº:
and respekabel. Anyhow its a grand thing
for the Copperashun to ave done, and 'eres
their jolly good'ealth ! Robert.
THE SEVEN AGES OF WOMAN.

ALL, the world’s a Wardrobe,
And all the girls and women merely wearers:
They have their fashions and their fantasies,
And one she in her time wears many gar-

Throughout her Seven Stages. First, the

Befº and broidered, in her nurse's arms.
And, then the trim-hosed schoolgirl, with
her flounces -
And small-boy-scorningface, tripping, skirt-
waggling,
Coquettishly to school. And then the flirt,
Ogling like Circe, with a business aeillade
Kept on her low-cut corset. Then a bride
Full of strange finery, vestured like an
angel,
Weiled Nº. yet vigilant of glance,
Seeking the Woman's heaven, Admiration,
Even at the Altar's steps. And then the
matron,
In fair rich velvet with suave satin lined,
With eyes severe, and skirts of youthful cut
Full of dress-saws and modish instances,
To teach her girls their part. The sixth age

nto the grey yet gorgeous grandmamm
With gol ... on nose and fan at side,
Her youthful tastes still strong, and worldly
Wise
In sumptuary law, her quavering voice
Prosing of Fashion and Le Follet, pipes
Of robes and bargains rare. Last scene of

In the Chamber of Deputies last week opposite parties
fought over the Civil Interment Bill, the Materialists
claiming for themselves as a Body to be placed on the
same footing with Christian believers. An odd conten-
tion: yet ShakspeaRE, who knew the worthlessness of
a mere body as well as anyone, when he put those lines
about “Great CAESAR dead” into Hamlet's mouth, set a
different store by his own bones when he invoked a curse
on anyone who should remove them. Well, as the
French Minister of Worship observed, “When a man
dies he º something behind to which funeral
honour could be paid”—at all events, he generally leaves
something to be paid, and frequently something to be
honoured, if it’s only his “acceptance.”
By AN ANTI-WAGNER-RING-MAN.—“Call his work
: The Music of the Future?! To mythinking it would
be more correctly described as “The Music of the Im-
perfect.’”
“My Niece's bridal bouquet,” said Mrs. RAMSBOTHAM,
“was lovely. It was entirely composed of white corne-
lians and gardeners.”
TAKING OUR “ PHIL” AT ST. JAMES'S HALL.
BRAvo! and so say all his Sisters and his Cusins and his Aunts'
Certainly Mr. CUSINs did give us a benefit of it last Thursday night.
Fill Harmonic l—it was Crammed Harmonic, and not a seat to spare.
The only fault, perhaps, of the programme was, that there was
hardly quite enough of it; the justice of this complaint the musical
ublic outside the hall can appreciate when we say that Master
EETHOVEN's Pastoral Symphony was one of the lightest and shortest
trifles in the bill of fare, which was breakfast, lunch, five o'clock tea
with muffins, dinner, and two suppers all in one.
The entertainment led off with WEBER's Preciosa ; Miss SANTLEY
appeared as the heroine of the tale, and Mr. SAM BRANDRAM as the Tale
itself; that is, his business was to come in as a Speaking, but not a
Singing Chorus. This arrangement reminded us somewhat of the old
style of comic song, when after each verse came a sort of stage-
direction “spoken,” and the ºf: used to interpolate some-
thing of this sort—"Well, then she takes his arm and §. Out
walking all round the Regency Park up to the Zoological Gardens,
and when she saw one of the horrid animals on the top of a long
pole, she gave a little scream, and he puts his arm round her waist
and says-(Chorus by everyone)—
“O JEMIMA, 0 JEMIMA,
Don't I love you ! Oh!”
This is what Mr. BRANDRAM had to do. He did it well; but
we deeply ºl. with him, as, whenever he was becoming
excited and really arriving at anything like %;"; dramatic
situation, he was at once put down # Mr. CUSINs' baton, which
waved him away, clearly implying, “Here, that’ll do, we’ve had
enough of you—it’s somebody else's turn now,” and up rose all the
sporting Ladies wearing the blue, or red, riband jockey-fashion, and
up rose all the Gentlemen of the Chorus, and down sat Mr. BRAN-
DRAM, abashed, and . disheartened; though in a most
Christian spirit he soon forgot and forgave, coming up again smiling
when kindly called upon so to do by Mr. Cusins.

gave us the names of the dramatis personae. This, apparently, was
a sudden effort of his own inspired imagination, as not a single
name mentioned by him as being necessary to the plot could we
find in the list of characters in the book. Among generalities he
announced, in an off-hand way, what sounded to us at a distance
like “Chorus of Spanish Noodles; ” but this certainly wasn't in the
book, and for the life of us we can't even now make out what he
intended to convey.
When Mr. BRANDRAM gave us an indication of Preciosa, he tem-
§. posed in the perky attitude of a sprightly burlesque chorus-
allet-girl, but as Miss SANTLEY, whom we were to recognise officially
as Preciosa, did not at all enter into the spirit of this impersonation,
it seemed as if there were a coolness between the Lady and Gentle-
man on this point, and so they had necessarily to be kept apart by
Mr. CUSINs, like the Queen's Proctor, “intervening.”
Mr. BRANDRAM's view of Preciosa is doubtless correct—a sort of
Esmeralda, half gipsy, half ballet-dancer, a kind of First-of-May
“My Lady” with the ladle; and this idea was borne out by his imita-
tion of Preciosa's Mamma, whom he represented as speaking and
hobbling like Old Mother Hubbard in the first scene of a Pantomime.
His “Captain,” who suddenly interrupts. Preciosa's soliloquy in the
castle, was a first-rate bit of Tommy-up-the-Chimney ventriloquism,
the illusion being so º: that at first we really thought the voice
came from the second violin, and wondered how he managed to do
it, and yet look so serenely innocent.
We have no space for further description. The New Pianist,
Signor SQUAMBADoº played for a long time, but he only touched the
iano—not his audience. Mme. NILSSEN was rapturously greeted.
EETHoven's Pastoral was, as always, deligh y refreshing; but
confound those Music Hali singers ſ—the reminiscences of “Right
you are, says Moses,” must occur to anyone who is unfortunately
intimate with the refrain of that popular song, on hearing the
recurring phrase of the Shepherd's pipe in the penultimate part
of the Symphony.
* We really must leave this name as printed. It is long since we have seen
such a capital title. As a matter of fact the gentleman is Signor SGAMBATI.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI. -
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Monday Night, May 8.-House of Commons full of Members and of
sorrow. Not a place anywhere on the Benches for the latest gomers
nor room in any heart for other thought than that of grief an
mourning. Members speak low and tread softly, as if in the actual
resence of death. To-night we were to have met in fierce party strife.
he Opposition was to have been arrayed against the Ministerialists
in deadly conflict, and all sorts of manoeuvering going on to secure
the allegiance of Whigs, land-Leaguers, or other eccentric politicians.
But the battle is off." One touch of nature has made the whole
House kin, and those who came to fight remain to mourn:
A piteous sight Mr. GLADston E at the table struggling to, per-
form the duty cast upon him, and broken down with uncontrºllable
grief. “To be mourned like this,” said a Right, Honourable Gentle-
man, looking round the House, the solemn stillness of which was
broken only by the faltering tones of the PREMIER, “one would
even dare to die.”
Tuesday Night.—“For good bustling...indignation of a chirping
kind, give mé Sir Rich ARD CRoss.” The remark is Sir CHARLES
DILKE's, and there is a good
deal in it. Sir RICHARD, a
very smart man, a little of the
Quarter-Sessions order. What
with being in the Commission
of the Peace many years, and
at the Home Office several more,
has assumed, for daily use, a
magisterial air which always
prompts him to regard some
particular Member as in the
dock. Sometimes it is the
House of Commons collectively,
or the Ministerial majorit
which has been convicted, an
straightway Sir RICHARD, in
his capacity of presiding Ma-
gistrate, passes sentence, and
improves the occasion by a few
remarks. To-night it is Mr.
CHAMBERLAIN at whom he
chirrups.
“Like a prosperous sparrow
reproving a worm for not being
out early enough in the morn-
ing to §e caught,” says Sir
WILLIAM HARCOURT, regarding with an amused smile his successor
as he stands at the table with his head on one side, his hand sharply
marking the * of his speech. Looks comically like a sparrow
standing on one leg.
. CHAMBERLAIN certainly deserves all he gets. Gone so far as to
insinuate that the Conservative Opposition, finding Ballot Bill second
or third on the Orders, talked exhaustively on preceding subjects
till too late to proceed with debate! Sir RICHARD CRoss properly
shocked at this, so is Mr. WARToN, so is Mr. GoRST, so is Earl PERCY,
and so say all of them. Encouraged by their cheers, Sir RICHARD
CRoss chirrups so loudly, that Alderman LAWRENCE, who has been
sleeping on the Cross Benches, thinks it is early morning, and rushes
out of the House to catch the City Train. Bill, nevertheless, read
a Second Time, and a great deal more business done. An aggregate
sufficient to take away the breath of the SPEAKER. Clerk at the
table cannot keep up with the record. Really nothin
remarkable about it; only momentarily back in the .#
times when Members came down to do business, not to
obstruct it.
Felt the line must be drawn somewhere. Ruled
sharp at the application of Mr. O'SULLIVAN to read
his Whiskey Bill a Second, Time. With tears in his
voice, Mr. O'Sullivan pleads for the Bill. Never was
such a Bill; everybody loves it, distillers and teetotallers, . . . .
Mr. RAMSAY and Sir WILFRID Lawson. All he wants is ºpiºiº
whiskey in bond a year before it goes into consumption. * *
“Why, certºnly,” says Sir WILFRID; “keep it in bond a year—
twenty years; the longer the better.”
ouse wºuld not listen to it. Suddenly virtuous. , Done enough
for one night, and whiskey must continue to be recklessly removed
from bond.
Business done,—Enormous. More accomplished between half-past
four and eight to-night than during the rest of the Session.
l}r-ºl-gh ; nothing if not noisy.
... Wednesday Afternoon.-Mr. PEASE brings in Bill discriminating
in the matter of Capital Punishment; Lord Colin CAMPBELL a
Measure dealing with Scotch Licensing Laws. Mr. NEW DEGATE
devoutly “ i. there was nothing bloodthirsty in his nature,” but
could not take these º of PEASE at any
price. Nevertheless, Bill read a Second Time.
Liquor debate a little dry. Mr. WARTON joined
in it. So much interested in the question, didn't
observe that quarter-to-six was at hand, and Bill
consequently talked out, as they say.
Thursday Night. — “WAT 1 TYLER P2’ Sir
Yº. *. ...; as º º:
arwich rose frombehind front Opposition Bench. - ish-
Sir HENRY TYLER thinks it's no use parleying cºh
about matters. “Let’s go to the root of it at once,” -
he had said to Mr. WARtoN, during the Cabinet Council held just be-
fore the House met; present: Mr. WARTON, Mr. CHARLEs LEwis, Mr.
STANLEY LEIGHToN, Sir H. TYLER, and Lord FolkESTONE. Agreed that
matters would be improved if the Government turned out. Accord-
ingly, HENRY the TYLER draws up Amendment, declaring Govern-
ment not fit to administer affairs in Ireland. Rather disappointing
result. Expected whole Conservative Party to cheer. Unfortunately
went out in a fizzle. Opposition laughed, Mr. CHRISTOPHER SYKES,
looking languidly across the House, audibly observed, “Thought the
#!...º. to read— prºpetºus —new company. Sir NRY
TYLER, M.P., Chairman.” Sir STAFFoRD Northcote frowned, and
GIBSON openly scolded. Sir HENRY then said he'd better postpone
his Motion.
DRUMMOND crying “Wolff l Wolf Fl’’ again. Something wrong
in Egypt. DRUMMOND equal to either end of the Mediterranean,
though “disappointed,” with both as far as they are affected by
the Foreign Policy of Government.
HARcourt up at last with latest Peace Preservation, Bill. House

No laughing matter when presently, having exhausted the flowers
of his rhetoric, WERNoN came to the provisions of the Bill, Land-
Leaguers lapse into gloomy silence, with the exception of Joseph
GILLIs and Mr. HEALY. J. G. somehow or other lost his place amid
the crush. Got out of sight at the end of the Bench, but his voice
distinctly audible. , Joseph is in a sardonical scornful mood. Mr.
HEALY also inclined to be ironical. “Ho! of course !” he cried.
“Would you, ah? Ho! ho!” and so on, through º a catalogue
of withering ejaculations. “Mr. HEALY,” said Lord EDWARD FITz-
MAURICE, “is the Miss Miggs of the House of Commons. , Only
he's always in the mood presented by the young Lady when denied
re-admittance to the Warden household.”
“Indeed now. Ah! ah! Ho! yes!” says Mr. HEALY in reply.
Business done.—Bill for the Prevention of Crime in

GEE UP, NEDDY
As the Corporation of the City of London in their
parental affection for that rickety ill-mannered bantling
of theirs, Billingsgate Market, are praying the House of
Lords to prevent any other Market from competing with
it, principally because it was so enacted by Edward THE
THIRD of blessed memory, they might like to know some
of the wise and liberal provisions of a statute that was
enacted by the same most gracious Sovereign for regula-
ting not Markets but Labour; and as it cannot be a bit
more absurd to attempt to regulate Labour by the re-
uirements and ideas prevalent five hundred years ago,
than it is to limit the number of Markets at the present
time to what was considered sufficient five hundred years
ago for one-tenth of the present population, Mr. Punch
submits them to that small majority of the Members of
the Corporation who, having determined to oppose a New
Fish Market because opposed to their chartered rights,
are bound in consistency to support their adoption.
“Every able-bodied Pelson under sixty, not having to live
on, shall be bound to serve him that doth require him, or be
committed to Gaol.
“If a Workman or Servant depart from service before the
time agreed upon, he shall be imprisoned.
“The old wages, and no more, shall be given to Servants.
“If any Artificer or Workman take more wages than were
wont to be paid, he shall be committed to Gaol.
“Wictuals shall be sold at reasonable prices.
“He that taketh more wages than is accustomably given,
shall pay the surplus to the Town where he dwelleth, towards
the King's taxes.”
According to these sage regulations of the illustrious
Neddy whose pious memory the Corporation delight to
honour, everyone of their Officers who has had his salary
increased since his first appointment, would at the present
time be an inmate of Her Majesty's Gaol at Holloway, and
would owe enormous sums to Her Majesty's Exchequer.
As these are not “consummations devoutly to be
wished” either by the excellent Officers aforesaid or by
their employers, the Corporation, they may all be reason-
ably expected to entertain grave doubts as to the desira-
bility of allowing themselves to be guided in even more
important matters by the wisdom, or want of it, of
NEDDY THE THIRD.

AN UNSPEAKABLE LETTER.
(Published quite by mistake.)
Istamboul, 21st Jomada II., 1299.
RESPECTED WILLIAMs PASHA,
. . . For to address you familiarly thus, in a communication to
which, for your sake, I do not wish as yet to impart the character of
a. º European diplomatic manifesto, is, believe me, most agree-
able to me. Respected WILLIAMs, I have taken up my pen because
I am most truly anxious to assist you. I hear you are in much per-
plexity and trouble; I am told that that portion of the mighty Empire
you administer, called Ireland, is practically given over to anarchy,
and that a weak and ...; Executive has now for eighteen
months, much to your chagrin and disappointment, found itself utterly
unequai to cope with the forces of the organised disaffection persist-
ently arrayed against it. To hear this, dear WILLIAMs, grieves me,
I assure you, very much; and though I have been sitting up and drink-
ing strong coffee with the Sheik-ul-Islam all night, talking the matter
over with a view to seeing what I can do for you, I confess I can dis-
cover no escape for you from your difficulty but such as is offered by
an immediate armed foreign intervention under the guarantee of a
European protectorate. And this intervention I ºf: willing to
undertake in the interest of international security.
do not go so far as to insist that this occupation, which I propose
to effect by landing 60,000 of my regular troops at Dublin forthwith,
need necessarily be permanent; but I should certainly not consent
to authorise its termination until a standard of social right, a respect
for constituted authority, and a general security of life and property,
such as an enlightened Mahometan civilisation understands these
things, had been adequately, fully and securely established in every
portion of the disorganised province.
You must not deem me, my Respected WILLIAMs, severe, when in
the face of the continued and chronic disorder for which I am
obliged to hold your Constitutional Government responsible, I insist
that there is nothing for it but the turning of you, and those who
like you are imbued with Western ideas—clean out, all of you—“Bag
and Baggage.” Not that I know whether that is the correct phrase,
or indeed am quite sure what it means. But it was once shown to
me in the pages of one of your Half-crown Reviews, and I have no
doubt it is excellent English, and that you, master as you are of
forcible nervous language, will for one thoroughly understand it.
I mistake not, too, there is, moreover, a special reason why I,
of all your European friends, should do you this friendly service.
The warm and kindly interest you were once so good as to manifest
in the welfare of a certain portion of my own Empire, the disturb-
ance of which at the time occasioned me some trifling embarrassment,
has not been forgotten by me. There, is an Arabian proverb that
says, “The bastinado that is not unpleasant to one foot, will pro-
bably be equally enjoyed by the other.” I do not know, my respected
WILLIAMs, whether you follow me, but I mean this letter tº be a
friendly private offer, made by one anxious to save you from the
humiliation of a public scandal. You once gave me your assistance.
Here is mine. W. cannot have the “Sick Man” always, troubling
us. We should have to call, in a doctor, and how would you, like
BISMARCK, for instance, to give his prescription, and demand his
fee ? You see I am so friendly that I am quite jocular. But unless
you can put things straight, I must positively intervene. Kismet."
Yours, my dear WILLIAMs PASHA, with much kindly interest and
esteem, ABDUL HAMID.
P.S.—I have just read your latest Manifesto. “No Jury,” and
some other excellent precautions. Very good, my dear WILLIAMs;
hope it may answer. Perhaps I shan’t now have to come over after
all, which would be a great advantage to your solyent British tax-
payer; as interventions are costly things, and I don't do business for
nothing ! “In the name of the Profit,” as the Sheik would say after
dinner. My vassal in Egypt is giving his, Suzerain some trouble.
Your v. s—ships, I mean—will soon be there, eh?

THE IRISH FRANKENSTEIN.
WHEN I found?so astonishing a power placed within my hands
I hesitated some time concerning the manner in which should
employ it. But the visions of fancy and the pride of power urged
me onward, and forbade too nice scruples or too prolonged delay.
Scruple indeed seemed unworthy weakness in the light of so imposing
an enterprise. The flame of an unholy ambition, whilst firing the
courage, sears the conscience. What count some cunning sophistry
of word, some politic ruthlessness of action, in the great tasks of
conquest or of creation? Life and death appeared to me ideal
bounds which I might set at nought and break down in my pursuit
of—what ?
- - + +
How can I delineate the Monster which with such infinite pains
and care I had endeavoured to form * I had gazed on it when it
was unfinished—it was hideous then, though to my distraught fancy
bearing the Fº and the potency of benignant beauty. - - -
I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but
now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and
breathless horror and disgust filled my heart. Mingled with this
horror I felt the bitterness of disappointment; dreams vain, violent,
conscienceless visions, that had been my food and pleasant rest for
so long a space, were now become hell to me; and the change was so
rapid, the overthrow so completel
- - - - - -
A flash as of blood-red lightning illuminated the object, and dis-
covered, its shape plainly to me; its gigantic stature and its
deformity of aspect, more, hideous than belongs to humanity,
informed me that it was the ruthless wretch, the conscienceless
demon, the baneful and blood-stained Monster to which I had given
life. I had turned loose into the world a depraved Horror, whose
delight was in carnage and chaos: had it not murdered my country-
men, had it not wrecked the rising * of my country, had it not
branded the author of its being, and the place of its birth, with the
blood-red, indelible brand of shame?
- - - - - -
It approached; its countenance bespoke bold defiance, combined
with disdain and malignity, while its unearthly ugliness rendered it
almost too horrible for human eye. And yet—yet was it not my
Master to the very extent that it was my Creature g Hideous fatality;
inevitable NEMEsis of the shapers of ill! Had I not framed it,
breathed into it my own spirit, pandered to its excesses when they
seemed to serve my ends, profited by the very villanies which I had
assumed to deprecate and denounce? And now that the work of my
brain had got beyond the power of my hand, now that my heart
sickened, more even with dread than with honest disgust, what
power of control, of exorcism, of self-emancipation was left with me?
Shaken to the soul, I addressed it, yet faintly and falteringly, in
words . expressive of disavowal and detestation. It met my
late reproach, my tardy denunciation, with mockery and defiance.
Hideous, blood-stained, bestial, ruthless inits rage, implacable in its
revengefulness, cynical inits contemptuous challenge of my authority
it seemed another and a fouler Caliban in revolt, an successful
revolt, against the framer and fosterer of its maleficent existence.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE PRIZE RING DES NIBELUNGEN ;
oR, PANTo-MIME AND THE THREE MERRY MAIDENs of THE RHINo.
FEw men have made more noise in the world than Herr RICHARD
WAGNER, and if anybody doubt it, let him try the Ring des Nibel-
tungen; or, Panto-Mime and the Three Merry Maidens of the Rhino.
The Nibelungen is made up of “motives,” but Herr, WAGNER's
motives are often hard to understand. “Blow it all !” says Herr
WAGNER (they have trombones, and they all do it), “here goes!”
Herr WAGNER's rule is, “When in doubt, play the drum.” . This
raises a spirit of
º emulation in the
º // bosom of the
º – Fº Z gentleman who
Nº. has been en-
trusted with the
cymbals. Bang
they go! The
violins tremble
with indigna-
Nº tion. Herr SEIDL

cleides; at it go

to show that they are not to be put down by the odds against them.
Half-a-dozen “motives” have been going on—if one could only
have picked them out.
The Nibelungen opens with a view of some queer fish in an
Aquarium. Here are the Rhine Maidens with Our New Patent Self-
instructing Swimming *: fitted on them, trying to remember
that pretty little thing they heard last night. They don't recollect
the proper words, so Woglinde sings the tune, which seems to be
badly recollected from MENDELssohn, to the thrilling words:–
“Weia! Waga" Wagala Weia!
Wallala, weiala weia!”
Then “Gin a body meet a body coming through the Rhine.”
Everybody joins in chorus.
These bodies are taking care of the }..."; or Rhino, as it is gene-
rally called, and a bad young man, Panto-Mime's brother, comes and
walks about in the water; to which these bold young minxes do not
object until he goes up the ladder, which has been incautiously left,
from the bottom of the Rhine to the shelf on which the Rhino rests,
and walks off with the treasure. Then they let off the steam—which,
by the way, they do on every possible occasion. Before the steam
has quite evaporated, and while there is still a good deal of Hot-
bathy smell about the place, the gauze rises, and discovers about as
coarsely a painted scene as we ever remember. Here Wotan, the
King of the Gods, is in a very low state of mind, because the
Giants have built him a palace and are coming to ask for their
money. The “Can't-pay-the-Rent-and-don't-know-what-I-shall-
do-about-the-Tares Motive” expresses Wotan’s sorrow, after which
to some *:::: old pantomime music, in come the giants Fafner and
Fasolt. You know they are giants directly, because it is stated so
in the bill; though, as a matter of fact, dwarfs, giants, and gods
are all the same size. To their “Now-then,-Guv'nor, −are-you-
going-to-weigh-in Ż
Motive,” Wotan re-
plies that he really
shall be very much

they go, taking with them the
goddess Fry-a, so named because
she acts as a sort of plain cook and bakes the apples, which is
all that keeps the gods young. For these gods are in a very bad way

altogether. Wotan, who is a disreputable old man, then goes off
on an expedition to steal the Rhino from Panto-Mime's brother,
who is very good at conjuring tricks; and, at the bad old man's
request, º, himself into a crocodile, which makes the god
very nervous, and he hits at him with his spear to the “I-say, -you-
know,-no-larks Motive.” The performer then changes himself into
a toad, and to the “ Halloa /-now-I’ve-got-you Motive,” Wotan
treads on him and steals the ring and the money. The Giants call
again, Wotan settles their little account, and then, to the “Schlog-
him-on-the-kop Motive,” #. settles his brother.
Parts of the Walküre had better not be talked about; but it may be
said that Siegmund, having been engaged in mortal combat for some

hours with the brother of Hunting (a great sportsman), runs away,
and takes refuge in Hunting's hut. Hunting asks him to supper,
ºbut doesn't give him any, and Siegmund, who hates being j.
accepts a challenge to settle it next morning after breakfast—that is
to say, after Hunting's breakfast, for Siegmund's chances of getting
any are remote. Wotan's wife drives in on her chariot, drawn by
rams to the “Baa, haa, -black-sheep Motive,” and after letting the
poor old god have it right and left, insists upon his seconding Hunt-
ºng; and his daughter Brünnhilde backs up Siegmund, though her
father distinctly tells her not to do so. Neither of the combatants
has the least idea of fighting, and they both die apparently of fright,
in spite of the fact that Siegmund has found a sword sticking in a tree
which he has been assured will render him invincible; but that's
the . it happens when Herr WAG-NER is to the fore. The Prize
Ring they are all fighting about is not really the least good to any-
body, and the all-conquering sword is smashed at the first go off.
Wotan then proceeds to have it out with Brünnhilde, who has run
away to her sisters, and finds them playing at horses, mounted on
little wooden animals, to the “Sir-to-four-on-the-field,-two-to-one-
bar-one Motive.” Up comes Wotan and condemns Brünnhilde to go
to sleep for an indefinite period, only permitting her to have a fire
lighted to prevent the bad effects of the night air, lest, when she does
wake up, influenza should prevent her from expressing her gratitude
to the gallant knight who rescues her. The fire is shown by much
vapour with light thrown on it, but it is not very effective here, and
can scarcely be called a succès de steam.
This Knight is to be Siegfried, who is living in the forest with
Panto-Mime, and, indulging in a good deal of bear-play—brings a
bear in with him to help; but though the bear is evidently connected
with Panto-Mime, that dwarf does not like it. Wotan is prowling
about, and as he can't ſº anyone else to listen to him, * Panto-
Mime is rather small, he keeps on obliging him with another staye,
till Siegfried ... together the fragments of the sword his
father, Siegmund, made such a mess of, and goes for the giant Faf-

A BALLADE OF THE ROW.
THERE is nothing so much to my fancy
As to sit where young lovers frequent,
In the Park, by the side of Miss PANsy,
Who hasn't a heart—and less rent!-
'Neath the branches that shade like a tent,
And watch “the subdued and the slow,”
The restless, the hot, the content,
In a penny armchair in the Row.
Poor FRANK you see at a glance he
Is commencing at last to repent
The vows that he pledged in the dance he
Sat out with old Mrs. Consent.
There's ToM, who has come to invent
An excuse for his marriage with F.Lo,
Who sings at the Suffolk and Kent,…
In a penny armchair in the Row.
Old Time makes no further advance, he
Has not even heart to relent;
He holds daily drill, yet perchance he
Has a penchant for ribbons and scent.
The procession of fashion that bent
O'er the rails when Beau BRUMMEL was beau
Are passed—yet we do not lament,
In our penny armchair in the Row.

general appreciation of larks has taught him to understand the lan-
guage of the birds, and one of them, to the “ Second-turning-to-the-
right-and-then-keep-straight-on Motive,” tells him where Brünnhilde
is sleeping. He goes, wakes her up, falls in love with her, and then
begins the Grand Vocal Competition. “Nice voice you have,” says
Siegfried, “Oh, do you think so? That’s very kind of you,” says
Brünnhilde. “Not in the least. Can you sing A's P’ “Certainly.
Can you? I can ºf B’s.” “Really I can sing C sharp, if I
want to. Let's see how long we can keep on at it? I’m a little
out of practice, though. ...Why, I’ve been sleeping here since long
before you were born!” “How strangel Never mind. Come on l’”
Advice to those who want to hear the Grand Wocal Competition:-
Go outside. Use your own judgment as to coming in again.
There is one excellent thing about the Götterdämmerung—it is the
last of the series.
Advice to those who go to hear the Götterdämmerung (which
begins at half-past six):-See the Prologue; go and dine quietly at
your Club; come back and ask a friend to tell you all about Gunter
—without the ices—and his relations. Here are Siegfried and
Brünnhilde. He gives her thering, she gives him her horse. To the
“Trifle-weak-in-the-forelegs, but—otherwise-sound-enough Motive,”
Brünnhilde tells her husband to “uphold him well,” (see Mr. ALFRED
FoEMAN's ingenious translation of the book). Unfortunately, how-
ever, Siegfried, having got a f: deal mixed up with all the con-
juring business, forgets that he is married, commits bigamy, and is
stuck in the back, when he isn't looking, by his brother-in-law,
†: who is probably rehearsing Clown's business for Christmas,
as he waggishly directs Siegfried's attention to a couple of birds
up in the air, and then sticks him. The “ Dirty-mean-trick
Motive” expresses natural abhorrence. Out of forty-five charac-
ters, forty-one are, now dead, so the vocalists give in, and with a
triumphant flourish in the orchestrait’s all over.
Honourable mention: Herr NIRMANN, voice a good deal worn, but
good artist all round. Herr HEINRICH Wogſ, good singer, good
actor. Herr SCHLosses, very admirable performance of Pinto:
Mime. ... If Herr WAGNER's music is in advance of his age (is he
twelve P), his mise en scène is very far behind it.

4. First that your garments will almost certainly get muddied.
Secondly, that your person will most probably be bruised.
. Q. Why the latter?—A. The driver of a Hansom (who never
dismounts if he can help it, save to drink) has, from his position but
little control over the movements of his animal; Hansom cab-horses
are peculiarly given to starts, jerks, and bolts, and a man with one

slightest movement throws against the wheel, or precipitates into

doors of the vehicle yourself, which, on a narrow footboard, and with
a fidgety horse, is an operation of much difficulty and some danger.

it can hardly in strictness be said to have an interior. The two
“fares” which constitute its licensed complement, are crammed
together in narrow compass on an unco ortable seat. If the
weather be dry, the cushion will be dusty; if it rain, the cushion
will be damp, giving a choice between dirt and rheumatism. If the
window be left up, the Jehu's long-tailed whip will flourish and flick
about your face, to the considerable danger of your eyesight; if it be
let down, it will probably damage your nose or your hatin its descent.
When down, it will somehow keep out the fresh air, whilst allowing
the rain to drive into your eyes or trickle on to your lap. When the
horse falls, the doors will fly open, and you be shot forward against
the window (if down), or the footboard. When you alight, the perils
of getting in are repeated in an aggravated form. It will be seen
how all these facts justify the title of “Safety Cab” bestowed upon
the vehicle. -
Q. And how do you communicate with the driver of a Hansom P
A. You can only do so either by using your umbrella as a sort of
semaphore, or by howling through a small trap in the roof, which
you may or may not be able to open, according as the driver's many
wraps, or his newspaper may or may not happen to be over it.
Q. Is it not within the resources of Civilisation to improve the
construction and management of the British Cab 2
A. Possibly. Indeed slight spasmodic efforts in that, direction
have been made from time to time, chiefly by the introduction of
such small and not absolutely essential fittings as looking-glasses
and ash-trays. But substantial and general improvement, seems at
present beyond the effort of invention, the hope of the public, or the
purview of the official mind.

She walke .*.*. very proud of her finery, and thinking
how it would astonish her little cousins. Still she was not happy,
because she knew she was doing wrong. She had to cross a meadow,
where there was a number of cattle and horses grazing. Now,
MARY was not afraid usually, but she began to wish she had reached
the other side, and regretted she had not brought her umbrella.
She heard steps behind her, and she was horrified to see a gigantic
brindled Moocow was following her as fast as it could.
The poor child stood still, till she felt the hot breath of her pursuer
on her cheek, then she took to her heels and ran as fast as her feet
would carry her. The MoQcow quickened its pace. MARy expected
every moment to be, tossed high, in the air. She stumbled over a
hillock, and fell, and then she fainted. When she came to herself
she found she was unhurt, but discovered the Moocow had torn off
her hat, and was at that moment rending her beautiful cherry-
coloured ribbons to shreds in a distant corner of the field. It was
beginning to rain fast. MARY had to walk home in the wet: she
gaught a bad cold; and was sent to bed directly she returned. She
had to wear her Żnin, with its faded blue ribbons, all the summer;
and whenever she is inclined to be naughty, her Mamma has only to
mention the word “Moocow” to insure her instant obedience.
THE SALON IN A NUTSHELL.
(For Diners-Out who don't want to cross the Channel.)
The Bastien Lepage-ists.-Portraits of big-wigs—or gros bonnets
a poil, chiefly the latter, as being more patriotic and generally un-
pleasant to Germany. Style new—or at any rate a reversal of the
old Marshal MACMAHON done, for instance, in tones absurdly old-
fashioned painters would take to depict St. Simeon Stylites; and
the President of the Cour de Cassagnation in an attitude threatening
a cancan to which the Municipal Guard would object.
Gustave Doré-ists.--Allegorical or nothing —though sometimes
both. At any rate, large and chromolithographical. May range
from an Alpine range to an arrangement in Red Sea fire. Latest
tendency is to rather affect the scenery line of beauty, just to show
that you can do anything when you are pushed to it. . But good old
original devoted Doréists still adhere, without much drying varnish
however, to the three-yard canvas "...ºf at least the population
of a German principality variously disguised.
Pretty Actresses' Portraitists.-The names of these artists—and
models, though not always models in every respect—are Legion, and
therefore excluded from our columns. . But you may safely say that

an eau forte as to be almost an eau de vie; and that the portrait

and you will prove as much knowledge of BURKE as of WASARI.
Carolus Duranists.-Can make them something the same thing

exclusively feminine and fashionable. Great thing, attitude.
Rollists.-A new category, came in like their pictures, on Rollers.

WAGNER WAGGERIES.
OF course it is utterly bad taste to declare that we would far rather
hear The Flying Dutchman or Lohengrin than the whole of the Ring
des Nibelungen. After four nights of the Ring, with the Ring of it
still in our ears, – which
makes us look and feel quite
savage, we deliberately say,
“Never again with you,
Wotan, Siegfried, & Co...!”
It appears to our untutored
and uncultivated taste that
the Ring, taken as an “all
might be expected from an
impulsive musician after see-
ing a melodrama and a panto-
: mime for the first time, and
struck by the happy º of
combining the effects and set-
ting them to music. As to
“Motives”—this is no marvel-
lous creation of genius, as in
every pantomime or ballet of
action there has always been a
- certain phrase to indicate the
arrival of every character possessing a marked individuality. When
the Giant enters in Jack the Giant-Killer, there is the Giant Motive;
and whenever Blunderbore is “heard without,” this Motive recurs.
The celebrated “Every Schoolboy” who has been to a Christmas
tomime knows by the music when a fairy is going to appear, and
when Old Mother Hubbard is about to enter with her crutch-handled
stick, also when Pantaloon is coming, by the conventional “hobble

Motive.
round" work, is just what
motive.” Nay, in a pantomime, there is a recurring Motive, we
fancy, for a policeman, and invariably a rum-tum-tum-tum-tiddly-
iddly-iddly-iddly Motive for the entrance of Clown. Of course
genuine pantomime may be considered as the highest form of
Dramatic Art; and this view must be seriously held by all Wagner-
ites, with whom in this instance we are inclined to agree.
In melodrama the music is suited to the action throughout; and
the repetition in Act III. of a strain that first occurs in Act I. is so
invariably recognised as a connecting link for a train of thought that,
on hearing it, the spectator can positively say, “Here she is again!”
or “She’s thinking of the parting with her lover in Act I.”
The Story of the Ring could be easily told in three, or, at the most,
four Acts. As it is, several moderate “cuts' have been found neces-
sary. How the audience brightened up whenever there was anything
resembling a “tune” . How delighted they are when Herr Vogl
acts and does something; and how pleased is everyone to get a laugh
at the Dragon's expense i
Our recipe for, a Festival Play of this sort is:-Give a Composer
plenty of rope and any amount of brass. We could do it ourselves if
we only had brass enough; and we at once acknowledge that our
Leading Motive would be the Pecuniary, or “Chink Motive.”
There is a greater chance for the Drury Lane German Opera,
which commenced last week with Lohengrin and Tannhaüser. Die
| Meistersinger is advertised for the 30th May; WEBER's Euryanthe
for June 6th, and Wagner's Trisian undisºde for the 20th. hat-
ever the Wagner Motives may be for, appealing to the British
|Public, whether der “chinken-motive” above-mentioned, or simply
artistic, or a reasonable combination of both, we wish our musical
Cousins-German success, and a blessing “on both their Houses.”
A FEMALE is at the bottom of every conspiracy. Look for the woman
in the Kilmainham Treaty Mystery, and you find her in O'SHRA

ForsTER had a bad time of it in the House for two Sessions. The
only demonstration his rising created came in form of cries and yells
from Irish quarter. “Like that engaging young person Woºds-
WQRTH unaccountably loved,” says Edward CLARKE (so good a
fellow that he oughtn't to wear that dreadful suit of Tweed)–
“She dwelt among the untrodden ways
Beside the springs of Dove,

on an otherwise prosperous person.
At length, at end of sitting, the redoubtable Captain rises. Does
not make a long speech, there being, in fact, as he observed, with one
hand in his trowsers' pocket and a º glance towards the
unfortunate FonstEB, “Nothing more to be said to a gentleman who

TOM, JERRY, AND YOUNG
OUR heroes had just polished off their breakfast one morning in
May, when the following note arrived from Young Bob Logic:-
MY DEAR old CoCKs,
You are on, of course, for THE DERBY. The road is
played out,” so I propose to go down with some gommies by Rail.
The Station is WATER,00; where, as the Midshipmite said of the
savage island he visited, “Manners none, customs beastly : ” but I
will “drop in” on you, and we will face the crowd together.
6D, The Albany. Yours hugely, Bob LoGIC.
“A very familiar letter,” said the CoRINTHIAN to his Coz, JERRY.
“In our days *: men did not write in that fashion to their
elders; though I have myself written many a flash note like that to
Bob's Papa–the Oxonian. I am very fond of these hippie contests
myself, and you, JERRY, are good at judging a prad. So we will go
and see this time-honoured race, as proposed to us. At any rate, we
shall see LIFE, mix with the Goes and the Shady ones, and find
character, which is the target at which we shoot.”
On the eventful morning Bob appeared in a stylish overcoat, with
a race-glass slung over his shoulders, and ToM and JERRY, having
duly “got into their togs,” the TRIo proceeded to the Waterloo
Station. It was indeed a motley sight, and, as the CoRINTHIAN
remarked to his Coz, “there was life enough in the assemblage to
furnish materials for a SMolleTT and a Hogarth.” By the side of
the platform there was drawn up a series of trains, the carriages
ull of customers of the Railway Company, but none of them seemed
“on the move;” and, as JERRY said, a Railway that neglected the
interests of its patrons in that way, could hardly expect to succeed.
But the scene on the gº. was rich in all forms of life. There
was the nob, the snob, the cad, the dodger, the nigger, the cadger,
the sham Tar, the canny Scot, the orange-woman, the roguish, the
schemer, the hypocrite, the fly cove, the mug, the sharp, the flat, and
the bookmaker, all jostling together near the Booking-Office, while
the Swell was also in the crush, and could hardly “hold his own.”
For what young Bob called THE Rough was there in “great force,”
and, as the CoRINTHIAN said to his Coz, more disreputable “speci-
mens of humanity” he had never seen. “Who
are yer a shovin' on P’’ was the exclamation of
one of these cly-faking coves to young Logic,
as the TRIo, elbowed their way through the
motley assemblage, but our Bob was “up to the
fº. and made his way like a good'un.
e CoRINTHEAN, too, was “all there,” and
JERRY followed on their heels, but not before
a little PRIg, whose head must have been
sorºred on the right way, had nabbed his
et-book, while his ticker also disappeared
in the scramble, so that, as his Coz remarked,
with the philºsºphy of a friend who “ has not
been had,” that sartain persons had been “too
many” for JERRY. The CoRINTHIAN was heard
further to declare that even in the old days
“Sharp's the Word.”

when they visited “The Back Slums,” masquerading among the
cadgers, they had never seen such a seething mass of low life, ras-
cality, wickedness, and deceit, so many shy coves, flash men, and
Black Legs. “It is very curious, my dear JERRY,” said the Co-
RINTHIAN, “that although the Horse is one of the noblest of animals,
he contrives to make all those who have much to do with him the
meanest of men. These HIPPIC Contests are all very well, but
when the PEER and the Parliamentary Orator are as anxious as
the LEG to lay their blunt, we at once see that a great many shady
transactions must take place, which show the seamy side of LIFE IN
LoNDoN.” “You may well say that,” answered young LoGIc.
“There isn't a man in the Crowd who wouldn't “best’ his grand-
mother over a race, if the old lady wasn't fly; and I tell you what,
the girls bet just as much as we do nowadays, and get ſ". ood
‘tips, too.” “Dear me!” said the CoRINTHIAN, “I should have
thought a lady would have been above such a thing, but the highs
and the lows seem so mixed nowadays, that it is impossible to distin-
guish them.” -
Our TRIo obtained a carriage with some difficulty; and, as is often
the case on this line, it deserved to be stigmatised as a foul-smelling
DEN. There were one or two coves in it who were evidently on the
flat-catching lay, and showed our heroes some curious tricks with
three cards, which seemed very much to interest an elderly gentle-
man dressed like a farmer. He sported his blunt, and won, and then
asked the CoRINTHIAN to “put a bit on.” This was done, and as
ToM and JERRY in old days had been “had'...by the broad coves at
cards, they were “fly” to this “little trick,” and won their money
also. This put the players in a great rage, and, as the CoRINTHIAN
said, they had better look elsewhere for pigeons, while young, Logic
asked them if they supposed he and “his ſº were mugs.” At first
the tricksters seemed inclined to “show fight,” especially the farmiº
who was found to be in the swim, but they “thought better of it,”
and soon left the carriage quite crestfallen.
On arriving at the Cºurse, the TRro proceeded to the Grand
Stand, and also to “The Ring,” where they sported their blunt with
one or two of Logic's friends. Beauty smiled down upon them, and
the CoRrNTHIAN was disgusted to find that it had
become a profession, while the shouts and yells
of the “Bookie's "deafened their ears.
came the great race, and as the horses
round Tattenham Corner, and came up
straight” to the winnin º a roar went up
from the mighty multitude like the sound of the
sea upon a rocky shore. "'Twas indeed a
stirring moment,” said the CoRINTHIAN, “in
that minute many a poor fellow ‘lives a life-
time'—for he does not know whether he is to
win or lose. Our “little bit” does not matter
but it is a terrible affair when a man is hard
hit.” So after luncheon and a pleasant out-
ing, Toºr, JERRY, and Logic, went home on the
evening of the “Derby Day.”

THIs being the fifth Anniversary of the establishment of the New
School of Dramatic Art, and it having been rumoured that important
action, affecting the future of this singularly unfortunate Institu-
tion, would probably be taken on the occasion of the forthcomin
Annual Meeting, there was, as had been expected, a very large an
influential attendance. Among the distinguished company present
were the Marquis and Marchioness of BRISTOL, the Marquis and
Marchioness of HEADFoET, the Countess of WHARNCLIFFE, Wiscount
and Wiscountess BARRINGTON, the Hon. MARY BOYLE Lord Rowton,

and others, who, it may be remembered, had all kindly given their
valuable sanction to the undertaking when in its inaugural stage,
Some years Slnce.
Letters were also read, excusing their absence, from the Proprietor
of ENo's Fruit Salt, the Antiguan Minister, Messrs. CRoss E AND
BLACKWELL, the Chairman of the Isle of Wight Railway Company
Mr. ALFRED G. WANCE, the Beadle of the Burlington Arcade, an
other earnest and enthusiastic supporters of recognised Dramatic
Education.
In opening the proceedings, Lord WHARNCLIFFE, who was visibly
affected, said he had a very painful task to perform. (“Iſear!”) He
had to announce to the assembled company the final dissolution and
disappearance of their long-cherished scheme. In a word, the
unhappy and ill-starred School of Dramatic Art was no more.
(Loud cheers.) He thanked them for that, manifestation. It
gave him courage to proceed. The story, however, was a very
simple one. The three pupils—and he reflected that all the immense
advantages offered by the excellent Institution now in, articulo
mortis, had succeeded in attracting only three pupils (loud laughter),
had all turned out badly. (Renewed laughter.) Their double-first
class man, the holder of the Barnes Aluminium Medal, and D'Oyly
Carte Scholar of his year, had been hooted off the stage, in Tripp, at
Sunderland, and was, when last heard of, he regretted to say, taking
the checks at the pit entrance of a well-known East-end Theatre.
(Loud laughter.) T. other two Students, though both anxious and
qualified tojº. as Hamlet at one of the leading houses, had not
yet succeeded in getting even an engagement. It appeared, there-
fore, that dramatic genius could not be implanted, after all, by the
same sort of process useful in inducing a mastery of vulgar fractions.
(A Voice : “You’ve got it.”). It was a humiliating confession
but he was bound to iſit that the most eminent Professors seem
to have failed to impart to their pupils any practical instruction
whatever. (Cries of “Oh, oh ''” and laughter.
The Regius Professor of Eccentric Attitude (Mr. IRVING) here rose
and asked the noble Chairman whether that remarkimplied any reflec-
tion on his own personal efforts. He insisted that he had had great
difficulties to contend with, owing to what he must characterise as
a ribald article in the Nineteenth Century, advising youthful
aspirants for the Stage to matriculate in Christmas Pantomime. By
this, he contended, a morbid ambition had been developed among well-
born novices to fill the rài of Číown. (“Bear, hear!”) Gentlemen
might cheer, but he could only add that, prepared as he was to
elucidate any comic business whatever, from the double, side-rally
as utilised by him in his Romeo, down to the window-shutter leap of
his Othello, he stopped there. He considered that the Professor of
Elocution was the legitimate exponent of the º meaning and
emphasis necessary to an effective “Here we are ſ” (“Oh, oh”
and cheers.)

BALLAD BY A BETTING
MAN.
AnothFR year I’ve lived to see
Once more a Derby Day;
Self-questioned, “Is it well with
me P”
Can I make answer, “Yea”?
Do I, with steadfast hope imprest,
Believe I’m bound to win,
Feel conscious of a mind at rest,
Experience peace within P
Am I persuaded I have got
A sure and certain ti
From one who knoweth what is
what ; -
A seer who cannot slip 2
I trust I’ve made my book aright,
And cannot come to grief;
Else, peradventure, now I might
Turn over a new leaf.
Besides, I’ve hedged—the wary
course
Is oft the wiser plan;
There's oft no getting at a horse:
No nobbling e'en a man.
But having reckoned all my bets,
The winner in the end,
On losers dubbing up their debts
0 dear, may I depend ?
Them nought but Honour can
compel,
The Law won't force, to pay.
And shall I find that all is we
In sooth on Settling Day ?
PLEASANT DERBY SAYINGs. To
an Owner.—“I want to back
your horse, and will, if you will
tell me honestly and candidly
whether you intend him to try
to-day, or not.”
To a Trainer.—“I must con-
gratulate you on the appearance
of your animal; but really is it
true, what everybody is saying,
that you yourself gave him two
buckets of water before he came
into the paddock P” ** GOING !
Mr. HAMILTON AfDf here rose. He said he had not long since
entered himself at the College, desirous of taking his degree as Pan-
taloon. Yet he had been expelled. He considered such treatment as
a gross outrage. (Uproar.). He repeated it. He had been uncere-
moniously “rusticated.” (Laughter.) .It was with a generous
jº. to swell the number of students, if only to the extent of one,
so to enable the Institution to make a better show to the public
when walking out two, and two, that he had enrolled himself for
instruction; though, he admitted, he had done so quite as an
amateur. (“Oh / oh!”
The Senior Warden (Mr. J. L. Tool.E) interposed. He said there
appeared to be some “most extraordinary” mistake. “Rustication”
merely meant a turn in the Provinces.
sure no offence was meant to the honourable undergraduate, by
sending him down for his little § to Lyme Regis. Honours at
Drury Lane would come later. Perhaps. (Laughter.) The last
speaker should remember that whatever he had

The Rev. Mr. BEDLAM said, that as a “professional” of very old

worthy Warden. And he would like to put in a word here. It was
this. Amateurs were the bane of this question. (Applause.) What

WAR TO THE KNIFE
IRELAND has suffered from
many curses. She has suffered
from conquest; she has suffered
from famine. She has suffered
from agitators; she has suffered
from rack-renters. Her melan-
choly history is written in many
strange ways and strange places.
The old hazard-table at the Kil-
dare Street Club-ploughed deep
with the furrows of human folly—
is one monument of her wretched
º: and more wretched present.
er life-blood has been drained
for the sustenance of gamblers
and drunkards. She has been
governed by fools; she has been
governed by rogues; and she is
now governed by thieves and cut-
throats. She has taken to the
knife. Her chosen patriots affect
to deplore this, though their
hands are morally as red as the
hands of the Three Anabaptists
in the Prophète. She has taken
to the knife. No indignation
meetings—no protests — no Mr.
O'CRoCO'DILE's tears can get rid
of this shameful fact. She has
taken to the knife — whether
butcher or bowie is not yet cer-
tain—as, before this, she took to
the revolver.
“Did you e'er have the luck to see
Donnybrook Fair?
An Irishman all in his glory is there !
With his Yankee revolver,
And knife up his sleeve'."
PLEASANT DERby SAYINGs. To

Luckily for their old Charters, the Copperashun has plenty of warm defenders

COURT AT LAST 1
A few remarks on “ The Parvenu; or, the Match-Making Mother
and the Magic Match-Bor.” . Also on “Lili” at the Variétés,
and Parisian Theatres generally.
CIRCUMsTANCEs towards which we stood in an attitude similar to
that of Mr. PARNELL towards the Ultra-Land-Leaguers, inasmuch
as they were beyond our control, prevented. us from seeing The
Parcenu till one night last week, when, we believe, it was close upon
its fiftieth representation, and therefore carried by a lucky breeze
out of reach of the deadly guns of criticism... We had read two or
three enthusiastic notices on its
first appearance, and since then
had received favourable reports
from fairly trustworthy sources,
so that we were prepared for a
piece which, if not absolutely a
work of dramatic genius, should
be at t well worth hearing
and seeing.
Its first and chief merit is that
it is not taken from the French ;
and therefore the French authors,
who have not been particularly
successful, on their own ground
lately, will not reap any ad-
vantage from Mr. GoDFREY’s
Parvenu.
As to its being “new and
Nº original,” it is about as much
that as any piece can be in
which such remarkably new
and original materials are em-
ployed as are represented by a
proud but wicked and impecuni-
ous Baronet, a match-making,
scheming mother, a daughter to be

Anson defying the g hani" Ready,” who proves
himself to be one of “Nature's noblemen; ” the inevitable “poor
artist” in love with and beloved by the heroine; and the heroine's
comic confidante, who is a relief to the sentimentality, and has to pair
off with the “Charles, his friend,” of the piece, called the “ Honour-
able Charles Tracey”—this sort of conventional character being
usually an “Honourable” and a “CHARLEs,” and brought in to act
the part of a chorus, say whatever good things may occur to the
Author, and make himself : useful. -
We had heard this piece described as “Robertsonian”-andif by a
“Robertsonian play” is meant a piece full of inconsistencies of
character and improbabilities of situation, of dialogue so broken up
as to sound like spasmodic efforts at conversation, of opportunities
for smoking on every possible oceasion, with one Act invariably
devoted to wearing evening dress, with a deal of out-of-door
life in the limelight, with love-making, sentimental and comio, then
is The Parvenu Robertsonian, and its Author a promising fourth-form
student of the Robertsonian School, as well as of Ours and Society.

ignorant of the ways of Society—a Society in which, from the
necessity of the plot, he is bound to move—than he appears to be.
Ridiculous he should be, but not improbable.
The conduct of the match-making mother, a woman of the world,
a schemer, a lady of rank (by marriage) and fashion, is simply im-
possible. A Miss Gusher, or some such name, writes to inform her
Butcher, Mr. SPARERIB ;
| last, and LAssoucHE ex-
appears, who happens to have in his pocket this Nobleman's silver
fuzee-box, on which are engraved its owner's crest and monogram.
On the strength of such evidence, this match-making mother, this
woman of the world, concludes that the Artist is the Nobleman in
disguise, forces her daughter upon him, invites him to stay in the
house, makes no inquiries whatever
about him, does not allow her husband
—a very knowing old man—to make
any, and breaks the engagement be-
tween the millionnaire and her daugh-
ter. So flimsy a motive does well
enough for a farce like The Wandering
Minstrel, but it would want all the
working-up of situation, individuality
of character, and witty dialogue that
o rises She Stoops to C. r
(which is the merest farce in plot) to
raise it to the rank of serious Comedy,
as we understand the word in English.
It is well *:::: decidedly well
played all round; though Mr. CLAYTox
is not suited as Charles his friend, and
Mr. FoEBEs Robertson, the emotional
Artist, talks like an Archdeacon in
disguise. Miss LottſE WENNE as the
daughter of Mr. Ledger, is capital in
eyerything she has to do...It is a sort
of Naomi Tighe part, which, in the
palmy days of the Robertsonian drama, would have fallen naturally
to Miss MARIE WILTON, at the Prince of Wales's Theatre, where
this }. with Mr. BANCROFT for drawling “Charles his friend,”
Mr. JoHN HARE as the Baronet, and JoHNNY CLARKE as the Parvenu,
would have been suited to perfection.
There is only one Scene for the three Acts, admirably painted by
Mr. PERKINs—but monotonous.
In Paris, a few days ago, we saw Mdme. JUDIC as Lili. , 8he sings
and acts charmingly throughout two Acts. But, in the third, where
a strong demand is made on her histrionic powers, her acting is not
equal to her singing.
She has to represent first -
a grandmother, then a
granddaughter. The
change is very rapid, to
the detriment of her
make-up as the old
woman, so that she sim-

cellent. They all have
the great French fault of taking the audience into their confidence
over the footlights; and BARON grossly exaggerated a small, and
not very good part, in order to extort laughs.
The piece is utterly unadaptable, thank goodness! as its chief
situation is about as grossly immoral as it can be; and, all questions
of the LoRD CHAMBERLAIN's licence and our Judic-ature apart, it
would be hissed off the Stage by an English audience. It is ap-
plauded to the echo by a French audience.

purchased by an English Manager. Not even fussy little DAUBRAY
can make anything of such a *; piece as La Brebis Egarée at the

Is “Pandora.” a good name for a theatre P In one
sense, yes; for a House where “all the gifts” are assem-
bled must be as remarkable as a Government of “all the
talents.” Such an All-gifted. Company would be in
itself a success. But the word taken in another sense,
“The All-Gift Theatre,” would rather point to a system
of “Orders,” or Free-Gratis-for-Nothing Theatre. Mr.
ALFRED THoMPson, under whose management this house
of entertainment is to be, is fond of “pans,” having
started a journal called Pan, and having looked after the
Panorama of Balaklava in the same building, which he
has now re-christened the “Pandora.” If he opens with
a comic opera, libretto by Mr. PottſNGER STEPHENs

When that Irish M.P., in a saturnine mood,
Makes a speech in the House, all sedition and blood,
That speech can his colleagues more strongly impugn
Than by saying, with shrugs, that it’s “inopportune”

So eager in laying the blame our poor backs on—
He calls such “denouncing” no better than shamming,
And swears that our game is to praise by faint damning!

“ARREARS.”
ARREARs It would seem there is nought but arrears,
Overdue from the bad, black, and blundering years,
The dragon-teeth seed-ground of militant hate,
Unwearied as Wengeance, relentless as Fate.
How freely, how gladly we’d hold forth the hand,
Ay, sow with our gold the bare wastes of that land,
If only love-prompted largesse had the power
Our Danaë to win by the aureate shower.
With joy how ungrudging we’d proffer the gi
If it might but avail the grim shadow to #ith
Which broods like a blight, and which clings like a curse,
And the best spells of hope hath the power to reverse.
That Shadow ! Unbanished, unlaid, it still lurks,
Black hate is its breath, and base deeds are its works;
With its pestilent presence possession to share
Is a thought beyond hope, the mad dream of despair.
Arrears! Yes, it may be arrears yet remain
Qf justice, of right, though our strength is a-strain
These long years with the effort, as earnest as strong,
To slay ancient hate and to right ancient wrong.
Again!. A last message of peace, or it seems
The last effort of patience. "What thrice-welcome gleams
Offair promise will greet us—the sole best reward
That we seek for our love, that we ask for our hoard?
Restitution? Not wholly; not ours all the blame,
All the burden of wrong, all the blazon of shame,
Time will write other verdict on history's page
Than that stigma of faction's unqualified rage.
What matter to-day? For to-day 'tis enough
That the hand is held forth. iº it meet #h rebuff?
Pure pity kills wrath, anger's stilled by regret.
Shall our hands meet in peace? There is time for it yet.
But the Shadow must pass, and the sinister brood
Who have wrought on a much-burdened people's mad mood.
With free help in sore need we would count but love's gains.
Then what room for the Terror whose foot-prints are stains?
Sure it's welcome you are, call it guerdon or gift,
If it only avail that foul Shadow to lift
From the meadows and mountains of Erin's green land,
The hate from her heart, and the blood from her hand!
THE HURLINGHAM HUMANE SOCIETY.
TALK about sport!. What sport is that of horse-racing to the sport
which “FULHAM” of that ill; writing to the Times, disparages as
“Cockney sport.”, “FullHAM” is evidently no sportsman. He thus
describes the results of the shooting by which the Hurlingham Club
has acquired a deserved celebrity:-
“We know indeed little of the delights of trying to kill a frightened tail-
less pigeon at so many yards. What we do know is that the wounded birds
flutter daily on to our roofs and shrubs, and possibly linger, there undisco-
vered for days; last year one was picked up, a living skeleton, a fortnight
after the last shooting-day of the season. The only persons who seem to
enjoy the sport besides the actual shooters are those little knots of roughs who
are daily to be seen humbly imitating their betters by pelting the wounded
birds from trees.”
What then? Are pigeons as sacred as guinea-pigs, or even as
rats and mice, except for purposes of Science? Are Hurlingham
Club sportsmen and shots on a level with experimental physiologists
in point of cruelty? Wiśl some of them are alsº members
of the Society for, the Total and Entire Abolition of Vivisection,
which, anyhow, allows Pigeon-shooting the sanction of silenge; Yet
sinceré Anti-Vivisectionists must at least wish it were possible that
pigeons could be shot under chloroform.

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
Tuesday, 4 A.M., May 23.-No one would think, to look at STAFFoRD
Nohracots as he sits spectacled and benevolent on Front Bench,
what depths of duplicity there are in him....Came down last night
burning with anxiety to discuss Arrears Bill... Conservative party
smouldering with same desire. All very well for GLAnstone to
ºr. one night would do for the debate. A week would scarcely
suffice. One night ridiculous.
This came out at early hour this morning; but the
way STAFFORD NORTHCOTE and the rest dissembled
all the evening, really appalling. Conservative
Benches empty. Debate nearly collapsed. Difficulty
in ... House sitting. Score of Members
yawning through exhilarating discourse of Mr. GRE-
GORY, and some profound philosophical reflections
from Sir Joseph McKENNA. Ministers and House
generally lulled into security. Expected Division
- at every moment. Then Sir STAFFORD comes in,
º Mºre throws off the mask, and discloses the true condition
and) Bill. of his mind, burning for further diseussion on the
Bill. Ministerialists rage; GLADSTONE storms: but no use. The
wily Conservative Leader, with hands meekly folded, and spectacles
dimmed with kindly emotion, bends his head to the storm.
Sails taken in on both sides, lee-scuppers stowed away, and all
made taut for dirty weather. Mr. JAMEs Lowth ER does violence to
his natural feelings, and flings himself into the fray. GLADston E
catches him by the hair, and worries him. CLAUD HAMILTON rushes
in, and declares his readiness to sit for twenty-four hours. Mr.
MAGFARLANE, with proud recollections of his feat on the opening
night of the Session, when he camped out in Palace Yard with a
noggin of whiskey and an oatmeal-cake and was first in his place,
says he will sit for twenty-five. Mr. LEwis declares he is good for
twenty-six. Sort of Parliamentary auction. “Going at twenty-
six Who says twenty-seven P’’
The Auctioneer hesitates. Mr. HENEAGE knocks Mr. CHAPLIN
down. CHAPLIN said that he
said that Lord RICHARD GRos-
VENOR had said—mark me,
Moorſ – that no division was
expected last night.
“No Hon. Member,” Mr.
HENEAGE declares, honest in-
* mantling his brow.
4 * a right to say what no
Hon. Member has not said.”
Thunderous cheers, though, on reflection
dubious. However, can't ºf to fathom it. Irish Members rush in.
“Are we going to sit here all night?” Mr. DILlwyn says, with his
head on one side, and a general air of putting a conundrum which had
Qeeurred to him after severe thought. Opposition guessed it imme-
diately, “Yes!” they roared, Mr. Diibwyn subsides, to think
of another, and much more difficult. Whilst he is cogitating, oom-
Fomise arrived at. , Government decide to take the Bill again at
orning Sitting, and Members go home. All this comes of STAFFORD
Northcore dissembling.
Business done.-Motion for Second Reading of Arrears Bill.
Tuesday Night.—After all the fighting last night, turns out no
Qhe had anything particular to say in continuance of debate. Yes,
|Mr. StoRER has ; and when Mr. ScLATea-Booth's Amendment is
negatived, Mr. StoRER rises. Just ten minutes to seven: barely
time to divide on main º as Sitting is suspended at seven.
Tremendous howl greets his placid appearance. Noise as if it were
eeding-time at the Zoological Gardens, and Storer the toothsome
morsel just out of reach.

do a thing like this... Stands timidly surveying the raging House.

Mr. WHITLEy's watch-chain. A gurgling sound is heard; some-
thing about “agricultural interests,” escapes his parched lips;
then Mr. STORER subsides, and Divison taken. This process of Par-
liamentary Debate watched with great interest from Gallery.
Business done.—Arrears Bill read a Second Time by 269 votes
against 157.
Wednesday Afternoon.—Rumour about º that DICK Power
has been offered the place of Junior Whip. Not likely to be true.
In some respects too good to be true. In others not desirable. Irish
Members must have a Whip, and it would be difficult for any man to
succeed DICK Power, and make himself acceptable to the House.
As Mr. RICHARD PEDDIE says, “If, in the House of Commons, a
man's called “JACK' or ‘Drck,’ be sure he's a good fellow.” Cer-
tainly holds good with respect to DICK PowRR. And, look you, it's
not an easy thing for a man to be Whip to the Land-League Party,
and be §º popular on both sides of the House.
Met O'SHEA in the corridor leading down to back of Speaker's
Chair. Thought I'd ask him, as he knows everything. But O'SHEA

several other great Statesmen. Éverything done in best º:
regardless of expense. Muffins perhaps a little over-buttered, but
tea excellent, and cream of best London make. After tea, looked
into this Prevention of Crime Bill. Can't let GLADSToxE go on in
this way.
“Must put him down,” DILLw YN says, with his mouth full of
muffin and true Liberalism.
“If he'd been little more careful in his selection—thank you, yes,
I will have a seventh cup,” said PETER—“in his seleetion of Under-
secretaries, it would have been much better for him and the Country.
What is wanted either at the Colonial Office or Board of Trade, is a

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
THE IRISH DEFECTIVES.
THESE gentlemen have amused the
Public for some weeks with imaginary
“clues,” and have probably spent a
small fortune in telegrams and cable-
grams. They have caused the arrest
in various parts of the world of a
number of penniless vagabonds, who
have been discharged in a few hours
after accounting for their poverty.
The newspapers have .d. their
efforts in a most admirable manner.
Every “clue” has had the honour of
sensational type, and assertions made
in one number have been duly con-
tradicted in another. In one case the
assertion and contradiction appear
together, though scarcely with the
same prominence. New York has
been worked with great activity, but
has Dublin been overhauled in a
workmanlike manner? The “slums.”
have doubtless been exhausted, but
this was not a crime of the “slums.”
The men that are “wanted” eat,
drink, and make merry, and are pro-
bably treated every night in some
place of amusement, as HANLAN
would be treated in a London Music
Hall after one of his victories.
Music in Hyde Park from Five to

THE GREAT PAUPER COUNTRY.
IRELAND is to have a clean slate, and, as usual, at the expense
chiefly of the British Taxpayer. that atient Jackass is to be
saddled with another burden. The rent which the Irish malcontent
can't, or won't pay, and which the Irish Landlord probably ought
not to receive, is to be partly paid by the hard-working, over-
taxed, and much-abused Saxon. If the Saxon will indulge in the
luxury of keeping a prodigal son, the Saxon must nºt grumble at
the expense of the luxury. No one is disposed to underrate such a
blessing as Davitt, but DAVITTs, may be bought at too high a figure.
The pauperisation of Ireland will be the demoralisation o England.

A HANDBOOK TO KNOWLEDGE.
No. III.-The STREETs of LoNDON.
Q. What is a Street?
A. A Street is a thoroughfare designed for the recreation of
roughs, the diversions of Westries, Gas Companies and Boards of
Works, and the amusement of Advertisers.
Q. Are no other sections of the public possessed of rights and
interests in our Streets P
A. Secondarily and upon sufferance perhaps; but their claims
are quite subordinate to those of the classes first specified.
Q. Are there not various sorts of Streets P
A. Many. -
Q. How would you classify them P
A. No known principle of classification would apply to them in
their entirety, but several kinds of Streets may be named, e.g. :-
1. The Street which is never repaired, and is therefore always
impassable.
. The Street which is always being repaired, and is therefore
always equally impassable.
. The Street which leads nowhere.
. The Street which always leads back into itself again.
. The Street which leads to a Market or a Railway Station,
which many desire to approach, and which consequently is
always blocked and beastly.
. The Street with so narrow a footway that a wayfarer adven-
turing therein is exposed always to inevitable dirt, and
generally to imminent danger.
. The Street whose footway is always so crowded by costers,
roughs, and loiterers, that the wayfarer who would make
lºgº. is compelled to walk in the gutter.
The Street of exceeding narrowness, into which Cabmen from
all quarters will continually and eagerly converge, as a
“short cut,” remaining there blocked many minutes in the
vain but inveterate hope of saving one.
9. The Street where the Shopkeepers bestrew the bulk of their
wares on the pavement, or on poles, &c., outside their shops,
so that you are likely to have your hat dislodged by a flap-
ping carpet, or to stumble over a coalscuttle or a pile of
crockery.
10. The Street which is a sort of unchartered Alsatia, and given
up wholly to drunken women and roughs.
11. The Street which is all oyster-shells . dirty children.
12. The Street which is no Street at all, but only a noisome cul-
!. beginning with a beerhouse, and ending in a dust-
ea
:
Q. How § you account for these several specialities of our
Streets -
A. They are the result of the varied and uncontrolled humours of
the irresponsible wags—called Builders, Contractors, Road-makers,
Municipal and Parochial Boards, Constables, &c., &c.—who are
charged with their construction, supervision, and guardianship.
Q. What would you consider to be the most general and striking
characteristic of a London Street P
A. Dirtiness.
f (Q. Are any provisions made for the cleansing of our thorough-
ares
A. Many very expensive ones.
Q. How are these applied ?
A. Either quite capriciously, or upon the principle of being least
used when most needed, and rice rersø.
Q. Mention some of the results of this system.
A. That, in fine weather, one Street will be as dry and dusty as
Sahara, the next as swamped and sloppy as a fish-market. That, in
wet weather, most Streets are Malebolges of mud, in one or other of
its two conditions of glutinous slime and gruelly slop. That, after a
heavy snow-storm, a London thoroughfare furnishes worse travelling
than a Yorkshire Moor in midwinter.
Q. Next to their dirtiness, what should you say was the most
obvious peculiarity of London Streets?
A. The frequency with which they are “up.”
Q. What do you mean by a Street being “up” P
A. It is the term colloquially applied to that condition of tumul-
tuous and perilous chaos caused by the operations of paving, drain-
age, and the laying or repairing of gas and water mains.
Q. What appearance does a Street present in these circumstances?
A. That of a combination of Builders'-yard, Cemetery, and
Gravel-pit, which has been subjected to the action of a local
earthquake. -
Q. On what principle are these various operations performed by
the several bodies responsible for their execution
A. On the principle of “One down and tºother come on,” with a
view, apparently, to making the condition of chaos as chronic as
possible. When, for example, the road or footways are not being
repaired, the sewers or the gas and water-pipes are. And, again,
when one Nº. Bridge is “up” upon one pretext, it is care-
fully arranged that one other Bridge shall also be “up” on another.
Q. What further strikes you as regards our London Streets?
A. The extent to which the London “Rough " monopolises their
advantages, and subordinates the convenience, comfort, and even
safety of the General Public to his own profit and amusement.
Q. In what does his profit consist P
A. In violently appropriating the property of the Public.
Q. And his amusement P
A. In annoying the Public by all the devices of lumbering
obstruction, foul language, and brutal º,
Q. Is no provision made against his too free indulgence in these
enjoyments?
A. The Police are—by some gentle optimists—supposed to “keep
an eye” on him. But that “eve" being generally very “far ”
indeed, and, when “near,” chiefly engaged in threatening honest
flower-girls and commanding small boys, the Rough is most fre-
quently and in most places master of the situation, and free to act
out the favourite Street-drama, known as “The Three Stages of
Ruffianism.”
Q. What are these three stages 2
A. Brutal skylarking, drunken bestiality, and homicidal violence.
Q. Are no restrictions placed by Authority upon the use—or
abuse—of the public thoroughfares? -
A. Many. For example, an inexperienced stranger pausing to
look at a passing show, a girl attempting to sell a bootlace or a
bunch of violets, a homeless outcast trying to snatch a short sleep on
a little-used doorstep, an innocent wayfarer fainting from privation
or disease, all these are extremely liable to be “moved on ” with
churlish indignity, or “run in " with indiscriminate violence. . But
there are certain classes who are the chartered libertines of the
London Streets.
Q. Name some of these. -
A. Exceptional privileges appear to be reserved for the following-
1. The Bumbledom . blocks and bemuddles.
2. The Ruffianism that revolts and endangers. ..
3. The flaunting Vice that obstructs and demoralises.
4. The carelessness that befouls and imperils. , (As instanced by
the dirty idiots who cast orange-peel, and more objection-
| able filth, upon the pavements.)
5. Last—but, in these days, scarcely least—the “colossal.”

“WE shall be quite game to go to the Theatre, my dear BoB,”

they should patronise a TEMPLE of THESPIs. “True in old days
JERRY and I only took an occasional glimpse at the play at ‘Old
Drury,’ and a look at the Stage at Covent Garden Theatre; but since
our object is life and improvement, we will accept your invitation.”
“Ah!” said young Bob, looking rather nonplussed, “I think I can
promise you life at the play, but I am not so sure about improve-
ment.” “Well,” said the Čomstmas, “so long as there are gay
moments, all will be ‘merry as a marriage bell; ’, but have you no
KEMBLE, KEAN, or MACREADY to interpret with histrionic skill the
genius of SHAKSPEARE, and render the Bard of Avon truly sublime f *
“Oh,” said young LogIC, “if it's SHAKSPEARE you want, you must
i. to another shop, and not to the theatre I am aiming at. Fact is,
on't you know, we consider the Bard quite played out, nowadays.
Give you my word that those fellows who write burlesques can beat
im easy; and hang me if I think The FARREN or The WAUGHAN
would condescend to play in him.” “You astonish me, Bob,” said
the CoRINTHIAN. “Where then is this theatre, the players at which
are above SHAKSPEARE; I am quite curious to see it. “So am I,’”
cried JERRY. “I agree with my Coz, and though I never read
SHAKsPEARE myself, we had a large copy at Hawthorn Hall, and I
have always heard my father say, that though he did “get into
trouble' for poaching, when a boy, he was a most meritorious
writer.”
“There is only one theatre in London,” said * LoGIC,
“patronised by the “Boys,’ and that is the Gaiety. It is managed
by Mr. John Hollingshead, better known as Practical JoHN, and
he is truly a remarkable man. He is equally at home at writing an
article, or unditing a letter to the newspapers, in chaffing the ‘Board
of Works,' or introducing the Electric Light to London, and he
would at a moment's notice undertake to do the work of the
ARCHIBISHOP of CANTERBURY, or the LoRD CHANCELLOR, or assume
the Command of the Channel Fleet.” “Bless me!” cried CoRINTHIAN
ToM, “you amaze me, such a man is thrown away on a theatre; he
ought to be ‘serving his country’ in Parliament, and not leading a
Mug-cutting Company.” Thus, when the time arrived, ToM and
JERRY were quite ready to accompany young
Bob to this “much-talked-of” theatre. They
found a great crowd at the door, but as their
seats had been booked, they were free to enter,
and when they did so, an unsurpassable scene
met their optics. First, their attention was
drawn to the folks in the Stalls. These
seemed chiefly joung men, with very shing
hair, and beautiful linen, very tight collars, and
very sloping foreheads, who sat sucking large
knob-sticks, and gloating over the scenes on the
Stage. Here was young ALDERSHOT, juvenile
Oxford, or QAMBRIDGE, in short, all the “men
about town” of the day, the gommeuz of the
age, and their, appearance might have afforded
reflection to the philosopher. Vacuity and
“Coming out” at the Gaiety.

TOM, JERRY, AND YOUNG LOGIC AT THE PLAY.
solemnity were their prevailing characteristics, and though they
seemed to be º: the play, they “took their pleasure sadly,” as
if life had nothing to give but one more pun, one more dance, and
one more burlesque. K HUxLEY would have found among them
many near relations to the Monkey, and a DARWIN would have
espied “The Missing Link.”
Quite as curious, in its way, as an example of “LIFE IN
LoNDoN,” was the entertainment provided on the Stage. It was
called a Burlesque-Drama, and had a good deal of the former, and
very little of the latter in it, while it seemed to the uninitiated eyes
of Tomſ and JERRY, to be a series of scenes of which they could not
make “head or tail.”. But young Logic seemed to know all about
it, and assured them it was quite the best thing out, while the solemn
Yºung mºn seemed to enjoy it as much as they could appreciate any
‘bit of life.” The Company was a clever one, and such men as
TERRY and Royce were equal to JoEY MUNDEN, Mºrrºws, LISTON,
or HARLEY, while several young women danced with grace, and some
acted with spirit. , Misses FARREN, WAUGHAN, and GILCHRIST were,
young Bob pointed out, the heroines of “the show,” and he said he
considered them real actresses. That, indeed, seemed to be the
opinion of the Crowd, for encores were frequent, and many a
bouquet was “hurled” over the footlights to . rewarded with a
smile, though, as ToM remarked, it had to be distributed over so
many adorers, that it would hardly “go round.” “We have seen
Miss TREE, Madame WESTRIs, and Miss O'NEIL, and heard Miss |
KELLY, and Miss STEPHENs, my dear LoGIC,” said the CoRINTHIAN,
“and we are glad to see your beau idéal of the acting of the
#.it is infinitely refreshing, and let us hope it will expand the
mind.”
The most curious “bit of life” seen that evening was, however, yet
to be experienced. “Let’s go round to the Stage-door,” said *:
LoGIC, " and see the girls come out.” “Certainly,” said the
CoRINTHIAN, who had observed that young LOGIC was a great
admirer of the fair sea. “You have friends, I presume, among the
corps de ballet.”, “Oh, dear, no,” said young LoGIC, “but it’s ‘the
thing’ to do, and some of the fellows know that dark girl in the
third row. She ought to play Juliet, she ought. I’m sure she’s
clever enough.” So the TRIO went round to the
Stage-door, and there was a crowd of . our
friends from the Stalls standing near the door,
over which shone “THE SACRED LAMP of BUR-
LEsquE.” 'Twas a strange sight, and charac-
teristic of the age, to see those young men watch
the “ladies” come out. These youths, ToM
remarked, had been called the “jeunesse-stage-
doorey of the period,” whereupon JERRY ob-
served that “he hoped his Cousin would not catch
the infection of punning from the burlesque.”
Some held bouquets which they offered as the
hansoms, growlers, and broughams droye away
with LILY, or ToTTIE, or Poppy, and the mºon
looked down with a sly glance at this very cari-
ous bit of “MoDERN #. IN LONDON.”

“LATHER-DAY SAINTs.”
(FROM THE well-KNowN MEDLEvaL MURAL DEcoRATIVE ADVERTISEMENT BY
TRADE MARKs, R.A.)
AT THE HORSE-SHOW.
. THE Horse-Show at Islington is a peculiarly British institution, like tall hats, trial by
§ and the morning tub. For we are a horsey people, and on the Continent every
nºishman is supposed to be a judge of horses, although he may happen not to know
fetlocks from º and pasterns from Pºiº We are indeed very fond of
horses, although we have not yet, as CALIGULA did, made one a Magistrate, although we
frequently utilise donkeys for this office, even in Middlesex. Three great rides have been
celebrated in immortal º and verse—those of TURPIN, Mazeppa, and Gilpin; and where
is the man who does not feel for the latter, seeing that all the time he was careering up and
down, his dinner was, being spoiled. Now, the racers and hunters of the day may lack
the vates sacer, and only live in the memories of bookmakers, but still we cling as fondly
as ever to horseflesh; and though we cannot all be ALExANDERs, we can at i. fancy
that we #. Bucephalus.
The Horse-Show, then, represents the national taste, and no wonder it is so popular:
It is graced, every year by the presence of Royalty; and last week the Prince and Princess of
WALEs, and twº of their daughters, went to see the leaping. The ponies were much admired,
especially Mr. DUPONT's little black pony, Lady Jumbo, a Circassian, which is more like a
rat than anything else, being only thirty inches high. This mite took the fancy of the little
Princessºs very much, and was heartily cheered when it leapt a tinyhurdle, One thing must
be noted, which it is to be hoped will not happen again. Many of the animals paraded
before the spectators had tight bearing-reins, a fact which we commend to the attention
was proved
to be wholly unnecessary—a hint which may
be taken by some of our low comedians-
by the presence of other horses without it:
It is scandalous that bearing-reins should
be permitted at such an Exhibition ; and
the Judges should promptly disqualify any
animal appearing before them with one on.

exclaimed one of the Judges, Sir C. Piggott,
who immediately explained to Mr. HANMER

between the horse's colour and the river

“Very good,” observed Lord LoNspair,

an extraordinary sea monster, said to be about 150 feet in length, and which was supposed to be a
species of giant cuttlefish or octopus.”
Evidently the monster was brought up, close to shore by the Whitsun holiday-tide, and
dared to show itself when the coast was quite clear in the absence of Parliamentary. Intelli-
gence. If Egyptian and Irish affairs should grow dull, we shall look forward with interest to
the report of a “Fearful Struggle with a Gigantic Gooseberry off the Coast of Greenland.”
Sea-Serpents and others will accept this intimation, and . wire to our office, where
any information as to their movements will be thankfully received.
Mas. RAMsborham AND THE Egyptian DIFFICULTY-She knows all about it, and has got
the names so correctly. “The idea,” she exclaimed, “of a person called Tooth AcHE PASHA |
of course he’d give trouble. I should have him out or stopped at once.”

DILKE, by putting his head on one side and facing the guilty
Under-Secretary with magisterial air. “Take care, Sir, take care,”
he says to the PREMIER, by putting his spectacles on to bring him
under closer supervision.
Half-a-dozen others follow, then ASHMEAD-BARTLETT appears on
the scene. W. E. G., older in habits of deception, manages to conceal
his emotion ; but paper held in DILKE's hands visibly and audibly
trembled. DILKE tries to put A. B. off in old style; but not to be done.
Thanks to recent elision (for which see Gazette),
A. B. has been able to learn his brother's name off

THE ADJUTANT'S HORSE.
(From the Diary of a Militia Training.)
First Week,-Got a new charger from the cab-yard, My last
ear's mount is now permanently engaged churning clay in a brick-
eld. Present animal has his faults—gone in the knees, hollow back,
and Roman nose. Still, he is as gentle as a lamb. Good pedigree,
too. Cab-proprietor says that Staggers (my horse) had a cousin
who once shared the same stable with a half-bred Arab. Found
Staggers a little awkward at starting at first., However, my orderly
suggested that if he made a noise like the slamming of the door of
an omnibus, and called out sharply, “Higher up!” the charger
would move on. Orderly perfectly right. † seems to like
the music of the band, and always walks on his d legs when the
Regimental March (“The Vagabond.”) is played. Qrderly says he
remembers him doing that in a booth at a country fair twelve years
ago. On the whole, am fairly satisfied with my bargain.
Second Week.-I am afraid that Staggers must have led a very
chequered career. He is always having embarrassing reminiscences
of the past. For instance, the other day, when the Regiment was
engaged in a “march out,” we met a funeral. Staggers imme-
diately quitted the battalion, and took up his place at the near-side
leader in front of the hearse. Again we are training in the country
this year, and often, have some, skirmishing drill on the sands.
Staggers, noticing a i.º. one morning rather far out,
immediately walked through the water to it, and backed into the
shafts | e could not get him to rejoin “Ours” until he had taken
it out. Again, on passing a common where Excursionists were en-
joying themselves, he took up his place amongst some animals
striki º resembling himself, under a placard, bearing the legend,
“A really good ride, for one penny!” All this is very annoying,
and I am continually being called upon to give my “reasons in
writing” for my charger's eccentric behaviour.
Third Week.--Took Staggers to target-practice. All went well
until the first shot was fired, when the brute turned round .#
three times, and then fell down, F. to be dead! My orderly
says he remembers him }% the very same thing five-and-twenty
years agº in the Battle ºf Waterloo at Aºtley's. Myºman addedi.it
used to be his “cue” to recover when the Clown offered hi “a
lass of sherry wine.” As we had no means at hand of ſº him.
is “cue,” we were forced to leave him on the ground. . He was
driven home subsequently by a costermonger, harnessed tandem with
a donkey. With this little exception, Staggers behaved admirably
during the whole week. , I have nothing to complain of except his
custom of invariably, taking up his place, behind the last vehicle
when we pass a cab-stand, from force of habit. But this is not yery
noticeable, as my position as Adjutant on the march is in rear of the
battalion. However, I wish he wouldn't do it !

Fourth Week.-Really, I have got through my training very
leasantly. Staggers, was not quite satisfactory at the Inspection.
F. to ride him in blinkers to prevent accidents, and to spur, him
vigorously when the battalion was passing a Tºbiºhºmsº After
the inspection, hard at work in the Orderly Room, and so did not go
out. On the last day, having returned to Head Quarters, trotted
Staggers back in mufti to the cab-yard. All the catsin the neighbour-
j followed me. Surprised at this, until cab-master (who lives
next door to a knacker's), suggested that perhaps the cats were fol:
lowing Staggers, because º thought I was going to kill him!
Said he had known it happen before. Cab-master promised me the
refusal of Staggers for the next training, subject of course to the
consent of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals:
Hope I shall get him, as he is certainly the best-looking animal I
have ridden for many years!
LA DAMALA AUX CAMELIAS ET LES AUTRES.
OF course there are some English plays to be seen in London, but
the “other people” for the most part are to be found listening to
French at the Gaiety, German at Drury
Lane, or Italian at Covent Garden,
where most of the company are Bel-
gians. Such is life on the English
Stage. The event of the day—that is,
of the Monday last week—was the
return to London of Madame SARAH
DAMALA BERNHARDT, accompanied by
M. SARAH DAMALA BERNHARDt. SARAH
was welcomed by a brilliant Salle.
She was warmly received with five
bouquets. . What became of the other

learning his lesson;
but on Wednesday

Madame BERNHARDT's

To the Owner of a Winning Horse.—I congratulate you on the
easy manner you won, and I º are prepared with a defence.
Eh? Oh, haven't you heard? y, a member of the Jockey Club
has just told me, that the Stewards are going to have you up, to
explain the in-and-out running of your horse. Of course, I know
you are innocent; but I may as well tell you that popular feeling is
very much against you.
To the Occupants of a Regimental Drag.—Thanks. Capital
lunch; wine perhaps a trifle too sweet, and I am sorry I was so late.
Really, you know, when I first saw this drag, with yºu on it, I took
it for the turn-out of someiocal volunteers.” Taftāī
To a Mistaken Backer.—Yes, I'll have a glass of the Boy with
}. to celebrate that last victory. Thanks. Health ! Very good
oy, indeed. But I say, old chappie, you asked me to take you, a
1000 to 60 about the winner. What a mistake it was to limit the
price! I was a bit late in the Ring, and the best offer I could get
was 1000 to 80, so I did not put a penny on for you.
To a Lady.—Your dresses are always charming; but what I
admire even more, is your careful economy. It is not everybody
who can discover that the dress you are wearing to-day is the one we
all admired at the Oaks so much.

FEw great scientific discoveries have escaped the clutches of the

bantling in its scientific form—an infant essentially in a state of
pupillage—it is not yet exactly the one entire and perfect chrysolite.
And yet every morning sees the creation of a new “Will-o'-the-
Wisp " Company, formed to acquire rights that have no existence,
to promise fabulous dividends, and the regeneration of the human
race, and to steal the capital of the greedy fools who fish in phantom
waters. The light that is destined to turn night into day will
survive this degradation, as its twin brother, the electric ºil
survived a similar attack, but the struggle with human folly will
be long and hard.

This sounds uncommonly like a Salvation Army announcement. Is
it possible that the Dean and Chapter have enlisted, and that the

REMARKABLE ROMANCES.
(By a Rambler.)
No. W.--THE CRITIC.
MR. CHIFFONIER PRIggs, of Peckham Rye, was born a man—no, I
mean, a baby of letters. His father knew, the moment that he gazed
upon his abnormally developed head, that
CHIFFONIER was destined to become a
MACAULAY, a SHAKSPEARE, or a SAMUEL
Johnson; but his mother secretly in-
clined to the belief that she had brought
into the world a future Bishop or Dean
of the Established Church. Thus it
was that almost before he could speak,
CHIFFONIER knew that he was to
be a GREAT MAN. To do him justice,
he at once realised the responsibilities
incurred by his position. Instead of
wasting his time at marbles, he would
ponder over the cardboard globes in his
father's study; while other boys were
indulging in cricket, CHIFFONIER was
delivering stump orations to his little
sisters in the back garden; and when his
associates were making the air hideous
with penny whistles, Jew's harps, and
papered combs, he was practising the Triangles of Euclid, or ºf
the opera of QUINTUs HoRATIUS FLACCUs, P. OvIDIUs NAso, an
other deceased blowers of their own trumpets.
In this way CHIFFONIER grew # to be good and yirtuous. He
was never birched or caned, and if occasionally the shoe leather of
his sehoolfellows was brought into yiolent contagt with his own
broadcloth, it must be set down to the fact that they were of that
common and vulgar earth, which furnishes the world with its
ordinary citizens. You cannot make porcelain from brickmaker's
clay; . On each and every occasion, when he suffered, CHIFFONIER
would enter the particulars in his diary. -
“They will be of great service,” he would say to himself, “when
my juvenile. experiences come to be recorded in the Boyhood of
Great Men.” .
Though studious, he was, however, by no means plodding, for he
was aware that Genius is never thus. It was only when the days of
Examination approached that he would gorge his mind with facts
and figures, so as to enable him to bear home pretty, gilt-edged,
calf-bound volumes to his delighted parents. Had his father not
died before his preparatory education was completed, he would cer-
tainly have gone up to one of the two leading Universities. . This
was the more provoking, as, had he honoured Oxford with his choice,
he would without doubt have carried off the Newdigate, inasmuch
as he had discovered himself to be a Dramatic Poet of no mean order.
The time for a first-class being of this kind had, he argued with
himself, come round in the cycle of events. SHAKSPEARE had been
dead for these three hundred years, and no one had yet been born to
compete for the pride of place with the Bard of Avon. CHIEFoni ER
PRIggs resolved not to shirk the contest. He therefore set to work
on a play which should earn for him the income of a patent-
ºne-monsº, and the posthumous honours of Westminster
ey.
When the magnum opus was finished (it took PRIGGs at least three
weeks to write), he read it at a solemn family conclave. There were
resent his mot er. his sisters, and his uncle and guardian, who had
ately threatened “to make that young jackanapes put his shoulder
to the wheel, and do something for a living.” The piece was in six
Acts, and in blank verse. It was called Columbus. The Author
deliyered his speeches with coolness and fervour and pathos. His
mother applauded and his sisters laughed in the wrong places, but
is avuncular relative preserved a stony silence, and stolidly dr
gin and water. At the end of the fifth Act, however, he knocked
the ashes out of his pºp". and asked, “When are we coming to the
disgovery of America fº - -
“That is far too vulgar an incident for my drama,” replied CHIF-
FONIER, loftily.
“Might I inquire,” continued his uncle, “why your characters
don't speak the Queen's #. ?” ...
: Great heavens!” cried PRIggs, “it’s blank verse!” ... ...
“It’s the blankest verse I ever listened to,” snorted the Philistine,
“and into my counting-house you go to-morrow.”
...And in truth in less than a week CHIFFQNIER was perched on a
high stool, entering the #. of currants and sago in a ledger.
‘CHATTERTON,” he whispered to a fellow clerk, “was not more
apprºgiated than I am.”
“Was it before he took Drury Lane Theatre P” asked the other.
CHUFFQNIER only shuddered, - - - - - -
But despite his mercantile pursuits, he did not abandon his strivings

after stage-effect. He even descended from his lofty pinnacle and
gallantly bombarded Managers to no purpose, as many a deserted
pigeon-hole and crammed waste-paper basket could tell, were they
gifted with speech, with comedies, farces, and burlesques. He fre-
#. the society of Actors, and got himself elected to a so-called
Theatrical Club, where he sat up all night, casuistically and causti-
cally pointing out the obvious demerits of the pieces then running.
Here it was that he made the acquaintance of one, FLOATs, the
Manager of a Playhouse, and of GRUBLEY, the Editor of the Griffin.
Now it so º that FLOATs, having had six successive
failures written by six eminent Dramatists, and having by him a
French play which he wanted cheaply and *. rendered into
English, under, the influence of despair and brandy-and-water,
intrusted the adaptation to CHIFFonſert. The young man felt that
the time had come, and set to work at once with the ardour of
HANNIBAL, and the certainty of a NAPoleon. Not *...*. he
flattered himself, when he had eliminated all the coarse Gallic
humour, and when he had Anglicised all the charactersby converting
them into Lords and Ladies, Baronets, Squires, and other ingredients
of what is known as Society. And of course he took care to make use of
much of the beautiful poetry which he had composed for Columbus.
atu 3. sundry improbable situations and impossible complications
remained, but it is unlikely that a strong suspicion of a breach of
the Seventh Commandment should have been thereason why Manager
FLOATs was provided with a Seventh failure. But so it was, the
spectators stoned the play to death, and the critics danced with glee
upon the corpse.
CHIEFoxLER felt, that the sorrows of Jop and WERTHER were but
flea-bites compared with his. For six weeks he mourned with a face
as long as a double-bass, and led the sad life of a hermit of old,
graving as it were for death. At last, finding that his dissolution
did not come, he ventured back to the Club, and marvelled greatly
tº find that no one even remembered the title of his abortive dramatic
effort. So he plucked up his spirits, called for poached eggs and
stout, and let his tongue run loose with the satiric freedom of former
days. At last he and GRUBLEY, the Editor, were left at cock-crow
with no other companions than empty glasses, cigar-ends, and two
yawning waiters. --
“You seem to talk a great deal about what you don't understand,
said the Editor. “It strikes me that you’re just the man I want.
My dramatic critic is leaving me; would you care to have a try for
his shop?” - -
CHIFrontRR's feet swelled in his boots, and a button flew off his
waistcoat, at the offer. He even forgave, in his gladness, the un-
º opening of GRUPLEY's address.
“I will do my best,” he cried. -- -
“Good!” said the other. “There’s an Original Comedy coming
out to-morrow at the Peristyle. Let me see what you can do
with it.”
PRIggs did this with it:-
“Since the days of Mrs. APHRABEHN and George Colman the
Younger, the specific qualities necessary for the realisation of Art in
its dramatic form have scarcely ever been thoroughly develo 11
that degree which is at once agreeable to the not too captions taste of
the ordinary playgoer, and to the more eclectic discrimination of the
Critic. Art, to {: Art, must be Art and not Artifice. The hedge-
sparrow, in the hands of an experienced cordon bleu, may make a
salmi calculated to deceive the vulgar, but it can no more obtain
with the connoisseur as the ortolan or beccañco, than can a Wardour
Street "pot-boiler’ pass muster for a masterpiece by PETER PAUL
RUBENs or WILLIAM MALLond TURNER. The new comedy, Water-
nymphs, though enthusiastically received by, to say the least of it,
a very friendly audience, is mediocre beyond, mediocrity. Scarcely
have we done laughing at a situation or a joke, when we remember
that the same joke and the same situation might very possibly have
done duty scores of times before. Indeed, to call, W.º: all.
‘originalſ’ work is about its only original attribute. Qriginality, to
be original, must strike us with the freshness of a prismatic

A HANDBOOK TO KNOWLEDGE.
No. IV.-THE WAITER.
Q. What is a Waiter P
A. An Attendant for whom one has to wait.
Q. Was that the original meaning of the word?
A. No ; it originally signified one who waited upon others. But
that sense of the word is almost obsolete.
Q. How is this singular inversion to be accounted for P
ti :* many ways. Among contributing causes may be men-
1Oneol :-
1. The spread of that particular sense of dignity which mani-
fests itself in cold abstraction of gaze and lofty indifference
of demeanour.
2. The growing interest in that which used to be described as
“the sport of Kings,” but may now better be described as
the chief business of Waiters—viz., horse-racing.
3. The fascinations of female converse:
4. The exigences of the toilet, more particularly in respect of
moustaches and finger-nails.
Q. What is commonly the first effect of calling a Waiter ?
A. Instantaneous development of stone-deafness on his part.
Q. How is this singularly sudden affliction manifested ?
A. By his gazing at you with an expression of tranged immobility,
or turning his back upon you and solicitously folding a super-
numerary serviette into the shape of a cocked hat, or fleur-de-lis.
Q. If you raise your voice, what follows :
A. His rapid retreat to the farther end of the apartment.
Q. On what errand P
A. None.
Q. What should be the would-be diner's next proceeding P
A. That depends upon his physical gifts. If he should happen to
possess an unusually powerful voice, an imperative and staccato
summons, several times repeated, may, eventually, bring the errant
one slowly and reluctantly to his elbow. If his vocal powers are
small, or should he object to public declamation, his only course is to
wait patiently until the Waiter chances to be strolling again in his
direction.
Q. When again within vocal range, what is usually the Waiter's
next proceeding P
A. To blow down the back of your neck?
Q. What is the reason of this action ?
A. Research has not yet discovered whether it is a mystic pro-
fessional rite, or a subtle form of vengeance.
Q. But what if you remonstrate against this annoyance 2
A. He does it again, under cover of an apology.
Q. Are all Waiters subject to this disorder P
A. Not in this precise form. Some simply snort at you, others
whisper confidentially and odorously in your ear; others, again, kick
the legs of your chair, or ruffle your back-hair with their elbows or
table-napkins; but all these are shrewdly supposed to be varied
symptoms of the same disorder, “a malady most incident to.”—
Waiters, the roots of which are to be found in clumsiness combined
with self-conceit.
Q. What is the Waiter's next proceeding P
A. To perform the ceremony known as “taking your orders.”
Q. In what does this consist P
A. Mainly in prolonged interrogation and ingenious miscon-
struction.
Q. Explain this.
A. No self-respecting Waiter will grasp the meaning of your
commands without many repetitions of his shibboleths, “Hay, Sir P”
and “Wotsy, Sir?” or having—apparently-grasped that meaning,
carry them out without such modifications and perversions as com-
mend themselves to his independent judgment or his sense of
humour.
Q. Having approximately realised your desires, what does he
next proceed to do?
A. Bring you what you have—or have not–called for, in instal-
ments, at intervals as long as possible, taking care, for example,
that the potatoes shall by no means accompany the meat, and that
the peas shall not come until the potatoes are cold.
Q. What does he do during these intervals P
A. This is a mystery that cannot be solved with certainty. It has,
however, been conjectured that he may occupy the time in composing
epics, or travelling in foreign parts.
Q. What other specialities of the craft can you mention?
A. There are many, including those common to the class, and
those peculiar to the individual. The Hotel Waiter, the Restaurant
Waiter, and the Waiter at public dinners have, each of them,
peculiarities, manners, and manoeuvres of their own. There is the
stolid and stony Waiter, afflicted with chronic stiff neck, who
obeys your behests resentfully and under protest, suggestive of his
being a high-minded Seraph in temporary subjection to a purse-
proud Philistine. There is also the effusively confidential Waiter,
who hovers about you like an affable bluebottle, softly buzzing
ſº advice into your ears, strongly counselling you to refrain
rom the dish of your choice, and pertinaciously urging you to “try
jest a leetle bit of ’’ whatever you have decided to *: Again,
there is that highly obnoxious Waiter—common at public dinners-
who comes round to you towards the end of the repast, and interrupts
the conversation between you and your neighbour, to ask in a
severely tip-suggestive manner, if “there is anythink more as he can
do for you, as he is hoff.” But, perhaps the most unpleasant pecu-
liarities of Waiters come out in connection with the heavy ordeal
known as “Settling.”
Q. Mention some of the salient peculiarities of this process.
A. There being no fixed rule in the matter, you never know whom
you are to pay—the Waiter who has attended you, or some other
solid and superior personage summoned specially for the purpose.
In the former case the Waiter will most probably affect shortness of
memory, and question you closely as to “Wot you've 'ad, Sir,”
correcting you sharply, however, in case of lapse or error on your
part. He will probab { also persist in shouting aloud, the prices of
the several items and the amount of the total, especially if you have
a companion whom you do not wish to be informed on these points.
In the latter case, you are subject to a stern and suspicious cross-
examination, whic . you with a passionate desire to make
lethal use of the water-bottle. Finally, there is the great “tip”-
torture.
Q. What is a “tip” P
A. An undefined quantity of coin of the realm, bestowed, by
voluntary compulsion, upon one Waiter for doing his office badly;
upon another for not doing any office at all, or—as is more commonly
the case—upon both : º in you a sense of being abominably
“done,” and in the Waiter, or Waiters, ingeniously-varied ex-
pressions of dissatisfaction, derision, and disgust.

WANTED.
AND I 'M
FROM A SPANISH SUNNY UN.
-
THE back-yard of the Englishman is the palace of the Sevillian. He retires
from the sun on the lines laid down by his Moorish predecessors, and lives half
the day in a marble court, like the Alhambra Court at the
Crystal Palace. If little footway is dedicated to the public,
that little is scrupulously clean and sweet. The houses
almost kiss each other, and the blue sky above, when it is
turned to fire in the summer, is shut out by awnings drawn
from roof, to roof... The scent of the orange groves is in the
i. * the promised garlick has to be sought after to be
ouncil.
-ºi in . The government of Spain, is, a mixed monarchy, con-
- ...sisting of the King and the Bull-Fighter. In Madrid, the
King #: have a little the best of the bargain; but in Seville the Bull-fighter
is decidedly triumphant. He holds his court in the narrow streets, in the cafés,
and public places. In some of the shops the people bend the knee to him if heis
a. er of his tribe, and all hisinferiors in thering show him this mark of homage.
The Spaniards would be a charming people if they were only a little more
musical. If some one would teach them to play the guitar, or the castanets,
as they are popularly supposed to play them, they would be less disappointing
to the British traveller. Their national air, anthem, or march, is a º:
production. It is the tune the traditional cow died of, and no one can blame
the cow. Their bulls (and horses) die to much more lively music, selected from
the Casinos of Paris.
The economical arrangements of Seville are of what may be called a fatherly
character. Food, as a rule, is sold in the public market, and nowhere else. It
is sold at a very early hour, and at no other time. The prices are fixed by the
Town Council from day to day. The prices are not ºt. The poor and
proud Hidalgo must have a bad time of it. No wonder the proverb says, his
ast-table consists of very little meat and a great deal of table-cloth.
The shops in the narrow streets and alleys are chiefly devoted to the sale
of :*: articles—mostly French and English. The mantillas appear to come
from the neighbourhood of Tottenham Court Road, and to be made of lace that
# * fºr window-curtains. The barbers are as numerous as gin-shops in
gland. They are not Figaros in liveliness, but they know how to shave.
The amusements of Seville (always excepting bull-
fights) are rather melancholy. Spanish dancing appears
to be a fading art. Lopez 5E VEGA wrote four thousand
plays, but they seldom represent them. Mosquitos sting
ou in the houses, and beggars pester you in the streets.
§ ain can compete with Russia in the public exhibition
of curious and wretched cripples.
Having written this much with a quill evidently
drawn from the fretful porcupine, let us do justice to
the brighter side of Seville. "You mix with a people
sober, polite, and orderly. You are in a city of flowers.
There is no smoke in the air, for there is not a fire-place
or a chimney-pot in Seville. Gardens run along the
housetops, and orange-trees grow in the few little publig
squares. Dark-eyed Rosinas peep at you like caged
birds from windows barred with iron-work as delicate as
a spider's web. On every side-in every nook and
corner—are traces of the Moorish past. You turn aside
and find yourself in a garden of palms that is older than
CoLUMBUs, or the continent he discovered. You can
sit by the side of a cool fountain, and dream a dream of
the Arabian Nights.
PRINCEDOM FOR PREFERENCE.
AIR-" The Pope he leads a Happy Life.”
I would not change my mean estate
To reign a Despot e'er so great,
Nor swap this easy chair, to own
The greatest King's or Kaiser's throne.
The life that I should lead in dread
Of daggers, dynamite, and lead,
Not e'en would Royal fare repay,
Though, sure till death, three meals a day.
The Princedom of a people free
Would rather seem the berth for me, -
But such a Prince must bear the weight
Of pomp and ceremony and state.
There’s some foundation-stone to lay,
Some place to open, day by day;
Some public dinner to attend,
And make a speech—of bores no end.
He has to “show" at many a play,
When he’d much sooner keep away.
What trouble princely rank entails |
—I’m glad 1’m not the Prince of WALEs.
The only Prince I’d care to be
Enjoys his Principalitie;
Alone of Princes, all I know, .
I’d be the Prince of MonA-co.
For his domain, so snug and small,
Exertion costs him none at all.
Whilst loyal subjects love the reign
They pay no taxes to maintain.
Since Monte Carlo's Table pays
What revenue he needs to raise.
Your conscientious scruples blow !
Would I were Prince of MonA-co!
Good OMEN.—It is stated that, after this Session, Mr.
Richard Power will retire from the office of Whip to
the Land League Party. Not the first sign by any means
of the Land Leaguers losing power.

THE WAGS OF WATERLOO AGAIN.
IT is not very startling news that last week Ascot Races were held.
Most people knew the date beforehand and made their arrangements
accordingly. Not so the Wags of Waterloo. Late on Monday night
one of them must have seen a newspaper contents bill with the
words “Ascot Races” on it, when possibly the following scene
occurred—
Miterary Wag (bursting into Traffic Manager's room). I say, I
believe Ascot Races come off to-morrow.
Traffic Manager (doubtingly). No, really. (Blows through tube.)
Send for the Sporting Times.
Literary Wag. If it is so, I suppose we ought to do something.
Traffic Manager (sterniy). Leave that to me. Do you know, Sir,
that there is now a train from Shepperton which does the distance,
eighteen miles, in one hour.
Literary Wag. Come! come l you're chaffing.
Traffic Manager. No! fact, upon my j. (Sporting Times
arrives.). By Jovel Ascot Races are to-morrow ! ... (Blows through
tube.) Stop all the regular trains. Make everybody generally un-
comfortable. Blow the season-ticket holders, and above all doub
all the fares.
Literary Wag (going). Wonderful man! What a head for busi-
ness! Wonderfuſ! onderful
his is what we suppose must have occurred, or otherwise we
cannot understand the hopeless bungle of unpunctuality and discom-
fort into which the traffic of the Waterloo Loop Line was reduced
during “Royal Ascot.”
- Taus SPORTING INTELLIGENCE-We were right again! Bruce
won the Grand Prix. What did we say about a Rymillionaire?
Didn't we advise all our readers to put their money on Bruce for the
Prix, and back him heavily F Well, if we didn't, we meant to.
TO SIR WILLIAM THE OPTIMIST.
We may recommend the following slight alteration of an old song
to the serious and immediate attention of the Seldom-at-Home
Secretary:-
“If a Bobby sees a body
Floating high and dry,
Need a Bobby seize that body—
Need a Bobby cry?”
We know that Sir W. W. H. is a firm believer in the perfectibility
of everything, from Convict Prisons and Industrial Schools to Police
efficiency and the Arcadian state of the Metropolis. He can no more
believe in the disgraceful fact that one or two §. die every week
in London of absolute starvation, than he can believe in the dangers
of the Thames Embankment. A Blue-Book just published, which
states that for the last five years nearly two thousand bodies have
been found in the Thames within the Metropolitan District, or an
average of one body a day, and that six hundred and thirteen of
these bodies, or nearly three a week, may be taken to represent
undiscovered murders, is doubtless regarded by the Seldom-at-Home
le|Secretary as a collection of stories that may be told to the Marines.
If some eccentric capitalist would buy the hideous abortion on the
Thames Embankment, which was meant for an Opera-House, and
turn it into a gigantic Morgue for the reception of these bodies,
perhaps the Seldom-at-Home Secretary would then believe his eyes,
or, failing his eyes, the evidence of his other senses?
“KNEE PLUs ULTRA.”—Dr. MUIRHEAD LITTLE has done a big

Business done.—Dead horse of the Kilmainham Compact flogged.
Commons discussing the Prevention of Crime Bill.
Tuesday Night.—The O'Kelly shell, burst to-night quite unex-
pectedly. Mr. FoESTER the slow-match. Been away for a few days
in places where Mr. HEALY ceases from troubling, and Chief Secre-
tary at rest. Came back to-night, looking as ruffled as ever, Mr.
BARRAN, who regards him with despair, says the time when he put
on his own coat, brushed his hair, and wore a collar to fit him,
was exceptional, and not likely to recur. Now ForsTER goes his old
way, puts on the first coat he finds at hand, and only has trowsers of
tolerable fit, because these are garments not usually found lying
about the Cloak-Room at the Club or the House.
Mr. McLAGAN began sniffing round as soon as ForsTER entered;
felt about in his pockets to see if anything smouldering. Nobody
took any notice of that. These Chairmen of Fire Insurance Compa-
nies always suspecting Fire. The O'KELLY sat nearly opposite
FoRSTER, with arms folded, brow lowering, and chest protube-
rant. “Wisibly swelling afore our werry eyes, like the Fat Boy at
his meals,” says Lord EDMUND FITzMAURICE. -
Still, nobody noticed the danger. Slow-match burning steadily.
PARNELL commenced by an attack on the long-suffering ForsTER,
who of course must answer it. ...Then Mr. HopwooD appeared on the
scene, interrupting counsel as if he were Master of the Rolls. PAR-
NELL snapped back at the learned judge, who went on noting the
evidence in dignified silence. When FortsTER rose, Mr. Hopwood
§§ agalil. º Mr. PARNELL his friend; often helped him;
Mr. ForsTER his right hon. friend; full of admiration for his
abilities. But the balance of a judicial mind not to be disturbed
by personal considerations. Having called Mr. PARNELL to order,
the learned judge must really do the same to Mr. FoEstºn. Every-
body, howls upon the learned judge, who reseats himself with grim
§ and prepares to go on with the charge, presently to be
delivered to a rapt jury.
* Slow-match steadily burning all the time. The O'KELLY swells to
Fº size. Never taken his eyes off FoESTER since he entered.
f F. would only tell him why he put him in prison he might simmer
down. Has asked the question. Has indeed put it several times.
FoESTER always declines to answer. Unsatisfied curiosity works
terrible effect in The O'KELLY's mind. Slow-match nearly burnt out
now, FoRSTER on his legs again in style reminiscent of happy days
on the Treasury Bench. The O'KELLY begins to heave.
“Sure there’s a smell of fire somewhere,” says Mr. M'Lagar,
trying to recollect whether the House is insured with the Queen's.
. Poofſ bang ! The O’KELLy’s of Springs to his feet clamorously
indignant for order. “Order” The
O'KELLY's first law. In exemplification
of which axiom, protests he }. “had
enough of these infernal speeches.”
Tremendous excitement. Fragments
of The O'KELLY picked up, heaped
together on a bench. Words to be
taken down, and The O'KELLY to be
taken up. Hubbub for ten minutes.
Then, The O'KELLY, temporarily put
together again, reappears, and, with
subdued mien and wistful look—“like
the fat boy when he found he couldn't
eat any more,” Lord EDMUND says—
proclaims his regret for the untimely
explosion. Everybody shakes hands
with everybody else, and we make-
believe to go to business again.

This Chart requires no explanation.
THINGS THEATRICAL.
MADAME RISTORI is coming to play at Drury Lane (Query, What
sort of game is “playing at Drury Lane?”—ask Mr. HARRIs), in
English. Her one performance in English
years º of Lady Macbeth's sleep-walk-
ing-and-talking Scene, was the finest
thing we ever remember to have seen on
any stage; but then, it only lasted about
twenty minutes.
Of Šiº RossI in Italian, with the
rest of the Company in English, we shall
report next week. A pity that Ristorſ
and RossI couldn't have united their
talents in Macbeth.
SARA. B.-The “ SAL * de spectacle
- had better become a “SAL” d manger.
If her audiences were as thin as herself, Doña SAL would not
be particularly ipleased. A few repetitions of Hernani might do
it; and perhaps a few répétitions might improve it. “Show me his
company, and I'll tell you the sort of man he is”—is proverbial.
Poor SARA –if the standard of her merits were to be her company –
But present company must always be an exception, so we won't say
anything about 'em.
in the 15th, Madame SARAH is announced to play for the Benefit
of the Distressed Jews in Russia, which performance is to be accepted
5. the public as a benefit to M. M. L. MAYER,-this gentleman, as
e advertisement pathetically puts it, “never having taken a
benefit during his management of the French Plays.” Why should he
have had one, unless he has hitherto given his distinguishedservices
as entrepreneur for nothing? Has he lost by the spec.? And have
the theatregoing public, so very much to be thankful to him for P
How do the Gaiety habitués like the rustication of their favourites,
Miles. FARREN, WAUGHAN, Messrs. TERRY, Royce, & Co., during
the London Season? ... He will have deserved a benefit should he
ever succeed in establishing a first-rate French Company in Lon-
don, so as to save us the trouble of crossing over to Paris, to sit
in the mºst uncomfortable theatres in the world, in order to see,
#."; some superior acting. However, on this occasion, the
distressed Jews are to represent their self-effacing and generous
co-tribalist, H. L. MAYER, and the entire proceeds are to be handed
over to the Lord * Baronet ELLIs, the money thus passing from
- ity Christians and Hebrews will come down in
their thousands, and with their hundreds.
French Company.
Once more this week to adapt Shylock to the occasion, our Rich
City Mosaics may well say that “‘Suverins’ is the badge of all our
tribe,”—so may they give pursefuls of 'em to the Mayor-Mayer
Fund on behalf of the Jews who are being served 3 la Russe. .
Lady Monckton, having successfully performed in her own piece,
The Countess, at the Shelley. Theatre—which is such a bijou of a
º: that it might well be called the Nut-Shelley Theatre-is, with
er talented Company, going to repeat the performance next Friday
afternoon at the Prince of Wales's, for the benefit of tho Distressed
Jews. Her Ladyship should have re-named, the play for this occa-
sion, and called it The Discountess. Evidently the Jews' distress is
the Amateurs’ opportunity.
The first Meeting of the Actors' Benevolent Fund Association was
held last Wednesday at the Lyceum, Mr. IRVING in the Chair, and
Mrs. BANCROFT and Miss TERRY in separate boxes. The results
have not yet been published; but we are privately, and º:
Yºy. informed that these are some of * Rules, quite in the
rough :-
RULE No. 1.-When one Benevolent Actor—to be hereafter
referred to in this recital as “B.A.”—meets another Benevolent
Actor, the B.A. who has the more coin in his pocket is to stand a
drink to the less-gifted B.A. at the nearest Club or hostelrie.
RULE No. 2–When several B.A.’s meet together, the most-moneyed
stands treat.
RULE No. 3.--When the amounts in pocket are equal, the highest-
salaried—to be hereafter referred to as “Salario”—stands treat.
RULE No. 4.—Should all the B.A.’s, meeting as hereinbefore men-
tioned, be out of engagement, the B.A. with the best credit shall
have the preference.
Other possible cases were discussed, but without anything definite
being arrived at, except the promise of a hundred a year from
each of the principal London Managers. The most laudable object
of the Association is to abolish the Benefit §º which should
have vanished long ago, simultaneously with Authors'. Nights:
A ſº fuss is made nowadays about “The Stage as a Profession,”
and attempts have been made to get it recognised as on a level with
the Church, the Army and Navy, and the Bar. Clergymen hold
benefices but don't have benefits; our officers, judges, and
barristers don't have benefits; and how any Actor of position
nowadays, when even a fair low-comedian's salary amounts to
over a thousand a year, can go round with the hat—like the street
acrobats, or the drum-and-pandean-pipes-collector for Punch and
Judy, and appeal to public charity without losing his self-respect,
personally º professionally, is a puzzle to all those who have truly
at heart the status of the Theatrical “Profession.” The great
Actor’s “Benefit” is only the small Actor’s “Ticket Night,” writ
large, and the sooner the Actor's Benevolent Fundists can do away
with the Benefit system, the betterfor the social position of the Actor.

Quite what those songs expressed.

Their stars they didn't know.
They sung the songs of ARABI
With very diverse throats;

They hymned the dulcet name from Kew
To Khiva and Herat;
But no one out of Chelsea knew
What ARABI was at.
They sung the songs of ARABI,

That almost seemed a ** faint “Free,”
Was indistinctly heard;
But then it changed to “ Discontent,”

Songs with some words from which would flee

THEY’yE bin so jolly bizzy at the Cristial Pallis lately with the
Lectric ºf...; .# seems to have the singler dubble qualatty of
making epel as cums for to see it, dredful hungry afore they
sees it and dredful thirsty arterwards, that they was obbligated to
send for some of us prinsipple Waiters to help 'em.
... So I've had a pretty ºf dose of Lectricity for the last month or
two, so much so in fack that I shan’t want no more on it for a long
time. If anyboddy wants to know my opinion on it, they can soon have
it; and that is, as I remarked when I fust seed it, it won't do at
no price. In the fast place you can't get away from it. It’s allus
i. i*i. in the face as much as to say, “What are you about
there P I see you!” . The Ladys too don't like it, for it shows up all
the week places, and diskovers all the littel innosense decepshuns that
are thort to be so carefly hidden. So, they woud be with nothink
but gaslights a-shining on 'em. But with this calm kool delikat white
light a-looking at 'em so persistenttly and so quietly, why nothink
can't stand it much above #.º.º. There’s a lot of things
in the world as don't rekwire such a lot of light
For instans now, even in my important perfesshun, there's some
things as is a good deal better by being kep just a little dark. Take
Lobster sauce for instans when Lobsters is scarce. With a flarin
gassy light a-blazing in your eyes, or jest over your head nice j
hot, anythink that’s werry red and werry thick will pass off right
enouff, and even a Allderman will gobble it up without grumbling
but with a Lectric light a-looking at it, so ºft t, and so quiett, and
so troo , why it makes even a seesoned Waiter blush to hand it
round. The same thing arrises with the Beeswing in the werry old
‘’44 Port. What passes for the right artikle with Gas, looks werry
tlike, the wrong 'un with Lectricity. And even with the sacred
Turtel Soup, thorts of Congo Eel will intrude when seen beneeth the
light of this confounded rewealer. Everyboddy can see too wether
the bottle's §§ or not, that the careful Waiter quietly removes
when he thinks the tabel looks just a little too scrowged.
We had the SPEAKER of the House of Commons down last Satterday
week, with a lot of M.P.'s, and Alldermen, and Common Consulmen,
and other scientifick swells. When they all stood up to say grace I
could hardly help shouting out, “The SPEAKER's at prayers!” as I
hears’em allus down at the House. I had the honner of hearing him
speak, which werry few pepel ever has had, altho he is called The
SPEAKER. I don't think much of him as a reel SPEAKER, praps it’s
from want of practis, for he was as quiet, and as calm, and as
genttlemanly as if he’d been sitting at his own tabel, insted of
standing up to speak before such pussonnatches as the LoRD MARE and
Mr. Allderman Fowl:ER., BRow N didn't quite agree with me, for he
said that while all the other gents put him in mind of a fussy gas-
light when it’s turned on too high, and fizzes and fumes without
giving much light, the SPEAKER, with his bewtiful soft yoice and
his quiet clear style, was like the best speciment of Lighting in the
whole Pallis, and that is of course The- -
No, I don't, not for worrlds—of course, I don't mean littorally, but

and we are arainjein with a well-known Member of the Stock
Exchange to form a Kumpny, not to make Lectricity, any fool can
do that that knows how, but to sell our secret to lots of other
Kumpanies, with permission to use it in one of the districks of the
Metrolopus, and as there are about 30 of 'em, why, if we only gits a

well to offer a polite form

be kept perfectly secret.

MUDLORDISM IN LONDON.
THE Duke of Bestminster, ignoring the public convenience, as
becomes one of the four or five great owners of the Metropolis, has
uttered a complaint on behalf of certaintenants about the “vibration
of railway trains.” The great Metropolitan Mudlords can never be
brought to understand that London is not a Cathedral Close, or a
Stagnant Country Conservative town, but a busy hive of four
millions of people, who have to push, rush, sweat, and struggle to
pay rent and taxes, and get a living. The Duke of Bestminster,
owner of the Over-Grown-venor property, may succeed in showing
that the use of the continuous brake on our underground railways
may be productive of a certain amount of annoyance to those
who live over these railways, but are there no other Metropolitan
nuisances which the Duke of Bestminster might use his influence
to diminish? If he would confer with his Grace of Mudford
and other owners of London, he would find º of evils
that want reforming. He would find important streets blocked by
insolent gatekeepers, the right of thoroughfare refused where most
needed, and the rank luxuriance of Mud-Salad Market more rank
and more luxuriant than ever. Whatever complaints may be brought
against the railway companies (and doubtless there are many, for
corporate bodies are far from perfect), these companies have at least
sought for and obtained parliamentary sanction for their work. The
same cannot be said of the great Metropolitan Mudlords, who use
the greatest city in the world as if it were made solely for their profit
and amusement.

“Not a doubt of it,” replied the Provost,
getting up a tree. ... “Boup-lä " What's the
first experiment?” -
Bob produced a pack of cards. The animals
by an instinct seemed to understand All
Fours, and he dealt a hand.
“Hands all Round !” cried the Provost,
getting excited, and in the true Etonian spirit
putting the pot on heavily. His good-humour
was contagious.
A large Boa Constrictor proved a most
agreeable rattle, and finally three cheers were
being given for the party %. convivial
Hip-hip-hippopotamus, when Bob suddenly
threw up his cards.
He had been playing at first with a pro-
fessional Cheetah, and had lost heavily.
Then a Leopard tried it on, but was imme-
diately spotted.
“They have evidently been highl
trained,” cried the Provost, admiringly. “
shouldn't wonder if we weren't near a rail-
way station.”
He thought of going home at last with
honours, }. length in a double first, and he
slid down the trunk.
But at that moment a terrific shout burst
upon their ears. The Hotwhata Cannibals
were upon them again!
Bob boldly faced the scene.
The blue back-ground of the forest was
suddenly relieved by countless figures, every
one of them a staring yeller.
He had an eye for colour. The combina-
tion seemed to fill it with an agreeable green.
The Lion noticed it, and saw his own mane
chance. He gave the signal.
In another instant, with a cheery cry of
“Floreat ''' Bob, determined not to be a

conclusion.
THERE is little left to narrate.
After a series of stirring adventures, in
which the Provost was frequently scalped,
WET Bob, with true Etonian pluck, man-
aged, by constructing an outrigger out of
the bark of some of the wildest dogs, and
getting together a scratch crew of real Cam-
bridge Cannibals, eventually to pull up to
Surley in the very best of spirits.
His marriage with the fair Perkussian,
who had for some time prettily set her cap at
him, came off with much éclat, and, by the
general consent of his schoolfellows, he was
offered the vacant Provostship on his wedding-
dav.
How his yº, old father-in-law, through
his accident with the Hotwhata Canni
forgot who he was, and had to be re-educated,
and once again take his place in the Lower
Remove, and how he passed on to the Upper
Remove, and then, as two Removes are as
bad as a fire, escaped from hisiP.":
position by the aid of a little and a
taller fellow who was a ladder, and how
kindly Bob took him in hand out of school-
hours, soon became well known to the
Governing Body, and afforded them material
for one of their very best after-dinner stories.

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.
ExTRACTED FROM
THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.
IIouse of Lords, Monday Night, June 12.-So many Lords about
to-night, felt sure Land Question must be on again. Turned out to
be merely a family matter. Our deceased wife's brother BILL been
getting into trouble again. Blood is thicker than water, and must
stand by him. Met Prince of WALEs at the back of the Throne
just going in. - - - - - - -
“How do, ToBY P” he said, pinching my ear in a most cordial
way. “My old friend PUNCH

And the Prince, who'd got another pair of new gloves on, went into
the House.
Left his message here and there. Noble Lords who had speeches
ready, winced, but obeyed. Consequence was, only four speeches,
none too long, and Division over by half-past Six.

little irregular, but if we’re going to have the Cl6ture, as well this

triumphantly proved an alibi. Was taking tea on the terrace with a
Lady of Quality.
“One belle at a time is as much as a man can manage,” says JoEY
B., with his dev'lish sly smile.
Tuesday Night.-Conciliation at its height. Land-Leaguers cooing
at the HoME SECRETARY like sucking doves... Mr. HEALY just now
called him a tall bully, and accused him of lifting
his head tº lie. Mr. PARNELL sprung at his throat
when he declined to repeat an argument for the
fifth time, and under a threat of Reporting Pro-
gress insisted on his making a speech.
..Mr. Sexton's failing vigour sufficient to bring
vilest charges º the Irish Constabulary (“Sons
and brothers of Irish farmers,” as Mr. PLUNKET
reminds him); whilst T. P. O'Connor, who has
added the polish of a Chicago drinking-saloon to the

his fist and bawls.

mon thing for a Waiter who gets a day's º to go out and help

thoroughly enjoys himself. Besides, it’s handy in case of emergency.
For instance, somebody about to be expelled; SPEAKER, leaves the

Chair with surprised look, as if saying to himself, “Dear me, who
can it be now P Is it Mr. HEALY, or is it Mr. NEwdEGATE P”
Business done.—Crime Bill. Passed Clauses 5 and 6.
Wednesday Afternoon.-Pretty to see W. E. G. and J. LowTHER
conversing across the table. An air of gracious deference about the
younger man, and a keen interest
in what he says on the part of the
older one, that makes the interlude
quite delightful. JAMEs is a little
inaccurate as to facts, but that
makes matters the more exciting.
“You may do anything with
WEG,” says Mr. CHAPLIN ; ** all
things but two. You mustn't men-
tion Kilmainham, and you mustn't
misquote his speeches.”
A little hard on the House this
latter stipulation. W. E. G., the
only living man that can remember
what Mr. GLADSTONE has said
during the last five years. JAMES
certainly cannot ; thinks he gets
near enºugh when he quotes, on
W. E. G.'s authority, the desire
that Turkish officials should go,
“bag and baggage, over the Bos-
phorus.”
“Never said a word about the
Bosphorus !” cries the PREMIER,
*ś across the table.
“Well,” says JAMEs, with a de-
ferential smile, “I was always
under the impression that the Bos-
phorus separated Europe from
W. E. G. discovering that the Sul-
tan is his long-lost Brother.
N.B.-Observe the “attitude of the
Porte.”
Asia; but of course I accept the statement of the Right Hon.
Gentleman.”
Nothing more pleasing to the well-regulated mind than this. It
was not for a comparative youth like JAMEs to argue with a veteran
statesman. At school JAMEs had been taught that the Bosphorus
separated Europe from Asia. The experience of -
later years confirmed the view. But, of course, -
if Mr. GLADSTONE said not, the matter was settled.
The fact that Mr. GLADSTONE had said nothing
about the Bosphorus, and had not had it in his
mind, could not defeat the º: purpose of JAMEs.
He would be humble and defer to his elders.
Perish the Bosphorus rather than that JAMEs
LowTHER should appear for an instant to hold
his own views against those of Mr. GLADSTONE.
A very pretty scene, and all the more amusing
to the circle of JAMEs's political friends by seeing
how angry it made “old GLADSTONE.”
Business done. —Wrangled till Four o’Clock.
Made-believe Debate on Crime Bill till Six. Work
actually done, None.
Friday Morning.—Over a hundred questions
last night, thirty addressed to DILKE. Didn't
make much out of him. To twenty-five out of
the thirty only one answer: Could not say any-
thing about Egypt in present circumstanges.

The SECRETARY of STATE for WAR declined to state whether the

Crimean War had been delivered to Members.
The FIRST LoBD of the ADMIRALTY said it was utterly impossible

pliment to his collaborateur. The
eminent French littérateur, M.
GUILLAUME PARKE, with his Eng-
lish colleague, Mr. PAULTon—Eh?
PARKE not French either P Then
why call the piece by a French name?
Isn't this Tower of Babel business
being somewhat overdone? Man-
teaua. Noirs, then, by two English
writers, who lost their French Dic-
tionary just at the critical moment
when they wanted to translate some-
body's suggestion for a title, is a free
—avery free-adaptation of Scribe's
Giralda, and has found its way to
the stage without meeting with the
obstructions in the Lord Chamber-
lain's office which might have been
expected by those who did not know
the eccentricity that marks the
Licenser's proceedings. “How does
he do it,” the Licenser? The general impression is that he tosses up
whether the piece, shall, pass or not. Heads—yes, certainly, why
not Tails—couldn't think of it for a moment! And, having
recently become possessed of Mr. Cor's shilling with two heads, the
Nibelungen, Odette, and Manteauz Moirs are the consequences.
How some of the lines in the Manteaua, Noirs could have escaped
the Licenser's eye, not on account of their length or brilliancy, but
of their breadth, is a
puzzle to the audience,
which hardly knows how
to receive them. Fuss
about School of Dramatic
Art! Snivel about the non-
recognition of the Stage
as a Profession As long
as Actors and Actresses
can allow anything coarse
which may have escape
the Licenser, to pass
muster at dailyrehearsals
they must not esurprised
if their social status con-
tinues to be equivocal. The Authors of the libretto should never
have written the objectionable matter. Let the Excise-man come
down, and excise the lines, which will then represent the out-lines
of the piece.
Some of the jokes in the dialogue go capitally; and this is the
more surprising, because they have been going so long that they
must be getting tired. It’s wonderful what stamina a good joke
has. Besides, there's nothing like being cautious. A new witticism
may miss fire; but it is a cruel audience that will not greet an old, old
friend with a smile of welcome.
And the music is singularly
º: to the dialogue.
‘That’s a pretty tenor song
in The Mascotte. Yes, we'll
have that,” one can imagine
Signor BUCALossI saying to
himself. (“Book-a-loss-I,”

So he composes it over
again, and so on throughout
the score.
It's the acting that does it.

reputation of his theatre. It is not a good part for him, but he
bustles briskly enough through the part, and his share of the dia-
logue is nicely balanced between the English and French versions—
a little compliment to both sides.
Mr. LESLIE should Fº in a touch of neutral tint here and there, and
then the picture of the ancient Prime Minister would be well done.
On the whole, Manteaua. Noirs is not so black as it is painted in
its advertisements, but is a light Opera with comic situations. But
as to the music, its greatest recommendationis, that it is not like the
measles, because there is nothing catching about it.
Signor Ross's experiment at Her Majesty's was a mistake. The
house, on the first night, was very poor—as poor as the performance.
No play, one of the immortal Bard's least of all, can stand against
indifferent representation, and any chance º unaware of the
fact that he was witnessing a work of the Divine WILLIAMs, would
have condemned the play itself as undramatic in action, uninterest-
ing in plot, and tedious in dialogue. And, had the above-mentioned
chance * been told by a highly
cultivated and generally idealistic per- sº-
sonage that he was lacking in appreciation - - -
of the Poetic Drama, the chance spectator
would probably have replied, that if this
was the Poetic Drama in action, he cer-
tainly utterly failed to appreciate it, and
rather congratulated himself on the fact
of not having made for himself a false
artistic conscience.
In vain Mr. Lyons delivered the Fool's
speeches with every variety of point and
meaning, but the audience received them
stolidly, a non-poetic personage remark-
ing that “if the Actor were correctly
representing the Author's creation, what
al }. fool SHAKSPEARE must have ---
intended that Fol of Lear's to be tº "ºº".
Some one who had seen the piece years ago, one in Il vºll.
when Miss KATE TERRY played the Fool—if we may be allowed the
Shakspearian expression—at the Princess's, informed us that the
Fool's was “a pathetic part.” Why? The º Fool was a profes-
sional Jester, hired by the year, and paid to be y. If he wasn’t
funny, he was dismissed without a character, and wouldn't get
another place in a hurry. Who, in search of a Fool, would take one
who had been turned away from his last place for being “pathetic”?
But in discussing one Fool, we have passed over the §: Fool
who employed him, King Lear. Signor Rossi spoke Italian, and
everybody else spoke English—or what is supposed to represent our
language on the Stage. The effect
was decidedly bad. Mr. RYDER,
as Kent—he had far better have
been in Kent than Middlesex this
evening—seemed to be waiting,
with an air of suppressed irrita-
bility, for his time to speak-
“when my cue comes, call me”-
and when Signor RossI gave him a
chance, after cruelly deceiving him
by several false pauses, Mr. RYDER,
with that eloquently crooked fore-
finger of his magisterial right
hand, appeared to be severely cor-
recting a feeble old gentleman who
would insist on , talking Italian
when everybody else was speaking
English. For example:- - - --
Signor Lear (with plenty { gesticulation). Tumiseryirai! Sedgpo
il pranzo non ti amomeno, d'ora— (Mr. RYDER, thinking he has
finished, is about to speak, when Signor Rossi, noticing his intention,
forestalls him, and resumes, hurriedly)—d'ora, non-mi dividerö da
te. (Pause. Mr. RyDER and the other Actors on the Scene regard
one another curiously, as much as to say, “Is it, our ºn nºw, or

PUNCH, OR THE LONDON CHARIVARI.
Senior Ryder (after ascertaining, by a judicious pause, that Signor
RossI has quite done, begins in the vered and irritated manner of a
long-suffering man who has been unjustly “put upon,” and who has
at last an opportunity of airing his grievance.) My Lord, I know not
what the matter is—(sniff)—but to MY judgment—(strong emphasis
on “my”)--your Highness is not entertained—(sniff—with probably
an aside to himself, “And nobody else is entertained by your Slow-
mess”)—with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. (Pause.
RossI wants to cut in now, but Mr. RYDER holds him with his crooked
jorefinger and his glittering eye—like An Ancient Mariner with a
long yarn to spin. {{. RYDER has his chance at last, and he makes
the most of it. He continues, with emphasis and discretion.)
There’s a great abatement—(Aside to himself, “There will be at the
box-office before this series is finished ”) – of kindness appears,
&c. &c., &c.
And so on. It took time, and was not jº.
good twice; once in pantomimic action, when he knelt to Cordelia:
this was admirable, and everybody woke up, and gave him a round
of genuine applause. And once again, when, in º to Gloster, he
answers, “Ay, every inch a king ſ”. This brought down the house,
which, however, never rose again afterwards, except to leave.
The first performance of WEBER's Euryanthe was warmly greeted
by a crowded audience at Drury Lane, last Tuesday. There were
many elderly gentlemen present, who, when they heard the familiar
chorus, “Songs sweetly Sounding,” felt the tears start to their eyes,
as they called to mind the happy nights at Evans's with the pale
#. man at the piano in one corner of the platform, the youthful
usician at the harmonium in the other corner, while ranged behind
the brass rail stood the sallow, bleary-
eyed, up-all-night boy-choristers,
backed by a line of bass, baritone,
and tenor singers, from the age of
twenty-one to fifty ; , when the
accompaniment of the above-named
instruments mingled with, and was
occasionally overpowered by, the
jingling of glasses, the clattering of
ves and forks, the voices giving
crders while the waiters were in the
room (and they were never out of it),
the popping of soda-water, the pay-
ing of money, and the buzz of con-
versation, , silenced from time to
time by the Chairman's hammer;
and when, amid the incense of the
steaming potatoe, the fragrant per-
fume of the chop, steak, or kidney,
and the mixed aroma of the tobacco
of all sorts and of all nations, there
arose the weary boys' clear young
voices, and above them all came Euryanthe's solo, with its roulades
and cadenza, to be followed by the hearty applause of a hundred hands,
rapping of sticks on the floor, and of knife-handles on the table, and
was gas and gladness as the clock, struck twelve, and the boys
bowed and retired, to give place to their elders, including the Comic
Vocalist, the Sentimental Singer, and the inimitable improvvisatore.
This, to some of us, was one charm of Euryanthe, the other night.
Oh, Green Days of our Youth ! 0, Evans !—but no matter.
The plot of Euryanthe is dull and stupid. The anti-climax of the
finale of the First Act damped the enthusiasm. Frau R. SuchER
is good, and the Chorus was excellent–except in their acting-
though this was pardonable, as no living Chorus, with, any self-
respect, could make itself, collectively, such a set of idiots as the
fibrettist has made it. The Chorus never knows its own mind nor
anybody else's: one minute it is all for the heroine, then all against
her, then º: then “all for her” again, then “all for him,”—in
fact, there's no knowing where to have this Chorus-except of
course in this Opera, where they are, and can’t be got rid of. The
idiotic story turns on a ring hidden in the tomb of the hero's
sister, named Emma, who has committed suicide. The appropriate
title would be, “Euryanthe; or, Woe Emma / " However, the
%. is well worth hearing, for the music alone; though, on the
whole, we should prefer the music alone, or, still better, selections.
But the ...}. success of the German Opera Season is Die
Meister singer von Nüremberg, by RICHARD WAGNER. Here
RICHARD is himself again, which he is not in the Nibelung's Ring,
where he loses himself in the dusk of the Gods, goes to the depths of
Paganism for an objectionable plot, and shows a group of characters
actuated, dramatically, .# the lowest motives, and, musically, by all
sorts of mixed motives, of which some are good, some bad, aná many
indifferent... But Die Meistersinger, or—as the second, title might
be—A Cobbler there was, &c.—(the stalls were all filled in compli-
ment to the Cobbler)—is charming throughout. . A simple and suffi-
ciently, interesting story, illustrated by thoughtful, mirthful, and
delightful melody, which is never wearisome from first to last—and it
is a long Opera. There are in it several complete choruses, a

chorale, two or three distinct songs with real live tunes to them, and
a finished quintette which would have been vociferously encored
had Herr RICHTER permitted it. The stage-management is weak.
The acting is excellent, especially the part of Sachs by Herr GURA.
The genuine comic acting of Herr EHRKEwas excellent, and Fräulein
MALTEN looked and sang ...; No one fond of melodious Opera,
and no unbeliever in WAGNER, should miss seeing his Meistersinger.
After the first performance of Romany Rye, at the #.

had “run away.” We present him with this consolatory distich :

I'M ENGAGED To go
A HANDBOOK OF KNOWLEDGE.
No. W.-DRIVERS.
Q. WHAT is a Driver ? A. The ruthless and irresponsible autocrat of London roadways.
Q. What is the function of a Driver ? - - -
A: To drive-in, the widest sense of that term. That is to say, that whilst his busi.
ness is to drive vehicles of one sort, or another from, place to place, his pleasure is to
drive horses to death, pedestrians off the roadway, timid old ladies to distraction, and annual
multitudes to the hospital and the cemetery. - - -
Does the effectual execution of his proper duties incidentally involve these scarcely
desirable results? A. Not at all.
Q. Why, then, does the Driver indulge in them? - -
A. To gratify his own propensities, which are as strongly, marked as peculiar, and all in
the direction of cruelty to animals and annoyance and injury to the pedestrian public.
Q. Once seated on #. box or perch, what is the first impulse of the Driver?
A. To make as much noise as possible.
Q. What, from the Driver's point of view, are the advantages of this proceeding P
A. in addition to the general annoyance which the noise causes to the public at large,
it irritates, the animals he is driving, and deafens and disconcerts the passing wayfarer,
thus materially increasing the facilities for disturbance, and the chances of accident.
Q. Should the Driver perceive anyone in the act of crossing the road, or about to do so,
what is his course of action? - - -
4. To crack his whip as loudly as possible, and howl stentorian, though inarticulate,
anathemas at the person in question.
Q. With what effect upon the latter?
4. Of confusing, if not frightening, him, and either driving the would-be crosser back
to the pavement, sending him splashing through the mud with needless haste, or—quite
probably—depositing him in the gutter.
Q. Could not these inconveniences be avoided ?. A. In the majority of cases quite easily.
Q: Why, then, are they not ?. A. Because their avoidance would involve the exercise of
precisely those qualifications in which Drivers, as a class, are most signally deficient.
Q. What are these ? A. Ordinary civi-
lity and reasonable carefulness.
Q. What do you consider to be the most
conspicuous and universal characteristic of
Drivers ?
4. Wanton and malignant incivility.
Q. How do you account for this P
A. It cannot be accounted for. It is
indeed supposed that the power of annoy-
ance and immunity from check or chas-
tisement afforded by their “bad eminence”
on Hansom or Pickford, encourage the
growth in them, as in other Autocrats, of
cynical malice and chuckling brutality.
Q. How are these manifested ?
A. In every imaginable way, and in
many ways not imaginable—by anybody
but a Driver. The following are a few—a
very few—examples. The Driver of a
ponderous waggon delights, in plunging
along as furiously and noisily as possible,
especially if the road be narrow or crowded,
if there be women and children about, or
if he have reason to suspect the vicinity of
sick people. The driver of any vehicle,
from a van to a hansom, will steer care-
fully out of his direct course, if, by so
doing, he can alarm a nervous old lady,
painfully agitate a limping old gentleman,
or cause º: crossing the road needlessly
to quicken his page. Drivers delight in wet
weather, as affording them the opportunity
—never neglected—of deliberatelysplashin
mud over the garments of well-dre
people. They also largely : flicking
with their, whips restive e-horses,
weary cattle, passing dogs, inoffensive boys,
or indeed grown-up persons, whom, from
their mild bearing, unprotected condition,
(and the remoteness of a policeman), they
may deem as safe as it is delightful to
annoy. The gratuitous, ill-conditioned,
ingrained malice of the Driver is, however
in nothing more conspicuously manifested
than in the manoeuvres of a Cabman who
chances to be approaching just as you are
about to cross a street.
Q. How so?
.A. If you hasten your pace to get before
him, he does the same—to prevent your
doing so. If, on the other hand, you pause
to let him pass, he slackens his pace imme-
diately—to º you waiting as long as
ossible. This little comedy of spite may
witnessed at any street-corner in London
twenty times a day.

REMARKABLE ROMANCES.
(By a Rambler.)
No. WI.--THE Two WATCHES.
THERE was once an industrious watchmaker, who was always
busy from morning till night, with a magnifying glass screwed into
his right eye. One Summer he especially
devoted his energies to the perfecting
of two watches, which he intended to
be more than equal to the best produc-
tions of London, Geneva, or Waltham.
The worthy Horologist, moreover, took
extra pains, because both watches were
º the One by the Squire's Son,
a devil-may-care sort of fellow, who
lived every day of his life, and took
credit with Time for a great many
more; while the Other was destined
for the fob of the village Curate, a
timid, retiring young man, who devoted
his existence to severe books and bene-
volence of the unobtrusive kind. But
- while the young Squire's watch was to
be cased with gold, that of the Parson was to be clad in the more
humble silver. Both were finished one Midsummer Eve, and the good
maker was just surveying the result of his labours with reasonable
priº, when there game in unto him his little Grand-daughter.
"Gran'pa,” she lisped, “ToMMy says this is the night when the
Fairies come out—Is it true?”
“True!” cried the Grandfather. “Of course not. Why, Tortre
there are no such things as Fairies. Fairies indeed!” and he laughed
heartily as he put away his tools.
Now it so happened that these contemptuous remarks were over-
heard by a little Gentleman, who at that very minute was resting in
the Chimney, wondering what new frolics he could be up to... When
I tell you that his name was Robin GooDFELLow, I need not describe
him further.
“Ho! ho! Master Watchmaker. No Fairies, indeed! We shall
see; we shall see!” and he chuckled so loudly to himself that the
old man said, “There’s that blessed Cat in the chimney again.
Hsh Hsh Hsh l’”
. When the family had gone to bed, RoRIN softly descended and
inspected the premises. He was especially taken with the two new
watches, and was at first inclined to break the glasses and springs of
both, but a more ingenious idea suggested itself to him. Tak #
two tiny boxes from his pocket, he anointed the Gold Watch wi
salve labelled “Slow,” and the Silver one with ointment marked
“Fast.” . Then, having executed a JoHN D'AUBAN hornpipe on the
Cuckoo clock, which feat nearly frightened the bird's voice out of it,
he fled through the key-hole back to Fairyland.
Next morning the Gold Watch was despatched to the Squire's Son,
and the Silver to the Curate. When the former received his new
timekeeper, he was just about to consume a bottle of champagne
Hº. to starting in his dog-cart for the races; but scarcely h
e fastened it to his chain, than a change came over him. He called
for some §. substituted his evening trowsers for a pair of
large checked breeches and gaiters, and, much to the astonishment
of his relatives and retainers, spent the day in the #; reading
Tupper's Philosophy, and Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. He
was not more lively on hearing that the Right Honourable Bash;
INGTON BINKs, the great Radical M.P.s was coming to dine and
sleep, and would certainly be furnished with a stock of new and
racy anecdotes.
The effect of the Silver Watch on the Curate was precisely :*:
After he had adjusted it to his horsehair-guard, he chucked his
landlady under the chin, kissed the parlour-maid, and sent round to
the “Griffin” for a tandem to take him to the race-course. The

parishioners were presently both surprised and shocked to see him
tooling through the village with a long cigar in his mouth, a white
hat on his head, and a moss rosebud in his button-hole. And the
tºº. furthermore subsequently deposed that he distinctly
heard him say, “Dem the changel” Indeed, the villagers could
scarcely credit their eyeballs or the drums of their ears. ...At the
races the Curate plunged boldly into the mysteries of betting, of
which he learnt nothing, beyond the fact that he ºl. a score of
oblong tickets of curious hue; he also encouraged Negro Minstrels
and Gipsy. Soothsayers, and freely consumed intoxicants in the
company of Bookmakers and Backers. So it came to pass that just
before the last race he had reduced his pocket-money to a Godless
florin and a sixpence with a hole through it. Yet a burning desire
to wager filled his breast. As he was debating within himself what
to do, Mr. BALLs, the Member for Flamborough, passed by.
BALLs was an ex-Pawnbroker, an Ultra-Tory, and being in favour of
unlimited traffic in strong drinks, and of strong-minded, fox-hunting
Clergymen, had heretofore been utterly repugnant to the Curate's
soul. But now he addressed him with boldness and familiarity,
“ BALLs, old boy,” he cried, “lend us a fiver?”
The M.P. was much startled at this laconic speech, but speedily
recovered his affability.
“Oh, oh!” he chuckled, “Parsons going racing—quite in the
good old style. What next? A fiver, is it you want, young man?
What security?” he asked, from old force of habit.
The Curate felt in his pockets.
“I 've nothing,” he said, “except this watch. It’s silver, but a
er.
“All right ! that’ll do!” said BALLs. “Hand it over; here's
the money.” But scarcely had the exchange been effected, when
the Legislator exclaimed, “I’m quite ashamed to see one of your
cloth, at a race-meeting. The Church must be disestablished. By
Gad it’s time, when such things occur. I shall certainly bring it
before...the 'Ouse—before the 'Ouse of Commons, Sir. Remember
§: ” and he strode away, leaving the poor Curate overcome with
anae.
Here he was, away from his parish, clad in unseemly raiment,
reeking of tobacco, filled with wine, and wearing, in place of his
Mr. watch? Mine has gone to
supple wideawake, a white hat, surrounded by red-cheeked, un-
clothed dolls. Dashing the obnoxious head-covering to the ground,
he fled towards his lodgings, weeping bitter tears, and moaning
aloud for his transgressions. His conduct was charitably ascribed
to mental aberration...but it, cost him many months' penance to
make peace with his Vicar and his Bishop. Even when, many years
after, he became Rural Dean, he would shudder at the very name of
Epsom or Ascot.
eantime, Mr. BASHINGTON BINKs had arrived at the Squire's,
and in his merriest vein, but his eldest Son heard his anecdotes with
gloomy indifference, and sanctimoniously sighed at his broad conver-
sation.
“Bluepill's the best cure for the blues,” said Mr. BINKs, jocularly,
as he retired to rest. “By the way, Could somebody lend me a
Q be repaired. I have to get up early to
study the Anti-Potato Agitation Question.”
The young Squire proffered his.
“You had better keep it till you get your own back,” he added,
feeling filled with will towards his fellow-creatures.
“Ay, that I will,” said Mr. BINKs, and went to bed... As the
watch went up the stairs, the Squire's Son became himself again,
He rushed into the billiard-room, called for brandy-and-soda, played
a certain Captain HAWBUCK all night at “shell out,” and was carried
to º: chamber by the Stablemen in the early dawn, as was his usual
custom.
On the following day, or rather night, the House of Commons was
electrified by two speeches on the Unlimited Potato Bill. Mr. BALLs,
hitherto its bitterest opponent, because a scorching hot Free Trader,
while the Radical, BASHINGTON BINKs, a prominent Member of the
Governmemt, actually delivered, an oration worthy of the most
primeval Protectionist. The excitement in political circles was im:
mense. The Reform called a general meeting of its Members, and
the Carlton passed a resolution making its organisation more strictly
of a #. nature. Three leader-writers on daily journals became
drivelling idiots, the Fourth Party issued a manifesto which no one
understood, and the Bank Rate rose with the Sun. -
That samemorning, as Mr.BALLs was walking home, he was relieved
of the Silver Watch in Parliament Street, when he instantly became

unpleasantly conscious that he had most likely ruined his political
future. After a bucketful of black coffee, he spent the next six hours
writing explanatory letters of a feeble and vague nature to news-
paper Editors. But these did not save him from the thong of his
irate. Whip. Meanwhile, the Pickpocket, who had feloniously
º: the watch, immediately imagined himself to be a Burglar,
and was promptly taken up by a Detective for housebreaking, while,
shortly afterwards, the Detective, thinking himself the Director of
Criminal Investigation, was put under arrest for insulting a Sergeant.
Concurrently, Mr. BASHINGTON BINKs, having received back his
own chronometer, Fº up the Gold Watch in a cardboard box,
and directed it to the Squire's Son. Being of an economical turn of
mind, and on bad terms with the Postmaster-General, he did not
register the parcel. His speech in the House somewhat nettled him,
but he felt that he had no need to take it seriously to heart, for being
a Cabinet Minister, he had become accustomed to eating his own
words. The watch was, in course of transmission, stolen by a dis-
honest Postman, who forthwith imagined himself to be a Pillar-box,
delivered no letters, and stood at the corners of streets with his
mouth open. Here he was found by his sister, who was a Ballet-
º at a spectacular Theatre. She, imagining him to be overcome
ygin, and foreseeing disastrous consequences, emptied his pockets,
and took the watch with her to the playhouse. That night her
wonted light trip was changed to that of a Tragedian-like stride,
and, at the close of the performance, she was abruptly dismissed by
the Stage Manager for marring his grandest choreographic effect.
The Silver Watch had now, F. : the trial of the Pickpocket,
and the investigation of the Detective's conduct, passed into the
hands of a hardworking Police-clerk, who promptly took upon him-
self, the airs of a young man-about-town, put a toothpick between
his lips, bought a Stall at a West-End theatre, and afterwards hung
about the stage-door just as the unfortunate Ballet-girl came out
sobbing and crying at the loss of her situation. The Police-clerk,
who was naturally kindhearted, had now become remarkably forward,
as befitting his new capacity, and hastened to inquire into the cause
of her woe, with the most gallant air imaginable. The maiden was
anxious for sympathy, and too stricken with grief not to listen to the
ºf voice of the cavalier. Knowing, too, the consolation of food,
she further accepted an invitation to supper at a French restaurant.
After the repast, the Clerk, forgetting the little difference between
meum, tuum, and suum, begged the lady's acceptance of the Silver
Watch. With some reluctance she consented to take the gift, but,
presto 'scarcely had she done so, when, the influence of the One
neutralised the effect of the Other. Rising up, with virtuous in-
dignation starting from every pore, she soundly boxed the wretched
Clerk's ears, and started to walk to her home in Lambeth, over West-
minster Bridge. Half-way across, she remembered the watches.
“Perhaps JIM,” (her brother) “who is rather light-fingered, stole
it !” she thought, in a fright, and took the Gold Watch from her
pocket. ...“ I’ve no doubt the other man is as bad. I’ll get rid
of both.”
Acting under the impulse, and not without a sigh of regret at the
extravagance, she first threw the Silver Watch into the Thames.
As it touched the water, the stream raced along so fast as to well-
nigh carry away the tugs anchored in the tide, and to seriousl
endanger the piles of Waterloo Bridge; and, indeed, the Southwar
householders seriously thought that an inundation was upon them;
but when the Gold Watch joined its companion, the river resume
its wonted appearance. The Ballet-girl passed on her way, lighter
in pocket, and, strange to say, in heart. I have since heard that
she is married to a pork-butcher. Merit is never unrewarded,
sooner or later.
In the interests of civilisation, I implore no one to dredge in the
hope of recovering the Watches. See how they have corrupted
humanity already | Be warned by the Curate, the Squire's Son, the
two M.P.'s, the Postman, the Pickpocket, the betective, the Police-
Clerk, and the Ballet-girl; and, above all, remember that this story
is strictly true. It cannot be otherwise, for I wrote it.
MRs. RAMsboTHAM says the drawing-room of her dear, friend,
Lady CoRRYMongstER, is now so crowded with pick-a-back that it is
more like a Mausoleum than anything else.

NIGHT : *
Sweet One. “YEs, SIR.

MoTHER KEPT on PINching ME, 'cAUSE I was so
WERY FISHY LEGISLATION.
HIP, Hip, Hooray! Three Chairs for the Copperation, and three Chairs for
the House of Lords! Didn't I say as the Copperation could depend on 'em P
Why in course they could. They acts on the same principals, and when they
has to decide atween a sacred CHARTER for the rich and a lot of most common
Fish for the Poor of the Low East End of London, who could dowbt the result?
Why BRowN tells me there was a reel live Dook in the Chair, and 2 Erls and 2
Barrens, and wen our sacred Charter was brot in by the Copperation Charter
Keeper and handed to the Dook, there was quite a hawderbel buzz of admera-
shun, and no wunder as it was more than 500 long ears old, and all written in
such old Lattin as even the Dook couldn't read it tho' he is a Irishman.
So then both the Erls tried, but it wasn't no go, and then the 2 Barrens
tried, both together, but they were as barren as the Erls and couldn't make
nothink of it, and so they was obligated to ask the poor Charter Keeper to read
it, tho' they was such Noble Swells, and he blushing all the wile like a grate
school gal, red it all off without wunce taking his breth.
Qf course that settled the whole matter, and if the poor low peeple at the East
End wants more fish they must go more than 7 miles to get it, and then they
won't be a flying in the face of the uncommon sense of the Sacred Charter of
EDDARD the 3d.
And now let me call speshalatention to the kind and generous and nobelmanl
way in which, the Dook, and the Erls and the Barrens and the grand .#
Copperation, all combined together to let the Poor down easy. They acshally
passed the Bill! and then they jest added two little clawses. One was, that if
the Copperation should think as how the little Shadwel Market was a going
to pay, that they should have the right to buy it up at cost price, so as to git
all the profit and let a lot of common people run all the risk. Wasn't that jest
a clever dodge? BRown º he thinks it’s quite worthy of 'em all, and even of
Sir Edward DoDGER himself, but then BRown will exadgerate so. But I thinks
as the other claws is the cleverest of the 2, and beats amost anythink exce
old Port and dry Shampain. It is sojolly elever that I'm afeard nobody .
beleeve me when I says it, but it’s religiously true.
They at geshally ordered that every pound of the commonest fish as goes into
poor little Shadwell Market to feed the werry commonest kind of people, shall
pay the werry same toll as the werry finest Sammon as
gos into lovely Billingsgate to feed such emmenent swells
as Dooks and Common Counselmen; so that any de-
fishansy as happens at Billingsgate, cos peeple prefers
goin to a New Market º because it happens to be
big and clean and comfortabel, shall be made up from
Shadwell, so as that the Grand old Copperation shan’t
lose a copper by the alteration.
I calls that somethink subblime ! Screwing out tup-
ence or thrippence from the costermongers to pay for
urtel and Chºi. and serve 'em rite. What rites
had they to go and give such evidense about poor dear
Billingsgate being so filthy, and so scrowged, and so
little, that they was all a-scrambling over one another,
when a most respectabel Salesman, who doesn't make a
much better income than the Prime Minister, acshally
says that it's a beautiful Market, and plenty big enuff
for him, and another gent who’s got a nice bit of prop-
perty in the mayberhood says all it wants is a better
aproach jewdishuslie made 1
Ah, I never knowed 'till last week what sly fellers
some of the werry highest of our Harrystockracy is, and
how werry dearly they does love a good practikle joke.
I see there’s a talk of asking the House of Common
Counselmen to upset the hole derangement, but who
cares for the Commons when the bluming Lords shines

LAYS OF A LAZY MINSTREL.
HAMBLEDON LOCK.
A CAPITAL luncheon I’ve had at the “Lion,”
I’ve drifted down here with the light Summer breeze;
Iland at the bank, where the turf's brown and dry on,
And lazily list to the music of trees |
Oh, sweet is the air, with a perfume of clover,
Oh, sleepy the cattle in Remenham meads!
The lull of the lasher is soothing, moreover,
The wind whistles low in the stream-stricken reeds!
With sail closely furled, and a weed incandescent—
Made fast to a post is the swift Shuttlecock—
I think you will own 'tis uncommonly pleasant
To dream and do nothing by Hambledon Lock!
Now a barge blunders through, overbearing and shabby,
With its captain asleep, and his wife in command;
Then a boatful of beauties for Medmenham Abbey,
And a cargo of campers all tired and tanned. -
Two duffers collide, they don't know what they're doing–
They’re both in the ways of the water unskilled—
But here is the Infant, so great at canoeing, .
Sweet, saucy, short-skirted, and snowily frilled.
I notice the tint of a ribbon or feather,
The ripple of ruffle, the fashion of frock;
I languidly laze in the sweet Summer weather,
And muse o'er the maidens by Hambledon Lock!
What value they give to the bright panorama—
Oh, had I the pencil of MILLAIs or SANDys!—
The lasses with sunshades from far Yokohama,
The pretty girl-scullers with pretty brown hands!
Next the Syren steams in ; see the kind-eyed old colley,
On the deck, in the sun, how he loves to recline !
Note the well-ordered craft and its Skipper sojolly,
With friends, down to Marlow, he's taking to dine.
In the snug-curtained cabin, I can't help espying
A dew-clouded tankard of seltzer-and-hock,
And a plateful of peaches big babies are trying,
I note, as they glide out of Hambledon Lock!
A punt passes in, with Waltonians laden,
And boatman rugose of mahogany hue.; -
And then comes a youth and a sunny-haired maiden
Who sit vis-à-vis in their basswood canoe.
Now look at the Admiral steering the Fairy,
Oh, where could he find a much better crew than
His dutiful daughters, FLO, NINA, and MARY,
o row with such grace in his trim-built randan?
I muse while the water is ebbing and flowing,
I silently smoke and serenely take stock -
Of countless Thames toilers, now coming now going,
Who take a pink ticket at Hambledon Lock!

PUNCH AMONG THE PROPHETS.
CANON BASIL WILBERFoRCE is Bishop-Elect of Newcastle. No doubt
he has already received many congratulatory addresses; but, years
ago, Mr. Punch was the first to admonish Canon BASIL, in a tone of
prophetic warning, as to the duties of the elevated position which he
was one day destined to occupy. Mr. Punch foresaw it, though the
young Don BASILIo did not; for in his reply to Letter XXXI. in
Punch's Complete Letter-Writer (Vol. VII., p. 169, 1844), BASILIQ
intimated his intention of renouncing the idea of taking Orders, and
of going to the Bar instead; because, as he observes in his P.S., “They
tell meſ’ve the gift of the gab’’—a talent which he has Wilberforcedly
cultivated, as may be gathered from the paragraph in Truth, where
welearn that the Elect Bishop BASIL has been preaching to “over-
flowing congregations.”
“My dear BASIL,” wrote Mr. Punch, in the immortal series
already alluded to, “I have endeavoured to place before you your
duties as the Parish Pastor of a flock. Providence may, however,
raise you to the bench. Yes, BASIL; you may become a Bishop.
Nevertheless, seek not the dignity; nay, pray that it may never fall
upon you. In your mid-day walks, in your closet, in your bed, let
your constant ejaculation be—Nolo Episcopal. Sweet, most sweet,
is the humblest curacy—dangerous and difficult the richest see.
How far happier—how more truly primitive—the Pastor of a Welsh
mountain, than the Bishop of even golden Durham I?’
And now, Mr. Punch, strongly recommending the elect Bishop
BASIL to read the above-mentioned letter from º to end, to
retire within himself, and ponder its contents, folds him to his heart
in his paternal embrace, bestows on him his benison, and sends him,
with the coals, to Newcastle.

Q. On what terms are Drivers with each other?
A. On those colloquially known as “cat-and-dog” terms.
Q. Why is this P
A. The Driver's bounceable conceit, monkeyish malice, insatiable
love of squabbling and fondness for bullying and abuse, are too
enormous and ever-active to find full vent upon the general public.
To give them complete play, he is compelled to quarrel continuously
with those of his own kind.
Q. How does he manage this?
A. A Driver's faculty of spontaneous aversion is greater than that
of a party politician, whilst his powers of provocation would put
those of a nagging fishwife into the shade.
Q. What are his methods of provocation?
A. They are too numerous to name. Wilful collisions, deliberate
blocks, aggravating “nursing,” free use of the whip, and freer use
of a slangy and scurrilous tongue, are "...ºf his commoner devices.
When two Drivers differ on some small point of road etiquette
or personal demeanour, what is their course ?
A. To burst simultaneously into a savage, satirical, and generally
foul-mouthed slanging match, which is prolonged while they can
contrive to keep within ear-shot of each other, without heed to the
º of traffic, to public decency or to the convenience or comfort
of fares.
Q. But when one or other of the Drivers is in the wrong P
A. No Driver was ever known on any occasion, or in any circum-
stances, to admit himself to be in the wrong. This rule is absolute
and without exception, and is understood, indeed, to embody the

QUERY WEATHER
TUESDAY Afternoon, June 20,--Imposing entry of Lord Mayor of
Dublin. Arrived at Two o’Clock in a four-wheeler. Received in
Palace Yard by Inspector DENNING and picked detachment of A
Division. Immense sensation in crowd º the Westminster Hall.
Mr. DAWson bowed gracefully to right and left, and swept onward.
A doorkeeper nearly slain by glance from Dawsonian orbs. Hapless
official thought personage in scarlet gown was a mere London Sheriff,
and when he would have passed the bar threw himself before him.
“Terrible moment,” Mr. DAWSON told RICHARD Power at Lord
Mayor's banquet, subsequently held in dining-room. “It is well
known anybody who lays a hand on Mrs. DAwson must first step
over my dead body. That's written in Hansard; but little did I
think I should be so near entering the House of Commons over the
dead body of a doorkeeper. The caitiff drew back just in time, and
I passed on leaving him scatheless.”
elightful to see the Lord Mayor seated just below the Gangway
with the cloak folded around him.
“Like the Mother of Gracchchy, bedad,” says The O'KELLY, eyeing
him with glance of pardonable pride:
Underneath the robe tantalising glimpse of velvet tights. Round
his neck a gold chain, not the one a certain Lord Mayor of Dublin
wore on his famous visit to London; but, TREveLYAN tells me, the
veritable “collar of gold Malachi won from the proud invader.”
Always thought Malachi was a Hebrew, though of course TREveLYAN
knows, being not only a historian, but specially well up in Irish
matters. Besides General BURNABy says we are the Lost Tribes, and
this may be a heirloom.
. When the Lord Mayor spoke fresh *. caught of velvet
tights. . A graceful waving to and fro of folds of scarlet gown, an
uplifted hand to point the moral, or an indignant motion of the le
opened up vistas of velvet. Only when he sat down after impassione
harangue was House entranced by unobstructed view of velvet tights,
silk stockings hiding legs that would have made Sim Tappertit blue
with envy, and silver buckles on shoes beside which RANDolph's are
canoes. On the whole a sight never to fade from memory. Pity
the painter'sWº: or even the photographer's lens, did not seize it
ere it fled. ILFRID LAWSON, a strict economist, tells me he means
to move on the Vote for Houses of Parliament an additional sum of
£1000 for picture of “The Lord Mayor of Dublin Delivering a Peti-
tion of Corporation to House of Commons, 20th June, 1882.” Make
a capital fresco for the vacant space in Octagon Hall, next St. George
and the Dragon. Business done.—Autumn Session foreshadowed.
Tuesday Night.—Mr. LovE Jon Es PARRY made his maiden speech.
Inspiration came upon him quite suddenly. Crime Bill in Committee.
Question of omitting fowling-pieces from seizable arms. Fowling-
pieces suggest seed potatoes to Colonel NoLAN. From seed potatoes
to rooks natural transition. Colonel great on rooks.
“Members may laugh,” he says, glaring round the House as if
he would like to treat it to a whiff of gunshot, “but there are not
more than four or five questions more important in Ireland.”
Whereat a ribald House laughs again.

discourses on rooks; a little angrily at first. Temper ruffled by
Colonel NoLAN's reckless handling of subject. On the whole Loyr
JoNEs PARRY is more sorry than angry. He would be happy, he
says, to discuss rooks in private with the honourable and gallant
Gentleman. In the meantime, as a sort of first lesson, in which
House generally might share, LovE Jon Es PARRY “ventures to tell
Colonel NoLAN that young rooks make a remarkably good pie.”
Impossible to convey adequate impression of mingled shrewdness
- - and unction with which
this axiom advanced. Full
of the reminiscence of suc-
culent departed rook pie.

should be called upon in

enough, looks out for himself.

intrude. If you'll allow me, I’ll call again
to-morrow morning, as soon after sunrise as
possible, when your Friends have gone. Good clared that “the no’s

# Guests insisted they were in the majority of two, -
* Everybody cheerful at dinner except W. H. O'SULLIVAN. His
genial countenance obscured by hopelessness of prospect of reforming
the British Constitution, pacifying Ireland, and soothing the Con-
tinent, by passing his Spirits in Bond Bill. Conversation took
theological turn. Playful speculations as to where Mr. BIGGAR will
“go to” when life's weary task is accomplished. -
* We all know where O'Sullivan will go,” Dick Power said.
“Where?” asked the Regenerator of the Human Race, critically
sipping his champagne in search of silent spirit.

Thursday Night.—Why will the House persistently laugh at Mr.
CHAPLIN when he comes forward to instruct it? Came down to-
night with some really interesting, and, as Mr. TREVELYAN would
say, “novel” information about the Suez Canal. Confess I always
thought Canal ran just by Regent's Park. Have indeed smelt it.
“No,” says Mr. CHAPLIN, “it’s in Egypt, and runs from sea to sea
through a sandy desert.” In spite of this, it is filled with fresh
water pumped into it, not with a handle as you see yillage pumps,
but worked by donkey power, of which there is abundance in Cairo.
Just like a chapter out of Mangnall's Questions, only, more pic-
turesquely put. House filled with ribald laughter, and the noise of
ironical cheering. Mr. CHAPLIN stands astonished, but firm. His
duty to instruct, but cannot impart the power of appreciation.
Burning jealousy on the part of Mr. McCoAN. He didn't exactly
make the Suez Canal, but has been through it. Also, Sir GEORGE
ELLIoT rises, to show that Mr. CHAPLIN knows nothing of the
question, and has stumbled into some egregious errors of simple fact.
All jealousy, pure jealousy. Mr. CHAPLIN knows that very well, and
appreciates it at its worth. He has done his duty, and, as it were,
iif the fresh water ºf the Suez Canai on the heads of those who
scoffed at him. Business done.—Crime Bill in Committee.

When you spend your nights and days with Mr. HEALY, there comes

calm. Only a few Members present to hear a few words from Mr.
BRIGHT on the situation generally, and Land-Leaguers particularly.
John hit straight out from the shoulder. In his accustomed manner,
he called a spade a spade, and the Irish Members who attended the

HOW HE SOLD HER;
OR, THE VERY TRISTE UN WHO DIDN'T MAKE ROOM FOR
HIS UNCLE.
WAGNER's Tristan and Isolda is about the most wearisome thing
we’ve sat out for some considerable time. Had it been by a young
English composer, or an elderly English composer of the Hanwellian
School, it would not have been tolerated for
half-an-hour after its commencement. For
ourselves, if of two penances we had to
choose one, either to sit out a long, dull
sermon in a stuffy church on an August
afternoon, or to hear one Act of Tristan
and Isolda, we should unhesitatingly select
the former, where, at all events, there
would be the certainty of a tranquil repose,
from which no cruel drum, bassoon, or
violoncello, but only the snoring of our
own nose, could rouse us. That there are
occasional snatches of melody is undeniable,
but a snatch here and there is not the grasp
of a master-hand to hold an audience.
Judicious selections will always be welcome;
but that, taken as a whole, it is the embodi-
ment of stupendous boredom, must be the
verdict of all English Opera-goers who
delight in the Operas of RossINI, MozART, MEYERBEER, Gounod,
VERD1, BALFE, WALLACE, BIZET, and we are not afraid to add, even
in these days of aesthetic mysticism, art-vagueness, and higher
cultchaw—BELLINI.

Fair Isolde will be his Aunt His immoral graceless nevvy.
When his Uncle Mark she weds, Tristan rounds upon one Melot,
But Isolde and Maid their heads Once his friend—a sneaking fellow—

Drain the cup without a notion Melot's killed by Tristan's man,
They are quaffing a Love-potion. Who, in turn, dies how he can.
Each o'ercome by tºother's charms, Then Isolda’s Maid, half daft,
Falls into the other's arms. Tells about the amorous draught;
Then she marries—fie for shame!— Isolde, singing her own doom,

Till one day, just after dark, Uncle Mark, freed from the lot,
With some friends comes Uncle Mark | Blesses corpses. Such the plot:

arranged like waxworks, who, on their showing any sign of lively
melody, are at once shut up by the confidante closing the curtain
sharply, so that they are “left singing,” is such utter burlesque
that any Dramatic Critic, except an Outwagnerous Wagnerite, would
condemn the situation as ludicrous in the extreme. Then, after
they have both quaffed the cup, these are WAGNER's stage-directions.
“Both, seized with shuddering, gaze with deepest emotion, but
immoveable demeanour, into one ºff. eyes, in which the expres-
sion of defiance to death fades and melts into the glow of passion.
Trembling seizes them, they convulsively clutch their hearts, and pass
their hands over their broups.”
If this, so far, isn't good old melodramatic “business” of the most
hackneyed kind, belonging to the Victorian Era, or the palmy days
of the Drama, we don’t know it when we see it, that’s if
“Their glances again seek to meet, sink in confusion, and once
more turn with growing longing upon one another.”
This is practically carried out by Isolda and Tristan going
through wild extension motions opposite one another, until they are
locked in each other's arms, and º: situa-
tion would be satisfactory if they had only f : º
one key between them, but as it seemed to (, ; º

of them being, apparently, without the º Sº
vaguest idea of time, tune, or harmony, but ſ
only too glad to get a shriek or a growl in

observing as a sort of Happy-Thought rule,
obviously given them by that clever Herr
RICHTER,-“Keep your eye on your Con-
ductor, and your Conductor will pull you

This sort of music can never, in our life- --
time at least, thank goodness, become popu-
lar with the British public. It may, as
Dr. Johnson said of the violoncello perform-
ance, be wonderful, but we only wish it were
impossible. WAGNER's lyrical-dramatic
music requires no operatic vocalists at all. … "...”
Let there be a first-rate orchestra, a book of -
the plot in hands of the audience, and
tableaua vivants or dissolving views to illus-
trate it—as illustration is still necessary for
the illiterate. To ourselves, speaking as
mere laics in the matter, with a fondness for
tune, harmony, and good dramatic situa-
tions, it seems that singing and acting are
thrown away on such vocal music and such tedious and unsavoury
libretti. If WAGNER, his Royal patron the King of BAvARIA, and his
countrymen, generally, like this sort of thing, they are perfectly
welcome to keep it to themselves, and we don't mind hearing occa-
sionally The Flying Dutchman, The Mastersingers (abbreviated),
and selections from Tannhäuser and Lohengrin. RICHARD WAG-
NER's Operas will be remembered when the Barbiere and a few
more trifles are forgotten, but not till then.

(A Possible Prospect.)
THE chairs in the Park will be at a premium in October.
There will be no eclipse of the Stars in the Theatrical Firmament

The Continental tours of leader-writers on the London Press will
not extend beyond Boulogne.
The Irish Home-Rulers will escape the necessity of a visit to the
land of their birth and their absence until January.
The pheasants will be fed by the keepers without unseemly inter-
ruption.
}. grouse will find the moor the merrier.
The timber at Hawarden will be respited until further notice.
ToBY will represent Barkshire at St. Stephen's instead of in Cairo.
And the “dead season” will be revivified by “special desire” of
the PREMIER.

Act I.-Burglars, Swindlers, Pickpockets, et alii. Now is our
chance. Here is a crib containing some of the best plate in the country,
absolutely unguarded. , Let us crack it. Now, at the present time,
the simplest way to make money is by floating a Gold Mine, or a new
Electric Light; all we want are offices, and some ready money for
advertisements; let us float something. See there, it is Dividend
Day, and those old Ladies who are new to London, and are nervous in
the streets, have their dividends with them; let us knock them down
and rob them.
ACT II.-The Dailies. A perfect epidemic of crime seems to have set
in lately in the Metropolis.T. In another column to-day will be found
details of a burglary committed in a country house, the profits of
which must be at least £40,000; of a robbery conceived in the City
on an almost unprecedented scale, and of several brutal assaults on
elderly females, close to the Bank of England. Although, as yet
the Police have made no arrests, yet they consider they have severa
valuable clues. For the burglary they suspect a man called “Blood-
stained BILL,” a man with long hair and a flowing beard, who resides
at No. 4, Queer Street. Suspicion in the City Swindle points to Mr.
FLASHINGTON SHARP, a very fair-haired gentleman, with an abnor-
mally long moustache, who is the owner of the palatial residence
known as Gold Mine Willa, Regent's Park. And it would not at all
surprise us, if “Burly JACK' and “Smashjaw NED" were
...wanted” to-morrow for the gross outrages which have occurred in
Threadneedle Street. Meanwhile, the Press will afford the Police
every assistance.
ACT III-Bloodstained Bill. Well, this is kind of these paper chaps!
I think, ah! yes, it was hard to part with an old friend, but now that
i have 'taken off my beard, and cropped my hair, I hardly, know
myself. , Four, Queer Street; well, it is not a nice address; hardly
fashionable enough. I'll move at once.
Mr. Flashington Sharp. Thanks, awfully. I would ask the
| Editor to dinner, if I hadn't to turn out of Gold Mine Villa so hur-
riedly, on my way to Spain. It is a bit of a nuisance shaving on a
| journey, but still a big moustache is a nuisance. I’ll have it off.
Burly Jack and Smashjaw Ned. 'Ere.'s luck!
to-morrow, according to the papers. Let's off it!
ACT IV.--The Dailies. Despite the assistance afforded to them by
the Press, the Police have until now made no captures in connection
with the late crimes which have horrified London, and, indeed, the
entire country. Their stupidity, supineness, and vacillation are
simply disgraceful.

“I AM most anxious, my dear JERRY,” said the CoRINTHIAN one
morning, “to see how an old haunt of ours looks. We have seen
modern LIFE IN LONDON under various aspects, but we have not yet
had a stroll in the PARK. It was in other days the show-shop of the
Metropolis, and in the PROMENADE or ‘ Grand Strut” you saw a
mob of persons consisting not only of ‘GREAT PEOPLE,’ but the
‘soi-disant GREAT' in that ſº ive of fashion.” “I remember
it well,” said JERRY. “Shall I ever forget my first introduction to
the DUCHESS OF HEARTs and the MARCHIONESs of DIAMonDs, or BILL
DASH, Dick TRIFLE, and PLAUSIBLE JACK.” “Rum names your
friends must have had, Mr. HAWTHORN,” said young Bob, who joined
them at that moment; “but if they express their characters I think
you'll find a gºod many of the same sort about nowadays, especially
in THE Row,” “That is just the place we wish to visit, my dear
Bob,” said the CoRINTHIAN, and young LoGIC, having remarked
“All right. I'm on in that scene,” the Trio, took a lounge in the
Burlington, a stroll up and down St. James Street, and a saunter in
Piccadilly before proceeding to do “a bit of Park.”
'Twas indeed a fine sight when our heroes entered “The Park,” for
so HYDE PARK is par excellence designated. Sol, darted his beams
impartially upon swell and snob, and shone upon as gay a sight as is
afforded in The Metropolis. It would need the pen of a THACKERAY
or a SALA to do justice to the animated scene which the Artist has
depicted with a Hogarthian pencil. All LONDON appeared to be
gathered in “The Row,” and the constantchaos of carriages, and stream
of pedestrians was positively bewildering. As an epitome of LIFE IN
LoNDoN the scene afforded some rare glimpses of Character. There
was the STATESMAN on his cob, the man-about-town in his brougham,
the LEADER of FASHION in his park-phaëton, the DUCHEss in her
landau, the FAST LADY in her Victoria, and all sorts of people not “in
Society,” who fondly imagined that they made themselves part of
“THE UPPERTEN” by appearing in The Park. But ’twas a vain
illusion. “Money,” as the old proverb has it, “makes the mare to
go,” but it cannot make an English Gentleman, any more than the
sham coat of arms purchased in Cranbourn Street for the modest
sum of three-and-sixpence can give a man an ancestral tree. Wainly
does CROESUs keep a carriage, and change the homely patronymic of
BUGGINs for that of the lordly DE WERE. He is as uncomfortable
when he hears the new name as he is in the pantaloons of Pool.E, and
the sparkle of Champagne which should : his declining years,
Tom AND JERRY SHOW UP WITH YOUNG LOGIC IN THE “ROW.”

only serves to remind him of the humbler liquors of his early days.
“Psha,” cries Dives, “Riches can purchase anything,” and then he
buys a fair young wife who runs away from him; and is put up for a
fashionable Club upon which he has set his heart, and is punctually
‘PILLED.’
Thus, then, may the philosopher moralise like Drogenes, when he
takes his “afternoon Crawl'' in HYDE PARK :—
Here are the folks who are “the go,” And hard-up Tom and dashing WILL
But with the high you meet the low ; Walk past the cove who “did their

Of all the joy that “might have been.” The world's complete epitome;
The “gommy” passes yon young joker | While swell and snob walk to and fro,
Who won his tin last night at poker. And all sorts mix in Rotte N Row.
“It is in truth an animated scene,” said the CoRINThIAN ; and as
he spoke there drove past the fairest Lady in the Land, our beloved
Princess, who, with her pretty children, was taking, an airing.
Behind her sat the smartest tiger in the world, and all hats were
doffed in acknowledgment of her gracious presence.
As they strolled along, young Logic pointed out several of the
notabilities, and he also met many of his pals. These young swells
did not seem to be enjoying themselves very much, and for the most
part to be lost in the contemplation of their clothes, while they
ressed the TRIO to come into the Club, and have just “one peg.”
heir faces, however, lit up now and then as sºme rouged and
ruddled Siren drove by in a dashing. Victoria, though there were
fair young faces in the soberer vehicles which might have set
many a heart º: : but it was too clear, as the CoRINTHIAN
remarked to his Coz, that the young “Chappies” of the day were
not “marrying men,” sº because they preferred a life of selfish
pleasure to the delights of honourable wedlock. “That is all ver
well,” said young LoGIC, “but the fact is, my dear MR. ToM, it
won't run to it nowadays. We are blown up at Point Nonplus
before we are of age, and the rest of life is what that old beggar at
Chelsea called “Dust and ashes.” ToM and JERRY laughed at this
sally, which reminded them of their old friend, the Oxon LAN ; and
after a turn or two more, the TRIO left the Park.
THE ANTI-AdvowsonISTs.-Clerical “Gents,” now appearing as
obstructionists at Auctions, if they are always to be led by the Rev.
Mr. HADDEN, should prepare a finale for every occasion:-

quite reminds her of the good old times.

AT THE LATEST MEETING of the amiable dilettanti and disinterested
Theatrical Ladies and Gentlemen anxious to start a School of
Dramatic Art—perhaps for a similar reason to that of Private FRITZ,
who wished to become a Schoolmaster, in order that he might learn
to read and write—Mr. RYDER treated them to some good honest
| plain speaking: in fact, the one Ryder was worth all the proposi-
tions.
